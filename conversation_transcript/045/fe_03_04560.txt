0.71 2.70 B: hi my name is richard 

3.87 7.16 A: hi my name is steve 

7.25 8.55 B: (( steve )) 

8.75 10.38 A: (( yeah )) 

9.45 11.48 B: where are you located steve 

11.46 15.61 A: (( in d._c. yourself )) 

13.67 18.35 B: oh d._c. yeah i'm down in um [sigh] south florida in highland beach 

19.42 20.26 A: okay 

20.63 21.81 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

22.41 29.54 A: so uh affirmative action uh we're supposed to dis- be discussing affirmative action 

28.68 30.18 B: in the workplace 

30.60 32.45 A: in the workplace 

31.57 37.60 B: yeah for hiring and promotion in business at least that's what i thought i heard them say 

38.08 40.27 A: uh um do you want to start first 

40.16 43.44 B: [sigh] uh it makes no difference to me 

42.98 45.69 A: (( go ahead )) 

44.27 46.35 B: (( [sigh] um [cough] )) 

48.93 56.51 B: [sigh] yeah having retired uh from uh a a major corporation where uh affirmative action was firmly in place 

56.74 60.21 B: [sigh] uh i could see where uh [sigh] 

60.94 69.91 B: it had its advantages [sigh] and also like anything else uh where you're dealing with human beings it had its abuses um 

69.83 77.01 A: i'm sorry did did it have a explicit affirmative action or was it more of an implicit 

76.76 83.86 B: no it was definitely affirmative action because we had a um [sigh] major government contract so we were obligated 

82.83 84.03 A: oh i 

84.00 87.21 B: to have uh an affirmative action program and um 

87.81 91.54 B: uh that was reviewed uh regularly but um 

92.15 95.47 B: the uh e._e._o._c. and whoever else uh 

95.63 97.40 B: reviews these things 

97.76 98.84 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

100.70 113.16 B: uh as as long as uh [sigh] [mn] you know the the uh the the people that were being hired and promoted were qualified to do the job 

113.83 115.20 B: uh 

116.13 122.57 B: i didn't have a problem with it and i guess affirmative action wasn't only for 

122.92 124.50 B: uh 

125.68 131.61 B: uh minority racial groups that uh uh women were also covered in that category 

131.34 133.15 A: (( see right )) 

132.31 133.70 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

135.19 148.63 B: i think that there should come a time i don't know when it is i'll leave that to the gurus that uh it it that it should end um that at some point in time uh we've addressed 

148.57 153.39 B: the situation and uh 

154.57 166.16 B: and uh [sigh] you know it's it has served its purpose having said that [sigh] uh when you take a look um when you take a look at your employment pool 

166.66 171.56 B: [lipsmack] uh y- you know y- your base and if you see that um 

171.85 172.88 B: you know [lipsmack] 

173.78 187.09 B: and hopefully these figures are as realistic and as true as can be uh if your employment base is uh forty percent women and [sigh] thirty percent um 

187.18 200.08 B: hispanic and uh twenty five percent black and your workforce doesn't reflect that or it reflects something y- you know uh not even close to that then i think um 

200.45 204.62 B: if you're subject to uh the affirmative action laws then uh 

204.94 205.97 B: then 

206.13 213.48 B: you know [mn] they serve a useful purpose uh once your employment um 

214.17 217.27 B: uh reflects the uh 

217.55 224.65 B: the workforce availability uh then i think there is less and less need for 

225.15 228.14 B: um affirmative action 

228.39 239.70 A: i mean i are you um [cough] can i ask your race are you a white man i i'm assuming you're a white male 

238.86 239.91 B: yes 

239.76 243.38 A: okay i i'm i'm asian 

242.99 244.08 B: okay 

244.00 254.19 A: and i am vehemently opposed to affirmative action primarily in academia but i guess we're talking about business 

254.63 257.86 A: um i'm i'm in working for about 

258.29 261.39 A: uh four years now 

260.95 262.30 B: mhm 

261.86 275.41 A: and um and in in in my workplace [mn] i don't there there is no um explicit affirmative action program per se 

275.22 276.23 B: okay 

275.94 278.71 A: but there is definitely a 

279.22 291.97 A: a um sort of an implicit understanding of affirmative action and i you know half heartedly agree with you in that if 

292.33 296.14 A: if people were qualified and that's how 

296.40 302.47 A: um you know and race based sort of 

302.98 305.70 A: um preferences were only given 

306.36 307.00 A: (( [lipsmack] [cough] )) 

307.84 310.14 A: (( um you know as a )) 

311.08 312.50 A: (( you know as a la- [mn] )) 

312.81 319.43 A: among equally qualified candidates i would agree with you that in theory 

319.56 327.89 A: um you know that program might work but in actuality and in practice [mn] that's not what happens it's 

327.83 338.09 A: that you know the the people who were hired under the umbrella of affirmative action tend to be lesser qualified candidates 

337.77 339.47 B: (( or [cough] )) 

339.80 352.34 B: that's true and that's a problem with management that's not a problem with the um [sigh] with the with the principle of affirmative action [sigh] the other thing that happens and i i agree with you [sigh] is what we're seeing today with that um 

352.44 362.93 B: with that reporter uh from the new york times um they get on this program and they so want him to look good that they they they are given breaks that um 

362.85 377.37 B: that nobody else in the world would be given because it'd make their management look bad [sigh] and so if you've got a high enough placed godfather or a mentor or whatever the politically correct word is for these people 

370.25 371.25 A: right 

377.31 378.98 B: um 

379.20 389.94 B: uh you're going to be given a lot more slack than uh a mere mortal without such a highly placed m- uh godfather uh would ever be given 

390.31 393.31 B: [lipsmack] an and i think one of the reasons um 

393.37 403.61 B: [lipsmack] that you probably don't even hear the term affirmative action [sigh] much any me- more because uh the more politically correct phrase these days is diversity 

404.75 412.21 B: [sigh] um anything done in the name of diversity is uh the new is the panacea of the twenty first century 

405.19 406.13 A: right 

412.70 418.63 B: uh so they don't use the phrase affirmative action uh because it's kind of worn out um 

419.02 424.51 B: and and um i- i- if you detect some disdain for um 

424.79 430.46 B: uh what is politically correct and what's not politically correct then uh disdain for just the um 

430.86 432.11 B: uh 

432.44 434.26 B: that mind um 

434.89 438.83 B: bent in society and in politics um 

439.48 441.58 B: you're correct um 

441.73 444.00 A: and i mean it's uh 

444.84 449.11 A: i i am i am all for um 

448.88 456.77 A: diversity of viewpoints and diversity of ideas 

452.00 454.09 B: mhm 

455.43 456.82 B: right 

456.66 458.83 A: but that um 

458.76 462.58 A: that doesn't mean that just because you have 

462.53 476.25 A: racial diversity or gender diversity doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have uh you're going to achieve diversity of ideas or diversity of viewpoints 

475.37 476.88 B: i agree 

476.81 477.84 A: um 

477.89 487.63 A: which is where i have most problems and and another problem with affirmative action is that um [lipsmack] 

488.25 494.67 A: (( uh you know it it tends to work in a [lipsmack] in a quota in practice )) 

494.10 496.26 B: [cough] it sure does 

495.39 503.50 A: and in which case it works also as a cap for um uh sort of successful minorities 

503.76 510.95 A: um and i keep on going back to academia but if you take a look at uh you know 

511.11 525.04 A: asian candidates they tend to be over qualified for a lot of um positions and um academic institutions for which they um don't get equal treatment 

511.11 512.29 B: and and and 

524.73 528.80 B: and in industry uh i haven't seen 

529.10 534.28 B: uh [mn] [sigh] i haven't at least until the time i retired i hadn't seen it as a cap 

534.35 542.31 B: what i did see is that it was real easy to meet your quotas and that's exactly what they were [sigh] at the lower levels 

541.88 543.43 A: right 

542.36 544.26 B: but then there was this push 

544.21 548.21 B: to get them to reach exceedingly higher levels so 

548.16 558.09 B: oh we don't have enough female or minority vice presidents we don't have enough of them at the director level [sigh] and so they'd rush 'em through 

553.37 554.53 A: right 

557.91 563.40 B: and the faster they'd rush 'em through [sigh] the more unqualified they were when they got to this 

563.22 564.32 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

563.46 572.41 B: you know [sigh] to whatever ceiling they were trying to impress the government that we were uh meeting our quotas in and um [sigh] 

572.33 580.06 B: so it really did a a great disservice to the whole concept of affirmative action because the faster they moved them through 

580.35 589.53 B: rather than take the time that it would take you know a normal uh non uh protected uh employee 

589.66 591.30 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

592.36 599.89 B: [mn] be you know it was almost uh they were just setting them up for failure and everybody and then everybody'd go look see you know they're promoting 

596.48 597.52 A: right
