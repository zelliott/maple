306.63 309.64 A: it actually starts from the end and then it goes 

309.58 323.79 A: to the beginning and it's like it's full of flashbacks and everything you know it just tells about the f- five minutes and then it goes back ten minutes and it starts from that ten minutes and tells the story and everything you go oh yeah that's it and then 

323.83 336.50 A: it goes f- ten minutes back and then well i it's just really cool i mean it's a it's a new idea and uh i think it's definitely not overrated i mean everyone loves it and it's really cool you should watch it
