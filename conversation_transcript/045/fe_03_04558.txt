0.55 1.35 B: (( [noise] )) 

2.21 5.74 A: hello i'm shaker um 

6.77 7.71 A: (( how are you )) 

7.75 10.22 B: i'm daniel how are you doing 

9.56 10.67 A: (( what's up )) 

10.32 11.39 B: what's going on 

11.78 13.69 A: uh so you're [sigh] 

13.88 16.10 A: so the topic is affirmative action 

15.81 21.84 B: yeah affirmative action [noise] [noise] uh i think it's a good policy [noise] 

17.54 18.53 A: (( what do you think you )) 

20.78 22.19 A: think it's a good policy 

21.92 24.95 B: yeah because 

22.91 27.78 A: uh why's that just so this so that everybody gets a [sigh] a crack at it [sigh] 

25.92 28.87 B: a fair shake at every yeah [sigh] because 

28.95 38.17 B: it it's like you're already discriminated against for for your color and if everybody had a fair chance at it it's like everybody the best man would win 

38.17 50.62 A: well what about that person out there who is [sigh] um let's just say there's there's a there are two um two people applying for a job and one person was was black and one person is um 

47.16 47.85 B: (( mm )) 

50.75 53.67 A: let's say indian like me i mean i'm indian 

52.09 52.99 B: mhm 

53.37 54.18 B: (( okay )) 

53.74 54.84 A: and um 

55.74 63.29 A: and then there's another person who's white right and they all have and let's just say that the white the per- person who's white has a better 

57.59 58.64 B: mhm 

63.39 67.39 A: resume and has more experience and [mn] is probably better for the job 

67.08 68.41 B: mhm 

67.80 72.22 A: um but what the affirmative action policy um 

71.36 74.12 B: mhm the minorities will get uh hired 

72.33 73.19 A: and that 

73.35 82.73 A: the minority will get the job uh even though the you know the other person who's white [sigh] so in a sense it it in under that circumstance wouldn't wouldn't you say that 

74.81 75.66 B: mhm 

82.03 92.93 B: under that circumstance but i don't think every circumstance is like that though i don't think i don't think you can just put one example on it [sigh] if for that one of example there are hundreds of examples [sigh] where the minority doesn't get looked just because of his color 

85.14 85.94 A: right 

87.88 88.57 A: right 

92.85 95.10 A: i agree with that yeah i agree with that 

94.55 99.09 B: so it's like you can look at it both ways as as a positive and negative 

97.15 97.88 A: right 

98.90 108.69 A: [sigh] i wish i wish there was a way that you could find out uh for all the different cases which ones were the one that i said and which ones were the ones that we agreed on do you know what i'm saying 

104.76 106.25 B: actually 

107.34 109.22 B: yeah yeah uh-huh 

109.24 117.80 A: you that way otherwise you know that way we can uh [sigh] it it would be a lot easier to say [sigh] yes or no that's why it's such a debatable topic 'cause i mean if it's 

115.88 117.16 B: yeah 

117.73 127.82 A: [mn] some places have see the problem is some places have a quota they have like you know we want to hire twenty to thirty or forty minorities and that's their quota [sigh] 

123.70 125.24 B: this many minorities 

126.11 127.31 B: yeah 

128.46 132.87 A: you know if it's forty people and then there's a certain number of people applying then 

133.13 139.81 A: you know uh depending on how many slots have already been filled if there is ten ten people left to to fill and uh 

140.06 142.51 A: you know however many applicants left [lipsmack] 

141.20 144.42 B: (( mhm )) 

143.63 149.38 A: you know there it it's bound to happen where one of where there's going to be another applicant who is white or not 

149.35 150.39 B: the minority 

149.67 155.56 A: colored who's going to get a just because it's so in that sense it's because of the color of their skin also but in the opposite way 

155.16 156.90 B: yeah yeah 

155.94 156.73 A: (( you know )) 

157.26 158.07 A: so 

157.96 167.96 B: but it's it like as as you just put it it's like maybe it's not a good program in that way but i can't say that because 

167.89 177.48 B: it ha- has it's happened to so many people i know in all kinds of things that where they just didn't get looked at just because of their color so it's like they weren't given the opportunity at all [noise] 

174.64 175.38 A: right 

176.52 181.78 A: well are you sure are you like a hundred percent positive that's because of their color or what [mn] like 

180.84 181.74 B: (( [noise] )) 

182.05 183.08 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

182.12 192.14 A: like it's hard it's hard to i know i i understand what you mean like if if you if there's a job and [sigh] and it doesn't seem like there's a reason why they should not get [sigh] that they shouldn't get overlooked uh 

183.53 184.52 B: yeah 

185.45 186.85 B: beca- because there's no 

191.24 191.97 B: (( mhm )) 

192.33 196.51 A: [sigh] you know then you could pretty much draw the conclusion that oh it might be the of their skin but 

195.91 197.28 B: yeah 

196.65 204.82 A: it's hard it's something that's just speculation too maybe maybe there was really a better applicant but it's hard when th- when there's every single job that you get denied 

204.46 205.80 B: mhm 

205.20 207.45 A: then you got to speculate that it's the color you know 

206.70 213.52 B: [sigh] yeah there's no concrete evidence but just if it happens so many times you have to wonder you know what what's really going on 

209.18 210.01 A: right 

213.38 214.44 A: exactly 

213.83 216.18 B: if it's like a black man ge- 

216.26 227.64 B: uh if any minority applies for a job [sigh] and it's like one they if they they see a resume they don't know what color you are but once they see you in the office it's like they just get turned off by it you can tell by their attitude 

219.01 219.73 A: right 

227.14 228.48 A: (( [sigh] right )) 

227.99 238.32 B: and that's like what can we do about that and that's like affirmative action to implement this sort of program that would help kinda alleviate that problem [lipsmack] but at the same time causes new problems 

238.43 239.63 A: (( right [sigh] )) 

238.68 239.27 B: (( [sigh] )) 

239.53 247.91 B: 'cause like how do you go about alleviating these little problems that affirmative action causes [sigh] when it's been put when it's been put to help help a problem 

243.97 244.97 A: exactly 

248.10 249.02 B: (( you know )) 

248.12 249.03 A: mhm 

250.42 256.76 A: [sigh] it's a tough one i mean i i i know i don't know if i was a politician i'm not sure what i would do i mean i know [sigh] 

251.51 252.36 B: mhm 

256.81 268.29 A: like you said you know y- you you install an affirmative action plan or a policy or something on the niche and and for some you know there's going to be a lot of good that comes out of it like you said a lot of black americans are going to get jobs 

261.63 262.70 B: mhm 

266.01 268.10 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] all right )) 

268.42 272.73 A: but then you're going to take away jobs from other people who deserve it also 

271.98 274.98 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah yeah i i see what you're talking about )) 

274.72 282.90 A: i mean it's hard i mean it's not as clear cut as yes or no i don't think it's it really it depends on the situation it depends on you know a a lot of different things 

277.60 279.13 B: (( yeah it's because )) 

281.82 289.78 B: mhm yes it's definitely not yes or no you can't just say yes it's good or yes it's bad or you know but you'd have to [sigh] 

288.53 289.32 A: right 

289.85 298.63 B: look at both both sides and see what's really going on 'cause [sigh] if you could really get concrete evidence as you said earlier to how the it really shakes out then you could have a kind of 

299.08 303.47 B: opinion on it we're just like really it's basically our opinion right now 

299.97 301.45 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

303.38 309.53 A: yeah i guess the best thing would be to like pretty much sit down on a computer or something and and take a look at a lot of 

309.13 310.14 B: yeah 

309.50 321.16 A: facts and stuff on online and just take a look at the statistics as you know as far as the trends are are concerned with [sigh] minorities being hired and and what types of com- companies hire minorities and things like that 

316.92 317.84 B: mhm 

320.58 321.67 B: yeah 

321.02 333.82 A: you know how many employers are there and [sigh] and you could start seeing some trends you know and start seeing how many applicants were hir- were interviewed for you know minorities were interviewed and all of this i'm sure there's a way there's a really good system out there for that 

324.96 325.89 B: mhm 

333.29 334.75 B: mhm 

334.07 343.23 A: we just we're we're just talking just from our personal experiences you know but i'm sure there's a lot more evidence to to one of our um 

338.00 339.59 B: yeah from what we hear 

343.45 344.22 A: (( you know )) 

343.90 345.07 B: yeah 

344.48 345.65 A: for what we're thinking 

347.03 358.79 A: [noise] so but what about like what about that type of that type of thing implemented in um forget about the job force what about like in a [sigh] college or something like that admissions when when people 

347.13 348.12 B: (( yeah that's )) 

359.29 359.85 A: (( [mn] )) 

359.45 363.22 B: yeah you know i i've i've heard that before and it's 

363.56 371.00 B: kind of the same it's kind of the same uh situation i think not the same but 'cause i've i even know white people white 

370.88 384.58 B: f- friends [sigh] that said they weren't given a scholarship just because they're white but there's a a black person of the same grade that didn't get a scholarship that got the scholarship actually and they were like it's not fair but i was and i kind of the argument i gave to him was 

374.21 377.10 A: (( um )) 

379.02 379.86 A: right 

381.26 381.93 A: right 

384.65 394.10 B: the the look at the schooling you were at and the schooling he was at and how hard it was and just the things he had to overcome to get those grades 

394.07 403.65 B: which is like and he's he's he's black and he has to apply to a school and you're white and you have to apply to a school but it's like he's given different obstacles for being a black man 

403.86 404.91 A: (( [noise] right )) 

404.56 416.19 B: to go to actually get to college is like a big accomplishment and he may take it for granted that he's in in college [sigh] but that black man is like you know i'm in college [sigh] and just may be the first person in his family to be at a college 

407.70 408.77 A: right 

415.77 422.32 A: right and and you could be talking about you could be talking about black men that it just what makes it harder is that you could be talking about a black man who's been 

422.35 424.74 A: [sigh] growing up in a in a tough community 

424.37 425.34 B: mhm 

424.70 435.92 A: and it works like none of his family members have gone to college and it's just an incredible accomplishment just to get to college but then you could be talking about a black man who is living in uh like upper middle class family who's like 

429.39 430.22 B: yeah 

434.84 436.21 B: yeah yeah true 

435.79 448.37 A: you know you know his whole family's at college and you know so it all really again it really depends on and i'm not going to sit here and say i'm not going to sit here and say that most black people come from poorer poor income pl- places but 

438.76 439.60 B: uh-huh 

442.12 442.91 B: yeah 

447.54 448.95 B: yeah 

448.28 454.15 A: you know maybe some do maybe some don't i don't know but it all depends on which which black man we're talking about you know 

453.26 462.27 B: yeah it's a bit different and at the same that which which white man are you talking about because it's it's it's not all easy for white people either i understand that being a black man i understand it's not easy for everybody 

457.25 458.07 A: right 

459.05 460.60 A: exactly right 

461.57 463.25 A: (( [noise] right )) 

463.14 465.51 B: everybody has different struggles to overcome in their own lives 

465.55 476.13 A: right i i mean i understand the whole point is to make make it fair for everybody it shouldn't really be [sigh] you know you affirmative action i think is pretty much like you want to make it so that [sigh] 

476.02 480.68 A: there is absolutely zero consideration to race or color like none 

479.68 481.38 B: yeah uh-huh 

480.71 492.96 A: like basically if there's five guys in there and no matter w- who they are [sigh] if they ha- all have you know good credentials you look at just that and you don't make any tie breakers with with color and or skin 

488.33 489.26 B: mhm 

492.71 499.18 B: yeah but that's not soci- society we live in though in the society we live in we see color and it's probably the first thing we see 

497.59 498.33 A: right 

499.25 501.90 A: i know and the problem is affirmative action 

502.04 504.55 A: [sigh] you know it it it sort of 

504.67 519.66 A: it sort of still tells you to look at color because you know there's going to be a sort of a quota [sigh] that that [mn] you want to like you you know how i just said the tie breaker there should be no tie breaker when it comes to college and getting one affirmative action is there there is a tie breaker and the black man will get it over the white guy 

507.64 508.55 B: yeah 

509.56 510.79 B: mhm 

517.89 518.80 B: uh-huh 

519.26 520.46 B: yeah 

519.81 525.18 A: you know that's the way it works out so it it's so weird you know it's kinda like contradictory almost 

524.49 526.02 B: mhm yeah 

525.39 527.70 A: you know but i don't know it's 

527.68 534.71 A: it's it's totally got its good points and bad points and i could see how it's so hard to implement some policy as a as a president or as a [sigh] 

534.53 543.64 A: politician or whatever it would be incredibly difficult it wouldn't [sigh] there's no no ten minute conversation is going to be able to you're not going to be able to to come up with a conclusion like that 

543.09 546.17 B: yeah nah no no clear cut conclusion anyway 

543.90 544.75 A: (( you know )) 

546.20 548.61 A: no clear cut con- conclusion right 

546.88 558.63 B: and yeah like i said earlier it's been im- im- it's it's been put to fix the problem [sigh] but it's actually creating more problems i don't want to say problems but it's actually creating more [sigh] more situations we have to get through 

558.87 559.78 A: yeah 

559.26 565.92 B: 'cause of society you know you you say don't look at color but this program says look at color mhm 

563.38 571.03 A: right exactly and then if you don't have the program then you know color's going looked at going be looked at but in a negative way 

570.57 572.43 B: yeah exactly 

571.79 573.81 A: you know so it's like you can't win 

573.59 576.06 B: yeah you're kind of caught between a rock and a hard place 

573.82 575.53 A: (( eith- either win you can't win )) 

576.02 578.48 A: (( exactly and that yeah so [sigh] )) 

577.24 578.70 B: mhm 

578.72 588.90 A: you know but i guess the whole goal is just just to to you know forget obviously throw out color if you just if you throw out that whole that whole part of the application that tells you you know what race you are 

588.50 590.17 B: yeah they shouldn't have that 

588.90 595.59 A: and that that's also i actually it's a good thing because they they they write down that it's optional on a lot of applications a 

595.03 596.28 B: yeah 

595.70 598.09 A: sort of let out you know you don't have to fill that out 

597.59 598.96 B: mhm 

598.31 599.89 A: (( but the problem is schools fill that out ))
