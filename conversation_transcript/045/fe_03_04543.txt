46.77 48.46 B: um 

48.92 57.24 B: i don't know how i feel about that i mean if somebody is able to do the job in the work community then uh there should be no discrimination 

57.48 58.71 A: right 

57.89 66.75 B: if they're not capable of it doesn't matter whether they're black white asian indian or whatever [laughter] if they're not capable

76.60 77.76 A: right 

77.07 85.88 B: and why should people that can't do the job be able to um just because they're uh let's say a minority i mean that's what i'm thinking it's about

107.94 109.84 A: mhm 

108.56 110.39 B: but um 

110.51 118.34 B: but as far as if that's what they're asking then i would say um you know to the best person who can do the job 

118.22 121.59 A: right yeah that's what i feel too 

122.27 123.60 A: (( um )) 

124.73 128.58 A: (( but uh you know i ain't [laughter] [noise] )) 

130.15 131.77 A: okay but uh 

130.95 133.13 B: you can be honest i guess i mean 

132.62 139.53 A: okay but what i'm thinking about saying is you know my my wife is hispanic and i know that the 

139.49 153.38 A: demisgr- what is it the uh discrimination that she's pa- has had to face in you know her life it's not that bad as it was when she was a little girl but it's still 

144.30 145.44 B: right 

153.41 160.27 A: you know she still has the uh scars emotionally from the discrimination that she had to put up with 

160.97 162.39 A: so 

162.44 166.83 B: but i don't know how old she is now but that was it must have been a long time ago 

164.58 168.14 A: right yeah that was a long time ago 

167.52 180.99 B: right it maybe left scars but today i there's lawsuits if people discriminate even if the discrimination against let's say um a woman can say that a man or a man can say that a woman has been sexually harassing them 

180.56 181.80 A: (( mhm )) 

181.15 189.28 B: you know i mean we've we've come a long way and now there are laws and uh lawsuits to prevent that 

181.84 183.29 A: yeah i know 

184.47 185.25 A: (( mm )) 

189.04 189.86 A: (( mm )) 

189.60 193.98 B: but yeah the scars are there but i don't know if they're talking about then or now 

193.48 197.40 A: yeah [sigh] yeah 

195.58 209.11 B: i know that in the schools i mean i i am a college graduate and i know that um they lowered the um when i was in high school uh when you got your uh degree you would get uh 

209.20 219.08 B: they lowered it from like i think seventy to sixty five so that the people who um could not make the marks were able to graduate 

218.47 220.54 A: (( um mhm )) 

219.33 225.75 B: and if you don't do the studying then [mn] i'm very hard on that [laughter] you know like 

223.92 228.46 A: [laughter] yeah right you don't get in there and do it 

228.15 229.47 B: yeah 

228.89 231.10 A: then you shouldn't get the marks 

230.60 243.16 B: exactly i mean if you why should you not do the work and be a little lazy or if you need extra help there's always tutoring in the schools why should they be allowed to graduate they should do summer school that type of thing 

238.38 239.36 A: (( mm )) 

242.91 244.20 A: right 

243.55 254.64 B: and i think the same as in the workplace you have to work and work harder some people do have to work harder there are people who are disabled they have to work a little harder but they're still given the option 

254.34 256.04 A: mhm 

255.64 267.85 B: you know tha- that's how i feel about it i mean you you see if differently i guess because you've lived with somebody who has been discriminated against but does she have a good job now or is she a 

264.90 266.52 A: (( mm yeah )) 

267.75 272.04 A: well i'm afraid right now she's on uh disability so 

271.29 272.55 B: oh 

272.29 278.99 A: but she has had yeah good jobs in the past so it hasn't held her back in you know getting 

275.22 276.52 B: mhm 

279.61 285.07 A: uh jobs at this time so that's good so 

281.82 282.85 B: right 

285.73 290.38 A: that's good d- uh [mn] well yeah its good but 

290.90 302.78 A: uh i guess what's running through my mind is is the the government mandating that you like you mentioned earlier the government mandating that you hire um 

303.30 309.37 A: say eighty percent white uh ten percent you know minorities or 

309.51 310.79 A: i i mean d-
