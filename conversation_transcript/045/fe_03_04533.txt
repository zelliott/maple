12.79 14.56 A: (( don't know that they do a lot of it now i used to work for the federal )) 

15.49 27.64 A: (( government many years ago and they had affirmative action [cough] unless you were military if you had uh a guy that was applying for the same job and a woman that was applying for the same job and they were equal the woman got it because it was like trying to get more women on board um and of course it was the same thing like minority races and that sort of thing they would do that give you know give the minorities a better chance of of getting on um it it really caused a lot of )) 

28.97 38.98 A: (( ill feelings in some instances um it probably helped some people get a foot in the door that they probably couldn't get otherwise that didn't have the experience but then again you you need to look at i think if it's )) 

41.01 43.31 A: (( a business and they're wanting to hire the best person )) 

44.76 47.66 A: (( they need to hire the best person and in that instance affirmative action really isn't )) 

48.29 49.34 B: (( my )) 

52.16 53.12 B: (( name's )) 

53.30 54.20 B: (( john )) 

55.40 56.27 B: (( i'm )) 

56.47 60.03 B: (( good uh sure uh affirmative action )) 

60.17 61.32 B: (( in the workplace )) 

63.00 67.02 B: (( uh is sometimes a good thing but like )) 

68.33 72.90 B: (( when it comes down to like making things equal )) 

73.48 74.79 B: (( and )) 

75.11 79.11 B: (( making sure people get the right choice where i think there )) 

79.87 81.90 B: (( might be misunderstanding )) 

82.82 84.62 B: (( i just )) 

85.04 87.99 B: (( woke up and )) 

89.04 91.53 B: (( um thinking affirmative action )) 

91.58 95.44 B: (( to like equal opportunity employers )) 

96.16 97.13 B: (( like )) 

97.72 100.52 B: (( uh like quotas and whatnot )) 

100.79 102.92 B: (( that's how that's how )) 

103.88 106.16 B: (( i'm taking it i'm like )) 

106.44 110.56 A: that great yeah it's almost like they expect uh 

110.98 115.82 A: minorities to not uh whoever thought of the idea of affirmative action it's 

114.76 117.10 B: (( just yeah )) 

115.99 117.55 A: like trying 

117.71 122.93 A: they're n- they're just trying to have a good idea in trying to get more minorities in the workplace but it's almost as if 

122.96 129.79 A: they thought that minorities wanted to do this on their own without help so it's kind of like a prejudiced idea to begin with 

125.77 127.68 B: (( yeah )) 

130.42 131.73 A: and uh 

132.55 135.99 A: like you can understand wanting to get more minorities so they won't really you 

136.29 141.13 A: know so the word minorities won't have like a negative tone to it 

139.91 141.57 B: yeah definitely 

141.37 144.26 A: like and it does still sometimes 

141.84 142.73 B: well 

144.15 149.29 B: i i speaking from my experience when the position i was talking about before 

149.36 150.31 B: um 

150.50 153.75 B: i was really qualified for the job and i don't know 

154.88 161.28 B: the the only people that applied for it was those that were working part time anyway somebody that wanted a full time job 

161.21 170.98 B: [cough] so we were all doing about the same thing but i had a when i got hired on i had a co worker he wasn't my supervisor but he had worked for the federal government 

171.11 172.41 B: for a long time 

172.64 176.18 B: and because of affirmative action he kind of had a chip on his shoulder 

176.55 180.46 B: and he was afraid that because i was the woman i was going to get something that he 

176.67 178.44 A: mhm 

180.52 194.40 B: wasn't going to be able to get so whenever they would send something to me about training like stress handle how to handle stress for women or something like that he would train up for it so he would get it [laughter] so i mean you know he would have that opportunity to go 

194.89 208.10 B: and it really caused a lot of problems and i think a lot of it was because if it wasn't that i was hired because of affirmative action if i was just hired because you know i was i was the only one or i was the best one or whatever it would have been a little bit different 

208.27 212.24 B: so i think it causes a lot of problems in some situations 

212.00 218.42 A: yeah but uh also i mean i can understand where they coming from to get it into place because 

216.13 217.97 B: (( yeah )) 

218.44 221.48 A: uh some people weren't given the right opportunities 

220.83 222.14 B: right 

221.93 224.59 A: (( like uh they're like )) 

224.61 227.59 A: it's not it's not trying to be racist but um 

227.61 232.55 A: majorities do get some of the you know better opportunities 

230.88 234.91 B: oh the better breaks yeah definitely 

233.10 238.39 A: especially [mn] like different areas of the country still still now 

238.00 239.42 B: oh yeah sure 

239.18 240.53 A: (( i guess it's still a )) 

239.49 240.30 B: um 

240.74 242.77 A: delicate subject 

240.84 241.53 B: you 

242.22 246.51 B: you you probably have a lot of uh companies 

246.66 248.41 B: that 

248.25 251.15 B: do try to equal out and i 

250.99 260.47 B: you know i'm about the same as you i don't want to sound racist but it's not me anyway it's the companies we're talking about a lot of times they'll have a token person in there just so they can say look what we got 

260.27 268.33 B: whether it's a handicapped person or a hispanic person or a black person or a woman you know or a black woman or you know whatever 

268.46 270.44 B: um just so they can 

271.64 276.97 B: say well we've we've got what we need in here so the rest everybody else we hire can just be 

277.22 283.67 B: you know what we've always had in instead of trying to look for a you know it's like i said that token person 

283.99 285.85 A: (( uh yeah )) 

284.02 286.35 B: so a lot of times that's a problem 

286.36 292.20 A: yeah i don't remember where i heard this but um i thought i heard it from a friend i might be mistaken but uh 

292.51 296.32 A: his dad was a manager and he was in charge of human resources 

296.30 309.54 A: and it w- came down to when he had the you know equal out the task force i guess like i guess they're supposed to do it for every certain number you get you have to have this this number and this number 

302.29 303.27 B: mhm 

306.76 308.39 B: (( yeah )) 

310.11 311.45 A: but um 

312.06 316.24 A: i thought like i don't remember they get the company gets 

316.67 321.00 A: pays less taxes maybe i think i might be wrong or something 

318.33 319.70 B: (( mm )) 

319.72 327.67 B: no i think i heard something like that they get some kind of i don't know if it's a task tax break but it's something yeah yeah they get a better benefit package 

323.97 326.49 A: more of a benefit package thing i guess 

327.70 333.66 B: [mn] because they're show- they're showing that they come in compliance with but you know i like i said this was uh 

334.22 335.56 B: like nineteen 

336.81 341.21 B: i'm thinking ninety one or ninety it's not pushed so much now 

341.44 348.05 B: and i don't think you know and it was definitely government policies federal government policy back then i don't know what it is now 

348.49 350.28 B: [mn] but uh it 

348.71 353.94 A: (( yeah i remember this was this was about five years ago or further than that )) 

351.33 356.88 B: yeah yeah yeah i'm sure uh there's still probably still a lot of uh 

356.95 360.40 B: companies that try to get into that situation where they 

360.40 372.19 B: if there's some government programme that they know they can get a benefit out if it if they do x y and z then they'll do it just so they can get that benefit [mn] and a lot of times it helps and sometimes it's really not 

368.23 369.61 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

373.11 378.84 A: it does look good for the company too to be more uh what they call friends of earth 

378.30 380.02 B: yeah 

379.05 382.38 A: even though sometimes it might not be the 

382.53 388.72 A: better choice this the better opinion for everybody i guess i suppose 

389.24 396.52 B: yeah you kind of have to look at the education situation like um in some states there's still 

396.90 400.05 B: a lot of rul- rural areas that don't get the 

400.60 412.72 B: [sigh] big schools or the big programmes that benefit the kids so everybody across the nation doesn't get the same education and they try to get a better life for theirself [cough] regardless of their race or 

413.29 414.86 B: sex or whatever 

414.89 424.74 B: go to a larger town and try to get on it and find out that they can't the only thing they can do is men- you know menial jobs they never get their foot in the door because they just don't have the 

424.95 429.23 B: (( excuse me educational background that some of the other schools have )) 

428.96 430.91 A: mhm 

432.19 433.11 A: um 

435.57 439.92 A: i i've never really dealt with that i haven't been in the same situations that you have 

439.36 440.93 B: mhm 

439.97 442.99 A: when it came down to me or another person 

442.60 444.34 B: yeah 

444.27 445.62 A: but uh 

447.20 450.98 A: like overall i still i k- kind of agree with it because 

451.57 452.44 A: uh 

452.63 454.22 A: you know people were 

454.90 460.89 A: you know discrimination does happen and i guess there just they're still trying to avoid that and maybe that is just something that i've got to get over with 

460.73 464.17 B: [cough] well then you got to look at it is it reverse discrimination 

464.20 468.44 B: if they do go with it because the guy's standing there thinking 

468.32 481.92 B: this woman's going to get hired because of affirmative action and she's going to get all these benefits and all these extra things all these goodies i'm not going to get because i'm a a white male forty years old or fifty years old and uh 

482.32 494.49 B: then they want to say well now you're discriminating against me you know you're giving uh a white woman or a black woman or a black man or a hispanic woman a opportunity to do so and so 

494.75 497.69 B: but what about me you're not giving me that opportunity 

498.85 500.02 A: [noise] yeah 

498.90 502.28 B: so then you got to look at the at the reverse of that too 

503.08 506.35 B: and i think that i have read where there were several uh 

503.54 504.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

507.35 510.53 B: types of law suits that they were 

510.59 515.29 B: going through saying that this is reverse discrimination because 

515.35 520.97 B: because of affirmative action i didn't know what affirmative action was till i got hired on that job 

521.42 523.15 A: (( yeah it is a )) 

521.52 524.63 B: [laughter] [cough] then i uh found out about it pretty quick 

524.72 528.13 A: touchy thing and it's hard to put in writing too because you 

527.69 528.44 B: (( mm )) 

528.94 533.22 A: know people's different reactions different opinions and experiences with it 

532.93 534.73 B: right right 

536.07 537.01 B: um 

537.31 539.66 B: a lot of people i would say that are 

540.73 542.07 B: maybe 

543.40 556.35 B: twenty maybe under twenty years old that really haven't been in the workforce a lot maybe maybe even a little older than that that haven't been out in the workforce they don't they haven't really encountered that kind of stuff like you said four or five ten years ago 

556.68 560.09 B: was when it was first start starting to be pushed and uh 

560.95 567.41 B: a lot of people just haven't had um uh i wouldn't say opportunity but they haven't had the situation 

567.70 568.87 B: where they've been 

570.18 574.27 B: looked over for a job you know because of that because it just wasn't 

574.87 583.27 B: it just wasn't that prevalent now like it was back then least i don't see it uh i work for the state that i live in now and they don't have any of that they you know 

583.33 587.12 B: they don't don't mention it they advertise that they don't have it you know so 

587.32 591.14 B: uh i guess evidently the state didn't think it was a good idea to begin with 

591.70 594.19 A: (( no i haven't heard much about it either i've )) 

593.56 595.42 B: mhm 

594.66 599.22 A: heard of reverse uh with reverse discrimination topic pop up more and more though 

598.54 599.90 B: yeah yeah
