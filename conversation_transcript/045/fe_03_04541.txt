0.00 1.84 A: (( [noise] get her out of here if i'm gonna talk )) 

1.61 4.20 B: (( hi this is kim who am i speaking with )) 

3.31 5.84 A: [noise] uh marvin 

5.54 8.42 B: oh hi marvin i'm over here in los angeles 

8.43 10.42 A: oh i'm in tucson arizona 

10.14 11.54 B: oh wow 

11.62 12.47 B: (( and i'm )) 

11.82 14.64 A: nice and warm ni- nice and warm tucson 

12.55 13.11 B: (( [mn] )) 

14.47 16.54 B: oh yeah and your name again 

16.91 18.07 A: 'scuse me 

17.46 19.04 B: i'm sorry what's your name again 

18.84 20.07 A: marvin 

19.61 20.90 B: marvin hi 

20.89 34.69 B: yeah marvin actually i i thought it was uh quite interesting that um when they brought up this particular topic and it was hard to understand on the computer what they were what the topic was but then i was ending up able to make out what they said but um 

33.58 35.36 A: (( um )) 

34.92 40.09 B: (( what what is what i- how do how do you feel do you have an opinion about um )) 

39.47 41.11 A: affirmative action 

40.95 41.90 B: (( yes )) 

41.17 55.52 A: one one minute i think it's good and one minute it i think it's d- i i i i i can see both views of it i think like a lot of people they don't have the right education or come from like my daughter we live in a a better part o- o- of tucson 

55.38 56.29 B: yeah 

55.51 63.94 A: we live in a class and she gets a very good education i mean d- d- it's a very good school and and they always test they do very very well so 

58.50 59.47 B: right 

63.77 71.00 A: she's you know she's getting the right you know the building blocks and then again if you lived in the inner cities it's terrible they don't they do 

71.45 77.99 A: like a third of what they should do [noise] so if someone's coming like from an inner city school maybe they should get a break 

77.93 81.61 B: you know and i i totally actually agree with that and it 

80.77 81.90 A: really 

81.78 88.92 B: and it's the same way that i feel in here in los angeles is that i think a lot could be done as far as the affirmative action with the system i mean 

88.75 101.03 B: there are some obviously good and bad points in every in every situation but i think from that standpoint affirmative action yes to a degree in certain ways and not affirmative action in other ways i think that can hinder 

101.07 102.93 B: you know to a degree 

102.98 103.98 B: (( and )) 

102.99 106.78 A: really and then yeah and then another i'm sorry go on 

104.39 105.65 B: (( and if that's the oh )) 

105.98 108.55 B: (( i'm sorry i was just going to say especially education )) 

109.20 110.44 A: really 

109.90 115.43 B: yeah that as as far as los angeles that's what i feel i i think that there's some strong points on 

115.37 127.10 B: on what you know should be you know put down in cement so to speak and there's other things that they have in force that have actually hurt the system and so i- it's kind of like a mixed mixed feeling about it 

127.11 130.96 A: right and in the other way i'm feeling then i then i feel just the opposite way 

130.75 143.01 A: if somebody's going to colle- uh th- then it depends what kind of profession it is of this profession where where somebody's life is not at stake okay but then i'll say yeah if somebody's going to be a doctor wants to get into medical school 

142.77 157.29 A: and be kind of it like there was a good case a couple of years ago maybe a year ago if you had a certain grade point average and let's say a person really wasn't able creditable to be a doctor but they got in through affirmative action would you want that doctor waiting on you no [mn] 

152.29 153.26 B: (( [noise] right )) 

156.42 158.72 B: no absolutely not 

157.46 160.43 A: see see so it goes both ways 

158.81 159.69 B: (( absolutely )) 

160.32 167.88 B: it goes that's exactly it goes both ways exactly and that's why i have an open mind and it certainly sounds like you do too [laughter] 

162.93 163.74 A: so 

167.06 170.08 A: right i'm ver- very open minded on that right 

169.39 182.04 B: yeah that's right well if you know t- it's a very wide spectrum and i think that depending on the classification of what they are really you know zooming in on really i- is really uh veritable because 

181.96 183.15 A: exactly 

182.10 190.63 B: and when it's going when it comes to e- education that's exactly right i mean and the doctors is is a perfect example i mean i'm stuck in the h._m._o. system and 

190.46 196.55 A: (( oh i can tell you about the the h._m._o. system my wife and i are on h._m._o. system too yeah it's ter- it's terrible )) 

194.39 195.50 B: yeah and i'm 

196.13 207.74 B: yeah my and i'm actually a victim of an h._m._o. and i and i'm not my health i'm not you know i'm not in bad health but the h._m._o. didn't approve a surgery that i needed for over nine years and i had you 

206.54 209.31 A: oh no that's terrible 

207.70 219.26 B: oh yeah i mean and i i need and i've had to have more surgery and i need more surgery in the future and it's because they chose not to address the problem because they were too worried about the money and not the fact of what was wrong 

219.36 221.75 A: exactly exactly 

220.32 227.70 B: you know and its and i always use the example marvin is that it's not whether your leg is broken it's how much it's going to cost to fix and that helps 

226.71 229.98 A: exact it isn't you're right you're absolutely right 

229.34 233.23 B: yeah and that's what h. i call i call h._m._o.s horrible medical organizations 

233.01 240.76 A: [laughter] i wouldn't knock what you say yes and my wife has the same thing too we my wife has the condition she has a really bad stomach problem 

234.98 235.69 B: (( [laughter] )) 

237.50 238.06 B: (( [mn] )) 

240.31 241.29 B: yeah 

240.67 250.49 A: and they they we're in tucson which we have p- pre- pretty decent medical in tucson but it her condition is so bad she can only go to mayo clinic and there's a mayo clinic up in phoenix arizona 

244.73 245.57 B: right 

250.10 251.01 B: right 

250.78 259.22 A: so get approval to go up there one time they approve her then the next time when you go like a year later they say no you can't go up there but they're the ones sent her up there in the first place 

258.63 266.62 B: yeah i see a- and that's absurd an- and that's the thing but the thing is when they go ahead and they ask for the premiums they don't ask you before they take the premiums though 

266.86 272.69 B: you know they go and take the premiums they don't ask you whether whether it's you know approved or not they don't deny that [laughter] 

267.00 268.43 A: exactly right 

271.98 274.64 A: what is your h._m._o. must be kaiser i bet 

274.01 279.44 B: actually no a- actually it wa- it used to be c._i._g._n._a. i- it used to be c._i._g._n._a. but i'm now with 

275.38 276.43 A: (( that's good )) 

278.85 281.10 A: oh c._i._g._n._a. yeah i've heard of that yes 

280.85 291.94 B: yeah cigna's horrible and then i had blue cross and so on so as far as i'm concerned there's not different h._m._o. from from another and and i think when it comes into um 

292.12 296.58 B: of the fact of affirmative action i think affirmative action should be taken 

296.48 310.96 B: regarding health health care because it's health care is absolutely i don't even know how it has made it as far as it has but these doctors are pulling out of the h._m._o. system because they're literally getting paid ten dollars a patient i mean i- 

310.07 324.48 A: that that that's that's right i mean d- w- we- we go- to- all exactly that's what they got to do the doctors don't want to take it and they they see you they see you for like two s- i don't know how it is in los angeles i always complain but like a two sec- a two a two minute visit a two minute visit 

319.00 321.11 B: oh it's hor- it's horrible yeah 

324.50 329.25 B: yeah yes a two minute visit it's kind of like hi okay what brings you here today okay thanks for your time have a good day 

329.26 330.18 B: (( and it's )) 

329.43 333.49 A: and it's the same you probably think that well how much is your premium okay yes you pay a lot every month 

333.46 341.55 B: uh actually i'm be- be- actually my premium is different because i'm on a a senior plan because because of my health yeah 

339.22 340.14 A: yes 

340.94 342.08 A: right 

341.63 350.94 B: so being being with my situation's kind of different as far as the premiums are set up i don't have a monthly premium a- as far as the regular set up through the insurance but 

350.14 354.32 A: yeah whatever you pay whatever whoever's paying for whatever it is it's still a premium 

353.75 357.73 B: oh oh oh exactly right whether it be social security whatever right exactly 

357.13 359.82 A: right they're not for free you're not sitting there for free 

359.45 371.45 B: right it's just the fact is with some of the medications that i'm on that you know they were covered and now they're no longer covered because the h._m._o. has decided on a drug formula that they don't feel like paying for them anymore 

371.33 376.49 B: so that ended up costing me a hundred and fifty dollars more a month than it used to cost me twenty five a month 

375.88 380.90 A: oh that's poor i feel for you i really that's really it's it's sad it's really 

379.29 390.57 B: oh well thank you marvin i feel for your wife because i mean it's just it it there's no excuse for that fact of when you have insurance that's exactly what it should stand for is insurance and that's not what it stands for 

388.84 389.94 A: (( exact- )) 

389.97 401.40 A: i know i ask the lord too uh too we have an older an older vehicle like we should from be- from tucson to to to uh tucson to uh mayo clinic in scottsdale arizona but then a hundred and twenty miles 

393.15 394.00 B: mhm 

401.16 401.90 B: oh 

401.25 405.08 A: and we're on the h._m._o. you know how the h._m._o. wanted to have my wife to get up there 

404.92 405.82 B: oh 

405.72 407.20 A: they want a bus 

407.30 410.56 B: oh that oh that's horrible see each yeah its 

408.86 420.17 A: a bus that would have took twelve hours oh no on the bus i told them leaving five or six hours she's going to have to leave four in the morning and they couldn't even guarantee her that she could make her appointment on time 

411.51 412.59 B: oh that's n- 

419.59 422.08 B: oh that's insane that's absolutely 

421.01 428.88 A: so i said w- i says why can't i have an older car that won't make it up there i says why can't i rent a car i can rent a car for twenty dollars 

428.26 429.57 B: mhm 

429.34 432.46 A: just reimburse me for the car renter they said no 

431.01 445.62 B: yeah exac- exactly exactly and that's why i'm telling you marvin i really feel strongly about this is the fact that if they would have taken care of me in the proper way they put it was they probably would have paid for my surgery a hundred times over already 

445.51 456.94 B: because all they because all they do yeah exactly that's all they do is they just say okay will you do you know i was i was told in the very beginning oh just take two advil and deal with your problem i'm like oh okay 

445.81 446.84 A: (( exac- )) 

456.98 462.87 B: i said that's fine i said you'll take two advil when i get down that's fine and so and so and so basically 

460.68 462.15 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

462.68 473.56 B: i mean my surgeon is out of network i mean all my doctors are now out of network i don't have to deal with with the fact they they have to give me care but you know there's certain things with the h._m._o. system and even the p._p._o.s 

473.36 485.37 B: the health insurance all round with affirmative action i certainly hope politically that they take some action in that way against the way that health care is being run right now because our health is in jeopardy because 

484.64 489.71 A: (( oh oh it is it i- i- i- i- it- it surely is it's it's it's a joke )) 

488.89 493.60 B: it's a joke and it's the gatekeeper that's always involved with the medical group and it's the medical 

492.61 506.49 A: well that's going to i think they only want us to think that we know whenever we go to our primary doctor i'm t- i have not examined you i'm i'm going to make a joke about it i'm i'm a male [laughter] i'm of course i'm a male my doc- i've been with my doctor for three years now he has never gave me an exam 

496.31 497.14 B: right 

500.89 501.65 B: right 

504.36 505.35 B: right 

506.98 508.62 B: oh jeeze really 

508.40 513.05 A: i am serious he has never gave me exam 

512.97 514.97 B: oh that's ri that's ridiculous 

514.52 518.70 A: he he sends me to all these specialists and everything and he's never given me a full exam 

518.78 520.52 A: is that a joke or not 

519.93 522.26 B: that is a joke beyond joke 

522.08 525.51 A: yeah i mean that definitely goes on here so i guess it goes on all over 

525.33 540.16 B: yeah it goes on all over and you know and it's amazing because i actually had to switch an h._m._o. because they wouldn't pay for the medications and now that i've switched the h._m._o. after doing all my homework of making sure the primary care physician is linked to the medical group and the medical group is linked to the health plan 

540.09 545.89 B: got all the correct information and they called me back three days later and tell me that they read it wrong in the computer that my doctor 

545.06 550.29 A: oh i we go though that all the time no she i oh we got this all the time 

547.82 548.93 B: oh yeah 

549.63 559.19 B: oh yeah i've been living this for twelve years marvin and it is absurd and so when they said affirmative action i was like one hundred percent absolutely yes and ed- 

558.45 560.75 A: (( right ex- exactly p- p )) 

559.60 562.82 B: education health issues i mean 

562.61 575.45 B: you know s- uh just all around basic safety all around the country and in many different ways and i mean and that's why i'm hoping that you know i'm glad they do things like this because i have just found out about this this study this type of service thing i 

567.71 568.61 A: (( exactly )) 

574.86 580.11 A: i hope they will i hope they listen to people what they're really saying and and they must have a reason why they do that i hope you know 

579.00 589.46 B: yeah i i think they do and i think they take it very seriously because my friend did it and she told me about it but i didn't is it this the only one that i'm that i'm signed up with because i didn't even know they had something like this 

589.08 599.96 A: yeah my wife told me about it initially because well sometimes they're pretty interesting subjects like this one really got my then there was this one that really got me my own sport and that one they had before that was on the minimum wage 

593.34 594.57 B: (( oh really ))
