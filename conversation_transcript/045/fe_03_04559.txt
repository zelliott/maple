50.43 51.35 B: (( yeah and )) 

50.62 52.82 A: they're like the size of humming birds 

52.19 61.12 B: yeah you like walk out we would walk out and be descended upon by [laughter] mosquitoes [sigh] okay so affirmative action what do you think 

57.22 59.52 A: yeah exactly yes 

60.90 62.33 A: i hate it [sigh] 

61.92 63.58 B: you hate it why do you hate it 

63.37 68.26 A: well let's look at the facts here i'm young i'm white and i'm male and i'm not disabled 

68.26 69.27 B: okay 

68.72 77.65 A: so i'm the opposite of every demographic that affirmative action tries to artificially help in the uh in the workplace 

77.85 79.83 B: okay well 

78.89 80.59 A: do you hear me see what i'm saying 

80.19 81.37 B: yes 

81.53 86.08 B: but do you hate it because of that or do do you hate because of other reasons 

84.14 87.18 A: [cough] well i think it artificially 

87.20 89.45 A: i mean i think everything should be based on merit 

89.32 90.32 B: mhm 

89.53 92.76 A: it should not be based on anything other than merit 

92.92 102.06 A: and to put any other limit on it saying well you have to have so many women or you have to have so many blacks or hispanics you know as percentage just because i think that's erroneous 

102.28 107.99 B: do you think that people in posit- people in the position of hiring people 

108.43 111.45 B: do discriminate do you think that happens 

110.38 117.88 A: well it's not necessarily that they discriminate but there are places where there uh is uh where there are affirmative action especially like in government positions a lot of military stuff 

117.76 118.75 B: mhm 

117.86 126.90 A: where you have they have to say have a class of a hundred people that are going to become colonels or something well they say you have twenty five of those be women 

127.33 134.29 A: even if only say you know uh thirty out a thousand women showed up twenty five of the positions have to go to women just because 

134.22 140.44 B: see i don't like it [sigh] but sometimes i think that it's a necessary evil just because 

140.70 148.00 A: but see it's the same thing you can see about killing off all the jews i mean hitler said that's a necessary evil we got to get this done 'cause you know jews are no good 

146.09 150.94 B: no i think it's totally different [laughter] i mean it's completely different 

149.00 156.44 A: well it's a it's a slippery slope though it's a slippery slope and i think affirmative action had a time uh and a purpose 

157.02 158.45 A: thirty years ago 

158.27 161.08 B: [sigh] well it's so hard to determine like what 

161.38 174.68 B: what should be done and what should not be done but i do think that [sigh] there are people in a position of power that do hiring [sigh] that are racist or sexist or whatever [sigh] and that makes it not fair for some people huh 

170.85 177.02 A: but see that's their that's their right unfortunately but it's their unfortunately it's their right to be idiots 

176.77 182.12 B: [sigh] it's not yeah but that might not be the company's repre- that might not be what the company thinks 

181.24 185.52 A: yeah it might not be what the company's trying to represent but in that case then that person needs 

184.49 188.56 B: and people don't walk around announcing that sort of thing so you don't know it 

187.23 189.44 A: yeah you don't know 

188.33 202.41 B: i mean if they came out and said hey i am this then the company would have a right to say i don't want [sigh] a person who thinks that way [sigh] in a position of power [sigh] so it would be their right not to put that kind of person in a position of power but people unfortunately don't say that 

192.32 192.88 A: (( [cough] )) 

196.69 197.67 A: yeah 

200.05 201.35 A: i agree 

202.24 206.83 A: uh-huh so you so you've got all these bigots running around and you don't know they're bigots 

206.28 208.83 B: you do i think sometimes 

207.98 211.08 A: okay i i can see where you're coming from as far as that goes 

210.36 217.99 B: [sigh] i mean i hate it that it happens i really do i hate it that it's necessary because first of all i think it's insulting to [sigh] i mean the people who 

216.75 221.73 A: to say that women are are can't get ahead unless they're helped along by some rules 

220.97 228.16 B: exactly [sigh] i do think that's insulting because i do think that there are a lot of people [sigh] all different kinds of people that are qualified 

228.02 230.01 A: yes exactly 

229.47 240.00 B: and then sometimes if you get a job because you're a woman or because you're [sigh] a minority people you know are like oh well it's because of affirmative action which might not be the case 

236.44 239.54 A: it's because you're a minority which is what i'm saying 

239.78 240.79 A: yeah 

240.27 243.20 B: and so i mean i do i hate that part of it 

241.51 246.78 A: it takes away the the pride that you would get from receiving the position 

246.81 256.98 B: yes [sigh] i think that there's probably a better way things could be done [sigh] but nobody wants to put the time or effort or creativity into thinking about [sigh] you know maybe there could be 

247.37 248.64 A: sometimes 

257.22 270.54 B: objective measures and it doesn't just con- it doesn't just fall on the shoulders of one person to make that decision because when you have one person making that decision instead of like a set of criteria that have to be met [sigh] then it can be too 

268.47 269.49 A: yeah 

270.34 279.87 B: subjective and you can it can fall into the hands of somebody who's racist or sexist and then [sigh] maybe the most qualified person isn't getting the job because 

279.92 281.42 B: somebody has 

281.59 283.22 B: a biased opinion 

282.10 291.26 A: but see that's also the great thing about capitalism is eventually we'll weed it out and you'll have the best people doing the best things usually not all the time 

288.13 288.69 B: (( [sigh] )) 

290.04 292.17 B: well you hope [sigh] 

291.34 294.57 A: i mean eventually though i mean it is just the nature of the system 

294.55 295.42 B: yes 

295.55 299.37 A: and like except in government jobs but that's a whole different uh a whole different issue 

298.21 305.34 B: no see you would think that government jobs it would be the easiest to to have a set of criteria without 

302.50 306.00 A: to find the right person to do the job to have a set of criteria 

305.50 308.46 B: yeah without just having one person making the decision 

308.57 316.65 A: yeah well with hiring stuff i mean you you if you put enough bureaucracy you put enough paperwork on it i mean it just gets impossible to get anything done 

308.95 310.31 B: you would think that 

316.87 317.72 B: yes 

318.24 318.80 B: (( [sigh] )) 

318.97 321.95 B: but i mean that's like [sigh] i mean 

319.04 320.58 A: (( [lipsmack] uh well )) 

322.23 330.66 B: that's part of [laughter] that's part of what we are i mean we've got and i hate that i hate that about [sigh] our system that it is so 

332.02 337.39 B: there's so many [sigh] it's so gridlocked all the time you know [sigh] because you 

336.30 338.19 A: yeah there's too much red tape 

337.69 349.36 B: yeah it is [sigh] and it's to make both the left and the right happy you have to do all these things and jump through all these ho- hoops you can't just have [sigh] you know because like if you just set something [sigh] 

349.13 363.92 B: no matter what somebody says somebody's going to bitch about it [sigh] if it's something liberal conservatives are going to bitch about it if it's something conservative liberals are going to bitch about it [sigh] and it's got to be changed so that it's somewhere in the middle and that's why you have all this other crap that goes on [sigh] i 

352.72 353.87 A: (( of course )) 

364.14 365.64 B: hate it we're too 

366.25 368.36 B: [sigh] i don't know [sigh] 

367.85 373.10 A: we've got too many people with too many different opinions but you know that's what happens when you're living in the greatest country in the world 

373.05 375.65 B: mm yes i agree but [sigh] 

376.36 381.51 B: i don't know i don't well i don't know that we're the greatest country in the world why would you think that [sigh] 

381.03 389.04 A: well we've got the most money we've got the most oil we've got the most electronics we've got the best uh i mean honestly when it comes down to it our standard of living 

382.55 383.54 B: [sigh] 

385.01 386.21 B: [sigh] 

387.14 388.12 B: (( [sigh] )) 

389.18 399.70 A: uh there are countries with higher standards of living and longer life expectancies but i don't think those occur in the same place and also they're not they don't take place on as larger of a scale as we have managed to accomplish it 

399.46 408.50 B: yeah but don't you think that [mn] whether or not this is the greatest place to live should be based on the happiness of the people who live here rather than monetary things 

407.05 413.84 A: well i think people with with with sewage that gets piped out of their house and hot running water and uh you know 

414.36 418.52 A: entertainment that's available at your fingertips [mn] i i think that's a 

418.57 420.08 A: i think that's important 

419.53 428.68 B: [sigh] well no not those not like third world countries but i mean like places in europe and stuff like that those people those people seem to be pretty happy [sigh] with the way that they live they live too 

422.37 423.35 A: yeah 

424.45 425.48 A: (( mm )) 

426.73 428.28 A: yeah 

428.47 430.96 A: but they're pissed off all the time especially the brits 

430.30 435.40 B: no no i have really good friends who are british they're very happy 

434.04 437.06 A: yeah but see they're happy they're happy because they're over here

439.10 440.80 A: (( oh oh [laughter] )) 

439.86 449.48 B: [laughter] no they're very happy people they're funny they're and they think that they live in the greatest country in the world and i have friends in germany and they think that they live in the greatest country in the world 

442.41 443.33 A: (( what )) 

445.76 447.54 A: (( yeah but we all do [mn] )) 

449.25 451.39 A: yeah well nazis yeah 

450.86 455.67 B: [sigh] they're not nazis [laughter] they're more liberal than we are they're not nazis 

454.53 455.09 A: (( yeah )) 

455.23 457.24 A: (( well the nazis were pretty liberal )) 

456.73 458.93 B: [sigh] no they're not [laughter] 

458.46 461.15 A: i mean i don't think they were republicans 

460.50 461.92 B: [laughter] 

462.34 465.71 A: i think they were democrats for sure 

462.76 463.76 B: (( they're not )) 

465.39 466.39 B: (( nazis )) 

466.78 468.71 B: no why would why 

467.22 468.28 A: yeah 

468.88 473.13 A: well because i don't like liberals i don't like nazis so i think i should group them together 

473.15 476.83 B: [laughter] but that doesn't make sense you don't have any reason to do [laughter] that 

477.12 478.59 A: i said i don't like them 

479.05 480.15 B: well i mean it d- 

479.52 481.50 A: i think yeah 

480.26 484.50 B: it doesn't make sense to group them together you have to base it on what their beliefs are 

485.21 488.24 A: [sigh] well i guess you make a good point [sigh] 

488.29 490.20 A: so about this affirmative action 

489.75 490.75 B: yes 

491.17 495.04 A: i don't like it you don't like it but you think that it might be necessary 

494.59 503.97 B: [sigh] i do yeah i mean i don't i wish that there were a different way it could be done and i do think that there is a different way that it could be done that people just aren't trying hard enough to figure out another way 

503.81 506.80 A: okay but why do we h- have it 

506.47 507.03 B: (( [sigh] )) 

507.20 508.07 B: [sigh] 

508.25 513.89 B: because we do have a lot of racist and sexist people in this country [sigh] and we also have a lot of peop- 

508.54 510.19 A: yeah why do we have to 

512.17 516.31 A: isn't their right though to be racist and sexist i mean i don't i'm not i'm you 

515.66 526.57 B: no i don't think so [sigh] i mean it is but it's not their right [sigh] it is their right to be that but it is not their right to represent a company or a government position with those views 

518.00 520.29 A: don't think people have a right 

525.35 533.49 A: in the in the company or the government position uh i mean they would like i said they need to be removed from that position if they don't represent the goals and the aims of the company 

528.83 529.85 B: [sigh] 

532.96 536.17 B: right but if but people don't speak out about that 

533.74 534.30 A: (( of )) 

536.41 542.22 B: i mean think about the most racist group that there is the klan they hide their faces they don't say who they are 

541.61 545.57 A: course they hid their faces but you can always tell who they are 'cause of their shoes 

543.41 547.21 B: why because they're ashamed they're ashamed of what they represent 

547.22 548.68 A: well yeah 

548.31 562.09 B: i mean it's like and that's the same thing uh like a lot of p- racist people [sigh] they know somewhere in their head that they shouldn't be that way so they don't speak out about it except for people that are really close to them that [sigh] maybe hold the same views 

561.02 562.40 A: and on the internet 

562.29 566.65 B: and on the internet [laughter] which is another way that they don't have to be found out 

566.26 567.61 A: (( yeah exactly [sigh] [sigh] )) 

566.92 577.80 B: [sigh] so i mean [sigh] i don't know i think that there's a better way to do it but also [sigh] there's another thing that i think too i don't think that every person starts out at the same when they go in 

577.56 582.71 B: i don't think everybody gets the same type of education i don't think everybody has the same type of chance 

583.05 584.98 B: to get to the same place 

586.28 591.97 A: [noise] well okay like within individual schools or with individual classrooms or just someone across the country 

586.40 587.32 B: and that's 

591.47 597.74 B: i'm talking about within sc- not well [sigh] okay from school to school okay because of the way 

597.84 599.89 B: schools are funded schools are funded 

597.85 599.89 A: well because it just just because life
