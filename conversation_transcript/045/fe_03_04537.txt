0.12 1.22 A: hello 

0.80 1.99 B: hello 

1.78 2.68 A: hi 

2.53 4.53 B: hi this is brett chambers 

2.72 3.74 A: (( my name's )) 

4.76 9.07 A: hi this is trent uh comes from from uh austin texas 

9.18 11.30 B: oh austin okay 

10.70 13.56 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

12.34 14.37 B: live music capital of the world 

14.50 17.15 A: right exactly how did you know that 

16.56 19.00 B: (( i'm a musician sometimes )) 

17.76 19.04 A: oh yeah okay 

19.11 20.82 B: (( i'm a wannabe musician )) 

20.40 22.18 A: yeah well you know 

22.25 27.26 A: eventually you become a musician sometimes you know when uh [sigh] so uh what do you think 

26.45 32.71 B: uh well um [lipsmack] that's one of those uh touchy subjects i guess 

31.71 33.80 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

32.78 40.20 B: i think to some extent there's always some kind of affirmative action going on regardless of which side of the aisle you're on 

40.43 41.64 B: um 

40.48 41.99 A: yeah 

42.15 51.09 B: if you're in industry business and industry you're always there's there's always a need for some type of balance and diversity because i think 

51.14 56.28 B: affirmative action and diversity are two different they're two different issues that are 

56.55 58.35 B: tied closely together 

58.46 60.37 A: (( [noise] mhm yeah )) 

58.60 61.33 B: but people kind of draw them both together 

61.77 63.87 A: yeah 

62.45 63.89 B: yeah so 

63.96 73.58 B: 'cause like the michigan case where they say oh um this decides whether affirmative action should still happen or not 

73.11 74.14 A: yeah 

73.70 78.58 B: to me michigan had a flawed system of delivery of affirmative action 

78.17 80.33 A: yeah 

78.95 84.89 B: you know just to give people twenty points that's like a system set up waiting for a court challenge 

85.04 92.28 A: yeah i i heard tha- i don't know if this is right but i heard that you only got like you got less points for having a perfect s. a. t. 

93.15 96.18 A: you know i think i got that from a comic strip so i don't know how accurate it is 

96.22 106.00 A: but you know but i think there should be additional points given maybe but not not more than you get for a perfect s. a. t. i mean that's 

105.93 110.32 B: well [noise] see one of the things um hold on a second 

111.10 112.25 B: um 

113.37 122.00 B: one of the issues is that you know one of you know everybody has a different relevant standard of what makes up the population that they want 

121.81 123.01 A: yeah 

122.40 131.25 B: you know yeah everybody wants a a four pointers well actually that's the thing not everybody wants a four point oh student with sixteen hundred s. a. t.'s 

128.80 130.59 A: mhm 

130.94 133.21 A: yeah 

131.75 134.95 B: you know they want a certain group of them 

134.56 136.11 A: yeah 

135.14 141.58 B: but a lot of the especially the bigger schools they realise that in order to have a certain 

141.67 145.36 B: type of environment they want to create 

143.31 144.22 A: mhm 

145.64 147.18 B: a certain 

147.43 153.52 B: atmosphere for students to learn about different people they want to have quote unquote diversity 

150.65 152.54 A: yeah 

153.39 156.13 A: i think there is a benefit to that to have 

156.40 161.80 A: you know i went to um an elementary school but i went to a private elementary school there were 

161.84 165.29 A: like there was one black kid in our class there was one 

165.52 170.79 A: one hispanic person and this is texas so one hispanic person that's quite impressive you know just to have only one 

170.55 171.65 B: right 

171.07 181.47 A: and uh it was it was definitely a different experience to go to a public school where there is you know every everybody's there i mean there's just all different people it was you know a real shock 

181.77 184.31 A: um so it probably is you know 

184.59 186.31 A: good at least in college to 

186.36 192.75 A: get some kind of diversity dealing with different kind of people but i don't know i guess i'm just kind of just kind of feel like uh 

192.86 200.78 A: you know you [sigh] university isn't just really for education you know college is really for education i don't think 

201.00 202.78 A: you know and uh 

202.94 209.84 A: i don't that eliminates people i think that a lot of i- i'm sure you know plenty of people from all 

209.90 220.03 A: backgrounds can get into a college but then again i don't know i mean i'm you know i'm twenty three white male so it's like [mn] you know i really can't even talk about it 'cause i don't i don't know 

220.08 222.44 A: what it's like for other people you know 

222.32 223.43 B: mhm 

222.71 228.48 A: so i kind of feel like you know when when [laughter] people bring up affirmative i'm like uh i don't know 

228.49 230.50 B: are you are you in college now 

228.75 229.37 A: (( i )) 

229.86 234.16 A: yeah i'm in college now i uh it's a community college 

231.27 232.37 B: oh where 

233.91 234.92 B: okay 

234.99 236.00 A: and uh 

234.99 239.41 B: yeah a- and the community college make up is different than if you were at u. t. austin 

239.07 244.06 A: yeah oh yeah because i mean well you know we get we get a lot of uh 

245.48 250.35 A: there there's a good spread of people there more than i thought would be 

250.71 255.45 A: um we get a lot of a lot of a lot of students from out of the country 

255.79 256.77 B: mhm 

255.81 259.92 A: like uh we got a an ethiopian we had someone from um 

261.59 270.91 A: [lipsmack] uh not not greece but the country right next to it i c- i can't remember what it's called now but you know so so got that but um 

265.23 266.19 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

272.12 276.00 A: well it was nowhere near what u. t. would have i'm sure 

274.99 286.34 B: right yeah so i mean so it's a different mix and the whole like in a business setting i've had to work in an indus- i used to work in television and 

276.67 278.35 A: but 

282.24 284.05 A: mhm 

286.24 288.10 A: (( yeah )) 

286.62 293.28 B: one of the jobs i had was overseeing our fair labor practices and our diversity issue 

293.14 295.12 A: yeah 

293.66 298.41 B: and we didn't have to give like a whole lot of special weight to 

298.85 301.30 B: to attract minorities 

301.05 302.85 A: mhm 

301.38 311.16 B: it's being it's like because the fact is news like back then like news directors gave more weight to women with big breasts 

310.94 314.11 A: yeah [noise] yeah [laughter] 

311.51 312.82 B: you know what i'm saying 

312.89 316.78 B: or they gave weight to blondes or 

316.63 318.53 A: yeah 

317.05 324.70 B: um or if the news director of course being male maybe had a thing for redheads 

324.49 326.32 A: yeah 

324.96 336.14 B: but everybody has a preference but the smart ones would always balance that out with well you know i can't hire a whole bunch of blondes because then my my my my 

336.34 339.21 B: news team looks p- pretty homogeneous 

338.96 340.88 A: yeah 

339.39 343.78 B: they have a certain mix so i can have a couple of uh 

341.79 343.53 A: (( yeah )) 

343.91 352.13 B: redheads and couple of blondes a couple of brunettes um you know women that don't all protrude across the the news desk 

351.68 353.12 A: (( yeah )) 

352.17 354.38 B: [laughter] um 

353.41 356.24 A: [laughter] 

354.45 360.62 B: yeah uh but you know i'm kind of like exaggerating only a little bit though believe it or not uh 

359.18 365.47 A: yeah well it is t._v. so you want to get that viewership 

363.04 369.51 B: yeah but but the but the consideration there is they they do con- they take looks under consideration 

368.90 371.12 A: yeah 

369.65 377.15 B: and so even when they consider someone that was like black or hispanic there was a certain look that that person had to have 

376.79 378.98 A: yeah 

377.51 388.45 B: and so when uh back you know when i backed it out and look at okay affirmative action there's always like i said that's where to me affirmative action and diversity 

387.98 388.80 A: (( mm )) 

388.50 391.96 B: are linked but they're two different issues 

391.61 393.58 A: yeah 

392.13 400.17 B: and so often to me in the discussion people press them together as if they're the one and the same and they're not 

399.98 401.95 A: yeah 

400.64 408.49 B: and so like in a business environment affirmative action there's always some com- there's always some type of affirmative action 

408.51 418.61 B: if they look around and say oops you know we've been hiring the same company to do the same job for so long maybe it's time for us to look at another company that's affirmative action 

416.79 417.61 A: mhm 

418.31 420.00 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

419.58 422.85 B: you know now should the company be penalized 

423.49 426.91 B: in that the fact that they think in terms of it or should they 

427.44 433.47 B: you know get help and assistance in developing a system that's not discriminatory quote unquote 

433.48 436.41 A: (( yeah [cough] yeah )) 

433.92 442.78 B: to to address the the the way they're going to deploy that and 'cause the end result is after they decide they need it is to add diversity 

442.39 444.59 A: mhm 

443.57 451.66 B: i mean that's kind of what happens if affirmative action is a mechanism to a- to address some diversity issues 

451.60 454.14 A: (( yeah my i don't know )) 

452.61 455.38 B: so i mean that's just the way i look at it 

455.37 463.90 A: i can see your point yeah but i guess i think i think you're trying to define it as you know i think most people when they think of affirmative action 

464.04 477.44 A: think you know mainly because of how um you know politicians are trying you know a lot of the politicians have been trying to say that it's you know it's just getting minorities an upper hand and it's not fair i think you're just trying to define it as something 

477.50 480.08 A: just any kind of 

479.53 484.13 B: [noise] it's a much wider it's a much broader s- issue um 

482.89 486.50 A: [mn] yeah i think that's really true 

484.47 485.76 B: like uh 

486.05 491.86 B: like affirmative action uh halliburton got the contract to rebuild our rec 

492.18 494.23 A: yeah 

492.74 496.87 B: and halliburton is the former company headed by 

497.61 498.50 B: chaney [laughter] 

498.79 501.03 A: i think i think so 

500.72 509.35 B: you know i'm now was i don't know that wasn't affirmative action if if you ask me i mean that was preferential treatment 

506.17 508.18 A: yeah 

508.95 510.18 A: exactly 

509.88 510.83 B: (( you know )) 

510.29 516.08 A: but it was you know preferen- preferential treatment to a person who is you know in control [laughter] 

516.11 518.25 A: has lots of money and power 

517.11 519.02 B: they say that's politics though 

518.57 524.22 A: so they're not going to complain about that that's not going to be you know [laughter] brought up but uh 

521.22 522.84 B: right 

524.60 525.53 A: (( you know )) 

527.11 529.82 B: (( it's like welfare um )) 

527.23 529.30 A: i'm sure that 

529.85 534.45 B: one of the biggest con- uh recipients of welfare is a- a. d. m. 

534.44 536.27 A: yeah 

534.84 540.99 B: archer daniels midland they get corporate welfare all the time is called federal sub- subsidies 

536.59 538.47 A: mhm 

540.72 543.12 A: oh yeah they get more than anyone [noise] 

541.29 553.32 B: all for wheat and corn and to send food over here send food over there stop making so much of this because we have a surplus or you know they get paid sometimes not to produce food 

552.75 555.40 A: (( yeah this uh this uh )) 

553.78 554.75 B: so 

554.90 558.01 B: that's welfare they get paid not to work 

556.76 560.67 A: oh yeah and they get paid way more than uh 

561.03 568.40 A: you know some some woman with three kids is going to get you know and and uh but they won't complain about that because you know they 

563.84 564.86 B: right 

568.47 569.37 B: right 

568.63 576.99 A: they have the politicians in their pocket so they get away with it i mean it's not it's that that's totally unfair you know to to pick on 

577.38 587.20 A: you know to pick on somebody that's just trying to help themselves out and not even pay attention to a company i mean it's a company they should be making money that's what they're that's all they're there for is is to 

587.00 588.77 B: yeah their profit centre 

587.58 594.59 A: be profitable if they're not profitable then they're not really a company you know it's just [laughter] like an organisation yeah 

591.98 598.59 B: yeah and if they're not profitable they're there are ways that they deal with that too because sometimes companies are not profitable and they go on doing it 

598.52 599.95 A: yeah 

598.97 599.89 B: (( and that m- ))
