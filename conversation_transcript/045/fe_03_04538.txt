161.86 164.83 B: they don't go mess with nobody that's decent that's decent

164.89 166.42 A: yeah but they they get mhm 

169.60 173.36 B: [noise] the people you know give them a little break or something 

173.45 178.54 B: the guy from the new york times they gave him affirmative action and he start lying start making up stories 

178.59 179.75 A: yeah 

179.42 180.63 B: in the paper 

180.43 182.10 A: yeah 

181.44 182.95 B: (( most of the time )) 

183.09 184.10 A: (( um )) 

184.51 190.40 A: i i didn't read it so it's difficult for uh me to say but i don't see anything wrong with er with that 

189.33 193.50 B: well they say he was lying in the newspaper they say he start making up stories 

193.15 207.24 A: well lying it's pa- uh what have i to say when you read pa- uh er newspaper or y- it not really objective okay they manip- manipulate you so it's better for you to read as you know to read the to read books 

204.35 208.51 B: right 'cause how are you going to believe everything you read in the newspaper anyway you know 

207.65 213.37 A: yeah i mean and it's why i don't read newspaper because i know that the truth is somewhere between the lines 

213.02 215.46 B: i watch the news you ever watch the news on t._v. 

215.23 220.76 A: i do watch not too much my er my wife watch more of the news because 

219.76 221.39 B: she watch more 

220.77 226.02 A: yeah because she thinks er news will change her life somehow but i don't i don't believe that 

223.98 227.88 B: tell her tell her to watch the b._b._c. the b._b._c. have good news 

227.87 230.23 A: yes b._b._c.'s different i agree with that 

229.08 239.56 B: b._b._c. is all right you don't know what's up with the a._b._c. and the n._b._c. you know they make up shit but the b._b._c. is good but i think affirmative action is all right but i think it they take a little too too much 

239.64 249.82 A: yeah maybe like again i i don't know enough about it to really go deep with it but uh it's something we need in a democracy that's for sure 

249.50 253.48 B: right right it helps the little people right it helps the little people 

249.95 251.91 A: but if er that's too much 

253.22 257.23 A: yeah maybe it's too much i don't know that um but er 

255.38 261.03 B: right i i think it should help the little people a little bit but not too much you know what i mean [noise] 

260.31 263.42 A: yeah what what i like to say here it's uh 

263.68 273.74 A: unfortunately well okay w live in a in a democracy and everybody else have a right to you know to to express their opinions why it is wonderful to live in uh in united states 

273.84 275.26 A: but um 

275.46 277.35 A: uh 

277.41 290.36 A: yeah er the news are misleading you for example when you have er when you have er an earthquake okay and you will see only if a building falling right you don't see the building when it doesn't fall because it is not interesting 

284.53 285.39 B: mhm 

290.18 300.60 A: bad new is entertainment and therefore you will have probably more minority things on t._v. because it's what people are w- are waiting for 

292.10 293.36 B: right right 

298.28 299.15 B: [noise] 

300.84 310.71 A: they want to see drama okay and the good things in the news are very very limited so uh what i do say is why it is depressing sometime to watch the news 

300.85 301.58 B: (( mm )) 

302.33 303.06 B: (( [noise] )) 

304.34 305.38 B: [noise] 

310.86 312.29 A: but um 

312.37 318.42 A: if not it is very difficult you know to judge one way or another because it is not objective 

318.57 319.37 A: so 

318.90 320.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

319.48 324.34 A: i don't know what to tell you else except that uh within minority uh discussion 

324.39 337.39 A: and er i feel affirmative action probably but uh is it is it too much or not maybe you are right but in order to know if it is too much you have to not to look at the news but i to read books about it you know and then you will have a better 

337.44 339.56 A: overall picture of what's going on 

339.27 344.94 B: right i think you should have a little bit of minority little bit of little bit affirm- affirmative action is too much 

345.40 351.13 A: probably but again i'm not quite sure about it but probably you are right yeah 

349.29 362.49 B: right so you're not you're not right up on them but i think affirmative action is too much i mean you want to help everybody and you want to help the people that don't have a chance but come on now give us a break goddamn there's too much 

356.31 357.12 A: yeah 

362.61 367.96 A: well again it depends where you are i mean if you were in the minority uh group uh 

367.56 370.23 B: (( i'm in a minority group i'm black i'm black )) 

369.69 372.72 A: oh okay so yeah all right so you are [laughter] 

371.52 376.39 B: i'm in a minority group but i still think it's a little too much they're go- they're going to go too far 

376.10 382.19 A: yeah yeah it's like it's like uh you know when something b- like the war in in iraq for example 

381.69 382.47 B: (( mhm )) 

382.43 395.81 A: uh okay we got the picture but when it's had it in every channel what this will will bring you er the opposite we need to to relax a little you know now not to be because to be depressed doesn't help you know what i mean 

394.62 396.64 B: right that don't help that don't help 

396.45 409.05 A: so uh to see too much of bad stuff does you know because in reality when when y- when you live a regular life if you don't know what's going on in the war you need to know but 

408.48 409.64 B: right 

409.03 414.89 A: uh er did your life did your life change because you have a war in i- iraq probably not you still 

409.97 410.96 B: but see the 

413.45 417.81 B: the the guy from new york he made up all the shit he made up shit 

417.38 418.71 A: yeah yeah 

417.85 430.32 B: he just guessed and they say he only got a job 'cause he was black and i think it's okay that he got his job 'cause he was black but just 'cause he make up dumb shit that don't mean all black people make up shit 

421.88 422.88 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

430.35 431.61 B: you know what i mean 

430.54 438.70 A: (( well you know i really believe that you have good and bad people period it has nothing to do with co- skin color or ethnic group or or )) 

437.61 443.02 B: man i'm going to switzerland i'm going to switzerland 'cause they don't fight with nobody 

439.81 440.62 A: what 

442.76 454.54 A: that's true that's true but uh er well actually you know it's funny because in switzerland er they are very honest but in reality what we are doing we follow authority blindly 

454.51 455.45 B: (( okay )) 

454.93 468.82 A: they'll be out a mi- they will not steal because the government will say that stealing is bad but if the government will say that stealing is kind of okay they will steal what i'd [laughter] like to say they are honest because they are sheep they just follow okay 

466.55 470.82 B: right don't have all that all that trouble and all them fighting and stuff 

470.18 475.44 A: yeah but switzerland is a peaceful country i mean we don't have all the problem we have here but uh i protes- 

473.66 480.80 B: [noise] they seem very nice because they never had no war right never had no war and never fight with nobody you know uh 

477.15 477.97 A: no 

479.99 480.72 A: no 

480.95 483.03 B: every man for themselves and shit 

482.72 488.96 A: well you have things under the table that you don't know okay during the war and things like that but we let we let uh we let uh 

489.21 502.26 A: people like uh you know eclair or follower passing through and things like this because we wanted to keep our neutrality you have a lot of dark stuff uh that people don't know about switzerland but uh in general yeah it's a neutral country we not 

489.24 490.10 B: [noise] 

497.61 498.47 B: [noise] 

501.42 502.82 B: right 

502.38 512.18 A: but when you talk about the people they are all against america sometime i mean against americans they're not supposed to be against americans if we are neutral you know [laughter] 

505.87 507.37 B: (( there's a )) 

507.91 509.54 B: lot americans over there they 

511.48 513.97 B: don't get no affirmative action over there do they 

513.73 515.97 A: (( uh no uh even if )) 

514.70 517.41 B: no and you've no affirmative action in switz- switzerland 

516.74 524.20 A: no it's you know it's a rich country i mean when i say rich country means that you don't see people on the street you know like uh homeless 

524.20 531.90 A: uh because if you are on the street they put you in jail on the um they let because it's dirty to be on the street you know they want to keep the image 

526.63 527.92 B: (( get outta here )) 

529.75 533.11 B: uh-hum that's not good that's not good 

532.43 541.90 A: so we put people in jail and the lex- next morning you are free again but we will not let you sleep on the street so you see the image but you don't see the real- 

538.85 540.13 B: (( good on you )) 

542.03 544.20 A: (( reality behind it is what i reckon )) 

543.21 545.51 B: but they put you in jail 

544.93 551.04 A: yeah they put you in jail not like you are a criminal but they don't want to uh they it's probably bad basically to sleep on the street 

550.41 552.20 B: they don't want you on the street 

551.84 557.60 A: yeah you can you can't be homeless in switzerland they find you a place to sleep which is good in some way but uh 

557.87 567.86 A: again it's very hypocrite [laughter] because uh they have poor people in switzerland also but especially because the cost of living in switzerland is very very high 

560.45 561.63 B: (( all right )) 

568.25 572.17 A: you your salary is high too but uh i'm richer here 

572.26 578.30 A: (( i can buy a car you know in switzerland all used car are al- almost brand new so )) 

575.58 576.51 B: right 

578.56 581.48 A: you know i will i will have more chance uh to 

581.34 593.63 A: to have a house in united states that i have in in my own country even if i earn like a minimum wage of maybe uh three thousand five hundred dollars a month uh and it was like ten years ago so probably higher today 

585.86 586.79 B: (( mm )) 

593.72 599.89 A: so it's a lot of money a- as a salary but if you live there you spend a lot of money too so uh [laughter] you can econ- 

598.75 599.95 B: that's a lot of money
