0.46 2.01 A: hey there it's mike 

1.64 3.76 B: oh my name is mike too 

3.69 6.19 A: yay we got two mikes good 

5.42 6.98 B: where are you calling from 

6.94 11.61 A: um well i'm not calling they called me but i'm in uh uh in chino california 

11.97 14.80 B: in ch- oh okay i'm in uh ventura 

14.97 16.73 A: well then you're not terribly far 

16.43 22.17 B: no i mean i t- i talked to two other people the past two days and they've all been in california 

21.66 24.57 A: yeah i wander if they go outside the state i'd be curious 

24.40 25.69 B: (( mhm )) 

25.55 26.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

26.53 27.57 A: it's interesting 

26.55 29.82 B: (( uh so um )) 

28.22 31.16 A: the topic is affirmative action yeah 

30.58 32.27 B: right [sigh] 

32.01 38.50 A: and uh and what's your opinion you think that it it works it uh it has any uh validity or any value 

38.52 44.27 B: uh i don't know um i work for the government and they they do that e._e._o. and um 

38.92 39.49 A: (( [noise] )) 

45.25 54.96 B: they uh all of a sudden i guess uh affirmative action was supposed to help m- uh black males get jobs then all of a sudden they made everybody qualify for it 

55.10 65.99 B: you know every nationality every woman every everything like that you know so at my work when they want to fill a quota like that they hire women so they just hire more women 

60.09 61.02 A: yeah 

65.06 67.43 A: uh i see i see 

66.19 68.84 B: they don't diversify in any other direction so [mn] 

68.89 76.40 A: yeah that's interesting uh i wonder how it works whether it's of any value in colleges i think that's where it's concerned 

76.34 79.89 A: to make room for of course those kids who are underprivileged or 

79.83 91.52 A: from the lower echelons uh to get into college but i- i- in doing so precludes kids that maybe uh more viable for that college who got better grades in their s._a._t.s et cetera 

92.14 94.88 A: see in one way you are discriminating 

95.33 101.25 A: i think the concept is well there's been so many years of discrimination that it's time to uh 

101.80 112.51 A: uh [sigh] to to even the the playing field but unfortunately even evening the playing field in that way what you do is you wind up discriminating kids who do have uh 

112.47 124.16 A: the ability and the talent uh for a particular college and uh in favor of somebody who who uh needs to get in a- and can't afford it or is not even up to it academically but only because of the color of their skin 

124.98 126.95 A: i'm not sure it's the best idea 

128.17 131.35 B: so you're saying it might not be all that good of a deal 

130.91 136.19 A: i don't think it's that great a deal the way it is yeah yeah yeah i don't think that 

132.17 134.64 B: i agree with you i agree with you 

134.94 144.14 B: you know because if a person goes to college they always apply to more than one and then that application where you tell about yourself like your character and stuff that's 

139.09 139.95 A: right 

144.52 150.68 B: so if you're going regardless of what your college you're going on student loans or someone's paying your way or whatever i mean 

150.78 154.24 B: you go to a college you can afford that will accept you you 

152.45 153.68 A: (( [noise] right )) 

154.21 157.08 A: yeah well that's the point i- if indeed you are 

157.18 165.45 A: you are a student and you don't have the grades for whatever reason i mean listen life isn't fair it's as simple as that life is not fair and that's how life is 

165.54 174.14 A: and uh uh i- if indeed you're going to go to a college and and you you're not prepared you don't have the grades to go to uh 

174.22 188.99 A: uh brandeis or or uh stanford or something uh and you do have the grades to go to a community college well then you have to make the best do that you can do in the community college and not knock somebody out of stanford just 'cause you want to go there and you have the ability to go there because you're black or you're 

189.01 195.05 A: a color that's uh uh which is the the which is the color of the day i don't think that's the way to do it 

193.09 193.96 B: (( know well )) 

194.95 205.05 B: that's how a friend of mine back doored his was into berkley he went to the uh the local uh community college and they had a program that goes into there and that 

201.87 202.72 A: right 

204.25 205.45 A: of course 

205.11 206.93 B: and that's how he did it so 

206.41 212.58 A: well that's the point anybody can get into community college as a general rule so and it seems to me that college 

212.70 214.91 A: is what you make of it so 

214.71 229.54 A: i don't know in terms of work but at least in terms of college i think that that uh that kind of affirmative action should not be applied in any way shape or form and it is unfortunately in terms of work hard to say i think what you want to do is have somebody as a 

229.53 230.57 A: businessperson 

230.74 244.54 A: uh hire the best person for the job i you know i i i'm i'm i have mixed feelings about making it easy for somebody because of color [noise] or because of uh uh because of status 

231.74 232.45 B: (( [mn] )) 

244.90 248.96 A: i i think it i think i- it imposes upon uh 

249.01 257.08 A: nature's uh ability to to get us to where we're going to go because of our own uh instincts and individual uh talents 

257.70 264.24 B: y- y- you know when you say hire people for whatever their nationality or their gender or whatever um 

263.27 264.46 A: (( right [noise] )) 

264.07 275.46 B: when i go for a job you know i tell them right out you know i go um well in th- they're feeling me out in an interview and i'm telling them you know i tell them at the end you know even before the end i go uh 

275.30 284.24 B: you know if things don't work out you know we just shake hands and i go on my way and that's it and all the time they say okay when can you start 

284.29 291.17 B: 'cause that'll let them know like you know i'm your guy this is a business you're trying to make money here i understand the philosophy behind that 

291.02 299.63 B: and if i'm not good for your company if i can't work if i don't work out if i'm not making money for you then i can easily see you letting me go and i accept that 

299.93 307.68 B: so i mean regardless of who if you hire somebody for whatever reason they can't cut the mustard you got to cut them loose i think that's 

306.56 310.72 A: yeah you got to cut them lose but see the problem is you if you hire somebody 

308.12 308.96 B: but the 

311.07 312.68 A: and you cut them loose 

312.66 313.98 B: then they fight it 

314.17 315.53 B: that's the problem 

314.26 322.65 A: and they fight it and they fight it on the on the grounds that you're cutting them loose because of color or uh or uh or sex [mn] 

321.94 323.07 B: right 

323.18 331.91 B: that's why like i said i tell them right up front hey if i don't wo- if i'm not your cup of tea we just shake hands and part ways and that's it and they have no problem with that 

325.70 326.44 A: uh 

328.48 331.04 A: yeah and they're not gonna do that 

331.57 340.39 A: you know the average person the average person may not do that or or certainly someone whether it's a woman or someone who's hispanic or black or whatever or asian 

340.60 347.08 A: that wants that position and may not be qualified and then the the the uh the uh 

346.56 347.65 B: exactly 

346.97 356.72 A: business is imposed to hire them because of affirmative action i you know it's to me it's like if i owned an apartment house which is it's sort of in the same line [lipsmack] 

357.00 359.86 A: and the government said i had to rent 

360.00 368.27 A: to somebody because of their color or because of their sex or because of the fact that they had kids i would say you can't tell me that you don't pay my taxes 

368.36 375.81 B: no if they if you were in a subsidized program from them i could see they say that yeah but if you run your own thing if 

372.32 373.20 A: different 

373.30 376.95 A: different thing if they offered to pay for it yeah yeah that's right 

376.35 381.02 B: if that's your own property your own deal then they should have no say in it whatsoever 

380.33 390.81 A: that's right and they do have a say unfortunately and then they say you you have to allow people if they have kids well i mean where are these people with kids going to go they'll go to a place that takes kids 

391.68 393.02 B: who's paid the 

392.03 394.14 A: not my place yeah 

393.46 397.13 B: who's done that the liberals have passed that stuff they they're the ones that 

396.11 398.56 A: yeah and the funny thing is i'm liberal 

398.33 407.40 A: and that's funny i don't go in that direction i'm liberal but i don't go in that direction i just don't think that you can impose upon someone's private life and tell them in business 

407.34 418.64 A: who they can and who they cannot hire or who they can and who they cannot have rent their apartment i just don't believe in it i also believe that if somebody is is uh trashing your apartments one of your apartments that you own 

418.41 433.12 A: that you should be able to kick their frigging arse out and not have somebody intercede like the a._c._l._u. and say well you know they have uh they have rights to stay there and you these people have to stay in whoever it is then it that case that isn't going to make any difference from what uh strata they come from 

421.34 422.51 B: [mn] 

431.15 445.04 B: see i i totally agree with everything you're saying and that's uh and american way of thought you know if you were french we go oh if they don't pay that's okay you know all right you know what i'm s- not just say [laughter] the way they're dogging the french but 

434.40 435.26 A: yeah 

436.62 437.65 A: yeah 

440.79 441.41 A: (( yeah )) 

442.87 443.93 A: yeah 

444.33 454.05 A: i'm into it in terms of capitalism i mean it is it certainly capitalism and listen i contribute to charities and i do things for charities because i believe that that it's 

447.08 447.96 B: right 

454.13 467.68 A: personally me i wouldn't want to impose on anybody else but it's my way of saying okay let me see if i can help uh level the playing field for people in terms of organizations that help but i don't want anybody i don't want an imposition i don't want a government agency 

468.08 476.59 A: whether it's uh local or whether it's federal telling me that i have to employ somebody or allow somebody to live in one of my buildings if i choose not to 

477.16 483.88 A: and i i just find that uh uh b- actually i find it unconscionable i mean 'cause they don't pay you know what it is it's just like federal government that says 

483.89 485.37 A: (( uh uh [mn] )) 

485.58 487.05 A: that you have to 

487.72 493.86 A: facilitate the uh uh the people that come from other countries uh aliens from other countries whether it's mexico or wherever 

493.64 495.83 A: you have to facilitate them and support them 

495.79 509.12 A: and you have to give them uh a certain amount of uh uh support system and financially yeah but the government doesn't pay you for that in california we have the highest rate of that because we're right next to the border but the government doesn't support us 

510.25 520.27 A: the federal government doesn't support you doesn't say okay we'll provide you this kind of money for medical uh stipends for p- people who are crossing over the border that wind up coming to your country 

520.32 534.36 A: they don't support you but they demand that you that you don't uh export them and get rid of them and kick them out and i you know i'm i'd want to be as good as the next person but as far as i'm concerned the law's the law it's if it's illegal it should be illegal it should be illegal for everybody 

534.33 538.72 A: come here if you sign your papers and you're here legally and that's okay 

539.53 542.25 A: and that's fine and that's that's the way it should be done 

542.51 551.68 A: unless of course you're escaping some real god awful tyranny uh and then you know you want to help somebody but i i don't know i don't like this imposition by government it doesn't thrill me at all 

551.73 565.16 B: [mn] my cousin used to work at the hospital down in chula vista you know and that's like six miles to the in tijuana and all kinds of people that come across the border they uh all the time you know 

557.86 559.56 A: yeah 

559.60 560.73 A: right 

564.56 566.31 A: yeah that's right 

565.72 570.87 B: border patrol in there carting them in carting them out when they're hurt and taking them back or whatever 

569.52 580.70 A: it's it's very very hard and it's terrible on them because we know what they're trying to escape they're trying to escape their economics listen if you want to support a country economically well then i think we should support our neighbour mexico 

580.69 585.36 A: and support them economically so that the people that live there will have a reason to stay there 

582.78 584.26 B: (( mm )) 

585.61 591.10 B: sure but they're so their culture's so old and em- embedded in uh uh corruption 

589.32 590.31 A: i know 

590.96 592.30 A: mhm [noise] 

591.52 593.01 B: it's unreal 

592.81 598.37 A: well since fox took over it's getting better but it won't get better faster yeah yeah 

596.72 599.90 B: well they the uh well before nine eleven bush and fox
