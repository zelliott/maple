65.32 66.81 B: it's a lot cheaper 

67.01 70.66 B: i mean you know because with college the only thing you're really paying for 

70.77 75.84 B: and i mean is the fact that you're paying a big tuition because they're not getting any aid with it you know what i'm saying 

75.66 83.50 A: yeah but i think i think like with um like pre college you get better prep with a private school though

141.73 145.02 B: private schools don't pay their teachers as well you realize that 

144.88 153.81 A: [noise] [noise] actually i didn't know about that i thought i thought they would have ah like you know the the prices reflect the pay and that they're also getting 

146.81 147.99 B: yeah 

149.19 150.04 B: (( no )) 

152.01 159.73 B: no no no not at all you got to understand something public schools are funded by tax dollars private schools are not 

159.17 160.82 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

160.54 162.52 B: so that's what you're really paying for 

162.31 164.39 A: so where does the money go then 

162.80 163.53 B: (( and and )) 

164.63 166.02 A: like for private 

164.79 171.21 B: well well for private that th- [mn] that's what i say the private goes to the owner you know the owner 

171.02 179.90 B: it's a business he sets up a business and he's got to pay teachers and he doesn't get any aid the way he would he doesn't get any government help a public school gets government help 

179.32 182.32 A: [noise] yeah i didn't know about that [noise] [noise] 

180.78 188.37 B: yeah and another thing right and another thing i i don't know if you know this or not believe it or not in the pr- the public schools pay more 

188.72 190.29 B: give better benefits 

190.31 197.11 B: and um you know the teachers that that can't pass the test for public schools work at the private schools 

197.07 198.72 A: mhm 

198.08 207.80 B: it's true it's hard to believe so you're really getting you're paying more and you get but you know on the other hand what you're getting is i guess some 

207.89 211.50 B: i guess you're round richer people [laughter] you know 

210.79 216.80 A: can you hold on for a sec i need to get a phone call i'll just be like half a second thanks

233.47 235.35 A: sorry about that 

234.40 247.94 B: yeah it's okay yeah anyway well my sister has kids my sister's kids went to private school a lot of parents don't like to send their kids to the public schools i'll tell you what else is wrong with the public schools the public schools don't pay as much attention to attendance 

247.99 248.96 A: [noise] oh 

249.35 254.43 A: yeah that that's i i can find that sure i mean like just from experience but [noise] [noise] 

253.95 263.21 B: yeah yeah because at public school um you could you you could be out for um [mn] 

264.30 269.27 B: in public school you you could be you you could be out of school a month before your parents find out you know 

268.20 274.97 A: it's interesting i heard like with attendance though it's more like micro managed like 

275.12 281.47 A: the school um gets like a per head do you know anything about that or so 

280.58 285.70 B: no i didn't know oh yeah yeah yeah it's something yeah i forgot how that works yeah you're right 

284.57 290.81 A: they they are kind of like watching out on attendance because otherwise it's it's like they lose money 

288.03 289.25 B: yeah 

292.28 293.46 B: well 

293.60 294.59 B: (( ah )) 

294.73 297.89 B: (( yeah but yeah but there's there's ah )) 

298.14 300.88 B: there's ah ways around it you know 

300.81 301.73 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

301.73 309.47 B: i mean the b- b- bigger the future i think the attendance is taken in home room you know so a lot of people show up for home room and they cut out for the other ones you know 

309.35 311.07 A: yeah 

310.15 315.76 B: yeah so basically they they're not sure that you're there for the day if you go to home room so i 

314.45 317.69 A: are you are you involved in that industry or are you um 

317.88 318.88 B: (( mean no )) 

319.17 322.24 B: no i work um i'm an engineer so um
