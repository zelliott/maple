0.24 2.00 A: hi my name is dan 

1.95 5.85 B: hi this is kathy um where are you calling from 

6.09 7.85 A: philadelphia where are you 

7.48 15.33 B: uh cleveland so are you in [laughter] don't laugh about jim thome [laughter] are you um 

9.57 10.45 A: (( okay )) 

14.52 18.47 A: i love yeah jim thome's a great guy i'm glad we got him 

16.44 17.61 B: yeah 

17.72 18.81 B: right 

18.90 20.90 B: um are you a businessman 

21.17 31.58 A: i am a law student i actually was a business major as an undergrad though but um we've been talking a lot about affirmative action 'cause we had that uh university of michigan case before the supreme court this year 

31.19 32.12 B: oh 

32.31 36.30 B: and do you agree with affirmative action or bla- 

35.46 40.05 A: um i don't think i have a one hundred percent position in 

40.12 42.70 A: either [noise] saying that i think that 

43.01 46.86 A: in an ideal world everyone should be treated equally and 

46.07 47.03 B: (( right [mn] )) 

46.96 55.28 A: and everyone gets judged based on their credentials and how they do i think i agree that um 

55.82 60.35 A: uh people's color should get equal opportunities as everyone else but 

60.39 68.43 A: um i disagree with any preferential treatment like for example law school admissions is a big numbers game so 

68.72 72.19 A: (( wherever you [noise] hold on one second sorry )) 

72.74 75.76 A: (( sorry my gear might get caught in the door um )) 

74.96 75.64 B: (( oh )) 

76.13 87.92 A: my uh whilst basically it's gets based on grade point average and l. s._a._t. scores so i- l. s._a._t. run scores one twenty to one eighty so let's say you have a white person with 

87.94 94.77 A: a g._p._a. of three point seven five an l. s._a._t. of one sixty 

90.02 90.66 B: mm 

94.84 107.52 A: then you have a black person with a g._p._a. of three point six an l. s._a._t. of one fifty i don't believe that under any circumstances that black student should get in 

107.38 111.16 A: above the white student with the higher g._p._a. and l. s._a._t. score 

111.08 119.14 B: [cough] correct i i agree too and not only you know for business but for you know anything and everything that if 

118.50 119.71 A: right 

119.37 121.08 B: uh you know firemen 

120.38 122.17 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

121.11 124.68 B: they score they're the three hundred and sixtieth person 

124.45 125.06 A: [noise] 

125.00 130.82 B: uh the black person is three hundred and sixtieth and they will pick him over 

125.36 125.96 A: [noise] 

130.87 133.68 B: um the top twenty five white people 

133.52 134.82 A: mhm 

134.15 136.72 B: and to me you know 

136.74 151.62 B: uh we have a lot of fire fighters and that hasn't come up because they usually go to small departments and um that isn't an issue but in cleveland that's a big issue and i don't feel that's fair that um 

139.63 140.52 A: (( [noise] )) 

147.08 147.97 A: mhm 

151.67 155.91 B: that they would be picked over someone who is more qualified 

156.21 158.89 B: um you know grade wise 

158.99 160.43 B: to get the job 

159.16 160.07 A: right 

160.51 174.74 A: yeah i think with everything you should have the most qualified people for the job i mean fire fighting's a good example you know with i'm in a burning building i want the most qualified firefighter going in after me you know i don't want somebody that's just there 'cause of affirmative action 

164.14 165.31 B: right 

169.14 170.92 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

174.37 176.58 B: correct yeah that um 

177.03 182.69 B: um [mn] he may be strong but he might not make the best decision 

182.00 183.98 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

182.92 187.97 B: you you don't know that you need you need strength you need brains you need um 

188.02 192.10 B: people that can think on their feet and sometimes um 

192.39 196.78 B: the one that's two hundred fiftieth or whatever can't think on his feet 

196.55 203.08 A: well that's it one of the things that disappoints me the most is that [noise] you can't really have 

196.89 197.86 B: (( maybe )) 

203.19 207.16 A: too open a debate about affirmative action because anytime you come out 

207.35 212.45 A: and say you are opposed to affirmative action i think sometimes you get painted as a racist which i think is unfortunate [noise] 

212.06 213.22 B: right 

213.32 215.59 B: that a lot of times 

215.63 218.11 B: the dialogue really can't 

218.56 220.02 B: um 

220.10 222.37 B: take place because 

222.55 229.36 B: um i i know in cleveland they started having some of this and some of the white people were trying to 

225.80 226.80 A: [noise] 

229.75 232.28 B: give their opinion and right away 

231.22 233.82 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

232.52 241.60 B: the blacks started brow beating them and everything the they just quieted up they just you know didn't say anymore because they 

235.45 236.45 A: mhm 

238.90 240.29 A: [noise] 

241.75 243.70 B: felt that they couldn't um 

244.25 246.11 B: give their true opinion 

246.19 252.55 A: [noise] right and and the same thing's true in in my law school like uh there was a petition circulated 

252.53 256.99 A: on an amicus brief that they asked the people to sign and support 

256.88 269.91 A: on michigan's affirmative action policy and there were maybe about two hundred people in the law school that signed it including the dean of the school and several professors but there was nobody organizing the other side to you know voice 

269.69 284.45 A: opposition to the policy and you know they organized buses to go down and march on washington but er i mean the there were clearly people with the opposing view but i- it just couldn't mobilize and be vocalized much because you know exactly for the reason that people 

284.31 287.88 A: would be afraid of being tainted as a racist for coming out with that view 

287.54 290.66 B: right right which is unfortunate 

290.54 291.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

290.77 301.72 B: that um you know i i know that in the past sometimes people that should have got the job um black people should have got the job and they didn't 

299.52 301.00 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

301.26 302.30 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

301.94 310.45 B: but it doesn't mean that other white people shouldn't get the job because one person 

305.15 305.96 A: [noise] 

310.56 312.51 B: or two people 

312.68 314.60 B: were discriminated against 

314.29 323.12 A: right and then by the same token you know slavery and all the things that happened you know in in the segregation and all that stuff was wrong 

323.13 334.35 A: but i don't think that you know my generation should have to pay for the sins of you know my great grandfather and before that's generation you know it it doesn't um 

332.17 333.47 B: right 

334.45 339.76 A: you know the the the black people like they weren't slaves and and we weren't the masters you know 

339.45 340.90 B: right that 

340.95 344.39 B: at at some point it has to stop 

344.49 350.95 B: that um how long are we going to have to or do they think we should have to pay for this 

349.64 350.63 A: (( [noise] )) 

350.97 360.15 B: that are they going to continue for another two hundred years saying well they were wronged and they need to be compensated or something [noise] 

358.82 367.82 A: mm [noise] right because it just perpetuates more antagonism and racism um w- when you have it you're going in the other direction 

367.40 368.29 B: right 

368.83 372.78 B: i don't know um they're hoping that i guess the 

369.48 370.17 A: [noise] 

372.88 383.02 B: the younger kids um four and five and eight are going to be able to overcome this and and um 

383.60 389.22 B: see no color lines and that but so often they're influenced by their 

389.31 396.09 B: um parents and their older brothers and sisters that it probably won't happen 

395.92 397.98 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

396.99 398.54 B: just like um 

398.59 399.94 A: (( [noise] )) 

399.38 402.33 B: um i heard somewhere 

400.35 401.04 A: [noise] 

402.56 403.64 B: that 

403.95 405.66 B: i think it was um 

405.85 412.70 B: irish and english kids were brought over here and had a good time and they said well no they would um 

412.88 414.79 B: they would go back and they would 

414.88 421.47 B: try and get along over there and all that and once they got over there and peer pressure started again 

421.59 426.90 B: they forgot all about the lessons they learned here and they were back fighting the other side 

424.99 426.20 A: (( mm )) 

427.36 430.56 B: so it's probably you know the same here 

430.66 431.88 A: right 

431.70 433.87 B: unfortunately but 

434.16 437.00 B: uh we're human and uh 

438.01 440.02 B: in a perfect world 

440.17 441.90 B: or in the next world 

441.92 444.66 B: that's might that might be how it ought to be 

444.70 445.67 A: right 

445.45 446.37 B: (( so )) 

447.62 448.81 B: um 

449.87 453.27 B: gee it's a long ten minutes huh [laughter] 

451.86 461.95 A: [noise] yeah i think um you know we're supposed to talk about the topic for as long as uh we can then we can move on so do you are you disappointed about jim thome leaving 

458.75 459.75 B: uh-huh 

461.56 463.43 B: yes he uh 

463.57 474.64 B: he was good we liked him um he wanted to stay and i don't think that we tried hard enough to keep him 

472.76 473.35 A: (( [noise] )) 

473.44 474.66 A: mhm 

474.85 477.76 A: (( [noise] right )) 

475.03 476.40 B: um 

476.90 479.07 B: that you know he has his 

479.23 481.25 B: his slow periods like 

480.81 481.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

481.38 486.89 B: a lot of them do and he starts slow and that but then he picks up and he's fun to watch 

486.88 489.59 A: [noise] yeah definitely i- it's been enjoyable i um 

489.60 492.53 A: actually just got back from the west coast i um 

493.22 502.92 A: i start my summer job on monday and i had a few weeks off so i've never been to california before i took a trip out there and decided to visit all five of the california ball parks 

496.14 497.39 B: mhm 

503.16 511.78 A: and uh so the phillies are actually out there on the west coast trip clearly i can see the phillies at dodgers' stadium and then again at uh crock hub in san diego and uh 

510.97 511.78 B: (( mm )) 

511.60 523.16 A: you know i- it's fun to watch and then i went up to anaheim actually the ena- the angels playing the indians but i didn't really stay that long 'cause i had i had a long day and went to see the price is right and i had to in line at four o'clock that morning so by the time uh 

521.72 523.03 B: [laughter] 

522.92 536.12 A: yeah the game rolled around at seven o'clock at night i was pooped so i just stayed at the cabana 'cause i wanted to see the ball park and everything but between the angels and the indians i didn't really have any kind of strong rooting interest so it's really hard to watch a game when you don't really care what side wins 

533.60 534.72 B: right 

535.52 537.27 B: right i 

537.33 538.73 B: agree with that 

538.78 549.36 B: that's um how it is with a lot of games that i don't really care like when you get to the world series or the super bowl or anything it's you know i don't care [laughter] 

547.38 548.14 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

548.87 555.96 A: right right [noise] but i uh the but yeah it was it was a great trip california's beautiful um 

549.96 551.02 B: and so i 

554.41 555.57 B: mhm 

556.05 558.40 A: [noise] and yeah then i went uh to uh 

558.44 572.75 A: oakland and i used i used to be into the easts i still am a little bit so i watched them play the yankees that was fun and then uh went to parkdale and watched the giants play the astros and i was rooting for the giants 'cause uh the astros were ahead of the phillies and easts right now so i wanted them to lose 

571.30 572.27 B: mhm 

572.38 573.25 B: (( mm )) 

572.79 573.80 A: (( but uh ))

599.00 599.89 B: well we had our
