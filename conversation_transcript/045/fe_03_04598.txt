261.93 263.29 A: i can't remember 

264.98 268.95 B: [laughter] they were that good that you just can't remember [laughter] 

268.54 271.05 A: well the one that the last one i saw 

271.84 273.10 A: was about 

273.55 278.82 A: this guy who had multiple personalities but you didn't know that when you started watching it 

279.33 281.25 A: and 

281.76 283.93 A: the different personalities were 

284.79 286.27 A: being killed off 

287.90 290.64 A: and it was because he was going through therapy trying to 

292.07 294.87 A: get rid of his bad personality because he was a murderer 

294.67 295.32 B: (( [laughter] )) 

295.37 299.24 B: geez it sounds like sybil which i just happen to have seen the other day on t._v. 

299.37 305.30 A: oh yeah i did see that too i saw the uh the last half of it with sally field 

301.45 302.93 B: (( yeah that was a pretty good mov- ))

321.44 326.27 B: oh she is she was cute i guess she still is cute on e._r. 

327.77 332.04 B: what do you think about when you go to the movies these days and there's always rude people 

327.81 328.71 A: (( gidget )) 

333.43 337.98 A: [mn] well it's very disappointing because you're trying to enjoy 

338.12 339.30 A: a movie 

339.90 345.30 A: and there's all these distractions going on like cellphones and people coughing 

345.48 348.68 A: or talking not even trying to whisper 

349.36 353.28 B: right i can understand the coughing maybe even though i'm sure that can be annoying too 

353.54 356.37 B: but some of the things are just ridiculous 

357.04 360.87 A: i think cellphones drive me nuts people that don't bother to turn them off 

362.08 368.95 B: yeah it used to just be pagers but at least those you just had to hear the little beeps or something but now you have to listen to a whole conversation 

369.71 371.35 A: [lipsmack] i hate that 

371.55 372.74 B: i know what you mean 

373.39 374.70 B: movies aren't cheap 

373.86 374.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

376.16 378.13 A: no not 

378.44 381.60 A: not after you pay for popcorn which i love 

381.98 383.72 A: and drinks and 

385.14 388.44 A: your actual ticket itself yeah it's not 

388.80 390.99 A: for two it's like a thirty dollar night 

391.26 392.21 B: wow 

393.42 394.11 B: hm 

395.51 398.45 B: well what about renting movies do you rent movies 

399.17 402.41 A: uh my wife and i rent movies from time to time 

402.88 404.14 A: we rented one 

404.37 405.50 A: for tonight 

408.15 409.51 B: which is 

408.27 411.30 A: it has cl- a clint eastwood movie called blood work 

412.35 414.43 B: so it's like a make my day movie 

414.88 416.92 A: i don't think so i think that it's 

417.03 418.44 A: more subtle but 

419.91 423.22 A: clint eastwood is a cop in the movie but i think he's retired 

423.41 425.31 A: (( and he actually had a )) 

423.47 424.16 B: (( hm )) 

425.64 428.30 A: you know a blood transfusion or some kind of 

428.91 430.50 A: transplant 

432.71 436.76 A: and i think the killer has something to do with that but i don't know that's about all i know 

440.16 443.01 B: i don't so he has like the killer's blood 

443.34 445.59 A: i think so but i'm not certain 

445.52 447.92 B: oh it sounds like it could have some neat twists 

449.15 449.71 A: (( [cough] )) 

451.49 453.27 A: so we're gonna watch that tonight and 

454.27 459.60 A: since i picked it i've gotta cross my fingers that it's not gonna really really suck 

459.76 462.44 B: yeah don't you hate that when you choose a movie and it sucks 

463.45 464.91 A: yeah 

465.38 472.11 B: i mean i know it's not anyone's fault because it's not like they directed the movie but sometimes they just suck and you're embarassed that you picked it 

474.03 477.29 B: i can think of a few like that like one hour photo 

477.24 479.51 A: (( [laughter] [cough] yeah )) 

478.54 480.86 B: with robin williams what was that about 

482.60 484.58 A: well that one was pretty bizarre 

485.47 488.10 B: it was i think he should maybe stick to comedy 

488.08 488.71 A: (( hm )) 

489.19 492.52 B: 'cause that other movie he was in recently wasn't very good either 

493.33 494.86 A: with al pacino 

495.35 496.47 B: yes 

496.83 497.78 A: (( oh )) 

497.69 499.04 B: he should stick like 

498.06 499.65 A: i don't remember the name of that one 

500.32 501.67 B: insomnia 

501.73 504.40 A: yeah but he actually killed people in that one 

504.58 507.14 B: yeah one hour photo there wasn't anything 

507.31 510.56 B: except for naked people at the end which i didn't even understand 

511.29 519.46 A: it well i turned my head i don't i don't really care to see that stuff i don't know what really what happened i think he just photographed them in positions or something 

520.55 522.18 B: a very odd movie 

524.37 528.29 B: it was kind of just like why why did he do that 

530.93 534.22 A: hm i think that he felt like he was part of the family 

535.10 540.05 A: you know he had all those pictures on a whole you know wall in his apartment 

540.22 546.52 B: well i don't understand why he did it in the movie but i even i meant why did robin williams do that movie [laughter] 

546.19 547.01 A: oh 

547.05 548.85 B: and why did they give it awards 

549.64 551.85 B: isn't it up for like a bunch of awards 

552.23 555.08 A: hey i don't know it must be over my head 

554.58 559.37 B: that's what i just assume if it's something that got an award i'm probably not gonna like it 'cause i won't understand it 

560.00 561.08 A: (( hm )) 

562.69 563.82 B: so how many minutes 

562.84 563.80 A: (( yeah i )) 

564.32 566.19 A: think robin williams kinda 

566.77 569.22 A: went downhill when he stopped doing comedy 

569.23 569.99 B: (( [laughter] )) 

570.92 572.85 A: i think the last one he did was 

573.28 574.67 A: where he was a woman 

576.07 579.43 A: he dressed up like the nanny or something 

579.74 580.53 B: (( oh i )) 

579.87 581.70 A: so he could be with his kids 

581.60 583.41 B: yeah mrs doubt fire 

583.19 584.16 A: that's it 

584.84 586.93 B: well i did like patch adams 

587.80 589.46 B: i thought he was good in that 

588.03 589.60 A: that wasn't a comedy though 

589.75 591.75 B: no but i thought he was good in that 

591.69 593.25 A: yeah i guess so 

593.47 594.87 B: but that was sad 

596.51 597.07 A: (( [cough] )) 

599.42 599.89 B: so
