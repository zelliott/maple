1.62 2.72 B: hi i'm john 

4.29 6.09 A: okay so 

7.06 9.04 B: (( well do you want to start or mhm )) 

8.83 10.72 A: sure um 

11.38 20.44 A: the public school system actually i i haven't been in the public ah i'm i suppose they're saying ah elementary school right high school system 

20.60 27.15 A: i ah actually didn't go so i don't know [laughter] um i went when i was very young 

23.82 25.24 B: (( [laughter] oh right )) 

27.27 28.21 A: um 

28.27 29.74 A: ah just grade school 

31.02 32.76 A: and that was a long time ago 

32.45 34.06 B: right 

33.10 35.74 A: sounds like now things are getting ah 

36.68 47.43 A: how'd you say a little compressed so that problems that would tend to occur in high school when i was growing up um seem to be occurring in grade school now right 

48.26 49.56 A: (( so ah )) 

50.87 56.05 A: yeah i think there's a problem but i'm not exactly sure how how one would address it though 

57.68 59.70 B: (( right what what do you mean the things )) 

59.81 62.49 B: that would normally occur in high school are 

63.74 74.68 A: well i mean when i was growing up it was more like you know issues about drugs and sex that stuff would occur maybe middle school high school right and now it's occurring a lot earlier 

72.04 73.17 B: (( uh-huh oh i see )) 

74.35 75.16 B: (( right all )) 

74.99 81.84 A: right i mean you have issues that ah in some other schools that um i didn't i've heard about 

82.10 89.46 A: kids who are you know twelve years old having sex and sex education and that kind of stuff right so um 

84.43 85.53 B: (( right right )) 

90.48 92.83 B: right yeah well um 

92.92 103.41 B: i mean i i pretty much agree i think i mean i think there's a lot of problems on a lot of different levels i mean i did go through you know the public school system through 

102.41 103.35 A: mhm 

103.57 107.62 B: high school and yeah even college although it's a different system but 

107.31 108.46 A: yeah 

107.82 109.02 B: um 

109.08 114.79 B: and i mean for one thing i i do think that you know some of the problems i mean it depends on where 

114.87 126.17 B: the schools are because um i went to one that was you know um in the inner city and um my even my elementary school you know um 

122.33 123.26 A: mhm 

126.32 134.04 B: there were many people like you know doing drugs and or or even dealing it you know people who i i even knew myself 

134.21 135.31 A: sure 

134.25 140.17 B: and um you know and and that was actually in elementary i mean i remember second grade you know [laughter] it was like 

139.54 140.44 A: yeah 

140.46 145.46 B: um so i i can imagine it's probably just getting worse um 

146.34 156.94 A: yeah i don't have any first hand knowledge i mean there were kids when i was real young too there were some drug issues that would come up you know like you said i think it was even in my second or third grade 

146.38 147.21 B: and 

156.54 157.81 B: (( mhm right right )) 

157.19 167.88 A: but it wasn't at least to me didn't seem very prevalent right i mean it was around but i don't know i mean i couldn't say 

168.12 169.72 A: with any kind of 

169.88 170.83 A: um 

171.81 173.05 A: with any kind of 

173.47 178.02 A: authority whether or not it's actually worse now because ah i'm not a kid 

176.33 179.85 B: right right yeah i mean i have no idea yeah right 

178.27 189.46 A: yeah but the way i would the feeling i would get from the way the the the the media and the press presents it is that it's much worse right so 

190.99 193.94 B: right i think there's other problems too just like 

194.11 195.22 B: um 

195.51 204.69 B: you know my my girlfriend has just finished reading this book called savage inequalities and i mean i i'd heard lots about it i've never read it myself but i do know 

200.02 201.28 A: mhm 

204.82 215.52 B: it's you know um it was written about ten years with some indictment on the u._s. public school system and basically she was saying you know um some of the comparisons 

210.77 211.67 A: uh-huh 

215.58 216.64 B: um 

216.76 225.61 B: between you know schools within the very same district but you know some are in you know wealthier neighborhoods um somewhere in um 

220.45 221.53 A: mhm 

225.48 233.92 B: the poor sections of that very same district and um by sheer coincidence you know one of the districts you know mentioned was um 

234.67 239.29 B: one that my my girlfriend actually does you know social work in 

239.21 240.17 A: mhm 

239.35 244.43 B: um in the bronx and um and that district is split between 

244.49 253.65 B: um a very poor section of the bronx and also riverdell which is a very you know suburbanish section of the bronx and um 

250.10 251.10 A: mhm 

254.13 262.70 B: you know just i mean she's seen it up at you know even before she even read the book she's seen it with her own eyes you know the disparity between 

261.05 262.02 A: mhm 

262.69 270.92 B: you know the the classrooms um the the technology you know the you know even you know things like textbooks you know 

270.27 271.98 A: yeah yeah 

271.16 280.18 B: but you know after she read that book i mean really opened her eyes this isn't you know isolated in any way i mean it talks about st louis it talks about detroit chicago you know 

279.99 281.03 A: yeah 

280.46 283.60 B: um and you know i and i think 

283.66 286.79 B: that i mean that's you know 

287.10 289.63 B: i don't know i mean may there's a link between 

289.66 294.99 B: you know the increasing drugs and and all the other problems in in some of these schools 

295.12 297.96 B: and you know the the 

298.39 302.96 B: things like you know um how wealthy a school is you know i guess that's based on 

303.06 306.46 B: partly property taxes and things like that but 

305.79 307.85 A: mhm 

307.14 309.54 B: but it's pretty you know it's pretty sad i mean yeah 

310.15 312.00 A: well definitely it is 

312.24 313.16 A: but ah 

313.32 317.50 A: so i mean it's pretty much an issue of money then you're saying right 

317.32 328.54 B: i mean i i i don't think that's the only thing but i think that it ties in you know like it it can't be separated from the other problems like in isolation you know 

328.60 329.57 A: well 

328.85 341.12 B: i don't i don't think money in of itself will you know change something around but i do think that it sure as hell would you know [laughter] help you know make like help help a a poorer school make progress you know in terms of 

340.83 342.25 A: yeah 

341.62 350.54 B: you know being able to provide like in in the riverdell school that they mentioned you know every student um in when they hit the fourth grade they get their own i book you know 

350.34 351.20 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

350.57 353.96 B: ah an apple laptop ah yeah 

352.21 354.75 A: really fourth grade 

354.33 355.29 B: (( yeah )) 

354.99 356.28 A: are you kidding 

355.66 365.76 B: and you know i mean not that the- not that the bronx schools don't have any computers they do you know but they're all you know labs you know they're just like stationary workstations 

357.22 358.08 A: jesus 

365.48 369.96 A: well that's a different that's totally different though to get your own laptop 

368.19 375.37 B: um right but i mean you know i wh- but what i'm saying is you know i mean it's not like the labs are that outdated either you know they're fairly 

374.53 375.39 A: yeah 

375.38 383.79 B: you know w- they're they're within like three years old you know um i mean they're not like old pentiums they're more like you know these pentium threes and things like that but still 

377.91 378.79 A: mhm 

383.75 388.72 B: just just the fact that you know um some students are taking home their 

388.57 398.94 B: computers you know and and are guaranteed that and then some students having to rely on you know going you know being at the school if they don't have a computer in their own home you know 

390.08 390.87 A: yeah 

399.29 400.46 A: yeah 

399.85 406.07 B: and and frankly you know the the riverdell students are probably more likely to have a computer in their own home you know so 

405.56 415.46 A: yeah well i was thinking more that it would probably be more a significant issue not if because like in that in that situation you've got two people 

415.47 422.20 A: um who both have access to computers but one has just more access right um but i'm thinking more of like 

417.70 418.37 B: (( yeah )) 

419.24 424.54 B: right yeah yeah i don't think the issue's access it's more like you know the of the level i guess 

424.18 426.63 A: yeah but i was thinking more of maybe 

426.68 430.21 A: um if it would be a greater effect if if if 

430.61 431.56 A: so 

431.70 432.92 A: [cough] if if 

433.41 440.09 A: you have some facilities and resources available in one school and don't have them at all at the other you know i think 

439.48 442.23 B: right then that's a huge yeah a great big difference 

441.50 444.40 A: yeah as opposed to more versus less 

444.18 451.08 A: which of course is a is going to make a big difference as well but um just lacking some basic resources 

450.86 460.04 A: maybe like lacking enough school teachers right um to to be able to control a class or lacking the ability to to attract um 

453.31 454.25 B: (( right right right )) 

460.20 463.77 A: better more qualified or i don't know how you'd say it um 

463.81 468.46 A: um i don't know a lot of the teachers in a public school system are are pretty good too though 

467.89 469.97 B: yeah they are definitely 

468.60 472.25 A: that's the thing they they work real hard um 

473.47 477.89 A: but yeah the the money the money issue to me seems like ah ah 

473.67 475.78 B: i mean the but the sad thing right 

478.64 491.17 A: like if you have and i kind of agree what you with what you said that if you have a lot of money it's not a guarantee that things will be better but if you don't have enough that will definitely make it really hard to be any good all right 

485.72 486.48 B: right 

489.99 494.18 B: i mean the sad thing is they weren't even comparing a boarding school you know 

494.01 494.85 A: yeah 

494.19 494.96 B: with 

495.27 504.12 B: a a bronx public school they were comparing you know the public school um in the p- p- poorer section of the you know of this district 

503.86 504.80 A: mhm 

504.08 515.63 B: versus another public school you know in the wealthier section i mean and they're it's the exact same district you know but i mean i think that's what you know is really the sad i mean because you know i've i've heard you know 

515.79 530.00 B: um about you know people who've gone to boarding schools and private schools that you know and and even as young as elementary but definitely by junior high and high school and and so you know i mean i've already known all that you know i've known from people you know that you know these are 

524.15 525.23 A: mhm 

529.90 537.00 B: you know much smaller classrooms um there's more one on one attention you know things like that the facilities tend to be better 

536.80 537.82 A: mhm 

537.20 544.07 B: but you know you kind of expect that i mean you know y- you can't really change that it's a private school you know it's not like um 

544.38 546.96 B: you know you can't force people not to go you know 

546.75 547.83 A: that's true mhm 

546.98 547.58 B: i mean 

547.55 551.97 B: if if the parents can afford to i mean you know then that that's great for them you know 

551.94 564.93 B: to be able to send their children to something like that so you know but the the sad thing i find i i mean at least according to my girlfriend in this book that she just finished reading i mean that you know these are both public schools you know and in the same school district 

564.45 566.63 A: huh that's amazing actually 

565.80 567.48 B: (( so yeah )) 

566.88 568.38 A: public school 

568.48 572.74 A: giving i books out to fourth graders [laughter] 

570.14 571.16 B: right 

572.08 576.24 B: and now the sad thing was they were in the in the poorer section they were using you know 

576.08 588.20 B: they actually converted one or two of the bathrooms into classrooms because they were so overcrowded and i mean when i s- when i heard that i was just like i don't know i mean maybe i just have to see it for myself i i mean not that i doubt 

580.00 581.24 A: oh my god 

581.97 582.89 A: yeah 

588.18 599.90 B: this author or my girlfriend for that matter but you know it just seems so unbelievable you know and i don't even know what to make of it honestly i mean she just told me last week actually i mean just happened to be 

593.41 594.63 A: well yeah 

596.47 597.26 A: yeah 

598.43 599.15 A: (( mm ))
