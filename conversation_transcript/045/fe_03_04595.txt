289.21 290.46 B: right 

289.87 299.51 A: and then we bring you know all the fixings for that and while the kids are playing i'll set it up and by the time uh when in about thirty five minutes 

299.30 311.37 A: they come back they get some hotdog they get them a coke and then they go play with the kids they're generally out there playing football or something like that you know or just throwing the ball around and economically

315.67 324.36 A: if you're twelve and older it's like four dollars or five and if you're grown it's six so for about sixteen bucks 

324.31 335.16 A: me and my family are entertained uh the kids get to blow off a little energy and and we don't really spend that much at the concession stand only thing we probably go get is popcorn 

334.91 346.83 B: that's not bad i remember drive ins are i like the i like the big thea- you know the stadium seating theaters that's the closest you can get to a drive that that you know you can sit down there put the coke in and and uh and the chair 

345.90 348.39 A: in the little arm holder yeah 

347.43 361.29 B: yeah i like those things i i do like drive i haven't been to a drive through in years so i never know f- they i'm originally from georgia and they used to have drive in theaters but now they're all turned into big old army maxes and in duluth we don't have one so i think i think i seen a 

359.76 360.68 A: yeah 

361.17 366.61 B: down in the city i drove through the city i think i've seen those drive ins do they are they year round drive ins or they they must 

365.85 374.82 A: oh they they generally open up about this time of year and they close about october timeframe or late september 

368.92 369.94 B: mhm 

372.73 373.43 B: (( fi- )) 

374.75 381.39 B: figures i can't i can't see them staying open much past uh when it gets really cold and we can't put the speakers up to the up to the side of the car 

381.12 385.68 A: well you know what they do now tim is uh you they you turn your 

385.82 390.27 A: uh uh radio on to a preset f._m. channel 

389.87 390.96 B: oh really 

390.72 394.92 A: yeah so you got whatever sound quality you got in your car 

394.99 402.19 A: that's what the type that's the type of sound you get from the movie screen and that keeps the mosquitos out and all that 

401.37 402.55 B: wow 

402.35 413.41 A: yep and typical- like for me from an economic economical stand point the drive in is probably the best budget or the best thing for the dollar twelve bucks plus food from ho- 

413.17 424.95 A: from home and and uh yeah and and all five of the five of us are entertained the kids generally go to sleep about ten thirty 'cause i'll watch two movies they typically show three

422.97 423.83 B: (( [laughter] )) 

424.97 426.04 B: wow 

425.82 439.52 A: yeah so you know uh and you know the the picture quality is not is unlike maybe the studio quality but it's still a clear screen you know depending of course upon how dirty your windshield is but 

438.91 440.23 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

439.83 448.15 A: you know and and they typically show first run movies two of the movies will be first run and the other one will probably be about uh three 

448.42 450.69 A: three to four months old depending
