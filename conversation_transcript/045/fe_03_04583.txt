169.31 170.00 A: the 

174.18 175.04 A: okay 

174.24 177.89 B: all right and it's called the delmarva peninsula oh 

177.29 178.93 A: no i'm not real familiar with that 

178.39 181.94 B: okay most people aren't have you ever been have you ever been to norfolk 

179.94 180.97 A: [laughter] 

182.49 185.55 A: uh yeah i've um i used to work on um 

185.81 187.60 A: uh submarines for the navy 

187.09 188.74 B: oh yeah which one 

187.97 193.72 A: and uh i've worked on them all [laughter] um i worked for um 

188.91 190.18 B: [laughter] 

191.29 191.99 B: (( okay )) 

194.16 196.72 A: different ones um and i've been in norfolk once 

196.84 201.94 A: but um the time we went norfolk we had um we were doing warranty work for the navy 

201.50 202.34 B: okay 

202.63 208.63 B: well the reason i asked that if you know where the chesapeake bay bridge tunnel is the real long tunnel that goes across pes- chesapeake bay 

207.53 209.55 A: um right i've seen it 

208.99 213.41 B: okay on the other end of that is the delmarva peninsula and that's where we live 

212.59 213.60 A: okay 

213.47 217.45 B: so con- consequently we live in a very rural community 

217.47 218.40 A: right 

217.85 232.40 B: and um don't wind up going to the movies very much at least you know not because the the first run features or whatever but usually they're out in the in the towns or in the cities before they get to you know the small towns for instance we don't have any 

222.10 222.98 A: right 

232.70 240.40 B: multi-theatered cinemas here you know we only have the old um movie theater like y- you used to have when you were a kid you know and 

234.80 235.66 A: yeah 

239.59 241.03 A: yeah single screen 

240.66 248.78 B: right single screen and you know everybody drive to it and all the rest of the stuff and there's three or four of those up and down the shore and that's all there is right and they're still at this point so 

241.24 242.15 A: yeah [laughter] 

248.79 251.55 B: and quite frankly that's the way i want it to stay for a while too 

250.30 258.33 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] the last one we saw our son took us on his birthday was uh may the first first uh first week of may 

257.95 259.27 B: (( mhm )) 

258.63 261.60 A: and uh he treated us to a movie that was on identity 

261.47 262.43 B: okay 

262.87 265.57 A: so that was that was it wasn't too bad 

265.56 272.91 B: all right so when you go i mean you're are you looking for it as a social engage- uh event you know you're just um 

266.05 266.97 A: but uh 

273.05 276.64 A: i do it because um [noise] it's so um 

276.87 282.74 A: you know the speakers are loud and you're like you're you're really like you're there you know so it's more like the it's more for the 

279.13 280.07 B: okay 

280.42 281.35 B: yeah 

282.84 283.91 A: (( the um )) 

283.94 288.52 A: the uh surroundings and the the big sound and the big screen you know 

288.00 289.31 B: so you're so it's 

288.74 290.69 A: more theat- it's more theatrical 

290.35 297.32 B: what do you sort of like the um the cyber uh realism or whatever you wanna call it yeah right 

295.27 299.18 A: right exactly yeah yeah and 

297.82 303.11 B: so so for you it's mostly an experience escapism type of thing 

301.97 304.17 A: (( um right yeah [noise] )) 

303.54 304.46 B: (( right )) 

304.53 316.98 B: and for me to tell you the truth i guess it's the same thing you know we've we've done the thing in the with a t._v. in the living room where you can pipe it through the stereo you know and get the stereo and and uh 

314.13 315.02 A: uh-huh 

317.08 319.89 B: the deeper fidelity and all the rest of that stuff 

319.13 320.08 A: right 

319.98 325.33 B: we've only got a twenty three inch television so it's not like you've got one of those big screen televisions or anything but 

324.78 326.39 A: right 

325.80 335.34 B: you know if you get focused in on it you know you kinda [laughter] you don't you don't see you know the people walking in and out of your house and stuff like that [laughter] 

328.99 329.81 A: yeah 

331.94 334.01 A: [laughter] yeah 

334.22 343.80 A: yeah that'd be different uh but yeah um going theaters is not is not as much as i guess it's more when you were dating it was uh 

343.55 344.66 B: yeah sure 

343.92 346.83 A: the thing to do when you're married and all that you know 

346.53 349.87 B: uh-huh yeah then you'd just as soon stay home anyway 

349.51 350.76 A: yeah 

350.17 352.25 B: and it's a hell hell of a lot cheaper 

352.30 356.87 A: yeah this the last one we went to see our like i said our son took us and we went in the middle of the day 

356.40 357.28 B: uh-huh 

356.94 365.08 A: so we got in for um the matinee's price so it was it was still da- daylight when we left but that's the only way to go and see a movie is the matinee's prices 

358.06 359.17 B: matinee 

364.47 365.64 B: yeah i know 

365.18 371.20 A: 'cause the ones around here the one we went to i think has had like sixteen different screens issued 

369.84 370.77 B: uh-huh 

371.60 373.74 A: and uh it's it's 

373.82 376.65 A: it's um eight or ten dollars to get in 

376.64 378.09 B: yeah i know as a 

377.31 380.45 A: but if you go in the day time it's um less than five 

380.18 393.85 B: yeah my wife was complaining well see normally here in the evening it costs us only five dollars to get in that's for the normal movie um but like my wife was complaining i forget if she yeah she was talking to my son who just went up to salisbury 

386.63 387.59 A: right 

394.21 408.01 B: uh which is about seventy miles away salisbury maryland and he uh was talking about it was like i don't know eight or nine dollars to get in and then by the time you had done with popcorn and everything it was like fifteen bucks a head you know that you were going to blow and then my 

404.09 406.20 A: yeah [laughter] 

407.01 409.81 A: better take a credit card [laughter] 

408.24 408.92 B: (( [laughter] )) 

408.91 413.79 B: and my and my wife looks at me and says hell it would cost us thirty dollars to go to the theater 

413.64 423.41 B: and it's there's no way in hell that i'm gonna pay thirty dollars you know just to see a movie what what she really meant was i'm not gonna see thirty do- spend thirty dollars with you [laughter] 

417.40 418.26 A: (( no )) 

422.06 425.14 A: [laughter] yeah 

423.34 429.40 B: [laughter] like you say if you were dating you might go ahead and do that but you're not gonna 

428.64 431.87 A: (( [mn] well you've gotta impress the impress your )) 

430.55 436.62 B: yeah right yeah right you gotta throw around some cash and make it look like it's worthwhile [laughter] 

434.35 435.09 A: (( exactly )) 

435.86 442.04 A: but identity was pretty good it was um you know like i said i go for the uh the theatrical um 

440.87 444.10 B: mhm the effect movies yeah 

442.61 446.87 A: theatrical aspects you know big speakers and the whole building shakes they're 

444.83 445.90 B: (( mhm )) 

446.58 449.35 B: yeah that's why the the star trek thing is so attractive 

448.78 450.55 A: bigger than life yeah 

449.95 451.04 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

451.00 453.45 A: i guess going to a movie it would be 

453.48 459.78 A: you know y- if you're going there you might as well go for something that's got a lot of uh a lot of side a lot of effects and a lot of 

459.21 464.84 B: yeah well that's part of the whole reason for the big screen too is so that you can become immersed in the 

462.03 462.88 A: right 

465.12 467.73 B: environment or the event of the whole thing 

466.08 466.84 A: yeah 

467.38 468.96 A: feel like you're there 

468.40 471.92 B: a side note uh you said you worked on submarines

495.01 495.94 B: (( mhm )) 

497.73 504.35 B: yeah and to be quite honest uh fifteen days was all right for me but when they started talking about sixty days underwater 

504.10 505.04 A: yeah 

504.50 507.77 B: nah that was just a little bit much i uh i

519.89 521.04 B: yeah right 

520.42 522.09 A: they're not very sea worthy
