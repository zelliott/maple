167.81 169.34 B: (( oh my god )) 

168.00 173.10 A: the way it is so so so they want a they want a forked tongue is what they want 

173.25 177.77 A: so they they they actually have someone go and cut their tongue in half 

178.00 179.25 A: so that they can 

179.65 181.34 A: have a split tongue 

181.21 185.36 B: wow that must be the most painful thing in the world 

185.14 190.15 A: yeah that um there's there was p- apparently someone who wanted to have 

190.23 192.54 A: legislation against it 

192.71 199.18 B: sure there should be there should be legislation against injuring your own body 

194.65 195.69 A: because 

198.57 203.31 A: and the thing is the guy guy wanted to have it done by a surgeon 

202.90 204.59 B: mhm 

203.54 206.85 A: but the surgeon wouldn't do it because it was self mutilation 

207.11 208.39 B: that's right 

208.05 214.66 A: and so because the surgeon wouldn't do it he went and had it done by somebody from a tattoo parlor

225.23 227.72 A: he has the right to do it 

228.18 229.43 A: you know what i'm saying 

229.44 236.18 B: well i don't think so because uh self mutilation is it i mean if people are 

236.33 241.30 B: really out of their minds [laughter] then we need to protect them [laughter] 

238.65 243.02 A: well i agree i agree you know i mean that's absolutely plain stupid 

242.89 243.95 B: (( right )) 

243.32 244.55 A: it's it's uh 

244.56 246.57 A: but i mean s- i think you know

486.15 487.17 B: (( mm )) 

487.09 488.00 A: (( you know )) 

487.69 488.71 B: yes

535.34 537.35 A: in some ways it is i mean 

538.15 544.97 B: i because after all the uh some black people are getting jobs now where as they didn't before 

544.49 550.79 A: this is true but there's still a lot of people out there you know who are very uncomfortable around them 

550.87 555.87 A: i just think that tha- i- it needs to th- it needs to be a little more flexible 

555.93 557.27 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

556.47 561.06 A: you know what i'm saying instead of having a the a strict quota system

578.93 580.61 B: mhm mhm 

579.60 581.58 A: you know i i think maybe
