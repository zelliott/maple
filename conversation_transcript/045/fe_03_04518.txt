5.66 9.16 A: i'm kevin i'm in los an- well actually orange county 

8.76 22.18 B: oh okay okay i'm originally from southern california wow what a heavy subject last time i called it was pets and i thought oh man [laughter] what a bad day oh but public public school mm 

15.85 20.43 A: [laughter] pets [laughter] [laughter] 

21.79 22.94 A: (( i know )) 

22.78 24.30 B: that's a pretty 

24.36 28.28 A: i know i know um how's the situation out there in arizona 

28.57 29.99 B: what with schools 

29.83 30.96 A: yeah 

30.40 44.88 B: um pretty much the way it is everywhere else the teachers are underpaid classrooms are crowded um you don't really see a lot of the violence situations that that's you know 

37.35 38.81 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

44.92 50.42 B: nightly news topics or something but it's still not a good situation here i think 

50.45 55.09 B: i i've read that the teachers in arizona are some of the lowest paid in the country 

54.89 57.09 A: (( oh really i think i think )) 

55.49 59.28 B: but considering how much teachers are paid that's pretty bad anyway 

59.13 63.89 A: oh really that's um i think i think california is doing okay but um 

64.57 75.96 A: [lipsmack] i think um what you hear on the news might be a little hyped up a little bit but i think i think there is an overcrowding problem definitely in all schools in the u._s. and and the teachers are 

73.73 74.62 B: yeah 

76.34 79.03 A: are most likely underpaid and ah 

80.04 81.17 A: (( and ah )) 

81.81 84.72 A: and plus i guess the students really 

84.85 87.23 A: really don't um 

87.94 99.66 A: feel enthusiastic about the curriculum within the school system i guess they need to change the curriculum and make it more exciting for kids to be more interested in school work 

98.77 99.91 B: you think so 

99.95 100.86 A: yeah 

100.11 102.45 B: i don't know i i think that we're 

102.51 103.87 B: i don't know i 

104.41 116.72 B: i kind of go along with the theory that we're being dumbed down everybody [mn] it's like the whole m._t._v. video thing it's like i i it has to be dressed up and made entertaining and it's like there's nothing 

116.53 124.09 B: entertaining about math but you should know it there's nothing entertaining about you know well there's something entertaining about reading but you know 

118.47 120.74 A: (( mm mhm mm )) 

124.29 137.98 B: you know it's there are just basics that that you kind of should know i kind of get discouraged when i go into a bank or i go into a store and the person waiting on me can't count change back 

137.95 142.90 B: [laughter] and i'm like okay you know [laughter] 

138.16 140.65 A: i know i know [laughter] 

141.08 142.49 A: [laughter] 

142.69 147.22 B: this says a lot about our schools i don't know i have a brother in sacramento and 

145.01 145.90 A: yeah 

147.09 158.52 B: and he and um my sister in law have put my seven year old niece in in private school and he was like you know he goes we've we've been raised in public school and he goes we did pretty good with it but 

154.29 154.99 A: (( mhm )) 

158.34 164.57 B: he goes it's it's different and i don't want my daughter going that way [laughter] like okay [laughter] 

158.58 159.38 A: (( mhm )) 

163.69 165.59 A: yeah plus we need to um 

166.29 170.82 A: to make it safer in ah public schools too sometimes because yeah 

169.52 176.28 B: i think it's just so scary i mean i i'm just glad that i'm not in high school at this time 

176.52 186.02 B: yeah there there's so much pressure and now you have to kind of look at your fellow students and think is somebody you know under so much pressure that they're just going to crack one day 

185.96 189.46 A: mhm mhm mhm yeah i think that's the ah case too 

189.78 190.99 A: but um 

191.45 195.86 A: hopely hopefully they can find the solution to to all the problems but 

196.03 200.82 A: i think it's up to us as ah the voters to do something about it 

201.19 202.60 A: rather than r- 

201.37 208.46 B: what do you think we can do i because i look at it and i'm just like i i don't even know where where they would start what do you think we could do 

209.17 211.69 A: well we could probably open um 

213.34 222.54 A: ah i don't think throwing money at the problem though i don't think is the idea i think um we need just to open more schools and um 

223.73 225.29 A: find some 

225.80 228.79 A: find someway to make the schools um 

229.38 230.31 A: (( ah )) 

230.64 238.09 A: more independent of the government but um not like more li- more like charter schools or something like that where 

237.44 238.54 B: mhm 

238.17 243.55 A: people can people can open their own schools but still you have to have the high standards 

243.77 248.40 A: of what the govern- sort of what the government has with ah public schools 

248.06 255.33 B: yeah we have a number of charter schools here i mean i'm i'm originally from s- from southern california but i haven't seen it 

249.01 249.84 A: (( so [mn] )) 

255.31 268.41 B: over there like i have here there's a lot of charter schools and and a lot of people like it and then again a lot of people say well it kind of creates an elitist private school system so i don't really know too much about it because i don't have a child 

256.51 257.32 A: (( no )) 

268.33 272.13 B: in either system so i've never really had to do the research on that 

270.22 273.28 A: mhm mhm i mean i do- i don't have any kids at all so 

273.21 280.40 B: yeah [laughter] me either [laughter] oh me either but yeah 

273.92 277.83 A: [laughter] that's one reason why [laughter] 

278.10 280.61 A: (( you have no kid you got no kids either )) 

280.50 290.33 B: no no huh uh huh uh but it's kind of it's kind of scary i don't know i look at i look at the high schoolers now and it's been a while since i've been out of high school yourself 

282.76 283.74 A: (( oh okay )) 

290.11 291.75 A: mhm i've been out a while 

290.51 291.70 B: how long have you been

300.06 300.91 A: yeah 

302.37 303.14 A: yeah 

303.24 307.16 A: (( i know [laughter] it runs in my family )) 

309.32 311.38 A: yeah yeah 

309.82 317.88 B: i mean it's just they just kind of look lost and and just hearing the the way they talk and and and the things you know 

313.89 314.70 A: yeah 

318.08 319.45 A: (( yeah i take [mn] )) 

318.08 318.70 B: (( hm )) 

319.46 321.41 A: l._a. has a new um 

321.97 323.36 A: metro rail system 

323.21 324.11 B: (( mhm )) 

323.70 333.80 A: that goes through l._a. and a lot of kids go through there and i go through like sort of the bad neighborhoods and the through the okay neighborhoods and i don't know if a lot of these kids they you know 

331.00 331.86 B: yeah 

333.96 335.37 A: they just don't 

335.55 338.39 A: they do whatever they want they talk wherever they want you know 

338.01 341.95 B: yeah they just kind of look lost like they don't care 

338.65 339.85 A: (( like it's weird )) 

340.33 341.23 A: yeah 

341.95 343.20 A: (( yeah i know i know no mhm )) 

343.08 345.12 B: [cough] i don't know and then i 

345.04 358.94 B: um living where i live you you drive by the if i drive by the local high school it's like there's all these s._u._v.s and i'm thinking wow we were driving mom and dad's third car or you know whatever and these kids are driving 

355.77 356.63 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

358.98 365.83 B: a lot better vehicles and and hey a lot of times it's not even mommy and daddy's it's theirs [laughter] 

364.75 366.78 A: yeah i know it's even worse out here man 

366.79 372.10 A: it's like ah sixteen year old kids driving like forty fifty thousand dollar cars you know 

371.39 373.21 B: yeah i ah yeah 

372.13 375.23 A: for their first car [laughter] 

373.38 379.80 B: i i think that's i think that's part of the problem i think is they get so much it's like hey 

376.40 377.31 A: yeah 

377.39 378.53 A: yeah me too 

379.65 391.85 B: i when i asked when i was at high school and said hey can i have a phone in my room my dad laughed at me but they have they could practically live in their room they have computers and t._v.s and and phones and you know 

379.81 380.87 A: so much so quick 

384.86 385.68 A: yeah 

387.15 388.09 A: (( i know mhm )) 

391.94 396.12 B: [mn] and it's just what do you need parents for you got it all 

395.07 398.86 A: i know you know you got it all you got it you got the whole setup there but 

398.41 399.47 B: yeah 

399.03 401.80 A: (( um )) 

399.64 402.81 B: i think that that might be part of it too it's like 

402.14 404.51 A: but i think that might be part of it too some of the parents 

403.56 409.94 B: there's no pacing if you get it all in high school what are you going to what have you got to look forward to why should you what are you going to work towards 

410.51 414.59 B: so i i don't know it's just a kind of it's kind of a scary time 

415.14 418.48 A: mhm mhm we definitely need a lot more schools so to 

417.55 422.05 B: yeah if you had if you had kids would you put them in public or private school 

419.08 419.89 A: problem 

422.32 423.73 A: (( um if )) 

424.49 430.44 A: i had them i went through the private ah public school i'd probably if i had the money i'd probably put them through private 

430.24 444.28 B: yeah i hate to say that because you know you kind of want to still believe in the public school system but there's just so many problems that i think if i if i did have a child i'd probably i i would seriously consider going through private school myself 

431.12 431.97 A: it's like 

432.66 433.37 A: yeah 

435.87 436.65 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

444.83 449.65 B: so i don't know oh well you live in orange county aren't there plenty of private schools around there 

449.56 454.04 A: mhm yeah well i'm i'm just living out here temporarily i'm trying to move back to l._a. 

454.22 455.44 B: oh

542.96 553.20 B: yeah yeah it's a great place to retire [laughter] [laughter] but you know that's that's funny because that leads to another thing it's like when they vote for things for schools here
