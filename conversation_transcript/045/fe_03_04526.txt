7.35 10.33 A: david yes d- david er i'm aaron 

10.16 11.30 B: aaron 

11.03 11.92 A: yes 

13.28 14.94 B: my father's name 

15.02 17.76 A: well yeah good 

15.80 21.58 B: good uh i'm calling from i live in philadelphia outside i live in philadelphia where are you from 

21.27 22.51 A: from new york 

22.14 23.20 B: new york 

23.28 24.24 A: (( yeah )) 

24.44 28.15 B: well this is an interesting experiment for participating in 

27.80 30.58 A: yeah but uh [mn] 

30.64 32.49 A: and is this your first call 

32.28 33.88 B: my third call 

33.38 34.63 A: oh all right 

34.02 36.21 B: my third and last what about yourself 

36.14 38.54 A: this would also be my third and last 

37.87 39.86 B: uh-huh so what do you think 

39.89 44.08 A: all right i think that that affirmative action is uh 

45.05 48.73 A: is something that's needed if it it needs some 

48.78 49.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

49.61 57.68 A: i think there it's not perhaps applicable in every case but in in certain instances it's it's certainly called for 

58.03 59.97 A: and uh it's 

60.28 63.46 A: my from my observations it's uh 

63.79 71.69 A: it's helped over time even though the people have had problems with it it has probably done more good than harm 

71.33 72.39 B: uh-huh 

72.44 74.51 B: what do you th- go ahead 

72.71 82.48 A: and uh uh it just keeps everyone on their toes 'cause it's uh for the people who gets helped by who get helped by it they have to 

82.43 88.66 A: defend themselves against uh i- er against accusations that they're [noise] not good enough 

88.98 97.54 A: so they have to work extra hard and for the other people who aren't helped by it they have to work extra hard to overcome perhaps um 

97.79 102.27 A: s- you know some you know the uh uh s- a perceived bias whether it's 

102.36 113.22 A: whether it may be the case or not and it may be the case but uh bias against them achieving in their in what they're trying to do so uh it probably raises the bar for everyone 

113.24 114.80 A: because of that 

114.24 126.83 B: uh-huh so i'm interested in whether what you say in some instances you think it's appropriate and in others not what i- what are the what are the situations where you think it is or and what what what do you think not 

126.09 137.74 A: well it's um i guess it's just some [mn] there's some uh positions that that by necessity have to be 

137.94 149.33 A: by merit alone and that you you just have to look at criteria i can't i don't know what's coming to mind right now but i'm sure we could if i had time to think about i could come up with some that are 

150.33 153.88 A: say all right let's go air traffic controller 

154.12 159.97 A: so there's a c- case where it would be a very bad idea to try to implement a plan like this because 

154.19 155.17 B: uh-huh 

160.02 168.67 A: if something were to go wrong then people would sa- would say that that people's lives were at risk because of a plan that may not 

168.68 173.01 A: at on the on the face of it uh look at merit alone 

173.72 180.15 A: so there is some here is a a there would be a case where people's lives were at stake and you shouldn't uh 

180.03 187.89 A: it should be a very rigid criteria and then if people need it they don't they get and they can work in that field then if they don't 

187.76 201.83 A: then they don't belong there in other words at the new york times recently er i'm a journalist so that yeah i've heard a case which everyone's talking about here no the affirmative action [mn] uh 

189.64 191.04 B: uh but see 

202.23 207.89 A: ideology isn't helped by a per- a case where a person was given extra chances 

207.93 213.63 A: to uh to perform in a job that has lots of responsibility and expectations 

213.94 216.12 A: and um he 

216.49 228.36 A: he g- he broke the confidence that a journalist has of telling the truth and a- not acting fraudulently and in doing so he hurt the affirmative action ideal 

228.36 231.82 A: and also he made [mn] you know there is a case where 

232.41 246.41 A: you know people shouldn't be put in that uh level of responsibility for i- w- informing the country about i mean news has to be a very either a case where i don't think there has to be merit base so if he was making mistakes they should have treated him the 

246.36 250.52 A: same way they would treat any reporter who would make that many mistakes or 

250.58 254.18 A: who would do things that were questionable [noise] [noise] 

253.41 256.00 B: (( well i sure ad- er )) 

256.03 259.82 B: my understanding of affirmative action 

260.50 272.84 B: er would be that er that the distinction you make can't be can't be uh can't be is an incorrect distinction affirmative action if i understand it 

272.73 285.24 B: is that where both where two individuals are equally qualified affirmative action in college admissions for instance where person a and person b. are equally qualified 

285.48 294.36 B: or in a job situation where they're equally qualified then uh one person would be given extra points for instance 

294.57 299.83 B: for de- for er wher- extra affirmative action points 

300.16 302.74 A: [noise] well that's that wasn't what i was 

303.10 309.56 A: i i was saying it more like there quo- say a quota uh i- further affirmative action in in 

309.92 312.71 A: say a quota system or saying like this is 

312.76 317.49 A: in the case of the new york times there was that person had entered the times 

317.42 332.37 A: newsroom as part of their diversity effort so they they consciously knew that he was taking a position that was reserved for a person of thi- of his ethnic background so they i mean that that doesn't help anyone 

329.37 331.00 B: [noise] you se- 

332.66 333.74 B: well 

332.86 341.08 A: but that that it's as i i think what you're saying is just one one case of of how affirmative action is 

341.15 349.59 A: is implemented in once ca- in one instance but it's not how it's applied all across the board that's why sometimes this could be a 

344.42 346.18 B: (( yeah )) 

349.76 352.96 A: an in we we may be comparing apples and oranges 

353.00 366.16 B: well i think the the times and the i was born and raised in new york city and uh i was raised on the new york times and uh 

360.27 361.42 A: (( yes yes )) 

363.71 364.71 A: yes 

366.46 370.99 B: the and uh uh the times 

372.05 385.62 B: uh the the recent er ques- the recent er issue about this news reporter is reflective of i think the the prof- the the the sour- to me it's a source of great 

386.96 392.15 B: unhappiness to see the times which i once looked up to 

392.65 400.09 B: uh the times has taken uh the political correctness which is part of affirmative action 

400.07 408.44 B: uh the the times has taken a politically correct view about uh the conflict uh 

408.51 412.28 B: uh the conflict between israel and the arab states 

412.29 415.81 B: and the link between this news reporter 

415.97 421.32 B: and their politically correct position about uh 

421.99 427.02 B: israel or against israel is um 

424.23 425.77 A: right 

427.22 430.60 B: both are driven by a certain ideology 

430.53 443.23 B: that i think is fundamentally uh not in the best interest of the country and not in the best interest of those who it purports to be helpful to 

444.04 447.98 A: mhm well i think that affirmative action is 

448.14 451.48 A: grouped with political correct so you could by 

451.73 463.12 A: but that may not be the case 'cause you're talking about things of two different merits like there is one is that i- there the times does bend over backwards to uh to 

463.63 466.75 A: to the point where the they have anti-israel bias 

467.25 474.84 A: for instance and but that doesn't have anything to do with affirmative action in the united states it happens to be two things that they implement together 

474.87 478.59 A: and it's grouped together but in its uh 

479.20 483.63 A: there is there is a good reason behind affirmative action that was why it was 

483.77 486.63 A: necessary in the first place now there is a point 

486.73 492.94 A: there will be a point and people say we may have arrived there already where it's time to to retire it 

493.16 495.94 B: well i i i think [noise] 

493.61 508.02 A: but m- but there was a time in in the country's history when it w- it was necessary as a way of leveling the playing field when there had been a conclusion uh in the the civil rights era when the black be- 

502.33 504.60 B: when was that 

506.75 511.68 B: yeah but affirmative action seems to me affirmative action far from being 

511.50 522.87 B: a continuation of the civil rights movement is actually a corruption of the civil rights movement and it flies in it flies in the face of the civil rights movement 

518.32 520.36 A: i think you may be right 

522.47 523.38 A: (( right you )) 

523.16 526.42 B: it does i really think it does i really think it does 

526.02 529.25 A: know i think you you have a you make a good point right 

528.24 532.08 B: (( and that uh that uh tha- that uh )) 

532.09 540.89 B: if you survey a hundred individuals who are uh strongly quote unquote pro affirmative action 

540.69 552.23 B: you'll find another hundred individuals those some individuals will take the same politically correct view about the state of israel that the new york times does these two things are 

553.06 558.26 B: hand in hand hand in hand 

558.03 571.14 B: because they stem from a certain perception of how to treat the world and the times no longer is all the news that fits the pi- is all the news that's fit to print but all the news that fits we print 

572.12 572.91 A: (( well )) 

572.20 581.18 B: and uh do you know the editorial page listen everyone had that's what this country's about everyone has a right to think that tom freidman can think whatever he thinks and write whatever he thinks 

581.01 595.65 B: but the lar- but the but the news pages are supposed to present quote unquote the news but the news is essentially continually is is is part and parcel and continuation of the times editorial position 

595.71 598.74 A: yes i i can't argue with you there 

597.62 599.95 B: yeah and uh
