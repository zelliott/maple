52.30 53.29 A: uh-huh 

52.55 63.40 B: with a large screen t._v. so we we i tend to wanna rent it more not only that but after a while i have to get up and you know hit the refrigerator or something 

54.45 55.86 A: great [noise] 

61.75 63.99 A: i know the popcorn 

63.66 67.64 B: yeah a- and you can't hit the pause button in the movie theater 

64.05 64.95 A: (( [laughter] )) 

66.11 69.42 A: no and put the kids to bed [laughter] 

69.08 71.55 B: h- how often do you go to the movies

74.62 75.86 B: oh 

75.55 77.22 A: and um

98.76 99.72 B: (( mhm )) 

99.49 103.08 A: then it's not so easy to watch on t._v.

103.86 107.27 A: unless maybe you have a big screen like you have 

107.64 115.00 B: no i- it's not much easier 'cause of i know that just from once in a while hitting the mute button 

114.62 115.64 A: yeah 

115.04 124.50 B: because there's a conversation going on or something or the phone is ringing so you hit the mute button and what our t._v. does is it puts the it prints the words out across the bottom 

117.72 118.63 A: yeah 

123.96 125.38 A: oh uh-huh 

124.77 130.90 B: and it it to me i find it very distracting 'cause you sit there and you're trying to read the statement a- 

130.23 131.56 A: yeah 

130.94 138.32 B: and then you know the the movie has progressed three more scenes and then the next statement comes on and it's like [mn] wait a minute [laughter]
