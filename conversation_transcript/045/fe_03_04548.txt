0.08 2.58 A: [noise] hi i'm marty down in florida 

2.40 6.16 B: hi marty this is tammy in california [noise] 

5.76 9.44 A: wow we're at opposite ends there three thousand miles apart 

7.50 13.27 B: [laughter] yes we are [laughter] but um i'm good how are you 

10.54 11.72 A: how you doing 

12.87 14.59 A: i'm doing just fine 

14.35 16.63 B: good this uh 

15.41 24.93 A: affirmative action that's what they want us to talk about well you know years years ago i guess i consider myself maybe when i was in my twenties and thirties a liberal 

17.28 20.16 B: (( yeah yeah uh uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

24.74 34.81 A: and thought it was a good thing but then i found out when i worked for the federal government they were the first ones to really use affirmative action lot of times it wasn't the most qualified person 

34.65 44.51 A: that was uh they're making points by having a minority did not necessarily work like i say the best person for the job i don't know if you've come across that at all 

41.61 42.87 B: mhm 

44.08 54.63 B: [noise] um i have come across situations where um there were minorities hired and no they were not the best qualified for the job 

53.61 61.14 A: right yeah see i don't care if you're purple black whatever if you could do the job man or woman great you know then you deserve the job 

54.74 55.40 B: (( mm )) 

60.92 66.02 A: but i've seen people that had a good education and good people skills and were motivators 

65.80 78.68 A: get passed over because well we got a quota system and unfortunately you know i don't think that's that's the right way like i said when i was in my twenties or thirties i said yeah let's give people a chance especially people that normally wouldn't get a chance 

68.51 70.41 B: (( but mhm )) 

78.45 88.19 A: but uh i'm uh fifty five now and in fifty five years i've seen a lot of um people uh getting put in positions that really didn't deserve to be there 

78.46 79.32 B: mhm 

88.07 96.96 B: i see your point of view marty you know i can um understand that but um i really feel that um 

95.48 96.24 A: (( [noise] )) 

97.31 101.42 B: affirmative action has been necessary 

101.30 102.24 A: mhm 

101.30 109.00 B: and at points it still is necessary because the other end of the spectrum 

105.62 106.56 A: right 

108.82 121.58 B: is that there are very very qualified african americans and other minorities who are getting passed over also because of the color of their skin 

109.04 110.27 A: [noise] 

121.01 123.62 A: oh definitely i i agree with you 

121.82 129.88 B: and um there are some areas and i think this really comes down to socio economics 

129.77 137.89 B: there are some people in some areas that have no chance of getting anywhere and because 

137.81 141.35 B: of that something like affirmative action 

141.20 152.82 B: gives them an opportunity to get places where they may be qualified and uh where it could it could really help them out definitely 

148.33 150.85 A: oh right no i agree with you i agree with you 

151.98 152.70 A: (( mm )) 

152.86 154.45 B: so i mean 

153.22 158.23 A: like like like we were saying it's just pros and cons it's plusses and minuses to a situation 

158.15 159.58 B: yeah 

158.42 161.50 A: (( you know unfortunately you know [noise] [noise] )) 

160.12 162.96 B: definitely and uh 

163.26 169.55 B: you know i mean it is unfortunate like you said that that happens but 

169.79 174.21 B: until there is um total equality 

174.43 185.82 B: uh which uh who knows if that will ever happen and it's very doubtful but until there is total equality um for everybody 

177.39 178.93 A: ever happen yeah 

186.15 200.42 B: that's when i think that affirmative action or a programme such as that would not be needed until then in order to be fair somebody's got to come up with something else you know so that 

198.69 200.13 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

200.22 211.75 B: the people that are raised in the gutter and in the and in the ghetto you know um can have a chance yeah instead of [cough] 

206.86 209.19 A: they get a decent shot at something 

209.08 217.98 A: yeah you know 'cause the way we haven't things have cha- i don't know how long affirmative action has been around let's just say maybe thirty years i'm not sure of the uh exactly how long 

212.24 212.83 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

217.12 217.89 B: (( excuse me )) 

217.76 224.24 A: but in thirty years time i guess if you're still white rich and republican you're going to get a lot farther 

224.29 225.52 B: absolutely 

224.52 225.32 A: (( you know )) 

225.51 226.51 A: so 

226.51 231.49 B: and i really think that is very true um 

231.64 243.28 B: it's just that there are so many there are so many people out there that are not given the chance and there's got to be something out there that's fair to everybody you've heard about the 

243.23 253.52 B: w- uh was it is it the university of michigan or some place that was recruiting only like minorities or something did you hear about that story 

252.32 254.22 A: [noise] yeah yeah mhm 

253.58 263.44 B: yeah and i mean i don't think that's fair either because there are qualified you know caucasians out there that have 

263.86 276.55 B: you know everything and um and and they deserve as much of a shot [laughter] you know as anybody who's getting affirmative action so i wonder i wonder what can be done about it you know mm 

276.33 288.60 A: i don't know i guess that's up to the guys in the think tanks to come up with 'cause when the common man uh sees that something they usually don't talk about it unless uh its in mass numbers you know there's there's uh strength in numbers you know 

288.44 290.23 B: yeah 

288.58 293.15 A: but even at that you know things are slow to change unfortunately 

292.74 295.91 B: yeah unfortunately have you um 

294.55 295.35 A: (( yeah )) 

296.19 302.49 B: what uh i don't know how much you follow all the politics and stuff but what do you think 

301.21 305.87 A: i try not to anymore because it actually sickens me to be honest with you but go ahead 

303.08 303.83 B: (( [laughter] )) 

304.17 317.45 B: yeah yeah i'm just wondering um i know a lot of people credit bill clinton for his policies um with race or you know what he has done for different um 

317.44 319.31 B: racial groups and 

319.75 328.90 B: [lipsmack] and everything i wonder how you would compare maybe what bill clinton [noise] may have done and what uh george 

329.07 332.19 B: bush [noise] is doing yeah [noise] 

329.45 330.84 A: george w 

331.01 338.48 A: oh i don't think that cowboy in the white house has done too much right now i think with him in there we're going to go back uh they'll they won't be happy unless it's uh 

338.29 345.32 A: donna reed and leave it to beav and we're back in the nineteen fifties uh they want to go back to a time that they feel that everything was perfect 

345.09 348.10 A: and it wasn't perfect back then either um you know 

347.49 348.98 B: (( mm that's true [noise] )) 

347.89 360.87 A: you can't step back i think uh bill clinton was more of a compassionate uh liberal understanding type of person uh sure he was chasing everything in skirts i mean he was a womanizer let's admit it but most of those guys in power 

360.72 363.55 A: uh they feel they're uh beyond uh 

363.55 376.93 A: touch they could uh drink do drugs chase women and they're not going to get in trouble because uh they're politicians but you know that was one of his downfalls but i think that his policies he tried to do what he could you know i really do 

375.22 376.97 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

377.18 380.12 B: huh yeah um 

380.13 389.55 B: yeah i mean i have not heard too much i mean bill clinton was he did seem to be out there [noise] you know specifically like hiring 

389.72 403.51 B: uh specific minorities that he felt were qualified for different positions and everything which is good you know it helped a lot of people um and i mean bush has um are you there i thought 

393.41 394.34 A: (( huh )) 

399.79 400.93 A: (( well i know )) 

402.05 412.69 A: yeah he's got yeah he's got i mean he's got so but he's got the uh i can't think it condoleeza rice is one of his advisors she's an afro american woman very intelligent woman you know 

403.56 404.85 B: bush has 

408.46 411.66 B: yeah yeah 

412.52 419.95 A: he had some minorities in there but a lot are from what what his staff that i've seen has been around sin- in since the nixon administration you know 

419.30 420.97 B: yeah yeah 

420.84 422.72 A: they're not new to politics 

422.79 435.01 B: well it sounds like they're trying to get rid of the entire you know affirmative action altogether the policies altogether i mean just from things i've heard in the news you know 

429.98 430.85 A: (( mm )) 

434.79 441.09 A: yeah it would be good if they could overhaul it somehow and uh still make it fair but you know 

441.28 446.68 A: i i wouldn't know how to do it you know i've always been a walking stiff since i was fifteen and uh 

443.32 445.19 B: yeah 

446.07 447.10 B: yeah 

447.62 453.87 A: i don't have the honest answer how to do it it's just you know i got my opinions and all of that but uh 

452.69 458.61 B: yeah yeah i know i wish i had all the answers too but you know 

456.74 459.72 A: [noise] yeah it would be great we'd make the country better 

459.50 462.85 B: [laughter] somebody needs to 

461.46 463.84 A: so where in a- where in california are you 

464.00 471.02 B: uh uh in uh southern california near the l._a. area yeah 

468.16 479.13 A: oh okay yeah i used to have this i used to uh i was stationed in san diego back in the late sixties and i used to go to uh mexico a lot and laguna beach i used to love laguna beach 

477.88 479.50 B: oh yeah 

479.55 483.13 A: well i couldn't uh you and me we couldn't afford that you know [laughter] 

479.67 480.61 B: (( well i'm )) 

482.25 493.44 B: [laughter] yeah i mean this place is is pretty nice i'm trying to figure out what all the policies are on on you know race and all that too and on uh 

492.20 493.16 A: yeah 

493.41 503.02 B: um just just everything 'cause i'm still kind of new to the area but um i wonder how the state feels about like affirmative action and all that too 

497.94 499.80 A: uh-huh where where were you 

502.81 511.03 A: that i don't know i guess you could if you got a computer or something or go to the library you could fi- find out uh where did you live before you lived in california 

504.08 505.95 B: yeah 

506.10 507.77 B: yeah 

510.82 512.34 B: i was in kentucky 

512.29 516.18 A: oh okay yeah i guess that's a big difference [laughter] [noise] 

513.16 514.58 B: yeah 

514.91 528.77 B: yeah yeah all right so i mean i guess i i'm a little worried i mean are they going to pay us if we're not talking about does it have to be about the topic the entire time do you know anything about this 

516.68 517.63 A: yeah 

524.49 525.35 A: oh 

528.78 539.26 A: no i've only done it uh two calls before so i haven't gotten paid yet but i think we- we've discussed it a lot we only steered to the side when i asked you uh where in uh california you were living 

538.17 542.56 B: oh right yeah i mean i didn't have a problem with that at all i just wonder if uh 

539.45 540.71 A: (( so i did you know )) 

541.36 542.34 A: yeah 

542.58 543.83 B: if they 

542.78 545.12 A: no i'm pretty sure they will 

544.76 548.18 B: yeah i wonder what this study is for 

545.39 547.08 A: [noise] so uh 

548.92 555.43 A: i guess they got to take a poll you know with all the people that do this call and see how they feel about affirmative action and uh 

554.73 555.56 B: uh-huh 

555.77 563.73 A: you know turn the pa- paper uh the results of the poll in somewhere uh i did one last week and one the week before one was about 

563.63 574.34 A: uh sports and athletes i forgot what the other one was uh my mind is elsewhere but um doing the first one it was kind of like a real uh technical heavy type of one you know 

566.26 567.04 B: (( mm mm )) 

568.66 569.47 B: uh-huh 

573.73 574.76 B: oh 

574.47 579.17 A: but i guess we did pretty good uh expressing our views 

574.95 576.01 B: let's see 

578.96 581.50 B: yeah yeah um 

579.57 583.24 A: [noise] you know in the time limit and all of that [noise] [noise] 

582.56 597.29 B: i wonder why they have the computerized you know with the you know having it all computerized and i'm assuming it's been recorded and everything i wonder if we're going to be like hearing something about it on t._v. one day you know with our voices 

594.35 596.13 A: (( yeah that would be nice to know )) 

596.57 599.95 A: yeah maybe they're doing some sort of cross section um
