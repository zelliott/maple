0.53 3.97 B: uh hello i'm david thomson from mississippi 

3.70 8.00 A: uh hi my name is jalal i uh live in washington d._c. 

7.97 9.65 B: okay well how you doing 

9.06 10.35 A: i'm okay how are you 

10.04 16.90 B: okay i'm good um so this is my first time to initiate a call for this so 

15.96 16.78 A: okay 

16.91 19.85 B: i just uh what do you think about affirmative action right 

19.43 20.42 A: um 

20.64 30.93 A: i think the the policy when it was created was it it had good intentions in terms of of righting past discrimination i think that uh 

31.52 45.93 A: i- it still in a sense a good policy in terms of diversifying the workplace but it it has this kind of stereo type that affirmative action means that non-qualified minorities are going to be hired 

45.90 54.65 A: um so i mean there there are positives and negatives because it is good to you know have a diverse workforce but then when you know 

52.24 53.39 B: right 

54.91 58.07 A: if you have a person of color in a in a job 

58.12 67.71 A: there there's a stigma that that person didn't get the job on their own merits but got it because of affirmative action and you know they're an an underqualified minority [noise] 

68.05 75.51 B: um that there are still effects and ways that um it started out as a good policy but uh i'm actually pretty strongly 

75.63 77.41 B: opposed uh 

77.63 83.20 B: to affirmative action nowadays uh because i'm living down here it's 

83.25 86.82 B: it's a really big thing my dad has been 

87.01 92.79 B: um throughout his years has been considered for promotions and denied because 

93.16 102.07 B: a minority has applied um i think it's just reached a point where everybody has had the same education opportunities and i think it's it's 

102.25 111.68 B: reached a point where it could be i i believe it should be dropped because i believe everybody's had the same education opportunities and so i believe everybody should be 

112.00 113.66 B: [cough] considered for 

113.75 118.69 B: um employment based on their qualifications rather than you know being 

118.95 122.46 B: considered um for a job because of their race you know or 

122.60 134.95 B: something like that uh but i do agree that it it is a good policy when trying to introduce diversity into the workplace but um when it comes to just employment uh i believe that it should be 

135.30 136.16 B: um 

136.20 137.79 B: gotten rid of 

138.15 149.84 A: right i i agree with you in part um in terms of you know 'cause i- wi- with the statement you made about your your father it's kind of what i was saying you know that um 

147.10 147.87 B: (( mhm mm mhm )) 

150.10 161.36 A: i- if a minority is given a position it's not know you know or it's almost assumed that that person got that position because of affirmative action policies and not based on merit alone um 

161.36 174.15 A: and and i also disagree in that you know i don't think everyone has an equal education um 'cause there's a lot more i i grew up in connecticut and there were a lot more resources in that state in terms of public education 

173.49 174.71 B: (( right )) 

174.15 186.33 A: than you know uh in parts of mississippi for example or even you know in parts of connecticut because funding was uh based on on what town you were from and because 

184.42 185.18 B: (( right mhm )) 

186.28 194.34 A: [lipsmack] in a in a lot of instances the poor towns in the state tend to have larger minority populations there 

194.46 205.65 A: there's a disadvantage that you come you know you're from your parents are poor so your school system wasn't that great and you're kind of disadvantaged there but i think in terms of of uh 

205.73 212.15 A: employment while the- there needs to be something done in terms of diversifying the workforce 

212.50 226.42 A: affirmative action or the name affirmative action needs to be thrown away because it now has such a a negative stigma to it but i also think that the um the e. e. o. c. needs to do a better job in terms of of making sure that uh 

218.42 219.60 B: right 

226.33 239.45 A: that companies are are really doing a good job to do outreach and diversify their workforces and not just kind of doing nepotism or you know just hiring people's friends or from within that circle um 

239.59 240.82 A: so 

241.08 251.49 A: yeah i i mean i i agree with you in some part but then there's i also realise that you know if if we completely do away with with affirmative action like policies 

251.31 260.93 A: there is the great chance that in many communities that uh people who aren't white won't be considered for jobs that they may have been considered for before 

260.73 269.91 B: right well um i do agree with you in in some ways uh but about the education opportunities down here 

269.95 277.97 B: um it is it is changed greatly and actually mississippi is the very first state in the united states to have a computer in every single classroom 

277.49 278.59 A: mhm 

277.97 290.53 B: and things i mean things are really changing i think i'll i mean if i am rushing it saying that it should be done away with now then i think in at least twelve years it should be done away with because if we have a computer in every single classroom 

290.58 303.59 B: um down here then i believe in twelve years that everybody's had the same educational opportunity not just i mean i have my dad actually grew up and i have some friends in his home town it's very very small it's 

303.69 305.43 B: twelve hundred population 

305.52 312.86 B: town and uh the school there have computers in the room i've been there and actually they've renovated it's i mean it's not really as 

313.48 322.56 B: rural places i mean they've made extreme efforts if not more effort in the rural areas than in the um larger cities they made an effort to improve the classrooms 

322.51 330.26 B: and so i think if if uh if the child is starting now a minority is starting now i think in twelve years when they've completed high school i think they've had 

330.40 331.31 B: um 

331.64 335.68 B: a great opportunity just as equal opportunity as everyone else 

335.92 347.41 B: um of all the different races to complete that and to make the same grades they've had the same opportunities and i i just think it it it just really frustrates me that i've i've there's a lot of people that 

341.65 342.88 A: mhm 

347.49 361.04 B: use that down here they really milk it they milk affirmative action policies they um you know they'll file suits um if they don't get a job because they'll say that they didn't get a job because they're a minority and i- it really does happen 

349.90 350.72 A: mhm 

360.95 370.55 B: a lot like down here and i guess i now see a lot of it and i see the negative uses of it um probably more than i see the positive uses of it and um right 

368.57 376.71 A: right but the the funny thing is actually that the greatest beneficiaries of affirmative action policies are actually white women and um 

377.12 388.46 A: so it's kind of odd that in considering the the debate of affirmative action it seems like no one's considering what effect or effects that it'll have on in terms of of women 

388.40 393.53 A: in in a in positions of employment 'cause i know like where i work 

393.47 404.50 A: um out of the management staff i i have a government job and um out of the i think there's five managers and only one of them's a male and the rest of them are are females 

404.33 412.62 A: um so you know you see the great the great benefit of affirmative action there and you know kind of doing away with the stigma that women aren't as good a employees as men 

412.64 413.88 A: and it's a 

413.99 416.50 A: you know you don't kind of see the um 

416.97 421.30 A: the outcry when uh a woman gets a job 

421.42 429.27 A: as opposed you know and a man is passed up a- as when you know a minority whether that minority be um male or female gets the job 

423.34 424.32 B: (( right [noise] mhm )) 

429.35 435.05 A: so i i still think that the country has a long way to go in terms of of 

434.90 439.47 A: dealing with diversity in the workforce and and making sure the people do have 

439.26 449.79 A: a real opportunity to um apply for jobs that they're qualified for and to and to actually get those jobs but at the same time you know i i get upset when 

449.57 457.66 A: when politicians start saying that you know tha- that affirmative action's about quotas 'cause it hasn't been about quotas since you know the seventies so 

457.81 472.49 A: they're just trying to get it you know people riled up and get reelected when they say that and and it's unfortunate that you know we realize that yes there's a problem with the system but no one's really suggesting any ways to fix it 

473.35 476.87 B: um what do you i mean what what do you think is the um 

477.23 481.79 B: is the reason why we don't look at um qualified minorities 

482.07 486.11 B: what is the reason um behind that do you think 

485.82 492.04 A: uh i think part of it is you know the political rhetoric of of affirmative action because um 

492.05 505.20 A: you know it's not it's just kind of assumed that you know if this person gets a an executive position that it's because of some kind of affirmative action policy and not that you know this person's worked really hard and or 

505.19 514.00 A: they they went to college or the right college for that that matter you know 'cause it's still a matter of um of what college you go to 'cause 

510.19 510.89 B: (( right mhm )) 

514.00 520.89 A: you know you you may go to to uconn for example and not get a job because another guy went to to yale 

520.68 534.88 A: you know so there's still the you know the preferences in that term and there's always kind of preferences in society so even if you're not hiring only white people or or hiring only black people there's still going to be some kind of preference you only hire people from from your alma mater 

534.53 535.54 B: (( mhm right )) 

534.74 540.87 A: and i think those are issues that really need to be addressed and that it goes well beyond you know um 

541.22 550.94 A: just the the rhetoric of you know these people are getting jobs because of quotas which hasn't been true these people are are getting jobs over 

550.72 554.98 A: people who are or these people who are underqualified 

554.75 566.28 A: are getting jobs in place of someone who is qualified and when i think if you look at it well there are two qualified candidates and this is what affirmative action was really intended to do you have two qualified candidates 

566.06 578.62 A: and to kind of rectify the p- past problems instead of saying to this white male well you get the job and the black male you don't get the job because well hell you're black you know it's like well to kind of 

578.69 584.21 A: add diversity to the workforce and to give people a fair chance you say well we have two qualified candidates 

584.80 588.91 A: um let's take the black candidate and 

589.07 599.95 A: it's not saying that the person is not qualified for the job at all it's just a matter of diversifying the workforce so that it's not a continuation of of uh preference for the majority
