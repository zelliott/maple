114.18 115.28 A: right 

115.04 119.96 B: it really should have been a lot more ah productive with the kids 

120.19 130.33 B: they have gun problems i mean certain areas like you drive through richmond and literally they what they did is they put up ten foot high 

130.76 135.62 B: um wire fences with concertina razor wire on the top 

134.98 136.42 A: oh my gosh

147.58 149.05 A: oh my gosh 

149.36 159.82 B: and the yeah i mean that bad they have armed guards at the door to frisk the kids when they come in because they're packing knives guns drugs

162.17 163.09 B: (( you know )) 

166.94 173.27 B: yeah and it gets it's gets a little worse it's ah it's what they call a drug free zone because 

167.73 168.58 A: oh 

172.24 175.06 A: yeah they all say that but 

174.06 175.02 B: really

176.86 183.00 A: yeah right way they have signs out front drug and weapon free areas and 

179.67 180.55 B: yeah 

182.16 190.92 B: the thing was i mean they were really i mean they were recruiting the kids right at school because you know the kids don't get persecu- prosecuted 

186.81 187.61 A: (( mm )) 

190.60 197.86 A: and so what do you do if you're a parent i mean you can't hardly get your children out of that school if you live there

199.39 200.31 A: oh 

200.03 203.71 B: there's christian schools my my church runs a school 

203.97 205.25 A: right 

204.58 211.14 B: and they're the cheapest in the county and there's a waiting list to get in because people want their kids here 

210.79 212.13 A: oh my gosh 

211.48 223.82 B: because you know they're getting good values you know respect your parents work hard be clean and neat and really really practical things you know good study habits

237.86 246.00 A: see i don't know how i feel about that either i mean i don't know what to do if it just comes down to they need more money if 

240.07 240.96 B: yeah 

246.03 250.34 A: i don't know i guess i just really feel parents are so responsible for that 

250.27 255.57 B: well that's really true unfortunately in a place like richmond that's you know 

255.84 259.55 B: the parents can't change the whole drug culture that's that's there 

258.78 260.37 A: is that a small 

260.55 262.51 A: city or is that a big city 

262.38 266.96 B: ah richmond's p- i don't know probably a hundred fifty thousand 

267.01 267.75 A: (( mm ))

390.27 394.63 B: well i went i went all the way through high school but i was a real under achiever 

394.97 401.39 B: i graduated the middle of the pack and i i was smart enough to be in the top twenty or so 

401.54 403.02 A: oh that's nice 

402.69 403.72 B: you know 

404.26 405.85 B: i i took ah

410.67 411.78 A: right 

411.91 415.35 B: my score was extremely high i could have got into berkeley 

414.80 416.32 A: oh my gosh 

416.06 422.47 B: and when my counsellors saw that they said no this guy can't do that so they made me take the test over 

422.14 423.10 A: (( oh )) 

423.11 426.77 B: and since i'd just taken the test a week before my mind was pretty 

426.80 430.00 B: geared up i did better the second time 

427.59 429.26 A: right 

429.36 431.15 A: oh my gosh 

431.25 433.38 A: yeah funny how that is huh 

432.66 433.92 B: yeah 

434.07 436.31 B: so i mean i wasn't really 

437.69 443.40 B: you know the thing the thing is in high school in school you learn a lot about socialization too and that's 

443.49 447.27 B: ah that's something i didn't really learn i was into athletics 

447.41 448.58 A: right 

448.16 452.21 B: but um there's more to the school than the grades you know 

452.42 456.08 A: well and i completely agree with that because 

454.77 455.43 B: (( [cough] )) 

456.24 458.69 A: shoot it was hard for me 

458.50 460.27 B: yeah 

459.36 461.45 A: it was really hard and 

461.16 464.32 B: you've got to learn to get along with people you know and ah 

464.71 470.88 B: to assert yourself and defend your friends and you know there's a lot of a lot of things that you need to learn 

470.54 471.66 A: right 

471.54 474.05 B: that that don't show up on the marks 

473.61 476.18 A: mhm right [laughter] 

475.82 477.16 B: yeah 

476.49 478.92 A: yeah so i don't know i usually 

478.04 488.05 B: well i don't know yeah home schooling is a good one ah christian schools i think are good simply because i you know i wouldn't be at home with a kid but um 

486.54 488.40 A: [laughter] 

488.45 490.49 A: i i'm a stay at home mom 

490.67 494.38 A: so that to me is okay i like to have him here anyway 

490.87 492.08 B: yeah yeah 

493.91 498.37 B: well i'm sure it's lots of fun i i really love kids it's it's really surprising 

498.42 502.58 B: the love you feel automatically i mean other people's kids you just you know 

502.74 505.26 B: you just get there you just love them 

504.68 505.90 A: right 

505.51 508.20 B: and there's no effort there's no intent to 

507.85 508.96 A: right 

508.76 513.86 B: you just kind of want to take care of them teach them things it's just automatic it's like a reflex 

513.85 520.22 A: yeah so i don't kn- i definitely do agree with the home schooling thing i guess if you live somewhere where ah 

514.00 515.05 B: instinct 

517.79 518.92 B: (( mhm )) 

520.24 525.82 A: your school is actually that bad which i cannot even believe i couldn't imagine even driving by a school like that 

526.13 531.62 B: yeah yeah it there have been times you know when they have they have to shut down the school because ah 

532.48 536.06 B: you know they there'd be violence in the school yards or 

536.60 542.48 B: ah you know they don't always they don't always get the ah the people if they come by with ah 

542.91 545.87 B: you know they don't catch everybody going in the school with a knife 

545.53 547.17 A: (( [noise] right )) 

546.48 551.59 B: because they they have little scanners they might scan the pockets but not the you know the socks 

551.32 556.54 A: yeah that's about my guess as bad as i think it is here and it seems to be 

554.75 555.65 B: yeah 

556.91 558.63 A: (( worse i don't know )) 

558.21 559.38 B: yeah 

558.81 565.08 A: and with my son b- he just turned six i can't imagine dropping him off at a place with ah barbed wire 

565.00 567.83 B: yeah it's like sending him to vietnam or something you know 

566.84 568.28 A: oh my gosh 

568.43 571.85 A: yeah i mean not even to go outside to play on for recess 

572.31 578.33 B: and the r- you know they're that's one thing i don't like about most christian schools that i've seen is their yards are all concrete [sigh] 

578.53 580.74 B: they're that way in most of the city too 

580.82 583.11 B: there's no playing field you know 

583.03 584.05 A: no 

583.73 587.58 B: no field there's just all concrete and it looks very depressing to me 

588.32 590.69 A: yeah i don't know it's the 

591.43 595.10 A: tough i don't know i don't know [laughter] 

594.28 598.94 B: it's a harder time than ever to be a kid i mean you know because we're such a high tech world 

598.71 599.89 A: right
