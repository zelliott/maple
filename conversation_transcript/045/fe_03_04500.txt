27.83 28.83 A: yeah 

32.18 38.27 B: relatively recently ah type a lot of money that went to some public programs including school 

37.06 37.84 A: (( okay )) 

38.45 48.83 B: we actually ah don't have a five day school week here anymore in the public school system it's a four day school week because we can't afford to keep the teachers there yeah it's pretty bad 

44.94 46.46 A: oh really 

47.31 52.21 A: that's got to be horrible especially with people i mean parents working and 

52.31 56.82 B: yeah the it one of the other programs that they one of the other things that they tried when they did that 

56.75 67.59 B: is they cut the amount of police officers that were on the street and they let a lot of people out of jail because they couldn't afford to keep them there so while you're not in school you're out running around [laughter] 

62.65 63.77 A: oh man 

66.20 68.14 A: yeah that sounds horrible

72.07 77.22 A: is that is that for every school or just th- a certain amount of schools or what 

76.64 80.07 B: ah i believe it was within the state

80.98 83.63 B: the state of oregon yeah 

82.19 84.15 A: did that just start the four day 

84.15 93.67 B: oh it started a couple of months back there's a particular um venture that was going up for vote and ah the majority of the people didn't want to pay an extra two dollars a year 

86.21 86.90 A: (( okay )) 

93.87 97.78 A: (( is it ah is it a ah )) 

98.02 98.89 A: (( a ))

99.61 101.68 A: is it a a longer day or 

101.80 104.29 B: no it's the same same day 

105.08 106.02 A: (( oh horrible )) 

105.27 106.09 B: so 

106.33 108.21 A: i hadn't heard about that 

107.91 109.76 B: so how are things wherever you are 

109.46 112.79 A: um they're pretty bad i live in i live in brooklyn 

112.23 113.22 B: oh okay 

113.09 114.86 A: new york and and ah 

115.02 116.78 A: yeah it's horrible 

116.31 118.12 B: yeah 

116.93 118.03 A: they're ah 

118.42 124.21 A: they're trying to make it better by ah if people will teach they forgive your student loan 

124.51 125.73 B: oh wow 

125.35 126.72 A: but then um 

127.36 132.54 A: those kind of clinton's deal he he declared a state of emergency and and set that up 

132.63 134.09 A: and um [mn] 

134.43 140.78 A: that works i- to a good to a point but then a lot of people that maybe aren't qualified to teach teach as well 

140.17 142.08 B: right 

140.98 145.40 A: but at least there are teachers where a while back there was quite a shortage 

145.39 146.65 B: oh okay [sigh] 

146.42 147.29 A: um 

147.49 150.04 A: it's it's pretty bad though i mean 

153.72 158.52 A: i did now a four day thing i i don't know a whole lot about about it but ah i 

158.60 161.67 A: mean there's a lot more violence in the schools 

161.20 163.00 B: right 

162.51 167.80 A: and ah we just cut a lot of um police officers and fire fighters 

167.95 170.34 A: and that that doesn't help 

169.82 171.63 B: right 

172.10 175.88 B: you know i to me when i think about t- you know teachers i think 

177.23 186.09 B: teaching is probably one of the most noble professions out there you know just the people that have influenced me the most have been for the most part teachers you know and it's just 

179.82 181.05 A: oh for sure 

186.76 190.21 B: i don't understand when when you hear or you see that you know 

190.67 197.56 B: the schools getting money cut or teachers not being able to afford certain things because they're not getting paid enough you know it just doesn't seem like it's a resource that's 

197.73 202.14 B: valued or taken care of and it really makes me kind of ill [laughter] 

201.58 203.06 A: yeah definitely 

202.45 204.69 B: you know to kind of think about it because that's 

205.02 210.40 A: well they could easily take a few dollars from a lot of other programs that aren't doing us any good i mean 

209.81 211.90 B: exactly 

212.21 214.30 B: exactly 

212.87 215.50 A: ah so many programs that aren't doing us any good 

214.87 216.34 B: [laughter] 

216.56 226.53 B: exactly you know i mean there's a there's actually a pretty active campaign here in portland to bring big league baseball to the area and there's been more advertising on t._v. 

221.26 222.05 A: yeah 

226.66 237.57 B: for supporting big league baseball than there was for supporting the schools when the measure went up for the vote to cut money from the schools and i just i mean nothing against baseball i mean 

232.84 234.25 A: yeah horrible 

238.05 242.26 B: ah i'm not i'm not like a fan or anything but i have nothing against it or anything like that but 

242.15 242.97 A: right 

242.23 254.42 B: you'd think when you think in terms of importance to society [laughter] playing baseball versus school [laughter] there'd be a lot more support and information available out there but there just wasn't 

248.90 250.64 A: (( yeah it's horrible )) 

256.51 262.63 A: yeah yeah it's it's the same way here i mean a lot much more money is spent on sports rather than 

262.72 264.12 A: education or 

264.15 265.92 A: most programs 

265.51 266.59 B: right 

266.26 267.30 A: and um 

268.18 279.12 A: i mean as far as bringing revenue in th- i mean we need the education and the safety of our city and the city's just going i- it's been going you know the crime rate has been going down and down and down 

279.50 283.28 A: and now i think it's just going to it's going to turn around in the next year or two 

282.98 284.75 B: really 

286.15 290.03 B: [sigh] yeah it's it's pretty rough here i mean it's 

290.25 295.29 B: most of the the day off that they give them now is friday so the the school week is monday through thursday 

295.10 296.06 A: okay 

295.49 302.88 B: so if you go anywhere on friday you'll always see the kids out doing something because both parents are at work if there are both parents in the first place 

302.62 304.26 A: right 

303.56 308.80 B: you know there's just nothing going on and nothing to do and it's you know that's not helpful it's not 

309.90 310.74 B: (( you know )) 

310.14 314.19 A: h- have people set up programs for the for the friday 

314.01 315.22 B: you know i 

315.31 318.53 B: because i don't have kids and i you know i don't have to 

318.26 319.42 A: right 

318.87 325.20 B: because i'm not a parent i don't know i'm sure there are some things out there but i can't imagine it's enough 

325.28 329.09 A: yeah that's another thing that was cut in new york is after school programs 

328.53 330.52 B: really 

329.42 340.14 A: and that's i mean that's horrible because it means people who need to work and you know for a kid in new york it's it's not like you just go hang out somewhere i mean that's what kids do and it's it's all right but it's 

340.20 343.27 A: i don't know it just seems a little a little scary 

342.90 344.67 B: yeah 

344.91 353.36 B: i mean i'd like to think that when i was growing up i was a pretty good kid but you know i'm not someone's out there but maybe in the school you know they need something to do 

352.01 352.87 A: right 

353.32 358.27 A: yeah i mean i i had a free day ev- all friday that would have 

354.32 355.17 B: (( you know )) 

358.28 360.51 A: you know i probably would have turned out different 

360.25 363.01 B: (( [laughter] yeah i can see that with me too )) 

363.90 368.28 B: see that with me too you know though when i was going to school though i don't remember there being such a i 

369.69 377.40 B: mean i knew there was a w- and i've always felt that there's not enough money for teachers in schools but when i was going to school when i was in public school and that was like ten years ago 

377.41 382.08 B: i don't remember thinking gee i wish we could do this we just can't afford it because the school system's broke you 

382.26 383.07 A: right 

382.44 394.82 B: know i w- i wonder if that's a more recent phenomena or if i'm just now suddenly noticing it and paying attention because i'm in a position where i am paying taxes and and that kind of thing you know i'd be interested to find that out 

391.08 391.95 A: right 

394.48 395.77 A: it's a good question 

396.93 401.28 A: i mean ah i don't know i feel like when i was a kid that we had all the books 

400.79 402.70 B: mhm 

402.11 414.18 A: the books we needed there wasn't like a a fight or a need to to get the books paid for they just came and and now like you know some schools make the kids bring money to pay for textbooks or they have to share 

412.57 415.24 B: do they do that in public schools 

414.50 419.54 A: yeah i think so because some some schools the district can't afford it or 

419.62 423.44 A: you know kids have to once in a while they photocopy it 

420.76 421.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

423.56 426.72 A: and then hand out the photocopy to everybody 

426.49 431.12 B: wow i didn't know that that's pretty scary 

430.04 431.10 A: (( yeah it's )) 

431.12 439.68 A: ah it's horrible i mean i don't i don't know a whole lot about what's going on because again i'm er like you i i don't ha- i'm not a parent and 

440.15 441.07 A: so i don't 

441.39 443.63 A: i don't deal with it a whole lot but 

442.96 444.82 B: (( right )) 

444.86 448.42 A: i guess i'm just i'm i know what the media fed me 

448.09 450.80 B: right that's true that's true 

451.57 457.02 B: you know my wife and i aren't going to have kids for a while because you know we're college students right now we're dealing with things there but 

456.91 469.48 B: we've ta- you know when we have kids we- we've talked we don't want to live anywhere near here because the school system is in such dire straits you know and we've talked about private schools an option or you know even maybe potentially home schooling even though that's got a whole 

466.17 467.06 A: (( but right )) 

469.51 473.44 B: [laughter] barrel of problems associated with it if you don't do it right too so 

471.19 472.09 A: [laughter] 

472.95 474.44 A: definitely 

473.83 478.04 B: so i mean it's just which is hard to even consider because 

478.33 482.43 B: i think i turned out okay and i went to public school you know but 

480.95 482.63 A: right 

483.06 485.62 B: [sigh] so it's just frustrating 

484.49 488.87 A: yeah i thought about that when i i moved to new york and moved from the midwest and ah 

489.15 500.75 A: i thought when i first got here there would be no way i wanted to bring kids up and now i kind of think it'd be a great place because you know there's so much for the kids to see and the diversity and i mean you can educate them 

497.83 499.57 B: right 

500.73 508.74 A: out of school you know quite a bit bringing them places and but but then ah just ah the violence in the schools and the danger 

503.48 505.04 B: exactly 

509.06 510.41 A: (( i don't know right )) 

512.41 513.91 B: true true i mean this 

514.14 526.90 B: i haven't lived in portland my whole life i mean i'm relatively new here we you know i'm i'm from wyoming so i mean i [laughter] i'm from a smaller town environment and maybe that was part of the reason why i didn't see a problem with the school system then either was 

527.14 531.09 B: [sigh] you know it wasn't an issue it just was one of those things you know 

530.62 533.86 A: yeah yeah i came from minnesota where i mean er 

534.20 539.66 A: governments pretty liberal and ah there's a lot for education and schools are good 

540.46 544.64 A: probably the most liberal state ah well until was killed but 

544.97 546.68 B: (( good [laughter] )) 

545.82 547.01 A: it was 

547.96 551.31 A: yeah it was a g- you know there was a good education system there 

551.63 553.46 B: (( good )) 

554.24 556.93 A: i didn't i didn't think about it until a few years ago 

556.92 557.87 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

559.94 564.27 B: yeah definitely so yeah i think think there are some problems 

564.46 565.18 A: (( w- )) 

564.53 567.53 B: and i i wouldn't even know where to begin to have a fix it because um 

567.67 568.65 B: (( i don't know )) 

569.05 576.60 B: [sigh] you know there there's a movement here now that there there's another measure that they've ah a group has introduced and it's going to be up for vote here soon 

576.62 579.16 B: about providing some of the money that was cut they're 

579.40 589.20 B: kind of redistributing some of the money so that well maybe we can have a five day school week again and and try to get you know kids back in school where they belong instead of 

584.03 585.02 A: (( right right yeah )) 

589.45 591.45 B: you know doing what they're doing now because 

591.89 598.13 B: it's so scary i mean i kn- know people here that are teachers and you know they they have to work another job a second job and that's 

598.36 599.89 B: and that's just as dangerous because
