21.60 22.50 A: (( playing )) 

22.67 23.39 A: (( field )) 

23.52 27.01 A: (( and bringing equal- and bringing equality for )) 

29.34 43.60 B: (( about it i think it's an all right idea in theory but it doesn't really work because like if further if further um um um um um um um spaces out like the race gap because like it's like you hire someone just on their race but you should not even look at the race you should just strictly look at credentials you know what i mean [noise] well definitely everyone needs an equal chance but i think race shouldn't even be looked at in the situation because like if you really like race )) 

43.44 51.83 B: (( is like you should embrace the differences of race but not use it as like a way to like determine anything about the person like yes the color of the skin is different but what are the credentials )) 

52.21 59.23 B: (( involved well people will interpret it but i mean [mn] it shouldn't be it really shouldn't be at all i ))

67.64 69.33 B: (( but )) 

70.00 80.10 A: (( everyone's the same opportunities that there should be some type of consideration given to a person who had been left out or disenfranchised )) 

80.54 87.87 A: (( over a period of time in no way shape or form do i think compromise should be made on the basis of quality but certainly we should take )) 

87.88 90.83 A: (( every effort possible )) 

90.64 93.41 B: (( of course there will be people )) 

93.81 99.41 B: (( that will look at it and see it but i mean for me personally it really really )) 

100.71 102.68 A: (( to make )) 

103.21 106.68 A: (( sure that each person has a leveled opportunity )) 

107.08 112.73 A: (( for participation well the one question i always ask people is to give )) 

113.15 117.55 A: (( me an example where race is not interpreted in america in any aspect of life well )) 

117.53 127.44 B: (( doesn't make a difference what the race is at all mhm well that's a good point um [sigh] hm well i mean it is it is sort of like about like equal participation um i mean i'm not really )) 

127.68 133.46 B: (( sure on how to comment to that um 'cause i mean i really just think that people need to stop like )) 

133.51 142.20 B: (( using race as a way to judge people because like this is not really a way to judge people at all it's just like it's such it's like comparing someone like with brown )) 

142.43 143.46 B: hair 

143.32 144.26 A: (( i think )) 

144.11 144.86 B: (( to )) 

145.11 147.16 B: (( blond )) 

147.20 148.79 B: (( hair or like )) 

148.86 149.75 B: (( brown )) 

150.02 151.46 B: eyes to blue 

151.68 158.10 B: (( eyes you know it's just it's different physically but it's not different in like the inert )) 

158.56 165.80 B: (( sense like you've everyone has like pretty much the same brain capacity it's how much they put into it you know what i mean )) 

166.54 168.04 A: (( that there are people who )) 

168.13 172.86 A: (( are open and honest and who )) 

173.77 179.20 A: (( embrace the theory of inclusion but the practicality in the society )) 

179.68 180.75 A: (( where )) 

182.09 185.89 A: (( we live it certainly is a clear )) 

187.40 188.52 A: (( cut society in )) 

188.86 190.24 A: (( terms of things )) 

192.29 200.31 A: (( being in black and white we [mn] even have laws that people say are strictly in black and white and we also notice that when you )) 

200.49 201.86 A: (( have areas where there are gray )) 

201.74 211.76 A: (( terms they tend to really kick up a lot of dust so i think that we want the ultimate goal should be move to move to a society of total inclusion but until that time we certainly do need laws to ensure that each )) 

211.61 217.51 A: (( and every person who has been historically disenfranchised is allowed to participate in an equal manner [noise] )) 

217.96 224.43 B: well that certainly is a way of looking at it but again 

224.46 237.83 B: we have to look at exactly what's happening in terms of the society where we live and right now we're confronted we're probably in one of the most divisive period of times that we've been into 

237.92 240.49 B: since early jim croweism 

240.72 244.30 B: if you look across the board in terms of education 

244.35 259.04 B: and how clearly we have schools that were supposed to be integrated but if you look at all the research and current reports schools are more segregated now than they ever were before and the old 

259.15 260.14 B: adage 

260.30 268.82 B: of separate but not equal is even more pronounced especially when you look in urban and rural quarters [lipsmack] corridors 

267.11 268.29 A: (( [noise] well )) 

268.84 269.74 A: um 

270.07 279.53 A: [cough] i me personally as like a white um adolescent i went to a school that was um majority african american 

279.85 287.97 A: so i sort of have like i guess maybe a different way of being raised as i feel no difference between 

287.97 299.90 A: me being white and other people being black but surely like things like things like that group segregation and whatnot have caused others to sort of uh feel differently about the race 

299.68 312.18 B: and you know it's the sad part of this is it that it's not in the hands of the every day people who you and i may come in contact but there are people who we don't know or even speak their names 

312.49 323.93 B: a- at all because they're not part of our scope and vision and certainly not a everyday part of our life that make these decisions and set up these parameters within society 

323.77 332.87 B: that causes it to operate in the manner in which it does i'm sure that you or your parents have never instituted the policy of red lining 

333.10 337.42 B: i'm sure that you or your parents have never been actively involved 

337.28 344.66 B: in terms of disenfranchising people politically i'm sure that you or your parents would never engage 

344.52 356.40 B: in bills that would make it impossible for certain schools in certain areas to receive the same resources as other however these are things that do actively happen 

356.37 360.05 B: in america each and every day and we have to keep that in mind 

360.49 363.07 A: yes yes i agree like 

363.40 373.21 A: my opinion on affirmative action does not represent exactly how like corporate america would go about the hiring and firing of individuals like um 

365.79 366.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

373.25 382.85 A: exact like my personal opinion really doesn't mean anything to corporate america and how you know they would they would completely like certain individuals 

382.68 391.27 A: would judge on race but personally i feel that that's completely like it's it's like it's it's rubbish you can't 

391.64 396.87 A: bu- people are raised the wrong way where like they feel completely segregated 

396.84 411.29 A: away from someone of the opposite race just because of like they've never been around someone or they've only had bad experiences with someone of the opposite race [mn] which is like where reverse racism just like like blacks against whites or whites against blacks it just keeps it like perpetuates 

411.36 412.39 A: um 

412.60 415.53 A: the way things are going when like really 

416.00 424.82 A: [sigh] people just need to realize that it is not that big of a difference but people can't realize that but i think eventually people will like over time it's just a slow process 

424.44 427.49 B: mhm oh uh i think i think so 

427.38 437.40 B: i think that we're going to move in a new era as a matter of fact if you are familiar with what's actually happening in urban corridors across america 

437.27 442.78 B: you have things that you have a movement called neighbourhood transformation initiative 

442.67 452.40 B: in which it's a re-migration back into urban areas of people who were once suburbanites and it's a remigration because of economical 

452.56 464.73 B: demands and i think that once you begin to see that happen that you will begin to see a different shift because not only is there a racial tinge in america but there is a class tinge 

464.26 466.67 A: oh definitely agreed completely 

466.72 471.29 A: um like just in cities like it feels like no one lives 

471.75 485.46 A: in cities anymore it's become like an incredibly african american place and like people shouldn't be like that people are like afraid of cities and things like that and afraid of like this african american community but i feel completely like [mn] 

485.47 491.12 A: we need to just come back together and like the suburbs are completely a bad idea man you know what i mean 

490.79 494.11 B: [noise] but it seems as though for all that fear 

494.12 502.32 B: urban universities are the ones who are becoming the land masters and who are revitalizing the cities and making them 

502.24 509.54 B: appealing to their faculty and to students that they want to attract into their institutions mhm 

509.62 511.19 A: oh yes agreed 

512.19 513.07 A: well 

513.51 515.09 A: (( hm )) 

516.04 516.80 A: it's 

516.98 522.15 A: i have recently lived in washington d._c. which is a predominantly black area and like 

522.34 535.87 A: um it feels like yes institutions have brought a lot back to the community and things like that but uh and i i really haven't seen a lot of like segregation in like hiring of people it just feels like they hire 

536.08 539.71 A: you know like who they feel will work best within 

540.10 541.41 A: the um 

542.04 544.77 A: the working environment [noise] [noise] 

544.86 550.35 B: well i work in a university and you know i do have more 

550.67 558.35 B: uh intact in terms of seeing people who are overlooked for various positions 

558.32 567.61 B: and it's only it has nothing to do with their qualifications or their skills but it has everything to do with the type of people that they want to propagate 

568.04 569.52 B: [noise] the um 

570.32 571.83 B: the information 

572.17 586.30 B: you know that uh they want to get out so it's it's a big gap it's a big gap and and it's also a very disparaging gap especially when you look at people who are even younger than we are who are coming along 

586.35 589.70 B: and trying to anticipate just what their future will be 

590.63 595.56 A: well [mn] i believe that this will all come to an end eventually because 

595.58 599.89 A: like as like people can i i personally s
