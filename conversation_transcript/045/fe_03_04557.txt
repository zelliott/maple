261.16 261.96 B: (( i don't )) 

262.21 265.34 B: know i we didn't hear it so i know i think um

269.91 277.00 B: no she said she was talking really fast [noise] and the la- the first call it got you know [sigh] they really um 

277.11 281.20 B: sat there and said what you know the topic was and whatever [noise] 

281.83 286.38 B: so i don't know what was going on this time [laughter] she was moving too fast 

284.52 285.22 A: (( yes )) 

286.92 296.61 A: yeah too strange [sigh] but they do care a lot about what kind of phone are you using which is kind of a strange i mean the participate in things like focal groups and stuff 

296.47 297.40 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

296.64 307.92 A: but they they don't care about where you're talking from and what kind of connection or what what are you using in fact they they just care about well you just let her know what you think but [sigh] if they ask 

308.25 316.17 A: about if you have the cell which is kind of a strange i thought they would be doing some sort of uh phone devices study or something 

316.01 325.62 B: yeah [noise] i'm not really sure what you know to make of it when we don't hear it they should you know they have that one number they'll let you can call back 

325.74 328.84 B: and talk to somebody i guess when they enroll you 

328.70 331.42 B: you can call that number back too 'cause they said 

331.28 345.52 B: if you have any complaints or like being on hold too long or if someth- you know [sigh] i'm thinking after we sit here for ten minutes and we hear the little beep [sigh] you know i can call back to that number [sigh] just to see 

345.39 346.35 B: you know 

346.48 357.72 B: if we would have to do our second call over or not you know because we didn't hear the topic [sigh] that's our problem i mean it's not like we're not willing to talk about the topic we just don't know what we're supposed to talk about 

351.91 353.57 A: (( right )) 

358.02 367.93 A: i see yeah [mn] completely and in fact if they listen to the conversation they would realize what's going on anyway [laughter] hope they will realize that for sure [laughter] 

363.56 366.25 B: [sigh] so yeah they w- i hope so [laughter] 

366.62 372.90 B: [sigh] but hopefully or else they just let us talk for ten minutes and tell us oh well you didn't talk about the topic [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

371.84 383.71 A: yeah and it's that's not i mean yeah i guess that as long as we sort of meet the the the timeline that uh they gave us they should be listening to the conversation later and they will figure out that their 

382.19 383.42 B: yeah 

383.79 385.31 A: their computer is the 

384.34 387.04 B: well i'm hoping they realize that you know

388.65 389.60 B: yeah 

390.29 391.25 A: i mean 

390.40 400.01 B: i hope they realize that we wasn't just pl- you know [laughter] forget it we don't want to talk about what they're talking about we'll just talk about whatever [laughter] 

393.84 394.94 A: (( if that's )) 

397.13 401.28 A: right [laughter] it's not our fault it's like your fault guys you're just

402.11 402.88 A: (( oh )) 

403.27 404.96 B: yeah 

404.53 405.60 A: that's strange 

405.00 407.82 B: so i don't know i'm thinking maybe after the little beep 

408.33 411.36 B: [noise] we'll know if it was successful or not i don't know 

411.82 413.09 A: would it be like a 

413.81 414.79 B: (( [noise] huh )) 

414.45 415.29 A: would it 

415.33 419.85 A: oh yeah last time it was a this little beep saying like thirty seconds say bye 

419.42 422.20 B: [noise] yeah [laughter] 

420.89 423.53 A: (( enjoyed yourself oh yeah )) 

423.97 426.40 B: [noise] that's the only thing i can think of [noise] 

428.10 429.32 A: (( it's it's strange )) 

429.72 433.65 B: yeah [noise] so i i wish i would have got the topic so 

433.89 436.11 A: so do i but i well 

434.96 437.82 B: (( [noise] 'cause it probably would have been interesting [noise] )) 

438.64 442.03 A: [sigh] but again it's no nobody's fault on this one [sigh] 

442.31 443.51 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

445.05 449.24 B: they'll give us another chance [laughter] like hopefully [laughter] 

448.51 454.43 A: oh they will keep they they will call again i do you think do you think they have too many persons enrolled this 

454.84 456.51 A: not sure [laughter] 

456.03 457.14 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

457.41 469.84 A: do you know uh which city was that person who you want to talk the first time do do you know where which city was uh i mean the person the one who talk you talked the first time do you know where that person was calling from 

461.30 462.31 B: huh 

468.80 476.48 B: [noise] [noise] [sigh] when i when i talked the first person i talked to was calling from um [noise] new jers- was was from new jersey [noise] 

477.10 483.73 A: and you're in seattle the first person i talked to was in san diego you see all the way down in california so 

481.02 482.28 B: oh really 

484.87 490.39 A: trying to see if there is something else we can sort of figure out from the locations [laughter] 

489.68 490.61 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

490.71 498.77 B: yeah i'm thinking they're probably trying to hook people up that you know are from all kinda different areas to see 

498.86 501.55 B: if they agree or disagree on that issue 

501.87 504.46 B: you know from different areas or you know 

504.92 506.44 B: (( that's you know )) 

507.12 516.94 A: but yeah this this one but th- they the the topics themselves sounded so unrelated like the first one that we had to talk about was related with perjury 

516.87 518.14 B: oh okay 

517.98 527.45 A: and if you [mn] if you were willing to commit perjury for a relative or something like that or for someone in fact and it yeah and we talked about it and we it was like 

522.75 523.94 B: oh really 

527.29 535.76 A: well i you [sigh] you have to think about who is a person to if i would be doing that but this one was like 

531.87 533.10 B: yeah 

533.47 534.22 B: (( [sigh] so )) 

534.69 537.70 B: yeah my first topic was on um 

537.90 540.39 B: what i thought was more import- what 

541.25 544.83 B: i thought was more important to [noise] um 

545.20 559.68 B: stay alive i mean what issue would i think that was to be more important to keep myself alive [sigh] um smoking health [sigh] losing weight and it was like a multiple choice thing you know we had to 

559.65 566.95 B: put it what order we thought they came in and elaborated [noise] on that [sigh] you know what will kill you the fastest [noise] 

567.75 568.65 A: (( got you )) 

569.63 577.26 A: i mean the still all this sort of polemic things are you you really have to discuss on so i think that even though we we didn't get the topic 

577.05 578.06 B: yeah 

577.48 583.63 A: and yet we just kept talking so they just figure out i guess they want to they want to measure something 

580.80 583.67 B: yeah i hope they figure it out 

583.75 595.64 B: i hope they figure out or i hope they don't just you know [sigh] go by that we stayed on the phone ten minutes you know i'm thinking [noise] they would at least listen to the call [sigh] and realize that we didn't [noise] neither one of us heard the topic 

595.26 596.28 A: yeah 

595.70 597.42 B: [laughter] so hope 

596.35 599.89 A: well or you know what what sort of thing they might think that they might be doing
