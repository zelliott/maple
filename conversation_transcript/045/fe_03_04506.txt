0.08 1.77 B: hello i'm kim 

1.66 3.93 A: hello kim my name is dan 

3.96 5.63 B: hi dan nice to meet you 

5.47 6.63 A: okay 

6.75 9.28 B: so what do you think of the public school system [lipsmack] 

10.37 24.33 A: yeah they're definitely in need of some of some help but it's not only the system itself it's you have to look at the the school and the area that the school is in such as inner city 

24.64 26.55 A: then you have a number of 

26.75 29.19 A: students who really don't want to learn 

30.55 36.63 B: oh i think there are also a lot of students that just don't feel inspired to learn because of circumstances 

37.45 39.65 B: i don't know if i would agree that 

41.12 45.02 B: it has to do with the a lot of students that don't want to learn 

44.97 53.89 A: no not all there are just some there are some who really do want to learn but yeah the majority are only going to be there to take up space 

55.04 59.60 A: and maybe because they can't stay home but there are 

59.69 64.89 A: entirely too many distractions but that's at the home itself that as far as the school system 

65.25 69.87 A: ah they could use their energies in ah some sort of 

69.96 71.53 A: there's no question 

71.52 72.51 B: mhm 

72.51 77.35 A: each school could have a needs to have computers in every classroom 

78.06 79.11 B: yeah 

79.49 86.00 B: i saw a show one time about um kids at are very wealthy 

86.02 98.35 B: school it was a public school with um a very wealthy neighborhood that supplied most of the children and a lot of the teachers were bitter about the fact that the kids were driving better cars than they were and 

90.31 91.36 A: mhm 

97.78 98.87 A: (( mhm )) 

98.35 102.62 B: i don't think teachers get paid enough a lot of times i mean 

102.90 104.64 A: no they don't 

104.59 106.85 B: if we're entrusting them with 

107.14 108.68 B: breeding the 

108.97 112.18 B: tomorrow's you know adults then 

112.97 117.41 B: i think that they deserve a lot more money than they're getting right now 

117.29 118.58 A: sure they do 

118.63 120.54 A: and more recognition [noise] 

120.46 125.90 B: recognition and definitely resources for teaching 

126.17 127.87 B: such as computers 

127.66 132.90 A: right and also the preparation does begin in the household i think if 

132.89 146.07 A: the parent doesn't take a ah more active role in what their child is learning in school i think that child's going to grow up to be especially with his the distractions that are out there for 

146.44 148.44 B: yeah it 

148.59 156.24 B: but really the public school system doesn't have much control over that unfortunately well no i mean fortunately but 

148.85 149.43 A: (( him )) 

154.18 155.73 A: unfortunately 

156.27 157.28 B: um 

158.08 161.07 B: there's only so much that the school system can do 

161.02 162.86 A: that's absolutely right 

162.25 165.93 B: but i certainly don't think that it's doing as much as it can do 

166.90 168.00 A: (( mm )) 

169.09 170.21 B: i think that 

169.41 172.07 A: yeah yeah i'm sorry go ahead 

171.48 173.33 B: i was going to say i think that 

173.92 175.91 B: it would be possible for 

176.11 179.37 B: to put kids on a a more positive environment 

179.04 180.96 A: mhm okay 

181.59 183.59 B: than breeding 

184.61 188.91 B: fear and i don't know all the schools that have 

189.72 193.12 B: metal detectors and stuff like that 

193.93 197.42 A: yeah and unfortunately it's come to that 

197.47 200.13 A: because ah the inner city 

197.51 198.54 B: yeah 

200.47 202.46 A: children for 

202.96 205.29 A: used to hearing gunshots 

205.49 215.62 A: and they can tell you about the latest rap song and all the latest rap artist but when you ask them okay who was the sixteenth president of the u._s. 

215.49 216.29 B: (( [laughter] )) 

216.97 220.72 A: they wouldn't know and half of them wouldn't care 

220.87 232.96 A: and if the well they are they're really into their mode of dress there's such a who's got the latest calvin klein on and ah the latest michael jordan sneakers 

232.37 233.65 B: yeah 

233.80 238.10 B: i certainly don't think that school uniforms would really be a bad idea at all 

238.21 242.46 A: no i have to agree that i like the uniform idea myself 

242.97 248.12 B: i mean i believe in in kids expressing their individuality but 

248.77 250.08 B: i think that 

250.28 255.73 B: competition should be reduced at least in that sense i don't think that 

254.82 255.38 A: (( [mn] )) 

256.47 257.53 A: mhm 

256.85 262.61 B: kids who can't afford to to dress as nice as some kids should have to go to school and feel 

262.81 264.27 B: bad about it 

264.23 265.68 A: that's true 

264.77 266.44 B: or embarrassed 

266.71 268.48 A: that's also true 

269.35 274.52 B: i think it's important to put all the kids on as equal of a footing as possible 

274.54 276.28 A: mhm 

277.56 287.01 A: well and it also comes down to maybe um because they're building some a new school over in ah where is that around 

287.18 291.56 A: i believe okay that might be something 

290.91 292.01 B: (( [lipsmack] where )) 

291.93 293.47 A: front and lee high 

293.58 295.00 B: where's that 

294.82 297.36 A: (( ah that's in )) 

297.81 300.21 A: like kensington area 

300.45 302.83 B: i'm sorry i'm chicago where are you oh 

302.23 305.01 A: oh oh okay i'm in philadelphia 

304.79 305.95 B: okay 

305.91 311.94 A: all right oh okay so anyway um they're building a new school there 

309.56 310.28 B: [laughter] 

311.57 312.84 B: mhm 

312.62 313.97 A: (( and um )) 

314.96 325.81 A: well it depends on are the students going to go for it i mean like it more than likely it'll have air conditioning i don't know how the school system is there in chicago if you guys 

325.90 330.08 A: have ah new schools but in philly a lot of these 

330.28 337.82 A: are a hundred years old most of them and they're very hot in the summertime believe me 

332.57 333.54 B: mhm 

337.34 339.59 B: really they don't have air conditioning 

338.32 341.46 A: oh yeah not all of them 

340.87 342.66 B: that's terrible 

342.30 348.18 A: that's right the newer schools of course they have air conditioning the older buildings no they don't 

347.95 349.05 B: wow 

349.06 351.09 B: i can't imagine that's awful 

349.37 350.04 A: (( yeah )) 

350.88 352.47 A: oh yeah 

352.69 354.94 B: i didn't go to school here but 

356.63 361.33 B: i i didn't even know that they still really had schools especially in a large city 

361.22 363.00 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

361.69 363.73 B: that wasn't air conditioned 

363.20 365.86 A: oh yeah definitely welcome to philly 

364.29 367.42 B: well at least the kids aren't in school in the summertime [laughter] 

367.28 374.10 A: oh no for the most part but if there's a heat wave like starting tomorrow 

367.68 368.94 B: for the most part 

373.95 375.04 B: really 

374.19 380.87 A: and they're yeah well i don't know no there's not going to be a heat wave starting tomorrow but hypothetically speaking if there were 

379.70 380.75 B: (( oh okay )) 

381.47 384.55 A: then the there they they would be sweating 

385.03 387.78 B: yeah that's that's terrible 

387.53 389.98 A: that is s- also true 

390.66 393.08 B: yeah and i i don't think 

393.18 407.06 B: i know that when the air conditioners went out at work i've always felt extremely uncomfortable and in the summertime one time it got up to like a hundred and two degrees inside where i was working i work in a photo lab so 

397.05 398.28 A: (( mhm )) 

399.29 400.53 A: mhm 

406.46 408.47 A: (( mhm )) 

407.45 411.68 B: we had actually put ice in the machines [laughter] to keep the 

411.96 419.18 B: the chemicals at the right temperatures and and i just thought i was going to pass out i can't imagine 

417.56 418.71 A: okay 

420.37 423.18 B: trying to learn in an environment like that 

423.55 425.13 B: it's really terrible 

423.80 424.84 A: yeah 

424.96 433.11 A: yeah it is and ah the attention span ah of some of them ha- do have attention deficit disorder and ah 

433.27 436.05 A: teachers can only do so much for the child 

436.51 437.72 A: (( and )) 

438.56 445.07 A: if the work they're doing is still not enough then i don't know what more then that that a teacher can do 

446.23 454.89 A: because like you were saying the metal detector deals and the i don't know how it is there in chicago but it's nothing to hear about ah 

455.32 461.51 A: somebody here in philly getting shot in school they can still get a weapon in if they want to 

461.51 462.45 B: yeah 

462.93 463.86 A: so 

464.30 469.84 A: and yeah they don't always check everybody that comes through the metal detector 

464.34 465.76 B: yeah 

469.53 470.55 B: mhm 

470.46 474.04 A: the contention for them is oh that would take too long 

474.27 481.34 A: all right so if it's going to take too long that extra minute or five minutes may save somebody's life 

482.42 485.55 A: and it could be your life that's going to be saved 

484.98 486.02 B: mhm 

486.14 497.52 A: so ah of course i don't agree with that idea that well we'll check every fifth or sixth student to come through and the others can hurry on to class 

498.10 500.86 B: yeah it's it's a tough call i mean 

498.13 499.47 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

501.38 510.31 B: but also being checked every day to go into school just probably already puts kids not in such a positive m- mood 

510.09 519.21 A: mhm yeah it would do that for me because all right i've got to go to school and i've got to get go through the metal detector 

519.52 521.74 B: yeah it's almost like going to prison [laughter] 

521.29 522.69 A: exactly 

523.94 531.68 A: so how else w- they can improve the school district and ah they public schools but ah i mean when that's going to happen 

532.65 537.33 A: influence of more dollars from the state and also the 

537.50 538.74 A: the government 

538.74 540.38 B: yes i agree 

541.08 543.03 A: (( and you know like we're yeah )) 

541.12 551.80 B: and i think that a lot i think in many schools a lot more money than really should be is is spent on things like sports and 

551.10 552.78 A: (( mhm )) 

552.71 558.26 B: i think sports are good and it's important for children to be active but it does seem time 

558.53 560.04 B: i don't think that 

560.20 564.82 B: as much money as seems to get put into that kind of stuff 

565.03 567.56 B: is really appropriate when there are 

567.99 570.07 B: other more 

570.43 573.02 B: educational needs at hand 

572.91 574.21 A: mhm 

576.05 577.59 A: (( exactly )) 

577.60 585.79 A: and ah how many i don't i forget how much it's costing per day but it's still a lot of money 

585.56 586.94 B: (( oh yes )) 

586.87 592.94 A: now some of that money could be funneled and kept right here to 

593.67 596.51 A: (( further m- that black kid that's ah )) 

596.69 599.89 A: five or six years old now can be start to
