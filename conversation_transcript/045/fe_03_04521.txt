85.58 89.04 B: ah the later on schools did 

88.36 90.50 A: uh-huh what about the early schools

123.03 123.69 A: (( mm )) 

126.16 127.46 A: (( mhm )) 

129.39 133.26 A: i can understand why if you were a teacher would you want green lights 

130.96 132.27 B: (( ah )) 

133.61 135.45 B: would i want a green light 

134.90 136.65 A: if you were a teacher

144.32 154.58 B: twelve year olds all buttoned up all day long specially when she's got no kids at ah ah siblings to talk with at home 

153.96 160.03 A: uh-huh i agree with you and i think what's p- the problem now is also that the classrooms are so large 

160.06 165.80 A: and that they're not paying enough for the teachers to get decent teachers to come in who want to teach 

165.47 166.53 B: yeah 

165.90 170.91 A: because ah i mean e- i live in florida and we have the s. camps and they're 

170.94 174.73 A: just saying that the kids are not doing well with these scores 

171.59 172.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

174.75 177.50 A: so something is wrong somewhere down the line 

177.60 181.92 B: well in texas they ta- can have it's one thing call task 

182.04 191.72 B: and ah ah they take in they have to take in you know pass this test that's teachers are rated for their accountability 

188.19 189.15 A: (( mhm )) 

191.07 192.17 A: right 

192.11 193.89 B: and ah 

193.93 201.14 B: ah i hear too often that the teachers teach the test instead of teaching the subject 

201.12 203.19 A: they're more concerned about their own 

203.32 204.59 B: right 

203.88 205.23 A: ratings 

204.64 206.54 B: right 

205.89 220.60 A: ah i i don't know but i know with i grad i went to the new york public schools i grew up in the new york public schools and at that time we went we had basic reading writing and arithmetic and i think we're losing sight of a lot of that stuff 

220.62 222.44 B: i think you're correct 

221.83 234.82 A: and a lot of the i think also the fact that we just don't the the school systems are so broke they have no money that the kids are losing out on the arts and the sci- you know the extra curricular activities which is a shame 

234.73 235.95 B: yeah 

235.31 246.68 A: i mean how are you going to grow up without knowing anything about art and music and you know the the arts and this is where i think we're we're losing a lot of the ah it's just terrible 

246.75 260.67 B: i don't remember my daughter doing a whole lot of artsy craftsy stuff in ah high school or school but ah she ah has a real good appreciation for the arts now i don't know where she got it from but she dug it up her own 

260.17 270.10 A: [mn] well you know a lot of it we blame a lot of these things on the school systems or expect them to do everything for us but i think a lot of it also has to be done at the home 

263.35 263.99 B: (( [noise] )) 

269.80 270.81 B: yeah i've 

270.10 276.50 A: you know if you take your child to the museum or to the operas or to the ballets or to the theater or whatever 

276.53 286.76 A: they're going to learn somewhere along the line you know that these things at least exist to the museum they have to know these things exist it's part of our daily lives 

281.72 282.56 B: yeah 

286.76 300.66 B: yeah you know w- we never did that but my daughter's been to the kimball museum here in fort worth and um she goes to she was to the criminal museum in rottenburg last weekend 

288.95 289.80 A: uh-huh 

291.86 292.76 A: uh-huh 

300.06 302.62 A: oh how interesting what is she doing in germany 

302.53 304.42 B: (( she works for lika )) 

304.57 317.09 B: and ah she works in the united states ma- ah mostly but sh- ah she takes they have a machine where they married a a microscope and a computer together and ah 

308.18 309.05 A: uh-huh 

316.98 322.73 B: she is responsible for that machine to customers in the united states 

322.41 324.85 A: and where did she go to schoo- to college 

324.38 329.77 B: she went to she got a physics degree at u._t._a. ah arlington ah a 

329.08 331.09 A: a physics degree wow 

330.54 332.26 B: physics degree yeah 

331.36 332.35 A: uh-huh 

332.62 335.46 B: and she's done real well with it she's 

334.82 338.61 A: so i guess then the public school and she went to public school the ah 

337.77 348.78 B: she went to public school she after she got past elementary school ah where she got to junior school and they ah there was more freedom and they let them go to lunch 

344.24 345.03 A: (( mhm )) 

349.11 350.08 B: and [noise] 

349.27 356.61 A: well i also feel that my children went to public schools as well ah i lived in ohio at the time and then ah 

355.12 355.72 B: (( [noise] )) 

356.83 359.12 A: it was a small town but i felt that 

359.47 368.04 A: even if if the even though it was a small town that if they applied themselves you know the children themselves if they applied themselves that 

368.13 370.12 A: at least they had a chance 

370.16 384.29 A: you know they can't depend everything on the teachers and everything at the home they had to give a little bit of themselves as well they had to work hard for their grades and not just say well you know i'm just going to go through ah through school just you know on lick and a prayer 

384.02 391.43 B: i guess my wife did the best thing possible for her when she was just a little girl just able to sign her name sue 

391.75 395.00 B: ah took her to the library and got her a card 

394.41 395.66 A: (( mhm )) 

395.44 399.60 B: and ah she took and learned to love to read 

399.01 401.19 A: well this is it and this is where 

401.13 414.75 A: the schools have to go back to the basics with the reading writing arithmetic and stress you know reading because so many of the kids today can't read and i think a lot of the kids or a lot of the schools also put a lot of emphasis on sports 

414.96 415.96 A: and 

415.38 418.20 B: away in texas they do way too much 

417.54 424.49 A: yes even down here and a lot of the kids really aren't can't even you know do anything scholastically 

424.26 434.42 A: but as long as they can play football or whatever they you know the schools are willing to take them and that's a shame they should be able to earn that honor to be able to play on the team 

426.56 427.42 B: yeah 

433.93 438.23 B: everyone of them wants ah thinks they're going to be a professional ballplayer and ma- 

437.29 438.64 A: that's right 

438.29 440.11 B: billions of dollars 

439.51 449.37 A: but the schools are and encourage it as well because the school gets lots of money for it and that's not right the school should not do that the school should make the student be able to 

449.57 457.48 A: to ba- you know to to pass the basics without ah saying well he's just an athlete he has to be a ah student as well 

458.40 463.72 B: yeah they helped my daughter you know she's a really smart girl in fact she's a member of m._e._n._s._a. 

463.32 464.99 A: oh that's wonderful 

464.56 472.43 B: and ah you know so she but she's she's got the ability to read quickly and to comprehend what she's read 

471.81 476.64 A: well i think the schools have done a fair job i think they can do a lot better 

476.65 487.58 A: ah if we put more emphasis back to as i say when i grew up back to the the three rs so to speak and stop worrying about ah [cough] all these scores and 

483.66 484.22 B: (( [mn] )) 

487.51 498.86 A: and go back and give these kids a lot of ah more ah extra curricular activities and more in the arts and the theaters and you know give them an appreciation for all these things 

498.56 513.21 B: right extra curricular activities is exactly that extra you know and if they're doing okay for you know in their like you say their three rs ah then you know then they can ah go off and ah do that other stuff but 

507.92 509.02 A: (( mhm )) 

512.60 516.33 A: that's right but they have to have the three rs first you can't ah 

516.26 529.85 A: keep promoting them if they don't have the basics because they're going to get lost down the road it's if you don't have the basics you know beginning of the first and second grades and then you send them off to high school and these kids can't read and write it's a disgrace 

520.85 522.13 B: right 

528.31 539.63 B: what i see um is ah kids coming out of school is that a lot of them don't have the work ethic and i don't think that's something you can teach in school that's something that comes from the home 

534.37 535.74 A: exactly 

538.97 552.06 A: that's right absolutely that's why i say the school can do x. amount but i think the family in the home has to contribute and add the rest of it it can't we cannot leave it all up to the teachers because the teachers only have them 

543.21 544.05 B: right 

552.01 561.67 A: you know so many d- hours a day and then they go on to the next hour you know the next ah grades and everything but the home has to play a very important part as well 

561.52 568.54 A: and i think that's where a lot of it i think because so many parents work two jobs now that they don't have the time to devote to the child 

568.83 571.65 A: it's a you know money's ah situation 

571.62 574.45 B: maybe that's why we only had an only child 

574.36 576.69 A: yeah and you were able to give for her 

576.34 577.71 B: yeah 

577.06 581.43 A: but ah it seems that she did well with the public schools ah 

581.31 584.28 B: after she got the p- in the junior high 

583.89 584.86 A: mhm 

584.19 589.14 B: ah when she first started out in elementary when we moved from minnesota 

588.93 599.89 B: ah she had three as and three bs and ah slipped ah ah by the time she got we didn't find about the red light green light yellow light and oh um 

591.53 592.86 A: oh that's good 

598.43 599.47 A: (( mhm ))
