26.48 27.54 A: yeah 

26.85 36.51 B: yeah i i mean i kinda like both but i probably tend to like the staying home because then you can you know you can do everything at your own pace [sigh] 

36.24 37.36 A: right 

36.70 44.65 B: and it takes actually so much money it's like going out to do the whole movie thing it's a whole experience 

41.98 43.23 A: mhm 

43.14 57.38 A: yeah it does and it's a lot cheaper [sigh] and a lot of movie places around here they have like a buy one and get one free or you can keep 'em for more than one night so that helps 'cause you can watch them more than once and when you go to the movies it's like so many other people are around you so right 

51.19 52.21 B: yeah 

53.65 54.48 B: (( [sigh] and )) 

56.72 67.73 B: exactly and if you don't really like it you you didn't really pay like ten bucks or you know even though some movie theaters are a little bit cheaper now but [sigh] you don't feel like you know i've wasted a whole 

67.70 72.68 B: night going out and then i really didn't enjoy this movie 

71.56 76.08 A: yeah i know it is expensive i don't understand why they make it so expensive [sigh] 

75.61 80.23 B: and you don't have to deal with like people like over talking and all that stuff you know

98.24 112.33 B: they said that they didn't really enjoy it 'cause it was kind of like the same as before but i mean that's kind of the theme it's like you know a big block buster special effects action so i just went in there [mn] thinking that i'm just going to go see some [sigh] really cool [sigh] 

106.59 107.39 A: (( mhm )) 

112.59 118.58 B: fighting scenes and and that type of thing and it that served its purpose i didn't get it in

118.64 120.29 B: but that was that 

120.77 129.18 B: yeah now that i enjoy seeing in a theater 'cause you have the whole [sigh] like it's almost like a ride you know 

128.24 130.27 A: right it is 

129.97 144.92 B: but um i mean if i would have missed it like it i've seen s- some things that i've saw on on tape that you know i wa- wished i would have seen in the theater but [sigh] you know i said a couple of ones i'll go out and see just that and x. men is the only one that i've that i've seen recently how about you

178.78 180.91 B: it's really good too okay 

187.61 188.95 B: wow [laughter] 

189.25 196.46 B: oh wow so it's really good no i'm so excited to see that everybody's telling me that that's really really [sigh] a good one

199.42 207.95 B: but um i i haven't yeah but the last things one of the things i did rent was i did rent um ghost ship and yeah it was it was kind of uh really bizarre 

199.52 200.70 A: (( i don't know )) 

207.56 210.28 A: yeah it was it was [sigh] 

210.49 216.96 A: it wasn't real i don't i mean it was kind of one of those that not like an old scary movie it's just but 

211.91 212.98 B: yeah 

215.60 225.50 B: right y- you know and [sigh] but yeah the luxuries that they compared to to to now everything is almost built to the fact that you almost don't have to leave your house 

225.03 226.77 A: mhm it's yeah 

225.48 231.21 B: i mean you can order anything off the computer or you know delivery service

234.27 234.99 A: (( mhm )) 

234.28 240.14 B: you know you can microwave popcorn which see is actually better now [laughter] than the stuff in the theater 

239.62 242.74 A: i know and that's stuff's so fattening though [laughter] 

240.24 244.08 B: that's been sitting there [sigh] for yes i know [laughter] 

243.21 249.21 A: i've heard it's like eating two steak dinners so i know that's my favorite the popcorn and i always get chocolate covered peanuts 

248.57 256.61 B: y- no you have to [laughter] people don't understand that's like part of the whole experience i'm i'm like that too i'm like i have to go to the concession stand 

250.39 251.25 A: [laughter] 

255.76 266.84 A: mhm the only thing about the movie theater though is you sit there and you and you have to get up and go to the rest room or you know you can't pause it and you kind of miss whole maybe if you're running late it's kind of 

257.29 258.11 B: but 

263.72 264.79 B: (( y- yeah )) 

265.76 278.56 B: that's true and you have to get there early like it's a whole plan like people there's like a movie etiquette you're right [sigh] you have to get there in enough time so you can try to go to the bathroom go to the concession stand get a good seat [sigh] 

267.02 267.99 A: (( you know )) 

276.30 277.07 A: (( [cough] )) 

278.24 279.49 A: mhm 

278.90 288.89 B: it's like a whole thing you know and i like previews 'cause i like to see what's coming up i mean for my whatever ten bucks i want to see everything [laughter] that's on the screen 

288.14 295.89 A: yeah that's true too i like the previews and you know when you're at home you can fast forward through those if you don't want to watch those and 

289.06 290.26 B: [laughter] 

293.56 296.91 B: right right [laughter] that's right exactly see 

296.18 308.73 A: but the thing about home is the uh dvds i've got a d._v._d. player and the ones that are made for the widescreen you know and they're like tiny on the t._v. it's like they're real long but they're real short do you know what i'm talking about 

301.68 302.85 B: (( yeah )) 

303.27 304.23 B: yes 

308.05 322.44 B: yes i do no i'm going to get into the d._v._d. my friend has it but it's almost like a mini theater because you you can get these cool speakers and and they have l- like surround sound on them and you have so many other cooler features like the extra footage and [sigh] 

317.97 319.20 A: mhm 

321.56 322.84 A: mhm 

322.22 330.09 B: all that stuff and then on the d._v._d.s you don't have to deal with like all those like um plugs for like the new t._v. show or whatever 

329.67 331.71 A: (( mhm i know )) 

330.44 343.33 B: so yeah i think as i get older i i'm more becoming more h- homebound interested you know what i mean and then going out sporadically like oh okay this movie i'll go see 

338.74 339.77 A: yeah 

343.15 344.04 A: mhm 

343.41 351.50 B: but but yeah i think i'm leaning towards uh trying to m- make everything available to me [laughter] in the privacy of my own home 

350.72 360.26 A: [sigh] i know it's like one day that maybe they had all the ops like kinda like the drive in i mean you know that was cool until people got t._v.s you know lots of t._v.s in their house and now it's 

354.74 356.36 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

359.68 360.64 B: yeah 

360.19 366.44 A: the movie theater and now people have the [sigh] big screen t._v.s that would do just as well if you have surround sound in it 

364.12 365.32 B: that's right 

365.71 374.95 B: that's right whole entertainment centers i i went to i think a drive in maybe maybe twice or three times when i was small and all i remember is getting a lot of mosquito bites

393.87 395.28 B: wow 

395.31 410.09 A: they uh it's it's so cheap you can watch two movies for like five bucks but i i've decided that they have to like cut the movies short for some reason because i don't see how they could do that [sigh] and the movies don't last as long i think they cut them down [laughter] i don't know if they get a cheaper version 

398.70 399.86 B: yeah 

409.76 411.04 B: wow 

411.10 412.65 A: or what happens

416.54 417.58 A: uh-huh 

416.88 429.76 B: i mean it's something like if somebody you know you hear your parents do it it's like kinda cool to like at least go and [sigh] and sit you know at a drive in but yeah um two movies back to back [sigh] that's uh [laughter] that's pretty long
