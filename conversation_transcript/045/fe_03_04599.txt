21.66 33.21 B: you know when you see i mean i saw two thousand one in the i._m._a._x. theater it was it was really uh the movie by itself is already i believe a masterpiece but when you see it in a big screen 

22.46 23.22 A: (( mhm )) 

33.26 45.99 B: it's really it make a difference i mean [laughter] so yes it's of course is more expensive to go to the movies but it's it's not the same but watch a video i don't i don't i don't believe you get the same same feeling 

45.95 47.03 A: right 

46.05 47.76 B: what do you think

69.19 70.07 A: uh-huh 

69.65 73.81 B: and uh you see i._m._a._x. go for it because is 

74.05 78.92 B: if you never experience it you don't know what i'm talking about it's really it's really like 

76.81 80.44 A: right you know i've seen it on t._v. so i do 

80.80 84.39 A: understand you know isn't it like two screens 

82.18 83.26 B: (( yeah it's )) 

84.23 88.64 B: no no no is an enormous screen like the uh building screen if you 

86.57 87.48 A: uh-huh 

87.74 88.73 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

88.82 94.99 B: so it's like if its three dimensional but at the same time you don't have to wear glasses 

94.84 104.34 B: which is kind of annoying sometimes but you get the you know the feeling of uh of three dimension you are really inside the movie kind of is is is tru- is 

102.39 105.09 A: oh i bet that is cool hey 

104.51 106.23 B: yeah it's really cool 

105.89 107.95 A: what movie did you see that way 

108.02 122.97 B: uh i s- they they don't do every movie for i._m._a._x. but they uh right now i want to see um ghost of the abyss but before that i saw something about sometimes documentary i saw something about the space shuttle 

111.71 112.83 A: mhm 

116.23 117.25 A: mhm 

122.74 123.65 A: uh-huh 

123.26 126.71 B: which was very interesting uh the grand canyon 

127.10 133.55 B: so uh and uh what else i i know m- i saw many but oh i saw fantasia two thousand 

133.15 134.41 A: oh wow 

133.38 144.46 B: (( you know the the the great yeah fantasia two thousand in in i._m._a._x. was really uh i really believe i studied three d. animation also i really belie- i mean )) 

135.25 136.34 A: the disney 

144.30 150.39 B: uh fantasia was really great as it is but in i._m._a._x. is all really spectacular so 

149.90 154.76 A: i can only imagine it it must feel like you're right in the movie 

151.52 152.84 B: (( yeah it was )) 

155.06 166.38 B: well actually i see too much movie in a way but uh you know [laughter] i have to i'm a dancer so um i enjoy dancing and do some other things i'm a teacher i'm a swing dancing teacher 

158.65 159.80 A: [laughter] 

160.96 161.82 A: oh 

166.13 167.62 A: oh wow 

166.60 168.09 B: and a tap teacher 

167.92 182.58 B: so i uh i enjoy probably more of these but um [lipsmack] uh sometimes uh you can uh i cannot uh go to musicals for example it's too expensive so it's easier to watch a movie right 

179.85 181.26 A: mhm 

182.20 183.25 A: right 

182.54 192.74 B: and uh yeah but my only problem with movies is difficult to find good movies because most of them is just violent and there's no story line 

188.57 189.54 A: uh-huh 

192.64 193.49 A: (( yeah )) 

193.17 194.69 B: you know but 

193.75 207.20 A: i agree with the violence it seems like everything's violent i've got two small children and i never realized how violent movies were until i don't want my little boys to see the people killing each other and stuff [sigh] 

195.29 196.80 B: yeah and it's 

197.21 198.26 B: yeah 

206.91 214.92 B: yeah and it's stupid too because we have enough violence in our lives without uh bring it uh violence as an entertainment 

214.43 215.88 A: exactly 

214.94 220.19 B: (( but uh even the news look at the news it's not objective )) 

220.16 221.17 A: right 

220.33 232.99 B: what people want to see basically is bad stuff and is what they they got you know uh even when you have a war in uh for example have a war in in iraq okay we know it's bad but to see this on every channel 

225.25 226.13 A: yeah 

233.01 235.08 A: every minute of every day [noise] 

233.37 234.24 B: does 

234.48 244.93 B: yeah it doesn't it doesn't bring anything because you get more depr- depressed and is what the terrorist want that you get uh you know depressed and that you change your lifestyle 

244.85 249.83 A: y- it does you know all those embedded reporters just drove me crazy 

245.77 246.92 B: yeah i 

249.47 251.10 B: yeah it's tha- 

250.17 254.53 A: it seemed like there was nothing else on t._v. but those that darn war 

254.24 261.23 B: yeah and you can you can't fight against against war against you know bad things if you are depressed 

260.91 261.82 A: (( yep )) 

261.25 274.16 B: so on the contrary watch i love lucy or read snoopy or i don't know what you want to do with it but i mean you know enjoy your life and [mn] for example if you have an earthquake you will see only the building 

265.41 266.58 A: [laughter] 

274.23 275.34 B: falling 

275.15 276.03 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

275.47 282.40 B: (( but they will never show the building which stand up and guess what the building falling is maybe one or or two percent of a )) 

282.21 295.72 B: of a b- building in a city so you think is everything everywhere is bad when you have an earthquake but in reality you have two people dead if you do the same thing in india you will have maybe two thousand and we don't talk about it [laughter] 

290.21 291.27 A: right 

293.40 294.30 A: yeah 

295.06 296.66 A: (( y- yeah )) 

295.78 298.92 B: (( so yeah unfortunately news )) 

299.16 307.65 B: (( news doesn't change your life except maybe when they tell you that uh not to eat this food or this food you know )) 

307.15 308.06 A: yeah 

307.75 314.21 B: like it's good to know or maybe for the weather if you need to go camping tomorrow you need more or less to know if it's uh 

312.16 313.12 A: (( [laughter] )) 

313.14 315.21 A: yeah the weather yeah 

314.59 322.71 B: yeah the weather but besides that it be educated by reading books and you get more of uh of your life as watching you know 

315.74 316.51 A: (( yeah )) 

321.14 328.14 A: yeah i believe people should stay informed but i don't think the news should take over people's lives 

327.61 328.98 B: yeah 

328.37 330.73 A: that's just like the o._j. simpson thing 

330.47 331.34 B: yes 

330.85 334.95 A: that trial people sat in front of that t._v. for months 

334.44 339.99 B: mhm yeah and it doesn't it doesn't do any- it become a drug and it doesn't change anything 

339.57 340.65 A: exactly 

339.81 349.48 B: so when we see movies is entertainment so choose your right entertainment and i don't think all that blood i mean for some people is entertaining i don't think so 

349.60 356.51 B: i mean for me doesn't work okay i need i need to see a movie or i will remember the movie in years to come 

351.67 352.51 A: right 

356.34 358.95 A: right what was the last movie you've seen 

357.04 357.77 B: (( so )) 

359.03 368.93 B: you know it's funny uh on the tongue on the bottom of my tongue i don't have the answer right oh yeah x. men i didn't choose it yeah i didn't choose it [laughter] because 

364.84 366.75 A: x. men yeah 

367.85 369.04 A: did you like it 

369.05 378.58 B: um well i it's okay but the guy's too violent and uh the story it's too much characters 

373.72 375.41 A: yeah yeah 

378.77 380.56 A: yeah you know 

379.67 390.87 B: and uh the special effects are good and is what people want too but i mean somebody wanted to see it so i i just go along but if it's my choice i would see a movie like rain man 

383.26 384.15 A: uh-huh 

387.02 388.03 A: right 

390.77 391.53 A: (( yeah )) 

391.26 402.15 B: like uh like the chosen one like uh if you like science fiction i mean uh what does your plenty of good movie but i don't have you know the title in my head right now um 

395.89 396.93 A: (( yeah )) 

400.52 405.22 A: right you know the last one i seen was that um triple x. 

405.20 406.41 B: triple x 

406.01 409.35 A: yeah that has some okay special effects 

406.74 407.48 B: yeah 

409.37 410.16 B: yeah 

409.46 411.67 A: of course the violence was there too 

411.58 412.77 B: yeah 

412.27 414.13 A: that's my husband's type of movie 

413.86 417.93 B: y- yeah uh trip- i mean yeah i think i saw triple x. too 

414.67 415.28 A: (( [laughter] ))

418.02 420.02 B: uh yeah 

420.46 424.83 B: yeah i think i i again it's too violent is and you know 

423.39 424.90 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

424.93 427.52 B: but you know if you go for i mean 

424.97 425.68 A: yeah 

427.77 435.97 B: if you study like i did uh three d. animation then you see the movie as an as an exercise that's completely different you know 

435.58 436.41 A: uh-huh 

435.86 446.09 B: (( but if i take the movie as a you know as a story no i will not remember triple x. you know about uh three weeks it disappear like james bond okay )) 

445.86 446.58 A: (( mhm ))

454.22 454.97 A: (( yeah )) 

454.46 455.35 B: so 

455.48 456.69 B: (( [lipsmack] i don't know what )) 

455.74 457.08 A: and blood and guts 

457.45 458.61 B: what 

458.02 459.79 A: and just blood and guts 

459.45 461.17 B: yes yes yes 

460.38 461.74 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

461.33 467.81 B: video game same thing you have a great video game like a chess game but how many gr- great video game 

465.32 466.17 A: (( yep )) 

468.26 473.53 B: are there not a lot uh most of them it's uh shooting and i mean why 

473.36 474.31 A: right 

473.62 477.34 B: you know it's it's sad it's a little sad you know i mean 

476.56 481.65 A: i think it t- takes a lot of hum- humanity out of life 

481.48 482.85 B: mhm 

482.21 484.90 A: you just point a gun at somebody and shoot 'em 

485.16 494.93 B: uh yes and not only that i think we are not individual in the soci- society in general or we are following whatever the trend is 

485.24 486.10 A: (( you know )) 

494.91 503.76 B: and if it's video game everybody play video game without uh really you know thinking about what is what is a good video game we just follow like you know 

503.86 508.62 B: like sheep and yeah we never it's difficult today 

503.87 505.44 A: exactly 

508.78 515.26 B: uh for people to challenge themselves and i don't know why you know uh for example in in swing dan- 

510.79 511.65 A: mhm 

512.76 515.99 A: you know i i think the same thing 

515.74 529.90 B: yeah in swing dancing i teach swing people sometime expect a simple move and i don't do that because then you don't need to pay me for that you know we challenge you with with to move as you never saw before you know i will make uh 

520.99 521.87 A: uh-huh 

524.35 525.46 A: right 

528.81 529.92 A: mhm 

529.95 535.34 B: make your dancing a little more difficult because if you achieve that you will be a a good uh swing dancer 

534.96 535.74 A: (( yeah )) 

535.41 544.65 B: so same thing in uh you know if i if i did uh if i do create a movie and i have a money for it i will first write it well 

544.26 545.23 A: (( yeah )) 

544.65 552.38 B: and think about the good story line you know before uh before everything else but sometime people don't want that they just want the you know 

552.87 561.02 B: the want action and is what they pay for it uh i don't get it but [laughter] and you obviously you agree with me but uh 

556.10 557.01 A: right 

557.15 557.94 A: yeah 

560.37 567.65 A: yes i i believe that so many people pigeonhole themselves right into what 

568.61 571.66 A: like producers think america wants 

571.23 572.50 B: yeah 

571.91 576.95 A: you know with all the blood and guts and i like a good old romantic love story 

576.68 577.60 B: (( yeah if )) 

577.34 578.39 A: (( you know )) 

577.62 588.09 B: it's well done again you know you have good yeah yeah because you have bad s- bad romantic story also you know i mean but a good a good movie is a good movie and you know when it's good 

579.10 581.53 A: exactly well done well 

582.92 584.58 A: yes definitely 

587.50 588.33 A: yep
