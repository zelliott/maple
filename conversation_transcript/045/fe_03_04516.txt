68.72 75.97 A: [lipsmack] not so good i'll put it that way ah there's a lot of public schools down h- i mean private schools 

71.67 73.02 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

76.33 80.38 A: and that's where if you've got the money you send them to private schools [noise] 

79.78 92.09 B: right yeah d- i don't know [mn] at least ah in the north east i think private schools are overrated because i know friends that went to private schools or or even ah you know you know 

93.07 97.13 B: (( i don't know it d- it tends to mess them up [laughter] )) 

95.75 96.87 A: mhm 

97.53 98.24 B: (( you )) 

98.67 108.03 B: know i mean i know i mean a lot of friends went to catholic school whatever and it's like it i mean those are people that ah you know rebel against their parents and you 

108.31 110.60 B: (( know always seem to ah you )) 

111.39 112.28 B: (( know )) 

113.15 117.36 B: hated private school and just you know act out because of it 

117.66 118.57 A: (( mhm okay )) 

118.79 121.75 A: (( well the public schools like i said are )) 

121.78 126.69 A: in fact i ah two or three bondings strictly because they are 

126.88 137.86 A: coming to pieces to a certain extent holes in the walls holes in the ceilings ah this type deal yet if you really look at the dollar sign they get millions of dollars a year 

129.35 130.26 B: right 

137.86 142.63 A: i mean they get a tremendous amount of money that they could utilize 

138.29 139.09 B: (( okay )) 

142.75 151.87 A: ah i come from mississippi both my parents were schoolteachers small town mississippi and i mean even that ah they ah 

147.84 148.83 B: mhm 

152.21 160.18 A: [sigh] and i went through segregation or desegregation back in seventy two so i'm pretty old one and i saw where the ah 

160.26 162.37 A: quality of ah 

162.64 166.80 A: the schools or the quality of education just dropped 

166.24 167.76 B: mhm 

167.10 171.88 A: back um from where it was then to where it is now i mean 

171.81 176.54 B: w- and wha- and what do you think they have to do to bring it back to the level that it was at 

172.08 172.77 A: they 

177.02 180.67 A: (( ah [sigh] )) 

182.64 191.60 A: they'd have to quit bussing to a certain extent and just have a regular well they in the end you'd have your bad sections and your good sections bad schools and good schools so 

189.57 190.55 B: right 

191.90 197.80 A: i don't know bussing isn't in the solution they've been trying that for years and it just doesn't work 

197.11 198.22 B: right 

197.82 199.12 A: um 

199.99 204.68 A: and money they can drop a lot of money in the school and improve it to ah 

205.10 207.22 A: a lot of it is if they would 

207.57 215.12 A: teach the kids down here ah the laws are so bad that ah well i'm not saying the laws are so bad 

215.15 222.99 A: you can actually graduate without even learning anything you can't fail them two years in a row say you know 

219.26 220.18 B: (( mm )) 

223.02 223.97 B: right 

223.20 229.27 A: and then there are all the lawsuits where people who graduate high school and then sue because they can't read or write 

229.35 230.23 B: (( [laughter] )) 

229.87 238.35 A: [laughter] so that's how poor they they have to change the laws they going to have actually become teachers and train 

235.09 236.08 B: right 

238.36 243.62 A: and discipline is a problem as well strictly because you can't whip anymore you can't 

243.63 246.45 A: so they going to have to come up with a new line of discipline 

246.82 247.99 B: right 

248.43 255.67 B: you know i mean in my neck of the woods i guess the main problem is oh overcrowding i mean there's always i mean ah you know 

255.94 258.56 B: (( fifty students per class and you )) 

258.72 259.79 B: know 

260.68 262.19 B: (( and um you )) 

263.37 268.46 B: know you get used to learning in that type of en- environment but um 

268.50 272.36 B: (( you know obviously there there are smaller classes of even )) 

272.39 277.85 B: students that weren't doing so well would get more attention and probably wouldn't fall through the cracks as much 

277.61 279.53 A: mhm 

279.59 286.60 A: and that's ah down here it's not overcrowded ah i guess the public schools would be yes ah 

285.81 286.90 B: mhm 

286.88 288.80 A: (( and [mn] )) 

290.16 292.07 A: they have built a few 

292.33 300.09 A: two schools in the last five years i guess because the old ones are but they just shut the old ones down so they didn't improve the 

295.46 296.43 B: mhm 

300.35 304.90 A: um amount of teaching capacity or amount of schooling capacity 

304.89 305.79 B: right 

305.08 313.11 A: but to improve it ah they'd have to take a new look at it and actually concentrate on teaching 

313.21 316.41 A: rather than changing the whole system up 

313.62 320.47 B: (( right that was another thing i was going to ask you the um how do you think the teachers are ah down there )) 

320.75 322.20 B: (( i mean ah )) 

322.89 326.44 A: it's only well you've got your hands tied you can't discipline 

326.21 327.46 B: right 

326.87 341.31 A: um not like the old days i'll put it that way tried and then you know there's no discipline whatsoever and if there's no discipline then the kids takeover to a certain extent and um 

330.09 331.11 B: right 

337.27 338.21 B: right 

345.01 347.44 A: [sigh] i don't know um 

348.83 361.89 A: you'll back to the old days and you'd have to actually change the laws to the extent you could fail a certain number of people and if they didn't learn then they didn't pass and until they start that up again 

356.53 357.44 B: right 

361.70 364.43 A: because right now it's just a free ride 

362.15 363.15 B: (( yeah )) 

363.81 377.60 B: right yeah i'm surprised that it's like that because i mean in ah i mean in new york city i mean new york city's like california i mean they're they're the laws are pretty strict on things and they're pretty pr- proactive and and we 

373.97 375.03 A: mhm 

378.37 387.58 B: have ah have ah regions testing and really standardized tests where if you don't pass them you don't graduate you don't you know pass the class 

387.01 387.94 A: okay 

389.23 390.56 B: (( and ah )) 

390.67 398.81 B: (( you know as i said i mean there i know california does a lot of that and i know new york does a lot of that and i i don't think too many other states do )) 

398.61 399.77 A: no they don't 

399.82 407.32 A: especially not in the south ah it's gotten now but then again the federal law has gotten taken effect to a certain extent 

406.95 407.80 B: right 

407.60 410.30 A: ah and then double a._c._p. 

410.28 422.83 A: ah my mother was a schoolteacher and like i said this was years past but they came up and then double a._c._p. would call her in three times to the office had meetings to where if somebody said i'm going to floor you 

423.05 424.09 B: mhm 

423.09 425.01 A: then that's proper english 

425.20 439.64 A: and to a s- [laughter] and that was the actual truth ah you couldn't they didn't want you to count off misspelling okay oh yes and this was back in like i said it's been a while but that's how and it's 

433.75 434.93 B: (( [laughter] wow )) 

439.78 444.10 A: to a certain extent the same as now ah they um 

445.31 456.04 A: [sigh] push it to the extent that teachers really can't teach of course she baulked at it and ah refused to go that route and of course the school system sort of backed her up at that stage 

455.95 457.01 B: mhm 

456.39 467.02 A: but that's the type of scenario we have here um and what it has gotten down to was you can actually go through the school system without learning how to read 

466.66 467.59 B: right 

467.33 473.18 A: and so ah i totally agree with new york and california in that respect 

474.03 475.57 A: and um 

475.68 483.58 A: it will be nice if they ever go back to it here which they probably haven't ah bussing is 

480.17 480.87 B: (( yeah )) 

481.84 482.90 B: well 

483.67 488.63 A: you know they've spent millions and millions on dollars particularly on loggers down here 

488.61 489.95 B: right 

489.67 494.52 A: per year and it's just gotten ridiculous right there 

494.53 504.82 A: and if they dropped the money back into the schools then i'm sure those corruption and grass because they catch them constantly down here somebody funding the money off ah 

501.70 502.73 B: right 

503.98 505.35 B: right 

505.58 508.67 A: along those lines would work 

509.75 511.37 A: and so um 

513.20 515.05 B: (( yeah i mean that it's )) 

515.11 518.32 B: i guess it's rough what when ah you know 

518.21 532.17 B: when the local law i mean if there are no federal laws then you know everybody goes by city and local laws and and i mean every place is different i mean without some sort of standard i mean you're going to have 

532.42 535.43 B: well you know such big differences between places you 

535.23 537.11 A: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

537.25 544.32 B: know something like ah an education there probably should be more federal laws and everybody would be on the same 

544.58 555.63 B: (( grounds but i guess you know i guess there would then there would be complaints that you know n- you know nobody in a certain areas are are passing and then what do you do with all those people i )) 

555.00 556.73 A: mhm 

556.06 557.50 B: (( don't know i mean n- you )) 

557.84 568.10 B: know p- people want it ah both ways i mean as i said if you made it harder to pass school people would be suing that you know well you know nobody's passing it's too hard 

568.65 576.75 A: right and then here comes the discrimination again the laws are discriminating against ah the coloreds or whatever i guess 

572.10 573.12 B: right 

576.94 577.71 A: (( or )) 

577.93 579.13 A: spanish 

579.28 580.40 B: right 

579.88 588.50 A: but ah the schools aren't ah if they would just get back to basic ah if you and of course that goes to 

588.44 595.38 A: the kids are learning quicker nowadays and they are forced into more ah learning of what they're doing in the 

595.80 599.95 A: ah fourth and fifth grade we used to do in the seventh and eighth grade so that
