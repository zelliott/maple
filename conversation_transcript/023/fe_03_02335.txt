10.42 11.41 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

11.84 12.46 B: (( mm )) 

13.47 14.36 B: (( er )) 

22.80 26.83 B: you know i haven't ever really paid that much attention to it but 

26.85 30.27 B: i guess i would i would have to agree since 

30.32 37.62 B: well as i've gotten older sometimes it looks like the colds are more you know tenacious it's harder to get rid of 'em 

37.41 39.09 A: yes that's for s- 

37.94 39.48 B: yeah they last mhm 

39.26 42.47 A: that's for sure well i get a c- flu shot every year so 

42.30 54.73 A: 'cause i have several different illnesses and so i get a flu shot every year and it sure does make a big difference i used to always say [sigh] i would never get a flu shot 'cause they were silly but after i got one the first year and 

52.36 53.27 B: (( mhm [noise] mhm )) 

54.54 59.04 A: didn't get sick that year and it sure did make a big difference with me 'cause i 

58.94 72.23 A: i don't like to get sick i get i have a raspy throat as it is and when i get sick it always goes right to my throat and then i lose my voice and it's just not a fun experience so i definitely like my flu shots so 

69.90 70.83 B: mhm 

72.53 75.50 A: do you have any other illnesses that you take care of 

75.75 82.80 B: mhm well yeah i have i do have some things that i got need to be dealing with that i haven't really uh 

83.09 84.40 B: you know uh 

84.65 87.49 B: worked on like i should you know but mm 

86.27 92.51 A: yeah when you get a little bit older sometimes yo- they seem to pop up when you don't expect them for sure 

92.73 94.36 A: (( so i don't know )) 

93.31 96.32 B: well one thing i was thinking about about a cold was 

96.65 104.10 B: i remember when i was um right now i'm sixty years old and i remember when i was around twenty maybe 

100.71 101.59 A: mhm 

104.42 106.07 B: one or something like that 

106.18 108.86 B: there was a lady at work that had a cold 

109.19 110.38 B: and 

110.75 114.04 B: she was just coughing and everything and then i noticed that her 

114.10 115.59 B: nose was peeling 

115.82 117.02 A: (( oh goodness )) 

115.82 121.51 B: and and you know i i really didn't think a lot about it at the time i i mean 

121.79 126.64 B: but i noticed it i think that was the first time i'd seen somebody's nose like peeling 

126.36 127.34 A: uh-huh 

126.71 131.34 B: and then after i got older then my nose started doing that like you know you blow it so much 

130.16 132.67 A: (( [laughter] yeah i'll say )) 

131.48 136.09 B: and then the skin dries out and starts yeah flaking off 

133.81 135.98 A: dries out right 

136.11 138.61 B: and then it gets kind of tender you know 

138.28 140.01 A: right right 

138.80 140.79 B: so i mean i hate having a cold 

140.64 142.29 A: yeah that's for sure 

141.14 143.27 B: but i've never had a flu shot though mhm 

143.01 147.70 A: well yeah like i say i i did- didn't have until up ab- about three years ago and 

147.59 161.63 A: i started having some heart problems and so when you do that well then they start giving you ever everything they can possibly imagine and a flu shot is one of the things they usually give you and so i got a flu shot and like i say it really did make a big difference and [mn] and it really 

161.46 172.98 A: like i say i live up here in oregon and it's we have so many allergy type things up here so many different kinds of of plants and stuff that is in the air that causes people to have allergies so 

172.93 186.71 A: if you have any kind of allergies at all and you're here you're definitely going to get a cold or a runny nose and i find that that even even helps with that is i haven't had near the allergy type problems that i've had in the past before i got my flu shot so 

186.12 188.07 B: [noise] i'm i've never been to oregon 

187.82 189.57 A: (( oh )) 

188.59 190.07 B: i'm from chicago
