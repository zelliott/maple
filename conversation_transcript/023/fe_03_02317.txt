1.89 3.41 B: (( hi i'm john )) 

4.00 7.52 A: what did they say i couldn't hear what they said they're saying 

7.33 20.22 B: the topic is about when seasons change um do you feel like you have did they change how you feel like colds or things like that 

10.35 11.27 A: mhm 

17.40 18.03 A: (( like )) 

19.19 21.33 A: yeah definitely does with me 

21.41 28.16 B: and they want and they want to know whether there's and all that if you could talk about it we could talk about it 

21.43 22.48 A: (( um [noise] )) 

26.62 27.39 A: okay 

28.48 29.67 B: (( how about for you )) 

28.56 29.52 A: um 

29.75 40.56 A: every fall and every spring i get migraines and um then when we have major storms i get a migraine and a lot of it's from the allergies 

40.85 49.25 A: and so i have to take um an antihistamine and um you know pain medication for my head but i have to take an antihistamine all the time 

49.55 56.19 A: um and especially when the pollen gets really really bad when you can see it on you know the cars et cetera 

56.33 57.49 A: what about you 

58.04 62.15 B: i have epilepsy so actually and um 

62.24 64.23 B: i get some mild depression 

64.36 68.36 B: when when you're right like when the fall or spring changes 

68.62 76.17 B: actually i've been doing a study on it it uh the barometric pressure changes quite a bit in the fall and the spring 

76.14 83.90 B: and i'm a former brain surgery patient so i have a uh a cavity actually up in 

76.16 76.85 A: (( right )) 

80.13 81.13 A: mhm 

83.94 85.56 B: my brain where 

85.96 89.72 B: where there's nothing in there it's fluid it's not solid mass 

89.52 90.73 A: mhm 

90.28 103.38 B: so you know like when you go on the airplane and you are going to land and your ears feel like they're going to blow up your whole face feels bad and you choose either yawn or you chew gum or you 

94.84 95.79 A: right 

97.49 98.47 A: right 

103.52 108.36 B: pinch your nose and and blow out and all that anything to make that pain go away 

108.05 109.18 A: right 

109.12 113.54 B: same concept except for in my head it can't go anywhere so 

113.57 119.89 B: it creates this horrible uh either migraine as well or i have seizures 

120.21 121.19 A: mm 

120.36 125.83 B: and uh there really isn't any medicine i can take for it and it's 

125.84 133.81 B: it's just a awful time period but it happens every it happens every fall and spring and i used to live in south carolina where 

133.89 139.38 B: you know you can get falls or spring a couple of times during the year because the weather's so weird 

138.82 140.15 A: right 

139.51 144.67 B: but now i live up north and so it's pretty consistent 

140.70 141.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

144.64 159.63 B: until when the fall and the spring come around i just kind of brace myself for it so it's not it's not a common cold type thing but it's definitely you know if i hadn't had the surgery and all that happened i don't think i would have a problem with it i i didn't before 

149.88 151.00 A: right 

159.45 163.76 B: and um it's pretty much that i do i also have 

163.77 171.20 B: migraines though and when it rains the same thing when it when it rains or suppose we go from one day where it's 

171.48 179.23 B: hot and and dry and everything then it goes cold and rainy or back and forth it's really bad 

171.79 172.62 A: [noise] 

177.25 178.39 A: right 

179.62 180.83 A: well that 

179.77 184.51 B: but it's not excuse me from blithering or anything 

183.76 187.40 A: no but it affects me that way also um 

187.44 197.84 A: in fact i have to take [noise] you know pain medicine and lay down [noise] and you know do all that and uh decongestant but when the barometric pressure changes like you say 

197.77 206.25 A: i get i get a migraine also [mn] but i started taking botox injections and that seemed to help some 

197.81 199.54 B: (( all right )) 

206.35 207.63 B: botox 

207.32 208.66 A: mhm 

208.30 209.58 B: (( what is that oh )) 

209.73 210.68 A: it's 

210.70 211.78 A: it's uh 

212.18 219.23 A: it's used a lot in plastic surgery but um it's also used it kills the nerve cells 

219.70 221.12 A: and 

219.81 220.95 B: (( i see )) 

221.89 223.08 A: um 

223.14 229.78 A: so it helps with some types of migraines and it seemed to help a little bit with mine but 

230.14 231.22 A: um 

232.04 238.27 A: you know with the change of seasons it it just it just kills me i've been pretty bad lately 

238.52 239.80 A: um 

240.28 242.19 B: well where i mean where are you 

242.21 243.97 A: i live in missouri 

244.20 245.12 B: oh 

245.86 249.55 A: so we get back and forth back and forth 

250.12 251.35 B: i see 

250.25 251.27 A: it's [noise] 

251.37 253.44 A: it's really different oh you know 

253.65 258.24 A: like we've been having i can tell when we're going to have horrific storms 

258.37 262.55 A: like yesterday we had you know two bouts of major storms 

262.48 265.71 B: right you can tell beforehand right 

264.81 279.28 A: right but also it affects my allergies the spring and and and th- mainly the spring affects my allergies and so um in fact i may have to have sinus surgery because i have such a bad ear infection this year 

279.33 281.03 A: and sinus infection 

280.99 287.00 B: have you been have you been to see someone who does allergy tests to see what all you're allergic to yet 

281.13 281.99 A: and 

286.40 288.39 A: yeah i have 

287.80 288.71 B: (( oh )) 

289.19 293.35 A: um but i don't want to do the shots [laughter] 

292.91 298.74 B: oh yeah i did that you know but that was for foods but they're not bad the shots don't hurt you 

296.81 297.54 A: uh-huh 

298.84 302.31 B: you think they would they don't hurt at all you can't even tell 

301.75 302.86 A: really 

302.59 307.19 B: yeah that's seriously it they are so those needles are so small you 

307.26 309.70 B: can't tell or you do them yourself 

309.22 310.35 A: mhm 

310.12 311.32 B: piece of cake 

310.38 316.87 A: well i may go i may go ahead and and do that then 'cause it would make life a little bit easier 

316.90 321.11 A: but um i'm supposed to be allergic to dogs and cats 

321.17 327.05 A: but i really don't have any problem i have several i have like six cats and a dog 

327.20 335.27 A: and i really don't have seem to have any problems with them but you know it it's just the weather change and the um the pollen 

335.27 344.22 A: you know when the pollen is since you since you you used to live in south carolina remember how the pollen used to the pine pollen used to just have yellow all over your car 

339.45 341.48 B: yeah 

343.54 357.41 B: (( yeah i- it killed a lot of p i mean i- a- a lot of people have problems down there i don't i have a real quick question to ask you i don't know if this is legit or not but this is the first time i've done one of these calls um you been doing these )) 

348.30 349.49 A: right 

355.72 356.81 A: me too 

357.11 359.18 A: no this is the first time i've done one 

358.93 364.94 B: oh oh i'm wondering whether they tax implications is i mean is this considered income or what 

364.09 369.50 A: i don't know but i think we're supposed to talk about the subject [laughter] i don't think we're supposed to get off the subject 

367.26 373.72 B: yeah well i- i- i can talk to someone else about that but yeah as far as the rest of the subject then 

371.08 371.98 A: but 

374.65 376.01 B: (( you know it )) 

374.72 380.32 A: well now that you live up up up north um allergies are not as bad up north you don't think 

379.33 390.23 B: well i- i never had allergies up north it definitely give i live in new york city and uh so it's it's pretty stable i mean you have a you have a summer you have a fall and you have a- 

384.11 385.22 A: mhm 

390.28 391.88 B: (( a spring and a winter )) 

392.11 395.80 B: and like i said it's the transition usually the transition 

396.02 398.70 B: is harder going from 

398.63 411.14 B: spring to summer with the weather change there because you have about a week two week area unless it's a weird what year like this year where you have very dramatic changes in the weather 

411.02 412.10 A: mhm 

411.16 420.68 B: and that's when i get sick or whether it's uh and and then the same thing with the fall fall to winter but once the winter comes mm 

418.20 419.79 A: well that's what killed me 

420.64 424.13 A: that's what killed me this this spring is because it would be like 

424.21 438.30 A: in the thirties and then all of a sudden the next day you know you'd get a seventy and then the barometric pressure would change and it would start raining and then you'd go back to thirty and [laughter] it just jumped around so much 

439.15 447.61 B: we- uh uh i'm so curious about that medicine that you're on though i- i- do you take that and it just relaxes the nerve or do you have to actually inject it or 

446.61 449.71 A: it's in- it's injections that the doctor does 

449.85 450.84 A: (( a lot of my )) 

449.93 451.89 B: but it's in your head 

451.32 452.59 A: oh uh-huh 

453.07 458.14 B: i'm going to have to find out about that because it i mean i i'm in i get in excruciating pain 

453.18 454.49 A: (( in the temple )) 

458.34 459.56 B: from mine 

458.85 465.13 A: y- your temples and the tops top of your head all around your hairline and the back of your neck 

461.96 463.12 B: yeah 

464.97 471.19 B: right and i also used to drink a lot of water and that would help but that doesn't do it you know 

469.88 472.16 A: no caffeine helps 

472.07 475.77 B: i can't do that i'm like with the epilepsy i can't have caffeine 

475.52 476.53 A: right 

476.20 480.98 B: so i mean but uh i'm definitely glad you told me about that 'cause 

477.79 478.53 A: (( we )) 

481.23 485.19 B: i- i- you know i'm not it's a rough it's a rough couple of weeks 

485.74 487.61 B: you know each seasons 

485.81 490.95 A: right well i'd talk to a migraine specialist 

491.69 494.89 B: a a neurologist or just a migraine specialist 

494.29 497.48 A: a migraine specialist they a lot some 

497.59 501.12 A: some doctors are migraine specialists and that's what i would do 

499.81 500.85 B: i see 

501.71 502.80 A: um 

503.11 506.01 A: that you know that's what i would do i go to one and that's 

506.13 514.02 A: where i get them they're really expensive but my insurance pays for it but what what it is normally is 

510.22 511.92 B: right 

514.70 517.00 A: it's used in plastic surgery 

517.89 518.94 B: i see 

518.05 521.46 A: and to help women with their 

521.49 522.81 A: the wrinkles 

523.16 527.53 A: because it kills the nerve endings so it relaxes the face muscles so 

523.29 524.21 B: uh-huh 

528.42 530.49 A: and the wrinkles aren't there 

530.61 536.94 A: but it really helps with they've done a lot of studies and it shows that it really does help with migraines 

538.49 540.13 B: i hope you get better 

538.54 539.50 A: so if you 

540.18 550.21 A: well i will i'll be fine in a couple of weeks once the weather quits changing and you know all that but and the pollen's gone 

549.03 549.91 B: i'm uh 

550.34 551.86 B: (( i'm sorry what )) 

551.65 553.89 A: and once all the pollen has gone 

554.09 555.31 B: right 

554.68 556.84 A: 'cause right now i'm taking allegra 

557.15 560.64 A: but i've had to be on antibiotics for four weeks 'cause i- it 

560.96 564.44 A: i get so congested it gets into my ears and then 

564.80 569.39 A: you know and i get a sinu- sinus infection and an ear infection and so 

569.64 571.87 B: and so you got it pretty bad though 

571.85 573.23 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

573.29 577.08 A: yeah but then the rest of the time i'm you know usually pretty okay 

577.73 583.44 B: how about just regular colds and stuff like i- i don't get well i probably just get you know 

583.68 590.22 B: temperature colds and things like that i- i don't i never get just regular colds when the weather 

588.42 589.56 A: no 

589.68 591.07 A: i don't either 

591.74 595.90 A: you know i don't seem to either i seem to be you know fine 

596.12 598.15 A: other than that so 

599.25 599.89 A: (( i don't know ))
