9.53 13.29 A: hi liselle did you get the topic of the day 

12.94 13.97 B: illness 

13.48 18.31 A: yeah something about a cold lasting seven days if you don't go to the doctors 

18.40 20.07 A: and five days if you do 

20.93 25.58 A: which i find to be hmm that might be a little bit true 

27.22 30.96 A: and something about the weather changing too right 

30.09 31.25 B: mhm 

32.06 34.32 A: do you get sick when the weather change mhm in the 

34.29 39.99 B: the only time i get sick when the weather changes is if i go outside and my hair's soaking wet and it's snowing outside 

40.53 43.54 B: but uh a common body reaction though 

44.04 45.56 A: (( cold mhm me too )) 

46.13 51.03 A: and i usually go to the doctors get some penicillin rest for a day and i'm fine 

52.16 60.64 A: but other than that i have a couple aches and pains and like my bones ache if it's gonna rain or something like that 

61.61 67.30 A: i guess you could say i'm old [laughter] but you know i'm not old [laughter] 

63.43 64.79 B: [laughter] 

66.56 67.51 B: [laughter] 

68.14 69.23 B: (( you sound )) 

68.21 69.91 A: or getting old 

69.33 70.76 B: pretty young huh 

73.36 76.40 A: mhm that's a kinda hard topic don't you think 

76.32 80.52 B: it is is a kind of a hard topic i mean i'm in the medical field but 

80.94 84.44 B: they they say starve a fever feed a cold 

83.26 85.77 A: mhm [laughter] 

84.95 94.22 B: you really can't starve somebody and expect something you know expect to get better but [laughter] it's one of those your body re- has to really fight 

88.50 90.43 A: to get well yeah 

94.37 98.00 B: off you know the illness 'cause everybody has a dormant in their system 

97.65 98.78 A: mhm 

98.19 106.70 B: so your body's overdoing itself and if your body overdoes itself and you don't have the vitamins there to fight it off you're not going to get better 

105.82 107.11 A: (( exactly like )) 

108.57 110.69 A: you're speaking the truth my sister 

111.22 112.49 B: [laughter] 

113.91 123.52 A: but um i don't get sick that much i used to have allergies they went away for some reason the older i get the better my allergies get so i don't even have to deal with that any more 

124.17 129.37 A: maybe a cold every now every three years or something but other than that 

129.63 133.91 A: i feel fine thank the lord [laughter] 

131.84 132.69 B: [laughter] 

133.50 136.09 B: what part of the united states do you live in 

136.14 138.29 A: uh east coast new jersey mhm 

137.93 139.09 B: new jersey 

139.29 144.19 B: well we i live in ohio but when we lived in california none of my kids got sick 

143.72 145.24 A: oh yeah mhm 

144.77 145.61 B: (( 'cause it )) 

145.82 151.27 B: the moist humid not moist it's the dry humidity and out here it's the moist humidity 

150.75 152.06 A: right 

152.75 158.60 A: right i think maybe germs can live better in the moist humidity than in the dry 

152.83 154.02 B: a lot more 

156.14 157.59 B: than in the dry 

158.87 163.88 B: well well if you think about it mould will form quicker in moist than it will in dry 

163.39 164.44 A: true 

165.64 166.52 A: (( yes )) 

165.73 170.32 B: so that's why the majority of the east coast get sick at winter time 

169.43 170.58 A: mhm mhm 

173.05 175.94 A: so were your kids born in in california mhm 

175.26 181.81 B: born yeah in i can't say born and raised but [laughter] 'cause they're only still little but 

181.89 184.59 B: yes they were all three born back there and 

183.69 186.43 A: oh okay so maybe they're also immune to 

186.69 190.11 A: the dry air too since they were born there 

189.72 197.07 B: and when we brought them out here all three of them ended up with an ear infection instantly and it was like oh i'm moving back [laughter] 

193.11 194.55 A: oh gosh 

196.21 198.09 A: [laughter] 

197.39 200.00 B: that's why the elderly move that way 

199.73 202.63 A: uh-huh and to florida and stuff like that 

202.07 205.53 B: yes because it slows the dying process down 

205.08 208.30 A: oh did not know that 

207.72 218.82 B: [laughter] it's like you have you know you know that whole you gotta go go to the doctor if it lasts more than seven days well you can only pump someone full of medication so much 

218.32 219.42 A: (( mhm right )) 

218.82 226.20 B: and they're gonna become immune to it and you put them in a dry climate and their body's not fighting to keep everything going 

220.49 221.58 A: mhm 

225.83 231.74 A: right right yeah it's gotta also keep itself warm and uh fight off the sickness 

232.31 234.75 A: mm that's very interesting 

235.34 239.07 B: kind of a hard subject to start off with but [laughter] 

237.46 241.22 A: yeah yeah yeah we worked it out [laughter] 

245.17 250.32 A: so that's why old people move down south they like migrate like birds 

249.74 252.38 B: oh trust me they do [laughter] 

251.26 253.42 A: [laughter] 

252.86 260.55 B: i mean i have nothing against the elderly but we live in a population this little city that we lived in it only had four thousand people 

260.83 264.19 B: i say only three hundred of them in california 

261.44 263.27 A: mm in california 

263.56 264.69 A: mhm 

264.28 268.78 B: and only three hundred of those people in this town were under the age of forty 

268.48 269.10 A: (( dag )) 

269.57 273.23 B: so driving down the road kinda got irritating after a while [laughter] 

272.12 275.96 A: [laughter] i bet it did 

274.22 277.45 B: good that your kids were always okay outside playing 

276.99 280.04 A: yeah they can push a car 

279.58 280.82 B: [laughter] 

281.05 283.03 A: slow as the cars are going mm 

286.55 288.75 A: i have to look into that because um 

289.03 298.74 A: if that's really true then my grandmother maybe she'll do a lot better uh in florida or califor- well in florida we don't know anybody in california we 

299.02 303.79 B: my grandma just moved back up from florida they lived there for the longest time 

303.91 314.19 B: and she broke her hip so that whole traditional move back around the family kind of thing they came back up here and she has been nothing but sick for the last six months 

306.14 307.39 A: (( have mhm oh )) 

310.00 311.08 A: yeah 

313.77 314.98 A: oh man 

315.39 317.82 B: she's just not really gotten into the 

318.15 320.69 B: here's the climate change you know it's 

321.15 323.07 B: completely moist air 

323.78 328.06 B: that's why a lot of your elderly i don't know if you've stepped into a nursing home 

328.39 331.46 B: but that nursing home is hot as could be 

331.73 334.39 B: because they consistently have that heater running 

334.83 337.66 B: it could be ninety degrees outside but they're freezing 

337.35 340.42 A: mhm mhm mhm oh right yeah they are that's true 

342.07 343.22 A: that's true 

344.33 358.98 A: my grandmother lived in uh a complex where it's nothing but old people were allowed to move into the apartments and it's all she had the heat turned actually taken out had her radiators taken out of her apartment and her apartment's still hot because she's on the tenth floor 

359.26 363.89 A: but i see what you mean about they always keep the heat on that's true [cough] 

363.88 369.01 B: yeah it's like three hundred degrees but oh i'm still freezing honey 

367.95 369.90 A: mhm and with a sweater on 

369.48 373.19 B: (( [laughter] yeah always and )) 

371.37 376.69 A: that's why a lot of them in the summer time a lot of people you know old older people are more 

376.76 378.70 A: you know likely to um 

378.82 380.54 A: have fatalities 

380.93 386.30 A: because they don't realize how hot it really is they think they're cold 

385.65 387.36 B: they'll have a heat stroke 

386.92 389.86 A: mhm end up having a heat stroke 

393.63 397.00 B: do you agree with the saying that they have after a week 

398.15 399.76 A: after a week what 

399.28 400.78 B: go to the doctor 

401.60 407.38 A: i don't wait that long [laughter] say a cold's not going to be serious and 

403.19 404.52 B: [laughter] 

407.40 417.38 A: and after a day or if i feel my body aching and getting a headache and stuff you know that after a day or two i'm at the doctors i don't wait that long i'm sorry 

416.86 419.46 B: i don't think anybody really waits a week 

418.73 420.68 A: yeah a week um phew 

421.28 427.19 B: you go walking into the doc okay it's been seven days i'm on my deathbed help me [laughter] 

421.54 422.46 A: goodness 

423.96 425.21 A: (( mhm )) 

426.73 432.56 A: but now on the news and stuff they say it's uh people go to the doctors and you can get over counter over the counter medicine 

432.43 438.81 A: that could heal you just as good as the doctors and they say americans are wasting money going going to the doctors 

435.00 436.47 B: just as quick 

438.65 448.09 A: for stuff that can be cured but how are we supposed to know what to take unless we ask the doctor and to do that you have to go to the doctors 

445.08 446.42 B: very true 

447.58 451.20 B: because if you like the e._r. or something well i think you need to be seen 

450.86 453.27 A: and that calls for more than a doctors 

454.61 457.18 A: and more frustrating than going to the doctors 

457.68 458.63 B: well the 

458.77 466.90 B: i it's not really off the subject but those swing tests that they came out with you know i work with a lot of people who like oh but they got so many vitamins in it 

467.14 468.25 A: oh yeah 

467.61 470.60 B: we got into this conversation last night to where 

470.62 475.03 B: we wanted to take it because we heard that if you pour it into a regular soda can 

475.05 477.18 B: it would eat straight through it 

476.46 477.38 A: (( mhm oh )) 

477.33 481.07 B: and i'm thinking well gee why do you all this weight but 

480.41 482.27 A: oh my gosh 

481.47 486.01 B: we never did it last night because we got you know too wrapped up into what we were doing 

485.45 486.88 A: mhm 

486.42 489.39 B: but i have yet to do that that's one of those 

489.78 491.58 B: how could you consume it 

491.16 493.19 A: mhm mhm 

492.06 494.14 B: if it's gonna eat through a soda can 

493.48 498.26 A: yeah maybe that's why they put it in for for cans because 

498.64 503.23 A: it does eat through the tin or aluminum or whatever cans are made of 

503.57 508.46 B: in amer- well not america but on the news they were also saying that all these 

508.89 512.35 B: all these vitamins and stuff can actually be hurting you 

512.58 514.24 B: instead of helping you 

514.33 521.52 B: so go back to the natural eat your vegetables and but how can you do that when they're spreading all the chemicals on them 

517.10 518.20 A: (( mm right )) 

521.16 523.79 A: yeah you got that right so 

524.05 528.60 A: damned damned if you do and damned if you don't [laughter] 

524.07 525.12 B: [laughter]
