0.42 1.67 A: emily 

1.48 2.66 B: marla 

3.50 4.43 A: hello 

4.17 5.05 B: hello 

4.82 5.88 A: hi 

5.44 6.25 B: (( hi )) 

6.12 7.07 A: um 

7.46 9.41 A: ha- have you done this before 

8.90 10.46 B: no this is my first time 

9.87 19.86 A: this is my first time too [laughter] [laughter] um i so i guess do we just each take our turns in telling which one is the worst or okay 

10.98 13.75 B: okay good [laughter] [laughter] 

18.06 19.17 B: that's fine 

20.06 21.10 A: um 

21.71 23.34 A: (( do you want me to go first )) 

22.96 37.47 B: well i already know what i wanna say so that's up to you [laughter] [laughter] okay um well out of the list they gave us i personally think gossiping is the worst um because to me you hurt other people's feelings um and you're involving other people in that 

24.52 27.38 A: okay go ahead then you talk [cough] 

37.29 44.89 B: and most of the other things that i can remember that were listed to me are more of a personal thing as far as your health or um 

45.02 57.53 B: other than smoking which i know second hand you can get hurt from that but to me it's more of a personal based type of reason why you would be hurting yourself um also i'm a christian so i know gossiping is considered 

57.49 70.60 B: wrong in the bible for reasons of you know you just you don't talk about other people you don't be judgemental that type of thing it's not our place in life to do that um i'm really not sure what else to say [laughter] 

69.91 70.81 A: um 

71.38 76.68 A: [cough] well i guess based on my personal experiences um i'm a registered nurse so 

76.97 86.25 A: obviously all these are [laughter] bad for your health and i don't think that they're i've seen the the effects of every one of these um in the hospital 

80.02 80.77 B: (( mm right )) 

83.89 84.84 B: mhm 

86.27 90.07 A: and gossiping like you said also um 

90.35 94.01 A: it isn't right to do although a lot of people do do it and um 

94.14 97.93 A: it can hurt feelings and it can also put a lot of stress on you 

97.69 98.89 B: mhm 

98.32 100.16 A: and uh emotionally 

100.49 107.82 A: so basically i c- i i can't pick just one that is worse that the other i think they're all pretty equally um 

107.86 111.28 A: bad for you and bad for you health actually so 

109.71 111.18 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

111.81 115.00 A: um i don't know what else to say about it [laughter] 

113.50 116.11 B: [laughter] and that's what i'm thinking 

115.75 117.36 A: [laughter] 

117.43 122.49 A: for ten minutes this is really hard [laughter] [laughter] on personal habits 

118.89 121.62 B: [laughter] yes [laughter] 

122.40 123.26 B: yeah 

122.85 124.41 A: uh do you smoke 

124.11 129.23 B: uh no i don't my husband does but i don't a- and actually i do have um 

125.04 127.42 A: no oh does he okay 

129.39 139.41 B: um some health issues based on his smoking now i have um a problem with my breathing based on the fact that they've told me because of his smoking 

133.08 134.26 A: (( second hand )) 

135.79 136.72 A: uh-huh 

138.96 140.06 A: right 

139.46 143.65 B: so i do know as i said that that is something that you can get second hand 

143.03 143.95 A: uh-huh 

144.15 152.21 B: so i mean from a personal standpoint i guess i could say even that that's really i mean i do know it's bad because like i said it's affected my life now 

149.81 151.13 A: yeah 

151.42 153.19 A: right right 

152.66 153.36 B: (( um )) 

153.59 154.61 A: um 

155.07 167.82 A: drinking alcohol as far as occasionally i i don't see any but at long term affects i can see a lot and especially you know working around people in the hospital that come in um that have a lot of problems and then so 

166.53 175.04 B: right and i agree with you i think occasional sm- uh drinking is not you know if you're not going to the extreme with it and you're not putting yourself or someone else in danger 

168.61 169.21 A: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

175.07 178.50 B: i don't there's anything wrong with having a drink on occasion either 

178.01 178.98 A: mhm 

179.49 185.67 A: caffeine that's a biggie [laughter] i think me too [laughter] i try not to 

181.57 187.04 B: yeah i drink a lot of that so [laughter] pass [laughter] yeah yeah i know 

186.14 193.40 A: i don't drink coffee or tea but but you know i try uh as far as soda i just don't like coffee or tea that's the only reason why i don't drink it but 

193.45 196.84 A: uh as far as soda i try to get the caffeine free 

196.27 197.64 B: (( yeah right )) 

196.85 203.67 A: and again for me it just makes my heart rate which is weird 'cause some people like it makes me more calm but for me it makes me more jittery 

203.32 204.39 B: yeah 

203.71 205.27 A: if i drink it so 

205.57 212.79 A: and over time that also has a bad affect on your body but i don't have any personal like that doesn't bother me if somebody else drinks lots of i mean 

212.52 213.45 B: yeah 

212.87 214.49 A: on a personal basis 

214.16 223.33 B: well the only thing that i've noticed with that is that my husband it seems like when he's smoking he drinks coffee quite often and i've i've been told that that kind of goes hand in hand or it can 

222.97 224.00 A: mhm 

223.36 234.98 B: 'cause my mother in law also used to smoke for years like thirty years and she quit about five years ago and she smoked or drank a lot of coffee at the same time and she still drinks coffee but not as often 

234.65 235.64 A: uh-huh 

235.13 248.45 B: and i do notice my husband when he's drinking coffee he tends to smoke more it seems like so i don't know if there's something with the nicotine and the caffeine that might kind of go hand in hand i don't know [laughter] but i have noticed that so 

244.43 246.69 A: yeah that could be yeah 

248.10 258.57 A: what about like on a per- like as far as what bothers you the most like out of out of all these if somebody else is do- well like not doing it or doing it what bothers you like which one 

258.65 259.90 A: would you say 

259.89 261.08 B: um 

262.03 264.42 B: i mean you mean caffeine and all that 

263.32 265.71 A: like yeah i mean like what really 

264.46 274.57 B: i'd probably say smoking honestly would be the next one just because i know that there is a lot of second hand smoking that does you know bother other people and like i said for per- 

266.17 267.25 A: yeah 

274.54 279.88 B: point for my own self i know that um i've been trying for years to get my husband to quit smoking 

275.77 277.58 A: right 

279.90 288.95 B: and we've had three children and when i was pregnant with our first children i s- first child i said you know you really need to quit and he kept saying he would but then he hasn't 

288.36 289.32 A: mhm 

288.86 299.32 B: you know and he has a stressful job so i know that he uses that i don't know i wouldn't say as an excuse maybe but it seems to be his reason for why he's not um 

294.85 295.73 A: uh-huh 

299.46 304.89 B: [noise] you know smoking or not quitting right now but um i do know that that you know 

301.34 302.32 A: uh-huh 

305.03 310.51 B: that to me is probably the one the w- the worst thing you know for health reasons would be smoking definitely 

308.49 309.92 A: yeah 

310.22 323.78 A: that that would be my i mean that would probably be the out of all these that's the one that bothers me the most too and then gossiping would be second 'cause the rest of 'em if somebody drinks a lot or drinks i mean that doesn't bother me i mean that's your own 

313.90 314.83 B: right 

317.51 318.54 B: yeah 

323.78 325.38 B: unless they're driving 

323.92 324.86 A: (( you know )) 

325.04 326.24 A: yeah 

325.45 329.90 B: drinking and driving then that bothers me 'cause you're putting other people's lives in danger yeah 

326.26 327.37 A: oh yeah 

328.19 330.89 A: at risk right right 

329.95 330.91 B: right 

330.93 334.27 A: so yeah that would be like my third too that's 

334.74 337.79 A: that's what i feel like 'cause all those really do affect you 

335.98 336.72 B: yeah 

337.43 338.68 B: yeah oh yeah 

338.06 344.66 A: so but if somebody uses a lot of caffeine or overeats or exercises that can't affect other people so 

344.12 345.03 B: right 

344.69 346.89 A: yeah i feel the same way 

345.35 358.42 B: affects their own life i mean and it would affect me if it was like my mother or somebody that was close to me if they overate yeah or something and it was putting their health at risk and and to the point where you know i thought it was gonna be harmful to them and i was close to them 

349.83 351.30 A: a personal 

358.04 359.01 A: uh-huh 

358.62 362.64 B: but just overall for other people in general yeah i agree with you 

362.25 363.24 A: okay 

364.17 368.27 A: um i wonder if do they just does it beep or cut you off once 

367.38 373.84 B: they they said there was supposed to be some kind of recording or something that come on and tell us when ten minutes is up so [laughter] 

371.90 373.21 A: (( okay [laughter] )) 

374.35 376.22 A: oh geez [laughter] 

375.49 379.23 B: (( [laughter] i know i was think- thinking okay [laughter] )) 

377.52 380.79 A: [laughter] where are you from 

380.55 382.19 B: um oxford ohio 

381.99 391.30 A: okay i'm in indiana indianapolis yeah that's not too far [laughter] a friend of mine she she's been doing it yeah 

383.65 385.12 B: oh okay 

386.06 387.50 B: how did you hear about this 

388.32 401.72 B: that my sister in law yeah my sister in law she's we were talking on the internet 'cause she lives in florida and she was telling me about it and so i emailed last night and got the whole information in and today [laughter] i was surprised i thought wow 

391.65 392.22 A: (( [cough] ))

400.38 413.20 A: at two o'clock promptly the phone rings [laughter] that's the same here i registered last night too so that's kinda funny that at right at two o'clock i just couldn't believe it i was like oh my gosh they're already calling [laughter]

403.08 405.59 B: yeah [laughter] 

407.04 408.11 B: yeah 

411.41 413.69 B: yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

414.24 415.20 A: so 

415.41 416.23 B: yeah 

415.49 417.99 A: well i don't know what else to talk about i don't 

417.91 425.65 B: yeah i don't either i can you remember anything else that was on the list other than what was it caffeine smoking go- gossiping and what was the other one 

425.51 428.38 A: uh overeating and not exercising 

427.08 427.72 B: (( mm )) 

427.85 429.14 B: (( not exercising yeah )) 

429.77 439.10 A: overeating only bothers me well i can say this i had a meeting the other day at work [laughter] and there were two ladies there and we had [cough] 

434.08 435.42 B: mhm 

439.34 450.32 A: a whole box of doughnuts it was like probably two dozen there was eight people there total and there was two dozen dough- doughnuts and only three of the women only three of the women ate 

450.53 457.44 A: and um the doughnuts and i tell you where there was only like three doughnuts left out of twenty four when we left it was a five hour meeting 

455.47 456.65 B: (( oh my god )) 

457.12 458.24 B: yeah 

457.64 470.34 A: and that kinda bothered me just because i was like they just kept eating and eating and eating i was [laughter] just like really pissed off [laughter] there was twenty four doughnuts in there and there was only three people eating them and they were almost gone [laughter] 

464.43 465.98 B: [laughter] 

468.87 471.40 B: yeah that's like almost eight doughnuts a person 

470.70 483.84 A: it almost made me sick like i was just sitting there like oh my gosh you know is it are they gonna stop [laughter] but none of us other people you know we never it wasn't like they offered which i didn't want any anyway but um 

472.23 473.41 B: yeah 

474.90 476.02 B: yeah 

476.92 477.95 B: gee 

482.29 483.48 B: right 

483.88 490.73 B: it's just the principle of the thing too i mean it's kinda like geez you're kind of making a pig of yourself so to speak [laughter] [laughter] 

485.43 488.27 A: yes [laughter] 

488.65 503.23 A: it kinda made me it really did it made me sick 'cause when you think about how many doughnuts were there i was just like oh man i i mean i know physically i'd be sick if i eat that many [laughter] so that kinda made me so i guess i ha- on a personal basis i dealt with that yesterday 

491.59 492.40 B: (( oh )) 

496.76 498.65 B: yeah definitely 

503.10 503.87 A: [laughter] 

503.22 504.12 B: yeah 

505.10 509.11 A: and the other other only thing that they have on here was exercising 

508.77 509.75 B: right 

510.06 511.72 A: and 

510.96 521.35 B: i don't exercise as much as i should but now that it's getting warmer out i have been doing more of that in fact i've been trying to lose weight 'cause i've gained more weight the past year than i've ever had in my life 

521.31 526.02 B: and i've lost probably between five and ten pounds now from when i started which is a good thing for me 

524.54 526.02 A: oh that's good 

525.95 529.60 B: um i'm trying to get back down to about a hundred and twenty a hundred and fifteen 

529.22 530.19 A: uh-huh 

529.54 541.13 B: and so i've got about um got about fifteen pounds to lose still [laughter] i'm on my way [laughter] but um i tend to exercise probably more in the summer i like to walk a lot i like to 

533.72 536.54 A: that's good yeah 

539.90 541.25 A: i do too 

541.57 552.56 B: just i mean walk around town um you know go for a jog sometimes once in a while um my daughters and i walk around a lot in fact it's so pretty out today we might end up doing that 

552.62 561.78 B: so um i think sometimes in the winter people tend to put on the weight and and exercise less because it's cold and and all that but in the winter i mean the summer 

561.60 568.85 B: i think you tend to be more active because you just wanna be out in the sun and enjoying all the flowers and you know everything out there 

568.47 569.69 A: (( [cough] right )) 

569.25 570.11 B: (( so )) 

569.73 573.70 A: i'm i do the same thing we have a we belong to a gym but 

573.81 577.10 A: we only use it during the winter months and 

575.82 576.64 B: uh-huh 

577.21 585.18 A: [laughter] not as much as what we do when in the summer comes you know the summer is just so nice and you wanna enjoy your day and not feel guilty sitting in so 

580.65 581.64 B: right 

584.56 586.17 B: right right 

585.66 592.32 A: yeah i do exercise a lot more in in the probably two to three times a week i usually get up with my neighbour every 

592.69 599.89 A: every other day we walk and then the a- the days in between we'll ride bikes in the morning and she works at seven in the morning so we get up at five [laughter] 

599.12 599.89 B: oh my god
