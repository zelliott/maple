13.98 20.33 B: yeah i know there's how about yeah why are you doing it are you just curious or is this 

20.33 25.82 A: um well it's true i got a little nervous about money but now i'm just curious um 

24.84 25.93 B: uh-huh 

25.90 29.38 A: i'm a poor student again uh my name is susan 

29.10 30.76 B: susan my name's andrew 

30.55 31.72 A: hi 

31.82 35.20 A: so we're really supposed to talk about what which is worst 

35.06 36.16 B: uh 

35.96 45.82 A: gossip smoking too much caffeine alcohol not exercising i guess what they what do they mean by which is worst morally [laughter] 

44.18 45.32 B: um 

46.29 52.44 B: i'm not sure i think it's probably just you know i'm not sure i've never done this before 

52.53 58.53 B: [laughter] either do you i guess um i'm i don't know if they said just introduce yourself and then that's it 

57.96 59.94 A: oh you didn't hear the topic 

59.39 62.91 B: i heard the topics but it we're actually supposed to talk about them 

62.29 67.69 A: oh yes i think we're actually supposed to talk about this [laughter] it's kind of funny 

66.30 67.19 B: (( uh )) 

67.28 79.74 B: i like gossiping i like caffeine i like alcohol i love it [laughter] but you know [laughter] i guess for me the worst thing for me would be uh seeing people uh over eating not exercise 

79.15 81.46 A: oh right over eating that was one 

80.87 88.44 B: frankly speaking it's not a pretty site um but that's just you know that's my 

88.75 90.73 B: take on this topic 

90.72 95.30 A: right well it would be kind of hard like i don't know what they mean by which is worst cause 

95.14 109.14 A: like being like like in a way like i love gossip and um but i but i that it's uh but i kind of feel dirty when i do it sometimes so like i sort of think it's morally can be considered morally wrong 

108.72 109.91 B: (( mhm )) 

109.24 113.61 A: where as i don't think that smoking and drinking is 

113.63 117.95 A: morally wrong necessarily although i don't do either [laughter] 

117.96 120.71 B: is that what the uh the topic 

120.03 127.95 A: no it said which what do you think is worst but i don't know if they mean physically worst then i would have to say like smoking and over eating 

122.16 123.50 B: worst right 

127.72 130.29 B: right how do you define words i i guess 

130.32 138.81 B: i just personally think yeah i would say eat over eating definitely um is the worst and not exercising is like 

138.89 143.38 B: those two in combination are the worst than smoking and exercising and you know 

143.56 150.78 A: but the also think interesting because i think your ans- like ones answer depends on how one lives or like right so do you actually exercise 

148.91 149.82 B: right 

151.57 152.48 A: do you 

152.15 153.18 B: oh yes

259.27 271.63 A: oh right so so my theory was my theory was that you would you would think differently about these topics depending on you know what you do so you think that like um 

260.60 261.88 B: so when's like 

271.70 277.28 A: um over eating and not exercising would be worst and i bet you're not over weight either

281.75 286.35 A: i don't know never mind [laughter] i was just trying to be good and talk about the topic [laughter] 

285.96 290.46 B: right so how do you make the topic end can you just go to the next topic and push the button 

289.67 292.34 A: (( no you're supposed to talk about for ten minutes )) 

291.48 293.82 B: oh for ten minutes how long has it been

306.27 307.63 B: i don't 

308.15 314.91 B: i can't talk about this topic anymore it's boring um it's just like what's up with who cares really but um

328.24 329.62 A: mhm 

328.90 340.93 B: i i think that's not pleasant but i usually don't gossip actually i don't i just kind of think i just don't find it that you know like interesting really talking about other people 

340.95 341.88 B: um 

342.82 349.81 B: unless i was personally like someone personally had injured me in some you know in some way 

350.11 355.78 B: then then i could say oh so and so they're blah blah blah cause they had um 

356.18 359.80 B: or maybe you know my character or whatever 

359.89 365.12 B: um that would mean whatever might of happened and [cough] 

365.93 371.38 B: gossiping is you know i think it probably happens a lot at work because work the work environment is 

371.48 378.84 B: it's such a strange environment where you can't confront people as you could in other situations because
