0.57 1.75 A: hello 

0.78 2.49 B: h- hello 

2.33 3.69 A: hi how are you 

3.43 5.29 B: hi my name's john 

5.04 6.52 A: hi i'm tracey 

6.14 7.49 B: hi tracey 

7.50 10.79 B: um [mn] well let's see i 

11.07 22.41 B: in in the choices the first thing that i jumped out at me was gossiping i think that gossiping is probably the most destructive of these uh traits that that they gave us 

22.96 25.91 B: and i don't know how you feel about that but uh 

26.78 33.21 A: i would have to agree that's the one that um stuck out to me because that's the one where someone else is being hurt 

32.90 47.00 B: exactly yeah drinking or smoking uh yeah i think we all know that that you're kind of destroying yourself if if you overindulge in that and uh but gossiping you're you're very correct i think gossiping is something that you're 

33.57 34.76 A: potentially 

46.96 51.06 B: uh actually going out of your way to to destroy or hurt somebody else 

50.99 63.13 A: right and and some people think well i'm not doing it to hurt anyone and i don't think people realize that they're hurting someone but they actually are um because rumors spread and people elaborate it can just be very destructive 

62.89 69.06 B: yeah a- and that's that's the truth of the that whole thing is that the elaboration that people 

69.04 80.30 B: the perception is what kills people uh if if somebody read you and i a a sentence i think that that same sentence we would both interpret it entirely different so 

80.42 88.35 B: if you're gossiping for what- whatever reason um it it has a strong possibility of coming back and snake biting you 

88.79 97.98 B: and i try not to i i don't try to even get involved in it usually i'll walk away from it but uh you know i mean 

96.07 96.90 A: right 

98.03 109.58 B: gosh [laughter] i you know i i have been a participant indirectly uh and it it's usually for me anyway i try to stay away from um 

109.94 120.39 B: names or or individuals or or you know concrete uh individuality if it's just general then then i'll go along with it uh to a degree 

120.26 121.26 A: mhm 

120.80 121.96 B: but uh 

122.31 134.94 B: yeah i i don't you know smoking drinking i'm a christian so i i don't really participate in in smoking uh i'll have a glass of wine or a beer on occasion and you know i'm not pristine by no means 

134.95 136.12 B: but uh 

136.21 139.09 B: you know that that's kind of i guess how they 

139.68 143.53 B: say that you know that's your own personal doing 

143.30 144.29 A: mhm 

144.00 144.97 B: so 

144.92 154.55 A: yeah i i could see how like maybe smoking could be seen as like you're harming other people but kind of when you see a person who's smoking you know the second hand smoke is there 

144.99 145.90 B: um 

154.38 155.39 B: mhm 

154.52 161.15 A: so you're kind of able to walk away and gossiping is like something that you have no control over as the third party 

160.82 162.06 B: right 

161.44 164.54 A: um with second hand smoking or you can walk away um 

164.81 172.29 A: you don't have to hang around with people who do choose to drink um as long as they don't get in a car 'cause then that's something completely different um 

167.72 168.62 B: right 

171.66 179.60 B: yeah no yeah i think we've probably both been in situations like that where you're in an uh enclosed environment and somebody lights up 

179.04 180.00 A: right 

179.40 192.59 B: and uh i think nowadays uh i don't know how old you are and it's probably none of my business but i'm i'm fifty two so my growing up i mean i can remember as a youth my parents smoking like chimneys in the car 

192.59 197.68 B: and uh all the way up to my young adulthood people were smoking all ar- all around me 

197.37 198.35 A: mhm 

197.90 202.22 B: and uh thank god i never even took the habit up but um 

202.45 209.16 B: nowadays it's politically incorrect to smoke so uh it it's much easier to avoid that 

208.57 222.06 A: right yeah my mum is um a smoker and yeah oh i remember we're from california so now you can't smoke in restaurants but growing up you could and so i remember when we would go out to dinner and we'd have to sit around and everyone would be smoking 

217.10 217.97 B: right 

222.42 227.08 A: and now when i travel some place else where there's smoking in restaurants i'm like ooh [laughter] 

226.80 231.78 B: yeah [laughter] are you still in california oh i am too i'm in huntington beach 

228.71 229.60 A: yes 

231.17 232.51 A: uh northridge 

232.40 235.63 B: oh okay well we're neighbors um 

233.03 233.84 A: (( northridge )) 

234.84 235.59 A: (( yeah )) 

235.88 247.61 B: so yeah that's that's the the odd thing about that and drinking kind of the same same way really i you know if you're around somebody that's uh a little too intoxicated you can walk away from that 

241.60 242.47 A: mhm 

246.95 247.90 A: right 

247.51 256.57 B: but uh yeah unfortunately um i and i those are the only three that jumped at me i i forget what else they they had mentioned in there but 

255.69 259.92 A: one was not exercising which i don't see how that would be an evil 

257.53 258.39 B: oh 

259.97 263.91 A: [laughter] that's that's kind of something you put on yourself 

259.99 261.58 B: well yeah 

263.63 265.68 B: mhm the same thing yeah 

264.92 265.86 A: yeah 

265.57 278.47 B: uh i i'm not overweight by no means yet but uh i and i don't exercise people say i look good for my age but i know that you know because i don't exercise my cardiovascular's not up to snuff 

270.54 271.36 A: uh-huh 

278.31 282.85 B: um a- again it hurts me it doesn't hurt anyone else and uh 

281.71 282.65 A: (( right [sigh] )) 

282.92 289.16 B: i think that was the uh the general consensus here was that what was the worst thing or 

289.23 293.94 B: uh you know the the most harmful thing and um again i i am 

293.89 307.81 B: this is my first time doing this so i'm i'm probably rambling but uh i'm just i'm kinda coming back to the gossiping thing is uh it just jumped out at me as being hurtful and that that was the first thing that uh i felt 

307.76 308.67 A: right 

308.97 310.00 B: but uh 

309.22 319.81 A: right 'cause i think that i think one of my things is that you shouldn't do anyone else harm um and all those other things if you choose to harm yourself then you know you have to answer to yourself but 

319.21 320.55 B: mhm 

319.88 322.57 A: yeah back to the gossiping do y- 

320.63 321.41 B: right 

321.71 323.86 B: yeah and yeah [laughter] 

324.18 328.39 B: and it usually c- you know it it ha- it is truthful because usually 

328.71 339.30 B: when you do gossip it comes back and gets you i- in the end it somehow i guess that old thing what goes around comes around and and i've known people that are 

332.64 333.27 A: mm 

339.46 347.85 B: um professional gossipers they just you know working in a clinical environment you're around a lot of um 

348.54 353.21 B: gosh i'd hate to say backstabbing people but just people that are always 

353.14 354.62 B: critiquing you 

354.30 355.24 A: mhm 

354.49 356.28 B: and uh it it's just 

356.21 370.55 B: i think that's part and parcel of any work environment is you're gonna get caught up in in a certain amount of gossiping and you just have to know when to walk away and and when not to really get uh involved in in input 

370.62 371.83 B: but uh 

370.91 371.74 A: yeah 

371.78 378.78 A: i th- yeah i think people uh probably gossip too much i think you shouldn't really say anything that you wouldn't say to that person's face 

378.56 379.43 B: right 

378.80 392.83 A: um and a lot of people that's their time when they do say things and i understand like venting there were times when you won't believe what this person did to me and that kind of thing but then that person that you tell it to can take it to someone else and it just becomes a big rumor mill 

392.59 395.13 B: mhm and i think wha- [mn] under 

393.17 394.13 A: not good 

395.13 396.25 B: uh 

396.15 399.82 B: the stress or the duress of of that emotion 

399.69 411.81 B: uh yeah you certainly do you vent and and a lot of times you don't realize that you're you're gossiping but indirectly you are because a- and that's you're absolutely right somebody else can take that and say 

405.49 406.35 A: right 

412.38 421.38 B: she said they did this to them and then she said this about so and so and you know it it can really escalate into an ugly affair 

421.06 421.92 A: (( mhm right )) 

421.84 422.73 B: that's 

422.86 424.96 B: you know a- again um 

426.21 439.57 B: i don't know it's you know if i were perfect then i i would be able to sit on the thrown but uh you know i've been probably privy to as much gossip as anyone else and just through the years have learned that uh 

439.74 445.54 B: you know it hurts you regardless and the interpretation is is the key 

445.53 454.99 B: you know nobody really understands where you're coming from and for them to try and interpret what you're saying can uh often lead to a even a bigger mess 

454.64 455.65 A: right 

457.77 463.01 B: but uh okay so no exercising [laughter] no smoking uh 

463.44 465.31 B: do you drink 

464.92 466.98 A: um occasionally 

466.54 478.87 B: yeah okay yeah i i think i think that's uh in today's society i think that's acceptable as long as like you say you don't uh or i was saying y- y- you don't over abuse it uh 

467.56 468.45 A: yeah 

478.04 483.54 A: right yeah i think the only place where it becomes evil is when you get behind a wheel 

483.35 484.31 B: mhm 

483.67 491.04 A: of an of a vehicle i was hit by a drunk driver so um knowing that you know that affected my life and so 

490.19 491.09 B: mhm 

491.20 494.15 A: then that then that person did affect me 

494.87 501.60 A: where if they had just stayed at home and chose to drink that wouldn't have been a problem i wouldn't have had a problem with it 

498.04 499.02 B: mhm 

499.64 500.44 B: right 

501.59 513.80 B: yeah unfortunately um you know accident happen and w- i was just talking to somebody about that and they said there's no such thing as an accident th- that it's actually you're uh 

514.28 520.03 B: you're pushing the envelope in some way you're either trying to get away with something or you're trying to 

516.54 517.42 A: uh-huh 

520.01 525.98 B: uh get somewhere faster than you need be or you know it's always uh the individual's 

525.91 539.05 B: uh miscalculation or um irresponsibility that leads to an accident i i kinda disagree because in your case there's an example you were the recipient of somebody else's uh negligence 

538.69 539.63 A: right 

539.30 540.64 B: and uh so 

540.87 543.20 B: that that's a tough call uh 

543.54 545.75 B: i don't know uh exactly 

544.77 559.49 A: [noise] and for a lot of people that i know who believe like in the fate thing and that everything happens for a reason it's just when you're on the the short end of the stick it's really hard to see that this is what was supposed to happen and there's good to come from it [laughter] 

557.57 558.56 B: mhm 

558.84 567.72 B: is there good that comes from that though you know that's sometimes i i wonder i'm going through a divorce and that's why i'm back in home in california 

560.45 561.81 A: [laughter] 

568.08 570.04 B: california again and uh 

570.19 583.03 B: you know i i keep again my faith tells me to to look for the answer you know and and i'm like i can't find it you know i've been here since january i i'm still looking for employment uh 

577.42 578.30 A: mhm 

582.98 586.34 B: you know i've got backgrounds i've got a you know 

587.31 593.83 B: i'm i'm very marketable but in this day and age it it's it's very hard right now you know 

593.09 595.01 A: the economy yeah 

594.28 597.23 B: yeah the economy's just terrible and uh 

597.49 599.95 B: so having said that you know y-
