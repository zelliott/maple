0.00 0.98 B: hello 

0.64 2.97 A: hi my name's bob 

2.89 4.33 B: hi i'm andrew 

4.21 8.82 A: andrew okay did you catch all the ah criteria 

8.62 14.99 B: um i i caught some of it not all of it something about which which do you think is worse and ah 

14.84 18.55 A: yeah ah alcohol smoking um 

18.88 20.01 A: um 

20.10 22.15 A: not exercising 

22.19 24.34 A: ah what else was there there 

25.70 26.83 B: i don't know 

27.39 28.54 A: okay 

28.71 34.14 A: all right well i okay then i guess we've got three smoking 

34.55 41.48 A: alcohol or not exercising w- we have to decide which is worse 

38.22 39.49 B: ah 

41.35 42.91 B: which is worse 

42.92 44.11 B: (( um )) 

44.60 56.76 B: well personally i think ah a combination of ah smoking and consuming alcohol i- is worse i mean 

56.83 61.38 B: a- alcohol i don't think is is that bad every once in a while you know ah 

61.03 68.83 A: right in other words yeah modern medicine says that an occasional drink of ah so many ounces of ah 

68.85 70.58 A: (( ah liquor )) 

69.97 71.14 B: (( wine )) 

70.68 72.03 A: or wine 

71.32 73.31 B: is good for your heart yeah 

72.45 74.34 A: is good for you 

74.40 87.88 A: and of course ah the extension of that is al- alcoholism which is is ah extremely detrimental um probably would you agree more detrimental than ah smoking 

88.29 90.25 B: um yes yes 

90.07 94.29 A: although lung cancer [laughter] ah 

95.29 103.39 A: is is probably worse than alcoholism which eventually effects the ah the ah liver yeah so 

95.32 96.37 B: (( i would well )) 

100.56 101.46 B: liver 

103.52 108.43 A: ah and then you're going to have ah die of liver um um whatever it is 

107.98 113.10 B: failure yeah i i think ah i think you're 

113.71 114.80 B: um 

115.06 122.70 B: more likely to get liver damage than than to get lung cancer i mean i've known people who've smoked for years and years you 

121.82 124.04 A: (( yeah )) 

124.26 126.75 A: well okay in 

127.25 132.78 A: in talking about habits um did you ever smoke 

132.75 138.04 B: know ah i smoked once ah as a younger kid i 

137.55 150.88 A: yeah well i smoked for years and i spent many years trying to quit in fact i say somewhat facetiously andrew i'm a expert on quitting because i quit so many times before i finally made it 

148.83 149.87 B: oh yeah 

150.84 157.32 A: and ah it was the hardest thing i ever had to do of course i've never been an alcoholic you see 

150.97 152.31 B: yeah 

157.20 158.25 B: yeah 

157.74 162.71 A: so i guess ah i couldn't make a comparison there um 

163.43 171.28 A: when i drink it isn't ah habit forming at all for me ah while i know that nicotine was 

171.05 172.85 B: yeah 

171.90 177.20 A: and ah well we may as well touch on the do you exercise i do every day 

177.21 186.83 B: ah no i i don't make it a point to exercise but i mean i i walk i i walk almost like everywhere i go um 

182.40 183.37 A: oh 

186.49 193.57 A: ah huh well it depends on how fast you're walking because y- y- the object there is to get aerobic 

187.64 188.63 B: so 

194.03 196.08 B: yeah 

195.11 207.93 A: and unless you're huffing and puffing um that's not really exercise it's sort of like a lot of people think that tennis is exercise when it really isn't because there's too many stops and starts 

207.91 213.54 A: in the game so your heart rate goes back to a more normal ah 

213.79 223.38 A: pace when you're say at the net playing doubles or waiting for the other person to serve or whatever there's there's quite a few respites and ah 

223.59 234.86 A: to get really the benefit of exercise you have to stay at a higher level for a a sustained period of time and ah 

235.36 244.23 A: like if you're walking in a city you have to wait for a stop light or something that that would ah somewhat ruin the benefit of the exercise 

244.66 248.97 B: yeah well in that case i no i really do not make it a point to exercise 

248.65 249.39 A: yeah 

249.46 259.07 A: um 'course it ah i put weights on my ankles and i carry weights in my hands when i ah power walk 

259.12 265.99 A: power walk is just throwing your arms up and really let's say going as fast as you can walk 

266.08 268.42 A: and it's interesting because 

268.88 274.36 A: i had a a good friend explain to me a a minister friend of mine who said 

274.25 286.26 A: ah he had to quit running and ah i kind of teased him about that and he said no wait a minute he said why don't you try speed walking and i said what do you mean power walking and he said try to walk as fast as you can 

286.55 301.09 A: and the idea is that the human body as a machine is more efficient at running than it is at walking fast and so you stress the body more by ah walking as fast as you possibly can 

301.11 304.99 A: is is harder on the body than it is running 

304.69 306.61 B: (( right yeah i i i think that's true )) 

306.33 315.69 A: so ah it's the way the machine was built so [laughter] i i went into walking because there is less pounding ah on the total body 

306.75 308.40 B: (( ah yeah )) 

315.61 322.45 A: skeleton when ah your not running and being seventy two years old why ah 

318.90 319.73 B: (( mhm )) 

322.46 325.95 A: you reach a point where you want to protect some of those things 

326.50 334.70 A: yeah but it it is a certain amount of discomfort or pain ah while you're doing it and the next day 

334.72 345.69 A: ah recovery time when you get up in the morning you hurt a little bit and that's just pretty standard ah there's there's never a real panacea of of 

345.87 347.60 A: time to exercise 

347.65 351.37 A: i mean i started at forty how old are you andrew 

351.08 353.14 B: mhm i'm actually seventeen 

353.74 355.18 A: seventeen 

354.87 356.44 B: yeah 

355.93 360.37 A: well you see you haven't even reached the point the thought yet of ah 

360.39 362.76 A: what's really important in life 

363.86 366.31 B: but um well as far as what 

365.99 368.08 A: oh how long you want to live 

368.49 370.32 A: (( i mean and and )) 

368.56 369.64 B: oh 

370.29 372.69 A: th- that's an important thing to decide 

372.53 373.59 B: what y- 

372.67 376.91 A: there's lots of things about you know there's the the physical and the 

376.76 390.65 A: and the mental and the spiritual side of life and and ah those are the basic three and if you want to get into the physical side and you decide you really want to live a long time ah you gotta pay the price along the way you 

389.85 391.00 B: (( naturally )) 

390.77 393.69 A: have to put an input in in order to have 

393.73 396.09 A: the later years you know 

395.98 400.70 B: yeah well i'm i'm anticipating my death in my forties only because ah 

396.59 398.05 A: (( an- )) 

401.04 406.19 B: because every one in my family has heart problems and they've all been dying in their forties so mm mhm mhm 

405.46 409.13 A: yeah well if you start right now on c. o. two ten 

409.61 424.26 A: ah which you can buy at any health food store and you start realizing that ah ah certain types of oils that you use and can take and ah if you get on a good omega three oil 

424.27 438.22 A: and if you take c. o. two ten and don't smoke too much and and get exercise every day you can probably take that that expectancy of life maybe to sixty sixty five or better 

439.35 449.16 A: there's another thing you can do too you can get a book on cayenne pepper and if you were to take cayenne pepper every day it would keep the whole circulatory system 

449.04 457.15 A: in much better shape easier on the heart no high blood pressure there's there's a ton of things you can do if you really want to live 

457.87 468.04 A: so i know my mom and d- dad both had heart ah problems too um and so ah but it wasn't until i was in my 

468.13 479.20 A: mm- mid forties that that came to light to me so i started at forty five on what you could now start off at seventeen eighteen to doing 

479.11 485.94 A: um you really could have a life expectancy of ninety to a hundred but you'd have to work at it 

485.95 490.20 A: and it's well worth it depending on on how you value life you know 

490.15 502.59 A: a lot of people really don't care ah and life doesn't mean that much to them and ah so they say oh well i'm going to enjoy this and that and the other thing and not look at the long range picture 

502.81 504.07 A: (( but ah )) 

504.53 510.92 A: looking at the long range picture ah doing something with a discipline to it every day 

511.62 516.41 A: only is going to embellish all the other things you have to do like study or 

516.54 523.17 A: um if you have to go in the military there's a certain discipline there that you have to have and ah 

523.47 529.36 A: ah that's what's really missing ah in most young people today is a sense of discipline 

529.41 530.78 A: they never 

530.94 537.72 A: they were never forced into it i mean like how many times how many spankings did you get as a 

538.12 540.51 B: [laughter] um 

538.54 541.68 A: (( kid )) 

540.61 543.59 B: i honestly couldn't tell you i i don't remember 

544.11 548.31 A: oh well i'm okay you don't remember ever being spanked 

548.16 552.17 B: oh no of course i remember being spanked i just don't remember how many times 

551.55 552.79 A: oh okay 

552.84 557.36 A: all right well then then then you you had some parents that gave you tough love 

557.19 558.41 B: (( yeah )) 

557.88 570.53 A: okay that's good yeah no no so um al- l- a lot of people never experience that and they don't know what don't or do not means you know 

558.80 560.97 B: (( nothing wrong with that yeah )) 

570.43 571.55 B: yeah 

571.02 578.60 A: and ah then you get on your own and you have to apply it to yourself you know you nearly have to spank yourself in order to 

578.67 585.42 A: do the right thing so anyway we better get back to alcohol and smoking um 

585.44 599.89 A: if you don't smoking is a very insidious habit i- it sneaks up on you i guess alcohol is is too but you know it's hard to pour yourself a drink in the middle of work or school or whatever you're doing you have to wait till
