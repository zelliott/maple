11.18 15.02 B: (( uh do you actually remember the question that they asked earlier on )) 

14.01 18.99 A: yeah they they want us to talk about getting a cold and the change of seasons 

18.33 20.08 B: okay actually um 

20.57 23.48 B: who wants to start do you want to start first or maybe i start first 

23.12 24.49 A: oh you go ahead 

24.02 27.55 B: oh okay they were talking about seasonal changes and how 

27.88 29.29 B: illnesses right 

29.57 32.99 B: okay for myself for this particular winter which is very brutal 

33.46 36.64 B: i'm pretty lucky in the sense that i haven't gotten sick at all 

36.88 38.42 A: oh that's good 

38.22 52.45 B: but but the thing is it affects me in a way in terms of my sleeping habits is like i got tired more easily you know and things like that so yeah i don't get a cold surprisingly because i'm actually yeah mm 

47.27 48.22 A: (( hm )) 

52.34 59.93 B: not a- american citizen i was like from somewhere hot and uh i suppose how do i keep myself 

60.36 63.40 B: from not getting the illnesses i suppose 

63.48 75.11 B: i i you know i make sure i have a balanced diet i try to sleep well you know you know like if it's raining i try to avoid the rain and things like that i mean just some basic common sense i think yeah how 'bout yourself 

75.03 82.90 A: oh i think that sounds pretty much like me too i uh i take a handful of vitamins every day i very seldom get sick 

77.42 79.26 B: [laughter] okay 

82.93 87.27 A: and the change of weather doesn't affect me too much either i uh 

83.28 84.18 B: okay 

87.12 88.92 B: okay that's great 

87.63 90.24 A: i adjust to it pretty well 

89.68 90.60 B: okay 

90.44 95.69 A: and uh i got to get my sleep i do know i got to have sleep and i found that 

95.62 109.60 A: i have to do what the bible says and have one day of rest a week because if i don't get one good day of rest then by the end of that week i probably will get sick i'll either get sick or have s- some emotional crisis in my life so 

109.57 110.75 B: oh okay 

109.78 120.05 A: i've found that i have to have one day where i don't do any kind of work at all if it's not sunday another day of the week just i got to have a day of rest one time a week 

119.49 120.79 B: oh okay 

120.09 124.55 A: and so that's really helped me to stay well i found over the years 

124.39 127.47 B: do you really feel that an apple a day keep a doctor away 

128.00 129.06 A: um 

129.29 136.51 A: i think uh that's probably just another way of saying you know you need to eat proper and have good food and yeah i do i'm 

136.40 148.08 A: i'm a kind of a health food nut i i eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables and uh i don't eat any processed food and right now i'm on a low carbohydrate diet so i'm 

138.84 140.02 B: oh are you really 

147.10 148.54 B: oh oh 

147.90 154.01 A: not eating anything with any sugar in it or any grains i'm completely off grain right now 

153.84 159.81 B: oh okay i mean well you seem like more health conscious than i do actually because um 

159.98 165.66 B: i i don't really like not into diet things like that because hello i am here no so 

162.35 163.24 A: hello 

163.51 166.19 A: yes i'm still here heard a click

169.29 170.28 A: yes 

169.73 181.56 B: yeah okay sure um well it's well i don't know for for a guy you know i suppose for the g- all the guys i've met so far uh you know i think you you must be the most one of the 

181.87 185.02 B: most health conscious one i've ever met actually 

184.37 189.32 A: well i'd i'd like to live to be an old man and i don't want to have cancer when i die 

188.89 190.33 B: oh okay 

189.72 199.75 A: you know and you hear all these crazy things about uh er you know if you live long enough in america you're either gonna get breast cancer or prostate cancer 

199.41 200.73 B: uh yeah that's 

199.77 206.77 A: and i think that's terrible and i think it's something in our diet and in our food that's doing that to us so i've just 

205.49 218.18 B: awful yeah i won yeah one thing actually because like i say i'm not american citizen but i've been here for a while and it seems that like for example you go into a supermarket i've just realized that convenience store is like 

218.31 222.35 B: what people is eating and i was thinking to myself this is very unhealthy 

221.61 222.88 A: it's terrible 

223.38 225.82 B: and but i think like maybe the 

226.18 230.24 B: people here the local you know just like something fast and quick 

230.42 235.08 B: so i think this is where all this frozen food in the food mart you know business is booming yeah but 

234.12 240.67 A: yeah well look at how fat americans are have you noticed how many fat people there are in america isn't it disgusting 

238.39 240.24 B: yeah it's terrible

276.74 280.00 B: oh okay okay oh oh 

280.29 286.11 B: oh okay i think we ha- we go back to the topics what else did they ask actually i didn't 

283.41 284.23 A: yeah 

285.24 293.91 A: so yeah we the cold thing you know i i i guess with this uh sars that's going around singapore has been hit with the sars too you know that 

294.17 308.82 A: we need to keep our immune system up and uh anything that runs our immune system down not sleeping too much sugar and you know chemicals in our body is something that's going to make us more susceptible to getting sick 

296.87 297.75 B: yeah 

308.47 312.10 B: yeah do you actually do detoxification stuff like 

311.26 312.67 A: yes i do 

312.17 316.10 B: oh oh my goodness you're really you're really into it yeah 

313.39 314.71 A: yes i do 

315.39 322.67 A: yeah and bowel cleansing too bowel cleansing is very good to help keep you healthy 'cause all those toxins build up in your intestines 

322.07 327.52 B: (( do you also do exercise also like yoga or just judo regular gym )) 

327.15 333.53 A: no i'll tell you what i work construction for a living so i get a lot of exercise during the day 

333.17 334.90 B: oh okay 

333.79 348.02 A: so i'm always lifting and moving i'm not a sedentary person i don't sit at a desk i'm always uh burning lots of calories so i don't really have to watch my weight i can eat as much as i want and not gain weight 

335.64 336.66 B: very good 

340.32 341.48 B: oh okay 

347.72 352.81 B: oh same here i can eat as much as i want without gaining the weight but for me it's um 

350.76 351.64 A: mhm 

352.70 358.81 B: (( i don't exercise a lot actually but but you see actually when i came here it was like in autu- autumn )) 

358.64 370.63 B: so the weather is not so the weather then was quite nice so actually i normally jog in the morning early morning but when winter comes and you know like after sep- after november when the we- when the weather starts to turn cold 

363.43 364.32 A: uh-huh 

370.05 371.12 A: mhm 

370.53 376.58 B: for me so i stop exercising and i don't like to go to gym so i need to go outdoors to do my exercise actually 

376.31 377.28 A: mhm 

376.68 382.28 B: yeah and so i think i will be starting it pretty soon maybe end of next week or what yeah i will do my 

382.45 384.05 B: my dose of exercise 

383.59 389.97 A: well i think when you go out in the cold weather i think it actually helps you be strong from not getting sick 

389.45 391.91 B: yeah yeah true yes in a way yeah 

391.24 401.86 A: breathing fresh air and it makes your body more hardened towards that and as long as you take care of yourself and you dress properly i think it's good to go out in the cold weather in the wintertime 

401.25 406.48 B: but you know the problem with me is that was from singapore i'm from singapore so the you know 

406.72 407.93 A: it's hard on you 

406.73 417.43 B: it's always yeah it's always hard and the problem is that i i don't mind the cold i like winter actually the problems is when the wind blows on my face it is terrible 

409.38 410.20 A: yeah 

417.56 427.82 B: i don't like look i think i keep my body warm that's not the issue the issue is my face because my you know it gets dry so uh it's terrible it's the wind i think actually 

427.52 430.85 A: yeah you put moisturizer on your face 

427.99 428.94 B: yeah 

430.26 440.49 B: yes but the thing is my skin is very very dry it dries very fast yeah yeah i have very very dry skin so that's the thing that kills me actually i think 

434.65 435.51 A: huh 

440.27 441.11 A: (( mm )) 

440.85 445.16 B: yeah but like i s- but what you say i agree that actually 

445.12 457.21 B: in the cold right when the cold wind you know blows across your face actually you feel more refreshed and in a way you build up your immunity because back home right when i was in singapore i always have cold two times a year 

456.80 457.93 A: really 

457.38 465.92 B: yeah that is why when i first came came come came here i was a bit worried i was thinking oh my goodness like in december i'm going to get a cold or flu but it doesn't happen 

466.05 467.49 A: well that's good 

466.91 470.02 B: yeah i think like it must be the weather that's being you know where 

469.70 482.16 A: you you know they say i grew up in the northern part of america and when everything's frozen there's no virus or or germs can survive not until it starts to warm up then they become active again 

481.75 484.46 B: did you where did you stay alaska no right 

484.88 487.36 A: no i was in uh ohio 

485.38 486.11 B: (( northern )) 

487.35 489.08 B: oh okay 

487.93 490.41 A: cleveland ohio where i grew up 

489.62 495.03 B: yeah it's very cold because what my roommate one of them used to study there so she was telling me 

495.52 502.46 B: the winter there is very brutal because i was complaining to her about the winter here she's like here is nothing compared to what i have gone through 

497.17 498.10 A: yeah 

502.13 503.12 A: yeah 

502.55 504.71 B: yeah oh okay mhm 

503.18 510.60 A: yeah well you know one of the other tricks i found to to battle the cold if you do get a cold is drink lots of water 

510.41 521.11 B: oh oh yes that reminds me that is if i'm going to come down with the flu or cold right i normally take those you know effervescent tablets like those one of the milligram of vitamin c 

520.53 522.06 A: mhm 

521.31 522.57 B: it really helps 

522.40 533.15 A: yes it does they've got these er zinc c. lozenges that are supposed to be very good but you know what i don't do i never go to the doctor and i never take antibiotics 

523.10 524.13 B: yeah 

527.41 528.47 B: mhm 

533.17 539.83 A: most of the colds are viral in nature and the antibiotics won't do any good anyhow unless you have secondary infections 

538.72 549.44 B: yeah true i don't do antibiotics for my flu and cold also not even for fever yeah no no such thing yeah you don't need that actually in fact a good doctor would not recommend that to you 

540.11 540.87 A: so 

542.02 543.93 A: no why bother no 

549.54 550.98 A: yeah you're right 

551.45 560.57 A: but most doctors do they just say here here's a prescription go home call me in a week and of course your body's going to fight it off and in a week you're going to be better anyway 

553.51 554.25 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

560.22 561.86 B: (( here it is [laughter] )) 

560.91 564.19 A: if you even if you didn't take the things you'd be getting better 

563.63 565.93 B: yeah because like fluids you know 

566.23 579.17 B: you know if it's not if there's no underlying disease or serious illness basically they can go by themselves you don't actually need to to take all those chemicals into your body and that your body will have to start you know getting rid of that yeah 

572.34 573.36 A: yeah 

578.60 583.00 A: yeah you're better off keeping your immune system strong and uh there's 

583.13 585.78 A: echinacea have you ever taken echinacea 

585.38 587.60 B: mm no what is that 

587.03 594.89 A: echinacea is it's a native wild flower to america and it has the effect of stimulating your immune system 

594.29 596.07 B: oh i didn't know that okay 

595.17 599.95 A: yeah they sell it in tea form and you can buy it in dried capsules and any of the
