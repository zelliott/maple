43.38 44.68 A: oh okay 

44.57 48.11 B: so that's kind of an easy for people to locate us but uh 

48.19 56.72 B: yeah i i was uh i don't know if the uh topic was kind of difficult but uh i was often ill in quincy [laughter] 

48.44 49.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

56.01 57.04 A: [laughter] 

57.67 62.81 B: yeah actually i was sick quite a bit growing up um kind of had like uh 

62.85 66.47 B: you know that's they mention like change of seasons in the topic 

66.24 67.31 A: mhm 

67.14 76.47 B: i'm not sure i got all of the topics that they mentioned but i mentioned the change they mentioned the change in the seasons well i was one of those kids who got like uh bronchitis pneumonia stuff like that 

76.01 77.33 A: yeah 

76.72 81.75 B: at the change of seasons so but it seems like i've outgrown a lot of that so 

81.65 82.50 A: (( ha )) 

81.88 83.91 B: yeah but 

82.70 94.99 A: that's not so bad because i think i noticed it most i i think it's interesting that they did mention change of seasons 'cause i i think that's very true for me it's more like allergies and sort of like flu not really i don't know not 

94.82 100.20 A: not like a real you know big sickness but i did notice it most when i when i um 

98.18 99.81 B: [noise] 

100.21 102.11 A: when i moved but when i 

101.64 102.83 B: [noise] 

102.39 113.56 A: not just uh like change of seasons but actually like where i was moving to when i was in college i got more sick there from like living in a different location and stuff like that 

113.36 114.41 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

114.43 115.32 A: so 

115.95 118.68 A: which is interesting but act- actually um 

118.81 125.70 A: the topic i thought was interesting 'cause i'm uh i'm a wellness consultant and what i see is yeah 

123.38 124.72 B: you're a wellness co- 

124.77 127.53 B: you're a wellness consul wow that's interesting 

127.00 133.98 A: well and i work for a company that researches and develops health and wellness products that are actually designed to 

134.20 139.01 A: help prevent sickness as opposed to a company that treats it 

135.93 136.92 B: uh-huh 

138.92 139.89 B: okay 

138.99 152.96 A: so [laughter] yeah so i mean we're we're more focussed on prevention i think maybe one of the things they said one of the topics was something like you know what do you do to like when you get sick and stuff so i thought that was interesting 'cause like now actually 

150.25 151.43 B: yeah 

152.83 160.62 A: you know i'm focussed more on what i can do to prevent myself from getting sick rather than like you know curing it once i get sick so [laughter] 

160.02 163.98 B: yeah and well i think that there is a future move to that right now 

163.96 164.93 A: yeah 

164.04 167.64 B: a lot of people might call it alternative medicine or whatever 

166.99 168.38 A: mhm mhm 

167.65 178.12 B: but uh yeah i think i think that the emphasis now is on prevention and preventative medicine and you know i don't care some for some people it might be vitamins for some people it's uh 

178.20 181.67 B: a you know you know all this a lot better than i do 

182.07 183.11 B: so 

182.07 189.71 A: yeah well yeah what my what my company does is we basically specialize in like four different areas one is sleep 'cause a lot of people um 

190.00 199.30 A: have a lot of stress because they don't sleep properly and they say stress is like the number one you know killer cause of heart attacks and things like that in the united states 

192.68 193.67 B: uh-huh 

199.32 213.93 A: um another one we do specialize in is nutritionals like vitamins and things like that um and then we also do things like environment which focuses mainly on water um the kind of water that people um drink and how that can help their body 

203.88 204.84 B: okay 

214.02 223.09 A: fight off disease and the other one is uh is fitness and basically like just staying in shape and things like that also helps prevent disease so 

215.53 216.48 B: uh-huh 

222.48 229.35 B: wow that's so interesting so what is your involvement in all of this you're working for them you're working for them right 

224.33 225.30 A: yeah 

226.15 226.90 A: what 

228.51 235.32 A: [mn] yeah well what it what it is i'm b- i'm considered self employed with um like an independent contractor like a wellness contractor 

232.22 233.14 B: okay 

234.43 235.93 B: oh yeah 

235.50 242.90 A: and um but basically what i do is the company it started in japan and it grew they're in like thirty two different countries now 

242.76 256.54 A: and um and as a basically it's just a lot of people that work through the company so the company provides like you know the products that they research and develop for us to go out and um basically a kind of like people have like a doctor 

256.44 262.01 A: it's sort of like they also have like a wellness consultant and what i do is like we'd go and build um 

256.61 257.56 B: okay 

262.09 271.86 A: like a wellness home for someone and describe the different products and things and how they would uh you know improve their life style and uh things like that so [laughter] 

271.89 278.95 B: wow oh so you uh you'll go into people's home to talk about their uh living style and their eating and all of this stuff 

278.84 287.75 A: yeah sort of like you know it's basically a lot through through word of mouth just talking to people and um you know and finding out like oh i don't sleep right or uh like 

287.55 301.67 A: i don't have this i don't do this and um yeah basically just showing them different ways that they can that they can improve that as well as like building a business with it so like you know i tell people about that and then i train other people how to do the same thing 

301.51 304.87 B: wow so you're m- able to make a living doing that 

304.26 310.99 A: [mn] oh yeah yeah definitely it's um it's it's really cool i just started actually a couple of months ago and um 

305.52 306.77 B: wow 

310.85 324.56 A: it's a lot of fun yeah it's a lot of fun um 'cause you just build like a lot of good like relationships with the people and um you know it's something that like it's a type of product that really changes people's lives and so it i think that 

310.91 312.48 B: no kidding 

322.74 324.51 B: mhm 

324.50 328.11 A: you know obviously people are appreciative of that you know and uh 

328.08 341.57 A: i i mean i've heard a lot of stories and met a lot of people that you know were going to have go and get like surgery for this or this or this and because they use one of our products now you know the problems they've had for twenty years have gone away in like a month so 

340.75 347.45 B: wow you know i i i've read about stuff like that and then they don't need their surgery or anything anymore do they 

347.59 354.26 A: yeah no it's it's it's really really um you know um fascinating and a lot of people you know in my 

354.02 365.71 A: in my family a lot of them have had like cancer and you know and and different problems like that so that kind of interested me 'cause i was like well you know if i can show them a product that can help them get better prevent this 

365.51 371.06 A: you know i think that would be uh so basically the goal of the company their vision is to um 

371.34 379.45 A: is to basically um you know influence and change like worldwide wellness they're in thirty two countries right now their goal is to be in over two hundred so 

379.04 392.90 B: wow well i hope it gets to the point where uh more health care coverages and things like that will c- will cover it because uh most health care most of of that coverage and insurance is all geared towards um 

393.22 403.18 B: you know once you're sick as opposed to preventative and uh so if if you're on the ball and aware of the stuff it's all out of pocket and it can be uh 

395.37 397.86 A: (( mm exactly )) 

402.18 402.98 A: (( yeah mm )) 

403.08 408.19 B: um i i i i've uh can't say i i know a lot about it i've done some reading and uh 

408.08 420.74 B: i guess it's uh i do what i can but a lot of it comes down to if i if i had more money and had more time i might be able to do more with it but most of those things are out of pocket expenses 'cause a lot of uh you know a lot of 

420.63 427.63 B: uh claims just won't cover that kind of stuff which is too bad 'cause in the long run we we'd all save so much more money 

427.33 431.25 A: yeah we really would it's it's funny because um 

427.77 428.82 B: we will 

431.57 443.13 A: japan is the number one healthiest country in the world and they spend eighty five percent of their um dollars you know in the you know for health on prevention and fifteen percent on 

443.03 456.63 A: um you know symptoms and sickness and united in the united states the forty third healthiest country in the world and they spend only fifteen percent on prevention and eighty five percent on 

445.59 446.71 B: (( mhm )) 

456.59 460.19 A: (( you know trying to cure things and symptoms they can )) 

458.92 461.99 B: yeah there yeah there's an obvious correlation there 

460.81 471.87 A: very big difference yeah yeah it's it's interesting um if you ever get a chance read the book it's called uh the next trillion it's by um paul zane um pilsners 

462.69 464.15 B: (( oh it's huge [mn] )) 

471.76 473.60 B: the ne- the next trillion 

473.48 474.63 A: yeah 

474.28 475.32 B: okay 

474.74 482.44 A: and um it's really it's really all about like the health care industry and basically um and wellness and what you 

478.87 479.90 B: okay 

481.35 482.23 B: uh-huh 

482.28 491.34 A: what he's saying in the book is that the next trillion dollar industry is going to be the wellness industry it's focussed upon prevention yeah and he actually 

487.98 489.30 B: wow 

490.16 492.93 B: so you're right in you're right in on that wave then 

491.96 504.30 A: [laughter] yeah yeah there's all this it's all focussed around like the baby boomer generation like like yeah 'cause that's you know majority of of people it's like every eight seconds like someone turns fifty or something like that so 

497.59 498.51 B: mhm 

503.43 504.95 B: (( mhm )) 

504.27 512.62 A: um and you know a big thing that they're focussed on now is you know trying to stay young eating healthy preventative you know although most of them are 

512.67 518.37 A: more focussed on things like that now 'cause they don't like you know getting older and aging and things like that so 

518.19 519.42 B: right 

518.76 523.39 A: but um yeah it's it's a very interesting it's very fascinating and um 

523.69 533.46 A: to read al- also it kind of explains in there a little bit about how the health care industry works as far as a lot of times what they do with the coverage that employees get 

532.88 534.19 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

533.50 536.99 A: is that they they only treat the symptoms and not 

536.13 537.40 B: (( right [noise] )) 

537.21 544.09 A: so that they can go back to work but they don't cover it enough so that they actually get completely better [laughter] 

539.13 540.30 B: right 

542.53 543.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

543.87 545.97 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm exactly )) 

545.42 556.48 A: so by the time that they retire from their company you know they might end up getting cancer you know [laughter] and it affects their lives but their employer doesn't care anymore because they're not paying for it you know 

550.35 553.10 B: mhm oh it's it's just 

556.01 560.99 B: exactly hey you said you you have allergies and stuff you said 

556.56 557.37 A: so 

557.39 558.38 A: (( but yeah )) 

560.67 562.77 A: oh yes definitely [laughter] 

562.11 567.72 B: yeah 'cause i have allergies so did you find stuff that that's good for that or how how do you treat yourself 

566.49 567.45 A: oh 

567.91 568.47 A: (( um )) 

568.49 581.47 A: yeah basically you see mine kind go like in and out i guess it depends upon you know what they were saying changing of the seasons and the type and the like time of the year and everything but actually one of i have noticed a little bit of difference this 

581.52 584.42 A: this year because one of our um 

584.44 598.06 A: nutritional products it's called immunity and it basically does like just what it says it kind of builds up your immune system and somehow it affects something like that to do with my sinuses too and i haven't noticed it being as 

587.38 588.50 B: (( mhm )) 

595.99 597.88 B: mhm 

597.85 599.55 A: bad as it usually is 

599.34 599.89 B: (( mhm ))
