9.20 10.35 B: (( uh piav )) 

10.88 12.55 A: i'm sorry can you say that again 

12.20 13.34 B: (( sure piav )) 

13.71 15.14 A: okay um 

15.29 17.01 A: have you ever done this before 

16.92 18.50 B: yesterday i did 

18.49 20.93 A: okay i haven't this is my first one 

20.69 26.12 B: okay did you h- hear what they said the topic was like several things right 

21.11 22.53 A: (( so i just )) 

25.61 26.51 A: uh-huh 

26.17 28.71 B: uh what were they overeating 

28.23 30.46 A: (( gossiping um )) 

31.61 38.01 A: smoking overeating not exercising or using alcohol or caffeine to excess which is worse 

37.87 39.89 B: or caffeine to what 

39.59 42.53 A: or alcohol or caffeine to excess which 

42.42 44.26 B: oh caffeine to excess okay 

44.06 49.16 A: yeah which is worse i guess it would be my first question would be worse for whom 

50.68 56.68 B: well i i i guess i'd start off with the personal self then go on to the 

53.52 54.67 A: yeah 

55.04 55.93 A: yeah i 

57.36 59.15 B: like the second hand 

58.87 67.31 A: yeah i guess you know my quest- my my question would be worse for whom uh me personally your family or society in general 

59.33 60.13 B: (( right )) 

68.16 69.05 B: okay 

69.07 70.21 B: so 

70.47 74.52 B: with that in mind what would you say is the worst 

74.55 75.33 A: (( [sigh] )) 

75.77 79.65 A: that that's really that's really a tough one i would probably have to say 

80.95 83.42 A: alcohol consumption excessively 

84.91 85.80 B: okay 

85.67 87.81 A: because that that can just destroy 

87.89 94.60 A: your personal life and the lives of your family and it's it's destructive to your health 

94.72 99.72 A: uh you could hurt other people while driving intoxicated uh 

100.89 104.28 A: you know it it could impact your job situation 

104.34 105.17 B: uh-huh 

105.18 106.12 A: so 

106.60 114.77 A: i guess all the other things could have negative impact too in all areas of your life but it would seem to me that alcohol consumption excessively 

114.50 115.37 B: uh-huh 

115.80 120.77 A: you know i it would would impact all areas of your life 

115.92 117.62 B: right exactly i 

120.54 121.89 B: (( right right )) 

121.99 122.88 A: (( yeah )) 

122.09 123.17 B: uh 

123.62 125.32 A: at least that's kinda 

123.95 127.71 B: and uh yeah and uh i would say 

125.41 126.49 A: my opinion 

128.84 131.66 B: to a similar degree of alcohol 

131.84 133.70 B: smoking should be included 

133.53 138.20 A: yeah i d- i think smoking too the only thing is is that smoking i would 

134.07 134.80 B: right 

136.70 140.81 B: since they go hand in hand also like alcohol and smoking 

138.52 139.46 A: yeah 

139.85 144.52 A: yeah it c- it would hurt your health but it's not illegal 

144.70 146.50 A: to smoke excessively 

147.01 149.46 A: like it's not illegal to smoke and drive 

150.42 151.39 B: that's true 

150.47 157.56 A: but it is illegal to drink and drive so as far as the legal aspect is concerned i would still have to go with 

153.18 154.00 B: uh-huh 

157.85 161.06 A: alcohol but smoking would probably be 

161.32 162.87 A: my second choice 

162.93 163.76 B: okay 

163.69 165.38 A: in in that list 

164.99 165.84 B: uh-huh 

166.07 168.85 B: yeah i'm glad that in new york like they have 

166.35 167.22 A: pers- 

169.34 170.34 B: uh 

170.88 175.64 B: like banned smoking in uh like bars and clubs and stuff you know 

174.96 180.61 A: sure sure i know i live in texas and uh that's slowly but surely coming around and um 

180.61 191.33 A: i'm allergic to smoke so i personally think the death penalty should be reserved for people who smoke in my face [laughter] but i realise it is it's still a legal product 

191.38 192.27 B: uh-huh 

191.70 196.14 A: in the united states and it's a personal choice and it doesn't impact me at all 

196.41 198.88 A: if someone sh- to smoke in their own home 

196.52 197.32 B: uh-huh 

198.97 202.59 A: now if you wanna extrapolate on that yes it 

202.73 208.40 A: puts your health at an increased risk which raises health insurance costs for everyone 

208.69 210.93 B: right right 

211.09 211.83 B: (( yeah )) 

211.15 212.00 A: but i 

212.25 218.07 A: but then so would you could make the argument that so would uh not exercising or overeating you know 

213.84 215.87 B: (( not in not to mhm )) 

219.61 220.71 A: but i i 

219.64 223.35 B: but uh overeating uh doesn't affect 

224.02 225.81 B: other people does it or 

226.46 227.33 A: no 

227.73 230.92 B: so it's it's a personal thing right yeah 

227.79 229.30 A: i don't think it does 

230.24 234.64 A: it's a personal thing except once again you could say it im- it puts your 

235.07 242.47 A: health at increased risk and that would possibly further down the line increase everyone's health cost 

242.37 243.21 B: uh-huh 

243.40 251.52 A: you know whether you're on an h._m._o. or you have personal insurance or whether you just walk up to the doctor's office and pay that increases everyone's health cost 

252.40 253.66 B: oh okay true 

253.71 260.20 A: but then so does so does you know any kind of risk taking behavior people who play sports have a higher risk of injury 

253.76 254.56 B: yeah 

260.09 260.91 B: uh-huh 

260.96 262.14 A: (( you know so )) 

261.92 263.63 B: yep 

263.79 265.53 A: but i still think that's pretty 

265.66 268.81 A: far down there on the list um 

267.70 268.71 B: (( right right )) 

269.27 271.20 B: (( what what were the other two items )) 

271.08 272.92 A: uh gossiping 

273.40 274.71 A: which i think on a 

273.52 276.50 B: that's pretty harmless i would say i mean maybe 

275.87 277.61 A: (( no it can be pretty malici- )) 

276.52 278.98 B: maybe if you do it on an excessive it 

278.57 281.66 A: yeah i- i- it can be pretty malicious 

280.11 283.27 B: might be emotionally emotionally hurtful for 

281.72 282.60 A: yeah 

283.71 284.59 A: yeah 

283.86 285.56 B: (( right yeah mhm )) 

284.68 286.10 A: but i don't think that 

286.17 291.47 A: it really goes so far as to affect your health and it's certainly not illegal and you can 

291.54 293.54 A: gossip and drive yeah 

291.69 294.97 B: it's rude but uh that's about it as far as it goes 

294.87 296.85 A: yeah that would probably be 

296.99 300.62 A: well like i thought i think it's unpleasant and unflattering and 

300.20 301.07 B: uh-huh 

300.77 304.22 A: i certainly try to teach my children not to do it 

303.84 305.55 B: (( right right )) 

304.95 308.66 A: i think as far as its impact it's probably 

308.67 313.16 A: the least amount on that list of things they gave us to talk about 

313.17 314.41 B: yeah and uh 

315.14 321.37 B: all of these things are harmless if done at a moderate level i would say right 

320.73 322.91 A: yes definitely definitely 

322.29 323.98 B: yeah 

323.54 329.35 A: maybe well i don't know if you can say smoking is harmless at a moderate level or not i don't know 

330.24 332.28 A: i don't have enough information on that 

330.26 335.85 B: like if you don't buy your own pack and you just bum off someone like at a social gathering that's my thoughts uh-huh 

335.93 340.45 A: probably but i'm not a smoker so i didn't i've never known anyone that was 

341.05 344.25 A: that was just you know would just smoke on an intermittent 

344.43 345.60 A: basis 

345.31 346.81 B: right right 

346.37 349.12 A: but the only smokers i've ever known are the you know 

349.28 351.40 A: four or five pack a day types [laughter] 

351.26 352.12 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

351.90 353.67 A: that just smoke smoke smoke 

353.90 359.35 A: but i guess you're right yeah uh but certainly i don't think there's anything wrong with 

359.86 365.95 A: moderate use of alcohol in fact there's lots of studies out that say moderate use of alcohol is actually good for you 

365.88 367.51 B: exactly like these 

368.30 371.24 B: people who lived a long life they say they drink 

368.35 369.14 A: yeah 

372.17 374.83 B: they c- wine to their 

372.97 383.36 A: yeah well there's there's certainly a lot of french people running around and they certainly drink a lot so [laughter] and i don't see the french dying out any time soon so that seems 

376.18 377.10 B: (( i know )) 

379.51 380.32 B: uh 

383.65 384.55 A: yeah 

384.30 385.25 B: (( yeah so )) 

385.23 388.33 A: so i kinda think we're we're pretty much in agreement 

388.52 392.30 A: let's see i guess the other one was not exercising 

391.79 393.61 B: mhm not exercise 

393.89 395.59 A: yeah i i think that 

394.46 398.39 B: well if you have a high metabolism then i guess it's not needed or 

398.63 405.29 A: [sigh] yeah once again i think it's just sort of a personal thing and it's sort of like the overeating thing it would only impact 

398.90 399.79 B: (( or )) 

405.72 409.79 A: other people in so far as it might increase your uh 

411.39 413.40 A: your health risk and 

413.72 415.13 B: (( mhm right )) 

414.40 419.61 A: then further maybe tend to increase overall the cost of 

419.80 424.74 A: medical care in the country but that's pretty you'd have you'd have to extrapolate that pretty far out 

419.94 420.72 B: (( mhm )) 

424.80 425.63 B: uh-huh 

425.57 430.63 A: and not and not even sure that there's ever been any studies done to say 

430.95 433.73 A: because one person who doesn't exercise might be 

433.78 436.85 A: a whole lot healthier than other person who does exercise 

436.00 439.09 B: at least look a whole lot healthier even though 

437.83 439.33 A: (( yeah yeah well )) 

439.50 443.39 B: there might be other adverse affects right 

439.54 440.62 A: (( i was gonna s- )) 

442.77 445.64 A: yeah 'cause so much depends on your genes 

446.33 450.91 A: what you came with like i have really low blood pressure but it's not because 

450.82 451.76 B: genetic 

450.92 455.41 A: i do anything to make sure i have really low blood pressure i was just born that way 

455.28 456.56 B: (( i see )) 

456.92 458.01 A: and uh 

457.11 457.93 B: okay 

458.19 466.03 A: and i know a lot of people that do everything right that have you know high blood pressure and have to really work at not having high blood pressure 

466.13 469.96 A: but just that's just how we were born all wired up 

469.68 470.51 B: uh-huh 

472.53 473.28 A: so 

473.32 474.06 A: but 

474.29 477.68 A: other than that i think we're pretty much in agreement that alcohol was 

477.43 479.59 B: alcohol is yeah uh 

479.10 480.84 A: alcohol in excess 

481.84 483.54 A: was probably the worst 

482.03 484.29 B: the greatest contributor yeah and 

483.66 484.60 A: yeah 

485.66 486.83 A: 'cause that can 

487.00 489.58 B: uh and and i would say like 

490.51 491.67 B: if you 

492.98 496.29 B: should we discuss like mixture of several 

496.95 499.43 B: of these five things or 

499.82 500.65 A: true 

500.66 501.60 A: (( it's true )) 

502.02 505.99 B: uh so alcohol and smoking would be the worst i guess right 

505.72 506.86 A: prob- yeah 

506.15 507.70 B: and the most readily 

508.20 509.94 B: uh conducive 

508.50 509.35 A: yeah 

511.12 521.14 A: probab- yeah probably on your health would probabl- alcohol and smoking would probably impact your health but it might also impact your finances because alcohol and cigarettes aren't cheap 

520.95 524.50 B: exactly yeah especially cigarettes nowadays mhm 

524.76 526.89 A: at all not cheap at all 

527.67 528.46 A: so 

528.86 533.07 A: your that's one thing we hadn't talked about is how all these things affect your finances 

532.96 533.94 B: (( right right yeah )) 

534.79 537.63 A: (( at all that was my daughter tells me )) 

536.03 539.79 B: but and it might like people who are addicted to them 

539.85 544.73 B: are induced to steal from their close l- their close ones you know 

540.03 540.75 A: (( do you )) 

544.70 547.56 A: (( can you just see to the outside pressure of the unit inside [noise] )) 

547.71 552.37 A: you're checking our three air conditioning units one doesn't work uh-huh one of them doesn't work uh-huh 

552.47 554.50 A: okay i'm sorry [laughter] 

553.61 554.43 B: uh-huh 

555.04 560.99 B: uh yeah so like you might be induced to steal form your loved ones that might have detrimental effect 

555.24 555.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

559.63 560.44 A: yes 

561.00 562.98 A: i think that's true also 

562.15 564.20 B: on society [laughter] 

563.57 564.46 A: yes 

566.06 567.12 B: (( and uh )) 

568.21 570.91 A: (( this is the one that doesn't work i have it off right now )) 

571.72 575.38 A: the fan blows but it doesn't get cold all right i'm sorry [laughter] 

575.03 575.85 B: okay 

575.88 579.50 A: i have a service person here one of our air conditioning units isn't working 

579.62 581.24 B: someone's at home to look at it 

579.66 580.29 A: so 

581.15 582.00 A: (( yes yeah )) 

582.45 584.05 A: they're here now everything's fine 

584.12 585.51 A: so [sigh] 

586.75 589.70 A: i guess that was i can't think of any other aspect 

591.33 592.19 B: yeah 

591.60 594.52 A: other than that financial that we hadn't discussed or 

595.45 597.16 A: talked about 

597.14 599.89 B: [noise] and of course in of course in smoking there is the 

597.22 598.73 A: i'm not sure
