4.33 5.75 A: (( hi deanna )) 

5.33 6.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

6.87 8.57 B: is this your first phone call 

8.29 9.81 A: (( yes it is )) 

9.29 13.50 B: okay um i'm quite surprised to get the call cause i just signed up yesterday 

13.63 16.82 B: so let's see um our topics were 

18.51 19.88 B: personal habits 

19.54 20.80 A: (( personal habits )) 

20.71 22.55 B: but then it said uh 

22.57 24.37 B: what do we think is worse 

24.25 25.45 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

24.83 27.19 B: and the choices were over eating 

27.41 28.25 B: (( hm )) 

28.04 30.64 A: (( [noise] i )) 

30.47 31.54 B: what did you say 

31.43 33.15 A: said that could be one 

32.53 36.43 B: that could be one but you know i've gotta think of alcohol 

36.38 37.50 A: alcohol 

37.00 40.15 B: how it could potentially impact so many more around you 

39.97 40.87 A: yep 

40.82 42.27 B: and uh 

43.91 48.86 B: i am a big coffee drinker so i guess i'm guilty of the caffeinated stuff 

48.26 53.08 A: yeah coffee drinking that that'd that could be is caffeine d- 

53.00 57.72 B: yeah i would have to say that personally i would eliminate the coffee 

58.11 63.19 B: i see that as the least detrimental and so that leaves me with what um 

62.77 64.28 A: reading and uh 

64.30 66.27 A: was it reading uh the other one 

66.61 68.98 B: oh was one of them i couldn't hear one of them 

68.59 69.92 A: (( one of them was reading )) 

69.64 70.77 B: reading 

70.49 72.01 A: (( reading yeah )) 

71.10 71.87 B: oh 

71.99 72.75 B: i 

72.94 73.90 A: reading 

74.39 76.11 B: would have to say uh 

76.23 77.06 B: (( no )) 

77.02 78.07 A: (( um )) 

77.93 82.21 B: so we're looking at what for me personally what about you have you eliminated any 

82.05 84.63 A: yeah i eliminated the um 

84.73 88.81 A: alcohol the alcohol and the uh over eating 

89.01 90.87 A: that's what i i come up with 

91.74 93.37 B: as what as uh 

93.57 95.11 B: the the worst 

94.65 95.51 A: worst 

96.18 97.85 B: alcohol and over eating 

96.54 98.61 A: yep 

98.76 105.35 B: yeah yeah do you have any history of alcoholism in you family or anything like that 

104.58 106.71 A: i'm a recovering alcoholic 

106.10 110.85 B: are you oh well then you definitely know the impacts and yeah 

108.81 109.92 A: (( yep )) 

111.03 112.17 A: right now 

112.36 113.46 B: pardon me 

113.06 116.04 A: i got seventeen years sobriety right now 

115.50 123.65 B: oh for god bless you that is amazing that's amazing because you know what all of the external stuff doesn't go away so it's a constant 

122.92 123.93 A: oh it doesn't 

124.61 127.29 B: do you find that it's gotten easier for you 

127.04 128.38 A: oh yeah 

127.83 128.92 B: (( it has )) 

128.44 133.80 A: (( yeah but you feel better one day at a time )) 

133.39 134.58 B: right 

134.67 138.27 A: cause i'll tell you it just takes one time and you can pick it off 

137.88 144.18 B: well you know it's funny cause i guess the way we're programs plus for alcoholism they say so much of it is genetic 

144.34 149.93 B: and if you uh have already had it i guess in your system i imagine you'd be even more so for that but 

150.53 154.15 B: i wish you all of the best on you continued success i know that's uh 

154.31 155.96 B: has got to be challenging 

155.67 157.18 A: it's a disease 

157.28 162.53 B: yeah that's what i understand from what little i know about it but um 

161.59 163.97 A: (( i think um )) 

164.35 166.20 A: pictures and everything else 

166.78 168.60 A: somebody's inside your 

170.85 172.89 B: oh for um yeah well 

172.44 173.48 A: (( liver )) 

173.19 175.97 B: you mean right you mean physically as well 

175.32 177.32 A: (( yeah eats you right up )) 

176.75 180.20 B: mhm which brings up another good point why that's uh 

180.31 181.98 B: i guess in our opinion 

182.00 183.61 B: the most detrimental 

183.65 189.50 B: because aside from what it can do to you emotionally and spiritually and physically 

188.91 190.66 A: (( yep that's it )) 

190.16 194.09 B: socially it seems to have the most cons against it yeah 

197.04 198.03 B: excuse me 

197.84 200.60 A: and it can put you in a denial state 

200.08 201.88 B: yeah yeah 

202.06 204.17 A: you think of it as you know 

204.27 206.80 A: what the heck it's not gonna bother me you know 

206.17 211.36 B: well you know and not just alcoholism i think that's probably true of addiction in in general 

211.62 213.42 A: yeah that's an addiction 

213.02 214.39 B: yeah 

214.97 219.06 A: drugs are the same way they how about drugs 

218.78 220.47 B: yeah 

220.53 230.37 B: and it's funny because um with the drugs i mean it doesn't have to be the ser- well i guess what some people would consider the serious drugs you know [laughter] it could happen from just um 

229.80 231.25 A: the way they should of 

231.51 233.28 A: drugs and alcohol 

232.67 233.82 B: mhm 

234.63 235.86 B: yeah 

235.12 241.49 A: [mn] you can drink alcohol and take a take an aspirin you can get you're gonna get a kick out of it sometimes 

241.22 242.29 B: oh really 

242.03 243.51 A: oh yeah sometimes if 

243.97 248.57 A: you've got medicine alcohol what you can get a kick off it 

246.06 246.80 B: huh 

249.87 251.33 A: oh yeah you get 

251.45 254.94 A: (( that's why they tell you not to drink alcohol when you take your medicine )) 

254.57 266.40 B: oh well i guess that's especially with something like an aspirin or something as well yeah i mean aside from it chemicals and everything but i would think like something as simple as an aspirin but they say what that it thins out your blood so i imagine the effects are much higher 

265.92 267.18 A: (( yep )) 

266.90 270.94 B: yeah see all of the things that you learn on these phone calls 

269.92 272.86 A: (( yeah )) 

271.88 274.17 B: [laughter] so this is your first phone call 

273.92 275.33 A: (( [laughter] yes it is )) 

274.70 276.53 B: and when did you sign up 

276.85 280.07 A: my wife signed up actually my wife oh 

280.26 281.26 A: (( and )) 

280.53 283.05 B: oh and the phone rang and she handed it to you [laughter] 

282.33 285.96 A: i no she's not here she's working right now 

285.67 286.67 B: (( mm )) 

286.13 290.25 A: (( but the phone rang and i started answering the [laughter] )) 

289.27 291.28 B: well at least you knew what it was about 

291.44 293.32 B: i just signed up last 

291.71 294.82 A: (( i don't know much about it she told me about it )) 

295.01 299.88 A: earlier and um somebody calls you know just do the survey for me 

299.49 311.45 B: how funny because it i mean it's true they didn't give you much information i they didn't give me you know it's and i even checked up on it a little bit i realised it's supposed to have a link or it's a study with the university of pennsylvania 

311.01 312.35 A: (( yep )) 

312.05 325.48 B: and uh i think a lot of it has to do with um speech and such but aside from that and it's a good reminder because i haven't mentioned it to my husband yet so [laughter] i'm going to be stepping out this evening so i better prepare him 

325.02 328.16 A: yep most of its just plain common 

325.61 327.01 B: mhm 

328.73 330.06 B: yeah 

329.51 332.10 A: sense most of it you know you just 

332.04 332.91 B: talk 

332.45 336.61 A: whatever your topic is you've just gotta what they're topic is 

337.68 342.83 A: what the topic gonna be and go from there and you know whatever they're gonna have 

342.55 346.52 B: you know but for me it was a departure from when they said personal habits 

346.44 348.02 A: (( oh yeah )) 

347.25 355.58 B: to to what you know you consider to be i can't even remember what the question was the most detrimental or the most harmful or what do you 

355.17 357.43 A: the most uh worst 

356.86 359.83 B: what the worst thing is in your opinion yeah 

359.20 361.76 A: yeah most worst things in your life 

362.02 363.87 A: opinion in your life 

364.16 366.71 A: (( that was )) 

366.78 367.77 B: yeah 

366.90 373.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

370.12 371.16 B: yeah 

371.60 379.71 B: i'd have to agree you know and i mean i think you really punctuated it by telling me you know your own personal experience with it because it really helps to bring it in 

379.73 384.80 A: you got your over eating over eating you've a lot of over eaters right now 

385.21 386.08 A: (( you know )) 

386.19 390.18 A: the weight classes and everything else weight watchers and all of that stuff you

389.54 390.66 B: mhm 

390.37 391.21 A: (( know )) 

391.84 394.42 B: and so much of that over eating i'm sure is um 

395.12 397.21 B: a result of certain pains 

397.47 399.50 B: and certain uh certain emotional 

399.86 402.85 B: baggage that you have or problems that you've had
