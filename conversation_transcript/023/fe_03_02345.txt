160.49 161.64 A: [laughter] 

162.30 164.76 A: i think gossiping is could be dangerous though 'cause 

164.25 171.33 B: oh yeah definitely definitely definitely i have a few friends that gossip heavily and it's not good 

170.82 173.93 A: it it's hard not to but when you know somebody but yeah 

171.61 175.87 B: well it always gets back to them but they're the only person that you've said something to 

176.19 181.44 B: please don't tell anyone i'm telling you this you know what i'm saying and the next thing you know the whole neighborhood knows

191.35 201.71 B: so it could only be them that said that and they vehemently deny it no i didn't say anything swear to god i didn't say anything well it had to have been you 'cause no one else knows 

201.89 204.99 A: well it's just easier to tell the truth or not tell somebody something

428.55 430.87 B: well they say people places and things 

430.33 431.65 A: but it's true though 

431.27 432.53 B: is it 

431.91 442.17 A: it it helps just to get out of the neighborhood and then you know 'cause if you want that stuff you're gonna find it wherever you go but but if you wanna get off it it helps not to be around it 'til you get strong 

437.07 438.46 B: this is true 

442.19 443.00 B: hm 

442.67 446.76 A: until life starts to get better then it's like well hey this really isn't so bad

529.64 531.06 B: (( yeah i guess )) 

530.69 543.02 A: and it's you know what it boils down to 'cause i don't think most i don't think most [noise] people do it because it to cover this or cover that or hide the way they feel that's baloney they do it 'cause they wanna do it period [laughter] that's what i did anyways
