0.50 2.42 B: hi my name is beth 

1.74 3.80 A: hi my name is bill 

4.47 5.95 A: how are you tonight 

5.55 9.09 B: okay oh we just start now huh [laughter] this is the first time i've done this 

7.24 10.42 A: i guess yeah yeah same with me 

9.78 10.77 B: okay 

10.74 23.04 A: uh the topic about uh health um i guess what i'm not a believer in going to the doctor immediately when i feel uh poorly usually it has to get pretty serious for me to uh 

23.61 25.69 A: to go to a physician 

25.82 31.57 B: um i agree i don't know unless absolutely necessary i'm not a doctor or medicine person 

31.95 38.24 A: right uh well the one of the major problems is the fact that it's extremely difficult now to uh 

38.55 43.78 A: you know to get an appointment when you can uh you can be there and i live in 

43.90 47.16 A: near a very populated area of the country that uh 

47.68 56.20 A: has huge practices family practices and when you try to get an appointment uh unless it's a dire emergency it sometimes takes as long as a week 

56.01 58.39 B: right and by then you're not sick any more 

58.37 59.06 A: no 

59.02 59.68 B: [laughter] 

60.50 71.64 A: well i don't know what your exp- i don't know whether you have you've uh have kids i mean i have children and um you know they're continually especially in the winter months continually coming down with 

72.45 84.49 A: with um some sort of cold or uh twenty four hour bug and you know if you'd spent that if you took one to the doctor every time they got a little ill you'd be there forever 

82.00 83.18 B: right 

84.39 92.78 B: yeah my kids are teenagers and they don't go to the doctor that i mean they've had their check ups of course and everything but we've i don't usually take them to the doctor unless it's 

93.16 94.63 B: pretty extreme 

94.89 96.16 B: or they're 

96.42 99.35 B: sick for more than a while or extremely high fever 

100.31 107.03 A: well one of the things i find is that if the kids are active and they uh participate in sports and uh they're active 

108.57 112.34 A: you know they they don't seem to get as sick as as kids who 

112.42 119.15 A: uh who don't participate it believe it or not you'd think they'd be exposed to more situations where they catch uh 

119.73 126.59 A: colds being in activities but i guess there's some benefits in sports to uh to building up their immune systems 

125.98 135.25 B: right they stay healthier my yeah my my kids are boys and they're both in sport all the time and they are pretty healthy for the most part mm they 

135.68 137.58 B: haven't really had that many 

137.63 141.66 B: colds or flu in a long time and they're older now so i guess 

142.19 145.58 B: they're not in a like a daycare environment which probably helps them 

146.54 153.00 A: yeah that's true um you know especially the younger ones in daycare uh it does have an impact just the number of 

154.12 158.98 A: number of kids and the length of time some of these kids spend in daycare 

156.56 157.41 B: right 

158.24 161.64 B: and they're all touching the same things and sharing them 

160.11 161.17 A: right 

162.18 165.21 A: i guess there's there is something to be said for uh 

166.22 167.25 A: (( uh )) 

167.79 171.39 A: for uh raising your kids at home [laughter] 

170.00 171.96 B: right if you have that option 

171.80 174.12 A: right and not too many people do now 

172.50 173.18 B: (( [laughter] )) 

174.03 175.11 B: right 

175.03 178.78 A: uh but i've i've always in terms of 

179.63 181.99 A: uh in terms of trying to to 

182.63 185.97 A: uh stay healthy or you know i 

186.48 195.65 A: i guess for the last two years i've taken a flu shot which is the first time i have even i've been offered them for twenty years and i've never really taken it 

194.15 195.07 B: mhm 

196.27 202.26 A: and i didn't really one thing i noticed was i didn't get sick this this past uh 

200.76 201.45 B: (( mm )) 

202.68 204.70 A: cold and flu season so 

204.90 206.71 A: (( i don't know whether that contributed )) 

204.92 211.32 B: yeah i've never had a flu shot but i don't really get sick either i don't i rarely get sick 

211.41 214.42 A: are you in an office environment where you're around a lot of people 

213.02 219.80 B: yeah i am and everybody can be sick around me and i don't usually get sick and i think i i don't know why [laughter] 

219.40 227.90 A: mm it's just a question of immune systems you know that our immune system that are are less susceptible you are to uh catching colds and 

221.69 223.06 B: i guess 

227.64 232.46 B: right and i'm actually working in a medical environment which you would think i would be exposed to more 

232.40 233.29 A: right 

232.53 233.53 B: but 

233.68 239.63 B: for some reason it's just not happening to me which i'm glad [laughter] just hope it doesn't all catch up with me later 

239.22 245.98 A: right yeah well you expect that's true i guess on the other the other side of that is hospitals are probably 

247.18 250.01 A: as clean or more clean than uh 

250.22 256.82 A: than the average home because of just that reason they don't want to they don't want people going in there and staying there and getting ill from 

257.40 260.82 A: from other uh other diseases so 

257.60 258.46 B: right 

261.15 262.13 A: um 

262.90 266.40 A: the problem uh the problem that i find is that uh 

266.49 270.57 A: it seems as you said it seems like the younger kids are more susceptible to it 

270.36 277.18 B: right i think just because they touch so many things and touch their face their mouth 

277.57 283.65 A: oh that you know and hygiene it's difficult to uh [laughter] basic hygiene is difficult to control with 

283.64 293.49 A: smaller kids uh you know they're consistently washing their hands or consistently uh clean things before they they touch them 

284.57 285.59 B: right 

287.11 288.07 B: right 

292.59 293.76 B: right 

293.86 299.54 B: yeah it's hard to make them wash their hands before they eat every time especially because they do a lot of it away from you [laughter] 

299.05 300.99 A: right and 

299.74 301.37 B: they're with other friends 

301.25 304.84 A: plus it seems that uh their energy requirements are their 

305.40 311.19 A: food requirements are such that they need to be um eating a lot more frequently than adults do 

310.88 312.77 B: mhm 

311.55 313.56 A: and i guess it's much more uh 

314.31 321.58 A: uh it's much more of uh important thing to them to eat when they're hungry than it is for us we'll just ignore it and continue 

321.73 323.50 B: exactly 

321.74 323.80 A: doing whatever we're doing 

323.53 328.74 B: well we don't always have that convenience of eating when we're hungry [laughter] depending on if we're working or 

326.50 327.43 A: (( yeah )) 

329.71 333.85 A: well you know the other we've uh i guess as 

334.02 338.27 A: as we progress with technology we we've we've also become 

339.16 351.74 A: uh more used to going to the doctor and for example you know my parents rarely went to the doctor i mean they had to be i mean normally a doctor's visit would only 

351.75 355.11 A: come after some catastrophic uh 

355.66 363.14 A: occurrence or a trip to the emergency room or something there'd be a follow up by the doctor but or a once a year visit for a check up 

356.45 357.96 B: right 

363.59 364.86 A: (( but as )) 

364.88 373.31 A: things progressed and uh i guess we were we just got more and more used to going to uh get treatment 

371.79 376.96 B: right there's so much more preventative medicine or diagnostic ability 

374.27 375.13 A: right 

377.86 381.74 B: that everybody's going for the diagnostic tests now i think 

382.46 389.61 A: well which makes sense um you know at least you can deal with it if you know it's coming when it happens it's a little too late 

387.61 392.02 B: right exactly which i think yeah that happened with 

392.36 396.43 B: my grandparents and other people older than that 

397.14 408.27 A: uh do you think that uh um the diagnostics tests that they run really have a different type of uh it's like an m._r._i. now they're advertising that they say can predict uh 

409.09 415.95 A: predict uh the possibility of heart disease and and do you think those things are accurate 

412.70 414.07 B: mhm 

415.98 425.98 B: um fair- i actually work for a radiology group so yeah pretty much [laughter] um they i mean they can tell what your susceptibility because of the 

418.63 419.83 A: oh okay 

426.13 429.09 B: they can see the narrowing of the arteries 

428.76 429.78 A: mhm 

429.17 433.19 B: and if you're getting close to closing off an artery then 

433.33 435.30 B: you're probably gonna have a problem 

436.15 442.11 A: yeah how good are they i mean at actually you know like an xray you don't you don't get much of a picture of 

441.64 444.77 B: right you can't really see that narrowing um 

444.91 446.24 A: uh where the 

445.67 459.82 B: the and now on the newer machines you can get you know they used to do the um angios where you had to have the dye injected and everything it was a major surgical proce- well not a major surgical procedure but it was a big ordeal 

452.08 452.99 A: right 

459.65 462.03 B: i wouldn't want to do it 

459.88 464.31 A: yeah anybody doing anything around my arteries is a major [laughter] 

462.60 468.68 B: right yeah i would rather just lay in a tube and let it take a picture [laughter] if i had a choice 

465.67 466.66 A: (( yeah )) 

468.83 469.89 A: no 

468.84 471.89 B: they offer to have the p._a._t. imaging now with the um 

472.31 473.64 B: for cancer 

473.48 474.41 A: mhm 

473.79 478.40 B: which is really amazing if you've ever seen it or 

479.21 490.53 B: it is very interesting technology it's a three dimensional picture they inject you with a sug- a a radioactive isotope that has a sugar solution and tumors metabolize sugar at a different rate 

487.65 488.24 A: (( mm )) 

490.38 491.46 A: really 

490.92 497.34 B: so when they run you through this machine and do this three d. scan anywhere that has a tumor shows up on the scan 

497.47 498.05 A: (( mm )) 

498.04 504.90 B: they use it for people that have had for a a cancer already or they're in an advanced stage to see where else it's spread to 

505.63 506.86 B: there could be all 

505.89 511.38 A: so but i imagine that would be very uh very helpful for early detection too 

511.56 526.37 B: right they're not really using it too much right now for you know like as a pre diagnostic test because it's fairly new and it's fairly expensive but i know like through the groups we work through they have they even advertise it in the paper you can get a full body scan and 

526.68 527.45 B: you know 

527.87 535.51 B: i've you can pay cash for it out of your pocket if you want that peace of mind you know because your insurance isn't going to pay for it just because you want to have it [laughter] 

530.49 531.38 A: right 

535.42 548.23 A: oh no i've seen that i've seen those ads uh where i live too same thing in the papers that uh basically a disclaimer saying you know this is the cost and most insurance companies won't pay for it 

539.73 542.04 B: yeah 

547.16 548.08 B: right 

548.39 554.74 A: uh how i mean are those so they're more accurate than what they used to call stress tests where they just basically 

554.78 558.86 A: you know exercise you to the point where i guess right 

556.64 567.54 B: right because that's testing your heart's reaction to the stress where the uh you may have no symptoms with narrowing arteries and until actually you have a heart attack 

568.92 572.37 A: mm so it sounds like they are slowly moving towards 

571.95 573.08 B: right 

572.67 574.68 A: diagnostics so 

573.76 577.83 B: if if you have a history of heart disease you can usually get it covered 

577.84 585.49 B: you know they won't just do it for anybody just because they want one we're just getting to the point where the average consumer is wanting some of these tests 

585.83 592.85 B: as a diagnostic um preventative test but we're not there yet [laughter] they're expensive 

590.69 596.82 A: yeah well i mean it's difficult to say okay we'll pay for yours but we won't pay for yours i mean obviously 

594.36 595.53 B: right 

595.72 596.87 B: right 

596.89 599.89 A: especially if you're paying the same premium for insurance
