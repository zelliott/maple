151.29 160.07 A: i i guess we're supposed to try to talk about the subject for ten minutes or so but yeah i think that's what it's supposed to be and that's the how it is

170.02 181.61 B: so yeah [noise] uh-huh yeah and it's

181.54 187.69 B: i mean it's cool that they offer it to anybody who's willing to talk on the phone i'm always willing to do it you kn- [laughter] 

184.53 186.44 A: mhm right exactly 

186.75 189.04 A: exactly but um 

189.25 190.39 A: um 

189.88 197.51 B: yeah still kinda gets me with the the topic 'cause i'm actually we just finished up with our classes we're heading downtown for happy hour so [laughter] 

195.70 208.49 A: [laughter] okay so is that why you didn't pick alcohol [laughter] well uh i'm in a different phase of life i'm headed i'm headed to a baseball field so i got i got little kids and and 

198.81 201.34 B: yeah yeah i think so [laughter] 

206.28 207.16 B: (( uh-huh so )) 

208.27 218.37 A: again and you look at the kids on the on the fields and you know again that's where over- i'm also i also i have a nutrition business so so ov- over 

208.32 209.58 B: (( you just watch the kids )) 

212.37 213.20 B: uh-huh 

216.83 221.32 B: oh really well then that would explain the overeating [laughter] 

218.69 219.69 A: right 

219.74 227.29 A: i mean like again none of them are are good so uh but it's just again the way that everybody you know 

222.33 224.12 B: yeah 

227.32 233.76 A: the nation as a whole continues to eat and we have larger sizes and supersizing everything 

231.14 232.78 B: yeah 

233.35 235.01 B: everything [laughter] 

234.38 246.92 A: um it just you know you have you know the heart issue the cancer issues and all all the chemicals that are in the foods and stuff like that so you know most people who are overeating aren't overeating vegetables you know so 

245.65 247.73 B: exactly it's more 

247.64 248.85 A: yeah 

247.76 249.51 B: more uh detrimental 

249.22 252.97 A: mhm yeah so it really really doesn't uh 

249.55 251.18 B: yeah 

253.29 254.03 A: (( you know )) 

254.07 258.05 A: n- n- none none of it helps in that regard so um 

256.08 257.18 B: yeah 

258.37 259.79 A: but uh 

260.44 265.74 A: and again we know what alcohol does we know what caffeine does and uh 

264.74 265.85 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

266.04 268.56 A: i forget what they said the other things were so 

267.53 272.71 B: i c- i didn't hear the other things i my phone was breaking up so [laughter] but 

270.17 278.85 A: uh-huh [laughter] so uh but anyway so so where where part of manha- i worked in manhattan for twelve years so yeah 

277.40 282.46 B: oh really yeah i'm i go to school at fordham so um around the 

279.86 280.75 A: uh-huh

286.98 288.31 B: in um 

288.41 289.72 B: belmont so 

289.08 289.97 A: uh-huh 

290.44 291.72 A: that's kinda neat 

290.80 300.44 B: [mn] headed downtown to hang out with some friends and [laughter] you know vices [laughter] 

295.56 296.97 A: right right 

297.99 307.12 A: right right no it sounds good to me i i can remember those days [laughter] good old i i i did plenty drinking in manhattan in my days and uh 

306.18 307.46 B: [laughter] 

307.07 321.48 A: and in it it's so funny when you're when you're like me now i'm i'm forty f- forty four years old and and i'm married and have two two young boys you know and of course as they're getting older you know all those kinds of habits take on a whole different um 

311.82 314.70 B: [laughter] [noise] uh-huh [noise] 

316.22 317.01 B: uh-huh 

321.71 323.98 A: perspective [laughter] 

321.80 322.79 B: yeah 

322.76 328.74 B: also that's a point in my figuring like for me right now it'd be m- like the caffeine isn't [noise] 

328.59 343.26 B: is an issue for some friends who you know are trying to stay up all night if you're trying to finish finals and like that's that's why i was talking about the pills because people you know get crazy and find they need to somehow keep themselves up and also you know alcohol's always an issue any college here so 

332.78 333.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

337.21 338.15 A: mhm 

338.94 339.95 A: right 

341.59 342.65 A: mhm 

342.73 343.69 A: mhm 

344.48 349.22 B: i think depending on your point in life it's different as well i mean if uh overeating goes 

344.53 345.61 A: yeah 

349.27 354.55 B: from throughout your entire lifetime then it obviously becomes a huge problem [mn] [noise] 

352.97 362.31 A: right right yes it definitely can and like i said uh you know i have the opportunity now to [laughter] to you know to see young children and you know sometimes you go 

362.29 370.45 A: go up to school go to a baseball game or something and you're just looking at them and saying oh my g- you know y- you know these poor kids are set up for a lifetime of you know 

369.48 371.14 B: yeah 

370.72 379.11 A: and as as we j- you know i mean my husband can be primarily because of the type of business that we're in and we're more conscientious about you know 

378.22 379.79 B: right yeah 

378.99 390.73 A: it um you know you try not to but i mean it's just so easy you know when when it's hectic in your life to just fall into the trap of like let's just drive through and you know move on our way 

386.20 388.28 B: to go to mcdonalds [laughter] 

389.32 390.25 B: yeah 

390.54 398.48 A: so it's it's really like like right now it's four twelve and i'm making dinner 'cause we have to be out of here by quarter to five and and it's just like 

396.37 398.44 B: (( mhm )) 

398.75 413.59 A: it it took me a while to get into that mode of okay you really do have to eat dinner before you leave because otherwise you know you're always gonna be feeding these kids fast food you know or so it just kind of um you know and that's un- unfortunately yeah my 

406.94 408.21 B: yeah exactly 

411.56 412.80 B: (( and that's tr- )) 

413.70 418.28 A: kid is over here saying i like it when you feed me fast food [laughter] but uh 

416.01 430.51 B: [laughter] and the prices of food like also plays a major impact as well like if you don't if you can't afford to buy organic or if you can't afford to buy a lot of [laughter] like for me we we have our apartment and you know you buy what you [laughter] what you can afford 

429.68 431.80 A: afford right right 

430.63 436.33 B: you know boxes of macaroni and cheese are lot [noise] cheaper than buying salad in a bag or buying you know that kinda stuff 

433.25 434.30 A: mhm 

435.95 437.70 A: right right no 

436.72 439.16 B: so money plays into this so 

438.79 439.78 A: mhm 

439.83 453.71 A: no it does make a huge um right that that that impacts so much too is is is what y- what you can afford 'cause even even as healthy as i eat some- i mean and i'm not saying i'm perfect believe me [sigh] but a friend of mine just said like from the local grocery store she goes 

444.29 445.50 B: yeah 

450.23 452.07 B: [noise] [laughter] 

453.74 465.34 A: she goes i'm only buying organic meat from there and i go you are i go i i can't go there yet [laughter] i can't i can't spend that money yet i said it's just like you know we'll live with those steroids a few more years you know 

458.71 459.78 B: yeah 

464.38 473.15 B: yeah and it's so much i mean in being in the in the bronx it's sort of like you can see there there's a there's a big there's a problem with um obesity well because in 

471.55 472.63 A: mhm 

473.41 482.18 B: a a matter of money as well 'cause people can't afford to you know go go to a good a nice restaurant to have a dinner with the family it ends up being in macdonalds a 

474.64 475.95 A: right right 

479.52 480.58 A: right 

482.34 488.96 A: [noise] definitely a direct [noise] right [noise] direct correlation there betw- between the two so 

482.34 483.14 B: cheaper 

483.67 484.67 B: (( type of )) 

484.78 486.59 B: (( yeah )) 

489.22 490.57 A: but uh 

489.50 492.12 B: mhm 

490.61 494.44 A: anyway so and uh you know and 

494.73 500.22 A: again it's just trying it's very difficult with with all the things that they were mentioning to um 

500.50 505.65 A: you know it's it's everything in moderation is really what what you kinda have to go back to and [noise] 

500.95 504.17 B: [noise] yeah 

504.84 510.92 B: and to find the balance of what you can w- was caffeine and alcohol what you can what you can handle and what you can 

507.46 508.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

508.11 512.24 A: [noise] right right [noise] [noise] mhm mhm 

511.55 515.18 B: you know keeps you in control [laughter] 

513.43 514.78 A: right right 

514.92 520.68 A: p- pick your worst vice you know [laughter] it's really difficult but uh 

516.45 518.29 B: yeah [laughter] 

519.56 521.42 B: mhm 

520.93 529.27 A: anyway so it's i think we have about another minute [noise] or something right on the clock here i'm like trying trying to eyeball it and see [noise] but
