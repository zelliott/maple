23.38 27.34 A: okay which one which one [laughter] which one gets your goat [laughter] 

27.18 28.45 B: um 

29.47 31.72 B: i think probably gossiping because 

31.84 35.30 B: um i'm so used to the other ones 'cause 

35.44 38.78 A: you're used so used to the rest of 'em they don't bother you any more [laughter] 

37.94 47.55 B: [noise] yeah well well not so much overeating but just like um most of the people i know drink and smoke cigarettes so it doesn't me so much any more it's just kind of the environment 

48.12 49.29 B: but um 

48.34 49.16 A: oh 

49.64 56.83 B: i don't know well i guess gossiping is present in the environment too but it's uh i think it's more immediately damaging 

50.48 51.72 A: (( i guess i guess )) 

56.49 62.34 A: i guess if it's not uh real facetious although is gossiping by definition facetious i don't know 

62.46 64.06 B: (( hm i don't know [laughter] )) 

62.66 71.89 A: but i can't stand smoking for nothing not in my house not in my car not while i'm eating [sigh] i hate that and drinking i could live without too but 

64.63 65.50 B: yeah 

71.46 72.25 B: yeah 

73.01 76.37 B: did you have um were you around smoke when you were young 

76.64 78.12 B: is that why it bothers you 

76.87 77.70 A: uh 

77.76 82.78 A: no my parents didn't smoke but all my si- older sisters and brother dr- do for some reason 

81.37 82.24 B: mhm 

82.90 85.46 A: so i'm not sure where they picked it up from 'cause not from my 

85.73 86.76 A: parents 

87.93 88.49 B: [mn] 

87.96 88.75 A: then 

88.83 94.08 A: i don't know my husband drinks too much so i think that's why i don't like that [laughter] [laughter] 

92.34 93.20 B: yeah 

94.57 102.18 A: and because i haven't been allowed to have it for so many years because i've either been pregnant or nursing so maybe i'm just jealous [laughter] 

104.40 105.50 B: (( maybe [laughter] )) 

104.63 106.81 A: but so do you have any kids 

106.75 109.92 B: no no i'm mm young i'm only twenty 

110.02 111.73 A: oh twenty well 

110.86 113.03 B: too young for kids [laughter] 

112.20 115.77 A: yeah it's way too young i didn't have my first 'til i was thirty but [cough] 

115.95 117.49 A: yeah ha- have fun 

117.48 118.91 A: [laughter] 

117.89 118.91 B: [laughter] 

118.75 120.76 A: [laughter] okay so th- 

119.53 121.31 B: yeah i think i think when i 

120.60 134.25 A: so this is why you're not dissing the drinking and the smoking yeah 'cause out there having fun drinking and smoking [laughter] [laughter] okay all right now i'm jealous see i'm thirty eight with four kids my drinking and smoking days are over [laughter] 

123.45 124.53 B: yeah 

124.82 126.14 B: [laughter] 

132.22 132.99 B: (( mm )) 

133.41 135.39 B: i think my um 

135.63 149.47 B: whenever i have to explain it to somebody my attitude is always i'm kind of getting this out of the way why while i can get away with it 'cause i know once i get older once once i wanna have kids or whatever i'm going not gonna be able to get away with this any more 

142.71 144.04 A: oh yeah definitely 

144.12 145.44 A: [laughter] 

146.45 148.25 A: yeah 'cause it it's not 

148.72 152.42 A: and still acting like that [laughter] yeah you get away with 

151.57 152.26 B: (( so )) 

152.66 154.31 A: (( ev- yeah [laughter] )) 

155.72 159.67 B: so it's it's it's also probably the social environment that makes um 

160.14 162.36 B: that makes gossiping bother me more 

163.30 164.16 B: (( um )) 

163.97 165.42 A: oh yeah i think i get 

164.53 166.15 B: because because it's in a 

165.47 171.87 A: i think i get ninety percent of my information about what's going on in the community by gossiping [laughter] so i have to 

169.89 170.85 B: yeah 

172.02 175.49 A: my good list not my bad list [laughter] [laughter] 

173.85 174.70 B: yeah 

175.74 180.35 A: that's part of my mommy network [laughter] you know that's how i know what's going on [sigh] 

178.43 179.13 B: (( mm )) 

180.65 181.54 A: (( um )) 

183.23 193.81 B: yeah people people still get their like reputations ruined and and lies get spread about people that that are undeserving of having lies spread about them and 

191.24 197.24 A: [noise] [noise] that's some pretty serious gossiping you know are you talking about gossiping or are you talking about spreading rumors hm 

197.13 200.46 B: um i kind of tie the two together 

198.27 199.09 A: see 

201.24 205.82 A: i gossiping to me is just kinda retelling stories that have already been told 

205.08 205.93 B: okay 

205.93 207.42 A: you know just kind of pass- 

207.84 208.53 A: just 

209.36 210.47 A: as it were 

210.06 211.14 B: yeah 

210.58 212.71 A: you know whether you should actually be 

213.17 218.93 A: you know authorized to do so or not but i think rumors is just making stuff up to hurt people or whatever 

215.21 216.02 B: mhm 

217.71 219.78 B: yeah well i think it's it's 

220.14 221.24 B: um 

221.50 230.96 B: like the [sigh] when when you tell somebody you always exaggerate points and and it's like the game telephone or or or something like that where you um [mn] 

231.16 239.25 B: whatever you say gets distorted um by how many people you tell it to how many sources it has to go through 'cause they always change it a little bit 

239.11 240.58 A: [noise] yeah that's true 

239.26 240.04 B: (( so )) 

240.26 243.44 B: i mean it's not like everybody is lying on purpose but 

243.53 244.62 A: (( yeah it )) 

244.04 244.75 B: (( um )) 

245.20 246.11 B: there's 

245.46 247.25 A: does get diluted and stuff 

246.86 260.43 B: things things have come back to me that like somebody has told me something about something that i did without knowing that it was me who did it and it's completely backwards and they don't they don't realize even that they're talking to the person that they're talking about and it's 

253.54 254.38 A: [laughter] 

260.28 262.98 B: kind of a funny situation [sigh] and 

262.98 266.98 A: [mn] yeah it's like that that game that you play as kids and you get all in a circle and you whisper something [mn] 

267.01 272.29 A: one person's ear and round yeah and when it comes back to that first person it's nothing like it was started 

267.04 268.00 B: (( yeah )) 

272.01 272.81 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

272.54 273.85 A: (( [laughter] yeah ))

350.09 350.96 B: yeah 

354.93 359.26 B: (( [noise] do you remember what the last topic was i can remember four but i couldn't remember the fifth one ))

370.51 371.40 B: but 

370.78 375.56 A: i don't know is it required we stick to topic or they just give us a topic so we'll have something to talk about for ten minutes 

375.32 376.28 B: (( i don't know )) 

376.83 384.39 A: i think i think they probably just give us a topic so people like you and i who probably have [laughter] absolutely nothing in common [laughter] can try to 

382.50 383.45 B: yeah 

384.56 387.66 A: talk for ten minutes without going uh okay uh 

387.81 392.22 B: [laughter] i just normally run out of anything to say [laughter] um i 

388.00 388.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

389.95 391.55 A: [laughter] 

394.07 396.82 B: actually don't think i have anything to say about overeating though 

397.30 397.86 A: (( [mn] )) 

397.72 398.55 B: so 

398.04 406.08 A: well i [laughter] i've had four kids and i haven't lost the the pregnancy weight so don't even get me started there [laughter] i was a size six [laughter] 

405.63 407.88 B: [laughter] well you were pregnant though right 

407.64 416.69 A: yeah it's hard to lose pregnancy weight that's another reason i although that's a bad reason for waiting 'til your later years that way 'cause of course the older you get then the harder it is to get rid of it but 

415.98 417.42 B: mhm 

416.88 419.44 A: i've had my fourth and last child so now i'm 

419.68 425.48 A: soon as i finish nursing then i'm going full full steam ahead and doing the jenny craig or something so 

425.58 429.06 A: i may not get size six back when i was twenty five but you 

429.47 433.72 A: know something reasonably close to that should be fine
