15.49 17.15 B: there's loud noises so 

16.79 20.23 A: oh that's fine i can hear you all right can you hear me okay 

19.94 25.62 B: yeah totally um okay so it's personal hygiene was this the topic 

21.09 22.05 A: great 

25.51 30.13 A: i think that they said the topic was personal habits and they were talking about 

29.05 34.93 B: oh personal habits right and what what what you detest or something 

35.21 40.21 A: um it listed a few things to talk about like gossiping smoking 

39.30 41.08 B: right [laughter] 

40.26 43.38 A: drinking all that good stuff [laughter] 

42.17 44.59 B: okay um let's see 

45.29 47.66 B: (( what do you want to talk about first [laughter] )) 

46.97 49.69 A: um how about 

49.88 51.87 A: exercising that was one of them 

51.95 55.52 B: okay but what was it what do you not like in a person or 

56.09 59.98 A: well it says like what what's the worst of all these 

59.52 61.15 B: oh what's the worst of all these 

60.08 66.11 A: i don't really think i don't really think one is worse than the other in a way it's just kind of 

65.31 67.23 B: right right 

66.17 69.47 A: it depends on how it affects your situation 

69.36 72.43 B: right such as exercising um 

72.50 73.54 B: i mean 

73.79 74.93 B: if you're 

75.09 83.84 B: i guess they're all kind of relating to one another if you're not taking care of yourself you're going to be you know over drinking over smoking over weight you're not 

84.17 85.96 B: taking care of yourself you know 

85.92 87.32 A: right right 

86.32 89.57 B: so i saw exercising i don't think it's a 

89.72 92.98 B: big problem unless 

93.16 94.96 B: you're not healthy [laughter] i guess 

95.25 96.77 A: right unless 

96.80 110.47 A: it it it's supposed to be more so whether you feel healthy and whether you're unhealthy not so much how you weigh that's what they say at least [laughter] so it goes under over eating too you don't want to 

103.65 105.16 B: yeah exactly 

106.00 107.32 B: [laughter] 

110.66 112.65 A: eat so much that 

112.59 116.08 B: you're not healthy and get maintain 

113.60 115.22 A: you're not healthy 

116.48 117.54 B: right 

117.36 122.19 A: y- you have to eat good stuff too you have to have all the nutrients and 

121.59 127.74 B: right well i think i think all of these things are kind of those things that you know you gotta do in moderation 

127.67 129.61 A: mhm 

127.93 133.39 B: such as if you exercise too much then you know that's not good for you either 

133.21 134.53 A: right 

134.21 135.89 B: so um 

136.72 142.95 B: so i kind of like missed i couldn't hear her when she said it so i kind of like missed the general like idea of it 

140.06 141.08 A: oh 

142.07 144.74 A: yeah i don't think it really matters because as 

144.44 146.32 B: okay [laughter] 

145.29 156.14 A: long as we talk about it in general [laughter] but yeah it's kind of it's kind of like there's a middle ground and it's not exactly the same for everyone because how much exercise or caffeine or 

147.30 149.01 B: right um 

156.11 160.91 A: whatever one person takes in just isn't going to be the same for the next person it's kind of like 

159.95 161.92 B: right 

160.95 163.09 A: different for each individual 

162.84 167.33 B: right um but there's smoking like per se i smoke 

167.59 176.53 B: but um but that that doesn't really necessarily bother me unless you know you're a chain smoker pushing your boundaries 

167.67 169.37 A: mhm 

175.27 176.35 A: right 

177.53 183.05 A: there's nothing there's nothing wrong with smoking unless you're being rude about it like 

177.61 178.56 B: (( so )) 

183.41 190.03 A: there's some people who they don't care if their friends don't want smoke near them and they they smoke 

189.12 190.17 B: right 

190.10 197.20 A: in their friend's houses without asking i mean if if you're rude about it but as long as you're not if you know a personal choice then it's okay 

197.06 198.36 B: right right 

198.53 202.78 B: so but you know with this smoking ban it's obviously a lot better now 

202.86 204.73 A: yeah 

202.90 208.20 B: (( you know and all so um let's see what else was there exercise )) 

208.37 209.96 A: gossip was one of them 

209.41 214.74 B: (( gossip um gossip is interesting [laughter] )) 

210.43 213.02 A: gossip [laughter] 

213.96 216.13 A: [laughter] 

215.09 216.19 B: um 

217.31 223.72 A: a lot of people say oh i don't gossip or oh gossip is bad but most people do it a lot of people just 

222.92 226.21 B: yeah i don't think you can help not gossiping really 

225.56 227.39 A: right right 

227.09 229.22 B: as long as it doesn't um 

229.43 234.00 B: you know as long as it's not excessive and you're not doing it to harm someone on purpose obviously 

234.07 235.74 A: (( right )) 

234.16 235.75 B: gossip is okay 

236.06 237.02 B: so 

237.58 238.76 B: um 

239.30 244.43 B: i'm trying to think of [laughter] this is so funny have you done these a lot 

243.99 245.40 A: have i done what 

245.37 248.34 B: done these calls a lot 

246.90 249.05 A: mm this is my second one 

248.94 251.61 B: yeah me too this 

249.30 250.97 A: i did one before 

251.73 256.03 A: so the last topic was a little easier but this one's kind of a little funny 

255.12 261.73 B: is kind of like general yeah um the drinking what about drinking do we talk about drinking 

261.71 262.99 A: sure 

262.91 264.08 B: um 

263.33 275.70 A: um i don't drink a whole lot um my my boyfriend is an ex alcoholic so that's probably the reason why [laughter] [laughter] because you know he doesn't drink at all now 

265.83 266.68 B: right 

269.82 272.78 B: [laughter] right 

275.45 276.45 B: right 

275.75 284.25 A: but again it just comes down to some people can and some people can't and it comes a lot of it comes down to control i guess 

284.01 288.19 B: oh complete- everything is about control in life so 

286.44 291.71 A: right or the lack of it [laughter] 

288.85 296.47 B: yeah [laughter] so i mean they're all really kind of related in that you know in that way in that 

296.66 304.58 B: you know the more you don't do it then the less you do it you know it it depends on your body in a way you know you are so 

302.36 303.08 A: (( right )) 

303.59 305.84 A: (( it it's )) 

306.47 310.11 A: (( [noise] )) 

308.50 309.55 B: (( i'll )) 

310.12 310.90 A: it's 

313.38 314.85 A: all right [laughter] 

314.33 315.71 B: walk away from it 

315.62 317.06 A: [laughter] 

316.32 318.70 B: (( [laughter] of )) 

317.53 318.91 A: and you know it's like 

319.46 333.27 A: excluding the gossiping and ex- the things like smoking and drinking i mean it makes sense for there to be some laws about it you know because those things can affect other people like drinking and driving stuff like that 

331.42 333.91 B: course yeah yeah yeah 

333.30 334.74 A: but at the same time 

335.14 338.69 A: you got to allow for personal freedom and stuff like that too 

338.11 339.18 B: right 

339.52 340.38 B: (( right )) 

339.68 344.48 A: i'm not really one to tell someone you can't do that that's wrong you know it's 

344.58 346.44 A: their decision so 

345.83 347.28 B: yeah 

347.30 351.68 B: (( um i'm sorry i'm like trying to like think ah )) 

351.26 353.31 A: it's quite all right 

352.58 353.64 B: [laughter] 

353.40 355.03 A: [laughter] 

353.92 356.96 B: it's so funny so um 

356.87 359.03 A: is there is there anything 

359.05 364.66 A: like things or other things other like personal habits or 

364.69 371.14 A: i guess personal things that that annoy you if someone else does it too much or doesn't do it at all 

368.81 369.79 B: that annoy 

374.27 376.51 B: personal habits um 

376.77 380.15 B: nail biting drives me crazy but that's not on it [laughter] 

379.95 382.34 A: right well anything you know 

381.81 392.79 B: yeah i think my hardest thing about personal habits is like when you know someone tells your friend or someone tells you oh i'm going to stop doing this oh tell me to stop doing this and we're going to diet so 

392.92 394.42 B: you know tell me to stop 

394.18 404.48 B: ah eating or some people exercise and they want to you to do it and then you know they don't they don't maintain what th- you know what they're you know what they want to do actually 

395.50 397.38 A: right 

403.15 404.86 A: right 

404.24 415.98 B: and that drives me crazy because you become this you know psycho trying to help them when in fact do they really want to be changed do they really want to curb their habits you know like that's like i've got 

413.87 415.75 A: (( right )) 

415.85 419.80 B: a lot of my friends are like that so that's why that's the only thing that drives me crazy 

419.80 424.92 A: yeah people kind of need to do it for themselves i mean it's one thing to ask for a little help and that's okay 

422.13 423.37 B: yeah 

425.01 430.16 A: like because some times people have habits that they just become aware of that they want to change 

429.07 430.23 B: mhm 

430.27 431.29 B: right 

430.30 441.34 A: and that's the way to be like you know if someone told me that i that i do this sometimes and i didn't realize it until now if you see me doing that will you let me know so that i can you know keep working on changing that that's okay 

441.24 445.90 A: but i think someone else to like keep you from doing something that's kind of 

445.92 448.62 A: it's not taking responsibility for it 

447.40 456.15 B: no and it's frustrating it's frustrating because then you look like you know you're trying to help them and they don't want to be helped [laughter] so 

454.27 456.44 A: right [laughter] 

456.48 462.28 B: um yeah i sometimes feel like that that's why that drives me crazy so 

460.98 462.96 A: mhm exactly 

463.09 469.17 B: um what about you any personal habits that drive you crazy that aren't on this 

469.00 475.58 A: um not a not me personally i mean i know some people wh- who have a lot of like little pet peeves like 

475.80 479.89 A: they can't stand it if they're near someone who has like 

480.55 488.34 A: crooked toenails or you know some people have really weird things that that they can't tolerate in other people and 

487.91 489.42 B: right right 

488.51 490.43 A: (( also the people who )) 

490.44 499.42 A: they'll only date people within a certain weight range or a certain height or something like that where it's kind of like a little excessive i think 

499.20 505.99 B: right i think with like the drinking like you know with drinking and with smoking you can you know 

505.84 506.75 A: mhm 

506.21 511.11 B: you can hi- not you can hide it but like you know it's your choice but the people who are like 

511.27 515.11 B: over weight that's something quite simple and i have a lot of friends who are 

515.16 515.97 B: (( you know )) 

516.19 520.27 B: have their discrimination against over weight people 

517.96 519.81 A: right 

520.03 521.21 A: oh definitely 

520.28 530.66 B: um so that's kind of a pet peeve because you know because i have over weight friends and i know they try really hard because and it's frustrating 

530.29 532.27 A: mhm 

530.85 534.47 B: you know with people who meet them or k- or you know who 

534.71 541.54 B: meet some people are really you know how they have these preconceived ideas of how they are how they're going to be or you know 

538.58 542.90 A: (( right exactly )) 

541.67 545.62 B: so that that's that's a pet peeve so of mine 

546.21 548.52 A: yeah i guess to me like 

548.87 557.35 A: a pet peeve is more um i have more pet peeves with people's character more than their behavior if that makes sense like 

557.23 558.68 B: right yeah 

558.05 560.87 A: the the type of judgments they make or if 

560.90 561.73 A: you know 

561.76 568.40 A: i try to you know m- a lot of people try to be open minded it's not easy and everybody has their things 

568.43 572.74 A: they get caught up in where they're judgmental on this or that everybody has that but 

572.32 573.33 B: right 

574.16 580.38 B: no it's only in the sense yeah there's that whole boundary you can get mixed and so 

574.56 575.68 A: some people 

579.55 581.42 A: yeah 

581.74 583.83 B: ah so [laughter] 

583.93 585.38 A: [laughter] 

584.74 585.98 B: um 

586.99 588.65 B: (( let's see )) 

589.49 590.56 B: um 

592.73 593.70 A: i know 

592.96 593.78 B: (( [mn] )) 

593.92 594.72 B: (( hm )) 

594.04 599.89 A: um [laughter] cleanliness is some a personal habit that that affects
