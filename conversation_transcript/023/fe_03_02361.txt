11.17 13.79 A: i've never done this before so lead me on 

13.40 15.10 B: (( uh neither have i )) 

14.49 17.97 A: oh you haven't oh what would you like to speak about 

15.30 16.40 B: no 

17.99 26.07 B: um uh i guess we should discuss uh which the que- the question that they gave us uh 

25.51 26.81 A: what is worse 

26.15 29.48 B: which is worse yeah um 

27.56 28.66 A: okay 

28.91 31.08 A: (( gossiping alcohol abuse )) 

32.07 36.45 B: uh yeah or like caffeine or overeating 

36.07 37.25 A: overeating 

36.59 38.36 B: not exercising 

38.55 41.79 B: that's actually um so which do you think is worse 

42.27 45.29 A: uh probably um 

47.62 49.66 A: alcohol abuse 

49.15 50.10 B: uh-huh 

50.66 51.57 B: why 

51.77 56.37 A: um because it affects so many lives one person who 

56.60 63.75 A: who is abusing alcohol affects the lives of so many others i guess gossiping does the same thing but alcohol seems to have a worse affect 

62.99 69.55 B: mm yeah i i think i would agree like i i can understand using alcohol like responsibly 

69.30 70.44 A: mhm 

69.81 79.52 B: but i think it just gets overused too much and you're right it does affect like families and and all the people around 

77.54 78.55 A: jobs 

78.94 85.87 A: yeah it affects people neighbors everything alcohol has a has a huge affect on people's lives mhm 

85.24 91.84 B: yeah also i think that just like what it's doing to the person too i mean 

91.99 95.77 B: like i've known alcoholics and stuff and they just they 

95.94 99.23 B: start to become different people after long enough 

98.99 102.29 A: and then after a while you watch 'em deteriorate to nothing 

101.17 103.45 B: yeah mhm 

102.84 108.50 A: mhm i've i've seen friends go down i can't you know and after a while you can't even be friends with 'em yeah 

107.91 110.56 B: yeah it's it's hard 

111.79 118.05 B: but i think that like they uh they need support with that from friends and stuff too so 

118.26 119.21 B: like i 

119.83 125.36 A: oh i do too unless they get to the point where you they cause too many problems 

120.65 122.54 B: i i haven't 

124.82 127.88 B: yeah mhm 

127.53 139.50 A: that's where alcohol is like a huge problem you you know they need encouragement but uh i think a alcoholic needs to to come to the realization on their own that they have a problem and get out there and take care of it 

131.57 132.53 B: yeah 

135.98 137.11 B: right 

139.06 141.58 B: yeah i think that's definitely like the first stop 

141.93 148.00 A: [cough] 'cause people try and try and try to help someone and and they just all you do is enable them 

147.85 149.54 B: yeah 

149.71 153.81 B: mhm like i know i have friends that drink a 

153.86 157.57 B: uh in my own opinion more than they should and it just 

157.97 162.96 B: like they just won't accept it and they just deny it like uh 

162.04 163.63 A: mhm 

163.36 169.85 B: they just won't like ac- realize that they do have a problem no matter how many people talk to 'em about it 

171.12 174.29 A: i know lots of people like that too it's very sad 

173.94 175.34 B: yeah 

175.12 180.00 A: yep i have a pro- and and i i get real irritated when people do you know 

178.26 179.22 B: yeah 

179.91 181.43 B: yeah 

180.14 190.30 A: [laughter] 'cause sometimes you know you try to invite 'em around and be around them and then they're loud and obnoxious or what have you and you just you know you just y- there's just too much to deal with 

185.83 186.94 B: yeah 

190.21 191.73 B: mhm 

191.14 194.64 A: i i like to drink too but i also like know when to stop 

194.19 196.04 B: (( yeah i )) 

195.39 202.46 A: or when i don't i always tell everybody okay i drank too much don't listen to a word i say and get me out of here [laughter] 

199.95 202.40 B: think [laughter] yeah 

202.96 213.62 B: yeah and i think that's important i mean i know people that just when they're drinking they have no idea when they've had too much and it just that's when they start getting into trouble 

213.29 220.17 A: oh yeah and they'll get behind the wheel of a car and then it just it can just escalate into major 

217.63 219.72 B: (( mhm )) 

220.22 225.10 B: that's that's one of the worst things for me is when someone drives after drinking that's just 

225.39 229.13 B: i i can't handle that if a friend decides to drive i 

229.43 231.37 B: i won't let 'em 

230.43 234.54 A: mhm mm mm i won't either we've taken many a keys away 

234.49 237.52 B: (( yeah )) 

237.04 240.23 A: i mean we all have to do something to be responsible 

239.76 242.91 B: (( yeah )) 

243.70 244.87 A: (( so )) 

244.98 247.08 A: do you want to discuss overeating 

247.08 249.73 B: uh sure [laughter] 

248.07 249.19 A: [laughter] 

249.35 251.25 A: or not exercising 

251.50 255.10 B: um either one whichever one you want whatever 

254.05 255.54 A: or gossiping 

255.79 258.81 B: sh- sure i think smoking was another one too 

258.59 259.90 A: oh smoking 

259.55 260.55 B: yeah 

259.93 261.39 A: well i'm a smoker 

261.15 263.95 B: oh you are my dad smokes mhm 

261.84 262.93 A: yeah 

263.40 264.44 A: does he 

264.65 273.59 A: well you know i'm a smoker and i've i've i smoked when i was a teenager and then when i had my son i quit 'cause i didn't want my baby breathing the air 

272.52 273.52 B: yeah 

273.63 276.58 A: the polluted air that i called it and uh 

275.09 276.40 B: yeah 

276.82 285.51 A: unfortunately i couldn't stay that way for about five years and i started again but by then of course i could do it outside so um i'm pretty pro smoking 

283.00 283.99 B: uh-huh 

285.58 293.50 B: yeah well i thi- i think that i don't have as much a problem with that as like when i was growing up my dad like 

293.61 306.03 B: he would smoke like when i was in the car or whatever and like that just really irritated me 'cause like i knew what it was doing to me and he knew what it was doing to me and he wouldn't quit and like no matter how much i asked him or or 

306.44 313.02 B: whatever i begged or did whatever i could but he just wouldn't stop and um 

313.31 314.23 B: it was 

313.40 317.33 A: i know because it's hard for us who have smoked and 

317.35 322.26 A: we're like what are you talking about [laughter] it can't it can't be that bad [laughter] 

319.24 321.55 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

321.79 329.47 B: yeah i mean i understand that it's just it's hard thing to see a close family member 

330.38 332.25 B: going through that 

331.90 335.86 A: yeah well i guess i would think that um 

337.46 340.43 A: (( that gossiping would be worse than a cigarette )) 

340.33 346.55 B: [laughter] well i'd i think that they're both pretty uh destructive mhm 

340.84 342.14 A: [laughter] 

345.95 347.85 A: yeah they really are 

348.32 350.67 A: i think it all is and that 

349.87 352.52 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

352.59 356.04 A: the the overeating the non exercising and all like 

355.33 357.26 B: yeah 

356.05 358.62 A: that i guess it's all pretty destructive too 

358.16 360.59 B: yeah 

360.44 368.44 A: but although just there's uh many things that are very destructive so we have to keep things in perspective and not get paranoid 

368.00 370.39 B: yeah [sigh] yeah 

370.90 378.89 A: 'cause i believe that the bombs president bush is allowing to be thrown all over the damn place is worse than um cigarette smoke [laughter] 

378.03 381.78 B: [laughter] yeah i'd i would tend to agree with that yeah 

381.03 389.65 A: you know it's gonna come back into your clouds and come back around to us so i mean eventually it's gonna come back to us so eventually somewhere along the way it's gonna harm us 

389.23 391.32 B: yeah it is 

390.87 396.80 A: and i and uh i guess i think that that's probably worse than smoking 

396.63 400.33 B: yeah and if we keep building up enemies like we are [laughter] 

400.05 403.15 A: uh yeah that'll only be worse yeah 

400.86 401.72 B: some day 

402.07 403.69 B: yeah 

402.98 408.44 A: really that should be the topic [laughter] i could talk for hours on that but but um 

404.50 405.97 B: (( yeah i know )) 

406.70 408.12 B: oh yeah 

408.25 419.02 A: unfortunately it's not and um peo- a lot of people just don't wanna hear the detrimental because then they think we're anti american and that's not the case you know i'm very very patriotic 

409.03 410.41 B: yeah yeah 

415.02 415.99 B: yeah 

416.62 417.87 B: yeah 

418.35 421.49 B: i i've been accused of that many times [laughter] 

420.84 426.43 A: have me too and it kills me because i'm i'm extremely patriotic and always have been 

422.85 423.73 B: yeah 

426.06 427.20 B: yeah 

426.59 436.30 A: but um you know some people just and and i get sick of deal- and i get sick of discussing with people who are uneducated and don't even know what the hell they're talking about 

435.61 441.78 B: yeah having people just like if you don't like it you can just get out of the country you know it's just 

441.15 444.51 A: [laughter] i know and what a stupid response to somebody 

443.45 445.22 B: exactly 

444.59 448.47 A: how how ignorant that goes to show that you don't mm mm 

448.58 450.11 B: (( yeah yeah it's )) 

449.46 450.08 A: (( well )) 

450.21 452.56 B: just makes me angry 

450.78 451.53 A: an- 

451.99 453.47 A: [laughter] 

454.59 455.79 A: (( i know oh )) 

456.19 457.39 A: (( so )) 

458.87 461.84 A: have we done our eight minutes or how do we know oh 

461.25 466.54 B: um i think they said after ten minutes they would tell us when it's up 

465.96 471.63 A: okay so i guess we'd better get back to our topic [laughter] 

469.15 470.49 B: yeah [laughter] 

471.24 475.68 B: uh i i don't even remember what the uh 

475.35 479.93 A: um it was overeating not exercising and the caffeine caffeine 

477.77 487.00 B: oh yeah uh-huh i have i have uh a couple of friends who are overeaters that 

487.14 496.52 B: like i mean are well aware of like what's happening but they just like some of 'em either don't care some of 'em like can't stop or 

497.02 498.06 B: (( you know )) 

498.21 504.58 B: for whatever reason it's they just keep doing it and i mean i think that's 

505.36 509.25 B: uh can be just as destructive as any of the other ones 

508.96 510.34 A: i agree 

511.28 512.29 B: but 

511.30 516.37 A: i mean gives a l- uh they're causes a lot of problems a lot of health problems 

514.33 515.35 B: yeah 

516.11 520.96 B: right and not even not just the health problems but there's also like 

521.03 524.64 B: social problems that it causes for the person i mean they 

523.44 524.29 A: (( mhm )) 

524.78 529.54 B: just why put yourself through that 

529.07 532.67 A: well i think you know i i feel i have i 

532.70 534.02 A: i i don't have a 

534.32 538.78 A: eating problem i'm very tiny i'm [laughter] but um 

536.62 537.92 B: (( [laughter] )) 

539.56 541.31 A: i i guess i f- 

541.44 542.55 A: i feel 

543.56 555.81 A: not really sympathy because it's not sympathy but a a compassion to for people because you don't know when you see 'em if it's a thyroid problem or why they're eating like that or where you know where it comes from 

548.09 549.16 B: yeah 

551.90 552.80 B: right 

554.66 555.73 B: yeah 

555.86 569.55 A: and at the same time i see some people who like you said they just don't care and that's irritating to me when they just like we don't have sweets and stuff in our house all the time coke is a one time once a week deal in our house and 

562.52 563.35 B: yeah 

568.43 569.45 B: uh-huh 

569.53 581.95 A: you know and i mean it's just things that we do it's not because we've we've made it like w- we we're on a schedule if we bring home a coke in the middle of the week it's no big deal but it's just that that's the kind of a schedule we put ourselves on you know 

570.59 571.23 B: (( yeah )) 

580.82 582.36 B: (( mhm right )) 

582.41 592.20 A: and some people don't do that and it's it's kinda sad that but we don't know really know what their issues are we don't know why they're doing it 

590.31 591.25 B: yeah 

591.41 599.95 B: i i think like the majority of society doesn't even bother to find out i mean the first thing that happens is they they see someone
