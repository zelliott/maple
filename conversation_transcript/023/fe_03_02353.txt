0.83 2.03 B: hello 

1.61 2.88 A: hi 

2.48 3.47 B: (( hi )) 

3.22 4.62 A: hi i'm linda 

4.13 5.25 B: i'm kelly 

5.02 8.86 A: hi kelly boy that's a lot of bad stuff all in one there 

9.23 10.87 B: yes it is 

10.18 13.90 A: [laughter] so which is worse 

13.29 15.55 B: (( i hm )) 

16.24 17.60 B: well let's see 

17.42 20.16 A: it's a- alcohol i do not like alcohol 

19.74 23.37 B: yeah i think alcohol is probably one of the worst 

22.09 26.46 A: hm a- and of course overeating [noise] it's so it's bad on your health 

26.23 28.40 B: yeah it is but 

27.32 28.74 A: [laughter] 

28.61 33.15 B: i have a tendency to do that so i won't make that the worst one [laughter] 

31.40 33.92 A: ah i'm with you on that one [laughter] 

33.72 37.95 B: i don't know i think drinking probably because um 

38.03 39.82 A: it impairs your judgement 

40.03 48.60 B: right it impairs your judgement and you know all of them can be an addiction but if you talk about like accidents and like drunk driving 

43.96 44.88 A: yes 

48.70 51.21 B: those kind of things then 

51.26 52.33 B: um 

52.69 53.83 B: you know 

54.11 59.97 B: smoking usually doesn't cause that overeating doesn't lack of exercise doesn't but the drinking 

58.80 65.23 A: no none of those impair your judgement at all so that you get in a car you drive you kill innocent people 

64.99 65.92 B: right 

65.58 66.61 A: um 

66.85 67.78 A: so 

67.90 68.80 B: right 

69.04 74.34 B: so but probably someone who drinks would not agree 

74.61 78.77 B: like if you have someone who who casually drinks and and uh 

74.76 75.39 A: oh 

79.03 88.21 B: you know is a real fitness buff and you know doesn't put anything bad in their mouth or anything then you know they would probably say lack of exercise 

89.04 90.69 B: or eating so 

90.95 96.67 A: which none of 'em is good but as you said none of those impair your judgement you're not gonna hurt other people 

92.36 93.23 B: no 

96.57 97.54 B: right 

97.87 99.42 B: right 

97.88 101.76 A: by you know overeating or i mean you're hurting yourself 

101.22 103.27 B: right right 

102.54 106.10 A: but a- and i have seen out of so many people 

106.35 107.28 A: that 

108.25 110.45 A: drinking i i mean [sigh] 

110.70 113.39 A: they drink so much they end up losing 

114.58 116.54 A: their home everything 

115.40 120.18 B: mhm mhm yeah it's a- you know as far as addictions go 

120.28 121.49 B: you know 

122.17 125.58 B: that one has the most damage that can be done 

125.34 126.39 A: yes 

125.77 139.77 B: you know smoking you know i grew up in a family with a smoker and i can remember riding in the car and just gagging you know my mother is a chain smoker and she'd smoke one after another after another um but uh 

139.79 147.25 B: i don't know you know dad she wasn't really you know she wasn't really hurting us i mean we didn't have to worry about crashing the car or anything 

146.88 150.86 A: right 'cause see i smoke and i still feel 

147.61 148.70 B: but um 

151.34 155.89 A: it's not good for you know ones around you it's not good for yourself 

153.50 154.61 B: mhm 

155.26 156.38 B: right 

156.03 157.56 A: and um 

158.69 163.11 A: you know i wish i could quit uh easier said than done 

160.25 161.36 B: mhm 

162.76 164.61 B: mhm 

163.50 166.63 A: so you should never start but still i yeah i'm not gonna 

167.72 168.61 A: uh 

168.93 171.02 A: crash the car i m- you know 

170.56 171.65 B: right 

171.07 174.10 A: or anything because i'm smoking [noise] 

173.87 177.78 B: i yeah the other one on the list that's interesting was gossiping 

179.05 180.72 A: and that is so harmful 

180.21 187.63 B: i know but it's so easy to do and it's hard how do you know when it's gossip and when it's not 

187.09 195.75 A: that's why i think you should um as the bible says say yay and nay and forget it [laughter] don't say anything else because uh 

192.78 193.97 B: yeah 

195.86 203.41 A: you know [sigh] you could hurt so many people the the old saying you know sticks and stones may hurt my bones but words 

204.41 207.40 A: uh alone will never hurt me whatever it is now [laughter] 

207.12 210.49 B: right right right right 

207.87 209.11 A: it's not true 

209.85 210.91 A: because you 

211.49 214.50 A: you know you can't take words back 

214.06 215.18 B: mhm 

215.32 216.47 B: right 

215.39 217.92 A: once you've said 'em they're said a- 

217.44 218.71 B: right 

217.93 221.44 A: and you know when someone says something bad about me or something 

222.16 228.50 A: i i recall it [laughter] you know i i i think about it it it really does hurt 

227.53 240.36 B: yeah yeah well and sometimes where where i get hung up is like okay i have i have like a circle of friends and i might talk to 'em like every other night or so um my one good friend i talk to every night 

240.20 242.90 B: and like if i talk to my one friend patty 

243.08 254.00 B: and you know she's telling me about her day and she's upset about something or whatever and then i talk to laurie if i tell laurie is that gossiping or is that just sharing with her where patty's at [laughter] 

253.87 257.05 A: b- i think that's sharing sharing concern 

256.88 258.00 B: yeah 

257.37 259.08 A: about a friend 

258.78 264.33 B: yeah well i hope it's that you know i i don't do it out of you know negativity but 

263.83 264.68 A: yeah 

264.41 269.87 B: i don't know that's that's also gossiping is another habit that's and it's hard to break 

269.69 275.54 A: well a- y- the problem i think i know with me a lot of times i say things before i think 

274.94 276.72 B: mhm mhm 

276.23 281.16 A: i mean because i'm a very open person and what's on my mind i say 

279.60 282.20 B: yeah i know 

281.76 284.39 A: and so i'll say it before i even think 

283.99 285.01 B: mhm 

284.76 287.74 A: and not intending to hurt anyone 'cause 

288.28 291.04 A: i would never intentionally hurt anyone 

290.73 291.83 B: mhm 

291.51 294.50 A: but you do it just pops out [laughter] 

292.64 295.94 B: it comes out yeah it just pop i know 

295.99 300.34 B: and then you say oh no you know [laughter] i hope this person doesn't 

298.04 298.90 A: (( yeah i )) 

300.60 302.99 B: doesn't hear or doesn't find out or 

301.81 303.45 A: (( f- yeah )) 

303.83 304.93 B: yeah 

303.92 305.61 A: but still i don't think that's 

306.13 307.83 A: as bad as alcohol 

307.88 311.59 B: yeah no i don't either i don't either i mean maybe 

311.63 312.94 B: i don't know maybe 

312.99 323.18 B: people who don't drink like it could hurt it personally like a friendship but but you know it doesn't cause the damage that you know like you hear some kids who grew up in in alcohol you know 

323.07 324.17 A: yes 

323.48 326.71 B: in a house with a- you know alcoholism and drinking 

327.02 330.11 B: i mean they just have horror stories to tell 

331.34 332.34 B: so 

331.56 339.11 A: yeah a- and so many times because they of the alcohol you can even be apu- abusive to your mate your children 

338.47 339.68 B: mhm 

339.45 341.34 A: and uh 

342.73 345.37 A: that's a horrible thing for kids to grow up in 

344.53 345.54 B: right 

345.67 350.63 B: i don't know though that it was it was right for them to lump that under personal habits though 

351.07 352.42 B: because 

352.73 361.54 B: you know like i don't know i mean it just seems like you know if we're talking about gossiping and alcohol it's like apples and oranges 

361.13 362.14 A: yes 

361.85 364.35 B: you know it's like two different things 

364.82 366.54 B: but um 

366.54 370.55 A: but it wasn't our choice it was theirs so we go along with it [laughter] 

368.11 374.16 B: right that's right that's right that's right [laughter] this is the first this is the first time i've done it so i don't 

370.67 372.44 A: was there any other choice 

373.27 375.77 A: me too this is my first 

374.19 379.04 B: oh is it yeah i let's see it was gossiping drinking smoking 

379.08 384.04 B: overeating or a lack of exercise those were the five 

383.11 386.41 A: it's the lack of ex- exercise just hurts me 

385.97 387.71 B: oh 

387.08 392.45 A: uh i guess in the long run it could hurt my family you know if i end up dying too soon 

391.22 393.84 B: right right 

393.01 393.99 A: uh 

394.24 396.45 B: that's true that's true 

395.23 396.62 A: but um 

397.24 400.26 A: a- a- then again they may be happy [laughter] you know 

399.74 409.13 B: mhm right well and some people i mean you could also i think you could also put in there um over exercising 

400.29 401.66 A: hey she's gone no 

404.44 405.53 A: [laughter] 

408.80 409.94 A: (( [cough] yes [noise] [noise] )) 

409.29 415.89 B: you know i have it is so funny because i have a friend whose husband runs every day 

416.01 423.34 B: he he you know and if he's gotta miss dinner if he has to work late if he has to miss dinner i mean and actually the running comes before 

423.04 424.54 A: [noise] before anything else 

423.46 424.70 B: his family 

424.78 429.03 B: you know like he'll go running instead of coming home and having dinner with his family 

429.20 432.87 B: so i mean a lot of these things you could probably look at 

432.93 434.63 B: at both ways too 

434.13 435.59 A: yeah become 

435.88 437.95 A: obsessive with it uh 

437.10 438.12 B: mhm 

438.74 441.98 A: yeah i could see how that could hurt a family too 

440.37 445.08 B: yeah that would never be my problem but [laughter] 

444.01 451.17 A: no it wouldn't be mine either i have a church next door which has a track that i can go walk one time i started you know 

445.67 446.87 B: [laughter] i would never 

449.02 449.96 B: uh-huh 

451.43 452.77 A: and then i you know 

452.82 456.40 A: well it's too this it's too that i need to do this [laughter] 

455.91 465.23 B: mhm i know it's so easy to fall out of it you know and once you start i joined a local curves place the other the other month and 

458.84 460.53 A: oh it is 

465.57 473.26 B: over my daughter was home over easter break and i didn't go not once and now it's she's been back all week and now it's so hard to get back into going 

472.89 478.05 A: it is once you quit i mean you can come up with so many excuses 

473.67 475.78 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

477.41 478.25 B: right 

478.47 480.05 A: i can anyway 

478.59 487.46 B: but you know it also depends on what what they mean by lack of exercise because nowa- nowadays like even the american heart association is counting like housework 

487.55 491.48 B: as exercise gardening as exercise you know like 

491.64 492.92 B: you know it doesn't 

491.85 493.78 A: yeah at least you're getting out and you're moving 

493.34 502.57 B: right it doesn't have to be a um set you know like going to a gym or biking or you know aerobics or something you know so 

502.72 505.17 B: you know lack of exercise i mean i think 

505.31 513.08 B: you know they they say like thirty minutes four times a week and i think on average i get that just from doing laundry and housework and 

512.82 514.24 A: definitely 

513.19 516.84 B: grocery shop you know lugging in groceries and 

516.23 518.30 A: mowing the grass um 

517.36 518.80 B: mhm 

518.77 522.19 A: you know i do all those things i have a husband who's a stroke victim 

522.18 523.04 B: mm 

522.31 524.90 A: so you know all that is on me 

524.16 525.19 B: right 

524.97 526.41 A: so yeah i i 

526.78 528.61 A: it doesn't show in my weight 

528.20 529.48 B: mhm 

528.75 531.38 A: but i still think it's plenty of exercise 

530.81 538.06 B: yeah yeah well and sometimes it doesn't you know even doing those things even if you're not changing your eating habits 

538.10 543.57 B: you know you're still exercising your heart and your lungs you know doing the activity 

541.27 542.71 A: yeah 

543.93 545.71 B: (( but i don't )) 

546.45 548.73 A: oh 'cause see that's where i worry about him 

548.41 550.51 B: (( know mhm )) 

548.94 550.18 A: 'cause he really 

551.29 554.69 A: because o- of his stroke you know and he 

555.26 559.15 A: he can't walk he can't walk over things he can't use his right arm 

558.80 559.89 B: mhm 

559.53 560.96 A: but he still 

560.99 564.64 A: does not get up and do things and you have to move 

562.61 563.88 B: right 

564.10 566.03 B: right right 

565.83 566.73 A: (( you know )) 

566.67 574.67 B: yeah if you don't the only thing about not exercising especially if if y- you have health problems or you're older is that you'll deteriorate faster 

574.05 575.13 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

574.95 587.04 B: you know and you know i know my my grandmother we all [laughter] we all [laughter] my aunt must've bought her every kind of exercise machine there was you know to make it easy on her because she was just losing so much muscle tone and 

587.01 590.45 B: you know eventually it was even hard for her to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom 

590.08 595.57 A: yeah it is like my husband y- you know it just takes everything he's got to take a shower 

595.48 597.30 B: yeah 

596.01 598.03 A: i mean it just exhausts him 

597.33 598.33 B: yeah 

598.52 599.59 B: yeah
