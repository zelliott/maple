4.51 10.81 B: okay i i heard i couldn't hear all of the topics they were the computer said did you hear everything 

10.85 13.69 A: um yeah the topic is about habits 

13.46 14.65 B: right the 

13.96 16.06 A: and which one you think is worse 

15.78 18.93 B: the eating or the smoking drinking 

18.85 19.74 A: uh-huh 

19.19 22.47 B: but i didn't hear there were some more i didn't hear i thought 

22.13 26.53 A: gossiping alcohol smoking not exercising over eating 

25.98 30.62 B: okay not exercising that's the part i couldn't hear okay and over eating 

28.76 30.07 A: oh right 

30.68 35.83 B: ah gosh that's a good one they're all bad 

34.70 36.34 A: yeah 

36.18 37.25 B: um 

37.34 38.79 B: i have a habit of 

39.02 40.36 B: over eating 

40.41 42.39 B: [laughter] 

40.62 43.44 A: [laughter] i know how that goes 

43.14 47.81 B: it's bathing suit time and i i can barely get in my clothing for the summer 

47.55 48.69 A: i know 

48.26 51.24 B: and and that is a very bad habit over eating 

51.48 53.95 B: so many people are starving in this world 

54.15 54.93 B: (( and )) 

55.05 60.69 B: i take for granted things like that i even throw out food that could have been kept for later 

60.30 61.30 A: mm 

61.08 63.45 B: but so i i think that 

63.94 66.21 B: (( more of a a )) 

66.55 68.82 B: a worser of the evils i think 

68.36 69.58 A: oh right 

69.29 70.52 B: what do you think 

70.22 71.28 A: well 

71.45 73.20 A: looking at the list 

73.34 77.74 A: i think one of the real bad ones is smoking because it's not just you it's other people 

77.87 79.80 A: (( you know th- that can um )) 

80.23 81.55 A: it effects 

82.12 85.40 A: you know like if you're out somewhere other people have to breath your air 

85.15 91.05 B: but we make the choice of doing that we can't say it's bad f- is bad 

91.27 98.78 B: um you and i might choose not to smoke maybe we need to remove ourselves from an environment that's something we can control 

98.57 101.09 A: right well yeah usually 

100.79 101.72 B: mhm 

101.66 105.35 A: i know that when they used to smoke in the workplace that was always really hard for me 

104.70 111.45 B: right an- and least they banned that th- that's a good aspect i i think when 

111.66 115.76 B: even when they say gossiping um at a certain degree 

115.97 121.63 B: gossip passes along information maybe it might not be the correct information all the time 

121.51 122.67 A: oh right 

121.95 130.19 B: but it's the flow of convers- of um passing on information e- each has its good areas and each has its bad areas 

130.77 134.12 B: i i i know when my daughter was pregnant ah last year 

134.17 138.34 B: sh- she was a smoker and as soon as she found out she was pregnant she stopped smoking 

138.43 142.44 B: and she asked her husband to stop smoking while she was pregnant 

142.74 144.82 B: and we said to her jennifer 

145.40 148.83 B: we asked you not to smoke as an adult 

148.94 156.67 B: before you were pregnant and you saw no harm in it but now that you're pr you're pregnant see a harm in it because it's going to affect the baby 

156.24 157.21 A: (( right oh )) 

156.57 164.91 B: that's a choice that you make so how can you ask your husband who's an adult to stop smoking when you wouldn't listen to your parents who asked you to stop smoking 

164.70 165.96 A: oh right 

165.71 168.56 B: so i i look at it as more choices 

168.97 175.27 B: um that we make um and each has its own evil and each has its own good 

175.57 176.75 B: what do you think 

177.23 180.77 A: yeah that's an interesting way to look at it um 

181.39 191.58 A: i just um i just know like if i'm traveling or something and if i have to go where there's smoking i mean i just think it's awful i just wh- and i have an allergy to it too 

191.26 192.20 B: uh-huh 

191.95 202.34 A: and then i really have trouble and my son does as well as it you know then it's like all of a sudden i get the red eyes and itching eyes and i think ugh then i hate it you know 

201.83 205.81 B: right um second hand smoke is bad for you 

205.80 206.68 A: yeah 

205.94 208.71 B: um i i guess out of all of the 

208.76 212.39 B: areas that they mentioned that is the most harmful to you 

213.20 214.17 A: yeah 

213.55 217.48 B: um as a person or because you don't have a choice on that one 

217.94 219.59 B: on the second hand smoke 

220.51 227.03 A: yeah 'cause some of these others like not exercising i mean they just involve you really you know they're just more 

224.76 225.66 B: right 

225.88 226.65 B: (( i )) 

226.99 234.41 B: i i wish could exercise i have a bad back and there's a lot of things i wish i could do and i wish i could go back and and 

234.50 238.65 B: change a lot of my habits then i would be healthier 

238.52 239.59 A: (( ah )) 

239.15 245.54 B: um but um smoking was never one of those things i picked up for some reason 

245.34 246.55 A: oh right 

245.92 248.13 B: an- and that's good [laughter] 

247.55 249.13 A: yeah 

249.25 257.21 A: i know my mom used to smoke but she said when they found out they were pregnant with me they stopped well that was you know a long time ago so 

256.22 257.73 B: [laughter] 

257.30 260.00 A: because she said back then they didn't even know it was bad 

259.40 260.52 B: right 

260.12 262.28 A: they didn't even know it was bad for you so 

261.56 264.69 B: and that's why i can't see why people are suing 

264.83 276.09 B: these tobacco companies you you can't really say it was ba- they didn't know it was bad for you because it's always been labeled on the package that it could be harmful to you to your health 

274.51 275.54 A: yeah 

276.12 283.13 B: so i can't see suing a tobacco company for a product you choose you chose to buy and consume 

283.04 286.27 A: yeah oh i'd agree with that 

285.76 287.56 B: an- an- and that gave w- 

287.57 290.31 B: everybody has a lawsuit against any and everything 

290.59 293.57 B: even the medication we take to make ourselves feel better 

293.64 296.89 B: in some way harms our body because it's foreign 

298.37 299.41 B: don't you think 

298.97 300.57 A: yeah yeah i know 

300.88 304.28 A: i know because i i've studied some things you know with this 

304.36 306.24 A: new thing about eating 

306.41 315.60 A: you know less carbohydrates and stuff and i know this one book i read said you know all medication is bad because it's not you know there's something else wrong you're not dealing with 

311.21 312.54 B: it's bad 

315.00 316.41 B: yeah 

316.00 316.79 A: um 

316.95 322.98 A: if you need some of these things you know then something else isn't right and which i thought was kind of interesting 

323.02 328.60 B: w- i have a bad back and my mother in law she keeps saying oh you complain you complain you complain you complain 

328.62 333.02 B: and ah i just recently went on morphine as a medication for it 

332.51 333.54 A: oh wow 

333.16 348.03 B: and and they're like well we didn't think you were that bad off and i've been in the hospital for a week now with my bad back on just morphine drips and i know it's tearing up my system because it's doing all kind of things to me and 

339.60 340.28 A: (( oh )) 

348.74 349.37 B: (( i- )) 

349.86 350.99 B: i- you know 

351.06 354.74 B: w- we have to take these things to survive 

354.83 359.03 B: we feel but how does that make it you know before all these 

359.51 360.95 B: things came out 

360.55 361.75 A: yeah 

361.36 372.18 B: my mother used to sniff diff snuff i love her to death she's dead now and i thought that was the worst thing and you see these ball players with these big chunks of tobacco in their mouth 

364.56 365.57 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

372.62 374.96 B: we we all make these choices though 

374.84 375.92 A: yeah 

375.34 378.77 B: so we got to live with the consequences of the choices 

378.95 381.34 A: yeah i don't people always realize that 

380.74 389.00 B: yeah um and i think we need to teach our children my son said something so dumb the other day my twenty three year old my my husband said you know 

389.02 391.30 B: smoking is going to kill you one day 

391.40 394.75 B: the idiot said we all gotta die of something 

394.31 395.49 A: (( [laughter] )) 

395.33 398.59 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] we scratched our heads )) 

396.77 397.49 A: yeah 

398.69 400.14 B: (( we couldn't believe it )) 

399.97 402.64 A: yeah it doesn't really make sense does it hm 

402.03 404.13 B: no it doesn't it really doesn't 

404.46 406.12 B: um but 

407.12 410.88 B: i i don't know which is the worser evil than the other 

410.92 414.25 B: i can't i can't say for say how about you 

414.55 418.17 A: yeah um yeah because they're all so bad 

417.57 418.65 B: mhm 

418.87 419.81 A: um 

421.22 424.52 A: yeah i know gossip can do a lot of damage to other people 

425.75 427.37 A: so that can be a bad one 

428.77 429.88 B: (( mm well )) 

430.62 433.97 B: if if gossip is done in the right way 

434.37 438.30 B: if it was just you and i talking and we left it at just that 

438.97 441.98 B: it it doesn't go any further so it doesn't hurt anyone 

442.83 443.91 B: so 

443.70 448.30 A: i think most the time it doesn't it does go further you know some people just can't wait to 

446.30 447.24 B: yeah 

448.98 450.81 B: (( ah not to spread something )) 

451.21 452.14 B: so 

452.98 453.72 B: i 

453.95 457.01 B: i see all of them as negative 

458.43 461.25 B: and i can't rate them one 

461.73 464.33 B: worse than the other i j- i just can't i i guess 

464.41 465.33 A: yeah 

465.28 469.04 B: um i've seen too much in this world look at the war we're in right now 

468.98 470.02 A: i know 

469.79 474.92 B: you know we we just retired out of the military and we wish we could go back in 

475.21 478.55 B: because we're so patriotic we would go back into battle 

478.40 479.27 A: (( hm )) 

478.73 480.09 B: it wouldn't bother us 

480.82 481.74 B: um 

483.00 486.03 B: it it's just what you're willing to live with i guess 

486.73 488.27 B: and can tolerate 

488.35 493.35 B: and if i i'm like you smoking i don't agree with that all 

493.90 495.95 B: and people today 

496.13 499.80 B: why would you pay five dollars for a pack of cigarettes something you're going to 

500.52 506.05 B: burn up that has no value or health con- um 

506.62 508.39 B: (( no value to you )) 

508.27 509.15 A: yeah 

508.65 510.39 B: that's like burning up money 

511.23 514.41 B: just give me that five dollar bill and let me light it light it on fire 

514.09 515.25 A: (( yeah [laughter] ))

517.01 518.23 B: i really do 

520.90 523.16 B: (( so i don't know how to choose that one ))
