37.55 45.16 B: mhm yeah i mean it's cool if you're doing that in moderation but when you know some people are they just go overboard it's like 

45.09 53.26 B: you know too much of a good thing is never good so [laughter] that's the way i feel about alcohol i mean it's cool to do it sometimes but

162.08 166.67 B: exactly there there you go that's what i'm talking about you know [mn] 

168.10 174.62 B: anyway if if i could do something as far as exercise when i'm stuck in traffic that would be cool 

174.98 182.79 A: yeah that would [laughter] i have two hours of commute just you know an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon 

175.02 175.78 B: but 

176.41 177.80 B: [laughter] but who 

179.64 180.80 B: really 

181.83 183.57 B: oh man 

182.96 185.93 A: it's like i'm driving home from work right now [laughter] 

185.52 186.84 B: wow 

187.09 200.51 A: and it's just sitting in here for an hour it's just like i need to do something i wish i could you know utilize my time better than just driving but [laughter] you feel like you wasted two hours of your day just driving to and from work 

192.33 193.39 B: (( yeah )) 

200.86 204.99 B: oh man you don't have to you don't have road rage do you 

205.06 215.20 A: no i don't get road rage unless somebody's like really got it on me [laughter] sometimes you get that one crazy person which you get so mad at that you just got to yell out [laughter] 

209.61 210.53 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

211.91 212.81 B: (( mhm )) 

214.46 222.97 B: oh yeah oh yeah i hate i hate when they cut you off it's like and then they cut you off and then they 

223.21 224.62 B: (( slow down )) 

224.65 227.21 B: i'm like what was that all about 

224.98 226.24 A: yeah 

226.66 228.90 A: or they slip you off and curse you 

228.78 232.30 B: yeah it's like what is that all about like 

232.34 240.52 B: does that [mn] how does that help the situation okay so i passed you and now you want to pass me and it'll fuck me off what is that sign 

239.30 240.53 A: yeah 

240.58 242.87 B: what happened that time nothing 

243.07 245.13 B: but i guess people 

245.18 247.45 B: feel better if they do that 

248.52 250.63 A: i don't know it's just a 

250.60 260.39 A: pain and sometimes what i hate is the ac- the stupid accidents that are caused over you know such stupidity that people do like cutting people off and then it causes a big accident 

260.32 265.95 A: and then they everybody else you know late getting home because you had to cut that person off 

260.43 261.38 B: mhm 

265.35 267.07 B: mhm 

266.43 275.27 A: it's just such a pain [laughter] i sometimes pass five or six accidents on the way home and it's just little stupid fender benders 'cause people weren't paying attention 

271.28 272.28 B: really 

274.88 276.29 B: mhm 

275.50 283.04 A: or they just th- they're in a hurry so fast to get somewhere that they're not looking you know and they're just cutting people off right and left 

280.76 281.84 B: yeah 

282.81 283.82 B: yeah 

283.88 293.19 B: did so do you have to use um the hand the f- what is that like a speaker phone on there now on the on the on the cell 

292.37 297.18 A: they have i don't have the one that's attached to the radio you got the headsets 

296.49 298.56 B: (( phone oh that's a good thing )) 

297.32 299.30 A: where you got your hands free 

298.92 300.68 B: right right 

299.80 303.12 A: you just wear it l- you kind of look goofy but [laughter] 

303.31 306.99 B: yeah but it's a lot safer so they say 

307.07 312.91 B: than having you know to to fumble with the numbers and all that you know at the same time mhm 

311.48 312.28 A: yeah 

312.92 320.12 A: i'm not sure how accurate the one with the radio is because i've had people say that it kind of gets fuzzy and sometimes the ah 

320.27 327.25 A: i guess when you're in certain areas of the city or state that you live in the ah the the fuzziness comes through more 

327.10 328.30 B: (( hm )) 

328.51 337.01 A: so i don't know how good the ones with the radio would be i think the hand i mean the head set one's probably the best option 'cause you can still hear pretty clear 

336.52 342.74 B: yeah yeah that's what i always think of you know it's like both ways you know you can hear and then you can 

342.83 350.04 B: p- speak pretty clearly without having to to scream into the little receiver part 

350.12 351.27 A: yeah [laughter] 

350.18 354.86 B: [laughter] but you know what getting back to the topic because we went 

354.43 357.71 A: yeah i know we got of it [laughter] 

356.62 364.93 B: you know another thing that causes a lot of accidents is like when somebody's like lighting their little funky cigarette you know down 

363.98 372.80 A: yeah i that's what i hate to see an accident has been caused because someone couldn't get their lighter out fast enough to put that cigarette in their mouth [laughter] 

364.99 366.99 B: (( on the driving and )) 

372.73 383.98 B: yeah yeah or either they're trying to get rid of the ashes and some of it falls in their lap and they're like wiping off the ashes and trying to see what they're getting burned or whatever 

383.91 388.48 A: yeah what i hate the most is when they flick their cigarette out the car window and it flicks back at you 

388.33 389.29 B: yeah 

388.49 399.93 A: or when they've finished with it and they throw the butt out it's like you want to scream and at that person so bad it's like do you have to throw that out you know can't you just put it in your ashtray in your car for now until you get home and have a trash can [laughter] 

399.44 405.01 B: exactly exactly w- what are you trying to do start a fire on the side of the road 

404.88 406.05 A: yeah 

405.85 408.04 B: 'cause that's what it seems like 

407.64 410.84 A: i'm not a smoker and i don't ever plan to be [laughter] 

410.09 412.78 B: i hear you i feel the same way 

411.38 422.61 A: that's just the nastiest habit i have so many people relatives and friends that i know who just have nothing but problems from smoking and there's just no pleasure i see in that [laughter] 

419.30 420.57 B: mhm 

422.91 432.81 B: yeah i i i don't get it but you know people do it for whatever as long as they don't do it around me too much is that's all i really care about 

432.71 433.68 A: yeah 

433.57 434.55 B: so 

435.03 442.35 B: we're taking this survey so you are you taking it because you had to find you wanted to do something while you're on your commute 

442.63 444.71 A: yeah pretty much [laughter] 

444.00 445.13 B: (( hm )) 

444.84 449.02 A: and and just you know to help out with whatever research they got going 

449.07 450.05 B: yeah

454.00 454.88 B: really 

454.86 455.93 A: yeah 

455.09 461.01 B: yeah that sounds about right i guess that's about how long it takes for them to process everything 

460.71 462.37 A: you've been doing it long 

461.88 464.23 B: no this is my first time too 

464.17 465.53 A: oh really

474.27 478.94 A: um they said ten minutes i don't know how long it's been [laughter] 

479.33 484.04 A: i think th- they interrupt you with a the computer when it when it's finished 

483.61 484.81 B: probably
