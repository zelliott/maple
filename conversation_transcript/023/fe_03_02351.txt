58.51 60.32 B: like um women connect 

60.50 62.92 B: is that um p- the place that you went to 

62.20 67.60 A: no um about dot com they have like pregnancy forums and like all kinds of stuff 

66.23 67.78 B: oh wow wow 

67.85 69.58 A: that's where i heard about it at 

69.20 70.00 B: oh 

69.73 73.26 A: i'm not actually pregnant but i've been on there since i was pregnant [laughter] so 

70.23 71.16 B: interesting 

72.44 73.43 B: yeah 

73.76 78.34 B: now which one do you think is the um the worst gossiping 

78.66 82.52 A: well i don't think gossiping [laughter] is um no 

78.72 79.62 B: um 

80.65 81.46 B: no 

82.22 84.20 B: smoking or 

83.26 86.50 A: i would say like smoking or like excessive alcohol 

86.15 87.98 B: yeah excessive alcohol 

87.60 88.65 A: yeah 

88.04 90.70 B: and what was the other one um not exercising 

90.29 92.27 A: yeah i think and overeating 

92.60 93.60 A: (( was the other one )) 

93.35 95.32 B: exercising yeah 

95.78 97.15 B: i honestly 

97.32 100.58 B: um i think um gossiping because 

99.68 100.95 A: really you do 

100.64 104.48 B: yeah because you know why because when uh people gossip 

104.61 108.52 B: about other people they're not there to protect themselves you know 

108.23 109.42 A: yeah 

108.83 109.88 B: so 

110.51 114.63 B: and i feel like if anyth- if you have to s- um say anything about somebody else 

114.78 122.43 B: if you are willing to talk about them behind their back you have to be willing to talk to them and actually say it to their face if they ever confronted you too 

123.61 126.45 B: so gossiping i don't think is um 

126.40 131.65 A: [noise] and you think that is worse than than smoking or like an alcoholic or something like that 

126.97 127.69 B: i don't 

131.07 133.20 B: well smoking and um 

133.79 136.13 B: and alcoholism is like 

136.15 137.44 B: is an addiction 

138.26 139.23 B: so 

139.31 141.95 B: yeah it is it is worse for your health 

142.34 144.75 B: wise but willingly to gossip 

144.94 146.13 B: it's um 

146.38 154.80 B: not harming anybody but the other people that are are not around this time the the smoking and uh drinking yeah like you're hurting yourself 

154.99 157.20 B: smoking you're hurting other people around you 

157.82 160.16 B: but you know it's really hard to choose between 

160.29 161.73 B: i guess those three 

162.56 166.17 A: actually n- i never would've thought of gossiping that way i mean 

167.22 169.99 A: [sigh] yeah it's bad but 

167.53 168.88 B: (( well i work in an office )) 

169.21 170.82 B: i work in an office [laughter] 

171.06 171.94 B: so 

171.68 176.43 A: oh i'm sure i guess i'm a stay at home mom so i'm not around it any more [laughter] 

174.25 175.14 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

176.57 177.62 A: um 

178.00 183.15 A: i don't know just like my mother in law died of cancer she didn't smoke but i 

183.18 185.69 A: just from her dying and all that kind of stuff 

185.36 186.40 B: oh yeah 

185.70 187.49 A: i'm just like you know 

187.38 193.58 A: we're really strong in like not you know not letting people smoke around our son and stuff like that i mean my parents smoke 

191.69 192.52 B: (( well mhm )) 

193.43 203.25 A: so it's really hard because they have to like you know go outside when he's over there and stuff like that so i see that as more of a problem because that's what i deal with every day i mean not every day but 

202.55 203.89 B: yeah when you visit 'em 

203.59 206.81 A: but when i'm sitting at home nobody's really gossiping about me 

206.16 214.32 B: oh yeah see we- you know i i i mean i was a stay at home mom too for for a long time but then when when i went back to work i mean you see it all 

214.30 226.51 B: um and i work for um you know a company that there's many women and even men gossip so and i see what it does when they um to the other people when they when they when they do it so i guess 

226.88 231.47 B: you know 'cause to think out of all three no k- gossiping will not kill you 

231.70 236.79 B: in that form but yeah smoking and not exercising and excessive drinking 

236.68 237.76 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

237.04 238.73 B: i guess that its worse 

238.06 252.87 A: [noise] [noise] well then like the drinking thing i just i had a friend that was killed in a car accident because he was drinking so i see that as [noise] being pretty bad [noise] i mean but [noise] i mean i haven't actually been in like a gossiping situation probably since high school i mean college wasn't really like that but 

243.08 243.74 B: (( mm )) 

245.39 246.42 B: yeah 

249.93 250.85 B: yeah 

251.68 253.89 B: yeah yeah exactly see i 

253.12 257.07 A: but i know a lot of people say that the work place is just like high school because [laughter] 

256.52 258.07 B: (( mhm exactly )) 

258.65 259.52 A: (( mm )) 

259.69 263.53 B: because [cough] excuse me i i have that cold um 

262.70 263.94 A: yeah 

264.52 273.48 B: i think of yeah exactly when i see um i mean we all it's in our nature to gossip but when people gossip it's like you know i feel like i'm a child 

274.35 286.38 B: you know it's same thing that you just you expressed like you feel like you're in high school it's the same thing that's what it is it's a whole bunch of people talking it doesn't change you know like you were in high school and same thing 

284.85 286.01 A: yeah 

286.51 288.29 B: you know but um 

287.96 289.69 A: that's pretty sad [laughter] 

288.95 295.43 B: yeah it is you know 'cause they have nothing else it's like they're benefiting from somebody else's poor uh 

295.47 300.46 B: poor circumstances they're benefiting and getting some kind of self glorification 

296.82 297.77 A: yeah 

300.84 302.38 B: in something like this 

301.10 302.89 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

302.77 306.94 B: but i understand about the um the alcoholism because you know 

307.06 311.37 B: you know i had a relative i grew up with that was alcoholic but um 

310.18 311.73 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

311.39 313.81 B: you know so it does do things to you 

314.74 323.72 B: and um if y- you know it's hard to control unless they get h- you know tha- that person fortunately came from a long long family of alcoholics 

323.73 325.10 B: so they were able 

325.25 330.41 B: th- they were actually the only one to um not be an alcoholic to this day so 

330.61 331.88 A: well that's good 

331.28 332.90 B: you know they came out of it 

333.25 334.14 B: so 

335.37 336.90 B: (( [mn] [sigh] anyway )) 

336.86 347.11 A: well that's funny that [laughter] what you said about the gossiping i never really i don't know i thought the others were worse but gossiping y- actually you have nothing to do with and you have no control over so that is pretty bad [laughter] 

341.06 342.24 B: you never thought of it 

346.58 360.21 B: yeah you know that's when i had a look and i observe and um and then when people come to me i'm like well i don't think that and said and you know and then um and then i'll say they say so you know but i whatever i have to say 

360.44 368.18 B: i'm willing to say to their face and everybody knows me and how i am about that subject [laughter] so it's just real funny that the topic was that 

368.76 369.84 B: but um 

370.02 372.09 A: so do you have problems at work then 

371.67 377.36 B: oh me personally no no honestly me personally no but it's just like i feel bad 

372.70 373.87 A: yeah 

377.53 388.29 B: for the people that i see in my office because you know there people have nothing else better to do and it's hard enough to be around it because you're right there anyway 

387.74 388.92 A: yeah 

388.33 394.60 B: and it's like they talk to you but honestly no i mean i probably am [laughter] that i don't know about 

392.80 399.12 A: well i just wonder if you have a problem because people know that you won't you know bad mouth other people just for the fun of it 

398.49 402.04 B: right or get self um glori- you know they have or they're bored or 

401.89 403.01 A: yeah 

402.61 415.72 B: you know and i you know i'm the type person that would actually tell them we- well why are you saying that did they say this to you or i said um you know you know what i mean along those lines i tell them like that 

416.33 417.85 B: (( [cough] excuse me )) 

419.01 420.83 B: but you know anyway 

419.83 423.41 A: well i'm kinda glad i don't work right now [laughter] 

421.89 430.67 B: yeah well i think it's like that all places and like i mean even my husband where where he works and he works um in a school and um 

431.10 432.39 B: even there 

431.14 436.02 A: you know i wouldn't think it would be well it's usually all women at school that's i have an education degree 

435.64 436.69 B: mhm 

436.11 441.01 A: so i would just think that teachers could like rise above something like that [laughter] 

439.27 452.17 B: oh no no no no no no no they all gossip about each other and i said no he says yes and the funny thing is they gossip to my husband [laughter] because he's like a manager there so they all go and tell him stuff 

452.42 454.07 B: you know at his school 

453.69 454.81 A: yeah 

454.23 455.84 B: you know so um 

456.33 458.30 B: it's really funny that you know 

458.17 461.99 A: that's funny you're supposed to be educating kids about not doing the same thing 

458.34 459.17 B: at 

460.06 461.24 B: exactly 

461.61 463.83 B: yeah yeah that's just like 

462.67 464.67 A: it's pretty hypocritical [laughter] 

464.34 469.78 B: yeah it's just that i think it's just part of our nature that some people you know can't control but 

469.22 472.76 A: well i can't say that i've never you know not gossiped about somebody 

472.33 475.96 B: no of course not but i never um did it you know where i know 

476.03 478.93 B: to hurt that person or or not willing to say it 

479.28 481.46 B: to their face if i had something to say 

480.36 484.33 A: well most of the stuff i say i'd probably say to their face but 

483.33 484.25 B: yeah 

484.34 485.28 B: (( just got to )) 

484.40 490.36 A: that's just because i don't care i mean [laughter] what are they gonna do and if it's the truth 

485.82 488.38 B: yeah n- [laughter] exactly [laughter] 

488.87 489.79 B: yeah 

490.32 491.59 B: yeah 

490.97 491.87 A: but
