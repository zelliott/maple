4.52 5.56 B: okay 

5.45 10.30 A: you know what i i didn't hear what the topic of the of our c- call is supposed to be 

9.73 20.35 B: you know i couldn't get i couldn't understand it either it had something to do with habits and i heard something about smoking alcohol and everything else was mumbled 

16.75 17.47 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

19.96 28.37 A: oh well i oh jeeze i was just switching phones when the [laughter] this is my first time calling is it is it yours 

22.65 23.49 B: [laughter] 

27.78 30.14 B: it's the first time yes [laughter] 

29.12 32.84 A: oh so we're two rookies well hopefully they'll be able to uh 

33.36 36.99 A: to use our little conversation here nonetheless 

36.69 43.19 B: i don't know whether or not they're actually using the topic that we're speaking or if they're just trying to get speech patterns 

40.03 41.19 A: yeah 

42.55 49.47 A: right well you have a beautiful way of speaking and um so they'll just have to take what they can get 

48.83 52.19 B: [laughter] that's very nice [laughter] 

49.66 60.99 A: [laughter] [laughter] so but you heard i i y- i heard personal habits but you heard a little bit more you think it has um do with smoking and alcohol 

60.26 65.83 B: alcohol it says and i i wasn't quite sure 'cause it w- it came through mumbled something 

65.95 72.27 B: i don't know whether or not they were asking which one was worse or how would you rate these or what it was you know like the way they were talking 

72.52 79.68 B: the way i would almost figure it is it smoking is worse than drinking or is drinking worse than smoking or do you hate both of them or what so [laughter] 

78.98 82.70 A: let's let's flow with that that's that i could i could deal with that 

80.44 81.91 B: [laughter] 

82.33 83.81 B: okay [laughter] 

82.88 84.72 A: where where you located celeste 

84.38 85.81 B: up state new york 

85.36 87.84 A: uh-huh and i'm uh down state new 

87.52 89.37 B: (( oh where where where )) 

88.06 91.31 A: york i'm in brooklyn new york yeah 

90.01 93.52 B: brooklyn okay i i've originally come from long island 

93.02 100.24 A: uh-huh uh-huh i in fact was drinking last night [laughter] so it's a good day 

97.42 99.51 B: [laughter] 

100.03 101.01 B: (( yes )) 

100.19 108.98 A: and and now and now here in new york city you can't smoke in bars so it's a whole nother a whole new a whole new atmosphere you know 

108.21 114.59 B: see i don't think that that's right because we have a little tiny diner in our town 

110.31 111.22 A: yeah 

114.61 124.95 B: that um everybody goes there to smoke and it's really for a non smoker it is obnoxious to go into it i will not i will not go into the place 

115.90 119.03 A: (( yeah [sigh] yeah )) 

122.55 123.84 A: mhm 

124.54 126.06 A: mhm 

125.11 127.08 B: but people that smoke 

127.15 136.34 B: they can go there they can enjoy it so i i think that the owner of the facility should have the right to decide whether or not he wants a smoking or non smoking 

128.87 130.15 A: yeah 

136.45 141.33 A: and there there is no there is no law at all in your uh in your town 

141.34 142.49 A: right 

141.87 146.94 B: they're trying to en- enact one but i'm not sure whether or not it was passed or not 

146.38 152.36 A: i think it's i was i'm a i'm a form- i'm an ex smoker nothing worse than an ex smoker 

151.43 153.06 B: that's what i am also 

152.39 155.54 A: yeah [laughter] congratulations how long has it been 

153.60 155.39 B: [laughter] 

155.66 158.29 B: oh i'd say pr- close to ten years 

157.97 165.17 A: oh likewise so my anivers- my ten year anniversary is coming up this summer as a matter of fact it's incredible so 

163.18 164.05 B: mhm 

164.79 167.13 B: it is but my husband smokes 

166.63 168.98 A: oh mhm 

167.37 171.78 B: so i still get the [laughter] the second hand smoke 

169.91 170.92 A: yeah 

170.94 182.24 A: yeah well it's still it's still you know as much as they talk about second hand smoke i there's uh nothing worse than first hand smoke it's got gotta be the truth i would figure so 

178.42 179.28 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

181.87 188.67 B: but i would think that of the two alcohol or smoking i would say smoking is the worst 

188.25 189.76 A: yeah 

188.98 197.97 B: because not everybody who drinks is an alcoholic who is addicted to alcohol but everybody who smokes is an addict to nicotine 

197.73 210.93 A: well y- i i went to uh last night when i was drinking uh which is not something i do very often but i went to something last night which was a trip i mean since we're both calling this thing probably 

210.93 224.24 A: because of the money and secondarily for the educational um betterment of the world uh then you probably would've loved this too i went to a thing last night given by the johnnie walker 

216.78 217.85 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

224.30 237.66 A: uh by the way i'm just talking as as if no one's listening you know and no one's uh you know not that i'm gonna be indiscreet or anything but i was um i i was um uh i aw- made aware of um 

229.07 231.21 B: right right [laughter] 

237.73 244.69 A: johnnie walker black the the scotch company is hosting various parties in 

244.87 249.38 A: in clubs in manhattan and around the country in the major cities 

249.31 263.13 A: and and you go there and i went there last night and i hadn't been to one before and you go there in a in a nice club that i'll probably never be go to again um uh just you know 'cause it's not in my circle 

262.90 270.31 A: uh of an hour's worth of uh open bar and um hors d'oeuvres passed around 

270.32 273.97 A: and then you sit down to a scotch tasting 

273.67 276.13 B: oh that sounds really cool 

275.09 278.21 A: y- yeah really absolutely and they have 

277.30 280.47 B: since i'm since i'm a scotch drinker [laughter] 

279.76 284.92 A: oh really oh huh well unfor- are you you say how how far up state are you 

285.42 287.06 B: you know where syracuse is 

286.82 291.34 A: syracuse uh-huh mhm mhm and is rochester there also 

287.89 289.23 B: it's in that area 

290.81 294.47 B: rochester is about um forty five minutes away from us 

293.86 298.68 A: mhm so you're so you're not even um yeah you pro- 

298.70 308.25 A: um if y- you wanna look at what's what's the website is it's johnnie walker r._s._v._p. dot com you can just check it out if you like um 

307.38 308.71 B: yeah i might 

308.16 316.11 A: and it's johnnie if you're a drin- if you're a scotch person you probably know it's a an n. n. n. i. e. not n. n. y. 

315.77 316.69 B: okay 

316.22 323.02 A: [cough] uh but uh they yeah they don't they i don't i think new york city was the only new york 

323.21 330.19 A: city new york state city in new york state that they were doing it in but various you know major cities around the country 

325.94 326.98 B: mhm 

329.99 343.19 A: but what a but what a trip it is but the reason why i bring that up actually is in response to what you said and that had to do with um people that smoke are addicted to smoking and people that drink are not necessarily so because i was 

343.59 357.63 A: w- um we met and were chatting with and sitting with and with these uh people from france and [cough] they they were abso- the three of them three young people in their twenties they each of them were 

357.52 370.21 A: smokers who just smoke either when they drink or only at night time one or the other they said one they said i don't drink during the day i don't smoke during the day at all and the other one is i only smoke when i'm 

370.25 376.43 A: i only smoke when i'm drinking and the other one said something like um i only smoke when i'm on vacation or something so 

376.32 379.79 B: i've known a couple of people like that and i tried it 

379.46 380.72 A: yeah 

379.83 391.51 B: i tried just having well you know when i stopped smoking and then my husband was continued to smoke i when we were out i would have one of his cigarettes just when we were having a drink 

390.96 392.81 A: yeah mhm 

391.65 396.93 B: or just when we were here or just when we were there but it snowballed with me i 

396.19 397.93 A: oh yeah 

396.99 403.00 B: you know then it was like well have one every night have one every time you come home from work have 

399.65 400.79 A: mhm 

403.08 405.39 B: so i could never be that type of a smoker 

404.73 418.85 A: nor i oh no absolutely not in fact when i quit smoking it was uh only the second time in my life that i tried and the other time i only tried for a day you kn- i i made the mistake of trying to quit coffee and cigarettes on the same day and it was like 

417.63 418.92 B: [laughter] 

418.80 429.25 A: my head exploded [laughter] i think but only yeah only that one day and i yeah i've been smoking do you know what the average age is when people start smoking 

428.69 429.93 B: start 

429.48 430.72 A: yeah 

430.05 432.45 B: i would probably say about thirteen or fourteen 

431.81 438.44 A: yeah absolutely right yeah and that's when i started in fact and um and i s- and i'm now forty six or so 

438.44 452.35 A: um amazingly so and um [laughter] i can't i can't believe it but it does kind it gets up there um and i i you know i smoked every just about every day in my life until uh s- you know ten years ago 

441.73 445.18 B: [laughter] it it it catches up with you i know 

452.28 459.41 A: um but the thing is that that once i quit i just knew that i could never smoke another cigarette 

459.43 460.86 B: that's it 

460.29 466.63 A: and and you know it's easier that way it's the it's like um it's absolute 

466.89 475.29 A: and in fact i have a little mantra that i used for many years which is i will never smoke the first cigarette i will never smoke the first cigarette 

475.32 479.01 A: and the truth is if you never smoke the first cigarette you'll never be a smoker 

478.56 479.69 B: that's true 

479.25 487.74 A: yeah yeah and i probably won't be a heroine addict either for the same reason but [laughter] [laughter] 

479.81 480.99 B: that is true 

485.19 486.60 B: [laughter] 

486.89 489.09 B: it's too expensive 

488.47 491.27 A: yeah that's that is true 

490.72 493.99 B: both habits heroine and cigarettes [laughter] 

492.30 497.40 A: yeah well i've i've tried one and uh [laughter] and the other's out of the question but 

496.79 498.39 B: [laughter] oh 

498.10 500.42 A: but cigarettes is uh 

500.65 506.13 A: yeah i would say that cigarettes is worse than than alcohol too though 

506.27 511.59 A: though both can do awful danger- awful dangerous things to your to your body 

511.08 513.13 B: yeah but um i 

513.25 516.47 B: i think most people that are drinking 

517.12 521.39 B: they're doing so you know maybe one drink a night or something 

521.68 526.07 B: something very modest you know maybe on weekends or something like that whereas 

522.76 523.65 A: (( mm )) 

526.13 534.29 B: most of smokers i know it's just constantly you know at work they'll run out and they'll uh have their cigarettes during their break 

534.06 537.10 A: oh i- in your workplace there's no smoking allowed 

536.69 538.15 B: no smoking at all 

537.36 539.72 A: oh uh-huh what kinda workplace is that 

539.11 540.17 B: hospital 

539.87 541.49 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

540.51 548.53 B: and [laughter] i've often said the only reason that smokers get pneumonia is because they have to go outside and smoke 

545.82 554.25 A: [laughter] [laughter] you know a um a s- hospital close to me um 

554.28 565.87 A: not too far from me is coney island hospital they built this glass enclosed structure outside the main one of the main e- uh entrance areas for people to smoke in 

565.91 567.06 B: wow 

566.60 568.22 A: yeah 

567.98 570.91 B: now do the patients go down there and smoke 

570.88 575.74 A: i only saw it once i i don't think so i don't think so at all it's i think it's for 

575.85 579.95 A: (( i don't know you know i i only saw it once you know )) 

579.13 584.27 B: because a lot of times some of our patients will actually go in their bathrobes 

583.66 586.00 A: oh yeah sure 

584.32 585.79 B: outside 

585.83 592.60 B: and you c- you're not allowed to smoke in front of the hospital you have to go it's like almost across the street 

591.98 593.75 A: right right 

592.83 599.89 B: across the circle whatever you wanna call it and they actually go out there because they're not allowed to smoke any place in 

594.75 595.76 A: right 

599.21 599.95 A: huh
