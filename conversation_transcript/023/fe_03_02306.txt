1.57 3.81 A: hi this is clovis 

3.48 6.99 B: hi um okay i guess we're supposed to talk about colds 

6.68 10.05 A: i [laughter] well 

7.28 8.59 B: [laughter] 

10.45 13.77 A: i usually do not get them i mean 

15.36 15.95 A: (( uh )) 

16.44 20.93 A: do i mean do you get them when when the season changes i really don't 

20.56 25.63 B: um i it's funny i used to get them a lot as a child and 

25.72 31.84 B: and all through school and college i used to always get them when the seasons changed um but 

31.97 39.07 B: after i guess maybe about five six seven years ago i went vegetarian and to be honest i haven't gotten sick since 

39.41 41.09 A: oh well i was 

41.23 45.28 A: i guess i was a vegetarian during my high school 

45.33 51.44 A: school years up until now and i still am so maybe that's probably why [laughter] [laughter] 

50.44 52.43 B: [laughter] that's so funny 

52.81 61.65 B: um but i i notice that with my coworkers and such and other people that that does happen that they do get sick when the seasons change 

61.87 66.69 A: well usually the ones that i work with they have allergies so 

66.84 70.28 A: it gives them the appearance of a cold but 

70.46 71.64 A: um 

73.53 76.04 A: i can't really say that you know 

76.32 86.41 A: i have i mean you know i haven't really worked with people that get sick during the season uh i mean every once in a while i'll end up with the flu when i'm going into the uh 

80.90 81.85 B: right 

86.58 88.76 A: the winter uh season 

89.10 90.22 B: (( right right )) 

91.05 94.75 B: and i sometimes i don't i think it's not just the season but 

94.81 100.31 B: usually when you go to work they have um controlled temperature there and 

98.65 101.52 A: (( i know that's the problem oh yeah it's the same )) 

100.40 105.03 B: right it i mean it's hot outside and you go into work and it's a meat locker 

104.18 109.05 A: (( thing [laughter] )) 

106.63 118.46 B: or um or it's freezing outside you go into work and it's a sauna or it's it's one or the other you can never win and maybe it's that like contributing to it 

110.74 112.21 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

117.76 121.12 A: my god i thought it was only my workplace [laughter] 

120.44 122.77 B: i think it's everybody's workplace 

124.23 125.31 B: um 

125.10 133.43 A: now i have i i have to say that maybe you know like you said i don't think it's really the season i think it's the workplace itself 

134.38 149.15 B: right right and when the seasons change also you don't always know how to dress because it could one day could be really warm and the next day could still be kind of cool while the the weather's trying to adjust to what season it really wants to be 

148.91 150.18 A: i know 

149.77 152.17 B: and tha- that's a be a factor 

154.13 157.40 A: well florida i live in florida so 

156.34 157.48 B: oh 

157.49 162.56 A: so i mean we have really had some really strange weather 

162.60 176.34 A: i mean you know we're we're usually one day i well you know i have to really say during this summer because of the strange weather that florida has i really have to say maybe it is you know during the 

176.18 182.78 A: that season they do get get colds because now i mean from one day it's 

183.26 187.98 A: thirty eight degrees and the next day is sixty or eighty 

187.00 188.44 B: (( mhm right )) 

188.30 189.23 A: so 

189.29 195.39 A: i guess florida can say that you know the the way the weather is people end up with colds 

195.43 209.63 B: oh i'm i'm actually calling from new york myself and new york city to be exact and we we have all four seasons very distinctly so i guess florida is more warm so that even your winter isn't that harsh 

198.32 199.55 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

209.18 210.50 A: right 

209.55 212.70 B: but um this year we had a bad winter and 

212.73 223.82 B: our you know our spring is really dragging it like we're everyone's really excited to get into summer and people are walking people are walking around wearing tank tops and things but it's really not hot enough for it yet 

224.06 228.26 B: but people are over excited so they're they're really um dressed 

228.34 229.26 A: well um 

228.48 229.89 B: inappropriately 

229.76 240.24 A: i mean that's what i'm saying even with florida this year is that i mean we having weather because one day it even we had little um 

240.60 249.95 A: it wasn't a lot but we had like sprinkles of snow i mean the weather the temperature had gotten to that place where 

250.37 252.65 A: we were able to have snow 

252.47 254.02 B: right wow 

254.94 255.79 B: wow 

256.47 259.86 B: i think one of the other questions they asked was about going to the doctor 

260.70 266.80 A: well i really don't go because my cold is not that severe where i have to go 

266.50 273.46 B: right yeah i haven't gone to the doctor for a cold since i was a child and my parents took me i 

273.64 280.29 B: yeah i i wouldn't go to the because by the time you get an appointment and you get there it's kind of over [laughter] 

276.97 277.55 A: (( yeah )) 

279.92 282.05 A: [laughter] 

282.05 285.32 B: and usually you could just get over the counter stuff now these days 

284.98 286.26 A: i know 

288.24 288.95 B: (( yeah mm )) 

290.52 292.79 B: yeah it's funny that neither of us really get sick 

292.76 293.53 A: (( i know )) 

293.46 296.64 B: [laughter] it's the wrong topic 

293.91 295.62 A: [laughter] 

296.26 297.79 A: [laughter] 

299.26 301.45 B: but thank god for that [laughter] 

300.61 302.58 A: i know thank god [laughter] 

303.64 304.82 B: (( let me see )) 

305.72 307.25 B: (( colds mm )) 

307.13 320.77 B: well at work we um we have free flu shots in the fall that we give to employees and a lot of um our employees actually do participate and they get their flu shots so i guess we don't have as many people getting sick 

321.72 322.46 A: (( mm )) 

323.09 329.21 A: well i mean we have that also but i have never gone for the flu shot 

329.65 330.65 A: um 

331.72 336.81 A: i i think it's more i don't think it's beneficial for me 

336.18 337.18 B: right 

338.17 346.14 B: right yeah i haven't gone either just because i don't get sick and i just figure if everyone else is getting the flu shot then they won't get and then i won't get sick 

345.74 347.43 A: (( [laughter] i know [laughter] )) 

346.33 347.56 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

354.57 355.61 B: (( well )) 

357.71 360.46 A: what else did we have to talk about 

359.85 363.54 B: um mm about colds let's see 

365.15 366.66 B: i well 

366.90 369.51 B: um mm about change of season and colds 

373.44 379.99 A: well like i said there is in florida it's more of allergies than anything else 

378.89 380.38 B: right right 

390.37 391.38 A: um 

391.06 394.43 B: i think people in certain occupations are more prone to colds 

394.57 401.65 B: because i um my friends that i have that are teachers they're always getting sick because they get it from the kids and the kids give it to each other 

401.27 402.28 A: right 

401.67 405.27 B: and then they bring it home and then they bring it back and it's you can't win 

405.37 406.51 A: i know 

405.64 410.60 B: when you work with um kids so directly and just things like that 

410.61 416.64 A: well even in the office it's you know because one person i guess even in the office 

417.56 422.73 A: that circulates around also because of you know by the time 

422.89 427.65 A: you have the you know by the time they have the symptoms the cold's already there 

427.00 428.09 B: (( right mhm )) 

428.85 433.69 A: so when one person has a cold it spreads around 

435.29 439.29 B: mhm yeah and there's not always great circulation of air in the office either 

439.54 442.72 B: i mean i i know i sit in an office that doesn't have a window 

443.53 445.89 B: so we don't really have any air movement 

446.43 450.08 A: well we have windows but not the ones that you can open 

449.46 451.98 B: right right those too 

457.72 458.71 A: um 

462.34 464.20 A: well 

465.68 466.54 B: [laughter] 

465.98 468.00 A: (( [laughter] )) 

469.61 476.72 B: i think people are also preventing colds these days like people seem to be more health conscious and taking vitamins 

476.55 477.59 A: yeah 

476.78 490.35 B: and really like doing the whole herbal thing and just being more knowledgeable about that it used to be that not too many people were involved in that but now in your supermarket you could buy all kinds of herbal remedies and just alternative medicine type things it's very mainstream now 

490.55 496.39 A: and a lot of people like you said a lot of people now are taking vitamin c. tablets 

490.67 491.43 B: (( like )) 

495.69 497.03 B: mhm mhm 

499.67 504.13 B: yeah i know that like when i sometimes feel that i might be getting cold i i 

504.45 511.44 B: i take a vitamin c. tablet or a zinc tablet um just to ward it off because i don't really like taking actual medicine 

513.16 514.59 A: i know it's 

515.95 521.22 A: i i don't think that the the medicine i to me i don't think it really works because 

523.64 529.69 A: you never have the same cold once and and you know you never get the same cold again so 

529.34 530.21 B: right 

529.83 533.83 A: you can't cure it anyway because it's never the same one 

533.54 537.86 B: right yeah i don't think it's a cure it's just to make it more bearable 

537.27 538.86 A: mhm 

537.93 539.90 B: so that you can just get through the day 

541.32 546.56 A: i know but sometimes even the ones that says non drowsy your system 

547.29 548.53 A: seems to 

549.47 551.25 A: collide with that 

550.82 552.43 B: right right 

552.65 556.38 B: so even if you're not falling asleep you're just feeling kind of loopy 

556.07 557.48 A: mhm 

556.59 559.51 B: and that that's just as bad 

558.85 560.04 A: i know 

565.96 566.78 A: (( um )) 

573.63 575.84 B: man these seems like ten long minutes 

576.08 578.44 B: [laughter] 

576.36 578.39 A: [laughter] 

580.50 581.57 A: um 

581.75 582.76 A: well 

584.48 589.45 A: i don't i thought we went to i thought we have gone over ten minutes so 

588.92 594.23 B: well it's supposed to beep i i'm not looking at a clock right now so i don't know
