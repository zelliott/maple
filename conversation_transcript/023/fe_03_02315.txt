0.64 2.46 B: hi my name's juliet 

1.86 4.43 A: [noise] hi my name is dee 

4.32 6.94 B: (( dee hi nice to meet you )) 

4.84 6.21 A: mhm 

6.49 7.93 A: (( nice to meet you too )) 

7.89 10.31 B: i guess the topic is illness 

8.01 8.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

10.08 16.80 A: mhm um i'm guessing it's uh minor illnesses 'cause they said it's only about the seasons 

16.82 22.24 B: yeah well there's one that i heard about that um people get in the wintertime 

22.29 26.48 B: and it's because they don't have enough exposure to sunlight 

26.67 29.68 B: so it's kind of like it causes depression 

30.26 38.80 B: which makes you which makes you susceptible to colds and things like that but that's the only one i've heard about when the seasons change 

30.27 31.15 A: oh 

39.26 44.28 A: um i was thinking like when the weather gets cold people get colds and flus and um 

44.51 47.28 A: i guess in the springtime allergies and such 

47.30 48.66 A: stuff like that [laughter] 

48.33 58.26 B: that's true yeah i know my dad always got allergies in the springtime and it and the symptoms were the same as a cold like runny nose and red itchy eyes 

58.70 64.35 B: but i don't know i don't know if that's an illness but either way [laughter] it still feels like one 

62.37 63.59 A: mhm 

63.78 65.35 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

65.47 71.86 B: um they also said something about it's um a cold lasts seven days if you don't go to the doctor 

72.96 74.68 B: did you hear them say that 

74.48 77.79 A: yeah i heard something about like seven seven days 

78.33 87.36 A: i think they were talking about the allergies then 'cause i know for a col- e- like they confuse the allergies with a cold and then if you have it for more than seven days it's not a cold then 

78.64 79.85 B: (( yeah )) 

87.44 89.16 B: okay then it's an allergy 

88.73 89.84 A: right 

89.58 90.58 B: okay 

90.86 102.96 B: i don't know i've also i had a friend who um got severe allergies from the season you know pollen and things like that outside and also from cat hair and stuff indoors 

103.03 104.50 B: and um 

104.90 114.60 B: i don't know i wonder w- if it's like just like having a cold where you just get groggy and you can't go to work and things like that 'cause his were pretty severe 

115.13 119.16 B: but i've never knock on wood had to deal with anything like that 

118.91 126.96 A: mhm oh well my um i actually have allergies my doctor said that like those people for se- severe cases they can get um 

127.09 134.60 A: allergy shots in the summer or like whenever and you know um desensitize them to those to the pollen or whatever they're allergic to 

134.56 137.76 B: mhm oh wow have you ever taken claratyne 

137.80 141.97 A: um that's the one thing i haven't taken before [laughter] 

141.70 144.96 B: really that's the one i see on commercials all the time 

144.55 145.56 A: right 

145.57 150.40 B: but i don't know some of them might make you oh i don't know do you get the allergy shots 

150.33 159.41 A: no i don't um i i was on allegra for a little bit and i'm now on claranex for a little bit um well just 

154.82 156.24 B: [noise] oh 

158.41 160.56 B: okay i've heard of both of those 

160.02 162.85 A: yeah we're just rotating drugs right now [laughter] [mn] 

161.37 165.95 B: [mn] oh [laughter] fun do those make you tired 

165.89 173.37 A: um yeah actually a li- uh a little so i don't i'm beginning to think it's a cold or something 'cause none of the medications work mhm 

173.84 174.73 B: huh 

174.88 180.47 B: 'cause i know my friend had he was tak- like i said claratyne and we were all in a wedding 

180.36 191.15 B: and he was sneezing and runny nose red eyes 'cause it was the cat in the house and also it was springtime but he wouldn't take any medication 'cause it made him too sleepy 

191.14 196.44 B: and he was in the wedding so basically he just had the most miserable day ever 

197.19 198.73 A: yeah um 

198.16 199.73 B: (( so i i )) 

198.91 209.83 A: i don't i heard that claratyne works very well it just i for some reason my doctor doesn't believe it or something every time i go yeah she's always like no try this this is new on the market so i get i think i 

200.66 203.23 B: (( [mn] )) 

205.13 206.47 B: oh really 

209.27 216.58 B: uh-huh well i wonder if ca- if let's say for example if you wanted to try it would you be able to or do you need her permission 

217.05 225.02 A: could yeah i think i could try it without her permission it's just it's weird because i'm sitting there and i don't want to contradict her 'cause she's the doctor yeah 

218.94 219.71 B: mhm 

224.45 237.32 B: oh of cour- right 'cause she you know she's gone to medical school but i used to work in a doctor's office and they would have they would promote certain brands of medication based on 

237.40 243.46 B: you know who was selling to them and what type of um benefits they got like commission 

242.94 244.17 A: (( mhm right )) 

243.54 252.69 B: they got from that so it might just be something as simple as you know the people that are supplying her with medication only promote certain brands 

252.74 253.66 A: right 

254.35 257.08 B: but still [laughter] i wouldn't want to offend her 

255.46 256.50 A: i i i 

256.69 263.35 A: i know i just don't know how to even pre every time i go i'm like yeah i heard that claratyne was good and she's like oh how 'bout this one 

262.85 272.81 B: [laughter] no really i've heard claratyne it's really good [laughter] that's funny now thankfully i i don't have to deal with that 

264.34 265.21 A: yeah 

266.91 268.31 A: (( [laughter] yeah mhm )) 

272.64 279.75 B: but um i know that the one i like i said it's not an illness but it's kind of like depression where you get 

279.89 281.88 B: really um 

282.10 288.47 B: kind of you know you're in a bar and susceptible to colds is when you're not exposed to sunlight 

289.43 301.79 B: but um that's fixable by just either going to i know it sounds cheating but going to the tanning salon 'cause you're exposed to the u._v. rays for short periods of time it can actually enhance your mood 

298.03 299.01 A: yeah 

302.30 306.42 A: oh i didn't know that i just thought sunlight but i never thought about that tanning booth 

302.47 303.47 B: (( i don't know )) 

306.32 317.64 B: yeah because it has the same type of rays and they actually sell a product you can keep in your office at work or at home it's a it's a little panel 

317.55 327.32 B: that lights it emits u._v. rays and you can use it for you know ten minutes a day and it actually it helps um avoid winter depression 

327.79 329.20 A: (( oh how )) 

328.61 330.93 B: i don't i don't isn't that strange 

330.30 331.72 A: yeah 

331.11 334.23 B: (( [laughter] i don't know if it gives you a tan though )) 

334.27 336.29 B: but either way 

335.93 340.99 A: it probably will 'cause i think its um that's what causes the skin to change colors 

340.76 342.07 B: mhm 

341.43 342.71 A: so wow 

342.62 351.90 B: yeah but i think if your mood is good that you're not as susceptible to illnesses at least that's what i believe 

352.50 354.14 A: yeah i think so too 

354.50 359.10 A: like we are happier like you know how they're like laughter is the best medicine 

358.96 360.45 B: that's what i've heard 

359.88 361.03 A: yeah 

360.57 373.75 B: i wonder why i wonder if it's a muscular thing 'cause you're contracting your muscles [laughter] i i took a class in um kinesiology and it was about muscles and one of the first things they talked about was laughter 

364.57 366.07 A: [laughter] 

369.42 370.25 A: mhm 

373.73 380.85 B: and how it it can benefit you know your muscles [laughter] and your mood so i don't i don't know if that has anything to do with 

376.95 378.00 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

380.87 383.05 B: you know if it's just 

381.56 382.84 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

383.12 387.18 B: i don't know smiling or if it's your muscles working makes you feel better 

386.73 391.26 A: yeah have you ever heard like frowning takes more muscles than smiling [laughter] 

390.99 394.21 B: really i've never heard that 

391.63 392.88 A: yeah it's like 

393.10 396.17 A: forty muscles if you frown or something and like 

396.19 398.28 A: eight to smile i don't know yeah 

398.24 410.64 B: that's funny because what i kind of believe it 'cause when you frown you have to furrow your brow and you know scrunch up your nose and then keep your mouth kind of tight when you smile i 

410.66 415.66 B: i'm picturing just you know your cheeks and your eyebrows 

416.86 421.02 B: i don't know [laughter] that's a good one though 

418.11 418.94 A: [laughter] 

421.44 425.91 A: do you remember any um any of the the uh other stuff we were supposed to talk about 

426.59 427.60 B: um 

426.80 428.92 A: i completely forgot 

428.65 440.85 B: well i c- i wrote i kind of just quickly wrote down a note it just said seasonal change cold lasts seven days if you don't go to something about the doctor and and that was it 

440.56 442.37 A: oh okay [laughter] 

441.70 445.53 B: but i don't know if i had a cold i rarely ever go to the doctor 

445.20 446.61 A: yeah 

446.12 452.47 B: i just kind of wait it out um you know luckily i haven't actually been sick in a long time 

453.08 454.17 B: so 

454.45 455.59 B: i don't know 

455.80 457.43 B: maybe that's a good thing 

457.52 458.97 A: (( wow yeah [laughter] )) 

458.44 460.92 B: not seeing the doctor can keep you healthy 

460.65 461.32 A: (( [laughter] )) 

462.55 467.43 B: i think the last time i went to the doctor was in november but that was to- unrelated to 

467.61 471.26 B: that was just like i i ate something that made me sick 

471.19 473.67 A: (( oh sort of like food poisoning )) 

472.23 476.02 B: yeah yeah something like that and it i 

476.19 482.43 B: i had thought of like three places i had been that day that i got sick and i like refused to go back 

481.91 482.93 A: [laughter] 

482.28 491.93 B: [laughter] and they they're good places it's like you know like a supermarket deli that i really like i won't go there anymore [laughter] i was i was i couldn't go to work for two days 

488.20 489.23 A: [laughter] 

492.01 501.01 B: so and when i went by the time i was able to get an appointment with the doctor you know he interviewed me and you know checked me out and he said basically now 

501.22 504.62 B: you know you're you're going to be fine just have seven up 

504.69 506.64 B: 'cause i couldn't really eat till 

506.08 507.46 A: (( oh okay )) 

506.75 516.96 B: that second day i'm like well i came all the way out here [laughter] we've spent half an hour of filling out forms in your office and you tell me to have seven up 

510.03 510.93 A: [laughter] 

516.13 518.78 A: yeah i know that feeling 

517.60 523.72 B: so [laughter] that's why i don't like going to the doctor even if i am sick i always think that 

523.93 526.41 B: your body can heal itself 

526.18 527.70 A: yeah 

527.48 528.81 B: to some extent 

528.70 532.17 A: yeah i just like the um like i had the flu this winter 

532.20 542.42 A: i i thought it was a cold and so i kept on taking cold medication finally i went to the doctors and so i don't like sickness is that you know sort of is like a cold but really isn't 

540.11 540.73 B: (( yeah )) 

542.33 546.80 B: yeah how did how did you decide to go to the doctor 

543.33 544.28 A: yeah 

546.71 557.38 A: um i don't it was just not going away and um one night i couldn't take it anymore i was coughing and i couldn't sleep so the next stage was the hospital and um 

557.61 566.82 A: sat there for a long time and the doctor goes um you have the flu just there's nothing i can do so why don't you go home [laughter] 

559.10 560.20 B: mhm 

563.06 563.90 B: oh 

566.45 571.03 B: go home and go to sleep yeah was it is it contagious do you think 

567.82 569.09 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

570.06 581.15 A: um i don't think it well i guess other people get it too so um my friends they they sort of got sick after me [laughter] but i don't think i gave it to them though 

578.78 586.67 B: [laughter] yeah it could have been yeah 'cause i went to work and i after i'd gotten better 

586.61 599.89 B: and i was talking i work with students and i one of the girls said oh you know my stomach was hurting really bad and i thought gosh i wonder if i got it from her and not the place where i'd eaten so i was just not sure 

597.75 598.82 A: (( mhm mhm ))
