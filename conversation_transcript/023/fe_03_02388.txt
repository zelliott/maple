10.18 11.81 A: are we supposed to start 

11.63 13.31 B: i i don't know 

13.42 16.74 B: they said they haven't asked us a question yet 

16.50 22.98 A: well i think the question was about what do we think is worse 

16.79 17.71 B: (( have they )) 

23.05 26.45 A: (( gossiping or um )) 

25.25 26.91 B: (( oh well )) 

27.53 33.79 B: obviously i i feel it's smoking because it's detrimental to your physical health 

34.17 40.54 B: and so many people have died from it so i don't know that many people have died from the other things what do you think 

39.61 40.52 A: (( that's a )) 

40.74 43.04 A: (( that's a good point um )) 

43.74 51.83 A: yeah i might i might agree with that only because smoking not only affects yourself but it also affects the people around you 

52.82 55.17 B: that's what they say [laughter] 

55.64 59.79 A: yeah i would believe it i mean i don't want to go to places where people are smoking 

61.14 62.94 B: (( you don't )) 

62.56 64.14 A: no i 

64.46 66.00 A: i 

66.23 67.27 A: (( i )) 

66.34 73.17 B: ouch ouch pardon me i just stepped down on a piece of glass on the floor um oh god it's bleeding 

73.26 74.69 B: i'm sorry 

74.71 78.75 B: i'm sorry i'm walking i'm in my i'm packing you know and i'm in 

74.93 76.06 A: that's okay 

78.83 80.10 B: (( i'm in the ah )) 

80.55 85.29 B: the bedroom without any shoes on so i just stepped on a piece of glass 

85.47 92.10 B: um i didn't mean to be rude well smoking and you don't go to places that ah have smokers 

91.93 93.04 A: no 

92.17 94.46 B: well what do you think of the ah 

95.13 97.07 B: idea of ah 

97.13 106.04 B: new york coming down on ah bars and restaurants saying no smoking allowed i mean that's a tourist place 

103.96 104.97 A: i think 

106.19 119.34 A: it maybe it's a tourist place but i think it's a great idea i think that you don't need smoking in the buildings to have a good time and setting designated smoking areas is appropriate as long as 

119.61 123.78 A: they're outside and not in the middle of the traffic flow 

124.29 133.13 B: well when when they have designated ah smoking places um they're off to the side 

133.06 144.34 B: um and they're smaller than the main area that's been my experience anyway but as i understand it new york ah mayor has decided that 

144.38 155.26 B: no smoking is allowed and when visitors come to the city from other cities and other countries and they smoke and ah when you go to a 

155.86 164.22 B: restaurant or a bar you generally smoke i mean this is only very very recently i think 

164.52 166.61 B: that um 

168.25 176.83 B: people are so aware they've known all along that smoking is harmful to the health but now you know you're almost 

177.91 182.82 B: crucified [laughter] by people they come up to you and attack you 

179.49 180.55 A: (( yeah that's )) 

182.86 192.35 B: practically on the street you know you know i mean it it that you know that kind of attitude to me is infringing on a person's rights 

185.29 186.62 A: that's true 

192.47 201.65 B: you know because they're not dumb they can read a label they know that ah that the tobacco company lied ah 

201.54 202.85 A: (( or mislead )) 

202.07 204.33 B: seven people in front of a 

204.40 206.43 B: congress [laughter] you know they're telling them 

205.49 208.39 A: (( they mislead they didn't lie )) 

207.74 210.00 B: they did what they mislead 

209.69 212.57 A: (( they mislead they didn't lie )) 

212.52 216.47 B: they lied they said nicotine wasn't h- wasn't harmful 

217.21 221.41 B: that's what they said they said nicotine was not harmful 

222.56 223.30 B: [sigh] 

222.62 225.94 A: (( well yeah that would be false [laughter] but what about my rights )) 

226.19 229.62 B: yeah mhm seven of them 

230.03 233.72 B: so you know but but but i think i think it is a 

233.79 234.57 B: ah 

234.64 237.73 B: i think it infringes on a person's rights 

237.98 238.92 B: (( ah )) 

238.84 242.53 A: (( to be smoke free but in a bar then all of a sudden if it is if it's not a smoke free )) 

242.13 245.59 B: you don't have to be in place where a person is smoking 

246.18 255.28 A: (( environment then i'm subjected to all the people around me who are smoking and i and i think that they have a they have the right to do that and i don't object to designated areas but to say )) 

255.78 257.16 A: (( no smoking )) 

256.01 264.14 B: right and most people do smoke in bars that you know that's my point about about new york because ah 

265.57 269.58 B: i i mean it's amazing to me that ah 

269.70 271.80 B: that it went through 

272.01 282.76 B: because it's you know a tourist place th- they don't have the same restrictions the people that come into new york from abroad or you know other ah states 

283.42 290.81 B: th- they don't have th- no smoking restriction they wanna have a meal afterwards if they're smokers and light up 

290.89 295.12 B: or have a drink ah smoke with some beer or whatever 

294.86 296.81 A: (( at all )) 

296.15 297.91 B: (( yeah well )) 

301.54 302.89 B: (( i )) 

305.04 306.17 B: (( oh )) 

305.92 314.78 A: but do you think those designated areas are effective because even if it is a designated area the whole bar smells like smoke 

314.72 316.47 B: really 

315.84 325.88 A: yeah yeah i i don't think it's effective enough just to say one room is a smoking room 'cause that smoke is just going to get all over the place 

327.04 328.22 B: (( ah huh )) 

328.27 329.59 B: well 

329.21 335.71 A: and it's also not fair to the bar tender and to the wait staff who have to be 

336.94 341.02 A: um in the presence of all the smoke 

341.16 343.29 A: tw- you know eight hours a day 

344.60 355.72 A: and they're they're kind of stuck you know they wanna serve and they wanna help everyone but they're going to end up getting all that smoke second hand that they wouldn't get otherwise 

356.38 358.80 B: yeah that's true 

360.51 364.92 A: and california is currently a smoke free for clubs and restaurants 

365.79 369.02 A: and they've been that way for several years now 

369.83 375.71 A: and every time i i go there i love it i mean it's just nice not to smell like smoke at the end of the night 

376.93 381.67 B: y- y- y- you were not a smoker when you were smelling like smoke 

381.60 382.38 A: no 

382.29 388.89 A: ah when i go to clubs in dallas and oh arizona y- you leave and you're 

388.73 401.86 A: you smell like smoke and you never smoked i mean it's just it's just the smoke is so strong and especially in a club environment that it just gets into your clothes and your hair and you can't avoid it 

401.97 403.75 B: (( mhm )) 

404.02 406.00 A: but then california with 

406.12 409.06 A: with their laws no smoking in doors 

409.25 413.25 A: you go in you come out and you smell exactly the same and that's nice 

416.51 418.31 A: and i would prefer that so 

418.32 419.68 A: as far as 

419.88 426.46 A: people smoking they can smoke all they want as long as they don't infringe on my right to have 

426.74 429.37 A: a to have fresh clean air 

431.87 434.29 B: and where do you find fresh clean air 

434.36 437.60 A: well besides california i don't know 

436.77 441.06 B: oh don't be funny [laughter] don't be funny i lived out there 

441.50 445.14 B: [laughter] that's not exactly fresh clean air 

445.15 451.45 B: you get up and get ready to go to the beach and by the time you got there in half an hour it'd be 

452.12 453.50 B: fogged in 

453.98 457.32 B: [laughter] it's not exactly clean air 

455.06 456.73 A: well i'm not 

456.98 459.71 A: i'm not counting the smog that's a different issue 

459.83 461.68 A: we're talking about smoking 

461.90 469.42 B: i know but you were talking about fresh clean air yeah then you were saying you know california has fresh clean air i don't 

464.81 465.83 A: yeah 

470.60 479.06 B: know how they can lay claim to that you know i mean when you look out and look over the city you know there's all this 

473.35 475.45 A: [laughter] 

479.17 484.23 B: fog and things and industry what little they have 

484.38 486.15 A: yeah that 

484.69 491.28 B: i don't think california is a maybe another another place in the states but i wouldn't call california 

491.98 493.26 B: that ah that 

493.37 494.59 B: free 

494.64 495.76 B: of ah

498.25 499.07 B: or 

500.39 504.16 A: yeah i guess i- i'll concede that's that's that's true 

506.21 510.24 A: so what do you think about gossip in the workplace i think that was one of the other topics 

509.05 512.85 B: are we supposed to talk about more than one subject 

512.53 515.53 A: well i i don't know what else to say about smoking 

515.22 519.54 B: oh y- yeah i'm kind of pooped out about smoking too um 

520.22 522.56 B: gossip in the work place well 

522.57 527.81 B: um i have not worked for a number of years and ah 

529.70 531.74 B: at the time

566.52 570.15 B: case against them you know if i'm going to be judgmental
