18.47 22.11 A: um a friend on the internet was doing it and so i 

21.84 23.70 B: yeah it's great 

22.75 24.54 A: got involved yes 

23.80 33.97 B: all right so the topic is they wanna know that as the seasons change if peo- when people get sick and what they do and all that right

34.95 36.13 B: yeah 

36.48 42.33 B: i know [laughter] and then the second one was i remember they said a cold lasts 

42.21 52.87 B: seven days if you go to the doctor and a week if you don't meaning to me that like you can't do anything if you go to the doctor it's not gonna help right

56.01 59.55 B: i know exactly so it's like a play on words 

57.09 58.33 A: yeah so 

59.21 60.38 A: yeah 

59.88 68.63 B: because there's really nothing to do for a cold i mean you know when you have a cold i mean you really you know you could take medication at some of the drug stores 

67.41 75.58 A: mm like just to sub- subside the uh the problem but you can't really cure it because its not its not a curable thing you just wait it out really

129.85 135.12 A: well yeah it's like well my seasons don't really change round here but i guess in um 

135.28 140.12 A: in uh certain like like in august in spring or fall it uh 

140.04 152.95 A: the the pollen comes so people have more allergies like i know i get allergies for um i'm allergic to things so um that makes me sick and i get colds from that but um i don't know if the seasons don't change i don't know if 

146.20 147.48 B: (( mhm yeah ))

197.85 207.02 B: definitely definitely definitely and they also say that if you're um like you know if you're very stressed right it could bring on um 

207.04 211.10 B: you know you could bring on sickness i mean your resistance is down 

209.42 213.70 A: yeah that's that's that's what i thought happened to me recently actually i um 

212.76 214.29 B: (( yeah yeah [mn] )) 

213.55 222.14 A: i'd been sick for a while and was trying to figure out what it was and i knew my a friend of mine had felt the same way we felt both felt nauseous we both felt like we had colds 

221.99 232.17 A: and everything you know was going wrong and she went to the doctors and i didn't and he told her it was probably just stress and we had both going through the same stuff because our finals were finished the end of our college career 

230.43 233.11 B: (( oh sure sure )) 

232.19 234.77 A: that we all started to get sick

251.46 252.56 A: yeah 

252.00 258.35 B: i'm you know i've been to florida i'd say about fifteen to twenty times in my life 

257.99 258.90 A: oh

265.98 275.60 B: so you know it's great it really is and um so you're graduating that's wonderful that's great and what what kind of course did you study what what 

272.07 272.92 A: yes 

275.01 276.58 A: um graphic design 

276.47 280.05 B: (( wow very impressive )) 

277.90 279.22 A: so all done 

279.70 285.06 A: yeah i'm just training i could get si- get sick 'cause i i always seem to get sick right 

284.55 286.08 B: (( i know )) 

285.11 291.28 A: when i i need to get things done it must be subconscious or what but somethings happens and 

289.16 290.26 B: that's right 

290.48 296.91 B: i know that's right because we have to speak more about the sick topic because [laughter] well i know it's been 

294.09 295.32 A: yeah 

296.80 305.65 B: you know around here also people get the flu a lot and um i was lucky 'cause i got the flu shots so once you get the flu shot most of the time you don't get the flu mhm 

305.07 308.47 A: yeah i l- like where i where i work oh i work at um 

308.60 315.18 A: they they give out a flu shot sometimes like i dunno they they give it they give it out and all like the um 

315.12 327.48 A: the old elderly people come and there'll be lines and lines of people just getting the flu shot and i'm so scared to do that because they say that sometimes you ca- you can actually contract the flu and you can get worse your immune well 

319.53 320.61 B: [laughter] i know 

325.00 330.73 B: yes i do know yes i do know people who do get the flu shot and did get the flu 

330.75 342.69 B: but i've been very lucky 'cause i i had the flu many years ago really bad and i had it it was so bad i couldn't go out for like eight days and then i said all right i'm gonna get the flu shot and then from then on i've never gotten the flu 

342.14 345.18 A: that's good yeah probably builds a tolerance for your system 

345.24 351.62 A: and yeah i don- i don't know i try not to go into the doctors that much because a lot of the time you know you'll you can visit you don't really need to 

350.87 351.93 B: (( yeah of course )) 

351.96 363.45 B: and plus the fact is where i work we have the oxford plan where you have to get your referral and all that to go to the doctor and it's such a pain just to you know you just say to yourself well maybe i could treat it myself at home 

357.53 359.23 A: (( oh yeah )) 

363.42 369.11 B: [laughter] you know 'cause uh and you can't you can't forget this referral to go to this one and that one 

368.01 370.13 A: yeah those insurances are a pain 

369.39 371.90 B: oh it's terrible in fact that 

370.87 381.87 A: yeah that's how mine was actually it's getting better now i had uh h._m._o. and p._p._o. it was supposedly dependant of the doctor board but then it switched over just to p._p._o. so i don't have to get a referral anymore but 

375.36 376.48 B: oh yeah 

377.85 379.06 B: (( oh right )) 

381.49 383.00 B: oh that's great 

381.89 388.70 A: i don't know i i ha have a whole new plan like ch- all these new doctors whose treatments i i haven't really cho- chosen any new doctors yet so 

387.77 395.75 B: yeah yeah i mean it's i like the good old days when you could just go to the doctor and the insurance you know before the p._p._o.s and the h._m._o.s 

394.89 407.29 A: yeah and they don't wanna give you this test because it's too expensive and you have to wait it out and try this and this and this first before it's just a pain so okay if i'm gonna go to the doctors and you're not gonna give me medicine anyway what's the point in going if you tell me i have a cold you know 

397.49 398.77 B: right 

401.72 402.91 B: (( that's right )) 

406.39 408.30 B: (( [laughter] that's right that's )) 

407.38 415.32 A: waste most of my afternoon waiting um in a waiting room for you to tell me oh yeah you've a cold by the way huh drink some soup you know 

413.41 414.44 B: (( right i know )) 

414.95 419.74 B: yeah 'cause when the lady you know who talks to you beforehand it's a recording i assume she says 

419.69 431.28 B: and it says about the doctor and you go for one week and you have a cold and if you don't go you have a cold and it was just funny 'cause i laughed i said well obviously the doctor doesn't do much 

426.06 427.02 A: yeah 

431.17 432.17 A: yeah 

431.27 443.20 B: but you know it's true people do get a b- um ill and they get upset and they get um the change of seasons i think affect people a lot and also as you said the allergies 'cause i have allergies too 

439.14 440.17 A: mhm 

442.39 444.12 A: mhm me too yeah 

443.67 446.89 B: i have a cat imagine i'm allergic to my cat 

445.88 449.01 A: me too i hav- i have three cats and i'm allergic 

448.80 450.37 B: (( me too yeah )) 

449.43 453.11 A: only ob i'm only allergic to to one of them 

453.22 458.02 A: i was allergic to i'm allergic to most cats but it's funny i have a real tolerance to these cats 

457.39 459.01 B: yeah 

458.38 470.80 A: i i'm not i can put my face in his fur and i'm not allergic and i don't get a cold from him but when my i had one cat uh my mother's cat i'm allergic to that cat i don't know why i don't know what the difference is but maybe it's his fur 

462.46 463.71 B: wow 

465.70 466.83 B: yeah 

469.26 471.63 B: does it have long hair different 

470.84 477.54 A: it doesn't have long hair but it's got finer hair and i get the worst allergies and like cold in my life it's horrible 

473.11 474.26 B: (( finer hair )) 

477.14 490.90 B: yeah i have a cat too and she's almost a year old and she's a tabby and she's grey and white and she's beautiful but i am allergic so i take claratyne and things like that but some days i'm okay but then other days like it could kill me you know and she's really 

485.53 486.47 A: yeah 

488.49 489.70 A: yeah 

490.69 497.67 B: not that fur i mean she's furry she just doesn't have long hair she's just a typical cat you know um typical tabby cat 

497.02 498.09 A: mhm 

497.45 506.15 B: but i love cats oh i'm so glad oh that's isn't that ni- and it's funny i just subscribed to it's called cat fancy magazine
