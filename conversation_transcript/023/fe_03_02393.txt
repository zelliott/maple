336.40 337.42 A: mhm 

336.47 346.35 B: you know and i think that's how life is lived is is just every day it's a it's a choice for this or choice for that and if you stop and think about how many choices you have to make you know

463.85 468.02 B: oh really oh yeah but um okay 

468.34 473.62 B: alcohol we've covered that a little bit but out of all that we've covered the gossip 

472.43 474.83 A: oh and there was exercising too 

474.46 480.23 B: yeah i mean all these things are you know what you know what is the worst 

477.01 477.84 A: see 

479.37 482.00 A: that's kind of weird with the with the exercising 

482.80 486.49 A: most people wouldn't think exercising is a bad thing 

486.16 488.67 B: no a lack of lack of exercise 

488.02 491.03 A: lack of exercise was it lack of exercising 

489.85 495.67 B: i think so i think so it wasn't over- it was not over exercising it was lack of 

496.40 508.36 B: yeah i think that's pretty bad too especially if you're an over eater and you just gobble and gobble and just hang around and let the fat roll and then gossip about [laughter] somebody and drink your booze [laughter] no and smoke 

505.14 506.27 A: [laughter] 

507.74 509.30 A: exactly 

508.48 519.47 B: smoking too okay smoking was it was just what did you feel was was one of the worst and for me it was the gossiping i usually allow people to do be who they are and whatever and 

518.42 519.30 A: yeah 

519.57 530.60 B: and and try to draw the line with gossip if i do something or share information y- i don't know there's a there's a fine line between sharing information and gossiping 

530.44 533.41 A: yeah yeah true 

533.43 535.21 A: when it's gossiping it's 

536.87 539.72 A: one person that's being gossiped about 

536.89 537.65 B: it 

540.13 540.92 A: (( is )) 

541.31 553.35 B: what i what i think though too is if people resort to that if people have to resort to saying something bad about somebody else all they're trying to do is make themselves look better 

554.20 560.63 A: but i don't think gossiping is necessarily that i think gossiping is just is you know 

561.44 563.41 A: basically it 

563.66 574.60 B: yeah true but it has to be it has to be based in some insecurity or for some reason to point a finger at somebody and say did y- did you hear about the latest about so and so 

574.57 576.59 A: only ends up getting 

577.14 580.88 A: off ah who's gossiping you know 

581.28 582.82 B: yeah 

582.22 583.29 A: (( and so ))

587.23 589.56 B: oh sure oh sure 

589.73 591.06 B: well then 

591.28 598.76 B: then actually some of the the the evening news stations that gossip because they don't always get their facts straight [laughter] 

598.10 599.09 A: yeah [laughter]
