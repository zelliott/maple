328.61 330.83 B: see i don't like beer i can't drink beer 

330.90 333.25 A: really [mn] 

331.80 332.74 B: yeah 

333.45 339.79 A: i i got there there's a guy that lives in my ah apartment that is from britain and he ah 

339.82 351.13 A: he doesn't drink american beer because it's like not thick enough for him [laughter] like gui- guinness is kind of like the low end of what he drinks but he brought some stout over 

344.83 345.75 B: [laughter] 

348.82 350.07 B: oh my god 

351.14 363.93 A: with him and it's like it's like sand or it's just the thickest crap ever it's i i don't understand how you can drink more than a glass of it but yeah he's not a big beer fan either 

355.36 356.66 B: [laughter] 

357.63 358.70 B: [laughter] 

365.43 370.50 A: i don't know being like water though it's great on like a summer day or whatever just to

377.38 378.74 A: yeah it's 

377.96 379.03 B: and that's like 

379.11 382.28 B: just defeats the point of drinking really 

381.79 383.35 A: (( yeah )) 

382.62 383.78 B: you think 

383.59 386.87 A: yeah i i mean yeah last summer it was just 

387.24 388.97 A: it was like i 

389.03 393.37 A: had no job for about two weeks and me and my friend just went on a binge 

393.21 406.74 A: and it was like at the end of that you we could probably drink like cases and cases of beer a day and be you know pretty like tipsy or whatever but you still don't get drunk it's li- it's ridiculous it just fills your stomach up 

401.34 402.34 B: yeah 

404.69 408.12 B: right and it's not a good drunk either it's kind of like 

408.40 409.51 B: sluggish 

408.66 409.85 A: yeah it's 

409.94 414.92 A: yeah if you wanna get like actually drunk you've got to go with liquor i don't know 

414.26 415.28 B: yeah 

415.66 422.64 A: and that's what yeah you like see i quit smok- or i tried to quit smoking about four or five months ago 

422.86 431.42 A: and it's like yeah you know no problem when you're sober but when you're drunk you've got to have a smoke it's like it's so necessary [mn] 

428.59 429.69 B: yeah 

431.01 440.01 B: right yeah that's what happened to me like i like i turned twenty one last year and i quit smoking for three months beforehand then i turned twenty one and it was all downhill 

440.00 440.91 A: yeah 

440.16 442.74 B: i started smoking again it was really bad 

442.93 451.54 A: yeah that's what i yeah i'm only twenty but so like with ah british friend he's twenty one so you know we'll go to the bars together or whatever 

451.48 462.67 A: and it's just [mn] yeah it's no good i mean like bars are fun but [laughter] it's such a waste of money like just go buy a fifth of liquor and 

462.10 463.30 B: right 

462.70 466.55 A: have a have a good night for a third of the price you know

471.09 472.08 A: yeah 

473.60 476.01 A: yeah yeah exactly that's 

474.91 476.01 B: much cheaper 

476.41 484.24 A: yeah just drink drink in your drink at your place whatever and then go out and don't buy drinks when you're out

499.12 500.44 B: [laughter] 

500.64 512.77 A: he like he didn't go into the club i don't think but the club was thirty five blocks from our hotel and he somehow when we got back he was there and he had no idea how he'd gotten back [mn] [laughter] that's
