325.06 336.14 A: very well and nice but that's not for me i i know this with so many people and the good thing about like the twelve star programs is that it introduces faith 

336.36 345.37 A: to somebody or spirituality or whatever it is to somebody who has always been kind of afraid of that in a way that they can deal with it

371.04 374.51 A: but i don't believe in the whole i'm sick for the rest of my life thing 

374.87 377.05 A: that's just me but i don't 

376.06 377.74 B: yeah
