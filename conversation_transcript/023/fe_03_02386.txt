0.14 1.32 A: katie 

1.44 3.24 B: hi it's gabe 

3.69 4.52 A: (( hi )) 

4.44 5.36 B: hi 

6.48 8.73 A: (( okay so what do you think [laughter] )) 

7.93 12.67 B: this is the first time i've ever i've doing this so maybe it's something i'd be 

11.71 13.74 A: well this is my first time too 

13.65 14.81 B: okay 

14.98 16.09 B: (( so )) 

15.20 16.99 A: (( what do you think is worse [laughter] )) 

17.01 25.23 B: i think it's about we have to decide what's worse smoking drinking or actually i haven't heard the last of it so it would be 

24.39 29.15 A: it's smoking drinking gossiping over eating and exercising 

30.10 39.42 B: i think ah gossiping is definitely very bad because ah it creates er impressions of other people that 

39.26 47.39 B: will ah last for a long time but um other things are bad as well what do you think 

46.78 53.02 A: i think the same thing because the other ones affect you personally but gossiping affects the other person too 

53.19 54.48 B: yeah 

53.95 55.95 A: it's more harmful to other people 

55.87 58.49 B: yeah that's true absolutely 

58.19 59.46 A: yeah 

58.93 60.87 B: because it affects ah 

61.11 69.02 B: oh the image of that ah people have about their character so basically it's a character assassination no 

68.53 73.64 A: yes yeah and it affects other people besides just the person you're gossiping about 

73.26 74.72 B: exactly 

75.12 76.10 B: so 

75.24 77.96 A: so of the other ones what do you think's the second 

78.02 79.17 A: worst 

78.60 81.12 B: dr- oh the second worse 

80.98 82.35 A: yeah 

81.87 82.75 B: (( ah )) 

82.96 84.69 B: (( maybe drug use )) 

84.84 86.45 B: is really bad 

86.25 87.73 A: yeah the alcohol 

87.59 90.03 B: (( alc- alcohol is bad too )) 

90.12 94.43 B: i mean i think it's basically about ah how people use it like 

94.21 105.65 B: if they use it very lightly and very in- infre- infrequently then obviously it's not that bad but if somebody is an alcoholic or a drug addict then it's 

105.69 107.75 B: it's another problem altogether 

107.12 118.83 A: yeah i guess smoking and alcohol use could also affect other people by like if you were drinking too much it affects your family or and smoking affects other people second hand affects other people too 

114.27 117.74 B: yeah and second hand smoke yeah and second hand 

118.61 121.98 B: yeah second hand smoking is really bad too 

121.90 125.40 A: yeah so i still think gossiping is the worst though 

125.35 134.73 B: gossiping is horrible because it actually actually destroys other people but the person who is a gossip he or she is being destroyed by 

134.74 139.06 B: by by the actions that he or she takes because ah 

138.97 152.10 B: basically if you gossip then it means you you don't have any other things to do in other words you are probably a boring person no if somebody's not not you but i'm talking about somebody [laughter] who's gossiping 

147.75 148.66 A: (( yeah )) 

150.57 151.82 A: [laughter] 

152.44 153.58 B: so 

154.40 163.89 B: but here i mean i'm i'm talking from new york ah in new york they basically banned ah smoking in all restaurants and all that stuff so 

163.78 166.92 A: yeah us too for the most part of it in seattle 

166.99 168.41 B: yeah 

167.79 172.30 A: yeah i don't think the ah the over eating one's that bad do you 

172.83 177.48 B: over eating um yeah because at least you enjoy it and you don't 

177.59 179.40 B: you don't hurt others 

179.84 184.28 A: yeah yeah and it's your own personal problem and not anybody else's 

182.28 195.03 B: it's your own personal problems exactly of course if somebody's extremely overweight it could be a problem for others because for example if they sit on a bus nobody can sit next to them but that's another problem [laughter] 

194.75 197.87 A: or like when you have to buy two seats on the airplane [laughter] 

197.17 200.56 B: yeah nowadays you have to buy two seats that's right 

200.35 204.59 A: and it used to be that you were a parent or something and it was like your child probably 

204.72 208.82 B: absolutely for example y- if your kid is overweight obviously 

208.86 221.44 B: you don't feel too good about yourself how come that you created a monster or something like that [laughter] you know [laughter] no i mean obviously i i i'm a little bit ironic but it has some truth in it 

214.83 216.75 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

219.63 220.42 A: [laughter] 

221.31 227.32 A: yeah and then ah the last one was ah not exercising enough i 

221.97 223.11 B: mhm 

226.98 229.27 B: not exercising enough 

229.38 230.71 A: think everybody 

230.98 241.74 B: that's related to overweight isn't it it's related to being overweight because ah obviously if you don't exercise too much then eventually you're going to be overweight 

233.22 234.32 A: yeah 

241.82 246.75 A: yeah i think the majority of americans don't really exercise enough though 

242.46 243.91 B: yeah and 

246.37 249.64 B: no but it's interesting because ah 

249.95 262.55 B: there is a culture of exercise in the united states and it's very strong so you would think that um most people are exercising but it's not true it's just the image or the perception of the whole thing 

262.37 265.45 A: yeah and then you get people who exercise too much 

265.57 271.94 B: that's true and then they look like i don't know schwarzenegger number two or something like that 

272.00 273.04 B: (( i don't know )) 

272.33 273.65 A: where are you from 

273.25 275.86 B: i'm from hungary originally 

275.30 276.85 A: oh okay 

276.18 280.06 B: but i've been living here for twelve years in new york city in brooklyn 

279.17 280.34 A: (( wow )) 

280.79 282.72 B: (( are you in seattle )) 

282.48 283.62 A: yes 

283.07 285.45 B: oh so i heard it correctly 

284.82 286.44 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

286.35 288.67 B: so i just um 

288.81 292.19 B: i just find it on the internet this program so that's why 

292.15 293.40 A: yeah me too 

292.34 294.32 B: i decided i'm going to do it 

294.58 295.83 B: so 

296.49 301.27 B: exercise let's talk about a topic otherwise they think that we don't want to talk about it 

299.83 300.65 A: (( [laughter] )) 

300.88 301.97 A: (( okay )) 

301.60 315.38 B: [laughter] i was like where was i okay so again to recap our conversation the number one is gossiping that's the worst thing one can do after that um drug abuse 

307.33 308.37 A: [laughter] 

311.33 312.10 A: yeah 

315.37 321.63 B: the third one is probably drinking the forth is ah 

319.10 320.22 A: yeah 

321.54 322.66 A: smoking 

322.60 329.50 B: smoking yeah smoking then being overweight and not exercising 

328.91 330.19 A: yeah 

329.70 336.60 B: yeah absolutely so which one do you think you are guilty of [laughter] if i can ask you [laughter] 

331.65 332.66 A: yeah 

335.65 338.31 A: (( [laughter] um )) 

338.66 341.30 A: probably a little bit of all of them [laughter] 

341.10 343.95 B: yeah well i 

342.75 344.62 A: i exercise a lot though 

344.61 347.85 B: used to smoke i don't smoke any more because it 

347.27 348.17 A: yeah 

347.99 356.23 B: my lungs couldn't take it and ah drinking not too much sometimes if i go out i drink a little bit 

350.04 351.04 A: yeah 

356.39 362.36 B: but exercise obviously n- not obviously but it's obvious for me that i'm not exercising too much at all 

362.87 370.45 B: so i don't think i'm overweight maybe i have a little stomach you know stomach is a little bit bigger th- 

368.39 369.68 A: [laughter] 

370.66 375.22 B: but it has the advantage that i don't fall you know when somebody [laughter] doesn't matter 

374.62 375.99 A: yeah 

375.27 378.07 B: so what else oh smoking no 

377.24 382.27 A: i think for me probably the alcohol one would be the most that i'm guilty of though 

381.99 383.36 B: yeah 

382.75 384.42 A: [laughter] 

383.57 386.15 B: are you on a campus or something 

385.83 389.36 A: yeah yeah i'm a college student [laughter] 

386.84 391.31 B: oh that's it if you're on a campus then it's a bum i guess 

391.09 392.86 A: yeah 

392.08 395.68 B: yeah because it's like a culture of drinking 

395.61 400.78 A: definitely definitely yeah i've been drinking since i was fifteen though so 

396.92 397.98 B: (( do you )) 

400.23 401.85 B: really fifteen 

401.14 402.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

402.10 403.58 B: holy mackerel 

403.52 404.55 A: (( yes )) 

403.80 413.96 B: well you know it's funny because i'm from eastern europe and eastern europeans are drinking like crazy but for some reason i'm not that ah i'm not into that although my cousins are 

414.04 418.93 B: drinking a little bit i mean a lot actually over there but it's another topic 

417.12 418.01 A: yeah 

418.97 424.83 B: so what else do we have to wait until they say it it's over or what's happening 

424.20 430.88 A: yeah they come on and they say that ah it's been ten minutes and then we're supposed give like review or comments about 

430.99 433.77 A: the talk i guess [laughter] i don't know 

432.19 433.33 B: (( uh-huh )) 

433.58 434.68 B: okay 

435.03 436.05 A: so 

435.34 439.64 B: [laughter] so have you heard it ah have you heard about it ah on the internet 

439.65 442.81 A: yeah i was linked just by somebody else 

441.40 446.53 B: hm me too i just found it today in craig's list 

446.75 449.39 A: yeah i need some money

454.72 456.02 A: yeah 

455.38 459.11 B: but i'm sure they're going to use it for good good purposes 

459.03 460.22 A: hope so 

460.21 463.77 B: (( [laughter] yeah so so ah )) 

461.34 462.69 A: yeah 

463.77 465.87 A: (( i don't know what to talk about [laughter] )) 

464.95 475.36 B: i know i mean could talk about other things but then maybe they want us you know they would say that we shouldn't talk about other things i don't know so probably we're going to be enlightened very soon 

475.71 478.39 A: yeah i think we're almost done so 

477.68 482.40 B: yeah so in any case ah i hope you're going to have a nice day 

482.09 482.87 A: (( you too ))

505.35 506.51 A: (( yeah )) 

505.92 512.00 B: but ah it's interesting if they can use it for a good purpose then i'm i'm happy about it 

512.20 513.36 A: (( mhm )) 

512.73 520.60 B: i would like to i can talk about politics or languages but that's another story probably they're going to call be about it too if they like this conversation 

520.97 524.11 B: because i had to indicate that speak another language so 

521.22 522.21 A: yeah 

524.44 527.30 B: maybe they're going to call me from hungary or something 

524.49 525.85 A: (( yeah that would be interesting )) 

527.20 528.11 A: [laughter] 

527.42 530.54 B: from a village to explain how they live there or i don't know 

530.34 531.98 A: yeah that'd be interesting 

530.66 531.48 B: [laughter] 

531.65 535.52 B: that would be fascinating [laughter] i'm just getting 

534.32 535.30 A: yeah 

535.83 540.53 B: okay so maybe we have to wait until they say it's over 

539.95 542.59 A: i think we have a couple more minutes [laughter] 

541.91 544.80 B: mm okay so let's fill it up 

544.78 546.59 A: (( i don't know what to talk about [laughter] )) 

546.20 549.52 B: so which which which university or college you going to 

549.46 550.99 A: i'm in seattle central 

550.64 558.88 B: oh okay i unfortunately i have no clue where th- wh- i went to brooklyn college because i live in brooklyn actually i'm in brooklyn now 

554.92 556.23 A: (( in seattle [laughter] )) 

558.90 560.18 A: oh cool 

559.80 563.26 B: which is ah a funny place isn't it 

562.66 564.00 A: yeah

569.64 570.79 A: yeah 

570.22 572.50 B: yeah so 

572.62 574.97 A: what else about the topic can we talk about 

574.80 584.71 B: smoking smoking other is there there is the price of ah cigarettes here in new york state so it's very very expensive 

584.20 586.82 A: yeah it's five dollars here for a pack 

586.47 591.37 B: five over here it's sometimes even six fifty can you imagine that's a lot of money 

589.46 599.11 A: wow see that affects people too because if you're poor and you have an addiction to smoking then you're spending your money on cigarettes and you're not spending it on food or your family 

594.86 595.93 B: that's true 

598.51 599.95 B: that's true i have a
