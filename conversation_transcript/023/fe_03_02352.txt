86.21 87.79 B: right um 

86.82 87.44 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

88.64 97.94 B: i agree smoking um also it seems to be a big big killer um among you know people causing disease and 

98.06 98.98 B: um 

99.84 101.09 B: [mn] let's see 

101.19 102.26 B: i also 

102.94 109.24 B: but not healthwise but i think gossip is also bad it hurts a lot of people who um 

107.01 108.84 A: yeah 

109.99 117.48 B: you know don't really even know that they're being talked about so i try to try to avoid gossip too but um 

113.88 115.83 A: right right 

116.40 117.55 A: (( [noise] )) 

117.56 119.79 B: i never have smoked and um 

120.29 122.25 B: overeating is something that's 

122.48 128.03 B: over i know more of a problem for me that i have have to overcome and try to not 

126.17 126.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

128.40 138.80 B: eat and i love to exercise so i don't know but i i think smoking is is the worst because it causes cancer and causes other people i read um i 

139.19 141.66 B: have young children and i read a um 

141.70 144.92 B: article a couple of months ago and it said that um 

145.51 148.11 B: parents who smoke around their kids um 

148.16 156.79 B: their kids are gonna have like high amount more cavities like five times the amount of cavities than um children who live in non smoking 

153.74 154.98 A: (( mhm )) 

156.93 159.34 B: homes and um 

159.84 164.22 A: plus they're at a greater risk for like asthma and that kind of stuff too 

160.01 160.83 B: (( you know )) 

163.46 172.61 B: yes yes and um yeah like second hand smoke and it just seems to just be a problem like when you go to a restaurant and you want a no smoking 

164.94 166.13 A: mhm 

172.68 179.17 B: table and you have to wait longer but they could put you in smoking right away but you don't wanna sit around it and 

178.49 179.78 A: right 

179.26 191.97 B: and the cost of it too that's i even have family who do smoke and they're always complaining that they don't have money for this or that but then they end up with i don't even how much cigarettes cost but they come up with 

191.11 200.55 A: oh i know they're ri- they're ridiculous um you know i told my husband i said even if smoking you know wasn't bad healthwise 

200.47 207.70 A: i don't think i'd ever wanna start it up again just how much it costs for each cigarette you know 

207.11 217.41 B: right yeah and they make it so difficult on smokers anyway like most employees you can't smoke in the office you have to go outside and we live in texas so 

217.36 225.16 B: you know it's hot most of the time so i mean you gotta stand in the heat to smoke something that's really bad for you um 

218.24 219.61 A: fine [laughter] 

225.43 234.17 A: what i like in my city in texas here is most of the restaurants i'd say at least eighty five percent are totally non smoking well 

233.88 236.89 B: yeah i saw that dallas had gone to that um 

236.80 238.45 A: i'm in arlington 

236.99 239.96 B: non smoking arlington okay 

240.02 242.56 B: um yeah we go to grapevine 

240.69 243.25 A: then we've been that way for a long time 

242.63 246.97 B: oh you have well that's nice we go to grapevine some and it seems that they 

247.63 259.32 B: um they still have smoking or not smoking or um i don't know maybe it's just the bar yeah that is nice if they have gone to just non you know non smoking establishment but that's even you know why 

259.39 263.05 B: make it even harder on the person to to smoke 

263.07 263.81 B: so 

263.42 268.14 A: so i think eventually then they'll they'll rule it out in bars and stuff too 

268.32 275.53 B: yeah i don't that would be big on the sm- on the cigarette industry if they did that 'cause i think a lot of people smoke 

275.58 281.18 B: just casually as they party or drink or whatever but um yeah 

279.82 280.97 A: right 

281.44 282.98 B: yeah i don't know i 

283.44 294.49 B: it's um hard and it must be just so hard to quit because of all the commercials and all the patches and gum and hypnosis you hear and i mean there's just as much 

294.71 301.62 B: information on how to quit smoking as there is on trying to get you to smoke so it must just be a horrible horrible habit to 

301.98 303.17 B: to stop 

303.11 309.70 A: [noise] well like i say in my case on my brain see i associate that with emphysema and 

309.41 311.50 B: uh-huh how many years did you smoke

328.20 329.50 B: right 

329.43 337.68 A: but there was just something some maternal thing or something in me i i couldn't stand to smoke and i couldn't stand to drink wine
