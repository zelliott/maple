1.27 2.45 A: (( hello )) 

2.21 4.78 B: (( hello my name's monty how ya doing )) 

4.40 6.58 A: oh good my name's bob 

7.10 8.36 A: and uh 

7.40 12.30 B: hi bob uh i i didn't hear everything they said so [laughter] [cough] 

10.25 19.71 A: oh well they were saying which do you think is worse um gossiping smoking drinking alcohol or 

20.65 29.52 A: [mn] i can't remember the last thing they said 'cause i decided that uh i i thought uh excessive drinking of alcohol was worse at the time 

29.37 33.02 B: yeah i i guess if it was excessive that'd be pretty bad um 

30.07 30.80 A: so 

32.59 33.37 A: so 

33.29 36.72 B: [mn] i don't know i'm pretty much against smoking so [laughter] i 

35.69 38.06 A: well i'm against smoking to and uh 

37.44 38.15 B: (( a- )) 

38.16 40.88 B: that one bothers me more than anything i suppose 

40.28 43.82 A: does it it they all bother me but uh 

43.67 55.75 A: the reason i probably picked alcohol is because it affects the behaviour more than the smoking i think does and you know i was thinking of drunks and i've known some people that drink too much and uh 

50.47 53.20 B: yeah i understand that 

56.02 62.16 A: it uh pretty much makes them abusive and uh [laughter] lose all their judgement 

60.15 67.14 B: yeah yeah i i agree with you there i mean if it's not controlled like you said if it's excessive then [mn] you know 

63.08 63.96 A: yeah 

66.94 70.38 A: yeah yeah that's true i mean uh 

68.02 68.79 B: no 

70.62 78.11 A: now the smoking bugs me because uh you know i don't smoke and i really can't stand the smell of it and it ma- makes people sick [laughter] 

75.73 85.30 B: i i agree with you there [laughter] i don't smoke either so [mn] that's probably why i thought that one was the worst they all were bad but to a point 

82.54 83.38 A: yeah 

83.95 85.07 A: oh yeah 

85.51 94.58 A: i guess maybe the reason i didn't say gossiping is 'cause probably maybe everybody gossips i'm guessing and not that it's not bad but uh 

89.19 93.83 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

93.97 97.34 B: yeah everybody does it at some level i suppose but [mn] 

96.35 98.10 A: yeah 

97.96 104.02 B: i say it's bad because a lot of times people don't even know what they're talking about you know when they're passing on information 

98.14 98.90 A: so 

103.84 106.21 A: well that's that's definitely true 

104.31 106.14 B: yeah 

106.66 107.56 A: so 

106.97 111.07 B: so you know sometimes damage is done that shouldn't be done you know 

110.89 112.48 A: that's true you can 

112.49 125.98 A: ruin friendships you can probably ruin companies and all sorts of things uh by gossiping i guess uh i would imagine in uh corporate world it's pretty bad i'm not real high up in any corporate thing but uh 

117.05 118.90 B: yeah 

126.59 128.11 A: it probably 

128.66 133.67 A: makes a a difference if you're you know that you can ruin a company by uh 

133.69 136.77 A: by spreading false information about perhaps uh 

137.01 143.22 B: oh yeah i'm sure peo- i'm sure some people do it on purpose just to accomplish some kind of goal you know 

137.18 139.04 A: uh leaders of it and all 

142.93 145.64 A: yeah that's true 

145.56 147.02 B: i'm sure they do 

145.88 146.62 A: so 

147.25 150.03 A: that's true so where are you at 

149.62 151.37 B: oh i'm in tennessee 

150.95 153.24 A: tennessee i'm in utah so 

152.96 154.59 B: utah really [mn] 

153.96 155.16 A: yeah 

154.81 159.77 B: that's that's cool the other callers i had were in philadelphia where they're at so 

159.18 160.10 A: oh 

160.24 163.44 A: philadel- well that's a little closer to tennessee than utah 

163.59 164.78 B: [laughter] 

164.15 166.39 A: so i think but uh 

167.23 169.36 B: you all remember what the other ones were 

167.39 168.13 A: (( what's )) 

168.93 172.68 A: uh i i don't uh remember the 

171.73 175.65 B: they say it so fast they only say it that one time 

174.18 178.70 A: yeah it was only the one time and that that made it kinda tough but uh 

179.60 184.30 A: i think uh those those were the ones that seemed let's see gossiping 

185.37 189.52 A: uh alcohol smoking 

188.51 190.74 B: (( and )) 

191.32 198.84 A: yeah see those those are the ones i remember those were the first three they mentioned and if there was another one i i don't remember it so 

199.23 201.93 A: it's too bad they don't give you a chance to 

199.32 201.49 B: yeah 

202.01 204.32 A: hear it again or something but uh 

204.00 208.22 B: well being being you're in utah there's a lot of mormons out there isn't there 

207.91 210.44 A: yeah that's true i'm one of 'em so 

209.82 214.75 B: oh really [mn] well they mormons don't drink do they at all isn't that like against 

210.47 212.26 A: yeah so obviously i 

213.32 214.24 A: no they 

215.13 224.98 A: yeah it's uh they're not big on drinking i mean i'm sure there's some mormons that do drink but uh the church is you know against drinking yeah no it's uh 

221.94 224.60 B: against it yeah [mn] 

225.18 230.02 B: well most churches are about the only one i know that just flat out accepts it is catholic so 

229.90 232.04 A: oh yeah well and they 

231.18 234.99 B: they pretty they pretty much drink all the time [laughter] 

233.53 242.95 A: there you go [laughter] but i think i would say that probably most churches probably don't think you should drink excessively is my guess so 

242.37 243.87 B: yeah 

243.54 246.02 A: but yeah they we don't uh 

246.20 256.92 A: drink and smoke just basically 'cause it's bod- bad for your body but uh you know my big reason for the drinking is uh i've just seen what it does to people and it ruins their families and stuff 

257.18 261.97 B: yeah i've seen that too [mn] there's a lot of people though that just have a few you know 

257.21 258.03 A: (( you know )) 

262.15 270.91 A: yeah and they don't uh i think it's more the like the alcoholics or or people that just get a little too much that really makes a 

270.97 277.38 A: makes a difference those are the ones that don't know how i guess people that don't know how to control it one thing you know 

275.37 286.67 B: yeah [mn] 'cause me myself i like a beer after work a lot of the times you know and [mn] but that's all i have is that one maybe two and you know that's it i don't you know i don't sit there and try to get drunk or nothing 

279.49 281.70 A: (( uh yeah a lot of people do that )) 

286.61 287.69 A: yeah 

286.94 291.74 B: but just something about a beer after a hard day [laughter] it tastes good so [mn] 

289.57 290.62 A: (( there you go )) 

291.62 294.14 A: yeah some people like to do that so 

294.01 300.93 B: but i've never smoked so i i'd say that was probably the worst one to me well like i said if it's excessive drinking then i'm with you on that you know 

300.61 301.77 A: yeah 

301.26 307.78 B: like i said i've seen the damage too you know and not to mention people driving when they're drinking and so 

305.71 308.97 A: oh yeah people getting killed and stuff 

308.98 320.66 A: now on the smoking i don't know how it is in tennessee here in utah and in california you uh you know you can't smoke in public buildings is it that way at all in tennessee 

317.91 319.78 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

320.26 327.60 B: yeah i think they started that about a year or so ago all public places especially like government buildings and stuff you know 

322.53 323.53 A: oh okay 

324.46 325.61 A: so i 

327.31 340.20 A: yeah well i like that 'cause it used to be i'd go out to eat at a restaurant and you'd walk through the smoking section to get to the little corner that wasn't smoking and you just smell like smoke by the time you got there and not 

328.91 330.07 B: (( so [mn] )) 

336.67 337.41 B: or 

339.29 347.56 B: or it's not even really separated so the whole time you're eating you know it's you're smelling it or it's going in your face i really hate that [laughter] 

341.13 342.04 A: yeah 

344.96 345.98 A: oh yeah 

346.53 355.42 A: that that used to happen all the time but now they uh you can't smoke in regular restaurants here and so i can actually enjoy eating out yeah 

352.52 353.66 B: oh really 

354.95 361.43 B: oh i'd like that no they still have the separate sections now or they say they're separate but like i say there's no wall or nothing so 

356.15 357.05 A: (( yeah that's )) 

361.01 362.08 A: yeah 

361.55 366.21 B: you know so you're still breathing it and smelling it and 

364.61 373.26 A: oh yeah well and we go to uh you know utah's next to nevada so if we go on vacation in nevada it's such a big change 'cause 

373.20 380.95 A: you know smoking's a big thing there i guess you know because people are gambling and stuff that you know they sit there with a cigarette in their hand a lot of time 

380.32 382.50 B: they're doing the drinking too i know 

381.75 386.95 A: uh well yeah that's true 'cause they get free drinks as long as they're sitting at a machine so 

387.24 388.46 A: but uh 

388.52 396.92 A: so that's kind of a big thing there it's but it's a big difference to just smell like smoke all the time when you're there and around in hotels and stuff so 

394.30 396.40 B: i hate that 

396.55 400.57 B: or like you meet a girl and she smells like a cigarette an ashtray you know 

400.27 401.74 A: yeah there you go 

402.27 407.65 A: yeah my brother uh he doesn't smoke but he married a girl at the time that smoked and uh 

402.63 403.34 B: (( no )) 

407.97 414.55 A: and i always wondered about that 'cause you know he can you can smell it but she doesn't smoke any more but uh 

410.28 412.01 B: yeah 

414.54 416.40 B: well that's good 

415.54 419.11 A: think it would be difficult for someone that didn't uh 

418.57 426.03 B: yeah well i even when you don't you know you can smell it just about anywhere you know you can smell it like in people's houses on their curtains and furniture and 

425.57 426.97 A: oh yeah 

426.75 427.59 B: so 

427.52 431.96 A: yeah yep boy that's that's uh 

432.68 436.17 A: that's uh those three topics right there [laughter] 

436.14 444.03 B: [mn] [laughter] i don't remember as i said i really don't remember the rest but she said it so quick and [mn] or the machine or whatever it is 

439.86 440.97 A: yeah 

443.58 449.46 A: yeah a recording or something i don't know what it is it was real quick that we got connected so 

449.62 451.38 B: yeah i was surprised really 

451.23 452.11 A: so 

451.85 454.52 B: i was trying to get my calls in you know 

454.24 455.18 A: uh-huh 

455.71 457.43 B: how many calls have you made 

457.20 459.03 A: oh this is my third one 

459.14 459.84 B: (( oh )) 

459.35 460.15 A: (( cool )) 

460.20 462.02 B: is that all you're supposed to do right 

461.36 468.85 A: uh yeah yeah they said there's a possibility of more at some time but uh i haven't heard anything on that so 

469.04 475.96 B: are you now you're saying this is your third one because i called called first or or did you initiate the call yourself 

473.51 474.55 A: uh 

474.96 481.39 A: no i i called in and then it said uh please wait while i attempt to locate another caller and then 

481.48 484.10 A: [mn] you're right there yeah it happened right away 

482.98 485.39 B: oh you see i just called in too so 

484.98 485.98 A: yeah 

485.48 490.05 B: [mn] this is the first one where i called in i had two other ones you know [mn] 

489.14 491.16 A: were they where the system called you 

490.53 495.37 B: yeah well they just called me up so i don't know how that works but 

492.14 493.07 A: (( oh )) 

495.12 501.15 A: i don't either but they've got a well i guess we've got to talk about gossiping for the next few minutes 

495.55 496.96 B: anyways 

499.82 504.20 B: yeah [laughter] i was gonna say we're not supposed to veer from the subject now 

501.31 501.99 A: so 

503.18 504.59 A: (( yeah still )) 

504.80 508.05 B: i was just curious 'cause i couldn't you know i don't talk to them so 

508.25 509.94 A: yeah no i don't either 

508.98 514.24 B: so i guess we're gossiping about university of pennsylvania [laughter] or university of penn whatever it's called 

511.54 514.03 A: there you go that's part of the subject [laughter] 

514.44 517.61 A: university of pennsylvania fishers but uh 

516.69 522.99 B: [laughter] i can't say too much though i can't gossip about 'em too much now [laughter] my parents are from there 

517.99 519.05 A: but uh 

521.05 523.73 A: oh you don't know anything about 'em oh are they 

523.40 525.43 B: (( yeah )) 

524.66 530.81 A: well that's i went to the university of utah but yeah i've had uh 

530.87 534.84 A: i'm trying to think if i've had any big experiences with gossiping 

535.66 541.77 A: no probably girls gossip more than guys guys just don't have a tendency to say as much i don't think 

541.46 544.61 B: yeah when they do it's just straight to the point it's you know 

544.56 549.69 A: yeah just this is what i think this is what happened you know that kind of thing 

548.67 550.20 B: there you go [mn] 

549.75 557.41 A: girls are more into the feeling thing so but uh so i i really can't think of much there 

556.22 567.89 B: and like i say as far as that goes it's like a lot of times people don't even have the right information you know and then they're talking about whoever you know to somebody else and are passing on something that they don't even know if it's true or not so 

567.37 569.22 A: (( yeah that's that's true )) 

568.42 574.12 B: 'cause to me it's just you know it's too damaging you know for persons whatever reputation character 

571.26 572.12 A: yeah 

574.82 576.15 A: yeah it is 

576.43 578.63 A: i remember hearing gossip about 

578.64 593.39 A: some girl in high school and i remember it colored the way i thought about her but i never heard that from her or anybody so i have no idea if any of it was true and you know i think back and i wonder well was any of that true maybe not you know 

587.24 588.03 B: (( huh )) 

593.16 596.81 A: i just heard it from a third party first yeah so 

593.45 595.51 B: [laughter] that's it you don't know 

597.30 599.89 A: a lot of times when when females go-
