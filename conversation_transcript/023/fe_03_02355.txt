0.76 3.17 A: hello my name is jennifer 

3.73 5.72 B: hi my name is patty 

6.06 7.94 A: how are you today patty 

7.51 9.25 B: oh just fine 

9.07 20.08 A: good good uh i guess we're supposed to jump right into the topic here i've not done this before so i i guess we will [laughter] do you do you wanna go first or 

14.94 15.71 B: um 

16.27 18.16 B: me either [laughter] 

19.78 28.86 B: um it it doesn't really matter um what we supposed to see which was worse drinking overeating not exercising i guess which was worse for your he- 

27.98 31.60 A: gossiping uh things like that yes 

31.26 40.82 B: right well i i guess if you're talking about healthwise um um i guess drinking in excess would be the worst thing 

40.99 42.59 B: or would it be overeating 

41.23 42.22 A: uh 

42.65 51.95 A: [laughter] oh g- i don't know um o- of the choices that were given i would have to pick gossiping of course it doesn't 

43.45 44.98 B: [laughter] 

51.92 61.99 A: affect your health particularly but i i do consider it the worst of everything that they you know mention because i think so much damage is done 

53.72 54.90 B: right 

62.09 64.60 A: by irresponsible gossip 

64.36 76.98 B: well i think gossip in itself maybe is not the worst thing as you said irresponsible gossip yes i think gossiping to some extent keeps our social um kind of 

76.89 89.00 B: people in line because if there's no gossiping then nobody has any kind of social cues to answer to so to speak but irresponsible gossiping yes i agree just slander and being malicious 

86.67 88.87 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

88.90 102.09 A: yeah your your point is well taken i guess it depends on you know to some degree on how you define gossiping and and just an exchange of information certainly there's nothing wrong with that it's when you get into 

98.78 99.99 B: right 

102.19 111.15 A: uh passing along rumors and particularly with you know things that can be harmful or hurtful to other people 

108.97 110.04 B: (( m- right )) 

110.13 120.00 B: m- maliciousness yes a- and just trying to um look good to somebody else by passing along some information absolutely i agree 

111.50 113.84 A: right right 

117.48 121.38 A: exactly or or to make people think that you know you're 

121.58 127.77 A: smart or whatever because you have certain information that they don't or something 

126.00 131.89 B: right well i i think i think gossip in itself has to be treated um 

131.78 142.22 B: as something that that if you pass it pass something along it's as information and not as something that could be really hurtful to somebody so yeah i agree but 

141.12 148.54 A: exactly but i- infor- informational i mean we all do it we couldn't live without doing it you know for that matter but uh 

146.57 147.74 B: well i 

148.43 156.28 A: just as far as oh so and so's pregnant and not married or whatever i [laughter] i think that 

148.83 149.73 B: right 

152.35 154.68 B: oh absolutely right 

154.59 169.47 B: right well just slander slander you know and and just being mean about it but a- as far as the other ones go um i know myself personally alcohol in in with people that i've known or whatever has played a huge role in 

157.46 159.45 A: exactly 

161.50 163.30 A: mhm 

169.52 173.23 B: um disrupting lives and causing a lot of chaos 

172.52 178.59 A: oh abso- well my my mother and my brother both drank and drugged themselves to death so 

177.03 178.96 B: mhm right 

178.60 185.59 A: uh mother was fifty six when she died and my brother was thirty and uh i mean that that scared me no end now 

182.23 183.69 B: oh goodness 

185.40 186.60 B: absolutely 

185.40 195.41 A: my husband and i do drink socially but we are very careful with it because like i say i i've had some really bad experiences with my family 

194.44 207.38 B: w- well so- you know social drinking is one thing and being responsible is another i i'm of course talking about the um just destruction of the family um because somebody c- 

197.12 198.98 A: mhm 

203.48 205.27 A: right 

205.81 208.06 A: like happened in our case yes 

207.64 211.57 B: right yeah my uh my children's father he's uh 

211.74 221.70 B: been in a lot of trouble he's been in d- you know prison and that kind of thing just from the drinking aspect and of course we're split up [laughter] 

216.58 218.05 A: mhm 

220.89 222.63 A: yes yes 

221.80 224.97 B: so yes this is good but um 

225.22 235.91 B: yeah so i i think that i never really dealt with it too much when i was growing up 'cause my immediate family didn't drink but as i as i've gotten older i can see that it's 

232.41 234.21 A: mhm 

236.02 238.43 B: pretty detrimental to a lot of families 

237.87 247.34 A: exactly well uh let me just ask you out of curiosity if you don't mind but based on your experiences and your observations 

242.94 243.71 B: mhm 

248.05 254.91 A: what do you think of the prevailing uh definition of alcoholism uh basically that it's 

255.15 264.99 A: an inherited trait and that you know i- if you start down the road of alcoholism that uh you know it can only get worse you can never get better 

265.29 274.60 B: um i think that genetics does play a role in being predisposed um to the likelihood of having a problem with addiction 

270.16 271.12 A: mhm 

274.29 275.32 A: mhm 

274.75 288.53 B: just as a lot of uh you can be predisposed to a lot of different genetic things um i think that you have to recognize that fact and um have to be more vigilant in dealing with it or finding other means 

279.01 280.09 A: right 

282.30 284.13 A: mhm 

288.42 292.10 B: to um you know learn how to deal with it [noise] 

291.49 298.13 A: exactly course that that's been my case is you know knowing that there's a predisposition there i have to really watch 

296.79 297.63 B: (( right right [noise] )) 

298.38 313.31 A: things um what what about the theory that you know once somebody begins drinking too much that they have to stop altogether the alcoholics anonymous thing that they can never have another drink do you think that's valid or not 

312.44 326.02 B: um i think i would probably say personally i believe probably ninety five percent yes i think there might be a small number of people um that that may not be the case for but i think overall yes 

318.19 320.06 A: mhm 

325.62 327.04 A: mhm 

326.27 328.28 B: that that probably is true 

328.08 329.65 A: very interesting mm 

328.30 338.37 B: um 'cause i've seen it i've seen it happen so many times um you know within my my own circle that i know that uh they stop and then 

335.87 337.57 A: exactly 

338.53 344.49 B: you know so i i can't say blanket statement yes but i would have to say pretty much yeah right 

342.26 351.55 A: mhm yeah but by the same token i i also have observed you know one in my family and also in my friends 

351.51 360.53 A: uh those that who can't seem to stop you know the downward cycle but by the same token i have also seen others that you know were able to do 

360.02 360.91 B: right 

360.57 365.12 A: and then you know get to a point where they could drink socially too so 

364.99 372.92 B: well i i think i think that's awesome i i think when when starting out on the road they probably have to decide that they're not going to drink at all any more period 

372.42 374.36 A: mhm mhm 

373.02 376.01 B: and maybe maybe you know somewhere 

376.37 379.58 B: if they get in a different place in their in their head [laughter] 

378.79 380.81 A: right right 

380.20 389.23 B: only they know where that's at [laughter] 'cause i sure don't but um that that you know then that would be something that they would have to deal with 

381.46 386.14 A: [laughter] exactly 

388.78 400.08 A: yeah so if if we get off the gossip end of it and just go back to what's detrimental to your health i think i would tend to agree with you that you know probably uh excessive drinking 

389.32 391.40 B: a- and and 

400.19 402.41 A: is just about the worst 

400.25 401.34 B: yes 

401.97 408.85 B: yes i i agree and and as far as the overeating goes i i think i can relate to that pretty strongly 

408.55 410.85 A: [laughter] 

409.10 417.21 B: [laughter] as my as my family is um very much genetically inclined to be uh heavy [laughter] [laughter] 

416.27 423.26 A: well mine mine is as well and uh i i fought my weight for years and years and years and years 

422.62 423.87 B: right 

423.22 433.72 A: but the older i got the more i took on the uh contours of my grandmother and there's been very little i could do to stop it [laughter] 

428.23 429.35 B: mhm 

431.82 439.09 B: well there y- you know actually that's because um right about seven months ago i just had a gastric bypass done 

438.42 439.90 A: mhm 

439.31 442.12 B: and so i've lost a hundred and ten pounds and 

441.41 443.19 A: oh congratulations 

442.81 450.41 B: absolutely but you know people are people are like well that was drastic it's like yes but sometimes when you have a problem 

450.60 457.92 B: you have to have drastic measures whether it be alcoholism or overeating or whatever the case may be and um 

454.89 456.87 A: [noise] right right 

457.97 471.25 B: and they're like well i couldn't do that and it's like well you didn't [laughter] it's like i can't i couldn't have done that because there are a lot of limitations or it is very strict it is very hard sometimes 

461.65 464.46 A: [laughter] exactly 

470.31 472.14 A: mhm 

471.27 482.84 B: um but um as far as the over eating's concerned i think that's a very much a genetic problem with your metabolism and also psychological with depression and et cetera like that 

482.13 491.03 A: well i i tend to think you know from my observation that it's more of a you know genetic predisposition than anything else because i do know that 

489.45 490.80 B: oh absolutely 

491.00 503.90 A: there have been times in my life if i am literally willing to almost starve myself to death and i mean eat absolutely nothing yes i can lose you know weight and maintain a weight loss 

497.03 498.95 B: oh yeah oh yeah 

499.27 500.41 B: mhm 

503.33 505.48 B: and then gain it back plus some 

503.79 518.32 A: but if i approach anything like normal eating i just you know start gaining weight and conversely i have some uh very thin friends who put away three times as much food as i do and aren't any more active you know 

507.03 508.35 B: mhm 

508.84 509.85 B: mhm 

516.06 517.02 B: oh 

517.87 529.30 B: oh absolutely and i'm i'm saying the metabolism itself i think is pretty much g- genetic but as far as as overeating like feeling that you have to eat even when you're not hungry 

518.48 520.73 A: (( [laughter] so )) 

524.40 525.76 A: yeah 

528.94 530.24 A: right 

529.27 536.18 B: is more of a mind thing 'cause i mean i know i've done it before i'm not hungry i'm either bored or i'm stressed or 

535.56 537.25 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

536.15 546.61 B: whatever the case may be and i'm putting something in my mouth [laughter] [laughter] it's like oh i don't need to be eating this ooh this is good [laughter] 

539.40 541.72 A: mhm [laughter] 

543.92 549.19 A: [laughter] well how about smoking where do you rank that 

549.15 556.94 B: um smoking i consider that pretty detrimental i i think i i have a mother right now who is uh has emphysema 

552.30 553.88 A: yeah 

557.01 558.01 A: uh-huh 

557.21 565.61 B: and um she has been you know in the hospital several times this year and she still has her cigarettes in her freezer to keep 'em fresh 

565.43 569.41 A: uh-huh uh-huh exactly 

565.90 568.18 B: [laughter] 

568.54 569.83 B: but 

569.88 578.06 B: i also know that they're highly highly addictive and and um 'cause i have friends and stuff they're like i wish i never would've started 

572.72 574.31 A: oh absolutely 

577.52 578.99 A: mhm 

578.16 581.48 B: so i i have to say that um 

581.82 584.11 B: it's you know if we can stop 

584.12 589.51 B: you know especially children and young adults from starting in the first place then that would be the best that 

585.76 587.60 A: mhm 

589.33 592.88 A: oh absolutely so you never smoked at all 

592.79 597.36 B: uh i'm i've smoked occasionally um like when i've been drinking or something but 

595.02 595.79 A: (( oh )) 

596.95 598.30 A: mhm 

597.70 599.30 B: not yeah 

599.34 599.90 B: (( yeah not ))
