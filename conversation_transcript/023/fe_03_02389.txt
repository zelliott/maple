201.25 202.15 B: the 

202.14 211.82 B: irritating the cigarettes i mean yeah people you can't stop people from drinking 'cause peo- 'cause remember we had prohibition one time try and stop people from drinking 

210.63 212.51 A: mhm mhm 

211.79 218.05 B: then they because they didn't do it but smoking is something that if you're going to do it go outside 

218.14 222.36 B: in an area where where only other people that smoke like to do it 

218.55 220.18 A: away from everybody else 

221.39 223.90 A: right be considerate of other people 

223.46 228.06 B: yeah when they had that with evils of smoking 

228.12 239.61 B: and restaurants stuff like that you see everybody get offended but nobody tell me i like to have a cigarette when i get after i get fin- eating or something like that but what about the people who's eating there and don't like to have a cigarette 

231.51 233.15 A: (( mhm )) 

235.75 237.72 A: or they go outside 

238.90 240.32 A: that's right 

241.83 248.13 A: but ah yeah i think cigarette smoking i guess if you know like we had to explain it does hurt everybody 

247.78 248.88 B: (( mhm )) 

248.26 250.62 A: alcohol second because 

250.75 252.50 A: that can hurt people 

251.64 254.54 B: because it's harmful r- r- 

253.01 257.38 A: right but exercise you're only hurting yourself if you don't exercise 

256.43 257.73 B: right 

257.58 260.51 A: so that would be bo- at the bottom of the list really 

260.12 263.36 B: yeah yeah they want to categorize it like you know 

263.59 275.92 B: but people but eating excessively and everything and just sitting round doing nothing yeah that if they want to categorize it there's nothing like smoking i feel the most offensive and and it 

274.39 276.42 A: that should be at the top right 

276.13 283.69 B: can be harm- it can be harmful to other people who have to inhale second hand smoke then there's drinking where people get violent or 

283.66 286.88 A: right that would be second yeah that would be the second thing 

283.99 285.48 B: get behind a wheel 

286.36 287.25 B: (( but )) 

287.46 291.11 B: like when they go to the bottom of the list like you say ah 

291.38 294.28 B: eating and stuff like that because that's 

292.49 294.64 A: right yeah because you 

294.45 296.86 B: hurting you it's not hurting anybody else 

296.32 298.34 A: no just you right 

297.87 307.09 B: i mean it makes people have low esteem or something because they say oh i can't lose weight but no you can't lose weight because you don't want to 

306.47 308.64 A: that's right 

308.74 311.64 A: i just lost twenty seven pounds [laughter] 

311.21 320.25 B: yeah i got a little weight and i'm walking and running every day now and try and get back down to my where my playing weight when i used to play ball 

319.70 321.78 A: oh that's good

323.46 324.77 B: yes it is 

324.19 334.27 A: but you gotta stick to it that's all and that's something that you you know that you have to be able to do yourself so like you say it's you're only hurting yourself if you don't do it 

333.10 334.30 B: (( yeah it's like )) 

334.58 342.15 B: that's why that's why i listed smoking as number one because you don't have to i mean you're hurting yourself that's 

337.50 342.68 A: (( yeah )) 

342.36 346.70 B: that's ah by surveys and by what the doctors and everybody says 

345.39 346.42 A: sure 

346.88 355.01 B: all the different chemicals in cigarettes yes you're hurting yourself but you're hurting everybody else when they have to breathe your second hand smoke 

354.76 358.97 A: and they've proven that and people still don't you know they still don't care 

358.63 360.95 B: yeah and what bothers me is 

361.06 367.43 B: all the young kids now here i mean one time smoking used to be the thing to do because
