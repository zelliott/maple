21.77 24.71 A: and uh you do get colds 

22.93 23.49 B: (( mm )) 

24.93 29.09 A: and if the only way to protect yourself is to stay away from people that do have colds 

29.35 30.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

29.86 32.73 A: because that's where you would be getting it from you're getting it from 

33.45 36.40 A: others that have it you agree right 

35.80 38.42 B: i do agree and i'm in 

38.74 44.74 B: los angeles where we don't have a change of season and it doesn't snow except for in the mountains 

44.87 49.38 B: and uh i was born in the midwest so i have experienced uh 

49.49 55.39 B: seasonal changes [noise] um but it still does seem to me that there is [noise] um 

55.44 58.32 B: illnesses that are related to the s- seasons 

58.35 60.07 B: um although 

60.14 63.88 B: they're not as severe as in other parts of the country 

64.49 65.83 B: this year 

64.59 70.27 A: well i think in new york you do get more colds and more illness because you've get freezing weather 

70.29 81.32 A: you do and i came to back from florida and the change in weather you do get sick [laughter] and there's really nothing that you can do to protect yourself except to stay out of crowds 

75.02 75.99 B: mhm 

80.73 91.14 B: [mn] yes i agree um of course dressing warmly in cold weather and um here that would be in the evening uh 'specially in the fall uh 

91.44 95.01 B: around those months it does get pretty cool at night but 

95.03 101.47 B: un- unless you encounter the germ you're not likely to to succumb to a cold or anything like that 

101.97 105.06 A: right that's how your you know 

105.55 109.38 A: your immunity is also some people are more susceptible 

107.34 108.25 B: mhm 

109.62 118.79 A: and the second question was about how we wait seven days do you go to a doctor [laughter] or do you just wait out your cold 

118.11 123.65 B: i usually just wait it out i i'm not one to go to the doctor unless i'm really sick 

123.61 124.85 A: sure me too 

125.07 125.97 B: (( [laughter] )) 

126.04 132.43 A: i don't go either i mean especially now for a cold the only time i mean you know if it was one of my children 

132.30 133.22 B: mhm 

132.48 139.35 A: and the cold is really going to the bronchial tubes then you need an antibiotic but otherwise there's nothing really that you could do 

140.26 142.27 A: (( you have to wait it out mhm )) 

141.24 151.21 B: [noise] that's true yes i i do agree um [mn] chicken noodle soup and orange juice [laughter] and all those wonderful things help [laughter] 

150.88 155.30 A: (( i have a lot of things here that i bought though i did have a cold about )) 

155.34 168.32 A: oh it was in january you know when i came back from florida i got a beauty and i was taking dimetapp and i was taking these you know four hour cold tablets i think they worked 

158.24 159.15 B: mhm 

165.46 166.04 B: (( [noise] )) 

166.17 167.23 B: mhm 

168.50 172.36 A: (( i think they masked it though i don't think they really )) 

170.46 173.83 B: oh yeah sometimes they do um 

173.87 174.87 B: uh 

175.06 181.57 B: have an effect on the symptoms maybe the runny nose or the cough but you may still actually have a cold or 

181.70 184.46 B: uh i'm not sure how that works but 

185.12 186.12 B: (( um )) 

185.47 190.07 A: (( [laughter] yeah i have them here i have dimetapp and then i bought a )) 

190.68 199.32 A: cough god i got vicks and all this stuff but thank god it didn't go into my bronchial tubes then i then i think i would have gotten some medical help [laughter] 

198.49 200.97 B: mhm exactly yeah 

200.28 205.34 A: (( but the cough i mean you've got to be very careful that you don't give it to anybody else )) 

204.07 205.84 B: yes that's true [mn] 

206.21 215.75 A: i mean there were studies that were done on this you could take [mn] thirty men and put them in a room in their underwear and only give them [laughter] you know [laughter] 

214.58 215.48 B: (( [laughter] )) 

216.06 225.80 A: cold water to drink with a you know fan on them they wouldn't get the cold but but the same thirty people in a room with someone else that has the cold they're going to get it 

218.98 220.00 B: mhm 

225.27 228.27 B: exactly yeah that's a very good point 

229.38 230.43 B: (( [cough] )) 

229.41 235.64 A: but the changing seasons really though i think the weather you have there in california is more stable 

235.68 237.08 B: oh yeah 

236.56 238.73 A: here in new york um 

239.66 248.12 A: i don't know we can have some days that even during the winter where it was sixty degrees and then we could go down to twelve 

247.85 248.86 B: mhm 

248.38 252.47 A: [noise] and then the wind chills and we'd wake up and we'd have like you know twelve feet of snow 

252.57 258.52 A: and you'd get frost bitten hands you know really it's uh very bad you really can't protect yourself that much [noise] 

252.62 253.64 B: sure 

257.54 261.98 B: yeah sure it's it's no telling what will happen i mean in terms of how the weather will 

261.99 263.47 B: be that day huh 

264.40 269.53 A: right it would and i think this year was the coldest winter 

269.64 274.07 A: and more people were sick with that than anything else 

272.34 273.29 B: mhm 

273.96 275.10 B: sure 

275.15 279.66 B: do you think allergies are also included in the seasonal illnesses or 

279.64 281.46 A: oh definitely 

280.59 283.12 B: yeah okay yeah 

282.51 290.19 A: definitely my son has asthma [noise] and he's only affected on it surprisingly 

285.91 286.86 B: (( mm )) 

290.38 299.08 A: not during the winter the snow is good it's when all the grass comes out and everything and then the symptoms are just like a cold [noise] [noise] 

291.87 292.82 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

296.59 297.38 B: (( mm )) 

298.10 306.42 B: sure yeah that's happened to me before in another state i lived in michigan for a while and that's when i found out i'm allergic to uh 

306.66 316.80 B: cut grass and ash trees and certain pine trees a lot of other things because in the fall it just really affected me 

316.56 318.37 A: [noise] [noise] did you go for all the testing 

318.28 322.52 B: i did i was i was really fortunate and they had a very good um 

322.75 329.18 B: um center there at the hospital and they were able to test me for all the different um allergens 

329.56 331.23 B: and that's how i found out 

331.93 341.45 A: [noise] [noise] oh but you know what it really doesn't help you for them to tell you you're allergic to timoti grass [laughter] because what are you going to do 

338.36 340.11 B: no [laughter] 

340.91 343.12 B: how can you avoid it right [laughter] 

342.03 345.13 A: you can't avoid it i mean [laughter] 

345.16 348.15 B: it's true yeah that that's a good point [laughter] 

347.36 358.33 A: do you know it's it's you know it's in the well i took my son too and he was allergic to flour and all this stuff but i don't think it really has that much difference i think it's the season 

358.31 368.88 A: when it's all that you know the pollen in the air it will just trigger off same symptoms like if you have a cold you're sneezing and you're coughing you're having difficulty breathing 

361.50 362.51 B: right 

364.71 365.93 B: mhm 

368.93 369.86 B: right 

369.31 373.02 A: then the flour comes into part but the 

373.31 382.42 A: winter is better [noise] for those that have allergies [noise] and it's really something it's just like you really have a cold the same thing is even with a dog or an animal 

374.60 375.57 B: mhm 

382.10 383.25 B: mhm 

382.76 386.35 A: that some people have the allergies towards them 

386.49 387.44 B: right 

386.80 391.65 A: and they look just like they have a cold their eyes get watery their mou- you know [noise] 

390.81 397.51 B: mhm yeah it's really bad um it it that was the reaction i had i felt as though i had a cold or the flu 

397.65 402.38 B: and um i didn't have a fever or anything and i come to find out it was just allergy reaction uh 

403.24 406.42 A: well there's a lot of medicines that you can take for that too 

406.40 407.84 B: [noise] that's true 

406.51 408.79 A: i mean i only get the over the counter 

409.14 413.05 A: 'cause as i say i don't go to the doctor for a cold or [laughter] but [noise] [noise] 

411.69 425.04 B: yeah i believe there's more people are suffering from allergies now that medicines have improved they're a a lot better it used to be they'd make you drowsy and you couldn't really take 'em during certain times but now they're much better [noise] [noise] mhm mm 

425.60 428.34 A: yes there's a new drug out [noise] singular 

428.67 440.05 A: that you take one pill a day and it's supposed to ward off attack and there's w and it's supposed to really make you better then after on this three months you might not need the inhalers 

438.82 441.44 B: [noise] [noise] that's great that's very good 

440.49 443.74 A: [noise] yeah um yeah i i read about it 

444.84 450.02 A: so this is one because the other ones is that you're on pills for the rest of your life [noise] you're on pills and you're on 

448.47 449.77 B: mhm 

450.03 452.47 A: then you offer to take shots 

451.96 453.13 B: (( [noise] mhm mm )) 

453.90 457.52 A: [noise] but um you see my son just looks like he has a cold 

457.10 458.56 B: mhm 

459.11 466.81 A: [mn] so for me i don't like the winter but for [noise] those that have asthma or any type of allergies they're better off 

466.34 468.93 B: [noise] sure that's true yeah [noise] 

468.57 470.61 A: [noise] in a colder climate 

470.29 479.24 B: even for um i was thinking about pollution [noise] um you know air pollution and it's better in the winter um because it doesn't have the 

479.41 483.37 B: well at least out here the heat the sun in the middle of summer 

483.60 488.32 B: um [noise] creates the smog effect it helps the smog along so 

484.03 484.80 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

488.42 493.91 A: [noise] do you know you know you're talking to someone from new york last year i was here for september eleventh

500.86 509.99 A: maybe not a hundred maybe fifty miles from the city i was nowhere near where it happened [noise] yet the air you're talking about pollutants was awful 

508.39 509.34 B: mhm 

510.26 513.19 A: you went out and you smelled [noise] smoke 

512.91 514.03 B: mhm 

513.29 517.90 A: you saw it in the air i mean and there was difficulty breathing 

517.68 519.68 B: yes yeah [noise]

530.62 533.17 B: [noise] [noise] mm i'm sure 

532.29 534.30 A: so a cold was you know 

534.45 537.22 A: minimized as far as this goes so 

534.64 535.60 B: [noise] 

539.50 541.89 B: yeah i can only imagine um 

542.19 550.84 B: here we deal with smog every day you know but if it gets worse at certain times of the year uh but i think something uh 

550.90 554.78 B: like nine eleven is just uh s- tremendous uh 

555.22 561.90 B: y- i mean the the air pollution effects and everything else it's amazing [noise] you know 

561.26 565.48 A: um [noise] [noise] right and a lot of these things too just made you feel like you had a cold or 

565.53 568.37 A: you're breathing the same things and [mn] 

568.49 579.22 A: but thank god they cleaned this all up there was still empty buildings in the city though anything within um like a ten block radius is empty 

571.27 572.92 B: [noise] mhm definitely [noise] 

578.04 579.06 B: mhm 

579.77 583.72 B: is that due to uh some restrictions or are they just 

583.53 588.52 A: well the all the damages damaged the pipes and um 

587.59 589.53 B: oh i see yes [noise] 

589.22 596.94 A: and the apartments whatever it was like you talk about pollutants were still in the air and still in the apartments and 

596.95 599.89 A: they thought it was a health hazard so everybody was out of that
