29.92 30.76 B: going to 

31.55 34.15 B: yeah i think gossiping is the worst 

34.07 36.26 A: you think more so than smoking 

35.99 41.68 B: well yeah because the gossiping people cannot defend themselves if they're if they're not around 

41.93 44.38 A: but what if they are around 

43.19 46.14 B: well if they are around it wouldn't be gossiping right 

45.46 46.67 A: it wouldn't be 

46.20 47.08 B: no 

46.95 49.12 A: it just be like telling someone to their face

60.07 62.94 A: consumer habits you know 

62.99 64.82 A: you know i don't know 

64.86 71.60 A: anything a c- a consumer does that is legal but still harms other people 

66.65 67.57 B: right 

71.36 72.23 B: true 

72.32 84.28 A: for instance like second hand smoke has been proven to cause these effects in children whose parents' smoke and i'm i'm assuming if you work in a bar or whatever you have higher health risk than the average person and 

84.22 86.03 B: (( that's v- [cough] very fair )) 

84.90 88.19 A: it just seems like it's a little unfair to the other person to me 

88.21 89.25 B: very true 

90.13 91.29 B: yeah very true 

91.04 92.01 A: (( i don't know )) 

91.64 92.50 B: [laughter] 

92.21 94.42 A: but you're right gossiping is pretty bad 

94.12 96.60 B: yeah because they can't defend themselves you know 

96.76 97.82 B: but um 

98.52 101.85 B: but um is this the first time you're doing one of these calls 

102.22 104.68 A: uh actually i did one yesterday

105.14 111.89 A: yeah i kinda work for the company who's doing these tests and they wanted they needed more people to do it so i figured i'd sign up 

111.69 112.91 B: oh it's interesting 

112.68 118.17 A: yeah where do you do you are you in the technology field or you just heard about it from a friend or

141.37 142.79 B: yeah so [cough] 

143.71 153.30 A: inter- yeah i find it interesting with i i talked to someone yesterday from like illinois or something and she just was you know a regular person who just called in i find it pretty amazing 'cause 

153.63 156.52 A: [cough] wi- the company i work for is 

156.56 165.81 A: and i guess i'm up to working on it in the future we're we're actually gonna be looking at all the data and figuring out what it means and helping to train the models and whatnot yeah 

163.41 164.39 B: oh really 

164.87 166.48 B: yeah sounds interesting 

166.48 169.57 A: it's very interesting it's interesting stuff 

169.15 174.59 B: well i've been do- doing surveys for several years but um i never did anything like this 

174.85 179.01 A: yeah it's very do you know sort of what's going on with the project or 

178.77 183.08 B: well well i have an idea but um not really if you you wanna explain it or 

182.90 186.30 A: yeah i mean what's what's happening is is that um 

186.87 189.92 A: i work for i work in a speech recognition division 

190.05 198.26 A: and in order to make a lot of the the in order to make a lot of the systems work you have to generate these models that sort of 

198.44 212.90 A: have a certain vocabulary in 'em and then you figure out the traits of the vocabulary and then they sort of match it up to the uh the user's speech patterns in their voice and they try to get similarities between what 

213.03 220.59 A: a user's word is that he says he or she says and then matches it to a word that's kind of already in your vocabulary say 

220.18 221.46 B: (( mhm mhm mm that )) 

221.05 227.45 A: so by getting all these people to talk about things and just getting different dialects and um 

227.53 236.68 A: you know different sort of like idioms that people talk about you're just we're building this big model so that we can get conversational speech you know 

236.70 237.77 B: (( that sounds )) 

237.78 244.75 A: yeah 'cause see right now with speech recognition is kind of hard for conversations like this because uh 

245.57 258.09 A: you know there's just so many there's just so many rules and so many times we break the rules but we can't but we can still understand each other that's hard for like an automated process like a computer or whatever to figure out what's really going on 

257.88 260.24 B: (( good [cough] excuse me science )) 

260.51 262.68 B: (( it's hard to understand science right )) 

262.37 263.22 A: what 

262.91 264.14 B: well it's science 

264.45 266.43 A: you're right 

264.95 270.56 B: yeah and so i- you never can really follow the rules with science because you have to 

271.22 273.37 B: you know [noise] go on your own 

273.78 275.41 B: judgement 

275.53 276.26 B: like 

276.33 280.13 B: so you're calling from like um right now you're located in a college 

280.03 283.05 A: no no i'm at a company in boston 

282.86 283.72 B: okay 

283.39 294.96 A: yeah so and yeah i guess the system i think that we're working with another school with this who who is actually administering the fisher project 

291.76 292.67 B: mhm 

294.92 298.72 A: but i think they're using some of our recognition models and stuff for this 

300.24 308.93 A: [lipsmack] so it's it's pretty interesting yeah uh what were the other options to that going i guess going back to the 

301.97 303.29 B: yeah it 

308.86 309.87 B: is subject 

309.53 315.27 A: subject what were the other options it was like gossiping smoking 

310.51 311.22 B: (( i mean )) 

315.67 317.24 A: uh 

317.48 319.00 A: i forgot the other ones 

318.64 320.35 B: oh my goodness [laughter] 

320.97 323.12 A: it it was 

322.75 324.28 B: i just remember those two 

324.53 325.31 B: because 

324.59 326.53 A: no drinking was one 

326.14 329.17 B: well some drinking yes you know [cough] 

328.63 329.66 A: uh 

330.82 336.16 B: but i don't i i hardly ever drink i don't know about yourself but well 

334.89 336.70 A: yeah 

336.33 337.35 B: i mean 

337.71 341.08 B: the last time i drank maybe was um several months back 

340.64 342.51 A: right 

341.29 342.44 B: so um 

343.81 350.20 B: you know occasional drink i guess is um wouldn't harm anything if you um if you're in a certain place with um 

348.32 355.20 A: yeah as long as you're responsible about it and don't you know don't drive or anything that's ridiculous 

351.73 352.80 B: exactly 

354.78 355.94 B: no that's true 

356.59 361.88 B: because if you [cough] excuse me if you drink and drive you're taking other people's lives 

361.76 362.86 A: exactly 

363.11 365.04 B: and um that's very selfish 

363.74 365.33 A: exactly 

365.67 369.38 A: very selfish kinda like smoking no i'm kidding [laughter] 

367.57 370.57 B: yeah well [laughter] yeah true 

370.31 379.91 A: but i guess it's not as as extreme right now but a lot of i think boston is uh they're out they're banning smoking in every public 

374.49 375.23 B: well 

380.19 381.20 A: place 

380.76 382.69 B: well they're trying to do that in new york 

382.62 384.77 A: yeah i think it's already in effect though isn't it 

384.71 390.92 B: mm i'm not really sure but i the last time i think i heard w- it pretty much was so if i'm not mistaken 

385.91 387.13 A: right 

389.00 392.56 A: yeah yeah 

391.92 393.05 B: so um 

392.80 396.39 A: uh so do you live near the city or are you more in 

396.18 398.05 B: i'm more in towards philadelphia 

397.78 400.48 A: towards philadelphia okay very nice 

398.77 399.89 B: mhm 

399.95 402.79 B: i live in like in the shore area 

402.97 403.80 B: so 

403.65 404.76 A: right 

403.83 405.12 B: [cough] excuse me 

405.35 414.87 A: oh that's nice i've never really been to new jersey i don't think i've driven and i and i live so close i mean i just i've driven through the top of it and that was it [laughter] 

408.90 409.50 B: (( mm )) 

414.27 418.42 B: [laughter] well i think boston's like how many hours away five hours 

418.34 420.02 A: from where boston 

419.60 421.92 B: from new jersey you know jersey and boston 

421.66 424.37 A: yeah it's probably something like that 

423.01 424.01 B: yeah 

424.53 426.15 A: (( but i used to live in connecticut )) 

425.96 426.85 B: oh 

426.47 429.59 A: so i was only maybe about two and a half hours away 

429.31 430.43 B: yeah 

430.24 432.40 A: from cer- from certain areas 

432.54 434.15 A: but um 

434.98 440.76 A: gossiping huh yeah i can see that i think that's that's respectable 

435.96 437.78 B: yeah gossiping number one 

438.86 439.56 B: i 

440.42 443.92 B: yeah because i worked in a office for several years and um 

442.81 444.66 A: yeah 

444.12 457.17 B: you see it you see it all the time and well even and people cannot defend themselves so i believe in if you if you wanna say something if you are going to say it you make sure you are able to say it in front of that person 

457.49 459.35 A: yeah 

457.90 460.02 B: you know what i mean you don't 

459.80 463.45 A: yeah exactly i mean that that only makes the most sense i mean 

462.81 463.76 B: mhm 

463.79 468.54 A: but i mean i just yeah you're right but i guess certain people are just sort of like 

468.52 472.60 A: and sometimes i do it myself i mean it's just like 

469.93 470.85 B: (( mhm )) 

472.57 483.77 A: you kinda wanna get it off your chest and you maybe it i guess there's some sort of thrill of knowing something that other people don't know and then you kinda feel like the person in charge by telling other people i don't know 

472.60 473.78 B: we all do it 

483.47 487.05 B: well i think it's part of our nature to gossip but 

485.22 487.01 A: yeah 

487.32 494.26 B: what it is is that i feel like anything i have to say say about you or anybody i'm willing to say it to you also 

494.32 496.18 A: true true true 

494.35 500.21 B: [laughter] yeah so um i'm not known as a gossiper at my work [laughter] yeah 

498.08 501.50 A: well that's good i think you should get employee of the month 

500.92 503.51 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] right )) 

502.00 503.13 A: [laughter] 

503.77 507.44 A: very good um what was i gonna say 

507.64 510.53 A: something about uh 

513.54 516.02 A: [mn] no yeah i think the reason why 

515.91 518.25 A: people gossip too mostly is that 

518.07 530.98 A: they kind of know that they don't have anyone to respond to them i mean sure people can stand up for their friends and whatnot but when you say it face to face to someone and they're like no i think you're wrong 'cause of this and they're like well blah blah blah then 

530.93 532.05 B: well that's true 

531.60 534.43 A: then they freak out 

534.87 536.08 A: anyways 

535.99 536.72 B: (( [laughter] )) 

536.58 537.52 A: uh 

538.67 541.08 A: so what else what else is new
