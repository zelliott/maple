0.09 4.85 A: hi this is cynthia and i'm calling from hollywood uh who's this 

4.58 8.76 B: this is dick calling from ohio 

9.04 13.63 A: oh all right i didn't know we it was all over the u._s. uh 

13.25 15.32 B: all over the u._s. yeah 

14.24 25.79 A: yeah well i guess what the topic is illness and how we take care of ourselves and i guess what they said about the seasons changing 

24.85 26.32 B: yeah 

26.01 33.33 A: well i guess uh since you live in ohio you do have the four seasons [laughter] 

33.15 34.74 B: yeah we do 

34.15 34.82 A: (( [cough] )) 

35.81 36.94 A: and 

36.09 38.82 B: (( we get 'em within seasons even )) 

39.59 41.38 A: so how i guess 

39.75 47.00 B: it's been spring for over a month and we've had two weeks of winter and two weeks of spring 

46.74 53.47 A: oh boy so i bet uh people tend to get sick a lot there because of that or 

53.49 54.96 B: well um 

55.12 56.53 B: colds 

57.57 68.45 A: you know it's funny because i'm here in southern california but lately our weather has been kind of funny w- even though we don't have the four seasons but 

68.57 79.19 A: um lately our weather has been unpredictable and we'll have ah one day it'll be raining and then the next day ninety degrees and then 

79.13 84.84 A: back and forth and i find that that really does a number on people's health and 

84.77 96.30 A: causes illnesses and um which also can be a drag because uh you know i try to you know i try to stay as healthy as possible and then 

96.25 100.38 A: when suddenly the weather gets unch- predictable like i find like 

100.55 108.18 A: you know it's funny because sometimes in the morning it will actually be warm and i'll be dressed warm and then all of a sudden 

108.37 117.22 A: uh the it'll it'll change on the weather will change on me midday and then suddenly i have to change my clothes or you know caught in the rain 

115.51 116.30 B: (( [lipsmack] [cough] [cough] )) 

117.08 118.10 B: yeah 

117.49 123.15 A: 'cour- 'course you guys you deal with the snow and all [laughter] all that [cough] 

121.14 125.48 B: right we don't get much snow i'm i'm in cincinnati 

125.29 127.11 A: oh okay 

125.98 130.62 B: we don't get too much snow we had about a total of thirty inches this winter 

130.12 131.66 A: ooh boy 

131.17 133.38 B: that's a total of the whole winter 

132.82 134.98 A: oh the whole winter oh 

134.05 137.56 B: yeah most we ever had was four or five inches 

137.54 138.94 A: mhm 

139.38 151.59 A: so i guess uh though when you get that snow and then well tell me when your seasons change uh do you find that that does affect your health too or is it 

150.50 153.89 B: well i- i've just had a kidney transplant 

153.25 155.95 A: oh you did oh 

154.67 160.10 B: yeah i had a kidney transplant this past year 

158.02 159.27 A: wow 

160.32 161.51 A: wow 

160.69 164.27 B: and i have to watch the seasons 

164.28 166.79 B: more closely than most people 

164.40 165.23 A: (( oh )) 

167.06 172.42 B: because when you get a transplant they give you anti rejection medicine 

167.10 168.36 A: oh really 

172.83 174.34 A: (( [lipsmack] oh )) 

173.57 180.30 B: and the purpose of that is to lower your immunity so you don't reject the new kidney 

181.20 182.46 A: oh 

181.78 186.31 B: or if you gonna get a transplant heart so you won't reject the heart 

186.79 189.85 B: or the whatever you have a transplant in 

190.07 191.14 A: mhm 

190.69 195.51 B: and when it gets changes in the in the seasons 

196.73 199.08 B: you think well it's all right 

199.19 201.99 B: it's just a few degrees difference 

202.43 208.63 B: but it's not it's it's it's real bad and ah you got to watch it pretty carefully 

202.53 203.46 A: yeah 

209.54 212.49 A: wow so then you have to uh 

212.86 215.77 A: uh take care of yourself even more so 

213.18 217.46 B: i got to i got to take a couple of things yeah 

216.24 217.53 A: wow 

218.20 219.23 A: wow 

218.34 220.31 B: when you get sick then you're 

220.50 223.12 B: (( fighting the kidneys even worse )) 

222.94 228.16 A: gee what does it feel like um when you get like a cold i mean 

228.20 239.20 A: does it make you uh more even more run down because of your kidney transplant or or how do you get s- like a stronger colds or um 

239.96 242.62 B: well i just get colds 

242.12 243.16 A: mhm 

244.41 247.52 B: i don't think i've had the flu yet 

246.94 248.02 A: mhm 

248.01 249.50 B: but um 

251.01 254.54 B: (( i think i got a flu shot last year i'm not sure )) 

254.27 255.24 A: uh-huh 

255.47 257.61 B: (( so i didn't get a flu this winter )) 

258.82 264.40 A: mhm so then you have to take extra extra care of yourself huh 

263.43 266.83 B: yeah you do i've never been that way before 

266.57 267.81 A: wow 

267.98 271.48 A: how long have you been in this condition again 

272.21 274.66 B: well it's six months today 

274.60 275.75 A: wow 

278.31 283.13 B: but they're a lifesaver those transplants they're miracles 

280.83 282.50 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

283.50 286.99 B: if you ever need a transplant boy go for it 

286.46 288.06 A: mhm it 

287.42 291.47 B: because it'll change it'll give you a whole new life 

291.74 295.04 A: oh i can imagine yeah 

294.35 298.13 B: i was on dialysis before the transplant 

297.53 298.95 A: wow 

299.63 308.20 B: and when that i didn't have to do that and i could eat the foods i wanted and i felt better and great even 

308.79 311.22 A: oh that's good 

311.31 313.61 A: [mn] thank god you got it 

313.23 316.13 B: sha- my wife donated the kidney to me 

317.17 319.16 A: mhm that's wonderful [mn] 

318.66 321.07 B: nobody else would 

321.02 322.19 A: gee 

323.11 329.35 A: and it is rougher for you there also since you do have to deal with those seasons 

328.71 329.88 B: right this 

330.00 334.49 B: i've always i've always said i like four seasons 

334.50 335.61 A: mhm 

335.58 343.15 B: but um since this transplant it's it's pretty uh it's dangerous 

342.87 344.67 A: [noise] yes yes it is 

343.84 346.18 B: cold weather especially 

346.06 349.90 A: oh cold weather is is more dangerous for you 

349.63 351.19 B: well you get colds 

350.73 352.99 A: oh yeah that's right 

352.52 353.90 B: and the flu 

353.84 355.14 A: yeah 

355.37 356.63 B: (( but then )) 

357.42 360.97 B: (( and you can tell right away i take my temperature every day )) 

360.78 362.23 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] oh )) 

362.50 365.22 B: i like to sit outside 

365.85 367.52 B: and um 

368.90 373.11 B: well the first sign my temperature goes up i have to stay inside 

373.25 374.93 A: mhm 

374.15 378.12 B: because the temperature change is an indication 

378.17 380.36 B: of disease or infection 

380.19 381.58 A: wow 

381.45 383.89 B: so you have to be very careful with it 

383.70 386.09 A: i didn't know this wow 

385.63 387.35 B: yeah 

388.57 391.95 A: so you have to be careful not to get a high temperature 

392.16 397.14 A: so i guess if you would get the flu it would really hit you harder than 

397.17 401.49 A: someone who didn't have have been through what you've been [mn] 

398.96 403.12 B: well see i have generally i run a low temperature do you 

402.85 403.77 A: uh-huh 

403.96 404.99 B: you do 

404.74 407.61 A: oh low temperature um 

406.06 407.03 B: yeah 

407.92 414.20 A: yeah i think mine's just kind of a re- yeah a regular yeah low temp yeah i would say maybe 

413.76 415.87 B: ninety seven ninety eight 

415.31 419.71 A: yeah something like that yeah mine's pretty much like that yeah 

419.72 424.20 B: and if my temperature's ninety eight point four i'm running a temperature 

424.41 425.91 A: wow 

427.10 430.50 B: but they don't want it over a hundred point five 

430.84 432.16 A: mhm 

431.60 434.66 B: if you do that you're supposed to call the doctor 

434.29 435.40 A: wow 

435.79 440.04 A: so you probably have to be extra s- careful during snow season then 

440.20 443.98 B: well i can't i can't really participate in uh 

444.02 445.37 B: winter anymore 

445.50 446.71 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

447.90 456.64 B: so you got to be careful of these season changes because the the interlude between the one season and the next season 

450.85 451.83 A: yeah 

456.98 460.58 B: getting into it has parts of both 

461.55 462.71 A: wow 

461.76 467.50 B: like [mn] like well for take take fall for in- for instance around here 

467.81 470.12 B: it can be warm 

470.53 473.06 B: going into autumn 

473.59 484.72 B: and then it can get part way cold and then it can get winter can be partly warm and partly cold and when you go from winter to spring well it's warm and then it's 

484.97 489.63 B: cold and then i mean daily or weekly so 

489.41 490.79 A: wow 

491.09 492.29 A: there must be 

491.31 496.12 B: you gotta you have to be careful with it in my condition you have to be extra careful with 

496.26 496.83 B: (( it )) 

496.28 497.43 A: mhm 

498.32 500.29 A: that just must do a num- 

499.18 502.43 B: you don't want to reject the kidney after everything 

501.14 502.56 A: yeah 

502.79 504.10 A: that's right 

504.51 507.03 A: it must do a number on your system 

507.26 509.96 A: yeah [mn] thank god you're alive 

508.55 514.14 B: but it's the wonderful thing it makes you feel you feel wonderful after that what it was
