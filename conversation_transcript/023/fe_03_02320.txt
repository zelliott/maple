23.07 24.35 B: (( good )) 

23.78 28.43 A: so um so what do you think about the uh the illness um situation 

28.72 32.29 B: [laughter] you mean the sars 

30.10 30.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

32.63 43.17 A: well yeah yeah let's talk about sars no i was actually thinking more like what they asked in terms of uh like what do you do to prevent you know catching cold and that sort of stuff 

43.71 46.03 B: i i take nutritional products 

46.28 52.66 A: right yeah i actually i agree i um i like uh you know echinacea and all that sort of stuff 

52.74 63.98 A: like just the whole complex of uh various like golden seal and echinacea and like little wellness um tablets that they sell on fourteenth street 

64.27 74.96 A: [mn] and the healthy pleasure stuff so that's um that seems to be working but um i don't really think you can prove that that much just exercise kind of eat healthy 

75.22 78.31 A: more or less um so what do you think about sars is 

78.55 80.32 B: [laughter] 

79.39 81.85 A: there any sars cases there or 

81.49 82.48 B: one 

82.49 84.23 A: (( oh really ouch )) 

84.45 89.20 A: yeah there's some sars um cases in uh chinatown here so 

90.52 91.41 A: (( it's not )) 

90.80 96.96 B: (( yeah well well the main thing with the uh your yourself is what has hurt the population )) 

97.14 100.11 B: from not being able to prevent 

100.15 102.76 B: you know colds flus and all that kind of stuff 

102.39 103.70 A: right right 

103.40 107.84 B: is the fact that people are too use too many antibiotics 

107.84 111.19 A: yeah that's that's pretty bad i i agree 

110.04 110.90 B: so 

111.04 116.21 B: that's what happens when there's some i'll give you an example my sister is a nurse 

112.71 113.40 A: right 

116.42 120.67 B: and she brought her kids up using antibiotics 

120.30 121.36 A: right 

121.52 129.77 B: and i didn't bring up my kids using antibiotics they would take vitamins vitamin c. and so on and then there was they were never sick 

127.89 128.77 A: right 

130.17 131.61 B: in fact i think i took 

131.46 143.27 B: uh my son when he fell in a barbecue once and it was um when um barbecue's on the floor he tripped on the mat and that was the only time i had to take him to a doctor but other than that 

142.67 143.66 A: yeah 

143.12 148.04 B: you know for uh colds flus and that stuff uh nobody has been 

148.16 150.83 B: my children haven't either or i to be honest with you 

150.71 151.69 A: yeah 

151.89 159.46 B: gone to the doctors 'cause as soon as you start using the antibiotics they just kill all the good bacteria that is in your system 

157.48 158.48 A: (( i know )) 

159.18 170.68 A: i know it's ridiculous but i mean it's kind of like it's basically that's the main stream approach and that's what people you know who are not really you know who don't bother like educating themselves and looking for 

159.54 160.52 B: and 

170.56 174.32 A: alternatives and stuff and that's basically what everybody is doing 

174.44 177.87 A: and that's pretty sad i think it's uh it's just uh 

178.43 186.67 A: and what about like going to the doctor that that's usually basically what you're going to be prescribed right you go to the doctors and that's what they 

185.63 196.91 B: yeah if you go to the doctor you just tell them what you want and they give it to you you go there and ask for the blue pill the purple pill [laughter] that's you don't even tell the doctor they tell you on the t._v. what to tell the doctor anyway 

188.49 189.26 A: yeah 

191.59 193.65 A: yeah yeah yeah 

196.63 198.18 A: (( right right )) 

197.60 207.04 B: so everybody goes to the doctor they see something new uh whatever the prescription is they put it on t._v. so everybody wants r._l._s. or whatever the name of the stuff is you know 

206.34 215.39 A: yeah i used to work actually i used to work um for a pharmacy um in the south i i lived in the south at one time i travel a lot but um 

215.54 229.26 A: anyways um so the pharmacist actually used to tell everybody do not ever take any drugs because this is so horrible and like all the crap that goes in there just you know pretty much try to stay healthy as much as you can and like you know just 

229.27 233.23 A: stay natural and just don't don't take any of that crap so 

233.30 237.58 A: and that's the pharmacist like what's fifteen years of training telling you that [laughter] 

238.33 239.58 A: so um 

239.18 244.92 B: well the pharmacist is going to know what not to take also better than the doctor because you know he 

244.60 245.61 A: yeah 

245.33 253.27 B: he actually gets educated on the pharmaceutical pharmaceutical part where the doctor's not really educated the salesman comes into the doctor's office 

253.69 257.52 B: and tells him here's a set of golf clubs if you sell so much of 

257.04 258.39 A: exactly 

257.62 259.09 B: redlin or something 

259.27 260.31 A: yeah 

260.19 266.28 B: so as far as colds is if you go to a doctor what was the question she said if you go to a doc- doctor you 

265.54 271.54 A: it's like seven days or a week you know versus a week you know on your own so that was kinda 

271.64 273.01 B: (( yeah if you were some )) 

271.89 278.63 A: pretty much just say meaning that you know either way it's still going to be a week so at least a week 

278.95 284.68 A: and you know what it's it's actually you know and she also used to say like you know unless you actually 

284.94 298.98 A: unless a miracle happens you actually have to give your cold like a little time to develop and kind of get go away because when you nip it in the you know nip it in the bud then it's like like bullshit right so you're not going to be able to 

298.85 302.85 A: (( then you're going to get cold sick again because that's all you know )) 

303.21 316.45 A: it's all going to come back because you you haven't really cured it you're going to kill it with antibiotics and then whatever right and then you and actually after antibiotics you feel so sick and like wasted this is bad 

316.37 320.26 A: you know and if you're still at work this is just killing you 

320.38 326.02 A: because you're drained like your your energy has gone and it's just uh i don't know i hate them 

326.36 335.12 A: but again there are cases when it's totally you know there's no way around it but if you can help it then it's better not to take antibiotics i think 

335.07 338.74 B: mhm if you have some sort of infection 

336.62 337.43 A: so 

339.07 340.47 B: like you could have a oh uh 

340.93 347.06 B: you could use a couple of things out there for like sinus infections rather than antibiotic you could use like colloidal silver 

346.85 347.98 A: right 

347.78 353.82 B: and that's a product you could spray into your nose or whatever and go down your i used it once wh 

351.35 352.42 A: mhm 

352.99 363.80 A: yeah a lot of those a lot of nasal things sprays are very addictive though like it is better to rebuild you know that one i don't think but i mean a lot of that stuff is is just uh 

363.94 375.50 A: people really don't know but it's like it's pretty bad i mean like two or three times unless you actually you know interrupt right there and then you get addicted to that stuff and then it's even worse 

373.81 374.67 B: (( mhm )) 

374.89 377.76 B: yeah colloidal silver is is just silver 

376.71 379.09 A: yeah yeah exactly 

378.72 387.23 B: so it's not addictive it's just uh it kills it kills bacteria and it is known to kill even virus er infections 

380.26 381.16 A: yeah 

387.09 389.38 A: yeah so that's good 

388.68 391.57 B: so it's something that won't hurt you [laughter] 

390.95 393.51 A: (( yeah that's terrific i mean that )) 

393.70 406.37 A: [mn] and then again you know if you take this echinacea stuff now like they're saying like if it's over exag- exaggerated like all the effects of it but still you know jesus it's like the indians have used it for for many many 

406.22 415.00 A: you know for a long time and and that's basically just a natural way of um just trying to strengthen your immune system so i think that's 

415.19 417.69 A: (( it's not ever going to hurt your aims and and plus )) 

417.04 419.21 B: (( no no i think echinacea's all right )) 

418.61 424.27 A: yeah i mean it's not like you you're going to see the effects but i mean just you know you take it when you feel like under 

424.53 427.54 A: the weather and hope for the better eh [laughter] 

427.86 440.69 B: yeah well the stuff works that does and another product that's real good is a ga- garlic product which is high in alyssum and tha- that's known to kill the kill a cold or 

436.72 437.68 A: right 

440.70 443.10 B: anything that's bacterial also 

442.93 444.82 A: yeah that's nice 

444.23 446.82 B: (( there's a lot of stuff out there although )) 

445.67 448.30 A: i know [laughter] 

447.37 452.53 B: mind you not too many people get educated on it i mean they don't even know about it you 

450.14 451.57 A: yeah 

451.64 458.54 A: i know yes that's bad i mean usually like if you compare like the system to you know sweden or 

458.57 461.51 A: just any european countries it's just um 

461.44 474.83 A: [mn] i don't even know it's not like the doctors are not educated enough the doctors are but i mean a lot of them are so completely hard headed about stuff and they're not really following just all the latest and greatest results 

474.86 486.09 A: and um like for example i found a a dentist in georgia that's like completely out of this world the guy's like on top of things he's like totally amazing 

486.08 499.57 A: and there's nobody like that in new york [laughter] absolutely nobody and i asked him like did you have any like good dentists in your academy who moved to new york and he was saying well they're all old school you know 

499.95 506.46 A: so it's it's just bad i mean i i'm really for progress and like for finding you know 

506.54 510.27 A: doctors who can understand and kind of just uh pretty much 

510.45 523.45 A: they're not going to put you on like steroids hormones and all that sort of crap right but um it it's difficult because the main stream dentistry or what would just be that just regular practitioners they're all 

523.92 525.45 A: (( kind of )) 

525.11 527.61 B: know people are getting poisoned also from their 

528.09 531.90 B: which kills the immune system too is the mercury in the fillings 

531.90 544.69 B: and that kills your immune systems so therefore that's detrimental to your immune system and that and then you know you you get more susce- susceptible to colds and flus and all that kind of stuff 

537.73 538.82 A: right 

544.33 545.80 A: yeah 

545.52 548.91 B: so people are loaded with mercury and that stuff don't go away 

548.97 550.28 A: right [laughter] 

551.09 555.14 A: so forget about not eating fish this is like it's in your teeth 

551.15 552.04 B: (( and then )) 

555.77 558.64 B: then it gets it just drips into your system 

555.78 556.58 A: so 

558.35 559.36 A: yeah 

559.41 563.23 B: until it gets where it wants to it gets lodged in all your organs 

563.83 567.10 A: yeah i know that's that's ridiculous right 

567.30 580.32 A: what about like all the m._p._a. crap that they're not even like what about like food colorings and like all of that stuff and like artificial flavors and colors i mean i i cannot believe that this is not illegal 

567.38 568.36 B: (( and )) 

580.56 586.54 A: this is i know it's like a multi billion dollar industry everybody likes colors but like what the heck right 

586.85 588.64 A: it's bad stuff 

586.96 592.65 B: well the colors they're not too bad it's the stuff they all your artificial uh sweeteners 

593.21 598.27 A: well even that well like what about like you know g._s._m. and all that crap you know 

593.26 594.14 B: that 

597.87 599.89 B: well g._s._m. and and
