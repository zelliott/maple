0.60 2.58 B: hi uh my name's heather 

3.14 4.34 A: yes 

4.44 5.78 B: hi what's your name 

6.09 7.31 A: sarah 

6.81 7.89 B: hi 

8.19 12.63 B: so what do you think about the seasons and uh getting a cold 

12.06 16.98 A: when the seasons and you get a cold is that i didn't quite understand what they said 

16.89 24.63 B: the topic was uh when the seasons change some people are more likely say to get a cold like in the winter than in the summer time 

24.82 26.83 B: what are your uh thoughts on that 

27.35 28.81 A: um 

29.18 31.47 A: yeah i would say usually 

31.97 35.88 A: going from winter to spring or from fall into winter 

36.55 38.88 A: i oftentimes get a cold 

39.99 45.58 B: yeah i guess i would agree with that i live in santa barbara so it's pretty temperate here 

45.76 48.48 B: so we really don't have seasons as much 

48.61 54.63 B: but you know it's a little bit rainier so i guess that you know maybe i might get a cold more likely i 

48.90 49.89 A: right 

55.05 59.57 B: guess it's not a topic that i would dwell on too much [laughter] 

57.38 58.37 A: [laughter] 

58.65 61.80 A: we're supposed to be like talking about this for ten minutes 

61.40 62.48 B: uh-huh 

62.42 63.39 A: [laughter] 

63.75 69.10 B: they'd also said what are some things that you do uh to avoid getting a cold 

69.54 70.64 B: so 

70.02 73.51 A: right oh hand washing and uh 

73.45 74.67 B: yeah 

75.07 76.64 B: (( i often that's a )) 

75.35 84.65 A: right my daughter goes to nursery school so she brings home lots of colds from school so we do a lot of we try to do a lot of hand washing 

85.27 86.52 B: good idea 

86.96 91.76 A: um my husband's convinced you get a cold from 

92.10 94.05 A: being out in the rain 

94.36 96.79 A: (( which i don't believe [laughter] )) 

96.45 105.47 B: [laughter] well i guess if you were to go out in the rain like with no jacket on and you got chilled that could affect you i suppose 

103.46 104.42 A: right 

105.50 108.96 B: but not if you're wearing a heavy jacket [mn] 

111.06 117.61 B: what do you think about vitamins and supplements do you think they play a role like echinacea taking that 

118.15 119.47 A: (( um )) 

120.72 126.21 A: i think that they i don't know i sort of think that somehow that maybe the vitamins d. and uh 

126.90 135.74 A: and uh um other things that you might take when you already have some of the symptoms may help to reduce them but i don't know about prevention like i 

134.87 135.76 B: (( mhm )) 

135.92 138.95 A: haven't been sold on that argument 

139.55 142.85 B: like you don't take echinacea when you get a cold 

142.21 144.52 A: (( um no i haven't )) 

144.10 146.00 B: mhm 

145.27 146.08 A: no 

146.70 149.83 B: i do sometimes but i don't know if it'll really works 

150.15 151.22 A: mhm 

150.38 152.20 B: necessarily [laughter] 

155.24 156.66 B: oh what else 

157.28 162.35 B: what about going to the gym and fitness do you think that helps prevent getting a cold 

162.34 167.75 A: oh well i'm sure it prevents almost every bad thing underneath the sun i just i've 

168.10 171.88 A: i don't exercise regularly so i haven't i i 

171.94 176.16 A: i would tend to believe it but i just don't do it so i can't 

176.60 180.39 A: say that i believe it from my own practice 

180.76 183.04 A: i imagine it's good for everything [laughter] 

183.42 184.01 B: (( uh-huh )) 

184.37 188.30 B: oh i used to be a trainer used to work for gold's gym 

188.57 192.03 B: and after i started working out more i noticed that uh 

192.10 196.10 B: i got less colds and less sick often so 

196.40 199.34 B: it must boost your immune system i suppose 

196.46 197.37 A: (( mm )) 

199.60 203.15 A: right and you just feel generally better 

203.56 205.46 B: yeah and i started taking 

204.28 205.73 A: more energy 

205.50 207.31 B: multi vitamins too 

208.13 210.03 B: when i started working there 

210.75 214.28 A: (( and your health registers stress and if you're prone to stress you are more )) 

214.75 217.10 A: susceptible to colds probably 

216.91 217.92 B: mhm 

220.25 221.00 A: (( mm )) 

220.91 225.76 B: do you live in a temperate climate or do you live where there are seasons 

224.08 226.08 A: (( i live in new york city )) 

226.23 227.60 B: oh okay 

226.42 227.30 A: so 

227.38 228.71 A: it's pretty 

229.05 229.85 A: much 

229.91 231.01 A: four 

231.28 232.15 A: (( you know )) 

232.63 233.78 A: um 

234.80 237.52 A: separate seasons very 

237.76 242.41 A: much their own [laughter] we had a terrible spring it's been very cold and wet 

239.19 240.07 B: right 

243.79 244.86 A: and 

243.87 253.12 B: do you enjoy uh the seasons i hear that sometimes when people move out to california they miss the seasons and or would you rather live in a place where there is no snow 

253.75 257.10 A: um well i don't mind the snow but i don't like 

257.14 260.72 A: the winter [laughter] it's true it sounds kind of ironic but 

260.87 265.33 A: just the snow's not bad it's just the l- the the m- 

265.48 271.90 A: long cold days in march where it ju- ju- just continues to be cold and grey and 

272.30 283.41 A: oftentimes wet but not actually snowing um so i wouldn't mind living further south where there is a shorter winter but you still have the four seasons 

283.44 284.01 A: (( it )) 

284.83 286.78 A: just the winter's 

286.83 294.75 A: too cold and too long starts in late october and it's really not that warm again until april end of april so 

295.91 303.67 B: yeah it's interesting in santa barbara like sometimes it'll be like january and oh like a summer day or it'll be like eighty degrees 

303.69 309.33 B: but then like a couple of days later it'll it might be cold and rainy so it really changes a bit 

307.63 308.61 A: yeah 

310.17 311.28 B: interesting 

311.71 312.76 A: you don't get 

311.71 316.70 B: we really don't the leaves don't change color here at all like you don't see that [laughter] 

314.82 315.92 A: (( oh okay )) 

317.25 322.51 A: right that's what most people miss i think when they move to the west coast but the autumn 

323.42 327.08 A: oh and well and spring can be pretty glorious too 

326.85 327.93 B: mhm 

327.32 330.06 A: (( after a long winter [laughter] )) 

329.84 330.53 B: (( [laughter] )) 

330.84 331.77 A: um 

332.19 335.76 A: and also i bet it must nice when you kind of think uh 

336.10 340.74 A: since you do get uh many sunny days there even in the winter time 

341.17 345.09 A: i think a lot of people just here suffer from 

345.18 348.40 A: just mild forms of depression because of the 

348.64 352.08 A: the long winters and not seeing the sun and 

352.63 357.18 B: yeah i've heard that too like you need a certain amount of sun exposure 

357.25 358.23 A: (( whatnot mm )) 

357.39 366.31 B: like i read a study once where in uh seattle washington they have the highest suicide rate there because of all the rain and people don't get enough sunshine 

366.40 367.23 B: (( so )) 

366.61 368.24 A: they have the highest what 

367.46 371.00 B: depression rate they have the highest suicide rate in seattle 

368.63 369.45 A: oh 

370.40 372.35 A: (( oh suicide rate mm )) 

372.78 375.66 A: well i know that when um 

375.89 378.87 A: both my kids were little and they were nursing they 

379.22 382.61 A: i think its vitamin d. that they don't get enough of 

382.45 383.53 B: mhm 

382.91 384.20 A: and so they 

384.54 391.03 A: especially in the winter time with their newborns and they're exclusively nursing they should get 

391.27 395.02 A: as much outdoor light exposure 

395.32 396.25 A: (( i don't know )) 

396.26 397.25 A: that's just 

397.41 400.42 A: even if it's not direct sun just the just the 

400.59 401.91 A: outdoor light 

401.97 404.33 A: somehow is good for them 

404.45 405.86 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

404.51 406.73 A: if they can have be deficient 

406.41 415.09 B: the sunlight i think uh it helps you absorb vitamin d. so even if you're like taking a supplement and you weren't out in the sun you wouldn't be able to absorb it 

415.18 416.06 A: (( mhm )) 

415.55 421.09 B: so it causes deficiencies i don't know if it causes depression but it's 

421.25 422.45 B: interesting 

422.62 424.00 A: mhm 

424.38 425.19 B: (( hm )) 

426.35 428.09 A: so we've t- w- 

428.24 431.81 A: doing a good job exhausting our [mn] trivia 

430.34 433.22 B: [laughter] 

433.82 435.93 A: i've never done this before have you 

435.59 437.41 B: no i haven't 

437.54 439.55 B: just seemed sort of interesting 

439.65 440.91 A: mhm 

440.15 441.10 B: (( so oh )) 

442.25 443.48 B: let's see what 

442.93 443.75 A: (( mm )) 

445.16 448.80 A: so does it get very hot through the air conditioning in santa barbara 

450.10 453.60 B: um does it get hot with the air conditioning 

453.29 455.46 A: no but is it that you would need it 

455.04 463.78 B: oh you know what not really um there'll be like a couple of times you know like in july maybe 

463.78 470.73 B: but there's also a lot of fog here too so even in the summertime it keeps it cool 'cause it's by the ocean the fog comes in 

471.42 472.40 B: so 

472.62 478.33 B: it really stays within like a certain range like sixty to eighty like most all of the time 

478.38 479.43 A: mhm 

480.10 480.88 B: but 

480.56 487.57 A: um 'cause i think some people a a lot of times get colds here in the summertime from going in and out of 

488.03 491.58 A: you know the extreme heat and humidity to the 

491.79 500.66 A: the air conditioned offices and homes and you kind of go from one little oasis to the next 

493.52 494.52 B: oh 

500.91 511.39 A: [laughter] kind of like going from your home to the car to the office to the store 'cause it's it can be really um uh brutal outside with the heat and humidity 

511.41 514.45 B: does it get like over a hundred degrees in new york 

514.68 520.66 A: um no it doesn't actu- i mean well with what we call the heat index it does 

520.59 521.30 B: hm 

520.70 522.92 A: um but the actual temperature 

523.18 533.48 A: um you know can we'll have two weeks straight where it will be ninety two degrees or something but it feels much much hot- hotter with the humidity 

534.38 535.48 B: wow 

535.56 536.53 A: yeah 

536.52 544.63 B: i heard there's like this remote control thing that you could do with your car to like start the air conditioner on so your car would cool down a little bit 

536.63 537.46 A: which 

544.61 546.48 A: oh really i don't know 

546.11 548.20 B: never heard of that [laughter] 

547.58 548.60 A: (( no )) 

549.03 551.20 A: we [mn] i've heard of 

551.51 553.97 A: everybody's kind of blacked out at the heat but 

554.70 555.34 B: hm 

554.90 558.59 A: we don't yeah though that kind of technology doesn't 

558.60 559.70 A: (( uh )) 

560.04 560.84 A: (( is it )) 

560.85 565.01 A: is popular in the city or not it's dependant on cars but there's 

565.06 571.12 A: still plenty of them [mn] but we're not got a lot of garages and parking spaces [laughter] 

566.84 567.48 B: (( ha )) 

572.49 573.24 A: (( mm )) 

573.81 579.40 A: they you have a lot of i mean santa barbara has a what's the public transportation like 

579.51 581.66 B: uh mostly cars 

579.75 580.72 A: (( pretty good )) 

581.69 585.81 B: um there's the bus system but no one likes to use it 

585.15 586.24 A: uh-huh 

586.40 596.13 B: so it's mostly all the cars there's no other subway or anything like that here and there's like hardly any taxis so everyone drives everywhere 

591.05 592.13 A: mhm 

598.29 599.95 B: (( santa barbara's pretty small ))
