152.92 157.36 A: and [mn] yeah that that is a good rule [laughter] 

156.73 165.32 B: well and it sounds like uh sounds like you have some integrity 'cause a lot of people uh go to work and pretend that you know they're okay when they're really sick

196.92 198.27 B: was it sars 

198.58 204.35 A: no [laughter] no this is a long time ago [mn] before there was sars 

199.47 201.22 B: [laughter] 

201.81 203.56 B: oh okay that's good 

204.41 208.64 A: but he caught this virus a long time ago um when he was 

208.65 220.15 A: they had these floods and he was um [lipsmack] anyway he was do- doing some service and helping people at the floods and he was out in the water and there was some kind of bacteria in it 

220.22 229.38 A: he gets this so he has this virus in this bacteria and like every time the seasons change like twice a year he g- he gets really sick 

229.56 230.63 B: wow 

229.96 232.80 A: so you know it's kind of sad but 

232.81 238.32 A: he actually it w- y- it was really bad like he almost died and then he 

232.83 233.77 B: (( [noise] so what )) 

238.35 243.20 A: actually went yeah he tried like all these different medications and all these different 

238.36 239.56 B: oh wow 

243.32 249.53 A: um you know te- the doctors test him for all these diseases and all the stuff anyway 

249.91 254.27 A: the only thing that helped him is he went to this um chinese medicine doctor 

254.37 265.41 A: and gave him these herbal supplements yeah and so every time he every time that the season changes he takes these um this herbal medicine and he doesn't get sick 

254.43 255.62 B: oh really 

265.21 267.60 B: wow well i can honestly say uh 

267.63 271.57 B: i didn't put much faith in witch doctors but that's pretty convincing 

270.20 271.17 A: [laughter] 

271.45 278.96 A: yeah i know it was amazing well he you know none of the doctors they just kept giving him like pain killers and you know 

277.78 279.55 B: yeah 

279.02 281.50 A: they had no idea what it was and 

280.76 282.06 B: those creeps 

281.85 294.38 A: yeah so [mn] ah you know they didn't i mean they believed him they could see he was in pain but you know they were just like oh well there's nothing really we can do because we tested you for everything so 

290.51 291.42 B: sure 

294.68 297.79 A: that was like really a blessing that he 

298.33 303.78 A: was able to go to that and he was a skeptic at first too he was like well i don't know 

304.25 305.23 B: yeah 

304.52 308.77 A: but it turned out to be really good so [laughter] [mn] [mn]

376.16 379.53 A: yeah well more not so flashy 

381.19 391.18 B: yeah well it's probably a lot easier to stomach anyways uh than people that have a flesh eating virus that eats half their face off like the people i saw
