5.70 6.75 A: how are you 

6.49 8.17 B: i'm all right how are you 

7.56 11.01 A: i'm okay i don't know if i caught all those traces there did you 

10.15 15.33 B: yeah kind of a tough topic um over eating or drinking 

15.63 16.99 B: gossiping 

17.46 18.79 B: smoking 

19.73 20.73 B: um 

20.77 22.71 B: i don't remember the rest 

24.27 28.99 A: no i don't either i think i think 'cause um a couple just stood out when i heard 'em 

29.05 30.01 B: yeah 

29.25 30.55 A: the first time 

30.82 33.56 B: i guess some are more controversial than others 

33.19 34.13 A: right 

34.61 36.42 B: (( like smoking )) 

36.49 37.84 A: you think smoking 

38.76 40.64 B: yeah and over drinking 

41.44 44.81 A: yeah those are the two that i that kind of stood out for me 

45.02 46.56 A: i think um 

47.45 48.01 A: (( a )) 

48.65 55.31 A: lot depends on the circumstances of the drinking but i think the smoking because it it um effects other people too 

55.77 60.32 A: oh not necessarily i guess i guess it depends where you smoke and where you drink [laughter] 

59.93 61.42 B: yeah that's true 

61.70 62.68 B: um 

62.87 66.31 B: i live in minnesota and you 

66.43 70.24 B: barely can smoke anywhere any more 

70.93 74.61 A: yeah it's the same here i'm in i'm in rochester in new york 

74.46 75.25 B: oh 

75.08 77.81 A: and um actually just last week they 

78.06 84.67 A: we for a while here we had restaurants that were um had smoking and non smoking sections and then just ah 

83.84 84.66 B: right 

84.97 91.25 A: actually maybe two weeks ago now they we don't even have non smoking sections in restaurants it's a complete 

90.58 93.84 B: i thought that was just in the city is that state wide 

94.19 97.88 A: um i don't know if it's state wide it's in the city of rochester though 

97.63 98.49 B: oh 

99.11 99.98 A: so there's 

99.22 103.46 B: i know they did in new york city and i don't know how that's going to go over 

103.01 104.75 A: they did do it in new york city 

104.25 105.44 B: yeah 

105.14 106.24 A: (( well )) 

107.57 115.53 A: it's going to make it more difficult for people but i'm sure they'll find ways around it because actually the restaurants that i've been in since then um 

115.54 120.04 A: people are smoking in the bathrooms which makes me feel like [laughter] i'm in high school again 

120.13 126.53 B: well that's how i feel when i drive through a business district or by a hospital you see these 

122.93 124.05 A: mhm 

126.73 128.07 B: men in 

129.00 133.70 B: twelve hundred suits standing on the sidewalk like juvenile delinquents 

133.97 137.46 B: or surgeons in their scrubs out on the sidewalk 

134.04 135.00 A: right 

137.53 138.54 A: yeah 

138.59 148.44 A: i'm a teacher and at our school um the teachers have to go out on the sidewalk too to smoke which is i think it's kind of a bad influence for the kids because they can't even do it 

148.54 151.74 A: you know i mean i'm not a smoker myself and i 

152.03 155.79 A: i don't encourage it but i'd rather have the teachers smoking in some 

155.82 158.24 A: confined area than out there 

158.27 160.22 A: in view of the students 

158.33 159.19 B: right 

160.04 161.41 B: exactly 

162.29 163.27 B: and 

163.74 170.53 B: it takes the teachers down to i'm not saying it's a bad thing but down to the students level 

170.92 171.86 A: right 

170.93 172.17 B: to um 

172.57 174.43 B: you know i'm no better than you 

174.62 177.84 B: i have this terrible addiction just like you 

178.67 179.66 B: (( i don't know )) 

180.93 182.27 B: it's just ah 

183.64 193.90 B: i think that people have taken it too far i think a lot of people like even if you're outside smoking some people will 

191.57 192.76 A: mhm 

194.12 201.95 B: wave their arms and exhale and make a big scene out of it and those are the same people that will sit for four hours 

201.97 207.36 B: in four lanes of bumper to bumper traffic inhaling exhaust 

207.80 209.48 B: and that doesn't bother 'em 

207.84 208.97 A: right 

210.20 212.41 A: i think people don't think of that as um 

214.41 218.66 A: i i i don't think they're as aware of that maybe as smoking it's it's 

219.60 222.06 A: i guess as a non smoker i think th- 

222.44 224.11 A: i'm just more um 

224.26 229.53 A: sensitive to the the cigarette smoke because i think the you know carbon monoxide fumes are 

229.59 236.85 A: are not something you can smell anyways but if i sat there thinking about it i'd probably want to hold my breath [laughter] in the traffic 

234.96 237.09 B: (( yeah exactly )) 

237.24 238.35 B: yeah 

238.42 240.03 B: i am a smoker 

239.56 240.64 A: you are 

240.22 242.53 B: yeah and um 

242.74 244.62 A: have you smoked for a long time 

244.47 247.81 B: yeah since i got out of high school um 

248.81 249.42 B: (( phew )) 

250.49 254.10 A: and do you have have you had any kind of health related problems with that you 

253.95 254.73 B: no 

254.18 255.80 A: would connect with the smoking 

255.53 256.33 B: no 

258.21 260.11 A: i'm not sure what it is there's um 

260.68 271.52 A: this is just i would for some reason i i had a feeling when you when i heard your voice that you were a smoker though i guess i guess it's something that i notice i pick up in in people's voices 

266.15 267.08 B: yeah 

271.48 278.39 A: um because i'm i'm the only one of my siblings who doesn't smoke but i hear something in their their voices that 

278.73 282.39 A: i don't know maybe it's something i'm just a little sensitive to 

283.26 288.14 B: now that's very interesting that you picked up on it because i think that's really true 

288.42 289.52 A: mhm 

288.63 289.90 B: you're um 

290.32 294.80 B: there are again those stereotypes about women who talk like this 

294.77 295.77 A: right 

295.35 297.35 B: (( i need another smoke )) 

297.38 298.26 B: but 

298.74 300.26 B: (( i think it probably )) 

300.96 307.55 B: does kind of lower your voice you know there is a certain i can't deny there's a certain amount of congestion 

302.96 304.12 A: mhm 

307.51 309.42 A: yeah because i can hear um 

310.42 322.08 A: like when my sister especially she's my younger sister but when i hear her talk on the phone i can hear um like in between when she's speaking i can hear her take little breaths that i don't hear other people take 

321.80 323.73 B: yeah 

322.70 323.90 A: on the phone 

323.96 327.84 A: so wo- would you say y- you think you're probably physically 

328.02 331.29 A: in as good a shape as people that of your own age 

331.74 334.45 A: you think your endurance is as good 

331.79 332.77 B: um 

333.87 335.75 B: probably not no 

336.59 339.59 B: but i'm not terribly active either 

339.02 340.51 A: mhm 

339.89 341.37 B: i think um 

343.19 348.35 B: oh i know that i used to be a synchronized swimmer when i didn't smoke 

346.86 348.19 A: oh wow 

348.44 351.67 B: and then i could hold my breath under water for 

351.69 355.31 B: jeeze long long time i can't do that any more 

356.18 359.24 B: but again i haven't that's been years it's it's 

360.43 363.34 B: you know there's a practice element in there too 

363.07 364.14 A: right 

363.53 366.97 B: to keep on doing something you've got to be able to maintain it 

367.78 372.67 B: and if if i you know i stopped now i don't know if smoking has all 

373.11 376.39 B: that much to do with it or just a lack of practice 

377.44 378.93 A: yeah it's hard to say 

379.49 381.20 A: have you ever tried quitting 

381.89 384.61 B: not seriously i never have 

385.35 388.55 B: i um i probab- i i really 

388.76 391.11 B: would like to not be a smoker 

390.68 391.75 A: mhm 

391.52 392.47 B: but 

392.63 395.61 B: i enjoy it too much to give it up right now 

395.95 398.68 B: and nobody can make make you do it 

398.47 399.45 A: right 

399.07 400.00 B: you know 

400.59 401.85 B: and um 

402.30 405.21 B: my doctor's always offering me patches 

405.79 411.92 B: and i was well if i t- put a patch on then i can't smoke at all right right 

412.96 415.51 B: and i'm like well i'd better not 

416.52 420.82 A: yeah my brother my sister's never tried quitting and i have two brothers 

420.87 421.94 A: um 

422.10 428.49 A: only one of them's ever tried quitting actually in the past he's he's quit twice and gone as long as 

428.65 433.57 A: i think eight months he said without smoking but he's gone back to it and then 

433.76 435.60 A: um on easter 

435.64 445.98 A: he he quit again i guess he'd been planning that he just picked a date and then so i guess like three weeks before easter he said that easter was going to be the day he quit so 

446.25 449.91 A: he he's gone on a week and a half now he's doing okay again 

449.84 451.07 B: (( good for him )) 

450.13 452.34 A: but for him the um 

453.11 464.32 A: i mean he had the incentive of you know he didn't he didn't wonder whether there was any health problems down the road but he said just um when he looked at the money that he was spending on his cigarettes too it was just getting ridiculous 

463.83 468.52 B: yeah it's getting it's getting to be worse and worse here in minnesota 

468.82 473.11 B: there's a bill now we have this huge state deficit 

472.80 473.86 A: mhm 

473.60 477.27 B: and the governor has proposed and it's probably going to pass 

477.45 480.26 B: a dollar a tax per pack 

480.70 482.52 A: just the tax is a dollar 

482.02 483.68 B: just the tax 

483.21 486.01 A: wow and how much does a pack sell for there 

486.09 493.72 B: um i don't smoke like your regular named brand winston marlboro but i think they're like four fifty well 

489.64 490.54 A: (( and )) 

495.08 498.90 B: i i think you could probably get them for three fifty if you were careful 

499.04 501.53 A: it'll be a dollar more on top of that 

500.98 502.24 B: yeah 

501.64 502.69 A: wow 

503.95 510.92 A: my sister and her husband we um there's an indian reservation about an hour from here and they go to that that indian reservation to buy their 

511.16 514.77 A: cigarettes but i think she s i think they're still paying 

515.47 516.72 A: (( um now )) 

517.72 521.02 A: what did she say she told me like eighteen dollars for a carton 

520.70 522.10 B: oh that's cheap 

522.30 523.69 A: yeah 

523.05 526.34 B: cartons here are over thirty dollars 

526.83 530.65 B: i smoke really the cheapest cigarettes i can find and i you 

526.93 528.02 A: wow 

530.75 533.10 B: know because they're always coming out with new ones 

532.49 533.51 A: mhm 

533.15 537.57 B: i go into the store i just say what's your cheapest carton of cigarettes 

537.28 538.49 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

537.85 541.23 B: and i i pay about fifteen dollars 

541.35 542.15 A: hm 

542.57 548.05 B: ends up being sixteen fifty with tax and now i imagine that'll go way up too 

548.66 551.38 B: but i don't even know if that's a good deterrent 

551.95 552.79 B: um 

551.96 553.63 A: i was going to ask you that 

553.97 559.73 B: people keep coming up with the money and you know i heard about this tax 

560.08 568.00 B: and it didn't it made me angry but not because i personally thought i was going to have to quit but because 

569.62 571.80 B: [sigh] cigarette pack i mean 

571.83 577.27 B: they say it's going to be a deterrent but they're just really unfairly taxing 

573.79 574.90 A: mhm 

577.28 579.71 B: the smokers to make money 

580.82 583.18 B: because they're trying to close this deficit 

583.38 587.65 B: and how can you on one hand say what we're doing is so bad and wrong 

587.67 591.70 B: and on the other hand enjoy the taxes that you place upon us 

592.34 594.52 B: i just think that's hypocritical 

594.44 599.55 A: yeah a friend of mine was saying the same thing not that long ago and um
