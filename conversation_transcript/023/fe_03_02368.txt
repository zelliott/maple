7.26 8.40 B: i'm good 

8.97 12.27 B: so um what do you think is the worst of the subjects 

12.75 18.41 A: uh actually i only heard the first three and i c- 

16.84 17.76 B: really 

18.73 20.80 A: didn't really hear what she was saying 

20.96 23.28 B: i think it was smoking 

21.05 21.92 A: (( gossip )) 

23.29 28.09 B: drinking alcohol um drinking too much caffeine 

24.93 25.79 A: uh-huh

34.48 36.02 B: yeah [laughter]

42.65 45.90 B: yeah me too that's exactly what i thought smoking

48.87 50.95 A: smoking yeah yeah 

50.07 52.33 B: like you bother other people with 

51.18 54.27 A: a a lot other people can be affected by it 

53.46 56.31 B: yeah like second hand smoke and stuff 

56.12 60.61 A: yeah and then smoking can cause more than one thing as well 

59.76 65.04 B: yeah yeah and it's probably the one that's most likely to kill you or 

65.27 68.00 B: give you like some kind of serious um 

68.10 69.75 B: illness or something um 

69.34 75.26 A: right it can yeah lead from one thing to another that's what i was thinking when she said smoking 

72.30 73.82 B: yeah 

75.34 76.95 A: 'cause alcohol you can 

77.50 80.60 A: you know it depends on how you drink or 

79.84 87.77 B: yeah i guess you have to w- you have to drink like a really excessive amount for it to like hurt you badly 

80.92 82.29 A: (( consume it or )) 

84.65 85.43 A: (( yeah )) 

87.47 88.94 A: yeah 

88.69 90.64 B: so you d- you don't smoke huh

92.80 93.97 B: yeah me too 

94.37 95.82 B: yeah [laughter] 

97.15 101.02 B: yeah do you have people around you that smoke or 

97.58 98.36 A: so 

100.51 101.96 A: uh no 

101.14 102.64 B: any of your friends or anything 

102.81 104.47 B: yeah i don't i mean 

103.56 115.46 A: no i don't really associate with a lot of people but the people i'm around are more more or less non smokers i have a br- one brother that smokes but he's not normally around 

110.38 111.67 B: yeah me too 

115.37 117.37 B: do you try and tell him not to and stuff 

117.25 123.06 A: yeah well but he's grown now so [laughter] you you can you can 

119.74 124.12 B: yeah but he won't listen [laughter] yeah i have a brother too that smokes 

123.42 127.74 A: [laughter] you can give out the information but what people do with it 

127.30 128.45 B: (( yeah i know )) 

128.00 129.71 A: you know it's up to them 

129.60 140.01 B: yeah it's crazy because when you try and tell people not to smoke they it's like they just don't get it you know what i mean and you're just telling them everything that's wrong with it and you think that they would be like you know 

134.32 135.30 A: yeah 

139.84 141.36 A: yeah it a- 

140.07 143.80 B: i'm never smoking again but for some reason they don't seem to get it you know what i mean 

142.87 148.04 A: no 'cause most people are like it has some- it has to personally affect them 

147.75 150.76 B: yeah yeah 

148.13 149.44 A: like you know 

149.53 155.78 A: touch them real something real close to home has to affect them before they stop doing 

152.44 153.58 B: mhm 

155.88 162.90 A: something that we might think is negative and they don't most people are like that you know what 

159.07 160.89 B: yeah 

161.17 167.00 B: yeah i guess they're thinking oh i won't get cancer or i mean you know it won't happen to me it will happen to someone else 

164.08 164.85 A: yeah 

165.64 166.79 A: yeah 

167.16 169.88 A: or i'll quit when they say you know 

169.02 170.22 B: yeah 

169.92 171.24 A: or this or or 

171.38 179.65 B: or if they're young and they think oh nothing's ever gonna happen to me you know what i mean and then they say oh i'll quit when i get to thirty or forty or whatever 

175.58 176.71 A: yeah 

179.76 188.56 A: or something like where they'll say well i don't know anybody who got cancer from smoking and you know my mum and dad smoked or something you know 

185.02 186.14 B: yeah 

187.77 189.25 B: (( yeah i know )) 

189.00 191.69 A: and they didn't nothing happened to them so 

191.03 192.31 B: yeah 

193.28 195.88 A: yeah that's what i'm thinking too [laughter] 

194.62 196.44 B: yeah [laughter] 

196.01 203.68 A: i don't i mean i don't you know 'cause i see how it i can't walk past somewhere that was someone was smoking or 

202.98 204.14 B: yeah 

204.08 212.46 A: you're going to a restaurant and it's really smoky i'll eat out because then your clothes smell like you've been the one that was smoking 

207.65 208.96 B: yeah me too 

211.75 213.68 B: (( yeah in your hair uh )) 

213.24 218.29 A: yeah [laughter] yeah i go home and take a shower and all that sort of stuff 

214.34 216.90 B: [laughter] and it's hard to get the smell out 

218.19 220.03 B: yeah 

218.40 222.46 A: and it wouldn't have happened if you know i wasn't around that type of 

221.62 222.47 B: yeah 

223.44 224.57 A: (( you know or some )) 

223.49 227.42 B: do you think that less people are smoking now or like the same or 

226.61 232.10 A: well everywhere i go i see somebody with a cigarette somewhere or outside of a building or 

229.37 230.46 B: (( yeah )) 

232.26 233.27 A: you know 

232.74 239.23 B: yeah and you always hear people saying they're trying to quit but they don't you know oh i'm trying to quit you know 

233.60 235.09 A: and it seemed like that 

236.49 237.56 A: yeah 

238.67 250.63 A: yeah then they show that one commercial you can quit in three days and all that stuff and i'm thinking if that's really true and if you really wanna quit more people would try that and they wouldn't be running that commercial as often 

242.50 244.29 B: (( yeah )) 

250.15 251.60 B: yeah 

250.90 253.89 A: you know you they g- they would try it more 

254.03 255.80 B: yeah 

254.42 257.59 A: and r- you know if that's something they wanna do 

257.49 261.17 B: yeah i guess people are just h- hooked uh like um 

258.23 259.23 A: and then other 

262.52 263.34 B: but 

262.68 270.07 A: yeah then other people think more or less like well you've gotta die from something so why not smoking cigarettes you know 

268.88 270.69 B: yeah [laughter] 

270.24 272.45 A: people have i don't care attitudes 

272.65 278.49 B: (( yeah it's really expensive as well huh cigarettes i think i think it's very expensive oh )) 

275.98 283.28 A: yeah i seen that this man [mn] i thought he had bought a whole lot of stuff and he was in front of me in the line 

283.38 293.50 A: and he um the man told him seven dollars and some some change [laughter] and he only had [noise] a pop and a pack of cigarettes [noise] and i was like 

287.94 289.57 B: (( my god )) 

293.78 294.88 A: okay 

294.60 295.84 B: yeah 

295.40 297.63 A: that's a lot of money for some cigarettes 

297.35 301.08 B: yeah and it adds up 'cause they smoke it every day uh 

300.21 301.32 A: yeah 

302.15 302.93 B: (( it's )) 

303.76 307.27 B: so what do you think would be the second worst one on the list 

306.54 307.25 A: (( it's )) 

307.41 309.40 A: (( okay we had um )) 

310.58 311.76 A: may- or or 

312.17 314.14 A: was it or something was it 

313.31 314.78 B: i think it was um 

315.00 316.07 A: (( smoking )) 

315.21 323.05 B: drinking too much or drinking too much caffeine or not exercising or um eating too much i think 

323.26 324.23 A: (( well )) 

324.46 329.14 A: for me would probably between eating [noise] too much or not exercising 'cause that 

327.72 329.11 B: yeah me too 

329.72 333.03 A: (( that can be a hazzard in itself )) 

332.68 335.63 B: yeah 'cause that then you're not going to be healthy huh 

335.51 343.87 A: right you're anyone um some people eat and don't gain weight other people eat and then gain weight and then 

341.22 342.70 B: yeah 

344.66 348.15 B: yeah i think everyone's different huh their metabolism or whatever 

344.88 346.11 A: (( some people )) 

346.28 347.36 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

348.04 350.25 A: yeah 'cause like for me 

350.40 357.33 A: uh out of all my mum's kids i'm the [noise] skinniest one that she had [laughter] and i'm eating all the time 

354.28 359.05 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

358.23 363.02 A: you know and they say like i stay at a normal weight you know like all the time 

361.05 362.78 B: yeah 

362.82 364.11 B: you're lucky [laughter] 

363.14 364.06 A: and 

364.21 367.79 A: well yes well i think the only time i've ever been 

368.80 371.89 A: bigger than my weight is my two pregnancies and that 

371.48 374.70 B: yeah so do you exercise 

372.35 374.03 A: was my my daught- 

374.91 382.86 A: y- yeah i did exercise i walked around a lot always walk or i used to run a lot before my first pregnancy 

376.60 377.95 B: yeah that's cool 

378.46 380.08 B: yeah that's good 

382.47 384.29 B: (( yeah )) 

383.15 388.46 A: and shoot that's been almost sixteen years ago [laughter] and my ba- baby's eight 

386.55 390.01 B: oh [laughter] yeah i run i love it 

388.49 390.56 A: they're fifteen years apart 

390.68 392.41 B: yeah 

391.30 392.16 A: so 

392.34 396.90 A: but i think that overeating can be 

397.09 400.02 A: a problem 'cause it can cause other things 

400.45 402.27 B: yeah 

401.11 403.26 A: in your healthwise that can um 

403.10 404.95 B: yeah i think it's um 

405.07 410.60 B: like lately it seems like a lot of guys are saying that they like bigger women or whatever 

410.78 417.23 B: and it probably encourages some some women to like um not worry about their weight do you know what i mean 

416.83 418.01 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

417.54 419.56 B: do you think have you noticed that 

418.19 420.87 A: but they're still not they're still not healthy 

420.27 423.37 B: yeah exactly like it's not healthy for them 'cause they're thinking 

421.05 421.85 A: (( yeah it's )) 

422.42 432.53 A: not healthy for them they're thinking it's cute to please somebody else in the long run it could cause heart attack diabetes cancer lung disease 

425.39 428.79 B: yeah i know and that's wrong you know 

429.45 430.99 B: yeah 

431.51 446.12 B: they get all kinds of health problems 'cause they're thinking oh you know my boyfriend likes a big butt or whatever and and it's cute and so they don't bother to like exercise or like watch what they eat and then in the future they'll probably have like health problems and stuff 

432.99 434.05 A: yeah 

437.63 438.54 A: yeah 

443.82 449.29 A: yeah the future yeah health problems 'cause you can overeat and you know and 

448.64 450.35 B: yeah 

449.97 451.84 A: you can get heart disease 

451.45 456.60 B: yeah and it's kind of bad 'cause the guy is like not worrying about that he's 

451.89 453.39 A: get diabetes 

454.78 462.09 A: yeah when when then when you're sick you know they started moving all away done moved on to the next candidate you know 

458.25 459.55 B: yeah 

461.25 468.16 B: yeah and it's like he he's just worrying about what pleases him rather than actually caring about their health or anything like that 

462.16 463.10 A: (( now then )) 

465.68 474.30 A: right now when he moves onto them and then she's still not gonna be healthy because either she's moving away or overeating and then that cause stress 

473.88 474.77 B: yes 

474.45 478.09 A: you know and that causes a- all other kind of problems too so 

477.54 479.38 B: yeah 

478.71 483.90 A: that's probably what i think um not exercising follows in that too 

483.59 485.36 B: yeah 

484.26 488.90 A: because if you're not getting the proper exercise and you are overweight 

486.89 488.00 B: yeah 

488.97 491.57 A: you still can come up with some of those other 

491.59 493.61 A: (( kind of health problems )) 

492.14 498.17 B: yeah and you need to like have your heart healthy and stuff like that so 

493.88 494.63 A: (( yeah )) 

497.37 498.68 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

499.99 506.01 B: yeah like i know some over weight people and it's like when when they walk and stuff 

505.96 507.90 A: (( so yeah yeah they're tired )) 

506.37 509.25 B: you just hear their breathing and it's like [sigh] 

507.94 508.72 A: (( uh-huh )) 

509.45 514.78 B: you know and you feel like oh my god like he's gonna die or she's gonna die you know because um 

513.72 514.71 A: (( yeah or uh )) 

514.90 516.52 B: they're so unhealthy 

515.36 519.26 A: you offering 'em water and they're looking at you like you're crazy 'cause 

518.58 520.52 B: yeah [laughter] 

519.74 521.87 A: 'cause you're concerned you know 

522.37 530.59 B: yeah i think because there's a lot of overweight people and stuff as well they feel like it's okay because it's like normal or whatever because it's you know 

531.69 534.31 B: there's a lot of people like that but 

533.61 534.36 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

534.39 536.22 B: they should think about their health 

534.64 546.53 A: people that the the most most people i find today have this i don't care attitude w- like the whatever attitude okay so whatever i'm fat whatever i eat 

540.82 542.58 B: yeah 

543.23 544.96 B: yeah 

545.82 549.50 B: yeah and they're like oh well i i'm happy the way i am or whatever 

547.05 548.62 A: so what i smoke 

549.38 553.85 A: yeah so what i smoke so what i drink as long as i'm not bothering nobody el- you know 

551.30 553.08 B: (( yeah )) 

554.30 557.29 B: but they're not thinking about their health and stuff 

554.35 556.87 A: i don't know it came across as yeah 

557.43 562.46 A: i then ran across a few people that has type of attitude that doesn't really care if they 

562.03 563.86 B: yeah 

562.65 565.58 A: you know well i'm gonna die with something type attitude 

565.13 567.06 B: yeah 

565.93 573.06 A: may it be overweight may it be me not eating enough may it be me smoking may it be you know 

573.53 575.38 B: yeah 

574.02 575.88 A: you know alcohol or 

575.95 583.48 A: you know stuff like that but they gotta stand back and realize that other people wouldn't say anything if they didn't care [noise] 

577.19 578.68 B: and they don't care huh 

583.17 585.62 B: (( yeah yeah i know )) 

586.32 589.46 A: so that's when it really is and is 

589.46 590.73 B: yeah and 

589.47 596.38 A: i guess you gotta have a open mind to everything or things don't seem to pan out 

596.67 597.95 B: yeah 

597.03 599.89 A: 'cause if you just have that attitude where oh well i'm sm-
