223.73 225.18 B: i don't either 

224.60 228.72 A: i mean if you're gonna talk you should at least know what the hell you're talking about i it's 

227.93 229.64 B: that's exactly right 

229.11 242.32 A: [laughter] and if you don't know i mean and hearsay and saying oh well so and so did this and so and so did that i i figure all that does is mess up with other people's lives you know 'cause you usually don't te- you ain't telling the truth either 

242.14 249.47 B: well uh one of my favorite expressions is don't talk l- d- don't like an expert on something you don't know a damn thing about 

243.34 244.36 A: (( [sigh] )) 

248.90 251.30 A: (( exactly yes )) 

249.72 251.93 B: [laughter] 

251.47 257.38 A: and and i'm a very straight forward person you know so basically you know 

252.45 253.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

257.41 265.48 A: i've had people gossip about me because it's like if you ask me w- how you look i will tell you truth whether it's you look good or you look like shit you know 

264.78 269.05 B: well in other words uh if you don't want the truth uh don't ask you huh 

265.74 266.84 A: [laughter] 

267.73 270.01 A: d- exactly 

269.48 271.44 B: that that's the way my wife was 

271.01 284.30 A: [laughter] 'cause it's like i'd rather be told the truth than have let's say oh you look so cute and you go out looking like a dork you know it's like tell me tell me what you really think or don't say a word you know [laughter] and so 

277.93 279.77 B: right right [laughter] 

284.60 293.40 A: and i never really got into those little girlie clicks where they did all that gossiping and chattering and stuff 'cause i just found it really annoying so 

289.31 290.34 B: yeah 

294.07 296.58 A: i guess out of the whole list of 

297.55 301.13 A: weird things she gave us that would probably be the worst thing [noise] 

300.49 304.78 B: i don't i don't think really that i have ever been a gossiper uh 

305.56 308.66 B: i guess i have really heard more gossip since
