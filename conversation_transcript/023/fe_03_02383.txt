36.00 37.32 A: so do you hate 

38.18 41.95 B: i would put in a vote for gossiping [laughter] 

40.98 45.66 A: you're going to vote for gossiping because you like over eating and smoking caffeine and not going to the gym 

45.21 49.48 B: [laughter] or [cough] i think we're supposed to rate ah 

49.50 53.08 B: ah what is worse in terms of ah 

53.55 58.76 B: i guess wh- wh- well i guess we start by putting in our own votes and that's my vote what is your vote [laughter] 

58.13 63.33 A: your vote's for gossiping what about smoking i think smoking is the filthiest of the habits i think was that in there 

63.71 64.97 B: yeah it was 

65.01 66.13 A: yeah that one's 

66.29 68.11 A: (( david i think )) 

68.51 71.01 A: ah but that's just me i guess i don't know 

71.49 72.45 B: okay 

71.97 76.33 A: (( wh- why do you think gossiping is worse than um than smoking or )) 

77.43 78.35 B: um 

78.64 84.67 B: well i just thought i mean i i understood the question is to me it like sounds like a values question so 

84.68 93.05 B: ah to me it seems that i think that all other four or five things ah that they listed i think that those are things that i think you can 

92.92 101.30 B: turn around um and i think that they are less likely to have an effect on other people but i think that gossiping is is you know it's ah 

101.81 107.27 B: it's ah it's ah a problem of mortals and um 

107.33 112.14 B: i mean you can you can obviously stop gossiping but once you've done it you've done it you 

111.94 122.27 B: if you hurt someone in the process you can't really turn that around um you really only hurt yourself if you're smoking unless you know breathing your second hand smoke in someone else's face but [laughter] 

122.06 131.73 B: you're only hurting yourself if you don't go the gym if you don't eat and stuff like that so that's why i think i say that i think those are things that you can self improve on and you can obviously self improve on your 

125.67 126.56 A: yeah 

131.58 139.59 B: ah gossiping habit but if you hurt people all the way um i think that that is something that's very hard to uproot 

139.55 144.05 A: yeah but how does gossiping really hurt somebody i mean except unless you're drawing attention 

146.70 147.60 B: (( well )) 

147.95 161.32 B: i think i think you can hurt someone because you're if you're spreading something that you're not sure is is true about someone or if you're spreading something that someone wanted them wanted something to keep them they wanted to keep it private you know they have a right to privacy 

161.31 171.62 B: and if you're going around behind their back without asking them um then that's wrong [laughter] that's my own that's my own moral judgment ah but um 

171.94 177.01 B: i think i i mean i can't say that i'm a hundred percent ah innocent of ah 

176.78 181.57 B: of of that of that thing i think that i i think i do it all the time but [laughter] 

177.85 179.25 A: (( [laughter] [cough] at )) 

181.56 193.42 B: or i think that ah i i think that this world is based on gossip the entire media is top gossip the entire media ah industry would be out of business um 

193.50 197.90 A: least the star and the enquirer would be [laughter] if nothing else 

197.75 199.56 B: definitely 

200.12 205.37 A: i don't i mean i guess some of the substance of these habits are more offensive to me because they 

205.60 209.01 A: are forced on our society as well right 

208.59 216.44 B: yes definitely i mean yeah i think that i think th- the other thing that were mentioned were definitely are also a- are bad things [laughter] 

216.33 228.04 A: you can say that over eating and not going to the gym only affects yourself but if you're dependent on society to take care of you if you've had a heart attack and been in a coma for twenty years then you can say yeah that's affecting other people 

228.03 232.67 B: right and if you're dependent on on drugs um i 

232.98 244.19 B: don't know if that was one i don't know well i i guess smoking in a sense is a drug yeah but if you're depended on on that ah right you aren't doing anything good for society 

233.09 233.82 A: (( yeah )) 

234.98 237.06 A: i mean it should be in there 

244.61 245.71 B: um 

244.97 246.75 A: in general is bad because 

246.76 250.28 A: support yourself and you become a welfare case or something along those lines 

250.85 252.30 A: and ah then 

254.53 255.46 B: right 

254.80 258.13 A: got it at some point i don't know what happened there 

258.98 259.96 B: (( [laughter] )) 

260.41 263.78 A: but i don't know i mean i guess it's despicable habits 

264.35 265.75 A: or bad habits 

265.87 269.79 A: i mean i guess i don't go to the gym per se and i'm over weight and so i should be 

270.10 273.70 A: taking care of those that's pretty despicable i guess as well 

273.89 274.96 B: [laughter] 

274.46 275.52 A: i don't know 

276.88 291.56 B: i think it's i don't think it's despicable not to go the gym i think that's like a personal decision that people make um but i think it's just it's a matter of you know what you value in terms of wh- wh- what you spend your time on doing 

291.50 292.47 B: um 

295.01 300.98 A: my wife is completely clueless she's now walking away from me ah she's seen me look at that 

300.72 301.67 B: [laughter] 

301.53 303.91 A: beautiful just picking her up at the train here 

303.96 305.64 B: [laughter] 

304.47 309.47 A: so how about all that for another bad habit picking your wife up off the train that's a fine habit actually [laughter] 

309.35 310.28 B: [laughter] 

310.35 311.13 A: (( but ah )) 

311.53 314.34 A: i i wonder what they're trying to ask us 

315.78 316.54 A: though 

318.89 319.71 B: (( that's )) 

322.17 324.68 A: (( but ah i don't know wife )) 

327.70 328.66 A: (( in the )) 

330.01 335.47 A: (( car [noise] )) 

337.46 338.42 A: hello 

340.08 341.01 A: (( hello )) 

341.04 342.18 B: (( good hi )) 

344.83 350.79 B: hi my name is david i'm doing a i'm we're participating in like ah in a study [laughter] 

355.71 369.50 B: [noise] we're talking about the question was what is what do you va- what do do you think is the worst the and the answers were smoking gossiping over eating not going to the gym ah 

369.67 374.31 B: or i think drinking alcohol ah obsessively 

375.18 376.22 A: (( smoking because )) 

377.18 378.01 B: okay 

378.21 382.70 A: it is it can other people's health not health not just your own 

384.42 389.64 B: right i said i said gossiping because i felt that gossiping was ah 

389.60 397.35 B: was something that can get it can get def- i felt that all the other things that i i saw it as kind of like a values question and all the other things that were listed 

397.16 406.05 B: were things that ah i think that you can improve on yourself but that gossiping was something that once you did it you kind of already you you you can't really 

406.08 419.00 B: fix it i mean like once you've gossiped about someone if they find out it can hurt them and you can't really turn around it's almost like it almost sounded like a question of whether gossiping didn't really fit in [laughter] with all the with all the rest of the answers 

419.85 425.82 A: (( well if somebody smokes around you and you have asthma and you have an asthma attack and die i don't think they can turn around and change that either )) 

426.65 429.68 B: what did you say i'm sorry i didn't quite catch it all 

428.52 434.06 A: (( i said if somebody smokes around you and you're allergic to it and have asthma and you have an asthma attack and die )) 

434.16 446.33 A: (( i don't think that they can turn around and change that either i think that's a little bit worse than if somebody gossips about i i think i'd rather somebody gossip about me than kill me through smoking near me )) 

437.17 438.43 B: no they ah 

446.67 460.39 B: yeah i would agree with that or or or i mean in that or on the other case you know if someone's drinking obsessively and they get into your drunk driving accident that's also definitely horrible yeah it takes its toll on people ah 

455.49 456.39 A: right 

460.19 466.63 A: right but we live in new york city so i'm more likely to be near an inconsiderate person that's smoking near me than 

467.17 469.64 A: (( you know driving drunk )) 

469.06 471.08 B: yeah 

473.76 475.61 B: yeah 

482.36 488.32 B: [noise] i think we've exhausted this question [laughter] we have to wait we have to wait till the study cuts us off now 

485.24 486.07 A: (( probably )) 

493.45 495.55 A: (( and also there's a lot of ah a )) 

495.76 500.96 A: (( lot more cases of children with asthma because of kids that smoke or parents that smoke )) 

500.93 513.85 B: mhm yeah right i also i also live in the new york city area and it's nice now that they at least that they're trying to keep like restaurants and bars and stuff with this non smoking ban i don't know how well they're upholding it but 

513.55 516.60 A: (( right i wish they would just do it outside )) 

516.91 518.51 B: yeah 

516.97 518.40 A: (( outside of buildings )) 

518.70 524.73 B: yeah that also creates a problem for people that live around that area i mean if you live up up like you live 

524.91 531.50 B: above a bar or something like that or above a restaurant people are walking outside and now you have people that are polluting the outdoors so 

531.64 539.15 B: um it doesn't really solve the it solves the problem inside the place it doesn't solve it outside where people that are want to keep their environment clean 

539.08 540.93 A: mhm 

542.65 545.49 A: (( so how long does it take for this study to cut off )) 

544.74 550.16 B: [laughter] um it should be an- it should be like in thirty seconds or so i think 

554.29 555.60 A: (( [laughter] oh [noise] )) 

562.28 563.24 A: so did 

563.27 564.60 A: they call you

567.95 578.40 B: like it's like both me and your husband ah signed up for it and it like automatically calls ah the ah like a computerized operator 

578.43 579.78 A: mhm 

579.43 589.87 B: mm and then you get paid [laughter] yeah i don't i don't understand i don't know what the purpose is i don't know they're doing something in terms of like people talking on the telephone 

582.16 583.74 A: (( oh interesting )) 

589.78 592.23 A: (( how much is the payment oh ten )) 

593.14 599.89 B: yeah i don't know it doesn't they change the topic like ev- is not clear like what exactly they're trying to study
