34.48 42.71 A: well as far as i'm 'cause i just got my email today that said you will be called but i didn't know they were gonna do it one minute after four [laughter] 

41.97 49.21 B: well you know you can call in uh 'cause this is my third call and i like you know it's too much just to sit and wait 

49.17 50.39 A: yeah 

49.55 57.44 B: so you can call in and you put your pin number in and get the call and you don't have to wait for the calls like you do it when it's convenient for you 

56.94 60.72 A: oh is that what they meant about you can do three calls what a day or 

60.46 63.97 B: i i guess you could do them all in one day u- 

63.99 66.88 B: um i don't know if three is the limit 

66.43 67.63 A: (( oh okay )) 

67.21 75.38 B: you know but they did say three but then i hear some people like if you look in those forums some people are getting six calls a day 

74.64 82.26 A: yeah i have to go back in there today and check it out some more well as far as the topic today i'm pretty much i have all those bad habits 

81.89 83.24 B: i do too

88.89 90.91 A: i don't gossip though i 

90.00 97.44 B: that's right that's what i was gonna say that's the only thing that i really and truly don't do is gossip but i do smoke i 

94.74 96.04 A: yeah 

96.65 98.14 A: yeah 

97.46 98.42 B: do you know 

98.61 99.68 B: um 

100.04 110.42 B: very bad at exercising i was great when i was younger but i just kinda got out of it you get too you get so busy and you're just too tired i don't wanna do it

113.20 124.75 A: argh [laughter] but i guess i guess i should exercise but as as far as gossiping and i'm the type of person if you stay out of bus- my business i stay out of yours if it doesn't concern me or my family or 

121.60 123.18 B: (( that's how i )) 

124.88 128.24 A: you know then i really [laughter] don't wanna hear about it 

127.18 136.70 B: am that's how i am and i guess probably i would probably think that smoking is probably the worst out of all the habits because we know 

136.74 138.41 B: as we're smoking 

138.95 146.73 B: you know what it's doing to us you know i mean you can't really deny it any longer when i was a kid and i started smoking

259.79 260.81 A: mhm 

260.42 271.85 B: because i would blow up i'd be in the middle of a happy conversation laughing and all of a sudden i'd get mad and i didn't know why i was mad but whoever i was talking to i'd get real snippy with

323.68 325.15 B: (( isn't that something )) 

324.23 330.98 A: it was the idea that oh god i i survived a heart attack you know and [laughter] i'm just gonna keep on living 

330.67 332.28 B: (( yeah the wow )) 

331.10 335.58 A: the doctor even said to me he doesn't realize why why i'm even still here 

337.57 343.85 A: and i'm like i don't know either i guess i'm just either strong willed or or there's somebody up there watching over me but uh 

344.50 346.16 A: but i have no clue 

345.82 347.80 B: do you smoke a lot 

347.35 358.70 A: um you know what i say no but uh uh being a smoker i say no because i if i'm sitting around i'll light one up and then get up to do something and come back to it and it's burned out 

357.95 360.76 B: yeah yeah yeah yeah 

359.04 372.68 A: so i don't know truthfully how much i smoke a day i can't say a pack or two packs i may start up my second pack in the middle of the evening but i really haven't sat down and smoked the whole pack

389.69 392.04 A: ugh but then i just go right back to it again 

391.71 402.97 B: yeah i was starting to get where it was actually skeeving me i could smell it on myself all the time i could smell it when i walked in my house i could smell it in my clothes closet 

401.40 403.92 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

402.98 408.52 B: and it was driving me nuts and i think that's what gave me the incentive to stop 

408.54 415.90 B: but now that i have started again i don't smell it any more it it doesn't skeeve me any more [laughter] 

411.57 412.70 A: mhm
