0.18 1.98 B: hi i'm christina 

2.87 4.76 A: uh hi i'm ryan 

5.65 7.16 B: (( hi [laughter] )) 

7.44 9.44 A: ha- have you done this before 

9.16 14.62 B: yeah this is actually only my second time so i'm not so good on it yet but [laughter] 

11.34 12.16 A: oh i 

13.65 17.02 A: this will be the first time so i'll be less than good at it 

15.04 16.17 B: oh okay 

16.42 21.75 B: oh okay well um pretty much i guess we just have to answer the question um 

22.21 32.91 B: so the question was do you get sick between seasons [mn] [laughter] well i actually live in l._a. so i'm going to have to say no because we have no real seasons 

30.17 31.60 A: oh probably not 

32.85 34.69 A: absolutely i uh 

34.03 35.38 B: right 

34.49 41.12 A: i used to live in uh in sacramento and where the weather was kind of similar there too the [laughter] 

37.12 38.12 B: uh-huh 

40.91 50.90 A: difference between seasons was there was nothing there was nothing at all i'm uh i'm in missouri now and we definitely have a difference in seasons we can go from 

41.14 42.18 B: right 

44.14 45.10 B: right 

49.99 50.88 B: uh-huh 

50.99 61.13 A: you know a wind chill of sixty below in the winter to a hundred and ten degrees and high humidity in the summer so i i think the uh 

55.83 56.39 B: (( [cough] )) 

58.90 59.92 B: right 

61.92 69.19 A: there are quite a few people you know who a a bugs definitely go around when the weather changes and 

67.00 68.06 B: mhm 

68.60 69.55 B: mhm 

69.49 74.44 A: i think i'm susceptible to it a little bit but um it doesn't seem to 

74.77 79.98 A: wel knock me out as as much as it as it seems to knock out other people [mn] 

79.72 85.83 B: right um i used to live in philadelphia i went to college in philly at penn actually and um 

86.18 91.10 B: um i used to get sick when i first moved there um because the seasons 

90.97 102.09 B: where i'm from aren't really so pronounced so when i first moved to philadelphia like we had definite like definite wi- winter versus summer versus fall like everything was 

101.94 109.99 B: very clear cut as to which season you're in when i first moved there i got sick a lot but then like i guess my body just got used to it um 

110.08 118.00 B: but as far as like treatments go i guess i take a lot more vitamin c. than i used to before i moved to philadelphia and then um 

118.06 130.03 B: every now and then i take echinacea when i start to feel a little bit sick even if it's not just like a winter like a seasonal change if i just start to feel sick i take take echinacea and like i i very rarely get sick anymore 

123.94 124.82 A: uh-huh 

129.79 131.03 A: (( really [mn] )) 

130.58 139.02 B: right knock on wood [laughter] but but yeah i i i i haven't gone to the doctor in a very long time 

132.40 133.68 A: [laughter] 

138.77 139.75 A: wow 

139.57 141.28 B: yeah 

140.59 144.37 A: well it in and uh you bring up a good point and i wonder if 

143.25 144.15 B: mhm 

144.54 155.21 A: you you mention that that when you first moved out there to philadelphia where the seasons change that you seemed to be more susceptible to it i i you know i wonder if it's something that your body has to uh 

147.73 148.61 B: uh-huh 

150.05 151.45 B: right 

155.07 158.31 A: has to get used to those dramatic changes and if you 

158.12 172.62 A: you know i was born and raised in missouri and my body was a little bit more used to the dramatic changes so it doesn't hit me as hard as it might necessarily hit someone who is from arizona california somewhere like that where the seasons don't change and they get thrown into the middle of 

162.88 163.87 B: (( mhm )) 

170.01 170.96 B: right 

172.55 176.01 B: right yeah i i've definitely believe that um 

176.50 181.94 B: it's just like your body can only take so much you know like it has to adapt to certain 

182.45 195.22 B: situations and then when you when you suddenly change your body isn't ready for it and then that's when you really get sick but i think that like once you've lived for in somewhere for more than a year like your body d- has chan- s- like 

195.14 203.56 B: it's definitely so called evolved i guess to to whatever climate you're in like right now like right what 

197.59 198.40 A: (( it right )) 

201.07 202.49 A: you talked about 

203.29 204.86 A: go go ahead 

204.45 207.39 B: oh i mean like now i i've moved to l._a. and like 

207.52 214.43 B: i mean l._a. compared to philly uh to philly like there really isn't a comparison for for um 

215.07 223.32 B: differences in climate it's like l._a. never changes it's always sunny it's always between like fifty and seventy [laughter] 

216.31 217.25 A: yeah 

221.63 222.62 A: [laughter] i w- 

223.08 225.99 A: i was oddly enough in los angeles yesterday 

225.70 228.43 B: (( oh were you really [laughter] )) 

226.37 230.23 A: yeah and it was very nice it was very lovely 

229.09 230.30 B: [laughter] 

230.07 237.96 B: [laughter] yeah it's great here and i uh like the worst that will happen to me is i might sneeze [laughter] and that's it um 

235.11 238.73 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

237.87 245.86 B: [laughter] but i'm sure right now i i've been living here for almost a year and i just feel like maybe like if i moved back to philly at this point i'd probably get sick again 

245.67 254.17 A: absolutely absolutely you you mentioned that you you take more vitamin c. or when you feel like you're you're getting sick you take echinacea 

247.57 248.82 B: right 

252.67 253.74 B: mhm 

254.25 257.86 A: i i don't do that and and uh 

256.79 257.67 B: mhm 

258.56 267.03 A: and probably to a fault and and i i think what happens with me is that i don't get sick often but when i do 

266.90 267.89 B: mhm 

267.26 276.24 A: i get sick i mean you know it really knocks me out and and i probably ought to do more preventative things to 

268.73 269.95 B: really 

271.27 272.17 B: right 

275.72 276.79 B: mhm 

276.08 286.73 A: keep it from happening because when it does when it does happen it's rare and it knocks me out but you know i guess and and i don't know if it's like if it's a 

287.39 291.20 A: manly thing thinking oh i'll be fine i can just you know i can 

291.14 302.74 A: beat this cold i can you know i can wait it out i don't need any of that stuff but uh you know they've they've come to me four days later when i'm curled up in bed and [laughter] i'm a little less manly my [mn] 

292.36 293.53 B: uh-huh 

294.15 296.61 B: [laughter] 

299.40 301.33 B: [laughter] 

302.18 306.48 B: (( [laughter] no i want my mommy [laughter] )) 

304.00 311.28 A: my wife my wife has certainly called me a great big baby so i prob- i probably ought to do more preventative things 

307.68 309.46 B: [laughter] 

310.89 318.66 B: [laughter] right um i don't know how well echinacea actually works like i've been reading studies lately where they just have 

312.23 312.79 A: (( [cough] )) 

315.97 316.75 A: yeah 

318.57 321.43 B: that pretty much uh like echinacea does not work 

321.01 321.99 A: right 

321.34 327.84 B: but i mean as far a- i used to be a psych major and do i used to do a lot of like research and stuff like that and 

325.20 326.49 A: uh-huh uh-huh [cough] 

327.74 333.06 B: as far as i'm aware like if you can convince yourself that it's working it'll work 

332.76 333.71 A: so 

332.94 345.95 B: you know like that's why they have placebo studies to prove that it happens and uh it to- it totally does if you think that something's helping you you you're body will do it [laughter] right so i'll i'll look into you taking it up and telling that it works 

333.78 334.94 A: oh yeah 

341.30 342.38 A: (( absolutely )) 

345.72 352.46 A: [laughter] yeah it's whatever works for you and and you know i i wonder if because 

346.43 348.75 B: it's my cure all for diseases 

349.56 350.41 B: right 

352.31 358.89 A: uh that's not something that that i think people talk a lot about here you know echinacea or the 

357.58 358.49 B: (( mm )) 

358.68 371.53 A: i don't want to necessarily call them alternative medicines because i think your herbal remedies are certainly becoming more and more mainstream but it seemed like that really was a california thing in the year and a half that i lived in sacramento um 

364.13 365.14 B: right 

371.59 382.71 A: you know you'd go to john but you saw whatever and get you know an extra boost of whatever in your in your in your juice or in your treat or whatever and it it seems like it's it's 

374.40 376.10 B: mhm 

379.67 380.81 B: right 

382.76 390.55 A: a little bit more accepted a- at least in california was than it is here in the conservative midwest 

389.50 390.47 B: uh-huh 

390.92 391.84 A: (( i don't know )) 

391.09 393.02 B: but do you take vitamins and stuff 

393.27 397.79 B: or do you just completely unlike that kind of stuff [laughter] 

395.41 402.18 A: [mn] [laughter] no i don't [laughter] it's a wonder i'm not walking 

397.93 400.23 B: [laughter] 

402.24 404.30 A: dead all the time but 

403.21 406.36 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

404.35 415.37 A: you i i've vitamins here you know i'm i- i- societally speaking here in the mid west are certainly well accepted and that sort of thing but it just seems to me that that 

412.83 413.78 B: uh-huh 

415.27 423.50 A: in the time that that we were in california it seemed like there was a lot more wider acceptance of you know d- 

423.69 437.72 A: doing not necessarily having to rely on a doctor to make you feel better and which i think is a good thing you know y- y- you don't necessarily have to go to the doctor all the time and s- sometimes there are 

427.39 428.39 B: uh-huh 

429.00 430.03 B: right 

430.98 431.95 B: mhm 

437.87 445.49 A: there are things that you can try things that you can do and like you said if they work for you then by golly keep doing 

441.02 441.88 B: right 

442.78 443.64 B: right 

445.23 452.78 B: right and then as far as like the doctor thing like i never had an h._m._o. i always had a p._p._o. until i started working after college 

451.95 453.34 A: (( 'em uh-huh )) 

452.65 456.78 B: and so then i have an h._m._o. and i avoid going to the doctor 

455.68 457.34 A: [laughter] 

456.56 464.41 B: like if i feel sick i want to fix it myself because first you have to pay for your primary care physician because like 

459.90 460.65 A: yeah 

464.26 475.61 B: i mean like i can go off for hours on h._m._o.s but like you have to have a primary care physician and then most likely he'll either say oh there's nothing wrong with you go home or he'll say okay you need to see someone else and you have to pay for that other person too 

466.39 467.50 A: [laughter] 

471.89 472.79 A: yeah 

475.21 476.09 A: yeah 

475.43 479.69 B: you know i'm like i just feel like if i if there's anything else that i can do 

479.46 492.68 B: i will try it before i go to the doctor and if i'm like throwing up and like totally sick two weeks later then i'll consider going to the doctor [laughter] but until until i run out of options over the counter or whatever like 

481.15 482.56 A: [laughter] 

492.49 500.99 B: herbal remedies i will go to chinese shops and eat like snakeskin i don't care [laughter] anything to not have to go to the doctor 

494.80 496.51 A: [laughter] 

496.84 498.06 A: [laughter] 

498.55 499.72 A: (( that's right )) 

500.53 504.83 A: (( you'll try acupuncture you'll try cats you'll try anything [laughter] )) 

501.80 512.68 B: exactly [laughter] i could have appendicitis i wouldn't care [laughter] [laughter] but yeah i mean it's definitely 

507.39 509.06 A: [laughter] 

513.13 514.69 B: getting sick is not 

515.11 525.08 B: not really an issue to me anymore so um but back when i was in school i used to go to student health all the time like if i got a cough that was funny i'd go to student health 

517.14 518.11 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

524.67 525.60 A: uh-huh 

525.78 531.63 B: but um generally i would have worse colds there than i would here 

531.41 533.22 A: yeah and 

533.66 534.56 B: yeah 

534.20 547.03 A: it it [mn] and and i know the you know the the science uh supposedly says that it really doesn't matter if it's hot outside or if it's cold outside you get a cold because you're transferring a virus from you know 

546.83 547.76 B: (( mm )) 

546.91 550.19 A: one person to the next but you know you 

550.20 555.54 A: you've you've lived in los angeles you've lived in places where the weather changes you 

554.77 555.71 B: right 

555.76 564.00 A: [mn] certainly for you it it seems as though there there is a difference when it comes to your health or when it comes to your body being able to adjust 

563.61 568.57 B: right absolutely i i've definitely seen that as a defence um 

569.18 583.50 B: i don't actually know anybody whose been getting sick here but back in philly like we used to get sick all the time but i also don't know if it has to do with the fact that we were in a college atmosphere where everything was being transmitted and like you would sit in a class room with people just like 

577.96 579.91 A: oh that's very good 

580.87 581.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

583.39 592.10 B: coughing and being so completely sick but they don't want to miss class you know like i don't know if it's because of the weather necessarily or it's because of that um 

586.63 587.54 A: yeah 

589.04 589.97 A: yeah 

590.81 592.92 A: that's an excellent point 

592.59 597.33 B: right so i mean but i also live near u._c._l._a. and i also see a lot of sick people around here 

596.80 597.67 A: uh-huh 

597.71 599.89 B: like i did back in philly but i mean
