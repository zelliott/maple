231.94 232.90 B: yeah 

234.28 241.05 B: i keep up on the news i have the internet so i surf the web and i get like time magazine so 

236.72 237.87 A: oh 

240.42 245.60 A: well to my mind if you have a computer that's more than having a television 

245.35 246.59 B: yeah i like 

245.89 247.89 A: because you're hooked up to the world 

247.67 248.96 B: yep 

248.30 261.02 A: yeah and you can watch the television by watching d._v._d.'s or you can download a movie and watch it so that's like having a t._v. you can download radio stations t._v. stations and watch what's going on 

261.01 261.94 B: yeah 

261.34 263.83 A: yeah so you do have a television

284.18 285.44 A: okay 

285.02 286.43 B: yeah 

285.82 290.37 A: okay but it can be healthy because you know when we talk about people who are

421.09 422.14 B: yeah 

421.58 430.16 A: many people over eat because they're nervous or they're stressed out about a certain issue and that's the only way they know they can relieve themselves you know 

430.00 431.16 B: yeah 

430.56 432.87 A: by turning to something that won't complain 

432.98 434.30 B: yeah 

433.51 436.64 A: and nobody can stop them from eating unless they want to stop 

436.77 437.94 B: that's true
