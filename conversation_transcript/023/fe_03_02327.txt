0.01 1.72 B: hi it's ivan 

1.76 3.06 A: uh simon 

2.71 3.60 B: (( ivan )) 

3.59 5.49 A: ivan hi i'm alison 

5.09 7.23 B: hi alison [laughter] [noise] 

6.71 8.89 A: okay we're supposed to talk about um 

9.30 10.56 B: illness right 

9.95 15.71 A: illnesses and was it something about uh change in the seasons and people becoming sick 

15.26 18.69 B: right right uh that many people believe that happens 

19.05 20.18 B: um 

20.23 21.85 B: what do you think [laughter] 

21.61 26.13 A: yeah i i i think so but i think it's mostly in the spring because of um 

27.03 30.47 A: you know the allergies and stuff like that i'm in texas and 

30.61 31.82 B: oh really mhm 

31.02 37.94 A: i- it gets really really bad over here in terms of the um pollen and stuff like that but other than 

37.98 47.90 A: um allergies and things like that i think people say that if when it gets really cold or really warm very quickly that for some reason they get ill i've never understood that myself 

47.71 51.72 B: well um is the weather over there kind of temperate i mean 

51.68 54.75 A: yeah texas is very um it's very 

51.84 52.64 B: mean 

54.76 59.39 A: unpredictable um in terms of getting hot and cold really quickly 

58.96 62.33 B: right right oh we here it's uh 

62.49 67.16 B: i live in new york and the weather's always kind of bad [laughter] 

66.98 68.38 A: [laughter] 

67.21 71.38 B: especially during the winter and stuff so most of the time people get sick during the winter when winter comes 

71.25 72.21 A: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

71.63 80.04 B: uh whe- and we tend to have the allergies all year round but we're mostly susceptible to like the flus and the and the viruses and that kind of thing 

79.81 84.41 A: so during the winter does everybody have like um a cold like all the time 

83.89 92.63 B: all the time um especially as there's so many of us you know jammed together so if you went on the train to work you know you're pretty much close to everything 

92.77 96.28 A: so do do people just have constant colds for like four months out of the year 

95.63 98.61 B: yeah yeah [laughter] um 

97.42 99.76 A: you would think they'd get used to it after a while 

99.43 108.69 B: you do but l- like a lot of people just like uh like little older people or the younger people and stuff like that they tend to to hold onto a cold and i guess that has to do with diet too 

108.86 117.03 B: um but wha- what was the the other component we had to talk about that saying they said that a cold lasts seven days 

117.25 121.83 B: if you go to a doctor or a week if you don't that kind of thing 

121.44 123.08 A: oh um 

122.76 123.93 B: [laughter] 

124.43 127.48 A: you know a cold is a cold is a cold i i 

127.51 138.93 A: i i don't necessarily have a cold that just lasts seven days you know i've had some that have just lasted for weeks on end but in terms of going to the doctor i don't think i've ever gone to a doctor for a cold specifically 

130.71 131.52 B: right 

138.42 139.28 B: right 

138.75 143.03 A: unless it becomes a sinus infection and then you've got a whole another problem at that juncture 

142.86 147.77 B: right right right i think that's when when you got a cold when you have an allergy too and you get infected that way 

147.62 150.75 A: yeah it happens people have it really bad 

150.08 159.55 B: right you see i used i used to believe that uh if you you get you catch a cold for three days and then you have it for three days and you ge- get rid of it for three days 

151.25 152.31 A: (( so do you keep )) 

159.56 162.68 B: so i thought it usually lasts like nine days the whole thing 

163.03 166.13 A: [mn] and in new york you just catch it again [laughter] [laughter] 

164.87 166.85 B: yeah there you go [laughter] 

166.62 171.81 A: so do you go see the doctor a lot for your colds or since you already know in the winter everyone's going to be sick constantly 

171.33 181.63 B: well yeah we kind of we kind of expect it i mean um people with health insurance go to the doctor and get shots the flu shot but everybody else is like on their own [laughter] yeah 

180.19 182.83 A: [laughter] so do you think generally people 

182.92 187.03 A: on their own do they just suffer through it or what do you think they do about it 

186.91 189.71 B: um you know macwell [laughter] 

189.06 191.25 A: [laughter] macwell over the counter drugs 

190.25 192.61 B: (( we do a lot of macwell here [laughter] )) 

191.99 193.49 A: [laughter] 

192.85 198.86 B: uh and those things you know it's like special teas you get with the the you know over over the counter stuff 

199.19 202.95 B: like uh like uh alka seltzer teas that kind of thing 

199.42 200.28 A: wow 

202.41 207.00 A: so how how often do you think you actually get sick since you live in that kind of climate 

206.66 216.54 B: um well i've been pretty lucky where we i mean i used to get sick about uh maybe three or four times just like a cold like regular stuff um really sick i get 

216.62 225.86 B: maybe like once every few years but i've been i've been pretty lucky i guess of course if you keep your diet up then that has a lot to do with it too or if you clean your hands after you you know 

222.38 223.72 A: (( yeah yeah [mn] )) 

226.08 233.62 B: after everything like even if you go on the subway you know wash your hands afterwards and that kind of thing you know a lot of people forget to do that 

229.83 231.17 A: oh yeah 

233.02 235.49 A: oh yeah yeah and it gets really bad um 

235.47 249.89 A: see with the temperate climate that we have generally we don't get sick that often i mean like having a winter cold i mean in fact i have a winter coat that i think i've worn twice in the past three years yeah you never wear you never wear out your winter coat and then it gets outdated and you have to throw it out but 

243.96 245.29 B: (( yeah really [laughter] mm )) 

249.76 253.96 A: um we don't actually get sick that often here um [mn] 

254.28 259.40 A: it's just again the allergies and right now it's just really really terrible but um 

258.45 261.33 B: mm what do you what do you take for it what do most people [laughter] 

260.05 261.26 A: i'm sorry take 

261.32 274.61 A: well um [laughter] it depends it depends on exactly how bad it is but you know right now just with maybe more pollution and stuff uh my uh home is actually pretty close to a farm area but as 

273.27 275.54 B: right oh wow [laughter] 

274.90 280.85 A: well yeah in texas you can i mean i work for a major corporation but literally i can drive three 

280.95 293.02 A: three or four minutes outside of the corporation past my house and then i'm in the middle of a farm and so but um as it gets more and more polluted that people's allergies act up more and more and so 

286.37 287.28 B: right 

292.96 299.59 A: you know i'm finding myself at one point never having to worry about it and then now taking claratyne and i've gone from that to zyrtec and 

298.12 299.22 B: (( right okay )) 

299.48 307.02 A: um you know it's just kind of gone on and then people around here have to take a lot of sh- allergy shots just because of the the type of illness but 

306.92 311.46 A: i do feel very sorry for folks who have it all the time 

311.22 312.16 B: right 

311.29 323.80 A: like allergies because they're constantly having respiratory infections and constantly going to the doctor and then they're just never well [laughter] it's like it's in in somewhat incapacitated in fact from all that 

318.66 319.75 B: yeah and 

323.43 335.50 B: right and there's a lot of people here who for other who for whatever reason uh they're they're immune system's compromised anyway so they're always they always have some little thing going on and that's kind of uh there's a lot of people like that here 

335.67 342.53 B: you know like i have a few like family members who fall into that category they just always got to you know live with it you know 

343.07 357.31 A: it's unfortunate too because i think i think people's quality of life uh starts to to really suffer i had i had a friend whose um whose husband is not only under like a very type a stressful type of individual but 

343.38 344.66 B: (( seems to me [laughter] )) 

357.48 368.58 A: just is real susceptible i i think you know what's what's what's first the chicken or the egg is it the stress that makes his immune system go down or is it because he's sick and then it causes stress i don't know what the deal is but 

357.54 358.85 B: [laughter] 

362.14 363.02 B: right 

368.44 382.70 A: uh ever since strangely enough ever since they married he ended up he ended up being sick a lot like constantly you know every week he goes to his job he he works really hard he does sixty seventy hours a week and then on the weekends the guy can't get out of bed all weekend 

379.00 380.03 B: (( mhm right )) 

382.08 385.09 B: i think it's the sixty seventy hours a week that's doing that [laughter] so 

384.50 393.49 A: yeah yeah or it's the type of personality or whatever but then you're out of kilter and then he's he's sick all the time and 

388.75 389.82 B: (( right right )) 

393.33 404.12 A: every weekend you know he never makes it to church because he's sick all the time and it's just it's really very unfortunate i think for a lot of folks who who have uh quality of life issues uh 

404.17 405.42 A: with that 

405.19 408.18 B: yeah but if you know what's the alternative [laughter] 

407.70 410.00 A: yeah what's the alternative exactly 

408.46 415.38 B: yeah you you live with what you have and hopefully it's just like an allergy or a cold and nothing bad that you know 

415.34 417.03 A: yeah it doesn't get any worse 

415.77 419.09 B: do people near farms get sicker than other people [laughter] 

418.78 419.77 A: (( what did you say )) 

419.32 422.54 B: do people who live near farms do they get sicker than other people mm mm 

421.86 423.04 A: you know what 

423.32 433.15 A: i don't think they necessarily do um because i think in general their lifestyles are so much healthier in terms of getting out getting away from the office air 

433.10 434.10 B: oh okay 

433.19 443.47 A: and and they're used to and i and i think really they're really used to much more difficult conditions that i think it's just a healthier environment i mean that's why farmers can eat 

443.48 452.19 A: you know three eggs and nine pieces of bacon and [laughter] they c- and you know biscuits with lard in it and they can do it day after day after day and then 

445.67 446.84 B: yeah [laughter] 

451.43 453.70 B: probably the atkins diet [laughter] mhm 

453.11 455.51 A: (( um yeah the atkins diet [laughter] )) 

455.40 467.46 A: but and then there there's there's ju- they're just incredibly healthy it's because you know they're out exercising getting fresh air and stuff like that although i guess the d- the downside is that that people who are office workers 

467.23 472.40 A: generally will not get an arm cut off from a tractor [laughter] 

470.17 472.47 B: that's that's true [laughter] 

472.58 476.10 A: they'll just get sick from the poisoned air in the offices [laughter] 

475.39 483.63 B: i wonder if if you if you like you know traded places you know it's like the farmer traded places with the office worker for a while like a week would they get sicker 

483.81 492.45 B: and would the office people get better or would they just be sicker or something like that i wonder if the environment is that much have to do with it or just the constitution you 

493.34 501.82 A: you know i i i've i wonder um i i think that probably the farmer would get more sick in an office environment 

501.97 502.95 A: (( um )) 

503.52 517.83 A: and i think ye- but [laughter] the problem is if you get a bunch of city office workers trying to get on the farm i mean they are most likely they're just going to hurt themselves but [laughter] other than just physical damage to their bodies i think that they probably would be healthier 

517.72 521.54 A: but that's just that's just me having grown up out here 

519.98 520.77 B: (( know really [laughter] mm )) 

521.58 524.99 B: i wonder how much alcohol has to do with uh people getting sick 

524.94 526.72 A: i'm s- how how much what 

526.15 527.91 B: alcohol um 

527.92 534.15 B: like you know people who are hard drinkers if they get sicker than you know what i mean i mean does it do anything 'cause i've heard in new york we hear that if you 

534.34 540.29 B: people who are [mn] alcoholics get less colds actually because their blood is so thin all the time or something like that 

539.69 546.76 A: oh i don't know about that [laughter] sounds like sounds to me that's like an excuse just to have a party 

540.64 542.62 B: yeah [laughter] 

546.25 547.87 B: oh really yeah [laughter] 

546.84 550.35 A: uh i don't know [laughter] but um 

550.52 559.17 A: no i think uh i think probably if you had i think the alcohol generally because it's just going to lead to a poor health healthy const- constitution 

557.73 558.73 B: that's true 

559.14 566.15 A: and you probably going to get worse but then you know they've got all the studies that if you drink what is it if you drink one beer or one 

565.01 567.26 B: (( oh and like one glass of wine yeah mm )) 

566.61 576.26 A: one glass of wine or something like that it's supposed to um not only lower heart disease but there's other diseases it's supposed to lower i don't know what the deal is um and they said there's a 

575.09 579.63 B: so maybe there is something to the if you know helping your blood a little bit 

579.30 580.32 A: i'm sorry 

579.78 584.30 B: maybe there is something to it helping your blood just a little bit you know the alcohol yeah 

583.70 584.70 A: yeah 

585.19 586.83 B: (( maybe [laughter] )) 

586.13 590.37 A: but it but it was on the front page of the wall street journal that if you drink you know you drink something 

590.44 593.61 A: once a day i don't know i don't know but um 

591.33 592.24 B: yeah 

593.62 598.31 A: it doesn't stop me i think i'd have a coors light open right now [laughter] 

596.70 597.96 B: [laughter] 

598.83 599.95 B: oh well that's that's
