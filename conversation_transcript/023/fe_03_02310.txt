0.59 1.88 A: hi 

2.47 3.75 B: hi 

4.08 5.56 A: my name's terry 

5.28 6.87 B: my name is brenda 

6.67 8.84 A: hi brenda how are you today 

8.31 9.75 B: i'm fine and you 

9.62 11.04 A: i'm fine 

10.87 11.95 B: (( good )) 

12.59 26.58 B: um did did they say that [laughter] i'm like maybe i was hearing wrong if you go to the doctor within seven if you don't go to the doctor your cold lasts seven days and only a week if you do is that what they said 

26.08 34.75 A: what they want you to do is i guess talk about what you do personally do when the change of seasons and if when you begin to feel you're ill 

34.24 44.35 B: right right i understand that but i'm like i know they [laughter] didn't say okay [laughter] i'm on drugs [laughter] um 

35.24 36.30 A: right 

45.22 48.10 B: (( i go um i dunno um )) 

47.65 56.30 A: i personally don't get sick from the change of the seasons other than specific illnesses like when there's a high count of pollen 

50.57 51.35 B: (( [mn] )) 

56.22 63.33 A: and i'm my sinuses may act up but then i know it's my sinuses so therefore i usually take over the counter drugs 

58.35 59.38 B: right 

62.82 63.91 B: right 

63.68 76.05 A: so as far as i know some people catch colds when it changes from you know summer to fall or fall to winter winter to spring or they seem to 

76.31 77.96 A: i don't know [sigh] 

77.22 83.55 B: mm right and i are the same way i have i suffer from a lot of allergies and stuff so 

83.56 88.01 B: you know i al- you know when there's a high pollen count like you said um 

88.06 96.10 B: you know i'll start to you know sneeze and everyone thinks no i'm not sick you know its just you know allergies you know [sigh] but i don't tend to 

96.53 101.85 B: get sick like a lot of other people do you know that the regular illnesses 

101.86 105.62 B: the the seasonal colds that you know people seem to 

106.16 108.80 B: catch [laughter] every few months i'm like 

109.07 111.99 B: i i'm feeling fine i know you know 

112.24 117.21 A: i think that people sometimes get colds mainly because of 

117.88 124.74 A: well colds are transferred by not washing hands and things like that and i'm one of those people that 

120.74 121.79 B: (( mhm )) 

125.42 129.41 A: [mn] tries to keep my hands if i know i'm gonna be in a public place and gonna be touching 

129.15 130.16 B: mhm 

129.51 139.88 A: like all the elevator doors or lots of doors or things like that then i'm try to make sure remind myself not to do put my hand near my face until i have a chance to wash them 

139.39 140.49 B: right 

140.55 143.78 B: i carry around the hand sanitizers 

144.58 149.48 A: well hand sanitizers they say can work to a certain extent but they don't work as 

144.73 145.59 B: (( yeah )) 

149.29 152.11 B: well as they as oh well yeah mhm 

149.50 151.83 A: well as they should yeah 

152.00 156.29 A: but you're probably better off keeping the like the little little wipies 

155.98 157.89 B: yeah i have some of those too 

156.80 158.26 A: 'cause they work better 

157.92 162.03 B: mhm yeah i carry those around too 

161.47 171.96 A: but as far as going to the doctor it depends upon it i think what they're looking for is how often when you do have an onset of an illness do you go to the doctor 

168.01 168.87 B: (( mhm okay )) 

171.37 173.29 B: so right away yeah 

172.39 180.83 A: right away or do you wait a week to see if you get better before you go [laughter] to the doctor well i think to me it depends upon exactly what's wrong [laughter] 

173.41 174.33 B: mhm 

175.20 177.85 B: (( mhm right right well )) 

179.67 187.35 B: right you know 'cause going to the doctor you know they're gonna tell you take a couple of aspirins stay in bed drink this and you know 

187.07 192.89 A: well i think it depends upon what you're feeling what the illness is i mean if i have um 

189.38 190.36 B: mhm 

194.93 196.05 A: (( oh i dunno )) 

196.63 210.89 A: trying to think of a specific thing that would make me go to the doctor let's say if i thought i sprained my ankle or my hand or my arm then i probably go to the doctor right away because i know that i'm getting a brace or an x-ray to make sure it's not broken is probably the best 

202.60 204.24 B: oh oh yeah 

210.70 216.86 B: you see that's not an illness that's an injury and that's different you know um 

213.32 215.05 A: right [sigh] 

216.97 219.71 B: and i would hope most people [laughter] 

217.11 218.14 A: um 

218.79 222.10 A: but um when i have come down with cold then [mn] 

222.83 224.25 B: (( [laughter] i know )) 

223.34 232.16 A: it's probably if er uh i do probably wait a week before i go to the doctor in it 'cause i know th- 'cause i feel it's probably a cold and the cold over the counter 

232.22 234.39 A: medications help then 

234.25 235.32 B: mhm 

234.66 241.93 A: i prefer you doing that rather than going to a doctor 'cause i have to go to the doctor get my blood checked on a regular basis anyway so 

237.49 238.55 B: mhm 

241.24 242.80 B: mhm right 

242.99 246.32 B: yeah um i tend to go um 

246.67 248.42 B: i'll only go if 

248.94 262.15 B: instead of getting better it starts to get worse you know and usually if the week wears on it usually starts getting better if it starts getting worse it means i have some kind of other infection it's not just a regular cold it's 

261.05 266.38 A: the only time that i would go to the doctor right away is if my temperature got over two over a hundred and two 

266.37 275.24 B: well yeah you see i would have to go right right about probably before then anyway because my temperature's little bit more than normal anyway 

275.08 276.05 A: mhm 

275.85 283.53 B: so when i [sigh] when it hits like a hundred hundred and one you know it's like i'm i'm usually down for the count anyway 

283.69 284.62 B: so 

283.70 290.98 A: but nowadays with like the sars thing i would probably as soon as i hit a hundred i probably go just to make sure that it that wasn't an issue 

290.65 293.26 B: right right so 

294.03 298.67 B: so well and then um what part of the country do you live in 

298.69 300.23 A: i live on the east coast 

299.86 305.28 B: okay west coast okay so california [laughter] 

305.11 307.42 A: i live in maryland right outside of d._c. 

307.06 308.09 B: okay 

308.21 312.85 B: oh so i guess i guess the coast don't really matter 

312.86 322.90 B: i i think it's just how the person takes care of themselves you know um i drink a lot of fluids i drink lots of juice i drink lots of water 

322.65 336.75 A: i don't drink as much juice i do drink a lot of water and i do drink a lot of tea so um i always have something and i'm drinking all day long but it's normally either hot tea or iced tea or water and then its usually unsweetened tea it's not sweetened 

329.91 330.82 B: mhm 

332.50 333.41 B: mhm 

336.59 337.46 B: mhm 

336.76 340.57 A: but um i drink juice once in a while but i'm just 

341.06 351.80 A: not one of those people that go out and buy juice to drink juice [laughter] usually the time i drink juice or something like that is what usually you know when i'm out for breakfast or something like that 

344.03 346.03 B: [laughter] well 

350.56 359.32 B: right right yeah well i i drink juices you know i try to get you know the one hundred percent juices 

359.41 369.49 B: because i don't like a lot of the fruits you know to to bite into some of the fruits and you know bananas apples [mn] strawberries um you know [laughter] living in calif- 

368.41 377.83 A: yeah i love fruit but i also like i also take um multi vitamins so that i get my vitamins that way rather than rather than um 

373.31 374.31 B: right 

377.55 378.65 B: yeah 

377.97 379.72 A: drinking the fluids or 

379.24 380.57 B: mhm 

379.92 381.39 A: um but i eat 

381.78 386.67 A: eat a pretty good variety of um vegetables and things like that anyway so 

384.72 388.97 B: mhm mhm yeah vegetables are another story i eat meat 

389.28 391.97 B: you either have no vegetables 

392.69 398.66 B: but uh but i don't hate vitamins i i every time i try to take vitamins you know 

398.68 409.12 B: you know they say you should try for a couple of weeks you know to get your body acclimated but even then you know i just i i seem to get more groggy or tired or something 

409.22 410.69 B: so i i 

409.77 418.68 A: maybe the type of vitamin that you're taking is um trying to get it out of your system you might believe it or not you might wanna try just taking a child's chewable 

411.96 413.75 B: well i try dif- 

418.78 420.42 B: mm mm 

420.49 422.86 B: never thought of that yeah 

422.19 426.51 A: because sometimes that it is it it they they dissolve a little bit quicker 

426.32 427.24 B: uh-huh 

426.75 439.72 A: and they're mor- and even just that little even if you don't take the full amount even if you only taking lets say sixty percent requirement or fifty percent requirement of your daily doses it still helps 

437.48 438.51 B: mhm 

439.33 441.62 B: right right mhm 

441.69 446.57 B: yeah i just every time you know i just always switch up and i take 

446.70 459.03 B: um like you know what and then i go you know then i go for my check ups 'cause you know after you get a certain age you know you should go [laughter] and i go and get blood work done yearly and you know 

459.84 466.72 B: i'm fine you know [laughter] my all my blood levels and you know protein um 

467.08 471.37 B: iron and all that is where they're supposed to be for someone my age 

471.45 478.04 B: and so i'm like well i guess i don't need vitamins [laughter] anyway somewhere i'm getting what i need you know but um 

476.81 477.86 A: right 

477.89 479.01 A: (( how old are you )) 

479.11 480.26 B: forty three 

480.36 481.39 A: [laughter] 

481.10 482.13 B: (( why )) 

482.41 483.73 A: ah i'm fifty 

483.77 485.20 B: oh okay 

485.01 486.87 A: [laughter] 

485.49 486.50 B: oh 

486.55 494.81 B: well because i've been talking to so younger kids you know so i feel better now [laughter] oh dear 

488.42 490.97 A: [laughter] 

491.54 493.53 A: [laughter] 

493.81 500.07 A: i was gonna say you're making me you make you make yourself sound so old and i'm thinking well she can't be any older than i am 

499.60 503.64 B: well no well because i was talking to like twenty year olds you 

503.70 506.04 A: over the last last couple of times 

503.91 504.61 B: (( know )) 

505.42 506.39 B: (( uh-huh )) 

506.39 516.59 B: yeah and i'm like okay i feel you know i feel every one of these grey hairs [laughter] now but yeah but yeah um so after you know turn forty you know 

510.62 512.50 A: [laughter] 

516.36 525.28 B: well i even before then i you know i'd been getting regular blood check ups you know because you know being a black woman too you know you you know you 

520.94 521.69 A: mhm 

525.46 526.92 B: you just have to 

528.15 529.05 B: you just 

528.17 541.64 A: i always have to get blood checks because i have other issues i have um thyroid problems and diabetes so i have those those those issues that's the reason why i probably don't enjoy the juice because of of the sweetness and stuff so 

533.59 534.55 B: right 

540.97 551.03 B: oh okay yeah yeah diabetes runs in my family and that's when i you know why i make sure i get that tested you know yearly and things 

548.79 549.65 A: right 

550.35 563.24 A: but i think what they want to talk about is is like the getting back to the issues is how long you know so but you you wait you wait the week or unless you're you reach a certain temperature or something like that 

552.16 552.91 B: oh 

554.56 555.29 B: (( mhm )) 

562.99 566.72 B: well well no i don't wait the week you know it um 

567.39 571.27 B: because i'll usually know within a couple of days you know 

571.60 576.70 B: which way its going you know and usually if its 

572.69 573.84 A: right 

576.74 578.97 B: not cleared up in a couple of days 

579.00 584.31 B: then something else is wrong and i need to get myself [laughter] to the doctor so 

584.87 587.28 B: because the one time i waited 

587.92 593.64 B: gosh i waited it was when one of those flus was going around i was like the last person to get it 

594.06 595.51 B: (( and [sigh] )) 

595.85 599.89 B: i waited almost two weeks or something and
