2.39 3.50 A: hello 

3.36 10.06 B: hi my name's my name is april huck i live in los angeles california in the united states 

3.96 4.86 A: hi 

10.33 13.10 A: my name is carol wilson i live in chicago illinois 

12.98 14.19 B: oh hi 

13.78 14.58 A: hi 

14.85 19.79 B: um we're supposed to talk about personal habits and what we think is the worst 

17.99 18.94 A: right 

19.75 20.67 A: okay 

20.73 21.97 B: do you wanna go first 

21.60 27.14 A: sure well i felt smoking is because there are so many bad side effects of it 

27.33 30.22 A: you can get lung cancer just so many things 

30.37 34.20 A: whereas the different stuff they were talking about such as gossiping 

34.43 37.37 A: it's not really as bad as um smoking i think 

37.50 42.84 B: you know what i totally agree with you i the i first i thought the first one i thought maybe was gossiping 

42.39 43.41 A: right 

42.72 56.22 B: but then they went into smoking and i know personally i think because i myself participated in a lot of the different personal habits that they were talking about so from personal experience i think i've done all of them 

50.84 51.68 A: uh-huh 

52.49 53.40 A: right 

55.98 56.85 A: mhm 

56.13 60.85 B: um and i myself quit smoking cigarettes two years ago 

60.46 61.42 A: okay 

61.09 70.16 B: and um i think that it is a terrible terrible addiction because number one it's one of the most difficult things substances to quit 

69.86 70.86 A: mhm 

70.16 76.76 B: um number two it not only affects your entire physical health i mean it affects your lungs it affects 

75.64 76.61 A: right 

76.60 86.91 B: your heart it affects um in your throat it affects all the different parts of your body um i think it also affects the environment around you 

79.97 81.03 A: mhm 

86.52 87.86 A: right exactly [noise] 

86.96 89.71 B: um it affects your family 

89.30 90.27 A: mhm 

89.85 100.73 B: um it affects you know just strangers that have nothing to do with it it affects them i think it affects the amount of smog that we have the air and the air that we breathe 

98.49 99.36 A: yeah 

100.51 101.34 A: right 

100.71 108.81 B: so just in that regard i think it's just a really dangerous thing to have out there and i think because society pretty much um 

108.91 119.21 B: it's not illegal or it's you know i know there's bans out there but you're pretty much allowed to do it pretty freely still i think it's still like incredibly dangerous because of that as well 

115.37 116.15 A: yeah 

118.93 126.88 A: yeah it is and i think for me i have really bad allergies so smoking it just it really irritates me really a lot 

122.39 123.83 B: mhm 

126.68 127.50 B: yes 

127.16 130.35 A: so i think i r- i agree with you 

130.79 139.98 B: don't you think because you know i can't i cannot believe myself i started smoking when i was age eleven and i'm twenty seven now yeah i it's crazy but it 

136.90 137.91 A: really 

139.13 140.92 A: was it hard to stop 

140.45 144.08 B: it was i i tried stopping about a million times 

143.71 144.64 A: (( mhm )) 

144.19 153.85 B: and i was able to stop i started stopping when i was like sixteen and i was able to stop for a year at a time so i had w- i have i have really good willpower 

148.00 148.93 A: okay 

150.86 151.85 A: okay 

153.38 154.35 A: uh-huh 

153.91 164.84 B: so i'm able to stop at a year at a time but then i w- there was something stressful would happen in my life like a death of a family member or exams at school or something and i would just go back 

159.90 161.80 A: (( right and then you just go back )) 

164.75 178.09 B: but um the thing i didn't understand is i never understood because of my youthful age the actual like toxicity of what it was doing to my body until i started getting really terrible headaches and migraines 

173.14 174.09 A: mhm 

177.46 178.39 A: okay 

178.18 183.53 B: and it got so bad that i started having headaches and migraines every single day of my life 

183.23 184.23 A: oh 

183.68 191.26 B: and i finally went in and checked myself into this headache clinic and they told me right away like you have to stop smoking 

191.27 201.42 B: and they've isolated me in an environment for two weeks and i thought i was going to go crazy [laughter] and um basically what happened is my headaches went away 

194.76 195.57 A: mhm 

196.86 197.75 A: right 

201.18 202.17 A: okay 

201.91 207.80 B: and so i saw like a very direct correlation between stopping smoking and my headaches 

207.82 214.14 B: so i kinda did an experiment and i was able to through supportive friends and everything like stop smoking 

214.08 224.36 B: and i had a lapse where like at like six months later i finally got a cigarette hold of a cigarette and i smoked and i had like the worst migraine i've ever had in my life 

217.83 218.63 A: uh-huh 

223.68 224.67 A: right 

224.69 235.80 B: and so ever since then i have like that was two two and a half years ago i i stopped smoking after that because like the migraine was the worst i've ever had in my life i couldn't see i couldn't walk 

234.97 235.80 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

235.61 243.71 B: and i just thought oh my god this is really what i'm doing to myself and it just it lost its allure entirely 

243.08 244.78 A: and i think also like 

244.79 250.79 A: main mainly people smoke usually in their you know when they're young 'cause peer pressure 

250.07 251.03 B: yes 

250.91 258.80 A: you know that's a major you know fact peer pressure they do it because their friends and other people do it so they wanna fit in 

253.09 254.49 B: (( yeah )) 

258.56 259.50 B: right 

259.45 261.08 A: so i think that's major too 

260.96 269.82 B: and don't you think like pe- a lot of times people who smoke i think a lot of the other behaviors that we they were talking about like the not exercising 

269.46 270.56 A: right yeah 

269.68 278.85 B: and the not eating right and the gossiping i think a lot of the other negative behaviors that they were talking about comparing it with go along with the smoking 

276.20 277.23 A: mhm 

278.46 281.32 A: yeah they all kinda fit together 

278.93 280.08 B: don't you think 

280.86 282.96 B: don't you think yes 

281.42 283.11 A: right yeah you know [laughter] 

283.12 289.96 B: 'cause i mean i'm i'm also like a pre licensed therapist and there's this whole like thing about oral fixation 

286.39 287.29 A: mhm 

289.57 290.41 A: yes 

289.95 304.75 B: that we talk about and like um about satisfying your urges through your mouth it goes back to like being a baby and when you're a baby like your learn through your mouth and somehow when you're younger like you didn't satisfy those urges enough when you were younger 

294.97 296.03 A: mhm 

304.68 308.66 B: so that now when you're older you just have this urge to like 

307.36 309.17 A: right just letting it out 

308.80 311.40 B: yeah you need an outlet to your mouth 

311.29 320.09 B: so you smoke you drink excessively you gossip with your you know you you use your mouth to vent and to be like very um 

314.12 315.03 A: mhm 

319.94 326.91 B: angry with and there's kind of like a connection and i think with all of those like negative behavior type of thing 

326.53 330.41 A: i think they all kinda fit together and they all play a role 

330.28 336.24 B: right and you just kinda go downhill from there [laughter] 

333.10 334.33 A: yeah [laughter] like 

334.50 338.88 A: when i first heard it i'm like gossiping and smoking [laughter] [laughter] 

337.24 338.66 B: yeah right 

338.62 345.93 B: well 'cause then i know right now i mean it's part of my life where i'm really into fitness so i thought well not exercising you know that's terrible too 

342.49 343.49 A: mhm 

345.84 355.42 B: 'cause you know not exercising i think really contributes to a lot of like depression and um low body image and low self esteem i think but 

350.52 351.51 A: yeah 

354.61 363.03 A: right because it's like right now in the media the you know the certain look that you have you know that everyone wants you know it's just it's a lot of pressure 

361.22 362.33 B: right 

362.77 363.78 B: yeah 

363.14 366.26 A: (( you know so a lot of people turn to different things )) 

366.02 366.95 B: right 

366.60 368.21 A: so it's just yeah 

367.78 371.06 B: well smoking that's that's totally part of it too though 

370.06 371.36 A: right yeah 

371.06 378.97 B: because that's exactly everyone that's the big thing that's one of the big things especially as a woman why i didn't want to quit smoking was because everyone told me 

378.75 391.20 B: as soon as you quit smoking you're gonna gain ten pounds because it's that you have that same oral fixation and that's what you do you just instead of smoking you're still nervous you wanna feed your face with something 

381.50 382.69 A: mhm 

388.55 389.43 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

391.05 402.34 B: and you start eating and so my doctors told me well okay yeah that's gonna happen but what you're supposed to do is either chew gum or something or you exercise instead with that nervousness 

402.23 413.82 B: and you know that's how you kinda offset putting on the weight or whatever but there's so many women who smoke instead of eating lunch or eating breakfast they go out and have their cup of coffee and they smoke 

414.14 415.03 B: so 

414.86 421.79 A: so did you get like i've seen on t._v. like they have you know nicotine patches you know did you try that stuff 

419.93 421.14 B: mhm 

421.57 426.39 B: um actually i am ju- i am one of those people no i didn't use anything 

426.32 427.61 A: (( oh okay [mn] )) 

426.46 438.84 B: i'm one of those people where i just i wake up one day and i'm sick of doing something and i just stop doing it i mean i then yeah i'm a recovering alcoholic i'm a recovering drug addict 

433.18 435.20 A: right you wanna change okay 

436.85 437.77 A: mhm 

438.40 439.28 A: right 

438.62 448.14 B: i'm a recovering caffeine major major caffeine addict um that was probably one of the hardest things to give up i used to drink pots and pots of coffee a day 

442.62 443.51 A: mhm 

448.03 461.29 B: um i've i've been able to kick all of it all of that just by like one day waking up and saying oh my god what am i doing to myself and um you know there's been times where i i've said on like you know new year's eve 

451.16 452.49 A: yeah that's good 

461.05 462.17 A: mhm 

461.21 468.69 B: i'm gonna give it up i i always say like i'm gonna quit smoking on new year's eve this last time i quit smoking i said on new year's eve i'm gonna quit smoking 

464.10 465.57 A: right yeah 

468.57 478.93 B: and i woke up like on november thirteenth and i said wait a second why the heck am i waiting for new year's eve like what the heck is that all about and i just quit that day 

476.95 477.88 A: mhm 

478.90 490.09 B: 'cause i was like why am i waiting for this contrived made up crap day when i'm supposed to give up everything like i'm giving it up today like i feel like crap you know what i mean and i just gave it up 

490.24 498.43 B: but you know at the time i was dating someone and a- the same boyfriend i have now and he wasn't giving it up so it was really really difficult 

497.68 501.32 A: yeah yeah but it's hard if you don't have support you know [laughter] 

499.16 504.42 B: [laughter] it was really hard because we'd be in the car and he would like light up a cigarette 

504.34 508.81 B: and i would just look at him like are you trying to kill me or what like what are you doing 

506.72 508.38 A: mhm right 

508.70 512.35 B: so finally on january first he quit as well 

512.17 516.66 B: and so it made it so much easier after that because there was no 

516.47 529.18 B: you know it wasn't be held right in front of my face like i'd been taunted with it [laughter] [laughter] right [laughter] right but ev- and it's funny i mean even now like i walk past i go for a walk every morning 

518.61 519.54 A: right 

520.06 523.82 A: and you have support from someone else which is good

533.36 534.61 A: yeah 

534.98 536.21 A: [laughter] 

535.86 540.54 B: and they look at me like oh you're so rude and i'm like gosh this is gonna give me a headache 

539.86 545.05 A: yeah i mean it it gives me it seriously gives me a headache and i mean it's just ugh

551.73 561.89 B: i don't know i just i don't know how what kind of happy medium we can come to about that but it's really i have so many chemical sensitivities that i just wish it would be banned completely
