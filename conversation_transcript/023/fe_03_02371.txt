24.89 35.93 B: (( um i think smoking does a lot of damage um as far as cancer is concerned and different things so i think it would be out of those two as far as the worst um i've seen a lot in my family as far as smoking and drinking so those affected me the most [laughter] mhm oh yeah mm because the smoking has taken it's toll on her lungs and on )) 

35.87 36.85 A: mhm 

36.04 41.51 B: (( her circulation and on her feet and everything else and but unfortunately no matter how much we tried to get her away from )) 

41.89 44.36 A: yeah i think it's because 

44.89 51.36 A: i really don't smoke but i have seen the tolls that it takes on my mother 

46.99 47.66 B: (( the )) 

51.53 52.59 B: (( smoking )) 

51.73 53.45 A: (( ah so )) 

53.77 59.04 A: i mean she's in her seventies and can't even wa- walk 

59.28 60.26 A: (( ah )) 

59.69 60.25 B: (( she )) 

61.85 63.21 A: (( she )) 

66.02 67.23 A: (( can't )) 

66.06 67.08 B: (( just never gave up ))

81.56 82.64 A: (( in her )) 

85.29 86.76 A: (( seventies but )) 

86.89 92.47 B: right i think it's v- it's hard because it's you know addictive and so um 

92.14 93.40 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

92.80 106.51 B: i think that's the whole thing that but i i think it's a good moving in a good direction for people with these new like nicotrol and different things like that to help people kick the habit because i think a lot of people want to stop 

102.21 103.21 A: right 

106.38 111.05 B: but it's hard because it's you know a habit that they've had for so long 

110.45 111.51 A: yeah 

111.51 112.35 B: so 

112.29 114.84 A: well where we live um 

115.50 120.10 A: drinking is is a big thing i think that's why 

118.65 119.57 B: yeah 

120.40 124.69 A: i mean i deal in the school systems and um 

125.29 129.11 A: there are y- a lot of young people i'm talking 

129.44 130.65 A: twelve 

130.83 132.19 A: thirteen 

132.09 132.98 B: wow 

133.33 142.33 A: um that are drinking and their drinking i think in a lot of cases because their family 

143.11 149.62 A: lets it go on and they just think it's a social thing rather than an addictive thing 

149.58 150.72 B: right 

150.54 151.51 A: (( you know )) 

152.17 163.11 B: yeah um in my family i have like two uncles that are like totally different people when you see 'em sober and then you see 'em you know drinking so it's like 

160.63 161.79 A: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

163.15 175.23 B: you know a horrid shock for me for me to see my uncle that i love and care for this certain way and then when he's drunk it's like a totally different mad man so i definitely think you know drinking is a big 

175.67 186.28 B: you know bad habit to have and personally i don't drink or smoke so and those are one of the reasons i mean a couple of the reasons why i don't because i've seen my family 

186.19 192.68 B: basically you know in those situations and you know it hasn't been positive 

191.82 203.63 A: yeah that's that's the same thing with me i mean my grandmother had a speakeasy and ah and on holidays 'cause it's an italian background we we had wine 

203.88 207.84 A: ah not that we got drunk or anything but we had wine 

208.01 210.32 A: ah but nowadays 

210.31 223.11 A: you know where i live in which is a different area ah i mean they have kegs of beer outside their house and they think it's like common and ah the kids 

218.83 219.72 B: (( wow )) 

224.37 227.45 A: like i said very young the the 

227.84 233.18 A: parents unfortunately don't realize that they're alcoholics because 

232.38 233.58 B: mhm 

233.47 236.69 A: a lot of times alcoholics deny 

236.91 238.61 A: what they really are 

237.81 239.66 B: oh yeah definitely 

239.36 240.62 A: and then 

240.96 243.88 A: what happens is the poor children 

244.04 246.93 A: live in that environment and they 

247.99 261.77 A: unwillingly or unknowingly just fall right into the habit of being the same way the parents are do you find that with your uncle did he have a background of people drinking in front of him 

262.03 263.67 B: (( um no i )) 

263.71 265.26 B: i think my um 

265.34 269.25 B: granddad did but it's like his kids 

269.37 271.77 B: they don't drink because 

271.72 276.59 B: you know they see what you know it's done to him so i think um 

276.54 281.19 B: it's two you know two sided i mean some people look at it as 

280.64 281.65 A: mhm 

280.97 289.23 B: you know um this is something i'm not going to do because i've seen the effects of it and there are other people who you know well i'm going to try it 

285.64 286.45 A: right 

289.05 297.01 B: my dad did it and they continue the cycle so i think in families if you recognize that there is a cycle that's occurring 

295.74 296.59 A: right 

296.82 306.73 B: you try to break it you know you educate yourself on it you're able to stop the cycle but if you know some people who weren't educated on it then they continue the cycle so 

299.16 300.13 A: mhm 

306.63 308.52 A: yeah see my brother is 

308.65 313.55 A: well you should say three of my brothers and sisters don't smoke one does 

312.72 313.56 B: mhm 

313.72 321.59 A: um that person just decided on their own they were going to be like my mom and they didn't care 

321.59 322.80 B: right 

322.21 326.29 A: ah me i saw the smoking i saw the 

326.72 329.42 A: ah alcohol i saw 

329.78 333.31 A: so many different things i mean even in my times i saw 

333.60 335.84 A: people taking l._s._d. 

335.89 336.82 B: mhm 

336.11 340.23 A: (( and ah you know i just felt )) 

340.45 344.78 A: that i didn't want anything to control me and i wasn't going to look stupid like 

345.26 350.49 A: you know and do stupid things that i was going to regret the next day 

350.59 351.66 B: right 

351.31 354.54 A: so i i was fortunate enough 

354.73 357.32 A: ah never to touch the stuff 

357.43 361.70 A: and in my household we just don't do it 

357.53 358.48 B: right 

361.83 366.09 A: now i have a daughter who is twenty seven and because 

366.31 369.54 A: i never knew she smoked because in my house 

369.73 373.49 A: she just would never pull out a cigarette and just recently 

373.80 375.93 A: ah she got very ill 

376.09 378.74 A: and debilitated for a while 

379.28 384.52 A: ah because it did something to her blood flow and it did something to her lungs 

382.60 383.61 B: mhm 

384.54 385.40 B: right 

385.47 390.53 A: um so why is it just drinking i think drinking because 

391.75 397.23 A: with the job that i have i'm very involved with the drinking and seeing that 

397.27 409.73 B: i have a question for you what um in i live in dallas and one thing that we just did in the city of dallas the mayor restricted like a lot of um bars and stuff from having smoking throughout the whole place 

403.62 404.42 A: mhm 

408.94 412.42 A: oh we have that we have that too we have that 

411.51 420.73 B: what do you think about that 'cause we're getting a lot of controversy we just did it and so there's a lot of people against it and a lot of people for it and so it's like a big issue down here 

420.59 423.97 A: i think it's i think it's good because 

423.09 423.91 B: yeah 

424.57 436.05 A: what i never realized growing up even though my mother smoked and i was in the environment of smoke secondary smoke is one of the worst things that you can get 

435.70 436.83 B: right 

436.92 437.84 A: (( um )) 

438.38 439.37 A: you know 

439.75 444.82 A: i if you want to smoke in the privacy of your home that's okay 

443.50 445.53 B: that's fine right 

445.39 457.72 A: but not where there's other people involved and where you can get other people ill now i was with a person my first husband for fifteen years and he was a four pack smoker a day 

457.61 458.61 B: wow 

458.52 460.69 A: and i never knew 

460.93 468.12 A: about the secondary smoke and then i developed really bad cases of bronchitis and 

468.38 470.85 A: a lot of respiratory 

471.01 473.68 A: and i often wonder if 

474.09 476.64 A: i went through this because 

477.09 481.57 A: he was in the house and he was smoking and smoking and smoking 

481.53 483.25 B: right wow 

482.47 485.18 A: so i think people should have 

485.96 490.58 A: the option of doing it in their home but not the option 

490.84 496.29 A: of just doing it because they want to do it and having other people fall ill 

496.88 497.78 A: (( you know )) 

497.76 509.80 B: right one thing that they were trying to push like the business owners they're saying that they're losing a lot of money or whatever because the smokers don't want to come into their bars or they going to like surrounding areas because 

509.72 513.19 B: you know they can't smoke or whatever and they were trying to say that they could 

513.55 519.36 B: do like a new ventilation system or something but i still don't think that that would help you know 

517.51 518.40 A: no 

518.98 519.67 A: (( uh-huh )) 

519.45 528.17 B: not smell smoke if you're like in the same restaurant you're still going to smell it to a certain extent and it will affect those who are not smoking 

527.85 530.38 A: if they want to smoke like my mom 

530.49 533.91 A: if we go to a restaurant where we are in 

534.43 536.75 A: the northern part of the country 

536.40 537.52 B: mhm 

536.88 540.43 A: um she has to go outside and smoke 

540.57 541.81 B: yeah 

541.18 546.69 A: you know sh- she's not allowed but she'll she'll say that i got to take a smoke break 

546.65 547.70 B: mhm 

547.48 551.68 A: and then she'll go out and puff her little cigarettes and then come back in 

552.15 552.78 B: (( yeah )) 

552.46 559.02 A: and even though my mom can not walk a block and a half without stopping 

559.39 563.46 A: that's what it has done to her lungs and that's 

563.62 565.79 A: what really bothers me 

565.85 569.34 A: and maybe like you said from seeing it 

569.54 570.95 A: i would not 

571.34 578.39 A: i mean god was very good to me because when i tried to smoke my gums blew up they hurt me and everything 

578.46 582.16 A: and i said to myself it wasn't meant to be i'm not going to smoke 

578.55 579.60 B: mhm 

582.28 584.85 A: when i was very very very young 

585.17 586.16 B: wow 

585.54 594.22 A: um and never did from that time you know never took drugs never even though i was you know in the hippy times and 

593.65 594.93 B: mhm 

594.27 597.01 A: (( those people yeah there was a )) 

597.18 599.80 A: lot of drugs but i just
