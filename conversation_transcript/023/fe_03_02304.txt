55.65 56.71 A: the big rain 

56.27 63.85 B: so that so that it rains a lot i know that after it rains for about a week like on and off constant rain that everything starts to bloom

82.66 83.96 B: yeah 

83.45 89.40 A: and i'm always tempted to take two of them but they if you take two then it'll make you real drowsy and you'll pass out 

88.65 93.08 B: yeah well they say that if that doesn't work then you should try to get a prescription 

89.70 90.55 A: (( don't like )) 

92.71 94.82 A: (( that )) 

94.39 97.60 B: but i never liked claritin i tried it i never liked it

98.05 98.95 A: i'm not 

99.25 101.60 A: i'm not the type to take pills too often 

101.77 106.72 A: the only pills i like to take are vitamins and i don't like to take pills or 

101.83 102.74 B: so 

106.48 107.39 B: right 

107.62 109.43 A: things like that 

108.66 113.13 B: well when i feel like when i feel like i'm coming down with a cold i usually take zinc 

114.05 115.29 A: zinc 

114.68 115.46 B: (( mhm )) 

115.61 118.14 A: (( so what does what what's zinc supposed to do )) 

118.71 120.32 B: zinc's supposed to 

120.89 123.41 B: it's supposed to do something to your immune system 

123.60 124.79 A: right 

124.16 128.70 B: but i find whenever i'm getting sick if i take a zinc supplement 

128.88 133.60 B: it um it cuts down if i do catch a cold it cuts down the length of it 

128.99 129.75 A: right 

134.20 135.42 A: right 

134.99 138.16 B: or i'll take a um like the stress tab vitamin 

138.83 141.72 B: that have the b. complex and the c. and the zinc 

139.18 140.19 A: oh okay 

141.77 143.56 A: (( mhm )) 

143.21 145.12 B: and usually that helps too so 

145.36 146.39 A: oh 

147.22 160.28 A: yeah i guess i'm i'm pretty if i just i just let it take its course actually i actually got really sick um there's this like cold virus going around about a week ago and i got sick for the first time in my life and um 

155.51 156.47 B: (( oh yeah )) 

157.63 159.16 B: oh i got that too 

160.89 167.94 A: i didn't really take anything i actually had to go to the doctor and get some antibiotics and that's the first time i've really had to do something like that 

164.63 165.64 B: mhm 

168.52 170.28 A: so hopefully that doesn't happen 

168.62 169.84 B: i i 

170.59 172.03 B: how long did it last 

173.04 174.07 A: (( again mm )) 

174.74 175.77 A: i mean 

176.05 178.99 A: about two or three days i have to take the pills for 

177.42 178.34 B: really 

179.15 180.50 A: for ten days though 

180.93 182.48 B: i had a um 

182.85 186.79 B: i had a virus a cold a couple of weeks ago it lasted about two weeks 

187.44 189.13 B: it went into bronchitis 

189.41 190.81 B: (( it was nasty )) 

190.99 191.59 A: (( wow )) 

191.97 193.68 B: (( it was a nasty cold )) 

193.95 195.20 A: (( you see i don't )) 

195.35 199.74 A: i don't i don't want to get used to is taking pills because 

198.50 199.40 B: yeah 

200.66 203.69 A: you know you your system builds up an immunity to them 

203.12 204.52 B: oh definitely 

204.10 209.92 A: and and the virus also like in terms of uh like it's a population wide scale 

209.83 210.64 B: mhm 

210.37 218.15 A: and i've read things about uh germs and viruses getting immunity to the different antibiotics because 

218.21 221.75 A: they use them so much like there's this little tuberculosis strain out right now 

221.67 222.64 B: (( oh is there )) 

221.95 230.10 A: it's supposed to be it's supposed to be like a new strain that that mutated because you know tuberculosis is so heavily 

231.04 236.20 A: like there's so many sorts and things against it that just it mutated 

236.87 238.14 A: (( and just pick out )) 

236.88 241.43 B: well isn't also because of people they don't take the antibiotics like they're supposed to 

242.83 245.71 A: no the problem is that they're taking anti- antibiotics too much 

245.65 247.65 B: yeah for every little thing 

246.70 247.37 A: (( like )) 

247.84 250.88 A: yeah exactly like people get a sniffle and they 

248.84 250.51 B: every time you have a little cold 

250.94 252.52 A: and they get a prescription 

252.92 257.89 A: and eventually like the body doesn't respond well to the prescription any more 

258.21 259.49 B: yeah 

258.91 262.83 A: and that they just antibiotics and all different types of things like that 

262.29 265.63 B: yeah this is this sars thing is pretty scary too 

265.75 270.90 A: yeah ah i thought i might of had sars 'cause i was no i was getting sick 

269.03 270.09 B: really 

271.01 272.21 B: did you go to the did you 

271.26 275.13 A: right around the the whole sars thing no but um sars is pretty serious 

274.94 277.26 B: did you go to the doctor about it 

276.52 280.12 A: yeah this is this is the sickness that i was talking about just like with your cold 

278.46 280.08 B: and he ruled it out right 

280.23 284.19 A: yeah just like with your cold but i asked the doctor if it was sars and she laughed at me 

284.49 285.92 B: yeah 

285.22 287.46 A: (( she said if it was sars you'd be coughing up blood )) 

287.68 288.64 B: oh really 

288.65 289.59 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

289.12 290.69 B: (( i didn't know that )) 

290.11 291.73 A: yeah sars is pretty serious 

291.69 295.82 B: i thought that well they said that you have that you can't you have a hard time breathing 

296.48 297.30 A: yeah 

296.50 298.45 B: but i don't know that you coughed up blood 

298.44 302.92 A: yeah severe acute respiratory syndrome you know 

301.66 308.57 B: well if they yeah if well yeah so what else do we have to talk about now about the something they gave you three 

304.21 305.11 A: yeah 

307.51 308.43 A: (( i don't know )) 

308.93 311.11 A: yeah they gave us three topics but 

311.50 313.16 B: i couldn't hear the third one 

311.71 318.47 A: all i can remember is the illness and what do you do when you're coming down with a cold and 

318.57 321.04 A: (( that's about it i mean that's all i can remember )) 

322.67 323.85 A: (( but i mean )) 

324.32 327.01 A: i guess we can talk this topic to death 

326.65 332.29 B: (( [laughter] yeah that's right [laughter] i guess so )) 

329.99 330.73 A: but 

331.87 336.08 A: actually for i i feel good about not really having to um 

336.71 338.29 A: worry about illness 

338.31 341.02 A: but at the same time it kinda scares me because 

338.35 339.32 B: yeah 

341.73 346.95 A: i you know i'm i just kinda i just feel like everyone always deals with serious sickness 

346.81 347.70 B: mhm 

347.50 349.18 A: at some point in their life 

348.83 350.09 B: yeah 

349.48 354.07 A: so i'm thinking like maybe i'm just getting bad habits now because i don't go to the doctor at all 

354.17 355.38 B: oh okay 

354.52 358.96 A: i don't worry about that so when i get older and it should be like a regular routine 

358.60 359.99 B: right right 

359.30 369.08 A: like you should go for checkups every six months and you know like prostate cancer and colon cancer and all that type of stuff i've just i'll be in the habit of not going and it's gonna end up catching up to me 

363.68 364.84 B: mhm 

369.05 372.81 B: yeah well maybe that's nature's way of getting you ready for that right 

373.03 374.70 B: things start breaking down 

375.56 377.42 A: yeah 

377.78 381.92 A: so i i gotta get in the habit of going to the doctor even though i don't think i need to 

381.84 384.15 B: well you should anyway just for a check up right if 

384.42 386.61 A: yeah but what good is a check up 

387.11 390.23 B: (( there's nothing wrong with you [laughter] )) 

387.31 388.05 A: (( you know )) 

389.52 391.65 A: but but you know something was wrong with you 

391.72 399.87 A: like if if something was wrong with me then i'd go but i know people who go get check ups just because you know it's six months i'm going to get a check up 

393.92 394.84 B: right 

399.00 402.30 B: see i think when you do then sometimes they find things that are wrong with you 

403.59 404.61 A: (( i don't )) 

404.19 405.88 B: like they look for things 

404.66 405.30 A: (( know )) 

406.13 408.66 A: i'm pretty skeptical of the whole medical 

408.84 412.69 A: field myself like yeah you know what i'm thinking right now 

409.42 410.29 B: (( are you )) 

411.00 411.88 B: (( yeah )) 

412.28 413.48 B: what 

412.90 417.10 A: i'm thinking to study is probably about how people can't stay on topic 

417.60 419.52 B: you're probably right 

419.25 423.78 A: no it just it just occurred to me because they give people these topics and they give them ten minutes 

420.56 422.00 B: you think so 

423.66 424.51 B: uh-huh 

423.98 427.58 A: bu- but once you talk about everything you really know about a topic 

428.05 430.23 A: you're not gonna repeat yourself you're just gonna 

430.39 431.85 A: talk about something else 

431.14 433.29 B: talk about something else right 

432.79 434.37 A: yeah 

433.64 435.46 B: it's a very interesting study 

435.56 439.82 A: yeah 'cause you know these studies that they usually don't tell the people what they're really studying 

439.71 441.03 B: no 'course not 

440.92 444.42 A: they'll tell you yeah we're studying this but they're really studying something else and 

443.68 445.86 B: it could be something totally different huh 

445.67 446.74 A: exactly 

446.94 448.98 B: right 'cause we talk about who you 

449.02 452.02 B: when you're uncomfortable you talk about something different 

451.77 454.59 A: they could be counting the words that people use 

454.74 456.66 A: see how many times we repeat 

455.96 458.40 B: [laughter] 

456.74 460.27 A: a word yeah it could be something crazy like that you never know 

460.42 462.60 B: (( counting the words could )) 

462.73 463.38 B: (( be )) 

462.76 463.53 A: mhm 

463.59 464.75 B: (( it could be )) 

463.82 467.57 A: (( how many times did we say there how many times did we say )) 

467.62 470.65 A: did i think just i don't know crazy stuff 

467.66 468.67 B: cold 

470.60 472.26 B: (( how many times we say cold )) 

473.12 475.64 B: how long are we supposed to stay on for ten minutes do 

475.26 477.56 A: (( ten minutes i don't know if this was a ten minutes )) 

477.77 478.95 A: or 

479.42 480.79 A: (( was it i'm sure )) 

480.87 486.68 A: i'm sure that i'm sure they're gonna tell us in fact i'm in front of my computer so as we talk i'll just go back to the website 

487.14 488.86 A: and see what the instructions say 

489.81 491.20 B: we have to just i 

491.35 493.79 B: i would i would think that they would break in 

494.16 498.41 A: yeah they probably will yeah you know what they probably will because 

498.82 501.07 B: because they're recording everything right now 

501.18 503.03 A: that's true that's true 

503.76 506.48 A: but speaking of illness [laughter] 

507.06 507.86 A: (( um )) 

509.66 512.26 A: yeah that's about all i do 

512.39 515.00 A: i don't really pay attention to any of that crappy stuff 

515.38 516.38 A: i just 

515.44 516.29 B: (( no )) 

517.28 519.00 B: wash your hands a lot 

520.95 526.51 A: yeah i don't yeah i try i try to do that i try to do that at work uh 

527.50 529.23 A: i don't know i'm the kinda person 

529.28 531.27 A: i had chicken pox when i was young 

531.92 534.41 A: and that's about it so 

533.56 535.46 B: i had chicken pox two years ago 

536.16 537.07 A: really 

536.73 538.70 B: yeah awful 

538.95 541.30 A: wow so so you never had it when you were younger mm 

540.98 547.74 B: my kids well my kids were vaccinated and my my son's friends 

547.75 549.29 B: came down with it 

549.34 559.64 B: and i didn't know about it and um i had found out about two days later when he was already broke out so i'm thinking oh i've never been vaccinated what am i going to do so 

559.81 565.82 B: i called the doctor and they said well you actually have to wait like a week or two to see if you come down with it and that they can give you a serum 

565.86 569.90 B: like almost like an anti serum to just like help counteract it 

569.83 570.93 A: right 

570.35 573.22 B: and ended up by i came down with it 

573.09 574.01 A: (( mm )) 

573.34 580.47 B: so when i went to the doctor they said well why didn't you tell us ahead of time i said well i did tell you they said well we could have given you something two weeks ago 

580.65 583.18 B: reception didn't give me the right information 

583.28 585.62 B: so now i had to suffer with the chicken pox 

583.50 584.31 A: right 

587.27 588.29 A: wow
