0.46 1.56 B: hi 

2.90 7.11 B: hi amanda my name is cindy i'm from um central missouri 

4.80 5.59 A: (( hi ci- )) 

7.12 9.32 A: oh okay i'm in philadelphia 

9.23 10.54 B: oh okay uh-huh 

10.64 11.20 B: (( [sigh] )) 

11.31 13.07 B: and this is my first time 

12.94 15.09 A: yeah mine too [laughter] i 

14.26 19.34 B: okay [laughter] my daughter got me into this i think we're supposed to talk about illness 

16.02 16.73 A: (( just )) 

19.06 20.82 A: (( yeah like )) 

19.97 23.83 B: what was what was the question that she asked i didn't quite understand her 

20.96 21.55 A: (( [noise] )) 

23.88 35.85 A: there were several things but basically like when the seasons change a lot of times people get sick with the weather issues and then [lipsmack] um did she say something about like 

35.76 44.98 A: people say that a cold lasts seven days if you don't go to the doctor and a week if you do [laughter] [noise] i was like okay [laughter] um 

40.99 41.84 B: yeah 

44.83 52.00 A: [noise] but yeah basically like what do you do to keep well as you know if you don't get sick or what do you do to get better if you do 

52.11 55.15 B: oh well [sigh] i 

53.05 54.01 A: yeah 

55.38 58.87 B: seldom go to the doctor especially over something like that so 

58.32 59.54 A: yeah right 

58.94 62.38 B: i i wash my hands a lot and um i 

61.34 62.07 A: [noise] 

63.17 71.47 B: try to avoid um people that are sick you know if they're sick and coughing and stuff i try and avoid their airspace not share their airspace 

71.40 72.64 A: yeah 

72.35 80.43 B: and um i am a nurse so i do know for a fact that you're gonna have a cold for five to seven days regardless of whether you go to the doctor 

76.04 76.77 A: [noise] 

79.64 82.47 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah i was 

81.51 88.19 B: and uh yeah i if i do have symptoms i'll take something for the symptoms but that's about all i do yeah 

87.48 94.52 A: basically the same as me like i tend [noise] to get sick for a lot longer than that 'cause i have asthma 

94.62 102.76 A: and that always tends to make it worse with the hacking and the coughing and you get sick because you're coughing so hard and it's 

102.94 110.14 A: so i try not to get you know catch anything too i my mom's a nurse as well so you know she's like wash your hands and 

109.40 111.90 B: uh-huh wash your hands a lot [laughter] 

111.41 119.48 A: yeah so that's basically [noise] the thing i generally actually just in the wintertime when most people are sick my spring starts allergies 

119.69 120.56 B: (( yo )) 

119.71 122.94 A: (( allergies so bad yeah [laughter] so )) 

120.86 122.77 B: mine too mine too 

123.21 124.16 B: yeah 

123.50 129.97 A: but i i have noticed that i don't generally get the spring colds that people get so i feel blessed in that manner 

130.43 132.21 A: but yeah 

132.38 133.18 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

132.85 133.69 A: so 

133.84 137.72 A: i mean i i guess i get paranoid about certain things 

137.71 141.58 A: like my mom [laughter] she's got me on this thing now like 

141.40 150.91 A: you wash your hands you turn on the faucet but like you use a paper towel to turn it off you take a paper towel to the door and you open the door with your paper towel 

146.71 147.62 B: right 

150.68 151.49 B: right 

150.70 162.21 A: you throw it away as you're leaving the bathroom and you know i found that actually when i started doing that i caught a lot less colds [laughter] so something works 'cause you know people don't wash their hands and 

158.21 159.11 B: uh-huh you 

161.47 164.18 B: yeah really and they're nasty yeah yeah 

163.32 168.47 A: yeah and you're like okay that's really gross [laughter] so 

164.57 165.43 B: yeah 

168.60 174.68 B: yeah we cover our mouth with our hands and then we turn around and use that same hand to open the door or whatever 

172.40 173.33 A: (( the same )) 

173.99 175.63 A: yeah 

174.93 180.49 B: you'd be surprised at the contact that you get just from you know touching everyday objects 

179.88 181.32 A: yeah 

181.37 195.41 A: i i really started noticing that my friends were all like well why are you so concerned about it and i'm like 'cause you know [noise] i'm trying to stay healthy y'all know i can't afford to get sick [laughter] i used to stay sick for like two months at a time 

195.21 196.13 B: (( oh no )) 

195.78 202.40 A: i was just really not at all healthy and you know now i'm eating better eating regularly 

202.48 215.28 A: you know except during finals which is now [laughter] [laughter] but but you know like that kinda stuff and now i don't like the last cold i had i think i was sick for like three to five days something like that 

204.15 204.90 B: yeah 

215.43 216.15 B: yeah 

215.53 228.49 A: but i took [noise] cold ease too i don't know if you know about that stuff but like it's like the zinc [noise] um zinc lozenges [noise] [noise] yeah so at the first sign i'm like oh time to go get some more [laughter] 

220.84 221.94 B: it's like what 

222.97 224.14 B: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

228.84 230.98 A: so that actually really helps a lot 

231.66 235.29 B: uh theraflu col- or is it 

231.81 232.55 A: so 

235.38 241.55 B: alka-seltzer plus cold tablets those aren't those really knock the symptoms out [mn] 

235.41 236.68 A: (( yeah )) 

241.05 248.91 A: (( oh do they see my thing is i think i've tried the alka-seltzer thing and it was just so horribly tasting )) 

248.90 252.47 B: oh yeah gotta sorta hold your nose and drink it fast 

251.95 262.37 A: yeah is that what okay see i never did that one 'cause with that [noise] fluid you can't really drink it fast 'cause it's gotta be hot [noise] generally i would make like four cups of tea and then add a cup of 

263.02 264.35 B: [laughter] 

263.13 271.13 A: [laughter] if it was best to wait 'til the tea was super strong and i mean you taste and all but it's not as bad [noise] 

271.13 272.24 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] mm mm )) 

271.88 274.74 A: but it made me feel good 'cause it was warm 

274.89 278.15 A: i never tried 'cause you know when you don't have time to sit and drink 

278.33 282.28 A: tea or whatever you theraflu is kind of out of the question 

282.28 283.10 B: yeah 

282.37 286.59 A: so i never tried the little alka-seltzer thing since the first time i had 'em so 

287.67 288.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

289.43 293.79 A: [noise] ten minutes on colds huh [noise] [laughter] [laughter] 

292.51 305.82 B: yeah yeah i'm i'm not i don't know how i got it let my daughter talk me into this i'm not i'm not a real talkative person but she said a lot of times there would be like four people talking and then you know your four minutes go by real fast 

302.85 304.39 A: [laughter] oh really 

305.64 307.06 A: oh 

305.92 308.31 B: or your ten minutes rather go by fast but 

307.84 315.00 A: yeah see i didn't know that you know a friend of mine got me onto it um she sent out we have a list or 

315.30 318.96 A: on campus for you know various groups of people and um 

319.09 328.78 A: you know she sent out like yeah you make ten bucks a call and you know we're all broke college students so we're like ten bucks to talk on the phone okay [laughter] [laughter] sounds good to me [laughter] 

325.23 327.80 B: [laughter] 

329.16 330.14 A: (( so )) 

330.37 331.21 B: (( yeah really [laughter] )) 

330.56 341.26 A: that's why i'm like okay 'cause i definitely could use the money especially when you're not working as much during finals and you know three weeks later comes a check and you're like oh yeah forgot about that 

339.96 341.96 B: (( well [mn] yeah )) 

341.36 342.20 A: [laughter] 

342.38 343.27 A: so 

343.48 356.28 A: which helps too 'cause then you by the time you've worn your immune system down and you get back to being sick again [laughter] you need the money for cough syrup [laughter] so yeah it's 

349.15 350.31 B: [laughter] right you've 

350.69 353.22 B: dollars to go buy you some medicine [laughter] mhm 

356.65 358.87 A: that's one thing i do try 

359.03 362.15 A: not to get sick because usually when i do it's 

362.24 364.58 A: it's a real hassle [noise] 

364.90 379.66 A: and i miss classes and plus i have asthma so [noise] once i get sick or have some sort of virus usually that triggers a relapse and i end up you know [noise] tired on top of everything and i get dizzy and 

379.88 382.50 A: (( i'm like no i can't deal with all of this so )) 

382.49 395.57 B: we had a nasty th- thing come through the area a couple of weeks ago people started out with a cold you know it was like a cold common cold but it their voices went they 

391.25 392.13 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

395.43 396.42 A: (( oh )) 

395.95 398.58 B: thr- their throats hurt something terrible 

398.36 399.27 A: huh 

398.80 405.01 B: and it just it went from it's like it went from a head cold to their throat killing them to pneumonia 

404.90 406.37 A: oh my 

405.08 410.97 B: and they they missed like ten days of work almost two weeks of work they were that sick 

409.57 410.24 A: oh 

411.41 412.74 A: well that's really 

411.42 420.13 B: and the antibiotic it was had to have been viral because pe- people were going to the doctors and they were putting them on antibiotics and they weren't doing any good so it tells you right there it's viral 

418.24 419.41 A: (( yeah [noise] i )) 

420.34 427.63 A: don't understand why 'cause the last time i got sick the doctor wanted to give me an antibiotic i was like this is a virus it's not 

427.81 433.71 A: you know but i mean i guess sometimes you never can tell when it's gonna the virus is gonna cause a 

433.89 436.64 A: a bacterial infection to grow but [noise] 

437.06 443.05 A: that sounds awful 'cause i usually get really hoarse anyway 'cause i cough a lot you know when i cough 

442.88 443.62 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

443.08 448.65 A: [noise] it's really heavy with the asthma and everything so it just ruins my vocal cords but [noise] 

448.86 450.19 A: i never had it 

450.52 453.18 A: anything like that that sounds pretty awful 

452.97 456.99 B: it was just just to listen to 'em talk was just painful to listen 

456.33 458.05 A: oh goodness 

458.38 461.69 A: oh that sucks what do you think about this sars thing 

459.36 460.14 B: yeah 

462.38 463.96 B: the stars 

463.87 465.24 A: sars the 

465.27 469.56 A: (( i forget what you call it what it stands for yeah but )) 

465.53 468.02 B: oh oh the sars okay 

468.56 478.12 B: well i just hope that they get a control on it and it doesn't you know get over here and spread everywhere i think they're doing a pretty good job though at containing it 

475.14 476.52 A: (( yeah 'cause i think )) 

477.76 481.69 A: yeah they are i think there's been a couple of people in philly 

481.93 484.03 A: who've caught it and they've 

484.22 487.02 A: [noise] maybe one person died or 

487.17 492.02 A: they're still both you know in in quarantine or whatever it is they're doing with people 

491.92 492.88 B: mhm 

492.24 493.49 A: but somebody 

493.56 500.57 A: recently [noise] came over from uh china he was on a business trip or something and he 

500.79 514.23 A: brought it which [laughter] really like oh goodness here you go like just ban all travel to and from [laughter] you know that area of the co- of the world right now until we get a hold on things 

514.10 515.87 B: yeah [noise] yeah this uh 

514.92 522.47 A: the thing that gets me is like why are they i mean i understand why they shut down the hospital but at the same time i don't because people need to be treated 

522.63 525.94 A: if you're gonna shut down the hospital like i would say move 

526.20 532.11 A: everybody else into other hospitals and make one of the hospitals like a sars place or something 

531.41 532.79 B: yeah yeah 

532.18 536.94 A: need to get treated don't just put 'em out on the street or make 'em stay home and spread it [noise] 

536.55 537.43 B: right 

537.15 538.15 A: (( you know )) 

538.33 538.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

538.81 539.76 B: right 

539.14 542.50 A: quarantine [noise] some area in the hospital or something but 

542.83 544.61 A: that didn't make much sense to me 

543.79 547.29 B: do like they did years ago and have um t. b. wards 

548.10 550.12 A: (( [noise] yeah exactly )) 

550.26 556.89 A: and that way you know you have everybody together it's all under control and you know [noise] in terms of area 

557.16 561.99 A: that way you don't have to like do mass exodus of the hospital itself but every 

562.01 567.38 A: location can have their own ward floor wing whatever it takes 

567.46 568.88 B: mhm 

568.57 569.48 A: (( you know )) 

569.25 570.29 B: yeah
