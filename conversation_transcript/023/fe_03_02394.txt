34.82 36.84 A: right um i 

36.99 39.50 A: guess like we have to talk about 

39.53 42.78 A: which um habit we think is the worst one 

43.01 47.65 B: oh which one okay there was gossiping there was not exercising 

45.66 46.68 A: right 

47.23 52.12 A: right i i think smoking is the worse one i i mean i don't personally smoke but um 

52.08 53.07 B: uh-huh 

52.77 59.90 A: i've had a lot of family members that smoked a lot and they ended up dying young and so for me 

60.46 66.01 A: i think that habit is the worst because it not only affects the person but it affects the rest of the family too 

66.39 67.35 B: hm 

67.41 71.82 B: what other options were there besides smoking gossiping and not exercising 

71.29 72.84 A: i think that was it 

73.28 78.92 B: okay yeah i think smoking's the worst i guess gossiping is bad because but then like 

78.99 91.51 B: you know everybody gossips like you gossip about your friends [laughter] like if they're really mean one day like i i don't smoke and i know a lot of guys who smoke and it just stinks up the car 

80.75 82.18 A: (( [laughter] right and like they get in such a )) 

90.77 92.21 A: (( bad mood when they don't )) 

95.31 96.64 A: smoke yeah i 

96.82 105.00 A: i mean i too think that gossiping isn't good i mean i do it i and a lot of times i feel bad about having done it 

105.06 106.12 B: mhm 

105.89 110.34 A: but um i'm sure the people that i gossip about gossip about me [laughter] so 

110.16 111.80 B: [laughter] 

110.60 112.54 A: i mean i don't know i do- i 

112.99 115.63 A: don't think it really 

116.05 122.09 A: has like that as big of an impact on other people as smoking does but 

122.29 123.89 A: that's just my opinion 

122.42 124.05 B: yeah 

124.47 125.36 A: so 

125.93 128.39 A: (( i don't know what else to really say about it )) 

128.11 131.92 B: yeah me too when did you sign up for this study 

131.78 134.69 A: [laughter] just yesterday or the day before 

134.37 137.29 B: me too how weird 

136.69 137.97 A: [laughter] 

137.93 139.79 B: [laughter] oh well 

139.88 144.06 B: i think gossiping is like um 

144.85 150.53 B: it's kind of like just communicating like venting or complaining but i don't think it's 

150.55 157.53 B: that harmful unless you're doing it to make someone feel bad to make like someone else look bad i think 

157.46 158.58 A: right 

159.78 160.47 A: i 

161.59 166.18 A: it's just sometimes like i- i'll see i'll hear someone gossiping about 

166.77 172.51 A: someone else and then to that person that they were gossiping about they're gossiping about another person 

172.55 173.68 B: mhm 

173.06 175.65 A: and that's when it i don't know it just seems kind of 

176.06 177.26 A: strange 

178.13 182.08 A: but i guess it's like we said everyone does it so 

178.52 179.62 B: yeah 

183.26 184.09 B: (( mm )) 

184.16 186.42 B: and with exercising 

186.76 199.26 B: i don't know everybody that i know they either exercise a lot and they're completely committed to it like even if they're going on a trip overseas they have to find where the gym is that they can go to every day 

199.06 202.45 B: so i think it's like it's kind of like dying your hair [laughter] right 

202.22 214.93 B: once you start you're just like oh my god you just feel so gross if you don't dye your hair when the roots come on [laughter] when the fat comes you're like oh god i have to exercise and um such a big commitment 

207.00 208.42 A: right 

212.54 214.03 A: yeah 

214.59 218.25 A: so they either are obsessed with it or don't care at all about it 

218.30 219.32 B: yeah 

219.45 228.12 B: i used to run for a sports team back in high school and it felt really good like i felt so hungry and my appetite was up 

228.18 233.18 B: and i think i looked really healthy because i had like a tan and everything but 

233.79 238.17 B: it's like once college started i mean it's just about 

238.29 244.90 B: you know shopping or you know socializing i don't really exercise 

242.29 243.84 A: right 

244.05 254.58 A: i know after i got ma- well probably like six months before i got married i i started like really exercising a lot and um i had lost like twenty pounds 

252.29 253.52 B: mhm 

254.83 255.99 A: and then 

254.98 256.21 B: wow 

256.74 259.51 A: i was able to keep up with that and everything and then 

259.52 262.04 A: i had my daughter in june 

262.51 263.91 A: and um 

264.15 268.46 A: i gained forty pounds with that pregnancy but she was almost ten pounds when she was born 

268.56 271.49 A: and now i'm like just about two pounds above 

268.82 269.90 B: wow 

271.53 274.64 A: but i'm not able to exercise like i was before 

274.76 275.98 B: mhm 

274.80 280.01 A: i just don't have the time i mean she keeps me pretty busy 'cause she's starting to walk and stuff but 

280.06 283.21 A: i'm i'm not obsessed with it any more 

283.22 285.00 B: do you have like a nanny 

284.98 287.19 A: [laughter] i don't but i 

286.67 287.72 B: oh 

287.46 291.10 A: i quit my job an- to stay home with my daughter 

291.36 296.02 B: how's that like do you find that you have less time for friends 

297.09 300.81 A: y- i don't have much time for any thing these days 

301.08 305.18 A: you know she keeps me busy round the clock and so 

301.68 302.81 B: wow 

306.21 309.76 A: (( it's such a different it's a different life definitely )) 

310.63 315.51 A: but um 'cause i worked in a hospital and everything was fast pace and 

310.87 311.95 B: (( mm )) 

315.96 319.21 A: now it's like you know everyday is the same [laughter] 

319.44 324.26 A: thing it's kind of like have you seen that movie that old movie ah groundhog day 

323.95 327.48 B: (( yes i knew you were going to say that [laughter] )) 

325.45 326.41 A: [laughter] 

326.87 331.66 A: see it's kind of like that but i mean it's great it's great staying home with her it's just very different 

332.17 334.09 A: so but i wanted to stay home 

334.15 336.78 A: until my first went to school and then 

337.52 339.57 A: go back to work after that 

339.68 343.32 B: so you're definitely not thinking about another child any time soon huh 

343.39 344.18 A: (( um )) 

344.26 346.64 A: probably when she's around three 

347.27 348.16 B: hm 

348.02 356.56 A: yeah it's a lot of work i don't know if i could i don't think i could be like go through pregnancy and all of that with her at the age that she is now 

357.05 358.58 B: definitely 

359.22 362.06 A: and i definitely don't want her smoking [laughter] 

362.36 369.32 B: oh yeah totally i mean my parents don't smoke d- does anyone in your family smoke 

363.43 364.38 A: you know 

369.21 373.24 A: my father smoked he died but not from that but um 

372.91 374.08 B: (( oh really )) 

373.52 375.44 A: he he smoked um 

375.50 379.52 A: a lot and my brother smokes a little bit 

379.92 383.07 A: but um like all of my grandparents 

383.19 388.72 A: or i shouldn't say all of them but three of my grandparents died from things that were related to cigarette smoking 

389.66 391.08 B: oh wow 

389.84 390.74 A: so 

390.88 392.33 A: (( and they were all )) 

392.38 393.54 A: young 

394.12 397.77 A: i would consider them young i mean one was only fifty five when he died 

398.22 399.27 A: um 

399.70 400.89 A: and the other one 

399.80 403.68 B: wow my dad was like sixty when he had me [laughter] 

403.38 404.41 A: oh 

405.23 406.41 A: yeah 

406.42 409.26 A: yeah my dad was forty nine when he died 

410.14 413.83 B: oh my god he's like younger than my mom is now 

415.27 416.10 A: so 

415.41 416.44 B: (( hm )) 

416.14 421.72 A: i- i'm thirty and my mom is fifty my mom was nineteen when she had me though 

418.02 419.27 B: oh really 

422.30 424.64 B: oh that's really young 

424.10 425.37 A: yeah 

425.99 428.83 A: so she doesn't smoke i'm glad about that [laughter] 

428.96 442.16 A: but um yeah so all my grandparents i mean they were fifty five and early sixties when they when they died and it was all like related to cigarette smoking so i'm very against that that's why i think that's the worst habit 

439.74 441.02 B: (( have you ever )) 

442.11 443.40 B: yeah 

443.99 454.32 B: have you ever um you know smoked a cigarette outside of school when all your friends were some people like a lot of people were smoking did you feel pressured to smoke at one point 

453.66 456.76 A: i never did but i have asthma 

455.35 456.50 B: really 

456.90 458.05 B: (( oh okay )) 

457.65 458.76 A: so 

459.15 464.84 A: that would just be terrible for me anyway i don't even like to be around second hand smoke because of that 

464.42 465.37 B: uh-huh 

465.01 468.65 A: so i never really felt tempted to do that 

469.90 478.35 A: but it is kind of oh my brother was always the kid in the car when my dad would be smoking and my brother would be complaining and rolling down the window and everything and 

478.16 486.44 A: he's the one that picked up the habit and i never would have imagined that would happen but he he was definitely doing that because of peer pressure 

480.37 482.43 B: [laughter] oh my god 

486.62 487.61 B: right 

487.76 489.65 B: is this your younger brother 

489.15 490.79 A: he's younger yeah 

491.51 493.94 A: he's um four years younger than me 

494.82 495.51 B: (( like )) 

495.92 505.26 B: nobody in my family ever started smoking but um my family has a shop like that sells miscellaneous stuff including cigarettes 

504.61 505.91 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

505.22 518.07 B: [laughter] my god and so like in high school i just thought you know so many people smoke i'll just like give 'em packs of cigarettes and my brother like lectured lectured me about how bad smoking is but 

517.84 519.12 A: mhm 

518.00 523.11 B: it's like everybody around me smokes and they waste so much money on it 

524.23 527.11 A: still people around you who are smoking a lot 

526.96 530.92 B: yeah i mean not my boyfriend and 

530.99 535.40 B: nobody related to me but like um 

535.44 540.55 B: like my best friend she smokes and her boyfriend smokes and 

540.76 553.90 B: god they smoked so much over spring break that i felt like my whole throat like just in smelling the second hand i thought it was like burn i could just feel something really weird like it was a sore throat or something but once i got 

553.84 557.09 B: one day of fresh air that feeling disappeared 

557.09 562.31 A: well they say that second hand smoke can be just as bad as smoking a cigarette yourself 

562.66 567.98 B: yeah i totally agree with that i think it's even worse because it doesn't have the sulfur 

567.48 575.17 A: right i mean you don't i mean i know people that smoke aren't intentionally trying to [laughter] make other people sick 

575.25 578.78 A: and i you know i'm sure it's sure it's a very bad addiction 

575.32 576.56 B: mhm 

579.21 582.18 A: but um it really it's like 

582.19 583.75 A: the habit that 

583.79 585.02 A: really just 

585.67 588.55 A: affects other people the most 

588.89 589.97 B: yeah 

591.44 599.00 A: that's why like now in a lot of restaurants you know they ca- people can't smoke and now in bars in new york and
