0.14 1.72 B: melissa 

1.44 3.08 A: ah this is linda 

4.27 6.45 A: h- have you done this before 

5.92 7.50 B: yeah i have have you 

7.01 9.01 A: no this is my very first time 

8.63 10.88 B: okay i've only done it one other time 

10.45 11.42 A: okay 

11.05 12.59 B: it's not that bad 

12.02 12.87 A: okay 

12.63 17.28 B: [laughter] so anyways ah we have to ah 

13.03 14.51 A: [laughter] 

17.51 21.57 B: i guess give our personal view of what we think is worse of the options that they gave 

21.14 22.19 A: right 

21.64 23.88 B: okay do you wanna go first or do want me to go 

22.76 24.04 A: no you can go first 

24.05 24.92 B: me 

24.47 25.38 A: uh-huh 

25.25 30.67 B: okay well in in all honesty i think alcohol consumption is worse 

30.42 31.17 A: (( ra )) 

31.15 32.69 B: because um 

33.33 39.92 B: you know smoking in my opinion has its detriments on other people as well as the person that's smoking 

40.15 43.21 B: um but and you know over eating 

43.22 50.97 B: in my opinion um somebody who over eats that's something that's within themselves that you know they can control 

51.10 61.30 B: you know and in my opinion somebody who is an excessive eater and just continually eats um and then gets upset 

51.62 52.70 A: mhm 

61.28 72.01 B: because when they go out in public if you know they're extremely overweight or you know like a young la- you know if a woman goes to a mcdonalds and orders like you know four big mac meals 

71.93 82.51 B: that's a little excessive and i and you know to be totally honest if i saw a woman do that or even a man do that i would be like whoa that's just like a little too much 

83.13 84.59 B: um and then 

85.07 86.40 B: what was the other one 

86.49 87.27 B: i 

86.52 89.85 A: see there was smoking alcohol over eating and gossiping 

89.54 98.05 B: yeah well gossiping i'm the type of person you know where if somebody doesn't like who i am then they don't need to be involved in my life 

98.29 101.63 B: and ah if you wish to gossip about me that's 

101.81 107.41 B: you know all good i'm not going to let it affect me or bother me and you know anybody who you know 

108.20 110.34 B: talk about me i guess in like a 

110.36 116.51 B: insincere way and insulting you know i i wouldn't want them to be a part of my life anyway 

116.48 117.58 A: yeah 

116.96 120.33 B: you know i mean there are people out there who have a real problem 

120.44 124.66 B: with how people think of them an and they base their lives on 

124.96 132.21 B: you know what people think of them i'm just not you know one of those people so gossiping to me is like nothing i mean don't get me wrong i'm nosey 

131.85 133.56 A: [laughter] 

132.75 134.91 B: you know and i like to you know 

134.96 147.45 B: hear the gossip and everything like that but then you know when somebody if a neighbor of mine comes to me and tells me you know oh by the way you know the guy across the street you know got caught doing something or whatever i don't go and spread the word 

147.85 148.72 A: yeah 

148.01 155.47 B: you know so i'm like the type of gossiper who takes in the information but i don't put it back out there you know 

154.03 155.13 A: yeah 

155.68 158.39 A: well then you're not a gossiper you're just a gossipee 

158.83 160.13 B: i guess so 

159.24 160.62 A: [laughter] 

160.22 162.83 B: i'm i'm like you know the the other end 

163.09 176.52 B: of of the gossiping team but then alcohol i have a heard time with because both myself and my spouse came from alcoholic families um my husband more so severely than myself but um 

163.99 165.19 A: mhm 

176.80 183.60 B: you know what you know what happens you know with me it ended up happening where you know i had absolutely no relationship 

183.96 189.69 B: ah with my dad who was the person who abused alcohol so whereas smoking 

189.82 199.02 B: you know the person you know that you're involved or people in your life or whatever you know can pretty much say to you listen if you're going to smoke go outside 

199.18 204.27 B: you know or don't do it around me you know and that's you know 

199.30 200.21 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

204.29 213.29 B: great when i was a kid and i started smoking you know my mom said to me listen you're not going to be smoking in in the house or anywhere near me until you're at least fifteen 

213.78 226.57 B: you know and if i ever catch you smoking then there's going to be a problem so i respected that you know she really didn't have much right telling me that i couldn't smoke 'cause both her and my dad did smoke but like you know my husband he doesn't smoke 

226.77 231.15 B: he doesn't like the fact that i smoke but when i met him i smoked 

231.62 237.63 B: you know and he didn't ha- you know he may have had a problem then but he didn't voice it and you know for about 

232.03 233.26 A: mhm 

238.02 245.34 B: when i got pregnant with our daughter he tried very hard to get me to quit to the point where i was like all right i quit you know and i hid it 

245.36 247.26 B: and then i got caught 

247.31 248.35 B: and ah 

247.72 248.98 A: mhm 

248.44 250.58 B: now he's just at a point where 

251.06 254.31 B: forget it i'm not going to you know i'm not even going to bother 

253.99 254.97 A: yeah 

254.40 257.31 B: you know with it but with alcohol 

257.41 264.63 B: you know and and you know you can smoke a cigarette and its not like you're gonna if you get into a car 

264.69 278.06 B: the the effects of smoking a cigarette aren't going to impair you per se um in in a short you know in a in a sh- right you know whereas like you know i've i've seen it hundreds of times you know with alcohol 

271.09 272.84 A: no not at that moment 

278.16 284.86 B: you know i mean i i drink not that often it's very seldom like maybe once a year you know around new year's eve christmas time 

284.51 285.53 A: mhm 

284.89 288.52 B: you know or you know my husband and i go out to dinner 

289.02 294.20 B: you know and it's a place that serves alcohol because wh where i live a lot of places don't even serve it 

294.04 295.35 A: where do you live 

295.00 296.22 B: new jersey 

295.69 296.53 A: okay 

297.01 304.90 B: um you know i'll get a drink and that drink will still be like half full by the time i get done with my meal and we're getting ready to go 

304.62 305.74 A: mhm 

305.80 308.21 B: you know so what's your take on it 

310.63 316.57 A: [sigh] well i guess um my first thought was many of those things it depends on the degree 

316.66 322.89 A: and so i imagine that they really meant um that you're doing all those things excessively 

322.90 329.75 A: and which one would be the worst if you were doing them excessively and i i guess i'd have to go along with the alcohol also it's amazing how many of us are 

327.92 328.60 B: (( mm )) 

330.24 333.76 A: from ah some sort of alcoholic background somewhere 

333.24 334.80 B: right [noise] 

334.22 337.41 A: and um you can see how that just um 

338.01 338.92 A: just 

340.39 341.36 B: hello 

340.79 341.64 A: (( hello )) 

342.05 343.11 A: call waiting 

342.97 343.79 B: oh 

343.74 346.88 A: (( ah it can just destroy destroy the entire family )) 

346.43 347.76 B: mhm 

347.03 354.62 A: and um while smoking is i think is and i and i keep trying to quit i've quit about five times [laughter] 

353.92 355.50 B: [laughter] 

354.71 359.19 A: and ah i've quit for like a year and a half and um 

357.49 358.71 B: mhm 

359.36 361.12 B: what made you go back 

360.60 367.50 A: [sigh] i don't know nothing you know a couple of times there was something big but a couple of times there was nothing it was just 

367.83 379.28 B: because i've only you know i've been smoking now for probably about fourteen thirteen or fourteen years and i really other than in situations where i had to quit and i had no other choice but to 

379.42 380.35 B: you know 

379.88 381.09 A: yeah 

380.46 388.67 B: um i only voluntarily quit one time and that was when i was pregnant with my son and i stopped smoking 

389.10 394.42 B: when i was three months pregnant with him and then i didn't resume smoking until probably 

395.12 400.44 B: after he was about two weeks old and i resumed smoking because he was very colicky 

400.74 408.93 B: you know but then it it's weird because i've been in in ah situations where i've had no other choice i i didn't you know smoking wasn't an option 

401.24 402.11 A: yeah 

408.81 409.76 A: yeah 

409.16 422.89 B: for me it just it wasn't allowed you know in the situations where i was at and you know mentally i i'm one of those types of people when i'm ready to quit smoking you know i'll just say all right that's it i'm done you know 

411.89 412.75 A: yeah 

418.86 420.22 A: yeah 

421.06 433.86 A: yeah and i think that that that's true of you can't quit for anybody else you can't quit because somebody else wants you to it's just something that's got to click and that's what's happened to me before i just this is it i've had enough i'm quitting 

428.83 430.45 B: right 

433.38 434.96 B: mhm 

434.27 438.57 A: and um and i would and and it's hard every single time 

438.79 445.36 A: um but there is there is just something that clicks within you that makes you want to quit for you know for some reason you you 

446.08 447.12 A: um 

447.95 452.63 A: you know the health ramifications or ah the smell or 

452.89 455.48 A: um the cost or something 

455.15 456.13 B: mhm 

455.98 468.34 A: but i can't seem to stay away from them altogether so and both both my children smoke and see and that that after all like i'm responsible for that um and because i really think it's a terrible terrible habit i 

468.68 473.91 A: am absolutely convinced it's ah one of the worst things you can do for your health but again 

472.42 474.17 B: right 

473.97 484.00 A: ah i don't think it destroys your life and the people in your life like ah like alcohol can do now if you just drink a couple of drinks a day i don't really have a problem with that 

477.26 478.48 B: mhm 

483.58 484.77 B: right 

484.08 485.05 A: um 

485.56 489.94 A: but i think so often that people for some reason can't hold it to that 

489.52 496.43 B: yeah no like i i don't i don't have a problem with people drinking i you know i really don't i have a problem with 

496.70 502.07 B: people drinking and then their attitude changes when they drink you know 

500.05 500.90 A: yeah 

501.10 503.64 A: well some people's who personality changes 

503.32 512.02 B: right right i mean like i will be the first to say like you know i mean you know when i was in high school i did my share of partying you know and all that 

512.07 524.10 B: you know all that stuff and you know unfortunately i i came from a big family and none of my siblings you know i guess ever got caught as as often as i did drinking 

523.74 524.74 A: mhm 

524.12 526.33 B: so my mom was 

526.36 532.99 B: one of those women who was in complete and total denial you know about what was going on with with my dad 

532.94 545.02 B: but was like wait a minute you know here you know melissa's getting you know busted drinking constantly continuously she's the one who's going to have the problem so they ended up sending me to a rehab 

545.39 558.12 B: you know for just the normal reasons that like you know any teenager just goes out and party's you know just to have a good time i just just you know i was you know the oddball in the family and just really didn't care if people knew i was drinking 

551.67 552.63 A: mhm 

558.13 564.76 B: you know but i mean now you know like i said i i rarely drink my you know my dad ended up dying 

564.50 565.47 A: yeah 

564.85 570.62 B: um you know this this february of this year from you know cirrhosis of the liver 

570.11 571.14 A: yeah 

570.78 573.55 B: you know so i know what it can do 

573.23 574.49 A: yeah 

574.22 575.58 B: you know and like 

574.76 583.44 A: well you know not only can it kill you though it can destroy so much of the quality of life while you're alive that that's the part that to me is almost even worse 

583.34 591.91 B: right you know and and it's like you know it's weird because you know my you know watching my you know my dad went through the rehab 

591.86 599.26 B: you know all that other stuff and you know you know you you do that family intervention thing where you know i- 

597.71 598.64 A: yeah
