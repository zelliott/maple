67.14 69.92 A: [mn] no not really 

69.66 71.22 B: (( yeah i was going to say it's )) 

71.65 79.36 B: pretty like sort of level you might get like a few like over here we have major seasonal changes 

78.77 82.21 A: exactly and i would say that that might get 

81.18 81.79 B: (( [cough] )) 

83.15 85.14 A: where you would get sick 

84.52 88.61 B: yeah like i i do oh somet- like 

85.32 86.73 A: um do you 

88.69 89.84 B: um 

90.58 103.34 B: when the i'm a college student i know i run myself down and then when i get like in the spring this time i got a cold like a couple of weeks ago because it was like really cold and then really warm and then really cold and 

102.90 103.97 A: uh-huh 

103.59 116.32 B: then i think it it in the summer time i usually get a summer cold i think that's more to do with like walking into really heavily air-conditioned buildings and then outside and then air conditioning and then outside like i hate that 

115.38 124.26 A: you know it's funny you mentioned that because whenever i go to which isn't that often necessarily like lawton or las vegas 

123.93 124.90 B: right 

124.41 131.85 A: it's so hot outside and it's close you know with the air conditioning inside whenever i'm in air conditioning 

129.16 130.01 B: right 

132.10 142.96 A: for a half hour i just this is how i get congested i sneeze and i get that really bad cold so i hate air conditioning 

135.74 136.86 B: right 

140.45 141.47 B: yeah 

142.53 148.18 B: right so i mean i i think that like the temperature changes may um contribute to 

148.39 150.58 B: just like your body trying to like 

150.62 154.62 B: compensate with the hot and the cold like i i hate that yeah 

153.90 155.58 A: right right 

155.73 164.94 A: um [mn] what is i mean i prefer that when it's warm out i mean i h- i'm not a cold person it if the sun's out i'm a happy person 

159.64 161.12 B: right i do too 

162.03 163.16 B: [laughter]

178.92 186.15 B: you know when it's winter time it's all gray and cold and not a lot of sunlight like up in boston i think they have a lot of 

185.20 186.31 A: uh-huh 

186.28 188.70 B: seasonal depression problems 

188.22 189.74 A: right right

194.90 197.41 B: [laughter] 

198.01 199.24 B: yeah 

199.34 208.86 B: uh i'm not big on the medication [laughter] i'm more like the orange juice like hot cup of coffee hot chocolate kind a [laughter] remedies 

202.07 203.84 A: right right 

204.34 205.13 A: [mn] 

207.26 217.74 A: right exactly the orange juic- you know the vitamins and you know you just have a tendency to well i do you know just take it a little easier 

211.09 212.16 B: right 

217.24 218.53 B: yeah 

218.20 219.45 A: (( um )) 

218.88 221.38 B: like the whole feed a fever starve a cold thing 

221.16 222.78 A: right right 

222.82 226.85 A: exactly um when i have a fever 

226.92 231.15 A: i mean [laughter] i'm good for nothing i mean like let me sleep 

228.98 229.94 B: yeah 

231.03 231.97 B: right 

231.72 239.56 A: um i'm really a very bad patient [laughter] so i'm better off being alone and just just sleeping 

239.77 241.03 A: um 

241.23 243.76 A: when i have a cold i can deal with it 

243.54 244.46 B: yeah 

244.35 245.79 A: and you too 

245.54 247.67 B: [laughter] yeah yeah i'm i'm the same way 

246.79 250.13 A: well you're young too [laughter] 

247.68 255.65 B: [laughter] yeah i mean when i have a fever i still like to like i like to be in bed and just feel like duh [laughter] leave me alone don't [mn] 

254.25 259.24 A: you get hot and cold it's really uncomfortable 

255.95 257.01 B: yeah 

258.82 260.26 B: right definitely 

259.67 260.49 A: um 

260.53 264.62 A: [laughter] the minute you you know cover up then you start perspiring 

264.21 265.60 B: (( is yeah )) 

265.04 268.25 A: (( and um that's when i know i'm sick )) 

267.77 277.00 B: yeah that is definitely and then but but usually you know that's when it breaks and you know you know you're up on the upswing it's just like it's just going to get better 

270.55 272.11 A: right right 

276.73 286.34 A: exactly so why go to the doctor why i- i mean to be honest i don't even feel good enough to call the doctor at that at that point 

279.37 280.47 B: right 

284.00 285.06 B: yeah 

285.47 287.96 B: yeah well i mean at that point it's like 

288.34 291.24 B: the point un- unless it's like sort of like you get 

291.43 298.36 B: like i don't know uh if it's a really bad chest cold and you have like bronchitis or something that's the only time i would 

295.58 297.20 A: exactly 

297.98 306.77 A: well yeah because one time i had an accident and they gave me a pain pill and it's like why are you doing that i had like it was something with my ribs 

306.21 307.31 B: (( right yeah )) 

306.76 316.81 A: and i wasn't breathing right and they said well if you don't breathe right you can catch pneumonia and i said you're kidding so i've never forgotten that because you're not breathing properly 

316.91 326.23 A: and so that's the only way that if it really carries on then i will because i know i've got to get something to to break that up 

321.67 322.65 B: right 

325.93 327.05 B: yeah 

326.47 330.03 A: because i certainly don't want to end up with pneumonia 

329.51 332.06 B: (( [laughter] yeah oh no [laughter] )) 

330.07 339.05 A: [laughter] but it prior to that i didn't even know that if you don't breathe ri- you know and that was just from a car accident it wasn't from you know being sick 

333.64 334.58 B: yeah 

338.75 344.02 B: right yeah um do you do you know much about the the saying they said like you know if you 

344.05 352.80 B: have a cold and you stay home and it lasts for seven days if you go to the doctor it lasts a week i mean i know it's the same amount of time so i don't know much about the 

344.30 345.08 A: (( stop )) 

349.98 352.37 A: right right exactly um 

353.10 366.05 A: [mn] i'm not sure i mean i heard you know s- a- starve a s- a- h- see i was even get confused on starve a cold and feed a f- yeah [laughter] right so wait starve a fever and 

360.47 362.82 B: yeah feed a fever and starve a cold 

365.41 367.65 B: no starve a cold and feed a fever 

367.05 374.22 A: okay i even get confused on that saying so um yeah i think things just have to run their 

369.61 370.64 B: yeah 

374.55 375.63 B: their course 

375.17 380.97 A: run their course um like you said unless it's you know something in particular 

376.51 377.81 B: yeah i agree 

380.79 381.81 B: right 

381.16 383.59 A: you know but if it's a basic 

383.84 391.48 A: something that you can deal with why go to the doctor when you're going to run into people who are sicker 

391.09 392.93 B: what about um like 

392.98 394.43 B: the flu shot 

394.65 403.99 A: you know what [mn] i haven't i have prior gotten flu shots occasionally and i'm not quite sure if if they've worked 

403.63 404.49 B: right 

404.18 409.28 A: um the last couple of years i know there was a shortage on flu shots 

408.81 411.03 B: right yeah there's a shortage 

409.79 413.43 A: and so i know i didn't get a flu shot then 

413.51 416.76 A: and i don't think i've had any worse of a year 

416.66 417.90 B: right 

417.22 418.43 A: um 

418.85 426.15 A: you know [laughter] going back i mean i don't write down on my calendar when i'm not feeling so good but i don't think i've um 

422.16 424.27 B: [laughter] 

426.24 432.22 A: as a matter of fact i think i felt better you know [laughter] um 

428.48 429.32 B: yeah 

431.75 446.51 B: you see i know with me like you know when with with being a student like i know like when i run myself down like with studying and like all that great stuff that i'm going to like get sick because my immunity is going to be down and 

440.76 441.78 A: right 

445.02 449.63 A: [mn] and you're also in a lot of places with a lot of people 

449.10 450.32 B: yeah 

449.82 458.06 A: and there's a probable tendency that other people have germs and you're passing them back and forth 

455.74 456.75 B: right 

457.44 458.42 B: right 

458.19 459.34 A: (( um )) 

460.67 466.14 A: you know but that's what you get when you go out at all [laughter] 

463.68 464.63 B: yeah 

465.21 467.44 B: that is true [laughter] 

466.53 468.22 A: so um 

468.82 477.35 A: you know i just have to you know i have to knock on wood all the time when i'm when i'm feeling okay [laughter] because it's not necessarily going to you know [mn] 

474.36 475.89 B: [laughter] 

477.00 487.52 B: yeah but the the seasonal al- allergies are rough i mean i do get um occasional alle- allergies 'specially like in the springtime when everything starts to pollinate

489.17 490.45 B: yeah 

489.81 492.18 A: i'd say i don't know why but

496.62 498.13 A: right right 

497.14 502.03 B: that one nice day it's out and everyone's cutting their grass i go nuts [laughter] i'm like no

517.52 524.00 B: i i i don't i mean it yeah i'm the same way it doesn't bother me to the point where i need to take action because like i 

522.70 528.08 A: right you just have the tendency to to sneeze a lot more [laughter] 

525.85 538.03 B: right i mean [laughter] i mean it worries me because you've like taken one medication and then they have all these side effects and when you start taking another medication for um the side effects next thing you know you're like on fifteen different medications right 

531.22 533.29 A: oh yeah the side effects are 

537.13 546.64 A: right exactly you know yeah i'd rather not take the medication because i don't need to be drowsy most of them i think make you drowsy
