158.28 162.96 A: back when i lived in south carolina there's really nothing else to do but drink [laughter] 

162.30 176.41 B: you know what that is such a coincidence because i just came back from south carolina this weekend i drove down to south carolina my daughter got married in september and she lives in south carolina she moved down with her husband and they work at the western in greenville i don't know if you're familiar with that 

175.02 176.06 A: (( oh okay ))

181.31 182.61 A: oh very nice 

181.67 189.20 B: at the western yeah so and i know there really is nothing there to do except for smoke drink and eat [laughter] 

188.42 194.57 A: yeah i was in law school there and there is you know all they do is play golf and drink and i don't 

192.93 196.94 B: oh yeah and they have their their business meetings and 

196.30 206.76 A: right and i don't play golf and ah [laughter] it's the only social thing there is is you don't decide to go to a bar with your friends you just go to the bar 

204.92 205.93 B: i know 

206.73 212.14 A: and your friends will be there ah bourbon and ginger 

208.13 209.87 B: what's your drink of choice 

211.47 214.65 B: bourbon and ginger yeah i like bacardi and coke myself 

214.68 218.82 A: good drink good drinks have the ingredients and the name 

215.31 216.39 B: yeah 

218.07 219.20 B: what's that 

219.04 221.95 A: a good drink has the ingredients and the name 

221.20 228.06 B: that's right that's right it does is that what you know my husband is a recovering alcoholic so i can relate 

228.15 230.10 B: to the drinking you know 

229.28 230.49 A: (( oh yeah )) 

230.45 235.53 B: and along with the drinking comes the smoking so whenever i drink which is not you know too often 

235.57 239.10 B: i can get through a pack of cigarettes just sitting at the bar you know 

238.28 242.53 A: yeah because i was i smoked when i was younger 

242.99 255.57 A: and eventually i quit and after i quit the only time i still smoked but the only time was when i was drinking and eventually i had to just sort of put it into because once i was 

255.56 262.35 A: in south carolina drinking six nights a week you know that worked out to too much smoking too 

258.68 259.67 B: mhm 

261.54 267.26 B: mhm oh i know and and now with the cigarettes up here up north they're like five dollars a pack 

266.78 270.93 A: yeah well that's what helps me cut down my drinking when i moved to l._a. 

270.31 271.61 B: yeah 

270.99 274.96 A: if you go to a club here and it's ten fifteen dollars for a drink 

274.11 275.42 B: are you kidding 

275.29 276.79 A: yeah 

275.60 278.98 B: oh my god i thought five dollars a drink was too much here 

279.08 280.57 A: yeah it's ah 

280.62 281.73 A: that's 

281.75 286.51 A: it doesn't allow for much drinking if you're living on a tight budget 

285.72 297.29 B: mhm well m- my ah my husband just stopped smoking in ah september actually and he started saving his money and he bought himself a digital camera with the money that he saved from not smoking 

297.45 307.21 B: so i was really surprised because i didn't know that he was saving this money and ah it came time for my daughter's wedding and he said i'm going to get a digital camera and i said we can't afford that 

307.26 319.75 B: and he said do you want to bet and he pulled out a cigar box filled with tens fives tens and twenties and i said where did you get that and he said i told you i was going to stop smoking and when i did i was going to start saving my money and he had four hundred dollars in his cigar box 

319.55 320.63 A: wow 

320.01 321.96 B: (( and that was only seven months )) 

322.03 327.66 A: most people don't have the discipline to even realize how often they used to buy cigarettes 

327.12 328.63 B: oh absolutely 

327.68 329.97 A: i'd sure like to save that money 

329.27 336.29 B: i know and you know you always find the money somewhere you know when you have a habit like that now i've been smoking since i was thirteen you know 

333.60 334.44 A: yeah 

336.43 346.95 B: i can still remember the first time i i inhaled my my friend taught me how to smoke [laughter] and she said just sh- she scared me sh- 'cause i was puffing the cigarette and um 

341.46 342.26 A: (( oh )) 

347.11 348.99 B: sh- i wasn't doing it right 

348.98 354.64 B: and this is back in nineteen seventy three and she said she scared me from the back and i [mn] you know 

349.09 349.87 A: yeah 

354.53 365.38 B: and that was the first time i did it and i've been smoking ever since but damn i'm really trying to quit i'm i'm i'm going to do it i say you know and may thirtieth is my goal they they say don't just quit cold turkey you know 

365.57 366.46 A: (( ah )) 

366.10 369.94 B: just do it you know set yourself a goal and 

367.81 368.68 A: (( huh )) 

369.35 371.85 A: that's what you have to do it it's 

371.69 385.02 A: it's like when you're in bed and you're really tired and your alarm's going off and i don't know if you're an anti morning person like me but you know you're sitting there and saying oh i have to get up but it's so hard 

376.02 376.95 B: uh-huh 

380.21 381.25 B: mhm 

384.51 385.80 B: mhm 

385.57 392.62 A: but actually doing it you just do it and you know then you can do it 

392.13 394.32 B: (( mhm yeah i want to do it )) 

394.00 402.32 A: and sm- quitting is the same way it's entirely a issue of focus of your mind 

400.85 404.62 B: oh it truly is it really is you know if i 

403.59 407.22 A: and if you just absolutely decide it you can 

407.42 410.41 A: but but i know it's not easy to do that 

411.10 412.24 A: i've ah 

413.51 419.91 A: girlfr- connie my girlfriend smokes and wants to quit but doesn't want to quit quite enough to actually do it 

419.36 422.74 B: does does now does that bother you does she does she smoke in front of you mhm 

423.23 426.71 A: ah it doesn't bother me so much um 

426.77 438.25 A: i wasn't when i smoked i wasn't really addicted so it doesn't it's not a problem for me like that and i smoked long enough that the smell of it and everything else doesn't bother me so much 

437.14 438.05 B: mhm 

438.28 450.75 A: but ah what bothers me is the fact that is you know she's an unhealthy person you said you have m._s. she has something called the shed syndrome which is ah is 

444.21 445.78 B: (( yeah )) 

451.13 455.37 A: equally serious and her smoking really harms that 

454.68 456.10 B: what is it called again 

455.88 457.98 A: it's called the shed syndrome 

457.37 458.92 B: what is that all about 

458.92 464.73 A: it's fairly rare it works sort of like lupis in which it causes your ah 

462.51 463.46 B: okay 

464.96 473.12 A: it's triggered by a virus and it causes your immune system to react against the virus but then against itself 

472.73 477.60 B: oh okay yeah that is sort of like m._s. m._s. is an overactive immune system 

477.56 479.14 A: yeah 

478.14 482.82 B: yeah and they don't know how it's caused with the virus is there any kind of treatment that she's on 

482.95 489.79 A: ah they have some drug treatments that are supposed to help breakouts but nothing that cures it of course 

490.09 491.44 A: and ah 

491.48 496.74 A: some people just live their lives with it and some people die from it 

496.28 499.32 B: oh no yeah that is rare 

497.38 500.18 A: you know it's one of those yeah it's 

499.39 502.18 B: um i mean i i was a nurse and i never heard of it 

502.34 510.41 A: yeah most most of the time when we go to the hospital she breaks out and we have to take time to explain to the doctor everything 

509.98 510.92 B: mhm 

510.93 513.17 A: because they usually don't know 

512.69 520.68 B: right right but you know along with a chronic illness comes a lot of stress too and that makes it doubly hard to stop these bad habits that we have you know 

520.43 521.77 A: exactly 

521.18 523.15 B: i know how old is she 

523.42 525.30 A: ah she's twenty nine 

524.74 529.37 B: oh gosh yeah that sounds like it's a young persons disease like what i have 

529.61 532.64 A: yeah i think it first manifested in her 

532.69 537.73 A: when she was like twelve or fourteen something like that 

535.58 538.03 B: oh really wow 

538.08 542.29 B: that's something that i never heard of an- an- being being from the medical field 

542.96 544.95 B: yeah yeah 

545.33 550.88 A: yeah so but ah yeah i mean smoking's the last thing she needs to do with her 

549.85 552.10 B: (( oh i know i know ))
