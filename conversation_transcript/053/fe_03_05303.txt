92.78 94.14 B: right 

93.05 101.88 A: you know we've kind of let our guard down you know over the years you know and now that we are are faced with it it's it's something new for us to try to um 

102.03 103.93 A: uh clamp down on it 

103.87 106.14 B: [noise] i guess the hardest thing for 

106.49 110.60 B: [noise] governments you know state and federal and the local guys 

111.06 113.15 B: to do is is 

113.35 121.99 B: to distinguish between foreign threats and uh threats in our own country you know that that thing up in oklahoma city 

121.78 122.73 A: right 

122.14 124.17 B: when it happened i thought it was

155.09 164.17 B: they have a huge job and consider the effects it's gonna have on your family but getting back to the topic i guess [lipsmack] i don't know 

164.66 171.63 B: i don't i guess we're still searching for the answers on how to address this issue and uh [noise] [noise] [noise] 

169.90 182.90 A: you know wi- and with the bio terrorism that's that's that's uh you know and that's really something that's that's very really hard to a- and and my opinion i i don't really know uh but it's some- something kind of hard i guess to put a handle on 

182.68 185.46 B: i know you can't see it you can't smell it 

183.38 184.29 A: you know 

184.88 186.90 A: that's right that's right 

185.49 191.72 B: you don't even know it's there until you get sick and [lipsmack] by that time it could have spread and [mn] 

192.43 195.70 B: well i think uh [lipsmack] i don't know [lipsmack] [lipsmack] 

195.44 205.95 A: you know a- and a lot a- and i think back too when um i can't exactly say what chemicals well uh there was some ch- chemicals that the farmers were not allowed to use 

206.04 207.51 A: in this country 

207.58 212.40 A: but they g- they were allowed to use them in other countries and then we would get 

212.57 226.17 A: uh the crops from that country you know that used the chemicals that the farmers in this country couldn't couldn't couldn't use you know and and that i i don't i don't know if they have clamped down on that or not but that that could be a a a step in the right direction 

226.99 231.28 B: i don't know how old you are but were do you remember the tylenol scare we had

244.35 258.39 B: are are into this terrorist stuff have not taken the consumer uh i mean the bio terrorism you've got to [lipsmack] you've got to have some scientist on hand and know how to handle that stuff it takes a lot of technical know how 

255.94 258.81 A: ex- exact exactly yeah 

258.44 261.82 B: i'm really surprised that we haven't had in this country

397.39 399.52 A: an- and you know it is 

399.65 410.17 A: yeah now yeah 'cause that's where i tell my kids you know i say well well daddy what you think about this well i say i'm not surprised but daddy why not you know the bible foretells this you know and that's the way it is 

410.38 419.93 A: you know you can do an- anything you can to try to try to disprove it but uh over time and over years it's been proven that what what's in the bible is [laughter] 

420.00 421.18 A: is coming true 

420.99 422.78 B: yeah 

421.70 422.57 A: you know

449.23 453.07 B: and wonderful things will happen during those thousand years [noise] 

452.42 461.83 A: that's right and you know something else i want to say too i think back to the the the the the syphilis incident in in in alabama you know i- it's 

461.94 469.22 A: um how they let that ran rampant and that was our own people doing that to us you know just to see what was what 

469.15 479.62 A: and and and so you you you you kind of have to wonder sometimes if things are not just planted by our own government you know just to see what's what 

479.61 483.69 B: [noise] oh i think our government's done a lot of things that they should be ashamed of 

483.07 487.54 A: very r- [laughter] very much so [laughter] very much so 

484.23 485.79 B: um [noise] 

485.87 487.32 B: but i don't want [lipsmack] 

487.37 489.64 B: but and and 

489.84 491.07 B: i'm mormon 

491.33 499.61 B: [noise] and if you read the history of the mormon church mm the federal government really let us down 

499.45 500.38 A: yes 

499.99 506.90 B: uh the state of missouri the governor of the state of missouri in the eighteen hundreds issued an extermination order [lipsmack] 

508.07 511.88 B: and it wasn't rescinded until about eight years ago [lipsmack] 

512.20 522.84 B: out of the courtesy to the church now it had been forgotten about but the order read that if they mormons were not out of the state of missouri by a certain time that [lipsmack] 

523.26 527.94 B: uh anyone could kill them that's why they fled to utah 

525.05 526.39 A: mhm oh man 

527.59 530.68 A: i see i see i didn't oh man 

528.49 534.50 B: [lipsmack] a- and and it's just and the main reason why the missourians 

534.53 537.54 B: did not like the mormons was they were 

537.96 547.79 B: a majority voting block and they were very very anti slavery and those those uh those people in missouri wanted slavery so bad they couldn't stand it 

542.19 543.95 A: right right right 

547.17 548.76 A: [laughter] yeah yes 

547.83 554.41 B: and and they had a lot of reasons to hate mormons and the polygamy issue was one of them and that was kind of 

552.22 553.47 A: yeah 

554.53 557.80 B: what they jumped on but it was really over 

558.61 568.22 B: [lipsmack] t- so many of them congregating out there and becoming a majority of voters and [lipsmack] they got pushed on out and [noise] 

566.86 569.45 A: that's right that's right that's right 

568.27 574.80 B: they're all they lost all their land their farms and everything that they had built and um [lipsmack] 

575.28 576.40 A: yeah 

575.70 588.47 B: then then the federal agents followed them out to salt lake city and harassed them out there and [lipsmack] arrested uh church leaders for practicing polygamy and there was no law against it whatsoever 

579.41 580.91 A: [laughter] yeah 

581.10 582.16 A: [laughter] 

585.71 586.65 A: (( [noise] right )) 

588.14 589.04 A: (( yes )) 

589.32 595.51 B: but it wasn't 'til they passed the edmonds act that it become illegal in this country any way 

590.94 592.54 A: yeah 

594.40 599.89 A: you know but it uh i'm i'm thinking about the the the the bio terrorism it would be so hard be-
