150.34 151.26 B: (( uh-oh )) 

152.06 159.56 B: i just talked to two [laughter] i just talked to two guys who graduated with philosophy and i said well you you plan if you plan on teaching or you plan on going somewhere 

156.00 158.11 A: are they having trouble enough well 

158.36 171.17 A: i've been working minimum wage um well i i'd i'd like i'd like to teach but i mean i i know it's it's not all that easy but i mean i i like anyway but right now i just i was a manager of the cheese shop 

160.74 161.87 B: it's a great it's 

166.27 167.02 B: (( yeah )) 

170.75 172.04 B: (( mm )) 

171.10 173.35 A: and i was making about twelve 

173.05 176.20 B: (( mm right mm well )) 

173.27 174.30 A: an hour 

174.22 178.20 A: and um you know i i ended up getting fired from there 

177.78 179.45 B: (( too many hours yeah mm mm )) 

178.05 191.14 A: and and now i'm looking for a job but i was pretty serious about the place and now i'm looking for a job that i don't take very seriously you know 'cause i just don't want i was sort of stapled to the place and now i i'm kind of wondering 

184.46 186.57 B: hm 

188.23 189.77 B: (( hm mhm )) 

191.12 204.30 A: what's the least amount of money i can make for doing you know kind of nothing so i mean which is why i'm doing phone calls like this [laughter] well [laughter] instead of looking for yeah a little i don't give blood no but it's actually a good idea 

194.58 196.07 B: right 

198.43 199.70 B: (( right well you can )) 

199.74 201.80 B: you can give blood you you can give 

202.70 207.36 B: we used to give we used we used to give blood back in the sixties 'cause if you can remember the sixties you didn't live 'em 

207.97 213.77 B: but [laughter] but ah that yeah you can do that but there's there's jobs you can call on the telephone for instance i'm a telemarketer i don't 

208.02 208.88 A: [laughter] 

213.74 226.05 B: i don't ah i've never worked for any organisation if you work in the capitalistic society and you're a manager or a retailer or whatever you're working seventy hours a week and you're not getting rewarded for it it's that simple and if you there are there are things you can do 

214.12 215.78 A: yeah 

222.28 223.20 A: yeah 

225.15 237.33 A: well they i mean i i can i can just imagine i mean when i was making i was making four of an hour and when when i would get my pay check it was about ah you know i was just always making about nine an hour before the taxes 

229.72 231.31 B: right 

235.86 238.24 B: (( mhm well what do you think )) 

237.18 241.91 A: so i can't imagine making five fifteen an hour you'd be getting like three fifty an hour 

241.29 254.61 B: yeah that's sad really ah well but i question was and we have to stay on the topic or they jettison us and we don't get paid [laughter] is the minimum wage is it fair well you and i both agree that ah it's ridiculous five dollars an hour what can you 

245.14 245.93 A: (( ah )) 

247.18 248.47 A: (( yeah [laughter] ah )) 

253.78 260.95 A: well it i mean it it depends on what kind of jobs that are making that kind of money i can't think of a single job that would be worth doing for that kind of money 

259.45 272.05 B: oh oh i wouldn't i wouldn't leave my door but that's that's the idea is is it f- is it to is it okay to bring it up to five fifteen well of course but what does it do what does it do to the rest of the economy our economy's driven on greed 

267.21 268.27 A: (( oh yeah )) 

271.83 272.63 A: right 

271.92 275.67 B: ah let's face it you know the stock market's a big gambling casino 

275.47 284.10 B: [laughter] in my opinion and it's driven on greed so what happens when you raise the minimum wage well all the raise them because those people who are indolent 

275.48 276.31 A: (( ah yeah )) 

283.88 291.04 B: those people who do not want to work in our society our i tend to think we should have more of a socialistic system anyway taking care of our 

291.26 295.21 B: you know um um not not that people shouldn't work and scratch and claw 

294.25 296.00 A: (( mhm right right right )) 

295.36 301.40 B: but i i think things should be made a little scratchy but i also think that you know basic medi- medical care and those things should be taken care of 

300.51 302.11 A: right right right okay 

301.72 303.60 B: (( i really think so i think it's ah )) 

303.01 304.67 A: (( i'm with you on that okay [laughter] )) 

303.96 313.77 B: yeah yeah well i'm ready to move to canada so [laughter] but but at my age you know you'd thought even the baby boomers are coming up you know and it ah i don't know what's going to happen everything's upside down 

311.43 312.17 A: yeah 

313.71 314.70 A: yeah 

313.92 315.65 B: so so what [mn] what's the minimum 

314.79 315.73 A: well i 

315.87 322.08 A: i mean i really don't know i i don't have ah much indication like ec- economics or um 

321.01 322.91 B: (( mm mhm )) 

322.06 326.45 A: anything like that i mean i don't really know what the impact is of the minimum wage 

325.23 327.55 B: well i don't either i we can we can 

326.40 329.42 A: where the jump is like in the big picture ah 

329.00 330.36 B: we can guess at it 

329.24 337.05 A: i mean i imagine i mean i i i for one you know who has probably al- has always routed for it because i figure you know 

331.88 332.44 B: (( [mn] )) 

336.39 337.59 B: (( mhm )) 

336.81 349.32 A: you're doing grunt work which is usually it's usually the grunt workers who are making minimum wage i figure if you have to do this shit work you may as well be getting something you know that usually medical or get some sort of 

338.71 339.59 B: mhm 

341.31 342.29 B: mhm 

343.26 345.27 B: (( mhm mm )) 

348.54 353.31 B: well it's like mcdonalds' wage isn't it isn't it like that wouldn't peop- it's not the we hate to poi- mhm 

350.87 360.87 A: yeah probably i mean but you don't have to i i was i was thinking i i mean i know mcdonalds you know not too long ago and and you know the people are just they're robots there you know 

359.73 361.42 B: yes mhm 

360.92 367.44 A: it's not like in the commercials where they're all friendly you know they don't even make eye contact they're they're they're zombies working there 

363.15 364.07 B: [laughter] 

365.16 366.32 B: that's right 

366.58 369.47 B: that's right and that's that's the same 

367.58 375.17 A: ah i mean they ah i mean i mean but i i imagine if if i were making three fifty after taxes i'd probably be like that too 

375.20 378.40 A: (( you know [laughter] i i'd be miserable standing at my little register )) 

377.13 391.45 B: mm mhm so i guess the question was does it help ah is it good are you for it i guess in a way i am and on the other hand we have a screwed up system that rewards um ah ah professional sports players and ah m- musicians who who who who scream at you 

378.46 379.34 A: you know 

391.22 392.04 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

391.45 394.93 B: for you know millions of dollars and insult us you know 

393.67 394.51 A: yeah 

394.95 396.48 B: insult women anyway 

396.58 406.82 B: it [laughter] i mean i might like some of that stuff but you know it's i'm a musician myself i'm a musician myself i listen to everything but but to but but but it's a screwed up system it's top topsy turvy so 

400.17 401.04 A: right 

402.71 403.53 A: yeah 

406.68 412.30 B: what happens when you raise the minimum wage well what good does it do really it's about this people are still on the bottom 

412.26 416.80 A: oh yeah i mean i don't think i don't think ah you know raising it from ah you know 

416.94 421.09 A: five you know four ninety to five fifteen's going to you know 

418.04 419.54 B: (( mm )) 

420.21 421.62 B: mhm 

421.23 431.29 A: yeah change the rotation of the earth or anything i i i can't i can't even see it as having that bit much of an impact you know positive or negative for either side of the case you know 

423.39 425.61 B: yeah it's just yeah it's not going to really 

427.42 428.28 B: mhm 

430.39 434.10 B: it's just a political f- football that doesn't do any good whatsoever 

433.16 438.34 A: yeah and and it sounds kind of good like oh we're raising the minimum wage you know and and then 

436.38 443.68 B: yeah mhm it's like bush when he gives a tax cut tells everybody look what you're going to get in your pocket well it's not that much money really the tax cut 

439.25 440.38 A: right 

442.27 446.61 A: yeah okay i got a check for two hundred dollars in the mail one day okay great 

444.47 447.94 B: yeah okay um yeah really did i really get two hundred dollars 

447.00 449.08 A: (( [laughter] yeah yeah mm )) 

448.10 462.73 B: ah come on it's it's all ah smoke and mirrors and that's what i think about the minimum you know rai- raising the minimum wage because when um when i got two dollars an hour when i worked for the borough of cheswick in western pennsylvania when i got out of high school i i you know i had enough to go out and have a good time [laughter] for the week 

462.24 463.27 A: right 

462.70 467.36 B: and that was minimum wage two bucks an hour then in nineteen ah nineteen sixty six 

465.14 466.22 A: yeah 

467.02 475.70 A: but also it's a lot cheaper to go out and have a good time so i mean now now you go to a bar yeah i mean i i don't know what it's like where where are you staying in pittsburg 

469.81 470.78 B: yeah 

472.07 472.93 B: (( mhm )) 

475.16 480.25 B: western pennsylvania which is ah coming up a little bit pittsburg yeah it's pretty provincial here but not like boston 

476.58 477.53 A: okay 

478.24 488.12 A: o- okay well i mean i i don't know what what you know the prices are like there but i mean i i i if i go to a bar i i have to spend you know it's like four bucks for a beer 

487.53 491.25 B: yeah in new york city you also pour pour ah if 

488.14 491.93 A: you know and then once you tip it's if you tip it's five 

491.32 498.06 B: five bucks in new york so you know and you pay tip you you you if you walk out of there with only spending forty bucks you're you're you're hap- probably happy 

493.14 494.07 A: yeah 

497.18 508.09 A: i mean let's say you you know if you're making minimum wage you're making less than a beer an hour that's not really [laughter] that's not really good money to to to go out go out and yeah 

501.90 502.99 B: (( [laughter] that's right )) 

503.32 514.21 B: [laughter] i like that i like ah that that that's how we should measure our wealth how many beers we can drink [laughter] and how many glasses we can break after we drink it 

508.50 509.91 A: [laughter] 

512.90 519.73 A: yeah i mean well i mean i'm just saying if if if that's the kind of money you're making you can't even afford to go out and have a couple of drinks and get a meal or something 

514.77 515.62 B: yeah 

517.95 527.64 B: no i agree with you i agree with you no in the old days what they would do is um measure how much you could pay what you paid for a suit in nineteen twenty versus nineteen thirty versus nineteen forty 

524.46 526.00 A: (( mm )) 

527.52 537.54 B: and the m- money might [mn] made you made in nineteen seventy for instance when i was married you can multiply times three and a half now and it's equivalent in other words i made like ten thousand a year i thought i was happy 

537.41 538.33 A: (( mhm )) 

537.75 540.05 B: it's like thirt- thirty five thousand now 

540.24 551.69 B: ah when i first got my first job so there's a multiplier you know and ah i what what economists look at is what how much ah well one of the things that's interesting is is a man's suit what they paid [laughter] because men's 

550.57 553.18 A: yeah you mean that's what they look at are are you 

551.66 562.61 B: [mn] well not always no but that's one of the indicators in an economic class i took what you paid for a suit in nineteen twenty and what you pay what you can of course you can pay two thousand dollars on an armani or something 

556.72 557.80 A: really 

561.69 562.92 A: (( yeah )) 

562.46 568.97 B: but i i mean i i you know generally speaking a suit of clothes ran t- there's vari- ah markers you look at in the society 

565.01 566.01 A: (( oh )) 

567.54 572.14 A: like six seven hundred dollars or something like that all right um on average for a decent 

569.35 576.55 B: yeah you know what do you pay for rent in boston ah ah the the probably cheapest rent you could find up there is you're lucky to get seven eight hundred dollars a month 

576.10 579.14 A: well um oh f- for a one bedroom 

578.53 580.41 B: yeah for a thousand 

579.46 588.37 A: for a one bedroom good good luck for less than a thousand i mean you can get studios for about eight hundred but remember that's going to be in boston it's going to be in the sort of 

583.00 583.82 B: yeah 

585.77 587.45 B: (( mm )) 

588.17 589.09 B: my son 

588.26 598.21 A: outskirts i mean i i can't aff- i could never afford to live i mean i mean as a student at least if i if i you know hit it big in the future it's different but i mean 

590.44 591.35 B: mhm 

593.85 594.60 B: yeah 

596.01 596.91 B: mhm 

596.98 599.89 B: new york city new york city my son just came back with his his girl
