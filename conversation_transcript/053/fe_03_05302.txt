23.08 24.66 B: yeah i guess 

24.47 25.23 A: (( [cough] )) 

25.27 27.76 B: (( ah bioterrorism )) 

27.90 30.73 B: well you know i don't know how to ex- it to ah 

30.92 34.13 B: make a statement on it 'cause i'm no expert on that 

33.42 43.24 A: no not me either but it seems like to me after everything that's went on that the smart thing were to do would be to start here in this country and clean 'em out before we go somewhere else i don't know w- 

43.30 47.19 A: i don't know what that's really a rough call to make i'd say don't you 

47.68 52.63 B: i say it's very difficult [mn] bio- to prevent bioterrorism 

53.05 54.84 B: (( [mn] ah )) 

55.34 56.53 B: (( you know it )) 

55.40 60.09 A: well that that's sort of something i don't know ah it um as far as um b- 

60.27 63.96 A: i don't know ah i don't really know that much about it and stuff like that but i mean 

63.73 75.65 A: [noise] it's seem like they gotta get a lotta stuff together to to build it the way you know only thing i'm speaking [noise] from is what i hear on t._v. [noise] and stuff 'cause i don't really know nothing about it but [noise] i don't see how you could what do you think about it 

72.86 74.11 B: well 

75.91 80.26 B: what i think is it's a very difficult business because i don't know how you'd begin to detect 

80.37 86.27 B: when there's an outbreak and if there's something in the offing you d- i mean what [sigh] 

81.27 82.13 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

83.61 84.26 A: (( [noise] )) 

86.57 90.41 A: and by the time you figure out what it is it's probably done killed a million people 

90.00 95.26 B: it well you know there's th- th- there's the anthrax type which doesn't spread 

90.78 92.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

95.51 102.36 B: and i mean i think it that that's being handled that it's like i- it just hasn't reoccurred so 

98.46 100.15 A: (( [noise] )) 

102.00 115.31 A: i'll tell you what i think it's as bad as what the the bioterrorism and stuff is the fear it puts in people 'cause you don't know y- y- everybody when that stuff come out about the letters and stuff nobody i mean i'm i'm sure i was the same way i didn't everything i touched i was afraid to open anything 

106.88 108.09 B: (( yeah well i )) 

114.92 116.20 B: that's me too 

115.88 118.83 A: you just can't help but getting people with stuff like that though 

118.88 126.52 A: and that's as long as they're doing that they're winning i reckon on that front but and that's really a bad subject but i m- 

119.18 120.06 B: me too 

123.04 132.76 B: yeah what can you do to prevent to prevent bioterrorism i don't have a clue i don't i i think that they're asking the wrong people for that kind of a question yeah yeah 

132.14 146.09 A: yeah that's a pretty rough one right there but i don't see how i don't see ah with all the money and stuff that's being spent on it i don't see that there's no way that they could have something to detect i mean there's so many forms of it i mean it could be just something dropped in the water or 

146.16 156.39 A: i mean but when we was that they were fighting a lifetime t- what ten years ago it could've been they could've b- you know sprayed it on the b- sand or whatever and then br- we bring it back here and you don't really know what you've got 'til it 

156.56 157.66 B: (( that's right )) 

156.63 158.33 A: 'til it does you in 

158.81 159.72 B: yeah 

159.61 161.03 A: but i don't really know 

159.96 161.70 B: so i would say [mn] 

161.96 164.43 B: in a couple of words not much 

164.61 166.30 A: (( yeah [laughter] the )) 

164.81 166.43 B: not much that we could do 

166.41 168.73 A: no there's not really much you can do and it's 

168.84 177.90 A: just have to learn from people falling over dead i reckon 'cause it's gonna take a lotta people dying before they figure out what it is and by the time you figure out like i say by the time you figure out what it is it's been got 

171.69 172.66 B: yeah 

178.15 179.08 B: yeah 

178.50 179.95 A: really got a hold of you 

179.90 182.11 B: (( yeah not not a and i don't )) 

181.40 182.34 A: (( [noise] i don't [noise] )) 

183.54 196.17 A: ah but they care i don't that that's really something that you i don't know how you would ever stop something like it's just like when they you know they strap dynamite [noise] and stuff to themselves and blow each other up but ah how would you ever stop that i mean how can you stop people from doing crazy stuff like that 

195.18 196.38 B: (( that's right )) 

196.24 208.63 A: [noise] so i don't know y- i'm as far as i'm concerned as far i know i mean i ain't smart about none of it but this mercury and stuff just in regular thermometers if you break that open and put it in water something like that wouldn't that kill that'd kill [laughter] everything wouldn't it i mean [noise] okay not 

208.46 209.75 B: well well it 

208.55 212.86 A: that's not biohazard or nothing i mean but it could be that simple get- 

210.36 211.52 B: yeah 

211.97 224.38 B: well it's not it's not a biohazard it's a chemical hazard but [mn] you know that mercury in thermometers that can poison the water and you know it's just it can leach into the water it can leach into i- 

215.02 216.39 A: yeah 

224.67 227.37 B: into the air ah 

226.41 230.69 A: what about the stuff that we got stored i mean don't we got a bunch of that stuff stored somewhere 

230.90 237.02 B: well nobody's talking you know i i mean unfortunately this government will point fingers 

237.08 242.74 B: at ah at other governments and say there's problems over there but we don't talk about what we got 

237.49 239.13 A: (( yeah )) 

242.70 256.51 A: and it's sorta i mean i know we're not i know per se using ours on our own people or nothing like that but as far as that goes as that topic goes what do you feel about this right here i mean ten years ago when we was over there the reason we went over there is 'cause of these weapons and all that stuff 

256.44 266.24 A: while we was over there and you don't know what all they you know in the subways they put stuff over here and stuff you know you don't know what's going on as far as that goes but i don't know why [noise] they didn't do something about it ten years ago i 

266.32 271.29 A: mean i give it as far as that man goes and his bioweapons or whatever i don't really know 

271.36 276.38 A: [noise] what to think about it there ain't much you can do about it [noise] um [noise] you just more or less helpless i guess 

276.26 278.37 B: that's right 

278.46 279.64 B: that's right it's 

278.74 279.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

279.67 280.23 B: (( [mn] )) 

281.07 282.06 B: (( ah )) 

283.03 284.92 B: i think all you can do is 

285.18 296.40 B: [mn] is institute checks as they've done at airports and ah ah ultimately it my guess is it must be pretty difficult to pull off in any kind of a mass 

285.70 286.92 A: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

296.40 300.38 B: m- function and mass manner because 

297.34 298.05 A: [noise] 

300.40 303.69 B: otherwise they probably would've done it already 

303.12 304.64 A: yeah and there's really ah 

304.53 313.96 A: i mean like i say and fear's got a lot to do with it too 'cause once once you get that the like you know them them envelopes and stuff like that i don't know if that was considered bio t- terrorism or whatever 

313.01 317.29 B: yeah bio that's ah anthrax bioterrorism but something worse is 

313.81 324.48 A: yeah is that but i mean it's just like what do you do i mean you've never heard it but you're dealing with stuff you don't know nothing about you've never had no contacts with they've had no dealings with you don't know really what to do with 

321.45 322.73 B: (( well s- )) 

324.38 329.19 B: smallpox is is i mean i'd i think i th- i think that's been 

327.50 329.03 A: (( it [noise] )) 

329.79 335.23 B: ah reacted to i think we've got a lot of smallpox vaccine in this country now 

335.31 345.87 A: yeah that come that come along pretty quick they took care of that one pretty quick but ah that's of course they've had some dealings with that before they've had something to fall back on they know really what's going on but that was pretty deadly too 

335.34 336.31 B: (( but ah )) 

346.25 348.41 A: but ah [noise] i don't know 

348.69 357.70 A: [noise] there's so many things that ah they curtail so many stuff there's so much stuff that could be in there i mean it didn't really be specific this bio- s- that covers a lot of [laughter] field there 

358.04 359.08 A: (( but ah )) 

358.20 359.02 B: yeah 

359.43 360.68 B: (( yeah i'm not )) 

359.92 361.61 A: [lipsmack] i don't know what you could really do 

363.29 369.33 A: i don't think anybody really has an answer to that one i don't think i think you could ask a million people and they'd probably wouldn't get the answer to that 

368.26 376.22 B: sure it's no well i'm not sure what the porp- purpose of this ah survey is whether it's to get people's ideas or just to see how people interact 

376.25 385.43 A: yeah i'm not really sure that's sorta when i heard that one i was well i said i've never done this when i heard that one i was like well lord what i don't know that's that's totally o- over me [laughter] i don't really know 

381.94 383.24 B: (( but um yeah yeah [mn] )) 

385.48 390.99 A: i'm just more or less they said to go by whatever they tell us or 'cause i'm lost on that one i don't really know 

391.08 398.69 A: it's got to where everybody you think everybody you're meeting now cr- that you don't know you pass on the street's got something you know they could pull out [laughter] something or 

398.68 410.06 A: stick you were something or throw something on you you just it's just really bad [noise] everything's just horrible [noise] you can't really do anything w- without being worried to death anymore about everything so i don't know what else 

406.99 407.56 B: (( yeah )) 

412.33 415.54 A: i don't know i don't really know what they're asking us on this one 

416.38 422.15 A: but i'd i'd say they're doing about us much as you can do i'd i'd say everybody probably say that i don't really know what else to do 

420.65 428.98 B: yeah i think you say that what what whatever it is it's being done right now it must be working because we're not hearing any outbreaks you know 

425.47 426.82 A: (( [noise] )) 

427.93 434.70 A: no everything has curtailed e- everything is went off a little bit the last couple of weeks ain't maybe really longer that [noise] 

432.78 437.60 B: well i'd kinda like to find out what was learned about this anthrax 

437.66 442.44 B: thing whether th- whether it was ever nailed down who caused it or what 

442.66 448.06 B: you know whether it was a terrorist thing or it was some kook internal to the united states it's just yeah that's 

447.66 453.71 A: [noise] [noise] i'll say and yeah that's l- the copycats is what's gonna do it too 'cause you know those people i mean [noise] it there there's people that would 

453.50 465.98 A: it that don't like anybody they they would do bioterror- if they could get their hands on anything they'd use it on us i mean and they see people doing this and they try to copycat 'em and do [noise] stuff and you're just [noise] that there's so many trails going so many different ways [noise] i don't know 

465.99 469.33 A: [noise] this is one of them things i might never figure out [noise] and i don't know but they 

469.24 481.96 A: they have seemed to put a lid on it a little bit 'cause like i'm like you i ain't heard any more [noise] really no big outbreaks in oh a pretty good while i'll say in a couple of works it's a lot longer than that [noise] [noise] but they they might've put a lid on it but then again you know you can't never tell 

481.91 485.30 A: as soon as they take care of that one something else will pop up somewhere else it's 

484.69 486.27 B: (( right yeah yeah )) 

485.65 487.40 A: it's really bad [noise] [noise] 

489.81 494.28 B: how'd you get involved in this thing how'd you get involved in this thing yeah 

489.84 490.42 A: (( [cough] )) 

491.78 500.82 A: huh [noise] ah well my girlfriend here she i don't know nothing about computers she's all into 'em and she stays on 'em just about twenty four hours a day and i'm just sorta 

500.99 510.12 A: ah she signed me up for it and asked me would i be interested in doing it and i didn't know you know i was willing to try it but i when they ho- when they told me this topic here i was just going oh lord i don't 

510.17 513.59 A: (( i don't believe i'm i don't [laughter] know what to really do this is )) 

513.62 523.31 A: (( a [noise] yeah but like ah like they're just trying to get us to see what we're gonna say about it or something i don't know 'cause ah lord i sure don't know nothing about it except i know it's just a bad deal you know it's )) 

523.39 533.83 A: but they're they seemed to have done they seemed to turned a corner on it at least like i said there's no big outbreaks here in the last little bit but that could change in a wink of a eye i reckon just like it did when it come in a wink of a 

528.83 530.29 B: (( yeah yeah that's it you know )) 

533.77 535.37 B: yeah 

534.42 537.32 A: eye but i don't know have you been doing these things long 

537.90 539.26 B: par- pardon me 

538.71 540.51 A: have you been doing these things long 

540.54 542.68 B: ah i did one other one 

540.63 541.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

542.72 546.15 B: it was also a a a strange topic and 

546.16 548.72 B: neither of us knew quite what to say about it so 

548.35 549.84 A: [laughter] i was on this 

549.93 563.92 A: i sort of stand i appreciate everything that they are doing i mean i'm glad they're trying to do something but ah a- and i couldn't honestly tell you if you for a million dollars what the what they have done i don't really know they've not really come out and said they don't wanna come out and say i mean what's going on but 

563.99 570.09 A: it you know i don't know really know how bad it is it may be worse and they won't l- let us know [noise] i don't h- i don't know 

570.16 571.56 A: (( ah what )) 

571.58 572.79 A: (( [noise] you're what [noise] )) 

574.10 579.69 A: oh i don't know [noise] what do you think about if they're do you think they'll ever find any weapons and stuff like that over there in iraq [noise] 

580.63 584.85 B: yeah mm you know i think the whole thing's a hoax i don't think they're gonna find anything 

584.25 598.75 A: [noise] well i think it y- yeah i'm i believe i agree with you there i don't think well that's sort of cooled off on that now nobody's mentioned it i mean they're sorta getting away from that every day and people that bring that up are sorta looked at a little funny because but i thought that's the reason we was over there but now it's 

597.70 599.95 B: i'm still waiting to hear about osama bin laden
