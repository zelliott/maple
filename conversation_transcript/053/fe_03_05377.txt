83.33 86.26 A: is it okay yeah 'cause i think california it's more [sigh] 

86.42 88.95 A: but then the cost of living here is so extreme you know

99.19 106.53 A: yeah i mean it's a tough i mean they and and you know if you were i guess if you were single and you were real disciplined you know you know with your finances and

109.31 113.32 A: [sigh] you know luxury or [mn] that may not even be the right word you know 

112.88 114.82 B: yeah yeah [laughter] 

114.14 118.86 A: like me i mean i mean i've stopped drinking you know and it's funny how i 

119.04 124.98 A: [mn] financially how it is you know [mn] like now i got i got money in my pocket you know what i'm saying that's why i stopped drinking 

123.19 124.21 B: yeah 

124.68 125.69 B: yeah 

125.23 127.91 A: [cough] about fifteen years ago i uh [sigh] 

128.20 130.85 A: i just didn't like the what was what was happening with it 

131.20 133.79 A: and [sigh] uh stopped doing it and uh 

134.02 138.74 A: now you got a coupla bucks in your pocket that ordinarily you wouldn't have [sigh] you know but uh 

137.03 138.30 B: yeah 

139.71 146.29 A: [mn] yeah i mean [mn] my only reason my only actual knowledge is like i say thirty years ago when i first got married you know that was 

146.33 149.71 A: here in l._a. it was like three twenty five an hour that was the minimum [sigh] 

149.41 163.99 B: yeah that's what i was getting at uh one dixie i [mn] a grocery store when i was bagging groceries [sigh] but uh i don't know i think that that must be poverty level that i mean if you're making that you must be on the what they consider poverty 

161.92 162.83 A: well 

164.04 170.40 A: well it felt like it you know when you first get married you know it's that's really not on your mind so yo- [mn] you know it's it's all state of mind you know you 

170.26 182.81 A: first get married you're in love you don't worry about stuff like that and th- and then when you fall you know when when the reality sets in you say [sigh] you know damn we can't do anything you know you're lucky if you pay your rent and you know cover the necessities 

173.19 174.28 B: oh yeah 

179.11 180.05 B: yeah 

180.64 181.68 B: yeah 

182.91 184.15 B: yeah 

183.48 185.91 A: [sigh] and then you say jesus you know it hits you 

186.43 191.29 B: [lipsmack] i don't know i think it it should i think they should make it at least six fifty you know 

191.17 192.63 A: (( [sigh] well yeah )) 

192.39 195.71 B: but then um i don't know if businesses can afford to pay that you know 

195.87 204.17 A: yeah i mean it's it's a tough call you know it's uh you know you know people need it but i mean if if you drive a business out of business with its employee cost you know 

204.32 209.20 A: then the guy's not making anything you know or he's going on unemployment or 

205.84 207.10 B: yeah 

209.52 216.87 A: [sigh] you know which i'm not i mean i've been very fortunate in my life i've never had to do that you know but i i can't imagine that that's an easy uh [mn] 

216.96 225.22 A: you know an easy way to go i ca- i gu- i don't imagine you get very much [mn] in terms of what you would ordinarily get from your you know your last place of employment 

224.56 228.23 B: right you get half i guess 

225.58 227.08 A: (( you know i mean )) 

227.75 231.38 A: well i think here in california it's even less than that you know 

230.30 231.17 B: wow 

231.73 235.82 A: and uh you know aside from the fact that you don't feel good that you ain't working [sigh] 

235.85 236.70 A: you know 

236.78 247.85 A: i mean 'cause most guys that i know when they get in trouble it's because they ain't working [mn] you know i mean 'cause the truth is it if you're working hard forty hours a week or fifty whatever it is [sigh] you're too damned tired to get in trouble 

245.27 246.43 B: right 

247.70 249.06 B: oh yeah 

248.59 250.67 A: (( [mn] i mean that's the way i've always found it )) 

250.44 251.57 B: yeah 

250.88 257.70 A: you know i mean if you're tired you know and your buddies say hey let's go do this and you're like well you know shit i wanna get some sleep you know 

257.99 260.27 A: 'cause i'm tired i had to work today you didn't [cough] 

260.40 264.16 B: yeah yeah idle time yeah that's true that's very true 

263.58 266.05 A: you know if you were to put if you put hours in anyway 

266.36 267.40 B: right 

266.81 269.05 A: but uh [sigh] 

269.16 278.75 A: you know i never i've alw- in a in a sense i was lucky though i you know my wife was a she was a waitress [sigh] you know she wasn't making very much in terms of salary but she was making tips 

278.68 279.68 B: right 

279.09 281.38 A: you know and that was like cash every day so 

281.14 294.52 A: [sigh] in that sense that was very helpful [sigh] but i think she at that time i think she was even making less than minimum wage [sigh] because they told her like you know you get two dollars an hour plus you keep all your tips or something [mn] which i guess is okay you know if you [noise] if you're you know 

281.32 282.60 B: (( right mm )) 

294.91 298.90 A: if you're working in a place that's busy and you know people are leaving you 

299.41 301.35 A: you know [sigh] a fair amount of money as a tip 

301.46 304.17 A: [sigh] and it's cash every day you're not waiting for it 

304.56 305.14 A: (( [cough] )) 

306.36 309.83 A: but it'll drive a lot of guys to here in l._a. to drive a taxi [sigh] 

310.00 311.38 B: oh yeah 

310.80 312.30 A: you know 'cause the ta- 

311.41 312.20 B: yeah 

312.34 316.12 A: taxi can be a dangerous job in a city like this but 

315.51 324.11 B: yeah everybody uh it it's usually in new york everybody who does that is arab [sigh] and then d- and then down here everybody that drives a cab is haitian 

316.81 317.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

324.20 329.15 B: it's like every yeah the a minority have a corner on the market there with taxicabs 

324.36 325.78 A: is that right 

328.52 333.57 A: well you know mo- most guys with any brains really don't wanna do it [sigh] especially driving at night 

331.98 333.08 B: yeah 

333.64 334.71 B: oh yeah 

333.90 336.84 A: you know i mean i've driven a limo [sigh] and uh 

336.92 339.69 A: you know even that can be strange in l._a. you know 

339.23 340.35 B: yeah 

339.77 349.65 A: i mean it's not it's not you don't get a sense of danger but it's strange you know what i mean [mn] you gotta guy and you're taking him from a club to a club and you know you gotta lotta alcohol involved and 

343.63 344.63 B: right 

348.94 350.22 B: right 

349.45 358.62 A: [sigh] you know people get kinda [sigh] i don't know kinda swirly sometimes [noise] but a guy driving a cab let's say in a bad neighbourhood you know 

353.65 355.33 B: yeah 

357.69 360.04 B: it's just so easy to get out and not pay 

360.30 365.58 A: well you that and you know and if the guy's gotta you know a a drug problem or something he sees you as you know 

365.31 366.49 B: money 

365.89 369.16 A: y- yeah exactly he 'cause he sees you you know you're cash 

368.79 370.36 B: (( yeah )) 

369.45 371.01 A: you know so uh [sigh] 

371.26 382.73 A: i mean the budd- when i you know growing up here when i had buddies that [sigh] you know lost their job or whatever [sigh] i mean you know you go and you drive a cab you know but also i had several [sigh] 

382.52 391.84 A: you know at that time you know you get robbed and [sigh] guys you get guys putting guns to the back of your head and you know [noise] that ain't you know i don't know about you but that ain't real friendly 

385.03 386.06 B: oh yeah 

388.02 389.21 B: yeah 

391.52 394.00 B: (( no no [laughter] )) 

392.14 397.38 A: [laughter] i don't think it's friendly in florida any more than it is in california [mn] 

396.53 397.33 B: (( no )) 

397.79 400.84 A: but uh you know you do that because it's a cash business 

401.33 408.89 A: but because it's a cash business you gotta be careful [sigh] you know and if i think if a dude's making a decent wage he's not thinking about stuff like that 

404.11 405.80 B: right 

408.93 418.34 A: you know in other words if you're making a la- a wage where [sigh] you know you can sorta do what you gotta do and maybe have a few bucks left over [sigh] you're not thinking about how to do other stuff 

418.96 420.41 A: (( [sigh] but )) 

419.17 421.00 B: right right 

421.42 426.84 A: you know but i'm sure there's a a business perspective to it and how they look at it and you know 

425.55 436.43 B: [mn] they had a thing going here for a while they paid teenagers and um i think uh retired people a a different minimum wage than if you were uh you know in in your prime working years 

436.36 440.45 A: oh is that right so i never heard that that's actually sounds pretty interesting 

437.12 438.61 B: (( yeah )) 

438.88 439.84 B: yeah 

440.32 451.98 B: right and then they also had a thing that uh if you had a business and you did business with the county down here [sigh] you had to pay your employees at least seven or eight dollars an hour they called it a living wage 

452.21 456.36 A: okay but did they but but then they probably made the contracts a little bit more attractive [mn] 

456.68 461.44 B: i i guess they did i don't i wasn't too i don't remember it too well but uh 

460.72 468.50 A: [noise] yeah 'cau- well out here with the what they would do is if if a guy was union [sigh] and he hired uh and he hired guys like from a 

468.52 475.73 A: like [mn] i think the way out here they did it they yeah if you lived in a certain zip code that zip code was considered like a poverty area 

475.77 476.58 B: right 

475.98 481.86 A: so if you hired somebody whose address was from that zip code you had to pay 'em like three dollars extra or something 

481.98 482.82 B: (( oh )) 

482.01 486.59 A: and the and the government would kick in uh [mn] you know like more than the contract 

486.44 488.63 B: right [lipsmack] right 

488.07 493.48 A: which is interesting you know [sigh] i mean god i mean just 'cause the guy lives in a certain zip code he may not be poor you know what i'm saying 

493.45 494.34 B: uh-huh 

493.56 496.29 A: i mean you know not everybody in a bad neighborhood is poor 

496.02 497.39 B: right right 

496.53 500.89 A: you know what i mean i mean i mean sometimes it looks that way but it isn't you know 

498.90 500.25 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

500.50 501.68 B: yeah 

501.30 501.95 A: (( [cough] )) 

502.27 508.57 A: then i've known a lot of guys too that were poor but we were real proud and [mn] you know they wouldn't take shit from anybody you know 

507.32 508.26 B: right 

508.77 511.24 A: and and that's cool too you know [sigh] 

510.35 511.57 B: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

511.54 516.76 A: but uh i mean you know i [mn] probably in reality it probably did help some guys that needed it 

517.00 520.28 A: you know if you were con- you know considered in the poverty thing 

519.61 521.74 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

520.84 527.01 A: but i don't know i mean it's a tough call i mean it's just it's a tough it's tough to make a living to survive making that kind of money 

526.96 527.98 B: yeah 

527.25 530.07 A: [sigh] but then you gotta look at how the business guy looks at it too 

529.87 532.15 B: (( right right [noise] )) 

531.15 532.98 A: you know but that's uh [sigh] 

533.76 540.17 A: but that's the business you know i mean that's to me i look at it like that's like you know it's the cost that you know it's the cost of doing business [mn] 

540.26 541.26 B: (( [sigh] what )) 

540.38 543.01 A: you gotta take care of you gotta take care of your people you know 

542.81 544.06 B: right 

543.96 544.74 A: (( [noise] )) 

544.13 546.99 B: are you allowed uh three calls maximum here 

547.11 550.86 A: that's what i was told but i i'm not sure to be honest with you 

548.31 549.44 B: oh okay

551.16 554.02 A: i'm on i'm on about i'm on my second one which one are you on 

553.81 555.45 B: this is number three for me 

555.64 558.84 A: oh okay yeah i i think that's how they do it but you might wanna 

558.34 559.99 B: do you know why they do this 

560.02 563.39 A: [sigh] [sigh] it has something to do with a it's a linguistics study [mn] 

563.60 565.80 B: oh yeah i think they yeah 

565.18 576.41 A: it yeah it's uh a you know [mn] your speech patterns and how you talk and and how what all that means and [noise] i had a lady from uh [mn] vancouver
