16.20 17.16 B: okay 

16.64 24.38 A: [laughter] yeah um as far as the topic goes do i think the minimum wage increase to five fifteen is enough ah definitely not 

24.23 25.47 B: yeah me neither 

24.85 34.75 A: um i don't think that anybody in their ah you know even if they're single is going to have a very easy time supporting themselves with that kind of money i mean 

34.69 41.14 A: [mn] look at how many people there are out there these days that had to work two minimum wage jobs just to make ends meet 

42.26 51.55 B: i agree with you don i'm i'm a voice animator by profession and it's a damn good living and i got only one kid and a house and my dogs and whatever 

42.30 42.96 A: ah 

47.85 50.44 A: mhm 

51.52 59.88 B: and ah it you know i'm not struggling but i look around and i go how how does anybody do this with all the stuff that crops up all all the all the um 

59.83 71.18 B: the hidden problems of just ah just living in in ah ah ah today's society how do how do they how could they possibly survive on on how do they survive on ten dollars an hour 

71.45 75.91 A: that's a that's a good question i'm i'm a college student at the moment ah 

76.02 81.65 A: spent a few years ah out in the real world ah cleaning up my mistakes and ah 

81.72 86.39 A: unfortunately a lot of that time was spent ah working minimum wage jobs 

86.24 87.45 B: yeah 

86.29 99.39 A: and i could barely scrape by with that money i couldn't do anything basically i went to work every day and came home and paid my bills and i'd be lucky to have you know twenty or thirty bucks left over every check to buy food or gas 

90.40 91.29 B: yeah 

97.17 108.23 B: yeah it depletes the spirit you know it really depletes the spirit it's not enough to make enough money to make ends meet that's not what life should be about 

107.68 108.88 A: exactly 

108.86 120.72 B: you need enough money to to nourish the spirit as well so you can do other things which nourish the spirit just doing it and you know i i don't get into the issues of well gee you shouldn't have that many kids if you can't af- 

120.88 132.45 B: you know yeah those are left wing issues and i'm i'm i'm a am a democrat and i believe in a lot of that stuff but i think people should limit their kids ah you know considering the fact that they probably can't afford to take care of them 

132.21 144.33 B: but beyond that if indeed you are in a situation that you're making five some dollars an hour or six and seven dollars an hour i don't see how you survive even as a single person much less having kids i just don't see it 

132.53 133.86 A: (( mhm )) 

142.85 151.88 A: exactly i mean i was single i had no kids and you know i live i live in a pretty economically depressed area up here in new york 

151.84 159.48 A: and ah you know rent's really low everything's fairly cheap but it's still nearly impossible to live on that amount of money what mm 

156.11 156.92 B: yeah 

158.43 160.98 B: and in new york new york is oz 

161.70 173.63 B: it's the land of oz that's that's that's ah i i i i know 'cause i have some family that lives in new york and and were looking at a a college for my daughter at n._y._u. and that's that's expensive as hell to live in new york 

173.28 178.78 A: well i live way up state i'm like ten minutes from the canadian border 

177.92 179.32 B: oh my god 

178.98 185.29 A: so there's like nothing up here there there's hardly any industry at all um 

181.31 182.52 B: yeah okay 

184.30 185.56 B: yeah 

185.09 199.53 A: there's a few ah s- ah aluminium plants nearby that that most of the people in this area who who grew up here their their fathers worked at 'em and their grandfathers worked at 'em and you know that's the only thing in the area that keeps it going 

196.30 197.23 B: right 

199.35 200.39 B: i see 

199.45 200.23 A: um 

200.14 210.59 A: people are fleeing this area like crazy because there's just no jobs and nothing over minimum wage up here and it doesn't help when you've got employers who 

203.21 204.46 B: (( i bet they are yeah )) 

208.25 209.53 B: that's really crazy 

210.51 221.58 A: do their best to keep everybody part time so they don't have to pay benefits so they don't have to you know up the wages or or anything like that it's it's just too difficult to live on that amount of 

221.80 227.91 B: and we're also facing a really bad situation with of course with ah ah with overseas business 

227.90 232.66 B: i mean in my business ah a lot of animation has gone to canada ah which has been 

232.52 243.42 B: really deleterious to the hollywood community and ah when you think of disney taking all of their business to the third world countries and not even paying them giving them what is it two cents an hour 

234.22 236.67 A: (( money )) 

242.61 244.76 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

243.35 246.35 B: and threatening to leave if they ask for a penny more 

246.27 258.49 B: it's a a yeah there's there's a there's a a depletion of the of the human spirit unfortunately and ah and i think it's very inevitably of the of the of the ah ah of those people who oppose 

258.33 271.23 B: a [mn] a a a raise in the in minimum wage ah i i don't buy well if if the market doesn't bear it then those people will get out of the market that's not what life's about anymore it's just not there's too much competition and and they'll 

271.14 281.33 B: get people from other countries to do it for half the amount well that's not good enough i think there's got to be start being embargoes there's got to be some real rates to pay 

276.41 279.15 A: (( yeah )) 

281.30 288.59 B: at ah at the import level and i i truly believe that we should push the minimum wage up to ten bucks i really do 

288.00 295.89 A: yeah i i would really like to see that but unfortunately i'm a bit too pessimistic to see that happening yeah 

292.74 299.15 B: no it's not going to happen and you're right it's not going to happen because they'll all be complaining and moaning and groaning and pissing about 

298.95 310.29 B: the cost factor i mean you look at look at like guys who are disney made something like two hundred fifty million dollars as a bonus on top of the six hundred fifty thousand dollar a year salary and he says no we're not going to give a penny raise 

300.18 301.85 A: yeah 

310.16 311.79 A: yeah 

310.17 314.30 B: to the people working in the sweat ships in haiti it just doesn't it 

312.22 318.95 A: it's like how much money is too much you know how much do they have to have before they've got enough 

314.65 315.85 B: yeah well 

316.78 317.47 B: (( they )) 

318.05 321.36 B: you know i don't even ask those questions anymore because they don't care 

321.18 322.60 A: exactly 

321.85 325.59 B: they don't even see that money they don't even give a damn it's just the power 

325.36 337.50 B: that goes with the making of that kind of money and they lose sight of the ah they lose sight of the human spirit so i'm all for the the the raise in the minimum wage and i'd like to see it go up to ten i'd like to see it go up to twenty an hour 

337.55 343.19 B: you know i really would and i think most people can afford it big business can afford it they just don't want to do it so 

342.45 345.58 A: exactly they don't want to cut into their bottom line 

343.50 344.82 B: just don't want to do it 

345.35 352.48 B: yeah and i think and ah anyway if you did it if you did it on on in terms of ah ah if you regulate it to some degree of course it would be hard the 

352.35 365.67 B: government would have to has a hard enough time regulating themselves and the president much less anything else ah then you could regulate so your small business doesn't have to pay that a smaller business depending upon it's input and it's output etcetera and gross and and net 

365.60 369.81 B: doesn't have to pay that kind of money they can pay a little bit less and that's up to the individual 

369.55 370.86 A: right 

370.47 377.64 B: but i think you know today it's n- nowadays it doesn't work it doesn't pay to work for a solid rate i think everybody should get into the business of 

377.66 382.20 B: waiting and waitresses and and waiters and and ah and ah 

382.06 394.24 B: ah representative ah commission you know doing commission work ah shoveling ah product at whatever it was so they don't have to declare half their money to the government i you know they've set up a an an atmosphere of cheating i'm all for it 

385.64 386.24 A: (( right )) 

390.12 393.15 A: mhm 

394.15 395.81 A: yeah 

394.93 396.80 B: to survive that's what you've got to do 

396.88 410.16 A: i i agree with that i mean with the with the amount of special interest groups that are lobbying in in the government ah to get all these these tax cuts and and special benefit packages for them just so they can you know further 

398.31 399.45 B: (( oh yeah )) 

407.75 408.66 B: yeah 

410.07 415.65 A: repress their workers i mean look at walmart there's a prime example of what's happening in this country mhm 

413.21 427.83 B: oh good example good example absolutely i know the the all the warmth of walmart is about as warm as as a an ice cube i mean it absolutely absolutely makes no sense at all no i i agree with you i and of course we've got a president that ah 

421.04 421.62 A: (( [mn] ah )) 

427.76 432.04 B: that bends for that he he believes in it so 

429.65 437.59 A: yeah i think you know we've seen pretty well with with reagan that the whole trickle down theory doesn't work that well 

436.78 439.50 B: no sure doesn't doesn't work 

437.84 441.95 A: you know but ah it they just don't seem to want to get it through their heads they 

441.02 441.58 B: (( [mn] )) 

441.91 442.65 B: no 

442.11 449.29 A: i guess their their friends are a little too influential to them and ah we don't really matter as much yeah 

448.22 454.21 B: well let's face it ah we've got oil interests now in iraq so ah you know so much for the minimum wage 

451.05 452.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

454.59 456.74 B: that's why we're there i mean that's 

455.73 458.04 A: look over here here's a distraction 

457.93 466.31 B: yeah [laughter] yeah that's exactly what it is well you and i agree and i think let's see ah you be president and i'll be vice president and we can handle this 

458.83 462.51 A: [laughter] 

466.38 470.26 A: [laughter] i don't know if i'm ready for that kind of ah power but 

468.93 471.42 B: are you are you working at that aluminium place 

471.09 477.28 A: ah ah no and actually ah i'm i'm back in college again and hoping to finish up this time 

476.46 478.18 B: oh great what are you taking 

478.15 482.25 A: actually i'm taking a concentration in ah digital art 

481.69 486.91 B: well great that's ah that's ah so that would that be digital art would that be like animation 

486.85 491.33 A: ah hopefully three d. modeling computer animation that sort of thing 

489.85 492.96 B: great well i do a series called rugrats 

492.68 494.45 A: oh yeah 

493.12 503.67 B: and yeah and all this stuff here is ah i i you know they started that up a little bit it copped some hand drawings but for the most part most of the stuff i do i see all the artists are working in digital ah 

503.66 508.73 B: computers and do a lot of interactive games and that's a lot of digital it's all digital actually 

508.62 512.22 A: that sounds great yeah i'm hoping to get into 

510.08 515.65 B: so it's a and it's a great business a smart business it's a it's very very lucrative and ah 

515.42 525.37 B: it's insulated ah in in your level of it if you wind up getting into ah into ah ah interactive games but it's it's it's taking off like crazy 

525.15 528.92 A: yeah it's definitely a growing market i mean it's 

528.00 533.01 B: it's a major market it's a major market it's going to affect my screen actor's guild ah 

533.09 547.62 B: ah tremendously ah they're they're not aware of it but i'm making them aware of it now and ah and you know everyone fights everyone fights at a different level in terms of minimum wage for years we worked at a minimum wage and we went on strike and and they said look we're we're a special group of people so if you 

543.30 543.92 A: (( mm )) 

547.60 553.08 B: want to go some place else go and just don't pay us and so they wound up raising our salaries which was great 

552.24 562.78 A: oh that's that's definitely a a plus to being in a a skilled position whereas you know the vast majority of people are in unskilled positions and they really don't have any kind of leverage to do that 

556.67 558.32 B: oh yeah 

560.07 561.02 B: well i 

562.52 576.41 B: no they don't they absolutely don't you stay in that position you put yourself in the position and you stay in that position like say if if you become a digital artist an animated artist what you want to do is you want to come up with your own conceptions much less doing what the boss wants you to do which is fine you do your job 

576.25 583.23 B: but come up with your own ideas and you wind up directing your own show and you wind up creating your own ah interactive game and that's where you make the money 

582.85 584.47 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

584.96 586.19 A: definitely 

586.19 591.70 B: so ah anyway you and i um i mean we're on the same wavelength and i don't know what else to say 

591.24 597.59 A: yeah i was ah i was pretty shocked i didn't think too many people actually shared my viewpoint but ah 

597.86 599.89 A: i'm not sure how many of them are actually
