48.67 49.46 B: said 

48.68 55.48 A: oh what the whole purpose of this is to gather uh voice information so that they can build a computer programme 

55.94 58.22 B: and and do what with that 

57.63 62.29 A: um pretty much just be able to talk into the computer and have it write i guess 

61.70 67.25 B: oh and have it have it be able to respond back or or to to to write words out 

66.67 72.15 A: yeah something like that i'm not i didn't ask too many questions you know but 

67.76 68.70 B: huh 

71.34 74.51 B: no i didn't either they just said they were going to pay ten dollars and 

74.51 75.62 A: yeah that's 

75.28 79.87 B: [laughter] and i said well i'll i'll talk for ten minutes for ten dollars what the difference 

79.60 80.85 A: yeah 

80.99 88.22 B: but ex i thought they uh said that you had to talk that you had to talk about the the uh the uh uh subject wherever it's at 

87.65 93.26 A: oh well you think that you'd lie in court for a good friend 

92.45 94.47 B: uh no i don't think so 

94.76 98.10 A: i don't know it depends on what it is i 

98.29 104.13 B: i di- i i don't think i'd well i don't think i have anybody i know who would end up getting locked up but 

104.05 104.93 A: yeah 

105.00 107.63 B: i usually figure if you do the crime you do the time 

106.82 109.58 A: well 

109.69 110.70 A: (( i don't know )) 

110.77 115.15 A: i don't really can't really come up with any situations where i would need to you know 

114.92 116.22 B: yeah 

115.62 119.43 A: but i don't know i'd have to think about it you know 

119.58 120.90 B: where you live at 

120.72 123.24 A: um i'm out here in virginia 

122.66 125.11 B: really i'm in new jersey that's pretty wild 

124.91 125.54 A: mm 

125.51 128.31 B: and i think the college that's doing this is in pennsylvania 

128.39 129.20 A: mm 'kay 

128.89 135.77 B: right in thinks the university of penn at least that's that's was who where i had signed up at uh that answered some ad on the radio station for it 

135.16 139.23 A: yeah i think that's what it is it's somewhere up there so 

138.95 141.48 B: is that the same way you heard about this thing 

140.86 148.94 A: uh no actually my dad did it and he heard about it from his sister and so it's just travelling straight through my family 

146.81 147.54 B: did 

148.28 151.25 B: passing along everybody getting a chance to make a few bucks 

150.78 152.52 A: yeah 

151.78 153.82 B: man what's the weather like in virginia 

153.82 157.53 A: uh kind of cool but it's pretty nice outside 

156.94 158.00 B: not raining 

157.88 158.68 A: no 

158.41 161.97 B: it's been raining here for crazy for days and days 

162.11 166.05 A: i don't know you could say that it's raining i've been washing my dog so [laughter] 

165.49 166.74 B: oh huh 

167.22 168.37 B: no it's uh 

169.43 176.87 B: been raining here for a for a long time now it's stopped raining pretty pretty much it's just overcast but 

174.26 174.97 A: mm 

176.72 177.56 A: (( i know )) 

178.71 180.70 B: did you make other calls with this 

180.39 182.34 A: yeah this is my last one 

182.00 183.32 B: oh really 

182.64 185.15 A: yeah this will be my third 

184.67 186.61 B: this is the first one that i did 

186.72 187.43 A: (( oh )) 

187.22 190.23 B: i just figured i'd see what it was like 'cause i didn't have anything to do 

190.06 191.12 A: [laughter] 

191.14 197.10 A: nah you get paid like ten dollars each call and you can only make like three of them that you get paid for so 

198.31 203.68 B: and then what they're going to just what take everybody's like words and and copy them into a computer 

203.23 206.54 A: yeah i guess that's how it works they're just recording our 

206.61 208.02 A: (( words [mn] )) 

209.00 210.36 A: i'm not sure 

210.59 215.78 A: this it seems awful funny 'cause then they'd have to ask somebody type up what we're talking about you know 

215.54 221.06 B: yeah wha- and who would care about that it's just babble back and forth 

216.46 217.26 A: so 

220.87 222.93 A: yeah well 

223.36 224.72 A: (( you know how it is so )) 

225.21 230.12 A: all those big companies whatever they do they throw around money like it's nothing you know 

229.61 231.68 B: uh you think a company's paying for it 

231.80 235.24 A: i think that it's probably a company behind this yeah 

235.62 241.31 B: [noise] uh i i ju- i thought it was being done by the university of penn i figured it was something to do with the college 

240.60 249.11 A: i think that the university of penn is probably doing the major part of it but i think that it's probably being sponsored by a company in exchange for the information 

248.72 251.66 B: oh okay they're paying them to do the work 

251.08 253.30 A: that's what i figure 'cause i don't think the 

253.29 266.84 A: university would spend this kind of money on something just for the research it's if you think about it they're contacting people across the u._s. paying for that phone bill paying us the ten dollar a dollar a minute you know 

266.42 267.87 B: yeah 

267.30 270.45 A: that's a lot of money flowing around for just a 

269.81 272.96 B: yeah i had no idea it would stretched all over the country 

272.31 275.57 A: [mn] yeah see it goes all over the place 

276.44 277.25 A: so 

277.02 282.45 B: and i just i just dialed into a number and everything and then it said hold on and we'll find somebody to talk to 

282.46 284.99 A: oh you called them oh 

283.59 286.20 B: yeah what did they do they called you 

285.85 287.74 A: yeah they always call me 

287.17 291.11 B: oh how about that so they gave me a number and said to call 

288.35 289.94 A: (( yeah )) 

290.87 292.10 A: yeah 

291.66 295.36 B: i dialed this number and then i and i put in a pin number 

295.81 297.47 B: and then it says they'll 

297.68 299.66 B: hold on while they find somebody 

300.34 307.04 B: and i just figured they had like people dialing into the computer and then just sort of sitting there waiting till two people dial in 

306.97 315.80 A: huh no they've got like oh i've been contacted this is my third time and i've never had to wait more than like ten seconds for another person 

315.40 318.24 B: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

318.33 324.70 A: so they've got to be like calling like twenty people every little so often you know 

324.02 326.58 B: but they they never instructed you to call 

326.77 332.76 A: um they might have left something but the major part that they wanted to know was when they could call me 

332.20 334.39 B: how about that 

333.00 338.37 A: yeah and they're pretty good about it they only call when in the times that i left for them and all so 

338.16 342.69 B: well they they must have must be taking like half of the people calling and saying you call 

343.06 343.74 A: mm 

343.16 349.02 B: and then like when like if i called in and they just put me on hold while they call up you or somebody else 

349.02 350.05 A: (( i don't know )) 

349.67 351.56 B: and then connect it together 

352.15 358.66 A: i know you did it via like the phone you called them in all right i did mine through the internet 

356.22 357.36 B: yeah 

359.11 361.37 A: that's how i started up with it 

361.30 362.33 B: really 

361.77 363.86 A: yeah i just went online and registered 

364.34 369.53 B: huh no i i read an advertisement when i was working i heard an advertisement on the radio 

369.97 374.16 B: for it and it had a number an eight eight hundred number so i called that number 

374.24 375.92 A: so what do you do for work 

375.74 377.33 B: i build houses 

376.87 378.23 A: oh that's pretty cool 

378.13 381.20 B: it's all right better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick 

380.62 382.37 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

381.74 383.04 B: (( what do you do for work )) 

383.15 393.68 A: oh i right now i'm a little bit in between things i work at the movie theatre and uh i've been working for a surveying team what i usually do is i do cad work 

393.48 397.35 B: oh yeah surveying is a black art 

394.18 395.92 A: yeah bunch of 

397.33 398.21 A: why 

397.90 406.76 B: [laughter] guy looks through a little looks through a little tripod mounted de- device and says this is where you are on the planet [laughter] i think it's hocus pocus 

406.76 413.97 A: um they don't really do that much with the companies that i deal we don't do too much with world orientation 

413.36 414.22 B: no 

414.11 420.98 A: most of what we do is just uh relative to where you are and figuring out where your property is 

420.39 421.77 B: right 

421.17 428.00 A: but i think it's kind of funny 'cause i work for a surveying company and i also work for a soils conservation company 

427.42 428.59 B: oh really 

428.17 437.47 A: so and when i go to work for one people i'm working to put up um like subdivisions and when i go do the work for the other people i'm working uh 

437.25 438.79 B: working against it 

438.25 440.63 A: (( yeah [laughter] so )) 

440.19 441.41 B: tree hugging 

441.06 442.83 A: yeah 

441.85 444.04 B: yeah that's pretty uh that's pretty funny 

444.05 445.31 A: (( so i don't )) 

444.33 449.94 B: now just when they come out to a job and they set up their equipment and everything and look around and say now here's the property line 

450.12 450.88 A: yeah 

450.22 452.40 B: yeah okay sure 

452.26 463.99 A: i don't know when when it gets to the point where you're having to deal with them they've already done all the surveying already but they're going in it's just telling you what's what's happening you know 

459.92 460.75 B: yeah 

464.77 475.38 A: the major surveying is when they go out and it's just woods and they come up and they okay here's the pins that we found what do we need to put in the ground what's fake what's not you know 

472.79 473.83 B: right 

476.34 484.87 A: 'cause i mean you'll come across like kids go walking through the m- woods and they'll see a little concrete thing on the ground oh what's this you know we'll kick it over you know 

484.80 486.78 B: kick it move it throw it 

486.21 492.09 A: yeah i know and surveyor comes out later on probably see it off you know 

492.59 493.28 B: (( [cough] [mn] )) 

494.12 498.26 B: i know all they're always talking about oh got to find the control i got to find the control 

498.11 499.39 A: (( yeah well )) 

499.57 504.36 A: that's j- a control is just a fancy name for a pin that they used to set up on 

504.02 504.91 B: right 

505.12 505.90 A: (( so )) 

505.40 507.46 B: (( one that they think that they know where it is )) 

507.17 520.95 A: yeah one something that is relatively constant you know it shouldn't have moved or anything like that everything in surveying is relative all the epicenter and 

521.49 525.90 B: they have some uh thing called the u._s. geological survey point or 

525.54 533.91 A: yeah the u._s._g._s. point those are i don't know i've also done a lot of work with a um it's not c._a._d. it's another kind of programme uh 

527.31 528.53 B: yeah 

534.48 538.02 A: shoot what is the name of that i've worked with something for 

538.10 544.49 A: but this other programme it's basically just for overlaying maps and seeing how they orientate to each other 

544.18 545.10 B: uh-huh 

544.99 547.19 A: and if you look at the 

547.64 559.55 A: equip- the the information that they have on the u._s. it's pretty accurate if you think about it in terms of just like feet and stuff like 'cause the roads will be like a foot off or something like that 

558.97 560.24 B: right 

559.61 561.96 A: but for surveying it's nothing you know 

562.36 572.08 A: but it's pretty good for if you have like a huge survey of like a hundred acres or something like that you can just go out there and ju- like it should be approximately here you know so 

571.90 572.63 B: mm 

574.46 579.59 B: [cough] well being a foot off can make some people pretty aggravated if they lost a foot of their property 

579.15 583.66 A: well when you're working with like a hundred acres and whatnot it's usually with um 

583.51 594.28 A: soils conservation and with like wetlands and stuff like that to where if wetlands are going to change probably a few feet over the next hundred years you know 

594.25 595.35 B: yeah 

594.70 595.87 A: (( so it's )) 

595.37 598.10 B: w- what do you consider wetlands there 

598.04 599.89 A: um wetlands would be
