214.77 216.15 B: right 

215.39 219.29 A: there's so many things you could talk about there's so many ways you could like you 

219.71 229.13 A: know let's let's keep the you keep the situa- i mean keep a bad situation make a little better than it really w- what really happened and um or [mn] people get over stuff you know what i mean 

228.87 239.92 B: yeah yeah i know it's um it was even difficult after nine eleven i know david letterman had some trouble getting back into y- you know to the swing of things but uh 

234.07 234.98 A: mhm 

239.20 241.04 A: mhm 

240.00 249.89 B: um did you ever see this um uh newspaper on the streets [mn] i don't i don't buy it but occasionally i pick it up 'cause it's free it's called the onion do 

250.14 251.34 A: what oh 

250.22 252.81 B: you have that do you have that in phila-

253.51 254.91 B: yeah 

254.39 258.56 A: you know i think i've i've seen it before what what uh was it it's like a free paper 

258.02 271.82 B: yeah it's it's a weekly paper uh on humor and um i kn- i know they're originally from uh i don't know maybe they were from wisconsin but they moved a couple of years ago to new york and they're giving it away 

258.96 259.84 A: okay 

260.85 261.83 A: mhm 

262.08 263.06 A: right 

271.75 283.70 B: on the streets for free and you can actually get it on the internet too um that to me some of the stories in the onion i mean i i don't you know i i check it out maybe once every few weeks 

283.66 284.62 A: mhm 

283.90 286.13 B: and some of those stories are 

286.28 289.73 B: are bad in my in my view bad taste because 

289.75 295.94 B: um i just read the the um the main story from not this week from last week 

295.86 306.39 B: and to to give you an idea what i consider bad taste uh it says general tommy franks quits army to pursue solo bombing projects 

298.98 300.06 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

306.18 307.74 A: [laughter] right 

307.28 310.73 B: well it's funny in a way but i mean you know somebody's [mn] 

309.83 310.45 A: (( [laughter] )) 

310.59 320.24 B: somebody's gonna get bombed somebody's gonna gonna kill wh- you know wh- when the general bombs people i know that they make they're poking fun at tommy franks and the pentagon 

315.83 317.13 A: right 

320.09 328.60 B: but you know it's really um you know to poke fun at war is [laughter] is uh is a fine line you know 

320.13 321.10 A: mhm 

324.91 326.05 A: (( [laughter] yeah [mn] )) 

328.12 342.26 A: right i hear you well yeah you gotta like before you gotta draw a line i guess somewhere you know what i mean i guess it's a matter of ju- of a judgement thing to some peo- i guess sometimes because some if something really gets some type of can't be joked about 

332.01 333.11 B: yeah 

341.65 343.25 B: yeah 

342.67 349.42 A: you know i guess uh me i look at a person you're joking about with whereas i don't think you want to joke about poverty with someone who lives in the ghetto 

349.12 350.29 B: that's true 

350.09 351.95 A: you know and then 

352.12 356.97 A: i don't think you want to joke about you know impotence or someone who takes viagra you [laughter] know 

356.75 361.90 B: well [laughter] they do and if they're a famous person like bob dole or something like 

357.72 358.94 A: [laughter] 

361.23 367.24 A: right right well right not somebody who known for that and that probably cancel out somebody who's probably went public with it 

363.43 364.92 B: (( that yeah )) 

366.55 380.50 B: exactly exactly that's the that's the main thing if somebody is leaving it leading a public life like a a politician or a celebrity i think they're fair game for just about anything [laughter] exactly 

371.95 372.93 A: mhm 

375.06 376.07 A: mhm 

378.55 385.35 A: right right right but that goes right they're right we- well that shows them that they they at they got a high you know uh tolerance for 

385.11 386.53 B: (( mhm )) 

385.90 394.81 A: about anything like that well you make it i mean you making seven figures a year or whatever i mean what the hell [mn] i guess you okay with whatever we say you know what i mean what if 

393.46 400.78 B: [mn] well [mn] [laughter] yeah right i i'm sure they they're bothered by it but they really can't do anything about it hopefully they have a sense of humor 

400.63 409.80 A: yeah [mn] well yeah a sense of humor but you know i guess they can take a laugh 'cause some kind of way they might as well you know that you might have 

400.79 402.36 B: a- about it 

407.25 408.40 B: exactly 

409.98 411.43 A: [mn] basically you might have you 

412.25 420.30 A: know a sponsor picked up on that and the next thing you know they sign up some big endorsement 'cause of the 'cause of the what's what probably think about a a statement of me in public 

420.20 421.43 B: mhm 

420.70 425.93 A: y- you know or anything like that you know i'm for example i'm pretty sure you know like you 

426.24 429.28 A: know like o- okay like on com- like some comedies 

429.37 430.52 A: (( um )) 

431.48 437.07 A: that some comedies you know they always have generally have there's always a person on there who's not too bright 

436.48 437.36 B: (( mm )) 

437.33 440.34 A: then they have some person on there that might be sexually 

440.52 443.84 A: you know uh um when i say they might be like [mn] 

443.96 446.68 A: not interested in sex or they might be oversexed

450.49 451.61 B: right 

458.01 462.45 A: they looked at that all wrong that that show ran for ten years or twelve years 

461.85 475.34 B: right i think they call that situational comedies right yeah i i i've watched them before but they're not my favorites 'cause they they get tired after a while you know it's the same formula same jokes and and week after week 

464.45 466.74 A: (( yes situation comedy right you know )) 

472.63 479.67 A: (( yeah same jokes right week after week yeah you know you can sense a joke joke coming )) 

479.31 481.31 B: mhm 

480.40 484.87 A: (( [mn] my guess i don't know i guess you know on t._v. and it's it's happening you ))
