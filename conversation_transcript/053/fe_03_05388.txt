86.69 87.98 A: oh yeah yeah 

87.11 96.21 B: taking taking the family out yeah [noise] yeah [noise] yeah [mn] yeah 

88.61 90.99 A: [laughter] so [laughter] 

91.96 105.74 A: so per- yeah so the whole perjury thing uh yeah i think i'm pretty much on the board that i probably would not [laughter] participate in that uh just 'cause morally i don't believe in lying but i mean if it was something very minor and i don't know i might 

98.45 101.39 B: (( yeah )) 

101.78 105.91 B: yeah that's true yeah 

105.72 110.49 A: might be willing to bend but for the general part i don't think i would it'd have to be something you 

107.01 121.28 B: yeah exactly yeah yeah well that that happened to uh like my wife uh we were at the target shopping center 

111.60 117.40 A: know if it's a speeding ticket you know it might be slightly [laughter] different [laughter] but uh 

120.90 121.87 A: uh-huh 

121.59 130.61 B: then we back we were backing out and uh what happened was a lady was looking for la- la- lady [mn] was you know just driving right right behind us and uh she just uh 

130.68 134.61 B: we actually kind a hit her but she was in a hurry too going really fast 

134.28 135.52 A: mhm 

134.86 143.11 B: you know like uh when we were backing out of the parking lot this lady was just driving like a maniac and the next thing we hit her accidentally and you know and she goes oh 

143.27 150.63 B: trying to sue us and everything here and uh we told her well let's e- exchange the insurance and everything and after we call triple a 

150.68 160.89 B: and uh also there was no scratch because it was lightly bumped but uh she say there was a big scratch [laughter] the whole time and she just uh you know trying to get money from us and uh yes she did 

158.30 169.60 A: so she lied well that's iro- it's i- it's ironic that you mention that because because uh that's what i do for a living i work for farmers insurance and i actually [laughter] and i actually ha- i handle a lot of claims [laughter] 

161.66 167.74 B: yeah yeah oh is that right yeah that was a 

168.68 174.39 B: yeah i ha- had uh triple a you know like account and we have a triple a but uh this lady's anyway's hit us and we're 

174.49 182.21 B: uh we told her there there's uh maybe a little scratch you can just use a rubbing compound to wipe it off it's not that big [noise] but that the um 

182.52 196.93 B: anyway's we called our insurance uh claim and find out it's actually her fault too because she was speeding through you know a twenty five mile zone i mean a five mile zone there then uh then uh we had the letter that fifty fifty it's our fault and their fault so we got we got away 

190.60 191.44 A: yeah 

197.26 202.98 B: so we got actually lucky even though we bumped into her yeah 

199.86 203.27 A: so so you both had you both had triple a insurance 

203.07 217.87 B: yeah uh no she had uh different insurance some uh a. i. s. or something you know it's something like that yeah so so i got lucky from there because she was saying that it's gonna cost thousand dollars trying to scare us and everything and fixing her car and you know but uh 

206.61 210.56 A: oh okay so they did fifty fifty that's pretty [mn] without any 

210.90 212.04 A: yeah without 

216.94 222.34 A: yeah because she would have to spend an equal amount of money as you did in order for her to get it so that's stops 'em yeah 

219.21 221.75 B: exactly yeah 

222.26 226.07 B: (( yeah but but yeah but )) 

222.41 228.69 A: i deal with that quite a bit lot of peo- lot of per- lot of perjury in the insurance [laughter] business [laughter] 

227.43 231.25 B: that's true yeah and she could also just uh you know 

231.28 238.42 B: and she could've just say that she was like uh uh you know uh what is that that she could say her back hurts and all that and she could've lied too you know 

238.48 239.31 A: yeah 

238.58 244.73 B: just just to get you know like uh time off from her work plus uh you know get extra money and stuff 

244.69 252.25 A: but you gotta back you gotta be able to back it up there's a lot of denial lot of denials i used to do inves- i used to do investigations parking lot is the worst 

244.96 250.81 B: yeah yeah definitely yeah 

251.19 256.53 B: yeah yeah then uh [mn] luckily my wife uh she forgot her 

256.80 260.98 B: but uh you know she didn't ask for it she asked 

261.78 276.41 B: insurance information you know they just exchange them we were lucky that that time 'cause actually she didn't have her driver license and uh the police came we would've been in trouble because she forgot it you know [mn] so we were fortunate yeah that's the one thing that happened uh you know 

266.28 267.18 A: yeah
