0.35 2.31 A: uh my name is paul 

2.99 5.03 B: my name is kirby 

5.33 6.79 A: was that scarby 

6.96 9.00 B: kirby k. i. r. b. y. 

9.08 11.72 A: okay i used to have a dentist with that first name 

12.16 22.83 B: [laughter] oh really [laughter] okay so they uh they said the topic of of conversation is supposed to be [mn] if we had one million dollars would we leave the country i just wanted to verify that with you 

22.99 28.83 A: um i could not understand the robot voice on my phone so whatever you tell me it is i'll believe you 

29.39 35.94 B: oh okay well that that was the topic uh if you had uh one million dollars uh would you leave [mn] the country 

34.10 34.92 A: yeah 

35.85 48.85 B: so i mean definitely [mn] uh i would i mean [laughter] because i could think of uh places where the cost of living would be a lot less and so it would be like more like one probably one p- one point five million dollars 

48.81 54.35 A: yeah uh more than that i mean like the places where i would go like south east asia 

54.73 65.05 A: but um i you know i read the topics on the website and i think they said that if you had the million dollars like if you were paid a million dollars but never allowed to come back to america 

54.98 55.74 B: (( mm )) 

65.23 67.27 B: oh okay 

66.46 70.26 A: um that's that's what i read uh uh on the website if um 

70.60 71.56 A: (( [laughter] um )) 

71.58 76.49 A: that would change things i i think the question is would you accept that 

76.67 78.84 B: yeah i would yes mm 

78.95 85.35 B: so i i definitely would and uh and then it said you know what would i what would i miss the most gee 

85.45 99.92 B: uh [mn] i guess i would uh probably m- miss uh since i'm living right now in san francisco i think i would just miss the weather the most it would be hard to find a even a microclimate that would be like uh the weather i have here so 

99.93 109.77 B: that would probably be the hardest thing i couldn't imagine uh uh any place else that probably had the same whereas th- the closest would probably santiago in chile i understand so uh 

107.78 108.47 A: (( mm )) 

109.81 120.20 B: and uh so i i i could always find a use for money [laughter] i have no problem being able to spend it but i think i [mn] i think i would re- reinvest uh 

120.15 127.04 B: i would put most of it in a high yield bond fund to make sure i was basically living off my interest or the dividends instead of the principal 

127.06 132.90 B: probably's what i would do immediately because um uh if i was making 

127.25 128.23 A: high yield 

132.99 140.81 B: six percent off of a million dollars that would bec- that would be enough for me to live comfortably because i'm not married don't have any kids so that would be f- fine with me 

141.36 145.03 A: six percent that would be about sixty thousand yeah that'd go a long way i can 

143.80 144.36 B: (( [mn] )) 

144.81 150.15 B: yeah really [laughter] more than i'm [laughter] making [laughter] 

145.14 147.78 A: in in certain certain countries yeah 

149.54 156.38 A: well that's pretty amazing i'm calling from second street near market right where the rare mcnally book store is 

156.76 161.43 B: oh really and you and and you can use that t- telephone number for the uh 

157.77 159.56 A: yeah 

161.54 165.06 B: okay for this question okay that's very interesting okay 

164.13 170.90 A: i don't know if they if i don't know if they intended to match people close by geographically or what but i'm right here in san francisco too 

171.17 175.61 B: well it's all computer driven so that probably has something to do with it but uh 

175.69 185.22 B: [mn] so what would you miss the most if you if uh you couldn't you know uh if you someone gave you a million dollars and you left the country you couldn't go back go back what would you miss the most 

184.82 195.52 A: oh just the people that i that i that i know and i have known i mean you know family and friends and of course if you had a million dollars you could probably pay for people to come out to visit but it's um 

196.43 198.04 B: yeah that's true 

196.81 197.90 A: (( the other [mn] )) 

198.38 205.42 A: i i don't know about the weather though i i'm not yeah i mean i like the moderate weather here but uh i i always liked hot weather 

205.81 209.17 A: thailand you know like vietnam better um that part of the world 

209.37 212.98 A: i li- i actually like i actually like the ninety degree weather 

209.62 210.83 B: oh really 

213.25 225.73 B: oh i don't i left i left the south to get away from hot humid weather so that would be the least place i would want to live i would probably rather live in a desert than anywhere it's hot or humid uh so uh 

226.64 232.81 B: [mn] you know that that's um [mn] that's such a a difficult subject to talk about for ten minutes because like uh 

232.71 245.18 B: [mn] you know i guess th- the question you know the question being if if you had someone gave you a million dollars and you would uh what you know if if you left the country did not come back you know that's that's that's that's what you say is was on the website 

244.95 246.97 A: that's what that's what i read on the website 

245.53 251.38 B: [mn] well yeah well [mn] y- you know you could with that kind of capital though you could still 

251.71 266.61 B: and and if th- and the world [mn] basically much smaller than it is i mean you you know [mn] if you had that kind of capital there's really nothing that you cannot have shipped to you you know wherever you lived i mean you could probably live in the middle of the sahara desert in a oasis uh 

266.54 271.64 B: in this in um libya or uh morocco or [laughter] something 

271.80 275.93 B: and probably still get sh- d. h. l. to ship something to you so 

275.86 287.28 B: i can't y- you know it's [mn] once you have so much capital it's just [mn] i would think it's a state of mind uh yeah but i'm a social person i couldn't live i could not live where 

276.06 277.54 A: yeah 

287.75 289.00 B: uh 

289.34 302.22 B: there there was not a lot of people around so hm so i guess uh i i guess santiago chile probably would be good for me it would be very much like san francisco you know if i guess i guess if i could prove that probably santiago in chile 

291.54 293.29 A: yeah yeah mm 

302.55 310.82 B: oh gee prob- i wo- i would i would like to i'd like berlin uh i i would i could see myself in berlin 

307.63 308.49 A: uh-huh 

310.92 311.87 A: (( mhm )) 

311.22 317.38 B: uh i'd have to be some place very cosmopolitan like san francisco too i think yeah something's very cosmopolitan 

317.78 320.10 B: um some- um 

320.23 325.03 B: something with a lot of good restaurants and [mn] culture 

326.46 331.01 B: uh some place where it had some kind of decent medical care and clean water 

326.67 328.39 A: yeah 

331.41 332.32 A: yeah 

331.71 335.82 B: so uh i hope that doesn't leave santiago chile out i don't know if their water's clean or not 

336.07 337.57 B: uh so 

337.74 340.27 B: where where would you where would you think that you would go 

340.04 343.86 A: well of course even here people drink bottled water some people do [laughter] 

344.33 354.24 B: oh that's so silly because we get our water from hetch hetchy dam like it's just really nothing but mountain water it's really yeah it's really fu- funny i that funny 

344.47 345.67 A: yeah me uh 

350.39 352.20 A: yeah 

353.39 355.05 A: i usually drink tap water 

355.12 356.07 B: yeah 

355.29 357.02 A: (( uh me i'd um )) 

357.08 361.92 A: i i mean i lived in asia for many most of the nineteen nineties i was teaching english i'd 

362.14 364.12 A: um go back in that region 

364.92 375.84 B: do you work there at the at the uh store i mean there [mn] rare mcnally 'cause i think it's so funny that you can make the call from from work you can do this from work oh they called you at work 

372.44 374.92 A: well they called me they called me u- 

375.88 384.89 A: um no i wasn't even at work um um you know um i was at a book signing um you know uh dick morris uh clinton's old advisor was 

385.32 389.64 A: um giving a speech um selling his book so i just went to hear what he had to say 

389.95 397.98 A: and that that was over at stacey's book store and then as i was leaving i was getting on my motor scooter parked and the phone rang just as i was getting ready to leave 

398.26 401.00 B: oh how strange wow okay 

401.33 403.79 B: well uh so 

404.33 413.57 B: mm gee now when i c- let's see [lipsmack] hm i wonder why they phrase the question well you cannot come back to the country oh boy hm well 

412.75 417.95 A: well no it's like would would you accept the million dollars and you know would would it be worth it for you to uh 

418.96 425.17 B: okay so if i if i accepted the mill- if i accepted the million dollars i'd have to agree not to be able to come back to the country i think that was 

424.36 425.43 A: (( i think [mn] i )) 

425.39 427.13 B: that was the question right 

425.76 429.32 A: think that's what i r- i think that's what i read yeah yeah 

427.98 441.22 B: okay well i could live with that i mean there's no problem living with that as long as you know as long as there's no torture involved or anything harmful to me [laughter] i could live with that you know if people really have a 

437.99 439.66 A: yeah 

441.27 444.49 B: uh people are really chasing down [mn] 

445.09 457.92 B: uh try- uh living all the time i mean i [mn] it is i do find it stressful i i you know i f- i i find that working nine to five can be very stressful so i would [mn] like i say uh i'm i'm pretty 

457.87 460.40 B: good at um 

461.00 471.78 B: i'm pretty good at money i'm i'm a i'm a retired financial investment adviser you know so i'm pretty good you know i'm pretty g- i have a good idea what i would do with capital if i had it if i had the capital i know what i would do it with 

465.50 466.67 A: oh 

471.57 476.34 B: you know and and ultimately i've got no problem at all just thinking i would just take the money right away 

476.36 487.69 B: and put it like in a high yield bond fund and then live off the dividends because the only a high yield bond fund would give you that kind of dividend but well let's say that [mn] until recently the dividends on a high yield bond fund was like 

487.63 501.76 B: twelve or thirteen percent so even if the worst happened and i had a dividend yield go down to even five percent i would be very comfortable [laughter] i would be very comfortable no matter where i lived [laughter] i would be quite comfortable [laughter] [laughter] 

496.07 496.87 A: yeah 

499.35 500.67 A: (( yeah it it's )) 

501.11 508.68 A: yeah i guess that th- that would be pretty safe and it's like i mean the interest uh you know the bank's pay like half a percent half or one percent interest 

507.27 515.12 B: oh yeah that's crazy yeah defin- yeah even uh money markets and even c._d.s are crazy now uh you really 

508.98 510.50 A: unbelievable 

515.14 520.81 B: uh that that would be so stupid so i i could definitely [lipsmack] live with that um 

520.90 522.68 A: yeah my friend's 

521.29 525.68 B: i could definitely figure out some way to get more return than than that 

525.10 531.67 A: yeah my friend was just last night was telling me about investing in houses in sacramento he's saying you know like they're 

525.90 526.92 B: uh 

531.75 535.02 A: they're affordable and they're going up in appreciation 

535.94 547.79 B: mm well i i couldn't uh uh i really w- wonder why people would want to live in the cen- center of california when there's so many nice places you could live near to the ocean i've always found that very strange myself 

547.82 561.55 B: uh definitely uh uh being near the ocean everything's much nice than being out in the central valley in california oh god i couldn't imagine that so [mn] um we got to stay on topic here so i don't want to get off the topic uh 

547.99 549.14 A: yeah 

554.95 556.00 A: yeah 

561.55 570.18 B: gee um hm [lipsmack] well definitely if i if and if i had that kind of capital too i would be able to sit down literally with 

570.64 582.21 B: a legal pad and i would just be able to r- really plan [mn] everything in advance you know when you're not working you have a million dollars [mn] uh and that kind of capital there you don't really have to invest time about 

582.18 595.36 B: y- you know uh getting ready to work and you don't even have to invest time really going to work and you can just sit down at a desk and really uh plan exactly wanting to do like like even a week ahead of time so i'd really sit down with a legal pad and a 

595.30 599.89 B: and a pen or paper and i would literally wr- you know write down like uh perha-
