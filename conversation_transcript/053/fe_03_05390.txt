6.18 8.65 B: hi how are you tonight 

8.98 10.13 A: good 

10.36 12.99 A: (( this this an interesting topic i guess [laughter] )) 

12.23 18.48 B: yeah i've uh i've done a couple of calls about this but uh this this is the first i never give this much of a thought 

18.77 22.97 A: how how many uh times you already done this this particular call thing 

22.39 24.10 B: uh this is the first one 

23.98 25.82 A: (( oh yeah this is my second one )) 

24.41 28.38 B: i've gotten several calls but they've never been at a convenient time 

27.68 30.49 A: yeah this is the second one actually for me yeah 

28.72 29.78 B: yeah 

29.91 31.29 B: yeah i'm on 

30.69 36.75 A: well i guess it'll it's a tough call if whether out i would do a perjury for my family members i don't know 

36.07 49.67 B: yeah i don't know it just i i i think it comes down to a a basic of of of of morals and what you know what you know the the personal doing right doing wrong maybe i don't know in my my opinion it might depend on 

37.03 37.59 A: (( [mn] )) 

49.73 51.34 B: what they did 

52.53 59.13 A: uh and plus also what what is the the situation around it around the the prosecution too you know 

55.97 57.60 B: yeah 

58.18 60.67 B: yeah yeah 

59.45 62.26 A: yes i mean uh it it'll be tough for uh 

62.50 64.62 A: for me not to do it you know 

64.15 69.73 B: yeah yeah i've i've been on a couple of juries but i i i never 

65.20 66.31 A: uh 

70.29 72.30 B: [mn] got the feeling that that 

72.86 78.00 B: that that was being done at the time just because of the type of jury that i was on 

78.38 82.65 A: okay well i've never been on a jury you know so i don't know but but i'm i'm not a citizen 

80.14 81.37 B: yeah 

82.35 83.71 B: yeah 

83.01 89.82 A: (( so so i can't go on a jury you know but i've i've i watch a l- lot of t._v. a lot of programs you know [mn] [mn] )) 

84.99 86.03 B: uh-huh 

87.84 98.47 B: yeah i don't know it seems it seems like that i i think in in on television it it kind of makes it melodramatic you know the with the with all the motions and everything going on but 

97.83 99.05 A: yeah 

98.47 103.69 B: but [mn] people tend and [mn] you i don't know when you get up there and you 

103.86 107.11 B: you've got to say your piece it's it's really different 

107.27 118.67 A: it's it's it's really tough you know you you may anything you want beforehand you know but when you are up there you know everybody else is watching and stuff to to make the call whether you would or you would not you [laughter] know 

112.01 113.14 B: yeah 

116.90 131.68 B: yeah i don't know i i i had a friend that was up there one time and uh it was very simple questions he was being asked and he just he he he completely lost his mind and it was a- it was about his uh about a friend of his that was uh 

131.62 132.53 B: in uh 

132.92 134.27 B: on trial 

134.18 135.18 A: okay 

134.77 147.39 B: and and it was very [mn] you know when you get up there and the the you know the the the the scrutiny of wanting to make the right tool and the right answer you know ri- answer the questions right you know that that 

145.69 159.04 A: yeah i mean [mn] fortunately i i really believe that you know let's say if let's say if my kid did something wrong you know uh i think he should pay for it you know this is but then some of the laws in this country are so 

152.55 153.68 B: mhm 

154.44 155.90 B: yeah 

159.22 161.84 A: i mean for example some of the drug uh 

161.87 163.31 B: yeah 

162.63 165.68 A: [mn] are so so way out of whack you know 

165.26 166.34 B: yeah 

165.71 168.69 A: that that you might have a tough time saying do i want to 

167.45 168.58 B: yeah 

168.77 173.47 A: uh for a for a simple thing somebody does you know he may go to jail for ten years you know 

172.78 174.15 B: yeah 

173.53 175.82 A: and you know the law's wrong you know 

175.04 176.88 B: yeah 

176.04 181.43 A: but uh so it at that time that i might [laughter] i might do it i don't know you know 

178.59 179.66 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

180.37 192.14 B: you you you might yeah you may or may not but yeah i i think that but but i think in you know in in this country the way the way things are i i can't say that i i'm familiar with the laws of other countries 

182.82 183.71 A: yeah 

191.72 192.70 A: yeah 

192.46 197.71 B: you know but in this country i [mn] i really think that it w- it would depend on 

198.11 209.00 B: you know the the situation like you said or what it would really come down to but you know it would be ve- it would be very but like you said it would be very hard not to do the right thing too 

200.60 201.46 A: yeah 

202.12 203.81 A: uh-huh same here yeah 

209.32 221.82 A: yeah because you know i i always believed that you know if if somebody made a mistake and you know or or somebody did a crime you know they gotta pay for it you know or they might whether it was my own family or not you know because if you let 'em get away today they'll do it again tomorrow 

214.36 217.26 B: [mn] yeah yeah 

221.34 229.72 B: mhm yeah uh you know i never i i never thought of it that way but yeah that yeah may- you know that you know that 

223.17 224.45 A: (( you know that's all it )) 

226.08 227.25 A: yeah 

228.50 241.27 A: because i had friends you know who have kids who sort of misbehave so much you know and then they and they keep supporting them you know and i tell 'em i say let them go you know let them pay the price because then they will learn from the experience you know 

232.50 233.59 B: yeah 

236.94 238.14 B: yeah 

240.83 242.18 B: yeah 

241.47 243.16 A: but if you always uh 

243.59 245.32 A: making them up uh 

244.82 246.29 B: mhm 

245.71 250.00 A: then they gonna keep doing it you know 'cause that i mean how are they gonna change otherwise you know 

246.94 248.08 B: yeah 

249.28 250.89 B: yeah exactly 

250.28 263.17 A: so but but like i said you know there are certain uh laws you know especially dealing with uh minor drug crimes you know are so out of whack that i will really feel uncomfortable supporting the government for that you know [cough] 

257.41 258.49 B: yeah 

261.92 267.90 B: yeah would yeah i i think that that's where i i think you know i i think where it comes down to 

267.70 278.19 B: when it's a life death situations or or things like that but yeah mi- minor drugs uh maybe the you know the you know maybe that that it it maybe 

278.64 280.80 B: come down to something like that 

280.19 281.48 A: that's true yeah 

280.83 285.41 B: you know but i i hope that it would never would come down to something like that but 

284.71 293.18 A: yeah but you know i mean they also depend upon people's culture too you see like in my you know we are very close to the family you know 

285.86 286.95 B: you know that 

289.85 290.87 B: yeah 

292.34 293.93 B: yeah 

293.15 301.14 A: and uh you would you would feel half pressed uh you know you you you like for example let's say the italians you know they have the big uh 

299.67 300.88 B: mhm 

301.27 304.75 A: uh father figure in in in in in the clan you know 

304.25 305.72 B: mhm 

305.09 309.06 A: he's gonna put pressure on you not to give up your real family you know 

308.47 309.85 B: yeah 

309.24 313.15 A: that kind of thing you know so it it's yeah like i say it's it's a tough call 

313.21 315.35 A: (( it's easy to theorize about it )) 

315.20 316.52 B: mhm 

315.84 319.14 A: (( but until it happens to you i really can't really you know )) 

317.64 331.90 B: but [mn] think though too like you said though [mn] culture how you've been brought up what what what's going on there just so many thi- little things that that can play a part into into that but again you know doing doing the right thing 

322.48 323.92 A: yeah exactly 

331.76 333.54 A: yeah same here exactly 

331.92 341.06 B: that's that's one thing you want to get up there do the right thing 'cause you would hope that if it ever came down to you that [mn] you you know that it would it would be the same way 

337.45 338.34 A: (( uh-huh )) 

341.29 351.70 B: you know that it wouldn't something wrong like you said uh a a minor drug o- offense or something you know a traffic ticket or a seri- you know something like that where it came down to something like that 

341.30 342.22 A: yeah 

349.65 353.86 A: yeah the the some of those things you know you gotta let them pay the price and get done with it you know 

352.63 363.12 B: yeah yeah i never thought i i never never though culture would play that part in it but you know the the the having said that i i would i would have to agree 

354.01 357.23 A: (( yeah you know or i )) 

362.95 371.42 A: well it definitely plays a big in big big uh role in you know with our cultures we are very close to each other family wise you know 

367.37 368.37 B: yeah 

370.64 371.96 B: yeah 

371.53 373.87 A: and you have uh 

374.19 377.93 A: you know like like the overall father figure you know 

377.44 378.88 B: mhm 

378.33 382.40 A: and in in in my culture you know i mean it's not when when you do something wrong 

382.59 386.69 A: they don't think that it's you who did it but it's so and so's son did it you [laughter] know 

385.85 387.77 B: yeah 

386.73 392.95 A: that's how it is looked upon you know so you have to also worry about what your parents going are going through you know 

388.47 389.49 B: yeah 

390.11 391.33 B: yeah that's 

392.54 399.26 B: yeah that that definitely would that definitely puts a whole different light on that type of subject i i never 

394.27 394.83 A: (( [cough] )) 

398.41 408.37 A: that's right yeah but like i said you know going back to how you know how ninety nine percent i probably would not commit perjury you know because you also have to worry about yourself too 

399.38 401.11 B: you know that that really does 

405.88 406.84 B: mhm 

407.82 409.69 B: yeah exactly 

408.68 411.61 A: (( or you could be you could be responsible and then )) 

411.63 413.90 A: if the if the law found out 

411.70 412.76 B: (( but i i think )) 

412.89 414.95 B: (( [mn] exactly )) 

414.56 419.47 A: then you could uh be punished uh you know even even worse than the other guy you know 

416.46 417.42 B: yeah 

419.19 426.19 B: sometimes too though it depends on how how it's presented to you how a lawyer asks a question if you if if 

425.19 428.41 A: (( that's true yeah that's a good point too yeah exactly you know )) 

426.74 434.89 B: you know if if they that they say did you see the person or was the person with you or you know it depen- you know for for example 

432.12 433.17 A: yeah 

434.93 444.92 A: yeah a lot of times you know and and ans- answer like i don't know i didn't see could be could be easily done you know because uh uh 

435.01 436.27 B: you know or 

439.31 440.41 B: yeah 

440.99 441.79 B: yeah 

442.45 443.90 B: yeah exactly 

444.99 445.86 B: you know 

445.05 448.80 A: (( like for example i don't know did you hear about the [noise] the case uh )) 

449.01 452.59 A: in massachussetts where uh one of the 

452.97 454.44 A: (( [noise] brother is )) 

454.85 459.38 A: (( uh uh in your city president of university of massachussetts and the other brother is a murderer [noise] )) 

459.01 460.34 B: yeah 

459.87 462.87 A: and he's just losing his job now because he would not uh 

463.00 465.97 A: (( uh do any [noise] what do you call uh )) 

466.03 467.76 A: (( be a witness against his brother )) 

467.37 468.70 B: yeah 

468.09 470.40 A: so now he might lose his job now you know 

469.71 470.90 B: yeah 

470.66 476.05 A: because the government is saying that you know you know you can't be holding a responsible position like he he the president 

475.47 479.04 B: yeah you didn't yeah exactly and they and they 

477.63 478.89 A: (( yeah so so )) 

479.27 487.05 B: yeah that's that's yeah yeah i i just don't i i i've never [laughter] i've never really 

480.14 481.47 A: tough call you 

482.22 482.99 A: (( know )) 

487.06 491.07 B: been presented with a question as as such you know would would you or would you not and 

490.52 491.44 A: yeah 

490.92 505.21 B: you know or or had a an indepth or or a lengthy conversation about it but you know it it you know when you're talking to a stranger i think that you know i i think that you could be a little more honest or something like that i i feel but you know i 

495.67 496.99 A: (( mhm )) 

502.91 504.45 A: that's true yeah 

505.23 512.42 B: you would you know i would [mn] i i wouldn't want to put anybody in that position in the first place but like you said most you know 

512.68 520.33 B: it it would come down to probably [mn] probably not i i [mn] in all likelihood not 

516.21 517.21 A: yeah 

520.11 524.71 A: that's right yeah as i say i feel the same way yeah you know yeah 

524.72 525.45 B: (( [mn] but )) 

524.82 529.37 A: (( so i mean [mn] do do do you what is the particular research is it do you think's )) 

529.55 531.56 A: up and up and all that i don't [laughter] 

531.10 532.73 B: (( i'm sorry i don't )) 

532.12 534.21 A: know uh about the research itself 

534.07 547.41 B: know i think that uh with some of the questions that that are presented themselves i i think that um you know they're th- th- they they can or can't be loaded questions like this i mean it there there's no there's there's a lot of grey area 

543.16 544.09 A: yeah 

547.36 548.21 A: yeah 

547.57 554.02 B: and and with something like that and and like you said this is gonna be a a you know political powder keg so to speak 

553.95 556.16 B: you know that someone perjured and someone 

554.20 555.02 A: yeah 

556.09 563.59 B: not told not disclosed that someone lied did so- did someone say one thing and and and not really mean it was it you know 

563.51 575.46 B: was some- was somebody found innocent because of something was someone found guilty because of it you know or you know something like that you know so i yeah no i just don't what now what what 

567.85 569.12 A: that's right yeah 

570.48 573.69 A: yeah it is is a tough call you know yeah 

575.50 576.94 B: [mn] but you know i 

577.13 580.77 B: you know some of the some of the uh uh my culture 

580.89 585.19 B: you know my my my my my primary culture you just don't 

583.90 584.86 A: yeah 

585.22 590.84 B: and i don't know the it just it would it would type of extended family you you don't see that a lot in today's 

590.95 598.20 B: uh american society it it it's it's not as prevalent uh uh because of that so 

591.14 592.62 A: that's right yeah 

598.40 599.95 B: you know i i don't know if it would ev-
