32.71 35.52 B: (( [noise] )) 

35.20 40.89 A: there's o- other than completely converting the society uh there's really nothing you can do about it so

71.53 73.99 B: yes yes i agree 

72.20 73.54 A: um 

73.49 86.05 A: and so a- and wouldn't necessarily be so simple to pull off so i i suppose i'm thinking that eventually something will happen certainly somewhere but it's not such a simple thing 

85.89 97.78 A: and i i'm not it's not the sort of thing that keeps me up at night because i mean you know you could go driving in your car and get killed there's far more people that's going to happen that's going to happen to
