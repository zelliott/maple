11.79 12.79 B: i see 

13.53 15.87 A: (( uh bio terrorism [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

15.88 17.45 A: our topic of the day 

17.65 20.97 A: i don't particularly see any way for us to prevent it 

21.23 24.33 A: uh in my opinion i don't think there's any way to 

24.66 29.66 A: keep the possibility of a hundred percent success 

31.89 40.08 A: with i- in in any [noise] in any way much less in the culture we have which allows a lot of freedom so i don't see it i don't see any way to do so 

40.18 41.32 A: any thoughts 

41.56 44.98 B: uh yah [noise] uh yeah i understand what you're saying um i think um 

45.61 55.29 B: well i think uh they're doing everything that they can with uh our president and the government but anyway maybe we should be more alert in 

55.67 61.49 B: ourselves we should be more alert ourselves and you know like if we see anything we should report it 

61.91 70.50 B: i think er now think we can't we can't be like a hundred percent uh positive about like if there's attack or 

70.91 78.37 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well what kind of things would you w- see that you would report that would make you think it was something related to bio terrorism 

77.05 79.03 B: (( anything um )) 

80.54 83.14 B: i'm not sure like anything suspicious 

84.69 85.85 B: (( or uh obviously )) 

89.33 95.20 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well for example if you saw somebody from maybe who had uh was of arabic e- 

95.52 99.30 A: an arabic ethnicity driving a truck 

100.03 103.11 A: [lipsmack] and you weren't sure what it was would you report that 

102.72 103.94 B: well 

104.08 108.57 B: if he acted suspicious or anything yeah i'd like um 

109.59 110.95 B: (( like uh-huh )) 

110.96 124.75 B: like i go to college and everything yeah and you're just like you you're all mixed in so can't really can't really report it on just on how they look or anything so it's kind of like what they do or something 

112.70 114.11 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

121.85 122.98 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

125.30 127.80 A: well i have i'm wondering 

128.23 139.22 A: uh what well i think there's obviously a lot of potential for abuse for that or unintentional or intentional uh because somebody could be say in a bad mood [laughter] and driving a truck and that could seem suspicious 

133.11 134.88 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

139.23 145.05 A: and then they get reported and hauled in front of the cops and called in for well i guess it'd be the f. f._b._i. 

144.19 155.70 B: yeah like right after el niner huh oh go ahead oh yeah r- right after nine eleven there were like uh students like a lady reported them people there in the city 

145.25 146.19 A: (( really wh- ))

178.37 189.15 B: yeah but wh- why i don't think we can really put like any more money into it in we're putting all this money into it and it does help but to the point like where 

189.67 191.26 B: (( there has to be like both )) 

192.17 196.86 B: (( both um we have to deal with and like money ))

199.43 200.52 B: (( uh )) 

201.11 207.41 B: like our armed forces and everything our computer systems i guess 

207.92 211.29 A: [noise] what would the money for the armed forces do to h- stop bio terrorism 

213.26 216.46 B: (( uh i was thinking about just terrorism in general ))

240.84 243.83 B: (( yeah [noise] yeah )) 

241.33 245.31 A: things like that they they commissioned a whole bunch 

245.42 251.27 A: of production of vaccine and i don't think they've i think they just blew that money down the toilet because i don't see [lipsmack] 

251.96 266.21 A: i haven't heard of one case of small pox or any bio terrorism attacks in this country so far i mean the only thing we've had so far is nine eleven is that a year ago a year and half ago i guess jeeze and is it a year and half ago already

449.12 456.48 A: [lipsmack] i don't see i honestly don't think we can do much about bio terrorism it's too easy i've i don't know if you ever read tom clancy 

456.36 457.61 B: (( yeah yeah actually )) 

456.51 464.08 A: one of his novels do you remember the novel he has uh which one was it uh [lipsmack] the

474.54 476.66 B: (( i i know what you're talking about yeah )) 

475.69 483.02 A: a- and they told it er that i mean it was a perfectly fictionalized example of how easy it would be to do something like that 

482.73 484.56 B: uh-huh that's right 

484.44 496.95 A: and [noise] and they and then again how difficult it would be for it to spread but [noise] it still was something that should've been made clear to people that you really can't stop it i mean there's no way even if we had all kinds of draconian measures 

496.92 501.43 A: controlling our society it wouldn't happen it's too easy it's too small it's too easy to carry 

501.58 505.48 A: if somebody wanted if they're gonna blow themselves up they can infect themselves 

505.57 512.80 A: er knowing they're gonna die and then just walk into some public place and pass along the whatever and you get fifty people to do that and there we go 

512.73 515.55 B: (( [noise] yeah that's true that's right uh )) 

512.81 514.37 A: maybe a massive outbreak [noise] 

516.77 526.85 A: i don't know i just don't think i think it's just something we have to live with much like potential for dir- dirty bombs and some maniac in a high school just pulling a gun and starting to shoot people
