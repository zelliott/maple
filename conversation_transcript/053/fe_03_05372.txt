297.43 308.46 A: but um no five fifteen an hour is poultry five fifteen an hour is is abysmal five fifteen an hour is going to force people to do things that they don't really want to do um 

307.41 315.56 B: right i i i'm i'm sorry what what part um i i've looked you know i've seen what jobs are i don't think that i could find a job paying five fifteen an hour

321.00 323.44 A: probably like seven or eight up there or nine

349.02 358.16 A: it a a a mexican immigrant man you know who you know i mean c- would have a hard time making [laughter] it on four what four seventy five or five fifteen an hour 

358.19 372.59 A: you know what i mean and then when people get up and then when people start doing you know when they start slinging drugs or when they start doing other things you know when they start getting involved in illegitimate ah means of of of garnering money you know th- then then s- 

372.45 376.73 A: and and the people who are making the real money off the drugs are the are the corporations 

376.92 384.61 A: you know i mean the guys standing out on the corner they're not making any money but these big but these big corporations like i._b._m. and some of these other companies 

384.44 399.38 A: they're they're laundering they're laundering big drug money if america really wanted to crack down on the drug trafficking or if america wanted to crack down on the drugs that enter this country from abroad they can do a much better job than they are but drugs are a big money maker so they're not going to do that 

393.87 394.77 B: yeah 

395.80 396.49 B: to 

398.55 402.86 B: so so do you know what the what the federal poverty line is in this in the country 

402.64 408.71 A: i don't know what it is because i know like the further south you go the less money people make 

408.47 412.27 B: 'cause i i just took a look you know i put in all right let's say someone's gotten 

411.42 417.35 A: probably around nine ten thousand probably somewhere between seven and ten thousand annually i would think 

415.34 425.42 B: it yeah 'cause i i you know if you if you work forty hours a week at five fifteen an hour fifty two weeks a year you'd be making a little over ten thousand dollars in a year 

424.57 431.10 A: that's crazy man how in the hell [laughter] ten thousand dollars in a year come on man you 

425.89 426.89 B: yeah how 

429.12 430.15 B: yeah 

430.51 431.97 B: i mean who can 

431.49 435.69 A: and and then the money that they take away from you it seems like taxes are getting 

435.37 436.76 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

435.72 443.88 A: ah more larger and larger i mean more they're they're i'm losing more and more money to and and the fed i mean every [sigh] 

443.82 449.14 B: well i i heard um you know the what's what's happening with taxes 

444.51 445.94 A: (( it's just crazy )) 

449.22 454.03 B: ah you've got the bush um you know bush senior bush junior 

453.71 454.65 A: yeah 

454.07 465.71 B: republicans back through reagan who what they do is they say all right let's have some tax cuts let's let's take the ground out from underneath the government if there's no money there then one of these days 

466.24 472.09 B: government is going to be forced to be smaller because there's just not the money for it and that's i think what the real you know 

469.53 470.34 A: yeah 

471.50 476.89 A: and then they can take over they can they can get even more of a they can get even more of a foothold 

476.34 488.60 B: yeah but that's that's the um i think that's the the bigger plan behind these tax cuts i mean sure it's nice you're you're giving all this money back to back to the the wealthy but e- even 

488.14 492.11 A: it's nice for who we're not wealthy y- you're saying you're not wealthy 

490.45 498.52 B: oh oh- oh no i'm i'm i'm j- [laughter] i'm i'm i'm talking about the um the people who are benefiting from these tax cuts

498.30 499.24 A: yeah 

498.62 509.57 B: you know they're happy but it's not just to make those people happy i think it it's part of this deeper plan this this this master plan to to make the government smaller 

499.70 500.96 A: (( yes they're )) 

504.37 506.16 A: (( it's part of a plan yeah ))
