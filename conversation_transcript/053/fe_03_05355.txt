5.67 7.28 A: okay that's an odd name 

6.77 12.61 B: [laughter] yeah it's uh apparently fairly common in europe but uh doesn't make it over here very often 

11.15 11.97 A: mhm 

12.51 13.62 A: (( yes ah )) 

13.32 15.62 B: yeah so 

15.89 19.17 B: hmm topic of best in a life partner 

18.90 22.58 A: what what's most important it's not even like the best um 

20.14 20.91 B: yeah 

21.15 23.42 B: sure sure most important 

23.35 32.30 A: i i have a friend who uh says [noise] that uh the thing that makes for a good relationship is uh s- can be summed up in the 

32.40 35.29 A: letters pass p. a. s. s. 

34.77 36.04 B: mhm 

35.43 38.43 A: present available spacious and safe 

38.12 43.82 B: [laughter] that's interesting i'm sure there's uh some elaboration behind that 

43.46 44.89 A: yeah well you 

45.00 47.89 A: you want someone who's present someone who is actually paying attention 

47.36 48.27 B: sure 

48.09 52.53 A: right and who is really being you know 

48.63 49.67 B: that makes sense 

52.59 54.49 A: you know part of the conversation 

54.08 55.79 B: mhm 

54.70 59.76 A: um available that means that they are willing to show themselves to you yeah 

58.74 61.44 B: sure sure emotionally available and so forth 

60.94 65.17 A: yeah yeah but emotionally available and they got time for you if you need 'em 

61.67 62.53 B: mhm 

64.46 67.77 B: yeah that makes sense yeah absolutely 

66.84 71.73 A: yeah and um spacious they give you room to be yourself 

71.60 74.02 B: mhm mhm 

72.87 82.46 A: you know um there are a great many people out there that i've run into and i've been in relationships with some of them whose way of being is so 

78.59 79.45 B: mhm 

83.06 84.05 A: set 

84.35 86.72 A: that there's no room for me 

85.77 90.98 B: sure sure yeah not so they're not open for whatever reason sure understood 

90.24 98.53 A: mhm yeah and safe if uh they don't feel safe to be around it may be a very thrilling relationship but it's not one that's gonna laugh 

98.09 105.37 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah a joy ride is fine but you don't wanna live there yeah absolutely yeah no i think those are all very uh 

102.12 103.46 A: yeah yeah 

105.49 108.52 B: uh very important fundamentals 

108.46 114.46 B: uh for that sort of thing um i have a a a few specifics that i throw in as well 

110.17 111.84 A: mhm 

114.36 128.44 B: um one of those is uh compatible problem solving skills so there's gonna be problems and you'd better be able to talk about it and uh come to some resolution that's comfortable for both of you 

119.92 122.15 A: aha [laughter] 

122.29 123.90 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

124.77 126.35 A: (( ya ya )) 

128.47 129.27 A: (( ya )) 

128.84 135.23 B: in some ways i think that's more important than y- you know having a some limitation on the amount of problems you have 

135.40 139.78 A: [laughter] it's true it's true and i notice very clearly that you don't say 

140.07 143.67 A: the same problem solving skills but compatible ones 

141.74 148.03 B: exactly compatible exactly sometimes [mn] the same is is specifically not compatible [laughter] 

146.60 147.77 A: exactly 

148.14 160.94 B: so yeah and uh well and of course you know there are the the usual um you know must have uh some kind of shared interest in terms of what you actually spend time doing on a daily basis 

160.74 162.06 A: mhm 

161.20 162.94 B: (( you know and uh )) 

162.95 171.25 B: and then of course um i guess that's more of a compatibility issue compatible activities that one is that one are interested in 

169.93 172.55 A: mhm yeah 

172.55 173.97 B: yeah so 

174.30 175.60 B: yeah i um 

176.18 178.13 B: i have one of the uh 

178.29 182.68 B: uh uh you know this is a conversation we'll probably never chat again but uh so 

182.12 183.63 A: almost undoubtedly 

183.04 184.23 B: yeah exactly 

184.03 186.89 A: unless you wander into the other change of hobbit in berkeley [sigh] [mn] 

186.42 192.39 B: [laughter] yes right now i i happen to have an old uh berkeley uh email account but aside from that no 

192.43 192.99 A: (( [mn] )) 

192.46 195.56 B: um but uh 

196.51 206.82 B: [sigh] uh i i happen to be in you know the the tiny fraction of a percent of of uh uh you know intelligence test takers 

206.16 208.24 A: mhm 

206.77 220.76 B: um you know obviously that's you know only a it's one aspect of looking at intelligence but uh you know it tends to tends to dictate the kinds of things that i'm interested in and the the level of discussion that i'm interested in having and so forth so 

211.99 212.89 A: yeah 

217.07 217.95 A: mhm 

221.13 226.67 B: you know there's sort of a a general compatibility in terms of uh both 

224.33 227.97 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] hang on )) 

226.92 229.58 B: intellectual and emotional intelligence sure 

228.92 231.68 A: hang on just a second i need to catch this other call [noise] 

230.72 232.23 B: no problem 

231.84 233.73 A: other change of hobbit john whitmore 

239.11 240.10 B: and i'll just 

239.16 242.13 A: no all we carry is science fiction and fantasy sorry 

241.91 242.97 B: [laughter] 

243.32 245.38 A: sorry about that 

244.12 246.61 B: no problem so you're a specialty store there 

246.46 247.76 A: (( yeah )) 

246.96 250.66 B: that's cool very good i'd i'd certainly visit your store if i was local 

248.05 248.84 A: yeah 

250.68 252.76 A: twenty six years in business 

252.32 254.18 B: excellent excellent 

253.80 255.18 A: (( yeah )) 

254.38 255.51 B: fabulous 

256.32 258.15 B: yeah so anyway so 

256.90 260.44 A: anyway you were saying intelligence test taking and that uh 

260.47 262.23 A: guiding you in certain ways 

261.78 264.13 B: well yeah yeah i mean you know it's a 

264.32 267.21 B: a in in in short um 

267.28 280.87 B: you know it i i i have had a couple of relationships with people that were otherwise pretty compatible but you know they they weren't interested in you know [mn] casually chatting about uh latest in quantum physics and genetics a- and or 

279.89 281.64 A: mhm 

280.79 291.81 B: um the uh the the the cultural differences between uh you know eskimos and uh uh you know uh whatever arbitrary other culture et cetera so [sigh] 

291.16 302.67 A: yeah yeah so it's a you know th- there are people who if th- if they heard the opening line of a joke was um werner heisenberg kurt godel and noam chomsky walk into a bar they wouldn't start laughing immediately 

301.36 307.53 B: [laughter] oh dear yes exactly [laughter] [laughter] 

305.88 307.18 A: right 

308.47 312.20 B: ah sigh yes indeed um 

310.45 311.26 A: yes 

312.00 313.96 A: i could tell you the rest of the joke but 

313.81 322.87 B: [laughter] i'm not sure that's too on topic and i'm not sure that they care honestly i i my impression of this study is that they pretty much just want you to keep talking so 

320.93 325.32 A: [laughter] exactly that's that's sort of my impression too 

323.80 330.45 B: yeah so in that in that case tell me the joke we don't have much time left i'd imagine [laughter] [laughter] 

327.12 336.34 A: right okay um so heisenberg looks around and says because there are three of us and because this is a bar it must be a joke but the question is is it funny or not 

336.18 337.19 B: (( oh dear )) 

336.41 346.78 A: and godel thinks for a moment and says well because we're inside the joke we can't tell whether it's funny we'd have to be outside looking at it and chomsky looks at both of them and says of course it's funny you're just telling it wrong 

341.34 343.44 B: [laughter] 

346.84 348.67 B: oh 

349.00 350.56 B: oh 

350.68 355.76 B: (( [laughter] )) 

356.43 357.59 B: [sigh] ooh 

358.01 362.03 B: a joke that is simultaneously f- funny and scathing [laughter] 

361.34 366.03 A: yes [laughter] and and way too erudite [laughter] 

364.16 367.51 B: yes yes [laughter] quite i'll have to remember that 

366.88 370.80 A: john m. ford of minneapolis came up with it if you want to give proper credit 

370.23 373.32 B: john m. ford minneapolis excellent 

372.45 373.23 A: (( yes )) 

373.36 375.21 A: yes that's a 

373.43 375.40 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

375.97 378.00 B: that's good i like that 

377.52 385.31 A: it's my current favorite joke which is of course one of the things they're not going to ask here but is of course related to [mn] whether one ah 

385.38 389.18 A: would do well with a life p- partner or not whether they like your jokes 

389.29 394.11 B: [laughter] oh yeah that's certainly yeah compatible compatible um 

394.13 405.85 B: one of the things about compatible uh you know activity uh you know how you spend what your one's time is you know whether you not you have a sense of humour and whether or not it's compatible as well [laughter] 

398.37 399.38 A: mhm 

400.22 401.11 A: mhm 

404.71 407.28 A: yeah yeah well 

406.01 414.22 B: and some people seem to even go so far as to say compatible in the desire to have conversations at all [laughter] 

412.75 416.93 A: that's certainly true yeah and again that's a [sigh] 

416.97 421.92 A: the desire to have conversations is part of that availability thing i was talking about 

419.96 423.75 B: [mn] oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah 

422.10 423.90 A: you know we don't uh 

424.04 429.97 A: if you're not actually available it becomes very difficult to really get anywhere 

425.91 427.42 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

429.65 432.54 B: well um mm go ahead [laughter] 

430.01 432.36 A: actually mm after you 

433.11 438.40 A: i was gonna say someone who wants somebody's who is willing to grow at the same time 

437.63 448.02 B: yes yes i that is that is in fact very important um yeah i [laughter] or or growing in some congruent and or compatible way because uh 

447.39 448.94 A: yeah 

447.87 460.16 B: you know certainly there are people out there that do not particularly grow and you know perhaps if they find another person who is not particularly growing then uh and they're con- compatible that's great um but yeah most people of of 

451.10 451.94 A: mhm 

454.76 455.65 A: mhm 

457.65 458.65 A: mhm 

460.14 467.19 B: um of any serious interest from at least my perspective um are are going to be growing and changing and uh 

467.34 478.18 B: you know [laughter] you probably wanna be at either a similar stage or or a stage where you can be um um patient and involved um with their growth in one fashion or another 

475.82 476.77 A: (( yeah )) 

478.01 482.29 A: yeah yeah and sometimes people for no good you know for no 

482.79 485.50 A: reason end up growing in different directions 

484.97 495.51 B: sure absolutely in fact that's uh that sums up my romantic life at the moment actually [laughter] ironically so i have some hope that uh that my 

486.98 487.86 A: you know 

491.11 492.19 A: (( yeah )) 

492.56 493.98 A: yes yes 

495.63 499.66 B: uh my current long term partner will uh 

499.84 507.66 B: uh in fact grow in a direction that uh that will lead lead her back to me but uh they never may or may not happen of course so 

507.68 513.84 A: yes now i'm going through something very similar myself so [laughter] part of why i'm thinking about it 

510.17 511.86 B: [laughter] 

512.46 515.64 B: yes it's a very very human condition i think so 

515.23 519.81 A: yeah now after seven years or so it's a 

515.85 517.29 B: [laughter] 

519.49 525.56 B: oh yeah yeah no this is this is only after about a year and a quarter so 

520.33 521.61 A: yeah 

525.18 526.04 A: (( mm )) 

525.49 535.11 B: you know no serious commitments have been made at this point aside from you know expression of of wanting to make serious commitments at some point so 

534.13 536.90 A: mhm yeah yeah 

535.42 536.26 B: (( you know )) 

536.85 541.23 B: so we'll we'll just you know it's one of those things one one will see how it goes 

540.93 541.89 A: yes
