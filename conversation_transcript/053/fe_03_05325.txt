146.81 147.70 A: mm 

146.94 156.07 B: um but also uh recently tickets are hard to come by so there was a recent game with the yankees and the cubs and it was 

147.93 148.92 A: yeah 

156.14 164.11 B: impossible to get tickets and off uh you know off site tickets were selling for like five hundred dollars or something so it was not

250.26 251.08 A: uh 

253.02 255.12 B: i don't know i think it's 

255.03 260.62 B: it's or like i said it's almost a cult for some people you know and um

313.60 318.22 A: uh yeah yeah it's it's [laughter] yeah it's it's kind of 

318.61 321.68 A: i guess so yeah what are they researching what are 

321.69 323.71 B: i think it's linguistics 

323.46 324.42 A: linguistics 

323.76 330.69 B: so i think they're just i don't know i'm assuming from what i read that with the and the information that they're 

331.37 337.94 B: that they want to provide a context that they're just listening to people's accents and inflection and 

337.32 338.27 A: [laughter] 

338.35 342.23 B: i don't know maybe also the way that people interact with one another so 

341.99 343.34 A: yeah 

343.31 344.87 B: (( i don't know [noise] )) 

344.91 353.97 B: but uh [laughter] it is it well i'll i'll be interested to see if i get paid that's really the interesting thing [laughter] so
