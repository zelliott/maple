23.22 32.89 B: uh-huh i i i don't have any at all like my parents don't want me or well they don't want to have any pets at all 'cause like my mom's got a garden 

23.84 24.82 A: blue heeler 

33.05 42.29 B: and so she ha- hates like having cats and dogs like tear the garden up so she doesn't want any at all 

33.49 34.10 A: (( uh )) 

42.40 43.92 A: (( that's understandable )) 

43.41 50.84 B: yeah yeah but we used to have a lot of cats though 'cause uh we'd get so many strays that would come up here 

50.70 51.67 A: right 

51.07 58.09 B: like we live out in the country so people just like instead of taking the cat to like an animal shelter they just they'll drop it off at your house 

57.83 59.67 A: right [laughter] 

58.63 59.87 B: and uh 

59.92 63.32 B: so and and they just multiply though 

63.49 68.65 B: if you don't get 'em fixed so that was another reason they don't want like any pets at all either 

69.14 71.92 B: so but uh 

72.47 76.08 B: how important is your pet to you 

76.51 83.24 A: uh my cat is not real important [laughter] however the dog is pretty she's awesome 

79.89 80.79 B: uh-huh 

82.67 84.78 B: uh-huh what kind of dog is it 

84.08 85.30 A: (( it's a blue heeler )) 

85.25 86.44 B: oh really 

85.84 87.66 A: yeah she's a puppy she's uh 

87.97 89.69 A: she's five months old 

89.09 93.22 B: uh-huh did you i- did you have to like um how did you get her 

93.37 98.95 A: um we actually got her through a breeder like a guy that lives like twenty or thirty miles away 

95.12 96.06 B: uh-huh 

98.70 100.86 B: (( and how much did that c- how much did it run you )) 

100.63 102.34 A: she was fifty 

101.75 105.52 B: uh-huh hm yeah 

102.73 104.46 A: so [laughter] yeah 

104.80 106.40 A: but i mean 

106.73 114.25 A: you can spend five hundred bucks on a dog that's going to be an idiot you know uh inbred stupid dog crooked teeth 

114.17 115.19 B: yeah 

114.57 119.20 A: or you can go for a blue heeler which is go- she's going to be eh smart and you know 

119.18 120.78 B: yeah they uh 

119.63 120.47 A: (( obedient )) 

120.92 125.15 B: they typically do like really well in like obedience competitions 

124.56 125.91 A: yeah yeah it 

125.43 126.84 B: (( and i was kind of like )) 

126.89 137.33 B: there was like um i went to like our local animal shelter and they had one that was kind of like a mix but it was a really well behaved dog and it was really really smart but um 

136.92 140.46 A: was probably a blue heeler uh border collie mix 

140.24 143.78 B: i think that's what it was actually um but it was uh 

144.08 154.50 B: still had a lot of puppy in it so like when i went to go like the actual day i went in to go adopt the dog it had contracted um parvo 

146.03 147.03 A: right 

154.46 155.30 A: uh-huh 

154.87 158.22 B: and so they had to put it to sleep basically so it was like argh 

156.61 157.53 A: oh man 

158.99 160.35 A: that's not good 

159.73 167.80 B: yeah and then th- there was like a a yellow lab that i was looking at there as well that also contracted parvo as well so 

167.98 169.18 A: gee it 

168.06 172.55 B: i i guess i just had bad luck following me every time i went in there 

169.83 170.90 A: was parvo 

173.32 174.40 B: (( so um )) 

174.42 180.73 B: but are you going to like train the dog and do obedience trials with it or anything like that or just 

177.16 178.27 A: oh just 

179.76 182.93 A: obedience we're not going to do obedience school i mean just uh 

183.29 186.77 A: you know just work with her at home and stuff i mean 

186.71 187.56 B: uh-huh 

187.07 189.43 A: i- she learns really really quickly so 

189.45 190.57 B: yeah 

189.90 194.70 A: and she's already obedient as it is which is really like surprising for uh 

194.88 196.33 A: (( a puppy you know )) 

196.13 197.39 B: yeah 

196.78 198.42 A: and she's li- 

197.68 200.74 B: well like a r- a real reputable breeder will uh 

201.14 207.32 B: will t- will train the puppy so that as soon as you get it it it responds to 

207.48 212.39 B: training really well or at least it'll know how to like sit and stay 

208.82 209.62 A: right 

212.84 215.63 B: and hopefully not go to the bathroom in the house but 

215.00 221.05 A: right [laughter] well i don't think she w- i think we got her before he really had an- any time to work with her but 

220.62 221.51 B: uh-huh 

221.35 223.09 A: 'cause she was too young but 

222.76 225.51 B: mhm cool 

225.85 227.81 B: but uh i've we used to have w- 

227.97 230.19 B: we had used to have a german shepherd 

230.39 241.47 B: and that dog my dad had got it while he was ah he used to live in germany um and he brought the dog back but you had to give commands to it in german 

235.53 237.05 A: mhm 

241.76 245.84 B: that w- that you know that was all it understood but it was 

245.17 246.57 A: oh yeah yeah 

245.98 253.75 B: it was a really it was a pretty headstrong kind of dog and german shepherds are like they're like really protective 

253.53 254.50 A: right 

253.89 260.95 B: they're like like a lot more so than like other breeds really so like you couldn't like make any sudden movements at all 

260.48 261.65 A: (( [laughter] )) 

261.42 265.90 B: like towards like me or my family 'cause the dog would freak out 

265.57 268.26 A: was it like military or police trained 

267.67 270.72 B: yeah i think it was uh military trained 

270.07 271.04 A: cool 

271.11 273.83 B: but i i got a an uncle 

273.92 276.81 B: and he works with like canine 

277.04 281.10 B: and um h- the dog that he had um 

277.30 277.99 A: cool 

281.22 284.09 B: the dog was trained in the czech republic 

284.14 289.66 B: before he got it and he had to give commands in czech and and that dog was 

285.36 286.26 A: huh 

290.13 292.68 B: pretty psycho actually 

291.70 293.24 A: [laughter] 

293.30 299.79 B: so but i i didn't like i never pet the dog at all i was uh it scared the crap out of me 

300.17 305.04 B: 'cause it was you know a purebred german shepherd's a pretty big dog 

304.44 308.81 A: right right yeah and when they're trained like that you know you they're 

309.10 314.20 A: kind of unpredictable unless they're with their original trainers 

310.29 312.22 B: mhm 

313.50 315.99 B: yeah yeah 

316.11 323.26 B: so what about the cat is that just like general family pet you just keep around 

318.62 319.42 A: (( yeah sh- )) 

320.43 322.39 A: yeah um 

322.67 323.84 A: yeah she's 

323.88 331.11 A: she's kinda she kinda hangs out eats a lot sleeps a lot she's real fat [laughter] 

328.79 332.17 B: yeah yeah typical cat so 

331.76 334.98 A: but uh since we got the dog they've been like you know 

335.22 340.83 A: kind of playing together and the cat gets pissed off like at the dog though she like jumps out and swats at her and stuff 

340.55 341.48 B: uh-huh 

341.22 342.31 A: (( but i )) 

342.64 346.90 A: think she's losing some weight 'cause she runs around a lot more now [laughter] 

345.36 346.77 B: yeah yeah [laughter] 

346.79 350.11 B: but the dog like gets along with it r- well or 

350.48 351.88 A: well sort of 

351.30 356.27 B: uh or the cat doesn't get along well with the dog even though the dog's trying to make 

353.45 354.26 A: right 

355.65 361.65 A: well the dog thinks she's getting along with the cat but the cat doesn't well the cat thinks otherwise 

361.41 362.52 B: right 

361.87 363.38 A: [laughter] 

362.68 363.67 B: she uh

372.81 375.59 B: there are like a lot of cats like that out here 

376.30 378.01 B: i guess 'cause like 

376.30 378.90 A: 'cause her eyes are kind of narrow and 

378.87 380.17 B: yeah 

380.19 385.73 A: and she's kind of i don't know she's just kind of got a a hint of that wild 

385.77 387.79 A: cat feel to her 

387.19 388.11 B: uh-huh 

388.45 389.82 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

389.21 391.75 B: does she just stay outside like all the time 

391.16 397.36 A: actually she's an indoor cat she she gets kind of freaked out when she goes out outdoors [laughter] it's kind of funny 

393.02 393.91 B: uh-huh 

396.13 397.06 B: (( [laughter] ))

413.45 414.61 A: (( just close )) 

414.72 426.99 B: like we used to have like this one cat that was like really feral looking and it looked more like a bobcat than like an actual cat 'cause th- the whiskers that were on like his eyebrows were so long it was really weird looking 

424.57 425.79 A: (( right )) 

426.59 429.71 A: he must have been like full feral or all feral uh i 

429.13 431.17 B: yeah yeah pretty much [laughter] 

430.50 439.64 A: think our cat she's just partial she's part feral because not not a lot of the features are really uh prominent
