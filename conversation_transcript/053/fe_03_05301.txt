172.31 173.54 A: right 

176.57 183.16 B: i don't know it seems like it would be it's gonna be real expensive process and a real slow process to 

183.18 186.92 B: make sure every single person is not a terrorist [laughter] 

186.10 200.25 A: right but you know i can't blame them even with the airports you know we have to wait in line to check your with the ah with the metal detector and the but i mean for instance with the a- ah anthrax that we had ah during the after nine eleven

217.12 218.35 B: right 

222.83 223.75 B: right

231.00 232.48 A: know it's incredible 

232.41 241.20 B: i know and it's so sad i mean the thought of innocent lives being killed is just a real travesty and it's just terrible you know and 

240.23 241.38 A: i know 

241.49 243.13 A: (( you know it's just too )) 

241.56 245.03 B: so they have to do what they can to help make it so that 

244.00 253.86 A: ah you know it's just too bad that ah the whole world just can't get along i mean i- it's short as it is w- we're trying to take care of our oxygen our ah

253.11 253.92 B: (( know )) 

253.76 260.69 A: (( our our food and water and it is is sad that people gotta go through something like this just to get power ))

265.78 266.86 B: it's true 

266.58 269.71 A: (( i- it's like ah starting all over with adam and eve you )) 

269.43 270.92 B: right i know like 

269.91 273.12 A: know it just it just amazes me you know 

272.75 283.85 B: life is so short it seems that people wanna complicate it by making it so difficult and by violence and killing and it just it makes me feel like parts of the world have gone completely mad 

275.88 276.95 A: yeah 

279.45 280.42 A: yes 

283.20 297.14 A: yeah they're i i just don't understand and each d- each decade there's always something different you know it the the ah someone's always gotta have more power how much power does a country or person want i mean it's incredible 

288.24 289.38 B: mhm 

291.85 292.91 B: i know 

294.94 296.36 B: i don't know [sigh]

309.99 311.07 B: it's true 

311.03 315.02 A: too many people getting killed i mean it's incredible 

311.18 312.93 B: i know it's ridiculous 

314.00 318.58 B: completely ridiculous and and it's when they use bioterrorism as a way to 

318.37 319.63 A: yeah 

319.02 324.02 B: to manipulate or control other people or to hurt other people i think that's just awful because 

323.35 324.38 A: i know 

324.08 335.44 B: and so i mean in order to control it i mean i guess you just have to i think in order to control bioterrorism then this country's gonna have to invest in the high technology industry 

327.25 328.43 A: right 

334.31 348.52 A: i guess to track it because i know i know it's hard i mean they're trying to put ah something in our waters and stuff like that they've gotta have it very high tech i mean trying to trace something in the water it has to take a lotta g- ah time and concern 

336.45 337.63 B: (( to do )) 

340.31 341.54 B: right 

343.75 344.66 B: uh-huh 

348.12 349.78 B: right so like the 

348.83 352.40 A: but you know it's they have to do something quick but um 

351.38 362.61 B: they have to invest money in the research and the development of technologies which will and that'll be good for the economy 'cause then it more people will work you know i mean some people will be getting paid money to do this and to 

355.29 356.15 A: yes 

359.55 360.43 A: right 

361.87 363.38 A: (( yes i don't know what )) 

362.53 370.87 B: help find these solutions so it's not bad and i think as long as money's as long as money's going back into the e- i mean if the federal government 

364.38 365.19 A: yeah 

365.50 367.36 A: no it isn't really 

371.16 377.98 B: is spending money like that for a that type of investment it goes right back into the economy and it goes back to the citizens so 

376.16 377.16 A: right 

377.73 383.37 A: yeah and ah well like ah they're always going to they're always going to shoot a a missile or a ah 

383.24 394.56 A: a rocket up on mars now i don't know about you but i know why would i want to live up on mars why would i ah why would i care less it's nice to know we're s- on that planet 

389.27 390.20 B: right 

394.13 395.10 B: right 

394.45 407.05 A: but what what is that gonna do for us and all the people that were starving in the ah in the world i mean it's [sigh] where where are their heads you know these are really intelligent people and i don't know 

399.74 401.43 B: (( i know i know )) 

403.95 405.08 B: ridiculous 

406.90 408.14 B: it's ridiculous 

407.25 415.82 A: it seems that maybe you know but i guess we have to just take it one day at a time and just hope that everybody there starts realizing we need each other 

411.37 412.59 B: i know 

416.18 418.21 B: it's true it's true 

417.08 419.23 A: yeah it really is true 

418.98 420.30 B: yeah i know 

419.24 424.62 A: it's incredible so how's the the how's everything in l._a. pretty good 

420.57 421.61 B: i know 

424.04 428.57 B: well things are going good out here i mean there's no terrorism yet [laughter] so

427.79 431.64 A: yeah that's the same here it's kinda quiet here even though we had a few 

430.06 439.23 B: it's been quiet and i i don't i d- i feel ok- everybody here feels pretty safe for the most part i don't hear a lot i don't he- run into a lot of people who're really worried about it i think 

435.17 436.22 A: mhm 

438.51 443.40 A: no because you that's what they want you to do the you gotta continue on with your life 

442.99 444.00 B: yeah 

443.35 455.95 A: you can't just shut yourself and shut the door put bars onto it and and scare with duct tape and everything i can understand maybe that ah when the t- t- time comes but right now you've just got to continue on with life 

447.02 447.92 B: right 

449.74 450.60 B: right 

452.88 453.66 B: right 

455.05 456.26 B: that's true 

456.05 462.68 A: you have to go out if you gotta go business you gotta go on a plane you got to do ah the things you always do every day 

459.20 460.10 B: uh-huh 

462.37 463.68 B: right right 

462.71 465.85 A: (( you can't just stop life i mean you just can't do that )) 

464.09 468.00 B: no you can't you can't stop life for anything you're right you know and 

466.98 481.54 A: no it ah i have a son that lives in colorado and he's ah he likes it out there he just moved out there about two years ago and he's ah he's just concerned about stuff like that he he'll call up home and say hey dad what should i do between ah you know with all this ah you know

510.85 511.92 B: yeah 

513.03 518.32 B: right right and so the and the government has to do what they can to try to control it and 

513.73 514.79 A: yeah 

517.71 519.32 A: right right 

518.36 525.30 B: not act from paranoia and not act from fear it but to act from confidence or with a clear head you know 

521.41 522.55 A: right 

524.63 534.97 A: yeah you have to i think that's where it is you have to think what would be ah right and wrong you've got the common sense that ah you gotta do it the common sense will make it better it ah ah

558.02 561.16 A: i know they're the the government's being ah 

561.46 570.30 A: they wonder that they teach the people what's going on but they have i think there's more than what they're telling us there might there might be more you know what i mean 

567.85 569.01 B: oh sure 

569.70 572.79 B: i think there is i'm sure there is there's a lot we don't know 

571.14 582.80 A: oh yeah i mean besides the anthrax and poison ah poison the water do this they there're probably a few things that they have found and have never been put in the paper or not even addressed to the public 

582.24 584.88 B: right i agree there probably is 

582.88 584.09 A: (( so ah )) 

584.21 594.30 A: yeah it's d- it's to what ah d- that we find out afterwards after they find out when they're locking pr- and close the k- ah throw away the key and then nobody knows what's going on 

588.03 589.54 B: (( an- and kn- and ))
