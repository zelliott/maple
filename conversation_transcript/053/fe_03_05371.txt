3.77 7.01 B: hey bill w- i'm doing pretty good where are you 

6.84 8.44 A: california 

8.36 11.51 B: oh okay not that far from me i'm in arizona 

11.25 13.89 A: oh okay i'm out here in 

14.22 18.45 A: overcast and what we consider cool orange county [laughter] 

18.70 28.46 B: ah well i got to tell you i wish i was there right now because it's about a hundred and ten degrees outside and it doesn't seem to be letting up and 

28.42 28.98 A: [mn] 

28.70 36.87 B: um oh for this time of year i would jump at the opportunity to go to california especially down to the beach there in newport beach where you are 

35.78 37.08 A: [laughter] 

38.01 42.23 A: yeah well i guess our subject is minimum wage ah [laughter] 

43.70 45.04 B: yeah 

43.72 45.33 A: well i've got ah 

45.38 49.53 A: i have mixed feelings about that having been in business management for 

50.38 53.41 A: a good portion of my life ah [laughter] i 

54.01 55.86 A: mean you know ah 

56.34 61.76 A: i consider just how much should government do in private lives and ah 

62.67 67.67 A: i don't know you got the minimum wage is definitely not anything that's liveable [laughter] 

67.78 69.34 A: i mean even what they're 

70.14 74.87 A: talking about raising it too it's it's not a liveable wage so 

75.70 81.80 A: i'm not sure how much good it does at the level that they're talking about ah 

82.83 87.49 A: my feeling is you either make it liveable or forget it [laughter] 

87.99 91.87 B: yeah about the only thing it's good for is maybe some kid 

92.46 99.46 B: coming out of s- yeah you know to guarantee some kid a minimum wage but that that doesn't mean anything either 

92.54 93.47 A: right 

99.11 110.50 A: yeah i mean i've i've got a ah twenty year old living with me because he's making ah barely above the minimum and he sure as heck can't afford to ah get out on his own [laughter] so 

111.78 116.11 B: well i know i you know i ah i have ah ten employees 

116.28 117.84 B: and 

118.11 123.48 B: they they they make between maybe nine dollars an hour and twenty five dollars an hour 

121.44 122.46 A: mhm 

123.40 124.56 A: yeah 

123.94 128.15 B: and hey they're just they're just making it on what they have 

127.94 130.98 A: well see being being a small business ah 

131.91 135.35 A: you know you're you're the type of individual who 

135.90 138.29 A: gets hurt by 

138.35 140.48 A: any loss of this type 

141.74 147.22 A: ah most small businesses are are not making a great amount of money 

147.64 150.59 B: no we we just you know we try to hold on 

150.36 152.67 A: right and ah 

153.29 161.34 A: you know it you're the ones that i think really get put in the squeeze by anything to do with minimum wage type laws 

161.76 165.00 A: ah most of the bigger more profitable companies 

165.47 168.81 A: you know they can afford it i mean that's a 

170.04 173.97 A: they can afford it better if they took it out of the right places [laughter] 

174.04 178.90 A: like ah executive salaries and perks and 

179.74 183.30 B: (( and ah you know on the other side of the coin you you you get some people )) 

179.91 180.64 A: ah 

183.68 193.26 B: who the minimum wage isn't enough because they're going to make more money than minimum wage getting ah disability or getting ah welfare 

192.60 198.86 A: right right which it discourages them from ah going to to take a job 

199.49 202.31 A: i know in in california ah 

202.51 214.67 A: in the last few years of course they have a law now here that you know ah welfare is ah aimed at needy children and stuff like that is is limited and ah they help you 

214.84 221.34 A: help the recipients find employment to get 'em off and and the people have to take the work 

221.93 224.47 A: or lose their benefits so i mean 

224.61 226.37 A: but even so ah 

227.10 228.06 B: (( well )) 

227.31 231.66 A: sometimes what they get back like you say is less than their benefits [laughter] 

231.80 236.45 B: right and then also here for you know i'm in construction 

236.56 249.05 B: you you you can't find people to do the job ah legally ah some some of these subcontractors are forced to hire people illegally and and pay them less than minimum wage 

246.19 247.46 A: mhm 

248.90 250.50 A: right 

250.26 256.42 B: and there're certainly plenty of workers out there willing to work for whatever they can get 

256.19 259.00 A: mhm yeah 

258.27 259.22 B: so 

259.41 269.40 B: so you might be right sometimes it's best if government just leaves their hand out of it and let let the system dictate what people should ah should make 

267.64 268.87 A: right 

269.23 270.25 A: i mean 

270.49 273.75 A: you know unless there's unless there's collusion 

274.94 277.28 A: people will pay 

278.61 282.98 A: what they have to and and what they can afford to get the proper help 

283.87 285.19 B: correct 

284.57 288.64 A: and i think it balances itself out to where 

288.82 292.79 A: people get a correct wage for what they do i 

292.89 294.58 B: correct that's right 

294.03 300.71 A: mean yeah in in the old days where you have all the the few rich businessmen colluding [laughter] 

300.60 309.54 A: to not give better salaries or benefits and that you know you could understand part of it but in today's age and and there again though 

306.00 307.21 B: right 

309.75 314.11 A: as the wages go up ah this this moves everything off shore 

315.14 319.94 B: that's correct it's ultimately what happens ah to consumers 

316.11 316.86 A: so 

318.04 323.82 A: mini- minimum wage is even the minimum wage is even too much for them to want to pay 

319.97 321.18 B: the end users 

325.31 331.72 A: you know i mean i helped set up plants in mexico for a company i worked for and ah 

332.55 335.78 A: well we had people up here were making ah 

336.35 341.06 A: ten dollars an hour and we had people down there making seven fifty a day 

341.60 342.91 B: incredible 

342.77 347.01 A: yeah and i mean it [laughter] from a i mean you know 

347.15 352.22 A: and it it to somebody like me it was very 

352.84 353.70 A: ah 

353.77 356.25 A: it it pulled me in different directions 

356.73 366.71 A: 'cause basically i'm a compassionate person and on the other side i'm wearing my management hat [laughter] you know and i'm saying what's best for the company 

362.72 363.94 B: right 

366.52 367.58 B: right 

367.27 368.64 A: but ah 

369.17 378.18 A: and and that's one of the main problems i i see in this country today is that we lost our middle class manufacturing base 

379.82 383.64 A: and they say we still have a lot of manufacturing here but we really don't 

380.27 381.06 B: you 

383.59 385.05 B: we don't no 

384.77 393.82 A: we we really don't and it you know when you look at all the unemployment figures now it's the manufacturing sector that that's really hurting 

394.28 395.54 B: yes [noise] 

395.55 396.56 A: so 

397.34 398.25 A: (( i )) 

400.18 404.32 A: i don't know the back to the subject of minimum wage it's ah 

406.53 411.80 A: ah it's not liveable so why have it 

406.63 407.96 B: (( yeah it )) 

412.46 415.35 A: like like i say and and there again 

416.99 418.33 A: i i think it 

418.75 423.39 A: how how do you apply it and where do you exempt it you know 

423.39 424.87 B: (( yeah like i'm )) 

423.43 427.26 A: i mean 'cause you you can't kill small business 

427.72 434.54 B: no and and i think ah you also have pockets ah especially in orange county as you do and parts of phoenix 

434.86 435.72 B: (( ah )) 

435.88 441.17 B: where it doesn't matter what the minimum wage is you still can't get the help there 

441.31 442.37 B: (( ah )) 

442.81 451.94 B: and for the people who work for that wage sometimes the kids won't 'cause they they they'll they they get allowances or other benefits more than that 

447.07 447.96 A: right 

451.82 463.89 B: ah so you have to get people ah out on the fringes that are willing to work but it does they can't afford it because the the cost of travel to get to those places is above so much above minimum wage 

461.28 462.44 A: mhm 

464.00 475.83 A: yeah they they have communities i know when i lived in northern california they have ah several communities up there ah north of pleasant and that where they have to actually 

477.01 486.73 A: pay the workers more to bring 'em in because the area's so affluent that the kids there won't do those those type jobs 

483.68 484.59 B: yeah 

487.13 491.47 A: because they get more in allowance [laughter] 

489.66 492.76 B: yeah it's it's absolutely amazing 

491.97 497.45 A: so they they have to pay actually they have to pay the hamburger flippers and and the lower wage 

497.73 507.59 A: people more because they have to import 'em but the but the people can't afford to live in the area they work in which i think is a shame ah 

508.22 510.51 B: yeah it it's amazing 

510.36 511.34 A: yeah but 

511.47 516.28 A: but then minimum wage isn't going to help that because the only way you're going to help that is if you 

516.40 520.89 A: increase the minimum wage to like fifteen dollars an hour 

520.99 527.31 A: at least and and that's going to play havoc with small businesses 

527.43 529.10 B: ab- absolutely 

529.94 535.64 A: yeah so [laughter] i mean w- what are you going to do are are you going to drive all the small businesses out 

535.73 539.80 A: and just go back to having nothing but large conglomerates ah 

540.55 542.56 A: that sure won't help [laughter] 

542.66 543.60 B: no 

543.81 550.57 B: no and now and this minimum wage it it it is that is a it's not a state law it's a federal law is that correct 

550.01 552.49 A: right yeah that's 

551.23 554.56 B: yeah you and you can't and that's and that's wrong you can't 

554.62 560.11 B: you can't [sigh] you can't dictate that across country you know somewhere in tulsa oklahoma 

559.71 560.80 A: right 

560.19 564.81 B: ah [sigh] is not the same as downtown los angeles california 

564.72 571.52 A: right i mean you ah you go into some major poverty pockets yeah yeah minimum wage to them would be great 

572.67 573.78 A: but ah 

574.02 576.14 A: not in most of the country 

576.15 577.41 B: (( [mn] )) 

578.12 579.11 A: (( so )) 

578.38 579.33 B: (( i don't know )) 

580.67 585.97 A: yeah i i don't think legislation is going to solve the [laughter] problem but i 

585.16 587.15 B: no you're right the the ah 

586.05 589.29 A: really don't i i think the one thing y- y- you have to 

590.51 592.27 A: stop people 

592.91 596.20 A: from exporting their business out of the country 

596.83 599.89 A: so that you put more jobs in this country so there's m-
