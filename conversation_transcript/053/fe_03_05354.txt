289.30 290.58 A: [laughter] 

295.82 296.63 A: (( oh yes )) 

300.08 300.97 A: okay 

300.67 312.55 B: and a couple of my cousins that i'm close to like they all go to college for computers and like everyone's into computers i just i hate 'em i don't know why like you know how when something goes wrong and on the computer it's like 

312.68 321.85 B: it could be one of like a million freaking things i can't stand that like i like if i have a problem i want to be able to find the problem and just fix it 

315.04 316.72 A: oh yeah i hate that 

319.90 326.13 A: yeah i mean i really wish computers were like uh as easy to use as like a t._v. you know 

326.18 327.70 B: yeah 

327.75 330.06 A: (( like if th- i think it's )) 

328.78 336.82 B: yeah like i just hate like i like like say cars you know something goes wrong you have an idea of what's wrong i mean maybe it's just 'cause i'm 

336.85 344.49 B: not educated enough in computers so i'm kind of ignorant but i just i just don't i can't stand them enough to even learn about 'em you know 

340.10 342.95 A: well yeah 

343.68 348.07 A: i think like the thing with computers is that 'cause we're like using them a lot you know 

347.97 349.42 B: yeah 

349.07 353.14 A: so i don't know i just use um computers a lot since i was in fifth grade 

349.99 351.14 B: i just [noise] 

352.97 354.26 B: (( really )) 

353.70 355.46 A: yeah 

354.45 358.18 B: i just don't have patience with 'em i don't i don't know 

356.84 364.48 A: but they annoy me still like you know despite like all experience i mean i still get annoyed by them i think they're not perfect at all 

361.90 362.99 B: yeah 

364.23 374.60 B: yeah and then i think i think uh all these software companies write uh glitches in on purpose and s- and like everything they put out you know 

372.77 376.97 A: yeah so that's like people who buy like net versions and upgrade them 

376.36 378.51 B: yeah and it's ridiculous 

377.21 385.84 A: i mean yeah they leave out important features because they realize they can sell it without those features so that they can put in the network and i mean that it's all marketing 

384.94 390.75 B: yeah and my computer at home uh i hate computers even more because my computer sucks 

386.16 386.90 A: so 

390.96 394.82 B: i have a dell from like eight years ago or something 

391.13 392.09 A: oh 

393.68 396.41 A: okay so yeah it must be really slow now 

395.87 405.07 B: yeah it's pretty slow and [mn] i live in montana so i'm not going to buy a computer myself i don't care i don't use it enough but my dad won't buy a new one because 

402.59 403.47 A: (( okay )) 

404.98 415.74 B: he bought it when computers were like so expensive so he i guess he remembers spending like two grand on it or whatever and um he he has put a lot of upgrades in it like you know a new hard drive [mn] 

415.79 422.82 B: uh c._d. writer drive you know all that junk but i think all the stuff that he put on just makes it slower 

418.91 420.12 A: right 

423.11 428.34 B: like there's too many programs and stuff it's just not fast enough to handle it and it it's always crashing 

428.23 429.22 A: (( okay )) 

429.44 430.82 B: (( so i don't know )) 

431.29 434.03 B: [noise] uh what do you think about uh 

434.64 437.71 B: the whole iraq war thing being from the middle east 

436.45 441.37 A: oh well i'm not exactly from the middle east i'm i'm from a muslim country though 

441.22 453.16 A: and and they feel sympathetic towards like muslims you know like uh all over the world so iraq is a muslim country so i mean people in my country they feel that this war was like too much you know and a sign of american arrogance 

441.45 442.32 B: uh-huh 

453.22 454.18 B: uh-huh 

453.71 460.55 A: and i mean i somewhat see that but i also see that like uh a g- i mean a really good thing we've done for the iraqi people 

460.75 461.88 B: yeah 

461.29 467.54 A: i mean i don't support it on the grounds of the weapons of mass destruction i support on a humanitarian ground you know 

467.22 469.83 B: yeah yeah i think that's the way most people feel 

467.78 475.84 A: but those people i mean that guy was a was a was a psycho like the guy who was ruling them i mean he wasn't good for anybody there 

473.15 474.03 B: uh-huh 

475.69 476.52 B: yeah 

475.91 480.80 A: i mean he tortured and killed like people in his country like in mass you know 

480.87 484.53 B: [noise] yeah i think i think the main problem is i don't think um 

485.16 486.68 B: (( [lipsmack] u._s. really knew that they )) 

486.64 501.30 B: uh not that they don't know what they're getting theirselves into but i think a lot of the public thinks like so it's going to be like a conventional war or like we're going to go in you know fight a little bit and then that'll be it i don't think people know that this is just the beginning and it's going to take at least ten years like 

498.84 510.46 A: no that's uh that's the thing yeah i mean to leave to leave them in this state right now it's going to just leave leave them to more chaos whatever weapons have gone missing 'cause i mean 

501.17 503.41 B: to set the government up and 

507.70 509.04 B: yeah mhm [noise] 

510.62 514.50 A: the u._s. is concerned that there c- like um what do you say 

514.62 529.17 A: convinced that there are weapons and now they're nowhere to be found where are they who has them you know that's the key thing i mean those weapons need to be found before they end up in the wrong hands i mean those things are important rebuilding their society is important i mean they had like bombs dropped on them you know 

518.56 519.50 B: yeah 

528.87 541.67 B: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah i'm quite surprised they haven't found anything yet 'cause i mean i have read a lot about you know they they went in based on bad information and all that stuff but then you gotta think well why was saddam 

542.09 553.62 B: you know so pushy with the u._n. and u._n. guys and all that stuff if he didn't have anything so like i'm s- you know so it's it's already been you know a while since the war ended it's like when are they going to find something 

546.51 547.78 A: right 

552.86 558.24 A: so i mean that makes it even more important for for them to find those weapons 

557.29 559.55 B: yes yeah yeah i totally agree 

559.80 561.41 A: so yeah i mean i don't know 

560.40 562.98 B: that was the justification for going in you know 

562.75 567.59 A: yeah i mean and if they're not found then i mean it's scary that like somebody else could have them you know 

567.51 573.42 B: yeah now being from the middle east like after sep- september eleventh and everything 

573.44 574.63 B: (( do you )) 

574.84 578.56 B: have you experienced any problems like profiling or anything like that 

577.91 578.99 A: um 

579.24 585.74 A: not not a whole lot i know other people have like people i know like friends i have they have experienced it 

582.28 583.31 B: yeah 

585.47 586.32 B: yeah 

585.63 599.72 A: although like i have uh experienced uh more scrutiny than i had before like when crossing borders to go into canada for example or and reentering the u._s. and things like that i think that they were more strict with me than they had been in the past 

595.58 596.67 B: mhm
