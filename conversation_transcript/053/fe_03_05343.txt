468.07 469.34 A: (( boston now )) 

470.41 473.02 B: a psychology major or something and then 

472.59 474.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] ))

489.32 500.08 B: yeah i'm not a h- i i don't really um i've sort of changed my mind i'm not sure what i'm going to do now but it's i don't think it's going to be computer science 'cause it's like there aren't very many jobs out there for that and [noise] 

499.23 502.80 A: [noise] yeah yeah now see that's why i'm like trying to 

503.94 513.16 A: think of something i want to do something you know something that'll work first because i don't like the fact that i'm going to spend all this money on taking classes on something i don't i'm not going to need you know 

506.19 507.08 B: yeah 

512.78 518.96 B: yeah you shouldn't um definitely don't go into computers i'll tell you that [laughter] [mn] it's just not worth it 

517.09 520.48 A: yeah i mean it it looks like it's on a downhill 

520.33 521.78 B: yeah 

521.11 522.78 A: roll anyway you know 

521.86 534.24 B: i think like doing something i think if you go to college and you study like something that's interesting to you like i don't know english or history or psychology whatever that's great otherwise [sigh] if you're not going to do that you might as well do something like business or engineering 

532.66 533.59 A: what 

533.71 542.10 A: yeah but as much as i like that it's not a very marketable thing you know like if i if i major in english what the fuck am i going to do you know become a english teacher i mean 

540.98 548.13 B: [mn] i guess so well you can you can go out and go to like grad school or something if you want but what's the point i i agree with you there's really no point but 

546.87 549.07 A: yeah i mean psychology i mean 

549.08 554.57 A: great deal everyone loves it but you what what i mean you can't have a million freaking psychologists out there you know 

553.97 555.54 B: i know you can't 

554.97 562.64 A: so i mean i a lot of my friends do that you know what do you want to be a psychologist' but it's like it's like i mean we're all want to be psychologists here that doesn't really work you know i 

562.01 563.77 B: i know i agree with you 

562.77 571.13 A: mean i i yeah i'm not everyone has mental problems either [laughter] i mean it's diff- difficult doesn't work like we're out of water a psychologist 

566.28 567.46 B: i know 

570.49 571.80 B: exactly 

571.18 575.60 A: it's like i don't know many people that actually even go to a psychologist so you know i mean 

574.47 579.53 B: i know well [mn] i think there there's certainly there's plenty of wackos out there and here and but uh 

578.52 584.53 A: well yeah but they don't they're not going to admit it and go to a psychologist really you know i mean th- that's a different story [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

581.94 583.62 B: that's true that's true 

584.15 585.84 B: i don't know i think um 

585.94 598.68 B: i think that like the only thing is i mean if you go to a decent school and you get a degree in something you can get a job doing s- stuff but it doesn't have to like it doesn't have to be related to your major i mean you can do your psychology major and you can go on and be like a 

598.93 599.89 B: you know like a
