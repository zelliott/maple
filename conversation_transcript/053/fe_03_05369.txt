2.71 5.78 A: ah jay fair from connecticut 

8.46 9.24 A: (( [mn] )) 

9.43 12.45 B: (( hello hey how's it going )) 

10.05 11.67 A: hi mark 

11.94 13.19 A: good you 

13.21 15.54 B: doing pretty good you're from connecticut huh 

15.09 21.23 A: well actually i've lived in illinois a while when i was a kid um you ever hear of perria 

21.11 25.20 B: oh yeah yeah i'm from i'm from wheaton area i'm actually at western springs ah 

27.21 31.12 B: i grew up in wheaton so a couple of hours away from perria not too far 

30.69 35.60 A: oh i see okay i was just outside of perria in a town called roanoke 

35.50 36.67 B: (( oh okay )) 

36.31 37.56 A: [laughter] 

36.93 38.59 B: (( yeah i know where that is )) 

37.98 41.07 A: do you really wow neat 

39.00 40.08 B: yeah 

40.12 41.98 B: that's funny [laughter] 

41.13 43.22 A: yeah ah 

43.13 46.89 B: so ah so we have talk about minimum wage so what do you think huh 

47.02 52.36 A: i boy i can't imagine anybody making a living on that um 

47.18 48.36 B: (( the increase )) 

51.85 52.89 B: [laughter] 

52.85 58.74 A: [laughter] at least not out here i don't know how things are in illinois right now but ah 

59.46 62.41 A: i think they'd have a pretty tough time of it here 

62.70 64.37 A: what do you think 

62.78 71.22 B: well i think that oh yeah i mean i don't think ah that usually what happens is when the minimum wage goes up it usually increases everybody a little bit hopefully 

71.09 77.35 B: you know so i mean if even if you're even if you're on a salary job hopefully an employer will look at that as 

71.58 72.54 A: yeah 

77.12 91.39 B: they're saying that you know if it if it went up fifteen percent minimum wage hopefully your salary should reflect some of that some of that increase but now if you're if you're trying to make it on six bucks an hour [laughter] you know you better be in high school and under your parents' roof i suppose 

87.60 88.36 A: (( mm )) 

91.03 97.67 A: yeah those are probably the kind of people that ah will take those kind of jobs unless you're pretty desperate i guess 

97.09 107.36 B: yeah i i guess you're pretty desperate do you think that ah i mean i i don't know i've had some jobs in the past where when the salary went up when the minimum wage went up like i don't know this was like four five years ago when it went up you know my salary 

107.45 114.07 B: um went up within a a month or two of that of that minimum wage too have you seen that to be the case or no 

113.59 119.50 A: yeah you know i never even thought about that i don't know that's a good question 

119.71 120.91 A: (( um )) 

121.23 122.11 A: boy 

122.35 126.84 A: i'd really like to know i'd like to go back you say that was about four years' ago 

127.18 131.96 B: well yeah it was like four or five years ago when i went up to like um what's it at right now is it a five 

132.33 136.14 A: i'm not sure i really haven't kept track [laughter] 

132.45 133.74 B: five fifty 

133.94 141.36 B: i'm not i'm not i i don't think i ever worked for minimum wage even when i was in high school 'cause i found a job where you where i worked for tips so 

141.08 142.78 A: yeah oh yeah 

141.45 152.96 B: um but back then ah you know back in in college even when i was a server um the week after my ah you know when you're serving you only make like you know two seventy five an hour and then you make a lot of tips 

152.65 153.45 A: yeah 

152.81 158.68 B: i worked at out back steak house and when they went up to like five fifteen or whatever my ah my 

158.73 162.46 B: ah hourly pay went from two seventy five to three oh nine 

162.05 163.91 A: (( really ah )) 

162.76 168.18 B: yeah within a within a week within a week of of them raising the minimum wage now maybe because 

168.22 175.48 B: you know i was hourly and i'm not sure but um and then my salary that you know was the same was the same way one time when it went up so 

175.46 180.15 A: mm oh that's interesting ah it all helps to watch that 

176.24 178.41 B: [laughter] i don't know that 

178.60 179.73 B: yeah i mean well 

179.82 189.56 B: when you think about it that's where you know it should actually go up just because if the if the government's saying that five fifteen an hour you know isn't enough and they raise it to six or whatever and then proportionally 

182.86 183.80 A: yeah 

189.52 197.23 B: across the board you know everyone's salary should go up proportionally you know well maybe that won't go up the en- entire amount but it should go up somewhat 

197.15 198.96 A: yeah 

197.31 198.47 B: um 

199.62 207.23 B: so if someone's making you know twenty thousand or fifty thousand it should go up proportionally you'd think to what a minimum wage went up 

207.14 210.10 A: yeah yeah that's a good point um 

210.61 214.75 A: hm i may have to watch that and see what happens in the future you know 

215.18 216.07 A: so 

216.17 226.34 A: you know i i think it's a good thing then if that's true if that's the case and it does seem to be you know it it affects the ah you know a lot of people in a positive way 

220.03 221.57 B: (( yeah )) 

226.50 236.37 A: now of course the employer that might be a different [laughter] scenario you know they probably grit their teeth when something like that happens but ah 

235.93 237.16 B: yeah 

236.53 237.62 A: you know 

237.77 239.42 A: um i 

239.76 246.65 A: you know the ap apparently for there are signs of the economy turning around and um 

247.07 252.58 A: maybe the employer will be in more of a position where they can pay a higher wage 

252.73 254.84 A: as a result one hopes mm 

254.88 258.67 B: yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure w- the economy is not a 

258.72 261.14 B: is not doing so hot so i'm not sure 

261.35 262.49 B: (( you know ah )) 

262.68 269.23 B: when this is going to turn around or no they they keep you know cutting interest rates and everyone's refinancing and 

268.58 269.90 A: right 

269.29 272.44 B: i don't know it's hard to tell it's hard to see 

271.84 274.03 A: ah yeah yeah it 

272.88 273.90 B: (( what i )) 

275.01 284.62 B: mean i'm not i'm not hear i'm not hearing this in the on the the stock market here in chicago and you know things you know the only people that are doing well right now are the people in the bonds so 

275.17 276.42 A: (( is [sigh] )) 

284.52 286.10 A: yeah yeah right 

284.79 291.86 B: um i don't i [laughter] i don't know that i i think the minimum wage thing is probab- it is when is it supposed to increase do we know is it or 

292.37 303.99 A: i don't know you know i wish i would have known the topic before hand so i could ah [noise] checked it out a little more but unfortunately they don't give you the topic till you're you're on the phone you know 

303.49 304.92 B: no you're right 

304.06 310.82 A: [laughter] so i couldn't really do any research on this but ah it certainly raises an interesting um 

311.61 312.43 A: (( ah )) 

312.81 317.00 A: some interesting thought here you know now i'm curious [laughter] 

316.37 323.39 B: [laughter] you know i i know ah i know employers like a well have had tried to fight you know fight the minimum wage 'cause they they you know they 

323.26 337.39 B: talk about how it it ruins you know their profits and all the stuff but um 'cause i mean realistically i mean minimum like i like what we said before minimum wage isn't isn't enough to live on i don't know anywhere i mean if you figure minimum wage at five bucks an hour 

327.64 328.61 A: right 

337.61 340.86 B: you're looking at probably just over four after taxes 

341.06 342.05 A: yeah 

341.14 348.18 B: you know you work forty hours a week that's a hundred and six that's a hundred and sixty bucks a week you know times four 

343.39 344.47 A: (( [laughter] )) 

345.97 347.59 A: yeah that's 

348.24 355.39 B: i mean you're only looking at six forty a month you know i you you you're going to be hard pressed to find a place to live for six forty a month [laughter] 

350.44 351.34 A: yeah 

351.37 352.65 A: yeah that's 

354.84 366.77 A: yeah you c- you can't you can't do it it's it's you know it's got to be for people that aren't relying on it for a regular income like you said kids you know and 

356.70 358.10 B: [laughter] 

366.13 367.35 B: yeah 

366.89 369.54 A: stuff like that or maybe ah 

369.79 374.79 A: someone who wants a little part time job or something you know but ah 

372.96 374.26 B: yeah 

375.03 375.95 A: certainly 

375.08 376.01 B: (( out here )) 

376.18 376.85 A: mm 

376.24 386.61 B: out here it's amazing people people ah pay babysitters you know seven seven to eleven dollars an hour out here and um i mean that's for a lot of care you know that's a lot there's an exception but 

386.27 387.19 A: yeah 

386.46 395.44 B: um two kids in the high school group i work with um you know they make seven and eight dollars an hour sometimes nine dollars an hour babysitting depending on how many kids they have so 

395.30 396.24 A: sure 

395.90 409.43 B: ah i used to i mean i i know when when my parents used to talk about you know a long time ago they used to get a babysitter for me they used to talk about i think you know it was always under a minimum wage and now it almost seems like childcare has gotten to the point babysitting where you're over minimum wage 

396.41 397.19 A: yeah 

409.71 420.53 A: yeah yeah i you know some of the lowest paying jobs out here are like seven to eight dollars an hour no matter what it is ah babysitting ah 

418.23 419.21 B: yeah 

420.75 427.25 A: you know the kid doing the line work or shoveling the snow or whatever you just can't get 'em for 

425.63 426.43 B: yeah 

427.66 430.76 A: under that so you know i 

430.90 432.33 A: how realistic 

432.35 434.46 A: minimum wage thing is 

434.56 435.54 A: you know 

435.65 441.93 A: i haven't seen a job anywhere or heard anybody ah getting minimum wage 

440.90 443.23 B: [mn] oh oh you haven't really 

442.74 446.05 A: no not not recently out here anyway 

443.42 444.56 B: (( oh okay )) 

444.93 454.15 B: there's act- th- there's actually there's actually a few places out here that ah that offer no raises pretty much and there's the the the public library i got a kid i know ah 

453.92 463.09 B: in my high school group that works at the public library and worked there for nine months but he's still at minimum wage five fifteen an hour now that that's what if that's the minimum wage it's five fifteen i guess 'cause 

459.85 461.30 A: really 

463.17 471.01 B: (( that's what he was saying he got paid he's been there for nine months and i'm like you got to find a new job [laughter] i mean that's just insane you know he's )) 

471.04 480.35 B: he's like ah the hours are fine you know but i mean that's just that's just piddly change and then um another guy i know um no actually a girl works at um 

475.42 476.48 A: yeah 

480.48 484.31 B: it was like a white hen or something and she's just under six dollars an hour so 

484.20 485.69 A: wow 

485.28 488.73 B: yeah but most like i said most people i know you know they're 

488.78 494.68 B: ah because i work with them you know even the walmart's paying in the the high sixes and stuff like that i mean i don't 

493.55 495.87 A: true yeah yeah 

495.24 496.88 B: (( [laughter] it's )) 

496.21 499.51 A: yeah oh that's um 

500.86 509.30 A: yeah boy i'm just racking my brain here trying to think of somebody i know earning minimum wage but i don't or some place that does [noise] 

506.91 513.32 B: a yeah but it probably wouldn't be up here [laughter] you'd you'd hope a i don't think it would probably be up here you got to think of 

509.64 510.48 A: huh 

512.86 514.01 A: yeah 

513.33 515.48 B: probably some kids or something i don't know 

514.91 519.71 A: right yeah yeah i so you know 

520.12 523.38 A: i'm just trying to think of some of the jobs that would pay 

523.50 525.62 A: minimum wage but ah 

525.88 529.20 B: well are you near a college are you ah where in connecticut are you 

529.84 533.88 A: um i'm outside of hartford in in a suburb of hartford 

534.23 535.20 B: okay 

535.39 537.07 A: so i don't know 

536.26 540.16 B: and how far are you how far are you from what's the nearest college right near you 

540.32 548.20 A: that would be ah u._c._o._n. and ah yeah it's it's not real close it's about a half hour drive from here maybe 

543.09 543.82 B: (( okay )) 

548.41 551.21 A: so maybe some of the kids out [noise] there 

551.73 553.56 A: you know might ah 

553.27 555.12 B: you know the college campus maybe 

553.75 554.54 A: (( be )) 

554.82 559.65 A: sure yeah at a book store or something a college bookstore or something maybe but 

559.68 570.63 B: a lot of times college college places you know they they're able to pay a lot less just because they have some you know especially at a big campus because they have a lot of kids that are willing to work for not much money so 

570.28 573.15 A: right yeah that's true 

573.78 574.42 B: (( [mn] ah )) 

574.99 583.19 B: no i i guess if this raise goes through like they're like they're talking about i don't think it's i don't you know i you know i asked before i don't i don't know which when it's going through or if it has 

583.06 584.06 A: (( yep ah uh-huh mm )) 

583.07 590.74 B: um you know i suppose you look at the the increase i think it's they're looking at going up to close to six i think is what they talked about 

590.88 596.82 B: so that's a what a twenty about a twenty percent increase well a little less than that i guess 

596.98 599.13 B: a little less than twenty percent which i guess 

599.53 599.89 B: (( in ))
