92.60 98.29 A: excellent i don't think i've ever met a husky owner who isn't completely devoted to their pet so 

93.77 94.46 B: yep 

98.43 99.99 B: uh to uh different what 

99.97 105.43 A: i said i don't think i've ever known somebody with a husky who wasn't completely devoted to their dog so 

104.99 108.98 B: [laughter] yeah i we get along 

107.53 110.99 A: seems to attract a particular type of uh owner 

111.12 117.34 B: yep he's a good dog he's very playful and yeah it's a great dog 

117.35 123.43 B: likes to get into trouble you know you gotta watch him and whenever you're like taking him on a walk or 

117.38 117.94 A: (( yeah )) 

123.80 130.51 B: on a jog you'd better be ready 'cause he's going to [laughter] he's going to be pulling you all over the neighborhood yeah 

129.32 130.54 A: right 

130.67 137.54 A: i have a cat um i like dogs but uh cats fit my lifestyle better i um 

130.68 131.75 B: and i'd uh 

133.02 133.73 B: (( yep )) 

136.46 138.90 B: yeah i can understand that i guess 

138.92 145.37 A: i'm not necessarily home at any kind of regular schedule and dogs dogs need to be able to run 

145.78 148.01 B: yeah that is very true 

146.33 147.05 A: (( cats )) 

147.68 149.96 A: much more independent than a 

150.10 157.41 A: when they're left alone i i sometimes wish i got to spend more time i don't think he cares as much [laughter] 

156.54 159.40 B: yeah they are kind of antisocial aren't they [noise] 

159.06 164.98 A: he he he doesn't care but i wish i could spend more time with him because it's relaxing to just stop and play 

165.28 166.88 A: so he's a 

167.41 178.19 A: i wanted him for oh probably about eight years i'd thought about getting my cat but i was always moving and in different apartments and not in a position where i could really have one 

178.24 183.68 A: and uh the time finally came i said okay it's time and i'd known all along i wanted a 

183.73 184.93 A: um 

185.79 189.45 A: uh american shorthair silver classic tabby 

189.32 190.56 B: mhm 

189.86 195.50 A: um which is funny they don't make or nobody in the area that i'm in breeds those 

195.31 196.06 B: yeah 

195.37 203.38 A: so i had to have it imported from uh california sent to me on a plane and it looks just like a cat [laughter] 

198.60 199.61 B: oh 

203.14 216.96 A: like they're not exotic at all it's just like the platonic ideal of your standard tabby but the markings are perfect uh i had a lot of my friends laugh at me because i paid a lot of money to get something that just looks like a cat [laughter] 

203.17 204.41 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

210.78 211.89 B: okay 

216.74 219.99 B: yeah but the markings are perfect so it was worth it 

218.87 223.30 A: they are and the demeanor that comes with that breed is amazing 

223.07 224.38 B: yeah 

223.89 225.04 A: ah he's 

225.42 236.45 A: like sweet but without being you know a complete pushover like he still plays uh he's got some tendencies to act like a dog like he'll play fetch which is really nice 

229.71 230.60 B: [laughter] 

231.09 232.19 B: yeah 

236.44 241.24 A: [noise] um 'cause most cats will just ignore you when you try to play with them like that 

240.64 254.85 B: [laughter] yeah i actually uh i think one of my first jobs um was actually looking after a neighbor's cat while they were over like summer vacation and uh 

254.76 260.34 B: anyway i was a y- young teenager i guess and and uh so 

260.60 266.68 B: i and i i must have done it probably for probably two or three summers 

266.72 272.80 B: whenever they went on vacation i would take care of the cat so yeah i have you know worked with cats you know 

266.92 267.84 A: excellent 

272.15 273.75 A: you like cats at all 

273.77 278.62 B: yeah i like 'em i just couldn't get over the whole litter box thing it's like 

278.01 279.38 A: yeah 

278.77 280.55 B: (( yeah you know it's )) 

280.58 287.11 B: you know with with my dog you know i can just walk him around and take him to a spot he does his business and then 

287.42 292.25 B: you know it's not like it's sitting in your house in a little box until 

291.30 292.27 A: true 

292.42 294.80 B: whenever you have to clean it so i yeah i 

293.92 294.90 A: (( it's kind of )) 

294.91 301.24 A: funny how that works because i've got a cat for pretty much the same reasons not like i mean 

301.32 312.26 A: not because i don't want to deal with the litter box but because to me it's easier to just let him go in there and do his thing and when at my convenience i can go versus a dog where you have to go like when they're ready 

307.01 307.96 B: yeah 

312.43 327.34 B: [laughter] yeah that's true i do k- have to kind of uh cater my schedule to him where but i mean he does the same where he knows you know he knows that i'll be up and take him out at six forty five and then when i get back you know i'll take him out again 

313.26 314.19 A: (( you know )) 

314.70 315.66 A: (( and i find like )) 

321.87 323.08 A: (( yeah and i )) 

326.00 330.40 A: i just think its funny like both of our choices are partially based on 

330.71 336.77 A: not necessarily being lazy but like i view the one as being easier and you view the other as being easier 

336.30 337.53 B: yep 

337.42 339.94 A: so just totally differences 

339.29 347.67 B: yeah it's on preferences yep that makes sense though that we would well i mean i it's you know i haven't always been like this it's you know i do 

347.02 349.04 A: oh yeah yeah 

348.35 356.42 B: i actually uh when i'm not around uh my father ends up taking care of him but i mean he i think he do- has the same schedule where he'll 

356.57 360.36 B: take him out in the morning and after he gets off work and uh 

360.98 366.40 B: you know it's uh we work at the same place so about pretty same hours [noise] 

366.48 369.61 A: that's good do you have a yard for him to run in 

369.62 375.57 B: yep but uh we haven't set up the electrical fence yet we're still working on that 

375.69 382.07 B: and you know we're planning on getting one for him but as of right now you know he's got a 

382.15 391.40 B: a pretty good sized deck to run about um that's his whole area it it goes out from like the second floor of our house 

391.75 393.70 B: (( and so he gets to )) 

393.78 399.20 B: chill out on the deck it's nice and uh there's lots of big trees out there some 

399.33 409.09 B: nice cedar trees to give him some shade and uh he's got a great view [laughter] i- i'm jealous [laughter] he's got a beautiful view that's like you know 

399.39 400.34 A: cool 

403.88 405.80 A: excellent yeah decks right 

409.05 416.14 B: i mean it's like kentucky hills and a nice forest little lake at the bottom 

416.15 419.05 B: so he just kind of chills out there and 

418.92 427.62 A: uh yeah my cat's excited he's uh strictly indoors uh it was actually the breeder made me promise her i would never let him outdoors 

422.50 424.10 B: (( uh [laughter] )) 

427.20 428.32 B: really 

428.01 437.80 A: when she sold him to me um one because like his parents were never outdoors and their parents were never outdoors 'cause they're bred to be show cats um 

437.91 444.00 A: and he hasn't had one of the um shots that'd you would normally give a cat that was going to be an outdoor cat 

443.77 445.15 B: oh okay 

443.98 444.63 A: uh 

444.49 448.95 A: because it's not necessary unless he's going to encounter other cats and get in fights 

448.76 459.63 A: and there are some risks of getting that shot and so rather than have to take the risks um she just prefers to keep 'em indoors plus you don't have to worry about 'em running in front of cars or anything like that 

449.16 450.26 B: [laughter] 

451.27 452.10 B: yeah 

458.85 469.53 B: yeah my dog has uh gotten out a couple of times you know and i mean this he's fast [laughter] oh man i 

468.17 482.12 A: oh he's happy now we moved uh to a new place that has uh second and third storey decks that are you know far enough away from any trees that i'm not worried about him jumping or anything 'cause he's got to actually get some fresh air 

478.95 479.83 B: yeah 

482.12 491.39 B: yeah that is nice i mean even when you know during the summertime when it's hot it's still you know i still think it's nice especially in the early morning and at night 

491.34 492.17 A: (( yeah )) 

491.50 493.45 B: you know to actually be out there 

493.68 503.34 A: i'm not sure he's ready for it though there are a couple couple of times i've seen him walking along the railing and you know i know he's a cat but he's i've seen 

499.71 501.72 B: yeah [laughter] he'd 

502.50 504.20 B: probably land on his feet 

504.10 510.31 A: i've saw yeah but if he slips the wrong way he'll be in [laughter] the other neighbor's yard 

509.96 514.13 B: yeah so uh what's the name of go ahead 

510.58 511.82 A: [laughter] so far 

513.84 517.51 A: uh no so far he's fine but my cat's name's corbu 

515.85 516.74 B: yeah wh- 

517.81 518.93 B: corpu 

518.98 527.37 A: corbu b. u. like boy yeah he's actually named after a french architect i studied architecture for a while 

520.28 521.25 B: (( corbu )) 

521.94 522.95 B: (( okay )) 

526.98 528.58 B: oh cool 

528.04 529.61 A: (( uh le corbusier )) 

529.62 530.91 A: (( um but )) 

530.09 539.40 B: oh okay yeah i d- you know did the whole proficiency in french in college [laughter] so yeah corbusier that sounds familiar 

535.27 536.61 A: (( oh yeah [mn] )) 

538.45 540.18 A: what's your dog's name 

540.22 548.03 B: his name is rocky and we named him after the university of tennessee fight song 

541.72 542.56 A: rocky 

548.11 553.26 B: because uh both my folks are graduates from the university of tennessee 

553.31 560.12 B: in nashville and about the biggest football fans you'll find of that team so 

560.04 561.02 A: excellent 

560.27 567.52 B: you know it was only natural to [laughter] name him after something about tennessee and we went with rocky 

567.95 573.29 A: yeah we've uh i'm in seattle so we've got huskies everywhere around here 

573.39 574.89 B: [laughter] oh yeah 

573.43 574.41 A: people 

574.55 577.52 A: (( their their football spirit so )) 

577.25 585.07 B: yeah [laughter] that's true i get you bet you do have quite a few yeah we're i think we're the only one in the neighborhood with a husky 

585.25 586.62 B: um 

586.78 590.47 B: and every every once in a while i might find a malamute 

590.73 594.01 B: like uh just you know walking around because it's so 

594.26 596.86 B: hard not to see 'em if they are out 

596.92 598.17 B: but uh 

598.37 599.89 B: yeah they're not too common
