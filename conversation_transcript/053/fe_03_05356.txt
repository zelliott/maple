27.37 28.65 A: mhm 

28.01 37.69 B: and uh what uh what's important to you for um the important thing in uh considering a life partner [noise] 

37.12 40.70 A: oh okay do you have a life partner [laughter] 

40.25 54.55 B: oh well [laughter] i've had a couple of life partners i'm with a partner now i certainly hope to be with i suppose for the rest of my life uh um [lipsmack] do and you do you have a life partner

59.05 60.82 B: and uh do you 

61.29 65.28 B: expect uh well what things uh about your wife uh 

65.47 67.59 B: did you think perhaps uh 

67.75 70.03 B: would make her a good life partner 

70.08 71.80 A: (( well it's a )) 

72.28 75.12 A: (( you know she's uh kinda )) 

75.35 77.25 A: always never you 

77.33 87.41 A: know thinking about herself she just tries to give me almost everything even like if we would have food or buying things you know anything 

87.42 99.23 A: she would rather like do it for me than do it for her and i don't know if you read the bible which it said you know there is more joy in giving than receiving 

99.49 107.07 A: so if you meet anybody like that than i am sure that would be probably a perfect life partner i would say 

107.36 108.53 B: (( well [laughter] )) 

107.48 114.31 A: that's about it for me what about yourself what do you think is the most important thing in that 

109.77 110.69 B: [laughter] 

113.96 127.49 B: well i uh i certainly agree with you that uh giving uh is a big part of it and uh to appreciate that when you're with someone that uh gives of themselves 

116.87 117.72 A: (( mm mm )) 

126.91 128.50 A: yeah 

127.74 129.25 B: and uh 

129.73 136.21 B: i i think people that that can work together uh and especially do you have a family 

135.99 137.23 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

136.90 141.42 B: oh well that's that's important too to be able to raise children 

141.03 142.21 A: oh yeah 

141.65 142.63 B: (( uh )) 

142.81 148.37 B: uh in a giving uh environment uh with your family and uh 

148.83 149.79 B: (( ah )) 

150.01 161.94 B: well do you uh do you are there other things that uh you appreciate i mean i- i'm sure she gives er her love and she takes care of you and your family 

151.18 151.99 A: (( mm )) 

160.11 172.35 A: oh y- yeah all of these that comes too with you know respect and e- e- everything and i got i would say you know nobody is perfect in any way 

172.52 179.09 A: but when you are in position that you can think about you know about we 

179.33 181.43 A: instead of i 

181.07 182.15 B: mhm 

181.52 182.52 A: that takes 

182.52 183.92 A: you know that takes a lot 

183.93 197.60 A: a lot of adjustment to do because i was you know single for the longest time and i didn't get married until i was in my thirties so that's kind of you see you already set a wall 

197.79 200.84 A: (( for yourself you know a standard for yourself )) 

200.54 201.58 B: yes 

200.98 208.70 A: then you have to come to merge that you know like you know try to put it together with somebody else's life 

208.81 213.69 A: which i think we did a good job because like i said uh 

214.12 229.04 A: the same way i said about sharing sharing it's like when you think about the other person first and then usually like when you do that the other person like if if that person he or she knows 

229.08 234.61 A: (( that she's gonna be taken care of by her partner or by his partner )) 

234.62 235.44 B: yes 

234.65 238.73 A: (( so that's when it's very easy to think about the other person )) 

239.18 247.06 A: and like i said respect is the you know usually you can agree to disagree you know like because 

247.09 256.60 A: you love somebody and you are with that person all the time you know that doesn't mean you have to agree with everything that person say you know or do 

256.46 266.69 A: but you can respect that and that's a good thing too in a relationship like you know you can always be yourself 

266.83 276.73 A: and then yet being you know together with somebody else and if you in a relationship and you cannot be yourself like 

276.69 284.42 A: every time and there is no trust or anything i think that's not th- you know that's not too good because if you know 

284.64 286.40 A: (( you are worthy )) 

286.98 301.77 A: of you know if you know you are worthy like your partner like you are trustworthy and you ah have something to offer and you're not selfish in any way you know i think the life partner and that's 

301.63 305.10 A: what i think everybody's looking for you know 

305.51 311.00 A: and that's what i was looking for too which i think you know i've found myself 

311.29 322.27 A: and things like that like i said everybody will have a different point of view of what to do or what to look for but i think myself i think that's the main 

322.42 324.79 A: that's the key point i would for 

324.67 327.47 A: [mn] in somebody and 

327.35 340.86 A: you were you looking for somebody directly or did you have a list or whatever what you were looking for or you just try to figure it out as you go what you think that would be the right 

341.94 352.01 B: [mn] [lipsmack] well i i agree with you wilson i think uh sharing and almost being one and having mutual respect for one another and still 

343.99 345.00 A: mhm 

348.23 348.91 A: (( mm )) 

350.75 351.80 A: yeah 

351.86 359.70 B: being able to sort of keep your individuality and understand and respect that in your partner 

355.39 356.40 A: (( mhm mm )) 

359.65 368.60 B: is is uh really important and to be able to enjoy and and uh work for things together perhaps that you er 

367.03 367.65 A: (( mm )) 

368.46 374.94 B: want to do or experience in life and to be able to share that with someone is really precious 

374.95 383.25 B: and worth er w- working towards if there are say some disagreements always keep in mind that uh 

375.04 375.67 A: (( mm )) 

382.49 383.18 A: (( mm mm )) 

384.14 391.27 B: that the that y- you're doing this together and it's uh sort of part of life's journey 

391.21 396.06 A: yeah um i like mhm you can continue yeah 

391.99 392.89 B: i would 

395.48 407.43 B: oh [laughter] okay uh yeah i was i was concerned about this this topic in the sense like the when they said life's partner whether it sort of implies or or 

396.60 397.63 A: mhm 

407.32 408.01 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

407.49 409.92 B: a a commitment to 

410.01 415.04 B: spend all er the rest of your life together or 

415.33 428.56 B: sometimes we have partners or we have relationships that er don't work out whether or not you still want to make the commitment you mentioned i i get the impression that uh 

428.69 429.71 B: (( ah )) 

430.07 439.78 B: ah the the the bible you [mn] and the bible probably suggests that er once one marries that you should stay married for life um 

433.18 434.25 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

438.95 447.72 A: uh well l- let me put it this way myself like i i have a different point of view on that 

447.28 448.31 B: mhm 

447.74 459.20 A: because [mn] we all know if you are in a situation you are miserable that you know needless to say you make the other person miserable right 

458.54 459.53 B: yes 

459.00 469.81 A: so because if you're married and there is you know no life no harmony no y- you know not all the keys that we say 

469.57 475.49 A: like w- like i said you know the person is not gonna be perfect so aren't we all 

475.25 476.23 B: mhm 

475.63 486.35 A: but the point is you know because you married that doesn't mean you have to stay for the rest of your life being miserable just to say the name that i've been married to only one person 

486.79 492.60 A: because [mn] as we always are you know we always hear that life is too short 

492.04 493.59 B: (( [laughter] yes [laughter] )) 

492.80 503.23 A: to kind of just waste your life and make somebody else's life miserable and if you don't have a good you know life because you wanna have a good life 

503.52 518.19 A: i- i am sure you can have a decent life you know by yourself but when you have somebody to share your life with that's make it you know very you know that should make it very good not perfect but at least better 

518.30 522.62 A: than what you had alone right wouldn't you suggest that 

521.87 525.12 B: (( [mn] [sigh] i i certainly agree i was gonna say it is )) 

523.64 534.25 A: yeah because god doesn't god say that because he knows like you know they give you someone their commitment if you'll like you know respect and all the things sharing and all this 

534.20 540.46 A: and i can bet you anytime you do this kind of things you share 

540.23 549.28 A: you respect you do everything try to put the other person first there is no marriage that can fail with that 

549.87 556.60 B: [lipsmack] sounds like you have a lot of wisdom and experience [laughter] [laughter] and and appreciation 

550.26 551.27 A: yes it 

552.80 556.30 A: ah oh oh well living as if you [mn] 

556.17 561.64 A: yeah if you stay out as long as i was being single and you know 

561.40 571.90 A: it's not like you know you didn't meet people but everybody's trying like if you want to try it while you're married you said me me me me me you know like 

572.57 585.79 A: you know it's always good to think i i don't think you know thinking about like two people would be so good because i've been doing my i i's so long and i was always in charge 

586.01 599.95 A: but then i realised that things you know we all know our limits and you know we all know what to do and you don't think it you know anyway that i i would say that i have some wisdom and i learned that
