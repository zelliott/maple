0.75 2.34 B: hi my name's dave 

1.94 4.37 A: hi dave how're you doing mine's fred 

5.30 7.56 B: (( ah i'm pretty good how're you doing )) 

6.98 11.80 A: oh i'm all right oh too we're talking about the minimum wage 

11.64 12.88 B: yeah 

12.87 20.70 A: okay let's see what do you ah think of the minimum wage do you think of the minimum wage do you think ah five fifteen's enough or do you think it should be raised to ten 

21.73 28.95 B: five fifteen i thought the minimum wage is up around like six something i'm in massachussetts now it's like six seventy five around here now 

26.42 27.28 A: uh-huh 

28.49 33.32 A: oh well you see um federal ah minimum wage 

33.59 36.13 A: is um five fifteen 

36.35 37.36 B: oh 

36.45 40.83 A: and i understand and from what i understand the state's can 

37.68 38.39 B: i've 

40.96 44.52 A: um regulate how much they want to 

44.84 46.60 A: provide the 

47.26 48.20 A: um 

48.96 51.23 A: [mn] extra for the 

51.36 57.79 A: ah minimum wage for example um down here in north carolina ah the minimum wage is five fifteen 

58.29 59.48 B: oh okay 

58.89 62.79 A: which is the federally mandated bare bones minimum all 

64.25 75.43 B: yeah that's that's really low like i'm nineteen years old and like most of the jobs that i've had have been minimum wage and i've kind of been appreciated appreciated like the like five or six dollars that i was getting like 

69.60 70.66 A: right 

74.75 76.04 A: mhm 

75.59 83.67 B: i don't know i think that it should be like higher because the cost of living's going up so much especially around here i think that's why our minimum wage is so high 

83.34 93.89 A: oh incred- ah i mean it it it's you know um the ah rate of inflation's high everywhere i mean yeah the bank inflation's low but your cost of living is still 

94.28 95.65 A: um rising 

96.27 97.24 B: yes 

98.77 102.07 B: so i think it would be a good move if they moved it up to ten dollars 

102.05 103.00 A: (( i mean )) 

102.13 105.31 B: i mean that's a lot for like an employer but um 

104.28 112.01 A: y- yeah it would be a lot for an employer but it'd be more realistic ah you know it for today's society i mean 

108.97 109.81 B: yes 

112.14 120.94 A: you figure your average um apart- you know apartment alone in a rural area is about four fifty 

120.74 121.68 B: really 

121.98 127.51 A: ah well i know i know that in the um small town down here in north carolina i'm in 

122.04 122.97 B: wow 

123.06 124.06 B: [laughter] 

127.70 133.26 A: an apartment ah is four twenty five 

133.59 141.23 A: and i was following around to other small towns the other day and ah they were like four fifty for renting an apartment 

141.36 149.67 B: yeah i am it's up around like ah the average is around like eight or nine hundred dollars a month 'cause it's right like right next to boston 

146.99 148.15 A: exactly 

149.14 153.05 A: oh well yeah i mean you know you can't afford to live on a minimum wage job 

153.04 154.12 B: oh yes 

153.72 156.12 A: and that's the thing i mean um 

156.13 160.65 A: you've got a lot of people whether they're in between real jobs or 

161.15 167.30 A: um what have you that obviously would benefit from a higher minimum wage 

168.32 169.83 B: exactly [laughter] 

170.20 177.49 B: because it it really is unrealistic to have like a lower minimum like a s- ah it's around seven dollars an hour but even at seven dollars 

176.70 180.30 A: even at seven dollars that's really not enough to live on 'cause 

180.35 188.76 B: yeah i was i was working at a forty hour a week for my job at a ah plumbing suppliers for seven dollars an hour and i worked like all week all day every day 

180.67 181.28 A: (( it )) 

185.54 186.28 A: mhm 

188.70 196.65 B: and then i'd only bring home like around two hundred thirty dollars a week which is like almost nothing and i made like no money for myself i just covered my bills 

191.88 192.87 A: uh-huh 

195.91 199.14 A: heck yeah m- m- i would say that barely covered your bills 

199.70 207.19 A: at that amount and just you know on the basis of ah you know in reality i mean 

207.90 213.55 A: if everything were if minimum were ten dollars an hour yeah it might hurt small businesses a little 

213.72 216.17 A: who had a lot of employees 

216.48 218.22 A: but your big companies 

218.28 221.87 A: i don't think they'd really see that much of a difference 

222.20 224.25 A: i mean they may have 

222.47 225.21 B: yeah i don't think it would affect them at all [laughter] 

224.59 227.56 A: well i mean they your big companies may have to um 

228.03 230.81 A: you know ah drop um 

231.21 233.11 A: you know some of their extra spending 

234.24 238.14 A: you know cut some of the fat a little bit but i mean in reality it would probably be 

238.16 240.45 A: i mean it'd be better for your average american 

240.73 249.50 B: yes but do you think ah the ah increase in the minimum wage would like boost the price of everything that we have to buy like all the finished products that all these businesses make 

248.29 250.86 A: a- a- well it depends it depends 

250.88 258.28 A: ah considering that the majority of the finished products that we buy today are made overseas 

258.62 260.33 B: yes that's true 

260.68 262.15 A: i mean ah 

262.61 266.31 A: you know what are they going to do raise the price of a hamburger up higher 

267.70 275.18 B: exactly there's not much that's produced in america like we have lots of imports and like not that many exports 

273.40 274.33 A: well 

274.51 279.05 A: we've become a um service industry or service um 

279.60 280.84 A: society 

280.85 287.05 A: and you know whether we serve ah technology we serve food or entertainment or what have you 

280.87 281.96 B: (( yes [noise] )) 

287.45 290.85 A: ah we still in i mean we're just as a whole 

291.22 299.29 A: [mn] a service society we aren't into manufacturing anymore so the price of minimum wage increasing really wouldn't matter ah 

300.28 304.56 B: yeah not as much as it would like maybe like twenty years ago or so 

303.85 306.77 A: twenty years ago it would have made a big difference 

307.04 312.26 A: but in ah right now it probably wouldn't i mean it could just be passed on to the other 

313.16 315.24 A: ah you know on down the chain i mean 

315.50 321.85 A: your say your average fortune five hundred company probably only has 

321.76 322.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

323.34 325.62 A: say if they're employing 

324.35 325.65 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

326.46 332.63 A: five hundred thousand workers you say a fifth of those are your minimum wage workers 

332.37 333.60 B: mhm 

333.18 339.17 A: okay and you figure if you spread that out over the millions that these companies make 

339.41 341.75 A: you figure that they're not losing that much 

342.05 345.74 B: yeah not that much at all to draw like one fifth of the labor force 

345.42 354.30 A: all right and you figure most of the major ah ah the most [mn] excuse me most of the money they pay out is for their higher executives 

354.26 355.27 B: (( [mn] yes )) 

355.07 362.28 A: i mean if their higher executives took a pay cut and they ah that would pretty much solve your ah 

362.64 367.02 A: being able to pay the minimum ah wage worker ten bucks an hour 

366.99 377.80 B: [mn] [laughter] yeah it would kind of spread the wealth out a little better 'cause on division and something like the lowest employee in a company to the highest the amount of money difference per year is just astronomical 

369.59 370.67 A: yeah 

373.73 374.62 A: mhm 

377.21 384.62 A: oh no kidding i mean you look at um you know before enron came you look at how much their um c._e._o.'s were making 

379.77 380.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

384.85 386.55 B: yeah [laughter] 

385.95 389.30 A: as compared to their average little data entry person 

390.77 395.95 A: you know who's probably only making you know seven eight bucks an hour 

397.65 398.75 A: are you there 

398.94 399.75 B: yeah 

399.40 402.93 A: okay it just got really quiet and i thought i'd lost you there or something 

402.94 404.40 A: (( ah do you agree )) 

404.63 407.14 B: ah yeah i agree with you completely 

407.69 414.73 B: like it would definitely benefit everyone like the general working force like the blue collar people in america 

411.85 413.09 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

414.08 415.99 A: yeah well even 

415.00 418.05 B: and that's the majority that would speak and would vote on it 

416.73 421.69 A: oh yeah exactly i mean even your lower um income white collar workers 

421.86 422.77 B: yes 

422.55 426.81 A: oh you know 'cause i mean you figure that um 

427.46 435.88 A: it your lower income white collar worker's salary is based at least in part by the minimum minimum wage 

436.14 439.46 A: and you know you figure if the minimum wage is ten bucks an hour 

439.91 447.07 A: ah the person that's previously working for twelve bucks an hour would probably be increased to something like twenty two or something 

447.31 451.19 B: yeah 'cause they'd have to have some sort of division between it 

450.24 453.67 A: right which would you know equal things out a little 

453.82 455.58 B: yeah 

454.68 457.97 A: a general offer you know everybody to have a um 

459.06 465.14 A: you know easier time with it i mean yeah prices may rise a little but prices are going to rise a little anyway 

465.56 467.33 B: (( yeah )) 

466.76 468.71 A: and you should at least ah 

469.32 471.83 A: be given the opportunity to 

473.27 476.53 A: [mn] ah you know try to earn a decent living 

476.87 481.66 B: yeah same to reduce the ah spending like of the ah general consumer 

481.00 482.64 A: oh no kidding 

482.07 486.00 B: like it would boost productivity to get us out of the economic slump we're in 

485.41 487.87 A: oh exactly i mean um 

488.16 491.43 A: you figure how much we pay out in um 

491.65 498.77 A: [mn] in entitlements you know social security welfare etcetera um you know we're paying so much out into those i mean 

495.44 496.37 B: (( yeah )) 

498.95 501.40 A: you and i are never going to see social security 

501.68 503.75 B: yeah it's definitely going to be gone 

502.16 505.01 A: you you're nineteen i'm twenty seven we're never going to see it 

505.67 508.14 A: we will never see social security 

508.61 515.16 B: yeah it was a good discuss that but now there's too many people to have a successful like social security fund 

509.14 510.02 A: and 

514.42 515.63 A: exactly 

515.45 517.38 B: well the way it's set up right now i think 

515.77 518.43 A: well people are living longer now 

518.68 522.42 A: i mean ah when social security was set up back in the sixties 

518.84 519.71 B: yes 

522.56 523.49 A: um 

523.60 526.15 A: your average life expectancy 

526.95 531.10 A: or actually social security was excuse me social security was set up in the um thirties 

531.06 535.31 A: ah but it was really brought out during ah johnson's um plan 

535.26 549.55 A: of ah his great society plan anyway um don't mind me i'm a history teacher so [laughter] i tend to go into history um type things anyway um we ended ah um costing ourselves much more 

539.65 541.59 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

549.76 553.97 A: and of course now that all your um baby boomers are retiring 

554.00 555.17 B: (( yeah )) 

554.56 557.83 A: you know there's no way they're going to want to cut it 

557.90 559.39 A: 'cause they benefit from it 

559.80 569.20 B: yeah they wouldn't they definitely wouldn't want to cut the benefits from it but if they didn't then there would be no social security left for any of us we're paying their social security right now 

566.61 569.06 A: well the there probably won't be 

569.14 570.67 A: in reality 

571.06 576.14 A: there won't be 'cause ah you figure they're talking about adding um 

571.39 572.20 B: (( yeah )) 

577.10 582.08 A: [mn] prescription benefits to it and um i agree we do need to take care of our old people 

582.58 585.90 A: ah but at the same time it shouldn't be at the cost of 

586.00 587.72 A: your um the 

587.07 588.73 B: the general populace 

588.07 589.52 A: general populace 

590.06 594.37 A: ah i mean there should be a balancing there which is why if you raise the minimum wage 

594.71 597.40 A: and you know you cut some of this extra spending 

598.15 599.89 A: and um you know you didn't cut it f-
