219.98 221.54 B: mhm it's easier 

222.05 227.04 B: now mine was walled in too and i could just leave it outside it could run and have fun and just lay on the porch 

225.75 227.91 A: that's the problem 

227.16 235.67 B: but in an apartment you have to keep a dog ah you have to take it out three or four times a day and and and i don't believe in abusing an animal i wanna give it all the attention i can 

231.22 232.39 A: you have to 

235.10 236.58 A: (( that's right )) 

235.98 241.27 B: and uh spend some time with the frisbee and or exercise and it helps me too you know i mean it keeps you walking and going 

239.38 240.63 A: yeah 

241.30 248.29 B: and uh in my son was in new york when his g- girlfriend went to columbia university they kept a dog up there but it the dog wasn't as happy there

248.67 249.65 B: no 

256.49 257.82 B: mhm 

259.39 261.54 B: mhm mhm 

260.30 265.38 A: and see that's the thing my wife she really wants a g- dog and she don't want a big dog 'cause she 

264.55 269.39 B: some kind of little lapdog might be all right like one that sits on your lap or that's not too big 

267.70 268.91 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

269.37 281.68 B: and that that sometimes works better in an apartment and of course a your consultants will tell you what kind of dog to get for that you know like a papillon or some one of those kind that are very intelligent and but i don't one too small 'cause i don't wanna step on it or hurt it 

276.26 277.81 A: yeah
