45.54 46.10 A: [mn] 

46.14 50.68 A: yeah it's definitely not the days for the knicks nowadays [mn] need 

49.38 52.60 B: no i look at er- i give the knicks maybe 

52.93 55.74 B: maybe another six years they might be 

55.79 60.28 B: you know knocking at the door or getting to past the second round in the playoffs 

60.39 62.94 A: to get some good draft horses 

62.41 64.16 B: yeah they need a real center 

65.61 75.18 A: uh they had one that's what made 'em so good there for a few years but they just haven't they were good during the same years michael jordan was good patrick ewing [mn] 

72.50 73.72 B: yeah 

74.52 78.73 B: but the bad thing about the knicks they always have a player 

79.10 86.28 B: and they don't surround them with the right supporting cast so he winds up burning himself out or getting injured which is always the case 

84.64 85.82 A: absolutely 

86.57 88.57 A: absolutely 

87.77 89.86 B: so what do you think about the um 

90.48 95.90 B: the the college football trade that they was trying to take a couple of the big east teams 

96.26 101.61 A: well i'm i'm a south carolina fan you ever see south carolina [mn] 

101.11 102.08 B: (( mm )) 

101.69 106.09 A: so getting me more chances to watch clemson lose so it can't be that bad 

105.24 106.81 B: [laughter] 

106.91 115.22 B: okay well actu- i mean my father lives in north carolina and he's a big washing- he loves washington and he loves the lakers

116.17 118.66 A: [mn] i don't know i don't know how much 

120.00 125.05 A: big east is going to be totally destroyed if they lose diami and those three 

124.84 126.23 B: yeah 

126.13 128.59 A: won't be a conference any more 

127.86 130.52 B: yes 'cause those are the powerhouse teams 

129.91 135.59 A: right you mi- miami which is their biggest strength in football and then you got uh 

135.60 137.58 A: syracuse and b._c. 

137.27 138.67 B: (( mhm )) 

138.52 143.45 A: well no way we no one would accuse them of being the north carolina or du- during their heyday 

143.54 144.65 B: mhm 

143.65 147.61 A: but still it's the basketball powers in that conference 

147.17 147.96 B: (( yes )) 

149.20 153.29 B: 'cause i- the only difference is like all the other schools they're basically 

153.62 160.72 B: yeah they're basically all into basketball not too much i mean they got decent football teams but you know nothing to write home about [mn] 

160.03 161.53 A: [mn] i mean you're sitting on 

162.73 172.44 A: they're about to kick isn't it is it the big east that's about to kick out temple 'cause they just can't play football they're just lit- is that is that the team i'm thinking of 

172.00 179.19 B: i don't it's not the fact that they want to kick them they might kick temple out 'cause temple temple basketball 

178.57 180.96 A: right and they're just 

180.24 183.51 B: since john chainey left i mean temple's just mediocre

195.99 197.81 B: well well th- 

196.21 200.48 A: don- don't see a whole lot of it so we can't follow it too well

201.22 206.06 A: yeah it gets it gets lousy ratings kind nationwide and they're even worse down here [laughter] 

205.77 207.69 B: [laughter] 

207.87 208.56 B: mm 

208.72 213.35 A: but then you look at who we have the thrashers come on [laughter] yeah i 

211.77 213.26 B: oh well yeah 

214.21 217.70 B: well we you know we we're playing a little sport up here because

236.10 237.05 A: and they're 

236.22 236.78 B: (( [mn] )) 

237.12 245.88 B: and you always got one good player and the rest are the rest or basically i i would kinda look at it sometimes it's the coach because the coach 

245.80 252.37 B: assembles these players and i look at what he puts on the floor and then like they'll never make it 

252.50 255.42 A: coach and the g. m. 

254.39 259.44 B: yeah and the biggest problem the knicks have is when they gave houston

382.47 385.37 A: (( need )) 

384.68 396.14 B: there problem is they didn't they should of gave him a tumble more playing time you know they should of put him in like every series they should of had him play like two games so he can get his rhythm back together 

390.12 392.98 A: (( yeah )) 

396.64 398.75 A: [noise] who's got the cap for him 

398.70 399.78 B: (( [mn] mm )) 

399.28 400.59 A: (( [mn] ))

416.94 419.17 B: you know he'll take little to nothing 

419.62 421.82 A: he could but would he 

422.82 432.42 A: 'cause he's always been this guy who would rather you not get pa- would rather not get paid at all than get paid what they don't s- a somewhat of a little fraction what they think they're worth 

431.44 433.35 B: (( hm )) 

433.21 434.34 A: (( as i said [noise] )) 

433.49 443.43 B: maybe i i and it kinda kinda messed me up when um they traded back [mn] new jersey and philly i didn't understand that 

444.76 445.47 A: (( no )) 

445.59 451.39 A: that's why i sometimes i don't even waste my time understanding i just do not get all these trades and 

450.33 459.26 B: i'm like i don't i don't understand i think okay you had him and now you're trading him back for the other guy you traded him for and i i i don't know man [laughter] 

457.47 462.14 A: yeah sounds like two g._m.s regret their decisions 

461.39 466.06 B: yeah but now you regret even more even more 

465.99 467.23 A: (( [laughter] )) 

467.39 472.84 A: yeah how you get good at the n._b._a. is you develop your talent you don't draft 'em and trade 'em away 

473.69 475.40 B: i don't i don't either [laughter] 

474.14 476.09 A: or anything i me- 

475.50 480.15 B: that's it well i mean knick- that's a knicks problem they i like to sleep on um picks 

480.85 483.36 A: yeah look at 

484.00 486.91 A: look at the wizards now they've lost all their talent and no 

486.99 489.58 A: i've heard they're looking to trade kwame brown 

489.63 490.48 B: (( [mn] )) 

490.56 495.44 A: [mn] they get one decent draft pick they can use it on him and now they want to get rid of him 

494.41 500.19 B: and you can't trade him i mean 'cause if you try if you're trying to go you know 

496.95 498.29 A: [mn] you'd always 

500.14 510.25 B: with a little more experience then just say give up s- give up two other players and get you know get that experienced player but don't give him away that's ya that's your whole draw right now 

509.65 513.93 A: [noise] right you're way to you're way to win is to develop you're talent 

514.43 518.71 A: look at what chicago did they were not good the first few years they had michael jordan 

518.46 521.81 B: no and then they finally said well look 

521.88 530.41 B: this man's going in going out every night busting his arse let's try and get some people around him you know so he doesn't have to work as hard 

531.32 533.02 A: [mn] scotty pippin 

533.31 538.44 A: well he's you don't hear much about him anymore unless you happen to live in 

535.92 537.46 B: (( no he's gone )) 

539.69 550.92 B: [laughter] his his problem is um he you know right after mike left they gave him the reins to the team and he never developed into a leader 

549.20 553.85 A: (( portland [laughter] [mn] yeah )) 

552.25 558.86 B: never don't develop into a leader he i don't know i guess he had to be he always had to be pulled pulled along

573.14 585.34 B: but yeah he you know he had his he um he had nice skills and stuff he just want a leader he was always i guess he was like a coach's player where you could say look scotty i need you to do this and he'd do 

585.82 587.32 A: (( [noise] right )) 

586.37 589.42 B: it but to just to go out and do it on his own he wouldn't 

590.24 592.94 A: he's not he's not your driving force 

592.70 593.85 B: (( no mhm )) 

594.64 595.56 B: (( he )) 

595.65 598.26 B: right after right after the trade off okay
