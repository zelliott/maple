66.10 69.57 A: (( definitely )) 

74.45 87.03 A: oh that's cool that's cool um yeah i'd say that you can either have uh you can either be completely opposite of each other you could be you know have all the same interests or something like that 

85.02 92.79 B: well like you said honest are you uh er it don't take long to figure out if you're if you lie one way or another it comes back on you quick and it's [mn]

101.13 114.26 B: i don't know the the same interests and stuff that's really i don't know you know like i say it's not really i wouldn't say it's on my top list of importance but you know it it helps i mean it makes things you know don't want to take somebody who's just totally opposite to you you wouldn't probably be together in the first place i don't reckon 

114.09 123.67 A: that's true that's true you've gotta have some kind of common bond where you know you uh at least meet you know whether it be a bar or you know class or 

123.76 126.02 A: work or something like that 

124.89 126.08 B: (( yeah it's )) 

126.11 128.55 B: er what what would you say when uh like if uh 

128.46 134.22 B: if you worked around say whoever you was with you was married or something like that and you worked around your wife or your girlfriend all day long i mean that would 

134.04 144.89 B: some people think that would be like [noise] you know that'd be horrible 'cause you'd be you'd get tired of each other whatever i think it'd be pretty cool i mean i like if you're with 'em or not with 'em i mean if you get along good at home you're gonna get along good anywhere 

136.79 137.55 A: (( you'd )) 

144.23 146.37 A: right yeah i think so too 

146.40 150.61 A: um i don't know if i could really handle working side by side all day long and 

149.33 155.14 B: no that would probably i know what they mean by that that would probably you wouldn't wanna be right there that would get old after a while bro 

154.46 164.03 A: right some people can do it though you know i don't know what it takes to really be that close and not get on each other's nerves after that long but it's gotta be something 

162.52 163.34 B: uh 

163.99 168.29 B: i know i know what you mean there i stay well actually i work out most of all the time and she's 

168.42 177.43 B: (( [mn] you all get back in there i ain't a talking to you in here get out of here i'm running a house full of women out here get back in there this is i'm new to this and they all make me all blush to death )) 

172.71 175.10 A: [laughter] 

176.68 178.30 A: (( that's right )) 

177.59 181.27 B: but uh [mn] well see you see we get along good she didn't punch me 

181.12 187.33 A: [laughter] 

181.46 194.61 B: uh uh we're doing pretty good there but um i'll i don't know y- uh you hit it on the head when you said the first thing you gotta be honest with 'em 'cause that what they're ju- you well you can't build nothing else of it it if don't everything else is just [mn] like quick 

188.86 193.51 A: yeah 

194.62 209.28 A: yeah i'd agree with that it's just one of those it's one of those things that you know you can go back to communication or having things in common or whatever but it all doesn't matter if you can't trust a person to tell me the truth 

205.91 215.20 B: sand yeah you don't even have to bake 'em the same i mean different countries anyway that don't matter me 'cause people you know people that live in the same country don't get along and the same town don't get along so 

214.51 215.84 A: that's true 

215.24 220.57 B: and it's it's the same with me and women i guess that [mn] our race is i reckon 'bout the same on there 

220.58 221.49 B: but uh 

221.88 231.34 B: it's we do pretty good it's you know like i say you gotta have trust and you gotta be honest with them [mn] and [mn] don't need to hold stuff in either um um sorta found that out from me own experience 

231.07 231.87 A: mhm 

231.35 239.72 B: it don't really doing no good but if you get it on out there don't matter how bad it is when you get it out there [mn] it's gonna be ten times worse if you hold it in for a couple of days 

239.10 249.12 A: y- yeah it's uh it's definitely true some some people say that it's easier to uh ask for uh ask forgiveness than it is permission but uh 

249.03 252.69 B: (( well yeah )) 

249.05 255.33 A: you know i think if you're if you're up front with what's going on then it makes it a lot easier to uh 

254.19 259.88 B: everybody these does crazy stuff and does stuff [mn] you know i'm pretty sure that they regret right at the minute they do it but then again 

259.70 267.11 B: if you just just get it out in the open get it over with and the air clears quick it don't take everything is just seems like it boils over a lot easier but 

266.58 268.41 A: right 

267.05 277.37 B: we've never really had a arg- i was gonna say we've been two years we've never really had no problems we've never had y- you know like everybody has their spats well i can honestly say you know we don't because it's just it's [mn] 

276.31 282.66 A: mhm right that's a good way to be 

277.66 283.82 B: she just tells me like it is and that's what it is [laughter] so i just agree and go on just agree and go on 

283.53 286.08 A: (( right )) 

284.12 285.37 B: uh but uh 

285.48 291.55 B: [mn] i don't know you don't know right now people going together now in relationships from what i've seen as far as around in here like in virginia where i'm at it's just 

291.87 303.80 B: um i got her just th- there aint no such thing as one is serious anymore people do one person one day and one the next and you might they might be going together for a couple of days and or a week and and it's the same thing that we're talking about everybody i don't know 

299.07 301.37 A: mhm 

303.96 312.05 B: i'm i'm satisfied with going to work and coming home i mean that that sounds boring but it's not if you know what i mean there's nothing boring about it but everybody else thinks god it's boring 

308.00 310.30 A: right 

312.08 324.87 B: but uh we get along great and i know i see everybody all my friends and marriage's [mn] seems like everyone of them a hundred percent of them are just arguing and miserable and they're all you know sleeping around and doing stink stuff and i i just 

323.51 325.64 A: mhm 

325.17 330.48 B: really get into it myself but that's if that's what they wanna do it's [mn] they have to answer for it not me 

330.15 331.40 A: right 

330.52 334.78 B: (( not miserable but uh [mn] among others no trust in they don't have a relationship )) 

334.50 345.45 A: right that's that's too bad too i mean you know i'm single and i'm happy being single and i figure you know if love or whatever comes along then twenty three yeah [laughter] yeah i'm not i'm i'll be forty one in october and yet i was lucky yet i've i've lived with this lady here for 

342.64 344.07 B: (( oh how old are you uh )) 

344.55 346.80 B: (( oh okay oh god lord of mercy here )) 

346.38 348.65 A: (( two years but i was i i was i was )) 

346.86 350.52 B: (( [laughter] [mn] what year of the lord you ain't in no hurry take it easy )) 

349.98 351.29 A: (( single and i loved )) 

352.60 358.95 B: (( i'll be i'm for- i don't we're not married now )) 

357.19 358.10 A: (( it mhm )) 

358.71 361.11 A: (( right mhm )) 

358.78 371.97 B: but uh that that's cool i mean everybody goes you know it's [mn] oh it's gotta horrible no it's not it's the best thing in the world and i mean it's just i loved it but i love the way things are now and and things are really no different it's just to have somebody like i say we got about the same 

364.54 365.41 A: (( mm )) 

371.79 377.31 B: we do a lot of things the same but there's a lot of things we do totally different and that and that is sort of cool all the time too 

377.57 378.58 B: but uh 

378.01 381.86 A: mhm 

379.43 389.35 B: [noise] if you are there i keep saying that over and over but that trust deal that that's the main thing i'd say in that question they give us you gotta have that and the trades and stuff because if you don't it's just [noise] 

385.31 386.96 A: (( [mn] [mn] definitely )) 

389.14 397.77 B: you just you just not gonna make it [laughter] it's just dead i don't lie everyb- i can i can't judge it for myself 'cause we're doing great but like i say out of my friends i'd say [mn] they're just 

397.82 407.97 B: miserable seems like all of them are just it seemed like they rushed into something they're they they just i don't never go out with one one night and two or three days later they wanna be married or something and i don't know what the problem is 

406.04 415.53 A: mhm yeah people [mn] [mn] it's what i i think it's called serial monogamy they go from one to the other to the other to the other and 

410.16 413.12 B: yeah yes i 

414.18 416.49 B: never heard yeah that's a good word for it 

415.80 417.68 A: right 

416.63 417.54 B: but uh 

417.67 428.20 B: and then wonder why they're miserable they're just [mn] why can't [mn] you know what [mn] i can't trust her i can't trust her well mate you know or i can't trust him well look in the mirror there's probably a good reason for it i mean it's gotta be both ways 

419.24 421.33 A: right 

427.66 437.64 A: you know it does it takes two to tango when it comes to stuff like that and sometimes people have to look at themselves and wonder you know what the what's going on with me that you know this didn't work as well you know 

428.17 432.95 B: (( yeah )) 

436.34 442.91 B: quit asking what's asking what's wrong with them and start asking the other thing you know was it all of my doing here i may be doing something wrong here 

439.52 441.17 A: right 

443.22 444.59 A: (( [noise] right right )) 

443.63 444.62 B: but uh 

444.75 453.65 A: you know i mean you can [noise] y- with relationships it's i think it's kind of funny 'cause i've been in a couple and you know but some of them have been really serious and some of them have just been you know kind of flings or whatever 

445.49 454.67 B: yeah just 

453.54 461.02 A: and you know it's y- y- you make it what you want and you learn from it what you want 

457.49 458.08 B: (( [mn] )) 

458.15 466.31 B: [noise] well you got a good head on your shoulders you've learnt you've learnt early it took me about thirty y- well let's see i'm forty now hm about thirty eight years before i learned that [mn] 

465.38 470.96 A: i've i've tried you know i i'm one of those people that grew up early and i i watched instead of talked so 

468.83 471.90 B: oh yeah i heard that 

471.30 473.22 A: you know and i guess 

472.28 474.36 B: and it's probably served you good i'd say 

474.81 485.78 A: i think that's another another thing i'd want in a life partner is somebody who really looks around at life and asks questions rather than dictating how things are gonna be and has their mind made up already 

484.97 492.19 B: well yeah because really there aint nothing set i mean as far as that goes things change with every you know every gust of wind blows by something's changing different 

491.80 493.39 A: right 

492.26 493.29 B: but uh 

493.78 497.56 B: [mn] that's that's that's what's good about it though in some ways that's pretty cool too 

497.75 498.70 B: but uh 

498.72 500.04 B: (( but you know [mn] )) 

500.64 506.19 B: i was ju- both i was happy the other way you know like i say like you are now that's that's cool too there's nothing wrong with 

501.66 505.12 A: (( mhm )) 

506.41 507.60 A: definitely 

506.87 509.29 B: that window shopping that's pretty cool 

507.72 516.95 A: def- right you know and just you know not even that it's like i figured [mn] love's gonna find me a life partner or whatever it's gonna come to me yeah 

513.91 520.95 B: (( it's gonna happen i mean you you might look for it in your whole life you might not never find a woman you might just go to the store to get a loaf of bread and bump in i mean you know )) 

520.87 532.05 B: that's pretty cool too but i like that about it but what i liked about you know when i was single like i didn't you had to be home at no certain time and and what i truly like it now this the thing of it is you know it gives you a good feeling too to know that uh 

531.95 541.11 B: you know you pick up the phone and call and say and say you know and and somebody you know somebody's on the other end that really cares really you know not just going okay well just get here when you come or whatever i 

540.96 551.04 B: like i go back to my friends all of them seems like they're like that it's just like they're always so miserable and o- obviously it just and it don't have to be like that at all i mean it can be great and it is but they just 

550.95 563.17 B: i don't know they ain't jealous or nothing but they look at me and they go well why aren't you all arguing why aren't you just why aren't you all biting your heads and like what's the matter with that w- why should we be i mean there's no blueprint that says you have to you know we get along good and [mn] 

557.56 558.92 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh man ))

562.99 573.23 B: she goes and does her thing if she wants to that's cool and i'm all for it and she wants me to do the same i don't if i don't wanna be with nobody you can't trust anyway and i'm sure you feel the same way there if you can't trust 'em you don't wanna be with 

566.11 568.19 A: yeah 

572.83 582.89 A: yeah and you know i want [noise] i want whoever i'm with to be able to have the freedom to go out and do what they want and not worry about you know oh well is she gonna approve or that or you know or 

581.88 596.58 B: them yeah i'm lucky there well just because you see i do i mean as is natural i flirt but you just gotta as you put the ring on is it like a homing device you can't go you don't have no friends you gotta stay home i i i don't personally i don't believe it's like that
