39.58 45.91 A: [laughter] well i was just going to ask you you know married thirty three years i was gonna say what what is uh the important thing to look for in a life partner [noise] 

45.26 47.62 B: [mn] important thing to look for in a life partner 

47.96 51.14 B: is um selflessness 

51.27 52.60 B: [laughter] 

52.90 55.97 B: some er most people have in my opinion 

56.24 64.99 B: you know are are either self centered money cen- centered or material- materially centered things centered or god centered the latter's pretty rare [sigh] 

62.41 63.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

65.12 77.44 B: and uh those people who are selfless i think generally can make it in a in a in a marriage if they have if they're complementary and and some- somewhat similar in in in many ways uh 

77.82 86.54 B: i think that's important [mn] um do if you define what love is it's pretty hard to do but i you know i can love somebody at a d- distance 

86.70 91.29 B: i don't have to touch them even i mean but through time when all that stuff wears away 

91.36 101.10 B: [mn] you if you be- [noise] if you are s- i think if you really find true love it's rare some people might take twenty thirty forty years before it happens 

101.28 104.74 B: [mn] and um if you look at that person you say 

105.24 108.24 B: oh to yourself what can i do for that person 

109.35 111.84 B: [mn] spiritually mentally physically what can i do 

111.73 113.05 A: mhm 

112.40 126.16 B: [mn] rather than just where are we going what are we going to do how can we indulge ourselves uh because after you raise your family [mn] which really brings to mind which really i think is a nice way to learn how to f- expand your mind beyond yourself [sigh] 

126.52 135.96 B: uh if if you're lucky enough to or or if you don't have children and other there're other ways to do that [mn] you know social service things like uh i i think um 

137.09 139.11 B: that's the graduate level 

140.87 141.68 B: (( you know sh- )) 

141.47 142.89 A: for relationships 

142.53 153.63 B: yeah in any relationship really [sigh] through time and then many people never find it [lipsmack] i think [lipsmack] i think it's rare to find um that that element of 

153.94 156.90 B: that uh s- higher spiritual kind of love you know 

156.96 159.43 B: [lipsmack] but that's my theory 

159.40 161.35 B: not saying i know everything i don't 

161.31 167.73 B: my philosophy is i know nothing [laughter] but that that's my opinion and um [mn] 

167.68 178.27 B: uh you have you know rocky times and uh s- be able to slug through it rather than just throw up your hands and say well that's it 'cause we live in a comfort loving society that 

178.68 180.37 B: (( [sigh] pretty much )) 

182.47 185.08 B: uh tu- teaches us that you know 

185.60 188.53 B: oh if it doesn't please you or if it doesn't meet your needs 

188.59 190.61 A: [laughter] discard it and start over 

188.70 189.76 B: me nee- 

190.14 192.55 B: yeah throw it aw- it's g- let's go find another one 

192.75 201.20 B: [mn] so that's why the high divorce rate and [lipsmack] and that kind of stuff and peop- you know and of course you know it- it's softer to live here than 

201.42 206.73 B: other countries and we don't have arranged marriages we we can get married for passion 

206.38 207.41 A: mhm 

206.79 210.35 B: there are other relationships you know gay relationships uh 

210.51 216.13 B: er [mn] and i often wonder what it's going to be like in the future you know how we will how will we evolve 

216.33 219.17 B: as uh human beings what will happen 

219.25 221.31 B: and thousands of years in the future 

222.34 223.19 B: (( [mn] will )) 

223.84 225.68 B: will um we be more 

226.32 227.53 B: or less uh 

227.76 229.84 B: concerned with the things we're concerned with now 

230.67 233.63 A: i mean i i i think that's interesting the way 

233.81 238.24 A: you know you there's a disposable economy all of a sudden it has a parallel 

237.72 239.03 B: mhm 

238.40 243.90 A: in relationships the fact that you know back when you know as you say the thirties even 

243.63 244.98 B: (( [noise] right )) 

244.11 248.64 A: you know when you had to save everything well relationships last because it was so much harder to start over 

248.70 251.37 B: yes you had you had to survive 

249.62 250.32 A: (( you kn- )) 

250.95 256.06 A: right you know people weren't sitting there and saying oh well i don't need this i'll move on 

251.60 252.49 B: yeah 

253.35 254.57 B: mhm 

255.80 257.91 B: mhm mhm 

257.31 261.01 A: and it's almost like that's what it is i don't need this i don't have to put up with this 

259.21 260.14 B: mhm 

260.39 274.42 B: mhm well lot of it lot of it was uh you know paternalistic [mn] you know and it was uh male dominated not a lot of women endured a lot of abuse let's face it [mn] but uh you know yeah but i think we've gone the other direction i think the pendulum's gone completely the other direction 

274.85 276.22 B: and um 

276.60 282.86 B: uh even though we're more aware and people sh- i think do share more the l- the people less traditional in their roles even though [sigh] 

283.26 287.93 B: even though i find you know when i was married i think i i changed like one diaper 

288.09 290.15 A: [laughter] 

288.79 302.06 B: which i'm not proud to say but you know i look at guys now they're diving into that stuff the women won't put up with it so that's good you know i'm uh you're still hand me the clicker kind of mentality you know but um [mn] i think it's i think it's on the wane 

301.86 303.66 A: mhm 

302.63 313.09 B: um traditional marriages uh seem to be still there in many you know you still you know husband wife children [mn] but i think um 

313.23 315.74 B: [lipsmack] i like seeing the fact that women have 

316.91 323.31 B: uh are sharing and um going out and you know a lot has to do with economics too two people working [sigh] 

322.67 333.32 A: right and like you said about flexibility you know i think part of that flexibility is men are becoming more flexible kind of thing well you know what it's just good for both of us if i do that 

325.08 325.98 B: yeah 

328.47 329.51 B: mhm 

330.15 331.43 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

332.55 334.84 B: mhm it 

333.98 336.15 A: as opposed to saying that's not my job 

335.82 341.31 B: yeah sometimes we have to swallow things that we don't want to swallow and then sometimes it turns out for the better 

341.37 350.20 B: you know i i i've found in my life if i face something about myself that i that someone pointed out to me i mean my wife has pointed these things out to me [mn] 

350.31 353.87 B: if i s- think about it and it's 

354.06 361.39 B: and can effect some change i'm better off and she's better off i told her i said look a bird can't fly with one wing 

361.90 362.69 B: (( huh )) 

362.49 363.24 A: no 

363.10 364.56 B: you gotta have both 

365.07 371.92 B: you know c- otherwise well [lipsmack] and and so through through time you know not that i haven't been self centered i have you know 

372.52 374.31 B: (( um uh )) 

374.49 386.20 B: but sharing is important and giving and if you have a common goal relative to economics and all this thing's one thing and you establish your family and then your family's raised then you have face another [sigh] 

386.41 388.72 B: plateau what do you do now do 

389.12 390.75 B: you do social service 

391.14 397.99 B: do you concentrate on your hobbies [mn] making more money [laughter] retiring to some comfortable spot somewhere [sigh] you know 

397.92 398.95 A: (( [noise] right )) 

398.01 402.26 B: [mn] i g- i i one day i just romance my death you know i sit back and think what 

402.37 405.68 B: what do you to think about yourself when you die do 

406.20 415.89 B: you want to think that you went to florida and [mn] you know [laughter] it's ok to do that i'm just saying i [sigh] i think it's important to f- to ask yourself questions like that [mn] 

412.08 413.19 A: (( [noise] right )) 

416.35 418.26 B: what do i want to do with my life 

418.76 422.67 B: what wh- wh- what would i like to say that i uh

430.97 433.19 B: as a lot as a lot of us do you know i 

433.53 436.75 B: wasted so much time [laughter] 

437.14 446.34 A: yeah and i think a lot of it has to do with uh you know being clear about goals you know where if you're just living everything day to day you're not actually getting you're not going anywhere 

437.16 437.98 B: you know 

441.20 442.41 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

445.76 459.00 B: targets yeah targets are important what what i mean is what's you know it's uh targets are relative to what you think's important i can't impose them on you it has to be relative to me you know don't you think 

456.25 457.25 A: right 

457.96 464.96 A: yeah and then you know with the with uh you know the person you're with you know finding targets that you can both work towards

481.15 483.20 A: (( mhm right )) 

482.41 483.76 B: but that when y- you know uh
