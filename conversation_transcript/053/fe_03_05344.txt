83.44 84.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

85.12 91.60 A: mine don't have any names so 'cause i figured they're not going to live that long anyway so what's the point [laughter] what's the point

89.37 91.72 B: [laughter] 

91.80 92.89 B: (( how long ))

92.98 95.02 B: how long you had 'em 

93.76 101.50 A: um i've uh just had i've had a series of them over [mn] um about eighteen months 

101.63 102.54 B: okay 

102.06 115.46 A: so i d- i don't i i live alone and i don't um have other family members to really um take care of them for longer than um if i'm going to be away longer than f- four or five days 

115.28 116.75 B: so if you go away you 

115.52 120.78 A: so if i do go away if you do go away for four or five days somebody needs to come and clean the tank out 

121.36 122.41 A: um 

121.92 125.39 B: what sa- sa- if you go away for four or five days what 

124.15 126.17 A: yeah usually for f- well 

126.46 130.61 A: if i go away for more than like say a week i sh- i should i mean 

130.63 134.13 A: i should say then i need probably need somebody to take care of them so 

133.66 135.21 B: yeah 

134.36 135.72 A: i haven't um 

137.42 139.56 A: [lipsmack] i haven't been doing much with [sigh] uh 

140.12 144.96 A: you know trying to find other people to take care of 'em that's a kind of a challenge 

143.38 144.21 B: mhm 

145.11 146.09 B: okay 

146.91 155.64 A: um but you know they're nice to have in a climate where you know other pets that run around get too warm in months like this 

148.07 148.63 B: (( [mn] )) 

155.70 157.46 B: mhm 

156.00 159.67 A: which isn't a consideration where you live but [laughter] 

159.19 163.16 B: yeah it's pretty hot it's pretty hot where you are right this time of year mhm 

161.26 166.76 A: yeah yeah i think they're lucky being in water looking at them [laughter] makes you wish you were a fish 

165.44 167.39 B: oh yeah oh okay 

167.22 172.05 A: [laughter] oh yeah it's a hundred and fi- it was a hundred and eight degrees here so the fish were 

171.04 171.88 B: (( hm ooh )) 

172.19 176.57 A: were the lucky people in my house [laughter] um 

173.84 177.07 B: [mn] i guess how many fish do you have 

177.23 183.87 A: um there's like three gold ones and then there's two angel fish 

184.08 187.55 A: and i had another one that was something else it died 

187.48 188.46 B: okay 

187.77 188.77 A: um 

188.81 198.94 A: so actually i'm on the verge of go- actually making a trip soon now to replace them i enjoy going and [mn] and um you know shopping around for them actually 

198.73 201.53 B: uh-huh so you have a total of five fish now then 

199.31 200.20 A: um 

201.13 201.85 A: [laughter] 

201.89 207.30 A: yeah so and i have snails in there which i'm thinking of abandoning 'cause um 

207.58 211.98 A: i was t- i was told that the snails help clean up the thing the um 

210.67 212.46 B: mhm 

212.19 212.84 A: (( [mn] )) 

213.15 223.53 A: the tank but snails also want to breed and um they create more mess in their breeding than is worth in the c- their 

217.33 218.48 B: [mn] okay 

220.85 222.91 B: [laughter] okay 

223.69 226.08 A: benefit in cleaning up the tanks so 

226.12 230.48 A: i think the next thing i'm going to do is eliminate snails 

230.67 234.22 A: so they'll be in there by the fish will be by themselves probably but 

233.76 234.65 B: (( mhm mm mhm )) 

234.64 235.77 A: um 

236.65 246.51 A: [mn] you know and it's it's i mi- i might get a larger tank too that's another thing [sigh] 'cause it it um doesn't cost really that much more to um [lipsmack] 

247.99 259.40 A: have a larger tank and that ac- ac- actually the [sigh] the more water you have i think it might be the less often you have to wo- worry about cleaning out the whole [mn] thing i haven't looked into that 

258.70 262.41 B: yeah it makes a little sense it's it's smaller 

261.28 265.68 A: [mn] so does your do your children take care of everything you [laughter] don't have to do anything 

265.21 270.61 B: no our kids are kind of smart kids their range age from six to eight so u- it's usually my wife's job 

268.72 269.61 A: yeah 

270.46 271.51 A: yeah 

270.72 278.49 B: once in a while i'll feed 'em or they'll feed 'em but usually my wife she likes to do it 'cause you feed it too much [sigh] and he kind of makes a mess you know if you 

273.45 274.45 A: yeah 

276.35 277.40 A: yeah but 

277.83 287.33 A: yeah so you already it sounds like you already tried to r- to to ta- to let the kids feed them and they they went overboard [laughter] yeah [sigh] 

282.90 285.12 B: yeah they 

285.19 295.33 B: yeah they've tried it and well actually we just recently we've let 'em feed him a little bit as long as they scrunch the you know the little flakes up food and and not too much 

294.86 295.94 A: (( yeah mm )) 

295.80 304.40 B: so y- you know i remember and we di- actually when we got goldie as we call him for my son's birthday we actually had two fish at first there was one there was goldie and whitey 

304.27 306.62 A: did one d- jump out or die or what mm 

305.86 309.08 B: n- yeah whitey died within a the first week or so 

309.20 314.58 B: [mn] and we thought goldie you know wouldn't last much longer but boy it's a year and a half still going 

314.52 315.77 A: that's interesting 

314.83 317.99 B: my son's birthday was november ninth and it's last year 

317.01 318.88 A: (( yeah )) 

318.48 319.27 B: so 

318.94 320.61 A: well actually 

319.64 321.45 B: how long do goldfish live do you know 

321.29 326.41 A: um not that very long i don't think maybe two years at the most 

325.92 326.81 B: okay 

326.62 331.17 A: i think i just based on past experience i don't remember one of them living 

331.16 342.89 A: beyond beyond that but you know that's something you have to ask when you go into the store because there's all these different breeds and actually the more attractive ones are more um high maintenance 

342.83 347.97 A: and the goldfish are the low maintenance so you're starting out at the smart place with it 

347.30 348.57 B: (( oh okay )) 

347.76 359.75 A: but you know you want to get ones with little stripes and long tails and all this and this breed and that exotic breed and the fighting one and this and that and [sigh] then you have to find out who wants to live with 

359.74 368.20 A: who and who's going to fight with who and who's going to require special food and you know it gets more involved so 

366.19 367.31 B: oh okay 

369.39 376.03 A: um it's like if you're introducing your kid to a pet it's like having one goldfish is maybe the smart thing to do mm 

375.96 381.73 B: and they're they're happy with just goldfish you know they don't need any exotic things i find 

380.82 385.89 A: so you don't have anything else you don't have cats in the house uh hm yeah um 

383.12 389.98 B: no i'm allergic to cats and no no they're we're talking maybe one day we'll get a dog um just saw 

390.12 394.53 B: we were at the park the other day we saw someone with a beagle my wife said that would be a 

392.54 396.91 A: yeah you might be allergic to dogs too if you're allergic to the cats though 

397.08 401.11 B: yeah did i tell you did i tell you i was allergic to cats 

397.11 398.94 A: unless they're very short hair 

401.01 402.73 A: yeah you just said 

402.33 404.71 B: oh okay [laughter] i didn't remember okay 

403.07 403.95 A: yeah 

404.92 412.80 A: you said you were i my my my ha- my dad is allergic to cats and dogs so you know i just um assumed that 

406.53 407.32 B: (( oh )) 

410.16 415.50 B: mhm [mn] i don't think i'm allergic to dogs it just just cats you know 

413.66 414.48 A: (( you know )) 

414.51 416.70 A: it might depend on the breed 

416.60 419.42 B: oh did you have any pets when as you grew up as a boy 

418.86 421.49 A: oh yeah i had lots of them but um [noise] 

421.95 424.67 A: [lipsmack] um because he was allergic to cats 

425.08 433.85 A: uh to both um we got poodles which um the hair on those were he was l- he was less prone to 

434.09 435.13 A: having a 

435.36 437.14 A: allergic reaction to 

437.60 443.50 A: so um i'm not allergic to anything but i live in a condominium where they're not you're not allowed 

437.95 438.56 B: [mn] 

443.66 450.53 A: [sigh] to which is what i should have said in the beginning is like that we're not allowed to have pets here except for for um 

450.84 457.19 A: that come under scrutiny that like dogs and cats but um you can get away with fish and birds 

452.88 455.50 B: mhm 

457.32 463.24 A: so i considered birds but because i travel once in a while and now like i said i don't have anyone that really 

463.32 477.97 A: um would be kind enough to take care of a bird it with fish people are a little bit okay you know i'll do it [sigh] because they know they just have to throw a little food in there you get it getting down to a bird and then you have to clean out the cage and all this and they don't want to do so 

466.42 468.26 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

477.18 481.69 B: mhm you muck it out yeah right yeah do you travel on business is it 

479.04 480.86 A: yeah 

481.57 491.52 A: yeah and and so it's like not that often but you know just enough to make it a consideration but i would have liked to have gotten a bird for here it would have been 

482.07 482.97 B: for work [noise] 

491.64 495.13 A: it's it's a little bit more you know like companionship and they 

495.26 497.46 A: make a little bit more noise and 

496.02 505.29 B: mhm yeah that's right you know i remember now yeah we did when i was a boy we had a dog named jinx and then i forget my brother did get a bird a parrot 

497.84 498.77 A: (( but mm )) 

505.46 506.97 B: and he was pretty cool 

507.35 510.38 B: [mn] in fact we had we had open cage policy 

510.86 514.18 B: where uh we just left his cage door open he could come out any time he wanted [mn] 

515.23 516.56 A: mm it was a parrot 

516.39 519.64 B: yeah a parrot a little parakeet mhm parakeet mhm 

516.98 517.75 A: (( mm )) 

518.85 524.84 A: yeah i ta- i used to take care of pets as a way to make uh pocket money when i was a kid 

524.92 526.31 A: and um [lipsmack] 

526.73 531.73 A: i used to take care of neighbors who had um both a cat and a um 

532.20 535.12 A: (( [lipsmack] a uh not a parakeet but a a p- )) 

535.55 537.19 A: a cockatiel 

537.53 540.79 A: um which was like a really hostile bird 

540.58 542.27 B: mhm is it 

540.74 549.80 A: so like he got they would they would leave the cage door open like you just described but then i would go in the room to feed it and it was like up in the corner of the room and it would kind of dive bomb you 

549.71 550.97 B: oh c- [laughter] 

549.75 550.96 A: attack you 

550.75 554.77 A: it didn't realize i'm just coming in here to feed you okay [laughter] s- 

553.04 553.68 B: (( mm )) 

554.61 567.28 A: so like this bird would stay un- unfed usually i r- it's funny i get paid for f- not feeding this bird for five days 'cause it was dive bombing me and i got sick of it [mn] trying to attack me you know [laughter] it's kind of a funny um 

565.18 566.88 B: mhm 

567.81 570.03 A: thing that i i 

570.14 574.33 A: i would have liked to have gotten a b- a nice looking bird but they um 

575.02 580.36 A: they al- like i said they seem to seem to require more supervision so i 

580.14 580.96 B: mhm 

581.31 584.24 A: i just have a little boring fish at the moment like you 

583.99 584.86 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

584.91 586.52 A: (( yeah )) 

585.78 589.61 B: yeah but that's the thing with pets their their maintenance 

586.64 587.52 A: (( so )) 

589.55 593.28 A: yeah i was going to get some actually uh um 

590.01 591.56 B: (( when they make a mess mhm )) 

593.37 597.21 A: a friend of mine uh who's breeding um lovebirds 

597.70 599.25 A: wanted me to um
