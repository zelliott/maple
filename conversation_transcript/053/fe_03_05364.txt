0.84 2.05 A: hello 

2.32 3.37 B: hello 

3.46 5.06 A: ah i'm howard 

4.71 5.84 B: i'm david 

5.64 8.70 A: hi this is the first one of these i'm doing so i'm 

7.76 10.34 B: so am i so we're both in the same boat 

9.73 13.69 A: [laughter] all right so you're supposed supposed to talk about the minimum wage 

13.18 14.62 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

14.80 16.34 A: um 

15.99 18.73 B: what it's going up to five fifteen is that what they said 

18.29 20.69 A: yeah i think that's what they said um 

21.75 31.25 A: i don't know i'm generally a ah a free market kind of guy and who would much prefer to ah see these things float on the other hand you know on on their own on the other hand ah 

31.40 34.24 A: it does seem like it's necessary to ah 

34.28 41.48 A: to impose some regulations on the businesses otherwise they really can take advantage of ah of people who have no way to fight back 

40.83 48.21 B: yeah but i think also i mean doesn't it doesn't it make sense that technically it should be also rated by area of cost of living in certain 

48.85 54.54 B: areas i mean five fifteen in a in a low state ver- versus five fifteen in california it's next to nothing 

54.31 60.41 A: well that's that's true yes i actually agree with that that then and don't certain states have a 

60.80 66.13 A: don't certain states also have a state minimum wage that actually can be larger than the federal minimum wage 

65.86 69.40 B: if they have i haven't heard about it but it would be a good idea if there isn't 

69.25 79.29 A: ah no i i think i think that's right um ah clearly if you're going to do this you need to consider the cost of living in the area in which you're you're providing the minimum wage you know cities or 

79.55 82.97 A: just in general cities are more expensive and so on but um 

81.72 82.64 B: yeah 

83.74 92.45 A: ah you know on on on the other hand you know the minimum wage clearly has impact on ah on the businesses too it it it's not a one sided ah 

92.52 93.99 A: one sided issue 

94.43 99.15 A: um and i think that you know that that needs to be considered i i don't find that the 

99.44 109.07 A: i mean it it seems like five five dollars or so an hour and that's ah two hundred dollars a week that's only ten thousand dollars a year that's a subsistence almost anywhere 

108.42 109.37 B: yeah 

109.93 117.35 A: so ah it's it's not like it it it seems like it's a abs- ah excessive um 

117.12 123.91 B: i guess the other piece also that that that kind of interests me is how much um i mean how many exceptions are allowed on this 'cause 

123.84 135.34 B: obviously i know that tipped cer- personnel get paid less than that so what other exceptions are there that people don't realise about and maybe it's like you said haven't impacted on what it actually should be 

135.69 146.09 A: well that that's true ah yeah i i think you're right that um under a certain age you can you can get around around that to some extent though i don't know 

146.46 152.06 A: i don't know how much you know a com- company like mcdonalds for example is able to take advantage of that because they tend to hire 

152.16 153.84 A: a lot of young 

153.92 159.26 A: workers and i think that they're the kind of company that that the minimum wage is likely designed to regulate 

158.82 159.83 B: yeah 

159.92 161.36 A: (( ah um )) 

161.87 169.78 A: [mn] yeah i don't know you know paper boy i mean people deliv- you know to people working like that um kids kids working like that um 

171.20 176.27 A: i you know the the other the other question to ask about it is is whether um 

176.79 183.66 A: there are alternate alternative ways of dealing with the same problem um 

184.18 197.48 A: you you know one it it it's easy to get into a discussion of this and just focus on on that point but the on the point of the wage but the fact of the matter is they're trying to solve a problem which is presumably to make sure that that the workers 

197.27 202.46 A: have at least some subsistence and and the question is is 

202.28 213.02 A: is simply imposing a minimum hourly wage actually the right way to do that or are there some other approaches i don't really now the answer to that question frankly this isn't the topic that i tend to [laughter] think about too much 

212.21 217.82 B: oh no i i see what you mean um it's it's got to be interesting 'cause you g- you got to think that you know here we are we 

213.04 213.60 A: (( [mn] )) 

217.96 224.27 B: are supposedly one of the most expensive manufacturing countries in the world but when you look at the minimum wage it doesn't seem to 

224.32 226.15 B: that doesn't seem to apply 

226.21 231.11 B: so really what is what's it's intent and is it is it w- first of all is it working um you know i mean 

233.07 237.12 B: obviously un- unfortun- fortunately i don't i to intend to employ people at the moment 

238.50 247.68 B: but i'm just thinking i mean that industries do it and does it actually have an impact on the economy and and everything else i kind of do want does it does it cause a problem when they do raise it 

247.68 251.22 A: yeah i you know i d- i don't actually know the answer to that ah i 

251.77 261.52 A: i think that there's a knee jerk reaction for people to say well you're you're making the cost of doing business higher but but in fact you're i think you're right that 

261.57 270.54 A: um certainly w- w- in manufacturing where you have um [mn] ah unions and that kind of thing there are other factors that affect 

270.54 284.69 A: the pay rate and i don't i don't know what businesses are most affected by the minimum wage it's a it may well not be manufacturing it may be that that very few people in in manufacturing are um 

284.84 298.47 A: ah are actually paid at minimum wage because of of unions and just ah competition between factories ah i don't know if the problem's gotten worse you know the past few years when the manufact- manufacturing sector's been in decline 

288.10 288.96 B: yeah 

298.42 301.57 A: whether ah actual hourly 

301.88 311.52 A: wages um or that the actual hourly rates have um decreased i know that people are working less overtime but ah or actually the ah 

311.97 315.40 A: that's even a complicated issue unto itself but um 

314.27 315.54 B: (( yeah [laughter] but )) 

315.59 328.74 A: [laughter] yeah 'cause they ah some businesses are substituting overtime for hiring new employees because then they don't have to pay additional benefits even though the overtime's more expensive but i think that in general the the hour's work has gone down some 

328.52 330.83 A: ah in this in this recession 

331.20 339.57 B: do you i mean yeah but i'm trying to think is is this i mean is this a way of what what is i guess a well m- my my question is what is this going to achieve 

331.20 332.36 A: um 

340.33 345.24 A: yeah i i i right i i think it's as good it's a good question i don't know that we [laughter] 

342.07 343.10 B: (( if anything )) 

345.50 351.61 A: we either of us can answer the question wh- wh- which is as as you say what i mean who 

346.75 347.82 B: [laughter] yeah 

351.76 363.25 A: what what is the worker population and what is the business population that's actually affected by the minimum wage 'cause i suspect that mostly ah certainly in the more expensive areas i just don't think that um 

363.36 369.65 A: people can pay only federal minimum wage and and get you know companies can pay that and get workers 

369.16 370.60 B: no exactly 

370.21 379.62 A: so right for in in that case obviously it would have no affect it just doesn't matter if if you're earning if you pay if you're having to pay eight to ten dollars an hour and the minimum wage is five who cares 

379.89 394.78 A: but but there must be certain industries where that's not true i mean i the fast food industry is the one that keeps coming to mind for me 'cause i know i've read articles where ah in fact the the the fast food industry tends to be one of the most affected by these minimum wage increases 

395.02 396.37 A: um 

396.55 399.98 A: i'm actually curious ah 

400.95 402.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

403.19 405.45 A: ah wage i happen to be at a terminal here 

405.74 417.30 A: ah yeah in fact i just i just typed into google ah minimum wage by state and intra interestingly enough i just the first article is that the washington i just happened to hit onto washington state 

410.76 411.59 B: yeah 

417.17 422.07 A: where effective january first of this year the the w- state minimum wage is seven oh one 

421.72 422.67 B: okay 

422.43 428.56 A: so that's actually higher than the than this federal minimum wage i ah so i wonder how many s- 

429.45 434.14 A: [mn] and and that's washington state which is probably not one of the more expensive [laughter] states in the union 

432.98 435.32 B: (( it's probably not one of the cheapest ones either ah so i guess yeah in )) 

436.10 438.32 A: all right um 

437.97 441.23 B: that sense it's but i mean you got you got to um wonder is it i mean i guess a- a- 

441.05 454.00 B: on the big picture um the one that we can answer as well is is this is this a resource that we should actually be looking at or should we be looking at more how do we get some of the companies that are affected by this to maybe diversify or do other stuff that's not 

454.49 455.74 B: you know i mean ah 

456.18 466.74 B: get into without getting into the union issue with you know trying to maintain industries that basically have been phased out or are no longer required but have just been held onto because of contracts and whatever else 

467.00 471.93 A: right well that's a that that's yes that is a different um 

471.54 473.28 B: animal [laughter] 

472.31 482.18 A: that that is a different problem i i i think that's right i mean there's government government intervention to try to keep dinosaurs alive is generally i think a losing 

482.69 483.89 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

482.83 492.51 A: a losing proposition um and ah you know when when you have structural problems that are causing these industries to to fade um 

493.15 506.74 A: ah you know on on the other hand um i mean it it it is the case that that without the union mechanism oh which seems to be in in decline these days that 

506.68 509.43 A: that the worker doesn't really ah 

509.84 521.07 A: have much much say especially in cases when when employment is tight ah when when employment ah when jobs are tight are hard to find when when the when when unemployment is high 

521.15 522.92 A: and um 

523.12 525.83 A: ah i know it's just ah [mn] 

526.12 529.82 A: the the this is one of these topics that probably um 

530.22 538.09 A: [mn] if we if there was a we if we had a little bit of knowledge about it if we'd [laughter] made some more fruitful discussions 

537.25 550.27 B: well that's it ah 'cause you know you got to think okay what in what in what context are they talking about you know i mean the fact it's going up okay yeah but are you talking in context of how it affects us when you is your industry unionized or is it not 

548.70 556.10 A: [laughter] no no ah i'm i'm a i'm a computer guy and ah you know generally ah 

553.50 554.37 B: okay 

555.25 559.02 B: it's like you said it's a free market that dictates what the salaries should be 

558.93 565.96 A: yeah i mean in in in my businesses i've never had to worry about minimum wage ah i mean well you know even 

566.65 579.85 A: ah [sigh] even um you know in hiring support staff y- y- you never you you pay minimum wage except if it maybe for you know summer help or s- interns or that kind of thing but b- basically 

572.79 573.56 B: no 

580.00 581.54 A: yeah it it 

581.97 586.81 A: in a s- i i think in in any sort of skilled area 

587.36 590.79 A: it seems like the minimum wage is probably not relevant 

591.55 592.67 B: yeah 

592.53 593.84 A: um 

593.16 599.41 B: it's ah that it's it's like you said i mean if it's ah if obviously if if half of this if some of the states are doing it
