10.19 11.90 B: hi i'm patrick bracken 

12.22 13.47 A: (( well hello )) 

13.37 15.37 B: (( ah yeah hey can you hear me )) 

15.21 16.59 A: yep i can hear ya 

15.88 19.79 B: oh great so bioterrorist attacks huh 

19.75 22.59 A: (( yeah i ah )) 

23.50 27.76 A: (( [sigh] i don't know i don't think there's a l- hell of a lot we could do so [laughter] ah )) 

28.46 34.93 B: well i mean yeah i w- i would agree with that you know in terms of in- inevitability aspects i mean eventually there's 

35.11 39.08 B: going to be a r- [cough] you know there w- it's almost impossible to prevent it 

39.23 44.72 B: but i also think that ah there are efforts that we can take to kind to thwart those efforts you know 

44.79 47.12 A: yeah yeah i agree with that definitely 

47.52 50.72 B: (( what what do you think about the possibility of of um )) 

51.07 56.23 B: [lipsmack] attack like bioterrorist bioterrorist attacks on american homeland 

55.90 57.05 A: um 

58.21 61.41 A: i don't know [lipsmack] a lot of that stuff is so 

61.89 64.25 A: it's so easy to carry around i 

64.65 67.81 A: i think the best response would be try to like 

68.25 78.16 A: just keep antidotes or antibodies and stuff around every area because there's not much way to figure out if someone has that there's no metal 

78.35 80.60 A: detectors don't pick it up so 

80.10 82.15 B: that's a good point yeah sure 

82.71 84.33 B: i mean it's yeah i mean 

84.98 87.08 B: the one thing that that kind of f- 

86.89 100.64 B: freaks me out about it is that i i e- even though the antibodies or antidotes might be r- available the the time in which that they are supplied to whatever region is infected i i don't know if the coordination efforts are as 

100.47 105.51 B: great enough to to really get the you know the remedies there quick enough 

105.47 109.29 A: yeah that would be hard and there'd be a big rush on the hospitals and stuff 

106.74 107.57 B: and if 

108.37 110.32 B: yeah i mean seriously 

110.76 115.33 B: (( do you ah do you metro to work or not metro but do you take a subway or public transportation to work )) 

114.87 116.20 A: (( yeah i do ah [noise] )) 

115.89 130.68 B: yeah same here i'd s- sometimes i get like a a little freaked out by it because i'm not sure how prepared the public transport system is for an attack and we- what i mean from you know from the news like we've heard from attacks in japan 

130.78 139.90 B: and and other mass transit areas where people are just kind of sealed in and don't really have an out and the response time was ridiculously slow 

139.97 141.41 B: and events like that 

140.01 140.80 A: yeah 

142.14 146.82 A: [noise] yeah that would suck over here it's all above ground bussing so 

146.36 147.38 B: where are you 

147.08 149.18 A: it's not as i'm in seattle 

148.67 150.82 B: seattle right i'm in washington 

149.57 150.47 A: yeah 

151.30 152.99 A: m- cool east 

152.39 154.53 B: yeah 

153.92 154.78 A: (( oh )) 

155.49 156.80 A: that would be ah 

158.25 159.14 A: (( i don't know )) 

160.19 163.13 A: it's probably one of the up there target areas yeah 

163.16 168.40 B: [laughter] yeah well e- every time they um up the security alert 

168.54 176.28 B: like the the washington goes crazy much like new york but it's noticeable but within hours after they've upped the alert 

176.31 177.24 A: huh 

177.03 182.45 B: um which is pretty amazing and i i'm not i'm i'm curious to see if other cities are as equally 

182.67 185.56 B: um mobile after the um 

186.06 187.07 A: really 

186.53 200.68 B: depart land of homeland the department of homeland security ups their alert um yeah around here like the cops are on the streets like within a couple of hours and you can definitely sense i mean even if you haven't even heard of the alert you can kind of pick up on it just by walking around 

200.74 208.25 A: wow see over here we don't even pay any attention to those at all they're kind of a a joke over here nobody 

207.66 209.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

209.39 211.35 A: nobody really thinks about 'em at all 

211.80 219.87 B: yeah that's an interesting dynamic i mean you figure if you live in a city that's not i mean washington was already attacked and along with new york 

219.91 223.64 B: y- you figure like those two cities i mean i definitely sensed a ah 

221.90 222.87 A: [noise] 

224.20 230.60 B: an apprehension and a a more awareness about it but friends that i have in dallas texas and um 

230.78 240.08 B: [lipsmack] even like in the south like in florida they don't they don't [laughter] really see the s- the same ah s- significance attached with the [lipsmack] um raising of the security alerts 

239.89 244.06 A: yeah yeah we don't really notice that much over here i guess we're just 

242.87 244.63 B: yeah 

244.20 246.66 A: it's kind of an east coast thing over 

246.09 250.98 B: [laughter] sure right east coast west coast well i mean they do say that you know 

251.06 258.35 B: the the the public works structures like bridges and and things like that are at risk and at least in san francisco 

258.61 259.59 B: um 

259.93 262.00 B: and they've upped the security on those 

261.67 263.80 A: yeah there is that 

263.93 265.76 A: (( i know yeah )) 

266.18 268.43 A: we tend to ah have a lot of 

268.96 273.91 A: like if there was anything nuclear we're probably target number one but other than that w- [laughter] 

274.09 275.86 B: why why is that 

275.41 276.50 A: um 

276.55 286.77 A: actually over here um seattle's right next to the largest nuclear submarine base in [noise] the world and we have boeing which makes a lot of military aircraft and we have a 

285.67 286.92 B: yeah sure 

287.37 289.97 A: bunch of stuff like that so 

289.35 290.30 B: oh wow 

290.57 291.79 A: so yeah 

291.46 296.44 B: oh that's kinda freaky [laughter] ah on top of the ah the bioterrorist attack 

296.32 297.39 A: (( yeah uh )) 

296.64 301.55 B: i i actually i had a friend who she works as like um an office manager 

301.50 314.51 B: and about three months ago and i was curious as to find out if this was a prevalent thing in at least in the private sector [lipsmack] but um her boss had had instructed her to order gas masks and um 

314.73 317.51 B: duct tape [laughter] for the entire office 

317.71 322.17 B: and it was it was an incredible expense it they it was like a a thirty person firm 

322.31 327.66 B: and they spent close to like five or s- like five to ten thousand dollars on like [laughter] all their supplies 

328.00 330.91 B: which was pretty amazing in terms of um 

331.09 335.02 B: you know the des- the employers willingness to do but then also [lipsmack] 

335.01 347.46 B: the ah you know the viability of the threat i mean most companies aren't gonna pay that money unless they feel like there a liability and i guess in fact there is a liability like um for companies that 

347.71 352.15 B: that don't [sigh] protect or provide a safe working environment 

352.36 359.51 B: for their employees they can be you know held culpable under under um i guess it's employment laws i'm not really sure 

359.68 360.72 B: (( but um )) 

361.70 370.47 B: totally different feeling i suppose like just in every day life but compared to other countries you know that that deal with this all the time it's fairly normal you know 

370.25 371.16 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

370.56 371.95 B: (( ah and with the [noise] )) 

371.43 376.30 A: yeah over here we just got a there was a bit of a rush early on 

375.27 380.66 B: [noise] mhm ah yeah give me like two minutes um yes sorry i had someone 

380.61 381.73 A: that's all right 

380.74 383.04 B: ah can can you just say that again i'm sorry [noise] 

382.92 389.40 A: yeah ear- early on there was a bit of a rush on stuff like that like our house we picked up a bunch of ah you know 

390.06 398.91 A: ah jugs of water and gas masks and rope and food and stuff in case something happened but it tapered down pretty quick over here ah 

398.61 406.53 B: oh right yeah i mean i would think that most people around here especially since it's been so long since the last attack at least on american soil 

406.54 407.54 B: um 

408.18 414.72 B: the idea has has subsided but i got in a big debate a while ago about um 

414.53 424.49 B: whether or not the the government had been doing enough to to s- you know to keep its citizens informed 

423.91 425.05 A: yeah 

424.54 428.49 B: on what was going on which is ah i i mean that's um 

428.54 439.39 B: it's an it's an understandable question but at the same time like you wanna be able to give the government a little bit of leeway in terms of keeping things like kind of on the dole an- and also not advertising 

439.04 440.18 A: yeah 

439.56 442.61 B: but then there's also the idea that people wanna be informed you know 

442.53 446.87 A: [noise] sure i- it's also it's it's really hard to keep up with all that stuff i 

446.86 447.88 B: mhm 

446.93 450.47 A: mean my ah my parents were both cops 

450.55 452.68 A: (( and ah you know [noise] like )) 

450.81 451.73 B: ah 

452.70 454.89 A: they're both retired now but even 

454.99 463.50 A: back when they were working you'd get like thirty prank calls a day of like bomb threats and shit going down and all sorts of craziness [noise] 

460.77 462.16 B: ah 

463.70 471.05 B: yeah i mean that's im- it's virtually impossible to assess the reliability of particular calls without y- 

471.10 478.38 B: you know putting research into it and that's the a devotion of resources and that's that's the whole key there you know 

478.34 479.45 A: (( yeah yep )) 

478.58 484.80 B: and they can't like every time someone calls in a prank call they can't you know alert the nation that's r- you know that's ridiculous to say that but 

485.78 486.76 B: huh 

487.20 488.81 A: (( yeah it ah )) 

489.71 491.42 A: i don't know it's a big mess 

491.61 494.46 B: [laughter] are you traveling overseas any time soon 

494.50 495.55 A: am i what 

495.45 497.73 B: are you gonna travel overseas any time soon 

497.89 500.08 A: oh no no no [laughter] first 

499.46 501.06 B: yeah you're you're 

501.13 504.42 B: i i know a lot of people have cancelled their trips overseas 

504.54 505.95 B: just because of the 

506.32 508.61 A: [noise] of course i'm also poor so 

508.34 513.42 B: [laughter] right well yeah that's kinda harder to to travel then um 

512.28 514.09 A: (( yeah actually i thought )) 

513.77 517.85 B: regardless of what [laughter] the hell is going on in ah in world affairs 

517.76 521.35 A: yep like i was actually thinking of taking a trip 

521.19 521.75 B: (( mm )) 

521.45 524.04 A: pretty fast after the ah 

524.41 536.56 A: like the original attacks just because i figured nobody would be doing it again real soon and everything was suddenly really really cheap but i decided against it i was kinda ah [laughter] yeah 

532.47 533.48 B: i know 

536.96 538.48 A: (( [noise] yeah wh- )) 

537.65 551.42 B: yeah i know totally i um i i had braved the the ah [laughter] the alerts and it was just actually during sars s- um scare but ah i took off for france for like a week and a half 

551.43 552.09 A: (( ah )) 

551.50 557.34 B: and the plane flight apparently like the you know the flight staff that do that flight like daily basically 

557.41 565.12 B: they couldn't believe the drop off 'cause the flight was like not even f- it was like barely full you know they were like maybe i don't even remember but maybe half 

565.24 566.52 B: full or whatever 

567.40 568.65 B: are you still there 

568.34 569.64 A: (( yeah i'm still here ))

571.07 572.49 A: oh it's all right 

572.29 579.63 B: um [lipsmack] yeah and they were s- they were saying that it was it was such a noticeable drop off they were really surprised that anyone even decided to fly 

579.75 583.87 B: and that's not about terrorism sure but it's you know the same idea i think 

583.16 588.83 A: yeah i was actually flying the day the ah on september eleventh so that was 

588.98 590.90 A: (( kind of int- yeah ))
