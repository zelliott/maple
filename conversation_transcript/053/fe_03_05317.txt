68.50 78.19 A: [noise] yeah i've never had i don't really watch boxing on t._v. that much unless it's really uh large but but probably my favorite would be uh college football as far as t._v. sports 

77.62 78.78 B: is that right 

78.40 79.55 A: yeah 

78.93 80.53 B: college football huh 

79.96 81.88 A: yeah yeah 

80.78 91.78 B: it it's interesting it's probably more action i have to laugh sometimes when i watch uh television especially college uh football how how much faster the game is 

91.14 93.89 A: [noise] it's a lot faster and of course uh they're 

94.17 102.90 A: uh especially you know in leagues like over here where you got the a._c._c. and um the southeast colleges you know an- anybody could win on a particular saturday so it 

98.12 98.99 B: yeah 

102.00 104.03 B: (( that's right )) 

102.90 109.35 A: it's you know it's it and and and the favorites uh many times can be upset real easy um 

109.24 121.69 A: and the underdogs can come out winning fairly big and uh i went to an a._c._c. school so i'm familiar with the uh leagues over here and that's what we get to see but sometimes you know it's always nice to watch um 

122.29 123.80 B: well you could definitely 

122.67 123.98 A: (( your old college play )) 

123.84 127.12 B: you can definitely see some of your future quarterbacks 

126.53 128.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah )) 

127.57 135.76 B: for pro ball it's uh and i've already written down names and sure enough they uh went with various teams uh several years later 

128.76 129.54 A: yeah 

136.18 141.41 B: uh one of them was ryan leaf unfortunately for us you know but uh 

139.53 140.60 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

141.55 145.25 B: yeah yeah definitely and also you don't see a lot of potbellies 

144.82 146.36 A: (( right right )) 

145.53 154.35 B: you know it's uh kind of interesting and uh they'll take a lot of chances is [noise] kind of what i like uh they'll do things that pros won't do 

154.24 155.41 A: yeah 

154.78 157.87 B: but uh uh are you a basketball fan 

157.18 157.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

157.82 168.14 A: i am but not as much as football [noise] it's more on the college level than on the pro level in fact i don't even follow pro basketball um i have no allegiance to anybody there but 

162.36 163.41 B: uh-huh 

167.91 179.38 A: but uh i i'm sure that has to do again being with some of the a._c._c. schools and reputations they have the uh s- speed of the game and the excitement of the game on the college side um so yeah 

178.03 181.38 B: now you you said what sou- you said south carolina right 

180.71 182.59 A: [lipsmack] i'm in south carolina right [noise] 

181.74 183.70 B: yeah now uh 

184.41 191.25 B: is the college uh sports i don't want to plead ignorant here but college sports is is it big there 

191.74 200.88 A: very big as a matter of fact where i live in greenville uh we have clemson university which is just you know just down the road and of course uh [noise] 

196.43 197.85 B: oh that's right 

200.67 210.24 A: there are uh uh uh college football they're i- it's it's a very interesting saturday afternoon when you go to death valley [noise] and watch them um 

210.62 223.50 A: the reputation is not as big as uh i'm from oklahoma originally so you know being a sooner fan also it's [noise] it's not as [noise] they they don't have as long lived history of uh football greatness as somebody like oklahoma or nebraska 

222.78 223.85 B: (( right [noise] )) 

223.40 228.71 A: uh but but in south east it's you know er they still have some pretty uh strong 

228.72 231.89 A: [noise] uh rivalries uh among the schools [noise] 

230.58 235.41 B: well i i'm from originally from cleveland ohio but i'm here twenty one years but uh 

233.13 234.03 A: okay 

235.49 242.09 B: we had a lot of good teams uh in college around the area and uh i probably was uh 

238.33 240.01 A: mhm 

242.63 250.26 B: well i know that i was playing a lot of the pools just for the fun of it too but uh it's where i felt the m- most excitement was 

245.67 246.26 A: (( [noise] )) 

250.07 251.03 A: (( right [noise] )) 

250.29 254.17 B: uh because the cleveland browns did nothing as you i'm sure you know 

252.84 254.21 A: (( right right yeah [noise] )) 

254.33 255.79 B: uh but uh 

256.15 266.07 B: the various the universities in ohio were pretty [noise] pretty loyal and uh they had some nice kids coming out of there and i think it was a good thing for 

266.25 269.47 B: uh the universities as far as uh income too 

269.88 271.09 B: they uh [lipsmack] 

269.93 271.51 A: (( [noise] oh yeah )) 

271.18 279.32 B: i i went to kent state and i don't remember kent ever getting involved though i think at one point we were asked to vote on it 

274.96 275.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

276.29 277.16 A: yeah 

279.08 280.54 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

279.69 287.57 B: and uh the parents uh mostly vetoed it but the kids yeah the kids basically wanted to i think they wanted some [noise] 

283.59 284.82 A: [noise] oh really 

287.88 300.27 B: particular monies uh pledged for the initial start up and i guess a lot of the parents declined uh from that basis but uh i was kind of hoping it it would start uh 

295.63 297.11 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

299.81 301.18 A: yeah 

300.76 308.21 B: i uh always liked the the quarterbacking end of it because uh i did so much of it er growing up 

304.82 305.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

305.81 306.58 A: [noise] 

308.25 322.09 B: it was a way to uh s- well we'd just take a street and occupy it you know play ball in the street and uh sometimes there were no boundaries i'd send a guy back and uh he went way back 'til there was nobody with him and that's how he threw it 

312.83 314.81 A: right yeah 

318.03 320.38 A: [laughter] 

321.07 322.32 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

322.12 328.56 B: but it was always a lot of fun and uh i like baseball i played that uh up to class a ball 

323.67 325.06 A: (( yeah yeah [noise] )) 

328.06 329.56 A: wow [noise] 

328.76 336.97 B: yeah it was uh a lot of fun it kept me out of trouble and uh i'd s- go from nine o'clock in the morning 'til sometimes ten at night [noise] [noise] 

337.11 349.04 A: yeah now about the baseball we have a little uh minor league team here that uh feeds on to the atlanta braves and uh yeah it's fun to go out to the stadium and but that's that's to me that's more just the uh atmosphere 

349.00 353.87 A: uh than it is the game itself i mean we have some good games out there every once in a while but um 

353.96 368.51 B: well i do that f- kind of to get a feel of what's happening too though a lot of times i'll go to a a buddy of mine will come into town and we'll go to a game that we're total strangers of just to see what's happening and the kids and uh a little excitement for an hour or two uh 

357.07 358.00 A: right 

364.44 365.68 A: right 

367.95 369.20 A: mhm

379.08 380.78 B: and uh 

382.41 384.34 B: (( uh what in the hell was the uh )) 

385.00 389.29 B: his opponent it was my wife was telling me this morning and i forgot 

389.39 391.47 B: the champion now currently 

391.45 392.78 A: yeah uh 

393.02 396.40 B: and they're they're supposed to fight i think it's june twenty fourth 

396.98 398.38 A: and is that 

397.76 400.32 B: that'll be one to watch because uh 

399.31 400.25 A: it 

400.63 401.51 B: (( it's )) 

400.67 408.18 A: now where do you normally watch it is it on things such as h._b._o. or or the v._s._b._n. h._b._o. mostly yeah yeah but 'cause i've got 

403.81 410.33 B: yeah exactly exactly yeah showtime have it but the h._b._o.'s got it now 

408.39 409.36 A: yeah 

410.09 424.12 A: because when you first said that the first thought that when through my mind was i never see boxing on t._v. except on h._b._o. [noise] i mean [noise] i don't see it on e._s._p._n. or espn2 that much [noise] um [noise] i've i think i've [noise] seen it maybe on fox [noise] um 

424.16 426.33 A: [lipsmack] sports channel but i'm not sure [noise] 

426.01 429.42 B: yeah it is uh showtime and h._b._o. out here 

428.47 429.95 A: okay okay 

429.56 442.30 B: and uh it's uh you know years ago it started off as being a seven to twelve dollar i think for pay per view you know and now it's up to i don't know what's there uh in carolina but it's uh 

436.35 438.46 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

442.54 444.72 B: it's fifty four dollars here 

444.10 448.32 A: i'm i'm sure i'm sure being since it's h._b._o. it'll be about the same price um 

447.63 449.65 B: yeah which uh 

448.56 460.09 A: unfortunately we don't we're not that much less expensive when it comes to things like that anything that's [noise] has to do with cable and technology in fact a lot of utilities i think are much higher out here in the southeast than they are elsewhere because 

459.18 465.80 B: now the i'm wondering that's something that you're saying because i was interested in i'm getting some property in nashville 

465.08 467.72 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

466.07 474.80 B: and uh i was wondering uh a lot of things like that uh how what's the utility thing and uh if there's sports how much the cable costs are 

474.82 477.33 B: 'cause they're about ninety bucks a month here 

476.92 478.21 A: are they well then 

478.02 488.96 A: well then i may recount my statement a little bit because here in south carolina greenville which now greenville is the largest market in south carolina and um we have charter as our cable provider 

488.78 496.00 A: uh we only you know we only have the one provider um it is a regulated monopoly and um but [noise] i have 

492.58 493.92 B: yeah right 

495.86 505.93 A: uh what they call digital h._b._o. in our house which gives you all the h._b._o. channels all the digital package plus high speed internet access for sixty five dollars 

500.87 501.88 B: right 

505.53 508.42 B: now and see that's exactly what i have 

508.14 510.56 A: okay [noise] and you're paying how much for it 

508.87 509.99 B: uh 

510.06 512.40 B: ninety ninety one or ninety two 

510.86 513.18 A: yeah okay yeah 

512.49 516.66 B: and then of course the pay per views are extra with the sports events you know 

516.05 517.80 A: right right 

517.17 522.36 B: uh the only thing i like uh i like tennis a lot because uh i uh 

522.54 534.75 B: had a leg injury playing baseball and i played tennis because i didn't move around move around too much so i kind of gravitated to it and got interested in it but um thank god the tennis isn't uh 

525.98 527.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

534.90 536.46 B: you know pay per view 

535.49 539.20 A: [noise] right yeah 

536.60 544.39 B: but uh i just find that uh uh the baseball out here with the padres as you know they're in the cellar again 

539.63 540.20 A: (( [noise] )) 

544.00 545.41 A: right 

544.79 550.39 B: and they keep saying uh these are new man so young boys so give it another year 

549.94 551.02 A: (( [noise] [laughter] [mn] )) 

550.70 554.58 B: i've heard another year for almost the twenty one years i've been out here 

553.88 555.95 A: [noise] yeah yeah 

554.99 561.70 B: and it's kind of disgusting uh also the chargers i guess you know about them they're not doing much 

556.35 556.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

559.64 560.54 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

561.80 564.25 B: and again we lost uh 

564.50 568.93 B: we lost junior seau which is was a great uh football player 

566.25 567.02 A: (( [noise] )) 

568.78 572.57 A: mhm yeah i've never had i've never had the pleasure of uh 

569.60 570.72 B: but uh 

572.73 580.61 A: going to san diego so i haven't had the chance to see any of the pro teams there you know i understand that you guys have great weather out there [noise] and um 

578.70 580.09 B: oh yeah 

581.13 586.08 B: but you know something uh great weather but the average [noise] house here now is almost uh 

581.19 582.24 A: (( [noise] but als- )) 

586.36 588.43 B: three hundred and ninety thousand 

587.79 591.24 A: [noise] yeah well when you pay the price for that weather you're right because uh 

590.16 597.71 B: oh that's that's exactly what i said when i moved from cleveland there twenty one years ago i said to my wife jeeze we're paying a lot of money for this weather 

592.13 595.32 A: yeah yeah yeah [noise] 

597.53 598.70 A: yeah 

598.17 599.89 B: and uh after a while
