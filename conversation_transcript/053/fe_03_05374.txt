39.83 47.93 B: you know what i've lived in a trailer before making like ten bucks an hour and it still was not even enough to live off of 

48.40 51.08 B: i mean i don't see how anybody can live off five fifteen 

52.55 54.94 B: (( i mean i think it's pretty ridiculous huh )) 

52.55 53.66 A: so 

54.37 67.11 A: i i don't really think it's yeah it is but if they expect people to live off of it but i i don't think they do i think most minimum wage jobs go to teenagers fresh out like still in high school you know 

67.39 76.34 B: it should but you know sometimes like older guys or or even women they get matched up they get a divorce they haven't been in the job market for a while or running their own business 

76.31 77.69 A: yeah that's true 

76.40 84.71 B: and you know the way the way the economy is now a lot of times even people who are administrative or computer guys are getting jobs and have to live off what they can make 

84.60 95.33 A: yeah and i know exactly how it is my dad actually just lost his job and he's he's like applying for six seven dollar jobs you know seven dollar an hour jobs 

89.02 90.83 B: mhm 

93.59 94.84 B: yeah 

95.67 98.44 B: and i don't i don't think anybody can live off five fifteen

98.45 99.43 A: no 

99.58 103.67 B: i mean if you live with your parents you could if you help out a little bit 

101.66 102.91 A: yeah that's what i'm 

103.22 110.03 A: that's what i'm saying see i i figure it's for like the kids who have after school jobs you know or 

110.17 115.28 A: you know how they have the kids working the little carts in the middle of the mall you know 

114.34 116.61 B: oh hell yeah 

116.03 119.39 A: i mean you know they're not getting paid more than six dollars an hour 

119.59 124.60 B: oh god i ran a business and i ran the wholesale divi- 

124.77 130.24 B: but we had a store and the owner would only pay the people that were like checkers and stuff 

130.27 132.66 B: you know like five fifty an hour 

130.46 131.30 A: yeah 

132.57 134.42 A: right 

133.34 139.38 B: and he always wondered about how come he never had any good help they would miss work to go to a party or whatever 

138.39 139.84 A: oh definitely 

140.01 151.18 A: i i've done i've done that i've like sat there and considered hm is is it you know if i go to work and get thirty five dollars for the day can i afford to miss that hell yeah i can 

140.12 141.37 B: you know you get what you 

151.32 158.75 B: oh hell yeah 'cause i mean basically you can stand there on a street corner and wait for a construction worker to drive by looking for a laborer 

158.76 159.77 A: right 

159.05 161.72 B: and get paid eight bucks an hour under the table 

161.41 172.89 A: yeah definitely so i i mean i i think it's i think minimum wage sucks but the the fact that they're raising it seems to be pretty cool 

163.99 165.42 B: yeah 

173.07 176.44 B: ah ah yeah are they going to raise it or are they just talking about it 

178.24 179.31 A: (( i don't know )) 

178.60 182.12 B: 'cause 'cause bush promises a lot of things like his dad did 

182.43 185.26 B: and promises don't really go very far

201.89 205.08 B: you know they're all corrupt and want to make money for their own buddies 

204.92 209.22 A: oh you're lucky you don't have a bush running your state

232.14 233.83 B: and you have no recourse 

234.21 235.34 A: (( no )) 

236.92 239.67 B: it's not like you can even file a complaint 

239.02 241.15 A: [laughter] that's yeah that's pretty much 

241.83 248.78 B: [laughter] yeah damn it's pretty hard to talk about minimum wage for ten minutes but i know we're obligated for at least eight minutes of 

243.04 244.02 A: [laughter] 

246.62 248.87 A: it is how long has it been 

249.82 254.02 B: (( well i see ah ah do you know people that work for minimum wage )) 

254.41 255.29 A: (( huh )) 

255.30 257.46 B: you know people that work for minimum wage 

257.25 260.23 A: i don't not any more like i i used to 

259.13 260.48 B: i don't either 

260.70 271.49 A: yeah i i used to know people like i i'm pretty close to it but ah like i get seven dollars an hour that's pretty that's pretty screwed up 

269.67 271.93 B: oh but you're what about twenty twenty one 

271.98 272.97 A: twenty 

273.13 275.49 B: yeah see that's that's pretty acceptable though 

276.46 279.24 B: people don't like to give young people ah very much money 

276.53 277.20 A: (( oh )) 

279.29 280.54 A: no they don't 

281.06 285.33 B: you know you have to build your reputation and things like that 

284.34 290.85 A: like ah there's one job where i got minimum wage but i was only there for like a month so it doesn't really matter 

290.92 295.14 B: yeah i know and i know people that work sub minimum wage but they get tips 

298.33 301.46 A: say that again my phone's ah screwing up 

298.63 299.45 B: (( ah )) 

301.10 301.94 B: huh 

301.59 304.57 A: i said say that again my phone's screwing up 

303.99 308.64 B: oh i'm sorry i said i hope people that work for less than minimum wage that they get tips 

308.40 313.23 A: yeah like servers ah that seems that seems kind of strange to me too 

310.22 312.60 B: yeah definitely 

313.67 318.45 B: well yeah i know but the government was really worried that they were not claiming their tips 

319.04 321.08 B: and so rather than 

319.13 320.05 A: yeah 

321.46 325.22 B: count on the honesty of a waitress or waiter to claim their tips 

325.39 332.60 B: they decided to ah just assume they had enough tips and tip 'em on how much the government projected they would make 

325.40 326.29 A: oh 

332.85 334.64 A: yeah 

333.01 335.99 B: but if you but if you tip then you're screwed 

336.26 338.60 B: you get taxed on stuff you didn't even earn 

339.20 341.04 A: yeah 

341.37 348.03 A: so ah i i'm horrible like that i don't tip that much i i should i i know i should tip way more than i do 

348.41 353.19 B: oh well yeah my mom and my girlfriend and everybody i know is like oh waitresses and stuff 

353.23 365.47 B: we're not really very ah upscale in this part of the country and ah so whenever i see a girl that brings me a beer or something i think well heck that could be my mom or my girlfriend or my little sister or something so 

356.51 357.51 A: (( [laughter] )) 

365.45 366.58 A: yeah 

365.50 369.17 B: i always do it at minimum twenty percent 

368.57 369.43 A: (( oh )) 

370.35 373.35 B: but yeah five fifteen i thought they raised that a long time ago 

373.82 377.04 A: i don't know was it five fifteen or five fifty 

377.28 379.04 B: no five fifteen 

379.32 380.37 A: gees 

380.72 389.29 B: that's what the equivalent of ah ten thousand dollars a year and the poverty level according to the government is is slated around at eighteen or twenty thousand 

390.24 391.16 A: (( yeah ah )) 

390.25 394.54 B: so minimum wage is ab- is a little bit more than half the poverty level 

397.18 399.94 A: (( that's that's actually [laughter] not that bad [laughter] )) 

399.95 400.78 B: huh 

400.90 404.76 A: that's not that bad that's half poverty 

404.79 409.49 B: yeah if you work for minimum wage you're making half of what they consider to be poverty 

409.36 410.39 A: oh 

410.91 419.80 B: yeah well if you break it down look at it okay five fifteen a week is about two hundred dollars and about two twenty a week 

411.84 412.83 A: gee 

419.77 420.66 A: (( uh-huh )) 

419.96 423.91 B: minus taxes which breaks it down to about one fifty or one sixty 

424.31 431.44 B: now multiply times four for the month you're talking about making about six hundred and sixty six hundred and eighty a month 

431.19 432.95 A: what are taxes there 

433.17 441.01 B: well it depends i mean if you don't make very much they could be like ten or fifteen percent well you know same as the federals same everywhere 

441.02 445.15 B: our state taxes run about fifty a month i mean fifty a year sorry 

445.48 446.98 A: right 

446.88 448.39 B: but i mean the federal 

448.49 451.86 B: i mean they take about a a quarter of what you make 

453.64 457.20 B: and so then you're talking about six hundred and something a month 

456.25 457.92 A: i guess they do [laughter] 

458.03 467.84 B: and my rent i i rent this like a little cheesy two bedroom apartment my rent is six hundred if i have to pay my cable bill and my heat and electricity and stuff

527.52 529.21 A: [laughter] 

531.99 533.15 A: [laughter] 

533.31 534.36 B: no i mean 

534.51 542.40 B: you know what i personally would not work for any less than fifteen an hour but i'm older than you i know when you're younger you've got to like kind of break your way in

568.56 569.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

570.06 576.36 B: i don't know what the purpose is in that i know the libertarians say [noise] there should be no minimum wage because the market should dictate 

576.61 577.62 B: um 

577.69 579.60 B: whatever the market bears 

579.27 586.36 A: yeah but then ah my pay would go from seven dollars an hour to about three and that's not cool 

585.79 591.95 B: you're right and that's why the government partially controls the economy to keep bus- big business from exploiting people 

592.37 599.89 A: oh i think if the economy's screwed up then the government would get screwed over if and you know they're not going to let that happen
