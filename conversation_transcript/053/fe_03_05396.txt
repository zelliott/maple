190.61 192.03 A: what did they tell you 

193.32 194.26 A: okay 

195.04 200.68 A: okay 'cause i know that when i spoke to the lady there [mn] they said that you could uh 

200.66 207.43 A: uh make three calls now but there seems to be only one topic [mn] so i don't know if you could call uh 

207.31 215.87 A: a few people and talk about this one topic or at a certain time of the night or day that you you know you want someone to call you 

216.12 218.11 B: yeah well it says two to twelve 

217.95 222.19 A: okay yeah but my calls are just basic 'cause i work during the day 

221.98 222.84 B: uh-huh 

222.22 232.87 A: [mn] and uh i have the calls from six to eight [mn] uh coming in or if i wanna make a call i'd rather make it like six to eight at night you know it would be the best time after dinner 

230.80 231.63 B: yeah 

232.66 238.29 A: so uh [mn] yeah i would i would uh head out take that million dollars and uh 

232.76 234.58 B: there never even asked me that 

237.16 238.66 B: (( [noise] [cough] [noise] [noise] )) 

238.74 243.02 A: the only thi- [mn] well you know it's like you gotta make sure you're well placed where you're gonna be 

242.92 252.76 B: yeah that's what i'm saying one million dollars if i go down to jamaica there with a million bucks i can always get back to canada and find some place that you know just the rest of the stay you know 

243.78 246.18 A: well why do you like j- huh 

248.89 249.85 A: uh-huh 

250.30 251.15 A: uh-huh

255.57 256.57 A: okay 

257.32 269.41 A: okay so that would make it uh you know convenient for you [mn] 'cause i know that you could go like i i guess puerto rico would be one [mn] but i heard a lot of bad things about puerto rico [mn] but hawaii 

261.42 262.44 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

267.79 275.59 B: yeah but see really in the lo- [sigh] yeah really in the long run you gotta look ahead and see which ones that are safe enough to get [laughter] to you know what i mean 

274.88 279.49 A: well if you had a million dollars i guess you can go live anywhere you want 

278.87 288.14 B: yeah but not [noise] where there's always bombings and stuff like that i wouldn't want to go there [laughter] you know where there's terrorists or something like that i'd rather pick a good country you know that [noise] [noise] 

281.76 284.45 A: yeah no no no 

284.59 287.04 A: no well like 

287.27 293.80 A: yeah 'cause canada uh like you could go into uh [mn] i guess montreal 

293.81 304.93 A: or quebec or one of them places around here and set up shop or find yourself a job i still i guess you would still have to work i don't know with a million dollars 

295.41 296.40 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

303.26 304.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] )) 

304.72 311.86 B: no you still wouldn't ha- if y- if you work i bet i i wouldn't work the rest of my life if i got a million bucks [laughter] yeah really i [mn] 

309.45 316.22 A: really well it's all according to what your cost of living is too i i think you put that in the bank and uh 

313.19 315.43 B: (( mm yeah that's a [cough] )) 

316.34 317.25 B: [noise] 

316.37 320.55 A: draw like uh i guess what five percent interest 

319.89 329.93 B: yeah i mean you you can draw interest enough probably to last a while i mean you know what i mean i mean all you have to do is to live your basic ways you don't have to go out and just splurge for a like a 

324.58 325.39 A: (( mhm mm )) 

330.05 333.21 B: cadillac cost two hundred thousand dollars [mn] no

336.30 337.09 A: (( car )) 

337.42 341.44 A: for like fifty thousand you know but that would be like nice to even 

341.38 351.59 A: uh think of it's like if you hit the lottery or something like that [mn] you know that's the first thing you would do is go out and get yourself something decent [mn] but there i would uh 

345.79 346.80 B: yeah 

350.17 350.85 B: (( [noise] )) 

351.41 361.36 A: i would do it i wouldn't care for the come back especially my age now if you were [mn] a younger guy like uh twenty two years old or [mn] twenty three years old
