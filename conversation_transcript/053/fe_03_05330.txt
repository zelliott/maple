103.14 103.93 A: mm

139.48 141.68 A: (( oh okay ))

180.90 182.08 B: yeah 

181.46 184.93 A: it's not like those little toy ones so it wasn't bad 

185.00 190.41 A: everyone in my family was allergic to a- you know animal hair and that's one of the only dogs that doesn't shed 

190.60 191.76 B: (( oh okay )) 

191.45 199.32 A: so my dad got one of those but it ended up going crazy by the time it was like thirteen and had to put it out [cough]

216.95 228.76 B: uh my wife and i both work so it's really not fair i have a lot of friends that do that but i don't think it's fair to the animal to you know pen it up all day or put it in a cage or 

228.54 234.56 A: right you gotta let it [cough] can't let it be all alone all the time especially when it's a puppy 

235.21 237.69 B: exactly exactly so 

237.74 242.11 B: maybe once we start having kids and my wife maybe stays home

250.76 252.07 B: what dogs 

251.58 253.35 A: yeah 

252.77 255.71 B: ah any dog if if it's trained well enough 

256.80 259.75 B: you know it you don't have to worry about 'em i know 

259.92 262.60 B: sheps are very protective 

262.62 266.79 B: um my parents always had shepherds when we were growing up so 

266.97 270.13 B: you just had to watch 'em around other people like if people 

270.70 275.22 B: would go after or fooling around with just anyone in the family 

275.60 278.30 B: you know the the dog would get upset 

278.33 279.54 A: [noise] wow 

280.42 292.19 A: i've i heard stories you know if you have a dog for a while and then you have a baby you know it's kind of like a new addition and the dog doesn't really like it [noise] 'cause it' g- it's getting all the attention you know 

289.67 291.04 B: (( yeah i thi- i think )) 

292.37 295.60 B: i think it goes back to the personality of the dog 

296.40 297.38 B: (( um )) 

297.84 300.35 B: i really don't think that 

300.72 305.13 B: it's something that you have to worry about again if if the dog's trained well enough 

305.27 310.43 B: and it just you know it well dogs are like people you know it's the 

311.07 313.53 B: personality that you have to worry about 

314.59 316.91 A: you know they- they're each different 

314.73 315.89 B: but 

317.46 323.32 B: but then again dogs like people get set in their ways and their routines and everything else so

585.64 595.19 A: yeah i mean it's not even a f- it doesn't even really have a shelf life it could happen at any point and one sick fish you know could destroy the entire tank worth 

594.98 596.18 B: yeah
