100.98 102.74 A: [laughter] yep [laughter] 

105.65 106.66 A: yeah 

111.98 117.91 B: you know like i have always defined people in kind of a general way which is kind of a generalization but i guess it's [mn] 

117.47 118.20 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

118.77 120.44 B: [mn] p- people are either 

120.75 122.67 B: [mn] uh self centered 

122.36 123.07 A: (( yeah )) 

122.77 126.19 B: uh materially centered whether in money or things 

125.64 126.85 A: right 

126.36 129.16 B: or god centered which is a very rare phenomenon 

128.80 129.88 A: right 

129.34 135.10 B: and uh or a combination of those three but i mean the one is predominant in there and uh [mn] 

134.52 139.27 A: that's true that's tr- i think i think you're right there um 

137.28 140.75 B: yeah and then there and then there i think 

140.87 154.57 B: i think it uh it's important that if two people are together if you have two givers [mn] you know it's going to work i think you know you you sacri- you know your circle where you draw round your feet has expanded and you think about that other person what can i do for that person today 

147.67 148.74 A: (( mm mm )) 

154.67 169.10 B: uh spiritually mentally physically [lipsmack] and then you do something for them to to benefit them and no if you love someone [mn] you know inherently what they what they would like as a gift let's say 

159.35 160.23 A: yes 

160.24 161.24 A: yeah 

162.21 163.00 A: yeah 

168.91 170.03 A: yeah 

169.62 181.78 B: you don't just buy them a leaf blower or a [laughter] what they're but you know inherently generally you know you because y- you want to know you you you like become like microscope you wanna know about that person [mn] so i think that [noise] 

171.53 173.00 A: [laughter] 

173.66 175.06 A: oh [laughter] 

179.56 186.06 A: yeah yeah yeah because you 'cause you're interested in them and so e- eventually you'll find you'll find out you know pretty soon yeah 

183.55 184.49 B: yeah 

184.59 185.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

185.48 190.09 B: yeah real love what is real love anyway [sigh] love i- i can love somebody from a distance 

188.98 190.40 A: (( mm )) 

190.24 201.29 B: i don't have t- i don't have to touch them i can love them from a distance so [mn] uh you know what i'm everybody has different definitions and that's my definition i think if you stop and think oh wait a minute 

190.43 191.73 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

192.49 193.55 A: yeah 

193.67 194.75 A: (( mm ))

265.46 277.28 B: [mn] and i was married thirty five years and now i'm having trouble in my marriage but this this woman i was married to very good to me treated me very good and i'm faced with the fact of with being selfish or not being selfish you know 

276.97 277.99 A: yeah 

277.39 278.55 B: what should i do 

278.70 281.32 B: and h- and how can i turn my back on my best friend [noise]

289.94 290.76 B: yeah 

292.09 297.27 A: i'm not like things so like you know even um you know 

297.37 303.91 A: turning one's back on them you know it becomes a pretty hard thing because it's almost like turning your back on a whole chunk of your life 

300.57 301.47 B: yes 

303.27 304.61 B: that's right 

304.02 307.45 A: and especially the more time goes by then it means 

305.96 306.84 B: uh-huh 

307.62 314.97 A: saying well look if that chapter is and it's not just a chapter because it's like a whole major chunk right you know is is is over 

312.63 313.86 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

314.66 315.54 B: yes 

315.13 317.70 A: and that that's a big big big deal 

317.31 318.66 B: it's very hard 

317.81 325.99 A: oh of course i mean you know like when you're a teenager or whatever you've you can quickly fall in and out of love you know very quickly and 

322.43 323.60 B: (( mhm yes )) 

325.38 327.41 B: yeah love equals passion uh 

327.03 328.43 A: yeah you know 

327.47 329.65 B: but it doesn't really you know [laughter] [mn] 

328.66 333.20 A: yeah you know at at that level you know that's pretty much like what it is mm 

331.48 336.97 B: in fact i think uh passion and uh love are antagon- antagonistic tendencies 

337.12 341.06 B: in some in some ways you know we we when the dictionary's confused you know 

340.89 341.72 A: yes 

341.15 343.60 B: we make love do we really [lipsmack] 

343.08 344.38 A: [laughter] 

344.05 345.81 B: what are we really making 

345.21 346.25 A: [laughter] 

345.94 355.46 B: wh- when our blood pressure is high so i always i always say love and passion are antagonistic [lipsmack] tendencies not always but i think in general it's true no 

347.54 348.80 A: [laughter] 

350.86 351.88 A: yeah 

354.53 369.49 A: they can be and well certainly society doesn't help any because society sort of presents us with this uh you know oh you can get the women or you can get the men if isn't th- well um you have the reality t._v. shows you know 

361.03 363.86 B: yeah yeah mhm 

365.07 367.09 B: mhm mhm 

367.43 368.47 B: it's easy t- 

368.69 372.60 B: it's easy it's easy to make money if you take people's minds down 

372.45 375.56 A: yes yes yes well well that's true 

372.88 376.29 B: [laughter] it's hard to make money if you're elevating them 

375.70 378.57 A: well that that that is true [laughter] 

377.04 381.78 B: [laughter] higher you know uh but but it's easy to make money with that stuff 

381.42 382.44 A: yeah 

381.86 392.92 B: and that's where you know i d- i think that's a lot of it and that's what sells [lipsmack] and uh unfortunately as it may be of course we live in a society [sigh] that uh very few of us know our next door neighbors' names 

385.42 386.37 A: yeah 

392.42 394.39 A: well that is true too yes 

393.72 403.06 B: uh this collective uh idea is is almost absent uh here uh th- [mn] s- not completely but [lipsmack] it's sad but true in all 

401.13 405.69 A: yeah it's it's like this is one of those you know m- um 

404.42 405.78 B: are you european 

405.85 408.22 A: no i'm not i'm i'm african

415.98 419.54 B: (( yeah stories you know old ernest hemingway ))
