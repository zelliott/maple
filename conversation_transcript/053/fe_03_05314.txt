370.53 371.64 B: (( [noise] [noise] that's cool )) 

374.29 385.86 A: um so we'd sit there and there'd be like thirty forty people sitting around watching it germany's a different country they don't have quite the pub [noise] pub scene as [laughter] england so the [lipsmack] 

382.46 383.31 B: right 

384.26 393.37 B: right yeah all of europe just seems to differentiate so much when you when you go from country to country especially the the the television you know and stuff but [noise] um 

393.27 403.37 B: brou- that brought me to a a topic uh the basketball games here they actually showed at movie theaters um on you know the big screens there you know direct from t._v. but 

403.23 414.41 B: just on the huge screens and they'd sell it out and have little parties and all yeah all during the the march madness tournaments and a few years ago when we when michigan state was going for 

407.23 408.29 A: really 

414.35 425.97 B: the national championship and they you know they got it uh they that was just a crazy madhouse i mean everybody was having t._v. watching parties over this of this basketball game you know

448.06 450.42 B: do they get televised at all as far as 

449.67 461.12 A: a bit [noise] a bit their [noise] games sell [noise] quite a bit [noise] they're like actually the big team in albany 'cause [noise] a lot of the the new jersey the new jersey uh devil's guys came came through this town [noise] 

459.93 460.98 B: (( oh okay )) 

461.28 463.58 A: yeah so a lot of [noise] 

462.09 470.51 B: oh cool we have the we have the red wings of course in detroit and then the grand rapids team which is another s- smaller city in in the west side of our of the state 

470.10 471.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

470.47 477.76 B: they uh they're the farm club for them and occasionally they're on like public public access kind of television you know or or uh 

475.06 476.17 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

477.78 482.19 B: or like uh t._v._s. type stations you know the college stations and stuff 

481.75 482.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

482.49 492.21 B: so occasionally during during the winter months when there's nothing else really to do i'll watch m._t._v. and catch a few of their minor league games and you get to see some up and coming guys so 

484.36 485.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

487.14 487.73 A: (( [noise] )) 

488.39 489.37 A: mhm 

490.32 491.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

492.07 493.31 A: (( [noise] nice )) 

493.36 502.20 A: yeah [noise] see uh [noise] and the funny thing is i i don't actually get [laughter] to watch too much sports right now because uh [noise] i don't have a television so [laughter] 

501.56 502.51 B: oh wow 

502.33 503.99 A: yeah so i don't get 

502.82 505.77 B: what- whatever you catch at the pubs or the parties huh wow 

505.20 510.77 A: [noise] yeah exactly [noise] but it's been interesting uh uh hearing about the yankees 

510.77 521.60 A: mostly 'cause uh the yankees i guess are in the terrible losing streak so everybody here has been kind of bummed about that [laughter] you still watch though [laughter] 

518.93 520.16 B: yeah 

521.67 528.62 A: and i don't even bother i used to be a nets fan but i don't bother watching them because you know they're not they're no good [laughter] 

528.36 529.56 B: yeah 

529.06 532.15 A: i don't think they've ever uh they haven't had a good season in a long time 

532.42 537.76 A: [noise] except the subway series that's when all of new york was pretty excited about that [noise] 

535.33 542.42 B: yeah exactly but the inter league play is is a very uh interesting idea especially when you have two teams in your state you know 

542.34 543.36 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

542.67 556.65 B: the tigers on t._v. you know they get they get the san diego padres on the west coast or somebody you know somebody else that is just as bad as [laughter] the tigers which is pretty hard to do they they've got they're going for the worst record in baseball away from the new york nets here this year 

552.10 552.89 A: (( [laughter] )) 

556.36 557.56 A: (( [laughter] really )) 

556.58 559.69 B: they got they got a maybe a forty one season so 

559.43 561.10 A: uh-huh wow 

560.89 566.97 B: but their t._v. ratings have not been that great 'cause they really don't have a lot to play for at this point already in the season so 

565.14 565.90 A: [laughter] 

568.35 571.86 A: yeah i think mets fans are used to watching the mets lose so 

571.97 574.39 A: uh i'm not sure how the ratings [laughter] are doing [noise] 

574.39 587.24 B: [noise] that must be tough in a team where you've got an owner that spends all that money and gets all that money from like comcast and and uh all the t._v. deals that he does do [noise] uh that's how he can afford to pay so much as far as the payroll you know 

574.61 575.35 A: but [noise] 

586.94 589.74 A: yeah they they have a pretty high payroll don't they the mets 

589.40 595.20 B: they've got like one guy that's better than the whole pittsburgh pirates payroll i believe so 

594.02 595.22 A: jeeze [laughter] 

595.66 599.89 B: it's uh that guy is not afraid to dig [laughter] into his pockets steinbrenner you know
