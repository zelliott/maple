55.45 56.33 A: (( no )) 

61.37 62.28 A: mhm 

62.30 66.43 A: i would probably go uh probably 

66.47 68.74 A: spain portugal 

69.06 70.47 B: [mn] why there 

70.44 76.11 A: uh i've seen reports of uh retired americans they 

76.32 80.42 A: have like these little tiny little communities there 

79.69 82.17 B: oh like an ex patriot community 

82.00 84.68 A: yeah and uh they um 

84.91 87.83 A: you know they retire there and have kind of a 

88.13 90.43 A: lifestyle that um 

90.93 94.46 A: you know looks pretty pretty good uh 

94.12 96.38 B: yeah a a million bucks 

96.53 105.88 B: invested at uh let's say even three percent interest uh what's that uh is that thirty thousand that's thirty thousand a year without ever touching the principal 

105.05 107.90 A: (( mhm )) 

106.87 107.61 B: that's 

107.71 112.74 B: [mn] you could pro- i mean i don't see i don't know how far money would you know go in those places 

112.85 118.70 B: i mean you know technically if you wanted to live in the united states you could live for thirty grand a year but 

118.86 126.37 B: i let's see i don't know [mn] i don't know i'd i'd have to i'd i don't know a million bucks never to come back 

126.95 134.38 B: oh you know you'd never see your well you i couldn't say you'd never your family and friends again i guess they could always come and visit you 

134.31 136.25 A: (( yeah [mn] yeah )) 

134.64 141.69 B: uh but [lipsmack] i don't know uh let's see [mn] i don't know you'd have to give up uh you know 

141.73 148.59 B: you know like if your parents or grandparents passed away or brother or sister you wouldn't be able to go to the funeral i mean 

148.53 149.83 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

149.23 155.97 B: there's a there's a lot to it and uh i guess i i and my first thought was [mn] 

156.33 162.31 B: you know mexico or you know some place like that 'cause you know let's say the cost of living is pretty damn cheap in these areas 

162.47 167.77 B: uh but the problem is is you know the health care and the the security side of it is 

168.12 178.10 B: uh pretty horrid so i i would say if i had to go to mexico or uh a third world country probably not uh 

178.38 185.75 B: because if you could never come back i mean if you could come back for to to see a doctor or you know you know you're allowed to come back a week a year 

179.25 180.92 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

186.02 189.87 B: i'd probably be up for it but uh 

190.01 193.29 B: never come back for a million bucks 

194.18 196.16 B: it's not like a million bucks buys 

196.57 200.80 B: everything nowadays ten million probably but a million i don't know 

200.83 203.58 A: yeah well you know i 

204.17 210.34 A: spain and portugal or um even canada people can drive up to canada 

209.84 213.66 B: uh it's too cold up there [laughter] i'm a [laughter] 

212.43 216.72 A: well yeah you know i used to live in seattle so 

216.20 225.07 B: oh okay so i i grew up on phoenix and lived in las vegas and then moved to new mexico so i'm pretty used to warm and dry so 

217.79 218.57 A: (( [laughter] )) 

224.21 230.88 A: yeah and and i'm the type of person that um i believe in um more natural health 

230.92 234.97 A: care uh i mean i understand if you have a serious 

235.04 243.13 A: [cough] medical you know need that most places around the world you know do have 

243.34 244.53 A: you know 

243.86 251.65 B: well yeah i i mean uh my brother uh we were down in mexico and we were riding motorcycles and he fell off the bike and he needed to get stitches 

251.78 258.64 B: and uh went to a doctor in mexico and got you know it was like three or four stitches in his chin 

258.46 259.47 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

258.85 260.98 B: but he ended up with a staph infection 

260.92 262.15 A: yeah 

261.55 267.49 B: which you know you know he was sick for you know a couple of weeks and you know all that stuff so 

267.70 270.03 B: (( uh i i [mn] )) 

270.53 276.35 B: now let's see i don't know i hadn't i hadn't given it much thought to europe i don't know can you live in italy for 

277.74 279.06 B: [sigh] [mn] 

278.25 288.74 A: probably some towns you could definitely live uh there was one town where the average age is a hundred years old um just because of the lifestyle is so 

285.55 286.37 B: wow 

288.58 293.69 A: eat so healthy and it's not as stressed so 

292.56 298.42 B: wow well yeah i i suppose if i had a million bucks and never had to work again i'd i'd be pretty stress free 

298.24 299.38 A: [laughter] 

298.95 311.62 B: but uh uh let's see a million bucks you see that's the hard thing to get around is is a million bucks sounds like a lot of money but [lipsmack] let's see i make seventy a year now 

312.75 317.59 B: (( so what's that [mn] what is that that i guess that's )) 

318.17 319.90 B: (( that's seventy )) 

320.01 323.87 B: well i guess i'm i'm gonna make a million bucks between here and the end of the my life 

323.93 325.50 B: so i don't see 

326.64 334.76 B: if i invested it and did all the right things with it i guess i could make it milk out so i guess to me the the big thing would be 

331.32 332.86 A: (( [noise] )) 

334.77 346.14 B: uh the lifestyle i mean you know you do have a lot of freedom and uh you know i mean [mn] we live we're relatively safe meaning crime wise there's not a 

336.47 337.49 A: right 

346.35 350.22 B: uh i mean unless you venture into the wrong parts of town here 

350.52 353.20 B: likely not be a victim of uh 

353.22 356.80 B: you know a phy- a physical crime i mean you might you know 

353.88 354.95 A: yeah 

356.82 358.34 B: have your car stolen 

356.90 365.31 A: well [mn] the the thing is [mn] why do people come to the u. s. and live and o- one of the most um 

365.74 377.01 A: most reasons is for economic uh growth and it used to be that okay political or religious oppression and okay people came over here for 

370.44 371.34 B: right 

377.07 383.02 A: those things but the majority of people today they they don't see a way to get out of their 

382.96 396.34 A: you know poverty or their situation or the class system and and uh otherwise they love it in their own country they they they love the people they love the culture they're used to it they you know acclimated to 

384.73 385.75 B: right 

390.39 391.20 B: right 

396.51 404.13 A: um you know kind of the things the the silliness that uh we would think that happens in other countries there 

404.38 409.41 A: they think you know uh we have a lot of silly things like people getting sued over 

409.48 412.49 A: (( you know a hat falling down somebody tripping over it i don't [laughter] )) 

411.82 426.15 B: well i i work for an insurance company and well aware of [laughter] that uh yeah i guess i guess uh technically uh i suppose if you went up to your av- average uh immigrant and said here's a million bucks they they would be gone 

426.33 428.75 B: back home so fast you know [mn] 

427.89 429.24 A: (( mm mhm )) 

428.82 430.66 B: they they wouldn't even bother to pack 

430.49 431.42 A: right 

430.77 442.35 B: uh i i guess so for me [mn] you know economically i because i'm not worried about my economic future that's [mn] not necessarily as as 

442.42 444.54 B: (( strong of a pull for me )) 

443.67 445.78 A: right demanding 

445.24 449.55 B: uh except you know if it was five million or ten million yeah i i i 

449.58 454.91 B: i would make uh uh a hesitation there but the other thing is there's a lot of things that uh 

455.35 455.91 B: (( [mn] )) 

456.06 462.20 B: a lot of people don't don't take i mean they take for granted is that in uh some countries 

461.75 462.81 A: mhm 

462.21 467.97 B: uh if you're an ex patriot you can't work you're not allowed to have uh employment 

467.39 468.71 A: (( mhm mm )) 

468.34 474.66 B: uh so let you know let's say [mn] uh horror of horrors uh you 

474.77 483.53 B: go to australia and you take your million bucks and you buy in to a restaurant or something and it fails and now you've got no money 

480.58 481.61 A: mhm 

483.57 485.13 B: you can't work there 

485.66 488.93 B: uh and you can't come back 

488.94 491.88 A: yeah yeah and and there's 

491.89 496.46 A: you know people here that invest in businesses and lose their shirt and are 

495.89 496.94 B: yeah 

496.39 508.56 A: and bankrupt and pay high interest rates forever and so i think everywhere you go if if you're intellige- general intelligence level if it is um [laughter] 

499.59 500.45 B: yeah 

505.00 505.97 B: right 

508.66 512.83 A: substandard so to speak y- you're gonna be foolish anywhere you go 

512.56 514.46 B: right yes but 

513.13 514.39 A: so 

514.85 517.73 B: but uh a fool and his money are soon parted 

517.46 530.26 A: right and i i think there are if you're safe and in in your mind you know there are ways to kind of secure your little lifestyle without you know 

523.75 524.91 B: yeah 

530.45 531.55 B: yeah 

530.95 533.19 A: selling the wife and kids 

533.75 541.03 B: that's true i suppose if you if you lived yeah well i you know it's funny i'm saying if you lived conservatively but the fact is that you've moved 

540.84 550.30 B: you know across the world you you've you've taken a risk that ninety nine percent of americans would never even contemplate 

542.07 543.09 A: right 

550.24 561.80 B: i mean uh i was reading somewhere something about statistics about people and the percentage of people that never move farther than fifty miles from their childhood home 

561.21 562.19 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

561.89 569.16 B: are i- it's just astronomical it's i i forget what it was i mean obviously that's changing all over the united states uh 

569.14 580.33 B: uh you know [mn] when uh when nowadays it's kinda like you go to college and even if you go to a local college a lot of people end up taking jobs straight out of college taking them somewhere else so 

580.43 581.40 B: uh 

580.50 590.49 A: yeah that's true um and you see the culture in america where the houses are you know manufactured uh a lot of materials and everything is built 

590.84 599.96 A: for the economy where you're not stable uh you're not gonna be p- put you're not gonna stay in a house thirty forty years it's just not the k- 

598.93 599.90 B: right
