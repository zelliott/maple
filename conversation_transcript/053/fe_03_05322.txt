481.76 485.42 B: so so is that part of the game special golf game 

485.65 486.68 A: is what 

485.74 490.46 B: or or is it just uh is that uh oh so that particular thing uh 

491.30 495.66 B: happens to be in a famous game like tournament 

495.33 507.26 A: it was there's um four majors they call them four major tournaments just like in tennis there's a coup- i think there's also the grand slam the four main events or something three or four so they have the same thing same type of thing in golf 

498.58 499.63 B: okay 

503.74 505.01 B: oh okay 

506.71 513.94 B: [mn] okay so that is uh on on many many kind of news not just n._b._c. news the one that i watched last night 

512.17 520.05 A: yeah that was that was you're right i think n._b._c. had the ri- airing rights so n._b._c. was uh the station that was showing the tournament 

517.13 519.12 B: ooh i see okay 

519.32 523.76 B: okay so so he's as good as uh uh tiger woods 

523.64 534.83 A: he used to be in his day uh he's older now and he plays in the senior league too so they were making a big deal about it because he he's you know he's an older guy and he had a really great first round and second round 

530.26 531.31 B: (( [sigh] ooh )) 

533.42 534.63 B: (( but ))
