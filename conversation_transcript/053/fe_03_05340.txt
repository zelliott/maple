46.25 48.74 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

49.61 50.86 B: yeah i had a

53.37 54.33 A: yeah 

55.12 56.45 A: mhm 

55.82 59.11 B: we actually had to put her asleep like a year ago because 

58.96 60.80 A: mhm 

59.26 61.80 B: she just wasn't doing well like falling down stairs 

63.72 75.77 A: i used to have uh tropical fish when i was little a- and goldfish but it just uh you know if you if you travel you know what do you do with them you know so 

67.58 68.82 B: (( and all that but huh )) 

74.75 79.60 B: [laughter] yeah you can't really like feed them while you're away 

78.73 84.09 A: yeah and you can't pu- ah you can't exact- there's not a pet hotel for goldfish so 

83.38 84.22 B: [laughter] 

85.09 88.54 A: [laughter] a-and i don't and i don't think you can take them on the plane either so 

85.24 86.71 B: (( yeah and i i had mhm )) 

89.50 90.90 B: i had fish when i was 

89.89 92.60 A: they might get mistaken for airline food i guess 

92.37 93.75 B: [laughter] 

94.03 98.12 B: i had fish when i was younger too and it just got really expensive just like 

97.71 99.54 A: (( mhm )) 

98.44 103.09 B: to have like a big tank and then some of the fish were really expensive i was surprised about that 

103.51 109.67 B: 'cause they're just fish but i guess you have to like go like really far to find some of the tropical fish 

112.02 117.79 A: yeah but uh yeah i think it's uh it's different i mean if you ha- 

117.88 125.03 A: i gue- you know like it's i think people are busier than they used to be so it's hard to find time to spend with the pets too 

121.84 122.77 B: yeah 

125.58 127.77 B: yeah it's really strange like um 

127.76 133.49 B: my brother's just got married and he and his wife both have a had dogs before they met 

129.52 131.07 A: hm 

133.46 143.11 B: and now like they have two dogs you know as a married couple and it's really weird that like the dogs became their children kind of 'cause they're not ready for kids yet or 

143.26 145.45 B: they're just too busy for kids i guess 

144.85 146.66 A: mhm 

146.11 149.44 B: and it's kind of it's kind of fun to go over to their house 'cause 

149.54 153.15 B: they really do treat their jo- dogs like children but their dogs aren't spoilt so 

154.56 155.91 B: (( it's good i guess )) 

158.07 162.77 A: yeah there was a guy w- i work with he uh has 

162.87 170.42 A: snakes and cats and dogs and yeah i don't know how he how he has time to take care of them all but 

170.94 184.22 B: yeah yeah but you know it's like dogs are well i think dogs are really like stress relieving like when i come home from work it's really nice to if there was a dog there just like pet a dog i don't know why it's just 

183.87 186.39 A: yeah yeah dogs are a lot better than cats 

185.89 189.08 B: really nice [laughter] yeah i definitely agree about that 

186.66 188.66 A: (( i don't i cats are annoying )) 

188.75 191.20 A: you know i once had a roommate that had cats 

191.25 193.20 A: and and uh 

192.38 203.87 B: i don't understand why people like i mean some cats are nice but they kind of just stay out of your way and sometimes they're really mean to you but i don't understand why you would want that in your house i 

205.16 206.97 B: don't know probably like having a yeah 

205.94 208.66 A: well dogs are a lot smarter too and uh 

210.13 216.82 A: and i once in college the g- uh guy across the hall from me kept snakes and we used to watch him uh 

217.02 222.59 A: [laughter] it was the big event in our dorm to uh to go and wat- watch him feed mice to the snake [sigh] 

222.48 223.66 B: [laughter] 

223.93 226.02 B: yeah that would be really cool to see 

227.58 229.90 A: but snakes aren't very bright either 

230.00 235.46 A: and the mo- the mouse would run across its his nose and everything and it wouldn't pay any attention to it 

235.30 236.63 B: oh wow 

237.68 239.78 B: it's so weird 

240.58 242.79 B: where did you go to school 

242.12 244.00 A: uh maryland 

243.57 244.91 B: university of maryland 

244.31 246.02 A: yeah 

245.04 247.20 B: (( oh that's where my brother goes to school )) 

246.93 250.79 A: yeah well i went a long time ago where do you go to where did you go to school 

250.13 252.83 B: yeah uh swarthmore 

251.93 253.99 A: oh that's a that's a very good school 

253.86 255.19 B: yeah w- [noise] 

256.05 257.92 B: it's rough but whatever 

259.77 261.71 A: yeah 

261.73 264.79 A: (( yeah i you know you know i i guess enough p- )) 

264.84 267.67 A: some you know i guess also you know pets 

267.81 274.41 A: you know people f- feed their pets i mean there are people starving around the world and and there you know there are pets 

275.02 277.26 B: yeah yeah i definitely 

276.07 283.52 A: pets eat food and i i guess some people object to them for those reasons it probably wouldn't bother me too much but 

282.97 286.48 B: yeah i think most people just aren't motivated enough to 

283.55 284.35 A: (( [laughter] )) 

286.71 294.99 B: find a cause that's worthwhile that find some kind of causes where they can invest some time and money other than like 

295.63 299.99 B: something worthwhile where th- yeah basically they'd rather choose a pet 

301.36 306.49 A: [mn] you know my brother had he had hamsters and chameleons he had some 

306.55 307.91 A: interesting pets 

308.29 311.70 A: of course when they got loose in the house it wasn't so interesting but 

311.62 312.46 B: (( over you know )) 

314.02 315.09 A: (( but um )) 

316.45 318.32 A: (( yeah )) 

318.78 323.14 A: well [laughter] i think we've pretty much exhausted the topic of pets [laughter] 

322.22 329.45 B: [laughter] yeah other than like we both don't like cats i don't know what else to talk about 

330.71 336.10 A: yeah yeah a lot of people are allergic to cats too that's another thing 

335.60 348.22 B: yeah actually i didn't know this but last summer one of my friends lived in an apartment just for the summer and he was allergic to cats and apparently they leave everywhere 

348.06 350.46 B: which is like just this weird 

350.27 364.51 B: dust kind of and it like sticks to the walls and it sticks to like floors and carpet and he was he would walk into the room and even though there wasn't a cat there any more all this was like stuck on the walls and floors but like you couldn't 

364.77 370.16 B: like i couldn't tell but like when he would walk into the room he would start having adverse reactions which 

370.84 375.79 B: really i think it's kind of extreme for someone with allergies but i was kind of surprised about 

378.29 388.62 A: yeah there is always and another thing is a lot of people don't take care of their pets very well and they you know they let them run loose and and uh 

389.20 396.68 A: and uh you know there's there are some pla- some cities there are stray packs of dogs and things like that and uh 

394.55 396.75 B: that yeah oh 

396.58 405.00 A: actually where i live you know there we have a lot of woods and if i had a pet i'd be wor- there's you know rabies and things like that that's another thing to worry about 

404.66 408.61 B: yeah yeah when i was growing up we always had to watch out for ticks on our dogs just in case 

409.75 416.91 B: it's interesting what's interesting though as well you mentioned the stray dogs i went to chile to do um 

409.78 411.49 A: yeah 

417.53 420.86 B: observing 'cause 'cause i do astronomy research 

420.59 422.35 A: mhm 

421.27 422.96 B: so i went to this town 

423.04 435.10 B: and like in the town you like walked through the park and there'd just be like a pack of stray dogs and they just like they all sleep together in the in the parks like during the daytime and scavenge food together 

435.16 436.96 B: it's kind of different like how 

437.10 438.43 B: uh pets 

438.93 441.16 B: well how people take care of their pets in like other 

442.58 444.52 B: countries i thought that was really interesting 

444.74 453.14 A: yeah well probably a lot of people also and another thing i was thinking about pets people i guess people like sometimes use them for substitutes for human i mean 

453.19 458.90 A: sort of inter- they'd rather interact with their pets than you know the uh than humans [laughter] 

458.74 460.00 B: yeah 

459.24 465.63 A: uh you know you you have those p- cases where people leave tons of money to pets or when they die or or 

465.25 467.26 B: yeah or they do crazy things 

466.11 469.39 A: they bury them in pets cemeteries and 

468.37 474.65 B: yeah they do crazy things like dress them up in costumes and treat them like they're children [laughter] that's kind of weird 

476.49 480.75 A: yeah well i'm trying to think about more things about pets [laughter] but 

477.83 478.82 B: (( yeah yeah mhm )) 

480.79 484.87 A: i'm really straining my brain here so you're into astronomy 

484.70 486.28 B: yep 

486.02 489.76 A: yeah i'm i uh do computer intrusion detection at the pentagon 

490.20 492.46 B: oh really wow 

490.80 493.86 A: yeah that's an interesting job 

493.25 496.53 B: that [laughter] sounds like sounds pretty hard 

495.41 497.94 A: crazy place but it's an interesting job 

499.08 501.45 B: were you there on september eleventh 

500.22 506.37 A: [laughter] oh yeah yeah yeah um but fortunately i was on the other side of the building 

502.02 503.82 B: you really 

506.37 507.31 B: yeah 

506.61 514.54 A: and then when the plane hit we didn't find out about it until three minutes afterwards when somebody's mother phoned and said the pentagon's been hit 

514.78 522.62 A: and then i uh we've ma- i made sure all the people that work for me were had evacuated and um uh 

520.52 521.47 B: uh-huh 

523.22 534.08 A: and out of my area i was like one of the last people out and when i got out of the building i ran like hell [laughter] yeah well my wife was out of the county i- in the bahamas 

528.49 530.28 B: yeah 

533.95 543.96 A: so uh she won some cheesy radio station prize she she was with her sister there so i had to get home b- because there would be nobody home to let the kids in 

534.08 535.36 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

543.99 545.71 A: from school so [laughter] 

546.24 547.84 A: but but um 

547.00 549.08 B: well in like uh 

549.12 551.86 B: did your wife have any trouble getting back yeah was 

551.03 553.76 A: i- uh yeah she did actually so 

553.90 564.38 A: but you know that's uh i was i was back at the pentagon that night because i got my mother to watch the kids but we had you know we had work to do and such but it was uh 

555.47 556.90 B: she 

560.72 562.35 B: mhm 

564.46 566.26 A: interesting experience 

566.44 574.13 A: bu- but they fortunately they you know they've increased the security there a lot i feel pretty safe there in fact i'd probably feel safer there than [laughter] 

566.60 567.65 B: yeah 

574.17 576.43 A: than other places you know they they 

576.94 580.98 B: yeah especially like since uh i was i was kind of worried um 

581.10 584.12 B: when was it that the fall maybe 

584.19 587.05 B: when the sniper was around in dc 

587.64 591.29 B: 'cause my brother was like down at the university of maryland and 

590.66 591.69 A: mhm 

592.14 597.31 B: well he's been to he told me he had been to a lot of the places where people had been shot so 

597.83 599.89 B: i mean in some s- some respects they're
