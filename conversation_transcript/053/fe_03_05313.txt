98.88 99.80 A: (( yeah )) 

104.95 110.98 B: and um one of the reasons he did it was all the uh the chicks and all these english nurses down there [noise] 

105.11 106.86 A: (( all right )) 

110.98 121.00 B: he would get out there for the games and uh you know and watched rugby games and of course gotta have a have a few beers uh with the guys afterwards but 

111.24 112.60 A: [laughter] 

120.86 123.20 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

122.15 125.45 B: that's um yeah american football's definitely a um 

126.01 133.80 B: a uh unique phenomenon mostly to america i know there's some european professional football leagues i'm not really sure how popular they are 

133.22 133.97 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

134.99 140.85 A: yeah i don't understand how you guys have like world champion uh 

141.24 148.22 A: you know or even like the world series for baseball it's not the world series nobody else in the world is playing [laughter] 

147.55 153.32 B: [laughter] well this is it's america though that's our uh world centric view of ourself um 

153.45 155.44 A: this is true yeah 

153.82 157.72 B: uh so many americans actually believe the world uh does revolve around us 

158.12 159.91 A: yeah yeah 

159.26 165.66 B: hence we have the world series of football world series of you know in the world series of baseball and of 

166.40 172.32 B: course the super bowl which is professed to be the world's uh you know greatest football team 

173.07 175.56 A: okay yeah this is true 

173.25 174.13 B: (( uh uh )) 

174.62 176.25 B: it's uh very um 

176.80 185.26 B: very uh centric only on us and they're really truly encompassing the world i mean yeah it's baseball's really popular in cuba and some other caribbean pl- 

185.72 190.81 B: island nations but beyond that [mn] and japan of course but beyond that it's um 

191.31 194.17 B: not too terribly popular elsewhere [noise] 

193.74 201.57 A: [noise] [noise] yeah it's almost dead but uh i mean when i grew up in south africa and spent most of my life there and uh 

201.62 207.14 A: [lipsmack] they're starting to get a following there but soccer [noise] cricket [noise] rugby 

207.99 210.59 A: will always rule as far as that goes 

211.62 212.64 B: yeah 

211.66 213.83 A: no one else is [noise] interested 

213.58 218.87 B: there's like already quite a few uh south african rhodesian ex pats up here in the dallas area 

213.94 215.08 A: yeah 

219.63 228.18 A: there are yeah i mean i know a couple but i heard there was many many thousands but i just haven't come across very many i don't know why 

228.51 232.46 B: (( well they're out there u- uh definitely i used to go to rugby games locally [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

233.39 238.03 A: yeah we met this uh girl one day and she was joining a uh 

238.90 243.79 A: a rugby league for girls and she went home and told her parents that she was the team's hooker 

243.91 245.86 B: [laughter] 

244.14 249.99 A: and they were less than impressed [laughter] so er 

249.64 256.33 B: well my old uh boss incorporates he had a group playing rugby when he uh sus- sustained some pretty severe knee damage 

256.56 261.13 B: [noise] which required a few surgeries afterwards it like e- ended his rugby days a 

257.09 257.99 A: yeah 

261.21 264.34 B: very rough game uh they definitely uh 

265.21 267.50 B: definitely uh go after each other 

268.32 271.97 A: yeah and limited padding which makes it a whole lot more fun 

270.20 271.13 B: yeah 

272.34 273.98 A: but uh you 

274.02 287.68 A: know the whole deal on f- the other thing i don't get about any sort of sports on t._v. here is the game that you're watching is not catered towards the crowd that's watching it's catered towards the t._v. audience you 

286.78 288.30 B: right 

287.69 300.49 A: know they stop the game they go to adverts for f- four minutes or whatever and then they come back and [noise] and i'm like man that sucks you know it just kills the game everywhere else in the world they gotta squeeze an advert in at halftime or 

300.58 302.82 A: just completely not have them 

303.08 304.41 A: (( here it's uh [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

303.23 312.38 B: well it's the uh it's a that's a direct result of the insane economics of american professional sports these guys are making twenty or thirty million a year 

312.65 325.24 B: you know plus uh they go out a- and play this thing and and the economics dictate that they um that they have to squeeze in a fair amount of advertisements it makes the uh televis- 

325.57 337.07 B: televising the games worthwhile 'cause they pay so much for those rights same thing's driving the stadium building boom i mean why is it every time they have to go out and insist on building a new three hundred million dollar stadium why is it 

337.00 342.51 B: well we need the you know more bigger sky boxes they gotta have larger corporate uh 

342.96 353.08 B: corporate uh people buying these hundred thousand two hundred thousand a year sky boxes it's all e- economics econ- numbers have to get bigger the stadiums have to get bigger the crowds have to get bigger 

347.03 349.51 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

353.06 358.78 B: uh the commercial rates have to get larger all to sustain this crazy economics of professional sports 

358.62 368.60 B: that's one reason why they don't have professional baseball games any more it's such a pain in the ass but i really enjoy going to a minor league baseball game like when i went you know fort worth they had fort cats over there 

368.66 370.96 A: my boss owns the fort worth cats 

370.64 379.04 B: really wow you know it's extremely ironic 'cause my granddaddy used to play for them back in the nineteen twenties his name was art uh art falem senior 

374.80 375.75 A: really 

379.60 380.49 A: okay [noise] 

379.68 387.69 B: but he played for the cats in the early to mid twenties and he wound up owing a minor league team in [noise] alexandria louisiana called the aces 

387.85 391.13 B: which he owned from the thirties up to about the early fifties 

391.36 397.09 A: yeah it's so amazing yeah i do uh i do a lot of i._t. support for like the cat stuff 

396.49 401.56 B: ah yeah i'm an i._t. guy too unfortunately i'm out of work right now [laughter] [noise] 

397.49 398.47 A: so 

401.15 410.05 A: oh right yeah it's uh it's getting pretty tough out there i uh i was talking to a recruiter yesterday trying to find out just how tough the market is 

410.21 413.60 A: but uh his advice was just for me to 

414.35 419.54 A: keep on smiling and take whatever they give me [laughter] 

418.08 427.87 B: yeah it is pretty tough i just came off my contract with daily investments and they basically like ran out of money on our project and uh so uh myself and two other guys went out the door 

427.91 434.39 B: so i'm taking some time off um to actually go to singapore here uh next month for about a week and 

434.48 440.06 B: other than that i don't have a lot of firm plans [laughter] just send the resumes out and 

440.40 443.03 B: taking care of the the old household here [noise] 

440.42 441.36 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

443.93 449.12 A: the way the economy has gone really does suck but [sigh] you know uh it's 

449.41 461.43 A: hopefully it's going to spring back this recruiter seemed pretty positive that by early next year he says it's better than it was six months ago but in six months time he expects it to be much better than it is now so 

460.09 460.99 B: oh yeah 

461.38 463.13 B: are you a programmer or 

461.54 462.63 A: so that's 

463.35 470.38 A: no i uh do system administration and firewall administration and um just general 

470.44 473.06 A: just admin type network 

473.13 474.72 A: stuff 

473.79 481.30 B: that's basically what i do too second level stuff uh like you know domain account administration back ups restores 

481.51 484.94 A: yeah yeah 

482.87 484.81 B: usually second level b._s. 

486.51 495.37 B: [noise] yeah it's uh baseball has uh definitely changed let me tell you a little story is how ironic my father my grandfather played professional baseball in the nineteen uh teens 

486.63 487.56 A: sorry 

495.62 504.29 B: for the reds and later for chicago cubs and he got kicked out of the minors and eventually worked his way into fort worth in the early twenties playing for the aces for several years 

504.42 513.12 B: but my brother has framed a letter from a guy he played pro baseball with either cincinnati or or the reds back in the in the early nineteen teens 

513.34 522.72 B: and the letter is dated like in nineteen forty forty nine and in the letter they're just commenting the guy is commenting just incredulously how can you believe these salaries 

522.64 532.34 B: can he believe [laughter] what they're paying [laughter] these guys today in baseball and every time i read that at my brother's house i just chuckle if the guy could just only see what where it's gone today 

525.97 527.73 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

532.53 538.79 A: yeah it's insane i mean i cannot believe that they're even considering building a new 

538.68 549.05 A: stadium for the cowboys i'm like two billions dollars man i ain't signing no dam bond nothing to be building two billion dollars worth of stadium the cowboys suck and no stadium's gonna fix that 

549.61 558.00 B: [noise] yeah that's just kind of crazy and uh gerry's really uh very sleazy in the way he goes about doing this stuff i always remember several years ago 

550.00 551.30 A: you know but then 

558.39 568.34 B: he was trying to get arlington or irving i'm sorry to uh help fund a uh you know the same big thing at tick stadium and the same time d._a._r._t. was trying to get uh 

568.93 576.10 B: you know financing uh through increasing the sales tax we funded a local frog campaign in irving 

576.04 577.22 A: yeah 

576.11 584.83 B: because if irving went and signed into d._a._r._t. and got the extra half cent they would then be at the top end of what the state says you can assess as sales tax so 

585.30 593.74 B: he spent all this money uh basically trying to shoot down this d._a._r._t. uh referendum you know trying to shoot irving out of joining d._a._r._t. and uh 

593.97 599.89 B: just so he could lead a half a cent sale tax increase for him and his little you know
