22.02 24.80 B: oh maryland uh you got a favorite sports team or what man 

25.70 32.05 A: ah the kings pretty mu- i been i've been watching in uh the finals you know coming up it's uh now and then 

32.48 33.60 A: (( ah )) 

34.70 36.45 A: (( basketball uh i )) 

36.54 41.47 A: i'd rather play football but the the best sport to watch i think is is basketball 

41.65 49.86 B: yeah man i think so too it is it's a pretty good game it's a fast paced game i think that's why it's really caught on like baseball's little bit slower to watch fun to play 

45.16 45.96 A: (( uh uh-huh )) 

49.60 50.51 A: uh-huh 

49.94 59.27 B: you know what i mean but a little bit uh slow and long to watch on t._v. now foot- football's pretty good too but it's just doesn't have that same type of rush that i think that basketball does man 

53.27 54.37 A: real slow 

59.04 62.75 A: (( exactly exactly so you you know what i'm talking about )) 

60.68 61.79 B: yeah 

63.08 67.46 B: um my ah my team was the bulls man when uh when m. j. was here 

66.95 73.96 A: right right i got to s- i got to fucking finally see him in in person and meet him over the he was playing the wizards but ah he's 

73.43 74.42 B: right 

75.45 79.19 A: oh you in chicago too so yeah yeah that's right 

77.78 88.04 B: yeah i've seen him play like a couple of times man i mean nothing nothing like the final or anything like that but i've seen him play in regular season games i- it it was good to see man definitely you know and um 

80.01 82.01 A: and when he was good [laughter] 

86.79 89.28 A: when he was in his prime yeah yeah 

88.84 94.08 B: yeah when when he was in his prime exactly i wish i wish he hadn't quit then but uh 

94.17 105.03 B: but um yeah it was fun to watch him when they used to go on man like everybody in chicago not just me man everybody used to watch i mean like always we'd always watch the games or the playoff or the whole citywide thing 

102.60 103.84 A: (( oh hell yeah )) 

104.49 105.33 A: yeah 

104.79 110.94 B: now the bulls i mean they got this like the nicest stadium the united's one if you've ever been to it i don't know it's the nicest place and 

109.11 113.38 A: but they're like always taken taken from last [laughter] yeah there's 

112.11 116.74 B: yeah and nobody goes to it man huh i mean you know you couldn't pay me to go to a ball game right now 

114.44 115.38 A: (( yeah )) 

116.55 117.76 A: (( yeah )) 

116.83 119.96 B: local sport so i think like you know it kinda depends on 

120.02 123.96 B: you know just a team of how many people actually 

124.61 133.90 B: watch watch i think that has a big thing to do with it you know because you have the people out there who just aren't that hard fans that you know when the team starts doing good suddenly there are fans 

133.67 137.24 A: (( oh yeah there are a lot of fans out there yeah yeah yeah )) 

134.68 135.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

135.53 140.32 B: yeah and they're they fill up the upper deck and everything like that you know so 

139.79 140.70 A: (( uh )) 

140.66 146.45 B: i mean yeah like i i i'm possibly the same way like when the bears were hot you know we were pretty good uh uh a few 

145.34 147.25 A: back in the eighties right 

147.04 156.76 B: yeah a few years back and then uh it was fun to watch but again it all depends on the team if the team's pretty good then definitely everybody watches but if's not it's just like [mn] 

148.11 148.99 A: uh 

150.19 151.42 A: yeah 

157.25 164.78 A: yeah and who's there just aren't teams that it's just best to watch because it's a it's a damn good matchup 'cause you know 

157.91 160.44 B: (( [noise] mhm yeah well )) 

163.97 175.68 B: yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's what the play offs i think are all about you know what i mean where you don't have a like a you know raggy team player like a uh oh like a a a like one of those top teams you have kinda like the best of the best battling it out which makes it a lot more interesting 

174.05 177.50 A: yeah hum- but sometimes it's even though they're still the best 

177.62 178.33 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

177.63 178.89 A: uh 

179.20 185.88 A: it really doesn't go anywhere it's not like kinda it's like like like right now we're with with the the spurs and the spurs are 

186.15 197.72 A: uh yeah right now but it's not that like really exciting to watch i mean the me- the mets are j- everywhere i mean if it was the mets and the kings i i i i that that'd be the game right there with 

189.06 190.45 B: yeah yeah 

197.11 200.65 B: oh yeah that [laughter] for you right definitely you- you're a kings fan man 

200.12 201.27 A: (( the oh yeah )) 

200.66 202.55 B: were you disappointed or what man 

202.72 206.65 A: yeah kinda i [mn] was hoping to see it but 

206.23 207.38 B: yeah 

206.82 210.67 A: yeah yeah i've been watching them and then but 

210.81 213.94 B: so how many hours do you think watch a a week of sports 

212.65 220.82 A: yeah how many hours uh shh four hours i think four hours a week about yeah 

221.69 227.20 B: mm four hours a week yeah i'm probably a little bit lower now well well no and since the finals on probably about two three hours 

226.83 227.89 A: yes 

227.28 236.99 B: but i watch a lot of sports center i think that's like the new trend lot of people watching like the best damned sports show and sports center right now instead of watching the games 'cause it's just such a good uh recap you know 

231.81 233.77 A: (( yeah yeah ))

371.71 373.04 A: right right 

372.11 381.10 B: so those already filled up with other people who knew other people i guess who got there so he was kinda upset man i think and he came late he was one of the last players to come out of baseball man 

380.97 388.56 B: and i was waiting for him to come and uh i was just waiting and waiting and then i was just like man this guy is not going to come or he's went some other way 

388.61 397.44 B: his car's still here so then him and like his brother in law came out you know w- 'bout and hour and half two hours after [laughter] the game and he had a uh versace suit on 

394.22 396.49 A: (( mm )) 

397.40 409.88 B: like a you know [laughter] and sun glasses and his brother in law did too you could to- totally tell it and stuff like that and he was upset and he was just like these guys have got pretty broad shoulders man he's just like bumping shoulders and going through he was signing some autographs [lipsmack] 

399.39 400.38 A: (( [mn] uh )) 

410.41 423.20 B: and then i was like i wanted my ball signed and so i was just waiting waiting and then he came up to me and then he was how am i going to get this guy to sign my ball you know because he was picking some people and you know just like you know kinda make it quick so he came over i'm like 

419.68 420.60 A: uh-huh 

423.69 428.04 B: you know i i don't i'm not mexican man but [laughter] like a spanish man [laughter] 

425.89 429.42 A: maybe just spanish yeah it was fine that's m- [laughter] yeah 

428.07 439.69 B: [laughter] yeah and so you know i might have looked mexican 'cause i'm with the darker skin i got you know shorter hair so he grabbed my ball he signed it and then he said something to me in spanish i just nodded [laughter] yeah 

437.60 438.39 A: [laughter] 

439.73 449.09 A: that's cool that's cool did you think he was corking the ball di- did you think he was corking his bat there in the hole like the mcguire thing mcguire um 

441.31 444.08 B: (( yeah i had definitely yeah i'm and um )) 

447.32 454.55 B: oh no i don't think so man [mn] i don't think so because uh i think he's on steroids everybody in chicago thinks he's on 

453.21 458.91 A: fucking mcguire was on steroids that's but it was like a different form of steroid but i now i know about them 

456.42 459.37 B: yeah it's it was like a you know just like you did 

459.80 466.59 B: he same thing but it wasn't e- exactly an anabolic steroid or whatever it was kinda like a like a supplement 

465.44 470.14 A: it it was like a testosterone type of thing where it gives you something and it but 

468.23 481.44 B: exac- [mn] same thing he knew what he was doing when he was taking those shots but man if you look at sosa before and his old pictures like his old baseball cards man this guy was skinny out of the dominican republic this guy is so cut up like you know 

481.12 490.82 A: well think they were like the l. o. cool jays like the buster ranch you see 'em back in the eighties and i'm like [laughter] you know what i uh-huh he could could have we- yeah he could he could have worked out but 

485.97 488.55 B: (( yeah yeah yeah [noise] )) 

490.69 499.34 B: no man this guy put on so many pounds sosa especially he's so big because i saw him once at a nightclub and he just had like one little like stretch 

491.04 492.06 A: nowadays 

499.35 511.46 B: this guy's huge man he's a big guy he can't be more than like five nine but he's w- i i b- i'd be scared of the man he's that huge he definitely does something steroids but i don't think he was corking his bat 'cause he just looks strong you know what i mean 

500.68 502.95 A: yeah he's been playing football mm 

511.40 512.19 A: (( but )) 

511.44 516.41 B: he just looks like he could do it but i think he he he's used that bat more than once you know what i mean 

516.47 527.03 A: i think b- b- but i i guess that you know they they lose confidence they want to make sure like even though they've got the strength to do this shit i- i- it's like you got you got to go that extra step and that's 

516.62 517.43 B: but it 

523.31 525.73 B: (( exactly i think )) 

526.24 530.92 B: yeah i i've seen the court bad you know i played baseball in high school i i feel 

530.69 543.49 B: it it i it doesn't make that much of a difference it can just you can swing faster with it you know i mean but like you know i think it's a mental thing like oh hell i got to cork that i'm in a drought this is definitely going to help me i think it's like a mental thing for him you know 

534.65 535.65 A: uh-huh 

543.23 544.43 A: yeah he won't 

543.58 549.11 B: and um but man he really got it uh his name run through the mud especially i don't know why he did it you know 

549.00 560.09 A: i compare it to aluminum bats now aluminum bats i mean at first of all it it like when you hit the ball like real hard it fucking vibrates it stings but would it would it guarantee distance 

551.16 552.35 B: yeah 

555.54 556.30 B: yeah 

557.01 558.01 B: yeah 

559.48 571.63 B: do aluminum guarantees distance definitely and that's the aluminum they have other types of alloys out there like um jenex louisville fargo they made one it's i don't know what it is it's jenex bad it's like supposed to be the hardest aluminum 

560.46 561.36 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

571.63 579.97 B: that thing would give you distance that i mean anybody could get hit a home run with a couple of months training but wood bat it is so difficult man to hit with you know 

571.93 573.23 A: (( uh i see )) 

579.89 585.96 A: i i guess it i guess they only want to expand this uh the baseball field [laughter] so they just outlaw 'em it'll 

580.05 581.88 B: it's so diff- yeah 

584.34 595.54 B: yeah ex- exactly yeah they have to they uh there wouldn't be no fun watching aluminum i mean everybody could crank it up but a wood bat like to hit four hundred feet or to hit it over boston i think that's like totally difficult you know 

586.43 587.25 A: make it 

595.14 596.24 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

595.49 599.89 B: yeah definitely if you cork a bat i think it just makes it lighter i think that's so you can swing fa-
