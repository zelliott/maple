18.27 31.44 A: t._v. the other day a joke like about baseball how baseball's a dead sport and i was watching a game just a little bit ago you know about ten minutes ago and you know what it is kind of dead so i can't say baseball's a favorite sport of mine any more i watch less and less 

31.56 37.78 A: of it i'd say basketball the basketball just ended you know so i'm kinda like gearing up for the football season now 

38.24 49.90 B: yeah i know what you're saying i mean well as far as um sports the only sport i really follow and you might think it sounds silly but wrestling i like professional wrestling even though they say it's fake but it's entertaining it keeps me interested but 

49.75 62.07 B: only time i watch baseball or anything like that's like during like the playoffs and world series like for example like how far the yankees when they started going in the pennant race and then going through like the world series and i really get into it but for me to watch a hundred and sixty two games 

62.15 70.38 B: of any sport i couldn't i couldn't do it and basketball is to me it's boring and football's cool i like football especially this football season 

70.56 71.52 B: (( there's um )) 

71.57 76.95 B: the a._f._c. championship a- a._f._c. championship i like that too that's straight but for me to follow 

77.11 83.22 B: a sport besides wrestling for the whole season gets kind of you know what i mean and that was unless 

81.60 82.92 A: mhm mhm 

83.43 93.26 B: you're in a situation where you're betting you know y- you ever go like in these football pools like you'll be at work and people say like put on like two dollars and whoever chooses the most wins

122.65 133.07 A: my mother likes it and i'll be over at her place like sunday night for dinner kind of thing you know and she'll be watching it all day and you know she doesn't even play it i don't know why she likes it but she likes to watch it mhm 

131.61 136.81 B: (( mhm that's interesting because this thing like like gold charm i don't really watch it but i'll be )) 

136.97 148.89 B: like what tiger woods is up to what's he doing and then when had his girl i forgot her name but she tried to play this tournament it was only for men only but she somehow was allowed in or something like that 

147.97 149.56 A: oh yeah yeah 

148.99 162.82 B: so they made a big deal out of it i mean it gets to the big deal was a men's exclusive event then they let her in there but oh golf i mean jeeze but golfers made pretty good money s- was not didn't know how it really worked you know what i mean 

162.22 163.63 A: sure sure

238.92 248.35 B: not that much i mean jesus that's a good quest- 'cause i mean when i'm home you know i watch the professional wrestling so that's like fours hours a week i watch i say wrong 

247.88 250.41 A: mhm ah you already watch that crap 

249.90 256.33 B: yeah i watch it and hey you know you might say it's crap but it's entertaining me it's no different than watching a movie i don't 

250.84 255.01 A: (( [laughter] in )) 

255.28 257.86 A: (( with the minds of america come on )) 

257.00 269.39 B: know maybe i mean it's entertaining 'cause the guys doing a bit of stunts and and believe it or not they do get hurt [laughter] even though it's choreographed it's it's just like dancing you know you know how you watch people dancing like in movies and whatever 

263.27 266.00 A: (( yeah yeah yeah [mn] uh )) 

267.52 268.34 A: yeah 

269.11 270.37 A: mhm mhm 

269.64 279.33 B: it's the same thing for them baseball like they got a game on tonight you know they got yankees and um and tampa bay playing again and yankees will kill them nine to nine to two 

279.18 285.41 B: but watching what any of this i just flip the t._v. real quick nine to two they're beating them beating them up but 

279.37 280.24 A: yeah 

285.50 298.94 B: i i follow the yankees but i won't watch every yankee game but you know if they who's you're favorite baseball team i say yankees they say my football team is and i say i say giants and forty niners raiders like that 

285.53 286.39 A: uh-huh 

295.58 296.41 A: uh-huh 

296.85 297.69 A: uh-huh 

299.10 304.56 B: basketball huh i used to like the celtics but now i'm leaning towards the bulls when jordan was there 

303.02 305.43 A: you used to like the celtics get out 

304.84 312.85 B: but like i said when they when bor- jordan was there you know bulls was doing all right but now well [mn] i mean well i would say that basketball team no more 

312.74 313.60 A: (( okay )) 

313.48 324.15 A: well you know here's the deal i don't like uh [sigh] i don't like professional basketball as much college because college is like integrity to the sport still i mean pro 

323.94 329.81 A: basketball is kinda like pro baseball it's i mean pro baseball can get boring to watch at least if you do it night after night you 

329.29 330.23 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

329.67 332.29 A: (( know the playoffs and everything most of their games are fine )) 

332.10 340.66 A: but uh you know the thing is that it's a money sport and the same with pro basketball where like the teams with the most money and the biggest markets win 

340.45 350.56 A: you know and predominantly not always i know the last series before last you know there was that you know up and coming or not up and coming team but i mean team that you know didn't have the big market share that you know 

350.60 351.60 B: (( mhm right mhm )) 

350.67 360.00 A: that was able to go that far but that's a fluke most people you know even say so and i mean you look at pro basketball it's the same way it's like teams like the lakers that have money i think they 

359.79 374.09 A: a joke the other night something like well you know it's good to see san antonio you know won it uh won the lakers trophy you know for a year you know and so i think it's kind of uh you know bit if a uh uh joke that um you know 

374.08 387.86 A: you have these teams they call themselves competitive and it's sport in a market that really is not sport and doesn't lend itself to competitiveness so i've shied away from watching pro basketball now it's like pretty much just ho- 

387.72 394.85 A: i mean some hockey uh but i mean uh it's pretty much i mean in like winter going into spring college basketball 

394.24 405.32 B: i see what you're saying yeah i heard i don't know but some time i say like someone will like the basketball game like the players will kind of like fix maybe not with the players or maybe the ref might make a 

402.61 403.49 A: mhm 

405.23 406.09 A: (( mhm )) 

405.44 407.82 B: a call that should have been made 

407.45 408.40 A: mhm 

407.84 411.34 B: like was that if it's more moderable they'll just say 

411.55 417.89 B: um they'll just say the knicks versus the lakers if it's more moderable to have that that kind of a fight instead of say 

414.44 415.36 A: mhm 

418.12 421.28 B: some other team that's not really up near the medium market 

420.84 422.16 A: mhm 

421.59 426.60 B: have you noticed over the years it seem like the teams that get the more media markets end up in a 

427.56 432.26 B: you know in a in the final and that you know that the championship you know what i mean but then 

431.29 432.93 A: mhm mhm 

432.34 435.94 B: (( the nets well you got suppose )) 

435.85 436.90 A: mhm 

436.34 441.67 B: and they seem to be pretty up and coming they like the lakers when they had a dynasty or 

441.68 442.94 B: (( the knicks you know )) 

442.88 443.87 A: yeah 

443.31 445.38 B: the knicks weren't really doing nothing 

445.69 458.19 B: except for the seventies when we used to have rolf ray we going way back then but yeah but [lipsmack] i don't know they have college is more exciting 'cause the kids are more hungrier you know when they're more hungry they playing 'cause they want to play to get a scholarship they know if they don't play right they 

453.25 454.14 A: mhm 

457.48 458.51 A: mhm 

457.97 463.90 B: won't be able to score the school but yeah once again the pros is all about money and endorsement 

463.13 477.41 A: oh though i tell you what i do like pro football but i mean like in the fall i think yeah i think uh that's how much of this you know do you watch and i mean in the fall i watch on like weekends for pro football i'll definitely sit down and i'll watch um you know like uh 

464.31 464.98 B: yeah 

465.93 467.56 B: football straight yeah 

473.73 474.55 B: okay 

476.63 479.37 B: (( yeah but there's a it's a part of the game you know )) 

478.47 480.44 A: (( least a couple of games you know and the money )) 

479.39 480.77 B: (( yeah um )) 

480.82 486.74 B: i can't watch every every football game but i'm just saying like the big rivalry yeah i could w- i could sit down 

482.90 483.62 A: uh-huh

497.08 500.83 B: got down there jack was or something like that some of the people 

499.46 502.37 A: [laughter] so you don't really have a home team you cheer 

502.00 508.30 B: no no i mean we even follow the freaking atlantic atlanta falcons they're about two hours from me or

511.80 517.31 B: charlotte jaguars something like that panthers something like that yeah but where you we we where you from 

517.28 520.79 A: um pittsburgh so i'm a steeler steeler fan you know 

518.18 519.65 B: (( pittsburgh oh steeler ))

528.84 529.76 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

530.28 540.64 A: watch one game a week off that you know obviously i watch the steelers and then i may watch like another game on sunday but usually monday night so i mean i may get two to three games now and you know 

540.46 544.83 A: a a week i'd say at least two so you know the average football game's like 

544.79 546.23 A: (( three hours a day so i'm going to watch )) 

546.22 549.78 A: six hours you know maybe nine a week and of course you 

549.76 557.10 A: got college uh football in there too and i may watch an occasional college game but see college football i put in a classification like 

551.78 552.63 B: yeah 

557.08 567.23 A: i think college basketball is fair pretty much but i don't think that you know c- uh pro pro basketball is conversely oddly enough i think that um 

567.55 575.38 A: you know college football is not fair but i think pro football is because pro football's got the draft you know and and you got 

573.59 574.46 B: (( mhm oh )) 

575.32 581.13 A: you know a turnover that keeps it honest you know small teams can come up again even teams in small markets 

581.02 595.04 A: come out of nowhere in a few years you know teams that are just starting up like in the last five ten years you know that they've had uh even that new you know texas team and so forth they they're going to have a chance you know because of the draft the integrity of the draft but you look at like college 

594.94 599.89 A: football it's the powerhouse teams southern games like miami and stuff you know certain teams from 

596.95 597.86 B: uh-huh 

599.01 599.95 B: right
