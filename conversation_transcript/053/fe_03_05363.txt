0.60 1.92 A: hello 

2.65 11.02 B: hi ah i'm i'm calling to talk to you do a survey to ask you ah what your ah thoughts are on minimum wage 

7.07 8.07 A: (( mhm )) 

10.75 12.27 A: okay yeah 

11.66 14.33 B: are you are you interested in talking about that 

13.66 14.62 A: yes 

15.12 16.51 B: all right ah 

16.70 20.71 B: well the the question is should it go up from five fifteen 

21.29 22.56 B: what do you think 

21.93 30.88 A: i think i think it should um i think that um people especially people that work in the service industries they um 

31.41 39.64 A: they they pretty much rely on their wages and they don't get um any of the benefits like the health care and and ah 

39.67 42.61 A: and other kind of benefits that folks that are working 

43.00 45.91 A: like office jobs that do so um 

46.91 50.72 A: i think that they deserve to get um more than five fifteen 

51.04 58.67 B: yeah but don't you think that if minimum wage were not that it'd be like the the basis of inflation going up 

58.76 62.74 A: yeah i think i think so i think that ah that also contributes to it but 

62.81 69.01 A: but ah that that's also a small part of it it's also ah you know fuel costs 

69.14 72.81 A: um people um getting raises 

72.90 76.52 A: ah that that's also part of it um 

76.60 79.58 A: and it's built in to a lot of the 

79.89 85.67 A: government ah decision makers they they they take they do automatic 

85.76 93.85 A: you know cost of living um projections every year that that ah i i don't think that the minimum wage is a cause of those increases but 

94.11 102.16 A: but ah they're just kind they're just a part of the the whole picture it's not just ah okay you've raised the minimum wage so everything else must go up because um 

102.39 110.37 A: the service sector is um it's just a a part of the economy there's other things like fuel costs and energy 

108.98 109.90 B: yeah 

111.37 121.60 B: yeah i think ah that is also a good idea for it to go because it gives the workers more of an incentive to do a good job you know and and give better customer service 

121.27 122.33 A: right 

121.69 127.23 B: 'cause a a lot of times you go to ah fast food places ah workers just seem 

127.28 129.94 B: really unhappy and like they don't want to be there 

129.64 131.49 A: mhm 

130.49 137.90 B: and i'm i'm thinking that you know if it goes up that ah they'll they'll just have a better attitude they'll be happier that they're 

137.84 145.58 B: there making money and they'll do more and afterwards go out of their way for the customer and and be pleasant 

139.52 140.58 A: that's true 

145.66 146.75 A: right 

146.91 148.78 B: yeah 

149.10 152.61 B: ah it seems like a lot of times like i go there 

149.61 150.19 A: (( mm )) 

152.64 157.33 B: like last night i went to burger king and they were just real real rude 

157.70 163.81 B: i i don't know do you think that that a pay increase will actually help that think it would attract ah 

164.09 166.11 B: ah different people 

166.29 167.56 B: to work 

167.98 170.46 A: yeah i i think so i think that um 

171.30 185.30 A: that that that that maybe the ah if you have like a range of between five fifteen and six or seven bucks the manager can um can build in kind of increases for for the good employees and and those that don't ah 

185.32 189.97 A: you know won't get 'em um but yeah i th- think that ah 

190.97 197.35 A: that it's also part of you know the the the just like the way that that industry is like um 

197.41 208.47 A: restaurants you really just have to make a profit and r- really sometimes the employees are just kind of like an after thought so maybe that that should be for them being ah not having a great attitude and that sort of thing 

209.26 210.23 B: yeah 

210.41 218.54 A: now like let me ask you are you a- are you put of the ah the university of pennsylvania or is that the we're we're just like two two strangers talking is that the way this works 

210.88 211.73 B: yeah 

218.75 232.99 B: ah kind of i i go to school in arizona i'm i'm visiting my cousin ah who goes to the university of pennsylvania right now and ah i signed up for the survey where ah where where we're going to call people and ask them about different topics 

226.07 226.93 A: okay 

232.54 237.91 A: oh so so you're you're actually doing the calling i mean 'cause i just call ah they just called me i don't know i don't this is my first ah 

237.96 241.19 A: one of these ah surveys and i yeah i found out about it through a 

241.36 251.50 A: email that i got from a friend but i didn't know i didn't know if you were you were part of the um the research or you or they just hooked up total you know strangers to talk to each other i don't know 

244.14 245.22 B: oh yeah 

250.84 251.70 B: yeah 

251.93 253.61 B: are you getting paid for it 

253.20 257.73 A: i think so yeah not yet i haven't gotten anything yet but that's what they said 

254.73 255.88 B: [laughter] 

258.07 263.24 B: all right yes ah i i i think all right i guess we're the same we're the same thing then 

262.80 263.97 A: okay okay 

263.64 267.64 B: 'cause like i signed up for it and they just called me right now [laughter] 

266.56 268.83 A: yeah [laughter] same here 

268.94 269.98 B: yeah 

270.32 272.18 B: that's cool what did i just say 

273.46 275.35 B: (( yeah all right ah )) 

275.71 280.01 B: ah th- they're recording we've got to talk about [laughter] can't 

278.77 280.48 A: we've got to talk about it for ten minutes 

280.57 281.95 B: yeah i think so 

281.66 283.18 A: okay um 

283.91 286.69 A: (( y- you know ah also a lot of times ah )) 

286.76 292.20 A: that ah that also comes into the the um minimum wage issue is the 

292.22 297.22 A: like overtime that ah a lot of ah people like you said at burger king 

297.30 298.63 A: they um 

298.88 303.86 A: you get whatever the the forty hour minimum w- work week and ah 

304.15 306.12 A: so you get a lot lot of a lot of 

306.17 313.00 A: you know s- students or people that that work in those kinds of restaurants and that sort of thing that that that they want to work more 

313.04 314.93 A: and a lot of times the um 

315.64 323.20 A: the the the manager wants them to work more but but because of overtime they don't want to pay them so that's also something that um 

323.89 337.68 A: that that could could use some strengthening like ah the the government a- and and other times you know they'll they'll the employers will say well can you come in just you know they call it like a personal time where they just they'll they'll tell 'em well if if you work ah 

337.69 341.31 A: three hours you know kind of like off the books 

341.57 345.10 A: you know i i can let you leave early like on a slow day that sort of thing 

345.19 346.04 B: yeah 

345.23 349.21 A: you know even though the employee may be working more than forty hours they will only get paid um 

349.58 354.17 A: they will only get paid for the forty but the um the extra the extra 

354.38 365.36 A: time that they put in you know is actually there should be some enforcement is what i'm trying to say because these are you know folks um they want to spend time with their families or you know just to have a day off and that sort of thing 

365.34 366.93 B: yeah 

367.02 368.93 B: yeah they they ah 

369.07 377.47 B: they like to get their employees to work right at forty and then like no more but they want to get as much as they can out of them 

374.45 375.28 A: (( [noise] right )) 

377.65 379.19 B: but 

379.24 380.08 B: (( ah )) 

381.94 383.95 A: yeah a lot a lot of times um 

385.08 388.53 A: especially the a lot of businesses will say oh man you can't ah 

388.79 391.50 A: you can't raise the minimum wage we're going to go out of business 

392.05 396.31 A: but they never say that when and you raise prices on potatoes or something like that you 

392.35 393.33 B: yeah 

396.40 397.31 B: yeah 

396.60 401.08 A: know it's it's sort of like a class kind of thing sometimes it like my opinion is that 

401.11 407.36 A: they just say oh you know don't do don't do the minimum wage 'cause that'll really 

407.39 415.95 A: cause us to raise prices [mn] and i think that that the if you introduce competition there'll be more 

416.36 418.70 A: there'll be um the lower prices 'cause 

419.10 422.36 A: yeah i think i remember like a few years' ago when you went to to 

422.15 435.56 A: to a restaurant you didn't have those dollar menus but since like wen- i think wendy's introduced them and then everybody had to copy them and so it's really competition that that keeps it's the that they just want to make you know make the money the the the owners 

429.57 430.71 B: oh yeah 

435.68 444.95 A: and when you introduce competition they'll be like more more respectful that they if i don't put a dollar ah many will mcdonalds is going to get all the business or whoever does 

445.73 452.87 B: yeah and ah i i'm sure that the company's are still make their money i mean they're bringing it 

451.11 452.29 A: mhm 

452.95 459.89 B: like mcdonalds ah i'll ah you walk around a a city like they have stores all over the place 

459.35 461.03 A: yeah 

460.00 463.50 B: and this company is huge and they can afford to pay 

464.04 467.81 B: to to raise the minimum wage and keep their prices the same 

468.10 475.38 B: and and just like some of the other places i don't know if some of the smaller companies can a- can afford to pay as much as 

475.86 477.74 B: as ah mcdonalds 

477.95 478.87 A: (( [noise] who might )) 

478.00 485.81 B: but ah in in arizona there's a a small small company and it's getting really big called in and out burger and ah 

486.03 494.51 B: it's it's a it's independently owned but ah they've got like the best food but they they ah they pay their employees about nine dollars an hour 

494.81 497.38 B: and it it's just like a burger king 

497.22 498.42 A: mhm 

497.80 505.37 B: but ah they ah they have the best service and the best food and like that company is just getting huge 

505.80 506.74 A: (( you know what is )) 

505.80 514.96 B: and i think it might be because that they're they're paying so much ah their their employees 'cause that's why people go back because of the quality 

509.51 510.63 A: right 

515.27 529.27 A: yeah and you know you're talking about mcdonalds and i i here in ah i'm in the the washington d. c. area there's a there's another restaurant that i that i that is owned now i think mcdonalds bought bought 'em out and they're called um 

530.23 538.80 A: i don't know it's like a it's like a mexican food place that's you know it's like fresh a lot of fresh ingredients i'm trying to remember the name but but it's like a burrito place 

536.04 537.09 B: oh yeah 

538.81 544.98 A: and um and the peop- the people there are really happy and it and it looks like a real clean place and and the employees have um 

544.86 554.90 A: i'm not sure how much they make 'cause i don't know anybody there but they have like a nice t. sh- n- nice n- kind of polo shirts with a with a logo and and they seem to be really friendly and and and mcdonalds 

554.99 568.38 A: you know has kind of you know kind of noticed that a lot of people are starting to like this kind of you know fresh mexican food and not not greasy and that sort of thing so they may be paying them you know a lot of money and and so that's a further division they don't want to put mcdonalds on it because people will be turned off but it's 

561.77 562.57 B: yeah 

568.55 569.58 A: (( you know ))
