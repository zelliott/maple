0.00 1.76 A: hey this is louis 

1.32 3.34 B: [noise] hi this is greg 

3.04 6.80 A: hey what's going uh so bio terrorism 

6.02 15.69 B: okay hey uh they're gonna warn us at the end right hear about ten minutes coming up okay i'm trying to find a clock right now um anyway what can the united states do about it right 

8.90 9.84 A: yes 

15.06 17.02 A: right exactly 

16.34 23.04 B: [noise] uh gee that's a very good question i mean i don't i don't think you could ever totally prevent it you know what i'm saying [noise] [noise] 

22.51 27.08 A: i don't think so either because i mean you could easy sneak it over through 

27.19 34.31 A: any means you can i mean i guess through suitcases through viles or what have you you could put it in the subway system in new york 

34.55 44.27 A: you can put in um in national monuments and things like that so it's pretty hard it's it is a pretty hard topic as far as what you could do about bio terrorism what are you thinking 

43.08 51.63 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] you know wh- what i think is that yeah you can't stop uh you know the means i mean because anybody works hard enough long enough you're gonna 

51.63 59.10 B: obviously be able to like you said put something in a you know suitcase somewhere i mean eventually you know sooner or later it's gonna happen you know 

59.21 66.49 B: um the only thing i think that you could do is try to like take away not so much you know the means but maybe the cause you know work on the cause because i mean 

66.36 75.54 B: you have people out there who you know er some people feel that you know they i- it's it's their religious right you know it's religion that's like motivating them that 

75.33 84.19 B: you know somehow they feel like this is god's work or something and kill you know [noise] kill the evil americans you know and so forth and so you got to convince the world i think that the u._s. is 

83.98 92.11 B: and this and that we're not such the bad guy you know what i mean now i don't know it's a tough way to [laughter] convince some people that we're not but i think that's all we got to do 

92.79 97.09 A: yeah that's a good point but but i mean how how are we about to i 

95.48 96.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

97.27 107.20 A: mean how are you gonna think of all about convincing other nations in the world that we're not exactly the bad guy when we go out to different nations and basically 

107.38 110.15 A: in a nutshell go in there 

110.22 118.81 A: and say do what we do and then we turn around and impose some imperialistic views you know like our way is 

118.90 121.85 A: supposed to better because we're democratic or 

122.36 124.22 A: westernized let's say 

123.62 125.80 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

124.56 126.88 A: a middle eastern country for example 

126.67 128.41 B: mhm 

127.39 128.99 A: like iraq for example 

128.77 130.55 B: mhm 

130.91 138.32 B: i'm sorry you know what i couldn't totally hear you on my cell phone you said uh we shouldn't impose our our imperialistic views or we should or 

137.63 142.68 A: so no i'm saying like how we how we get other people to think that we're not the bad guy 

142.03 144.74 B: oh oh uh we don't well em [noise] [lipsmack] [noise] 

143.31 153.38 A: right and when at the same time a lot of people think that we are because of ways that we handle foreign affairs for example so to prevent bio terrorism 

153.68 167.74 B: i see what you mean yeah i mean i i don't think it's gonna come easy i think the only thing you can do over time is um you know i think i see on the news last [noise] like nine oh two they have stuff going on in iran you know like where their students want change and all that 

167.55 181.30 B: uh because they don't want to ruin like you know religious leaders you know like telling them what to do and and so forth and they say that in iran which is like right next door to iraq that they actually have high regard -gard for americans who that they like americans 

180.78 182.09 A: i see okay 

181.17 182.22 B: um 

182.02 188.22 B: yeah i mean even though there's terrorism it's like if the government will have war then because the religious clerics who run the government push it 

188.01 201.51 B: and so you know if you let the people do it you know what i mean have their way so like i don't think that you know that some of the people over there would rather you know even in some of the er you know any muslim countries they'd rather like shy away from 

201.33 209.11 B: their governments because it's gone overboard you know religiously and that's what you know happened in our country like two hundred years ago i mean the puritans came 

208.91 219.03 B: because they wanted to practice their religious beliefs but then somebody realized you know a couple hundred years ago like if we're gonna have a country by the people you know for the people whatever we're gonna have to have an 

218.94 226.23 B: uh constitution that is inclusive of all people but if you you know you have to separate church and state as they say 

225.92 227.36 A: yeah 

226.03 234.44 B: because if you have the church like you know telling the government what to do all the time you know which church and how should they say it and i mean even if you say that 

234.25 240.72 B: you know you got christians running it or something well how many denominations of christianity are out there and they're all arguing with each other and you know 

239.65 241.42 A: that's true too yeah 

240.61 254.62 B: yeah so i mean you gotta you kind of like i think like in iraq they want to have a new government there that is gonna be you know by the people for the people but it's not gonna be run you know like in iran uh that even iranian people are protesting about their religious you know folk there 

250.35 251.24 A: mhm 

254.80 263.70 B: i think you have every right to practice whatever religion you want to do but you know when religion starts telling people what to do you know because i don't think all religions are 

257.54 259.03 A: right 

263.47 276.13 B: you know uh one is better than the other uh in the sense that you know um well you know people more people died i think by religious wars you know in the name of god and brotherhood [laughter] 

274.06 287.17 A: that's true too there they have different ideas and they're following whichever god or whichever religious view but you know some also botulism okay so they're doing like i say foreign powers using bio terrorism to they say 

279.46 281.03 B: mhm 

287.23 293.78 A: to inflict harm on our nation right but what about domestic terrorism you know the rest of terrorism 

289.54 290.79 B: mhm 

292.43 294.81 B: oh you got a point there yeah 

293.64 306.36 A: that's from inside you know let's say for example like the s- the skinheads right what's stopping one of them to get a vile there and put let's say to like a minority community let's say in a in a city somewhere 

298.02 299.10 B: yeah 

300.63 301.97 B: yeah you have a point 

306.25 312.55 A: i mean how are we supposed to stop that als- you know it's pretty it's p- it's pretty um pretty tough for um 

306.43 307.34 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

312.46 313.83 B: (( other way round )) 

312.70 316.70 A: for the call 'cause then you got germs that mutate too mean if you can stop germs from 

316.82 322.68 A: let's say you s- you stopped a certain germ from spreading right what's stopping that germ what's not stopping that germ to let's say 

322.91 328.22 A: mutate itself to another germ know what i mean like like build immunity to whatever 

324.97 326.90 B: (( you're right you're right )) 

328.43 329.37 B: mhm 

328.66 343.25 A: we might find to get the antibiotic and then turn around and change into something else s- something new sort of like aids you know aids could go through like one person one way and then and it affects them their immune system turn around to another person 

335.12 336.40 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

338.82 340.53 B: mhm 

343.45 344.77 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

343.46 348.75 A: it changes over so that's probably the hard time finding a cure for aids for example so i think if somebody 

348.77 350.59 A: (( either domestic or foreign )) 

351.95 356.71 A: could inflict a type of terrorism or a threat of terrorism 

354.31 355.66 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

356.07 357.82 B: mhm 

357.23 364.85 A: it's it's tough i mean i i mean it's pretty harming it it could be done but it's gonna take a lot of man hours a lot of i 

365.62 367.54 A: (( don't know it's it's tough it's tough )) 

367.21 370.07 B: and a lot of money too [laughter] 

368.22 371.20 A: yeah take a whole lot of money [laughter] 

370.33 375.98 B: well you know now that they got these uh new things coming out like sars or whatever they say it's uh 

374.77 377.62 A: yeah what's that about sars and monkey pox 

376.68 377.24 B: (( [noise] )) 

377.23 387.77 B: there's something new they say that scientists haven't really seen i mean you're supposed to catch it from a prairie dog or something [laughter] [laughter] yeah my prair- prairie dog yeah i've had him vaccinated and everything he's just fine 

382.36 384.77 A: some yeah sars 

387.75 399.60 B: [laughter] but i mean no seriously you got weird stuff like that coming up you're right and i mean for domestic terrorists um you know and and mutant strains that change all the time i think there was a movie back when i was a little kid i saw it 

399.42 404.87 B: um like twenty years ago or something uh in a movie called the andromeda strain or something you know 

404.09 415.70 A: well they had a more recent one than that outbreak you know ou- outbreak with dustin hoffman well and that was done with the monkey but andromeda strain i'm i heard of that movie i didn't see i didn't get to see that one um andromeda strain 

406.72 407.89 B: oh yes 

408.38 410.35 B: yeah that's right that's right 

411.88 412.82 B: mhm 

414.32 426.65 B: [lipsmack] i- it's like the same idea yeah and it was based on a book and the idea is that you know it's it's something that nobody can really control you know and it just it it multiplies out of hand and and so you're right like you know well the thing is 

416.27 417.14 A: oh 

426.54 438.23 B: though if you get a hold of that i mean i think a government is gonna have to have uh you know have to develop it 'cause they have the resources i don't think like somebody like that uh timothy mcveigh guy like a domestic terrorist like you're talking about 

437.44 439.15 A: (( hm right )) 

438.05 447.84 B: i don't think he could do that he could set up a bomb explosive you know but i i you know you'd have to take a government like iraq or somebody who supports maybe covertly you know like 

441.01 442.28 A: mhm 

447.47 448.37 A: yeah 

447.60 455.64 B: you know under the table uh terrorists and you know maybe they shipped all their stuff to syria now as they say and that's why we can't find that stuff i don't know [laughter] know 

455.07 456.14 A: that's true 

455.40 468.43 B: but but the point is that you know once that gets out then maybe you know those governments can give it even to domestic terrorists you know who you know have a grudge like you know timothy mcveigh who used to be in the army as i recall or something right 

467.05 469.15 A: hm exactly yeah 

468.43 475.54 B: yeah and he's just you know he's just a lu- lunar looser uh looney looser loner out there who just you know he wants to 

475.55 484.14 B: make his mark in history or whatever whatever the heck his you know cause was i'm not sure [laughter] i'm not sure in the end he was sure [laughter] but 

482.34 490.88 A: hm yeah that's true too yeah but then it's now they're saying like he might have act alone it might have been something this is what i heard somewhere 

490.88 500.41 B: yeah he had an accomplish he had at least er one accomplish and i think maybe more but the one guy they caught um i don't know he just he just faded away in the news yeah i never heard what happened to him 

495.37 496.69 A: (( mhm yeah yeah )) 

496.79 498.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

500.95 504.82 B: anyway but yeah i guess we're in c- agreement like you know you're gonna have to 

504.77 512.15 B: try to limit the government uh i mean e- even if you like you know you ya you convince other governments around the world we're not so bad or 

511.92 524.68 B: um you know you take away their ability i mean there's still a wacko or two out there and and you may never be able to there maybe something that happens and it's true that nobody can control you know another nine eleven in it's own own right 

524.07 528.82 A: yeah that's true whoever thought that would happen you know planes run into the world trade center you know 

528.33 532.13 B: [cough] well you know my one brother he was almost on that plane 

531.97 536.51 B: and she l- he works in boston and he was supposed to have an appointment [laughter] to go out 

535.29 536.26 A: (( yeah uh-oh )) 

536.31 540.28 B: to l._a. yes i'm i'm deviating from the topic but it's a real quickie 

540.07 554.15 B: you know it kind of affected my family because uh you know i realized you know um that i talked to mike the night before and said wait a second my brother said he was leaving you know the next day on a plane from boston to los angeles so when i turned on the t._v. after i heard it on the car radio i went back home 

553.80 554.70 A: right 

553.97 562.03 B: i had turned on the t._v. and i see them planes going out there you know from boston i i couldn't believe it so to me it like it struck home a little bit you know what i mean but 

562.17 575.54 B: at the same time it's like you know it's like it was just a a fate of uh you know act of god call it or fate or something that he didn't get uh the right cab that it it made him delayed he said he hadn't missed a plane in like five years or something 

575.10 576.45 A: (( wow hm )) 

575.36 584.62 B: and you know he saw that one plane you know pull out of the uh you know the hangar or whatever and uh the you know the airport wing and he just missed it but i mean you know 

584.39 597.40 B: it just to me reflected how easy it is for anybody eventually to come up with some kind of crazy plan you know maybe some mad scientist you know even working domestically like that guy for anthrax or whatever he you know 

596.09 597.22 A: (( exactly )) 

597.31 599.86 B: yeah so i mean you can't even ev- even if you don't have a
