18.62 20.72 A: [mn] do you watch them 

20.48 24.46 B: one in a while i mean i'm not hooked like i have to watch every single show 

24.60 26.84 B: i mean sometimes you see the preview 

27.08 30.77 B: and to be quite honest sometimes i watch it 'cause the people are so dumb 

30.50 31.63 A: oh

43.07 44.07 B: (( i [noise] [noise] )) 

48.05 58.37 A: and one of the reasons they like to run those things they cost them very little they don't have to pay for script they don't have to pay for orchestras they don't have to pay for stars 

58.49 72.81 A: so ah when they get high ratings they charge a lot for the commercials and ah it it's most amazing to me that ah people of course most t._v. stinks i like to watch p._b._s. and then i watch certain 

72.70 81.09 A: shows like ah c._s._i. and ah let's see ah i used to love providence which they took off 

81.23 85.66 A: but ah which ones do you ah play do you watch 

85.59 86.81 B: (( [noise] um )) 

86.52 89.61 A: that that you think is half decent 

88.98 91.87 B: when i had cable i watched um

117.28 118.74 A: oh boy 

117.66 123.72 B: i'm like it's just stupid because i think it's so funny how somebody would do something like that 

123.16 125.03 A: but do you like to watch it 

124.82 132.50 B: [mn] well i never watch the whole show i don't think 'cause i just look at it and i'm like why in the world are people going on national t._v. 

132.69 139.40 B: like i guess acting weird or desperate thinking they're gonna be famous for what fifteen minutes you know 

138.48 142.72 A: yeah well that's what it is and they i suppose they get paid 

143.11 144.04 A: (( you know )) 

143.90 156.91 B: sometimes they get like endorsements or something you hear of 'em from ones and i i just [noise] i think it's embarassing to them i guess it's kind of it's kind of mean to say but it's kind of funny to watch people embarrass themselves i guess 

156.57 159.32 A: yeah they're but they're making fun of people 

159.59 171.77 B: yeah but it's oh that one i loved was joe millionaire i thought oh how they just lied for that i said that's kind of you know how payback i guess or the effect of t._v. it's just kind of interesting

192.05 200.75 B: yeah you ever notice that none of 'em do i mean none of 'em ever got married none of 'em really end up it's just oh i wanna be on t._v. for a while 

199.92 202.03 A: [noise] that's right it's a 

201.02 204.78 B: let me let me con myself into thinking this is real

216.92 219.52 A: you you're a programmer for people 

218.35 225.62 B: yeah so it's kind of it's kind of interesting you know the since i don't get a lot of people interaction i guess that's one of the reasons i watch those shows [noise] 

225.13 227.36 A: oh yeah so you can learn 

226.05 232.52 B: [noise] 'cause i'm in front of the computer a lot so i'm like hey let me just kind of is a temporary distraction for people or something 

232.24 243.70 A: yeah because i used to be in broadcasting ah i was disc jerky jockey [laughter] and and that was interesting oh i've done a lot of things but this is ah 

235.32 236.46 B: oh okay 

238.52 239.74 B: oh okay 

243.56 251.98 A: these shows just br- bring a lot of ratings to the show and they make a lot of money but eventually they'll die 

251.93 260.41 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i i mean i keep saying that but then like something interesting comes along and that's kind of the thrill it's like they keep topping themselves when you think they can't 

252.16 253.92 A: they were just ah 

260.33 266.56 A: well the last ah thing i heard is they're gonna have a channel with only reality shows

279.18 289.41 A: i get bored easily unless it's interesting you see p._b._s. and then of course ah some of the discovery channel is good and you know i 

288.58 297.27 B: yeah p._b._s. kind of has like things where they show the animals in their natural habitat that that's kind of reality i mean that's not rehearsed 

292.49 294.71 A: oh that that's good 

296.65 307.11 A: but it's different that is ah yeah that's educational and you can learn about various species and you know it's just nice so you married 

298.55 299.91 B: educational 

306.60 307.89 B: (( [noise] [noise] huh ))

314.98 316.40 B: (( yeah )) 

319.15 323.81 A: 'cause ah one that was five years old was getting a little cranky 

323.42 324.77 B: [noise] 

324.06 327.80 A: and we got a windows x._p. i suppose you have that don't you 

327.34 334.95 B: [noise] [noise] ah well i don't particularly like x._p. pro nor the two thousand they're still kind of buggy it's just microsoft's way of getting more money 

334.64 337.16 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] so what do you what do you have 

335.12 336.67 B: so that [noise] 

336.70 339.27 B: ah i actually program in unix and linux 

339.40 340.74 A: oh linux 

339.50 345.26 B: i mean i can get around microsoft office and microsoft works i know the coding for stuff like that 

342.82 351.21 A: [noise] so there's i see but we started with windows ninety eight and ah then it finally went kaput you know 

351.12 356.78 B: well now talking of computers you ever see that big brother show you can actually watch some of that on your computer 

351.36 352.32 A: so 

354.52 355.37 A: no 

357.12 359.02 A: um how do you do that 

358.42 365.62 B: like live it's ah you go into real player or whatever that was and it's like reality t._v. show i just thought about that when you mentioned computers 

361.76 362.74 A: (( yeah )) 

363.47 369.49 A: but what do you ah what do you ah pick up i mean what is the ah 

369.36 379.34 B: it's kind of like watching the actual t._v. show like the t._v. show kind of cuts it and splices it and edits it i guess the word i'm looking for to show you what's on t._v. in a half an hour 

379.02 381.01 A: what is the website [noise] 

379.53 380.18 B: so 

381.06 382.28 B: um 

382.41 388.49 B: is it an a._b._c. show if it's an a._b._c. or c._b._s. show it's usually on the front page and it says click here to view big brother 

388.94 393.31 A: oh so you just dial a._b._c. dot com 

393.05 395.94 B: yeah or it could be c._b._s. i'm not sure 

396.30 398.02 A: oh 

396.50 401.12 B: and it it's just kind of like charging people to watch you know 

401.13 406.13 B: it's the same thing reality t._v. show but it's everything it's not cut up it's not spliced or anything 

406.42 410.90 A: is it strictly ah on the computer 

406.73 407.91 B: and i thought 

411.03 413.86 B: yeah for that one for twenty four hour access 

413.80 416.94 A: let me hit i'm i've got hot sheet here 

416.55 419.00 B: yeah i don't know if it's actually on like now 

417.98 420.68 A: and i got a._b._c. i hit 

421.06 428.36 B: that's something i guess i'm interested in like like i guess [mn] y- y- you think they can't top themselves 'cause the last thing they did was so dumb 

428.21 429.61 A: [laughter] 

428.38 433.79 B: you think people are gonna say this is so stupid i'm tired of this and then they top themselves with something 

433.63 438.40 A: so the real reason you watch these is more for laughs 

438.11 446.47 B: yeah it's almost like a comedy show 'cause i mean i'm i'm amazed that anybody would wanna do that i'm like what is going through your mind 

440.68 441.80 A: [noise] because 

446.25 450.87 A: well they ah they probably pay them you know ah 

449.67 453.98 B: yeah well at least they get endorsements or something like some of 'em get nike or a movie 

451.57 458.31 A: let's see now i'm looking here on the a._b._c. thing virtual control 

457.52 464.77 B: if it's not on it might say something like coming and next month or whatever's i'm not sure when it is if they they don't 

463.51 466.23 A: oh it's not on all the time 

465.63 471.47 B: um well no it's kind of like a season like every i think big brother's is every three months or something 

471.65 477.98 B: or i i don't know when their schedule is it's weird so i mean the deal with big brother is they don't overkill it i guess 

478.21 479.45 A: now this 

478.44 486.73 B: like it's not all the time like you didn't even know what it was as opposed to some like oh well this show's on i see it every single day every single preview big brother's a little bit more 

486.90 490.20 B: i don't think they do a lot of marketing with that it's i think that 

487.08 488.10 A: oh 

489.06 500.13 A: but meanwhile what we're doing is very interesting i spoke to some guy from los angles last night you know and tonight you're at dallas 

495.23 496.48 B: oh [noise] 

499.91 500.95 B: mhm 

500.31 506.51 A: and then ah who knows what tomorrow will bring [laughter] it's very interesting 

504.57 505.86 B: (( i don't know it's just )) 

506.05 513.51 B: it is the topics and stuff like that i mean sometimes i'm like oh okay that's an interesting topic kind of throws you for a loop or something 

513.00 517.42 A: yeah they come up like last night we were talking about ah 

517.43 529.73 A: overeating or drinking or what's worse and he thought ah overeating is worse of course i thought that ah the worse is drinking 'cause you can kill yourself and other people 

529.67 530.69 B: mhm 

530.72 537.36 A: but these reality shows like i say it is so cheap to put 'em on the air 

537.59 547.55 A: that and they make a lot of money see they they get paid as you know in t._v. and radio by ratings if they have a high rating they charge more and if the rating's down they charge 

543.42 544.56 B: mhm 

546.16 548.08 B: yeah for the commercials and stuff 

547.62 551.31 A: yeah so that's why they ah they do this 

551.05 556.29 B: and it's definitely like they don't have a shortage of people who wanna do it you know it's not hard for them to find somebody 

554.43 562.76 A: oh man they have a thing i had an ad here in the paper ah models wanted actors i'm seventy two 

562.75 563.66 B: mhm 

563.04 571.05 A: so i answered that just see what's going on and there's somebody in ah down in ah florida answered they made a 

571.30 577.86 A: a appointment for me here in nashville and th- this is a scam 

578.10 590.86 A: they make you pay for pictures and they say they'll try and get you jobs 'cause i told 'em i said i have no talent really i'm just a ordinary oh that's okay it could do it anyway stupid you know 

589.14 589.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

591.59 592.93 B: that's strange 

592.02 596.30 A: [laughter] well th- well they have a lot of scams 'cause a lot of kids 

596.54 599.95 A: ah you know they um want 

598.12 598.47 B: (( [noise] ))
