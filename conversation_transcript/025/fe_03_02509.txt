6.67 14.83 A: [laughter] yeah i do i watch joe millionaire and um i watched married by america [laughter] and right now i'm watching mr personality 

15.07 16.07 A: (( how 'bout you )) 

15.16 22.34 B: cool no i haven't actually i don't think i've ever seen it's it's really terrible i've never seen a reality show 

22.53 23.46 A: never 

22.54 23.42 B: um 

23.60 30.39 B: no i i don't really watch t._v. all that much during the year i'm in s- in college so i'm like 

30.47 42.22 B: um i'm reading a lot of the time [lipsmack] so i don't i pe- i guess people in my in my dorm watch it watch um they've watched like joe millionaire they watched the finales and stuff but 

42.32 52.38 B: um mostly i i've read about it [laughter] i've read about 'em a lot but i ha- i just haven't really [lipsmack] watched i don't know so you you can tell me about i don't know which ones have you liked the best or 

49.65 50.73 A: [laughter] 

52.39 65.55 A: well i don't have cable so i really don't watch that much t._v. either i just watch fox um and i don't know for some reason married by america i was just like i can't believe you know that this is that the people are actually going to do this 

54.37 55.37 B: mhm 

55.40 56.52 B: yeah 

57.06 57.99 B: mhm 

65.03 66.26 B: yeah 

65.54 78.72 A: and it turned out of course that they weren't i mean in the end no one actually got married but by that time i was kind of used to watching the monday night slot and so then i started just started watching mr personality because it was on at the same time 

68.08 69.19 B: right 

73.59 74.56 B: yeah 

78.27 79.65 B: yeah 

79.07 81.86 A: and uh monica lewinsky is the host of that 

81.27 82.72 B: oh right 

82.01 88.69 A: yeah so i was kind of interested to see how that would turn out too but really she's like she's a better host than i would've 

89.37 94.86 A: and uh [mn] like um on last week's show they were dismissing some of the guys 

94.82 109.82 A: and uh one of the guys tried to quit early because he knew he was going to be dismissed and monica totally gave him a smackdown [laughter] it was like you know that you were going to get kicked off anyway so don't think you can get away with it just like that [laughter] so that was kind of fun [laughter] 

98.64 99.28 B: (( mm )) 

101.15 102.43 B: [laughter] that's cool 

106.02 107.18 B: [laughter] 

107.65 108.79 B: yeah 

109.19 113.44 B: the one that i have like actually thought about watching is um 

113.26 125.35 B: [lipsmack] like there's there's one on a food network which cause we we have we have like i don't know somehow our we get cable even though we don't pay for it in my in my dorm we get like all the all the channels so on the food network they have 

125.20 139.85 B: i don't know if you've heard about it they have this one called date plate and they um the people like guys there's this woman who the guys are trying to um impress and so they they cook her different meals but i haven't [lipsmack] i haven't watched it 

138.67 142.28 A: does she get to see him before the or does she just pick them based on the meal 

141.08 142.05 B: um 

142.15 149.57 B: i'm not sure i i haven't watched it so i [laughter] don't i don't know anymore but there is this i read this ar- um this thing 

144.79 145.78 A: [laughter] 

149.35 159.32 B: um [mn] and supposedly oh no i think this is the false one i i just saw this it was like this stupid little quiz and it was like which reality show is not in production right now 

159.34 168.40 B: and one of the ones that i thought actually would be kind of interesting was um because i think that animals do know is they had it it was like a show 

168.39 172.46 B: this is this is the one that that actually is not happening but um 

172.35 173.75 B: [mn] they said 

173.60 177.49 B: a show on animal planet where people choose um 

177.32 189.60 B: people choose their dates by like their who their animal likes or something which but you know like i don't know animals have a sense about people so i didn't think it was that far fetched but apparently it's not being done 

181.42 182.24 A: [laughter] 

189.84 193.43 A: yeah that is actually i think that's a good idea too and i also think that 

189.93 190.77 B: so 

193.25 206.03 A: like people who are like each other tend to have similar animals you know what i mean so if i like large dogs but not like tiny cats i'll [mn] you know someone else who also likes large dogs is going to be more like me 

197.18 198.53 B: right yeah 

205.71 215.96 B: yeah definitely um they're you always they i mean people are [mn] always getting together when they have dogs and like going to dog runs and stuff 

206.23 207.27 A: so 

207.75 208.67 A: yeah 

215.72 216.82 A: yeah 

216.24 219.68 B: have you ever watched um american idol that's the one that like 

219.73 228.60 A: i watched like one show of it but i don't know that's the probably the reality show that i like the least and although i did watch uh was it popstars 

225.02 226.17 B: yeah 

228.03 228.94 B: uh-huh 

228.72 237.24 A: um i guess it was already a year ago i tried to i watched it like twice but i couldn't really get into it i don't know i just watching them sing is a little bit boring 

237.62 239.12 A: i think [laughter] 

238.25 239.24 B: yeah 

239.35 245.89 B: um did you have you seen the new like reality movie the cancun yeah 

243.80 251.51 A: oh the new cancun or real cancun [laughter] i saw the previews at the movie theater last week but i don't think i'd actually pay to see it 

246.19 247.43 B: yeah 

248.46 249.53 B: yeah 

250.86 259.48 B: yeah it's like i think i guess i i heard that they're doing there was going to be like so many reality shows this summer but and they're just they're just really 

259.47 267.46 B: um going to be really sure i mean i don't know you i guess you like them so one of the questions like that we were supposed to talk about was why why do you think 

267.04 268.40 A: why do i like 'em 

267.67 276.62 B: yeah i mean you said you said kind of that um that it's like you can't believe that this is happening it's kind of like a fascination i can see that 

273.04 274.12 A: right 

274.92 284.69 A: well yeah yeah i mean basically i don't watch 'em too much i probably i watch like an hour a week um but one of the things that i like about it is that 

278.20 279.22 B: yeah 

279.77 280.99 B: yeah 

285.16 291.73 A: like i guess it's just [mn] i i don't like laugh tracks [laughter] so i'm not fond of sitcoms 

288.69 290.19 B: mm yeah right 

291.04 293.48 B: (( exactly i can see that )) 

291.87 292.95 A: um 

293.38 304.59 A: i don't like how many times they cut to commercial there's something like it's like within the hour in these reality t._v. shows it's it's only like thirty minutes long [laughter] because of all the commercials but i do like you know i mean 

300.95 301.82 B: (( [laughter] )) 

301.88 302.85 B: yeah 

304.68 312.63 A: i- i- it is unscripted and i realise that they edit it and they take out parts they don't like but it is a little bit [mn] less predictable 

312.00 313.17 B: yeah 

312.49 319.91 A: than some t._v. you know i read a actually i think it was even in newsweek that they're developing a reality t._v. channel 

320.21 321.28 B: (( oh yeah )) 

320.40 323.21 A: like it's going to be all reality t._v. shows 

322.18 327.30 B: yeah i think i saw that too that's i mean wow [laughter] yeah 

324.96 333.98 A: i that's too much in my opinion i could not stand it i mean if you're watching all reality t._v. all day why don't you just like live your life because that's reality too [laughter] 

331.25 333.00 B: right [laughter] really 

333.15 334.96 B: yeah um 

334.08 334.92 A: so 

335.78 349.31 B: i was going to say like um oh did you ever watch like real world i [mn] that's that i guess and that's even less reality but that was kind of the first one that they ever did i watched some of like real world and road rules 

348.02 362.30 A: i used to watch road rules um just like i one time i rented this apartment where the landlady had cable and uh [laughter] i used to watch road rules like that and i i did like i liked the challenges where they made 'em go do stuff 

349.45 350.76 B: yeah 

360.30 361.32 B: yeah 

361.58 362.90 B: yeah 

362.53 373.80 A: um but i used to get really annoyed at like the snotty you know they would do these like um interviews with everybody [laughter] and and it was it was so petty and like so catty sometimes it was funny but it would be like you know 

367.94 368.98 B: yeah 

373.96 382.82 A: they'd have you know melissa always does this and i just i was so annoyed today when melissa did that thing she always does [laughter] so 

376.06 377.08 B: mhm 

380.21 389.94 B: yeah [laughter] yeah those i i like i said i did i i had [mn] really almost forgotten that i used to watch those sometimes like they like on 

390.10 397.57 B: on m._t._v. they would have marathons so i'd like sit down and but that was before i guess i don't watch t._v. all that much now but 

397.69 398.49 B: um 

398.68 400.36 B: i don't know it's 

400.51 413.17 B: um and i was i thought some of the some of the game shows that looked kind of interesting that i didn't like the amazing race except that they've really like bombed it seems like 

412.62 415.14 A: (( i kind of wa- i kind of like fear factor )) 

415.14 417.05 B: i haven't seen that is that 

416.02 422.42 A: that's kind of a game show well i mean basically you have you know you have a group of people and they each have to do the stunts 

417.09 418.28 B: yeah 

422.25 432.10 A: and you know whoever doesn't do the stunt doesn't [mn] get to go on to the next round and they do it or whatever until there's one person left and then that person gets the money i think it's fifty thousand dollars 

425.90 427.07 B: right 

431.34 432.79 B: yeah 

432.17 445.23 A: so that's kind of sometimes they have them do stuff that is really looks really scary and so i'll like like sometimes if i'm surfing through and i see it on i'll be like watching it but i don't even know what time slot it has exactly 

436.69 438.04 B: yeah 

444.75 447.10 B: yeah did you watch survivor 

446.77 447.81 A: (( uh-uh )) 

447.44 449.36 B: yeah i didn't either and i 

449.31 456.76 B: it's kind of one of the reasons which is sort of perverse but i feel like i don't know it's it's it's sort of pop culture that i'm not 

456.62 465.98 B: in on those um like when people are talking about you know survivor the people who actually go on after survivor is over 

465.85 475.02 B: and you know people who either get commercial spots i sit and like who is that i feel kind of out of tune 'cause it's such a water cooler subject now and really 

469.91 471.20 A: exactly 

474.11 484.51 A: well i guess i'm not just not just good at recognizing celebrities either because it took me a while to realise like i guess the some of the women that were on joe millionaire are like pitching different kinds of products and stuff now 

476.58 477.73 B: yeah 

481.24 482.13 B: mhm 

483.42 484.48 B: (( oh yeah )) 

484.42 489.73 A: yeah like one of 'em was on a k._f._c. commercial with uh george kostanza from seinfield 

489.16 490.40 B: (( oh yeah )) 

489.82 497.91 A: and like i was like huh she looks kind of familiar but and [mn] i even used to watch the show so i guess you could say her fifteen minutes of fame are over 

492.34 493.28 B: yeah 

494.74 495.84 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

497.23 498.45 B: yeah 

498.47 499.28 B: um 

499.39 500.47 B: [noise] did 

500.71 513.77 B: 'cause i i heard that like [mn] he the joe millionaire guy and whoever he picked or whoever picked whoever made he got together with they um they either broke up they broke up didn't they or do you know 

513.02 524.20 A: [mn] um i don't think they ever actually dated like uh her name was zora [laughter] and um you know they made uh they created a zora day in her town 

515.45 516.47 B: right 

517.70 519.37 B: right yeah that's it 

523.97 534.34 A: like her hometown [laughter] i guess she's the most famous person who ever came from there um but you know basically they they both got the money and there wasn't any contingent on them staying together 

527.28 528.14 B: [laughter] 

533.89 535.17 B: mhm 

534.45 540.32 A: um so i don't think they did [laughter] i haven't seen 'em in even any pictures since then 

536.68 537.82 B: yeah 

539.48 541.56 B: yeah yeah 

540.51 544.71 A: but you know joe millionaire's actually from around here he's from richmond i think 

542.72 543.58 B: is he 

544.35 545.09 B: huh 

544.88 545.83 A: yeah 

545.50 546.55 B: yeah 

545.97 553.35 A: he's actually he was playing in um not playing but i guess just showing up in a in a club the other day what is it um 

554.38 555.26 A: [lipsmack] is it 

555.70 559.77 A: [mn] um oh never mind i can't remember the name of the club [laughter] but 

557.72 558.75 B: (( [laughter] )) 

559.87 570.29 A: oh the one thing about uh mr personality that i thought was kind of cool is uh the first thing that the mean character did hayley the woman who's supposed to be searching for um 

570.63 582.49 A: searching for her soul mate [laughter] between the guys who are all wearing masks is she had 'em all give her a gift and uh it was really interesting to see what sort of gifts these guys picked out 

574.23 575.27 B: mhm 

581.88 583.28 B: yeah 

582.67 593.18 A: and some of 'em were just so ridiculous [laughter] like [laughter] one of the guys actually brought her a book called a hundred bes- a hundred of the best sports jokes 

585.18 585.99 B: (( [laughter] )) 

592.71 594.09 B: oh my god 

593.41 595.02 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

594.34 595.64 B: that's ridiculous 

595.04 598.30 A: and one of 'em gave her like a porcelain frog 

597.86 598.75 B: [laughter] 

598.42 599.89 A: and one of 'em gave her this is was
