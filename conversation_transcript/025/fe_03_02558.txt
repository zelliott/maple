353.26 366.44 B: you know he had served in combat in many different locations and then at some point he was offered this position to be the military attache to carry the nuclear football around for the president and he did that for about three years i think he writes in this book for president clinton 

356.16 357.42 A: -cations right 

362.04 362.84 A: uh-huh 

365.94 366.93 A: (( [noise] uh-huh ))

383.61 385.88 B: (( and ah )) 

387.14 397.99 B: what he writes in there is tremendously troubling to me but it confirms a idea that crossed my mind a while ago and that is for the years that mr clinton was president ah 

397.09 398.06 A: mhm 

397.95 409.47 B: and i'm the same age as the president so it's a disgrace as i feel that at this point in time to my generation that the best we could do was william jefferson clinton because 

401.44 402.06 A: (( mhm )) 

405.34 406.15 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

409.83 412.11 B: during those eight years 

411.97 426.50 B: there was no commander in chief of the united states army and those eight years where the wor- where this country existed without a commander in chief and therefore the world existed without a commander in chief of the united states armed forces 

426.10 427.04 A: mhm 

426.41 431.10 B: that led to problems that we are suffering from today 

430.88 431.80 A: (( exact- )) 

431.09 443.48 B: it was a long decline it was 'cause he didn't think of himself now i don't know that bush has to g- well get into a a a an air force outfit and fly around that may be going too much the other direction but it's the the point is 

443.27 451.46 B: that clinton did not see himself as capable of commanding the armed forces of the united states 

451.13 457.21 A: but he doesn't need to be he needs to surround himself with people that capable that's the only thing [noise] [laughter] 

453.01 453.81 B: well 

455.70 462.27 B: well he can surround himself with people that are capable but he has to have it within himself 

462.23 474.84 B: to give orders to do things and he has to truman was a short little guy but he understood that his responsibility was commander in chief and he stood up and said to general mcarthur 

474.99 476.31 B: you're fired 

476.63 486.73 B: that's he has to have the capacity to lead them and for them to feel that the the military to feel they're being led by someone that's my view 

485.54 490.91 A: that's why clinton was one of the most effective presidents we had though i really do yes 

488.96 490.19 B: you think so 

490.37 493.47 B: (( ah well )) 

491.54 494.46 A: i i stand behind so many things that he did

510.43 511.60 B: well 

513.63 526.95 B: i think he presented that i don't think that's the reality of what took place that's from my from my persp- the reality of what took place is the whole country was on a cocaine high the economy was was artificially 

526.93 528.26 A: (( i disagree they )) 

527.20 532.07 B: artificially pumped up and what we see now is the end result of 

532.07 535.59 A: had one of the best eras there were in his leadership
