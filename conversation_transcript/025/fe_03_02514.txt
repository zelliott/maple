0.00 2.04 A: hello my name's casey 

1.58 4.01 B: hi my name's stephanie how are you 

3.72 7.02 A: i'm all right but i i don't watch any television 

4.53 5.38 B: good 

6.82 10.38 B: (( oh then this is going to be quite an interesting conversation [laughter] )) 

10.65 15.43 A: uh i have i have heard of uh survivor though i i don't know anything about it do you 

15.33 27.72 B: um i was actually watching it right when i decided to call [laughter] so to me uh this is a very interesting topic because my friend i mean we don't sit around watching t._v. all day but 

27.20 28.33 A: mhm 

27.50 32.32 B: it's the one time during the week when we all kind of gather and cook dinner 

31.01 33.43 A: i've i've heard other people say that 

32.81 38.60 B: yeah like gather cook dinner drink wine and like just enjoy each other's company 

38.22 39.55 A: mhm 

38.69 52.75 B: um and i don't know what it is but people get so addicted to reality t._v. and we all just like we're like oh it's tonight's the bachelor everyone we're meeting at this person's house and like tons of people come it's kind of a social event now 

52.40 53.68 A: (( mhm )) 

53.09 59.20 B: and i don't know i know a lot of people around the country that have you know have like survivor parties or 

58.81 60.92 A: well what do they do exactly on the show 

60.82 66.00 B: um well with survivor it's like a bunch of different people 

66.33 72.48 B: [lipsmack] um like i don't know it starts off with like twenty five people and they're in different groups and they all have to like 

72.66 78.87 B: basically like live in the wild um and they make alliances with other people um 

77.98 79.92 A: wh- what do you mean the wild 

79.87 84.70 B: like right now they're in where are they they're in like the middle of thailand or something 

84.36 85.30 A: okay 

84.89 90.88 B: um so like they have to you know find their own food cook their own food they live like 

89.55 93.16 A: so you're talking away from [mn] away from city away from other people 

92.56 94.53 B: yeah they're not near anyone 

95.02 97.81 B: i mean they're like in the middle of a jungle or something 

96.79 100.77 A: and these are these are all like american people people who aren't used to being there right 

99.85 101.37 B: yes exactly 

100.79 101.71 A: okay 

101.61 113.43 B: um and they they like the show doesn't give them any food at all so like right now they've been on the show for like twenty six days so they're very like emaciated because they hardly get to eat and 

109.25 110.48 A: (( mm )) 

113.46 120.37 B: i mean basically who can survive the longest in the wilderness and who can make the most alliances so that people 

120.62 131.07 B: like keep them on the show 'cause what happens is every show they end up kicking someone off and like usually people get kicked off because they're like a threat to other people 

131.73 135.64 B: i.e. 'cause at the end the person wins like a million dollars or something 

136.01 137.33 A: what uh 

137.50 143.09 A: okay i i d- i don't exactly follow what do you mean a a threat they they're 'cause they compete 

140.82 142.41 B: (( [lipsmack] um okay so )) 

142.75 148.42 B: yeah basically everyone wants to be like the last person the survivor because 

147.37 150.36 A: how how do they decided who who gets who leaves 

149.95 164.29 B: well that's the point like if you make alliances and like become friends with certain people like everyone starts to have like kind of clicks or clans and then if they decide they don't like one person people kind of like 

159.37 160.51 A: mhm 

164.16 167.00 B: determine that and they kick that person off 

166.73 168.77 A: so you so they vote 

168.87 170.58 A: amongst themselves 

169.96 171.83 B: amongst themselves yeah 

171.18 172.48 A: (( oh okay )) 

172.39 173.59 B: so that's 

172.82 176.28 A: and so so your own teammates decide if you have to leave or not 

174.92 176.88 B: yeah exactly 

177.58 184.38 B: so i don't know that's survivor but i don't i actually don't really watch this show that much i um i watch the [laughter] bachelor 

182.00 182.90 A: (( mhm )) 

184.30 187.77 A: what is what is that one no i haven't heard anything about that one 

184.77 186.42 B: have you heard of that [mn] 

187.10 191.43 B: just out of curiosity why you don't watch t._v. because 

191.82 194.68 A: uh just never got in the habit 

194.37 196.03 B: never watched it ever 

195.61 196.88 A: no never 

196.75 199.97 B: so like with the whole war going on you didn't watch t._v. at all 

199.72 203.39 A: no i get all my information off a c._n._n. dot com 

201.87 202.98 B: off the web 

203.11 204.03 B: uh-huh 

204.16 214.59 B: okay um well the bachelor it's really really stupid i mean and the other thing is this like all these shows speak to pretty educated people 

213.98 214.96 A: mhm 

214.59 226.64 B: but i don't know it j- it just like strikes a chord of interest but anyhow the bachelor is like starts out with like twenty seven girls and one guy and usually it's a really famous wealthy man 

226.29 227.18 A: uh-huh 

226.65 234.51 B: and he basically narrows down like through weeks and weeks um like down to f- he's down to four women now 

234.47 244.79 B: and then [mn] like next week he'll narrow it to three two and then finally one and like the last one supposedly he'll propose to her or they'll get enga- whatever you know they'll start dating or something 

245.70 249.47 B: so that's the major show reality show right now among women 

250.13 256.93 A: uh [mn] i i don't does that really work uh have they ever been through a season and the people got married or 

256.54 267.06 B: um well two of them they actually did ask the other to like marry them but they split up um but the just the past season the two people are still together 

261.27 262.08 A: mhm 

267.62 268.76 A: mm 

268.69 280.39 B: and this one um i don't know i was reading on the internet today that like the guy we don't know who he picks yet but he said that the girl that he picked uh they're together still so 

278.00 278.85 A: (( uh )) 

281.75 283.68 B: yeah 

284.69 286.29 B: that's about it [laughter] 

287.02 292.68 A: [laughter] i like the sounds of being being in the jungle better it sounds kind of the other one sounds pretty girly 

292.50 298.79 B: yeah i mean a lot of the a lot of guys actually watch it to see the girls um 

297.23 298.12 A: uh-huh 

299.04 300.80 B: the wilderness one 

300.95 308.31 B: survivor is definitely like more rugged and whatever but i think there's like more drama associated with the bachelor 

308.79 310.56 A: what do they eat on survivor 

310.66 317.92 B: um they eat they kill like wild stuff and then they get like a porridge of uh 

316.09 317.20 A: [laughter] 

317.99 319.45 A: [laughter] 

318.11 319.78 B: (( why are you laughing )) 

319.93 322.35 A: those crows they show 'em eating it 

321.93 327.86 B: yeah it's pretty nasty and then they give them like a cup of rice a week or something 

327.33 328.71 A: mhm 

328.18 332.09 B: and then um sometimes in like the events they have to do 

331.66 332.52 A: uh-huh 

332.19 343.18 B: um they like once were eating like [mn] disgusting things like um what do they call it centipedes and live bugs and all this nasty stuff 

337.40 338.15 A: [mn] 

340.60 341.51 A: (( [laughter] )) 

342.65 343.21 A: (( [mn] )) 

343.21 346.69 B: and like some people were like throwing up on t._v. and all that stuff 

346.89 350.68 A: have you have you ever heard of any of the japanese reality shows 

350.11 352.18 B: no oh like iron chef 

352.20 360.47 A: well ye- the japanese do all kinds of uh weird weird competition like game shows where they're they're mean to the contestants when they don't uh 

360.73 363.59 A: when they get questions wrong or do something wrong 

362.28 365.50 B: oh really no tell me about that 

365.01 373.00 A: well i i i've seen clips of it and i've i've i've heard people talking about them but th- you know i haven't haven't seen too many myself 

372.64 373.49 B: mhm 

373.03 379.17 A: but i i heard that that japan is the country that originated the the punishment deemed game shows 

379.15 383.08 B: really oh i'd never heard of that like the only 

379.83 380.97 A: mhm 

383.09 387.56 B: like real live show that i know of is iron chef do you know that show 

386.05 390.66 A: mhm i i've seen i've i've seen that i've seen an episode of that 

388.92 391.78 B: yeah it's pretty funny but 

392.39 395.47 B: i i haven't really watched any of those like i thought 

395.54 401.52 B: the main thing with the japanese was like their um cartoons and stuff that became really popular here 

401.37 403.78 A: and that's made a lot of money in this country 

403.19 406.03 B: yeah [lipsmack] um 

406.32 415.75 B: oh there's a presidential address to make okay anyhow um i don't really know what else to say about reality t._v. because you don't really watch it 

415.22 416.93 A: [laughter] 

417.71 419.14 B: so 

419.36 421.48 B: [lipsmack] uh what else can i tell you 

420.67 423.67 A: well i guess i guess the war would be reality t._v. 

423.83 426.71 B: i mean the war is just [mn] 

426.33 428.05 A: that's the real deal 

428.07 439.70 B: yeah but i i oh you know what i was watching this morning on the news when i was getting ready for work they were saying there's this guy um he's the mayor of redondo beach california 

432.76 433.73 A: what 

438.97 439.87 A: uh-huh 

439.53 444.84 B: and he went on um a reality show called blind date have you heard of that 

443.53 444.41 A: uh-huh 

444.78 447.67 A: i can imagine what it would be no i haven't 

446.52 453.67 B: okay so blind date basically is like literally it's a blind date and they film it okay so he went on blind date 

449.80 451.88 A: yeah mhm 

453.64 462.69 B: and he also went on like this other show another dating show and the newscaster was like don't you think this is going to hurt your political reputation 

462.58 475.74 B: um why would you go on a reality show and he's like well the funny thing is reality shows are not really reality it's all staged blah blah blah and all of us think that it's real but i think they totally stage everything 

470.68 471.74 A: mhm 

473.29 474.12 A: uh-huh 

475.35 476.59 A: (( mhm )) 

475.97 478.55 B: so he that was just interesting 'cause like 

478.98 480.01 B: i don't know 

480.09 488.99 B: everyone assumes that everything that happens on these shows is like real life drama and he was claiming they like tell you what to say sometimes and act 

489.10 493.91 B: or they just kind of like change the camera to make things look dramatic when they're not 

493.92 498.76 A: he must be a really good sport to even think about doing something like that if he's in politics 

498.13 507.85 B: i don't know why he did it to be honest [laughter] like i don't know and he was like well my constituents in california you know are liberal and they think it's funny 

506.86 509.07 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] [mn] )) 

508.97 509.94 B: so 

511.17 512.51 B: yeah 

512.52 515.21 B: [lipsmack] um i don't know what else to say 

515.25 524.29 A: are are are they going to be televising bush's uh he's he's on the aircraft carrier last i heard yeah he was going going to talk to some troops that were coming home 

519.67 521.38 B: is that where he is 

523.47 526.98 B: yeah channel sev- well i don't know where you're at so but 

527.41 530.82 B: um it's live from nine to nine thirty tonight 

531.13 533.23 A: (( yeah i )) 

532.65 534.66 B: did you even own a t._v. 

535.17 538.31 A: i yeah but it's it's not hooked up [laughter] 

537.67 538.62 B: oh 

539.02 542.09 B: so if you were [mn] want to watch the presidential address would you 

542.44 546.03 A: i would just download the movie clip and watch it on my computer 

545.52 546.40 B: uh-huh 

547.30 549.02 B: shit my phone [mn] 

547.74 553.55 A: but it's it's rare that i do that i just i i just would just as soon read everything 

554.85 561.85 A: and i have been following the war you know i d- i don't i i really didn't know what to think i didn't 

562.06 572.81 A: when when i heard that the the iraqi people were fighting back i thought you know maybe we were doing the wrong thing but now it it seems that you know some of them are are are pleased that we went over there 

572.35 574.43 B: mhm 

574.70 583.58 B: i mean i guess you could argue that the war was reality t._v. on because i think a lot of it was propaganda tha they were showing on t._v. for us and you know 

583.81 592.39 B: so if you if the argument is reality t._v. is just a crock anyways then i don't know maybe the stuff they were showing on t._v. was too 

593.57 596.41 A: i i i don't know i feel like i 

596.43 599.89 A: feel like the reporters didn't really get to say a whole lot or or do a whole lot
