0.21 1.70 B: (( [lipsmack] hello )) 

1.24 3.76 A: hello uh my name is maureen 

3.73 5.62 B: hi maureen my name's gordon 

5.32 6.39 A: hi gordon 

6.45 9.09 B: uh well do you watch reality t._v. 

8.97 13.19 A: [lipsmack] uh yes i do i watch uh survivors 

13.56 18.71 A: and i'm trying to think about that other show was uh where they all lived in the house together 

18.99 20.59 A: about three months 

20.51 23.48 B: uh-huh oh was that not like real world oh okay 

21.35 24.89 A: big brother i think it was big brother yes 

23.83 24.82 B: okay 

25.00 34.31 A: and i think the reason that the reality shows are and i don't watch all of them but like survivor to me survivor is like a microcosm of how 

34.30 44.90 A: things are in the work world i mean you know [lipsmack] well back biting people um [lipsmack] uh coming together falling apart you know uh 

36.12 38.87 B: uh-huh back biting 

44.94 48.83 A: uh with ulterior motives you know trying to get together to 

48.85 53.81 A: uh advance themselves making liaisons today different ones tomorrow 

53.85 62.80 A: you know all serving their own um individual needs it's unfortunate uh but uh it's kind of the way it is and i think by 

63.01 68.67 A: having a show like survivor on the air you actually get to observe that behaviour 

68.85 72.41 A: that you can only kind of feel when you're at work 

72.99 76.80 B: uh don't you think um possibly that it's uh 

77.03 84.65 B: [mn] it's a bit i mean i haven't i never watched uh survivor the only one i've been watching is uh is bachelor and uh 

84.67 90.94 B: i don't know if you can't really call that uh american idol that's not really reality t._v. um 

91.39 95.81 B: but um don't you think that's a bit do you think it's a bit staged i mean i do 

94.89 105.53 A: [lipsmack] yes um i'm i'm not too familiar with the bachelor but uh all of it is staged um because see you wouldn't watch something unless it was entertaining 

105.24 106.84 B: right 

105.81 110.57 A: so yeah it's staged it's not [mn] it's not reality the way 

110.75 118.14 A: actual reality is it's staged for entertainment purposes and i think even on the show that i watch survivor 

118.34 120.91 A: uh it's edited to be entertaining 

121.49 126.80 A: you know they're there for hours and hours and hours a day uh they're not showing you that reality 

126.73 128.74 B: right 

126.85 133.86 A: they're they're just showing you edited spliced together reality that's uh hopefully entertaining and viewers will watch 

133.92 137.06 A: uh the bachelor um [lipsmack] 

135.83 136.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

137.13 139.90 A: i saw the millionaire a little bit of that one 

139.95 141.03 B: yeah 

140.22 144.10 A: and that whole thing was staged and it was phony and i don't think uh 

144.30 152.56 A: oh wait i did see some of the bachelor that's right that's where the girls uh [lipsmack] yeah were uh hoping to get a proposal from somebody right 

151.90 153.05 B: (( yeah )) 

152.73 157.37 A: yeah yeah that's uh artificial i don't think anybody's expecting people to 

157.61 162.49 A: really fall in love and have a lasting bond uh [laughter] with with um 

160.39 163.23 B: (( yeah )) 

162.78 165.12 A: cameras watching i mean the whole 

165.96 168.18 A: the whole climate's artificial 

167.90 172.64 B: i mean what i find so interesting about the whole thing is that it's gotten this uh 

172.73 175.97 B: and there's this whole thing going on with language 

175.90 188.40 B: uh where thing- uh certain phenomena are are getting terminologies that actually are complete misnomers because to call this reality t._v. yes it is a new genre 

188.20 190.04 A: mhm 

188.32 194.11 B: um it is a new genre of t._v. but reality doesn't actually describe it because 

194.12 206.36 B: i mean for example like you know when was the last time you were invited uh with some kind of has been star to go on a deserted island and eat you know cockroaches or whatever as they do on 

204.93 213.14 A: [laughter] right that's true it's not it's not real life the way life actually is yeah you're right you're correct 

206.43 207.96 B: uh i mean 

210.10 211.69 B: yeah it's like 

212.52 222.14 B: um and i mean it's pre- it's [mn] it's [mn] all of it has kind of a bizarre twist and my own theory a little bit is that um 

222.05 226.28 B: with so much very heavy duty business going on in the world 

226.19 238.06 B: um there's a lot of this stuff coming out and i don't think it's like one grand plot um but either people want to get away from it or you know they the uh television producers 

238.49 249.45 B: want to help people get away from what's going on and they program the stuff that's totally escapist so it's actually in it's the inverse of reality the sort of opposite of reality it's like uh 

249.87 254.43 B: you know it's how how to sort of escape reality 

249.92 251.04 A: oh sort of like 

253.70 255.59 A: like modern fairy tales [noise] 

255.30 260.09 B: um yeah a little bit i mean certainly the bachelor from what i watch is total fairy tale i mean the guy's a 

260.25 270.74 B: the guy's a stud all you know very charming you know nice guy and all the girls are uh you know very attractive and you know you find their personality quirks um 

270.82 280.25 B: but uh you know in general it's like this guy's got a good selection the girls are all kind of uh kind of boxing out and trying to 

280.59 288.62 B: get at like the you know the world's richest guy and uh he happens to be sweet and sensitive too and it's like you know it's kind of 

288.88 297.09 B: not and then he has to after you know knowing someone for six weeks propose marriage and he's speaking like [lipsmack] like he really um 

297.63 305.32 B: [mn] you know like he really likes these people you know after only a few weeks it's it's uh i think it's a bit uh far fetched 

300.70 301.52 A: mm 

305.28 313.44 A: so you think uh [mn] the reason they're so popular is a little bit like bread and circuses from ancient times you know 

312.37 315.12 B: oh right like more like a stage uh 

315.39 327.57 B: just kind of like a carnival like a kind of flip flipped reality kind of flipped on its head a little bit to uh in that sense i don't um i don't know what the original bread and circus was 

327.31 330.72 A: oh back in ancient times back in ancient rome 

330.76 334.57 A: uh to take the people's mind of uh [mn] 

334.59 339.35 A: things that were going on like the wars and the fact that taxes were so high 

339.40 342.73 A: uh caesar would arrange for entertainment 

343.13 345.24 A: throw the christians to the lion 

344.81 345.82 B: (( uh-huh oh right )) 

345.36 349.85 A: the uh gladiators that kind of thing he called it bread and circuses 

350.02 355.28 A: uh just like you said you know it's a carnival atmosphere to take the people's mind off a things 

355.64 364.32 A: and in that that regard i i think you're correct yeah yeah look over here while all this bad stuff in the world's going on over there 

356.90 360.77 B: (( right )) 

364.38 366.86 A: 'cause there has to be a reason why they're so popular 

366.88 370.00 A: uh another thing too could be that the 

370.55 372.32 A: traditional shows 

372.42 379.13 A: have kind of run the course i mean how many different plots can you come up with in sitcoms and dramas i mean it's 

379.15 381.97 A: kind of rehashed so this is 

382.73 386.23 A: a novel form of you know entertainment 

385.87 392.04 B: [noise] [noise] yeah and there's so many um so many of them you know it's kind of uh 

389.85 391.35 A: yeah 

391.81 396.78 A: i don't know if that will will kill the genre i i kind of think it will i mean some of them are um 

397.61 401.27 A: like the one i i saw it once and i couldn't watch it after that 

401.30 406.73 A: uh you had touched on it where uh a has been star takes somebody out on a date 

406.86 409.26 A: and that was extremely uncomfortable 

409.25 410.45 B: oh really 

409.75 415.43 A: oh it was terrible it was [laughter] um [lipsmack] trying to think of the actor's name 

415.87 417.01 A: uh 

415.88 418.63 B: it wasn't emmanuelle lewis was it [laughter] 

417.99 422.65 A: no it was the other uh uh little boy who was in uh [lipsmack] 

422.00 424.85 B: gary coleman oh no 

422.68 423.90 A: gary coleman 

424.43 434.54 A: right and of course he was with um a white girl who was way too tall for him they were both uncomfortable and his life is um 

425.02 426.18 B: oh 

435.37 437.08 A: [lipsmack] difficult 

435.39 437.71 B: they just make a mockery of that guy 

437.47 443.73 A: yeah they did and that's what the whole event was about and that was the one and only show i watched because that's um 

444.60 458.46 A: that's not what i like i i don't like uh making fun of people i mean that [mn] see on survivors you know they're out there to win a prize and they're going to lie [mn] you know cheat whatever it's a game 

448.09 449.58 B: yeah 

458.64 464.10 A: but that was different that was uh extremely painful and hurtful to watch 

464.20 466.91 A: and uh he was trying his best to 

466.92 470.95 A: entertain the young lady and show her what his life was actually about 

471.10 473.82 A: uh he likes toys and trains and 

473.89 485.58 A: you know and she thought he was a cock and [sigh] [lipsmack] after the um the date was over she spoke at length about how she thought he was and it was all extremely negative and um 

485.69 487.70 A: [lipsmack] it it just um 

488.14 495.24 A: a dreadful thing that that type of a show so i i wouldn't watch that i like the i like the fantasy um 

492.80 494.63 B: yeah 

495.33 500.63 A: of the bachelor i mean the concept is sort of like uh cinderella or sleeping beauty you know the 

500.70 506.01 A: the handsome prince and all the beautiful girls um but that to me is just 

506.09 510.70 A: i don't buy into the fantasy that everyone will really find somebody and fall in love 

510.54 511.47 B: no 

510.82 513.10 A: it's uh it's just merely um 

513.21 514.53 A: a contest 

514.72 518.42 B: and uh do you do you know any 

518.55 527.22 B: um are there racial elements in the programs where they're sort of ignoring uh race or any um 

527.62 538.01 B: it [mn] or not ignoring it but again do you see do you see a preponderance of just you know kind of white folks and upper class white folks 

535.76 537.12 A: well they're 

537.38 541.53 A: uh again the only one that i've i've watched a little of the bachelor 

541.58 543.65 A: and i watched big brother 

544.19 553.39 A: i don't recall there being [sigh] uh more than one black person in the show i think in survivors last year there were two 

553.60 557.48 A: uh that started off and i believe they had an oriental 

557.54 559.79 A: um contestant too 

559.97 570.23 A: and that's not a microcosm of the way things are in my office uh we're really diversified i mean we have all kinds of people 

570.42 578.17 A: of different races and cultures and we all um more or less work well together but that's not represented in these shows yet 

578.73 585.65 A: and i don't know why that is um [lipsmack] certainly there's some wonderfully entertaining shows on that are 

585.66 589.65 A: black comedies uh so it's not the people won't watch them 

589.39 591.94 B: no definitely but uh i mean 

592.01 599.89 B: i mean i see that too where [mn] you've got you know i think it would be a stretch to imagine there's going to be a black reality series um
