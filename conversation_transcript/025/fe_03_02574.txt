49.39 53.15 B: yeah and i guess they're still looking though aren't they 

53.23 61.60 A: a for like uh the chemical weapons yes they haven't found those at least as far as i've heard i would imagine that would be a major headline if it

61.97 64.05 A: was found [laughter] so 

64.20 68.48 B: they basically haven't found any of the stuff that they went in there looking for right [noise] 

68.13 72.77 A: yeah and you know that kinda makes you wonder doesn't it [laughter] 

72.55 75.61 B: it does make you wonder did you see um 

75.85 78.22 B: colin powell's address that 

77.89 91.39 A: yeah that they definitely had a you know when he addressed the u._n. i saw that like in the morning and it was you know the when he went to the u._n. and they he showed all the evidence and they were like so sure that he had uh that they had it but 

88.37 89.18 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

91.36 95.79 A: wouldn't it have been easier to find if they're so sure that he they had it that's kinda 

96.47 97.71 A: what i think [mn] 

96.74 103.40 B: well you would think you would think it did [noise] it i thought it was [noise] pretty convincing his argument [noise]

110.24 113.35 B: i don't know what what the u._s. should do i mean 

113.39 114.38 B: because 

113.75 114.59 A: yeah 

114.39 117.16 B: i'm with you i think that the u._s. is 

116.08 121.14 A: because it plainly seems like they don't want us there [laughter] i mean you know 

120.00 121.70 B: yeah [laughter] 

121.17 127.83 A: and all the stuff they're showing on television that's all i have to go by i don't know anybody that's over there but it seems like you know 

128.51 131.66 A: they're just kind of like go away [laughter] like 

131.98 133.74 A: you know well maybe 

134.15 139.67 A: you know we haven't fou- maybe we haven't given it had enough time to find things either i don't know 

139.72 140.66 A: you know 

139.80 142.55 B: [noise] yeah you know it's only been what a month 

142.45 143.48 A: yeah 

142.99 144.53 B: two months maybe 

144.72 146.55 B: since the whole thing started

156.02 157.36 B: (( [noise] so )) 

158.98 162.91 B: maybe it just hasn't been enough time maybe they just need to keep looking 

163.31 167.20 B: 'cause i don't know i mean colin powell was saying that um 

168.27 174.90 B: that you know all this stuff had been scraped off the ground for you know chemical plants or chemical 

173.68 174.74 A: mhm 

175.05 179.11 B: that there is stuff that had been scraped off the ground [noise] and and 

179.14 185.33 B: it had been just scraped really deep and that was why they couldn't find anything originally [noise] something 

185.37 186.71 B: did you ever hear that 

187.58 199.98 A: yeah and i'd also heard that like even like when they sent u._n. weapons and in there the first time you know that it and they did destroy weapons you know in like what ninety after the ninety one 

200.71 203.14 A: whatever year that was that like 

200.94 202.35 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

204.79 206.79 A: [noise] i don't know 

206.90 207.72 A: like 

209.08 210.44 A: you know how long 

210.71 217.38 A: you know i guess we're all being a little bit impatient [laughter] too in a way expecting all this 

216.37 219.36 B: [noise] yeah i mean it's only been a month [laughter] 

218.92 220.65 A: yeah so 

221.29 222.31 A: um 

222.49 228.75 A: but i don't know i'm just really concerned because like they don't seriously want us there and you know 

229.99 234.99 B: well that's true but i'm i mean think about if if you were an iraqi 

235.01 237.25 B: and there are all these 

235.26 236.10 A: (( [mn] )) 

237.34 241.22 B: military people from another country coming in and 

241.28 247.03 B: they're all armed and they're you know all over they're visible in the streets and 

247.18 249.45 B: all that i don't think i would like it either [noise] 

249.36 250.36 A: yeah 

250.65 253.45 A: i mean i guess that's what i you know 

254.02 257.50 A: no i wouldn't like that i know i wouldn't but uh 

254.33 254.99 B: (( i )) 

257.57 258.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

259.07 259.81 A: (( so )) 

259.15 263.81 B: but you know they also it's so hard to tell you know from what the media 

264.03 269.33 B: shows us you know can you really trust the media it's so hard to tell because we 

268.62 269.29 A: (( [laughter] )) 

269.58 276.51 A: yeah i mean that's kind of a point you hear like a thirty second flip about something and then it's like 

274.81 276.06 B: [noise] 

276.48 277.67 B: i know and 

276.68 280.11 A: well what's the story about really you know 

280.10 287.75 B: right and they're all trying to advance their own agenda anyway [noise] you know some i think some media person somewhere has got 

283.85 284.83 A: yeah 

288.26 289.73 B: some opinion 

289.82 292.72 B: that he thinks is right or she or whatever 

292.52 293.47 A: mhm 

293.18 296.75 B: thinks is right and that's what they're going to promote 

296.93 297.90 A: yeah 

298.16 299.32 A: it could be 

299.58 301.92 B: but i don't know [laughter] 

301.98 303.31 A: (( yeah i )) 

303.52 305.97 A: well yeah i mean we're not over there i think 

305.92 306.73 B: [noise] 

307.83 311.67 B: yeah [noise] y- you hear [noise] some of them say that um 

312.49 318.84 B: that the iraqis are happy to have us there and then some of them are saying oh well no they don't want us over there 

318.82 323.14 A: what's the majority though of the people that's what's hard to find out so 

322.87 327.81 B: exactly not being over there what is the majority there's no way you can really know 

323.60 324.17 A: (( [mn] )) 

324.93 325.96 A: yeah 

328.28 329.10 A: (( so )) 

329.61 331.52 A: um let's see what else 

331.83 333.10 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

332.50 335.13 A: i don't know you know and then like you know what 

336.12 339.63 A: happened to saddam hussein where did he go [laughter] 

338.51 341.55 B: [noise] right 

340.19 350.81 A: wasn't that kinda i mean he's been overthrown but like can somebody can't somebody who's been overthrown come back into power too if they aren't able to locate them is he alive or dead 

351.37 356.99 B: that's that whole thing is just really weird i mean they thought they thought [noise] they got him twice right 

352.30 353.59 A: (( is he another )) 

357.02 359.49 A: yeah they thought like they you 

359.77 362.09 A: know that first night that they 

362.26 365.21 A: yeah we think we might have got him but we're not sure 

365.57 366.54 B: [noise] 

365.58 369.11 A: i mean it is hard to tell because like 

370.74 378.40 A: again you're back to what you hear on the news [laughter] you know they say that he moves round and all types of things like that but 

377.88 380.35 B: exactly and you know 

380.77 383.39 B: i don't know i'm i'm not um 

384.69 389.62 B: i i just wonder you know how much is is our government trying to hide from us too

402.42 404.94 B: right or you know maybe they really do 

403.59 405.06 A: and like our government 

405.55 408.79 A: said no we don't want 'em to go in it kinda leaves us to 

409.05 412.70 A: look like maybe you know working on the wrong thing [laughter] 

412.79 418.60 B: yeah and then again you know maybe they really do know where saddam hussein is 

418.51 420.70 A: well that could be [laughter] 

420.36 424.41 B: i mean uh well i don't know you know maybe he's 

424.03 431.62 A: i mean there was a lot of talk that like he has the possibility to go to another country and with an exile 

432.15 433.83 B: yeah that's true 

432.25 440.42 A: you know i can't see somebody that power hungry like doing that for a long t- as a long term thing [mn] you know
