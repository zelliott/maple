1.81 3.58 A: (( hi i'm sorry what's your name )) 

3.43 4.35 B: (( zoe )) 

4.42 5.43 A: [noise] kerry 

5.17 7.27 B: (( zoe z. o. e. [mn] )) 

6.86 8.22 A: (( zoe life )) 

8.59 10.00 B: yeah what's your name 

9.62 12.19 A: vivica sorry also means life 

11.99 13.58 B: oh that's cool [laughter] 

12.75 19.45 A: um yeah no you're my the second zoe i t- i've talked to today i just couldn't hear you my phone 

18.45 19.16 B: (( oh )) 

19.73 20.55 A: um 

20.59 23.63 A: [noise] so uh i guess this is my first 

23.77 25.03 A: call 

24.61 26.91 B: [mn] yeah this one's my second one so 

26.14 32.95 A: okay well it's my second but my boyfriend took the first one but he just talked about um things that irritate him in the street so 

32.46 34.07 B: [laughter] 

33.28 39.19 A: um i don't let's see what should the u._s. what do you think the u._s. should do about iraq 

38.90 44.58 B: um well personally i don't think they really should have gone in to begin with for the war 

44.20 45.34 A: mhm 

44.74 59.35 B: i think that at the time being i mean there's other issues that they should have taken care of like north korea and things and there's much bigger threats to the u._s. than iraq which really hadn't done anything that i can see that i mean 

59.37 65.26 B: is really outstanding to the u._s. directly that would make them go in and do the war 

65.32 76.89 A: [noise] no in fact i we were just talking today about somebody just asked us today a friend of mine who's i think from australia and he said what happened in that whole afghanistan thing i thought you guys were pissed off with afghanistan and we all went 

74.24 75.18 B: (( [mn] )) 

76.04 77.48 B: (( exactly )) 

76.94 84.63 A: um oh i guess we got distracted because it was harder to make up little slogans about afghanistan and they didn't rhyme so maybe 

83.85 86.22 B: [laughter] yeah 

85.75 86.72 A: um 

87.08 90.41 A: we decided to go for iraq instead but um 

90.49 93.91 A: we're not really sure what they what they did or why 

93.52 94.57 B: yeah 

94.36 100.16 A: my other line's ringing but i'm not gonna get it it's on my cellphone 'cause i can't do that so that's okay 

98.13 99.68 B: all right 

99.98 101.03 B: [laughter] 

100.64 102.22 A: (( um is that you )) 

102.92 104.55 A: (( [noise] [sigh] )) 

104.83 107.14 A: i thought it was him just trying to piss me off 

106.98 107.95 B: all right 

107.57 109.04 A: uh sorry okay 

108.25 110.62 B: (( um well let me see )) 

110.37 118.26 A: yeah so i am not a big i mean i guess i'm not as completely isolationist as i used to be in the sense that 

118.24 128.71 A: i do think there are things that countries can do either that threaten the u._s. or that are bad in and of themselves like the tortures in 

126.69 127.61 B: mhm 

128.80 130.69 A: in burundi or the ethnic 

131.24 138.78 A: cleansing in bosnia that like might be a legitimate reason for us to get involved but um i didn't 

138.91 144.71 A: know of anything like that happening in iraq and um having one 

145.02 147.67 A: attack on our country which was not 

148.01 154.12 B: not even directly related to it's not even like related to saddam hussein directly though that i mean 

148.30 150.79 A: sent by the government of iraq sorry 

153.89 154.63 A: right 

154.33 160.84 B: the things have nothing in common it's just it's ridiculous in my opinion yeah that we even went in the first place but 

157.97 158.83 A: right 

160.97 163.97 B: i guess they did and technically the people 

163.99 173.66 B: are free for [laughter] now i mean who knows how many of saddam's lea- leaders are still around and everything and his followers i mean you're gonna have to deal with that in years to come 

173.36 174.39 A: yeah 

173.77 184.71 B: and from what i know the u._s. doesn't plan on sticking around very long you know help support you know what's going on maybe in a couple of years or two but it's gonna take a lot longer than that to make sure everything's okay 

184.43 191.13 A: i mean yeah if if [noise] you have to build a government [noise] and that's a challenge and um 

187.63 188.57 B: yeah 

191.33 195.50 A: some of our ideas of what that are might not be necessarily what 

195.57 197.11 A: other people want it's 

197.46 199.68 A: not really up to us to impose it on them 

199.63 209.67 B: yeah i'm curious on what they what's gonna happen like if the u._n.'s going to restrict the uh united states at all since u._n. didn't give um permission or anything for 

209.88 220.01 B: going in on the war with it like that i mean the laws are built that way for the little people and once the big man goes out and you know goes against it then what's gonna happen sort of thing [laughter] 

219.91 223.47 A: it probably yeah i don't know what'll happen the u- i think the u._n. is 

223.58 230.33 A: like my sort of vague impression is that the u._n. is better than the u._s. at the um 

230.80 238.24 A: aftermath building and helping out and providing aid and that the u._s. will probably just go straight for another war somewhere else 

237.99 239.08 B: yeah 

238.45 242.41 A: um like attacking syria or um 

242.81 244.38 A: yeah i don't know what happened with 

244.39 247.75 A: afghanistan and osama bin laden that's all been kind of like 

247.80 248.84 A: forgotten 

248.70 249.75 B: yeah 

249.47 261.44 A: um and then they didn't even find any chemical weapons i mean this whole thing was about how we were trying to find they were breaking treaties and building chemical weapons and there's been no evidence of that whatsoever so 

261.24 262.26 B: yeah 

261.68 262.65 A: um 

262.82 264.42 A: again it's like this big 

264.96 270.76 A: distraction where um the whole thing turns out to have been misguided [noise] 

269.86 270.95 B: mhm 

271.09 271.91 A: um 

272.78 274.90 A: yeah [mn] 

273.98 277.86 B: yeah [mn] i remember earlier before they actually went into the war though they had um 

277.89 290.02 B: all those pictures and everything and proof of them building you know like the bomb areas and the missile launchers and everything those pictures could have been of anything they could have been a walmart built in you know like oklahoma or something you know 

288.82 294.23 A: [laughter] yeah i don't actually know like what chemical weapon plants look like 

290.09 291.28 B: (( uh it's just )) 

293.84 295.25 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

294.89 297.14 A: 'cause i've never really been in one myself 

296.91 302.07 B: yeah it just [sigh] it's just so ridiculous [mn] talking about the whole war thing i mean 

297.58 298.38 A: so 

302.26 309.99 B: i yeah i i've learned quite a bit about it i mean i've participated in all kinds of peace rallies and marches and things and where i'm from 

309.85 310.76 A: where are you 

310.67 312.05 B: i'm in seattle 

311.61 312.28 A: oh 

312.43 313.61 B: yeah where are you 

313.32 314.51 A: i'm in new york 

314.21 317.77 B: oh [mn] the last person i talked to was in new york also 

317.46 318.21 A: huh 

318.19 319.29 B: (( but um )) 

319.72 325.84 B: yeah i so i i mean i learned quite a bit about it which was pretty good um 

325.97 328.82 B: kinda forget forgetting what i was going at 

328.39 329.40 A: (( oh sorry )) 

329.03 330.30 B: um 

331.30 332.50 B: (( hm )) 

333.78 335.55 B: (( hm [laughter] )) 

334.44 342.64 A: [noise] yeah i haven't been as i've been in kind of a media vacuum i just i was um i was away from home for a few months and 

342.74 350.20 A: in some other places like the last place i was i i didn't have any t._v. and but even when i'm home i just don't 

350.46 352.40 A: really follow very well and 

352.63 361.34 A: i don't follow anything like i have sort of ideas but i don't stay up to date like i m- missed a plane 'cause i didn't know it was daylight savings time and i'm just kind of in my own 

361.57 363.26 A: world a lot 

362.96 364.06 B: mhm 

363.39 365.87 A: um but it's like i check in and then 

365.96 368.89 A: i check in and then it's like oh well bush 

368.92 374.55 A: is saying that there's a threat and that if you don't disclose a chemical weapon you know and then 

374.60 375.95 A: the next thing 

376.67 381.20 A: it's like well that didn't happen it's like it just keeps never falling 

381.20 390.93 A: never happening what he's saying and my mum goes to lots of the peace rallies and i found it very a lot of people i know do i found it very discouraging that bush said that he didn't 

390.92 396.66 A: believe in liste- that it would be irresponsible for him to listen to what the people wanted because the people don't know what's best for them 

396.39 399.50 B: [mn] yeah i agree i thought that was ridiculous 

399.88 402.20 B: what's best for democracy is 

402.24 405.33 B: [mn] what the people aren't voting for and it's yeah mm 

405.50 408.31 A: yeah i think that should you know pretty much be up to us 

408.10 409.10 B: mhm 

408.45 409.29 A: um 

409.50 412.41 A: and that he's supposed to represent 

412.43 415.13 A: what we want and he's clearly not 

415.29 416.41 A: doing that 

416.31 417.27 B: mhm 

416.67 417.46 A: um 

418.16 419.40 A: but [noise] 

419.85 422.68 A: i don't know i mean it's true that i don't follow 

422.78 424.25 A: [noise] i'm not as 

424.33 433.85 A: informed i hope as [noise] the president i mean i hope he knows [noise] more but um he hasn't put a very good [noise] argument forward [noise] for what he's doing yet [noise] so 

433.70 434.61 B: mhm 

434.92 435.80 A: so 

436.00 436.58 A: (( [noise] )) 

436.66 437.73 A: (( i don't know )) 

437.90 443.67 B: yeah i don't yeah mm i wonder if there's any like going to be any uh 

443.85 446.01 B: smaller attacks or anything on 

446.03 450.00 B: on america with things like anthrax or small things 

447.32 448.97 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

450.04 451.77 B: going round that that way 

450.12 451.50 A: (( [noise] [noise] sars [noise] )) 

452.02 453.12 A: um 

454.32 458.41 A: i don't know [noise] i do think i don't think that the measures that 

458.48 459.41 A: um 

459.96 469.39 A: the u._s. is taking to stop terrorism are really [noise] remotely relevant to what would happen like i think that stuff on [noise] airplanes is ridiculous and not 

469.47 470.67 A: helpful [noise] 

470.47 471.43 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

470.81 477.09 A: um [noise] but i don't think that [noise] um 

478.56 487.23 A: but i do think we do a lot of things that piss people off and that that would [noise] be a more likely target and it also seems to me like um here you you pick one 

487.31 488.65 A: (( [noise] um )) 

490.06 494.64 A: um it seems that i lost my train of thought too [sigh] 

494.54 505.63 A: oh yeah that people who are like well you know now just because we're going to war maybe there'll be another terrorist attack [noise] and i'm going well i don't really understand [noise] what the difference between [noise] this one okay thanks [noise] 

505.53 513.09 A: i don't really understand what the difference between our bombing [noise] them being a war and [noise] their bombing us being [noise] terrorism is [noise] like it seems like 

511.73 512.87 B: exactly 

513.13 518.99 A: it seems like it's okay as long as it's [noise] not on our you can come in here and let him lie down 

519.49 525.18 A: um as long as it's as long as it's not in america then if it's in america then it's uh 

525.63 526.69 A: terrorism 

526.42 531.49 B: exactly what did poor innocent america do to get that [laughter] yeah 

530.16 531.25 A: yeah 

531.56 533.96 B: mm especially considering like 

533.91 538.47 B: [mn] i know the naval base like are right it's over from where i live 

538.42 539.47 B: um 

539.33 547.30 B: there oh there's so many bombs and things there i mean there's probably more just in that one spot than the rest of the world has planted everywhere else 

547.16 552.09 B: it's it's just ridiculous and the amounts of anthrax we have and just the amount of 

551.95 566.89 B: chemical warfare that we could cause on the whole world i- it's just it's chaos [laughter] i don't know i i'm curious like if anything's gonna happen in the future like what day exactly the end of the world is gonna come down to 

552.65 554.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

557.71 558.94 A: (( wow [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

567.06 574.72 B: i mean who's gonna fire off what first if somebody fires off some huge chemical warfare it's probably just gonna spread to the rest of the world and 

575.40 582.51 B: allies will go in with one another and maybe that'll be it i don't know if i don't know if anyone's that crazy that would want 

577.75 579.91 A: [noise] [noise] well 

582.30 584.52 A: i don't know i mean i was more 

584.69 589.52 A: worried about that in the seventies when everybody talked about nuclear warfare and it was the 

589.60 593.57 A: superpowers in the u._s. and russia at the time 

592.69 593.80 B: mhm 

593.59 598.28 A: and those were like big weapons with big fall out i mean chemical warfare 

598.42 599.95 A: is sort of the opposite
