19.67 30.17 A: you know i agree because i really never did get into them my own self i think when survivor came on i watched two or three of 'em they got survivor two three and four and i said i'm done 

23.32 24.17 B: yeah 

27.08 27.79 B: (( mm [mn] )) 

29.73 30.93 B: [laughter] 

30.35 36.88 A: [laughter] they did a yeah the who wants to be who wants to marry a millionaire i thought well that's kind of stupid 

31.56 32.48 B: yeah 

36.60 46.30 B: yeah you know i have to say though i used to um it's been a few years watch um m._t._v.'s real world [mn] 

45.79 47.34 A: (( [mn] oh that )) 

47.19 51.79 B: when it first started um i watched the f- maybe the first or second season 

48.81 49.59 A: uh-huh 

51.59 52.37 A: uh-huh 

51.93 59.14 B: um but that kind of preceded some of these later shows so i didn't really think about that but i did use to watch that 

58.89 62.41 A: yeah that one's all right now i once in a while i'll the catch the osbournes 

62.02 63.31 B: mhm 

62.82 68.05 A: and they're all right you know they're they're more for the the evening type children not to watch 

67.78 68.75 B: sure 

68.07 70.94 A: but it you know i'll catch them once in a while but um 

71.19 80.10 A: i don't know some of the other ones that they came out with i just i thought were you know a little much uh big brother that that one i think went went a little too far 

76.03 77.00 B: mhm 

79.94 82.77 B: yeah i think i've seen one of those before too [laughter] 

80.19 81.05 A: (( you know )) 

82.22 96.20 A: yeah where everybody's in the house living together and you watch them twenty four seven online and they get voted off and stuff yeah i think that's really hard on the the people's families that are that have to wait for this person that's locked up in that house for however long they're in there 

86.51 87.80 B: exactly 

88.63 89.48 B: yeah 

95.89 98.77 B: sure yeah that's a good point 

97.56 98.35 A: so 

98.85 102.57 B: yeah and not only that it makes them kind of um 

102.96 105.37 B: do ridiculous things for money 

105.34 106.19 A: (( [mn] i know )) 

105.45 116.88 B: you know it's kind it's not really entertaining that's kind of low you know that people would have to do some of the things that they wind up doing and then other people are watching you know yeah 

116.01 121.90 A: yeah yes i agree [noise] now fear factor have you seen that one [noise] 

120.82 123.79 B: actually i've only seen the commercials i've never seen the program 

123.51 126.02 A: no actually fear factor is not bad 

125.80 126.82 B: okay 

126.23 133.89 A: [noise] considering for the reality t._v.s you know they they actually do um these stunts and stuff that actual people like i i used to hang off of win- uh 

133.76 142.13 A: [mn] storey buildings and wash windows so i yeah i i watch these guys doing this and i laugh to myself thinking you know it's the height that kills 'em 

136.07 137.12 B: oh wow 

141.85 142.83 B: yeah 

142.13 149.54 A: on some of this stuff but you know i think you know tha- tha- that that's worth it 'cause you're doing something and at the end you're going to get money 

149.29 150.28 B: right 

149.63 151.44 A: and it's all a physical thing 

151.35 162.67 B: sure yeah there may be some skill involved rather than just you know kind of hanging out and persevering through ridiculous situations to earn money yeah 

154.95 156.88 A: (( uh yeah )) 

161.20 163.67 A: right and and causing drama 

163.26 165.60 B: right and cau- exactly [laughter]

167.61 168.94 A: [laughter] 

168.10 173.07 B: yeah no i don't i i think the reality t._v. shows um 

173.45 179.88 B: kind of exemplify lack of creativity on the part of some of the the networks and the t._v. producers 

174.91 178.25 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

178.44 179.44 A: uh yes 

179.50 180.74 A: yes i agree 

180.35 192.77 B: you know i mean they just throw these people together and they don't really have to think too hard about what the script should be there is no script you know there is no story there's no plot um they just have to do ridiculous stuff to earn money 

189.88 191.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

192.08 198.01 A: [noise] [noise] right now they they did do one one kind of t._v. shoot show up in east portman 

198.00 198.97 B: mhm 

198.22 205.16 A: i can't it was uh a mystery thing where these where it is supposed to be like reality t._v. where the people were supposed to find who the murderer was

214.98 218.30 A: this is just when the reality t._v. shows were just getting ready to come out 

218.25 220.32 B: oh i hadn't heard about that one 

219.82 222.98 A: yeah well uh it wasn't really popular 

223.00 224.01 B: (( okay )) 

223.00 230.38 A: it it came out after survivor and like i said it was like so they they took so many kids they went up to east portman it was a murder thing 

230.37 242.25 A: and everybody in it was actors because i used to live up there so i knew who all the police officers were and all the regulars and everybody in that whole series was planted not one person was a regular up from up there in east portman 

235.92 236.81 B: wow 

239.44 240.20 B: [laughter] 

241.91 254.08 B: oh that's terrible that's really terrible yeah but that reminds of um p._b._s. now is doing it's kind of like the reality show but it's a historical program where 

243.14 244.58 A: yeah it wasn't real 

253.04 253.95 A: (( [noise] )) 

253.95 259.37 B: people live in a situation that's supposed to be like the past they live in 

258.04 259.90 A: oh th- that would be cool 

259.48 264.36 B: yeah they live in a log cabin uh this one family it's like a frontier family 

264.11 264.99 A: uh-huh 

264.40 269.66 B: and i think there's one that they live in a victorian home and it's supposed to be the victorian era 

265.01 266.81 A: [noise]

270.08 276.57 A: oh was this where they were going to put like hillbillies up like in beverley hill like they did like with the um you you remember the old series they had 

275.54 278.63 B: sure i think it's something like that yeah 

276.90 286.89 A: hillbillies yeah do you know i think that one that would be a little interesting and worth watching i don't yeah i don't think they have it out here yet and if they do i've missed it but i think that would be worth 

281.56 283.32 B: sure yeah 

284.73 285.29 B: (( [mn] )) 

285.49 286.30 B: right 

287.05 294.82 A: (( [noise] it )) 

287.22 293.19 B: yeah i i haven't actually watched it but i've seen commercials where uh they're trying to do that type of thing 

293.22 297.82 B: and it sounds a lot more interesting than than what they have on on the other channels 

294.86 296.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

297.41 303.61 A: right now what do you think about this reality uh t._v. station they're going to come up with have you heard about that 

303.01 305.50 B: i didn't hear about that [sigh] [mn] 

304.73 311.31 A: yeah they are the networks are [noise] putting together a twenty four seven one station that's nothing but all reality shows 

311.16 322.20 B: well oh unfortunately i think it's terrible because [laughter] i just don't think it's interesting i don't and i think it's kind of low i mean there's something about it that just seems really 

311.89 312.98 A: (( [laughter] )) 

314.22 315.68 A: (( i know )) 

321.10 324.45 A: there's a lot of stuff that we don't get to see that they're cutting out 

323.07 325.64 B: yeah sure yeah 

325.09 336.90 A: and if it's going to be a reality it should be all of it like they did like in big brother instead of taking the best pieces and just s- sticking them up there to keep your attention instead of getting to see really what's going on behind the scenes 

329.85 330.56 B: mm 

336.70 338.37 B: right yeah 

338.44 350.58 B: um you know as a matter of fact i have heard about this new movie now they have uh something about going to cancun and the [noise] students uh just go on a spring break and

350.73 352.10 B: that's yeah 

354.10 355.70 B: exactly 

358.45 368.13 B: i can't believe it either i can't believe people want to why you know i guess it makes more sense to watch it than participate but it really sounded just terrible you know 

363.84 366.64 A: [laughter] [noise] right 

367.61 371.50 A: well well to be but see i have to agree with them though th- [mn] 

370.89 372.06 B: mhm

412.77 413.62 B: [noise]

439.52 440.42 B: okay 

439.99 449.65 A: too bad but uh now that might be interesting a real a reality reality t._v. series in los angeles because there's so many different aspects and so many so many different people 

445.92 447.43 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

447.58 448.49 B: [laughter] 

449.59 458.24 B: oh yes there's a lot of [laughter] i'm not i've only been here a few years so it it comes it came as a a surprise to me i didn't know what to expect 

450.29 452.76 A: [laughter] 

456.07 457.76 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

458.50 465.03 A: hollywood is just blows your mind that would be yeah that'd be a good reality every street is like [noise] different types of people 

460.68 462.06 B: oh yeah 

464.80 466.11 B: (( exactly )) 

465.25 469.67 A: so yeah i think that'd be a good reality series to intermix all of them together and see what happens 

468.25 472.33 B: there's so many neighborhoods here that each one is just so different 

471.99 473.83 A: mhm i agree i agree 

472.55 473.52 B: (( you know )) 

473.53 474.97 B: yeah 

474.84 475.40 A: (( [mn] )) 

475.82 479.27 A: i wonder for how long how our ten minutes is doing we're getting pretty close 

478.50 482.64 B: [mn] we must be yeah we must be getting close yeah but uh 

479.97 480.75 A: yeah 

480.91 481.83 A: yeah 

483.03 484.39 B: so you're thumbs 

484.53 486.64 B: down on the reality 

485.24 489.11 A: yeah basically i think so yeah i'm not big on 'em either 

486.79 488.42 B: okay yeah 

488.90 494.54 B: yeah neither am i i think they could be a little more creative with it and you know maybe something 

493.79 495.03 A: [noise] 

495.17 500.11 B: reality based could be interesting but so far i haven't seen anything that's sparked my interest 

499.77 502.40 A: mhm no i agree me neither me neither 

501.84 503.22 B: yeah 

502.72 513.06 A: uh even though they have some of the um reality dating little series that's are on you know they take 'em on dates and they show you the whole date and yay or nays and i think those are pretty boring too so 

506.40 507.60 B: oh yeah 

512.38 513.80 B: (( [mn] sure )) 

513.77 517.12 A: now they need they do i agree they need to find a different aspect on 

516.91 518.97 B: mm definitely yeah 

518.66 521.30 A: it [noise] we're just so programmed to watching 

521.35 522.20 B: mm 

521.67 532.44 A: all of this action packed real movie stuff that that's why the reality shows are becoming so big 'cause it's something different [noise] and we're tired of seeing the same stuff everyday 

528.91 530.10 B: (( yeah like )) 

532.29 534.13 B: right yeah 

534.45 535.25 B: (( mm )) 

535.50 538.18 B: yeah well hopefully hollywood will 

538.40 541.92 B: you know become a little more uh creative and 

540.58 543.61 A: [laughter] [noise] un- unfortunate- 

542.14 544.33 B: instead of doing the same old stuff 

544.23 548.53 A: i agree but i think right now they're stuck in that reality [noise] phase until something else comes along 

548.02 552.95 B: yeah since they're thinking of a whole channel i mean that's that's major 

548.80 550.14 A: [laughter] 

551.57 557.52 A: yeah [mn] yeah it is cable t._v. i couldn't believe it i heard it like three days ago i almost fell over i thought 

557.52 569.50 A: you know they're going what are they going to do rerun uh who wants to marry a millionaire the bachelor the bachelorette [noise] all the survivors you know what i mean this is all i can think about [mn] we've we've lived it once 

563.87 564.76 B: (( uh-huh )) 

569.48 570.76 B: yeah 

570.11 571.43 A: [laughter] 

570.96 580.37 B: exactly i i think probably you know i'm sure we're not the only ones who even if we used to watch it whoever used to watch it they're getting tired of the same old thing so 

579.83 592.62 A: [mn] right that's true that's true and there and i know that there's some like my neighbors are followers they're big survivor fans but after a while it get it does it gets old you know and you think well you know besides the challenges all being different it's still the same scenario 

583.67 584.62 B: mhm 

585.12 586.17 B: oh yeah 

592.28 595.79 B: yeah you know what i do watch um 

595.87 599.95 B: uh i don't know if it's reality and i didn't start watching until late 

598.81 599.37 A: (( [noise] ))
