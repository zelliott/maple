0.30 2.07 A: hi this is val 

2.29 4.01 B: erin de paulo 

4.03 5.24 A: hi erin 

5.48 6.76 A: it's nice to meet you 

6.71 7.78 B: you too 

8.75 11.50 A: [sigh] we're going to talk about iraq today huh 

11.43 12.58 B: mhm 

12.40 18.27 A: okay i don't really know that much about it i don't watch the news very much but um 

19.42 20.51 A: what about you 

21.25 23.98 B: uh i know quite a bit i guess 

23.46 24.56 A: okay 

24.98 26.17 B: [laughter] 

25.43 29.42 A: [laughter] okay well maybe you could help me out a little bit and and start then 

31.08 32.31 B: okay 

32.57 34.67 B: what should i say [laughter] 

33.61 36.17 A: [cough] mm is this the first time you've done this 

35.74 36.83 B: yes 

36.21 41.21 A: okay i understand exactly what you mean i've done this a couple of times um 

41.40 52.25 A: well they asked us if what we think that the united states should do about iraq and if disarming iraq should be a major issue 

52.28 54.62 B: okay i believe it should be 

54.74 55.48 A: okay 

54.77 61.05 B: um and i believe what i believe what we have done with the war and everything was um 

61.32 62.90 B: very appropriate 

63.14 63.99 A: uh-huh 

64.59 67.35 A: okay well i i think that with 

67.77 75.35 A: um disarming them i think i'm hoping what they what they generally mean is um trying to find all of the 

75.39 84.19 A: all of the things that they feel were in the country the weapons they had and things like that and i think if they don't do that then 

79.72 81.26 B: yes yes 

84.42 88.50 A: all the other effort that they've put forth so far is going to be for nothing 

88.20 91.77 B: right right they need to follow through with with that 

88.90 90.10 A: because 

91.35 95.25 A: because some some fanatic is going to come up with 

95.43 103.58 A: finding something and not only oppress the people again but also cause problems for other countries 

102.93 104.92 B: right i agree with that 

104.49 110.69 A: so if they don't go ahead and finish the steps i think it's going to be a real real problem 

110.28 114.98 B: right right and i i feel like they are going to finish it this time 

114.60 122.62 A: yeah well that would that would probably be a cred- well not a probably it will be a credit to uh president bush 

122.27 123.25 B: yes 

122.75 137.24 A: in in that he was determined to make sure that even if they didn't find anything right away or if it wasn't a success right away that he still was going to see it through until it was completely finished 

136.89 138.04 B: yes 

137.42 141.01 A: and i think that's what he's pretty much going to do from what i understand 

139.57 142.84 B: i think so that's what i think [laughter] 

141.60 154.45 A: yeah yeah it just seems that way it just seems that way although i know that it's it's very difficult for them because a lot of people didn't want to be or they don't maybe they don't understand exactly what it'll mean for them 

143.79 144.78 B: yes 

154.40 157.08 A: but it seems like they didn't wanna be set free 

156.85 157.97 B: right 

157.70 167.88 A: so i think that's something that has to be worked out and of course trying to keep track of how the people in the united states feel and the people in iraq feel is kind of a difficult situation 

165.30 166.36 B: right 

167.71 169.95 B: yes definitely 

169.64 176.47 A: but i think it's going to take a lot of effort on a lot of people's parts and a lot of sacrifices are still going to have to be made 

171.76 172.91 B: mhm 

176.15 179.84 B: right it's gonna it's gonna take some time for sure 

177.29 178.04 A: so 

179.37 182.54 A: yeah patience is going to be definitely needed 

182.18 183.37 B: mhm 

182.71 184.31 A: in this situation 

184.60 185.65 A: um 

185.78 192.86 A: i don't like i said i don't know that much about it i know that they're having some problems now with people um demonstrating 

193.24 200.29 A: i guess is what you call it and um some problems with that but i think they need to really focus on 

200.72 203.48 A: [sigh] making the people feel comfortable 

203.34 204.42 B: right 

204.53 208.66 B: yeah i think there's i think there's prob- i'm sure there's a trust issue 

204.57 206.54 A: maybe is the word 

208.73 210.95 B: you know with them trusting us 

210.25 211.20 A: yes 

211.11 218.01 B: and also you know how much freedom they really have because we don't really know if saddam is alive or 

217.92 219.41 B: or dead and 

218.72 219.63 A: right 

219.31 227.04 B: the people are so used to being oppressed by him and having to say certain things so that they're not killed [laughter] so 

225.44 227.19 A: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

226.81 236.68 B: you know i think that i think that they're just trying to i think a lot of the people are probably just so used to being oppressed that they don't know how to act free they don't know what it's like to be free 

234.31 235.26 A: right 

236.14 237.09 A: yeah 

236.77 237.76 B: so 

237.37 243.39 A: i know we were talking um earlier about making sure that they have the necessities of life 

244.36 258.55 A: you know that the united states is making sure that they have their water and their electric and and things like that and if they can get their food and it's not going to be a situation where they're going to be afraid to go and get something um that their family needs 

247.36 248.59 B: right 

256.20 257.34 B: right 

258.13 259.19 B: right 

258.79 265.89 A: and i think that probably will help a lot to make it possible to continue to disarm 

266.42 268.26 A: where they find something 

268.10 269.24 B: right 

269.11 275.04 A: and maybe they'll maybe the the individual people will be able to trust 

275.11 280.66 A: the ones that are there that are really there to help 'em even though they have the idea that they're not there to help 'em 

280.03 283.70 B: exactly exactly they'll i think that 

283.65 296.82 B: as we build trust and they see things you know positive things happening that they'll see it as being a good thing i think the majority of 'em i think there'll still be some that just feel like we have no right to be there no matter what 

296.14 302.36 A: yeah yeah well we have fanatic we have fanatic people in all societies i guess so i guess that would work 

300.71 303.89 B: yeah [laughter] yes we do 

303.13 308.06 A: we don't think we have 'em here [noise] but we do [laughter] [laughter] 

305.10 309.22 B: oh of course we do of course we do definitely 

308.70 311.05 A: [laughter] we like to think we don't have 'em anyway 

310.81 312.70 B: right right 

311.74 317.11 A: [laughter] but there are people that just feel that they want to stand up on their own and that they can't do that 

316.80 317.97 B: right 

317.49 331.29 A: because of who they have but they have a lot don't they have a lot of the well i'm a lot i don't know what a lot is in this case but they have a few of the high ranking officials in custody right 

330.20 334.55 B: yes they do yes they do they have several and there's um 

335.02 338.48 B: i guess a couple of them voluntarily turned themselves in 

337.76 338.64 A: uh-huh 

338.61 346.12 B: and then there were a few that they just you know that they captured and then there's a there's several that are dead so um 

344.05 344.94 A: yeah 

346.20 358.39 B: that's that's a good thing i think that they're seeing that they're you know they're on a sinking ship [laughter] and that there's no use in you know i mean if they're gonna they're either gonna be for us or against us 

351.66 353.95 A: yeah yeah 

358.46 371.76 A: well i would think that i would want to be um have better terms than being captured against my will and having things go badly for me i think i would want to be cooperative and have things go a little easier for me 

358.75 359.60 B: so 

371.21 372.60 B: definitely 

372.04 374.69 A: [laughter] i think i would go that route 

372.64 380.68 B: [laughter] yeah i mean i think i think that they're seeing that that's the you know that they can't really be successful in fighting the united states so 

379.51 380.86 A: yeah 

381.25 384.05 A: but you know one of the things that is 

384.17 389.60 A: of um are of question to me is the people 

390.07 393.24 A: having the weapons wherever they are 

393.26 394.28 A: um 

394.84 398.12 A: and still coming up with some kind of 

398.44 399.86 A: way of fighting 

400.89 415.41 A: you know even with a small band of people being able to because of the because of the fact that they can get these more fanatical people there and coming up and starting to fight again and causing problems and o- oppressing the people again 

415.26 416.33 B: right 

415.90 422.17 A: that that's one thing that i think would be really hard for them once they got in to where they could 

422.41 425.40 A: taste freedom again because it's been so long 

423.83 424.88 B: right 

425.31 426.33 B: right 

426.69 434.42 A: so i guess i guess the move is the g- the good thing the united states is doing is trying to find them i g- guess that will combat that 

426.92 428.13 B: yeah 

434.00 435.88 B: right right 

435.35 436.64 A: (( now okay )) 

436.38 448.56 B: i mean i think that there'll always i mean there'll always be the you know like you said the fanatics and the terrorists you know the the terrorist cells throughout you know especially in the middle east 

442.63 443.56 A: yeah 

447.88 448.94 A: yeah 

448.56 454.57 B: but you know i think that they the main goal was just to get saddam out of there and establish a new 

454.59 465.26 B: um a new rule you know with with decent people in there so i think i think they'll you know of course they'll have their their terrorists still but 

456.80 457.76 A: yeah 

459.04 460.08 A: yeah 

464.61 465.56 A: right 

465.34 468.51 B: overall i think you know the goal is to make it a 

468.61 472.58 B: peaceful um peaceful place to be 

472.20 475.25 A: yeah a n- nice place to live again 

473.01 473.93 B: so 

474.95 477.64 B: yeah [laughter] exactly 

475.81 476.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

477.05 481.75 A: i guess all the old people would know what it was like but none of the young people know what it's like 

481.43 482.48 B: no 

482.12 486.72 A: so they they are they're all messed up about what what is really 

486.77 492.55 A: important or what is freedom or any of those things they don't know what that any of that is at all 

487.59 488.99 B: right 

490.67 491.82 B: right 

491.96 499.47 B: they don't they don't know what they don't know what it's like to live to live in a free type environment 

498.82 501.38 A: yeah [lipsmack] i guess i 

499.66 502.16 B: so it'll be interesting 

501.81 511.40 A: yeah i i think it will i think it's going to be a a patient issue like like we said before it's going to be taking steps little steps a little bit at a time 

506.22 509.15 B: definitely definitely 

509.62 516.08 B: yeah it's not a it's not a go in there and fix everything in a couple of months it's going to be a long long thing 

513.68 514.85 A: well 

515.69 523.63 A: well that's just like everybody kept saying you know when's the war going to end w- when's the war going to end and i was like it's only been going on for five days people you know give 'em 

521.79 527.92 B: oh i know i know [laughter] nothing like those other wars that we had you know 

527.38 529.31 A: [mn] it's like a mess 

527.98 529.43 B: it's amazing 

529.44 535.39 A: well we got every step of the way you know every every time you turn the t._v. on you had something 

534.96 536.15 B: right 

535.27 545.73 A: and you got to see everything and one of things that amazed me and i guess i didn't pay attention too much during the other gulf war i i don't know but it just seems like there was a lot of accidents this time 

545.79 551.69 A: where people died where where soldiers were killed and i just thought that was so sad 

547.47 548.58 B: yeah 

549.18 550.20 B: i think 

551.08 559.57 B: i think that ha- i think that that happened in the in the gulf war too i think that that's just you're always going to have that element you know 

558.15 564.08 A: yeah i just don't think you heard about it as much or i just wasn't paying as much attention which it very well could be 

563.64 568.68 B: yeah well we were all a lot younger then [laughter] 

566.83 571.85 A: yeah well that's true i was younger then hm yeah [laughter] 

569.74 574.59 B: [laughter] that's something we all have in common we were all younger then so 

572.66 577.84 A: yeah yeah and we didn't pay attention as much i think and uh 

576.37 580.30 B: yeah this one i think was more was much more um 

580.31 586.98 B: publicized just because you know we have more more ways to keep up on it the internet and everything 

581.16 582.03 A: yeah 

585.64 586.44 A: yeah 

586.47 593.55 A: yeah oh no it seemed like all the time on the news where before it didn't seem like they interrupted as much 

587.18 588.19 B: so 

589.59 590.71 B: yeah 

593.66 599.89 A: things as much or something i i don't know i guess they just wanted people to know what was going on more 

598.99 599.89 B: yeah
