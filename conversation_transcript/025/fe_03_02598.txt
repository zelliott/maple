0.78 2.02 B: hello 

1.37 3.09 A: hi i'm jan 

2.85 4.79 B: i'm regina it's nice to meet you 

4.35 6.10 A: hi you too regina 

6.52 8.94 A: uh so what do you think about the topic 

8.89 18.43 B: well since they've already went in there and had the war [laughter] i'm pretty sure they're in the process of disarming iraq [laughter] 

12.24 14.19 A: right [laughter] 

16.64 21.08 A: yes and and i think that it should be a top a top priority 

21.09 22.45 B: right 

21.83 30.90 A: uh i think that the uh forces we've still got in place over there should be doing all they can to find the ones that were probably hidden in 

31.41 34.79 A: you know saudi arabia or wherever 

34.41 39.84 B: right well i was really surprised by the behavior of the iraqi people i mean i didn't 

39.38 40.83 A: uh well yeah 

39.97 44.06 B: i didn't expect that they would loot and all that kind of stuff 

43.51 44.71 A: yeah 

44.11 46.77 B: i was kind of taken by surprise by that 

46.10 54.94 A: well i i really wasn't because that's very typical in a wartime situation i think it's happened in probably all the wars but as far as 

50.57 51.76 B: yeah 

54.91 66.08 A: you know as far as the weapons i do believe that that they did have weapons of mass destruction and i believe that they were taken out of the country and that's why i think it's a top priority we should 

66.04 72.11 A: pursue that as m- as heartily as we're still op- pursuing osama bin laden you know 

71.13 73.00 B: right right 

72.39 79.59 A: keep keep uh covert ops people over there whatever we have to do and the money is insubstantial to me 

79.22 80.33 B: right 

79.66 82.65 A: you know whatever it costs because uh 

82.75 93.03 A: the the original george bush did not finish the job over there and that's we've lost over a hundred men and in their honor you know our 

86.57 87.56 B: yeah 

93.31 97.57 A: our procedure should be completed over there you know so 

96.64 102.48 B: mm yeah i agree and not only that but the people seem to be genuinely happy to see him 

102.58 106.96 B: uh being taken down if he's dead or whatever they seem to really be happy 

106.53 107.66 A: right 

107.57 114.17 B: um i i just thought maybe there was a little more solidarity among those people but i guess [sigh] there really wasn't 

107.69 108.90 A: right 

113.82 124.63 A: well it seems to me like they they just kinda go with the flow and turn with whatever is there for them at the time because they're obviously living in desperation 

117.83 118.96 B: right 

120.86 122.01 B: right 

124.18 127.88 B: right and they were being terrorized and tortured and whatever 

126.04 127.10 A: right 

127.36 137.58 A: right and you know mass destruction weapons were used against them so why wouldn't i mean i i really you know i've i know i've spoke with people who say well they you know 

131.06 132.18 B: right 

137.66 140.94 A: good lord i i can't believe their attitude well 

140.97 144.97 A: we're we haven't lived like they've lived for twenty years 

144.03 145.41 B: exactly 

145.05 150.31 A: uh under weapons of mass destruction you know [laughter] yeah and torture 

146.42 147.69 B: duress 

148.17 149.76 B: right 

150.37 151.34 A: so 

151.68 155.10 B: and i guess we were just really being um 

154.97 168.62 B: subjected to propaganda to believe that they were all as one on these issues because i really believed that you know they all believed all this stuff that that you know they'd have newscasts and they'd talk to people on the street and they'd be like oh ya ya ya 

168.86 172.54 B: but i guess that really wasn't the case which is good 

172.07 173.12 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

172.77 177.23 B: that's good because my god how scary that they could all be these fanatics you know 

176.53 177.84 A: mhm mhm 

177.84 182.36 B: and no no matter if you took him down or not i was beginning to wonder if they'd ever be 

182.00 183.32 A: right 

182.66 187.63 B: but i guess that's good that they aren't all of the one mind like 

187.00 198.86 A: a- yeah and in in point that you mentioned that there are radical factions still there again is just another good example of why we should you know find all the weapons we can 

198.47 200.10 B: oh i agree 

199.46 201.71 A: and i believe that there are 

201.73 215.05 A: as i say if they've not i think they've been taken to the other surrounding countries there but i think that there's probably still some or some evidence of some that's buried or something there that we just haven't found yet you know 

212.78 213.98 B: mhm 

214.94 215.94 B: right 

215.27 221.53 A: uh we live in a day and age where everybody wants their big mac in one minute or less you know 

220.74 222.94 B: oh yeah absolutely 

222.47 223.80 A: and uh 

224.03 226.68 A: you know the american people are like well you know 

226.72 237.63 A: let's you know well i'm not seeing no ev- some of them are i don't see any evidence of weapons you know blah blah blah why did we go and and well you know it's not even been two months you know 

236.90 239.16 B: right right it hasn't 

238.17 245.06 A: and this man had you know twenty years to cover his [laughter] trail 

243.37 245.08 B: right right 

245.16 246.41 A: (( so to speak )) 

246.01 248.46 B: exactly he he has 

248.14 249.06 A: so 

249.26 254.30 A: yeah i think that it would be great if we found everything that we possibly could 

254.02 255.04 B: right 

255.06 263.20 B: and and you know gave those people a chance like i do agree with one thing that you know we need to give them a chance at democracy 

263.49 269.59 B: um some kind of uh you know system that they can work with because i can't imagine 

263.62 264.79 A: mhm 

270.03 273.06 B: you know how that must be to live in a country like that 

272.55 273.59 A: (( right yeah )) 

273.71 278.62 B: it really i mean when you think about it it comes down to just the luck of the draw 

278.38 279.34 A: mhm 

278.73 281.22 B: that we were born here instead of there 

280.73 281.92 A: that's right 

281.48 283.91 B: it's that tenuous you know 

283.08 291.80 A: yeah yeah yeah well it's just like your parents always said you know [laughter] there's children starving in africa thank god you were born here you know [laughter] 

288.13 289.75 B: exactly 

290.39 294.88 B: right i mean it just comes to down to to that random of a 

294.17 297.08 A: right and there's children you know all 

297.17 304.97 A: apparently in m- many countries that grow up under that threat of what if i get you know gassed today or whatever if 

303.54 306.55 B: right am i gonna come up missing tomorrow 

305.50 307.49 A: yeah yeah 

306.88 309.94 B: and still i guess they weren't getting fed ei- anyway 

309.35 310.46 A: right 

310.17 313.79 B: no medical uh they weren't distributing the medical uh 

311.02 311.99 A: right 

314.10 315.67 B: supplies or 

315.75 317.79 B: the aid that was getting through 

317.41 323.78 A: well and then people were looting that also i mean they were just attacking the trucks and distributing it 

320.48 321.60 B: mhm 

323.31 328.80 B: right right and i heard that some of the top officials in the government were selling it 

328.90 333.61 A: yeah right and that was happening in ethiopia also 

329.30 331.36 B: [laughter] 

333.13 336.23 B: oh yeah yeah yeah i heard that too 

333.93 335.64 A: same thing happened there 

336.11 337.05 A: so 

337.08 339.69 A: you know it's oh my gosh it's just 

340.07 344.61 B: it's funny how the greed of a couple of usually men [laughter] can 

343.32 351.84 A: yeah [laughter] always men girlfriend [laughter] you're talking to a he woman man hater [laughter] but yeah 

345.67 347.71 B: yes right right 

348.85 350.35 B: right 

350.36 354.79 B: i mean the the greed of a few men can bring so much destruction 

352.98 353.98 A: yeah 

354.31 356.49 A: yeah yeah 

355.53 357.39 B: it's just really sad 

357.79 361.60 B: and and hopefully they can have a chance for a different life 

362.61 369.01 B: [sigh] but they have gotten all the rest of the top guys so i mean that that does offer some hope 

368.43 376.20 A: yeah yeah like i say they're making progress every day and i think that people should just calm down and relax and 

375.82 377.33 B: give 'em a chance 

376.61 386.75 A: yeah give 'em a chance and even if they like i say even if they do not find weapons of mass destruction still in the country then they will find evidence of it i'm confident of that 

386.12 387.22 B: right 

387.36 388.36 A: so 

389.25 390.35 B: right 

390.07 400.53 A: because for nothing else we they need to prove to all these liberal skeptics that there w- you know there was a reason 

400.44 410.81 A: other than the fact that he was a mass murderer [laughter] to his own people there there was there was a threat to the world from him 

403.15 405.13 B: right right 

410.65 411.72 B: well 

410.84 419.82 A: and that's why we went in and that's i think that the last faction really should needs to have that proof you know 

412.66 413.77 B: right 

418.62 428.39 B: right right no matter what the outcome on that is the fact of the matter is they need to focus their attention on something else 'cause what they were doing ain't working 

428.21 429.12 A: right 

428.56 433.14 B: you know there's starving people there's people with no homes no medical care 

429.26 430.13 A: right 

431.60 432.82 A: (( right yeah yeah yeah yeah )) 

433.16 437.00 B: whatever they were doing whatever their focus was on it wasn't working 

437.35 440.64 B: so if we can at least redirect 'em into something else 

440.01 441.01 A: yeah 

440.93 441.96 B: (( you know )) 

442.62 448.35 B: 'cause it wasn't working at all for 'em you know like they say you can fish for 'em or teach 'em how to fish 

447.89 448.96 A: right 

448.69 453.05 B: so if we could just direct their attention to something a little more profitable for 'em 

452.33 453.51 A: mhm 

453.29 461.52 B: uh the the weapons of mass destruction thing wasn't working out [laughter] you know it doesn't take a genius to see that much 

461.00 462.16 A: (( right right )) 

461.99 466.91 B: so you know maybe they can focus on telling the people in simple terms hey 

467.44 470.89 B: w- whatever it wasn't working for you was it 

470.41 471.65 A: yeah 

471.54 476.13 B: and maybe that could also be a a tactic they could use 

475.43 476.69 A: yeah 

476.74 479.97 B: and just simple talk sometimes can 

480.79 484.35 B: accomplish quite a bit when you kinda put it in frank terms 

483.77 485.52 A: yeah 

485.50 499.89 A: yeah and it's like you know i was watching dennis miller his special on h._b._o. last night and he said hey you know we need to go uh kick a little butt every now and then he said has anybody heard from gaddafi lately you know [laughter] 

497.33 511.92 B: [laughter] right right oh no no now suddenly he's a leader on the u._n. security council [laughter] i thought about that too the other day when they said uh muammar gaddafi or da da da da i was like what since when 

502.42 505.10 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

505.16 506.06 A: so 

510.64 514.05 A: [laughter] yeah really [sigh] 

513.94 515.59 B: yeah that's true 

516.37 519.15 B: he uh he has become quite sedate 

518.78 524.32 A: yes and you know i'm sure that he's not getting any nuclear warheads put together 

523.80 525.50 B: no no 

524.42 526.02 A: because [mn] 

527.11 541.09 A: you know it it's just you can't have it you've gotta have and you've gotta let the people have the say of what they you know can do like you say democracy well if that's what they want you know 

541.59 543.43 A: or if they're gonna have it a 

543.61 552.78 A: something like the saudi arabias do a prince you know and all a royal family or whatever whatever they want but they have to 

547.17 549.29 B: right right if they 

551.64 557.01 B: if they've just gotta have a dictator [laughter] 

554.07 562.36 A: yeah [laughter] if you just gotta have a dictator go with the royal family business okay [laughter] because they probably won't be building nuclear 

558.14 564.88 B: right right right [laughter] [laughter] 

562.53 563.54 A: (( weapons )) 

563.88 568.87 A: [laughter] 'cause they're busy being their doing their royal family stuff [laughter] 

566.94 571.81 B: right right right you know what they say there is nobody hungry in saudi arabia 

572.18 575.01 A: yeah yeah they do say that yeah 

572.68 577.88 B: they say that yeah that country is the richest country in the world per capita 

577.76 586.02 A: yeah but i do but i don't trust them any more than i did saddam hussein i mean it's the as far as i'm they could have 

580.81 582.36 B: oh i don't either 

586.03 599.89 A: they could have weapons there of mass destruction but they're probably weapons [laughter] from saddam hussein you know like i say it uh i i do believe that they're there and they were moved and hopefully we will find uh tangible 

590.87 592.50 B: right right
