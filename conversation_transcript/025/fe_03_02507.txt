22.10 22.98 A: wow 

25.69 26.86 A: mhm 

26.53 27.63 B: um 

27.69 29.45 B: i don't particularly like them 

30.12 30.91 B: uh 

30.14 31.00 A: because

37.20 39.39 A: [laughter] 

39.63 41.24 A: i like survivor 

41.10 43.80 B: survivor why oh 

41.74 42.81 A: mhm 

43.11 44.24 A: um 

45.69 47.36 A: gosh i guess because 

48.18 50.08 A: seeing how people interact 

52.16 54.52 B: okay continue [laughter] 

53.72 56.05 A: i mean because it's in um 

56.54 60.67 A: well that that's the hard part because on one hand it's authentic 

60.71 63.56 A: but on the other hand it's not because the cameras are there 

60.87 62.75 B: (( yeah )) 

63.24 77.52 B: right and from what past things i've heard about shows especially survivor they have edited it and changed things just to increase the interest your interest level 

64.04 64.98 A: so 

73.00 73.87 A: right 

77.44 78.57 A: yeah 

77.97 80.52 B: so to me it's not truthful 

80.64 85.31 B: when you've got cameras that you can change things around edit um 

84.54 87.26 A: right so they can change a person 

87.30 89.07 B: right 

87.59 90.93 A: attitude or personality based on what they show 

90.46 91.77 B: to fit the show 

91.49 92.61 A: yeah 

91.98 94.86 B: and to me that's not reality television 

95.63 97.36 B: but to me um 

98.12 102.87 B: all these shows that come on um these reality type shows where people are coming in 

103.08 106.97 B: with divorces court cases and things like that 

104.42 105.31 A: mhm 

107.32 109.46 B: (( i don't believe in airing my business )) 

109.41 110.37 A: right 

110.14 111.66 B: like that um 

110.92 114.39 A: yeah that's the thing that i don't like about it and it seems like those people 

114.46 117.60 A: they do just want to get their fifteen minutes of fame or whatever 

117.00 122.87 B: right and if the people wanting to get rich quick all these people are producing these shows 

122.60 123.77 A: mhm 

123.16 124.09 B: um 

124.11 126.69 B: it's humiliating if you ask me 

126.29 127.17 A: right 

126.86 127.79 B: (( um )) 

128.30 139.94 B: i don't want you to know what i do with my husband that's that's in my my home my privacy my privacy has been invaded um and it also subjects the public to too much 

132.89 133.87 A: yeah 

134.98 135.81 A: right 

140.79 143.15 B: weird things going on out there 

143.08 146.54 A: well and plus all the shows now the bachelor and the 

146.76 150.30 A: marrying people and those are ridiculous 

150.43 152.63 B: are they just doing it for the money 

152.71 153.86 B: do you think 

153.60 155.38 A: the people that go on it 

154.78 155.67 B: yes 

155.98 158.72 A: yeah i think so either for the money or 

158.96 160.22 B: the the fame 

159.78 164.42 A: for the fame because they want to be an actor an actress and this is a good way to get in 

160.52 162.21 B: (( right )) 

164.25 165.60 B: and i think they 

165.78 168.01 B: tend to heighten 

168.05 169.85 B: the actual 

170.49 173.64 B: bumper trail of it even the participants 

173.63 174.63 A: mhm 

173.90 178.41 B: just so they can get more publicity um 

178.61 179.56 B: more 

179.93 187.91 B: uh more people calling 'em uh look at how as soon as someone's kicked off the survivor they're on the today show or whatever 

181.78 182.59 A: right 

187.38 188.83 A: yeah the next day 

188.45 192.54 B: i mean and you know there's money in- involved in this stuff 

192.49 193.36 A: right 

193.21 194.13 B: um 

194.16 198.36 B: one show i really did like and i i watched it for a little while 

198.39 203.30 B: it was um couples going from different countries 

203.65 205.38 B: to find clues 

204.30 205.91 A: oh the amazing race 

205.54 206.72 B: (( yes )) 

206.10 207.85 A: oh i love that show 

207.32 208.69 B: what happened to it 

208.34 209.93 A: i don't know 

210.12 213.41 A: you know i was thinking that just the other day and i was wondering 

213.51 217.28 A: because i always wondered like what if something happened 

218.03 223.57 A: i mean like something bad happened during the show what would they do 

220.12 221.88 B: bad happened right 

221.89 222.79 B: uh-huh 

223.45 227.16 B: right would they air that will they let you know that outcome 

226.00 232.86 A: right and that makes me wonder if it if we haven't seen it for a while because that did happen or 

232.45 233.40 B: right 

233.20 238.12 A: you know what i mean 'cause that show was good and it got i thought it did really well 

236.57 244.30 B: [mn] it got very it very it got very good as it went on i was always rooting for the older couple because they were leading 

240.13 241.16 A: mhm 

244.04 245.19 A: yeah 

244.37 248.79 B: and boom not to not to win that just really shocked me 

248.19 249.24 A: yeah 

249.48 253.01 B: i mean they were so and they used their intelligence 

252.84 253.69 A: right 

253.19 255.72 B: they worked together so well 

255.73 259.99 B: and then the young couple that won just out of pure luck 

259.89 261.09 A: mhm 

261.01 262.44 B: i couldn't believe it 

262.34 263.63 A: [laughter] 

263.95 265.11 B: dumb luck 

265.22 266.90 B: in in a way it 

266.33 267.32 A: yeah 

267.06 269.31 B: got them them to be the winners 

269.36 270.38 A: yeah 

269.53 273.13 B: um but a lot of this reality goes overboard 

272.79 276.62 A: it does and you know the other thing that i think about even though i do like it 

276.77 278.24 A: i feel like it's 

278.42 280.29 A: corrupting our values 

279.69 280.62 B: thank you 

280.41 281.81 A: in many ways 

281.36 283.94 B: but what is it teaching our young children 

283.36 284.62 A: exactly 

284.24 286.33 B: you can do anything for money 

286.04 286.98 A: right 

286.34 287.74 B: that's what's it teaching 

287.74 294.85 A: well and especially like on m._t._v. they have real world and road rules and fraternity life and sorority life and 

294.43 295.11 B: (( them )) 

295.26 297.78 A: you know all those things that show young people 

298.29 300.39 A: really not having any values 

300.20 306.18 B: [sigh] did you um i i know on that survivor thing it was something about the rats 

303.73 304.65 A: mhm 

306.62 308.43 B: do you remember that episode 

308.17 309.53 A: about a rat 

309.13 311.95 B: some rats they did something with rats 

312.76 314.08 A: oh i don't know 

313.71 323.40 B: um on survivor and then um spiders crawled on their face or something like that and just just things that you would think are so horrible 

322.95 324.00 A: right 

324.44 329.03 B: but if a child sees this they're going to subject themselves to it just as 

329.11 332.42 B: to test it out to to see the danger 

330.19 331.04 A: right 

331.93 333.47 A: to see what'll happen 

333.10 335.16 B: and in turn 

335.85 341.31 B: that's gone to to me i would bring a lawsuit against a company quickly on something like that 

340.70 341.72 A: yeah 

341.37 345.72 B: because it was not screened and researched properly 

345.84 354.42 B: it was just brought on television sure you do say some of this stuff is uh like uh the maturity of the material might not suit everyone 

354.11 355.46 A: mhm 

354.83 356.73 B: that's not enough of a warning 

356.75 360.02 A: yeah exactly well because plus i mean 

360.21 365.09 A: so many kids now you know have t._v.s in their rooms or they aren't monitored 

363.13 364.58 B: mhm 

364.77 366.52 B: (( i know i know )) 

365.50 369.61 A: and so who knows what they're watching you know and that's scary 

366.96 368.37 B: what they're watching 

369.31 375.01 B: when i was growing up you couldn't even hear a curse word on television they would say darn 

374.91 375.85 A: yeah 

375.10 376.71 B: and kind of beep it 

376.88 377.75 A: right 

377.19 378.93 B: and now you hear everything 

378.59 379.90 A: i know 

379.75 383.15 B: but it it's scary i some of the words i don't even know 

382.84 384.49 A: [laughter] 

384.84 389.97 B: well i'm a black american right and when i grew up i grew up in the sixties 

386.91 387.84 A: uh-huh 

390.07 397.43 B: and my parents i i i remember things like this always bothered me um they were elderly when they had us 

397.18 398.08 A: mhm 

397.45 404.48 B: um and they my father was and mother were born in nineteen seventeen so they always considered themselves colored 

404.79 409.85 B: and that's the block they would always check on an application and things like that 

409.89 414.75 B: and that's how they referred to themselves and then we went to black americans 

414.83 415.80 A: right 

415.23 416.21 B: and i 

416.27 423.86 B: i agreed with that for a while and now they put on there afro americans we tend not to check any block 

420.04 421.51 A: (( african american )) 

423.82 425.21 A: oh really 

424.57 431.09 B: yeah because we don't want to be defined by a a race we wanted to be defined as a person 

427.07 428.19 A: right 

428.85 429.76 A: yeah 

430.62 432.28 A: as a person yeah 

431.65 439.55 B: and that's how we should all be i don't care what color you are you know we we bleed the same we cry the same 

433.51 434.42 A: i know 

435.80 437.01 A: exactly 

437.74 438.71 A: yeah 

440.06 449.83 B: so i i think these reality televisions have pushed us to the point where we want to see the strange the weird the most impossible out there 

449.47 450.58 A: right 

449.91 454.59 B: and [noise] so we've now segregated ourselves in a way in reality again 

454.52 455.51 A: yeah 

455.36 461.04 B: because now the young black especially young black guys call themselves nigger 

461.74 463.05 A: yeah 

463.16 465.30 B: and that is so disgraceful to me 

464.95 465.97 A: right 

465.51 468.30 B: i i feel like we've we've stepped back 

468.31 469.74 B: a hundred years 

470.06 471.34 A: yeah i agree 

470.88 476.65 B: to to to call ourselves something like that i you know you just want to say the klan is back 

476.67 477.87 A: mhm 

477.68 483.22 B: (( if you [noise] want to say something like that [noise] how how do you feel on topics like that )) 

483.11 488.89 A: well i mean speaking in that respect it was interesting for me i was in maryland because i was in the air force 

484.77 486.87 B: [noise] 

488.60 489.51 B: uh-huh 

489.36 496.26 A: and when i moved back here it's because i have family i'm in st louis and i have family in st louis and kansas city 

495.87 496.75 B: uh-huh 

496.42 498.88 A: but i found a job in st louis so i came here 

498.47 499.64 B: (( mhm )) 

498.95 502.11 A: st louis is very racially segregated 

501.52 503.09 B: oh okay 

502.27 503.74 A: (( it's surprising )) 

503.47 504.32 B: uh-huh 

503.91 507.16 A: and plus me coming from the military which is 

506.36 508.00 B: [noise] 

507.44 513.97 A: you know not segregated at all at all i mean you're a person you do your job you know it's how [laughter] it should be in my opinion 

509.15 510.06 B: uh-huh 

513.73 514.59 B: uh-huh 

514.60 515.85 A: and um 

516.94 519.41 A: it it was it's really weird 

519.00 520.12 B: i know 

519.91 520.85 A: you know 

520.34 526.79 B: we're retired military and we actually love it because there was no 

522.27 523.44 A: oh really 

524.03 525.10 A: yeah 

527.07 528.06 B: i mean 

528.88 540.28 B: race never made played a part in anything we ever did you're welcome sweetheart um i just love it and i hate that we're retired because i feel like we're segregated ag- again now 

531.97 533.57 A: exactly 

539.63 540.51 A: right 

540.44 544.13 B: e- everything's so different some the way the military have us going 

543.85 544.91 A: i know 

544.95 546.28 B: how long were you in 

546.21 548.02 A: i was in for five years 

547.44 550.40 B: oh i did seven my husband did twenty two 

550.14 551.36 A: oh wow 

550.63 556.80 B: yeah we really enjoyed it [noise] we we just really really enjoyed it it was wonderful 

554.84 556.01 A: yeah 

557.07 560.58 B: [noise] and so so did you are you home now

573.18 574.06 B: uh-huh 

573.85 577.90 A: and so i always had that struggle when i had to mark his race 

577.98 579.35 A: i mark them both 

578.99 580.64 B: (( see see )) 

579.68 588.57 A: you know he's both [laughter] and i don't want to you know have him because to me that's him choosing one and he's not going to choose one he's who he is 

580.77 581.39 B: (( uh-huh )) 

588.27 591.71 B: but you know what they legally say about that
