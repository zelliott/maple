73.82 77.81 B: and and do you like it because is it because ah 

77.82 82.38 B: is it it's live it's not edited maybe that's the reason 

82.27 82.83 A: (( [noise] )) 

82.85 84.84 A: maybe i think so 

84.51 85.49 B: okay 

84.83 98.50 A: [noise] i know that i don't like it if if i don't get to know the characters like right now if i were to flip on survivor 'cause i haven't watched it all season if i were to you know watch an episode i wouldn't like it because i haven't seen it all season 'cause you don't know the characters you know what i mean 

90.53 91.47 B: uh-huh 

94.07 95.23 B: same as me

109.52 110.93 A: you're bored now with it 

110.51 122.10 B: yeah so i [laughter] i usually well now that it's the sports season i've heard the baseball has started and you have n._b._a. games happening i s- 

120.55 122.72 A: uh-huh you'd rather watch that 

122.08 127.47 B: ah yeah i get more i think that's more reality show than the reality shows like who 

126.75 131.48 A: well yeah yeah i see how you can think that i guess my husband probably feels that way too 

131.10 137.49 B: i think it happens in every family the wife wants to watch maybe a show or a serial or 

137.53 139.77 B: an episode and then m- [laughter] 

140.02 143.32 B: the guy wants to watch n._b._a. or baseball or 

142.93 148.19 A: yeah that's probably true i think the women are probably a little more into than the men although my husband 

146.58 147.47 B: okay 

148.25 152.86 A: sometimes i think he says he doesn't like it but i think there are times when 

150.59 151.34 B: (( mm )) 

153.03 156.36 A: you know even though you might not like it you just can't tear yourself away 

155.96 158.88 B: yeah that's true sometimes you have to give up yeah 

158.65 159.70 A: yeah 

159.24 163.93 B: yeah you have to just maybe give up something for to get something else yeah that's true 

165.02 167.78 B: okay so that's true 

166.12 166.76 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

167.73 169.33 A: have you ever seen big brother 

169.57 170.93 B: big brother 

170.36 171.26 A: mhm 

170.94 173.20 B: ah not yet do you see it 

173.52 176.69 A: well it's um i've seen it the last two summers that it was on 

176.48 177.87 B: okay so 

176.93 179.69 A: and so you know it'll probably be on again this summer 

179.27 180.24 B: okay 

180.20 181.44 A: it's really 

182.16 185.72 A: not very good but i have to say i watch it [laughter] 

184.33 187.41 B: oh okay that's true that's true 

187.97 191.21 B: (( [noise] so this is this the first time you are participating in this study )) 

190.80 191.77 A: i'm sorry 

191.46 193.57 B: (( is this the first time you're calling in )) 

192.66 194.60 A: um i've done one other call 

194.52 199.20 B: okay actually i also have done yesterday one so this is my second call 

198.59 199.87 A: yeah me too 

199.83 204.30 B: yeah yesterday there was something on what's a very bad personal habit 

204.34 206.04 B: did you get the same topic oh 

204.72 207.32 A: yeah yeah i did 

206.42 208.97 B: okay so that's what they've been so 

209.79 214.48 A: i was kind of worried that the topics would be something that i didn't know anything about but hey i know about reality t._v. 

214.02 217.58 B: yeah reality t._v.'s something which we keep [laughter] 

217.59 220.13 B: (( seeing all the time it's ah not some )) 

219.33 226.35 A: do you think it's gonna go away i keep hearing people say that it's gonna it's on its way out and people aren't gonna watch it any more after a while what do you think 

225.96 236.54 B: um i think ah it won't go away but the format of that will change for example now you want now you have bachelor and things but in the future it might be something else 

237.12 240.54 A: well that's true they keep coming up with all different kinds of ideas 

239.11 252.35 B: yeah so it will it will come in a different a different flavor that's it ah people are going to watch maybe something like who wants to become a billionaire then [laughter] instead of instead of a millionaire that time million won't have any value so 

247.82 249.72 A: yeah really 

252.20 253.31 A: right 

252.26 254.15 B: we'll have a billionaire thing 

254.03 255.38 A: [laughter] 

254.40 261.37 B: and also i think these shows will become more prominent because people have more time to spend nowadays 

261.93 264.12 A: you think so you think people have more time 

264.40 275.16 B: (( ah at least because technology has progressed you have a lot of things happening um um but as you said ah people have a lot of time but they also have a lot of other things to do )) 

275.17 276.07 A: uh-huh 

275.42 278.18 B: they have a lot of things to do in their lives so that's true 

279.20 282.05 B: um maybe hm i 

279.31 281.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

281.18 284.51 A: (( you know i i think that sitcoms do you like sitcoms )) 

284.36 286.94 B: yes i watch some of them yeah 

286.50 290.27 A: see i don't i don't like 'em [mn] i can't think of any that i really like except maybe friends 

290.20 292.48 B: friends i like friends yeah 

292.10 301.71 A: and and i think that in my opinion because they're not very good any more it's it's just hard to find any of them that are funny in my opinion and that's maybe why people watch reality t._v. 

300.11 301.52 B: (( do you watch seinfeld )) 

302.59 306.72 A: seinfeld i yeah i mean i like that yeah i used to watch that when it was on 

306.13 314.04 B: yeah it's like again ah ah i live on the east coast so i don't have much time to actually spend because i come really late to my home 

314.25 315.22 A: you what 

314.88 316.89 B: (( i live in the east coast )) 

316.64 317.97 A: oh okay uh-huh 

317.36 319.87 B: (( so i'm i'm hardly in at )) 

318.94 320.70 A: oh so you can really relate okay 

320.32 322.19 B: (( ah really relate ah )) 

322.66 323.64 A: i'm sorry 

323.28 332.04 B: i live in the big apple so i don't have much time to spend because i have to commute for maybe more than an hour every day i come back really late 

331.51 335.13 A: uh-huh oh wow really you have to commute wow 

332.07 333.26 B: i don't have much 

334.65 342.80 B: yeah so i live in the so new york city's so huge so to move from one side of the city to the other side it takes a lot of time so 

338.42 339.34 A: uh-huh 

343.35 345.25 A: yeah that's well yeah 

345.10 345.93 B: yeah 

345.26 347.24 A: that would cut into your t._v. time 

347.53 349.80 B: yes definitely 

349.60 355.15 A: so is that just i mean i guess that's just the way of life for you there you're just used to it 

352.76 356.57 B: yeah it's w- yeah the life here is really hectic 

358.79 359.52 A: (( hm )) 

358.84 359.40 B: (( [mn] )) 

359.44 360.41 B: (( it happens )) 

359.74 363.80 A: is it ah more than an hour commute one way or just both ways 

363.42 364.84 B: (( both ways yeah )) 

364.16 366.55 A: both ways okay well that's not that bad i guess 

366.43 367.20 B: (( huh )) 

366.56 370.14 A: [noise] right i mean that's so it's over two hours commute total 

369.90 371.92 B: (( ah two and a half hours actually )) 

372.50 373.47 A: two and a half 

373.08 374.08 B: yes 

374.17 376.89 A: wow that's not that bad really 

375.02 376.38 B: so that's a lot of time 

376.47 378.19 B: that's a lot of time 

378.08 379.45 A: it is a lot of time 

379.11 383.05 B: and there are people who travel for four hours a day so i'm much better oh 

382.17 385.12 A: (( gosh that is unbelievable )) 

385.09 390.22 B: yeah people actually some people travel from philadelphia to new york city every day 

385.52 386.54 A: [noise] 

391.99 398.76 B: so that they actually travel through new jersey to come to new york city so it takes two hours each way for them 

392.08 393.16 A: wow 

399.00 401.98 A: that is unbelievable who has that kind of time 

400.18 401.08 B: yeah 

401.79 406.65 B: ha i don't there are people who actually does it because they like the lifestyle in philly 

407.39 411.48 B: so because they have good apartments the education system is good 

410.93 411.80 A: uh-huh 

411.49 417.15 B: so they what they do is they don't mind commuting over time for three or four hours a day 

417.46 418.33 A: (( wow ))

450.64 451.86 A: no it's not good 

451.60 452.54 B: (( oh okay )) 

451.89 452.81 A: (( it's dumb )) 

452.64 456.69 B: so what's the serial you recommend to me maybe a sitcom or a reality 

455.57 463.33 A: what would i recommend i would i would recommend the bachelor but now you're kind of getting in on the end of it i would recommend the bachelorette next time it comes out 

462.95 463.87 B: uh-huh 

463.55 465.18 A: you should watch it from the beginning 

464.85 467.54 B: yeah it's a good thing to watch right 

466.85 468.86 A: (( well it's it's entertaining )) 

468.57 469.54 B: okay 

469.60 470.63 A: (( um )) 

471.33 474.72 A: and i think that you should watch what else do i watch 

475.97 478.74 A: i guess have you ever seen a whole series of survivor 

478.93 486.67 B: not ah not completely i i watched i have watched it but ah usually in bits and pieces i miss a couple of episodes and then watch again 

479.31 480.93 A: like the whole season i mean 

485.22 489.71 A: see if you if you don't watch it from beginning to end it's it's not good 

489.52 490.62 B: oh i 

489.74 492.95 A: you gotta start from the very beginning and you gotta watch all the episodes 

492.72 494.61 B: okay then i'll really get the flow 

494.78 498.26 A: yes then you'll really get it yeah o- otherwise it's not 

496.36 497.43 B: okay 

498.62 500.69 A: it's just not as good at all 

500.37 501.87 B: okay okay 

500.98 503.59 A: that's the secret to reality t._v. in my opinion 

502.88 509.07 B: ha okay so the secret to reality t._v. is to get the context in full you have to watch it completely 

509.35 512.60 A: completely from the beginning from the first episode 

510.90 511.68 B: (( mm )) 

512.22 513.37 B: mhm 

512.88 515.38 A: to the end 'cause if you miss the first episode 

515.04 515.80 B: (( mm )) 

515.52 517.50 A: i think you're probably 

517.66 521.69 A: gonna have less of a chance at to be interested in it part season you know 

519.89 520.88 B: okay 

520.91 525.73 B: okay okay i got it maybe all that you should watch the replay or something 

522.47 523.92 A: (( so that's like )) 

525.73 529.74 A: yeah watch the replay if they show it sometimes they will show 

527.08 527.91 B: yeah 

529.63 530.60 B: okay 

530.13 532.29 A: them over again that week so 

532.01 536.28 B: or maybe sometimes they'll something over the web t._v. you can watch it over the computer 

536.36 540.05 A: oh really okay well then yeah 

537.89 540.87 B: in new york city that happens a lot of times 

540.64 541.64 A: really 

541.29 544.17 B: and also there are people there is a website here 

544.33 547.43 B: so in case if you miss an particular episode 

547.85 553.18 B: they you actually you actually can put in a request for someone who has actually recorded that program 

553.13 554.40 A: oh that's neat 

554.13 558.69 B: so you can just go get it from them watch it maybe pay them a couple of bucks that kind of thing 

557.76 560.93 A: yeah well that's definitely what you would have to do to stay 

560.99 562.50 A: interested in 

561.95 563.72 B: (( oh yeah that's good )) 

564.29 565.80 B: i think [mn] 

566.71 569.54 B: (( all things about reality t._v. i think )) 

566.83 567.74 A: (( it okay )) 

569.22 570.29 A: you think what 

570.43 574.95 B: (( i was i was thinking about something about reality t._v. something which we can talk about so )) 

576.06 578.44 B: (( seems to me that we have run out of ideas now )) 

579.71 581.65 A: (( yeah i like that topic )) 

581.79 583.37 B: yeah 

583.56 584.18 B: (( okay )) 

584.34 585.35 A: are they gonna 

585.52 587.29 A: i hope they don't play these tapes 

587.88 588.81 B: (( ha )) 

588.04 591.81 A: on t._v. or something [laughter] [noise] i sure would feel stupid 

589.18 590.80 B: [laughter] do you think so 

591.75 596.69 B: yeah i i i think they can't do it right you haven't given your consent to do do that 

591.88 592.63 A: (( [laughter] )) 

597.81 599.64 A: right i wouldn't think that they would 

598.88 599.89 B: i hope they're
