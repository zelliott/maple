36.73 37.77 B: yes 

38.45 41.80 A: no i don't think it's any of our business [laughter] to be in iraq

58.11 59.18 B: right 

60.99 62.30 B: (( right [noise] )) 

61.87 65.50 A: like the uninvited mother in law or something like that is

66.55 67.69 A: that what you think 

66.65 67.36 B: that's 

67.53 81.66 B: yeah that is pretty true um i've spent a lot of time overseas like even before this long before september eleven and a lot of the reaction to people that i worked with really is just very negative about americans even going back then and this is from our allies you know 

81.44 87.73 B: just because they think we're too cocky and too confident and you know going into places where we have no business and stuff like that 

87.83 101.36 B: so i mean i i kind of really fear for our opinion on the world stage at this point because i think that you know people are gonna be gunning to get us at the same time the whole iraq thing just makes me really uncomfortable because 

97.13 98.05 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

101.29 110.28 B: we went in there when we shouldn't have we granted we did kick out saddam hussein which was good but we could have done that ten years ago we've known about him for a long [laughter] time 

110.08 112.26 A: yeah and and i 

112.42 115.84 A: going on two years later where's osama

117.98 119.12 B: right 

118.25 123.96 A: but you're gonna just go bomb you know a lot of people died a lot of people died 

123.03 125.17 B: i i know i know 

124.29 132.68 A: they're not showing us that and a lot of people died and whoopee we got saddam we actually we don't where is he 

132.34 133.43 B: right 

133.58 137.54 A: you know he's probably took off um 

136.59 137.63 B: right 

138.03 148.25 A: i don't know if he took off just before or or right before they got there or a long time before and was controlling from an offsite location but 

148.09 148.80 B: (( [sigh] mm )) 

148.67 149.75 A: i 

150.47 152.80 A: i don't trust the 

153.97 158.10 A: the secret service um you know who intelligence 

155.12 156.02 B: no 

157.76 158.66 B: no 

158.47 164.01 A: i don't know what intelligence means but it's not know where people are when they are where 

163.66 177.69 B: yeah i i know there's a lot of stuff that they keep from us and i they say it's in the you know the interests of national security and stuff like that but at the same time it kind of gives them a license to just do whatever the hell they want you know and i don't necessarily agree with that either 

177.48 182.82 A: which is unfortunately what's happening locally um locally you know in our own nation 

182.55 183.53 B: mhm 

183.24 186.07 A: we're giving up a lot of civil rights

191.06 192.10 B: mhm 

195.36 206.76 B: right i know and it's like if you're on the internet or something and people can read your email and it's like well you know it's the freedom of information act blah blah blah and it's like well no it's not i have a right to privacy [laughter] 

196.43 197.26 A: (( [noise] ))

226.64 237.99 B: yeah i know that's true i'm worried too about the whole restructuring structuring of iraq after this 'cause i think it's gonna be a huge huge huge financial burden for our country that we just can't even afford right now 

228.90 229.70 A: (( you know )) 

238.17 245.95 A: yeah um i don't know what type of work you do but i've seen a serious slowdown in in the industry where i work i work in construction

276.44 288.31 B: right no it's true it's true 'cause i work in retail and it's you know it's the same thing i'm on commission sales and i'm not making any money because people just aren't shopping you know [laughter] nobody wants to buy anything you

297.10 298.64 A: like i'm accustomed to 

298.37 303.91 B: right 'cause you don't know when it's gonna be coming in again well that's at least the feeling i have you're not earning and it's kinda like 

302.88 305.49 A: right you don't know you don't know what's coming up in 

305.48 306.67 B: yeah 

306.07 307.60 A: a year from now

308.50 309.27 B: so 

310.27 314.62 A: i was looking at at apartments and and there's just all kinds of different 

314.66 315.48 A: um 

315.70 317.78 A: different areas that have been affected 

317.46 318.48 B: mhm 

318.24 322.24 A: so i don't know if it's still because of the iraq thing 

322.25 323.22 B: mhm 

322.62 323.59 A: (( um )) 

324.21 330.12 A: i i'm not sure what you know what all is that brings it into the mix that's causing such a slowdown 

330.19 344.85 B: i yeah i don't know i mean because economists predicted like a slowdown before september eleventh even hit and i don't know if that you know really catalyzed things and just kind of drove everything to a halt or what but it's it's really weird i mean i don't know i hope it picks up 

343.87 347.65 A: yeah the market was the market was already on a on a down 

347.96 349.74 A: down curve you know 

349.34 350.54 B: (( mhm )) 

349.93 350.91 A: (( um )) 

351.35 352.94 A: but it just seems 

353.78 354.65 A: (( i don't know )) 

354.66 355.64 B: yeah 

354.97 356.26 A: i don't know if the 

357.18 364.74 A: i don't think that like going into iraq i don't think we should have been so quick to go 

364.52 368.01 B: oh no absolutely not i mean we didn't exhaust 

365.88 369.47 A: um the inspections and all of that stuff 

369.06 370.14 B: (( mhm )) 

370.02 379.62 A: i don't know at see why are we inspecting iraq looking for something we can't find and china's going hello yes we're working on nuclear weapons 

378.75 382.00 B: [laughter] it's true it's true 

381.16 391.71 A: it's like excuse me there's a serious danger like right here it's true it's present it exists they're aware of it they're telling us yeah we got 'em so what 

385.29 386.22 B: i know 

388.32 389.41 B: i know 

391.39 392.86 B: (( yeah that's )) 

392.03 399.12 A: and we're going well wait a minute we can't spend any time on you right now 'cause we gotta go to iraq and look for the shit we can't find 

398.52 410.77 B: well the thing is it was more of a personal vendetta with george bush than it was like anything else there wasn't a lot of dip- like that's my opinion at least it seems like he wanted to go in to prove to his father that he can do it you know and it's just like 

403.50 404.40 A: oh 

408.55 409.90 A: i know 

409.94 412.07 A: jay leno had a ball with that

413.81 414.88 B: i can remem- 

414.74 421.75 A: father's day he was doing i don't know if i should buy my dad a tie rack or attack iraq 

415.90 416.72 B: (( uh-huh )) 

421.17 424.07 B: [laughter] it's true though 

422.93 432.42 A: tie rack attack iraq tie rack attack iraq i think i'll attack iraq [laughter] and it was like oh my god don't do this based on a you know on a personal 

427.52 428.57 B: yeah 

432.14 433.16 B: right 

432.35 439.84 A: vendetta like you said you know don't don't go out there just to make daddy happy 'cause he didn't finish the job he should have done ten years ago 

439.43 446.79 B: right yeah i yeah i don't the whole thing is just so wrong on so many levels it's it's frightening 

445.36 446.43 A: mhm 

447.26 451.90 B: but yeah i'm really worried too that if um we go in there and try to restructure 

451.71 462.62 B: iraq like we did with japan it's gonna turn into one of those situations where like we're like okay you cannot have a military but we'll pay for all of your defense and we'll pay for all of your this and we'll pay for all of your that 

461.89 464.11 A: yeah and where's that money coming from 

463.46 466.33 B: exactly [laughter] you know and 

464.35 465.33 A: [laughter] 

465.42 474.59 A: it's like bush is saying i'm gonna drop taxes for you american citizens how do you drop taxes and spend a whole lot of money

482.43 484.07 B: i know i know 

483.25 485.79 A: it was it was not cheap you know and 

484.84 497.64 B: and we've already just you know um relieved the debts of a couple of poor countries and so they don't have to pay us back which i mean i understand that but we still need that money too [laughter] you know it's all fair and good but
