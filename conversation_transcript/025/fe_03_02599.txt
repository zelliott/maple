285.05 291.18 B: well do you think that we should go to every country that has dictators like that and overthrow them 

291.62 295.04 A: no that is what we have the u._n. for 

295.29 299.55 A: now saddam was given twelve years seventeen eighteen

359.48 360.62 B: mhm 

359.99 367.10 A: as long as he was still in power nor do i think we'll ever be completely safe until we also
