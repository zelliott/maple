73.23 77.57 B: mean yeah he's a [noise] he's a bastard but is it is it worth

82.49 87.77 B: [noise] i don't think so he was [noise] he was no immediate danger i mean i 

88.37 97.01 A: you know i it seems to me that it was more like revenge for for the f- it was more like he wanted to finish his father's unfinished business 

98.62 107.09 B: [noise] i'll go even further than that i think that [noise] i i think that this has been the entitlement presidency [noise]

110.12 119.41 B: daddy got to be president i should be able to be president [noise] daddy had a war in iraq i should be able to have a war in iraq 

121.47 129.22 A: well i don't i don't like the secretive nature of the whole thing you know i mean i mean in the past even in during world war two 

129.36 133.98 A: there was some secrets but for the most part we we worked within an open system 

134.06 135.41 A: i mean we 

134.38 136.26 B: [noise] also we were fighting hitler 

136.57 146.67 A: [mn] yeah but we were also working in an open system and here you know it's people can be arrested without ch- being charged you know th- they're not willing to share information 

146.81 148.64 A: you know that's 

148.05 152.27 B: [noise] w- well there i actually disagree with you i don't know how open a system we were 

152.94 155.40 B: [noise] if not disagree 

155.46 169.61 B: if not disagree at least at least question are you sure that having an open system [noise] was was a priority back then i mean [noise] it's almost but just a just automatically more than it is now but are you sure that it was 

165.59 167.02 A: well that well that 

169.71 175.86 B: that was really a priority then [noise] 

171.76 185.06 A: well it was it was much more open [noise] the deal was that back then [noise] if there still was a reason to keep something secret like a particular attack that was kept secret but in terms of the general 

184.03 185.22 B: pearl harbor 

185.10 193.18 A: in terms of the general debate the debate was was was kept open you know i mean and and 

191.49 193.47 B: unless you were japanese 

193.69 198.59 A: well but right the japanese internment system 

194.98 196.21 B: or black 

196.79 198.62 B: (( [noise] )) 

198.68 203.22 A: was uh [laughter] was was a great scourge of the time 

198.93 199.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

201.94 202.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

203.18 206.47 B: yeah 

203.28 205.23 A: um and uh 

205.40 212.00 A: i and i i don't know anything about [cough] the black core that you know i mean the the core that went in separately 

212.03 214.78 B: (( well i don't think we're )) 

212.07 215.61 A: [noise] i i think that i guess that was sort of kept secret too 

215.30 217.90 B: supposed to get too off topic 

217.46 220.47 A: yeah well yeah we're back to iraq back 

218.86 219.66 B: they 

219.67 225.13 B: they won't they won't pay us if it's too off topic all right 

222.48 226.85 A: to yeah we drifted off off iraq unfortunately but in the 

225.91 227.81 B: that's okay we've got a few minutes 

227.93 229.40 A: we've got two minutes 

229.30 238.71 B: yeah [noise] have you noticed how the objective of the war keeps changing 

239.56 249.25 A: yes i've noti- i mean that's that's my point is as soon as you prove the objective is false he changes the objective [mn] or changes the state of reason for going to the war 

253.13 256.16 B: [noise] the reason why that is 

256.27 260.54 B: as long as you keep your motive really fluid then 

261.46 267.49 B: then you can't be held accountable for whether or not not you succeeded at it 

270.26 273.95 A: well it makes it it makes it it makes him a moving target 

274.44 276.41 A: rather than a stationary target 

276.98 278.90 A: in terms of debate 

279.90 282.61 B: [noise] [noise] uh i read that after 

283.33 284.83 B: after the uh 

285.95 291.99 B: [noise] after they toppled the statue and everything 

290.63 291.61 A: uh-huh

295.38 300.79 B: (( are we [mn] not [noise] )) 

302.41 308.68 B: at what at what point will we have considered this a victory and [noise] 

308.95 314.24 B: and he j- he just uh kept saying over and over

317.89 321.43 B: what what constitutes a victory later on 

322.25 327.21 B: [noise] you see w- what he's doing there he's b- he's basically saying basically saying we'll 

327.07 338.13 B: we'll wait and see what happens and then we'll say that that our that it was our plan all along to cause that to happen and we'll take the credit for it 

334.85 338.27 A: [laughter] you're right 

338.02 343.63 B: [noise] 

338.58 339.82 A: (( i mean it's so )) 

339.81 353.93 A: there's there's such i mean it's the worst administration we've ever had and they're blatantly bad i mean that's the whole thing it's it's scary that i mean they're kind of they've kind of been given a free hand i mean we're not people aren't 

344.26 345.19 B: yes 

354.21 359.78 A: putting them you know aren't criticizing them the way they should the press has been fairly lax about it

360.21 361.14 A: you know 

363.88 365.53 B: [noise] [noise] he doesn't

374.15 375.17 B: [noise] 

374.71 378.19 A: i didn't hear everything you said you're fading in and out 

378.03 383.84 B: you remember about the hotel where all the western press were saying got shot by a tank 

382.79 385.20 A: yeah accidentally [laughter] 

385.24 391.77 B: and there's documented proof that no one was firing at the tank at the time that they they fired that shot off 

391.57 393.26 A: yeah i heard that too 

392.24 396.44 B: it it wasn't in in retribution for anything 

397.86 406.71 A: well you know it was it was more i think it was more probably to bring home the point that iraq's a dangerous place you know and [mn] 

408.86 409.83 B: [noise] 

410.40 413.65 B: [noise] place too [noise] 

415.51 417.29 A: i can't hear you very well 

418.42 422.91 B: so that if you go for he wants you to report [noise] 

423.04 424.20 B: [noise] 

430.00 431.82 A: i can't hear you very well 

432.83 433.60 B: (( huh )) 

435.09 436.54 B: anyway back to 

437.45 440.30 B: (( to iraq itself )) 

441.42 444.40 B: [noise] you realise all the things that they lost 

446.67 448.24 B: (( af- after )) 

448.79 449.51 B: (( the )) 

449.82 453.43 B: night that that the u._s. rolled in the 

453.71 455.47 B: all the ministries 

457.04 465.51 B: [noise] looters burned and destroyed the ministry of education the ministry of planning [noise] the ministry of irrigation [noise] 

461.89 463.31 A: museums 

463.32 467.01 A: and the museum yeah all the looters at the museum 

467.96 470.89 B: [noise] got the ministry of oil and the ministry of 

470.92 475.05 B: of intelligence in the interior 

473.59 476.57 A: well those were our priorities we had to preserve those 

475.34 478.89 B: [noise] yeah exactly we had troops stationed at those 

480.80 490.68 B: [noise] so yeah i mean supposedly this was to help the iraqi people don't you think the iraqi people could maybe use all those things 

492.20 499.24 A: yeah well i don't i see i'm v- i don't think they're the- i don't think that that's our real reason for being there to help the iraqi people 

500.19 501.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] huh no )) 

502.07 503.07 B: no 

503.11 515.25 B: yet another thing that a lot of people are just [noise] just don't even seem to care about is that [noise] that saddam would never have anything to do with bin laden they hate each other 

516.06 528.84 A: yeah well that's the that was well yeah nine eleven and and saddam hussein have nothing to do with each other they're totally unrelated but yet they're always talked about together as if somehow this is going to help 

521.18 524.16 B: [noise] that is 

524.59 527.62 B: [noise] 

528.71 530.07 B: [noise] 

529.42 532.04 A: you know what happened before 

532.32 538.52 B: [noise] 

532.40 534.65 A: i also find it kinda strange that 

534.72 539.58 A: bin laden wound up missing after the end of the afghanistan war and now 

540.06 541.80 A: [mn] saddam hussein is missing 

541.98 550.00 A: i mean i i think it just gives you a way that you can allow the war to continue for ever you know that you're never sure when they might pop up again you know if 

550.08 553.27 A: we were able to get rid of them then there would be no bogeyman any more 

555.16 560.27 B: [noise] [noise] well i don't know i mean always manage to find a new bogeyman 

560.92 563.91 B: there'll be a new one now maybe it'll be syria [noise] 

565.07 566.47 A: iran 

566.42 567.18 B: (( [noise] )) 

568.46 571.14 B: or north korea which even i could admit 

571.72 573.18 B: is fraught with is 

573.38 574.85 B: a threat 

575.42 578.82 A: yeah well it it yeah it it's 

579.42 584.29 A: well the thing is is that we're well we've been letting that brew for a while 

580.69 581.37 B: [noise] 

585.73 587.33 B: yeah we were too busy 

585.81 593.41 A: it seems to me it seems to me there there we had a diplomatic opportunity to deal with them and we chose to ignore the opportunity 

593.97 599.95 B: (( [noise] mm i ))
