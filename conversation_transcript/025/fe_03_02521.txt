42.96 43.97 B: uh-huh 

44.15 53.63 B: well i haven't watched i watched the first episode of joe millionaire and i thought it was incredibly stupid and i thought he seemed like a moron 

50.85 52.25 A: mhm 

53.03 54.16 A: mhm 

53.72 56.30 B: and i thought the girls were gold diggers

56.44 60.03 B: and i tried to watch um 

60.23 70.41 B: the i'm a celebrity get me out of here but only because i thought for some reason that steve martin was going to be on it and i adore steve martin 

62.37 63.20 A: mhm 

66.15 66.71 A: (( [cough] )) 

68.04 68.94 A: mhm 

69.73 70.67 A: (( oh [laughter] really )) 

70.76 75.16 B: but i didn't see that he was on there so i decided that it wasn't worth my attention 

75.40 82.09 B: and other than that i just i really haven't watched it because in general i think it's really [laughter] stupid [laughter] 

82.19 94.39 A: yeah it does [lipsmack] i liked i liked the celebrity one they're 'cause they was like you see celebrities and they're always acting so proper and stuff like that but on the actual t._v. show it wasn't like that at all 

90.71 92.14 B: [laughter] yeah 

94.02 95.29 B: oh yeah 

94.48 99.74 A: they would fight back and forth and it was just it made for good t._v. actually 

97.15 98.36 B: yeah 

99.17 104.37 B: well i did see a little bit of it with uh was it joan rivers' daughter 

103.24 105.25 A: mhm yeah 

104.67 114.89 B: and i just think that joan rivers and her daughter are just so incredibly low class [laughter] so so i thought [mn] and actually i think that's why 

110.21 111.64 A: [mn] yeah yeah 

114.79 120.07 B: most people watch reality t._v. it really panders to the lowest common denominator 

119.85 124.68 A: she actually won it though surprisingly yeah she was she came out on top 

121.32 123.78 B: oh did she [laughter] 

124.28 131.26 B: oh did she well good for her [laughter] i guess it pays to have a little bit of chutzpah huh [laughter] 

129.03 136.46 A: yeah [laughter] the only thing i really like about reality t._v. is you get to see sometimes like the [noise] other side 

136.47 137.58 B: yeah 

136.97 138.10 A: oh shit 

137.99 139.44 B: [laughter] 

139.95 140.88 A: oh man 

142.16 144.97 A: [noise] i'm sorry hold on 

142.40 143.78 B: just ignore them 

150.26 151.26 B: hello 

150.74 155.05 A: you still there okay i'm i'm not sure what happened there but 

151.39 153.34 B: (( yeah ))

155.25 156.93 A: okay sorry about that 

156.23 157.71 B: oh no problem 

156.94 158.42 A: anyway where were we 

158.34 159.44 B: um 

158.44 170.26 A: yeah i was saying about the other side of uh how like i said like the celebrities live and with the osbournes on m._t._v. how those i like to see the drama i don't like the whole 

164.60 165.65 B: uh-huh 

170.44 173.67 A: um bachelorette that's that's boring to me 

173.23 175.72 B: uh-huh well you know 

176.33 183.27 B: i guess to to an extent it's always fun to watch pretty people i mean in general they're all very pretty they're all very attractive 

179.75 181.52 A: mhm 

182.73 183.65 A: mhm 

183.28 186.93 B: but it seems to me that that's all that they're chosen for 

186.41 188.32 A: oh yeah like the like uh 

188.54 191.27 A: did you see the new one mr personality 

190.72 192.38 B: no i haven't seen that one 

191.49 196.00 A: yeah that's a new one all the guys walk around in masks 

195.64 197.14 B: [laughter] 

196.34 201.74 A: and the lady you know is you know she's supposed to pick one of them or whatever 

201.25 202.35 B: yeah 

201.78 205.34 A: and she just goes by their personality and how they act 

204.94 212.34 B: well i heard about that on the radio it was being advertised on the radio and i heard that one of the men said that he couldn't take it anymore 

211.96 215.66 A: yeah yeah a couple of them did actually that night yeah the first one 

214.51 218.79 B: well and why was that what was their um problem with it 

218.14 222.71 A: well i guess they couldn't hide behind the mask anymore i don't know that 

222.02 224.97 B: they felt that that was being untruthful 

224.56 228.76 A: i guess the one did the one actually i guess they had a party there 

228.88 230.28 A: and [mn] one 

230.34 232.82 A: actually snuck off with another girl 

232.61 234.87 B: (( [laughter] )) 

232.86 236.15 A: and they were getting getting friendly in the bathroom 

235.84 237.52 B: oh my yeah 

236.28 239.10 A: and i guess he couldn't have that on his conscience 

238.86 245.22 B: oh well i i guess he should have thought of that before he [laughter] well 

239.99 241.15 A: so he left 

245.23 249.77 B: yeah i all in all i'd have to say i'm not too impressed by any of those shows 

249.29 253.79 A: no i actually i don't watch much t._v. but when i when i catch it i mean 

253.03 254.08 B: uh-huh 

253.82 257.03 A: one that's all that's on right now it's 

255.78 262.46 B: well i've heard that there's even going to be a reality network reality t._v. network yeah 

260.14 261.52 A: oh really 

261.77 266.26 A: well that's all that seems to be one right just one after the other after the other 

267.54 270.58 A: what about american idol is that do you think that's reality t._v. 

270.46 280.54 B: now is that the one where um people sing and perform and such and is that the one with that other rude person that very attractive australian man [mn] 

273.64 275.60 A: yeah they sing yeah 

279.82 282.15 A: oh him yeah simon yep 

281.41 286.37 B: yeah well i you know i've i've seen him on i think it was oprah that i saw him on 

285.84 286.99 A: mhm 

286.35 296.59 B: and he is very attractive but he's he's kind of rude [laughter] and obnoxious i think that all started with that other show um 

288.20 288.78 A: (( mm )) 

291.03 292.35 A: yeah yeah 

292.61 293.80 A: he's a rude guy 

296.91 300.25 B: oh gosh who was that awful woman um 

300.52 302.52 B: you are the weakest link 

301.92 305.93 A: oh yeah yeah yeah the weakest link yeah 

302.87 303.93 B: that's where 

304.21 306.48 B: yeah i mean i wanted to hurt her 

305.98 307.02 A: uh-huh 

306.80 310.08 B: [laughter] i i don't know i guess 

310.23 320.38 B: i've i've got kind of an issue about people having such poor manners and being so rude and i i can't understand why people find it so appealing on t._v. 

314.25 315.17 A: uh-huh 

315.47 316.41 A: mhm 

320.11 327.18 A: i think yeah that that seems to be a really really good selling point for shows like that people being rude and 

325.06 326.40 B: yeah 

326.36 339.70 B: yeah yeah and it just [sigh] i don't know it seems to be the way a lot of people want to act these days and i don't understand it and i and i don't understand what people find appealing about watching it i mean 

339.55 344.25 B: i kind of just vote with my my controller and turn it off 

343.64 344.83 A: mhm 

344.58 346.47 B: um [laughter] 

345.61 352.24 A: i think that might be why because so many people don't act that way on a daily basis 

351.62 354.20 B: oh really you don't think so 

352.30 354.65 A: yeah well 

354.25 357.23 B: do you drive shannon [laughter] 

355.20 357.59 A: yes i do i do yeah 

357.30 358.50 B: yeah 

357.93 364.31 A: not not very far but i do i don't have to go too far to where i got to go but 

359.50 360.76 B: yeah 

361.46 363.51 B: uh-huh [mn] yeah 

363.76 365.43 B: well [mn] i 

366.07 373.50 B: you know it's it's a funny thing i mean it sounds like a dichotomy and i i actually believe that there are a lot of really wonderful people in this world 

372.75 374.01 A: mhm where are you from 

373.95 382.17 B: um well i'm right now i live in california but i've lived in a lot of different places um born and raised in missouri 

377.38 378.18 A: (( oh )) 

379.12 380.42 A: mhm 

381.80 383.90 A: mhm 

382.31 389.77 B: but uh you know lived in alaska and florida and washington state and northern california lots of different places 

385.34 386.42 A: oh really 

388.13 388.80 A: (( phew )) 

388.93 390.64 A: yeah 

390.34 402.05 B: and and i think in general [sigh] um there are a lot of nice people but [sigh] like out on the road and just out and about it just seems like good manners have died an ugly death 

401.50 403.28 A: yeah 

402.19 403.58 B: you know people 

404.02 412.46 B: don't hold doors open for each other or you know are polite when they drive and drive recklessly and and i think those shows are kind of a reflection 

409.44 410.54 A: mhm 

412.88 417.66 B: of the general attitude that people have for each other which is basically me first 

417.08 419.08 A: yeah that's that's true 

418.71 419.71 B: yeah 

419.25 421.79 A: and they seem to be so prominent i 

421.84 426.48 A: that's the one thing that gets me there's just one after the other and they're all 

426.47 437.60 A: basically the same they all have the same type of idea a girl picks a guy out of a crowd a guy picks a girl out of a crowd there's a millionaire you know 

428.64 429.84 B: yeah 

430.40 431.29 B: yeah 

435.28 436.44 B: yeah 

437.26 444.90 B: yeah well i guess that that appeals to our basic american fantasy doesn't it if you're pretty enough you're going to get a really wealthy man 

444.36 445.64 A: right right 

445.63 446.47 B: um 

445.83 451.47 A: although i haven't found any of the guys attractive yet on any on really any of the shows i saw 

450.75 463.53 B: [mn] yeah yeah well i like i say i really haven't seen it enough to to be able sure to be sure i thought that joe millionaire was kind of attractive in a simian sort [laughter] of way [laughter] 

462.10 466.18 A: [laughter] he was kind of like a neanderthal to me [laughter] 

464.99 469.32 B: yeah well but and and until he opens his mouth you know 

467.71 470.29 A: oh yeah he was kind of yeah 

469.35 477.81 B: yeah if he could've just stood there and flexed he would've been fine but [laughter] but he was boring and 

471.92 474.19 A: yeah yeah 

477.08 482.42 A: that was a good it was actually a good um um [lipsmack] a surprise ending i'd say 

482.79 484.30 B: how did it end 

483.36 488.80 A: it was a nice i i liked that they actually lied to the people 

489.00 490.05 B: oh 

489.45 492.98 A: like to me that was that did you watch that at all 

492.45 500.55 B: well i had heard about it 'cause everybody talked about it you know you turn on the radio and they were talking about it apparently he wasn't really a millionaire 

495.82 496.77 A: yeah 

499.42 503.36 A: yeah exactly they were they were lying to the girls the whole time 

502.65 505.46 B: but they gave them some money at the end didn't they 

504.37 507.50 A: yeah they did give a million dollars at the end 

506.45 508.63 B: yeah did he end up with that girl 

508.44 509.77 A: he 

510.00 517.80 A: there was something about he he was away from her for like three months after the show they couldn't see each other or something 

515.48 516.40 B: uh-huh 

517.35 518.24 B: uh-huh 

517.88 526.08 A: and i didn't hear what happened after that but with five hundred thousand dollars i'd i'd leave i'd stay i mean it wouldn't [laughter] 

520.73 521.71 B: (( oh )) 

525.28 529.97 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

526.32 528.29 A: take the money and run if you have to 

528.82 530.09 A: you got the million 

530.18 531.23 B: well 

531.30 542.54 B: [mn] i i admit it would be hard to pass up a million dollars and you know if somebody said you know you have a chance to to be with a handsome man and a million dollars that has its appeal 

543.18 550.52 B: but uh boy i think it would be a terribly humiliating circumstance to be in you know with all those women 

549.81 551.82 A: yeah 

550.65 552.82 B: and [mn] i know that 

553.03 559.48 B: for me if a lot of people are vying for the same man i back away because i just don't enjoy that kind of 

559.92 561.64 B: [sigh] competition 

561.60 565.82 A: yeah a lot of those girls they were they were gold diggers just after the million 

565.47 567.60 B: sure yeah 

566.17 574.17 A: but the one the one who ended up with him seemed pretty seems pretty genuine she's kind of kind of a down home down to earth girl 

570.97 572.50 B: yeah 

573.77 579.50 B: [laughter] well i guess that's good yeah i wonder if it worked out for them 

579.10 580.05 A: (( i don't know )) 

579.76 583.42 B: yeah so tell me was steve martin on that one 

583.47 585.37 A: no he wasn't 

583.99 585.77 B: one show he wasn't huh 

585.51 588.88 A: it was people like melissa 

586.90 588.78 B: gee i wonder why i thought that 

589.01 590.40 A: melissa rivers 

590.38 595.15 B: actually i'm very glad to hear that he wasn't on it because i think he's way too classy for that sort 

596.20 598.32 B: um well i wonder what that was 

597.71 598.79 A: i don't know 

598.98 599.89 B: (( hm ))
