114.57 118.29 B: i've never watched any of the reality shows 

117.82 118.73 A: really 

118.30 119.93 B: the closest i've come 

120.00 122.65 B: would be commercials about them 

122.10 123.47 A: [laughter] 

122.80 125.72 B: and even those i flip past really fast 

126.50 129.60 A: yeah most of 'em i just i 

129.65 130.96 A: never cared for 

130.89 132.61 B: (( [noise] oh [mn] )) 

132.80 135.76 A: like the the whole survivor thing 

135.17 136.24 B: mhm 

135.79 136.73 A: (( you know )) 

137.91 139.63 B: well so i 

139.81 142.10 B: d- do a lot of your friends like 'em 

142.85 149.13 B: 'cause i'm just thinking i don't know m- i'd i'd say most people that i know don't like them 

142.91 144.43 A: (( that just um )) 

149.58 154.67 B: or at least they think they're stupid and they don't say they watch them you know 

154.79 156.73 A: yeah i don't 

155.52 158.45 B: so i'm just wonder why they're so popular 

159.42 164.22 A: well now i know that joe millionaire i know a lot of people that watched that 

163.65 167.37 B: oh okay that's true i guess i knew some people who watch that 

166.99 176.43 A: especially like at my wife's office i mean they had you know all the little office bets going on about who was going to be picked and eliminated and 

170.08 171.49 B: [laughter] 

174.04 176.34 B: oh goodness 

176.65 177.55 B: (( [laughter] )) 

176.80 180.70 A: but that one i did know a lot of people that watched but 

180.12 181.15 B: [mn] 

181.94 184.71 A: other than that one nah i don't know 

184.57 191.17 B: i think they'd started with m._t._v. with the whole real world thing and the rolled road rules 

190.92 192.59 A: yeah 

191.62 196.78 B: and i knew people who loved that but that's about it 

197.23 203.34 B: and now all the other reality shows are just kind of like taking that but adding a new twist 

201.92 208.87 A: i don't know they're getting they're getting desperate i think [laughter] you know trying to come up with ideas for them 

204.31 205.60 B: yeah 

208.29 211.75 B: yeah they need to stop doing that [sigh] 

212.79 215.13 A: i know there was one they were trying to ah 

215.31 222.17 A: trying to do and i think it didn't take off it didn't do well but it was um i saw it advertised it was they were gonna take a bunch of people 

222.00 233.55 A: from like kentucky and they're calling it the real beverly hillbillies they're gonna take this family from kentucky and put 'em in some mansion in ah in beverly hills 

226.11 227.28 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

227.74 229.31 B: oh 

230.81 232.08 B: [laughter] 

232.47 234.37 B: that's terrible 

233.74 242.00 A: and like the servants were all in on it and so like the serva- each each week one family member was gonna get eliminated for doing something really stupid 

241.37 242.97 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

242.13 250.13 A: and like the servants were in on it and like watching them i never actually saw it aired though i only saw the commercial for it so 

244.63 245.47 B: (( oh )) 

245.73 246.56 B: (( god )) 

249.96 254.12 B: i bet the people were so humiliated they tried not to get it aired 

253.31 254.43 A: [laughter] 

254.97 256.44 B: (( oh )) 

256.48 258.24 B: that sounds absurd hm 

260.92 261.94 A: (( ah i don't know )) 

263.65 266.40 A: so you've never watched any of them at all mm 

266.61 275.72 B: i don't think so i've never even seen an episode of real world or rolled road rules or like survivor or 

275.79 277.42 B: (( big brother )) 

277.73 278.89 B: like i've 

278.95 283.09 B: i know all the names of them and i've seen commercials for them 

282.74 284.31 A: yeah 

283.31 288.08 B: and every now and then i'll flip through them but i've never actually watched 

288.10 291.01 B: like more than a minute of it anything 

292.26 300.46 A: the survivor i just ah i think it's stupid i don't think they're surviving anything if one of 'em gets injured they medivac them to a hospital so 

296.59 297.53 B: [laughter] 

299.70 301.61 B: [laughter] 

300.87 304.70 A: you know what what is there that you're surviving exactly 

304.20 305.82 B: yeah 

305.09 310.22 A: you got all your corporate sponsors you know you're wearing your nike tennis shoes and [laughter] 

308.58 309.77 B: [laughter] 

310.14 311.36 B: (( yeah )) 

311.92 317.75 A: [mn] and i watched the movie castaway and ah that would be more of a survivor situation 

316.92 320.87 B: oh hm never saw that that seemed interesting mm 

320.68 322.59 A: oh it was a really good movie 

323.89 325.17 A: but 

326.54 330.09 B: yeah i mean that's the thing about reality t._v. it's not 

330.24 342.09 B: like it's not really real it like it tries to be but there it really can't be like it's not actually possible because people know the cameras are there 

332.87 333.65 A: yeah 

342.34 343.76 A: exactly 

344.04 346.37 A: they don't act like they normally would 

345.85 352.25 B: right and i i'll bet there are plenty of situations that are set up you know 

353.54 355.69 B: (( so i don't know [sigh] )) 

356.67 363.98 A: yeah i think they i think the draw for the for the networks is you know simply they don't have to pay actors 

362.87 364.97 B: free acting yeah 

364.90 368.90 A: pay a bunch a spoilt actors millions of dollars for each episode 

369.11 378.10 B: yeah that's true no wonder they can give those million dollar prizes away so easily they don't need to pay a cast 

375.07 381.40 A: oh yeah well i mean look at like friends all all six of the major cast members on friends 

381.46 385.53 A: pull in like one point seven million per episode 

385.98 386.91 B: whoa 

386.33 392.93 A: you know so they're they're paying out like ten million bucks just for those six people's salaries for each show 

391.70 392.35 B: (( wow )) 

393.50 395.95 B: i never realised how much they 

393.98 394.77 A: so 

396.36 397.77 B: they made 

398.00 400.62 A: yeah they're ridiculously high paid 

400.11 402.11 B: (( [laughter] ha )) 

402.45 405.52 B: i guess i watch t._v. to escape reality 

405.20 406.87 A: [laughter] 

406.23 413.05 B: so if reality television kind of works against the whole idea for me 

409.37 410.11 A: [laughter] 

412.97 414.59 A: yeah 

414.41 415.09 B: (( oh )) 

416.51 423.30 A: yeah and i just think the whole with the whole dating and marriage thing i mean that's been the latest craze you know in the last or so 

421.75 423.83 B: i just think it's unethical 

423.33 425.37 A: yeah i think it's 

424.47 425.25 B: (( ugh )) 

425.43 428.23 A: well and i think they're they're they're 

428.27 430.27 A: kind of degrading marriage 

430.22 432.06 B: yeah 

430.86 437.41 A: you know they're they're trying to like well like the one where married by america where they had a bunch of people that was just 

435.05 436.71 B: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

436.75 449.31 B: yeah well you know what i think it's us who are degrad- not li- like us as in society who are degrading marriage because they are all these people watching it and thereby supporting it 

444.72 445.62 A: oh yeah 

449.37 454.59 B: you know and then of course there were the people who signed up to be on there 

449.44 450.16 A: (( yep [laughter] )) 

454.64 456.68 B: to begin with you know 

456.61 457.53 A: mhm 

457.63 458.60 B: so 

459.35 461.43 B: that works just feed into it 

459.38 465.88 A: well and i mean you hear the news reports none of the couples from any of those shows are still together 

463.73 465.43 B: [laughter] i know 

465.68 467.10 B: (( yeah )) 

466.39 468.65 A: you know now they like hate each other 

468.45 469.36 B: (( uh-huh )) 

468.92 477.22 A: i know the ones from the millionaire the the joe millionaire guy and the girl that he finally picked i know they're both like ragging on each other in the media 

472.03 472.94 B: uh-huh 

476.42 478.37 B: oh that's so sad [laughter] 

477.47 479.65 A: they can't stand each other 

479.05 480.05 B: (( [laughter] )) 

480.29 492.17 B: well then of cour- well that's but that's the thing though like even these marriage things they don't seem that real to me because you know okay so it doesn't work out they can just divorce and it's just 

481.35 482.28 A: so 

491.80 492.71 A: yeah 

492.18 495.61 B: okay so they got married on t._v. oh wow big 

495.67 496.58 B: deal 

495.70 504.16 A: well and how how well can you really get to know somebody when [laughter] you're competing with thirty other people just for five minutes of their time 

501.94 503.53 B: yeah 

504.06 505.95 B: yeah exactly 

504.71 514.66 A: and you know you know like it's like like with joe millionaire it's this big contest so you know none of the girls are really gonna be themselves because they're all in the contest to win 

512.10 513.16 B: right 

514.22 516.14 B: yeah exactly 

515.18 516.17 A: so 

516.58 517.45 B: (( ha )) 

517.77 520.58 A: not like a real relationship but 

520.01 520.81 B: (( [laughter] )) 

521.64 522.54 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

522.74 526.39 A: i don't know they're still trying 'em now they've got that mr personality 

526.33 527.81 B: [laughter]

543.47 544.44 A: [laughter] 

545.19 546.82 B: (( at least we're in agreement )) 

548.49 554.45 B: although it'd probably make for a livelier conversation had we not been in agreement 

554.21 555.44 A: [laughter] 

554.85 555.65 B: hm 

561.15 563.62 B: are we just waiting for ten minutes bells 

563.39 564.56 A: yeah i think so 

564.21 567.59 B: [laughter] oh 

567.01 581.46 A: i mean i don't know what else to say about 'em i mean just i think you know a few people watch different i think that's the thing there's so many of 'em out there like we actually liked the amazing race 'cause i thought it i mean it actually that one was pretty cool 

569.65 571.07 B: yeah 

575.59 576.92 B: yeah 

580.74 584.83 B: yeah well i could i could see that appealing to people who like to travel
