248.98 250.72 B: you know what i'm saying i'm 

250.85 260.48 B: this is not this is this is a thing against bush this is not against our military has nothing to do with our military our military does what

410.23 417.03 A: that was when disagreements stop you you have to support your troops period we're there 

415.44 419.55 B: right did you just recently get back or were you did you go there

436.98 437.90 A: um 

437.16 439.22 B: right 

437.97 441.48 A: you know uh so like i said the minute that we put 

441.57 444.49 A: the minute that we put our feet on the soil 

443.21 447.78 B: well we did go in there for a reason and that was because bush told us 

447.81 452.77 B: that this was a coun- country that threatened us with weapons of mass destru- destruction 

452.81 454.43 A: (( but if you've known )) 

452.96 456.68 B: now we were they were never a threat to us 

454.61 456.12 A: for the taliban 

456.54 459.91 B: and we had no right to preempt a war against them 

459.71 469.95 B: now india may preempt a war against pakistan because if america can do it if america can do it if president bush can do it then other countries can too 

469.72 477.37 B: this is setting a very dangerous precedent if we can go against the u._n. then other countries can 

473.57 478.41 A: well you know what they set dangerous precedent when they put two planes into 

478.48 480.06 A: the two towers 

480.38 481.47 B: excuse me 

481.38 487.03 A: they put they put a very dangerous precedent when they flew two planes into our towers 

487.12 491.18 B: who's they not iraq the taliban did that 

490.05 496.87 A: they have they have ties with taliban they've linked them because they've linked saddam hussein who do you think was the money behind it 

491.29 492.99 B: the taliban is 

496.80 508.36 B: the taliban have cells all over the world not just there there's there's no they have found one one small group of people who were from the taliban 

497.44 498.15 A: they 

501.40 503.74 A: right but who do you think is funding 

503.78 505.28 A: (( osama bin laden )) 

508.42 516.98 B: in iraq and i read the paper and on the computer i read the paper every day and they found one small cell of about six men who were 

517.57 519.19 B: with the taliban 

519.30 533.88 B: okay the taliban is originated in afghanistan and they're all saudi arabians they're not iraqis they're not iranians syrians indians pakistanis they are 

519.42 523.07 A: and they've also linked money money from saddam to osama 

534.06 541.30 B: ninety nine percent saudi arabia why did we go attack a country who had absolutely nothing to do with nine eleven 

540.79 545.12 A: because saddam has been giving them money 

545.62 555.58 A: and the small cell are the people that have been running the country we're not fighting the war against the iraqi people we're fighting the war against the people in power 

551.53 554.54 B: well i w- i won't believe that until i see 

554.72 558.10 B: some proof that saddam was giving them money 

558.15 563.53 B: saddam was giving himself money you see his six palaces along the 

558.31 559.72 A: they found it 

563.52 573.18 B: tigris river you know he was giving himself the money he wasn't giving it anybody else believe me if he was he would have given it to the poor people in his own country 

573.60 582.71 A: are you kidding me he is the one that's imprisoning the poor people in his own country he is the one that's been throwing the children in jail 

578.90 581.35 B: he's oppressing them 

581.76 584.37 B: he's oppressing them and he's also 

585.51 588.57 A: so he certainly wouldn't be giving his money to them 

585.52 590.96 B: because he is a dictator if they say something that he doesn't like he'll have them killed 

591.31 594.23 B: there's no doubt about that i'm not saying that's 

592.42 597.16 A: but there's no reason why he'd be giving them any money he's not he's giving them to 

595.35 599.95 B: i'm not saying that what he was doing was right i'm just saying what we did was
