16.83 17.82 B: uh-huh 

17.18 19.04 A: right um 

18.25 24.15 B: no the topic for today is ah about the arms in iraq 

23.88 30.53 A: oh well when i just came on the line they told me right reality t._v. shows so i guess maybe it's different for each person 

29.93 32.58 B: oh no [laughter] 

31.98 35.96 A: i don't know well anyway reality t._v. shows 

36.25 41.59 A: about that i like some of 'em [lipsmack] some of 'em i don't like now um 

42.14 47.48 A: [lipsmack] joe millionaire that was pretty good but i kind of lost interest in it 'cause it drag on too long 

48.24 51.52 A: [noise] um let me see i don't know whether um 

51.89 53.31 A: [lipsmack] whether um 

53.36 57.99 A: what is that show i watch it every week um not star search but what's the other one 

59.12 60.01 A: um 

59.22 60.89 B: american idol [noise] 

60.24 63.60 A: yeah yeah yeah american idol now i watch that 

63.93 68.70 A: [lipsmack] basically almost every week but that's it drags on too long for me 

68.72 76.31 A: so i kind of start to lose interest in it but anyway i think if ruben don't win it's a set up anyway 'cause he better than all the rest of 'em 

76.04 77.54 B: [laughter] 

77.28 82.52 A: that's my opinion um [lipsmack] but i think they just drag 'em out too long 

81.63 94.36 B: really 'cause i haven't seen any of those so i [laughter] i couldn't tell you [laughter] i hear about 'em a lot from my friends but um just in case so we've covered the reality t._v. 

84.71 86.45 A: where you calling from 

88.51 89.50 A: uh-huh 

93.16 94.91 A: [laughter] 

94.43 100.19 B: ah let's cover they they were asking if it should be a priority for the u._s. 

100.40 111.06 B: to ah do disarmament in ah iraq and i think it's important i don't know if it should be top priority you know at the top of the list but 

103.63 104.68 A: (( mhm )) 

107.93 109.00 A: right 

111.93 115.62 B: the last i heard they haven't found all these ah 

115.74 118.27 B: supposed sophisticated 

117.88 120.89 A: weap- weaponries uh-huh 

119.61 120.82 B: yeah 

120.91 126.40 A: but see you know my my opinion on that is when they went over there i believe it was in ninety two 

126.27 127.19 B: uh-huh 

127.09 137.53 A: and supposedly had disarmed them um then and then rid them of chemical weapons and then from my understanding they have a satellite in the sky 

138.05 147.03 A: um over those countries so they basically can see what they doing so if they had the satellites and so you do they can see what they doing 

147.11 149.91 A: why if they had 

149.88 155.33 A: these so called new sophisticated weapons why didn't they see what was going on then 

154.36 155.92 B: yeah right 

155.18 167.60 A: and how did they in just ten years' time come up with all these old sophisticated weapons in these third world countries i really my opinion is is i believe it's about the oil 

168.11 169.06 A: um 

169.53 180.02 A: i believe that united states basically wants to get their hands on that foreign oil um now i do believe that um saddam hussain was a evil dictator 

179.57 180.58 B: oh sure [noise] 

180.11 194.18 A: i do believe that i do believe that he treated his own people wrong he lived like kings while his people lived like paupers um i do believe that but i don't believe that it's just basically about what they say it's about 

193.60 195.22 B: yeah yeah 

194.21 198.91 A: you know i it's a lot more to it than they let us 

196.53 199.64 B: oh sure there always is right 

199.24 206.94 A: yeah it's a lot more to it so i think basically it's about the oil and them you know trying to control the oil or the 

206.84 216.06 A: now they say that they're gonna lift sanctions and i don't know it's it's really so confusing because you really don't know who's telling the truth 

215.48 225.59 B: exactly and everything changes each day just about you know one day you hear one thing and th- it is like you said very confusing [laughter] 

219.53 220.72 A: yeah from 

223.97 232.63 A: yeah from day to day everything just changes [lipsmack] you don't know who's telling the truth i remember ah hearing a quote from mother teresa 

232.54 241.63 A: and she said that she didn't watch the television and she didn't read the newspaper because she wanted to know the truth and that kind of like 

241.79 249.83 A: sums it up 'cause you don't what to believe just like their um media was controlled by the government 

250.34 263.18 A: [noise] so is ours i mean you know what i mean so we see and hear every what they want us to see and read and hear and other countries do the same so i really don't see what the big deal is with that 

251.43 252.43 B: yeah 

263.05 269.37 A: but i do believe that they did the right thing in going over there and getting rid of saddam hussain 

268.51 270.37 B: absolutely yeah 

269.53 280.93 A: but but now with these you do wonder okay now where do we go from here you see i believe that the united states is probably gonna set up a base over there now so now there'll be um 

273.50 274.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

281.12 292.12 A: [lipsmack] a united states base in ah in iraq or wherever they put it so the united states um will continually have some interest in those countries 

292.11 303.37 A: so but what are they gonna do now that they they don't know whether the man is dead or alive so what are they gonna do say okay well we done our job let's go home now so i don't understand what the end result of this is gonna be 

303.14 311.86 B: [noise] right right that they they kind of left us hanging there because that now all we're hearing is about them searching for all the weapons 

306.64 307.84 A: yeah 

311.54 312.74 A: yeah 

312.05 315.09 B: that they there supposedly was you know 

314.71 315.91 A: uh-huh 

315.23 324.10 B: and so far they haven't come up with anything well you know it's wasting a lot of time and money continually searching you know 

318.86 320.32 A: not much of them 

323.54 325.65 A: mhm 

324.50 330.03 B: i mean 'cause this equipment's supposed to be big so you would think you know 

327.65 328.84 A: yeah 

329.63 342.76 A: that how come they haven't found it yet it it starts to believe it starts to lead you to believe does it exist like they said they had to go storm in there and find it so bad 

332.07 333.23 B: right 

342.18 343.56 B: right right 

343.41 345.01 A: and hm 

345.41 347.24 A: i don't understa- 

346.30 352.96 B: the last i heard they found nothing i mean if there was so much something would've showed by now 

348.40 349.56 A: (( i know )) 

350.25 351.38 A: (( i know )) 

352.22 356.85 A: an american um war i i'm not really um 

356.99 363.23 A: a prejudiced person but i'd say we all bleed the same color red 

362.91 364.93 B: oh absolutely 

363.44 367.55 A: so just like um our american soldiers 

367.77 374.36 A: died fighting for their country and mothers lost sons and children lost fathers well so did their side 

374.58 375.55 B: yeah 

374.78 375.85 A: you know 

376.34 387.30 A: [lipsmack] and they they they they they were reportedly had the heaviest casualties but they had mothers and children and sisters and brothers who who are grieving for them also so i'm really 

387.51 391.21 A: i really don't think war benefits anybody 

391.38 392.44 A: you know 

392.02 393.20 B: yeah 

392.97 398.21 A: because before they before they decided that they were gonna 

398.31 409.93 A: go over and and oust him and to take him you didn't hear anything about he was causing so much trouble and [lipsmack] this was happening and that was happening you didn't hear anything about that 

410.65 412.55 A: um but i really don't 

412.59 421.87 A: i don't know i guess i just don't understand the ways of the government and the ways of the country 'cause it seems like to me united states is always going to somebody else's house 

422.04 422.76 B: (( ha )) 

422.07 426.58 A: and starting a fight [laughter] you know [laughter] 

423.44 425.23 B: right yeah 

425.84 431.16 B: and some are fights just to keep publicity going or something you know [laughter] 

428.56 433.91 A: yeah or to keep money generating and things like that now 

431.94 433.34 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

434.12 435.79 A: [lipsmack] i'm calling um 

435.97 444.04 A: from west philadelphia and i'm and i have been basically following the news coverage [noise] and i said well 

444.11 444.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

445.12 451.72 A: when they showed the part where they were um delivering conveys of food and staples and things to 

451.04 451.91 B: uh-huh 

451.87 457.68 A: the iraqi people i said now wait a minute i've never seen a convoy of food come down my street 

457.44 459.45 B: yeah right [laughter] 

458.03 459.47 A: you know i mean 

459.78 462.55 A: really because there's um children 

462.48 475.30 A: there there's children and and people that are hungry that go to bed hungry and there's there's lacking things right here in the united states what about helping these people first before you go decide to help somebody else 

475.60 479.77 A: and i don't know that just seemed always just seemed backwards to me 

480.03 481.23 B: yeah 

480.60 484.90 A: now i was reading in the paper yesterday how 

484.85 496.89 A: because of the war efforts and the money that they're using to spend that that a lot of um programs were cut for like poor people underprivileged people 

496.66 497.56 B: uh-huh 

496.97 505.28 A: like um program energy assistance programs and things like that so who is really benefiting from this war 

504.98 512.47 B: right right that's why you know it it is important to find these weapons if they ah do exist but 

511.45 512.26 A: mhm 

512.42 520.57 B: the question was should it be a priority you know and no way you know like if that there's much more important things to take care of right here 

514.83 515.88 A: right 

516.22 517.24 A: right 

520.23 524.01 A: mhm exactly i think it was 

520.58 521.55 B: you know 

524.19 527.34 A: i thought i'm kind of think it was a ego thing 

527.56 540.08 A: when the u._n. inspectors went over there and saddam hussein refused to disclose information and he refused to let them search in different places i think basically he was just bluffing 

540.86 547.52 B: [noise] ah excellent possibility 'cause now they can search all they want right and they come up with nothing 

541.09 542.29 A: (( you )) 

542.95 544.01 A: (( know yeah )) 

545.13 546.35 A: right 

547.14 548.15 A: so 

548.33 552.94 A: i think and i think i think he's a liar because i don't think 

553.01 557.13 A: that he would you know being as though he knew what was coming 

557.29 558.42 B: oh sure 

557.90 561.50 A: i don't think that he'd sit around and wait for it to get there 

560.44 564.82 B: i know right just kicking back waiting no i know 

561.54 562.71 A: you know 

564.04 575.93 A: so so yeah he'll probably pop up ten years from now or even his sons or representatives or something like that i don't think they've heard the last of him he probably sitting somewhere laughing 

576.11 579.45 B: yeah yeah i think he got out you know 

578.44 579.82 A: mhm 

579.90 583.64 B: like you said once he heard he was gone 

582.42 586.06 A: yeah he wasn't gonna sit around 

585.44 593.34 B: and then i heard too about all those those impersonators so when he went he took off he left a couple of them around 

589.16 590.32 A: yeah 

592.66 594.48 A: yeah what's with that 

593.91 598.42 B: i know you know and those poor guys [laughter] gee 

596.17 597.82 A: [laughter] 

598.82 599.89 A: i'd hate to be a
