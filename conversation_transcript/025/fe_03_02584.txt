1.72 2.92 A: hello 

2.42 3.60 B: (( hello )) 

4.00 5.32 A: this is susan 

5.19 6.97 B: hi my name's tracey 

7.19 8.21 A: hi 

9.11 10.52 A: um 

10.41 14.40 B: i wasn't really paying attention when they gave us the topic and all that [laughter] 

14.94 18.28 A: i wasn't either it has to do with um 

17.91 19.57 B: something about iraq 

19.00 26.06 A: yeah what our what what our priorities should be in ir- what should we do in iraq and how do we feel about 

26.44 28.59 A: disarming ir- iraq 

28.24 29.72 B: oh okay 

30.83 31.93 A: so 

31.76 33.35 B: well you wanna go first 

32.73 38.04 A: [laughter] put the toe in the water 

37.60 38.99 B: yeah 

39.63 46.36 A: well i'm probably going to be a hard one to talk to because i don't see things in black and white 

46.09 47.39 B: yeah 

47.47 48.65 A: um 

49.04 50.86 A: my feeling is 

51.10 53.45 B: (( i've got to speak to them for ten minutes )) 

51.16 58.96 A: uh that we don't we are not privy to enough information to make some decisions 

58.65 59.90 B: yeah 

59.49 66.19 A: but certainly if we ever want to get to a uh place of total world peace 

66.56 71.90 A: then that means that those that who truly desire peace can't tolerate tyrants 

71.85 73.11 B: yeah 

73.27 78.66 A: and um whatever that means to someone is kinda where i am 

78.54 79.92 B: mhm 

80.22 83.21 A: so i guess it's your turn [laughter] 

83.18 85.77 B: so is the war over or what 

86.27 93.58 A: uh my understanding is in fact i think uh bush is gonna be on t._v. tonight to to tell us that the 

91.07 91.98 B: yeah 

94.32 100.46 A: the war part is actually over but of course there's still borders that have to be 

100.74 105.14 A: uh maintained because there are threats from outside the borders 

102.30 103.29 B: mhm 

104.99 106.37 B: mhm 

105.74 112.91 A: and uh but as far as as uh pushing in and taking over new territory that part of it's pretty much over with 

112.69 115.10 B: (( yeah mm )) 

114.09 119.87 A: and all the things that so many people that i know were afraid were going to happen didn't happen 

119.58 120.91 B: yeah 

121.26 123.53 B: mm well what were they afraid of 

124.46 125.82 A: retaliation 

125.57 127.09 B: oh yeah 

128.35 143.01 A: and and even i mean everybody was afraid that they did have a nuclear weapon and they did expose it and you know and they would they would do something with it but the truth is is that we don't know whether there's there for all we know there are 

143.20 152.47 A: thousands of square miles of desert where anything could be hidden they could still have one and or they could have imported it to another corner country and 

146.47 147.43 B: yeah 

147.61 148.75 B: yeah 

152.00 153.10 B: right 

152.52 161.30 A: and detonate and detonate it from there so i think the fear of doing nothing is is really not a very good reason to not do nothing 

155.18 156.18 B: mhm 

161.08 162.15 B: yeah 

161.54 162.70 A: myself 

162.34 163.31 B: mhm 

165.19 165.93 B: (( okay )) 

165.86 166.85 A: so 

168.05 170.38 A: anyway you're letting me do all the talking 

169.76 184.08 B: yeah [mn] well i was wondering what ever happened to bin laden i i wasn't paying attention very much in the news and that's all they talked about and then a couple of months later they stopped talking about him and then it was back to saddam what happ- where did he go they just give up 

170.84 171.88 A: [laughter] 

183.97 190.94 A: uh no there's we certainly have a force still in afghanistan but uh nobody knows where bin laden is 

188.23 189.07 B: yeah 

191.00 197.10 B: well i mean that's all they talked about on the news like twenty four hours a day and then they just stopped talking about him 

197.54 206.28 A: well because i think it's it's it's simply a continuous hunt and search thing there really isn't a force 

204.44 205.45 B: mhm 

206.75 211.22 A: to repel like there was uh in the current situation 

210.86 212.33 B: oh yeah 

212.67 220.83 A: so i mean it was just bin laden and a few of his cronies not not the organized militia that 

216.21 217.46 B: yeah 

220.36 221.64 B: yeah 

221.82 231.66 A: we're doing now so once in a while they say something about it but you know that's that's another thing that's the way the news is they whatever the hot topic is at the moment 

228.05 229.36 B: yeah 

231.56 233.10 B: that's what they talk about 

232.46 234.31 A: that's what they talk about 

233.81 235.37 B: mhm 

235.21 242.20 A: and and and of course the the so called war was so juicy because there were so many 

242.23 246.14 A: uh opposing factions to it that that kept it really 

246.33 251.15 A: alive and rocking and rolling i mean i'm not a news buff myself because 

248.33 249.24 B: yeah 

250.04 251.34 B: yeah 

251.38 255.08 A: a lot of this stuff i i have no control over 

254.79 255.80 B: right 

255.56 261.57 A: and uh a lot of it just makes you feel bad so why subject yourself to that 

261.12 262.48 B: yeah 

262.56 271.21 A: so i'm i'm certainly not an expert on anything except my own feelings which are we don't know enough to make 

268.85 269.74 B: (( mhm )) 

271.71 276.51 A: uh some decisions and and we can only make them for ourselves 

273.88 274.75 B: yeah 

276.34 277.43 B: right 

278.82 280.70 B: yeah we just have to trust that 

280.90 286.85 B: the government that we choose to live in is doing things the right way 

287.05 292.80 A: well you see that's the thing as long as people don't vote intelligently or don't vote at all 

291.33 292.16 B: yeah 

292.50 293.66 B: mhm 

293.04 298.23 A: then i mean like the old guy said people usually deserve the governments that they have 

297.87 299.16 B: yeah 

298.97 301.70 A: and we as a people are pretty 

301.86 303.58 A: lax [laughter] 

303.47 304.72 B: yeah 

304.14 311.60 A: in uh a- accountability as far as our representatives go and we uh you know keep voting the same old 

311.84 312.97 A: guys in 

312.73 315.85 B: yeah or you don't vote at all you just do nothing 

316.05 317.38 A: well i can see 

316.06 318.09 B: and then complain about it 

317.42 320.71 A: i can see why a lot of people don't vote because it's 

320.72 322.36 A: they feel helpless 

322.08 323.25 B: yeah 

322.63 326.13 A: because the majority tends to follow whoever 

326.20 332.13 A: is going to offer them something and as long as people are looking for a handout that's the way their votes will go 

331.72 333.09 B: yeah 

332.46 334.24 A: which means they're controlled 

334.18 335.53 B: yeah 

336.23 339.35 A: but you know i'm i'm not prepared to 

339.47 342.72 A: try to change the minds of a couple of hundred million people 

342.42 343.78 B: yeah 

343.16 350.37 A: [laughter] i can i can only control what goes on in my life and the way i treat my neighbors and 

343.98 345.27 B: yeah 

350.13 351.08 B: yeah 

350.50 352.68 A: and hope that uh 

352.95 361.53 A: that spreads far enough i mean it's interesting to hear people talk about god and love and all the other stuff and wanna either kill 

361.78 362.95 A: uh 

363.23 365.80 A: uh saddam or president bush 

365.51 366.38 B: mm 

366.41 368.31 A: it doesn't make sense to me 

368.11 369.66 B: yeah 

370.92 373.18 B: yeah well where do you live 

373.17 374.90 A: i'm in washington state 

374.54 375.59 B: oh wow 

375.83 377.70 B: i'm in a suburb of chicago 

375.91 376.78 A: and you are 

377.42 382.09 A: oh yeah [laughter] so how did you find out about this program 

377.99 379.14 B: yeah 

381.76 383.20 B: money and shopping 

383.53 384.64 B: angela 

386.02 387.86 B: (( you ever hear of that )) 

387.26 387.96 A: (( uh-uh )) 

388.01 396.61 B: oh it's like uh mystery shopping and uh secret shopper type of yeah just yeah 

393.04 395.11 A: oh okay i know what that is 

395.69 397.64 A: is that something that you do 

397.43 399.46 B: yeah mhm 

399.69 414.38 B: so we go out and try to find you know different uh companies that are looking for shoppers or try to get scheduled for different assignments and she has a website and she has uh an email where she send out like generates information 

414.21 423.54 B: and she will only recommend stuff that she thinks is good i mean obviously you don't have to take her up on any of her suggestions but she said this was uh 

423.54 434.20 B: you know legitimate and pretty easy so if you want sign up and i signed up today and i think they've called me on the first available time that i said i was thinking i'd be home [mn] 

430.52 432.63 A: [laughter] 

433.91 435.36 A: yeah me too 

434.92 436.38 B: yeah 

435.74 438.44 A: kinda surprised me because i just signed up yesterday 

438.05 440.01 B: oh i just signed up today 

440.54 442.47 A: that was fast 

441.64 444.13 B: yeah how did you hear about it 

443.70 446.09 A: oh a friend of mine sent me an email 

445.72 447.00 B: yeah 

446.33 449.45 A: she's gotta fr- she knows somebody that 

449.46 454.47 A: um has a group of people that are always looking for ways to generate a little money 

454.02 455.09 B: right 

454.77 460.64 A: and they found it and sent it on to her and she sent it to me so i sent it to a couple of my friends 

460.32 463.76 B: yeah yeah it's kinda the same same idea 

461.56 462.95 A: and 

464.53 468.72 A: i don't know that i really understand uh what they're doing but hey 

467.97 476.15 B: mhm yeah well it sounded more like it was about linguistics like how people speak what they say 

476.58 484.03 B: i don't know accents dialects inflections it kinda sounded like that's what linguistics means to me so i thought that's what they were looking for 

483.86 485.97 A: well that's what 

484.43 487.23 B: i didn't know i'd have to talk about iraq [laughter] 

486.49 490.51 A: the that that's what they say yeah my friend talked about uh 

490.72 492.59 A: food one night 

491.87 495.76 B: (( yeah let me talk about food that would be fun )) 

493.83 495.26 A: (( [mn] )) 

495.89 502.85 A: but i think the question was whether you'd rather go out to dinner and eat or eat at home or something and then it went on from there 

501.10 502.11 B: yeah 

502.46 503.78 B: oh okay 

503.87 507.66 A: but this you know that's not a very controversial subject 

507.24 508.23 B: no 

507.86 512.97 A: and this one is so maybe that makes a difference in what they're looking for i don't have any idea 

509.39 510.35 B: yeah 

512.62 514.20 B: yeah 

513.86 518.32 A: just as long as i don't start getting a bunch of strange phone calls and strange emails 

514.26 515.41 B: people are gonna 

518.35 524.44 B: yeah it well they said it was secure so i went ahead and believed 'em so you know 

524.84 526.91 B: i can always change my email address 

526.74 529.27 A: i i i guess we'll find out huh 

528.67 531.62 B: yeah mhm 

529.51 530.13 A: (( [laughter] )) 

531.85 535.94 A: well i don't know where to go with this i pretty much said what my 

534.76 539.24 B: yeah i don't have a whole lot more [laughter] to say about it anyway 

539.65 540.51 B: so 

539.82 553.59 A: how how are the people in your area in general how have they responded has there been a lot of anger and violence 

545.87 553.01 B: yeah no i haven't seen anything everyone's just kinda living their life every day just like normal just like you know 

553.32 567.23 B: it hasn't really been too much i mean yeah a lot more people have like flags on their car and you know they're wearing the red white and blue stuff but it's not like anything really overtly like dramatic it's just common type of thing 

566.96 569.87 A: and [noise] well actually i think that's good 

567.59 568.49 B: so 

569.47 575.23 B: i mean at first there was a couple of there wasn't really a riot but they were like mass protests that were right 

575.14 585.31 B: in downtown chicago and that caused a big mess but that was like a couple of days after the war started but then after you know kind of a initial you know 

585.38 588.64 B: had a few groups just showing some like 

588.73 598.89 B: just getting on the media just getting on the news it's pretty much quietened down everybody you know they go to work just like they did or do whatever they were doing before and you know 

599.38 599.89 B: (( it does ))
