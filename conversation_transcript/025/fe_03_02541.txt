171.54 179.87 B: yeah they're acting kind of petty about stuff [mn] well i've i always watched real world too the real world 

178.19 180.34 A: yeah i watch that 

180.30 185.89 B: i watch it i don't watch it anymore but i watched it like when it first came out 

186.00 188.01 B: i really enjoyed it 

187.86 192.85 A: i think that's kind of where it started to get um popular m._t._v. started it all oh 

189.55 193.91 B: yeah that's i think it it came like a big fad 

194.20 200.71 B: now it's like everybody and they have like a reality and they're coming out with new ones like all the time 

200.94 203.77 B: i read about them in entertainment weekly 

203.90 205.67 A: what do you think of that um 

205.70 210.23 A: that spring break movie that they made do you think that'll be popular 

208.07 211.26 B: [sigh] i heard about and i heard it was dumb 

211.08 212.27 A: yeah 

212.14 215.28 B: i heard about it on [mn] e. entertainment 

215.30 216.94 B: [lipsmack] the e. channel 

216.68 218.16 A: mhm 

217.53 219.04 B: [lipsmack] on there so 

219.12 224.44 B: and the people said that they saw it for free 'cause i guess so they can like 

225.19 230.82 B: for marketing reasons i guess and they said that they would never pay a penny for it [laughter] 

231.15 237.62 A: yeah i think there's a difference between like you can watch it on television and paying like eight bucks to go watch 

235.20 236.89 B: yeah 

237.14 240.40 B: yeah i just think it's kind of gonna be a big flop 

240.68 245.16 B: it's gonna be like one of those movies that's probably in the movie theater for maybe for two weeks and then it's 

245.33 247.22 B: [laughter] it's gone [laughter] 

246.79 248.19 A: (( yeah [mn] mhm )) 

247.63 252.72 B: [laughter] but it's i think i i i don't i probably would just rent it 

253.35 256.10 B: that'd be one of the ones i would rent but 

256.48 258.31 B: i i enjoy 

258.35 263.31 B: some of it i watch american idol ah because i it's not really reality but 

264.09 265.29 A: yeah 

264.55 266.27 B: it's funny do you watch that 

266.27 268.62 A: i watch that a little bit

274.52 277.44 A: out there singing their hearts out and 

276.33 285.39 B: yeah he's really mean to those people and then in order to get to him i read this in a magazine you have to like go through all these interviews 

285.72 289.18 B: to get on the t._v. you have to go through other people 

288.97 290.47 A: yeah huh mhm 

289.69 293.13 B: you have to sing to other people so they might have stunk 

293.44 302.37 B: like to i mean they might have stunk to like whenever they got to like the t._v. part but they might've they might've been really good like before they 

303.02 310.02 A: yeah i imagine that some people have stage fright you know they could be really good singers but then they just get too nervous 

308.17 309.31 B: (( yeah ))
