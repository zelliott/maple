33.69 34.77 A: [laughter] 

35.88 37.22 A: [laughter] 

36.40 38.59 B: but [laughter] 

37.25 40.06 A: well hm let me see [laughter] 

38.87 41.30 B: yeah well i know well 

40.40 42.41 A: what's your what's your view on that 

42.27 45.90 B: [mn] i feel that um 

47.41 50.17 B: [mn] i'm just i feel like 

50.27 54.60 B: we're doing what we can you know everything we can i think we've done 

51.98 53.20 A: yeah yeah 

54.80 69.14 B: our best you know um i don't know if we're going to find the smoking guns but you know [laughter] yeah so but i i as far as imposing democracy on them i don't know if we can do that i mean i'm wondering if they can accept it 

56.35 57.51 A: yeah 

58.99 63.43 A: [laughter] yeah i i wonder i know [laughter] 

68.55 73.35 A: uh i'm wondering the same thing i'm watching and they're they just don't seem to be 

70.27 71.25 B: mhm 

74.09 81.67 A: i don't know acting the way uh [mn] i think i don't know they're just acting strange over there and i don't know what's the 

81.76 86.02 B: yeah i don't know if you can change a whole culture and uh um 

84.06 89.23 A: i know i know i mean i know they're probably glad saddam's gone and everything but i just don't 

88.49 98.15 B: yeah i and i really wish they would start talking too so we would [mn] hear hear a little more you know about so people would get behind u- so that you know it it would look 

92.27 93.10 A: (( [mn] )) 

98.29 106.35 B: so i think it should embarrass the arab world a little bit and i think they need that shame a little bit more too and so 

101.90 102.85 A: yeah 

103.77 105.73 A: (( yeah yeah i mean )) 

105.96 111.72 A: i'm gla- i mean i'm glad we went over there i think we needed to because you know i i think they were 

108.45 109.38 B: mhm 

111.93 117.04 A: somewhat behind terrorism and i think they needed to be taken out you know that 

113.68 115.01 B: well yeah 

115.86 124.85 B: well and i think that i think that helped towards the terrorism because did did you hear yesterday they said it's the lowest point of terrorism since like nineteen sixty five or something 

124.60 125.60 A: wow 

124.99 139.49 B: that's what they said and so i think this show of force is helpful i- if just for a psychological standpoint you know in that neck of the woods and plus finding all that money i'm wondering if some of that was terrorist terrorism supporting you know 

130.80 132.59 A: mhm yeah i agree 

138.59 140.44 A: (( i don't know oh no )) 

139.69 143.21 B: so 'cause they they found millions and millions of dollars 

142.85 143.93 A: really 

143.34 145.02 B: yeah in in um 

145.12 153.05 B: a kennel or something i don't know i forget where it was but they just and it i don't know if they've determined yet whether or not it's it's uh 

153.30 157.59 B: phoney money or but it's u._s. dollars you know 

156.64 159.09 A: (( [mn] well i'll bet i didn't know that )) 

157.87 161.36 B: yeah so th- i think they won't what's the word i want um 

161.44 168.48 B: when you when you make phoney mon- counterfeit you know i don't know if they [mn] i don't know why that word escapes me so 

164.25 165.28 A: (( counterfeit )) 

165.64 169.33 A: [laughter] mm [laughter] it might be i wouldn't put it 

169.44 173.91 B: [mn] yeah i know so i don't know what they're going to do with it i i 

169.46 170.30 A: (( past )) 

170.88 172.35 A: (( them [laughter] )) 

174.06 181.31 B: you know if it's real i guess then they're going to try and do some humanitarian things with it for the iraqi people which i think is yeah 

179.50 181.75 A: well they should yeah 

181.63 183.18 B: so um 

182.20 183.17 A: (( i mean i'm )) 

183.28 197.10 A: i don't know i was kinda i hated that we had to go to war but i mean you know it was something that i think we had to do and um i think our president pretty much knew i mean you know they know more than we do so you know it's not something i don't think he 

189.86 190.95 B: mhm 

195.58 205.55 B: yeah i felt like i had to put my trust in him and i was kinda glad that you know it was him i suppose as opposed to some o- other leaders i i guess you know 

204.68 216.56 A: yeah well you know you think about the past nothing's been done anyway so it's like i mean i hated that it had to follow him to do it but you know you go- you gotta do what you have to do and 

205.56 206.49 B: (( um mhm )) 

216.08 217.07 B: right 

216.69 222.18 A: we didn't know what all that was going on behind the scenes and you know just as regular 

222.20 225.60 A: the public you know [laughter] but 

223.30 235.82 B: right right you know and and you know you want it to be a deterrent to other you know 'cause now you do see people starting to be a little less cocky the other countries i notice too you know 

227.50 228.65 A: yeah 

234.66 237.00 A: oh boy yeah now 

236.59 240.08 B: yeah and sometimes it takes that it seems like 

239.64 246.90 A: i know and that irritated me so much that they just wouldn't stand behind us but it's like well okay [laughter] if you wanna [laughter] 

245.23 246.62 B: oh i know 

246.84 259.25 B: now they're crying [laughter] i don't know if they're p- pa- you know i don't know if if fr- france is paying paying it's dues or not you know s- sanction wi- well not sanction wise but economically you know 

248.82 249.72 A: (( [mn] )) 

249.91 251.74 A: [mn] yeah now they're crying [mn] 

255.17 256.00 A: oh 

258.51 259.12 A: (( mm )) 

259.21 273.91 B: but i i heard it i heard they were hurting you know i- initially they said oh this isn't gonna be this will be a drop in the bucket you know individual people not buying but now but i feel sorry for the companies that aren't french and they sound french and they're getting slammed too you know 

261.67 262.61 A: yeah 

273.57 282.62 A: oh i know i thought oh oh a- and see the other day on our news they were trying to tell us which ones were french and which ones were um 

274.31 276.56 B: [laughter] 

280.57 282.12 B: yeah 

282.69 296.12 A: you know not or the ones that were i don't know they were trying to explain and they were like don't because a lot of their stuff's made in in even in america you know and i thought well i don't know which one i hadn't boycotted anybody but 

290.66 292.05 B: right 

295.80 300.38 B: uh-huh well i don't drink i don't particular care for french wine anyway 

296.20 297.95 A: (( i know a lot of people have )) 

300.26 301.39 A: [laughter] 

300.64 311.35 B: so i don't it didn't do anything to me but now when i see it i just wrinkle up my nose you know [laughter] it's like huh see it's on sale ha ha you know [laughter] i figure it's on sale because it's not moving yeah 

304.11 306.18 A: [laughter] 

307.44 309.46 A: (( i know it's like mm sorry )) 

311.00 323.55 A: well that you know i think they'll realise that they probably you know made a big mistake but i just i don't know i'm kinda glad it's getting over with but um then in anoth- another sense i'm wondering if it is over [mn] 

319.81 321.13 B: oh me too 

322.71 324.60 B: i know i know 

324.21 330.45 A: because the people are acting so strange you know i don't know if saddam i don't know if he's gone or if he's 

325.60 327.87 B: [mn] yeah 

330.39 339.18 B: i know i felt you know and i w- wonder if we should just do what they say and get out like they ask you know but then it'll probably be another public relations nightmare 

335.51 336.34 A: [mn] 

339.25 342.89 A: well you don't want to fight if he's not if he's not there if we get out 

343.08 346.72 A: um you think he'll just come back i mean 

346.37 349.16 B: i don't know i think people will kill him first don't you 

348.68 359.03 A: i well i don't know i mean if they were so scared i mean when he was there i guess i mean you would think they would but i just i don't know i guess they just do not understand freedom at all 

349.23 350.14 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

358.70 363.68 B: i know and you know that's that is sad very sad 

359.40 361.28 A: i mean i feel sorry for 'em 

362.00 362.83 A: i know 

362.90 371.51 A: 'cause i know they were excited when it happened but now they're all upset because we're over there and it's like we're not trying to make you america [laughter] i mean we're just [mn] trying to help you 

369.19 370.45 B: mhm 

370.69 375.48 B: but that is a dirty word to a lot of these countries who've had power mongers 

372.71 373.85 A: oh 

375.12 376.63 A: i know i know 

375.66 385.72 B: i mean just like uh term limits is in this country [laughter] i hate to say it but it's like the ones who are powerful they don't want to give that up you know 

380.47 381.28 A: [laughter] 

384.86 389.08 A: uh-uh uh-uh no i understand i mean i know they have some 

385.91 387.57 B: oh so 

389.28 395.07 A: major issues but it's you know we're just i would think we're just trying to help 'em but i don't know maybe 

394.73 395.90 B: yeah 

395.29 396.14 A: (( you know )) 

396.34 399.67 A: like i said i'm not real big into politics [mn] i 

398.84 400.06 B: yeah 

399.77 401.03 A: try to keep 

400.48 402.30 B: [laughter] 

401.59 403.82 A: i just try to know what's going on a little bit 

403.73 408.54 B: well yeah and i this one's a toughy i think too because it's 

404.48 405.79 A: [laughter] 

408.55 412.66 B: it's really it's almost unprecedented in a way you know 

412.05 417.54 A: i know i know i mean i was surprised how short lived it was i mean they really 

416.03 421.82 B: oh my god thank god because i have a friend whose sister's in there but they had her signed up for two year's worth 

421.58 422.87 A: (( oh phew )) 

422.21 428.66 B: you know when she first went to iraq they said oh your term of you know deployment is two years 

428.64 437.74 B: so i thought maybe they just did that to get it over with right away as far as to make them prepare for the worst and then send 'em home in a in six months if they can 

437.58 447.79 B: that's what i kinda thought maybe they were doing it for you know i don't know but they they held her almost to the end of the war and then they took and then she went into uh kuwait 

439.89 441.35 A: well yeah 

447.76 454.11 B: but they had they first took her over in turkey and then that was you know that didn't that fell through because turkey had to
