0.49 4.99 A: hello this is yeah uh my name is nancy 

1.17 2.39 B: hello 

4.86 10.81 B: my name is cammy this is my first call so i'm not exactly sure how this is gonna go [laughter] 

10.56 24.20 A: well uh we're both new this is my first one also [laughter] so i guess we'll both uh wing [laughter] well they we're supposed to talk about the disarming of iraq and what 

13.65 15.97 B: oh no [laughter] 

17.98 19.89 B: right [laughter] 

23.98 25.64 A: we think about that 

25.98 32.05 B: yes i um well um i'm i'm for it 

26.74 28.37 A: [laughter] 

31.74 33.25 A: well i am too 

32.80 34.19 B: oh okay 

33.63 42.41 A: [laughter] so we won't have a fight so maybe [laughter] i don't know if we're supposed to argue or not but it's kinda hard when we're both on the same side i mean 

35.45 37.61 B: [laughter] 

41.67 46.12 B: right right i i think it's a very important thing i'm 

46.18 49.13 B: definitely i'm very supportive of it 

48.64 55.93 A: i am too i figure it we went this far we've lost this many lives you know let's don't quit like we did before 

55.67 58.02 B: right exactly 

57.88 58.90 A: and 

58.94 68.73 A: uh i wish you know they would find uh more of the weapons and stuff but i guess maybe he was smarter than we thought and hid 'em a little better than we thought 

68.40 76.09 B: yeah or like they had said um des- maybe destroyed them or or sent them somewhere else 

75.90 88.77 A: i seriously would doubt he would destroy 'em you know from what i've heard on the news and everything i was more inclined to think maybe they're hid you know really buried deep or they're 

88.81 92.16 A: hopefully not but he may have sent 'em to another country 

91.74 93.88 B: yeah yeah like 

94.07 101.86 B: how they're talking kinda syria might be harboring them and stuff i'm hoping they ain't got the weapons 

102.12 106.66 A: it's a strong possiblity but you know i 

106.83 116.02 A: didn't feel like sometime on the media that we don't always see or hear all that's going on and sometimes i think that's better [mn] 

115.65 117.78 B: [mn] right right 

117.62 119.86 A: because you know in this 

120.16 122.63 A: sometimes they put too much out 

122.58 124.16 B: yeah 

124.23 126.73 B: that that's definitely true 

127.01 134.47 A: and you know i'd rather not know than have too much on the news than have our boys in danger 

134.78 144.89 B: right i'm as far as putting out too much i'm i'm like during the whole war thing i was l- i was like well what if they're watching they're gonna see this they're gonna know where they're at and all this 

144.55 145.67 A: right 

146.03 150.28 A: and they're supposed to be here in this country some of 'em 

150.07 152.65 B: (( [mn] yeah definitely )) 

152.03 157.09 A: and i mean they can watch television they've got a telephone [laughter] you know 

154.55 162.58 B: [laughter] right might not be easy to get a hold of their their people over there but i'm sure they can do it if they need to 

162.43 173.95 A: well i'm i mean if they went to all the trouble they have i'm sure they've thought of things that we never would think of i hope our government is thinking of things we don't because 

174.05 177.37 A: if you're like me you're not trained in this sort of 

177.65 180.65 A: (( espionage and the all that stuff [laughter] )) 

178.70 180.61 B: yeah [laughter] 

181.23 186.24 A: i mean get smart is about as far as i know from watching [laughter] 

184.81 186.27 B: [laughter] 

187.11 191.71 A: and let's hope they're not using that technology [laughter] 

190.50 193.10 B: right exactly 

192.63 196.49 A: or maybe you're not old enough to remember get smart from television 

196.80 201.59 B: oh yeah yeah i i i remember maxwell smart [laughter] 

197.56 198.56 A: [laughter] 

200.96 201.89 A: (( right )) 

202.08 210.63 B: yes that was no if they had an agent like him sometimes yeah [laughter] he was a little clumsy and crazy 

207.23 209.11 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

209.91 213.24 A: but he was just stupid enough to pull it off [laughter] 

212.31 216.82 B: [laughter] yeah that's the thing though right [laughter] 

214.95 220.03 A: right sometimes you know uh the smartest people play dumb 

220.09 223.85 B: yeah that's defini- oh yeah that is definitely true 

223.85 226.54 A: and you know that is better than 

226.66 230.22 A: some of these that try to act like they know it all 

230.50 231.97 B: [laughter] 

230.55 233.07 A: [laughter] but 

233.71 244.62 A: uh i would like you know a little more information when they do find something you know a little more detail in something that we could understand a little better 

244.52 245.96 B: right 

245.97 248.68 B: yes i do agree with that 

248.45 249.24 A: but 

249.56 250.54 A: i 

250.66 255.17 A: don't know how you know basically they're gonna dig 'em out but 

255.76 256.92 A: that is 

255.95 268.91 B: well i remember hearing um also that they they had found like a bunch of guns and stuff like that in like carnivals and stuff so i mean schools hospitals so i mean 

269.31 278.14 B: you're right on they could just be somewhere just plain like out in the desert or something buried where no one would ever think of looking for something 

278.18 282.93 A: well you know the easiest way to hide something is to put it in plain sight 

283.25 286.98 B: right there you go definitely 

283.98 285.42 A: [laughter] that's what 

286.26 290.64 A: so i mean they might just be actually looking over it 

291.84 292.85 A: or some- 

291.98 293.78 B: that's an idea 

294.05 295.60 B: right 

295.18 305.08 A: you know it could be so plain nobody's ever thought there to look but to me to put it in the school to put the children in jeopardy is terrible 

304.88 306.90 B: yes exactly 

306.26 314.30 A: and in the hospitals you know that would be the worst fear in the world to think you know i've got a loved one in the hospital and they might bomb it 

314.68 315.51 A: but 

315.51 319.20 B: right or there's a bunch of chemical weapons in there and 

319.43 322.42 B: you know accidents happen 

322.22 323.29 A: right 

323.49 324.30 A: but 

324.31 326.89 A: those people to be honest don't seem like 

327.33 329.95 A: to their government they were that important 

329.57 331.96 B: yeah right 

331.93 333.45 A: and that's sad 

333.41 344.12 B: definitely which is why we went over there and took care of the business we needed to and which is why i totally agree with that 

343.06 344.41 A: i do too 

344.85 351.23 B: i think they maybe need to take a metal detector or some kind of sonar equipment or something and and just 

344.95 346.08 A: they 

351.35 352.44 B: i mean 

352.73 361.92 B: go looking in lakes or even i mean you know you never know their minds where how they can hide things put it in a big old bubble under the lake or something 

362.00 372.20 A: well they're supposed to have bunkers there so i think you know they should maybe be digging them out but they like i said i expect there's a lot going on we don't know 

371.46 377.36 B: right right things they're just letting the media know to let us know but 

377.43 378.94 B: just giving them 

379.58 382.72 B: certain things and not saying everything 

382.53 385.25 A: well like i said you know uh like 

385.52 391.20 A: oh i guess got his name on the end of my tongue that uh reporter they kicked out 

391.34 394.32 B: oh geraldo rivera [laughter] 

391.38 392.28 A: you know 

392.58 400.74 A: yeah that's him [laughter] i do like to hear him but you know uh i guess he was giving too much information 

400.39 412.18 B: yeah draw on maps and everything on the floor i didn't get to see it though i mean i heard about it and i've seen little previews of it but i was like i never actually watched his broadcast because i was watching um 

402.36 403.61 A: (( [laughter] )) 

412.08 416.86 B: um m._s._n._b._c. and he was for the fox network 

416.46 417.72 A: well i 

416.94 423.28 B: and after that i turned over trying to catch a glimpse you know like well i just want to see one of his reports [laughter] 

422.83 427.64 A: [mn] well you're like me i'm always on the wrong channel at the wrong time [laughter] 

425.35 429.71 B: [laughter] right that is that's definitely me 

429.53 433.63 A: uh but we can't get fox i'm in the country so we're out 

432.57 434.48 B: oh i'm in the country too 

434.04 435.22 A: oh you do 

434.88 436.05 B: [laughter] 

435.68 445.55 A: [laughter] well maybe that's reason they matched us two rural people [laughter] but uh out here you know we don't have satellite and 

439.39 440.86 B: [laughter] 

444.56 446.18 B: oh yeah 

445.74 449.10 A: and so you know our it's limited [laughter] 

450.33 454.76 A: but uh you can still catch enough on the news and a lot on the internet 

454.70 465.45 B: oh yeah the internet definitely actually i never i mean i you know watch some of the things on just like on you know the a._o._l. just you know 

465.45 471.70 B: right there what they had but i never went into it i al- i i stayed glued pretty much to the t._v. 

471.71 475.50 B: when it first happened i couldn't get away from the t._v. 

475.29 480.86 A: oh yes i was you know there wanting to see how they did uh get everything out 

480.93 481.94 A: (( but )) 

481.99 489.12 A: uh after a while you know uh every time they did anything you kinda got burned out on that 

488.83 490.36 B: yeah 

489.96 490.84 A: [laughter] 

490.61 495.96 B: yeah after yeah after so much into it yeah but 

496.06 497.45 B: i just i mean 

497.55 501.39 B: it it was weird i guess because it was the first i mean 

502.20 515.65 B: time it's ever been televised so much like that but i mean i never really i mean i watched war movies and stuff like that but never really been into it but i found myself amazed just why am i watching this so much like that 

515.85 518.81 A: well you know vietnam was on 

519.08 523.21 A: but i was too young i never paid that much attention to be honest 

524.76 526.35 B: yeah 

526.02 534.96 A: you may be younger [laughter] but you know they did have some about the vietnam war they would show the boys being carried out and everything 

534.98 538.97 B: only i what i saw of that was ever on movies i never 

539.30 544.97 B: i mean i was i was alive during then i think sixty nine [laughter] 

544.25 549.96 A: yeah you were there but you would have been too little if you were born in sixty nine [laughter] 

546.74 548.40 B: [laughter] yeah 

550.15 551.49 B: yeah 

550.38 551.10 A: (( but )) 

551.47 552.65 A: uh 

553.95 555.89 A: you know it was just kinda 

556.38 565.89 A: different i was uh saw it in high school so you saw it in high school but still never paid that much attention you know small town u._s._a. and 

565.90 569.04 A: where it went on you know for eleven years 

568.41 569.79 B: right 

569.17 575.41 A: and so we just growed up uh thinking everybody naturally went to the army and 

575.71 576.60 A: (( so )) 

576.71 578.87 A: i'm glad that part's over with 

578.40 579.68 B: [laughter] 

579.05 584.16 A: and you know i think that was a where uh like colin powell was scared 

584.32 590.55 A: of going over there or he's either extra smart to make it sound that way 

590.32 591.73 B: yeah 

591.37 599.89 A: because that lasted so long and i'm thankful that we've got you know out and starting to disarm the
