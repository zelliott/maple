7.96 10.96 B: so this is my first time doing this so 

10.67 14.12 A: i did it yesterday yesterday was my first so 

13.63 15.28 B: oh really okay 

14.25 18.55 A: yeah yeah but this is kind of an old topic don't you think 

18.18 19.38 B: yeah 

18.73 21.80 A: what we should do about iraq [laughter] 

20.66 24.07 B: yeah it's it's touchy it really is 

22.46 29.03 A: it's kinda like we have already done something haven't we [laughter] how do you feel about what we've done 

25.87 27.51 B: yeah 

28.82 30.95 B: well you know i'm torn 

30.94 31.72 A: uh-huh 

31.11 36.52 B: i understand i'm glad i'm not the president and having to make these decisions 

36.56 37.64 B: but 

38.00 42.71 B: part of me feels you can't go into another country and tell them 

42.83 45.52 B: how to run their country because we don't like it 

45.04 46.12 A: right 

46.00 51.13 B: and the other part of me says we're protecting ourselves we're being proactive 

50.58 51.60 A: right 

51.29 52.71 B: you know so 

53.20 55.56 B: hopefully nothing will happen to us 

53.28 54.07 A: that's 

55.08 58.56 A: right right well the [sigh] 

58.49 64.73 A: um kinda have the feelings that you have i don't feel like we should just go into another country but 

64.65 68.87 A: with the things that's been going on in iraq for more than a decade 

68.79 70.54 A: (( um you know )) 

70.43 82.91 A: [mn] it goes back to world war one and world war two you know the germanys and the n- you know the germans and the nazis and so forth you know what do you do do you let this tyrant continue to run the country and 

73.80 74.82 B: mhm 

76.06 77.40 B: and hitler 

82.29 83.45 B: yeah 

82.72 86.95 A: and kill people and have these mass murders and stuff you know 

87.14 98.08 A: i can't see being able you know to allow that to happen when so many of the iraqi people it appears wanted us there you know i know you see 

91.98 93.09 B: right 

96.83 100.08 B: yes a lot it seemed that way too to me 

99.52 104.60 A: mhm you see a lot especially now on t._v. about the um 

104.70 110.32 A: y- mostly iraqis who are protesting the the military being there but 

109.70 111.09 B: mhm 

110.16 122.19 A: but from what i gather from the news agencies it it's a small majority so they're just that's really what they're focusing on and making it really you know look worse than it is but 

115.75 116.71 B: right 

121.73 122.74 B: right 

122.05 130.69 A: uh judging from the number of iraqi people who have uh seeked asylum in this country 

130.30 131.33 B: uh-huh 

130.77 139.29 A: um over the past decade i mean they're they're in the millions [mn] so that tells me that you know that they 

135.82 137.28 B: wow [laughter] 

139.63 151.06 A: fled saddam hussein and his regime and and to hear 'em talk and they did a lot of interviews with a bunch of 'em some of the news media did especially fox news i don't know if you watched any of it 

141.89 142.84 B: yeah 

143.08 143.92 B: and his 

150.48 151.50 B: no 

151.17 152.27 A: um 

152.45 165.24 A: they told their stories about things that he had done and the people he had killed that that we related to them and some of that type stuff so it's really really really sad i mean what he has done 

161.22 162.10 B: right 

165.25 170.53 A: uh in that instance i feel we should h- do something because 

170.67 173.96 A: if they were in a position where they could not help themselves 

174.27 175.07 A: then 

174.40 175.56 B: right 

175.11 179.61 A: you know someone needs to help them and it's clear that you know o- 

179.93 182.82 A: all of the arab countries 

180.00 181.16 B: people can 

181.18 185.09 B: people can come to the united states because we stand for freedom 

184.83 189.10 A: right and we are the biggest superpower you know um 

187.70 188.89 B: that's yes 

189.20 190.31 A: (( at [mn] )) 

190.87 192.92 A: the all of the 

193.15 196.92 A: states over in the middle east all the countries rather uh 

197.28 198.60 A: they're [sigh] 

198.79 210.55 A: there are so many terrorists that's running rampant that it seems to be that you know they're not going to help i mean they're just i- it's practically been proven that he was uh saddam hussein was 

201.34 202.66 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

210.50 216.98 A: um connected with a lot of the terrorist groups but i i feel he was a terrorist himself 

212.99 214.04 B: sure 

216.66 217.63 B: yeah 

216.88 227.43 A: you know in his own country so i really was behind the president and the troops and i'm like you i i'm glad i wasn't the one to have to make the decision and so forth 

225.99 227.27 B: i couldn't 

227.48 231.44 A: i i- if i was put in that position 

232.18 235.46 A: i would have made the same decision the president did 

235.28 237.30 B: i think i would also 

237.00 238.01 A: um 

238.06 238.86 A: i- 

239.17 250.06 A: ju- you know judging from all he had done plus the weapons of mass destruction i feel that they're they are there or have been there and there probably are still some more 

249.79 250.69 B: yeah 

250.08 253.59 A: in fact i have a feeling i feel like maybe 

254.00 256.32 A: the u._s. has found some 

256.71 262.31 A: you know they've tested a lot and i feel like they have found some that they are not 

257.27 258.35 B: yeah 

260.84 267.63 B: yeah well they did talk about you know evidence of some things being there of weapons of mass destruction 

265.18 266.18 A: right 

267.21 268.67 A: right 

267.68 270.39 B: you know the products to be making them 

270.00 271.04 A: uh-huh 

270.45 277.50 B: but if they did find them i think they're going to use the media to their own advantage to tell us what we should know 

277.22 285.11 A: right but i- in the same token i feel like they're not telling us all yet because um 

285.13 288.49 A: they want to continue to search the rest of the country 

288.23 289.29 B: sure 

288.73 297.88 A: for them you know and they may have pressure not to and the same reason the president did not declare victory last night in his speech did you watch his speech 

289.73 290.66 B: sure 

297.95 298.93 B: no 

298.62 304.10 A: he didn't declare victory simply because by way of the geneva convention 

304.55 318.22 A: if he had declared vi- uh victory then we would no longer would have been able to search for saddam or any of his people we would not have been able to search for weapons of mass destruction and we would have had to release all the prisoners of war 

311.50 312.62 B: oh 

318.18 319.21 B: right 

318.78 322.43 A: so he's not going to declare a victory of course 

321.23 324.94 B: i did not know that that little technicality 

322.68 336.74 A: that's what they said last night uh-huh that was interesting to me um and that's why we're not gonna be claiming victory until we're com- completely finished in iraq he just simply said that the war part phase of it 

327.34 328.37 B: wow 

337.15 343.68 A: we we were victorious but we were not finished you know there was a lot still left to be done so 

338.85 339.94 B: yeah 

342.70 348.98 B: you know i wonder when are they going to call it being finished when are they going to be satisfied 

348.70 351.63 A: i feel like once they find 

351.85 360.28 A: myself once they find all the weapons of mass destruction and have gone over the country with a fine toothed comb which is what they're doing now city to city and 

359.59 360.60 B: yeah 

360.51 368.14 A: th- a lo- [sigh] from what i hear a lot of 'em have been buried so they may not ever find all of 'em but once they feel satisfied 

365.93 366.97 B: right 

368.20 376.06 A: that they have found the ones that they can find that are there even if we don't find saddam hussein or proof that he's dead or anything 

375.87 385.30 A: i feel like they might declare it a victory you know they've released thousands already released thousands of prisoners of war that they had captured 

379.05 380.06 B: right 

385.24 386.19 B: yeah 

385.59 396.03 A: uh already i know i saw after you know after we stopped bombing and stuff i saw one day where they released four hundred and another day where they released over seven hundred 

395.94 400.31 B: you know i heard the stories of uh some of the 

396.15 396.92 A: (( so )) 

400.86 403.92 B: the iraqi soldiers just they saw 

404.50 409.72 B: the armed forces soldiers and just gave up right there like they didn't even support 

407.31 409.07 A: mhm 

409.97 410.97 B: the 

411.50 413.29 B: iraq right then you know 

412.70 415.75 A: right right lots of 'em turned tail and run 

413.79 419.72 B: you know we're doing this because we're doing this because saddam says so but now you're here and i can 

419.50 420.67 A: right 

420.07 421.49 B: i can uh 

421.52 424.57 B: you know put forth my own opinion and you know 

424.36 425.51 A: right 

424.90 427.47 B: be a free person so to say 

426.25 431.76 A: absolutely yeah that i- th- in fact uh did you watch any of the war at all 

431.32 432.87 B: oh yeah 

432.22 442.06 A: i watched fox news religiously day and night if i could i don't work so i had it on all day long and would watch specially the embedded reporters i'm sorry 

434.59 435.53 B: yeah 

439.00 441.47 B: i had to be careful with the timing 

441.91 446.52 B: i had to be careful with the timing because our kids are eleven and nine 

446.03 447.58 A: right right 

446.83 454.09 B: and they can see certain things my daughter's in sixth grade and her teacher wants her to watch some of it but 

450.51 451.44 A: mhm 

453.41 454.43 A: mhm 

454.39 459.51 B: some of it's too much i think if it's hard for me to handle it she shouldn't so 

456.37 457.30 A: (( yeah )) 

457.51 458.68 A: (( right )) 

459.70 466.98 A: yeah i have a twelve year old and she didn't watch a whole lot of it she she usually watches her own thing in her room 

461.96 463.16 B: okay so 

466.59 467.84 B: yeah 

467.05 472.81 A: so and of course my husband's not that interested in uh the de- detail by detail 

472.58 478.32 A: of the end of the war you know i mean he wanted to know what was going on but to sit and watch it he didn't care a whole lot about it but 

473.68 474.71 B: yeah 

478.11 489.24 A: i watched it a lot during the day and um at night late after we would go to bed uh i'd sit up till like midnight and watch it you know see what the rest see 

480.27 481.35 B: mhm 

487.50 488.50 B: really 

489.01 496.13 A: see what's happened from the time i quit watching it about three four in the afternoon till till you know time to go to bed 

493.25 495.64 B: right well you know 

495.87 499.75 B: for the like the first week and a half two weeks i was doing that 

499.60 500.67 A: uh-huh 

499.93 509.75 B: and then it seemed to be very repetitive and i said okay when something big happens my husband's gonna know and he's gonna tell me and then we'll have the t._v. on 

503.27 504.61 A: right 

506.87 508.33 A: (( right right )) 

509.31 517.19 A: right right right but you know they um in during the couple of weeks th- of the major war 

509.80 511.05 B: about it [noise] 

517.30 519.06 A: there was um 

518.92 532.86 A: they found lots of uniforms and weapons just abandoned where the guys had just taken their uniforms off and and disappeared into the crowd back to their family the republican guard and so forth 

523.42 524.45 B: really 

532.11 533.16 B: wow 

532.76 543.62 A: they found thousands and thousands of those so uh that goes to what you were saying about you know them abandoning their positions a lot of 'em did 

541.68 542.62 B: right 

543.18 545.54 B: because it was a forced position 

545.17 546.72 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

546.55 560.61 A: yeah a lot of 'em uh the media says that a lot of 'em that was in his army was forced to be there even his upper people but his his head people he saddam hussein had killed like their parents or 

552.51 553.55 B: sure 

560.38 561.40 B: yeah 

560.61 570.49 A: their children or something to force 'em to be in the in their army and threatened to kill someone else in their family if they didn't you know that type thing 

564.68 565.76 B: right 

569.09 569.96 B: oh 

570.84 578.42 A: so um it's just been really interesting what's happened over there since you know we did start the war 

574.15 575.17 B: yeah 

578.50 579.46 B: yeah i 

578.66 591.03 A: but i i really am glad that we've done it and that it's over because i was very very nervous about going in with all the weapons of mass destruction and how many of our soldiers would be killed and so forth 

582.36 583.45 B: yeah 

584.38 585.59 B: me too 

590.39 592.55 B: yeah but it's i- all in all 

592.77 597.65 B: it's war people are gonna get hurt as tragic as it is it's war 

593.66 596.07 A: right right 

597.80 599.96 B: and that's just something that has
