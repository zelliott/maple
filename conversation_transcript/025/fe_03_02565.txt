58.29 61.55 A: it's really negative i guess maybe after 

62.14 71.08 A: after they can settle down they get the electricity and everything getting going well maybe they change you know they change their heart but right now what's confusing going on they're kind of like

84.81 86.41 B: yeah it does 

85.96 96.20 A: yeah because those troops over there they they just came off fighting mode and now they're peace keepers you know and that's kind that's kinda hard to to turn and switch like that you know 

91.46 93.30 B: right yeah 

95.86 96.93 B: yeah 

96.51 102.12 A: as soon as they see a gun you know they're ready to like they're still revved up they're ready to start shooting back

114.51 118.02 A: yeah but they should be uh they should be a little bit more thankful 

117.87 119.63 B: oh yeah 

118.71 122.82 A: 'cause the stuff they're doing in this last month they haven't been able to do like 

123.03 125.28 A: i don't know guess what how many years uh 

124.95 125.90 B: (( oh ))

132.17 133.30 B: oh i know it 

135.99 137.71 B: yeah 

136.71 140.08 A: and when they would do all that stuff and they should be more thankful i think

143.17 145.89 A: yeah yeah and spread 

144.37 145.42 B: yeah 

146.11 151.37 A: i hope this government they put in i hope it's uh it's a multi government where everybody's uh 

151.61 154.93 A: you know on on trial and people are 

155.02 156.50 A: included you know 

156.05 157.69 B: oh yeah definitely 

157.28 158.99 A: yeah so um 

159.22 163.39 A: so it won't be too much it wo- it won't be like iran i mean um afghanistan 

163.26 164.31 B: right 

163.94 165.96 A: you know 'cause that's a mess now too 

165.33 167.13 B: oh yeah it is yeah

171.58 175.61 B: you gotta take care of afghanistan and iraq at the same time [mn] 

174.91 180.23 A: yeah more so more so iraq now because everybody's focusing on that you know 

179.53 180.44 B: (( yeah of )) 

180.36 182.07 A: more so there 

181.63 187.68 B: course there is talk that uh saddam and uh bin laden are in on this together so it makes you kinda wonder 

187.47 198.91 A: yeah yeah that's what they say but uh they didn't they didn't get along at all you know they i uh the way they thought b- bin laden's more like uh what people call a good muslim 

198.82 199.72 B: oh 

199.51 204.02 A: because uh he he follows what i mean by good muslim is he follows uh 

204.58 214.20 A: he follows all the things that islam his interpretation is islam's supposed to stay whereas saddam was like you know he'd do what he'd wanna do you know he didn't really wasn't practicing 

213.90 214.98 B: right 

214.00 219.60 A: (( and like and he was a dictator and bin laden like like him doing that so i i don't know )) 

219.57 220.46 B: yeah 

220.07 228.72 A: maybe some of his uh his partners were like secret you know secret chums with bin laden but i don't think uh he was but uh 

228.28 230.41 B: maybe i guess we'll never know 

230.20 237.48 A: yeah we'll never know you know and then and then we don't know if he's alive or dead if they ever catch him then maybe he'll he'll 

232.11 233.01 B: yeah 

236.69 238.89 B: i i think saddam's alive 

238.79 244.02 A: yeah 'cause he's a tricky guy he's tricky all those tunnels and stuff going on over there 

240.47 241.97 B: yeah 

243.30 245.25 B: yeah 

244.37 251.77 A: yeah well what do you think about all that money they found over there stacks of uh billions of dollars of american currency what do you think about that

276.85 278.64 B: probably yeah 

277.91 286.13 A: it in yeah yeah the f- the first one when they robbed the bank they found uh i think it was like three million in american currency and that's 

285.01 286.13 B: oh wow 

286.09 296.23 A: when that bank got robbed and then after they were searching you know house to house looking for different things and they came up with all that money it was it was up in the millions too

296.33 299.35 A: sixty something million or might have been more than that 

299.77 309.83 A: (( yeah i guess i guess um they they had stashed it so they could go back and get it you know when they thought everything was clear they probably didn't think it was going to last as long you know with baath party ))

344.16 346.77 A: (( yeah well um )) 

346.88 357.94 A: i i just hope as time goes on you know and they get the government settled in and they get the electricity and and the water and everything gets situated uh maybe they'll change change their heart but right now they 

357.75 362.09 A: they like uh the united states are nothing you know we still don't have electricity you know
