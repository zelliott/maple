5.49 7.73 A: good where you calling from tonight 

7.41 13.19 B: um upper michi- michigan and hilton or um the upper peninsula in michigan 

12.59 19.71 A: oh cool all right well i'm in new york city um i'm not from here but that's where i am 

13.67 15.09 B: [laughter] 

16.05 17.18 B: (( oh okay )) 

19.55 20.63 B: okay 

20.25 22.60 A: so [mn] is this your first time calling 

22.46 24.56 B: this is actually my second time 

24.05 24.93 A: me too 

24.81 29.34 B: [laughter] and this is more of an interesting topic than the last one so 

25.68 26.47 A: (( cool )) 

28.98 30.82 A: wh- what was your last one 

30.59 35.83 B: um if schools benefit or if computers in the schools benefit children 

36.37 37.83 B: um so 

37.60 38.54 A: (( oh )) 

37.95 40.59 B: it was more of a hard topic this isn't 

39.83 42.21 A: gotcha well this is kind of a fun one 

41.70 43.01 B: yeah 

42.23 50.03 A: it's it's kind of crazy 'cause i don't actually have a tv [laughter] but i i mean i have [laughter] i have seen um 

45.37 47.31 B: holy [laughter] 

50.17 52.95 A: i i have watched like um 

53.15 57.44 A: [lipsmack] i've seen survivor a few times and i've watched like 

55.09 56.00 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

57.78 61.36 A: doe- does who wants to be a millionaire count as reality t._v. 

61.99 63.99 A: i'm not sure i've seen that show 

62.58 65.26 B: [sigh] i don't even know what counts anymore 

64.38 66.23 A: okay [laughter] 

65.28 69.24 B: i think everything [laughter] these days [laughter] 

66.99 76.81 A: i know it's so i i can't really figure out why it's so popular because if we if the idea of reality is t._v. is to just 

77.32 79.39 A: show real people doing 

79.41 80.14 A: (( [mn] )) 

80.42 88.14 A: just being who they are i don't see why the i mean i admit that it's interesting but i can't figure out why it's so interesting to people 

82.35 83.32 B: (( mhm i know )) 

87.16 101.88 B: well i think the whole point of t._v. was for people to like get out of their lives and get into somebody else's life and not have to worry about the day to day things and all these reality shows are just everything people do every day 

101.93 102.67 A: yeah 

102.13 103.51 B: um [sigh] 

102.84 108.27 A: i i guess it's the idea that i mean like say a sitcom kind of does that but you know those people are acting 

107.98 109.49 B: right 

108.30 120.30 A: but i guess in a reality t._v. you know that they're [mn] i i guess there's more appealing that they're not acting they're just responding how any how how they might respond themselves or something i mean i don't know 

118.90 120.67 B: yeah 

120.77 130.01 A: but i mean i admit like i've i've turned on survivor at a friend's house and just like sort of been glued to the t._v. [laughter] like the whole time like i just find myself like wow 

126.86 128.06 B: [laughter] 

130.27 133.44 A: you know team psychology and everything it's so weird 

132.83 140.84 B: well the first surv- survivor i watched because it was you know really big and i was there you know at the very last one wondering who was going to win 

140.29 141.25 A: mhm 

140.93 145.48 B: but after two three and four and i mean i 

145.76 153.95 B: i think the only reality show that i have watched lately for some strange reason is the bachelor this time and 

150.65 151.54 A: uh-huh 

154.37 161.71 B: i didn't watch it last time but i just think the the the guy who does the bachelor this time is just so intriguing 

161.39 162.52 A: really 

161.89 174.65 B: and it's just interesting 'cause he's a millionaire and you know you you wonder if you know these women they're all fighting over him and is it really because of him or i mean come on he's got millions and millions of dollars 

165.49 166.42 A: uh-huh 

174.48 184.18 A: yeah it it's interesting because when i sign on to uh a._o._l. in the mornings there's always a big headline like who got voted off [laughter] or something i'm like who are these people but it's 

174.67 175.61 B: so 

180.39 182.24 B: yeah [laughter] 

184.16 190.01 A: they they seem just on first glance like normal nice people and but i can't 

189.14 190.12 B: yeah 

190.35 199.72 A: i i kind of wonder what at least type of person would subject themselves to this so that's that's the thing that kind of irks me because it's sort of like 

194.72 196.12 B: i know 

200.06 205.09 A: they obviously know they're just going to meet some guy that they've never known and then like in a few weeks 

205.11 209.34 A: they could be married to the guy like who would want to do that 

207.08 208.24 B: i know 

209.28 212.80 B: well um um gosh the one where um 

213.05 216.11 B: america married those that couple 

215.42 217.50 A: yeah that was [laughter] unreal 

216.79 223.08 B: i mean i just i [mn] the way i feel about it is it's like i mean 

217.64 218.94 A: that was crazy 

222.99 235.60 B: and this is just my opinion it's like the sanctity of everything that is sacred to like marriages and couples and families is just being thrown out there 'cause now i mean [mn] 

229.98 231.47 A: (( yeah )) 

235.74 247.54 B: who cares i mean now you know anybody can get married and anybody can do anything and you know what are they going to do next uh they keep trying to top themselves in reality 

239.78 240.89 A: yeah 

245.14 253.60 A: yeah and i mean it seems it it seems like the government or the whoever's in charge has relieved itself of 

253.02 253.86 B: [laughter] 

253.61 261.55 A: of of ever i mean they they no longer have the right to complain about the high divorce rates because they're supporting 

259.11 259.89 B: (( yeah i )) 

261.55 268.06 A: i mean who whoever is in charge of supporting the idea that it's so casual you don't even have to choose 

262.75 263.61 B: know 

267.59 268.61 B: yep 

267.91 282.89 A: the person and it's i mean it's not like in say some other cultures have like your family chooses someone for you okay it's like at least it's partly meaningful it's not to you personally but like that i would choose someone for like you to marry [laughter] i mean like that's crazy [mn] 

274.07 275.67 B: yeah [laughter] 

276.34 277.75 B: [laughter] 

281.01 281.77 B: (( well )) 

282.74 292.94 B: well in everything i mean and you think what you know they've done the marriage they've done the what small town where you're pretending like somebody's going to get murdered it's done 

291.40 292.86 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

292.94 299.01 B: you know all these things and what are they going to do next to top themselves i mean 

296.13 297.36 A: (( good question )) 

298.36 300.86 A: like where they can go i mean 

299.63 305.94 B: yeah public executions or i mean you never it's getting scary 

300.94 303.17 A: cruise ships yeah 

305.20 309.00 A: it'll it'll pro- like i can imagine maybe um 

309.35 312.82 A: like having a show where people get to act out like not 

313.00 320.14 A: only their dream job but something that's kind of like weird and gross that you wouldn't want to do like someone who had to go be like a 

317.93 319.16 B: yeah 

320.45 335.20 A: you know a a rat exterminator in new york city and see if they can handle it for twenty four hours i just mean like something that would because it's either got to get scarier or grosser or something because that's what people love and sadly 

322.27 324.70 B: [laughter] 

330.09 331.32 B: right 

333.52 336.77 B: yep and they're not going to watch it otherwise 

335.72 339.14 A: yeah i mean it can't get like just for people or 

339.29 344.72 A: [mn] act like acting really normally which is just what life is like you come home and you do the dishes and you're 

345.25 348.01 A: you know it's it's i don't know it's weird 

347.64 359.41 B: i mean you have to be scared when like the number one reality show the osbournes is like everybody's favorite show and everybody's like oh they're they're such a wonderful family and 

357.96 359.29 A: [laughter] 

359.41 365.69 B: i mean i just i think they get along so well it's like oh my gosh [laughter] what happened 

362.30 363.85 A: [laughter] 

364.57 366.47 A: (( like what planet are you on )) 

366.14 377.77 B: [laughter] i mean if that was even just a couple of years ago people would just be freaking out and now it's just normal you know i mean hey that's just a normal family just doing their thing and 

366.70 367.78 A: [laughter] 

373.25 374.71 A: yeah 

378.07 388.24 B: i mean it's just gotten so crazy but i'm just really afraid though what they're going to come up with next 'cause they keep trying to outdo themselves 

388.41 400.33 A: maybe they'll have to go backwards like remember that movie that was called like pleasantville like it was in black and white or something like they'll have to be just so like sort of nineteen sixties like 

393.82 394.80 B: yeah 

400.03 401.51 B: [laughter] 

400.67 408.45 A: like nuclear families moms in the kitchen with the apron and [mn] like dad comes home and hello dear you know and they're going to have to just 

404.90 406.34 B: that would be nice 

406.94 408.15 B: [laughter] 

408.48 411.86 A: kill themselves i mean it would never work but who knows 

411.90 413.99 A: (( i'm just trying to be optimistic i guess )) 

413.54 417.92 B: i mean they either do they either have to go backwards or they're you know i'm thinking 

418.40 429.16 B: [mn] i'm thinking the next thing they're going to do is like public executions or something you know i mean it's just going to get really bad and people are just going to think oh you know 

422.30 423.39 A: yeah 

429.03 441.22 A: yeah 'cause the current thing is people i mean actually my friend dated the producer of survivor um what's his name mark something i don't know doesn't matter but the point is that 

429.28 430.43 B: no biggie 

436.87 437.84 B: really 

441.54 443.37 A: it you know 

444.27 454.13 A: i i [mn] seriously question and partly because of what she said the actual validity of who gets chosen say to be a survivor and who gets 

454.27 455.65 A: sort of 

455.73 463.14 A: [lipsmack] i mean it's a little bit like fixed slightly because you have to have people with certain personalities and like [mn] 

458.80 460.23 B: yeah 

463.64 468.68 A: i remember there was this one guy that was extremely lazy he never did anything 

468.69 474.72 A: he [mn] he was just kind of an asshole to everybody and i couldn't believe that he wasn't getting voted off and it was just like 

473.05 474.96 B: (( [noise] mhm [laughter] )) 

474.72 486.77 A: [mn] i kept saying this is ridiculous i mean he was i can't remember the guy's name either he was clearly putting down people every i could not figure out why the guy made it to the end of the show but it's like they needed somebody like that in there to make it interesting 

486.20 487.04 B: (( yeah )) 

486.75 496.89 A: and i i mean it it could've been true but my kind of a gut feeling is the producers were like look that guy needs to stay in so don't be voting that guy off i don't know 

494.99 495.84 B: yeah 

497.22 500.15 A: [lipsmack] but um [sigh] so i don't believe 

500.52 502.21 A: planned uh 

502.24 505.74 A: i haven't had t._v. for like six years i'm not going to get one but 

503.93 504.98 B: really 

505.29 509.86 B: that's a good thing though i'm thinking you know i have three kids and sometimes i think you know 

510.35 513.65 B: should we get rid of it 'cause it's just getting worse and worse 

512.59 519.77 A: [mn] i mean the thing is it's not like there's not good stuff on well i mean if you look at the [mn] animal channel or the 

518.93 520.07 B: yeah 

519.73 529.47 A: but the problem is that it's just plainly addicting i mean how many other things in your life could you do for like three hours at a time and not notice the time go by but t._v. 

520.15 520.99 B: yeah 

528.35 529.28 B: yeah 

529.72 535.47 A: i mean there's things that i love but that i wouldn't do them for three hours a day but t._v. oh i'll just like watch anything 

535.12 535.93 B: (( yeah )) 

535.83 540.72 A: so the the problem is when i go to a friend's house that has t._v. or 

536.21 537.75 B: [laughter] 

540.97 547.37 A: whatever i find myself just really wanting [laughter] to watch t._v. like i've [mn] definitely something 

544.10 545.07 B: yeah 

546.09 547.06 B: well 

547.08 550.33 B: um i mean they're trying to 

550.50 559.63 B: so hard to you know hook people in that it's like almost it seems like almost every show on t._v. seems to be almost the same 

559.44 562.63 A: yes [laughter] it's true they're running out of ideas 

560.61 561.56 B: i mean 

562.18 566.79 B: you can turn the channel and [laughter] there it is it's the same thing 

565.51 567.69 A: (( [mn] [laughter] i know yeah )) 

568.06 577.39 B: so it's just i don't watch i don't watch it much and definitely i don't watch the reality i mean the gross stuff i can't handle like 

577.05 579.58 A: oh yeah fear factor i've seen 

578.33 580.34 B: fear factor yeah 

579.67 583.28 A: i can't stand it when they have to eat something really gross 

582.14 583.13 B: uh-huh 

583.38 586.16 A: that just makes me want to vomit it's it's 

583.55 585.17 B: and i can't be- you know 

585.30 588.92 B: how much do they get a thousand dollars no i'm sorry 

588.16 592.45 A: it's ten thousand bucks but you know ten thousand bucks these days i don't know 

589.38 594.53 B: oh ten thousand but still [laughter] i wouldn't 

593.17 594.16 A: i mean like 

594.98 597.23 B: i there's i would not do it 

596.47 599.89 A: i mean i would do the scary stuff like doing some type
