0.37 2.19 A: hi i'm mary davis 

1.65 3.69 B: hi i'm rachel strum 

3.46 4.58 A: hi rachel 

4.32 5.60 B: (( hi how are you )) 

5.23 6.58 A: fine how are you 

6.09 7.35 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

7.12 10.47 A: we're supposed to talk about arms inspections in iraq 

10.09 11.21 B: right 

11.61 14.81 A: uh go ahead you wanna go first 

11.98 12.81 B: and 

12.88 14.23 B: okay um 

14.41 16.91 B: sure [laughter] um 

15.19 15.95 A: okay 

16.84 22.00 B: basically i mean they've already done a lot [laughter] now of damage there 

21.72 22.57 A: correct 

21.80 31.92 B: i think they should still they should have an idea about how much a- arms is there at this point but i think it's more important just to get the right people in charge there and then it wouldn't be such a concern what 

31.28 32.44 A: mhm 

32.18 33.47 B: about you [mn] 

33.32 34.37 A: um 

34.40 40.97 A: well obviously yes they've disarmed iraq already and it was a major priority for president bush 

41.06 49.69 A: um [lipsmack] i think that um i think they should do everything they can to help the country rebuild itself 

49.31 50.36 B: right 

49.73 53.39 A: and to support the people and to find out what their real needs are 

53.40 56.61 A: um i think it's important um 

57.27 71.72 A: i think it's important that they evaluate the damage done you know like into really t- not only relief for food but like the hospitals like they're trying to do and i think they should stay with the project from beginning to end the troubleshooting not only 

71.65 77.53 A: um you know to see the effects of rebuilding the city and if it um 

77.78 83.58 A: you know if i- if that if that has been succe- successfully accomplished you know to 

82.58 88.10 B: right i think they have to or we're going to be hated by every country in the world [laughter] [mn] 

85.50 91.83 A: oh yeah absolutely but they're you know the thing that they did after the um 

91.85 101.09 A: the desert storm thing where i felt like they just kind of abandoned the people and so did so did the people there and you know and i think that i hope that they learn from that mistake and not to do it again 

97.16 98.10 B: right 

100.92 112.98 A: and also more importantly to make sure that the the leadership that takes over understands about you know how we totally feel about the weapons capability and you know being totally disarmed so 

112.97 124.58 B: right i think there's already some misunderstanding there 'cause i know i've spoken to some with people who can read the middle east papers in their native languages and the people there a lot of them are already worried that the reason we went into it is oil 

116.94 117.92 A: mhm 

119.69 120.53 A: mhm 

124.82 125.89 A: right 

125.06 131.16 B: and if we don't take a real civilian effort and good samaritan effort i think that concern's just gonna grow 

130.80 133.57 A: mhm mhm exactly 

133.59 134.62 A: um 

135.50 142.24 A: yeah because you know maybe maybe the answer is just part you know selfish on our part you know and that yes we want 

142.13 144.23 A: you know access to oil and 

144.03 151.97 A: and and sure i can unde- i can understand that part too but you know i think that their new government in place should 

151.76 159.57 A: you know understand what our needs our and what their needs are and you know how to how to keep the peace in the middle east you know and totally 

157.70 158.75 B: right 

159.58 170.68 A: you know work towards you know that compromise is whatever it takes and you know and to involve the united nations so this won't happen again you know i could see it like 

170.47 178.42 A: being a a repeat in syria if we're not you know if we're not careful and they're not careful and you know a and um 

179.35 187.66 A: and i just hope we've found saddam hussein i don't know that we have i'm not sure about some of the things that i've seen on the news in the past you know [sigh] 

185.79 191.41 B: right well now i mean the main thing they're toting on the news is who they've arrested each day 

191.46 193.78 B: instead of what's really going on in the country 

193.18 200.72 A: mhm yeah and i think it would be a disservice to americans if they don't keep us posted about that or if they try to hide things that they're 

195.06 195.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

201.07 207.96 A: you know h- you know god forbid not accomplishing [laughter] [mn] and things like that so um 

204.08 205.19 B: right 

208.00 217.02 A: so what else d- do you think i know there's uh it's like you could go on talking about these things all day and go off in different directions so i don't know how focused we need to stay on 

213.87 215.01 B: right 

217.08 218.49 B: right um 

218.59 223.01 A: on the question at hand ten minutes is a long time [laughter] 

220.38 221.74 B: well i mean as far as like 

222.09 234.85 B: i know it is a really long time [laughter] [laughter] it's like um as far as i mean i think it's a weird thing too is they were happy focusing on arms inspections as far as the topic and it's kind of more of a moot point at this point 

223.09 224.49 A: [laughter] 

234.25 235.82 A: uh-huh oh yeah 

234.82 239.38 B: 'cause yeah 'cause they've already i mean they've uncovered you know they've told us 

239.56 245.86 B: in very i guess vague terms that they've uncovered you know some weapons and they've seen different labs but 

245.24 247.43 A: [mn] mhm mhm 

246.58 247.42 B: i mean 

247.54 258.09 B: it's almost like even i think there needs to be more third parties going in there because it seems like the u._s. is even being too vague about what's in there and that's what they're saying iraq was guilty of 

257.91 259.16 A: (( um uh-huh )) 

258.68 264.37 B: like i don't know if it's like i don't know if other countries that aren't involved have any idea what they're finding i 

264.26 266.04 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

265.77 273.51 B: don't know well what's happening to it like is it all going into the united states am- um ammunition homes or 

266.28 267.28 A: yeah 

267.82 268.66 A: but 

274.02 275.37 A: i'm sorry what 

274.65 281.46 B: is it and they're also really not saying what's happening to all the weapons is the u._s. just collecting it all up and bringing it back [mn] 

277.86 278.84 A: oh right 

280.69 282.21 A: mhm 

281.67 285.97 B: or are they sharing or are they leaving some do they have protection or 

285.38 292.66 A: yeah yeah right w- you know if they found something you know like biochemicals what are they doing to safeguard that they're not being 

292.72 305.05 A: sold or used by another cou- by another country you know what are th- what steps is the u._n. taking or the u._s. or a combination to to make sure that it's disposed of properly you know 

293.86 294.78 B: right 

303.81 307.04 B: right or if it's being kept somewhere that's kind of scary 'cause 

307.10 309.24 B: if it's not being [laughter] disposed of 

307.19 307.92 A: (( oh )) 

308.73 321.47 A: oh yeah you know because i think that i think that's where other countries have like oh we'll just sell these to you know unbeknown to them terrorists and then you know u- be used against them i think that's kind of naive 

315.71 316.68 B: (( right )) 

319.98 322.33 B: right then we'll be doing this in ten years again 

322.39 329.35 A: oh yeah exactly you know and then [laughter] and just through you know they're tra- 

322.41 323.92 B: [laughter] 

329.38 335.53 A: iraq's track record i think we just need to be more and more careful and i think other countries need to be careful about that too 

335.25 348.39 B: well i think they're even naively like oh yeah we arrested this person and this person but they still don't know where saddam hussein is and i mean the smartest thing he can do right now is act dead [laughter] so if you don't get everything out of there 

339.16 340.08 A: mhm 

341.97 343.16 A: (( right you know )) 

348.00 349.24 A: oh right 

348.38 351.86 B: i mean he can just who knows what's going on behind the scenes 

351.56 353.38 A: exactly you know 

352.24 354.23 B: the old iraqi regime [mn] 

353.61 360.53 A: uh-huh and i'd i'd really like to to did she interrupt us oh and i'd like to really under- you know [mn] 

357.50 358.18 B: no 

360.62 369.37 A: it's it's you know it's great that they're finding these things it's great they're helping the people but you know i'd like to hear more about like are any of these people that they have arrested like 

369.26 378.38 A: given the man up you know i mean i'd really really like to know whether his sons and himself are alive or dead you know are they truly in syria did they get out 

371.55 372.42 B: right 

377.92 384.80 B: or are these people he has so much control he could be forcing these people to turn themselves in as a big act like [mn] 

382.90 384.01 A: oh yeah 

384.07 392.90 A: right you know because i don't put anything past this j- this this individual i think he's very very dangerous and i think they need to you know 

388.65 389.63 B: right 

392.51 398.95 B: and i think the media right now has to make it like everything's going hunky dory or people would be really upset 

393.03 393.69 A: (( [mn] )) 

396.43 397.56 A: uh-huh 

398.50 399.92 A: right because i 

400.11 408.30 A: you know i could just see the man ge- you know syria's given him safe haven w- what's saying he doesn't have control of that country 

407.99 409.04 B: right 

408.39 420.02 A: you know and what saying he's not going to do it over again or he's gonna pop up somewhere you can't tell me that you know he he didn't escape somewhere and take stuff with him i mean i don't think the man's that dumb 

420.03 421.43 B: right 

420.09 424.46 A: [laughter] [laughter] so a- you know a- and it's like 

424.49 431.09 B: and there's still enough people there who are so still controlled just they've been controlled by him for uh for years they're going to do anything to save him 

430.97 436.23 A: right right i mean that's how they've been brought up as children so it's pretty ingrained and it's 

436.14 450.05 A: and it's really it's really a sa- sad case but i guess i'd like to to assume that our government give it more credit you know that wow they're really tracking him don't worry but they don't do any they don't take any steps that reinforce 

443.38 444.49 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

450.14 452.97 A: reinforce that in the media so i don't really know 

452.16 463.97 B: yeah it's kind of just scary too because i mean the whole osama bin laden thing went away for saddam and now saddam seems to his name's vanishing more and like oh we think we know where osama bin laden is now 

463.60 464.83 A: mhm 

463.95 467.51 B: like it's seems like they're constantly trying to redirect the public's focus 

467.15 473.00 A: right r- right yeah and on a yeah i agree i don't like that either [laughter] so 

471.18 472.28 B: [laughter] 

473.06 474.09 A: um 

474.42 477.56 A: w- what else can we talk about i think we've got another minute 

475.38 476.87 B: (( yeah i don't know )) 

477.08 478.39 B: oh is it 

477.78 482.98 A: yeah it i haven't been timing it but i did just look at my clock and it said two oh nine but um 

478.43 479.34 B: okay 

483.25 488.66 A: you know yeah this is kind of like the a funny question they need to revamp this one [laughter] 

487.91 490.62 B: right because it's yeah it's a little broad 

490.42 493.38 A: uh-huh yeah well m- yeah 

492.46 496.63 B: like are they talking about whether we had a right to send in inspectors at first or 

495.93 502.68 A: uh-huh or do you think that disarming iraq should be a major priority for the u._s. you know well 

500.38 501.91 B: oh yeah 

502.57 503.45 B: well it's 

503.06 505.26 A: it already is and it already was 

503.49 506.36 B: it should be a priority for somebody but 

506.09 507.21 A: uh-huh 

506.45 509.64 B: i don't know if was really it needed to be the u._s. in the beginning 

509.21 520.58 A: yeah and i have mixed feelings at first i was you know which was you know was interesting i think the man's scary and i think that they should have paid attention to him a long time ago you know we pr- 

509.89 510.87 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

519.06 521.98 B: right and they never really finished the first time so [laughter] 

521.45 530.49 A: right and if we would have maybe paid attention to that maybe we wouldn't be in this big you know this we wouldn't have gotten in this mess even though i think we've handled it just fine 

530.34 531.26 B: right 

530.41 536.80 A: you know and i i'm really proud of the troops don't get me wrong but i didn't want us to go into iraq i didn't want us to mess with it 

536.58 539.26 B: no because it's like you're opening a new can of worms if you 

538.79 540.12 A: mhm 

539.27 543.77 B: because the people you're dealing with who are on their side are who knows what they're capable of 

543.27 553.62 A: mhm because i do under the bottom line think it's it's you know that it's it's very strong religion and it's about money and power and oil and they don't feel equal 

553.64 562.18 A: you know and so i just think that they didn't address some of maybe the real the real issues of what was going on with them because i 

561.38 573.80 B: well the whole thing is just a little too much coincidence like the bush and like when clinton was in p- power all this wasn't really a problem or [laughter] a huge priority and now it came right back to being a priority so it kind of seems shady 

563.58 566.48 A: mhm 'cause yeah 'cause when they hit this 

569.64 570.91 A: mhm 

572.03 573.15 A: mhm 

573.61 584.80 A: yeah yeah you know so i you know at first i just didn't want them to you know i didn't wanna m- i didn't want 'em to mess with it not only for the people and the children there and stuff like that you know but 

574.33 575.33 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

584.92 592.24 A: because i think it can be we're heavily misconstrued when it's about you know when they wanna twist it around and focus on religion 

592.09 593.13 B: (( [noise] right )) 

592.65 599.89 A: as osama bin laden did with you know nine eleven and and how it was you know fateful to to
