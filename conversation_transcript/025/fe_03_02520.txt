108.58 121.66 B: of heavy metal music he's the guy who bit the head of the bat [laughter] and so they follow his they follow his family around and kind of it's like it was a slice into the life of this this osbourne family

116.14 117.07 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

121.57 123.15 A: oh okay 

123.24 130.97 A: um like what do your kids usually watch 'cause uh i i yeah recently like they've been talking about like who wants to be a million uh not the millionaire show but the um 

131.00 138.21 A: what's the one the batchelor one and then the one they're coming out with a new series with a woman this time and they have all masks on and stuff 

137.80 151.41 B: you know i haven't seen that one i have uh my daughter who's a freshman in college watched the one where the guy was tricking everybody i guess they thought he was rich and he wasn't rich she thought that was a hoot [laughter] 

141.80 142.68 A: uh-huh 

145.02 146.04 A: oh 

147.29 149.99 A: oh yeah yeah yeah yeah uh [mn] 

150.64 155.73 A: oh [laughter] yeah and then in the end they ended up getting some money anyway so it wasn't really 

154.88 160.64 B: yeah it wasn't quite what yeah but uh yeah to me that i thought that was just so crass 

160.27 161.83 A: (( yeah i i didn't )) 

160.71 165.81 B: i mean it showed the women to be so [laughter] materialistic 

163.98 165.55 A: [laughter] 

165.51 180.45 A: [mn] yeah i and like i think they tried to follow it up and now the next season's going to be like a woman that does it [noise] and instead of uh she has to pick a mate but like only through personality and all the bachelors have to wear masks on theirself 

180.37 181.91 B: oh 

180.57 187.92 A: so they have so now they have to like the woman has to pick in the end who uh who she wants to be with 

188.03 191.09 A: uh not like regarding looks and stuff so 

191.19 195.90 A: that's going to be like the next series i think that's coming up this uh summer i think 

195.87 205.55 B: [laughter] i'm sure i'll hear about it 'cause i [mn] i mean the middle my middle school kids it's all they talk about are these shows they're disappointed i don't watch them [laughter] 

202.12 202.88 A: oh 

203.96 206.80 A: [laughter] uh 

206.91 207.75 A: (( but )) 

206.98 215.64 B: so you don't watch very many of them i guess i don't either i i think the reason why people watch it though it's like peeking into somebody's house 

209.91 211.13 A: yeah 

215.34 229.55 A: yeah yeah i like i i guess it's sometimes like uh when they when they kind of watch when they kind of like what should they expect for some things to happen and they're like ooh maybe this spicy thing will happen up your or like this uh this thing'll pop up you know 

229.29 230.22 B: yeah 

229.43 234.09 A: kind of like unexpected events and if they do happen i think they're all planned what they do 

233.19 240.34 B: oh yeah now i just i remembered another one that my freshman watches and that's there's i guess it's on m._t._v. it's a sorority house 

234.24 235.30 A: and that 

239.99 240.88 A: uh-huh 

240.74 242.07 B: she watches that one 

242.42 245.70 B: 'cause she thinks it's hysterical it's a bunch of sorority chicks 

242.80 243.75 A: oh 

245.68 246.55 A: (( oh )) 

245.96 249.43 B: and [laughter] that's a reality t._v. show too [laughter] 

248.44 249.30 A: uh-huh 

249.71 256.97 A: oh i think like um the one i'm more familiar with would be like survivor i think and 

255.37 258.75 B: and i watched a tiny bit of that not very much 

258.14 265.88 A: yeah i i haven't watched it like i don't really watch t._v. that much i'm kind really busy uh recently these days but like last year we like 

265.79 278.12 A: um even our like i live on a i lived in the dorms last year and um they had this like floor meeting they had this floor like games thing and they played survivor on the floor kind of like uh yeah they had to like each 

275.18 277.31 B: (( oh really [laughter] )) 

277.94 283.57 A: i don't know each like each week they would have like a a con- like a like a challenge or something 

283.49 293.45 A: and then like someone would be voted off and like stuff like that and i thought was kind of stupid because they were just like copycatting and mimicking like the stupid games it's stupid like reality t._v. thing and like 

290.64 291.65 B: yeah 

293.22 306.05 A: kind of kind of hurt some of the feelings on the people on the floor of some of the people on the floor 'cause like yeah 'cause they were kind of like there wasn't really like even part of the game i didn't even play i didn't even participate because i thought it was just plain stupid so i didn't even go 

297.55 298.77 B: oh yeah 

304.90 306.42 B: well it's kind of brutal 

306.40 319.14 A: yeah so like they're they kind of made like some people kiss each other and a lot of stuff like that and some like the other college people didn't care about it that it's not a big deal but i don't know i i just think otherwise i i think it's 

319.01 322.68 A: not that not that like appropriate to do and you know 

321.83 323.54 B: (( yeah that's kind of kind of cheesy )) 

323.26 329.94 A: yeah it's kind of yeah it's kind of cheesy too it's like it's like you know like fourth grade playing like spin the yeah they played like spin the bottle and stuff too 

323.55 324.11 B: (( [mn] )) 

325.38 326.27 B: [laughter] 

329.99 331.98 B: [laughter] 

330.04 332.04 A: like to do with survivor and stuff 

332.18 333.02 A: so 

332.53 333.38 B: [laughter] 

333.29 336.67 A: i thought it was just kind of stupid and i didn't quite uh 

336.68 338.61 A: yeah participate in it 

338.70 339.78 A: (( but um )) 

340.07 341.33 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

340.29 343.93 B: but you gotta admit a lot that's that's a lot of the fun of being at college though 

343.82 347.71 A: yeah yeah yeah doing stupid things that's it 

344.34 345.57 B: do your stupid thing 

346.40 350.82 B: do it while your young 'cause when you get old you can't do 'em [laughter] 

349.53 350.94 A: (( yeah um )) 

351.23 364.97 A: yeah i kind of i kind of don't have the time it's it's not like i don't have the time i just don't i don't know i want to kind of get out of college early 'cause i don't want [mn] want to spend like my entire half of life like in college or in school you know 

364.30 365.65 B: or paying for it 

365.48 370.79 A: yeah or paying for it and i want to you know come out start coming out and get like a real job you know 

365.81 367.58 B: [laughter] 

370.77 371.68 B: yeah 

371.05 373.81 A: so like i don't really feel like 

373.93 383.35 A: i don't know just spending time too much time watching t._v. and watching pointless like programs like that but i do find them amusing sometimes 

383.20 384.61 B: [laughter] 

384.19 391.90 A: [mn] yeah um isn't there um oh have you been uh following up on [mn] american idol i think is that 

391.32 397.30 B: a little bit on the go- i i i've i um watched idol well i read the gossip groups online 

397.03 397.98 A: uh-huh 

397.46 404.75 B: people in the gossip groups have been talking about it but i haven't watched it i know my i have a married daughter and my son in law are hooked on that show 

399.62 400.49 A: (( oh )) 

403.06 403.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

404.66 408.60 A: oh yeah i don't think that one's as rigged as everything else 

408.97 411.33 A: would you would you agree there 

410.71 414.13 B: yeah now is that is that the one where they where they uh sing 

411.50 412.06 A: (( [mn] )) 

414.04 417.10 A: yeah that's the one where they all sing and then people vote in 

415.40 421.54 B: oh yeah my son in law and you phone it in yeah my son in law loves the guy from i guess he's louisiana 

418.57 419.60 A: yeah 

421.30 423.58 A: yeah yeah 

422.22 424.07 B: some guy who sings 

423.86 430.42 A: yeah and like i think that's less uh less like less fake i guess it's more real 

428.85 432.14 B: yeah well you have to have some talent supposedly 

431.84 438.14 A: yeah you have to have talent and then like it's based on people's voting from outside like in america you know 

438.09 450.08 A: so it's kind of like everyone's calling in to see who they like and who they want to be their next star and it's kind of like an election kind of whoever wants to get the most votes stays and then whoever gets the least votes gets dropped you know 

449.53 452.59 B: yeah and i've heard a lot of a lot of people talk about that one 

452.47 453.76 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

452.69 458.62 B: 'cause then they get angry whoever gets voted off [laughter] there's a whole round of discussions over that 

454.94 456.48 A: yeah and then 

457.63 472.26 A: yeah i think i think the uh i think the the fake part or like [mn] the unreal part would be like uh si- the guy simon the critic who like bashes down on people and then like makes 'em feel bad i think that's kind of bad but it's kind of funny to watch sometimes 

464.88 466.17 B: yeah 

471.23 475.96 B: i've heard a lot about him because i heard about simon and paula abdul 

472.90 473.85 A: yeah 

475.67 477.39 A: yeah paula abdul like 

476.15 479.28 B: people [laughter] talked about those i guess everybody hates simon 

479.22 480.73 A: yeah 'cause 

479.57 481.46 B: he's rude [laughter] 

480.68 488.56 A: yeah 'cause he's real rude 'cause like he just says like i don't even know how you got here you you simply stink you sound horrible i don't even know why you're on here 

484.58 486.75 B: [laughter] 

488.48 497.53 A: and like he just pretty much insults them and i think that's how they get like people to watch yeah like yeah like who like what's he going to say next and stuff like that so 

492.08 493.79 B: oh sure yeah 

496.40 499.93 B: yeah how how is everybody going to react when he insults them [laughter] 

499.18 513.43 A: yeah yeah exactly and like some some of the people like uh the singers like uh the people who they're like just like whatever you can say whatever you want i tried my best at least i'm here trying you know and like then the crowd and people in the audience like likes them for 

513.35 515.61 A: you know standing up for themselves and stuff 

515.64 516.51 A: so 

516.33 518.61 B: now is there is there a big prize in that 

518.79 521.49 B: is there are they doing this for money or for a con- or 

518.87 519.80 A: (( um )) 

520.75 535.63 A: well the win- the winner of the entire thing gets a contract to like uh to sing and they also get like uh a certain amount of money i think and then well like i guess like half of that has to go to like a recording studio making a c._d. and make a hit single and stuff like that 

529.02 530.00 B: oh 

535.67 540.77 A: but like eventually they get to be like the top singer like the last one 

540.78 549.41 A: from last season like she's starting to make more songs now 'cause she's got yeah yeah she is so she's like kind of like the new pop star you know 

541.68 542.74 B: mhm 

544.47 545.91 B: (( oh is she really )) 

550.38 550.94 A: (( [cough] )) 

550.86 552.24 B: (( interesting )) 

551.22 552.09 A: and 

552.15 553.62 A: yeah and um 

553.72 555.02 A: i think uh 

555.90 557.63 A: [lipsmack] what's it called um 

558.30 563.25 A: yeah so oh i just forgot a thought [laughter] 

560.90 566.71 B: [laughter] well it's an hour later for you guys it's almost nine o'clock [laughter] 

563.33 563.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

564.85 565.74 A: yeah 

565.85 567.94 A: (( yeah i know um )) 

568.48 570.57 A: oh i don't know but um 

570.73 579.48 A: yeah so like in the end oh oh that's what i thought um the thing with the new artists that are singing right now i think that they sound more real because like um 

579.50 587.75 A: when when they sing on stage and when they sing on the c._d. they sound kind of like the same it's kind of like you're voting on how they really sound like whereas like 

586.78 589.16 B: oh so not enhanced it's not enhanced 

588.22 591.57 A: it's not yeah like like you know how like uh when 

590.58 592.26 B: like a brittany spears 

591.88 599.95 A: yeah like they're not enhanced in the studio and then when they perform live it's totally different but like with the record i don't know i think you [mn] actually get like 

596.05 597.16 B: yeah
