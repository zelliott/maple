12.96 13.70 B: oh 

13.49 15.68 A: and how much players make 

15.53 24.31 B: oh really [laughter] yeah i had to um like say what my favorite food was and if i like eating out better than eating at home 

16.15 17.10 A: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

24.25 25.77 A: [laughter] 

24.55 26.91 B: pretty interesting [laughter] 

26.12 27.58 A: yeah no kidding 

27.60 29.76 A: well what do you think about iraq 

29.63 36.65 B: well the way they phrased the topic it it sounds like they made up the question before the war 

36.88 37.75 B: um 

37.41 38.63 A: yeah 

38.00 41.53 B: you know 'cause it seemed like what should the u._s. do and it's kind of 

40.84 45.51 A: well yeah but it also said something about disarming them you know should that be a 

46.01 48.76 A: condition of whatever yeah 

46.29 47.70 B: priority 

47.84 49.22 B: yeah that's true 

49.35 50.69 B: yeah 

50.79 55.03 B: well i don't know i i feel like um 

56.43 65.78 B: [mn] the u._s. seems to act on some things some countries and not act on different countries and some consistency would be good 

62.04 63.51 A: mhm 

65.18 66.46 A: mhm 

65.83 67.57 B: i don't know what do you think 

67.27 77.43 A: i agree and i think i don't see how we can say to iraq with a new assuming a new government gets in there that is you know not 

77.59 86.61 A: a bunch of the same lunatics that had been in there and we can't guarantee that we're gonna like every government that that if we if we have 

80.74 81.92 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

87.14 91.25 A: a demo- if we agree to a democratically elected government 

90.79 91.64 B: mhm 

91.71 94.42 A: and we don't like it that's too bad they elected 'em 

94.28 95.45 B: right 

94.96 99.73 A: um and i don't think that we can say 

100.73 102.47 A: you have to 

103.58 106.64 A: do this that or the other thing with regard to 

106.66 111.09 A: weaponry i mean they've got other enemies in that area 

110.45 111.44 B: mhm 

111.79 113.98 A: i you know we might want to 

113.89 114.93 B: mhm 

115.28 123.93 A: and who knows maybe some day somebody will dig up all this weapon of mass destruction stuff that nobody's been able to find so far 

123.32 125.71 B: [laughter] yes 

124.58 128.99 A: [laughter] and stick it on the end of something and and aim it to som- toward somebody but 

128.41 129.52 B: (( yeah )) 

129.71 131.23 A: i don't know how 

131.62 137.14 A: i i first of all i think it would be a terrible thing for for the image of the united states [lipsmack] 

136.24 137.33 B: right 

138.25 139.71 A: and uh 

140.57 145.39 A: uh you know we have we have bigger deals going on with north korea 

145.11 149.60 B: right exactly it's it's kind of a like a funny contrast looking at 

149.73 150.63 B: um 

150.88 159.41 B: iraq which hasn't been an aggressor since you know since it took over k- kuwait and hasn't been 

157.88 158.97 A: mhm 

159.54 164.97 B: making any grand claims and compare that to north korea which has been saying 

164.90 170.64 B: you know we're we're going to build up our nuclear arms and not really doing anything about that and 

167.51 168.60 A: mhm 

170.58 182.39 B: and like and if if the u._s. is using the excuse i mean 'cause some like it seems like for the war sometimes bush was saying that 

182.95 185.00 B: that it was because of 

185.27 190.74 B: the weapons of mass destruction but that wasn't really kinda pan- panning out so 

190.64 192.55 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

190.69 196.03 B: also also saying well saddam hussein is a monster but 

195.93 206.97 B: at the same time you know the u._s. government has supported and even like put into power people with incredible you know human rights violations like like in chile you know 

204.38 205.16 A: oh 

205.95 207.27 A: absolutely 

207.58 211.81 B: it just seems [laughter] like pretty sketchy grounds to me 

211.53 214.24 A: we put into power the shah of iran 

213.91 214.91 B: right 

214.94 216.51 B: yeah exactly 

216.14 217.34 A: um 

217.48 224.01 A: and yeah [mn] we seem to be very inconsistent and not only inconsistent but 

224.96 233.21 A: working in ways which which is suitable for our convenience at any particular time now i'm sure many other countries do that too i'm sure that the soviet union in its day 

233.46 239.06 A: has done much the same thing in many other places but they're not in the limelight right now and we are 

235.75 236.69 B: mhm 

238.11 245.36 B: right yeah the u- u._s. is definitely the dominating world power and it almost seems like 

245.59 254.00 B: like this war is an excuse for the the states to sort of establish 

253.96 254.90 A: mhm 

254.17 256.51 B: more power in the middle east 

255.74 256.81 A: mhm 

256.56 257.43 B: um 

257.67 258.44 B: it 

258.56 261.31 B: it just seems really uh 

262.03 270.94 A: i know i i just feel like it was concocted and i and what's what's odd about it is that that from the minute this guy took office this guy being our dear president 

270.61 271.87 B: [laughter] 

270.99 274.88 A: um from the minute this guy took office he 

275.47 280.07 A: i mean when if you first if you heard the very first speech that tommy franks gave 

279.69 280.87 B: (( mhm )) 

280.29 286.51 A: very first news briefing he said something about something being in the works for about a year 

286.29 287.22 B: (( mhm )) 

286.65 293.25 A: so this is obviously not excuse me one second do not leave here without telling me where you parked my car [noise] 

293.61 297.48 A: oh okay thank you [laughter] my secretary 

295.13 297.87 B: [laughter] that's important 

297.66 303.19 A: yeah my secretary borrowed my car to take some some stuff to her house and brought the car back and i thought uh-uh 

302.13 304.47 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

303.21 304.14 A: um 

304.61 311.80 A: [lipsmack] anyway uh you know so this thing has been the the planning of this has been going on for a year far before 

309.82 310.58 B: (( mhm )) 

312.45 319.64 A: um george bush said we've we've we're in a panic situation because they have weapons of mass destruction 

319.23 320.17 B: right 

320.18 321.38 A: um 

321.47 325.61 A: and that irritates me i mean i 

324.44 325.28 B: mhm 

325.72 326.90 A: (( i )) 

326.92 331.14 A: appreciate all of the troops who more than i can say who are over there 

330.65 331.53 B: (( mhm )) 

331.18 332.94 A: i have no problem with them 

332.42 333.28 B: mhm 

333.26 336.61 A: but i have a real problem with how this war got started 

336.15 339.23 B: yeah i agree and the 

339.24 349.64 B: um another justification for the war has always been sort of aligning saddam hussein with with al qaeda and the september eleventh attacks which 

347.60 348.53 A: mhm 

349.66 360.75 B: uh and i i just read a newspaper headline today that like that you know the u._s. has succeeded in bringing down a a friend of osama or something like that and 

360.88 365.81 B: and that like there weren't any iraqis on the 

366.01 368.60 B: um september eleventh flights 

368.51 369.30 A: no 

368.66 372.25 B: it it was all mostly saudi saudi arabians 

371.47 372.64 A: mhm 

372.17 378.86 B: and like saddam saddam hussein's government is a secularist government which is completely 

378.67 390.55 B: like uh the al qaeda is you know incredibly fundamentally religious and hates secularist governments [laughter] so [laughter] it just seems like [sigh] ah scary i mean i'm like 

384.32 385.56 A: absolutely 

390.50 398.13 B: i i i go back and forth between laughing at just how ridiculous it seems and just like 

398.60 401.99 B: being completely horrified and not knowing what to do 

401.61 408.01 A: i agree i mean i as we sit as we sit and talk i am wearing a tee shirt which has baghdad bob on it 

402.37 403.19 B: (( you )) 

407.63 408.80 B: (( know [laughter] )) 

408.72 412.55 A: which says if i can read it upside down i know inform you 

410.75 411.65 B: mhm 

412.66 419.96 A: that you are too far from reality um [laughter] i no it's 

416.34 417.50 B: [laughter] 

419.48 420.77 B: that's a good one 

420.43 424.29 A: it's um it's very scary and 

422.68 423.60 B: mhm 

424.30 429.31 A: and while he has been off making a name for himself and and and 

430.00 435.03 A: doing these vainglorious things in iraq the economy here 

432.64 433.61 B: mhm 

434.19 435.58 B: right right 

435.18 436.96 A: has gone down the tubes 

436.58 439.21 B: yeah and and 

439.99 443.84 B: yeah it's just gonna uh it's just gonna backfire on all the 

443.74 444.74 A: yeah 

444.11 450.74 B: little people here yeah i think that's totally true and you know and it deflects attention from 

450.69 462.30 B: generally his bad government and you know the questionable means by which he gained power in the first place and um stuff do you know when the next election is 

457.92 459.29 A: mhm 

462.27 465.70 A: [lipsmack] oh the next presidential two thousand four

489.79 490.73 A: so
