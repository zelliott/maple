0.32 2.38 B: uh hi i'm veronica 

2.02 5.56 A: veronica lake no 

3.45 4.42 B: (( hello )) 

5.58 9.52 A: this is eli i'm in nashville tennessee 

8.59 11.13 B: okay i'm all the way in philadelphia 

10.88 12.23 A: you're in philly 

11.66 12.97 B: yeah 

12.31 19.45 A: oh yeah i used to go to philly when i was a kid and go to german town of course it's changed i'm sure a lot 

16.58 17.49 B: oh 

18.86 23.85 B: not german town so much they've been trying to keep that historically accurate and kind of the same 

23.47 25.09 A: [noise] oh boy 

24.60 25.71 B: yeah 

25.23 29.49 A: so we're supposed to talk about iraq [noise] 

28.85 37.67 B: right and um [lipsmack] it sounds like we can just generally talk about what we think should be done at this point about the whole issue 

29.98 30.54 A: (( [mn] )) 

38.14 48.18 A: well what i think they should do actually is to uh try and set up a democratic government that is secular 

38.23 39.38 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

48.29 55.16 A: in other words in iran as you know uh the clerics run the country according to 

55.50 63.81 A: what their interpretation of the koran is which is terrible and if they allow that to happen 

58.32 59.29 B: right 

63.83 64.79 A: then 

64.84 69.97 A: they'll be in the same fix as they were before because they're nearly like dictators 

69.79 84.71 B: right um the problem with trying to do that is that it might not be successful because it's hard to go half way across the earth to people living an entirely different culture and tell them to change their culture 

84.69 87.86 B: it's like even though we know it's going to run better our way 

87.84 101.84 B: um they're in a part of the world where everybody does it a totally different way for thousands of years and it's hard for you know they're not gonna accept someone else coming over and saying hey you know now we're the boss of you and we say you should do it this way 

89.12 89.81 A: [noise] 

101.84 104.34 B: um i think it's gonna be very hard 

103.64 115.16 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] it is gonna be very hard but from what i've read and the internet and the news the president is adamant that he's gonna have a democratic government that's gonna be secular 

115.49 121.61 A: and iran used to be you know before the shah of iran went out 

121.17 122.34 B: yeah 

121.70 124.80 A: and they're gonna do it one way or the other 

124.74 125.96 B: well [mn] 

125.22 130.13 A: but it's gonna be troublesome of course because we're gonna be in there for years 

130.15 137.89 B: see do you feel that it's the job of the u- the u._s. to go all over the world and do this or would you rather see someone else do it 

135.90 136.72 A: no 

137.22 149.78 A: no it isn't and uh but since we're in there and we started this we may as well finish it because if we leave and they don't have a democratic government it's gonna be autocratic and there are gonna be dictators 

149.74 150.81 B: right 

149.79 154.59 A: but they're gonna be clerics clothing instead of army uniforms 

153.95 158.26 B: yeah at this point now that now that we're in there we really have an obligation to try to 

158.39 165.51 B: you know help the people as much as possible to get everything straightened out we can't just like leave them at this point it's n- you know we have to try to 

163.62 175.79 A: no and i don't think we should go everywhere and and straighten out because syria is nearly as bad as iraq although syria if you don't get into politics they leave you alone 

175.88 186.92 A: but they are harboring islamic jihad and uh all these people that are fighting and in in palestine in israel 

186.22 188.21 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

187.13 194.45 A: so they've gotta get rid of those people bef- because otherwise this israeli thing will never never be solved 

194.32 197.87 B: yeah i i'm not sure it ever will be solved anyway 

197.79 209.06 B: you know i think it's one of those things that they're never gon- they're they're just generations of people who are raising their kids to never be happy with the like to just the hate the other people and 

201.00 201.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

208.93 214.72 B: it's you know the government can try to force them to change or might set up some kind of 

215.18 227.21 B: detente or something but i think there there's just like a cultural hatred in there that i don't know if if it'll ever go away it's like trying to solve the racial problem in the u._s. or something there's always gonna be people who 

227.23 230.78 B: they just have like a hatred that you can't destroy yeah 

230.72 236.21 A: well the uh you see when the shah was there you know uh when he took over 

236.30 245.39 A: they were free they did what they wanted and you know until the clerics got in there and threw him out because they felt that they are too westernized 

245.71 256.15 A: in i- in iraq uh all the money will go to the clerics and and if you do something wrong if you shoplift they'll cut your arm off i mean it's 

255.11 256.22 B: right 

256.19 265.55 A: it's a culture that we don't have to allow but like i said we've lost some people in there and we're gonna lose more and we can't just leave until 

265.65 272.32 A: it becomes a a secular democracy and they'll run it themselves you know they're 

265.67 266.62 B: right 

271.22 272.14 B: yeah 

272.24 273.40 B: hopefully 

273.13 279.10 A: but it's uh who i i'm not smart enough to understand how to do it but they're gonna do it i'll tell ya 

279.15 283.03 A: because as long as bush is in power he's gonna do that 

282.53 283.86 B: well do 

283.94 292.29 B: the people like say you're just an average iraqi person on the street and you know you hated the dictatorship but 

288.86 290.55 A: yeah 

292.21 301.12 B: you're very religious um and then they come along and they say okay now the the government is going to be totally secular and um 

301.58 314.17 B: i wonder if even the people who are reasonable and and don- didn't like the dictatorship if they're gonna have uh worries about doing something that might make them feel like they're rejecting the religion or something 

314.19 327.89 A: well th- they can be taught you see the religious people can have their thing you know they they can do whatever they want and everybody can have freedom of religion i mean there they find bibles you know they used to shoot people for having 

323.61 324.55 B: yeah 

327.83 329.89 A: the old and new testament 

329.24 330.31 B: yeah 

330.05 338.25 A: and uh we can't have that um because if if we're not successful there and i figure it's gonna take ten years i may not be here by then 

337.54 338.57 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

338.64 351.13 A: uh but uh syria is uh as bad a problem in a way although the people are free there and uh as long as you don't get political they leave you alone but if you 

344.11 345.10 B: yeah 

349.98 360.97 B: well what do you so do you think that okay so if you feel that this is a good mission for us to have or whatever do you think we should go to africa where those people are like killing each other all the time and 

357.33 358.01 A: [mn] 

360.37 368.51 A: no no because uh of course africa is a whole different game but i don't think we should go anywhere and change people 

368.51 369.44 B: okay 

368.71 373.48 A: but if we don't like what they do then we don't have to trade with them 

372.83 374.15 B: right 

373.54 377.51 A: and uh you know we don't have to do anything for 'em 

376.82 378.34 B: right 

377.63 392.00 A: but uh you know there's a lot of political pressure and uh trade barriers that we can put up uh where people will go to more friendly but but like i say there's i think there's forty wars going on in the world 

391.55 392.63 B: wow 

392.33 399.91 A: and unfortunately all of them are muslim inspired not muslim but fanatic muslims 

399.30 400.82 B: yeah right 

400.06 408.58 A: who have taken their religion and made something different from it it isn't the true muslim religion those fanatics are doing 

405.12 405.83 B: right 

408.08 409.28 B: right 

408.67 416.90 A: like the taliban he was you know he was gonna do osama bin laden and afghanistan was gonna do everything according 

416.90 429.62 A: to what he felt the religion said which means women are nothing and they stay inside can't work can't teach can't do anything and the men are the bosses and they can have two three four wives 

419.35 420.67 B: right 

421.85 422.79 B: right 

425.61 426.54 B: right 

429.02 430.38 B: right 

429.78 435.17 A: so this there's a lot of brilliant people in the middle east in the in the muslim world 

434.82 435.86 B: yeah 

435.18 448.12 A: and they can't do much because uh it's against their culture but in iran if you look back when the shah was there see the women were doctors and lawyers and engineers 

439.37 440.63 B: right 

446.04 450.36 B: oh yeah it was a normal practically a normal type country yeah 

449.19 459.29 A: yeah it was nearly normal unless you did something that he didn't like he'd kill ya you know [laughter] so it was a friendly uh dictatorship i suppose 

452.14 455.51 B: [laughter] right yeah [laughter] mm 

459.26 470.86 A: but uh women were nothing in in the arab world even in the free arab world they're they're nothing but if you look in the middle east the only democracy is israel 

465.85 466.89 B: right 

467.11 468.05 B: yeah 

470.71 471.72 B: yeah 

471.60 480.57 A: and they wanna destroy them and the syrians are are have training camps for hezbollah and everything there and the it's crazy 

473.57 474.76 B: right 

480.17 481.37 B: yeah 

480.76 486.14 A: i don't understand the uh the and sending their own children as suicide bombers 

485.49 492.96 B: right see that's that's why i think this is all gonna be so hard is because it's like they're they're so so different from us that you know 

492.08 493.34 A: fanatics 

492.91 505.49 B: yeah you know it's hard to go in there and just say or to try to reason with them or do what we would normally do with other people because they're it's like they're from another planet almost they're so so different their whole way of thinking is different 

505.18 511.08 A: but still a lot of uh surveys that are made under cover and some arabs that were over there 

511.03 522.38 A: most people aren't fanatic it's just some but uh just like hitler started and he took over the whole thing and they that's the same with them and you're afraid of saying anything 'cause they'll kill ya 

514.28 515.46 B: right 

517.92 519.33 B: yeah see 

522.21 523.47 B: right 

523.34 528.80 A: so uh i don't know what it is but you know who veronica lake was
