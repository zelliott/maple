0.57 3.01 B: hi this is val 

2.92 5.02 A: hi this is dan 

4.42 5.53 B: hi dan 

5.63 6.97 B: it's nice to meet you 

6.60 10.48 A: you too i think that the the topic's a little dated don't you 

10.07 12.72 B: uh yeah kind of [laughter] 

11.10 12.38 A: [laughter] 

12.93 19.01 B: i think they're already in the process of doing some some things aren't they i haven't listened to the news lately so i'm not real sure 

19.58 22.18 A: yeah i i mean i think there's 

22.33 24.78 A: they're now looking for the weapons that they 

24.61 25.51 B: yeah 

25.17 26.68 A: originally thought they 

27.11 29.30 A: would have before the war i mean 

28.56 29.91 B: yeah 

29.55 33.20 A: uh i don't think there's really an issue of disarming them anymore 

33.00 33.98 B: right 

34.50 43.37 B: um the topic was what should the u._s. do about iraq is that what we're supposed to be talking about i mean that that's what she said right okay 

41.87 45.50 A: yeah and what sh- what should the u._s. do to disarm iraq 

44.69 49.33 B: [cough] yeah well i don't think we have to d- i don't think the united states has to do anything to disarm them 

49.11 50.58 A: not any more [laughter] 

49.95 62.70 B: no i think well i think it's important that they um find everything so that everybody can be comfortable and be be uh safe in iraq i think is a is an issue 

62.29 68.23 A: yeah i think well right now it's a question of discovering these weapons if they still exist 

68.24 80.69 A: um have they been moved to another country or are they being hidden some place and i think sooner or later that the uh some of these top level iraqi officials that they've captured 

71.55 72.41 B: uh-huh 

80.75 87.38 A: will make deals and and some of these uh chemical and biological weapons will turn up eventually 

87.07 99.69 B: eventually yeah i think so too i just wonder um like you said whether they've gone out of the country or what they the one thing that i wonder is [cough] excuse me i'm sorry is that um 

100.18 110.78 B: where i would be concerned about it is somebody else knowing where they're at and taking up um control of the country again and causing the people more problems again 

110.66 119.55 A: yeah that's why i think it's important although they you know they there's a lot of um sentiment there for uh united states to leave um 

119.74 126.77 A: i don't think we can do that until we're sure of where these weapons are and that uh none of these outside uh 

127.02 131.42 A: radical groups will come in there and try to do what happened in iran 

130.99 142.70 B: yeah exactly yeah and that that's really tough because i know some people um over there especially are worried that the united states is just gonna take over and they're not gonna have any freedom 

142.72 149.49 B: with united states taking over but i don't think that's the what the issue is with what they wanna do 

149.28 154.89 A: no not at all i mean we we certainly don't wanna occupy that country um 

153.16 154.36 B: yeah 

155.11 158.37 A: i think it would be in our interests to to have a uh 

158.44 163.14 A: healthy democracy over there since all the uh all the um 

160.20 161.38 B: yeah 

163.60 171.65 A: arab countries and uh and iran i don't think there's one democracy over there israel seems to be the only democracy in the middle east 

171.04 172.92 B: yeah they all have um 

173.11 177.94 B: [mn] they either have horrible people ruling them or they have um kings 

177.30 188.02 A: kings yeah and uh i- it seems ironic they're worried about the united states coming in there you know that their that their rights are gonna be abridged what rights did they have under saddam hussein 

178.10 179.09 B: yeah 

182.07 183.11 B: yeah 

187.57 190.91 B: exactly exactly they didn't have any they couldn't even 

188.23 189.84 A: [laughter] 

189.94 192.51 A: they had a right to support him that was it [laughter] 

191.63 201.21 B: [mn] exactly and they did a good job of it i from what i can from what i can gather from the bits and pieces that i've heard they they were really forced into doing that and doing a good job of it 

200.21 213.47 A: i i was surprised that people that were you know there's always been there's always there always has been and always will be anti war sentiment in this country and i'll you know i don't have any quarrel with that but i was surprised that people 

213.49 217.57 A: even after some of the abuses came to light continued to say 

217.44 231.34 A: you know we have no right to be there i mean did they really want us to leave that country and let a guy like saddam who's been there for twenty five years tormenting those poor people to stay in power uh it didn't make sense to me 

230.80 236.58 B: um i think that a lot of it had to do with selfishness 

236.74 243.93 B: on people's parts because they wanna know what is it what it how's it gonna affect us how's it gonna affect me living here in the united states 

244.14 246.53 B: what am i gonna have to lose 

246.64 254.11 B: to do it and i think that is a lot of what a lot of people think is what is it going to do to us 

254.51 267.04 A: well i mean and then you get into the whole debate of whether or not you think that what we did over there is will ultimately help us to avoid these uh 

254.56 256.84 B: individually me individually 

267.18 281.37 A: you know ha- avoid more terrorism and people said well you'll go over there and you know that'll that'll breed more terrorism and the other point of view was no this will you go into a big country like that and if you take it over as we did in three weeks 

269.54 270.37 B: uh-huh 

281.60 290.25 A: some of these terrorists will think twice about and more importantly some of the other countries over there may think twice about harboring and supporting these people 

290.18 291.03 B: yeah 

290.91 297.26 A: you know i just i it it's surprising to me there are a lot it's seems to me a lot of people in this country forgot about nine eleven 

297.51 301.73 B: yeah maybe so maybe so i i don't really um 

301.80 311.55 B: know that much about it unfortunately as far as i know there were a lot of anti war demonstrations and things like that but i really don't listen to the news a lot 

310.63 312.31 A: mhm 

311.41 322.18 B: so that is a that is a problem that i have that in in being connected with the things that are going on but maybe there's a lot of people that don't think that the 

322.97 329.27 B: idea of going into that going into iraq was to take care of terrorism 

329.39 332.20 B: it was more to take care of this 

329.39 335.75 A: oh yeah well you hear a lot about people thinking we were going in there to uh take their oil 

335.59 337.32 B: yeah 

336.26 350.71 A: but a- as one one commentator said if we wanted their oil it would be a lot cheaper and easier to just buy it from them you know 'cause we we could have been such a big consumer that we would probably have gotten a very good price 

344.60 345.44 B: yeah 

350.33 352.19 B: yeah huh 

352.34 365.20 B: yeah i i i just think that there's a lot of underlying things that people think are going on in there they're thinking that everybody's lying to them i mean even the people in iraq now they think that the united states is lying to them 

364.88 366.58 A: well yeah well you know we 

365.18 378.13 B: that they're gonna take over and they're not gonna have any freedom and and it's really tough and then and then things like i just i just briefly i didn't even read it but i saw where there was a de- some kind of demonstration yesterday 

367.71 369.00 A: exactly 

377.83 379.50 A: mhm over there 

378.30 388.57 B: or maybe the day after or the day before i don't remember and some civilians were killed and they're probably saying see this is what the united states is gonna do 

383.24 384.09 A: yes 

388.54 398.23 B: but yeah you have they have to understand the way that the soldiers feel what if that demonstration had turned into something that would have been an attack on them 

397.88 408.40 A: well what i mean that's the the news people that were there said that they they actually witnessed uh the bullet holes from the p- some of the people in the crowd shooting at the troops 

408.03 409.50 B: yeah 

408.85 420.20 A: you know and these are the i guess the average people in the crowd c- sort of were protesting but then you always have this group of radicals you know that it's pretty easy to sneak into the middle of a crowd and open fire 

414.44 415.28 B: yeah 

416.46 417.32 B: right 

419.91 424.33 B: and unfortunately the the innocent people that are just there 

424.40 428.71 B: trying to let off steam so to speak are the ones that end up getting killed 

428.05 429.80 A: yeah i'm sure that's what happens 

428.76 431.78 B: rather than the radical people ge- getting killed 

431.10 436.73 A: yeah they probably got away with their weapons and uh you know some of these other people were the ones who paid the price 

436.58 444.83 B: i think that i've i think the united states is going about it the right way though i heard something that they said they have to get their basic needs taken care of 

444.88 458.83 B: now they have to get their electric turned on their water turned on and all their basic needs met you know their food and water clothing shelter all of those things and then work on having the other things step by step going 

449.94 451.14 A: yeah i 

458.93 462.33 B: so i think if they just don't um 

463.01 466.81 B: what do i wanna say push it too fast if they're if they're patient 

467.11 478.81 A: yeah i i think that most of the people over there are they're so happy to be to be rid of that oppressive government that they will give us the benefit of the doubt but there's always gonna be that radical element that just says well 

472.69 473.58 B: yeah 

478.70 489.00 A: you know you're you're coming in here to colonize our country and you know we don't want any uh non non muslims in here and but i i don't think they will 

481.77 482.63 B: uh-huh 

486.09 487.05 B: right 

489.08 492.26 A: be the majority i think you know at this point 

490.19 491.26 B: yeah 

491.68 503.42 B: i don't i don't think so either it doesn't seem like it and once everything calms down a little bit more and people start to realize that they're getting benefits even thought they're free they don't really think they're getting any benefits from it 

500.61 501.59 A: mhm 

503.87 504.84 B: and when they 

503.98 512.41 A: yeah i i'm that's surprising to me because particularly you hear that they had a uh oppressed majority that were being oppressed by a minority 

511.72 512.56 B: uh-huh 

512.96 515.64 A: you know it seems to me like after all 

515.85 527.48 A: hussein took power in nineteen seventy nine so that's twenty four years right so [laughter] you would think that the twenty four years would be enough for them so say look you know anything's be- preferable to him 

519.89 520.87 B: yeah 

527.22 531.37 B: but you know what it it sounds really strange but i had 

531.36 543.80 B: it's the same it's almost the same experience i i had in my life i married a man that had three children and his wife was abusive his his um she died but she was very abusive 

538.05 538.96 A: mhm 

543.73 552.85 B: and when those children had a stable life with a mother and a father when we got married they all rebelled against a quote unquote normal life 

553.23 554.15 A: really 

553.79 556.53 B: yes they didn't like it 

557.36 565.78 B: and the doctors all said that the reason why they didn't like it was because they weren't used to it and they didn't feel secure in it 

566.30 580.23 B: they felt secure in that oppressed you know if they i mean even if they ma- if they had an accident where they spilled milk and uh this is a true experience the one girl spilled milk on the floor and i walked into the kitchen and she's standing there 

580.22 590.40 B: in a daze i mean she was just like shocked she didn't know what to do and i'm like you need to pick up the bottle of milk she was clear across the kitchen and she's like you're not going to hit me 

582.55 583.56 A: (( oh my )) 

590.85 591.76 A: (( hm [laughter] )) 

591.14 592.82 B: i'm like no 

592.88 594.60 B: why would i do that 

594.63 599.89 B: you spilled milk on the floor let's just clean it up she goes well my mum would my mum would have beat me
