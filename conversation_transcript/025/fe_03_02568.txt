0.40 2.33 A: hi my name is lesley 

1.94 4.31 B: hi i'm schmila nice to meet you 

4.20 5.53 A: nice to meet you 

5.53 8.17 B: so what do you think about what's going on in iraq 

8.56 16.12 A: well i guess the [mn] question is kind of irrelevant now since uh they've already been disarmed 

8.63 9.49 B: or what 

15.83 17.38 B: yeah right 

16.87 25.26 A: so um that that that would be my stance on that um i guess the populace really didn't have any type of 

25.54 29.34 A: uh decision or impact on what happened 

30.13 31.17 A: um 

31.27 33.00 B: you mean the people over there 

33.05 35.19 A: no the populace here 

34.73 37.05 B: yeah yeah [laughter] that's true too 

36.89 38.05 A: (( so )) 

37.12 37.86 B: (( i g- )) 

38.22 39.54 A: yeah go ahead 

39.39 43.21 B: i was going to say i think maybe it's an old question that they didn't update or something 

42.60 47.68 A: yeah that's exactly what i'm thinking because it happened um 

48.15 54.88 A: the u._n. didn't want it to happen a significant percentage of the populace here didn't want it to happen and 

54.91 58.78 A: it doesn't appear the iraqi people are too fond of it either so 

58.13 62.15 B: [noise] no not at all but they went ahead and did it anyway so 

61.12 62.22 A: right 

62.66 66.72 B: yeah it's pretty sad actually very sad in my opinion 

62.75 63.81 A: so it kind of 

65.85 74.05 A: oh [mn] and it's kind of ironic that they wanted to impose a democracy when we're allegedly a democracy and 

74.66 78.64 A: [laughter] was this a democratic decision you know i mean 

78.30 89.69 B: right well even our president didn't even come in actually as a president under our democracy so it all it started off that way and it's just kind of continued down that road so 

83.82 85.24 A: right 

88.80 90.83 A: exactly it was a 

90.89 91.80 B: [noise] 

91.18 98.66 A: dictator's d- uh decision that was essentially made by it was a dictatorial decision 

98.90 100.59 A: you know and 

101.21 106.31 A: i i don't think it was a democratic process at all in in any way 

106.22 119.41 B: yeah something that really was bothering me through the whole thing other than the fact that we actually went to war um was the media coverage of it was so incredibly slighted were you watching it much on t._v. or reading the papers 

116.21 117.23 A: mhm 

119.01 130.25 A: oh yeah mhm yeah i and well one of my favorite uh quotes is by a comedian where he talks about um a war involves two sides 

120.18 121.18 B: mhm 

129.80 132.39 B: yeah exactly who was that 

130.39 131.37 A: [laughter] 

131.85 139.33 A: [mn] you know and uh just comin- oh who was that the comedian bill hicks 

136.03 137.03 B: mhm 

137.78 138.53 B: yeah 

138.91 140.96 B: oh yeah i love him yeah 

140.32 141.85 A: you do oh g- 

141.23 143.81 B: yeah i really like bill hicks a lot yeah 

142.38 153.93 A: yeah yeah he's one of well he was one of my favorite comedians and that always made me laugh because yeah it involves two sides 

147.02 147.97 B: yeah 

154.00 168.77 B: no that's definitely true i actually heard something on n._p._r. of course they wouldn't have it on the regular news you know but n._p._r. had said something about how they had sent over about twenty or th- or thirty thousand um 

161.11 161.91 A: (( mhm )) 

168.84 175.07 B: u._s. military p- uh kids like our ki- our our american soldiers you know 

174.91 184.90 B: in um green uniforms because they had run out of the brown uniforms and of course iraq is mostly brown right and so they were basically sending 

179.09 180.29 A: mhm 

182.23 183.38 A: right 

184.73 193.29 B: troops over in green uniforms which they might as well have been sending them over in like with targets you know just like targe- like bullseyes and um 

190.11 190.72 A: (( [mn] )) 

191.77 192.74 A: right 

193.18 199.71 B: and when asked um rumsfeld just said oh well you know they can use those uniforms like 

199.50 214.26 B: near the water and in the woods which is complete b._s. because um there is not very much of that there they should be going over if they're going to send these people over anyway they should send them have enough money you know fund enough money for u- proper uniforms for them to be 

214.07 219.05 B: in um brown uniforms like they should be i mean i'm really anti war anyway 

218.43 219.69 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

218.86 225.57 B: but um that kind of that kind of stuff was not in our media at all if if people if like the common 

225.34 235.46 B: typical american was hearing that kind of stuff then i think maybe um i mean the whole country was against it anyway but they weren't publicizing that those kinds of things at all you know 

227.76 228.97 A: mhm 

231.87 232.83 A: mhm 

235.40 245.46 A: well and i i also would question uh if rumsfeld would be defending that if uh you know his children and his friend's children from their 

244.42 245.32 B: right 

245.54 250.19 A: you know uh sitwell friends and private colleges uh 

250.22 257.02 A: were forced and drafted to go over to that war i mean it was a war fought or it was a conflict 

256.91 257.86 B: right 

257.29 259.85 A: fought by the working class so 

259.51 263.42 B: mhm right so it doesn't really affect them personally at all 

260.10 260.88 A: um 

262.72 266.64 A: no so [laughter] i mean it's it's 

266.14 266.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

266.64 280.77 A: that was something i saw on the internet it was some like jokey little ar- article on on the on the onion about that oh you know george bush decides to go over there and fight and it has him you know looking like arnold schwarzenegger you know 

273.34 274.31 B: uh-huh 

278.11 278.67 B: (( [mn] )) 

280.29 282.01 B: yeah yeah 

280.79 281.77 A: i mean 

281.93 285.25 A: i think their stance would be a lot different if 

285.27 286.58 A: you know uh 

287.00 287.91 A: their 

288.21 291.11 A: st- strata of the population had a fight 

290.75 293.30 B: yeah and this is just like an old 

291.29 292.12 A: but 

293.14 299.27 B: this is just an old fight that like daddy bush never ended up you know finishing off and so 

299.11 310.94 B: um i think like the other presidents just didn't really feel like pushing it bill clinton never went that direction and so now that baby bush is in it was just like the first thing that he wanted to do and 

306.03 307.17 A: right 

310.02 315.62 A: well i mean he also wanted to divert from the economy [mn] which sucks 

313.22 326.10 B: absolutely because it's so mucked up but yeah i mean if he like i don't know what the i don't know what the numbers were i think it was like seven billion or something something really really horrible and awfully high like 

317.04 317.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

325.99 332.26 B: they spent that much money on the war and it's just like how much more are we going to spend you know 

331.30 333.45 A: right and we have the 

333.86 338.22 A: worst uh job situation since herbert hoover 

337.92 351.20 B: i know i know the economy is just so bad my boyfriend just got laid off a couple of days ago and it's just like right and left none of my friends can get jobs like i work in the mental field and the drug and alcohol and the the mental health 

338.90 339.54 A: (( [mn] )) 

342.18 343.44 A: mhm 

348.00 349.03 A: mhm 

351.05 354.21 B: all that funding has just been cut you know 

353.16 358.23 A: yes i work in that field too and i hear you so yeah 

355.46 356.61 B: (( oh do you )) 

356.64 360.11 B: yeah it's really bad it's really really awful 

360.11 363.13 A: everything's been cut yes you know 

360.23 360.88 B: (( [mn] )) 

362.02 366.65 B: yeah but i'm glad we're spending all that money to send people over and kill other people it's 

366.00 378.27 A: mhm billions of dollars billions of dollars you know and [mn] yes the whole thing is ridiculous and i don't think we were given a voice on it and it's quite sad 

368.45 369.36 B: yeah 

378.05 387.40 B: no not at all did you hear about the um the protests in san francisco they were huge and they were they got pretty violent too actually 

384.27 385.50 A: mhm 

386.38 387.05 A: (( mm )) 

387.91 395.00 A: yeah i mean all over the globe you know i mean uh my husband yeah 

392.97 396.15 B: italy every yeah everywhere mhm 

395.12 402.85 A: there's a fund in england who sent these all these pictures you know about well you know tony blair's not very popular over there 

402.73 403.75 B: yeah 

403.10 405.44 A: [laughter] to say the least 

405.19 406.15 B: yeah 

405.49 407.23 A: and i mean 

407.43 413.99 A: thousands of pounds thousands of people and most people here you know were not aware of that 

413.94 414.89 B: yeah 

414.02 418.72 A: so we don't have a democratic media we don't have a democracy here 

418.45 420.06 B: (( right not at all )) 

419.35 422.86 A: and how could we impose a democracy 

423.19 425.92 A: over there when we don't have a democracy here 

425.79 430.05 B: yeah that's true and you know like that's just 

429.90 440.79 B: i think really that's just the start of what they were saying anyway i really really highly doubt that it's it's so hypocritical as you're absolutely right if we don't even have a democracy there is that really what we're going there 

440.62 445.72 B: if we don't have a democracy here is that really what we're going there to do i i don't think so you know 

444.83 459.74 A: right and i mean it's [mn] i don't know if you read i read in the nation that uh all of the contracts the oil contracts bush said are going to be null and void after this war which france 

458.31 461.15 B: i heard it yeah i heard about that 

461.29 466.05 A: france had a lot of those contracts that's why we're so against the french 

466.04 467.17 B: right 

466.49 471.29 A: you know so that's like six hundred billion dollars worth of oil 

471.07 472.30 B: yeah 

471.65 474.84 A: that now he has complete control over 

474.59 475.82 B: yeah 

475.09 483.49 A: and even like you were saying about you know daddy bush well daddy bush was you know they asked his opinion and he was like well i'm not really 

483.58 487.31 A: sure that we should be invading iraq at this time 

487.02 488.25 B: yeah 

487.62 492.30 A: so it's pretty sad if uh daddy bush is uh 

492.56 494.19 A: talking about it 

493.86 495.91 B: i know i know 

494.50 496.15 A: in those terms 

496.05 499.61 B: i'm really curious to see whether he'll get re-elected 

499.06 507.83 A: right i i you know i mean i've been wondering about that because i'm like is this political suicide it's li- it is like his father like you were saying 

507.99 509.33 A: i mean 

509.69 514.74 A: this appears to be political suicide because his daddy was one term 

512.25 513.44 B: yeah 

514.81 516.07 B: mhm 

515.74 523.24 A: and now it appears that because i you know i don't know anybody who's saying yeah dub ya [laughter] you know 

522.52 533.09 B: [laughter] i know i know it's really sad i've already kind of decided that if by any chance he does get re-elected that i'm moving to canada because i don't think i can take it honestly 

523.35 524.16 A: [laughter] 

530.23 531.41 A: [laughter] 

533.04 543.19 B: it's it's really really bad my friend just moved to new zealand he quit his job and he said i'm going to take up snowboarding and just move to new zealand because um it's just too much it's too 

539.92 541.26 A: [laughter] 

542.35 543.50 A: uh-huh 

543.08 551.44 B: i even at the last minute i ended up not voting for nader and i voted for gore just out of the fear of george bush being elected 

549.14 550.12 A: uh-huh 

550.56 555.32 A: that's exactly what i did yes that's exactly what i did because 

551.95 553.45 B: [laughter] 

554.39 564.36 B: at the very last minute i just did it uh not that gore's such a bad guy i'd give anything to have him president right now but um but you know i just 

561.39 562.38 A: mhm 

564.70 570.59 B: [sigh] i got really scared and i was just like oh man the thought of george bush being president can't happen so 

570.32 579.03 A: well i mean yeah but i mean that's another thing about a democracy we don't live in one that's exactly what i thought in the gubernatorial race 

578.40 579.88 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

579.14 581.78 A: i just voted against someone 

581.27 583.95 B: right exactly yeah 

583.00 589.44 A: [mn] i didn't wanna see this person cut mental health services any more the republican i knew he would do it 

589.22 590.33 B: right 

589.71 592.63 A: so i've just like i'm i'm voting against 

593.08 594.46 A: you know him
