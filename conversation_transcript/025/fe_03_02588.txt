31.48 37.05 B: yeah i are you real into the whole thing that's g- the whole war that's going on 

36.89 42.03 A: well i i only because my best friend's brother's over there 

41.59 42.84 B: oh okay 

42.47 45.50 A: and so i i do keep tabs on him 

45.21 46.37 B: (( right [noise] )) 

46.34 47.42 A: um 

47.67 57.11 B: but like do you watch the news like a lot because my husband's constantly putting the news on all every time i turn around he's flipped the channel and put the news on all the time 

51.69 54.01 A: (( [laughter] )) 

56.98 66.39 A: yeah my hus- my husband has a tendency to do that also i try to not do it during the day because we have a two and a half year old 

57.40 58.18 B: so 

65.90 67.42 B: right right 

67.02 72.32 A: and frankly some of the things that they're showing on the news is just too graphic 

70.15 75.67 B: i know i couldn't believe the things that they they were showing on the t._v. 

75.77 76.90 B: i mean 

75.91 76.73 A: he's 

76.85 79.73 A: he's a very sensitive little child i mean 

80.68 85.25 A: he wasn't even a year old when the terrorists attacked 

85.03 86.25 B: right 

85.52 93.38 A: the trade centres and he said and he was crying on my lap he couldn't understand why mommy was upset 

91.36 92.51 B: (( really )) 

92.99 96.59 B: right right but you were crying probably so he was crying 

95.10 96.13 A: yeah 

96.58 99.00 A: right [laughter] 

97.20 99.39 B: oh wow 

99.15 100.65 A: (( and uh )) 

99.43 100.52 B: yeah 

101.73 112.52 A: so and when he sees somebody on t._v. crying now he'll be like mommy they boo boo and you know crying and stuff because they're crying 

105.56 106.54 B: mhm 

109.70 111.37 B: (( ah )) 

112.05 113.24 B: right 

113.05 119.75 A: and so i try not to have it on t._v. because those people are very expressive of their feelings 

119.48 121.24 B: yeah yeah 

120.02 124.43 A: [noise] you know they seem to either love you or hate you over there 

124.12 125.58 B: yeah 

124.94 128.93 A: (( those are my [laughter] concerns there's no no )) 

129.52 140.39 B: right yeah i i mean on the topic i [mn] i really don't even know i mean i i watch a little bit but i'm not really deep into 

140.28 151.00 B: i mean i i wanna know like [noise] the important things that are going on but i think they talk so much about it it's hard to filter out what you really need to know or w- or what's just talk you know 

151.06 152.46 A: exactly 

151.72 154.05 B: but um in in 

153.29 154.14 A: i mean 

154.39 155.53 B: go ahead i'm sorry 

154.47 155.55 A: one of the main 

156.12 157.10 A: go ahead [noise] [noise] 

157.17 161.31 B: oh in terms of of you know disarming iraq 

161.71 171.68 B: i i mean first they have to you know get all the head guys but it looks like they're doing that you know little by little they're getting you know the the head guys and 

171.90 175.14 B: you know i i guess the president said yesterday 

175.16 182.23 B: when he talked on the news that [noise] um i guess he was saying like [noise] combat is over pretty much but 

180.40 183.06 A: [noise] right the major combat 

182.68 183.84 B: yeah 

183.91 185.02 B: so 

185.61 197.16 B: i mean i don't know i i know he was my husband is real good at like reading in between the lines and and listening because a lot of what he said i didn't really understand because i mean i don't 

192.30 193.86 A: [laughter] 

197.19 205.52 B: he's more like in the analysis part of it so he's real good at listening to what the president's saying and then he tells me in layman's terms [laughter] 

204.79 206.82 A: right exactly 

205.31 215.74 B: but he was saying he was saying you know basically that syria's next and then iran i guess is what my husband was telling me it sounds like he's saying you know 

211.17 212.03 A: (( i )) 

215.02 220.10 A: well and and i agree with your husband totally because 

220.30 226.40 A: uh syria has stepped in and become very aggressive against the united states 

226.09 227.41 B: right 

226.89 229.40 A: with their positions with iraq 

228.95 229.91 B: right 

230.24 238.30 A: that one of the major reasons why we went into iraq was because they supposedly had weapons of mass destruction 

237.83 239.17 B: mhm 

238.87 245.06 A: and a a lot of the countries are saying well you haven't found those weapons of mass destruction 

245.07 248.93 A: now well i think that we have found a lot of 

249.55 251.61 A: uh smoking guns 

251.46 252.89 B: right right 

252.29 254.17 A: i mean why 

254.30 263.06 A: did their training bunkers have to have all this protective equipment against chemical warfare if they weren't practicing 

262.78 264.27 B: (( mhm yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

263.85 264.69 A: at a 

264.82 269.61 A: chemical warfare and they did find a place that had 

269.85 271.43 A: chemical 

271.61 273.72 A: (( residue on )) 

273.95 275.06 A: um 

275.47 278.18 A: shells bomb shells 

277.57 278.54 B: right 

278.37 282.22 A: but they didn't find any that were still loaded 

281.60 283.46 B: yeah huh 

283.67 284.68 A: so 

285.51 286.28 A: i 

285.55 287.91 B: i don't know [sigh] it's 

287.33 292.50 A: i honestly think that we that we need to do as much as we can but we're 

291.83 292.95 B: oh yeah 

294.04 299.41 A: it they were just saying on the news yesterday that or day before one of the two 

299.44 305.91 A: that they would go to protect the military installation that they had found that was iraq's 

305.96 309.15 A: and try to get it that bunker empty 

309.19 316.84 A: but they would leave with some of the materials and by the time that they would get back it had already been 

317.36 320.28 A: emptied and looted by 

320.83 323.65 A: the people that lived in that area 

323.07 324.51 B: right yes 

325.16 327.09 B: yeah they're i mean 

326.55 330.38 A: so it's going to be really you know a difficult thing 

330.78 336.90 B: yeah i don't think they're as dumb as some people think they are i think you know 

331.13 332.52 A: to try to get it done 

336.13 337.95 A: right 

337.10 338.72 B: they definitely 

338.91 341.13 B: they're more um 

341.24 349.60 B: primitive than us i guess in in the way they live and stuff but they're they're fighting to the death so you know if they're fighting to the death 

350.19 351.11 B: (( they're )) 

351.32 358.09 B: they're different than us because they're willing to sacrifice everything you know they're just fighting fighting fighting you know 

358.33 364.39 B: they they don't they don't live like we live they don't think like we think you know they're the 

364.40 371.05 B: the soldiers over there their soldiers are just so barbaric you know the way they fight 

369.71 377.86 A: well they think that if they get killed during war for a shiite that they're going to be ensured a place in 

377.72 378.99 B: (( right )) 

378.00 378.88 A: (( heaven )) 

379.19 381.15 A: you know [laughter] 

379.63 393.57 B: yeah they think they're doing a good thing they think they're going to have what what would they sing virgins when they [laughter] when they go when they when they die wherever they are they're gonna have virgins and you know it's gonna be a party you know so 

392.37 394.25 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

394.37 399.21 B: it's crazy it's it's definitely crazy i mean i was glad to hear though that
