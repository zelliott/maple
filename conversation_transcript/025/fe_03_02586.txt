0.52 1.85 B: i'm joe 

3.12 4.94 A: hi i'm sandra 

8.51 10.47 B: (( [noise] so are we free to go now )) 

10.76 13.04 A: um i don't know this is my first one 

12.60 14.38 B: mine too so 

13.91 17.39 A: [laughter] okay i guess we g- we can just start then 

19.45 21.43 A: okay you wan- you wanna start 

19.45 20.22 B: (( uh )) 

21.03 29.49 B: yeah i mean fine i guess i'm i'm kinda curious on the question as to as to disarming iraq is should it be a priority since 

21.95 22.73 A: okay 

29.37 39.59 B: if you'd asked me two months ago that's a different question than asking me today it's disarming iraq is important because it's there basically is no country [laughter] 

37.93 40.67 A: right [mn] right exactly 

39.98 49.72 B: so leaving arms behind would be a rather stupid move at least until there is a government uh of some kind in place so uh [noise] 

47.13 48.21 A: right 

48.48 49.53 A: (( right )) 

49.61 63.79 A: now do they have um i i i'm i haven't been as abreast as i was when uh the war first started um do do we have people there who are now 

63.96 66.13 A: going to set up government 

66.34 67.37 B: um 

67.30 67.88 A: (( [mn] )) 

67.83 81.15 B: yes uh general j. garner is in place um he's the the retired uh general who i believe was in the depart- part of the department of defence uh whose job is to be the interim 

71.04 72.49 A: mhm 

81.91 94.71 B: head of at least of the of uh operations so to speak in iraq and his his job will be to and they just met i think in the last couple of days they met with three hundred iraqi 

87.56 88.62 A: mhm 

94.62 95.76 A: mhm 

94.66 98.15 B: um local leaders to discuss 

98.32 107.80 B: um the steps towards setting up a government and that included um representatives across the board now they're supposed to come back in a month to meet again 

107.62 108.77 A: mhm 

108.03 112.91 B: and one of i think one of the issues was are certain groups 

112.87 123.18 B: represented prop- properly and are they um you know the right mix of people the right people and i think i think that's going to be a big issue because you've basically taken a government away 

123.18 124.18 A: right 

123.32 134.12 B: and all the people that were in power and for years are basically gone so other than the religious leaders who do you have to look to to uh 

134.84 138.72 B: that has experience or that h- has a following 

135.01 135.78 A: to 

136.18 137.90 A: exactly 

138.58 144.51 A: now do you think saddam will come back i mean i don't personally i don't think that he was killed 

144.02 145.41 B: okay well 

145.36 146.93 A: [mn] you know 

145.63 154.18 B: do i think he might come back i mean if if he is still alive then it is always a possibility and there will always be a faction 

151.79 153.37 A: yeah 

154.28 159.65 B: that will um follow him um and 

159.64 171.87 B: so it would be interesting i hadn't really thought about that as if he were to be you know not held in the criminal court and uh to um their democratic elected government for him to return 

166.89 168.27 A: mhm 

171.76 172.79 A: right 

171.80 186.05 B: um at some point i i think part of it is the war crimes and the other crimes will tie that up but to return to a democratically elected iraq would be interesting and and one of the things they threw out there was about arms inspection 

177.17 178.82 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

182.68 184.08 A: yeah 

185.83 187.07 A: mhm 

185.91 194.70 B: uh in iraq have you followed it all what's going on with the with the current arms inspection or whether the u._n. should do it or whether it should be done by the u._s. army or the military 

193.69 203.41 A: uh well i like i said i just i think that it should be done by um the u._n. personally 

201.84 202.70 B: (( okay )) 

203.36 209.78 A: um but i don't i um i don't want the u._n. to have 

211.10 222.01 A: i i wasn't when we went in the first time i didn't think that there was uh sufficient i i i thought it was done um half 

223.32 227.48 A: i don't think that it went well because i i don't you know so 

224.89 226.23 B: yeah i understand 

228.00 233.07 A: i i'd prefer that they would do it again with the assistance of 

233.69 236.38 A: i think it should be a combination actually a 

235.39 243.02 B: okay well i'll put forward to you i mean i i'm a believer in the u._n. should probably be leading it simply because of the 

236.53 237.74 A: combination [noise] [noise] 

243.51 246.89 B: uh the concern that 

246.74 258.27 B: is it the u._s. just planting evidence or are they answering their own questions you know the c- you know by finding the evidence they wanna find uh because they're in charge of it whereas the u._n. would be give a little more distance but the 

251.36 253.06 A: (( [noise] right )) 

258.15 262.79 B: the argument that the u._s. government is putting forth and it's and it's a rational one is that they have 

262.92 270.40 B: somewhere on the order of three thousand trained arms inspectors the u._n. at its peak peak had about one hundred 

266.19 267.83 A: mhm mhm 

270.48 282.56 B: uh if they were to um work together then they have to share information pass information back and forth chase down different leads they're they're pushing the coordination problem as as a major issue 

281.11 282.05 A: right 

282.51 291.43 B: um i think some of it is probably political resistance to the united nations and uh kind of a ha ha you know we're in charge now 

282.65 283.82 A: right 

291.26 293.97 A: mhm mhm [laughter] right 

291.44 293.77 B: [laughter] a little bit 

293.84 302.97 A: right yeah i think it should be collaborated with with between the two and coordinated between the two now but scheduling could be a problem coordinating those 

302.78 311.53 A: but like you know since we have been in there for so long now and have found no weapons of mass destruction 

302.93 303.73 B: yeah 

311.43 320.57 A: there it should be collaborated between the two because having the united states there that's just not that wouldn't work yeah 

314.31 315.07 B: yeah 

319.14 323.60 B: yeah and the longer the longer we go without finding them the more likely 

322.65 324.19 A: [noise] 

323.46 333.46 B: will be that anything other than a true smoking gun that's found such as an underground facility that obviously was only used for that it becomes looks more and more like 

331.88 333.09 A: mhm 

333.23 338.71 B: planted or uh adjusted uh evidence 

337.32 339.96 A: (( right right [noise] )) 

338.56 348.49 B: and and i think one of the problems that in some ways the the current administration has ignored um is talked about it's called the arab street and it really is what is the opinion 

346.68 347.60 A: mhm 

348.58 354.89 B: of the u._s. and other places based on individuals on the street who get most of their news 

355.79 367.36 B: by word of mouth by um at the mosque by public announcements and how do they how do they view the united states and will they trust anything that the u._s. says 

365.30 366.68 A: mhm 

367.38 370.86 A: right which will probably be no no 

370.79 375.31 B: no i mean you know the the it can be mitigated to some extent but 

371.39 372.35 A: yeah 

374.73 375.79 A: mhm 

375.32 380.23 B: um i think that's al- that's always a problem and some you can elect to ignore it [mn] 

380.34 382.64 B: and or you can 

380.93 381.89 A: yeah 

382.86 388.91 B: try to address it um with only minimal you know results um it's 

384.28 385.34 A: (( right [noise] )) 

389.10 393.12 B: not sure there's any easy answer or you i mean i guess you could take it on head on 

393.54 396.27 B: i guess the the smarter way would be to 

396.45 398.54 B: um try to get the 

398.86 405.17 B: the arab media to drive the the answer more more deliberately but 

403.33 404.45 A: right 

404.69 405.97 A: right that's a 

405.26 417.67 B: the the american governments have been kind of heavy handed when it comes to dealing with al gezira and dubai television and others in terms of getting the message across it doesn't seem to not a lot of trust there yet 

416.53 421.78 A: right right so i i agree with that i do agree with that 

422.20 423.37 A: [noise] so 

423.58 425.40 A: well um 

426.30 429.68 A: do you have anything else to add i guess our ten minutes are not up 

429.04 438.32 B: oh okay let's see trying to think in terms of well just in terms of of iraq it it will be interesting to see if we ever do find weapons of mass destruction w- what kind 

438.35 440.59 B: uh they are whether it's 

438.72 440.76 A: yeah i don't 

440.81 445.64 A: i don't believe that there were any and i believe this the the whole 

445.75 448.58 A: war was about the oil to begin with 

447.69 448.80 B: (( right )) 

448.79 461.28 B: i i believe there are some simply because we have evidence that iraq has used weapons of mass destruction uh in that they gassed their own people the kurds in uh nineteen ninety one and they used them against iran 

449.12 450.30 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

457.69 459.37 A: mhm 

461.19 474.74 B: however it may not have been the major problem that they were making it to be and the thing is with chemical weapons is they're easy to hide um pesticide in many ways is almost identical to 

466.54 467.78 A: (( [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

474.78 476.26 B: uh nerve gas 

476.25 477.81 A: mhm mhm 

476.76 485.10 B: [mn] so you know you know what really is it and it will take a long time before people tal- start talking um 

479.89 480.80 A: (( yeah )) 

484.12 485.34 A: (( [noise] now )) 

485.39 489.53 B: so i think we will find something but i'm not sure we'll find something uh 

485.67 486.61 A: that 

489.32 500.89 A: that right right now the weapons that uh th- that that we were supposed to be looking for uh that they used in uh you know ten years ago 

489.55 491.77 B: really big yeah really obvious 

501.21 504.03 A: were they weapons that we provided 

503.79 504.35 B: (( [noise] )) 

504.13 509.74 B: i don't believe so um let me kind of think back on the history um 

504.42 506.00 A: i mean did we not 

509.54 520.12 B: the u._s. supported iraq for the most part during the iran iraq war however the u._s. has signed a a worldwide treaty years ago 

519.95 521.92 B: i wanna say it was in the seventies 

520.08 521.65 A: mhm 

521.70 535.46 B: that banned the u- yeah well actually it was richard nixon i think i'm almost positive who signed this that banned the use of chemical weapons by by the u._s. military and basically anyone who signed that said they would not use chemical 

531.44 532.58 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

535.30 540.29 B: weapons i don't think biolog- i don't know if biological was on the list at the time so 

540.14 550.71 B: the u._s. after the seventies or after the early seventies did not produce any more chemical weapons uh and so it would be unlikely that we would have provided them much knowledge 

550.71 559.41 B: they probably got any knowledge that they gained from the soviets because during that time they had soviet tanks during that time they were 

554.93 555.92 A: okay 

557.58 558.53 A: uh-huh 

559.83 570.57 B: as most of the countries at that time in the s- in the seventies most of the arab nations were getting their tanks fr- seventies and eighties getting their tanks from the soviets all their equipment from the soviets 

568.95 570.07 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

570.53 577.50 B: the u._s. would get involved when especially when it was one against the other uh even though iran's not i don't think an arab nation but um 

577.57 588.18 B: you know it would be they would get involved on um u._s. would get involved on the other side because the friend of my enemy is my friend uh and obviously dating from the 

584.46 586.25 A: mhm mhm 

588.28 594.69 B: what's uh late seventies the iran was um on our uh our hit list 

591.21 592.42 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

594.95 598.43 B: so it would be difficult you know 

598.55 599.95 B: i doubt we provided them
