15.51 21.72 A: okay right well me neither so uh you know i don't know what do you think of uh yeah right 

18.35 20.50 B: arms control in iraq 

21.11 33.23 B: okay um well i think that um basically that we uh are not doing anything to help uh you know control anything in iraq now where they're killing everyone um 

33.28 39.70 B: i'm totally confused with the whole deal i don't think they even had any arms i think they were the government was full of shit 

39.33 42.22 A: (( [noise] okay right [noise] um )) 

39.78 40.84 B: [laughter] 

43.13 54.22 A: yeah well i don't know i i mean i think they might have had some stuff but i i don't think it's any more secure now than it was before that much i would agree with you with 

54.25 55.51 A: but um 

56.43 62.32 A: i don't know i guess the other part of it is what they should be doing now or something like that [noise] uh well uh 

60.99 63.07 B: um what they should be doing now 

62.92 65.49 A: (( yeah i mean i don't know what do you think about that )) 

63.95 71.19 B: um well the way i what they should be doing now um i guess is i think that they should go in and 

71.17 79.29 B: do like a martial law type of thing and remove all of the guns because they don't know who is fighting and who isn't fighting right now in iraq 

72.95 75.15 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

76.83 77.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

77.75 80.75 A: mhm 

80.23 84.60 B: and it's not helping killing off you know the people that live there 

85.57 87.41 A: yeah 

86.62 93.55 B: and that's what they're doing right now is they're killing people um in iraq you know that are protesting the americans being there 

93.49 102.23 A: right well i don't know so if they do martial law i'm going to be devil's advocate for a minute if they do martial martial law wouldn't that i mean do you think that might uh 

94.45 95.58 B: (( and you know )) 

102.76 106.92 A: make people even more upset about the u._s. being there and everything 

106.27 114.54 B: well i don't know i mean it seems i mean th- they're they're killing the iraqis you know on a daily basis that are protesting anyway 

114.70 115.70 A: (( right [noise] )) 

115.56 117.97 B: you know i mean [laughter] 

117.95 132.20 B: you know i mean at least there wouldn't be people getting killed you know i mean at least there'd be some type of form of rules um but i don't think that the iraqis should have arms at all i think that we should completely take over uh the country 

133.20 137.69 B: you know until they can get it together and we can get saddam hussein out of order 

133.45 135.42 A: (( okay right )) 

137.82 143.25 A: right [noise] yeah i know i i remember before bush said he he wasn't gonna 

143.30 145.24 A: you know like during his um 

145.33 152.06 A: campaign and everything he said he wasn't gonna get involved in like rebuilding countries and uh 

152.43 164.63 A: doing all this stuff but now he's in there and it's like he's facing exactly what he said he was wasn't going to get involved with and you know he's trying to have it both ways as far as like he doesn't want to get involved but then he he 

164.55 167.74 A: you know creates some huge situation he has to do something you know what i mean 

167.47 169.23 B: yeah absolutely 

170.36 171.27 B: um 

171.93 175.54 B: mm [laughter] let's see 

171.99 173.70 A: yeah um 

174.97 178.61 A: well i don't know okay right so they're there so you think they should uh 

179.62 193.14 B: if we're going to do something or we're gonna be there let's do something and you know i mean let's go over there and let's take all the arms you know and then see what they're gonna do then there's not gonna be a threat there's not gonna be a you know any 

180.00 181.75 A: when you say martial law 

182.98 184.04 A: right 

192.97 197.44 B: problem and who cares if they protest against americans because they can't kill the americans 

197.21 199.07 A: (( mhm right )) 

198.47 206.85 B: you know i mean isn't i mean why why we allow protesting in our country i mean why is it such a big deal to go off and kill them over there for doing the same thing 

208.14 210.04 B: you know for equal rights 

208.88 209.96 A: yeah right 

210.32 212.34 B: i mean they feel invaded 

212.45 217.06 B: but you know i think that we should take the rest of their shit [laughter] 

215.82 218.11 A: [laughter] 

217.44 220.24 B: let's take it all we've taken everything else 

221.39 225.99 A: yeah i mean i guess you could say also that like people in other countries might get um 

226.57 231.08 A: upset by what's going on in iraq you know what i mean so 

229.17 231.59 B: i i think so absolutely 

231.21 245.78 A: so like i guess what i'm saying even if you are successful in like shutting down iraqis totally like if you're too severe about it you know what i mean like then you just get people in in neighboring countries more upset whereas if you try and be 

246.65 250.48 A: you know what i mean like a little more a little softer about it or whatever 

248.24 249.28 B: yeah 

250.79 262.86 B: well they did that with afghanistan you know and now they're doing it with iraq and you know they never got osama and they don't have uh what's his name saddam hussein and that was the whole point of all these wars 

250.85 252.50 A: maybe they won't get 

262.85 264.17 A: right 

263.56 270.04 B: i mean what did we accomplish except killing people and destroying things and more money out of our budget 

270.25 275.39 A: yeah and you know i mean do you feel like we're any safer from terrorism here i mean 

274.53 276.93 B: no i feel we're worse fixed 

275.43 280.68 A: yeah i don't see why you would yeah right we probably are worse where do you live anyway 

280.42 282.45 B: studio city california 

282.93 285.10 A: (( studio city okay right i know where that is )) 

285.37 286.67 A: um 

287.35 291.28 A: yeah so you know you live some place where 

292.16 296.86 A: there's some threat of terrorism or whatever i don't know doesn't feel any safer uh 

294.15 296.30 B: oh absolutely 

297.72 304.14 B: i don't feel safer but you know um but i guess we're supposed to stick on this arms thing um [laughter] or 

299.23 300.04 A: right 

303.67 306.92 A: oh yeah right okay so um well jeez i don't know 

305.19 306.52 B: we don't get paid 

307.32 311.95 A: i mean arms inspection you know i think i heard some kind of controversy about um 

312.35 321.18 A: the u._n. wanted to go back in there at this point and like you know send those inspectors back in so they can try and come up with 

321.31 325.46 A: to basically see if iraq had any nuclear weapons or whatever it was 

325.09 336.91 B: yes they've never even found anything that i'm aware of i mean they they keep on saying you know hoping you know to make us like feel okay with the wars thing we found things but they haven't found anything 

326.17 327.16 A: so i 

335.90 336.76 A: right 

337.17 338.44 A: well so 

337.24 340.97 B: and that was the whole deal of us being there is they thought they were going to blow us up 

341.00 342.42 A: right 

342.95 349.37 A: i mean so do you think the u._n. should uh do those inspections or do you think like okay 

345.46 348.09 B: i think the u._n. should go in and take everything 

348.23 353.69 B: i don't think they should have a gun i don't think they should have anything at all unless they have a 

350.66 352.47 A: right [noise] 

354.07 360.47 B: police force that is ran by the u._n. to stop looting and all of that 

359.83 365.55 A: right but should the u._n. do it or should the or can we the u._s. just do it take care of it yeah right 

363.13 371.75 B: i think the u._s. needs to get out of it and i think we should stay united and the u._n. should be handling everything i don't think i think the u._s. way stepped over the line 

371.78 373.65 A: right 

372.77 373.78 B: [laughter] 

373.91 381.26 A: uh yeah you know i i agree with you i think i don't feel i don't sorry oh you don't think we had a right is that what you said 

373.92 375.07 B: completely 

376.55 378.17 B: i don't feel we had a right 

380.60 389.74 B: uh-uh i mean you know those people as soon as saddam hussein got out of power they bashed their heads with rocks you know i mean oh saddam wouldn't allow that i wonder why 

387.78 388.81 A: [laughter] 

390.26 396.51 B: you know they they covered themselves with blood and bashed little babies and boys' heads with rocks you know i mean come on 

396.54 397.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

396.79 403.59 B: they're disturbed they shouldn't have guns and they shouldn't have chemical weapons if they're that crazy i mean they're like you know brutal 

397.95 399.55 A: [laughter] 

400.60 401.73 A: right 

403.79 405.26 B: savage [laughter] 

405.45 407.13 A: yeah well you know 

407.83 411.82 A: [noise] i don't know about that but i mean we had it's not like we're so great with our 

408.99 410.19 B: [laughter] 

412.05 417.57 A: [noise] weapons i mean we we feel free to use our weapons whenever we want right 

416.66 425.39 B: yeah that is true but you know what they're doing is they're they're um they're not doing the right thing they think they're doing the right thing but they aren't 

419.86 420.91 A: (( so [noise] )) 

424.70 425.70 A: right 

426.09 430.95 B: so they shouldn't be allowed to have control to use things of mass destruction 

429.37 434.63 A: (( right )) 

431.26 433.80 B: um if they're going to be doing the wrong thing with them 

434.47 436.28 B: they're not using it as protection 

434.80 441.06 A: [noise] [noise] yeah right so what you'd trust the u._n. to do all that stuff or 

437.28 438.86 B: they're using it as a threat 

440.51 444.31 B: well yeah because the u._n. is all of our nations combined 

441.49 443.33 A: arms inspection and everything 

444.25 445.93 A: (( right [noise] )) 

445.16 448.39 B: the u._n. didn't even support half the stuff that we did 

448.41 451.25 B: we went against them after all the years of getting it 

449.98 450.94 A: right 

451.17 452.65 A: (( [noise] right )) 

451.93 456.74 B: [laughter] but the iraq arms deal um 

457.33 462.38 B: uh you know they've been saying they're going to disarm for so long and um 

462.43 467.13 B: i don't see anything happening you know i mean i don't even think they really have all those arms 

467.04 468.41 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

468.64 476.37 A: yeah i mean i think they had some stuff that they weren't supposed to have but i don't think it was like really as severe as 

476.87 481.39 A: as what the u._s. government was trying to tell everyone you know what i mean like i think they 

481.66 489.68 A: they had a couple of little things or whatever but it wasn't like you know it's not like they found nuclear bombs or anything like that that was my understanding anyway 

489.03 493.53 B: yeah well that's that was that was what they were trying to make us believe when they went over there 

492.65 494.35 A: right right 

493.56 496.98 B: like that there was even worse than nuclear it was like you know um 

496.43 498.88 A: yeah right chemical weapons or whatever 

498.89 507.42 B: but i don't think chemical weapons should be allowed anywhere i think the u._n. should completely make everybody destroy every bit of chemical warfare that there is in the world 

499.15 499.83 A: (( [noise] )) 

507.13 508.16 A: right 

507.55 509.49 B: not only in iraq 

509.88 516.29 B: i don't think chemical you know we have enough things with all the disease and stuff i mean how do we know sars isn't a chemical weapon 

516.30 518.91 A: [noise] [noise] right no we don't [noise] 

516.93 517.93 B: [laughter] 

518.94 526.12 B: you know so i mean i i think that they you know they need to concentrate more on the chemical than the arms 

525.97 527.25 A: mhm 

526.53 529.30 B: because the chemical thing seems to be what they have knowledge in 

530.59 544.27 A: yeah you know i don't see them doing that though because then the u._s. has to give up its stuff that's the problem with any of this you know it's all like the u._s. wants everyone else to [noise] give up all their weapons but [noise] it comes to the u._s. giving up their weapons all of a sudden it's like it's 

536.30 537.19 B: yeah 

540.69 541.84 B: that's true 

544.74 546.85 B: yeah that is that is for sure true 

545.23 546.01 A: [noise] 

546.95 547.68 B: (( mm )) 

548.99 550.28 A: so um 

550.45 553.47 A: i don't know what else is there to say about arms inspections 

552.88 556.79 B: i don't either um i think that uh that um [noise] 

555.94 564.73 A: right okay so you know what for your uh let me ask you something i asked this to a couple of my friends like [noise] on a one to ten scale if you if like you're 

564.68 571.22 A: being totally anti war would be like a one or whatever being totally pro war would be a ten how would you uh 

568.17 568.99 B: uh-huh 

571.69 573.40 A: [noise] place yourself on that scale 

573.07 574.11 B: five 

574.46 575.65 A: really okay 

575.92 577.15 A: it sounded to me 

575.96 583.18 B: i'm not for the war and i'm not really against the war i see that it was somewhat necessary but i believe that it's propaganda 

583.52 591.40 B: i believe that you know this whole deal with the arms thing is propaganda and it's just another way to kind of put us in a recession 

586.66 587.66 A: mhm 

591.67 593.93 B: and um create havoc 

594.05 594.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

594.84 597.13 A: well wait why would they wanna put every 

596.21 599.89 B: they want something always going on they want us to focus on something all the time 

598.40 599.51 A: oh right
