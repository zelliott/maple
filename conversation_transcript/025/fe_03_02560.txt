27.03 30.26 B: yeah it's a little late now [laughter]

65.87 68.98 A: our world we know as north east is a little jaded 

68.41 70.14 B: i guess we are 

68.78 83.56 A: but when this comes to this i spoke to another southern lady about the iraq conflict and they have a total totally different view and i'm very patriotic i love my country but i think we did the wrong thing here i think we needed to go there but we went for the wrong reasons 

83.01 84.19 B: right i 

83.36 84.74 A: (( and um )) 

84.40 97.64 B: it it we didn't need to necessarily get there right now but it it probably something that was gonna be necessary and um you know we went and so we did it and it it was very quick which is good it was still a lot of money 

87.09 88.85 A: mhm mhm 

90.68 92.67 A: mhm and and 

94.97 96.77 A: mhm mhm 

96.98 104.41 A: mhm see i don't know what our policy i didn't mean to cut you off what our policy's gonna be 'cause they haven't found any mass weapons of mass destruction 

97.90 98.84 B: and 

104.09 109.64 B: well guess what if if they weren't there when when when we when we got there they're there by now 

104.69 106.15 A: that's just crazy 

109.13 111.51 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

109.90 113.43 B: [laughter] that's so i'm very jaded about the whole thing 

112.52 118.02 A: mhm so you know most people are taking this how do we um say i don't know conspiracy theory 

117.79 130.68 A: there really wasn't any to begin with i didn't really believe he he had 'em i don't think they that a sophisticated country as ah say korea who we really should be worried about 'cause i think they may sneak in the back door on us 

127.40 128.72 B: (( well it )) 

130.40 141.09 B: well they definitely they have weapons already and um i read like intrigue novels and stuff like that so that's you know that's but that's definitely the red threat 

132.91 134.12 A: mhm 

136.40 138.49 A: mhm [laughter] 

140.38 141.66 A: mhm 

141.02 147.84 B: you know and guess what those people have been marching every day since they were two years old they're ready [laughter] 

144.84 146.01 A: mhm 

146.70 156.00 A: so you know i just think getting back to the country that they really have a mess 'cause you know what's happening now the shiite muslims and those religious kurds and everybody's 

155.77 166.71 A: and the um the the turks and the kurds are all gonna be fighting over iraq as well they want a democratic society democratic freedom how these people gonna vote to pick who 

166.91 180.74 A: who who's gonna run their country then we have some man here it was our ambassador to iraq who went back and think he's now the mayor of iraq but he's gonna be iraq's next president he's the one that gave us all the insider information ah 

168.52 169.49 B: yeah 

180.64 195.16 A: how our troops should come in and how we really should get rid of saddam hussein and and craziness so you know i don't i don't i don't think we have ah um a policy yet i haven't heard it haven't read it and i don't really know what our policy is is to 

194.51 206.29 B: it's gonna be difficult it's a very difficult area i mean but in terms of the history of the world that's what you know that's what really happens people fight about religion and war it's not really relig- ah religion and land 

203.04 205.14 A: (( mhm that's true )) 

205.31 207.86 A: mhm religion and land there you go 

206.97 214.98 B: that it that's i mean if you really that's all that has ever happened all the time and it and it's still going on and i guess now we fight about oil 

210.10 211.46 A: (( mhm )) 

214.30 224.28 A: but like yeah my guess but is was it our battle to fight they would talk about his atrocities and i look at you know they were comparing him to like idi amin this was saddam hussein 

224.11 230.20 A: and all those people but far as like the you know people being murdered and mass graves nobody gone over to africa 

230.31 239.18 A: they been those hutus are they're chopping off people's arms and atrocities that you know the people in the sudan over there are you know are um 

238.32 241.54 B: yeah that the tribal warfare i mean i 

239.45 243.52 A: going through if you wanted to help a country [laughter] 

242.27 250.73 B: i guess it's just not so sophisticated and once once they once they came across the ocean and put up put up the bomb or blew up the planes that was when 

250.48 251.36 A: (( they )) 

250.62 260.81 B: you know their shit was done which is okay i believe in that i'm i'm not mad about george bush about that he was like no this shit isn't gonna go which is okay by me but um 

252.07 254.30 A: mhm mhm 

255.49 256.55 A: (( no no )) 

258.89 261.71 A: (( no no i'm just saying i understand )) 

260.93 269.69 B: it's a lot of money and it's a lot of spending and um fortunately we didn't have too many american deaths but which is not to say because i believe people are people 

262.11 262.97 A: mhm 

266.56 267.39 A: (( i know )) 

268.13 270.42 A: but they were saying one is too many 

269.81 276.07 B: and they don't even say how many iraqis died which is terrible you know they just don't count which is terrible 

272.07 273.58 A: right no 

274.48 276.85 A: i do i'd agree with you 

276.37 286.15 B: it is the killing of the brown people which is always we're always expendable whether it be the american indians or whatever they just don't care but it's a very sad situation 

278.00 279.10 A: mhm 

281.79 282.77 A: yeah 

282.83 283.66 A: (( uh-huh )) 

285.50 290.65 A: oh i i think they should just get out as soon as possible and let the u._n. red cross whoever 

290.82 302.67 A: supplies humanitarian aid to rebuild their country but you know it's a lot of money over there and i think once they found all that stores of money or whatever saddam was hiding i don't think we should have to be giving them that much aid 

295.64 296.47 B: right 

302.86 303.81 B: you 

302.95 315.98 A: you know a lot of those people were poor and desperate 'cause saddam didn't like that group he didn't like the shiites or the ku- shiites so he cut off their you know electricity they didn't have access to jobs and they were routinely you know brutalized 

315.40 322.34 B: yeah he was a dictator and he took all the money for himself but he was like everybody else has to fight in the street i'm at home drinking cognac 

316.43 317.22 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

318.06 318.91 A: and 

321.68 323.82 A: (( there you go [laughter] )) 

323.00 332.84 B: which is not that different from how we other how america is i mean we're very very lucky but let's face it the top does take make sure they take theirs 

328.46 329.85 A: mhm 

332.40 333.65 A: mhm 

332.82 342.30 B: it's funny how that's coming out now but everybody's that i always knew but i don't know why everyone else didn't know but however we're seeing how much thievery and stuff is really going on 

340.94 351.47 A: oh i know i was talking to journalists and i'm thinking like you know that's really but ah you know these people like and how much did they say they said four billion in cash in american dollars 

351.06 352.40 B: oh that they found 

351.77 355.24 A: yeah they found billion not a million billion 

354.82 356.34 B: oh my god 

355.76 364.61 A: and they were saying well we you know if if if the money isn't counterfeit this is what they'd written in the paper then the money belongs to the iraqi people 

364.21 370.10 B: right but the iraqi people need to pay us back and start rebuilding their own society and using their oil reserves 

367.99 369.38 A: (( yeah absolutely if )) 

369.58 373.79 A: they find that and i'm like who who you gonna turn that much money over to over there 

373.37 385.62 B: i know i felt funny about the b- um the soldiers who found it 'cause they at first they were heros one day then of course you know three people had to take some money but i don't know i don't i don't know what i'd have done if i had found boxes and boxes of money 

380.63 381.62 A: (( yeah true )) 

384.51 387.48 A: you know something i didn't know that was artwork i 

387.08 399.24 B: [laughter] i'd have been heading over the border to turkey i don't know i'd have been running myself i'd have just been a._w._o._l. it would've been too bad i feel bad about it but i'm i don't know it'd have been hard i must admit 

387.53 390.16 A: (( just found it you got a picture of saddam )) 

394.10 395.09 A: (( yeah )) 

396.64 397.46 A: yeah 

398.67 401.93 A: (( oh god yeah and they say well you know )) 

402.40 406.80 B: i wonder about that sometimes you know what what would you do if you just found a bag of money 

406.41 412.02 A: oh well untouched yeah i don't know if i saw it drop out some old lady's pocketbook i'd give it back 

411.39 414.85 B: yeah that yeah see it just depends that's that's good 

412.31 413.16 A: (( to her )) 

413.37 416.31 A: mhm yeah just wait it out [laughter] 

416.33 430.89 A: i don't know sometimes good guys don't don't finish first they finish last and it might be more trouble than it's worth you know i always have that nightmare scenario i find it and give it to 'em and they think i stole it to begin with and i was just trying to do the right thing and so [laughter] 

416.43 417.15 B: yeah 

420.50 421.76 B: that's true 

428.86 429.93 B: right 

430.26 435.81 B: is that that's terrible that's true nice guys don't always finish first a lot of times they don't 

431.92 433.19 A: [laughter] 

435.35 438.17 A: oh i'm a bit of a pessimist so [laughter] 

437.32 443.51 B: so i don't know what we're gonna do in iraq these days see it's terrible what they let happen to the art museum i'm very upset about 

442.45 456.88 A: yes absolutely not just you know when they looted um i love museums and things you know that kind of hurt you know because that is the cradle of you know civilization that stuff man that's going back b._c. not ad you know you're talking about before christ 

451.15 452.24 B: it is 

455.15 456.15 B: right 

456.74 466.58 A: and they looted it but then it was a heartwarming story where some of the iraqis you know bought stuff back you know mhm but yeah some people they they bought it back 

461.93 468.00 B: oh did they oh i didn't hear that that's good though 'cause i figure except that what goes into private collections 

466.95 470.28 A: mhm oh but the rest of it is on the black market for sure 

469.26 478.79 B: yeah but it but so i mean that's that's something we should just pay for and get it back that's that's helping the economy it is gonna be a black market economy to a certain extent 

473.15 473.90 A: (( mm )) 

474.64 475.41 A: (( yeah )) 

476.45 477.77 A: mhm 

477.81 481.89 A: well i hope it boosts ours 'cause this gas is still hovering around two dollars a gallon 

481.15 484.46 B: [laughter] i live in new york city so so 

481.91 483.27 A: (( [laughter] i )) 

483.47 485.64 A: yeah i know [laughter] 

484.77 488.87 B: i'm not on the gas thing but i guess a lot of other people are very upset 

487.49 501.82 A: yeah we got a good mass transport you know i'm depending on my vehicle i was in l._a. um [cough] like a month or so ago and was like two oh nine and i was going like i thought d._c. was high you know it was one it's one eighty five down here now 

496.26 497.61 B: oh my god 

499.35 500.30 B: but then 

501.36 505.40 B: but then what's funny is you think about it gas is still cheaper than a gallon of milk 

504.81 509.19 A: (( the the look at it like 'cause the average gallon is dear you know )) 

506.33 515.22 B: that's how you know you have to put it in perspective so you know we've really been terror- you know we've really terrorizing [laughter] the world for a long time probably over 

510.20 511.17 A: mhm 

514.17 524.98 A: yeah i know i just never understood that concept of war boosts the economy every time we're in a recession you know you have a war and it boosts the economy i'm saying well they've had more people unemployed 

524.96 529.39 A: with this administration's term than they did with the last so 

529.16 538.21 B: yeah it's unusual because um i guess we didn't do any we didn't do i don't know the war didn't last enough enough long enough or we didn't do enough building you know aerospace 

529.77 532.15 A: and i'm gonna say people need some jobs 

536.96 539.00 A: mhm mhm 

538.32 544.65 B: they're not building aeroplanes and stuff i so i it it didn't boost it in the way that it used to do 

540.23 541.09 A: right 

542.26 545.88 A: so a two week war yeah what does that cost you know it 

545.91 555.36 A: says boosting the economy i don't say hm we're in a war i'm gonna go out and buy me a s._u._v. this week i just don't see it [laughter] i don't see the concept i'm holding on to every dollar 

551.52 552.45 B: (( [laughter] )) 

554.93 566.24 B: i guess what well the concept is usually they we go into military production and then you have so many people who were in the workforce who leave the workforce 'cause they're in the military and that creates jobs is that what's supposed to happen 

558.84 559.87 A: mhm 

563.65 564.66 A: mhm 

565.75 566.75 A: mhm 

566.30 570.82 B: oh [laughter] [laughter] okay 'cause i didn't i don't really get it either but 

567.99 569.00 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

569.18 582.12 A: i guess it was lockheed martin and halliburton that really [laughter] you know ah were um profits went up but you know you just i just i haven't seen it i haven't seen that trickle down 

582.20 584.10 A: they need to do something here 

584.73 593.77 B: yeah i don't know we as bush has a problem with the economy i don't know what he's gonna do i don't 'cause new york is just ready to go crazy they're laying off people today 

584.82 586.91 A: (( i think a recession over here )) 

593.18 594.86 A: mhm yeah 

594.16 599.95 B: and um it gets you know when the city gets nas- nasty and dirty it gets nasty and dirty quick 

597.18 599.21 A: mhm well i how how 

599.32 599.89 A: how well
