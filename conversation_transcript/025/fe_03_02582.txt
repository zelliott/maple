1.14 2.99 A: yes hello this is michael 

2.37 4.22 B: hello this is anna 

4.40 5.33 A: (( hey anna )) 

5.02 5.98 B: hi 

6.01 6.78 A: hi 

7.20 8.59 A: okay you wanna begin 

8.23 12.52 B: what was the topic again 'cause it it didn't quite i didn't quite get it 

12.30 19.65 A: about whether we should uh disarm uh pay great attention to disarming uh iraq and send in um 

19.72 26.60 B: oh right right okay i got it oh good question i don't know [laughter] 

19.78 21.48 A: (( uh inspectors )) 

21.73 22.95 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

25.79 34.89 A: well i'm i'm pretty much pro uh getting in there and uh a- at least utilizing our diplomatic abilities in in disarming uh 

34.91 38.69 A: iraq if it's at all possible at least sending the inspectors back 

38.10 41.81 B: yeah that the inspector part sounds good 

41.52 46.93 A: yeah 'cause it it would be u._n. endorsed although i'm not a big fan of the u._n. but at least it it brings uh 

47.08 52.77 A: this uh uh united coalition together and it probably to some degree i would expect 

52.55 62.37 A: uh probably uh aggravates the needs of uh france and russia as if we really care but still at the same time you know it's as a as a universal body i think we have to 

62.04 63.43 B: (( mm )) 

62.69 68.96 A: go to that and we still haven't you know as you know we still haven't found found any indication that uh 

69.27 71.57 A: saddam hussein has had weapons of 

71.74 73.64 A: again mass destruction 

73.15 75.57 B: this is true this is too true 

75.45 77.10 A: yeah there's been 

75.99 78.97 B: and then you've gotta wonder about everything else too 

78.84 87.80 A: well that's the question you know i i think that one of the problems that we've we've had to deal with is how much have we been led down a a rosey path here 

86.99 90.44 B: [laughter] that's a good one 

88.76 92.05 A: because we were led down the same path in afghanistan 

92.02 106.96 A: and uh and now afghanistan has their own rule and once again they have the the child labor is starting up again women are not uh once again allowed in schools women once again are being oppressed in afghanistan after all that bombing after all that freedom 

98.61 100.10 B: oh lord 

107.30 116.07 A: there are major regressions taking place in afghanistan so what was what was all why did we lose boys and girls over there what was the purpose of this 

112.15 112.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

115.41 117.74 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

116.98 124.83 A: so i question that this is going to happen in iraq and now we've got all the shiites immolating themselves and flagellating themselves and wanting their own government 

124.62 134.43 A: and uh w- what were we there for it's never been really made clear other than looking for weapons of mass destruction and if there aren't any what was our president thinking 

133.21 134.34 B: mm 

134.89 136.52 B: what was he thinking 

136.37 143.46 A: yeah i i have a feeling and almost everybody obviously feels this way many people i should say feel this way unless you're really pro right 

143.57 154.96 A: that he was um he was trying to prove a fact that he was a better man than his dad well um i don't know whether that's been proven or not but in the meantime i do think at least to to stick with the topic i 

155.25 157.58 A: i do think we should be going in 

157.86 162.00 A: and i do think we should be working with the u._n. in trying to find out 

162.29 169.61 A: uh if indeed uh they do have weapons of mass destruction and this should be a long ongoing process as long as we're there 

169.36 172.92 B: yeah th- yeah i agree with that totally 

171.92 172.82 A: you know 

172.93 176.67 A: and i think it should be and i think it should be as filmed 

177.03 190.21 A: and as media um promulgated as as we have the war because behind everybody's back i got the creepy sneaking suspicion they're gonna plant weapons of mass destruction and say well see they were here 

189.65 190.91 B: (( [laughter] )) 

190.93 192.78 B: well if you ever noticed 

192.74 206.64 B: main stream t._v. doesn't show all the stuff that like oh hispanic t._v. does and like um b._b._c. does 'cause b._b._c. and hispanic television the spanish networks don't censor 

206.74 213.42 B: and they'll show the training camps and the kids chanting anti war um anti u._s._a. 

213.82 215.88 B: stuff and all 

216.40 220.16 B: it's just crazy i've seen some of the uncut videos 

220.55 229.46 A: oh i agree with you uh i i watch k._c._r._w. which of course is uh public service and they cover both sides actually 

225.74 226.31 B: (( [noise] )) 

226.50 227.08 B: [noise] 

228.73 235.06 B: [noise] yeah [noise] and then there's the religious aspect which i don't even wanna get into [mn] [noise] 

230.45 232.30 A: i mean you can see 

234.18 237.39 A: oh yeah it's it's you know we don't 

237.77 242.53 A: it's one side of me says gee i'm glad we feed those people and the other side of me says well 

238.27 239.06 B: [noise] 

242.67 244.86 A: now that they're free why you know 

242.87 253.01 B: well not not their religion it's what all the evangelists are coming out and saying that it's you know this is it look out here we go we're headed for armageddon 

245.65 246.51 A: yeah 

252.83 267.58 A: that's right yeah there's that there's also that i mean it's listen we go back for years i think it's nostradamus at the early uh thirteenth fourteenth century said something to the effect that uh our problems are going to come from the uh 

259.88 261.18 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] shh )) 

267.75 280.03 B: [noise] the east from the mid east yeah and that ch- and that they're gonna get together with china and with korea and just gang up on israel and basically blow everything up 

267.77 270.81 A: from the mid east yeah from the mid east so 

279.79 285.09 A: probably and very much destroy the one democratic nation in the midst of all that 

285.01 295.58 A: uh all the uh uh uh the theism that's going on it's really interesting you've got you're surrounded by these enormous fundamentalists but at the same time i'm surprised 

295.51 306.74 A: that that we haven't uh uh obviously opposed syria on some level because most of the people see it was so interesting with uh i think it was eleven out of the fifteen i don't have 

304.58 309.62 B: [noise] you know what's really scary and and i i was 

309.62 324.17 B: i was taken aback for a second because it happens to be part of my nationality is damascus and syria and when the evangelists came out and said this it it just stopped me cold he said it's in the old testament 

324.16 332.49 B: that um damascus will become a pile of rubble and i just sat there and i was like what 

324.20 325.06 A: that 

329.70 330.83 A: really 

332.84 336.34 B: [laughter] what do you mean it's gonna become a pile of rubble 

336.89 338.97 B: (( i don't like the sound of that )) 

337.22 338.07 A: under w- 

338.57 341.74 A: under what circumstances would it become a pile of rubble 

340.49 342.59 B: it's old testament scripture 

342.37 344.27 A: i see i see 

344.11 348.57 B: it's like in ezekiel or daniel or one of those 

344.57 345.50 A: well 

348.01 353.41 A: well the only problem and i must be honest with you since i'm i'm although religious up to a point [mn] 

351.53 357.82 B: and he said that is the only prophecy that has not yet been fulfilled [noise] 

357.13 359.88 A: oh now where's that said 

359.90 361.23 A: where's that written 

359.96 363.10 B: all the other ones have been fulfilled except for that one 

363.08 367.81 A: i wanna know what those other prophecies are because i'm not up on that that's not an area of expertise 

366.03 367.29 B: (( oh )) 

367.63 370.41 B: na- uh israel being a nation 

370.17 371.11 A: right 

370.50 376.63 B: planes trains and automobiles the fact that we have nuclear technology all that's been fulfilled 

375.28 376.26 A: yeah 

376.65 379.45 A: and and the next one is damascus will be ruined 

378.35 384.53 B: and the one is the big one that has not yet been fulfilled is damascus will become a rubble 

384.33 386.20 A: now damascus 

386.51 388.15 A: is in syria 

387.87 392.23 B: i think so if i remember my geography coll- uh correctly 

390.40 397.88 A: so if damascus is in syria and syria will be rubble who will turn syria into rubble 

397.35 402.64 B: i have no clue it doesn't go go into that you know this is all um 

402.87 404.84 B: what is the word this is all 

405.25 408.43 B: how do you say what is that word i'm thinking of 

408.25 409.37 A: conjecture 

408.99 413.57 B: [sigh] um imagery i guess is the word 

411.71 412.68 A: imagery 

412.85 417.18 A: does it say anything about the television show friends being picked up next year 

416.70 418.71 B: [laughter] no no no [noise] [noise] [noise] 

418.05 428.12 A: it's not okay all right just just because i cover some territory there um that's really interesting well i certainly hope that's not the case um but certainly here to see any 

428.06 433.74 A: any nation uh go under entirely because i always feel that it's not the people that it's the it's the 

434.04 436.61 A: powers that be the executive powers 

435.90 436.83 B: how long 

437.55 438.40 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

438.45 440.00 B: oh sorry about that go ahead 

439.93 444.80 A: that's i always think it's the executive powers that need to to be swept away not the people themselves 

442.17 443.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

443.58 444.60 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

445.33 447.61 B: shh shh go ahead i'm sorry again 

447.42 457.18 A: what you got there what you got [mn] you got two conversations going i always think it's the executive powers that need to be swept away not the people the people often are are just sort of puppets to the executive power 

454.85 456.32 B: right 

456.62 466.46 B: well the one main thing out of both evangelists that i've been watching is that you know it's not the earth that will perish away 

466.88 468.69 A: yeah 

467.98 470.47 B: 'cause it's world everlasting 

470.97 473.59 A: then what will perish just damascus 

474.60 475.17 B: [noise] 

475.29 479.91 B: (( [noise] [noise] um well syria will be- i'm sorry )) 

480.08 482.12 B: damascus will become a rubble 

482.10 483.06 A: right 

482.46 491.75 B: the church will be raptured in the twinkling of an eye and then we're in for seven years of hell and damnation excuse my french 

485.81 486.81 A: yeah 

491.72 495.75 A: hell and damnation i've gotta feeling we're already there 

495.64 497.55 B: seven years' worth 

497.41 499.34 A: seven years' worth well 

498.45 508.31 B: because a great dictator will arise out of all this conflict and will sign a seven year peace treaty with israel which he'll break 

508.40 514.49 B: like two and a half years into it setting everything into motion 

511.35 512.51 A: yeah 

514.78 519.44 B: the seven vials the seven seals the the seven plagues the whole 

515.10 516.19 A: interesting 

519.51 521.70 B: the whole bit 

521.19 523.08 A: do we know when this is gonna happen 

523.61 529.85 B: [noise] it cannot happen and every evangelist has said this before christ raptures the church 

530.42 531.48 A: well 

531.66 534.87 A: you see i'm sixty five i hope to heck i'm not around i 

534.28 536.65 B: [laughter] 

535.78 540.94 A: hope to heck it maybe i hope listen if it happens i hope i'm so gaga i won't know what's happening 

540.34 551.71 B: [laughter] well it they said it'll happen happen in the twinkling of an eye you won't even know y- you know one second you're here and the next second you're not or you've been left behind [noise] 

551.53 557.08 A: yeah i'm not sure i wanna be left behind in those circumstances well you know i guess you know 

551.90 552.66 B: [noise] 

555.27 561.13 B: yeah but religious overtones aside [noise] 

559.03 560.32 A: (( yeah now )) 

561.43 565.71 B: i don't know [noise] i don't know if it's good bad indifferent 

566.36 568.02 B: [sigh] 

568.45 573.33 B: [noise] we cannot deny what happened on nine one one but [noise] 

568.58 569.83 A: you're you're 

574.59 577.54 B: you know you gotta look at it from both sides of the 

578.07 579.79 B: [noise] of the of the coin 

578.38 592.28 A: of the coin yeah yeah well see about eleven eleven or twelve of those men that conspired against uh the united uh the the uh in nine one one were from syria 

580.99 582.21 B: (( [noise] )) 

582.96 584.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

589.34 590.50 B: [noise] 

591.63 593.50 B: yeah 

592.65 597.45 A: so it's interesting that he went after saddam hussein instead of going after the syrians 

597.39 599.89 B: (( yeah and where is [noise] osama bin laden )) 

597.49 598.99 A: that's interesting
