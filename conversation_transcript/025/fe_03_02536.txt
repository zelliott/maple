26.65 30.64 B: now what is what is the definition of ah reality t._v.

36.36 37.71 B: oh i 

36.90 43.18 A: like that are oh like american idol and all those shows you watch any of those 

42.72 48.37 B: well um just parts of 'em spasmodically when they when i have the free time but i don't 

48.59 55.15 B: i don't spend a lot of time watching 'em but ah if i'm happen to be come across 'em i'll probably watch 'em for a few minutes 

54.73 55.96 A: yeah 

56.39 68.77 A: oh when they first started out the fad was it was nice it was good to see people doing natural things on t._v. but after a while it it's really sickening now [laughter] 

67.83 73.90 B: getting way off from ah from being a ah a ah educational type of thing huh 

73.21 75.81 A: exactly and it's not creative at all 

75.53 78.72 B: [lipsmack] i see where you ah located joya 

78.35 79.75 A: i'm in new york 

79.39 80.59 B: (( new york city ))

80.63 84.03 B: oh boy i'm in ah n- new hampshire 

81.37 82.82 A: yeah [laughter] 

83.66 84.96 A: (( oh okay )) 

84.61 85.83 B: yeah 

85.23 87.50 A: i've been there a few times [laughter] 

87.48 88.93 B: (( well ah )) 

89.65 93.80 B: [mn] we're supposed to talk about this one subject here for for ten minutes 

93.10 95.31 A: yeah the reality t._v. 

95.34 103.24 B: well in the case that i'm not fa- too familiar with it ah how i'm g- [laughter] you know it'd be difficult for me to say too much 

100.22 101.46 A: [laughter] 

102.68 108.43 A: yeah um let me think well i think a lot a lot of it is um 

108.47 117.12 A: i don't think it would've been acceptable years ago like the who wants to marry a millionaire it's like you herd all these women 

117.31 125.65 A: onto the show and they all compete [mn] for each o- compete against each other to marry someone who's allegedly a millionaire 

126.00 129.63 B: so actually this ah going back a oh probably 

129.98 136.10 B: quite a few years there was a program called the millionaire but that wouldn't be what we're talking about is it 

135.54 137.08 A: no no no 

136.58 137.48 B: no 

137.16 141.97 A: this is where they pick a whole bunch of women from all over the wor- over the country 

140.03 141.04 B: yeah 

141.53 147.91 B: yeah how many ah i mean how long have these so called reality type of p- programs been going 

148.05 151.53 A: um the first one i can remember 

151.67 156.41 A: was back when i was in high school like maybe eight years ago 

155.78 158.27 B: oh not too long ago huh yeah 

156.74 170.22 A: no and um there was a a the first reality show i remember besides like general game shows was on m._t._v. and was called the real world and they took these seven people who didn't know each other 

169.86 171.07 B: yeah 

170.47 177.05 A: and they um made them live together for i think six six months i think 

176.44 177.68 B: yeah 

177.08 177.94 A: in 

177.98 182.11 A: apartment in new york and they all had to just get along 

182.15 187.58 A: like they didn't know anybody they didn't they weren't their they didn't all their personalities were different 

187.62 193.23 A: and um they had to live together and i think they also had to get jobs 

193.47 196.42 A: i think they were given jobs by m._t._v. [noise] 

195.83 196.79 B: uh-huh 

196.96 202.12 B: well would ah the program called fear factor would that be t- is that type of a program 

201.55 208.08 A: yeah that i think that's i think that's more re- i think that that would be considered reality show also 

207.59 208.78 B: yeah 

208.21 210.68 A: although to me it's more of a game show 

210.27 211.42 B: yeah 

210.85 214.17 A: but i think that's considered reality show too 

214.53 218.85 B: but the general public seems to go for these in a big way i guess don't they 

218.00 224.12 A: exactly you would think that they'd get tired of the same format over and over and over again 

223.74 225.14 B: right 

224.67 227.80 A: yeah but no people are still doing it 

228.04 233.31 B: so you don't think these programs are staged they are more or less ah spontaneous ah 

232.55 241.84 A: oh no i'm convinced they're staged even the real world like [mn] now they're hav- now they've been doing it i think for like eleven of twelve years now 

234.69 235.68 B: you are 

241.95 244.69 A: and the first one 

244.96 247.05 A: it seemed very real 

247.24 253.68 A: it was like brand new and it didn't seem like they were manipulated to act certain ways 

253.21 254.19 B: yeah 

253.62 262.61 A: and the people were all different and but if you watch it now after all these years have progressed now it seems more 

262.40 272.23 A: where the producers want to show all the bad stuff that happens and [lipsmack] it's funny because all the cast now all the people that are chosen to live together 

266.58 267.36 B: yeah 

271.68 273.39 B: yeah 

272.56 274.47 A: all look like models 

274.02 275.09 B: uh-huh 

274.83 284.05 A: it it's ridiculous they all have perfect bodies well what society considers perfect bodies there's not one person who's overweight there's not one person who's ugly 

277.53 278.45 B: yeah 

284.01 287.93 B: so they're kind of getting out of the realm of reality in that sense aren't they 

287.21 290.72 A: exactly exactly like they might as well just give them a script 

290.39 293.85 B: [laughter] [laughter] right 

290.73 292.45 A: [laughter] 

292.95 297.10 A: it's more like ah like six months of improvisation [laughter] 

296.85 303.08 B: so you say they've been going for about eight years have their ratings being going higher and higher over that eight year period 

303.14 304.63 A: i think so 

304.42 305.34 B: (( now )) 

304.88 319.60 A: i think so i think it's well it's a different generation now that are watching it like i still watch it every now and then but i think that now's younger generation i think they just enjoy seeing good looking men and women scantily dressed on t._v. 

308.50 309.45 B: yeah 

317.78 318.91 B: yeah 

319.16 322.85 B: so do you think the ratings will continue to climb 

322.47 324.20 A: i think so 

323.54 324.82 B: yeah 

324.28 336.06 A: yeah i i i i'm i i would hope that society would get sick of it and start showing less interest so we can start getting more imaginative shows back on t._v. 

335.68 339.74 B: yeah i well i agree on that point yeah yeah 

337.77 338.96 A: (( yeah )) 

339.90 343.77 B: but ah it doesn't look like it might happen right away i guess huh 

343.19 348.10 A: no i don't think so 'cause every time you look at it there's a new one [laughter] 

347.47 352.82 B: well they seem to be getting ah an increase in th- those types of programs huh 

352.12 354.67 A: yeah yeah now they have the show 

354.75 368.25 A: um called mr personality where they have all these men who have to wear masks all the time and there's one woman and she has to pick the man that she wants to be with based on his personality 

361.26 362.76 B: oh yeah that's right 

367.60 369.51 B: is that a fact 

368.88 376.33 A: yeah but then also on another night they have show wh- called um extreme makeover 

376.27 378.19 A: where they pick two people 

378.09 389.98 A: and they give them this big huge makeover where they get like they can get a nose job and boob job and liposuction and all this plastic surgery to look like the person that they really want to look like 

389.87 399.85 A: so it's like you know on one hand they have this show where you're supposed to be judging people on personality and then they have a another show which is totally on the opposite spectrum where 

399.88 404.91 A: they're changing their image using plastic surgery to look what society thinks is beautiful 

404.89 412.75 B: but yeah there again it's i don't know it's getting it's not in the realm of reality 'cause how many people can afford those kind of treatments huh 

411.98 416.11 A: exactly exactly yeah all those humans that want 

415.83 416.98 B: wow 

416.58 417.81 A: (( yeah )) 

417.61 420.13 B: so um hm 

420.39 428.40 B: but the thing is about programs like ah candid camera and you know things like that ah people don't seem go for 'em much now do they 

427.69 433.75 A: yeah they they rarely come on i think candid camera might come on one of the cable channels 

433.15 440.77 B: yeah well i mean th- you know i find those interesting and um i usually watch them if they come on and i'm watching 

436.97 438.10 A: mhm 

439.61 446.15 A: mhm i guess that would be considered kind of a reality show because it's dealing with the real people 

444.05 450.85 B: well yeah i mean it it it it is catching people in their ah natural ah [lipsmack] ah frame of mind i guess huh 

450.00 461.05 A: well they actually actually they now have a a modern day version of that called punked and it's with ashton kutcher he's from the um that show that t._v. show called the seventies show 

460.70 461.72 B: yeah 

461.11 465.55 A: and it's on m._t._v. and he actually does pranks on celebrities 

466.14 468.57 A: and it's a half hour show that comes on 

468.24 470.03 B: oh is that 

468.85 472.06 A: and it's it's he wants to show that you know 

472.09 477.63 A: um just regular people aren't the only ones fall for these things and that celebrities are human too 

477.27 478.55 B: (( oh i see )) 

477.89 489.70 A: and like they had um one guy i forgot who is he's an actor and they set him up to go to the rest- to this restaurant with his friends and they had another group of people come in 

481.96 482.93 B: (( yeah )) 

486.32 487.31 B: (( yeah )) 

489.83 502.49 A: [lipsmack] and act like they were buying him drinks because they were a fan fans of his so they kept ordering all this stuff and all this stuff and then they leave and the waiter comes over to the celebrity and gives him this eight thousand dollar bill 

492.21 493.03 B: (( sure )) 

494.64 495.58 B: okay 

502.02 503.06 B: wow 

502.81 517.64 A: and he's like this is not mine and then so the waiter starts getting upset and the manager comes out and then ah the guy the actor gets really upset and he's getting ready to storm out of the restaurant and they come they tell him it was a practical joke and it was really funny 

503.14 503.70 B: (( [noise] )) 

517.67 522.32 A: but ah yeah i guess that's the new generation of bloopers [laughter] 

521.74 522.51 B: (( yeah )) 

522.34 524.26 A: and practical jokes 

524.48 534.83 B: so actually the the survey that's taken by the college is trying to evaluate ah what people are watching is that what the ah college is trying to evaluate 

534.25 535.80 A: these calls now 

535.45 544.19 B: well no well you know they want us to talk for ten minutes on about these reality programs are they more or less taking a survey 

541.83 542.91 A: yeah 

544.10 547.85 A: i'm not sure that's a good question i wonder what their motives really are 

547.66 548.65 B: yeah 

548.07 553.66 A: because it's ah supposed to be a speech pathology to see how people converse with each other 

553.05 554.39 B: yeah 

553.83 565.01 A: but i wonder if is just about i guess it's if we happen to get another scheduled call with other people we can see what questions they ask and see if it's leaning towards t._v. 

562.73 563.45 B: yeah 

564.80 566.89 B: is this your your first call 

566.43 567.60 A: yes 

566.97 568.17 B: (( oh i see )) 

567.77 568.78 A: yep 

568.19 574.85 B: now there was something said at the beginning after the ten minutes up to do something what was that about 

574.26 578.43 A: i think they're gonna come back on and give us directions on i think they're gonna 

578.64 581.88 A: ah ask questions about our opinions on i guess how the call went maybe 

581.55 583.44 B: (( oh i see i see )) 

582.52 583.47 A: (( yeah i'm )) 

583.51 584.61 A: not sure 

583.98 586.82 B: well we got how many more minutes to go here 

586.26 589.34 A: i don't know i wasn't paying attention [laughter] 

587.99 596.62 B: well according to my clock we've been talking about thirteen or fourteen about ah thirteen minutes so i guess we better talk for two more minutes [mn] 

595.76 599.05 A: [laughter] [laughter] oh gosh 

598.59 599.89 B: (( well ah ))
