149.64 151.62 B: (( god this is weird )) 

157.96 169.95 B: i know that's why especially it's like you know whatever like somebody in atlanta and somebody in new york but if there's if there's a million people doing this right now like there are phone numbers being exchanged left and right right now but it is 

164.83 165.96 A: mhm 

167.90 172.38 A: thank you definitely is it's a big hook up line that's what it is

196.23 197.61 A: yeah 

196.94 205.42 B: i never even saw that i never did see it 'cause it's directed by the guy that did like the godfather like i was like what is he doing making a movie where robin williams is playing a seven year old 

197.99 198.81 A: it's 

201.64 202.85 A: (( really )) 

204.38 211.14 A: i know right it's that's crazy i didn't know that but it's it's sad like it's not even it's like really sad

218.91 231.12 A: it was on t._v. i didn't i came in at like nine fifteen or so but it was still set and i came in probably like a quarter to eight maybe ten minutes later something like that but it was sad i was like this is so sad 

219.89 220.79 B: yeah 

230.57 238.42 B: well this is maybe maybe you know what you need to to pick you up after watching a sad movie is an opportunity to to hook up with reality television 

236.68 250.05 A: (( exactly like i'm off the tape now so i have to call a a roommate from college i was like why didn't you tell me that movie was sad but now you know i got something else to talk about like this is really this is different we're supposed to be talking about survivor right hm )) 

246.74 247.48 B: (( you )) 

247.61 248.70 B: got nothing 

249.31 261.11 B: well i mean that or or reality television in general i just i didn't know that that i didn't know what this thing was gonna be about i didn't think i was gonna be talking about reality television 'cause i it was sponsored by a school so i thought it would be like 

261.34 267.51 B: you know whatever they'd ask us a question about like you know genetically modified food or something [laughter] it'd be like 

263.24 264.76 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah this is )) 

265.98 269.40 A: [laughter] they say it's like a 

267.52 271.84 B: [laughter] be like quizzed by some professor somewhere i didn't think it was gonna be like 

271.45 272.79 A: yeah this is 

271.95 275.69 B: do you watch like who wants to marry a millionaire and why like 

275.09 288.00 A: you know what you would think that they would have like some type of mediator or something on the phone but i bet you they're saying about reality television exactly but it would tell like they're they're actually researching like 

280.28 284.52 B: having instead of having a robot which is what we talked to 

288.00 294.84 A: what'll happen if two strangers [laughter] you know what i'm saying [laughter] connected on the phone you know something silly like that 

290.64 291.85 B: it probably is 

294.09 296.41 B: i remember i did one of these things ah 

296.60 304.92 B: 'cause this is just like you know whatever you can do stuff like little studies at school or whatever when i was in school i used to be able to do 'em all the time and it's nice way to get like an extra couple of dollars 

300.79 301.67 A: mhm 

304.42 305.41 A: mhm 

304.82 318.10 B: i did one at n._y._u. and it was like they gave you this it's like you know they give you five dollars for this questionnaire and like this is kind of like weird random questions it's like what do your parents do and then they gave like a couple of hypothetical situations and i was like i don't really see 

312.43 313.27 A: (( mhm mm )) 

317.95 329.99 B: what this is about and then at the end of it they basically were like well would you like the money now or would you like to enter a lottery to see if you could win like a hundred dollars or whatever and i think the whole test was basically an excuse to do that 

325.47 326.65 A: (( mhm mm )) 

329.44 330.73 A: yeah pretty much 

330.20 336.29 B: like there's like the smoke screen of it was the actual stuff i had to fill in and it was basically like testing people's optimism or whatever 

335.40 337.13 A: mhm 

336.30 344.34 B: but i don't know what this one is actually supposed to be i think it probably is like whatever what happens when a guy in new york calls a girl in atlanta that he doesn't know 

339.07 340.76 A: (( yeah definitely is )) 

343.82 352.40 A: [laughter] you know that's what it has to be 'cause i mean reality t._v. [mn] whatever that's what it's all that's what this study is really about i'm convinced 

350.89 356.80 B: yep do you actually watch any of it just out of curiosity i feel like we oughta give 'em something something to work with i 

354.30 355.28 A: um 

355.39 361.21 A: you know what i watch i watch um tsk tsk i watch reali- no the only thing i watch is like um 

361.25 364.02 A: (( american idol i don't know if you consider that a )) 

363.51 366.09 B: haven't seen that it's it's reality enough 

365.63 368.21 A: (( yeah americ- you don't look at american idol )) 

367.93 372.91 B: i've seen it bits and pieces but i don't really i mean this whole thing is that i work a lot of times at night 

372.41 373.63 A: (( mhm mm )) 

373.04 384.86 B: ah because i i have like a second job so a lot of times i have to like come home and i'll i'll watch like basketball or baseball while i'm eating dinner but for the most part i don't i don't think i even have any shows that i watch too regularly 

379.92 380.99 A: mhm 

384.51 386.72 A: well who are you going for in the play offs 

386.59 389.77 B: oh right well i'm a i'm grew up in new jersey so i'm a nets fan 

389.58 398.76 A: oh is that right i haven't quite chosen a team yet so i'll see [laughter] last year i was the six- i was you know i was going for the sixers it wasn't last year or the year before i was with the sixers 

390.46 391.42 B: yeah 

393.46 394.59 B: [laughter] 

396.86 405.53 B: oh they're they're amazing to watch i feel like they'll probably beat the nets if they play 'em like i don't think there's anybody on the nets that wants it as badly as iverson does like that guy just 

404.14 405.19 A: yeah 

405.82 416.51 B: unbelievable to watch like he's smaller than i am you know like i'm a little little runty freelance writer in new york and like the guy's like five ten just taking people apart all over the place 

408.37 409.48 A: yeah 

410.88 411.78 A: [laughter] 

415.85 421.14 A: yeah he is off the ch- well you know like small guys have that complex or whatever you know it's like 

420.43 427.93 B: yeah i think he's definitely like that 'cause that guy like i'm sure like i don't know how many basketball teams cut him before they realised how amazing he was and now he's just like 

421.99 423.04 A: yeah 

426.50 427.54 A: mhm 

427.74 440.60 B: getting revenge on all the people that picked him last when he was like ten but he's god he's fun to watch i think that that's probably the nets are eventually gonna wind up playing 'em and it'll be fun to watch him 'cause it's always fun to watch him but i'll hate to watch him beat my team 

429.46 431.19 A: [laughter] 

433.65 434.72 A: yeah 

438.48 439.45 A: mhm 

440.01 442.70 A: yeah that might not be too great but you know 

440.61 441.42 B: (( but yeah )) 

442.81 447.71 A: all right he's [mn] but you know who i'd the only thing that i just don't want the lakers to win 

447.21 448.57 B: oh i hate 'em 

447.96 452.46 A: yeah that's the only thing i don't really care who wins as long as the lakers don't win 

450.19 451.50 B: (( really hate 'em )) 

451.66 456.70 B: i went to school in los angeles or around los angeles and i got 

454.91 455.77 A: uh-huh 

456.53 463.13 B: so so dis- i mean i didn't really care when i was out here 'cause like i mean i grew up a nets fan the nets were always terrible so like 

462.95 474.27 B: the lakers had you know they weren't even on my radar like once a year they would like beat the nets really bad and i'd be like well well it happens and then when i was out there and like you had to deal with like laker fans all the time and like 

467.71 468.51 A: uh-huh 

473.14 474.05 A: (( [laughter] )) 

474.09 480.44 B: everybody going on about how great they are and like koby's all over the place and he's being photographed all the time it just like 

480.95 492.05 B: i couldn't take it i didn't want to hear anything else about them and i was the more like god if they win again it would be very very sad i mean my roommate's from minnesota and he's a big timberwolves fan so he's pulling for ah 

483.83 484.94 A: right 

492.25 500.59 B: for them to win the game tonight i was actually going to go out and meet some friend and watch it but i guess i won't do that until the robot cuts us off after ten minutes 

493.74 494.87 A: right 

498.95 504.21 A: (( i know right [laughter] oh wait it this like how long is this supposed to be like ten minutes or so )) 

500.93 501.77 B: [laughter] 

503.42 506.95 B: it's something like that i think we're probably most of the way there by this point 

506.39 518.72 A: yeah you know it doesn't seem it it's it's just funny this whole thing is crazy but you know speaking of the lakers i was just like that like people feel like that with the falcons like oh you know i'm for the falcons all the way and you know 

510.65 511.56 B: yeah 

517.42 523.10 B: i've always liked them i used to be a huge andre risen fan when i was a kid i thought he was the coolest when i was like twelve 

522.58 524.21 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

523.60 530.81 B: 'cause he was that was right when like left eye burned down his house and everything and my i was like this guy's amazing like he's got the most interesting wife 

527.05 529.13 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

530.41 532.36 A: you know you're a player dude 

531.78 533.33 B: (( but it's like you )) 

532.52 533.82 A: [laughter] 

533.42 540.04 B: [laughter] but yeah he um he was that was my favorite falcon team when it was like him and like jerry glanville was coaching and like 

539.34 540.51 A: (( mhm )) 

539.82 551.51 B: i don't know but yeah i don't think people resent the falcons too much i mean 'cause it's like i like vic is kind of like iverson in the fact that like people might dislike some of the ways he plays the game but like god he's fun to watch 

550.99 559.75 A: right well you know what i think it's because it's new like you know vic's only been in what last year was really his first year i think the first year he was like red shirt or something 

557.61 560.17 B: (( yeah the first year he was playing a lot )) 

559.56 568.63 A: yeah so i mean it's just 'cause it's new like in a couple of years if it's still going the way it is people like man screw the falcons you know what i'm saying whatever 

567.86 568.52 B: (( [mn] )) 

568.41 581.90 A: just like you know just like ah like the braves like i know they might they're not having like that good of a season this year but you know when they were bad they were bad and then they got good you'll hear go yeah braves this braves that

585.21 587.90 B: (( yeah i know but people get used to it )) 

588.08 599.90 B: yeah i remember when i was a kid i remember when they were really bad 'cause i used to i grew up in jersey but i used to go to hilton head in south carolina with my parents for vacation and we used to get the only baseball games we'd get would be the bra-
