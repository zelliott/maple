1.76 2.87 B: hello 

2.57 3.94 A: hello 

3.97 6.24 B: hi this is jonathan how are you 

5.97 8.19 A: just fine hi how are you i'm tessie 

8.00 9.14 B: hi tessie 

9.55 12.08 B: uh what do you think about reality t._v. 

12.88 18.24 A: um i probably watch more of them than i'm supposed to [laughter] 

17.34 19.24 B: and which ones in particular 

18.93 21.51 A: oh my gosh um 

21.81 29.94 A: [lipsmack] survivor american idol [sigh] big brother uh the bachelor shows because 

30.91 36.01 B: and why do you choose those rather than the traditional fiction based television 

35.90 37.98 A: it seems [mn] 

38.75 42.61 A: it's [mn] i guess it's just watching real people real life 

42.94 47.81 A: and it's it's interesting to see what goes on 

43.11 43.93 B: right 

48.42 50.64 A: with real people rather than 

52.30 54.34 A: just what somebody wrote some time 

52.58 55.65 B: just actors just something scripted do you 

54.74 56.01 A: (( mhm )) 

56.09 60.88 B: do you feel that this is all spontaneous that it isn't scripted in any way 

60.83 66.15 A: oh some of it i feel is definitely scripted especially shows like survivor 

65.99 66.85 B: right 

66.29 70.99 A: um some of the things just appear to be very scripted 

71.06 78.39 B: and how does that make you feel do you think that there's something less authentic is there something more deceptive about that the illusion of reality 

76.62 82.01 A: no i think it's it probably makes for a better a better better television show 

81.94 82.80 B: okay 

82.36 96.16 A: to have a portion of it structured and and and possibly script- uh script- uh scripted but at least if it's structured you know somebody's watching out to see that the viewers are actually going to get 

96.43 99.01 A: something out of it that they're looking for 

99.21 108.08 B: and it it there seem to be character types in each of these shows the the same way that you would find in a a traditional drama or situation comedy [mn] 

106.12 112.18 A: mhm mhm mhm that all i suppose has to do with the casting people 

111.91 112.97 B: right 

112.44 118.23 A: um so you know somebody definitely knows what what people are wanting to watch [laughter] 

118.10 123.42 B: right and well i guess it was the real world on m._t._v. that started a lot of these it seems like 

122.12 129.52 A: real world road rules yeah those are i know they're a couple of shows i i don't watch consistently but um 

130.24 132.23 A: you know i i have seen those 

132.45 133.69 A: (( um )) 

133.70 140.45 A: even the shows like uh trading spaces and while you were out you know the 

136.36 136.92 B: (( [cough] )) 

138.06 138.93 B: right 

140.49 143.25 A: the other shows that are using real people doing 

143.62 146.33 A: you know basically non scripted things but 

146.40 147.42 A: (( um )) 

148.01 150.94 A: that to me is a type of reality show too 

151.04 162.60 B: do you think that there's some sort of [mn] is is is there a pleasure to be [mn] derived especially in uncomfortable situations when people get i know on some of these shows the people get humiliated in front of the entire country 

163.60 164.56 A: (( um )) 

164.29 167.21 B: i think on the bachelor that might have happened a couple of times 

165.94 170.64 A: yeah and i don't know that there's pleasure that comes out of it but it's certainly real life 

170.38 171.29 B: uh-huh 

170.82 172.78 A: i mean it's something that 

173.94 183.73 A: they don't necessarily write into you know a show like friends or something like that we know all of that is you know put together to to follow a storyline 

183.69 194.35 A: but i mean [mn] on the reality show on the bachelor that's what the whole season is leading up to is that one particular you know is he or isn't he you know which one is he going to pick 

183.82 184.65 B: right 

194.19 195.22 B: right 

194.67 198.72 A: and they keep us hanging on every week with it [laughter] 

198.48 202.03 B: so the emotions are real the people are experiencing 

200.18 201.15 A: (( mhm )) 

201.62 203.93 A: right it it seems like it 

203.96 212.75 B: yeah now what about has have you cut back on the other types of television that you watch now because you're watching all so much reality based t._v. 

212.48 219.01 A: um [sigh] i would say yes and probably the area that has been cut back is sitcoms 

219.10 220.66 B: okay so you 

219.65 225.23 A: because the dramas are s- i'm still probably watching the same number of drama shows 

225.07 225.98 B: right 

225.27 228.14 A: um but it's sitcoms that i've cut back on 

228.93 237.31 B: uh that's interesting i'm sure that the sitcom writers are probably not too happy about that however it seems to be it seems to be a trend though i think that's so it's probably true 

232.73 234.35 A: probably not [laughter] 

235.73 249.78 A: yeah but it's kind of hard to do a real well and i guess they have 'em reality shows like e._r. and you know the practice things like that there's always court t._v. and and trauma room and things like that but they don't have a storyline 

245.03 245.98 B: right 

249.97 250.82 B: right 

250.03 259.24 A: so whereas the reality shows that are on right now do tend to have some sort of a a continuation from week to week 

259.44 270.41 B: do do you ever feel yeah do you ever feel like you're on on the reality shows it's it's there's something some [mn] almost a little bit voyeuristic about it i mean it's like peeping through the keyhole at somebody on those things [cough] 

259.70 260.55 A: (( so )) 

269.52 275.05 A: um originally when big brother came on yes that's definitely how it felt 

272.90 273.85 B: (( mhm )) 

274.94 275.85 B: right 

275.24 281.34 A: um now i think that they structure their day in such a way that it doesn't feel that way anymore 

281.29 289.09 B: so you're just kind of along with them you're one of the you're just another set of eyes rather than somebody who's watching without people knowing that you're watching 

288.03 290.14 A: right right 

289.38 290.23 B: yeah 

290.46 296.23 B: so there's something more participatory in this than [mn] there would be in in in a sitcom definitely 

295.79 297.82 A: well yes especially when 

298.02 306.41 A: [mn] the majority of the reality shows now days seems like that they want the public to call in to vote on this or that 

306.18 307.21 B: right 

306.55 310.21 A: so you know the people definitely know that they're being watched 

309.83 310.69 B: uh-huh 

310.34 312.92 A: um they're playing it 

312.96 316.99 A: as the shows are progressing they're playing more to the camera 

316.87 317.81 B: right 

317.36 322.86 A: rather than you know just sitting around doing nothing like the first season of all these things did 

322.68 324.47 B: right because it seems to me 

324.43 332.65 B: [mn] it it seems to me [mn] that a lot of these people they uh they they go into this with their eyes open certainly but it seems like they're trying to leverage it into a career 

332.31 333.38 A: (( mhm )) 

332.50 340.51 B: they think well when the shows end they end up on you know on entertainment tonight or they end up on the tonight show or the david letterman show or 

338.95 343.82 A: right that's they're all trying to get back on television for something 

343.61 351.59 B: right they're trying to use it as a as a [mn] leaping uh stepping stone to some kind of a film career or acting whatever it is entertainment 

350.35 351.72 A: mhm 

351.67 352.53 B: yeah 

351.77 356.56 A: and honestly i haven't seen to my recollection any of them 

356.80 361.69 A: do anything past their you know their second fifteen minutes 

361.45 362.41 B: right 

361.74 368.04 A: um you know they're on their show and then they may do a a talk show circuit or something like that but then they're done 

368.05 369.30 B: right yeah 

368.23 370.96 A: i haven't seen anybody do anything else [laughter] 

370.33 380.13 B: right i i remember that there was that one girl from the original survivor i think colleen is is the one she made she was in that a movie but that didn't you know she didn't she disappeared after that yeah 

376.79 377.80 A: yeah 

377.82 379.17 A: lucky break 

379.56 381.90 A: and it was an awful movie [laughter] 

381.05 390.21 B: yeah yeah so i guess that's the the idea that they have a lot of them they go in thinking they're going to be able to to use it to leapfrog to something else 

389.65 391.66 A: right right 

390.77 394.68 B: now which which one would you say is your favorite of all of them 

394.81 396.41 A: um survivor 

396.19 400.17 B: survivor is and that's been what it's in the third or fourth season now 

396.99 398.01 A: yeah 

399.83 403.68 A: it's five or six actually 

402.15 405.09 B: is it that many now wow i didn't even realise 

403.99 407.10 A: yeah 

406.16 410.85 B: now how 'bout the american idol the only one that i really watch is american idol 

410.46 413.07 A: mhm i'm very much into that one right now 

412.88 422.16 B: yeah that that one i i'm surprised that i have i didn't watch it last year but somehow i got i i i turned it on this year and it is it's very addictive 

421.70 430.94 A: last year i came into it um when there were probably five people left and this year i started out with the auditions 

430.41 431.48 B: right 

430.82 439.47 A: so you know that was a different perspective too to see how they pick the people to to be put on to these shows 

439.17 440.08 B: (( right it )) 

439.71 441.72 A: um so that was interesting 

441.69 443.51 B: seems like the odd yeah 

441.79 447.49 A: to watch it from the beginning up to now which you know there's what four of them left now 

444.50 445.87 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

446.83 450.67 B: right who did they get rid of last night i didn't even i didn't get to see that 

450.12 451.33 A: uh trenice 

451.34 452.44 B: (( oh okay )) 

451.77 456.22 A: it was actually between trenice and reuben last night 

453.96 456.86 B: (( mm wow )) 

456.83 461.63 A: and josh grayson just kind of skated by so 

460.27 461.92 B: (( mm yeah it's )) 

462.31 464.16 A: which is interesting [laughter] 

463.44 476.76 B: it is it's i mean i think of lot of that is [mn] the the fact that he's been able to linger is because there's a patriotism right now and the fact that he's a marine i would say i don't know that he's necessarily as talented as as some of the i don't think he would've made the cut if he weren't a marine 

470.94 472.05 A: mhm 

476.49 479.67 A: [mn] i don't either i i i definitely don't 

479.41 481.69 B: and he played that up yeah 

479.91 488.24 A: and i think we'll probably start seeing a lot more of those type of people cast on these shows because i mean it's definitely 

485.41 486.65 B: right 

488.48 495.30 A: a a draw you know for viewers to watch something like that the timing for him was perfect 

494.94 496.47 B: sure sure 

495.69 498.93 A: so you know i think that they will start 

499.41 510.25 A: looking [sigh] at the casting a little a little more closely and tr- you know trying to put people on there that other people are interested in and you know what's going on in the time 

502.01 502.79 B: uh-huh 

510.11 518.31 B: sure yeah they want to make it possible now how 'bout when that that one what was his name corey he got dismissed because he had beaten his sister up or 

517.52 520.85 A: because he [laughter] he had a criminal 

520.64 521.52 B: right 

520.87 526.55 A: um something show up on his on his past and they just kicked him off in [laughter] the middle of the show 

524.09 524.84 B: (( oh )) 

526.40 538.82 B: and the other i think there was another one of them the earlier people who was dismissed because she had a background she was in vide- um internet porn or something hm 

533.44 535.02 A: frenchie is 

535.20 547.64 A: right and she's actually gone on to talk shows and she was on jenny jones and stuff like that and you know i mean she's had her fifteen minutes even though she didn't get to be on the show 

547.46 550.14 B: right she found a way to get the attention 

549.66 551.61 A: mhm mhm 

550.34 551.03 B: (( [mn] [cough] [lipsmack] )) 

552.38 556.74 A: so i it's definitely about the the attention um 

552.53 553.22 B: (( huh )) 

555.89 565.72 B: now do you ever feel guilty uh [mn] because it seems like there's nothing really enriching about it i you know uh it seems like it's almost it's do you feel as if it's junk food 

565.93 572.35 A: it definitely it is definitely the junk food of television um because there is absolutely zero 

572.39 583.75 A: educational value you know nothing redeeming about the shows at all there's nothing that we learn from it there's nothing you know that you can walk away as a better person for having watched it 

573.95 574.92 B: right 

577.06 578.05 B: right 

583.35 584.41 B: right 

583.88 587.08 A: but it is entertaining [laughter] 

586.14 593.15 B: right and and that's i guess at at the end of the day what people want is they i guess they they get their mental stimulation another place 

591.83 596.69 A: yeah yeah [mn] you know th- we've all we've got the discovery channel for 

596.72 599.95 A: all of the other [laughter] but when it comes 

598.40 599.50 B: right
