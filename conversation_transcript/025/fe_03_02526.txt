184.23 187.13 A: who wants to marry- i think i've seen that too 

187.17 188.65 A: (( couple of times )) 

187.30 192.39 B: [mn] what what what do you think of the new one mr personality did that come out yet 

192.19 194.60 A: i don't think i've seen that what's that one like 

194.59 201.69 B: it's about the a girl who um dates like i don't know ten or twelve guys and they all wear masks 

201.92 204.14 B: so she doesn't know what they look like 

201.95 204.94 A: oh i think i've seen the previews for that 

204.96 212.41 B: yeah i don't know they probably picked out like really ugly guys on purpose just so that she'll be shocked at the end you know 

212.58 213.58 A: [laughter] 

214.84 217.69 B: i mean isn't that the point you know [laughter] 

216.70 219.61 A: yeah we'll try to get 'em to 

220.39 223.47 A: like 'em for their personality and based what they 

223.02 223.86 B: right 

223.53 226.38 A: like 'em on their personality and not their looks 

226.37 227.56 B: yeah 

227.85 231.93 A: i don't know i don't i don't really like all these shows like um [lipsmack] 

228.78 229.85 B: (( [mn] i'm )) 

233.39 237.64 A: or the bachelor or whatever and they're like you know all this girl with 

237.41 242.23 A: this guy's got to choose from all these women you know and and somebody's 

242.20 253.81 A: you know like he's kissing all these girls and saying i love you to all these girls and dating all these girls and then all these girls get hurt feelings and they all think oh i love him and all these girls [laughter] compete for this one guy you know 

251.30 253.35 B: (( sorry yeah [mn] )) 

253.90 258.46 B: yeah well about that one where um they got married married by america 

258.84 260.00 B: (( did you see that )) 

258.98 260.25 A: yeah 

260.36 265.67 A: i mean that's just crazy because even you shouldn't just marry somebody you don't even know and [laughter] 

264.75 265.94 B: [laughter] 

265.97 266.86 A: [laughter] 

267.68 269.43 A: i don't know that's 

268.60 272.04 B: well none of them got married at the end i don't think so 

272.30 273.80 A: oh i don't know 

274.14 280.43 B: yeah 'cause it i think what they did they had a bunch of couples and then they got eliminated one by one you know 

280.84 287.93 B: and then at the end um two couples you know went to the altar but neither of them uh got married you know 

289.09 289.87 A: hm 

290.14 297.68 B: i guess you know that's good i mean it shows that people would still [mn] you know won't make that sort of step [laughter] to make the money 

296.53 298.15 A: (( [laughter] yeah i hope not [lipsmack] )) 

298.43 299.80 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

300.50 306.62 B: i don't know [noise] um when do you think this whole thing's going to end this like reality craze thing 

306.87 318.04 A: i don't know i think it's just getting uh bigger [laughter] i think it's you know they're they're coming out with more and more you're always hearing about oh this is going to come out and this is going to come out and and 

310.70 311.86 B: really 

316.60 319.74 B: yeah do you think they all started with the real world 

320.65 323.50 B: is that like the origins of all this reality t._v. 

322.19 325.65 A: i think so yeah i think 

324.94 326.56 B: (( and the osbournes )) 

326.85 328.02 A: and what was i 

328.12 336.78 A: think it started really though too like big brother and and survivor were the first the first big ones i think 

336.68 337.82 B: mhm 

336.80 339.83 A: you know and then they started coming out with some of these other ones 

340.04 340.88 B: (( all right )) 

341.13 343.44 A: like fear factor and everything 

344.99 349.43 B: [mn] yeah we have to come up with like guesses on what they're going to do next [laughter] 

350.80 352.14 B: (( [mn] i )) 

352.47 353.62 B: (( don't know )) 

354.86 355.44 B: (( mm )) 

355.85 357.26 B: do you have a favorite 

358.20 361.75 A: and pro- i would probably say 

362.67 366.57 A: fear factor but i don't watch it that often but when i do watch it i mean 

367.05 369.94 A: but either that or big brother when it's on 

367.65 369.13 B: oh 

369.90 375.12 B: you know what i thought was pretty good but i only saw one episode of um the mole 

375.43 379.11 A: yeah the mole yeah that was a good one i liked that one 

378.55 383.62 B: that was like better i mean it was actually like kind of suspenseful and stuff you know 

382.73 386.51 A: yeah that was good that was yeah i would say that was my favorite 

386.51 388.18 B: (( yeah that's the only one )) 

386.81 400.73 A: i i liked the host too because he was really i don't know he was kind of like a nice guy and it was cool because of like who's the mole [laughter] and you had to like try to figure it out and yeah 

392.89 394.05 B: yeah 

396.20 397.04 B: (( [mn] )) 

399.01 399.85 B: yeah 

400.52 403.51 B: uh yeah i think that would be my favorite one 

403.65 409.32 B: 'cause i don't like you know like who all these contest ones they they seem kind of silly 

409.33 411.25 A: yeah 

409.91 414.94 B: you know like everyone competing and stuff for one like person or whatever 

416.59 417.24 B: (( mm )) 

417.34 421.07 A: yeah i don't like the dating ones as much i like the ones that are more 

421.48 423.02 A: exciting 

423.00 424.17 B: yeah 

424.56 436.96 A: you know where they're like competing or something like that but when they're just like dating or i mean i don't really care for like the bachelor and those kind of ones but [lipsmack] i like the ones that are more active 

432.73 433.80 B: yeah 

437.10 439.44 B: mhm do you ever watch real world 

439.86 444.88 A: i used to i know what it is but i didn't in a while 

442.86 444.73 B: (( yeah i i don't know )) 

444.74 449.38 B: the last season it was like such a show rather than real you know what i mean 

449.80 453.21 B: like everyone it was obvious they knew they were acting 

453.86 455.80 A: oh yeah 

455.07 456.44 B: i thought so 

456.31 460.73 A: and well there's this new one out i don't know if it's really reality t._v. but um 

461.29 466.88 A: i think it is would it be considered reality t._v. where they're doing the makeovers 

466.54 467.14 B: (( mm )) 

466.94 469.43 A: they're doing like the extreme makeovers 

469.58 475.98 B: i haven't heard of that so it's like a talk show you know how they have like sally jesse and they'll make over people 

476.72 490.01 A: i mean they're actually no they actually go through like [mn] extreme makeovers like where they redo their whole face with plastic surgery and and everything is like extreme [mn] it's yeah like why would you 

483.79 485.23 B: oh man 

487.21 488.61 B: oh that's crazy 

490.47 494.70 A: you'd be so you know like to be so unhappy with yourself that you have to 

495.13 499.61 A: redo yourself and that's the only way you can be happy with yourself is how you [laughter] look you know 

499.74 501.99 B: (( yeah and i don't know )) 

500.50 504.13 A: you got to have surgery to make yourself look better 

503.91 506.16 B: and they want the whole world to know 

505.82 513.43 A: yeah you just i mean [mn] it's like well i look like a barbie doll but whatever [laughter] you have to do to get that way you know 

511.63 512.54 B: [laughter] 

513.36 516.89 B: yeah would you ever ever go on a show 

516.68 520.34 A: no i don't think so nothing like that 

518.93 519.72 B: (( no )) 

521.36 522.15 B: (( no )) 

521.64 534.02 A: maybe big brother or [laughter] something but i mean that one doesn't seem as bad you know just being in a house i mean there's some challenges and stuff but i could never do something like survivor or fear factor or 

529.67 530.43 B: (( [mn] mm )) 

533.88 534.74 B: (( yeah )) 

535.85 538.60 A: (( [lipsmack] to be actually on there or anything like that ))
