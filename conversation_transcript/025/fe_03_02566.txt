22.45 27.41 A: uh knowing what we're supposed to do just talk about the subject right

37.36 38.73 A: so um

40.73 42.11 B: what was the subject 

42.39 46.39 A: oh well what what one should do about iraq and uh 

46.42 54.92 A: first she had mentioned that it had something to do with the arms inspection but i guess i guess in general iraq in general 

54.37 55.83 B: oh i see 

56.78 57.88 B: yes it had 

56.93 57.74 A: (( yeah so )) 

57.86 64.76 A: that's certainly a a subject of interest to me i i follow the i follow uh 

65.17 68.58 A: all kinds of things about the world very uh 

69.03 79.89 A: very closely actually i'm quite yeah i'm quite upset about what's going on so i um really followed it i don't feel there's much i can do myself but uh 

70.91 72.08 B: oh yeah 

80.08 82.09 B: right right 

80.34 89.55 A: i thought i think the little person is really not consulted really very much about these things [laughter] except for the peop- what yeah go 

88.74 89.60 B: (( [mn] no )) 

89.91 90.74 B: i 

91.20 92.02 B: (( hello ))

92.33 94.45 B: oh no no i was just listening to you 

94.18 99.78 A: yeah no i just i just don't think the little person this far is consulted [mn] 

100.29 104.10 A: we lack uh any kind of uh influence i think yeah 

104.87 111.11 B: okay yeah yeah [mn] so so you you think the um 

111.20 115.49 B: uh it was it was a good thing or it was so do you think it was a bad thing the war 

115.82 129.24 A: oh i think the war is definitely a bad thing 'cause they didn't tell you the real reason uh for the war i just don't think that we're being told what's really going on although although people have a pretty good indication of what's going on 

122.29 123.35 B: right 

129.36 130.42 B: right 

129.76 134.71 A: uh but they're not really being told that th- they're being told oh it's only to uh 

134.85 141.48 A: you know to get rid of this uh bad guy and to make sure he doesn't have any uh weapons or for this and that 

141.63 152.17 A: uh which i you know those things might have happened in the course of what they wanted to do which i believe was just they wanted to control they just wanted to take control of that area of the world 

152.11 153.16 B: (( right )) 

152.60 156.38 A: which uh yeah i think that was 

154.96 156.24 B: right there's 

156.92 158.02 A: (( yeah go on )) 

159.50 162.60 B: yeah it i believe it had a lot to do with um 

163.59 166.78 B: with power uh you know power money 

166.23 167.59 A: mhm 

167.23 168.30 B: there's a lot of 

168.36 172.30 B: you know who who wants to own the oil the rights to the oil and uh 

171.56 174.14 A: yeah mhm 

172.51 173.71 B: (( that type of thing )) 

174.57 179.18 A: that's right yeah i'm afraid that's really what it is and uh 

179.12 190.58 A: whether it produces some good things along the way that might have happened but uh although although the jury's out on that yet also we don't know yet they they certainly don't have democracy there yet 

188.20 189.42 B: [laughter] 

190.91 193.20 A: we'll see what happens 

192.42 194.78 B: right right no i i 

193.49 194.96 A: (( yeah )) 

195.15 200.61 B: uh it seems like it seems like it was some sort of a war game 

200.66 204.76 B: [laughter] you know uh um you know 

201.03 202.64 A: yeah yeah 

206.27 209.44 B: for the wealthy people for the wealthy they're just playing a little game there 

209.27 217.66 A: isn't that isn't that true yeah and they use the people who you know the people who sign up for our armed service our people who uh 

217.60 232.26 A: you know they're mainly the poor people and who couldn't get a- another job and they figured oh that maybe they'd get an education this way but of course their main idea is to kill people that's what and now they have to do that and and be killed of course 

219.95 221.21 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

231.89 233.47 B: (( right right )) 

232.29 237.53 A: and uh it's it's such a tragedy it's just it's just horrible and 

236.91 237.92 B: (( it is )) 

237.60 239.75 A: (( yeah and it )) 

239.20 247.67 B: how do you feel um so y- you how did you feel about um or how do you feel about what our how our president stands how he handled the situation 

247.64 260.86 A: well i mean i think that he's i mean he is just i think that it's the people he brings with him that they're really in control i mean he's he's doing what the very large corporations want him to do [cough] 

260.80 262.11 B: (( oh okay )) 

261.25 275.66 A: which is expand power you know of course the oil obviously we know about the oil but there's bechtel they're in they're in it for a lot of money too the construction the reconstruction they're all making a lot of money from it of course the people who gave all the weapons uh 

268.95 270.56 B: right 

275.81 282.53 A: military industrial complex which president eisenhower already warned us about that they're totally in control now 

280.99 281.77 B: (( but it )) 

282.69 284.00 A: yeah 

282.90 287.67 B: that's true okay yeah i i didn't quite look at it that way but yeah that makes a lot of sense 

287.55 288.91 A: yeah 

288.98 292.85 A: yeah i think these these big corporations are really 

293.14 305.76 A: uh i mean i hear the most amazing quotes from from people as far back as president lincoln already was warning did you know that lincoln warned against the corporations he said the corporations are going to be the downfall of the united states 

298.84 299.62 B: yeah 

306.02 307.97 B: (( right )) 

306.35 312.15 A: because they started to get a lot of power during the civil war period and he warned about that already 

312.20 313.31 B: right 

313.96 316.08 A: [mn] yeah hm 

316.46 320.66 B: [laughter] so there there was a lot of insight to that way from way back 

321.80 330.20 A: yeah so you know i don't know we're seeing uh some i'm i'm very troubled by today i don't know what's what's going to happen 

322.63 323.19 B: (( [mn] )) 

327.67 328.63 B: right 

330.23 337.51 B: oh okay so you feel like um the president really is not the influential like everybody you know you hear a lot of 

337.62 339.74 B: uh comments regarding the president 

340.13 340.97 B: uh 

341.18 346.01 B: but you you believe that he's more like a puppet on a string to the corporations 

346.92 350.39 A: yeah oh definitely and all all the people with him i mean they're all 

350.00 350.84 B: yeah 

350.19 362.30 A: it's just so happened it's kind of an unfortunate thing but they've all take control now they're all um they're all there they're all the whole government practically including congress where they're all congress agrees with them 

362.36 366.66 A: and and i'm afraid even the democrats sort of agree with the republicans 

367.19 368.93 B: (( yeah )) 

367.50 368.06 A: (( [mn] )) 

368.97 372.58 A: yeah it's very bad because they don't you know [laughter] 

372.95 384.98 A: i mean i [sigh] i live in new york city and we're we're a number one terrorist target here and he he's increasing the amount of uh people who might wanna do something against the u._s. you know 

378.87 380.20 B: right 

385.07 394.49 A: all right he's saying that he's huh the [mn] he's not really he wasn't able to to really find um any of the people who really might uh 

394.52 408.79 A: be be a head of some of these terrorist groups he wasn't able to do that and he's going after i in my opinion iraq had nothing to do with anything i mean the guy was not a nice guy saddam hussein but he had nothing whatsoever to do with any of these terrorist people 

408.93 409.94 B: oh no no 

409.52 421.65 A: and and now they haven't found any of those weapons of uh this and that mass destruction they haven't found that and i don't trust 'em now if they come up with something i have a feeling they're going to plant them now at this point 

416.11 417.07 B: right 

419.10 420.83 B: [laughter] 

421.73 425.01 B: so who do you think who do you think is uh 

425.57 427.17 B: involved with the terrorists 

427.40 429.11 B: (( what do you [mn] )) 

427.61 432.14 A: well i think they were a bunch of uh you know gangs of uh 

432.05 445.36 A: having nothing to do with a government if anything they had to do with saudi arabia i don't know but i mean they were gangs who were you know just did that but we know there were something like fifty people involved nineteen of who were on those planes 

440.06 441.11 B: right 

445.85 447.53 A: you know and i mean 

447.72 454.80 A: they're they're trying to come up with they're just full of revenge and all right i understand they feel terrible that this thing happened um 

455.46 461.34 A: but they're just going after targets like afghanistan these targets that are like you know 

461.72 465.45 A: just an excuse like you know to take control 

465.61 466.55 B: right 

466.20 474.18 A: uh take away our liberties too by the way here at home i think they they want a permanent war footing because if they have permanent war 

474.30 479.08 A: that means the uh people may go out of money in the defence uh department 

479.34 482.53 A: that's what they want they they use that as an excuse 

482.64 483.47 B: oh 

483.84 487.56 A: it's too bad it's it's it's terrible but 

488.84 490.02 A: (( uh i don't know )) 

489.31 489.93 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

489.95 491.00 B: (( could be a )) 

491.02 492.33 B: private gang 

493.49 495.93 B: i mean nothing to do with the government itself 

497.44 499.34 A: uh which w- where 

499.65 505.77 B: from ir- you know from uh the middle east it could be something that's totally not non governmental it could be just uh 

505.96 510.11 A: yeah these religious uh fanatics you know they they use uh 

508.57 509.52 B: right 

510.15 519.11 A: the problem is you see they would get nowhere if the u._s. would have a light footprint on the world like if they 

519.12 524.84 A: you know if they'd hold back their corporations from just taking so much control all over the world they'd hold back 

524.85 537.52 A: then if these fanatics came around and looked for support and they can't do anything without support they wouldn't find support if if the u._s. was well liked around the world but they're making themselves so hated you know 

537.38 538.39 B: right 

538.03 541.87 A: that fanatics can find a lot of recruits you know 

541.99 543.08 A: it's 

543.13 545.62 A: or they can find a support system 

545.55 546.62 B: (( [laughter] )) 

545.92 554.76 A: it's it's very very unfortunate i think i think they're just dead wrong meaning bush and his people they're just i know i have a feeling that 

555.34 565.92 A: they might have attempted to just show the u._s. as being like a crazy maniac out of control to try to scare people so they don't do anything that might be behind their thinking 

563.89 564.79 B: right 

565.96 569.24 A: i just think they're wrong i think it's gonna backfire 

569.56 572.41 A: i don't know i hope it doesn't but i think it is 

569.79 570.91 B: oh okay 

572.03 573.34 B: (( right )) 

573.56 577.52 A: 'cause nobody likes a bully you know and the u._s. is being a bully 

573.87 574.54 B: (( they )) 

575.64 577.58 B: [laughter] 

577.53 585.06 A: uh i don't know might be wrong all right they say oh they respect us they might hear us but they respect us well i'm not so sure 

585.14 594.65 A: i mean i- if they if they happen to be wrong well here here we in new york are going to be blown up so i don't wanna i don't wanna risk that so 

593.73 599.89 B: yeah [laughter] i don't blame you i don't blame you at all i know it's it's a very scary um
