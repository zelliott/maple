0.20 1.66 A: good morning 

0.85 2.18 B: hi 

1.81 3.29 A: hi my name is jeff 

2.82 4.53 B: hi my name is marion 

4.32 5.44 A: hi marion 

4.94 8.08 B: and we're in trouble 'cause i don't watch those shows 

8.14 10.71 A: neither do i i don't watch television at all 

11.59 12.60 B: okay 

11.66 15.93 A: so ah i don't really watch i don't i don't i know about them 

15.29 16.41 B: mhm 

16.17 23.70 A: so um i can talk why i feel people are are so thrilled about them but i don't why do you not watch them 

23.20 26.42 B: just seems stupid and i don't i think it's fake anyway 

26.17 27.93 A: (( ah you think it's all rigged i )) 

27.31 28.52 B: yes 

28.56 32.36 A: mean the people are they're actors kind of like a jerry springer type thing 

32.31 41.83 B: um well from what i had heard that these shows started during some writers' strike and they were cheaper to produce 

39.02 39.97 A: uh-huh 

42.36 45.97 B: and i don't know i just i don't believe 

46.18 49.03 B: the things that are going on anyway 

48.70 51.97 A: and they are cheaper to produce because they're not using actors 

52.16 55.28 A: so you don't have to use actors and they're not um 

55.36 66.66 A: they're not written per se so you're right about that i think people i think people watch them because it it they live their life vicariously you know what i'm saying they wanna be those people 

66.99 70.40 A: so they they kind of like they kind of transfer their ah 

70.98 72.37 A: their interests 

72.40 80.39 A: and that per se they kind of wish that they were like you know who wants who wants to marry a millionaire for example they kind that's kind of like their fantasy 

77.75 79.63 B: mhm 

80.43 82.70 A: so it's an escape for a lot of people 

82.21 87.15 B: but what would be the difference than any other show or soap operas which i do watch 

87.47 88.69 A: um 

89.82 99.44 A: because these are these are not actors these are people like you know people that they their cowo- these could be their coworkers or their family members and such there there's some sense of 

99.45 100.88 A: of connection 

100.95 101.95 B: okay 

101.00 111.67 A: but at at the same time there's a fantasy as well they kind of like wish they wish they were a participant because it looks like a lot of fun somebody sitting on the couch they're kind of 

109.33 110.80 B: mhm 

111.92 113.91 A: in the scene where a soap opera 

114.31 118.20 A: it it kind of takes on a different tangent does that make any sense 

118.08 119.34 B: a little bit 

118.88 121.60 A: yeah so what soap operas do you watch 

121.27 123.20 B: well i tape everything 

122.77 123.91 A: (( yeah do you )) 

123.96 125.80 A: i'm a big one life to live fan 

125.35 127.79 B: uh-huh i like that 

127.31 129.74 A: yeah so i guess we have to stay on the topic 

129.31 131.78 B: [laughter] 

130.65 131.95 A: but um 

132.12 137.54 A: yeah i mean all these reality shows i used to watch the did you ever watch the real world with m._t._v. 

137.01 138.10 B: no 

138.02 141.36 A: yeah that was that was a cool that was that's what started it all 

141.58 143.40 A: that's where they take um 

143.86 149.98 A: like five you know college graduates some of them weren't even college and take 'em to some remote place 

149.68 150.85 B: mhm 

150.17 152.03 A: (( and they would um )) 

152.16 164.55 A: not remote but like you know some town and and just film them for like twelve weeks and all the interactions and they would have some sort of thing that they had to do like either be a d._j. on a radio station 

164.73 168.60 A: or um something of that nature 

168.11 171.42 B: so do you think they're geared to a certain age group 

171.85 173.54 A: what these reality shows 

172.95 174.31 B: mhm 

174.08 183.90 A: yeah i would think so i think they're i think it depends on the type of show though like who wants to marry a millionaire or the bachelorette or the bachelorette i think really attracts um 

184.13 186.44 A: ah women i mean the bachelor 

185.00 186.42 B: mhm 

187.07 193.87 A: i think that that um but i also heard that men watch that show too but but i'm under the impression a lot of women 

193.88 196.20 A: watch the bachelor just to see 

196.56 198.25 B: nice looking guy 

197.78 203.68 A: yeah a nice looking guy and how many you know and the cat fights i guess and i heard a lot of that is um 

204.45 211.75 A: you know don't forget they film like for a zillion hours and they only use like one percent of it are you aware of that 

209.89 215.22 B: mhm no ah i i'm not up on those shows at all 

214.81 217.29 A: yeah so that they do they um 

217.50 221.74 A: they'll put the camera on for a long time and then they'll take the parts 

221.81 224.88 A: that they want the viewers to see so therefore 

224.93 232.53 A: you're right it is it is rigged in a lot of ways because you're not seeing the total the before and the after you're just seeing the event 

231.91 233.88 B: mhm 

232.94 237.71 A: so it it gives the impression that something more dramatic happened than really happened 

238.35 249.81 B: i i know a few ti- my son's seven and and ah you know time to go to bed i'm watching um i don't know if it was the bachelor or the bachelorette one but i'm like no 

248.25 249.17 A: uh-huh 

250.20 251.39 B: (( no )) 

251.62 261.84 A: and also i think it's kind of dangerous don't you i mean look at what happened to ah who wants to marry a millionaire where where she had to like get an annulment and everything because i thought 

260.52 263.33 B: yeah wasn't wasn't he a fake millionaire 

263.68 266.90 A: i think he was real but i think he had a shady past i 

263.72 264.62 B: was he 

266.32 267.32 B: okay 

267.37 270.59 A: think i think he abused his first wife or something 

270.76 274.53 A: but um yeah and it but a lot of these people want you know 

274.75 277.11 A: their fifteen minutes of fame too 

276.75 282.11 B: um and how do you think they differ than ah those court ones 

282.08 283.66 A: oh the court t._v. 

283.14 284.39 B: yes 

284.54 287.06 A: i guess those are reality shows too in a way 

286.76 289.49 B: i mean do you believe them or or 

289.19 294.60 A: ah you think those it depends i heard like divorce court remember the old t._v. show divorce court 

293.86 295.26 B: (( mhm )) 

294.87 296.21 A: that was rigged 

296.60 299.96 A: because i had some friends who were actors who were on that show 

299.41 300.59 B: oh wow 

300.71 308.36 A: so yeah so i think they were they were the script the um the cases might have been real but those were actors playing the parts 

308.97 313.63 A: so um yeah i but i i think it's another type of ah reality show 

314.70 320.68 A: but um i wonder what the have you heard any of any reality shows that are gonna be like down the pipe that are coming up 

320.06 321.23 B: no 

321.45 323.26 A: yeah i think um 

323.87 331.19 A: they're they're constant- there there's this new one that they're trying to they're trying to do the real beverly hillbillies where they're gonna take um 

331.50 334.48 A: real hillbillies from the ah appalachians 

334.09 335.45 B: mhm 

334.52 336.60 A: and put 'em in beverly hills 

336.63 344.48 A: and h- and have the whole the whole nine yards with a maid and a mansion and everything and put on the camera and see how they ah 

344.99 346.38 A: how they cope 

345.92 348.55 B: but what do you think the purpose of that is 

348.67 351.07 A: i felt like they're making fun of these people 

350.47 353.49 B: th- that's what it sounds like to me 

353.56 358.48 A: and um a lot of people in appalachians or the appalachians are getting are very upset 

358.83 371.80 A: but um yeah there's a whole big search for i don't know they may even found them but see the whole thing is like what you said at the beginning of the conversation these are very inexpensive to produce and they gain very very high ratings 

371.81 375.23 A: 'cause again i think people are just like so curious 

375.99 377.42 A: (( and ah )) 

377.52 382.62 A: and such about how it's all gonna play out it's kind of it is kind of like a soap opera 

382.91 388.05 A: i mean i think it's more similar than than dissimilar these reality shows to a soap opera 

387.87 388.90 B: (( wow )) 

388.45 391.33 A: because the the same curiosity 

391.62 393.10 A: takes place 

392.60 395.43 B: but ah in a shorter period of time 

395.10 398.33 A: right right much shorter 

398.37 404.99 A: and the drama but the same similar types of drama where people cheat and and things of that nature 

405.71 409.94 A: so um yeah i i just think that these reality shows 

410.47 416.46 A: i think more people like them than don't like them and people i think people are constantly trying to come up with new ideas 

417.50 420.68 A: but to me with the whole phenomenon of survivor 

420.24 421.22 B: mhm 

421.04 424.20 A: that started in that started in england didn't it 

423.84 427.00 B: i i that's another one i didn't watch 

426.60 427.89 A: yeah 

427.26 429.65 B: i mean watching um 

429.91 434.12 B: who gets to eat bugs on an island just doesn't do anything for me 

433.43 438.88 A: right and then but then they have it then they had temptation island did you ever hear about that 

437.50 439.30 B: no no 

439.08 442.77 A: well that was an interesting concept where they would take six couples 

442.73 443.94 B: (( oh )) 

443.45 447.54 A: and um they they weren't married but they were close to marriage 

446.93 447.96 B: mhm 

447.58 452.63 A: and then they had to go on a different side of the island and um 

453.47 461.60 A: so they were separated and then women were with the men and men were with the women strangers and see if they 

461.79 464.24 A: if they would be hooking up or not 

463.86 465.04 B: mhm 

464.71 468.05 A: so that was that was that was very controversial 

469.06 471.19 A: but it's interesting most people 

471.49 476.06 A: are not i mean some people are are critical of it but most people see 

476.13 479.00 A: it just part of the as a new fad i 

478.67 479.68 B: mhm 

479.26 484.93 A: mean every time there there's something different remember like in the eighties there was like dynasty and 

483.92 485.11 B: yes 

485.36 488.57 A: and ah those and dallas and those type of shows 

487.94 490.42 B: the night time soap operas 

489.60 492.22 A: right night time soap operas so now 

492.26 494.98 A: the new phenomenon is these reality shows 

495.00 495.76 B: (( mm )) 

495.30 500.54 A: but it all started with um um um you brought up a good point the whole thing with the wr- writers' strike 

499.94 500.96 B: mhm 

501.04 502.43 A: that is true 

502.39 511.58 A: i've heard that that is true that and they are very cheap to produce and they make a lot a lot of money because people are watching 'em and 

511.51 517.40 A: and ah it'd be interesting to see what comes next i mean i mentioned the beverly hillbillies but i think there's other shows 

517.67 520.80 A: that people are thinking of my brother pitched a show 

520.94 522.25 A: of um 

522.73 525.34 A: having people in a halfway house 

524.89 525.81 B: uh-huh 

525.82 532.68 A: and have the cameras on them and i i don't know if it went anywhere i don't think it did but um 

532.72 536.29 A: you know people are in the industry are constantly trying to 

536.87 542.11 A: come up with a new idea a new setting particularly 

541.51 547.92 B: well now wouldn't this be now i can't think of the name of the movie and i saw it the one with jim carrey in and he 

546.83 548.56 A: yeah the truman show 

548.40 551.55 B: yes all on that idea 

550.85 556.13 A: yeah yeah it's all pretty similar for the in the truman show he didn't know he was being filmed and 

555.51 556.85 B: right i 

556.20 559.61 A: everybody else did in this everybody knows they're being filmed 

560.11 561.71 A: but um it is 

561.91 564.12 A: it is an interesting phenomenon 

564.58 569.24 A: and it it is it is curious to know why people are not more upset 

570.45 573.49 A: and ah and they're they're extremely popular 

573.14 578.19 B: know to see you you're exposed in so many different ways i 

577.96 591.72 A: right but every so often it gets tainted i don't know if you heard about big brother you know they they try to do their best job screening these these actors i mean these people then once again these houses they some things come out like this one guy 

585.59 587.11 B: mhm 

591.90 596.28 A: ah had a had a record where he assaulted somebody with a knife 

595.87 596.66 B: (( oh )) 

596.52 598.84 A: and i think he even did it on the show 

599.23 599.89 A: (( he like walk- ))
