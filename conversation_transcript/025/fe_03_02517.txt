15.54 25.82 A: i when it first came on and they had the survivor show i watched it and some of the things that they did i thought were ridiculous because 

25.86 36.46 A: i mean you had men and women out there based in the or out there in the wilderness and they're running around eating everything [mn] it basically just a gimmick to watch 

36.53 46.28 A: watch the people get to watch [mn] people watch t._v. it's a fantasy that people like to look at and fantasize what they would do if they were in that situation 

46.54 47.60 A: i really 

47.70 50.95 A: don't like those reality shows like that because 

51.78 65.72 A: it look like it it played on people mind but nobody in their right mind will put theirself through that torture and eat worms and snails and stuff like and eat rats and stuff like why would you eat a a rat 

65.82 75.87 A: just because you want to win a million dollars i mean money's one thing but your pride dignity and you don't know what kind of disease you might get is another thing 

75.58 79.56 B: right well ju yeah just like all these now the the 

79.78 85.91 B: married by america and the bachelor and all them i mean i just can't imagine going on a show like that 

85.59 87.48 A: (( i can't ei- well look )) 

87.72 100.72 A: who want to marry a a millionaire something like that you're going to have twenty ten to twenty women they know they competing for the love of one uh this man some [mn] and the only reason they want to be on it because this person's rich 

101.01 102.00 A: i mean 

103.27 104.62 A: (( [mn] in reality )) 

104.84 107.04 A: if you going to try to marry somebody rich 

107.57 109.23 A: (( they not going to come from a )) 

109.42 113.34 A: a background they looking come from a background like you are 

113.22 114.13 B: yep 

113.77 117.23 A: they looking from a background same as they have 

118.96 126.54 B: yeah i i agree it's like as you said i watched like the first season of survivor and i thought it was ridiculous [laughter] 

127.05 130.70 B: and i haven't watched any of that since like 

131.34 136.41 B: i can't say that i haven't watched any of 'em but like i don't routinely sit down to watch 'em 

136.56 141.49 A: i got a question do you think it's a fantasy or you just think it's a money making gimmick 

141.53 142.86 A: (( for the network )) 

143.59 150.67 B: i think it's kind of both [laughter] i think it's a gimmick and i think they found something that they found the public likes to watch 

150.72 152.89 B: (( seeing as it is so far fetched )) 

150.80 151.55 A: [noise] 

152.99 160.11 B: so people will watch it i hopefully people aren't believing they're doing everything or that it's r- some of the stuff is even real 

160.35 165.82 B: um but i think it's a gimmick that they found that they like because i mean everytime you look there's a new now 

165.29 174.92 A: yes there's there's survivor one survivor two survivor australia survivor in the outback there's survivors all over the world survivor in the ara- in the amazon 

174.37 175.57 B: yep 

175.80 176.73 A: i mean 

177.01 182.73 A: who would you risk this life down in the amazon with all those poisonous snakes and things down there 

180.14 180.73 B: (( no )) 

182.58 183.41 B: (( no )) 

182.74 191.44 A: just trying to make win money i mean yeah i like to be a millionaire and i like to be rich or something like that but what use would it be being a rich 

191.67 193.82 A: individual when i'm dead yeah 

193.12 203.89 B: exactly yeah i mean i it's like now at least like there was the survivor it's like you know you see previews on the t._v. and stuff for 'em i mean these people as you say they look half dead 

203.91 207.31 A: and something else i don't like about those shows or something like it 

208.92 212.36 A: you get to vote who you want off the island 

213.00 214.10 A: (( so so [mn] )) 

214.34 216.47 A: so you can get the strongest person 

216.85 221.06 A: like everybody can get the strongest person and vote him o- him or her off the island 

220.46 221.41 B: right 

221.54 228.01 A: so what reality they might be the strongest person on in this series but you gonna 

228.02 229.79 A: vote them off the island because 

230.21 232.15 A: you figure your chances are better 

232.21 233.65 A: (( if they're not there )) 

233.40 234.31 B: right 

235.01 239.90 B: yeah so it's kind of stupid it's like not the real person that should win is even gonna win 

239.39 241.15 A: mhm 

240.38 242.62 B: since they have a say in it and stuff 

244.05 247.23 B: even like i enjoy more of the um 

247.35 254.64 B: the musical like the american idol and stuff like that i enjoy that more but even like i'm watching it this for the second season now 

254.94 257.08 B: and i'm like getting tired of that 

257.35 259.38 B: and it's like my husband and i said 

259.40 261.77 B: this will be the last time i watch this 

262.00 265.10 B: it's it they go too far with all of them 

265.31 267.83 B: it's like one time of 'em would've been enough 

267.90 270.58 B: but they kind of keep building on it 

269.26 276.86 A: they keep pushing and pushing and pushing it on the americans' intellect like oh [mn] americans will watch anything that we put on t._v. 

276.49 277.62 B: yeah 

278.68 284.43 B: but i guess they must be doing something if they can keep doing 'em now i guess people are still watching 'em 

284.17 295.87 A: yeah i guess the neilson report where so many people watch this show so many people watch that show i guess the rating is up or something like that because i can't see why some 

292.09 293.21 B: yeah 

295.93 301.07 A: put theirself through that ridicule and put theirself through that danger to be on those shows 

301.64 307.81 B: right i i agree with that i mean just as you said the eating some of that stuff they want you to eat on some of them 

307.92 310.28 B: and it it's just like i just can't 

310.44 312.47 B: imagine doing that for money 

312.78 321.79 B: as you said who wouldn't want to be a millionaire you know it's like or whatever they give for these shows yeah it'd be nice but to really put yours- your life in danger 

321.63 330.03 A: yes and like on those shows like tho- who want to marry a millionaire or the bach- bachelor or the bachelorette or something like that 

330.05 338.47 A: oh if you going if you trying to win the the heart or marry somebody a bachelor that's worth a billion dollars or something like this 

338.26 339.16 B: uh-huh 

338.58 340.77 A: and there twenty people 

340.81 349.88 A: what are all the women d- are all of them sleeping with the guy or something just to try to win his favor or something like this so they humil- the one that don't win do they feel 

351.05 354.33 A: what do they what do they get humiliated or what 

354.54 359.08 B: you would think i mean even the one that did i don't 

359.16 364.53 B: there was one that she actually married him or whatever i forget what that one was called that she mar- 

365.07 371.52 B: you know like the the guy came on and he was a millionaire whatever and the woman married him and then you know like a month later they divorced 

371.77 374.12 B: and it's like well what was that to prove 

374.47 376.21 B: i don't know i just don't 

376.67 380.65 B: i don't know why somebody first of all would even put themselves in that situation 

380.58 381.77 A: (( mhm and [mn] )) 

380.67 383.12 B: and it's like you're not really going to know 

383.14 384.28 B: the person 

384.18 386.05 A: and i i feel 

386.59 394.48 A: that they playing on the intellect by calling 'em reality shows what rea- what's real about those shows there's nothing real about those shows 

393.89 394.81 B: (( right )) 

395.33 399.95 B: yeah [mn] we agree my husband and i agree on that that they aren't [mn] 

400.04 404.42 B: really real [laughter] they're just more entertainment and stuff and they're all acting 

404.26 405.05 A: (( yes )) 

405.20 406.15 A: i mean 

407.12 413.49 A: you can put somebody on the island for thirty days or something like that and not give 'em nothing to eat and everything they're going to have to catch their own food and all this stuff 

413.80 415.90 A: i don't believe well 

416.14 419.48 A: i don't believe they on this they just on this for 

419.67 423.02 A: the by the time they being filmed 

423.12 427.75 A: the rest of the time i don't think they doing all this stuff it's just a show i believe 

428.73 432.51 B: yeah it's like you only you're only seeing a little bit so what are they doing 

432.65 435.60 B: the other twenty three hours that they're not showing us 

434.73 436.81 A: mhm 

436.19 441.01 B: are they just sitting back i mean definitely on survivor they don't look too healthy but 

441.63 443.63 B: i can't imagine they're um 

443.86 446.82 B: really living that life twenty fours a day 

446.83 448.06 A: that's the truth 

448.86 450.69 A: and all 

451.67 452.53 A: then 

453.33 454.70 A: like i say before 

454.73 458.72 A: what's real about the i mean really if you go at the 

458.99 460.13 A: if you get 

460.32 462.59 A: cau- get out there in the wilderness 

462.99 471.11 A: by accident and you have to survive some of that that's realness but you getting pushed out there because you trying to win money there's nothing real about that 

470.51 471.40 B: right 

471.83 477.07 A: that's why i said they just playing on american intellect by telling them this is a reality show 

478.64 481.74 B: i know but somehow they keep getting more and more out there 

481.12 488.57 A: yeah but yeah like ever since that first season there have been more and more reality reality type shows like this 

488.68 499.57 A: and like i said i don't find nothing real about 'em like i watched the first one the first few pilots first few episode of pilot series of survivor 

494.79 495.35 B: (( mm )) 

499.27 500.21 B: uh-huh 

499.85 505.69 A: and out of that after the first three shows there weren't nothing real about that because 

505.77 518.03 A: like you said the people were looking bad and some were looking bad there was someone was getting off the island to get down to the last few people and they was like but they got to vote who off the island they want 

518.21 523.20 A: like who the weakest link they going to k- kick the person they want off the island 

522.93 524.73 B: so they can try to be the 

524.20 525.26 A: mhm 

524.98 525.99 B: the winner 

527.20 533.15 B: yeah i don't know i mean it's like i i i kind of hope they stop doing these like just 

533.30 534.99 B: i don't enjoy 'em 

535.66 537.61 A: i know but there must be some 

535.68 536.70 B: and 

537.65 541.40 A: there must be a large segment of the population that do enjoy 'em because 

541.96 545.00 A: if they didn't enjoy 'em and somebody wouldn't watch them 

545.61 551.34 A: they wouldn't be doing 'em and that's one thing else about the reality show like after they show it one time 

551.40 553.18 A: it's not like these uh 

553.49 560.78 A: these sitcoms um you can still show a sitcom and then you can come back and have it have reruns on it and to go into syndication 

560.83 568.00 A: would you want to see a reality show and then go back and say oh let's see this reality show ag- again two years well i know what happened already so 

568.09 579.98 A: even though you know what happened on sitcoms um it's still funny or something but you go you wouldn't sit back and watch the reality show again because you already know what's going to happen you know whose going to win so there's no mystery to it 

571.40 572.38 B: (( yeah right )) 

580.66 583.92 B: yeah that's true so i gu- there's no resale value um 

583.52 592.95 A: yeah that's i think that's the reason that they keep developing more and more of those reality shows because there's no resale value they don't they don't go in syndication or anything 

593.81 597.17 B: that is true i never really thought of that aspect 

599.05 599.89 A: so
