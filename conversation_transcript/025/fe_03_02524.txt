93.45 106.72 A: [mn] [laughter] yeah i never one one of my friends watched that and i'm like i just i was like oh it's just so shady because it's making fun of all these females you know [laughter] i mean who thought about like get a bunch of guys on there and make them look like fools [mn] 

99.49 103.66 B: [laughter] [laughter] i know

113.75 124.23 A: and i watched the bachelorette with that girl trista but now the new one i just i've had enough i don't want to watch it anymore [laughter] 'cause you just get sucked in after a while and i'm like i'm not even going to watch it so 

119.39 120.65 B: yeah 

123.63 127.00 B: so why do you think they do so well um reality shows 

126.85 137.53 A: (( i guess because people's real life suck and they just uh [laughter] you know i don't know see how stuff [laughter] at times and or see if it's better )) 

130.33 131.62 B: [laughter] 

135.25 148.43 B: i think it's interesting i think it's very interesting because i guess people are always interested in other people's lives and they get to just step away from their own life and just be someone elses life and i guess you 

137.84 138.89 A: yeah 

142.50 143.81 A: mhm 

145.70 147.50 A: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

148.37 161.26 B: know it gets too like comment on someone elses life but it is interesting you know like um i actually want to be in real world but you know i don't think they'd pick me i send in a tape or something but did you ever send in a tape 

159.49 160.71 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

161.19 168.07 A: no you know act- well now i'm actually i'm twenty seven so i'm too i think you have to be like under twenty four now or some- 

166.80 170.36 B: (( i know you have to be like twelve you know [laughter] )) 

168.85 178.17 A: [laughter] i mean they're all like twenty twenty one and i'm just like okay but it's i don't know i know i sound young but um which is i know everybody thinks 

171.72 172.97 B: yeah 

175.38 176.81 B: (( you do )) 

176.83 178.79 B: i was about to say that 

178.81 184.29 A: i know i sound i look young which is really good for when i'm forty i'm sure so but [laughter] 

182.45 185.69 B: yes that is good well lucky you 

184.39 185.34 A: yeah 

185.47 188.30 A: i know yeah so [laughter] but 

186.86 190.35 B: so um do your friends watch um reality shows 

190.39 201.00 A: um yeah see that that's how i got hooked into the bachelor because my um my co-worker we [mn] work in a real small office and me and her we just talked about it like everyday and 

197.31 198.33 B: mhm 

200.78 206.68 A: you know then when the bachelorette came out we at at the beginning we loved it and then after a while we were just like we hated her 'cause 

206.53 215.95 A: you know we're like oh you gotta pick this one and then we're like oh she's so bitchy anyway and i don't know and now i guess they're the only ones that are going to really get married i think so um 

210.54 212.23 B: [laughter] 

215.05 216.13 B: the worse 

215.99 224.60 B: thing is joe millionaire can you imagine these girls thinking they're going to marry some millionaire but you know what i've noticed about these uh these like singles reality shows 

224.43 231.97 B: where they end up marrying i think that's part of the publicity because they end up not working out did you notice like every person that ends up getting 

232.15 237.76 B: hitched or you know end up saying they're going to be together end up breaking it off anyway 

233.69 234.44 A: (( mm )) 

237.86 239.59 A: oh yeah yeah [mn] 

238.40 241.80 B: you know what i mean i mean it's guess because maybe where they live 

241.59 256.20 B: or you know the show's over so the cameras are- aren't around anymore so the real them really show through you know because i think when you have a camera in front of you even though you try to act like yourself you just end up acting a little different 

241.63 242.92 A: mhm 

248.19 249.25 A: mhm 

255.97 257.79 A: exactly yeah 

256.21 264.47 B: um i think the anna nicole smith show is um really funny i like watching that she's c- she's crazy what is she on 

260.59 262.44 A: do you watch that really 

263.20 266.87 A: oh god [laughter] i don't know [laughter] 

264.46 279.25 B: seriously i mean she must be on every medication in the book and i love it how she's so like doesn't care she'll just go on national television on whatever on whatever medication she's on she's crazy and that's why it's fun to watch and the osbournes are fun to watch too 

267.61 268.56 A: (( i know )) 

269.96 270.77 A: i 

272.25 273.11 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

279.72 283.09 A: ye- yeah the osbournes i like that yeah a lot of [mn] 

281.64 289.29 B: do you know that one uh amy one of the dau- daughters actually doesn't want to be shown for whatever reason i think she should because it's good crap 

285.66 287.21 A: yeah 

289.21 292.41 A: yeah exactly i know they're just they're hilarious 

289.37 290.39 B: you know 

290.64 291.43 B: i mean 

292.42 303.58 B: yeah i like i mean i don't know what it is about reality television i guess it's just it's just funny you know you get to you just you get to be a voyeur and you get to look into someone elses 

298.62 299.54 A: yeah 

303.99 305.23 B: (( life you know but )) 

305.06 306.37 A: exactly 

305.30 311.10 B: i don't know how comfortable i really would be if if there was a camera in my face twenty four seven i'm sure i'd be annoyed 

310.80 315.90 A: yeah after a while it was just like oh yeah i'm sure that i don't know that's i guess 

311.13 312.43 B: after a while 

315.73 326.36 A: 'cause even um [mn] i don't know the real world you always whenever they do the editing they they make it [mn] they edit it like it's so it it makes it look one way to be actually a totally different way you know 

320.67 321.82 B: (( exactly )) 

325.65 331.06 B: i wanted to ask you did you hear about the last one in las vegas where um 

331.12 334.31 B: two people move in together did you hear about that 

334.22 338.52 A: oh the um um wh- yeah arelon and elton at the end 

334.47 335.18 B: (( [mn] ))

354.96 357.26 A: yeah i read that in a magazine [laughter] 

356.78 362.00 B: because i didn't get to read i didn't get to see the um reunion so i was a little upset by that 

361.37 363.05 A: oh yeah it was

378.11 381.93 B: so how come they end up ended up living near each other how did that work out 

380.86 391.78 A: because i i think they all were like him and um frank and treselle all went to [mn] um [lipsmack] where they went they went to college out in the same area i think somewhere out in l. a. or something

411.14 412.06 A: (( oh my god )) 

418.09 419.63 A: yeah yeah 

418.56 430.43 B: he's the serious one what happened was um they were going to the m._t._v. studios but they kept the uh whatever the um [lipsmack] detector kept going off and so they were like take your pants off

448.02 449.43 A: oh that is funny 

448.09 451.65 B: i guess that's also a reality show too 'cause it's like you know 

449.86 451.52 A: yeah yeah 

451.88 459.45 B: you know behind the scenes like hiding somewhere but it's it's funny i mean it's it's profitable it's it's good money 

456.14 457.19 A: yeah it's 

459.27 465.26 A: yeah that's [mn] that's probably the main thing about reality shows is they're they are profitable so that's why they're still around [laughter] 

459.69 461.02 B: you know but 

464.43 467.32 B: yeah i mean i it's so weird because um 

467.21 475.86 B: i think survivor how it started they got there that from um that idea from europe i think i think europe started it off with all of this and 

472.99 474.06 A: oh really 

475.70 482.30 B: oh actually talking about uh real world do you know the guy that started real world he put out a movie um a reality

491.00 494.86 A: i don't know i've never yeah i've i've heard of it it looks funny 

494.64 497.96 B: yeah it's based on the same idea i think so 

497.29 499.00 A: oh okay 

498.14 509.65 B: but i'll probably wait until it comes on video [laughter] i don't think i'll i don't think i'll spend i don't know how much it costs like to see a movie in pittsburgh but it costs ten dollars and [mn] that's pretty pricey i think 

500.40 502.25 A: yeah that's a good idea [laughter] 

505.85 506.66 A: oh 

508.60 515.22 A: oh yeah well here most of them are like seven fifty eight dollars but we have like v._i._p. theaters that are that are thirteen fifty 

514.59 518.16 B: wow what what's the v._i._p. theater that's interesting 

516.84 527.82 A: the v._i._p. is like it's like uh leather seats with um it's really nice like there's a lot of and there's like tons of room it's almost like you can like lay if you wanted [laughter] it's just like real comfortable it's 

525.95 530.51 B: wow that's like a bed you could take a nap if you want [laughter] 

528.70 542.98 A: yeah yeah [laughter] pretty much it's at a lowes theater and there's there's i think there's some of those in new york but um they have v._i._p. seating and then you get like some money off of like a meal if you want to eat in their restaurant and stuff too with your thirteen fifty tick- 

541.39 542.98 B: oh wow 

542.81 544.72 A: so it's not too [mn] 

543.35 549.73 B: see that's the cool thing about these um phone calls i learn a lot i talked to this woman about uh the topic was food 

549.60 561.59 B: and she was uh she's from uh north carolina she was just telling me about some restaurants and what they're known for i say yes i have to go there i definitely have to stop by some of those restaurants i wrote it down somewhere i don't know what i wrote but
