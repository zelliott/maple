6.66 8.29 B: i guess so [mn] 

7.70 15.78 A: okay i don't know much about it i mean i've tried to look on the internet and see what it's all about i mean i hardly read the newspapers i don't have time 

15.69 20.91 B: do you listen to anything o- on t._v. at first i couldn't understand they what they were saying 

18.17 19.39 A: no 

20.89 31.70 A: okay the question was what if anything do you both think the u._s. should do about iraq do you think that disarming iraq should be a major priority for the u._s. 

21.78 22.45 B: (( [mn] )) 

26.68 28.02 B: (( oh okay mhm )) 

33.24 44.22 A: all i had was that the u._s. i know they have a firm policy against trading with iraq that the u._s. does however they trade with baghdad through the united nations it's called the oil for food program 

33.33 34.35 B: well 

43.58 48.47 B: right and that's where people are getting ripped off by the regime 

46.70 57.31 A: right and the it said on the internet what i was reading that they believe that even iraq sees saddam hussein as a threat to the middle east because a lot of countries don't wanna trade with them 

56.98 60.93 B: oh i i can understand that [laughter] he was a thief 

61.52 62.60 B: but uh 

63.13 69.42 B: my thing about it is if we want these people to be able to sustain themselves 

69.59 71.12 B: they've gotta do something 

71.26 72.18 A: right 

71.51 73.41 B: you know and 

73.56 77.92 B: uh as long as we we're there i mean everybody there is armed 

78.44 79.27 A: right 

78.46 82.21 B: you know almost every household has guns and weapons 

81.23 83.33 A: guns yeah 

82.63 88.39 B: and i think there should be a general disarmament not just the uh 

88.51 89.43 B: (( you know )) 

89.52 91.62 B: (( the b._a._a._t._h. party and you know )) 

91.63 92.53 A: right 

91.95 94.55 B: the the regime but uh 

94.70 105.56 B: what's left of 'em i just feel that you know the households shouldn't have all those guns they've gotta do something about that but i feel that the people that are gonna be running the country 

106.15 109.09 B: should be in charge of doing that i'm just afraid 

110.19 116.07 B: that the new people are gonna do the same thing because that's the only way they they know 

115.61 116.92 A: how to live yes 

116.51 119.03 B: yeah it's scary 

117.09 118.22 A: yeah 

119.40 120.41 A: that's true 

119.51 120.72 B: and uh 

121.04 130.86 B: i mean these problems the u._s. is having over there right now with you know shooting innocent people is because they're being shot at from where innocent people are at 

125.99 127.04 A: yes 

128.90 129.76 A: first 

130.54 131.68 A: right 

131.03 131.96 B: (( you know )) 

132.06 133.59 B: they've gotta shoot back 

134.50 135.40 B: (( you know )) 

135.12 136.95 A: mhm 

135.51 137.79 B: or just stand there like sitting ducks 

137.14 138.54 A: oh my god 

138.44 145.82 B: yeah so i mean i they really have to do a disarmament program or what do it while they're there i mean they can't do it after they've gone 

146.44 153.12 A: well it says they're returning um inspectors to look for more weapons that they may have hidden and and 

151.78 155.00 B: oh y- they're finding those weapons all over 

153.65 156.27 A: they keep finding more and more and more 

155.99 157.99 B: yeah and the thing is 

158.61 162.89 B: even after disarmament e- even you know after we leave 

162.27 164.83 A: there's probably more that we didn't find 

163.77 166.92 B: i'm worried about children finding 'em you know 

165.89 166.96 A: yeah 

167.80 170.61 B: and you know playing with 'em and 

170.02 170.98 A: right 

170.83 176.75 B: or you know like they talk about the mines the the land mines all over the place 

176.30 177.30 A: right 

177.66 182.29 B: uh i know there's another country that has them all over the place where kids are always getting 

182.45 183.66 B: hurt you know 

183.88 185.79 B: (( i think it's from world war two )) 

185.35 186.39 A: mhm 

186.93 188.64 B: and it scares me 

189.27 192.89 B: i mean i would love to see them become a democracy there 

192.88 193.78 A: right 

194.21 196.66 B: and but you know 

197.10 202.16 B: the country is only as good as the leaders that they you know elected as far as i'm concerned 

203.29 207.16 B: uh i i you know it's up to the people do they want disarmament 

207.11 208.01 A: right 

208.37 209.43 A: i don't know 

208.87 213.48 B: but there is they've lived in such fear for so long they probably don't 

214.33 215.75 A: maybe they don't no 

215.50 216.44 B: (( you know )) 

216.49 217.54 A: mhm 

216.88 218.01 B: uh i 

218.14 224.55 B: i feel it should be up to the their own country i mean i'm concerned for our our boys and and girls over there 

223.68 225.19 A: yeah that they come back 

225.26 226.13 B: yeah 

227.06 228.91 B: so i'd like to see it 

228.95 232.80 B: but after they're gone who knows what's going to happen and that's scary 

233.86 237.36 A: [noise] i have no i have no idea what they're doing [laughter] okay 

237.15 239.84 B: well who you know who really does 

239.49 241.97 A: right i don't think they post everything in the paper 

242.06 244.54 B: of course not and i don't think they should 

242.83 243.73 A: no 

245.31 248.57 B: 'cause when they [noise] do they're telling them as well 

248.58 250.74 A: right yeah yeah 

249.28 252.29 B: [noise] you know they aren't just telling the americans they're [noise] telling 

253.12 257.40 B: telling the protestors and you know the bad guys 

256.73 257.71 A: right 

258.06 269.57 B: so and not everybody over there is pro u._s._a. yet but i think in years to come they'll look back and see that we've you know we did the best we could 

263.49 264.39 A: (( yes )) 

269.20 270.02 A: true 

270.44 274.49 B: with you know that is a highly unusual country 

275.60 276.38 B: (( you know )) 

276.42 278.08 B: as far as uh 

278.35 280.87 B: the way it's been run for twenty five years 

280.49 281.30 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

281.16 283.00 B: and the way the people have lived 

282.64 286.05 A: i never knew they would give oil for food that was like something new 

286.27 289.78 B: oh yeah and the thing is where was all of it going 

289.96 292.24 B: it was going to the regime 

292.54 293.34 A: yes 

292.93 294.78 B: and that is so sad 

294.83 295.67 B: that 

296.11 298.48 B: uh they took so much from their own people 

298.95 299.83 A: right 

300.22 305.14 B: well we're supposed to be talking about disarmament [laughter] i get carried away 

302.33 302.98 A: (( oh )) 

303.41 304.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

305.90 307.36 A: (( well i don't )) 

306.02 308.07 B: where are you li- where do you live 

307.58 309.42 A: i'm in new york queens 

308.49 311.45 B: i'm in california boy we're stretched out 

310.62 313.20 A: yeah i've spoke to a lot of different people on this 

313.13 314.52 B: yeah it's great 

315.10 316.56 B: yeah originally 

315.28 319.56 A: but some the last topic i spoke to was easier but than this is [mn] 

318.94 320.19 B: yeah me too 

320.60 323.97 B: i talked the last person i talked to was in hawaii that was super 

323.70 325.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

324.65 326.21 B: i love hawaii 

325.80 327.03 A: oh [mn] 

327.24 334.44 A: well i think they should make disarming a priority though because you don't want the little kids to find it and everything when you leave 

330.66 331.57 B: yeah 

333.66 338.83 B: right definitely and and like i said we want our men and women to come back 

339.60 340.44 A: yes 

339.68 344.83 B: yeah they're only going to be a lot safer with a lot less people armed over there because 

345.25 349.79 B: you get you know some fanatic in with a group of innocent people 

349.98 350.97 A: right 

350.25 351.52 B: start shooting at 

351.57 352.56 B: (( you know )) 

353.16 355.48 B: at us and we shoot back and 

355.90 359.47 B: all they see is that innocent people have gotten shot 

359.97 360.83 A: right 

360.61 361.54 B: (( you know )) 

361.26 362.32 A: mhm 

361.71 366.91 B: but they they have always hidden behind innocent people and that's how they play the game 

368.36 369.27 B: (( you know )) 

368.98 370.02 A: right 

369.37 372.34 B: they they'll they'll establish themselves in 

372.72 375.47 B: schools and any place else they can 

376.33 381.91 B: 'cause they figure we aren't gonna shoot and that's always been our you know our way of doing things we don't wanna hurt them 

381.69 382.54 A: right 

382.54 386.67 B: but i i'm glad in a sense that they are shooting back 

386.51 388.55 A: yeah they should 

387.51 388.54 B: you know 

389.70 398.41 B: that's why i mean they've just gotta go through buildings and homes and everything and still you're not gonna find them all but gosh you're gonna make a good start 

398.12 399.08 A: right 

399.06 401.87 B: you know and you can't tell them you're gonna start doing this 

401.93 403.71 B: you've just gotta do it 

403.79 405.78 B: widespread quickly 

406.72 407.55 A: (( okay )) 

407.06 407.83 B: (( you know )) 

408.00 413.86 B: and it bothers me that they've brought people home you know ships home and stuff i think they should be there longer 

413.59 414.81 A: (( right mhm )) 

415.02 415.89 B: (( you know )) 

416.33 418.60 B: as we're as we're leaving 

419.18 421.61 B: you know they're feeling braver 

421.79 425.57 A: well since they were looking back on how they um 

426.21 429.98 A: they provided i- in the in the past what they did with the um 

430.33 436.31 A: they said that iraq never fully complied with their earlier resolutions of security council that they never ignored them 

434.32 435.68 B: oh never 

435.96 440.77 B: they've laughed i mean he laughed at us he he made fun of us 

440.43 442.25 A: right 

441.98 443.67 B: because of you know 

444.31 446.81 B: [noise] the uh the uh 

447.07 449.06 B: oh what do you call it the inspectors 

448.72 451.08 A: right they probably were paid off [mn] [laughter] 

449.93 456.23 B: he was on he'd pushes us far and you know as far as he could and then he'd say okay you can do this 

456.59 458.55 B: and they'd go along with it 

457.79 461.36 A: but i still say they have to go on site and look to see 

460.18 461.25 B: yeah 

461.43 463.33 B: yeah and you know 

461.99 464.24 A: instead of relying on somebody else 

464.14 469.52 B: can you imagine the state of new york or the state of california wanting to hide something 

469.51 470.42 A: right 

470.11 472.18 B: no matter how large it was 

473.06 475.14 B: that we would never find it 

474.50 475.95 A: right that's true 

475.72 476.62 B: (( you know )) 

476.93 483.68 B: and so i you know i still believe they've had all that stuff they've hidden it or sent it to another country or whatever 

483.38 491.11 A: well it said in the article i was reading that um you could use like say a facility that was making vaccines could be converted temporarily to do the biological weapons 

490.30 491.63 B: that's right 

492.29 493.74 B: and one of the 

492.32 494.31 A: i it's very strange 

494.06 502.85 B: yeah one of the guys that they caught uh stated that they were either destroyed or hidden just days before we got there 

500.91 501.98 A: right 

503.41 505.82 B: and then another one will say oh we never had 'em 

503.42 504.31 A: mhm 

506.54 510.00 B: [noise] you know because he didn't want to admit his part in it 

506.70 507.58 A: yeah 

509.90 510.91 A: that's true 

510.87 511.67 B: so 

512.12 513.43 A: (( [noise] )) 

512.36 514.98 B: anyways how long are we supposed to talk i forgot 

514.56 518.10 A: ten minutes and then they're gonna they're gonna come on and tell us when it's uh 

515.50 516.38 B: oh 

518.04 521.07 B: oh okay i can't remember it's been a while since i've done one
