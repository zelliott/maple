55.31 61.12 B: um i've done this before i got somebody in another state so who knows this i guess this is random but [laughter] 

57.94 59.82 A: oh okay so i guess 

60.86 65.45 A: can i can i ask you if just as a were you for the war or against it or 

65.29 66.57 B: um

77.29 78.27 A: yeah 

77.63 84.45 B: but also i i feel that whatever needs to get done in order to get things like okay needs to be done as well you know 

82.51 83.35 A: yeah 

84.64 85.94 B: what about you [laughter] 

85.75 93.59 A: i i mean i i was i was against it i i marched in the in the streets and stuff yeah yeah it was great actually it was a really good experience

93.18 94.58 B: oh 

93.73 96.31 A: i mean it's a little weird now you know it's like 

96.33 102.25 A: [laughter] not only did the war not get stopped it it seemed like the war went pretty well for for bush anyway so 

101.58 103.85 B: (( mhm hm )) 

102.57 103.49 A: yeah 

103.87 108.74 A: anyway i don't they they still haven't found any any weapons though which is sort of interesting kinda 

108.01 109.14 B: yeah 

108.78 114.84 A: sort of waiting to see what'll happen with that because i mean i don't know i wonder if anyone will care if you know if they 

115.07 123.03 A: look for six months and never find anything if if people will report it or if i don't know if it'll reflect badly on bush 

117.42 118.69 B: yeah 

122.95 124.72 B: yeah i mean 

123.84 125.67 A: (( what do you i mean what do you think )) 

125.90 127.62 B: i um 

129.07 136.63 B: i don't really know [laughter] i just i'm not like i don't really honestly like i don't really follow this kind of stuff but i mean i did when it 

129.98 131.26 A: [laughter] 

134.88 135.79 A: yeah 

136.50 150.44 B: when you know because i know it's like really important of what's of what's going on so i did at the time and in the beginning and i just i i still can't believe that like saddam hussein has like stunt people or not stunt doubles [lipsmack] regular doubles like 

138.79 139.98 A: (( yeah )) 

149.47 151.92 A: yeah yeah that's funny 

151.01 152.88 B: that's really interesting i mean 

152.67 165.38 A: yeah i think yeah i mean i actually just thought it's very funny like cl- someone had made this like uh turned the that eminem song the the real slim shady into the real saddam will the real saddam please stand up and they had a oh it was funny 

164.56 166.43 B: oh they i haven't heard that 

165.32 169.39 A: they had a little bouncing head doing the karaoke thing which is the real sa- 

168.19 169.04 B: oh 

169.52 170.94 A: yeah i think i mean 

169.57 170.38 B: oh 

171.01 173.48 A: i don't know it it's gonna become like 

173.57 177.67 A: like osama you know another kind of boogey man that no one knows where he is and 

175.80 176.93 B: yeah 

177.04 190.36 B: yeah i just it's just amazing that they seem to get so close but they can't actually capture them you know but then i mean i know that even if they do capture them there's still there's that like other crazy guy in north korea or whatever 

182.59 183.97 A: yeah yeah 

190.08 191.02 A: yeah 

190.45 195.52 B: and there's there still could be you know new people you know that 

195.85 199.65 B: that are can be just as crazy even if they do capture them i guess 

198.14 199.27 A: (( yeah certainly )) 

199.74 202.28 B: you know so who knows um 

202.94 203.92 B: but 

203.70 210.45 A: i don't know do i mean do you think i i i've just been like i feel like they're just going about it all in the wrong way you know it's like th- 

209.83 213.34 B: what do you what do you think that like they should be doing or 

211.72 212.43 A: i 

212.67 225.13 A: i mean well like i i don't know did you hear this that bush made this big speech last night like saying that the war was over pretty much i mean he doesn't say it was over but he said that you know victory has been secured and so 

217.20 218.22 B: no 

224.38 225.71 B: (( oh oh )) 

225.52 234.50 A: and i mean essentially but he also kind of like just said that like the war on terrorism is not over and and you know 

234.73 249.50 A: like anything could happen you know we might have to go to war a- again and again and the war has started but you know it's like he kind of declared war on on [laughter] you know the rest of the world that doesn't agree with us kind of thing it was like very very scary [sigh] um 

246.31 247.36 B: yeah 

248.54 249.59 B: yeah 

249.48 252.20 A: i don't know i just i i just think that that's like 

253.03 267.74 A: like i'm sure there's gonna be you know an iraqi like suicide attack on americans before the end of the year like i'm sure it's like they they they're already they're already like they're still shooting people in iraq like civilians and stuff i mean it's just 

261.50 262.60 B: oh 

264.93 266.08 B: yeah 

267.14 268.27 B: mhm 

268.08 269.78 A: it's pretty bad i don't know 

269.25 272.44 B: yeah i you know i don't really 

272.62 282.06 B: i my dad's uh really into this this type of stuff and he he is for the war actually um because he says well what you know 

274.89 276.00 A: yeah 

278.64 279.43 A: yeah 

282.37 287.63 B: they don't care when they come over here and they do stuff like what's happened you know in uh in new york 

287.24 288.26 A: yeah 

287.65 296.45 B: so you know if if if we need to do some things to get them to realize that we're serious and we're not just gonna be like cowards and not do anything and just let them do whatever they want here 

294.23 294.92 A: but 

295.40 296.19 A: i mean 

296.31 301.25 A: i guess what the the main like sort of thing i i mean what what do they mean by them you know 

301.39 308.95 A: it's like i i feel like everyone associates this iraq thing with with nine eleven but but i mean there were no iraqis involved you know 

305.41 306.53 B: (( oh yeah )) 

308.50 310.06 B: (( y- yeah it's )) 

309.33 323.95 A: i mean i think what people are i mean i not to like say your bad your dad's a bad guy 'cause bush does the exact same thing but like i think when people say them or like you know that iraq is about nine eleven they're just talking about arabs and i can't i can't see that as anything but racism you know 

312.60 314.00 B: (( that's that's all right )) 

323.64 324.58 B: uh-huh 

324.45 328.10 A: i mean i i'm not i that that's just like my interpretation of it but 

327.21 329.13 B: no that's okay that's okay 

328.24 330.30 A: yeah i mean i like you know 

329.62 334.91 B: i think my dad just means like in general with anybody who does things to us yeah 

332.23 333.77 A: like anyone in the world 

334.50 337.79 A: but but iraq never did anything to us you know i 

337.17 344.28 B: i don't know if there was some something else that had that had happened where there was some other like another war or something like that i don't remember what 

343.10 347.42 A: mean there was the first gulf war but that was again like us attacking them 

346.74 347.81 B: yeah 

347.65 361.91 A: so i mean i just i i think that that like what really pissed me off about the whole thing was that it felt like to me that bush was like lying to people again and again like really serious lies about like what iraq had as far as like weapons 

348.35 349.17 B: yeah 

352.74 353.65 B: mhm 

358.25 359.14 B: mhm 

361.81 367.52 A: and that yeah oh yeah they i mean because they kept saying like they brought up they kept bringing things to the u._n. 

362.09 363.07 B: really 

367.51 378.45 A: that like proved to be forgeries like they they brought this um document that that they'd intercepted from nigeria that said that iraq was working on nuclear weapons 

376.03 376.97 B: mhm 

378.26 379.16 B: mhm 

378.42 383.09 A: and they gave it to the u._n. and like within two hours the u._n. had like proved it was a forgery 

382.90 383.81 B: mhm 

383.47 386.59 A: there was another there was another thing where they um [lipsmack] what 

386.75 389.89 A: was it they found a oh yeah they they published this thing 

389.94 399.59 A: like proving all these chemicals weapons iraq had that turned out to be this like fifteen year old like college term paper that someone had written they just like plagiarized it 

397.67 398.40 B: oh 

399.38 408.46 A: this is and this is like our government you know so i i was like pissed off about that and then and then they kept saying like that saddam was tied to al qaeda and it was just not true like 

399.53 400.54 B: oh 

401.26 402.07 B: uh-huh 

408.01 409.60 B: oh 

408.94 415.42 A: like al qaeda kept saying like al qaeda like hates saddam like they're they're like totally different like um 

415.46 419.94 A: [lipsmack] kind of views of things 'cause saddam was totally like secular like not not relig- 

418.94 422.04 B: you do know a lot more about all this stuff than i do [laughter] 

420.25 423.78 A: yeah i've been i've been like kind of a news addict for the last like year or so 

422.53 425.17 B: (( oh you uh how how old are you if you don't mind my asking )) 

424.51 425.87 A: uh twenty six

433.72 434.44 B: no 

435.38 442.97 A: [sigh] i don't know i've i just and this is like you know my hobby [laughter] really not a hobby it's a duty as a citizen i guess 

435.58 436.53 B: (( i don't )) 

439.38 440.36 B: yeah 

442.70 447.80 B: yeah i know i mean once once in a while i mean i will tune into the news but i 

447.59 448.70 A: yeah 

448.13 452.28 B: news for me it just like so it makes me paranoid 

451.87 452.90 A: yeah 

452.32 453.84 B: like my dad though he 

452.95 456.68 A: oh it's really the more you read the more kind of crazy it makes you i think 

455.93 466.84 B: yeah my dad though i mean i know if there's important my dad he watches he's excited about the news like every night gotta watch the ten o'clock news gotta watch the eleven o'clock news and he'll watch the news and you know but 

461.22 461.97 A: yeah 

463.47 464.32 A: yeah 

466.87 472.75 A: that that's actually something that's i mean i i was like so angry with all this you know it s- seemed like ever there are these like 

466.99 467.81 B: (( i don't know )) 

472.96 484.63 A: basic untruths to me i don't know it just seemed like there are these really like untrue things that kept happening so i was like why aren't people why why are people continually convinced by this and i i don't have a television i went i went to like 

482.16 482.97 B: mhm 

484.63 498.53 A: visit my sister at one point and we watched a lot of t._v. and i think it really is like the the big media companies just were like pushing it you know every time they thought they'd found a weapon of mass destruction like during the war they'd like there'd be this huge news story da da da what are these things 

494.50 495.40 B: (( mhm )) 

497.04 497.72 B: it 

498.23 499.39 B: right 

498.31 506.14 A: every time like within a day they'd they'd find out it was wrong it was like aspirin or something like that but they wouldn't report that so it's like i i mean 

502.99 503.99 B: yeah 

505.24 506.19 B: oh 

506.18 509.04 A: i mean i think that don't you think that's kind of like biased 

508.76 512.34 B: yeah yeah i i agree 

509.52 510.32 A: yeah 

510.99 511.83 A: i know 

511.96 513.70 A: yeah i mean a lot of you know 

513.73 517.74 A: i don't know i mean i think that's i mean most of the people in this country supported the war 

517.88 520.61 A: and i that's i kinda think that's why it's just they've they 

520.77 522.43 A: haven't gotten really 

522.77 524.33 A: accurate information 

524.13 525.12 B: yeah 

525.22 527.99 B: you're prob- i i think you're right i mean 

525.48 526.30 A: (( i don't know )) 

527.70 528.62 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

528.06 533.50 B: i think if more people could know a lot a lot of these things that yeah i don't know [sigh] 

533.86 535.09 B: but 

534.30 538.24 A: [sigh] who knows well we'll see what happens next i guess it's gonna be 

537.25 538.22 B: yeah 

538.30 539.66 A: interesting uh 

540.01 543.70 A: interesting year probably till the next elections

545.85 546.84 A: (( don't know )) 

547.64 555.88 A: i bet i mean i i i hope like things work out for the iraqis you know what i mean s- saddam was definitely like a bad dude you know 

555.61 556.78 B: (( mhm )) 

556.45 559.67 A: and uh yeah hopefully they'll be better off 

560.30 564.28 A: just having had a few thousand of their people killed and uh uh 

564.29 567.32 A: however many sam- saddam would have killed and [laughter]
