8.75 11.43 B: so reality t._v. do you watch it 

10.35 11.18 A: ah 

11.35 16.88 A: yeah i do watch it i watch a lot of it and it's kind of sick [laughter] yeah well 

14.50 16.74 B: really [laughter] okay 

17.04 18.13 A: what about you 

17.07 21.04 B: well that's a good match up because i don't i don't watch too much of it myself [laughter] 

20.83 25.13 A: (( no [laughter] i don't see why [noise] )) 

21.70 27.82 B: no um i don't even know that it's necessarily i have watched i guess i've caught little parts of it before but 

27.91 33.62 B: nothing i don't think i've ever watched a full no i have i've watched that one where the people go on the cruise together 

33.76 42.27 A: oh really i don't think i saw that one but i i do watch a lot of the bachelor and the bachelorette and i watched joe millionaire when joe millionaire was on 

36.18 37.00 B: [laughter] 

42.10 43.38 B: yeah 

42.83 55.28 A: yeah i think it's kind of cool [noise] because it's funny 'cause i mean it's kind of like real life but it it's on t._v. and i mean it's other people's lives and why do we care but everyone just seems to be so addicted to it like 

47.93 48.90 B: uh-huh 

54.72 56.38 B: yeah definitely 

55.98 60.21 A: it's funny like do you you you don't watch um sorority life and fraternity life 

60.06 74.40 B: no i don't i like i don't get that many t._v. channels at my house 'cause we don't have cable but i've caught little parts of it i can't i mean when it fir- when reality t._v. first started out when do you think it started maybe like two years ago or something it started getting really 

64.44 66.16 A: (( [noise] oh really )) 

73.17 75.63 A: um i think it started with like survivor 

75.90 78.03 B: yeah i think it started with survivor too 

77.48 79.62 A: yeah [noise] um um 

78.73 80.22 B: but when was that 

80.30 83.44 A: that was something like three or four years ago 

83.28 86.65 B: that started and also what was that other one like big brother or something 

86.32 90.23 A: big brother and then and then um who wants to marry a millionaire 

86.71 87.58 B: or 

90.08 94.21 B: but you know what i think actually was probably the one that started all of it was the real world right 

94.01 98.23 A: oh yeah the real world obviously that's like the fir- the real world is really old 

98.05 100.13 B: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah )) 

98.60 107.34 A: they were the first ones those are my favorite [laughter] like i don't even think of those as reality t._v. any more 'cause they've been around for like ten years [laughter] 

101.02 103.05 B: [laughter] i've watched 

106.86 118.65 B: a couple of them i i guess like the part part of it that doesn't keep my attention is that it seems very contrived you know like they try and elicit certain reactions from people just so to make it entertaining 

113.75 114.82 A: yeah 

118.10 128.97 A: exactly and you know what it's funny 'cause with the real world they definitely do that like the real world like some of the cast came to my school and they were just talking about their show and how that ah they 

125.07 126.04 B: really 

128.91 138.28 A: like they would show someone crying but it wouldn't be about the topic they were discussing it was about something completely different so they kind of like fabricate a lot of it like a lot of it like 

134.81 136.19 B: oh really 

137.30 138.34 B: oh 

138.29 146.88 A: they kind of make it seem worse than it actually is but i think with like the the bachelorette and like the bachelor and like all those shows are kind of more like 

140.97 142.28 B: yeah 

147.09 150.35 A: they're real like you can't really fake that so i don't know i 

149.45 151.47 B: yeah yeah 

150.49 155.58 A: don't know i always find myself watching that and like sorority life and fraternity life 

154.40 160.70 B: [laughter] it kind of weirds me out but if it's on i would definitely watch it but i saw this commercial for this one 

156.06 157.16 A: (( i don't know )) 

160.48 163.87 B: that really really unnerved me where 

163.66 165.29 B: i don't know if you've seen it but 

165.11 178.96 B: it's basically this guy is set up with a bunch of different women to go on different dates and they're trying to make him fall in love with them and he thinks that the premise of the show is to find true love but the real reason is that the winner gets like a million dollars or something like that 

177.96 183.10 A: oh i think i did hear something about i had an i don't know if it's on yet i haven't seen it 

182.45 190.20 B: ah but this poor guy thinks that these women are trying to sell themselves to him because they they wanna find true love and really they just want money it's so horrible 

185.16 185.85 A: (( [laughter] )) 

189.72 196.73 A: yeah that's exactly how like joe millionaire was that i loved the show even though i could not stand joe millionaire i just wanted to see these 

193.46 195.66 B: [laughter] 

196.64 202.11 A: i just wanted to see these girls and how they reacted and like the one girl i remember with the last two girls 

201.98 216.14 A: the the one that won actually was the one that was more like i never grew up with money and it wasn't like a big deal for her but the other girl was all like disappointed when like if she didn't win because she wanted the money and that's all she was about it was so funny 

215.86 217.83 B: [laughter] 

216.45 219.30 A: [mn] it's so great [laughter] 

218.10 220.02 B: (( but yeah i mean i guess there's )) 

219.84 230.36 B: when when that it said that the topic was reality t._v. i was kind of like oh i don't know that much about it but i'll i'll try you know and then my my first gut reaction was oh something about it just bothers me i think it's kind of gross but then 

225.10 226.83 A: yeah yeah 

230.16 240.58 B: you know like as we're talking about it i'm thinking if it was on in front of me right now i'd probably be all over all and i told how i watched the cruise show and it was so bad and so stupid but i could not stop watching it 

236.48 237.81 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

239.89 242.59 A: i know it's so funny um 

242.68 250.48 A: ah what was the other show oh oh the worst one of all which like really made me angry was um what was it like 

250.49 253.40 A: who has the best body or something like 

253.64 259.79 A: oh i forget what the name of it was but like they would get up these people would get up on stage and they would have these judges 

259.60 269.90 A: like judge they way they looked and like pick out every little thing that was wrong with them and honestly there's nothing wrong with these people and like who's to say that they're ugly when 

266.98 268.45 B: (( mhm )) 

269.83 278.98 A: you know what i mean like who are they to it's so horrible like that made me so angry and there's like another [laughter] there's another one like all american girl 

271.06 272.57 B: it's horrible 

274.91 276.15 B: (( they're like )) 

279.43 286.25 A: like who's to say that this person's gonna be the all american girl like what exactly does that mean [laughter] 

279.63 280.76 B: oh 

283.05 284.29 B: (( yeah )) 

285.35 291.62 B: totally exactly like what what what do you think were like traits or values did they pick out that would be like all american 

291.37 296.07 A: i don't know like they all wear red white and blue on the show [laughter] 

294.49 297.43 B: (( [laughter] )) 

296.43 300.10 A: it looked ridiculous [laughter] like was that 

298.86 307.23 B: i suppose the other one that they're doing like america's most talented kid and it just makes me feel like oh my god what are you doing to these kids so sad 

306.02 317.26 A: yeah you can't you can't possible say it's america's most talented kid when there's like a million kids in this country and you haven't looked at 'em all so [laughter] i don't know it's it's ridiculous 

315.26 328.64 B: yeah but i i just think it's like sad the way that they're conditioning them already like to get you know like most of 'em are gonna get shot down obviously because who's gonna be america's you know they're probably there's probably so many of them are shot down even before the show even started and i don't know it's so sad 

322.04 323.24 A: (( oh yeah )) 

328.00 333.03 A: yeah yeah and i think like a majority of the t._v. is reality t._v. now 

333.06 334.69 B: yeah it really is 

333.09 338.29 A: like i i think of shows of the type like friends that i watch that isn't like reality t._v. 

338.41 339.27 B: (( mm )) 

338.70 342.88 A: and i used to hate it and like this is so stupid but i i that's all i watch 

343.24 346.35 B: [laughter] so why do you think 

343.29 344.96 A: that's all i watch [laughter] 

345.11 346.62 A: (( i don't know why i )) 

346.44 348.07 B: so why do you think it's so popular 

348.01 350.54 A: don't know i don't know i think it's 

350.48 364.13 A: it's because a lot of people probably can relate to things on the real world and they see that other people go through them and they're like all right that's kind of cool you know what i mean but i think it's 'cause it's a real life situation people are more interested like 

354.26 355.50 B: (( mhm )) 

360.05 361.02 B: yeah 

364.12 375.58 A: rather than like t._v. shows that don't really that aren't real like people are just like well that's that's never gonna happen but you see these things happen on the real world and road rules and all those shows so 

374.31 383.66 B: except that like you said like they try i guess like sitcoms like recreate real life situations and kind of magnify them to make them more funny or more dramatic or whatever 

382.31 383.78 A: definitely definitely 

383.59 394.37 B: and then reality t._v. tries to make it more like okay this is really more like real life but just like you said how they show that they're would get filmed when they're crying about something else you know and then they pop it in like 

392.78 399.20 A: yeah yeah but but yeah but you would never know that unless like they didn't tell me that you know what i mean so like [laughter] 

396.03 396.99 B: right 

398.03 399.55 B: right right 

399.23 401.87 A: make people think that it's real and they're like 

402.10 410.25 A: oh my gosh they're going through all this stuff and and i don't know i think it's it's crazy and that new movie um that cancun movie it 

410.29 411.83 B: i don't know what is it 

411.24 423.87 A: it's um it's made by the producers of re- ah real world um it's i think it's called real cancun or something where they pick like ten kids to go to cancun and they like videotaped everything 

415.50 416.30 B: uh-huh 

418.97 420.34 B: [laughter] 

423.98 425.67 B: (( oh my god )) 

424.04 432.14 A: and they like just made it into a movie apparently it like flopped because like like it just seemed so stupid like you could turn the t._v. on and watch the same thing 

432.07 433.24 B: yeah 

432.45 442.67 A: but oh man i was talking to my roommate about it and i was like you know what we should've totally done that i would've gone and sat on the beach and [laughter] so funny [laughter] 

439.53 441.02 B: (( [laughter] )) 

441.53 456.14 B: i guess like maybe reality t._v. has the same kind of like pull as like when people you know it's like maybe for friends for example or whatever you watch them on t._v. and you have a you generate an idea of what you think they're they're really like in life you know because you see them so much and you feel acquainted with them but then 

453.59 454.62 A: yeah 

455.95 467.18 B: like if you hear some sort of like tabloid thing or you want to read people magazine or whatever you can find out what they're really like or whatever and how it like people on t._v. are like you know you suppose in reality t._v. they're not acting they're just 

461.68 462.95 A: exactly 

467.06 480.53 B: really like being themselves although i don't think they're really being themselves they have a camera following them around i mean at some point they get comfortable with it but i'm sure they tell them like okay now we're gonna set up this scene how do you feel about it you know like okay we want to you to be upset or you know 

471.20 473.29 A: (( yeah exactly who )) 

480.46 486.66 B: like that's not gonna be amusing for people to see so you have to get really have a dramatic cry right now or something 

480.55 481.52 A: yeah 

485.92 488.40 A: exactly exactly i think that like 

488.27 501.18 A: okay i'm sure it's not completely real because people totally change in front of a camera like who wouldn't you're gonna be on national t._v. like why would you act like all you want is money from somebody or why would you act like an idiot you know like 

493.71 495.40 B: yeah of course 

500.47 501.61 B: yeah 

501.36 509.96 A: people i think do change a lot when like the camera's turned on but i i don't think like most of the people that watch t._v. realize that like that it's not all 

504.77 505.90 B: yeah 

509.87 517.53 A: real probably it's like a lot of it's more fabricated but using like real footage and real people crying you know what i mean so 

515.09 515.94 B: right 

516.68 518.28 B: right right 

517.44 526.53 A: i don't know i i think it's crazy and i don't know why it's so popular i just it everybody watches it and it it's gotten way out of hand with all like the um 

526.66 527.78 A: the 

528.04 529.62 A: what's it called the 

530.42 532.88 A: all american girl and like the 

532.94 537.83 A: world's whatever most talented kid like that's crazy [laughter] 

536.98 546.49 B: yeah yeah i don't know is t- yeah i think it has a feeling of being unnerved by it but knowing full well that i would watch every second of it if it was in front of me [laughter] [laughter] 

544.54 552.29 A: i know i know exactly and it's so weird like i hate it like i hate a lot of it but i just watch it because it's so funny i like to see how 

552.28 563.63 A: real people like act on t._v. i don't know 'cause if you don't really like we never saw that ten years ago like we were like what what's that [laughter] what's that like 

556.23 557.49 B: yeah 

559.87 561.17 B: right right 

562.06 567.87 B: right yeah and then real world like as soon as the real world was invented it was like super popular i know people who are always asking 

567.68 580.95 B: oh did you ever see the real world when they're in such and such location it was like real world seventy five and i was like i don't know [laughter] and the people on it become like stars you know oh i saw that person from real world or it was filmed here or whatever it's weird 

571.64 575.13 A: yeah i know i know it's crazy 

578.14 579.64 A: yeah 

580.24 589.18 A: it's so weird 'cause it they're just real people that that were on t._v. and people are like oh these people were on tv they're famous [laughter] that's just real life 

582.73 583.72 B: yeah 

586.92 587.85 B: (( [laughter] do )) 

587.92 594.92 B: we [mn] what were what were the questions we were supposed to answer exactly like do you watch it and why is it popular 

591.41 597.06 A: um i think it was oh yeah do we watch it why is it popular and um 

597.42 598.96 A: (( ah [mn] )) 

599.20 599.89 A: just what sho-
