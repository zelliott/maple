218.82 219.95 A: the dirt 

222.40 223.23 A: money yeah 

231.23 241.51 A: i think the challenge to see what people's fears are for me because it's it's like for me it's like um being like trapped underwater or something is like a fear for me and it's 

235.05 236.03 B: yeah 

240.39 241.46 B: oh god 

241.31 247.02 A: kind of like seeing what kind of stunts they make these people do or how crazy people will go 

246.89 248.40 B: exactly 

247.52 250.73 A: i mean it's like okay fine i mean i've seen 

251.04 262.20 A: some weird stuff in my time i used to be a police officer and i was a vet tech and i've seen some weird stuff from dead bodies all the way into maggots on animals and they actually had somebody eating cheese that had maggots in it 

257.24 257.91 B: (( how )) 

261.94 265.03 B: [mn] [sigh] oh man i don't know 

263.33 273.25 A: and i looked at that and i had to leave the room i was like that's it i'm turning it off i have to leave the room i didn't even wanna and and my husband's over there turning it on he goes come here look at this i'm like no 

273.07 275.39 B: is it like no don't need to see that 

273.27 288.23 A: i said i'm sorry i draw the line when it comes down to maggots and stuff like that i mean i don't care if somebody wants to eat a grasshopper or an ant far be it from me for them to be organic you know that's fine for me but they actually had them eating some rotten cheese with maggots in it and i said oh i can't watch this anymore 

277.05 278.18 B: i know 

287.49 291.02 B: oh my god that oh god i'd be ill 

288.79 297.30 A: yeah i like to see what these people will try i mean it's amazing what people will do i mean here we're doing surveys and they're like doing all these weird 

294.06 294.79 B: i 

296.41 299.54 B: [laughter] 

298.22 300.76 A: weird survivalist stunts you know 

300.88 307.93 B: i was gonna say i think ours are like what'd be our way of doing of of surviving i think is it's a lot more pleasant [laughter] 

306.99 309.35 A: it is it is it's a 

307.98 317.93 B: i mean i can watch people on survivor and admire them for what they do but i in a way i guess it's sort of that voyeur factor there i know i i i could never do that i couldn't 

317.49 321.46 A: i'd be out there scoping all the animals saying come home with me come home 

321.24 323.15 B: [laughter] 

321.27 334.18 A: my husband goes well look you'd go there and you'd bring home a python and you know a boa and 'cause we have animals and everything and you know i watch like um the well i don't know if it's considered reality t._v. but i watch like the animal planet 

334.08 346.48 A: and i watch um like geoff horwin and stuff like that but i guess that's not really reality tv 'cause i just wanna see what's going on like with exotic pets and all the rest of it but or um what's the other one ah animal cops 

337.35 338.40 B: yeah 

346.50 347.86 B: animal cops would 

346.58 353.72 A: that's kind of cool to see cops going out there rescuing animals it started out in new york and now detroit and detroit's got a really bad 

353.73 361.54 A: problem with over- ah overpopulation of animals and they show the cops go out and actually cite people for doing stupid things to their animals 

356.44 357.55 B: (( be one oh boy )) 

361.77 363.33 A: which is kind of cool 

361.94 374.63 B: you see that kind of a reality show like that and like cops you know something that really seems like real reality i like i like shows like that because it's co- it's close enough to regular life 

366.60 367.78 A: yeah 

373.93 384.97 A: oh yeah now 'cause like with cops when we drove through tampa i saw i saw tampa on t._v. on cops we drove through tampa and i went holy god everybody lock the doors it's just like on t._v. so yeah cops 

374.57 377.56 B: now when i see people like the the bachelorette and 

379.31 380.22 B: yeah 

383.86 386.70 B: [laughter] i know 

386.46 396.82 A: is kind of i like cops because i mean it reminds me of my days when i used to chase the bad guys and i always sit there and like watch him watch him he's gonna run and my husband's like you're not on the job anymore it's like he's gonna run [laughter] 

395.77 398.98 B: and you're like i can see it in his eyes [laughter] 

397.74 404.76 A: [laughter] oh now that's not bad i i don't know i think fear factor's gone a little 

405.10 414.81 A: i think they've gone a little too far i don't mind seeing people do things from heights and i don't mind seeing people do some funky things but some of that stuff that they're doing is really it's gross 

408.97 409.87 B: yeah 

413.96 416.96 B: it's just over the top and i you know when they 

415.40 422.31 A: they had them picking up dead rats with their mouths and mouth full of worms and i got a four year old uh-huh 

417.91 418.87 B: oh 

420.47 432.53 B: you know i i think that these reality shows are really pushing themselves like i think they're burning themselves out because they're getting so extreme that people like oh good lord this is another some crazy show i 

431.35 433.69 A: (( well look at that theatrical one that guy lied )) 

433.44 434.17 B: (( know )) 

434.16 440.41 A: he lied about who he was it's like are you so stupid did you need rating that bad [laughter] 

437.98 438.75 B: i 

440.75 454.84 B: [laughter] i know i know that's it it's getting pathetic you know it's like it gives an excuse for thinking up of more rather than thinking up more intelligent programming or being more crea- just trying to they're beating the formula to death [laughter] 

453.77 459.01 A: did you hear they're gonna make they're talking about making a cable station where it's reality t._v. twenty four seven 

459.08 462.00 B: oh give me a break [laughter] 

461.17 466.37 A: i heard it on either the radio or i gu- it had to be on the radio 

462.19 462.92 B: (( oh )) 

466.42 474.56 A: that they were saying they were gonna make reality t._v. one like a game show thing of twenty four seven i was like okay that's gonna they burn out real quick 

466.60 467.51 B: (( but they )) 

474.30 485.13 B: but you know what though that is a great idea because then it'll draw all those shows off the other cha- off the other networks and then you've only [laughter] got one place to get it [laughter] 

480.51 490.57 A: [laughter] that is good i didn't think of it that way [laughter] open it up for some other programming like c._s._i. and all that other good stuff or any anything i mean i 

487.81 488.85 B: yeah 

490.38 500.67 A: if and my little guy who's four wants to watch fear factor he's like mom can we watch that i like to hear people scream it's like no you you know you're like getting into this charles manson thing 

491.44 492.16 B: (( [laughter] )) 

498.79 500.02 B: oh god 

500.80 508.01 A: you know and he thinks it's funny because you know when his when jim is home or like we watch we used to watch wrestling because some friends of ours were 

508.09 517.42 A: ah professional wrestlers so we used to watch it when he was real real little well we don't let him watch it at all and he wants to know why he can't watch it because uncle so and so's on t._v. and it's like no 

512.15 513.17 B: yeah 

513.64 514.74 B: yeah 

517.83 524.58 A: because i know that that's really sometimes they really get hurt and they do cut themselves and they do stupid things 

517.90 519.00 B: oh boy 

521.86 522.84 B: yeah 

525.04 532.65 A: but yeah i mean it it's weird how different categories fall in i wonder if news is considered reality t._v. 

532.63 538.30 B: boy sometimes it's too much i was just saying i was getting my hair cut yesterday and we were having this whole discussion 

538.14 544.47 B: and everyone with saddam most most of them don't wanna watch the news because it's so upsetting depressing 

544.31 553.36 B: that they just wanna shut it out of their lives unless it's something that they really really need to know about you know like an epidemic like sars or something like that or 

551.35 552.55 A: yeah 

552.65 559.14 A: yeah well we're in chicago here and and tonight they had six people get shot by an ak47 in maywood 

559.18 561.01 B: oh god 

559.20 568.40 A: and that's just about ten minutes down the road from me because i'm on the outskirts of chicago and i go to school right on the verge of maywood which is over in rivergrove and i'm like oh that's nice 

567.54 571.07 B: oh my god oh terrifying 

568.68 573.01 A: lots of gang activity and stuff like that i mean i don't know what area you're from but 

572.65 574.94 B: i'm i'm in san francisco 

574.45 577.36 A: oh it's beautiful out there 

577.13 583.81 B: yeah i like it i like chicago too i've been there it's like chicago is fun [laughter] 

579.40 582.59 A: i'll switch [laughter] 

582.60 596.94 A: i think they should make something about reality t._v. for like out on the west coast i would gladly go [laughter] i don't think i would eat the maggots and stuff like that but i think i would really go it's like you wanna swim a whale okay i'll go you know what the hell 

588.09 590.89 B: [laughter] 

595.40 599.89 B: (( [laughter] well see there you go that's the kind of reality t._v. they should have ))
