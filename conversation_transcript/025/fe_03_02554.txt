142.26 155.04 B: um and did was there any sense of that when you watched these shows or was there anything redeeming about it at all or was it just completely one hundred percent garbage in your opinion

166.43 172.12 A: i didn't like 'em but obviously i'm in the minority because they're on because millions of people watch them and like them 

172.51 173.92 A: and i think 

174.60 184.47 A: the friends that i have that watch them faithfully have kind of boring lives and so i think for them that's kind of living life vicariously 

179.70 180.76 B: (( mm )) 

184.12 185.22 B: mhm 

184.58 190.70 A: you know through other people's adventures and other people's excitement [noise] which is valid you know there's a place 

190.90 192.92 A: um it's just 

193.77 195.65 A: um watching 

195.72 202.81 A: women who ah if this if everybody knew this guy were truly a construction worker and made two thousand a month they wouldn't give him the time of day

216.85 221.41 A: perfect people and i just think it's a a sad comment um 

221.69 224.13 A: my goal is to be a psychologist so maybe i 

224.38 227.45 A: i i look more deeply into it than i should 

227.49 241.35 B: mm no no no ah ah i don't think y- i mean each person sees it their own way um so you think it's this kind of vicarious aspect that makes it the shows are [mn] we can't dispute it they're popular they are very popular 

232.89 234.37 A: right right 

241.29 244.76 B: do you think it's because of this this vicarious aspect 

241.30 242.72 A: they're very popular 

244.76 250.30 A: well i think with my friend it's certainly like it it it's [noise] it's the vicariousness because you know 

250.35 252.59 A: they have average lives and 

252.82 261.51 A: have average ah average jobs and instead of appreciating what they do have it's just that vicariously enjoying somebody else's excitement and somebody else's 

261.63 263.42 A: fabulous life 

263.87 266.58 A: and i suppose you know every many women 

266.70 268.83 A: dream of having a joe millionaire 

269.26 274.04 A: fiance i just think it it it i mean um 

275.15 282.02 A: you're you're right [mn] it's on because everybody watches it but i'm one of the few that doesn't like it 

282.30 283.29 B: um 

283.37 292.32 B: i once heard they were [mn] it was i don't know like on a sixty minutes type thing or twenty twenty and the subject was 

289.57 290.83 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

292.25 301.36 B: soap operas not reality tv and they were actually talking to people who live they were like college grad students and 

293.66 294.26 A: (( yeah )) 

295.06 295.94 A: okay 

301.24 309.43 B: the college grad student yes said yeah i admit i watch general hospital or what is it you know i don't know those those shows were called 

306.06 307.06 A: yeah 

307.77 308.72 A: yeah 

309.20 318.56 B: and the person said to her you know you're you're an intelligent young lady w- why do you watch general hospital and she said 

312.95 313.55 A: (( yeah )) 

318.33 332.89 B: and i thought it was a pretty good answer she said i have problems in my life but then when i see these problems that they have on general hospital my problems just become like minuscule and and you know it 

320.65 321.57 A: yeah 

324.21 324.95 A: (( ha )) 

330.36 331.77 A: [sigh] 

332.25 333.62 A: [sigh] 

332.79 345.90 B: gives me it puts everything into perspective of course she's comparing herself to a fantasy to a made up thing and i think that's kind of why i think like a survivor type show is 

334.24 335.79 A: (( [sigh] right [noise] )) 

336.23 337.76 A: (( [sigh] )) 

338.55 340.07 A: (( right then you know they )) 

340.58 342.87 A: (( can kind of escape that ))

360.88 362.80 A: (( that show right [noise] )) 

362.48 368.18 B: makes their own life their own life's problems seem very small and minute and 

366.62 369.10 A: (( you know and )) 

368.26 369.75 B: insignificant 

370.25 371.38 A: (( of course )) 

371.94 373.57 A: we're all drawn to 

374.03 376.12 A: instant gratification and 

376.37 378.53 A: you know um you 

378.68 383.49 A: eat all of these termites in fifteen seconds and you win fifty thousand dollars 

383.04 384.33 B: [laughter]

387.99 388.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

389.05 394.59 A: and i think most of us most people are average and have average lives but instead of [noise] 

394.83 398.02 A: appreciating ah what's remarkable in our own lives 

398.12 400.82 A: you know we dream of having the perfect [noise] 

400.89 403.67 A: woman or the joe millionaire 

403.76 413.11 A: [noise] boyfriend and you know i think that's just human nature [noise] to envy what we don't have and don't appreciate what we what we do have [noise] 

413.22 414.14 A: um 

414.48 415.45 B: you know 

414.52 415.29 A: (( and it ))

431.30 432.14 A: right 

432.17 433.37 A: (( right right )) 

432.81 434.67 B: you think people

474.78 480.29 A: at um k._f._c. all day you know as a meat wrapper and then yo come home and here are these 

481.22 490.67 A: [noise] fantasy lives but they're you know they're interesting and and people are becoming wealthy and people are marrying [noise] handsome millionaires and i just think it's 

491.18 494.02 A: it's escape to you know 

494.43 498.89 A: it's escape to to um get away from ones 

499.03 505.23 A: the averageness the monotony in one's life which we all have to deal with monotony in our own way and i prefer you know 

505.58 508.47 A: reading books and meeting interesting people and 

508.53 514.97 A: ah other people like most of my friends enjoy watching all of these t._v. shows [noise] 

515.54 519.36 A: and then they have things to talk about and they talk about it among their friends [noise] 

515.68 516.38 B: but 

520.26 530.22 B: here here's a another thing that i just thought of um this was several ye- probably three years ago i was talking to this ah friend and this friend had lived in japan 

522.88 524.05 A: yeah 

528.10 529.23 A: mhm 

530.07 531.12 A: okay 

530.48 533.92 B: and he described a show on japanese t._v. 

533.95 541.67 B: which was just like fear factor where they make people do all sorts of you know you know lie in a pit of snakes [mn] 

538.85 539.68 A: yeah 

540.71 542.03 A: yeah 

542.18 550.14 B: and i thought my god what are the japanese people thinking you know that would never make it here in the u._s. and 

548.15 548.92 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

550.18 554.01 B: lo and behold three years later it is but my point being 

555.19 562.54 B: if the show really originated in japan and i don't have any reason to doubt my friend was telling me the truth it's not just an american 

560.25 561.28 A: (( right )) 

562.17 563.40 A: good point 

563.05 564.88 B: phenomenon it's ah 

564.05 565.81 A: (( good point yeah )) 

565.08 567.65 B: at least in japan too 

567.39 568.80 A: yeah 

569.25 570.99 A: [noise] that's a good point 

571.23 574.11 A: well and and again you know 

574.24 576.33 A: that's the japanese culture where 

576.60 581.06 A: having to fit in and having you know to [noise] 

581.17 588.24 A: i just just from a limited [noise] knowledge i have of that culture [mn] a couple of friends and um [noise] 

588.39 589.57 A: i just think 

590.39 593.95 A: [noise] [sigh] just to remove ourselves from our own 

594.02 599.95 A: lives that we might not think are very exciting you know 'cause you go to the same job every day and you 

599.20 599.89 B: mhm
