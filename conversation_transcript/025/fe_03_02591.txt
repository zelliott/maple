0.22 1.94 A: hi i'm charlie 

0.25 1.35 B: (( hello )) 

1.48 4.62 B: hi i'm chris how are you doing today 

4.80 7.52 A: good how are you doing 

5.46 7.89 B: [mn] good your first call 

7.81 10.86 A: uh y- second 

9.43 11.60 B: second it's my second too [mn] 

11.35 15.02 A: yeah this seems like a very outdated uh topic 

14.59 19.58 B: it really does doesn't it seems like we've already made the decision of what we're gonna do [mn] 

19.18 21.56 A: yes exactly 

20.99 24.17 B: oh uh well i guess 

23.03 27.66 A: i guess it was a good thing disarming iraq but it looks like there wasn't anything to disarm 

27.15 36.92 B: that's the uh f- funny part i was talking to these people today about that is uh they keep looking for these weapons of mass destruction that we uh haven't produced or placed any over there yet 

36.67 40.93 A: yeah i keep hearing about how they found scientists that keep saying how 

40.94 46.41 A: they have nothing to lose you know and they keep saying how there is nothing there they'd already destroyed everything they'd had [noise] [mn] [noise] 

45.75 53.05 B: right but they seem to um uh the american public doesn't really seem to care i mean 

53.24 65.94 B: you would think somebody's head would be on the chopping block because we've uh uh done this because of the weapons of mass destruction they haven't produced any and uh we don't you know it seems like the general public's never really got upset about it 

65.33 72.53 A: i think it's 'cause the general public realizes that we didn't really go in there for weapons of mass destruction we just went in there because we don't like saddam hussein 

72.42 85.65 A: so i think the general public you know they got rid of saddam hussein and everyone knew that was the main goal whether there were weapons of mass destruction or not so i don't think the general public really cares about their smoke screen tactic and kinda just knows what the real deal was 

77.93 78.54 B: (( [noise] )) 

85.01 89.36 B: [mn] [noise] [mn] pretty sad that that's how they sold the war though uh i- 

88.40 89.40 A: yeah 

89.46 100.35 B: it really i guess i get i i've been uh strong on the other side i've been against the war ever since it started and ever since the threat of it and i don't understand uh 

89.87 90.87 A: i don't know 

96.58 98.27 A: yeah 

100.32 108.67 B: all these people that justified it everyone that i spoke to justified the war that saddam was a horrible person and he had weapons of mass destruction and that when i ask 'em [noise] [noise] [noise] 

106.64 116.90 A: well see the weapons of mass destruction thing that was just a that was just what they told the sheep but i mean everyone knows the guy was a wasn't a very g- it wasn't like the guy's a good leader and he was 

116.71 124.70 A: i mean he was a threat to us i'm not gonna act like he was a very imminent threat that guy in north korea's even worse but [noise] i mean 

124.63 136.45 A: and i think it was about time saddam left but i just wish they'd come out and just said that instead of trying to come up with all these political things to say reasons why i wish they'd just come out and said you know 

136.22 137.83 B: but the pr- 

136.70 142.35 A: saddam hussein's a horrible leader we're removing him from power and then we'll leave i i don't know 

141.17 155.04 B: [cough] that's the problem now we're not now we're not gonna leave i don't feel like we're going to be out of there in in any short time time frame and we never installed a government in any country that's been productive um after you know after we went in 

153.16 154.40 A: yeah that's true 

154.93 159.15 B: so i mean we're just setting ourselves up for years and years of abuse [mn] 

159.07 164.04 A: well no other country we've gone into has had so much oil though so i would assume they'll do a better job with this one [noise] 

163.93 169.50 B: oh they'll do a better job of getting the resources but i don't figure they'll do a better job with with the individual leader 

169.54 179.37 B: it's gonna you know that place it the middle east is going to be a problem for us for ever i- it just is and i well that's the way i feel about it and uh 

169.81 171.13 A: oh yeah 

179.50 182.36 B: if if it wasn't for the oil it would be like um 

181.21 186.21 A: yeah who cares 

182.70 183.70 B: uh 

184.46 192.75 B: i guess ethiopia you know who's ever fought over ethiopia [mn] nobody they don't have anything we don't want to take care of anybody from ethiopia [mn] 

187.96 189.96 A: exactly 

190.03 191.77 A: yeah 

192.93 197.74 A: well the fact of the matter is more dinosaurs died in iraq than anywhere else so 

195.93 198.16 B: [laughter] 

198.20 200.79 A: we're gonna end up we're gonna end up fighting over 

201.18 203.16 B: yeah that's true i guess i 

203.83 209.91 B: uh i guess i w- it's interesting to me they did they announce the end of the war or what did they announce the other night i didn't get to see it 

204.06 206.02 A: (( this )) 

209.90 224.01 A: [noise] i don't know that it's necessarily the end of the war but i know they started sending a lot of troops home at least the navy's coming back and i know they're gonna start sending up the clean up people in there now the more the more permanent people the people that'll be there for longer term [noise] i don't know 

213.48 215.20 B: yeah 

215.70 216.76 B: [mn] 

223.46 227.98 B: and then i saw that they're leaving saudi arabia also is that right 

224.74 225.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

227.66 233.67 A: saudi arabia's the one we should have gone into in the first place if you wanna talk people with m- weapons of m- 

230.50 232.33 B: (( but we're probably not )) 

234.69 238.56 A: for a country that gives us problems saudi arabia takes the cake 

238.24 243.27 B: but we're pulling out troops out of saudi arabia now right we're closing our military base there that's what i read 

241.62 245.63 A: i don't know are they moving the troops to iraq 

244.98 250.18 B: no to qatar they're closing the base in saudi arabia and moving 'em to qatar from what i read 

246.79 247.91 A: oh really 

248.95 250.89 A: then that's odd 

250.81 253.21 B: yeah yeah it seems odd doesn't it 

252.98 259.16 A: 'cause there was talk about the links with al qaeda and saddam hussein but the links was al qaeda and saudi or the 

259.29 260.83 A: they're the big ones 

260.35 269.29 B: i know that's you know it's another thing the leaders of of saudi arabia um they're not good leaders uh they're they're good business people but as far as good leaders 

265.84 267.38 A: no they're not 

269.34 274.23 B: and then i i don't understand you know even we support them 

273.78 276.09 A: yeah i don't either 

274.57 277.51 B: (( you know a lot of people a lot of people um )) 

278.21 285.55 B: feel like the whole thing in afghanistan or actually like the people i talked to thought the whole thing in afghanistan's kinda got blown into the mat now 

285.61 286.55 B: (( um )) 

285.94 288.37 A: yeah they really botched that up 

287.65 290.54 B: yeah and and you don't hear anything about it any more 

289.30 300.76 A: and if you notice and if you notice the whole thing with uh saddam hussein didn't start until right around the public realized that we'd missed we'd botched up getting os- osama bin laden 

300.41 301.46 B: yeah 

300.85 307.42 A: it was really which started asking questions about why we hadn't gotten osama bin laden is when they switched the focus to iraq 

306.76 315.23 B: because uh they knew ir- i i feel like they knew iraq wouldn't hide or they couldn't hide saddam couldn't hide and we could find him or we could get rid of him 

313.15 314.32 A: and 

314.99 318.57 A: and and there's there's someone that the americans already hate 

318.20 319.85 B: yeah 

318.91 323.24 A: they didn't have to create a new enemy 'cause people already don't like saddam hussein so 

322.53 323.40 B: [mn] 

323.54 326.62 B: so do you think he's alive or dead 

326.50 330.50 A: uh i don't think he's much trouble whether he's alive or dead so 

330.66 336.90 A: he can't do anything whether he's alive or dead it wouldn't surprise me if he was dead but 

333.07 334.74 B: yeah 

337.14 344.66 A: i mean they could've killed the last time but they didn't so because they didn't want to assassinate a world leader or something silly like that but 

343.96 352.50 B: [mn] well it was i think the last time with the the whole deal with the first gulf war was uh united nations uh approved 

352.51 359.34 B: kicking iraq out of uh kuwait and then after they got out of kuwait we really didn't have any power to g- actually go into iraq 

359.21 360.35 A: yeah 

359.36 362.53 B: uh we're under united nations rules and laws 

362.54 367.44 B: and i think that's the reason we stopped and then from what they'd voted on and what we everyone had agreed on 

367.45 373.27 B: i think we did the right thing by how they voted on it i think we should have went ahead to cure this 

373.35 376.18 B: that many years ago yeah we actually 

373.77 380.05 A: yeah yeah but we made so many enemies in the middle east because we didn't get rid of saddam hussein at the time 

379.33 386.26 B: right i agree we should've if we would have got rid of him at that time a lot of the people in in the middle eastern countries would have supported us 

386.21 387.84 A: yeah 

386.31 389.55 B: but um unfortunately it was part of the united nations 

389.92 398.57 B: uh vote and and action and i think the united nations at the time said well once we get him out of kuwait that uh out of kuwait that's it 

398.51 400.22 A: yeah 

398.78 404.88 B: so i think it was kind of a a bad deal all the way around i want my clinton back that's all i know 

402.20 403.34 A: yeah 

405.07 406.87 A: i would have voted for him again 

406.31 409.02 B: (( [laughter] i would have too if )) 

409.13 414.88 B: things had you know every one of those pesky jobs and money and all that crap [mn] 

414.24 420.10 A: [noise] yeah it's like this war's been a total smokescreen for the fact that bush has just run this economy to to crapper 

419.70 421.46 B: (( yeah and then )) 

420.62 426.12 A: like clinton at least had alan greenspan running things and taking care of the mar- the m- the market and then 

426.48 435.97 A: you had just she let his he let his people to do their jobs and take care of all the domestic issues he may have been crap at foreign policy but he was really good with taking care of our own 

435.56 439.45 B: of us of me that's what i'm concerned about i'm concerned about me 

438.06 439.50 A: exactly 

439.84 440.67 B: (( [mn] )) 

439.88 441.75 A: exactly 

441.55 444.39 B: oh where you at where are you calling from 

443.60 444.94 A: los angeles 

444.39 458.80 B: los angeles i'm in florida very all the way across the how do people 'cause i live in like central florida uh south central florida and uh everyone here supports the war thinks we did the right thing um 

446.39 447.81 A: oh yeah 

448.82 449.94 A: nice 

458.63 462.21 B: uh that type of thing how are people acting there about it 

461.53 467.51 A: uh it depends on who you talk to i live at the beach and most people here at the beach are against the war but i you know 

467.50 476.97 A: other people i run into are for the war and there's other people who i talk to that are just completely amazed that iraq has been able to hide all the evidence of weapons of mass destruction since we went in there 

476.40 478.75 B: [mn] yeah they're well they're good like that [mn] 

477.04 477.96 A: so i mean 

479.05 482.76 A: yeah so i don't know it depends who you talk to like anywhere 

482.13 489.87 B: yeah yeah i think it's here it seems the uh majority of people are are for the war and think we did the right thing showed everybody what we could do 

489.93 495.12 B: and unfortunately i think we've set ourselves up now that that other smaller countries 

490.04 491.82 A: yeah 

494.88 495.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

495.11 506.85 B: know that they can't beat us in a war so they're gonna go to terrorist activities to to fight us and and uh blacken our eyes i guess that worried me i think that worried me about starting the war th- more than anything 

502.77 504.55 A: yeah 

506.45 507.33 A: uh-huh 

508.06 512.29 A: yeah well i don't know [laughter] 

510.66 513.41 B: what time what time is it three thirty there 

513.16 515.78 A: something like that it's like three [noise] 

513.99 515.64 B: yeah 

516.13 517.58 A: almost three thirty 

517.77 522.11 B: is it and uh you we're gonna get one more of these calls right 

521.52 525.51 A: i don't know so well i got one the other day that i couldn't answer because i didn't have my phone 

525.52 526.75 B: i think you get 

525.78 527.89 A: (( so i don't know how many more i'm gonna get )) 

527.25 535.15 B: i think you get three and then they call you uh to see if you see if you get more after that yeah 

532.40 534.32 A: nice pretty cool 

534.53 536.87 A: um when do you get paid 

536.34 544.74 B: yeah i have no idea i didn't even uh look i guess when you get done with the uh first three calls maybe you don't who knows [mn] 

543.74 547.32 A: you'll get a cheque for about fifteen dollars after taxes 

546.73 550.64 B: probably so [laughter] we've gotta pay for this war somehow 

550.61 552.60 A: exactly 

550.84 551.82 B: (( [mn] )) 

552.43 553.73 B: what you do 

552.62 560.64 A: oh well i'm uh a reservist actually yeah 

556.34 561.70 B: a reservist and no worries about going you didn't ever have any worries about going or 

561.58 563.12 A: half my unit's gone 

562.92 563.98 B: really 

564.33 565.96 B: (( huh )) 

564.55 574.32 A: yeah we're more of a career type unit our mission is more conducive well we do it'd be more conducive if we got sent to korea so 

567.06 568.33 B: that's interesting 

575.16 586.59 A: that's that's pretty m- like all of our little play war games and stuff always have the maths the maths and stuff will always have like asian terminology and stuff like that so 

586.63 590.28 B: so you think bush has a chance of winning the next uh election 

587.19 588.57 A: that's more of what we do 

589.68 596.10 A: i sure as hell hope not i didn't vote for he didn't win the last election so 

590.34 592.32 B: (( [laughter] )) 

594.98 595.63 B: (( w- )) 

595.72 598.26 B: well that's i guess that's um 

598.27 599.89 B: my history i'm i'm
