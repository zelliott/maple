27.82 29.13 A: um 

29.36 40.02 A: well i don't know i don't really agree with the war i don't think it should be our biggest concern i think we should deal with our problems rather than spending the money everywhere else but we do need to help out [noise] the people that 

40.16 44.78 A: in iraq the iraqis i guess so it's kind of a catch twenty two 

44.73 52.74 B: yeah well i guess there's a lot of issues there but i guess that what they're asking about is should arm uh disarmament be a big issue for us 

51.42 52.52 A: mhm 

52.56 53.50 A: okay 

53.94 56.10 B: i mean aren't they already disarmed 

55.50 58.54 A: yeah that's what i was wondering they're disarmed

59.21 62.49 B: aren't they already how can they how can you disarm 'em 

62.17 63.44 A: (( what [noise] )) 

63.06 67.44 B: how can you disarm them if they're already beat in there their military's in a shambles 

65.79 67.02 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

67.58 70.24 B: (( and hm )) 

68.62 72.53 A: well maybe this is a question from like a few weeks ago that hasn't been changed 

73.06 74.26 A: or something too 

73.62 78.36 B: well maybe we could just approach it like if the war had never if the war hadn't started 

76.99 78.83 A: yeah uh-huh 

78.79 80.73 B: well what do you think about that 

79.04 79.87 A: okay 

81.37 87.83 A: mm well the think is they never actually found anything there did they so i didn't think in the beginning i thought 

88.33 91.18 A: if they found something yeah and they gotta go look 

91.19 98.27 A: but they never actually found anything and then again of course iraq's going to have all these bombs and stuff if they know we're gonna try and come kill 'em all 

98.76 101.88 A: i mean were they supposed to go oh okay well we're not gonna make any bombs 

102.16 105.19 A: so i kinda don't agree with it 

105.42 110.43 B: [mn] yeah i didn't think that they should go in there and take away their weapons it just seems that's 

110.85 115.23 A: of course every cou- yeah every country wants to have weapons 

111.04 112.45 B: not our business 

114.88 117.65 B: yeah and everyone should have weapons how can you 

115.61 116.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

117.24 121.40 A: mhm we have like in america we have like eight hundred my friend works on nuclear 

121.45 126.57 A: [noise] and he's like on nuclear attack and we have like over eight hundred nukes sitting around and we're not supposed to have 'em 

126.51 127.84 B: why not 

127.33 130.41 A: oh well we're not supposed to have that many 'cause after um 

130.82 133.91 A: whatever u._n. agreement everyone was supposed to disarm i think 

134.28 139.99 A: we're not supposed to have 'em sitting there and then we don't i f- i don't know what it i don't know the whole thing but it's after some agreement we made to just 

140.12 154.54 A: like get rid of a bunch of 'em and we got rid of some but then we hid a bunch that we had and at this point it's kind of like whatever we know everyone does so no one cares but technically we weren't supposed to have all those [noise] so if we're gonna but i mean we should keep 'em in case someone tries to attack us 

144.13 145.38 B: (( mhm [laughter] ))

269.17 271.40 B: always i thought that they were 

271.51 274.75 B: there's uh other countries that are in violation of u._n. 

275.16 283.44 B: initiatives or and they they're not ge- getting come down on i think it's like they just wanted to click a policeman who 

275.96 277.37 A: mhm 

283.46 284.84 A: [noise] 

283.59 287.70 B: they have different things they can charge you with if they wanna like hassle you you know 

287.14 289.08 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

287.89 292.17 B: i thought that was just the situation they wanted to just get down on iraq for some reason mhm 

291.80 293.52 A: (( [noise] you know in [mn] )) 

294.37 297.14 A: [noise] yeah and it it just kind of seems like 

298.36 308.75 A: you know we should worry about our own problems and i understand wanting to get saddam and it just seemed like bush is finishing up what his dad did and it didn't [noise] seem really like we should [noise] risk the lives of our own people for this and just like 

308.62 314.02 A: it's more like yeah we're big and powerful so we're gonna kick all your butts just because we can and to show off 

314.01 315.45 B: yeah that's what i thought too 

315.22 321.05 A: and if i mean if the u._n. and everyone else is against us we should kinda not go against them we should 

321.22 324.43 A: use that support because we're not gonna be a superpower for ever 

324.04 325.69 B: (( yeah i totally agree with that )) 

324.52 326.26 A: no country is [mn] 

325.80 337.26 B: yeah that was the big mistake i thought is it's it's o- other countries go in and just kinda beat up on these other countries but when the whole when the u._n. is against it i don't think we should have gone in there 

336.45 337.76 A: mhm 

337.31 342.00 B: that was a big mistake like didn't they go into panama and uh depose noriega 

342.25 343.53 A: i think so 

342.60 346.14 B: back in the eighties at some point they just went in there 

343.99 345.12 A: (( yeah )) 

346.17 351.59 B: and just attacked him and just took all of his kill all of his soldiers and put him out of power just like that 

350.67 351.77 A: yeah and just 

352.13 357.32 A: it's just we just do these things because we can not because it's the right thing to do or whatever and 

354.72 355.48 B: yeah 

357.33 371.12 A: you know they're better off without saddam and without that whole regime but then again now no one has any water or power and then it's our power companies our water companies our clean up companies going in there so we're making money for our country which is kinda 

371.14 378.97 A: it makes us look bad we're like look what we did we saved all these people and now all our companies are going to get millions of dollars from fixing 'em up so it makes us look 

377.59 378.69 B: (( yeah [noise] mhm yeah )) 

379.35 381.40 A: really really self serving 

381.67 388.83 B: i mean we might have gotten saddam out of there but now that there's so much bad will in over the whole world against the united states 

388.15 390.23 A: mhm 

389.30 391.99 B: i think we're just gonna pay the price for that eventually 

391.90 393.00 A: yeah 

394.43 396.33 A: we're better off being friendly 

396.54 402.29 A: and then things like where france is against us so like we're not calling fries french fries any more that's just stupid 

401.49 404.42 B: mm that's just so dumb it's just 

403.21 404.37 A: [laughter] 

404.52 417.71 B: you know what i mean to me it's like a kind of a mob mentality after a certain point whoever's kind of shouting loudest and the simplest idea people just go along with it and if you disagree then you're like a problem and a troublemaker and 

407.88 409.26 A: mhm 

413.55 414.48 A: yeah 

417.50 418.55 A: that's true 

417.59 421.97 B: they should be able to disagree with what we wanna do and not have 

421.01 426.55 A: well that's what our whole country's based on is like a freedom of speech and having your opinions and 

423.07 424.50 B: (( yeah )) 

425.61 426.33 B: yeah 

426.63 435.06 A: then we're like and the whole thing if you're not with us and you're against us well so what if you're against us it's your right and it's like an american to have your own opinions 

431.87 432.82 B: that's right 

434.89 436.03 B: yeah 

436.49 437.42 A: (( mm )) 

437.07 439.95 B: it's really sad do you like bush at all 

439.75 440.79 A: no 

440.90 442.15 B: did you vote for 

441.85 444.05 A: um yeah but i was 

443.79 445.22 B: (( him [mn] ooh )) 

444.07 448.80 A: like nineteen well it was that or and at the time i don't know why i really did but 

448.95 450.00 B: (( yeah i didn't )) 

449.33 451.07 A: i don't know i'm looking at 

451.44 453.59 A: i mean i'm not republican 

454.05 457.15 A: and i'm not but i'm not real liberal either and 

457.81 461.72 A: it was just like he seemed lesser of the two evils at the time the other guy 

461.34 463.99 B: mhm [laughter] gore yeah hm 

461.83 467.15 A: which had blake anders- yeah gore he just seemed so stupid to me he just seemed like a bill clinton where he could 

467.19 468.75 A: he just didn't know what he was doing 

468.78 471.52 A: but then bush bush has never left the country 

471.66 474.98 A: in like his life he's never gone anywhere outside the u._s. which that's a 

474.54 475.57 B: (( for real agree )) 

475.00 479.98 A: yeah and i lived in europe for a year and that really changes things a lot and gives you a whole new perspective 

480.41 483.80 A: on the world and it's just like never having done that now it kinda makes me think 

484.25 486.28 A: (( you know g- the guy's kinda )) 

486.79 488.03 A: closed in 

488.07 489.25 A: (( i i don't know )) 

489.47 493.60 B: yeah i think he's a he's just a stupid man that's all there is to it [sigh] 

492.30 493.35 A: mhm 

494.78 496.54 A: he won't get reelected though 

496.40 499.94 B: i hope not but look how popular he is for this whole thing 

498.86 502.30 A: that's true well war presidents always get popular whenever there's a war 

501.80 504.59 B: hey well that's how people get elected though too 

503.54 504.58 A: that's true 

505.60 507.03 B: it's just a 

507.04 512.34 B: the majority of people out there that are not too not looking into it and they're not interested in 

512.44 515.26 B: democracy and those kind of things 

514.62 515.96 A: mhm 

515.47 517.57 B: they will vote for him 

518.02 522.90 B: [sigh] just hope he's who who can the democrats put up against him though do you know what i mean hm 

522.10 524.35 A: that's true yeah there really 

525.18 534.41 A: who'd they have like they were talking i was watching something where they were talking about like possible candidates i can't remember but no one was it was all people you've never really heard of never did much 

535.22 540.76 A: at least you know bush has done something maybe good or bad but people know him you know 

538.68 539.56 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

541.47 548.98 A: now like you know if you look at a ballot and you don't know who the other guy is really never heard much about him and you you know and you think bush is okay 

549.79 552.25 B: so do you think he was okay though yeah 

551.70 554.78 A: but not really no i don't like well the war thing 

555.48 560.71 A: and and if you look at the promises he made and everything he said and what he actually did like they contradict each other 

561.17 564.41 A: well i was watching it was something on comedy central or one of those shows and they had 

563.58 565.00 B: (( [laughter] comedy central [mn] )) 

564.52 566.82 A: well they had bush they had him 

567.27 577.30 A: when he was running and everything he was saying and it was like bush against bush and it was pre-elected bush and elected bush and the things he's saying were total opposite he could like fight against himself with the comments he was making 

577.22 586.30 A: and it was real weird to watch it because it was totally him going like i would not do this and then him we're gonna do this once he got elected he just completely changed everything he said and 

585.47 587.66 B: hm hm [laughter] don't they always do that though 

587.10 588.75 A: mm yeah 

589.03 589.97 A: (( i don't know )) 

589.69 598.92 B: i think that's once they get into office and they have all these advisers that have been in washington a long time and they tell 'em all these things and they realize how far off they were 

599.13 599.89 B: (( before they get to ))
