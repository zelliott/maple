84.98 85.43 A: uh 

85.78 89.21 B: to me that's uh yeah he said what an idiot 

88.04 98.81 A: right right see i don't like i don't like smoking either and i find smoke bothers my eyes and makes me cough and choke sometimes so so i guess 

93.10 93.52 B: so 

97.18 97.80 B: yeah 

99.21 102.27 A: it depends on what we're talking about if 

102.89 105.71 B: for other people you know i i find uh like 

105.92 106.75 B: people that 

107.27 108.95 B: i- in a re- it's rude that 

109.24 111.35 B: i know a lot of restaurants are stopping it now but 

111.77 112.29 A: mhm 

111.84 115.51 B: like if you're sitting in a restaurant and somebody at the table next to you lights up a cigarette 

115.91 116.38 B: it's like 

116.68 118.07 B: uh 

117.89 119.46 A: well we live in dallas 

119.84 120.61 A: and 

120.71 127.28 A: they just now i think today passed a law that they're not going to be able to allow them smoke in restaurants or 

127.47 129.64 A: i'm not sure what other le- public places 

129.98 132.11 B: we're in flor- i'm in florida and 

132.25 133.86 B: ocala florida and 

133.97 136.46 B: uh a lot of the restaurants don't allow it 

136.68 137.25 A: mhm 

136.80 144.74 B: uh they're smoke free you they have places outside where you can sit they'll even serve you out there if you want to smoke but it's outside 

142.80 146.28 A: you're right but that's okay really don't pollute my air 

145.72 148.38 B: but don't but don't bring it inside 

147.62 157.25 A: that's the thing i i guess i worry too much about is the second hand smoke although when my kids were growing up and i have three boys when they were growing up i was a smoker 

157.75 160.15 A: and i smoked in the house and i smoked around them 

160.04 160.34 B: yep 

160.44 164.52 B: well i was the same way i raised i had these three girls and and they 

163.14 163.64 A: mhm 

164.97 173.17 B: lived with me smoking but when my husband quit we wouldn't even let people basically in the house they just smoked outside (( )) house 

171.44 174.68 A: that's what we did right cause we didn't want the smoke in the house 

174.25 177.64 B: right and if i'm not doing it i just don't want anybody else to do it either 

177.26 177.65 A: yeah 

177.75 178.18 A: yeah 

178.83 183.00 A: and the drinking thing i don't have a problem with drinking until they get on the road

186.26 187.71 B: we were just talking about it the other day 

187.88 194.94 B: they that they shouldn't serv- or they shouldn't have se- sell single cold beers 

195.45 198.91 B: because why is someone going to buy a single beer if it's not to drink and drive 

198.80 200.58 A: drink and get behind the wheel 

200.26 206.72 B: that's right they're not going take that one beer and go home and drink it they're going to get behind the wheel they're going to pop the top and they're going to drink 

200.73 202.83 A: yeah or drink immediately
