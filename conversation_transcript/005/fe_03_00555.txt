185.57 187.29 A: eh i are there no rules or 

187.00 187.59 B: well the- 

188.59 189.85 B: i i don't really know

199.57 200.73 A: reality shows 

201.63 202.40 A: let's give them uh 

201.81 204.97 B: oh so my favorite anyway back to the my favorite 

205.08 206.20 B: is right now 

206.66 207.79 B: is joe millionaire 

208.12 209.71 B: but it's just because there's nothing else 

209.43 215.22 A: well it's it's a clever premise you know and some network executive is 

210.37 210.86 B: on 

215.93 220.19 A: you know is getting his calls returned all over town because he thought of it 

219.97 220.38 B: i'm 

220.53 223.08 B: i like i seriously just want to see the last one 

223.43 224.16 B: and see 

224.52 227.54 A: when they when when the when the when the when the triumphant 

224.55 225.25 B: what happened 

227.64 228.47 A: winner with 

228.96 232.85 A: dreams of huge money in her eyes finds out the guy works construction 

232.58 233.14 B: yeah 

237.31 241.64 B: but the thing that's weird like i've been ready the papers and stuff like he really isn't that bad off 

242.24 246.99 B: like because construction workers in california if they're driving a bulldozer they make more than nineteen thousand a year 

247.91 249.11 B: you know like because i used 

248.63 250.19 A: so they're lying about what he makes 

250.23 251.14 B: i think they are 

251.95 256.53 A: to make it to make it yeah you know what anybody in construction makes more money 

252.12 252.46 B: and 

256.34 262.71 B: yeah and especially the heavy load like heavy machine loader guys i mean because i used to i used to work for labor ready 

259.87 260.45 A: yeah 

263.48 265.67 B: i used to manage the company there in santa cruz 

265.10 265.59 A: uh-huh 

266.37 269.87 B: and we used to pay like twenty dollars an hour for somebody that could run a bulldozer 

270.54 271.09 A: yeah 

271.05 272.17 B: you know so i mean like 

272.08 272.60 A: yeah 

272.90 273.56 B: it depends 

272.90 274.10 A: and it if the if 

274.26 277.43 A: uh i don't know if the guys are union they get awesome amounts 

277.34 277.88 B: yeah 

278.39 280.74 B: and then like i was reading somewhere else where he um 

281.82 285.40 B: he traveled he used to travel to europe every summer with his family 

286.57 290.34 B: and his his parents actually have an estate in los angeles 

290.65 294.09 A: remember reading something briefly that apparently he's dumb as a board though 

294.39 296.39 B: yeah well he comes across as dumb as a board 

297.90 300.29 B: but it's just funny to like to see how they 

299.98 301.06 A: are you attracted to him 

301.60 302.06 B: no 

302.42 302.93 A: why not 

304.13 305.11 B: i think his his 

306.07 308.63 B: he's looks like a brute to me you know like 

308.32 309.55 A: a brute 

309.15 309.51 B: yeah 

310.18 310.83 B: like 

310.33 310.84 A: he's just 

311.06 312.38 A: not you're type huh (( )) 

311.97 312.44 B: no 

312.89 313.83 A: because he's sort of like 

314.22 314.74 A: he's got 

314.84 318.04 A: you know to me i guess he's got the good looks and you know that 

318.27 322.01 A: especially if he had money you'd figure women would be falling all over themselves 

323.41 324.00 B: yeah 

323.66 325.38 A: who knows who knows 

326.23 326.56 B: but 

326.80 327.26 B: i don't know 

327.54 328.51 B: i like i don't like like 

329.24 333.39 B: like the fear factor and stuff like that like i'll wa- i'll i'll watch them 

331.33 331.72 A: yeah 

334.15 336.41 B: just because i like like i'll watch that stuff 

335.80 339.06 A: that's way too weird people have to do disgusting things (( right )) eat 

339.92 347.19 B: yeah but the m- the whole plan like nobody would do that be like hey you know what will you eat this for me i mean nobody would actually do that but there's money involved 

339.97 340.72 A: worms or 

340.98 341.35 A: (( brad )) 

347.31 347.87 B: for like 

347.83 350.23 A: right so like what's what's 

348.38 349.93 B: it's just kind of interesting to see like 

350.50 351.52 A: you know i mean that's just 

351.72 351.99 A: like 

352.76 353.74 A: i i'd rather 

353.99 356.38 A: try to get away from people like that than 

356.58 359.30 A: invite them into my living room you know even it is on the t._v. 

359.90 360.61 A: but oh well 

362.24 363.39 A: so 

363.69 367.33 A: twenty three years old god the future is so bright you need shades right 

367.47 368.00 B: yeah

394.84 395.95 A: yeah i know them 

395.18 397.97 B: kind of like one of those weird businesses like everybody needs one but 

396.68 402.12 A: that's they're they're the people that you go to a uh a store that's going out of business you think you'll get really good deals 

402.40 405.87 A: and you don't get that good deals because they bring in new merchandise and 

406.21 406.77 B: right 

406.68 408.84 A: and uh the prices are you know 

409.25 411.83 A: not as good as they would be if a genuine distressed 

412.22 414.23 A: business was going out of business and stuff

418.67 420.22 A: or do the people that actually 

420.66 423.78 B: i'll i'll travel occasionally but the most part is it's the people who work 

422.52 422.98 A: uh-huh

500.04 500.58 B: um 

502.39 504.35 B: i don't know he just came across it like it was

507.75 508.33 A: uh-huh 

508.76 509.33 B: and that's it 

508.89 510.70 A: did he do his research before he bought it 

510.84 511.36 B: yeah 

511.58 514.22 A: because um was he always an entrepreneur or did he have a 

514.59 517.39 A: you know did he work for someone else and have a career before that
