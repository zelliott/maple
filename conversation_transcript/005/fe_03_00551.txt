26.67 28.36 A: i'm a survivor fan 

27.69 29.96 B: survivor i i used to watch the first one 

30.89 33.17 B: uh then i kind of lost interest on it 

34.75 40.97 A: and then well now it's the i can't get into that bachelorette or anything like that that one those are too 

41.98 42.97 A: corny for me 

44.06 47.61 A: but and then well star search it's not really reality but 

48.33 49.34 A: in a way it is 

49.53 52.88 B: yeah what what is that uh that idol show that just started now 

53.42 55.02 B: i think it was on this week 

55.24 55.97 A: yeah they're 

55.62 55.88 B: that 

56.01 56.96 B: talent search 

57.53 61.14 A: yeah it's almost like a star search where they're it's just singing 

61.55 62.27 A: and um 

63.13 63.45 A: the 

64.10 66.52 A: three judges pick whether they can go on 

67.42 68.33 A: to the final 

69.19 69.96 A: thing you know t- 

69.40 71.28 B: yeah that seems to be really popular 

71.56 72.32 B: um though 

71.88 72.51 A: i watched 

73.20 74.39 A: some of it last night 

74.61 75.73 A: uh the auditions 

76.45 78.19 A: and the people are so bad 

77.78 79.89 B: that's what makes it fun though 

79.60 80.89 A: a- uh but 

80.54 81.85 B: i think part of the um 

82.61 85.15 B: the reason why people watch these shows is to 

86.47 89.81 B: put themselves in their shoes and you can laugh at their embarrassment 

89.97 90.57 A: mhm 

90.95 92.98 B: -se i know i wouldn't want to be doing any of those 

91.26 91.52 A: wha- 

93.63 95.22 B: uh things on television 

95.34 95.83 A: no 

95.48 96.82 B: with the whole world watching 

98.21 101.74 A: but i do survivor and fear factor are my favorite though 

101.02 103.01 B: oh yeah i forgot about that one 

103.43 107.87 A: i just i my husband won't watch survivor with me but he'll watch fear factor 

108.18 116.05 B: i watch that all the time i think it's on monday nights and they're always eating some kind of horrible thing from an animal and uh 

110.81 111.17 A: yes 

114.44 115.07 A: i know 

116.38 120.83 B: can't imagine doing any of that not for fifty thousand dollars or 

116.70 117.57 A: it's just 

118.49 119.12 A: well in 

121.38 125.37 A: i know because i ca- i almost get sick just watching it but i don't know i'm 

121.58 122.42 B: hundred thousand dollar 

126.25 129.35 A: just have to watch it to see what they're going to do 

128.61 131.28 B: yeah that each week they top the previous 

131.69 135.53 B: uh last week was making me a little nervous when they were under water for so long 

135.77 136.53 A: oh i know 

136.65 138.19 B: i thought some of them was going to drown 

136.73 137.30 A: i couldn't 

139.32 142.03 A: i know because -at that one that didn't even look like 

142.47 143.99 A: um they were going to come and help 

145.25 146.76 B: yeah i wonder what kind of um 

145.37 145.66 A: and if 

147.77 156.03 B: insurance they have on that show maybe that's why the the prize money is so low because their liability insurance is so high 

149.88 150.75 A: i know 

158.70 159.98 A: i don't know but it's 

160.51 161.67 A: just it's int- i had 

161.85 164.47 A: i can get into some of them not all of them 

164.16 166.68 B: the ones when they're walking the (( lil )) tight w- rope 

167.37 167.95 B: the height 

168.35 168.80 B: the height 

168.99 170.49 B: is uh what scares me 

171.53 173.50 B: they had to cross a bridge on stilts 

171.76 172.13 A: uh 

174.17 174.73 A: yeah i 

174.53 175.77 B: suspended bridge 

175.72 177.56 A: i'd be scared but i think 

178.30 180.16 A: since i know the harness in on you know 

180.58 181.53 A: it would be okay 

182.58 183.14 A: but it's 

183.31 186.34 A: the wa- the water ones and when you're enclosed in something i 

186.67 189.47 A: because i'm claustrophobic anyway so forget it 

188.35 189.02 B: mhm 

189.16 191.17 B: so why do you watch those shows 

192.25 192.73 A: well 

193.14 193.64 A: i 

193.85 194.82 B: is it just to be like 

195.21 198.57 B: shocked or is it more because it's entertaining for you 

199.13 200.28 A: well both really 

199.84 201.02 B: i think because it i think it 

201.51 203.44 B: it help- i think it's more of the shock 

204.25 204.85 B: value 

205.67 206.86 A: becau- well see i'm 

207.21 208.08 A: i don't work 

208.31 210.38 A: i'm a housewife and i'm disabled 

210.88 215.42 A: so there's not much to do anyways except play on the computer and watch t._v. 

214.59 215.40 B: oh okay 

216.14 217.54 A: so it's like 

217.38 218.06 B: hm hm 

219.27 223.87 A: and once i get hooked on one of them shows then forget it but like the millionaire show you were talking about 

223.91 224.37 B: mhm 

224.59 226.22 A: i got into that at first 

226.73 227.95 A: and then i got sick of it 

229.45 229.87 A: i just 

230.38 233.53 A: i don't know what it was i just couldn't stand watching it anymore 

235.42 242.79 B: was that the the gentlemen that selected them from among the twenty five girls and now they had the bachelorette was the se- sequel 

235.62 236.02 A: but 

243.22 243.84 A: no the 

244.22 245.70 A: the who wants to be a millionaire 

246.34 247.48 A: is that the one you were talking a- 

246.80 249.66 B: oh i i don't think that's a reality t._v. show 

249.74 250.48 B: i think it's that 

250.59 251.27 B: um 

250.93 252.87 A: oh more yeah that'd be more like game show 

251.87 253.93 B: when you when you want to marry the millionaire 

254.48 255.18 A: yeah that was 

254.83 255.71 B: the bachelor 

256.37 257.09 A: i watch 

257.65 260.14 A: some of that joe millionaire but that's really 

260.29 261.32 B: that's deceptive 

261.45 263.35 B: i would be angry if i were on that show 

264.17 265.31 A: i know because it's like 

265.52 267.82 A: you know most of them girls want him just for the money 

268.53 271.82 B: of course and the what is that guy he's just a construction worker 

272.08 272.65 A: yeah 

272.77 273.79 A: and 

274.11 275.08 B: i think he makes 

274.25 275.69 A: because they're in for a shock 

275.42 278.52 B: yeah i read he makes about nineteen thousand dollars a year 

278.36 278.83 A: mhm 

278.63 279.23 B: and 

280.09 281.16 B: it's just to me it 

281.40 283.13 B: that's pushing the edge because it's 

283.66 285.57 B: it's a total deception 

285.75 289.31 B: the people were duped into going on the show i don't know if they were compensated 

289.85 290.50 B: but um 

290.83 291.78 B: at least the others 

291.00 292.54 A: well they get the necklaces 

292.07 296.92 B: at least the other shows you c- you have a chance at winning something tangible but not on that one 

298.07 300.70 B: tha- i think that was the worst of them all 

298.24 298.97 A: because uh 

300.39 304.41 A: well now i see a commercial there's going to be a new one about where the 

304.67 305.47 A: the people 

305.69 308.14 A: vote on the internet to marry somebody 

308.25 308.70 B: huh 

309.71 310.54 A: they just put 

310.85 311.95 A: they'll show people 

312.45 313.93 A: and you go on the internet 

314.10 318.22 A: and say well this one's should to marry this one and then they're supposed to m- get married on t._v. 

319.50 320.58 A: and it's like p- 

321.12 321.59 B: they won't 

321.82 324.93 B: couldn't find me doing that 

323.12 325.03 A: i know 

325.23 327.29 B: it's bad enough chatting with people on the internet 

327.65 329.18 B: but then to not even see them 

330.26 330.91 A: yeah and then 

330.37 330.78 B: would that 

331.32 331.91 B: even worse 

332.39 333.88 A: to marry them i mean i can't 

334.34 334.92 B: sure 

335.02 336.83 A: you don't go into a marriage like that it's just 

337.03 337.89 A: you know 

337.40 338.09 B: no way 

338.89 343.04 B: but after i i work in the in the computer field as programmer analyst 

343.65 346.91 B: and i guess when i come home i'm so tired mentally that i want to 

347.25 348.78 B: just veg- out and watch this 

349.34 351.24 A: and laugh 

349.94 352.02 B: and laugh yeah and ma- they make they make me laugh 

352.20 352.97 A: i know 

352.36 354.05 B: have you seen the show um 

354.75 355.70 B: star dates 

356.20 356.76 A: no 

357.27 358.28 A: i never heard of that one 

357.64 361.12 B: they pick a celebri- it's on uh what channel is that on 

362.62 363.74 B: can't remember the channel 

363.94 364.85 B: i think it's e. 

364.95 369.65 B: but i may be mistaken and uh it's a celebrity goes on a date like they had eddie munster 

370.17 370.92 A: oh my god 

370.55 371.90 B: uh butch patrick 

372.00 373.42 B: and he goes on a date with a 

373.72 374.42 B: with a um 

374.60 375.39 B: young woman 

376.20 379.77 B: and they're all airheads they uh 

379.90 382.23 B: the camera's are there and they had the girl from the love boat 

383.01 385.49 B: that little girl uh that was the captain's daughter 

385.45 386.05 A: uh-huh

393.90 394.70 B: kim fields 

394.92 396.26 B: she was 

395.10 397.43 A: it would be fun though just to see what they look like now 

397.77 400.78 B: yeah i think that's part of the lure too is ye- you're always 

400.88 403.91 B: curious about where are they now and uh 

405.59 406.29 B: oh i just 

406.39 408.35 B: there's a fascination with hollywood there 

409.54 412.15 B: that show's harmless though some of these other one's like 

409.73 410.42 A: but 

412.74 415.22 B: fear factor they have to eat like pigs liver 

415.50 416.06 B: pureed 

415.65 416.04 A: yeah 

416.20 417.12 B: pigs liver and 

417.95 419.99 B: i couldn't do that 

418.10 418.49 A: the 

419.68 425.04 A: the what was that the horse rectum and everything else it was like (( ooaulgh )) 

422.47 423.86 B: yeah 

425.76 429.21 B: yeah how uh how do you you prepare yourself for that 

429.85 432.42 A: and what i can't understand though y- when they 

432.84 433.13 A: start 

433.48 433.95 A: you know 

434.23 435.14 A: when i seen it 

435.62 437.77 A: at first i would say forget it i give up 

438.03 440.07 A: why try to attempt to eat it 

440.47 441.38 A: and then quit 

441.68 443.96 A: when you've already had it in your mouth 

443.56 446.42 B: oh there was one girl left where she drank about two or three 

446.56 448.02 B: glasses of something 

448.39 449.19 A: that liver 

448.59 450.76 B: and then she gave up i mean 

449.97 450.59 A: i know 

451.01 453.75 B: if you've already downed that much you might as well keep going for it 

455.03 456.26 A: -eah cause even i mean 

456.43 459.67 A: try to finish and even if you do throw it up you're out anyways but at least 

460.44 462.72 A: try to you know to stay in the game 

462.60 463.32 B: sure 

463.73 465.81 A: don't torture yourself any more than you have to 

465.69 466.85 B: i always wonder um 

467.68 469.90 B: the sponsors of these shows what they 

470.80 471.97 B: what they think 

472.71 474.25 B: what are they thinking when they're 

475.16 477.52 B: advertising these products whe- do what do they 

475.30 476.12 A: i know well 

477.63 479.71 B: what kind of audience they're trying to attract 

480.89 485.42 A: i want to know who comes up with these ideas to eat this stuff 

484.97 485.47 B: oh who 

485.71 486.49 B: you mean uh uh 

486.84 490.21 B: bathing in a tub with snakes isn't your cup of tea 

489.15 490.04 A: ah 

491.06 494.46 A: you know cause i mean i know they're very safe on that show 

494.98 495.48 A: and it 

495.69 497.72 A: anything they eat it has to be 

498.67 501.68 A: it can't be harmful to you or they wouldn't you know make them do it 

502.36 503.90 B: well harmful and unpleasant 

505.32 508.33 B: i don't know if there's such a fine line between those two 

509.62 510.57 B: could eat those uh 

510.84 512.72 B: what were those goose embryos 

512.82 513.85 A: ah i know 

513.95 515.98 B: yeah that was making me squirm 

514.06 514.63 A: that was 

517.45 518.71 A: especially with the feathers on 

522.76 525.79 B: take a look at uh when if you get cable do you have cable 

525.72 526.16 A: yes 

526.37 530.73 B: so take a look and see if you could find where star dates is uh i think it's on the e. 

530.87 531.38 B: channel 

532.75 534.46 B: i think it c- it might be on e. 

532.93 533.40 A: yeah 

534.87 537.32 B: because the other show on there is the anna nicole show 

538.24 540.71 A: what is that on at night late at night or 

540.39 544.72 B: um it's not on anymore i think season one ended it was on sunday nights 

545.03 545.68 A: ah okay 

545.36 546.12 B: and it just 

546.45 549.19 B: invites you into her uh her whole world 

550.29 551.36 A: no but i mean that other 

550.38 553.14 B: and that's well that was quite humorous though cause she had uh 

554.21 557.01 B: quite a cast of characters that was doing outrageous things 

557.16 557.69 B: she had a 

558.44 560.24 B: uh more like a hillbilly 

560.45 563.00 B: relative long lost relative come visit her 

563.49 564.58 B: and she had no teeth 

565.17 565.71 A: ah jeeze 

565.18 567.34 B: and she got drunk at the christmas party and 

568.41 569.76 B: that's why i just can't believe that 

569.96 571.71 B: it's after watching these shows it makes you 

572.03 573.36 B: feel that you're not uh 

573.73 575.81 B: your family is not as dysfunctional as theirs is 

576.24 576.85 B: so 

577.20 578.17 B: well then you laugh at it 

581.29 583.85 B: i think that's the the part we like my sister and i watch it 

581.40 581.85 A: but it 

584.61 586.87 B: i used to visit her on the weekend we'd watch it together 

588.38 589.20 B: it was a lot of fun 

592.20 594.31 A: so how long are we supposed to talk about this 

594.54 596.57 B: i don't know i think about ten minutes i think 

594.79 595.37 A: do you know 

596.93 597.35 A: is it 

597.47 598.98 B: it's almost ten minutes now
