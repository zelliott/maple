7.08 16.85 A: [lipsmack] yeah hi there i uh agreed to talk on this uh topic today i but i've only actually watched one episode of survivor and i'm n- not a avid uh viewer of t._v. per se 

16.52 17.85 B: oh interesting 

17.58 19.16 A: how about yourself 

18.55 28.92 B: i actually love the reality shows [laughter] and i like them a lot better than regular shows you know like frasier or or other kind of sitcoms and dramas um 

20.30 21.53 A: [laughter] 

29.08 40.07 B: i'm actually a sociologist and so i think that's kind of why i like to watch them because it's just every one is a study in human behavior and so that's what i study as my job 

39.56 46.76 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] that's wonderful i'm a psychologist i'm a research uh a a social psychologist we do research and get people to change their behavior [sigh] 

42.40 43.62 B: oh yeah 

46.08 47.12 B: right 

46.66 60.85 A: uh so i am interested in teaching and things like that and i find that i find what i watched the bit of the snippets that i've watched i find it quite frustrating [sigh] uh i as are soap operas they're absolutely inane [sigh] um but um the the reality t._v. um um 

53.97 54.81 B: (( mm )) 

57.11 58.11 B: yeah 

60.69 69.21 A: i guess i haven't watched enough of it i'm i'm finding this new one this idea about joe millionaire [sigh] uh that's that's [laughter] been quite tantalizing have you watched any of that 

65.28 66.17 B: (( ahah )) 

68.23 83.06 B: [sigh] i have actually i've been watching that uh i thought it was a pretty interesting thing for them to base it all on a lie and so i just wanted to tune in and sort of see how they were going to make it work [sigh] uh and i actually have kept watching it's been pretty interesting 

82.91 84.07 B: um 

84.96 97.37 B: [lipsmack] y- yeah it's y- it's a really strange idea and kind of demented but you know uh you don't i you don't feel so bad for the women because you know that they're there just to get all this money and so you know 

95.07 98.14 A: [laughter] [laughter] gold diggers yeah [sigh] 

97.41 100.83 B: right so uh it's interesting to see [mn] 

101.21 112.37 B: that you know it's formulated as [sigh] love versus money and is he going to find someone who cares about him enough to not care about the money and the deception and [sigh] it's it's a it's an interesting one i don't know 

112.19 122.87 A: i guess seeing people uh live uh you know make online decisions uh um [sigh] my sister's addicted to was addicted to real life the m._t._v. show [sigh] 

122.30 123.94 B: oh i never saw that one 

123.41 126.37 A: no i've seen bits of that and it that is really 

126.51 128.69 A: can i say dumb 

128.05 129.91 B: [laughter] 

128.59 141.69 A: uh the dialogue that y- i'm okay so i'm fifty one years old so i'm watching twenty one year olds negotiate relationships so m- that's probably part of it [sigh] even though i i love m._t._v. uh vh1 i love all that stuff the music but um 

132.24 133.11 B: (( ahah )) 

133.83 135.06 B: right 

136.89 138.01 B: right 

141.61 153.21 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] that i guess it's um a a d- a different stage of my life [sigh] and i guess i shouldn't be so frustrated with these kids as they uh flounder through [laughter] you know these new discoveries [laughter] um 

147.70 148.64 B: [laughter] 

151.57 165.00 B: right well you know it's not only age though because i'm only twenty five and i think that some of the ways that they interact with each other are are just insane on any of these shows where there are young people you know i mean it 

160.65 162.00 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

165.15 168.69 B: it it's pretty ridiculous i fully agree 

167.21 167.89 A: (( [noise] )) 

168.09 180.05 A: they're pretty cheesy i mean some of the stuff they say and and you know they're playing for t._v. [sigh] and so you say they can't be so vacuous in real life please tell me but but of course we've all met people that are full well that vacuous in in real life 

172.64 173.75 B: (( right [mn] )) 

176.02 177.76 B: [laughter] 

178.77 181.14 B: right right absolutely 

180.61 189.40 A: so um yeah i was i watched almost thirty years ago w- before you were born jennifer the loud family the original reality t._v. 

185.46 187.48 B: [laughter] 

188.94 189.79 B: (( mm )) 

189.27 202.59 A: which was fascinating every week they'd come on for i guess for an hour on public television [sigh] and there was this whole family that took about all of you know twenty minutes to get used to the cameras [sigh] if that long and then their lives started to unfold and and unravel 

198.25 199.27 B: yeah 

202.45 217.43 A: [sigh] and that was that was fascinating but now you know i was just re- that was real and in fact one of the the w- son came out he was gay the w- the husband and wife i think they got divorced the the you know the kid the young girl is standing around saying jeeze louise [sigh] you know all this and on t._v. too 

204.64 205.74 B: yeah 

207.36 208.37 B: right 

215.83 218.07 B: [laughter] yeah wow 

217.51 225.45 A: so but now i was just reading something in the newspaper about some contestants a reality t._v. it was um it was class reunion 

225.19 226.25 B: mhm 

225.43 236.82 A: and uh actually uh as i suspected [sigh] uh they they found a bunch of people not all of them even graduated in that year [sigh] but they coached one of them okay we want you to play the part of the nerd who always after the 

231.96 233.06 B: (( yeah )) 

236.66 249.13 A: the class beauty [sigh] and you know blah blah blah [sigh] and you know this person who happens to be a a a college professor [sigh] uh said no i don't think i'm going to do that you know [laughter] so a lot of it is hokey you know 

237.57 238.86 B: right 

245.07 247.27 B: [laughter] yeah 

248.26 249.79 B: right right 

249.14 257.30 A: [lipsmack] so um but but you're enjoying you're going to be now how how much longer i know joe millionaire started [sigh] uh is it still running 

257.07 263.81 B: uh it is yeah there's another episode on monday i believe so if you wanted to check it out it's on at nine uh 

262.85 264.43 A: nine o'clock huh oh 

263.61 276.07 B: well uh eastern i don't know where you are but uh [sigh] uh yeah it's i don't know they d- they d- haven't even said how long it's going to last because they kind of had to play it by ear since they didn't know if the secret was going to come out 

276.30 286.92 B: uh along the way you know it's unlike something like survivor where they have a routine and they know when someone's going to get voted out each time and so they [mn] know exactly how many episodes they're going to have so 

286.09 290.94 A: [sigh] wait a minute now this y- this was filmed a while back right just like i 

289.97 294.04 B: well yeah i suppose that's true so i guess 

293.55 303.18 A: mean like everybody in the country knows i mean i'm i'm thinking that we're watching things that were filmed a while ago and we all are hip to it but these women were deceived like two or three or six months ago [sigh] 

298.18 299.34 B: right 

302.58 303.59 B: right 

303.06 315.73 A: and they're going to get to be full well you know [sigh] uh right on nationwide t._v. you know oh whoa i'm i'm married to like a pauper a guy that makes about nineteen thousand dollars a year [laughter] or i'm i'm going to be married to [sigh] yeah so um 

307.47 308.31 B: right 

311.20 313.47 B: [laughter] right 

315.56 324.25 A: [lipsmack] uh i think uh i think i think it's interesting i'm glad i'm glad people have the guts to get up there and do it uh that's that's one thing [sigh] but it d- 

321.86 323.30 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

323.36 330.64 B: well maybe guts or maybe st- stupidity or something i mean i can't imagine wanting to be on some of them 

330.72 336.88 B: [sigh] i could imagine wanting to go on something like american idol where it's giving you a legitimate opportunity 

336.50 337.57 A: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

336.77 346.72 B: in theory but uh you know some of these other ones like who wants to marry a millionaire and all those kind of things i just i [mn] it's humiliating i don't see why you would go on something like that 

346.09 357.21 A: [noise] i think so but you know you figure you've been dating a bunch of jerks and oh well maybe you'll be on t._v. get to be famous and actually meet somebody sexy is this joe millionaire is he kinda cute does he have charisma or something 

349.36 350.54 B: [laughter] 

356.91 370.20 B: yeah he's cute he seems like a really genuinely nice guy actually he's not the kind of person that you normally see on these shows who is normally really aggressive or you know n- n- needs the limelight or he just seems like a really nice person actually 

362.59 363.79 A: mhm 

364.37 365.49 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

369.29 374.81 A: ahah well that at least that you know somebody will end up maybe with a nice guy if they can handle it 

374.45 379.23 B: yeah well the question is are any of the women nice because they don't really seem like it [mn] 

377.77 382.49 A: [sigh] they don't they don't really seem uh they're kinda like barbie dolls i would imagine huh 

379.30 380.53 B: no 

382.22 393.64 B: yeah and just you know talking all about if they need a man with charm and elegance and he didn't like his foie gras and so one of the girls was all disgusted he didn't have any taste and you know these kinds of people 

393.43 405.11 A: oh that's uh they sound a bunch of oh they sound a bunch of gold diggers see that's one thing [sigh] they didn't put put any uh you know real uh [sigh] homespun rebeccas and emilys in there or anything i guess huh [sigh] 

397.23 398.99 B: right right 

403.25 412.28 B: [laughter] [sigh] or it maybe that you know he let me them go earlier because they weren't as aggressive in really wanting to bag the man 

411.88 414.11 A: oh he s- chooses them 

413.92 422.54 B: he he doesn't choose the original pool but he sort of gets to know them a little bit each week and then he has to choose some to stay on and some to go 

421.93 432.14 A: oh i see so he does have a say in this as to how things are going to turn out [sigh] so he could be missing the the good ones and choosing the uh platinum you know c- plated ones huh 

423.16 424.22 B: yeah 

425.71 426.80 B: yes 

431.76 435.82 B: right and i think he has done that with a few of his choices 

434.72 436.33 A: (( [laughter] )) 

436.51 445.29 A: oh well [sigh] oh well well i wonder if they put um the you know the jerry springer and all that crap in the um [lipsmack] in the reality are those reality show or those 

437.27 438.93 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

443.61 444.54 B: (( mm i )) 

445.28 446.45 B: (( don't know )) 

445.36 448.63 A: i don't know how much reality th- th- they're you know 

448.59 450.21 A: blessed with either [sigh] 

448.68 450.84 B: right right 

450.13 453.68 A: um but those people certainly see- you couldn't imagine that 

453.54 454.83 A: [sigh] you know 

454.61 469.21 A: well that's s- that's s- how how on why on earth would you go and air your dirty laundry [sigh] on t._v. but a- again there's a whole lot of pumping up behind the scenes saying well go ahead say that yeah go ahead start this fight go ahead p- put it up there that she slept her you know father da da da da da [laughter] [sigh] 

459.46 460.45 B: right 

468.14 477.50 B: right i well i think it's partially just the opportunity to get a free trip to some other city and stay in a nice hotel and [sigh] y- y- you know 

477.91 483.81 B: [mn] probably if all your friends know that you're just going on there to tell a funny story then 

483.90 485.32 B: maybe you don't care 

484.83 491.22 A: [laughter] oh i'm sure that's all of it so that explains why the people go on but what explains why people watch [sigh] i mean [sigh] 

490.76 491.81 B: right 

491.06 502.35 A: you're watching 'cause you're a sociologist you're fascinated w- with with human behavior so am i i simply don't have time to watch it [sigh] and uh like i said these people drive me crazy why do you think it's so popular these are like the number one shows in the u._s. 

496.14 497.05 B: right 

503.15 511.02 B: [noise] it yeah it's probably just voyeurism and that you know the ability to see someone that is worse supposedly worse of than you you know they're 

505.34 506.45 A: yeah 

509.79 511.48 A: [laughter] 

510.87 520.10 B: everyone's cheating on them or or whatever their problem might be and then you can get a little boost and feel good and smart and [sigh] everything like that 

516.09 517.28 A: definitely 

519.13 531.22 A: well see see that's what i would definitely would credit those uh like uh you know bottom bot- uh bottom end shows you know the jerry springers and all that these people you know look like they've just rolled out of their trailers this morning [sigh] but um 

525.60 526.78 B: mhm
