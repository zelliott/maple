4.12 5.52 B: hi robin i'm laurie 

6.50 7.24 A: hi laurie 

7.22 8.04 B: hi 

8.36 10.48 B: um are we supposed to go over each topic 

13.75 14.93 A: i'm not sure 

15.18 17.32 B: okay um 

17.44 18.52 B: well 

18.63 27.85 B: uh i i of that list i would say probably the worst habit is smoking because it damages your health and it 

27.97 32.86 B: bothers people that are surrounding you and it's pretty much a hot topic these days 

33.04 36.52 A: that's true and and alcohol would be my choice 

36.97 37.98 B: that's true 

37.42 37.78 A: of 

37.92 39.84 A: of the worst habit because 

40.23 42.45 A: it it kills too 

42.27 46.85 B: ah espe- alcohol impairs your judgment 

46.87 47.95 A: that's true 

47.75 53.73 B: not too smart to drive or uh participate in in activities while you're drunk 

53.40 58.36 A: and then i guess smoking is the slow killer 

58.95 59.73 B: yes 

60.35 69.50 B: that's a bad habit though a lot people they have to have that cigarette first thing in the morning last thing at night or after they eat it's like dependent habit 

69.53 70.04 A: yeah 

70.42 70.95 B: um 

70.42 71.14 A: let's pray 

71.95 80.05 B: um hm i'm trying to think what else is on that list gossiping i guess isn't that bad because you can just turn away or not listen to it 

79.74 80.59 A: that's true 

80.70 82.43 A: can't believe everything you here 

82.21 85.01 B: that's true um 

86.62 88.23 B: trying to think what else is on that list 

89.07 89.88 A: (( )) 

90.40 93.22 B: uh gossiping overeating 

93.07 94.17 A: yes it was 

93.37 93.87 B: um 

94.44 96.66 B: that that is a bad habit but uh 

97.20 98.31 B: uh i 

98.45 105.31 B: i- i guess it all depends on where you are at the start if you're over weight to begin with and you know it's bad for your health 

105.93 109.27 A: yeah and then some people inherit it throughout their family 

109.11 114.02 B: that's true i mean there's the opposite end of the spectrum is when 

114.12 119.44 B: you under eat or you have an eating disease where you know you get too thin 

119.36 120.08 A: that's true 

121.35 121.80 B: hm 

124.06 125.98 B: hm what else is on that list 

126.82 129.70 B: gossiping smoking drinking eating 

130.14 134.48 A: i didn't pay much attention i was hurrying trying to get my pen because this is my first 

134.88 137.56 B: this my first one too 

134.92 135.72 A: first survey 

136.60 139.62 A: i'm learning right along with you 

139.44 141.80 B: um 

142.30 145.33 B: i guess we were just supposed to talk about the topics and 

146.54 150.26 B: hm i guess we have to keep talking for a certain period of time 

150.26 150.80 A: yeah 

151.33 155.31 A: i think alcoholism was probably the the worst 

155.53 156.48 A: on my list 

157.25 160.89 A: because you know it it can be handed down through the family 

162.05 163.26 A: alcoholism 

163.68 165.84 A: you know if you're raised up in a family that 

166.32 169.19 A: got alcohol in it then i'm sure 

169.65 172.57 A: probably five times out of ten you're liable to drink 

172.68 173.76 A: you know yourself 

176.30 178.68 B: yeah that's true and i think that uh 

179.15 184.35 B: you know as as a habit it is a bad one to have because if you can't function 

184.49 189.36 B: without drinking then you know it's not a good quality life 

189.32 189.76 A: right 

190.23 193.18 A: or for the the children that's in the home either 

193.48 194.93 B: yes it effects everybody 

194.88 195.47 A: right 

195.66 198.72 A: the adults can like get away from it but the children can't 

198.88 200.04 B: mhm that's true 

202.07 206.18 A: well it's just like the smoke too you know the children can't get away from the smoke 

206.83 212.87 A: and i see people in cars you know going down the road with the windows up and while they got cigarettes going and the kids in car 

213.61 214.55 B: yeah 

214.30 218.41 A: that makes me you know i don't like that they could at least role the window down 

222.00 231.43 B: uh the lady strapping her kid in you making sure the kid is all safe and then she gets in the car and lights up and the window is closed 

229.36 229.74 A: yeah 

230.05 230.42 A: yeah 

230.79 231.49 A: that's true 

231.73 233.49 B: damaging that poor kids health 

233.52 234.03 A: right 

235.44 237.67 A: you should have fresh air to breath 

239.00 241.58 A: you should have a choice though anyway huh 

241.40 244.32 B: yeah i mean with all the studies that they have it's just 

245.01 246.81 B: beneficial to keep it out of 

247.13 248.14 B: the children's 

248.74 251.75 B: air until their old enough to make their own decisions 

251.80 254.69 A: yeah because their air outside is bad enough without 

254.85 255.87 A: you know polluting 

256.16 257.12 A: inside air 

257.57 258.21 B: that's true 

259.18 261.79 B: i guess smoking are pretty bad habits 

262.37 262.81 A: yeah 

262.41 264.33 B: they usually go hand in hand too 

264.08 273.47 A: that's true it sure does go to a bar and everybody who's drinking is usually smoking and if not they're smoking anyway with all the smoke in there 

264.99 265.50 B: yeah 

275.86 276.52 B: um 

277.08 283.89 B: i i really don't i don't remember what the rest of the list said but uh i think of that list smoking and drinking were pretty much the worst habits 

283.77 285.55 A: yeah i do too 

287.04 289.01 A: and there's a there's a lot of people that 

289.36 290.57 A: drink and drive 

291.72 292.63 B: yeah uh 

292.27 294.91 A: and that endangers everybody that they pass 

296.18 299.33 B: i mean if if you drink and you get behind the wheel it's just 

299.81 302.55 B: you're endangering even if nothing happens you're still 

302.87 306.22 B: endangering everything that's around you and also you're own life 

306.09 306.92 A: that's true 

308.50 309.78 A: and innocent people 

310.34 312.12 A: that's not expecting it 

312.89 313.81 B: hm that's true 

317.84 319.88 B: i'm reading this email it doesn't say 

321.08 321.98 B: how long 

322.20 326.24 B: conversation is supposed to be but the computer will kick in and tell us when we're supposed to end it 

326.28 327.53 A: yeah i think it 

327.64 331.56 A: whenever i read it from four it was like twenty minutes or something like that 

331.73 334.08 B: wow 

333.11 334.96 A: i think now don't me to it 

336.73 338.85 B: thought i thought it was ten minutes 

339.61 341.27 A: maybe it is i'm not sure 

341.86 346.27 A: obesity that's that's another problem in the world too 

347.05 350.49 A: with a lot of people being obese because they eat out so much 

351.96 357.48 B: yeah they they eat out and now all the meals are a lot larger than they used to be 

358.35 359.64 B: and um 

359.84 361.84 A: greasier 

361.01 363.93 B: yeah and and uh everybody wants you to super size 

364.33 365.04 A: oh yeah 

366.16 368.23 B: hm so i mean it's 

368.36 374.04 B: uh it's getting a little ridiculous every time you go out to eat it's so much food and you don't want to waste it 

373.75 375.65 A: that's true give me a doggy bag 

374.53 374.93 B: g- 

375.46 381.81 B: because we were brought up you know there is starving people in china you have to eat everything so 

380.58 381.10 A: yeah 

383.23 384.10 A: that's true 

384.26 384.77 B: mhm 

386.24 386.93 B: um 

387.45 388.87 B: man the the 

389.35 392.29 B: computer went so fast i didn't catch what the whole list was 

393.45 394.64 B: um 

394.42 402.34 A: heard it was uh gossip which that don't endanger nobody like you said you can just turn the turn the cheek you know the other way 

402.57 405.98 B: yeah i mean it's not a good habit to have but it's certainly not the worst 

408.09 408.81 B: um 

412.59 420.09 A: you can always you know just turn the other cheek and don't pay it no attention and don't spread it further and then it can stop there 

420.98 428.07 A: you know other people will spread it for you you don't have to some people thrive on gossip 

428.33 429.13 B: that's true 

429.20 431.04 A: hey it reminds me of a soap opera 

432.70 435.81 B: it can get that bad trying to keep all the stories straight 

436.33 442.42 A: that's true and being everybody who tells the story will add a little more to it and a little more to it and while 

443.20 446.83 A: it ain't no telling what it would be by the time it reaches the end of the line 

449.68 451.01 B: i think uh 

451.13 455.54 B: it it definitely is a bad habit but out of that whole list that they gave us 

456.03 458.90 B: i think the ones that are more of a danger to your health 

459.78 460.69 B: are um 

461.30 464.23 B: are worse like smoking drinking overeating 

464.17 464.64 A: yeah

470.74 471.26 B: yeah 

471.22 473.14 A: it's never known to hurt you anyway 

477.65 486.68 B: the drinking and overeating and what not you you're harming yourself and you're harming other people you know with gossip i- i- i- you can choose to ignore it 

482.60 483.00 A: yeah 

486.76 487.54 A: that's true
