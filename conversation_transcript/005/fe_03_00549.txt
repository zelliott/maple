29.86 37.29 A: yeah i have here the last week just watching the uh try outs the uh auditions those are hilarious 

35.54 36.02 B: right 

45.77 46.12 A: uh-huh 

45.97 50.88 B: and american idol so i ended up taping american idol and then i'll have to watch that 

51.31 51.85 B: um 

52.01 52.56 B: i guess 

52.73 53.19 B: (( )) 

53.45 53.75 B: (( )) 

53.86 58.94 B: whenev- whenever there is another reality show on i guess i'm a reality show junkie at this point 

58.66 59.71 A: are you really 

59.57 63.28 B: yeah i watch the uh survivor fear factor 

63.90 65.11 B: dog eat dog 

64.93 66.21 A: i watch 

65.33 66.46 B: ba- bachelorette 

67.65 71.06 A: i watch fear factor a few times but it kind of grosses me out so 

72.44 72.79 A: i don't 

72.45 74.62 B: i don't like the part where they are they are eating 

74.61 75.22 A: yeah 

75.00 75.48 B: um 

75.80 78.65 B: those gross things i do not like that part 

76.76 77.65 A: yeah 

79.09 79.61 B: um 

79.73 82.60 B: usually it happens -cause i'm eating dinner when that comes on 

83.14 85.16 B: so i have to change the channel sometimes 

84.51 86.35 A: oh 

85.93 86.61 B: but um 

87.18 89.07 B: why do you think that they are so popular 

90.43 91.36 A: you know i guess 

91.48 96.07 A: just because it's real people you know and and people can relate to those real people and 

96.84 97.95 A: i don't know what do you think 

98.24 99.08 B: um 

99.24 103.30 B: i think that it it's not because it's staged and people are just 

101.96 102.51 A: mhm 

103.54 104.05 B: um 

104.65 105.70 B: uh y- h- just 

106.04 107.87 B: reacting to their 

108.05 109.93 B: their natural reactions they are just 

109.69 110.43 A: yeah 

110.07 114.92 B: presenting their natural reactions and you would think is that how i would react 

115.21 115.71 B: um 

115.80 119.24 B: it makes you think about yourself too and how you would 

119.42 121.10 B: uh react in that situation 

121.13 121.56 A: yeah 

121.71 122.02 A: yeah 

121.92 123.59 B: and what decisions you would make 

123.38 124.13 A: right 

123.77 125.31 B: if you were in that situation 

126.19 126.84 B: u- um 

127.12 128.75 B: that's it's kind of why i like it 

128.84 129.47 A: yeah 

130.39 137.91 A: i like well i like like i said i like the american idol because it's so funny so far but i didn't watch it last time so i mean i i watched the last um 

134.14 135.52 B: it's funny 

138.42 141.18 A: the last little bit of the last show to see who won 

141.30 141.71 B: uh-huh 

141.85 144.85 A: but um i never really got in to it but i think i will this time 

145.38 150.28 B: yeah i think i'm going to follow that one too now i tried to watch that show millionaire that was 

151.03 157.09 B: in one of the current raves right now and i watched it once or twice and for some reason that particular one did not get 

153.11 154.99 A: yeah 

157.21 157.62 B: um 

158.08 159.33 B: wasn't interested in it 

159.43 161.08 A: hum 

159.47 162.09 B: for some reason just because i guess it was uh 

162.31 163.72 B: basically a lie 

163.38 170.16 A: yeah you know i heard that it just came out a few days ago that he was gay 

164.34 164.85 B: um 

165.31 165.81 B: so i didn't 

169.96 170.72 B: oh really 

170.49 171.90 A: did you hear that 

171.51 173.12 B: i did not hear that 

172.23 181.40 A: yeah my brother was telling me it is all over the news and stuff that um just like three days ago it came out that he is actually gay in real life and that he has a boyfriend 

181.16 181.81 B: oh really 

181.71 186.36 A: so it was not only a lie that he wasn't a millionaire but there's 

186.10 186.68 B: right 

186.69 187.71 A: a whole lot more 

188.00 194.39 B: i wonder if they knew that when they you know re- you think they would research someone's background and and interview people 

194.50 199.92 B: that are going to be on a reality show like that and you know learn more about them before they cast them 

200.05 200.87 A: yeah 

201.05 201.50 B: you know 

201.66 202.35 A: you would think 

202.05 203.04 B: so what is your favorite 

203.28 204.19 B: reality show 

203.98 213.00 A: oh pretty much survivor um like i said i only watch a few of them so it would have to be survivor 

206.86 207.42 B: survivor 

209.77 210.53 B: mhm 

212.39 217.78 B: i think that is my favorite too um i'm looking forward to the one that is going to be starting up in february 

217.32 218.26 A: yeah so 

217.91 218.43 B: um 

218.63 219.98 B: where are they going this time 

220.52 221.20 B: uh um 

221.06 221.92 A: i don't remember 

222.32 223.38 B: not africa 

224.21 225.63 B: because they were there 

225.24 226.63 A: they they were already there 

225.88 226.13 B: the 

226.38 227.28 B: the amazon 

231.59 231.94 B: yes 

235.33 235.81 B: mhm 

235.78 236.29 A: and um 

238.92 239.87 B: oh w- 

242.22 244.55 A: watched it in between and to see who won 

245.04 245.55 B: right 

245.17 247.14 A: but i didn't even catch where they were going to be 

247.41 253.33 B: i mean it's kind of difficult with that with survivor because they usually have a couple of months break 

247.47 248.60 A: i haven't even seen any 

253.50 254.07 A: yeah 

253.56 254.40 B: in between 

254.77 258.45 B: and you kind of forget forget about it but maybe that's keeping it 

258.56 259.08 B: going 

258.95 266.16 A: i haven't even seen any of the um commercials yet for it so i don't get (( )) did you 

259.22 260.44 B: too 

263.07 265.51 B: mhm i did just start seeing them 

265.87 266.37 B: mhm 

266.28 267.22 A: okay well maybe i 

266.66 270.42 B: now who wants to be a millionaire did you watch that with regis philbin

274.30 276.02 B: mhm 

277.01 281.76 B: yeah we we watched it as well it was on a lot it was on like three times a week 

281.76 284.67 A: yeah but it's not on anymore is it

293.95 294.25 A: (( )) 

297.10 300.99 B: i think one time i watched about ten or fifteen minutes of it but that was a good show 

299.86 300.79 A: yeah 

301.58 302.19 B: as well 

302.52 303.60 A: what was the other um 

302.76 303.45 B: i liked that 

303.77 304.71 A: the other one um 

305.83 307.18 A: with that lady 

307.50 308.38 B: you know meredith 

309.79 310.31 B: meredith 

310.50 310.98 A: yeah 

310.88 311.33 B: her name 

311.69 312.53 A: what was the other 

311.71 313.64 B: now did you ever watch the big brother 

314.37 314.79 A: uh 

314.92 315.46 A: no 

315.57 318.54 A: i watched a couple episodes but i never really got in to 

319.22 320.41 A: in to those 

320.59 325.42 B: you never got in to that one now i watched it the first time it came up um the first show 

321.42 322.16 A: no 

325.40 326.30 A: yeah 

325.80 329.32 B: first big brother series i guess and then when 

329.75 335.93 B: you know what is that one and then i tried to get in to the second one and i wasn't able to some of those it seems like the first 

336.16 337.34 B: series is the best 

337.46 338.39 A: yeah 

337.46 339.44 B: for some reason and then 

339.81 340.29 B: um 

340.77 343.40 B: kind of lose interest and it might be the novelty of the 

343.52 344.56 B: particular um 

345.67 348.26 B: you know particular show 

347.24 353.61 A: see maybe my my brother watched it faithfully every night it was on and then the second one he didn't watch it hardly at all 

354.28 354.74 B: uh-huh 

354.41 357.76 A: but it didn't interest him either so 

357.59 357.96 B: nope 

358.26 362.79 B: do you like the um surv- uh do you like the uh reality shows better than the regular t._v. shows 

362.74 367.31 A: um no not really do you 

364.96 365.38 B: no 

367.16 370.66 B: i think i do um just because it it keeps me 

371.00 376.08 B: interested um because you never know what is going to happen and if people are just 

376.23 379.00 B: you know reacting to situations that are presenting 

379.15 381.72 B: presented to them as opposed to acting 

380.07 380.60 A: right 

381.87 384.15 B: um for some reason it kind of uh 

384.55 385.00 B: you know 

385.47 388.49 B: interests me a little bit more but i do watch the uh regular shows 

385.51 385.85 A: right 

388.50 388.85 A: yeah 

388.61 389.20 B: too 

389.60 390.14 B: um 

396.96 398.81 A: not what someone is paying them to do so 

397.11 397.61 B: mhm 

399.40 399.81 B: right 

399.44 402.05 A: that kind of makes it interesting 

401.64 402.11 B: mhm 

402.93 407.06 B: i know it i guess there will be some new ones coming up i'm sure since it is the big 

407.30 409.34 B: the big rave right now um 

408.73 409.21 A: oh yeah 

410.54 416.99 B: yeah i i don't know i can't really relate personally to you know like the fear factor or the survivor where they are 

417.26 418.44 B: you know out in the 

418.54 420.31 B: on some island or 

420.42 420.89 B: doing 

421.09 428.25 B: stunts like that but you can react you can relate to the situations that they have to deal with and the decisions that they make 

428.61 429.01 B: you know 

435.46 435.96 B: right 

437.08 439.44 A: that are going behind this person's back to 

439.81 440.51 A: try to get 

441.25 443.21 A: just like a big drama you know 

443.34 443.90 B: right

476.30 479.00 B: you know know that there is someone just like that 

479.34 481.08 B: and it kind of makes it even more funny 

481.89 493.59 A: oh i know i sit and just laughed for two hours or however long it was on an hour last night and just laughed -cause it was so hilarious these people that could actually think that they can sing and they would sit there and argue
