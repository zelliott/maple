0.57 2.71 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] hi i'm marla 

2.38 4.37 A: [lipsmack] i'm jenny how are you doing 

3.83 5.58 B: fine [sigh] 

5.43 7.10 A: [sigh] have you done this before 

6.50 8.90 B: no this is my first time how about you 

8.58 19.39 A: oh this is the second call i've got now let me tell you first that supposedly [sigh] i i think i screwed up on the last one 'cause i've heard that you're supposed to talk until they tell you to stop 

10.09 11.18 B: really 

18.80 19.82 B: uh-huh 

19.68 21.36 A: so it's about ten minutes 

21.35 25.99 B: okay well i guess we can start talking they want us to talk about 

25.55 26.74 A: iraq 

26.12 30.84 B: right if we if we think uh what our thoughts are about if we think that 

30.37 31.93 A: should be disarmed 

31.37 34.14 B: right [sigh] well [laughter] 

33.47 35.97 A: or do you think it's a priority or not mm 

35.54 37.80 B: [sigh] um i do 

37.77 52.55 B: [sigh] uh but it's so hard to know what to think and believe because you're we're i mean i feel we're hearing all these different sides and [sigh] i don't know [sigh] how much has been filtered out by politics and [sigh] and things like that 

52.39 62.82 A: [sigh] well yeah i'm worried too that george is pushing too hard [sigh] that um i think he should wait for the inspectors to do their job for a l- you know a little while at least they haven't been over there that long [sigh] 

60.64 64.91 B: i definitely [sigh] yeah i definitely think that [sigh] 

64.46 69.44 A: and he's like let's go let's go now and the whole world is not behind him on this 

69.05 75.06 B: [sigh] yeah [sigh] i think he should wait because um [sigh] um things like this 

74.93 89.56 B: take time in other words it and plus even if i feel if they are resisting [sigh] that if they push slowly and give them time [sigh] you know until they are at the very last straw 

89.48 90.39 A: mhm 

89.71 92.33 B: you know patience is important 

92.05 99.95 A: [sigh] yeah well i don't think we should attack them [sigh] unless they have a u._n. sanction because then that makes you no better than they are 

99.55 107.56 B: [sigh] yeah not only that [sigh] but if we attack too soon without other countries [sigh] uh that 

105.77 108.59 A: yeah that's why he needs a u._n. sanction 

107.43 120.07 B: y- yeah that's just too risky because [sigh] if we wait long enough until we get more evidence probably [sigh] the important countries they'll be convinced 

119.31 120.40 A: mhm 

120.18 122.77 B: but if they don't yeah 

120.51 133.18 A: we have got to give them a chance if you keep pushing like this it's like he's mr texas highshow here he wants to run off and you know shoot from the hip and everybody wants to just wait and give the inspectors a chance mhm 

132.12 135.71 B: [sigh] yeah [sigh] uh yeah i agree with that i think that um 

136.09 149.01 B: [sigh] the you know [sigh] w- time really isn't not on our side because it's not like [sigh] you know they're threatening or have done something you know so [sigh] it just seems i agree about hurrying [sigh] um 

148.78 157.59 B: because we are talking about human lives my son is seventeen [sigh] he's going to be eighteen in may [sigh] so of course that's going to bother me 

157.08 160.43 A: he's going to have to [mn] sign up for the selective service 

160.01 162.39 B: probably and i even heard 

161.38 163.67 A: well that's a lie he has to sign up 

163.03 167.54 B: yeah well i heard something about i thought the draft wasn't even 

167.33 171.99 A: no there is no draft at this time but you have to register if you're a man 

168.79 169.87 B: mhm 

171.13 172.85 B: oh is that what it is [lipsmack] 

172.01 174.24 A: yeah at least that's what it always was 

174.01 174.98 B: oh 

175.14 188.58 A: [sigh] on your eighteenth birthday unless they've changed the law it was always you had to you had to register because my niece is in the national guard right now and when nine eleven happened [sigh] she had just started her first year at college three weeks later she's down new york city 

175.43 176.17 B: but 

177.64 180.59 B: [sigh] well no that might that might be and so 

181.57 182.82 B: really 

188.90 191.98 A: working on the pile and guarding the dang city 

191.51 192.69 B: really 

192.25 194.59 A: her entire first year of college was awash 

194.42 195.74 B: oh my goodness 

195.65 197.45 A: she was down the entire year 

197.84 212.84 B: [sigh] well yeah and like i think that if we get it's kind of like a court um [sigh] a court thing you know how the all the evidence needs to be out and [mn] he seems to have part of it [sigh] but 

207.59 208.71 A: mhm 

211.91 213.57 A: he's too much of a rush 

213.03 215.06 B: yeah too much of a rush and 

214.18 222.56 A: if he lets those inspectors do their job i mean there's only so many places they can hide the stuff and if they keep pushing and pushing they're eventually going to catch him 

218.94 220.00 B: yeah 

222.34 223.91 B: [sigh] yeah right and the 

223.00 225.23 A: they can only keep moving it so much 

224.65 238.76 B: right and there's a chance the longer they push him [sigh] you know it th- there's a chance they may change their mind and realise okay [sigh] you know when other countries hear this and they've given us opportunity after opportunity 

238.56 249.61 B: there's a chance we may not even have to go to war [sigh] if they do you know change their mind as far as giving in because they real- and as we know the more countries that join the more likely they are 

241.33 242.29 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

249.64 255.32 B: to not want to go to war 'cause they'll realise that they're just so outnumbered it's ridiculous [lipsmack] 

255.15 257.58 A: i know but it might reach a point where 

257.74 259.24 A: [sigh] i don't know because 

259.27 265.92 A: the stuff they have can be carried around in tanker trucks and one tanker truck [lipsmack] is enough to kill half the damn state 

266.37 267.25 B: the 

266.44 271.25 A: or half the country like anthrax one tanker truck of anthrax could kill half the world 

270.65 271.64 B: uh-huh 

271.49 274.64 A: and it's not hard to hide a tanker truck unfortunately 

273.82 282.54 B: [sigh] well you know what i'm wondering is you're saying that iraqis are [sigh] hiding it by by driving it around well what i don't understand is this w- 

279.56 280.45 A: (( yes )) 

282.45 296.24 B: like [sigh] if we send a whole bunch of people over there you know twenty four hours a day [sigh] the country's not that huge it's not like you know the united states [laughter] or anything [sigh] why couldn't they keep a watch on every tanker truck there is 

290.43 292.19 A: (( mhm this is true )) 

295.90 299.95 A: well then you're talking thousands of people not just the few dozen that's over there 

299.32 311.36 B: [sigh] w- yeah well here's the thing [sigh] um if you think of it technically it's either a thousand thousands of people go over or we risk hundreds of thousands in war you know 

309.82 311.22 A: [sigh] well see that that's 

311.18 313.80 A: that's an option but the problem with that is 

313.70 317.80 A: well they have accepted a few dozen maybe a couple of hundred 

317.64 329.55 A: will they accept a thousand foreigners poking about their country making 'em show their papers what's the hell's in your truck [sigh] they might not accept that and then if they refuse to accept that what do you do go kick their butts 

329.20 343.22 B: [sigh] well yeah if we do that then we'd have to have war where i agree we're putting ourselves in a corner unless they tried to sl- you know [laughter] slowly bring in you know what i'm saying i mean [sigh] of course that's we don't know all the details but 

343.28 357.83 B: right if you did like a thousand over there but unless they you know try to push him slowly like well you know we're going to have to bring a hundred more over you know and i don't know they'd go to war on that you know but you're right the minute they said no more 

357.92 366.51 B: [sigh] you know people over they'd have to there'd be another step [sigh] you know but th- you know then they'd have to do even more [sigh] but you know it just 

361.61 362.57 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

365.71 368.61 A: yeah where's the last step that's the problem 

367.25 379.65 B: [sigh] yeah yeah but i basically i think over all when you have the majority of americans the majority of the world not really agreeing with you yet [lipsmack] 

378.69 381.09 A: (( mhm then it's a mistake definitely )) 

379.74 384.53 B: then it- it's got to be and bush [mn] sounds a little deluded 

384.19 398.66 A: yeah you can't go off on your high horse and [sigh] i mean yeah he's the president and yeah he's supposedly going to do what's right for the country but sometimes i get the feeling that he's just trying to make up for his father's mistake in not kicking the guy's ass and finishing off in the first place 

398.51 403.88 B: [sigh] well that's true uh that could be true and also [sigh] um 

403.44 408.24 A: or the supposed plot to kill his father is he like just after revenge 

408.35 417.25 B: [laughter] well you know that that's a thought but i don't know it's just it seems that of course the people whose family's lives are going to 

417.02 424.65 B: be concerned but [sigh] you know it he doesn't seem to care about that he almost seems a little bit immature [sigh] um and 

422.70 427.15 A: mhm mhm yeah he's yeah he's just like a little boy gotta gotta do it now 

426.91 435.79 B: yeah and you know some people even thought at first that he might have been doing it to secure the next election [sigh] you know 

434.67 447.92 A: well except for his popularity's dropping [mn] i mean right after nine eleven it was supposedly at ninety percent [sigh] but the only reason it was at ninety percent was because of nine eleven and [mn] everybody in the country was like one solid unit them against you know us against them 

437.02 437.96 B: (( yeah )) 

439.66 440.70 B: mhm 

447.46 449.49 B: yeah you have to do that 

448.71 450.85 A: and uh now he's down to 

451.12 460.26 A: [lipsmack] i think i read in the paper this morning fifty nine percent which is still abnormally high for somebody in his position at this time of his presidency [sigh] but it is slowly dropping 

455.22 459.12 B: but it but it's dropping yeah 

460.16 461.73 B: [sigh] yeah [sigh] 

460.76 464.65 A: but i mean he if he screws us up he won't get elected again 

464.75 467.07 A: but he's also ignoring the economy 

466.79 468.09 B: yeah [sigh] oh 

467.77 472.82 A: i mean it's like he's trying to draw away the attention away from it it's like we're not stupid this isn't working 

468.14 469.07 B: (( [laughter] hell )) 

472.35 481.03 B: [sigh] well yeah it you know [mn] when you said that it brought a thought you're right [sigh] it if he is doing it to distract the economy [sigh] we aren't that dumb 

480.99 488.99 B: [sigh] i mean [laughter] you know americans we're not going to be that easily distracted [sigh] and it it it's like he maybe he thinks we're that dumb but 

488.56 489.62 A: mhm 

488.87 499.62 B: i mean he does have some people for this far as i mean for people that aren't don't agree with him because of [sigh] the he j- still does have that high fif- that fifty nine percent [sigh] but um 

499.38 507.73 B: that's an interesting thought that he might [laughter] be doing it to distract from the economy [sigh] but he might get himself in a worse mess 

502.72 503.85 A: mhm 

507.39 517.59 A: yeah well yeah war used to be a great fixer of the economy go to war everybody's got jobs lots of money all this manufacturing going on to support the war effort [sigh] but war isn't the same as it used to be 

517.54 529.36 A: now it's all falling from a plane planes cost you know how many freaking millions and billions of dollars each every one of those freaking rockets cost a million dollars they're talking like what thirty billion dollars if they have to fight this war 

522.26 523.70 B: [sigh] that's true 

528.93 531.31 B: yeah it's totally different now 

530.62 545.45 A: yeah it's not the same thing at all and then he's doing all these stupid tax cuts i think what the hell is with that i'd rather pay [sigh] uh my extra two hundred i mean i just noticed my pay check [sigh] went up two dollars so i went and checked it out and like oh federal tax rate went down that's stupid 

532.23 533.50 B: yeah and our 

545.32 553.31 A: [sigh] so i'm getting an extra two dollars a week whoa that's a hundred and four dollars a year i'd rather the government keep it along with two hundred other million people's hundred and four dollars a week 

553.29 562.00 A: [sigh] and pay off the national debt this is i mean they're saying they have a surplus [sigh] they have no surplus if you have a hell of a debt selector you have no surplus [sigh] 

561.52 562.70 B: that's true 

562.95 568.95 A: it's like telling your credit card company i'm sorry i have a surplus this week but you don't count you don't get any of the money 

568.74 581.86 B: [sigh] [sigh] well you know because of that that's why a lot of the middle class right the chunk out of the middle americans [sigh] aren't really as much behind bush and of course we know that [sigh] the real majority 

581.72 587.03 B: [mn] did not vote for bush he was the m- he didn't get there by the majority [sigh] um 

583.18 584.33 A: mhm 

586.19 597.54 A: yeah the electoral college process is stupid that was great back in the seventeen hundreds [sigh] when you had no communication no fast rapid transit you don't have that crap now you should go right to the direct one person one vote thing 

590.14 591.30 B: yeah 

594.35 595.28 B: (( mm )) 

597.11 599.89 B: [sigh] yeah [sigh] and uh the thing is
