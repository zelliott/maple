121.26 123.29 A: is it going to tell us when it ends or do we just hang up

126.73 127.36 A: oh really 

127.92 129.92 A: have you ever done this before we this these people

137.90 138.79 A: i don't is there a limit

141.16 142.70 B: an email it said three times 

142.90 143.71 A: oh 

144.53 146.88 B: and chosen to participate in three calls 

146.89 147.38 A: great 

147.93 148.70 A: it is very interesting 

147.97 148.96 B: no telling us what the next 

149.07 150.85 B: subjects are going to be about 

150.39 151.58 A: uh 

153.15 153.45 B: but 

154.36 157.68 B: yeah christmas is definitely my favorite holiday except for the fact that 

158.57 161.37 B: i think people spend way too much money for christmas and 

163.72 166.21 B: really acknowledge what the true meaning of christmas is 

166.29 167.80 A: yup it is all commercialized 

169.01 169.86 A: i agree with that 

171.20 172.58 B: some people are so hard to 

172.98 174.40 B: to buy for too 

175.78 177.96 A: that is why i have gift certificates 

179.31 183.64 B: i think it would be much simpler if if people would really acknowledge what it is about and just 

183.76 184.06 B: spend 

184.35 185.04 B: more time 

185.19 187.68 B: you know family quality family time together and 

187.83 188.18 A: right 

188.65 189.54 B: and put out all the 

189.80 190.55 B: expensive gifts 

191.48 192.02 A: but 

192.17 193.69 A: that would help me 

195.60 196.31 B: my kids were 

196.42 199.95 B: hoping for a white christmas this year and we didn't get that 

199.83 201.58 A: oh we had a little bit of snow here on christmas
