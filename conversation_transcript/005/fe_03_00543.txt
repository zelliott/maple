17.59 20.92 B: um it wh- it something that we find offensive is that what it was 

21.05 23.46 A: it was like personal habits that you find annoying 

23.95 25.80 B: i think smoking is kind of annoying 

26.39 27.48 B: out in public 

27.22 31.94 A: yeah i see how it is in like public but like it you know in the comfort of your own house or like in your car 

32.34 35.71 A: i think smoking should be done away with at restaurants too especially for people who don't smoke 

36.20 37.45 B: well i'm i'm from 

37.54 40.06 B: the midwest and they haven't really banned smoking 

40.16 40.64 A: oh really

51.71 54.05 A: yeah well definitely understandably 

51.76 52.18 B: in it

76.62 77.53 A: yeah exactly 

77.70 79.19 B: anyway um 

78.17 78.61 A: because it's 

80.33 81.91 B: not going to the gym regularly 

81.99 82.32 A: yeah 

82.09 83.99 B: i don't think that that's a pet peeve of mine 

84.14 86.70 A: yeah it really doesn't bother me when people you know 

87.06 87.44 A: yup 

87.27 89.44 B: people can do to themselves what they want 

89.43 90.10 A: exactly 

90.08 92.29 B: i think as long as it doesn't affect me i don't care 

92.62 92.97 A: yeah 

93.19 96.37 B: um i well what was the over overeating 

96.64 99.37 A: yeah i don't i don't really do that either but ah 

98.88 100.54 B: gossiping was one of them 

100.34 101.71 A: yeah gossiping was the first one 

102.60 105.28 B: gossiping smoking overeating 

102.63 103.35 A: that's 

105.42 105.72 A: yeah 

106.26 108.16 B: not going to the gym regularly 

109.48 111.04 B: and was swearing one of them 

111.47 112.03 A: um 

112.32 113.38 A: i don't think so but 

113.75 115.60 A: in public yeah that bothers me as well 

116.24 118.74 B: well i think i think there's a time and a place for everything 

118.82 119.13 A: yeah 

120.56 127.38 A: but um i don't know what was the firs- oh gossiping yeah that drives me crazy when people are talking about you know you or others behind their back 

127.82 130.17 B: and i'm sure you're thinking about women when you say that right 

129.76 132.32 A: yeah well not all the time 

132.51 133.38 B: most of the time 

133.82 135.20 A: yeah most of the time actually 

134.32 135.38 B: nine times out of ten 

135.72 137.83 A: and i'm sure you're referring to guys too right 

137.82 138.76 B: oh definitely 

138.86 140.17 A: yeah it goes both ways 

140.43 141.84 B: are you is this your first call 

142.07 145.67 A: yeah this is really kind of weird how l- do you know how long we're suppose to stay on the phone for 

145.56 146.93 B: until they tell us it's over 

147.18 147.82 A: oh alright 

148.21 149.80 A: yeah i just registered today so 

149.87 151.09 B: me too 

150.60 153.10 A: pretty hey that's a pretty quick turn around there 

153.27 153.69 B: yeah 

153.45 157.52 A: and right when they called i couldn't find my pin either it was like i didn't print out the email or anything 

157.71 159.05 B: ah i memorized mine 

157.96 158.60 A: so i was like 

159.14 160.56 A: desperately looking for it 

161.15 162.57 B: so you said that you smoke 

162.65 162.97 A: yeah 

163.62 167.73 B: and but you don't gossip and you don't and you don't go to the gym or you do 

167.85 168.24 A: oh up 

168.45 171.79 A: i don't re i gossip but yeah i mean i don't think anybody really 

171.96 175.56 A: doesn't gossip you know flat out and yeah i go to the gym pretty much everyday 

176.09 178.86 B: so you go to the gym and you gossip and you smoke 

176.28 176.90 A: and eh 

179.39 180.19 B: do you over eat 

179.44 180.25 A: eh 

180.55 181.99 A: um no not really 

182.28 182.68 A: um um 

183.06 184.00 A: i tr- i 

183.11 186.51 B: i guess in i guess in some ways i can find over eating offensive 

186.75 187.25 A: yeah 

187.09 189.45 B: someone's like gouging their face right in front of me and 

189.64 191.12 A: yeah espec- well yes 

190.01 192.05 B: spitting food in my face and 

192.25 194.51 A: and there was another one excessive amounts of alcohol 

195.17 195.80 A: which uh 

195.30 196.23 B: oh yeah 

197.43 200.00 B: well as a college student i think that's that's 

197.46 198.07 A: i 

199.79 206.80 A: yeah i i'm definitely guilty of that but you know there's got to be a point where you know you cut yourself off or you don't let yourself get too you know silly in public 

200.23 201.24 B: pretty much something i've 

207.06 209.36 B: it's definitely something i don't have a problem with so i'm 

209.04 209.38 A: yeah 

209.52 210.28 B: i've dealt with 

210.69 211.24 A: that's good 

211.05 214.97 B: really bad drunks and i've dealt with pretty pretty funny drunks so 

214.87 215.37 A: yeah 

215.59 216.18 B: i don't (( )) 

215.70 216.09 A: i mea- 

216.37 218.05 A: it all depends to each his own 

218.31 222.01 B: yeah are there any on the list that that of personal habits that you 

222.35 223.16 B: find offensive 

223.52 224.39 A: um 

225.38 228.62 A: no not really i try to be an understanding person um you know 

229.75 231.44 A: all people are different you know 

232.10 235.48 A: if somebody you know enjoys just eating a lot that's fine but 

235.70 239.43 A: none of them really bother me and since i'm a smoker smoking doesn't really bother me too much 

239.63 244.10 A: i understand how people would say you know there should be no smoking in restaurants period and stuff like that 

244.78 245.50 A: um 

245.77 249.13 B: it's kind of like having a peeing section of the swimming pool 

246.05 246.47 A: gosh 

249.08 250.31 A: yeah exactly 

250.72 253.27 A: that is yeah that is a funny way to look at it but um 

254.00 258.88 A: gossiping yeah that can get to me because you can't do anything about that and it ends up hurting you in the end 

259.13 261.97 B: oh definitely well i i think that 

262.51 263.96 B: i think that gossiping 

264.59 265.36 B: does more 

266.17 270.57 B: it does more bad than it does good but i think that like gossiping about like celebrities and 

270.78 271.29 A: yeah 

271.19 273.45 B: what not i mean that's always going to be 

274.18 276.80 B: and i don't think you're ever going to stop that but i think smoking 

277.07 278.97 B: you know around people especially like 

277.19 277.71 A: yeah 

279.59 283.34 B: children and i think that's the whole problem with smoking in public 

283.44 283.87 A: yeah 

283.71 285.63 B: that it ar- that it causes oppose 

285.78 286.21 B: i mean 

286.59 290.86 A: yeah and like you said you worked at a as a waitress in a restaurant i mean even even w- 

289.61 290.42 B: yeah 

290.97 294.13 A: you know if you have a smoking section it's going to the smell 

294.25 296.49 A: it's going to travel around the restaurant obviously 

296.13 297.14 B: oh definitely 

297.16 300.64 A: and if you walk into a restaurant usually the whole thing smells like smoke anyway 

300.57 302.82 B: but see the most smokers don't smell that though 

302.95 303.99 A: yeah exactly 

303.53 305.58 B: you know like i said i quit a year ago so i am 

306.15 309.09 B: now but it was really hard at first and i smoked for a while and 

309.14 309.53 A: yeah 

309.56 311.72 B: it's probably the best thing i've ever done for myself 

311.94 312.58 A: yeah i'm 

313.25 315.36 A: i guess you can say i'm a real life smoker 

315.71 318.71 A: i only smoke like you know a couple three four cigarettes a day 

319.01 319.50 B: yeah 

319.52 322.22 A: but um i don't know i'd like to kick the habit completely 

322.64 324.90 B: (( )) i tell you the truth i eh 

325.02 328.37 B: i think that part of all those i think that was the most offensive to me 

328.55 328.88 A: yeah 

329.19 330.18 A: how'd you quit smoking 

329.38 329.63 B: (( )) 

330.62 331.36 B: cold turkey 

331.53 332.22 A: oh really just 

332.42 333.05 A: stopped one day 

333.22 334.12 B: yeah i (( )) 

333.82 334.42 A: wow 

334.52 338.14 B: my boyfriend is a a non smoker has never been a smoker and 

339.54 344.20 B: that kind of had something to do with it too you know i've been wa- i wanted to do it for awhile and 

344.48 344.95 A: oh yeah 

344.80 347.56 B: being with someone who wasn't a smoker that was kind of unfair 

347.76 349.50 A: yeah i guess that makes sense 

349.58 355.84 B: so i guess you know you need a you need a another excuse other than yourself you know being a smoker it's like ew i'm not going to just do it 

355.95 356.54 B: for me but 

356.79 357.12 A: yeah 

358.37 358.70 A: well 

358.40 359.86 B: i think that's a pretty big thing 

360.72 362.59 A: i guess that's about everything on the list i don't 

362.98 364.31 A: really know what we do from here 

365.15 369.62 B: well i i know a lot of people that said they've already that they just hang up after awhile 

369.72 370.30 A: oh really 

369.90 371.83 B: like but then you don't get credited for it 

372.13 372.84 A: oh alright 

373.11 373.51 A: hm 

373.42 375.79 B: so i think this is linguistic and 

376.87 377.17 A: eh 

377.06 378.82 B: each pattern something like that 

379.06 379.46 A: what's that 

379.94 382.30 B: i think it was like linguistic and speech pattern 

382.43 382.94 A: oh yeah 

383.01 384.43 B: something like that so i don't know 

385.07 387.44 A: there's like well there was like a whole list of topics on uh 

385.42 385.94 B: exactly 

387.71 389.21 A: their web site some of them are 

389.40 390.27 A: pretty weird too 

390.51 392.00 B: i didn't get to see any of those 

392.22 392.67 A: um 

394.94 403.93 B: but um but i think that i mean like i said over eating i guess can be um can be kind of offensive like i said if someone is kind of 

404.67 408.21 B: doing it around you i mean it just depends on the type of person you are 

408.36 408.76 A: yeah 

408.94 409.67 A: (( )) 

408.98 412.97 B: personal habits i mean swearing that was not on the list correct 

413.42 416.36 A: uh no i did not think that was on the list actually 

416.70 419.35 B: but is it as one personal i think that that 

419.62 423.27 A: yeah espec- i mean especially in pub- especially in public too 

420.16 421.74 B: right up there with smoking almost 

423.87 424.47 A: because you know 

424.67 424.93 A: (( )) 

425.05 427.78 A: you know some people might not have a problem with it but some people may you know 

428.17 430.05 A: be very easily offended by it so 

430.50 431.04 B: right 

432.05 432.40 A: oh 

433.05 433.52 A: and 

433.84 435.75 A: as for other stuff on the list i don't know 

437.18 442.09 A: well drin- yeah you know as you you say you work in a restaurant drinking you know you see all kinds of people 

442.20 443.91 A: you know there's just some people out there that 

444.35 446.26 A: you know when they drink too much it's a problem 

446.44 450.35 B: oh definitely i mean more more people than not have a problem i think 

450.47 450.82 A: yeah 

451.96 453.08 B: and i i don't know i 

453.56 457.28 B: i've seen my share and i don't even know if i can consider that offensive 

457.56 457.97 A: yeah 

457.65 460.99 B: until until they start the the run of the mouth and 

461.08 461.56 A: yeah 

461.89 465.04 B: that kind of thing but then smoking goes right in hand and hand with drinking 

465.17 465.64 A: yeah 

466.04 468.54 A: but then also again with over drinking um 

469.43 471.92 A: you know it's the alcohol that causes it but really 

472.14 474.65 A: when they're heavily intoxicated that's what brings about 

475.03 477.96 A: all kinds of other pet peeves you know that bother you like you know 

478.29 480.02 A: cussing real loud in public or 

480.38 482.93 A: smoking a lot of cigarettes because i you know they go along together 

483.09 483.98 B: oh definitely 

484.56 485.46 B: definitely 

485.80 489.83 B: i eh it's and like you said you know it's kind of to each his own you know 

489.88 490.25 A: yeah 

490.31 492.92 B: like what what might be offensive to one person definitely 

493.37 495.17 B: might not be to another i mean i know 

495.41 498.34 B: that some peop- i know most of my friends that have a higher tolerance than 

498.52 498.91 A: yeah 

499.74 500.99 B: in that kind of thing and 

501.44 504.77 B: i don't know like i dealing with the public everyday i kind of have to 

505.98 507.04 B: kind of have to
