269.37 269.75 B: uh-huh 

270.00 270.81 A: i like it 

271.04 278.48 A: but i don't do a lot of i don't do a lot of other stuff actually i mean i just pretty much go to work and go home and that's about it 

274.49 275.13 B: mhm 

278.48 278.98 B: yeah huh 

279.65 282.83 A: i should i guess i should find time for exercising i mean 

283.21 287.27 A: i don't really when i was in school i was doing more different things 

287.38 287.85 B: mhm 

288.30 290.74 A: no you never know no (( )) 

289.45 295.19 B: i mean having kids is exercise but your kids are going to get to a point in time where 

292.30 292.98 A: yeah 

295.67 298.49 B: they learn to do stuff based on what you do 

298.95 299.61 A: right 

299.25 303.24 B: so it's like if you read a lot your kids will be good readers if 

303.41 312.05 B: if your you and your husband are college graduates they're more likely to go to college so if you exercise they're more likely to exercise and 

312.24 313.01 B: and eat well 

313.18 313.63 B: i know 

313.45 316.05 A: that's true that's true well we do eat a lot but 

316.33 316.73 B: mhm 

316.42 319.93 A: you don't really see us exercising very much i guess that would be a good thing and 

320.38 323.33 A: my diet it isn't isn't the best but 

322.95 323.41 B: uh-huh 

323.92 325.40 A: isn't that awful (( )) 

324.14 325.37 B: but i mean i think that that 

325.88 327.58 B: helps you ward off 

327.91 329.29 B: colds and stuff but i don't 

329.42 330.01 B: i don't know that 

330.24 331.67 B: there's i don't believe in (( )) 

332.08 339.93 B: the only seasonal illness i think that people have like i have hay fever more in the summer than i have at during i have allergies all year round but in the summer and fall 

338.98 339.57 A: oh wow 

340.55 341.90 B: they're worse 

341.01 341.37 A: yeah 

342.35 342.88 A: yeah 

343.55 348.01 A: yeah i i don't know that i necessarily would believe that people would get more colds and that kind of thing 

348.14 348.57 B: mhm 

348.54 352.32 A: in the win- i mean in the winter or when the seasons change i mean 

352.20 352.61 B: mhm 

352.72 355.53 A: but with kids they get sick any time of year there's really no 

355.67 356.07 B: mhm 

356.49 361.41 A: and i i don't know just from what i've seen a lot a lot of illness are worse in the winter i don't know if that's 

361.68 365.28 A: because of the colds or what i mean especially childhood illnesses 

365.65 366.11 B: so and 

365.67 366.03 A: but 

366.24 369.05 B: there's i mean people get the flu during the winter 

368.72 369.08 A: right 

369.16 371.98 B: you don't really hear of people getting i've never known why it's 

369.37 370.05 A: right

373.14 374.65 B: that's true you get -em in the winter 

375.25 376.57 B: and um 

376.89 378.68 B: i teach college and 

379.45 384.46 B: each year that we get a new crop of freshmen from different parts of the country i find that you know like 

384.61 385.78 B: people get sick at 

386.03 391.98 B: different times and i say to myself now you can't get sick you have to teach them but um 

390.45 391.30 A: right 

392.95 394.71 B: so how did you hear about this 

395.09 396.07 B: um survey

401.81 402.36 B: uh-huh 

402.61 404.44 A: and that leads to it and then i just 

404.73 408.19 A: linked to and then i um clicked to it and it sounded interesting 

408.45 408.88 B: yeah 

409.05 409.38 A: (( ))

454.27 454.69 B: yeah 

455.16 455.72 B: um 

455.16 460.02 A: and on account of (( )) you know enrollment i mean lack of enrollment

468.86 469.38 A: wow 

469.23 473.18 B: so um but uh well that's why you know i mean you know if you're 

473.73 477.10 B: grow up on a farm that's one way for your parents to pay for you to go to school 

477.65 481.44 A: yeah i mean it makes sense i guess i guess it's just what would most schools 

481.77 482.92 A: do with the pigs 

489.76 491.62 B: serve it at barbecues and you name it 

492.14 494.63 B: but it was really weird to have my alma mater 

492.42 492.92 A: oh 

494.78 496.20 B: in the new york times 

496.68 497.33 B: mentioned 

497.69 500.84 B: in connection with payment in pigs 

500.41 502.25 A: well it it probably kind of made 

502.76 505.47 A: i mean if i read about that it would kind of make me feel like my 

505.68 509.24 A: my school is just being made to look worse the people 

509.38 513.18 A: associate with my school being made to look like a bunch of hicks and 

512.65 515.09 B: yeah that's actually a a little bit how i felt 

515.70 518.34 B: but these um write up the next write up 

518.93 519.81 B: um 

520.11 525.82 B: after the times was in a a worse paper the new york post and the new york post made a big thing about how 

523.97 524.31 A: mhm 

526.39 527.74 B: you know otherwise kid- 

527.87 535.06 B: that grow up in rural families often can't afford to go to school and this is one way that they found so it actually made lindenwood look 

535.63 536.00 B: like 

536.21 539.92 B: a good school i can't imagine where i go to school i go to new york university 

540.04 548.80 B: i i know i can't imagine say saint louis u or wash u saying okay that'll be six pigs you know but uh
