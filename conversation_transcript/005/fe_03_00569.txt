44.66 45.99 A: no i didn't enjoy it 

47.49 52.05 B: i think people generally i know i watch it i think because you know something dramatic is going to happen

55.11 58.06 B: something is always exciting going on on the reality show 

58.22 58.51 A: yup

80.91 82.29 B: yeah that's going to be good 

82.54 85.50 B: but i think real world right now is probably one of the most exciting ones 

85.95 86.92 B: like um 

87.50 91.47 B: some of the ones if they don't have anything exciting going on it's hard for you to keep your their 

91.64 93.11 B: it's hard for them to keep your attention 

93.45 94.03 A: uh 

94.24 97.38 B: most of them have something to do with romance too high school reunion 

97.73 99.29 B: they're basically trying to hook up people 

99.60 100.25 A: uh 

100.10 101.77 B: have you even seen the commercial for it

114.90 119.61 B: i don't know they they're doing quite well right now these reality shows but i think people are going to get tired of them after a while 

119.77 121.32 A: i know it's like 

122.26 122.92 A: oh 

123.89 127.81 A: it's like it's new but after a while you get bored with it you want something else 

127.74 131.63 B: exactly i mean like tonight we have maybe two or three to choose from 

131.85 133.08 A: i know it's like 

132.73 133.05 B: no 

133.89 134.62 A: too much 

134.51 134.90 B: yeah 

137.44 139.46 B: but um that's basically why i think people that watch

142.24 142.55 A: yup 

142.26 143.93 B: just so they can live vicariously 

144.12 144.70 A: mhm

147.45 147.97 B: yeah 

148.49 150.14 A: i've watched blind date and 

150.51 154.56 B: oh that's right i think you know i i didn't even realize that blind date is a reality show 

154.78 155.88 A: yeah i think there's a 

155.30 156.11 B: it sure is 

156.34 157.29 A: now that we're on 

159.41 159.89 B: you know 

160.39 162.30 B: i do watch blind date and elimidate 

163.79 165.69 B: would you ever go on a a reality show you think 

167.68 168.24 A: no 

168.89 171.47 B: i don't think they would let me be on my life is too boring 

168.97 169.61 A: i'm too much 

171.66 172.39 A: well i'm 

172.62 174.44 A: too much of a private person i don't like 

175.09 177.30 A: i don't think i'd like people knowing what i'm doing 

177.54 178.04 B: right 

178.13 178.47 A: and 

178.28 178.95 B: that's true too 

178.64 179.84 A: anymore than they have to 

179.91 180.41 B: yeah 

181.48 182.27 B: that's true too 

183.32 185.01 A: i like watching what other people is doing 

185.25 186.83 B: right exactly 

187.35 188.10 B: exactly 

188.84 191.17 B: yeah but i think they're going to be pretty short lived 

191.56 191.84 A: yep 

191.64 193.33 B: because they're over saturating the market 

194.08 195.77 A: what do you think about the osbournes 

196.30 199.48 B: you know i've only watched the osbournes a little and i think it's kind of 

199.63 199.99 B: sick 

200.37 204.29 B: because the house is so dysfunctional and i can't believe they want the world to know that 

204.72 207.75 A: i know and they don't do nothing with the (( )) excuse me 

208.08 208.79 A: hello 

209.47 210.02 B: right 

209.53 209.92 A: eh 

210.27 213.05 B: i think the sickest crime may be the fact that they're doing so well 

213.19 213.95 A: i know 

214.48 216.24 B: and what about the anna nicole show 

216.76 219.42 A: i haven't seen it but i heard it's disgusting 

218.40 219.25 B: oh 

219.70 223.67 B: you ought to be happy you haven't seen it i watched it once just to catch what it was about 

224.28 226.08 B: and it's sickening it's like she is really 

226.67 227.27 B: it's like she's 

228.19 229.45 B: at the bottom of the barrel 

229.75 230.52 A: oh no 

230.70 233.14 B: a- and she has money i don't know quite why she's doing this show 

233.41 235.23 B: but she makes a fool of herself every week 

239.69 242.80 B: i guess there can be some benefits to having a reality show but i don't know
