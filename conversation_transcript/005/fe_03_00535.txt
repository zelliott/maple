12.61 14.74 B: yeah ah yeah hard to say 

14.76 20.87 A: [sigh] yeah well i guess you got to think of some of the possibilities that you know [noise] you you look at [noise] 

21.09 22.01 A: um 

22.45 27.25 A: if you want to say what's worse you need to look at what the um effects of it are 

27.31 29.63 A: [sigh] um what did it say it said gossiping 

30.22 31.52 B: smoking

37.24 38.20 A: okay 

38.50 44.87 A: i think they're to me they're all bad but the reason why i would say that gossiping is worse 

45.16 49.09 A: is that for the most part gossiping it hurts other people 

50.22 52.78 A: that's what i would say [sigh] if you look at like um 

53.30 55.85 A: smoking [lipsmack] you're hurting yourself 

55.76 56.70 B: (( [noise] right )) 

56.10 62.55 A: um there is the there is the effect of secondhand smoke [sigh] but still that's that's a conscious choice that you're making you know 

63.21 67.32 A: overeating's the same drinking alcohol the same gossiping 

67.42 68.45 A: um 

69.11 70.78 A: you're taking someone else 

70.55 72.55 B: [sigh] that's true you're right 

72.29 72.85 A: (( [cough] ))

88.60 99.49 A: [sigh] [mn] yeah is is that what y- is that what you would think or would you i mean i know there's some people who [sigh] they s- they smoke and drink and they say i- it's wrong but it's a habit what's your opinion on that 

98.94 110.04 B: [sigh] [sigh] well um it is bad um as i don't know about you but i'm in florida [sigh] and we just passed a thing that you can't smoke in bars or restaurants 

105.48 107.22 A: mhm 

109.78 110.63 A: (( ahah )) 

110.58 119.69 B: and uh that's all fine and well but they're starting to suffer [sigh] the consequences people don't go out as much 

119.20 120.77 A: [cough] oh really 

120.30 121.41 B: (( yeah )) 

122.18 129.53 B: [sigh] so i have been meaning to look up and see what what happened in california you know they did that a few years ago [sigh] 

127.25 128.10 A: (( okay )) 

129.01 133.67 A: [sigh] they did that in i'm i'm in south carolina now but i'm originally from minnesota 

134.12 137.21 A: and minnesota they did that they had 

137.16 139.33 A: i think it was only after a 

139.18 148.62 A: either either i think it was like after certain hours they could smoke or something like that and i don't i don't know what the long term effects are my brothers both my brothers smoke 

148.40 158.93 A: and i know that my brother once upon a time he said he would only go to b- he wouldn't go to mcdonalds but he would only go to burger king because burger king still or hardee's because hardee's still had a smoking section then 

159.00 160.13 B: oh really 

159.23 160.10 A: (( so )) 

160.12 164.89 A: they they lost my brother but that's see in in the long term i don't know 

164.52 168.52 B: [sigh] yeah see restaurants i don't have a problem with restaurants at all 

168.55 169.60 A: yeah 

169.00 170.00 B: um 

170.08 176.22 B: because i agree if i was eating and i didn't smoke i wouldn't want to smell it [sigh] the bar thing is kind of different 

173.85 174.67 A: (( aha )) 

177.06 178.23 A: oh okay 

178.28 180.73 B: y- you know and the two do 

179.77 181.88 A: they've made it illegal to smoke in bars 

181.76 184.07 B: (( [sigh] yeah [laughter] )) 

183.47 184.26 A: oh 

184.10 192.47 B: unless they don't serve food [sigh] well [mn] then that creates other problems then you have a bunch of people who don't eat and they're partying all night y- 

193.30 198.33 A: oh yeah that's not kind of yeah that's not maybe the situation most people 

194.06 195.21 B: you know what i mean 

198.46 201.75 A: or some people want to be in is that what you're saying uh okay 

198.60 199.37 B: (( [mn] )) 

199.90 200.92 B: right 

201.83 206.93 B: so you know it it ought to be like separate but equal kind of thing 

205.48 206.04 A: (( [cough] )) 

206.81 208.97 A: yeah i kind of you know like i never 

209.38 215.22 A: dreamed that i would i would i'm n- i don't i don't go to bars but i i would kind of think you know that like 

215.29 226.53 A: goes together in the fact that you know if you want to get together after you know a hard day's [sigh] work you know you get together with a couple of friends and you go you get like a whole a scotch and a cigar or something but um 

227.23 231.46 A: um and not just that but that that might show my 

232.13 233.00 A: (( ah )) 

233.28 235.71 A: inexperience in the area but um 

234.70 246.02 B: [sigh] no no you're right though 'cause the way it is now [sigh] you just kind of being ev- every place has a different rule whether you tip up the barstool and you go out front 

246.19 247.03 A: (( ahah )) 

246.24 249.96 B: or or you know they have little placards that you put down 

250.15 251.06 A: mhm 

250.20 254.44 B: [sigh] it's really bizarre because most of the places out front 

254.93 255.70 B: (( [laughter] )) 

256.06 258.15 B: you know what's wrong with this picture 

258.12 263.90 A: oh yeah [sigh] well here's a question for you to think about uh tell me what you think i went to um 

264.09 265.65 A: i'm actually a grad student [lipsmack] 

265.71 269.17 A: and i went to i'm studying russian 

269.18 273.63 A: and i went to it's kind of like a russian club or place to go and just practise your russian in the evenings 

273.53 274.42 B: okay 

273.85 276.15 A: and it's it's at a coffee shop 

276.18 288.87 A: so i went to the coffee shop and i laid my coat down on the it was actually on the table we were sitting at a bunch of different tables well they all wanted to come to this one bigger table so we could sit around and talk for a little bit so i set my coat down on the table 

286.14 286.93 B: okay 

289.20 296.37 A: and then everything i was there for an hour i got up i took my coat and i walked to the library and i smelled cigarette smoke and i thought you know someone's smoking 

296.52 303.38 A: in the library or something i said how can that be or someone really someone who smokes a lot has been in 'cause it was really strong 

303.63 308.39 A: it wasn't like you know y- you kind of sometimes you think oh someone's smoking um 

308.78 310.99 A: but it w- it was really strong and then i 

311.11 312.00 A: (( [mn] ah )) 

312.04 318.03 A: i don't know what i did but i caught like a whiff when i raised up my arm to get a book or something i smelled my coat [sigh] and it was my coat 

318.07 321.32 A: and the reason it was so strong is that it was so close to me um 

321.69 324.93 A: so do you think that's an issue like do people who 

326.28 328.66 B: well i bet that happens a lot 

328.60 329.46 A: yeah 

329.18 330.24 B: i really do 

330.88 331.44 A: (( [cough] )) 

332.52 333.55 B: and 

332.66 335.42 A: i'm j- i'm just curious what you're thinking um 

334.37 343.14 B: yeah no um and i i bet that happens a lot and i feel [sigh] equally as bad for the people who don't smoke and go home smelling like smoke 

343.31 345.49 B: as people who do smoke 

345.94 350.46 B: and but still want to go out and have a good time or go 

349.64 351.29 A: okay yeah [cough] 

350.96 351.69 B: (( [cough] )) 

351.95 354.42 B: 'cause in in my group of friends 

354.53 356.33 B: i'm the only one that smokes 

356.46 357.29 A: okay 

356.47 364.48 B: [sigh] so we go to lunch it's always you know and used to be you go to a non-smoking and i would always do it outside and 

364.10 365.14 A: mhm 

365.76 374.29 B: you know however that worked and i am very conscious of i'm almost fanatical and knock the head off i will not throw the butt on the ground 

374.43 376.53 B: [sigh] um yeah that's wrong 

374.73 375.65 A: oh really 

376.59 377.94 A: yeah 

377.10 387.47 B: [sigh] and um [sigh] [lipsmack] but you know it you sometimes you just gotta [laughter] especially if you're you're drinking you're out and you're social you're [sigh] 

386.88 388.12 A: right 

387.55 388.45 B: um 

388.53 390.33 B: but there ought to be equal 

391.99 394.81 B: you can go here you can go there and not just the flat 

394.41 395.38 A: (( right )) 

394.85 396.76 B: you can't do it anywhere [sigh] 

397.24 399.95 A: right [lipsmack] i almost kind of think that 

397.92 398.91 B: (( but [mn] [sigh] )) 

400.63 401.79 A: [cough] maybe 

402.01 407.18 A: well i don't know if it would really make sense i'm trying to think i was thinking about you know if you make like certain 

407.97 408.72 A: uh 

408.70 415.04 A: stipulations where you said okay here we that this restaurant i- restaurant or the bar can decide if they're allowed or not 

414.97 425.94 A: and then they just realise okay if you don't like smoke then don't go there but then that's going to create a problem because then you're going to have restaurants who are going to cater to either one or the other and then [sigh] that might cause 

425.96 433.07 B: right but that also would work on supply and demand right [sigh] if you're a smoking restaurant and people don't go 

433.76 436.18 B: then wait a minute [laughter] 

436.24 438.79 B: real quick they're going to go to non-smoking 

436.70 438.35 A: yeah 

438.86 440.83 A: yeah 

440.79 442.60 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] so it's really hard to say 

443.20 443.85 A: (( mm )) 

443.36 447.36 B: but um but you're very right about the gossip that's very bad 

447.84 450.37 A: yeah [sigh] that was that's what i was thinking 

450.63 453.22 A: just i just you know spur of the moment like 

453.49 454.67 B: and uh 

454.30 455.22 A: (( not uh )) 

454.88 457.08 B: not exercising is pretty bad too 

457.51 459.46 A: yeah 

458.89 462.20 B: [sigh] but as a grad student do you have time for that 

462.21 463.33 A: exercise 

462.96 463.76 B: yeah 

463.61 472.18 A: i do but not as much as i like when i was an i was an undergrad um i i was able to work out six days a week and i loved it um 

472.96 486.05 A: and i loved it 'cause you you know you feel great [sigh] you uh i wake up in the i w- i would wake up in the morning you know like five thirty or six and i felt wide awake [sigh] and then you know when i got sick i was only sick 

485.87 494.54 A: instead of sick being sick for a a week or two weeks i was sick for like two days or something and i got better it wasn't as bad but now i guess grad school um 

494.89 498.95 A: last semester i got in for three days a week but it was only for like twenty minutes 

499.17 500.20 B: mhm 

499.59 505.51 A: um but on the other hand part of it is i don't overindulge um 

505.99 507.62 A: and i don't uh 

508.55 510.44 A: uh i have a high metabolism 

510.29 512.41 B: [mn] oh well you're lucky that way then 

510.80 512.05 A: (( so um )) 

512.39 517.77 A: yeah yeah [sigh] but i also like i don't have you know i i don't have tons of junk food or 

518.20 526.27 A: candies it's not kinda like i overindulge i'm really kind of on the opposite i'm kind of starving [sigh] i uh live on rama noodles and macaroni and cheese 

525.41 527.37 B: [laughter] is that really true 

527.49 529.45 B: that college kids do that 

527.88 528.78 A: um 

529.38 534.05 A: for for me for me it is just because um 

534.23 536.63 A: i i have a graduate assistantship 

536.30 538.17 B: mhm 

537.32 538.65 A: and uh [sigh] 

539.07 545.30 A: uh i don't have a student loan i really don't want a student loan um just because i'd rather get time just to be able to get into the work 

545.65 555.51 A: field and [sigh] um without paying things off and having that over me i plan on getting married next summer and i don't want to [sigh] you know have that to worry about too [sigh] and because of that [cough]

561.80 564.17 B: no way [sigh] [sigh] 

561.99 567.03 A: which yeah which is tough when you consider the fact that um 

567.14 570.47 A: you know i've got rent which is i have dirt cheap rent 

570.44 582.29 A: i'm living in a laundry room and i'm paying a hundred and fifty bucks a month so already i'm fifty bucks short [sigh] i've also got gas also i got you know food and i have to work on saturdays like doing yard work and stuff
