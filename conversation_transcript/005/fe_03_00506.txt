235.09 237.78 A: yeah uh or somebody gets 

236.67 242.93 B: you try to get rid of it but it goes to the next person and then the next person and then it might even come back to you [laughter] so 

240.46 241.26 A: yeah 

242.39 255.58 A: but they say when you get sick uh you're uh you're uh y- y- uh you're spreading germs like he went to the hospital and got a flu shot and then two days later he was sick and coughing 

251.38 251.96 B: (( mm )) 

256.10 262.80 A: and they said the flu shot could've ge- got him sick well what somebody at the hospital got him sick [laughter] 

261.77 263.18 B: probably 

262.82 264.09 A: yeah so 

264.03 269.90 B: because like the when you get like flu shots and stuff that's supposed to take like it takes a while for it to affect you

271.21 282.06 A: well he did uh uh he uh but he's got asthma himself so the doctor said you know with him it could be his asthma acting up or it could be you know something else 

282.11 283.17 B: mhm 

282.52 291.37 A: so they oh you know so when he's coughing and doesn't feel good you don't know if it's causing his asthma or did he catch an infection or something 

290.98 292.34 B: exactly 

292.08 292.79 A: (( uh )) 

292.85 297.68 A: but like uh him he doesn't supposed to take stuff over the counter 

297.85 308.94 A: uh because he's a diabetic and he gets stuff from the uh doctor but then the doctor he- he'll say oh well you could go and buy some uh actifed it's like sudafed it's okay you take that 

308.89 309.89 B: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

309.62 318.63 A: so he um he said well i thought i don't supposed to take it with my asthma medicine oh no it's okay you take it once in a well or tylenol colds you know 

318.57 319.59 B: yeah 

319.45 322.41 A: (( so you know it's okay you take this mhm ))

370.85 383.45 B: central florida which is like seventy degrees during the day and stuff and over here it's sometimes forties to thirties right now in the winter which if you're not used to it you can get sick easier i guess because of how cold it is and especially like 

377.25 378.12 A: (( geez )) 

380.38 381.25 A: yeah 

383.82 394.95 B: now like everybody i know is getting sick just 'cause they're going from one class to the next and one's hot and one's cold you know and people next to 'em are sick you catch their cold and stuff especially like 

393.90 394.69 A: (( i went )) 

395.03 403.86 A: i went to florida to orlando uh a while back and i've been there quite a few times and it's hot in the summertime it's like a muggy heat 

403.97 405.82 B: yeah that's orlando 

405.55 406.47 A: (( uh-huh )) 

405.92 414.10 B: but it's like that in all florida it's always muggy and you can get sick from the mugginess too i guess just 'cause it's some people get like sunstroke and stuff like that 

410.82 411.69 A: uh-huh 

413.88 423.49 A: oh yeah i when we went through uh uh disney world i seen people like who were collapsing [mn] uh like they look like they were going to collapse from the heat 'cause 

417.63 418.79 B: mhm 

422.87 427.80 B: yeah my sister collapsed in the heat at disney actually [laughter] so um 

425.88 426.99 A: [laughter] 

427.86 432.72 B: yeah it it can happen and like we're from florida and always used to the heat 

432.03 440.10 A: yeah uh not me uh i'm used to like i live in concord california which is not too far from san francisco 

440.06 452.53 A: but i'm used to cool foggy weather and like in the sixties and in the summertime it gets like in the eighties and nineties there i'm not used to eighty eighty ninety degree weather 

452.94 458.75 A: and like today it was only in the forties and it was cool so but the but it 

458.01 459.83 B: the rain must get like 

460.10 470.06 B: annoying when like it's cold out and like i think that's when my nose starts to act up the most [laughter] i start like sniffling is when it's like rainy out and cold 

465.87 466.74 A: uh-huh 

468.62 469.45 A: uh-huh 

470.48 472.86 B: because i think the rain gets to you more 

470.64 471.52 A: yeah 

472.56 487.09 A: claritin over the counter is good to try they they've now got it over the counter [mn] uh-huh claritin uh uh they have it here in california over the counter claritin i guess they have it state wide uh you 

478.02 478.99 B: really 

486.35 491.12 B: i don't know if they have it here i'm not sure 'cause i don't i don't have any allergies so 

490.77 496.07 A: (( oh yes the the claritin well the claritin it's good for even like the sudafed )) 

495.99 497.58 B: mhm 

496.14 502.00 A: it's good for like when you're nose is running or you're stuffy or if your eyes are watery 

502.01 508.87 A: or you get pressure in your head or nose or or runny nose the like the the claritin 

508.87 517.86 A: or the actifed or sudafed which is the non-drowsy kind uh they help with stuff like that and 

513.57 514.79 B: mhm 

516.98 518.10 B: that's cool 

518.05 526.79 A: the sudafed is good to take for uh ru- like runny noses the reason why uh i take sudafed 'cause the actifed makes you drowsy 

527.00 532.23 B: yeah and sudafed acts differently on me it makes me drowsy i don't know why even the non-drowsy one 

527.07 528.00 A: and 

531.59 533.72 A: [laughter] 

532.82 547.15 B: yeah like i take tylenol sinus and like that'll be fine but i guess i have opposite reactions on some of 'em because like if i drink mountain dew that won't keep me up at night you know because of the caffeine and that but it doesn't affect me so it's weird 

545.25 545.82 A: (( mm )) 

546.17 557.55 A: uh-huh yeah uh but m- medicines are like that the most i take if they say they'll make you drowsy they'll make me drowsy and and uh 

555.81 557.40 B: mhm 

557.65 565.14 A: uh uh my husband can take actifed and it doesn't phase him one bit and and me it'll make me sleepy 

562.54 563.51 B: really 

565.56 571.05 A: i one time took actifed during the day and i was [sigh] oh tired the whole day 

565.83 566.54 B: mm 

571.10 573.63 A: so i i switched over to sudafed 

574.15 583.97 A: but claritin seems better but since claritin is a paid prescription i i don't need it every day i use it when when i need it you know 

583.58 584.70 B: yeah 

583.99 586.61 A: so claritin lasts me twenty four hours 

586.88 587.99 A: so what i do 

587.12 591.06 B: well that's good make you feel better longer [laughter] 

588.23 589.55 A: but what i do 

590.18 599.89 A: uh-huh yeah if i feel like i'm catching a cold or if my nose is bothering me uh running and then i'll take the claritin then it usually helps
