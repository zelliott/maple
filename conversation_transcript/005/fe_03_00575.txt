23.50 24.53 B: and i guess if you call 

24.67 28.11 B: would count star search that is about it 

26.36 32.72 A: yeah i guess that is kind of reality isn't it yeah i was thinking of like um 

30.29 31.26 B: yeah a little bit 

33.10 36.30 A: there was one on for awhile named called temptation island 

36.77 39.95 B: uh yeah i heard of that we we didn't really watch it though i've got 

40.29 43.11 B: uh a teenage daughter so we try to you know 

43.33 46.05 B: there there is an awful lot of sex and stuff on those shows 

46.34 46.84 A: yeah 

47.09 50.59 A: there was i wat- i watched a few of them and i 

50.10 50.53 B: yeah

56.35 56.90 B: yeah 

57.17 58.54 A: yeah who wants to 

57.74 61.05 B: now we do plan on watching the last episode of the the 

61.17 61.94 B: one where there's 

62.10 63.28 B: faking out all the girls 

63.88 66.76 B: uh who wants to marry a millionaire or something like that 

64.02 64.57 A: yeah 

66.58 68.87 A: yeah the one that is on now that is not really a 

67.81 68.19 B: yeah 

68.79 72.87 B: yeah that he is not really right we're going to watch the last one of those just -cause we want to see 

69.16 70.04 A: millionaire 

73.11 75.69 B: all the girls freak out when they find out 

75.24 79.66 A: yeah i know i don't know how they can even do that to people 

78.02 85.58 B: i don't know but i think it's kind of justice they are all out there gold-digging and looking for somebody for his wallet and they are fixing to get tips for a ride i think that is kind of 

82.01 82.27 A: (( )) 

84.65 86.48 A: yeah that is true that is 

85.89 87.40 B: i think that is kind of justice 

88.41 88.89 A: yeah 

89.32 90.68 A: yeah you got a point 

91.61 95.45 A: it is kind of justice because i mean that is what they are there for is the money 

95.37 96.78 B: yeah exactly you know 

97.05 103.90 B: and once they get there i'm wondering once they get there if she is really going to hang around once she finds out what he really makes 

102.12 106.66 A: i know but the fact that you got lied to in the first place might 

106.34 110.50 B: oh yeah yeah i'd be highly upset if i were one of them 

109.35 110.94 A: i would too i mean 

111.10 115.20 A: if he is not going to be rich let me know you know and maybe i would still like him but you know 

113.39 114.49 B: yeah 

115.78 116.34 B: -cause i mean 

115.84 118.21 A: don't tell me yes when he is not 

118.06 118.44 B: yeah 

118.67 123.93 B: yeah they've got one coming out that i saw on t._v. that uh america chooses the bride or something like that 

124.19 127.13 A: oh i've seen some- yeah that looked like it might be good 

125.50 126.51 B: yeah 

127.27 134.40 B: yeah it might be good but per- i couldn't personally see myself going on a show or anyone i know going on a show and then having america pick for you 

134.62 135.54 A: i know 

134.64 142.04 B: i mean um there must yeah there's got to be some money involved in that one i mean who would do that in their right mind 

136.21 137.47 A: i think they are crazy 

142.14 144.47 A: uh either that or they are desperate 

143.77 148.79 B: uh that is a possibility too i've got a few single friends that are just about that desperate 

148.80 152.00 A: just about ready to go on something like that i would hate that 

151.95 153.27 B: oh yeah 

152.82 153.15 A: yeah 

153.34 157.85 A: yeah i got a twenty one year old daughter and she even thinks that one i s stupid you know 

158.86 159.31 A: i mean 

159.75 163.66 A: you going to let the world pick for you they don't have to live with them you know 

163.20 164.18 B: really 

163.86 164.93 A: i think they are crazy 

165.82 167.72 A: i'd never do anything like that 

167.48 168.48 B: no me neither 

168.49 170.53 A: can i ask where you live 

170.28 171.16 B: uh in oklahoma

173.43 174.57 A: washington state 

174.51 181.71 B: oh really well that's that's where my single friend is from or he actually he is living there he is from here i went to school with him in high school 

175.25 175.63 A: yeah 

177.17 178.19 A: oh really 

183.40 183.95 A: yeah i've 

184.16 185.96 A: lived here all my life 

186.60 188.14 A: my home 

188.44 191.99 A: and yeah i don't really get into those 

193.18 196.74 A: survivor type shows i watched it a couple of times and 

196.25 203.96 B: the first one was pretty good but after after that i think it was kind of hard to watch with the gay guy parading around nude and all that but 

203.39 206.31 A: (( )) 

204.64 207.04 B: after that it just really turned in to more of a 

207.68 211.81 B: a sex party or so although now this one though that they've got on there now is 

212.06 216.53 B: supposed to be men verses women and that one might be a little cleaner we hadn't really checked that one out though 

216.95 220.36 A: well i know that is what it seems like they are selling on these shows anyway you know 

219.57 227.48 B: pretty much pretty much yeah and like i said i've got well we've got the older one and we've got two that are small children and i really don't want them watching it so 

234.62 237.94 A: sometimes i do like surveys and polls on the internet and stuff 

237.66 243.79 B: oh yeah oh yeah i do all kinds of stuff like that i'm a stay at home mom so i try to make 

242.34 242.88 A: yeah 

243.05 243.35 A: i've 

243.51 243.86 A: that is 

243.89 245.20 B: make money where i can 

245.29 247.98 A: how i spend the biggest amount of my time is on the internet 

248.04 251.58 B: eh yeah i do mine after the kids go to bed at night 

248.93 250.41 A: you know and doing surveys 

251.85 256.53 A: but i unlike some of them you get to tell them what you think of the t._v. shows you know or the commercials or 

255.34 255.93 B: yeah 

256.94 259.35 B: yeah there is one called reality t._v. that i i've 

259.46 262.36 B: checked out for a little while i hadn't really kept up with it a whole lot (( that you )) 

262.84 263.27 B: you take 

263.48 268.83 B: questionnaires on t._v. shows that you've watched that evening and there's chances to win you know prizes and stuff 

267.91 270.94 A: oh yeah i think i just signed up for that one recently 

270.53 270.94 B: yeah 

271.16 273.98 B: i i've accumulated a few points but i i've never gone you know 

274.92 275.98 B: and done anything yet 

276.09 277.09 B: so with -em 

278.40 281.19 A: yeah i would like to do that you know so i could give my 

281.34 283.02 A: -cause i was even trying to 

283.26 286.05 A: write to t._v. stations and stuff and telling them 

286.40 288.19 A: all this smut and 

287.72 289.37 B: yeah yeah it it just 

288.84 290.47 A: it gets tiresome 

289.49 294.82 B: they don't listen there's they figure that if they can get enough of the younger crowds in to watch everything that you know 

295.20 297.24 B: they can blow the rest of us off 

297.51 298.03 A: yup 

299.09 299.98 A: i just 

300.72 302.38 A: i'm not impressed 

301.73 306.24 B: no i'm not either like i said we really don't watch a whole lot of reality t._v. shows to 

306.66 307.40 B: i like the 

307.96 310.25 B: the ones where they have a chance to you know like the 

310.54 311.75 B: american idol that one was 

311.87 313.00 B: that was pretty good 

312.27 312.72 A: yeah 

313.10 314.99 A: who did you want to win 

314.45 318.90 B: i thought justin did a better job he was a better showman than she was they both had wonderful voices 

317.37 318.49 A: yeah 

319.24 324.18 B: but he was a much better showman but you know you've got the teeny boppers who are the ones who are doing the voting so 

319.41 319.76 A: yes 

324.43 324.84 B: you know 

325.14 326.98 A: you know well i didn't know until after it was 

327.08 331.17 A: pretty much over that you could vote like you know hundreds of times if you wanted 

330.82 332.85 B: yeah so you could get (( )) 

332.66 334.72 A: yeah well i don't think that was fair 

335.00 335.66 B: no 

335.18 336.14 A: you know 

336.34 338.74 A: -cause what about the people who didn't know that 

338.44 339.95 B: yeah really 

343.33 345.00 A: when i was doing to too so 

345.03 345.38 B: yeah 

346.07 347.08 B: yeah i've that is it 

346.26 346.52 A: they 

346.64 349.21 A: -cause they they were looking for the american idol 

349.56 350.38 B: yeah that is i've 

349.91 350.88 A: you know and that 

351.33 353.84 A: isn't just somebody who can sing you know 

353.34 353.78 B: yeah 

353.97 358.63 B: someone who puts on a show and he puts on a show he is a performer you know there is a difference 

355.51 355.92 A: yeah 

357.43 357.82 A: yup 

358.91 363.70 A: and it looks like they both got pretty famous anyway they both got music you know coming out and 

362.82 365.96 B: oh yeah yeah and i think they are doing a movie together too i've i've heard 

365.71 366.14 A: yeah

374.41 377.44 A: i didn't watch it all the way through the first one but 

377.83 380.81 A: after i got interested in the end of it towards the end of it 

380.10 380.48 B: yeah 

381.10 385.19 B: yeah we didn't watch the first few episodes of it either we came in when they were down to about ten people 

385.73 386.69 A: yeah me too 

386.00 386.51 B: and 

386.67 388.85 B: and watched it from there 

387.75 390.53 A: that is when it really started getting interesting i think 

390.26 390.89 B: yeah 

391.26 393.11 A: but i've been watching this one 

392.88 395.88 B: yeah me too the try-outs are a riot 

396.01 396.81 B: they are hilarious 

396.35 397.26 A: oh i know 

397.50 399.68 A: how do they even get on there 

399.17 405.20 B: i don't know do they not hear themselves it m- makes you wonder can you really not hear how bad you are i mean 

404.12 404.39 A: (( )) 

405.76 409.01 A: well the thing is they've been heard to make it that far 

409.43 410.99 A: uh from what i understand 

410.15 414.56 B: yeah that is what yeah me too i didn't i didn't who passed these people on 

412.73 413.06 A: so 

413.63 414.42 A: yes 

414.55 417.15 A: how did they even make it 

416.61 420.49 B: it was really what have they got beethoven doing the judging or what 

419.59 427.44 A: yeah really hm i mean i can't sing and i know it you know i would never embarrass myself 

425.26 425.85 B: yeah huh 

427.22 427.65 B: yeah 

427.95 430.30 A: some of -em are just terrible i don't know 

428.04 428.61 B: yeah that's 

430.37 434.80 B: yeah that is one thing i find kind of unfair about it they don't let anybody over twenty five 

435.29 435.97 B: try out 

436.50 437.00 A: yeah 

436.86 442.92 B: and i mean that that doesn't that make it sound like you know that there are not older people out there making lots of money singing um you know 

443.27 445.36 A: yeah well i guess if they are over 

443.54 450.41 B: you get tina turner and you know mick jagger is out there still making money but these people can't try out if they are over twenty five 

450.78 452.95 B: you know i kind of thought that is a little off but 

451.34 451.90 A: yeah 

453.65 455.31 B: i guess they have to make the rules 

453.77 455.25 A: i recently won tickets 

455.39 456.68 A: to the rolling stones 

456.88 457.57 B: oh really 

457.73 458.74 A: but it is in

461.11 462.80 B: oh no 

461.98 465.40 A: and they won't let me sell or give the tickets away or anything 

465.23 467.62 B: oh no what a waste 

466.64 467.57 A: i know 

467.95 469.89 A: so i told -em i couldn't go 

469.81 470.48 B: yup 

470.03 472.16 A: so they can maybe give them to someone else you know 

472.40 473.77 B: yeah 

473.45 473.82 A: uh 

474.00 479.16 A: one thing oh and you know i haven't i've been to one concert in my life and it wasn't even a popular one

492.81 493.24 B: yeah 

493.93 495.49 A: yeah that would be cool 

495.14 497.95 B: other than that uh the only other really famous people i've 

498.06 501.29 B: saw in concert was bon jovi and that was back in like eighty five 

501.90 502.82 B: and that is it 

502.98 507.52 B: so yeah to get to go to a stones concert would have been just really cool 

506.30 507.01 A: yeah 

507.13 513.48 A: you know i know uh i couldn't believe it well i signed other people up to win it too and i thought maybe they would win 

513.59 520.68 A: you know i didn't think about that i might win i never really considered it -cause i knew it was down in uh los angeles you know 

514.19 514.61 B: yeah 

520.24 520.67 B: yeah 

521.21 528.24 A: and then i won and then i thought oh my god how am i going to get there can i get there i don't think so i would like to try it but
