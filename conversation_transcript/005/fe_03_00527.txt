31.28 33.80 B: ruin people's [sigh] um 

34.16 43.50 B: you know their reputations um sometimes the gossip ruins people's lives because it it interferes with them personally an- and certainly can interfere with them professionally 

44.13 46.58 A: oh yeah that's really true an- and w- 

46.64 53.94 A: i i think what's really bad about gossiping [sigh] is so often it gets repeated and it gets repeated inaccurately [laughter] 

53.38 65.32 B: absolutely [sigh] you know you tell tell something and down the line it it makes it through fifteen people and it's now turned into a [sigh] a two hour story instead of a two second statement [laughter] 

63.88 67.21 A: [laughter] really [sigh] like that telephone game 

66.97 68.24 B: (( [sigh] yes ))

94.12 95.17 B: oh okay 

95.26 100.85 B: okay well let's see we had gossiping um i don't see caffeine addiction as a 

95.71 96.88 A: and so 

101.28 103.97 B: major plague in society [noise] 

103.11 105.26 A: [sigh] no not really 

104.15 109.23 B: [laughter] it's more of a a personal choice than i think it is a [noise] 

109.14 112.66 A: [sigh] yeah it can sure cause medical problems for people 

109.56 110.92 B: an affliction 

113.49 114.32 B: true 

113.56 122.52 A: well some people are are so sensitive to caffeine you know they end up getting hyper and and uh rubbing the people the wrong way [laughter] 

120.57 121.13 B: (( [noise] )) 

121.86 126.79 B: that's true [sigh] i mean they did mention alcohol and i think that that's more of a 

126.60 139.94 B: a potential hazard it [mn] you know if it's moderate and and handled in a responsible setting then that's one thing but [sigh] um you know you put teenagers and alcohol i volunteer in a rescue squad and [sigh] and we see too many of the 

139.82 141.98 B: alcohol involved accidents 

143.06 144.27 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

143.06 149.31 B: [sigh] and you know you get the domestic situations and things like that and that's just kind of a bad combination 

149.32 153.15 A: [sigh] we have lots of problems with alcohol in our area 

153.27 155.18 A: [sigh] i live in las vegas 

154.74 158.78 B: oh okay i live in new jersey but i'll tell ya i love vegas 

155.60 156.55 A: yeah 

158.68 169.83 A: oh do you [laughter] [sigh] it's it's a fun place to visit [sigh] uh b- but the the problem being especially with uh the casinos giving out free drinks all the time 

159.13 160.57 B: [laughter] 

160.60 161.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

169.54 170.29 B: yes 

169.94 172.05 A: [sigh] and people get angry 

172.60 180.45 A: and people get you know if they've been drinking they get [mn] even more angry and more hostile from losing 

180.36 184.17 B: [mn] that's right and they lose their tolerance for for the other people 

183.81 191.77 A: mhm [sigh] and then they leave the casino and they've been drinking and they're angry and they drive like crazy 

192.03 194.34 A: it's just unbelievable 

194.57 199.86 A: uh [mn] we see people walking out of the casino they can't even walk straight you know 

198.54 200.86 B: i i know exactly what you mean [noise] 

200.36 209.30 A: mm then they get in the car and th- i mean they're muttering all the way out the door because they're mad [sigh] and you know and you watch them burn rubber out the parking lot 

209.91 213.71 A: and you wonder what's going to happen to the rest of their family when they get home [sigh] 

213.15 215.35 B: yes that's true that's true 

215.08 216.82 A: if they make it home [laughter] 

216.34 218.98 B: that- that's the problem and like a 

218.01 221.70 A: like we have just a terrible accident rate here 

221.96 222.90 B: really 

222.88 228.58 A: oh yeah from [sigh] well you know the majority of the people that live here gamble 

229.19 236.37 A: and you know every five minutes a cocktail waitress is going by saying you know cocktails cocktails [laughter] and they're free 

235.02 235.86 B: yes 

236.06 243.27 B: yes i know when when we've been there we've seen some of the people that that should have been removed long ago 

237.29 239.53 A: so they pay a lot of people 

243.29 247.11 A: [sigh] well a lot of people that wouldn't normally drink or drink that much 

247.62 250.60 A: end up drinking more than they would 

251.07 253.29 A: for one reason because it's free 

253.62 256.45 A: and another because they're frustrated [sigh] 

257.02 257.81 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

258.82 272.41 B: uh i know exactly what you mean you know like i say we've visited there quite frequently and [sigh] and you see it constantly just watching [sigh] um especially the younger crowd i think because it's like you know they don't have to spend eight dollars on a drink at a 

272.25 284.85 B: at a bar they're they're free and of course the casino's out to make the buck and [sigh] if you're drinking you're hopefully not going to notice you're losing as much or [sigh] be stupid with what you bet and you know they're going to make money 

273.97 275.23 A: right 

283.15 284.67 A: exactly 

284.87 298.99 B: especially i know you know like i play blackjack so you sit at a table and if you've got [sigh] someone that's that's three sheets they have no clue what they're betting for or against or what they're doing and you know of course the house is going to continue to win 

285.16 286.03 A: yeah 

298.76 305.93 A: oh i know you ought to see some of the silly things we see people do [sigh] when it comes to playing like the video poker machine 

306.11 314.01 A: [sigh] you know th- they make really crazy plays [sigh] and you know part of it is the fact that they're so drunk that they [laughter] don't know what they're doing 

308.71 309.79 B: yeah 

313.89 315.11 B: [laughter] 

314.46 318.35 A: [laughter] which brings up another personal habit of of smoking [laughter] 

318.30 319.19 B: oh 

319.18 320.62 A: which ah 

320.77 323.33 A: [mn] so many of the people in the casino do 

323.96 331.97 A: [sigh] and they just sit there and chain smoke one cigarette after another [laughter] you know it's [mn] drag on the cigarette you know sip on the drink [laughter] 

331.05 332.01 B: right 

332.03 334.12 B: yeah they kind of go hand in hand 

333.55 334.64 A: they do 

335.93 345.65 A: and i think a larger percentage of people that smoke well i know i've i've heard from statistics that we've got more smokers here in nevada than most other states 

345.78 346.79 B: really 

346.42 348.23 A: it's a personality type [mn] 

348.75 355.53 A: you know the type that that goes for the gambling uh is a risk taker you know and that's what smokers are too 

355.50 359.13 B: right and it's kind of one addiction hand in hand with another 

358.57 362.49 A: uh-huh yeah and then the alcohol fits right in [laughter] as well 

362.38 368.09 B: and then you get and then you tie that right into the gossiping because it ties right into the story telling [laughter] 

367.39 368.73 A: yeah 

368.31 370.52 B: kind of all goes hand in hand 

371.48 377.42 B: yeah i'd- i i mean i you know they they gave us that list and i mean you can go down several of them and and 

377.44 387.38 B: even hit on the you know obis- obesity topic and i mean there is there's people that can't help the problem and then there's people that can help the problem and um you know i just 

387.48 393.06 B: i i don't know if you saw on the news that they had the the girl suing mcdonalds 

394.20 395.50 A: [sigh] another one 

395.27 401.10 B: it's the teenage girl she's eighteen or nineteen suing mcdonalds because they made her obese 

401.28 404.30 A: [sigh] oh i heard something about that 

402.87 403.87 B: yes 

403.89 407.98 B: and i mean she she was eating phenomenal amounts of food daily 

408.02 419.19 B: there you know [sigh] um the average person would have say you know a meal of the chicken fingers and she would go there for for lunch and order three plus you know two big macs and 

419.01 432.07 B: and you know a whole bunch of french fries and onion rings and then you know a couple of shakes and [sigh] that was her normal lunch and she did this daily and you know there was no warning that she might get obese from it so she's suing mcdonalds 

432.08 434.10 A: oh that's so crazy [sigh] 

434.13 443.50 B: and you know i mean and and that's where you know the obesity comes into the problem and society is is from that kind of a a setting 

443.60 445.84 B: you know i mean it's one thing if if 

446.11 455.88 B: circumstances has have caused it you know beyond your control but if you can change it i think there's too many options out there today for you not to change 

458.62 459.74 B: (( [lipsmack] but )) 

458.97 470.71 A: okay i know overeating and obesity are [laughter] also and not and lack of exercise [sigh] which is another thing that's was also listed on this question [sigh] those are all things that uh are are major problems here too

489.43 496.67 A: oh yeah and you [mn] all you got to do is play the machines with your club card in you know and you get points and they'll give you free [laughter] buffets for 'em

496.59 510.69 B: yep i know when we're out there we you know [sigh] we usually use the comp towards our our room but um you know because the buffets are so cheap but still i mean you you decide okay well i've been gambling all night so i'll eat breakfast at four o'clock and go to bed 

510.96 512.27 A: mhm 

511.50 516.11 B: and of course what do you do you eat and you sleep for a few hours right after you eat 

516.75 519.69 B: which is you know one of the worst things that you can do 

520.05 533.46 A: yeah buffets th- and people have a tendency to overeat because you know it's there it's free you've paid for it basically you know took free to get more [laughter] you know [laughter] more and more [sigh] and you think well i want i want to eat my money's worth you know [laughter] so
