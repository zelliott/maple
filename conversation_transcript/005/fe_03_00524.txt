19.27 20.54 B: yeah yeah oh

32.17 33.25 A: yeah 

34.14 38.56 B: you know i think that's a habit that's a little harder to break because it's an addiction 

38.09 39.41 A: exactly 

38.79 41.19 B: (( as is drinking and you know )) 

40.12 44.30 A: i don't know i know a few people who gossiping could be classified as an addiction [laughter]

45.13 47.27 A: [laughter] 

46.85 50.23 B: i come from a long line of proud gossipers so 

49.39 51.04 A: [laughter] 

50.37 58.40 B: you know it it was actually a a habit that i had to look at and and try to break so [sigh] but oh

68.44 77.15 A: i i stay at home with my kids and and i babysit a girlfriend of mine's kids and pretty much she sounds off at me whatever happens throughout her day so [laughter]

77.30 78.45 B: right 

79.15 86.88 B: right and so tell me who would you repeat [noise] oh budgie sorry i just stepped on the cat [laughter] oh god [laughter]

89.65 91.93 B: right right 

92.70 97.56 B: oh and you know um i'm part of a twelve step programme and we had to do a 

98.09 101.60 B: moral inventory of ourselves for the fourth step 

99.80 100.72 A: right 

101.58 114.82 B: and you know gossip was one of the main things that i put down that i wanted to change about myself and [sigh] course i don't smoke and i don't drink and [sigh] so i exercise so i can't remember what else [laughter] he said [laughter] 

106.13 107.21 A: right 

114.25 119.98 A: i think uh smoking drinking not exercising and drinking a lot of caffeine 

119.37 121.01 B: (( right ok- )) 

120.47 122.46 A: [mn] if i don't have the caffeine 

122.60 130.65 A: i have a really bad withdrawal headache so i can't do without my tea not a soda can't handle the soda bad on my stomach but tea 

126.34 127.44 B: right 

130.70 139.39 A: if i don't have my tea during the day i get really bad headaches [laughter] so [laughter] smoking i quit doing that a long time ago whe- when i was pregnant the first time so 

133.82 134.85 B: right 

138.82 140.47 B: oh well that's good 

139.76 140.66 A: [laughter] 

140.54 142.50 B: [mn] well i mean in that case 

142.52 153.11 B: you know if someone was pregnant and smoking or or drinking then definitely it would be a habit that that would be harmful to someone else other than themselves 

145.25 146.89 A: [noise] oh then i'd yeah 

148.42 150.86 A: oh absolutely absolutely 

152.25 154.11 A: mhm that's true

156.23 157.96 A: i'm in south alabama 

157.69 165.97 B: oh okay well i'm in kentucky so they didn't exactly get divergent viewpoints [laughter] and i grew up in florida so 

162.39 164.56 A: not too much no but 

165.45 169.49 A: mhm i'm i'm righ- i'm actually on the florida alabama line 

166.25 167.14 B: but 

169.36 171.09 B: oh okay okay 

170.30 181.64 A: pretty much where i mean i'm closer to florida than i m- i'm in alabama but i i stay in pensacola most of the time so [laughter] that's where everything is 'cause all there is out here where i am is cows so [laughter] 

175.84 176.98 B: (( oh okay )) 

177.19 178.27 B: okay 

181.01 183.35 B: okay cows 

181.98 186.84 A: but uh my husband's i like being where there's more cows than people it's just nicer that way [laughter] 

186.41 189.26 B: i understand i grew up in orlando and i live in a 

189.35 191.92 B: not too large town now but 

191.20 192.17 A: really 

191.94 193.22 B: yeah 

192.60 195.56 A: the only place i think i've been in kentucky is paducah 

195.52 198.18 B: oh well i'm about an hour from there 

196.36 199.35 A: i had an aunt yeah i had an aunt up there 

199.82 202.09 B: yeah i'm in hopkinsville 

202.09 203.82 A: (( [mn] mm no [sigh] [noise] )) 

202.45 206.69 B: which if you have gone to paducah from alabama then you've probably 

206.99 208.41 B: passed right by 

208.10 210.52 A: probably probably it's been ages 

210.87 212.36 B: oh i hear babies 

211.33 214.18 A: [noise] [noise] yes [noise] and scooby doo 

213.94 216.13 B: (( [laughter] scooby doo [laughter] )) 

214.44 219.16 A: [laughter] i have two toddlers and my eight year old daughter's home from school her tonsils flared 

219.00 220.54 B: oh jeeze 

219.92 220.83 A: (( so i don't )) 

221.15 225.11 B: well how long have we been talking do you [laughter] think 

223.95 228.84 A: know i think the robot comes on after ten minutes is the w- what i remember but um m- 

226.08 227.39 B: right 

227.77 228.87 B: well do we [laughter] 

229.89 243.30 A: back i'm back on topic if i can [noise] get on that way i had a girlfriend whose doctor told her she smoked over a pack a day and he told her as long as she cut back to ten cigarettes a day while she was pregnant she'd be fine i thought that was appalling 

234.12 235.20 B: mhm 

237.09 238.11 B: mhm 

243.16 246.14 B: yeah that's pretty insane 

243.85 252.36 A: [noise] i thought that was ridiculous [laughter] he said the shock to her body of quitting cold cu- cold turkey would be worse to the baby than just cutting back 

253.28 257.25 A: which i didn't see that at all [laughter] 

254.45 262.40 B: i don't see that no you know i mean it seems like most of the people that do quit smoking 

262.95 267.44 B: quit cold turkey if they're successful at it and yeah 

264.22 266.20 A: [noise] right if that's the only way 

266.71 276.20 A: i was lucky that my my body chemistry [noise] changed pretty much to the point the minute that i was pregnant i didn't know i was pregnant when i quit i found out about a month later 

274.31 275.26 B: mhm 

276.11 277.44 B: oh okay 

276.39 282.60 A: so but i it just got to you know how your tastes change for food and drink when you're pregnant 

282.05 283.07 B: right 

282.69 286.79 A: same thing happened when i got pregnant with cigarettes they made me physically ill 

286.83 291.08 A: the next time i tried to smoke it just literally disgusting 

288.61 289.51 B: (( oh well )) 

291.02 302.36 B: definitely to your advantage right kinda like you know i worked for the court system for years and back when i first started they were giving antabuse to to people hoping that 

291.36 293.75 A: so [laughter] yes 

293.96 294.57 A: (( oh )) 

302.00 303.34 A: (( [noise] right )) 

302.37 305.86 B: if if they became violently ill when they drank 

305.26 306.17 A: right 

305.75 317.78 B: they would not drink of course aversion therapy doesn't really work on alcoholics so [laughter] you know [sigh] um because they're used to being ill from the effects of drinking so 

306.89 307.99 A: right 

311.00 312.09 A: right 

316.51 318.32 A: (( [noise] exactly )) 

318.08 320.38 B: but yeah i would think that if you 

320.46 324.56 B: if it tasted horrible when you smoked because i would think that 

324.98 329.08 B: taste would be the majority of it wouldn't it 

327.76 340.91 A: yeah i i i i didn't enjoy being [laughter] physically ill from something that it it was a casual thing to start with just you know at work and and and out not generally at home and not you know every [sigh] 

334.98 336.10 B: right 

340.73 354.03 A: so often i mean you know to the point where i was throwing cigarette packs out i kept them in my silverware drawer and throw 'em out after a while but yeah we- well it it wasn't a really big thing i told my husband i don't really have an addictive nature i don't think but 

346.88 348.73 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

353.45 354.90 B: right 

354.11 358.05 A: but that it was easy for me to drop once that i'd got just ill 

358.25 361.75 A: just completely ill i mean we used to pick up a young man 

362.26 366.88 A: uh that worked with my husband and take him to work in the morning and 

363.71 364.77 B: mhm 

367.01 373.49 A: he wouldn't be smoking in the car but just him getting in the car with it on his clothes made me just sick 

373.18 374.83 B: oh that's odd yeah 

373.84 376.94 A: sick [laughter] to my stomach so just the smell of it was nasty 

377.04 379.62 B: so is it still that way or [noise] 

377.33 377.97 A: (( um )) 

378.74 381.42 A: it's still that way [sigh] yeah um 

381.71 383.97 A: my girlfriend that i babysit her kids 

384.26 385.77 A: uh her and her 

385.58 399.28 A: husband are both heavy smokers and i just practically strip her children naked when they get in the house and put everything their car seats and diaper bags in the corner and leave them there [laughter] and and put clothes put the other clothes on because i 

395.06 395.94 B: right 

396.64 397.49 B: well 

399.43 401.63 A: because it just reeks off of everything 

401.33 405.09 B: right so i mean really her habit 

401.98 402.76 A: so 

405.23 408.52 B: affects you in a in a pretty dramatic way 

407.90 409.80 A: yeah yeah it does and 

409.02 413.91 B: so even though if she's not smoking around you you're it's still affecting you so 

412.06 412.97 A: yeah 

414.13 416.61 A: yeah that's just you know drinking 

417.06 423.98 A: i can't say that i've stopped but since i've had children it's you know i just threw away last year's m- ah 

424.02 425.35 A: drink mixer 

425.11 426.31 B: oh [laughter] okay 

425.39 428.57 A: from last new year's eve right before this christmas 

428.28 430.30 B: oh okay [laughter] 

428.87 433.21 A: so you know [sigh] can't say it's a major thing in this house anymore 

431.42 434.98 B: (( i d- i don't think i don't think it's a major effect on your life nah )) 

434.32 441.00 A: yeah your priorities get shifted so major when the kids come too you know it's the diapers or a six pack hmm 

440.79 443.61 B: [laughter] 

441.09 442.63 A: let me see 

442.89 446.19 A: i'm glad i don't smoke and i'm happy we can afford to live it's not like 

446.17 447.29 B: right 

446.33 448.34 A: it's expensive as it is now [noise] 

448.74 454.26 A: it's you know how can you [laughter] feed yourself and your children and spend a hundred dollars a week on cigarettes 

453.91 455.10 B: right 

454.49 455.96 A: it's just crazy 

456.59 468.78 B: well i mean you know actually that would could be an effect on a family by it other than the secondhand smoke or you know because you know if you're addicted to cigarettes and unable to quit smoking then 

463.19 464.50 A: exactly 

464.73 465.79 A: financial 

468.90 472.49 B: you know your family could be doing without as a result of it so 

470.48 471.75 A: exactly 

472.55 474.41 B: [sigh] but i 

473.01 475.56 A: that kinda throws that back in that line [laughter] 

475.29 476.02 B: (( hm )) 

476.04 479.14 A: i say it kinda throws it back in that line and out of self 

479.17 481.19 A: ah desecration i would imagine 

479.28 480.11 B: right 

481.10 482.36 B: right 

481.53 487.61 A: (( thank you dear thank you thank you hang on one second but ah yeah )) 

483.26 484.46 B: [laughter] 

487.87 488.99 A: i don't know 

488.40 489.11 B: but 

489.85 496.45 B: you know as far as as you know gossiping which we both said you know hurts other people oh 

495.12 496.17 A: mhm 

497.61 502.63 B: you know like i said i come from a long line of of proud gossips that 

502.71 506.34 B: almost feel that i'm denying them something 

506.39 519.52 B: if i decline to gossip you know i've got an aunt that continuously tries to get me to talk about a former co worker you know what have i heard what have i heard and you know and it's it's finally 

506.43 509.55 A: (( [noise] [laughter] right [noise] )) 

516.32 517.91 A: right 

519.45 528.80 B: i guess some of 'em'll realize when i've i've resigned [laughter] you know from the from the gossip club or something and because they 

522.51 525.01 A: [laughter] 

527.77 528.56 A: right 

528.98 536.11 B: you know it it it actually gets easier after a while just because they quit coming to me because they don't get the satisfaction you know 

532.79 534.77 A: they stop asking [laughter] 

536.71 546.75 B: but oh you know you know when he listed um i just thought i didn't even think of caffeine because you know i'm like you i do that [laughter] [laughter] 

544.41 545.58 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

545.98 549.80 A: i used to be really bad i used to go through a couple of ah 

550.02 552.93 A: dr peppers a day when i worked in retail 

552.60 553.74 B: right 

553.08 555.49 A: you know you don't realize that you go through 

556.42 563.74 A: you know i'd go through three or four twenty ounce dr peppers [noise] in a day and they were and like a candy bar a day that's horrible but ah 

560.14 561.08 B: right 

564.44 565.80 B: (( [noise] oh well [noise] )) 

564.59 567.18 A: i can't i can't handle it now i don't know if it's 

567.50 577.33 A: just from being away from it or just getting older but you know when we're when we're out on our weekends at you know we run the roads and everything we'll stop and everybody'll get a pop at the gas station

587.34 588.56 B: oh gee

590.91 592.01 B: right 

591.20 596.92 A: but the caffeine i have to have my tea if i can't have anything else go ahead you can get some go ahead [noise]
