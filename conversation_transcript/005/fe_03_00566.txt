74.04 74.47 B: uh-huh 

74.93 78.94 A: you know and as far as the other reality show like millionaire and all that stuff

81.58 83.19 B: no you've seen them but you're not interested 

83.69 84.52 A: well i seen 

84.93 88.44 A: you know commercials for -em i haven't really sat down and took the time to watch -em 

86.26 86.60 B: uh-huh 

87.50 87.97 B: -eah 

89.63 90.13 B: well what do you 

90.39 92.09 B: do you think it's because uh i mean uh 

92.40 95.99 B: i just heard something on the radio about uh rea- reality television 

96.35 97.20 B: and why the 

97.92 100.38 B: the television companies make them -cause they're cheaper 

100.81 106.00 B: and uh to make than regular t._v. but it doesn't that doesn't really explain like why people are so 

106.35 107.44 B: into them i know 

107.58 109.33 B: so many people find it interesting 

109.50 111.71 B: i actually used to watch okay 

109.85 110.28 A: right 

111.97 112.81 B: the real world 

112.91 114.21 B: have you ever watched that 

114.58 116.36 A: it's like on m._t._v. or something isn't it 

115.43 116.60 B: yeah yeah 

116.89 117.76 A: yeah 

117.42 121.59 B: and uh gosh i had forgotten that and uh i'm a little too old to watch it i'm in my late 

122.38 125.56 B: uh thirties but uh it was a few years ago and i had this friend 

123.17 123.76 A: uh-huh 

125.98 127.08 B: and we would stay on 

127.24 129.60 B: the phone like until one o'clock in the morning we 

129.71 132.39 B: she lived in on part of massachusetts where i'm at and 

132.67 133.13 A: right 

133.07 134.05 B: i lived in another 

134.59 139.06 B: and uh we would talk about the real world and i knew all the characters and 

139.66 142.91 B: i guess i found it engaging i guess it's kind of like a way to 

143.57 144.77 B: it's like a soap oper- 

144.67 146.31 A: yeah kind of like 

145.08 145.55 B: but it's 

145.98 147.33 B: real yeah probably 

146.94 147.49 A: yeah 

147.89 149.09 B: probably the same way 

149.67 155.15 B: the same reason people like s- soap operas is like you can kind of live you life through these other people you know 

154.83 156.97 A: yeah -ell i definitely get into soap operas 

156.79 157.98 B: oh you do yeah 

157.51 158.50 A: oh definitely 

158.25 158.68 B: mhm 

158.98 165.20 A: definitely that's i mean i'd i'd watch those over survivor and all the reality shows any day 

159.37 159.88 B: yeah 

164.34 164.83 B: uh-huh 

165.66 166.13 A: yeah 

165.89 166.49 B: yeah 

166.84 168.89 B: do you have friends that watch uh reality t._v. 

169.77 171.87 A: i don't really know they never talk about it 

172.28 172.88 B: yeah 

172.57 174.65 A: so i don't think they watched it 

174.67 175.35 B: yeah 

175.08 176.19 A: eh i mean 

176.81 178.49 A: it's a deal it's all right 

178.45 178.73 B: yeah 

178.83 182.82 A: but i mean once you get to a certain point i mean that's about it 

183.31 185.85 B: yeah that's what i sometimes i wonder -cause maybe 

186.39 191.92 B: like people are busy and they're working more hours now than they have ever worked at work and so like when you come home 

192.32 192.69 A: mhm 

192.45 198.04 B: maybe you don't have some of the things that people used to do in the community so you get to watch other people living and 

198.17 198.86 A: right 

198.70 201.00 B: also as i think (( probably )) a way that people 

201.42 209.46 B: i can imagine people c- feel superior like when you see somebody on those shows even i know with m._t._v. who has a a difficult personality you can think 

209.80 210.24 A: mhm 

209.85 212.16 B: well i'm not like that fool you know what i mean like 

211.78 212.37 A: right 

212.63 213.15 B: -eah 

213.43 215.80 B: -cause the other the other one i watch is uh 

213.53 213.90 A: right 

216.88 217.84 B: the blind date 

218.35 218.73 B: thing 

218.96 221.82 A: oh okay i've seen that on uh 

222.00 223.77 A: on television blind date 

223.61 225.18 B: yeah a- and i l- 

224.23 227.71 A: yeah okay i watch tho- i watch those late they come on 

226.90 231.59 B: an- i d- know if that's reality t._v. seems like it is it's real person yeah i i like that one 

229.42 230.09 A: yeah 

231.99 234.34 B: because you just you never know what's going to happen 

233.78 238.29 A: right well i see they and where i live at i live in new york state they come on 

237.40 237.87 B: uh-huh 

238.40 239.44 A: they come on late night 

239.54 241.37 B: yeah that's i'm up pretty late yeah 

243.56 243.99 B: uh-huh 

247.61 248.13 B: uh-huh 

251.22 251.89 A: that whole 

252.08 253.25 A: couple thing 

253.50 254.18 B: yeah 

253.56 255.31 A: i i like watching i mean i like that 

255.50 257.73 B: yeah me too i don't know why i just do 

258.19 260.43 B: i saw one i was watching with some friends 

260.96 264.06 B: and we watched it once and i don't think i get the channel tha- -t's on 

264.36 266.14 B: they have this show called cheaters 

265.73 266.86 A: yeah 

267.02 267.71 B: an- uh 

267.95 268.66 B: an- uh 

268.82 272.28 B: and i think people watch that just like the reason they watch cops like to 

272.64 274.88 B: just kind of like a a a thrill because 

275.22 278.42 B: they bust these people when they're cheatin- you know have you seen that 

277.34 278.13 A: yeah 

278.43 280.18 A: yeah i seen cheaters too 

279.07 279.42 B: we- 

279.96 282.72 B: oh i think i think the camera crew is going to get 

282.85 285.31 B: killed some day though you know that's like 

285.78 287.96 B: i mean that is just a hostile issue and 

288.09 288.97 A: oh yeah 

288.28 288.55 B: an 

289.09 290.09 B: and i think it's like 

290.74 295.07 B: yeah i i guess you just i mean for me i just you get horrified at what people are doin- and 

295.61 297.38 B: and so y- you kind of get this like 

297.80 298.54 B: you're living t- 

298.67 300.45 B: i think maybe people like live through 

300.61 303.09 B: living through the t._v. a little bit i don't really know 

302.49 303.10 A: right 

303.71 304.22 B: yeah 

304.38 307.51 A: i don't know americans americans we do a lot of 

307.63 308.51 A: crazy stuff 

308.94 309.52 B: yeah 

309.48 313.36 A: so you know and t._v.'s a lot of th- a lot of part of everyone's life 

313.18 316.36 B: it is a huge part i watch a lot of t._v. uh unfor- 

316.66 319.44 B: i mean i i got rid of my t._v. for a couple of years to try to 

320.01 321.54 B: not watch so much t._v. but 

321.23 321.77 A: right 

322.01 323.93 B: i don't think it's possible for me yeah 

329.59 332.46 A: and i could tell you what was on television every day 

331.58 331.97 B: yeah 

332.37 332.87 B: yeah 

332.56 340.03 A: you know on different stations and now uh you know i got certain you know today's wednesday what's we watch such and such so 

334.14 334.64 B: yeah 

339.74 340.16 B: yeah 

340.34 341.57 B: yeah i'm like that too 

340.67 342.15 A: you know so 

342.25 342.83 B: yeah 

342.60 349.75 A: t._v.'s definitely a part of everyone's life and and i guess reality t._v. is just uh the new thing of the twenty first century 

344.48 344.85 B: uh-huh 

349.59 350.10 B: yeah 

350.34 350.83 B: yeah 

350.51 350.98 A: y- know 

351.73 352.78 B: yeah i think it's uh 

353.24 354.77 B: well i think it's more interesting 

355.12 358.27 B: i think it i- part of it is more interesting because it's spontaneous like 

358.67 360.43 B: like the sitcoms are s- like 

361.81 363.28 B: they're repetitive you know like 

362.91 363.94 A: right 

363.73 367.84 B: like if you're our a- i mean i'm in my if you've been watching t._v. for twenty years 

368.26 369.82 B: there's nothing new 

370.00 373.72 B: about a sitcom you know and even dramas and stuff like that it's only 

371.25 372.18 A: right 

374.18 376.78 B: you can only do so many things you know and then it's 

375.89 379.11 A: right there's all much so many things man can can think of 

378.87 379.47 B: yeah 

379.41 386.28 A: you know on the basis of having to sit down and writing it other than you know natural life playing itself 

382.84 383.34 B: yeah 

385.83 387.84 B: yeah i think that's part of it it's more 

387.10 387.61 A: you know 

387.95 389.16 B: it's just more interesting 

389.16 389.71 A: right 

389.78 394.39 B: until ho- how to be a millionaire was that the show where they which which one's that 

394.33 396.77 A: d- -do the man who's he's like a married 

397.23 397.94 A: no he's a 

398.59 400.02 A: he's playin- a millionaire 

399.83 401.53 B: oh yeah i heard about that 

401.04 409.15 A: yeah but he's actually not a millionaire yeah that show that's like i mean i like that's like a bunch of con- you know lies and jump street 

403.17 403.63 B: yeah 

409.28 409.75 B: yeah 

409.73 418.37 A: you know this woman has her pictured life for herself and find out that her man only makes nineteen thousand a year as an construction worker you know 

412.32 413.10 B: eh 

418.08 423.49 B: i know i think that's a good a lot of my friends are mad they i i've talked to some friends about this 

423.64 427.97 B: they think that's a really bad idea but i think it's kind of funny in a way because 

429.26 431.54 B: i don't know it's like uh because i- 

430.55 434.31 A: well it teaches her a lesson i gu- guarantee that 

432.10 435.62 B: exactly about wh- wh- where are your values at you know 

435.27 436.75 A: yeah definitely 

436.49 441.00 B: well i do know that's that's one show that i've heard people talking about and they're sayin- uh 

441.73 445.95 B: they're saying that uh they don't like that idea they think it's unfair to the women you know 

445.71 447.12 A: yeah definitely 

446.38 448.08 B: it's a bad idea yeah 

447.52 448.46 A: i think it is 

448.93 451.48 B: well i think it's going to be humiliating for them 

451.56 455.03 A: oh definitely when they find out at the end of you know this whole 

455.53 455.94 A: (( that was )) 

456.14 458.49 A: thing they're going through with this guy that 

458.72 461.23 A: you know this guy don't have no money at all 

460.58 461.54 B: yeah nothing 

461.36 462.40 A: you know 

463.13 465.16 A: you know you're trying to please this man 

465.53 469.72 A: basically for nothing because he has he's just like you an average joe 

470.37 470.77 B: yeah 

470.77 473.38 A: you know and they're looking for this millionaire life 

473.55 476.52 A: but like i said america likes stuff like that 

476.67 478.12 A: all kind of controversy 

478.21 480.95 B: yeah yeah i've never watched the cops shows have you 

481.00 482.99 A: well yeah i've seen cops 

483.24 484.77 A: you know i've watched cops and 

484.91 490.07 A: you know them shows and basically it's just it's a way to in all and all 

490.16 491.07 A: survivor 

491.53 492.77 A: you know millionaire 

493.38 494.89 A: them cop shows 

495.03 501.13 A: it's nothing but controversy you know just nothing but fightin- in in some form of or manner 

496.89 497.45 B: yeah 

501.24 504.68 A: that's all that it is and that's what america likes 

504.98 507.21 B: well it's almost like uh watching the w._w._f. 

507.37 508.26 A: right 

507.95 511.08 B: which isn't really that's all staged but it's the same kind of like 

511.43 512.04 A: right 

511.82 513.68 B: controversy and high drama and 

513.52 521.71 A: well yeah because i mean this way i mean the more controversy that survivor gets between their couples the better their ratings are going to go up each week 

521.78 522.11 B: yeah 

522.44 528.92 A: you know you want to tune in to see john and and may fight or wh- y- you know whatever 

522.48 522.85 B: yeah 

528.43 533.17 B: mhm yeah yeah well the same with m._t._v. you know if everybody was getting on 

529.20 530.22 A: mhm 

533.28 537.12 B: uh the real world which i watched if everyone was being harmonious you wouldn't 

537.74 539.07 B: know you wouldn't want to eh you know 

539.25 541.06 B: if it was little house on the prairie 

541.42 548.88 B: reality t._v. you'd probably tune out pretty soon you know what i mean if everyone was all lovin- ea- well you know there's no conflict you know 

544.75 545.32 A: right 

550.21 550.52 B: yeah 

553.06 553.53 B: yeah 

560.46 560.94 B: yeah 

567.11 567.51 B: yeah 

567.62 568.22 A: you know 

567.63 568.08 B: yeah
