193.78 198.16 B: whatever they have on there and they they're just they're just so stupid i don't know 

198.72 200.26 B: it's it's not even really uh 

200.49 204.97 B: well it's not even really reality t._v. on some of them because they take them out of context so much you know 

205.25 206.11 A: correct 

205.48 205.87 B: and when the 

205.97 209.09 B: when the people know they're on t._v. it's not the same thing uh th- 

209.29 210.79 B: they're acting for it they're 

211.15 214.24 B: more emotional than they'd probably be otherwise 

214.58 215.06 A: (( )) 

215.55 216.32 B: uh 

216.19 218.50 A: did did you ever watch the osbournes

219.76 222.58 B: oh okay i'm calling a couple of the osbournes 

222.07 225.35 A: yeah see well i never watched any of it but um 

225.85 230.69 A: they were on so many different news programs and i was like oh i could never watch that 

231.32 232.77 A: course i'm 

232.90 238.72 A: definitely a generation older than you it's my kids who're students you know 

239.37 240.12 B: um 

239.52 241.84 A: i i can tell from your voice you know 

241.84 245.63 B: well i think he's like what he's like seventy five now or something 

244.59 250.78 A: no i don't (( )) maybe late fifties 

252.79 253.17 B: uh 

253.94 257.87 B: yeah i i look at i guess i do watch some of them i i've caught the osbournes a couple of times th- 

257.15 257.82 A: mhm 

258.50 265.19 B: i i that's just funny though (( )) walking around all (( )) bloody (( )) it was a dumb dog and 

266.43 267.59 B: can't even speak right 

268.47 269.47 A: mhm 

269.85 271.88 A: i don't know they're gonna have one where they're just gonna 

271.99 273.15 A: (( )) family 

273.56 275.36 A: called my life is a sitcom 

276.10 280.16 A: starting next month i i don't think i'll watch it but um 

280.66 281.19 A: you know 

281.57 282.34 A: it would be like 

283.77 284.27 A: you know 

284.10 284.36 B: oh 

284.61 286.14 A: filming a normal li- 

288.23 289.41 A: oh 

289.46 291.81 B: (( )) i what what was the other question (( )) 

292.02 295.97 B: i think the reason why i i guess the reason why people watch reality t._v. shows 

296.43 301.93 B: or this is just what i would guess is that when when you watch like prime time t._v. when you watch these sitcoms 

302.53 305.06 B: they they they're all pretty much the same story 

305.20 305.84 A: mhm 

305.44 306.69 B: and and with these uh 

307.23 313.54 B: just really really poorly scripted jokes you know you can you can it's predictable you know you know what's going to happen you can 

313.18 313.60 A: hm 

314.05 318.92 B: you can feel like what character's gonna do what what someone's going to say (( )) they they just have these uh 

319.23 323.58 B: real two dimensional story lines that are just so easy to see see through that when uh 

323.93 327.29 B: when you have a reality t._v. show these people aren't really actors so 

327.84 330.27 B: they don't proje- even though they aren't projecting 

330.54 333.39 B: i don't know whatever about their personality out that way it's still 

333.86 340.24 B: i guess i guess it still has that sense of it being closer to life and closer to being entertainment than what they put on the networks now 

340.54 342.69 A: right particularly with sitcoms 

343.69 344.12 A: i 

344.75 349.45 A: they're all stupid and you're right i mean they're um 

347.32 347.95 B: uh 

350.83 351.87 A: very predictable 

352.23 354.24 A: it's the same old story 

354.72 355.75 B: it it's like uh 

355.10 356.24 A: so 

356.08 361.29 B: a filler space for the commercials you know just something to put in for seven minutes before they can put another commercial on in 

361.55 361.99 A: mhm 

362.36 368.91 A: and then and in the meantime they have e- enough commercials right in the program where they're using uh 

362.59 363.27 B: uh 

369.23 371.87 A: pepsi or coke or you know 

370.81 371.78 B: all right all right 

373.02 374.35 B: product endorsement 

374.41 375.04 A: right 

376.63 376.88 B: hm 

377.27 378.03 A: hm 

379.28 380.22 A: (( )) um 

381.05 382.19 A: i guess it's uh 

382.87 386.38 A: it's a family (( )) that you think a normal person could possibly 

387.39 387.80 A: do 

388.29 388.87 A: you know 

390.02 390.87 B: i guess so 

392.27 398.78 B: i mean i swear that's what t._v. is anyways it's kind of putting your brain on hold for however long kind of spacing out into it 

399.60 403.34 B: forgetting about what you're doing what you gotta work on and all that stuff 

403.82 404.20 A: right 

406.34 409.35 A: once you're an addict to it like uh 

409.87 414.20 A: they (( )) one program watching another program 

415.04 417.59 A: of course i've watched i watch dramas 

418.05 420.11 A: and reality programs 

418.35 418.76 B: uh 

420.70 422.08 B: have you ever caught the simpsons 

422.81 423.79 A: the simpsons 

423.84 425.11 B: yeah the simpsons on fox 

424.27 424.99 A: oh y- 

425.22 425.72 A: oh yeah 

426.27 426.84 B: that's 

427.04 432.25 B: that's you see that's the one show that i watch regardless every sunday eight o'clock i'm there 

433.16 434.67 B: i that's 

435.15 440.42 B: if they i think they should make more simpsons programs that's what they need to do they need a all simpsons all the time network 

441.14 445.73 A: what's now the it's officially now the longest running sitcom ever 

446.15 446.95 B: is it for real 

446.54 450.74 A: read that in today's paper so because they got another 

451.11 453.14 A: four year extension or something 

453.28 454.23 B: jeeze 

454.27 459.04 A: it's my husband's one of his favorite programs so um 

459.16 460.51 B: he's got good taste 

461.64 464.16 A: or worse sense of humor 

464.33 469.02 A: no we used to watch it all the time but now it's more of um 

469.42 470.91 A: if there's nothing else on 

475.46 476.05 B: uh 

476.25 483.63 A: no i don't know uh i'm trying to think um you know what i think is really weird is how the news programs 

483.73 484.54 A: like um 

484.88 487.22 A: our local news they'll be 

487.77 488.81 A: promoing 

489.46 494.11 A: they who wants to marry a millionaire or the bachelor or whatever and they'll be discussing 

494.45 495.80 A: you know like what do you think and 

496.36 498.62 A: i think that's bad that the news 

499.42 500.11 B: oh yeah 

499.96 500.73 A: is has 

501.09 504.12 A: themselves become a commercial for the program 

504.30 504.91 A: you know 

505.19 509.75 B: all right well they're they're all syndicated by the same network that's running these programs and 

509.58 510.03 A: right 

510.64 512.85 B: really cuts down on the variety that we get 

514.84 515.59 B: i think (( )) 

515.90 516.58 B: and i guess 

517.27 521.70 B: that that's that's a shame too because when you when i watch the news and i see that they're donating like 

521.83 525.52 B: two to three minutes to uh talking about reality t._v. programs 

526.35 533.41 B: and you just you just know that there's so much uh there's so much happening in the world right now that they don't report on and they don't actually give 

533.82 537.12 B: even thirty seconds to to discuss to the public you know 

537.33 537.77 A: mhm 

537.94 547.00 B: and so you we have important issues just passing through the public eye every day that don't actually get noticed just because the news media doesn't pick up on -em because they're reporting on stuff like 

547.44 549.05 B: who wants to a marry a millionaire or 

549.65 552.10 B: joe is it joe millionaire is that what it is now 

551.62 554.45 A: joe millionaire now and the bachelorette 

554.92 555.39 B: eh 

555.25 559.48 A: i haven't watched either of them but i've seen enough on them you know on 

560.07 560.87 A: just on 

561.43 567.12 A: the today show or you know um oprah those types of programs pushing 

567.83 568.33 B: uh
