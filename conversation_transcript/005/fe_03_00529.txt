9.51 10.60 A: yeah it is 

12.88 13.65 A: (( oh please )) 

12.90 14.92 B: okay 

14.96 16.86 A: did you have your uh paper in front of you 

16.96 20.06 A: you had to decide about what personal habits you wanted to talk about 

20.83 23.92 B: not really 

23.23 24.84 A: oh okay 

24.25 27.06 B: (( like i said )) i'm kind of new at this so 

27.05 30.44 A: yeah well me too so we're on the same boat 

29.32 32.22 B: just kind of play it by ear 

31.67 32.21 A: um 

32.33 35.02 A: did it-did he go a little too fast for you about what 

35.35 36.60 A: we're supposed to talk about 

36.76 37.54 B: (( i don't get )) 

38.48 39.29 A: ah these are 

38.69 40.04 B: i uh i i guess (( )) 

40.68 41.87 A: personal habits 

42.60 44.32 A: uh what we think is worse 

45.15 47.32 A: gossiping smoking 

48.05 49.80 A: uh drinking too much 

50.00 51.72 A: alcohol or caffeine 

52.14 54.50 A: overeating or not exercising 

55.84 56.39 B: mm 

57.13 64.83 B: well let me see (( personally )) i know my bad habit is not exercising and probably overeating 

66.50 76.15 B: but i think the worst one is smoking and excessive alcohol i think that's the worse thing anybody can do to their body 

75.53 76.10 A: um 

78.99 81.00 B: cause it can lead to a lot of health problems 

82.49 84.16 B: and a lot of personal problems 

84.39 86.07 B: work problems 

86.23 86.81 A: yeah 

87.41 88.00 A: um 

87.62 90.37 B: you name it 

90.19 95.68 A: i guess none of them are really good choices but um i i guess 

97.43 99.35 A: even though it says personal habits 

99.65 100.27 A: it says 

100.60 101.21 A: um 

101.77 103.38 A: which do we think is worse 

104.14 106.94 A: and so i'm going to have to say something like 

107.66 108.66 A: either 

109.93 111.88 A: maybe the smoking 

112.93 116.39 A: or the alcohol even though gossiping isn't really nice either 

116.55 118.95 B: no it's not 

116.93 118.10 A: but uh i um 

118.31 119.47 A: i'm thinking about 

120.11 120.60 A: um 

121.57 122.54 A: both of those 

122.75 123.36 A: uh 

123.70 126.32 A: the alcohol and the uh smoking 

126.57 128.67 A: they can harm so many other people 

128.54 130.58 B: that's right 

129.23 129.77 A: (( so it's )) 

130.14 131.10 A: not just like 

131.25 132.61 A: you know you're doing something 

132.84 134.15 A: bad to yourself 

134.81 135.55 A: you know you're 

136.66 139.37 A: uh putting other people's lives in danger too 

140.70 145.91 B: that's very true especially with alcohol so many of the drunk drivers 

146.54 147.95 B: so many people getting hurt 

150.02 150.66 A: um 

150.21 153.41 B: so many people you know they get drunk and then they want to just 

154.14 156.79 B: you know they go crazy 

156.33 157.24 A: ahem yes 

157.17 161.57 B: get behind the wheel of a car or just plain go crazy 

161.89 166.52 A: and uh if p- if people uh get in an accident and they die that's one thing 

166.92 177.25 A: but uh what about the people who live and wh- and then then are maybe crippled for all of their lives or brain damaged or something you know that's really really horrible 

172.99 175.13 B: that's very true 

177.55 181.52 B: oh yes we have uh someone right here where i live 

181.67 182.76 B: um 

183.11 184.58 B: that um 

184.91 191.63 B: that got hit head on and she was a model very promising career 

191.94 194.00 B: very promising life and now she's like 

194.29 197.51 B: (( )) 

196.47 197.54 A: oh my goodness 

198.24 207.38 B: and it was a very horrible accident and the guy had been drinking (( )) way over the legal limit 

207.66 208.31 A: that uh- 

207.76 210.46 B: i mean he's remorseful now 

210.42 213.19 A: yeah of course always when it's too late 

211.01 211.36 B: (( but )) 

211.94 214.75 B: that doesn't do any good for the family 

214.09 214.76 A: yeah 

215.99 219.13 B: (( i mean )) she was lucky i mean she was single 

219.24 221.60 B: so at least she didn't leave any children behind 

221.82 222.99 A: yeah that's good 

222.01 222.97 B: (( )) 

223.17 225.82 B: what about these people that leave kids behind 

226.32 228.17 B: you know 

228.62 235.38 B: because they you know they hit somebody and they maybe hit a family that has kids 

235.59 237.85 B: and they killed the parents 

237.39 239.46 A: and and did you um 

240.91 242.47 A: read the stories about 

242.62 245.20 A: how often it is that the person who's drunk 

245.50 248.84 A: comes out like totally unscratched or something 

248.89 249.97 B: right 

249.57 253.77 A: and it's like i guess they have enough booze in them that you know 

253.84 255.85 B: their bodies are numb 

253.94 254.20 A: it 

255.43 256.59 A: yeah and 

256.10 257.73 B: they don't feel nothing 

257.51 259.63 A: they they kill kill other people and 

259.98 261.57 A: and they come out just as 

261.88 263.14 A: peachy as can be 

264.17 265.41 B: i know it's horrible 

267.59 268.37 B: i 

268.60 271.92 B: i mean i i drink but i don't drink enough to worry about it 

272.10 273.58 B: (( you )) know maybe once and 

273.88 277.65 B: six months maybe 

277.92 280.10 B: i just i don't believe in drinking 

280.30 282.16 B: i've i've lived with alcoholics 

282.60 286.64 B: i've been around alcoholics no thank you i've seen what it can do 

288.05 288.96 B: (( )) 

291.02 291.93 B: not a pretty sight 

292.68 294.04 A: no and i think that's 

294.17 295.46 A: my um 

296.06 298.04 A: my view on it too because 

298.34 302.77 A: i i don't really know if my father was alcoholic i kind of tend to think so 

303.41 304.57 A: but i do know 

306.08 306.86 A: that 

307.08 309.51 A: uh i always felt like he drank too much 

310.25 311.27 A: and um 

313.56 315.46 A: and he would become mean 

316.40 316.91 A: and 

317.13 319.02 A: i i will never forget 

319.48 320.13 A: um 

320.84 322.18 A: we were in the process of 

322.53 323.89 A: of moving from 

324.13 325.36 A: pennsylvania 

325.77 327.79 A: uh to ohio and we would keep 

328.17 331.76 A: uh he he wanted to travel back and forth every weekend 

332.50 333.69 A: and um 

335.85 339.17 A: i i can remember the times when he would be so angry 

339.68 340.22 A: that that 

340.67 343.34 A: he he would actually say you know well 

343.69 345.22 A: okay i'm going to um 

348.42 352.13 A: i'll give you uh uh a silly example i mean not really silly but 

352.55 353.93 A: this is ridiculous 

354.44 355.46 A: that um 

355.89 357.10 A: like my mom would 

357.39 357.87 A: say 

358.20 360.24 A: well you know i kind of have to use 

360.33 361.82 A: the ladies' room 

362.40 365.10 A: and he would say well why didn't you say something 

365.25 366.81 A: back there or whatever 

367.36 367.79 A: and (( she )) 

368.13 371.31 A: you know naturally she didn't have to go back there 

371.41 372.62 B: yeah 

371.50 373.26 A: and now she does and 

373.67 374.75 A: he would get just 

374.96 375.87 A: so furious 

376.42 378.33 A: and he would actually 

379.65 380.27 A: um 

381.41 384.13 A: aim the car at a tree 

385.44 385.95 A: and 

386.07 387.39 A: and actually 

387.69 389.12 A: go toward the tree 

389.78 390.40 A: um 

392.54 394.71 A: in an attempt to hit it i guess cause 

394.81 395.38 A: you know 

396.30 398.59 A: uh but then y- he never did 

399.48 400.42 A: but (( )) 

401.51 403.12 A: that was so cruel 

403.68 405.79 B: yes (( i can like )) see what you're saying 

406.41 408.04 A: you know (( )) 

408.18 410.85 A: three of us kids in the back and we were scared to death 

411.38 412.29 A: and uh 

413.41 415.73 A: you know you didn't know what to do you didn't know whether to 

415.91 418.27 A: to sleep on these trips so that 

418.62 426.94 A: if something bad happens you wouldn't uh be awake or if you should stay awake in case something bad happens so you'd know about it 

427.37 428.59 A: it was terrible 

427.40 429.88 B: oh yeah i can see the point there 

430.87 433.85 A: so uh i don't drink at all 

434.00 434.98 A: and um 

436.32 437.75 A: uh i had told 

437.95 439.13 A: uh my husband 

439.47 439.76 A: bef- 

439.86 441.16 A: before we married 

441.54 442.44 A: that uh 

442.62 445.42 A: he was like occasional beer drinker 

446.06 447.42 A: and i said no no no 

447.56 449.91 A: i- if you drink we will not marry 

451.22 452.34 A: and so he gave it up 

454.30 462.32 B: that's love that's definitely love [laugh] well i lived with an alcoholic husband 

462.55 469.74 B: i have the bruises to prove it i mean it just i understand what it can do to people 

469.86 477.68 B: only too well and i mean you know and then you know you were saying smoking too 

470.94 472.38 A: wow 

477.78 480.97 B: my my stepfather died of emphysema 

481.07 483.16 B: even though he quit smoking 

483.28 487.68 B: about mm ten eleven years ago 

487.92 488.63 A: wow 

487.95 488.58 B: he quit 

489.01 493.60 B: he didn't even he got emphysema after he quit smoking really bad and he died from it 

495.57 500.33 B: and well actually everybody in my family smokes except for me 

499.67 500.22 A: oh 

501.74 503.21 B: i 

502.26 503.32 A: you're the smart one 

503.55 508.25 B: no i actually have a mother that told me if i ever started smoking she'd beat me 

508.48 510.21 A: oh 

509.23 519.53 B: oh i'm more scared of my mother than i would enjoy sm- than a cigarette because my mom probably would even at my age she probably still would 

520.40 523.54 B: i mean she my mom's got the beginnings of emphysema 

525.04 528.05 B: and she's trying really hard to quit smoking 

527.75 528.36 A: oh

530.86 534.37 B: god well um forty years 

535.20 542.94 B: you know i i understand what smoking can do to you too cause i've seen it firsthand it's lung cancer and 

543.27 545.50 B: it doesn't only hurt you but 

545.59 549.31 B: now they're finding out secondhand smoke kills you too 

549.42 550.01 A: yeah 

550.36 553.10 B: and they say secondhand smoke is worse than firsthand smoke 

553.68 556.71 A: yeah you know what i i've been around a lot of smokers 

557.25 558.65 A: and um 

559.17 560.16 A: i just 

560.27 561.94 A: like within the past year 

562.45 564.50 A: found out that i have um 

566.02 566.65 A: uh 

567.92 568.69 A: asthma 

569.05 571.48 B: mm so do i 

570.78 572.40 A: and it's like 

573.47 575.66 A: that's where it had to have come from 

576.94 581.24 A: cause to go through al- you know all this life and not have anything happen 

578.44 578.95 B: (( yeah )) 

581.78 584.40 A: and then all of a sudden to crop up with asthma that's 

584.55 590.13 B: kind of weird 

584.66 585.28 A: you know 

587.03 587.47 A: strange

589.41 591.17 A: and um my 

593.14 598.46 A: uh well i have two older sisters but the one that's closest to me in age is the one i'm closest to
