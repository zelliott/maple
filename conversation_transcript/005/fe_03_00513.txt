25.01 27.53 B: you never i never really know down here because 

27.68 30.44 B: we get warmer weather and then it could be allergy 

30.48 31.52 A: well that's true 

31.85 32.23 B: you know 

31.89 34.18 A: that's true and it's hard to distinguish between the two 

34.99 37.13 B: right but i live i grew up in wisconsin 

37.55 39.07 A: oh i love wisconsin 

38.98 39.64 B: i don't 

39.92 40.81 A: no 

40.72 41.26 B: no 

41.70 43.99 A: well there's a lot of um allergy 

43.02 44.94 B: it's cold it's humid 

45.11 45.51 A: yeah 

45.61 46.69 B: and lots of snow 

46.78 49.88 B: and i hate cold humidity and snow 

46.83 47.29 A: yes 

48.93 53.41 A: i live really close to lake michigan and we get the lake effect snow 

53.27 53.66 B: mm 

53.69 55.99 A: and so when it snows it snows a lot 

54.41 55.11 B: mhm 

55.41 58.30 B: i was on the i was on the west side of lake michigan milwaukee 

57.84 58.35 A: oh 

60.07 60.47 B: so 

60.61 62.47 A: do you get lake effect snow on the other side 

63.59 64.32 B: sometimes 

64.36 65.12 A: sometimes 

65.72 69.23 B: but milwau- see what happens is is milwaukee gets all that um 

71.53 75.18 B: the way the storms come up from like out of texas and up it kind of hits 

76.15 79.26 B: south western wisconsin comes up through milwaukee and then hits 

79.36 79.89 B: the lake 

80.14 80.80 A: oh 

80.57 84.79 B: and if there's any kind of weather over the lake it stalls it then over milwaukee 

85.25 86.39 A: oh that's interesting 

87.55 89.78 A: i was just figuring we just always got your left overs 

90.30 94.57 B: that's why i i like it down here so much because we get climate change but not like up there 

95.58 99.68 A: so how would you be able to tell the difference if you had a cold or if you had an allergy 

100.00 102.16 A: other the going in for expensive testing 

104.78 111.20 B: usually if it's an allergy with me it only lasts like yesterday my sinuses were all clogged on the right side only 

111.33 111.76 A: mhm 

112.27 113.45 B: and now today they're fine 

113.88 114.89 A: oh okay 

114.40 116.87 B: so i'm more included to think it was an allergic reaction 

117.56 118.07 A: oh 

118.44 119.20 B: um 

120.04 120.90 B: colds 

121.79 123.53 B: i don't get that many of them down here 

123.87 124.24 A: no 

124.51 125.85 B: not like i used to get them up 

125.96 127.82 B: in the in the northern country years ago 

133.42 133.93 A: coughing 

134.29 136.12 A: this time she shared it with her mother 

136.36 137.05 B: oh good 

136.63 136.91 A: so 

137.10 147.25 A: i i have it too her's always start out with a fever and for the first twenty four hours we wonder if we're just dealing with a cold or something exciting but once again it was just a cold 

147.82 153.02 A: sinus problems drainage and i mean the normal symptoms and treat able with you know children's 

153.17 154.58 A: um cold products and 

154.53 154.87 B: yeah 

155.25 156.59 A: and then you go on but 

157.41 159.69 A: so my voice will go up and down 

159.79 161.11 A: while i clear 

161.50 163.62 B: yeah i don't usually do you 

163.75 166.11 B: i mean do you run to the doctor i don't 

166.20 170.20 A: you know i i don't like running to the doctor unless there's 

170.49 175.29 A: like when i said my daughter had a fever a controllable fever is normal in a child they said it 

175.41 178.98 A: part of the natural immune system fighting against an infection 

179.35 181.87 A: and to let it do its job just to make her comfortable 

182.23 184.99 A: but i will run to a doctor if a fever won't go away 

185.66 188.16 A: or if i know i'm getting complications from this 

188.60 193.55 B: that's what i used to do too when my kids were young if the fever stayed up over a hundred 

193.60 193.93 A: yes 

194.18 195.84 B: for more then a day and a half 

196.03 197.56 B: i would take them to the doctor 

197.75 198.71 A: well that makes perfect sense 

198.79 200.55 B: but if i can bring it down 

202.17 202.71 B: um 

202.96 203.60 B: i didn't 

204.29 208.88 B: i mean and and i'm glad now that i didn't because my children 

204.92 205.22 A: right 

209.25 209.97 B: can still 

210.88 212.32 B: take antibiotics 

213.11 217.62 B: they don't have the allergies i have because i grew up having chronic ear infections 

218.37 220.35 B: to the point where i can take in penicillin 

220.70 222.74 A: oh you had too many antibiotics 

222.95 223.56 B: yes 

223.13 224.14 A: i've heard of that 

224.11 226.90 B: yes i was constantly on antibiotics 

227.25 230.49 B: until i and by the time i turned thirteen i had a massive 

231.05 232.49 B: reaction to penicillin 

232.83 233.19 A: wow 

232.91 234.58 B: that in turned has turned into 

234.84 237.17 B: there are very few antibiotics i can take today 

237.42 237.88 A: i bet 

238.67 239.25 B: and 

239.41 243.27 B: now my grand my daughter my daughters are doing the same thing with my grandchildren 

244.07 245.91 B: unless it's absolutely necessary 

246.78 251.23 B: they're finding out that some of their great grandma's home remedies work just as well like the chicken soup 

251.44 252.07 A: oh yes 

252.21 253.93 B: and the menthalatum on the chest 

253.96 254.30 A: yes 

254.45 254.78 A: yup 

254.50 255.12 B: and 

255.41 255.89 B: you know 

257.45 263.77 B: to get those rather then constantly running to the doctor and pumping these children full of antibiotics that they may not really need 

263.99 267.50 A: and exposing them to the doctors office that has other children full of 

267.66 268.81 A: ailments and problems 

268.25 269.74 B: other ailments right 

269.87 270.12 A: yup 

270.12 270.77 B: right 

270.66 276.72 A: it's sometimes it's not (( )) and this time of the year um like right outside tonight it's about fifteen degrees 

277.77 282.46 A: in the daytime it only got up to twenty what am i risking by taking her out into the cold 

280.14 280.46 B: yeah 

282.35 283.19 B: into the cold 

283.14 287.14 A: right to get another chill if she's ill so we dealt with it at home and it 

287.42 291.47 A: more often then not it just seems better for myself i would rather tough it out 

292.12 292.76 B: i would too 

292.80 296.04 A: it's not just the money it it 

296.28 299.92 A: you know unless there's a complication i'd rather tough it out it will only last a few days 

299.87 300.21 B: well 

300.31 301.82 B: i think that may come to 

302.23 304.72 B: were you raised in the midwest up there 

305.27 309.19 A: yeah but i was raised by people who grew up in the south 

308.85 309.36 B: really 

309.38 314.15 A: yeah arkansas and north carolina is about as far north as you go 

314.35 314.96 B: just wondered 

315.22 316.78 B: because i've noticed down here 

317.43 317.75 B: that 

317.94 321.39 B: because there's such a large hispanic i'm in southern new mexico 

321.58 322.24 A: oh wow 

322.17 324.34 B: very close to the mexican border 

324.37 324.76 A: mhm 

325.28 328.37 B: and because there's a large hispanic and indian population 

329.27 332.28 B: rather then a lot of them rather then go to 

332.41 333.19 B: the doctor 

334.11 334.91 B: go to 

335.06 335.54 B: um 

336.56 337.35 B: the medicine woman 

337.70 338.36 A: oh really 

338.84 339.59 B: and 

339.98 341.13 B: use the herbs 

342.98 343.78 B: and seem to 

343.99 350.36 B: get a long fine with it i mean i myself am guilty of that there's this wonderful little old lady here in ours who's got to be ninety five 

350.44 351.18 A: wow 

351.52 354.36 B: but she knows her herbs and she knows what helps 

355.19 358.53 A: so that would be like my going to grandma's house and saying what would du recommend 

358.64 361.43 A: she would never recommend i would go to the doctor over a cold 

358.67 359.35 B: right 

360.95 361.40 B: right 

362.00 362.52 B: right 

362.75 363.88 A: so that makes perfect sense 

364.35 364.85 B: and 

365.04 369.02 B: with the way our health treatment our health care system is now and days 

369.83 375.02 A: yeah we have an h._m._o. so 

370.43 371.11 B: um 

375.03 377.41 B: i'm i that's the way i feel about a lot of it 

377.59 378.01 A: well i 

377.61 378.50 B: i really do 

378.58 383.59 A: i remember picking up the vaporizer and the vicks and just keeping certain things stocked in the house 

383.81 384.53 A: and um 

384.83 385.89 A: when they've come in handy 

386.16 386.79 B: oh yeah 

386.88 388.09 A: they've come in handy many times 

388.27 390.96 B: and the (( menthalatum )) works really good too 

391.29 392.10 A: oh i didn't know it 

391.68 395.26 B: only in that it opens up the nasal passages without having to use those 

396.35 400.01 B: spray things from the store whatever that you become addicted to that then 

399.58 400.45 A: that's what i heard 

400.68 401.12 B: you know 

401.50 404.08 A: i heard that um even eye drops can become a problem 

404.39 407.01 B: yes they can because then your eyes won't tear on their own 

407.16 407.70 A: right 

409.07 413.33 B: i mean all these wonderful inventions that they've come up with and everything and i sometimes wonder 

409.12 409.73 A: well that's (( right )) 

413.76 415.24 A: if we're doing more harm then good 

415.28 416.62 B: more harm then good right 

416.93 417.56 A: yeah 

417.13 418.95 B: i i fell that way too 

419.44 421.31 B: i wonder why their so many more incidents 

423.13 423.84 A: that's true 

424.40 425.16 A: we have um 

424.69 427.22 B: then there was and hundred ago per 

428.25 435.51 B: per pop per capita and i don't think it was because they couldn't diagnose it because they already knew what cancer was they just didn't know what to do with it 

429.89 430.22 A: right 

436.33 441.01 B: i think it's because people weren't constantly running to the doctors and they didn't have all the chemicals in their foods 

441.75 442.69 A: oh that's true 

442.91 449.77 B: and i also wonder if we don't see more colds and more flu because of people getting the antibiotics their immune systems 

450.67 452.34 B: don't know hot to fight anything anymore 

452.88 453.92 A: well that's definitely true 

454.57 457.12 A: hey were talking about how the students 

457.59 459.79 A: can pass around a disease 

460.10 465.07 A: like chicken pox we have to it's required that you get vaccinated for it before you can attend public school 

465.19 468.04 A: and yet there is a stronger strain 

465.73 466.03 B: right 

468.47 471.91 A: that is being passed around the students and they're catching it 

471.98 472.44 B: yes 

472.60 477.37 A: we we've we've defeated for about ten years but it's back 

477.87 480.09 A: and here it is and there's nothing that can 

480.72 481.50 A: that can avoid it 

480.81 483.27 B: the same things happen with the tuberculosis 

483.68 484.62 A: oh that's scary 

484.08 485.55 B: they thought they had it knocked out 

485.70 486.05 A: right 

486.48 489.09 B: now there's a there's a uh strain of it that 

489.20 490.56 B: that they can't knock out 

490.93 491.20 A: yup 

491.15 492.25 B: because it mutated 

492.75 493.36 B: from all these 

493.53 495.00 B: dumb antibiotics 

495.35 497.26 A: i think i'd honestly prefer just to keep her home 

498.67 504.91 A: but well she's my only and she's six so i'm i'm still a little bit protective but i have no problem calling the doctor 

505.11 510.66 A: for advice on a regular basis and i've i've been know to call them in the middle of the night if i was really worried 

510.63 511.08 B: mhm 

511.22 511.62 A: but it 

512.18 513.67 A: to ask them whether or not i should 

514.08 518.25 A: go the extra miles and take her in one of the fevers before a cold was a hundred and three 

518.58 522.77 A: i thought that was horrifying and she said she wouldn't take her own child into the emergency room 

523.13 524.70 A: with a temperature of a hundred and three 

525.03 526.27 A: just to watch her 

526.51 527.79 A: give her a cool bath 

527.96 528.39 B: mhm 

528.10 531.38 A: make sure i give her a stronger tylenol like children's motrin 

532.00 534.37 A: and you know be with her watch for other symptoms 

534.80 535.13 B: yeah 

535.30 537.09 A: even she didn't want me to take her in 

538.31 539.81 A: i thought that was odd but 

540.02 540.67 A: all in all 

540.15 543.43 B: and if you and if you add some rubbing alcohol to the bath water 

543.84 546.34 A: i've heard both that that's a good thing and a bad thing 

546.53 547.95 B: i found it always worked 

548.12 548.61 A: yeah 

548.94 549.45 B: yeah
