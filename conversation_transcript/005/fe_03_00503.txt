255.38 256.02 A: oh yeah 

255.86 260.18 B: [breath] i mean i guess like if we lived in california then it would be 

267.76 279.39 B: every day and the low was only like sixty and honestly i didn't feel depressed at all i was like with my family and all of the shopping was over and i was in dallas i was out of the city and i was just like 

273.18 273.84 A: i know 

278.64 282.46 A: and it was like you didn't mind going outside and it wasn't yup 

280.86 284.90 B: yeah it was so calm and it was so like nice and fresh and 

284.70 285.13 A: yup 

285.31 288.69 B: like you know it was just so suburb-y i don't know 

288.22 294.34 A: i agree and i think you can stay more active and you might be more healthy my mom's moving to florida in may 

290.48 291.35 B: yeah 

293.96 294.92 B: oh really 

294.59 297.34 A: and i'm like i don't know if i could deal with florida but 

296.64 304.32 B: yeah you know because it just gets too humid in the summer it's just too (( hot )) just like dallas yeah i know it's like oh my gosh 

299.46 300.29 A: exactly 

301.86 302.16 A: yup 

303.69 306.45 A: with there's an in between my sister used to live in san diego 

306.30 307.21 B: oh really 

306.95 307.35 A: and 

307.62 309.56 A: they have just beautiful weather 

312.09 312.41 A: yup 

321.54 322.44 A: definitely 

322.27 325.21 B: you know because of the stress in the city and 

337.88 341.32 B: want to stay in and i haven't been nearly as social or 

340.67 341.79 A: true that's true 

341.98 343.40 A: you're absolutely right 

342.06 351.16 B: and it's it's really weird because i thought when i moved here that i would be even more i mean i used to be really social you know when i lived there but when i moved here 

349.52 355.69 A: and plus you're so close to new york you would think oh that's the city that never sleeps everybody is always you know 

351.58 352.46 B: yeah 

353.81 355.00 B: exactly 

355.17 364.06 B: but then when the sun goes down and it's like eight degrees like the last thing i want to do is be outside hanging out you know with people or somewhere or whatever 

357.63 357.93 A: yup 

363.36 367.32 A: exactly and i have a girlfriend who moved to new york and she's experiencing the same thing like 

366.78 367.92 B: really 

367.44 377.03 A: she used to live in arizona and she was like the most outgoing person and so so social like always doing things and she's forcing herself to do that in new york but she's still depressed because 

371.03 371.61 B: yeah 

377.79 378.07 A: yup 

379.80 383.94 B: you know make contact with people go to happy hour different bars 

380.03 382.01 A: go to happy hour yup 

383.70 384.03 A: yup 

384.36 385.44 B: (( )) you know 

384.36 386.31 A: but it still doesn't change 

386.43 389.17 A: she's like (( that's )) what's the most depressing thing it's the 

389.37 393.18 A: hugest city with so many people but you can be so alone 

391.03 391.88 B: yeah 

393.61 395.41 A: and be like surrounded by tons of people 

401.92 402.39 A: yup 

404.79 405.21 A: mm 

410.77 411.08 A: yup 

411.31 413.53 B: here i have like only acquaintances mainly 

413.77 414.04 A: yup 

414.05 424.07 B: you know and it yeah it is surprising and i think that maybe part of living in such a metropolitan area has a lot to do with that with the way i'm reacting 

421.97 423.58 A: yeah definitely i think some 

424.02 426.35 A: i agree and i think that some people just keep to themselves 

426.35 427.02 B: mhm 

426.52 431.66 A: even though it's supposed to be you know so social and so many things going on i think 

429.76 430.79 B: right 

431.92 436.09 A: that sometimes especially on the east coast that the city are a little more 

435.04 435.32 B: and 

440.84 441.74 A: used to that 

442.13 442.64 A: yeah 

442.87 443.22 A: yeah 

443.88 447.91 B: i don't know but i go to college here i'm in my third year and 

448.29 454.71 B: it's i mean i meet people there but it's it's so different from you know when i was at school in dallas and 

451.37 451.88 A: right 

455.14 456.49 B: even in arizona 

456.96 457.77 B: it's just 

457.32 459.85 A: i believe it i believe the weather is also 

460.00 461.59 A: has a lot to do with it too i mean 

461.08 462.58 B: mhm mhm 

462.13 464.93 A: california people everyone's so laid back like 

464.29 465.84 B: that's what i mean i mean it e-

495.44 495.90 A: right 

496.40 501.28 B: but i don- know i mean where you live i guess it's like mainly everybody drives right
