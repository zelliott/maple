41.58 43.84 A: you know that certainly doesn't compare to invading them 

47.56 48.13 B: uh 

48.50 49.54 B: i i don- 

50.57 53.06 B: i don't know my opinion on war is uh 

54.47 56.20 B: i don't like the whole idea of it heh 

56.83 60.00 B: but i i guess the militarily there's 

60.13 61.07 B: they find some 

61.49 62.07 B: need 

62.37 63.02 B: and 

64.18 64.56 B: i don't 

66.45 67.15 B: i don't know 

69.50 76.78 A: well of course there i think it comes down to whether he has or doesn't have these um uh weapons of mass destruction and whether they think 

77.42 79.29 A: uh they're going to use them or not 

79.89 80.43 A: uh 

81.48 86.12 A: that supposedly is the reason uh to go in there i'm sure oil has something to do with it too 

88.80 89.66 A: and uh 

90.52 95.26 A: you know if his father had finished the job out originally uh they wouldn't have to go back in there again 

95.76 99.03 A: could have done it rel- relatively easy with all the men he had on the ground 

100.22 100.69 A: but he 

101.52 106.00 A: he let -em get away and now they're coming back years afterwards to do the same thing over again 

110.50 111.69 B: so tha- um 

113.78 117.19 B: we still don't know if they have arms uh i mean uh 

117.65 120.30 B: arms of mass destruction we still didn't find out 

120.96 121.84 A: well uh 

122.43 128.05 A: the u._n. inspectors have got some evidence but it's not overwhelming 

128.72 132.25 A: i suspect that we know things that we haven't told them yet 

132.98 135.32 A: uh through spy satellites and 

136.07 138.64 A: maybe we pay people to get intelligence 

139.06 139.82 A: uh 

140.23 142.57 A: bush certainly thinks they have it that's for sure 

143.26 146.27 A: uh certainly uh biological weapons 

146.65 149.11 A: i'm not sure they have an atomic bomb but uh 

150.69 154.46 A: uh they certainly sh- shown some inclination to use it against their own people 

155.67 156.14 A: (( death )) 

156.59 158.66 A: there're other countries in the world that uh 

159.08 159.87 A: probably 

159.98 165.30 A: pose as much as a threat to us as as -s -s i would think iraq an- like north korea or iran 

166.40 167.26 A: somehow he's 

167.65 169.29 A: fixated on this one country 

169.51 170.08 B: oh 

171.81 173.15 B: well i guess if there's a 

173.62 174.18 B: um 

176.46 177.29 B: a threat 

177.82 178.15 B: that 

178.46 180.45 B: i guess our government has the 

181.10 182.96 B: the obligation to uh 

184.80 185.59 B: to uh 

186.13 187.35 B: eliminate that threat 

188.55 197.71 A: well as i said i'm -m not sure the american people completely know what this threat is or certainly the europeans don't think it's as much of a threat 

198.01 201.72 A: as much as bush does certainly france and germany don't 

202.85 209.07 A: they're not going to apparently support us despite the fact that uh we've been their allies over a long time period 

211.51 215.74 A: uh there's obviously things that bush has not told us that uh 

216.04 217.02 A: maybe would uh 

218.70 221.30 A: make us more enthused uh you know to get rid of him 

223.04 225.19 A: he certainly a bad person but uh 

226.47 227.10 A: uh 

227.78 234.61 A: you know m- my concern is i i have no problem with us going in and i'm sure we'll easily defeat them 

235.13 237.26 A: but what do we do with the country afterwards 

239.08 240.12 B: oh good question 

240.57 242.82 A: you know and when we took over for example from 

243.23 244.06 A: in germany 

244.68 247.38 A: the people were reasonably united or japan 

247.90 249.86 A: here you have a lot of different groups 

250.44 251.05 A: and 

251.43 256.35 A: it's not a country you know look what happened with yugoslavia when all these groups is 

256.65 259.76 A: were uh separated and uh we came in 

260.21 262.63 A: which made it very difficult to make a country out of it 

263.50 266.20 A: uh we could be there for y- for decades 

267.62 269.44 B: and that would cost us a lot of money an- 

269.57 270.55 A: the billions 

269.78 270.57 B: man power 

270.78 275.51 A: billions ah because these people have absolutely no sense of democracy 

277.12 279.12 A: an- if we try to introduce it to them 

279.94 282.72 A: uh i'm not sure you know what their uh 

283.05 284.99 A: their feelings are (( gonna )) be towards it 

285.30 289.04 A: and we have no guarantee if we go in there that we'll even catch saddam i mean 

289.41 290.29 A: we've been trying to 

290.76 293.19 A: to catch the al qaeda people for a long time 

293.77 298.14 A: and we've offered tremendous rewards and we still haven't got bin laden for example 

299.66 302.00 A: so saddam could very easily slip out of the country 

303.35 305.91 A: he's g- from what i understand he's got a whole bunch of doubles 

307.11 307.58 B: really 

307.12 307.60 A: (( and then he )) 

307.87 309.81 A: that uh go around and uh 

310.20 313.10 A: i'm sure he's got plenty of money stashed away over seas 

313.82 316.94 A: so he could very easily disappear before we take the country over 

317.67 318.88 A: might not catch him at all 

320.98 323.18 B: seems like a catch twenty two here 

327.67 332.24 A: because i don't as i said i feel he's not showing us everything i assume he has a lot more 

334.50 337.01 A: but i don't think people have given enough cre- ah 

337.51 338.79 A: uh thought to uh 

339.50 340.47 A: what uh 

341.11 345.06 A: the consequences of going in there are going to be what we do with the country after we've won it 

348.57 348.94 B: hm 

349.46 350.15 A: -cause uh 

350.53 355.80 A: this could you know we we have bad relations with moslem countries now and this this could make it even worse 

359.53 362.04 A: it may destabilize uh some of these countries 

363.68 367.35 A: we start you know attacking him uh unless we can really prove 

369.05 371.84 A: that he's as bad as uh apparently bush thinks he is 

372.41 373.18 A: you could have uh 

373.45 380.99 A: you know a lot of these countries uh in the middle east like saudi arabia yet people could revolt and throw out uh the governments they have now 

384.30 387.34 A: so i would like to see a little more proof anyway that's just my personal opinion 

387.79 389.35 B: you'd like to see what more proof 

389.33 397.07 A: (( now )) i'd like to see m- i- like to understand w- what he he thinks he has and what proof he has i guess in some way he doesn't want to uh 

397.50 399.27 A: compromise his intelligence 

400.63 401.42 A: but uh 

402.34 404.89 A: he certainly hasn't proved it to the french or the uh 

405.33 406.02 A: the english 

406.21 413.94 A: uh i'm assuming the french or the germans uh they don't seem to be following us very much and i assume we may (( even )) well go if we go in there and 

414.24 417.00 A: it appears that we're going in in about a month or so 

417.80 421.34 A: uh i assume we may very well do it without the u._n. supporting us 

422.35 428.96 A: because uh france and uh germany or maybe some other countries uh will vote against us 

431.19 432.91 A: or at least vote against (( throwing )) in there 

434.56 437.08 A: certainly -f we had the u._n. behind us -t would make our uh 

438.14 439.43 A: our morality stronger 

440.68 442.49 A: rather than acting unilaterally 

444.59 445.23 A: -cause uh 

445.48 449.17 A: at least the polls i've seen the american people are kind of equivocal about this 

450.98 455.06 A: they support bush but they don't support the war quite as strongly as they support bush 

458.09 458.61 B: so 

459.56 463.15 B: war is the only way to try to eliminate the 

463.77 466.28 B: the wars of ma- i mean the um 

467.64 468.30 B: eh uh 

468.62 470.43 B: weapons of mass destruction 

470.67 472.52 B: there's no way of f- finding 

473.05 476.90 A: well he's got -em hidden i'm sure he's got -em uh in fact there's even some 

473.41 474.08 B: the weapons 

477.16 480.43 A: thought that he might have some of those weapons outside his country 

481.13 483.51 A: like he he brought the airplanes to iran 

484.22 485.54 A: when we hit him the first time 

487.33 489.02 A: and it's possible uh 

489.39 490.06 A: you know uh 

490.32 501.22 A: certainly if we could go in there and put one bomb down and kill him maybe that would be enough and save the war but uh we would have a lot of trouble locating time problems locating him 

504.81 506.72 B: i think it's just going to irritate them 

507.58 509.21 B: you know 

509.35 512.33 A: well is to a certain gonna is- irritates eh the the uh 

512.51 514.96 A: the moslem uh extremists that's for sure 

515.99 519.39 B: i mean it's just going to get worse and you know i feel that it's just going to be 

520.59 525.41 B: more terrorism building more weapons the ones they didn't find and 

525.59 526.09 B: you know 

526.66 527.73 B: building up uh 

529.74 533.16 B: uh arsenal or whatever you want to call it an- just 

533.77 534.71 B: when we're not looking 

536.01 536.52 B: you know 

536.80 540.14 B: come back at us i mean unless they need us for some reason 

541.36 542.64 B: they need us 

543.13 547.10 A: well they need us in kuwait and yet the they certainly needed us when uh
