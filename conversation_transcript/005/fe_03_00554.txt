5.17 5.98 A: hi richard 

5.81 6.32 B: hi 

6.52 8.13 A: this is like the weirdest thing 

8.61 9.04 B: abs- 

8.68 10.18 A: ha- have you ever done this before 

9.79 12.13 B: i have never done this this is my very first call 

12.12 18.27 A: okay mine too so we should get along great so i guess we're just suppose to talk about like reality shows 

14.69 14.97 B: yup 

17.95 22.66 B: reality shows which i wouldn't be caught dead watching in the first place 

22.35 23.63 A: uh really 

23.74 28.50 B: i have some interesting crack potty theories on why they're so popular and i'm sure you do too 

28.85 34.86 A: see i actually watch them i watch them so go ahead tell me your theory why people watch them 

34.81 38.83 B: oh i think everybody wants to uh to vicariously live a fantasy 

40.09 40.69 A: okay 

40.38 41.00 B: uh 

41.25 43.89 B: basically uh they they they put them 

44.11 45.24 B: selves in the uh 

46.15 47.03 B: in the positions of 

47.21 49.22 B: one of their favorite characters and just live that 

50.35 51.13 A: okay so 

51.31 53.75 A: now why why don't you watch them why don't you like them 

54.54 55.25 B: ah 

55.93 57.66 B: i ah i tend to to look 

57.93 59.09 B: to ah to watch 

59.22 63.56 B: stuff that's a little bit more meaty a little more intellectual i watch p._b._s. a lot 

63.96 64.93 B: yep that sort of thing 

65.47 67.17 B: i'm not attracted to the network fair 

67.62 69.32 A: real see my theory on this is 

69.51 70.58 A: it all started with 

70.71 71.38 A: m._t._v. 

72.04 72.35 B: yeah 

72.38 77.14 A: m._t._v. is where all of the reality based t._v. shows came from because it started off with the real world 

77.56 82.31 A: and then as soon as the real world got popular everybody and their mother started doing 

82.53 83.96 A: reality based t._v. shows 

84.52 92.08 A: i really i don- i don't watch survivor i don't watch the mole or whatever those stupid shows are i usually stick with the ones on m._t._v. 

92.20 95.16 A: because i do like those i watch um the real world 

95.44 99.45 A: and i think you might be right about your theory that people want to be 

99.94 101.75 A: that they live vicariously through 

102.16 103.26 A: those people 

103.64 106.39 A: because i think it would be cool i i don't know if you watch the real world 

106.85 111.08 A: but it's they give a group of (( )) and they're always young people that's what pisses me off 

111.56 112.94 A: they don't do it with older people 

113.44 116.81 A: you know but like you can only be like twenty three years old and then they 

116.43 121.28 B: well that that might be part of it see here i am at uh at the ripe old age of sixty 

121.94 126.35 B: and uh i certainly can't identify with any of these uh these kids that are on t._v. 

126.57 137.99 A: you see i can i'm still at that age where i can still identify with them and like right now that the real world is in las vegas they've got them up in a penthouse sweet in some hotel and they give them jobs 

138.83 141.37 A: you know like really cool jobs promoting clubs 

141.81 144.65 A: i mean you know who wouldn't want to be who wouldn't want to do that 

146.34 147.13 A: you know 

147.29 150.44 A: i mean i would love to do that if somebody came up to me and said 

150.62 151.22 A: hey kat 

151.86 158.26 A: we're going to pay you to live in a penthouse in vegas and promote a club and you get everything for free 

158.59 159.71 A: and you get paid for it 

160.48 160.83 B: right 

160.59 163.87 A: i mean you're going to be like a total idiot and say um no i don't think i want to do that 

164.16 167.70 B: it's almost like uh turning this down the uh chance to talk on the telephone 

167.96 168.64 A: yeah 

168.27 169.28 B: for pay (( right )) 

169.26 171.81 A: well i talk a lot so this is like a cool thing for me 

171.02 171.28 B: right 

172.10 174.36 A: it's easier to talk than chat and then type 

174.68 175.02 A: so 

174.82 175.09 B: right 

175.58 180.65 A: so but i i you know i understand that s- some people don't like those kind of shows 

181.75 182.36 A: but i do 

182.95 183.22 B: good 

183.07 184.72 A: b- but only certain ones 

184.88 188.91 A: so (( i mean )) som- i think they've gone overboard with a lot of the stuff 

189.96 190.56 A: i mean 

190.28 192.89 B: well yeah some of it does get a little extreme from what i've seen 

192.96 195.57 A: eh eh i mean you know like the big race 

196.43 200.33 A: i've never seen that but it's stupid they drop people off in a remote part of nowhere 

201.44 204.62 A: and you have no money no nothing and you're suppose to get back to 

204.04 205.78 B: and they're suppose to get back to civilization 

205.71 210.38 A: yeah hello i just i just find that ridiculous 

207.45 207.73 B: yeah 

211.28 212.46 A: and survivor 

213.31 214.56 A: i've watched a couple times 

214.83 217.15 A: it'd be cool for some reason i'm overweight like 

217.48 218.21 A: sixty pounds 

218.58 221.99 A: i think that would be cool drop me off on this island and let me lose weight 

222.13 225.95 A: works for me then you woul- 

222.47 223.76 B: that's right (( )) 

225.20 228.39 B: sure you can only go so far on uh roots and nuts 

228.18 233.39 A: uh i know i mean but you know if you got extra weight you can you know afford to be on an island like that 

234.67 238.08 A: so um w- you don't do you know how this works at all 

238.47 240.00 B: i have no idea 

239.66 239.99 A: i don't 

240.10 240.43 A: (( eh )) 

240.10 245.71 B: i just said you know i i i'm basically an unemployed software engineer at this point i have lots of time on my hands 

246.35 250.29 B: and i said oh why not why not get uh whatever we're getting per call 

251.47 253.87 A: okay so how do we know when the calls over or 

253.81 258.48 B: i really don't know i think it's suppose to go for about ten minutes and we may hear a beep 

258.39 263.23 A: is it i don't know i i mean i signed up for this thing and i guess i didn't really read it too well 

263.65 265.32 A: but i mean i thought it was like a cool thing 

264.71 266.01 B: get in line take a number 

266.20 267.60 B: neither did i 

267.38 270.47 A: well i'm on like every survey sight imaginable 

270.63 270.96 B: yeah 

271.01 278.15 A: because i like taking surveys and then they pop this little thing up to me and i'm like yeah i like to talk on the phone i can talk about anything i'm a bartender 

278.81 279.10 B: oh 

278.92 282.73 A: so so i can talk about everything and anything 

283.15 286.54 A: so i figured why not make money while talking hey works for me 

286.37 294.69 B: well that's that's the fundamental difference between uh men and women uh women basically run their mou- mouths constantly while i basically will say 

294.81 296.18 B: yeah sure yes 

296.30 297.38 A: um uh-huh 

296.44 297.73 B: yeah uh-huh uh-huh 

298.00 298.77 B: yeah really 

299.10 303.13 A: that's how most men are they're just monosyl- monosyllabic 

300.45 300.74 B: yeah 

301.91 303.43 B: i can't believe 

303.56 305.77 B: the amount of time my my wife spends on the phone 

306.80 308.70 A: well my brother's girlfriend 

309.26 310.28 A: she's from ecuador 

311.15 314.25 A: and i have never seen anyone talk on the phone as much as she does 

314.54 316.66 A: she was on the phone for six hours one day 

317.72 319.95 A: hello there's a reality show right there 

320.10 320.89 B: absolutely 

320.89 325.17 A: talking on the phone for six hours how could you i mean i can talk a lot 

325.77 328.65 A: but i can't see talking to the same person for six hours straight 

329.18 329.92 B: yeah well (( )) 

330.07 331.43 A: i mean what do you have to talk about 

331.65 333.93 A: after the first hour you're basically done 

334.48 338.18 A: with everything you have to say i couldn't think of five hours worth of stuff to come up with 

338.52 339.20 A: after that 

340.98 342.92 A: so it's just amazing to me 

344.38 346.83 A: so i don't know but this i thought this was a cool idea 

346.93 347.58 B: yeah it it 

347.56 348.10 A: (( )) 

347.72 352.98 B: i i think what they're trying to do is they're trying to analyze speech patterns they're trying to figure out uh 

353.64 354.69 B: uh how 

355.32 358.67 B: perfect strangers wind up talking to one another and and feel comfortable about it 

359.17 359.67 A: well (( )) 

360.23 362.19 A: i guess that's kind of like a reality show 

362.22 362.50 B: yeah 

362.63 363.29 B: absolutely 

363.24 367.20 A: it's a re- reality telephone there we go we could start a new thing 

367.76 368.93 A: we could become rich 

369.71 372.07 A: hey you're the software guy figure this out 

372.22 372.56 B: right 

372.84 374.53 A: we could do reality telephone 

377.38 381.52 B: well unfortunately i think it's uh gotten to that with telemarketers 

382.08 382.62 A: uh 

383.32 383.84 A: i know 

384.00 384.52 A: (( i know )) 

384.78 387.03 A: i know i get calls from them constantly 

387.69 391.41 A: and my thing that pisses me off now is if you don't answer your phone on the first ring 

392.04 393.70 A: when you pick up the phone they're your like 

393.89 394.66 A: hello 

394.76 396.67 A: hello hell and there's nobody there
