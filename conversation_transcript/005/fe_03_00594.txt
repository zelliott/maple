53.38 53.78 A: mhm

79.49 81.01 B: right exactly

153.19 158.45 A: well excuse me it's not my anniversary it's what i call our half anniversary since we're still newlyweds i guess that is why we 

158.47 160.11 B: you're newlyweds oh that is cool 

158.77 159.05 A: so 

159.93 165.22 A: so that is why we still pay attention to the months 

164.26 165.53 B: yeah 

165.97 166.49 A: um 

167.11 169.24 A: yeah i think every holiday is pretty much 

169.42 170.74 A: pretty much covered whether it's 

170.92 177.79 A: money family food parties drinking all that stuff um 

175.13 175.58 B: yeah 

178.83 186.07 A: i yeah i've if you've created another one you'd probably get a lot of people sore at you because yeah 

184.32 187.68 B: another holiday yeah 

186.22 192.21 A: yeah they'd go what another holiday that that either everybody gets off or nobody gets off of work 

191.23 194.85 B: or everyone has to fy- buy presents for someone yeah 

194.97 195.38 B: yeah 

198.34 199.05 A: presents 

198.77 200.28 B: yeah yeah 

207.85 209.38 B: exactly you know and it 

208.68 212.50 A: just don't do it i mean you know try and avoid those people 

211.26 214.49 B: there is nothing that says that you have to i mean you know 

214.11 214.60 A: yeah 

214.91 225.87 B: and we you know i've i'm try to instill in my children that that is not what it's all about and you know we have four children and we allow them to ask for three things and three things only and 

226.19 228.22 B: usually they get more than that but 

228.02 228.81 A: yeah 

228.83 231.25 B: that is what they're allowed to ask for and they understand that 

231.63 232.92 A: now that is a good idea 

231.69 233.65 B: and they understand why so 

233.96 234.50 B: you know 

235.19 237.75 A: that is a good idea i think i'll when we have kids i'll 

237.92 240.63 A: have something like that it's a good idea 

240.85 243.21 A: cause uh i was pretty greedy i guess as a kid 

243.41 247.82 A: i mean greedy in that i'd look in the magazines and say i want this and this and this and this 

246.69 248.09 B: yeah well so was i 

248.75 253.40 B: you know and um you know i don't think um i don't think my par- my parents ever taught me 

254.62 256.87 B: that um you know that we shouldn't be that way that 

257.37 257.86 B: you know 

258.62 261.01 B: they taught me the true meaning of christmas of course but not 

261.27 261.83 B: you know 

263.60 264.04 A: yeah 

263.61 266.33 B: there were no guidelines to it 

265.21 266.33 A: yeah that is true it 

266.63 271.13 A: and with my father making it so much fun it sort of was like well isn't that 

271.40 277.70 A: what i'm supposed to do and so i kind of thought i was supposed to you know buy lots of presents and supposed to get lots of presents 

275.31 276.33 B: right 

276.67 277.36 B: right 

277.82 285.03 A: so that is just how it is but uh i imagine uh my husband will temper it down a little bit enough that i don't get carried away but that 

285.25 290.62 A: we can he doesn't get carried away with his scrooginess hopefully 

288.38 291.94 B: yeah you you'll find a happy medium 

291.66 298.11 A: yeah that'll be good oh goodness wasn't sure if i knew how long these calls are supposed to last or not 

292.88 293.64 B: yeah 

296.85 301.12 B: i was going to ask you how long are are you supposed to tal- how long are we supposed to talk about this 

298.27 299.19 A: yeah 

301.15 307.82 A: they never said i don't think ever before so i thought well maybe they'll just suddenly cut us off which is kind of rude 

306.36 308.71 B: this is my first call these 

308.01 309.92 A: yeah this is my very first call too 

309.54 310.95 B: okay so i 

310.32 311.37 A: yes 

311.08 312.06 B: i don't know 

311.92 323.75 A: we're both in it together yeah i i know they said keep talking about it but i didn't know you know if we were going to be cut off or ten minutes or what that is but this is that is only an interesting uh forum to 

323.86 325.30 A: get there research done 

324.89 325.47 B: it is 

325.65 327.34 B: it is i i think i like the 

325.86 326.27 A: yeah 

327.58 328.12 B: uh 

330.05 331.72 B: the way this is being done you know 

331.91 332.44 A: mhm 

332.75 333.73 B: as opposed to 

334.73 335.47 B: either being 

334.88 336.13 A: pen and paper 

335.58 335.93 B: asked 

336.20 337.34 B: questions by 

337.82 343.15 B: someone that is just reading from a piece of paper or you know going on line and 

342.17 342.67 A: mhm 

344.02 345.12 B: clicking 

344.89 347.64 A: yeah yeah and i'd do that too but this 

345.56 345.85 B: (( )) 

346.09 346.35 B: it's 

346.60 348.83 B: i'd do it but it gets boring i mean you know 

348.64 355.19 A: yeah this is the kind of thing and since it is interactive you feed off of each other even if you have very different opinions you'd feed off each other 

355.25 355.78 B: right 

355.92 358.57 A: and keep it going kind of um 

356.15 356.51 B: right 

359.75 369.13 A: i don't know maybe we are only supposed to talk until we think we've run out of ideas i guess it can't hurt to just stop but um
