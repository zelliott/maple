138.50 140.25 B: i don't think they realize what they're doing but

143.73 145.51 A: they really 

145.25 147.50 B: think we're getting off the subject 

147.08 152.31 A: oh well i you know i think they probably expect us too you know 

150.57 151.31 B: oh really 

152.19 153.94 B: i've never done one of these before so 

153.78 163.24 A: i've not done one of these i've done focus groups and they kind of wander all over the place so and and they seem to be okay with that so i'm not sure but i yeah i think 

158.52 159.03 B: oh really 

163.52 166.92 A: mom's day off would be a good day i don't know how we 

167.24 168.69 A: pull it off but 

168.42 170.29 B: i don't neither i don't think they can live without us 

170.69 172.46 A: i don't think they can either 

171.83 172.80 B: or function without us 

172.57 173.08 A: i mean 

173.35 177.13 A: you take one day off and the house goes to hell in a hand basket 

176.27 177.48 B: right 

177.59 181.57 A: yeah yeah laundry is piled higher than your head 

178.23 178.76 B: yeah 

182.16 183.71 B: hey maybe that is another one um 

183.90 184.89 B: kids do laundry day 

185.34 187.07 B: if they know how 

188.26 190.35 B: we we'd probably come out with all pink clothes huh 

190.13 194.01 A: i was going to say it'd take you a week to deal with the mistakes they made 

194.82 197.12 A: i saw a joke on the net today 

197.52 199.88 A: husband was doing laundry and he 

200.32 202.22 A: called out to his wife and said 

203.70 210.06 A: what setting do i use in the washer said and she says what does it say on your sweat shirt and he says greenbay packers 

210.81 218.51 A: you know it's one of those i thought blondes were supposed to be dumb jokes 

212.66 213.72 B: that sounds like a man 

215.77 221.10 B: i thin- you know i think men play like that sometimes so that we'll have to do the work 

220.75 222.76 A: oh yeah yeah 

223.12 227.20 A: but uh yeah i i don't know i don't know what kind of 

227.32 230.56 A: holiday i would have i i think the 

230.33 230.76 B: tough one 

231.06 236.67 A: the clean up after the holiday would be so nasty that it probably wouldn't be worth the 

237.19 238.86 A: the day off yeah 

240.31 240.71 B: well 

243.25 249.43 A: i don't think so that is that is kind of like you know once you have kids you lose your name you lose your identity 

249.46 250.20 B: and you go crazy 

250.37 251.23 B: and get the gray hairs 

250.47 256.75 A: you go crazy you lose your sanity and you lose all days off until they're at least fifty 

252.77 253.13 B: right 

257.32 257.60 B: true 

258.01 258.37 A: yeah 

258.62 259.05 A: yeah 

259.47 260.63 A: at least fifty 

261.22 261.99 B: not eighteen 

262.14 263.15 B: like everybody thinks 

263.01 263.85 A: oh no 

264.19 270.22 A: no no at eighteen their circle of friends widens because they're mobile and they bring more of them home 

270.07 271.20 B: right 

271.65 273.55 A: trust me been there done that 

272.20 275.23 B: and then they venture out and then they want to come back when they're thirty five 

275.86 280.90 A: yeah you know that is the thing is you've got to make home a little less inviting i think 

275.97 276.28 B: yeah 

281.77 283.54 B: how do you go about doing that 

281.98 283.84 A: you know 

284.11 287.76 A: so that elastic umbilical cord doesn't keep snapping back

408.06 409.88 A: uh twenty five would be a heat wave here 

410.19 410.52 B: wow 

411.27 412.57 B: i think i'll stay down south 

413.98 415.13 B: maybe further south

416.72 418.39 B: i know a couple years ago we got um

423.02 426.30 A: oh my god and you had the kids home for a week 

427.52 430.02 A: that is not my idea of a holiday 

431.13 432.81 A: oh man 

432.01 434.80 B: and then we had that big ice storm last month and um 

435.78 439.52 B: that knocked down trees and power lines people were without power for like a week 

439.89 447.17 A: that is one thing about here they're pretty good about it we don't lose power very often every once in a great long while but not often 

447.24 450.50 B: i'm a new sub-division so um i was the only one out for like a 

451.07 452.12 B: eight hours so 

453.52 454.57 A: that is not bad that is 

455.05 459.28 A: this town this is uh a very old town it's a real small area 

460.35 461.16 A: and um 

462.67 463.10 A: they 

463.63 466.70 A: but they are really well equipped for 

466.96 470.35 A: snow emergencies and ice storms and that kind of thing 

470.61 471.21 B: not here 

470.95 471.44 A: odd 

476.42 476.80 B: what

484.80 485.12 B: uh-huh 

486.32 489.48 A: i mean they just and and the other part of that is it's this 

489.85 492.16 A: whole town is built on a huge hill 

493.13 494.65 A: so it's yeah 

494.88 501.37 A: it's kind of a mess when it when it gets icy snow is not too bad but ice is just a mess so they jump right on it 

501.04 502.22 B: lay off the roads huh 

502.60 503.27 A: oh yeah 

503.39 506.20 A: yeah you can slide all the way from your house to work 

507.88 510.23 A: sideways as a matter of fact 

512.00 512.90 A: but uh 

513.29 519.03 A: yeah it's it's kind of interesting when it when we get an ice storm here but yeah you guys aren't really 

519.21 521.36 A: equipped to take care of that kind of thing are you 

522.06 525.73 B: well they have the d. o. t. trucks too that go out and spread sand but um 

526.97 529.55 B: not many of them cause we don't you know like i say we don't get that much 

529.71 530.63 B: snow normally 

531.72 537.01 A: yeah yeah see here we've got county trucks we've got state trucks and we've got city trucks as well that 

537.14 538.03 A: that come and 

538.22 539.68 A: and get all the side streets 

538.92 539.98 B: we just have the state 

540.85 543.09 A: so it it really is not bad at all 

544.68 545.02 A: yeah 

545.15 548.20 B: but if you ever come down south north carolina and it snows 

548.48 551.21 B: don't go on the roads cause people here do not know how to drive and 

551.32 552.51 A: oh i bet 

552.69 555.68 A: i went to college in birmingham alabama and 

555.15 555.54 B: uh-huh 

556.36 558.50 A: i've got to tell you one time 

558.83 559.56 A: we got like 

560.28 562.24 A: maybe a half of an inch 

563.64 565.06 A: and the whole town shut down
