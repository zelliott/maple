17.44 21.05 B: well i think it's high time that we took care of mister saddam 

21.24 23.30 A: l- i think so too 

23.50 27.45 B: i'm greatly concerned about the use of biological and chemical weapons 

28.18 28.57 B: and 

28.66 35.50 B: i can not see how everything that was there can disappear in a matter of a few years and no accountability 

35.89 37.06 A: well 

37.61 40.50 A: i i think it's time he just took care of his debts 

41.45 46.02 A: mistake i guess i don't want to say mistake but i mean he needs 

45.54 46.67 B: w- uh act (( )) 

46.79 48.05 B: a hundred percent 

47.96 49.69 A: you know he he 

49.92 54.76 A: he needs to take care of what his dad left undone and uh and i mean 

55.91 58.38 A: the trade center gave us a wonderful reason 

58.62 59.41 A: to do that 

70.39 73.38 A: it's never been yeah okay come on in and see what we've got 

73.46 75.86 A: um yet it is with over countries 

76.56 86.99 A: and um they always continually give us a hard time well it's a time to say okay no more they've done enough with their you know on september eleventh that was enough that was a wake up call 

87.52 88.89 A: they showed us what they can do 

90.02 91.78 A: and now it's time to finish it 

91.84 93.66 B: i agree completely 

93.79 96.13 B: the the problem that i had is i 

96.53 98.49 B: hurdle with you i think originally 

98.89 103.69 B: we should have finished it while we had all of our resources and personnel there during the gulf war 

103.68 104.20 A: right 

104.28 107.92 B: and therefore we wouldn't have the additional expense of of 

108.04 110.10 B: quote quote redoing it now 

109.48 111.87 A: doing it all over again that's exactly right 

111.76 120.12 B: and i i speak this first hand because my son in law was in the military at that time and they had everything over there and everything was prepared 

120.98 121.27 A: yeah 

121.08 125.19 B: and and it was politics that basically kept them from doing it and they should have done it 

125.46 127.73 A: it they they they really should have 

127.83 132.84 A: no matter what they had to do no matter how covert the operation had to be it should have been done 

132.98 136.14 B: i agree and i also feel that 

138.06 138.94 B: as long 

139.06 142.29 B: as he is in any power whatsoever 

142.84 151.75 B: there is going to be a continual threat and it's been proven that he believes in genocide and let uh eliminating various races like what he's done with the kurds 
152.66 157.73 B: and i really don't see how we could send troops in to to other countries to 

157.88 164.64 B: quote quote help peace keeping and feed people and remember we've got a a man there that is is exterminating 

164.86 165.53 B: other people 

166.72 167.10 A: yeah 

167.82 169.47 A: what are and he literally doesn't care 

169.86 172.93 A: who gets killed in the process his own or or us 

173.18 177.15 B: oh i think that is quite clear he uh killed his own uh son in law 

177.42 177.83 A: yeah 

178.41 185.70 A: i mean he has absolutely no regard for human life and he has no regard for for um 

186.12 187.61 A: his o- his own people 

196.71 197.18 A: them 

197.57 199.74 A: when their sons die with with money 

200.53 204.65 A: he rewards the parents and and the parents are quite happy about it 

204.16 206.31 B: and you know i think that's one of the problems 

206.47 207.32 B: that that is 

207.62 208.35 B: uh 

209.11 209.64 B: i guess 

209.77 213.18 B: a problem in the muslim world where they reward terrorism 

213.82 214.24 B: and 

214.64 215.58 B: what (( are )) 

215.85 216.35 B: see 

216.58 222.24 B: happening is once we do take action i see him attempting to involve israel 

222.78 223.31 A: mhm 

223.13 229.58 B: and attacking israel with the (( )) missiles with chemical warheads like he did during the gulf war this time with real chemicals 

228.60 228.92 A: yup 

230.88 239.44 B: and and i really thing that's what he's going to try to do and i think that's what he planned all along and if his weapons aren't there in front of him he's moved them to a neighboring country 

239.79 243.96 A: yup and and i j- i just hope this bush doesn't make the same mistake as the last one did 

244.97 246.27 B: well i agree i 

245.01 245.34 A: you know 

246.39 249.01 B: i think that that was a terrible waste of money 

246.48 247.39 A: i just hope he 

249.28 253.78 A: yup it you know what it's it's a terrible waste of money and a waste of life 

253.93 256.74 B: well it is but you know look at what uh 

256.96 259.93 B: you know norman storman norman wanted to go all the way then 

260.07 261.01 A: mhm yup 

266.55 267.23 B: do that 

267.64 270.55 B: because they were concerned about destabilizing the region 

271.05 275.46 B: and you know how you can destabilize something that is very unstable 

275.08 279.86 A: um yeah yeah exactly exactly 

278.91 281.51 B: it it made no sense whatsoever 

281.97 284.27 A: no they they should have listened to him then 

282.46 282.90 B: and uh 

284.37 288.44 B: i think and as long as as that continues there's going to be a 

288.62 291.33 B: what i would say would be a culture 

291.49 294.17 B: uh breeding area for terrorists 

294.62 294.93 A: yeah 

295.17 300.85 B: and i think that's going to continue and i think it's proven if not directly indirectly through financial aid 

295.29 295.55 A: yup 

302.22 303.25 A: if through what i'm sorry 

303.38 304.42 B: financial aid 

304.45 305.00 A: yes 

304.94 306.49 B: because he has been giving 

306.70 309.94 B: from what i understand the money to the uh 

310.12 312.28 B: bombers in israel to their families 

312.11 313.14 A: oh absolutely 

312.81 315.82 B: not only in his own country but even in other countries 

315.79 316.91 A: mhm 

316.52 316.95 B: i think 

317.05 320.27 B: i read somewhere it was ten thousand dollars or something like that 

321.58 322.00 A: yeah i- 

322.33 324.10 A: i i saw it on i saw it on the news 

325.13 327.99 A: where where this mother was getting rewarded with a with a check 

328.74 331.91 A: and they showed the check right there and i mean oh my gosh 

333.14 334.58 A: my gosh i think it i think 

334.86 337.03 A: uh i think the american parents would 

337.31 339.96 A: certainly handle it a lot differently 

339.71 341.67 B: well i think so and and uh 

342.18 342.89 B: you know 

343.25 343.79 B: if if 

353.07 357.86 B: and we've not had any type of resolution if anything is continued and deteriorated 

358.31 359.75 B: and i just think enough is enough 

360.99 363.25 A: i i totally and completely agree with you 

363.48 371.14 B: i was joking with someone the other day and said well we ought to invade the country and take it over and make it a safety first state and then we would have all the oil we need 

371.26 373.86 A: that would work 

373.60 384.24 B: course that was a joke but i mean you have to think about it for a minute because that's always been the average with the uh arab world controlling the oil against the united states 

381.68 382.01 A: yup 

384.15 386.43 A: and you know and and not only us 

387.10 387.88 A: not only us 

387.30 388.79 B: oh england look at england 

388.70 389.86 A: exactly 

389.67 390.75 B: and and uh 

390.49 391.21 A: and canada 

391.25 393.99 B: exactly and the only reason that i think that france 

393.29 396.80 A: so if it was the fifty first state that would that would that would work 
396.73 397.79 B: that's right 

397.09 400.05 A: that would work for everybody because i i know that 

398.28 398.86 B: yeah 

399.28 401.41 B: and and they would get good health care 

401.60 402.20 A: yeah 

402.77 403.65 A: you know 

403.02 405.14 B: and and the other problem that i had is 

405.77 406.34 B: you know 

406.71 409.54 A: we i don't want to leave this for my kids to clean up you know 

406.79 407.11 B: the 

408.91 415.46 B: well that's exactly right you know to me this like we said earlier this should have been taken care of nine years ago 

414.57 414.88 A: yup 

415.57 415.96 A: and y- 

416.28 420.03 A: and and and i've got i've got a son that's twenty eight and i've got 

420.85 423.34 A: a son that's also um nine 

423.82 424.99 A: and one ten and 

425.36 427.47 A: i don't want my nine and ten year old to clean it up 

427.80 435.62 B: no and and i don't want them to live in a world of fear and i think that as long as someone like him remains in power 

431.57 431.88 A: no 

435.80 436.70 A: mhm 

436.75 442.69 B: it you know it's got to be done and and if you think back about our track history look at what we did with norwiego 

443.35 445.90 B: you know he was just a drug dealer and we took him out 

445.88 447.00 A: a- absolutely 

447.02 449.55 B: i mean you can't even compare him to saddam hussein 

449.62 450.15 A: mhm 

450.30 455.60 B: and and i think that you know it's time to quit playing politics just tell the other countries that we are going to do it 

455.90 459.79 B: let's get it over with if you're with us you're with us if you're against us you're against us 

460.01 461.73 A: and we've never had so much support 

461.81 467.70 B: exactly and and if france don't want to do it that's fine i can understand france's financial reasonings 

468.24 470.45 B: you know they are scared they are going to lose their little oil 

468.49 468.79 A: mhm 

471.34 471.60 A: yup 

472.17 473.81 B: and uh that's the bottom line with them 

474.09 476.52 A: yeah i don't i don't know much about that situation the 

476.27 488.07 B: well they they had it on t._v. that that uh right now that france has people in that country and and the oil that's being exported france is buying and the other countries that have come out against 

477.05 477.57 A: france 

488.24 488.87 B: the uh 

489.65 498.84 B: uh resolution against them you know as far as attacking and and the only reason they are saying that is -cause right now they are guaranteed all the oil they want at a reasonable price 

491.68 492.06 A: uh-huh 

499.72 502.97 B: and and that's part of the reason and it goes back to economics 

504.11 509.09 B: and and i still think that gas would not be as high as it is today if it was done nine years ago 

509.32 509.58 A: yeah 

510.12 511.20 A: oh absolutely 

511.61 517.54 A: i mean it's it's what we should've done now we've now we've got more support than we did have nine years ago though 

517.72 521.11 B: i think we do and and i think that the american people
