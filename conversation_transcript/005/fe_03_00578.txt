218.31 218.83 A: i uh 

219.23 220.43 A: i don't know i i think 

221.58 222.89 A: i i try to think of why is it 

223.36 227.88 A: popular with people all of think of is they love to see somebody else making fools of themselves 

228.56 229.90 B: yeah 

229.33 230.41 A: you know laugh at somebody else 

230.78 231.73 A: you know for a change 

232.03 233.22 A: rather than themselves 

235.08 235.75 B: yeah you know i 

236.87 238.75 B: i guess that must be it huh 

239.00 239.45 A: yeah 

239.73 242.33 B: i can't really figure it out (( )) 

241.06 242.16 A: i mean well the s- 

242.27 244.45 A: survivor i can honestly say 

245.90 247.22 A: it gets really petty 

247.90 248.43 A: you know 

248.02 248.39 B: (( oh )) 

248.89 249.56 B: (( )) 

249.07 254.13 A: you don't see these people in the best light you know at the beginning they really they're very conscience of the cameras 

254.74 255.14 B: uh-huh 

255.23 256.05 A: you know so they're 

256.74 257.78 A: trying to be you know make 

258.09 259.37 A: different impressions to 

259.56 260.44 A: to the audiences 

261.47 263.73 A: but after a while you can tell that they don't 

264.20 266.88 A: you know they're so used to the cameras there twenty four hours a day 

267.70 268.90 A: that they sort of ignore it 

269.73 270.19 A: you know 

269.81 271.39 B: after a while they just don't give a 

271.73 272.69 B: a hoot 

272.61 273.11 A: yeah 

273.26 273.71 A: yeah 

275.39 277.98 B: so that first season that you watched all the time 

278.94 279.27 B: um 

279.97 280.59 B: made you keep 

281.47 282.74 B: tuning in it was just a 

282.30 287.76 A: eh you you got interested in the people themselves as individuals and you wanted to see if they 

288.26 291.87 A: reacted the way you thought they would react to something that was happening 

292.64 293.98 A: even my daughter who is 

294.10 294.84 A: you know she's 

295.39 295.87 A: forty 

296.51 297.52 A: years old and 

298.47 303.11 A: she was calling me okay did you watch this did you watch that you know what do you think 

304.04 308.56 A: and then you know you get down towards the end and you start you have your favorite who do you want to win 

309.29 309.87 B: yeah and that's so 

309.31 309.76 A: you know 

310.05 313.41 B: that's a good point i think maybe that's why people watch it too 

313.81 316.44 B: because you get attached to people and then they 

313.84 314.16 A: yeah 

315.93 316.31 A: yeah 

316.48 320.15 A: you you it's just like a horse race you pick out your favorite 

316.56 316.92 B: yeah 

317.26 317.86 B: they relate 

319.44 321.75 B: right so did your favorite 

320.62 322.29 A: and i always lose there too 

321.84 323.95 B: oh 

324.25 325.42 B: how about your daughter 

325.66 326.12 A: huh 

325.84 327.61 B: did her favorite win or 

327.93 332.28 A: no both of us w- i uh the thing is that we didn't know until the end that we both liked the same person 

329.06 329.98 B: oh 

332.44 333.25 B: oh 

333.23 333.66 A: yeah 

333.92 335.46 B: oh 

333.98 336.62 A: no- not all we cared about is the one person didn't win 

337.26 338.21 B: oh 

337.33 338.91 A: and then of course that's the one that did win 

339.38 340.47 B: is that the one that 

341.00 343.79 B: oh okay was that he one i heard there was one where 

344.03 345.30 A: he liked to walk around naked 

344.46 344.71 B: oh 

345.93 349.00 B: oh no i didn't hear that oh my god 

347.38 347.67 A: yeah 

348.17 350.23 A: yeah he liked to walk around naked and he was gay 

350.71 352.01 B: oh my goodness 

352.13 353.45 B: how strange 

353.03 354.20 A: yeah uh 

354.37 356.37 A: he was an interesting person though i mean 

356.45 357.96 B: oh yeah he sounds (( interesting )) 

357.35 357.65 A: fairly 

357.97 358.82 A: fairly intelligent 

359.37 359.94 B: oh really 

361.54 362.01 B: so i- 

362.63 363.37 A: he uh 

362.77 363.32 B: well the 

363.69 366.70 A: you know he had a grown not a grown son a teenage son and all 

369.00 369.49 B: camera just 

369.87 370.74 B: black him out or 

371.11 372.29 A: yeah parts 

372.56 373.50 A: parts anyways 

373.66 375.99 A: or just show him from the waist up 

377.54 378.38 A: but it was funny 

381.66 384.13 A: (( plus )) he was very heavy when he started this show 

384.73 386.82 A: and he when at the end of the show 

387.92 389.43 A: he had lost so much weight it was just 

389.59 391.04 A: skin hanging from him you know 

391.30 391.68 B: oh so 

391.86 394.67 B: do they have to fend for themselves and get their own food 

394.58 395.04 A: yeah 

396.90 399.25 A: yeah they're given certain staples but they 

399.37 401.02 A: if they use it up ahead of time 

401.94 403.10 A: they didn't get anymore 

404.50 404.81 A: plus 

405.84 406.85 A: uh there are 

407.10 409.21 A: natural disasters you know floods 

409.31 412.40 A: or storms and whatever and they could lost that those things 

413.01 414.05 A: because they have to make their own 

414.70 418.84 A: shelter and all you know so i mean in in i think that wha- show was a lot more interesting i 

419.27 422.54 A: have no interest in watching those people living living in a house 

423.79 424.46 A: or you know 

425.49 426.46 A: that kind of stuff but 

426.77 427.95 A: and out in the 

428.39 431.71 A: in the wilderness or you know where anything like that 

432.83 434.50 A: it's a lot rougher than camping you know 

434.91 435.72 B: that's true you know i 

436.03 438.53 B: now that you said that i think i did see 

439.11 442.99 B: a show where everyone was living in a house and i don't know what that was 

443.57 444.92 B: and i just saw this one 

445.25 446.60 B: episode where everyone was 

446.96 451.18 B: the women were crying and they were saying goodbye to someone or something and 

451.38 451.85 A: oh 

451.78 452.17 B: (( )) 

451.99 454.16 A: somebody got voted out or lost out or something 

453.50 454.26 B: oh maybe 

454.38 457.10 B: maybe that was does that sound familiar to you 

457.40 458.69 A: yeah i saw part of that 

458.89 459.89 A: that was the one 

459.03 459.51 B: oh 

460.63 462.26 A: i saw maybe five minutes of it 

462.65 463.53 B: oh yeah (( )) 

462.96 465.56 A: not that particular show but it just doesn't appeal to me 

466.04 466.81 B: you know now that i 

466.91 468.09 B: now that you mention i 

471.15 474.04 A: oh it is good i mean it is it it's good 

474.39 475.35 A: in the sense that 

477.16 478.88 A: they they have more difficulties 

480.02 481.51 A: on you know physical 

482.79 483.38 A: mental 

484.23 484.56 A: you know 

484.92 485.46 A: element 

487.00 488.48 A: uh the environment 

491.00 491.46 B: that first 

491.03 493.26 A: i think it was one of the we- i can't remember i 

493.45 495.08 A: i think it was in australia 

496.52 496.83 A: that 

497.65 498.16 A: they caught 

498.27 498.77 A: something 

499.35 500.65 A: that they weren't supposed too 

500.89 502.01 A: but nobody knew it was 

502.16 502.54 A: you know 

503.47 504.20 A: a endangered 

504.28 507.27 A: species it was either africa or australia i don't remember which one 

508.56 510.47 A: and they found out after and you know the 

512.65 513.48 A: sponsors had a 

515.04 515.60 A: they paid a 

515.80 516.30 A: fine and 

516.55 517.04 A: took your 

517.78 520.43 A: you know it was just something they weren't aware of at the time 

522.16 524.98 A: because they're generally told ahead of time what they can and can't do 

525.37 529.17 B: well so they don't have contact with anyone saying oh by the way don't don't uh 

530.02 531.91 B: pick that up or something like that they 

531.82 532.97 A: well there if 

533.10 538.24 A: if the sponsors and the producers and them know that ahead of time i then they are told 

539.67 539.96 A: but 

540.48 542.45 A: sometimes i mean these thing are just happening 

543.60 545.30 A: and it's too late for them to be told 

545.82 549.58 B: that one season that you watch the entire thing where was that the africa 

550.42 552.73 A: no i think i can't even remember where it was 

553.23 553.55 B: okay 

553.77 555.31 B: because they provide shelter 

554.82 555.35 A: been about 

555.59 557.31 A: three years ago now i don't remember 

556.54 557.35 B: oh 

557.62 559.07 B: oh it was that long 

559.29 560.90 A: yeah time flies when you're having fun 

560.91 561.53 B: uh 

562.57 564.58 B: didn't know these shows were around that long i just 

564.96 565.51 A: yeah 

565.61 569.03 A: yeah well you know the older you get the faster the years go so
