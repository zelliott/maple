112.34 114.02 B: okay sure um 

114.49 118.77 B: [sigh] i don't even remember all those things that they said i think uh 

118.98 120.46 B: i don't think i think 

120.71 126.02 B: i g- i i guess i'll do mine by a process of elimination since there were so many um 

126.29 136.32 B: drinking alcohol obviously i don't think is really a big deal although drinking excessive alcohol i guess is uh is pretty is i- it can be harmful 

136.20 141.34 B: especially those people around you if uh if anyone becomes violent or abusive 

136.69 137.28 A: (( ahah )) 

141.17 142.15 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

141.42 146.71 B: you know that's definitely not a good situation but uh overall i don't think that's a major [lipsmack] 

146.62 156.87 B: um problem [sigh] i think smoking isn't uh too healthy [sigh] since it hurts the people around you like regardless of [sigh] um you know what you do 

157.25 165.79 B: you know your attitude unlike alcohol [sigh] and uh it really serves no purpose and it's just a waste of money you know basically that's my view of smoking 

160.15 160.82 A: mhm 

163.37 164.27 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

165.96 171.48 A: oh okay like among all of these what do you find the worst one [laughter] 

171.15 174.08 B: the worst one i'm it's um 

174.27 182.36 B: [sigh] it's kind of a toss up i mean none of them are are atrocities you know i guess uh 

181.13 182.00 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

182.49 187.17 B: i guess smoking is is probably one of the worst [sigh] with um 

188.00 195.30 B: [lipsmack] maybe not exercising because um you know i think everybody should exercise i'm a big uh like fitness 

193.70 194.38 A: (( mhm )) 

195.42 200.93 B: um activity stuff like that but i i would probably say smoking because that hurts the people around you 

195.61 196.35 A: (( yeah )) 

200.94 202.79 B: and that's so um 

202.98 206.57 B: you know it's it's plu- prolific in our society 

206.72 210.22 B: and you know and uh i i think that's probably one of the worst [sigh] 

210.43 211.48 B: what about you 

211.56 214.14 A: [sigh] about me oh i feel 

214.18 220.86 A: coming to business smoking alcohol and all first thing i don't like is smoking at all 

220.62 222.32 B: mhm mhm 

221.60 227.61 A: yeah and also they asked a question about gossiping too that also i don't like at all it's a big 

227.80 240.74 A: uh mistake people do by gossiping about others and make the feelings hurt [sigh] so gossiping also i don't feel is good and coming to drinking alcohol it's okay because in the present society 

230.85 231.88 B: (( i know )) 

240.97 244.84 A: alcohol like that if they drink a little [sigh] 

244.65 258.04 A: that's fine but [mn] greater going to extremes is too bad and it's just ruining so many people's lives [sigh] that's a different story but if it's turning it that's fine that's n- that's not a big thing [sigh] and uh 

245.60 246.71 B: mhm 

248.32 249.19 B: right 

251.10 252.06 B: mhm 

255.15 256.71 B: [sigh] yeah 

257.87 262.52 A: (( about smoking it should be [sigh] the way that i feel like )) 

262.65 275.13 A: we shouldn't uh like [sigh] support smoking people who smoke because it's not at all good for the people around and also [sigh] like the person in point of health 

266.89 267.71 B: right 

270.99 271.95 B: mhm 

276.00 279.33 A: so i don't like smoking much and 

277.95 279.71 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] yeah me either [sigh] 

279.79 293.93 A: and about gossiping also i don't feel good about that because it hurts the other person's feelings a lot so um [sigh] so i i see so many people are like getting depressed about uh gossiping because [mn] 

285.37 286.50 B: mhm 

292.48 293.54 B: mhm 

294.51 303.81 A: we feel low when somebody talks ill about us so [sigh] i don't like gossiping too and smoking uh uh uh no no not not not my 

299.80 300.63 B: mhm 

303.17 303.80 B: (( [sigh] )) 

304.02 308.74 B: yeah [sigh] i guess i don't view gossiping as bad but that's because i'm a guy probably [sigh] 

304.27 306.05 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

308.69 310.22 A: well [laughter] 

308.81 315.21 B: you know i jus- i just view it as uh like human nature where people are just going to talk about other people behind their back 

312.05 313.13 A: mhm 

315.17 316.28 A: yeah 

315.87 324.02 B: you know it's it is bad mm but people are going to do it regardless you know and there's [sigh] i'm unlike like smoking or alcohol it could never be [sigh] 

323.93 331.47 B: um you know made illegal or anything [laughter] like that and i just guess it's just you know something that people have to deal with in my opinion 

331.63 332.76 A: yeah 

332.17 333.57 B: for better or worse 

333.83 337.43 A: yeah that's true like uh [sigh] uh 

337.59 341.27 A: the place where i work uh it's uh like 

341.37 349.35 A: non uh smoking building where i work because uh they had so many problems before with people who smoke and all 

343.53 345.22 B: mhm mhm 

349.05 350.05 B: mhm 

349.36 350.20 A: (( so )) 

351.02 364.46 A: so now it no-one is allowed to smoke in the building so it's a non-smoking building so it's good [sigh] yeah [sigh] and uh like [sigh] uh we have our friday parties 

355.20 356.17 B: mhm 

357.32 359.10 B: cool yeah 

364.30 365.29 B: mhm 

364.45 367.06 A: (( where people will go like uh )) 

368.18 381.82 A: to a nearby restaurant or hotel or something like that and there people enjoy they have a good friday [laughter] sort of thing [sigh] so there they have their fags they have alcohol and all but that's okay when it's there their personal 

371.11 372.43 B: mhm 

374.29 375.53 B: mhm 

381.86 386.73 A: celebration or something like that but not uh when we are around people 

386.51 391.17 B: mhm yeah yeah or people that don't like appreciate it 

391.30 392.48 A: yeah 

391.68 393.33 B: you know or approve of it [sigh] 

393.27 394.40 A: yeah 

393.54 394.10 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

395.00 404.87 B: well that's cool that's cool yeah we have pretty similar views it seems like as far as less smoking you know is is probably one of the least healthy 

395.35 396.21 A: (( so )) 

404.88 405.84 A: yeah 

404.95 407.59 B: um activities that they listed 

407.47 415.69 A: yeah many people die because of smoking too because of they get cancer or something like that lung cancer and uh [sigh] uh 

409.77 410.76 B: yeah 

411.65 412.64 B: mhm 

414.36 419.32 B: yeah and even people that don't smoke that are just around people that do smoke 

418.76 419.82 A: you do 

419.68 428.54 B: no no people that around people like people that don't smoke that are around people who do smoke can also get those diseases [sigh] and cancer and stuff 

421.93 423.05 A: mhm 

426.66 434.40 A: yeah that's true that's true yeah yeah yeah that's true so you need to be careful do anybody in your family have this habit 

433.51 435.15 B: [lipsmack] no no

443.68 444.72 B: mhm 

444.00 454.42 A: and very few men uh smoke they do it's very hard to control them but that's okay if there was some point or that they would so but women 

451.10 452.25 B: mhm
