35.46 36.51 A: and where do you live

39.07 39.58 A: okay 

41.59 47.65 B: same as you i used to get sicker a lot more when it changed but now as i'm older it doesn't effect me as much 

47.43 47.81 A: uh-huh

58.80 59.22 B: stay 

59.35 60.18 B: healthy or 

60.44 61.94 A: well you know i take um 

62.21 65.65 A: when i do get a little cold i take echinacea 

65.92 67.38 B: oh really does that seem to help 

67.64 68.69 A: it it seems to 

69.15 70.18 A: yo know i mean 

69.28 69.76 B: yeah 

70.55 74.89 B: yeah i've heard that (( )) you can take too i've taken those 

75.11 75.63 B: for it but 

76.32 77.12 B: i didn't really 

77.85 79.33 B: and like they said i mean 

79.55 81.86 B: some some illnesses take like three days and 

82.02 85.36 B: they're going to take three days whether to take something or not 

85.67 95.33 B: that seems like it sometimes unless sometimes i go to the doctor and um antibiotics seem to help maybe a little bit quicker with some illnesses like if i have a 

85.71 86.12 A: yeah 

91.92 92.44 A: do they 

95.50 97.38 B: sore or something ill notice 

97.51 100.59 B: you know if i don't go to the doctor it's a lot more drawn out 

97.52 98.16 A: yeah 

100.77 101.37 B: i finally 

102.23 104.45 B: break down because it's bad (( )) let them go then 

104.70 105.73 B: i noticed it helps 

106.39 107.13 B: in that case 

106.56 107.14 A: yes 

107.23 107.71 B: but 

108.22 111.80 B: like a the flu or anything else i think it just has to run its course 

112.29 114.36 A: yeah a lot of time with a cold especially 

114.54 114.98 A: um 

115.34 115.83 A: i'm 

116.48 117.73 A: one of those people that um 

118.49 121.07 A: i don't i don't go the doctor unless i think i'm going to die 

121.07 126.04 B: yeah me too it's too expensive for one and it takes too much time out of the day 

122.11 122.46 A: um 

126.20 130.01 B: if i can make it and get to work and get through it then 

130.40 131.70 B: i don't go either 

131.63 132.14 A: yes 

132.26 133.69 A: i i can not believe what 

134.55 139.61 A: they said on the tape at the beginning that if you don't go to the doctor it lasts seven days and if you do it lasts a week 

139.98 140.55 B: yeah 

140.15 140.56 A: you know 

140.65 142.09 A: a lot of times like uh 

142.55 147.05 A: with a cold i know that they're going to tell you to drink a lot of fluids and rest and 

148.27 150.33 A: and you know you already know that stuff 

150.50 151.76 B: right most of the time it's 

151.90 152.17 B: that 

152.33 152.84 B: going to be 

153.46 155.32 B: what you need to (( )) 

155.54 161.03 B: so the doctor and to tell you that and not this much for a virus or a viral infection they can do anyway 

161.52 162.03 A: yeah 

162.93 163.31 A: yeah 

162.97 166.14 B: not really worth going the only time i'll like go is like you said is 

167.30 171.45 B: maybe strep throat or something i know is not going to get better unless i go and 

171.86 172.31 A: yeah 

173.26 173.80 B: (( )) 

173.55 174.10 A: and and 

174.56 175.44 A: (( )) 

176.44 177.05 B: yeah 

176.72 177.37 A: even then 

177.44 181.24 B: yeah i agree unless i can't get out of bed and it stays that way for 

182.12 185.29 B: for a while but that's probably not even once a year that 

186.31 187.66 B: i'll break down and go 

187.81 188.20 A: yeah 

188.53 189.72 A: i remember i took uh 

190.64 192.26 A: i think (( )) of 

192.52 194.65 A: oh a year or two ago when i had a cold 

195.42 195.79 A: um 

195.99 197.37 A: i'm not sure if it helped or not 

197.53 199.64 B: was that the zinc (( )) or 

199.31 199.70 A: yeah 

200.15 202.21 A: yeah the zinc now the echinacea you're 

202.66 203.98 A: you're only suppose to take it 

204.23 205.74 A: you know you're not suppose to take it 

206.23 208.40 A: you know like daily all the time you're suppose to 

207.64 209.23 B: oh it's not like a preventative 

209.33 211.00 B: thing daily it's just 

209.63 210.09 A: no 

211.22 217.05 A: at least that's what some one told me is you're suppose to take it like you know the way you would take an antibiotic you don't take it unless you are sick 

216.94 219.47 B: oh so that at the onset of symptoms then you just 

219.93 221.25 B: start taking it 

221.41 221.75 A: yeah 

221.94 224.04 B: do you notice the big difference in that 

228.13 233.97 A: it helps and uh you know like i said you know i guess there is a possibility that it is a coincidence that i was going to get well anyway 

234.04 236.37 B: that's true but i mean a lot can probably be 

236.51 242.77 B: you know mental too if you think somethings working sometimes it does positive outlook which 

241.60 242.02 A: yeah 

243.54 245.50 B: i mean that could be quite a bit too but 

246.13 247.87 B: it's hard to tell with something like that 

248.13 249.02 A: yeah it sure is 

249.42 249.79 B: but 

250.34 253.12 B: if your body thinks it's getting better i mean that's not bad if 

253.65 255.99 A: oh i think uh i think that makes a big difference 

256.55 256.98 A: um 

257.64 261.09 A: a matter of fact it's funny i was just reading uh an article today in uh 

262.19 262.54 A: um 

262.96 263.40 A: (( )) 

263.65 265.03 A: newsweek oh no it was time 

265.65 265.97 A: and it 

266.31 268.86 A: uh it's called how your mind can heal your body 

268.99 269.49 B: mhm 

269.63 269.96 A: and it 

270.06 270.60 A: the current 

270.82 272.50 A: the current issue i guess is uh 

273.30 273.70 A: um 

273.86 274.99 A: you know the january issue 

275.40 277.37 A: but anyway it talks about how um 

278.92 281.52 A: you know doctors are finding out more and more 

282.26 284.02 A: you know your overall attitude 

284.37 285.03 A: and uh 

285.73 286.40 A: you know your 

286.65 288.07 A: your mental health effects your 

288.49 289.85 A: your physical health quite a bit 

289.79 292.99 B: yeah it's true i really believe that my brother got in like 

293.21 303.94 B: wasn't a really bad car accident but he got in a car accident about a year ago and i mean he didn't get that hurt but his back was hurt and he wasn't feeling to good and he just 

301.85 302.32 A: uh-huh 

304.19 308.74 B: just had a really bad attitude about it and you know thought he as in pain in pain and 

309.00 319.04 B: i mean but like a year later he was still having symptoms and problems and the doctors couldn't figure it out but he finally started to 

319.25 322.12 B: get out and you know try to make himself feel better you know 

322.11 322.48 A: yeah 

322.52 323.80 B: better so 

323.93 326.30 B: think a lot of it is wanting to get better or 

326.46 328.33 B: get passed (( )) 

328.17 331.87 A: yeah i i and i really believe that i remember when i was 

332.36 335.40 A: when i was really small i was maybe four or five years old and i was playing 

336.31 336.62 A: you know 

336.80 338.34 A: cowboys and indians or whatever 

339.01 339.37 A: and i 

339.49 340.89 A: i feel and i cut my knee 

341.37 342.16 A: and i got 

342.33 342.66 A: i got 

342.94 344.47 A: you know its cut fairly bad you know it's 

345.15 346.41 A: bleeding a lot and everything 

347.07 347.62 A: and um 

347.75 350.69 A: you know i went up to the house and i was thinking it didn't really hurt 

350.92 351.59 A: much at all 

352.16 354.05 A: and i was thinking it was kind of cool because i was 

354.62 356.57 A: playing cowboys and indians and i got shot or something 

358.84 360.11 A: almost like it was fun you know 

360.63 362.68 A: i showed my mom and my mom freaked out 

363.41 364.89 A: and i remember it started hurting 

365.78 367.07 A: you know and it didn't really hurt 

368.31 369.92 A: until she started freaking out about it 

369.95 376.86 B: yeah sometimes that makes you more it makes you think it's a lot worse then when somebody else really freaks out 

370.60 371.52 A: you know what i mean 

375.24 375.70 A: yeah 

375.82 376.26 A: so 

377.05 378.07 B: was it kind of like 

378.19 380.42 B: to the to the bone or just the like 

379.86 384.61 A: well it was pretty bad i still have a scar i don't remember getting stitches or anything like that but uh 

385.07 387.03 A: i guess it was you know fairly bad 

386.08 388.58 B: bad enough for her to think it was pretty bad 

388.49 388.89 A: yeah 

389.23 389.57 A: yeah 

389.95 391.75 B: do in that article that you read 

391.88 393.25 B: did they do studies 

394.04 395.02 B: prove that or 

395.37 395.81 A: yeah 

395.91 401.05 A: yeah i'm i'm not all the way i'm not quite through it you know i've only read about half of it and put it down so far but uh 

401.80 403.08 A: you know they they did uh 

403.51 404.84 A: studies on like you know cats 

405.00 406.20 A: cancer patients and 

406.64 409.26 A: you know people with really severe illnesses 

408.70 409.16 B: mhm 

410.06 411.19 A: you know the people that had the 

411.78 412.16 A: you know the 

412.57 413.44 A: more optimistic 

413.80 414.53 A: brighter outlook 

415.46 416.21 A: really did 

416.52 416.87 A: uh 

417.36 419.04 A: you know had more progress and everything 

419.25 419.82 B: wow 

419.89 420.55 A: and um 

421.09 421.97 A: you know and they 

423.05 425.46 A: you know also talked about a lot of drugs they prescribed 

425.79 426.21 A: now 

427.70 430.77 A: really don't have that much effect because they studied people that took 

431.45 432.81 A: you know these mental health drugs 

433.15 433.84 B: yeah 

434.02 434.65 A: and um 

435.51 436.47 A: you know the people with the 

437.33 438.91 A: with the more positive attitude 

439.85 444.23 A: really faired better then the same people that didn't have the positive attitude that were taking the drugs so 

444.05 447.62 B: yeah these days i think they're so in a hurry to 

447.73 450.44 B: prescribe a pill for everything 

451.01 451.71 A: oh i know 

451.27 457.34 B: it's like whether you need it or not here here's a prescription and take this and you'll be better even though it's 

457.47 458.40 B: probably isn't 

459.25 460.99 B: isn't good for you to just run and 

461.30 463.32 B: take a med medication you know but 

463.61 464.72 A: oh i know and i think it's 

464.87 466.21 A: i think it's really uh 

466.62 467.62 A: over done with kids 

467.75 468.75 A: too i i really 

468.11 468.81 B: yeah 

469.17 471.30 A: worry about that because they're still developing 

470.25 470.64 B: yeah 

477.20 477.77 A: uh 

479.63 483.19 B: but i'm sure if i were to take him to a doctor or something i you know could get him one 

483.55 487.51 B: ritalin or something but i mean that's awful i would never want him to be 

485.04 485.65 A: oh 

488.05 488.53 A: oh that 

488.18 488.54 B: and 

488.64 489.99 B: but i couldn't i mean 

490.42 496.04 B: he's hyper i mean that's part of growing up you i think a lot of parents just want it easier for them so they just 

496.34 498.06 B: go put their kids on some 

496.49 497.15 A: oh sure 

498.07 498.80 A: oh sure and it's 

498.35 502.58 B: drugs and they're developing their minds developing and i think that's 

502.70 504.64 B: a real bad idea unless it's a real 

505.19 507.56 B: bad case that they can't even 

508.34 513.11 B: concentrate or something but i mean a lot of parents are just running out and 

514.22 518.35 B: putting them on something to just control them at home i think 

518.01 520.62 A: yeah and uh uh the schools really push it to 

520.64 521.91 B: yeah they do because
