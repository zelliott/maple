311.75 312.31 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

312.48 315.51 A: like lend a helping hand or something

321.66 323.58 B: [laughter] well i know 

324.12 331.27 B: i know a lot of people that are pr- are practising that random ki- acts of kindness [sigh] which i think is a wonderful idea 

327.41 328.55 A: yes 

329.04 329.74 A: yeah 

331.62 337.65 B: when i was [sigh] growing up that was just accepted everybody did that [laughter] 

337.66 344.81 A: did yeah yeah and we've gotten away from it um [lipsmack] i know i grew up with my grandfather living 

338.99 340.26 B: yes 

344.81 347.43 A: in a room and everything in like a 

347.38 351.48 A: little area that we had built off the back of the garage he helped my mother and father build our house 

350.38 351.16 B: uh-huh 

351.40 363.30 A: [sigh] and we had a real good sized bedroom with a bath and everything you know a t._v. and that back there but he'd come down in the house by us during the day and in the evening if we were there you know [sigh] and you'd gain a real respect but [sigh] um [lipsmack] 

363.54 368.77 A: i think what i try to do because i grew up with him i never had a babys- we never had babysitters 

367.45 370.26 B: no i didn't either and neither did my children [sigh] 

370.18 372.28 A: mhm [lipsmack] and i think 

372.17 380.93 A: um what i always try to do [sigh] um people it's funny how people look at you right now if i go to the grocery store [sigh] and somebody is 

380.79 390.84 A: picking the groceries out of their cart and putting them in their vehicle [sigh] and they've got the cart just about empty and i need you know i'm going to use the cart in the store anyway i'll say to 'em i'll take your cart back in if you're done they look at you like [mn] 

384.96 385.68 B: yeah 

389.94 390.97 B: yeah 

391.14 395.20 A: oh [laughter] okay [sigh] or you know be in the store and help somebody 

393.89 403.07 B: yes but i'm finding well i'm as you've probably guessed i'm not very young [sigh] and i do find now like in the uh supermarkets 

395.47 396.41 A: yeah 

403.26 404.15 A: mhm 

403.32 404.25 B: uh 

404.20 405.78 B: elderly people 

405.70 416.08 B: will help me if they see i'm struggling to reach something or get something [sigh] whereas the younger [sigh] people get annoyed with me and hit me with their [laughter] carts because i don't get out of their way 

408.00 409.39 A: yeah 

413.84 414.71 A: if you 

415.97 423.00 B: fast enough [lipsmack] but the i will if i need help [sigh] uh i notice it's the older people who come to my aid 

416.42 418.02 A: (( yeah yeah mhm )) 

423.04 427.05 B: [lipsmack] i guess because that was something we learned as children 

426.73 428.98 A: yes i think so i think that's true joan 

427.96 430.83 B: yeah and that and it seems that this the 

430.87 437.79 B: new generation isn't teaching their children that [sigh] i have seen so many rude little children 

434.45 435.26 A: no 

438.00 439.45 A: mhm 

438.27 447.25 B: or little children that are in stores screaming because they want something and their mothers [sigh] are ignoring them [sigh] and then will hit their mothers 

445.35 446.38 A: yeah

548.94 550.05 B: yes 

551.15 560.82 B: well i learned to plant and everything [sigh] from my grandfather [sigh] by working along side of him [sigh] so and i as i said i think that's a good way to raise children 

559.91 560.63 A: (( mhm )) 

560.78 567.23 A: yes it is yeah [sigh] i don't plant any garden [sigh] um we have deer that come through here where we are

566.04 567.01 B: oh 

567.19 580.91 A: and rabbits so [laughter] [laughter] no i'd rather not feed them that way so um and just with working it's too much to try to keep the weeds and everything out of it and our soil is more sandy 

567.52 571.09 B: oh well you wouldn't have any of that lasting very long [laughter] 

576.78 577.86 B: yeah 

579.72 580.66 B: yeah 

580.93 588.78 A: i said i can stop at the uh farmers' markets and the different markets easier than i can try to keep the weeds out of the garden [laughter] 

585.96 592.48 B: yeah sure well i i'm retired of course so i had that's my main [laughter] occupation 

590.02 590.97 A: mhm 

592.47 593.66 A: yeah 

592.64 599.89 B: and [sigh] i do enjoy it it gives me exercise fresh air [sigh] and [sigh] it would be much cheaper for me to go to
