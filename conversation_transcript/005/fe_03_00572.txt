414.19 415.64 A: as well as mental contests 

415.83 416.28 B: mhm

418.82 419.57 A: um 

421.00 422.55 A: the two winners would 

422.74 424.85 A: kind of duke it out against each other 

425.47 427.84 A: no i'm sorry the one winner would kind a 

428.82 429.84 A: challenge himself 

430.05 431.28 A: mentally against 

431.68 433.06 A: the four losers 

433.40 434.67 A: and they they were the dog

442.45 443.17 B: or he did 

448.07 448.57 B: uh-huh 

448.19 449.89 A: and then it was like a mental 

450.08 452.28 A: you know like quiz type thing where they were pitted against 

453.06 453.62 A: the four 

453.85 454.51 A: like the four 

454.73 457.76 A: people could conspire i think among themselves and 

458.06 459.98 A: see if they could win and um 

460.11 461.40 A: they incentive was 

461.77 463.74 A: you know the the dog pound would 

463.98 464.99 A: i think divide up 

465.14 466.18 A: x. number of them 

466.28 471.83 A: money or something i only watched that a couple of times and didn't find that nearly um 

468.06 468.53 B: right 

471.99 472.69 A: nearly as 

472.30 473.70 B: very very fascinating 

473.13 473.60 A: no 

473.77 474.30 A: no 

474.09 476.02 B: why i i don't think women in general 

476.40 481.89 B: i don't know from what i've seen are real interested in physical 

482.42 485.21 B: you know if someone taking on somebody else it's more i think 

485.67 487.04 B: that actually the 

488.03 489.90 B: the match making kind of ones were 

490.01 493.97 B: lack of a better word are are more likely to get a female audience then 

491.32 491.78 A: mhm 

494.29 495.06 B: something where 

495.38 498.07 B: people are taking each other on physically although 

498.31 502.31 B: when i saw um survivor i mean that was kind of physical too they 

502.49 503.52 B: they got to the point 

503.72 505.48 B: the one i saw where they had to eat a 

505.75 507.09 B: they had to eat these bugs 

507.12 508.00 A: yeah they 

507.49 511.66 B: well actually they did like a russian roulette 

512.35 514.81 B: they had to eat whatever it landed on 

514.85 515.47 A: yes 

515.78 517.45 B: and 

516.65 522.84 A: i think that's kind of i've seen it i haven't seen it but i've seen the the advertisements for fear factor 

523.00 523.45 B: uh-huh 

523.67 524.98 A: do you have you ever seen those 

524.94 526.04 B: no ah uh 

525.71 526.85 A: oh that's another 

527.00 528.12 A: reality t._v. 

528.36 529.94 A: game contest and 

530.07 531.47 A: they make people sort of 

531.79 537.38 A: overcome their greatest fears which are could be physical or a lot of eating disgusting things 

538.15 538.68 B: really 

538.61 541.05 A: yeah like i've seen people put in 

541.22 541.94 A: tanks with 

542.20 544.97 A: you know snakes and all these horrible things 

545.27 546.23 B: why why do you think 

546.45 547.69 B: they one of the things they 

547.94 548.89 B: ask is why they 

548.98 550.03 B: do you think people watch 

552.05 552.78 A: um 

553.27 555.17 A: a warrior type of 

555.15 556.14 B: yeah 

555.32 557.94 A: (( experience )) i'm not sure my phone 

556.81 558.92 B: to see if they really will do it 

558.55 560.38 A: my phone is starting to beep here like it's 

560.59 561.61 A: like it's running out of 

561.96 564.59 A: gas at some put you know the battery 

564.30 565.00 B: oh okay 

564.72 567.82 A: so if we get cut off i think we are probably close to that ten minutes 

567.97 568.94 A: but um 

567.97 569.81 B: yeah well i think they they'll 

570.16 574.27 B: sound it like at thirty seconds they'll give us a warning so we won't just get cut off 

574.11 576.68 A: i know but i won't have i mean if i get cut off 

575.59 577.68 B: yeah in case you're not there 

577.26 578.28 A: yeah my phone it's 

578.92 580.61 A: i hope it will count still then 

580.44 580.99 B: yeah 

581.15 581.71 A: um 

581.94 584.77 A: i think you're right i think that um people 

585.28 586.65 A: people just like 

586.79 589.50 A: ah maybe that window into other peoples lives i don't know 

589.77 590.33 B: yeah 

590.82 592.42 B: well i don't know to me 

592.61 595.60 B: i think the only thing that i would have found fascinating 

596.21 597.33 B: is kind of like 

597.77 599.65 B: putting myself in and deciding
