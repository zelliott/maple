81.73 84.93 B: none of us never really had allergies until we moved here and then 

85.54 88.99 B: we all ended up having pretty bad allergies so 

87.93 92.70 A: oh yeah well i'll tell you what my dad was in the air force i was born in houston and 

92.45 93.27 B: oh you were 

101.97 103.13 B: oh no 

103.81 105.36 A: so this was a big deal back then 

105.41 106.19 B: yeah 

109.21 111.17 A: and then moved all over the world from there 

110.45 112.43 B: oh see you lived california too 

112.13 113.01 A: and i didn't 

113.16 116.17 A: i didn't get tonsillitis again until i was in college 

113.58 114.07 B: hi 

116.15 117.18 B: wow 

117.16 120.75 A: so something about the gulf coast atmosphere was really 

121.11 122.27 B: yeah 

130.30 131.00 B: yeah 

132.74 134.68 B: so you take just over the counter stuff 

134.80 138.12 A: yeah for us because it's not um 

135.20 136.86 B: yeah that's what i usually take too 

138.46 140.30 B: it's not really severe 

138.96 148.92 A: we don't have the all the sneezing and the things that all people have to take antihistamines for so much that if it's you know sudafed and robitussin about the only th- decongestants there are besides hot 

143.12 143.70 B: yeah 

146.85 147.41 B: yeah 

149.34 151.16 A: good hot steaming something to drink 

154.27 155.14 A: there you go 

154.78 157.00 B: over and you don't need it anymore so 

156.55 157.41 A: that's right 

157.61 160.50 B: so that's good so do you find that you 

160.60 165.28 B: get sick i mean if you get sick it goes away as fast if you go to the doctor or if 

165.18 168.69 A: i'd say unless that was one thing like we've lived 

168.79 171.62 A: here in east texas for um twenty years and 

172.41 178.21 A: we could tell when the kids were growing up it the doctor you know we'd get the sni- they'd get the sniffles and everything and it was when they turned that 

178.64 180.40 A: nice (( greeny )) yellow 

180.18 182.02 B: yeah that's the time 

180.97 187.03 A: then it was the s- then it was eh you know an infection you went ahead and went to the doctor but we pretty got got pretty 

183.33 183.81 B: (( )) 

185.35 185.96 B: right 

187.79 188.77 A: used to 

188.99 190.94 A: if it starts to stop up for a headache 

191.12 192.44 A: take the sudafed 

192.40 193.44 B: yeah (( because )) 

200.24 202.48 A: billion kids everyday and you talk about 

202.59 204.88 A: everything that could possibly walk in the door 

204.60 207.21 B: right that's a good place for germs 

205.52 206.21 A: you you don't 

206.75 209.77 A: yeah you don't want to leave yourself too open to that sort of thing 

209.99 210.55 B: no 

210.62 212.60 A: so but unless it's an infection we don't 

212.72 213.09 A: you know 

213.38 218.01 B: yeah pretty much the doctor was going to tell you the same thing anyway take some sudafed and 

213.65 214.65 A: that we don't have to do 

218.83 227.93 B: fluids and yeah that's why i usually don't go to the doctor unless i'm really really sick because nine times out of ten he's just going to say rest and fluids and 

228.44 232.68 B: something over the counter unless it's like strep or something then it's not going to get an- 

231.16 233.29 A: right and now they have this fast 

233.44 239.57 A: test my kids haven't had strep knock on wood in a real long time but it used to be you'd do the throat culture and wait 

239.67 240.46 A: a day 

240.39 242.41 B: right it would be you'd have to 

240.96 245.28 A: and y- they didn't want to give you the antibiotic unless they really really thought you had strep because they 

244.35 248.52 B: that's true you had to call back for the results or something i remember when i was little 

246.35 251.11 A: yeah and then you had to go to the pharmacy and get it and th- but now they have this quick test 

251.50 257.98 A: so that if they do think it's strep you've got a real you can get on the antibiotics real quick because my we live in a real small town but my doctor 

251.58 252.43 B: that's right 

255.17 255.67 B: yeah (( )) 

258.24 258.64 A: is 

258.92 259.62 A: you know (( )) 

259.92 268.99 A: a young man but they say listen if we give you an antibiotic for everything because they com- they'll complain about other patients who come in and say they want an antibiotic for everything 

268.85 271.01 B: oh yeah all the time probably 

269.39 270.12 A: and say 

270.33 270.88 A: if you 

271.35 274.32 A: give an antibiotic for everything the- you're going to get resistance 

274.17 276.82 B: yeah you start to get immune to it or something 

274.53 275.42 A: uh the resistant 

276.16 277.71 A: bacteria and stuff that 

278.31 279.74 A: and if it's a virus a bac- 

279.92 280.45 A: the uh 

281.04 282.90 A: antibiotic won't do anything against 

283.24 284.16 A: that anyway 

284.85 285.77 A: you know so their 

285.42 286.31 B: true 

285.86 288.70 A: their you know if if you know it's not an infection 

288.92 293.86 A: if you r- think it might be we'll go in but if you know it's just the general crud 

294.50 295.94 A: we don't go into the doctor 

295.91 303.52 B: yeah yeah me not me not as much now my my kids are bigger but when they were babies it was like oh i was run 

296.21 296.70 A: you know 

303.65 304.76 B: a lot more because 

304.92 309.90 B: they were littler and i didn't you know i didn't want them to be sick i didn't know if it was something 

310.18 313.00 B: serious that now with my second one it's a lot 

312.98 313.74 A: oh yeah 

313.18 317.93 B: a lot less it's like okay i've already been through this once and it was nothing so 

314.39 315.04 A: yeah do y- 

316.14 325.04 A: yeah it's kind of it's not like the oh when the pacifier falls on the floor you go sanitize it you just kind of dust it off rinse it off if you can give it back yeah 

320.27 323.87 B: yeah you get the ten second rule 

325.17 326.40 A: you get good with this 

327.74 331.65 A: yeah it'll be good the five you ever do the five second rule 

332.58 333.82 A: so 

335.44 336.85 A: it does it does 

336.52 340.46 B: so you know thank god my kids are pretty healthy so 

337.09 338.12 A: even though my (( )) 

339.88 344.42 A: yeah and it seems li- mine were pretty good eaters they would eat most things 

344.74 345.85 A: and they tended 

344.87 345.37 B: yeah 

353.96 360.02 A: broccoli and oranges and macaroni and cheese and anything and they seemed to not get sick as often as their classmates who lived 

355.09 356.00 B: really 

358.35 359.42 B: that's good 

360.89 362.49 A: on mcdonald's and whatever 

362.27 368.86 B: yeah it really does help what they grow up on i'm sure and what they eat if they eat things with vitamins and 

365.48 365.88 A: yeah 

369.49 371.24 B: healthy stuff instead of junk 

371.08 381.58 A: and you can teach them all you want and then they grow up and they do what they want to but hey you can try and i guess when they have their kids then they'll do good you know then they'll know what they're supposed to do 

373.75 376.07 B: (( )) yeah 

382.37 382.87 A: yeah 

385.07 386.10 B: so do you find like 

386.58 388.36 B: (( )) (( the thing at the front said )) 

388.50 392.57 B: that you stay s- sick the same amount of time whether you 

392.75 394.12 B: go to the doctor or 

393.62 396.16 A: when it's a cold if it's the common 

394.86 395.26 B: yeah 

396.71 398.03 A: virus cold 

398.12 398.59 B: then 

398.34 399.63 A: with no complications 

400.07 401.09 B: good (( )) 

400.21 406.32 A: you you're either going to be you know you can stay home and be sick for seven days or go to the doctor and be sick for a week 

406.32 407.63 B: right (( )) 

406.54 408.49 A: because virus they don't have anything yet 

408.94 411.86 A: against it (( antibiotic )) antibiotics 

412.38 414.49 A: aren't any good against the virus now 

413.23 419.27 B: no they won't prescribe them now before i had went and they had did this prescribe antibiotics even though it was like 

414.99 415.54 A: no 

419.65 422.27 B: probably the flu or something but now i've went and 

422.57 428.27 B: recently and they were like no it's just a viral infection and y- there is nothing they can really do so 

427.43 428.17 A: that's right 

428.43 428.90 A: there is 

429.02 439.25 A: now the actual flu flu like we had a really bad right before thanksgiving in fact that our school district had over half the s- no over half of one campus
