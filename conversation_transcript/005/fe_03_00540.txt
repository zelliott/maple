2.81 4.55 A: hi this is crystal 

4.51 6.05 B: hi this is rachael 

8.21 10.47 B: so which do you think are the worst 

9.93 11.60 A: mm i'd say 

11.31 12.22 B: [noise] 

11.87 13.99 A: depending on the person i'd say smoking 

13.81 17.86 B: [noise] [sigh] yeah i i think smoking too but it does depend on the person 'cause 

17.95 22.40 B: [sigh] i guess overeating could be worse if you were a diabetic [sigh] 

22.23 23.91 A: yeah 

23.54 27.16 B: but smoking i think affects others around you [noise] 

26.88 29.38 A: well alcohol could be really bad too 

29.46 30.44 B: yeah 

29.85 30.61 A: (( so )) 

31.03 35.14 B: but they didn't say like alcoholism did they they just said drinking alcohol 

33.96 35.86 A: (( they just said drinking alcohol )) 

35.64 36.94 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

36.69 40.03 A: but some people can become over excessive on that too 

39.64 52.64 B: [noise] yeah but i think probably smoking is the worst 'cause there are warnings out and [sigh] health violations you know health health codes and things like that like and um i don't know where are you from 

40.84 41.75 A: (( and just )) 

52.56 55.11 A: (( i uh i live in north dakota )) 

54.67 58.39 B: i live in south florida and in south florida we're doing um 

58.50 65.27 B: we've just passed a law saying that eating establishments [sigh] are not allowed to have [sigh] [noise] if they're um 

65.58 72.00 B: they're not allowed to have smoking sections any more uh like as of [sigh] i think it's september two thousand three [noise] [noise] 

72.18 74.46 A: mhm [lipsmack] we we just went through um 

75.25 77.11 A: this last year where 

77.25 79.26 A: i- in public um 

79.38 82.13 A: restaurants and stuff that they're not allowed to smoke 

82.30 83.39 B: yeah 

83.01 92.45 A: and um right now north dakota's try- um the rep- um republican side of our um house um is trying to ban 

92.77 95.10 A: um smoking in the state 

95.52 97.09 B: the whole state 

96.34 97.63 A: the whole state 

97.95 101.54 B: wow i mean i think that's really hard that's like prohibition 

101.36 102.31 A: yeah 

101.58 107.08 B: you know like i don't know i think that could cause it to be you know like and also that's hard because [sigh] 

107.35 115.68 B: th- that's kind of almost a uh federal law like the age limit i guess like the age limit with drinking [noise] like i know in canada it's nineteen 

111.65 112.97 A: mhm 

113.46 114.39 A: yeah 

115.67 117.99 A: yeah here it's twenty one 

117.77 119.64 B: yeah here it's twenty one [noise] 

119.57 121.34 A: but the it's like 

121.81 129.95 A: they're trying but see kids are smoking way earlier than that and so they're trying to just smash it out completely 

124.95 126.77 B: yeah 

129.88 131.15 B: (( wow [noise] )) 

130.33 134.62 A: and uh once well see if it becomes illegal they're going to want it more 

135.24 136.24 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

135.29 137.34 A: (( they've gone and illegalized it )) 

137.27 141.88 B: yeah that's true also it makes it like more appealing if it's something illegal 

141.90 151.28 A: mhm and right now they're like with other drugs it's like okay the only way that this is going to stop is if we make it legal 

151.24 153.83 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right or decriminalize it 

153.20 155.05 A: mhm 

154.23 156.11 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

155.86 163.13 A: but well it it seems like [mn] here it's smoking and drinking is like the worst out here 

163.77 165.28 A: (( because we have )) 

163.78 167.30 B: [noise] yeah we have a lot of smoking and drinking too 

167.37 176.64 B: like i think it's i also lived in north florida and i think it's worse in south florida i guess 'cause we're a big city and maybe there's more people and i notice it more but like 

170.09 170.73 A: (( mhm )) 

175.27 176.39 A: mhm 

176.86 184.55 B: even if you're outside i feel like you can't get away from it [sigh] if you're sitting outside and somebody walks [noise] by you you still smell the smoke and it still gets in your lungs [mn] 

184.29 189.05 A: yeah it will in north dakota it's [mn] 

186.09 186.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

189.19 196.10 A: the town i live in which is minor is probably a lot smaller than [laughter] your type of cities and it's 

194.03 194.98 B: yeah 

196.16 199.88 A: it depends on who's outside and so forth and 

200.13 204.95 A: not i don't think that the majority smokes i think most of 'em don't smoke 

205.11 210.65 A: but you still have problems with it like when you 

210.73 215.25 A: go out to a bar 'cause the bars still the bars are still allowing 

215.35 217.56 A: them to smoke in the bars 

216.96 219.47 B: [noise] right as long as it's a standalone bar 

219.29 222.76 A: yeah and as long as that there is circulation going on 

222.71 223.68 B: mhm 

223.08 229.07 A: with the um fans and stuff so okay for people who don't smoke 

229.36 237.07 A: but i found out that most people who smoke usually end up at the bars while the other ones are hiding outside 'cause they don't want to go in [laughter] 

235.81 237.28 B: (( [noise] right )) 

237.41 238.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

237.99 238.92 A: 'cause like 

238.26 242.50 B: how y- [sigh] how young do you think kids are starting to smoke up there [noise] 

239.27 240.13 A: go ahead 

242.49 245.12 A: up here um six seven 

243.44 244.33 B: mhm 

245.24 254.63 B: really i mean i would say like maybe high school which is like probably fourteen [sigh] um but also middle school which would probably be like eleven at the at the [noise] 

254.83 258.86 B: oldest i mean i could be completely wrong and that's just like my observation 

258.53 259.58 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

258.97 270.32 B: but we have like the laws have gotten more strict lately [noise] they'll send in the cops will hire kids [sigh] and they'll send them in to try to get to like see who's selling minors cigarettes and things like [noise] that 

270.00 277.25 A: yeah they do that here too [sigh] um it's like but in h- like my husband he started smoking 

277.42 279.77 A: when he was like six years old 

279.89 289.67 A: i've never touched a cigarette in my life [sigh] and my brothers they both smoke they started smoking when they were like i'd say ten nine 

279.99 280.92 B: wow 

289.53 293.84 B: yeah my grandmother started smoking when she was eleven but that was in the thirties 

293.58 295.25 A: mhm and 

294.33 300.82 B: and it's completely ruined h- i mean she has no kidney function any more she's on dialysis three times a week so 

300.79 314.87 A: mm yeah [sigh] well i'm trying to get my husband to quit quit because a lot of his problem is in his lungs [sigh] and in his metabolism in that with um smoking [sigh] you can damage a lot of those things so 

308.57 309.63 B: yeah 

314.67 317.94 A: we're trying to find ways that he can 

318.06 319.67 A: get back in or 

319.96 322.62 A: in order with his health and stuff 

322.47 331.37 B: [noise] yeah [noise] uh like i- i- if you stop now there's so much it's so much easier to combat whatever diseases may come of it 

331.11 338.30 A: yeah [lipsmack] but it's uh being being an older woman like uh in your nineties or whatever 

338.77 343.84 A: if you quit smoking at that age you could die within a couple of weeks or poss- w- 

342.87 345.26 B: [noise] right 'cause you're dependent on it 

345.04 349.37 A: well i had this gran- this um this um grandmother who 

350.07 360.80 A: smoked throughout her whole entire life and then two years before she died she quit smoking they found out afterwards that she had osteoporosis and so forth and her heart just like stopped on her 

361.32 367.97 A: and i just like okay [sigh] you know i would rather her [mn] stayed smoking if that was going to happen you know 

367.46 369.34 B: yeah 

368.20 370.32 A: (( she would have been somewhat heal- )) 

370.76 372.74 A: happy about it but 

373.81 378.41 A: she knew that she had to stop but i think helped 

376.65 382.88 B: yeah and i mean you know she didn't have anything else wrong that might have you know there's so many different factors 

382.50 386.95 A: yeah it plus it messes with all your system i have had 

386.99 394.27 A: many relatives die um because they've they smoked they quit [sigh] they found out they had cancer 

394.43 398.23 A: or whatnot and a couple of years later they were dead 

398.59 403.46 A: i used to i as a child i just stayed back from that i was like no [laughter] 

402.83 407.46 B: [noise] yeah don't even start if you can help it the easiest way to quit is to never start [laughter] 

406.88 407.89 A: yeah 

407.86 409.34 B: do you have any kids [noise] 

408.95 410.39 A: i have one daughter 

410.55 412.24 B: do you smoke around her 

412.16 419.31 A: um she's two years old and we and with my husband and stuff he doesn't i ma- make it that he does not smoke around her 

419.30 420.77 B: yeah 

420.16 424.13 A: so that [mn] and he's supposed to be smoking outside so 

424.67 429.17 A: that way she has no contact with the smelling it or anything 

429.05 429.99 B: yeah 

429.21 433.25 A: unless she's [mn] like co- she comes really close to him you know 

433.34 444.94 B: yeah well you got i grew up with my mom and my grandmother and a lot of their friends smoking and like they smoked inside the house a lot and i have asthma because of that but then later on they all they moved it outside 

446.15 451.83 B: um like we still allow people to smoke on our porch you know but not in the house or [noise] in the cars 

451.61 454.73 A: (( mhm i think um it's the case that )) 

452.46 453.16 B: um 

454.85 460.50 A: you see a lot more people smoking outside now because of the people who've decided not to smoke 

459.90 460.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

460.47 462.36 B: yeah 

461.66 463.00 A: and so you're 

463.42 469.71 A: 'cause they don't want um any diseases to happen or whatever and they've become more understanding 

469.82 471.13 A: (( i think like )) 

469.85 473.40 B: [noise] [noise] yeah especially like now they have all those truth commercials out 

473.10 474.29 A: mhm 

474.90 476.96 B: [noise] and i think those really help a lot 

476.85 478.65 A: yeah 

477.63 479.02 B: educate people 

480.21 483.54 A: yeah they have they have one here that says um 

480.41 481.27 B: but 

483.75 488.83 A: because of north d- they tested all of the north dakota kids and stuff 

488.85 496.68 A: and what they were doing and what they were not doing and so forth and you know most of the most of the kids lied on their tests on their quizzes 

491.99 492.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

495.23 496.23 B: mhm 

496.71 499.30 A: and the it one of them says um 

500.34 514.18 A: oh what is it it's if you um if you think that your peers are doing it you're wrong they're not doing it the census blah blah blah has has said that they're not doing it 

514.12 516.58 A: so that doesn't mean that you have to start doing 

517.25 518.11 A: (( it )) 

517.28 520.16 B: this is the thing that most kids said that they don't 

519.59 520.96 A: yeah 

520.55 522.34 B: so that [noise] you shouldn't do it either [noise] 

522.02 525.02 A: mhm and then like i was just like you know 

525.14 527.55 A: everybody knows that that whatever 

527.77 532.64 A: these kids did or took um on the test or whatever for the census 

532.74 534.82 A: most likely they lied 

535.25 542.12 A: because a lot of kids at nine and ten are smoking drinking 

542.21 544.64 A: um building um 

545.45 548.19 A: [mn] or doing pot and so forth 

548.76 550.77 A: um drinking or 

549.14 554.55 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i find that in south florida a lot of kids would rather smoke marijuana than cigarettes 

554.04 561.42 A: mhm well right now in north dakota we're having this big huge um thing going on where 

561.71 567.46 A: ford county where i live is like the biggest meth county so far 

567.28 568.64 B: mhm 

567.58 571.20 A: they've um shut down a lot of meth um 

572.46 575.90 A: oh meth uh labs and stuff like that 

576.64 582.25 A: and they even had to arrest a kid who was like sixteen years old because he got a um 

582.83 588.24 A: a thing of pot fr- um from the airport it was like a ten thousand dollar 

585.73 586.40 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

588.00 588.73 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

588.33 589.40 A: (( thing of pot it's )) 

589.47 590.33 B: wow 

589.97 593.27 A: just like okay [laughter] and they w- 

591.81 592.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

592.44 599.67 B: and you think an equal number [noise] of kids are doing drugs and smoking or are you think like smoking leads them to doing drugs [noise] 

599.09 599.90 A: well
