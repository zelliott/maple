115.21 126.20 A: yeah i don't see how they can do that now i mean [mn] i like money as much as the next person but some of that stuff they get asked to do i don't think i could do [noise] it [laughter] 

126.58 129.95 A: [sigh] some of the things they have to eat is just nasty [laughter] 

129.55 133.13 B: that's just totally gross the last time i watched they were eating the ostrich eggs 

132.84 135.55 A: (( [sigh] yeah yes it's nasty ))

147.21 149.64 A: [laughter] 

149.11 157.29 B: [sigh] yeah i i don't know i don't know about you i like i guess [mn] it's kind of like a vicarious thrill watching to see how bad somebody wants money huh 

156.60 169.94 A: [sigh] yeah i think that's why a lot of people watch it because it's just like everyday people on these shows and [sigh] you know they're not big movie stars and maybe just the general public can um relate better to that you know 

169.59 170.61 B: right 

169.91 177.62 A: because i can imagine myself on some of those shows but i don't think i could actually do it but i could imagine myself there 

172.93 173.99 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

176.49 181.49 B: yeah i can imagine myself the first day after the first day i'm it that's it [laughter] [laughter] 

179.47 183.29 A: (( [laughter] yeah that's right you know [laughter] go [laughter] )) 

183.27 187.36 B: i keep telling myself well maybe i'll do that i can get some money for my kids and

203.30 211.52 B: no no well i think the when the funniest was also one of the probably the dumbest is that um joe millionaire one have you have you seen that one at all 

209.48 210.66 A: mhm 

211.17 212.94 A: (( uh-uh uh-uh ))

214.78 215.99 A: mhm 

215.42 218.23 B: number one i don't think i don't think he's all that anyway but 

218.37 220.53 B: um i don't think he's all that great 

220.42 221.98 A: [laughter] 

221.19 229.48 B: but um he j- i watched it and these women on there just i don't know i mean it- it's kind of a sign of desperation when you go that far 

225.94 226.51 A: (( mm )) 

228.83 238.73 A: yeah [laughter] i think so too i really do i mean who's that desperate that [sigh] i mean what happened to the old-fashioned way of finding an a a a husband or a wife [laughter] 

238.09 242.43 B: [sigh] well th- these people don't want the husband they want the money that goes along with him 

241.08 251.71 A: the money yeah [lipsmack] i would do millionaire yeah but i i thought the catch of the show was he's not a millionaire yeah yeah 

244.81 245.37 B: (( [sigh] )) 

247.56 248.56 B: (( he he [sigh] )) 

248.74 255.67 B: exactly that is the catch [laughter] he's actually he actually grew right up rou- round here where i'm at mhm 

253.60 256.57 A: oh really oh cool 

255.98 263.59 B: and uh i don't know anything about him more than what what i've seen just on t._v. in the ve- you know few chances i've seen him but 

260.93 262.28 A: mhm 

263.00 264.61 A: mhm 

264.02 267.77 B: um i know he grew up around here he went to high school around here and everything 

265.70 266.83 A: mhm 

267.16 268.51 A: oh wow 

269.27 273.52 A: [sigh] i remember on the internet somebody was saying that they saw his mother in the bank or 

269.43 269.99 B: (( [cough] )) 

273.67 275.30 A: (( something [laughter] )) 

275.01 280.18 B: [sigh] yeah it's partly it i don't know i think his family still i don't know if his family still lives here or not 

279.62 281.18 A: mhm 

280.69 283.27 B: i don't know i don't i don't keep up with that [laughter] [sigh] 

282.52 286.58 A: [laughter] no uh-uh uh-uh too much other stuff to do [laughter] mm 

285.94 289.85 B: yeah well the only ones i really like though is i like survivor i like 

289.92 299.13 B: [mn] sometimes i mean some it [sigh] it's it can be a totally stupid and the people that are winning it drives me crazy because he just you can see what's happening 

298.64 300.38 A: right right 

300.26 305.64 B: and um amazing race is pretty neat because you i think that's probably one of the more real ones 

305.09 306.50 A: mhm 

306.25 314.13 B: because people just argue the couples just argue they don't c- after a while they don't care if they're on t._v. or not they're just going to let it all hang out [laughter] 

310.61 316.79 A: right they sure do yeah they do yeah but they have to work together if they really want to win 

316.47 325.59 B: right by the time they've gotten to the third part they they don't care anymore if they're on t._v. they don't care who's watching they're going to let the other partner have it whether they like [laughter] it or not [laughter] 

317.28 318.76 A: it is really good 

320.92 323.07 A: (( yeah no ))

330.81 332.29 A: yeah 

331.67 334.36 B: there's no way i'd go and do it but i think it would be fun 

332.48 338.21 A: [sigh] yeah [laughter] i don't think i'm physically fit enough to do any of those shows [laughter] 

338.10 340.80 B: (( oh i m- i might be able to handle some type of uh )) 

341.18 343.97 B: [sigh] brain part but that's about it [laughter]

465.30 467.94 A: yeah it is it is yeah

488.76 490.21 A: mhm 

489.56 494.05 B: i can i can do that i would probably end up telling somebody off with- withi- within two days though 

492.61 496.91 A: exactly yeah but i probably could be best at that too 

497.08 502.85 A: [sigh] because i could be in a houseful of people and just not even notice they're there yeah [laughter] 

500.07 502.06 B: [sigh] just as though you're there on your own 

502.53 505.14 B: i just grab my books and say the heck with everybody else 

504.15 509.64 A: mhm yeah i could do the same thing act like i'm there all by myself [laughter] 

509.18 521.65 B: but the thing is that they you can't do that though because they won't they won't let you do that people get upset when you do that you know why why she's keeping to herself she thinks that she's better than us no i just don't feeling like dealing with you leave me alone [laughter] 

511.36 512.17 A: (( mm mm )) 

513.00 516.74 A: (( [lipsmack] right they would just vote you out [laughter] ))

521.72 525.37 B: if i can tune out my kids i can tune you out too [laughter] 

524.47 529.10 A: [laughter] yeah you sound just like me [laughter] 

529.19 537.90 B: i don't have the patience for the stupidity i think that's that's the problem there's no way i could do it because i would i would go off on somebody it it would take it wouldn't take me long at all [mn] 

533.35 534.46 A: yeah 

535.31 536.54 A: (( yeah i would t- )) 

537.34 542.46 A: yeah 'cause some people act so [mn] you just have to say what is wrong with them [laughter] [sigh] 

542.32 547.15 B: mhm [sigh] that's like this last survivor you know i i watched this last one i didn't watch 

547.17 549.09 B: i don't think i watched the one before 

548.67 549.94 A: mhm

553.03 554.07 A: (( [laughter] )) 

554.16 561.37 B: [sigh] you get on p- on t._v. and you act totally stupid and you say you're not like this in real life so why are you acting like that now 

557.37 558.63 A: yeah 

559.25 560.64 A: right 

560.75 569.07 A: on t._v. right and it's not like they don't know they're on t._v. you'd think they would try to act a little more civilized [laughter] [sigh] 

566.80 580.27 B: exactly exactly i mean it i i i i don't know i mean i g- i g- i guess after a while you tend to forget but at the same time if you tend to forget and you keep [sigh] telling everybody you're not like this all the time you're not like this at home you're not like this at home 

577.94 579.09 A: (( mm right ))
