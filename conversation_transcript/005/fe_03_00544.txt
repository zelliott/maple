1.10 3.69 A: hi i'm karen [laughter] how are you 

2.66 4.64 B: hi i'm sarah how are you doin' 

3.82 6.18 A: (( [laughter] i'm fine this )) 

5.16 6.37 B: [laughter] 

6.59 8.50 A: is weird have you done it before 

7.75 9.54 B: no i have not 

8.97 13.82 A: uh no me either so first time [laughter] 

10.43 11.14 B: (( ahah )) 

11.26 14.23 B: [laughter] [sigh] sounds good 

13.86 15.30 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

14.70 16.42 B: so personal habits huh 

16.07 17.81 A: (( i don't )) 

16.98 18.94 B: there were a lot listed i don't [sigh] mm 

19.10 22.40 A: really know what i think is worst 

23.62 25.48 A: partly because 

25.92 27.09 A: um 

28.64 41.44 A: i i think all of them except gossiping um [sigh] well gossiping affects other people whereas all the others affect only the person themselves i think [sigh] 

31.99 32.95 B: gossiping 

35.84 36.75 B: mhm 

40.06 41.10 B: that's true 

41.73 45.55 B: so do you think it's worse to affect other people than it is to affect yourself 

47.01 48.26 A: yes [mn] 

47.78 49.06 B: mhm really 

49.38 50.64 A: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

50.45 54.38 B: but don't you think in some sense that by hurting yourself you're hurting others 

55.27 57.19 A: (( um [sigh] )) 

58.40 61.10 A: i'm not sure in w- what way do you mean 

61.14 69.08 B: um [sigh] i i just think like [sigh] um off the top of my head the smoking example um like you're hurting yourself 

69.12 73.93 B: in the sense that you know you're caus- you could cause yourself cancer or you could um 

73.97 75.77 B: pay a lot of money for it 

75.73 81.88 B: uh it could be like a very addictive habit um but at the same time you can be hurting others because one 

81.82 90.15 B: you know like as a non-smoker i hate walking behind people that smoke like i can't stand that [sigh] but then at the same time like if i had um 

86.78 87.98 A: mhm 

90.04 96.84 B: [lipsmack] like a friend or family member or a partner or someone that i was close to i wouldn't want them to be hurting themselves either 

97.14 101.54 B: so it kinda like goes both ways that you're hurting yourself but at the same time you're hurting others 

101.90 113.15 A: [sigh] well disregarding the fact of of y- o- of of a dislike for somebody else smoking because you don't like the smell of it [sigh] um 

113.36 114.36 A: that 

114.40 118.71 A: you know a family member of yours smokes it's kind of 

119.66 124.49 A: his choice her choice to to do that and um 

125.65 126.77 A: (( [lipsmack] it it )) 

126.93 128.05 A: then 

129.27 133.38 A: you're disliking that they're doing something that you don't want them to do 

133.28 134.22 B: mhm 

133.57 135.59 A: (( rather than [sigh] )) 

136.45 141.33 A: um their habit actually directly affecting you um there's 

141.57 143.70 A: [sigh] what you said about 

144.22 147.68 A: uh their smoke affecting you but um 

148.18 148.76 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

148.94 150.56 A: it's more 

151.05 153.35 A: really um 

153.97 156.83 A: [lipsmack] th- that becomes a a a losing of control 

156.61 157.79 B: mhm 

157.23 160.74 A: um of somebody else you know [sigh] where i- 

161.25 162.67 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

163.63 171.32 A: you know when if if you're gossiping about somebody you're actually entering directly into their life and being 

171.42 176.82 A: (( um [sigh] critical of them in some sense or another [sigh] )) 

176.92 189.41 A: um i i confess i'm saying this and i still gossip about [laughter] my friends you know [laughter] [sigh] but i just you know so much more [sigh] interactive um in a way that [sigh] 

181.10 183.92 B: (( [laughter] )) 

189.50 191.44 A: (( um you're )) 

192.87 195.61 A: choosing to to shape 

195.65 203.65 A: the value of somebody else by by the things you're saying [sigh] because you're not just thinking it to yourself you're sharing that with somebody else and 

203.59 212.26 A: that personal view so it's going backwards and forwards and [sigh] um a way of touching somebody else's life [sigh] 

212.12 219.17 A: and and also a third person and and then perhaps fourth or fifth you know that that gets a lot bigger than 

219.31 219.88 A: (( [sigh] )) 

220.95 223.11 A: (( you know say not exercising )) 

222.85 223.70 B: (( [sigh] mhm mm )) 

223.76 229.00 B: mhm yeah [lipsmack] i didn't think that exercising was [sigh] one of the ones that i'd find [sigh] um 

229.02 234.92 B: like the most disgusting or whatever it was that we were sus- like the personal habits that i would least like [sigh] because 

234.95 235.74 B: i mean 

235.57 236.67 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

235.76 240.19 B: (( i don't know it it it's their choice like you were saying with the smoking like )) 

239.44 241.33 A: mhm mhm 

240.64 251.39 B: i mean sure would i like people to exercise and be healthy yeah but [sigh] i mean people are going to do things to harm themselves and others um whether it's drinking or smoking or gossiping but 

250.63 252.12 A: mhm 

251.36 264.48 B: i guess that's just another one of those [sigh] things i don't i think i criticize as the top one because lots of people are just i mean there are lots of people that don't enjoy exercising and they do it for the wrong reasons like they might not even enjoy the activity but 

264.33 272.73 B: they're trying to fit like social norms and you know being a certain figure or size or something like that and it's not 

267.10 268.15 A: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

272.26 281.26 A: that's very true they're they're giving in to pressure uh by the media and and um that that's not really a good thing [sigh] um 

281.07 288.35 A: in a wider sense um [sigh] the lack i mean i i exercise a lot and i [laughter] i enjoy it 

287.89 288.70 B: (( mhm mhm mm )) 

289.01 293.97 A: but [sigh] in a in a wider sense uh coming from the country i come from it 

294.80 301.47 A: a lack of exercise is going to shorten your life so [sigh] um because 

302.00 307.83 A: i- i- if you're an unexercised heart you're an unhealthier one than [laughter] than than than and exercised one 

305.90 306.76 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

308.05 310.24 A: so um 

310.13 314.50 A: [lipsmack] where we have socialized medicine that's paid for 

314.33 325.59 A: um [sigh] out of everybody's taxes then [sigh] the people that don't exercise are actually um [sigh] going to be using up more of my taxes 

325.36 326.24 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

325.38 336.17 A: (( on um medical care for example [laughter] [sigh] because they're they are not going to do that and i think what you were saying about uh having um )) 

327.01 328.35 B: exactly [laughter] 

328.78 330.41 B: yeah i can see that 

336.29 347.04 A: you know say a member of your family smoking a member of your family that wasn't exercising is then going to cause somebody else worries so i suppose [sigh] fr- from that point of view there's um 

342.88 343.69 B: mhm 

347.71 348.35 A: (( [mn] )) 

349.18 350.81 A: it's worse 

350.53 351.61 B: mhm 

350.98 356.89 A: or it's it's a it's not such a good thing but really i'm so into personal choice [laughter] 

356.47 357.56 B: mhm 

356.84 368.12 A: i'd i'd rather people choose whether they [sigh] uh they're going to shorten their life by four or five years and let's face it you shorten the [sigh] worst end of your life it's not the best end of your life now do you [sigh] 

366.35 367.87 B: mhm 

368.67 378.72 B: yes i i i often talk with 'cause i work with children and and i discovered that you know they smoke or they drink and often like you know just from my perspective i just try to 

371.91 372.81 A: (( mhm )) 

378.77 386.93 B: allow them to see where i'm coming from [sigh] and how much i enjoy life and i'm and i know like there are facts that you know if you smoke you're going to decrease your life or 

380.76 382.61 A: mhm 

387.11 393.32 B: [sigh] if you don't exercise you're not going to be as healthy and like trying to get youths to understand that [sigh] um 

393.56 397.23 B: i mean maybe it's just my flaw and i see like 

393.77 396.09 A: (( mhm )) 

397.35 399.29 B: not just the here and the now 

399.26 400.43 A: mhm 

399.40 407.03 B: and i think lots of youths these days think that you know it's right now or it's never going to happen and they don't care so much about the consequences later 

404.50 405.48 A: mhm 

406.85 412.42 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] yeah [lipsmack] but i think that's youth of all ages um i think we're 

410.57 411.67 B: mhm 

413.10 414.13 A: (( [mn] e- )) 

414.24 416.70 A: everybody goes through that uh 

416.77 421.89 A: very um present and only in the in the now um 

421.70 434.33 A: stage of of your life but [sigh] um i think i think you're right w- w- we act by example and try and persuade others to to to [sigh] um and look at the benefits but 

423.15 424.14 B: mhm 

434.46 435.49 A: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

436.30 437.64 A: (( in the end )) 

437.69 439.07 A: it is 

439.29 445.68 A: i suppose totally about personal choice and that if you inform people [sigh] um 

445.75 449.46 A: then they have a choice so what you were saying that you do 

449.78 452.61 A: um then i think that's um 

452.60 453.24 A: (( [mn] )) 

453.12 465.19 A: an important thing to give somebody a wider choice perhaps if they grew up in a family that never exercised or where everybody smokes then [sigh] they don't have a choice um and you'll 

461.65 462.85 B: (( mhm mhm mhm thank you )) 

465.01 476.32 A: wipe they don't have a model an idea um it doesn't occur to them that that's a a choice particularly that they can take so i think you're doing a a good thing 

476.55 479.41 A: in exposing people to things 

480.41 482.30 B: [sigh] yeah i i find it um 

483.08 490.40 B: that i had some of them thinking i was going on one direction but i i lost it [laughter] but just about like 

488.10 488.90 A: (( like that )) 

490.63 494.05 B: it it's hard to get to the point where i mean 

491.64 493.30 A: (( mm [laughter] mhm )) 

494.38 498.77 B: i think at times people think you know their way's the right way it's the only way 

499.46 501.48 B: and when people are in um 

501.83 514.35 B: ex- like trying things or doing things that [sigh] in your eyes you see as wrong that um you know they're harmful to either themselves or others and it's difficult to 

507.34 508.35 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

515.07 517.97 B: let them make their own decisions 

518.00 529.43 B: because you have your own beliefs that you know you're you know you're you're doing this to yourself you're doing this to others [sigh] you know you try to make improvements but and th- and it's the person's individual choice and that's like so difficult to give up but mm 

529.94 544.13 A: [lipsmack] yeah that's what every parent has to face when their children grow up isn't it like their [sigh] decision to go as they please but my mum still tells me [laughter] [laughter] and she's seventy [sigh] 

539.20 541.47 B: [laughter] 

543.78 544.87 B: wow 

544.25 549.35 A: um yeah well that means that i'm older too um so 

547.25 548.32 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

549.61 551.23 A: but i i think 

551.71 555.79 A: going back to the total question of what they 

555.92 558.69 A: (( asked us to discuss was there another one [sigh] )) 

558.56 562.29 B: um [lipsmack] obsessive eating maybe 

562.48 563.90 B: something about eating 

563.90 565.87 A: yeah 

564.59 570.01 B: i think that was 'cause i think it was along the like same lines as exercise eating alcohol 

570.48 573.02 A: [sigh] that's right yeah 

570.91 574.38 B: smoking and gossiping that i can remember [laughter] 

574.16 575.27 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

574.83 576.88 B: oh and lying h- was lying one 

576.60 577.66 A: (( lying )) 

576.97 579.79 B: um no maybe it was gossiping maybe that's the 

579.18 582.94 A: (( gossiping yeah i think that was the only different [sigh] um [sigh] )) 

585.43 586.81 A: (( i suppose [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

587.67 590.75 A: (( yeah overeating hm [sigh] )) 

592.82 599.89 A: i mean how much effect can that have on somebody else again it goes back to that well if it's a member of your family and they going to die of it you know 

599.38 599.89 B: (( [laughter] mhm ))
