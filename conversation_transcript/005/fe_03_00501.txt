186.40 187.32 B: yeah 

187.74 189.21 B: do you tend to take like ah 

188.46 189.11 A: deal with it 

189.42 192.60 B: echinacea or anything like that i tried that once you know 

191.95 193.12 A: oh you did 

192.71 201.48 B: yeah i did for like a w- like a couple of months but then when i stopped taking them i got sick i was like oh god and it tasted really nasty i don't know if you was ever 

193.33 193.83 A: is that 

197.32 199.42 A: oh really wow that's interesting 

200.99 203.11 A: yeah no i haven't taken it 

201.68 211.06 B: hadn't yeah any cough drops or anything you take i take like ludens and halls and stuff oh gosh i don't know what else let's see 

205.11 205.69 A: yeah 

206.95 207.49 A: uh 

208.29 208.79 A: yeah 

210.60 214.69 A: yeah i do know like that well the people that i tend to see that get sick 

211.20 211.75 B: huh 

214.80 222.42 A: fairly often it seems like they are always on medication and you know like you said as soon as the go of the medicine they get sick again 

215.81 216.33 B: uh 

218.71 219.48 B: oh really 

220.28 220.82 B: uh 

222.17 223.32 B: yeah but then 

222.67 227.92 A: that's what i maybe why you know i try and stay away from medicine all together because you don't wanna stay dependent on it 

225.63 226.18 B: uh-huh 

228.36 231.33 B: so when you're sick you don't take anything you know haven't like even when if sucks 

230.70 232.86 A: i mean not unless it's real bad 

232.97 233.61 B: uh 

233.01 236.16 A: i tend to just try and rest as much as possible and 

236.35 236.95 A: um 

237.61 239.07 A: yeah make sure i'm comfortable 

239.28 244.53 B: yeah same here i get coughing and that's about it usually that's like a horror when you get it but 

243.93 245.06 A: right yeah 

244.71 256.55 B: drink lots of fluids they usually tell you sometimes just drink lots of fluids it will go away unless it's like a bad fever you know or something like that but anybody in your household you know you have people in your house who get sick 

248.25 248.70 A: right 

251.09 251.66 A: uh 

258.46 261.68 A: yeah i i just don't seem to catch things 

259.22 259.89 B: yeah 

261.90 262.19 B: oh 

262.17 265.89 A: from people that often i guess obviously i'm lucky but ah 

263.68 264.21 B: uh 

269.31 270.29 A: oh really 

271.44 271.86 A: yeah

290.23 290.78 A: um 

290.90 301.03 A: so yeah they always recommend we get flue shots and our coach is really insistent that if anybody is sick to you know to stay home and get better before we could back in so the whole team doesn't get sick and 

300.86 301.26 B: uh 

301.51 303.87 A: um so yeah they are concerned about stuff like that
