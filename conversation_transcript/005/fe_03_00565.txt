38.77 40.09 B: uh i liked survivor 

40.43 41.14 A: you like it 

41.33 41.76 B: yeah 

42.13 42.54 B: think it 

42.80 43.55 B: you know it 

44.10 45.03 B: we learn from 

45.35 46.37 B: survivor and 

46.60 47.26 B: you know we 

47.45 48.27 B: watch it and 

48.92 51.35 B: uh you know the different areas that they go to and 

51.55 53.10 B: learn the culture and so forth 

54.40 56.06 A: yeah that is right uh 

56.45 59.38 A: that is a good part about it but i don't think it's 

60.01 64.97 A: i mean it it's all set up so it's not really reality but 

65.43 67.63 A: yeah of course there is an element of 

68.04 68.76 A: you know some 

69.69 72.41 A: uh kind of surprises for the participants 

72.65 73.06 B: right 

73.21 75.75 A: do you also think that the show is like uh 

76.28 81.21 A: you know blind date and (( )) date and stuff like that those dating shows 

81.30 82.04 A: also 

82.77 83.30 A: uh 

83.39 84.98 A: could be classified as uh 

85.32 86.44 A: reality shows 

87.41 89.66 B: um i think those are more um 

89.98 90.48 B: you know 

90.77 95.91 B: well i think they could be but i think they're more entertaining than anything else i think it's more of a 

96.43 99.63 B: um entertainment show for a single person to 

99.82 101.65 B: to watch j- just to see what 

101.75 103.72 B: you know goes on on a different date 

104.66 107.68 B: i don't think it's r- reality i think it's more entertainment 

108.53 119.39 A: okay that's what you think i think that's also some kind of um there's always some kind of entertainment and some kind of learning depending on what you are looking for i mean if you are more of uh 

120.71 122.52 A: uh hm you know um 

123.61 124.80 A: know some kind hm 

125.39 130.47 A: thrill seeking type than you would probably go for a something a survivor show 

131.55 137.80 A: or if you uh more into like police chase and all than you like to see cops and you know 

138.17 138.64 B: right 

138.36 138.96 A: wild as 

139.08 140.52 A: police police videos 

140.62 141.37 A: and um 

141.85 142.27 B: uh-huh 

142.17 148.72 A: on the other hand of spectrum if you're really you know easy going kind of person than you probably like to see how guys and girls 

149.07 150.12 A: interact and what 

151.42 155.86 A: uh what's entertaining about it and you know what uh mistakes they made so 

155.96 156.46 B: right

164.62 167.67 B: um you know kind of way out there and some of the 

167.87 171.09 B: the stunts that they do on that show and i think that

307.95 308.46 B: from 

308.63 308.99 B: the
