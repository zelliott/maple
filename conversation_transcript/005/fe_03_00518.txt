58.57 60.32 A: people i think gossip of sex 

61.21 65.64 A: really has an effect on the entire community and society i think 

66.26 70.40 B: i think you're right but i think also the worse part about it is it's just 

71.40 71.75 B: it gets 

71.98 72.48 B: (( )) 

73.63 74.78 B: spread out that 

75.51 77.13 B: it's just unreal how 

77.51 78.27 B: they don't 

79.08 81.15 B: people don't think what they're saying and then 

82.63 87.06 A: i also think that when people get in the habit of gossip i think it's very difficult 

87.46 89.30 A: to have a conversation and not 

89.55 89.99 A: gossip 

90.13 93.96 A: it's very difficult to have a conversation without talking about somebody else 

94.47 95.36 A: very hard to do 

95.64 96.33 B: very 

96.55 101.38 B: very hard to do people don't even realize it i think 

101.67 103.69 B: when they say things and then 

102.82 104.73 A: no i think we i think we sure don't 

105.32 107.47 A: very easy to talk about everybody else 

108.41 111.27 A: and uh not the real issues i think that's true 

113.12 115.97 B: it does say here in the email um 

116.18 118.76 B: provide a wide variety conversation keep 

119.22 121.69 B: the conversation going in a meaningful way 

121.77 122.36 A: okay 

122.97 124.51 A: i think that um 

125.04 126.10 A: i think that 

126.33 131.60 A: gossiping is something that we learn to do from the time that we're children and i think it's reinforced 

131.97 136.19 A: in our families and by you know in our schools and certainly 

136.30 138.61 A: when i was a little girl that's all that girls did 

139.42 141.33 A: and um in the work place 

142.30 146.67 A: uh i think that it's um it's encouraged and i think that it's very hurtful 

147.70 148.21 B: yeah 

148.85 155.03 A: because i think that when we make a habit of it we really start to confuse what's rumor and what's true 

148.94 149.44 B: very 

155.67 161.92 B: exactly people just have no idea what what they are saying in the end how it 

162.04 163.55 B: effects other people and 

164.26 167.63 B: i think they just do it and tha- don't even know they did it 

167.47 173.44 A: i think that's true i think also that it becomes a real habit and we're not even aware that we do it 

174.16 178.33 A: and yet when we know that somebody's doing it about us it's very hurtful 

178.92 179.90 B: exactly 

180.81 181.65 B: i know ah 

181.93 182.54 B: it hurt 

182.81 184.52 B: especially what seems 

184.63 185.19 B: to me 

185.70 186.17 B: um 

186.53 188.58 B: so unbelievably much 

189.27 191.23 B: to older people 

191.34 192.02 B: especially 

191.56 192.73 A: oh absolutely 

192.73 196.09 B: because they for whatever reasons feel like it is 

196.40 197.73 B: so hurtful 

197.55 198.58 A: how old are you sandy 

199.00 199.93 B: i'm thirty eight 

199.86 201.46 A: ah i'm fifty three 

201.87 202.62 B: oh wow 

202.51 210.08 A: i think also it's probably easier to stop smoking or to stop drinking or stop overeating i forget what the other choices were 

210.45 212.02 A: than it is to stop gossiping 

212.55 213.70 B: oh i agree 

214.27 218.66 B: cause gossiping is sort of like taking the name of every person 

219.04 227.64 B: that you've ever known right out of your mind as far as not being never to to (( )) mention them in a bad way which is 

226.16 226.76 A: mhm 

226.91 231.34 A: i think we even do it about strangers like you're if you're at the supermarket and you're 

232.06 237.15 A: at the deli counter and somebody's acting weird you'll look at a total stranger and make a face at you know 

237.62 238.17 B: right 

238.03 241.22 A: at the other person so i think it's something that we don't even know we do 

241.73 242.89 B: oh i agree 

243.63 244.59 B: just um 

246.02 246.46 B: just 

247.25 248.89 B: unbelievable how we 

250.10 253.29 B: do so much of it an- and we're totally unaware 

253.67 255.12 A: i think also that we're 

255.23 258.83 A: we're not really cognizant of how much words hurt 

259.94 260.64 B: you're right 

260.05 265.77 A: you know like if you're a child and you're told that um you're never going to amount to anything 

266.47 268.72 A: or you're a bad person 

268.90 269.57 A: or 

270.82 271.28 A: you know 

271.64 280.39 A: you're not cared about i think it totally cripples you for the rest of your life so i don't think th- i think that words are far more hurtful 

280.58 282.48 A: than even lung cancer you know 

283.16 283.77 B: right 

284.30 289.82 A: i think that words really damage us for- forever i think that they leave a hole in your heart forever 

290.42 291.14 A: whereas if you 

291.53 294.92 A: if you get cancer from smoking you can go have surgery and you can 

295.03 300.98 A: possibly be cured whereas if you've heard bad words about yourself from the time you're very young 

301.27 304.82 A: you don't ever there's no way to ever really heal from that i think 

305.25 306.47 B: well if if 

306.84 309.97 B: if you are able to heal from uh from it 

310.14 313.92 B: it's very minute amount so to speak versus 

312.29 312.76 A: right 

314.60 316.39 B: the um way that 

317.53 328.24 B: when you are hit or have cancer or are hurt physically in some other way whether it actually effects you currently or not 

329.21 333.86 B: it you usually heal from it to a degree that's far better than 

334.07 336.01 B: what a word can do to you 

335.37 342.26 A: yeah can you think of a time in your life where um where you were really hurt by gossip i can think of so many in mine 

342.68 345.07 B: very very very many most 

345.17 349.93 B: time it's something i said and my mother told me 

350.04 357.26 B: how dare you and i was just like i had no idea it effected you in that way 

351.22 351.75 A: uh-huh 

357.08 357.81 A: uh-huh 

357.74 361.88 B: or that it bother you because it's also uh um 

362.72 366.19 B: a way that people feel about how they are respected 

366.22 366.66 A: right 

367.25 374.67 B: and they just don't appreciate other people saying things that even have nothing to do with them except for the fact that it made 

374.78 376.03 B: they may be related 

376.11 376.55 A: right 

377.10 377.69 B: and it 

377.87 386.77 B: so um difficult that's why it said i think a lot of times uh um uh the older you are the harder it is for you to forgive 

386.63 387.54 A: oh definitely 

387.64 389.16 B: and or 

389.25 390.22 B: tolerate 

390.90 392.91 B: somebody saying something about 

393.02 393.67 B: someone 

394.40 396.36 B: that you know effects you 

396.90 399.78 B: whether you love them or just are neighbors with them 

400.17 400.54 A: right 

401.15 403.35 B: and it's so very hard i think 

403.04 405.79 A: and then it's really hard if you're the target of 

405.95 412.50 A: whether conspiracy as misinformation if there's rumors spent spread about you that have no basis in fact 

413.18 417.30 A: and like a mob mentality takes over where the more people that hear it the 

417.43 423.97 A: more impossible it is to straighten it out and try to unravel it and prove to people that what was said wasn't true 

424.55 425.70 B: exactly 

425.52 428.42 A: (( )) i a lot of that happens on on the internet 

428.80 429.74 B: i agree 

429.35 433.02 A: oh my god i've never seen so many bullies and mean people on the internet 

433.17 433.90 A: gossips 

434.20 434.96 A: (( )) 

434.22 434.74 B: (( )) 

435.39 438.73 B: i i agree totally and people um 

439.04 442.59 B: i think a lot of people just don't realize that 

442.76 446.95 B: if they don't allow themselves to be effected they can walk away 

447.00 447.45 A: right 

447.70 448.87 B: and um 

449.43 452.61 B: people might still gossip about them in the end but 

453.32 456.43 B: it doesn't have to hurt them personally 

456.27 456.75 A: right 

457.13 458.28 B: i i suppose if 

458.42 460.43 B: if they talk to the person that was 

460.54 465.80 B: being told things about them or whatever that could come back and still hurt them 

466.09 467.94 B: which is why it's so 

466.13 466.77 A: right 

468.81 471.57 B: so very hurtful in the end people don't 

471.81 474.14 B: have any idea what they're doing 

474.68 478.34 A: i don't think i've ever met anybody that's not guilty of gossiping 

479.19 483.13 B: oh i don't think so either because i think there's just no way you can 

483.66 485.21 B: um possibly 

486.06 487.91 B: not do it unless you 

488.39 490.36 B: completely and fully just 

491.18 492.51 B: refrain from 

492.63 494.16 B: speaking of others 

493.92 495.71 A: i don't know maybe do you have kids 

495.75 496.56 B: yes i do 

496.20 499.89 A: i i don't maybe like really young kids don't do it do they 

503.45 505.93 B: where young and old enough to just 

506.00 511.42 B: talk they could talk about other people and i'll tell you uh 

511.70 514.96 B: i have one that's ten now and being the youngest 

515.42 519.77 B: and she still will talk about other people and not realize how 

520.11 523.63 B: detrimental her words are about other people and she 

523.94 528.12 B: definitely does not like it when other people talk about her 

527.51 530.53 A: yeah exactly and i don't think women are worse than men 

530.74 536.11 B: i don't either but i think they like to make us believe that women are 

534.12 535.22 A: yeah definitely 

535.65 539.93 A: i mean i think men gossip as much as women absolutely maybe more 

540.56 541.41 B: could be 

541.54 542.26 B: at least 

542.45 545.41 B: there's got to be a fifty fifty chance huh 

545.20 549.85 A: yeah exactly but i don't think they admit it as readily at least women admit it 

550.47 550.98 B: well 

551.30 552.11 B: exactly 

552.41 553.34 B: i mean 

553.18 557.48 A: and i wonder why we feel satisfied when we're gossiping i wonder why that is 

557.62 559.73 A: maybe it makes us feel popular or something
