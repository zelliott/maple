58.20 63.58 B: i guess searching certain places that they thought they were making um weapons of mass destruction 

63.85 64.82 A: mhm 

64.65 65.50 B: and um 

66.05 67.86 B: i think the first couple times 

69.42 69.81 B: i guess 

70.06 70.79 B: saddam 

71.85 73.90 B: saddam i forget what the rest of the name is 

74.54 74.98 B: um 

75.83 76.92 B: wouldn't let them go 

77.43 78.93 B: and then i guess when 

79.67 81.12 B: we threatened to go over there 

81.42 83.18 B: didn't he decide to let them go but then 

84.23 87.87 B: giving them a hard time and wouldn't let them search certain places or something 

88.44 89.61 A: right 

89.04 91.02 B: and that's well i think 

92.62 95.31 B: if they keep getting the run around that they should go over there 

98.12 98.56 B: and 

99.43 100.77 B: bomb a few places 

102.27 111.94 A: well i think it's important because of the fact that you know the u._s. has had so many threats and actually when they had nine one one happen 

112.41 120.83 A: i think that that made it more important for us to get involved in other countries' things that are happening with wars because they're basically 

121.34 122.85 A: attacking us also 

123.19 124.76 A: you know when you think about it 

127.22 127.76 B: true 

128.76 130.90 B: fact well i think they're affecting our way of life 

131.19 141.15 A: mhm i mean -cause you figure i mean look at the way the airports are now being you know more secure trying to be more secure with people being 

141.35 142.21 A: um 

142.88 144.57 A: i don't know what you call it like 

145.56 147.55 A: inspected more than they used to be 

147.31 147.88 B: mhm 

148.15 152.23 A: you know -cause now you can't even go see someone off at the airport 

152.06 152.66 B: that's right 

159.64 164.24 A: bombing and things coming in and out that shouldn't you know if they do more of that maybe 

164.77 165.14 B: yeah 

165.88 167.53 B: that's i think that's a good factor 

167.68 170.04 B: but um also like the gas gas is going up 

172.00 172.26 B: the 

172.43 173.13 B: we could 

173.26 174.88 B: the majority of our gas from 

175.21 175.85 B: over there 

177.67 184.48 B: and um like to travel and stuff gas the um airline tickets are going to cost more because the airline is going to have to pay for the ticket 

184.74 185.50 A: mhm 

188.24 189.38 B: or just this you know to 

189.66 191.20 B: drive and travel somewhere 

197.78 203.99 A: and one thing we don't want is anything else happening in the united states because what happened in new york was bad 

206.97 207.39 B: yeah 

208.06 210.40 B: but i don't think that had anything to do with him 

210.99 212.84 A: well you never know i mean they 

212.32 213.74 B: well it could be but 

230.09 231.58 B: well i mean well eventually um 

232.76 234.21 B: get them to agree 

235.37 238.59 B: well i think previously they were supposed to have agreed not to make any 

239.26 241.78 B: weapons of mass destruction 

240.91 241.78 A: mhm 

242.38 249.31 A: that's why it's important that the president gets involved too and goes and you know has all these peace talks and stuff like that 

251.66 253.41 A: because i think that would help something 

254.92 255.44 B: mhm 

257.29 258.21 B: but if um 

261.23 268.07 B: i mean i think they've tri- well i'm not sure but i would assume they have tried it before they tried to send troops over there because they've been 

268.60 269.81 B: like non compliant 

270.19 273.28 B: or by requests and stuff 

272.30 273.16 A: mhm 

273.67 277.27 A: no that's probably one of the reasons they're sending more troops out there to be careful 

279.39 281.23 B: yeah but i mean i hear they're sending them out 

281.67 283.12 B: within the next six months 

286.79 294.25 A: -cause i was watching the news yesterday and today and it looked like they were sending more um guys out from indiana 

294.44 296.18 A: and places like that 

296.49 297.55 A: to go out that way 

299.22 299.65 B: yeah 

300.48 304.14 A: which is good because they do need to have you know make sure they have enough troops 

305.42 305.82 B: yeah 

306.13 308.09 B: they w- i ha- heard they were the- 

309.02 310.65 B: they might do a draft 

311.15 311.90 B: i don't know though 

312.61 313.86 B: wonder if that's a good idea 

314.44 321.48 A: well hopefully they don't go that far because usually there's enough young people that you know want to get involved 

321.95 324.76 A: or at least hopefully they don't have to go that way to the draft 

326.60 326.96 B: hm mm 

334.55 339.05 A: and hopefully they can solve the problems without having to send too many troops out 

340.79 344.29 B: well from what i understand um from what i understand um 

345.11 345.88 B: i think for the 

345.98 348.51 B: gulf war they sent a lot of air troops in 

348.82 349.64 A: mhm 

350.16 352.90 B: and for this one there is going to be more of a ground war 

353.98 356.41 B: so i think there will probably be more casualties on 

357.04 358.18 B: the american side 

358.45 360.06 B: opposed to the gulf war 

360.28 361.55 A: mhm 

362.56 365.96 A: well hopefully aren't there won't be more casualties but 

366.08 373.06 A: that's a bad part about war and you know when they're fighting and everything you never know what's going to happen 

374.64 375.10 B: sure 

375.15 380.33 A: and iraq lately has been in the news a lot so it's hard to tell 

380.82 384.03 A: -cause it seems like they don't want to um 

385.56 390.49 A: i don't know what you call it you know maybe let up on you know how much they use arms and stuff 

390.73 391.23 B: mhm 

393.26 394.41 B: yeah and i hope that uh 

395.46 396.89 B: we don't send troops over there 

397.51 399.58 B: to discover they do have a weapon 

400.32 401.49 B: and w- you know as soon as 

401.69 402.88 B: our troops land there 

403.21 404.66 B: then they launch the weapon 

404.84 405.62 B: over here 

408.78 411.74 B: you know um to like a major city or something 

411.05 412.36 A: mhm 

416.42 419.45 B: so i i guess i guess the troops going over there would be effective 

420.27 421.26 B: if they hurry up 

422.25 424.08 B: and find out where the weapons are 

424.46 425.43 A: right 

426.03 429.49 A: and i think the u._s. you know should do everything they can to try and keep 

429.63 432.43 A: the fighting down to a minimum 

433.26 435.86 A: you know so that hopefully there aren't as many casualties 

436.39 436.72 B: yes 

437.67 438.65 B: or why don't uh 

438.91 440.03 B: uh say use more 

441.87 442.54 B: like air 

442.73 445.06 B: support opposed to ground troops 

442.79 443.45 A: mhm 

452.09 458.13 A: oh this is an interesting topic i was in the army before long long time ago 

458.80 459.61 B: oh okay 

459.66 465.76 A: so i have a little bit experience but not in war time this was you know peace time 

465.96 466.70 B: oh okay 

466.72 468.17 A: so 

468.64 475.52 A: hopefully the you know they don't have too many casualties if they do have to actually fight when they go out 

475.78 481.39 A: because on the news it seemed like the people going out weren't sure 

481.49 488.49 A: where they were going to go and how long they'd be and that's the bad part about things like this when they're deployed they don't know how long it's going to be 

488.65 489.09 B: right 

489.72 490.08 B: right 

490.93 493.17 B: and to think they just did the um 

495.62 501.88 B: they implemented something where um military people can't get out the military if they're supposed to get out right now 

502.08 502.76 A: mhm 

502.54 503.39 B: they can't get out 

504.15 505.65 B: they're just keeping them until 

505.75 506.07 B: they 

506.85 508.82 B: -til they feel it's time for them to get out 

509.16 512.37 A: mm well that's possible because i know they have 

512.62 520.81 A: usually three or four years that they sign up for but then then there's also the ones in the reserve when they never know when they're going to be called 

520.97 521.34 B: right 

521.61 522.71 A: they have regular jobs 

524.36 527.57 A: and it seemed like they were calling out a lot of the reserve people 

530.33 532.36 B: yeah yeah i heard about that too 

533.02 535.58 A: but that you know they have to be safe so whether it's 

535.68 540.51 A: taking the regular people or taking the reservists just so they have enough people 

538.92 539.31 B: (( i mean that )) 

540.47 544.30 B: (( you do have other reservists you can and then )) 

542.85 543.64 A: mhm 

545.86 546.16 B: get 

546.91 547.86 B: (( to )) i mean 

549.30 553.84 B: (( af )) if it calls for a draft if for some reason there's not that many people 

556.00 557.06 B: mm so be it 

557.69 559.35 B: i mean -at we we have to pr- 

559.48 561.20 B: protect america 

560.57 561.87 A: right 

563.99 566.37 A: and it's good that they get involved
