112.74 115.89 B: [sigh] much of it or in it uh [sigh] 

116.09 119.70 B: i don't it just doesn't s- it's hard to believe that's real life 

116.20 117.22 A: to watch 

119.36 120.85 A: (( yeah they uh )) 

119.90 124.01 B: i mean i i can't see people acting the way some of them act 

123.11 132.03 A: [sigh] that's true too but [laughter] they uh that's why i don't like to watch those i like to watch where they're forced to interact and that like the you know locked in a house 

131.83 133.92 B: (( [mn] [noise] mhm )) 

132.07 136.33 A: or you know stuck out where they're stuck you know on the island or whatever but 

134.35 138.11 B: ha [noise] [laughter] you want to see 'em suffer [laughter] 

137.10 148.28 A: and that well you know if if they're forced to be around each other like that then you know they [mn] their defenses are down i guess [laughter] but uh for what it's worth anyway for however real it may be but 

147.29 151.12 B: [noise] [noise] yeah oh i g- i guess it's definitely real i mean but i [sigh] 

151.31 155.48 B: i guess i think everybody's just putting on a front or making a show out of it uh 

155.18 157.13 A: mhm yeah 

156.03 158.98 B: uh just knowing they're on camera or whatever [noise] 

158.82 160.08 A: that's true too 

159.42 164.40 B: it it it's not the way i consider or what i would consider a thing about as far as uh 

164.68 167.67 B: [sigh] real real life 

166.66 177.89 A: well those are the main two that i keep up with um and i only you know i i got into the big brother kind of late but i've been [mn] watching the the survivor for quite a long while but the um 

174.43 175.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

178.10 179.77 A: (( [sigh] normally ))

193.99 195.64 B: [sigh] some of their inner 

195.66 205.25 B: [mn] inner body shots and whatever uh are just are little unnecessary [sigh] i think a lot of t._v. nowadays and and a lot of movies is just a lot of uh 

200.31 201.59 A: (( yeah [noise] a )) 

204.93 206.48 A: little further [laughter] 

205.70 209.24 B: unnecessary yeah yeah ah 

207.44 217.88 A: exactly yeah they [sigh] i mean i i'm interested in stuff like you know archeology and fossils and things and also you know i'm a probably a little more interested in the [sigh] the forensic 

216.02 218.74 B: (( mhm )) 

217.80 223.53 A: stuff maybe probably than you are [laughter] but i really don't like all of the indepth

455.09 456.44 A: (( yeah they are )) 

455.59 457.32 B: and not much of those

485.31 493.74 A: yeah nei- neither have i i i just uh i've caught a few of 'em in the last few days there's been a couple that um you know each night 

493.26 494.89 B: mhm 

493.89 499.82 A: the uh and i don't know if uh american idol it doesn't qualify as a reality show i don't suppose or does it i 

498.34 504.91 B: i w- i i wouldn't think so well [sigh] you don't know know i i guess it's you know it's [sigh] 

500.88 501.86 A: (( don't know )) 

504.43 506.45 A: real people doing something 

505.10 519.77 B: it's real people it's real current but uh it it's not necessarily reality uh t._v. [lipsmack] but uh and the only time i think i ever planned or wanted to watch one of those shows was the last episode of uh [sigh] of the bachelor uh 

510.76 511.91 A: (( exactly mhm )) 

520.48 523.22 A: just to see who he picked [laughter] i 

520.70 525.16 B: and yeah just to see who he who he actually ended up picking and uh 

525.72 528.72 A: (( don't know that s- that one's a little farfetched for me )) 

525.81 526.52 B: (( that's )) 

527.82 532.63 B: [lipsmack] [mn] yeah yeah i can't imagine you know dating people for that short a period and uh 

532.65 536.10 B: [sigh] and deciding on this is the one you're going to marry or uh 

536.35 537.26 B: (( you know )) 

536.59 539.13 A: (( mhm yeah or date or or you know )) 

537.45 541.33 B: [mn] or to really date or to let r- but 

540.63 541.89 A: long term 

541.48 545.27 B: i i can't see people doing what they do 

545.39 547.17 B: [lipsmack] in front of the world 

547.17 548.04 A: yeah 

547.26 548.25 B: uh

565.55 579.33 B: i guess i've watched blind date sometimes or which i g- i guess would qualify as the same type thing [sigh] it's just uh to me it's just weird how people can act or uh behave themselves especially [sigh] being in front of the world 

571.02 572.13 A: i guess so 

576.05 576.95 A: very m- 

578.57 580.83 A: very much out there and very

584.11 585.45 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah yeah you know )) 

584.58 590.34 A: i'd rather stay behind my t._v. screen here you know [laughter] than get out there and have everybody critique me 

587.33 588.72 B: [mn] [laughter] well 

589.93 597.22 B: right you know an- and [laughter] i guess i come from the age i wouldn't w- not only wouldn't want to embarrass myself i wouldn't want to embarrass my parents [sigh] 

596.86 597.98 A: exactly 

597.33 598.13 B: [laughter]
