4.68 6.12 A: pat 

8.75 10.02 B: hi um 

10.81 14.74 B: out of those choices probably drinking alcohol excessively would be 

15.72 17.05 A: (( okay ooh oh )) 

15.84 18.04 B: on the top of my list 

19.99 25.28 A: okay if you say alcohol excessively i would probably have to agree although i'm 

25.91 27.94 A: [sigh] death on gossip so 

29.79 31.13 B: [noise] no i don't know 

29.97 34.85 A: i guess it depends on if you're sitting on your couch at home drinking alcohol [laughter] excessively or 

33.83 34.92 B: [laughter] 

34.97 36.61 A: driving a car [laughter] 

36.44 42.54 B: yeah i guess see my problem is i look at [sigh] if you're drinking you're going to be going out driving and you know then you have a problem 

43.13 44.73 B: and if you're always drinking 

46.04 46.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

46.82 48.01 B: (( [sigh] gossip )) 

46.82 48.08 A: right oh 

48.27 56.81 B: you know i don't know a little bit here a little bit i guess excessively might be a problem but you can always you know walk away and not have to listen to it 

51.13 54.07 A: [noise] yeah what kind of gossip is it [laughter] [lipsmack] 

56.91 59.83 A: that's true too and smoking you know well 

60.79 63.61 A: [noise] you're killing yourself and it's expensive and 

64.28 67.27 B: but you're not hurting someone else [sigh] 

64.80 66.19 A: [sigh] overeating 

67.32 70.46 B: that's m- my problem with the alcohol is that it 

67.52 70.35 A: well that depends on if they're breathing that or not 

71.64 75.41 B: you know the jury's still out whether or not that's [sigh] really true 

74.34 77.14 A: yeah overeating and not exercising well 

77.33 79.18 A: [sigh] that's your choice 

79.18 81.30 B: well that only hurts you 

81.27 83.64 A: yeah that doesn't hurt anybody but you 

84.46 86.15 A: (( but yeah i don't know )) 

86.22 89.57 A: [laughter] that's the hardest question i think i've ever heard [laughter] 

86.79 88.43 B: [laughter] 

89.61 92.15 B: [laughter] it's like well which is worse well hm 

92.53 95.36 B: after seeing a few lives messed up by alcohol 

96.26 97.91 B: there i have a problem 

96.45 97.39 A: (( a few )) 

98.21 102.90 A: well i've seen some lives messed up by smoking i've seen some lives messed up by alcohol 

104.43 109.00 A: i g- guess it depends i don't have any problem with anybody drinking as long as they're 

110.26 112.49 A: [sigh] doing it themselves 

112.19 113.91 B: yeah oh [laughter] 

113.20 115.89 A: yeah the family i mean are you spending your money on 

116.57 119.23 A: cigarettes and alcohol instead of 

119.27 120.58 A: diapers 

120.92 123.85 B: then we have a problem [sigh] other than that i mean 

122.55 123.64 A: yeah i've 

125.60 127.45 A: that's a little too hard a question 

125.70 128.80 B: [sigh] well they come up with some strange questions 

131.67 133.73 A: and i can't remember the other choices 

133.82 135.11 B: (( [noise] gossiping )) 

134.25 136.08 A: (( exerc- gossip )) 

138.02 140.76 B: it seems to me if somebody's gossiping then you just walk away 

141.60 143.39 B: you don't have to listen to 'em 

143.03 145.23 A: it's kind of a vicious thing to do though 

146.20 147.57 B: oh but i've done it 

147.62 149.63 A: (( [sigh] oh so have i. [laughter] )) 

148.02 152.12 B: [laughter] [laughter] we had somebody at work who was really bad 

150.34 153.58 A: i've also been the recipient of it though and it's not quite as 

153.74 156.98 A: [sigh] i guess it depends on if it's true gossip or not 

159.34 161.37 B: yeah there's that to look at too 

161.78 167.41 B: because sometimes it's just malicious gossip and then even a little bit of malicious gossip is not good 

167.26 169.89 A: [sigh] [sigh] no that pretty much yeah 

167.62 168.88 B: [sigh] but if it's 

170.03 172.39 A: [sigh] we need more details 

171.75 175.87 B: [laughter] okay folks who is doing the questions [lipsmack] 

175.13 178.75 A: either that or i can just moralize anything away i guess it doesn't matter 

178.79 179.35 A: (( [sigh] )) 

180.54 183.24 B: i think anybody can moralize just about anything [laughter] i 

183.02 185.13 A: well that's probably true [laughter] 

187.01 191.20 B: mean because the other people will say oh it doesn't matter if you get drunk every night if you're not married 

191.28 193.65 B: and you know as long as you just stay at home 

194.84 197.80 A: which is probably true i guess 

197.95 200.89 A: [noise] if it's only hurting you i guess it doesn't matter 

200.93 204.55 A: [sigh] it doesn't matter if you smoke four packs of cigarettes a day if [sigh] 

205.07 209.02 A: you're the only one and the money's not supposed to be going some place else 

208.64 213.07 B: [sigh] can you imagine an apartment though if somebody smoked four packs of cigarettes a day 

213.22 217.92 A: [cough] i've probably been in apartments where people smoked four packs of cigarettes a day 

213.48 214.69 B: oh god 

219.76 226.08 A: so it actually [sigh] course i've been in apartments where they drank a lot too and [sigh] booze don't smell much better 

227.97 230.86 B: mm i can't even imagine four packs a day and i used to smoke it's 

232.76 235.95 B: funny [mn] how things change once you have children 

232.96 234.46 A: (( [sigh] yeah [noise] )) 

235.87 236.81 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

237.86 238.47 A: (( yeah )) 

237.93 241.42 B: like suddenly nothing is good any more no can't do any of that [sigh] 

242.34 244.36 A: (( [noise] let's see overeating )) 

244.48 250.94 A: exercise smoking and drinking excessively i guess excessively is the keyword there [noise] 

250.71 253.45 B: yeah 'cause anything in excess is a problem 

253.36 256.42 A: yeah [mn] food in excess is overeating 

257.81 261.68 A: [sigh] laying on the couch to excess that's that's exercising [laughter] 

258.23 259.24 B: although 

263.19 267.38 B: [sigh] oh but you have to look at how much overeating are they talking about 

267.09 267.92 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

269.04 274.08 B: i mean are they talking about the people that sit at home and they're four hundred pounds and they don't get off the couch besides to you know

510.08 513.45 B: to me any excess as long as you're not hurting somebody else 

515.78 520.23 A: [noise] [noise] i guess i was th- i guess i would have to go if i had to choose one 

515.97 516.93 B: you know 

522.50 523.70 A: (( [noise] )) 

524.33 529.34 A: [sigh] i would choose alcohol just because the minute you say drinking excess 

529.49 531.75 A: you start thinking about people driving [sigh] 

531.97 538.11 B: yeah [sigh] even if they're not driving they tend to get nasty and rude and once they get to start to excess 

536.23 537.13 A: yeah 

539.01 542.74 A: they tend to lack judgment which leads to a whole bunch of other 

543.23 546.48 A: behaviour so if i had to choose one i would 

547.54 552.88 A: [sigh] if i had to choose just one [laughter] i would choose that 

552.27 557.98 B: you notice they didn't give us drugs now if they gave us drinking and drugs together then we could just go boom that's it bye see ya [sigh] 

557.93 559.71 A: oh yeah did they say drugs 

559.69 560.95 B: i don't think so 

565.52 568.60 A: i don't think they did either [sigh] no i think alcohol 

567.08 571.26 B: [noise] it's funny that they put they put overeating and not exercising in there 

572.05 576.54 A: yeah those two go together who cares if you overeat all the time if you're you know 

576.98 579.66 A: [sigh] [laughter] jogging twenty miles a day 

579.94 582.59 B: [laughter] well no but that can hurt your body though 

583.23 586.38 A: okay jogging was a bad thing walking twenty miles a day 

585.01 585.81 B: [laughter] 

586.79 589.16 B: [sigh] but you know the people that over exercise 

587.28 589.66 A: [laughter] non-impact aerobics 

590.29 592.86 B: over exercise until they stop their periods 

593.16 593.95 A: (( yes )) 

594.08 596.89 B: i mean you're hurting your body just as much that way 

595.78 599.10 A: but you don't do that you don't do that if you're eating enough then
