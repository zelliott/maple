76.13 78.25 B: yes definitely 

77.74 78.63 A: you know and just the 

78.74 79.69 A: the thought you go to 

79.83 84.05 A: where we live is in the country and you go to the grocery store and i mean it smells like cigarette smoke and it's just 

84.41 85.16 A: nasty 

84.90 91.29 B: yeah and especially when it's all over people's clothes when you're walking through like a restaurant or something and you get a w- 

88.04 89.01 A: yeah 

89.64 99.38 A: yup and you can't go to a restaurant where the non-smoking area in order to get to the non-smoking area you might be able to get there from the door but you can't get to the bathroom without going through the smoking area 

97.57 107.26 B: right and you need to sit out you need to sit outside actually you need to be away from it because if it's enclosed forget it it's really bad

108.84 109.37 A: you know th- 

109.48 111.60 A: think of all the money people could save if they didn't do it 

111.44 116.39 B: oh forget it here where i live it's about four four something a pack 

119.99 124.44 A: it's pretty bad here it's much worse than anywhere else i think just because 

124.75 126.39 A: they figure they can get you 

127.36 127.90 A: the 

131.36 131.95 A: right 

135.83 142.27 A: yup and the government decided you know they're going to make them do these ads the ads don't do any good because they're still using stuff that's going to attract the kids 

140.16 140.62 B: right 

142.11 145.83 B: yeah because it's still promoting it's still promoting the smoking 

145.67 146.71 A: right and im- 

146.01 157.86 B: whether or not how stupid the commercials are it's still showing people that there's you know that there's smoke tobacco products out there and then they feel that they're being cool to to smoke 

150.04 150.87 A: yeah that 

155.98 157.54 A: right there being cool and plus it's 

157.67 164.07 A: i don't know they they promote it because you know it's like anything else that you save points for and you get prizes marlboro does that whole prize thing 

163.71 168.18 B: yes and they have those the the gear and the right 

164.36 165.31 A: you know

169.90 170.88 B: yes 

171.23 172.99 B: exactly yes 

172.45 173.55 A: yeah and i just i mean it's 

173.86 177.34 A: really wrong that they do that because that's just making more smokers in this world 

181.61 182.33 A: yup 

181.69 189.09 B: i can get i can get a free whatever key chain or wha- whatever the case may be but exa- 

186.98 190.74 A: over priced merchandise that you could go on e. bay and probably get cheaper 

189.22 197.63 B: yeah you can buy it for fifty cents but if you smoke enough cigarettes we'll give it to you for free 

194.70 195.60 A: right 

196.01 202.71 A: so go ahead and kill your lungs you know and then we'll we'll reward you by giving you something to keep you warm while you're dying in the hospital 

201.37 207.99 B: exactly no it's true that that i i have to agree well at least we picked the same at least we picked the same topic 

208.04 210.92 A: yeah well this uh this is true 

210.75 216.71 B: yeah i'm not really sure how the how this study goes like i don't know 

216.55 221.41 A: i don't know i haven't done one yet this is my first one they just sent me my password and everything yesterday 

218.37 218.74 B: oh 

221.16 222.58 B: yeah me too 

222.11 226.59 A: and they said it was supposed to be five minutes and from what i understand everybody was supposed to be getting their passwords yesterday 

226.45 227.43 B: oh okay 

227.55 232.24 A: from where from where i got the link from everybody was getting them yesterday and nobody had done one yet 

228.22 228.73 B: right 

229.61 229.95 B: yeah 

232.29 235.90 B: oh okay oh so then we're actually lucky to be in the first ones 

232.99 234.11 A: so they were supposed to start today 

236.06 238.06 A: i guess yeah 

243.11 243.61 A: right 

243.39 247.59 B: and then i got it now i'm like oh wow this is fantastic but i don't know how 

247.86 254.71 B: i don't know how it works like maybe we talk on the phone for a certain amount of time and then the operator comes on or something i don't know 

254.81 257.92 A: i don't know i think they said it's supposed to be five minutes long or something 

258.69 259.44 B: oh okay 

258.69 265.59 A: i'm reading through the email i'm reading it right now to see because it don't know how long it's supposed to be 

260.76 262.81 B: okay good 

266.75 267.22 A: (( for something )) 

267.45 267.88 A: ask about 

268.02 268.32 A: each other's 

268.42 269.34 A: experience and opinions 

269.59 269.98 B: right 

271.98 274.24 A: their operator will call you back in the next forty eight hours 

274.24 274.71 A: topic 

275.14 275.51 B: okay 

275.22 276.51 A: doesn't say for how long 

276.62 277.10 B: oh 

277.38 279.63 A: so it just says if you choose not to talk hang up 

279.36 279.89 B: right 

280.50 282.68 A: so i don't know 

282.10 284.48 B: yeah i don't i don't know either that's a 

284.97 286.21 B: that's a little strange 

285.00 289.76 A: (( that's a )) i've never done a phone survey before i always do them on the net or you know in the mail or whatever 

288.41 288.87 B: yeah 

289.86 297.16 B: yeah i've done them i've done them on the net i got one in the mail but i i chose not to do it it was like ten pages long 

297.01 300.88 A: well they they've i've done quite a few on the net and (( quine uh )) quite a few in the mail and 

301.28 303.53 A: um thi- i've done stuff for the penn 

303.63 304.14 A: for the 

304.40 305.27 A: what is it baron 

304.85 307.43 B: the baron surveys i di- i've done those 

305.97 307.18 A: yeah i've done baron surveys 

307.85 309.95 A: yeah but this the ti- first time doing it for fisher 

310.03 310.61 B: yes 

311.18 311.64 B: yeah 

312.14 313.52 B: hm i don't know 

313.89 316.75 B: i'm not too sure how this works unless we're on a time clock 

317.42 318.47 B: and at the end 

317.49 321.17 A: but that's well i'm thinking is that it's going to cut it off at five minutes or something 

320.44 324.38 B: that's what i'm th- that's what i'm thinking 

323.85 326.77 A: i don't know i think that they're just trying to see how two people 

327.13 330.56 A: who don't know each other would converse on the phone al- the first one was gossiping 

328.96 329.78 B: exactly 

331.02 334.49 B: there you go how'd you f- how'd you know that 

333.14 336.39 A: i'm just sitting there thinking it was running through my head and i uh 

334.90 340.83 B: because it was driving me crazy i'm like the first one i like that one to talk about and i took 

339.96 341.48 A: the gossiping 

351.89 354.15 A: no 

354.58 364.33 A: yeah but yeah i remembered it work's slow i've been at my son's school all day (( so where it's very very slow )) in my head right now i'm still on the kindergarten mentality 

362.63 364.93 B: oh wow how old's your child 

364.64 365.53 A: six 

365.13 366.42 B: oh wow i have a two year old 

366.49 368.87 A: ah you're just beginning then trust me 

368.22 378.35 B: oh yes i have a two year old that just woke up from a nap when the phone rang i was like oh my god i hope i can be on the phone long enough to complete the survey because he usually goes crazy wanting his mother 

372.11 372.70 A: oh that 

377.90 381.59 A: yeah i usually i c- i watch a two year old and she isn't here today and usually 

381.39 382.27 B: oh wow 

381.79 385.01 A: (( )) as soon the moment i pick up the phone she's running behind my back getting into something 

385.18 385.94 B: and screaming 

386.04 394.69 A: yes oh yes or you know she has a a three month old little sister and she's over there trying to feed the baby something or you know (( so i said )) 

386.40 386.85 B: yeah 

395.64 397.90 A: yes it could be very dangerous 

398.10 401.81 A: but um no they aren't here today because i had the meeting with my son's teacher 

401.94 402.73 B: oh okay 

402.47 404.41 A: so i was at the school all day 

403.93 406.63 B: you see that and that must have been lots of fun 

406.58 408.45 A: oh yeah it's a 

407.20 409.77 B: yeah 

408.62 414.24 A: what is it the hundredth day or something so they were having a hundredth party and everything had to be counted to a hundred and 

412.09 412.94 B: oh wow 

414.35 414.98 A: yeah 

414.83 415.88 B: oh that's nice 

415.81 417.31 A: that was definitely 

416.59 424.52 B: i i don't know anything about the schools yet or anything like i said i have time for my son let's keep him out of school for a another year or two 

423.74 426.56 A: yeah that would be my thing is once they start school it's 

424.66 425.12 B: yeah 

426.71 427.48 A: all over with 

427.99 428.50 A: yes 

431.90 432.72 B: definitely 

432.80 433.32 A: yeah it 

432.95 440.23 B: but i duh i did agree with you on the smoking topic but i have to go i'll i'll i'll say for their little recording that that was the one i was originally 

440.10 441.88 A: the gossiping 

441.08 448.39 B: the gossiping because i have people that say one thing and it goes through like a chain reaction and by the time it gets back to you 

442.03 442.94 A: well 

446.72 447.23 A: oh that's 

447.58 452.55 A: where we live right now that's the way it is we live in a small town and i mean we run a business up the road and 

452.69 455.64 A: everyone knows everyone and everyone has a different story about someone 

455.80 461.00 B: right and they all think they know everybody's business and nobody knows anything 

456.44 457.25 A: (( it's like )) 

458.11 458.70 A: right 

459.57 464.97 A: exactly heaven forbid my son walk outside the front door and spit on the ground because within twenty minutes 

465.08 469.91 A: half of the town would be calling me and telling me and it wouldn't be just that he had spit on the ground it would be twenty million different things 

466.89 468.22 B: oh my 

480.99 481.43 A: yup 

485.05 485.50 A: yup 

487.35 488.85 B: so i don't like that at all 

489.05 490.60 B: everyone's into everybody's business 

490.94 494.36 B: certain things i could see okay if there's danger involved 

494.65 497.80 A: right if it if they're doing something that's going to hurt someone or 

494.77 495.87 B: or something 

497.20 503.13 B: exactly but i mean just the stupidest things you could get into a conversation about and 

498.54 499.79 A: something like that 

503.32 506.04 B: it gets totally twisted because people just like to talk 

506.21 510.13 A: oh i know believe me we put up with it all the time 

510.28 515.85 A: and our business works on word of mouth so i mean in some ways it's good if someone says something good about us 

512.57 513.35 B: oh no 

515.92 516.50 B: you're right 

516.53 519.61 A: but let one person say something bad and i mean that's it 

519.58 525.73 B: yeah no it's true because then the whole town'll feel well this missus so and so said this so 

522.45 522.78 A: yup 

525.49 526.64 A: yeah the (( exactly what it is )) 

525.94 527.95 B: we we better not go there any more 

527.78 528.32 A: right 

528.43 532.40 A: (( it's ducky )) how it works you know he wouldn't ha- he wouldn't honor this guarantee and you know 

531.95 532.67 B: exactly 

532.69 534.63 A: and that's all they wrote because it's all over with 

534.56 541.85 B: yes exactly yeah so that see that was going to be that was that was my original topic but see actually now we've touched base on two topics 

535.55 536.01 A: so 

536.98 537.32 A: yeah 

537.59 539.13 A: gossiping 

542.38 553.23 B: so we should we should get bonus yeah we should get bonus for two topics which uh it's actually strange that we were able to cover both on this survey thing 

543.44 545.36 A: yeah double 

552.90 554.34 A: yeah that was but 

553.99 554.40 B: yeah 

554.61 564.52 B: but i have uh like i said i never did the phone surveys before and hopefully you know hopefully they'll they said that you could actually get up to three 

558.71 559.30 A: no
