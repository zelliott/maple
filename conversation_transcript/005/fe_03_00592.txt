1.92 3.63 A: hi i'm sue 

3.89 4.65 B: i'm chris 

6.11 7.82 B: i'm ah a student at 

8.12 9.45 B: university of pennsylvania 

10.04 13.41 A: and i'm a librarian out at the other corner of pennsylvania 

15.58 16.71 A: i don't know i 

16.89 19.96 A: have a hard figuring what holiday i might create so i 

20.60 22.01 A: i definitely have to say probably 

22.11 23.78 A: my favorite is christmas 

24.68 26.43 B: that's probably my favorite too 

27.12 27.63 B: ah but 

27.87 29.67 B: i think i'm saying that because i just had a 

30.26 30.92 A: that's true 

30.35 31.57 B: a nice winter break 

32.32 32.93 A: ah 

32.75 33.48 B: recently 

34.61 35.05 A: well i think 

35.14 36.87 A: have the fun of it is is 

37.15 43.87 A: trying to think of what somebody would like that they would to get them as a present that would surprise them and yet something that they would like to get 

44.57 45.58 B: yeah i um 

45.88 46.74 B: throughout the year 

47.24 48.50 B: i always look for stuff and then 

48.81 49.92 B: write them down and then 

50.92 52.03 B: great when they open the present 

52.81 53.93 B: remember back to 

54.05 56.31 B: february when they said oh i'd love this 

59.85 60.23 A: yeah i 

60.58 61.43 A: one year i 

61.61 62.71 A: visited my sister 

63.68 66.38 A: and kept my eyes open and afterwards she said 

66.49 69.88 A: she felt that she i had she'd had a spy visit her 

70.01 76.92 A: because of all the different presents that came because i also kind of gave other people in the family if you're thinking about something for my sister 

77.14 78.57 A: she could use this or that 

79.33 80.43 A: so that was a lot of fun 

81.78 84.48 B: so your favorite holiday is christmas because of the 

84.91 85.73 B: present giving 

86.39 89.61 A: the giving and you know the getting isn't bad either 

89.10 89.79 B: yeah 

93.51 95.01 B: i don't know about this creating thing 

95.23 95.79 A: yeah 

96.92 104.81 A: i think i would create a holiday in the summer that gave everybody a chance to get out and enjoy the warmth because right now there isn't very much of that around 

107.25 109.53 A: oh it's so blue and cold 

109.30 112.61 B: oh okay but it's not summer 

111.37 113.52 A: that's right 

113.73 114.15 B: um 

114.55 115.78 A: we don't really have i mean 

115.88 116.61 A: there's 

119.19 120.15 A: for a worker 

121.05 124.86 A: who gets paid holidays seems like more of them come when it's cold 

125.59 125.92 B: yeah 

126.74 128.34 A: we get the fourth of july 

129.33 131.01 A: something else in the summer would be nice 

132.37 136.61 B: right i guess as a student i don't really understand that because i get three months off 

135.19 136.34 A: ah you'll learn 

138.11 139.94 A: you'll learn 

139.96 140.76 B: good enough 

141.24 141.99 A: yeah 

143.01 144.55 A: maybe mid summer day 

145.35 145.63 B: wow 

146.10 146.92 B: yeah yeah you got 

147.07 148.49 B: you've got fourth of july weekend right 

150.48 151.34 B: do we do 

151.53 153.44 B: do you get friday or monday off for that 

153.88 158.72 A: well if you get the fourth see where i work if if the fourth of july is on a 

159.50 160.68 A: weekend then you get the 

161.11 163.33 A: if it's on a sunday you get monday and if it's on 

163.70 166.45 A: saturday you get friday but otherwise you just get the one day 

166.55 166.96 B: uh-huh 

169.46 172.05 A: but you can sometimes combine it with some vacation time 

172.82 173.28 B: oh your right 

173.80 174.17 B: you get 

174.29 175.25 B: two weeks a year 

176.06 178.47 A: well ah i actually get four 

179.23 179.94 B: that's pretty good 

180.27 186.59 A: yes librarians don't get paid very much money so in return they try to give us things that don't cost 

188.33 188.68 B: wow 

189.35 189.97 A: so 

189.61 190.34 B: that's a trade off 

190.69 190.97 A: you'd 

191.15 192.40 A: you've got a long ways well 

192.53 194.42 A: perhaps not a long ways where where are you 

194.74 195.44 B: i'm a freshmen 

195.51 201.00 A: ah yes you've got a long way before you start thinking about what you're going to do to earn your money to pay back your student loans 

201.33 201.60 B: well 

202.44 203.53 B: maybe a long way though 

203.73 206.11 B: to start it but i have to start thinking about it 

206.45 208.85 A: yeah i it's it's not a good idea to keep 

209.95 212.26 A: put it off to long but sometimes you have to a 

213.17 215.43 A: do enough to know what you really want to do 

215.07 215.66 B: right right 

218.55 220.64 A: so i guess if i'm going to create a holiday 

221.49 222.86 A: and it would be in the summer 

223.59 225.48 A: i'd make it mid's summer's day 

226.27 226.92 B: summer day 

227.31 228.85 A: yeah mid summer day that 

229.31 230.42 A: the solstice 

230.61 231.80 B: not mid summer's night 

232.54 235.87 A: ah well day in terms of twenty four hours day sorry 

235.46 235.81 B: uh-huh 

236.07 236.60 B: right 

237.22 237.95 A: confusing 

238.91 240.31 B: that sounds like a great holiday 

240.50 241.12 A: yeah 

241.48 242.48 A: they maybe kind of 

242.69 245.91 A: since since christmas is sort of near the winter solstice 

246.92 247.39 A: make a 

247.68 250.52 A: the same kind of thing where you do something for other people 

250.80 251.18 B: right 

252.02 252.98 B: didn't summer sol- 

253.07 254.16 B: it's that in august 

254.47 255.36 A: no no 

254.60 255.21 B: around like 

255.53 255.87 A: no 

256.04 257.94 A: ah summer solstice is in june 

258.55 259.15 B: oh okay 

260.19 261.92 A: six months after christmas roughly 

262.99 264.48 B: oh i'm thinking of the ah 

263.83 264.18 A: which 

265.70 267.11 B: meteor shower (( )) 

267.01 267.88 A: ah the (( lanet )) 

268.30 270.14 A: is it lanets i don't know how to pronounce it 

270.29 271.51 A: le- leonidies 

272.00 272.57 A: whatever the 

273.39 275.19 A: correct latin pronunciation is 

277.63 278.52 B: so that would consist of 

278.80 280.34 B: one day or one week 

280.82 281.80 A: ah 

282.61 284.24 A: i would say probably a day 

284.89 286.23 A: since it's tied to a day but 

289.85 291.48 B: it doesn't sound too unreasonable 

290.06 295.54 A: and you celebrate by getting up as early getting up with the sun and you have to stay up as long as the sun is up 

296.79 299.14 A: course getting up with the sun then means you'll be getting up 

299.36 299.86 A: early 

300.00 301.25 B: what yeah which 

301.82 303.23 B: doesn't work for a lot of people 

305.57 306.42 A: but 

305.78 306.79 B: me being one of them 

306.91 308.79 A: if there's something special coming 

310.86 313.48 A: and there has to food associated with it somehow 

314.85 316.59 A: that's the big part of holidays really 

316.72 318.29 B: there has to be a feast in the middle of the day 

318.22 318.59 A: yeah 

319.66 324.98 A: i don't know what kind of food you would associate with it christmas tends to turkey and easter ham 

325.05 325.40 B: yeah 

330.75 331.51 A: salad 

330.97 331.32 B: pig 

331.43 332.30 B: a big roast pig 

334.45 335.07 B: with an apple 

338.41 340.04 B: that's kind of like ham isn't 

340.68 341.50 B: never mind 

340.82 342.70 A: yeah but ah not quit the same 

346.06 346.59 A: could be 

346.12 347.40 B: what about the fact that um 

348.23 351.41 B: there's no religious association with this holiday 

351.80 352.77 B: that you just created 

352.96 354.14 A: yes well 

362.37 363.92 A: we have to think about that 

364.84 371.70 A: cause if we were in the southern hemisphere we could you know it would tie in the fact that the sun was beginning to come back again 

373.22 373.72 A: one thing 

374.13 376.68 A: with the seasons i just never stopped to think about the fact that 

380.04 381.29 A: there topsy turvy 

383.76 388.31 A: but i'm sure that there's something on the church calendar around that them 

388.89 390.69 A: church would grab hold of very quickly 

397.50 399.43 A: i'm trying to think because ah 

402.80 404.55 A: know in march there's 

407.33 408.04 A: oh 

409.97 410.53 A: but 

410.63 411.52 B: well easter's in 

410.91 411.60 A: there's something 

412.06 412.77 B: april isn't it 

413.20 414.61 A: well usually 

415.25 417.15 A: sometimes it can be late in march 

421.01 421.66 A: nah that's 

423.83 425.73 A: stop me if i get to technical but it 

426.01 426.75 A: based on the 

427.37 429.92 A: first full moon after the spring 

430.67 431.93 A: equinox 

432.27 432.62 A: so 

433.48 433.79 B: yeah 

433.99 435.17 A: depending upon when the 

434.09 434.64 B: it's not to technical 

437.31 440.47 A: equinox eh you know when the full moon is it can come pretty quickly 

440.93 441.23 B: right 

441.58 443.36 B: yeah well i'm orthodox so i go to 

443.44 445.08 B: by a different easter calendar anyway 

443.56 443.83 A: oh 

445.22 446.85 A: ah yes 

447.37 448.82 A: for you spring might actually 

448.93 449.71 A: yeah that's true 

450.22 450.98 A: you go by the 

451.45 452.10 A: the old 

452.53 453.17 A: equinox 

453.05 453.40 B: yeah 

455.98 456.66 B: so you're 

456.09 459.82 A: i know in in our church we have one of our easter hymns always talks about 

460.18 465.83 A: blum in every meadow leaf in ever bough 

467.37 470.11 A: ah although by that time you really wish it were 

470.48 470.86 B: yeah 

473.06 473.99 B: so what church is that 

474.62 475.89 A: i'm an episcopalian 

478.05 478.99 A: sort of 

479.63 481.01 A: not quit orthodox 

482.17 482.49 B: yeah 

482.82 485.74 B: i can't keep track of all the different sects of christianity 

485.05 486.40 A: well we're catholic without 

486.96 488.47 A: this is how i kind of put it 

488.45 489.12 B: i see 

490.18 494.86 A: one of the churches that broke away from the catholic church long enough ago that they kept most of what 

490.52 490.84 B: (( )) 

495.14 495.83 A: was there 

497.48 497.80 B: right 

497.48 497.94 A: it's ah 

499.01 499.84 A: fairly similar 

501.00 503.88 B: yeah the way i explain ah orthodoxy to people is 

505.70 506.54 B: it's another christian 

508.46 508.77 B: cross 

508.85 510.19 B: to the left instead of to the right 

512.16 513.90 B: or to the right instead of to the left (( )) 

515.26 516.37 A: yeah mirror image 

519.95 521.67 B: although it's actually much different then that 

522.69 523.85 A: actually you're probably 

524.17 525.74 A: the old one of the oldest 

526.03 526.34 B: yeah 

527.08 527.72 A: closest 

527.83 528.24 A: to the 

529.25 530.10 A: origins 

530.85 532.28 B: i think it is the oldest actually 

532.99 533.28 A: well 

533.60 535.37 A: i think there's there's all different sect 

535.84 536.39 A: orthodox 

537.50 537.96 B: yeah 

537.74 538.80 A: probably argue about 

539.76 542.07 A: who's sort of closest but ah 

543.38 543.93 A: yeah 

547.12 547.72 B: is that your phone 

551.15 553.17 B: so i guess i have to come up with a holiday now 

554.38 555.65 A: you can steal mine if you like 

555.56 557.71 B: i'm very tempted too 

559.24 560.06 B: it's a good holiday 

562.82 564.21 A: lots of fun things you can do 

569.09 570.74 B: i i really can't think of another holiday 

570.97 572.20 B: is there another holiday that 

572.38 574.79 B: fourth of july i guess isn't a religious holiday 

575.07 575.55 A: no 

576.15 578.28 A: not unless you make our country (( )) you know 

578.69 580.14 A: there are people who make 

581.38 584.11 A: being an american almost a religious experience 

583.29 583.94 B: yeah 

586.99 589.42 A: attack their symbols and you'd think they were attacking 

589.53 590.18 A: cross 

591.82 593.02 B: well burning of the flag is 

593.49 594.30 B: a very powerful message 

593.60 594.09 A: yeah 

594.52 595.65 A: it's some people 

597.39 597.87 A: got a real
