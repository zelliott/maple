19.01 21.32 A: i have a problem with the ones that um 

23.11 26.07 A: that cause people to be a drain on society (( )) 

26.21 29.80 A: uh because they cause health problems and there are things that can be controlled 

29.92 30.72 A: you know what i mean 

30.79 37.53 B: okay what are we discussing -cause when they were they were given the choices my fiance was walking through the house making fun of me 

36.61 39.73 A: well one of -em was 

40.19 41.55 A: it said which one do you find 

41.70 42.53 A: you know the most 

43.20 44.14 A: objectionable 

44.72 45.33 A: and 

45.60 46.08 A: there was 

46.32 47.84 A: um overeating 

48.01 53.19 A: smoking not exercising um drinking alcohol too excess- 

53.87 54.96 A: or caffeine 

55.43 58.20 A: and i think there were a couple of others and i can't remember them 

56.62 58.53 B: oh okay 

60.19 63.59 A: and so i guess we we have to talk about which one we think is the worst and i guess 

64.22 65.05 A: i'm not sure 

65.37 67.35 B: i'm not sure either 

65.83 67.50 A: wait perhaps the smoking because 

67.70 69.17 A: that effects other people too 

69.55 70.03 B: oh 

70.34 72.28 A: although i guess all of them can effect other people 

72.66 74.56 B: i would say it would be drinking -cause i smoke 

75.20 75.72 A: what is that 

75.57 79.70 B: i smoke but i don't drink so i would say it would be the drinking 

78.44 79.03 A: okay 

79.98 81.46 A: well we just had a um 

82.02 86.19 A: we just um i live in michigan and we just had a case here where 

86.37 87.21 A: a woman 

88.13 96.18 A: was drinking she was actually on a suspended license and she had a couple of um drunk driving convictions and she got in to two accidents 

96.98 97.66 A: um 

97.90 99.52 A: on her way to the expressway 

100.17 105.42 A: she got on the expressway going the right direction and crossed the median and started driving in the wrong direction 

105.45 105.96 B: oh 

105.81 108.46 A: and uh crashed head on into um 

108.88 109.28 A: young 

109.51 110.93 A: guy twenty eight years old 

111.69 112.44 A: and killed him 

112.59 114.09 B: oh no 

113.53 114.83 A: and you know and she is in the hos- 

114.94 118.05 A: you know she was in the hospital but she is fine i mean she is out now and i mean 

118.61 120.61 B: she was probably trying to light a cigarette huh 

120.88 122.69 A: really 

121.05 124.63 B: and crossed over in the other lane 

124.66 126.47 A: but i mean 

127.35 130.55 A: something like that and and it she was obviously trying 

131.03 132.67 A: to um you know 

133.60 133.89 A: you know 

134.12 136.87 A: cause damage or hurt people or kill people and 

137.38 140.54 A: was driving on a suspended license as it was drunk 

140.89 141.70 B: yeah 

141.32 142.52 A: for i think she was 

142.68 143.78 A: point two something 

144.42 145.56 A: and it is just you know 

147.64 148.82 A: unfortunate

161.63 161.99 B: oh 

162.71 163.31 B: okay 

163.89 167.94 A: was there a reason why you thought the drinking was worse than like you know some of the other ones 

168.22 170.43 A: -cause you know all of them really do kind of effect 

171.34 173.14 A: you know other people as well as yourself 

173.26 174.90 B: yeah um
