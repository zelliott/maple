312.07 320.87 B: well we were talking about sick kids and we started talking about kids in general i guess see i guess the that's yeah that's what happened you get it's easy to get off the subject you forget what you're talking about [laughter]

362.58 363.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

364.92 375.86 A: [cough] i found the best way to deal with depression is to read yeah what you do is you [laughter] it sounds kind of odd coming from a man okay

389.75 401.38 B: i guess you know that probably that doesn't sound odd coming from a man if you're a man raising [mn] raising kids because you run away you run away to the bathroom to get yourself a bubble bath you probably get them out of your hair for a little bit [laughter] 

390.49 391.73 A: [laughter]
