139.97 140.66 A: yeah it 

140.81 141.62 A: something like that 

141.77 143.99 A: one show that comes on on monday nights 

145.76 146.22 A: they uh 

146.32 147.70 A: people do stuff for money 

148.44 149.25 A: you know and it's

151.16 151.69 B: yeah 

153.42 156.25 B: t._v. is not what it used to be 

155.80 156.46 A: no 

157.45 158.12 B: oh 

160.89 165.45 B: and i don't think i have watched uh who wants to be a millionaire i think but maybe twice 

166.38 167.00 A: yeah 

166.49 167.26 B: i mean 

167.42 168.74 B: and some of the questions are just 

169.13 170.15 B: redundant 

170.87 172.21 B: really dumb questions 

172.94 173.57 A: yeah 

175.34 177.71 B: and i think the first one they ever done the 

178.04 181.96 B: the lady left him and divorced him and sued him for some of his money 

182.29 182.72 A: mhm 

182.95 185.53 B: so i think pretty much you know it's just a gimmick 

186.02 186.60 A: yeah 

188.00 191.47 A: uh yeah that there was a story about it in the inquirer 

193.63 197.13 A: (( )) i thought she was you know back with him again after 

197.75 201.32 B: (( )) she might be it's been a while since i heard anything about it 

203.90 206.04 B: and i know that other one that they um 

206.63 207.71 B: just did 

208.98 209.59 B: let's see what's 

209.71 210.88 B: the name of it (( )) 

211.11 213.62 B: can't quite remember the name of it it's um 

215.03 217.09 B: where the guy really wasn't a millionaire 

217.18 217.60 A: mhm 

218.03 219.42 B: he was only making like 

220.13 222.53 B: i think eighteen or nineteen thousand a year 

223.65 225.83 B: so i mean she got dumped big time 

226.05 227.76 B: thinking she was going to marry a millionaire 

228.18 228.68 A: mhm 

229.16 229.70 B: and 

231.01 231.51 B: he was 

231.91 234.53 B: probably didn't make enough just barely supports himself 

235.28 236.93 B: i think he was living home with his parents 

237.32 238.96 B: that's a new one they've come out with 

239.46 241.74 A: oh i i haven't seen that one 

242.77 243.55 A: heard about it 

243.64 246.73 B: i don't think it'll last and i think it's out you know 

247.74 249.48 B: the first show they did that it was a dupe 

249.59 251.87 B: you know the guy didn't have any money 

250.16 250.83 A: yeah 

252.15 252.86 B: so you know it's 

253.00 254.87 B: the whole scenario is pretty much blown 

255.30 255.83 A: yeah 

256.36 257.70 B: so nobody else is want to going to 

257.89 261.33 B: you know going to want to go on the show so i just don't think that one will last 

261.41 261.94 A: mhm 

266.55 269.67 B: but there's you know there's tons and tons and tons of people that like it 

270.21 272.22 B: i i for one just don't care for it 

272.15 273.35 A: yeah that now 

274.08 281.15 A: i know there are a lot of shows that i can't stand they they say they're top rated shows i don't know where they get their ratings from 

281.32 283.73 B: well a lot of the younger generation 

283.97 284.45 B: the 

284.56 285.57 B: early twenty 

286.52 287.93 B: you know pretty much watch that 

288.05 288.38 B: the 

289.40 289.87 A: and 

290.38 295.52 A: i mean because everybody that i know or talk to none of them can stand it either 

295.75 296.31 B: yeah 

296.04 298.74 A: and they'll say it's a top rated show that uh 

299.87 303.13 A: so how does that get to be like that nobody watches it 

303.71 306.36 B: no nobody i know watches that you know 

306.95 307.22 B: but 

308.19 310.21 B: some people do 

309.81 316.53 A: yeah well well there's one one show i don't know maybe you like it though i don't care for it the third rock from the sun

326.54 326.83 B: but it 

327.01 327.53 B: funny
