172.37 173.91 A: from what my email said

179.05 179.58 A: right 

179.40 179.92 B: you know

186.21 187.26 B: yeah oh yeah 

187.50 188.33 B: well 

188.56 190.26 A: and you don't want to you know 

190.57 192.47 A: i'm i'm open to why 

193.05 194.76 A: you know you think the way you do 

194.43 197.12 B: well i just you know like i said i just don't 

197.94 200.92 B: it's somethi- to me something should have been done a long time ago uh 

201.34 202.46 B: i guess 

202.57 204.65 B: what my my my being 

204.76 206.26 B: my thinking partly 

207.06 207.60 B: is 

207.80 208.68 B: why 

209.14 209.60 B: now 

211.10 212.90 B: because of everything that's going on 

213.05 216.39 A: i totally agree with you on that on that particular thing 

216.78 219.46 A: um when we were in afghanistan 

219.60 220.07 A: i mean 

219.64 219.98 B: mhm 

220.38 223.81 A: uh yeah before when we had that the the desert storm 

223.70 224.13 B: yeah 

224.34 225.44 A: i think that's when 

225.92 227.26 A: they should have went after 

227.49 228.18 A: saddam 

228.23 228.86 B: okay yeah 

228.57 231.56 A: and i don't think they should have stopped until they got him 

232.04 233.72 B: well exactly exactly 

233.42 236.12 A: and uh i think that was a lot of wasted 

236.59 237.18 A: um 

237.78 241.47 A: military or united states money into the ma- military 

241.88 242.18 B: yeah 

242.25 243.00 A: and um 

243.16 244.51 A: as far as i'm concerned 

245.08 248.52 A: i think the bushes have a lot to do with it 

248.84 252.19 A: -cause as you as you know his father was in office 

252.25 252.83 B: right 

252.88 255.49 A: when they went into the desert storm 

255.59 256.09 B: right 

256.03 257.22 A: was and um 

257.50 260.02 A: and now he's back i mean his son's here 

260.50 262.43 A: and um i just think 

263.17 264.71 A: that they've put our 

265.37 268.41 A: country i don't think i don't think that uh bombing 

269.13 273.08 A: that's i mean not the bombing but the airplane crash that took place at the new york 

273.20 273.64 B: yeah 

273.32 277.76 A: trade center i don't really think that that is what has hurt our economy 

278.73 281.07 A: i i really think that uh bush 

281.76 284.36 A: and his efforts eh for the military 

284.56 284.96 B: mhm 

285.08 289.14 A: thing you know to go back into war i think that is what's hurt our economy 

288.91 289.68 B: for really 

289.98 291.31 A: yeah i really do 

290.75 291.11 B: well 

291.41 293.75 B: i guess i never really thought about it like that 

291.92 292.63 A: i mean i've 

293.27 294.02 A: somewhat 

294.17 294.74 A: um 

295.52 297.62 A: i think it has gone you know the 

298.32 302.32 A: when the disaster happened in new york i think it um 

300.71 301.12 B: mhm 

302.72 305.82 A: brought people closer people were a lot more 

306.18 312.64 A: unsure of what you know they wanted to do and everything but i think the fact that bush brought 

309.89 310.46 B: right 

312.73 318.85 A: you know decided okay we're going to go to war over this you know i think that his um i think he's the one that 

319.19 321.11 A: kind of provoked the the fear 

321.49 322.95 A: into everybody 

322.54 325.31 B: well yeah i can understand your opinion there 

325.53 328.26 A: and then a lot of companies started pulling back 

328.41 329.00 B: yeah right 

329.26 329.61 B: right 

329.56 332.23 A: i mean you know it's first it starts out with a 

332.37 336.78 A: security on the airplanes and then of course they lose business and 

337.22 339.06 A: and then it just dwindled down 

338.83 342.22 B: well and look at too i mean look u._s. air's done 

342.84 343.33 B: um 

343.78 345.56 B: whatever what the other airline is that 

345.68 347.05 B: you know everybody's filing bankruptcy 

347.28 347.67 A: right 

347.86 354.25 B: you know what's that i i guess i just don't understand i mean uh you're right thought i don't think it was just that 

354.47 356.86 B: i mean i think a little bit but i don't think just that 

358.67 359.07 B: um 

359.40 364.15 B: okay here's a question for you on the same note um not on a 

360.84 361.40 A: okay 

364.51 365.86 B: nine eleven thing but 

366.64 372.99 B: okay how the united states is going over to see what weapons um 

374.26 375.53 B: hussein has 

375.67 376.18 A: mhm 

376.18 376.72 B: what 

376.91 378.10 B: what is the point 

378.81 380.63 A: right and and if they 

381.10 381.95 A: i understand 

382.23 386.26 A: exactly what you're talking about there and then if they have gone over and seen what they got 

386.83 387.61 A: why 

387.72 389.78 A: haven't they seized those weapons 

391.00 393.21 A: you know i mean they have the power to do so 

393.69 394.61 B: oh yeah yeah 

393.71 394.26 A: you know 

394.65 397.94 A: so why haven't they seized those weapons that you know that right there would 

394.79 395.32 B: definitely 

398.52 399.15 A: you know 

399.42 402.18 A: take away all of saddam's power right there 

401.77 404.55 B: mm right well and also too why 

405.28 409.96 B: i mean look at all the money they're spending just to go take their inventory their weapon inventory 

409.83 410.67 A: exactly 

410.91 411.24 B: but 

411.67 412.38 B: also 

413.81 418.30 A: well you know you know now that you're talking about this now that we're both talking about this 

414.66 415.10 B: mm 

418.23 418.56 B: mhm 

418.75 420.48 A: y- you have kind of opened my 

421.16 424.70 A: my my thoughts up to your opinion because um 

425.58 426.76 A: see your side uh and 

426.88 427.97 A: because um 

429.21 432.00 A: there's a lot so many families that are going to 

432.58 433.97 A: suffer because of this 

433.87 435.57 B: thank you yes exactly 

435.09 435.82 A: but 

436.15 438.00 A: okay but 

438.13 442.15 A: um and you know and there's already been families that have suffered before 

442.41 444.65 A: you know eh w- with the desert storm 

442.84 443.10 B: yep 

444.72 445.11 B: right 

445.13 445.55 A: you know 

445.67 446.02 B: right 

446.08 446.90 A: but 

447.00 448.77 A: these are people that have 

449.13 452.05 A: signed up to do so you know for their country 

452.42 454.94 A: and i'm you know i'm sure they don't go into it 

455.04 457.75 A: thinking okay they're going to go to war tomorrow or whatever 

457.87 459.63 B: well yeah yeah 

459.43 460.14 A: but 

461.03 462.51 A: i think their whole family 

463.71 465.85 A: uh is prepared for that 

466.04 466.59 A: you know 

466.94 468.40 A: for that situation 

469.24 470.31 A: so that you know 

470.42 471.99 A: so that manifests itself 

472.02 473.45 B: right eh 

473.69 478.02 B: well and like well considering all that has happened yeah i mean i- 

478.62 479.89 B: you have to be prepared 

479.96 481.08 A: right 

480.30 483.05 B: i mean there's no doubt about that um 

483.87 487.49 B: i don't know i guess uh like you said they have the power to seize them 

487.63 488.38 A: mhm 

488.12 491.20 B: but honestly do you think that um 

494.05 494.89 B: that they're 

495.04 498.14 B: that they're actually know exactly what they have 

498.82 499.93 B: d- do you know what i mean 

499.20 504.32 A: well no i y- y- no you got a point there i don't think that we know everything they have 

504.84 505.90 B: i mean uh d- you think 

505.46 507.85 A: but also i think if we wanted them 

506.70 507.28 B: mm 

508.10 509.42 A: we would (( a )) already had -em 

510.46 511.04 A: you know 

510.89 511.95 B: yeah that's yeah 

511.55 515.31 A: i think this is like a mickey mouse game the government's playing 

512.11 512.51 B: yeah 

516.00 517.80 B: well that's ridiculous 

516.15 519.14 A: just to keep us in war all the time 

519.64 521.55 B: see that's my thing right there exactly 

519.83 520.30 A: it 

520.62 524.16 A: it took bush to get it took us to get bush out of 

524.64 526.14 A: the presidency 

526.34 528.36 A: to to get rid of the war 

529.27 529.96 B: there we are 

530.04 531.28 A: and then here we are 

531.18 531.94 B: exactly 

531.54 532.83 A: exactly 

533.01 534.02 B: well i can't yeah 

534.85 538.24 B: and i i don't know i'm sorry but if i'm a if i'm a terrorist and 

538.91 540.80 B: you know there's a there's a chance that 

541.07 542.07 B: eh ya- that 

542.40 547.29 B: you're going to end up going to war with me but you want to see what weapons i have you think i'm going to tell you 

547.45 548.64 A: exactly i don't 

548.12 552.19 B: ye- to me that's just it's just a huge huge waste of money 

549.32 549.76 A: yeah 

552.53 554.87 A: exactly they're they're not going to 

554.97 557.70 A: they're not going to show us what they've really got 

558.24 559.67 A: and um 

558.26 559.62 B: oh no of course not 

560.14 561.01 A: and um 

561.65 564.03 A: so this is all kind of like a mickey mouse game that
