11.60 12.98 A: so um 

13.90 16.28 A: how many calls have you done so far 

15.63 17.21 B: this is my first one 

16.88 19.99 A: (( okay this this is my second i did did one last night )) 

19.69 20.70 B: okay 

20.66 21.50 A: so 

21.73 22.87 A: (( what do you do )) 

22.74 24.20 B: i'm a nurse 

24.05 27.99 A: okay i happen to be a an education administrator 

27.84 28.74 B: okay 

28.48 29.36 A: so 

30.07 32.56 B: so i guess you would think computers are pretty important 

32.96 40.18 A: well it it kinda depends i mean i i wasn't sure you know how specific they were gonna get with the topic of education 

40.57 41.64 A: (( um you )) 

42.00 45.99 A: know i think i think technology education is port- important 

46.60 49.02 A: um i'm not sure 

49.71 54.10 A: you know i i don't think computers are going to replace teachers 

54.86 56.79 A: as an instructional tool 

56.77 57.70 B: right 

58.40 61.06 A: i i think they're a nice thing to um 

61.79 64.73 A: you know just to be able to supplement to be able to 

64.88 67.33 A: you know have kids drill and practise 

68.17 71.37 A: so that the teacher can maybe spend one on one time 

71.60 73.32 A: with kids but 

73.57 75.93 A: you know i don't i don't see them as 

75.96 77.09 A: being 

77.25 80.26 A: you know the be all and end all of education 

81.01 83.65 B: right i would agree with you on that um 

83.89 93.68 B: i guess i just look at it i mean i know i didn't really have computers growing up um too much with you know my education and stuff um not until later actually when i was in nursing school and stuff so 

89.83 91.08 A: mhm 

93.50 107.64 B: i guess i look at it now um you know all the elementary schools and all that kind of stuff are being taught right away of how to use the internet and i agree with you i don't think computers are going to replace a teacher and i don't think anything anybody can replace that um 

107.72 117.02 B: i guess i just kinda feel like though they are a good good source of information um just more on the lines i guess more with the internet aspect 

116.40 117.85 A: mhm 

117.58 124.14 B: that you know things are so much easier at hand but i guess on the same time you kinda lose the aspect of a library 

124.43 125.46 B: um 

125.84 128.96 B: you know for kids to do their own type of research in that aspect 

128.99 132.88 A: well i'll tell you what though i mean you know i mean libraries are nice 

133.22 139.27 A: but you know the the quality of information you have at your fingertips with the internet is pretty amazing 

139.54 143.29 A: and and you know you you can find things on the internet that that 

143.39 146.96 A: you have no idea really where to start even looking for 

147.16 151.53 A: in in the traditional research front research process 

152.22 155.50 A: and and so you know i think the internet's important that way 

159.14 170.88 B: yeah once again as i said i know i used it a lot just in some of my research projects for for my nursing education and stuff and it definitely was a lot easier because i mean i had obviously the comforts of my own home that i didn't have to 

164.88 165.73 A: (( mhm )) 

170.23 171.26 A: right 

170.96 177.39 B: to go to the university and stuff and do that because i was a non traditional student did live at home 

177.63 182.31 B: and you know commuted to school and everything so it's like i had all that resources right there 

182.27 185.20 A: i'll tell you what i mean you know speaking of that you know for 

185.21 188.98 A: for post secondary education computers are really becoming 

189.26 192.46 A: kind of important as you've experienced 

190.27 191.25 B: mhm 

193.21 196.41 B: yeah i guess a lot a lot of stuff's actually being done on 

196.42 201.69 B: maybe not necessarily on line but the teleconferencing type things are now being done 

201.79 204.49 B: through them for a lot of the post as you said there's 

204.94 208.83 B: graduate schools and all that kind of stuff people are able to do that kind of stuff now 

209.07 212.23 A: (( well i know where i've taken at least one one course on line )) 

212.39 214.72 A: my husband's taken a course on line 

215.05 216.70 B: now do you like that 

216.13 217.18 A: um 

218.08 222.98 A: well i mean you know there there are there are benefits and there are there are drawbacks but 

223.25 226.16 A: i i know i was satisfied with the course that i took 

226.78 227.89 A: um 

228.21 235.02 A: i my husband though took music appreciation and i'm guessing that you know maybe maybe he would of liked to have been in a traditional setting 

235.67 237.19 A: you know with with 

237.29 243.95 A: traditional instruments even i mean he had access to the computer keyboard and also 

238.82 239.86 B: right 

244.25 249.51 A: you know a musical keyboard but i don't think that was the same for that particular course 

249.95 250.85 B: right 

251.44 257.71 B: yeah you know i think that would be kind of weird especially that kind of course not to actually be in a classroom where you could actually 

257.93 264.42 B: experience the live instruments and stuff like that i mean depending on how advanced it is and everything 

260.55 261.56 A: yeah 

265.12 267.87 B: that's one i mean i never i haven't done any type of 

268.09 277.30 B: of courses ever you know on line or anything like that i do know it's a lot easier though to type the paper on the computer versus the typewriter 

276.75 279.95 A: oh i know it it's incredible 

277.72 278.93 B: [laughter] 

280.03 287.69 B: those those mistakes you used to make on a regular typewriter it's just so much easier to correct on a computer especially with the spell checks these days 

287.11 288.86 A: oh yeah 

289.14 291.85 A: and that's another thing you know that technology gives 

292.42 296.40 A: people access to higher education that that wouldn't of had it before 

297.01 301.00 A: 'cause again i work in special ed and and you know with 

301.75 304.93 A: with like the voice recognition technology emerging 

305.39 309.44 A: a lot of my kids who have dyslexia or other types or 

310.05 311.77 A: learning disabilities 

311.87 316.50 A: you know can now like dictate their papers to the computer 

316.71 317.60 B: okay 

317.13 321.23 A: and of course you know they've always had access to books on tape 

321.42 330.64 A: you know and things like that to assist kids in college with their learning disabilities but with the computer technology's just made it that much easier 

330.24 331.17 B: right 

331.53 333.29 B: now what grades do you teach 

332.94 336.65 A: we have anywhere from fourth grade through high school 

336.31 337.21 B: okay 

336.75 338.94 A: we're a private residential school 

341.67 342.90 A: (( um do )) 

342.21 344.64 B: (( is that i'm sorry go ahead )) 

344.09 346.16 A: (( i was going to ask if you have kids of your own )) 

345.97 347.30 B: no i do not 

347.50 351.06 A: you know if if you've seen the impact first hand one way or the other 

351.50 356.14 B: no i haven't i actually haven't you know other than what i've used it for and stuff 

356.21 358.88 B: um i know i i actually have 

358.97 361.08 B: quite a few nieces and nephews and 

360.41 362.31 A: mhm 

361.21 369.01 B: i know they all use it and i know i mean it's as i said just kind of about the typewriter aspect it's you know when i was younger and doing the papers like that 

368.98 377.94 B: you know i used to get my mom or my dad to help me type it where i know i know like my nieces and nephews nowadays you know they do it all themselves because it is so much easier 

371.72 372.90 A: right 

378.25 383.87 B: just to use the keyboard itself you know on the computer versus an actual typewriter 

379.97 381.27 A: mhm 

384.12 392.33 B: but no i haven't actually seen it i i think some of the downfalls of it is though i do do hear a lot of my um siblings telling me that their children get on 

392.58 399.12 B: just you know get on the internet just to do the chats so it's not being used for an educational purpose which 

395.79 396.85 A: right 

399.30 411.01 B: in my you know in our family's homes i don't think the computer is full you know fully bought for educational purposes it you know was bought for other reasons but i think sometimes they do take too much time when they're at home 

411.14 415.41 B: just to get on the chat lines that are available and you know it's like 

415.45 417.89 B: i don't think it's really affecting any of them 

417.92 420.44 B: but ah once again i don't see it first hand 

420.13 426.97 A: right i know it's you that you know there's a concern that that kids in general are becoming much less active 

427.30 434.80 A: not only because of computers but because of t._v. v._c._r. d._v._d. video games you know all that stuff 

427.36 428.16 B: (( yeah )) 

432.48 433.48 B: right 

435.59 441.76 B: definitely it is i mean it's i i do see it especially with my one nephew i mean he'd rather just you know 

441.82 453.03 B: play the the playstation and the gameboy and stuff like that um now he doesn't actually get on the computer too much but he has all the other games and he does doesn't do the activities the outdoor activities 

454.01 460.21 B: um which once again i don't know how much computers would really affect that you know i guess if you get the games for that too 

460.41 463.21 A: well you know i just know that you know when i was a kid 

463.54 467.55 A: i mean my parents didn't want me want us watching t._v. and there wasn't anything else to do 

467.73 472.11 A: you know i can remember being thrown out of the house on a nice day go play 

470.31 472.01 B: yeah yeah 

472.44 475.09 A: you know we'd have to go out and figure out something to do 

474.84 478.27 B: yep yeah i i remember those days well [laughter] 

478.85 483.46 B: and i don't think there's anything wrong with that i just think kids too nowadays need to be pushed more to 

483.54 487.80 B: go out and do that and not sit in front of the t._v. or wha- you know whatever their 

487.85 489.90 B: other sources and stuff 

489.54 491.21 A: i'll tell you what i 

491.73 503.26 A: was speaking with a first grade teacher the other day and again i don't know if this is this is the function of computers or what it is but she was saying that her kids she's noticed the decrease in 

503.28 506.16 A: creativity over the years 

505.51 506.48 B: oh wow 

506.25 511.81 A: that you know kids are far less imaginative now than they were when she first started teaching 

512.19 517.64 A: and she's ten years older than i am so she's been teaching about twenty five years at least i bet 

519.64 524.37 A: so you know she she says that even when she does an art project she hates to show a model 

524.39 527.64 A: 'cause if she shows them a model they'll do exactly what she's done 

528.44 529.94 B: that's kind of interesting 

529.34 532.20 A: rather than you know trying to trying to 

532.40 534.52 A: do a variation on what she's done 

534.29 535.25 B: right 

535.67 538.64 A: but again i don't know if that's a function of computers or 

538.90 540.28 B: or just even 

540.25 542.98 A: or just you know all the medial bombardment 

542.87 543.86 B: right 

543.89 545.51 B: now do you have any children 

545.26 548.39 A: no i don't just the ones i teach 

546.34 547.26 B: okay 

548.53 550.92 B: [laughter] that's probably enough sometimes 

550.35 553.16 A: it certainly is but um 

553.56 556.72 A: you know it's it's worked out well over the years 

556.81 559.62 A: 'cause again i work at a residential school so 

560.22 568.97 A: um you know i take kids out on weekends sometimes and it's kind of like having grandkids you know it's like if you want a kid i can have a kid if i don't want a kid 

562.96 563.89 B: okay 

568.72 572.35 B: give them back [laughter] that's not a bad deal [laughter] 

569.45 570.68 A: give them back 

572.37 573.53 A: not at all 

574.79 576.17 A: (( not at all )) 

576.41 584.59 B: it is kind of a shame you just kind of sometimes wonder what you know what will happen as we get older and these are this is the generation that will be taking care of us 

584.05 585.10 A: oh i know 

584.80 587.33 B: and it's just kinda like you know what's going to happen 

587.58 591.99 B: as you say you know is it is it the sign of technology that's kinda 

592.01 594.27 B: getting kids less 

594.72 599.89 B: whether it's motivated or innovated you know to to learn and do things on their own
