28.93 30.06 B: um 

30.57 31.87 B: (( and ah as )) 

32.15 36.53 B: far as computers harming or helping education 

36.62 37.82 B: um 

38.42 41.12 B: i guess it depends on the individual

44.85 48.89 B: two sons who or two grandsons who are home schooled 

48.63 50.53 A: (( mhm ))

58.38 62.41 B: doesn't do a lot but the other one is several grades up 

62.40 63.27 A: (( mhm )) 

62.43 67.74 B: and ah he is doing almost all of his classes on the computer now 

67.60 69.04 A: mhm 

68.17 75.28 B: they've bought computer programs and do it and ah it's good in some ways because he can 

75.54 79.95 B: he can go ahead and ah checks his answers 

80.01 85.92 B: that he puts in you know as he goes along on the lesson tells him whether it's right or wrong 

83.45 84.30 A: (( mm )) 

85.98 87.03 B: (( ah )) 

89.06 97.57 B: but a a kid has to be self motivated to do some [laughter] of that stuff too or someone watching over them all the time do 

96.98 99.05 A: yeah 

99.06 101.72 B: you have any experience with ah mhm 

101.16 103.25 A: of course i'm a college student 

103.56 111.44 A: um i think it's ben- beneficial that we have like computers using them and stuff because it helps me 

111.47 117.04 A: you know find stuff that i need help from to be able to type and everything 

117.54 122.90 A: you know i think it's a part of you know education and and it's going to be 

122.97 124.33 A: for a long time 

125.29 127.25 A: that's the way i feel about it 

128.13 136.22 B: it probably depends a lot on on the individual if you if you look things up ah go in and and study and 

136.23 139.46 B: ah ah try to get informations on subjects 

139.05 140.77 A: yeah 

140.22 142.98 B: that's really good ah 

144.36 149.94 B: some individuals would not pursue it as far as others i'm sure 

149.07 150.93 A: (( yeah i know what you're talking about )) 

151.38 161.59 A: that's just like if it's of benefit to me i mean a benefactor to me in a way because like my car just broke down and i'm not going to have any way to get back and forth to um school 

161.23 162.15 B: (( mhm )) 

161.79 164.84 A: so i'm taking all my classes on line through the computer 

164.75 167.19 B: oh so you're doing that from home mhm 

166.63 178.55 A: yes it's a good thing because like the school is actually like sixty miles away and i was driving that until i my um car broke down so it's a benefactor 

171.67 172.82 B: (( mhm )) 

179.61 190.53 B: i i have a couple of friends who are studying for the ministry and they're actually pastoring churches but still studying to be ordained and and ah they're both doing it on line 

190.19 191.37 A: wow 

191.00 193.34 B: right while they pastor 

193.64 194.83 B: and ah 

195.98 197.27 B: so that 

197.50 203.77 B: ah it costs the same amount of money but they're they're working a full time job while they're doing it [laughter] too 

203.29 215.51 A: yeah it's like you can do that at your own pace any time of the night or whatever or on the weekend you don't have to worry about sitting in a class for hours and hours and missing work and stuff when you can um 

215.71 217.61 A: you know do both of them 

217.31 218.84 B: mhm 

218.26 220.14 A: that's the benefactor of it too 

221.68 228.12 B: now ah can ah can you get all of the subjects that you need 

227.50 238.01 A: all the subjects like on line no not that not at the school that i go to not all the subjects but at different schools some of them have all the on line subjects 

237.61 251.00 B: uh-huh that's what i wondered now these particular individuals i know can are getting all of their subjects and ah and they in fact are live both live in pennsylvania and are enrolled in a school in colorado 

238.37 239.26 A: so 

243.32 244.13 A: (( mm )) 

250.72 251.99 A: mhm 

251.78 259.11 B: and and can get everything but ah you in turn can only get part of them then you'll have to go to the school to finish up won't you 

258.94 267.95 A: yeah i was planning to go back because that's what my job is so they understand right now you know my car broke down and stuff i was planning to go back though 

263.71 264.71 B: uh-huh 

268.01 270.77 B: now does it still cost you the same amount for that 

270.61 274.23 A: um i think fifteen dollars extra 

273.21 274.73 B: oh it costs extra 

274.32 276.80 A: that's it just fifteen dollars extra 

276.52 277.22 B: uh-huh 

277.03 280.89 A: per class so that's like um sixty dollars 

281.28 283.25 A: that's it 

282.08 286.71 B: now now if you have a problem can can you get it resolved ah 

286.90 288.71 A: on line or go through the 

287.80 291.66 B: yeah yeah if you're having trouble understanding something or ah 

290.95 297.21 A: you can go through the um go through our offices or her office and they can talk to you about it 

297.27 300.88 B: but you you can't get it ah from home 

300.71 303.19 A: from home oh yeah you can get from home 

302.82 303.69 B: oh 

303.88 316.36 A: either way they'll help you that's just like um when i didn't have on line classes but we can talk to our instructor on line or whatever and if we had any questions or needed any help we he would email us and stuff 

315.99 316.99 B: i see 

316.99 318.82 A: (( yeah )) 

318.65 321.59 B: yeah so that worked out pretty good 

320.49 323.50 A: yeah it is 

322.39 331.51 B: ah i know ah i had a couple of granddaughters that were en- enrolled in a ah computer on line school last year 

331.23 332.72 A: mhm 

331.83 333.56 B: but that didn't 

334.01 336.89 B: ah work out too good they um 

337.59 344.13 B: the ah school itself it was a charter school and they were having difficulty getting the money to operate 

344.27 345.75 A: oh wow 

345.09 346.53 B: (( so ah )) 

346.62 350.14 B: (( they they ended up having to bow out of it because )) 

350.87 353.14 B: it just didn't work out for them it 

353.54 354.74 A: wow 

354.19 359.22 B: sounded like an excellent idea and they they were set they were ah 

356.43 358.46 A: yeah 

359.57 368.31 B: giving computers to each student and ah ah you know sending disks and things and doing everything on line 

366.36 370.58 A: yeah well i guess it's good if they can see if the 

370.64 372.95 A: school have accreditation or something 

373.12 379.19 B: yeah well they were just trying to get started and they were they were having financial trouble they had ah 

379.13 381.02 A: did they have a grant 

380.44 381.56 B: (( ah )) 

382.29 386.98 B: it was a pennsylvania charter school that was supposed to be 

386.82 398.52 B: paid for from the districts where the students enrolled from but but a lot of the districts were balking about giving up the money and sending it and 

392.43 393.36 A: mhm 

398.14 399.29 A: mhm 

398.63 404.72 B: it caused a great shortfall and ah they couldn't pay their teachers and 

404.74 407.90 B: it just just ran into financial trouble 

407.87 411.03 A: (( yeah i understand where you're coming from on that )) 

410.27 421.20 B: but i think this on line would ah i think ah computer education will probably be the thing of the future and i think it will be it's ah good 

420.57 422.99 A: yeah i think so too 

422.71 433.22 B: especially if you have a a wide choice a wide variety of of subjects and ah can get all the help that you need
