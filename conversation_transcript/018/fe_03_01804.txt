2.12 3.25 A: (( hello i'm )) 

3.14 4.33 B: (( hello )) 

4.42 5.41 A: brandy 

5.82 6.86 B: you're who 

6.56 7.57 A: (( brandy )) 

7.60 8.94 B: i'm laryn 

8.72 9.69 A: hi 

11.41 13.40 B: so we're supposed to talk about what 

13.44 15.58 A: um computers in education 

17.18 18.20 B: well 

19.48 21.71 B: i think they're good to a point 

22.62 23.92 B: i think they 

25.51 27.76 B: ah help alleviate the teachers' 

28.81 29.84 B: jobs 

29.88 30.89 B: somewhat 

31.06 32.51 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

31.89 34.90 B: and to a point they're detrimental 

36.42 38.35 A: 'cause they take away pen and paper 

38.55 40.25 B: that's right 

39.71 41.38 A: i feel the same way 

41.68 43.50 B: they take away the brains 

42.84 44.24 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

45.14 48.79 B: 'cause today's kids couldn't add two and two and come up with five 

48.91 49.87 A: nope 

53.48 55.18 A: have you ever done this before [noise] 

55.34 57.45 B: have i done what we're doing now 

56.99 59.54 A: yeah oh okay me either so 

57.66 58.50 B: no 

61.21 62.14 A: um 

63.33 66.29 A: did you get a chance to use a computer in school 

67.41 71.65 B: ah there weren't any such things when i went to school 

71.27 72.35 A: oh okay 

75.48 81.17 A: well i got to use them when i was in school but they weren't as sophisticated as they are now [noise] 

82.03 83.45 A: and 

85.89 87.69 B: well my first ah 

88.21 95.87 B: experience with any type of a computer was when i was in the military and i was a radio teletype operator 

94.65 95.32 A: (( [noise] )) 

95.85 96.83 A: oh okay 

97.23 99.23 B: that's going way back 

102.61 107.54 A: my daughter is in the second grade and she uses a computer at school [noise] 

107.73 109.43 A: and 

111.29 116.32 A: she likes it because she gets to play on the computer there she don't get to play on one here 

117.06 118.64 B: well i have i have 

119.33 121.24 B: nieces and nephews that are 

121.52 124.24 B: a lot more literate than what i am 

123.43 125.54 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

124.91 126.24 B: all i have done 

126.50 129.46 B: is just to teach it by myself 

130.96 135.13 A: well we have [noise] an internet or that we have the internet but 

135.66 136.86 A: it's 

137.85 138.96 A: not that 

138.98 140.03 A: um 

140.50 142.36 A: my daughter don't get to play on it 

143.56 146.21 A: i don't think little kids [noise] should be on it 

146.80 147.67 A: so 

150.61 152.83 B: well they teach it to them in school though 

152.70 153.72 A: yeah 

154.05 157.39 A: but they can get on them and get into 

157.84 159.87 A: [noise] places that they don't need to be on 

160.03 161.31 A: and so 

161.93 165.24 A: i don't think i'm just worried about her getting on to a 

165.35 168.71 A: real bad site though talking to people she don't need to be talking to 

169.49 170.67 A: (( and so [noise] )) 

170.85 172.04 A: but she's only 

170.91 172.19 B: well there 

172.07 172.85 A: huh 

172.22 175.68 B: are there are programs which you can get 

176.34 178.23 B: which you can regulate 

177.87 178.95 A: yeah 

178.31 181.85 B: what your child can get into and can not get into 

181.92 185.88 A: yeah [noise] but kids are getting smarter and they can get past those things 

187.10 188.13 A: and 

188.34 190.45 A: figure out passwords to 

190.52 191.67 A: be able to 

194.33 202.26 A: like she could get in [noise] there and get my password and get on through me and go anywhere on the internet 

203.17 205.95 A: and but she's only eight 

206.19 207.04 B: yeah 

206.74 210.61 A: i don't think [noise] maybe in a few years we might set her up her own little 

210.92 214.44 A: thing with all the regulation 

215.59 217.10 A: but 

218.02 219.01 A: (( i don't know )) 

219.03 220.80 A: i know some kids like 

221.11 223.46 A: [noise] kids that are autistic and stuff 

223.78 224.97 A: um 

225.03 231.91 A: i've got a brother in law that's in the fifth grade and he's autistic and he learns a lot from using a computer 

232.43 233.92 A: (( um [noise] )) 

233.94 237.76 A: but he can't stand for a teacher to stand there and tell him what to do 

238.14 239.12 B: mhm 

238.27 241.40 A: but if they put the computer in front of him 

241.50 247.77 A: and program um a game or something to tell him what to do he'll do it [noise] without any problem 

250.05 252.11 B: well well that's a good point 

251.54 256.62 A: oh yeah he he's very touchy when it comes to people telling him what to do 

257.76 262.22 A: but he likes to play games and [noise] stuff on the computer and 

263.11 267.48 A: so i guess it's got their good points and got their bad points somewhere 

268.87 273.44 B: well yeah because it it doesn't make them use their brains to to look 

273.84 276.35 B: of course they have more ah 

277.54 280.39 B: references available to them 

280.09 281.40 A: [noise] oh yeah 

282.59 283.69 A: yeah 

283.34 286.58 B: so for kids that are in the remote areas that's good 

285.41 286.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

286.94 290.93 A: yeah but when you live three miles from a library it's bad 

291.61 295.40 B: well yeah but when you're eight only eight years old three miles is a long way 

294.87 299.16 A: oh yeah but i don't work so if [noise] she needs to go to the library any time i'll take her 

299.74 302.17 A: and but like when i was a kid 

302.30 305.26 A: we used encyclopedias 

305.51 307.49 A: and 

307.96 308.98 A: (( i don't know )) 

314.64 315.81 A: (( [noise] i don't know )) 

317.18 320.65 B: well i don't know maybe they'll come up some day where 

324.74 328.12 B: you'll just have a press of a button or something and 

329.19 331.27 B: you can get your answers 

333.07 335.00 B: (( how long are we supposed to be talking )) 

334.62 336.15 A: [noise] i think [noise] ten minutes 

336.76 338.49 B: oh lord 

340.46 342.95 A: and they're recording it too so 

343.92 344.88 B: well 

345.39 347.50 A: we're gonna make for a good listen [noise] 

348.71 351.26 A: i don't even remember signing up for this so 

352.58 361.92 B: well i signed up for it a friend of mine emailed me and told me she thought that i would enjoy doing this course i enjoy doing surveys 

361.94 363.25 A: [noise] yeah i do too

372.77 374.73 A: (( and i haven't done a [noise] phone one yet )) 

376.69 378.46 A: but

394.62 395.86 A: but 

396.53 397.61 A: (( i don't know )) 

398.86 406.97 A: probably [noise] here in a few years they won't have any books in school they'll just have computers 

405.13 406.05 B: well 

409.35 410.47 B: i don't know 

411.71 417.54 B: they've they've come up with a new thing where they don't have to cut trees down now to make paper so 

417.24 418.29 A: (( [noise] yeah that's )) 

419.57 420.73 A: that's cool 

425.26 425.82 A: (( [noise] ))

484.81 487.46 A: and and i have them my 

487.63 493.27 A: number [noise] on my card so that they could let their kids get into the library 

495.24 498.38 A: and they thought that that was neat 

498.63 501.88 B: well that's where computers come in good on that part 

503.15 507.51 A: [noise] yeah 'cause their library's like sixty miles from
