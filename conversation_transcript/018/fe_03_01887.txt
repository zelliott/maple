292.08 293.11 A: mhm 

292.13 306.43 B: and it was like i can't sit in bed for six weeks so i ended up sitting on the computer and i just researched them all and once my daughter got old enough to go out with me that's when i started back into it [mn]

316.38 330.09 A: right and that's why i do this for a living yeah that's neat because i got to stay home with my boys when they were young but then as they got up to school age then i had to go out and work and i really miss you know

349.98 353.07 B: [laughter] but i mean oh well who cares 

352.38 361.44 A: exactly 'cause you're going to look back and remember all the time that you got to spend with your daughter not look back and go we didn't have this or we didn't have that because i wasn't working 

360.96 371.28 B: yeah it's and it's one of those things that even like i used to tell people well i don't get to go to the movies anymore [sigh] well you know what i found mystery shopping jobs for the movie theatres

439.80 445.19 A: i don't know if it's because of the area i'm in i just don't you know don't have the opportunity or 

445.73 447.09 A: what it is 

446.62 452.89 B: i don't know we've been getting i get flooded with it it's one of those things when it rains it pours and then 

452.18 456.74 A: right right you just don't have any or mhm yeah 

453.07 455.33 B: it's a famine [laughter] basically

486.01 486.57 B: (( [sigh] )) 

488.50 494.07 B: i don't even want to think of how much formula would cost we don't do the formula so 

493.42 505.92 A: right well see my daughter-in-law wasn't going to and then she decided to so i got on all the baby sites i could find and she's been getting formula in the mail and really wonderful coupons but oh 

504.52 511.85 B: [sigh] well you know the trick is to with those this is horrible [laughter] this is this is really bad 'cause i don't ever causing these things but oh well 

510.63 512.74 A: (( [laughter] )) 

512.05 516.78 B: you can sign up under multiple names with the same address 

516.88 526.69 B: so she should actually sign up herself sign up her daughter sign up you under her address and then put them all under your address as well 

520.88 524.96 A: i know i yes because i've got it coming i've got it 

526.81 534.50 A: right because i've got 'em kind of coming here i've got 'em going to the kids' house i've got 'em going to my best friend's house i've got 'em going to the other grandparents' house 

532.18 533.29 B: and you can have 

534.25 537.33 B: and you can use more than one name at each address 

537.78 538.94 A: right 

537.86 540.86 B: because because when i was getting the sample 

540.99 546.52 B: of like the cans i ended up donating mine to like a food shop because i'm like i'm never going to use 

541.07 541.88 A: (( [mn] )) 

545.28 547.93 A: because you just get too many right right
