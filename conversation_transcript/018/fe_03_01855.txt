2.45 3.51 B: hello 

3.11 4.40 A: hello 

4.35 5.19 B: hello 

5.04 6.03 A: hello 

5.92 6.78 B: hi 

6.62 8.20 A: hi my name is betsy 

8.04 9.15 B: my name is ray 

8.85 9.67 A: hi 

10.75 13.71 B: okay this is my first time doing this i don't really know what i'm doing 

13.23 19.91 A: yeah well likewise but um i guess the question is ah do computers enhance or harm education 

19.82 20.95 B: right 

20.67 23.29 A: i don't or improve it's improve 

23.24 23.97 B: (( okay )) 

23.71 25.73 A: whatever um so what do you think 

25.77 28.45 B: i think it improves education 

28.32 29.43 A: it does 

29.34 30.61 B: i think so 

30.40 31.29 A: yeah 

31.65 35.52 B: ah it just is it just computers or the internet as a whole or 

37.08 39.84 B: (( what do you ah how do you take the question to be )) 

39.59 48.25 A: um i the whole thing you know anything that gives you ac- ah you gain access to using a computer whether it be software or the internet or what have you 

48.44 50.63 B: (( well i think it improves education because )) 

50.72 54.26 B: it makes things a lot easier and it just makes it faster 

54.27 57.37 B: and allows people to learn a lot more 

58.44 64.41 A: i think it can be used to enhance a person's education but i think if you rely on it too much you miss the basics 

64.41 74.74 A: and you know what they say garbage in garbage out same thing um you know if you wanted to solve a complicated math problem you need to know you still need to know basic math to understand what you're doing 

67.56 69.27 B: right 

74.82 82.41 B: oh i totally agree i don't think that i mean obviously you can't just you know type it in and you know get the answer you should know exactly what you're doing but 

81.81 85.10 A: yeah in other words it's not a substitute for you know the basics 

85.18 89.65 B: yeah it shouldn't be a substitute for education it should just help enhance it improve ability 

87.74 89.06 A: yes exactly 

89.45 93.58 A: well i think a lot of people look at um computer usage as as 

93.71 101.15 A: the the answer to our problems the problems that we have with education today and certain kids not being well educated 

101.29 109.56 A: hence you have this rush to get you know a gazillion computers in schools where um performance just hasn't been up to snuff at all 

109.53 110.72 B: mhm 

110.14 112.22 A: on testing so 

112.23 117.91 A: i'm not sure that it's the the best answer like i say i think it's a useful tool just like anything else but 

118.13 121.77 A: um i don't think it's going to solve the problems that we have with our education 

122.12 123.03 A: system 

123.21 126.66 A: um what experience do you have with using computers 

123.31 124.58 B: (( probably not )) 

127.21 128.10 B: i 

128.24 131.77 B: (( have used computers for the past fifteen years of my life i guess )) 

131.58 134.06 A: could you could you speak up just a bit please 

133.42 137.80 B: i was saying i've used computers for the last like what twelve years of my life i use a computer every day 

138.02 139.01 A: really 

138.78 140.53 B: yeah 

139.96 141.92 A: and what do you do with um 

141.95 143.79 A: is it part of your job or 

144.07 145.74 B: actually i'm a student 

145.26 146.60 A: oh you're a student 

146.27 147.65 B: yeah so i mean 

147.70 149.56 B: it's my everyday life 

149.51 150.63 A: really 

150.19 151.69 B: (( checking emails and )) 

151.78 153.23 B: whatnot 

152.45 155.20 A: oh god i know keeping in touch with the rest of the world 

154.92 159.23 B: yeah the email is just i mean i think that's one of the things that's really enhanced is the fact that you can 

159.27 165.33 B: send an email and get in touch with fifteen people at the exact same time instead of having to call each person and tell them something 

164.74 165.55 A: (( well )) 

165.62 166.91 A: that's true 

167.11 177.99 A: it's funny 'cause as far as a a work tool is concerned i don't know how i could do my job without it but um i'm still on the fence as far as you know it being the best thing in the world for education 

178.85 179.87 A: um 

179.23 182.74 B: well i think if used properly it can be 

182.66 183.70 A: mhm 

183.71 184.70 B: so 

184.87 187.57 B: overall it's like you know if the question was 

187.60 192.02 B: would you if you were having a if you had a school would you want to have computers in it 

191.43 192.71 A: oh definitely 

192.45 193.66 B: i mean you know 

193.05 198.18 A: yeah if and to anybody who's going to work in today's society needs to know how to use a computer 

197.90 199.04 B: (( exactly )) 

198.44 199.50 A: for sure 

199.71 204.72 B: so overall i think it does enhance the whole education system and the education of individuals 

199.78 200.70 A: um 

204.91 210.91 B: but if used improperly it could hinder your learning ability aptitude and the like i mean you name it 

211.45 212.36 A: yes 

212.43 213.56 A: definitely 

214.57 217.07 A: gee i think we've covered the topic thoroughly 

216.67 218.27 B: i think so too 

217.70 221.80 A: i know i don't know how [laughter] how how do we go on for ten minutes on this 

221.58 225.13 B: i have no clue i know some of the other topics are a lot ah 

222.42 223.19 A: i 

225.42 228.67 B: easier to debate upon or you know get into it 

227.78 229.59 A: discuss at least yes 

229.12 233.51 B: yeah i mean education is i mean to me it's kinda clear 

234.21 236.24 B: as far as with the answers to the question 

235.93 239.23 A: i don't think there's an issue of answer it's just a matter of pretty much of opinion 

239.18 240.24 B: yeah i mean 

239.47 240.03 A: (( [mn] )) 

240.35 243.11 B: our opinions seem to coincide with each other so 

242.81 246.04 A: yeah to for the most part they um 

246.95 253.77 A: they really narrow when they initially called me they said the topic was education and i have a gazillion things to say about education but they 

253.79 260.07 A: narrowed the topic down extremely by saying what do you think about computer usage in schools i'm like oh okay [laughter] 

259.94 261.74 B: well how about what do you think ah 

261.86 264.54 B: at what age should kids start using a computer in school 

264.73 270.34 A: um well i think they should be introduced at a very early age just for um 

270.14 272.84 B: early as in like first or second grade or 

272.32 274.73 A: ah yes because um 

274.60 287.67 A: unfortunately yes i i do i do believe so because kids start getting on to the internet very quickly and um one of the things that i found is that you know younger children they start getting on to the internet by themselves and 

280.23 282.04 B: mhm 

287.59 294.64 A: they read all sorts of anybody can have a say on the internet and they don't have to be you know very smart or 

291.31 292.87 B: right 

294.53 306.17 A: even very ethical and anybody can say anything that they want to and kids go out to these websites and they think that what they're reading is absolute fact when a lot of that stuff is just garbage of it's someone's opinion 

306.34 310.08 A: and um no being able to it's like it's like being able to 

309.97 322.65 A: go to a library and use that correctly you have to know your sources you have to understand your sources their background their education the same thing with being accessing information off the internet you have to know 

322.51 336.05 A: who that person is what their background is why they should be considered an expert in that field and um the kids learn how to use the library at a very early age and so i think they should start um learning how to use 

335.91 339.53 A: the computer in the same way be introduced in the same way 

339.64 341.45 A: so perhaps it wouldn't be such a 

341.49 346.62 A: fascination that it was i mean kids have a tendency to get on line and do things that they shouldn't 

346.63 347.91 A: let's just put it that way 

346.98 352.86 B: right you don't you don't think that leads to them doing having a lot of shortcuts as far as ah 

353.02 354.97 B: classes like math 

355.30 366.86 B: math is like you know the primary thing that i'm thinking of if you can type in anything on you know any like excel program and get an answer to something you know don't really have to understand the basic concepts behind it and that's just my 

365.46 374.63 A: well that the the i don't think that that isn't a oh god i don't even like them using calculators in classrooms for math let alone a computer 

374.44 375.38 B: right 

375.45 379.02 A: you know one of the things that i find is that you know 

379.05 385.17 A: you know just even with fractions percentages and decimals i mean they can't do them in their head 

385.08 399.91 A: you know they they always have to have that calculator and they have no idea if they're spitting the wrong answer out because they've plugged the wrong numbers in and you should be able to put in numbers and have some reasonable idea of what the answer what the answer is going to be close to 

385.08 386.02 B: right 

399.87 409.27 A: and if you know your math then you know what that answer is i'm not saying it's a substitute i'm just saying they should learn how to use it properly at a young age 

409.12 410.39 B: okay i agree 

409.36 417.76 A: you know they need to be introduced to it and introduced to it you know the same way that you introduce kids to reading writing and arithmetic and 

417.74 429.87 A: here's another tool you use a library as a tool to do your research and and get sources for papers whatever and you use this computer here to get another source of information 

429.76 440.03 A: but i think they need to be taught at a young age and kids basically the kids are fascinated with computers so the sooner you introduce them to the proper use the better off they'll be 

429.81 430.98 B: right 

440.28 445.46 A: you know there i mean there's all sorts of software out there for the little kids they um 

441.04 442.45 B: (( i agree )) 

445.91 456.36 A: they start touting it at a very very early age so if the schools are going to be on board with you know computer usage well you know start at a young age and teach them how to use it wisely 

456.29 458.15 B: mhm 

458.29 459.18 A: (( so i don't know )) 

459.09 463.12 B: yeah i totally agree i mean i agree in that sense overall computers 

463.17 467.11 B: (( definitely enhances the whole learning experience and can definitely make things a lot better )) 

467.35 480.23 A: it's really my my my son has been telling me all through junior high school and high school that we had to have access to the internet and i was no i was not happy about that and we have a computer but i just didn't want access to the internet 

480.19 489.00 A: and ah i have that at work and i really don't need it at home and he said he couldn't possibly get through high school without it and low and behold he has 

488.93 490.20 B: mm oh he has 

489.60 500.51 A: yes he has and he's done very very well for himself too i mean it's just old fashioned research going to the library and you know if worst comes to the worst i look up stuff for him on at work or 

500.44 509.30 A: um he'll go to one of his friends' house or he'll we they have a you know very sophisticated lab computer lab at his high school so he can go there and look the stuff up also 

509.44 517.95 A: but you know when you've got you know a kid that's home by himself all the time and you know 'cause i work full time and there's access to the internet 

515.23 515.77 B: (( a )) 

517.96 522.17 A: you know i mean when they're young you just worry about that 

521.58 523.51 B: lot of garbage comes off the internet 

523.08 530.79 A: oh lot a lot a garbage and they have these websites where kids write gossip down and it just gets distributed all over the place too and i was just 

530.88 532.67 A: some of the stuff that was out there was 

532.80 534.14 A: just pretty appalling 

534.11 541.79 B: yeah it's pretty yeah i totally agree with you on the strength of that the internet is definitely something you need as far as a research tool goes but 

536.64 537.41 A: (( mm )) 

542.13 544.63 B: (( it's a lot of you waste a lot of time with it )) 

544.38 550.57 A: oh definitely definitely um no um are you in college 

550.28 551.52 B: (( yeah i'm in college )) 

551.10 555.34 A: yeah are you um what are you studying with ah computers 

554.71 557.08 B: well i'm a business major 

556.67 557.98 A: (( oh are you really )) 

558.63 560.02 A: oh good for you 

559.77 562.35 B: so i mean i pretty much have to use a computer every day 

562.30 564.84 A: yeah well i i would imagine you would be 

564.76 565.52 B: so 

566.10 567.69 A: now where do you go to school 

567.62 569.10 B: um university of texas 

568.84 570.92 A: oh really are you calling from texas
