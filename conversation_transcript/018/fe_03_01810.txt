0.19 1.34 B: hi 

1.45 2.58 B: i'm tony 

2.15 3.58 A: hi tony how are you 

3.38 5.32 B: all right what was the topic again 

4.98 12.10 A: the topic was whether computers enhance education whether they help with the educational system within the country 

11.99 14.25 B: (( [mn] okay what do you think )) 

14.74 27.75 A: uh i think they're they're a major part of the educational system and the amount of information that's available to people that are in in school is incredible and there you are with the internet the world wide search you can pretty much find anything you want 

18.25 19.15 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

27.96 32.62 A: without even leaving your your home or your school and the 

32.85 36.13 A: ultimate goal is to is to get as much information as you can to 

36.06 48.01 A: make our lives as easy as possible i mean you certainly have the option then to to go to libraries in search of other books but what the computer can do is just remarkable when you look at the amount of time that that you and i spent when we were at school 

41.51 42.21 B: (( mm )) 

47.91 49.00 B: (( yeah i know )) 

48.25 51.30 A: going going to libraries and xeroxing 

51.34 55.01 A: and using mic- the micro- microfilm 

54.66 55.83 B: mhm 

55.20 60.71 A: and making copies of that so i think uh educational purposes can help to help people of all ages 

60.87 61.80 A: and there is 

62.01 72.90 A: [mn] there are programs for for children that have learning learning differences that can help them get through school in a much easier way so i think it's very positive what do you think big tony 

72.42 79.18 B: [noise] uh well let's see uh i work in an office and i work on a computer all day [laughter] and i'm doing 

78.04 79.65 A: [laughter] 

79.14 91.65 B: i'm doing computer networking now so no i think it's it is good but then also i think to a certain extent it's going to take the kids away 

92.12 95.43 B: from going to the library and doing things 

95.45 99.65 B: you know manually and will kind of make them lazy in a way 

99.71 103.90 B: it's just like you have in the video games that we have like x. box and stuff 

103.80 113.06 B: and i know me growing up you know coming from a poor family we had to make our toys and we were always out in the streets you know having fun with our friends but 

112.16 113.49 A: mhm 

112.89 126.28 B: most of the kids nowadays are always at home either on the computer or on the video games because like my uh stepdaughter first thing she does when she comes in is she hops on the computer and she iming everybody 

126.29 130.20 B: and she's not doing nothing else it's either the computer or the phone 

130.84 138.83 B: you know and i mean it it has i believe it has plus to it and it also is going to have this negative effect on society kids 

131.48 132.41 A: mm but 

138.80 145.45 A: but as far as it's not so much what it's going to have what it's going to have an effect on on society but what about for educational purposes 

138.99 139.86 B: (( you know [cough] )) 

145.12 147.07 B: oh for educational oh 

145.81 150.24 A: for educational purposes i understand what you're saying as far as society is concerned where children 

149.04 153.61 B: yeah well for educational yeah of course i mean a kid at school can 

153.61 160.40 B: you know learn everything they have to learn on the internet talk to other people who's in class somewhere else you know 

160.25 169.90 B: i mean that's what i use the internet for i get for educational purposes i mean i get all my information now because i go to school you know go to junior college 

169.07 170.22 A: what are you studying 

170.08 172.70 B: oh i'm studying to be a a drug and alcohol counselor 

172.17 174.06 A: mhm 

173.09 174.49 B: and um 

174.50 182.29 A: that's pretty pretty amazing what you can pull up off the internet that would help you with your with your studies and just general information about what your career is going to be i 

174.80 175.91 B: [cough] i mean 

181.17 186.63 B: yeah mhm but it saves me time to going to the library too [laughter] 

184.59 188.15 A: understand it saves you days and days and days hours and hours and hours 

188.43 189.36 A: that you can 

188.48 192.78 B: well also too also too i mean i have been on the internet to where 

192.88 205.39 B: when i'm looking for something i don't get exactly what i'm looking for and that costs a lot of time too causes me to be on there a lot of time when i really want to get in there and get out you know what i'm saying 

204.88 208.54 A: so the search engines don't always take you to the point that you want to go to 

208.46 209.85 B: yeah 

209.36 215.81 A: and you wind up going around searching until you find the right web site that you need to retrieve that information from 

211.14 212.30 B: right a circle 

213.11 214.65 B: (( mhm mm )) 

215.69 218.59 B: yeah and someti- and then sometimes they say if they 

218.78 222.19 B: ask for educational purposes i was going

233.86 241.07 B: you know i'm saying so i mean it's great i'm not going to deny that it it won't help the kids you know
