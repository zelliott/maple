185.60 187.49 A: (( mhm i know )) 

186.82 189.17 B: because everybody is nineteen years old 

188.96 190.58 A: that's what i do um 

190.84 204.96 A: i had a few like a few part time jobs and i needed to know like excel so i would hurry up and go join the library grab a book and practice on it before i got the job so i didn't look totally stupid like i don't know what that is 

204.89 206.93 A: so i knew the basics [noise] 

207.03 212.18 A: i never actually went to a one of those classes either i just kind of tried to learn on my own 

212.01 216.06 B: how long did it take you to like ma- finally get like pretty good 

215.19 216.20 A: (( um )) 

216.52 218.66 A: not that long say about a month 

218.84 222.89 A: in my spare time i would be on my computer practising different stuff so 

223.78 228.41 B: so now [mn] when your daughter goes to school she uses the c- computer every day 

228.74 230.92 B: they have computers in the classroom 

230.55 233.46 A: [noise] yeah she has a couple of courses um 

234.66 238.98 A: [lipsmack] i know she had the typing but then they put her on computer keyboard now instead of typing 

239.12 240.67 A: they changed it to keyboarding 

240.48 242.43 B: what does that mean i don't know what that means 

241.87 244.64 A: instead of you know how you're typing in school 

244.27 245.28 B: mhm 

244.66 247.45 A: now they teach you on the computer it's called keyboarding 

247.67 250.40 B: so you learn how to type at the same time you mean 

249.74 251.27 A: mhm yeah 

250.88 256.50 B: yeah but the problem but who who needs who needs how to know how to type the y- you don't see typewriters any more 

256.95 260.07 A: yeah well they changed it over to computers so 

260.68 262.47 A: they do everything on there 

261.94 263.56 B: is she she as fast as you 

264.04 265.80 A: oh no she's much better 

265.36 266.64 B: oh you're kidding 

265.99 277.97 A: yeah she's great [laughter] it's embarrassing yes it is especially when she's standing behind me i get so self self conscious it's like here type this for me [laughter] it'll be done in one minute i'll be here for half an hour 

267.47 269.38 B: (( oh is that embarrassing for me uh uh )) 

277.41 280.75 B: and what do you think she'll be able to do when she grows up with a computer 

280.79 282.82 A: oh she knows pretty much now 

283.24 289.10 B: you know could you imagine twenty years ago nobody even knew about i mean not maybe like twenty five years ago 

288.63 289.80 A: mhm 

289.15 291.74 B: computers were nothing now all of a sudden 

291.63 292.85 A: it's everything 

292.37 302.90 B: its i don't i remember there used to be this thing call univac this giant computer right that was like like as as big as a truck and that was like the biggest thing on t._v. and everything 

296.48 298.18 A: mhm yeah 

302.32 303.26 A: mhm 

303.02 307.54 B: and now computers are so small compared like the size of portable t._v.s 

307.19 308.24 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

307.61 310.08 B: i mean you can even get real tiny ones right

326.37 328.36 B: (( what h- h- how how do you do that )) 

327.99 333.15 A: i've never actually done it now we got a d._v._d. player in our computer and i've never used it 

332.85 334.17 B: what does that mean 

334.13 338.57 A: i can download a movie and instead of watching it on t._v. watch it on my computer which 

338.73 342.42 A: i don't i wouldn't i don't get that i'd rather watch it on t._v. it's a bigger screen 

343.35 346.04 A: but i guess to copy it and 

346.64 349.49 A: a movie you want to see and that's already in your d._v._d. player

352.98 354.94 B: h- how do you do that 

355.09 363.03 A: uh well there's a lot of web sites you can go on and just download the music and play it on your computer like um instead of having a c._d. player 

363.81 366.53 A: just like that and then you can burn your own c._d. 

367.17 369.03 B: (( mhm and l- let me ask you a question )) 

368.70 369.56 A: mhm 

369.20 372.98 B: if you go to a web site right and you get stuff off them

400.08 411.17 B: if you want to find out about a subject like on a computer how does that work [mn] is there a thing like you go to a si- there's a thou- ten thousand subjects or something you go look up is there a thing that lists like ten thousand subjects you go to 

402.78 403.66 A: mhm 

411.70 413.75 A: uh what do you mean if you want to look 

412.64 417.85 B: [mn] like i know that computers have every weird subject you could imagine to find 

416.99 418.44 A: mhm 

417.76 428.29 B: okay let's say you wanted to find [mn] pick some weird subject like um purple flowers or something okay how would you go about finding out everything you wanted to know about purple flowers 

423.28 424.26 A: yeah 

428.27 431.24 A: [noise] what i usually do when i want to find something is 

431.56 434.12 A: just go on to like m._s._n. 

434.56 436.72 A: the web search and just type it in 

436.78 440.95 A: [noise] and then push search like purple flower or they do have 

439.27 441.83 B: explain that to me i i don't i don't know what that means 

442.71 449.88 A: it's called a search engine you just go on and type in a word or a phrase and you push search and it brings up everything 

450.38 454.11 A: and every web site that has something do with purple flowers 

454.18 455.12 B: really

472.14 473.42 A: in the computer 

473.20 477.71 B: a- a- and and what does it mean you have to buy all this kind of software too if you have a computer 

476.82 490.71 A: [noise] usually when you you buy a computer package there is a bunch of software in it but the cheaper you go [noise] the less software it has so then you're after spending like sixty dollars for one program they're they are pretty expensive [noise] 

489.82 493.24 B: you have to buy something that's called windows or something like that 

493.12 495.20 A: that's usually installed on 

495.38 497.10 A: a computer when you buy it

515.15 516.21 A: (( that )) 

515.66 518.27 B: what do you use your computer for mainly 

518.81 521.80 A: email and 

522.70 528.74 A: just to mess around like type and find out stupid things or if i'm bored 

527.38 529.23 B: can you tell me how email works 

530.76 533.62 A: actually well all you do is 

533.67 541.81 A: is in in place of sending a letter [noise] and it's instant you know you don't have to wait three days for a message to get somewhere 

538.76 539.41 B: (( and )) 

540.69 543.78 B: and how does somebody know if they got a message they have to look 

543.88 545.68 A: yeah 

545.62 547.98 B: (( and and and how do you keep it private )) 

548.25 552.14 A: well the one we have is m._s._n. you have to have a password to get on there 

552.03 553.71 B: oh so you pick a password 

553.28 554.55 A: mhm 

553.92 560.96 B: and then so if you want to write a guy like [mn] [mn] [mn] in private he has a password and you could write to him 

560.41 565.96 A: it's on your on your system alone you have to have a password to get in it and user name 

566.37 569.81 A: but on certain systems like if you go to a local area 

569.83 578.58 A: connection to get on the internet your whole family can get on there and everybody can see your email but the one we have you have to have your own password to get in 

578.79 580.79 A: for every certain person in 

580.93 584.08 A: your household so it's a little bit more private [sigh] 

584.49 585.49 B: okay 

585.23 586.14 A: so 

585.79 588.55 B: this conversation has got to be more than ten minutes hasn't 

588.00 589.29 A: i know 

589.15 590.83 B: (( it do you think they forgot us do )) 

590.15 591.77 A: [noise] [noise] what was that 

591.61 593.28 B: you think they forgot to shut it off 

593.15 596.44 A: i i don't know it's been it's been like ten minutes huh 

596.16 598.37 B: i know but i'm afraid if we hang up it won't work 

598.11 599.50 A: [noise] yeah 

599.10 599.95 B: what do you think
