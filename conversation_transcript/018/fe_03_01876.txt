200.28 203.33 B: anyway she loves it there 

203.02 206.94 A: so she doesn't get to be around your parents your family then

210.23 212.44 B: yeah we lost um 

212.62 216.09 B: well our father died in eighty four

222.51 224.06 B: and um 

224.55 237.04 B: [lipsmack] anyway she um she was had a really good spirit [laughter] but she had heart problems and um [lipsmack] she was really a tough cookie 

231.66 232.82 A: right 

237.20 240.54 B: and never complained at all 

240.62 242.53 B: but she um 

242.20 243.76 A: so were you close to her at all 

243.69 250.87 B: yes yes and um as a matter of fact i was with her when she passed away and i felt 

244.83 246.60 A: oh right 

249.34 250.50 A: mm 

251.23 255.50 B: that i i was the only one that was there at that time 

255.56 257.57 B: and i felt 

257.89 259.45 B: very fortunate 

259.30 261.20 A: mhm mhm 

259.89 266.70 B: and i can't explain it i've you know have never experienced anything like that before and um 

267.90 275.12 B: in a way i thought it was easier on me than it was on my siblings you know with her passing 

273.47 278.86 A: right because you were right you had time to accept it and you had time to deal with it better 

278.57 281.17 B: well i saw that you know she 

281.23 282.92 B: died peacefully 

282.57 283.28 A: right 

282.93 290.24 B: and um that was very important well to all of us but anyway i was there and um 

289.05 294.09 A: that's the sad part about a family because when you have to lose your family members it's like no other 

293.85 295.08 B: [mn] i 

294.19 299.80 A: 'cause we're so close to them that it it's just so hard to to lose them like that 

295.32 299.02 B: (( i know yeah )) 

299.16 301.13 B: yeah 

300.58 304.06 A: it you know a part of us goes i think with them [laughter] [noise] 

303.57 311.02 B: [mn] yeah yeah but then at the same time you feel you have this feeling that they're still there with you 

310.95 312.79 A: right [noise] right 

311.73 313.21 B: and um 

313.96 319.63 B: i didn't have any unresolved issues with my mom 

319.66 324.28 B: and um a couple of my siblings did i mean it wasn't 

319.70 321.45 A: (( good good )) 

323.86 324.78 A: yeah 

324.55 325.99 B: you know um 

326.04 331.85 B: [lipsmack] but anyway and i i i'm sorry that they did i think that that's hard 

326.52 327.84 A: that's sad 

330.20 331.09 A: right 

331.68 333.81 A: mhm yeah 

334.08 344.33 A: well i i think i think you know in order for your family to mean a lot to you you've really got to work at it [laughter] sometimes it doesn't come easy i mean you have to you have to be forgiving 

340.34 341.96 B: that's true 

342.51 343.85 B: that's true 

344.26 352.49 A: and you have to be giving and you have to just you know not not hold grudges or else you know that bonding won't even be there any more 

352.28 354.64 B: that that's very true 

354.75 356.26 A: you know and 

355.32 357.16 B: do you still have your parents 

357.49 361.38 A: just my mom and she's ninety so you know we won't have her 

359.98 362.44 B: oh bless her heart 

361.52 364.58 A: yeah i know she's in a home right now we have her 

363.71 365.78 B: is she close to where you are 

365.26 371.11 A: yeah and we have her well taken of you know because she needs to be taken care of but she too will be passing on 

369.14 370.22 B: yeah 

371.29 374.10 B: oh yeah 

371.30 372.69 A: soon i'm sure

395.53 397.75 B: oh really oh 

396.31 401.04 A: yeah so that's you know that it does happen now [laughter] 

398.19 399.19 B: yeah 

399.64 408.81 B: yeah my ah ex husband lives in florida and um he lives up by or orlando and oh 

403.54 404.94 A: (( oh [noise] )) 

407.72 410.53 A: oh that's nice up there it's much nicer than down here 

410.25 411.49 B: (( really )) 

410.90 417.15 A: oh yeah down here is [mn] a mess [laughter] 

416.23 426.73 B: anyway um he and my sister my ex husband and my sister ah they see each other and you know every so often they're not that close to each other but 

424.02 425.09 A: oh 

426.81 431.86 B: um anyway they do um stay in touch which is fine with me 

431.55 433.16 A: mhm mhm 

432.54 435.90 B: and even if i did divorce him he is a nice person 

435.70 438.60 A: right right well at least you didn't have any children 

436.05 439.98 B: (( [laughter] but i had my reasons [laughter] )) 

438.92 451.25 A: right but at least you didn't have any children [noise] because when you have children and you divorce it's a very difficult thing and they're very affected [noise] because i did i i i was divorced i'm married now but i was divorced and it really hurt my son 

442.87 444.31 B: yes 

446.66 447.44 B: (( [mn] )) 

450.97 454.32 B: oh yeah 

451.73 456.89 A: a lot and it it's just not a good thing so you are very blessed not to have had children 

456.19 458.34 B: yeah well i've always 

457.11 459.98 A: [noise] unless you were going to stay with your mate 

458.89 460.66 B: (( [laughter] )) 

460.25 463.19 A: it's hard enough but then when you have to divorce 

461.63 470.83 B: i've always said god knew what he was doing when he didn't give me any children because i would have spoilt them rotten [laughter] oh 

465.04 466.61 A: there you go 

467.47 473.31 A: oh [laughter] oh well it's hard to be a single mom you know 

472.84 474.66 B: i i'm sure 

473.72 478.96 A: and then you really do need your family then i mean i i was a single mom for sixteen years 

476.33 477.12 B: yeah 

477.73 480.53 B: [cough] really [mn] 

479.24 489.83 A: yeah and it was very very hard on one person it does really take two and that's another reason why families are so important because it takes really two of you to raise a family [noise] 

481.70 483.41 B: oh wow 

489.36 490.80 B: yeah 

490.06 492.65 A: and one it just doesn't work too well 

492.76 493.96 B: yeah 

493.31 495.57 A: sometimes it doesn't work at all [laughter] 

494.99 496.93 B: yeah yeah that's 

496.30 504.89 A: most of the time it doesn't work at all unless you have your immediate family helping you like your mom and your dad [cough] and you know they have the grandparents to influence them 

501.02 502.09 B: yeah 

504.80 506.31 B: yes yes 

505.52 513.81 A: and and i think that for especially for a boy it's so important to have a grandfather you know to help and you know then they seem to come out better 

508.84 509.70 B: yeah 

513.77 515.15 B: yeah yeah 

514.31 517.66 A: but i didn't really have that at all and um 

515.98 516.63 B: [cough] 

517.24 518.75 B: i think um 

519.19 528.43 B: the influence of good grandparents is important even if the parents stay married [laughter] ah 

522.37 524.87 A: oh very important 

525.74 540.09 A: that's oh that's right that's right because grandparents have a way of just loving kids like parents don't [laughter] they have more patience and more time and it's just different and they they know they've learned a lot from their own mistakes and so they ah 

531.25 532.40 B: yeah 

533.01 534.01 B: yeah 

535.88 536.81 B: (( yeah )) 

538.00 539.07 B: (( [cough] )) 

539.86 545.76 A: they know what to do now with the kids it's kind of late for them but they can always give it to their grandkids right 

542.60 543.59 B: right 

543.71 544.79 B: [laughter] 

545.18 545.95 B: [cough] 

546.50 550.57 B: oh pardon me um have you done a lot of phone calls 

550.09 555.52 A: no i just started and i don't really even understand them [laughter] 

553.85 554.92 B: (( [cough] )) 

556.16 559.40 B: oh pardon me i'm sitting here by an open window 

558.06 558.85 A: um 

558.91 562.33 A: tell tell me how how do you get paid the ten dollars do you know 

562.28 575.38 B: um i did the first phone call in january and those ah checks ah they sent a letter about it they're supposed to be coming out within the next week or two 

573.94 580.81 A: are you supposed to do this on different telephones and that's how you get paid or something five different phones i didn't understand that [noise] [noise] 

579.75 580.82 B: um 

580.98 581.94 B: i ha- 

582.08 590.11 B: i know they have something about doing five different phones but i haven't gotten an email on doing that 

590.28 591.07 B: (( ah )) 

590.39 593.47 A: do you still get paid if you don't do it on five different phones 

593.48 597.09 B: no i i don't think so but i'm 

597.19 599.89 B: the way mine is set up i'm only given
