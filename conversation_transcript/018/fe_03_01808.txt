0.54 3.51 B: hey good afternoon my name is hank 

3.10 4.86 A: hi i'm patricia 

4.60 9.13 B: hi patricia what do you think of uh u- using computers and education 

8.88 20.04 A: [laughter] to tell you the truth i don't know if i have a big opinion about it um i suppose it can be good i'm not you know as long it's not dependent on too much to replace people 

19.68 21.89 B: do you have school age children 

21.73 23.29 A: no i don't do you 

23.05 24.79 B: no no no no no no 

25.20 33.25 B: but i have grandchildren that use them and uh it's just amazing the things that they can well it you know can replace a library 

33.08 35.03 A: yeah that's a good point i mean 

35.49 42.23 A: when back in the old days if we had to go to the the library to do research papers and things now you can do it on the internet [laughter] 

38.41 39.60 B: [laughter] 

41.29 47.09 B: yeah and i lived in a small town the library was about as big as a closet so there wasn't 

47.22 52.22 B: you know a lot of choice the school had a library and it was very incomplete 

52.06 53.12 A: yeah 

52.47 65.10 B: and i i don't know the thing is i think it's instantaneous you know [noise] if uh i know that i've helped my grandson with some projects and he needed needed information about iraq 

65.49 66.64 A: about what 

66.43 68.96 B: about iraq the country 

68.48 70.47 A: oh okay i'm sorry i didn't 

70.03 81.34 B: and we got the information in twenty seconds [laughter] you know that's uh you can't quite get in your car and drive to the library and then you know go through the reference section it's really amazing 

74.11 74.82 A: (( mm )) 

80.98 82.08 A: yeah 

81.96 85.75 B: i'm sort of against the use of them for games 

85.69 90.43 A: well then that's what i was um thinking of i think that sometimes 

90.45 97.39 A: they develop educational games which i think can be good to a point but sometimes it think it might be 

97.94 98.92 A: um 

99.00 102.38 A: used too much or you know relied on too much 

102.18 106.68 B: yeah can they can be a waste of time i think uh maybe 

106.76 115.21 B: you know it depends on the game but some of them are you know three quarters entertainment and twenty five per cent education 

114.67 116.00 A: yeah 

115.38 120.61 B: i agree i think would be much better if they were tilted more towards education 

121.39 122.77 B: and not 

122.86 130.13 B: um i know that my granddaughter and grandson they limit t._v. ti- i mean community computer time 

130.18 138.25 B: uh for non educational purposes you know unless he's doing research or things like that he can only use a computer one hour a day 

134.98 136.35 A: mhm 

138.90 139.84 A: that's 

140.50 144.98 A: that's a good idea i would think you know to have some type of limit 

144.10 146.98 B: oh you know they got to get the kids outside 

146.46 147.62 A: yeah 

147.21 153.79 B: and i just uh they're a wonderful tool and they are a good instrument but they are not an end in themselves 

153.86 154.97 A: yeah 

155.30 156.27 A: um 

156.80 161.40 A: that's what i i'm just thinking to myself i'm a computer programmer 

161.20 162.92 B: oh wow [laughter] 

161.24 173.61 A: um [laughter] and but i've not you know developed you know educational software or anything but um so you know i would hate to see them [laughter] go kapooie but [laughter] yeah it's 

173.93 176.94 A: i think we kind of sound like we have similar 

177.11 184.57 A: ideas on it as far as that they can be beneficial but um i agree that the computer 

181.72 187.33 B: i just you know i resisted getting a computer very much because i just couldn't see the need for one 

187.74 197.74 B: and uh then i was convinced to get a computer and i've had it for like ten years or not yet but i've had a computer for ten years 

197.96 199.27 B: and 

199.28 203.39 B: i i i do you know my banking on them uh 

203.72 209.83 B: r- reading research i read newspapers from overseas i i can speak four or five languages so 

210.00 213.26 B: i kind of keep up with those that way 

210.49 211.30 A: wow 

213.45 217.04 B: and um my one granddaughter is studying german 

217.48 219.31 B: and she has uh 

219.54 220.90 B: a computer 

221.03 222.60 B: aided um 

223.58 231.75 B: uh software for german and it's helped her she's gotten she was getting kind of bad grades she was getting c. minuses and cs 

232.11 236.25 B: and i bought her that for her birthday and she's been getting as since then 

235.74 241.35 A: oh right and i do think in languages it probably would be a lot more helpful than 

241.75 247.23 A: some other things just [mn] because you can hear how things should be pro- you know it's 

246.69 260.10 B: exactly you can hear the pronunciation and you ca- she can slow it down and there is a program or it isn't a program but there's a method in there where she can compare her speech to the 

247.52 248.77 A: pronounced 

260.15 264.68 B: computer or the professor whatever you want to call them speech pattern 

264.57 265.65 A: (( oh )) 

265.33 272.72 B: to make sure that the words are exact uh not just depending on your voice i mean on your 

269.11 271.06 A: [noise] that would be good [noise] 

272.81 274.14 B: (( ears )) 

273.85 274.67 A: (( ahah )) 

274.34 277.81 B: because you know german has some sounds that we don't have 

277.26 278.52 A: right 

278.11 286.06 B: and you can usually spot an american by his inability or her inability [laughter] to make that make that uh sound 

282.87 283.69 A: mhm 

285.92 296.68 A: that's interesting because i haven't had much language you know oth- other than english training i've learned little bits of different things but i was always kind of paranoid 

291.60 292.37 B: mhm 

297.43 301.82 A: like you said in my head they sounded one way and i couldn't tell if 

302.35 307.23 A: if it was you know the way it came out or not you know if it sounded right 

305.50 308.77 B: right if you were pronouncing it the proper way 

308.36 309.29 A: but 

309.44 313.08 A: that would be kind of cool to have software that could help you 

311.46 314.28 B: oh yeah it shows uh you know uh 

314.45 316.54 B: i guess a sonic pattern 

317.07 318.45 B: in waves 

318.91 322.49 B: and for emphasis and also 

319.21 319.92 A: mm 

322.67 333.75 B: you know the sound quality and the sound itself the tone of not the tone but the the shape of the sound so to speak so with practice you can you can 

330.42 331.66 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

333.94 335.56 B: just 

335.62 338.33 B: uh you know make it exact 

338.75 344.04 B: so you can duplicate these hard sounds that are unfamiliar to the american ear 

344.35 349.58 A: mm i'm going have to tell make sure my sister knows about this she is home schooling 

349.65 358.89 A: and i heard her talking the other day to her son about uh starting to teach him you know another language and i know her husband knows spanish pretty well 

359.11 362.86 A: um and i they've taught him that kind of growing up some but 

362.95 364.01 A: um 

364.30 369.06 A: you know i will have to make sure she checks into software she probably is already planning to 

368.77 370.90 B: (( [cough] yeah there there are )) 

369.38 370.56 A: for that [noise] 

371.42 374.37 B: you can on the internet you can get 

374.41 376.58 B: (( you uh comparative )) 

378.19 381.02 B: values of the different ones um 

381.44 386.58 B: some i've i'm fairly familiar with them because i use them for myself 

386.38 387.40 A: mhm 

386.62 388.70 B: and some of them are just worthless 

388.86 391.60 B: i mean really worthless uh 

392.02 397.30 A: [laughter] that would be bad if you get the wrong kind [laughter] and learned it the wrong way 

394.19 396.40 B: yeah you know but 

396.93 398.50 B: uh berlitz 

399.20 407.77 B: is famous and i think that's one of the worst quality uh language on the internet i mean on with a computer 

407.37 408.19 A: (( ahah )) 

407.93 411.53 B: it's just archaic and old um 

413.07 417.77 B: th- they're all you know she'd have to do just do a little homework and uh 

418.48 420.07 B: they are not expensive 

420.87 422.99 B: i think that i paid 

423.01 425.49 B: fifty or seventy dollars for the one 

425.99 430.70 B: for my granddaughter and it goes uh grandson and it goes um 

432.02 433.39 B: you know through 

433.76 436.87 B: what would be two college years 

436.89 442.09 A: oh well that's definitely worth it if it's helped her improve her 

442.11 448.08 B: oh yeah she's got she wants to go to a good college and she knows that she's got to get 

442.28 443.67 A: grades that well 

448.17 457.06 B: better than average grades you know get near straight as and so she got that c. in uh german and it really threw her so 

450.21 451.66 A: mhm 

458.07 460.31 B: we got this help and 

460.37 462.50 B: she's pulled it out 

462.84 465.03 B: and you know geography i think 

465.66 474.27 B: uh i don't know how old you are but i think that the younger generation has a great void in terms of geography 

474.64 476.76 B: outside of the united states 

477.48 481.29 B: you know that i saw a study done a year ago where they 

481.65 484.37 B: couldn't name the fifty united states 

483.78 488.15 A: oh yeah i've seen some of those things in the paper and it's amazing 

486.66 493.07 B: thirteen per cent of the people knew where iraq was the students only thirteen knew where iraq was 

493.58 501.92 B: uh they gave them the european countries i mean europe without identification just the outline of the country 

502.00 504.60 B: and very few could fill it in 

506.40 514.48 B: you know they just they knew england and they knew france and italy you know that was about it so [mn] i i've very 

514.53 523.23 B: if you had asked me ten years ago i would have said a computer would you know kind of a waste of time but boy now having had some experience with it as you have 

523.48 525.75 B: i think they are wonderful learning tool ahah 

525.43 527.36 A: as i say the more i 

527.76 533.08 A: learn and i actually even though as a programmer you know i've been a main frame programmer and 

532.94 543.50 A: i kind of some of the stuff i thought you don't need some of the you know it's like what you said about you know you don't want to keep yourself or the kids from getting outside and doing things too 

543.13 546.28 B: yes you don't want to replace physical education 

543.59 544.65 A: and 

545.00 549.13 A: but the more i use it for different types you know 

549.32 552.60 A: different types of things you know i'm able to 

552.68 558.98 A: learn from it and you know whether you know it is not necessarily for you know in a school atmosphere but 

559.45 562.55 A: um like you're saying for research and things like that 

561.60 570.42 B: yeah it doesn't have to be formal education it can just be you know if you have an interest or a hobby or or vocation 

570.58 571.82 A: mhm 

570.81 577.29 B: you can use it for educational purposes outside of the structure of a classroom 

578.16 585.05 B: and i do but of course my dear grandchildren use it as an adjunct to do their homework 

585.27 588.64 B: and uh it's helped them so i'm 

589.28 593.52 B: all for it [laughter] as long as you can not let them waste time 

591.45 599.08 A: yeah but as l- as long as they still have to learn how to multiply and things [laughter] because some uh 

596.32 599.89 B: [laughter] well you know i don't
