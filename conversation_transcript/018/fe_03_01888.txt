161.32 162.10 B: mhm 

161.71 171.23 A: and we stay in touch my kid sister sometimes i hear from her a lot other times i don't she's going to graduate school so she's really busy and she works full-time 

168.90 170.49 B: (( right okay yeah )) 

170.73 171.54 B: okay 

171.29 181.75 A: you know so i'm i'm like understanding why i'm not hearing from her you know and my other sister is very busy with her work and she's just not very email oriented you know 

174.40 175.86 B: right yeah 

180.52 181.72 B: right yeah 

181.89 186.52 B: now are your parents closer to the to your other brothers and sisters 

184.87 195.58 A: oh yeah both my sisters live in the same town as my parents and my brother lives like only fifty miles away where i live is about a hundred and fifty miles away 

187.89 189.47 B: mhm 

194.54 196.22 B: right yeah yeah 

195.53 205.06 A: so it's like it's just far enough especially driving alone it takes about three and a half hours you don't go just for one or two nights you know 

201.09 202.33 B: oh yeah 

202.91 205.71 B: no no that's a long trip yeah 

205.45 210.40 A: so you just kind of break you know so in a way you know 

210.89 225.79 A: in a way i'd like to have a closer family and then in another way i'm i'm a really independent person so it's not it's not a problem i mean i'm used to taking care of myself you know there are times when maybe you'd like to talk something over with somebody 

212.90 214.05 B: oh sure 

216.02 218.12 B: yeah it's what you're used to right 

221.27 222.07 B: yeah 

224.51 226.20 B: mhm right 

225.88 228.01 A: you know and you can do that 

227.31 228.36 B: yes 

228.40 232.82 A: you know like you're even something simple you're thinking of buying a washing machine 

232.34 233.72 B: mhm 

233.07 235.88 A: you know maybe you'd like to get a little advice 

235.49 236.68 B: right 

236.07 246.19 A: and um families are good for that kind of stuff and you know and my my father's funny because if i ask him for advice oh he's very flattered you know 

239.32 240.65 B: oh yeah 

245.34 246.93 B: [laughter] 

246.23 252.33 A: oh yeah you know but um yeah they're they're funny about that and you know i 

247.06 248.49 B: yeah 

252.37 258.11 A: i'm sorry i haven't gotten married i'd like to get married but you know you don't get married just to get married 

254.97 256.19 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

257.49 269.26 B: no no that's that's funny that you said that my um my brother he has a serious girlfriend now that you know all growing up all through high school and everything we never met any of his girlfriends and now this one 

268.80 272.02 A: oh so finally he introduces you oh 

270.04 271.37 B: (( [laughter] )) 

271.52 277.68 B: finally there's one there that you know that he wants us to meet and so tonight we're going out to dinner with her 

277.15 279.01 A: the first time 

277.86 281.49 B: well my parents have met her but this is the first time i'm meeting her 

281.02 283.22 A: uh-huh she's probably a nervous wreck 

282.63 291.95 B: she probably is i'm really nervous too but it's funny because even without meeting her i'm very d- you know very defensive [laughter] and very protective of him 

290.76 293.30 A: you're protective of your brother yeah 

291.96 294.63 B: yeah and so and we um 

294.40 303.77 A: yeah but but you know just the fact that she means enough to him that he wants you to meet her i mean this this is like a big deal for him obviously 

299.82 300.91 B: that's right 

303.22 309.23 B: it's funny though 'cause when i was dating my husband i didn't realize it from their point of view how hard it must have been on him 

309.04 321.32 B: you know seeing his sister moving to new york with somebody and everything and now even my mom's like she's like now we're on the other side and i could be like the mother-in-law [laughter] you know so it's different but 

310.67 311.65 A: (( oh )) 

318.00 319.06 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

320.77 324.88 A: it is it's it is it's very interesting is your brother younger or older 

324.35 325.56 B: yeah he's younger 

325.21 328.32 A: younger yeah see i'm the oldest in my family also you 

328.37 329.60 B: yeah so 

329.11 338.07 A: know and it's it's weird because sometimes people ask me for advice because i'm the oldest what's weird is when your parents ask you for advice does that ever happen to you 

332.98 333.85 B: mhm 

338.09 341.77 B: not too often they're pretty they're pretty self-sufficient 

339.28 340.42 A: oh okay 

341.17 347.04 A: i mean i'm not i'm not saying it's happened very much but but occasionally occasionally 

343.37 344.39 B: yeah 

345.61 348.82 B: probably my mom more so than you know my dad 

348.36 349.80 A: mhm 

348.99 349.89 B: (( you know )) 

349.90 354.40 B: or you know i'm close with my dad but not nearly you know like with my mom 

353.86 360.44 A: yeah well and guys are like just i think in general more hesitant to ask for advice from anybody 

357.71 358.73 B: yeah 

359.79 361.07 B: probably 

360.56 366.78 A: you know i mean you know the the whole thing about how a guy will drive around for miles and never ask for directions 

364.26 367.13 B: [laughter] that's very true 

366.89 368.07 A: yeah 

368.08 370.59 A: weird but weird but true 

369.25 371.73 B: yeah that's what that's what they do 

371.39 372.54 A: yeah 

372.13 373.96 B: yeah so [mn] 

373.51 387.79 A: so but no i'm you know and it you know to me i think the most important thing is would you be friends with the people in your family even if you weren't related i think that's like you know the really big question and 

383.91 385.62 B: that's right yeah that's it 

386.22 387.31 B: mhm 

387.64 393.43 A: definitely for my with my brother absolutely i would say yes you know now 

392.64 393.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

394.22 395.64 A: um 

396.81 399.51 A: i have some cousins that i no 

399.31 402.82 B: mhm yeah me too [laughter] definitely yeah 

399.72 403.60 A: you know i mean it's like you know we don't i mean i 

403.63 417.17 A: but my one cousin visits in florida every year and so she always makes this big deal of seeing me and seeing my brother and you know see and it and yet we're not really connecting 

406.93 408.07 B: mhm 

410.98 411.87 B: yeah 

416.70 417.54 B: no 

417.17 424.06 A: you know we have this conversation i'm going why did this woman want to see me you know i don't know her i don't know anything about her i don't care 

423.91 433.40 A: but she doesn't have any brothers or sisters she doesn't have her parents are gone she doesn't have any close relatives so i guess it means something to her it's like 

426.75 427.86 B: (( oh okay )) 

428.92 429.85 B: mhm 

432.77 434.12 B: just yeah 

433.62 435.89 A: okay you know i mean

437.25 444.08 B: right yeah i have a lot i actually have one cousin who i mean growing up we were we were like sisters we you know 

443.95 458.85 B: spent the night at each other's house we were constantly together and then through high school and that we just we grew up you know and just went we were in different schools and that so we went you know different ways and then just recently we um an uncle passed away and so we saw each other at the funeral you know 

445.29 446.32 A: yeah 

450.22 452.56 A: you drifted away from each other

458.87 471.12 B: and exchanged email and wrote you know once or twice [laughter] and then there's i have nothing to say to her you know i like her and everything but there's just there's nothing there any more 

462.96 466.46 A: and then that was it oh isn't that funny
