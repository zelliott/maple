76.42 87.30 B: i can't imagine life without my children my husband you know i actually have some friends that tell me that they have no intention of having children and so on and it kind of baffles me a little bit 

87.30 88.20 A: (( yeah )) 

87.31 89.08 B: so i'm like wow you know 

89.12 91.96 A: yeah same here i don't understand i don't

90.29 91.14 B: i nev- 

92.01 93.18 B: (( i known like peop- )) 

92.16 95.09 A: know why anyone wouldn't want to start a family 

94.21 105.00 B: exactly like i say you know everybody has a career you know i work actually this year i've decided to take the rest of the year off until the baby's about a year which i did not do with my other daughter um just to 

104.96 110.02 B: kind of just to enjoy every moment with my baby you know seeing him grow this time 

109.81 123.58 B: um with my daughter i actually had gone to school and went into a new job and so i missed i felt like i missed a lot although i know in society today you know not everyone's so fortunate where they can stay home but uh 

122.61 123.60 A: right 

123.84 125.80 B: you know it's been real nice 

124.12 125.10 A: yeah i 

125.93 130.23 A: i stopped working um [lipsmack] working when my daughter was born 

130.34 135.43 A: and then i went back for a year when she was old enough to go to preschool 

134.91 135.93 B: okay 

135.57 147.82 A: and then when she started kindergarten i i stopped working again it just got you know there was it was hard to find someone to watch her after and i didn't want to bring her to like a house day care so 

146.40 150.68 B: right right now are you currently still at home 

150.29 151.85 A: i'm at home now yes 

151.15 164.41 B: oh that's nice i hope that i'll be able to do this for at least a year and i haven't decided um i'm a nurse so i'm kind of lucky i have the ability to kind of i guess do off shifts and things if i need to because it is more 

164.33 174.10 B: family in general is more important to me at this point than my career you know i i don't feel like i have to be there every day although i i think i'd kind of like to go back a little bit 

173.70 176.83 A: yeah i i sometimes i'd like to go back but 

177.03 180.03 A: i'm lucky enough right now i don't have to 

179.66 180.81 B: right 

180.17 181.79 A: and it's mostly 

182.31 186.26 A: just getting out you know and talking to other people [laughter] 

185.27 199.61 B: exactly and that's what you know my husband and i say the same thing we're kind of in the situation now where i don't feel like i absolutely have to be working um which is great you know and i have made like some changes in my lifestyle i'd say you know of course you're a little more 

199.49 207.34 B: you know flimsy when what you spend and things like that when you are working and as opposed to not but i feel the same way i mean you know i 

203.17 204.23 A: right 

207.14 217.14 B: i feel like i should be raising my children and and it's also been good for my eleven year old 'cause she's just getting at that age where you know she can get into sports and things like that um 

216.12 216.93 A: right 

217.14 230.16 B: so it's kind of nice to be home and and be there for her as well although i don't think she'd mind as much if i was back at work because i'm not because i was working a day job anyway where most of the time i was at work i was you know she was in school 

220.80 221.54 A: yeah 

223.79 224.68 A: (( [laughter] )) 

229.91 230.76 A: right 

230.30 231.76 B: so um

256.39 257.33 B: okay 

257.02 259.75 A: and that's where i'm from and then we moved out here 

259.45 260.48 B: okay 

260.51 263.57 B: do you get to spend much time with the rest of your family 

263.48 266.79 A: um actually we just got back from spending a week up there 

266.34 268.23 B: great that's nice 

267.11 272.60 A: so yeah about three four times a year they either come down here or we go up there 

272.93 275.95 B: very nice is it a long drive for you guys 

273.58 274.38 A: (( so )) 

275.37 277.17 A: no it's about three hours 

276.82 277.83 B: okay 

277.18 279.77 A: well it depends three to 

280.07 283.59 A: three to four or five depending on traffic and all that 

283.05 284.05 B: okay 

284.24 285.32 A: (( so it's )) 

285.60 289.65 A: it's nice we definitely make time especially for the holidays 

289.68 290.83 B: right 

290.13 291.20 A: we always 

292.03 293.73 A: um make a point of 

293.80 297.51 A: either going up there or or everyone trucking down here 

297.11 311.98 B: yeah and it's really nice to have that i know my my mother's side of the family is very large um both my husband and i we each um have one sibling and our siblings are actually the same age and i have a sister and he has a brother but other than that his family's pretty tiny 

311.78 318.06 B: um the family that he does have um are located in the area but they're not very close to one another 

317.81 318.62 A: (( mm )) 

318.03 324.31 B: and my mom's family on the other side um my father's family's fairly small but my mom's family is like huge 

323.82 325.36 A: yeah my mom's too 

324.21 336.17 B: and there's there's so many of us that we have to wear like name tags when we go to things 'cause you know everybody's always bringing their new stuff or whoever along and it's like oh my god i'll never remember all these names but um 

327.68 328.28 A: (( [laughter] )) 

335.18 336.09 A: (( [laughter] )) 

335.93 349.47 B: you know it's i feel fortunate that i have that whenever a holiday comes and so on and and my husband's really been able to benefit from it um and you know we bring his parents and his brother and stuff along for like christmas and thanksgiving and stuff now 

342.86 343.94 A: yeah 

349.26 361.88 B: just because they they've got to really enjoy it because they never knew that you know they always had such a small you know kind of ah not so large gathering when it came to holidays and things with the family and stuff 

353.23 354.17 A: yeah 

360.29 364.43 A: right same here my husband they he didn't have that 

364.52 369.33 A: and now he says he knows what family you know what it's about 

368.91 369.96 B: right 

369.82 373.66 A: you know where the way it should be that's what he says 

373.21 383.34 B: right exactly that's what my husband always says he feels like you know he's like wow you've had this your whole life and he's like it's kind of like an eye opener for me 'cause we're so used to just doing our thing 

382.74 383.96 A: mhm 

383.17 390.06 B: and he's like i didn't realize that it could be so neat you know i'm the oldest of all of our the children and cousins um 

389.94 391.82 B: on my mom's side so 

391.65 401.16 B: it it seems like i'm pretty close to everybody because i've known them all you know all along and the ones that are close to age to my own age like we've been very close where you know we're still friendly and 

401.00 412.70 B: when it came time for our weddings and things everyone went to one another's wedding and you know we call one another all the time and so now he's also become close with them and their spouses and he's like it's really neat you know 

412.21 413.43 A: yeah 

412.79 416.04 B: and we kind of said the same i mean i think as far as 

415.80 429.49 B: as our own um ideas as of now since my daughter and son are so far apart in age our home isn't huge um to the point where we do not have an extra bedroom right now so i don't haven't decided if we're gonna have another child or not 

429.31 438.91 B: at this point um because we'd probably have to do a lot of arranging in the house to get my daughter into like you know maybe refinish another room in the house it's her room [sigh] and 

439.14 446.87 B: so but um i think i'd even like to have one more i can't imagine my life without another baby now that i have him so 

446.11 447.61 A: yeah i am 

447.74 453.02 A: we were talking about us having another but everyone says hey don't wait too long but 

453.35 454.26 A: i mean 

454.57 458.43 A: what did you guys plan to have your second child or 

458.05 462.61 B: yes i'm actually um i'm actually thirty and ah 

462.52 473.02 B: i had my daughter when i was eighteen and she's actually my husband is not her father but she still has a relationship with her dad as well um but she's known my husband i guess since she was about four 

472.80 478.29 B: so we had talked all along in the beginning um we've been married three years and we had like a whole game plan 

478.07 488.76 B: as far as you know we had gone out for so many years before we got married it was like you know when we got married we wanted to get the house and we kind of had a game plan we knew we wanted a year or two to get ourselves settled in 

488.21 489.18 A: mhm 

488.59 501.69 B: and have our son um you know it was like okay that'll be the perfect timing for the baby and it actually worked out like to a t. you know we decided to start planning when we did and we're very lucky to to get pregnant fairly quickly 

501.49 515.79 B: um and ah you know so he was definitely planned um and things have worked great and our big dilemma now is like you know would we want to have another one in the next year or two um you know i don't know that i'd want to have any 

515.79 518.06 B: any sooner than than that 

517.64 518.54 A: mhm 

517.85 523.04 B: however with my daughter and her age like if we had a girl we're gonna run into that issue of 

522.81 526.18 B: you know we can't put a baby in a room with her [laughter] obviously 

524.76 526.25 A: right right 

525.98 540.16 B: and we're not gonna put the a girl i mean we could with him for a period of time but then it would be a whole issue would we want to move into a larger home or would we want to do some renovations with the home we're currently in which we've only been in for three years we bought it when right when we had gotten married 

529.04 530.47 A: right 

540.10 553.44 B: so uh it's a little dilemma right now [laughter] but um you know and i and that's what people say to me well you know you're thirty and i'm like well that's young you know i don't know i wouldn't mind waiting a little longer maybe five years six years you know 

550.61 551.80 A: (( [laughter] oh yeah )) 

553.30 566.75 B: um it doesn't scare me age to me you know having children a little bit older even up to my forties would not scare me at all um i think i'd like to have them a little bit younger just 'cause i feel like i could probably enjoy them more 

556.40 557.59 A: yeah 

566.76 571.18 B: you know and have more energy now than i would when i'm like fifty [laughter] so 

570.14 571.18 A: yeah 

571.20 572.11 B: um 

571.34 579.06 A: yeah that's like what our thing is we only have a two bedroom and you know if we have another child that um 

579.85 581.66 A: you know what if it's a boy 

581.49 582.70 B: right 

581.83 584.67 A: my daughter's [laughter] 

583.22 597.27 B: right and that's what you know what we were saying like it can work out for a period of time and then that just becomes difficult i mean you know my husband's like well people make do and i'm like that's just our biggest thing it's just such an age gap that it's like whoa [laughter] you know 

588.23 589.30 A: right 

596.31 597.55 A: yeah 

597.43 599.95 B: but um thank god for my older
