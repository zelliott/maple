0.44 2.82 A: hello this is david 

1.20 2.40 B: hello 

2.56 4.48 B: hi david this is laura 

4.19 5.71 A: hi laura 

6.02 9.02 A: what part of the country are you coming from 

7.74 9.96 B: i'm um i'm in philadelphia 

9.46 10.75 A: philadelphia 

10.95 12.57 A: uh i'm in rawley 

12.23 13.32 B: you're in rawley 

14.00 15.47 A: almost due south of you 

14.26 15.05 B: (( wow )) 

15.38 17.07 B: mhm mhm 

18.56 20.01 B: (( yes so com- )) 

19.36 21.27 A: our topic is 

20.26 25.55 B: computers and how they and education how they help or hinder 

21.97 23.23 A: education 

25.15 26.88 A: mm or do they help and hinder 

25.97 28.69 B: are good things are bad things 

28.95 32.23 A: yes that's correct that's what i understand 

29.29 30.20 B: mhm 

30.77 31.84 B: yes 

32.00 33.06 B: well 

33.07 33.90 B: (( hm )) 

33.88 35.34 A: i think they do both 

35.39 38.66 B: i i would be inclined to agree um 

38.60 43.65 A: like most things [laughter] you can abuse it it can be 

39.52 41.07 B: [laughter] 

43.86 45.64 A: implemented 

44.91 47.11 B: mhm i i 

46.36 46.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

47.49 50.98 B: taught for a while and was interested in um 

51.13 56.19 B: in how how it worked with students just you know um in terms of of 

56.45 57.23 B: um 

57.23 71.69 B: get com- get computers with kids with some kids and it you know engages them and suddenly you know it's it's not passive and they are all involved but then it's it can be a huge distraction it can be the only thing they learn [laughter] nothing else at all [laughter] 

62.23 63.14 A: yes 

70.50 80.62 A: [noise] that's true that's true um and it's also it can be very good for um additional assignments or for self paced studies 

71.95 73.10 B: mhm 

80.62 82.56 B: for pa- self pacing 

82.16 83.62 A: for self pacing 

83.23 84.02 B: (( mm )) 

83.67 94.35 A: whereas certain individ- certain students may have additional drills that need be done that the rest of the class doesn't need to have so they it it can be done so 

90.37 92.35 B: mhm yeah 

94.75 98.26 A: you know you can help enhance the concepts going on [noise] 

97.72 102.29 B: mhm i guess it it allows for a kind of infinite individualization 

102.43 103.97 B: as long as the computer 

104.10 112.50 B: knows what's going on with you and can kind of diagnose what you need i recall taking the the g._r._e.s on the computer 

112.39 125.77 B: um they switched all the formats over to computers a couple of years ago and and now the whole test kind of formats your version of it you know depending on how many you have gotten right so far so no-one gets the same test 

124.54 127.43 A: (( mhm )) 

126.02 128.09 B: it's very much that story 

127.72 130.31 A: well when i took it it was all paper and pencil 

129.98 133.65 B: yes [laughter] i wish i had taken it then [laughter] 

133.30 137.52 A: i have taken some other tests since then they were on liners 

137.58 146.72 A: it's it's nothing like taking taking something on line and realizing that you're getting get instant rep- feedback as to what your score is 

146.22 147.48 B: uh yeah i 

147.70 149.56 B: i think especially with 

149.86 154.04 B: with literature which is what i taught you just can't 

152.03 152.73 A: (( mm )) 

153.93 165.49 B: replace the you know kind of engagement of a person with a page and the ability to i mean especially to write notes and annotate and engage with the text in that way which um 

165.74 168.68 A: well that especially within education uh 

168.74 176.23 A: [mn] there's something different about having to put a thought proc- having to think about your thought process and be able to 

176.26 184.15 A: expand that into the written word that's more difficult to do on the [noise] com- on on the com- on the computer other than a word processor of course 

178.60 179.51 B: mhm 

182.21 183.11 B: (( yeah yes )) 

183.82 191.64 B: i actually now that i'm thinking of it i wonder if computers actually because you can only respond to them in a ways they in a way 

191.81 195.44 B: um cue you to respond to them and i wonder if it actually limits 

193.39 194.73 A: [noise] 

195.74 197.75 B: um what you can learn 

197.85 205.03 B: um you know in in ways that are more natural i don't know i guess natural is like the opposite of computer but [laughter] 

204.24 212.63 A: well once again it's how you have it programmed also because you can set up things like almost like the the artificial intelligence aspect 

207.40 208.34 B: mhm 

212.62 223.99 A: so that as you get more and more into it it can [mn] learn as you're doing and also feed give you as you select different kinds of alternatives [noise] 

224.63 228.19 B: this is like almost like choose your own adventure sort of like 

225.09 226.80 A: go different paths that way 

226.82 231.72 A: but some of that has to be programmed in to begin with um 

229.71 230.90 B: yeah 

231.75 235.61 A: and also but it has has to be approached that way also 

235.98 241.86 A: the other thing too is that especially in the in the educational matters i have done some some teaching 

241.99 242.98 B: mhm 

242.24 253.42 A: but a computer doesn't necessarily know when you see a ch- see a child finally finally it hits hits them like a ton of bricks and they're starting to catch the concept 

251.53 252.50 B: yeah 

253.26 254.37 B: yeah 

254.47 264.80 B: and i guess you you never have kids that that come home and remember they always remember that computer they they had in second grade [laughter] and not you know 

262.92 264.85 A: (( yeah )) 

264.90 265.79 B: the 

265.14 269.09 A: and but once they get to middle school they never remember anything happening in school 

268.36 277.40 B: [laughter] you sound like you have kids [laughter] huh it it must be do do you 

272.35 273.34 A: (( yes [noise] )) 

277.45 282.35 B: do your kids have a lot of computer involvement in the classroom or did they in their education 

282.31 286.92 A: [sigh] um i don't know how much they had there we had all had computers at home too 

286.74 287.60 B: (( aha mhm )) 

287.39 299.96 A: but i think that for the most part they did have computer at least several computers in their classroom which they would take time [mn] time during the day in a lot of s- in the school system down here they tend to have centers 

300.04 300.88 B: (( ahah )) 

300.49 309.15 A: so at different parts of the day the children will be going using different assignments in a different part of the classroom to split s- s- s- split it out 

308.41 311.06 B: so it so they're all kind of doing different 

310.45 312.81 A: yes that's correct 

311.39 314.66 B: things did did you feel pretty good about um 

314.69 319.91 B: like the time taken for computer stuff with your kids did you feel like it was a good use of 

320.00 322.15 B: of like class time 

322.49 324.40 B: or did it did it ever feel 

325.20 326.35 A: mm 

325.82 328.81 B: you know like they were kind of having endless computer whatever 

328.06 330.27 A: no i don't i don't prop- 

329.04 330.67 B: i've always heard that 

330.38 332.99 A: (( like do they have endless computer )) 

332.62 343.38 B: or just kind of having too much unstructured computer time or that learning you know quote computer was taking away from learning other things sounds like you never felt like that 

341.71 342.45 A: (( they )) 

343.09 357.48 A: well i hadn't really i hadn't really thought about that some of that i think is just most of the time it's been more supplemental just getting used to the doing something and to be able do it and some of the things they do too is that they may have accelerated reader 

350.11 351.07 B: mhm 

357.37 359.73 A: tests that are on it for 

357.52 358.32 B: (( ahah )) 

360.11 369.18 A: supplemental aspects of of the schooling so is that really computer time yeah it is on the computer but it's you're taking a test 

363.84 365.09 B: mhm 

368.55 371.35 B: yeah it sounds like it's a lot um 

371.42 379.44 B: kind of based on how it's structured and i yeah i've i've been teaching in in the philadelphia schools and you definitely have you know 

373.14 373.99 A: yes 

379.29 387.04 B: whole classrooms that just have you know tonnes of you know quote computer time when i don't know what the kids are doing i think they are just kind of 

384.17 384.91 A: (( mm )) 

386.54 394.10 A: oh yeah i- i- it should be a it should yeah and it should be a part an integrated part as to what the curriculum is actually doing 

388.27 390.43 B: it's so much how you use it [laughter] 

393.99 401.90 A: some aspects it's easier to use that for i have a scientific background and that tends [noise] to lend itself a lot easier to it than 

398.31 399.36 B: yeah 

402.20 410.25 A: pure literature there's there obviously certain certain formats or certain components of literature can lend itself very well to it 

403.40 404.40 B: yeah 

408.00 408.81 B: yeah 

409.63 410.76 B: yeah 

410.24 417.84 A: but obviously in like help identification of different writing styles but not necessarily the actual writing itself 

417.80 419.96 B: mhm yeah i think especially in 

420.05 421.00 B: um 

421.45 425.02 B: i hear teachers complain especially in the early grades 

425.17 433.57 B: you know that it's kind of all about how you use it that they feel like they are being required to [mn] make sure kids get computer time and and 

433.35 441.63 B: because it's really important i mean everything you end up doing has some connection to it and like you were saying before like you'd have to be comfortable with the 

438.35 439.94 A: yeah 

441.29 442.84 A: yeah yeah you have your 

441.91 448.97 B: basic feel and like not being afraid it's going to blow up which i certainly remember you know when i first started 

444.57 445.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

445.85 447.37 A: yeah 

447.80 448.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

449.56 454.56 B: i was older and i thought they were going to blow up all the time [laughter] you hit the wrong key 

454.38 463.96 A: mhm well i have ve- i have had computers crashes have had them crash before on me but it's not because of what i did but because of the software itself 

460.13 461.14 B: yeah 

463.27 469.29 B: yeah it sounds like you also know you you know a bit about computers it sounds like your background 

468.27 470.41 A: i've i've used them for years 

469.81 474.55 B: sounds like you you know some things about programming and networks and all of that 

473.65 482.45 A: yes i've done some i've done some of that i try not to do that too extensively i've been more of a user rather than a tech a techy although i was a techy 

475.63 476.82 B: yeah 

478.34 479.04 B: (( yeah )) 

480.61 481.54 B: yeah 

483.00 484.14 A: before 

484.17 496.99 A: before they really came around but that's that's that's a different story but not but like it's as you were talking before talking before most things there's 

486.40 487.23 B: huh 

489.13 490.74 B: right yep 

497.74 500.09 A: nothing is ever a panacea [mn] 

499.54 500.38 B: yeah 

500.13 502.17 A: (( any kind of advances that come )) 

503.63 511.74 A: there's good parts of it and there's mis- and there's bad parts of it or misuses of it and seen some things that if you if you don't use it properly 

507.52 510.87 B: (( mhm yeah i was going to say misuse of key )) 

511.89 515.81 A: you're not going to get the benefit that you you would want it to be regardless of what it is 

513.58 514.48 B: yeah 

515.36 520.23 B: yeah or just poorly structured use or whatever absolutely 

518.04 521.61 A: yeah that's well that's that's all or that's all been misuse 

520.87 522.52 B: yeah absolutely 

522.23 525.05 A: you're not using your resources appropriately 

524.13 525.26 B: yeah 

525.29 526.23 B: yeah 

525.89 528.34 A: or like you know they're just sitting doing nothing 

528.59 532.13 B: yeah which is really it's it's too bad if it isn't 

532.21 533.72 B: it's not helping anyone 

533.70 537.04 A: that's true that's true so you're you're no longer teaching 

537.28 541.09 B: no i i i write full time now for actu- 

539.83 541.88 A: okay what what are you what are you writing 

541.69 546.14 B: well i write actually i write for an educational institution i i write for penn 

546.02 546.77 A: mhm 

546.21 548.34 B: um the university of pennsylvania 

548.34 549.16 A: yes 

548.45 551.56 B: just various external affairs sorts of things 

551.58 552.40 A: mhm 

552.08 552.84 B: so 

553.14 555.77 B: so i do use a computer all day but it's for 

553.29 553.93 A: (( mm )) 

555.69 557.26 A: (( [laughter] )) 

556.69 561.77 B: somewhat administrationary less than educational [laughter] uses 

558.26 559.27 A: yes 

560.37 561.86 A: right 

562.72 574.22 A: well i do some i do a a some con- consulting work and i do it just for communication purposes and sending um doc- planning documents and so forth and [mn] it's 

568.12 569.06 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

574.27 580.07 A: a great well like spreadsheets [mn] you you can't do that you can't do that stuff paper and pencil 

579.78 581.61 B: right right 

580.71 583.56 A: it would just it would just take far far too long 

583.51 586.62 B: yeah you're definitely in the area where 

586.75 599.89 B: the the computer is [laughter] constantly saving your life i'm sure in all sorts of ways [laughter] where yeah i i do feel um i i do feel very balanced about it it's it's not you know 

591.14 593.73 A: [laughter]
