0.00 1.54 A: hi i'm donna 

0.85 2.90 B: wendy how nice to meet you 

2.50 5.33 A: nice to meet you too i'm up in saint paul minnesota 

4.77 6.28 B: oh new york 

5.78 8.59 A: oh great great how's the weather out there 

8.06 9.96 B: (( it's a little cold today [laughter] )) 

9.33 13.93 A: oh you've got some nice warm warmth coming it is about seventy today 

11.83 13.18 B: i hope so 

13.43 15.03 B: (( ah great )) 

14.82 20.26 A: so we're supposed to discuss education and whether computers hurt it or help it 

19.62 20.83 B: yes 

20.29 23.46 A: well i don't know about you but i think they help it 

22.81 34.66 B: [mn] i ag- i agree i actually see both sides of the story i would say they definitely help it because with the internet and everything computers in the classroom you know kids have access to so much education 

29.46 30.56 A: exactly 

34.22 44.80 A: exactly see but you can adults my husband took um online classes from the university of phoenix i guess that would qualify under what we're talking about 

41.12 42.42 B: oh wow 

44.27 45.63 B: definitely [mn] 

44.92 56.18 A: and that was very paper heavy very very computer heavy um lots of um interaction like on um chat programs and and lots of looking up things 

55.32 61.64 B: [mn] right and and it gives people who are maybe in a remote location access to greater education [noise] 

60.68 74.04 A: oh absolutely and as far as kids go they're great i think as long as the school puts um filters and blocks on certain things well my my husband has as daughter whose twelve twelve and a half 

69.15 70.66 B: oh yeah 

74.07 82.91 A: and um she lives in a very remote location in central minnesota and i don't even know how many people are in the town maybe twelve hundred maybe not even that many 

82.91 90.75 A: and it's amazing the things that these children list um themselves as and they're doing a lot of it or they were doing it from school 

90.89 96.72 A: um you know um like a._o._l. prog- i don't mean a._o._l. like yahoo profiles and all that 

96.10 97.35 B: mhm 

96.70 109.43 A: but they put blocks on that and they also used to list they figured it was a safe you know a safe environment so they used to list the bus schedules on there but they found out well somebody could just look that up and kidnap children 

108.86 110.15 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

109.50 117.27 A: so they took that off but as far as accessing the computer whether it's internet or whether it's just word processing i think it's great 

116.66 130.27 B: oh definitely but on the other hand the access to the internet it makes children since they have it it's easier for them to do their reports and their homework and that they can just you know just download reports right off the internet and not actually do the work [mn] 

124.53 125.41 A: mhm 

129.50 134.82 A: sure they've got even a site i think it's called something like clip notes dot com or something like that 

133.96 135.43 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

134.81 147.79 A: but you know [mn] in elementary level anyway the teachers are pretty damn smart um as you get higher up i'm sure the kids change some of the words and plagiarize that way but um [mn] 

139.51 140.47 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

147.93 160.60 A: i just basically know about you know the elementary end of it and um see that that does a lot of good and it teams them also skills how to problem solve how to trouble shoot and how to type on a basic level 

159.98 169.31 B: oh definitely i mean i mean i'm in upper level education now and i definitely utilize the computer to do all my research and it would have taken me like a thousand 

166.75 167.69 A: oh yeah 

168.86 169.56 A: oh 

169.48 172.16 B: more just to go for the book and everything so it 

171.34 175.00 A: can you imagine having to go to a library and look everything up that we look up 

174.65 178.74 B: it's it's it's crazy you any question you know 

178.80 189.74 B: you know kids are always so inquisitive and wanting to know things and like now they can just get the answer really quickly and that's great and it encourages em to you know want to learn and find out things 

180.94 181.61 A: [laughter] 

185.11 186.34 A: exactly 

189.16 192.95 A: oh exactly and then it's great for opening discussions too 

192.56 193.94 B: oh definitely 

193.00 200.44 A: but but as far as like as i said as far as computers go i'm very very heavily into um putting on filters whether it's at home 

200.56 203.58 A: um or at school or even the library 

203.08 206.35 B: oh absolutely when there's kids around you definitely need that 

205.81 209.78 A: well his his ex wife doesn't understand how to put it on so i 

210.16 221.31 A: i try to explain to her and so did my husband how to even just put a password on password protect it period you know because ah the child has signed up for a dating service she's twelve 

216.10 217.11 B: mhm 

220.67 222.46 B: [laughter] 

222.34 225.05 A: yeah that it wasn't amusing at the time 

224.59 225.68 B: [laughter] 

225.03 238.28 A: and um [laughter] but you know i said just password protect it you don't know how to put filters or restrict sites or even buy a program go to the store buy a program that that restricts all that you have to enter password for it 

237.65 238.92 B: yeah 

238.29 245.74 A: and she's still as far as i know hasn't done that but as far as education oh i don't i think that i wish i would of had of 

245.57 247.44 B: (( oh def- yeah yeah )) 

245.75 249.50 A: had it in high school and i'm i'm forty three how old are you 

248.89 250.27 B: twenty four 

249.70 252.35 A: oh you're young you're my son's age 

250.76 251.51 B: yeah 

252.24 256.56 B: but i mean they were just starting to put computers in the school when i was going through [mn] 

255.88 261.61 A: we had like i think it was about two computers i wen- i graduated it was my master's school was seventy eight 

261.46 264.33 A: and they had like two terminals in the whole school 

264.16 277.98 A: and they were for mainly just entering attendance and it was i mean there wasn't there was no internet or anything like that um it was for like entering attendance doing spreadsheets and all that kind of stuff and we could go in there and we could play games like pong 

273.65 274.71 B: yeah 

277.65 279.10 B: [laughter] 

277.97 281.92 A: you know on our [laughter] days off you're too young to remember pong 

281.32 283.24 B: [laughter] i've heard about it 

282.53 285.57 A: yeah yeah it was like a basic slow 

285.78 288.43 A: tennis i don't know how to explain it it 

287.50 289.54 B: no no i know what it is 

288.97 293.12 A: was so stupid but that is what we could do on you know on the computer 

293.29 298.95 A: um but i also believe that that kids should have access to home computers if at all possible 

298.68 299.97 B: oh yeah 

299.38 307.67 A: um some schools like higher end schools you know something we can't afford actually give the kids laptops to use 

307.06 308.57 B: wow 

307.86 311.26 A: and yeah i think that's great and they should be able to 

311.35 315.08 A: but i do think even in um in lesser 

315.31 323.09 A: lesser how should i say this in poorer places for for lack of let better place or bet- better term that they should have better um 

323.81 330.72 A: fees because i know that we have d._s._l. and it's expensive and a lot of people can't even just a dial up 

327.53 328.42 B: (( [noise] [mn] mhm )) 

330.30 331.43 B: yeah 

330.80 334.44 A: what are they i don't even know what they run now like twenty dollars a month 

334.32 339.58 B: well i have actually i access it through my school i can dial up to my school computer are it is free for me [mn] 

339.04 353.57 A: oh yeah my my niece too she's at um north western and she can um go through her laptop [mn] whether she is at home or whether she's um you know at school or whatever but just regular elementary school kids can't do that 

346.04 346.89 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

352.98 354.00 B: right 

353.58 358.71 A: but if you but if you get them started early enough if you expose them to it they're not going to be afraid of it 

358.53 362.93 B: oh no it's it's the greatest tool of this century of the century [mn] 

362.23 366.26 A: oh yes absolutely [noise] i don't know how we did without it 

366.02 369.28 B: [laughter] i already i can't even remember that far [laughter] [mn] 

368.72 374.72 A: well i tell you my dad was in the army in the fifties and that is how he got into computers um one 

374.50 388.73 A: they had people in line and as they came to the front of the line they said you go to the left you go to the right left right and and the ones like on the right went to korea the ones on the left went to germany and he went to germany and he learnt how to get into computers he's he's been into computers since the fifties 

388.12 389.21 B: mhm 

388.76 395.67 A: so we always sort of grew up around [laughter] technology and none of us are afraid except for my mother she she could learn 

393.94 394.81 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

395.68 397.22 A: you know and she should 

397.34 400.90 A: um but she can't type so [laughter] [noise] 

400.50 406.68 B: yeah it's also great to teach the older generation the computer because that way they can stay in touch with their families and 

405.90 416.14 A: well i was very surprised [noise] mum did when she lived in wisconsin she did take a a course at the senior center it said basic computers now that to me would mean 

416.11 422.57 A: learning how to basically type maybe some chat programs and learning how to at least access the internet 

422.64 435.45 A: they went in there and they taught they were trying to teach them excel at the higher level um [lipsmack] powerpoint and stuff like that and i'm like this is seniors class of absolute beginners 

428.42 428.96 B: (( ah )) 

430.59 431.67 B: wow 

434.98 438.28 B: right and when are they going to use powerpoint presentations [laughter] 

436.93 442.90 A: oh i know what are they going to do hold a presentation right there you know at the senior center this is what i learnt nothing 

442.93 445.25 A: (( you know [laughter] but )) 

443.04 443.74 B: (( [noise] )) 

443.77 444.80 B: yeah 

445.09 454.71 A: [mn] it can be great for the seniors and i know that my my dad still hunts in packs but i would like to talk to him sometimes online in fact he'll hide from me 

454.03 455.29 B: [laughter] 

454.54 462.26 A: he has a._o._l. and i'll see him when he pops up and he won't answer me he'll become like he doesn't see me because he can't really type even though he has been in it all these years 

461.65 462.73 B: mhm 

462.40 463.53 A: um 

463.57 464.64 A: let's see 

464.75 467.70 A: what other vein haven't we covered that they'll wanna hear 

467.37 468.60 B: mhm 

468.22 480.40 A: well like i said my husband did the um university of phoenix online very expensive at least we thought it was but excellent um they downloaded everything for you they had instructors and you had 

480.51 490.70 A: virtual classrooms they the ad part about that is if somebody didn't pull their own weight they just like in i suppose in college for you [laughter] if they didn't pull their own weight you had to do it 

488.52 489.30 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

490.64 491.72 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

490.72 494.67 A: or or the whole team loses but um 

494.23 502.87 B: it also it also helps where where it will be if you look at it from the teacher's perspective i mean it helps them with less in making lessons in more creative ways and 

502.20 506.28 A: oh exactly exactly and the teacher actually there was some 

506.28 512.48 A: real um a couple of really decent teachers i mean really really made you think i i guess it is like in life 

512.29 525.31 A: and others that were just sort of read these chapters and give you know you guys each give me an individual paper on this um tell me how you research it put it in this format and then i also want a group paper done by tuesday 

524.85 525.99 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

525.30 537.91 A: you know and no no real specks on that so you had to get creative um and decide how far you wanted to go on that and most of the time it was really you know the people were pretty good about it um 

537.95 543.82 A: but like i said it was very expensive i think we paid um about fifteen hundred dollars a class 

543.40 544.77 B: (( wow [noise] [mn] )) 

544.16 553.88 A: i my understand- i think the classes were four credits each which you know and they're five weeks long but they're every day i mean you have to be on the computer 

554.35 560.27 A: he would i don't even know how many hours he he gets off at work at like at four would start at six and he'd be working until midnight 

560.43 567.90 A: you know and so um but he was just getting back into it but it is a way for people to get back in especially if they can get the the student loans 

567.25 568.39 B: mhm 

567.97 571.48 A: and um [laughter] even apply for those online 

570.51 571.35 B: [laughter] 

571.62 572.78 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

572.33 574.56 B: yeah our taxes are online n- now 

574.35 577.20 A: oh yes absolutely i do mine online 

577.27 588.08 A: it even tells me when i mess up [laughter] you know we cannot accept this okay why and you pay online i pay my bills online but i also think that kids should learn how to do that too 

578.89 580.31 B: [laughter] 

587.80 589.02 B: right 

588.53 598.22 A: um i remember in seventh or eight grade we had to learn how to write a check and nowadays you should learn have to learn to write a paper check and and pay online i think 

598.12 599.62 B: definitely 

599.02 599.95 A: and learn sec-
