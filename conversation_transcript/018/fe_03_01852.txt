0.02 1.70 B: i'm abraham 

2.50 4.24 A: hi this is suzie 

5.34 6.29 A: how are you 

6.06 11.48 B: oh i'm fine i was like i heard the beep and i was like am i supposed to wait for it to stop or something 

7.01 8.89 A: good 

10.88 16.19 A: [laughter] i was waiting for it to stop so i could go and then i realized it's not going to 

11.56 12.81 B: [laughter] 

14.29 15.51 B: [laughter] 

16.44 17.64 A: so how are you 

17.26 18.94 B: i'm good 

18.20 20.00 A: good have you done this before 

19.53 20.82 B: no so 

20.25 21.76 A: okay well neither have i 

21.98 26.88 A: so [laughter] we're supposed to discuss education and computers i guess 

26.22 27.82 B: (( first time [laughter] yeah )) 

27.49 31.75 A: um so what are your thoughts about whether it improves the the ah 

32.31 34.53 A: learning experience or harms it 

34.21 36.74 B: um i think it's a good thing 

36.84 49.13 B: um as long as you can as long the students can stay focused on the task at hand computers haven't really helped i've had classes where you've had to use laptops in class and do research in class 

41.97 43.27 A: mhm 

49.13 54.30 B: and things like that and also just the internet being the advanced resource it is 

54.25 56.09 A: yeah 

54.46 58.22 B: and you know to begin with i think that's why it's a good tool 

57.60 59.46 A: mhm 

58.72 62.25 B: as long as you can you know go find val- val- what 

62.61 74.25 B: sort of valid sources [laughter] and um you can tell them apart from you know just people just getting on the internet and putting whatever they want to and other than that i think it's a pretty good resource 

71.50 72.37 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

74.02 79.30 A: yeah i i think it definitely enhances the learning process it you know i 

79.31 80.30 A: um 

80.55 88.87 A: i think that if kids spend too much time on the computer it can cause just as many problems as if they spend too much time in front of the t._v. 

84.08 84.91 B: yeah 

88.83 103.17 A: in terms of they have to be entertained or they're totally desensitized to the violence or the violent images that they see and um it doesn't even affect them after a while because they spend so much time looking 

103.16 105.67 A: at these games that they might be playing 

105.70 108.86 A: or um websites that they're visiting 

109.47 113.47 A: and um i also think it leads to inactivity and 

113.68 117.49 A: [noise] obesity if they spend too much time in front of the computer 

117.12 117.99 B: true 

118.08 120.97 A: so i think that in moderation 

121.06 124.81 A: it it's a good thing like you said the internet is ah 

125.05 126.79 A: an incredible invention 

126.95 139.92 A: that we didn't have when i was in well high school we did in college i'm not that old but yeah so i would of loved to have that when i was growing up through elementary and junior high and high school it would of helped 

129.51 130.70 B: [laughter] 

140.11 145.16 A: incredibly [noise] it would of been much easier to do at home [noise] just one second sweetie 

145.64 152.70 B: that's very true i see what you're saying if you combine that with the t._v. and oh that's trouble 

152.34 153.71 A: mhm 

153.99 155.64 B: but yeah um 

156.06 160.29 B: me personally i i do so much work for school on the computer it's like 

160.41 165.49 B: i try my i try not to spend too much time like i usually don't have a lot of time to 

165.62 168.52 B: just be on the internet and just look around 

168.66 178.03 B: so from my experience it's mostly work but um yeah i definitely see what you mean 'cause i didn't really have it when i was little either so 

169.02 169.85 A: mm 

178.13 180.47 B: (( i didn't have it 'til high school so )) 

180.22 182.17 A: oh okay now are you a 

181.11 182.83 B: i know where you're coming from 

182.76 184.64 A: are you taking classes now 

184.29 186.93 B: yeah i'm on my last semester at college 

186.85 189.07 A: oh okay what are you studying 

188.90 191.00 B: marketing and international business 

191.16 194.41 A: oh okay what what university do you do to 

194.07 195.42 B: temple 

195.37 198.51 A: and where's that oh okay 

196.12 197.50 B: in philadelphia 

199.74 203.55 A: (( [noise] okay just one second sweetie can you take your baby over there please )) 

203.75 204.69 A: thank you 

206.72 208.13 A: so um 

210.02 213.56 A: yeah i don't i don't see how um the ah 

214.66 220.22 A: well i do see how computers could harm the learning experience but i think it's minute 

220.23 224.55 A: ah in comparison to how much it enhances it 

224.16 234.86 B: yeah definitely the best part is being able to have ah like magazines and newspapers and everything like that all cataloged in right at the click of a mouse as opposed to 

225.32 226.70 A: mhm 

233.71 235.03 A: i know 

234.89 238.38 B: you know going to a large library or ah a 

238.85 244.21 B: like a a one of those places where they keep ah all the old newspapers and magazines 

244.24 247.25 B: in stock and things like that those places aren't really 

247.93 258.06 B: you know not everybody can find a place like that so and not all libraries have every publication so having it at the click of a mouse is so convenient you 

252.03 253.43 A: (( right )) 

259.62 263.73 A: right exactly the only other um 

264.73 270.49 A: there's a million upsides um but the only other downside that occurred to me is um 

271.17 274.38 A: the lack of ah 

274.70 276.61 A: proper socialization 

277.26 280.86 A: you don't have to interact with people as much 

280.84 281.79 B: (( know yeah )) 

281.09 290.14 A: you don't have to [noise] actually talk to people as much whether it be a tutor or a teacher or a librarian or what have you 

290.22 291.19 A: um 

291.78 296.70 A: it's much easier just to get everything done without ever speaking to another human being you know what i mean 

296.44 308.55 B: yeah you know what i know exactly what you mean 'cause i well i tried to take a on line class this semester it didn't really work out too well it's a combination of the teacher and his style i had him before i knew how he was 

308.52 316.54 B: but at the same time it was really hard to um to you know ask questions if you need to ask a question 

316.68 327.73 B: or ah if you wanted to meet with people in class it's not like you see the same the same people every other day like you had to find time in your schedule to go meet the people and things like that 

327.37 329.57 A: yeah 

327.55 334.52 B: you had to find time to go into the teacher's office after go meet him but it wasn't that kind of interaction so it did make it a little harder to learn 

334.54 338.51 B: so i had to switch out and get a regular you know old fashioned class 

338.49 347.89 A: yeah [laughter] an old fashioned class wow that makes me feel old but yeah i i totally understand what you mean it it can just be 

340.13 341.41 B: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

342.47 344.19 B: oh i'm sorry 

348.10 352.38 A: so isolating you know you would never have to 

350.86 351.70 B: yeah 

352.55 356.44 A: well whether you were working or studying or 

356.58 360.65 A: writing a paper or whatever you just would never have to talk to another human being 

360.26 361.25 B: (( exactly )) 

361.69 369.61 A: but i'd never actually taken one of those on line courses i so i've never experienced it myself but i can imagine that it would be more 

361.71 362.88 B: especially with these 

369.82 371.10 A: difficult 

371.38 373.98 B: yeah i didn't even make it a week i don't think [laughter] 

374.12 377.73 A: yeah yeah 

374.80 375.68 B: (( nah )) 

376.17 380.94 B: but you see now then now they got um you can get your degree completely on line they 

380.76 381.79 A: mhm 

380.99 385.21 B: complete on line universities and all that that's 

385.44 387.00 B: that one's beyond me 

388.24 389.74 A: yeah 

389.96 391.06 B: so um 

390.21 395.76 A: yeah i think it's you know the more i think about it and talk about it the more i think it's kind of a toss up at first i thought 

395.95 397.92 A: well of course it enhances 

397.97 400.58 A: the educational experience but 

400.88 406.11 A: now i'm thinking well it's [laughter] kinda fifty fifty since there's a lot 

404.44 407.29 B: yeah you can only go so far towards 

407.80 416.57 B: i i don't see how to get a complete education on line is really gonna work that's kinda hard it takes a lot away from the process that 

416.73 418.95 B: i just couldn't see myself doing it 

418.93 429.85 A: yeah i would think definitely if you got an entire degree on line that you would definitely be lacking because part of the whole experience of education is going to the university and 

430.08 440.81 A: interacting with people and meeting people and getting in study groups and that's the whole experience and if you're just in your apartment or in your house 

431.12 432.15 B: yeah 

441.42 443.27 A: with your on line classes 

443.06 443.95 B: [laughter] 

443.42 450.87 A: you're not getting even a third of it i wouldn't think you'd get the knowledge part down but there again we're back towards the 

450.90 455.10 A: the socialization part you're not lauren please don't write on that 

456.18 457.60 A: [noise] okay thank you 

458.42 461.09 A: but yeah the socialization part you're not getting 

461.79 463.03 A: and um 

463.39 464.22 A: well 

464.38 467.95 A: a million other things that i could spend the next twenty minutes listing 

467.76 474.83 B: no definitely [laughter] definitely i mean the only thing good about that is that it forces you to study harder 'cause you don't have that interaction 

474.77 489.47 B: you have to study harder to understand things or else you're not gonna get it you're not gonna you know you're not gonna do well but i couldn't imagine having gone through these last four years without that interaction the social interaction it probably it's the best part of being here 

481.11 483.17 A: (( yeah )) 

489.53 490.92 B: in school 

490.29 497.54 A: i know i know that's true that's yeah you would be missing out on so much i would think it would make the learning process 

491.34 492.85 B: you meet so many people 

497.63 500.23 A: very dry and boring 

500.66 506.04 A: and if you had a question it certainly wouldn't be very easy to get it answered you couldn't necessarily stay after class 

505.64 506.64 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

506.05 507.84 A: i mean i'm sure they have 

508.03 510.94 A: i don't know how but i'm sure they have ways set up on the 

511.25 512.49 A: on line 

512.65 518.77 A: get your degree on line to ask questions but you know do you have to wait twenty four hours 

519.18 521.25 A: for a response 

520.23 523.69 B: (( yeah email i suppose they'll get back to you at some point )) 

522.84 532.85 A: [laughter] exactly and then if that brings up another question okay you send another email and then you wait another day [laughter] that that would get very tedious and very annoying i would think 

528.70 530.04 B: yeah 

532.25 533.31 B: yes 

534.31 536.15 B: yes yes yes 

537.59 541.10 B: (( so [mn] i'm sorry um )) 

541.55 543.25 B: yeah you made me really realize how 

543.46 544.56 B: (( like i thought it was )) 

544.93 547.55 B: i i i i ah had 

547.75 549.36 B: to broaden 

549.53 556.74 B: my idea of the whole computers in education 'cause when she first said that i'm just thinking oh you mean like using powerpoint and everything but 

556.65 557.73 A: (( mm )) 

556.82 560.32 B: once you bring the internet in it's a whole nother monster 

561.03 564.14 A: yeah yeah 

564.34 569.46 B: 'cause i definitely use microsoft office a lot 'cause actually being a business major 

569.27 570.33 A: mhm 

569.64 575.32 B: doing all types of presentations and papers and you know things like that but 

575.75 578.39 B: (( um we yeah when she started talking about the )) 

578.57 581.26 B: internet that's where that's a whole nother monster 

580.92 584.29 A: well yeah it opens up the whole world to you at your fingertips 

584.62 589.01 A: it's it's incredible if you really think about what did we do before the internet 

589.53 590.89 A: it's just amazing 

589.90 590.83 B: yeah 

593.00 595.77 B: and i and it's all and it's so fast now too 

595.81 597.73 B: that you can get everything like 

596.00 597.75 A: oh yeah 

598.45 599.58 A: oh yeah
