5.63 7.19 A: hi lindsay i'm deb 

7.66 8.81 B: you're deb 

8.56 9.94 A: deb d. e. b. 

9.76 11.56 B: d. e. b. nice to meet you 

11.20 12.21 A: you too 

12.62 16.90 B: so what our topic is education computers in education eh 

16.52 18.37 A: yes that's what it sounds like 

19.81 21.90 A: [mn] you wanna go first [laughter] 

21.30 26.63 B: well i don't have a anything prepared to say um i think it's um it's you know 

26.65 34.97 B: computers have become prevalent in our society and i think it's important that our kids understand how to use them and um i'm sort of amazed by 

34.96 44.07 B: how um excellent my son has become very you know over the years and it's been interesting to me he's he's fifteen now and my daughter's um 

44.18 47.90 B: twenty and a col- um a sophomore in college 

47.45 48.51 A: right 

47.92 50.99 B: and just in the four years between 

51.01 53.70 B: them he's actually almost sixteen um 

54.92 62.13 B: um it's it's he was introduced to them much earlier on in his education and ah it's been very 

59.73 60.87 A: right 

62.90 65.16 B: i think it's been easier for him 

65.24 67.12 B: to be off and running with it 

67.06 69.99 A: oh i i think you're right i have seven year old twins 

69.74 70.56 B: oh you do 

70.39 73.32 A: yeah and ah one's a boy and one's a girl 

70.93 71.94 B: okay 

73.54 74.58 A: and 

73.60 74.90 B: that's a handful 

74.76 83.73 A: yeah [laughter] yeah it is and i'm amazed also at how how quickly they've they've picked it up my son much more than my daughter 

84.69 85.37 B: (( oh )) 

85.41 90.66 A: and i'm amazed because he he has basically self taught himself 

91.15 93.40 A: ah more than what i even know 

94.22 102.09 A: and you know i'm i'm thirty eight and have worked with computers for years but this kid is just a whiz on it and um 

97.83 98.95 B: right 

102.49 111.33 A: they have they of course have the computers at school and they have computer science they're in first grade and they do have a computer science class now 

111.48 117.70 A: and i i think that's great you know because they they do need that because you know we are such a um 

117.92 119.14 A: information 

119.67 122.51 A: highway society at at this point 

122.52 125.21 A: um but i think they need to learn 

125.61 128.27 A: the basics before we put them on the computer 

128.47 129.42 A: you know 

128.77 137.36 B: oh i think you're absolutely right in fact um it's interesting you'd say that i i have a friend who's son was asked um 

138.11 145.54 B: this was this was quite a while back but when he was in maybe third or fourth grade he um was such a 

145.52 155.67 B: ah competent user of the computer that he never really he was sort of resisting learning how to write properly and his teacher ended up insisting that he not turn in typed 

152.20 153.14 A: yes 

155.63 162.44 B: papers that his that anything his work needed to be handwritten [laughter] so that he could master um how to use 

159.29 160.17 A: yeah 

162.62 164.44 B: you know the pen and ink 

164.36 168.03 A: yeah and and that's fair i i think that's very fair 

168.50 171.28 A: you know 'cause what i'm seeing now is 

171.32 175.61 A: you know they they know how to do everything on the computer but you you know if you 

175.72 178.43 A: ask them to sit down and write two and two 

178.72 180.52 A: you know they're not as quick 

180.49 186.84 B: yes yeah and i and i wonder about research skills um it's sort of it's 

181.73 182.68 A: (( you know so )) 

188.15 195.19 B: you know i remember you know as a child myself going to the library and wandering around the the um 

195.66 200.18 B: you know the stacks and kind of wandering from book to book and doing 

196.91 197.82 A: yeah 

200.19 210.21 B: doing a lot of wandering around the pages reading and and doing my own research and now it's if research is reduced to simply doing google searches um 

209.56 210.55 A: yeah 

210.32 213.84 B: i wonder if something is lost in the translation 

213.90 221.53 A: you know i i think you might you know that that's a very good point also i do know that that the school that's around here and we're northern virginia 

221.68 226.16 A: and um and it's a fantastic school the school is only four years old 

226.03 227.40 B: is it a public school 

227.09 228.05 A: yes 

227.59 228.46 B: uh-huh 

228.64 230.94 A: and i was raised in a private school 

230.80 234.78 A: so you know i was so scared to put them in a public school 

234.64 246.42 A: but um this has been just a godsend because they do have they do have library on mondays they do have the dewey decimal system they do have um you know the card catalogs 

246.27 249.83 A: and that kind of thing so they are still teaching them that 

249.40 255.06 B: well that's good to hear because my children are a little bit older and you know of course they did have the library experience too so 

254.16 261.33 A: right well you know we go we go down to the library at least once a week myself and my children 'cause i'm a huge reader 

259.50 260.47 B: uh-huh 

261.87 271.58 A: and um we still okay what kind of books do you are you looking for today are we looking for insects are we looking for sports okay here is um up on the wall 

272.29 281.80 A: is a poster and it has you know zero to ninety nine is this you know five ninety nine to or five hundred to six hundred is this category 

281.76 289.31 A: so um we go there and decide what kind of books that we're going to look for and then go through the stacks that way and figure it out 

288.04 292.78 B: oh you sound you're pro- like you're providing lots of enrichment to you children [laughter] it's so 

291.56 293.02 A: yeah well you know you 

293.65 294.77 B: (( just wonderful )) 

293.83 298.42 A: kinda sorta have to because there's not all the public schools that are as good as this one 

298.45 301.45 A: so you know i kind of feel like the parents are the back up 

301.19 303.38 B: absolutely absolutely 

303.15 308.66 A: and um and if you know it also helps me because you know i'm not the brightest egg in the basket either 

308.51 309.92 B: [laughter] 

309.01 311.32 A: you know [laughter] so it's kind of like you know 

311.70 317.92 A: this is ah if this is what i can give them i'm gonna give them what i can because they're certainly outgrowing me in a hurry 

317.95 322.35 B: well what was your exposure to computers um in your own education 

322.43 327.26 A: um i was not exposed at all until i went back to sc- 

327.29 330.09 A: until i went back to school to get my second degree 

330.43 331.38 B: uh-huh 

331.61 332.50 A: so 

333.59 339.33 A: um i i didn't have any kind of of ah computers skills given to me in school 

337.68 338.53 B: yeah 

339.10 345.08 B: well and it's interesting because you know for us for us i'm a little bit older than you but but still um 

345.45 354.17 B: the it's all been on the job education computers in education and it's just the world is so different than it was only ten years ago 

348.96 350.32 A: exactly 

354.18 354.99 B: (( just )) 

354.61 358.65 A: well you have the one of the the things that i think 

358.68 362.29 A: is impending the education system as far as computers go 

362.30 364.24 A: is that you have these 

364.98 367.24 A: you know older people like you and i 

367.30 378.13 A: you know whose experience wins out over the education you you still have the education but you've got the experience to back it up but yet you have these kids that are coming out of college 

373.43 374.21 B: yes 

378.20 382.04 A: you know or not even graduated from college yet who are getting 

382.23 383.05 A: (( you know )) 

383.25 385.83 A: um double the salary that you are 

385.91 388.74 A: because their computer skills are what's needed 

388.77 390.38 B: right right 

389.49 395.71 A: you know and and it's kinda well that's kind of um desensitizing you know [laughter] 

393.79 399.61 B: [laughter] yeah feeling marginalized even though we've got all this great experience 

399.13 404.97 A: right so so that that i kind of get a little annoyed about [laughter] 

403.62 407.16 B: (( [laughter] that's funny )) 

406.78 413.48 A: but i think that's just a you know that's the technological advances you kind of have to take a little bit when you get a little bit you know 

413.84 428.65 B: mhm well i i've um was exposed to um computer technology fairly early on in my career because i we're in northern california in um the bay area and um gosh one of my early jobs was 

424.02 425.11 A: mhm 

428.87 437.24 B: was working for a company um that had a very early version of electronic mail um this is back in the early eighties before 

435.15 435.96 A: right 

437.38 446.68 B: you know before almost anybody had a computer on their desk and everybody was pretty much reliant on mainframe so it's been part of my my um 

440.75 441.67 A: mhm 

443.94 444.81 A: right 

447.14 450.50 B: computers have been sort of part of what i do for a long time 

450.62 451.47 A: yeah 

450.66 455.79 B: um but nonetheless we didn't have a computer at home for a long time you know up until 

454.69 455.70 A: oh really 

455.84 461.10 B: well until i guess early nineties is when we first got a computer 

459.75 463.40 A: yeah yeah i i think that's about what we did also 

463.58 465.44 A: but i do have to say that 

465.63 468.44 A: you know i'm i went back to school again 

468.51 475.02 A: and ah for for something else and it made my life so much easier to have it because 

475.16 479.47 A: last or two semesters ago i took an on line history class 

479.78 480.84 B: mhm 

479.88 482.11 A: and everything was on line 

482.12 484.07 A: i didn't have to go in 

484.14 488.27 A: to the classroom at all i can do everything when i had the time to do it 

488.54 489.90 A: and um 

490.04 494.46 A: all the research was done on line and it was it was a remarkably beautifully thing 

494.37 502.45 B: well that's that's really exciting for you i have you know i have a friend who's very close to retirement age she's an english professor 

502.14 503.10 A: mhm 

502.50 509.36 B: and her husband was recently transferred to honolulu she teaches here in the bay area at a junior college 

507.61 508.39 A: right 

509.37 524.05 B: and she has one more semester of teaching to go before she can take an early retirement and she's thinking of trying to do her class um go ahead and move to hawaii and continue to teach her class here [laughter] but do the whole thing on line 

523.70 525.38 A: (( right oh and )) 

524.15 530.44 B: and and she's i think she's going to be able to pull it together she's still sort of breaking through red type tape at the faculty level 

528.80 529.72 A: right 

530.53 531.46 B: um 

530.56 535.18 A: oh it's wonderful because the class i took was in san diego and i'm in northern virginia 

534.96 536.11 B: perfect 

535.88 550.32 A: and like i said i had um you know as far as computers in education that way love it you know because i learned so much more than sitting sitting in a classroom listening to someone drone on about something that i've already read 

550.01 551.69 B: right exactly 

551.16 552.51 A: you know and and 

552.17 554.86 B: plus the logistics of getting there um 

554.54 556.02 A: ex- exactly 

555.27 562.26 B: yeah although you know i i guess i put a high value on the interaction that goes on you know the discussions and um 

562.39 567.58 A: you know i ah i think i just am one of those that tend to learn better on my own 

567.16 568.07 B: uh-huh 

568.08 571.81 A: than than one who is constant you know consistently preached to 

571.57 572.40 B: yes 

572.05 573.35 A: and um 

573.51 574.39 A: (( this )) 

573.79 576.76 B: what was it what um field of history was it 

576.58 577.52 A: i'm sorry 

577.16 579.67 B: what what aspect of history was the class 

579.07 582.75 A: oh it was the um american history to reconstruction 

582.62 583.50 B: uh-huh 

583.57 593.15 A: and it was absolutely fascinating because we we got to dig into a lot of stuff that you just don't cover in class like you know the myth of the cowboys in the wild west 

593.34 599.95 A: you know and that kind of thing and we wrote a paper on that and then we had quest- you know specific questions that we had to
