6.40 9.12 A: hi matthew so what does family mean to you 

10.24 11.44 B: (( ah ah )) 

11.66 19.32 B: i guess probably immediate family just when if i was to think of it i would just think of my father my mother and ah my two siblings 

19.33 25.55 A: ah mine is [noise] i do genealogy so i feel like we're all related and if you're from a small town 

26.21 34.52 A: everybody is related to each other i see that i can see the connections especially [cough] when you get back a couple hundred years [noise] 

28.55 29.42 B: (( oh )) 

34.74 37.55 A: you can see how people start to relate to each other 

38.72 40.85 A: that you know it's more than just 

41.50 43.28 A: just your immediate family 

44.33 48.00 A: it goes further beyond that [noise] [noise] i 

47.70 49.49 B: i would always love to ah 

50.06 52.51 B: to do that my family has 

52.85 56.66 B: ah roots in ireland and actually 

57.22 62.16 B: relations blood relations still on the same farmhouse that my great grandfather emigrated from i've always wanted 

62.26 69.87 B: to go out there and experience that and meet them but i you know i come from fairly just i live in a suburb of d._c. and so it's just you 

69.99 77.71 B: know real you know isolated sub- suburbia where you you know people co- especially washington where it's a real transient area people come and go and stuff so i mean i guess 

77.83 78.54 B: (( you know )) 

78.67 85.63 A: [noise] i don't know everybod- everyone is like that i noticed when i my husband and i are both from i was born detroit [noise] but he was born in maine 

85.81 89.52 A: and our both our families were born in the same town in machias 

90.00 101.38 A: and ah you know connecting area mine's machias and his was jones um port and i notice that we have a lot of coll- connecting lines and the further i get back the more they connect 

101.76 112.01 A: and you know i thought you know i'm from detroit how the heck can i be that closely related you know [noise] but when you start doing that you start finding out that people are more connected than they think they are 

112.34 113.37 A: (( [noise] )) 

112.56 120.06 B: would it would that old adage i think i had a professor today tell me that he was four handshakes away from ah john stuart mill 

113.50 114.10 A: (( [cough] )) 

120.41 126.29 B: just because of you know the whole six degrees of separation thing everybody is so closely related to everybody else in that sense 

126.38 128.57 B: i'm not so sure how much that actually 

126.44 127.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

127.61 128.73 A: [noise] 

129.06 132.92 B: you know holds you know 'cause i mean you coul- you could say that but at the same time i 

133.09 134.82 B: you know i don't have 

134.67 135.94 A: you have to have proof 

135.99 141.88 B: i don't have any connection in in any social sense any real feeling sense beyond 

137.36 138.11 A: right 

142.01 156.62 A: it's the same when you start doing all that and you get back and your families you start seeing like you said your family is from ireland you know and you'll go back and read your family's last name and you'll find out that in ireland a lot of their families ah 

142.14 142.93 B: (( you know )) 

156.72 163.05 A: had towns like your family was o'bryan you know they had a whole town of o'bryans 

162.97 172.11 B: yeah actually its ah we're dwyers and it's from tipperary county i'm not quite sure where in tipperary county but we we that whole side of my family originates from there 

172.87 181.39 A: [laughter] [noise] so i think that's really fascinating i love to research people's families i d- i could do that all day long [laughter] and i spend many hours 

180.23 181.85 B: wel- w- yeah 

181.53 185.35 A: reading census reports and i mean i just enjoy doing it 

185.65 196.30 B: one of my one interesting thing i would love to be able to take the time some time and do a gene- genealogy thing because that that that's one side of my family the other side of my family um is jewish and 

196.08 202.96 B: during world war two they emigrated over here and di- changed their last name destroyed all the records just in case you know america lost the war 

201.79 204.38 A: yep they di- th- that was very common 

204.21 214.23 B: so i don't even know i don't even know what happened like you know if you were to you know establish yourself you know regionally like i'm from you know germany or from ireland i don't know where half of my 

214.24 215.47 B: my genes come from 

215.29 228.63 A: well i think once you get back you find out they came from everywhere [laughter] i mean because i always thought my dad's family was german my mom's family they emigrated here in the before the mayflower 

228.83 235.83 A: you know they came over there they had that first boat that came over before everybody thinks of the mayflower but they came over before that in the sixteen hundreds 

235.96 246.73 A: and when you start doing all of that you start reading all this you think when you get back further her family came from england [laughter] and they came from ireland because i guess over in europe everybody 

247.04 255.62 A: they came from everywhere [laughter] and then you just find out people are just more connected you thin- think how foolish it is for people to get so upset over 

248.55 249.32 B: yeah 

255.95 264.45 A: religion you know it's so trivial because we were all probably related you know [noise] if you go back far enough everybody's related 

264.54 277.45 A: and it's just it's just really weird when you start seeing it i used to think of you know my little town and you thought well if you met another person with your last name you're related you know [laughter] because it's a small town and then you realize you know this really is common 

277.49 284.40 A: you are all probably related [laughter] when you go back far enough it's just getting back that far [noise] 

279.71 280.74 B: that's interesting 

281.16 281.91 B: yeah 

284.20 293.67 B: did that's that's an interesting way to think about it because i spent a good deal of this semester last semester learning about hu- the evolution of human rights and one of the sticking points especially from a western perspective 

287.51 289.19 A: [noise] 

293.65 301.12 B: is rather than you know we should disregard you know the the the dehumanizing aspects of you know 

301.51 303.53 B: what you classify yourself as 

303.09 303.96 A: right 

303.76 310.63 B: um rather instead of viewing yourself you know as as viewing yourself as isolated as everybody has their own individual autonomous 

310.73 313.88 B: sphere in that i- it would be necessary for 

313.93 314.92 B: those group 

315.17 323.15 B: group identifications and collective identities to to kind of almost you know fade away in order for that to as opposed to taking the perspective that 

319.54 320.50 A: right 

323.23 328.40 B: that were you know rather you know this is actually someone who somewhere along the line is actually you know 

328.53 331.01 B: related with in that sense being able to humanize them 

331.40 332.72 A: yeah [laughter] 

334.33 342.39 A: [noise] i don't know i just i just enjoy doing it my husband thinks i'm silly but i just enjoy doing it and i love finding other families 

342.99 348.18 A: and just finding out you know how they all came here and what's their reason for being here 

348.43 350.53 A: and it's interesting i mean it's just 

351.26 355.83 A: i could live my whole life doing this [laughter] researching for other people 

353.40 354.26 B: (( [mn] that )) 

355.61 362.44 B: that's great i i i'm still searching for what i want to do with the rest of my life so i would love to be able to find something that interested me that much so 

359.47 360.26 A: [laughter] 

362.15 364.18 A: well you're probably really young right 

363.83 366.50 B: (( yeah i'm real young so i've got some time )) 

364.89 365.85 A: oh okay 

366.31 370.52 A: [laughter] well i'm like i'm fif- getting close to fifty so 

370.43 371.61 B: (( okay [mn] )) 

371.16 380.13 A: and i think they say the average person that researched their family is in their forties so it's the time to renew and look back [laughter] so you've got lots of time 

380.29 381.01 B: (( yep )) 

381.27 389.27 A: i have young kids too i have a son that's well he's twenty and a daughter that's oh she's going to be thirty [noise] [laughter] and ah 

389.85 399.21 A: you know they're just now trying to decide what they want to do in life [laughter] you know she's thinking i'm going to be in the medical field my son he wants to do computers [laughter] 

393.32 394.03 B: yeah 

399.37 399.93 B: (( [mn] )) 

399.73 404.64 A: and me i don't i really just go with the flow [laughter] 

403.06 408.06 B: [laughter] that's probably really the bes- the only way you can actually enjoy yourself if you just accept things and go with the flow 

407.58 411.03 A: yeah just accept what happens and what goes on in life 

412.45 414.57 A: [cough] do you have a big family 

414.54 416.02 B: um 

416.11 421.11 B: in five people in my immediate family my dad's side's a big family and my mom's side is pretty much 

421.27 432.94 B: so my dad's side's all interconnected and real close and cousins all live within the same area that they've they've lived when they first came over i guess three generations ago so a fairly close area so it's nice 

429.94 431.91 A: (( oh i see that's great )) 

432.47 436.45 A: see we both moved away so we have no connections here 

436.47 442.06 A: in our town i mean we live in ohio so we have no connection to anybody here 

442.18 449.18 A: [cough] it's just funny because our kids will be the first ones and they've lived in one area their whole life so they consider this is where they're from 

449.63 450.67 A: and ah 

451.12 456.35 A: that's probably what they will always feel but really their family is not from here our family is from east [laughter] 

456.90 467.29 A: and ah it's just odd how it i think that now the world is everybody is just like it like you said the family is just you and your you know your parent 

467.24 467.99 B: yeah 

467.39 471.15 A: but years ago it was more the whole community was your family 

471.34 474.04 A: the whole town because you were related to everybody 

474.50 478.21 A: you know [noise] you would dare not say anything to your neighbor it might be a cousin 

478.42 479.51 B: (( [laughter] )) 

478.61 483.90 A: they knew your parents [laughter] and they would call and tell on you hey he did this 

484.42 488.79 A: [mn] so there's there's a big difference to the change over on families 

488.95 490.65 A: they are more isolated 

490.60 492.12 B: what do you think's the cause of that [mn] 

492.59 497.07 A: i think the the when towns started um 

497.32 504.36 A: not reinforcing in keeping their their children home by going keeping up with the times you know like um 

504.39 513.41 A: [cough] to give you an example our small town um had no jobs for the children most kids didn't want to lobster fish or they didn't want to clam dig 

513.74 516.99 A: okay our town did not want to 

517.60 523.64 A: [noise] make an airport so that you could bring in revenue you know like have people come travel to the town 

523.70 537.30 A: hunters you know and stuff like that so they wouldn't go with the flow well these kids had to make a living and the only way to make a living is to join a service and leave the area so they leave the area and you lose all your ties when you move away 

537.74 544.75 A: you don't have the ties to your family yeah sure you love and you talk to y- your parents but you lose touch with cousins 

545.57 547.56 A: and if a town don't grow 

547.65 550.09 A: and your kids all leave your town 

550.71 556.98 A: all their connections are gone they've started somewhere else you know so the the ties are all broken 

556.89 557.69 B: yeah 

557.52 560.13 A: if the you know the idea is if you want your 

560.40 562.38 A: kids to have that neat 

562.42 567.46 A: little set unit you need to the towns need to advance 

567.49 569.08 A: keep their kids 

569.22 572.64 A: able to support themself to stay why would they want to leave 

573.17 579.43 A: you know most people when you talk to small peo- people that live in small towns will either leave home if there's no you know i can't money back there 

579.89 582.30 A: you know i had to go i had to go to the big city 

582.69 588.60 B: yeah do you think it's possible though to be able to move all that that type of industrial tech- technological 

583.24 583.96 A: (( [laughter] )) 

588.88 594.37 B: opportunities into small towns without either they themselves like getting bigger or [mn] you know 

594.48 599.89 B: just not physically possible to actually do that to move centres of eco- econom- economy into
