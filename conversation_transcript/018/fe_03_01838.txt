14.06 15.84 B: okay [laughter] 

15.92 19.15 A: so so we are talking about education and computers 

18.69 22.34 B: yes well i taught high school for ten years 

20.99 22.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

22.58 24.72 B: and i use computers all the time 

23.87 24.44 A: [noise] 

25.23 29.08 B: and i thought they were a big well especially in the math 

29.37 32.54 B: um program that i was in they were a big help 

31.44 33.22 A: [noise] yeah 

34.27 36.84 A: [mn] well i have two 

37.02 38.81 A: [noise] two small children 

39.43 40.67 A: and 

40.74 42.02 A: (( um [mn] )) 

43.06 51.50 A: i don't know how much they use computers at school but i know my son uses a computer a lot here [noise] when he was younger um we bought a lot of those 

51.86 53.70 A: (( like re- reader rabbit )) 

53.59 54.63 B: mhm 

54.03 58.49 A: [noise] games and stuff like that and i think it really helped him to learn [noise] 

58.29 59.26 B: right 

58.73 60.43 A: learn a lot [mn] 

59.85 63.49 B: right well i know i have two daughters also ten and seven 

63.68 67.86 B: and they use them in school too and just for the keyboarding 

68.02 69.73 B: and being able to 

70.66 71.68 B: um 

72.24 78.39 B: type in things you know i mean they are learning the keyboarding on the computer and i just think all of those skills are 

75.48 76.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

78.76 80.36 B: going to be necessary 

80.26 83.54 A: yeah i don't i don't think there is any jobs now where you don't 

83.61 85.15 A: where you don't have a computer 

85.00 87.78 B: right [laughter] so 

85.71 87.88 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

89.21 92.82 A: well i know my son um in their classroom well 

93.10 98.65 A: he just recently switched schools at their old school they had i think six computers in their classroom 

98.70 101.28 A: and they each took turns during the day 

102.50 111.76 A: [mn] they each had like a half hour or something where they could play game on it do math problems and stuff like that and he really enjoyed that and learned a lot from it 

112.20 112.76 A: (( [mn] )) 

113.05 114.19 A: so now 

114.48 117.43 A: now i think they have at his school they have um what 

117.56 118.12 A: (( the )) 

121.10 122.70 B: (( do they have like a lab )) 

122.26 132.96 A: heck is it called yeah like all the first grade classrooms and the second grade classrooms are together you know and in the middle they have computers and i think they go out there periodically throughout the day and they have to type 

126.20 127.10 B: right 

128.53 129.54 B: right 

133.50 136.96 A: [mn] they have to take turns typing newsletters every week 

137.37 139.08 A: so i think it really helps them 

139.01 144.39 B: well that sounds good yeah my my girls have they have computers in their classroom and they each get 

139.97 143.61 A: (( learn how to do that [mn] )) 

144.53 150.00 B: ah one day a week where they can get on it where they rotate with other kids and 

150.31 151.69 B: and 

152.51 160.68 B: you know even just doing i like i remember when i was teaching the kids that that was when where in the world is carmen san diego had come out and 

159.87 160.96 A: oh yeah 

160.83 164.78 B: you know a lot of those they just make learning your geography 

162.15 163.09 A: (( [cough] )) 

164.82 165.78 B: fun 

165.50 166.44 A: yeah 

167.51 170.28 A: [lipsmack] that's what they just had um 

170.29 173.99 A: my son's in second grade and they have to do reports like 

174.16 176.47 A: big reports they had to do a president report 

176.38 177.43 B: mhm 

176.73 182.52 A: and um most of it they did at school because the computer was there they di- they looked up stuff on the internet 

180.53 181.47 B: right 

182.54 186.65 A: and they typed the stuff up o- you know there at school 

185.45 186.32 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

187.39 190.89 A: so i think it's a lot you know when i went to school we didn't have 

191.23 192.93 A: computers in the classroom 

193.03 205.73 B: same here [laughter] so and i know even when i was in college with a math degree and i had a minor in computer science and things were just starting then things have gone 

193.68 195.10 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

196.83 197.92 A: (( [mn] )) 

199.93 201.10 A: (( [cough] )) 

205.74 208.84 B: way beyond from even when i was in college so 

208.21 209.49 A: oh yeah 

209.65 211.29 B: it is really incredible 

210.10 211.54 A: that's what i think they're [sigh] 

213.72 217.29 A: they're a lot better off now w- with the computers than 

217.82 218.90 A: before 

218.57 220.09 B: oh absolutely 

219.28 224.11 A: you can get so much more information and do so much more than you could 

224.20 225.87 A: could b- before 

225.45 236.01 B: right just well even with the internet as you said and the reports that they are writing and and being able to type them up and i didn't learn typing 'til high school 

235.49 238.00 A: (( yep that's when i did it )) 

236.25 238.23 B: and and they're already 

238.31 244.32 B: you know they know the keyboard and are able to do much more than i could have done so 

243.16 244.29 A: yeah 

244.38 246.67 A: kids know a lot more than some adults 

246.07 252.42 B: yeah [laughter] they do well my youngest she was on the computer at three and just going to town 

253.26 261.22 B: and and and i know a lot of parents even some relatives they worry about their kids oh they are going to do something that messes it up and 

253.64 254.31 A: (( [laughter] )) 

261.56 264.14 B: i didn't worry about that and she was 

264.22 265.17 B: you know 

266.28 269.28 B: surfing around and going through her games and 

269.99 271.33 B: and just learning 

271.58 275.59 B: you know with her phonics and basic math and 

273.32 274.37 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

276.75 282.06 A: that's where my two year old is now she wants to get on the computer every every day 

278.63 279.88 B: yeah 

281.61 282.91 B: [laughter] 

282.38 285.16 A: you know just because she wants to play a game on there 

284.68 285.64 B: sure 

285.83 292.44 A: there's lot there's a lot more i think computer games are a lot you can't find that many educational games 

292.65 294.33 A: besides computer games 

294.79 295.71 B: right 

296.75 297.92 B: exactly 

299.37 301.71 B: so i'm all for it 

299.54 300.41 A: (( [mn] )) 

301.23 302.63 A: i'm all for it too 

302.03 311.26 B: i'm all up for computers in the classroom and like i say i use them for doing demonstrations of math problems where you could graphically see 

310.80 312.07 A: yeah 

311.47 320.16 B: equations and things and they could learn you know it worked better than me or them drawing them on the chalk board 

320.26 327.26 B: i could project them on the screen with the computer and they could pick up the pattern so much more quickly 

326.98 328.00 A: oh yeah 

327.69 330.03 B: that way and so it was a time saver 

328.40 329.62 A: (( and they can see )) 

329.86 331.81 A: (( see a lot more instead of having a )) 

332.06 335.05 B: for the teacher as well for demonstrations 

333.69 334.54 A: yeah 

337.08 341.85 A: yeah and it's um it's a lot easier to type a report on a computer than a typewriter 

341.65 347.69 B: yes as a matter of fact my my one of my daughters got on my old typewriter and how come it doesn't work mum how 

347.03 348.26 A: [laughter] 

347.80 355.49 B: come they don't make ribbons any more [laughter] we should even not even keep it around but [laughter] 

348.85 353.47 A: [mn] [laughter] [laughter] 

354.05 356.03 A: yeah 

357.05 360.93 A: yeah that's what we have one that we had to use every once in a while just 

359.45 363.64 B: mhm well i remember sitting and typing my reports on this old 

363.40 367.22 A: yeah and you have to type and if you mess up you have to start all over 

364.05 365.63 B: typewriter and 

366.83 375.05 B: yeah and plus you could come up with fancy fonts and you know it's it makes it funner i think even to do the report 

375.91 381.78 B: that you can you know do the different colors and put in pictures and 

382.01 384.16 B: things like that so 

383.30 387.19 A: yeah that's what my son gets excited when he has to write reports because 

387.38 389.31 A: he gets to type them on the computer 

389.13 390.38 B: yeah 

389.65 394.79 A: and like you know and i think that's good whereas me you know i hated 

394.81 397.92 A: writing reports because i knew i had to type them on the typewriter 

397.63 398.63 B: right 

397.95 399.58 A: one time i mess up 

399.60 401.49 A: you know i've got to start all over 

400.14 407.20 B: that's it [laughter] all i know i my college room mate she used to ask me to type her reports for her because she didn't know how 

404.84 405.45 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

407.37 408.76 B: and i did 

409.27 411.19 B: and so 

413.18 418.72 B: that's great that he's excited about doing the reports even that was always just 

419.02 421.36 B: oh not a report [sigh] 

420.18 420.83 A: (( [laughter] )) 

421.06 426.62 A: yeah [laughter] i'm sure it won't be that way a- after a couple of years [laughter] [laughter] 

424.24 432.43 B: [laughter] well i think they have fun searching for information rather than having to look stuff up in the library i 

429.04 430.58 A: (( yeah )) 

431.74 432.84 A: (( [mn] )) 

433.16 434.83 A: yeah and it's a lot 

433.87 435.96 B: mean they still do that too but 

436.98 440.18 B: there is so much more available and 

437.69 438.79 A: (( [cough] [mn] )) 

441.34 445.09 A: yeah that's what when they had to do their like they had to do the presidents reports 

441.56 442.30 B: (( so )) 

445.29 450.76 A: they each got so much time to go on the internet every day and look up the stuff and 

447.64 448.55 B: mhm 

451.89 453.99 A: he'd come home with tonnes of stuff 

451.92 455.64 B: mine were doing reports recently on on penguins 

455.84 459.93 B: and we actually found sites that had video clips 

460.20 461.27 A: yeah 

460.41 466.25 B: of the penguins and the sounds they make and you could never find that in the library before 

465.56 468.90 A: oh no not even in a movie half the time 

468.45 469.48 B: right 

470.33 472.16 A: [sigh] i mean nature movies but you 

473.14 475.24 A: don't find those very easily 

475.01 481.04 B: no they are not you know with the specific breed of penguin or variety of penguin they had and 

480.41 481.35 A: right 

481.58 484.23 B: so they were having a great old time 

486.73 487.68 A: (( [noise] um )) 

489.04 489.97 A: hold on 

491.77 493.83 A: let's see what else 

495.89 501.94 B: well i think we've we both agree they're they're a definite asset to the classroom [laughter] 

500.65 503.52 A: [laughter] yes they are a asset to the classroom 

502.91 511.21 B: and they just make learning more fun and exciting and and and again from the teacher's point of view using them as a reward 

511.49 517.57 B: for things you know you get time on the computer as a reward i think they are a great tool for the teacher 

514.03 516.63 A: [noise] yeah 

520.80 522.11 A: (( great tool )) 

524.11 528.17 A: across a broad a broad range of stuff they can learn too more than 

529.09 530.84 A: [noise] they had before 

530.97 532.03 B: right 

531.43 531.99 A: [noise] 

532.69 534.63 A: without going to the library 

536.06 539.81 A: [noise] you can do most of your stuff at home or at school without [noise] 

539.98 541.28 A: going anywhere [sigh] 

541.23 542.21 B: yes 

543.69 545.58 B: it is right at your fingertips 

547.81 548.62 A: [noise] 

549.07 550.12 A: um 

550.64 552.37 A: (( i think we have a long time left )) 

552.28 555.81 B: i know [laughter] it is not a controversial topic so [laughter] 

552.42 554.65 A: [laughter] 

555.59 556.79 A: (( [noise] i know )) 

556.40 557.65 B: [laughter] 

557.88 559.47 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

560.91 563.17 B: i i can't really think of any 

563.46 565.19 B: drawbacks or or 

566.14 569.41 B: problems with having them in the classroom and 

568.86 577.75 A: [mn] well the only drawback i could see people thinking as you know playing games they won't want their kids pl- if they play games or you know 

577.60 583.14 B: right well i think you know being in in the classroom i think that's up to the teacher to monitor and 

581.69 583.36 A: [noise] yeah 

583.57 587.52 B: keep control of and again on the other hand if a child's 

588.11 591.13 B: you know ca- she can use that as a reward 

590.41 591.55 A: (( [cough] )) 

591.51 594.05 B: you know as long as they are monitoring 

594.39 599.89 B: the content that they are finding on the internet and i think most schools employ a filter 

595.63 596.22 A: [noise]
