7.74 10.09 A: so what does the word family mean to you 

11.17 14.48 B: i have mixed feelings about it 

14.82 15.81 A: yeah 

16.20 17.80 B: what's it mean to you 

18.30 19.55 A: um 

19.86 24.28 A: well i i tend to believe that a family is a group of people who 

24.40 30.43 A: um you know call themselves that that it can be pretty much self defined that it's a group of people who live and 

31.13 37.23 A: live together usually but not always and that um you know feel very very tied to each other 

37.67 44.40 A: whether it's parents and children or siblings or adopted family members i think it's pretty it can be pretty open 

44.91 48.28 A: in my opinion my experience is it has been pretty you 

48.61 49.93 A: know sort of 

50.01 52.29 A: normal family but um 

52.69 55.48 A: i i feel like you know it can be open 

55.97 60.08 A: open to what to what works for for folks in the world 

60.20 61.36 A: what do you think 

62.62 68.73 B: ah family is ties to certain people 

68.20 69.19 A: mhm 

69.43 70.82 B: (( basically it )) 

70.57 72.22 A: what kind of people do you think 

73.11 75.92 B: would be like your mother or father 

73.18 74.63 A: like you say certain 

74.99 75.82 A: (( ahah )) 

76.85 78.59 B: or um 

79.82 83.74 B: what and and relatives of them 

83.17 83.97 A: (( ahah )) 

84.39 86.13 B: grandparents 

87.33 90.99 B: ah uncles and 

91.92 94.51 B: ah in laws 

93.96 94.77 A: (( ahah )) 

96.35 98.36 B: that's all family 

97.80 98.63 A: right 

99.61 102.24 B: (( and um so i think )) 

101.62 102.56 A: mhm 

103.95 105.42 A: what about um 

105.45 110.27 A: what do you think about families who adopt children do you think that those children 

110.29 113.95 A: that their family is their adopted family or their original birth family 

114.19 117.01 B: i think it's their adopted family 

116.36 117.39 A: mhm 

117.64 119.09 A: why do you think that 

117.81 120.18 B: because they're the ones they're living with 

119.63 122.15 A: yeah so families like 

122.94 127.27 B: whereas they got their genes and everything from their 

127.41 130.79 B: original mother and father 

130.21 131.04 A: right 

133.76 135.38 A: so in that case it's like ha- 

134.48 139.02 B: and then when they find those roots sometimes they find out what makes 'em tick 

138.69 139.56 A: right 

139.83 143.79 B: and they should be able to do that at some time 

143.01 143.96 A: yeah 

144.94 147.14 B: that's the way you feel about 'em 

146.57 148.79 A: well sometimes i wonder 'cause there's certain 

149.07 156.22 A: you know certain adoptions happen because the mother is in some kind of danger or whatever and it's not always um 

157.19 163.77 A: you know it's not always safe for for the mother to be able to make herself known to the children if i were adopted i would absolutely want to be able to find out 

164.01 170.17 A: um you know just the basic information if not be able to meet my birth parents but just at least know 

170.40 173.27 A: you know what was going on in their lives 

170.96 171.90 B: yeah 

174.06 175.13 A: um 

176.02 179.64 A: and i think in an ideal world everyone will be able to find out 

179.97 182.82 B: well they're passing laws to make it easier 

182.22 183.22 A: mhm 

184.22 186.65 B: my wife does 

187.25 188.86 B: um 

190.15 192.76 B: adopted birth birth 

192.90 195.87 B: mother and father searches 

195.33 196.44 A: oh she does 

196.80 199.50 B: she does that on the side as a hobby 

198.90 199.80 A: uh-huh 

200.12 205.17 B: and if anybody ever gets a hold of her she can find 'em for 'em and she does that for nothing 

204.63 205.63 A: (( wow )) 

205.87 208.92 B: but not too many people would get a hold of her 

208.38 209.23 A: right 

209.50 214.19 B: and when they do they don't want to do the things they are supposed to do to find them 

214.06 215.56 A: what what like what 

215.35 218.13 B: well they have to find their birth certificates 

217.52 218.76 A: yeah 

219.57 224.36 B: find different things that only they can do she can't look up their birth certificates 

223.80 230.88 A: right right right so that takes a lot of work on that person's part they can't just hand off the job to somebody else 

228.73 229.58 B: (( what )) 

231.45 234.09 A: they can't just hand off that job to somebody else 

233.91 239.01 B: right they have to do some of the work but she can find the names of the people and all 

235.62 236.53 A: right 

238.45 239.27 A: right 

239.09 243.37 B: and pretty well locate who the mother is and who the father is 

242.79 243.58 A: (( ahah )) 

244.14 246.22 B: or at least who the mother is 

245.64 246.37 A: (( ahah )) 

247.20 251.12 B: and ah if they want to contact 'em they can 

250.65 251.48 A: right 

251.63 255.81 B: she can't put 'em in touch with them they have to call themselves 

255.32 258.08 A: right so she can get the get the information for them 

258.02 260.80 B: (( yeah and if they don't want to call well )) 

261.99 263.08 B: at least they 

263.99 265.82 B: know who it is 

265.21 266.24 A: yeah 

266.37 270.79 B: if they want to call them she found the birth mother of 

267.43 268.50 A: right 

271.04 272.86 B: a friend of ours 

273.30 275.95 B: who was curious about it one day 

275.42 276.26 A: (( ahah )) 

276.65 278.08 B: and ah 

278.93 282.67 B: never has gotten the nerve up in three years to get in touch with her 

282.03 284.77 A: right so people just want the information but they don't 

285.08 286.96 A: they don't necessarily want to find out 

286.88 288.03 B: they don't want 

287.78 290.68 A: yeah that's true that would be scary can you imagine 

288.80 289.97 B: (( to know )) 

290.52 291.53 B: yeah 

290.95 295.07 A: never knowing and then how much it would change your concept of like who you are and 

295.08 296.80 A: and all that kind of stuff 

296.58 298.10 B: what's you're ah 

298.49 303.26 B: what type of person they are and and their history and stuff 

300.03 300.99 A: right 

302.67 303.56 A: right 

303.63 304.65 A: that's right 

305.03 308.49 B: whether they are college graduates or 

307.70 310.21 A: yeah yeah 

308.53 309.62 B: (( anything )) 

311.19 314.30 A: yep i guess a lot of times when adopted people are 

314.45 319.83 A: you know doing really well in their lives they don't necessarily want to know if if they've overcome some kind of 

319.89 320.95 B: (( handicap )) 

320.75 325.91 A: yeah handicap that their family has you know their birth parents had that you know they don't even know about 

325.98 327.44 B: (( that's right )) 

327.12 328.19 A: yeah 

328.66 329.46 A: yep 

330.15 332.08 A: what what do you think about um 

332.25 334.16 A: lesbian and gay families 

333.97 336.36 B: [mn] i don't believe in them 

335.65 336.56 A: uh-huh 

337.58 341.07 A: so you don't believe that they should be married or they should have children or 

340.87 343.77 B: i don't think they should be married or have children 

343.18 344.63 A: mhm why is that 

344.89 346.20 B: why is that 

345.50 346.42 A: mhm 

347.11 351.31 B: because ah it's not a natural thing 

350.72 351.61 A: uh-huh 

352.54 354.76 B: how can two men have a child how 

354.62 357.35 A: well they obviously can't but they could adopt 

356.50 358.26 B: (( can two women have a child )) 

357.74 358.65 A: yeah 

359.00 362.85 B: and what kind of mo- moral atmosphere would they be living in 

362.12 363.15 A: mhm 

364.01 366.65 B: would they be prone to be gay too 

366.21 367.15 A: mhm 

367.54 370.57 B: maybe that isn't their natural instinct even 

370.13 371.04 A: uh-huh 

371.22 373.30 B: maybe it will be pushed on them 

372.74 373.64 A: maybe 

375.22 389.45 A: yeah i think some people would argue that lots of people whose natural insti- instincts are to be gay or lesbian have you know heterosexuality pushed on them because of the way the society works so it could it could work either way i suppose 

387.15 388.02 B: mhm 

390.73 391.65 A: yeah 

391.35 392.72 B: (( i don't ))

394.92 397.41 B: (( know i have to )) 

399.39 400.36 A: what's that 

402.09 405.58 B: that's probably part of upbringing i guess 

405.12 406.90 A: mhm it can be 

407.11 408.26 B: yeah 

407.67 408.59 A: yeah 

409.55 410.46 A: yeah

474.16 475.24 A: what's that 

475.10 477.66 B: that's pretty hard to do without a father 

477.04 480.16 A: well they would make sure that they would have you know the fr- the male 

480.24 487.26 A: friends of of the mothers would you know come over and hang out and do things with the family um
