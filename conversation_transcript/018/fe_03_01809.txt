0.28 2.66 B: hi this is leanne from indiana 

2.30 7.16 A: hi my name's adam and i am from new york but i'm in virginia right now 

7.30 8.25 B: cool 

7.87 9.29 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

9.03 10.94 B: computers and education 

10.45 12.14 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

11.79 16.02 B: yeah i i really think they help a lot um 

16.31 21.74 B: so considering everything is is um rising the way it is 

20.94 22.33 A: mhm 

21.72 33.26 B: i don't think it is fair sometimes for families that don't have computers that that they require them to you know search the internet for things some just don't have time to take their kids to the library and what have you 

34.36 35.84 A: yeah um 

36.02 42.93 A: i def- definitely agree with that i think that um as a student right now like i'm twenty years old right now and um 

43.28 47.39 A: computers i guess we were sort of like the first generation uh 

47.54 50.70 A: um grow up with them basically and um 

50.98 63.68 A: like i had i was lucky enough because my um parents were teachers to have access to computers at their school from i guess um around first grade or so and like 

63.91 70.83 A: i i think it really makes things a lot easier like if you want to look something up on an encyclopedia and um 

71.02 81.18 A: i mean even like things that you might think are kind of trivial like if if i'm reading something in my text book or whatever and like i'm kind of interested in it i might just go on line and search for it 

79.95 84.09 B: yeah you want to get a little deeper into it you can find just about anything 

81.77 82.83 A: right 

83.72 85.86 A: yeah i think that's pretty cool 

84.11 85.09 B: yeah 

85.18 96.33 B: yeah it opens up a new world it definitely does but uh my eleven year old i'm thirty so by the way you weren't the first one to deal with computers i had them too [laughter] um 

87.56 89.27 A: (( yeah and )) 

94.17 95.20 A: [laughter] 

96.41 104.56 B: my eleven year old she has geography projects every week and um it's really crazy because um a lot of the que- answers are not in the books 

99.44 100.59 A: mhm 

103.95 105.21 A: mhm 

104.58 117.49 B: and you know we've had four or five people you know say where is the uh you know do you know where this answer is can you find this no i can't find it well there are you know my my issue is yeah i can go on line just fine and try and try to find it you know 

117.48 120.18 B: but there's a lot of kids that don't have them 

119.56 120.83 A: (( mhm yes right [cough] )) 

120.30 122.90 B: i think there ought to be some type of program you know 

123.27 128.17 B: for the lesser you know not so fortunate people that have children 

128.21 137.61 B: you know to be able to obtain a computer somehow they are so strict any more about you know your credit and all this to get a computer but yet the schools want you to have them 

137.53 146.72 B: for the knowledge and then you know like the town i live in is a small town and we have eight computers but sometimes that's just not enough if the whole entire grade have a project 

146.34 148.29 A: (( yeah i agree definitely )) 

147.45 153.28 B: not to mention the parents they just sometimes don't have time because they get you know caught up in the rat race 

152.34 154.56 A: mhm yeah i mean 

153.39 154.32 B: but 

154.58 157.97 A: um at at my college here like um 

158.44 159.35 A: it's 

159.37 162.55 A: (( i i go to william and mary dean in lindsborg and like )) 

162.57 176.50 A: i notice like a lot of the emphasis when you're first coming in is you know you pretty much need a computer they'll sometimes they'll they'll be like you don't really need it because there's computer labs and there's computers labs there's like four of them around campus but i mean 

176.82 186.68 A: around times when like a lot of people need to use them it's like you really wish that everyone had access to it because and also some of them aren't as new as other ones and like it makes it difficult 

185.13 186.26 B: yeah 

186.61 193.98 A: and like when the computer is constantly having problems and like closing out of your work when you're like in the middle of it like it's pretty frustrating 

193.26 195.75 B: yikes yeah i guess that would be 

195.17 200.64 A: yeah i mean i've definitely heard stories of that happening to people thankfully i haven't had that yet but 

200.61 204.25 B: yeah like college is not expensive enough and now they want to have a computer too 

203.79 210.88 A: [laughter] yeah um like my parents always told me about how they used to have like a typewriter at college but 

204.41 205.45 B: (( ha )) 

211.04 212.52 A: and like you know 

212.49 224.99 A: it would be so difficult to get things formatted right for their teachers and like their professors would be like coming down on them if they didn't have the margins just right and like when you do that on a typewriter i guess like you need to put the paper in just right 

224.37 226.81 B: yeah yeah 

224.91 233.86 A: and things like that but um i mean like it's so much easier [mn] like basically the the thing i think about it about it's good is like 

234.25 243.54 A: it makes it so much more convenient and just easy to access like you don't have to worry about the trivial things of life setting the page numbers right like it automatically does that for you you know 

238.99 240.01 B: yeah 

243.05 248.57 B: yeah like we we just did a um a science er project a big one and 

248.58 255.82 B: you know it's real nice to have the search engines i mean i really like google a lot because you can basically go type anything you want 

255.44 256.52 A: right 

255.89 267.39 B: and it tells you exactly what you want well here we were doing this project about how to how to make a light bulb and and i'll be darned if i didn't type it into google and there it was exactly how to do it 

261.17 263.28 A: (( mhm )) 

267.06 268.73 A: [laughter] 

267.57 272.65 B: so i was like wow that saved me a lot of trouble i thought it saved me a lot of trouble until we got to the paperwork 

272.29 276.32 A: [laughter] yes that reminds me of um last semester actually 

276.48 288.45 A: i was just about i stayed up all night studying for my chemistry final and i remember my teacher just mentioning it in one class how a light bulb works a fluorescent light bulb and the difference between that and an incandescent light bulb and i was like 

288.48 294.09 A: thinking to myself as i was studying that night that light i bet he'd throw that on the on the test 

294.07 304.27 A: and i was just about to leave and i was grabbing my books as i was going and then i just typed it into google and that like saved me for the test and it gave me like five five points just had the like quick summary there 

300.16 301.51 B: but oh sure 

301.81 302.95 B: yeah 

304.69 316.45 B: yes you can definitely find it and i needed graph paper we nee- my daughter's she's like i said she's eleven and thankfully thankfully it was like the first time we ever did it and she she went all the way you know with firsts but 

313.61 314.57 A: (( yeah )) 

316.13 317.07 A: yeah 

316.34 322.37 B: if it if it hadn't have been for that computer it would never have happened but we found time lines and everything on the computer 

322.28 332.45 B: um but just to run in and see you know run in and you can just find about anything and like with her geography i can go to jeeves and i can type in the question and it will give us the answer 

332.08 333.10 A: yeah 

332.54 344.65 B: but that yeah geography is definitely different 'cause if you didn't have a computer you wouldn't find some of the answers i mean you would absolutely have to go to a library so it definitely benefits it definitely does 

335.55 336.61 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

338.79 339.69 A: yeah 

343.25 350.96 A: yeah it's pretty amazing too 'cause like my cousin is five years old right now and like i'll i'll go over to my uncle's house and like 

351.27 363.65 A: he'll just be sitting on the computer like you know doing things that like i mean my dad is just learning how to use the computer too and i don't know if he could keep up with my five year old cousin because like kids are now being raised with them which i think is 

362.60 364.11 B: yeah yeah 

364.21 367.70 A: it's an interesting like new twist on like learning now 

364.37 365.80 B: yeah 

367.40 377.76 B: i have a friend that just got a computer and and they just got it you know for their son and gosh we've had ours probably six or seven years and i was like dang you know you really need to get that boy a computer 

377.48 378.48 A: (( [laughter] )) 

377.72 386.28 B: but i mean because all the stuff at school they just absolutely have to have it and i have another friend that has five kids and and she is not very well off and they don't have a computer 

379.59 380.56 A: yeah 

385.29 386.91 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

386.31 394.88 B: and i just i don't know i don't think it i mean i agree it's okay you know for their education part but if you want them to have it then you need to make means so they can 

394.71 395.67 A: yeah 

395.07 407.21 B: and you are only allowed like so many in in you know public schools they're only allowed like one day a week to go to computer lab so [laughter] you know [laughter] how do how do you do that with twenty six kids in a class and you've got fifteen computers 

401.41 402.17 A: (( yeah )) 

406.82 408.58 A: yeah uh 

408.78 414.66 A: i don't know it brings up like a whole another issue like government spending which like i think schools need that you know 

412.30 414.63 B: certainly does certainly does 

414.91 420.30 A: um especially being like the son of two teachers like elementary school teachers like i know 

420.35 422.64 A: definitely that like a lot of times 

423.23 428.31 A: you wish that they had stuff but they just don't you know they they deserve more but 

428.35 434.95 A: um and like i don't know the question itself that they gave us today is like it makes me wonder like 

435.36 446.27 A: like i could see how people would say that there are certain things out there like on the internet and things like that that might be detrimental to the kids or it might just that they're fun video games they'll say 

443.56 444.93 B: yeah 

446.21 456.41 A: or like just listening to music or whatever and i mean like there's that but like i think if you find a balance like um like i mean even the 

455.72 458.93 B: sit down and write down the pros and cons basically 

458.10 462.70 A: right and i mean i think the pros definitely outweigh the cons like by far 

460.55 462.06 B: oh yeah 

462.31 471.07 B: yeah they definitely do but you know there's a lot of times [cough] when i've been you know on the internet playing a game or something and the kids at school and i'm like what are you doing 

471.16 472.69 B: (( why are you in here )) 

472.57 473.13 A: (( [cough] )) 

473.29 480.39 B: aren't you suppose- well yeah wait my teacher's coming what's that panic button for you know that's what it's for [laughter] so 

477.64 479.28 A: [laughter] 

480.42 494.01 B: i don't know as far as the education part yeah if the kids just wanted to use it you know it was going to use it strictly for education that's wonderful i think it's it's a plus but then unfortunately you know in the in the high school it doesn't happen 

480.58 481.36 A: yeah 

493.75 503.03 A: yeah i mean it's tough because my high school like two years ago i was graduating and i would go in- into the library on my study hall and just uh go on line 

494.50 495.29 B: so 

503.33 511.04 A: and a lot of times i would be researching something for a paper and like once you have high school topics some of the sometimes the stuff will be like 

511.26 516.47 A: you know it might be violent or something like because you are studying a war and they might have like 

516.88 530.83 A: um like when they're describing like what happened let's say in like world war two or something the soldiers in like vietnam a lot of times those site will be blocked and like i understand the the reasoning behind like keeping kids from going in and like what they shouldn't be 

530.86 536.19 A: but it it's you know i think i guess that problem will solve itself over the years as they refine like 

535.44 536.56 B: i'm sure 

536.22 537.93 A: the whole you know 

537.99 540.64 A: this page isn't right but this one is and it's like 

541.02 550.61 A: sometimes if a a word has like a funny word with an f. that like might not sound appropriate like when when it's like in the context of it it might be okay you know 

546.24 548.03 B: mhm 

550.15 551.08 B: yeah 

550.87 556.55 A: like i don't know that was one thing that kind of like annoyed me but i just i understood it like i it wasn't yeah 

556.10 558.52 B: yeah i think maybe they should have um 

558.52 563.81 B: i mean since it is a public computer maybe they shouldn't lock down all the sites i mean maybe 

563.58 575.56 B: they should um maybe give you a card with the bar code that says you know actually has your identification on it or something your age that way the computer doesn't lock you completely down if you're over you know the age of seventeen or whatever 

575.24 575.99 A: (( ahah )) 

575.89 577.37 B: i mean that's a thought 

577.64 582.21 A: yeah i mean like my parents never really um 

582.81 587.61 A: never really like stopped me from any of that like they they just sort of like let it go 

587.35 592.50 B: yeah they figure if they gave you your wings then you're going do what's right anyway so 

587.72 589.16 A: but i mean like we didn't 

591.08 599.89 A: right i mean like i i never really did anything like that with that but like i mean i know there are people who do so [noise] i can i can understand like why
