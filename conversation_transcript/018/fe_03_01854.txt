0.82 2.56 B: hi this is pam 

1.65 4.17 A: [noise] this is doris 

4.43 5.55 B: hi doris 

5.19 6.17 A: hi 

6.99 10.67 B: so we're gonna talk about computers in education it sounds like 

10.08 16.58 A: and exactly right now i'm on a computer [laughter] [laughter] 

13.16 14.73 B: me too [laughter] 

15.34 16.21 B: so 

16.91 19.72 B: i definitely think it's probably of benefit to have them 

19.80 24.83 A: oh yeah especially everything is ah computers now 

24.37 26.30 B: exactly i mean even 

26.40 32.76 B: you know if you go to a fast food restaurant it's still some type of computer thing that's got everything in it and 

32.74 33.93 A: that's true 

33.70 36.44 B: i think the earlier the kids get to 

36.47 39.06 B: get on it the easier they're going to be able to 

39.19 41.50 B: motivate and go around with it and 

41.46 42.54 A: (( yep )) 

42.47 43.68 B: but um 

44.01 49.61 B: it is kinda about i have some friends that their children are i don't know like maybe in the second or third grade and 

49.68 60.47 B: they already know more than their some of their parents on the computer and if the parent will be stuck on it the kid already knows what to do to get them out or fix it and they're just sitting there kind of like how old are you now 

59.57 68.37 A: [laughter] mine now i have ah from five to sixteen and even the five year old knows how to do 

68.79 70.59 A: pretty much everything 

71.02 75.13 B: well i mean but it it's gonna be so much more helpful i mean 

75.60 76.72 B: especially 

76.79 87.40 B: even at in work related things later on in life i mean so many thing everything's going computer like we talked about earlier so i mean they're gonna i mean to them it's just gonna be second nature 

86.99 89.13 A: mhm 

87.77 91.45 B: i definitely think that's gonna be a plus they're gonna be comfortable with it 

91.32 93.31 A: oh yeah 

92.13 100.56 B: and you know they're not afraid to try it and especially if they learn it in school where everything else is taught they just think that's the way it is and 

94.38 95.43 A: no 

100.31 102.03 A: yep that's true 

100.96 102.86 B: (( it is [laughter] )) 

102.25 104.53 A: it's all computers now 

103.94 105.26 B: oh i know 

106.19 112.22 B: now um in the schools your kids are in do they each i know some schools and i guess maybe bigger areas 

112.44 117.57 B: every child has its own computer and then some of them just have the little um 

118.45 124.67 B: labs or things where they only have so much time and there's so many computers and the kids have to share back and fourth 

124.44 128.96 A: yeah that's how my younger ones are and my older one has his own at school 

128.59 129.72 B: yeah 

129.11 131.08 A: that he goes on when he's 

131.90 135.50 A: (( there )) 

131.90 134.20 B: well i guess they probably 

134.53 139.35 B: one things is they start teaching them and then i guess the better they get along with it they feel 

139.74 141.79 B: they can let them go and 

142.51 146.57 B: be on their own whereas i guess when they're first trying to teach them they just 

142.60 144.52 A: yeah 

146.83 148.51 A: (( mhm )) 

147.31 149.24 B: want to keep an eye on them [laughter] mhm 

148.56 157.50 A: yep and it's always good to you know for your parent the kid's parent to have a computer 'cause i know a lot of times they come home and homework 

157.93 163.65 A: that the teachers you know i think they think everybody has a computer 

163.83 169.46 A: you know and it's always homework that you know they want you to look up stuff on the computer 

170.63 177.10 B: yeah i don't know i've heard a lot of the parents say you know that now book reports are things like that that they want the kids to turn them in 

176.76 177.79 A: mhm 

177.24 184.62 B: from a computer and i'm like you i'm thinking well i know they may and it sometimes appears like that but everybody does not have one 

184.12 186.92 A: no that's what i say you know i 

187.40 191.88 A: like my daughter had a it was a twenty three page report 

191.64 192.81 B: oh my god 

192.02 199.35 A: and i'm like thank god we had a computer 'cause if we didn't you know there was no way i could get all that information 

199.80 209.84 B: oh no if you had to go to a library and sit for hours and look it up on a book and go back and forth just ah the speed of the computer being able to find all that thing makes it 

209.13 209.91 A: (( yep )) 

210.97 212.63 B: so much better but 

212.06 213.43 A: oh yeah 

214.16 216.50 B: but i'd definitely say that it's [sigh] 

217.75 220.30 B: very good to go ahead and start getting them in 

220.86 226.35 B: school and get them on the computers as soon as they can 'cause i think the more familiar they are with them the 

226.53 231.47 B: they won't be like us little bit older people who are just a little bit leary of them and 

231.28 234.17 A: oh yeah 

231.94 240.88 B: my hus- people say well i don't know what button to press and all this and my husband's going well what's the worst thing you can do and then he found out 'cause he pressed a button and lost everything we had 

240.37 252.49 A: i've done that i i deleted everything i had no idea that my first computer i pushed the delete all and i deleted i wiped the whole computer out i learned 

241.36 242.47 B: [laughter] 

248.39 250.11 B: [laughter] 

251.23 254.51 B: and it did just what you said [laughter] 

252.71 255.79 A: (( [laughter] )) 

255.02 267.77 B: and you know i think that's the good thing about the kids because they'll i'm sure they'll do that but there'll be somebody right there to show them what to do if that happens so if it happens they won't be you know it'll just be you know 

263.28 265.46 A: mhm 

267.80 269.68 B: something natural for them 

269.02 274.69 A: yeah and they probably know how to fix it better than what i would [laughter] 

273.16 278.37 B: yeah i think it took my husband [mn] several days to get ours back up 

276.94 279.95 A: (( [laughter] )) 

278.45 288.41 B: but yeah so i think you know the more they can do the better they're gonna be job wise and everything down the line i definitely think the computer's the 

288.42 295.85 A: oh yeah 'cause one day i mean everything's totally gonna be computers everything out there so it you know there's 

292.69 293.58 B: mhm 

295.86 298.64 A: gonna be their advantage to learn now 

299.29 305.35 B: i know and like i said even in school just different topics things they can pull it up on the internet i mean 

305.39 306.85 B: my goodness the 

307.83 313.28 B: information that's readily available at literally the touch of a button if they know how to operate it 

311.49 312.10 A: (( mm )) 

312.46 313.90 A: yep 

315.72 318.07 B: so i agree i think it's a good thing and 

318.26 319.16 B: um 

320.19 325.55 B: i'm hoping they'll do the teachers a little bit better though my husband went to take a computer course 

325.25 326.26 A: (( mhm )) 

325.97 330.80 B: and he knew more than the instructor and i thought that was kinda bad [laughter] 

327.54 328.83 A: [laughter] oh no 

329.72 332.86 A: yeah [laughter] 

331.14 335.86 B: so that's one thing i hope too that they keep the teachers ahead of the students so that 

334.95 336.00 A: (( mhm )) 

336.02 341.41 B: you know 'cause every now and then there's just some of them that are just so sharp they just pick it up and go right away and 

340.56 342.02 A: (( yeah )) 

341.49 347.76 B: and if the teacher doesn't have any more information sometimes i know they'll get a little bored with it and 

347.19 348.24 A: mhm 

348.55 349.70 B: (( but um )) 

349.45 358.85 A: yeah like my sixteen year old they say he has the ability to do the web graphics and web designing you know the web pages 

357.72 359.15 B: mhm 

359.08 362.81 A: and i i told him that's something you should follow i said 

363.16 367.96 A: because it'll be good and and you can make a lot of money from that 

367.86 370.18 B: oh my goodness yes because 

370.50 375.51 B: i mean the for people who don't know how to do that part of it i mean they may know how to use the 

376.00 376.91 B: um 

378.69 383.71 B: that computer but they may not know how to do all that so they're still going to be needing people for that 

380.96 381.97 A: mhm 

383.08 383.88 A: (( yep )) 

383.85 384.96 B: (( and um )) 

386.15 387.70 B: so i think that 

388.74 394.27 B: you're definitely heading him in the right direction and get the training while he's right there in school and you know be 

392.78 393.99 A: yep that's 

394.34 395.69 B: be ready to 

396.24 404.67 B: go job marketing his skills and do some something it sounds like he probably likes if he's already got into that 

404.02 410.72 A: yeah that's what i told him i said even you know you can go i know some restaurants you know they they need the 

411.07 416.46 A: the menus made up like the little chinese restaurants i said you know you 

413.97 415.04 B: mhm 

416.60 420.28 A: you can do that i mean you can go there and they'll give you 

420.29 426.30 A: the list and you know if they like it they'll they'll pay you for it and they'll use it 

427.91 437.19 B: it's true i mean every- almost everybody has got something that they're doing whether it's either a web page or what you're saying the menus for businesses and 

437.61 438.53 B: i mean if 

438.55 440.95 B: they've got the education to go in there 

440.79 441.40 A: (( [cough] )) 

441.04 446.03 B: and do that on a computer i mean there's endless job opportunities i think for them to do 

445.73 448.29 A: yep that's true that it's 

448.42 451.42 A: amazing now [laughter] 

450.81 452.10 B: i agree 

452.47 456.47 A: i i still can't get the i mean i've been on here 

456.85 461.65 A: over five years on the computer and it's just still amazes me 

461.78 467.96 A: how you can do things and how just typing on a computer like in a chat room you know 

468.09 472.87 A: and and they know what you're saying you know it it's just amazing 

470.65 471.64 B: (( [laughter] i know )) 

474.21 477.96 B: i i agree totally just you know how does 

477.98 482.90 B: how all of a sudden i'm typing something in front of me and then it's at your place how does that happen 

481.62 484.33 A: yeah [laughter] 

483.30 489.25 B: and i still don't know how any of that happens and but i i'm doing it anyway [laughter] 

487.96 491.14 A: yep i think that's what makes it you know 

491.70 498.46 A: fun and and addictive a computer's very addicting now [laughter] 

495.82 497.04 B: oh definitely 

497.18 498.29 B: definitely 

498.55 501.16 B: and so hopefully with some of that 

501.39 503.35 B: and that's nothing probably 

503.81 507.45 B: because it really is even after five years it's still so new 

507.12 509.33 A: yeah 

507.66 514.43 B: you know but that's something and with children get it in school and they get it for twelve years or more you know it's just gonna be 

515.00 519.17 B: like any other class they have or any other subject and i think they may 

519.84 521.43 B: not be like that 

521.13 524.13 A: mhm it'll just you know it'll be normal 

523.66 533.09 B: mhm because i'm like you when i get on the computer and i'll find something and that'll lead me to something else and you know you think you're gonna be on there thirty minutes an hour and i look and it's four or five hours later 

532.45 535.44 A: (( yep [laughter] )) 

533.88 541.88 B: um i understand all that exactly and so that's hoping that some of that too will help the kids and you know that the 

541.91 544.49 B: with the education they can 

544.61 548.68 B: instill some of that ability in them so that everything is just not 

548.92 552.68 B: sit down in front of the computer and that's all they do because it'll just be 

553.17 558.34 B: something normal every day hat to them they won't think it's probably as thrilling as we are after 

558.54 560.18 B: a little while but 

559.70 560.75 A: (( mhm )) 

560.65 562.27 B: but i agree it's 

562.93 564.90 B: (( it's absolutely amazing )) 

565.03 566.67 B: and then the fact that they've 

566.07 573.88 A: yeah oh yeah [laughter] that's what i have 

566.71 570.93 B: got now that you can be on your phone line and be on your computer at the same time and 

571.10 572.00 B: (( it's just )) 

573.34 579.11 B: yeah we finally had to go to that because it was either that or get another phone line and it was no that won't work 

578.57 582.06 A: no it's a you it evens out you know 

582.07 586.00 A: 'cause you would have to pay another phone line so it all evens out 

585.67 587.02 B: oh yeah 

586.43 588.22 A: in the end anyway 

588.11 589.13 B: i agree 

589.41 590.44 B: and ah 

591.13 595.82 B: then of course i figured the more people that do get training on the computers you know it's 

596.36 599.89 B: all of those prices are gonna go down maybe eventually everybody will have one in
