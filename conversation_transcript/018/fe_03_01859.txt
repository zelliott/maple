14.94 21.96 A: well kinda i didn't get any feedback so i don't know but i guess we're supposed to be discussing computers in 

22.23 26.49 A: well yeah computers in education if it helps or if it's harmful 

26.98 29.02 B: if it's helpful or harmful 

29.24 30.68 A: yeah 

30.32 32.67 B: i would definitely say helpful what do you think 

32.30 34.47 A: oh i would definitely say helpful too 

34.60 36.18 A: most definitely 'cause 

36.40 49.13 A: i don't know how unless it's kind of a dumb question i think [laughter] because i don't know how it could really be harmful because our society is run by computer i mean you know we have computers in everything now everything's computerized 

39.72 40.92 B: [laughter] 

49.54 59.43 A: so i don't you know if you don't have education then you're not going to understand how to do that and um i don't see how education about computers could be harmful 

59.48 73.19 B: i guess it could be harmful in one way if you start them too young like i know um when i went through most of my college years i typed my papers so i had to actually know how to spell i had to actually [laughter] know how to do the punctuation 

67.15 68.01 A: mhm 

68.78 69.69 A: right 

71.85 73.20 A: oh 

73.09 85.54 B: and see now days it's starting even in fourth grade some schools have them actually handing in you know they can use the word processors they're using computers and the spell check is checking it for them and 

85.38 91.33 B: they even have you know so many of them that show you your proper punctuation you know and so forth 

90.28 101.90 A: that's a good idea i hadn't even thought about excuse me [mn] sorry about that i hadn't even thought about that i was thinking how could it be harmful but yeah you're right 'cause it oh [mn] sorry i had another sneeze there 

101.48 102.56 B: [laughter] that's okay 

102.15 104.13 A: um it's allergies you

105.24 105.99 A: [mn] 

106.20 108.49 A: goodness it's allergies anyway 

108.64 114.07 A: um i didn't i hadn't really thought about how it could be harmful but yeah you're right it takes all the work out of it 

114.21 119.13 A: for them i have um preschoolers and they have a computer in their classroom 

118.82 120.07 B: mhm 

119.45 124.10 A: now i'm sure they don't they don't they don't use any kind of um you know word processing 

124.15 138.85 A: any kind of you know processing um software but they um they play on the computer they have two computers and they're on it regularly and my children know how to control a mouse and stuff and that's not from learning at home 'cause i'm really careful and i don't like them on the computer 

138.89 146.54 A: because they can mess about but they but when i occasionally let them play a toddler game or something they already know how to control the mouse and how to click and stuff 

146.55 150.30 A: which is amazing 'cause they've learned that in in pre ki- preschool 

150.54 157.48 B: well i have to say even that we 'cause we live in such a ah computer age and they see it all around and even the video games and stuff 

150.70 151.65 A: you know and just 

157.23 158.22 A: mhm 

157.54 160.69 B: my son is thirteen and i home school my children 

160.72 161.82 A: oh okay 

160.76 167.91 B: i don't know i don't know a lot about computers that's something that i i'm actually planning to send him for some computer courses 

167.71 168.49 A: uh-huh 

167.93 175.11 B: but just over the years just having the computer in the home and and just little bit that we've taught him that he's picked up from here and there 

175.18 176.79 B: um he's amazing 

176.96 180.82 B: what he figures out himself so i guess sometimes um 

178.99 179.97 A: yeah 

180.87 184.83 B: you know it causes them to think more makes them a little bit more um 

183.05 184.12 A: right

190.57 191.86 B: yeah [laughter] 

198.17 209.17 A: when we we learned we did everything by hand and you know we didn't have we didn't even use calculators you know really it was a treat to use calculators and now they're required to have a calculator in math class 

205.12 205.93 B: right 

209.48 211.11 B: (( yeah )) 

209.62 213.30 A: or at least mine is see mine go to public school i've got um 

213.47 222.25 A: i've got twins that are in preschool and then i've got a um sixteen year old who just turned sixteen he's in tenth grade and so he's had a lot of computer classes um 

222.48 224.33 A: he's had computer um 

224.69 239.25 A: oh computer applications and all that stuff and he knows the um powerpoint and the just regular basic classes in high school you know junior high and high school so he's been doing powerpoint for two years excel 

233.54 234.68 B: mhm 

239.55 244.81 A: um you know m._s. word um publisher i mean he can devise a web site 

245.14 255.00 A: he devised two web sites it's been almost two years since he did that so and knows enough to help and that's not even really taking any special classes that's just what they basically teach them 

254.73 255.66 B: right 

255.38 258.09 A: you know it's amazing what they learn um 

258.13 259.45 A: i know that 

259.59 272.11 A: my my um library here where i live um they offer free classes you might think that's something you'd think about was for your kids but um i live in tulsa which is you know a big city and so pretty good size and

287.75 288.67 A: um 

288.81 293.84 A: through our library free you know as a service and stuff and i've been taking some classes through that 

294.00 296.47 A: because i've been self taught and i'm just 

296.66 298.69 A: you know when i use my um 

298.58 302.01 A: software at work my um word processing software 

301.86 313.92 A: i do everything the long way you know like when i go on to do edit or whatever i copy and paste and that kind of thing i did it the long way instead of easily clicking on the icons and doing it the way they actually teach you in school 

313.75 314.82 B: right 

314.46 316.09 A: so anyway 

315.90 322.83 B: yeah i know i need to learn more my husband had um had you know was actually went to some 

322.92 325.80 B: of those crash courses where you go for two days 

325.71 326.55 A: uh-huh 

326.03 340.58 B: and um and he learned quite a bit and taught us some but um i need i need to really better myself as far as computers especially for teaching the kids but i live here i live in chicago so we do have a lot of resources available but we're kind of waiting to the summer before we um 

334.17 335.72 A: right exactly 

338.25 339.42 A: (( oh that's good )) 

340.78 343.64 B: stick on anything like that so we're just working on the 

343.77 348.68 B: general academics right now and um although we i do use my computer 

345.69 346.38 A: (( right )) 

348.74 350.09 B: in my home schooling 

350.21 352.06 B: i have a phonics program 

352.19 358.02 B: because i have um all the different ages i have a i have a two year old and then i have a 

358.75 366.39 B: one that's seven and she's in second grade and then my um nine year old is in fourth grade and my son is thirteen and he's in seventh 

366.19 369.63 A: yep oh you have three that you're home schooling is that right 

366.57 367.75 B: and so 

368.59 380.37 B: right [laughter] so that when i'm when i'm working with one or using this one i use my computer as a very helpful resource because i have like a phonics program and my seven year old will sit on there and she'll do her phonics 

369.91 371.00 A: wow 

371.37 372.76 A: [mn] 

380.39 385.94 B: with the computer for a while you know and we have um a writing program a creative writing program 

381.98 382.93 A: right 

385.79 386.64 A: mhm 

385.97 390.79 B: and like my seventh grader he's a boy and he's not as 

391.28 398.48 B: you know girls can talk for hours and they can write papers that you have to cut in half because they [laughter] put so much in them you know too many details 

397.49 398.42 A: right 

398.46 408.71 B: boys you know i tell him it's like give me the instant replay like you do at your baseball games you know [laughter] because that's the only time he can give you word for word you know and every little detail 

403.97 404.87 A: mhm 

408.76 412.58 B: but i have a creative writing program that they use on the um 

412.64 425.44 B: to reading rabbit they use on the computer and he really enjoys that and so that's been real helpful to me 'cause it's not like pulling teeth to get him to write something if i tell him to go turn on the computer and do the reading rabbit 

424.47 431.60 A: right right well you know another program um they have that teaches you all the different i don't know are you very familiar with the word the um 

431.82 438.62 A: the word processing software like wordperfect and m._s. office you are familiar with all those 

435.55 436.80 B: mhm 

437.95 439.30 B: yes yes 

438.82 448.42 A: oh okay i was gonna say they have those um those oh computer professor ones that you can do at home and they're really really cool it's just like being in a classroom 

444.16 445.12 B: mhm 

448.99 452.13 A: and um they teach you all that kind of stuff too but 

452.45 453.47 A: anyway 

453.25 456.75 B: i know another way that the computer [laughter] actually is helpful is um 

456.86 459.23 B: i don't keep encyclopedias any longer 

459.33 460.84 A: oh yeah 

459.64 467.46 B: um we use the competence encyclopedia on the c._d. rom and we also do internet ah searches for some of our stuff 

467.48 469.51 B: so that we don't have to have you know 

469.64 472.02 B: two shelves of big heavy books [laughter] 

471.71 474.43 A: right well you're really knowledgeable about this stuff because my 

474.57 483.02 A: i guess i just forget that you know 'cause mine go to public school and i work all day and i just forget about how much they learn they learn so much in school 

483.42 486.33 A: that um but i'm not teaching them 

486.76 488.80 A: you know so wow 

488.99 490.12 A: i didn't i hadn't 

490.71 491.61 A: um 

491.82 493.26 A: that part of it 

493.65 496.86 B: yeah i just i feel sometimes though that you know because 

497.00 502.04 B: i lack as far as like i don't even type properly you know i've never had proper 

502.07 509.24 B: you know courses in that and so that is the next step i want to get my son especially i guess i should start the girls too so that they don't grow up with 

509.34 518.25 B: you know hunting and pecking you know [laughter] i'm gonna get them um you know some type of software probably in the fall that will actually teach them 

511.88 513.23 A: right 

518.25 519.21 A: right 

518.51 526.97 B: you know proper positioning for the keyboarding and stuff and um so that they can be faster and so forth because i do lack in that area you know 

523.85 524.76 A: right 

527.41 528.45 B: and 

527.76 530.44 A: yeah well that that um 

530.77 538.71 A: the library classes you'd be surprised there were a lot of kids in that i mean not little kids but there were a lot of um ten i mean about half the class was um 

538.71 541.50 A: well maybe not half maybe a third of the class was like ten 

541.45 548.86 A: year old eleven year old twelve thirteen all in that age group and then you had a lot of older really really older people 

548.78 557.48 A: like you know my grandparents' age um that were you know having to learn computers because they were having to go back out in the workforce maybe either they've been out of the workforce for a long time 

557.27 558.30 B: mhm 

557.71 563.19 A: um and so they knew how important it was to you know be educated as far as computers go 

563.45 574.40 A: and i just think that you know you you kinda take it for granted because i watch them sit down at the computer and start kinda working at it and there they don't know what to do they really don't they don't some of them don't even know how to turn it on 

573.98 575.45 B: right [laughter] 

574.66 579.22 A: you know and so you just forget you know like 'cause i just you know i work with mine all day long 

579.77 591.48 A: i just you know i forget you know they how how it comes so easily to me but other people sit down and they're having to really totally learn this to you know to get a job because you can't get a job if you don't know computer skills 

591.64 599.37 A: you know i mean depending on what the work is but if you're trying to go for well any kind of administrative kind of job of course but if you're basically anything 

597.25 598.24 B: right
