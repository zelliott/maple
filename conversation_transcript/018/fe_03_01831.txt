0.01 1.12 A: hello 

0.11 1.19 B: hi 

1.35 3.12 B: my name is margaret green 

2.88 4.88 A: hi i'm michelle bracket 

4.46 5.89 B: hi michelle 

5.49 6.71 A: [mn] how are you 

6.25 7.53 B: okay 

7.10 7.82 A: [mn] 

7.76 10.88 B: um the topic is education is that correct 

10.44 13.58 A: ahah i've n- this is the first time i've done this so 

12.60 19.29 B: me too [laughter] well it's about computers whether they help or hurt education 

13.76 16.25 A: oh okay [laughter] [mn] 

18.89 19.92 A: mhm 

19.77 22.33 B: but i think they help tremendously 

22.30 35.09 A: yeah i do too i think that um i think that it's important that they learn to do things without computers but also to do things with them because i mean you can't find a job unless you have that kind of skill 

28.40 29.30 B: mhm 

35.07 36.23 B: that's right 

36.55 39.33 B: and it also teaches you to how research 

39.44 43.90 B: there is so many ah um search engines you know goggle yahoo 

43.78 49.82 A: it makes it so much easier because when i had to do research and do it at had library it takes so much longer 

43.91 44.69 B: (( ah )) 

49.36 50.44 B: oh sure 

49.89 54.23 A: you don't want to do it and you don't have as much access 

53.93 54.85 B: right 

55.22 56.57 A: [lipsmack] so yeah i think it 

56.62 58.78 A: i think it helps a lot [noise] [noise] 

58.11 64.08 B: i think it helps i i think it helps a lot it's helped me greatly when i was going to college ah 

64.01 75.31 B: and afterwards and i work on a computer all day long at work and i know that it helps me and um my grandchildren use computers to research to um 

75.83 83.02 B: ah just to you know [mn] pull down files anything that will assist them in their ah homework 

83.03 89.85 B: and ah you know to it's just i think it's great i really think it helps education i can't see it harming in any way 

90.35 96.10 A: yeah the only the only problem i had is when i was in college [mn] i was an education major 

93.91 94.56 B: (( ahah )) 

95.87 96.72 B: (( ahah )) 

96.36 97.54 A: and the only 

97.57 99.15 A: drawback is 

99.65 114.21 A: people who don't have the money to buy computers because i put myself through college [noise] and i didn't have the money to buy a computer and so it was kinda i was kinda behind everybody else because i didn't have all the recourses and i mean that is one thing in college but it's different 

101.73 102.63 B: right 

104.21 105.25 B: mhm 

105.40 106.37 B: right 

107.80 108.79 B: right 

114.03 114.83 B: (( ahah )) 

114.44 117.38 A: like when you are at a level where you're younger 

117.06 118.04 B: right 

117.43 129.21 A: and so i think that's the only drawback and there needs to be some kind of way to be able to help people who can't buy computers to be able to buy them so that they're not that much further behind because the longer 

129.42 134.30 A: the later you wait to start using it that mu- you're that much farther behind and they're so expensive 

134.22 142.32 B: right fortunately there are libraries you know at least out here in miami there's enough libraries that you can go to and access a computer if you don't have one 

141.69 143.15 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

142.51 149.08 B: and there are other um agencies that have computer labs available to you what state are you in 

148.73 150.43 A: i'm in indiana 

149.82 152.85 B: indiana okay here i'm in miami florida 

150.50 151.39 A: mhm 

152.38 155.51 A: (( oh yeah i've been there [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

153.44 156.56 B: [laughter] and um 

156.82 171.66 B: you know there's a lot of resources so that if you don't have one and now in school they are supplying governor bush is supplying ah public schools with computers so the children learning at an early age how to use the computer 

171.67 174.13 A: [noise] [noise] are they do you have trouble um 

174.04 188.06 A: see that's the funny thing because like i have a friend who lives in miami now she just moved there not too long ago and she tries to go to the library to use the computers so that she can check her email and stuff because you have to pay like a certain amount of money to go to the cyber cafes 

179.12 180.06 B: (( mhm )) 

181.91 182.71 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

187.95 193.87 A: and she doesn't want to do that and pay every single time because she doesn't have the money to buy a computer yet cause she just moved 

193.42 196.09 B: well yeah where is she at because the 

196.38 198.83 B: library is free 

198.29 204.98 A: [mn] yeah it's free but she says has to wait a really long time to get on because there's there's always a big long waiting list 

201.71 202.66 B: oh 

204.38 208.95 B: well what she should do is find out the schedule and find out when is the um 

208.99 213.20 B: you know what hours are are they utilized the least 

212.93 214.08 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

213.41 220.40 B: and then perhaps she can use them on what days whether it's weekdays they're heaviest or you know she's going to have to find out from b- 

220.50 230.55 B: or from another library what are the heaviest traffic hours for those computers so that she can ah you know try to work around that and possibly get in there and ah 

230.60 234.68 B: you know hand held um you know the phones 

234.73 237.13 B: ah do you have a um 

237.18 238.36 B: cell phone 

238.09 239.27 A: (( ahah yeah )) 

238.85 247.87 B: yeah well now they have cell phones where you can just access your you know your computer from you know get your emails and everything and just you know 

247.99 249.70 A: [noise] [noise] she thought about doing that 

249.32 250.16 B: (( ahah )) 

249.85 255.75 A: but like in the case of students like if they had a waiting list shouldn't should they have like 

255.78 258.45 A: they should be allowed to go and get on right away 

258.59 261.76 B: well sure but i don't know how where she's going 

259.48 260.48 A: yeah 

261.92 262.81 B: and 

261.96 264.41 A: i don't know she lives in south beach [mn] 

263.55 268.36 B: is she doing research for a for a ah project for school or 

268.04 280.40 A: no like at her case she's just going to check her emails and stuff but like if she were a student that would be a big problem you know like if you had like a lot of homework to do or something and you went to the library and there was like an hour and a half waiting list 

274.32 275.18 B: mhm 

280.41 281.48 A: you know [mn] 

281.48 293.91 B: well my grand daughter uses computers in schools but she also goes to the library and she doesn't have a problem so south beach is a pretty if she is going to south beach see there's a lot of tourists 

293.62 295.38 A: (( [noise] yeah and i'm sure they're all )) 

297.77 301.75 A: ((  )) 

297.85 298.75 B: (( there ))

333.27 335.42 A: [noise] oh no yeah [noise] 

333.29 348.04 B: you know for her purpose she needs to ah look at that and ah also look at the papers because there is always people selling computers a neighbor neighbors a newspaper that's for children also ah a- accessing and then there's ah 

346.74 347.55 A: (( oh yeah and they )) 

347.97 352.56 B: all these so many then there's the computer show that comes into town once a month

412.37 413.56 A: oh yeah 

412.74 417.26 B: every household should have a computer i think it's that important for um 

417.48 419.90 B: you know children and and students 

419.88 421.02 A: yeah 

420.42 421.62 B: yeah

435.76 436.99 B: yeah 

436.49 442.86 A: so yeah if there is a place that would give them away and i think that's the the same in the case of students like especially 

442.68 449.03 A: like i know when i was in college like because i paid for college it was so hard like buying a computer was not possible 

444.58 445.46 B: mhm 

448.84 462.08 A: cause i mean i had trouble buying food you know [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] when you're worried about what you're going to eat [laughter] the last thing you can think about is buying a computer even though it would have helped me so much you know 

451.09 452.79 B: [laughter] 

453.00 454.77 B: i remember those days [laughter] 

455.89 457.35 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] )) 

460.15 461.26 B: mhm 

461.39 462.25 B: right 

462.75 464.50 B: i just think it's ah 

464.68 468.12 B: it it's just you know it's 

468.57 477.07 B: ah it's ah i should th- think it's one of the top priorities that a student should have on their mind [mn] you know on their list to obtain a computer 

476.75 477.68 A: yeah 

477.31 488.39 B: and and really there is so many resources she's new to miami but if you like i can give you my number and she can call me and i'll try to help her locate a computer 

487.93 491.07 A: that's so nice of you what's your name [noise] 

489.25 490.61 B: mhm 

490.76 492.58 B: my name is margaret green

500.04 501.56 B: nine four seven 

501.58 502.30 A: (( ahah )) 

502.07 503.74 B: four nine eight seven

506.38 510.56 A: i'll tell her that [noise] oh that's so nice thank you very much 

509.25 511.26 B: yeah and what's her name 

510.92 512.38 A: her name is amanda 

512.13 513.21 B: amanda 

512.67 513.92 A: amanda major 

513.36 522.32 B: okay yeah and and and getting back to education on as far as ah i think it's a positive move i think it's necessary 

522.32 533.90 B: to have a computer and i think children really ah benefit by learning how to use a computer in fact i read an article not too long ago that it stimulates their thinking like computer games 

525.82 527.00 A: (( [noise] [mn] yeah and it and it helps them )) 

533.65 535.34 A: ((  )) 

538.46 542.71 B: with their homework actually when they get into study it helps them think clearer 

542.32 548.04 A: ah [noise] [noise] oh and i think you're behind if you don't have that experience like because then when you 

546.21 547.16 B: right 

548.41 560.24 A: when you go up into the higher grades and people already know how to use them it puts you that much further behind i think it would be great if like because you know schools recyc- or schools buy new computers on a pretty regular basis i 

551.41 552.87 B: mhm 

559.59 560.75 B: mhm 

560.46 574.28 A: i sell computers and like all my clients are schools and government agencies and they have like budgets to buy new systems every certain amount of time they have to budget it out so like sometimes they have systems that 

561.73 562.66 B: mhm 

565.06 566.04 B: mhm 

567.17 568.12 B: (( ahah )) 

569.91 570.86 B: right 

574.39 585.48 A: you know they're going to replace that aren't even broken yet and i think it would be great if the schools started like giving those systems to students or you know or people who needed them 

576.57 577.91 B: (( mhm )) 

583.64 584.61 B: what 

584.65 585.80 B: exactly 

586.22 588.88 B: exactly i know they give to the handicapped 

588.79 590.10 A: mhm 

589.22 591.53 B: you know but they should extend that 

591.20 592.71 A: yeah they should 

591.58 595.90 B: i'm i'm pretty sure that there because i know that they give away computers 

596.03 599.89 B: you know like i say they're not the latest model they don't have may not have
