81.82 85.00 A: um at a university for freshmen 

84.67 85.81 B: mhm 

85.57 88.35 A: and we use computers in the classroom once a week 

88.30 89.20 B: oh 

89.02 91.65 A: we meet in a computer lab um 

91.78 94.01 A: so it's a really interesting topic for me [laughter] 

93.57 99.22 B: yeah i really i you know i i believe in it i really do because there's a lot 

99.44 102.76 B: that needs to be done on a computer anymore 

102.79 109.09 A: yeah well all of our i mean even in high school i think when i was in high school most of my assignments had to be typed 

108.83 110.22 B: mhm 

109.43 110.74 A: and it was 

110.88 117.31 A: when i was finishing high school i think it was right at the turn of when people were really starting to use computers instead of 

117.48 120.62 A: using a word processor or a typewriter 

120.27 122.35 B: right so how old are you 

121.09 123.81 A: so i know that that's what i do how old am i 

123.29 124.50 B: yeah 

123.90 125.09 A: twenty five 

124.99 129.05 B: see i'm twenty nine so i'm i'm just behind you 

126.58 127.40 A: okay 

128.83 132.07 A: just passed that did you use them in high school at all that 

131.44 133.89 B: um very little 

132.57 133.66 A: you remember 

133.78 134.79 A: yeah 

134.79 146.09 B: it was it was all d._o._s. when i was in high school so it was really hard to understand [laughter] yeah yeah even at even i took a um 

137.39 138.30 A: okay 

138.56 140.03 A: okay [laughter] 

141.09 142.72 A: the old programs 

146.17 147.77 B: microcomputers 

147.84 152.08 B: ah thing in college and even that was a lot of that was d._o._s. 

149.69 150.60 A: uh-huh 

152.50 154.94 A: and a lot of like programing language 

154.47 155.65 B: mhm 

155.02 156.26 A: did you have that 

155.85 156.89 B: yeah 

156.91 162.88 B: and it was it was hard it was hard to understand now everything's spelled out 

160.47 162.05 A: that would be yeah 

163.13 167.57 A: that would be really hard for me i mean the classes that i've had to take 

167.67 173.64 A: about computers have mostly been research based like how to do research on the internet 

170.94 171.82 B: mhm 

172.26 173.13 B: yeah 

173.75 178.86 A: and i think that is an incredible skill because even if you go out and work 

178.98 183.10 A: at some point i think lots of people especially in like an office environment 

183.12 184.13 B: mhm 

183.50 187.72 A: you have to go on line or people go on line for fun it's like use a._o._l. 

187.59 188.51 B: yeah 

187.88 192.83 A: or whatever to go on line and i think if you you can't not know how to do that now 

192.66 194.19 B: no you can't 

193.09 194.61 A: you have to know 

194.59 199.84 B: see even i work at the v._a. hospital and even there there's there's um 

199.94 204.98 B: we have to have forty hours of education in to get our pay raises 

205.02 208.13 B: and even even that is all on the internet now 

205.21 206.15 A: (( [laughter] really )) 

208.72 211.40 A: oh my gosh you have to take on line classes 

209.10 210.40 B: (( it's yeah it's )) 

211.47 217.87 B: not classes you go in and there's like um education tutorials that are mandatory 

217.77 218.72 A: okay 

218.21 223.60 B: and we have our own government code and everything that we have to put in but that's all over the internet 

223.78 225.09 A: is it interesting 

225.11 225.96 B: no 

225.48 229.80 A: or is it no [laughter] [laughter] 

226.69 237.54 B: it's all refresher it's stuff i've i i do every day and i learn every day and it's pretty much you know you flip through it and then you take the quiz at the end and you pass it and you get your 

236.27 238.05 A: and that's it you're just done 

237.75 247.84 B: yeah you get your hour of of however much time and education that you spent but you only probably spent five minutes of it 'cause it's all everyday things 

243.04 244.11 A: okay 

247.64 248.59 A: okay 

248.21 254.59 B: but it's all over the internet and i mean there was people they had to had to ask what a mouse was 

254.45 255.61 A: really 

255.04 256.68 B: oh yeah yeah 

256.17 260.46 A: that's i'd i i mean for me that's totally foreign because 

260.85 266.39 A: we used computers starting in high school really and then in college 

266.89 268.25 A: they were everywhere 

268.52 269.49 A: um 

269.75 274.27 A: you know each dorm had a computer lab and if you didn't know how to use it 

273.70 274.99 B: mhm 

274.31 279.64 A: i i did have a few friends in college who refused to use email because they didn't know how 

280.34 283.01 A: and they didn't really want to because they didn't know how 

282.85 283.81 B: right 

283.61 284.43 A: but 

285.01 288.00 A: it was pretty much mandatory and i don't know how 

288.92 294.23 A: you could get by now without having any knowledge of it if you're under the age of thirty 

294.06 297.63 B: yeah and see that's that's a lot of stuff even banking 

298.29 305.33 B: i i can do more i don't ever have to go to my bank because either over the phone or over the internet i can do whatever i need [laughter] 

305.26 308.30 A: i know especially with kids it's really nice [laughter] 

307.57 309.25 B: yeah yeah 

308.51 311.02 A: because i don't have to run out all the time 

310.68 312.15 B: exactly 

312.48 319.02 B: i mean the drive throughs are nice but it's i can transfer money i can apply for loans i can do whatever i need to 

318.34 319.23 A: yeah 

319.28 324.09 B: right on the internet which is kinda scary because anybody can get the number but 

323.69 324.96 A: i i know 

324.88 331.72 B: it you know it everything i can pay my bills i don't actually ever have to leave the house [laughter] 

328.74 329.53 A: yeah 

331.47 335.29 A: [laughter] yeah shopping you can have peapod deliver groceries 

334.86 338.05 B: yep exactly well no not here 

335.90 336.87 A: (( that's funny )) 

338.06 338.97 A: okay 

338.46 341.53 B: my my town's like ten thousand [laughter] 

340.96 344.59 A: okay are you outside of are you north of milwaukee 

344.96 348.29 B: um yes do you know where wisconsin dolls is 

348.44 349.35 A: yeah 

349.08 351.98 B: um probably about an hour past there 

351.89 352.80 A: okay 

352.47 356.74 B: about forty five minutes i'm right in between wisconsin dolls and lacrosse 

357.02 359.65 A: okay we go up to egg harbor sometimes 

359.75 361.72 B: i have no clue where that is 

361.28 363.05 A: it's up in um 

364.53 365.69 A: um 

366.01 367.49 A: like the peninsula 

367.49 369.26 B: oh the u._p. 

369.50 372.41 A: almost all the way up there but in like that um 

373.44 374.75 A: what's it called 

375.51 378.67 A: oh i can't remember it's just northern wisconsin 

378.28 385.26 B: yeah see i'm south i'm i'm like by ah i'm heading towards o'claire like over towards minnesota 

384.71 386.00 A: oh okay 

385.47 387.17 B: towards the cities 

387.06 387.91 A: okay 

387.88 391.37 B: i'm i'm like four hours from chicago 

391.67 400.77 B: it takes me about i have a friend that lives in schamberg and it takes me probably four hours to get there and about two and a half to get to minneapolis so i'm like 

400.21 401.11 A: okay 

401.23 402.55 A: that's not bad 

401.97 404.73 B: yeah no it's not you know i'm kinda 

404.86 408.55 B: right in the middle but the town i live in is real real small so 

407.90 408.79 A: well 

409.16 410.81 B: there is huh 

409.35 410.12 A: you 

410.91 415.40 A: do you think that makes a difference i mean i live in i don't know if you know of naperville 

415.76 416.82 B: (( no )) 

415.94 421.12 A: but it's another suburb of chicago and it's really there are a hundred and thirty thousand i think 

420.79 422.13 B: really 

421.53 426.36 A: i think it's the second biggest city in illinois but all the schools have computers 

426.51 429.38 A: like state of the art computer labs 

429.79 434.04 A: the elementary schools and junior highs but i think it's because it's a huge city 

433.92 435.41 B: mhm 

434.82 439.89 A: and they have to and they have a lot of people contributing to the school board's budget 

439.31 440.36 B: yeah 

439.90 441.99 A: so everybody has to learn how to use it 

442.24 445.53 A: i'm even jealous of my students i teach freshmen 

445.79 449.37 A: and i'm teaching this semester how to write a research paper 

449.15 450.42 B: really 

450.12 460.30 A: and i wish i had done i [laughter] had had this class when i was a freshman in college because it teaches them how to do um internet research across the board 

454.27 455.15 B: uh-huh 

460.37 461.38 A: um 

461.58 467.29 A: and on how to manipulate like word to do charts and to do 

467.38 468.45 A: um 

469.30 476.63 A: tables and things that i didn't learn until i was a graduate student because i was never forced to learn how to do it 

473.63 474.33 B: (( see )) 

476.02 479.42 B: right now see none of that stuff is familiar with me 

479.38 480.20 A: yeah 

479.50 483.52 B: i can do the as much research as i need to 

483.48 484.34 A: right 

483.97 486.17 B: but that's about where it stops 

486.14 488.50 A: but do you need to do more i mean do you 

488.82 493.87 B: um right at the very moment no because i'm not i'm not back in school 

489.14 489.77 A: i 

493.73 494.63 A: right 

494.17 497.67 B: so i really don't have to but um 

498.02 505.40 B: if i were to go back to school again yeah i i would have to but my my aunt is actually a a 

500.98 502.06 A: yeah 

505.51 508.25 B: english professor at t._c. 

508.89 513.90 B: so if i need any help with that kind of thing then she's here to help me but 

511.41 512.44 A: okay 

513.46 514.65 A: that's nice 

514.37 519.66 B: as far as like me for research it's all what i want to look up and what i 

520.09 523.04 B: you know i don't really have to look anything up 

522.97 523.88 A: right 

523.38 534.36 B: it's more for everyday living and and but as far as education goes yeah by the time my daughter gets in high school it's probably there's not going to be anything they don't do on computer 

534.57 539.72 A: i the only thing as a teacher that i see that's ne- really negative about computer use 

540.09 542.95 A: is that people cannot spell [laughter] 

542.97 544.36 B: can't spell 

543.30 544.79 A: because everybody uses 

544.83 549.23 A: can't spell because everybody uses spell check because everything they turn in 

549.20 550.29 B: [laughter] 

549.39 552.73 A: has to be typed so they just spell check everything 

552.57 554.61 B: i never thought about that 

554.21 560.47 A: so they don't even think about how to spell things it doesn't matter if they put them in wrong because they think spell check will catch it 

560.63 564.82 A: sometimes it does but sometimes it gives them the wrong word like 

564.00 565.51 B: yeah 

564.84 568.72 A: t. h. e. i. r. instead of t. h. e. r. e. 

569.38 570.42 A: um 

570.50 573.02 A: and so i see a lot more of those issues 

572.71 574.19 B: yeah 

573.56 575.76 A: than i think you would otherwise because 

576.35 584.72 A: i think before you had to have somebody spell check your paper manually [laughter] there's no like machine to do it for you and so people i think are really lazy about it 

580.21 581.13 B: yeah 

584.54 588.21 B: do you get do you get like a lot of people not sound like 

588.47 595.08 B: themselves like do you do creative writing or anything like that or is it all research based 

594.79 599.89 A: this particular class is research paper but the other course in the sequence this is like the first
