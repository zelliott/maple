8.15 10.60 A: [noise] um [laughter] 

8.70 17.03 B: well okay so the topic is computers how do they enrich our lives i would have to say well right now i'm sitting here in front of my laptop 

17.04 23.94 B: and ah it's become extremely helpful to me [noise] i'm a college student so i have to use computers 

24.16 29.93 B: ah almost every night either to type a paper or to do research on the internet 

30.01 33.65 B: or ah a lot of my professors have gotten to the point where 

33.89 40.46 B: [mn] they like to communicate frequently to me by email and i i go to the university of tennessee knoxville 

40.47 50.59 B: and they the university has an online system where professors can post assignments and quizzes and you can look up your grades and they have discussion boards running 

50.68 60.97 B: so in a way computers have become pretty integral in my education and ah i i feel comfortable using computers i grew up using computers so 

60.99 65.14 B: i have to say i i like them i think they've enriched my life pretty good 

64.79 67.20 A: [mn] [mn] oh i have um 

67.31 68.66 A: [noise] do you hear an echo 

68.45 69.94 B: no [noise] i'm fine 

69.65 77.59 A: [mn] okay i have the same kind of experience i'm a graduate student in massachusetts um and 

78.05 88.28 A: not only do i use my computer you know for all of my assignments and to communicate with my professors i also use it for research [mn] our library has 

88.25 97.78 A: um online data bases so i don't e- even have to go to the library most of the time now to get the articles that i need um for research 

98.46 105.30 A: and i use it for communication with my friends too [mn] back in virginia so 

105.49 106.56 A: um 

107.07 109.43 A: more than just my education it's 

109.59 110.71 A: (( a )) 

111.19 113.41 A: vehicle for communication 

113.75 120.94 B: yeah i work with um i work at the federal court house here too while ah i'm not in classes 

121.27 131.89 B: and [lipsmack] sometimes i look at old files and i can see where they've typed where they've had to use a typewriter and type things in and they they sometimes some of my bosses and 

131.94 136.80 B: other people that um i work with who are older than me tell me about how they 

136.77 150.71 B: used to have to use type with a computer um typewriters all the time and how they like using computers so much in fact there are computers in the court rooms today so a lot of times the 

150.89 155.13 B: people that go into the court rooms with the judges will 

155.13 166.81 B: be doing other tasks on their computers while the judge is listening to a case so i guess in that way it allow them to be more efficient um how they work so [noise] 

163.95 165.23 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

166.33 172.21 A: yeah i couldn't imagine editing um some of my papers [laughter] by hand 

171.53 172.81 B: yeah 

172.23 177.20 A: i couldn't imagine the time that it would take i i guess 

177.62 181.21 A: um it allows me time because i work too 

181.23 182.46 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

181.66 186.54 A: um that you know i wouldn't have to sleep [laughter] 

186.57 188.02 B: right um 

187.10 189.45 A: you know how that is [laughter] 

188.47 195.61 B: now you said you were a graduate student so ah h- may i ask how old you are i know that's inna- that's not appropriate to ask but 

194.65 196.52 A: [mn] i'm twenty nine 

196.02 200.72 B: okay so did you learn typing when you went to ah 

196.66 197.63 A: yeah 

201.01 202.16 B: high school 

202.15 214.96 A: no ah when i was in high school they didn't have ah actually they started a computer program my senior year and i wasn't i was on a different track and it wasn't part of my curriculum so 

202.78 203.63 B: okay 

205.81 206.69 B: [noise] 

209.39 210.35 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

215.01 217.29 A: i taught myself actually 

217.30 224.50 A: i taught myself [laughter] i got a job at an internet service provider ah working for them and 

224.56 228.73 A: i lied [laughter] to get the job and said that i had com 

227.79 230.21 B: oh you told them you were computer proficient 

229.53 239.02 A: yes so i had to learn very quickly um on the job i tho- i know that's horrible but you don't know me [laughter] 

238.20 242.20 B: [laughter] that's right i'll probably never run into you so don't worry about it don't being embarrassed 

239.38 241.44 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

241.71 243.29 A: [laughter] so 

242.35 244.50 B: i wo- ah go ahead 

243.99 246.36 A: no but that's my story 

246.09 260.82 B: okay um i was ah well i'm i'm twenty two i'm getting ready to graduate my senior year here at u._t. and ah i started learning how to use a computer when i was still in elementary school 

246.49 247.86 A: (( that's how i learned )) 

260.39 261.68 A: wow 

261.08 274.24 B: we played ah little computer games really simple computer games like organ trail [noise] and others which [mn] i remember back then seemed so amazing but nowadays i see commercials for computer games and it's 

274.25 281.73 B: it's i don't see i can see how some people could sometimes get confused between which is the reality and which is the 

281.72 291.48 B: the you know the real world but um so i've i've been using computers since ah ah since then but my 

281.99 283.05 A: mhm 

291.68 297.07 B: my parents and ah they like to take they take pleasure i think in telling me you know 

297.02 311.90 B: when ye- i'm working on a when they hear m- you know i tell em i'm working on a paper they say you know well you're lucky cause when i was you know in school we'd have to it would take us twice as long and you know how everything was just horrible and all that and they were so deprived i guess or whatever 

306.84 307.96 A: (( ahah [laughter] )) 

311.07 314.41 A: [laughter] oh yeah 

312.03 313.30 B: (( but ah )) 

314.15 316.80 B: is this the first time you've ever done one of these fisher calls 

316.18 317.68 A: yes [laughter] 

316.82 318.37 B: okay me too 

318.14 322.02 A: yeah well you know extra money for school 

318.69 319.65 B: okay 

320.95 323.39 B: sure you can't beat that 

322.74 324.66 A: mhm no 

324.70 331.87 A: but i have a little brother whose twelve [cough] and he started when he was like in preschool 

327.46 328.31 B: (( ahah )) 

331.70 333.19 B: in preschool 

332.61 333.93 A: yeah 

333.33 334.43 B: wow 

334.51 342.24 A: and i used to teach ah ah an after school program and all the kids first to fifth grade all of them knew how to use a computer 

337.64 338.51 B: yeah 

341.43 342.17 B: (( yeah )) 

342.10 347.32 B: i i would i would have to say that for the most part i fall on on the side of 

347.25 360.14 B: of you know teaching kids how to use the computers and and you know i mean i certainly you know know more about computers like my mom is just she she knows more now than she did a couple of years ago but a couple of years ago i mean 

360.12 371.40 B: like i had to show her how to turn it on and things like that so i have no problem with kids learning how to use computers i i would have to say though sometimes my concerns do fall on the side of people who say well you know 

361.70 363.14 A: mhm 

371.50 376.94 B: kids don't you know they're not going to go outside because they've got t._v. and the computer and all that kind of stuff 

374.18 375.23 A: oh 

375.79 385.91 A: [mn] i don't by into that because i'm a psychology student and i haven't seen any data to support that argument i would have to see 

377.55 378.47 B: really 

379.77 380.78 B: okay 

384.45 385.35 B: really 

385.82 399.28 A: ah what i have seen are um is research to the contrary that it is helping students yeah so [mn] unless i see something that i guess because of my 

393.93 394.97 B: really 

399.42 401.83 A: nature as a scientist i 

401.97 412.07 A: i have to see proof [laughter] before i believe it and i just don't believe that that's true i think that um that it may replace television time 

403.55 404.55 B: right 

412.19 418.05 A: ah and i think that it's better than that television because it's more interactive i 

418.47 423.75 A: i don't think the television is bad either i don't think p._b._s. is bad for kids or the discovery channel 

421.47 423.00 B: right right 

423.28 424.47 B: (( right [noise] )) 

423.81 435.89 A: but um especially what i've seen is that there is a lot of um programming for children with disabilities that allows them access to the world that they didn't have before 

431.22 432.25 B: mhm 

435.02 442.78 B: right i've heard about that so you're actually saying that instead of it taking more time away when the kids could be playing 

436.39 437.28 A: yeah 

442.64 451.61 B: it's just in reality what is happening is that it's slowly kinda slowly supplementing or taking out that t._v. time in some way 

450.17 459.61 A: well that's what i would say parents have to intervene and say you can only have you know ten hours a week in front of a screen 

451.83 452.78 B: okay 

454.83 455.73 B: right 

459.07 460.37 B: right 

459.76 460.68 A: but 

460.77 472.67 A: you know that's something that parents are just gonna to have to deal with plus the population and i think only one per cent ah of people own personal computers so it hasn't reached a proportion that 

463.53 465.07 B: that's true [noise] 

473.04 479.71 A: um would even cause any kind of you know epidemic of people not leaving their homes 

479.03 480.52 B: right 

480.31 481.54 A: yeah 

480.95 481.94 B: okay 

482.14 484.03 A: in my opinion [laughter] 

483.47 487.92 B: well that's ah why i guess that's why they they do this phone survey that's a 

487.94 490.55 B: valid point i had never really i had always 

490.60 492.53 B: i guess taken the ah 

493.07 502.06 B: argument for granted when people said you know this is just going to be more stuff in front of the t._v. but as you say i mean you you're saying that you've seen research 

502.06 508.34 B: that that indicates that it will probably merely just replace some of that time 

508.04 513.28 A: i would think so yeah i mean that's what i've seen so unless i see something to the contrary 

509.23 510.04 B: so 

512.25 513.74 B: right 

513.61 521.27 A: i mean kids are becoming a lot more overweight and that is a problem but i don't think i think that has to do with the fact that 

517.22 518.12 B: right 

521.21 530.14 A: parents aren't home and cooking for their children and kids are eating at school and in after school programs instant kind of food and stuff 

521.36 522.02 B: (( [noise] )) 

529.55 531.82 B: does your ah does any of your 

532.14 535.10 B: ah sociological research deal with children 

535.14 539.49 A: yeah it um my major right now is child development cognitive development 

536.02 536.86 B: oh 

538.02 538.88 B: okay 

539.11 540.06 B: okay 

539.71 541.25 A: so um 

540.91 550.24 B: so do you actually end up [noise] doing studies that involve i mean have you ever been involved in a study that involved children using computers 

550.10 557.40 A: actually next semester i'm talking a class called technologies of the self and it's in the child development department 

556.99 558.03 B: okay 

557.44 564.82 A: and it ah looks at the role of technology and developing lives in the lives of children 

564.34 571.79 B: okay now you said you said the title of the class was technology in the self will that study specifically how technology has affected 

571.89 574.58 B: kinda more rural poor um 

574.68 576.27 B: southern areas 

576.23 586.03 A: um i don't know but i'm from the south so my tendency i guess is to and and and i've not you know 

578.22 579.12 B: (( okay )) 

586.22 590.48 A: i would think we would look at the popula- different populations 

589.90 590.91 B: okay 

590.65 595.99 A: yeah but you're right each research study is specific to a population 

595.26 596.77 B: -lation okay 

596.62 599.89 A: yeah so someone would have to undertake that
