11.04 18.10 B: [noise] hi yes you know what i have a ten minute call do you want to just look at the backyard do you mind 

18.17 24.91 B: it will take just ten minutes [noise] sorry about that i don't want to be rude to the the call thing how are you gwen and where do you live 

24.49 28.72 A: ah i live in dennyson texas which is at lake tectoma 

26.51 27.93 B: oh my gosh and 

28.32 29.94 B: well guess where i live 

29.52 32.25 A: [mn] well i think you live in the dallas area 

31.71 33.37 B: (( yes i do how did you know )) 

33.06 40.50 A: you have sent me some emails before about different focus groups and things like that in fact that has how i became part of this 

40.01 46.01 B: oh my goodness okay well that's neat yeah because i've seen stuff on the internet too well my name is dawn 

44.09 45.06 A: yeah 

46.49 49.87 B: we need to stay on the topic i guess what does family mean to you 

50.18 55.04 A: ah i guess family means all of the loved ones and ah 

55.05 66.49 A: people that we hold dear i don't think it necessarily has to be ah especially by blood i think we sometimes can have [mn] good friends that we consider family 

66.64 72.19 B: you know what i agree with you because i my parents live in arizona 

71.60 72.62 A: mhm 

72.42 76.92 B: and um my sister i've never been close to but 

77.17 87.55 B: i have a couple of friends of mine that i've been friends with actually three girl friends one twenty years the other three fifteen years and i think of them as my sisters hm 

87.19 99.38 A: well i lost both of my parents very young so i have not had a lot of family so i have had to surround myself with people who have become family to me and i think that's why i was so quick to ah 

99.41 111.53 A: say you know that it doesn't necessarily have to be blood i too have just one sister is all of the family that i have left and she's ten years older than i am and we've never been close whenever 

111.32 113.83 B: now do you are you married yourself with children 

111.61 112.43 A: (( so )) 

113.58 122.29 A: yes i am i ah have a daughter who is twenty seven and have been married for thirty one years to the same man and ah 

121.17 124.62 B: oh that's so sweet i've been married for almost ten years 

123.97 129.04 A: ten years well we have been we have actually been together since i was fourteen so [mn] 

128.21 132.69 B: oh my goodness so just last year no i'm just kidding anyway [laughter] 

130.21 142.04 A: [laughter] well you know he and actually his family seems as much a family [noise] to me as mine does and i think probably because whenever we met i had just lost my father 

141.91 143.15 B: oh 

141.98 148.22 A: and ah and then three years later [noise] we got married when i was seventeen and he was twenty one 

148.37 156.47 A: and ah and then my mother died the following year so i became very close to his parents and [mn] then later 

155.14 157.50 B: you obviously have a good marriage too 

157.23 170.09 A: oh yeah yeah and then later actually [mn] had a really good friend that i met later in life that i actually called mom so that's why i think that sometimes friends can ah 

170.44 179.99 A: become substitute family for us especially like in your instance where they're they're a long ways away and [mn] um you know in my instance where you just don't have many 

179.87 188.04 B: exactly and i do believe i do wish things were like they were back in the seventies where all the moms stayed home 

187.90 189.64 A: oh me too [laughter] 

188.03 199.93 B: you know i know that sounds silly and maybe that i don't think this is really off topic but i don't you know families eat together i wish life was back like that because i grew up and had a good 

190.11 191.05 A: uh-huh 

199.91 208.57 B: childhood and it was a very relaxed childhood does that make sense like you know and i wish my life style was like that now 

204.06 204.98 A: (( ahah )) 

208.43 213.95 A: well [mn] i was very lucky because i actually got pregnant while i was going to college 

213.69 214.87 B: oh 

214.02 228.21 A: and we had never ever relied on my income to keep the household going [mn] so whenever i got pregnant i was able to stay home and i did not work fulltime until my daughter was sixteen years old 

219.44 220.74 B: exactly 

227.38 229.07 B: oh that's nice 

228.42 233.25 A: so i am a big [mn] proponent of the same thing in fact i think that 

233.02 245.56 A: you know as far as families go i think families would be in much better shape i- i've often said that i think we should legislate [mn] that new mothers have to stay home until the children are three [noise] if there was a law that ah says that 

245.86 251.45 A: they had to stay at home and could not work but would be funded you know 

250.80 260.21 B: huh oh boy that would be hard but you know what i think it is people live and i will be honest with you my husband and i'm being straightforward with you he makes twenty five thousand a year we cannot live off that 

259.83 260.70 A: yeah 

260.12 272.02 B: so i work from home but at least i am home i am there for my daughter like right now if my daughter says mom i want you to hold me she's four mom i want you to spend time with me i can be there for her i can 

261.42 262.22 A: yeah 

269.51 270.44 A: yeah 

270.95 272.29 A: exactly 

272.01 280.07 B: which is great but and you know i'm always there for her but i will be honest i would rather not anything and just just take care of her 

279.97 288.08 B: [noise] my husband would like to have another child and it's not that i'm not open to it but i'm thirty eight i really don't want to have another one because 

288.06 294.60 B: basically i couldn't do everything that i'm doing now and i would ba- my husband would have to basically have two jobs because 

294.52 303.70 B: even you can live on a budget and you can live frugally and there's things you can give up because we all live within our means well hopefully like we don't have debt or anything but 

296.30 297.24 A: right 

300.20 301.03 A: right 

303.85 308.00 B: i think that there's only so much you can live off does that make sense 

307.33 309.86 A: oh absolutely absolutely 

308.42 315.72 B: i mean you know see my dad was a truck driver and my dad was a union man and he always made good income so mom could stay home 

311.13 312.20 A: (( mhm )) 

315.55 329.37 B: i mean i agree i think there is a lot of women that could stay home but their lifestyles in the situation where they can't you see jobs aren't secure like years ago all of our neighbors they had the same job for like twenty years 

328.80 329.80 A: mhm 

329.59 332.38 B: nowadays you don't have job security 

331.99 342.66 A: no [mn] but i think people yeah but i think you know we could have had a whole lot more than we had when our daughter was little if i had chosen to work [mn] 

332.78 334.66 B: and people don't prepare 

342.12 343.15 B: yeah 

342.48 349.21 A: but we'd made the decision and i think that's the operative word in families is you have to make a decision 

348.48 350.00 B: exactly 

349.33 360.26 A: that the children come first and my career in fact recent well not recently in the last ten years whenever i have interviewed for jobs i even had men to say to me you know 

353.87 354.52 B: (( [cough] )) 

360.60 372.47 A: do you regret you know not starting a career younger and i said no i've got the rest of my life to work you know my family was what was important you know i was there for everything 

370.29 371.34 B: (( yeah )) 

372.13 383.20 B: and it too it just i think you have to put everything into let's just put it this way i think it's best if mom stays home if you can afford it you know and if you can make the sacrifice i mean 

379.40 380.30 A: yeah 

382.04 383.45 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

383.18 391.09 B: in some situations maybe some people can't like say for example the woman is a professional and she makes money what do you think about dad staying home like say he if he was 

390.57 394.69 A: i have no problem i just think a parent [laughter] you know 

394.49 403.42 A: a parent i don't care if it is male or female that doesn't make me any different i think that whoever is the parent should 

399.05 400.04 B: yeah 

403.27 409.59 A: take care of the child it should not be with someone who has nothing vested in that child's best interests i 

410.19 416.18 A: mean let's face it day care workers make minimum wage they don't care what's going on 

414.77 418.01 B: yeah they don't make much money 

417.76 422.71 A: no and you know they're there to put in their time and go home i mean i'm not 

421.77 429.95 B: well some of them care because i worked at a day care and i really cared about those kids i mean i didn't even like going on vacation because i didn't want anybody else to take care of them 

428.97 434.09 A: [mn] well but i think that i think that's more of the norm i don't you know i 

434.45 442.65 A: you know there there are well run day care centres i'm not going to say they're not but in my but in my opinion there isn't anything 

442.31 443.95 B: that compares to mommy 

442.64 450.71 A: that takes right that takes the place in fact my own daughter you know plans to have children at some point and i have always told her you know if 

450.74 459.66 A: if push comes to shove i will take care of the baby the first year you know if you can't stay home i mean it's that important to me 

457.19 458.61 B: well not that that's 

459.17 464.89 B: well not that that's not great that you want to do that and i'm not saying that your daughter would do this 

462.46 463.71 A: mhm 

465.15 467.87 B: but some people take advantage 

468.07 469.40 A: oh certainly 

468.23 470.98 B: of their parent i'm not saying your child would do that 

469.83 471.40 A: (( oh no mm mm )) 

471.50 478.15 A: no she knows you know how how [laughter] how deeply i feel about this and i just you know 

476.75 479.16 B: well now are you working a fulltime job now 

478.80 487.89 A: yes i do i actually office out of my home ah i yeah i manage a large group of people and so my office is in my home so 

481.53 482.51 B: oh you do 

487.93 500.27 A: um you know i do have some flexibility there i would not be able to work i would not work at all if i was to take care of my daughter's child you know i would just quit you know and take or take leave you know take a family and 

499.14 501.92 B: hopefully she will be able to quit and stay home herself 

501.15 513.94 A: [mn] exactly and and i think that she feels it's important enough too having been raised by a stay at home mom i think that's the difference too in families that i see today is that 

514.27 520.85 A: the girls that are my the women not girls but the women that are my daughter's age that are having the children now 

520.62 531.56 A: a lot of them did not have a stay at home mom so they don't see the value in it it's really people who are my age that are in their forties who had the advantage of having a stay at home mom you know 

530.42 536.69 B: mhm my mom my mom was a stay at home mom and i i had a very nice lifestyle [noise] 

535.54 536.50 A: mhm 

536.94 542.67 B: (( [noise] do you want me to hand them to you just say please caroline and mom will hand them to you but use your manners )) 

537.93 539.57 A: [laughter] 

543.02 544.77 A: how old is caroline 

543.48 546.76 B: okay she's four here you go caroline there you go 

546.05 547.86 A: (( oh that's such a sweety )) 

547.24 550.85 B: she's a cutie pie she's so cu- she's a sweet little girl 

550.78 560.96 A: well you know i it's just that families are so important and it scares me to death to think that the families that are 

560.88 573.23 A: that have young children i mean the norm is not you where you know where the mom or the dad is staying home taking care of the children [mn] and i keep looking at these kids that you know are being shuttled to day care every day 

573.02 584.81 A: that these are going to be our leaders of tomorrow and you know their values and and i mean you know let's face it the day care has the child more than the parents have the child 

583.62 592.49 B: you know what you're right you're right i think a balance is good like you know like a mother stay out or and part time that wouldn't be bad you know 

588.99 590.24 A: oh yeah 

591.58 599.27 A: oh no i mean i'm not saying that the child has been to sewn to the mom's hip i mean even you know even once penny was old enough to 

595.53 597.23 B: oh yeah 

597.56 599.89 B: but i don't agree with the seven to six thirty
