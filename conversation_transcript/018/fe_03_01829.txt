16.65 17.98 A: (( ah what what )) 

18.25 24.87 A: was the topic it's education ah specific was it specifically something or just general education 

24.24 30.93 B: (( kinda [noise] my guess um i [cough] personally think that [noise] computers are extremely important in terms of being able to process and provide ah large amounts of information in a very short amount of time i think however that um sometimes they can misused ah i know that i um )) 

27.64 29.03 A: oh okay [noise] 

30.98 33.48 B: (( and have been involved in the education ah ah field as a )) 

33.50 35.18 B: (( teacher and i've seen kids )) 

34.72 36.25 A: (( [noise] ahah okay [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

35.68 38.59 B: (( play games and do other things when they're supposed to be doing academics types )) 

38.67 40.36 B: (( of stuff )) 

40.47 45.14 B: (( types of things they're playing games and doing other things so i think they can be primarily for )) 

45.30 47.89 B: (( the most )) 

48.96 52.37 B: (( part i think they're a major advantage but what about you oh )) 

53.03 54.71 B: (( [laughter] he wants to )) 

55.84 57.46 B: (( give his input too )) 

57.73 58.92 B: (( oh oh )) 

58.97 59.53 B: (( [laughter] )) 

59.93 65.03 B: (( um [noise] i have to say i i think computers are a wonderful power tool )) 

65.06 67.66 B: (( but that we're still doing some catching up )) 

68.54 74.09 B: (( in terms of pedagogical you know the appropriate pedagogical techniques to use them in classrooms i )) 

73.22 74.87 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

74.45 77.43 B: (( personally ah have been in classrooms where there is a )) 

75.02 75.84 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

76.09 77.00 A: yeah 

77.93 78.90 B: (( computer )) 

79.01 79.80 B: (( in )) 

79.84 83.25 B: (( front of every student ah [noise] [noise] )) 

83.15 90.46 A: [noise] i think they're ah [noise] i i [noise] agree ah you know i've got a two year old in the background and i'm trying to 

88.47 89.59 B: (( [noise] )) 

90.70 91.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

92.05 93.86 B: (( [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

95.31 99.40 A: (( trying to [noise] okay buddy you want some )) 

99.81 101.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

102.13 103.25 A: (( of )) 

103.84 111.56 A: (( that yeah he wants to give his input too you wanna know what he wants [noise] he )) 

111.62 113.74 A: (( wants to input some )) 

114.15 114.97 A: (( chips )) 

116.57 123.08 A: (( in his mouth and i don't have any [laughter] in )) 

125.55 126.36 A: (( you )) 

126.88 127.87 A: (( know )) 

128.27 135.93 A: within graduate school and ah well i should say it was an undergraduate class but ah no it was a graduate class anyway 

135.73 148.34 A: you know but at the beginning of that cl- the semester everyone was paying attention to the professor and by the end of the semester fifty per cent of the people were paying attention to the professor and the other fifty were surfing the web and checking their email 

148.79 163.41 A: [laughter] in general just showing up to be there and then leaving and that's i i found it distracting being one of the people who was trying to pay attention to the class that you know all the screens around me were switching but i think also you know 

164.08 170.22 A: [lipsmack] once you're once you're um ah sort of ah you've adapted to 

170.64 183.12 A: ah once you've adapted to that environment maybe that's not such a big issue i also know that um you know there's a lot of success using um what they're calling cognitive tutors you know these sort of 

183.07 185.99 A: intelligent tutoring programs so 

186.13 190.80 A: i don't know i think like you said i think they're they're a really wonderful tool they can be 

191.00 194.70 A: just as disruptive as they can be helpful if they're applied wrong and 

195.10 196.08 A: um 

196.27 200.65 A: (( they're also sort of an inevitably [laughter] you know like in a different way )) 

199.06 200.35 B: yeah 

200.64 206.08 B: that's true but that's like anything else i think almost any tool 

206.27 207.36 B: (( that [mn] )) 

207.86 212.33 B: that is is used to to do a certain job or 

212.37 216.31 B: provide a certain function can also be misused 

214.49 215.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

216.41 217.27 A: yeah 

216.56 221.69 B: and if it's misused then it's not of not of great value in that sense 

221.74 222.64 A: (( yep [noise] [noise] )) 

221.90 226.77 B: but that doesn't mean it's no good intrinsically you know it still has 

227.03 230.67 B: a great deal of of value overall 

230.77 244.16 A: moreover i think also it's a little bit there is a little bit of ah pandora's box aspect too in the sense that you know once you begin to put computers in a classroom or even 

231.16 232.59 B: (( i mean that's what i think )) 

238.30 238.87 B: (( [noise] )) 

244.44 257.14 A: begin to put computers in front of kids for a purpose of learning which is certainly a good purpose ah there is no going back you know you can't decide oh this isn't working we're going to get rid of these things 

257.32 258.28 A: so 

258.93 261.61 B: yeah i i agree 

262.01 264.15 B: (( [mn] i think for the most [noise] part though )) 

264.81 266.51 B: they provide a real 

266.96 272.40 B: ah a great assistance to the kids i mean because like you said you you were talking about the cognitive 

268.01 268.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

271.56 273.12 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

272.58 274.07 B: (( ah tutoring )) 

274.24 281.66 B: and i think that works very well i mean i have some friends now who are teachers and computers do a great job of um you 

278.28 279.62 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

282.06 287.34 B: know [mn] kind of tutoring kids in maths and reading and all those you know the basic um 

288.34 289.60 B: skills 

290.35 297.97 B: [mn] but i think i think they work pretty well but i think you know just like just like anything else it kind works both ways i guess 

297.66 304.13 A: yeah yeah there's a group there's a group [noise] that comes out of [noise] um 

299.36 300.87 B: (( yeah so um [mn] )) 

305.16 307.52 A: (( carnegie mellon systems [mn] )) 

307.54 308.71 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

308.57 311.00 A: designing these systems where 

311.20 312.12 A: the 

312.19 313.95 A: the computer 

314.05 318.91 A: is tutoring the students and [noise] it's adaptively 

318.96 320.25 A: um 

321.21 324.07 A: you know adjusting what it's teaching the students 

324.19 327.90 A: based on the students' performance i think it's really kinda incredible 

328.50 329.27 B: (( [noise] yeh )) 

331.35 335.47 A: [noise] so [noise] do you work you you work in education still 

331.86 332.68 B: maybe 

336.07 340.20 B: um no i actually don't i'm i'm actually 

340.83 344.29 B: (( a [mn] consultant for um [mn] )) 

342.47 343.25 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

345.04 355.05 B: um [noise] i actually work for a consulting firm now we actually go around and do all types of management consulting for different types of firms and that kind of thing 

355.15 356.69 B: (( what do you do [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

356.33 358.82 A: (( [noise] [noise] ah i'm ah )) 

358.93 363.29 A: (( graduate research assistant and ah )) 

363.32 372.39 A: part of why i know about this these cognitive tutors that are being developed at carnegie melon is i work with computers and logistics 

372.67 373.92 A: (( and ah )) 

374.28 379.42 A: it's an interest of mine is to sort of ah see how computers can be used 

379.65 383.83 A: ah model the way a human being think or to enhance 

384.07 387.43 A: a ah cognitive ability to people and 

387.91 389.03 A: so ah 

389.46 392.13 A: (( it's an interesting time an interesting field )) 

392.00 396.92 B: [noise] [noise] yeah it sounds very interesting what what are you are you working on a degree in something or [noise] 

396.74 402.68 A: yeah i'm working on a phd ah i'm working in a phd in library and information science 

402.79 412.18 A: ah but i'm particularly interested in information seeking behaviors and where people get their strategies for finding information 

412.20 416.30 A: and the degree to which [noise] um 

416.31 419.93 A: those strategies are sort of encoded in our language 

420.18 424.49 A: [noise] which is how [noise] i happen to know a bunch of complicational linguists 

424.58 437.69 A: ah which is how i happen to get an email saying oh there's this fisher project and they're looking for callers [laughter] [laughter] and that that puts me here talking to you while driving down the road on my cell phone 

430.82 432.04 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

437.55 439.42 B: yeah and i am too 

437.93 439.03 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

439.91 443.32 B: let me ask you this do you know what the purpose of this study is [noise] 

443.62 455.08 A: [lipsmack] um i don't know exactly what they're going to do with this collection but ah i know i know some of the kinds of things they do um with 

455.17 458.25 A: these [noise] recordings so you [noise] 

458.21 470.03 A: can they'll probably be tran- probably though these will be manually transcribed certainly someone will try running automated ah speech recognition against them [lipsmack] um 

469.84 478.61 A: they might be analyzed for all kinds of linguistic features like ah you know discourse analysis um [noise] 

478.60 492.38 A: like when i'm going um i'm sort of when i'm you know you and i have take taking turns [noise] talking i don't know exactly what they're going to do you know with this particular collection but i know that's the kind of things [noise] that they have been doing with 

492.44 494.35 A: similar ah 

494.42 498.88 A: databases of telephone conversations they have been doing it for a few years too 

499.10 501.77 A: it's kinda cool [laughter] 

499.38 499.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

500.33 501.90 B: have you done them before 

501.98 506.02 A: no no this is the well you're the third call that i've done 

506.02 520.72 A: so i got two calls at home and then they stopped calling me at home and then i noticed they tried calling me a couple of times over the last day or two specifically on my cell phone so i'm guessing they're trying to collect more cell phone data 

521.10 522.04 A: um 

522.04 523.05 B: mhm 

522.30 523.23 A: kinda neat
