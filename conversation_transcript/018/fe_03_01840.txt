356.56 357.24 A: (( [laughter] )) 

357.70 370.37 B: i go online for my graduate school class because what it does is my um it's a speciality where i go and what it does is it allows people like i have one class online some of them are on campus 

370.00 371.35 A: mhm 

370.82 374.66 B: at pennsylvania college of optometry but some of them aren't

377.30 378.58 A: oh great 

378.41 387.50 B: so what it does is we have people in our class because you had to go online discussion boards from like new mexico we had them from all over 

387.55 388.68 A: yeah 

387.82 401.46 B: um we had people so it was like okay well at least i'm getting to know people i mean like people from all over can benefit because they don't have the program everywhere so that meant that it's sort of like closing the gap 

395.53 396.97 A: yeah sure 

401.47 407.06 B: and helping people because they really need teachers of the visually impaired so it is sort of like

415.75 416.82 A: mhm 

416.05 430.71 B: and one group had to make products like brochures you know about services one group had to do different activities and then one had to get online and talk about stuff i chose the wrong group because i chose the one that um 

419.63 420.60 A: okay 

421.08 422.01 A: yeah 

427.07 428.08 A: okay

444.42 455.38 A: yeah that part of it yeah to me it seems like i don't know i i i would have to actually go on it and see what it's like to me it doesn't seem like i'd rather i'd rather be in a classroom [laughter] you know than 

445.57 446.40 B: but 

454.62 468.61 B: you know what i thought i would but the thing is this class they don't offer it on campus so i had no choice it was like okay i'm getting my masters this is my program if it is not offered on campus then you know it's like okay 

459.79 462.50 A: well sure sure you can't do that you have
