15.22 20.49 B: so [laughter] but then she got computers and she's like oh i don't know if i like these topics 

20.25 21.47 A: oh 

21.03 26.87 B: but family's pretty good [noise] i think that is probably an easy one um to talk about 

26.59 27.45 A: oh yeah 

27.75 28.66 B: go ahead 

28.93 35.40 A: um i i guess what family means [noise] i i guess it's different what family means to us individually or 

35.13 37.75 B: i guess probably 

37.78 41.06 B: maybe what your views on on family are or 

41.17 42.39 B: i don't know 

42.53 45.83 B: ah 'cause it just says what yeah what does family mean to you 

46.67 49.63 A: i guess family is pretty important to me um 

49.71 61.33 A: i have right now i don't have any children or anything i just i live with my fiance we are getting more married in a few months and i have a pretty small family just you know um mum and dad and two brothers 

60.36 61.64 B: (( yeah ahah )) 

62.45 71.37 B: yeah that's what we have a we have i just have a daughter and a son and my daughter got married two years ago so god bless your mother 'cause [laughter] 

69.40 73.23 A: yeah [laughter] they're we're really going through it right now [noise] oh 

72.24 78.68 B: and it only gets worse let me tell you but i think i kind of feel the same way um 

74.46 76.08 A: [laughter] 

79.62 85.11 B: my mum died when i was young so all i had was my dad so i think 

81.52 82.53 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

83.35 84.52 A: mhm 

85.26 93.97 B: i really like having family close to me like all my family i want to live within and i know this is unreasonable within like fifteen or twenty minutes 

93.99 95.59 B: of where i live 

94.26 95.12 A: oh 

95.76 100.74 A: well that's how it is i'm i'm in i don't know where you're from i'm in west virginia and it's sort 

99.50 101.31 B: oh we're in pennsylvania 

101.16 104.67 A: see it's sort where i live it's sort of a small area 

104.09 105.33 B: mhm 

104.69 107.81 A: so everybody lives close to everybody here 

108.07 114.27 A: and that's important to me too because my mum didn't have a very good relationship with her parents growing up 

113.86 114.75 B: (( ahah )) 

114.43 116.51 A: and my grandmother just died like 

116.48 117.47 B: oh 

116.54 122.21 A: two years ago and they didn't really patch things up so it's important to me to keep a good relationship with my family 

121.78 134.17 B: yeah yeah i think when you see that um you know when you come from a background where you see like like with me losing my mum it was just so important to me to have a good relationship 

122.48 123.67 A: to make sure 

134.27 137.37 B: and i probably didn't realize that until i was older 

134.33 135.56 A: mhm 

137.48 139.96 B: you know and how much i would miss her 

139.91 141.28 A: right 

140.41 143.49 B: so you know i feel bad for your mum because i know what that 

143.55 145.23 B: what that's like [mn] [lipsmack] 

145.13 146.30 A: mhm 

145.63 151.01 B: you know and then my dad passed away a couple of years ago and we were very close 

151.02 153.62 B: but ah that was hard 

153.69 158.84 B: even though we were close i felt like i didn't get a chance to say goodbye so i think family 

153.86 154.67 A: mhm 

159.02 162.13 B: and family values are probably pretty important 

162.40 163.67 A: yeah 

162.56 164.11 B: to us you know 

164.35 167.16 A: you see my mum's family um 

167.41 168.95 A: they were german 

169.20 179.09 A: and she has several brothers and sisters who she never met because her mother had she had children in germany before um before she moved to the states with my grandfather who was a soldier 

175.72 176.76 B: oh 

178.77 179.59 B: (( ahah )) 

179.67 186.78 A: and they her her mother my great grandmother wouldn't let her bring her younger children and she 

185.85 187.04 B: oh 

186.88 193.48 A: said that it would be disruptive for them to have to leave their country and everything so she left her children there and she saw them once before she died so 

191.10 192.25 B: oh boy 

193.10 195.14 B: oh that had to be hard 

194.52 205.41 A: it is especially since um my mum didn't have a good relationship with her mum and then there's you know knowing that you have family that you've never met you know brothers and sister not just distant so 

201.97 203.28 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

204.82 206.28 B: yeah yeah 

205.96 210.98 A: i think it's important to keep all of your family close [noise] and make sure you know 

208.70 219.29 B: yeah yeah we have yeah because i think well my dad was raised in an orphanage so he didn't have anybody and my mother had eight brothers and sisters 

215.22 216.70 A: [noise] 

219.28 224.83 B: but they all had various forms of cancer so there's only two of them left 

224.82 226.13 A: mhm 

224.99 227.28 B: so and they all died when i was young [mn] 

227.74 240.38 B: you know except for the two that are left who thank goodness are in their eighties and doing very well um so i try to keep you know remember to try and keep in contact um i think people's lives get really busy 

227.76 229.00 A: mhm 

240.24 241.48 A: mhm 

240.72 242.95 B: and you know they just don't

246.73 247.31 B: (( mhm )) 

247.20 253.83 A: definitely i um i'm in college right now i moved away just it's just about an hour away from home 

253.96 260.91 A: and i don't get home to see my family as often as i'd like not because of the distance just because i get so busy with work and everything 

259.64 263.68 B: yeah yeah there's so much to do so much else that you have to do 

263.49 265.04 A: mhm the plan-

291.63 294.23 B: oh oh it all falls into place 

294.39 301.87 B: you know i mean we didn't get the wedding dress altered or we got her dress altered but her bridesmaids her maid of honor came from australia

373.99 382.67 B: yeah but i'm looking at it from the mother's aspect too because my daughter my son is now he's twenty six and now he's 

382.57 393.84 B: pretty seriously involved with a young woman who is extremely nice but like now i'm seeing it from the other side you know they always say huh what is it a a

408.63 423.33 B: you know and my daughter was so upset and she said well that's it we'll never see his kids [laughter] you know and they're just dating but it it it's kind of funny so you have to remember that from your mother in law's point of of view 

414.66 415.94 A: [laughter] 

417.92 419.31 A: [laughter] 

423.17 431.98 A: oh definitely definitely we actually um i spend most we spend most holidays with his family because my family is small they don't do anything major 

429.73 430.84 B: (( [laughter] )) 

431.66 432.73 B: okay

443.10 444.18 A: mhm 

443.11 454.51 B: but it was like really the saddest easter i think we've ever had because he wasn't here and i and you know i like family around but i i can understand that he has to put a good foot forward and 

454.13 455.58 A: mhm 

454.93 456.65 B: you know make this family 

456.61 470.31 A: well this is just him and his brother his mum you know she's obviously not having any more kids [laughter] so i've made sure that she's involved with the wedding planning and stuff because i know this is the only probably the only wedding she will ever get to be involved with so 

461.55 463.33 B: yeah yeah so 

465.82 467.18 B: (( [noise] )) 

469.34 472.06 B: (( [laughter] )) 

470.48 473.17 A: i don't think his brother is ready to settle down any time soon 

473.32 474.38 A: [laughter] 

473.36 481.06 B: yeah that's that's what [laughter] that's funny because [mn] my son in law he was raised by his grandmother and two aunts 

481.08 483.80 B: um his mum left when he was three 

483.85 484.71 A: oh 

484.23 490.34 B: and she showed up like she sort of came back into their lives like six months before the wedding 

490.41 499.72 B: and at that point we were like so stressed out and and you're trying to be nice and i said she said she wanted be invited to the wedding and i said you haven't seen this kid 

492.42 493.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

499.63 500.79 A: mhm 

499.88 505.37 B: in you know fifteen years or more 'cause i mean he's thirty four so [mn] 

505.46 512.92 B: and then all of a sudden you want to be invited to the wedding and i thought all right back off this is his mother and you don't know what the history is 

513.00 515.75 B: so you know let them come to the wedding 

515.96 517.28 A: mhm 

515.97 521.41 B: so she came to the shower and that was the first i met her and she seemed like a really nice woman and he said to h- 

521.52 528.14 B: to him she's just a stranger but he did it for his aunts because his aunts said that was you know they wanted her there 

527.92 529.28 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

528.70 540.40 B: and then it it came about it was really hard because she came there to the shower and he has a sister that he wasn't raised with she took the sister and left him 

532.94 534.06 A: (( [noise] )) 

540.20 541.49 A: oh 

541.12 553.36 B: [noise] and so she came to the shower too and i thought well maybe this will develop into a relationship but it hasn't but then she came she wanted to come to the wedding and i thought well that's fine but then she asked 

553.17 562.15 B: to invite like her brother and her best friend and i was like no way and then i like then i hit the ceiling i'm like no wait a minute we're paying for this 

556.30 557.82 A: (( [laughter] )) 

561.70 562.94 A: mhm 

562.19 576.60 B: you know these people were basically strangers and so then i was like well you know it's fine whatever joe wants is fine and that's what i just kept saying what does he want because i thought if he says yes then that's fine you know if not 

570.68 571.35 A: [laughter] 

576.47 583.44 B: but i did let his aunts his aunts got involved in the shower and the wedding and stuff because that was basically his mother [mn] 

583.46 584.57 A: mhm 

583.61 584.44 B: but 

584.53 594.14 B: our wedding invitation read like a book [noise] [laughter] be- because on our side it was just us but on his side he had his two aunts and his dad 

586.99 589.96 A: [laughter] 

593.93 599.95 B: you know and [laughter] it's like and i think his grandmother's name was on there and i thought oh but 

595.87 597.28 A: [laughter]
