171.36 172.69 A: yeah 

172.61 178.18 B: i always look at people and think you know i wonder if this person is about to pull you know and 

178.28 183.77 B: i mean i remember driving on september eleventh cause i had to go return a movie and people were driving like they were crazy 

183.56 184.57 A: mhm 

183.84 193.80 B: and i'm like calm down you know i mean why do you have to act like this and and curse me out or whatever and you know you don't i mean everybody thought the world was ending 

186.05 187.24 A: yeah 

193.59 194.61 A: right 

194.22 196.05 B: and there was no peace

203.69 204.84 B: right

206.92 208.94 A: yeah exactly 

209.00 210.20 A: yeah 

209.57 214.32 B: you might flip that person off and a mile down the road and then they get in a big old car wreck you know i mean 

213.45 220.25 A: right and then you say oh man and you always have to think they're probably a nice person they might just be having a bad day 

215.45 217.28 B: [laughter] i shouldn't of done that 

219.93 221.24 B: right 

220.62 221.57 A: (( you know )) 

221.51 222.58 B: right 

221.97 226.28 A: and they have a they probably have a family obviously somebody probably loves them and 

225.72 230.44 B: right right [laughter] but i mean i know that i strongly 

226.45 227.48 A: [laughter] 

230.58 238.33 B: you know i did you know i mean i had a child out of wed lock and i kind of went against my parents you know i had to drop out of college and then i ended up i'm back in it now 

238.03 239.04 A: right 

238.60 242.72 B: but they supported me through everything you know [noise] 

241.87 242.84 A: uh-huh 

243.12 248.55 B: they're really really good parents and i have to always thank them for that you know at first they weren't all 

248.67 250.97 B: there for me but i mean they came through 

250.78 252.00 A: yeah 

251.38 255.53 B: they handled it better than i thought they would and now you know this is their grandbaby you know 

255.83 259.32 B: they want her all of the time and you can have her [laughter] you know 

255.86 256.79 A: right 

258.11 259.22 A: [laughter] 

259.49 264.78 B: but i i love my daughter she's she's wild and i stay home during the day with her 

264.45 265.51 A: mhm 

264.79 269.27 B: [noise] and uh yeah and i go to school 

269.84 270.94 B: and um 

270.97 274.66 B: it's hard hard living like this but um 

274.29 279.08 A: it is i'm a nurse so i so families change all the time 

275.28 276.28 B: we'll make it 

278.92 280.67 B: mhm oh yeah 

279.86 283.00 A: cause people get in a car accident and horrible things happen to them 

283.56 290.35 A: and then all of a sudden you see their family come together around this one person who's been injured horribly 

286.96 287.98 B: right 

290.68 292.13 A: and um 

292.14 294.64 A: i guess they don't realise what they have until 

294.67 299.66 A: they almost yeah you know they come close to losing a family member 

294.90 296.36 B: it's almost gone 

297.72 301.03 B: [noise] right 

300.67 302.70 A: so it's kind of neat to see that 

302.47 307.27 B: right yeah my boyfriend he had taken a fall in his job and they thought he was gonna die 

306.95 307.87 A: mhm 

307.50 309.97 B: and he wasn't talking to his mother then 

310.26 315.70 B: and now they're they're close they're very very close cause she realised 

315.40 316.58 A: mhm 

315.86 319.09 B: you know she almost lost her son you better like 

319.40 321.54 B: get through our differences right now 

321.23 322.26 A: right 

321.98 328.05 B: and some people have that chance which is lucky you know my mu- my friend's mother she just passed but they knew she was very sick 

328.25 333.33 B: and she got a chance to tell her what she had to but a lot of people they don't have that chance 

333.03 334.02 A: right 

334.08 335.23 A: (( right that's true )) 

334.11 338.16 B: that you should always be close no matter what 

337.48 338.51 A: uh-huh 

338.37 341.59 B: you know so i'm close to my parents 

339.86 340.63 A: (( i'm )) 

340.98 348.37 A: i think a lot of people should let bygones be bygones you know how some people hold a grudge for years and years my mother in law's like that 

345.98 347.09 B: right 

348.47 349.39 B: right 

348.82 353.88 A: she doesn't speak to her mother because of something that happened twenty years ago that she can't even remember 

353.87 354.99 B: right 

353.96 355.21 A: and that's sad 

355.25 356.71 B: right exactly 

356.53 357.76 A: yeah 

357.17 359.78 B: you just have to like cause you never know when they're gone 

359.54 360.67 A: yeah 

360.13 363.42 B: then you're gonna wish that you would of just settled that problem 

362.88 366.47 A: yeah and it was probably something totally ridiculous 

365.79 368.14 B: they probably don't even know what it is [laughter] 

367.55 370.78 A: no she really doesn't she doesn't remember what it was about 

370.88 372.45 B: so forget it 

371.83 375.30 A: yeah but she won't talk to her because her mother won't 

375.31 377.00 A: be the first one to call 

377.49 379.27 A: like oh man [laughter] 

377.96 380.36 B: but the phone works both ways 

379.76 381.70 A: yeah yeah 

381.28 385.35 B: you know so i mean what's she gonna do if you don't want to pick up the phone pick up a pen 

385.23 386.30 A: yeah 

385.99 399.62 B: you know you do whatever you can especially you know all of this stuff others i don't i don't think i know anybody out there but like when i was in college a lot the mail they would go every month to their little thing you know and um 

400.27 408.27 B: i i really want to contract them to see if there is anybody cause that was part of my family cause i mean your friends are your family too that's how you choose your family 

407.87 409.38 A: yeah definitely 

408.80 423.39 B: and i would like to know if there is anybody that is over there but i just you know i just it's my fault because i don't try to contact i have email addresses that i could go ahead and figure is out but i but i don't i just [laughter] there's other 

423.33 435.59 B: i think that there is other things that are more important but really it's not because they need me to write a letter you know they haven't heard from me in five years hearing a you know getting a letter from somebody you know wow i'm thinking about you i support you 

428.26 429.35 A: right 

435.24 436.55 A: yeah 

436.00 438.50 B: that would be nice it's just i'm lazy [laughter] 

438.18 441.67 A: yeah i know it's hard sometimes to just take the time but then 

441.85 444.09 A: yeah they are worth the time 

444.15 451.21 B: right they are especially i feel so bad when i see all the families up on there and it's like i could make a difference i need to call them up too 

450.96 451.97 A: right 

451.67 454.82 B: to say well even though they're not part of my family now they were 

454.59 456.66 A: yeah definitely 

456.41 457.64 B: (( but it's hard )) 

456.71 458.95 A: friends are definitely part of family 

458.69 463.26 B: right and i mean it's still sad you know cause i try to stay very very close 

462.90 463.95 A: mhm 

463.60 468.28 B: with mine the ones that are here and the ones that are far away those are the ones that i am losing 

468.12 469.30 A: mhm 

468.68 473.20 B: and i never really got a chance to be close with them and then i started feeling bad 

472.59 473.49 A: right 

473.54 475.20 B: because now it's too late 

473.68 475.78 A: yeah it does make you feel bad
