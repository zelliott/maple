0.09 3.09 B: hi my name is mary from illinois 

3.58 6.00 A: (( hello my name is emily from washington )) 

5.83 7.22 B: hi emily 

7.36 8.42 A: (( how are you today )) 

8.00 9.46 B: okay how are you 

9.58 11.32 A: good can you hear me okay 

10.91 13.00 B: um yeah fairly well 

13.07 15.94 A: okay i'm on a i'm on my headset so 

15.70 17.05 B: oh okay 

16.74 17.60 A: [laughter] 

17.65 21.08 A: so education and computers what are your thoughts 

20.53 24.88 B: well my thoughts are i think um they're wondrous i i think it's 

24.66 39.55 B: phenomenal that um you know they they finally installed most of the computers like for instance in our area we've been having a you know a few problems having them installed but ah i think it has really opened up education to all of the children 

39.99 40.59 A: (( mm )) 

40.82 42.10 B: what do you think 

42.04 47.42 A: um i agree that it it's provided um information free travel 

47.66 58.27 A: for people to research things they never you know could of before and it's lessened so much time and made things so much easier my basically i think my only concern is that um 

58.97 69.91 A: the computers do so much for us um in every day you know if you as far as scheduling to math and everything else that it's gonna kind of promote 

70.14 78.63 A: um i don't know if it's laziness but promote you know will keep people from learning because the computer can do so much for them 

78.93 87.54 B: well i have to agree with that i mean i'm even thinking in terms of just simply picking up and reading a book you know for most children i 

85.22 86.63 A: exactly 

87.56 91.08 B: i think that's a real for some reason 

91.46 97.99 B: it it's tough because you know everyone is relying on the computer you know it's so simple 

98.09 102.04 B: um you know to just simply log on and find your information 

102.62 103.60 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

103.55 110.77 A: and we're just i mean i i think our culture is so we're not patient enough and i mean i think before 

110.61 123.02 A: computers it was rare or not rare but you know it wasn't every kid who liked reading and who liked to sit down to read stuff and who did have reading problems and then once you have the computer added in there i mean 

123.12 129.76 A: i just don't i think reading's gonna go down um and just everyone's patience and 

129.93 135.54 A: you know you won't need to really need to learn how to spell because they computer spell checks for you and that sort of thing 

135.41 145.42 B: absolutely i you know i i just feel that you know they in some respects i i feel as if it's bad you know they're so much reliant on 

145.79 151.37 B: on the computers and it and it's just too bad that someone can't figure out a way to 

151.30 158.31 B: you know use the computers in one respect you know maybe with a school project or something like that and then 

158.25 172.98 B: you know to kinda depend on possibly the library [laughter] you know for for other items you know and and and really i believe that the the computer has become a huge babysitter you know for the kids now 

162.47 163.70 A: exactly 

164.87 166.10 A: yeah 

171.38 172.21 A: (( uh-huh )) 

172.95 179.09 B: and i mean especially at home and i don't know that um 

173.16 175.20 A: (( yeah )) 

179.25 188.75 B: you know there's enough um parent control um in that respect or even the parents saying you know what why don't we pick up a book tonight you know 

188.87 195.80 A: mm yeah the kid's gonna go i wanna play another game before i go to bed not i want to read a book 

189.77 190.68 B: so 

193.89 195.74 B: right exactly 

195.83 196.91 B: and um 

196.02 201.29 A: (( but i think it's very dangerous for kids to be left alone on the internet )) 

200.93 204.40 B: oh no i i totally agree i mean 

204.71 212.99 B: i mean i just feel that you know again i just think that there should be you know the parents you know should definitely be more involved and i don't think they are 

213.08 218.12 B: i really don't i just think they're off doing their own thing i mean some of them of course and 

213.34 214.16 A: yeah 

217.96 230.86 B: and but i think most of them you know they're not there looking over the shoulders to see who you know who they're writing to um you know and reading some of that email that's coming back to you know their their child 

218.14 219.07 A: yeah 

231.29 234.71 A: mm yeah and i think it i mean i 

234.81 247.39 A: it is the greatest tool it has helped me i mean i'm only twenty one so i just graduated from college in the last ah two years and i you know it has helped me tremendously i'm on it every day 

247.25 252.23 A: if i'm on vacation or something i don't know what to do without it but 

250.19 251.21 B: i know 

251.36 254.67 B: i know i feel the same way which is bad [laughter] 

253.90 261.98 A: yeah it is but i spent a month after um between high school and college i went to an internship for a month where they only allowed you to talk on the phone 

261.70 262.96 B: oh really 

262.10 265.54 A: and it was so nice to get away from the computer 

263.72 264.99 B: yeah 

265.22 266.15 B: yes 

265.66 271.86 A: even though like i was in like withdrawals for the first week but after that i was you know it was really nice 

271.94 275.47 B: well you know um what i find too is is that 

275.56 278.65 B: abs- for instance you know in writing an email 

278.67 286.76 B: you know there is absolutely no emotions you know that that you can you know send through through that email 

285.89 288.96 A: that's very true mhm 

286.65 297.91 B: without picking up the phone and i mean it means completely two different things you know between the email and between you know picking up the phone and having the other person hear your voice 

297.95 306.65 A: (( it is it is and that's one thing i noticed at work is that i mean people will email things that could so much easier so )) 

306.71 312.67 A: much quicker and every you know more effectively be said on the phone in you know seven seconds 

313.00 327.39 A: but because they're so used to email they'll go through the email process which might not take much longer but it's definitely less personal and um you know probably really doesn't have the same effect and i think a lot of people use the internet or email as like a 

323.62 324.67 B: right 

327.42 331.04 A: avoidance of people you know we're all just becoming more 

331.24 335.43 A: (( self reliant and we don't need people as much as we used to i think )) 

335.41 344.01 B: i agree and even you know writing letters i mean that's i mean i don't think anyone does that anymore i know i try and you know still do you know especially 

343.93 344.88 A: (( mhm )) 

344.10 347.19 B: you know like um cards or 

347.18 351.60 B: you know something that i i'd really like to you know come across 

351.51 365.96 B: you know in maybe a more personal way um you know i still try and write as much as what i possibly can but yeah you know you really fall into that trap you know you're at the computer and you figure well you know 

359.53 362.43 A: (( mhm )) 

366.46 374.67 B: the time is ticking and you might as well just you know enter your email in right now instead of you know sitting down and writing a letter 

374.73 384.80 A: mhm yeah and i mean i don't i rarely i do like birthday cards but for everything else i do ecards and it's like i know they don't have the same effect but 

380.98 382.02 B: mhm 

383.67 395.42 B: right yeah i know i've been kinda falling into the ecards too 'cause it you know again unfortunately it's so convenient it's so much easier but unfortunately 

388.46 390.69 A: (( it's just so convenient )) 

396.06 400.49 B: i don't know i think i think the computers are great but i think 

400.58 404.70 B: i think we just need to you know take a step back and really kinda 

405.11 408.36 B: look into what we're doing or not doing you know 

408.03 413.03 A: yeah exactly and i think in in the educational realm and i'm mostly speaking like 

413.04 421.25 A: k. through twelve or maybe just you know under high school age that it should be the computer shouldn't be structured the way they are in our home 

421.25 428.73 A: it should be really strict as far as what you can do on them you know what i'm talking about getting on the inappropriate web sites but more just like 

428.75 432.39 A: you know what's what kids are using them for and um 

431.12 431.96 B: right 

432.68 433.77 A: (( you know the )) 

433.79 444.38 A: there's some kind of program that helps them learn like they write an essay they have spell check and then it's not just spell check they learn why it's spelt that way or you know something like that 

443.36 458.20 B: that's true i and but but then again i think it goes back to early education that i don't really think that they the computers should you know be introduced you know in third and fourth grade i mean i think that's absolutely insane you know and 

448.55 449.74 A: (( yeah )) 

454.56 455.41 A: no 

457.09 458.73 A: i just think it's horrible 

458.23 461.50 B: you know and the you know the kids you know just like you said there's 

461.31 473.48 B: i mean certainly the you know they're gonna rely on the spell check than to pick up a dictionary in fact i have to say i doubt that too many kids you know can really actually find a word in a dictionary i mean because 

472.55 473.76 A: i know 

473.31 476.74 B: you know they're too you know in tune to the computer 

477.12 479.87 B: and um i i don't know i just 

479.78 494.15 B: i'm not completely you know convinced that you know this was the best you know set up you know for the child and i don't know that they're necessarily learning anything because they didn't have to find anything they didn't have to 

492.96 500.86 A: exactly they're learning how to find they're learning how to get the answer but they're not learning what the answer is or what it means or anything like that 

500.00 506.97 B: right and there's absolutely no research involved whatsoever except you know just for a click and that's it 

507.07 508.33 A: yeah 

507.52 510.28 B: [laughter] which is pretty sad actually 

508.37 509.93 A: (( yeah )) 

510.16 512.19 A: it is and i think i was 

512.31 520.04 A: you know i was only a couple of years away from really i mean i started getting into computers probably like seventh grade 

519.73 520.72 B: uh-huh 

520.08 521.28 A: and um 

521.34 528.82 A: i think i mean my little brother's only four years younger than me and he is way more with the computer than i am 

529.47 535.65 A: and i think i've spent more time on the computer but i mean he probably started in fifth grade getting on the computer 

535.37 536.37 B: right 

535.87 540.22 A: so i think it just keeps getting younger and younger and i mean things like 

540.44 550.63 A: i mean it's just yeah it's kinda the same thing as a calculator if you're in an advanced math class and you know exactly how to get the answer our of your calculator because of graphing functions and all that i 

550.59 557.04 A: mean i have no idea how to do it by hand i couldn't even tell you where to start i only know the process through the calculator 

556.57 557.65 B: yeah 

557.95 558.82 B: well 

558.15 559.13 A: (( and it's )) 

558.91 560.36 B: right and i 

559.78 561.62 A: no good 

560.55 565.93 B: i know that and that's something that's you know again that they introduce in in the school 

566.01 570.91 B: you know at a very early age and then unfortunately not too many people can 

570.91 583.21 B: you know for instance like if they're they're buying groceries and you know the other person is giving them back money they have absolutely no clue how much money they give back unless they enter it in the you know in the cash register 

580.08 581.35 A: (( isn't that crazy )) 

583.52 588.18 B: and then if you give them you know the correct amount 

588.84 591.98 B: then they look at you like oh my god don't confuse me 

592.00 593.22 B: [laughter] you know 

592.28 595.23 A: yeah yeah 

593.76 596.78 B: so i mean that's really [laughter] oh god it's 

595.69 597.58 A: isn't that sad it's 

597.54 599.89 B: yeah it's almost like what have we done
