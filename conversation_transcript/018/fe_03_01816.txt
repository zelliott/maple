24.30 25.51 B: it is 

26.29 27.43 A: excuse me 

26.83 29.47 B: do you want to repeat the topic of the day 

28.90 31.56 A: uh computers and education 

31.02 34.99 B: yes like how does it improve education or not 

34.69 36.94 A: i think it improves education 

36.54 42.91 B: i i think so too i i mean i don't think without computers there would we would be where we are right now what do you think 

42.37 48.78 A: no i think uh especially the internet has a lot um a lot of courses you can take on line 

45.59 46.58 B: yes 

48.42 49.74 B: definitely 

49.31 54.70 A: uh and you don't have to go out of states to you know go to college i guess so to speak 

51.48 52.39 B: mhm 

52.97 53.90 B: mhm 

54.45 60.89 B: very much very much um so how much have you have you done your education already have you 

60.59 63.61 A: uh i've done two years of uh 

63.90 65.40 A: post high school 

64.95 66.44 B: oh great 

65.81 66.89 A: um 

66.92 67.80 B: okay 

67.51 72.39 A: and i would like to do some more on line if i can i did one course on line 

72.04 73.17 B: (( oh okay )) 

73.07 82.76 B: well i i'm definitely for computers and i er i do think i mean it it it's just not about education and on line degrees and things 

82.56 91.49 B: i think it makes a whole lot of other things so much easier your software packages you know they help you in your in your different subjects like i was a psychology major 

91.26 92.33 A: mhm 

91.69 103.80 B: and i used this as b._s._s. which is the software uh program for social sciences to do my statistics and research and everything and i think if i didn't have that i would take ages to you know 

103.86 104.80 A: yeah 

104.00 109.05 B: complete my work so i definitely think it's a boon to education 

109.39 113.42 A: oh i mean how much so though i mean how much education 

112.05 116.33 B: well so much so well so much so that are you asking me that 

115.74 116.77 A: yes 

116.38 125.75 B: yeah i i i think so much so that if it weren't for that i would be you know it wouldn't be so much efficient so much quicker because you're dealing with large pools of data 

125.61 126.63 A: mhm 

125.99 127.98 B: you know and well 

127.08 128.71 A: on the computer correct 

128.59 141.86 B: well if if there weren't computers then you're dealing with large amounts of data and human error is bound to happen and you know it saves time it's more accurate and i get my statistics and my results calculated in like you know 

130.32 131.16 A: mhm 

141.63 142.68 A: (( yeah )) 

141.96 143.59 B: in a matter of minutes 

143.20 144.47 A: mhm 

143.81 155.49 B: and because i'm all the time dealing with research data like sampling and i've i've dealt with sample sizes as huge as five hundred uh you don't want to be sitting and calculating the means and averages you know 

155.09 156.81 A: yes oh yes 

155.63 160.84 B: so oh yes so i i definitely think at least in my education it's helped me a lot oh 

161.00 164.08 A: yeah it it's helped me in mine quite a bit too 

163.69 165.46 B: yeah what's your major [sigh] 

165.03 168.02 A: uh well actually i have a minor in fire science 

167.47 168.49 B: oh really 

168.03 169.13 A: so 

168.79 169.78 B: okay 

169.18 171.18 A: and i took part of that on line 

170.85 175.20 B: oh okay that's cool [mn] i haven't done any on line um 

175.21 184.67 B: education or any correspondences cour- courses or anything on line but i do think i think people do actually i don't know how much of a success is that though 

184.69 186.70 B: just on line courses 

186.41 190.03 A: um well i did one class uh it it helped me 

189.55 195.21 B: oh really and i mean do you is everything clearer and if you need 

190.11 191.60 A: yeah um 

195.33 197.18 B: anything is it all there 

196.91 203.96 A: uh yes it is [mn] the course that i took actually had a video of the professor um 

200.98 202.06 B: (( oh really )) 

203.31 204.06 B: (( oh )) 

204.42 208.23 A: talking and it was about a half a second behind you know 

207.80 208.67 B: okay 

208.57 209.77 A: and uh 

209.87 216.57 A: he was giving his you know instructions and everything and assignments right over line i could just do it right on line 

216.11 219.99 B: and was it interactive like could you ask him questions 

219.74 221.64 A: oh yeah i i could 

221.39 224.39 B: no really so is was it more like a video 

224.40 225.27 B: (( phone call )) 

224.55 228.04 A: i i had the video but he didn't know who who i was 

227.22 230.87 B: right okay all right well that must be fun though 

230.46 232.66 A: ah it was definitely interesting 

232.04 237.99 B: [laughter] yeah and i don't know i'm i'm i'm an internet bug as far as shopping is concerned 

238.07 243.96 B: i do a lot of my shopping as well on on the internet all my books and everything amazon dot com 

239.34 240.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

243.35 245.05 A: mhm 

244.29 248.78 B: so i mean and you get better and cheaper deals so why not 

247.56 250.09 A: oh yeah airline tickets as well 

249.51 251.10 B: oh yes [laughter] [mn] 

250.45 251.90 A: uh everything 

251.28 260.57 B: i mean you can just compare rates you can just compare things you can you can check you know things in stores and just sitting at home you know you don't even have to travel all that much 

260.34 262.93 A: oh one thing i do like is uh 

263.02 265.28 A: like the public records searches 

264.92 265.62 B: (( so oh )) 

265.29 266.94 A: on individuals 

266.34 267.38 B: oh yes yes 

267.23 269.97 A: um i i think that helps out quite a bit 

269.41 276.28 B: oh yes because um you just you just have a vague idea of such and such person and you want to know where exactly in the united states [mn] 

276.04 276.99 A: yeah 

276.45 280.94 B: and then you just do a people search wow that's that's that's wonderful really 

280.31 284.90 A: yeah y- you know there's ways you can look up uh phone numbers on line and to tell you 

284.79 285.71 B: yeah 

285.03 288.49 A: uh who who it is when they last used this 

287.74 295.43 B: absolutely absolutely and i think most of your email correspondences with your professors and your fellow students and everything 

295.16 296.10 A: mhm 

295.30 302.96 B: i think it just happens you know on the internet because y- it's not feasible to actually practically meet everybody all the time to do your 

303.19 304.08 B: you know 

303.89 305.01 A: yeah 

304.35 316.03 B: to get together and do work so most of it happens i think on line everything is just you know you divide your work on line and then you just just send your files and that's it i mean what do you think about that 

315.36 317.55 A: yeah i you know i i think so 

317.62 321.30 B: well how many how many calls have you done in this special study [laughter] 

320.76 323.87 A: uh one the first one this is my first one 

321.65 322.61 B: really 

323.31 325.94 B: oh really [laughter] how's it going 

325.79 327.51 A: uh decent 

326.80 329.49 B: [laughter] where did you hear about this 

329.21 333.19 A: uh actually um my mother uh through the computer 

332.78 335.84 B: oh really again see [laughter] 

333.31 337.26 A: yeah she she lives she lives out of state so 

336.21 337.31 B: okay 

338.03 342.67 A: she had um hooked me up through it and i f- filled out all the information 

338.06 338.98 B: oh 

342.13 343.22 B: okay 

343.40 355.50 B: okay because see again i i i learnt about this study from from the internet too you know and then see that's a great thing otherwise the world becomes so small with computers and the internet what do you think 

349.18 350.14 A: okay 

355.35 360.88 A: um yeah i i think it probably would uh the communication wouldn't be as well 

358.44 359.22 B: (( [mn] )) 

360.33 368.49 B: exactly i mean it's just wonderful see where are you and where am i and both of us know about the same study just through the computers and internet 

368.08 369.54 A: mhm mhm 

368.77 374.96 B: so i mean i i i personally cannot imagine what our lives would be without computers i 

374.10 375.14 A: uh 

375.21 377.81 A: yeah i i couldn't either like 

375.77 376.58 B: (( don't [mn] )) 

376.78 385.67 B: yeah but even if it's games or it's just to pass your time free time there's just there's just ample ample entertainment [noise] [laughter] 

381.29 382.08 A: well 

385.37 398.43 A: i yeah i can remember as a child as a little child my mother always having a computer and it was huge you know and it wasn't nearly you know twenty years ago wasn't nearly as what it is today 

386.05 387.23 B: (( yes so )) 

392.04 393.06 B: i know 

396.68 397.63 B: mhm 

398.00 401.50 B: right but still you needed it then too yeah 

400.12 401.92 A: yeah exactly 

401.57 406.39 B: so you can imagine now how how much more hooked and how much more dependent we are now 

406.00 407.43 A: mhm mhm 

406.69 419.94 B: yes so it just goes like that and i mean i've ordered uh we had our world cup cricket matches going on so i ordered them all on the internet and i was sitting home and watching them you know instead of paying for the satellite and instead of paying for the you know 

415.90 416.91 A: really 

419.70 421.14 A: mhm 

420.28 423.33 B: yeah and that was it it was a whole lot cheaper 

423.63 432.90 B: so i guess it's it's such an integral part well they want us to link computers only to education but i think i don't know it's just so important in every aspect [laughter] mhm 

431.52 435.00 A: well i mean ev- when you go on the computer anyways um [mn] 

435.04 437.62 A: aren't you pretty much just educating yourself 

436.93 439.40 B: i think so too absolutely 

438.04 440.01 A: no matter what you do on it 

439.45 446.33 B: absolutely because there's everything new that you i mean every time you you log in there's there's something new that you learn every time you know 

445.95 447.74 A: mhm 

446.73 451.03 B: about some place somewhere about some company somewhere or just anything 

451.12 457.15 B: my my husband's doing his job search these days and it's all it's all on monster trak and you know 

456.79 457.98 A: mhm 

457.33 461.47 B: he hasn't been anybody he hasn't gone personally and submitted his resume anywhere 

461.15 462.32 A: mhm 

461.64 466.37 B: so i think it's it's just a great thing to have happened to us and we are just lucky [laughter] 

466.30 469.39 A: oh yeah oh yeah i totally agree with that 

468.45 471.89 B: yeah [mn] we're luckier than our parents were because they had to 

472.19 476.86 B: they didn't have so much uh you know advantage and so much of this thing so 

474.91 475.88 A: mhm 

476.89 485.11 B: and um i definitely think but i also think though that uh not only does it kind of make make life easier for us 

485.14 492.20 B: at times it also has a potential to you know kind of mm lead us astray 

492.25 493.37 A: (( ah )) 

492.55 497.66 B: because of [mn] you know like sites pornography and stuff like that 

497.06 504.62 A: ye- yeah um well i think that you know wherever you go um [mn] you know especially pornography on the internet 

504.15 505.57 B: mhm 

504.65 508.43 A: wha- what i do think though uh i think they should have um 

508.49 512.40 A: stricter regulations on something like that 

511.67 515.79 B: i'm sure parents do exercise that when they have small kids at home 

516.37 520.10 A: um because i know it's it's pretty easy to get on those sites too 

519.43 521.07 B: yeah yeah 

521.61 533.08 B: i know that i mean you can just you can pay a measly amount and just subscribe to you know regular stuff and all that well as far as that is concerned i guess [mn] it's a little you know dicey as to whether 

532.91 547.91 B: you know everybody should have access and how how how properly should they use it but other than that i think i've only seen good in computers and internet i mean other than that i don't think it it it affects us you know in a bad way or anything 

547.78 549.03 A: yeah 

548.41 554.77 B: yeah i mean [mn] people i think people have the choice to either do it or not do it 

555.11 559.48 A: yeah uh you know i think they i don't know uh you know that's the iffy question 

559.10 568.05 B: yeah i mean we shouldn't blame it on internet or the computer so much but people should exercise their own kind of choice you know whether they want to get into that kind of stuff or not so 

567.55 569.81 A: yeah i mean knowing right from wrong 

569.26 577.52 B: yeah [mn] so it's it's [mn] all in all i would i would definitely support the computer and favorable um you know 

577.30 579.22 A: yeah i definitely would too 

578.79 590.35 B: yeah because it it i don't know if today you tell me even to spend probably twenty four hours i would feel wow in spite of the television in spite of the newspapers i'm still kind of you know i'm missing something i'm you know 

590.04 591.07 A: mhm 

590.44 595.51 B: it's it's so normal for you to just just log in and check stuff on line and 

594.85 597.35 A: new- newspapers from around the world 

597.13 599.95 B: yeah exactly like my home country 

597.66 598.77 A: um
