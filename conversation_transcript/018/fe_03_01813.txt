0.58 2.47 A: hi my name is carol 

2.03 5.61 B: uh this is mary how how are you doing 

3.54 4.65 A: hi mary 

5.05 8.36 A: fine this is the strangest thing have you done one of these calls before 

7.95 9.86 B: uh yes i've done two of them 

9.61 14.34 A: oh well this is just the weirdest thing i've been around but okay here we go 

13.24 21.34 B: [laughter] uh matter of fact i've missed i don't know how many phone calls uh i think i've missed like four or five this week already [laughter] 

20.86 25.39 A: oh this is so interesting ah well anyway so where are you today 

24.95 26.62 B: in mississippi 

26.14 28.11 A: oh i'm in texas so 

27.40 32.14 B: oh that's who i spoke with the last time i talked a lady in texas 

31.49 32.80 A: (( uh-huh fine )) 

32.38 34.75 B: she was right out of houston texas [mn] 

33.98 40.93 A: oh okay well i'm out of dallas so that's pretty cool whatever we are doing it for i guess it's some graduate school study or something 

37.17 38.26 B: oh 

39.97 43.37 B: right it's a linguistics study i think 

42.32 44.15 A: yeah oh okay 

43.96 46.90 B: i didn't quite understand what the question was oh 

46.04 50.43 A: it was computers and education do they help or hurt education 

50.15 51.46 B: okay 

50.85 54.23 A: that was my understanding of the subject so 

53.14 54.20 B: okay 

54.42 57.81 A: (( uh you know i don't do you have kids in school )) 

57.80 64.29 B: ah well we home school and we use computers so i would say they're quite handy [laughter] 

61.32 63.54 A: oh great 

63.76 64.97 A: [laughter] 

64.65 75.65 B: uh now i don't think that it should just be totally computers i mean you know i think they need other things beside computers but in the world we live in now i believe computers are very important 

71.80 73.50 A: mhm 

76.12 88.52 A: oh i do too i you know my daughter i have one daughter who is twenty one and she's mentally handicapped and i have another one who is in a school for kids with learning differences and and um 

77.03 77.83 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

88.63 92.84 A: [mn] you know but it she's in high school she's freshman in high school and 

92.66 103.64 A: they really rely i think too much on the internet for like research i don't think they are telling kids enough that a lot of what you find on the internet may or may not be true 

103.40 104.53 B: yeah 

103.90 115.84 A: you know and that you really have to go back and and do careful research but they're only freshmen so i guess that you know right now they're trying to teach them how to use the resource as opposed to 

115.94 116.85 A: (( um )) 

117.58 121.60 A: worrying all about you know dotting all the is and crossing all the ts 

121.36 131.12 B: well i know my son he is in his first year in college uh at mississippi state and i know he doesn't do any research except for on the internet for all of his papers and things 

124.03 125.15 A: mhm 

130.23 131.26 A: (( mm )) 

131.06 137.88 B: uh sometimes you wonder eh you know what's wrong with books [laughter] ah the library [laughter] 

137.24 147.65 A: [sigh] well now he probably has access though on line access to all the mississippi ah library yeah yeah but you're right 

142.87 154.20 B: probably so [laughter] and it might be it might be the same difference but i think it's still good to know how to go and look into a book you know how to find things in a library 

154.05 159.54 A: well absolutely because what you find on the internet nine times out of ten is pretty surface level stuff 

159.21 160.91 B: yeah that's true 

159.77 173.28 A: you know and and if you're ever wanting to get your phd or anything like that not that i have one but you know you're going to be having to go back and do research from orig- even original sources you know so 

166.45 167.10 B: (( [laughter] )) 

171.60 172.73 B: yeah 

173.45 174.79 A: are we teaching them 

175.09 181.41 A: [mn] from that perspective of research i do think that we are too reliant on just flipping the internet out there 

181.02 190.28 B: yeah there's another thing i think about computers too i know uh well when mine were in public school which they've been out of public school for six years i have four children 

190.34 192.26 B: and uh they're 

192.10 198.52 B: my youngest is ten and then i have one thirteen and fifteen and then the like i said the one he's he'll be twenty in october 

198.32 207.63 B: and he's in college but before they ever got out of public school at least the older ones uh they got to the point where they didn't even write anything it was all you know um 

207.72 217.50 B: typed on the computer and i said i don't know if that's teaching them like good handwriting skills and uh things like that because they were not required to do any writing you know 

208.97 210.27 A: mhm 

217.80 220.38 B: here in our school system so 

219.23 233.62 A: well and with the school that my daughter goes to that's the uh um school for kids with learning differences a lot of those kids have issues with [mn] processing information through their brain and onto paper 

233.63 246.72 A: it's a lot easier for them just physically because of the physicality i don't know what it is but it's a lot easier for them to sit and type a coherent sentence than it is for them to write a coherent sentence 

246.52 247.38 B: mm 

246.86 261.57 A: and the school recommends these little computers that are more or less just word processors and for some of the kids they require that they have them and carry them to class to take notes on because they have such issues 

261.70 263.60 A: with translating 

263.69 265.39 A: what they've done 

265.67 270.06 A: so in that case the school just considers computers to be invaluable 

269.78 270.68 B: mm 

270.40 284.02 A: and uh i know i'm i sat down when i'm a journalist or i used to be [laughter] before i went into real business and i sat down when i was seven years old and typed my first story and i've never been able to do anything except on a typewriter 

281.80 282.58 B: [laughter] 

284.23 285.43 B: (( oh me )) 

284.34 288.10 A: you know so it was uh i [mn] 

288.17 295.42 A: i kind of agree with you but i don't think in today's world it's you don't need to you don't need to [laughter] write any more 

293.34 294.80 B: yeah if the 

294.97 298.79 B: i guess it's getting to be a lost art maybe [laughter] 

297.31 308.77 A: yeah well the other thing i've been impressed with too is in my daughter's school they're not only using the computers but they're doing a lot of programming learn- learning and they're doing they're learning 

306.41 307.60 B: yeah 

309.96 317.49 A: they've been through excel they've been through word they've been through uh microsoft um whatever the database program is 

317.66 323.08 A: and uh they've also learned h._t._m._l. language and written their own web sites 

323.10 330.61 A: and so i'm i'm real impressed with what they're doing i hope that there's advanced classes because she's doing really well in it 

324.98 326.12 B: yeah 

329.80 333.74 B: yeah well my son is in computer engineering in school so 

333.04 334.27 A: mhm 

333.78 340.25 B: he does a lot of that type thing plus more uh he's way above my head i'm afraid [laughter] 

334.67 338.00 A: yeah yeah 

338.85 340.35 A: [sigh] exactly 

340.34 354.67 A: yeah but uh you know i i think in a lot of ways yeah back to the topic they are definitely helping because i number one i think they make learning more fun for the kids i mean it's a whole lot more fun to create a project and go cut and paste pictures and 

354.65 359.06 A: sometimes i think though they get so involved in the project that they miss the point 

359.04 360.24 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

359.69 372.22 A: at least that's what i've noticed with my daughter and i'm like why are you doing this and why are you finding this and what what are you trying to communicate here she'll go i don't know i'm just cutting and pasting stuff [laughter] 

368.35 374.47 B: oh goodness [laughter] oh well maybe somewhere they're learning something 

373.10 385.88 A: [sigh] i yeah i guess [laughter] whys are tough for kids with uh with a._d._d. and other issues so you know they're like why i don't know why i just want the grades let me out of here [laughter] 

380.15 381.28 B: yeah 

382.63 383.50 B: [laughter] 

384.73 386.81 B: (( [laughter] oh me )) 

387.60 394.85 A: but uh i don't know [mn] you know so i'm i'm impressed too like they were telling me that my older daughter 

395.06 396.25 A: (( um )) 

396.32 403.13 A: she just landed a job at walmart and they have a pretty com- uh comprehensive computer based learning program 

403.18 405.75 A: for people who work at walmart apparently 

405.67 419.34 A: i guess you have to learn the history of the store and the procedures and the rules and she's been making hundreds on her test they've been giving on the computer so i think for kids who are challenged they're just wonderful 

419.37 425.19 B: mm i wouldn't have thought about that being at walmart like that but you just don't ever know do you [noise] 

419.95 421.04 A: really 

422.63 423.85 A: i know 

424.34 430.56 A: everybody you have to do it now you know you can't get by without it what kind of school do you have 

430.39 436.48 B: well we go by the uh abecker program most of it anyway are you familiar with that 

435.52 437.03 A: no uh-uh 

436.53 441.73 B: well it's in uh they have a college uh pensacola christian academy 

441.39 442.15 A: (( ah )) 

441.80 453.56 B: and uh they do a home school program from there plus we do a lot of extra stuff too that they're interested in specifically so it works out real nicely for us 

444.73 445.87 A: i see 

454.51 456.26 A: so you have a home school there 

456.12 466.65 B: ahah we do mhm our school system here got really bad uh i don't know we had there was a lot of um problems with problem children 

457.29 458.24 A: i see 

466.59 481.01 B: and [mn] every time i'd go of course my oldest son he was very intelligent and h- he you know he'd get through of what they were doing and the teacher would tell me well you're going to have to bring him something to do you're going to have to find something for him to do 

481.09 493.79 B: and i got to thinking about it because this kept on happening and also my second daughter also because they were having so many problems with other children like as far as discipline problems and you know keeping them caught up 

493.58 499.32 B: and i got to thinking well if i'm going to have to find something for them to do i might as well do it myself [mn] 

499.33 500.86 A: oh yeah 

499.91 500.80 B: (( so )) 

500.77 508.80 B: uh we ended up home schooling and it's like i said so far it's worked out real nicely you know we had no problem him getting into college or anything you know 

507.94 509.42 A: mhm 

508.61 520.56 B: i know that was a big thing for uh a lot of our friends and stuff saying well how will he ever get into college you know but i mean college don't care you know as long as you do well on your a._c._t. test they don't care 

520.18 526.99 A: mhm mhm well now i know here in dallas because we live in such a big town there are a lot of um 

527.26 527.97 A: uh 

527.94 533.55 A: social activities and and sports and things like that also for kids who are home schooled so 

533.05 534.00 B: yeah 

533.37 543.14 A: you do have uh events and things enrichment i guess they would call it places that you can take them i mean i would never be able to sit down and teach my own kids 

541.64 542.47 B: [laughter] 

543.24 546.40 B: well you think that but you probably could [laughter] 

543.47 544.41 A: ever 

545.74 547.41 A: no no no no 

546.45 547.94 B: [laughter] 

547.63 552.77 A: no not my kids uh-huh and i have the patience um not the patience so 

549.23 550.57 B: oh 

552.16 557.89 B: well they at at times mine have gotten you know uh i don't know 

557.86 567.17 B: it's kind of like y- you have to push but overall i don't have to because they know what the alternative is and they were not happy in the school system 

566.41 567.68 A: (( oh okay )) 

567.24 577.67 B: and so you know they know the alternative and y- generally they will sit down on their own and i didn't even have to say okay this is school time you know it's just they sit down and they you know they have 

575.15 576.32 A: yeah 

577.50 583.53 B: certain things that they you know like we have a schedule and as long as they meet that schedule you know 

580.10 581.39 A: mhm 

583.67 586.91 B: um it's okay but usually they're way ahead you know 

586.14 589.41 A: ah yeah well that's great that's just wonderful 

589.58 592.15 A: yeah so i don't know i um 

593.36 598.11 A: so are you do you have do you fight over the computer or do you have just one for example 

596.97 599.89 B: well we have three computers so um 

598.57 599.87 A: okay
