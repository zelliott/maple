21.92 26.82 A: [laughter] and you're doing this right now you're just getting home from work and you are doing this 

24.69 25.55 B: huh 

25.97 34.46 B: well i mean i've been home from work i stopped over there and you know that type of stuff i left work early i actually left there three thirty so i can't claim i was working all day 

31.90 33.05 A: oh gotcha 

34.19 36.15 A: oof not good [mn] 

36.11 39.76 B: well i um i think computers are great in education i think 

39.88 50.21 B: to me it is amazing the stuff that they have that they didn't have when i was in school i mean i didn't even have a mandatory computer class when i was in high school or college i mean it's just amazing the stuff that they do [lipsmack] 

46.25 47.56 A: absolutely 

49.61 50.64 A: oh i know 

50.95 60.47 A: we have an eleven year old and she is one with the internet i swear to god she she uses it for every single thing you can possibly imagine 

60.42 61.59 B: yeah i mean 

60.90 66.18 A: and not just for chatting and stuff like that with her friends pretty much like educational stuff also 

65.88 79.64 B: i mean you find out so much stuff i mean from surfing the internet i mean any topic that you want to you you you need i mean it's like i want to look this up you just go on the internet i mean that's the great solution to all life's problems i want to know about this oh i'll go on the internet i love 

76.15 77.33 A: (( exactly it's )) 

78.92 83.38 A: almost it's almost scary how much information is really at your fingertips 

81.88 96.68 B: it [mn] yeah i looked myself up in google and i actually came up that was a little [laughter] that was a little weird 'cause i had been in a couple a couple of articles a couple of newspaper articles stuff like that and i actually had like a list of things that were actually me 

86.81 88.27 A: that's pretty weird 

88.91 90.02 A: that is weird 

92.78 93.63 A: (( ahah )) 

96.31 97.34 A: is that crazy 

96.50 97.57 B: you know 

97.42 98.50 A: that's nuts 

98.80 111.27 A: i know and like our daughter is actually she's she's into art and she does a lot of ah things with with ah with music and stuff like that and just the downloading of the music and just the ah 

111.17 122.47 A: just the at your fingertips access to all different kinds of information or what she needs for school stuff that we never even thought could be possible i mean they're doing it like it is second nature to them 

118.38 119.75 B: i know how 

121.99 136.09 B: i i know i mean it's it's really great i mean you have access to so much stuff that i can't imagine how long it would take you to compile it by hand i mean research in the library like do we that stuff it's like basically archaic i mean like [laughter] i don't even see the point of teaching anybody that kind of stuff any more 

127.26 128.17 A: mhm 

133.06 133.94 A: i know 

135.48 142.46 A: and i think that that's probably the drawback 'cause i i see the drawback in being that she cannot spell worth a lick 

142.60 148.37 A: you know if it wasn't for spell check she would be the worst speller that there was on the planet 

148.22 158.54 A: because she just there is no reason there's no encouragement to to want to try to spell a word correctly you know or really want to try to um 

158.94 167.34 A: [mn] look for other words in a in a thesaurus in a book it is just pretty much right there you can just click on a button and it pulls up a thesaurus or it pulls up a spell check 

164.22 169.81 B: yeah it's got its own dictionary the whole nice stuff that we never had when we [laughter] were at school 

169.04 170.43 A: yeah yeah 

169.82 171.68 B: never had stuff like that 

171.26 180.69 A: yeah and i complain to her about it all the time but i i see myself doing it too i mean i'm a i'm a bad speller to begin with and now spell check there is no reason to even 

181.25 185.38 A: attempt to spell a word correctly i mean you pretty much let the computer do it 

185.31 187.41 B: (( yeah it is )) 

185.74 187.73 A: that's the drawback i guess 

187.20 190.41 B: yeah i i'm i'm a good speller but i type 

190.17 196.37 B: really fast and then i say why do i have to go back over the words because you know they'll pick them up i don't have to worry about it because they'll correct me 

194.57 197.05 A: exactly exactly 

196.15 205.21 B: and that is the thing and i'm always like oh they'll correct me so i don't have to worry about that i mean i'll see oh it's spelt wrong but i'm just going to keep typing and then in the end it will check everything for me and and then i'll be fine 

201.64 202.40 A: right 

203.29 204.24 A: i know 

204.99 216.00 A: i guess it was like i guess the same concept was when the calculator was invented you know it kind of took the the the brain power out of doing math in your head it was pretty much left it up to a computer to do it 

209.44 211.14 B: yeah 

216.10 217.28 A: now it's 

216.16 228.78 B: yeah i mean because i know we used them for some things in high school but we didn't use them for everything like my boyfriend was like he's older than i am he was telling me he actually had a slide rule i said okay come on already [laughter] like i really didn't believe him but he told me he did 

220.84 222.11 A: calculators you mean 

228.33 229.55 A: [laughter] 

228.62 232.04 B: i'm like you've got to be joking [laughter] 

230.55 232.44 A: i know it's crazy 

231.88 241.59 B: i had like a solar scientific calculator you know for like calculus and stuff like that i mean you had to have a calculator it's not math you can do in your head it's not like algebra and stuff we had to do that in our heads 

237.21 238.34 A: oh absolutely 

238.85 239.78 A: mhm 

241.06 241.95 A: right 

241.38 247.37 B: you know totally had to do that in your heads s._a._t.s there's no calculators and things like that i think they use them now for s._a._t.s 

244.31 245.28 A: mhm 

247.08 248.85 A: they do actually yeah okay 

248.52 255.90 B: because my brother he just well he he just is going to university of delaware so he just got through with the whole college process 

255.94 262.00 B: and s._a._t.s and all that type of stuff but yeah i mean we didn't have those things you had to do all the math in your head 

261.57 271.04 A: oh yeah and i remember i i'm actually a c._p._a. so i sat for my c._p._a. exam about six years ago b- what am i saying about seven years ago probably now 

271.00 277.54 A: and you weren't allowed to use calculators back then but now ev- everyone going through it is allowed to use calculators and 

277.62 279.11 B: oh my god 

278.26 282.70 A: as part of the as part of the exam and that's that was unheard of back then 

282.85 290.41 A: so it's pretty much taking over our lives you know it's either you you either get on the bus and learn how to use it or you get left behind basically 

289.58 303.34 B: i know i know like my mother like i mean she's a masters degree but like we just got her up to like internet like she'll send me emails from work [laughter] forward emails and all that type of stuff and i went and i put people in her address book for her last time i was at her office you know 

298.37 299.35 A: mhm 

303.62 317.40 B: so yo- you don't really have any choice you know i mean you have to i mean email people expect like email you don't have email like people think something is wrong you don't have a computer you don't have d._s._l. you don't have a scanner you don't have a color printer [laughter] is there something wrong with you [laughter] 

305.67 306.72 A: (( mhm right )) 

311.62 312.95 A: (( yeah exactly )) 

313.70 314.86 A: [laughter] 

314.89 321.96 A: and to say yeah and to say it's either good and bad i mean there is really there is nothing you can do to stop it [noise] you know 

321.77 332.69 A: so you know it's either you have to adapt to it or get left behind and kids that are you know you laugh about it but i mean they're they're teaching kids how to use computers in kindergarten nowadays 

331.75 339.99 B: oh my sister teaches kindergarten and they have a computer in the room [laughter] i just visited her classroom two weeks ago and they have computers in the room 

334.46 335.71 A: absolutely 

339.40 341.06 A: that's crazy 

340.46 341.58 B: you know 

340.82 352.80 A: i mean it's kind i guess it's a double-edged sword because you know if you are so reliant on computers all the time then really where i mean what's wh- wh- what's the drawback from a child 

352.63 362.00 A: that is actually going to are they actually going to have to learn anything or are they just going to solely rely on that computer their whole life to to do things for them 

359.76 364.74 B: like i mean like skills like oh typing i mean i actually had typing at high school [laughter] i mean 

363.79 365.13 A: mhm 

364.67 370.33 B: you know nobody would teach nobody would have that any more i mean it is something that you don't even need i mean you actually had to like 

365.18 366.07 A: oh yeah 

367.77 368.52 A: right 

370.09 380.62 B: type everything correctly or go back with the little correction like thing back up and like type over the letters to correct your letters i mean we didn't even have like stuff like correction you know the automatic correction stuff we had to do it manually 

379.19 380.11 A: mhm 

380.18 383.78 A: oh i know i i i actually work for work for an i._t. company 

384.03 387.46 A: and we are developing voice recognition typewriters now 

387.39 388.70 B: (( yeah )) 

387.54 389.67 A: so really it's only you know 

389.86 403.57 A: five years from now ten years from now you're not even going to have to know how to type you just basically nee- need to talk into a keyboard and it will just translate what what what you're saying into text so i mean it's it's just getting unbelievable 

398.63 399.63 B: yeah 

403.26 409.37 B: yeah and i mean there like you know the pictures and you know the scanners and like you know the video and all that stuff i'm thinking 

408.39 409.20 A: (( yep )) 

409.45 412.69 B: it's it's it's moving along quickly 

411.91 417.32 A: absolutely and it's one of those things that if you know you just can't stop it it's it's like a moving train you know 

417.55 426.49 A: you have to just allow your kids to to or you have to encourage your kids to be a part of it because if they don't it's it's almost like they will get left behind 

425.92 434.56 B: yeah i mean like i mean imagine like parents who don't have a computer i mean like you'd think that was practically child abuse you don't have a computer [laughter] oh my god like everyone i know has a computer i mean 

432.29 433.35 A: oh yeah 

434.35 444.71 B: i can't i don't i can't really think of maybe only one or two people that don't have computers i mean oh my eighty year old uncle i mean like just really only a few people i mean everyone has a computer 

439.00 440.21 A: mhm 

442.51 443.87 A: oh yeah 

444.42 446.09 A: right i mean i know some 

444.73 449.19 B: i mean i don't have a home based business but i have a computer i mean you have to have one mhm 

448.38 459.41 A: absolutely absolutely and there's people that are probably in their forties now i guess forty maybe mid fifties that are that are just kind of like kind of that baby boomer age that i know my father 

459.45 465.91 A: he never knew one thing about a computer ever in his whole life until up up un- up until about five years ago 

465.86 474.74 A: and now he is like the biggest computer geek you will ever want to meet in your life because it was a new gadget that he was you know latched into that he just wanted to learn 

474.54 486.32 A: and now he's becoming you know he's doing the music and he's doing the teaching and he's doing the internet stuff it's un- it's unbelievable because i mean if i could see my father do it then that means everybody can do it because he's pretty much 

484.78 490.12 B: yeah i mean all you have to do is is you know if you want to try i mean it's like one of those type things like 

490.13 496.93 B: practice makes perfect you know i mean it's not like somebody can teach you it's like you can ask people for like help but the best way you learn is because you practice 

496.88 497.72 A: right 

497.03 511.97 B: you know you practice it i mean you buy it until you buy it yourself like i'm like well how did you like how did you learn and i'm like well i just tried to plug it here tried to plug it there installed it uninstalled it reinstalled it now it works you know you just true different things and you know i mean sometimes i ask for help but you know um 

506.07 507.18 A: exactly 

507.52 508.51 A: yeah 

509.85 511.37 A: right and 

512.17 526.40 B: like my computer is relatively new and my mouse like died so i went and got another i was like it's the mouse everything else works fine it's the mouse you know take the mouse out put the new mouse in new mouse works fine okay that was a mystery you know and you just try different things and that's how you learn 

524.88 525.87 A: right 

526.11 537.72 A: and it's funny because people i i think are associating that type of knowledge with with the school knowledge meaning you know well i took a computer class and now i learned how to you know i know how to use microsoft word 

537.52 549.24 A: so therefore i'm you know i'm a computer person well you still can't spell and yo- and you can't really write because you never really took a writing class to you know to learn how to write you may be a good writer 

547.13 551.02 B: yeah i mean that is definitely that is a different skill definitely 

550.54 558.13 A: you know and i think people associate computers now with learning as part of learning as part of their education you know 

554.51 555.17 B: (( mhm )) 

558.15 572.65 A: you have to be computer savvy in order to compete in today's world you know and and and to take that away from a child i mean it's just it's a it's a disservice to your child to not allow them to um be on the board with 

562.05 563.30 B: (( and )) 

572.59 574.82 A: everything that is going on with technology 

574.55 580.80 B: remember when we were in school you had like encyclopedias and you know like oh they had to be updated like every year like who in the world has encyclopedias any more 

577.47 578.82 A: oh yeah 

579.07 580.09 A: mhm 

580.34 582.42 A: absolutely i mean who uses 

580.88 585.70 B: i mean that's just like something like the way of the dinosaur [laughter] 

583.15 593.33 A: yeah i mean and who actually pulls out a dictionary nowadays i mean really everything is pretty much you know online you know there is really no reason to pull out a dictionary if you are writing a paper 

592.99 593.98 B: none 

593.47 599.89 A: you know there is no reason to do it [laughter] so i mean it has its goo- good things and bad things i would think 

594.03 595.33 B: mhm
