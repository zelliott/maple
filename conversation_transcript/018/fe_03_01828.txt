1.05 3.60 B: hi my name's shirley 

1.45 2.43 A: (( [mn] )) 

3.84 4.94 A: (( name is sarah )) 

5.27 6.82 B: ah what is your name 

7.01 7.95 A: sarah 

7.52 12.35 B: s- oh okay i didn't hear what you [laughter] said i'm sorry 

8.47 9.70 A: sorry [laughter] 

12.50 15.49 B: ah so i have you done this before 

15.25 16.87 A: yes i have have you 

15.58 16.91 B: have ya 

16.95 20.30 B: yeah i've done it ah before um 

16.99 17.55 A: (( yeah )) 

20.33 25.27 B: so i guess we're supposed talk about education and and computers right 

23.95 25.36 A: (( yes yes )) 

25.69 26.90 B: okay 

26.25 28.76 A: um i personally think that 

29.35 30.77 A: they need to be 

31.03 33.47 A: they do help education but not 

33.71 34.60 A: um 

34.83 36.94 A: not as directly i guess as ah 

37.21 41.54 A: like i don't like computer based classes i think they should only be used as an aid 

41.30 42.81 B: i think so too 

42.90 48.05 B: yeah because ah i think a lot of times they get on there and and they're not doing ah 

48.15 50.27 B: ah what they're supposed to be doing [laughter] 

49.90 50.96 A: yeah [laughter] 

50.47 54.17 B: [laughter] yeah i ah um 

54.28 61.19 B: i think if if they can regulate them a little more you know so that ah that's what they would just be doing 

61.35 66.85 B: it might be okay but i still think that they should like you said just use them as an aid [noise] [noise] 

66.70 76.80 A: yeah like a lot of my classes that i'm in right now um like we have homework assignments that are due online and that is like an easy way to get instant feedback on our homework so 

73.03 73.75 B: mm 

76.04 77.26 B: right 

76.96 80.87 A: that's nice but not i have also had a class that i've had to sit in 

80.99 83.72 A: while using computers and i don't think that that 

84.08 85.62 A: really helps either 

85.28 86.57 B: (( right )) 

85.67 88.08 A: generally to take to take a class 

87.97 90.34 B: right yeah because ah a 

90.43 100.22 B: lot of times um i've been in classes where ah we've used the computers you know a lot and ah it seems to me like um [mn] 

100.40 106.31 B: i don't know i seem to learn more [noise] ah when i'm not on a computer a lot you know 

106.16 107.01 A: mhm 

106.64 107.85 B: and um 

108.18 113.16 B: so it's just ah i guess it's the [noise] individual whoever ah 

113.93 116.56 B: some some it may be all right for 

116.74 118.90 A: (( w- ah what kind of classes have you taken mm )) 

118.63 126.91 B: ah i was doing for ah learning on c- learning computers and ah ah wanted to be ah a computer technology 

127.26 130.46 B: so i was i was doing that but ah a 

130.57 138.23 B: lot of times you need to just ah to be in the class itself doing and not on the computer doing 

138.28 139.28 A: mhm 

139.47 140.32 A: yeah 

140.12 141.79 B: so um 

141.84 142.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

142.55 144.16 B: i don't know um 

145.04 156.35 B: [noise] just like i said though it it could be for certain individuals if that's if that's it's according to i maybe what what classes they're they're using it for also 

156.14 156.96 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

157.11 161.86 A: like one of my classes i use the computer for was ah statistics course and so 

162.08 171.71 A: usually the um complex nature of statistics they ah you obviously needed to you know input stuff into the computer and it figured it out so for that class it was worthwhile 

164.76 166.23 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

170.90 172.77 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

172.30 175.37 A: i had a vocabulary class though that i had to do online 

175.02 176.12 B: (( [noise] )) 

175.55 178.19 A: and that was tough because it was dealing um 

178.48 182.32 A: you had to input like the prefixes suffixes and bases 

181.96 183.36 B: right 

183.06 186.60 A: and [mn] a lot of the times the book would have say two 

187.66 196.72 A: um bases but w- you know slightly different endings but the way the computer program was set up it wouldn't only take one of them so you had to you know 

189.67 192.37 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

192.49 194.01 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

196.53 206.19 B: yeah right yeah yeah that's that's true too you know where some of em [noise] are like that [noise] you know because i've had 

196.82 199.37 A: try one and then go back and try the other 

206.10 214.02 B: ah different classes and stuff that ah that we've had problems with where ah they they spend more time 

214.05 214.90 A: mhm 

214.58 222.34 B: because you to go to one and then you have to go back and go to the other one you know and it it takes up more time 

222.77 234.39 B: that to do it that way now and some things ah that i have done [mn] have been very helpful so um [lipsmack] it's just according i guess to what what you're really doing 

224.53 225.46 A: yeah 

234.66 248.86 B: ah whether it's it's a good idea or not but a lot of things that i that i do and ah like now i do a lot of things on the computer here at home and stuff and ah they're a lot of helpful 

237.37 238.57 A: mhm 

248.81 255.04 B: ah ideas i get from i do a lot of health work on on the computer and stuff and ah 

252.58 253.48 A: mhm

315.63 316.59 A: mhm 

318.77 322.62 A: yeah especially for for a major like that you really need to use them
