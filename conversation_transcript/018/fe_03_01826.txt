23.36 25.23 B: mhm i'm in college right now 

24.91 28.74 A: are you so you are working every day with computers probably [mn] 

28.42 31.84 B: yes i work every single day all day just about 

31.39 33.34 A: yeah and what do you think of them 

32.00 33.20 B: (( on computers )) 

33.60 44.52 B: um i think they're a great tool like especially for research and and i guess my school like on our library internet we have a database we can um get into like 

44.33 55.30 B: newspaper articles sociological journals like a lot like different types of um educational journals so for a lot of my research papers i can do a lot of my research from in my room online versus like 

49.99 50.72 A: (( ahah )) 

55.06 62.98 B: going to the library and even when i need to get books i can just search for my library catalogue in my room and write down the call number so 

62.91 63.91 A: oh my 

63.07 70.70 B: i guess it's beneficial [laughter] it's an asset i can do all that just from sitting at my computer while even just watching t._v. and still 

64.70 66.55 A: (( that's amazing [noise] [mn] )) 

70.74 78.08 B: you know and then w- maybe while i'm by the library going to class i can just pick up the books that i need you can place things on hold and 

78.18 83.74 B: basically you can do everything from a computer nowadays and i think it's great tool i i think it also can be like 

83.94 96.04 B: like hinder because a lot of people just use like um the internet recourses and and they don't even look at where they're getting the work from and you know that could be a problem um for the source of information 

89.09 89.81 A: (( ahah )) 

92.42 93.59 A: oh yeah 

95.98 102.11 B: how um credible it is but i try to use a mix source in books and internet you know 

102.35 104.68 B: teachers like that nowadays mhm 

102.55 103.11 A: (( [mn] )) 

104.04 109.90 A: when i was in school it was the early late eighties and early nineties and so computers were just beginning to 

110.13 116.36 A: to come to the surface in fact i i did a lot of my term papers on a typewriter on a typewriter in the library 

115.05 116.20 B: oh wow 

116.31 117.24 B: mhm 

116.69 117.96 A: so um 

118.38 125.88 A: to to you know hear what you can do is just amazing to me you know because i can't even conceptualize that although 

125.86 140.64 A: i have a computer in my home and connected to the internet on d._s._l. and you know i'm i'm on it all the time kind of thing and ah amazed that my almost four year old is ah very computer literate and and i think that ah 

136.12 136.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

137.69 139.03 B: (( [laughter] [noise] wow [noise] [noise] )) 

141.32 149.77 A: you know any more it's it's for educational value it's it's important it's not only important it's probably critical because if someone is not computer literate 

149.98 152.61 A: [mn] they're gonna be they're gonna fall behind 

153.08 156.83 A: you know even in elementary school any more so 

157.36 159.93 A: [mn] you know i i [sigh] 

160.08 163.60 A: i don't i have a hard time seeing it as a hindrance in education 

163.72 169.10 A: with the exemption like you said you know finding term papers online and um 

169.11 174.12 A: [lipsmack] wasting time probably but that's not you know that is more a personal thing than it's ah 

174.38 177.32 A: [mn] a problem with the education system 

177.15 189.15 B: mhm [noise] [noise] yeah and i think um it also is a helpful tool because even when like when i was in elementary school we had like you know computers were different then and that was like ten years ago but we still had little workshops on like 

189.12 198.90 B: in our computer labs and we do like spelling and there was like math games and stuff like that so that could be really helpful because i think it helps makes learning fun 

198.74 199.67 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

198.76 209.08 B: cause aside from the teacher doing the game you actually have like these little like cartoon characters on the computer like little cats and animated doings like oh yeah you got that question right so 

209.28 212.36 B: you know it kinda have those like um you 

212.87 219.62 B: know they have the handhelds that means you can do it at home you have that for computers also now and i think that's helpful for kids and i think 

219.76 228.59 B: learns um teachers i guess good computer ethics and it's not just for like to be on the internet but it also can be like like a learning tool at such a young age 

226.27 226.93 A: (( mm )) 

227.29 228.21 A: yeah 

228.42 231.88 A: yeah see for me i don't even know about that kind of stuff because i kind ah 

228.60 229.91 B: (( i think that's neat )) 

232.25 244.31 A: like i said when i was in college it was just beginning to come into it and my son is not there yet as far as learning all that kind of stuff so that'll be new and exciting and amazing to see for me 

244.50 245.61 B: yeah 

244.64 246.73 A: are are you studying computers 

246.96 247.94 B: excuse me 

247.54 250.01 A: are you studying computer science or 

249.59 253.92 B: no i'm i'm thinking about being a sociology major 

253.47 254.32 A: oh 

254.27 264.42 B: or maybe a psyche major or something like that but even in that like in the computers like even for a lot of my classes and we doing research and things like that like i said we do research on the internet 

264.31 275.31 B: and um we are have to do like use the programs to um make data tables and graphs and and it analyze our data for us like it compares variables and all those kinds of things 

273.94 274.77 A: right 

274.89 278.62 A: all those statistics st- statistical analysis 

278.26 287.30 B: yeah yeah all that stuff so like before we had to do it hand held you had to know if the computer can do everything for me [laughter] and then tells me like 

279.14 279.99 A: yeah 

284.91 287.67 A: (( i know [laughter] what distance is )) 

287.50 289.08 B: (( [laughter] )) 

290.45 301.17 A: this i mean looking at it so for me for me i had um my degree is in political science and i did have to take a st- statistics class i call it sadistics because i hated it so much but um 

297.59 298.77 B: mhm 

301.42 308.58 A: and it was all computer generated but again you know like i said it was just the beginning of of everything being computerized and so 

308.73 312.75 A: we had to do both i had to do it by hand and then i had to do it on the computer 

312.76 313.77 B: yeah 

312.96 317.33 A: and ah i can see definitely see the advantage to the computer 

317.66 325.19 B: and even though not just um p._c. computers like like even like calculators are computerized like you have the [mn] 

323.42 324.61 A: (( right )) 

325.20 329.23 B: the texas instrument like the t._i. eighty three and those kinds of things 

329.00 329.86 A: yeah 

329.18 341.76 B: and there's i think it's like a t._i. eighty nine that you know how teaches are always like oh show your work and you don't know what the answers like unless you're using the calculator well like the t._i. eighty nine actually like shows you the step by step process of 

341.50 342.70 A: oh my god 

341.76 346.33 B: so you can easily copy that and they still not doing the work themselves 

345.87 347.12 A: wow 

346.55 352.35 B: and like you can program like formulas and answers that the teacher tells you to memorize into your like 

352.58 358.14 B: um calculators so when you go to a test things you're supposed to like know outside you can go into 

358.18 362.93 B: a part of your calculator and the formulas are right there when they expect you 

361.56 363.46 A: do the professors know about this 

363.60 371.60 B: um yeah the teachers kn- it's funny because at my high school they they're the ones that told us about it they was like yeah we all know if you're cheating but [mn] 

368.58 369.34 A: (( ah )) 

371.48 382.83 B: yeah we're are telling you about it anyway [laughter] but it's like if we really wanted to catch anybody they had on there like we would get in trouble but they encourage it as a tool also because it's like yeah a lot of fun just to memorize it 

382.81 388.53 B: but i also thought it was like detrimental because i'm just like i know this stuff but they know it by heart now [laughter] 

387.74 388.64 A: yeah 

388.60 395.95 B: i know all that stuff and like with us it was just like oh what does it say on my calculator i forgot that formula [laughter] right so 

395.54 399.50 A: and did you say your your dorm room or your sorority is all um 

399.60 402.81 A: ah you you can get online there 

402.62 414.93 B: [noise] yeah [noise] um the way my my university works all the dorms all the off campus dorms are hooked up [noise] to like it's like a d._s._l. thing you know we all get free internet um access [mn] if you have a computer in your room 

415.53 418.44 B: like so i have a laptop but i can just 

417.02 418.57 A: you have to bring it with you 

418.52 421.96 B: yeah but there's um also in the dorm there's um 

419.04 419.87 A: yeah 

421.83 430.92 B: there's computer labs so even if you don't have a computer you can go to computer lab and everyone has a password and things and the email everyone can have an email account 

425.43 426.26 A: oh 

430.79 437.98 B: so you know that access is right there for free or i guess it is part of our tuition because they charge like a technology fee [noise] but 

436.76 437.83 A: right 

438.27 444.34 B: all of this is at my fingertips because i can just really sit in my room and do all my homework and research and papers and things like that 

444.60 448.74 B: and [noise] like not go anywhere but to class [laughter] so 

446.88 448.26 A: wow 

448.73 450.02 A: that's amazing [noise] 

448.79 451.52 B: that's actually helpful and that's a good tool and i think 

451.95 458.25 B: i think we have that internet access because they they know it's such an tool but there is a lot of problems with it because people download like 

458.38 459.84 B: (( we also have like )) 

459.78 472.35 B: tech- um other um problems with people like downloading from the internet so some people download like pornography [noise] or movies or music which are all copyrighted so at the school like 

466.20 466.96 A: (( mhm )) 

468.14 469.27 A: (( yeah )) 

472.26 486.57 B: i think they get well depending on what you um [lipsmack] download it sends things like the school technology office and if they come to your room and they see on there you can get in trouble some people there's there's some cases at college that people have got suspended from it 

486.26 487.31 A: yeah 

486.74 498.60 B: and they don't know how to limit their access which is kinda a crying shame that you want to do those things but a lot of people it's kinda things they're really not look at it and they get in trouble so i guess it could be a downfall of it 

496.88 497.49 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

498.17 506.17 A: well you can download like cazar or well of course not any more but napster and stuff like that onto the computer and then use the university the university's server 

502.78 503.88 B: yeah 

504.62 505.72 B: mhm 

506.11 520.63 B: yeah wow they use it like because all because that is where you get your internet access from like i don't think you can have an alternate internet access here maybe um maybe through a phone line probably but not through the like a cable network which is much much faster 

513.50 515.20 A: oh yeah 

516.06 516.80 A: (( ahah )) 

520.30 521.06 A: (( ahah oh )) 

520.61 527.53 B: and like even like i have one class where um like my homework is posted online and i can get um 

527.91 534.03 B: copy on my computer screen lectures you can download the lecture notes on off line it's called like 

533.20 534.30 A: my god 

534.47 535.39 B: (( so )) 

535.54 537.51 B: (( um i don't know if you can actually )) 

537.65 542.60 B: um have a class online like the teacher and we all sit in our rooms like on the computer but 

542.73 547.03 B: like homework assignments or we can hand in homework assignments through the internet 

546.92 560.41 B: and everything like that even jobs nowadays you can you don't even have an interview or bring in your resume and cover letter like it's just like oh send it to my email [laughter] and it is just like really just based on you whatever you wrote without them even seeing you and to like 

555.48 556.73 A: (( [noise] wow )) 

560.50 570.85 B: to actually want you to come in and maybe or like i even got hired one time just from being i'm like they don't even know what i look like [laughter] or i could be a child who stole like my big sister's resume cover letter 

566.28 567.80 A: [laughter] 

569.26 570.78 A: [laughter] 

571.40 573.38 B: but so that's 

573.35 576.78 A: that's amazing well then it sounds like it's a very beneficial tool 

573.46 574.71 B: (( wow crazy )) 

576.69 577.78 B: (( yeah )) 

577.14 579.32 A: computers i mean ah 

578.27 580.74 B: it's really just what you do with it 

580.64 582.02 A: that's amazing 

582.78 585.80 A: [lipsmack] well i look forward to to ah 

585.41 587.02 B: [noise] 

587.13 590.28 A: exploring that more when my son gets into school 

590.18 591.25 B: yeah
