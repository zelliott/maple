5.52 10.03 A: hi jennifer i'm i live in florida 

6.46 7.58 B: hi 

9.10 10.80 B: and i'm in virginia 

10.70 20.23 A: oh nice speaking with you i i i guess the topic is family what it means to us [noise] you want to start or do you want me to start 

12.26 13.97 B: (( good to talk to talk to you )) 

19.13 21.14 B: (( um go ahead [laughter] )) 

20.66 22.80 A: okay [laughter] um 

22.93 29.08 A: to me let's see ah family is a group of people who are very supportive of one another 

29.11 31.50 A: um who are there when 

31.51 43.71 A: you need to talk to somebody or a pat on the back or congratulations or a pick me up when you seem to have tripped and fallen on your face um i think it's someone to 

43.66 46.86 A: a group of people that that um share 

47.03 49.59 A: um um i think we share everything 

49.17 50.56 B: [noise] yeah 

49.80 52.84 A: i don't think there's anything that you don't share really 

51.71 58.28 B: (( [laughter] sometimes you can't help but share [laughter] )) 

53.70 59.41 A: [laughter] tha- that is very true that is very true 

58.76 60.49 B: [laughter] 

60.20 65.16 A: um i think there's just different components to a family um 

65.85 78.68 A: some families are single parents and some families have multiple parents ah with with divorces that you know you'll have two sets of moms and two sets of dads 

78.98 82.92 A: so i would consider that's an extended family [noise] 

82.07 83.41 B: (( mhm yes )) 

83.41 91.91 A: and then you've got sometimes you're in for the adopted family that um you pick up along the way you know but 

91.79 100.74 A: um someone that lives next door becomes an like an adopted grandparent or something like that i think i think that kind constitutes a family member 

97.25 98.17 B: right 

100.76 101.32 A: (( [noise] )) 

100.78 103.01 B: right um [lipsmack] 

103.61 110.83 B: to me family is ah i first first of all i think about my own family and 

110.77 121.49 B: think about really family causes me the most happiness and the most str- stress [laughter] of everything in my life you know family causes me the most happiness the most stress 

116.27 117.46 A: [laughter] 

121.34 122.23 A: yeah 

122.25 127.16 B: and so it's like a rollercoaster of emotions and um 

127.28 132.08 B: that's how i identify myself first and foremost as a mom and a wife 

131.94 133.04 A: mhm 

132.04 144.48 B: and so to me family is the most important thing in my life um and then i guess next i think when i think about family next i go to like my mom and my dad that's that family 

144.15 145.43 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

144.64 146.36 B: and um 

147.35 160.27 B: think about the support that they all give me i'm i'm more supportive towards my family that i live in the hou- you know my family with my kids i'm more of the support one and then my parents and sisters give me lots of support 

160.40 161.88 B: so it kind of 

162.36 176.38 B: it's kind of a ah we fall back on each other becau- when i get worn out from supporting this family [laughter] they help me you know build my build me back up and help me so i can be strong and help my family um 

168.52 169.63 A: yeah 

170.00 170.69 A: yeah 

176.31 178.15 A: it's a back up system 

177.65 181.59 B: [lipsmack] mhm yeah they really are and um [lipsmack] 

182.68 184.66 B: (( [sigh] what else ah )) 

185.66 190.58 B: and you know along the same lines with bef- what i was saying before you know they 

192.54 194.66 B: well i guess you know there's nothing 

195.41 198.79 B: well i guess that would be the same thing as i was saying before um 

198.96 205.64 A: i don't think in in a family situation um that there's anything that's too big or too little 

205.73 210.89 A: too silly or too serious that can't be addressed as a family unit 

210.56 211.82 B: right 

211.36 212.62 A: (( [noise] um )) 

212.53 221.17 B: that's just somebody you can be yourself you can always be yourself around your family and they're not going to think ah that you're you know 

212.76 213.55 A: i 

217.19 218.53 A: right 

221.53 224.92 B: anything negative usually about you and 

225.11 228.29 B: just accept you for who you are and 

227.28 234.04 A: i also think you can you can you can make additions to your family of course thi- it wouldn't be a blood relation but 

233.92 243.36 A: sometimes you make friendships with people that are so close that they almost become brothers and sisters to you or or moms and dads to you 

243.04 243.97 B: right 

243.31 250.29 A: [noise] and and that that in itself would constitute a form of a family um like i said earlier 

250.07 262.39 A: not necessarily a blood family a blood line but a family nonetheless like if you belong to a spiritual group whether it be a church or whatever that would be another family um [noise] 

259.11 260.27 B: mhm 

261.86 263.60 B: people that you rely on 

263.28 268.93 A: right right and i think it's just a a matter of of support i think um 

263.66 264.58 B: right 

269.07 277.93 A: whether you have the support system in place or you don't have a suppor- support system in place whether you feel that um 

277.92 284.69 A: you're not alone i think that's got a lot to do with it if you've got family of some kind then you don't feel alone 

284.20 285.32 B: right 

285.30 286.45 A: you know 

286.01 291.11 B: i remember ah when i went to college i went to a state where i didn't know anyone 

291.03 305.57 B: and um [lipsmack] i remember think- you know i had room mates and everything but still it wasn't the same and i remember thinking and i was far away on the other side of the country from where my home was where my family was and so i remember thinking you know if i were to get in a car accident 

291.06 291.90 A: mhm 

300.96 302.02 A: mhm 

305.37 310.43 B: you know and need to go to hospital would anyone there'd be no one here that would really 

310.47 313.10 B: be worried so much you know 

313.08 314.12 A: yeah 

313.17 314.68 B: and um 

315.13 318.06 B: [lipsmack] so you know family is 

318.21 328.23 B: you know it i did feel more alone when i was without my family when i didn't have those family ties and then eventually living out there i met my husband my 

322.56 323.35 A: (( ahah )) 

328.30 340.65 B: who was to be my husband and his family became my family and so i just felt so much more support you know local support and and my whole attitude just changed so 

339.99 349.65 A: oh there there there's a security level involved as well you know um i think that's very important um i also think that sometimes 

343.54 344.69 B: mhm 

349.77 351.01 A: [noise] families 

351.06 358.23 A: blood families um can also be like you said the negative part of your life where they 

358.16 366.16 A: they are the cause of stress um and then it depends on how we handle it you know 

359.95 361.21 B: (( right [noise] )) 

364.76 365.79 B: right 

366.29 373.46 B: well right now the mom to two young kids so i have a lot of i have a three year old and an eight month old so 

366.42 367.31 A: because i 

369.94 371.15 A: (( [noise] )) 

372.44 375.17 A: ooh oh my gosh 

374.40 387.03 B: so i you know like i said it cau- nothing causes me the most you know as much happiness as my kids and my my husband and but no- nothing causes me as much stress as trying to 

387.14 393.07 B: you know deal with my three year old's hundred thousand questions and deal with her whining you know what i mean 

390.68 392.16 A: oh i know 

392.98 399.24 A: oh sure because my my baby is going to be twenty five in about um a week and a half 

398.47 399.58 B: wow 

399.28 401.08 A: so um 

401.24 404.22 A: when i look back and i remember what 

404.19 411.71 A: what was very important ah family wise you know [noise] the amount of energy [noise] we i used then 

407.75 408.83 B: right 

411.67 424.95 A: certainly is very different than what i use now [noise] more then was the parenting that was needed um and the family participation in raising the children you know um 

415.11 416.21 B: right 

424.65 425.71 B: right 

424.90 429.60 A: wi- with my own parents helping me and and their father and all that but 

429.75 439.55 A: now my job is just that i can sit back kind of and just be mom which is kind of neat you know because yeah [laughter] 

434.48 435.60 B: right 

435.82 440.78 B: more supportive than less physically demanding [laughter] 

440.00 445.24 A: yeah oh it's still demanding because when they get bigger their problems seem to be 

445.47 452.58 A: um bigger um and you know like when they are little and they fall and you kiss their boo boos and it's okay 

446.46 448.34 B: right that's true 

452.11 453.55 B: right 

452.82 461.01 A: wh- when they get older their boo boos sometimes get bigger and it's like what the heck were you thinking [laughter] you know 

458.71 471.55 B: right right well i think now it wi- you know the mo- being the mom of or a parent of young children i'm i it's a more it's more of a physical challenge i stay home with my kids and so i'm with them all day long and 

467.41 468.68 A: mhm 

471.55 479.52 B: um it's just a constant you know bluh bluh like just physical and then i feel like my mom's is more where my mom is now 

479.41 480.50 A: mhm 

479.66 484.81 B: um it's probably kind of where you are where her children are older hers is more 

485.01 490.94 B: an emotional you know there's mor- more emotionally demanding than physically demanding 

486.99 489.19 A: [noise] oh yeah 

490.70 498.52 A: well yeah because we can't fix we as we parents to growing children we can't um 

498.55 512.78 A: we can't just reach out and put a band-aid on it or and and we're really limited as to how much information you know um yo- you what you try to do is yo- you give them an opinion without [laughter] giving them an opinion 

501.42 502.52 B: right 

512.18 515.58 B: right [laughter] without being too forceful right 

512.80 526.70 A: [laughter] you know you know [laughter] that makes it very difficult sometimes [laughter] you know but nonetheless you're still family so that gives you kind of the right to to have an opinion 

515.94 516.98 B: right 

517.57 519.25 B: [laughter] 

520.73 521.92 B: (( yeah )) 

526.27 527.91 B: right right 

527.30 531.02 A: you know um and and it you know um 

531.78 537.06 A: and this is just my opinion maintaining a family um 

537.34 551.13 A: as as fam- well a family unit say is i think one of the most difficult jobs that we have in our in both of our lives because it is so very important to be maintained 

550.54 551.71 B: mhm 

551.13 554.29 A: and i think it is a very difficult thing to 

554.54 557.72 A: keep in some kind of balance or some kind of check 

557.36 558.75 B: mhm 

558.13 559.90 A: you know [noise] um 

560.86 563.78 A: be- because there's so many variables 

562.99 564.04 B: right 

563.93 575.46 A: you know um if we could live on each of us live on an our own island and make our own rules and no one else would you know interfere with them you know we wouldn't have to worry 

573.09 574.17 B: mhm 

575.28 576.30 B: right 

575.44 583.01 A: about stuff but that's not the way it is so that i think is an added stress too to keep our family safe 

580.93 581.87 B: right 

583.25 585.70 B: yes you try to protect 

584.27 585.20 A: right 

585.86 586.42 B: (( [mn] )) 

585.88 586.75 A: (( mhm )) 

586.51 588.17 B: you know on all levels 

586.82 591.32 A: yeah oh definitely because this is a really um 

589.61 590.17 B: (( [mn] )) 

591.35 593.54 A: wacky world um 

592.56 593.83 B: right 

594.22 599.95 A: the things that you're facing now with your little ones i didn't have to face and the things that i faced
