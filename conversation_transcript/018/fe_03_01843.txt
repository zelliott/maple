48.97 52.26 B: basically my entirely life is centered around um 

52.59 61.38 B: you know internet and i do i'm using raising on the on the computer some papers to research 

61.52 65.70 B: to sometimes classes so um 

66.52 71.01 B: i think um computers facilitate um education um 

71.31 77.78 B: and you know the negative sense i guess um because of the extensive use of computers 

77.81 82.96 B: um there is not so much of of a hands on learning like 

83.06 91.51 B: i don't go to the library as much because i can get my books at i mean i can research on the computer you know what i mean 

90.43 92.23 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

92.18 93.03 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

93.05 94.40 B: (( what do you think )) 

94.02 97.70 A: well i think it's very good very good what you said [noise] um 

98.10 106.57 A: i think it's excellent i think it is an excellent tool i think that [noise] our kids are just so much smarter from it because ah they're so 

105.56 107.64 B: you think they get smarter 

107.23 116.51 A: oh yeah 'cause i think there is just so much at their fingertips to ah you know access ah [noise] to learn so many good programs [noise] and um 

110.59 111.47 B: okay 

116.74 119.09 A: i think it is very helpful but on the other hand 

119.38 131.08 A: some of on the computer can be very dangerous to our children and even to adults because there is just too much wrong stuff there too things that they shouldn't be able to you know [noise] see 

123.03 123.97 B: right 

127.95 129.09 B: right 

130.31 131.81 B: (( to access )) 

131.28 135.23 A: right and that's why i you know don't like some of it so 

134.84 138.72 B: so overall would you be against um 

138.77 142.96 B: computers in learning or would you be for it 

141.96 154.11 A: no i i i would be definitely for it but if it really came right down to kids i think it should be like chaperoned sort of thing [laughter] [noise] you know it should be blocked i think it should be blocked definitely blocked 

148.78 149.71 B: okay 

154.18 155.33 A: on the computer 

154.39 158.42 B: yeah but the the the thing about blocking is 

158.58 159.64 B: (( [noise] )) 

160.07 166.01 B: oh so you mean so parents should be responsible for what their kids 

164.11 172.13 A: right right right but i think it is an excellent tool and i think it has made our kids so much more aware and smarter [mn] and 

172.71 180.04 A: i don't know where today we'd be without them really [laughter] because we've all become so accustomed to them you know it's like wow where would i be you know 

175.12 176.58 B: you know i 

180.09 192.31 B: yeah i would have to ag- agree with you because i really don't like just personally i don't like the first thing i do when i get up is go on the computer and you know check my email check my assignments 

187.73 188.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

190.78 194.63 A: me too mhm mhm

196.48 197.62 A: mhm 

201.47 202.28 A: [noise] 

201.60 213.43 B: so in that sense it's really helped me a lot but in the other sense why don't i just get up and walk to class and you know give it to my teacher myself you know 

211.91 223.87 A: mhm mhm but i i think it would save time you know and and give us sort of like a like a freedom in that way you know and it is just so convenient so convenient 

213.74 214.97 B: so um you 

219.90 221.00 B: (( know right )) 

221.86 226.93 B: it's it's very it's it's very convenient it's extremely convenient 

227.04 230.41 B: i would have to agree with you on that 

230.67 234.57 A: right again and also it has a a like a 

230.78 232.38 B: yeah so um 

234.60 237.51 A: world out there of anything you'd want

244.70 245.84 B: mhm 

248.82 249.69 B: right 

253.77 254.81 B: right

262.54 263.24 A: ah 

264.85 269.54 A: yeah so that that i think is is i think it just makes everybody smarter 

269.63 278.46 B: yeah it it it [noise] i think it does or like and then like you were saying though [noise] there's a lot of things on the internet that [noise] um 

277.32 279.31 A: (( mhm make you yeah [noise] )) 

279.11 280.55 B: make you 

279.46 283.08 A: make make somebody too smart that don't need to know some of that stuff right 

282.67 284.91 B: exactly like you know 

283.62 285.76 A: mhm mhm 

285.16 292.47 B: five year not five but even even high school kids things that they are exposed to that really you know 

292.53 293.65 A: right just 

292.62 295.76 B: they don't need to be exposed to okay 

294.13 302.06 A: right like like for me i do have a block on my my internet [noise] i have a christian internet and it is called seven eleven online 

298.93 299.83 B: okay 

302.35 303.41 B: okay 

302.38 305.38 A: and we don't have to deal with the pop up things 

305.19 306.22 B: mhm 

305.61 316.31 A: which i hate them things because i've been on you know the regular internet and sometimes they pop up and they are very bad and so our kids would be sitting there you know and something pop up i mean they are not even doing anything wrong 

316.21 322.11 A: and yet they are going to see it you know and i think there could be a danger in the chat room thing too 

318.08 319.02 B: right 

319.11 320.11 B: exactly 

322.18 326.79 A: ah which wouldn't be too cool [noise] for them to be you know there with that 

325.17 326.18 B: right 

326.34 328.19 B: right exactly 

326.96 331.98 A: so like i say i i just think it should be filtered [laughter] there is no other way 

331.00 331.95 B: yeah 

332.36 334.88 A: you know there's just no other way i mean i 

332.66 333.72 B: yeah 

335.18 345.59 B: yeah and anoth- another thing that i think is um that it should be although it is more widespread in the u._s. i think that 

345.46 358.32 B: you know there are certain populations and certain people who don't have any access to you know computer access and this is very detrimental to their development you know as um 

351.00 352.64 A: (( i [noise] right right )) 

358.62 364.27 B: you know citizens because you know as the world gets more you know 

364.69 375.03 B: you know more what do you call it technolo- you know technology based um people who don't have any um 

369.16 369.74 A: (( [noise] )) 

370.34 372.31 A: mhm mhm 

374.28 375.89 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

375.63 387.88 B: any you know command over the internet would be at a very you know large disadvantage to people who have you know grown up in a school system where you know internet 

381.89 383.16 A: right 

385.13 386.13 A: (( [noise] right )) 

387.85 392.18 B: or not only internet but just computer use is it's very wide spread 

391.06 391.85 A: [noise] 

392.37 393.56 A: (( that's right )) 

392.88 393.96 B: so um 

394.17 395.58 A: [noise] but i find it's 

394.48 395.63 B: i think 

396.00 397.39 A: (( go ahead i'm sorry )) 

396.82 398.54 B: no sorry continue 

398.45 400.93 A: (( go right ahead no go ahead go ahead finish )) 

400.92 411.32 B: oh okay yeah so i think you know that you know we have a long way to go in terms of kind of equalizing the distribution of you know computer 

410.08 411.02 A: right 

411.03 412.16 A: (( right [noise] )) 

411.38 412.48 B: access 

412.61 418.19 B: because there's just i just think it's very unfortunate that some people you know don't 

418.89 427.28 B: don't know how to use a computer 'cause when they go to get jobs or when they go to you know apply for college or whatever 

420.39 421.34 A: right 

424.46 429.02 A: oh forget it mhm mhm mhm 

428.25 442.37 B: yeah it's going they're not going to have that upper hand and and it's you know even if they are very bright and even if they are you know smart you know a lot of times like you know in applying for different 

429.05 430.09 A: mhm 

431.22 432.27 A: (( that's right )) 

436.26 438.86 A: right right [noise] mhm 

442.34 446.12 B: programs or whatever they will ask you like what's your you know 

445.73 447.26 A: mhm 

446.55 452.82 B: you know how good are you using like certain computer programs or you know and 

450.64 451.78 A: (( right )) 

451.81 455.29 A: you can't even go be a waiter without knowing how to do the computer 

455.47 458.10 B: (( ba- exactly basically )) 

456.38 461.57 A: i mean ev- even even a cashier any more without knowing how to do the computer because everything is computer 

461.42 467.39 B: exactly so it's [noise] it's a very big part of our ah society and um 

466.84 479.25 A: right but then i find out the the older generation they are afraid of it they don't really know anything about it [noise] they stay away from it and ah they are just not even interested in it they just think oh all this technology and they don't even you know 

473.36 474.62 B: (( mhm )) 

476.71 477.89 B: right 

479.30 480.82 A: [noise] so i think 

479.48 485.96 B: right because i mean 'cause they went through it to their entire schooling their entire education with no 

483.65 485.93 A: mhm mhm 

486.09 493.72 B: no kind of you know computer at all everything had to be handwritten if not typed typewritten and either 

488.53 489.73 A: that's right 

490.93 497.13 A: mhm [mn] and they don't know how to use it and they don't even want to learn [laughter] nope 

495.53 498.61 B: they don't because they are kind of you know 

498.63 501.58 B: trying very against this whole 

500.63 502.52 A: right mhm mhm 

501.78 508.87 B: you know computerized world which in a way i can see you know where they are going because if everything is on the computer then 

506.28 507.58 A: right 

508.99 512.18 B: you know what else is left out there you know like 

510.60 521.25 A: mhm mhm but again like you said if you don't learn it or if you don't know it as as a young person you don't stand a chance in this world any more [laughter] at least people around here 

513.05 513.95 B: (( but )) 

515.64 518.56 B: exac- that's that's the second exactly 

519.34 521.01 B: you don't so 

521.35 523.87 B: so you really don't have a choice 

523.67 524.65 A: that's right 

523.99 527.20 B: really but i mean you know i mean 

527.21 535.40 B: some people don't have a choice [noise] and they can't use it 'cause they don't have it but i mean you know if you want to be anything and do anything 

534.63 542.21 A: well i think they even teach little kindergarteners ah the computer i think they start off that young in schools teaching them ah how to use it 

542.54 545.03 B: oh really i don't know much about um 

545.34 547.10 B: [noise] about um 

547.09 561.28 B: lower lower classes and their use of compute- actually yes i do because like now like i know that even before kids start going to school parents get you know you know these computer programs that teach them 

558.20 560.96 A: oh yeah mhm 

561.15 563.89 B: (( you know how to how to read )) 

562.35 564.67 A: them abc's and all that stuff 

563.90 567.06 B: exactly colors and all those things so 

565.82 569.46 A: oh yeah yeah it's a great tool it's a great tool 

568.86 572.88 B: so from very early on they're already you know 

572.35 574.20 A: mhm smart 

573.62 576.21 B: and pl- exactly they're already [noise] 

574.80 576.86 A: and it's so amazing some of these kids 

576.93 583.39 A: i was in a furniture store once and there was this little boy i'd say he must have been about i don't know six or seven i'd say 

583.35 584.32 B: (( mhm )) 

583.48 589.70 A: he's doing this video game on this computer because they had it for kids to you know waste time and be good or whatever 

589.78 590.91 B: right 

590.10 599.88 A: and he was doing [laughter] so good and i just stopped and i looked at the little boy and i thought man you're good he goes oh yeah i can kill this and i can do that or whatever they were doing and
