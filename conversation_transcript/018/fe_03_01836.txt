11.12 12.20 B: hi roy 

13.23 20.00 B: um okay the ah oh topic ah that i just found out about is computers in education

32.08 33.79 B: okay now ah 

34.16 38.03 B: [cough] um i really think that's a good idea because ah 

38.85 42.57 B: i know ah when my daughter was in ah grade school 

42.67 48.35 B: um they insisted and i think it was in fourth grade that she learn computers 

48.86 56.48 B: and ah i really ah it helped her considerably when she went to college and had to work on computers 

56.62 58.39 B: for some of her classes 

58.68 66.84 B: um i ah think it's good that the kids are learning today in school i think they should have for every kid in school that they have a computer 

66.94 70.38 B: ah programs because it helps with their 

70.97 75.09 B: well their school work and you can really learn a lot ah 

75.64 79.88 B: you know from ah the computers you get a lot of information out of them 

80.45 81.25 A: (( yes )) 

80.54 81.28 B: i 

81.27 84.74 A: i've grown up with computers all my life i'm in college right now 

84.45 85.57 B: (( oh okay )) 

85.30 88.40 A: and computers really simplify life 

87.80 90.69 B: right i don't have a computer ah but ah 

91.34 97.86 B: my daughter does my brother does he's going to ah university he's going to temple he's going to be an engineer 

97.89 102.99 B: and ah he had to buy a new computer and he has to learn on the computer 

103.14 105.59 B: because he never used computers before 

105.70 110.32 B: and my daughter and her fiance had to teach him and some other students at temple 

110.77 111.85 A: oh okay 

110.92 112.83 B: but ah he's ah 

112.92 120.21 B: he's doing good with that it's just taking him a while to ah get into computer programs and then ah write programs for 

120.97 133.91 A: yeah i think in school like in grade school they should teach children like basic computer skills like word processing and how to make use microsoft office and windows and stuff like that 

121.02 121.89 B: (( it oh )) 

122.14 123.00 B: but 

127.63 128.65 B: right 

133.25 140.59 B: i know cause as i say my daughter ah when she was ah my daughter daughter's twenty six now when he was going to henry school elementary 

140.59 148.87 B: at the time ah they ah i think they were just starting to use computers and ah that's when she first ah started using em in school and grade school 

149.05 151.00 B: and i know it helped her a lot 

151.41 153.51 B: because my brother ah 

153.67 160.12 B: started to go back to ah college become an engineer he had no concept and ah she helped him 

160.38 166.08 B: and ah work out programs and stuff and because of her knowledge ah it helped my brother 

166.73 169.27 B: and i really i think it is because ah 

169.58 178.74 B: i think what have i seen on t._v. they have places now for young kids to go and learn computers and ah the benefits they can get from it 

178.77 186.18 B: ah with their school work if they wanna look up a project or something ah you know on the ah computer 

186.31 195.06 B: ah about a subject they like i think it's great you can look up ah all kinds off things on the computer today health issues ah 

195.42 199.71 B: any issues you know that come up that ah child is interested in 

200.16 211.34 A: [mn] that's true with the internet they have online encyclopedia dictionaries you can search for anything you want and that's what makes the learning process so [mn] nice 

204.58 205.64 B: mhm 

211.04 212.77 B: it is it's really great 

212.38 213.95 A: it makes it a lot easier 

214.07 221.39 A: you can even go to a li- like the local university library online see if they have a book in in stock on the shelf 

220.36 221.33 B: okay 

221.88 225.26 A: you can see if it's checked out i think it's great so [mn] 

224.34 226.90 B: yeah i didn't know that that's even better 

227.02 231.49 A: well i know they do that at my university i don't know about the local libraries [mn] 

230.87 232.79 B: oh what university do you go to 

232.88 235.06 A: the university of oklahoma 

234.48 236.52 B: oh okay that's great okay 

237.80 243.31 A: and i think computers are great i've been like i've been using them more and more and more now 

243.04 243.87 B: (( ahah )) 

243.53 248.75 A: and each of my classes whenever i turn something in it has to be typed up on the computer 

248.37 249.35 B: okay 

248.95 253.71 A: because like when normal students just write stuff out [mn] they 

253.92 258.75 A: make it really sloppy or some some of them don't have good handwriting 

258.15 260.55 B: i know i know my brother ah 

260.70 273.49 B: oh ah [mn] i think he likes computer better because my brother doesn't rel- he can write but basically used to print [laughter] and ah you can get ah i think it's good because you can get the information off the computer 

273.65 275.77 B: (( and what i've seen ah )) 

276.01 279.11 B: on t._v. you can send ah oh 

279.36 285.09 B: ah oh my boyfriend ah his nephew sometimes call for the computer 

285.54 287.21 A: yes i've done that before [noise] 

286.54 287.44 B: and i've 

287.96 294.67 B: well that's that's ah interesting i've never heard of that before that's an interesting concept and then you can send um 

294.94 296.87 B: what is it pictures 

296.97 299.24 A: pictures and videos you can do 

298.29 304.71 B: yeah i think that's i mean i i haven't looked at this stu- i mean i computer but the more i notice 

304.74 311.45 B: read about and watch it on t._v. and what they can do it's just so amazing and they've really it's i think it's a good thing 

311.68 313.85 B: absolutely and i think ah 

314.04 317.51 B: i think they should have it in every school in our city 

317.68 325.87 B: i mean it i i think it's good for all the kids especially the kids and and oh in neighborhoods where they don't have ah 

326.45 330.59 B: ah you know a good library they can use and i think the li- 

331.11 334.24 B: (( i live in philadelphia there's a little library downtown and )) 

334.22 345.46 B: where i go to the library market and the kids can use the computers but they have to take turns you had to you know sign up but i i definitely with all schools and schools especially in maybe 

345.33 349.23 B: neighborhoods that aren't too good because maybe the kids ah 

349.64 354.81 B: oh they can enjoy the computer they can ah get all kinds of information 

354.89 355.84 B: (( ah )) 

356.19 367.55 B: you know it become a thing and i think really all schools in our city and all the cities should have ah starting i guess third fourth grade maybe even younger to have computers if the 

367.41 371.52 B: school system can provide for i think it's a great thing to have 

371.69 375.97 A: i've been to a few schools where in kindergarten they have computers [noise] they 

375.03 376.88 B: wow that's even better 

376.84 387.92 A: have little programs like the color program and the numbers program and like the typing tutor and i was really surprised at how smart these kids were 

379.49 380.50 B: okay 

383.05 384.02 B: (( mhm )) 

387.08 388.59 B: what school was that 

388.80 394.11 A: this was a ah this was a local private school i saw one like that 

393.52 395.29 B: ah that seems great 

395.21 399.80 A: in a local public school they had i think in first grade 

398.72 399.57 B: (( ah )) 

399.91 407.88 A: they had it or they would use the alphabet you know do like literature and english and everything and simple math programs 

404.55 405.67 B: right 

407.26 412.85 B: well i think the younger the better today because i i realized i don't have a computer never learned one 

412.92 416.91 B: but i realize today that more and more um 

418.38 423.54 B: um all kinds of things are done on computers where years ago it used to be handwritten 

423.61 427.16 B: (( and ah they're computers are like ah )) 

427.30 431.22 B: the thing of the future i mean it's like now and ah the younger 

431.23 437.00 B: the child today learning computers it's good because this is what a person is gonna need to 

437.20 448.96 B: um and whatever kind of job you use you're still gonna have to have a computer to put in the information whether you're an engineer a teacher whatever it is i mean this is the way the future is today 

449.10 451.99 B: [mn] you know this is the the coming thing 

449.14 450.13 A: (( it is )) 

452.12 456.58 A: yes and if you're teaching a child early on it's a lot easier for them to learn 

456.35 458.07 B: oh i agree i agree 

459.22 472.23 B: i think that's ah you know a good idea i mean my daughter had the advantage when she went to grade school it was a good school and they had computers and ah you said now they start in kindergarten that's even better 

473.27 478.69 A: i mean i was really surprised my school didn't have computers till around third or fourth grade 

478.09 478.91 B: (( ahah )) 

478.74 490.88 A: and then we only had like we had one or two in maybe every classroom now when i go back to the that school my elementary school every classroom it's five and then they have computer labs all around the school 

483.07 483.97 B: okay 

490.63 492.06 B: oh wow 

491.99 497.16 A: so i mean now they have more money to invest in computer now that they see 

494.65 495.81 B: (( right for it before they just took a )) 

496.05 497.27 B: (( chance on it to see what was going )) 

498.12 500.94 A: (( the potential mhm )) 

500.16 501.20 B: (( to happen right )) 

501.49 505.31 A: and every any job you get you're gonna to use a computer somehow 

505.01 506.97 B: oh i know i know it's true 

507.67 514.03 B: because ah i know my brother ah he was telling me that engineer but um 

514.46 518.52 B: a lot of the work he's doing in college right now um 

518.61 523.48 B: has to come off the computer because he's doing something called like capstone 

523.82 527.57 B: and it's something i think he's trying to tell me like if you ah 

527.62 532.41 B: oh we're building a pro- ah a building you had to put down estimates and 

532.35 545.68 B: ah what equipment would cost and ah the what you would have to buy and ah you know measures and this and everything now he said ah almost all subjects have to be 

546.13 550.52 B: ah put in a computer and printed out and then he had has to do ah 

550.92 558.92 B: computer programs and ah couple of students at temple has helped him when he couldn't do it himself when my daughter wasn't around but ah 

558.95 561.67 B: he's realized his computer ah 

561.90 563.90 B: he never had it in 

564.12 568.73 B: ah oh and he went to c- he went to central high school in philadelphia i don't think ah 

568.91 572.76 B: i don't think they had them then they might've but he didn't take it up 

573.04 577.03 B: but now i know my daughter was in school ah she had 

577.38 581.09 B: i think she went to computer class a couple days a week 

581.15 583.32 B: and that was i think in fourth grade 

583.50 589.51 A: yeah i had a computer class too where we did basic word processing then later in high school 

587.12 588.07 B: mhm 

589.88 592.74 A: the classes were more developed where i had to 

592.81 597.86 A: create presentations and things like this make graphs and everything 

597.20 598.28 B: (( mhm )) 

597.95 599.89 A: really that helped me out later on in col-
