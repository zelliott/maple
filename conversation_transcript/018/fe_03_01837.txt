12.96 14.62 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

17.41 22.84 A: well computers and education definitely definitely help education [noise] 

23.26 26.20 A: there is so much you can learn on the internet 

26.36 35.12 A: they're they're they're useful in typing research everything i can't imagine sending my kids to a school that 

35.18 37.20 A: did not use computers 

36.68 47.38 B: nor could i um i i couldn't agree with you any more um i think they've done nothing but broaden the you know perception of what is out there and it's brought a lot of things that 

47.26 54.07 B: that we never would have learned about that we read about in books but it was just that it was maybe a picture in a book and now 

53.96 63.70 B: i don't know there it just seems like it's it's has broadened the avenue of information i probably sound like a cliche there but um i'm not a teacher or anything but 

61.55 62.63 A: it's true [noise] 

63.65 64.57 B: um 

64.43 75.45 B: i at times i i was in in school for teaching and i could not imagine i actually taught a class last night but but i could not imagine not having computers at a ah 

72.71 73.96 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

75.24 88.19 B: at my disposal or at or at my disposal as a college student i didn't necessarily have em growing up until high school but um i couldn't imagine being [noise] in grade school now and not having a computer 

88.45 97.67 A: [noise] [noise] it's funny my daughter is in preschool and they use computers [noise] all the time i can't i just it's just there is so much they can do there's [noise] so much 

92.38 93.30 B: right 

97.81 98.94 A: they can 

99.03 107.74 A: [noise] access [noise] and it brings it brings [noise] the information to life it's [noise] right [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] 

100.37 101.12 B: (( right )) 

104.04 105.38 B: (( right i just can't imagine life without )) 

106.82 111.64 B: computers no neither could i and i i don't know that i would have initially said that because i was you know 

111.45 115.01 B: computer ignorant for the first few years when they started 

111.50 113.13 A: [noise] 

114.82 128.93 B: really um being more broadly used um i was kind of afraid of them you know um my nieces and my nephews kinda knew more about em than i did initially and now i too i i have a three year old and she is um 

124.70 125.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

128.74 142.14 B: she's awesome at the computer and she's learned so much through you know colors and shapes and linguistics and you know just just pretty everything that she does on there she's learning 

134.98 135.99 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

142.10 147.67 B: and ah you know [mn] and often motor skills and all that you know so it's very important i think 

144.99 146.50 A: (( oh yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

147.56 158.51 B: especially with with with younger kids now to get em before they are jaded um because i know when i started that i was i was very you know very nervous about what to do and i 

158.99 168.21 B: remember taking keyboarding in high school and being like i this is just this is so bizarre i don't but i guess that was before the internet i'm thirty three so 

168.52 177.08 B: i graduated in nineteen eighty eight and i guess like um early eighties eighty four we started we had like two computers in our school and now 

177.43 180.09 B: ah i actually recently went back to a 

180.90 189.91 B: um [lipsmack] actually a couple of years ago i well to my reunion and [mn] every classroom had you know fifteen twenty forty of em in each classroom that's pretty cool 

189.52 190.70 A: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] i )) 

191.32 197.43 A: computers i i've been on computers as since as long as i can remember [noise] [noise] it's just 

195.74 196.70 B: wow 

197.72 201.62 A: i i i just can't imagine life without them [noise] i know that sounds so 

202.15 203.72 A: so odd but 

203.65 207.22 B: no it really doesn't sound odd [laughter] you know 

206.39 209.63 A: well i'm like i'm i'm only twenty three so 

209.07 210.75 B: okay okay 

209.82 218.13 A: it's just been [noise] it's been such a part of my life since as long as i can remember i can't i can't remember like 

214.92 216.58 B: right right [noise] 

218.53 224.48 A: [noise] i think is it from like middle school on computers [noise] have always 

224.76 227.96 A: been in the classroom we've always used them [noise] 

227.34 241.93 B: right and i'm assuming that you probably at that point you know after a few years you knew a lot more about them than your parents probably unless they were you know obviously in the in the computer field but people um i guess you're parent's age especially like they were 

233.77 234.76 A: oh yeah 

241.43 242.78 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] oh yeah )) 

241.77 255.43 B: initially it was like this this weird thing there was a movie a long time ago called two thousand and one a space odyssey and yeah it's an excellent movie and that was like the first exposure i ever had to a computer or what a computer did and 

247.60 249.18 A: [noise] [noise] good movie 

249.60 250.55 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise] )) 

255.74 261.04 B: especially it's so funny how they used to be like these humongous large things 

260.35 261.96 A: (( [noise] now they're so little )) 

261.30 264.00 B: now [laughter] they're so little you're right you know 

263.18 264.48 A: it's amazing 

264.14 267.33 B: you have em on a cell phone it's like it's amazing 

267.08 281.49 A: i ah i was taking this class last semester [noise] and my teacher or my professor was telling us [noise] about these little microscopic like pa- computers like the size of a a grain of sand 

280.87 282.10 B: wow 

281.48 283.99 A: they were developing i it's just 

283.96 286.37 B: that is so unfathomable you know 

285.45 290.35 A: it just amazes me they used to take up entire rooms now they're the grain of a 

288.21 289.31 B: right 

289.80 296.99 B: now they're a tiny grain that's that's amazing it really is amazing [noise] um you said your you have a daughter in preschool 

296.48 297.83 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

297.05 304.25 B: um [mn] do they computers i'm assuming at preschool and [mn] like you said they they all use them and access them 

302.40 304.00 A: (( [noise] yep [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

304.36 308.31 B: it really helps motor skills i think too i mean 

308.42 321.44 B: my daughter initially when she started messing around with this she was like one and a half i guess or something like that just because we did she would like hit the keyboard and now she like knows how to double click and how to right click 

316.92 317.78 A: mhm 

321.36 333.13 B: it's it's so cool it's so cool to watch kids on computers because they're learning the entire time you know and they don't even know they're learning which is even more of the beauty of it so i i think they're 

327.70 329.05 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] oh yeah )) 

333.24 336.42 B: an absolute necessity i could not see you 

336.74 351.35 B: know you know a lot of like ah people who live more rurally i mean i'm not saying that they can't learn but the um the scope of what they can learn is just so minimalized compared to what you know mainstream schools it's just 

336.89 338.35 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

351.41 353.01 A: (( [noise] [noise] definitely )) 

352.48 360.38 B: yep definitely so i think all the money and all the funding that goes towards internet uses absolutely money well spent [noise] 

356.42 357.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

359.88 369.01 A: definitely i mean i'm [noise] all for computers and education as far as the internet [noise] i'm al [noise] all for it as long as they [noise] provide certain safeguards 

368.39 372.01 B: absolutely yeah that's mandatory you know 

369.63 370.60 A: (( that's it's )) 

371.52 372.62 A: essential 

372.31 378.62 B: [mn] ah it is essential because we don't want em you know learning how to use em for the wrong reasons although they figure that out you know 

378.51 388.76 B: [laughter] as they go i'm sure how to do that but um yeah there definitely needs to be you know lots of network security in schools in school systems um 'cause 

378.90 380.07 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

388.61 400.85 A: [mn] i was just ah back at my high school they now make students sign an internet usage policy [noise] before they're allowed access to any of the computer labs 

396.29 397.28 B: really 

400.15 405.05 B: saying that if you don't use it probably you risk what like um 

404.27 406.53 A: [noise] [mn] it's no access 

405.95 409.72 B: oh you get no access it's like like a once and done type thing 

407.26 408.22 A: no 

409.16 412.94 A: n- um i think it's two strikes you're out 

412.48 413.56 B: wow 

413.38 416.27 A: which i'm i'm i think that's 

417.04 421.20 A: that's essential for high school for 

421.78 422.88 A: (( all of them [laughter] [noise] )) 

422.62 423.71 B: right 

423.10 424.86 A: (( sleepy girl sleepy girl )) 

424.76 427.07 B: right you you're daughter is going to sleep right now 

426.41 428.28 A: yes she's laying on 

428.46 429.76 A: (( me [laughter] )) 

428.90 434.84 B: i just actually just put my three year old to bed she's in there ah listening to music and playing of course but 

434.21 436.05 A: [laughter] 

435.20 437.22 B: it's ah [noise] pretty cool 

436.46 440.46 A: but computers definitely have to have them [noise] [noise] 

438.74 441.00 B: (( absolutely absolute )) 

441.25 446.15 B: absolute [mn] are you have you done this for is this like your first call or 

445.52 447.60 A: this is my first call 

446.67 451.69 B: this is my first call too [laughter] at first i didn't answer the phone and i was like 

451.51 462.89 B: u. of penn what the heck i actually i'm a i'm a children and family therapist and i um i make some referrals to university of pennsylvania to like their anxiety clinic and whatnot 

462.41 463.48 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] oh wow )) 

463.02 464.40 B: and ah 

464.52 477.36 B: when i first saw them like jesus is this going to be a call about a client [laughter] and if it is it is probably an emergency but ah then i got i immediately called back so i guess you do three calls a day 

467.98 469.54 A: (( [noise] [laughter] [laughter] [noise] )) 

477.33 478.76 A: (( ah i )) 

478.77 481.83 A: this is like the first time they've ever called me so i 

480.96 491.84 B: right okay it's it's it's pretty [mn] as we're thinking about that you know they're using computers as an educational tool to learn about us because the computers are making these phone calls 

484.61 485.80 A: (( [noise] )) 

488.66 489.84 A: mhm 

491.36 492.32 A: that's 

492.17 499.53 B: and picking the topics that's pretty interesting it's kind of ironic yeah like you said it's just so hard to to even 

494.59 495.89 A: oh yeah 

499.46 511.78 B: fathom a school or any kind of education system be it like you know even like a low cost um no cost to you like head start program because they even have 'em like

536.55 538.16 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] ))
