0.00 1.50 B: (( [noise] hello )) 

1.12 2.78 A: hi 

2.79 3.87 B: how's it going 

3.89 5.84 A: good good thanks 

6.29 7.49 B: my name is shan 

8.06 10.84 A: my name is heun korean name 

11.75 12.78 B: okay 

14.12 16.71 A: so we are supposed to talk about education 

14.19 15.48 B: (( ah )) 

16.75 17.74 B: yes 

17.69 22.79 A: but what aspect of education are we supposed to talk about i missed it i just missed it 

22.68 24.75 B: um she said 

25.52 26.57 B: ah 

26.79 31.01 B: how computers affect education in the classroom does it make for a 

31.28 34.61 B: um more advanced learning process or 

35.26 39.74 B: um is it kind of slightly a handicap or something like that 

39.70 41.24 A: okay i see 

41.14 42.16 B: yeah 

41.56 42.40 A: okay 

43.20 44.16 B: um 

44.20 46.37 B: basically my thoughts on the matter are 

46.64 50.47 B: if computers are overused in the classroom especially from a young age 

51.09 57.14 B: then they have the possibility of hurting the child's um cognitive skills as far as 

57.19 63.62 B: you know being able to spell words correctly rather than you know like a spell check which all will check the words kid's words 

63.90 75.16 B: or just act- like literacy in general because of the fact that you know a lot of computer programs aimed at children aren't really geared towards 

75.24 76.15 B: um 

76.44 78.10 B: critical thinking or 

78.18 84.96 B: or um extensive reading it's just point and click or small problem solving skills you know 

86.07 88.35 A: right right but um 

88.78 95.78 A: but um i mean for example the internet has provided a lot of you know new information 

96.12 99.25 B: oh definitely i i don't disagree with that at all 

97.44 99.08 A: so it's got a lot of 

99.28 101.68 A: a lot a lot of benefits as well 

102.01 103.61 B: yeah there are 

102.41 109.58 A: you you have a good point you have a good point but um depending on what kind of subs- what kind of subjects you are teaching 

109.41 111.15 B: mhm 

110.65 118.90 A: for example like in teaching foreign languages you know um it's it is hard to interact with the native speaker 

118.98 125.77 A: but by having the internet access or you know some c._d. rom programs 

119.24 120.20 B: mhm 

125.60 126.50 B: mhm 

126.49 129.07 A: students might be able to 

129.17 132.01 A: you know be exposed to the target language 

132.40 137.04 A: more easily without paying much without travelling to the target country 

132.90 133.91 B: (( definitely )) 

137.12 151.67 B: yeah well um i guess what my point is there has to be that balance between um the teacher and the computer um using the computer more as the tool and a supplement for the education rather than trying to replace the teacher 

152.24 154.91 A: oh yeah that's true 

153.38 154.60 B: you know that 

155.07 156.19 B: yeah 

155.24 161.64 A: right there should be some human you know subjectivity human touch you know 

159.86 161.16 B: (( definitely )) 

161.45 162.84 B: definitely 

162.21 163.79 A: (( right )) 

163.71 170.33 B: if you lose the human element of learning then you you definitely detract from the overall benefit of the education 

171.30 176.72 A: (( right i cannot really hear you are you watching something on t._v. or )) 

171.95 173.73 B: (( you can sort of become )) 

176.21 178.32 B: oh no no i'm i'm just ah 

178.61 180.03 B: my house has 

180.47 182.07 B: um a loud echo 

182.16 183.68 A: oh okay 

183.41 185.00 B: yeah hardwood floors 

185.26 186.79 A: oh i see okay 

186.65 187.50 B: yes 

188.80 190.38 B: is that better um 

189.54 192.25 A: yes now it's better much better 

192.19 193.04 B: okay 

193.06 194.25 A: okay 

194.94 198.30 B: but um yeah i definitely think that 

198.82 206.72 B: computers are a great thing as far as um the amount of information that is available through the computer um 

205.59 207.12 A: mhm 

206.85 211.57 B: the ease of use of a computer i mean they're so much more interac- ah 

211.62 216.79 B: interactive and user friendly now than they were when say i was a kid 

216.82 222.86 B: you know back in the days of the the tandys and the radio shacks and the commodores and things like that so 

222.96 224.41 B: it definitely 

224.72 226.83 B: helped me in a small way back then 

226.99 233.03 B: and i can see definitely that without computers right now my education would be 

233.10 235.79 B: fairly limited as far as the resources that i'd have 

236.04 236.84 B: (( you know )) 

237.55 240.25 A: (( are you a stu- student now or )) 

239.89 241.76 B: (( yes yes i am )) 

241.91 244.47 A: okay where are you studying what are you studying 

244.50 253.38 B: um i'm studying my generals right now i'm getting ready to finish them in another semester and then i'm going to study film making mhm 

253.71 255.24 A: oh i see 

256.03 265.55 A: i i heard that people in communication or film making they also use computer a lot like computer software programs a lot right 

265.58 266.69 B: definitely 

266.64 267.65 A: yeah 

266.74 267.85 B: especially 

268.25 272.83 B: especially um since a lot of movies are made digitally now 

272.97 274.63 A: (( right )) 

275.23 279.18 A: i'm doing graduate studies in education now 

279.99 281.99 A: (( especially in language )) 

282.28 284.12 A: applied linguistics 

284.40 288.60 A: so teaching for the languages in a classroom setting 

284.87 285.64 B: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

288.70 294.45 A: you know has been affected influenced a lot by computer technology as well 

294.45 296.11 B: mhm 

295.45 304.55 A: you know it plays very important role in in our computer technology like distribution of you know c._d. roms to each classroom 

305.87 307.45 B: so um 

307.59 310.53 B: when english is your second language correct 

310.22 311.48 A: yeah it is 

311.48 320.00 B: okay um and when you learned english did you use ah computers a lot in your education of english or were you 

320.04 322.79 B: exposed to it more through um 

322.94 326.96 B: social interaction um to the classroom or 

326.97 332.04 B: say through cassette tapes or did you travel abroad to learn it 

331.90 334.17 A: well you know um 

334.23 338.54 A: reading news articles or you know or for ed- 

339.92 344.44 A: obtaining information about english speaking culture and countries 

344.49 345.19 B: (( mhm )) 

344.65 351.54 A: on the internet that might be the easiest and cheapest way of you know learning or practising the language 

352.11 353.04 B: (( yes mhm )) 

352.54 358.45 A: compared to travelling abroad or having a native speaking teacher around 

358.38 359.96 B: mhm 

359.93 362.34 A: so but when i was learning english 

362.68 369.41 A: um i did some chattings on the internet or you know reading news articles 

369.57 378.74 A: on the internet but other than that not as actively as many you know young children are doing nowadays 

379.12 381.84 A: it wasn't like a mostly 

382.16 390.96 A: not the older mores but nowadays many programs have you know interactive older you know practise 

391.11 392.14 B: mhm 

391.51 394.04 A: with the computer programs 

394.57 398.32 A: thanks to you know high technology nowadays 

398.89 400.38 B: yeah 

401.24 403.94 A: but um i mean computer you know 

404.15 405.41 A: has 

405.51 408.35 A: a lot of benefits you know without 

408.79 411.15 A: charging too much you know 

409.12 409.96 B: oh i 

411.02 412.49 B: yes absolutely 

411.55 414.24 A: in terms of time and finance 

414.39 415.40 B: i love 

415.71 422.59 B: um getting on the internet to do research because of the ease of being able to find it rather than 

422.77 424.17 B: um spending 

424.38 429.29 B: days and weeks inside of a library doing that 

428.55 433.95 A: yeah i heard about that kind of a story a lot of college students 

434.04 445.31 A: rather than go to the library and do their own research they just go on to the internet web search engine and type up their you know their paper topic 

434.17 434.95 B: mhm 

445.24 451.11 A: and then just you know gather some information or just copy part of the 

445.46 446.29 B: mhm 

451.17 457.51 A: papers available on the internet which is not ethical at all in my opinion 

457.81 459.38 B: yeah 

458.71 460.16 A: that aspect 

461.63 462.54 A: hello 

462.60 463.40 B: (( hello )) 

462.99 468.64 A: oh yeah so in that aspect it's not necessarily positive you 

469.04 474.66 B: true very true um it definitely makes a person a little bit lazier 

469.82 470.54 A: (( know )) 

474.93 476.07 B: um 

476.33 483.59 B: but at the same time it provides more than what would be available in the hard copy in your library 

484.69 489.42 B: because you you get to draw off of um information from around the world 

489.58 493.24 B: rather than just what's available in your local library 

493.70 498.89 A: right but the issue is you know many students just copy a 

498.70 500.29 B: oh yes yes mhm 

499.27 500.97 A: piece of you know 

501.16 503.85 A: papers available on the internet rather than 

504.22 515.85 A: um they write their papers based on their own deflections or their own thinking after their you know reading extensive reading in the library 

506.88 507.81 B: mhm 

515.92 516.83 B: yeah 

516.65 519.98 A: even college students i mean university should be the 

520.27 529.54 A: place where people you know have to learn you know do how to do research or how to 

528.24 529.12 B: exactly 

530.01 533.42 B: well that that would definitely fall into one of the pitfalls of 

533.65 538.53 B: ease of computer use and the widespread availability of it but 

538.76 542.66 B: you know that that's definitely a self judgment call as far as 

542.92 546.83 B: um policing and all that i mean um 

548.01 550.02 B: you can't 

550.20 554.14 B: (( really ah what's the what am in trying to say here )) 

554.60 555.50 B: (( ah )) 

556.91 559.18 B: you can definitely hold a person accountable 

559.33 564.59 B: for that but ultimately it is up to that person themselves whether they're 

564.64 572.56 B: are going to um put in the effort to do it for themselves their research and um the reading and the extensive 

572.96 576.00 B: ah absorption of the material to 

576.17 578.43 B: formulate their own thoughts on the topic 

578.73 579.42 B: (( you know )) 

579.78 583.69 B: ah that's one thing that a lot of universities 

583.98 586.00 B: don't really teach is 

586.33 587.26 B: you know 

587.69 588.97 B: how to 

589.40 591.91 B: effectively research a topic 

592.42 594.53 B: um that i think it's 

594.59 597.73 B: definitely left up to the students in a lot of ways 

598.37 599.95 B: (( for a lot of years definitely ))
