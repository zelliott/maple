4.25 8.74 B: so we're talking about um education in in computers 

8.00 8.95 A: mhm 

9.22 12.88 B: okay i i actually i work for a school um high school 

12.26 13.24 A: oh really 

13.03 21.88 B: yeah and where i work at they do ah we do computers actually i go from classroom to classroom and when one of the classroom i go to is a ah a computer education class 

21.38 22.11 A: (( [noise] ahah )) 

22.40 35.21 B: um i do find that ah there is always pros and cons for everything um computers have taken over you know not just take- i don't mean taken over i mean computers are the future actually they're the present and the future 

27.28 28.34 A: yeah 

35.30 40.03 B: ah there's a point to learn computers but we can't have computers do the work for us 

39.48 40.55 A: right 

40.31 51.40 B: you know for instance you know th- the thing where they go off in high school they talk about calculators you know ah again rely rely on calculators to the point like for me i'm i'm my ah 

51.58 54.90 B: (( weakness is in mathematics because i rely on calculators like you wouldn't believe )) 

52.96 53.80 A: yeah 

54.27 58.19 A: i had to have my calculator i can't use my brain cause i'm use it being there [noise] [noise] [noise] 

58.35 61.66 B: yeah same same here i'm mean i i'm good at 

61.85 64.14 B: ah like for instance music and english 

64.33 71.67 B: ah mathematics is my weakness now i rely on computers for my mathematics that's suffered for a while i was using um 

72.09 80.26 B: ah i i stayed away from calculators i use my brain only and i found that i got stronger in mathematics lately ah ah i've 

80.65 86.23 B: been a bit working you know working a lot i don't have time to really sit there and really write things down i just a calculator 

85.90 87.05 A: yeah 

86.52 91.71 B: so i use a computer in that sense i use a computer to for children to think for them 

91.81 92.83 B: (( ah )) 

93.46 97.92 B: you know add things up set things up graphs for them um 

98.33 108.80 B: it's [mn] good for em to learn to use it but if they rely on using it all the time they [noise] it it that handicaps them now they learn how to use graphs for instance graphs 

109.33 112.85 B: constantly and then learn how to use on the computer but still work on 

113.19 115.75 B: on graphs you know with pen and paper 

116.22 118.82 B: that would be exceptionally beneficial there 

119.52 121.11 A: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] [noise] and [noise] i agree [noise] )) 

121.60 124.22 A: cause ah when [noise] i was in school [noise] 

126.04 131.97 A: nowadays everything is going to computers and if i didn't learn it in school then i probably wouldn't have learned it at all 

131.87 133.79 B: yeah 

133.26 138.09 A: and like now work at work we have to put all the stuff in the computer and i'm like mhm 

138.95 144.55 A: and it does have its pros and it's cons like you said with maths you're using the calculator 

145.18 151.90 A: that's you know put a downer on a bunch of us because now we rely on that calculator cause it's just so convenient 

152.03 153.31 B: yeah 

152.76 156.57 A: because i know i rely on it i'm like i can't think let me use the calculator 

156.19 160.51 B: [laughter] same here same here exactly [mn] 

159.95 162.94 A: cause it it's easy but yet 

163.16 165.63 A: there's big pros and cons because 

166.13 170.30 A: you rely on it so much you don't want to actually use your brain 

171.20 174.43 A: (( you know you just want to rely on that computer that machine )) 

175.63 176.47 A: so 

176.24 185.90 B: exactly um i know that example but for this ah i'm i'm a musician i play guitar and other instruments mostly guitar 

182.15 183.34 A: mhm 

185.98 200.07 B: um i'm finding ah nowadays technology is taking place of a lot of things the tricks and stuff they used do in the past for instance ah we have a thing on the guitar called the whammy bar [mn] one of the tremolo bar 

194.04 194.88 A: mhm 

200.11 204.64 B: um we can do a lot of things with it you can drop or raise a tune a tone on it 

204.17 205.34 A: mhm 

204.71 207.96 B: now they have computerized device that do it for them 

207.36 208.34 A: yeah 

208.08 214.28 B: also a wa pedal now the thing is it's the only set so much you can't improvise or really do something 

214.23 223.43 B: you're not as flexible but the problem it's it's going towards that where now a lot of musicians don't have the ear don't have the skill they're using ah 

223.49 224.82 B: machines 

224.83 227.63 B: to play to play to enhance their playing 

227.70 231.19 B: in the sense of being part them [mn] we call in 

231.68 234.84 B: in the music industry um they'll 

234.97 237.10 B: (( have the devices will )) 

237.13 241.07 B: replay what they're playing as they're playing it makes it play sound like they're playing faster 

240.70 241.64 A: right 

241.53 245.03 B: ah that takes that means there is less skill needed 

244.55 245.59 A: yeah 

245.24 246.41 B: um 

246.83 252.12 B: well and it lost things as harmonizes where in the past musicians used to um 

249.88 250.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

252.99 259.61 B: [mn] two guitarists would harmonize a solo that requires a- an understand of harmony perfect timing 

259.81 265.90 B: and a lot of practice that right there is a skill being developed um well that has been taken away 

263.05 263.93 A: mhm 

265.29 266.43 A: yeah 

266.15 270.28 B: um you can for five hundred dollars you can by a process that does everything wa 

270.56 274.72 B: like a wa pedal talk box everything ah we we put that 

275.06 282.74 B: i guess that that w- that direction that philosophy into the schools we'll wind up with kids coming out and the school system is suffering 

282.59 283.62 A: yeah 

282.76 286.14 B: not not just financially here i'm at they're doing a lot of cuts 

286.20 290.47 B: ah but the kids are suffering even without the cuts um 

290.58 293.82 B: they're not working they don't seem to be as into 

294.22 298.58 B: into school i mean kids are never really into school but they are even less 

298.15 299.09 A: mhm 

299.03 304.57 B: i mean when kids used to in the past play games like hopscotch or games of a 

304.93 311.42 B: a you know playing ball or any kind of team sports now they're in- indoors with a a nintendo 

311.16 311.95 A: yep 

311.88 315.13 B: so now their activities are sitting down in front of the t._v. 

315.20 324.38 A: and that's why you know like with sports and that they rather sit in front of the t._v. than go out there and play football and sports and keep the money for your support programs 

323.95 330.75 B: [mn] exactly um a lot of that too affects the behavior um with develop ah developing ah 

329.05 330.19 A: yep 

330.76 338.69 B: social social skills ah they're learning social skills by playing mortal combat rather than playing the sport team sport where 

338.73 341.30 B: they help each work as a team 

340.87 341.76 A: mhm 

341.48 348.35 B: now they're just doing it as a fighting thing um this is you know plus with other influences coming in 

348.26 356.59 B: this is causing a a major it's causing a problem with the school districts the district the school itself i mean i have worked in many schools as a sub and i've seen ah 

351.79 352.96 A: (( yep [noise] )) 

357.07 359.59 B: ah you know you see the repercussions of ah 

359.72 363.32 B: these habits that these k- you know kids are involved in 

363.82 378.01 B: um you'll see ah lot of th- there might be some little social gatherings but they're more cliquish than before more closed in and kind of like how the gangs are really closed in with themselves and hostile to others 

375.95 377.06 A: mhm 

377.91 378.99 A: yep 

378.37 386.42 B: even these kids are not in in gangs that way of thinking they're still coming out um you see a lot more problems a lot of 

386.72 392.11 B: kids are more likely to ditch now than before we've seen a lot of the problems that when i was in high school 

392.22 400.23 B: are been augmented and even ah weren't existing when i was in school and grade school when i was in grade school i'd walk in to ah 

400.41 402.43 B: campus and i felt safe 

402.55 408.50 B: um this last year i was working in an elementary school and a child brought some ammunition 

408.03 409.24 A: (( phew gosh )) 

409.16 410.22 B: and a gun 

410.31 411.43 A: (( oh [cough] )) 

410.81 411.82 B: sixth grader 

411.83 414.81 B: this is a sixth grader and that's 

413.67 416.19 A: that's what's the worlds coming to now because [noise] 

416.84 419.04 A: and um that's a whole other subject [laughter] 

417.12 417.87 B: (( phew )) 

418.88 425.36 B: yeah ah it actually does tie in with the subject of computers because if you think about it what sells computer games 

425.49 427.89 B: mostly violent games 

427.11 428.12 A: (( ahah )) 

428.12 440.10 B: and so now the kids are behaving is what they see and what they hear in their music which b- basically what they're listening to is computerized i mean like the rap all the stuff is just computerized rummaging 

432.23 433.88 A: yep 

440.33 442.44 B: um even the pop music nowadays 

441.95 443.70 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

442.59 448.44 B: um there's there's cons there [mn] when the computer does the work for the person 

448.79 449.81 B: um 

449.98 453.70 B: people are less not they don't think for themselves 

454.04 454.91 B: um 

455.57 457.47 A: they allow a computer to do it [noise] [mn] 

457.18 458.76 B: yeah and ah 

459.48 461.61 B: but what we need to do is 

462.46 464.54 B: have a a line drawn 

464.83 469.00 B: here is what a computer can do for you but do it for yourself 

468.39 469.28 A: yeah 

469.59 476.47 B: um where i'm t- or where i'm working at the kids right now are just learning how to type and how to us ah wor- you know 

474.62 476.93 A: mhm [noise] the basic functions 

476.53 480.68 B: the basic functions there's nothing really i don't see any threat in this 

480.83 482.75 B: i don't see them um 

483.38 485.21 B: (( becoming ah )) 

485.25 489.32 B: in the brain of this actually in this sense in this class it would be beneficial 

488.92 490.21 A: mhm 

489.86 493.18 B: um it's when what could later on you know 

492.32 493.27 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

493.33 494.44 B: um 

494.94 502.83 B: with you know what can happen later on right now the way i see it i'm for com- computer education in schools i'm all for it i just think it should be ah 

503.08 504.96 B: looked at under a microscope 

504.70 505.86 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

505.25 510.98 B: and make sure that we do not overdo it or do not ah cross the line that seems to be crossed 

511.17 513.56 B: [mn] not to be crossed i'm sorry you know 

513.73 514.61 B: (( ah )) 

514.72 520.54 B: because ah as you know computers get more advances just for the companies to make money 

520.59 525.55 B: they want to be not just user friendly but easier for the person to just get their job done 

525.16 526.48 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

525.77 536.29 B: and doing that it's just like for instance in the past when people before machines were made people were a much better fit they had to do things carpenters had to everything was hand tools 

535.91 537.09 A: mhm 

536.47 538.55 B: nowadays we use machines 

537.93 539.40 A: yeah 

538.64 543.51 B: um i mean when [mn] back in the days when they had a shovel to pull 

543.67 556.43 B: to do work there's the pros and cons on that i mean they got more work done with the machines but now you see people with more health problems being inactive and we don't want this happening with um 

551.04 552.85 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

553.28 554.05 A: yeah 

554.97 556.08 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] 

556.79 558.84 B: our children's b- minds 

559.06 563.11 B: being ah closed minded not able to have critical thinking 

563.66 569.78 B: so computers need to be the slaves of the people in the sense because they're machines you know 

569.60 570.39 A: mhm 

570.02 573.10 B: be be in our control we need to be the critical thinkers 

573.77 581.47 B: but they need to be like the ones that do the some of the quick adding up because they can they can calculate very quickly 

581.75 582.92 A: (( yep [noise] )) 

582.30 586.27 B: but as long i mean i was just watching today a a thing on t._v. about 

586.28 591.45 B: how machines are getting so advanced in twenty years they might be replacing people 

590.82 591.90 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

592.08 594.46 A: especially factories and things [noise] 

594.10 599.30 B: exactly exactly factories i mean we have a lot of people going out of work 

598.82 599.89 A: (( yeah because of ma- ))
