0.08 1.25 A: hello 

0.97 2.94 B: hi how are you 

1.84 2.77 A: (( hi )) 

2.89 5.78 A: my name's cricket i'm from southern california 

5.62 11.88 B: hi my name is johan and i live in illinois i'm from yugoslavia originally 

11.28 17.24 A: oh right great okay so our com- our topic is ah computers in the school system 

16.84 18.00 B: yes 

17.39 30.07 A: um well i think it's a great thing i think that um the the kids need to know everything they can about computers because the way technology is and by the time they get ah grown up or our age 

29.93 32.51 A: everything is going to be 

32.75 44.94 A: automated everything's run by computers and if they don't learn it at a a young age i mean they're they're gonna be stuck they're gonna be left out in the dark um i just i think it's a great thing um how 'bout you 

43.88 50.59 B: yeah i agree but i have some little disagreement with computer 

48.71 49.67 A: okay 

50.55 60.31 B: (( because when you're on computers you only learn like some proceeds you know press this button press this button press this )) 

60.51 75.24 B: and like in that the statistic disciplines you simply don't need to know like formal or for anything else is simply like putting putting data in the system and the system do everything for you 

75.04 78.55 B: but you don't don't know the principles 

78.34 83.70 A: right right well i understand that but in the in the school system um 

83.76 94.43 A: kids on computers they learn how to type they learn motor skills ah a lot of the children ah have attention deficit problems these days we can't keep them interested 

94.25 109.05 A: and i would think instead of having them you know running wild in the classroom not learning anything that there's so many programs through the computers out there that would keep their interest that that way they would at least be learning something you know 

107.90 109.62 B: yes that's true 

109.45 115.28 A: um ah also being here in california we do have a lot of computers in the school system 

115.21 125.99 A: um you know how we have to pay for generally you pay for books or paper and everything year after year after year or the teachers are having to print out ah tests or assignment type things 

119.42 120.38 B: yes 

125.78 136.40 A: well if they have the computers um i think that's gonna save a lot of money because everything's gonna be right there on the computer they don't have to have paper pencil um print outs for tests they can 

136.21 147.78 A: enter everything right there into the computer um well that's gonna save a bunch of money because it's you know and it's always gonna be there on the computer so they don't have to keep redoing and redoing and redoing you know 

148.15 151.36 A: by you know having to print out stuff and 

148.48 149.30 B: (( [mn] )) 

151.29 154.47 B: yeah you only have the expense to buy the computer 

154.23 156.50 A: [laughter] yeah 

155.63 158.36 B: (( sometimes it's time to upgrades )) 

157.86 159.94 A: right right right 

158.93 161.62 B: i mean that's also not cheap you 

162.14 163.43 A: right 

162.35 168.79 B: (( know i'm in computers they only last three four five six years then you need to buy a new one )) 

166.10 167.35 A: right same here 

168.53 169.45 A: right 

169.29 172.11 B: (( so i don't think that's gonna [laughter] too much )) 

172.66 173.84 B: savings 

173.72 183.69 A: well the only reason you really have to buy new ones um pretty much is if you use up your hard drive or your memory or you're on the internet now in the schools i mean sure they have some 

183.50 193.25 A: classes or whatever that might be internet related but generally um the kids aren't even on the internet um and for what they're using the computers for 

193.06 205.69 A: you really don't have to upgrade unless you're ah changing ah the tests or the programs or what they're leaning i mean you know we could be using the old four eighty sixes right now to sit down and take the same test that somebody took ten years ago 

205.09 206.27 B: [sigh] yes 

205.51 213.79 A: you you know so they're really i don't think that there's an upgrade issue um you know as for computers in the schools not really 

213.70 219.16 B: well i have know about illinois some schools because i was learning the english 

218.84 219.66 A: (( uh-huh )) 

219.81 221.69 B: so i was the some 

221.92 231.25 B: like i was in college having classes but i was also like in some elementary schools having classes because they don't have enough space 

230.82 232.17 A: right 

231.58 241.70 B: so they can like old computers like four eighty six and they can do more or less anything with them they're like too behind 

238.27 239.83 A: right right right 

241.79 245.69 A: yeah well they're too behind why because 

245.90 260.25 A: only if they're on the internet if you're just using ah a computer for word processing ah type things which most of the schools that's what they're doing um you know they're just running some program or or test or having them read some information 

260.17 263.91 A: um why would you have to upgrade the computer to be able to 

264.26 266.65 A: just you know do basic things 

266.12 273.90 B: yeah but but you have other things not only the word processing i think computers can do lot more so 

273.31 279.40 A: right they can do a lot more but it's a matter of whether the school's going to be having those computers do 

279.22 280.25 B: yeah 

279.40 287.67 A: you know whether they're going to actually be doing on those computers you know as long as they're not surfing around the internet or they're doing major graphic programs or 

287.48 301.62 A: playing games or or you know video type stuff like that um the upgrade on a a system like that um would be minimal you know um what every five years you might have to upgrade a computer um 

301.84 310.37 A: and by then they'd just trade them in and and you know new ones come out and it's probably a tax write off for somebody somewhere [laughter] you know 

309.25 311.34 B: (( [laughter] )) 

312.19 325.30 A: you know and by having computers in the schools ah also keep other people ah employed people that have to come in and maintain the computers set up the networking ah you know as you said there if they need upgrades so 

319.74 321.36 B: yeah the the 

325.25 334.97 A: it's not just a matter of ah the kids getting benefit from it it's ah actually benefitting different ah branches of society as a whole you know um 

335.53 339.32 A: i don't know i think computers in in the schools is a great thing we have them in a 

339.60 342.88 A: most if all the schools right here in california 

342.68 347.66 A: um they've got some kind of computer lab at least in in the school itself 

347.45 361.47 A: i think it would be great that every child had its own um computer you know at least monitor into the network at their desk you know the heck with the books get rid of the books get rid of the paper and pencil and um there it is it's right there 

360.18 361.23 B: yes 

361.82 365.22 B: yeah is is only wrong that they gonna put 

365.42 368.73 B: some memory chip in the future in the kid's brain 

367.35 369.82 A: right right right right right right right 

368.74 371.14 B: they're gonna end it in that way 

370.86 381.32 A: well you know memory chips are gonna be cheaper than having to replace books every year or as i said you know printing out the the information for each student ah for each semester ah 

381.12 390.66 A: and on down the line here in california when a kid goes to school the school supplies the paper pencil you know and things like that for them i know um other 

389.78 392.86 B: yeah that that could be expensive hundreds 

392.08 406.32 A: right then that does get expensive extremely expensive but that's something they do here in california now you know you get the computers in on in to each desk and you don't have to do that every year supply supplies for each child 

394.37 395.50 B: yeah 

404.86 406.56 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

407.02 407.81 A: (( huh )) 

407.52 417.60 B: yeah that's true i know i was working for and during like back to school people are spending enormous amounts of money on supplies 

416.01 416.77 A: oh 

417.05 425.12 A: huge i remember i was i grew up in washington and you know every year my mom had would go out for school supplies for the three kids in the house and i mean 

424.95 436.26 A: and it's just outrageous ah the things that you have to pay for school supplies now if the schools had the computers i mean they'd be saving people money it it'd be employing people and at the same time ah 

436.80 445.94 A: educating our children on the ways of the future 'cause that's just the way it's gonna be you know we're running out of trees to make paper [laughter] you know 

440.95 442.05 B: yeah 

444.56 446.25 B: (( mm yeah )) 

446.66 449.65 A: so i i'm not i think there's a lot of good benefits 

448.26 449.32 B: yeah but see 

449.49 453.73 B: we are also running out of the sources for the electricity in a way 

453.53 455.17 A: [laughter] 

453.95 456.91 B: (( so what's gonna be rely [laughter] )) 

455.78 459.78 A: well we're gonna run off the sun and all computers are gonna be solar powered here soon 

459.65 463.29 B: oh yeah i hope so [laughter] 

459.82 461.82 A: [laughter] 

461.91 467.76 A: well you know we got the little calculators and things like that there's no reason why it can't happen that way 

465.31 466.59 B: yeah i know 

467.01 472.58 B: yeah they can but i think they still don't wanna put that to the market 

472.00 477.17 A: yeah you know the the technology isn't as fast as ah 

477.28 481.59 A: change is you know anything is possible [laughter] 

479.28 486.31 B: (( yeah but you're in california at least you have a lot of sun we don't have that much in illinois [laughter] )) 

485.45 497.58 A: right i just spoke with somebody in new york and you know ah they don't have computers in any of the schools down there well you know california we're probably the most modern state in the united states and i'm down here in san diego ah 

497.47 498.37 A: the 

498.26 504.43 A: richest ah most expensive place to live in the [laughter] united states darn near you know so our kids 

501.68 502.79 B: oh okay 

504.32 512.06 A: um probably benefit because they do have more than other places so i guess i gotta look at it that way too i mean we've got 

511.83 526.01 A: great schools and great ah s._a._t. scores coming out of our schools down here and that's because of the way um the school systems are able to supply and teach and you know provide for our children in in a classroom structure 

526.10 532.86 A: so you know i'm sure it's it seems like it's pretty different down here than it is everywhere else so i just have to 

531.58 533.48 B: (( ah could be )) 

533.07 538.12 A: yeah you know but i think everybody should be like we are [laughter] 

537.17 540.19 B: well in the future i guess [laughter] 

539.96 544.95 A: in the future yes you guys will catch up with us [laughter] you know 

542.37 543.28 B: yeah 

543.73 546.73 B: i mean it takes time but 

546.12 560.96 A: right in the meantime you know our children um are learning um at a faster rate i hate to say than um possibly the children in your schools you know which to me is is kinda sad you know um i think 

560.96 570.51 A: children in all schools should have the same advantage you know i think all the all the schools everywhere should be run the same everybody should have the same not 

570.44 580.57 A: ah our kids get better education than yours um because we've got more i mean it which that's you know that's not ah good that's kind of a downfall there um 

573.78 575.24 B: yeah 

580.56 588.54 A: you know if everybody could can afford the computers or at least be the same then all the kids would um grow up learning the same things you know i 

588.80 594.84 A: guess that's the difference between going to an expensive college or just a community college too at the same time 

594.93 595.98 A: (( you know )) 

595.66 598.36 B: well in a way yes but you know 

598.42 599.89 B: (( you're gonna learn ))
