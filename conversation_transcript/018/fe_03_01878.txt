6.28 8.44 A: hi my name is stephanie seymour 

8.77 10.62 A: i'm in philadelphia pennsylvania 

12.60 16.42 B: well this is the first time i have done this um how about you 

16.10 17.88 A: ah this is my second time 

17.84 23.00 B: oh okay i read about it on um one of the mystery shop boards 

23.08 30.06 A: yeah i i was forwarded ah from i was forwarded this from an email um from somebody i knew 

29.85 30.83 B: mhm 

30.52 35.65 A: and um the topic that we are discussing right now is family and what family means to you 

35.99 39.22 A: um i can i can start um i think 

36.11 37.33 B: mhm 

37.89 38.72 B: okay 

39.57 43.67 A: family is very important to me personally um 

45.18 47.07 A: i have ah 

47.35 55.45 A: you know i'm i'm the youngest of four daughters my m- mother is still alive and my father had passed away a while ago and 

56.02 64.42 A: um some of my sisters i'm a little closer to than others and in in some sense it's very dis- it it is a little disappointing 

64.56 65.69 A: but i do 

65.83 70.37 A: feel that family should come first in some respects 

70.95 71.89 A: um 

72.10 79.67 A: i i feel this way personally because i've been working on i'm also a writer and i've been kind of working on my writing career and 

80.54 81.60 A: you know i 

81.80 91.72 A: i know deep down my family does support me i know my si- well my mother does definitely she vis- visibly does show her support and i'm sure my other sisters do too but 

92.12 93.65 A: you know sometimes 

93.97 99.53 A: like if they go to an event that i'm involved in sometimes they can't always come because they are always busy or 

99.89 102.10 A: and that's understandable and 

102.52 114.23 A: i've had to learn to re- to resign the fact that it is the thought that counts sometimes maybe they they wish they could be there or sometimes they can't you know at least two of my sisters feel that way 

114.56 115.54 A: and 

115.87 122.08 A: you know my father's side of the family i really don't know that well because i guess my my mother 

122.31 126.86 A: wasn't very close to her in laws so there's kind of like a gap there 

126.79 128.56 B: mhm 

127.04 129.80 A: in that sense so it's kind of like you know 

130.89 139.51 A: you know i don't know which one of my aunts or uncles are still alive [laughter] you know that that kind of thing so and i try to ask my mother about these things and she really doesn't know 

142.24 143.34 A: (( so you know mhm )) 

142.44 151.61 B: well i come from a small family of just two daughters and my sister lives in iowa so there is really 

146.44 147.22 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

151.58 158.87 B: not any contact um between us she has got a life in iowa and i am here in cincinnati 

158.99 169.73 B: and i believe that through the years we have just become more distant and certain family fallings outs have just stuck through the years 

163.53 164.47 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

170.01 175.53 B: and i think i have come to see there are families we have a family that we're born into and then 

175.61 178.15 B: our family of choice 

178.49 179.53 B: and when 

179.68 185.02 B: we've needed help or needed support it's been our family of choice that's really been there 

185.60 191.14 B: my husband just underwent a kidney transplant he comes from a family of nine 

190.79 191.73 A: mhm 

191.66 193.24 B: and out of 

193.28 197.81 B: the all the siblings nobody would step forward to be tested even 

197.49 198.32 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

198.68 200.57 B: so that was disappointing 

200.35 202.23 A: (( yeah that that is disappointing )) 

202.05 203.90 B: right and you know 

204.86 208.21 B: so we created i guess our own little family of 

208.51 214.64 B: the people that were you know supportive of us and we we could depend on those people 

212.35 213.27 A: right 

214.71 226.31 B: and then it was funny because they there were there to help us if we needed help and then afterwards um there were no expectations no 

226.48 227.58 B: um 

228.20 236.64 B: there's there's people who i consider friends but more like family that i could not talk to them for a couple of months and then 

235.56 236.36 A: right 

237.41 243.35 B: pick up the conversation where we left off and its like nothing where i think 

239.74 240.64 A: mhm 

241.89 242.76 A: right 

243.33 253.10 B: a lot of people i know their families there's all this bickering over well you went to her house on christmas and you didn't come to my house and there's a lot of pettiness 

251.08 252.18 A: yeah 

253.79 259.08 A: yeah that i guess that's one thing i am thankful for on on some levels i mean i 

259.18 261.65 A: mean there is some pettiness i mean 

261.99 268.72 A: you know unfortunately we have a house full of women i mean as wrong as this sounds sometimes you can't avoid it 

265.33 266.05 B: mhm 

268.02 269.11 B: right 

269.02 270.05 A: (( because i )) 

269.19 273.83 B: but they can be they will be there for you if you need them is that 

272.34 273.21 A: right 

273.92 276.73 B: that's good if you feel like they will be there 

274.88 275.74 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

277.32 281.88 B: you can imagine how my husband felt when he was needing a kidney and then 

279.64 280.57 A: right 

282.13 285.31 B: it's like everybody disappears into the woods 

284.67 288.10 A: yeah that that had to have been heartbreaking i'm sure right 

287.46 294.78 B: well i think i saw it being a woman i was a little more perceptive to what was not said before 

295.46 304.53 B: it really happened um he was still waiting for them to think about it and i said this is not a thinking thing if 

304.79 306.76 B: they're going to do it they're gonna 

307.46 308.70 B: contact you 

309.12 312.46 B: and after two weeks i said 

312.53 314.04 B: they're not gonna do it 

314.23 324.93 B: and he's like well let them think about it a little while longer i said no no we just need to get a final no from them and then they would proceed to test me because they were hesitant 

320.97 321.92 A: (( and )) 

325.15 328.85 A: and i see that and you know if if one of my sisters 

330.03 331.09 A: (( you know )) 

331.11 335.46 A: they needed help or they needed donation or this or that or whatever i mean 

336.68 339.45 A: that's one of those things i wouldn't give it a second thought 

339.75 340.86 B: mhm 

340.10 347.47 A: and i'm sure like they would feel that way too and well maybe like two of my sisters i don't know about my older sister 'cause 

347.63 352.15 A: she's just off in her own little world she she had gotten married recently [laughter] 

351.65 352.60 B: mhm 

352.20 357.99 A: and this is how my my older sister she's the type of person she really doesn't contact you 

358.01 360.62 A: contact anyone unless she wants something from them 

360.49 361.80 B: mhm 

361.01 367.38 A: so i heard she's been doing she's been a little more friendly ever since she got married according to my mother but um 

364.99 366.20 B: yeah 

368.20 369.13 A: well 

369.41 374.80 A: you know with my brother in law i met my brother in law for like the first time at the wedding 

374.97 376.27 B: (( what )) 

375.88 377.50 A: yeah so 

377.03 378.53 B: that was kind of 

378.77 385.19 A: i mean i had another opportunity to meet him before but i just i just couldn't at the time but it's just 

385.23 392.75 A: i mean my mother met him once one of my other sisters met him once and then i have another sister who lives in norris town which is a suburb of philadelphia 

392.43 393.89 B: mhm 

392.91 397.24 A: so she's pretty she's like the furthest from us like everybody pretty much lives in the city 

397.61 404.60 A: and um yeah she met him for the first time at that time too so i mean he seems like a nice guy so 

405.02 406.99 A: but yeah so it's kind of 

407.30 413.04 A: that kind of closeness and i just kind of at that time i really had some strong feelings 

413.07 416.12 A: as well as my other sister 'cause it's kind of like i kind of felt 

416.44 423.88 A: left out of the whole process and i know it's like it's a whole wedding thing and it's all about you know the bride and the groom and everything but it's kind of like 

425.37 431.70 A: you know you could have took a few minutes out of your time to bring him around and introduce him to us before you got married 

430.35 434.00 B: well i think our expectations just get 

434.11 440.24 B: so our expectations are higher than what it can really be in any given situation with family 

440.05 440.98 A: mhm 

440.86 441.64 B: and 

441.88 448.63 B: to expect anything less than being you know somehow slighted it seems to be setting 

448.64 451.86 B: myself up for for a a letdown 

451.45 452.43 A: mhm 

452.60 458.49 B: so i you know i've tried to become just oh just matter of fact about it 

458.01 459.25 A: mhm 

458.63 459.32 B: i 

459.43 461.89 B: lower my expectations i guess 

461.69 465.89 A: yeah i've i've had to do that's something i i had to learn the hard way too 

465.76 467.01 B: yep [laughter] 

466.53 469.90 A: it's really difficult but it's i have to tell like 

467.96 468.91 B: oh 

470.02 472.66 A: this is how this person is you know 

473.15 477.42 A: i have to i mean yeah maybe it's not right and maybe i can complain about it or 

477.53 480.65 A: whatever or think or do this but i'd say 

481.01 488.94 A: that's how it is and it's like you know i didn't feel it was it was a good thing you know to finally meet this guy for the first time on a wedding day but 

488.35 491.04 B: no i mean it must have been uncomfortable 

488.98 490.45 A: i was like well 

491.60 495.11 A: (( it's like you know well this is how she is you know [laughter] see )) 

495.28 497.24 B: well did she know him very long 

497.91 501.06 A: (( here's another thing [laughter] it's like )) 

501.22 512.68 A: see we're i'm not very close with my older sister i don't really talk to her that much 'cause i it's just that we have a really pers- we have a personality clash and she just throws me the wrong way [laughter] 

509.44 510.34 B: mhm 

512.02 512.90 B: mhm 

512.78 522.62 A: and this has just happened as i got older and developing my own sense of identity and and view of things it's just they're very different from hers so it 

520.63 521.66 B: mhm 

523.98 525.05 A: you know 

525.35 533.20 A: i didn't really know much about the courtship or about how i mean i knew they met on on the job because i know they work for the same company 

533.21 537.95 A: but i think it was like maybe a little less than a year before they decided to get engaged 

538.32 545.20 A: the only reason she really wanted to get engaged i mean she wanted to get married because like her son is going to be going to school in a couple of years so 

544.54 545.64 B: mhm 

545.70 550.51 A: and she's she was a single mother she's not single any more but you know she really didn't 

547.92 548.98 B: mhm 

550.26 552.17 B: you think she's pregnant now 

552.62 559.27 A: no i she's not pregnant now i don't yeah i don't think she's interested in having any more children because she's like in her mid forties 

558.83 561.31 B: but i mean do you think that's what made the wedding so 

561.32 562.24 B: quick 

562.62 564.98 A: no i think she was just 

565.14 566.70 A: scared of being alone 

566.59 567.41 B: oh 

567.05 575.31 A: after her my son is i mean my not my son i don't have any children my nephew is not going to college for another two years so it's kind of like 

575.71 578.21 A: (( she could have had some more time you know [laughter] )) 

577.04 582.20 B: she could have got a dog or a cat [laughter] 

579.66 582.59 A: well she's not big she's not big on animals 

582.65 583.73 B: (( wow )) 

583.84 590.68 A: what's shocking about that is that we we always had pets in our house so [laughter] i guess it was like an exception to the rule 

587.97 589.01 B: (( well )) 

590.69 594.23 B: she got the husband he's going to take the place of a dog or cat 

594.51 599.89 A: well yeah in that sense but you know my son i mean not my son i keep saying it my nephew is still
