0.01 2.39 B: hello this is regina speaking 

2.00 4.14 A: hi my name is christina 

3.76 5.50 B: hi christina how are ya 

5.12 6.60 A: i'm good how are you 

6.19 17.46 B: okay so let's see they said the topic of well for me this evening is ah computers basically computers in schools whether they hurt or harm education 

18.75 19.49 A: (( ahah )) 

19.57 30.54 B: okay well personally i'm let's see personally i would say i grew up in like the cusp of the computer age ah i went to high school during the 

30.61 33.69 B: ah the mid eighties from eighty four to eighty seven 

33.61 40.94 B: so that is when computers were really starting to make an inroad that's when apple was popular when apple was the big thing 

40.84 52.63 B: and so one of the first things i actually learnt other than the basics of the keyboard was actually early computer programming which was basic i don't know if you remember basic way back then 

52.45 58.92 A: [noise] no actually 'cause i um i went to high school in [mn] the mid nineties 

58.36 66.58 B: okay so for you it was like it was a totally different thing computers were just already on the scene technology was just improving whereas when i went 

66.56 77.24 B: computer technology in the classroom was just getting started and everybody i knew who was taking a a computer class wasn't really so much about learning 

77.58 85.73 B: ah software because software really hadn't taken off it was about learning programming whether it was d._o._s. 

86.17 96.83 B: or basic or actually i think i had friends that learned ah cobol [laughter] this this is this is really dating me in some respects but ah 

92.00 93.08 A: [laughter] 

96.88 107.44 B: personally i think um just just starting off learning from that was just a springboard to ah getting more involved in ah other types of 

107.48 109.57 B: ah computer technology 

109.65 112.52 B: i mean at at this stage of the game 

112.71 121.30 B: if we did not have computer technology it is almost like going backwards to to to everything that we do from um 

121.69 131.69 B: doing business at your bank to checking your bank statements to writing your papers i don't think i i know of anybody who is going to sit down at a typewriter now 

131.47 132.68 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

131.84 138.68 B: [laughter] and literally type on to a piece of paper and having to deal with correction ribbon if they make a mistake to be perfectly honest 

139.34 142.24 B: and let me not just hog the conversation here [laughter] 

141.44 144.19 A: [laughter] well i 

144.33 153.87 A: i remember when i was in high school we did a little bit of the programming and learning to to do all that and um it was 

154.11 163.47 A: it was confusing you know 'cause like we were used to the software and all that and then trying to figure out how to do 

164.75 168.92 A: all that other stuff was just it didn't work [laughter] 

167.69 180.28 B: [laughter] i i i i guess i can i guess i can get what you are saying because now i'm so i'm so caught up in it now if you were to ask me to try and sit down and learn computer programming now 

180.21 183.28 B: i would be like you've got to be kidding [laughter] 

182.38 188.00 A: yeah because you're so used to what you have now used to how easy it is 

185.33 186.84 B: yeah and and 

187.34 200.45 B: right and ah now i'm i'm trying to keep to the topic does does it hurt or harm education i don't see computer technology harming education in any way because for 

200.36 212.23 B: ah you know for the toddlers and their little what i like to call their little play computers not that they would have a laptop or anything like that but those little simple basic comp- ah 

212.21 221.21 B: i forget what are those preschool type computers that they have where they can just learn the the play basics of letters and numbers and what not 

218.49 219.53 A: mhm 

221.11 234.72 B: to maybe your first or second grader getting on to like a basic computer and playing age appropriate ah games or doing age appropriate educational programs they have so much software out there 

234.61 243.59 B: that it's impossible i think not to find something on a on a ah technological level that's not going to intrigue their minds 

243.46 255.63 B: whether it's art or music or [lipsmack] goodness what they just have so much stuff and i myself don't have any children as of yet but i just see um 

255.78 269.82 B: i just see where kids take off with it i mean i was thought to be the technological whiz to my parents because i'm always the one that has to sit down and and type the letters or with my boss who's who 

267.02 268.04 A: [laughter] 

269.87 278.37 B: who she grew up in the age of wang i'm like wang [laughter] i mean as- ask a modern day high schooler now what's like wang what's wang 

272.87 274.63 A: [laughter] 

278.19 287.26 B: wang is like one of those early computer ah com- computer companies they still exist but don't ask me what they are doing now [laughter] 

286.24 297.27 A: yeah well i think like you said you know the computers are good for education but i think that they can also harm like when i went to school and i had computer classes 

297.16 310.65 A: most of the time all we did was get on the internet and chat rooms and things like that and i think that that aspect can hurt kids if they're allowed to do that because they are not learning anything useful 

299.85 300.96 B: mhm 

302.61 304.01 B: (( right yeah )) 

310.40 317.65 B: that's true i see that is that is the other flipside to the coin because the other people the other reason why people love computers so much is 

317.60 320.90 B: access to the worldwide web and it is just ah 

320.84 333.96 B: i don't c- i don't want to call it a big waste land but for a kid it is like a big old candy store and i can get whatever i want ah if your parents or your teachers aren't looking over your shoulders to say 

326.73 327.77 A: right 

333.86 336.58 B: why are you here [laughter] what are you doing 

336.25 338.29 A: yeah and so many 

338.37 342.79 A: sites that are inappropriate have names that 

343.02 352.85 A: would be for you know like if you are looking up the government's website and you type in a little something wrong then something inappropriate comes up and if a kid comes along that 

348.81 349.79 B: mhm 

353.54 355.18 A: you know what are they to do 

354.72 361.18 B: yeah it's like they're just going to sit and an average typical kid is just going to wind up finding out what he can find out 

360.27 361.30 A: [laughter] 

361.03 369.75 B: an- and the funny thing is is that ah you know you try to pol- you try to police it parents try to police this teachers try to police it they try to put in 

369.76 371.21 B: for every 

371.33 375.43 B: ah precaution that you try to take somebody is always trying to get around it [laughter] 

375.21 376.22 A: yeah 

375.62 386.21 B: so it's so it's basically just a constant fight but i would say in general i don't think anybody wants to go back to the day of ah of a whole lot of pen and paper 

385.82 389.27 A: right in general computers i think are just wonderful 

388.85 400.37 B: yes i that that i couldn't that i couldn't deny you more because i like the fact that i can do my spreadsheets do my research ah type my articles 

392.43 393.46 A: [laughter] 

400.36 412.45 B: research my grants well they are not my grants they are for my our boss i do other work in terms of trying to research grants for her arts and education 'cause she's like a small five oh one c. three 

412.43 417.89 B: and i feel for her so badly because um she's much older than i am she 

417.99 420.46 B: jus- just hit the cusp of sixty 

420.38 426.85 B: and all she did was wang and wang was entirely different we are not even talking about office productivity software 

426.37 426.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

426.77 429.63 B: which she could use desperately but 

426.98 427.74 A: right 

429.42 443.98 B: for her everything is ah the only thing she really mastered was email i'm like well it's a step in the right direction and i had to show her how to do it [laughter] it's a step in the right direction but i'm thinking in a business sense your productivity just sinks 

437.14 438.12 A: (( oh )) 

443.69 445.90 A: (( yeah yeah computers )) 

444.07 457.58 B: w- w- without knowing your office productivity basics i don't know a person around who doesn't have um [lipsmack] who doesn't have office some type of office with excel and windows and what not 

457.74 469.96 B: and oh it it it makes me cringe some of the stuff she tries to do i'm like oh not only do you need to take some classes believe me when i tell you but i don't think i see that forthcoming [laughter] 

462.93 464.27 A: [laughter] 

469.59 475.13 A: [laughter] yeah but in i think you also have to know a thorough knowledge of everything 

474.95 476.10 B: yeah 

475.25 478.84 A: because i started to work for my boss like a year ago 

478.81 492.73 A: and the person who worked for her before me had they had different databases and access well instead of using one database and kind of clearing different information from that database they had like twenty different databases 

492.14 493.23 B: mhm 

492.89 495.96 A: and it was horrible like if you wanted to enter in 

496.15 500.48 A: information you'd have to enter in the same information in twenty different databases 

500.05 502.40 B: ooh painful [laughter] 

501.61 508.25 A: yes yes and so you know then i kind of was like wait a second [laughter] this isn't working 

509.01 510.21 A: [laughter] so 

509.62 512.22 B: yeah but the thing is it works for them [laughter] 

511.75 512.92 A: right 

512.24 515.15 B: but it's but it's so unproductive 

514.67 516.93 A: yeah it's repetitive 

515.29 516.25 B: and tha- 

516.31 519.78 B: yes and and that's the thing with ah 

519.81 526.97 B: computers in education in general ah you streamline the the whole process 

527.19 534.40 B: and you can correct your errors at the same time and with whatever software you can study 

534.27 545.32 B: whatever subjects you wa- whatever subject you want and it it to me is just plain fascinating it's like and and the funny thing is it's just the springboard to ah 

545.48 559.44 B: learn ah just extend yourself into other technological aspects to be perfectly honest i mean started ah going online and looking up stuff on the internet and then it's like i wound up finding about um 

559.48 565.38 B: different types of technologies just because of that doggone thing they call a microchip 

565.39 568.15 B: and the microchip is where it all just got started [laughter] 

567.59 569.23 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

568.71 574.89 B: and and it's funny some technologies shrank really small i mean yea- oh 

574.91 583.74 B: yeah people are still holding people were holding on to their ah walkmans when i went to school walkmans were the big thing and now it's like everybody is like 

580.48 581.33 A: yeah 

584.32 595.64 B: i don't see anybody carrying a walkman everybody is now still holding on to their c._d.s where other parts of the country are like what are you holding on with that for it's like you've got mini disks now or m._p. three 

594.86 596.60 A: yeah the m._p. three 

596.46 599.89 B: (( so it feels like except i don't see too many of those i i see ))
