71.18 73.53 A: yeah i well i mean 

73.84 85.20 A: i guess the advantage and disadvantages that and advantage to using computers is be- like you said you just use them you have it at home and use it all in the workplace it's kind of a necessity right now 

85.54 89.80 A: um to i mean to know computer skills but um 

86.33 87.44 B: (( a like in a )) 

90.13 97.89 A: besides i mean just learning computer skills a lot of what they're trying to do is actually use computers to make the education process better 

98.13 101.75 A: in the fact that i mean the internet has some advantages 

101.79 102.50 B: (( public )) 

101.87 106.65 A: um that with the information that the students have available they can run out and 

105.60 113.34 B: (( you want to teach um oh that'll be i i have a friend who did e._s._l. but she was doing it at a um she was working with college students um not ))

120.72 122.54 A: (( well i want to teach overseas )) 

120.88 121.48 B: (( yes )) 

122.84 133.95 B: (( well our phone line tends to click a lot but i'm still here [laughter] mhm mhm mhm oh that would be interesting yeah mhm sure yes [laughter] definitely well yeah it's good for like if somebody was if you were in france and you had some students that )) 

128.96 129.85 A: okay 

133.60 134.44 A: okay 

134.80 138.97 A: yeah i and i would i i can't wait to go overseas i just love 

139.30 141.13 A: being over there i love working with 

141.40 148.82 A: ah [noise] internationals but other thing is i spent i've spent a lot of time in in classes on using computers are you still there 

149.27 153.34 A: okay okay i heard a click and i didn't know if i lost you i'm sorry about that um 

152.29 156.07 B: (( were trying to learn french and then they )) 

155.07 156.04 A: okay 

156.06 159.08 A: okay okay i just wanted to make sure i didn't lose you and i'm talking to 

159.18 171.56 A: nobody um i spent like a lot of time in classes that use that talk about using computers and they talk about like using chat rooms and then you know you can if you wanna teach 

171.88 184.85 A: english to students overseas you can find classes like i could find i have friends over in america here who teach high school and i could get them who teach high school and then i could go overseas and have my english class you know get on 

184.77 190.07 A: a chat room with the students in america so you know they're actually talking with native speakers 

189.84 192.12 B: (( could speak english to )) 

190.60 191.64 A: and 

191.66 198.41 A: yeah and then i mean so one of the ways if you want to learn a language is to actually [noise] talk to people who 

198.70 200.11 A: use the language 

199.97 202.52 B: (( them some too so it's kinda like they )) 

200.65 201.63 A: and 

202.33 208.83 A: yeah yeah and that's great for for them and then it's great for the american students you know just to get a little more of a cultural 

209.66 211.02 A: understanding of 

209.81 214.08 B: (( used to do the pen pals but the computers would be a )) 

214.49 217.60 B: (( lot more um efficient i think [laughter] effective i know [laughter] like )) 

215.73 217.00 A: exactly 

217.66 224.62 B: (( i've been i've been to china and i love teaching in china and china's a l- it's not i won't call it a poor country but it's a )) 

217.96 219.37 A: exactly 

219.79 220.75 A: the 

221.62 223.07 A: yeah yeah 

224.68 226.04 B: (( developing country )) 

224.71 230.08 A: yeah it's more it's more efficient it's a little more 'cause you can get it's more of a conversation instead of just a 

230.11 231.09 A: um 

231.44 243.76 A: just you know the writing and then you've got to wait for for so long um and the the there is some big disadvantages though one is i plan to teach in more poor countries 

247.73 251.06 A: (( mhm )) 

251.16 252.24 B: mhm 

251.40 252.73 A: but um 

253.14 262.93 A: if i go to a place like um you know india or the philippines or um you know there's even an opportunity for me to work in an orphanage in morocco 

262.99 268.77 A: ah using computers will just be out of the question because you know they don't have the money or the resources 

267.89 269.54 B: that's true yeah 

268.93 274.38 A: or and you know that's something that i i because i want to work overseas i've tried to put everything into 

274.67 280.68 A: perspective and teaching computer skills is one thing but then trying to use it so much um 

282.15 285.96 B: you'd have to know another you couldn't just have everything based on ah mhm 

285.76 289.86 A: well yeah yeah it'd have to have i have the problem is just the access 

289.86 302.83 A: you know there's almost in in a number of places in the internet's i mean getting pretty widespread but i mean as far as you know if you it's kind of a different story like when i taught at in china you know you think of 

302.71 313.11 A: the schools in america and that's just what we know but then you know like living over there and our school was a cement block you know and the win- there were no windows it just like cement holes in the wall you know and so 

312.09 313.19 B: oh wow 

312.95 325.28 A: go over there and then there was internet access there were like a lot of internet cafes are pretty popular over there but then to be able to have you know if you're teaching a class with sixty kids you know they're not going to to have the university's not gonna have 

318.32 319.47 B: mhm 

325.57 330.78 A: a sixty computer computer lab that just you know that you just don't have that 

330.44 338.86 B: well even if they had there'd probably be a competition among all the different students trying to get in to to use it so you couldn't count on it 

333.74 335.15 A: exactly 

336.25 337.47 A: exactly 

338.55 339.68 A: right 

339.09 341.80 B: using it too heavily in the curriculum 

341.56 348.29 A: yeah so there there's there's a lot of really good advantages there's a lot of disadvantages that are just 

348.32 351.73 B: i have a five year old who's about to start kindergarten and um 

351.16 351.92 A: (( uh-huh )) 

352.00 360.84 B: he is very of course he'll be going to school here so we gotta do the computer thing very heavily but my husband's a programmer which is another 

358.14 359.00 A: right 

360.94 362.27 A: oh okay 

361.36 371.09 B: he's exposed to the computers at home constantly [laughter] so that we've got like four in the house the lap- two laptops and two desktops and 

365.64 366.69 A: right 

371.14 378.78 B: so he's just inundated with computers constantly but when i i did teacher training ten years ago 

374.67 375.82 A: yeah 

378.58 389.91 B: or twelve years ago i think and that was very different than there wasn't um they had like the one computer lab in the school they didn't even have them in the classrooms at that time 

380.60 381.40 A: (( okay )) 

389.66 390.75 A: right 

390.19 397.62 B: and i didn't i don't think i even took a computer class at all in my training so 

397.41 404.75 A: yeah i ah when i went to undergrad i just i just graduated last year from undergrad this is my first year of grad school and i had ah 

405.53 417.25 A: i had a class on computer applications like how to use word and micro- and excel and those things and how to get around but i mean i n- outside of that i never had it in class like i never used it 

411.24 412.28 B: mhm 

417.33 420.57 A: in a class i'd type things up but i mean besides that i never used it 

419.96 424.56 B: oh i see what you mean it wasn't part of the they weren't teaching you on the computer 

421.15 422.27 A: yeah 

424.30 425.87 A: right right and like 

426.42 427.95 A: something they're doing 

428.08 433.48 A: well like with the especially in younger kids like with your your son you said 

433.65 434.43 B: uh-huh 

434.28 443.99 A: who's just going into kindergarten like they have educational software so you know it's not like they're gonna teach them how to use word and stuff and how to use a computer but they'll use a computer you know with um [mn] 

435.82 436.60 B: yes 

444.43 448.46 A: i don't know to teach them sounds and teach them colors and but 

446.65 455.96 B: oh yeah we've got that he's already on that now so he does a couple of different they have them with everybody all the popular characters so they're interested that way and then 

449.04 450.46 A: yeah yeah 

451.07 451.99 A: yeah 

456.22 459.98 B: they've got the educational stuff in there 

458.31 459.54 A: right and 

459.87 469.15 A: yeah and like ah elementary and high school especially i mean you're gonna get those those kind of they're it's gonna be the computer more for educational purposes and then 

469.18 474.82 A: i ha- i don't know too many people in the universities that ah use computers 

474.96 478.43 A: besides this teaching application that as far as i know 

478.10 482.63 B: well i worked um in financial aid when i was in college and um 

481.52 482.40 A: uh-huh 

483.28 487.83 B: we didn't require it at the school i was at but there were other schools in 

488.01 488.79 B: (( i live )) 

488.88 494.99 B: in there were other schools in that required the students to have a laptop that was part of their um 

495.00 508.43 B: their fees part of their budget so they were smaller schools the school i worked at had like twenty five thousand students so didn't get into that but the smaller schools that was like their little their niche that ah everybody would have a laptop and they would be doing the and this has been 

495.07 496.50 A: (( oh okay )) 

500.42 501.38 A: okay 

508.41 510.69 B: oh heavens it's been six years so 

508.74 509.51 A: (( yes )) 

510.90 514.33 B: they were just starting to do that to um [noise] 

513.80 517.49 A: yeah it's become really popular now i go to a large school school too so we don't 

517.65 518.85 A: have that 

519.55 524.25 B: yeah we had the we had one computer lab [laughter] with not that many computers [laughter] so 

519.80 520.81 A: (( but )) 

523.77 524.81 A: okay 

524.61 526.15 B: i guess they figured you would 

527.11 530.85 B: find a computer somewhere else to type your papers on or something but [mn] 

530.28 536.60 A: yeah yeah well i'm in a large university and we have a lot of computer labs too but then you know you think about it i guess 

536.81 547.28 A: i'm thinking when you go down into elementary school and stuff not even elementary school but even high school i mean how many high schools have like enough computer labs with access for all the students to 

547.34 550.09 A: be able to use at the moment it's not 

550.30 555.70 A: widespread enough that i know that at least in especially in poorer communities and poorer schools 

555.96 562.23 A: i mean that's one thing to consider you know the just having access to that stuff for the students that's gonna take a lot of money you know to 

562.22 567.27 B: even um we live in a good school district but even in the classrooms they have like a few 

562.44 563.87 A: open up all these 

567.49 572.58 B: computers which i think is nice they have them in each classroom 'cause when i was student teaching it was 

567.97 568.88 A: right 

572.62 585.28 B: one computer lab and they would have the classes you know going in and out um and they'd have like the computer you know teacher person and the i did elementary so it'd be that the kids would be doing keyboarding and stuff like that 

576.03 577.38 A: oh 

584.70 585.53 A: (( okay okay )) 

585.24 588.70 B: um but they didn't have any in the classrooms at that time 

588.79 593.93 B: it's always a my husband was excited to hear they had them in the classrooms 

588.87 589.75 A: okay 

593.30 594.30 A: yeah 

594.35 596.87 B: i'll be interested to see what they um 

597.34 599.50 B: see what they do with it 

598.86 599.90 A: (( yeah y- ))
