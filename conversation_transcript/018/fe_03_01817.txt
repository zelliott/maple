1.04 2.41 B: hi my name 

1.37 2.55 A: hello 

2.44 5.82 B: hello my name is deena i'm calling from florida 

6.39 9.06 A: hi deena i'm lesley and i'm in indiana 

8.77 10.26 B: hi how are you 

10.25 12.88 A: oh pretty good it's a nice sunny day here 

12.72 15.02 B: same here [laughter] 

13.29 21.01 A: [laughter] i i bet it is [laughter] [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter] uh 

15.63 18.33 B: [laughter] it's always sunny here [mn] 

19.83 23.66 B: okay so what do you think of computers and education [laughter] 

23.73 26.52 A: um well uh 

27.17 37.09 A: i would say that i would think they can definitely be a good thing i think they can overdo it i really wouldn't want my kids you know sitting in front of the computer 

37.96 50.62 A: for hours and hours and hours at a time but i guess if they're going to [laughter] it depends on what the kids are going to do anyway if they are going to be doing something else if they're doing something educational in front of the computer that's probably better than not 

51.51 62.07 B: well my i have i have two kids and my seven year old has computer lab at school but that's purely educational 

62.14 71.11 B: um they for reading a story or doing a maths game and at home they have ga- they have games but they don't have any 

71.31 81.29 B: they don't have anything violent everything basically is educational in in one form or another i i mean i think it's hysterical that my seven year old calls it 

81.25 92.10 B: keyboarding he doesn't even call it he doesn't even call it typing i mean i barely made it out of high school typing and he's got computer lab in first grade 

82.70 84.86 A: [laughter] 

88.58 90.75 A: (( [laughter] )) 

92.04 93.74 A: oh boy wow 

92.35 96.03 B: so it's it's a it's a sign 

96.15 104.02 B: it's a sign of the times i mean i just hope it doesn't like you have liquid crystal display clocks that replaced real clocks 

104.18 111.53 B: so you can't learn how to tell time i i don't think that compu- i don't think computers can replace teachers but 

107.37 108.50 A: oh that's true 

108.52 109.14 A: (( hm )) 

111.55 122.56 B: there's there's nothing like seeing your child being able to concentrate for that long on a goal oriented task so i i think there's a place for them in education 

122.96 130.67 A: yeah um i i actually i home school so education would be up my alley [laughter] but um 

128.63 129.63 B: ahah 

130.89 142.56 A: um my main complaint with a lot of the uh computer now i'm sure like when they're doing computer labs at school they probably have very specific things they do but a lot of the educational um 

139.85 140.72 B: yes 

142.46 146.38 A: games my only complaint with them is that they're very slow 

146.46 150.22 A: so out of their time they spend doing it they don't 

150.58 158.95 A: get as much as they could just because it's so slow i did find there's a um a really good maths game called quarter mile maths 

159.34 160.35 A: um 

160.32 175.06 A: and it's uh the whole point of it is to be quick it's like a race i- it makes your horse or a car if you choose kind of race by how quick you answer the maths problems and it's really good um so that i would definitely recommend to anybody 

175.15 184.19 A: um especially if they want to you know kind of review their maths and have fun and that type of thing uh [mn] we even play it the adults a little bit so 

184.79 186.73 A: um the only thing 

187.18 188.16 A: go ahead 

187.80 189.38 B: no no go ahead 

189.28 190.31 A: um 

190.37 195.27 A: i know like with home schooling there are some uh on line programs you can do 

195.90 209.66 A: and i'm sure i i just i hesitate a little because i'm not sure how much time they'll spend sitting in front of the computer but a problem with us too with home schooling is um i do a lot of work on the computer 

210.09 217.66 A: so [mn] we need to get a second one for them to do anything otherwise i'm hogging it more than they could even get a chance to do as much because 

216.42 217.21 B: um 

217.51 219.88 B: how many kids do you home school 

219.87 220.80 A: (( uh )) 

220.83 229.48 A: well i have three but one she's just turning two in a week or two so she doesn't count a whole lot yet [laughter] [laughter] but you said you have the one 

225.99 227.07 B: right 

229.06 234.46 B: i have i have a four year old son and i have a seven year old son 

229.59 230.73 A: just the one 

234.91 245.17 B: but my four year old's been at the computer since before he's two and he he he knows how to do america on line 

239.77 240.95 A: oh boy 

244.87 249.47 A: oh boy [laughter] 

245.60 248.41 B: he i mean he knows he knows 

248.48 256.08 B: he knows how to do everything the only thing is when they're done with the computer they insist on taking the c._d. out 

254.83 257.30 A: [noise] yeah 

256.08 265.61 B: and they're always getting their fingerprints on i think that's my biggest complaint about computers and education is that they haven't devised a way to lock the hard drive 

265.88 267.28 A: oh yeah 

266.42 270.57 B: so that once you put the c._d. in the child can't take it out 

270.61 277.15 B: until you're ready because i've had my computer broken and i've had c._d.s ruined 

276.66 285.42 A: yeah i've had them uh where the two year old got a hold of them got it out and cracked it [laughter] yeah that wasn't too pleasant [laughter] 

282.08 283.60 B: hold on one sec 

284.50 285.65 B: what sam 

286.58 290.17 B: what's what noise the kids are out in the back yard swimming 

292.65 295.50 B: and i'm on the phone can you wait a minute 

295.45 296.65 A: [laughter] 

297.88 303.02 B: you want to play a computer game ha ha isn't that funny what do you want to play 

303.23 305.68 A: [laughter] good timing 

304.07 305.37 B: go go pick 

305.40 307.64 B: is that is that funny 

307.39 311.26 A: yeah [laughter] probably heard you talking about it 

309.08 321.70 B: the construction one it's in it's in the kids' office that we call the play room the kids' office now isn't that funny when they record this mum can i play a computer game [noise] but he's going to do road construction which is 

314.37 315.52 A: [laughter] 

321.94 331.13 B: really cool because it teaches them all about construction and then it allows him to print out pictures that he can color in 

331.15 337.90 B: and it also has little movies inside that show what it does i mean [mn] 

338.44 341.48 B: there's nothing that we have that's that's [mn] 

342.24 356.47 B: that's [mn] geared towards any violence or anything i mean thank god he doesn't know from like game boy or play station or anything i mean they don't know what that stuff is and that's just fine with me 

346.01 347.01 A: right 

351.29 353.08 A: [laughter] 

356.40 363.01 A: [laughter] i don't blame you yeah we found we had gotten a play station as a gift but we uh 

358.13 359.35 B: i mean i'm 

363.35 365.66 A: definitely limit it to the 

365.18 365.76 B: (( [noise] )) 

367.02 371.11 A: non violent kind of things you know [laughter] [laughter] 

368.90 383.03 B: right i mean it's bad it's bad enough some of the stuff he watches on t._v. and i think that he's watching something that's good and then something comes out of his mouth and i say where did you hear that and he i'm more concerned about 

383.11 384.32 B: um 

384.52 387.57 B: t._v. than i am about uh 

388.37 401.89 B: than i am about computers because computers at least i can take a look at the content and control it [noise] t._v. is a completely different thing but i have to tell you off topic i mean i know we're supposed to be talking about this 

402.30 408.14 B: god bless you for home schooling i could last probably a week and then 

407.10 409.72 A: (( [laughter] )) 

408.92 416.58 B: and then like i consider my my kid going to school like his job that's his office he gets up in the morning 

415.43 417.62 A: [laughter] 

416.48 426.07 B: he he takes his briefcase he goes to work because [mn] if i go into school and volunteer something i like upset his whole day so 

424.98 427.10 A: [laughter] 

426.11 434.79 B: that's that's his job the little one i i i'm there every day doing something because i'm very involved in the p._t._a. but 

434.85 443.96 B: if if i had both of them at home i think i don't know what would happen i think they would either lock me in a closet [laughter] or or something 

442.81 448.35 A: well some days you do feel like that that's for sure [laughter] 

445.57 456.33 B: my neighbor my neighbor's home schooling her kids this year and uh i don't think she's quite got the hang of it because she's got a really loosey goosey schedule 

456.11 457.64 A: [laughter] 

456.42 468.21 B: and this is accord- this is according to the kids and it's fine with me but one of her kids was held back in public school because she she was really having some learning difficulties 

468.08 475.23 B: and the other two are doing great because they're just they're smart bright kids but but the little one 

475.38 483.05 B: you know she really needs a lot of structure i mean if you are going to home school you've got to be prepared to 

483.11 487.92 B: you know not say oh let's sleep in or i have to do this or that and 

488.21 490.28 B: the two older ones have 

490.33 495.34 B: i mean they're older they're like in fifth grade and eight grade but the third grader 

495.80 502.36 B: i i [mn] you know they i in florida at the end of the year they have to take some standardized test 

502.33 503.17 A: (( ahah )) 

502.65 506.44 B: to see where you know where they are in terms of the standards 

506.58 513.69 B: and the older kids are doing great with home schooling but the younger one who had problems to begin with 

513.98 522.03 B: uh she's not doing so great [laughter] and mum's mum's going to take some extra teaching lessons i think 

516.64 518.73 A: [laughter] mm 

522.44 524.37 A: yeah well yeah 

524.40 525.81 A: hard to uh 

527.64 529.16 A: hard to keep them 

529.85 533.56 A: r- regulated there especially if their 

533.71 548.11 A: not really their thing they don't really like educational things which if you're having a hard time with it most people don't like things [laughter] so um 

541.86 546.77 B: what what was what was factored into your decision to home school your kids 

548.06 549.26 A: well 

550.04 553.80 A: religion would have one part of it um 

554.04 558.56 A: you know that's definitely important to us and obviously the schools are meant to be 

559.34 571.12 A: non-religious [laughter] so uh unless of course you send them to a a school but we just didn't have any we were satisfied around us here either so we didn't feel like that was much of an option but um 

560.83 561.85 B: mhm 

571.97 579.03 A: i i like educational things so it- it's not hard for me to incorporate them into my life 

578.83 583.66 B: i hope you don't think i'm a bad parent [laughter] 

581.01 592.86 A: oh no no no [laughter] no no ah no definitely not [laughter] i have friends who their kids go to public schools or go it private schools or go wherever i have one who she keeps rotating 

592.77 599.95 A: she sends them to public and then she gets fed up with stuff and then she sends them to a private and then they moved so they couldn't there any more so then she home
