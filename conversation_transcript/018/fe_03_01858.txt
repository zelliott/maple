381.67 384.52 B: [mn] no i think that's important yeah 

383.59 394.94 A: but you know what i'm saying they'll use my computer which is by my desk we have three computers in every class but they will use my computers as opposed to going to that separate room and it's it's terrific you know what i'm saying we just pull up things all the time

499.41 503.04 A: i have no idea but this one seems really really interesting whereby 

502.87 517.74 A: it that's what i'm saying it's it's an educational kind of thing it's something that i can relate to like you know talking about computers and things like that how it relates to my job on a daily basis you know i'm interested in things that you know i mean i do some other you know market survey kind of things but they're not 

509.38 510.44 B: mhm

523.88 524.90 B: yeah 

526.71 527.63 B: well that's 

526.90 527.91 A: but um
