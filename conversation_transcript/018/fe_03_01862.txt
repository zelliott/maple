122.33 125.16 B: really small kid type things

127.59 128.66 A: oh 

131.08 131.92 A: uh-huh 

131.60 133.42 B: i could leave her there to 

133.48 137.32 B: click around you know go off and do something else and she could handle it 

134.73 135.69 A: uh-huh 

137.60 138.75 A: oh 

138.04 140.94 B: and she was like really quick at that 

140.99 142.30 A: oh i see

144.88 145.66 A: uh-huh 

147.03 149.05 A: oh she's already doing that too 

148.71 150.46 B: yeah yeah 

149.77 153.93 A: oh yeah i think i i'm for computers too 

153.48 154.30 B: mhm 

154.11 156.51 A: and i have a two and a half year old 

156.12 157.55 B: mhm 

156.88 158.92 A: and she already likes um 

159.15 161.67 A: she wants to see what we're doing 

161.40 162.76 B: that's right yep 

162.07 163.75 A: when we're on the computer 

163.34 164.85 B: mhm 

164.10 169.47 A: and then she asks us ah you know what letter the keyboard on the keyboard 

169.03 170.59 B: right 

169.57 181.81 A: she says what you know what is it what is it what is it and then we repeat to her it's j. or it's w. like a hundred times you know [laughter] she asks what is that yeah they keep on asking 

172.14 173.01 B: [laughter] 

177.18 179.96 B: that's right [laughter] they keep asking 

181.65 184.60 A: and then she'll be tapping on it many times 

183.85 185.06 B: mhm 

184.79 191.75 A: and then she'll be tapping on s. and she'll say s. s s. s s. s s. you know and she thinks it's a game 

188.51 190.13 B: mhm yep 

191.81 193.86 A: i mean she thinks it's a play 

193.38 194.91 B: yeah that's right 

194.59 195.49 A: yeah 

195.09 204.52 B: and i think that that's one thing that that's why it's good for them because in a way it's ah because of that play feeling i mean kids learn by play 

195.67 196.68 A: yeah 

204.18 205.28 A: mhm 

204.56 208.84 B: and so when it's when it's a game an educational type game 

208.57 209.59 A: mhm 

208.95 214.63 B: then ah they learn they learn 'cause kids are like a sponge you know they soak it up 

211.72 212.83 A: (( yeah )) 

214.29 215.80 A: yeah 

215.08 217.15 B: and so i know there was um 

217.30 224.32 B: a lady i was talking to that she was saying oh it you know it doesn't it detracts 'cause it's very only one sided 

224.29 236.89 B: ah but you know when it when they're interactive i don't see how they're one sided if they have to respond and according to how they respond like for example the math the math one that she had was really good they were they were all games 

229.57 230.52 A: uh-huh 

232.99 233.87 A: yeah 

236.50 237.54 A: uh-huh 

237.03 239.07 B: like there was one that was the 

239.42 241.41 B: rabbit was on a tightrope 

241.06 241.95 A: uh-huh 

241.49 244.89 B: and there was a bucket of water underneath 

242.77 244.46 A: oh 

245.05 255.00 B: and there was a hippo and ah she had to for example at the beginning she had to it was either you start with simple numbers like one two or three 

246.87 247.80 A: uh-huh 

254.61 255.51 A: uh-huh 

255.03 256.53 B: and 

256.79 259.16 B: ah the rabbit would be holding up 

259.97 264.95 B: a certain amount of blocks and if it if it was the four blocks 

263.25 264.60 A: oh yeah 

265.08 273.38 B: she was supposed to click on the water so that the rabbit would dump it down because that wasn't the number let's say it was three but if it was three you'd click on 

266.89 267.81 A: uh-huh 

271.38 272.07 A: uh-huh 

273.49 279.10 B: ah the hippo and then the hippo would do like a balancing act holding the three blocks 

278.98 282.07 A: oh yeah i've seen that rabbit thing 

279.79 281.09 B: and so 

281.71 283.67 B: (( yeah so it ah )) 

282.65 284.41 A: somebody had it uh-huh 

284.05 287.42 B: it was really good and then there was another one that was 

287.69 289.29 B: um 

289.77 290.89 B: (( like a i )) 

291.08 292.54 B: think it was the seal 

292.72 293.58 A: uh-huh 

293.08 295.05 B: a seal that's like juggling 

294.73 295.67 A: uh-huh 

295.33 309.94 B: and it's like adding and subtracting and so it goes up if you do the first one it gives you multiple choice you get to pick one plus one it will give you a choice one two three four if you get it right it will go one plus two 

297.83 299.09 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

303.53 304.45 A: uh-huh 

305.68 306.58 A: uh-huh 

306.94 307.82 A: uh-huh 

309.82 312.57 B: and then if you get it right it will go one plus three 

312.74 318.61 B: and ah if you get it wrong it will start over again one plus one so it's like repetition 

317.46 319.01 A: oh uh-huh 

318.90 324.32 B: until they get it all right and they get a every time they get something right they get a coupon 

322.63 323.47 A: uh-huh 

324.43 325.57 A: oh uh-huh 

324.86 329.31 B: and then they go get go to cash in it's like you set up like a circus 

328.98 329.86 A: uh-huh 

329.46 332.58 B: and so each thing is like a circus one 

332.59 337.15 B: and they go cash in their coupons to get some little figure from 

337.30 345.89 B: the store supposedly you know like some would be worth three some would be worth six and some nine so in a way too it gets them into 

338.97 339.88 A: uh-huh 

342.02 342.96 A: uh-huh 

346.03 353.20 B: ah how much they need to to buy or to to cash it in and so it gets them thinking in that way too even 

350.51 351.48 A: uh-huh 

353.99 358.80 B: so i really am for the computers because i think it really helped them 

354.04 355.37 A: (( oh my god )) 

358.72 361.72 A: yeah i think when they enjoy 

362.19 363.82 A: the program 

363.45 364.50 B: mhm 

364.10 366.19 A: they'll really improve 

365.90 366.92 B: yes 

366.86 368.53 A: and if it's too 

368.61 372.64 A: um boring or complicated or it's a little 

373.01 378.36 A: um too easy or too difficult maybe they'll lose it um they'll lose attention 

374.41 375.33 B: mhm 

377.87 388.60 B: that's right and then it's not not worth you know like i personally am not for for example the the video type games where all they're doing is they're 

378.82 379.66 A: so 

379.84 380.93 A: it's not 

381.30 382.05 A: (( [noise] )) 

386.36 387.67 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

388.68 390.78 B: clicking and clicking trying to 

391.14 402.12 B: to shoot down the car the whatever i i don't i'm not for those 'cause i don't see those they're they're addictive but they don't have any value to my thinking 

393.52 395.41 A: yeah uh-huh mhm 

401.45 403.48 A: yeah yeah 

402.37 407.67 B: whereas the other educational type programs i think those are great you know [mn] 

404.85 405.81 A: uh-huh 

407.02 408.14 A: yeah 

408.48 412.54 A: yeah i heard that um the video game of ah role play 

412.47 413.38 B: yeah 

412.76 423.06 A: or building cities those kind of video games are ah a little bit um you have you really have to use your brain and you really have to do a lot of thinking 

414.41 415.30 B: mhm 

419.77 421.15 B: mhm mhm 

422.79 423.94 B: right 

423.40 425.40 A: (( then those are a little bit )) 

425.84 427.66 A: different i think 

426.63 429.34 B: yeah mhm better type 

428.63 434.09 A: yeah yeah yeah i've been thinking about getting a computer program for my daughter 

433.53 435.10 B: yeah mhm 

434.31 437.35 A: yeah she's she's gonna be two and a half so 

436.50 437.93 B: right right 

437.60 439.82 A: and she can talk yeah 

438.23 443.61 B: well if you you get it um and you sit down with her and you know they catch it up so quick 

443.36 444.47 A: uh-huh 

443.90 448.98 B: the first the first thing they they have to learn like i put the the mouse on its slowest 

449.11 455.88 B: um you know how you can get it so it moves fast or slower on the screen and so i put it on the slowest 'cause one thing that 

452.26 453.44 A: oh 

454.69 455.58 A: uh-huh 

456.09 463.05 B: to begin with is the hand eye coordination you know the knowing that when you move your hand that moves the mouse 

459.10 460.83 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

461.81 462.65 A: uh-huh 

463.10 469.09 B: so the first part is when they catch on about that and then they have to like for example my um 

463.10 464.11 A: yeah 

470.00 481.82 B: my five she just turned five two days ago but she still has a little bit of problem getting it you know she has takes a little while while she gets it centered exactly where she wants it before she clicks 

472.69 474.37 A: (( mhm oh )) 

474.55 475.27 A: uh-huh 

480.79 481.69 A: uh-huh 

482.27 486.08 B: and so it takes a while for that hand eye coordination 

482.34 483.73 A: oh yeah 

485.84 488.33 A: yeah that mouse is pretty difficult 

487.73 489.42 B: yeah yeah 

488.69 492.06 A: 'cause it's kinda huge but the the little arrow 

492.24 502.80 B: yeah that's right you know they they have to think in their mind that actually what their hand is doing is moving that little mouse to begin with it's kind of hard for them to get that 

492.40 494.59 A: is all over the place yeah 

499.19 500.55 A: uh-huh 

500.73 501.85 A: yeah 

502.38 505.75 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah 

505.80 509.24 A: yeah i'm thinking where do you usually um buy 

509.30 511.41 A: go buy your softwares 

511.69 515.02 B: ah well future shop 

515.12 516.06 A: uh-huh 

515.43 517.44 B: or a and b. sound 

517.59 518.83 A: oh 

517.85 522.11 B: or places that you know even even places like 

522.39 529.01 B: walmart or i just look around to see where yeah yeah i just look around to see where you know 

523.96 527.71 A: oh the just the anywhere yeah i've seen it at 

529.22 532.31 B: they have them and and certain ones 

532.15 533.16 A: uh-huh 

532.72 538.99 B: like ah right now that they're older my my dad bought my older daughter the magic school bus 

539.14 541.08 A: oh yeah 

539.31 544.27 B: ones where they talk about ah she's got the ones that was um 

544.45 547.59 B: about the wild about the animals animal kingdom 

546.50 547.50 A: uh-huh 

547.78 548.94 B: and so 

547.81 549.91 A: oh yeah yeah 

549.37 554.48 B: so that was kinda nice 'cause it has games but besides that they learn things 

554.20 555.17 A: uh-huh 

554.79 558.16 B: and she thought that was great she really enjoyed that one 

558.08 563.08 A: oh and how long does she um is she on the com- computer 

563.11 566.91 B: ah she doesn't actually she used to she went through phases 

563.92 565.00 A: usually 

566.92 576.44 B: um when she was younger she wanted to be she was on it a bit every day she liked playing those games but now that she goes to school 

569.92 570.83 A: uh-huh 

576.38 577.28 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

576.74 578.02 B: she's kind of 

578.24 578.82 A: (( uh-huh )) 

578.33 584.02 B: more into to playing with her friends and you know so she doesn't do it as much only once in a while 

579.30 580.42 A: [noise] 

583.64 584.68 A: oh 

584.19 590.25 B: so in a way you know like some people say oh it's addictive and everything but you know she played a lot more when she was 

590.79 599.95 B: when she was ah alone or when she was younger but now that she's in school she she's not as interested to only do it once in a while because she 

593.88 594.82 A: uh-huh 

597.44 598.58 A: oh
