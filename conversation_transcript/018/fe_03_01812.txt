0.75 2.55 A: hi i'm dietta 

2.27 4.02 B: hi i'm amy 

3.76 5.16 A: hi amy 

5.01 6.20 B: how are you 

5.95 7.40 A: just fine 

7.36 8.35 B: good 

7.50 14.01 A: are are you uh familiar with ed- education computers and education [laughter] 

13.58 22.15 B: um well i did all my uh research papers on computers and stuff did a lot of research uh on computers i think computers are good [sigh] 

18.04 19.37 A: (( oh )) 

22.29 23.90 A: okay in 

23.30 24.55 B: personally 

24.31 27.10 A: in the education uh system 

26.90 36.43 B: [sigh] well i've only you know i'm i'm thirty so i only use computers in hi- in college pretty much you know i'm too [mn] i'm not young enough to have used them elsewhere how about you 

31.78 33.61 A: (( mhm )) 

36.27 41.68 A: [noise] no way past that in fact we didn't even have them when i went to college [laughter] 

37.60 38.78 B: yeah [laughter] 

39.88 45.95 B: exa- yeah i mean i know like my son who is a year and a half he already is interested in the computer 

45.36 59.08 A: yes yeah i think i i really believe that computers can be a real asset but i think we have to be careful not to let them replace um the one on one contact and the interaction 

47.52 48.43 B: amazing 

56.09 57.08 B: people 

57.24 60.00 B: oh i agree i do agree with you there 

59.67 67.01 A: because i think that's where part of our whole social issues are coming from is that we're not 

67.09 69.13 A: we're not used to 

69.94 72.54 A: having our kids interact with people 

72.61 80.89 B: oh i agree too it's like you know people spend too much time either playing video games or watching t._v. or staring at too many little boxes you know 

77.52 78.32 A: (( right )) 

80.41 81.62 A: yeah 

80.97 82.06 B: [laughter] 

81.76 83.21 A: well and then 

83.60 86.97 A: they don't learn just even regular social graces 

86.35 95.52 B: exactly you do have to learn how to get along with other people that's uh that's as important as learning how to program your computer or or research things on line or whatever 

89.25 90.85 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

95.52 99.92 A: yeah well and those are pretty easy to learn really [laughter] 

98.32 101.25 B: exactly those are good things to learn but they're not the 

100.78 102.05 A: right 

101.35 103.80 B: be all and end all of the [laughter] 

103.44 108.67 A: and i know on uh some of the chat rooms and different things forums 

108.58 119.90 A: that you go to i mean people they don't even know how to spell they don't know how to phrase things so that it's not offensive and those are basics that you can learn 

118.90 123.20 B: i agree it's kind of scary when you read things that people write and you're like [mn] can't you 

123.24 126.11 B: (( can't you spell a simple word [laughter] )) 

123.47 124.52 A: wow 

124.91 134.74 A: well i have read notices that i didn't even understand what they were trying to say [laughter] you know the way it was phrased but i i have 

130.62 131.55 B: yeah 

132.54 133.83 B: i know what you mean 

134.57 144.38 A: i used to be on a local school board so we had a lot of issues about around computers and i think 

138.87 139.86 B: oh wow 

144.80 155.79 A: we our school district was not real good at integrating the computer or the access to the computers in all of the different classes um i think 

155.82 168.02 A: we make a big mistake by saying okay you're going to have you know an hour an hour and a half of computers but you need to help that student integrate those into the other classes 

162.02 162.83 B: (( ahah )) 

168.13 172.73 A: and our school district wasn't able to do that we didn't couldn't afford it 

172.77 179.81 B: yeah there's a lot of money you know issues i know my son is not in school yet so i haven't had to deal with that i've only 

174.79 175.76 A: mhm 

180.09 183.09 A: you'll learn [laughter] 

180.21 184.66 B: god i don't even want to think about it i haven't had to even think about it yet but 

183.66 189.04 A: yeah well what we found was that a lot of the issues was that the teacher it's 

185.06 185.76 B: (( i don't )) 

188.99 193.12 A: you know the older teachers especially and some of the younger ones 

193.01 205.12 A: were not familiar enough and were not trained in their education to become teachers to utilize the computer within their curriculum that they set up 

204.52 210.79 B: yeah that's hard if you know because kids a lot of times know more than you when you're older and about computers you know 

207.87 209.59 A: mhm mhm 

210.15 222.53 A: well they they have access to too much information and i think one of the things we need to teach our kids is is that everything that's on on the internet is not fact [laughter] and 

221.02 225.47 B: no i know actually so much of it isn't so much is just 

224.61 228.36 A: right and they have to be very careful because i know we 

228.50 230.78 A: have kids that will 

231.11 237.43 A: you know show up with a report that they have taken from a bogus site that had a diff- you know a whole 

237.87 240.82 A: not a reality base [laughter] 

240.71 244.95 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah that's that's definitely not good i think you definitely have to 

243.14 244.20 A: no 

245.01 249.90 B: balance them like actually going to the library too and looking at actual physical books 

249.51 253.62 A: oh i know i know but [mn] it 

252.68 255.63 B: but then there's stuff that you can only find on the com- you know 

255.66 259.07 B: especially like i went to school in montana so it was definitely 

259.16 261.98 B: nice because we didn't have the world's best library 

261.81 266.69 A: yes well where i live right now we don't even have a library system 

266.75 267.75 B: oh wow 

267.49 269.01 A: mhm 

268.30 269.91 B: yes i didn't you know 

269.67 274.15 A: that yeah that's the internet's my access to any information 

270.86 272.11 B: that makes it hard 

274.59 289.06 A: um and we only get um um weekend delivery paper delivery because i live way out in the country and they just don't so you you know if i didn't have the t._v. and the internet i would have no access to current information 

274.84 275.79 B: sure 

281.54 282.44 B: (( ahah )) 

287.68 288.44 B: [laughter] 

288.96 291.20 B: like what's going on [laughter] 

290.08 292.44 A: [laughter] yeah i mean really 

291.90 292.93 B: totally 

293.09 296.45 A: so well the other advantage is that i 

296.80 309.86 A: mean the computer system is expensive and to keep it upgraded and all of that but i [mn] also the encyclopedias that we used sets we used to have to buy [mn] 

310.29 313.59 B: oh god they were so obsolete like in five minutes too 

310.30 312.21 A: were expensive [noise] 

313.00 315.00 A: yeah and y- 

314.36 316.51 B: and don't they cost like one million dollars 

316.11 319.19 A: well they were very expensive at the time 

318.91 319.92 B: yeah 

319.32 324.42 A: you know and and compared i haven't even i imagine there are i 

324.67 329.01 A: i don't even know if they sell them any more except to schools or institutions 

328.72 331.03 B: yeah i think just to libraries and things 

330.80 334.33 A: yeah because i certainly wouldn't invest in one 

334.38 337.82 A: a a set of encyclopedias because we've got 

336.50 343.12 B: no because they're just not you know as soon as they print them they're wrong [sigh] stuff is changing so much 

340.76 342.39 A: well they were yeah 

342.88 355.49 A: right they were out the date before we got them [laughter] so but i think in education we have to be real careful in in supplying not just computer literacy 

355.22 363.53 B: yeah i think that it's good to take advantage of the things computers can do for you but not to think that you know it replaces other things 

363.29 364.41 A: right 

364.60 367.76 A: especially social graces of some sort 

367.36 369.02 B: yeah people definitely 

368.05 374.07 A: that's what i that's what i see in a lot of the teenagers they just do not know how to handle a 

373.03 373.84 B: (( [sigh] )) 

374.09 386.17 A: an irate situation you know or a confron- confrontation of any kind other than just the computer game response of bapping [laughter] you know 

384.81 390.18 B: yeah give you a smack it's like no that's not the best way to handle things actually 

386.94 388.49 A: yeah right 

390.03 396.38 A: yeah well it it makes it pretty difficult to deal with someone like that 

396.67 405.74 B: i know i told my i told my husband he plays some computers games that are a little bit violent i'm like you know if our son is in the room i really don't want you to play those games 

405.00 406.90 A: yeah right [laughter] 

405.77 409.73 B: [laughter] you know that's really not the best uh thing for him to be learning 

410.24 415.97 A: well it it just it makes it too easy it's just like anything else that even if you 

416.15 417.05 A: you know 

417.10 421.45 A: focus on something that that is um 

421.68 424.19 A: bad or or not 

424.68 436.37 A: with really the way you should be thinking then that's the way you are going to react in a situation because you've thought that through and it's ingrained in you and those computer games do that 

435.66 437.50 B: yeah exactly that's 

436.59 439.16 A: you know they just keep it there and 

438.24 442.32 B: there's definitely some better things to ingrain in people than [laughter] 

441.04 443.35 A: yeah [laughter] well 

442.59 445.42 B: oh let's just shoot everybody and all that kind of stuff 

444.90 458.68 A: and that's looks like what's happening a lot but but part of that i think goes back to the fact that we're not in our state anyway we don't fund our education the way we should you know we demand [noise] 

457.42 468.07 B: oh yeah actually where we live in washington we uh we had our school uh uh where i live in issaquah they had the school start like two weeks late because all the teachers were striking 

467.94 473.44 B: they're like the lowest paid teachers in the whole state and it's like one of the most expensive districts to live in [laughter] and 

472.80 474.62 A: [laughter] 

474.11 482.94 B: having teachers who are who can't afford to put their kids their kids are like on the free school lunch program because they can't afford to buy food for their own kids [mn] 

479.78 480.65 A: (( ahah )) 

483.09 485.53 A: so so you have a great um 

484.87 486.83 B: that's not right [laughter] you know 

486.00 492.70 A: [laughter] well but at least there's a process to provide them some food 

492.44 501.71 B: yeah well that it it's good they have that but it's just you know i mean they had teachers who were trying to strike and we actually had parents who were going and and marching against the teachers saying you know 

493.10 493.91 A: (( with yeah )) 

501.65 507.84 B: we're sorry about your raise and all but we don't want to have our kids home you're like inconveniencing you know we we work at microsoft 

506.43 512.91 A: oh yeah yeah well [laughter] i don't know the 

508.17 509.94 B: we have at work 

511.85 513.10 B: kind of scary 

513.64 514.72 A: (( the [mn] )) 

515.15 519.03 A: it's it's just not a good system [laughter] 

517.64 520.01 B: no they need to do something with it 

520.62 521.65 B: although 

520.67 526.72 A: well a part of it i think is is coming about and you live in washington state i take it i do 

525.11 529.94 B: yes so actually we probably have more computers than most people because bill gates you know that's what he does 

528.10 532.09 A: well i live in washington state too [laughter] 

530.85 535.15 B: yeah oh you're in washington it seems like ev- everybody i talk to talk to so far is in washington 

534.94 541.21 A: is that right well probably because we're so ingrained with computers and react to 

535.97 536.92 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

541.38 545.82 A: notices [laughter] yeah so 

542.42 544.34 B: yeah that's probably that's probably true 

545.83 546.72 A: but 

545.91 547.68 B: everyone here has a computer 

548.12 552.47 A: you know i i am amazed though that a lot of them do not 

552.92 553.74 B: hm 

553.04 554.75 A: how many people 

554.89 559.86 A: do not have one and are not interested in in in it at all 

560.71 562.42 A: even people that 

562.77 566.49 A: [mn] younger people you know that had them in school and that kind of stuff 

565.70 568.59 B: oh nearly everybody i know has a computer 

568.78 569.63 A: (( well )) 

568.84 571.30 B: like everyone [laughter] 

570.24 573.60 A: uh i know most people have them but they don't 

573.43 587.32 A: utilize them you know i sent an email to my niece that's over on the coast and she has computer systems and the whole bit but i she doesn't check her email but probably twice a month [laughter] yeah i know 

581.14 582.02 B: ah 

584.90 590.62 B: oh wow i tell half of my friends i don't even talk to them except by email like or in person you know 

589.01 590.43 A: (( i yeah )) 

590.95 592.10 A: (( [mn] right )) 

590.98 594.02 B: the telephone is kind of obsolete these days you know 

593.39 599.89 A: well and i was amazed that i even agreed to do this because i'm not a telephone talker i 

599.19 599.95 B: yeah
