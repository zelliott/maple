1.64 2.93 B: hello 

2.71 4.28 A: hi [laughter]

13.91 15.59 B: okay i can hear you better 

14.88 15.99 A: okay 

16.57 19.26 B: hi well i guess our topic is 

18.43 22.27 A: life partners what to look for in a life partner [noise] 

19.56 20.37 B: life 

21.59 24.27 B: yes [laughter] 

22.66 26.94 A: [noise] um well let's see [laughter] um 

27.18 35.33 A: i guess that can mean anything from somebody who a person is living with or a married person or 

36.17 38.97 B: yeah i consider my husband my life partner 

38.04 39.69 A: yeah same here 

39.57 45.22 B: yeah and i would have to say when i was on hold waiting i would have to say it's a balance 

45.46 52.90 B: like i'm serious and he's not [laughter] and he's funny and i'm not [laughter] 

48.11 49.24 A: mhm 

52.08 53.33 A: yeah 

52.98 59.10 B: and i um tend to get things done and he'll back me up 

59.16 66.09 B: and i have two kids and we have to have balance i think the word that keeps coming back to me is balance 

65.38 69.97 A: mhm yeah i agree with that i think our differences complement each other 

70.50 72.92 A: and our uh 

73.64 83.90 A: i don't know our shared interests also matter too because if we weren't interested in anything the same you know that wouldn't that wouldn't be uh very good either [laughter] 

83.81 86.40 B: (( now how long have your been married )) 

85.11 88.76 A: uh we've been married for almost nine years 

88.20 90.58 B: nine years because i've been married for fourteen 

90.09 91.89 A: oh fourteen mhm 

91.29 93.19 B: yeah and i find our our 

93.37 96.53 B: our interests are changing over time 

96.67 101.29 B: um but it doesn't seem to matter um 

101.56 104.23 B: we don't share nearly the same things we used to 

103.98 104.97 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

104.33 117.08 B: which is interesting we just had a talk about this but we're both independent enough people that it's okay whereas i had a friend who recently got divorced because they 

117.17 123.49 B: weren't doing the same thing and didn't share the same things but one of them was very she happened to be very needy 

123.72 128.82 B: and needed to be doing the same thing and be where he was and where he was going and um 

129.70 140.58 B: one of the things that attracted my husband and i to each other was our independence um and we still have that so we both kind of go our own ways and yet um 

133.69 134.75 A: mhm 

140.68 142.95 B: because what you said about shared interests 

142.39 143.38 A: mhm 

143.30 147.49 B: um so i don't know it's gonna be interesting to see our kids i have teenagers now 

147.62 152.60 B: as they get older what happens you must have a young one because i hear him in the back 

152.07 155.58 A: yeah i have a thirteen month old baby girl [noise] 

155.43 158.18 B: [laughter] yeah i have a twelve and a fourteen year old 

157.77 165.19 A: mhm well i also have a seventeen year old boy a fifteen year boy yes [laughter] a thirteen year old boy and an eight year old boy 

160.84 162.11 B: oh you do 

165.03 167.83 B: oh so you do so you know 

167.27 169.07 A: (( mhm )) 

168.33 173.49 B: yeah that's interesting and you've been married for nine years 

169.70 171.05 A: mhm 

172.04 174.84 A: yeah nine years this is my second marriage 

174.94 182.62 B: yeah so did you find that your interests or whatever i mean were you looking for another life partner or did it not matter 

182.43 193.81 A: um well i'll say one thing uh if this situation should not work out which i you know i don't feel that it won't but i don't think a person can never say never because 

193.18 195.61 B: [noise] isn't that the truth 

194.83 202.56 A: yeah well with my first marriage if someone had told me oh you'll be divorced in however many years i would have said you're crazy no way 

202.68 203.76 B: right 

202.85 209.27 A: but that's just the way it went and that's a very long and complicated story [laughter] but 

208.22 214.54 B: right but don't you think marriage is is i mean even to have uh you know one life partner i think it's work 

214.29 215.99 A: mhm it is mhm 

214.85 218.55 B: i mean i don't think these people that get divorced after 

218.61 221.50 B: s- somebody i know just got divorced after a year 

221.52 233.40 B: i don't think they really gave that i mean i don't think they really wanted to work at it now there's a lot of reasons that that there should be divorces or divorces you know people are divorced but 

227.09 228.21 A: mhm 

231.94 232.72 A: (( true )) 

233.30 238.01 B: in this case i don't think they really tried 

236.57 242.17 A: yeah well i think these days it's easy for people to throw away relationships very easily 

242.22 243.51 A: and uh 

242.32 244.22 B: right 

243.60 252.44 A: that's how it seems to go they don't take it as seriously as they should when they decide to get married and that's what can happen [noise] 

252.18 254.14 B: well i don't know if if 

254.17 260.79 B: see i mean i believe in a life partner but i don't know if a lot of younger people really do 

256.41 257.42 A: mhm 

260.57 266.37 A: yeah yeah i don't know there's so much divorce any more and and um 

266.39 271.43 A: people my age their parents even were divorced so it's just such a common thing that 

271.56 275.14 A: some people don't uh take marriage very seriously 

275.24 277.17 B: (( right right so do you )) 

275.95 282.84 A: i did but it was a very serious problem that uh caused our our split up and everything so 

282.77 284.69 B: yeah 

282.89 286.97 A: i did just not respect him anymore after some of the things he had done 

287.15 291.13 A: i could forgive him but i couldn't forget i got married very young 

291.49 297.84 A: i was eighteen and i think that was a big mistake for me now for some that might work out but for me it didn't 

297.62 308.06 B: yeah see i was twenty five and we were together for five years and i think that really made a difference i'm already telling my kids don't get married right away don't get married so young 

300.59 301.79 A: mhm 

307.75 308.75 A: yeah 

308.13 318.22 B: you know that and i think that five year we went through a lot a lot in five years before we got married that let's say a lot of married people don't even go through 

318.20 327.94 B: and we were separated and we had illness and we had all kinds of stuff and we said you know if we can make it through these first five years we can make it through anything 

327.51 328.59 A: mhm 

327.91 334.03 B: but that was before we had children [laughter] children really change things i think 

330.12 331.04 A: yeah 

333.36 335.30 A: oh they do definitely 

335.36 336.29 A: yeah 

335.44 337.35 B: yeah 

336.35 340.52 A: yeah my sister uh got married about a year ago and uh 

340.66 350.37 A: she's lost some of her friends that she used to have because they don't understand what it's like for someone with children not to be able to go out doing the things they used to do 

350.42 353.96 A: so she's lost some of her friends but and that happened to me too 

354.20 359.14 B: well my sister just had a baby she's been was married two years but she's older she's forty 

358.95 372.90 B: and she just had her first and has called me already the baby is six weeks and called me like once a week and said now i know what you meant [laughter] now i see and already she is seeing things that you can't 

368.58 369.73 A: mhm 

374.01 383.17 B: that that in your partner or in your friends or in your family you can't really ever go through unless you are part of that you know having children club i think 

382.47 384.16 A: that's true mhm 

384.29 385.43 B: yeah 

384.82 390.98 A: and her husband does not understand either that she still wants to go out i think part of it is him 

391.27 405.74 A: and uh there has to be a give and take there and now my husband on the other hand i have the same independence you have [noise] if i say i'd like to go do this or that that's fine you know i can go do that i don't have to [noise] ask permission or 

391.32 393.18 B: yeah 

394.76 396.79 B: yeah i have 

404.09 407.27 B: (( yeah )) 

406.30 415.41 A: but some are so controlling and for me um the importance in a life partner [noise] is not to uh you know have someone who's so controlling 

415.46 416.39 A: either 

415.56 421.40 B: right yeah some people do want that though i mean i think whether they know it or not um 

417.88 418.89 A: mhm 

420.29 427.58 A: yeah they do they encourage it they don't stop it from the beginning now if my husband had done that in the beginning i would have put a stop to it [laughter] 

426.82 431.64 B: right right yeah i mean i my husband's great he's um 

431.74 438.55 B: there's some times i think he's he just is not real strong or maybe can't handle things and then 

438.51 444.62 B: i'll be darned he always comes through i mean just i i've had some really major 

444.39 453.86 B: family like medical things going on in the last three years and i've had to fly out fly out of where i live and far away and he has been fabulous 

453.39 454.81 A: mhm 

453.97 461.28 B: he's just been um and so all the other things that maybe we don't agree on there's just still this very deep 

461.30 463.50 B: um bond that 

463.90 469.30 B: i he'll all if something were to happen to him tomorrow i would probably never remarry 

468.27 473.41 A: mhm yeah i've said the same thing and it's because i can never again find someone that would compare to him 

473.49 480.37 A: not because of the things that i don't care for about him but it's the things that i do i just don't feel i could find someone 

480.44 481.77 A: that would uh 

482.34 484.86 A: be as good as him [laughter] really 

484.06 497.18 B: right right yeah it's interesting because you said you've been married nine years and i've seen the shift between nine and fourteen um oh i should say between ten and fourteen as my kids get older and i think that's where our backgrounds 

497.38 506.20 B: are are different similarly different backgrounds have really been interesting because i have a daughter and he did not grow up with any girls 

506.27 520.21 B: and his mother was not very feminine and i'm seeing a lot of conflict because of our different backgrounds um i wish he had had a sister i think it would make my life a lot easier he's trying to be very very strict 

519.90 521.16 A: yeah 

520.53 525.49 B: and you just can't do that i mean you've got to give these girls some some leeway 

524.08 530.15 A: right yeah if you're too strict then when they do have some freedom they'll possibly go wild 

529.99 535.48 B: right or yes see i just don't want the backlash when i really don't think it's necessary 

534.72 536.78 A: (( yeah yeah that's right )) 

535.89 541.26 B: i think there's just a lot of other ways that you can you know it's like 

541.43 542.93 B: choose your battles 

542.62 543.90 A: mhm 

543.33 546.41 B: you have older boys you know that choose your battles 

545.92 557.97 A: yeah and there there are some problems between my husband and my older boys um with them cleaning their rooms and different conflicts like that and i think he's a little harder on them 

546.75 547.91 B: (( right )) 

558.38 561.61 A: sometimes because they're not his children 

562.06 573.58 A: but i'm not the type that says okay you can't discipline my children either because he he isn't unfair really most of the time sometimes i can see a little bit but um 

562.25 563.96 B: right 

572.68 579.40 B: so do your do your kids um see them do they see him as like your final life partner 

579.30 583.03 A: yeah yeah i think they'd be very upset if anything were to happen 

583.07 584.39 A: yeah i'm sure 

583.23 585.90 B: yeah well that's good 

584.63 585.77 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

586.46 599.23 B: that's good because i'm at the age where i see i'm seeing a lot of divorces now it seems like when they reach these teenage years there's a lot of divorces and it it's either really good or really bad there doesn't um 

599.25 599.89 B: there there
