11.32 15.98 A: and i just registered last night so i'm excited that i got the phone call 

14.30 15.51 B: oh 

15.98 20.07 B: um i'm in canada sounds like you're in the states

25.22 26.54 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

26.83 27.92 B: (( yeah )) 

27.37 29.45 A: so anyway 

29.46 33.18 A: now we're supposed to wait for a cue or a prompt or what 

32.93 37.96 B: i think we just talk um the topic is life partners 

38.56 40.03 A: okay and 

39.12 45.20 B: i don't know if we wait for a prompt i think we just talk and then they let us know when ten minutes is up 

45.29 50.94 A: oh okay so the most important thing to look for a life partner what do you feel is is 

50.68 51.86 B: um 

51.97 53.67 B: i feel um 

54.43 56.49 B: honesty is important 

57.10 58.47 B: um 

59.40 61.31 B: loyalty [laughter] 

61.42 64.77 B: you know someone who's going to be faithful um 

61.46 62.49 A: right 

65.22 67.40 B: someone who um 

68.09 72.15 B: genuinely loves you or who cares about and um 

72.32 75.62 B: you know someone who has good morals i think that's 

75.79 77.91 B: uh the most important to me 

78.14 81.07 A: that's most important to me too uh 

80.09 80.96 B: oh 

82.81 84.87 B: anything else you would look for 

83.11 83.97 A: okay 

85.31 100.26 A: uh basically that would be the number one thing i would look for would be for honesty and integrity and the loyalty fidelity would be a big big issue with me because i've seen so many relationships and marriages destroyed 

90.03 90.85 B: uh-huh 

100.65 107.29 A: so um yeah that would that's definitely at the top and when you mentioned that about morals um 

107.69 115.45 A: i am and i say this unashamedly i'm a christian and i would want somebody that would share my christian 

111.13 111.92 B: uh-huh 

115.80 116.75 A: (( uh )) 

116.87 118.58 A: that was a christian as well 

118.72 121.89 A: they might not all the theology but that's 

121.12 122.16 B: yeah 

122.30 123.92 A: definitely important 

122.35 124.69 B: i understand yeah 

125.12 126.69 A: so that's important 

126.24 131.81 B: yeah do you are you um on your own or do you have a partner right now if 

131.86 134.01 A: okay i am married and 

132.67 134.92 B: you don't mind me asking [laughter] 

134.91 143.63 A: no i don't mind i've been married it'll soon be twenty five years and i was uh married for six years and divorced for two 

135.77 136.63 B: oh 

138.48 140.04 B: oh my gosh 

143.24 144.40 B: oh 

143.72 153.16 A: so i've been down that road that's the reason of fidelity when you mentioned that yeah that's a big issue with me and honesty because if you can't trust somebody 

151.12 152.02 B: yeah 

153.31 156.47 B: yeah that's that would make life miserable 

153.94 155.70 A: (( you know and their word's )) 

156.47 160.62 A: yeah if their word's not good then what good are they 

160.09 161.37 B: yeah 

161.59 164.62 A: so and then when somebody lies to you 

164.80 167.97 A: you have a tendency to lose respect for them 

167.99 178.63 A: and then when you lose respect for a person they start to become child like and you kind of treat them that way you just kind of are indifferent because you can't believe 'em 

176.91 179.33 B: yeah i think you have a good point 

180.30 181.25 A: so 

181.49 182.98 A: anyway and you

252.72 255.98 B: well having a a good partner um 

256.53 258.49 B: oh good is too general a word 

258.51 259.66 B: um 

260.99 263.29 B: someone who's going to be honest with you 

264.84 267.69 B: but not too bluntly honest [laughter] you know 

267.35 269.01 A: (( right [laughter] ))

275.65 276.76 A: uh 

277.14 281.48 A: i'm trying to think of exactly the communication is a big part of it 

281.54 283.11 A: and uh 

283.75 296.12 A: i guess that would be the big and i enjoy having somebody that i can be authentic with that i can be real around i don't feel like i'm i can just be myself and i can have a partner that 

291.06 292.05 B: yeah 

296.73 300.74 A: likes me despite my differences or flaws and 

300.10 302.80 B: yeah that sounds very important 

301.29 307.28 A: they get to see the bad the bad part of me and love me despite my faults 

305.60 306.65 B: yeah 

306.96 309.15 B: the good with the bad [laughter]

312.34 313.87 A: oh gosh 

315.44 319.22 B: i don't know if i can say that about my partner he 

319.42 320.37 B: um

367.94 370.03 B: yeah that's true [laughter] 

369.45 381.48 A: but uh i don't know i guess being nurtured too i enjoy that i can't deny that and and i'm appreciative and i would look for this in somebody too this really doesn't have anything to do with a person but 

381.94 385.71 A: financial situation that's important to me 

385.36 387.86 B: yeah that's helps [laughter]

406.63 407.85 B: yeah 

410.42 414.29 B: well you must have gone through a lot of changes in twenty five years 

414.04 423.14 A: oh my goodness [laughter] well you know with kids that's a big change and then my mother and father um both of them are elderly
