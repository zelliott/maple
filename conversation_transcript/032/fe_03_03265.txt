55.77 59.46 B: [noise] well i like to say that it's er communication as 

59.46 60.27 A: (( mhm )) 

59.63 63.28 B: long as you have a good line of communication you can ah 

63.16 76.18 B: as you see it have lots of fun together and ah if you have a good ah line of communication between the two of you if anything comes up hey you can just hash it out you know 

66.47 67.43 A: right 

74.37 75.83 A: exactly 

75.87 76.67 A: yeah 

76.06 82.50 B: just just just just just talk about it until you ah can figure it out or figure out how to handle it 

82.02 83.28 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

83.14 87.21 B: or figure out what to ah [noise] what to do about it 

86.94 88.25 A: right 

87.99 89.03 B: (( you know )) 

88.93 93.59 A: right 'cause if you don't have that communication then you'll end up just like fighting or you ah 

93.61 100.39 A: you know you keep it inside and you know it comes out later into some other form you don't even know what it is 

100.65 101.61 A: (( you know you )) 

100.70 104.90 B: yeah and then and then you react ah you react to it the wrong way 

104.51 106.89 A: right right 

106.15 110.18 B: [noise] and you know once you do that it's it's hard to take back 

109.39 111.14 A: mhm 

111.17 112.20 B: (( [noise] you know )) 

112.64 117.41 B: [noise] i guess i'm learning i'm i'm probably a lot older than you are i'm sixty two 

117.17 119.11 A: oh [laughter] 

117.65 124.58 B: [noise] and believe it or not when you get older somehow you do get wiser you don't get to know everything but you 

124.77 127.32 B: you learn certain things ah [noise] 

127.61 134.89 B: that ah you know help you along and you learn how to do things without ah letting them become ah 

130.13 131.29 A: right 

135.36 138.41 B: headaches you know you just cut 'em off at the pass 

137.90 138.75 A: uh-huh 

138.59 146.37 B: that's because you've seen it before [noise] and you recognize it and you decide that ah you don't want to get into it 

145.34 148.10 A: mhm yeah i can 

146.88 148.09 B: and that's 

148.11 150.21 B: and that's good 

149.37 151.56 A: yeah [laughter] that's definitely good 

150.99 152.85 B: yeah 

151.67 161.10 A: yeah i'm learning i'm twenty four and i'm also learning it too ah you know that it is about the communication because ah before it would be just ah 

155.43 156.53 B: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

161.61 175.80 A: you know you if somebody did something that you didn't like then just you don't even have you either like explode or you get mad right away you kinda just hold it back and then like kick it out in another way that doesn't get anybody anywhere but the right 

173.47 181.81 B: well that's right that's right when you hold it back it only festers inside of you and it it'll burst out [sigh] sooner or later 

180.71 181.95 A: right 

181.88 184.68 B: and more than likely it will bust out the wrong way 

184.36 191.94 A: right so you gotta find the right way to say it like and do it in in a positive way that'll get you somewhere 

191.36 194.52 B: [sigh] yeah yeah where are you

446.24 461.01 A: but ah he was already like he was playing the whole time it was just that he he was getting injured and ah then he really demanded a lot more money ah for h- like he was getting a new contract and he was asking for more money than like than definitely than he was worth 

460.66 461.72 B: uh-huh 

460.96 468.07 A: so the nicks just said you know we're not going to pay you that much so ah he went to seattle and then he retired after that because he didn't really play too well there
