346.57 348.25 A: let me ask you something 

347.63 348.64 B: sure 

349.91 355.09 A: if you found somebody that had all the same beliefs as you did 

351.75 352.63 B: uh-huh 

354.75 355.84 B: yeah 

355.24 357.58 A: but his money situation

375.18 376.17 A: right 

377.59 385.16 A: if if he is everything else you said yeah where where he's supportive of the family um 

380.38 381.35 B: yeah 

383.67 384.62 B: uh-huh 

385.25 388.58 A: you know et cetera et cetera non smoker vegetarian 

387.93 389.49 B: yeah 

389.18 392.15 A: but he didn't have the financial backing 

392.13 403.30 B: that's okay with me because if he is educated he is honest he is a person with good character i am sure that you know he will you know eventually he will uh 

403.40 405.05 B: (( [mn] get )) 

405.23 413.90 B: control of his life you know of his finances and like for example i'm working and if he is not working that's okay with me 

413.72 420.32 B: um at least he's trying to get some work and he is you know hard working and a good person 

420.37 426.23 B: so that's okay with me that he he should not be a very extra rich person but i definitely don't 

426.27 439.82 B: want that he should not have unlimited debts on him or he is filing for bankruptcy and all that type of thing i don't care if he does not have a house or he does not have a car that's okay with me but uh 

440.13 441.82 B: so i mean 

442.25 443.20 B: uh 

442.55 446.35 A: okay let's let's reverse it what if he has none of the beliefs 

446.71 449.32 A: as you but he has the money 

449.50 450.75 B: (( uh )) 

450.64 451.70 A: (( and so )) 

450.85 455.10 B: no then i won't go for that person because uh 

455.41 465.20 B: uh i mean money's not the most important thing in life the most important thing is compatibility and love for each other so um 

465.25 476.06 B: i don't think so that like i don't care if he's very rich or not if he's rich it's good but um only if he's has money i won't go for that person 

472.49 473.19 A: (( in )) 

475.94 479.97 A: other words if you have respect for one other 

479.62 480.68 B: yeah 

480.08 482.20 A: and your values are the same 

481.83 482.84 B: yeah 

482.21 484.31 A: that's the type of thing you're looking for 

484.07 485.06 B: yeah 

486.20 487.88 A: that's about where i 

488.33 491.26 A: i've come to [laughter] 

490.97 492.15 B: yeah 

492.33 493.40 A: i uh 

495.22 499.47 A: yeah if you've got the same beliefs if you're working for the same goals 

499.25 500.60 B: yeah 

500.95 508.34 A: you know that's when it all comes together at some point um as long as you can support each other emotionally
