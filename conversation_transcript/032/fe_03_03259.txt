74.50 76.32 B: right right 

75.87 76.95 A: um 

77.18 80.45 A: i don't know what's the most important thing to look for in a life partner 

80.86 82.28 A: i guess ah 

82.84 83.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

84.10 85.96 A: (( i don't know what i would say ah )) 

86.04 92.47 A: you know maybe a sense of humour something like that i mean the the idea for me it's just i can't imagine you know 

88.13 89.52 B: [sigh] yeah i think 

92.69 96.36 A: fifty years from now not being bored of just about anyone 

96.13 98.31 B: [lipsmack] e- exactly [laughter] 

97.11 99.10 A: [laughter] 

99.41 100.49 B: (( yeah do you mean )) 

99.62 100.99 A: (( i mean i don't know )) 

100.97 113.23 B: yeah we i just see my my parents who are you know near seventy and and they just drive each other nuts they don't ah [laughter] they're you know th- they're they're i guess sort of bored of each other and that seems to be the norm people get to that age there ah 

106.77 108.09 A: (( [noise] right )) 

113.44 122.32 B: you know they've just they they know so much about each other there's not doesn't seem to be a lot of enjoyment it's mostly just trying to minimize the annoym- the annoyance [laughter] 

121.20 121.92 A: [laughter] 

122.31 124.65 A: yeah so what do you do to avoid that i don't know 

124.45 131.02 B: i i i don't know um i i guess that's when you find your life partner you know that it's it's the right situation it's a thing you can do 

131.04 132.74 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] i i guess 

132.65 137.39 B: you know i mean when you're when you're young you're looking for the physical attraction 

137.30 148.74 B: and ah you know that has a lot to do with it and that gets you together to begin with but then when you look at okay twenty thirty fifty d- years down the road obviously that part is gone and it doesn't really matter much any more anyway 

141.55 142.92 A: mhm 

148.81 155.61 B: so ah the ability to to to talk about anything and to communicate and to be you know 

152.01 153.42 A: mhm 

155.64 156.52 B: (( to [sigh] )) 

156.90 163.14 B: to ah [sigh] i guess be a hallmark card about it to be able to be best friends you know 

161.33 164.37 A: (( [noise] [laughter] uh yeah right )) 

163.37 171.50 B: [laughter] it has to be that way you have to [sigh] try you know we're we're really into travelling [lipsmack] and ah everyone travels differently we're able to travel 

171.35 182.59 B: very inexpensively and ah you know without much of a plan and that's a huge thing i've travelled with other people that have to have have to know exactly where they're going and what's happening next and know what the plan is 

176.50 177.73 A: right 

182.45 187.74 B: and that just doesn't work out and that's not that's not a life partner type thing for me [laughter] 

187.10 188.65 A: (( [noise] right okay [noise] )) 

189.23 193.31 A: so that's one thing you're looking for i mean i don't know anything else ah 

194.83 197.46 B: [lipsmack] um [lipsmack] gosh i guess ah 

197.97 207.34 B: somebody is is generally positive i you know i guess i guess everyone probably thinks they're generally positive about the world maybe but i i think i am and 

206.38 212.32 A: well if you should come to spend some time in new york and see if you still say that [laughter] 

208.42 221.25 B: [laughter] [laughter] people [sigh] people aren't positive and they're not they're they're they're not shy to announce that they're not happy about it [laughter] true very true 

218.28 219.98 A: right 

221.75 227.03 A: no but actually no i do agree ah in general so i'm sorry i cut you off there what what were you going to say 

226.59 230.96 B: oh no problem i i i think that you know you really need to find somebody who 

230.89 234.91 B: ah who has the same attributes as far as being able to 

234.79 248.11 B: live spontaneously versus a planned life and ah you know do they know what's coming next or is whatever happens gonna be okay and you'll figure out what the what the best thing happen you know t- to make happen is after that 

235.19 236.28 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

244.99 246.78 A: mhm 

249.13 249.80 A: (( hm )) 

249.42 253.49 B: to me t- i guess to me that's it i'm fairly spontaneous and if i was with 

253.47 268.24 B: someone who was not also spontaneous and comfortable with that then it would be just not the r- not just not the right thing um so that's me i know a lot of people are not spontaneous so that's not a big deal for them so there are other there are other attributes i guess when a for a life a life partner 

256.21 257.94 A: (( [noise] right )) 

269.13 271.30 A: so um wait how old are you greg 

271.06 272.56 B: i'm thirty six 

272.40 277.72 A: okay right i'm ah twenty six i guess alm- almost twenty seven 

273.35 274.43 B: how 'bout yourself 

275.76 276.57 B: okay 

277.32 278.05 B: uh-huh 

279.21 280.44 A: but um 

281.41 284.05 A: it's hard to believe that in the next 

284.95 287.01 A: you know x. years i don't know 

287.16 290.93 A: ten years that i- 

291.19 293.31 A: i'm going to find my life partner 

293.35 296.47 A: it just doesn't the maths doesn't seem right i don't know 

297.26 299.50 B: really you don't you don't think it could happen tomorrow 

297.61 298.51 A: i'm 

299.86 303.19 A: ah geez i mean i guess it could but i 

300.92 302.19 B: [laughter] 

303.41 308.75 A: it's just one of these things where like if you think about on paper like okay what a- are the things i'm looking for 

308.98 311.74 A: like when you actually meet people 

312.25 314.68 A: th- i don't know you don't really 

315.11 318.36 A: those aren't the qualifications that you're really using to 

318.52 326.88 A: narrow people down or whatever you know i you don't meet someone and immediately start talking about how they like to travel in your case or like how they do you know what i mean 

326.46 327.68 B: (( [noise] right [lipsmack] )) 

327.25 333.30 A: how spont- i mean like you find out those things about people eventually but 

334.22 339.93 A: you know you know what i'm saying like it takes a long time to actually come to learn the things that are important so 

340.22 341.96 A: is there some way of ah 

344.03 346.22 A: of learning these things quickly 

345.84 346.82 B: (( right i )) 

346.33 347.42 A: (( you see what i mean )) 

346.99 350.41 B: yeah i i i guess you know from the time i was ah 

350.59 362.08 B: wh- when you start really thinking about these things and and you know what are you going to do with the rest of your life maybe when you're around twenty or twenty two or something like that to the point when i got i was maybe th- you know 

358.38 359.97 A: right 

362.16 364.04 B: thirty or thirty one 

363.89 370.76 B: and you know i had a lot of relationships and knew from the start that some of them were not going to be a permanent thing it was just a 

370.57 380.69 B: you know this is what i'm doing now and it it's the right thing to do now and it's fun and it's good and you learn and ah you know it's a happy thing but then at some point it comes to an end you just know it's not going to be 

372.31 373.44 A: right right 

380.63 393.48 B: a happy thing forever so it's just best to cut the losses at some point and you know be be thankful for the good times we had but um you know you start to think you know okay what is what is the ideal ah relationship and person ab- all about [lipsmack] 

393.56 394.55 A: mhm 

393.70 397.94 B: and ah you know without looking for it and i its its sort of ah 

398.01 410.43 B: you know it's what you hear so many people say they weren't they weren't looking for the relationship or the person it just happens it that person just shows up and that that's how it happened for me it was certainly not a a planned thing it was not a 

402.84 405.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

410.43 418.95 B: ah not something i was i was out on the hunt for it just happened and you know then you realize at some point hey this is this is really it [laughter] which is great 

413.81 415.49 A: right 

417.88 418.96 A: yeah so 

419.22 425.59 A: it's it's like maybe you're almost saying that it's sort of misleading to think of it as what's the most important thing you're looking for because 

426.44 429.90 A: you don't really find it by looking for it you know what i mean 

429.55 434.66 B: yeah it it just comes upon you and at some point it's okay you're kind of back into it 

432.21 433.37 A: right 

434.79 442.37 B: you be realize okay there there is somebody who's got all these qualities and enjoys the things that i enjoy and this is it as opposed to 

438.90 440.80 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

442.56 447.60 B: you know you write it down on paper these are the top twenty things i'm looking for and if you can find it great [sigh] 

445.57 447.25 A: yeah right 

448.47 452.88 A: um i don't know so you know i know you're talking to a stranger but do you want to tell me about ah 

453.12 457.46 A: what your ah your views are on marriage as to why you wouldn't want to get married or whatever [noise] 

457.77 460.13 B: yeah we we're both um 

460.15 471.26 B: you know a little older than most people are [mn] ah and have not been married and we we both sort of fell into it i just always assumed i would get married and have a traditional family type life so did she 

471.17 471.95 A: uh-huh 

471.19 475.62 B: but ah she's a little bit older than i am um she's like five years older 

475.46 476.26 A: okay 

475.82 489.99 B: and you know we got to a certain age she was late thirties and i'm mid thirties and you know we're we're living this life and [lipsmack] um realized you know no matter how good a relationship is we've seen a lot of people who 

490.09 496.97 B: ah who had lived together or had great relationships and got married and you know it either didn't enhance anything or 

496.64 497.75 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

496.99 500.68 B: things fell to shit pretty quickly [laughter] so ah 

500.13 501.83 A: right 

500.76 512.07 B: we you know we sort of just feel ah like the the the bond that you have is internal it's between those two people and the fact that the governor says it's okay you know by a piece of paper 

510.58 512.91 A: [laughter] right 

512.31 514.68 B: doesn't really make a big difference so [lipsmack] 

514.82 522.41 B: ah you know there's all kinds of legal things associated with it and financial things that if you don't have to deal with why would you 

522.55 528.73 B: and we d- we feel it it's less and less important to have ah 

528.81 537.11 B: you know legitimacy legitimacy in the eyes of society you know this is a much more acceptable way to live than it was even ten or twenty years ago [noise] 

533.42 534.58 A: right 

537.05 538.54 A: yeah definitely 

537.76 548.98 B: and maybe if we were in the same situation twenty years ago we would we'd say okay we we'd better get married you know this is just what we've got have to do and we you know i mean the other big thing is we're not having kids we've decided to stay kid free 

548.10 549.63 A: okay right [noise] 

548.92 554.58 B: um if i- if kids were to be involved then yeah i would i would look at something i would look at ah 

554.58 566.84 B: you know marriage in the same situation [noise] but ah but we're not going to so we kind of have all those things going for us and it's sort of a dare you know it pisses off all of our friends who did get married [laughter] 

564.32 570.95 A: yeah right [laughter] i mean um that's something i hear from my parents and everyone who's 

571.47 576.96 A: older than me basically is that the older you get the less you do care about um 

577.49 580.95 A: conforming to society in those types of ways you know what i mean 

580.03 581.98 B: mhm yeah exactly 

581.40 585.05 A: and you just start realizing well this is silly like what's the point you know 

585.43 587.83 A: just because everyone else does this you know whatever 

587.58 596.35 B: yeah it's it's ah an institution that that you know was very important for a long time and it was the norm but it's it's no longer such a such a big deal 

596.05 597.39 A: mhm 

596.49 599.89 B: and it's sort of doing it for somebody else i guess that's the thing and a lot
