203.74 205.28 B: (( just uh mm )) 

206.16 209.95 A: really [laughter] my my dad used to have a german shepherd 

209.55 210.71 B: okay 

210.65 216.11 A: best thing is that barked at everything and they thought it it like tried to bite people and stuff [noise] 

216.62 219.63 B: yeah well that's what my my dog she uh 

220.07 224.73 B: i trained her i had her since she was a couple of weeks old well 

224.85 227.62 B: yeah since she was old enough to leave like eight weeks 

227.83 231.61 B: (( i bought her as soon as she soon as she was ready to go )) 

232.03 241.51 B: and i trained her to be like a a a guard dog and a pet dog for me at the time it was me my mom my dad my sister 

242.09 244.24 B: well my sister had a baby 

244.46 253.83 B: after i had the dog so she didn't know the baby so she was when you like take the baby to the back door she'd start growling and acting all crazy 

248.56 249.42 A: oh 

254.84 255.77 B: so 

256.45 257.51 A: really 

257.06 259.71 B: (( yeah i was like okay )) 

259.15 260.84 A: that's kinda scary 

260.42 275.24 B: it is it is i didn't know she was going to get like that but i guess i mean 'cause i didn't take her around i would like 'cause you let people become real friendly with your dog like take it outside and let him pet your dog and stuff like that they'll become real friendly and so 

275.39 283.85 B: there's no need in them being like any type of guard dog because a person just come up to him and pet him and they they'll stop barking they might stop barking 

283.94 284.86 A: right 

284.53 286.82 B: where you can't approach my dog 

287.23 288.08 B: if 

287.49 290.10 A: and you're saying it's because you didn't like 

290.15 296.42 B: well i didn't know it was going to be that bad i just thought it was just going to i didn't know that but i mean i i guess 

290.43 292.03 A: expose it to people 

292.28 293.31 A: yeah 

296.56 298.49 B: i trained her to protect 

298.56 310.38 B: the four of us i didn't think that if she seen like somebody else in the house but i guess she figures if there's somebody else in the house that she sees that's not one of us four then it must be a problem 

307.22 307.82 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

309.76 310.75 A: right 

311.06 311.93 B: so 

312.14 326.52 A: yes i think that's the problem that my dad had like he didn't take or the german shepherd out like around people when it was younger and so then like anyone that wasn't in the family that like came near our family the dog would like go crazy 

317.44 318.43 B: uh-huh 

324.10 325.01 B: uh-huh 

326.48 327.59 B: [laughter]

333.14 334.52 B: uh yeah [laughter] 

333.92 344.93 A: and that we'd like lose the house and like [laughter] because of that my dad was like always like we're going to get rid of the dog and i hate the dog because he's going to cause us to lose our house and like all of this sort of stuff 

345.16 345.99 A: but 

345.81 351.88 B: yeah my dog almost got me hit by a car when i first got her well when she was about or close to about one
