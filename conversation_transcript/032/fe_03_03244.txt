58.99 60.73 B: corporate ethics 

60.51 64.85 A: [mn] right exactly i mean i think it definitely has to do with um 

65.21 66.94 A: the kind of general 

67.34 71.90 A: laxness in terms of what's been acceptable you know for pe- how people 

72.22 78.40 A: at the top i mean even now like a lot of the people that got away with a lot of money [noise] 

78.64 82.47 A: in those situations where while there's all the em- employees 

82.60 93.61 A: were suffering those people still have the money [laughter] you know in millions of dollars i think that's very disturbing that they're they're really not being brought to justice 

86.48 87.73 B: that's right 

90.40 91.47 B: right 

93.72 99.45 A: but i mean as far as the recession i think there's so many different things involved i mean i think that

101.66 102.68 A: (( corporate )) 

102.91 110.82 A: problems but there's also been you know a war and there's been you know september eleventh and there's just been a lot of other things going on

111.85 112.95 A: yeah 

116.39 119.02 A: you know i think that had a big impact too 

119.74 121.28 A: that we're still feeling 

123.91 125.35 B: (( [sigh] [noise] well [noise] )) 

125.36 128.38 B: most of these companies were in the um 

129.54 137.95 B: i was just reading the other day where a._o._l. made up millions of dollars in advertising income they had 

137.75 138.58 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

139.08 144.28 B: and they didn't even have it just made it up out of thin air 

144.12 145.25 A: really 

144.98 146.84 B: yeah 

146.14 147.75 A: how did they do that 

148.27 151.36 B: uh they just wrote that they'd had it 

151.12 153.01 A: [laughter] 

152.33 153.83 B: made it up 

153.32 155.67 A: [laughter] right i mean just 

154.63 157.25 B: to make their books look good 

156.60 160.32 A: it just doesn't like you should be able to do that you know [laughter] 

159.76 160.74 B: [laughter] 

161.01 165.54 A: [laughter] i mean i can't do that with my taxes you know if i got audited 

165.22 166.65 B: right 

166.05 168.74 A: then i'd have major problems so 

168.31 173.90 B: well if we're audited i guess and somebody said well where's this where was all this 

174.02 178.79 B: and they said well i'd have to look and find out and they found out they didn't even have it 

178.23 180.33 A: [noise] my gosh that's amazing 

180.24 181.26 B: right

200.21 206.75 A: yeah yeah they're pretty good we do all right i mean some schools are not very good but you know 

206.53 208.24 B: yeah 

207.77 208.96 A: we do okay 

209.14 219.92 A: but it's interesting yeah i guess neither of us i mean i think a lot of the areas where like texas and you know some of those places got really affected and like whole towns and cities 

220.50 224.63 A: i mean to me you know appeared nine eleven was a bigger effect than 

220.64 221.49 B: right 

225.01 227.38 A: any of these corporate scandals but 

229.30 233.24 B: well that that when enron went under 

233.62 238.54 B: they started investigating these companies and there was c._b.s 

238.81 242.74 B: (( s. or or or s._b._c. or something )) 

243.06 243.83 A: (( hm )) 

243.50 246.18 B: that telecommunications company 

246.07 247.12 A: right 

247.66 250.76 B: and there was um 

251.66 254.80 B: another one i can't think of the name of it 

254.48 258.68 A: there was big one that just was completely that went bust 

256.24 262.28 B: (( yeah the cable company and they had the ma- moldy like moldy products )) 

262.10 263.08 A: mhm 

262.79 264.96 B: and they were in the scandal 

264.94 265.66 A: (( yes )) 

265.73 267.87 B: and when those things happen 

268.26 271.29 B: (( you wonder how any more of them happened )) 

271.02 272.07 A: right 

271.56 274.92 B: that we don't know about and am i invested in one 

275.54 276.79 A: oh really 

276.72 280.73 B: i'm not i've but i won- do people wonder that i think 

280.03 282.34 A: oh right right right [noise] [noise] [noise] 

281.87 283.44 B: and um 

284.36 288.38 B: like these corporate businesses will do anything 

289.54 291.10 B: to um 

292.77 295.98 B: meet wall street's expectations 

295.68 299.02 A: yeah i mean all they care about is the bottom line that's for sure 

298.99 303.26 B: right and they got to make the certain amount of profit every year 

299.48 300.38 A: (( yeah )) 

302.92 304.50 A: yeah and i 

303.33 306.14 B: unless they go up a certain amount every year 

305.46 309.20 A: right that's the key thing they want to make sure that they're going up you know 

309.08 310.20 B: yeah 

309.48 312.71 A: so they don't really care how they get to those numbers you 

312.80 314.59 A: (( know whatever's happening or [noise] [noise] )) 

313.14 320.59 B: and some people don't even know how the numbers are arrived at they look and see well their profits are up and 

320.79 327.82 B: uh earnings per share are up and maybe it's a company they invest in 

327.90 328.87 A: mhm 

328.93 331.05 B: they show a high uh 

331.07 333.64 B: asset well big assets 

333.81 341.74 B: a large number of assets that's a secure company they figure and that could all be very misleading 

335.79 336.62 A: right 

341.39 342.22 A: (( yes i )) 

342.35 345.35 A: mean all those statistics can be so cooked you know 

344.52 348.97 B: i know they're generally people that generally know what they're doing investing 

349.57 350.50 A: right 

350.31 352.43 B: i was where what 

350.57 351.43 A: when i 

351.74 360.92 A: go ahead well i was just going to say i mean i think it's interesting because uh all these scandals kind of coincided with the end of an era where [lipsmack] 

361.05 366.29 A: there was a shift where people individuals started investing more in the stock market on their own 

366.18 367.20 B: yeah 

366.47 369.49 A: you know as opposed to earlier when it was only like 

368.34 372.86 B: though some people didn't even uh they were just putting money in the market 

372.33 375.37 A: right exactly they didn't even know you know anything 

374.92 378.93 B: they were praying they would get double in one year or something 

378.78 380.01 A: right be- 

378.95 381.60 B: like gambling on horses or something 

381.31 385.72 A: because we you know we there was so much increase when that when the bubble 

383.99 386.70 B: yeah in nasdaq especially 

386.70 390.43 A: right and so everyone thought that that was just going to keep going [noise] 

387.70 389.16 B: technology 

390.19 392.00 B: yeah 

391.24 396.20 A: which is i mean if we look historically obviously it's not going to you know it never holds i 

396.20 397.99 B: yeah 

397.01 398.86 A: mean there's always going to be a 

399.30 400.22 A: um 

400.33 401.99 B: yeah 

401.66 408.06 A: but i guess no one expected it to crash this hard and i think it's going to get worse personally 

408.60 409.91 B: i think 

410.05 414.67 B: i think unless the government can crack down it's going to get worse 

414.89 415.80 A: right 

415.89 421.06 A: and well and i think personally with i think with this government it's unlikely that they're going to crack down on them 

421.58 425.43 B: i agree um i think bush is probably 

425.87 429.54 B: ineffective in bringing the economy around 

428.92 432.22 A: yeah and he's also i mean he's kind of a corporate 

432.92 434.63 A: guy himself 

434.14 437.43 B: [noise] he go- he doesn't want to hurt them too bad 

437.22 440.21 A: right i mean i think that you know the a lot of those 

440.27 446.01 A: the corporate sector was a big supporter of his campaign you know so he doesn't want to start hitting them 

443.42 445.30 B: yeah right right 

446.30 450.14 A: [noise] too hard i mean he's he's just doing what he has to do to keep 

446.61 447.86 B: that's right 

450.19 453.52 B: so the government's not going to do anything about the scandals 

450.53 452.03 A: [noise] make it look like it 

452.88 454.62 A: right exactly 

454.81 458.81 B: and people are not are still going to be uneasy about things 

455.10 456.06 A: but 

458.18 458.95 A: right 

459.38 465.03 A: and then that affects consumer spending too which hits the economy you know from another end 

463.11 466.18 B: it's starting to become that now too 

465.49 467.40 A: yeah exactly mhm 

467.47 472.10 B: and corporate and consumer spending i was reading 

472.31 476.78 B: a headline in a business magazine i get 

477.23 478.83 B: (( and it says )) 

479.87 483.40 B: business spending the key to recovery 

483.77 488.45 B: i thought that's just a small part of it it's consumer spending that makes it 

487.57 492.30 A: [noise] right absolutely and we we're taught you know in america it's like 

490.82 499.94 B: if if business starts increasing their investments in machinery equipment and payroll and everything and the customers don't buy 

500.52 501.38 A: right 

501.90 504.23 B: consumer confidence is down 

504.31 508.05 A: big time you know nobody's buying everybody's holding on 

505.46 506.40 B: right 

507.85 508.89 B: right 

508.16 515.10 A: and i mean that's you know we're built on a kind of a debt economy you go out use your credit card spend a lot of money 

514.70 516.22 B: yeah 

515.46 516.98 A: buy stuff 

517.47 518.68 A: and uh 

518.84 523.66 A: you know that's how how we keep growing so if people stop spending 

521.92 522.80 B: right 

523.72 526.38 A: it's just a downward spiral [noise] 

525.79 526.88 B: (( right [noise] )) 

527.49 532.41 A: people are getting definitely scared i know in new york there was a run on a bank actually 

532.66 534.11 A: this past week 

533.70 535.54 B: oh is that right 

534.94 548.36 A: yeah i mean it said it was in chinatown and there was um a manager a bank manager that was fired for embezzling like two million dollars or some very you know a very decent sum of money 

541.86 542.79 B: yeah 

546.54 549.49 B: (( [noise] quite a decent amount of money yeah [noise] )) 

548.78 559.79 A: yeah exactly and i mean it you know in that community it was just there was just so much fear that that meant that the bank was unsound that everybody came in to 

560.20 562.27 A: [noise] withdraw their money 

562.81 564.63 A: i mean it was an old fashioned 

564.63 566.96 A: you know depression era run and 

566.96 579.73 A: of course now we have f._d._i._c. insurance and everyone could withdraw their money and hopefully that would make them see that you know the bank is still stable and overcome it or recover but still just even to have that happen i thought was 

580.75 583.11 A: a bad sign [laughter] 

582.83 588.35 B: [noise] don't you feel that the government uh is controlled by business too sometimes 

588.01 589.41 A: absolutely 

589.83 597.65 B: and that business is calling the shots in the in the end unless things get too bad from the press 

589.98 591.28 A: absolutely 

594.43 595.21 A: (( yeah )) 

597.72 599.89 A: right i mean i think that the and i think that the pr
