241.12 243.84 A: yeah some of 'em didn't survive anyhow 

243.58 246.52 B: yeah we used to have an aquarium 

246.78 257.07 B: [sigh] and we went somewhere for christmas vacation [sigh] and something happened the storm knocked the lights out or something anyway the aquarium froze 

257.15 266.65 B: [sigh] and so of course when it thawed out all the fish were dead except the newt and he was still alive [sigh] i couldn't believe that it was like a prehistoric 

263.53 265.52 A: (( [noise] uh-hum [noise] )) 

266.64 275.76 B: m- monster you know frozen in the ice [mn] and when it thawed he was he just went right on his w- way [sigh] i'd never seen anything like that 

270.94 272.20 A: [laughter] really 

275.68 276.53 A: hm 

276.12 278.95 B: [mn] now here just lately i had a gecko 

279.77 284.12 B: [sigh] but we gave him to someone that had other geckos 

282.59 285.82 A: [noise] [noise] that's um a little lizard right 

284.97 286.42 B: right uh-huh 

285.86 287.04 A: (( [laughter] mm [noise] [noise] )) 

286.84 290.78 B: [lipsmack] named him flash because he moved so fast [sigh] [laughter] of 

290.81 303.95 B: course flash was kind of hard to take care of [sigh] i wasn't really sure what a g- gecko ate [sigh] [lipsmack] so it said that they eat bugs [sigh] so every day i'd send the kids out l- looking for bugs [mn] 

296.97 297.86 A: (( no [noise] )) 

303.81 312.12 B: and it couldn't be too big because he was little [sigh] or they couldn't be too hard they had to be little soft bugs and that was 

311.16 313.06 A: you looked for bugs 

312.58 316.31 B: yeah had to go look for 'em to feed my gecko [sigh] [noise] 

313.44 314.14 A: (( hm )) 

315.83 317.64 A: oh he couldn't feed himself 

317.97 319.91 B: no yo- well [lipsmack] 

319.95 322.65 B: if i put him outside it was still cold [sigh] 

322.61 323.39 A: (( [sigh] mm )) 

322.67 325.73 B: and he's from the desert and i didn't want him to freeze 

325.24 326.66 A: oh right no 

326.34 330.93 B: and if i take the lid off of his little aquarium then he would run away 

330.74 333.84 A: o- oh [laughter] don't want that to happen [laughter] 

333.37 338.91 B: yeah i had to import bugs [sigh] [mn] so every day i'd send them out looking for something 

335.62 336.92 A: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

339.12 347.85 B: [mn] but ah what they do is get on the side of buildings and l- little little tiny bugs that show up for the lights [sigh] is what they eat 

348.17 350.75 B: [mn] i said well i guess i could take him out them 

350.59 359.51 B: outside and put a light bulb in his pen and he could attract his own bugs [sigh] but as i said i found him a new home before he starved to death 

359.26 360.19 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

359.30 370.29 B: [sigh] and i don't know what this guy feeds him but he has several other he's got a skink and [sigh] a a chameleon so [sigh] he he's pretty up on feeding lizards though 

369.98 372.22 A: okay good [laughter] 

371.13 374.24 B: so you know i i'm sure he'll do fine now 

373.29 375.87 A: now he has his own bug supply 

375.21 382.45 B: yeah he has a a a professional bug getter [laughter] because like they r- 

375.91 376.78 A: [laughter] 

379.60 380.75 A: oh [sigh] 

381.21 383.95 A: there's a job for everyone [laughter] [laughter] 

382.97 386.83 B: really well this guys kind of a buggy [noise] guy so 

386.60 398.44 B: [laughter] the only thing is he hasn't brought my aquarium back [noise] yet i told him i wanted it back [noise] but i guess as long as he takes care of flash [noise] i'm not going to worry about the aquarium 

391.59 392.17 A: (( mm )) 

398.32 399.18 A: (( hm )) 

399.19 399.90 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

399.35 401.24 B: (( [noise] but anyhow [noise] )) 

401.43 403.62 B: [sigh] ah you said you live in new york 

403.63 412.10 A: yeah [sigh] yeah i see um i mean i had a friend who had a dog and [sigh] you know they don't have a yard or anything so 

404.36 405.50 B: (( okay mm )) 

412.27 419.90 A: the poor dog [laughter] i mean they take him to the park all the time but i [sigh] i don't know if i like seeing pet dogs here in manhattan [mn] [noise] 

419.38 431.40 B: well i was gonna ask i've seen on t._v. and movies where these professional walkers have like five or six or m- more dogs on leashes and they walking 'em all in one group [sigh] they really do that there 

428.10 428.91 A: yeah 

429.04 431.09 A: right uh-hum 

431.28 434.42 A: yeah ah a friend of mine was a dog walker [sigh] 

434.06 444.87 B: goodness [sigh] i don't know ah around here [sigh] like if you have two dogs that don't know each other real well [sigh] they want to fight i mean they're protecting their own territory 

435.23 436.32 A: (( uh-hum )) 

442.72 447.32 A: [sigh] that's true here as well so it's a tough job [laughter] 

445.97 453.27 B: i can imagine you know you get four or five especially if there's two males and they don't w- they don't know each other you know that would be dangerous 

450.91 464.94 A: [noise] [noise] i was always curious about that yeah because a- ah i have friends who walk their dogs they see another dog far away and they start barking they're not even n- near each other they're ready to tear each other apart [sigh] and then and then i see people all over [sigh] walking ah 

460.10 461.89 B: [noise] yeah 

464.97 474.65 A: you know oh one time i saw someone walking about ten or twelve dogs at once [laughter] [sigh] i couldn't believe like he was holding so [laughter] many leashes [sigh] ah 

472.92 476.50 B: [noise] mm well i understand though it pays pretty good 

476.84 477.90 B: (( [sigh] but ah )) 

477.09 480.29 A: i'm not sure what it pays but i guess it must huh [laughter] 

479.91 487.15 B: yeah especially i guess if you get ten or twelve of 'em [sigh] you you walk 'em what for an hour a day so you can do this [sigh] 

486.93 499.20 B: if you do it all day long go get ten [mn] at e- eight o'clock and go get ten more at ten o'clock and ten more at twelve [sigh] you could do that if you got a d- dollar [sigh] a piece a day 

493.37 494.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-hum )) 

499.23 499.99 A: right 

499.51 503.32 B: [mn] shoot you could end up making a hundred dollars a day [sigh] 

503.60 507.83 B: probably it's more than a dollar for an h- hour i bet they charge 

506.51 511.67 A: mm mm i don't think it's worth the risk of being bitten by a dog though [sigh] [laughter] 

509.62 516.30 B: no but look if you have [noise] ten dogs and you're charging ten dollars an hour that's a hundred dollars an hour if you've got ten dogs [sigh] 

516.11 523.14 A: yeah that is really good a- actually [laughter] maybe it is maybe it is worth it you know [noise] 

517.79 520.42 B: if you think about it [laughter] 

520.49 526.54 B: maybe maybe you need to check into that a little bit [laughter] 

523.68 525.25 A: [laughter] 

525.39 534.53 A: [sigh] wow my friend was ah so tired of it she didn't want to do it anymore so i guess i i had a bad impression of it [laughter] but maybe it's because she had done it so long 

531.78 533.37 B: yeah 

534.55 538.08 B: [mn] well maybe he got bit and he decided it wasn't worth it 

538.18 544.40 A: [laughter] [sigh] [laughter] so your dogs do that too wi- they get along with each other because they know each other but with strangers 

542.52 548.13 B: [mn] so a hundred oh yeah because they've been together forever but you bring another dog down here 

545.87 546.61 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

547.97 561.47 B: [sigh] and a at one time ah one of my neighbors came over and he has his dog in his truck [sigh] and he couldn't let his dog out [sigh] because mm him and my d- dog would have just absolutely torn each other to pieces [sigh] 

561.03 561.83 A: (( mm )) 

561.32 568.20 B: they just [mn] they're protecting their own territory my dog's protecting his place here [mn] and his dogs protecting that truck 

566.44 567.22 A: (( yeah mm )) 

568.40 572.87 B: [sigh] so we we [noise] had to really be careful and not let his dog get out 

573.54 576.64 B: [mn] 'cause it just wouldn't work [noise] it just wouldn't work at all 

577.02 580.80 B: [mn] but [noise] now he my dog can walk around the neighborhood 

581.25 593.31 B: [noise] and the other dogs are in their yard he gets along with fine because he knows 'em it's like neighbors you know they go visit [sigh] but someone comes up that they don't know [sigh] it's a whole different story 

587.82 589.04 A: right 

589.06 590.12 A: (( uh-hum )) 

593.19 594.86 A: yeah i'm sure [laughter] 

594.16 597.05 B: [mn] i'm sure after a while they could get acquainted 

597.29 599.89 B: [sigh] but u- usually you have to do that when they're young
