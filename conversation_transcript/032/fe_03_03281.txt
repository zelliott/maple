143.73 155.11 A: thirty s- seventy it it's gotta be fifty fifty give and take on both sides [noise] and i think if you can do that you're gonna have you know a long lasting relationship 

155.20 156.81 B: yeah i like it

166.40 169.07 B: you really have to marry your best friend 

169.46 180.65 B: you know what i'm saying y- y- and if you are marrying your best friend then you are going to have a fifty fifty relationship and work hard at coming to compromises and 

170.78 171.67 A: sure 

180.92 183.92 B: communication open communication 

184.54 192.81 B: i think it's y- you know i really believe if we treated our f- our families as well as we treat our friends

338.68 347.09 B: interacting with people i'm not sure what the research is really looking for ah it seems to me it's linguistic so you know what 

347.19 351.11 B: i i i don't know i- i'd be interested to find out 

350.07 351.59 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

351.28 352.51 B: but i don't know 

351.85 357.61 A: [noise] well i i think absolutely where you live has something to do with your ah 

358.45 360.40 A: ah the quality of your life and 

360.97 362.96 A: (( and your relationship )) 

362.29 367.44 B: well yeah i'll tell in maine there are it's so rural here

365.37 370.88 A: that yeah well it is here too pretty much but yet 

367.51 368.39 B: that 

371.02 372.06 A: within ah 

372.45 375.81 A: fifteen twenty minutes you can be in cosmopolitan 

376.08 379.28 A: ah in oklahoma city which is pretty modern 

378.28 379.64 B: o- oh 

379.64 380.72 A: very modern 

380.76 387.07 B: well very much different you know because [mn] there's no opportunity for meeting people here 

387.17 391.76 B: um or very little opportunity for meeting new people here 

387.25 388.16 A: (( [noise] right )) 

391.48 393.61 A: [noise] yeah i can do without that 

393.01 396.41 B: n- yeah well we can too except if if you're 

394.84 397.92 A: i've had enough i've had enough of that in my day i mean 

397.19 402.37 B: if you're if you're wife shopping or husband shopping it would make it difficult you know 

401.51 403.79 A: well it would yeah yeah [noise] 

402.69 408.77 B: yeah because everybody knows everybody and everybody knows everybody else's business and i think 

407.98 408.92 A: but then [noise] 

409.46 412.43 A: but then there's the internet to take care of that 

411.89 421.80 B: yeah right [laughter] if you're bold enough to set yourself up for getting in into all kinds of trouble you know [laughter] yeah [laughter] [mn] 

418.93 420.88 A: well you could do that too 

421.74 425.63 A: you can do that any anyhow you know anyway you want really 

423.85 428.16 B: that's exactly right exactly right that's a very 

427.22 431.50 A: but i think if you have the right partner you're not you're not gonna be looking 

432.65 445.31 A: and ah and ah each each one is going to understand the other as far as their needs and and i think that's the key i think i think that's compatibility and like you said friendship that's 

438.51 439.51 B: yeah 

439.73 440.88 B: i think that 

442.08 443.15 B: (( how do you think )) 

445.46 447.81 B: yeah i was going to ask you 

445.59 448.70 A: that's probably more important than anything else 

448.94 459.28 B: h- how do you make sure that you don't grow apart i mean you've been much longer than i have and i see a lot of people growing in different directions you know what i'm saying [mn] 

454.11 455.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

455.65 457.36 A: (( [noise] )) 

458.74 460.49 A: [noise] well i 

460.82 465.28 A: i think everybody does to an extent it's just ah 

466.24 468.70 A: you have to put a put a hold on it 

468.68 469.66 B: yeah 

468.72 473.35 A: (( you know [noise] i have i think you have to have some common interests [noise] obviously )) 

473.62 486.60 A: or you will grow apart [noise] and you know there's so much more to a marriage [noise] then just the physical aspect of it [noise] sex is probably only ten fifteen percent of a marriage really 

475.04 475.96 B: right 

486.29 489.56 B: yeah that's exactly right for us yeah 

487.95 489.23 A: [noise] 

489.42 491.98 A: communication is fifty [noise] 

491.61 492.44 B: yeah 

492.67 493.75 A: i would say 

494.26 495.04 B: (( yeah )) 

494.84 503.67 A: um [noise] compatibility is [noise] you know right up there too and and you hit the nail on the head when you when you started it started this conversation you said you got 

503.78 507.16 A: (( you gotta have a friend first [noise] and that's true )) 

505.75 506.74 B: yeah 

507.37 511.08 A: and then you gotta you gotta maintain that friendship throughout the relationship 

510.77 512.33 B: and that takes work 

512.03 516.67 A: (( as i as well as all as well as all the other aspects of the relationship you know )) 

516.64 517.45 B: yeah 

517.20 522.37 A: and marriage is a multi faceted institution there's no question about that 

521.69 522.74 B: yeah 

523.27 534.76 B: it sure does take it does take work and i and i don't think most young people realize that you gotta you gotta work if you want a a meaningful lasting relationship with anyone 

529.81 531.52 A: (( [noise] )) 

533.35 535.01 A: [noise]
