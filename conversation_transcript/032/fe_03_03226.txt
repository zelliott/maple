15.04 16.01 A: yeah 

15.99 18.16 B: what kind of cats do you have 

18.24 23.93 A: they're just kind of stray cats i adopted 'em when i first moved to new york at a um [mn] 

24.41 25.49 A: just like a 

25.71 31.40 A: a regular place where you adopt pets i don't even remember it's been so long [sigh] um 

30.33 31.54 B: oh 

31.56 33.28 B: like a shelter 

33.23 37.02 A: exactly but it's one of those ones they don't put down animals 

37.53 43.17 A: [mn] so i felt a little better about going there than [noise] a place that actually kills animals after a few days 

43.09 44.56 B: [sigh] oh 

44.67 46.16 A: have you ever had a pet 

46.71 48.93 B: oh yes i have [noise]

53.26 54.33 B: um 

54.84 55.90 B: i've had 

56.39 67.52 B: i've had three dogs i've had a boxer i've had just a r- regular [sigh] mutt a the cat was just a stray cat that just took up [sigh] at at our h- house 

67.41 68.54 A: (( uh-hum )) 

67.92 70.64 B: in mi- in miami years ago 

71.18 72.81 A: is that where you live now 

72.75 75.52 B: [sigh] no i moved to fort lauderdale 

75.82 84.64 A: [sigh] yeah i've had the two cats they're almost six years old and i got the one at the shelter and then when i went to go get him s- shots [sigh] 

84.72 95.70 A: i thought that he was lonely being at home all day while i worked so i got him another i got another cat so like they've grown up together and kind of think that they're brothers so [sigh] it works fairly well [mn] [sigh] 

94.47 95.20 B: (( [noise] [sigh] )) 

95.86 104.34 B: oh yeah [sigh] i was thinking about g- getting a pet we're not allowed pets where we live though [sigh] but i was thinking about a cat 

101.75 102.80 A: oh no 

104.33 106.94 A: yeah they're fun to have around you know 

107.01 108.81 A: [mn] i enjoy it and 

107.66 108.27 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

108.97 121.65 A: [sigh] i mean one of the things they said they wanted to know how much time and with the cat it's kind of hard because you can't take a cat [sigh] for a w- [laughter] walk or to the park or in the car per se you know they're fairly content at home and [sigh] living in new york 

122.18 128.92 A: wh- the place where i adopted them you have t- to sign a contract saying it's going to be indoor pets because there's just too many strays on the street [mn] [sigh] 

129.31 130.92 B: oh yeah 

130.60 140.30 A: but i mean pretty much what you know while we're home we'll play with them or they'll hang out with us while we're on the computer o- or making dinner or watching television so they always have lots of attention 

141.86 142.61 B: oh 

143.35 144.40 B: (( [sigh] well )) 

145.03 150.11 B: i had ah well like i say i had dogs before but i had a yard 

150.28 151.25 A: (( uh-hum )) 

150.33 152.48 B: (( a fenced in yard )) 

152.74 158.81 B: but my cat wa- my cat was not an inside cat he he was a outside cat 

159.11 162.15 A: [noise] yeah i think pretty much everywhere else [mn] um ah 

161.93 174.89 A: cats seem to be outside except in new york just because [sigh] if every cat owner's cat was out on the streets we would just have wild animals r- roaming [laughter] you know [sigh] all day and all night and it could get p- pretty bad 

175.07 176.12 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

176.25 182.06 B: [sigh] oh there's no there's no wi- there's no cats on the streets in in ah 

182.14 183.37 B: new york 

183.40 185.25 A: (( [sigh] [mn] not many you mi- )) 

183.73 185.82 B: oh in the city 

185.61 187.38 A: exactly yeah 

187.42 189.59 A: [mn] you don't really see 'em no 

189.65 192.13 A: [sigh] and dogs have to be on leashes so 

193.02 194.13 B: (( mm yeah )) 

193.86 196.41 A: [mn] it kind of keeps things more under control 

197.50 198.25 B: oh 

198.32 206.19 A: what was the other question they asked at the beginning of the phone call if you have pets how mu- how much time you spend with them and what was the third question [mn] 

207.15 208.19 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

208.20 210.27 B: you know i didn't hear that 

210.13 211.88 A: no i don't think i did either 

212.17 214.56 A: [sigh] they say it kind of quickly 

212.64 213.51 B: i did- 

214.24 224.28 B: yeah i didn't hear it [sigh] but ah i really e- enjoyed my pets but i had [sigh] i had pets when i had my kids [sigh] when they were little 

223.15 224.08 A: (( [laughter] uh-hum )) 

224.25 225.19 A: (( uh-hum )) 

225.11 235.97 B: and ah if i lived like out in the country i would like to have a s- some a a dog or a cat but [sigh] um well maybe a cat h- 

236.13 248.51 B: here because a cat if it was you know if it stayed inside but um i have lots of friends that have [sigh] that have cats and [sigh] pets 

249.81 254.06 B: [sigh] they're nice to have around but they're a lot of trouble if you go away 

254.22 255.64 A: yeah that's true 

256.24 264.70 A: [sigh] yeah right now it's a good situation i live with some friends [mn] so if i ever leave to go out of town they're nice enough to watch after the [sigh] pets while i'm gone 

256.43 257.01 B: (( [sigh] )) 

263.09 271.37 B: yeah otherwise you have if you don't have somebody to watch your pet then you have to [sigh] you have to put it in the vet's and its so expensive 

271.43 275.25 A: that and the animals usually get pretty upset if you do that [mn] you know [mn] 

275.78 276.82 B: yeah 

276.84 286.61 A: you always hear i've heard the horror stories where people move a lot or they leave their cats at the vet and then they come home and they like pee on their owner's bed for weeks because they're upset that they left 'em 

287.32 288.75 B: [lipsmack] oh really 

288.28 290.41 A: (( [laughter] y- y- yeah so [laughter] )) 

289.61 291.21 B: (( oh the cats )) 

290.90 291.87 A: yeah 

292.21 298.01 A: they're pretty sensitive more so than dogs i think 'cause cats [sigh] cats always know that you're going to come home 

298.03 300.51 A: or is it vice versa dogs don't 

300.94 303.08 A: i can't remember which way it works 

303.61 308.97 B: [sigh] [sigh] i don't know but it the cats know you're going to come home 

305.02 305.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

305.65 306.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

308.81 313.36 A: yeah and dogs don't and that's why dogs tend to be more loyal than cats 

314.39 319.71 B: [sigh] oh i don't know [sigh] ah my ge- my d- dog that i had ah [sigh] 

320.02 328.15 B: if i if i was going you know i used to hang my clothes on the clothesline [sigh] when my kids were little and and if i used to leave 

328.01 329.15 A: (( [mn] uh-hum )) 

328.09 336.49 B: to go to the store an- and put my [sigh] ah they were boxers and put 'em outside [sigh] they would take all the clothes off t- the clothesline 

336.50 339.04 A: oh [laughter] the dogs would what would they do with them 

339.07 342.61 B: they would just take 'em off but ah they wouldn't do that 

342.65 346.49 B: [sigh] not if they wouldn't do it unless i left 

346.36 347.28 A: ha 

348.35 353.82 B: it was like they they was just being you know being ah 

354.00 357.54 B: [sigh] mischievous or mad because i was leaving 

357.66 367.30 A: yeah [sigh] dogs tend to like their owner's s- smells too i know i remember growing up our dogs would always like try to steal our t-shirts and sleep on 'em 

367.57 369.92 A: [sigh] so maybe it was something like that 

370.30 371.45 B: (( [sigh] oh )) 

371.80 378.51 B: oh i don't i don't know i but it seemed to only happen when i left [sigh] but ah 

376.73 377.86 A: right 

379.06 390.36 B: [sigh] but i know my friend she has a cat and [sigh] the cat is older but when she goes away for a long time [mn] the cat will will ah go on the floor 

390.48 391.36 A: (( [sigh] o- o- oof )) 

391.75 393.25 B: for no reason 

392.01 393.73 A: yeah 'cause like a pest

394.11 395.73 A: the cats get mad 

396.05 398.87 B: yeah they d- they e- evidently they do 

399.39 405.61 B: [sigh] but she said she thought it was because the cat was getting old [sigh] but i don't think so because [sigh] 

405.62 411.01 B: ah the cat i watched her cat you know while she want to north carolina for a week 

410.81 411.81 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum ))

433.92 446.98 A: no my cats are pretty good they don't s- seem to get upset if i leave i mean i've never left 'em more than a couple of weeks at a time and [sigh] they're fairly adapted here you know they're comfortable they get to r- roam the house except at night 

446.82 452.41 A: i don't want 'em come in the bedroom which they're not too happy about but i mean no they've never like p- 

452.73 458.71 A: peed in front of my door or on my bed or anything they're very [sigh] because they're both males and they've been um [mn] 

458.87 469.26 A: n- neutered [sigh] they're both just v- very friendly cats like they'll come sit in your lap and hang out with you and [sigh] they they're not gonna bite or scratch or

488.58 492.44 B: but but everybody has cats they just keep 'em inside 

492.43 503.63 A: right they probably don't want 'em [mn] they think they're going to ruin the carpet but they really cats can't really ruin anything [sigh] and if they do they're going to scratch your furniture not anything that's already in the apartment itself you know 

503.98 505.02 B: yes 

505.06 508.48 B: [sigh] but does your cats do they have claws 

505.13 507.03 A: it's kind of a strange rule 

508.03 508.99 A: they do 

509.18 509.74 A: (( [sigh] )) 

510.28 515.50 A: but they have a scratching post and they use that they they've never ruined any of the furniture

521.18 523.00 B: some people ah they 

523.43 527.75 B: [mn] they declaw the front claws not the back claws 

527.39 528.62 A: right 

529.26 541.36 A: [mn] i guess it just kind of depends what cat you get you know for humane reasons i'd rather not take any claws out of my cats because i hear it's pretty painful [sigh] but then you know if you love your cat and t- the cat's a little crazy and it's gonna ruin [sigh] 

541.20 546.00 A: your couch that you spent a few thousand dollars on then it might be something to consider you know [sigh] [sigh] 

546.15 547.68 B: yes it might 

547.88 552.60 A: so i kind of have mixed emotions towards that but it's just i guess situational 

554.04 564.42 B: yes [sigh] but a- also when my when my i don't know about cats but when my dogs were [sigh] ah i remember i had b- boxers and they were pedigrees [sigh]

571.54 573.68 B: you name it they had it 

573.71 577.98 A: was it typical for boxers [mn] to h- have those kind of problems 

573.86 575.20 B: and then i had 

578.28 583.40 B: well they were pedigrees sometimes pedigree well [sigh] 

584.11 590.64 B: i never had any other kind of dogs but boxers you know what they look like they got the long tongue [mn] 

587.50 588.61 A: (( uh-hum ))
