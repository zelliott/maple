436.10 437.51 B: i feel 

437.71 441.77 B: i feel the man should give a little more than the woman 

442.50 444.62 B: 'cause women are very sensitive 

444.66 446.14 A: right 

445.51 454.16 B: and i think i mean you know i believe in sharing my feelings but i think i like a doting man

507.42 508.38 B: okay 

511.97 517.93 A: it's probably best for a giver to be in a relationship with another giver and not a taker 'cause take-
