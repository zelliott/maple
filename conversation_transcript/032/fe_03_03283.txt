23.99 34.97 A: [sigh] i don't know th- they have to share the same interests as me but also have um similar values um if if ah for example if my life if a person i was dating 

35.02 42.16 A: ah wasn't interested in languages at all they'd probably get pretty bored when i get ah grossly involved in [sigh] you know 

42.45 53.16 A: a a new language or or something that i'm studying but if they didn't have the same value as me i've i've also met people who you know may be interested in the same things but say they don't like children for example or they don't 

45.35 46.21 B: mhm 

53.26 59.01 A: they're not kind people i i don't think i could stay around them for a long period of time 

58.03 68.25 B: right right [lipsmack] it's important that people that you share the same things because then you know after a while you don't have anything to talk about or you know somebody who 

68.32 77.10 B: somebody has to be also committed to what or at least if not committed to you but kind of committed to what you're committed to if they don't respect [sigh] say if you have a commitment to 

76.87 84.48 B: [mn] i'm gonna learn new languages and somebody doesn't respect that even though they may love you that's not gonna work out [sigh] so it's important 

84.62 86.68 B: right to have shared interests in 

84.65 86.47 A: yeah 

87.59 88.58 B: (( things like )) 

87.80 91.55 A: i don't know i- it's interesting because um when i was in russia 

91.50 99.99 A: um the the host family i was staying it was all women but th- um they used to ask me sometimes you know they they'd ask me about the girls i'm dating and one time 

99.75 100.43 B: (( mhm )) 

99.91 104.22 A: um the mother she asked me you know like w- what do you uh look for 

104.02 116.02 A: in a in a girl you're dating and and i said you know the usual things meaning like you know intelligent funny attractive you know the things like oh yeah yeah we know like you know good cook good [mn] cleaning you know [laughter] all that kind of stuff 

115.65 116.60 B: [laughter] 

116.23 120.90 A: [laughter] [laughter] so i guess it also d- has a little bit to do with you know [mn] 

120.94 125.04 A: the kind of culture you're brought up in if you're part of a more eastern or you know 

125.08 126.08 B: (( oh yeah )) 

125.30 134.53 A: old school culture than maybe you're you're looking for the practical aspects of a life partner rather than you know a sort of western romantic ideal you know 

133.58 142.03 B: yeah and i've found over the years that that the things that is like my standards ten years ago were completely different [laughter] than they are now 

142.40 144.03 B: completely different 

142.61 145.16 A: wh- what were your standards ten years ago 

145.24 148.75 B: like well ten years i just say i was in a different place 

149.17 155.65 B: [lipsmack] that i wasn't looking for like any kind of long term commitment or anything so all he had to do was be reasonably attractive and 

155.85 169.57 B: just kind of trustworthy you know but now he has to have you know a good job he has to have goals [laughter] you know things like that that are that'll you know last a long time because people don't look the same you know over forty fifty years you gon everybody's gonna be old and 

169.52 173.37 B: not so attractive so you have to have way more qualities than [noise] 

173.41 175.61 B: than you do when like you're younger 

176.20 177.34 B: (( and just you know )) 

177.73 179.54 B: kind of dating casually 

179.51 188.21 A: yeah well i mean i guess when i was in school i used to think ah money that doesn't m- make any difference or a job because e- everybody is you know we're all just students but 

188.00 199.77 A: i mean those kind of things i used to think well i mean if somebody's interested in money then they're really shallow but you also gotta take into account if someone's not really going forward in their life you know like i you know i had some friends that 

199.60 203.96 A: they'd be dating you know an artist or a musician or something who really didn't i mean 

203.96 216.62 A: he he may be a really gifted person but i mean you can see their lives are just sort of slipping [laughter] and and ah you know ten years from now i mean i mean they they may be in a really you know bad situation you know i mean 

213.70 215.39 B: that's right that's right 

215.75 220.85 B: and if you pick people with good jobs i mean they might not wanna to h- keep those good jobs for a long time [laughter] 

220.31 221.70 A: yeah like 

221.03 228.98 B: or you know people with good jobs have to work a lot and equal- and everybody says oh i want a doctor or whatever but doctors work a lot [laughter] [sigh] mm 

223.75 225.47 A: yeah 

228.80 232.53 A: yeah i i guess i used to be embarrassed you know 

232.41 236.93 A: if i didn't [mn] i mean especially right after i i graduated because i 

236.87 250.07 A: i didn't have a good job and i felt like well i w- i w- if i was a girl i wouldn't wanna er date a guy who didn't seem to have his life together you know who had have his goals set and and you know he didn't really have anywhere to go because in 

250.55 256.77 A: who who is he going to be in a couple of years but [sigh] i don't know th- things have changed a lot for me recently i mean 

256.54 265.74 A: i just i just got a a pretty good job and i feel like i'm back on the right track so that i i would be the right candidate for a you know 

265.90 272.75 A: [sigh] a life partner for someone else you know 'cause i'm i'm doing what i need to be doing and i feel very confident about myself now so 

267.90 268.89 B: yeah 

272.11 275.14 B: yeah a lot of people don't realize that either that you have to 

275.31 278.31 B: you have to personify the quality that you want in somebody else so a 

278.24 292.22 B: lot of people say oh you know i want somebody with like a good job [mn] but you know they don't have a good job [laughter] if you don't have you can't offer that yourself but if you all you have to do i mean i've seen lots of people after graduation and it it's kinda hard to start out 

292.33 298.86 B: and some people i think also don't realize that either that just like where you are right now is not necessarily an indication of where you'll be 

299.34 307.69 B: in um you know in the future and if you have goals and a plan that's i mean almost better than just 

308.08 311.38 B: you know stumbling upon lots and lots of money 

311.60 317.70 A: yeah yeah [mn] i i guess like i i'm i'm more interested in finding someone who 

318.06 328.80 A: shows a really dynamic mind you know i feel like some people like i don't know th they may be kind of stable right now but ah other people have a vision to kind of go beyond you know 

328.50 329.52 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

328.71 340.86 A: [sigh] and ah tho- those are the kind of people that i'm more attracted to people people who think outside the box you know and [sigh] and could broaden their horizons someone who'd be willing to travel because travel is really important to me and so 

340.91 344.04 A: a girl who who is kind of you know 

344.28 349.14 A: narrow minded in in what what you know she was going to be doing in the next couple of years 

349.24 353.47 A: probably wouldn't suit me as well as someone who had an idea of like you know [sigh] 

353.79 359.58 A: expanding her career opportunities traveling you know developing her career in different directions you know 

359.08 360.16 B: that's for sure 

359.84 363.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

363.49 364.67 B: are you at work 

364.52 378.07 A: [noise] ah no actually i'm lying at home in bed right now oh shit there's a someone's calling me on the other line i'll just i'll just press end on that i'll call them back but yeah i just i just had a surgery yesterday so 

368.11 370.25 B: (( oh [laughter] oh sure [laughter] [noise] oh okay [noise] )) 

378.40 380.97 A: i'm just kinda lying in bed [sigh] 

381.17 382.30 A: (( thought might be )) 

382.76 385.33 A: i'll be fine just to do one of these conversations 

385.04 389.45 B: yeah it's very it's very interesting i mean just to hear what other people think like you know i guess 

389.46 390.85 B: life partners 

391.52 397.17 B: see i mean i don't know who you are but i guess it's pretty standard for people across 

397.86 404.55 B: the world or let's say progressive people [laughter] people who care about good things [laughter] you know across mhm 

400.62 401.57 A: [laughter] 

403.21 414.09 A: well i mean like i mean my dad's culture my dad was indian and and i don't know like for example my uncle he went to india and ah put out an ad for a wife went around and interviewed a couple of women and then 

414.14 422.24 A: and then one of them he picked and then he came back to america with her you know married her because for them it's more like a almost like a business decision [laughter] 

422.28 430.49 A: [laughter] we're gonna we're gonna pick someone practical or like you know ev- before that it was like families picked your parents might just decide for you who you were going to marry you don't 

430.12 432.40 B: oh yeah 

431.71 445.40 A: yeah i mean not not too many people do it exactly like that but there's very few marriages in india that are like the way we do it where we date someone and maybe live with them for a while before we get married because they just don't do that you know and 

439.96 440.90 B: right 

443.93 446.57 B: and yet that don't get divorced nearly as much 

446.22 453.78 A: yeah well i mean it's a hard question to answer that one i mean is it because they they can't get divorced or because they don't wanna get divorced i mean 

453.91 463.11 A: uh i mean in america i think we we sort of we get married real quickly but we also know that we have that option of leaving whereas in india i don't think it's really i mean 

460.40 461.59 B: right right 

463.62 471.03 A: ah i think it would be kinda hard to go up to your parents and say like yeah i'm i'm getting divorced from my wife you know i mean it's just it's not something you do you know 

470.24 471.39 B: (( mhm mhm right )) 

471.26 479.03 A: but i mean do they love each other i don't know i've i've seen couples that i think do love each other they've been together you know twenty twenty five years but also 

478.94 493.34 A: their relations- i don't i don't feel like the the relationships that most indian couples have are the kind of ones like they don't seem as intimately connected as i wanna be to my wife i'm not saying that all americans are either but you know [sigh] i don't 

494.76 497.88 B: right [lipsmack] yeah i was thinking that like um 

498.02 507.08 B: you know earlier in the last you know say fifty years people used to not get divorced but is it that they just marriages were better or just people were miserable in their marriages 

507.51 508.42 A: (( know )) 

507.52 509.08 B: (( i wonder [lipsmack] [noise] )) 

508.95 515.17 A: i i mean i think like in high school kids should probably be counseled on certain things because you know 

515.31 521.97 A: most kids getting out of high school don't know how to manage their personal finances and and people you know people get married around like twenty or twenty one 

522.05 530.31 A: like d- i don't think most of them have any idea what it takes to raise a family [laughter] or make a marriage work or anything like that so if if they had some sort of [noise] 

530.29 540.07 A: [mn] at least some basic education for kids on on where the kind of pressures they're gonna face it might it might help people to understand a little bit before they jump into something like that you know 

539.51 541.29 B: they need that for adults too 

541.14 545.51 A: yeah yeah [laughter] exactly i mean maybe maybe when something like you know when 

545.33 550.46 A: you know like you take defensive driving if you get a a speeding ticket or something you know so if you're if you're 

548.87 549.72 B: (( yeah )) 

550.44 560.96 A: were gonna get a marriage licence maybe you have to complete some one hour basic education course or something like that on like these are the common problems that married couples have faced over the past hundred years or something you know [mn] 

553.54 554.49 B: [laughter] 

555.04 555.85 B: yeah 

560.58 569.75 B: yeah it is because i mean if you look at if you look at like t._v. or whatever you think that marriage is all terrific and it's not well not all the time maybe say that [mn] [sigh] 

561.55 563.14 A: (( right )) 

569.15 572.48 A: yeah well maybe you don't you don't see the day to day i mean 

572.30 586.17 A: i guess y- you see it with your parents like how they fight but i don't know every every relationship is going to be different so i mean i i know the things that my parents did that i don't want to do when i get married but i also don't know all the other problems that i could be facing when i 

586.53 588.09 A: meet someone you know 

588.19 588.75 A: (( [sigh] )) 

589.40 591.77 B: (( yeah yeah i understand )) 

594.28 599.89 B: [mn] understand so what's important i i think to have like a life long partner who who realizes that also that
