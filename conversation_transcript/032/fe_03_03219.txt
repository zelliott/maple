23.66 27.70 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] and i have [noise] i m- i )) 

28.42 30.11 B: i m- miss them kind of 

30.88 32.86 A: why don't you have pets now 

32.83 47.12 B: [mn] [sigh] um [noise] yeah i i gave i i guess i'd given well the cats i kind of lost through [sigh] i guess i've lost them all through moving situations [sigh] and um a- um [mn] the the um 

42.76 43.57 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

47.08 55.58 B: the bird i i realized i had moved into a smaller place and there was really [sigh] the the there was really sort of no way for both 

55.34 56.81 B: for me to you know 

56.64 59.37 B: give the bird enough time out of the cage [sigh] 

59.21 72.85 B: and it would be cruel to keep him and i i thought of somebody who you know i sort of pictured their apartment and the bird and i thought it would yeah have a nice sort of life there [sigh] [sigh] the cats i i kind of lost more sadly actually ah one of them died and 

67.93 68.94 A: yeah 

72.69 73.47 A: (( oh )) 

74.85 89.68 B: and um [lipsmack] ah and when i when and i thought about replacing them but then the bird sort of came into my life and after that people kept offering me cats i said well cats and birds don't get along very well and then i i had to move to this smaller place and i couldn't have dealt with any of them [sigh] what's y- your 

89.56 90.78 B: pet history 

89.85 94.06 A: [laughter] a- um well um [lipsmack] 

94.73 97.74 A: i've had cats always growing up 

98.01 99.26 A: and um 

99.56 109.42 A: [lipsmack] had a dog when i was much younger but i don't re- remember that so much so i really only have l- lived with cats but um 

109.53 114.26 A: [sigh] the reason i don't have a- any now is um [mn] 

115.11 121.61 A: because i'm a s- student [mn] so i'm kind of itinerant and i never stay in one place for 

121.68 136.37 A: long um i'm studying anthropology so [sigh] i'm always gone in th- the summers and [mn] um so it's not a good situation to own a pet because [noise] you need to be a have a more stable life style but um 

136.58 138.41 A: [lipsmack] when i did 

138.81 140.44 A: have cats 

140.76 143.41 A: in the past or when i lived with them 

143.92 145.80 A: [lipsmack] i [sigh] 

146.31 147.34 A: um 

148.55 150.09 A: i spent [sigh] 

150.40 157.58 A: i spent a lot of time with them beca- when they would come to me [laughter] but i didn't re- um 

158.02 160.14 A: seek them out very much 

160.00 169.36 B: [noise] [noise] [mn] that's the way i behaved with cats also [sigh] and it it seemed ah ah that's why i i never grew up with pets my f- family i i live in new york city where do you live 

160.31 161.26 A: (( ah [noise] )) 

169.35 171.32 A: [noise] um in philadelphia 

169.79 170.38 B: (( [sigh] )) 

171.23 183.69 B: [cough] oh i i've been there [laughter] it's not so far [sigh] but um the the the i i grew up with this idea of my parents which i think was probably [mn] ah 

172.86 174.06 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

184.00 197.34 B: probably an excuse but they said well you know we live in a c- city apartment and there's no room for pets [sigh] and it turned out more truthfully i think my mother was kind of afraid of wild animals is the truth because as children growing up i have a younger brother and [sigh] you know h- at 

197.29 207.14 B: various points we'd both each asked for pets and i once came back from summer camp like with a salamander [sigh] and my m- mother you know like arranged to ah ah 

203.12 204.21 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [mn] )) 

207.59 219.99 B: [sigh] somehow neglect it ah ah somehow when i came home from school one day the salamander had escaped [sigh] and and my brother came back from some situation with a turtle once and [sigh] some [laughter] somehow my mother 

218.46 219.64 A: [laughter] 

219.91 233.50 B: ended up flushing it down the toilet i think that the idea of other living things in the house was too appalling [sigh] and so the there was the but but her cover story was that you know city people can't really deal with with you know wild life [sigh] and um 

221.94 223.75 A: (( [noise] oh really [laughter] [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

233.60 248.04 B: ah and then when i moved out of that house many many years ago i i ah i ah i thought you know well i really would like to have a pet and the cat was the most independent you don't have to come to it it it does come to you when it feels like it as you were saying [sigh] [noise] 

246.07 247.26 A: yeah 

247.53 255.15 A: and if you try i i guess that's like c- cat owners confuse it 'cause if you try to [sigh] um 

255.89 267.27 A: go after the cat and h- hold it or pet it and it's not interested then it [laughter] then it it's not gonna respond always and [mn] um 

267.68 270.26 A: yeah it's they're moody [laughter] [sigh] 

270.59 276.71 B: [noise] [sigh] yeah i guess they also take on you know the the let's be frank they take on some of the characteristics of their 

277.47 279.29 B: ah t- the people they live with don't they 

280.33 285.03 A: i don't know i mean i guess they people say that and 

284.87 286.15 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] i'd )) 

285.47 286.43 A: um 

286.27 299.23 B: i found one i'm having one c- cat memory i mean this topic is a little sudden i didn't know that's what we were going to be talking about [sigh] but one cat memory is coming to me is a cat that um [sigh] that would take on my own food habit at that time [sigh] i 

298.59 300.09 A: (( [laughter] really [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

299.01 308.01 B: i i i don't know why i was i was i was very fond of r- raw string beans [sigh] and i thought this is hardly cat food [sigh] but the cat ah 

307.84 320.96 B: become fascinated by raw string beans and i found even like g- going out to ah [sigh] leave the house in the morning when you must have had this experience now and then when you leave and a cat wants to leave [sigh] and um and if you're in philadelphia you're in a city too 

317.53 318.62 A: yeah yeah 

320.95 324.47 B: [laughter] and i mean i've been to philadelphia [sigh] and ah um 

321.21 322.15 A: yeah 

324.37 337.13 B: [sigh] and then the cat would start running out the door [sigh] and the way that i found to tr- train it to stay in was that i would throw this raw string bean across the room and it would go running after the raw string bean it seemed to be more attracted to it than me [sigh] and um 

334.06 335.63 A: [laughter] 

335.75 337.28 A: [laughter] 

336.93 343.49 B: i thought this is really strange but somehow it's picked up that you know that i liked raw string beans i guess raw string beans were good 

343.24 344.03 A: huh 

344.24 351.10 A: that's interesting yeah ah my cat had the strange habit [sigh] that i think developed from living 

344.28 344.84 B: (( [sigh] )) 

351.12 355.32 A: ah with with me or [mn] um [lipsmack] 

355.31 368.05 A: because it's the only cat i know of that will like if when i when i go to the bathroom it e- especially in the morning the cat will come with me [sigh] and jump up on the counter and d- drink out of the faucet 

367.90 368.75 B: huh 

368.46 375.00 A: and this happened every every day and it it's like she learned the routine and that's and 

376.24 385.43 A: that's how she [noise] [sigh] she learned how to drink w- water but the but it's only [mn] at certain times of the day and usually she also has a water bowl and usually she'll 

385.71 389.16 A: most times of the day she'll drink out of the water bowl but 

389.19 395.15 A: [lipsmack] something about the morning routine she picks up on and [sigh] and makes it part of her routine too 

395.15 396.94 B: and that you're both involved with 

397.00 399.27 B: some sort of liquid substance 

398.82 403.02 A: (( [laughter] y- yeah [laughter] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

399.64 400.69 B: [laughter] 

402.67 413.99 B: [sigh] and ah um [mn] so you had dogs now this household where that i grew up in where there were no pets [sigh] my younger brother now who no longer lives in a city [sigh] ah 

413.75 425.81 B: he ah has resisted having pets until he's quite grown up now [sigh] and um and he he has for the first time in his life my brother is now fifty o- one 

426.04 433.05 B: fifty three [sigh] and for the first time in his life he's living with a dog [sigh] and he's it's taken him 

433.09 437.36 B: about [sigh] four months he said to actually l- like it 

437.41 438.52 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

437.59 438.32 A: hm 

438.90 445.10 B: ah and of course the rest of the family is very pleased because they begged him for it for quite a long time [noise] [laughter] 

445.11 446.73 A: [laughter] [noise] 

447.44 448.40 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

448.57 453.98 B: but i i somehow but i i don't know if i could ever imagine you know living with something as um um 

454.56 458.95 B: [lipsmack] as d- demanding as a dog and yet they say it's real good for you 

460.50 462.10 A: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] yeah [sigh] )) 

460.80 461.79 B: (( [sigh] they say [mn] [sigh] )) 

463.67 467.75 A: we- well i don't know that would be it seems like it seems like it would 

467.89 472.68 A: [sigh] since the most different re- relationship too [sigh] 

473.08 474.54 A: with a dog 

475.31 476.29 A: um 

476.78 479.61 A: it seems like it's more of a relationship like a 

479.78 484.49 A: cat is sort of a c- casual [laughter] kind of 

484.95 487.44 A: relationship that develops but 

487.79 488.71 B: yeah 

487.83 489.84 A: a dog would be more of a 

490.56 494.03 A: steady or um devoted in a way [mn] 

494.01 498.05 B: [sigh] yeah the dogs really seem to to d- demand intimacy 

497.97 499.20 A: yeah 

500.93 507.45 B: (( a- and um [sigh] you know i i i guess i'm really suspicious of people who get very involved with their dogs that there's there's the 'cause they )) 

507.75 517.03 B: (( i don't know i'm not sure i want to really generalize about pet owners but ah that [sigh] do they learn some kind of you know demand for intimacy from um people )) 

517.74 532.25 B: who may not want to offer it in response but [sigh] the other interesting question the degree to which we train our animals maybe to eat the same foods as we do or to [sigh] [laughter] or to drink while we urinate [sigh] but th- there are ways i think in which our our pets train us 

532.66 547.33 B: [sigh] and um um it it's sort of vague to me and having you know not been currently involved with pets and not having those early pet experiences which [sigh] you know mark you for life i guess you know people write stories about them make movies about them [sigh] 

546.86 548.12 A: (( [laughter] uh-hum )) 

547.96 549.72 B: (( and um um )) 

549.81 554.89 B: the people who are running this program maybe really surprised to hear a conversation between two not pet owners 

554.79 556.98 A: (( [laughter] no [laughter] [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

557.26 558.54 B: (( and um )) 

560.09 575.06 B: [lipsmack] ah it makes you feel to like you want to [laughter] r- run out and get do you get offered pets a lot [sigh] i mean that's another thing too i mean pets somehow always seem to be at least in new york they're always seem to be you know somebody's moving out of town and has to leave a pet behind somebody that there seem to be an awful lot of needy pets [sigh] i 

563.55 564.71 A: [laughter] 

572.70 573.83 A: yeah 

574.78 577.39 A: [sigh] yeah well my neighbors have [lipsmack] 

577.48 579.46 A: about [laughter] six cats [lipsmack] 

579.91 582.53 A: and it's a d- dual house so 

582.70 588.83 A: ah their pets are kind of our pets except they're outside and not in our house but um 

589.12 599.07 A: [mn] so ah i and i know their names and i when i see 'em and i talk to them and [noise] um it's nice to have 'em around um so it kind of [lipsmack]
