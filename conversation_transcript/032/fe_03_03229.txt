390.25 391.55 B: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

401.31 414.95 B: well when we put ranger outside unfortunately we have to stake him because [sigh] part of our fence has broken and until we can afford to replace that whole ah length of fence when we put him outside we have to stake him and i hate that

419.19 433.07 A: [sigh] which is kind of crazy but [sigh] um i wish we did [laughter] but i can never just let him go run around 'cause [sigh] he ran away on- once [laughter] [sigh] so [sigh] i don't know it was when we were visiting um 

427.65 428.69 B: (( yeah [noise] [sigh] )) 

433.23 436.02 A: my boyfriend at his [sigh] house 

435.85 450.69 A: when he used to a house that th the dog actually used to live at and they always used to go out and use the restroom in the front yard and [sigh] come right back in it was never a problem [sigh] well one day i guess something caught his attention and he was gone [sigh] like gone [laughter] 

450.25 457.26 B: [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] ranger has gotten out of the backyard several times this is how we discovered that the fence was broken [sigh] [sigh] um [cough] 

450.52 451.30 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

455.39 456.41 A: (( uh-hum )) 

457.21 470.17 B: he kept getting out of the out of the backyard and he he'd come up to the front door and [laughter] scratch and i'd sit there and i i had no clue that he was loose so like what the hell was that noise at the door [laughter] like open up [laughter] yeah 

466.62 467.55 A: yeah 

467.95 475.15 A: well even my mom's dog like if she gets out of the backyard [sigh] she just walks around right to the front door it's like let me in [laughter] [laughter] 

473.94 475.92 B: yeah that's what he was doing [sigh] 

475.70 489.64 B: and i finally got we start- finally figured my husband went back there poor thing in all the v- vines and [sigh] we have a l- large backyard and back in the back corner is where he was getting out [sigh] he was going through the neighbor's yard and coming out their ah 

480.43 481.14 A: uh-huh 

486.34 487.24 A: yeah 

489.62 504.55 B: coming out their open gate 'cause they have one of those gates that that just kind of s- swings back and forth [sigh] [sigh] and ah [laughter] [sigh] he had to go back there and crawl through all this brush which is now gone [laughter] to fi- to find out that part of our fence was busted [mn] 

490.92 491.79 A: (( uh-hum )) 

494.90 495.70 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

504.01 505.08 A: oh goodness 

505.04 506.01 B: so 

505.81 506.52 A: (( mm )) 

506.22 511.30 B: hopefully one day we'll have that fixed and we'll have a [sigh] happier dog when he goes outside 

510.68 519.11 A: yeah sure [sigh] i don't i don't know how much my dog likes being outside sometimes i think he likes to stay out there all the time and then other times [mn] like 

512.39 513.65 B: (( but [noise] [noise] uh-hum [sigh] )) 

518.88 530.49 A: we walk him like when he goes outside we [sigh] you know we have him on the leash [sigh] and other times he goes out there and does his business and comes right back inside like he doesn't want to have anything to do with staying out there [laughter] 

529.46 535.43 B: ranger goes through phases either he wants to be outside all the time or he wants to be inside all the time for a while 

533.82 534.74 A: yeah 

534.82 541.32 A: we let him out on our balcony and sometimes he'll just like l- lay there but if he goes out to the bathroom he just wants to just come right back in 

540.78 542.14 B: (( [noise] [laughter] [noise] [laughter] [sigh] )) 

541.55 553.59 A: and lay on the newspapers and [sigh] magazines right now he's lying on the floor with his head propped up on some magazines [noise] i don't understand it he lays on every p- piece of paper that is anywhere 

554.10 555.45 A: i don't understand it 

554.36 561.11 B: pet's do that they have to i think i think it's because they think [sigh] oh well they're going to have to read this eventually 

560.34 562.71 A: yeah [laughter] 

561.38 572.73 B: [sigh] if i if i have anything paper in my lap or in front of me the cat the cats especially [sigh] cats are notorious for laying on the newspaper while you're reading it and stuff like that [sigh] [sigh] yeah 

564.59 565.82 A: [laughter] 

570.17 571.08 A: uh-huh 

571.58 572.83 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

572.81 577.31 B: but you know dogs do it too i think it's because they know they're going to get your attention [noise] 

576.51 588.76 A: yeah or like i don't know if ma- maybe the paper from like maybe when he was a puppy [sigh] and like used to lay in a cage or the paper gets cooler especially it's starting to get warm outside now [laughter] 

587.89 591.04 B: [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] i hadn't thought about that 

589.09 592.15 A: and he lays on that because that's cooler [sigh] i don't know 

591.55 596.08 B: i just usually think [laughter] they're trying to get in the way so i have to pay attention to them [sigh] 

595.09 599.89 A: he's not like right now he's like lying in the middle of the floor there's like some magazines sitting in the middle of the
