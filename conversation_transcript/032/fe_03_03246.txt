0.12 2.69 A: hello i'm deborah 

0.76 1.93 B: hello 

2.21 3.63 B: hi i'm bill 

3.17 12.75 A: hi bill [laughter] um i gather the topic is business scandals and whether we think they've caused the ah economic problems that we 

11.82 18.65 B: yes and also what the government can do to poss- or if we think that the government can do anything to possibly prevent them 

18.06 20.79 A: right why don't you go first what do you think [laughter] 

20.49 27.43 B: um well one one of the parts also was you know how are we how have we been affected by the um 

27.31 28.25 A: right 

27.88 38.61 B: ah by the the government er corporate fraud mm the biggest um my biggest effect is that i live in california and um the 

36.11 37.19 A: mhm 

38.85 47.45 B: sky rocketing um electrical rates were just i mean just devastating to my state and as well as to my personal pocket book 

47.37 48.40 A: yeah 

47.66 55.04 B: so that was how i was affected by it how i think government can help ah prevent all of the fraud and so forth 

55.02 65.81 B: i'm not a firm believer in privatizing everything i think that um i think that when the government has some control over 

66.34 75.74 B: regulations and overseeing that then they could prevent some of the fraud that that occurs um 

69.79 70.83 A: mhm 

76.09 84.40 B: that's sort of one angle that because of the privatization of the electrical industry that was [sigh] 

79.56 80.46 A: mhm 

83.29 84.13 A: right 

86.24 88.05 A: [sigh] i i um 

88.80 90.25 A: i feel as though 

90.49 93.37 A: oh the t._v. came on let me turn it off um 

93.96 100.21 A: i guess i don't feel that i've noticed in our home any particular impact i'm in colorado and um 

100.50 105.92 A: [noise] i don't think that our well no our our our power rates went up but i don't know that i could directly 

106.08 108.69 A: um attribute that to any fraud 

108.44 109.69 B: mhm 

109.08 114.25 A: or any [lipsmack] i don't know i i don't think that the problems in california were quite the same 

114.33 124.13 A: um as far as what the government can do i think they do need to have a little more regulation um [lipsmack] in our country we've worked so hard to deregulate things but 

124.45 129.94 A: the whole point of that was to make it competitive so it would be cheaper and it just costs more and more [laughter] 

129.37 138.30 B: yeah ah th- the whole purpose of the privatization which i'm i'm all for if if the corporations had the 

134.31 135.36 A: mhm 

138.25 153.18 B: um er had the ability or the want or the desire to not be greedy but instead to be able to provide their product and make a reasonable profit but i think what happened is that the greed was just so 

144.44 145.36 A: right 

153.22 161.75 B: ah so great well look at american airlines ah here's everybody all the unions all voted to give themselves massive pay cuts 

155.62 156.49 A: yeah 

161.76 169.86 B: and all at the same time the people at the upper echelon were giving themselves bonuses i mean i i i find that totally appalling 

165.72 166.82 A: right 

169.65 176.51 A: yeah there are some real problems and i i don't know how in a society [noise] you know where we believe in um 

176.79 182.47 A: [lipsmack] oh every man making his own way and having the freedom to progress as he wants 

179.41 180.48 B: mhm 

182.46 195.44 A: um financially it- it's hard i don't know how you put parameters on that um i i agree that it it that the problems are the result of greed but i don't know how you deal with greed by legislating anything 

195.22 199.18 B: [lipsmack] no i you you wouldn't um i think part of it is n- 

199.28 202.77 B: is not necessarily the legislation 

202.47 204.15 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

202.97 204.18 B: but 

204.25 205.33 B: (( ah )) 

204.92 205.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

205.55 210.44 B: where we stand as a society more so than 

209.66 213.21 A: i i see what you mean if we we tolerate it 

211.16 212.17 B: because 

213.04 221.68 B: ah when i was a child growing up i grew up in illinois um and i came from a blue collar family my father worked for general motors 

216.55 217.36 A: mhm 

221.43 222.71 A: mhm 

221.76 233.94 B: ah and i was raised with the work ethic that you know you grow up you find a good company to go to work for and you retire from them you do good by them they do good by you 

230.93 231.98 A: right 

233.98 245.37 B: um back in the seventies and the eighties corporations stopped caring about their number one resource which is their employees and they started caring about the stock holders 

242.42 243.38 A: yeah 

245.91 248.03 B: and unfortunate 

246.84 248.59 A: yeah maybe there was a shift 

248.35 250.07 B: a major shift 

249.49 250.46 A: mhm 

250.05 264.13 B: and so now you see that uh corporations basically don't really if they don't care about their employees they don't care about their country and if they don't care about their country they're willing to go offshore and get tax breaks 

263.81 265.04 A: right 

264.38 272.83 B: ah and thereby deprive the country that they live in the ability to give their country money so that there could be programs and so forth 

272.85 281.90 B: and i just think that the government has made it too easy for corporations to avoid the taxes and to um 

280.04 280.93 A: right 

282.17 285.77 B: and to be able to perpetrate a lot of um 

285.78 288.07 B: problems for our society i mean w- 

288.11 300.23 B: when the stock market collapsed and the dotcom industry er bubble burst those poor people that got stock options that were valued at millions in some cases 

288.32 289.39 A: mhm 

293.68 294.86 A: right 

297.61 298.52 A: mhm 

299.66 300.58 A: mhm 

300.24 306.87 B: went to zero and they still have to pay taxes on what they were valued at even though they're valued today at nothing 

306.73 308.05 A: (( oh my goodness )) 

307.06 321.69 B: and they lose their homes because they have to pay the i._r._s. taxes on what they once were worth because they didn't cash them in because they cared about their company they believed in their company when the people at the top of the company doesn't believe in their employees 

312.74 313.70 A: right 

317.01 318.02 A: yeah 

321.67 335.58 A: no [mn] and i really do see what you mean especially with some of those big corporations well you're right they're asking you know the guy on the assembly line to take a cut and and then the top people are being paid more and more th- there's something really wrong there 

334.88 345.38 B: yeah what do you well what do you know over what is your opinion on the the stock options i think they should be taxed personally i don't think it should be like a free way a free run thing 

345.69 352.73 A: i don't follow that stuff enough to know my husband is interested in that and i just say yeah whatever [laughter] 

348.83 350.09 B: yeah okay 

351.64 365.92 B: yeah see er th- there's a lot of talk about that of giving that stock options and i don't i i want to know more about it because i i hope it becomes more of an issue as to what the government can do but personally i'm appalled that the fact that 

361.85 362.79 A: mhm 

365.79 368.44 B: the current administration in power now 

368.69 370.58 B: they really have not er er 

370.72 378.14 B: we were told that they were going to go after the enron and all of that and fix all that and the funny thing is we're not even talking about it anymore 

374.94 375.87 A: mhm 

378.15 384.40 A: i think that the focus has just shifted so much with the war that i i would hope they will get back to those kinds of issues 

380.71 381.57 B: yeah 

383.30 389.41 B: i'm i'm really hoping that they will get back to it because it was something that definitely needed to be fixed and 

388.87 395.23 A: right and nothing's been done um yeah i agree it it seems like when the government 

390.68 391.48 B: no 

395.74 402.56 A: and the people know that there are certain people who should be prosecuted for this that it should happen and somehow it's not really happening 

402.68 404.69 A: and i don't know um 

404.92 410.84 A: who's letting these people get away with it partly as a society we are but then partly the government 

411.42 417.45 A: i don't know why they're afraid to touch the rich people but it seems like they are they sure don't hesitate to go after the poor you know [laughter] 

417.10 430.27 B: no in fact heh to speak on that issue [mn] uh yeah on the crawl today on the bottom of the television screen when you're watching like c._n._n. well part of the crawl was that the it it said one sentence the i._r._s. 

423.34 424.97 A: mhm 

430.16 436.58 B: is asking millions of poor people to prove that they are qualified for the tax 

436.64 439.14 B: um the tax credit 

438.92 440.12 A: [laughter] 

439.44 447.35 B: [laughter] and that crawl went across and i went oh my okay well [laughter] good thing it wasn't a rich person i mean [laughter] 

443.79 445.34 A: oh god 

447.19 451.08 A: yeah i [mn] you know some years back my um 

451.30 452.75 A: husband's widowed 

452.78 460.39 A: mom you know who lives by herself was abandoned by her husband in her middle age and just kind of muddled on was um 

460.92 465.57 A: um had to f- face a i._r._s. audit and she was terrified and we just sort of said of all 

464.31 465.15 B: ah 

465.66 470.07 A: (( people look at all she's got look at the amount of money why are they even bothering )) 

469.65 470.84 B: yeah 

470.31 479.43 A: you know and they ah they seem to afraid to go after the big boys and but they sure weren't afraid to bother her and you know she came out of it fine but it was terrifying 

476.41 477.21 B: no 

479.19 482.94 B: it it and it it had really has come down to 

483.08 484.39 B: sadly 

484.33 495.07 B: the th- the focus of the administration that's in power at any given time as to whether or not you know corporate greed is going to run rampant or not run rampant 

489.66 490.61 A: mhm 

494.83 503.81 B: um i- i'm certainly not i'm certainly not for government control but i'm also old enough to remember when there was indeed one telephone company 

503.43 504.70 A: right 

504.02 510.52 B: and i didn't really feel like i was being taken advantage of by by that one telephone company 

510.36 515.27 A: no i don't think any of us did and i don't think my parents did and um 

511.19 512.24 B: [laughter] 

513.42 514.27 B: no 

514.82 524.80 B: and and [mn] and they said that they broke it all apart and did all of this so that we could get lower rates well the truth of the matter is that was twenty some years ago 

521.08 522.51 A: right 

524.43 525.53 A: right 

524.90 528.69 B: and the rates are about what they were twenty some years ago 

528.61 530.63 A: yeah they they 

528.62 540.95 B: [laughter] and in some cases [mn] more maybe in some cases less but i kind of wonder whether it was broken apart to create an industry that didn't exist you know to help grow the economy 

531.88 532.79 A: right 

540.64 547.37 A: in a way i think in a way i think that's right that um other people have said hey somebody's making money here why [mn] don't i have the chance 

546.95 561.95 B: right and so a and so in that case you know breaking it apart i suppose was good because it did create a lot of the things and probably the internet and all of the the connections that go with the internet was was again part of that but in the same time by deregulating it 

559.36 560.65 A: could be hm 

562.32 569.40 B: one of the big crashes that occurred was worldcom and m._c._i. and those were communications companies 

565.74 566.71 A: yeah 

569.00 570.22 A: right 

569.55 573.37 B: so you know it's like um unbridled 

573.71 578.49 B: unbridled uncontrolled is not good and total control is no good either 

578.14 585.86 A: [mn] [sigh] yeah you don't wanna live in a socialistic country but we go a little too far the other way i think sometimes and um you 

580.62 581.47 B: no 

586.27 592.98 A: know i'm i'm not saying let's hand over everything to the poor and and you know take it all away from the rich or whatever but 

593.00 599.95 A: ah let's have a little concern for each other and not always be out just for the top dollar but be 

598.65 599.69 B: well
