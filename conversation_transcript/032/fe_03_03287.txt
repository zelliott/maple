0.34 1.97 A: hi i'm michelle 

1.75 3.26 B: hi i'm trevey 

3.10 4.67 A: h- how are you 

4.57 6.27 B: i'm doing just fine 

6.31 12.91 A: okay now i mean this is my first call that i've done so [laughter] i'm just trying to okay so we're supposed to talk 

9.55 11.71 B: (( me too [laughter] )) 

13.11 16.46 A: the most significant thing in a life partner 

16.27 19.10 B: right that we would look for in a life partner 

18.72 23.38 A: okay i feel that it is their stability 

24.22 28.20 B: okay i think you should have a harmony of values 

28.30 31.61 B: because if you don't have that harmony of values 

31.86 36.13 B: uh you know you're like apples and oranges 

36.32 38.44 A: that's true that's very true 

38.38 40.74 B: but stability is very important 

40.89 43.40 A: to me it is very important [laughter] because 

42.88 45.11 B: because if go ahead 

43.73 47.96 A: in this day and age you see so many people that are just like 

48.44 59.50 A: seat of their pants you know here and there and just whatever and you know my husband had was on a job had a job for eight years before we married we had the house you know everything 

52.21 53.29 B: right 

59.47 65.75 A: we're just completely stable which you know then allowed me to be able to stay home with my children 

65.74 66.78 B: okay 

66.14 68.44 A: and you know that type of thing but 

68.94 72.92 A: but i do agree that moral you know values are very high as well so 

72.82 82.55 B: right and the compat- i had a very interesting experience a couple of years ago i reconnected with a former student of mine he was a graduate student 

82.56 89.74 B: and as we started chatting online we learned that we had the same childhood dream which was to be medical doctor 

89.82 97.56 B: and somewhere along the way changed to a mixture of media and music i was a music minor in college he's a musician 

89.90 91.61 A: [noise] 

94.20 96.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

97.46 98.40 A: mhm 

97.56 111.56 B: and uh i have gifts and talents in writing and aspire to produce and he has the production and direction gifts and talent so we just you know really hit it off well and has been each other's cheerleaders 

111.97 113.58 B: over the past year 

113.89 115.67 A: that's wonderful [mn] 

116.23 117.98 A: that is really wonderful 

118.29 119.79 A: (( not that )) 

118.39 124.30 B: yeah i i meet so many people who you know um i guess just look at the material 

124.53 125.36 A: right 

125.25 127.58 B: and that's that's not important [laughter] 

127.94 129.72 A: that's not important to me either 

130.24 131.21 A: um 

131.50 138.22 A: i know that you have so many superficial people that they go by their looks or their possessions or 

136.52 138.40 B: right right 

138.64 150.54 A: and to me it's just so much deeper than that because you can date the best looking person in the world and then be the biggest jerk in the world you know or not really have anything to offer and so 

141.27 142.25 B: right 

146.78 148.05 B: exactly 

149.36 150.92 B: exactly 

150.73 159.88 A: i completely understand you know that and therefore i don't understand why you would you know make that your basis of anything 

159.89 168.24 B: right just like a few days ago a friend of mine sent me a picture of a guy she met and wanted to know what i think and i said well what does it matter what i think how he looks 

167.00 168.90 A: [noise] right 

169.39 178.53 A: right well see i have a friend like that now [noise] and she's in her [noise] almost late thirties and still single because you know she's so 

176.46 177.48 B: okay 

178.98 181.23 A: they have to be they have to have money 

179.14 180.02 B: picky 

181.37 185.76 A: they have to have this they have to have that and you you just don't [mn] 

185.85 187.70 A: i don't know [laughter] 

186.98 198.03 B: yeah i have a friend in her fifties who's single never been married and when my uh friend and i first reconnected she asked the first thing she asked me was what kind of car did he drive 

197.88 199.31 A: mhm 

198.96 201.54 B: and i said well what difference does that make 

201.51 202.62 A: right 

202.16 210.09 B: and she's one of these people oh he has to be a certain height and he has to be a certain age and in a certain profession and here she is in her fifties 

209.56 210.61 A: right 

210.15 212.28 B: never married you know 

212.78 217.33 B: and wants desperately to be married and wants to have a big wedding [laughter] in her fifties 

216.09 219.12 A: [laughter] oh 

219.43 224.72 A: i don't understand but like i said that's just superficial people 

224.80 226.00 B: (( but some )) 

224.85 235.49 A: but in this day and age we have that a lot but i feel like that's more media induced because the media tells you that you know there's a certain way that this person that you're supposed to look and 

229.96 231.40 B: i think so too 

234.78 236.40 B: and dress 

235.80 240.28 A: and people go for that and and they're missing a lot i mean 

236.96 238.48 B: right yes 

240.84 252.44 A: because i could care well which my husband is nice looking but you know [laughter] i could have cared less what he looked like he was educated and he was just you know this wonderful person 

245.96 246.80 B: right 

248.03 248.88 B: right 

252.38 256.32 A: and his looks didn't matter he he drove a nineteen 

256.45 267.91 A: eighty eight mustang i mean beat up mustang so you know and if i would have looked in that direction at that aspect and not been with him then i would have missed out on 

259.43 260.14 B: right 

268.43 273.29 A: wonderful years that we had dated and and married and now had kids so 

269.99 271.03 B: oh yes 

272.87 273.98 B: yes 

273.57 284.76 A: and i just you know now we drive a new explorer and [laughter] so i mean it gets better down the down the road but but to not talk to them because of their vehicle or [noise] 

277.22 277.93 B: okay 

279.85 281.07 B: right exactly 

285.09 287.44 A: whatever is just ridiculous 

285.55 288.38 B: well what's the problem is because of their vehicle 

287.77 288.66 A: right 

288.44 303.09 B: just because of their vehicle yeah another really really important uh quality is support and being supportive i mentioned that my friend has been my cheerleader i remember a time when i had a short story due like that day and i hadn't written it written it 

302.86 303.92 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

303.21 314.49 B: and i promised a friend of mine who's edit was editing a book that i would write a story for the book and i just didn't how i would get it done and we were chatting online and he said you'll have it done by two in the morning 

314.57 315.42 A: (( mhm )) 

314.78 320.26 B: but you need to get started so i'm gonna let you go now and i finished it at two fifteen 

317.84 318.94 A: right 

320.32 325.88 B: and when i was halfway through i emailed him and he said i had no doubt you'd get it done you're my hero 

325.77 327.58 A: oh [laughter] 

326.33 337.79 B: so that just really really meant a lot to me because i have friends now who are writing who have been married for a number of years and their husbands just like completely unsupportive 

329.06 330.19 A: (( right )) 

337.55 338.52 A: right 

339.18 348.32 A: no support is very important because like with us my husband had to support me in the fact that well we really supported each other 

348.37 351.60 A: and that now he's the only um 

351.62 353.89 A: the only one working outside the home 

353.63 354.71 B: right 

354.10 363.83 A: which is you know very difficult but he supported my decision that i did not want my kids raised in day care i did not want to pay someone 

356.23 357.31 B: (( oh yeah )) 

361.29 362.11 B: right 

363.92 365.51 A: to raise my children 

365.14 365.99 B: right 

365.66 373.38 A: and so and you know a lot of people would have told me i was crazy um we needed two incomes you know [laughter] i mean 

372.78 373.89 B: right 

373.51 377.83 A: i mean once again back to a superficial society where money's everything 

377.65 378.62 B: right 

378.03 386.38 A: but you know he has been very supportive and i went to school to be a physical therapist and so you know i left something really major behind 

386.06 386.99 B: right 

386.41 388.64 A: to stay home with my kids 

388.86 396.45 A: and i don't feel like that many people would have supported me in that decision or even encouraged me in that decision 

394.26 394.82 B: (( yeah )) 

396.27 402.20 B: and your kids would be so much better because of it my mum was home with me until i was in i think second grade 

401.74 402.76 A: right 

402.52 406.93 B: and my brother i have a brother who's eleven years older than me so he went away to college 

406.43 407.69 A: (( mhm )) 

407.08 413.58 B: and while he was away at college um she knew she had to go back to work to help support him in college 

413.34 414.93 A: right [noise] 

413.54 425.73 B: so by then you know i was in ele- elementary school and her job was such that she got me off to school and then she went to work and then i stayed at a neighbor across the street's house for a couple of hours after school until she came home 

424.68 427.16 A: [noise] right 

426.39 430.36 B: but i mean i think i just really really got such a strong foundation 

430.27 431.48 A: mhm 

430.66 433.14 B: uh from her being at home with me 

433.25 436.11 A: right well see i was the opposite i had [mn] 

436.17 440.46 A: no-one at home with me and that's to me why i actually didn't have family at all 

440.64 446.86 A: um mother or father and that's why it was so important to me to build that with my children 

446.84 447.42 B: (( mhm )) 

447.09 452.91 A: but then back on our topic you know i had to build that with my husband first and i had to have 

451.63 452.52 B: right 

453.01 456.85 A: s- someone that would i want my kids to have a 

456.89 460.30 A: wonderful male and female role model 

460.40 461.27 B: right 

460.60 465.20 A: and you know you really had there's just so much that you have to look for 

465.36 473.39 A: to you know d- decide is this the person i'm going to have children with i mean you know are the qualities that i want passed on to my children 

469.27 470.00 B: (( yeah )) 

473.23 474.22 B: right 

473.60 475.17 A: and so i mean 

475.34 482.52 A: to say that there's like one important quality in a relationship or a life mate i mean there's so many 

482.54 483.81 B: exactly 

483.25 486.54 A: that's it's just you know not one thing or the other 

486.87 490.11 A: but i couldn't have married someone that wasn't god fearing 

490.32 493.53 B: yeah i agree i'm not married but that's like 

492.57 493.46 A: (( right )) 

493.64 496.12 B: the number one priority 

496.18 500.00 A: i couldn't have married someone that wasn't like i said before stable 

500.19 503.72 A: i couldn't have married someone that wasn't family oriented [noise] 

503.89 506.30 A: i mean so it's not just one 

504.01 505.05 B: right 

506.83 511.18 A: one quality over the other i mean they all have to go in like this harmonious flow 

511.29 512.19 B: right 

511.69 515.51 A: because there's so much that you want to leave behind 

515.35 516.17 B: (( exactly )) 

515.69 526.26 A: and you know in your children and there's still this and that in your children and i was never given the example of a marriage or how to be a wife or how to be a mother 

526.11 527.20 B: okay 

526.78 529.81 A: and so that's something that you know you really have to learn 

529.61 530.59 B: right 

530.54 534.41 A: and i was actually scared to be a mother but my husband is just so 

534.58 537.39 A: like i said wonderful you know he just made everything 

537.56 539.92 A: so much better but 

538.81 539.97 B: (( that's great )) 

540.09 546.10 A: but it's just like i said it's just a combined i mean there's just so much that you have to look for 

546.21 547.13 B: right 

546.59 548.29 A: in a mate 

548.59 554.27 B: right and harmony of values is so essential my brother was once engaged to a woman 

548.65 549.82 A: (( and so )) 

554.36 557.57 B: who let her son miss school because 

557.63 559.12 B: he overslept 

559.01 560.20 A: (( mhm )) 

559.52 563.92 B: and uh somebody wouldn't drive him to school so she told him that he didn't have to go to school that day 

563.93 564.91 A: mhm 

564.33 566.87 B: and that was like the end of that engagement [laughter] 

566.84 567.86 A: right 

567.43 574.51 B: 'cause my brother's like how can you tell your child not just to skip school you know he wasn't sick or anything 

574.82 576.10 B: (( you know just because )) 

574.88 575.80 A: (( mhm )) 

576.82 577.62 A: right 

577.73 581.23 B: but that's something he should have known before they got engaged yeah 

581.29 587.09 A: well see i would never date anyone with children already you know that already had children 

587.26 594.63 A: for the fact that i didn't want to be [noise] competitive against their mothers i mean i didn't want 

592.56 593.71 B: okay 

595.43 598.12 A: i don't know i can't really [mn] explain it but 

598.68 599.95 A: i didn't want the mother to
