172.83 181.30 B: yeah yeah we have see in in florida you have all the the birds all the pretty birds are down here and even wild parrots you know

368.15 378.07 A: like a fifty foot like snake wrapped around his neck i don't i don't why anyone would do that but uh actually the other the actu- the other day on the weekend i was walking in the park

447.21 454.03 B: it was a a homing pigeon i could tell by the ankle bracelet he had on it and uh uh it's more colorful than uh 

453.79 462.43 B: the common pigeon the the carrier pigeon has a bigger brain and is a prettier animal so every day he'd come down and say you know thank you for the food and then one day 

462.28 469.87 B: he said let me show you how i can fly and he went up and he soared around like a jet you know and landed down and he said what do you think of that and i said that's fine 

469.67 470.94 A: [laughter] 

469.81 479.93 B: he said well i'm feeling pretty good now and thanks for the food and and i'm going to go on my journey and he took off and he flew away and i never saw him again but
