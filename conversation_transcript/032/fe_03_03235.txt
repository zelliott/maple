328.43 329.51 A: (( oh [laughter] oh )) 

335.14 344.20 B: [lipsmack] like the harry potter series [sigh] and the professor mcgonnagall turns into a cat and she's that really cool grey cat with the black stripes that's what ours look like [mn]

342.65 343.83 A: yeah

347.53 350.48 A: [sigh] my friend just bought ah mini pincher 

348.14 348.70 B: (( mm )) 

350.06 350.92 B: (( [mn] )) 

351.12 364.84 A: and so whenever i see him he's just like a- all over the place just full of energy all the time and [sigh] i realize 'cause i was kind of thinking maybe i should get a pet to practise for having kids later on and [sigh] and things like that and oh 

355.48 356.46 B: yes 

361.75 367.38 B: [laughter] it's totally different [laughter] [laughter] 

365.01 370.97 A: really [laughter] i'm like i don't think i can even handle a p- pet let alone have come kids right now but 

370.07 371.87 B: [sigh] well i have a terrible time t- 

371.84 379.64 B: training dogs potty training dogs [sigh] and i failed with my other two kids [laughter] anyway they were both [sigh] they both well the first the 

374.15 375.06 A: uh-huh 

376.83 378.75 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

379.58 390.59 B: the four year old was three by the time i had her potty trained and the two year old will be three the end of this month and she still isn't potty trained and i keep saying i couldn't even potty train my dogs how can i potty train children [sigh] and i do 

382.61 383.54 A: uh-huh 

385.45 386.75 A: [laughter] 

389.26 394.91 A: [laughter] i do know it was the hardest thing when we had our dog 'cause we didn't know how to potty train it 

392.17 393.48 B: yeah 

394.36 402.00 B: and i think dogs require a lot more attention than the cats do [sigh] i do find that because the dogs are more demanding 

398.35 399.15 A: (( mm )) 

402.23 410.16 B: and they're not as aloof cats tend to be a little more aloof [sigh] and you can leave over night or you know for two days if you have to and the cats will be okay 

405.31 406.10 A: uh-huh 

410.22 411.14 A: uh-huh 

410.28 421.02 B: [mn] but the dogs uh- uh i couldn't do that and especially here in denver where [sigh] you know they bark and we're in a l- little suburb neighborhood here and [sigh] you know they bark and everybody hears them and the neighbors complain and [laughter] 

420.63 423.91 A: right [sigh] so do you leave like food out for your cats an- 

421.09 422.57 B: [sigh] all that 

423.03 427.67 B: oh definitely oh definitely food and water they always have water and [sigh] i have 

426.49 428.56 A: [noise] and they won't eat it all at once though 

427.97 431.30 B: oh uh- uh no they're they're really good about that [sigh] 

430.80 432.00 A: wow 

431.14 440.37 B: and i that is one thing i've enjoyed though with the kids is i think it helps instill a little bit of responsibility with them because they [sigh] even though they're two and four a- almost three and four [sigh] 

437.04 437.92 A: uh-huh 

440.32 452.76 B: they're really good about helping me in the morning with you know oh let's feed the kitties let's give the kitties fresh water and that's a big deal it's let's make sure they have fresh water because we don't want to [sigh] you know you don't like old water the kiddies don't like old water [laughter] 

444.21 445.37 A: (( uh-hum )) 

451.64 454.16 A: [laughter] 

452.91 455.17 B: now the thirteen year old he doesn't care 

455.20 457.00 A: (( oh [laughter] o- )) 

455.27 460.31 B: he wants to love the cat when he wants to love it but he doesn't want to have to take care of it [sigh] 

459.40 461.07 A: oh yeah 

461.66 464.88 B: [mn] so that's been [sigh] an interesting 

464.82 465.80 B: t- thing it's 

465.59 475.44 B: i i know that when i was a kid i grew up with a dog and ah my parents always thought you know it was a good responsibility for the children to learn about how to take care of a pet [sigh] 

469.24 470.06 A: (( oh )) 

474.64 475.79 A: right 

475.25 488.09 B: and i think there's a lot of truth in that but [laughter] like i said i seem to find the [sigh] the teenagers don't aren't as interested in that any more all of a sudden the opposite sex becomes a little more important to them [laughter] and animals go out the window 

484.81 486.82 A: (( [laughter] r- right [laughter] )) 

488.30 493.83 A: and i you know what i wasn't raised around pets and so i was scared of cats and dogs for a really really long time 

488.51 489.09 B: (( [sigh] )) 

493.34 494.36 B: okay 

494.29 501.95 A: 'cause i didn't like well you know like when you first see a dog and [sigh] they're excited and sort of jumping around and that used to scare me so much 

499.42 500.56 B: right 

502.06 503.12 B: (( oh yeah and )) 

502.25 513.04 A: [sigh] and i used i used to lie to people and tell them i was allergic just 'cause i didn't have to deal [lipsmack] with 'cause if you say you're just scared of them they try to like [sigh] you know coax you by saying oh no my dog's different [laughter] [sigh] 

509.55 511.16 B: coax you and 

512.35 516.07 B: right right oh no my dog my dog's really good [sigh] 

515.37 518.62 A: right so i just say like oh i'm allergic in you know 

517.44 531.46 B: o- o- o- oh [laughter] well they're pretty neat um i mean our our cats have free reign of the house you know when we had the dogs here they were just allowed in the kitchen and [sigh] of course the deck and outside and we have a a large kitchen and i would block it off [sigh] and 

519.05 520.20 A: (( that kind of voice )) 

531.27 539.92 B: we'd have a lot of teasing between the dogs and cats going [laughter] on because the cats have full reign of the house [sigh] but um [mn] they they i mean they 

533.59 535.23 A: [laughter] 

539.71 542.58 B: gosh they're like they're like kids in a lot of ways i 

542.43 554.20 B: i used to refer to them before i had children as my grand as my parent's grandchildren and they didn't a- appreciate that [laughter] but the cats sleep you know they sleep with us a lot of times we'll end up with three cats on the bed at night and [sigh] 

546.77 549.26 A: (( [laughter] )) 

554.08 564.79 B: ah or usually they're always in our room however one of 'em really likes to sleep with th- the four year old [mn] she thinks that's pretty cool and the four year old l- loves it [sigh] they're pretty tight [laughter] 

559.09 561.30 A: (( oh that's cute o- o- o- )) 

562.30 563.49 A: oh 

563.96 566.71 A: it's like a little alive teddy bear [laughter] 

565.90 572.69 B: it is it is and ah the cats are really pretty good none of 'em have been declawed or anything [sigh] um 

572.05 573.21 A: (( uh-hum )) 

572.75 581.07 B: [lipsmack] but they're pretty good you know we've had a few scratches [sigh] but i think that's to be understood and it's helped i think to teach the kids to be g- gentle 

578.09 579.10 A: right 

581.13 582.22 A: uh-huh 

581.82 584.24 B: gentle [laughter] 

583.85 585.20 A: yeah 

584.64 594.79 B: [sigh] but ah no we we really en- enjoy our animals um and like i said because i'm a stay at home mom i'm here all the time with 'em [sigh] so they lack for nothing 

593.26 594.19 A: right 

594.61 599.95 B: [laughter] they they're spoiled rotten [laughter] [sigh] and the girls are 

595.94 596.95 A: [laughter] 

597.26 598.10 A: [laughter]
