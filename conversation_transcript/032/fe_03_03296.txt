0.05 1.16 A: hello 

0.86 2.00 B: hello 

2.58 4.09 B: this is hannah 

3.47 5.73 A: hi hannah this is valerie how're you doing 

5.79 7.55 B: not too bad [mn] how are you 

7.10 8.27 A: i'm good 

8.38 12.22 A: so i guess we're talking about life partners [laughter] 

10.92 16.29 B: [laughter] we are i think it's kind of funny they give us a topic to to talk about but that's cool 

16.26 24.50 A: yeah that's one not too bad last time i had something like foreign relations and i didn't know what to talk about [laughter] 

20.23 21.33 B: yes 

22.14 23.13 B: [laughter] 

24.23 26.64 B: yeah um so 

27.05 28.02 B: (( uh )) 

28.20 30.31 B: i guess that you should go first maybe 

30.67 34.64 A: um i guess in a life partner i would i would 

35.28 43.68 A: be looking for most for um things that we have in common some sort of you know something we can really build 

43.65 44.50 B: (( yes )) 

44.47 45.92 A: build around 

46.16 47.33 A: um 

47.70 54.61 A: and then you know after that there sort of goes a list along with that but i think that's more important 

54.71 58.17 A: um things in common things we can relate to 

58.28 63.40 A: may be background or even experiences something some sort of passion that we both share 

63.26 64.07 B: (( mhm yes )) 

65.34 66.40 A: um 

66.50 70.57 A: then after that you know all the regular stuff like um hm 

70.99 76.59 A: looks and intelligence and sense of humor and all those sorts of characteristics 

77.34 78.51 A: what about you 

78.62 79.91 B: i think that i mean 

80.23 90.26 B: in the way that i kind of like interpreted i was thinking about the question and how to answer it it seems to me like it's kind of a you know it's like you can't just pick one thing because it's very complex 

90.03 91.04 A: mhm 

90.40 94.13 B: sort of things that you know what i would want from a life partner 

93.95 94.95 A: mhm 

94.46 100.67 B: but you know assuming that those things are already in place like okay so i could do projects with this person 

100.75 104.63 B: um they're very you know affectionate they you know 

104.56 108.98 B: we spend a lot of time together you know all those things that i kind of like in a partner 

108.63 109.60 A: right 

108.91 120.01 B: assuming that those things are all in place like what would be the most fundamental basis of like what would be the most important thing that without without it nothing else would work so in other words 

119.84 127.90 B: all the other traits would become null and void if this thing didn't exist and i think that because i thinking i've been thinking about this a lot 

122.33 123.39 A: mhm 

128.56 132.29 B: (( and honesty [mn] is the kind of you know it's [mn] )) 

132.90 134.39 B: for me it's kind of the 

135.12 139.13 B: the basis by which nothing else can work unless that's in place 

139.45 143.12 B: and things can work temporarily but they can't work 

143.56 144.74 B: completely 

144.46 145.67 A: (( [noise] [mn] right )) 

145.24 146.15 B: um 

146.22 147.67 A: and what would that be 

147.74 149.45 A: like that one thing 

147.77 148.55 B: uh 

149.10 152.85 B: the hon- well honesty i expect 

151.01 152.04 A: honesty 

153.22 162.37 B: you know it's kind of like right now i'm actually in a really like super fantastic really really great relationship and it's probably the best relationship i've ever been in 

162.09 163.05 A: mhm 

162.55 169.05 B: and i i've never been with anybody that is as honest as this person and i you know 

169.82 175.06 B: i i used to think that my expectations regarding honesty were unrealistic 

174.81 175.84 A: mhm 

175.30 183.93 B: that you know i i shouldn't expect people to be as forthright as i am because i've i had never met anybody who was 

183.33 184.33 A: mhm 

184.50 187.62 B: and finally i met this person and um 

188.16 189.65 B: now we are that way 

189.89 195.53 A: that's great i thought i thought you were going to say trust [laughter] but it's kind of related 

193.65 194.58 B: (( yeah )) 

195.40 196.36 B: yeah 

195.78 204.64 A: and uh it's funny it's funny you say that because it's i'm kind of like in the opposite [laughter] and i have like no trust 

200.84 201.90 B: (( yeah )) 

204.66 205.57 B: (( yeah )) 

204.76 214.34 A: um for this person but it's it's really funny because i've very honest and like to the point that you know like candidly honest 

214.21 221.73 A: so it really bothers that you know like i have a really big problem with people not being honest 

221.36 222.60 B: yeah 

222.04 223.03 A: (( no )) 

223.10 229.53 A: i totally agree i think that that surely is like trust and honesty you know are right up there 

229.04 229.67 B: (( hm y- )) 

229.57 232.88 A: but um it's the kind of thing like you 

234.03 246.16 A: can't really look for it you know what i mean like it's like you you can't you don't know that the person is dishonest or honest until you're already in that relationship you know what i mean 

237.84 238.76 B: (( yeah )) 

245.67 247.03 B: yeah 

246.79 247.86 A: um 

249.31 256.16 A: i was i was thinking more along the lines of you know what do you look for like like a i look for a soulmate kind of thing 

256.09 256.92 B: (( yeah how )) 

256.18 257.16 A: you know 

257.28 260.97 A: and i hope this person is [laughter] honest 

260.65 262.59 B: long have you guys been together 

262.50 266.35 A: um two years two years yeah 

263.87 268.73 B: two years but you're you're you're still having a little bit of a problem with trust with him 

268.71 270.71 A: yeah because 

270.72 278.12 A: i find that he very much like he would rather lie than upset you 

278.43 289.25 A: so it's almost like i can't take his word at anything i have to kind of dig and dig and dig and then i can sort of see what what's the truth from that and what's not 

278.99 279.88 B: (( yeah )) 

288.92 296.27 B: yeah i actually i had i had i used to be in a relationship like that and i actually um one of the first things i said to the person i'm seeing now 

289.39 290.28 A: you know 

296.01 297.10 A: mhm 

296.50 303.47 B: is i said you know you have to be straight with me and honest with me even if it means that it's going to be difficult 

304.03 307.87 B: and that the outcome of you being honest with me is that i'm going to get upset 

308.22 315.46 B: and that you'll have to deal with the communication that surrounds having been honest with me about something that is a problem for me 

315.78 323.27 B: and if you can't be that you know i said you have to be honest with me to the point where you might lose me you know 

322.93 323.82 A: right 

323.99 334.05 B: like you might actually say something to me that's honest but as a result of saying it i end not wanting to be part of the relationship and i said but if you can't do that then i i can't see you 

334.08 341.50 B: and i also said and if if i find out that you weren't straight with me about something that you 

341.96 356.01 B: you know that that you you didn't deal with you weren't straight with me because you didn't want to deal with the consequences of what it meant then you definitely will lose me and i won't and and i've kind of like stuck by that in the sense that you know past situations 

355.90 357.03 B: recently 

356.87 357.80 A: mhm 

357.13 364.28 B: have ended things because of things like that and so he kind of understood that there was really clear but he also understood the reasons behind it 

364.50 371.07 B: like he kind of understood that he could trust me not to overreact if he told me something like you know i'm having 

371.77 376.93 B: some concerns about something or i you know i went out last night with my ex girlfriend and had dinner 

376.70 377.54 A: right 

377.13 385.93 B: like i i was gonna flip out um it was like a combination of like making it possible for him to communicate with me without me 

386.77 397.69 B: you know actually having like a really strong negative reaction and of course being able to work with him about whatever it was and also him agreeing that he was going to be straight with me [laughter] under all circumstances and it's hard but 

389.53 390.45 A: (( all right )) 

397.45 409.95 A: [mn] i i i can imagine so because i i would lose it [laughter] you know i i wouldn't be like i would like rationally i would be able to be like okay this is not so bad but you know like 

401.93 402.90 B: (( yeah )) 

409.98 414.95 A: b- before you know before getting to that point i would probably 

415.16 417.08 A: be really pissed off 

416.72 419.22 B: yeah well the thing is is that i think that 

419.52 420.43 B: um 

421.07 428.13 B: you know ultimately people are like boy i wish i hadn't told you x y and z because it's upset you and i said well what upset me wasn't the fact that you told 

428.42 430.88 B: what upsets me is that the fact that you feel that way 

430.91 431.79 A: right 

431.33 432.68 B: you did that 

432.72 438.94 B: um and they don't understand that by not telling the person that they're with 

439.77 441.46 B: you know how they really feel 

441.04 442.04 A: mhm 

441.86 443.76 B: or what's really going on 

444.41 447.44 B: they're they're only postponing the inevitable 

447.67 451.06 B: you know they're only postponing what's gonna come out eventually anyway 

450.85 462.86 A: right and for me it's not it it also not telling also kind of like doubles it because it's a lie by just by omission you know what i mean so it's like so now not only 

459.52 460.45 B: (( yeah )) 

463.09 466.35 A: are you feeling that way but you're also deceiving me 

466.04 469.22 B: yeah i can't i mean basically 

466.66 467.77 A: you know [noise] 

469.71 474.80 B: as far as i'm concerned a relationship no longer exists if i'm if i'm being deceived 

475.35 481.00 B: whether it be through omission or otherwise so my partner and i actually you know we we share 

481.04 482.79 B: email inboxes 

482.56 483.53 A: mhm 

483.08 484.53 B: you know it's kind of like 

485.68 486.92 B: we're so 

487.28 497.94 B: connected that we actually read each other's mail if we want to i mean we do it all the time or anything it's just that sometimes he'll tell me to go in there to look at emails because of plans we have or or something 

495.84 497.37 A: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

498.38 500.18 B: and 

500.42 511.29 B: you know [mn] he doesn't get defensive if i ask him where he was or why he's talking to so and so and you know it's just more like me checking in you know so i don't know 

508.91 510.05 A: mhm 

511.35 515.65 A: well that's i think that's really great i don't i can't say the same thing [laughter] 

515.68 522.78 A: like i've i shared my password you know and stuff like that but it's odd like he won't 

522.87 526.20 A: i have access to his kind of thing but like 

525.20 526.01 B: mhm 

526.35 533.51 A: he you know constantly like tells me that he needs his privacy and because of the fact that 

533.63 534.56 A: (( i )) 

534.58 542.15 A: you know i can't trust him it's like when he asks for privacy i almost feel like it's because he's he has something to hide from me 

542.19 543.50 A: you know [noise] 

542.83 551.97 B: he's not being straight with you it doesn't i mean if he's not being forthcoming and he's kind of lying through omission because he doesn't want to deal with the like the communication surrounding certain things that he does 

551.39 552.32 A: mhm 

551.99 564.31 B: then it just goes to follow that whether he has something to lie to hide or not it's gonna feel that way it's going to feel icky and it's gonna feel bad and um 

558.38 559.32 A: right 

564.11 570.89 B: you know maybe he would be open to to like you know talking about this and shifting it i don't know i have no idea 

571.08 573.77 B: 'cause you're in that situation but 

572.54 574.35 A: yeah it's a big issue with 

574.87 576.40 A: us and 

575.12 577.21 B: does he does he mind talking about it 

578.57 579.74 A: um 

580.13 588.74 A: [mn] yes and no you know like it's it's it's a really big issue so it comes up quite often and sometimes we do talk about it 

586.30 587.31 B: (( hm )) 

588.79 597.52 A: and sometimes he tells me that he feels like i'm smothering him and other times he's just like you have to just stop questioning me so much 

597.76 599.96 A: but i almost feel like
