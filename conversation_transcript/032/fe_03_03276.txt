411.06 413.07 A: wow you you it's like 

413.32 425.42 A: it's hard to explain like you read about these things happening or you see it on t._v. and to think that that happened to you that's scary but you did the right thing i mean you know there's still women that just don't stand up for themselves and 

418.75 420.18 B: oh i know 

421.46 423.41 B: mhm

428.08 433.65 B: yeah i with my husband dan he's a um a corrections officer in the state prison here 

433.75 437.79 B: and i was worried that he would be violent because you know he's a correction officer 

437.85 449.03 B: he's not at all you know he he composes himself really well because he can't let the prisoners get on his nerves and so he never raises his voice to me or anything so 

449.02 454.06 B: i trust him with that i think it's important that you know you know they're not gonna hurt you 

453.86 461.72 A: well also he's he probably knows how to separate work from you know being outside of the the job 

461.47 462.49 B: right 

462.05 465.26 A: it's two totally separate things 

465.52 470.36 A: that's one thing like my husband he's always been like a hard worker 

469.97 471.40 B: mhm 

470.51 483.03 A: he works in computers and um you know he ever since he's been a little kid like he would he would always have like a good job you know what i mean like that was always like that's stable to me also you you have a kid 

478.57 481.32 B: mhm [noise] 

481.35 482.95 B: yeah 

483.56 486.90 B: yes i have a little boy [laughter] 

485.34 486.58 A: (( how old )) 

486.97 489.53 B: he's two years old 

488.75 491.01 A: oh wow i have four [laughter] 

490.52 494.38 B: i have four also but i've only got two living with me right now 

494.72 502.06 A: oh wow i have i've never really spoken to anyone else that has four [laughter] most people look at me when i say that and they're like 

495.73 497.44 B: we have 

498.51 501.21 B: [laughter] 

501.42 503.44 B: (( i know [laughter] )) 

502.57 503.73 A: [laughter] 

504.07 505.45 A: we have um 

505.55 508.06 A: we have my son's nine 

508.18 513.40 A: and then my daughter is gonna be eight they're seventeen months apart 

512.95 515.38 B: mhm 

513.42 527.84 A: and that's what and when i had her i got very ill and that's why i said like my husband was always there for me like you know i had a pulmonary embolism so i i stayed in the hospital but she came home and that was like a big life 

516.79 517.76 B: uh-huh 

522.14 523.12 B: uh-huh 

527.75 539.83 A: you know like like i was sick for a few days but once that passed i still had to stay in the hospital anyway and i was on i was on medication and he was always there like through through everything he took care of the kids and you 

528.12 530.20 B: yeah 

533.29 534.90 B: yeah 

538.91 541.50 B: [noise] [noise] mhm 

540.17 545.97 A: know and then i and then i decided to have another one and [laughter] it was twins

544.37 547.76 B: [laughter] oh my gosh 

546.99 555.40 A: so again like that was you know i wasn't sick during the pregnancy or anything but he really helped me out a lot and 

551.24 556.04 B: mhm yeah that's important too 

555.61 567.49 A: and then at the um the twins were born premature so again like it was you know what i mean like every time i did something like nothing went right i never had like everything normal [laughter] so he was always there holding my hand through 

565.85 568.54 B: (( yeah )) 

567.61 572.55 A: everything and um you know i think that made us stronger 

572.09 574.68 B: (( yeah )) 

572.79 576.17 A: it was something to build upon as uh 

576.68 587.06 A: you know they were in in i._c._u. and you know one came home before the other and it was i mean it was sad for me when i when my daughter came home from the hospital without me 

586.71 588.74 B: mhm 

586.97 592.32 A: but when you do it the other way around and it was me and i came home and not them 

591.98 593.70 B: mhm 

592.47 594.72 A: that's just like it killed me 

594.12 595.45 B: yeah 

594.75 599.77 A: you know but he knew what he knew like what to do and it was like you know
