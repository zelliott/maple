0.28 1.49 B: hello 

1.61 3.26 A: hi i'm dave 

2.88 5.14 B: hi dave i'm my name's tara 

4.70 6.20 A: hi how are you tara 

5.81 6.99 B: good how are you 

6.52 7.81 A: good thanks 

8.35 13.69 B: all right so uh i guess i should ask are you married or have a 

12.57 17.06 A: uh no i'm not i'm only twenty i have a girlfriend how about you 

17.26 21.11 B: i'm twenty six and i've been married for about five years 

20.76 21.96 A: (( mhm )) 

21.40 25.31 B: and um i have a little two year old daughter 

25.04 26.04 A: (( uh-huh )) 

26.18 27.26 B: so 

27.62 34.01 B: anyway so what do you like about your girlfriend or what do you think of what is something that you look for when you're 

34.06 36.24 B: looking at someone to 

36.38 37.81 B: possibly 

37.84 40.92 B: you know be your companion for life 

40.35 48.53 A: [laughter] i think that general compatibility probably is the best thing but um it varies 

49.26 53.43 A: from person to person for me i need someone who's a 

51.56 52.13 B: (( [noise] )) 

53.97 57.98 A: um you know like a nice general- genuinely good person 

57.74 58.66 B: uh-huh 

58.12 60.12 A: i think um 

60.81 62.68 A: i like a sense of humour 

63.38 65.81 B: yeah that's definitely important i think 

65.82 78.42 B: the more i look at things the more i'm like you know it's i'm so glad i found somebody with a sense of humour because in life you go through so many bizarre things and just stuff happens to you and it's good to be able to 

78.46 83.19 B: i i guess it's just helps take away a lot of stress especially when you're going through 

83.23 93.20 B: stressful things if you're able to sit back and laugh at it a little bit and not take everything so seriously and uptight if you have a sense of humour about things it's a lot easier to 

93.26 95.23 B: cope with stuff i think 

94.85 96.38 A: right definitely 

96.45 97.31 B: so 

97.68 99.14 A: oh hold on a second 

98.87 99.73 B: sure 

100.80 103.45 A: okay sorry [laughter] um 

101.67 103.14 B: that's all right 

103.41 103.99 B: (( [cough] )) 

103.49 105.49 A: yeah um 

105.97 109.57 A: i think that uh the most important thing is that 

109.60 115.15 A: you need someone who will [noise] last as a friend even after like the lust is gone [noise] [mn] 

114.59 119.86 B: uh-huh oh you're you're right on [laughter] i think you know when i was 

119.75 121.42 B: dating and everything 

121.29 135.91 B: you know i dated guys it was like you know it was fun for one night and you know and you're you're thinking oh this is a great date or whatever and you know this guy's really cute or what- you know whatever but sometimes it was like the guys who tried to be like all romantic and whatever just 

135.80 138.57 B: didn't work yeah i just needed somebody who 

138.82 152.26 B: who was going to be like my best friend because that's basically what this person ends up being to you it's got to be someone that's going to you know like replace your buddies it's going to be the person who you'r- it's going to be your confidante and you're 

152.23 155.48 B: you know it's that's going to be the first person you want to turn to 

155.61 163.90 B: um when you have exciting news or when you have trouble or whatever they have to be the person you can talk to and who you can you know be your friend because 

164.37 170.96 B: um i've seen a lot of situations where if uh you know if a husband and wife or whatever if they're 

171.74 181.78 B: the person that they're going to when they have struggles or whatever is not that you know is not their spouse or whatever maybe they go talk to their girlfriend or they talk to their mom or dad or something 

181.85 189.27 B: then there's something else in you know that comes in between their relationship and i think that is unhealthy 

189.33 195.54 B: i don't know if you understand what i'm saying [laughter] but it's like you know that person has to be your best friend i think 

191.39 192.77 A: no definitely i 

195.44 196.33 A: yeah 

195.61 203.69 B: because otherwise you know if there's someone else that comes in between your relationship then it's just not going to be healthy 

204.38 206.18 B: i think so 

205.49 208.44 A: right how long did you date before you got married 

208.08 210.14 B: uh we dated about three years 

209.87 211.13 A: (( three years eh )) 

210.62 222.05 B: mhm which actually from the community where we were living that's a pretty long time we like watched some of our friends like meet start dating you know and get married all in the time that we were still dating so 

222.71 227.99 B: it was uh you know it seemed like a long time but you know a lot of times people 

228.56 235.41 B: you know i guess in different parts of the world different things are acceptable or whatever where are you calling from by the way 

235.02 236.97 A: [noise] i'm calling from new york 

236.49 238.04 B: oh from new york okay 

237.43 239.80 A: you see i live in massachusetts i'm at school right now 

239.59 240.63 B: oh okay 

240.91 244.04 B: well i am calling from hawaii but 

243.41 244.46 A: oh wow 

244.36 248.84 B: um i just we just moved from washington d._c. 

249.02 252.77 B: um last year my husband just finished medical school there so 

254.17 255.04 B: but 

255.40 258.21 B: so so yeah it's kind of 

259.84 262.79 B: i think there's a lot of factors that go in to 

263.12 264.05 B: what 

265.01 268.87 B: what you're you know what you're looking for but i think 

269.03 272.08 B: that you know finding that best friend is really important 

270.93 271.76 A: (( [noise] )) 

273.47 274.38 B: so 

273.56 275.43 A: yeah definitely 

276.53 279.71 B: so what else do you think i feel like i've been dominating the 

279.29 280.58 A: [laughter] 

279.76 281.59 B: talking here [laughter] 

281.24 285.42 A: oh jeeze i don't know i don't have as much life experience as you so i guess [laughter] 

284.64 288.65 B: oh yeah i got like six years on you [laughter] 

286.86 287.78 A: yeah 

287.79 289.12 A: um 

290.02 291.29 A: uh 

291.56 293.73 A: i don't know i guess um 

297.91 299.52 B: [noise] 

300.42 314.39 A: i feel i don't know i think three years is definitely long enough to decide you're going to get married i know people who are gotten married in much shorter times than that and are still living happily together but i i don't think that's uh a very as likely scenario that 

310.27 311.47 B: mhm 

314.09 320.61 B: yes i mean people that you know that some times that happens to it's like wow amazing and sometimes they last for 

320.69 322.73 B: fifty years or whatever but 

323.05 324.04 B: um 

324.42 338.02 B: i guess it just depends on the people but i think another thing i'm i'm just thinking here what else is important i think another thing that's important is to have the same goals in mind because if you're going to get married to someone 

338.26 343.45 B: um and you're not working toward the same thing then you're going to have a constant kind of friction 

343.82 352.05 B: so like if you have the same goals as far as having a family or you know what you want to do with your lives or how you wanna 

352.28 354.77 B: you know run your household or whatever 

354.89 363.67 B: i think that makes a big difference too in how how well how compatible you are and how happy you'll be 

358.71 359.90 A: right 

363.52 373.98 A: also probably uh where your where your job requires you to be like if one person's from the city and another person wants to be a environmentalist or a surfer in hawaii or something like [laughter] 

371.73 372.68 B: uh-huh 

372.96 379.87 B: [laughter] yeah actually for me it wasn't uh i i thought it would be um 

381.02 391.01 B: fun to travel and stuff like that because i grew up in a lot of different places and my husband you know he grew up in the same place pretty much his whole life you know same house 

391.09 392.52 B: and so 

392.92 398.68 B: we were coming from really different backgrounds 'cause i like hadn't lived anywhere longer than three years ever before in my life 

398.82 404.70 B: and so to me it was really attractive because he joined the military to go to medical school 

404.81 416.96 B: and you know he said well you know if i if i do this you know it means we'll probably have to move round every couple of years and whatever and i thought hey that'll be great 'cause that's the lifestyle i'm used to and i get bored if i'm stuck some place for longer than 

416.93 423.07 B: you know three years i start to get antsy but for him it was something kind of different and um 

419.02 420.04 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

423.44 435.52 B: you know he wasn't sure how it would be but because it was his medical schooling and his endeavour he just you know he didn't want to put me in a position where i might be uncomfortable if i didn't feel comfortable to travel around or whatever 

435.45 436.50 A: yeah 

435.88 439.50 B: but fortunately it worked out 'cause obviously i enjoy that so 

438.84 445.96 A: [laughter] i think i'd like to um after school and after i find someone that i'd i'd like to travel round for 

446.22 459.79 A: maybe a couple of years try living in a diff- different couple of places but i think i'll probably end up back in new england yeah all my family's in new england and and i just like i like the area a lot so i think i'd like to settle down there 

452.16 453.22 B: you think so 

454.82 455.85 B: mhm 

457.76 458.78 B: yeah 

459.28 462.29 B: i wish we would have made more more trips 

462.32 473.86 B: we we went to connecticut one time for a fourth of july or something and uh new york for you know just a day but when we were out there we sh- we really should have taken more time to go go visit 

474.48 476.70 B: go- since we were so close but 

476.51 477.62 A: (( [laughter] )) 

476.74 479.97 B: you know medical school we were just busy i guess 

479.95 481.26 A: right 

480.82 481.79 B: so 

482.11 483.43 B: but yeah that's 

484.33 488.49 B: that's uh i think that is important 'cause i know of couples where 

488.65 498.56 B: you know there's a lot of people that resent their husband or whatever because of their job that makes them move all the time you know growing up i met a lot of people who moved around a lot 

498.58 505.09 B: and i knew a lot of the families where either the kids or the mom 

505.10 510.86 B: were always kind of resentful of the dad 'cause his job was the what was making them move so often 

511.50 514.16 B: so i think you just got to have 

514.53 524.25 B: maybe the same kind of goals for that and if not the same kind of goals you have to be very patient and understanding and and uh you know find someone that's really 

525.46 528.06 B: going to put in a hundred percent of their 

528.54 529.44 B: uh 

529.60 531.70 B: their efforts into the marriage you know 

531.54 532.96 A: (( yeah all right )) 

533.02 533.78 B: (( uh )) 

533.99 540.42 A: along with that similarity like you you definitely also need your own activities that you can spend time apart 

540.13 547.32 B: oh yeah definitely i mean my husband and i we have he's he likes to play sports and stuff and i'm not really very athletic but i like 

547.32 559.03 B: art and music and so he appreciates art and music he really likes to you you know go listen to a symphony or go to an art e- art museum or something like that so he enjoys that but he doesn't 

559.10 567.71 B: do it and i you know i'm not really actually big on watching sports or anything but i like to every once in a while go jogging with him or something so 

567.93 575.87 B: but we do have definite separate activities that are our own and then we also have things that we enjoy doing together so that's definitely good 

574.10 576.52 A: yeah that sounds sounds great 

577.22 590.43 B: so it's good to have um qualities where you're not like exactly the same in everything too you know if i'm good at certain things and he's good at certain things then we kind of like balance each other out we're like the complements to each other you know what i mean 

588.97 592.16 A: mm combine to make the perfect person 

591.42 594.01 B: yeah to make a whole so that's good 

592.74 593.68 A: yeah 

595.27 599.95 B: [cough] if you find someone that has enough things that are unique about themselves
