230.14 242.14 B: some kind of chicken uh wire there or something and he was poking his head about there and i could see him getting somewhere where i wouldn't be able to get him back you know and it would be costly to get him out so he's been leashed now 

239.23 240.47 A: right 

241.50 244.43 A: well that's good you got to keep him in

341.11 353.29 B: no trust me it well you know my we had like six cats six female cats when we lived on this big piece of property when i was probably in the fourth fifth grade and mom told them to get everybody spayed and they didn't so 

341.65 342.98 A: [laughter] 

353.29 359.54 B: you know there was like four females and they all got pregnant at the same and we ended up with like thirty two kittens

359.36 360.38 A: wow 

360.02 363.95 B: yeah that was fun [laughter] [noise]

364.25 371.25 B: ye- yeah well i've always liked cats cats are they're easier to maintain i mean i like dogs i like other pets but 

366.88 367.79 A: yeah 

372.24 380.14 B: y- you can leave a cat for a week if you have to and someone can come feed it and that's about it 

378.89 384.08 A: or you can get those self feeding mechanisms that always just make sure the bowl's full 

382.40 395.41 B: yeah but you'd like to have someone come check and give them a little water and give them a little little treat or two but for a dog every day someone's got to come walk that dog play with them give them a little fetch you can't run around the yard 

385.79 386.81 A: yeah 

391.18 392.29 A: yeah 

394.42 395.72 A: right 

395.33 399.17 B: so that's why i really like cats and if you got to travel 

397.05 397.98 A: right 

399.04 402.45 B: a cat's more likely to travel with you i had one cat 

402.26 415.55 B: that that uh the reason i g- just got him was because my other cat had died and i didn't get a cat for a while but [noise] this cat travelled everywhere i mean i tr- i did a lot of travelling for work and he'd go across country with me um in in a plane 

406.72 407.69 A: uh-huh 

408.72 409.84 A: mhm 

415.44 416.49 A: wow 

415.97 424.91 B: it's thirty five bucks extra you put them in where your your uh foot room would be and he just sits there he sleeps it's a dog it's a dog carrier they just go to sleep 

420.30 421.27 A: right 

424.90 425.78 A: right 

425.06 432.66 B: but you know they get a little upset and meow a little at the beginning the taking off and everything but once the plane's in the air the vibrations 

432.77 435.04 B: puts most cats right to sleep 

435.01 437.06 A: so you're talking in a uh 

437.13 438.71 A: in a box 

438.16 442.21 B: in a it's an a- it's an approved airline cat carrier 

441.44 442.41 A: okay 

442.49 447.32 B: and uh they're probably about eight inches tall and um 

445.49 446.76 A: right 

447.49 455.93 B: you can get the nice leather ones now the material ones so they push down a little so they're a little taller for the cat but they slide you know 

453.64 454.65 A: right 

455.56 457.79 A: still slide under the under the seat 

457.22 468.58 B: under the seat on the floor in front of you that's your little area slides right up there you sit and they sit there it costs seventy five bucks each way or something or seventy five bucks a round trip or something like that yeah 

460.40 461.14 A: that 

464.78 466.28 A: that's pretty cool 

466.99 470.09 A: so how often have you travelled with the cat then 

469.63 483.40 B: well this cat none but my other cat he probably i don't know probably eight or nine times across the country yeah e- e- even layovers he did those pretty good you know the first time i travelled with him i put i uh tranquilized him 

476.21 477.23 A: wow 

483.41 488.03 B: but then the second time the vet said try him out and [noise] vibration puts him right to sleep 

488.72 490.13 A: that's good to know 

489.80 492.01 B: (( yeah but )) 

490.33 497.71 A: and and uh and he was good in you know wherever you were going did you stay in hotel rooms or 

495.47 497.31 B: (( yeah )) 

497.52 504.79 B: um yeah he he liked it he li- as long as he was with me he was cool he loved it i mean it's you know i had the cat since i was like [noise] fourth grade [noise] so 

500.99 501.96 A: right 

504.38 505.47 A: okay 

505.58 513.95 B: you know he uh you know he really liked wha- he'd rather take the flying and be where i am than because it'd be for a couple of months so you know we'd go 

513.00 514.89 A: oh it'd be for a couple of months 

514.26 519.19 B: yeah so we'd fly and and then we'd fly out and he didn't seem to mind it too much 

518.88 519.89 A: okay 

519.34 522.76 B: he's wake up during the you know the like the layovers 

522.33 523.30 A: mhm 

522.73 536.32 B: but he'd be pretty good it's just the um the beginning's a little you know the whole drive and then the getting to there [noise] you know tha- that's the part that's the worst really but once they get up once the plane takes off they're great they go right to sleep 

533.26 534.14 A: right 

536.57 537.89 A: that's amazing 

536.73 540.13 B: (( i love it yeah yeah yeah i was a little worried the first )) 

538.90 541.85 A: oh you know dogs wouldn't do that dogs would freak out 

541.34 544.40 B: [noise] well not only that you have to put them in the hold 

543.17 544.96 A: yeah because they're too big 

544.43 558.30 B: and i'm a li- i won't fly in the hold [laughter] so i'd rather have them come with me but yeah they're pretty good it's cost so much but that's about it and you get to board first that's always nice 

546.96 547.84 A: right 

549.71 550.88 A: a good point 

551.79 553.48 A: yeah 

558.33 560.27 A: you oh you get to board first 

559.51 564.50 B: (( [noise] sure you're like a per- you're like a person with a kid yeah yeah )) 

561.06 563.09 A: ah yeah that's nice too 

563.43 567.00 A: you get that uh overhead space before somebody else 

565.95 568.06 B: [noise] [laughter] right yeah 

567.05 571.93 A: snags it now the extra seventy five dollars to take the cat on the plane 

568.21 569.15 B: (( [noise] )) 

571.67 573.59 B: (( seventy seventy five bucks )) 

572.04 577.75 A: is that to add uh a carry on or does that still count as one of your carry ons that 

577.14 584.57 B: well they say it counts as one of your carry ons but have you ever i don't know recently it's probably true but in the past nobody counted carry ons 

584.14 585.36 A: right 

584.79 586.73 B: i've seen people with like four or five 

586.36 587.41 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

587.20 590.02 B: that's why there's never any room up there 

589.09 592.37 A: that's unless you get to board first mm 

590.89 595.80 B: exactly it's hence the cat [laughter] 

593.94 594.95 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

595.02 599.89 A: well what i don't like is when people board first uh you know the people in the back of the plane are usually the ones boarding
