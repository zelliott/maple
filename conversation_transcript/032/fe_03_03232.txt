294.49 295.52 A: right 

294.84 302.29 B: 'cause he's still like really young and i wouldn't really see you know him being all [sigh] running around and everything like that but um

339.13 339.95 A: (( um )) 

339.30 353.97 B: yeah i remember when my sister um was born she's like a lot younger than i am and ah [sigh] the same thing happened to our cat then [sigh] and she was a little bit older [sigh] um at that point and um [sigh] 'cause she's ah 

353.88 363.64 B: much older than my s- sister and she used to [laughter] kind of like all right you know that's enough [laughter] she used to get dragged around in little d- doll carts and everything outside 

363.76 367.34 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] they used to strap her into the [laughter] s- stroller [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

364.00 364.91 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

367.63 379.14 A: yeah she yeah our cat's a pretty good sport about it though i mean she hides i guess when she's not in the mood but ah we try to defend her [laughter] as best as we can [laughter]

394.49 395.95 B: (( [sigh] uh-hum )) 

395.41 405.14 A: and when you have two little kids who are always hanging on you all day long sometimes you the last thing you want to do is get in bed and have a cat s- you know stand on top of you and 

403.98 405.02 B: right 

405.10 414.11 B: [sigh] well they always seem to take up most of the bed anyway and i wake up and [sigh] whenever my cat sleeps with me and i'm on like the edge of the bed and then i feel bad because i don't want to like you know 

414.18 419.36 B: wake her up so [sigh] and she's all like you know s- stretched out [laughter] on the whole thing [sigh] 

419.66 421.49 A: yeah [noise] what color is she 

421.40 422.81 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

422.90 425.22 B: (( [lipsmack] white with um ))

428.40 434.00 B: black um spot on its back and it's tail is actually kind of like striped so 

434.00 438.31 A: hm and did you get here from the the pound or did 

438.17 447.21 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] um the one i got from a friend of mine whose cat had kittens and the o- other one [sigh] um

447.30 448.80 B: [lipsmack] the one i got 

449.30 458.89 B: um when i was at my parent's house we actually got two of 'em together that were sisters [sigh] and they were from a from a farm [sigh] from someone that my mom knew so 

456.85 457.81 A: uh-huh 

459.82 460.76 A: yeah 

460.13 468.88 B: [lipsmack] that's why they stayed out because like you know they were outside most of the time before we got them so [sigh] they were used to that but um 

466.58 467.50 A: right 

469.86 470.97 B: (( [lipsmack] so yeah )) 

471.39 478.69 A: [sigh] well we we got ours from the pound and my husband's not from this country and he thought it was r- really funny because we had to ah 

478.50 482.63 A: [sigh] when we lived in south america we just stopped at a local [sigh] 

482.53 494.79 A: wine store and they had a litter and they said sure take one and we drove off with one but here we had to go through a whole screening process at the shelter and they called three references and [sigh] we had to do 

494.08 495.46 B: oh really [cough] 

494.60 505.81 A: all this before so [laughter] he thought that was really kind of bizarre but i mean it's it's probably it's a good idea it's just very different [laughter] 

496.90 498.33 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

504.85 514.34 B: yeah yeah that is good that they do that because i never i never went you know got one from there before so i didn't know that they do that but [sigh] it is that is good that they do that though 

514.37 514.93 B: (( so )) 

515.38 516.37 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

515.45 516.25 B: huh 

517.07 520.51 B: yeah well my cat now the older one she's kind of d- deaf 

520.70 525.70 B: so she meows really [laughter] l- loud because she thinks no one can hear h- her [laughter] 

525.42 526.90 A: oh no 

526.27 532.85 B: so she'll go like wander you know like around the house or outside and then she'll realize she's by herself and she gets upset [laughter] 

533.83 536.62 A: (( ah our cat has never been a meower [noise] )) 

536.71 539.27 A: which i- i'm kind of happy about [sigh] 

539.31 543.65 B: yeah my other one isn't the one that stays inside which is good 'cause 

543.74 545.57 B: [sigh] we i had a cat i 

545.65 548.33 B: lived with a friend of mine like two years ago 

548.35 552.76 B: and she got a cat it was just in the summer time and she got a cat 

552.67 565.30 B: i don't know where she got it from [sigh] and the thing like meowed like twenty four seven it just wouldn't be quiet [sigh] i think there was something wrong with it actually [laughter] because it really wouldn't stop meowing [sigh] you know when you fed it or anything so 

566.48 567.49 B: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

566.93 567.51 A: (( oh no )) 

567.56 570.81 B: (( i definitely think there was something [laughter] wrong with it [sigh] [noise] )) 

570.23 571.24 A: right 

571.48 577.42 A: well sometimes they they they can be probably traumatized if they were in 

577.93 580.21 A: [sigh] homes that they weren't treated very 

580.31 584.77 A: (( w- well and then they go to [sigh] like a shelter an animal shelter )) 

584.58 585.67 B: right 

585.74 590.03 A: we got our our cat really young i think she was like eight weeks old so [lipsmack]
