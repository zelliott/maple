80.20 83.13 A: and uh but we do have a lot in common so 

82.18 90.58 B: well they say you know incompatibility is the grounds for a great marriage and and i i think i truly believe that because there are a lot of things that 

90.72 101.01 B: you know that i like that he doesn't like and and vice versa and especially like food i mean i'm like this health nut and he's like this junk food junkie so [laughter] 

99.10 99.93 A: yeah 

100.08 103.73 A: i eat everything organic he eats at mcdonalds every day 

102.81 107.78 B: ex- exactly totally one hundred percent true [laughter] 

103.99 105.44 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

106.76 109.75 A: i'm like totally weight conscious he's like um 

110.14 112.07 A: forty five pounds overweight 

111.73 112.39 B: (( yeah )) 

112.11 113.47 A: [laughter] 

113.06 125.25 B: hey it sounds like we're married to the type of man [laughter] i know i run on a treadmill every night like for about two miles and he's upstairs with the remote control in his hand with a bowl of popcorn and i'm thinking what is wrong with this picture [laughter] 

114.77 116.78 A: [laughter] 

124.13 125.35 A: (( yeah i )) 

125.46 128.02 A: i mean my daughter and i we walk 

128.25 131.88 A: every day for miles with the dog and stroller and 

131.23 132.53 B: yeah 

132.86 134.96 A: well my husband works late though too so 

134.84 136.31 B: yeah that makes a difference 

135.16 146.88 A: don't give him give him too much hard time um but yeah i think you've got to look for things in common but your attitudes do change over time so that's important most important i think that you just get along 

137.52 138.70 B: yeah and he 

142.85 143.78 B: yeah 

144.33 145.33 B: well just like 

146.51 157.25 B: yeah and that's you know that's true and of course you i think you need to have you know some things in common or you would never do anything as a couple and then you would start to drift apart 

155.65 156.60 A: right 

156.80 157.77 A: right 

157.32 158.54 B: and um 

158.66 167.10 B: but you know it's funny my husband con has five there's five he has five siblings and i'm an only child and so we just definitely 

167.22 171.07 B: you know did not see well did not come from the same type of family background 

170.03 170.72 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

170.73 174.33 A: same thing here my husband's an only child and i'm one of four 

171.55 172.67 B: and 

173.96 185.94 B: see and he wanted like one child that's it and you know i wanted this huge family because growing up he had all these brothers and sisters had to share had to get along and me i only you know had myself [laughter] 

179.05 180.12 A: (( [noise] )) 

180.39 181.59 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

182.04 182.61 A: [noise] 

185.26 186.97 A: yeah and you 

187.01 187.83 A: think 

187.85 190.82 A: being an only child's probably not the best thing right 

191.09 195.70 B: it's okay you know it has its advantages as i get older i think um 

195.99 204.44 B: you know it'll only be me to take care of my parents as to where you know if you have lots of brothers and sisters you would hope they would share the responsibility 

198.75 199.84 A: right 

203.36 204.75 A: right right 

204.61 212.49 B: but as you know as as i get older i i'm starting to change on how wonderful i thought an only child was growing up [laughter] 

211.85 216.95 A: yeah my husband's an only child and he says he wants several children [noise] because 

217.44 221.74 A: he was very lonely growing well he was also he didn't have any cousins or 

220.19 221.06 B: yeah 

222.24 231.09 A: and i mean i have like twelve cousins and then [noise] you know i was related to half the town i grew up in [laughter] because i come from a big italian family 

228.65 229.68 B: yeah 

231.27 232.43 B: yeah 

232.16 233.14 A: (( so [noise] )) 

233.81 242.91 A: um you learn a lot from each other too and i think that if you don't always [noise] if you don't get to learn about learn things new every day about each other that that kinda 

236.15 237.08 B: yeah 

241.09 241.97 B: mhm 

242.95 244.96 A: stales a relationship too 

244.85 248.29 B: yeah yeah because there are things that you know i get 

248.62 256.22 B: that attracted me to my husband because we did have differences and he was more of an adventurous type person and 

256.17 262.98 B: um you know like likes to go boating likes to travel and growing up we never went boating my mum was terrified of water 

262.86 274.74 B: we never traveled because we never had money and so that you know those things that you don't have in common tend to attract you and so now i've seen how i've changed now i practically live in the water and 

264.22 267.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

274.48 275.46 A: yeah 

274.82 283.80 B: during the summer time i can't imagine not having a pool or a boat and love to travel i swear when i was younger i hated it it's that's the way i was raised 

281.27 282.46 A: yeah 

284.18 286.28 A: yeah it's definitely um 

287.45 293.31 A: that you find that you like things that you never thought you would if you get someone who's a little bit different than you 

290.45 291.38 B: yeah 

293.12 294.79 B: yeah that's true 

293.66 296.52 A: but you also have to have those things in common or 

296.22 297.30 B: yeah 

296.67 303.34 A: like um i never ever watched a baseball game [noise] in my life before my husband and now i'm like fanatic 

300.03 302.52 B: yeah [laughter] 

303.20 304.17 B: yeah 

303.81 305.46 A: (( so i uh ))

324.50 326.47 B: yeah it's a cool city 

325.65 338.98 A: i mean we live in the suburbs so it's it's we don't [noise] it's not quite the same as living we lived in town for a while and it's quite different [laughter] in the suburbs with your own little isolated world 

327.05 328.01 B: yeah 

336.30 337.39 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

338.80 339.84 B: yeah 

340.07 341.31 B: that's for sure 

340.81 342.58 A: [noise] the traffic is miserable 

342.48 347.75 B: oh gosh especially on days like today it's like you just don't even want to go anywhere it's bumper to bumper [laughter] 

347.10 350.00 A: yeah is it like that in chattanooga too 

348.19 349.09 B: yeah 

349.70 362.43 B: no i mean we have good days and bad days i mean ours is only like at certain times of the day and then even then it doesn't take you forever to get from one side of the town to the other but chattanooga's a lot more um 

362.44 364.08 B: more of a um 

363.91 365.64 A: (( like a tourist town huh )) 

365.26 369.89 B: yeah it's more of a tourist town it's smaller than atlanta so it doesn't have a lot of the 

370.38 376.21 B: the you know [mn] trying to think what the right word is it um it's more of a a family 

376.23 382.41 B: a lot of people are related to one another and you've still got your home town businesses that you know 

378.69 379.79 A: yeah 

381.85 384.45 A: [noise] well i grew up in buffalo so 

384.84 386.76 A: that's how buffalo is too 

386.28 387.32 B: yeah 

387.54 388.63 A: but um 

388.49 394.00 B: so my gosh one is a christian and one is jewish how in the world do you get through that [laughter] 

391.27 392.81 A: (( yeah )) 

393.75 400.44 A: um well we have our sunday fight when i go to church [laughter] because i never did before we got married 

396.39 397.43 B: yeah 

400.09 401.16 B: yeah 

400.65 402.27 A: and um 

402.85 410.01 A: he doesn't really practice religion at all he doesn't go to church or temple or anything 

405.67 406.59 B: mhm 

409.55 410.68 B: yeah 

410.11 413.74 A: it really the the really like um 

414.62 417.76 A: sore point is how we raise our daughter 

417.38 418.57 B: yeah 

417.95 419.05 A: because 

419.58 423.75 A: it was a non issue when we got married because neither one of us did anything 

423.33 424.46 B: yeah 

424.28 431.49 A: and even when we had our daughter it was kind of a non issue because neither one of us were doing anything but after she was born i'm like oh maybe i should start going to church 

431.23 432.36 B: yeah 

431.94 433.53 A: and so 

434.07 437.52 A: um and my dad and my stepmother 

437.55 441.49 A: are very devout christians so 

442.23 448.10 A: i was brought up with it and then i went away from it and came back to it and he hates it 

445.77 446.73 B: (( mhm )) 

448.23 455.37 A: 'cause he just doesn't have a good perception of it and that that was tough in our relationship with the whole 

450.46 451.47 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

455.88 463.79 A: do we do church because our daughter gets to go to church kind of thing we still haven't come to any kind of agreement on it so 

458.62 459.46 B: yeah 

463.38 464.33 B: yeah 

464.39 468.95 A: i mean she goes when he doesn't want to wake up in time to watch her when i go so 

468.20 469.17 B: yeah 

469.82 473.38 A: (( but that's definitely a big thing you've got to look for [mn] )) 

473.13 475.81 B: yeah because and you know when um 

475.99 480.57 B: when we got married i mean we were both my family you know we were 

480.93 486.84 B: matter of fact we met in sunday school and we started dating on a church retreat 

486.72 497.58 B: or kind of started getting interested in one another on a church retreat and you know my family and his family both went to the same church and and so that never that was an important factor for me 

498.01 501.31 B: but it just it's one of those things that just worked out 

501.00 502.04 A: (( yeah i- )) 

501.55 507.32 B: and i mean i can't even imagine i mean that would be so hard so hard 

506.77 516.69 A: it is it is very difficult and i think that's one of the biggest money and religion are like two of the biggest breaking points for relationships i think 

513.74 514.67 B: yeah 

516.16 517.33 B: yeah 

517.14 522.56 A: i mean there were many a time when we were planning our wedding where it was like all right we're gonna just not do this 

522.11 523.70 B: (( yeah )) 

522.63 524.85 A: because of like his mother 

525.23 537.21 A: pushing pushing pushing for a jewish wedding and my dad pushing pushing pushing for a christian wedding and then we ended up getting married by a justice of the peace because we couldn't get anyone to agree on anything 

527.81 528.89 B: mhm 

531.46 533.16 B: (( yeah then you )) 

536.77 537.90 B: yeah 

538.04 539.23 A: so 

539.55 543.38 A: and then of course money you need to know what kind before you 

543.47 547.58 A: get involved with someone for life you need to know what kind of life they want to lead 

547.17 553.15 B: yeah and what type of baggage that they're gonna bring into the relationship to me that was important too like former 

549.20 551.10 A: yeah 

553.01 566.35 B: date you know people that he had dated i mean it's like was you know was like he this type of person that just you know dated anybody and everybody or were there some standards were there like well i'm not gonna date you because 

555.49 556.25 A: uh-huh 

563.09 564.46 A: yeah 

566.40 571.95 B: and so that kind of you know plays an important factor too i think in what you 

570.60 572.29 A: mhm 

572.18 573.17 B: look for 

572.55 574.81 A: oh yeah definitely i think 

575.11 579.28 A: i think that is more fore women than for men too 

578.29 579.24 B: yeah 

579.23 589.13 B: 'cause you always hear i don't know if you ever h- hear james dobson but he's always saying you know never date anyone that you don't think or plan on marrying because 

582.62 583.73 A: mhm 

587.84 588.74 A: right 

589.11 594.63 B: sometimes you know you end up falling in love and then you come into this marriage with this tremendous 

595.08 599.89 B: you know problem if it's not if he's a christian not a christian or if he's
