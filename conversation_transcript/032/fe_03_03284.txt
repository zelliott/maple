51.86 52.66 B: (( right )) 

54.02 54.85 B: (( [noise] )) 

56.90 69.76 A: um at the beginning versus even now uh he was very honest uh trustworthy um we had like the same things we thought were important um 

59.81 60.89 B: wow 

68.78 70.57 B: mhm 

69.77 80.71 A: you find that person and you do whatever you can to keep that person with you you know you'll go through a lot of issues but you just learn to work it out 

76.10 77.29 B: that's right 

80.41 89.99 B: that's right well you're we're complete opposites aren't we [laughter] i mean i'm a a year and a half married um i got married when i was thirty

92.78 93.75 A: okay 

93.55 103.86 B: and uh my husband was thirty when he got married too and i'd say just thus far it's been wonderful and i don't think it's gonna get any worse 

97.02 98.01 A: uh-huh 

101.00 102.02 A: uh-huh 

103.98 112.87 A: well [laughter] i was eighteen when i got married of course we dated like uh two years now

108.96 109.85 B: uh-huh 

113.00 119.90 A: my dad was a little concerned 'cause you know my husband was already out of high school you know he thought sixteen and nineteen was just a 

119.98 122.92 A: horrible age difference but it's not really 

122.93 127.13 A: um but i got married right out of high school 

126.95 133.99 A: and uh a lot of people you know that i even have known from the past have already gotten married and divorced 

126.97 127.92 B: wow 

133.80 148.26 A: because they got married so young but but we're an exception to the rule it's wonderful that first year 'cause you're honeymooning and all that but i will tell you there will be problems no matter what anyone tells you 

135.90 137.07 B: mhm 

142.08 143.02 B: yeah 

147.74 149.57 B: i know well we've already

151.34 152.59 A: uh-huh 

153.09 155.19 A: uh-huh oh 

154.28 155.13 B: (( um )) 

155.17 161.64 B: so we're enjoying that and just you know of course parenthood brings about new uh interesting 

161.72 164.97 B: aspects in a marriage and i would say just 

165.02 172.79 B: for me it's it's been wonderful 'cause he actually shares the responsibility it's not just all me taking care of him it's 

172.20 173.28 A: yes 

173.11 177.51 B: he actually you know really helps out and realizes how it's not easy 

177.12 187.70 A: no it's not we have three sons 'cause we were married a while before we had our first one because we had some problems there we were probably married 

185.95 186.81 B: (( [cough] )) 

187.72 196.97 A: uh gosh we were married eight years before kevin came along we have we have three sons kevin uh will be twenty two in august 

191.51 192.41 B: wow 

197.06 203.83 A: and then brian will is nineteen and then i still have one at home shaun will turn thirteen 

203.65 204.87 B: oh my goodness 

204.15 205.54 A: saturday 

205.55 216.44 A: so we have two that were close together and then we had some space in there and 'cause we were married for a while before we had the first one because we had a lot of issues as far as w- wanting to go on trips and 

216.40 221.27 A: he was going to school and working i was going to school and working and you know we just didn't have time 

221.54 223.05 A: to have children 

223.06 227.09 B: so what besides honesty has gotten you this far 

226.90 229.75 A: uh my husband has 

229.83 232.89 A: so patience it is unreal 

232.46 233.95 B: [laughter] 

233.32 244.57 A: he has to have a [laughter] lot of patience to you know there's just times we all have our moments and i do you know he does everybody does but sometimes you kind of call it 

240.39 241.34 B: mhm 

244.81 255.72 A: butting heads on issues or different topics like you know i think we should do this no i think we should do it this way raising the children i mean just there's different things but he 

255.90 264.24 A: he is a sweetheart he has put up with a lot he has a lot of patience for not just me and the boys but just basically for everybody 

264.06 265.39 B: that's wonderful 

265.13 266.04 A: yeah 

266.07 276.02 A: honesty he's very trustworthy and he just sticks it out and that's what you want with your lifetime partner somebody you'll share 

268.88 270.07 B: mhm 

276.02 287.22 A: a lot of interests with through good times bad times we're been through sickness we've been through when we've had a lot of money we haven't had a lot of money 

282.40 282.96 B: (( [mn] )) 

287.30 295.31 A: no children then children just there's you know there's so many issues but that's the purpose when you get married that's it 

289.60 290.87 B: right 

295.47 296.25 B: well 

295.91 297.99 A: until death do you part so 

297.69 302.56 B: i agree and one of the things that i think is key for us is our faith 

302.62 303.90 A: faith that's right 

304.15 305.01 B: faith 

304.79 307.32 A: faith in the lord jesus christ you bet 

307.04 313.16 B: just sharing that is probably [noise] what you know [noise] sorry i'm in a store 

313.18 321.74 B: um but i mean that has just really been when we can [noise] a family that plays together stays together truly what we believe in so 

321.00 330.76 A: right right uh i know when we first were married we didn't have too much of spiritual i i would say i probably have more spiritual than what he does 

330.63 331.67 B: mhm 

330.69 336.19 A: now now he was born he was born and raised in a christian home 

336.09 350.92 A: um his mother had to raise he and his sister because his dad passed away when he was four and his sister was six and his mother was a very christian lady raised him that way but i think he said there was a point that 

342.58 343.88 B: mhm 

347.91 348.88 B: mhm 

350.80 352.08 A: he was 

352.38 355.06 A: forced to go to church so much 

354.42 355.31 B: [noise] 

355.49 367.80 A: that i guess he had a burnout is what you would call it but uh i he was saved at ten but i think here the last few years he's had a lot of health issues so therefore 

357.78 358.71 B: right 

359.07 359.97 B: mhm 

367.38 368.19 B: (( [noise] )) 

367.82 382.31 A: i think he's thinking more about that and it seems to me that he's handling things a little different than he had in the past and myself uh i i've come to know the lord and love him even more now than 

370.33 371.11 B: right 

381.92 382.92 B: mhm 

382.33 394.77 A: what i did in the past so that i would definitely agree helps with all kinds of problems he just trusted him and it seems like they've they will work their way out eventually he has his way of letting you know 

392.64 393.70 B: that's right 

395.00 399.53 A: what should happen and what shouldn't happen if you kind of stay on the right track 

399.23 400.64 B: exactly 

400.00 401.06 A: yeah 

400.95 405.67 B: so honesty and and trustworthiness and faith 

404.20 405.57 A: trust in the lord 

405.62 406.55 A: faith 

405.80 406.64 B: faith 

406.83 411.61 B: and and gosh i would just those if you have those then i think you've got everything 

411.32 412.97 A: yeah and 

412.00 413.67 B: that's just my opinion [laughter] 

413.08 418.10 A: yeah uh well i have to a hundred percent agree no matter what other people tell you 

418.23 425.50 A: you know uh not everything works for everybody i mean couples just have their own issues that they deal with and what 

424.93 425.98 B: mhm 

425.62 427.25 A: what works for us 

427.34 430.72 A: may not work for you and i think what's helped 

430.67 439.51 A: uh me out as well i've proven that you can still be married for thirty years later even marrying at a 

439.44 452.22 A: at a early age of eighteen because i i look back now i think god i was really young and my husband was young [laughter] you know and here we are we're still together and i think it proves that you just 

446.59 447.51 B: yeah 

452.18 461.51 A: you just have to work through all the issues and don't try to give up so quick like everybody else does yeah 

458.83 466.50 B: exactly you have to be you have to be willing to just hang in there and the tough times are gonna come but you try to get 

465.25 469.27 A: yeah they come they come but they go as well 

469.14 470.08 B: mhm 

469.17 483.22 A: and i think mine helps because i was raised i had a a very strict father but but my parents were married uh dad passed away in two thousand and one but they'd been married let's see 

472.49 473.06 B: (( [noise] )) 

474.23 474.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

474.85 475.76 B: mhm 

476.52 477.66 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

480.83 481.75 B: oh 

484.30 486.68 A: gosh fifty four years 

486.72 487.79 B: my goodness 

487.26 488.17 A: yeah 

488.60 492.17 B: and that helps because you saw that growing up and you know 

489.43 490.28 A: yeah 

491.87 493.16 A: yeah that's true 

492.66 494.62 B: that's the way it should be [laughter] 

494.01 503.61 A: yeah uh that my sister and myself are still married to the our original husbands like ours will be thirty years and then her's 

503.63 509.28 A: let's see i think in march gosh there's was thirty two or thirty three 

509.13 510.30 B: oh my goodness 

509.76 515.48 A: now i can't say that about my brothers but you know my sister and i have followed 

515.72 526.85 A: mum and dad's standards once you're married that's your lifetime partner you try to love each other which at times is difficult [laughter] but you know you just try to l- 

517.63 518.91 B: mhm 

520.44 521.47 B: right [noise] 

525.55 526.65 B: (( [noise] )) 

526.91 530.96 A: love each other your children grow up too fast so you know you just 

531.14 539.99 A: you try to love them the best you can and when you have a partner that helps you out it makes a world of difference 

540.09 541.46 B: yes it does 

540.79 548.60 A: it it really does because there is that one point my husband traveled a lot so he wasn't around to help when the boys were little 

548.44 549.49 B: [noise] oh boy 

549.12 554.79 A: and you feel overwhelmed i guarantee you you feel overwhelmed and 

551.96 553.11 B: mhm 

554.07 557.44 B: i feel overwhelmed right now and he's helps me [laughter] 

555.40 556.30 A: yeah 

556.46 558.04 A: yeah uh 

558.03 570.12 A: it it seems hard when they're little you know you think gosh are you know are we ever gonna get to sleep through [laughter] the night and this but once they start growing up so fast you think thinking back you 

559.58 561.57 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

570.07 573.39 A: well you know that wasn't so hard after all 

570.90 571.70 B: (( [noise] )) 

572.75 574.42 B: yeah exactly 

573.81 582.08 A: you know you wait till they become that teenage that pre teen and then on up and you think gosh i wish they were little [laughter] again 

578.23 579.25 B: (( [laughter] )) 

581.80 583.13 B: exactly 

582.45 583.62 A: but uh 

583.74 590.52 A: yeah there's just you just tough it out because if it's important to you 'cause you can never find 

590.61 595.87 A: another person like the persons you're married to you you know if you think you might 

593.59 594.59 B: mhm 

596.02 597.23 A: you won't 

597.11 599.89 B: yeah and they should be your best friend too 

599.23 599.95 A: your best
