53.48 57.81 B: yeah yeah i think well it's important that 

58.01 63.17 B: um we have common interests i think that's the most important thing um 

62.19 64.02 A: (( the common interests )) 

63.40 69.36 B: common interests like you know we have the same values um the same interests 

69.43 76.36 B: [cough] in you know what what our hobbies are or whatever those are very important because um 

76.65 90.48 B: you know those those things you know sometimes when you're together then you don't feel like you're making a sacrifice because oh i don't want to do what he wants or he doesn't wanna really do what i want it's good to have both people doing 

90.50 101.00 B: what they both want and it's easier to communicate when you have you know the two parties are on the same page in terms of um 

101.68 102.28 B: [lipsmack] 

102.24 112.64 B: you know what their values are like you know do you think family is important or you think career or do you think making a lot of money is important i mean it's important uh you know if if one person thinks 

103.92 105.08 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

112.49 124.29 B: having a a big career and being successful is very important and the other person just thinks wow i'm happy with a little bit and as long as i have a family then it's not perfect you know 

123.20 128.07 A: mhm mhm so you st- i think it's up to everyones character right 

129.29 130.90 A: y- you see what i mean 

130.29 131.65 B: mhm mhm 

131.42 132.23 A: well [lipsmack] 

132.33 138.41 A: as i see every person has his his or her own personality 

138.03 138.93 B: uh-huh 

139.73 149.09 A: um so i think it's really depends on the real two peoples who will stay together i agree with you that it's very important for 

149.26 155.38 A: for for these two to have to have some at least some common interests 

154.77 156.63 B: mhm mhm 

156.37 161.53 A: i don't know if you you can you you cannot ah simply get along with each other 

160.13 161.06 B: right 

161.12 161.94 B: right 

161.71 169.00 A: but as for me i think um what i'm looking for is like like i- as for myself 

168.57 169.75 B: (( mhm )) 

169.08 172.47 A: what i what i think is the most important thing is like 

172.93 175.72 A: does she really cares for you 

175.41 176.81 B: mhm 

177.13 186.06 B: well that's a given right i mean i assume that when you're if you guys are gonna be life partners or getting married or something like that 

184.60 185.56 A: mhm 

186.44 201.22 B: that's automatic i mean if the other person doesn't love you they wouldn't want to get married and you don't want to marry them so i mean i think that's already sort of yeah i mean everybody assumes that their they love you i mean for the right reason not for the wrong reason [laughter] 

189.63 190.85 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

201.17 201.88 A: but 

201.25 202.22 B: you know 

202.03 204.52 A: yes but 

204.74 205.70 A: um 

205.96 210.72 A: to my understanding i think that you know 

207.26 208.16 B: mhm 

211.08 220.38 A: only love is not [mn] i mean [noise] love is is going not solve all the questions for y- for for the family for these two peoples 

218.41 219.30 B: mhm 

219.72 220.77 B: mhm 

220.61 221.64 A: (( i think )) 

221.60 229.04 A: love is n- not the only answer but i think it's it's the most important one that she will care for you and you 

228.85 238.24 A: you will care for her because once you can really get get i mean get at you now from from the other half then 

230.37 231.27 B: right 

238.45 248.53 A: i think maybe you you doesn't have too much you d- you don't have too much interests common interests with her or w- with with the other half but 

245.64 246.54 B: mhm 

248.63 251.50 A: you can you can growing 

251.73 254.09 A: (( um how does it you can )) 

254.16 256.93 A: you can get some some together 

255.61 256.56 B: mhm 

256.66 260.55 B: right i mean a- as time goes on you can kinda have two 

257.26 258.04 A: yeah 

259.02 271.35 A: for example h- he's not he's not going to the football but you do- you don't like that but certainly if you if you really love him maybe you can go along with him 

264.65 265.58 B: uh-huh 

270.48 272.05 B: (( mhm )) 

271.74 275.06 A: [lipsmack] you you can i mean get used to this 

274.44 277.54 B: [sigh] yeah but i think it's easier 

277.14 278.23 A: mhm 

277.65 280.92 B: okay it's easier for both people 

280.72 282.04 A: (( h- how mhm )) 

281.17 287.68 B: that if if if you have the same interests like if i like football i mean i happen to love football 

287.41 288.29 A: uh-huh 

287.51 300.57 B: and so it's not i don't have to force myself to really like it even b- just because i love him i think it's just easier that way i mean just like you [noise] for instance if 

293.03 293.90 A: uh-huh 

294.87 295.81 A: uh-huh 

298.46 299.36 A: uh-huh 

300.39 305.58 B: let's say you have a woman who [sigh] oh i don't know um [lipsmack] 

305.00 306.31 A: (( likes dance )) 

305.91 306.63 B: huh 

306.44 308.22 A: who who like a dancing 

307.75 312.04 B: who like dancing right okay and you you don't like dancing at all right 

312.02 325.31 B: and you like okay just make her happy i will force myself to l- to to dance and you're not really happy but if you find somebody that yeah they also like dancing and you like dancing or she 

317.04 318.03 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

324.20 327.21 A: that'll be much more easier uh-huh 

325.32 329.77 B: then easier right i mean yes you you h- you should have love but 

329.19 330.11 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

329.83 338.03 B: you know sometimes i don't think [mn] just think of it this way if y- let's say friends right when you make friends when you make friends 

334.73 335.57 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

336.09 337.03 A: (( mhm )) 

338.07 344.20 B: y- y- your friends how you make them you by common interest right you would not never make friends with

355.04 358.96 B: in a in a in a in a marriage relationship that person
