88.37 89.31 B: right 

89.56 90.66 B: right 

90.69 97.14 B: yeah i think that's one of the things about life partners is you're guaranteed to be spending a lot of time together so 

96.80 101.83 A: yeah yeah i'm actually divorced yeah 

97.78 98.56 B: (( um )) 

99.66 100.54 B: are you

113.32 114.67 A: (( yeah )) 

114.08 116.30 B: oh that can break things down for sure 

116.88 122.01 B: my husband and i were apart for three months after we got married and that was real tough because we got used to being apart 

122.35 124.68 B: and then we had to get used to being together again 

125.45 126.51 B: and ah 

128.12 130.72 B: i don't know [laughter] we made it though 

130.34 131.66 A: yeah 

132.70 133.55 B: um 

134.37 137.41 B: let's see so what else [laughter] 

138.33 142.11 B: [noise] ah are you calling from new york you sound like you have an east coast accent 

141.41 143.31 A: yeah i'm c- new york 

142.76 144.22 B: oh i'm in texas 

144.94 147.35 A: ah i know some people down in texas 

146.68 148.51 B: (( oh yeah )) 

148.64 151.00 A: [mn] that i was in the military with 

152.28 153.70 B: you were what 

153.00 155.31 A: uh when i was in the army 

154.74 155.78 B: (( oh okay )) 

156.01 157.76 A: (( [cough] and )) 

158.36 160.49 A: so back to the topic that's 

159.96 166.52 B: [sigh] right s- back to life partners [laughter] um [lipsmack] what do you think is a good way to meet a life partner 

166.46 167.67 A: um 

168.85 170.65 A: many different ways 

173.11 174.91 A: talking to people 

175.47 177.80 A: going out on dates 

179.19 183.04 A: you know seeing if you connect on different levels 

184.86 186.90 B: i would agree with that 

188.22 192.32 B: [noise] my husband and i were introduced by mutual friends and i think that that really helped 

192.40 193.66 B: us to ah 

194.25 196.69 B: i don't know i thought that that was good because we ah 

196.81 202.67 B: had similar interests and liked similar types of people and that worked out quite well 

202.13 202.94 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

202.84 205.90 B: um we're we're very similar in a lot of ways 

205.97 206.83 B: um 

207.57 216.90 B: you know just in types of hobbies we like to do and it just we like to do although um professionally we do very different things and think very differently um 

217.09 219.22 B: i guess that doesn't really matter since 

219.64 223.14 B: you know we we each like to do our own thing in fact it gives us our own space 

222.81 224.56 A: yeah 

224.74 228.41 B: so hopefully it'll last [laughter] it just seems like it's going to 

233.98 236.41 B: so anyway let's see [laughter] 

237.20 239.46 A: [noise] back to the topic 

238.43 241.56 B: back to the topic of life partners 

241.72 244.46 A: um have to be able to trust them 

244.30 246.24 B: you do have to be able to trust them 

245.86 247.33 A: (( yeah )) 

247.68 252.71 A: because if there's no trust in a relationship then there can't be a relationship 

252.11 253.27 B: right 

254.71 256.45 B: right 

257.00 257.90 B: um 

258.59 261.02 B: i think you also need to respect each other 

260.15 262.71 A: [noise] [noise] yeah 

262.74 264.38 B: i think that's also very important 

263.65 267.28 A: [noise] respect each other's space 

266.97 267.86 B: right 

268.75 271.00 A: you know 'cause once in a while 

271.78 274.31 A: you don't feel like being around anyone 

275.60 276.56 B: right 

276.98 279.92 A: you're just in your like your own little world and you 

280.35 282.57 A: (( don't wanna really be bothered )) 

282.01 282.85 B: right 

284.50 285.50 B: right 

294.93 297.17 A: (( well this is a weird topic )) 

297.08 299.02 B: this is a weird topic 

299.08 302.31 B: it's kind of hard to think of of ah you 

303.18 308.07 B: know once you're coming up with things it's trying to it's hard to figure out where to go from there 

314.60 318.90 B: [sigh] yeah i think also with life partners you really need to find somebody who ah 

320.71 324.70 B: you can support through difficult times as well 

324.08 325.43 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

325.96 327.73 B: i know some people who ah 

328.23 336.83 B: their relationship didn't work out because one of them was going through a tough time and the other one just didn't really seem to to be there for them 

336.62 343.05 A: yeah like my fiancee now she's going through a rough time i'm always there with her 

340.62 342.38 B: mhm 

343.21 347.41 A: she's been in the hospital for a couple of weeks here and there
