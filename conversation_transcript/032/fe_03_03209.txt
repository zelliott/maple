55.70 65.27 A: yeah [noise] definitely [sigh] unfortunately he's also the biggest of 'em [noise] he's r- really this bi- you know this big lumbering [sigh] kind of slow thinking cat so 

64.89 66.45 B: [laughter] 

65.44 71.97 A: [mn] he likes to play [noise] in ways that the other two cats don't necessarily find playful [sigh] about

85.94 86.91 A: yeah 

87.48 98.94 A: [sigh] no they still don't really [sigh] get along very much but they've [sigh] you know [noise] gotten used to each other to the point where they're not it's not a constant battle anymore in the house they can hang out together and relax a little bit [noise] [mn] [noise] 

98.09 99.86 B: just kind of deal with each other huh 

99.28 106.34 A: yeah [mn] but o. and sid like to once a day or so get into a big fight and chase each other around [sigh] [noise] 

105.80 107.92 B: (( [sigh] [noise] sounds like you're a happy cat family )) 

107.55 122.18 A: yeah it seems like they consider that fun even without willing you know admitting that it's fun you know in that sort of cat way [noise] you know they're being territorial but they're also goofing off because they're [sigh] they're not really hurting each other they're just kind of [sigh] smacking each other a little bit [noise] so [laughter] 

112.68 114.12 B: [laughter] [sigh] really 

114.59 116.18 B: (( they're just toying with each other )) 

121.37 122.78 B: playing a little bit huh 

122.26 123.58 A: yeah 

122.98 129.74 B: yeah [sigh] well that's um i only have one cat so [laughter] no dogs [sigh] um 

126.61 127.69 A: gosh huh 

130.20 136.04 B: [mn] probably just spend the same amount of time you do but it sounds like you have a little more you know a more time i'm not sure but 

135.33 144.34 A: i work from home so it's easier for me to kind of spend time where the cats are just hanging out of my lap or you know poking around and giving me trouble so 

137.04 137.94 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

143.37 147.03 B: no they're spoiled [laughter] they've got somebody with them all day long 

144.85 146.27 A: yeah yeah 

146.85 148.58 A: [laughter] yeah 

147.82 157.81 B: [sigh] yeah mine ah she's h- home by herself quite a bit [noise] and so we get home in the evening and then in the morning and then she's out the door she stays inside all day so 

157.49 158.80 A: (( [noise] [noise] gotcha [noise] )) 

158.68 165.34 B: [laughter] um so um just a quick question off the subject d- do you do mystery shopping at home [noise] 

164.13 167.02 A: do i do most of my shopping from home [noise] 

166.29 169.27 B: no no mystery shopping how did you find out about the fisher project 

169.12 175.55 A: oh um i found out about it via a friend of mine who's actually sort of a research associate on the project 

174.98 176.19 B: oh okay 

175.64 181.30 A: and she's [sigh] [noise] sent some email around trying to line people up to get involved [noise] so 

176.88 177.93 B: interesting 

181.08 183.27 B: what is it they're studying exactly 

182.77 183.94 A: what's that 

183.31 186.30 B: what is it that they're studying exactly with this 

185.67 198.26 A: um it's all i know is that m- my friend is a linguist and so they're not really studying the my understanding anyway is that they're not really studying the content of what's being discussed so much as how it's being discussed [sigh] 

189.73 191.26 B: (( uh-hum )) 

197.92 198.93 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] oh )) 

198.09 208.96 A: like they're you know they're just gonna [sigh] like the first conversation that i had was all about a [sigh] u- um you know like sports and whether or not people are being paid too much and things like that 

208.35 209.38 B: (( uh-hum )) 

208.97 220.00 A: and i mean i can't imagine that they're you know they're drawing any s- serious connection between like what's being talked about they're just [sigh] depending i don't know we might be completely derailing their experiment by having this conversation 

214.13 216.42 B: [noise] right right just more 

218.24 219.93 B: [laughter] 

219.99 221.38 B: (( yeah we've done that for )) 

220.95 226.45 A: that's what they get by introducing completely random elements like people like us into the [noise] into the net 

223.65 225.36 B: (( 'em there you go )) 

225.59 233.75 B: [laughter] [sigh] there you go [laughter] [sigh] so pets ah well what was what was it just a how important they are or how much time we spend with them 

228.96 229.96 A: yeah 

233.63 241.59 A: yeah ah well i think both i they're definitely pretty important they're all pretty important to me i [noise] cinnamon we know is like on her last legs i mean 

240.68 241.71 B: [mn] oh no 

241.53 249.42 A: she's just you know she's very elderly and she's just not quite likely to [sigh] to last a lot longer so we've kind of taken to 

249.43 259.83 A: um you know prioritizing making sure she's comfortable and ah they think she's got some kind of stomach cancer and we're not really willing to put her through you know any kind of 

253.21 254.27 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

256.72 258.24 B: oh no [noise] 

259.96 270.20 A: chemotherapy or any of that kind of stuff 'cause it's not gonna add that much to [sigh] you know her lifespan or her quality of life at the end of her life so [sigh] 

266.52 267.92 B: yeah 

268.93 272.41 B: it might do her more harm than good so 

270.79 280.20 A: yeah exactly so we're just kind of [noise] making her comfortable and doing the best we can she's a v- very very sweet cat that's the problem [sigh] [mn] 

279.56 281.64 B: mm that's sad 

279.99 288.90 A: that's you know it's [sigh] the you know when the other cats pick on her and they think they're playing and she just can't keep up you know and that's there's not much you can do about that [noise] 

288.08 291.52 B: [noise] [sigh] yeah so so do they seem less sensitive to her 

291.16 295.78 A: they don't really well i mean she hides from 'em a lot of the time [sigh] um 

294.26 295.40 B: oh okay 

296.08 309.74 A: and they've kind of worked it out so that [laughter] if she's on the bed the bed is off limits for fighting in any way shape or form and i i don't know how they all you know come to these agreements but [laughter] they seem to have y- you know 

306.64 307.63 B: [laughter] 

309.72 312.18 B: they don't take it there huh [laughter] 

310.73 312.42 A: yeah exactly 

312.22 313.48 B: [laughter] 

312.68 314.88 A: (( i wouldn't know why but [noise] )) 

315.46 324.16 B: that's funny [sigh] i um the only um company my cat has is a neighbor cat that likes to come in at nighttime and eat her food 

323.80 325.14 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

324.25 336.75 B: [sigh] he'll sneak in [noise] you hear the screen door shut and he'll come up and she'll be peeking round the corner at him looking at this big grey cat that's our neighbor's cat [sigh] and he's just chomping away at at the food that she's left and she has that look like 

334.80 336.01 A: oh 

336.18 337.25 A: [laughter] 

336.63 349.98 B: you know you guys need to come and do something and now you know [lipsmack] [sigh] and then we'll go and you know go get up and shoo him out and then she'll follow us in or kind of run out the screen door after him and kind of smack him a little bit like yeah and 

338.71 340.11 A: right 

349.77 356.43 B: get out of here and don't ever come back [laughter] it's kind of funny because she hangs out with him but she doesn't want him coming inside the house eating at all 

351.36 352.36 A: wow 

355.96 358.71 A: (( well sure [noise] yeah that makes a lot of sense [sigh] )) 

357.36 358.34 B: yeah 

358.44 361.26 B: cats are funny like that [sigh] but this 

360.34 363.75 A: yeah i thought i had thought for a long time that if i 

364.21 369.12 A: had like a big fenced in yard it would be good to get a dog [noise] like 

368.42 369.88 B: (( [noise] uh-hum uh-hum )) 

369.13 374.94 A: not [noise] i i'm p- pretty particular like we had dogs growing up we didn't have cats until i was in high school 

374.51 375.80 B: (( uh-hum [laughter] )) 

375.31 377.47 A: and i kind of felt like [sigh] 

377.41 386.09 A: i'm not into the [noise] big slow stupid dogs so much as i i had a friend who had a beagle once and he had it o- out on his property [sigh] 

385.62 386.56 B: uh-huh 

385.99 398.71 A: and ah this was a really smart smart dog that would [noise] follow you round and learn from you you know take direction wasn't trained to be a pain he didn't slobber all over people all the time and 

388.67 389.25 B: (( [noise] )) 

397.90 398.88 B: (( mm uh-hum )) 

398.67 404.19 A: and it's hard to underestimate the value of a dog that actually isn't sort of in your face you know 

403.54 405.39 B: [noise] [lipsmack] right 

404.53 411.45 A: so i really kind of enjoyed that [sigh] so i could do that it'd be nice to be able to introduce a dog to a cat at the same time i guess 

410.88 413.90 B: yeah yeah 

411.64 414.17 A: but it's a little late for that so [laughter] 

414.18 416.03 B: or you just bring a new kitten in 

415.92 418.47 A: yeah that's true yeah [noise] right [noise] 

416.59 418.14 B: [laughter] 

418.99 420.65 B: you know [noise] break in the other cats 

420.55 422.71 A: yeah i wonder how the ah 

423.24 427.68 A: [lipsmack] the current cats would take a kitten being introduced into the situation 

427.49 428.56 B: mm 

427.89 430.33 A: it'd be kind of like a target it seems like 

430.20 432.09 B: [sigh] maybe the dog would protect 

432.25 435.31 B: (( it who knows [sigh] that's a tough one [mn] )) 

432.50 434.66 A: (( [noise] [lipsmack] who knows yeah [noise] )) 

435.33 436.36 A: [laughter] 

435.37 441.97 B: yeah you either way you always you hear stories where people say that their cat and dog get along so i don't know 

440.84 442.18 A: (( [noise] yeah yeah )) 

442.42 443.81 B: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

444.18 445.58 B: but thirteen [laughter] 

446.05 451.32 B: that's my husband making dog noises but ah [laughter] um 

447.77 448.99 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [laughter] )) 

452.28 460.54 B: ah speaking with ah your cat that's thirteen years old i have ah my grandparents had a cat and so ah it wasn't a purebred or anything but it was just a regular 

460.66 466.96 B: [sigh] tabby for nineteen years so but it looked nineteen years old so 

463.05 463.97 A: (( [lipsmack] wow )) 

467.06 468.34 B: i don't know if your cat looks 

467.22 469.74 A: and they can actually last that long that's 

469.23 473.54 B: yeah if you could imagine you know and they were and stuff like that [laughter] 

469.75 470.69 A: pretty 

470.94 472.28 A: (( pretty far out oh [noise] )) 

474.55 477.67 B: so [mn] okay [laughter] 

476.54 478.52 A: well that's good to know i mean 

477.99 482.79 B: it sounds like your yours are really important to your family almost like children it sounds like 

482.14 492.38 A: well that's the thing too [noise] we've like decided we're definitely not having children and so [sigh] that's kind of where we're focusing you know [sigh] but we've also gotten so [sigh] 

487.20 488.22 B: [sigh] you 

492.39 497.03 A: selfish that we've decided you know when these three um 

497.36 509.62 A: [lipsmack] you know once the two [noise] that we've got kind of pass on we're just not at all [sigh] interested in even getting additional pets like it's like a theoretical thing but [sigh] we're so selfish about our time we're really busy 

506.95 507.94 B: yeah 

509.76 514.54 B: it's hard though after you get 'em it's you can't imagine not having them you know 

509.78 510.64 A: (( you know )) 

513.69 517.89 A: yeah and and i guess that's true we'll have to wait and see what happens when we ah [sigh] 

518.09 521.34 A: when we a- actually lose all of our kitties but [laughter] [noise] 

520.65 522.67 B: (( yeah it's a tough thing [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

523.48 527.86 B: [lipsmack] well i don't know where we're at in the call but i think it's coming to a close 

526.15 531.24 A: yeah it seems like we ought to be bumping right up against ten minutes and y- yet they haven't called it off 

529.71 530.83 B: (( i think so )) 

531.47 533.38 B: (( no i think unless they're putting it )) 

532.33 539.62 A: ten minutes is a long time to have a complete you know just a random conversation about a topic the urge to to wander just is crazy 

537.08 537.77 B: (( yeah i )) 

539.34 541.63 B: i know are you is this your second call 

541.13 543.67 A: it is it is although 

542.18 544.41 B: [sigh] was it easy go ahead 

543.74 545.81 A: [noise] no go ahead 

544.98 550.94 B: [sigh] the last person i talked to was easy because they just kept yelling and i didn't really have to say to much but [laughter] 

549.33 557.82 A: gosh ah yeah see the last one we were lucky 'cause w- if you [sigh] it was a sports call and if you get two people who are into sports 

557.24 558.25 B: (( uh-hum )) 

557.89 563.65 A: sports people can talk forever about sports and i happen to be a b- you know a baseball fan and she was [sigh] 

560.17 561.14 B: yeah 

563.54 574.82 A: she was a football fan who liked baseball and so you know she was in a baseball town and i'm in a baseball town and we were able to just go on and on and on and on and i think we still probably wandered a little bit but it was all sports related at least 

565.87 566.81 B: (( uh-hum )) 

572.46 573.33 B: (( uh-hum )) 

574.29 575.65 B: oh wow that's 

574.89 576.78 A: (( [sigh] so you know it was )) 

576.86 578.72 A: [sigh] it was a lot easier to do 

578.91 580.73 B: (( good oh that's pretty good [laughter] )) 

579.84 584.04 A: [sigh] 'cause i mean how much you know can you say about your pets after a while [noise] 

583.39 585.45 B: just that you love 'em to death and they're 

584.69 586.61 A: yeah exactly 

585.76 587.64 B: (( a pain in the butt sometimes )) 

587.69 588.50 B: um 

587.79 591.13 A: [laughter] well the other thing is that we're so late [sigh] i mean we've 

591.41 599.90 A: with our cats we've switched like we hav- you know we're so lazy [sigh] we're lazy on the one hand about chores but it's because around the house but it's because we're e-
