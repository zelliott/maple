207.14 208.50 B: (( [mn] )) 

208.42 209.12 A: just 

208.67 211.19 B: because i really do like animals mm 

211.00 218.78 A: yeah i love them you know a lot of it is also that um 'cause i had another roommate that [sigh] had to move out 'cause she had a golden retriever

233.17 234.45 B: (( uh-hum )) 

233.58 242.31 A: except we had this huge dog and a really small patio and eventually it just seemed too much of a problem [sigh] and she ended up um buying her own place 

242.55 249.14 A: um just so that she could keep her dog but it's like [mn] it's a lot of responsibility especially um 

249.18 254.00 A: you know if you're young and you have a lot of other things going on it's like having a child you know [laughter] you 

253.72 256.02 B: oh yes yes that's for sure 

254.02 261.72 A: have to feed it take care of it it's expensive so that's p- part of the reason why at this point my dog's not living with me 

261.57 263.00 B: (( mm mm ))

286.91 301.40 B: you know fun just kind of petting it and [mn] then it actually followed us too and i thought oh no what if it's going to follow us home but i guess it just went [sigh] to the ah [mn] to the end of the street an- and then it went back again [laughter] it was just like it's 

300.25 301.20 A: yeah 

301.93 309.67 B: it's just so nice i i just i really like those dogs that's the kind of dog i would want to have [mn] if we would ever get a dog

335.25 349.95 A: cookie shaped like a shamrock and he went in to the dining room and climbed up on the table [sigh] and ate the whole thing and he's notorious for doing that she'll bake cookies and he'll go in and he'll get up on the table and he'll just pick off rows of the cookies at a time [laughter] 

342.07 343.36 B: oh my [noise] 

349.02 350.24 B: oh boy 

349.74 359.98 A: he'll eat all kinds of stuff he's so funny [sigh] and occasionally he'll take himself for a r- run on his own occasionally he'll get out and he'll go r- run down the dog beach and we'll go down there and catch him on the beach playing 

352.28 353.14 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

360.00 364.13 A: you know mischievous like that but he's a pretty good dog he's very friendly

369.69 375.39 A: [lipsmack] i don't know if i guess i've had a couple of other dogs i've never had a cat i'm super allergic to cats so we don't 

374.62 389.22 B: oh oh yeah i know my sister in law she's allergic to cats too so they'll never be able to have [sigh] any cat either [sigh] you know it's kind of too bad [sigh] 'cause my sister she has ah cats so if they ever go and visit [sigh] um 

376.02 376.96 A: (( have them in the house )) 

382.37 383.35 A: yeah 

384.38 385.21 A: (( yeah mm )) 

388.98 396.33 B: then the cat has to be put away in a special room and they have to ah vacuum clean and and just make sure that there's nothing 

396.19 408.39 B: anywhere on the couch or or on the r- rugs or anywhere [sigh] 'cause otherwise my sister in law she breaks out and then she's just sneezing and [sigh] i think she might get a kind of rash or something too so 

405.40 406.34 A: yeah 

407.98 419.77 A: i i've a very similar reaction yeah first it's just like sneezing and my eyes water and then my throat starts closing up and i start wheezing and i break out in a rash and it it's horrible [sigh] so unfortunately i 

417.64 418.51 B: mm 

419.69 430.31 A: i've never been able to have a cat but my brother used to have so he used to have a huge saltwater tank [sigh] he had all kinds of pets when we were kids and he had b- birds and he had a tarantula and [sigh] 

427.31 428.14 B: (( mm )) 

430.07 431.80 B: oh my [laughter] 

431.47 438.50 A: strange pets [laughter] yeah he was always coming home with something new and i was okay i was always like a- afraid of half of it [sigh] 

438.59 439.91 A: (( but um [lipsmack] )) 

440.54 443.56 A: i think those are the only pets that i've ever had [laughter] 

442.97 445.06 B: (( uh-hum yeah [sigh] )) 

445.42 456.58 B: yeah well [lipsmack] it's basically f- for me it's been basically yeah cats or kittens when we were younger and also once when i was living with a roommate [sigh] she was 

456.56 464.56 B: um taking care of some kittens for [sigh] a friend so but ah yeah that was quite a while ago already [laughter] 

464.40 465.33 A: yeah 

465.55 473.33 B: [mn] and i'm just looking forward to the day when we get our own place and then [sigh] we can have as many [sigh] pets as we want [laughter] 

472.52 473.52 A: yeah 

473.37 474.61 B: [sigh] 

473.61 475.89 A: (( yeah i know it's definitely nice )) 

476.37 483.32 A: to have 'em around my um boyfriend right now his roommate has a dog as well [sigh] um [mn] [noise] 

476.41 477.37 B: yeah 

478.31 479.23 B: (( uh-hum )) 

483.48 484.68 A: and 

484.68 498.52 A: but for the most part i really like dogs this particular dog whines a lot so [laughter] he's one of the only pets that i've ever met where i'm like oh man i can live without that pet he just whines constantly if he's not getting attention and it's like 

489.78 490.52 B: (( [laughter] )) 

492.35 493.30 B: (( oh )) 

498.34 502.18 A: [sigh] worse than having a kid you know not much fun at all 

498.53 499.34 B: (( mm )) 

500.35 501.76 B: yeah 

502.33 504.78 A: so it's kind of a pain it's a pain because 

505.30 512.48 A: [mn] when mike is almost gone the dog's whining you know and and you pretty much can't do anything about it so 

512.46 523.01 A: [sigh] and mike doesn't understand because you know when the dog when he's around the dog's fine [laughter] but there's nothing that you can do you just have to live with it it's part of having pets 

517.24 518.62 B: (( uh-hum )) 

521.37 522.57 B: yeah 

523.09 527.74 B: yeah i guess that s- some dogs are more prone to that than others and you know 

526.98 534.41 A: yeah yeah i think a lot of it's just in the training you know if if you train your dog from the start to 

534.64 543.74 A: behave a certain way and the dog you know the dog's going to understand but you really i think it's really important to [sigh] really maintain the way that you train a pet 

544.06 550.77 A: without you know risk the chance of the pet later being a pain in one way or another 

544.15 545.54 B: (( uh-hum )) 

550.82 553.51 B: [sigh] yeah yeah that's true yeah 

553.16 554.03 A: (( [sigh] [cough] mm )) 

553.83 568.23 B: i know that ah my sister they live um [mn] up in northern b._c. and they have some [sigh] w- wonderful dogs they have great pyrenees i don't know if you've heard of those but those are [sigh] big white dogs [sigh] and they're they're very nice they're actually 

563.64 564.58 A: (( i have )) 

566.05 567.19 A: right 

568.44 582.47 B: [mn] i mean they're good they can be good as guard dogs but they're also family kind of [sigh] dogs like they're good around kids they're actually quite gentle [sigh] they're strong but they're actually quite gentle and they're just [sigh] oh when we were up there v- visiting [sigh] 

582.32 594.88 B: i guess it was last summer it was just [sigh] i really enjoyed being around those dogs it was funny though because one dog when we first came there [sigh] she right away put up her paw that was kind of and then she kind of pushed toward us and my sister said well 

594.71 599.95 B: if you don't want to pet her you just push it away 'cause that's how she would kind of l- let us know that
