2.96 5.27 B: hello my name is sharon 

5.02 6.19 A: hi sharon 

5.94 6.75 B: [laughter] 

6.22 8.54 A: um okay so uh 

8.19 10.55 B: is this your first or your second call 

9.79 11.44 A: this is my second 

10.92 12.13 B: mine too 

11.63 15.16 A: yours too [laughter] i wonder if they do that on purpose um 

12.28 13.37 B: mhm 

14.96 16.85 B: i don't know [laughter] 

15.79 17.95 A: (( [laughter] )) 

18.12 21.97 A: i think the most important thing is probably 

22.70 24.06 A: uh 

24.52 26.42 A: the loyalty 

26.59 27.94 A: yeah 

28.19 29.43 B: loyalty 

29.25 32.19 A: everything's all set okay thank you sorry 

32.40 34.13 B: loyalty did you say 

33.40 35.42 A: yes absolutely 

35.16 38.07 B: oh i think uh maybe uh a 

38.74 40.15 B: sense of humour 

39.98 42.68 A: mm that's very important too i agree 

42.11 45.70 B: and uh like backgrounds i mean 

45.71 46.32 B: (( b- )) 

47.73 52.31 B: the you know same type of c- culture outlook on life uh 

53.10 54.50 B: things like that 

54.79 63.02 A: um i don't feel that culture is necessarily important i do think that um being a 

63.01 71.44 A: religious person myself i feel that um if you have any sort of strong belief that it's necessary to find somebody in that same belief system 

71.52 72.77 B: mhm 

72.08 79.54 A: so um so as culture is a is a strong belief for you i could see how that would be important but in [noise] general i don't 

73.32 74.34 B: (( they just )) 

79.43 81.76 B: well i've been married three times 

79.65 80.89 A: i believe 

82.00 82.97 A: okay 

82.11 90.89 B: [laughter] okay and the thing of of all of them the thing that the the one passed away and him and i had a very 

88.79 89.89 A: (( i'm sorry )) 

91.07 94.17 B: good relationship but we both had the same 

92.22 93.26 A: yes 

94.21 96.18 B: we both had children 

96.17 103.68 B: we felt children were important we were family oriented so when i say cap- culture i guess what i really mean is uh 

98.10 99.09 A: right 

103.65 117.66 B: the same type of priorities and wh- what you consider important and things like that and you know and it was fa- family we w- w- were from important to us the same outlook and 

107.49 109.41 A: [noise] yes 

109.63 110.87 A: yes 

118.06 119.47 B: uh just 

119.70 122.78 B: the way that we l- viewed the world in general you know 

122.13 134.15 A: mm yes no i definitely agree with that um i think children is one of the most important things to discuss um before you get married because if one person wants them and the other doesn't it wont work 

125.06 126.06 B: (( and yeah )) 

133.67 138.56 B: well and we were blended he had one daughter i had one [laughter] daughter 

137.70 139.27 A: mhm 

138.60 140.84 B: and both of 'em were uh 

141.60 145.13 B: i would say spoiled and they were both uh 

143.52 144.87 A: [laughter] 

145.54 154.36 B: had a big mouth and so we we had to co- come to a lot of well how did you know and so it was when it was her his daughter 

146.82 148.09 A: oh goodness 

153.72 154.92 A: [noise] 

154.46 159.84 B: that was his priority when it was my daughter it was my priority [laughter] yeah 

157.68 162.11 A: right [laughter] so that worked out well for you guys then 

160.97 165.81 B: yes yes it really did sometimes i s- used to think oh 

162.56 164.28 A: [laughter] 

165.88 169.93 B: we'd no sooner get out somewhere and we'd get a phone call [laughter] 

168.93 171.47 A: oh great [laughter] 

170.65 174.41 B: because they were both teenagers at the time and so 

173.48 178.21 A: okay [laughter] those teenagers always in trouble [laughter] 

174.51 176.37 B: and and we got our 

177.29 181.72 B: right well and they always needed a ride or need picked up or 

179.71 180.60 A: (( [noise] )) 

181.74 184.08 B: something in that area so 

183.21 184.37 A: right 

184.24 191.47 B: and i i learned i didn't complain when he had to go get his daughter and he didn't complain when we had to go get mine [laughter] 

190.82 195.49 A: [laughter] so that's a good understanding [laughter] 

192.48 193.51 B: and so 

193.89 197.81 B: yes we had a understanding about the family you know the 

197.42 198.66 A: (( right [noise] )) 

198.05 201.84 B: and and that because you had those responsibilities you know 

201.87 207.47 B: so that's the reason if we hadn't been able to laugh at it it might have been a different story [laughter] 

205.74 207.54 A: [laughter] 

207.78 209.16 A: oh goodness 

208.57 213.78 B: [laughter] but other than that way th- th- mainly i think that 

213.92 224.00 B: we had like i said we just had our the same outlook 'cause i mean there was uh on a lot of things you know and so i i i consider that important 

223.34 231.55 A: yes i definitely agree with that um when you said culture i had thought you were re- um referring to like uh you know black or white or 

225.71 226.52 B: (( yes )) 

230.37 233.37 B: black or white or uh italian or 

232.92 234.20 A: right 

233.43 237.74 B: n- no 'cause [laughter] i'm scots irish and he was polish 

237.09 239.70 A: [laughter] that's an intermingling 

239.25 241.03 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

240.75 245.58 A: so um but yes i definitely agree that um that that would need to be 

245.73 248.88 A: on the same th- especially the children aspect 

248.43 252.88 B: right yeah and other than that i i really 

253.06 257.72 B: humour uh and loyalty like you said i i i agree with that too 

256.91 257.87 A: (( mm )) 

257.92 260.79 B: uh that all kinda goes into 

261.74 269.04 B: f- family values and things you know that because you if you're not loyal if you can't depend on 'em forget it i 

263.30 264.62 A: right 

268.73 272.25 A: yeah exactly and where will they be when you need them then 

269.27 270.05 B: (( mean you know )) 

271.91 274.47 B: they're usually not there [laughter] 

273.27 276.88 A: yeah and times in marriage can be very difficult 

276.51 277.46 B: yes 

276.92 282.07 A: so you need somebody who's going to stick by you al all those moments you know 

281.34 283.71 B: (( oh yes yes because there they can )) 

283.85 287.37 B: (( [mn] like in odd difficult times you just lean you know )) 

286.83 288.22 A: oh yeah 

288.37 292.18 B: (( and like you say if they're you can't depend on them well )) 

292.24 296.71 B: (( you then you have a problem which of course i have in the past you know so )) 

295.73 296.90 A: right 

296.96 299.71 B: (( i really appreciated him when uh )) 

300.63 302.73 B: (( i miss him because it was )) 

302.81 304.56 B: we were in our forties 

304.25 305.44 A: right

410.70 417.77 A: i got mine off line are you a computer user sharon yeah there's um there's a good site i think it's called 

413.67 414.58 B: mhm 

417.82 423.71 A: coupon finder or something if you go to google and type in coupon organizer it would come up

427.97 433.94 A: no there's a specific site that that sells the organizers so if you type in like coupon organizer 

431.35 432.57 B: oh 

433.46 434.46 B: uh-huh 

433.97 436.57 A: it should come up because that's where i got mine [lipsmack]

445.35 446.91 A: yeah 

446.41 448.62 B: so i probably could get it there

464.25 465.27 B: yeah 

466.47 468.44 B: [laughter] 

469.82 476.70 B: other than that i would say really getting back to the topic i guess y- you need someone who's your friend too 

476.31 478.07 A: mm that's good 

476.78 482.01 B: (( you know you have to have it in order to have a good relationship i mean uh )) 

480.50 481.99 A: yeah 

482.24 483.23 B: because

488.40 491.76 A: yeah it does need to start with friendship definitely 

490.70 491.50 B: (( yeah yes )) 

492.22 493.42 B: so

548.42 551.72 A: see the first time i had to put it in but not this time 

551.66 555.97 B: yeah i don't remember i think i did have to put it in last time 

555.82 559.00 A: yeah 'cause they emailed me like right before 

559.08 562.54 A: and said that they would be calling and uh 

562.72 569.70 A: and then they did call and i had to input the number they gave me in the email but this time i didn't get an email this was kind of a surprise [noise] 

563.56 564.55 B: (( too mhm mhm )) 

568.73 576.82 B: no in fact they i keep seeing on the boards where they're still asking people about it and that and i thought i had re- 

577.78 584.13 B: you know resigned up when they said and i hadn't heard anything and i thought gee i wonder if it went through 

583.88 584.89 A: yeah 

584.20 588.71 B: you know if i was going to get a phone call surveys have been so

597.13 597.95 B: (( uh )) 

598.14 599.95 B: (( sticking up a little bit maybe ))
