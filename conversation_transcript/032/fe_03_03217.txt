139.01 140.34 B: [laughter] 

141.23 154.58 B: yeah dogs are so easy to like they just keep coming back for more you know they're just so great like if i had to get a pet now i would definitely get a dog just for like company and stuff 

141.43 142.67 A: (( a little different [noise] )) 

151.37 153.26 A: yeah yeah 

154.15 163.74 A: yeah but the nice thing the only like the opposite if we had to go look at the pros and cons the nice thing about cats is that you don't have to do much with it like you have these 

162.73 164.39 B: yeah 

163.80 173.90 A: i feel bad if i don't walk him he looks all sad and everything or if you don't play with him he'll look all sad but cats like that's cool you know he'll just chill out and do whatever 

170.31 170.90 B: (( [noise] )) 

173.71 187.61 B: yeah [laughter] yeah um dogs you feel like when you come home like they've been waiting for you to come home like all day but cats are just like you know i've been busy like i've got stuff to do like 

175.04 175.98 A: (( [laughter] i mean )) 

187.64 190.60 B: forget you [laughter] so 

188.72 193.38 A: [noise] yeah um you're home okay yeah could you feed me please yeah 

192.75 200.47 B: yeah [laughter] um do you live in an area where you get to like let your dog out and stuff or 

193.93 195.41 A: (( [noise] so )) 

199.53 202.93 A: i i have a big fenced in yard and so 

202.21 203.55 B: (( oh that's cool ))

205.63 206.60 B: (( mean )) 

205.81 220.69 A: and he's this little dog so the the best part is i've got a whole bunch of neighborhood dogs that a lot of my neighbors don't put their dogs on like a leash or not a leash but you know any type of chain so they just kind of wander around sometimes 

220.56 222.33 B: mhm 

221.37 234.45 A: and i guess my dog you know he's a little midget dog and um he thinks he's big stuff because he's behind basically the fence but if he wasn't behind the fence he'd be getting beat up quite a bit i'm i'm supposing 

224.62 226.08 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

232.31 233.66 B: [laughter] 

234.45 236.70 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] ))

287.32 290.04 A: yeah i mean like could you live without him 

289.47 295.96 B: oh well um [lipsmack] well see we live on a farm in florida my parents and um 

294.35 295.08 A: mhm 

296.33 308.16 B: uh so it's like really and it's surrounded by woods and stuff so it's really wild you know like we have a lot of wild animals that come up and this one time um like a few months ago actually my dad 

301.68 302.70 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

308.06 318.46 B: saw a florida panther like around the yard and my cat was on the deck 'cause he's like an outside cat kinda like a farm cat and um the 

311.05 312.29 A: (( [noise] )) 

314.37 315.05 A: (( [noise] )) 

315.17 316.06 A: right 

316.39 317.18 A: yeah 

318.44 322.68 B: my cat started running down the driveway we have this real long driveway 

322.59 336.07 B: um to get away from the bobcat or the florida panther i mean and the panther like took off after my cat and like chased him down the driveway and um and tucker didn't come back for like 

336.01 344.91 B: you know like four days or something so we thought that he was dead like we just you know it was really sad and i was so sad and cried and like 

344.77 359.72 B: you know i mean whatever like i got over it in a couple of days i guess and i was like moving on [laughter] with my life but like yeah i was really really sad and then like four days later he just came back and he was really skinny and like freaked out but 

350.58 351.65 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

358.98 360.12 A: [laughter] 

359.73 370.00 B: he was fine [laughter] so i guess he just like ran away and ran really far or something i don't know what what he did on his little adventure but 

370.02 381.02 B: but he turned up okay so yeah it would be hard to live without him i guess but because i don't see him very often and you know it doesn't it's not like a constant reminder i guess right 

380.02 382.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise] sure )) 

381.95 383.82 B: right sure [noise] uh what about you

384.03 384.73 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

384.08 398.77 A: [noise] uh i i could live without him but i mean i would of course i like living with him but uh there's a point like i have a when i first i had him and i got a house and so i had him here and i uh my parents came up and gave me a puppy 

398.79 406.72 A: and uh the second day of having my dog winston and this puppy he just he l- he got up and he couldn't walk 

398.96 399.67 B: (( mm [noise] [noise] )) 

406.81 409.64 A: like he just lay there and so we were freaked out and we 

409.65 422.11 A: rushed it to the veterinarian's office and everything and you know i'd already had the thing is i was like i'm not paying it's expensive to take a dog to the to the you know the vet so
