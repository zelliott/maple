249.48 250.55 B: right 

249.55 259.04 A: [sigh] i guess unless you're an athlete and you do that stuff all the time or you're really into it you know it's just i guess it depends on what you you know your life situation is [sigh] 

258.83 259.99 B: (( uh-hum )) 

259.54 260.59 A: so 

260.64 264.21 A: now are you like out of school or are you still in school

282.25 284.90 B: accident that i had about five years ago so 

284.16 298.55 A: oh really see that's what happened to me too i got [sigh] from falling when i fell you know how when you fall [mn] my feet went up in the air and i came down on my hips [mn] and because it was black ice you know what that is the guy i talked to before i've been called twice tonight have you

320.50 321.54 B: oh wow 

323.90 333.72 A: [noise] they wouldn't [sigh] so of course none of it's covered under workman's comp and i didn't have any of it before [sigh] but i take b. six [sigh] and that really really really helps it [sigh] 

334.28 348.83 A: for some reason that and coral calcium they really seem to help 'cause i i went through the fact of going through all the drugs the doctors put you on any everything [sigh] and i never was a a person that liked to be on a bunch of medicines anyway if you know i'd rather take vitamins and stuff like that you know 

346.04 347.02 B: (( [sigh] uh-hum )) 

348.78 356.01 A: [sigh] and so i'm now finally o- off of all of 'em except for ah the vitamins that i take and then my blood pressure pill is the only 

355.91 367.30 A: pr- prescription drug that i take [sigh] but man they after i got when i got diagnosed with fib- fibromyalgia they had me on [lipsmack] so many things and i mean there's just s- so many bad things that it does to your body [sigh] you know 

367.75 373.88 B: yeah my mother had fibromyalgia and i think they put her on drugs initially and they made her kind of depressed 

367.75 368.71 A: that 

370.23 371.32 A: oh does she 

374.50 382.57 A: oh they just do all kinds of i mean i was just so tired i couldn't like lift my head hardly [sigh] and they just have you so drugged up and everything you know [lipsmack] 

376.04 377.00 B: (( [sigh] )) 

382.39 383.57 B: (( uh-hum uh-hum )) 

383.17 384.29 A: and ah 

384.50 390.42 A: [sigh] and i i'm supposed to be doing all these exercises and it was like i hurt so bad i could even hardly m- m- move 

390.43 404.63 A: but the um since i started taking that i don't know if you've heard of any of those commercials on t._v. or not but that coral calcium stuff really works good [sigh] you might want to tell your mom to check it out if she doesn't take it because it r- really has made a difference in my pain level [sigh] [sigh] 

396.06 396.91 B: (( [laughter] )) 

404.38 405.33 B: okay 

405.07 414.66 A: 'cause it was absolutely excruciating before i there was no way excep- unless i was in the water i mean you know when i when i did the um arthritis exercises in the water at the y. 

414.80 422.73 A: that was good but that's because you know with the water and the gravity thing [sigh] but to try and do a whole bunch [laughter] 

419.25 420.13 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

422.66 433.58 A: all by yourself like at home or something like that forget it you know it just i i couldn't do it [sigh] but i forced myself to go out and walk because [sigh] i know if i don't th- i hurt more [sigh] 

427.96 429.01 B: (( uh-hum )) 

434.12 435.23 B: (( uh-hum )) 

434.64 437.22 A: does your mum have to have that same thing too 

437.97 440.94 B: [mn] um i she's actually she's on 

441.88 444.89 B: as well she was in a bad car accident 

444.47 445.52 A: (( uh-hum ))
