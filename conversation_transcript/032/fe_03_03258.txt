0.07 3.38 B: hi [mn] my name is david i'm from florida 

3.88 6.68 A: hi my name's josh i'm from boston 

6.72 10.54 B: boston oh little ah a little north huh 

7.99 8.99 A: yeah 

10.08 11.60 A: yeah a lot north 

11.50 13.31 B: a big dig right 

12.72 15.72 A: oh it's still going on i think 

14.78 17.51 B: uh i i know i heard about that 

16.44 19.95 A: billions of dollars later [laughter] billions of dollars later 

19.76 23.06 B: [lipsmack] so have you ever done these surveys before 

22.66 25.40 A: yeah this is my fourth one i think 

24.96 31.98 B: that's good i've done a few of them myself and and the topic of the day is life partners what do you think is important 

27.23 28.09 A: yeah 

31.69 40.28 A: ah personally i think h- humour is is i don't know if it's the most important but i think it's one of it's very high up there 

40.31 46.75 A: because i kind of like to make jokes a lot and if people don't laugh at them i get kind of mad sometimes [laughter] 

45.52 51.70 B: [lipsmack] [laughter] well i also think that i- in a life partner you need to have trust and honesty 

51.26 53.52 A: (( [mn] of course of course definitely )) 

52.36 64.67 B: you know with trust and honesty the ah harmony falls into place and actually ah people get along better and it's more of an effective communication that people can relate to each other better 

57.25 58.07 A: (( yeh )) 

64.55 71.64 A: right yeah what i've also noticed um as much as well though is that i think [lipsmack] both people 

72.09 77.10 A: need to sort of also i also i mean i guess when i'm looking for 

77.16 92.11 A: ah my girlfriend or wife later on it would be sort of they also kind of have to know the monetary side of of a relationship as well like i don't i don't think it makes much sense to have one person just handle finances and one person to just you know be a housewife or whatever 

91.91 96.19 B: [noise] [sigh] you know it's it's a mutual aspect where with financial 

96.00 107.91 B: ah positions it's important you know that you do discuss things because you don't wanna to offend one partner versus the other and make a decision that might be regretful in the future 

107.84 116.59 B: um also also that when you believe in mutual aspect of communication things run a little bit smoother 

108.37 109.72 A: right right 

116.69 120.92 A: oh yeah i definitely agree with that but a lot of times though 

116.92 117.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

121.03 124.50 A: that can be that can get into some trouble [laughter] 

124.13 126.48 B: sure absolutely you know um 

124.74 126.49 A: an- i mean 

126.47 136.54 B: i've been ma- i've been married before and one of the important things about me being married is directly having a mutual aspect of you know communication like i said before 

128.50 129.29 A: yeah 

136.23 137.10 A: yeah 

136.51 143.13 B: but also that you you learn to agree and not to bicker on small things 

142.42 144.97 A: yeah i think that's very important 

143.17 145.90 B: and you learn to adjust on life that way 

145.56 149.74 A: yeah exactly very good i like it ah 

150.08 153.29 A: [lipsmack] let's see so are you married currently right now or 

152.72 159.70 B: i'm married now i've been married four years i have a four year old s- a three year old son well i'm trying to make him grow ol- grow older than he is 

159.08 160.72 A: very good 

160.22 163.71 B: and um i was married previously for eighteen years 

163.13 165.15 A: really interesting 

164.08 176.77 B: yeah and one of the things is that in a relationship you need to learn to be positive and not to be negative and to compromise you know when you learn to compromise things get ah [noise] 

169.31 170.28 A: right 

173.28 174.18 A: (( right yeah )) 

176.79 181.69 B: [lipsmack] like if it run a little smoother and people learn to agree a little bit more 

180.99 182.67 A: yeah that's true 

181.81 187.20 B: and it's important to that um have are you married or are you ah in school 

185.86 196.24 A: no i um i'm actually single right now i'm only twenty three years old so which i guess which i guess is still considered old to be ah not not be married [laughter] 

189.58 191.23 B: (( oh okay and i'm )) 

193.98 195.19 B: well i'm actually 

195.80 197.74 B: i'm actually double your age 

197.66 198.93 A: really 

198.39 202.83 B: yeah a lot of people say i sound a lot younger than i am 

201.99 203.46 A: you sound younger 

203.30 206.72 B: well a lot of people say they think i sound younger than i am i'm forty seven 

203.48 204.38 A: or 

206.47 209.81 A: yeah yeah you don't i wouldn't say you were forty seven 

209.91 212.64 B: no i i i grew up in new york and ah 

211.92 212.95 A: okay 

212.68 216.26 B: moved to florida in ah huh twenty years ago [noise] 

215.49 217.33 A: where do you live in florida 

216.85 226.03 B: in fort lauderdale which a lot which a lot of people fort liquor-dale because there's a lot of partying and drinking there's a lot of ah things but it's 

218.01 218.94 A: (( oh okay )) 

223.75 226.30 A: really never been there before 

226.10 231.79 B: oh well f- in florida it's nice it's usually warm all the time right now it's about ninety one degrees 

231.07 232.15 A: wow 

231.90 239.20 B: and most of the time you don't have to wear pants you can wear shorts all the time [sigh] you only will have to about h- you only have to worry about hurricanes 

234.56 236.44 A: yeah that's great 

236.58 237.69 A: [laughter] 

239.28 243.42 A: right and the humidity it gets pretty humid down there in florida doesn't it sometimes in the summer 

242.01 250.41 B: depending on what part of florida um in the north part of florida it's more humid because it's not as close to water even though there is water there 

244.33 245.25 A: okay 

250.01 251.27 A: (( right yeah )) 

251.19 257.30 B: but other than that um i've done several surveys and ah i think this is a good topic because 

257.09 268.87 B: when people learn to get along with each other harmony sets into place and that also um you learn you learn a lot about people you know people in marriage basically you still learn no matter how long you've been married 

268.25 269.34 A: yeah 

268.76 274.92 B: uh and it's important to be like that [lipsmack] um ah were you you have a girlfriend [lipsmack] 

274.95 282.15 A: no not currently no i i had one a couple of months ago but it didn't really work out too well and now i'm single again 

282.53 286.66 B: okay but you keep on trying and being positive things will work out you know 

284.34 285.45 A: oh yeah 

285.57 287.61 A: oh yeah i definitely ah 

286.97 289.02 B: have you always lived in boston 

288.82 299.24 A: ah no i grew up in connecticut i ah went to undergrad in boston then i was out in l._a. for grad school and now i'm back in boston actually working yeh 

295.91 297.35 B: (( oh okay do )) 

297.51 300.42 B: you like it better do you like it better on the east coast 

300.37 310.79 A: yeah i do i definitely like it better i mean there's some very nice parts of california like s- santa barbara and san diego but i i just didn't like l._a. that much i was in l._a. 

311.01 315.89 B: ah well as as you've done the surveys before you'll know that they're very prompt with the payments 

311.51 312.49 A: and i 

315.75 317.01 A: the what 

316.44 318.08 B: prompt with payments 

318.73 322.10 B: have you got any payments yet from them 

320.74 328.16 A: [mn] no no i don't think i don't think they decide the winners until the survey ah until the whole information gathering sessions are over 

328.21 333.23 B: oh because i i did three of them already and i've gotten one pay cheque so far 

332.64 334.12 A: are you serious 

333.55 335.36 B: yeah 

334.36 336.53 A: for ten dollars or whatever it was or 

335.71 339.21 B: yeah ten dollars yeah 

336.54 338.62 A: (( that's great i haven't got one )) 

339.48 350.61 B: so it's small things but the main thing is learning to get along and learning to know about people in all the different parts of the united states i haven't got any calls from overseas i don't know if they do that overseas but 

349.71 352.64 A: yeah yeah i don't know about that 

351.07 352.00 B: but 

351.96 365.32 B: it it's good and you'll h- you'll have fun and um you you learn a lot about people and that's the most thing is that you know different parts of the united states p- people relate different thing with relationships as well as ah having a partner whether it's 

365.23 370.70 B: ah female or male or anybody depending on what you know what's what's in your best interests and what's in your needs 

367.00 367.90 A: right 

370.35 371.15 A: yeah 

370.63 382.49 B: and a lot of people look at it as only one sided where you have to be open minded and that's part of a relationship is that as long as you're open minded in any type of relationship then er that's where the harmony really sets in 

382.48 388.34 A: very true so but okay so question though so how do you sort of 

388.41 398.72 A: if you're too open minded from the outset you may get involved in a relationship which you as a person don't really feel comfortable in with isn't there sort of 

391.37 392.22 B: right 

397.46 400.78 B: right well you can you can also be very vulnerable that way 

400.57 401.51 A: yeah 

400.60 401.55 B: but you know 

401.55 405.53 B: and but the main thing is you know w- which is the right side and which is the wrong side 

405.53 417.93 B: but with experiences a- as you get older and you will find out that w- what is right and what is wrong and that's i guess part of i guess getting older and maturing and all those facets of it 

417.71 423.15 B: is that when you learn and when you know the right partner's there you'll know based on the past experiences 

423.07 435.16 B: and that's part of relationship is that when you finally find the true person you really want to be with you have known basically based on your experiences is that how you want to communicate with somebody how they should communicate with you the respect issue 

434.72 435.68 A: right 

435.07 439.33 B: and to treat you the same way as you want to be treated them 

437.71 442.41 A: yeah that's i can agree with that that's a good axiom i like that [laughter] 

440.25 452.96 B: yeah good um usually after about ten minutes normally ah we just disconnect the call directly and i don't unfortunately stay on because i gotta take care of other things i work out of my home 

452.48 453.96 A: oh what do you do 

452.83 465.36 B: and i actually i [mn] can't say on the phone unfortunately due to compliance regulations but i previously worked for american express for about nineteen years but i've been in customer service for about twenty five years 

457.05 457.93 A: okay 

462.35 463.33 A: (( oh wow )) 

464.67 465.62 A: that's great 

465.58 474.92 B: yeah and ah you learn to talk to people and and my wife says um you know the way i t- treat people is that i can probably end up selling the brooklyn bridge to the same person twice in the same day 

475.04 476.23 A: [laughter] 

476.49 484.96 B: you know because i like talking with people and you know the main thing the main thing is that now what i do is i i'm on my own i'm more or less like an independent 

478.33 479.40 A: that's good 

484.69 485.54 A: right 

484.83 499.49 B: so when you when i do this and i communicate with other people i actually learn at the same time how people are and that's good is that when you start learning to talk to different people no matter where they are you learn things about life and that's part of the situation also i think with 

490.91 491.81 A: right 

499.39 505.90 B: with life partners that no matter where you are you may end up falling in love with somebody that may be outside of your area 

505.68 506.58 A: true 

506.25 510.57 B: c- case in point i met my wife on the internet and now w- we've been married four years now it 

508.85 509.81 A: no way 

509.88 512.70 A: that's that's amazing and it worked out fine and everything 

511.90 516.15 B: worked out fine she was in new york and i was in florida and ah 

514.46 519.76 A: wow was it through like a was it through like a a site or just happened to be a newsroom 

518.49 526.57 B: no just just a regular chat situation and we got involved and ah henceforth just six months later we got married and we've been married since [noise] 

520.93 521.86 A: wow 

525.90 536.05 A: that's amazing i've been hearing more and more stories about in that you know that typ- in that typical way and er and they've all been pretty successful it seems like i'm i'm surprised 

534.92 549.44 B: well i think the good thing about that is you're less inhibited [noise] in a lot of ways rather than being in front of someone because sometimes you may not know what to say and it's it's a concernable issue where actually you may be afraid to say the wrong thing or you don't wanna offend somebody 

541.24 542.15 A: true 

544.32 545.45 A: right 

549.46 550.48 A: that's true 

549.76 560.50 B: but if you're straightforward and you're honest and you're openminded all those fall into place and um i- it's been working out and i'm very pleased about it and i have a son that's the world to me right now 

560.10 561.27 A: that's great 

561.28 563.16 B: and it it will work out 

561.32 564.98 A: and that was was your son from your first marriage or or from 

564.08 569.25 B: no from my second marriage i have an eighteen year old from my first marriage which unfortunately didn't work out 

565.25 566.06 A: okay 

568.85 569.93 A: oh right 

569.16 583.39 B: and my daughter directly who is with my ex wife of course she doesn't communicate with me as her father so uh y- you get situations like that but you gotta still go on you gotta be positive and you no matter what happens in life you can't look back and think well what what if and what 

574.49 575.35 A: oh 

584.64 586.54 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

586.74 587.77 A: (( i hear you )) 

587.99 599.89 B: [sigh] all right well i i think basically that's gonna be about ten minutes now that we have spoke [lipsmack] and i if you normally wait on the line itself for any other communications but specifically i'm i'm gonna disconnect at this point 'cause
