302.58 313.96 A: allowed to have one [mn] but i don't know i think i think my pet gives me like a g- guilty c- conscience just 'cause i really feel like i don't spend enough i mean even when i lived there [sigh] i just wouldn't spend enough time with him 

313.79 315.69 B: does he remember you when you go home 

315.18 325.63 A: at all yeah [noise] he does [noise] it's really sad though because i think he feels s- super betrayed [sigh] every time and and you know he doesn't get why i'm g- gone for [noise] like six months at a time [mn] 

325.56 328.59 B: (( [noise] somebody told me that o- ))

344.10 345.70 A: [noise] huh [mn] 

346.03 347.42 A: that's an interesting 

347.40 357.62 A: [noise] c- concept [noise] i've never heard that before [laughter] [noise] that would help though [noise] 'cause i'm always like how are you not [noise] bored out of your mind [noise] you know 

352.62 353.51 B: yeah 

357.54 366.64 A: [noise] but how is that possible [noise] [mn] but if they d- didn't have that concept [noise] that would [noise] definitely help the situation of [noise] like sitting at home for hours while we go to work and 

365.82 371.64 B: right 'cause whenever you come home it's like y- you're always there to them i think 

370.33 371.94 A: right that's true 

372.51 374.52 B: i don't know if that's true or not but 

375.13 379.71 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [mn] well there's kind of sense out of that and i think recently [noise] he's just been )) 

375.30 376.58 B: maybe it 

378.93 379.76 B: (( is )) 

379.91 388.56 A: [noise] [sigh] a little more kind of i don't know i can't explain it it's like this l- look where he you totally feel like [sigh] they're totally people and they're looking at you like you know 

388.70 392.38 A: [lipsmack] that wasn't very cool what you just did to leave me like that [laughter] 

391.64 393.57 B: [laughter] and how old is he 

393.12 397.48 A: [mn] he's ah he's totally getting up there um 

397.80 401.72 A: (( [mn] [lipsmack] let's see at home since ninety [noise] )) 

401.80 403.01 A: one 

403.44 408.37 A: whoa that is [noise] that can't be right yes it is yes it is right [mn] 

406.70 409.24 B: [sigh] ten eleven twelve 

408.67 411.76 A: that's twelve years holy cow 

410.65 412.77 B: that's o- old for a dog 

412.20 415.60 A: that's really old oh my god that's really sad [noise] ah 

416.07 420.69 A: that the other day well i went home a little while ago and [mn] [noise] um 

421.06 431.62 A: (( [lipsmack] i don't know i just called him and he just kind of sat there [noise] he just kind of sat there with his head down and i was like what is going on with you and i was thinking [noise] [sigh] the man is old [laughter] he's an old man you know )) 

432.61 433.54 A: (( [lipsmack] 'cause it's )) 

433.15 434.90 B: poor guy so is he getting 

434.00 437.58 A: not l- like that anymore [noise] where you're just like come here boy [noise] [laughter] [noise] he's 

437.41 439.01 B: so he's getting deaf [sigh] 

437.93 439.01 A: (( i don't )) 

439.04 450.72 A: know [laughter] very much i guess that was kind of funny [sigh] i don't [laughter] know if he's getting deaf [laughter] but he's definitely maybe just losing energy [noise] or maybe becoming a l- little bitter like [noise] [laughter] 

450.64 458.75 A: oh now you got time for me huh okay sure i see how it is you know i'm gonna sit my arse right here [noise] and j- just do the thing 

452.54 454.46 B: [laughter] 

458.50 459.97 B: so who takes care of him 

459.82 472.77 A: [lipsmack] oh my parents which is ironic because they s- super were not the ones to be they did not want the dog and we only c- convinced them [noise] because we were like it'll be all on us you won't have to do anything you know and of course what happened was [noise] 

460.08 460.83 B: when you're 

472.76 480.12 A: [sigh] you know we were irresponsible feeders and cleaners and [noise] th- the most the majority of the responsibility fell on them [noise] [sigh] 

480.38 485.30 A: so [mn] but so now they don't have a choice because we're ph- physically not even there 

486.05 491.97 A: [noise] [mn] so now they just [lipsmack] you know they take care of him [noise] and you know that's cool 'cause they love him they have a relationship with him but 

492.61 496.94 A: [noise] [lipsmack] yeah i think there will always be that family joke like 

496.73 498.02 B: [laughter] 

497.12 500.25 A: [noise] how they basically did it all in the end themselves 

501.07 504.90 B: and so does it does it take a lot of time every day to take care of him 

501.29 502.33 A: [noise] but um 

504.17 511.68 A: it does it well not every well i think [sigh] i swear to god [noise] even when it's not [noise] t- the time it's the guilt [noise] of like 

512.28 519.68 A: [noise] if you don't walk them or you know what i mean [noise] i mean it's a dog like [noise] who kind of needs to get out and [noise] you know 

520.25 527.01 A: [noise] do stuff so we just actually moved [noise] into a much bigger house with a much bigger yard [noise] so i'm hoping he's having a little bit of fun right now [noise] 

521.14 523.40 B: (( y- yeah )) 

527.07 530.13 A: with that at least but [noise] 

528.95 531.04 B: yeah dogs need to get outside 

530.70 536.51 A: yeah dogs [noise] really really need to get outside but then [noise] who the hell has time [noise] you know 

537.29 540.52 A: [noise] i don't know i don't know but i mean you've got to make time that's the point 

541.83 549.16 A: [noise] [sigh] our house is kind of a busy house we're super hectic people and there's always people although there's always things going on [noise] 

549.98 552.92 A: [mn] so that's kind of hard to balance everything but 

553.44 557.96 A: [lipsmack] um yeah that's basically that so [sigh] what you teach full time 

558.40 560.78 B: mm i teach at yeah 

558.50 559.56 A: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] ))

565.46 569.86 A: oh right right right yeah that's the period i'm going into r- r- right now 

570.10 572.35 A: [noise] [mn] that's really scary [mn] 

571.68 574.31 B: yeah so now i have mountains of tests to grade 

574.36 577.78 A: [laughter] [mn] [lipsmack] right you're coming at it from the other perspective 

576.92 578.62 B: (( uh-hum )) 

578.10 581.56 A: (( [mn] what do you think which one do you think is worse [sigh] [mn] )) 

582.00 586.43 B: oh gosh i think you feel more pressured as a student [laughter] 

583.22 584.25 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

587.38 587.95 A: (( [noise] )) 

588.12 591.71 A: [mn] but it probably takes you hours and hours and hours 

591.10 596.98 B: oh it does it you know you don't have any appreciation for the work that goes into it until you do it 

592.33 593.43 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

596.43 597.11 A: (( [mn] )) 

597.13 599.89 B: (( do you like teaching do you like working with ))
