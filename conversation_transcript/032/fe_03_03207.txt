143.36 144.59 B: that's cool 

144.09 150.58 A: but uh they're they're sweet cats but there's a lot of inbreeding in in the cats we got 

150.18 151.19 B: uh-huh 

150.95 153.97 A: lot of inbreeding because there's 

154.28 159.60 A: in fact i don't think we have any of uh sparkle's um kittens 

159.35 160.30 B: uh-huh 

159.66 162.11 A: anymore uh 

162.14 176.31 A: she had two litters and the male the tomcat that she gave birth to is the uh mate to the rest of the family [laughter] so uh th- 

173.63 175.07 B: oh jeeze 

175.83 177.32 B: busy cat 

177.70 181.94 A: that kind of makes it interesting to say the least

181.16 182.10 B: uh-huh 

182.39 194.90 A: but uh [laughter] in fact well one of the genetic abnormalities that we've we have noticed from that is uh one of sparkle's uh grandkittens 

195.90 198.32 A: had come up pregnant 

197.89 198.86 B: uh-huh 

198.46 201.99 A: we thought it was a boy cat because he had little balls 

202.50 203.82 B: oh my gosh 

203.90 207.57 A: so i w- what do they call those hermaphrodites or whatever 

206.74 208.60 B: uh-huh yeah 

207.67 208.74 A: (( uh )) 

209.00 219.86 A: i- it was the funniest thing to see him nursing those kittens and i thought that is not a boy cat [laughter] 

215.91 218.69 B: yep it's not the way it's supposed to be 

220.44 222.44 A: (( but that a- )) 

221.90 223.51 B: that's cool 

222.58 225.34 A: after that they uh 

225.50 226.27 A: w- 

226.43 227.45 A: uh 

227.56 238.89 A: the ones that were around that time really had problems having kittens so we wound up getting the uh girls fixed and so 

233.34 235.28 B: mhm 

239.12 248.83 A: i mean it's not worth it's not worth them having troubles having kittens and the kittens dying and them dying and stuff like that 

239.26 241.39 B: that's smart 

243.84 255.96 B: right right right right no you're right no i'm a big i'm a big cat sucker i i didn't think i never thought i would be and then i wound up getting a cat like um 

256.39 265.18 B: i don't know like nine years ago and he died like uh oh four or five years later and i just i don't know i just like them they're easy to deal with and uh 

264.85 265.89 A: [mn] they are 

265.33 271.03 B: they're lovable and oh every time i see like a stray cat it's like my heart goes out to it because it's like oh or 

271.05 273.27 A: yeah well me too 

271.90 282.73 B: or you go to the pet store and you see them locked up or or you know uh i don't know if you pet smarts down there we up here they do adoptions and it's like i always feel so bad for them so 

280.22 291.05 A: mhm oh i'm a sucker for a cat in fact there there's only one cat we've ever paid money for we'd gone to um uh 

283.75 285.62 B: yeah 

290.93 295.66 A: an animal shelter this one weekend because they were having an open house 

295.45 297.32 B: mhm 

296.04 307.25 A: and we thought well sparkle that's my wife's cat we've had so long she had a dog one time and we thought well we might see about picking up another dog for her 

306.99 307.90 B: uh-huh 

307.62 320.82 A: but sparkle has to like the dog right well needless to say uh that didn't work out too well but we did stumble across a cat that really liked me and i really like him 

310.10 311.93 B: mhm 

320.40 321.32 B: uh-huh 

321.19 324.86 A: so we wound up paying money to get him out of the shelter 

324.93 329.63 A: and needless to say we didn't tell him we had twelve other cats at the house 

325.08 326.14 B: uh-huh 

329.22 331.49 B: [laughter] 

329.46 344.37 A: [laughter] but uh we wound up getting the cat and you know uh even though i like the cat and the cat liked me i think my wife gets along better with him than i do [laughter] 

341.62 343.74 B: [noise] oh that's cute 

343.89 349.18 B: that's cool that's really cool now do they do they come into the house at all or are they strictly outside 

345.16 346.35 A: (( so )) 

348.57 361.16 A: yeah they they they come in the house some but uh w- the ones that mainly stay in the house would be sparkle which is her cat she she hates it outside 

358.05 359.92 B: mhm 

360.86 362.71 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

361.39 375.72 A: i mean it's not a matter of her wanting to run she just hates it outside period which is weird most cats like running outside and then her granddaughter patch which is by far my 

365.70 367.51 B: mhm 

369.91 371.79 B: mhm 

375.93 387.11 A: the little special cat that i think the most of because she's real sweet and just real loving but she is a scaredy cat deluxe 

379.03 380.85 B: mhm 

386.72 388.61 B: mhm 

387.32 389.59 A: i mean sh- she is 

389.75 394.92 A: as skittish as they come and she's just like her grandfather 

394.62 396.46 B: [laughter] 

395.29 401.54 A: just like her grandfather looks like him acts like him the whole nine yards 

400.86 402.82 B: mhm 

401.61 410.90 A: i mean wh- when he was still around he was an inside cat but of course male cats don't make real good inside pets 

411.42 418.43 A: so we let him outside and after we let him outside well that that was the last we ever saw of him 

417.95 418.84 B: oh 

419.19 420.12 A: so 

419.72 426.67 B: yeah my cats really don't care to go outside they like to st- stare out look around but they don't like through the screen and stuff but 

426.76 432.49 B: when it comes to it they're just more comfortable just sitting inside lounging around and beating on each other 

430.25 431.17 A: huh 

432.54 437.89 A: yeah so- some cats are that way but most of them really like playing outside 

437.28 439.18 B: mhm 

437.92 439.47 A: really like it 

439.41 443.91 B: uh i would be i would get upset if i ever lost these two because 

444.00 457.18 B: i don't know they've been my buddies they've been through everything and th- they take it's so calming they take care of each other and they you know they they all they'll sleep next to each other and you know they'll play with ea- you know it's nice i know when i go away for the weekend or whatever 

456.96 463.73 B: i don't have to worry about leaving a cat alone by himself him or herself you know it's got someone uh you know another someone else here 

460.26 461.43 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

463.71 464.65 A: yeah 

463.91 472.25 B: so yeah i li- they are great i mean i i've al- i've thought about having a dog but you know i'm in advertising and and i uh 

472.48 476.63 B: i'm always on the run and and i just and that wouldn't be fair to the dog you know 

474.07 475.09 A: mhm 

476.38 478.42 A: yeah that's true [mn] 

477.58 485.72 B: plus you know taking them for walks in thirty degree weather which i don't whether you guys in louisiana get that uh that would not be fun [laughter] 

485.16 486.61 A: no no mm 

485.88 487.86 B: i would kind of hate it so 

487.95 493.05 B: but uh no i'd i i mean i've thought about getting another but the only problem i have now is 

492.98 503.08 B: my girlfriend's like allergic to cats so i don't know what to do [laughter] get rid of her or the cats and it's like i don't know it's a toss up some days [laughter] 

497.82 498.83 A: well 

500.87 507.35 A: well i usually most people when they say they're allergic they're allergic to the pet dandruff 

506.95 508.20 B: yep 

507.68 515.16 A: and uh a- as much as people don't like the idea you can give a cat a bath 

516.34 521.33 B: yeah they don't take to it too well no it's not 

517.44 525.34 A: it it's not easy [laughter] it's not easy but you can give a cat a bath and that reduces the pet dandruff 

525.53 526.96 A: tremendously 

526.38 535.62 B: yeah there's also they make something you can wipe on them that gets the dandruff off but uh i mean and and she never was a cat person before 

529.43 530.30 A: (( mhm )) 

535.63 544.72 B: uh you know she started coming over here and and my cats love her to death and they don't like anybody except me because they're just they're 'fraidy cats of everybody 

541.09 542.71 A: yeah 

544.51 550.38 A: well i tell you what the cat cats are pretty good at figuring people out 

550.11 553.34 B: yeah oh they're smar- very smart animals 

552.58 553.99 A: oh they are 

553.58 555.46 B: extremely 

555.12 561.94 A: in fact uh w- we we still marvel at how smart my wife's cat sparkle is 

561.69 562.62 B: uh-huh 

562.20 565.85 A: because has her own taste in music 

565.43 566.26 B: uh-huh 

566.03 574.84 A: she has and and i i don't know whether all cats are this way or not but she can tell colors to a certain extent 

574.48 575.37 B: uh-huh 

575.30 580.79 A: i mean she is so fond of just plain old regular blue 

580.75 581.72 B: uh-huh 

581.49 589.02 A: and she will pick in fact the reason we've even found this out in the first place was that this uh 

589.15 592.74 A: my wife had this blue lighter she carried with her to work 

592.40 594.19 B: mhm 

592.92 599.89 A: and the cat had this blue food dish well the cat had obviously picked the blue 

596.33 597.23 B: uh-huh
