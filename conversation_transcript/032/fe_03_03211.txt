59.24 62.35 B: did you have a bad experience with them when you were a kid or something 

62.26 67.37 A: [noise] yeah i got attacked by them a couple of times i know one time when i was a kid um 

67.39 76.74 A: we used to live in an apartment complex at that time and uh i got chased by a dog in front of everybody and i was freaked out and ever since then i you know 

76.71 88.73 A: every time i see a dog i kinda have second thoughts thoughts i don't want to get near it and then uh in college um we came back from a football game and uh my we were at a friend's house 

88.81 97.62 A: and uh the next door neighbor um actually we i was still getting out of the car the next door neighbor i didn't know he had a dog and a- it was actually a pit bull 

97.59 100.43 B: oh well they're scary [laughter] 

98.59 105.49 A: yeah yeah i i jumped out of the car and uh we just came out you know a football game and i was 

105.75 108.78 A: had a couple of drinks and stuff and all i see was 

108.96 114.03 A: paws on my chest and some dog's mouth about to bite my face off i was like freaked out 

114.05 122.94 A: jumped back in uh into the car and i'm like i'm not coming out [laughter] till you put that dog inside so ever since i don't know i don't like dogs [laughter] 

122.53 130.08 B: yeah if you i i think if y- like if when you're a kid if you're attacked by them i think it's like that's really hard to overcome 

130.29 138.41 B: i mean but i had nothing but good exp- like i i grew up wi- you know when i was growing up i grew up like in a suburb so i ha- i always had a cat and a dog 

138.12 139.35 A: yeah 

138.75 152.04 B: and um my dogs th- i never had more than one dog at a time but like throughout my life i had one one dog and i always had the ki- kinda dogs that would attack [laughter] other people but never our family 

152.03 152.77 A: (( wow )) 

152.09 160.68 B: um well no a- actually like when i was really little we had this one dog that attacked people and and we had to actually get rid of him 

160.84 167.68 B: um but then when i was a teenager we had this other dog and he would only attack men 

167.97 168.93 A: (( [laughter] )) 

168.27 171.55 B: and [laughter] he would and and o- only certain men 

171.68 185.68 B: um and he i i re- and it was weird because he he was like very cute like he didn't look like a dog that would ever do anything any harm to anyone like he he kind of looked like an oversized benji 

185.43 186.51 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

185.91 196.17 B: you know but he would he would attack and he'd go right for the neck i i think 'ca- 'cause he was abused like we got him when he was ten months old and apparently like the people before that 

190.24 192.41 A: oh yeah 

195.95 201.74 B: had abused him and i assume it was probably a man that abused him 'cause he never attacked women ever 

200.93 208.30 A: yeah i don't know see for me it's every time i get near a dog they tend to bark [laughter] they're like vici- 

207.81 209.84 B: what about little dogs 

209.36 224.26 A: uh even little dogs they start barking at me i don't know what the deal is and [laughter] i'm a very nice guy believe me i'm like very very nice guy i don't look evil i don't think i'm very approachable but 

213.09 216.17 B: are you evil [laughter] 

216.75 218.37 B: [laughter] 

220.60 221.75 B: [laughter] 

224.33 225.11 A: um 

225.07 227.54 A: it just seems like they always bark at me for some reason 

227.53 242.52 A: and i mean don't get me wrong i lived with a guy for a semester that had a dog initially i wouldn't come to the house [laughter] unless that dog was locked up somewhere and you know i'd go upstairs and the dog was not allowed upstairs and i lived upstairs most of the time anyways 

242.56 243.91 A: (( but um )) 

244.00 248.28 A: after a while i got comfortable with it with the dog and the dog got comfortable with me and stuff 

247.34 248.97 B: what kind of dog was it 

248.70 257.48 A: i th- it was a lab i think yeah yeah but but [laughter] not with me [laughter] 

250.06 253.19 B: uh-huh they're nice they're calm 

254.14 255.08 B: [laughter] 

255.16 257.92 B: (( [laughter] but )) 

257.31 269.53 A: [laughter] well yeah he kept chasing me for a long time and i the problem was he liked my room and every time i would i would close the door i don't know how he would manage to get in 

269.37 273.82 A: i'd get in and i find his spit and slobber on my bed and i like man 

273.92 278.29 B: he didn't like it just wants you to play he wasn't trying to to bite you or anything right 

274.51 275.48 A: (( i )) 

275.71 281.13 A: just yeah well like for me for me seeing a dog running at me and barking it was like 

280.34 281.67 B: [laughter] 

280.94 295.48 A: [laughter] it was like sheesh [laughter] run away [laughter] and so e- now ever since that happened even cats like if i see a cat or anything moving i think it just i quiver 

295.45 296.76 A: like if i feel 

295.65 297.80 B: oh so you're scared of cats too 

297.64 310.20 A: n- well i'm not scared of them but if i a- the thing is i once i you know if i'm sitting there and i'm not expecting it and i feel its you know fur touching me and i'm like freaking out you know 

299.11 300.62 B: [laughter] 

309.07 311.34 B: [noise] are you grossed out by it 

310.78 321.93 A: it's not that i mean a- after that i'm all right you know after i get comfortable and i know it's a cat and then i'm okay but initially like i'm not a i'm not a i never had a pet 

321.96 336.31 A: you know that would walk around [laughter] i had fish and stuff like that but nothing like moving around and so like i would never expect to feel something rubbing against my leg or anything like that and it would freak me out for a second after a while 

336.36 340.96 A: the cats tend to come and sit in my lap and let me pet it and i'm okay with that 

340.31 344.19 B: cats always go to people that don't like cats they're known for that 

343.57 344.88 A: really 

344.29 354.41 B: yeah they always do they one my one of my grandma my grandmother hated cats and when i was a kid whenever my grandmother came over the cat would go right to her and jump right on her lap 

344.98 346.44 A: (( yeah maybe they do )) 

346.47 347.32 A: (( uh )) 

354.22 355.94 A: (( [noise] yeah well like ))
