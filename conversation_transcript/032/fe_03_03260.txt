150.74 152.31 A: (( so yeah i ah )) 

152.43 154.25 A: that's an interesting topic um 

154.64 157.54 A: [noise] i think for everybody it's very different there's ah if 

157.72 164.76 A: you have a long term plan or long term goals in in mind what you know you have to sort of [noise] keep that in mind all the time make sure that 

165.04 174.81 A: um you know the little the small stuff the d- daily stuff doesn't doesn't bug you if if you still have your long term plan ah in the sights i guess 

172.95 174.07 B: yeah 

174.53 175.70 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

175.10 177.05 A: (( um but ah [noise] )) 

177.65 179.67 A: um i think that's hard to do 

180.34 182.40 B: very hard to do and um 

183.60 187.87 B: what i've found in comm- er what i've found is sometimes people are 

188.09 190.35 B: attracted to the opposites 

190.45 194.52 B: and then later on you find that the opposites can drive you nuts 

194.26 196.27 A: (( yeah i like it )) 

194.70 196.91 B: [laughter] it's kind of ah 

197.11 205.97 B: it's like sometimes you have to stop and say wait a minute the things i liked about this person when i first met 'em is that we were different and now these little differences drive me nuts 

205.68 206.74 A: yeah 

206.11 208.54 B: so it's it's it is hard 

208.20 209.39 A: yeah i agree with you 

209.42 210.29 A: um 

209.73 210.31 B: (( [mn] )) 

211.28 216.32 A: yeah my ah my my wife and i are [noise] you know very compatible in many ways 

216.41 221.47 A: um but there's you know it's hard to have everything so you kinda you think about 

219.16 226.83 B: [noise] right right well if you if you were completely in in sync it would probably be dull so 

226.62 227.91 A: it would probably be dull 

227.63 229.02 B: probably yeah 

228.18 229.60 A: yeah maybe yeah 

229.67 232.36 A: i guess like yeah that could be annoying as well [laughter] 

232.63 234.41 A: (( so ah it would )) 

233.61 235.24 B: (( yeah yeah [noise] )) 

234.54 239.40 A: be hard hard to find the ideal situation the ideal situation might not be the ideal situation [noise] 

238.73 242.92 B: [noise] well i think you know we're all everybody's always looking for 

242.99 248.35 B: perfection and it and i think it's very hard to find [noise] but um 

244.41 245.32 A: yeah 

246.69 247.53 A: (( mm )) 

248.70 251.63 B: ah there's nothing like having somebody that you know

292.19 305.11 A: was worried about it before um but you kinda just have to get on with your life and take precautions when necessary but ah um i mean luckily i haven't had to go to the hospital too much but um 

298.24 301.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

301.84 302.87 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

305.06 310.40 A: i think it's it was all blown out of proportion and things and people were very cautious here about 

310.35 321.51 A: everything [noise] at first so when you do when you did go to a clinic or a hospital um or go by you can see everyone's wearing a mask and you had to you know you kind of wonder when everyone's wearing a mask h- how safe are we 

311.44 312.93 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

321.37 322.50 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

321.84 322.68 A: um 

322.74 325.51 B: oh it's just the panic yeah 

322.76 324.10 A: [noise] and i 

324.62 335.08 A: i like to be in public i like to you know walk on the streets and and to take the public transit the bus and everything and um you know that was a bit ah scary at first but when now ah 

330.62 331.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

334.56 341.32 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] yeah well that's good )) 

335.66 339.02 A: everything seems to be okay ah back to normal 

339.39 340.44 A: um 

340.99 342.60 A: yeah it seems everything's fine 

343.24 346.43 A: hard to tell really don't really know about this kind of stuff 

345.17 346.55 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

347.39 352.01 A: but ah i think it c- it would be pretty impossible to contain something like that 

351.51 355.62 B: yeah well what how many ah in the area are they saying are infected [noise] 

355.09 360.53 A: [lipsmack] well th- a few hundred were affected um um something like fifteen people died 

360.49 365.43 B: yeah but i i'm hearing it's mostly older people that are subject to 

361.20 362.33 A: which is a b- 

366.29 370.43 A: yeah who are already ill in some way and then it's sort of like a 

370.55 376.45 A: i i'm not comparing it to a- i'm not saying it's like aids but i'm comparing it in the way that it takes advantage of your 

376.16 377.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

377.09 381.76 A: of of you if you're already sick or already your immune system's down i think 

379.08 379.83 B: yeah 

381.29 382.64 B: yeah 

381.94 383.04 A: but um 

384.26 385.83 A: anyway i guess ah 

386.38 388.41 A: got off the topic there a little bit 

387.81 389.59 B: (( yeah [laughter] well )) 

389.71 392.87 B: um yeah i don't know how much more we can 

390.51 391.59 A: (( so how are )) 

392.72 394.12 A: talk about there yeah 

393.37 398.75 B: yeah yeah it's a tough one i mean it's not hard to talk about but it's just hard to 

395.20 396.39 A: what um 

398.20 405.60 A: so have you have you have you b- been with people that you think there ah there might be a potential life partner or has that ever happened for you 

405.80 407.90 B: oh yeah yeah um 

408.49 411.45 B: i've had ah you know so 

411.49 418.91 B: pretty recently um somebody i was with for about four years but ah s- sometimes you um 

416.14 417.33 A: yeah 

419.26 422.01 B: in the beginning you're heading the same way and all of a sudden 

422.47 424.20 B: people start to 

425.16 427.50 B: (( ah you know change and um )) 

426.22 427.50 A: yeah 

427.66 430.09 B: so [mn] you know it's it's ah 

430.19 432.15 B: it's frustrating but ah 

431.28 432.07 A: yeah 

432.15 433.39 A: (( definitely )) 

433.53 437.92 B: [cough] the way i look at th- [mn] the way i look at it is you just gotta learn and 

438.67 439.72 B: move on yeah yeah as 

439.65 444.21 A: yeah yeah definitely it's ah it's a tough one there's ah 

444.24 446.53 A: lots of things to think about these days ah 

447.05 453.96 A: you know think about your own career and your own life and your own needs and sometimes it can be hard to fit in other people 

454.06 457.69 A: um hm that's the way i'm kind of thinking about myself lately because 

457.88 464.80 A: you know i'm having a hard time meeting my needs being a f- you know being a a dad and a 

464.90 468.32 A: and a partner i'm having a hard time meeting my own needs sometimes so 

468.49 470.80 A: that's definitely something that's on my mind 

469.39 473.93 B: far as i'm o- once you got a child you have to s- put yourself second you know 

473.79 479.06 A: yeah definitely definitely yeah so um 

479.78 481.51 A: we'll see how that goes 

481.64 482.61 A: and 

481.70 483.73 B: h- how many years you been married

494.10 494.72 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

499.67 501.93 A: this is another interesting 

502.20 511.97 A: and something related to the topic is my parents and my partner and my wife's parents were both ah divorced and so we were very 

511.49 512.78 B: hesitant huh 

512.27 519.23 A: eluded by the whole concept of marriage and we were hesitant to do that and we thought you know we could [cough] 

516.93 517.80 B: yeah 

519.39 521.03 A: just show our love by 

521.28 525.62 A: continuing our relationship instead of focussing on something like m- marriage 

525.54 526.55 B: yeah 

525.92 528.95 A: but then after our daughter was born ah in ninety nine ah 

529.40 535.01 A: we decided in january two thousand to get married just for the hell of it we also weren't really into the ah 

532.64 533.56 B: yeah 

535.14 541.21 A: you know save up or spend thirty thousand dollars and have a huge party and then spend the next ten years paying it off or whatever 

535.68 537.48 B: the ceremony yeah 

541.54 547.77 A: you know there's i mean i've been to a few of those weddings and three hundred people show up or whatever it's crazy um 

543.43 544.05 B: (( [cough] )) 

545.53 546.42 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

548.01 558.79 A: so we just had one where we it was new year's eve and we were at um my in laws and they we you know there was only ten of us there having a party and we just sort of surprised everyone and said 

558.83 562.92 A: by the way we're getting married tomorrow and you're welcome to join us if you want to 

562.76 565.06 B: so what you do like a quick elope or

572.79 575.67 A: then we took off to the carribean for a couple of weeks with our daughter 

575.39 578.66 B: yeah yeah well that's a good way to do it this way ah you know 

576.12 577.36 A: which was a lot of fun 

580.54 583.65 B: not a lot of money is ah put out and 

582.36 585.03 A: yeah exactly yeah yeah we don't
