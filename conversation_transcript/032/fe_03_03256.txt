4.39 7.40 A: hi hetty this is jim from new york new york 

6.95 9.51 B: oh wow [laughter] 

9.26 10.97 A: long distance this one 

10.68 14.52 B: mhm this one too do you know where manitoba is 

14.24 17.88 A: um is that western canada 

17.21 19.48 B: no it's above north dakota 

19.38 26.45 A: above n- oh okay i g- so i guess from here that's that's sort of western to me i suppose above north dakota okay okay sort of like so i guess central then pretty much 

22.14 23.39 B: right right 

24.21 25.14 B: (( mhm )) 

25.81 31.18 B: right right anyways i guess the topic is what you find in a life partner 

26.63 27.54 A: okay 

29.33 29.94 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

30.83 36.03 A: what yeah what d- what do we find is most important in a life partner i think i think 

32.73 33.58 B: (( [mn] ok- [mn] )) 

34.55 35.56 B: mhm 

35.76 37.75 B: oh okay and yourself 

37.11 39.68 A: um well i think um [lipsmack] 

40.02 50.68 A: a lot of things i guess ah most important i think is someone that you're able to talk to and to be able to be ah sort of 

41.18 41.75 B: (( [mn] )) 

50.87 61.64 A: r- r- r- reveal your most honest thoughts with them um i and to to be yourself and to to feel to feel good about yourself when you're with them 

54.12 54.79 B: (( mm )) 

60.40 67.45 B: right right i guess for me it's communication skills but maybe for a man it's different than women 

63.84 65.63 A: mhm 

67.18 68.98 A: mhm 

67.85 72.85 B: because usually i guess for women they show their emotions more than men 

72.52 73.43 A: uh-huh 

73.37 75.07 B: or you don't find that 

74.72 81.83 A: yeah i think so because i think um actually ah when when i think about it um [mn] i i probably 

81.81 92.78 A: feel like i i can't um show my emotions as much with my men friends as i can with my girlfriend so i suppose that's ah yeah i guess th- th- th- that's true um 

86.62 87.21 B: (( mm )) 

88.13 89.15 B: (( oh [noise] hm )) 

92.92 101.34 A: we generally don't express ourselves as much or as as as freely um when a bunch of guys are together so ah 

101.51 107.74 A: so i guess in a way it is it is ah communication in in the same way i suppose um 

105.64 106.40 B: mhm 

107.72 110.29 B: well how long have you been going out with your girlfriend 

109.76 112.32 A: um about a year and a half 

111.71 114.78 B: oh okay so do you think you know her well 

114.58 116.15 A: [lipsmack] i think so 

115.74 121.13 B: you think so well i've been married for twenty nine years just had an anniversary 

118.36 119.42 A: (( bless you )) 

121.17 123.19 B: [lipsmack] and you know you think you know your 

122.57 125.51 A: [laughter] 

123.29 128.97 B: partner really well and i think as time goes on you take it almost for granted 

128.60 135.66 A: oh well i guess that's true th- th- that can happen too w- w- d- does your husband still surprise you from time to time 

132.03 132.59 B: (( [noise] )) 

134.70 148.15 B: um just no not really not really he kind of does his thing and i do mine you know kind of my own and um sometimes like you know i guess maybe when you're first dating you want to know everything about a person 

140.10 141.44 A: mhm 

147.72 149.57 A: mhm 

148.42 153.74 B: and i can now after twenty nine years say well what's my favorite ice cream and he still doesn't know 

153.12 154.61 A: oh really [laughter] 

153.99 157.28 B: really really but i think you know at the beginning 

154.97 155.96 A: (( [sigh] )) 

157.43 162.23 B: you do want to know more about a person and you kind of put your best foot forward 

161.63 163.16 A: mhm 

162.94 174.84 B: and you know you're really polite and everything because i know my son's twenty three still lives at home and is dating and you know how he behaves on a date as how he behaves at home are two different 

174.25 175.86 A: [laughter] 

175.40 177.76 B: believe me two different ways 

177.15 178.12 A: (( uh-huh )) 

178.09 184.43 B: so you know it's h- he just started dating like two months ago with this one specific girl 

184.60 190.06 B: so ah it's like what we see at home and how he is with her is totally different 

189.44 193.49 A: very different [laughter] and and how how how old is he 

190.70 191.94 B: very different 

193.12 194.28 B: twenty three 

193.70 194.85 A: oh twenty three 

194.34 195.71 B: mhm mhm 

195.09 201.81 A: uh-huh well i suppose that's especially that's especially true when you're when you're younger and when your dating um 

199.05 199.75 B: (( mm )) 

202.10 206.81 A: um i mean i know there's like i'm i'm thirty nine and um 

205.25 206.00 B: okay 

207.17 221.02 A: i think that myself and my girlfriend we've sort of gone through that phase of where we only allow each other to see our our best side where i i think that know we've each of us have seen the other um 

215.98 216.74 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

221.29 229.40 A: at the worst in some ways i mean i- i- and it its i guess that's ah sort of an important thing that that your life partner um 

229.81 238.46 A: will sort of be willing to see you when you're down or when you're angry or upset or whatever and they can still sort of 

238.48 245.99 A: they can still say yes that th- th- th- that's who ah part of who you are and that's fine that's okay and i i accept that too um 

245.48 256.40 B: but i guess you know i wonder nowadays like [mn] when you're really young eighteen twen- early twenties it's like you're really out there looking and it's to impress 

251.08 252.91 A: mhm 

256.10 257.32 A: mhm 

256.54 266.90 B: because i have an eighteen year old daughter as well and that's the big thing and i keep saying well as [cough] life goes down the road all those things aren't that important anymore 

266.37 268.17 A: right right 

267.53 275.15 B: because as you know yourself if you're thirty nine years old it becomes a matter of working support right 

274.54 276.31 A: mhm 

275.40 282.79 B: support from both parties but when you're really young they only think of love and fantasy you know 

282.48 284.37 A: mhm 

283.13 288.16 B: but as you get older reality hits in what life means right 

287.90 294.30 A: right a- and i guess y- y- you don't gain wisdom until you have to live [laughter] on a da- you know 

293.21 299.92 B: right that's you know way down the road way down the road mhm oh yeah 

299.84 300.77 A: (( wow )) 

300.27 307.92 B: so do you do a lot of things or like do you go out a lot or is it more that you just kind of do things at home 

307.20 315.19 A: um we most we don't we i mean you know we're living in new york so we we do try to ah take advantage of of the things that are here 

314.78 315.70 B: mhm 

315.06 325.20 A: um but we probably go out um to hear some music or something or go to dinner maybe mm a couple of times a week may- you know if on a good week a couple of times 

319.88 320.64 B: (( oh [mn] )) 

324.68 326.05 B: right right okay 

325.26 330.61 A: um but you know we enjoy just spending time at home together um 

330.56 340.89 B: 'cause i find with the young people it's they want to always want to go out to nightclubs out eating as where i think older people once you establish a certain relationship 

335.14 336.21 A: right 

341.07 348.03 B: you kind of just you know whether you just stay home or just take a walk in the park just simple things 

346.26 353.92 A: yeah yeah simple things and you know y- y- you can find more enjoyment from the the sort of more lasting to um 

349.51 350.28 B: [noise] 

352.31 353.61 B: right right mm 

354.15 355.69 A: you know and again it's ah 

355.76 360.16 A: i mean i i ah i've never been married and and it's i- i'm sort of um 

361.19 374.52 A: ah even though m- my brother my brothers and sisters had all married when they were younger and in their twenties i'm sort of glad that [noise] well i mean the th- thing is i sort of never really found the the right person i don't think um i had 

372.60 379.06 B: right but do you think as you get older one gets more um established in their own routine 

379.11 383.64 B: their own ways and it a person becomes more choosier 

383.68 387.16 A: yes yes yes i think so i think so 

386.23 400.67 B: [noise] you get married when you're in your early twenties it's wow it's exciting we're going to do this and this and this but i think as you get older you start seeing qualities or whether you know whatever the other person does in their work re- you know 

400.48 402.39 A: mhm 

400.96 405.89 B: relationship or whatever and then you start becoming more choosier because you know 

406.37 409.07 B: if you end up marrying this person 

409.26 416.41 B: they have to be the right one because like they say for better or for worse and nowadays it's like two or three years and people are getting divorced 

412.50 413.43 A: uh-huh 

415.78 420.87 A: yeah yeah [lipsmack] well and i think that very often people get married 

420.47 421.39 B: mhm 

420.75 430.96 A: um before they've really become who they are or or who they're going to become um i mean [mn] i think i think it it doesn't it's not necessary a specifically a 

431.12 445.76 A: a certain age all of a sudden you know who you are i think it's different for for you know every person but i think very often like i i know friends that um that were together in high school that if they got married right out of high school um 

432.73 433.46 B: (( [mn] mm mhm )) 

442.30 443.40 B: mhm 

445.74 456.35 A: very often they became different people when they actually became adults in their mid twenties or something and then realised oh this isn't what i wanted to do this isn't who i wanted to be with 

456.36 468.40 A: um and again you know it's for some people some people get married when they're seventeen and they're happy as can be all their lives but but i think ah i think too often people get married before they have a sense of who they are 

462.42 463.37 B: right 

468.03 482.71 B: exactly that's what i'm trying to say and like with me and my husband it's it's almost like you take each other for granted he likes things that i totally don't like whatsoever he's into sports i don't like sports i've never liked sports 

475.06 475.80 A: (( mm )) 

482.05 483.83 A: mhm 

482.70 486.31 B: but i kind of go because he plays on two different um 

486.35 496.97 B: [lipsmack] you know softball leagues so i kind of go watch when the kids were young but now he does his own thing i like music and the theatre and different things he doesn't like any of that 

487.75 489.52 A: mhm 

496.43 498.24 A: mhm 

496.98 498.65 B: and i think though 

499.10 502.61 B: sometimes opposites do attract it does work though 

503.20 509.35 B: not always it and i think people older people i'm not saying that old i'm fifty 

507.05 510.05 A: mhm 

509.38 510.37 B: but 

510.68 513.15 B: you want to make it work 

512.66 513.68 A: sure 

513.20 521.52 B: as where sometimes younger kids or like you say eighteen twenty to get married it's so exciting and then like five years later 

521.68 526.51 B: this is not what they thought it would be or too many responsibilities [noise] mhm mm 

523.88 525.73 A: right 

525.97 538.33 A: right well you know another thing i've i've sort of learned in in sort of [mn] having [mn] you know sort of um somewhat long term relationships three or four years [mn] a series of them 

538.23 543.05 A: over the years um [mn] when i was younger i sort of assumed that 

543.07 554.73 A: um if it was right it would work and there would [mn] and we wouldn't have to work at it or do anything about you know th- that things would just fall into place and everything would be wonderful and if th- things weren't wonderful 

554.54 559.99 A: then that i would take that as a as a excuse to be like well i i guess this wasn't meant to be 

559.85 571.92 A: whereas now i realise that every relationship you need to you need to put work into it and that's something i never i never sort of realized um for many many years i guess 

566.22 567.36 B: (( oh definitely [cough] )) 

571.20 572.16 B: mhm 

572.38 576.63 A: um you know but again it's something that you you can only learn with age sometimes 

576.58 587.37 B: oh and with a lot of age believe me that's what i'm trying to get across to my son like it's he's everything's very short term with him it's exciting and then once he's in a relationship 

579.00 580.02 A: [laughter] 

584.09 585.96 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

587.42 598.61 B: [cough] for a couple of months well it's same old boring and he said to me two weeks ago before our anniversary how can you wake up to the same face for twenty nine years
