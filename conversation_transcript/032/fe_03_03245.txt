19.20 21.22 A: yes i am 

20.60 21.80 B: you are 

21.61 22.58 A: yes 

22.55 27.16 B: well we have two daughters living in the denver area one in denver and one in aurora 

25.29 26.16 A: oh [mn] 

27.12 29.16 A: uh-huh oh great 

29.50 33.29 A: so what do you think about um this topic and ah 

34.11 36.15 A: the corporate scandals and 

36.66 41.91 B: yeah i can't say you know i'm not entirely up to it other than you know it was 

42.10 53.99 B: big business or something going wildly out of control or they control it in their favor that brought the stock market downfall i would i would think was the main cause behind it 

52.24 53.27 A: yeah 

54.18 65.47 A: right right well i i know one thing i have a hard time with is is ah how much the executives pay themselves 

66.40 77.37 A: i think it's outrag- you know in most countries it's okay maybe ten times what everybody else is getting paid but here in this country it's a hundred times or even more 

66.69 67.61 B: (( [noise] right )) 

78.34 79.84 B: you're right and uh 

78.69 79.41 A: it's 

80.15 84.96 B: it seems like nobody has a control on it how much they're getting paid either just 

85.01 86.48 A: right 

85.66 92.44 B: you know like they can set whatever salary they [noise] salary they want on themselves and there's no stopping it 

90.50 91.31 A: right 

92.26 100.05 A: right well i guess ah i was i was glad to see in the paper i think it was today that ah 

100.11 103.89 A: the c._e._o. of american airlines quit 

103.97 115.07 A: ah you know how they were a the ah i guess the flight attendants were voting on taking pay cuts to save that airline and they had agreed to pay cuts 

115.24 123.96 A: and then they found out that the executives were giving themselves all sorts of bonuses and pension plans and things and 

124.14 127.12 A: which was outrageous and they were outraged 

127.41 135.08 A: and so i guess they've decided to not take those ah bonuses and the c._e._o. quit 

135.86 137.91 A: did you read about that 

137.42 142.11 B: mm i haven't read anything on normally we are always getting we 

142.88 147.28 B: just recently haven't but i guess i see some of 

145.49 146.40 A: uh-huh 

147.30 151.06 B: on t._v. that i'm a little familiar with it [noise] 

151.08 152.04 A: right 

152.03 159.25 A: right well now it seems to me that it's those sorts of checks and balances that we need in 

159.23 169.89 A: in business that ah i think it's good that that labor has a stronger voice ah and i think it needs a stronger voice in this country 

170.60 174.94 A: um and i think that's been lacking in this country 

176.89 190.18 A: and we see that reflected that in the power that ah the executives have had in these corporations and the and the the power that the corporations have the laws that favor corporations and 

177.32 178.50 B: yeah 

190.61 192.69 B: (( yeah it's it's ah there )) 

193.01 202.30 B: is no no balance between the average person and the person making the major decisions with the average person's money i mean we've had situations where 

203.12 204.34 B: they had a 

204.35 207.31 B: a million dollar retire- fund of some 

207.70 215.76 B: invested through the stock market they wound up losing all of it and all of a sudden they're retirement age and there's no work for 'em so 

213.61 214.85 A: right 

216.09 217.32 A: (( right )) 

216.72 223.34 B: you know something that a lot of them had saved for their whole lifetime and come down to the end they didn't have 

220.75 221.59 A: yeah 

223.59 225.43 B: anything coming whatsoever 

225.43 234.44 A: yeah i i know a number of people uh that that has been the case and ah i think it's a tragedy 

234.74 237.25 A: i think it's a a huge betrayal 

238.29 239.69 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] yeah it's just )) 

240.63 243.26 B: no justice involved that's for sure 

243.76 250.13 A: no no there isn't and ah and i think that there should be accountability 

253.63 263.54 B: [noise] ah i guess that if their if their conscience doesn't bother them bother them doing what their doing their the accountability -bility doesn't come into them 

263.04 263.73 A: (( heh )) 

263.81 268.80 A: right right but at least at least i mean if if ah 

264.27 265.62 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

269.04 277.44 A: that this has come to light and and people are finding out what is actually going on ah there can be 

277.55 281.92 A: a a perhaps some sort of accountability 

283.64 292.22 B: [noise] right we'd hope uh we'd hope in the in the future that something so severely bad doesn't happen again that affects 

292.36 297.64 B: so many americans like this past downfall that the market had caused 

296.34 297.43 A: right 

299.29 300.41 A: (( right )) 

299.88 302.49 B: but i suppose only time will tell though 

303.02 307.95 A: right that's true are you are you at retirement age now or 

307.65 310.21 B: i'm not quite there yet no 

310.35 311.40 A: uh-huh 

311.91 315.32 A: are you concerned about being able to retire now 

315.29 318.98 B: [noise] well i guess it it is a concern of a lot of people that 

319.34 323.09 B: [noise] i guess i'm probably a little older than the baby boomer 

323.26 329.58 B: type ah generation but yet aways away from ah full retirement that [noise] 

329.77 330.85 A: right 

334.23 340.74 A: yeah i'd well that's something that concerns all of us i i i ah i'll be fifty five next month 

340.68 341.86 B: okay 

341.02 341.89 A: (( ah )) 

342.21 349.61 A: so i've still got aways to go and certainly ah you know the the stability of ah 

349.79 358.43 A: social security program and so on medicare is it's up for grabs you know it's there's no guarantees 

356.24 357.08 B: (( right )) 

359.93 364.39 B: right and then ah president bush would like to have ah 

364.61 376.01 B: social security probably eliminated in the long run and just you'd start your own type of savings but then if it happens that could happen with the past stock market investments 

376.16 380.08 B: it's not much of uh security for the average person at all then 

380.03 388.99 A: right right and [mn] you know it's [mn] and when we look at what other industrialized countries do 

389.73 398.33 A: my goodness i mean we're really way behind in in any sort of a ah ah safety net for 

398.44 400.16 A: for our our 

400.23 405.42 A: people for for the you know our country and the citizens of our country 

405.37 406.96 B: (( [noise] right )) 

408.28 409.96 B: (( [noise] yeah it's just )) 

411.65 417.12 B: it's just ah day by day fear that you hope that the right thing happens that'll 

417.19 420.85 B: lead to the best benefit of yours [noise] [noise] 

420.26 421.52 A: right 

421.74 429.22 A: right of course of course well i think that that that you know talking about it ah 

429.80 432.52 A: can really help i mean as far as 

433.45 438.05 A: discussing what what can we do and what is right and 

437.20 437.81 B: (( [noise] )) 

438.43 445.10 A: um and expressing our concerns to our our congressmen and our senators and 

444.79 446.22 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

445.72 449.98 A: letting them know it's like hey we're out here we're we're listening 

450.65 452.14 A: and we're concerned 

452.00 455.55 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

454.38 455.52 A: do you agree 

456.34 458.43 B: uh-huh right yeah i agree wholeheartedly

464.73 465.35 A: (( [sigh] )) 

466.96 469.67 A: yeah 

469.81 477.66 B: yeah i guess i i do feel sorry for people that did keep getting most of their so called money and then all their spare money and 

477.99 490.98 B: they invested it to where they thought the biggest return was going to be and they wound up losing most all of it and all they can hope there's a return ah regain some of the finance that they lost [noise] [noise] 

484.93 486.07 A: yeah 

490.36 501.17 A: yeah yeah i i have a few friends who've worked for u._s. west the you know the telephone company here it's called quest now 

498.52 499.92 B: uh-huh yeah 

501.19 511.02 A: and ah they were close to retirement they'd worked for 'em twenty years and ah a lot of their money had been invested in their stocks and ah 

501.20 501.99 B: (( right ))

511.05 513.25 A: they they can't retire now 

514.33 517.61 B: so what do you do in a situation like that 

517.03 518.86 A: they have to keep working 

519.45 528.21 B: and hopefully there's something out there if you can't remain with the same company hopefully there's something out there somewhere else in your field that you can continue working 

528.40 531.36 B: until you do reach the age that 

528.40 529.30 A: right 

531.09 532.83 A: right right

545.94 547.00 A: yeah 

546.41 556.59 B: it it's [noise] it's getting tough to find a job that was anywhere near to the pay you were [noise] probably making throughout a good portion of your working life 

556.57 562.90 A: that's right yeah oh i i i certainly i make less and less every year
