150.47 153.62 B: they're very easy to keep because you can keep them in a cage 

153.70 160.42 B: uh they're very they communicate a lot in the sense that you know uh now this uh parrot

188.77 201.30 B: uh untidy eaters so when he eats you know like when he eats in the forest i mean you know i had uh uh two farms and these parrots would just come and they eat a small portion of the fruit and it they'd destroy the fruit 

191.15 192.03 A: mhm 

200.90 202.04 A: mhm 

201.42 210.94 B: you know they just leave it for other animals to eat and they just you know eat maybe like four percent of the food and then move on to a new fresh fruit but other than that they're nice pets 

211.03 220.17 A: [noise] well that's that's very interesting so so do y- do you do you keep them in a does he does he have a a cage or does he roam around the house [noise] 

213.24 214.47 B: yeah 

219.53 225.25 B: well he has a cage now he's supposed to stay in the cage when my wife and i are out 

225.01 230.28 B: but when we're in he's outside he's out out of the cage he can't fly because his wings are clipped 

230.19 243.42 B: but he walks around he you know he goes wherever he wants to go he he you know he heads into the kitchen if my if you're eating he's and we don't get him give him food he's he's going to come over he's going to take help himself on the plate 

230.38 231.27 A: okay 

242.71 243.48 A: [laughter]

266.08 273.70 A: well um i- it's it's fine i'm i'm happy to talk about this uh i- i guess i'm kind of split between either graduate school or law school 

267.97 268.76 B: (( huh )) 

273.23 276.69 B: oh oh i might go to law school myself 

273.75 274.65 A: something

283.61 284.73 A: mhm 

292.82 298.11 B: i definitely want to stay in the city so the two options fortunately there are two very good schools here there's n._y._u. 

292.87 293.75 A: i see 

298.36 302.60 B: and there's columbia so hopefully by next year i'm going to be in one of the two 

298.39 299.26 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

302.67 306.46 A: indeed um so wh- what is your family's business in india 

305.85 308.02 B: they've got a hotel uh chain 

306.64 307.58 A: they have a 

308.62 309.50 A: i see 

309.40 310.90 B: a small hotel chain 

310.42 311.81 A: mhm 

311.89 316.82 A: yeah so um let's see my parents went to columbia actually that's where they met

318.19 319.94 B: (( uh nice nice )) 

319.95 321.57 A: mhm 

321.31 325.81 B: so how come you didn't uh go to columbia as an undergraduate mhm 

325.06 327.52 A: [noise] um well 

328.22 333.84 A: [lipsmack] i guess primarily i w- i i applied to a number of schools but um 

334.28 336.77 A: i g- i guess te- we're um 

336.86 341.30 A: my family's from texas well not not actually from but 

338.31 339.71 B: oh okay 

340.07 341.66 B: okay that makes sense 

341.17 353.70 A: um they they my parents moved there after they graduated and so um it was it was close by and much much cheaper and it was a it's ju- it's got good programs i mean 

342.97 344.67 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

353.14 356.09 B: oh that's good that's good that's good 

354.16 354.87 A: i 

355.00 360.69 A: columbia might be a little better but i wouldn't say it's necessarily enough better to to change my mind 

359.97 367.11 B: oh absolutely absolutely it really doesn't eventually matter where you go to school you know as long as you're enjoying what you do 

366.80 368.65 A: mhm 

367.40 370.44 B: and you can find so many good programs in so many different colleges 

370.55 376.50 A: yeah yes i'm i'm i'm certainly happy with with uh how i've handled things so far 

375.53 380.60 B: oh that's good that's good that's good what what year are you senior sophomore 

377.90 378.73 A: yeah 

379.90 382.76 A: i'm actually a a second year so 

381.56 383.83 B: (( second year oh nice )) 

383.00 390.89 A: n- next year i suppose i'll have to start looking at applying to schools i th- i think n._y._u. is is definitely on my on my list 

390.21 396.72 B: oh so you're not going to be uh you're going to be working at all after you graduate you're just going to go directly back to school 

396.59 398.09 A: well um 

399.00 401.63 A: i guess it depending on i mean if 

402.74 406.59 A: i'm not really sure how many um jobs there are 

406.59 414.38 A: available for people who intend you know who who who come out with a liberal arts degree and don't really intend to make a career out of it [noise] i might i could go 

407.41 408.42 B: (( mhm that's )) 

413.62 416.37 B: true that's true yeah 

414.36 429.14 A: go into sales or something but it it's not r- you know it wouldn't have any connection to going to to graduate school so i'd it might be better to get that out of the way and then and get started on you know one of the career paths they offer which m- takes a lot longer 

421.82 423.46 B: (( yeah yeah that's )) 

425.72 426.71 B: yeah 

428.89 437.71 B: right right right right right well you go that's the that's the benefit of going back to school because if the economy's in such bad shape right now 

429.16 430.23 A: to go through 

437.36 442.67 A: mhm well i i certainly have a little while to decide whether or not it's in bad shape or not 

437.87 438.69 B: (( you know )) 

441.32 443.76 B: oh yeah true you got two years 

444.31 446.63 B: (( you've got two years that's good )) 

445.85 449.56 A: mhm i have to say one one thing that i might hold a little bit against n._y._u. 

449.39 450.42 B: uh-huh 

449.64 458.72 A: is i just saw a a random survey i that said that they were the um most stylish campus in the country 

452.79 453.89 B: uh-huh 

458.46 460.63 B: they do have the most stylish campus 

460.42 465.48 A: that's or oh the students there are the the the best dressed or something along the 

464.52 465.91 B: oh that's nice 

465.56 472.62 A: well i- it's very nice if you go go there i'm sure but i don't know that i necessarily want that kind of pressure on me you know 

466.04 467.14 B: that's nice 

471.14 474.37 B: oh okay okay 

472.58 480.95 A: to be uh not not that i'm you know in great favor of of being a slob or anything but it it seems like they're [laughter] 

475.73 477.21 B: [laughter] 

478.23 480.03 B: right right right 

481.18 482.10 A: you know it 

481.36 485.09 B: well it seems like they're putting the emphasis on the wrong syllable 

484.78 492.59 A: yeah ce- certainly they um the the same survey was ju- i me- the the news article was quoting the survey and they were 

485.20 486.06 B: right 

486.26 487.49 B: right 

492.01 493.01 B: (( uh-huh )) 

492.36 506.73 A: talking about um i think it was southern methodist up in dallas and they were and they were saying how how the the school's you know excellently has an excellent location near to many um boutiques and it was [laughter] this has nothing to do with what i want to do at school 

495.23 496.88 B: (( oh okay )) 

502.27 504.39 B: [laughter] 

505.85 512.31 B: exactly exactly that is so superficial i mean what does that have to do with law school 

510.40 511.62 A: mhm 

512.12 514.80 A: [laughter] yeah absolutely 

514.17 516.99 B: but it's a good have you spent time in new york at all 

517.03 518.18 A: um 

518.32 520.41 A: not really i've i've 

521.01 530.00 A: i've i've i've flown through it a through it a few times um and i visited once when i was very little i remember visiting the statue of liberty that's about it 

523.48 524.41 B: uh-huh 

526.84 528.56 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

529.40 535.08 B: well it's a great city mhm it's a great city i tell my wife it's one of the greatest cities in the world 

535.10 536.82 B: (( and i've been to europe )) 

535.25 544.76 A: well depending on how you define great i think it could really claim to be the greatest it's it's it's probably the um the epitome of what a city really is 

539.00 540.25 B: oh sure 

541.17 542.04 B: (( sure )) 

543.81 551.13 B: yeah yeah absolutely and it the the problem though the flipside is it's in uh it's not in good shape at all 

550.61 551.69 A: mhm 

551.06 563.48 B: uh from a fiscal perspective you know because the city's broke and they have no money for anything and they're trying to raise taxes and the people the economy's in really really bad shape and the competition is intense 

554.70 555.62 A: mhm 

557.16 558.08 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

563.93 571.76 B: so you know you're it's it's it's uh a lot of people are worried that it's going to go back to the bad old days of the seventies and the early eighties 

571.48 574.85 A: mhm [noise] 

572.32 577.71 B: because you know the the the economy is the the the state just doesn't have any money at all 

577.85 584.14 A: yeah and and then there's things like schools and also other things that i'm sure are problems 

583.59 585.08 B: yeah yeah that's 

585.27 596.24 A: um and and i guess ju- as a as a person from texas it's it's the idea of not owning your own house or necessarily having a car it just seems very hard to get used to 

585.96 586.60 B: (( true )) 

595.96 599.95 B: oh you know that is so true because i was that's one of the things i
