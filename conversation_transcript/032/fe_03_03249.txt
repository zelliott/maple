0.07 2.17 A: hello 

1.47 3.22 B: (( hello ah )) 

2.47 4.26 A: hi this is earl 

4.53 6.22 B: hi this is amy 

6.08 7.28 A: hi amy 

6.96 8.23 B: how are you 

7.84 9.28 A: (( good how are you )) 

8.79 9.92 B: i'm good 

9.79 11.82 A: (( good )) 

11.47 12.85 B: (( o- okay so )) 

12.03 16.44 A: so what do you think is the most important thing to look for in a life's partner 

16.51 20.11 B: um let's see probably 

20.31 21.62 B: honesty 

21.63 23.89 A: [noise] you must have read my mind 

23.36 25.26 B: (( really that what you were going to say )) 

24.63 28.12 A: [mn] yeah why 

29.12 30.55 B: are you married 

30.57 32.02 A: no i'm not 

31.47 32.35 B: (( uh-huh but )) 

32.57 34.71 B: that's what you're looking for [laughter] 

34.21 36.66 A: right [laughter] 

37.05 41.17 B: why so why do you think why why do think honesty's the most important thing 

41.35 50.15 A: well because [cough] i feel like if if someone is honest [cough] you know it's it's always good to get someone 

50.97 60.32 A: (( who's intelligent [cough] excuse me and a- attractive and and who is faithful and all of that )) 

60.41 70.68 A: [cough] excuse me but if the person is dishonest i just don't see how i can have a relationship with them period i mean i i can't 

71.33 75.75 A: that's one of my one of the requirements that i have for friendship as well 

75.16 81.36 B: right i was going to say that it's not even just like a partner thing but it's just being with people in general not right 

79.93 85.05 A: right see [mn] i can't be around people who are not honest with 

84.42 85.91 B: (( right [mn] )) 

85.20 86.60 A: you know who 

86.68 93.72 A: i can't trust and i don't think you can have a relationship with anybody on any level if they're not honest 

88.05 88.82 B: right 

91.39 92.55 B: (( mhm )) 

93.06 94.01 B: right 

94.04 94.62 A: (( [cough] )) 

94.34 95.43 B: i agree 

95.03 100.89 A: i think that's like the first requirement for a relationship on any level what about you 

100.87 107.72 B: yeah i think that's the first requirement i'd i'd say it's very important also to um have similar interests 

107.30 109.60 A: (( [noise] oh yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

108.99 118.99 B: i mean because i you know i know a lot of people who get married to people that they really like but then they end up breaking up or div- divorced or something 

118.78 128.28 B: and it's not that they don't like each other they get along great but you know one of them wants to go out every night and one wants to stay home and watch t._v. and although that seems kind of like oh well you can work through that i mean 

128.24 134.26 B: you know it's very difficult if you want to live your life one way and your partner wants to live it the other i mean that's your life you know 

133.74 134.87 A: right 

134.34 145.35 B: so i mean it you know no matter how much two people like each other if they have different ways of of of approaching life and fun and stuff like that it- it's probably not going to work out for very long [laughter] 

139.84 140.62 A: (( [cough] )) 

145.17 148.12 A: oh i i agree absolutely 

147.58 150.34 B: so that's something i think is very important what about you 

150.37 151.54 A: (( yeah )) 

150.66 154.44 B: i don't know if it's like number two on my list but it's just something i thought of 

153.86 160.08 A: yeah you have to have [lipsmack] you have to be honest and you have you have to have common interests 

160.21 161.70 A: and [sigh] [lipsmack] 

161.84 164.24 A: i think you [mn] before 

164.58 166.57 A: any even a even a 

166.59 171.26 A: a those two things exist i think both people have to 

171.65 175.52 A: kind of [sigh] love you have to kind of love yourself 

175.08 176.09 B: mhm 

176.35 178.32 A: and you have to um 

178.46 183.75 A: [lipsmack] i think both people have to be willing to give a little and you know to get a little 

183.35 184.31 B: right 

184.19 187.70 A: you have to be willing to to compromise 

187.31 188.30 B: yeah 

188.13 195.98 A: and i think that's a a big problem with a lot of people too that's why a lot of relationships don't work nobody's willing to compromise everybody wants 

196.00 199.90 A: everything that goes their way one hundred percent [laughter] you know 

199.03 200.99 B: uh-huh yeah that's true 

200.86 202.65 A: and it doesn't happen 

202.24 205.03 B: yeah that's definitely true i hadn't thought about that 

204.82 214.76 A: but i think if your completely honest with the person before you commit to a a long term relationship you know getting back to the honesty issue 

215.04 220.89 A: then a lot of those thing a lot of those problems are probably headed off or prevented even 

220.64 221.93 B: mhm 

221.52 230.83 A: because if if you're honest in expressing how you feel about certain things then the other person can know that y- y- who you really are 

230.44 231.32 B: right 

231.01 236.83 A: and judge or d- determine whether they really wanna be with you on a long term basis 

236.30 237.26 B: mhm 

237.47 245.01 B: yeah that's true because you're you're telling them exactly what you're looking for and and stuff like that and you're being [mn] again back to the honesty you're being honest 

244.38 250.75 A: right and i think a lot of the problems with a lot of people you know with a lot of couples is that 

250.84 262.03 A: they pretend to be something that they're not when they [laughter] you know like for instance they may not really like to go out a lot before they get married and you know 

262.13 272.00 A: they say oh well i'll just do this because i i wanna be with this person and then once once they get married they end up changing and they don't want to do certain things 

271.73 278.04 B: right because they were pretending from the beginning that there were the way some- somebody that they weren't yeah 

275.50 276.87 A: (( right )) 

277.88 286.47 B: yeah that's true i think sometimes people also like it's not even so much that they're pretending but they think okay well i really like this person i can make myself 

286.26 296.53 B: be like this or something you know because this is what they want and i like them but you're not being true to yourself if you do that because you need to be with somebody that's right for you and you know right for them and everything [noise] so 

296.09 304.80 A: yeah so i i think we could probably i could would would also add not only do you need to be honest with the other person first of all you need to be honest with yourself 

304.27 305.31 B: mhm 

305.67 319.28 A: and do things that are true to yourself i mean not try to pretend to be somebody else and not try to do things just because but not all i mean everybody does things sometimes that somebody else wants them to do but 

305.85 306.59 B: yeah 

309.27 310.03 B: right 

318.52 320.37 B: of course [laughter] 

319.41 321.03 A: not all the time 

320.38 321.46 B: uh-huh 

321.25 322.25 A: (( you know )) 

321.80 329.48 B: yeah that would get really tiring [laughter] [mn] every day trying to do something to please somebody else and and not being yourself 

323.38 324.90 A: yeah i mean 

327.24 328.29 A: right 

329.63 330.72 B: yeah 

330.13 332.33 A: exactly that's what i say too 

331.92 333.18 B: yeah 

332.59 334.28 A: so are you married 

333.68 334.97 B: yes i am 

334.57 336.91 A: oh okay how long have you been married 

336.19 339.63 B: i've been married for a little over five years 

339.03 340.46 A: oh okay 

339.99 341.54 B: (( yeah so )) 

341.65 343.19 A: (( good [noise] )) 

342.18 349.37 B: i i did find somebody that had all those traits that i was looking for so [laughter] so it worked out well for me 

349.04 357.03 A: well that's that's good did you find that your husband was pretty much the same before you married him as he is now 

356.75 359.03 B: mhm yeah i really 

358.97 367.96 B: i mean i met my husband pretty young we were both in college and um [lipsmack] you know some people say you know i we didn't we didn't marry in college but you know people say oh when 

367.87 380.86 B: it's hard when you meet somebody young and then you get married because then you change and sometimes you change away from each other but i think we've both changed but we've changed like where we're still the same you know what i mean like we've changed but we're still 

373.96 375.03 A: mhm 

380.90 388.93 B: we haven't changed in ways that are offensive to each other or anything like that so i mean he's definitely changed and i think i have too but you know 

384.42 385.44 A: right 

388.13 390.18 A: but you're still compatible 

389.48 399.18 B: right exactly it might be in other and and it might be good changes it's not necessarily all you know when people say people change it's not necessarily all bad things that you can change into you know [laughter] 

398.36 400.03 A: well that's true too 

399.14 409.25 B: [laughter] i've never understood that people say oh you've changed so much and i think well sometimes you can change for the better you know it's not necessarily you know oh he's changed i don't like him anymore so 

409.40 411.42 B: no i i've found it to be 

411.44 414.96 B: wonderful i would highly recommend it [laughter] marriage 

414.99 416.49 B: [laughter] so 

417.30 419.35 A: so do you have kids also 

417.41 417.97 B: (( [lipsmack] ))

484.66 485.92 A: yeah
