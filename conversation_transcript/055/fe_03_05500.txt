13.62 18.82 A: (( the question was i don't really know what the question was all i know is they recording for ten minutes )) 

18.97 20.11 A: on censorship 

20.49 24.06 B: okay how do you how do you feel about censorship 

24.34 29.15 A: [noise] on books in schools depending on what kind of books they are i mean if it's like uh 

29.75 37.27 A: (( gay pornography whatever or you know [mn] someone or something like that that's probably more about )) 

38.08 39.18 B: (( okay )) 

40.25 44.32 B: yeah uh i don't think that they should have censorship because uh 

44.37 47.73 B: under the constitution it's illegal 

47.23 54.70 A: yeah but certain i agree with you on that yes but there's certain things that kept us in a moral structure that made us a stronger nation 

49.22 52.67 B: (( mhm )) 

55.08 58.97 A: and when decline of moral structure and then a nation 

60.10 63.34 A: destroys a society and it's been proven in history 

63.88 66.41 B: so you think that some censorship is 

66.47 70.76 B: (( good is )) 

67.16 69.13 A: some censorship to a degree

86.67 88.65 B: okay okay 

87.79 94.00 A: so certain i mean there are a lot of those books i agree but censorship on certain books i think they shouldn't read because

137.69 140.88 B: yeah and what it 

137.77 141.96 A: i don't have no opinion on that that's automatically set the rule 

142.00 147.01 B: mhm and internet censorship 

146.42 149.47 A: that i agree on depending on what it's for though 

147.73 152.07 B: yo- you agree on that internet censorship

239.33 248.78 B: at th- at the library she wanted to look up something about breast cancer and when they showed information about breast cancer they showed a breast 

249.35 253.87 B: they showed the the naked breast and 

252.62 255.45 A: that is understandable that's educational use 

254.80 258.71 B: yes that's educational but with censorship 

256.63 257.51 A: yes 

258.79 268.40 B: they'll they'll take some of that out of there where if if you're looking for something about breast cancer you won't be able to find certain things 

267.23 271.65 A: well that's like going on the like you know like certain laws though too i mean 

271.66 278.88 A: you have you can kill someone if they break inside your house but they the door you're charged with murder 

271.67 275.10 B: (( yeah )) 

280.08 281.10 A: (( okay it )) 

281.16 283.16 A: goes under the category of 

284.11 287.28 B: (( right )) 

284.19 289.77 A: if it has to so with you know cancer society they should show that 

290.62 295.94 A: and see what the things are amongst all these i mean that mommy and daddy or whatever they're going through 

295.94 303.33 B: yeah well they'll they'll pick a lot of that off because they won't want to show uh sexual organs 

303.34 308.90 B: you know s- say say for instance you want to look up something about testicular cancer 

303.41 305.32 A: (( well and they have i mean )) 

308.52 310.76 A: (( yes i agree with you on that )) 

308.98 321.92 B: and and they'll they'll show the penis or or o- ovarian cancer they'll show you know the ovaries you know and and the vagina and and and they'll take a lot of that off of there because it shows 

317.56 320.39 A: well that that one of the certain things that 

321.07 326.54 A: what if it's in the schools they didn't take also we had that when we were in school i don't know how old you are so 

326.22 327.07 B: (( mm ))

343.36 344.75 A: you did see that porn 

344.92 346.71 A: but that was for science use 

346.88 348.70 B: yeah 

347.71 351.69 A: and kids laughed and joked about it but that's the side type of thing you'd have to see 

350.16 352.45 B: sure they did [laughter] 

352.29 355.92 A: but that's that's a censorship they shouldn't they shouldn't cut that out 

355.87 363.09 B: yeah well that's that s where they going to have the problem because uh they don't know 

362.09 367.04 A: i think the censorship of knowledge of people information and 

367.48 374.43 A: certain things round the united states they should stop like bombs and stuff like that 

374.24 375.23 B: (( mm )) 

375.41 381.64 A: uh things like the terrorist have uh actually total access how do you think they planned everything so accurately 

375.47 376.61 B: (( [lipsmack] uh )) 

381.54 387.21 B: [lipsmack] so what about dead bodies with their heads cut of and and uh 

387.43 395.94 B: [cough] if somebody blows up a bus the people laying out there round the bus with their bodies torn apart you think 

393.90 398.44 A: european europe doesn't do this doesn't do that censorship why should we 

399.99 404.34 B: because we we're not used to seeing things like that we're we're 

400.11 401.81 A: it's a reality 

404.12 405.34 A: exactly 

404.86 408.03 B: we're a nation where we don't like seeing 

408.20 411.07 B: dead the dead and destruction 

411.56 417.83 B: you know other countries will show that other countries will show that but we won't 

411.86 413.68 A: well when you see that on nine eleven 

416.33 420.42 A: but how come other coun- we have the most violence the most crime out of every nation 

421.33 428.00 B: that's what i wonder you know that uh why are we so afraid to show what death and destruction is when we 

428.15 431.20 B: are the ones that's doing most of it 

430.44 432.18 A: (( well i agree with you percent )) 

433.51 439.83 A: are doing most of it back you know when the would if you add up all the thing like certain things i mean 

440.08 443.98 A: censorship i mean there's certain laws they got to learn how to and they 

444.01 447.05 A: like prostitution in france is legal if the girl wants to do it 

444.44 445.00 B: (( [mn] )) 

447.28 449.66 A: if they legalize prostitution i mean 

449.69 450.62 B: (( mm )) 

449.85 455.63 A: they thought i mean that those censorship but we're talking about censorship here i mean they should just legalize a lot of things 

455.81 459.52 A: and that's li- then like prostitution that's censorship technically 

460.18 469.55 B: yeah and in other countries it's it's uh accepted like in uh amsterdam amsterdam's red light district 

464.25 464.98 A: (( yeah )) 

466.78 469.10 A: amsterdam drugs are not drugs 

469.85 471.74 A: france it's are illegal 

471.68 479.79 B: yeah and and then even on t._v. they'll they'll show more on t._v. than what we we will here 

472.96 475.99 A: okay if the woman is not forced to do it 

479.09 480.08 A: yes 

479.69 492.78 B: they have real sex shows on regular public t._v. where people are naked and and having sex and doing things and it's it's okay over there and they accept it but we don't 

490.96 491.77 A: yeah 

492.08 492.74 A: (( for )) 

492.91 493.85 B: we we 

493.31 494.30 A: some reason 

494.59 497.70 A: i know that that's what probably made us the nation we are 

499.79 506.56 A: that's why i think it did because we suppressed a lot of things and when things did do we actually used the press used it to shock us 

504.91 507.91 B: (( won't )) 

509.40 512.54 B: so how do you feel about us suppressing so much 

512.57 515.39 B: sex and other countries 

515.31 519.11 A: well sex i mean is one thing showing blood and guts is another 

519.60 520.86 A: (( you know that )) 

519.71 522.43 B: ye- yeah sure 

521.46 523.42 A: there's also you know 

523.56 527.55 A: the right way of making love and the right way and there's just screwing 

527.74 528.85 A: okay 

528.49 532.18 B: but they say all go hand in hand sex drugs and violence 

532.31 533.25 A: yes 

534.28 540.00 A: but it's not all hand in hand though there's a there's never like either y- you're for or against 

540.70 543.18 A: certain censorship certain books yes i agree 

541.41 544.29 B: (( yeah )) 

544.55 545.71 B: okay 

544.93 547.26 A: there should be censorship on coming on the books 

548.59 551.89 A: and i think the parents should actually judge on that themselves 

552.27 555.70 A: i'm not a parent i'm an uncle it's like haven't really so far 

557.11 568.43 B: but i mean would you wouldn't want to see a a dead body on t._v. if the way it was really laying there you know you'd rather see it covered up 

568.50 573.72 B: with a with a sheet or or just they told you that ten people died or 

568.90 570.15 A: well mm 

574.14 580.13 A: that's what they do tell you but i mean it the press wants to feed into it and have a feeding frenzy 

580.14 582.57 A: just gives them something to show the public 

582.64 584.15 A: to do what they want to do 

584.29 590.10 A: okay and people want to see more of it then then as this nation is of the freedom we have 

590.16 592.75 A: because i wizz as we're talking right now 

592.70 593.57 B: (( mm )) 

593.88 595.98 A: in other countries you're not allowed to do this 

596.99 599.95 B: right right you can get in trouble for talking like this 

598.06 599.27 A: okay
