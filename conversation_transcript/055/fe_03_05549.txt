219.08 233.52 B: you never go back yeah you'll never go back well yeah you hit that thirty seven year and then that thirty seven year everything just seems like it just loosens itself and um and first of all you've got to get comfortable with that but at the same time it's i think it's uh 

233.42 239.76 B: diet uh it uh as opposed to uh regular exercise i enjoy um 

239.71 248.75 B: i am at this time right now i'm a truck driver so i'm i'm driving trucks so i cl- just climbing in and out of the truck or climbing in and out of the rear of the truck you know from the ground 

248.57 258.20 B: to a commercial truck or trailer is a lot of physical work and it you know it's my muscles get tighter my knees get tigh- my um 

258.13 273.05 B: calves get tight and my um [lipsmack] my femur muscles get tight and uh uh my arms and shoulders you know they get pretty tight uh so um the trucks themselves are like power steering so they're not so hard that you're getting tight about that it's just climbing in and out of them or climbing to the back to 

262.13 262.98 A: mhm 

273.10 286.05 B: to hook up your lights and hook up your brakes and uh so u- uh y- jumping up and down on those and climbing in and out of those trucks uh three or four times a day uh you begin to to build that uh tone again you know you really 

284.31 286.13 A: do you do short hauls 

286.07 293.32 B: uh well right now i was like dropping ice i'm dropping ice right now right so i just drop it and just uh

295.91 298.40 A: right that's uh 

298.68 312.85 A: well that then that physical activity must really burn calories so you don't have to worry about mm well i would think having to you know put on weight because um doing you're pretty much doing physical activity now do you do you 

298.71 300.00 B: (( it's a well a )) 

312.79 321.86 B: lot of the guys get heavy because they the the diet that they have like their diets are like um you know they'll eat they'll stop at these uh truck stops and eat all this uh chili uh 

321.72 330.36 B: you know and chili dogs and stuff you know and then they're on their way you know and all that stuff does is make you kind of tired and stuff so my diet is like more like um

343.83 346.13 A: um see i 

346.08 359.53 A: the atkin's diet i don't know i've always always been into eating carbs like pasta or bread but i mean more and more people are saying uh you want to you know lose weight or don't want to gain too much 

359.48 366.61 A: cut off your carbs and i i i think it has a lot to do with you know personal uh wi- wi- with 

366.86 368.17 A: your genes

368.40 369.96 A: exactly 

369.40 371.20 B: (( yeah )) 

370.30 371.47 A: and uh 

371.82 378.55 A: anyway i i don't see replacing carbs with you know more red meat which could cause 

378.60 379.69 A: um 

380.06 383.34 A: you know a blockage in your in your arteries 

382.89 385.07 B: i well really um 

385.22 388.01 B: uh the uh cholesterol level 

387.83 397.24 B: um i think a little bit of protein red meat um as long as it's done in like maybe t- two two or three times a week 

392.84 393.86 A: mhm 

394.68 396.47 A: oh yeah not to excess 

397.04 403.27 B: and as long as you're uh you know you're not you're not sitting around doing nothing becoming just a lump 

403.18 412.62 B: uh uh and you're out there and you're being active uh and uh and you're stimulating you're thoughts and your your mind and b- by being active um 

403.24 404.35 A: right 

412.45 423.43 B: it it doesn't have a tendency to like uh slow me down anyway so at this point and i'm i'm you know like i said two or three times a week i'll have a steak or i'll have pasta but uh i stay at one eighty 

420.16 420.94 A: mhm

429.72 436.00 B: i i don't fluctuate too much if i do fluctuate y- i get self conscious about it especially at this time of year when i'm drinking 

435.79 444.90 B: i might think about drinking a soda and i'll say no hold on we'll drink water instead uh because uh uh that all that's going to do is put on calories and so 

439.90 440.86 A: (( right so )) 

444.92 452.22 B: and i think if i don't uh add calories then physically i stay fit i stay pretty fit uh as long as i watch the calories

546.53 551.12 B: [noise] um i uh picked it up on uh um
