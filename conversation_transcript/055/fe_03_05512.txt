5.37 6.83 B: hey my name's robert 

7.17 11.34 A: robert i didn't quite hear the uh the topic of the day i was outside on the street 

11.39 20.41 B: oh they were talking about whether schools should private or public schools should be allowed to allowed to censor what kids uh read 

20.30 21.55 A: really 

21.33 23.44 B: yeah that was the topic for today 

23.89 25.56 A: read like uh 

25.92 27.92 B: like read a book kind of thing 

27.48 31.90 A: yeah read on their own accord or read uh from what they distribute to them 

31.86 33.26 B: they didn't say 

33.62 35.88 B: they just said what they 

36.11 47.60 B: have access to or what they read they didn't give a whether it was a book in class or whether it was an assignment or whether it's what's in the library or whether what they can bring in their backpack it didn't really say any of that kind of stuff 

47.73 50.68 A: huh i imagine it's the stuff that they give to them i guess 

50.86 51.96 B: yeah 

51.35 55.90 A: no actually it's probably the stuff that they uh bring to school on their own but uh 

55.19 64.54 B: yeah i mean it could be any of those i mean you know they can they ban people with little yu-gi-oh books and their yu-gi-oh cards because they don't like them or like the little kids or 

62.53 63.78 A: right right 

65.02 66.16 A: um 

66.31 68.09 A: (( uh i )) 

69.08 73.56 A: i uh you know unless it's harmful to other people i don't see uh 

73.57 78.46 A: why it should be censored but i guess that's a sort of censorship in itself but um 

78.66 82.69 A: um are are you part of the study or are you just another person doing this 

83.14 90.28 B: i'm just another i mean i signed up to do the thing for the ten bucks but i'm not like a teacher or anything i'm from palholme detroit

102.93 106.39 A: do do you know why exactly we're supposed to be talking about this at all 

106.49 116.34 B: i think they're doing actually i think what it is is they're just interested in like where you grew up and what state you were born in and stuff that they're looking 

116.41 120.16 B: at some kind of linguistic thing to see like 

120.42 134.08 B: [noise] you know like you know the stereotype about new yorkers being all pushy or people from mid west being laid back or you know i think it's something to do with like how the conversation goes if the topic don't really mean anything what 

124.96 126.33 A: oh i see now 

127.32 128.19 A: [laughter] 

131.68 133.12 A: (( they don't really matter )) 

133.93 137.90 A: it it they don't really matter they're just trying to see like how people communicate 

137.97 142.12 B: yeah that's that's the impression i got in reading it yeah that that was what 

141.00 142.02 A: okay 

142.32 149.42 B: you know and and so they said they want you to spend like you know three quarters of the time trying to talk about one of the topics so that they can 

149.55 159.46 B: see how people discuss things or see how our speech patterns whatever it is but it's the topics are just there to be the topics they're not real important you know 

152.25 153.30 A: (( right )) 

157.21 158.18 A: right 

158.73 161.39 A: (( so i guess they're recording this or something ))

187.46 192.80 B: you know but yeah man i'm not that big on that whole censorship thing either it's like you know it's kind of a 

193.28 198.10 B: (( kinda tacky i don't think there's a whole probably we don't have a whole lot to argue about with that )) 

197.50 204.02 A: i i i wonder if it's a real thing that they're actually is that going on or if it's really gone on but um 

204.38 213.98 A: i'm just curious about the motives behind the people who are trying to do that and why i mean i i'm really not educated upon it so i it's hard for me to speak and i don't like speaking about things i don't know 

213.98 215.21 B: yeah 

214.62 215.54 A: (( you know )) 

215.64 221.93 B: yeah well i guess that i i you know reading it it was it seemed to be from the university of pennsylvania from looking at the 

221.32 222.30 A: right 

221.69 232.57 B: the stuff on it and it seemed legit you know and it's like it it appeared from like i say 'cause they were focused on where you grew up and where you you know i i'm thinking it's 

233.16 242.23 B: it's uh people going back and forth and then they said they were getting like way too many women for it but like they had three women for every guy so they needed more guys to do it 

240.61 246.48 A: no no no i'm i'm speaking about the actual the topic that you're just talking about 

245.64 251.82 B: oh the topic yeah i mean some people seem to be you know they really want to keep stuff away from their kids and 

251.62 252.64 A: right 

251.92 259.43 B: you know i mean living in indiana when i was there there was a lot of that kind of stuff going on i mean they would constantly be complaining about 

256.15 257.21 A: right right 

259.34 274.83 B: books in the schools and trying to get rid of them [noise] and they'd be going after kids even here in detroit they had some girl had some like and stuff she brought in when she was in high school and they tried to take it away from her and she sued them and won and everything you know so 

262.85 263.78 A: right 

274.17 275.41 A: [laughter] shit 

275.68 276.94 B: yeah 

276.32 278.78 A: [laughter] why i 

277.62 279.93 B: (( and she sued them )) 

279.02 286.50 A: don't know it i don't know it seems like when when that that's everything our country stands against is is stuff doing stuff like that so 

286.65 287.39 A: (( so i )) 

286.67 291.78 B: (( yeah but you know your different parts of the country it's not the same i mean that's the )) 

290.92 292.34 A: yeah true true 

292.21 301.43 B: you know because like you said i i mean you know i'm more or less part of the reason i moved to michigan it's a lot more i'd say politically liberal than indiana is but 

300.70 302.01 A: right 

301.71 305.81 B: you know and my actual one of my best friends from law school was is lives in uh 

306.02 309.60 B: uh brooklyn now she was she just moved back there from 

309.64 311.95 B: uh [noise] yonkers or whatever but it's like

322.96 326.04 B: well one is lawyering is not the uh 

326.41 335.49 B: the uh ritzy undertaking that people think it is the other it just seemed like fun i mean i was like doing studies when i was in college anyway getting some money for them 

334.60 335.93 A: (( huh [laughter] )) 

335.54 349.54 B: and this was pretty easy i mean they just call you at home but i'm you know i work for the for the government here and you know i guess most lawyering is not the the lucrative profession for everybody there's the small percentage that are making big bucks and 

346.80 347.85 A: true 

348.93 350.12 A: sure sure 

349.94 352.78 B: it's not the it's not a cash field or whatever

356.70 357.53 B: [noise] 

357.84 362.24 B: yeah if you can get one i mean like my friend in new york still is not working as a lawyer uh

418.70 420.22 B: oh no problem 

419.77 420.81 A: (( sorry man )) 

421.31 426.73 A: yeah i'm a little bit biased on lawyers as far as that goes uh i guess because my parents just got through a divorce and uh 

426.82 432.27 A: and now i i know not all lawyers are fucked up but uh well the marriage ones i think are 

432.27 435.46 B: oh yeah they they can make a lot of money most people 

434.43 441.60 A: i think yeah i think it's their their their purpose is not to accom- you know accommodate their their clients but more to uh uh 

442.10 448.31 A: make as much money and like rip as much money out of their clients' pockets as possible 

448.04 460.06 B: oh yeah i would agree and and the people that you know most of the people try family law they don't have the stomach for it but the ones that do can make big bucks with it i mean that's why people quit it it's not because there's not lots of business 

454.70 455.67 A: yeah 

456.95 458.24 A: oh yeah 

459.85 472.02 A: and they like i i think purposely cause rifts just to draw things out and just play each person against the other if they can if it's the right situation but um 

470.98 483.39 B: yep or they take a whole lot of money here is the thing i've seen is if they think you've got the money they get a lot of money up front and then they just wait around and the two of them like go in some back room and settle everything and tell them well this is the best you're gonna get 

483.17 490.20 B: you know or else give me another five thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars you know and then they kinda say oh well okay you already took all money you know 

483.20 484.04 A: right 

486.89 488.01 A: yeah 

489.87 492.16 A: right eventually 

490.98 494.70 B: i mean that's what i've seem in my own experience out here with it 

494.56 496.37 A: my parents i think they uh 

496.41 502.46 A: they just realized that they were just gonna be giving all their money to lawyers and they they came to their senses and just settled but uh 

498.42 499.20 B: [noise]
