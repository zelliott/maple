266.41 267.55 B: yeah 

266.74 268.95 A: that's the government the way they treat us 

269.11 283.82 B: exactly exactly but i mean i'll tell you another way i mean for instance we actually just moved offices i work right across from the empire state building and we looked at office space in the empire state building it was a beautiful office space um 

270.24 271.20 A: (( mm-kay )) 

282.90 285.52 A: but you don't want didn't want to move into it

286.27 287.18 A: yes 

286.66 287.58 B: i mean 

287.63 299.09 B: that's just [laughter] you know another example of and other- and otherwise y- three years ago we might've loved to move into that place you know it was a great view of downtown manhattan and yeah 

296.34 298.22 A: oh yes beautiful 

298.48 300.12 A: i'm not asking that one minute 

299.27 304.21 B: [laughter] and here we are you know across the street um on the eleventh floor 

304.17 307.53 A: yes but here we are buying coffee from arabs 

307.67 311.59 A: okay who are the v- um the i mean you don't know what these guys do 

311.70 316.20 A: how many palestinians ah what do you call it i mean or arab palestinians as cab drivers 

316.79 323.11 A: immigration gave 'em their their papers after i mean your freedoms i mean all our freedoms are completely different 

323.31 324.92 B: yeah that's definitely true 

324.94 327.52 A: i mean it's it's completely ah 

327.70 329.96 A: i just hate the way they destroyed our freedom 

330.26 334.98 A: and what i feel is what we did what what happened to the last people that crashed planes in our territory 

336.78 338.38 B: what would happen 

337.81 341.92 A: what happened to the last people that cla- crashed crashed planes on u._s. soil 

341.32 342.09 B: who was 

342.44 346.04 B: (( that )) 

342.53 343.77 A: japanese 

345.46 349.24 A: no offence just that would shut everyone up excuse me russia 

349.25 351.72 A: (( why don't you go and just shut up afghanistan )) 

352.22 353.61 A: that's what they should a did 

353.72 355.80 A: (( the whole world would a shut the fuck up )) 

355.81 358.90 A: excuse my language but the whole world would a just went oh fuck 

356.69 357.80 B: [laughter] 

359.01 362.66 A: america's not screwing around anymore we can't play terrorism with them 

362.60 368.56 B: yeah i think the problem though with this is that that was i- in that case it was i mean it was a clear 

368.58 370.36 B: the enemy was you know 

371.86 381.43 B: very obvious and in our face whereas you know we're not necessarily talking about all afghanistani people actually the ah you know the people that were involved were 

379.85 385.62 A: i know that but to make an omelet okay you have to break a couple of eggs and that's what they did 

386.92 387.91 A: okay 

388.62 390.45 A: we lost how many thousand people 

391.66 392.54 B: true 

391.95 403.33 A: human people not military military's something different pearl harbor was something different we lost civilians we lost children in that thing and then we go ah show the pictures of the kids that fucking died in that thing 

395.56 396.66 B: civilians 

403.51 405.62 A: okay see how people feel then 

405.50 407.69 B: [cough] yeah exactly [cough] 

407.09 415.39 A: okay th- they didn't tell you there was kids there i know someone who was eight months pregnant ready to have a kid the m- next day next month okay died with her husband in that building 

415.93 416.75 B: yeah 

415.94 428.04 A: i worked from that building okay i was working in that building a year before that i had security clearance okay big bars gates they work their way around it they were able to go they will go after the white house in the other plane they crashed that plane those people give 'em credit 

428.56 430.22 B: definitely 

429.65 432.32 A: (( and i don't i feel a lotta freedoms our freedoms are screwed now )) 

433.14 434.00 B: yeah 

433.20 442.49 A: 'cause now the government could tap in on anything we wanna talk about they could listen to anything we wanna do anything they could have a freedoms in fact if you feel you're a terrorist could to walk into anywhere they want 

442.69 453.46 B: right well do you think do you think any of the steps that they've taken i mean do you think they've been effective or do you think it's just infringing on our freedoms and okay what do you think about that 

451.09 452.31 A: well 

452.74 454.59 A: (( infringing on our freedoms )) 

454.87 457.26 B: i mean you don't think i mean do do you think it's 

457.51 464.10 B: mostly useless you know for instance the additional security at at airports the armed guards in the in the subway 

462.57 465.43 A: we should never give 'em the benefit of the doubt 

466.85 468.59 B: give who the benefit of the doubt 

466.98 468.22 A: we should never 

468.46 471.61 A: we should just we sh- should live our freedoms the way we did 

471.82 472.41 A: (( [noise] )) 

473.33 476.10 A: 'cause now we're spending so much money on security 

478.13 479.08 A: (( for what )) 

480.20 490.64 B: so [laughter] i'm getting the impression that you don't necessarily feel any safer now with all the additional precautions and the additional money that's 

487.28 488.44 A: (( please if they )) 

489.10 493.48 A: they if if you were to seen the security that went through going to the trade center 

493.55 495.49 A: they crashed planes into it after 

495.83 498.20 A: i mean they work a way around it 

498.96 499.83 B: right 

499.07 504.99 A: we were a rebel nation at one time we worked our way to fight to get to our freedoms 

505.20 510.54 A: okay we didn't stop us we just kept on going about our lives after it 

511.81 514.70 A: what happens now is is we lost it all 

517.47 526.13 B: yeah i i don't i don't necessarily i do- don't necessarily feel as as extremely as you do i mean i don't necessarily think it's it's lost i mean there's certain 

525.10 530.02 A: i just don't like looking in the subway and seeing guys with machine guns i've been you know 

530.25 532.62 A: out there i've been in the military so it's like 

534.39 537.96 A: it's what you feel i mean it's like y- you're not supposed to see this in your home land 

537.36 540.74 B: though you see it in like a third [laughter] world country right you have a 

539.46 541.62 A: yeah you see that in a third world country 

541.43 543.73 B: you walk out in an airport and you know

555.54 557.06 B: (( yeah i mean it's )) 

557.13 558.53 A: it's pretty scary 

558.65 559.76 B: definitely 

558.94 561.96 A: think about it i mean and say if one of these guys snap 

562.56 563.77 A: due to stress 

564.56 567.96 A: how many people are i mean we our army how many people i mean 

568.44 569.54 A: in this country 

571.16 571.99 B: yeah 

571.35 575.64 A: how do we know these guys are safe how do you know they're not it's not them we're a military state now 

577.34 584.70 A: we can't smoke in bars no offence that's a whole different topic but i mean we can't i mean think about it we could pay tax on the alcohol but because of terrorists pay a 

580.26 581.11 B: [laughter] 

585.55 587.68 A: pack of cigarettes cost forty cents for people 

588.18 599.92 A: okay but we're paying taxes up the we we're a military we've become so much of a military state we have the same laws gun laws okay as we as hitler did during world war two 

589.55 590.11 B: (( [cough] ))
