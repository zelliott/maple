85.76 86.81 A: (( such as )) 

87.11 88.08 B: (( well )) 

89.55 95.57 B: uh x. rated movies shouldn't be shown on family television for instance 

95.58 96.90 A: they aren't though 

96.91 99.73 B: they aren't that's censorship 

98.52 100.89 A: but no one opposes that you know 

101.14 111.89 B: no opposed to but it is a form of censorship i'm sure i'm sure um what's his name that runs hustler magazine would like to show his pictures on 

104.39 105.85 A: yeah sure 

111.99 114.03 B: prime time television 

113.79 115.33 A: larry flynn [noise]

117.08 118.35 B: larry flynn 

117.45 118.32 A: yeah 

118.55 123.63 A: mhm i don't know if he's tried um 

121.32 124.44 B: uh he wouldn't try he couldn't censored 

123.84 130.21 A: yeah um how about books books in classrooms how do you feel about the censorship 

132.68 146.24 B: that's a that's a that's a interesting thing i imagine there is a certain amount of discrimination on that i don't know if you call it censorship or not how far do you go on calling it censorship 

140.48 141.71 A: (( with that )) 

144.09 148.98 A: religious books that people can't read and this and that you know 

148.80 152.23 B: for instance they don't preach that uh man was 

153.25 154.83 B: was uh 

155.13 161.98 B: born according to the new test- the old test- according to the bible they preach evolution 

162.35 164.05 B: in science 

162.43 163.49 A: (( uh-huh )) 

164.33 169.72 B: in in schools is that a form of censorship 

167.90 173.57 A: well they talk about the possibilities of both they don't they don't say that one's right and one's wrong i don't think 

173.51 185.56 B: well they banned the ten commandments on public buildings that's censorship 

178.89 180.12 A: well yeah 

180.40 184.92 A: i guess i guess you could say that but uh for instance 

185.16 186.23 A: (( um i )) 

187.18 188.09 A: (( don't know )) 

188.16 198.83 A: like some books teachers are censors almost in a way 'cause they they they chose what to show or what what not to show or what to read or not to read so they really act as censors too 

199.17 207.42 B: right te- education is a censorship of sorts because they discriminate against what's taught and what isn't taught 

203.10 203.75 A: yeah 

207.19 208.90 A: yeah exactly 

209.82 212.74 A: so uh that's definitely a valid point 

214.16 216.48 A: (( i don't know how you feel about that )) 

217.08 220.02 A: (( yeah um and and yeah )) 

218.85 225.42 B: [noise] like church believes in censorship i'm sure of that 

222.77 224.12 A: yeah of course 

224.75 227.75 A: of course um yeah 

228.12 229.60 A: so anything else 

231.09 238.86 B: i imagine a lot of churches a book censor anything that would ha- have anything to do with abortion 

239.21 240.21 A: uh-huh 

240.88 245.32 B: but uh the government doesn't allow it they allow free speech 

245.64 246.72 A: yeah 

248.30 250.69 A: and you're saying it's wrong that schools don't 

251.03 252.10 B: what 

252.11 255.95 A: you think it's wrong that schools don't allow allow free speech 

258.19 259.12 B: (( what's )) 

259.28 260.85 B: censorship isn't it 

261.51 267.13 A: uh yeah not allowing it yeah and you think that's so that's wrong that's a big problem 

268.08 269.53 A: free speech and 

268.62 273.57 B: i guess you have to decide how far you're going to go with censorship 

273.75 275.05 A: (( yeah )) 

275.92 279.85 A: seriously i guess that's really that's really the fact of it huh 

281.75 283.45 A: think we cracked this one 

284.95 292.05 A: um yeah i don't know what else to really say about this but we gotta keep talking 

293.02 297.22 A: um censorship is a bad thing in schools 

298.59 300.64 B: well censorship for 

302.97 313.96 B: everything comes in our in our society everything is brought out and then mumbo jumbos if people don't like it 

303.07 303.98 A: what's that 

312.03 313.73 A: yeah definitely 

313.82 324.28 B: and then it becomes a big blur and nobody knows what anybody's talking about and it was just something that was said and washed over 

324.68 329.55 A: yeah yeah so give me a couple more uh instances where uh particular 

328.78 332.97 B: well for instance we'll take england for instance uh 

333.21 334.61 B: uh 

335.40 337.10 B: tony blair 

337.59 342.62 B: was supposed to have hyped up the um 

343.43 346.16 B: weapons of mass destruction 

346.22 349.56 B: (( so that they could go to war with iraq )) 

349.35 350.26 A: (( mhm )) 

349.78 352.90 B: recently and the and the 

351.11 352.00 A: (( mhm )) 

354.06 360.36 B: the uh house of commons it was just tories and the people all said that he 

360.86 369.31 B: uh did that and then and then they then then the other parties that lied maybe he did maybe he didn't 

369.31 380.48 B: well maybe he didn't and they ha- they blurted it around and and now it's kind of got to the point where maybe he did and maybe he didn't but sort of like he did 

380.39 381.46 A: mhm 

380.52 387.18 B: and sort of like george w. bush did the same thing but they didn't ha- but that wasn't censored 

384.45 386.50 A: (( how do you relate that to censorship )) 

387.51 389.88 B: but it was blurred over 

389.74 390.90 A: (( oh ooh )) 

391.57 393.65 A: got it so it was censored 

395.89 396.94 A: yeah

399.22 401.04 B: in england a 

400.66 401.41 A: (( so it's )) 

401.00 414.24 B: free kind of free world it and a dictatorship a dictator can't stand truth because he doesn't have the wherewithal to to answer it it becomes an inflamed thing so he has to 

411.05 411.96 A: yeah
