91.48 99.50 B: wow i what can i say i'm sorry to hear that but is there like [mn] so there's no way for you that you can exercise any muscles or anything 

99.17 102.64 A: oh i guess i could do some you know uh some uh 

103.19 113.59 A: some uh maybe some upper body stuff uh maybe some weights or something like that uh but uh as far as anything that uh 

113.84 118.52 A: involves lifting um like from the floor i couldn't do that at all 

118.67 120.40 B: yeah i got it

131.23 133.63 A: (( what about you do you exercise )) 

133.67 136.01 B: well i exercise um 

137.06 139.94 B: i run every morning um 

139.42 141.28 A: you run every morning 

140.73 144.36 B: which is somewhere between six thirty a._m. to 

144.62 152.17 B: eight a._m. depends on how tired and how late i go to bed at night uh i run for 

148.37 149.65 A: oh i see 

153.29 160.37 B: in between two point eight and three point five miles every morning uh or at least i try to stick to that uh 

156.45 158.42 A: oh really well 

160.09 161.58 A: yeah 

160.99 167.80 B: i cannot tell you that i can do it every day 'cause i would lie but i do it at least four days a week 

167.55 169.74 A: what part of the country do you live in 

169.85 173.18 B: uh right now i live in washington d._c. 

172.42 178.78 A: washington d._c. well a- a- is the weather up there conducive to running every morning or do y- [laughter] 

178.04 190.07 B: uh [laughter] it's not been too conducive of running every morning because of the rain that we've been getting uh for the past two months but uh i don't care i mean i run in 

179.90 180.58 A: (( hah )) 

183.24 184.23 A: yeah 

185.80 186.91 A: yeah 

190.16 197.46 B: i at least i'm lucky 'cause it's warm so even if it's raining i don't mind i i i do my schedule yeah 

194.87 196.81 A: oh really yeah 

196.69 199.60 A: well i live uh i live down here in texas 

199.37 211.90 A: and uh the heat down here is quite oppressive in fact it's probably still in the nineties outside it's about ten o'clock at night here and it's probably still in the nineties [laughter] makes it a little difficult 

205.89 207.18 B: oh my god 

211.80 214.70 B: oh my god yeah it does it does make it 

212.79 213.55 A: (( but )) 

213.49 219.74 A: i couldn't do it anyway but it makes it difficult for the people who do like to run i see them running by my house 

219.62 230.78 A: i live in a a fairly nice neighborhood and i see joggers out in the morning running by my house and sometimes i wish i could join them bu- [laughter] but for walking more than running 

228.13 229.19 B: (( [mn] )) 

230.89 238.19 B: [laughter] my god it i mean if you tell me that it's ninety five right now outside running 

238.42 240.39 B: would probably make that 

239.82 252.20 A: [laughter] yeah it uh i- it really gets in the summertime uh we have oh i don't know we have a number of days where it's well over one hundred and i remember uh 

242.03 243.25 B: (( seem even more )) 

252.31 263.84 A: i remember one year it got up to about a hundred and thirteen here and we had about forty days of uh above a hundred degrees weather every day 

263.95 264.87 B: huh 

264.94 268.15 A: makes it tough do you do any kind of weightlifting or anything 

267.91 273.94 B: uh i don't i don't do any weightlifting i used to do that 'cause i uh i used to swim 

271.02 272.01 A: yeah 

273.98 280.29 B: i was in a special school for swimming when i was a kid uh for ten years yes and uh 

276.87 277.90 A: oh really 

279.14 279.98 A: (( mhm )) 

280.54 288.45 B: uh but that was out the that that was outside um the u._s. that was in europe um i am originally romanian 

288.09 289.67 A: oh romanian 

289.47 293.42 B: yes [laughter] aha a romanian [laughter] 

292.45 295.10 A: [laughter] 

293.70 307.25 B: [mn] and um i went to a i went to this swimming school for ten years where i would swim every day and then do um a f- you know just a little bit of weightlifting it was not part of our training but 

306.43 313.85 A: well i understand swimming is a great exercise uh i understand it exercises practically every muscle in your body 

313.67 322.66 B: it is great uh it is great but you have to you have to be um um con- consistent in your uh 

315.17 316.34 A: yeah 

316.49 317.23 A: but 

322.83 329.13 B: in your training 'cause otherwise you lose um we used to call it the uh the water contact 

323.80 324.71 A: right 

329.17 330.12 A: uh-huh 

329.35 334.45 B: 'cause it's even if you are a very experienced swimmer and you swim for instance um 

334.73 344.24 B: for two years or for five years or for ten years and then you stop for three months the first time you get in the water 

337.93 338.80 A: right 

344.75 346.15 B: uh you have 

346.43 352.74 B: a tough time doing what you thought you can do for the first few days for the first few days 

349.43 354.97 A: oh i see yeah just from just from being away from it for a while 

354.78 356.11 B: exactly 

355.42 365.66 A: i used to be a good swimmer and i love to swim when i was younger and i i could probably still swim pretty good it might be something i might look into uh swimming as a form of exercise 

365.36 371.91 B: that was exactly what i was about to ask you uh with your back problem i mean uh isn't swimming one of your options at least 

371.82 380.98 A: uh i think uh i think i could probably do that okay without you know uh possibility of injuring my back or anything i think i could probably do that 

380.56 389.82 B: yeah so what now that you know because now obviously you cannot exercise too much but what did you used to do before uh in terms of exercising 

381.29 382.04 A: (( uh )) 

390.24 397.89 A: oh when i was younger i was always running around doing things uh i i i i played uh a lot of oh 

397.70 407.03 A: i tried tennis for a while [laughter] wasn't really my sport 'cause i wasn't any good at it but i tried a little bit of handball and stuff like that uh bu- and 

403.96 405.09 B: [laughter] 

405.56 406.59 B: [laughter] 

407.21 409.98 A: it was enjoyable but uh i it 

410.04 416.26 A: i never stuck with it for very long because you know it it just got boring to me after a while 

416.43 417.34 B: huh 

417.70 419.98 B: so and other than tennis 

419.99 424.66 A: uh yeah i've i used to play uh a little bit of tennis yeah 

424.25 425.41 B: tennis huh 

425.56 429.40 B: yeah that's that's nice uh uh i see 

430.06 436.39 B: tennis used to be a pretty cool sport uh i i've i haven't played too much tennis in my life i've played a few times and i 

436.45 438.81 B: i am completely challenged if you're 

438.18 442.80 A: yeah well i never was really good at tennis but i enjoyed uh 

438.89 440.36 B: [laughter] if you can 

442.65 453.95 A: i enjoyed uh hitting the balls and a lot of times just hitting against a a back board you know rather than playing with a partner just hitting the ball against the back board and letting it return to me 

453.56 461.28 B: [laughter] yeah yeah well you know [mn] it's it's really strange for me for instance 

462.16 468.70 B: let me tell what amazes me sometimes about about uh about fitness [laughter] and uh 

463.78 464.66 A: okay 

469.81 476.97 B: and people who who train [noise] um a lot of a lot of times i go to uh 

477.87 481.94 B: to the gym and i see people running on a treadmill [laughter] 

480.83 481.97 A: (( uh-huh )) 

482.12 489.52 B: and that kinda makes me wondering why would somebody want to really run on a treadmill if they could just run outside 

489.39 491.28 A: right exactly 

489.96 490.50 B: (( a- )) 

491.11 493.45 B: have you every wondered abo- i mean have you ever 

494.03 501.78 A: yeah i wondered about that and uh a lot of people like the stationary bicycles too you know and that's kind of in the same category there 

494.28 495.13 B: yeah 

501.54 502.80 B: exactly 

502.23 506.22 A: why not just get you a real bike and ride out on the street 

505.64 519.18 B: [noise] exactly well it might yeah some people might say well it's dangerous and you know all this stuff but you have bike trails especially here in d._c. we have a lot of bike trails i bike every now and then but biking is not a part of my uh usual exercise we just 

514.09 514.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

517.50 523.92 A: yeah we have a lot of bike trails around here too and they're they're plenty safe you know and everything 

523.44 524.43 B: yeah 

525.07 533.33 B: but you know uh it re- [laughter] probably at this time of year uh of the year it would be kind of difficult to bike also if 

532.96 534.00 A: uh-huh 

533.85 537.28 B: if you if you're telling me you have over a hundred degrees during the day 

536.67 548.38 A: right [laughter] well huh we're just now getting into our really hot weather it's uh uh w- you know and i- our hottest weather is usually in august but it starts in july 

537.80 538.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

548.80 549.70 B: huh 

550.17 551.28 B: that's that's 

551.57 553.01 B: (( it you know )) 

553.36 567.25 B: do you do you notice every any difference in ter- in in the in the number of people who run for instance with the joggers that you see every morning do you see them uh more often in certain months of the year or do you see them uh 

566.24 574.36 A: uh they they they run year round the ones i see they run year round but i do see more of them i think in the cooler months 

574.29 586.84 A: um uh than than and they usually run in the morning fairly early a- or late in the evening uh and rarely in the middle of the day do i see any of them 

587.17 588.21 B: (( [laughter] )) 

588.34 595.67 B: so it's yeah they're [laughter] they're running from the heat 'cause i've i've seen in washington for instance today i saw a lot of them um 

595.70 596.85 B: ru- running 

597.00 599.95 B: um in the middle of the day there was literally
