60.49 61.21 B: (( [noise] ))

66.96 68.99 B: (( [noise] well that's good [noise] )) 

69.09 81.37 A: so yes i try and do it as regular as possible i don't do it every day because i heard that's not good for you but doing it every other day you know it keeps you in it keeps you in shape it keeps you in pretty good shape and i don't i don't swim too much because i'm not around too 

69.63 70.29 B: (( i )) 

71.05 72.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

81.41 85.08 A: (( pool areas or anything like that but i )) 

84.02 96.54 B: well i know that uh my brother used to [noise] uh like jog two miles every day and he ended up like even though he like ate at mcdonalds or whatever would lose a pound a day 

96.95 97.90 B: so 

97.00 111.32 A: well yeah yeah mcdonalds is very fattening and you can't you can't eat heavy and exercise that does that doesn't do anything it's just it's just at best you're probably just balancing everything out you know what i'm saying but if you're you're if you're exercising to lose weight then you should probably eat accordingly 

100.02 100.78 B: [noise] 

102.65 104.55 B: (( not yet )) 

107.00 108.78 B: yeah 

111.54 112.85 A: you know which means 

111.80 115.09 B: well exactly [noise] 

113.12 118.67 A: yeah don't stuff yourself don't eat you know mcdonalds is very fatty i think everybody knows that that's with no 

117.67 121.23 B: oh yeah yeah you hear about that lawsuit with those kids cheek 

120.61 121.85 A: yeah 

121.76 123.10 A: you know it's it's it's 

122.02 122.70 B: [noise] 

123.02 136.80 A: just high in all that stuff and so yeah exercising and eating mcdonalds you probably wouldn't lose a lot of weight and uh uh in a short amount of time but if you're exercising and i'm not saying cut out junk food completely because you know you can maybe then you know eat a little stuff but 

134.51 135.22 B: mm 

136.58 145.92 A: eat try try and mix in a little bit of everything and only eat when you're hungry that's that's the best way to i think lose weight exercise and only eat when you're hungry and don't stuff yourself 

140.18 141.84 B: yeah 

146.09 148.71 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah like i mean when you look at like the atkins diet 

148.62 149.47 A: yeah 

148.82 161.27 B: i mean [noise] okay so my joke is you know [noise] what guy is going to uh object to you know the all protein diet ha ha ha but i mean the truth is if you want to lose weight 

157.86 158.59 A: (( uh-huh )) 

161.30 175.13 B: all you've got to do is do a little bit of exercise and watch what you eat it's not all that difficult you don't need to buy a book you don't need to go to seminars just exercise a little and you know watch what you eat 

166.15 167.00 A: yeah 

175.61 179.69 A: yeah but some people don't know exactly what uh what's good and what's bad i mean 

179.83 181.58 A: a lot of people don't know that drinking 

181.66 183.26 A: soda can actually 

183.40 187.78 A: hurt you trying to lose weight they think you know they think that as long as they exercise enough it'll 

187.90 200.72 A: you know it'll balance out and sometimes it will and sometimes it won't but if you're trying to lose weight that's not the best way to go about it because if people don't really know what they can and can't eat what's going to put them over what's going to hurt them or what's going to help them 

199.86 200.92 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

200.79 207.22 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well i guess that's that's true but i mean mm uh part of the problem that's true some people are just 

201.16 202.46 A: so i think 

203.46 204.18 A: (( if )) 

207.14 216.40 B: like well i'm juts gonna eat salads well salads are all well and good but there are other parts of food groups that you need to have as well 

213.13 219.56 A: yes but they want to be safe i think they wanna be safe so they don't eat anything but salads and fruit are the best ways to go 

219.95 227.49 A: you know it basically is it's like eating the obvious foods that they think will have to put on weight that they they they try to avoid like meat or whatever like that and 

226.93 231.04 B: yeah i don't exactly see malnourish your way to slimness [noise] 

230.41 242.61 A: yeah or you know they calorie count which i don't think is very good i think the best way to lose all you gotta do one of the best way is just eat when you're hungry though 'cause when you when you starve yourself you know how your eyes get bigger than your mouth 

231.56 232.15 B: (( uh )) 

234.54 235.20 B: (( mm )) 

242.65 243.78 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

243.00 244.10 A: (( and and )) 

244.34 248.00 A: and you want and you want a lot more that you than you think you can take in 

246.71 249.72 B: (( yeah )) 

249.00 255.82 A: (( and you wind up either throwing it away or stuffing yourself so that you don't have to throw it away 'cause you know you're going have to try that later you know )) 

255.60 269.68 B: mm [noise] yeah i i got to say i tried fasting once for like you know a few days just to see what it was like right [noise] and i'm a big guy i'm six foot four [noise] by the end by the end of like the third day i was having trouble lifting thirty pounds 

260.89 261.77 A: uh-huh 

264.32 265.18 A: (( uh-huh )) 

269.74 270.59 A: wow 

271.22 278.61 B: i mean that's extreme and as soon as i ate something it was like oh energy oh ah hey this is good [noise] 

272.32 272.86 A: (( oh )) 

276.78 277.85 A: [laughter] 

278.08 279.03 A: yeah 

280.28 281.25 B: (( ah )) 

280.69 281.43 A: uh 

281.51 283.88 A: (( uh i don- i don't know i mean my mother who )) 

283.99 287.42 A: has been she lost she lost weight and she lost it using weight watchers 

288.68 293.90 A: and that's um that's basically a lot of you know they use point systems you know certain food 

293.49 294.05 B: [noise] 

294.00 301.83 A: you know they they uh they monitor they they they find out your height your age and your weight right now and they determine that upon how many points you can eat a a day 

300.75 303.13 B: hm [noise] [noise] uh 

303.13 314.05 A: and each you know each food group has a each food has a point and she had to stay within her points range and exercise regularly if she wants to lose weight and it worked you know she lost i think she lost like fifty pounds in two months 

308.11 309.50 B: (( [noise] )) 

314.86 321.95 A: (( so you know it worked well but she spent a lot of that time starving herself you know not i mean not starving herself but she could if she went over her points )) 

315.16 316.02 B: (( i know )) 

322.13 336.04 A: uh like say she ate something one thing that was like her points were between twenty and twenty five right so she ate let's say her entire breakfast that she ate was like between twenty and twenty five points altogether she would have to really not eat that entire the rest of the day 

326.99 328.74 B: right 

335.26 340.71 B: (( yeah )) 

336.00 338.41 A: and so sometimes that would be a real pain for her 

339.06 342.64 A: so she really had to monitor what she ate and make sure she didn't eat too much of it 

343.49 344.81 A: and exercise regular 

343.61 344.76 B: [noise] i know 

345.18 349.32 B: (( [noise] i know with my mother she actually right hold on a second i'm going to s- light a cigarette )) 

349.48 350.14 B: (( hm )) 

351.63 353.27 B: i know with my mother 

353.52 361.93 B: she actually had to get surgery [noise] she had her stomach stapled and a goodly portion of her intestines removed because that way 

360.70 361.43 A: (( oh )) 

362.11 369.95 B: you'd get less digesting as well as lessening your stomach [noise] and it actually she lost like a hundred and fifty pounds from that [noise] 

365.77 366.43 A: (( wow )) 

368.82 369.65 A: (( wow )) 

370.03 374.04 B: (( the problem is that after that she was kind of starved and she's still pretty big )) 

374.02 387.09 B: [noise] but [noise] like stomach stapling i don't know i mean i don't like the idea but on the other hand i mean you get to eat as much as you like um you know you eat until you get full and it's not as much 

387.25 388.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

388.19 400.60 B: [noise] again like i'm a big guy so i have i have to eat a lot to feel nice and comfortable the way most people do and so most people look at me and like he's such a pig i'm not a pig i've got like a larger stomach than you do 

394.78 396.97 A: yeah yeah 

399.79 401.87 A: yeah yeah 

401.98 403.61 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

402.38 408.99 A: like like when we first did i used to weigh i'm i'm like six foot one and i used to weigh two hundred and fifty pounds now i weigh one seventy five 

409.57 417.19 A: and the way i lost it was because i i was like you know since i was a teenager i was i was kind of like pudgy but i was i was in the football team 'cause that was kind of my thing 

414.88 418.15 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

417.88 422.53 A: (( and when i graduated from high school it was just you know there was no need for me to be that big any more so )) 

422.55 423.22 B: (( mm )) 

423.32 424.40 A: (( and i kinda just )) 

423.47 425.00 B: but i'm like 

425.12 435.67 B: i'm six foot four i used to i was i used to be like a little beach ball but high school was like [noise] fencing and ballet and all this shit and it was like oh hey i'm thin 

435.89 436.60 B: uh 

436.08 437.14 A: [laughter] 

437.28 444.43 B: is that ten minutes oh wait hold on a second [noise] uh don't worry about it sorry uh incoming call anyway hi 

444.08 445.38 A: (( oh yeah )) 

445.88 446.75 B: (( [noise] )) 

446.57 454.29 A: and um we should do our thing the way i lost the weight was just um drinking you know exercising and drinking diet soda instead of regular soda you know what i'm saying 'cause 

453.91 454.58 B: yeah 

454.74 463.77 A: i like soda and and diet soda is you know doesn't taste half bad but that's you know and exercising regularly and just only eating when i'm hungry that's how i lost it that's why that's the best [noise] 

463.64 471.77 A: i can recommend but somebody once told me that everybody had a different body type uh you know what i mean not everybody loses weight at the same amount of time 

467.35 467.99 B: [noise] 

471.83 473.52 B: right 

472.77 484.43 A: you know what i mean so you know 'cause somebody uh a friend of mine's trying to lose the weight the way i did and it didn't work for him well at least it did it didn't work as fast i lost seventy five pounds in three months and he lost um i don't know how long he's still losing it to this day 

484.57 486.91 A: (( so i guess you know it works differently for people )) 

484.87 485.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

487.22 489.74 B: i i used to know this guy that um 

490.22 491.99 B: (( he was supposed to be on a diet )) 

491.97 492.83 A: (( uh )) 

491.99 498.46 B: and i come to visit him like he's like grabbing a you know a big bag of chips i'm standing there like um [noise] 

498.32 509.84 B: that's not exactly losing weight very well now is it [noise] and and as it turns out [noise] well actually it is cutting down for him he's only having one bag of chips per week instead of ten 

500.81 501.95 A: [laughter] 

509.82 510.75 A: uh 

511.47 522.57 B: [noise] so i guess that is cutting down that that is a significant cut [laughter] uh diet i like i like diet coke 'cause i just kind of grew up with it 

516.19 517.06 A: uh-huh 

522.60 523.39 A: yeah

526.24 529.97 A: yeah it is a you know it lacks that certain thing that coke regular coke has 

531.60 535.18 A: but um i notice that i notice that um you know 

535.59 536.33 A: (( people )) 

536.86 542.58 A: (( um you know is is is you know people lose weight differently i )) 

543.30 547.58 A: think that when you diet and you've got to really stick to it you've got to have a mind set 

548.22 549.15 B: [noise] 

548.31 552.37 A: 'cause you can't you can't just you can't just look at yourself say i'm fat and i've got to lose weight 

550.83 553.03 B: (( yeah )) 

552.39 556.97 A: and not be committed to it because if you're not committed to it you really don't want to or you're really not committed to it 

555.24 557.06 B: absolutely 

557.16 561.55 A: (( that's when you start messing up and you start cheating a little bit )) 

559.32 560.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

561.36 575.46 B: uh supposedly the whole thing is oh the first step is to admit that you're plump that's a load of crap the first step is not to admit that you're plump the first step is to say i have a problem what can i do about it [noise] that's the first step 

565.93 567.33 A: yeah yeah 

572.47 573.42 A: yeah 

575.35 579.97 A: (( i mean some people want to lose weight but they don't want to lose it so badly they want to cut out the food they like you know what i mean )) 

579.51 580.55 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

580.65 587.28 A: they just want they just want to lose weight and they want to lose the easiest fastest way possible and there's no such way except for you know surgery but even that's 

585.63 587.77 B: yeah [noise] 

587.94 590.09 A: time and money you know what i'm saying so
