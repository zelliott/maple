16.01 17.00 A: (( so [sigh] )) 

17.07 22.50 A: uh so i guess the topic is how it changed your life since september eleven huh 

21.95 24.00 B: (( uh that sounds pretty good yeah )) 

23.51 24.48 A: [laughter] 

24.54 25.52 A: (( um )) 

25.88 29.33 A: i'm just trying to think about that i don't know that i have actually 

29.95 36.23 A: uh y- you know you think about things more now you're a little bit more aware but as far as actual 

36.28 40.40 A: practices in my life i don't know that i've changed anything how about you 

40.44 45.26 B: um well it's really weird uh my wife and i were uh in hawaii 

45.46 50.48 B: um on our wedding slash honeymoon when september eleven happened 

49.92 51.70 A: yeah 

50.62 55.23 B: and uh so we weren't even sure if we were gonna get home but um 

55.03 57.21 A: oh yeah 

55.95 61.57 B: i suppose that uh the biggest thing i mean we think about now i know we talked about 

61.86 71.28 B: we were gonna travel to new york last year uh as part of a vacation and uh that was around the time when all the things were happening over in the middle east and so 

70.64 73.04 A: oh okay yeah 

71.55 79.01 B: we uh we cancelled the trip and decided to go some place else because of it and i think we're a lot more aware travel wise now 

79.21 82.90 B: uh where we go and kinda what we're doing uh 

79.80 82.27 A: yeah i can understand 

83.13 89.67 B: than we were before september eleventh and i think that's probably the biggest change in our life 'cause we travel quite a bit so sure 

89.81 97.27 A: oh yeah well i if i did travel i definitely would stop and think about things like that i'm not a big traveller and my wife 

97.39 100.60 A: where she works she did travel as a matter of fact uh 

100.62 111.00 A: she was in canada at the time and she got to they couldn't they wouldn't let her return for another day there come across the border 'cause they closed all the borders 

111.72 112.69 A: so 

113.32 119.29 A: uh [mn] with her traveling uh she she kind of uh cut back on international travel 

119.44 120.55 A: but uh 

121.15 126.57 A: myself uh i'm pretty much a my job is local i don't do much flying 

127.18 128.03 A: uh 

128.68 129.70 A: are you still there 

129.55 131.58 B: yeah oh yeah yep 

130.08 132.90 A: oh okay it's just really quiet i couldn't tell 

132.73 133.53 B: no 

133.90 137.30 A: but i work for a a freight company a cargo company 

136.93 137.81 B: uh-huh 

137.35 139.60 A: and we used to be able to uh 

139.83 147.50 A: fly in the cockpit across country wherever we wanted to go we could yeah it was really nice but uh they have cut that out now 

143.08 144.12 B: oh wow 

147.78 151.60 A: uh if you're not a crew member now you can't ride in the cockpit [noise] any longer 

151.59 166.43 B: [mn] yeah that i i think um that's um i was a police officer for six years i go to nursing school now but um i was a police officer for six years and right after september eleventh and stuff i did notice quite a few changes that they were making 

159.77 160.80 A: oh okay 

166.27 168.93 A: security wise yeah 

166.42 167.25 B: uh 

167.64 172.12 B: in the intelligence community and things and information being a lot of tighter 

172.25 177.45 B: um and that sort of stuff and you know i think you just kinda watch people more i mean i've noticed when 

177.56 185.58 B: uh i've been out at the [mn] like the airport or different places i think you just gotta keep a closer eye on things 

183.83 185.91 A: you keep your eyes open now huh 

186.61 191.57 B: now yeah and really i've been aware of the increased security around stuff we went to uh 

191.63 195.21 B: st louis on vacation last spring break and uh 

195.29 202.44 B: visited the national arch down there and uh the security was a lot tighter than what i thought it would be so 

198.02 199.74 A: yeah 

202.48 208.60 B: um it's kinda nice though i i kinda like it because it does make you feel more secure i think at least 

208.83 214.86 A: i think it does i think it makes uh the general public feel a little more secure now they can see 

215.59 216.53 A: uh 

216.81 219.73 A: well they see law enforcement i 

220.28 224.78 A: guess it's just more obvious now that they're out there they're out and about 

224.80 226.48 A: the physical presence 

226.83 228.74 A: [mn] where it wasn't before 

228.91 230.84 B: yeah and i i uh 

231.25 235.64 B: i think too i think we as americans kinda take 

235.67 238.13 B: security for granted you know what i mean 

238.33 241.27 A: yeah and my eyes have definitely opened to that 

240.62 241.94 B: yeah me too 

241.67 242.52 A: uh 

242.66 255.04 A: as i look around you know i just read i read books on uh iraq and iran and the middle east since that so i guess maybe in a way [laughter] my life has changed i don't think about it because now i'm more aware of uh 

254.99 257.96 A: the other cultures the lives they live 

258.04 261.62 A: uh how they're so different from what we 

262.40 264.71 A: wh- wh- what we can even conceive 

264.65 270.55 B: yeah though i mean it's pretty weird how the world that you're raised in kinda dictates a lot of that 

264.77 265.72 A: (( you know )) 

270.10 272.48 A: yeah yeah it absolutely does 

272.73 276.48 B: but i was watching uh something on t._v. here a while back that talked about 

276.91 287.60 B: the radical you know muslim extremist sort of belief that basically they're people taught since birth you know that the united states is evil and that we're all you know 

287.63 292.46 B: a bunch of people who's wanting to eliminate islam and all this other stuff man 

290.32 292.73 A: yeah yeah 

292.63 293.99 B: a lot of hatred 

293.75 304.33 A: yeah because prior to that you would stop and think prior to september eleven you know other nobody can have that much hate inside them for for somebody they don't even know 

303.70 306.70 B: th- that's right a culture they don't even really know 

304.60 317.24 A: never even met yeah but but they do and [sigh] they're just and i guess it's just ingrained in them as children and everything as they come up and it's just uh 

315.56 316.91 B: and that uh 

317.22 321.67 A: y- you know i guess after september eleven you finally started to realize 

321.89 324.35 A: hey yeah they really do hate us that much 

324.83 331.30 B: yeah and that's the thing i mean i'm sure you know it's just gonna be a matter of time before another attack happens i 

330.92 333.22 A: yeah i i think you're right there 

333.23 338.58 B: don't think there's anything they're gonna do to to ever prevent one from happening again 

333.25 334.33 A: and it uh 

338.36 343.89 A: no they may delay it uh they may alter it a little bit but i think you're right it's eventually gonna happen 

344.22 351.42 A: it's just uh it's just scary the different things you think about now that in a in a way 

351.46 353.64 A: you know you don't like to see it but uh 

353.98 356.83 A: the media throws all this stuff out there 

356.10 358.69 B: ((  )) 

356.88 360.43 A: and i'm af- afraid it's giving 'em ideas 

359.77 364.03 B: yeah that's just what i was getting read to say too every time you know 

364.04 376.77 B: well right after september eleventh they started talking about how you know terrorists might fly planes into nuclear power centers and all this other stuff and it's like yeah you're giving 'em ideas you know 

372.34 373.76 A: yeah 

375.68 377.01 A: no kidding 

377.07 379.00 A: an- and 

378.10 385.95 B: there's a nuclear power plant not too far from omaha in our parts around here where we live and um 

385.81 394.76 B: i tell you what it's you know a pretty interesting concern because really you drive by the place and it doesn't seem all that well guarded what would stop somebody from that 

394.84 400.28 A: sure i mean and and it wouldn't even take a big airline for something like that 

398.35 399.22 B: no 

399.66 403.92 B: no you sure wouldn't think so so or you know the water supply or 

403.33 407.52 A: yeah well then see the media was bringing that up too water supply and stuff 

407.07 413.61 B: any of that stuff i don't think the media helps us a whole lot in a lot of respects that they end up doing right 

413.84 416.50 A: yeah it it's kinda scary and then uh 

416.72 429.18 A: talking about all the the dirty bombs that got out of russia and stuff like that and uh you know [laughter] i really believe those are probably in middle easterners hands some- somewhere 

419.76 420.73 B: uh-huh 

428.57 432.98 B: oh well if they're not they're gonna be you know uh any of those 

431.82 433.21 A: yeah because 

433.12 435.02 B: little countries over there 

434.71 439.19 A: you think of all the things they don't have the one thing they do have is money 

438.02 450.12 B: yeah oh yeah and o- and oil yeah that's exactly it i'm sure you know whatever they've got going on over there now this whole uh war with iraq think is just gonna make 'em madder and 

439.89 440.77 A: so 

449.91 458.03 A: yeah it's just uh stirring up the hornet's nest but uh i don't it it as far as that goes i don't think we have anything to lose 

457.73 461.34 B: keep the well i'm not the you know i i i 

461.41 466.16 B: i think it kinda needed to be done but uh boy i sure did hate it it seems like everyday 

464.89 469.81 A: yeah i this one i really felt uneasy about [noise] i didn't like it all 

468.02 468.78 B: (( no )) 

469.52 474.78 B: every day you know i turn on the news and there's another american or two getting killed over there 

473.63 474.88 A: yeah 

475.55 478.06 A: yeah i know it was kind of a 

478.47 488.57 A: it just kinda lured you in right after the initial phase of it and they took over the country so easily but now you see it's really not that easy and it's not really taking over 

488.30 490.15 B: (( it's gonna take years )) 

490.50 492.54 A: 'cause you see so many more people 

492.88 497.41 A: well i i understand now that they've lost as many as they did in the uh 

498.01 502.96 A: what was it desert storm gulf war yeah yeah 

499.06 500.72 B: gulf war yeah 

501.47 508.95 B: yeah and the resistance seems to be building too i mean it seems like every day there's more and more attacks and 

508.57 511.01 A: yeah it's just getting worse and worse 

509.02 512.13 B: you know more people getting injured uh so 

513.17 516.79 A: i wish they could come up with hussein one way or the other 

516.00 519.12 B: well him and bin laden both 

519.31 521.96 A: yeah now that would be a really big one there 

521.37 533.97 B: you know you think of i i just think in sheer money wise you know how much money we spent on all this stuff it's in the hundreds of billions of dollars and we can't even get these two people 

534.43 541.20 A: yeah that's amazing you think when you think of america and their might and their power and stuff 

541.66 544.01 A: i don't it only goes so far 

543.61 546.87 B: well yeah you know how big is the world to hide in 

546.54 551.02 A: yeah yeah and especially when you've got people that'll hide you 

548.43 549.06 B: (( uh )) 

550.98 554.52 B: a big world right and that kinda money too 

551.47 554.18 A: and you know uh it really 

554.58 559.37 A: really the one thing that's on their side is 

559.45 562.19 A: their ability to stay away from technology 

562.69 563.51 B: yeah 

562.69 569.18 A: so that uh you can't track 'em through communications and computers and stuff like that at 

569.21 570.34 A: least 

569.21 574.80 B: well and too you know they can survive out in the middle of nowhere with little or next to nothing you know 

575.42 577.04 A: yeah 

575.45 580.83 B: not like people uh who are used to having electricity and all these other things 

581.35 582.71 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

581.94 586.55 B: i think they'd probably be pretty comfortable in a cave sort of thing if that's the way you're used to living 

587.45 597.02 A: oh yeah they- they've lived there for years and yeah and you think [mn] the way americans think is like us they've got millions and millions of dollars what'd they wanna live in a cave for [laughter] 

595.57 597.69 B: well that's exactly right 

597.08 598.44 A: yeah 

597.75 599.90 B: um or you know just what they
