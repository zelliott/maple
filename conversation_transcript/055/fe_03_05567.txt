32.90 39.18 B: well i'm retired military and uh i was very much concerned about uh 

34.76 35.75 A: mhm 

39.37 53.84 B: [mn] this happening to o- our country and uh i [mn] decided what could i do 'cause i'm i'm uh eighty years old and and i it's hard to figure anything else i could do so i've i've i've uh 

54.01 57.99 B: uh i'm i i'm i'm more appreciative of what i have 

58.21 62.00 B: and and i'm concerned about what we we are losing 

62.87 66.14 A: uh concerned about what we are losing uh i- in what way 

66.12 70.28 B: [noise] well i mean from i think that the media has uh 

70.31 72.15 B: uh got into uh 

72.38 86.09 B: every time any little bit of news comes out they e- exploit it and i i think they get everybody excited about it and i think they condemn our president and they condemn the people who are trying hard and uh 

85.90 93.07 B: uh it's strictly a political situation as far as i can see instead of having patriots anymore we have politicians 

94.81 99.05 A: i i i'm sorry i m- i missed the last part instead of having what 

98.47 102.56 B: instead of being a patriot we have politicians now 

100.26 101.37 A: (( oh i see )) 

102.36 103.73 A: (( [lipsmack] i see )) 

102.78 107.69 B: they're they're more interested in in politics than they are in in serving their country 

107.86 111.71 A: i see now now you you say that applies to the news media 

112.60 122.83 B: well i- it ap- it applies to the the the the the news on t._v. and and yeah the news media and uh both written and and uh visual you know 

122.43 129.22 A: right right because you see i i've i've seen it in in a very very similar way 

126.84 127.87 B: [noise] 

129.33 134.42 A: uh the problem is w- w- i i agree that that that's how the news media reacts 

134.36 145.33 A: in some ways but as far as i've seen it politicians do also react that way there are a lot of politicians out there who are not interested in 

145.59 151.44 A: patriotism as much as they are interested in making things better for themselves mhm 

148.38 149.44 B: right 

150.38 158.37 B: right the- they're they're actually what w- what i think uh what i think really happened is that instead of trying to do good and to help people 

158.33 164.90 B: uh if it's not in their political if the person is not in their political uh uh party 

164.80 170.18 B: then they condemn whoever is there no matter what they're doing and i've seen occasions where 

169.98 172.74 B: a person who is definitely right in 

172.51 186.97 B: in what they were saying and what they were doing and having certain politicians come up and for the hope of of uh dumping the present uh people or getting in themselves they make comments that are unfavorable 

186.73 190.56 B: and i- it it's i- a lot of them have been proved not to be true 

190.67 195.33 B: and it it's it's a shame you know i think that this country means an awful lot to me 

195.35 196.84 B: and i 

196.87 199.51 B: [lipsmack] have one one little thing in my mind that 

199.58 203.05 B: i i try each day to do one thing good for somebody 

202.62 204.01 A: (( mhm mhm [lipsmack] )) 

203.09 212.23 B: and whether they're black or white or green or yellow i like to go up and talk to them and do something and make them feel hey this is a good country if you don't like it get out you know 

212.50 214.38 B: that's the way i think i feel 

214.23 218.76 A: oh yeah oh i i agree totally see the thing is i 

219.08 221.81 A: [lipsmack] live in new york my

229.06 230.98 B: right 

230.21 238.66 A: uh he's fine you know he's he's all right but you know for a while we had no idea what had happened to him and my my brother 

236.00 237.02 B: yeah that's 

238.96 247.73 A: is a construction worker who is part of the unbuilding of the world trade center so for us 

241.70 242.36 B: (( [noise] )) 

248.01 258.95 A: uh i i mean i- in my family it it it hit us certainly not as strongly as someone who lost somebody but pretty strongly my father 

258.91 264.29 A: was one of the original engineers who put up the world trade center 

263.80 265.14 B: oh good 

264.53 275.47 A: and and now my brother is one of the engineers who's digging it out so you know it's it's such a a a cycle almost in in my family mhm 

274.93 283.49 B: well i think in my lifetime i've had i've had the pleasure of serving uh twenty years in the navy and i was in naval intelligence 

283.52 291.08 B: and served uh as uh served in in egypt uh e- egypt and uh my the first uh 

291.41 295.93 B: central intelligence authority sidney w. souers was my boss 

295.92 297.05 A: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

296.41 298.64 B: and when he got into washington 

298.84 303.47 B: uh he i i i worked with him down in p- por- in puerto rico san juan 

303.14 304.27 A: right

308.87 310.10 A: huh

322.35 325.39 B: and or i got orders i mean to go to washington 

325.08 326.27 A: mhm 

325.73 334.46 B: so i went i went to naval intelligence foreign service school and got an assignment as the chief clerk at the at the naval on in egypt 

334.54 340.78 B: so i've had a lot to be grateful for and i have seen people the way people live in egypt i've seen the way 

340.76 352.59 B: uh i've been through all of those countries and i see what it is and i'm i'm provoked when uh uh people just because they're they're they're not uh republican or they're not democrat 

352.67 357.64 B: uh they have a scan against whatever anybody's trying to do 

357.40 358.27 A: (( mm )) 

357.86 371.62 B: and and i thi- i think that same thing on the world trade center well that was the hot thing for a while but as as soon they soon forgot it they they forgot they wanted to blame somebody else for something else or something else came up that they would discuss you know 

371.33 372.61 A: right 

372.29 374.39 B: after i retired from the navy 

375.08 378.72 B: i went to work with scripts uh which was a newspaper 

377.99 379.50 A: sure sure yes 

379.45 383.77 B: [cough] and al- also television and i worked for them for twenty three years 

383.78 397.92 B: and i i i i mean i've seen a lot of things that happened you know and what people do and of course it's important it's your job that you get a good story and uh they if they don't have one they make one up you know 

397.95 402.54 B: uh i- it it's [laughter] it's it's it's a shame but they'll pick up the 

400.99 402.96 A: it's unfortunate yes 

402.63 405.63 B: [cough] they'll pick up if if there's a demonstration [cough] 

406.03 410.44 B: down in in cincinnati in times square i got a little cough here [cough]

412.73 414.98 B: well i'm on oxygen and i have uh 

414.91 428.57 B: uh c._o._p._d. so i'm d- working my head off here and i'm feeling good i have no complaints i think this is a beautiful country i love it i'd i want to i get a a s- a chance to participate in a survey like this 

418.88 419.72 A: oh 

428.55 435.82 B: i welcome the chance because that's the only way you're going to get ahead and i think that i have i have i have friends that i 

431.79 432.75 A: mhm 

435.68 443.15 B: argue with uh very religiously about why the hell don't you get out and vote you have no right to complain 

442.99 450.71 B: unless you go and vote unless you you vote selectively knowing who the hell you're voting don't vote for a party vote for a good man 

449.21 454.62 A: exactly if if you don't vote i don't want to hear your complaints 

454.08 458.90 B: exactly and if you don't like our country get the hell out and go back where you came from [noise] 

454.87 456.21 A: because because 

458.67 467.17 A: i mean wo- once you vote then you know you're free to say well my guy didn't get in and the other guy is a bum and and you could do that 

466.55 468.60 B: (( exactly exactly )) 

467.43 471.51 A: but if you don't vote ye- ye- ye- you lose that right 

470.78 472.65 B: exactly that's true 

472.39 474.61 A: that's that makes perfect sense 

474.02 484.81 B: i i think you with this situation over in the middle east and having been over there and seeing how those people react and uh i whe- when they talk about the weapons of m- of uh 

484.70 496.24 B: uh mass destruction and stuff like that certainly they had a unit and maybe they're hidden so well we can't find them right now but i know damn well in my heart i feel that they're there 

496.44 501.20 B: i feel that they're there and i feel that you know it's a a 

501.42 505.45 B: but that story goes right out in window in five minutes 

505.30 518.92 B: as soon as somebody rapes somebody or somebody kills their wife or something like that then that becomes the big story and i listen to quite a lot of news i listen to c._n._n. news and i listen to la- larry king i like larry king about the best of all of them 

518.63 519.33 A: (( mm )) 

518.93 521.72 B: because i think he ge- he's fair you know 

521.79 529.15 B: and he he'll he'll give a thorough thing and he doesn't try to be political i don't think he or at least i didn't f- i didn't never felt that he did you know 

528.17 530.32 A: (( hm [noise] right right [lipsmack] )) 

529.63 531.33 B: but it it's a
