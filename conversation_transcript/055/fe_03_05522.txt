0.00 1.04 B: joel [noise] 

2.32 3.53 A: steve 

7.02 9.94 B: [noise] so i guess the conversation's started 

9.73 11.54 A: i guess so how you doing 

10.41 13.31 B: [laughter] all right so this 

12.32 14.34 A: have you done these before or 

14.13 17.69 B: is the first time i uh i'm doing this this 

16.82 19.21 A: yeah same here same here [laughter] 

19.14 24.10 B: so uh i guess we have to talk or discuss uh the topic which is uh physical 

24.11 26.26 B: fitness and exercise [mn] 

25.58 29.97 A: [noise] right exactly so do you uh uh 

30.41 35.87 A: what's your your level of activity you know like on a you know given day or given week 

34.93 39.52 B: [noise] well i i work out about four to five times per week 

39.45 40.42 A: okay 

40.07 41.52 B: um 

41.56 46.25 B: i think it's um very important because for me number one it helps um 

46.69 53.02 B: to reduce my stress level and also to uh have some sort of control over my weight 

53.39 55.83 B: um [noise] i think it 

54.85 62.00 A: right the same for same for me exactly uh i don't know what your age you know 'cause i'm uh forty six years old but uh 

61.98 75.49 A: you know it's it's harder for me to you know maintain my weight uh i mean it's not as easy as when i was like twenty you know six years old and [noise] uh i find by uh you know watching what i eat uh 

75.81 77.51 A: as well as like you know 

77.69 84.64 A: uh activity as uh such as like for instance i ride my bike about uh uh three to four uh 

84.83 87.35 A: days a week maybe about uh 

87.40 89.32 A: ten twelve miles 

89.31 90.46 B: (( [noise] oh yeah )) 

89.46 93.13 A: uh as well as i do quite a bit of walking and 

92.06 96.45 B: so would you would you conder- consider yourself like in good physical shape or 

96.99 101.41 A: i would say uh better tha- i i would say better than the average okay 

98.35 99.73 B: or you still have to 

101.15 102.82 B: better than average okay 

101.45 102.20 A: (( so )) 

102.87 103.87 A: how about you 

103.58 108.40 B: um uh i think it's a matter of perspective some people think that i'm uh 

108.42 114.67 B: i'm pretty big because uh the main focus of my uh fitness is uh weight training 

114.80 118.96 B: so um sometimes people confuse mass with um 

118.76 123.35 A: okay in other words you've got body mass but it's uh but it's muscle 

118.97 120.10 B: i guess 

121.83 130.18 B: yeah yeah so when when you look at it from if i'm wearing regular clothes you s- a lot of people might think uh this guys a little 

130.37 137.44 B: [noise] [mn] they they realize that i'm big but they're not aware that it's mostly um muscle mass i do have some fat which i'm still 

137.35 146.10 B: working on but um it's not proportionately to the amount of muscle that i have it's it's not that it's insignificant but it doesn't uh 

146.21 149.07 B: show as much and i think it has 

148.25 148.96 A: (( sure )) 

149.30 151.09 B: i'm sorry [noise] um i 

150.37 153.08 A: no i understand i understand exactly what you're saying 

152.94 154.78 B: so uh but 

154.78 162.93 B: um but it helps uh i i haven't gone up or down in weight [noise] it's it's been kind of it's funny because 

162.83 175.98 B: you gain muscle mass and you lose fat but you're weight doesn't really change so you exchange one for the other and it can be it could be deceiving do you um do you take any supplements in addition to your your regular diet or 

168.08 170.08 A: for the other right sure 

176.15 183.01 A: no no no i mean i take you know like a daily you know uh vitamin like uh i take centrum but uh 

177.50 178.32 B: no 

183.10 188.79 A: uh other than that that's about it and you know it's like it's like the last year i've been uh 

189.01 195.24 A: like juicing in other words uh like on a daily basis like uh i do like 

195.38 206.76 A: carrots uh i juice carrots celery you know various you know green vegetables even though it might taste crappy but i it's i understand uh you know it's really good for you 

206.66 219.98 B: [noise] yeah i'd stick to v8 i know that i do a very poor job at eating vegetables though what i do to compensate for that is i drink v8 um [noise] [mn] and i also take um fibre supplements 

220.03 224.13 B: and and i also try to reduce the amount of red meat that i 

220.08 221.21 A: (( okay i see )) 

224.14 226.74 B: that i eat because i i i'm conscious that 

226.75 231.05 B: i really lack in the area of um of you know vegetables 

231.11 235.36 B: [noise] so so that's what happens when you were raised on meat for your whole 

231.20 232.10 A: uh-huh 

235.44 236.75 A: [laughter] 

235.78 245.41 B: [noise] for for your entire life i'm thirty three by the way um but i will tell you this my metabolism uh it's been very hard to keep up with it because 

238.83 239.72 A: okay 

245.34 258.07 B: obviously when when i was a teenager i used to play tennis a lot and i was very fit and and after i passed the age of about twenty four twenty five i noticed that [mn] i needed to 

258.04 269.65 B: [noise] you know do an extra effort to just maintain the same level that i had a few years prior to that so now that i'm thirty three it's even worse because i haven't really changed my eating habits 

262.84 263.75 A: right 

269.49 278.31 B: but i noticed that any little variation like if i i mess up with my meat intake protein intake i tend to gain weight easily 

278.34 283.28 B: so you know it's it gets frustrating sometimes but 

281.82 285.52 A: see i've i've i've become more cognizant of like uh 

285.91 288.66 A: (( uh say like for instance i uh )) 

288.92 297.43 A: (( you know i i mean i like butter i mean i could put butter on any- but you know and uh yeah and i just )) 

291.89 294.70 B: oh i love butter [laughter] 

297.51 307.86 A: it's just a rare occasion that i even use butter you know i mean if my wife cooks with it that's one thing but i mean i could yeah i could eat like a whole loaf of italian bread with butter i mean i 

300.08 301.23 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

306.55 308.70 B: oh me too [laughter] 

307.88 317.59 A: you know so i you know uh i kind of really watch my fat so i've never been a real sweet or so like ice cream and that kind of thing 

317.10 317.86 B: (( mm )) 

317.60 321.79 A: is not a you know issue with me but uh 

322.01 323.44 A: (( um )) 

323.51 328.33 A: yeah i tend to like like you know salty uh 

326.98 328.39 B: your rich tastes 

329.16 330.18 A: what's that 

329.21 343.12 B: that that's how i describe it really something that's rich in taste and flavor uh butter is ri- i love like just like you italian bread with butter i like things that are buttery in general like if i have vegetable i make it i try to have butter on it to 

332.95 334.48 A: yeah right 

342.74 344.68 A: oh yeah exactly 

343.19 347.86 B: e- even my rice when i was kid i used to always like that kind of stuff on it 

347.87 358.94 B: um but i notice that i don't know if it's something that has to do with again with the metabolism but lately it's like my body has not been able to really uh handle things that are 

359.49 369.63 B: [noise] that are from milk like um that have lactose and that includes butter or cheese and milk itself so i've been switching to protein substitutes 

368.52 369.43 A: uh-huh 

369.75 370.75 B: um 

370.54 385.41 B: but hey i i think i share the same flavor and funny enough is that these are all acqui- acquired tastes these are things that you've i have been used to ever since i was a kid so [laughter] so people don't understand how come you put so much butter it's like well ever since i was a kid that's how 

378.76 379.80 A: yeah [laughter] 

385.27 387.60 B: (( my parents fed me so )) 

388.11 389.00 B: um 

388.23 393.27 A: were uh either of your parents or siblings uh like overweight or 

392.77 397.86 B: no my mo- my father is he's not really in shape he's not but 

397.83 405.08 B: he's more the type where you see like the rest of his body is looks okay but it's just the belly area that just like drops 

405.00 419.53 B: and then you go back to the legs it's small again and so on and i don't know if it's genetic because um it seems like most people in on my father's side of the family that gain weight seem to gain weight like that only in the abdominal area 

405.18 406.30 A: (( uh okay )) 

418.97 421.26 A: abdominal area i see yeah 

419.79 423.24 B: a- but they're not they're they're not they've they've never been really 

423.52 436.15 B: active it's not not like me i've made it a point throughout my life to to be um to use a part of a gym or and be get involved in some sports activity it doesn't seem like it was in parents' culture to 

436.22 438.13 B: to get involved [noise] 

437.81 439.33 A: i see yeah 

438.41 446.00 B: on a regular it seemed more like it was a phase in their life either when they were teenagers they played soccer or something like that my mother however is good at uh 

446.07 450.59 B: [noise] keeping in shape so and we don't have a choice because we have a history of uh 

450.74 453.03 B: of heart disease in my family so 

452.57 453.43 A: uh-huh 

453.25 454.89 B: so i have to be careful 

454.72 468.63 B: so far so good cholesterol is low weight is not exactly where i would want it if i could lose an extra seven pounds i'd be very happy with that but overall body contour it's it's not it's it's it's decent it's nice to look at 

468.28 469.87 A: (( [laughter] that's good )) 

468.73 469.85 B: and so 

469.94 479.24 B: you know by the time i reach your age i i hope to have uh maintained at least your level i hope that i won't have i i i wouldn't have slowed down by then so 

479.92 484.18 A: i mean i don't you know i i don't feel i you know like when i hit the uh 

484.60 489.37 A: uh age of like forty i said jeeze this is like the end of the world but uh you know 

489.99 495.73 A: you're as old as you feel i mean i don't feel nor- i mean most people don't take uh me for being 

496.01 509.69 A: forty six they think i'm in my late thirties uh 'course people are just being kind too but uh but i feel that way too you know i don't uh [noise] feel i look my age or act my age uh 

502.02 502.99 B: (( [sigh] mm )) 

509.71 523.97 A: you know at all and i mean and and a good part of that is because i do you know uh you know i care about what the way i look you know it's like you know if uh clothes start feeling tight and your like pants start feeling tight and it makes you little uncomfortable you know 

521.90 524.98 B: mhm mhm 

524.12 532.04 A: uh you know and it's you know i guess a lot of it has to do with self esteem and uh you know i like to look good you know 

531.96 546.89 B: yeah me too it's like i you feel i think it and it's it's a psychological thing also it it boosts it boosts your overall your image if you're f- if you feel confident and you like the way you look it shows in your attitude and [mn] the way you carry yourself 

544.83 545.93 A: (( exactly )) 

546.33 547.62 A: exactly 

547.14 551.43 B: so it's not it's not a question of being like full of it but 

551.27 565.24 B: on the other hand you when you're up there mentally and you're confident about yourself you have a more positive attitude also with everything else that you do especially [noise] work or or any other area in your life so 

564.40 565.59 A: right right 

565.55 574.34 B: [noise] it's not just the physical it's also a mental thing and for me like i said it's stress it's a stress reducer exercising i just take all my frustrations out on the treadmill 

574.24 581.01 B: i feel relaxed and too tired to be bothered with problems afterward [laughter] so 

578.34 579.45 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

581.35 585.46 B: um gee what area we have we not covered yet 

585.26 591.37 A: i don't know i don't know it's just doing it for the first how did you get involved in doing this uh 

585.59 588.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

590.28 594.77 B: uh i i i went to a a a website called craig list 

594.86 599.94 B: and 'cause sometimes um you know if i can find something where you can do a little extra money on the 

594.92 595.93 A: yeah
