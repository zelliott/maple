18.84 28.01 A: uh not really my job is uh i work outside so i think uh i know it's not enough exercise but i know you know i'm not doing nothing all day so 

19.45 20.20 B: (( [cough] )) 

28.06 29.19 A: how 'bout you 

28.83 40.94 B: um yeah i do um i work out like four to five times per week so um er what kind of what kind of work do you do that involves you physically 

40.34 47.85 A: uh well i i do uh painting and monarch construction and stuff like that i i work with a a guy who uh you know who 

47.72 62.11 A: does contracts so i help him out and so i'm always outside doing something um but i never i don't know i used to uh go to a gym but then i you know um didn't uh have a membership [laughter] there anymore so and i never renewed it 

51.35 52.30 B: okay 

61.78 62.93 B: (( oh okay )) 

62.65 64.71 A: so what do you do you go to the gym 

64.17 66.29 B: yeah i go to the gym um 

66.38 67.36 B: i 

67.67 75.88 B: i i do an office work so i'm an admin assistant so i sit down most of the day so it's actually refreshing to go 

71.60 72.59 A: (( oh okay )) 

75.95 78.98 B: uh to the gym in the evening or sometime 

77.61 90.53 A: yeah yeah i can see that i went um i used to work [noise] as an intern at a a company and it was you know at the end of the day i had so much energy just 'cause like you know i was sitting around all day that's actually when i used to work out so 

90.61 96.45 B: yeah uh i assume that 'cause of the kind of work that you do [noise] it's probably your mind is 

96.48 109.31 B: um always focused 'cause yours your your kind of work is is more physical whereas you know i find that if you sit down behind a desk in front of a computer it also gives enough time for your mind to wander and think about other problems 

108.86 116.87 A: yeah well it's it's true it it depends on i mean if i'm working by myself i i you know my mind can wander pretty much since i've 

109.36 110.38 B: so 

116.91 126.25 A: i don't know i've done it so much that it's one of those things that i don't even need to pay attention to anymore if i'm um especially if i'm painting painting or something that i've done for a while so 

121.42 123.11 B: yeah 

126.27 131.02 B: and you feel that you're burning a lot of calories doing that i mean does it actually keep you fit 

129.35 143.73 A: no no i know i'm not in very good shape as far as uh you know that goes i mean i've gotten um i don't know yeah i'm in decent shape as far as uh [noise] you know muscles go but not as far as cardio vascular you know uh 

140.57 141.70 B: yeah 

142.87 144.23 B: yeah 

144.00 147.39 A: i need to run or do something like that [noise] 

146.86 158.44 B: yeah 'cause i i know there's a lot of uh contractors construction guys they're usually you could see that they're very very strong but a lot of times i don't know if you know like you said it's not enough cardio or 

153.29 154.30 A: yeah 

158.37 162.46 A: yeah you got a nice little beer gut going um you know yeah 

158.58 159.45 B: uh 

160.67 161.59 B: (( okay )) 

161.97 168.21 B: which is a slight problem that i have it's not really a serious problem i do have a gut but it's also related to my diet 

168.08 179.64 B: i mean although um i i exercise as much as i can but it kind of it kind of defeats the purpose but i i take more calories than i can p- [noise] burn let's just put it that way 

179.25 193.23 A: that's true uh whenever i go to uh go down to work i always pick up fast food is the first thing i eat and then on the way back i eat fast food so it's like you know it's just i'm really just hitting myself eh when it comes to the diet 

192.81 200.21 B: i know and i don't get any help at home either 'cause you know my girlfriend she likes to cook like she loves pasta and that kind of stuff 

199.93 201.70 A: ah yeah yeah 

200.34 207.60 B: so you know pasta a beer here and there and that's it you're done for and during the week when you go to wendy's or 

207.24 208.39 A: [laughter] 

207.79 210.38 B: or a mackey d's and then that's it man 

209.99 212.62 A: yeah you're totally done 

210.44 211.37 B: so 

212.36 218.76 B: so that that's one of the reasons why i have to go to the gym because i gain weight fairly easily right now i consider myself to be in 

219.32 230.21 B: decent shape but i know that it could be much much better uh magazine if i stopped like eating all that that meat that i eat every day 

224.15 225.76 A: yeah yeah 

230.23 240.50 A: yeah it shows you i don't know about that i just like looking at the the magazines where they show the guys with like chiseled figures and whatnot i think that's that's not you know something that 

238.65 243.59 B: [noise] well you know it's not it's not really realistic i mean it 

242.44 244.06 A: yeah yeah 

243.59 246.93 B: it's it's it's good if you want to i guess 

246.87 251.05 B: look at that as a source of inspiration and saying okay i can achieve 

249.72 250.32 A: (( [noise] )) 

250.96 264.07 B: something decent but not n- not like that because not everybody's built the same way and not everybody is uh and not everybody that works out will have the same kind of cuts the same kind of abdominals because 

256.10 257.73 A: yeah exactly 

263.91 267.29 B: we don't have we don't all have the same metabolism 

266.97 267.97 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

267.31 281.12 B: and uh i think gyms capitalize on that a lot they want you to have that image and and they all just keep you on coming because you know in the end you never really do achieve uh that 

279.50 282.81 A: yeah you never get that that perfect figure 'cause 

281.79 284.19 B: exactly unless you're a 

284.23 292.79 B: you're either a professional body builder or someone who's a trainer or in that field in that industry so 

291.36 301.92 A: [noise] yeah and also i mean in s- in the magazines i know they do this on women a lot more than they do it on guys but they also air brush a lot of the pictures yeah and things like that [noise] 

299.02 301.08 B: oh yes they do they do 

301.30 303.91 B: yeah they sure do um 

303.97 309.19 B: i don't know but i i also don't have much of a choice 'cause in my family is a there's a history of um 

309.48 314.53 B: of uh heart disease and stuff like that so on my father's side of the family so 

311.35 321.68 A: [noise] oh yeah yeah actually also there's a there's a big history of heart disease on my family uh it's my side of you know in my family too so 

321.70 326.85 A: [noise] i feel like i should you know i know i'm not exercising enough and you know [lipsmack] 

327.30 334.84 A: it's something that i realize you know every day i should be doing but it's one of those things that's really hard to motivate and you know 

334.71 335.62 B: uh-huh 

335.18 335.95 A: but 

335.79 336.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

336.19 346.25 A: i don't know it i remember when i used to work out it was like the first couple of times you do it [noise] it's really [noise] hard [noise] and then you just get into the [noise] the [noise] you know the groove of it and you're [noise] doing it every day 

346.51 348.08 A: (( [noise] but )) 

346.94 348.97 B: [noise] well yeah well 

349.18 362.39 B: yeah it's not easy to keep uh motivated it's been always one of my problems i've been on and off like one year i'll be totally dedicated and the next year if i stop for a couple of weeks that's it you know and i 

360.17 365.30 A: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah it's er that's the worse thing if you go on vacation or something [noise] 

364.53 366.03 B: oh tell me about it 

365.42 367.86 A: that'll that'll ruin you [laughter] 

366.77 381.68 B: definitely it sure does 'cause that's when i pig out the most like i know in [noise] august i'm gonna be gone for a couple of weeks and just to get back into the groove and you know when you're on vacation you're not thinking about exercise you're just thinking about having fun hm [noise] 

380.33 386.08 A: yeah i went on a uh a cruise with my uh ex girlfriend and my family and stuff and we uh 

386.22 398.30 A: we just ate so much [mn] that like by the time i got back i was like thirty pounds heavier it was awful yeah well not thirty pounds but like fifteen pounds heavier and it was only like a a week two weeks 

391.20 393.41 B: oh my god wow 

398.07 400.61 B: [mn] how old are you if you don't mind me asking 

398.62 399.50 A: (( so )) 

400.61 401.65 A: hm 

400.90 402.17 B: how old are you 

402.06 403.49 A: i'm twenty one now 

402.94 404.59 B: you're twenty one okay 

403.75 405.64 A: (( yeah how old are you [noise] )) 

404.97 406.39 B: i'm thirty three 

406.13 407.62 A: (( oh okay cool )) 

406.70 407.75 B: so 

407.77 412.48 B: uh but no but uh the thing is that as you get older your metabolism slows down you know 

411.78 422.05 A: yeah yeah [noise] and that's just a bad thing for me 'cause i don't know my metabolism's is pretty decent now but with the the amount of crap i eat and the amount of uh 

420.88 431.23 B: yeah it catches up to you believe me it does it did with me i was active when i was a teenager i was like involved in a lot of sports and like in my mid twenties i stopped being 

423.57 424.64 A: yeah 

431.16 440.35 B: uh uh like athletic and forget it and i ever since then i gained a belly that i've been having a hard time getting rid of so [noise] 

438.65 447.65 A: yeah that's the thing and um when i was in high school i used to do so much and then you know when i came to college i don't know just something you know 

447.44 456.83 A: changed or like i was just getting used to college and so i stopped doing as many uh activities and [noise] you know it just spiraled downhill from there [noise] so 

456.03 463.25 B: [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah well you have to be careful if if the the you really have to think about that when you like reach thirty f- thirty five forty 

457.24 458.06 A: uh 

462.90 464.44 A: yeah yeah 

463.35 473.05 B: [noise] 'cause uh i know too many people that you know just kicked the bucket by the time they were fifty five sixty i'm serious and most of them are males on top of that so 

467.59 468.70 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

471.32 472.70 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

473.10 473.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

473.12 482.04 A: yeah no one in my family l- uh lives very long and it's either because of heart disease or because of some alcohol disease so i have two things to watch out for so 

481.08 488.24 B: exactly i can't drink alcohol 'cause apparently i got uh some kidney problems so 

482.13 483.51 A: [laughter] 

487.38 488.66 A: (( [noise] oh yeah )) 

488.25 496.52 B: yeah so on top of that i have additional health concerns and that uh and i used to smoke 'bout a couple of years ago 

492.14 492.86 A: (( mm )) 

495.50 496.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

496.44 510.14 A: yeah i still smoke um that's that's another yeah that's that's really bad for it yeah and i mean it's just one of those things that everyone else on the side does it and [noise] it just keeps reminding me that i could be doing it yeah [noise] [noise] 

498.37 500.24 B: oh that was hard 

501.69 502.90 B: (( oh )) 

507.76 514.17 B: exactly and uh that's why sometimes there's some friends that i hang out less with because 

513.94 525.06 B: you know uh when they're playing cards or dominos or whatever just hanging out they all have a cigarette and they're like you're not gonna smoke man they can't believe that you that that you quit and they like come on just one for good old s- you know 

514.99 515.72 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

524.42 526.64 A: yeah yeah it's like 

525.30 528.30 B: and so instead of helping you [laughter] 

526.99 529.45 A: everyone everyone becomes a 

529.61 541.98 B: exactly because they know that uh they you know er it's not good for you and they don't want to be left out it's like if you gon- if we're going down you're going down with us you better have a smoke [mn] so nah 

530.28 532.45 A: (( [laughter] )) 

539.56 540.93 A: (( exactly )) 

541.13 544.28 A: it's not even something that they do on purpose it's just you know 

543.85 547.12 B: well of course yeah it's a it's a social thing too i mean you know 

546.57 548.10 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

547.36 553.46 B: um but nah i quit my my dad was like a heavy smoker you know he used three packs a day 

548.37 549.26 A: (( [noise] )) 

553.63 559.71 B: and uh wasting all his money in that also and and in [noise] canada cigarettes are really expensive over there 

558.05 560.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] what )) 

559.78 569.44 B: but he had a he my father lives in canada and cigarettes are like just as expensive as here now so you know he'd he'd blow like thirty bucks in one day on on cigarettes 

561.79 563.35 A: [noise] oh okay 

565.69 566.72 A: oh jeeze 

569.17 569.93 A: (( hm )) 

569.64 574.59 B: so uh when he was uh seventy five or so he got a a mild heart attack 

574.62 579.40 B: and you'd think he'd quit he didn't quit he quit for a year and then he went back on it so 

574.95 575.56 A: (( uh )) 

576.50 577.51 A: yeah 

579.54 584.53 B: we're high risk so you know i'm just trying to be careful what really changed me was when um my 

583.69 589.79 A: yeah one of my um one of my friends [noise] or actually one of my family friends got uh lung cancer 

589.33 591.07 B: (( yeah awf- )) 

589.96 596.25 A: and you'd think that would make him want to quit cigarettes he just decided that since he had lung cancer already there was no point in stopping 

595.67 597.89 B: oh boy that's a poor excuse 

596.52 597.46 A: (( oh )) 

597.51 599.89 A: i don't know what kind of logic that is but uh
