70.08 81.78 A: to to mention i guess we both work out and we both we both recognize that that it is healthy but i guess you know that we're not that old yet so that we have to start worrying about you know 

81.51 82.67 B: yeah 

81.84 86.88 A: exercising regularly for the sake of just living longer but i guess 

85.53 90.61 B: yeah well uh a lot of people i guess do that although uh mostly everyone

133.51 137.71 A: if i uh if i run here and there and and work out but 

137.39 142.56 B: well it's definitely you know it it gives you great break from studying and all the crap but 

142.22 150.26 A: yeah exactly exactly yeah that's also [noise] that that's also a thing just to work out to uh take your mind off of uh [noise] other things how old are you

172.80 173.59 A: (( so what's )) 

176.88 181.11 B: i i wonder i wonder how ten minutes could be done with this but uh 

182.18 186.65 A: [noise] yeah another topic i i got before this was like censorship of books so uh 

186.88 188.20 B: (( it's mhm the what [mn] )) 

187.94 189.96 A: censorship of books in schools 

189.62 191.04 B: interesting

193.22 195.12 B: [laughter] yeah yeah 

194.37 204.19 A: don't know i guess that's the work i'm putting on different viewpoints on the line 'cause then there can be the debate [noise] we all seem to agree [noise] you know we're both young we both agree that you know it 

200.62 201.34 B: mm 

203.32 204.90 B: yeah [laughter] 

204.39 206.57 A: is necessary and we'll do it 

205.59 214.25 B: i i believe that they they're doing this more for the linguistic and communicational uh purposes than uh actually the scientific purposes because 

207.32 211.06 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

211.13 212.31 A: yeah that's true 

214.79 225.97 A: yeah that's true but yeah so um working out is good [laughter] [noise] yeah good to put on a a sweat sometimes but uh 

220.20 222.39 B: (( m- yeah [laughter] yeah )) 

226.31 231.61 A: yeah i guess we have to just [noise] wait it out get paid [noise] 

231.47 236.74 B: [noise] yeah uh so no any other sports that you play other than basketball 

234.73 237.79 A: (( [laughter] [noise] um ))

246.93 251.85 A: so um i was obviously pretty much into sports [noise] i love sports but now in college 

252.01 264.02 A: much different you can't really get on the team because they're too good and [noise] [noise] yeah yeah yeah [noise] [noise] much easier you know [noise] 

253.85 254.63 B: (( mhm mm )) 

255.02 256.39 B: (( yeah definitely )) 

256.64 259.18 B: were you on the high school sports teams 

259.95 260.65 B: oh

263.83 267.34 A: yeah so [noise] you know and also college [noise] like much more uh 

267.66 269.49 A: [noise] on time management so 

269.88 279.83 B: yeah time management is always a problem especially you know with uh well no i'm not on any teams now and i i wasn't on any teams in uh high school either but uh

303.96 305.27 A: yeah 

304.83 311.63 B: so working out and uh exercising yeah but actually playing on a professional team is different 

307.94 308.95 A: yeah 

311.47 313.65 A: oh yeah of course that's much worse [noise] 

312.92 317.30 B: because you actually have to spend so much so much time you know every day

318.68 319.56 A: yeah 

319.41 320.86 B: which sucks but

325.34 326.56 A: [noise] 

328.51 333.63 A: yeah yeah and it's i mean i have some friends that are on sports teams and it just becomes uh [lipsmack]

346.91 348.52 B: yeah absolutely 

347.40 355.87 A: it just puts extra pressure on you and [sigh] you know you [noise] you just you don't you start hating it because you have to do it so much [noise] so 

354.88 357.24 B: (( [laughter] yeah mm )) 

356.12 362.29 A: [noise] i mean i'm glad i'm not playing it like on any sport college i wouldn't wanna be but you know intramurals are like club sports 

362.72 364.87 A: you know exer- exercise like that it's uh 

365.43 369.67 A: it's more laid back more fun more you know not as intense
