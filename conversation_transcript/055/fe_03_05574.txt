23.30 27.01 B: not really just watching my back [laughter] 

26.08 37.96 A: well i haven't really either i've noticed a lot of changes going on around me ah changes like government and the military and all i live in a city where there's an air force base 

38.09 49.51 A: and i've noticed a lot of ah a lot more security going on there it's much more difficult to get on the base now if you're a civilian and they're checking i._d.s and everything else 

46.27 47.31 B: (( uh-huh )) 

49.55 58.29 A: and i've noticed a lot of changes going on around me but as far as my own personal life is concerned i haven't made any changes at all 

58.16 70.30 B: yeah that's like me any d- actually i i wish it'd could go back to the old route you know 'cause i like to get on a plane i don't wanna be you know three hours' at a air- you know wanting to get on 

69.49 75.59 A: well i agree with you and i'll admit that i i have not flown since 

75.69 78.20 A: nine eleven i now i haven't 

78.15 90.95 A: um i haven't had a real reason to fly and if i needed to i would probably go ahead and do it anyway but it seems to that a lot of the new security things are just oh 

91.60 94.54 A: it seems they're inconvenient you know what i mean 

93.64 99.30 B: [noise] [noise] yeah 'cause i got strip searched the last time i went to fly and i was like no 

94.67 95.93 A: yeah 

97.60 99.03 A: you're kidding 

99.30 111.76 B: it was out of cleveland ah airport and they were like you know you you look suspicious 'cause i have real long hair and they were like can you follow us ah or i was like sure they thought i was carrying bombs or something and they were like um 

105.00 105.84 A: oh 

111.80 125.18 B: they were looking through my stuff and they were like we need to search you and i was like no problem take your shoes off and i s- took my shoes off and they were like we're gonna strip sh- search you and i was like excuse me they were like yeah i was like well whatever 

125.15 134.77 B: i was just you know but i'll never come back here to um to the airport ever again and the guy says that's your choice and i said when i fly back in i'll go through pittsburgh 

135.18 144.85 A: well i tell you what that that that is to me is unreasonable i mean a strip search just because you they think you look suspicious come on i m- 

136.85 137.41 B: (( [mn] )) 

144.05 146.49 B: i'm american and ah and ah 

145.60 148.23 A: (( well yeah so am i i mean )) 

148.30 152.57 A: i don't look middle eastern or iranian or anything like that 

151.92 157.15 B: [noise] yeah i know and i don't know why they would you know you think they would look for people that's 

157.19 167.85 B: not american you know that's not from or it's out of the united states because i've seen a lot of people or something out of the states and they just let 'em race through the the line and and i 

158.34 159.47 A: yeah 

166.85 169.49 A: well that's ridiculous i mean i 

168.68 177.07 B: that scares me when you're on a plane it's like you know when i'm looking around it's like he could be like carrying a bomb and it's like oh here we go again 

176.38 178.90 A: [laughter] right 

177.46 181.90 B: and then ever since then i'm like i i'm not getting on the plane no way 

180.81 181.54 A: (( uh-huh )) 

182.40 190.62 A: yeah and ah well you know ah since nine eleven i did take a bus um i live in texas where where you live 

190.04 191.14 B: (( [noise] ohio )) 

190.92 196.96 A: ohio i live in texas and i took a bus from my home town to ah dallas 

196.92 208.05 A: and i i noticed ah when when i got on the bus i i there was absolutely no security of any kind whatever i i could've carried an a bomb on the [laughter] and they'd 

207.23 210.89 B: they don't they don't they have no security on buses 

210.30 216.78 A: none whatsoever and i haven't ridden a train but i would imagine it's the same way there 

211.36 212.35 B: none 

216.18 223.23 B: um my understanding they have d- um securities on the train my understanding or or you know like anthrax 

222.94 223.82 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

223.15 230.13 B: before you go to get s- tickets they got security there but when you go to greyhound there's no security just you know 

229.15 230.27 A: really 

229.92 239.61 B: just the guards but that's it but once they don't they don't do nothing with your pack or like you said just put under the bus and that's it there could be a bomb under that bus 

239.25 242.63 A: well let me ask you something ah do you feel 

240.42 241.38 B: go ahead 

242.64 243.82 A: safe 

244.33 245.54 B: yeah 

244.33 250.33 A: flying given what security measures they're taking in airports do you feel safe flying 

250.56 252.18 B: yeah i do right now 

251.49 252.30 A: do you 

252.27 253.26 B: right now 

252.74 261.17 A: well i do too i i i just haven't had an occasion to fly since ah nine eleven but i would feel safe about it 

261.03 264.55 B: i just don't feel safe being in a big city because you know 

264.81 266.15 B: like um 

266.16 275.12 B: one day i was watching t._v. and they said that you know the what um bin laden and saddam hussein or whatever his name said 

273.60 274.31 A: yeah 

274.95 276.30 B: he has 

276.09 282.04 B: coming up for us united states coming up in our near future more bombings 

280.24 281.21 A: yeah 

281.84 295.75 B: i don't feel safe with that because he's pointing out different parts of the country i don't feel safe because it's looking at the the nor- the eastern part of the east coast and it's like i'm on the east coast and this is not cool 

286.22 287.14 A: right 

295.52 296.73 A: (( yeah [laughter] w- )) 

295.62 299.13 B: and it's like i i'm not ready for this 

299.28 302.01 B: it's like this is close to war world three 

301.53 310.69 A: well you know i w- i would be i would be apprehensive or nervous if i went to a like a national landmark like the statue of liberty or 

302.98 303.54 B: (( [cough] )) 

310.59 322.07 A: the golden gate bridge or something like that because i feel that if they're going to target anything it's going to be something that'll be real lose worthy you know like when they hit the world trade center 

311.98 314.04 B: mhm 

319.58 320.67 B: that or 

321.64 328.67 B: yeah that or a nuclear plant and i live fifteen miles from a nuclear plant yup 

323.90 325.37 A: yeah yeah 

326.76 328.36 A: do you now 

328.83 334.47 A: really well i'm nowhere near one myself i live in a small town in texas 

334.47 340.99 A: and there's nothing here that would interest a terrorist at all except we have an air force base here 

340.87 343.53 A: now it's only a training base 

343.22 344.14 B: uh-huh 

343.37 356.00 A: and and and you know ah so i don't think that would even attract too much attention i figure if the ah terrorists are gonna strike they're gonna strike something that's newsworthy like the world trade center you know 

355.35 356.25 B: (( [cough] uh-huh )) 

356.04 361.18 A: and not something in a small town in texas so i feel relatively safe here 

361.32 362.37 B: mhm 

362.91 364.52 B: (( so i don't know )) 

364.69 365.45 A: we 

364.69 367.95 B: i don't i don't know what's gonna happen down the line [noise] 

366.47 376.62 A: yeah and ah if i if i was gonna make a trip to new york and i you know i've never seen the statue of liberty but if i wanted to i would go do it i wouldn't even think about 

376.65 383.11 A: ah terrorists striking ah it it just th- that's not something i walk around worrying about 

382.07 388.45 B: [noise] yeah well ah my theory is you know when your number's up your number's up [noise] 

383.54 384.75 A: yeah 

387.61 391.20 A: well that's true i i kinda feel the same way 

390.68 402.70 B: [noise] so you know i just figure you know when your number's up your number's up and the world trade center went down i figured you know their their numbers were up ah that was that was it [noise] you know 

396.57 397.53 A: yeah 

399.42 400.34 A: yeah 

401.65 411.17 A: well really you know the thing is many many got out of the world trade center before it collapsed and many did not so you know 

405.94 407.69 B: yeah 

408.05 409.34 B: yep 

410.88 411.44 B: (( [cough] )) 

411.42 419.36 A: ah what decided who got out and who didn't it i i think your number's being ah maybe a very good um 

414.69 415.80 B: yep 

419.37 421.10 A: a very good theory 

420.40 427.14 B: [noise] yep and what's w- what's amazing under the world trade center was all them places underneath like um 

427.09 434.06 B: they had ah babysitting or um children's where they could w- your kids could be watched while people were working 

433.59 434.57 A: right 

434.02 444.34 B: they had a donut shop underneath there there was like a little small like little mini mall a train ah or like um um substation 

436.19 437.10 A: uh-huh 

440.53 441.41 A: right 

443.31 446.04 A: yeah a subway yeah uh-huh uh-huh 

444.32 451.15 B: yeah a subway all that stuff under there and all of them people that were underneath there they're the ones that got crushed 

450.84 453.06 A: yeah that's right that's right 

453.01 461.17 B: and i think the ones that got was the ones that was like from i'd say ni- level nine or level ten up was ah was killed from 

460.20 461.18 A: (( uh-huh m- )) 

461.30 470.20 B: from nine down was able to get out 'cause i watched it on the news where people were jumping out i was like oh i would've been one of those who was jumping out 

467.90 468.84 A: yeah 

469.48 472.44 A: ah i i saw that on t._v. that was 

472.05 474.62 B: that was not that that was a 

474.68 479.05 B: that just put cold chills on my in in my body when i seen that 

477.98 490.42 A: you know ah i'm retired now but i used to be a broadcast engineer and there were there were t._v. stations at the very top of one of the world trade center buildings 

490.47 493.82 A: and there were engineers up there 

493.79 505.78 A: to maintain the equipment that was my job for many many years and i i read in ah i'm a member of the society of broadcast engineers and i read in their newsletter that 

506.43 513.05 A: they had engineers up there and after the plane hit you know they were they were talking on the phone to 

513.10 515.84 A: ah their main offices and 

514.38 516.52 B: (( mhm )) 

515.80 525.45 A: and ah the smoke was getting thicker and thicker and one of them said i'm gonna have to put on my oxygen mask now they have the oxygen masks up there 

525.39 533.24 A: and he did and they never heard another word from him so evidently when the the buildings collapsed 

534.03 545.79 A: this is the one with the big tall antenna sticking up on top of it i'm sure you saw it on t._v. and when it all came down i'm sure they died at that point and that kinda puts it close to home to me because 

538.53 540.20 B: mhm yeah 

545.97 551.96 A: i might've been there myself if i had been working in new york 'cause it as a ah broadcast engineer 

551.45 553.35 B: yeah 

552.29 553.50 A: yeah 

553.45 555.32 B: yeah 

555.53 566.96 B: that's just like when they were going to with that airplane they were headed towards washington d._c. to to do something and they ended up in landed in ah somewhere in p._a. and crashing it 

560.01 561.53 A: right 

566.21 567.65 A: right they 

567.79 569.44 B: [cough] they were going 

568.31 574.88 A: ah my understanding is they actually attacked the hijackers and caused the plane to crash yeah 

572.97 577.21 B: yeah but i don't know where they were going in washington d._c. 

576.92 579.38 A: probably toward the white house 

578.76 584.69 B: no i don't i don't think they were headed towards the white house they were headed towards president bush wherever he was 

583.72 594.82 A: well yeah i don't know where he was at the time maybe camp david or something but you know one actually hit the pentagon it didn't do near as much damage a- as it might have but 

587.85 589.30 B: wherever that is 

591.49 593.97 B: that much yeah 

594.21 599.96 B: but it's you know what i went up there about a year ago no not even a year ago it was um last winter
