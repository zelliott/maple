105.95 106.85 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

106.03 111.74 B: and you know i i actually lost a lot of weight 'cause uh er i just wasn't hungry at all 'cause i wasn't moving 

111.95 117.35 B: but after that it was just [laughter] it's hard to get back into it like that though 

116.38 125.81 A: yeah well during during my self imposed rehab [cough] [noise] it was about summer 'cause i got up at my own time like you know around eight o'clock or so 

126.19 129.33 A: and uh 'cause i was home for three months 

128.88 129.81 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

129.66 130.91 A: so i'd um 

131.51 140.26 A: i'd watch a little t._v. have a nice breakfast you know and then i'd uh lift some weights for a while take a shower and by eleven o'clock i was ready to go you know 

139.82 141.29 B: yeah yeah 

140.38 143.20 A: all at my own my own pace 

142.86 146.81 B: yeah well that's uh were were you working or not were you just off work or was it 

146.18 150.28 A: well i was at home for three months rehabbing from my surgery 

149.66 155.10 B: right so you weren't really at your you didn't have to go to work or anything after that so that yeah that that's cool then that's yeah 

152.04 152.85 A: no 

154.68 155.77 A: yep 

155.11 161.44 B: that's see that's the easiest time to to workout is when you have a lot of free time like that 'cause when you only have 

160.13 164.30 A: i felt better and it was uh have a good schedule you know [cough] [cough] 

162.15 163.25 B: (( oh yeah )) 

163.76 164.66 B: yeah 

164.69 168.99 B: and when ya it it it's weird it's like when you uh [cough] 

169.01 177.73 B: when when you do when you lift weights and all y- you just you get more energy i mean not even just lifting weights any kind of exercise at all i i walk i live right next to a uh 

177.78 189.89 B: a a big um park and i walk i guess pretty much the extent of my exercise now is just walking around the park i take two and a half miles now uh and i bought i actually bought you do you workout in your house 

189.55 190.80 A: yeah 

190.23 197.29 B: yeah i bought some weights and i got a bench and i got a curl bar and uh some dumbbells and stuff but i live in a apartment so 

197.43 203.65 B: it's kind of small and uh uh you know i started doing it [noise] i live with one of my friends and he still uses it but 

203.59 216.68 B: i just can't get myself to lift weights in in the living room of my house like it's just i i'm yeah i'm so used to just you know when you're lifting dumbbells and lifting stuff just dropping it on the rubber mats in the gym 

209.69 211.43 A: yeah it just ain't right you know 

216.61 225.87 B: and it feels weird you know i got i got to put [noise] car- i got to put pillows down so i don't go through the floor with the weights when i drop them and uh it's just also 

226.09 240.59 B: it's a mind thing too where you come home at the end of the day and you don't want to er it that that's this is where you come to relax not where you come to workout and uh it was just hard for me do ya did you you worked out at your house you said and [noise] 

239.16 242.60 A: yeah yeah i still do it and a lot of my stuff uh 

242.85 245.14 A: i bought a lot of weights in uh 

245.94 252.60 A: uh my bike i bought but some of the benches that i have [cough] you know i just picked up people were throwing them out you know 

252.44 253.88 B: aye you just took them all 

253.02 256.89 A: yeah there were some really nice ones you know incline benches and different things 

256.48 270.62 B: yeah yeah i got all my stuff the stuff that i bought was all uh from like ki- er there's a store called play it again where it's all secondhand stuff which all works out you know perfectly that er 

257.32 258.52 A: oh yeah 

258.83 259.39 A: (( [cough] )) 

265.81 266.75 A: oh yeah 

270.08 273.19 A: did you buy weights in there how much were they 

271.45 272.85 B: yeah mhm 

273.23 276.71 B: i think they were thirty seven cents a pound something like that 

276.10 277.54 A: oh yeah [noise] 

276.75 283.62 B: yeah so but that's per weight too it's like [noise] if i have two dumbbells and say i i buy a set of thirties 

283.53 294.95 B: it's not thirty seven cents per for thirty pounds thirty seven cents for six- sixty pounds [noise] so it's a little bit more than that would you know fill up and then also with the uh the free weights with the plates and all too 

291.50 292.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

294.78 304.54 B: i think they were the same thing where they were thirty seven cents a pound so but it's definitely it's a better deal than you know buy them brand new in the or something like that you know 

303.93 309.59 A: yeah you can catch them on sale and stuff and i just like to add to them now you know [noise] 

308.97 318.03 B: yeah yeah i know i i'm basically just waiting until i buy a house and get out of uh the apartment so that i can i i'm not gonna join a gym i 

318.26 329.90 B: wh- when i joined a gym i actually uh i i know a lot of people join gyms and don't really go and just let it go when i join a gym i actually uh i'm there three four times a week and once you start going 

329.89 334.12 B: it's almost like addictive like you have to keep going like you feel like when you don't go 

333.89 335.41 A: you're wasting your money 

334.13 338.73 B: you kin- yeah you're wasting your money and i also just feel like i'm just getting so much 

338.67 350.78 B: so much more out of shape by not missing by missing like two days which is weird because i haven't lifted and i haven't been in the gym in like a year and a half and you know i don't feel it it's not like 

350.74 357.32 B: it i i i would feel a lot worse if i'd missed two days if i went back to gym and i missed two days than i do of missing a year and a half 

357.30 358.05 A: (( yep [noise] )) 

357.81 359.35 B: yeah but [mn] 

358.98 363.99 A: [noise] yeah my brother he uh just started with uh power house he's over there a lot of time you know 

363.75 364.95 B: (( oh yeah )) 

364.38 370.69 A: it works real good for him you know but it's uh he was in a car accident and well 

366.16 366.98 B: yeah 

369.89 371.74 B: so so he's doing rehab too 

371.90 374.03 A: yeah he broke his shoulder 

373.78 374.77 B: oh aye 

374.15 378.26 A: he was hit broadside by somebody going 'bout ninety five miles an hour 

377.63 379.07 B: (( oh my god does )) 

378.73 385.32 A: and he's lucky to be alive and after a year you know he decided well [noise] he had motivation and stuff to go and uh 

385.45 388.71 A: you know he's been like a nut which um goes every day you know 

388.30 389.98 B: his shoulder still bother him 

389.35 395.43 A: [noise] no no he's like no he's uh yeah he's pressing four hundred pounds you know 

394.79 397.42 B: are you serious four hundred 

395.76 396.81 A: yeah 

397.16 398.17 A: (( yep )) 

397.47 402.59 B: i never got more than i got up to mm uh maybe two eighty is about the max i put up 

402.25 406.63 A: yeah well i don't i don't even get [noise] that [noise] high [cough] although i can 

406.69 410.70 A: uh roll a six hundred pound drum around all right i can move that but 

410.69 423.07 A: when i'm uh lifting by myself i gotta watch it you know when you're lifting four you're pushing four on a machine that's one thing but four on free weights there you're taking a chance you know 

415.12 416.64 B: yeah that's another thing 

418.59 420.63 B: yeah when you got free weights 

421.12 421.99 B: (( unless yeah )) 

422.29 425.56 B: yeah i would never [sigh] i would never do that 

424.29 429.45 A: it's balance and coordin- -ation all kinds of stuff you gotta [laughter] worry about [noise] 

426.60 427.48 B: yeah 

428.77 437.28 B: uh yeah i know even at the gym it's [laughter] if you don't have someone to spot ya which i uh i almost i used to always just go with myself after work and i never really had a 

437.21 444.31 B: steady person spot me i would just grab someone from the gym and just ask them to spot me while i was there but you're taking such a chance 

444.25 456.36 B: that you know you put too much weight on that thing you know comes down you can't get it up on- once it gets to a point you know you're not going to be able to get it back up and it's basically on your chest and depending on how much weight you have you know it could do some serious damage 

449.53 450.91 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

451.22 452.12 A: oh yeah [noise] 

456.33 466.31 B: and uh it's also pretty embarrassing turn [laughter] around have have everyone in the gym sitting there looking at you with the uh you know two hundred and fifty pounds in your chest and [laughter] 

459.16 460.96 A: oh no doubt you know [laughter] 

465.63 467.11 A: well i find uh 

467.13 469.68 A: you know if i get around two hundred [noise] 

469.69 476.01 A: and i just increase my reps you know and then uh and i'm fine [noise] i'm as strong as i need to be ever 

475.38 483.53 B: yeah that's kind of where i'm at now too is when i was you know lifting heavy you know it was when i was in my mid twenties now [noise] i'm like i'm thirty now so 

477.38 478.11 A: (( you know )) 

483.55 486.14 B: and i've stopped for a long time and uh i 

486.10 500.63 B: thought once i get back into it i'm not gonna be lifting really heavy weights anymore it'll just be more just to stay in shape and uh and and you know what else sucks is when you do lift heavy like that [noise] once you stop [noise] it it just turns to fat [noise] and all so it's 

499.95 502.19 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

500.77 506.93 B: that's not it's kind of counteractive i mean unless you're lifting for you know and clear in your fifties which 

507.08 507.92 B: (( you know )) 

507.10 512.07 A: yeah i'm not i don't [cough] believe in running too much that's why i believe god made cars you know 

511.55 515.42 B: yeah yeah i know you so you [noise] you ride a stationary [noise] bike you said [noise] [noise] [noise] 

514.81 518.27 A: yeah a little bit just for a warm up cool down you know but 

518.33 523.07 A: i usually have a dog around here and uh [noise] i just got a puppy and uh 

523.40 529.87 A: i bought two dogs a two year old and a puppy they're english setters 'cause i do some bird hunting and uh 

524.59 525.54 B: (( [noise] yeah ))

557.09 569.85 B: i can't throw a uh like a baseball or softball or football or anything like that full extension without it being extremely painful like almost [noise] coming out of the socket yeah where the ligaments just didn't heal right so 

567.90 569.10 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

570.10 572.06 B: that that really sucks 

570.48 571.61 A: (( [noise] [noise] ))

584.24 585.80 B: (( yeah yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

584.94 592.13 A: your knees and stuff some people can do it and it ain't for others but i can do a little walking you know that's good for me but 

591.28 592.44 B: yeah 

592.91 600.07 B: yeah same here uh i i i like i like walk around the park too i mean i like walking outside i mean it's that's kind of cool uh just
