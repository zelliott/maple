0.25 1.33 B: (( hello )) 

0.43 3.18 A: hi hi my name's alex 

2.96 4.44 B: hey my name's greg 

4.59 5.77 A: hi greg 

5.65 7.14 B: yeah how're you doing alex 

6.91 14.85 A: okay i i i understand the topic is censorship in the school system 

8.51 9.78 B: all right so 

14.08 18.92 B: yeah from what i understand yeah whether they can uh forbid people to read certain books [cough] 

18.79 23.98 A: uh i am personally against any type of censorship whatsoever [noise] 

24.53 25.20 B: (( [noise] )) 

25.38 30.24 B: i i am as well [noise] i i would say that um 

30.80 32.14 B: there's uh 

32.88 33.96 B: (( in )) 

34.41 41.20 B: i should say i'm i'm against censorship but i do think that uh there should be some sort of 

41.13 52.00 B: uh standard for age appropriateness i mean i think there's some things that might be appropriate for say a high school student to read that wouldn't be appropriate for a sixth grader to read 

51.43 53.41 A: right uh [noise] 

52.13 53.28 B: but uh 

53.94 57.81 B: outside of that no no i don't think that because uh 

57.77 69.62 B: you know somebody deems that a a book is uh you know not up to the standards that they want or something they should say that it's completely banned from a school system 

69.42 81.25 A: right and uh i think in recent uh months and recent years that there has a problem uh not not so much where i am in the uh north east but 

81.16 89.11 A: uh from what i've been reading in the papers it seems that it's a problem uh in some other parts of the country um 

87.16 91.90 B: it is well i live in the south so it it is somewhat here you know 

91.13 92.69 A: right 

92.23 94.23 B: probably more so than up there 

94.26 96.35 A: right 

94.39 95.36 B: (( and )) 

95.48 102.21 B: it makes me think you know [cough] i guess it was the the sixties or so uh [cough] 

102.22 110.21 B: fifties or sixties with catcher in the rye um the you know the same thing happened and then it was you know all over the united states but um 

109.67 115.74 A: right well well that went a little further than just books and cen- censorship they were actually burning books 

115.45 117.87 B: right exactly exactly 

116.40 126.79 A: [laughter] which which i guess is the strongest form of uh of censorship that there is um but all all too often uh we read where uh 

126.60 128.83 A: uh one person 

128.61 142.74 A: uh starts a campaign uh to get one book uh removed and it's not necessarily uh the views of the community but just this one person who has a big mouth and is able to convince other people to join the bandwagon 

142.52 147.33 A: and that's how these uh problems start uh i 

146.17 147.63 B: (( exactly my )) 

147.61 151.85 B: my uh my wife has a good friend that's a teacher in the memphis 

151.66 160.26 B: tennessee school system and uh she uh i think she teaches third grade and she was planning on having them read [cough] 

152.98 154.16 A: (( mhm )) 

160.07 171.48 B: one of the harry potter books next year but before before she can do that she has to send a uh a memo basically to all the parents to see if anyone disagrees 

162.63 163.61 A: right 

171.23 172.19 A: uh-huh 

171.53 176.64 B: and if if any one disagrees then she's not allowed to have them read that book [cough] 

176.18 181.47 A: so it only takes one person out of a whole class uh for them to say 

180.29 183.08 B: one person out of the yep to say no 

183.00 184.23 A: yeah well 

183.65 185.50 B: if they say no she can't do it 

185.26 192.34 A: uh-huh the last i heard the system that we use here democracy doesn't work on just one person it works on the majority 

192.16 193.62 B: right exactly 

193.34 196.19 A: so i guess that's a form of censorship 

195.80 205.85 B: i i would agree i think that's it's ridic- you know i do think that uh that there should be some decision left up to the parents and that [cough] there shouldn't be 

205.89 208.48 B: any book [cough] that is 

208.56 213.97 B: required reading that a parent wants to not have their child read i think they should 

213.84 223.69 B: they should give the book out and if if there is a parent who doesn't want their child to read it then they should be given an alternative um [cough] but i don't think it should be up to uh 

223.86 226.69 B: up to the school system or to uh 

226.71 234.85 B: to a government official to decide that you know no children are allowed to read this book because two or three people don't like you know i 

234.54 242.05 A: so so then what you're saying is school or government censorship of course is is no good but parent censorship 

242.16 243.65 A: would be fine 

243.71 250.77 B: would think so yeah i i i think it's i think uh [cough] as a parent i'm a you know i have a five year old 

244.82 245.73 A: uh-huh 

250.68 261.56 B: and i would be [cough] upset i mean i can't think of anything right now that is that is given as literature in in elementary school that i would have a problem with but 

260.89 261.73 A: right 

261.51 274.19 B: if something came up [cough] and i did i would be upset if i was told that my child had to read something that i disagreed with and that he would you know get a failing grade if if he didn't read it 

274.03 276.68 A: mhm so then 

274.43 275.26 B: (( um )) 

275.37 279.30 B: i would i think that that decision should be left up to me 

279.17 283.77 A: so so then you are for some sort of censorship 

283.86 284.92 B: uh 

285.20 291.24 B: i i guess i wouldn't call that censorship um the the reason i wouldn't is because uh 

291.57 293.22 B: [cough] censorship 

293.39 294.57 B: is 

294.93 299.92 B: uh only done from from the way i understand the definition of censorship 

299.71 300.77 A: right 

299.82 303.74 B: actually done by government or by uh 

303.52 315.29 B: officials in some [cough] in some manner if i prohibit my child from uh listening to certain music or watching certain movies or reading certain books [cough] 

314.71 316.51 A: (( mhm )) 

315.94 323.87 B: i am yes i am censoring what my child does but i wouldn't call that censorship in the broad in the broad sense of the word 

323.87 333.47 A: okay so but so i guess what you're saying is that being a good parent does call for some sort of cens- censorship at at times 

333.11 335.17 B: yes oh yes definitely 

334.33 335.95 A: yeah 

335.22 336.73 B: [cough] i think so 

336.66 337.67 A: mhm 

336.71 342.84 B: because i mean there are definitely books out there and some of it i have read as an adult 

342.73 353.25 B: that i don't think is [cough] although they can be understood by say a ten or twelve year old i don't think they're appropriate for a child to read at that age 

352.63 354.12 A: okay and 

353.07 365.34 B: maybe when they're fifteen or sixteen but not at that age and and if they were told that that was a book they were supposed to be reading i think i should have the choice to say you know i would like my child to be given an alternative 

365.24 376.00 A: mhm and and you realize that censorship is just not uh solely uh reading and books it's also in- involves music 

375.83 387.78 A: and in fact and and in fact music i i think might even be more of a problem uh than books right now uh i happen to teach music 

376.07 377.18 B: oh completely 

387.80 389.44 B: oh wonderful [noise] 

388.03 397.93 A: and uh i am the band director of a school now we deal strictly with notes we don't get involved with words or anything of that nature 

397.85 398.64 B: sure 

397.86 409.37 A: but yet at time to time especially during the holiday winter season and we're not allowed to use the word christmas we we have to call it the holiday winter season 

409.24 417.16 A: uh occasionally uh we get complaints from parents who have problems with songs that the band is playing 

416.95 426.62 A: now the problem is that it is maybe in their views religious in nature but what's religious in nature is the words 

423.32 424.07 B: right 

426.60 427.52 B: correct 

426.84 430.98 A: music music has no uh 

431.27 438.39 A: uh um religious cona- connotation to it it's the words 

436.38 437.51 B: exactly 

438.20 452.92 A: but yet even though we're not we have nothing to do with words the band just plays music people object at times to the music that we're playing luckily the school doesn't stand behind them and i have carte blanche to perform whatever i 

453.05 467.26 A: i want but i find it discouraging uh that that uh people do feel that they have the right to say that we shouldn't perform something even though what they are against is not what we're doing 

466.86 477.16 B: right right i agree actually i grew i grew up uh in a band as well so i was so i was in marching band and concert band in junior high and high school and uh 

471.40 472.47 A: mhm 

475.87 476.86 A: right 

477.00 487.93 B: so we went through some of the same things at at that time it wasn't as much i mean that was a good ten to fifteen years ago and it wasn't so much uh 

488.36 499.07 B: uh usually things related to religion as much as it was i i went to a private school and my school would have had problems for example uh 

494.37 495.31 A: mhm 

499.93 501.21 B: playing 

501.24 507.91 B: uh one of the songs we played was uh the song tequila that we did at prep rallies [cough] 

505.78 508.55 A: mhm right 

507.99 522.75 B: and even though we we didn't say it we didn't even say the word tequila in the song we just did just the music but we had you know parent complain about that when we did that and and our school decided that we couldn't do it anymore 

518.52 520.10 A: because 

522.60 526.21 A: and and the problem they were having because 

526.56 530.49 A: uh why tequila is an alcoholic beverage 

530.72 544.26 B: yes exactly exactly i went to a private school that uh that was uh was fairly strict and a lot of the parents there especially the ones with money and when you're dealing with a private school that's where they get their money from as opposed to the government 

531.92 534.42 A: oh [laughter] 

542.89 545.77 A: right right 

544.14 554.00 B: so it was the parents who were providing the uh the funds to the school were saying we don't want this so the school it was more political in nature 

554.06 561.24 B: uh [cough] just like it would be in a in a public school as well but the politics is a little bit different when you're dealing in the in the private sector 

561.48 562.33 B: (( uh )) 

561.55 566.32 A: [laughter] so so their problem was just with that one word tequila 

566.01 569.01 B: pretty much yeah and uh 

567.74 570.08 A: oh that's a new one on me 

569.17 578.89 B: [laughter] and then we we sure enough stopped playing the song i mean it was we asked our band director why and and he was you know pretty much straightforward with us and told us that they had 

572.27 573.25 A: uh-huh 

578.71 592.27 B: complaints from some parents at the football games that that we were promoting drinking basically i guess is what they were saying even though i wouldn't see it that way at all as a as a youth or as an adult you know [noise] 

588.99 591.17 A: and and 

591.86 596.09 A: and what would have happened if you changed the title of the song to fruit punch 

596.34 599.89 B: [laughter] uh you know i would have uh
