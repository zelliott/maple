55.61 65.78 A: prior to that i was in europe for about six years and australia for two years and then asia for i was brought up in asia so having come from having traveled all around having known 

65.85 77.73 A: personally i haven't made any changes i g- but i'm i leave it to you in the sense that the way how u._s. um ah perceives other countries the way how u._s. 

77.59 83.19 A: international and the national policies are frame it affects a lot um 

83.05 86.95 A: and i think probably to into that fact a lot more even the future 

86.73 97.76 A: and um um iraq was one of them ah nine eleven was the second one i mean nine on- was the first one iraq was the second ah so ah basically d- um 

97.58 111.56 A: um people pay for the prices the government um in terms of prices the government makes the foolish um policies some of the international policies are very stupid hypocritical double sided and 

110.42 111.71 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

111.57 113.51 A: so that's what i feel i 

112.71 114.14 B: i agree with you 

114.18 116.90 A: mean it's because of mine i mean 

116.91 121.79 A: not to be blind sided towards the m- pro o- jew or the pro 

121.61 135.54 A: arab but least he know ah i mean any any lobbying basically just looking for money you might have taken point of view and turn- try and taking it from a really straight angle the wa- the double sided has that the u._s. has in terms of various policies i think has affected 

129.39 130.28 B: (( mhm )) 

135.39 138.86 A: (( and ultimately its people has to um ah )) 

138.79 148.64 A: um basically are left to the um face with the various issues in terms of all kinds it affects i mean if you ask anybody 

148.44 154.36 A: for people in the u._s. yeah it does af- probably it has affected them personally maybe yes a lot but 

154.35 165.42 A: if you talk anybody in asia i think they're they're almost used to it in terms of the various terrorists that any terrorist organization can perceive until now u._s. wasn't affected but now it knows what 

165.37 170.65 A: the terrorist affect can do not only to your country but also to the person living m- ah so 

170.68 174.04 B: (( right [laughter] i know that's right )) 

173.30 174.09 A: so 

174.10 176.45 A: (( so i think i think ah um )) 

176.32 188.06 A: i mean personally i mean you see a lot of security the the some of the things that you see is the lot of food check checkpoints and y- in and the domestic international travel and some other things but i mean 

187.88 198.25 A: i'm just a good but i'm not sure if somebody really wants to attack ah or somebody really wants to um bypass security they can very well do so even now you know 

197.55 199.20 B: yeah [laughter] oh yeah [laughter] 

198.57 203.80 A: oh yes so they're they're the well this well ah a person will think twice now 

203.91 216.42 A: could do it ah w- without thinking he wanted to e- but i mean even now we we just try to and we spend billions and billions in u._s. and i just sometimes just laugh at it you know i mean i mean it's like 

214.65 216.03 B: mhm 

216.32 217.00 A: (( n- )) 

216.89 231.70 A: well but ah well they are doing something so that that's good but ah i i think they could still do much better and just by putting the proper policies itself i mean and that could actually relieve a lot of um 

224.35 225.74 B: yes i agree 

231.56 243.86 A: frustration that people in other countries have towards the u._s. you know it's not the people here the people of u._s. are very nice it is the problem is with the federal and the government folks that will set all the stupid policies and 

240.93 241.74 B: yes 

243.08 244.80 B: i agree [laughter] 

244.31 254.99 A: so um people are very nice they're very nice they just pe- but ultimately the people are t- ah the people b- ah get a burnt out of burden in terms of all the atrocities you know 

254.12 255.66 B: (( mm )) 

255.35 257.82 A: so so anything else 

257.48 261.95 B: oh [sigh] well i think it's really what na- can may i ask you what nationality you are 

261.70 263.47 A: oh i i'm indian 

263.05 266.64 B: that's very interesting i have a lot of good friends at my school that are indian 

266.47 267.43 A: yeah 

266.57 280.57 B: and i well i agree i think before we thought w- we were this ah untouchable place and like nothing we could pretty much get away with anything but now we're realizing that we really need to take responsibility for our actions 

275.86 276.73 A: yeah 

280.47 291.05 A: y- and and and i think even now after the nine eleven attack the the b- things where people elsewhere and outside u._s. um having having traveled a lot people think is that 

290.87 304.56 A: (( the ah the the frankness or the basically what i mean the the bragging of that ah bragging it to other people how and so u._s. is so big the u._s. can do anything that is wrong you know )) 

303.94 305.08 B: yeah 

304.46 306.02 A: and i think that was 

305.78 308.61 A: that has at least come down on its knees 

308.41 318.48 A: in terms of well you you any country no matter how powerful or strong it is can not perceive it cannot be untouchable even russia has broken down so 

318.29 324.34 A: u._s. can as well in time you know so for that yeah so that's what people need to pursue and just 

319.69 322.04 B: oh [laughter] [laughter] yep [laughter] 

324.15 335.32 A: be more humble and and and be more um ah ah not even be proud possible that's fine but keep a very open mind when they make decision that's all you can say you know 

334.91 336.10 B: right 

335.54 336.57 A: (( yeah so )) 

336.67 347.97 A: i think having traveling all these places i think ah you just trying to keep very open approach and try to mix with all the folks and try to see the what best you can do for the country you know 

347.61 348.54 B: huh 

348.34 361.31 A: so so that's that's what i think and so personally yeah nothing much change yeah m- m- i'm we receive if you are going to die you you will anyway so [laughter] um doesn't matter you know so 

357.96 359.90 B: right it's true 

360.05 361.21 B: it's true 

361.33 373.34 A: so that's that's what i believe but i mean i don't know what your beliefs are in terms of before and after nine eleven in terms or your in terms of the other views in terms of ah did it affect your 

373.35 377.92 A: um family or did it affect your friends or somebody else 

377.64 379.22 B: well um 

379.45 387.76 B: i mean it it did it i mean i live right outside the city so yeah i really felt the impact of like what happened but um 

382.40 383.04 A: (( mm )) 

388.88 403.47 B: a- it just i think it woke people up i mean some people saw it as like a cry of war and like they just even got even more into the whole war thing but i'll it i think a lotta people it woke them up to what's actually going on in the world and foreign policy 

403.32 413.24 B: and you know people just go about their lives happily before they didn't care what the government was doing but i- but now i think a lotta people are realizing that we have to be more 

408.80 409.75 A: yeah 

413.62 420.02 B: aware of what we're doing 'cause it is affecting other countries and what happened on nine eleven is a big show of 

420.22 425.84 B: how what we're doing is affecting other countries in a negative way and ah 

425.61 437.14 B: we're we're kinda just being real pushy and before we thought we could get away with it and now i- like we're realizing we're not untouchable and 

436.04 438.60 A: (( yeah th- th- i think i think that's a really )) 

438.36 451.72 A: good relation that people i think i mean i think it already has it's a i think um that's that's good so it it at least people now ah will pay more attention s- to some some more extent probably 

451.64 454.62 A: and um that's that's good i mean 

454.75 463.41 A: in in terms of my thing my so- so- some of friends our good friends in new york who who did get affect in the initial five six months but then all i think they have 

463.23 473.64 A: ah put the life together and ah gone on in fact one of my distant m- relatives friends he actually died he he was there yeah yeah working so 

470.51 471.34 B: (( ah wow )) 

472.86 473.76 B: (( oh )) 

473.64 486.78 A: so i so i know at least one person who who died whom i knew of indirectly but um i think it's very sad that so many people died and and and this had to happen but um there's nothing that 

480.78 481.62 B: (( mhm )) 

485.51 487.41 B: (( happening everything yeah yeah yeah yes i agree )) 

486.79 501.73 A: yeah yeah yeah so maybe but there's nothing that um as people that we can do you know and so and ah what we can do is just try to ah practically ah take care of our lives put them together and see what we could do in future to 

501.69 504.80 A: (( um help others as well you know or something )) 

503.17 504.23 B: (( mm )) 

504.74 512.41 B: (( yeah hm )) 

504.93 514.37 A: that's all i can say you know so life life goes on things happen things happen for a reason and so was nine eleven that's the way i perceive it you know 

514.46 518.20 A: beat somalia beat iraq beat afghanistan beat ah 

517.98 521.25 A: bali or beat the bombings in bali or beat um 

521.25 533.79 A: beat in the u._s. you know it's a or beat in chechnya and russia at the same thing with all the acts of terrorism i mean they shouldn't happen same goes on in in israel and palestine as well so so 

535.59 536.58 A: [sigh] 

535.80 540.00 B: mu- you're a very smart person and i- it's good to talk to people who have ah 

540.33 550.84 B: international views like 'cause growing up in america you know we don't have we had a pretty skewed perception or a misshapen perception of the world like you know 

550.02 556.95 A: yeah well i can it's not your fault it's the way that people typically you haven't talked to any people that's the way i think people 

556.82 567.22 A: um d- i mean that's the way people are brought up and i think the education affects there's the cultural affect i think there are a number of thing affects it so when i think it's 

567.12 571.52 A: if you grow up in a country where you don't have luxuries that people have here in u._s. you 

571.32 579.43 A: typically get tuned to all those various things as well you know because your people take things many things as luxury 

574.98 577.75 B: (( mm )) 

579.08 579.90 B: (( yeah )) 

579.21 586.46 A: so [laughter] that's the that's the problem you know so but if you go outside to any other um um 

586.47 599.90 A: ah ah economy ca- poorly or developing countries you will try to ah see that things are different and you'll try you'll try to sh- not assume everything is a luxury even getting water is not luxury [laughter] even to the poor
