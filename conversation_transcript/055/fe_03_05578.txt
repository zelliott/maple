29.06 30.89 B: horrible thing to happen 

30.73 31.77 A: mhm 

31.26 41.48 B: ah so i don't know maybe i'm a little more cautious about things i see people with packages and stuff especially riding the trains 

40.96 42.36 A: mhm 

41.96 50.26 B: and i'll make sure they don't leave 'em walk away from 'em well so i guess there is a change yeah 

45.41 46.39 A: (( oh )) 

48.84 58.16 A: so anyway you would say you are more vigilant right like you know try to be more aware of your surroundings and things like that 

52.61 54.94 B: yeah 

55.63 58.94 B: yeah right right 

58.29 67.28 A: yeah that's the same thing with me too about the only thing [mn] i am more skeptical now on ah flying [laughter] than 

67.10 68.03 B: uh-huh 

67.71 75.51 A: than i was because every single time i just cannot can't help myself but thinking you know like how 

75.51 76.73 B: yeah 

75.60 87.94 A: these people who were getting on those planes how w- they were happy even they were going either on vacation or they were going to make it home to see their loved ones and everything 

88.05 91.43 A: and then and then all these things happened so 

88.14 90.09 B: yeah 

91.63 103.15 A: like i say september eleven y- you know it makes me in a way not only it makes me a little bit more skeptical about things but it makes me in a way too like 

103.13 107.21 A: living more than i used to 

107.23 108.38 B: uh-huh 

107.91 113.83 A: because you know like u- usually you make plans for the next four five years 

113.84 120.56 A: you know what you're gonna do how you're gonna be retired you're gonna do this and you'd never live for the day 

113.98 115.29 B: yeah 

120.52 121.79 B: oh it's true 

120.86 133.87 A: and and i think september e- eleven like make people like you should you know take more like you see people even spend more doing their holidays giving gifts and praise and you know 

133.40 144.36 B: m- i g- and i guess it makes people appreciate life more not take it for granted i know it makes me not take it for granted anymore you know 

137.23 138.88 A: (( i- yeah more a- )) 

143.45 144.29 A: (( i- it )) 

144.57 147.65 B: 'cause i used to just take things for granted ah 

144.58 145.96 A: yeah they 

146.85 148.18 A: mhm 

147.95 149.16 B: but now 

149.27 153.33 B: i'm a little more cautious and caring about things than i used to be 

153.16 162.12 A: but y- you know in the way too we have to make sure that we're not become like paranoid you know like we've 

160.89 170.66 B: no that's true too unless it's very easy to become paranoid nowadays but you have to be careful about that 

162.15 164.27 A: (( if all the yeah )) 

165.69 167.64 A: i can mhm 

169.67 175.04 A: yeah like some people once they see you know like it's no secret 

174.86 188.38 A: that ah when these things happen it's more or less like we have more people from the middle east you know in that did that and some people now they are kind of discriminate more 

181.78 182.86 B: yeah 

183.49 184.72 B: yeah 

188.37 190.31 A: against these people 

189.93 191.42 B: yeah 

190.52 194.63 A: and i you know i am a foreigner too maybe if 

194.64 201.24 A: you for my part of the world that would have been the same [laughter] thing they would the way they would treat me too 

201.32 203.71 B: i imagine so yeah 

202.90 214.29 A: so this is what i try to make sure and you know like you you try to in one way try to y- you know like ah 

214.66 220.79 A: try to think about these people who did that but not everybody who is from 

220.56 231.46 A: that part of the country he is you know as bad as the responsible for that and it's very hard for some people to make that difference you know 

222.87 224.99 B: is responsible that's true 

230.44 238.60 B: right true it is ah and and i think is is wrong because of one person who'd 

238.89 241.06 B: ah or the people the group or whatever 

241.56 243.19 B: who is responsible 

243.22 244.32 A: yeah 

243.36 250.72 B: to hold a whole race responsible for the incident no that that wouldn't be right and it's 

249.81 252.35 A: yeah th- th- that's what i say 

251.00 253.00 B: that wouldn't be right at all 

252.46 253.51 A: (( mm )) 

253.50 254.25 B: (( no )) 

254.20 264.88 A: that's what i say it's very it's it's it's very good to be as you said more cautious about the things we do the things you know the way we live our lives 

264.40 265.49 B: true 

264.92 272.09 A: but then again we will try to be aware of being ah you know paranoia y- als- also 

270.91 275.74 B: yeah be more aware of your surroundings and that's true 

273.60 274.77 A: yeah 

275.89 277.77 B: you know but 

276.19 283.46 A: ah because even airline now it seem now long time ago like before the september the eleventh 

283.21 284.11 B: yeah 

283.44 295.04 A: you can be like half hour like you know to be to a plane and then you- you're there you know they let you in but nowadays they said you have to be there two hours or 

288.11 289.18 B: (( mhm )) 

291.32 292.23 B: yeah 

295.25 302.47 A: factor of time money you pay more money for taxis because they have to hire all these people 

302.89 304.01 A: so y- 

304.10 309.97 A: you know you cannot trust people everything kind of turn upside down 

310.07 313.39 B: yeah a bit a bit yeah that's true 

311.21 324.73 A: [laughter] and we all we always on high alert you know like whatever i- i- it just can help you for anybody not to be skeptical about everything 

324.61 337.67 B: yeah well it's it's good to be skeptical about things but not overly skeptical you know when it makes you paranoid like you were saying well i'd say you have to be careful of that ah 

325.94 326.52 A: (( ah y- )) 

329.97 331.27 A: yeah 

333.04 342.32 A: yes so it would consume your life too yeah you be careful because if you go ah if you are living on the extreme 

342.48 355.99 A: so that doesn't help at all because you know god gives you like your life to live [noise] and then here you are you worried so much then you let the days go by that you could have had a good day 

344.54 345.62 B: no 

355.58 357.67 B: that's true that's true

388.96 390.03 B: right 

389.47 398.47 A: (( like they were supposed to and that was september eleventh you know th- that does for a lot of people then on )) 

398.79 410.71 A: on the other hand some people too they live they try to live so much like thinks it's gonna be the end of the world tomorrow they are in bad go into bankruptcy you know [laughter] 

410.70 412.72 B: (( h- yeah ))
