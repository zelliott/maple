0.11 1.15 A: hello 

0.25 3.38 B: hi i'm kevin um 

2.59 4.38 A: hi kevin i'm matt 

3.83 5.31 B: matt how are you 

5.11 6.44 A: good how are you 

6.26 8.58 B: good um where you from matt 

8.39 11.72 A: [noise] i'm from um chicago but i've just moved to new york how about you 

11.26 15.91 B: oh wow that's so crazy i'm from chicago but i just moved to new york too [laughter] 

15.51 17.88 A: weird um [mn] 

16.47 18.47 B: yeah 

18.18 20.04 A: well that's 

19.16 22.40 B: have you made any changes in your life since september eleventh 

22.22 25.29 A: um [lipsmack] i don't know i 

25.59 30.91 A: uh probably a little bit of a mindset change just because it was like such shocking stuff but um 

29.69 31.82 B: mhm 

31.34 34.99 A: by this point i mean what is it a year and a half almost two years 

35.01 49.10 A: um like th- any different sort of mindset is so in- ingrained in us like it's it's not it doesn't seem like a change but yeah probably like and i probably think a little different just about 

49.51 52.43 A: uh you know being on crowded trains and stuff like that 

51.89 53.86 B: mhm 

52.71 57.89 A: 'cause you know i've never really thought about it may- may- some people did some people did and i don't think i did very much 

57.57 59.54 B: right 

58.24 61.33 A: although of course it was a wake up call and maybe uh 

61.49 67.72 A: i sorted one um with the cost of like innocent lives of course but how about you 

63.00 64.63 B: mhm 

68.37 70.28 B: i wouldn't say that i have 

70.10 71.51 A: [noise] 

70.79 78.54 B: actually even in mindset i don't think that i've changed all that much in part i mean when it initially happened it was shocking um 

78.53 90.85 B: i think for everyone i had just gotten back from out of the country and you know i came back like a couple of days right before september eleventh and you come back to america and you feel like this 

86.71 87.61 A: mhm 

91.01 99.59 B: i don't know this is a place where nothing like that would happen and then some- something of that magnitude happened and that was shocking but i think so much has 

99.89 111.79 B: passed since september eleventh that it also starts to be put into perspective you know with the the wars and everything i think that i i i don't really 

109.03 109.90 A: mhm 

112.27 125.51 B: i have to say that well i really feel that if anything has changed it's made me i'm more conscious of how say ashcroft has really been deteriorating [laughter] our civil liberties and that's something that scares me more than 

125.66 126.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

125.75 128.90 B: a potential um uh 

129.21 133.27 B: another strike yeah 

129.63 140.82 A: another attack right yeah um in terms of politics yeah i don't i don't think much has changed if anything the bush administration is like capitalizing on 

140.89 148.49 A: you know or manipulating it so that things like the iraq war and things like what happened in afghanistan are justified when really 

148.73 159.17 A: you know in the big- bigger picture they're not but you have about seventy five percent of americans convinced that unless those wars take place that they're not safe so 

159.05 160.46 B: right 

160.67 162.21 A: (( um yeah i agree with you )) 

160.73 173.57 B: yeah i think that the fear factor um about a terrorist attack perhaps is a little bit out of proportion i think that you know th- th- that moment i think that it is horrifying and when you see something like what happens in 

166.76 167.83 A: (( [noise] )) 

173.43 181.39 B: in palestine or in israel or you know that it it happens worldwide too but this is the first time perhaps it has happened in america 

178.48 179.60 A: mhm 

181.21 194.75 B: but i still feel like there's other things that threaten us more than you know things like um i don't know like h._i._v. and these types of things that i wish there were more attention put on that rather than building a whole new 

189.24 190.14 A: right 

195.11 200.89 B: level of government to to be able to police people and things like that but 

199.16 200.16 A: yeah 

201.06 201.97 B: um 

201.16 203.38 A: well it is a fear based 

202.30 204.64 B: so when you i'm sorry 

203.68 206.87 A: [mn] it is a fear based sort of society here 

206.59 208.79 B: (( yeah )) 

207.48 210.32 A: people don't think the same way other places i don't think 

210.06 214.55 B: yeah i wond- but i i don't maybe it's starting to change people do seem to 

214.61 223.96 B: start to as time moves on that they just doesn't perhaps well you said you just recently did you just recently move how recently did you move to new york 

222.21 224.71 A: yeah i'm two weeks here not even 

224.61 228.79 B: [laughter] that's so strange yeah me too oh i just 

229.29 238.05 B: got here i mean i've been visiting here before but i've been living here and i don't notice at least for me on the street i don't feel like there's um 

232.16 233.00 A: (( uh-huh )) 

238.83 250.65 B: any heightened awareness about say terrorist attacks or anything um do you feel like it's different in coming from chicago and going to new york that there's a different in new york 

244.45 245.32 A: yeah 

250.53 256.49 A: um at this point no i was here last summer you know closer to the fact and um 

257.01 264.19 A: i might have felt a little differently then but i also like there was big scare when i was here i was only here for two days last summer 

263.95 264.81 B: mhm 

264.49 277.92 A: and there was a big scare or something with they had to turn off all the lights in midtown because they thought a plane was gonna try to or something was gonna happen and that was a little freaky 'cause like it was you know i'm i'm in chicago most of the time i worked in the loop 

272.25 273.39 B: oh wow 

278.09 279.18 A: um 

279.38 285.07 A: you you know you're just scared there i i i worked in ann tower at the time of september eleventh 

281.50 283.23 B: right 

284.66 286.64 B: which tower i'm sorry 

286.00 288.95 A: the ann tower it's the whole annico building 

286.76 287.90 B: uh-huh 

287.91 290.61 B: right right 

289.20 290.81 A: and um 

291.27 292.70 A: you know like 

291.75 294.74 B: they told you guys to go home and everything 

294.33 298.93 A: well see here's a funny quick little story i was i didn't go to work that day 

299.01 306.21 A: and i had and it was just like a good thing i didn't because of course it was like panic on the stairwells of the ann tower 

305.94 307.43 B: right 

306.20 318.53 A: and um my ma called and called my cellphone and asked you know if i was evacuating and i was you know i was embarrassed to tell her like no i'm in bed i didn't go to work she said go turn on the t._v. and i turned it on 

318.43 321.84 A: and i thought the ann tower was on fire 'cause they look the same 

321.44 324.71 B: right 

322.22 333.47 A: but then in any event it was really traumatizing because i worked in um like customer service so that i worked a lot with a lot of the am people in new york which of course were all on the hundredth floor 

333.20 335.45 B: oh so you know somebody who 

335.62 337.34 A: oh i knew a lot of people 

336.76 338.11 B: oh wow 

338.03 350.62 A: so and it was all through work but it was like you know those are the relationships you have like for a long time and they're work relationships in the distance and i couldn't put a face to the people but i could definitely put a voice to the name so 

344.03 344.99 B: right 

350.92 360.26 A: and that was kinda rough and then like um there's also a lot of am people in a buil- another building that went down that they thought they were going to evacuate so it was just like a really 

360.30 363.52 A: i mean besides the like obvious trauma like it was 

363.75 368.09 A: personally [laughter] striking and like i didn't go to work the next day either because 

364.72 366.10 B: right 

367.54 372.31 B: sure i think everyone the next day was a mess [laughter] 

371.49 375.94 A: yeah well of course i mean like the loop was under insane 

375.99 376.97 A: um 

376.74 378.26 B: security and 

377.61 382.90 A: right and i d- i did i did go the thursday like the thursday the thirteenth 

382.98 384.15 A: and um 

383.03 384.86 B: right 

384.56 388.34 A: like it was just and it took me an hour and forty five minutes to get in the building 

388.39 392.59 A: and then um i mean i was actually i got laid off in 

393.16 394.94 A: sort of like as a 

395.06 397.61 B: consequence of yeah 

395.07 396.73 A: result of the attack 

396.78 401.23 A: because ann had lost so many people like the kinda just needed to like restart somewhere 

401.19 402.24 B: i see 

401.58 404.85 A: they actually recuperated really well but um 

405.22 414.31 B: so now in new york are you are you um in another tall building and d- are you conscious you know are you in a skyscraper in the 

405.22 406.13 A: some of the 

412.53 414.51 A: um you know 

414.66 419.16 A: at this point it doesn't bother me i'm not in too many tall buildings i don't have a job right now 

418.99 420.27 B: right 

419.65 420.71 A: um 

421.02 422.05 A: so 

422.26 426.70 A: like i live in brooklyn um in williamsburg so i mean 

427.01 429.09 A: we're not in very tall buildings over here 

428.63 430.89 B: right 

429.57 432.49 A: but um [noise] no i'm not 

431.00 444.97 B: yeah i mean i live in manhattan but i live far enough away i mean but even if i did i don't i still it would be hard for me to feel like i would i'm sorry like targeted right i wouldn't feel i i don't think 

439.02 440.35 A: like targeted 

441.33 442.46 A: (( feel targeted )) 

444.76 455.48 B: i think the it's just a once in a lifetime thing it's difficult for me to imagine it happening again i think that the next time it will be so i- if there is another attack it will be 

450.68 451.70 A: mhm 

455.55 467.88 B: in a place that we don't expect and it will be a method that we don't expect something like you know poisoning water supply or something like that something's that just as scary but you know like the tokyo subway attacks and these types of things 

459.15 460.08 A: mhm 

467.28 468.36 A: right 

468.15 476.58 B: so i just think that there's so many ways that they could strike us but at a certain point you don't want to be paranoid so i mean i wanna be alert but i don't want to 

476.95 483.51 B: you know build my whole life around being paranoid that there could be a terrorist attack at any minute 

479.43 480.96 A: (( no definitely not )) 

483.79 490.94 A: no i just i just remember like the first couple of mon- like do you remember waking waking up september twelfth that morning and 

490.76 492.89 B: yeah [laughter] 

491.15 498.91 A: you were just like oh shit it's like this had really happened 'cause there was such a like it seemed like such a fictitious day like it was really just a big movie 

498.71 500.51 B: yeah i was 

499.45 506.15 A: and of course if you were watching the news all day too like even more so then because they have you like tap in into the mhm 

505.33 518.96 B: well i think i everyone was just i mean i think we were all in a collective we were just collectively stunned for the for a week after that i couldn't get anything done you know i was trying to run around chicago and i had to like i said i'd just gotten back and i was trying to get things 

519.08 529.00 B: um in order before i went back to school and i couldn't think about anything else and when i was talking with people that's all we talked about and so nothing got done it seemed like for 

529.12 532.88 B: for a week or two you know it was kinda crazy 

531.12 532.33 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

533.07 541.37 A: yeah some uncomfortable conversations i just went monday um i was walking around battery park with some of my friends just kinda wandering 

539.93 542.64 B: mhm mhm 

541.65 544.78 A: and like stumbled upon ground zero for the first time 

544.99 546.67 B: really 

545.01 550.94 A: not really knowing like where i was and i i kinda saw the lights and everything and i kinda figured that's what it was 

550.50 556.23 B: right yeah i went to it was actually a free concert of patty smith and um 

551.46 552.16 A: (( so )) 

556.53 561.14 B: and you know everyone was there it was a big crowd and uh 

561.58 575.30 B: [noise] there were i did notice wh- at the concert that there were um security guards on the top of the building and everything [laughter] watching us which was which was a little bizarre when you're aware of just how much security perhaps is around us now 

575.17 576.20 A: yeah 

575.72 578.24 B: so but 

576.28 585.96 A: yeah i i just notice a difference in new york in general because there's like there's not armed guards standing in in all the loop subways [laughter] not really 

584.85 594.01 B: right but i mean every once in a while when you um at the airports and stuff you see these guys with you know semi automatic weapons and stuff like that i never saw that before 

593.96 599.95 B: which does seem a little strange have you seen that yeah i think that that 

596.44 597.01 A: (( [mn] )) 

597.37 598.82 A: (( yeah yeah ))
