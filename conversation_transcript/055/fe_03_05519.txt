28.22 29.24 B: oh okay 

28.82 36.96 A: [sigh] uh i i like all sports but the only thing i do competitively now and and just for exercise is martial arts [sigh] 

36.98 45.36 A: i um you know i'm a very big person um six oh three hundred so i don't [sigh] people don't think that heavy people 

45.18 54.12 A: work out but i i walk uh i walk every day and [sigh] do a lot of lifting and of course then i do my martial arts work outs three to four times a week [sigh] 

54.00 60.19 A: uh it's very important for for people of all sizes all shapes and all ages to be in shape i think 

59.50 67.60 B: [noise] yeah i i just found that out recently um [lipsmack] [sigh] i found out my sugar content was very high [laughter] [noise] 

64.50 65.69 A: oh man 

66.19 68.30 A: [sigh] yeah i'm a type two diabetic 

68.10 69.24 B: [cough] oh are you 

68.99 77.14 A: [sigh] you know that's one reason i work out so much because um [sigh] what happened was i had been involved in sports all my life [sigh] um [lipsmack] 

70.79 71.76 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

77.13 91.85 A: but from the time i was about say twenty twenty two [sigh] into my thirties um i did no physical activity whatsoever [mn] um [sigh] i mean i i i tentatively tried i was like well you know 

92.12 95.48 A: working out and stuff and i would join health clubs here and [sigh] 

94.25 95.62 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] [noise] 

95.38 106.26 A: try to walk and try to run and i even played semi pro football for a while but [sigh] i never just worked out or really just tried to keep myself in any kind of condition [sigh] 

106.11 120.63 A: and i went through all kinds of stress shortly after i had my first child [sigh] um had a lot of problems and i got real i was eating all kinds of junk and got really sick and ended up in hospital with a [sigh] really really high content 

120.48 122.65 B: [laughter] my um what is it 

122.66 124.53 A: what was it at the time [noise] 

123.80 131.32 B: uh no no um for me personally um [sigh] yeah my doctor basically said i have to lose about ten to fifteen pounds 

130.23 132.39 A: oh then you're probably not too bad off 

131.68 135.43 B: yeah then i can start eating whatever i want to eat again [laughter] 

134.33 142.95 A: well i'm telling you this if your c- if you're sugar content's up [sigh] you shouldn't really eat certain things like i know i've been low carbing for a while 

142.36 144.30 B: yeah i've gone on the atkins 

143.71 146.72 A: yeah yeah atk- i'm telling you atkins is 

145.82 147.48 B: yeah and staying away from the meat [noise] 

147.90 152.18 A: well [sigh] here's a thing um a- as an old atkins person 

152.54 157.66 A: [sigh] uh what i found is that it's really effective but [sigh] 

157.65 170.04 A: if you eat a whole lot of protein and a- and uh a whole lot of these other things that's not good for you either even though [sigh] for in the short run and in the medium run you're going to keep the weight off 

169.63 171.01 B: (( [sigh] uh-huh )) 

170.07 178.36 A: [sigh] but but later on in in the process you're going to get sick of eating just that and and your body's going to adapt to eating just that and you'll put the weight on again 

178.92 186.12 A: [sigh] so atkins um [sigh] a strict atkins diet in my opinion is not particularly good for you [sigh] 

186.09 195.06 A: uh but if you do a more balanced diet but but really cut down on the carbs and eat moderate amounts of fats rather than high amounts of fats [sigh] 

195.12 197.16 A: that'll that'll do well 

196.34 203.30 B: [noise] yeah i mean i i went to lunch today i was trying to think [sigh] what can i possibly eat [laughter] you know [laughter] 

202.90 204.38 A: what did you settle on 

203.99 205.76 B: [sigh] oh i had uh 

206.33 212.07 B: i had some uh vegetables so i had some grilled vegetables and um [sigh] some salad [sigh] 

208.74 209.87 A: (( yeah )) 

212.48 221.43 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] it sounds that sounds like a pretty good deal uh you know protein is always good to have when on i [sigh] when i eat salads i eat um 

221.54 233.15 A: [sigh] almost always have chicken or some type of protein some type of meat you know a really small amount but i always try [sigh] you know tuna to chicken or tuna on a salad that's a really good situation 

230.14 231.46 B: (( yeah yeah [noise] )) 

232.81 235.21 B: yeah i had tuna fish sandwich yesterday [sigh] 

234.53 237.15 A: do you do any kind of working out

255.58 257.01 B: (( yeah [cough] [noise] ))

424.15 425.28 B: (( [sigh] i )) 

426.53 427.95 B: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] )) 

428.15 438.92 B: [sigh] i mean it's not like i sna- ever snacked a lot before or anything [sigh] but you know before i u- just used to eat the you know three three meals a day and [sigh] you know maybe something like a small [noise] a real small dessert [sigh]
