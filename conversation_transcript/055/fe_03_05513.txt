6.35 7.56 A: oh whatever 

7.23 8.09 B: (( whatever )) 

7.99 11.30 A: did you get the topic i couldn't really hear her what she was saying 

11.04 14.01 B: (( yeah me neither it sounded like she said something about do you think that )) 

14.58 18.22 B: private school and public school kids did something with books i don't really remember 

18.63 19.59 A: (( do what )) 

19.62 23.03 B: (( i don't know i thought she said something about censorship i think it was something about censorship )) 

22.86 24.07 A: temperature 

24.20 25.68 B: censorship 

26.14 27.42 A: friendship you say 

27.68 29.47 B: no censorship you know 

28.79 30.49 A: (( oh censorship )) 

30.26 31.16 B: yeah 

31.21 33.04 A: oh right 

35.04 36.58 A: so what you think about it 

36.92 37.71 B: uh 

38.63 44.57 B: censorship i think that you should have the right to say whatever you want whenever you want as long as you ain't nobody 

44.56 46.81 A: (( yeah basically )) 

45.77 48.40 B: that's the gist of it how you feel about it 

48.31 62.05 A: i think i think you should be able to um say what you want to say also as long as you ain't hurting nobody but i i don't really uh i don't really agree with that censorship stuff because some things you can't even watch on t._v. 

61.92 64.36 A: with the stuff like they censor out 

63.84 65.07 B: yeah 

65.03 66.19 A: (( so that's why )) 

65.59 70.39 B: (( well i i understand that you know you want to keep some things away from kids you know that that part )) 

69.31 71.36 A: yeah but 

72.78 77.46 A: they should be able to watch that channel they shouldn't censor it out for everybody 

78.14 84.63 B: well yeah i guess it is is the parent's responsibility to make sure they they minding what their kids is watching 

84.31 86.12 A: yeah 

84.68 87.48 B: and not every parent is doing that some kids are sneaky 

87.68 88.66 A: uh-huh 

88.56 91.47 B: (( and you're gonna see what you wanna see when you wanna see it so )) 

91.90 93.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

93.33 94.93 B: (( you're gonna do the best you can )) 

94.77 95.46 A: (( oh )) 

95.66 99.62 A: right so that's all that was about censorship 

99.53 106.77 B: i think they had something i i heard private schools and public schools and how i think she said something about books 

107.32 110.41 B: and censoring books 

111.28 115.22 A: [noise] oh i couldn't really her what the thing was saying 

114.41 119.41 B: yeah me neither i i first i heard censorship and then when it came back i heard something 

119.82 121.87 B: kids in public and private schools 

122.12 123.93 B: should have different 

124.05 127.40 B: or something like privileges or something like that i have no idea 

127.50 130.58 A: right so we gotta finish talking about censorship 

129.98 130.82 B: yeah 

131.95 133.07 A: (( um )) 

136.25 138.33 B: i feel i thought about you know 

139.09 141.16 A: uh i can't really hear you 

141.37 146.78 B: (( i said i thought of saying you know do what you want as long as you're not hurting nobody pain )) 

147.74 152.39 B: (( that's that's see that's the beauty of this country you get you know to say what you want freedom of speech )) 

152.37 154.49 A: yeah 

154.06 158.13 B: (( and you know first amendment like make it so you can say what you want when you want )) 

158.97 162.75 B: and a whole lot an awful lot less more than that 

162.69 170.21 A: uh-huh so do you want about um like serious censorship do you think that violates that amendment like with certain censorships 

170.69 179.51 B: well i think you have a responsibility to the public of course as far as you can't just i mean when you're talking amongst your friends that's a different story that's that's you 

180.10 184.95 B: (( out there making world nationwide t._v. concerning )) 

185.61 193.78 B: you images out there you know you gotta that's when you gotta it that's where i believe in censorship when when it's hitting a wider audience than just the people in your in your life 

193.67 195.52 A: yeah 

194.55 199.16 B: you're taking it to a worldwide stance then you know anybody can see it 

199.56 201.52 A: oh right 

201.54 205.98 B: (( but there's gotta be some i believe in policing something you know i believe in you know )) 

206.17 211.83 B: everything's got its place and you talk if you like if you like it's the responsibility of everybody to do 

207.96 209.70 A: yeah 

212.12 216.23 B: you know to play their part and making sure that the right things get passed out 

216.53 217.42 A: uh-huh 

218.40 219.43 B: what about you 

219.57 222.07 A: (( what )) 

221.29 223.22 B: (( how you feel about censorship then )) 

222.92 224.64 A: (( how do i feel about it )) 

224.37 226.74 B: yeah and all that 

226.24 237.60 A: i agree with you on the part when you were saying that um that it should have a certain limit as long as it don't hurt nobody but like for like certain like t._v. shows like how they censor something 

232.47 233.36 B: yeah 

237.53 251.16 A: i know like little kids shouldn't be able to watch but that's the own company's responsibility that they should have to censor it out their mother or parents it's their responsibility not um to don't don't let them watch it basically 

251.37 253.82 A: so i think huh 

251.67 252.67 B: well 

253.57 258.68 B: i mean when there's cable when there's something like cable that that's irresponsible when there's basic television 

258.73 261.76 B: (( you know that's when i think you gotta you know you watch )) 

259.27 261.20 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

262.24 264.74 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

263.51 276.95 B: i mean when it hits like past you know that only the really racy come on well you know like a lot of crap the stuff in the earlier times is for the kids because that's when most kids are waking up people naturally just know that most parents put their kids to bed around about eight nine o'clock and 

268.36 269.53 A: yeah 

276.34 277.27 A: uh-huh 

276.96 280.86 B: that's when they can start showing you know the slightly dirtier stuff i guess 

280.77 281.62 A: yeah 

282.30 288.28 B: (( but you know i guess everything has a a time and a place you know because you don't you don't wanna expose kids to something they're not ready to see )) 

288.42 292.91 B: and you know they they they say that that like they blame that on the reason kids turn out to be you 

293.04 294.91 B: know certain ways or whatever 

295.32 296.54 A: oh okay 

296.71 299.09 A: [noise] i'm with you on that one 

298.66 299.79 B: yeah 

299.28 313.03 A: what about um censorship in books like like sometimes they will have like certain books like it will have curse words in it some like they will have it like edited out like changed the words around you think they should do that 

313.09 315.97 B: well those kind of books i'm assuming they're 

316.06 318.72 B: so i don't know too many you know too many 

318.83 321.10 B: kids books that have curses in them so 

321.57 327.80 B: but i think on what kind of story it is i mean it's just like a novel i've never seen like a novel like a murder mystery novel 

326.96 328.27 A: (( with with curse words in )) 

328.95 329.73 B: (( uh-huh )) 

329.73 331.74 A: (( it oh all right )) 

330.33 332.81 B: they they probably do have it but i've never seen one 

332.58 333.58 A: (( oh okay )) 

332.93 338.98 B: you know but a children's book of course wouldn't have any so you don't have a problem but you know i don't know any adult books that need to be censored except for them 

339.68 342.05 B: (( suburbs they're used to that )) 

341.53 343.37 A: yeah 

342.12 344.30 B: but even like not to read it if 

344.25 345.24 A: uh-huh 

344.50 349.57 B: it has curse words i mean unless it's like an autobiography or something like that 

349.19 351.04 A: yeah 

350.08 355.50 B: i yeah that's that's because it's your words your life and you can pretty much say what you want to convey 

355.46 357.34 A: yeah 

355.55 358.46 B: (( the experience the emotion behind the experience you know what i mean )) 

358.25 359.93 A: yeah 

358.85 365.29 B: (( that's your right but it's just it's just you've got it's gotta be for the right reasons you can't just be doing it to do it )) 

365.63 368.10 B: (( but i never i haven't seen too many books with it )) 

368.06 371.75 A: no yeah not like kids books i haven't 

370.73 372.68 B: no no of course not no 

373.67 382.39 B: but i've seen certainly some you know magazines and they have some interviews maybe have them you know they curse a little and i do know kids who would read books like that that's like 

382.68 387.01 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

382.77 384.51 B: that would be a little bit 

384.87 398.39 B: off to me like i i believe that cursing in magazine stuff just probably started and they do it every once in a while and only when they're interviewing somebody you know that person because the person being interviewed may have cursed in the interview so they 

393.19 394.13 A: oh 

396.40 398.09 A: yeah 

398.41 399.42 B: they print it 

399.42 400.33 A: uh-huh 

400.73 402.69 B: (( you know what i'm saying but )) 

403.23 405.36 B: other than that 

406.47 410.23 A: (( yeah so what else )) 

410.66 415.60 B: well as far as public and private schools then i i don't like private 

415.64 416.26 B: (( schools )) 

417.65 419.41 A: public and private schools 

418.26 421.19 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

420.17 421.59 A: like what 

422.26 424.48 B: i guess the difference in education 

425.90 426.64 A: (( mhm )) 

426.81 429.67 A: like what would they censor in public and private schools 

429.27 434.64 B: i have no i i guess you know private schools are aren't they a little bit like catholic schools with the nuns and stuff 

434.30 435.28 A: uh-huh 

435.56 437.04 A: (( oh oh oh )) 

436.15 441.68 B: and so i mean catholic schools are really strict those are the ones you're gotta wear private schools you gotta wear uniforms 

442.15 449.55 B: and some public schools you're actually allowed to wear your own clothes but they're trying to change that rule now i believe and the rules are different because 

447.55 448.40 A: (( yeah do )) 

450.15 451.30 B: (( private schools )) 

451.41 457.93 B: have tend to have more privileges that public school kids because the private yeah it's a privately funded school 

454.43 455.46 A: you think 

458.05 459.97 A: oh all right 

458.93 467.83 B: you know the parents the government's not chipping in so the parents are the parents pay the tuition which keeps the school open so they get to they get to have more of a say 

467.88 479.25 B: you know there's no debating with the government or you know school councilmen to get more books or anything you can just you know they they hold a meeting with the parents and so you're willing to shell out more money 

476.97 478.23 A: uh-huh 

479.33 480.28 B: (( to )) 

480.30 487.29 B: to pay for you know the better education the newer books the more advanced books the more advanced tests the more advanced teachers 

487.52 488.74 A: (( oh okay )) 

488.58 492.42 B: and that's how they get ahead usually but i don't think it's 

492.64 496.81 B: (( it's wrong because more money goes to private schools than it does to public schools which is why )) 

497.41 500.83 B: you know half the public schools in new york are closing down 

500.97 502.55 A: yeah 

501.20 506.00 B: (( as it is or the graduation rate is low the tests scores is low )) 

506.19 507.41 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

507.20 510.28 B: because when the government's involved it tends to get a little bit you know 

510.88 514.28 B: they're expendable when the government's involved they are more important things in their 

514.68 515.39 A: yeah 

515.73 518.22 B: mind how you feel about that 

517.72 519.73 A: what 

518.96 521.00 B: the difference between public schools and private schools 

521.13 525.88 A: [mn] i think i think it's wrong too that um 

526.10 528.99 A: private schools get more money um 

528.95 542.74 A: than um public schools but in a way i don't because it's not really that the government's paying for it the parents is doing it basically if they really want to put their money into it to um get whatever they want for their child that's them s- 

536.83 537.67 B: yeah 

542.56 548.21 A: can't really blame them on that part but i think public schools should get money more money than private schools though 

544.19 545.17 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

547.60 550.31 B: i think they should at least get the same at least the same 

550.17 552.02 A: yeah 

550.47 554.17 B: but you know there's more rich kids go to private schools than 

554.31 555.33 A: yeah 

555.02 562.28 B: anybody else because the tuition's high and they gotta be high to afford to pay for all the stuff they gonna need to help advance them 

562.27 564.16 A: yeah 

563.55 567.86 B: and there's a lot you know it's a lot safer apparently a private schools a lot safer than a public school 

568.34 571.44 A: but it's also more in a public than a private 

568.62 569.38 B: (( what do )) 

571.29 572.13 B: you mean 

572.15 574.39 A: like there's also more students 

574.95 576.16 B: in a public school 

575.99 578.22 A: yeah in a public school than a private school 

578.84 583.65 B: (( yeah there are because private some private schools are more expensive so it's just simpler to send your kids )) 

583.67 585.27 B: [mn] to school for free 

585.37 589.57 B: where all you have to pay for is occasionally the occasional class trip and the clothes 

589.62 590.96 A: oh right yeah 

590.06 592.47 B: (( than shelling out twenty thousand dollars a year )) 

592.75 599.31 B: you know and usually they only accept the really you know the real smart kids i mean usually that's the way it goes that's why they get in 

599.31 599.95 A: (( oh ))
