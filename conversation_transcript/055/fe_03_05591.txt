33.07 41.14 A: yeah [noise] a little bit [laughter] um [noise] i don't know have you have you made any changes to your life [noise] due to september eleventh 

40.73 47.65 B: oh absolutely absolutely yeah um generally in the in the area of travel 

41.91 42.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

43.60 44.71 A: really 

47.77 59.33 B: um my wife and i are retired and we traveled a lot [noise] all over the world and uh things were not all that great before sem- december eleventh or september eleventh and uh 

47.90 48.85 A: uh-huh 

51.78 53.17 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

59.58 62.71 B: uh we see a a real difference now 

63.34 64.43 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

63.74 73.71 B: uh we also live in florida in the winter and and it's hurt our economy tremendously down there because people just are not travelling like they used to 

73.83 75.31 A: yeah i'm sure 

74.70 76.15 B: and uh 

76.28 83.91 B: i i think uh a lot of people have changed in their lives or you know whether very large or very small 

83.79 84.74 A: (( mhm )) 

84.80 91.16 A: a- are you are you int- you were in did you intentionally cut down the amount of travelling you did 

90.54 103.93 B: i think we did based on the fact uh that there was so air transportation you know and and uh some much vulnerability i.e. you're on a cruise ship with about two thousand more people out in the middle of the ocean 

92.20 94.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

103.94 105.12 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

104.35 113.76 B: you know uh [mn] not a lot anybody can do but most- but mostly it's the helplessness you know uh uh we didn't let it change our lives 

107.47 109.29 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

113.98 124.27 B: uh you know uh i i know this may sound very corny but i spent uh over forty years with the military and i'm just not about to let 

125.12 128.46 B: terrorists change my lifestyle that much you know 

128.47 129.74 B: but you 

128.63 130.88 A: yeah i don't think that's that's corny at all 

130.39 133.80 B: uh but you just have to be so much more diligent you know 

133.83 136.75 B: and be aware of what's happening around you 

136.79 140.19 B: and um don't act like a victim you know 

140.16 141.14 A: uh-huh 

140.43 142.63 B: that's that's my feeling 

142.91 146.69 A: did it uh did it affect you at at home at all i mean uh in michigan 

147.17 155.92 B: oh i i don't know i think uh there again michigan and florida's about the same we're we're a vacation spot for summer travellers 

155.71 156.83 A: right 

155.99 162.50 B: as florida is for winter uh snowbirds you know and and yes it has hurt us tremendously up here 

162.67 163.95 B: um 

162.96 163.80 A: huh 

164.82 167.78 B: uh don't you feel new new york has changed 

167.81 169.57 A: oh dramatically 

169.70 175.42 A: um yeah for a lot of the same reasons you mentioned and i mean it seems like one of the main reasons is 

175.62 179.96 A: is a lack of tourism here and that's that's really hurting the economy a lot 

179.55 181.23 B: that's right 

180.85 181.95 A: um 

181.40 190.19 B: i think it might even be more than that because uh uh the vulnerability of living in a large metropolitan area 

189.77 190.93 A: yeah 

190.06 196.53 B: you know i i had lots of this for many years with the algerians and in france 

196.49 206.75 B: and the attacks on american's interests uh you know primarily in the middle east and knowing that there's literally nothing you can do 

196.55 197.48 A: uh-huh 

206.78 211.18 B: especially in a free country where everyone just travels you know 

211.67 218.40 B: uh freely and and are able to do things that they can't do in other parts of the world you know 

218.37 219.49 A: mhm 

218.47 223.87 B: go in the store and buy things that that you can't in other parts of the world 

224.53 232.94 B: um but i i thought it was well planned out and uh the timing was tremendous and uh for them for them 

232.35 233.80 A: yeah [laughter] 

232.84 243.58 B: for for their cause you know and when i saw that image of the second plane uh hitting the the number two tower and saw that pilot's 

243.98 250.63 B: last minute correction to this flight i you know i i just 

250.96 254.10 B: you know i i was speechless like everyone else was 

254.29 255.34 A: yeah 

255.04 261.66 B: i uh yes it has affected our life it affected you know the way i think and uh 

262.72 272.37 B: um the changes that have been implemented you know within the law enforcement community haven't affected me yet but who knows when they will 

263.41 264.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

272.55 277.53 A: yeah that's uh sounds like it had a pretty profound affect on you 

277.16 282.35 B: uh it really did as i say i was with the military for forty three years 

281.76 285.56 A: were you were you in the mil- military when that happened or were you no 

283.99 288.82 B: no no i had retired uh i've been retired since nineteen ninety 

288.78 289.89 A: uh-huh 

290.46 296.77 A: did you uh i mean did y- you must know some people who are still in the military and they must have reacted pretty strongly to that 

296.17 301.80 B: oh yes absolutely uh and uh yes yes absolutely 

302.20 308.73 B: it affected all their lives but it's brought it's brought the dangers that we used to face home to us 

309.12 313.18 A: yeah um in some ways i think i mean it's 

309.72 310.92 B: (( you know )) 

313.15 325.75 A: i guess it's not positive but if there is a positive to be pulled out of this i mean i think it it it has made us all aware of of how so many people other so many other people all around the world feel 

325.91 340.05 A: you know on a on a daily basis all those people in the middle east or people for example in the military in less stable areas and we're not sort of feeling um threatened like that far more often than than we do 

339.93 343.58 A: and it it definitely i think um 

344.00 349.62 A: helped a lot of people realize you know in a way how how good we have it here 

349.64 354.07 A: um and how safe we are for the most part uh 

353.07 357.97 B: you know i think uh a plus might be that it has brought people together 

357.91 371.14 B: um people that ordinarily didn't think of themselves as as uh patriotic if you will uh seemed to be now you know and and and they seem to be closer together and and uh 

358.20 359.22 A: mhm 

371.62 382.75 B: they seem to appreciate america a little more now than they did before but as i say uh so many people feel very vulnerable um nothing you can do 

376.01 376.95 A: yeah 

382.85 386.08 B: driving down the expressway and a tanker trailer 

386.44 389.86 B: comes up next to you filled with something other than you know 

390.24 395.45 B: harmless oil there's just nothing you can do about something like that 

394.64 396.54 A: that's right 

395.75 398.02 B: just be vigilant and uh 

398.81 400.74 B: like i don't know what else to do 

401.30 403.32 A: yeah it's hard i mean it's 

403.45 410.22 A: it seems like it has to be dealt with in in in so many different ways and it it's not it's not only a matter of 

410.32 421.69 A: um protecting ourselves but it's also a matter of you know i think examining our our our role in world politics and you know what i mean what what exactly 

422.39 429.78 A: caused so many people to to hate us this vehemently that they would you know spend years planning out this 

430.23 432.59 A: so well orchestrated attack 

432.21 434.76 B: well you know we're 

435.03 438.05 B: i i can attest to that first hand we've 

437.98 451.21 B: we've traveled to uh china twice we've been all throughout the far east uh and i did too of course in uniform and we've been to the middle east uh specifically to egypt and israel and morocco 

445.15 446.08 A: right 

451.49 459.59 B: uh spain and and you know there's a lot of people that hated us long before uh nine eleven you 

459.71 460.66 A: yeah 

459.92 466.35 B: know they thought we were arrogant and and uh you know that we tried to push our way of life 

466.42 472.46 B: on everyone and in effect it was true uh based on the folks that i traveled with uh 

469.36 470.33 A: yeah 

472.51 479.23 B: you know i- if that's not the way we do it in america well they're not really interested in how they do it in america 

478.91 480.21 A: [laughter] 

479.37 482.77 B: you know but uh yeah that's that's really true 

482.84 488.01 B: and even today in today's world with uh with iraq and afghanistan 

488.08 496.97 B: and the different views that we're getting we're getting one view at home and uh al jazeera and the other t._v. in in 

497.03 502.17 B: the middle east are giving a totally view to a different audience you know 

501.66 503.32 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

502.73 506.20 B: so uh yeah definitely something to think about 

505.70 520.25 A: yeah i think americans can definitely be pretty myopic about that kind of stuff um and not not really realize that uh people watching al jazeera [noise] i mean i think americans tend to think that um 

521.06 533.39 A: stations like al jazeera or you know other foreign stations um give uh a sort of highly artificial and highly contrived view of life without realizing that i don't know uh um 

533.45 538.30 A: n- national news does does very much the same thing i think 

537.91 539.28 B: well they they're 

539.40 547.54 B: they're showing things that they interpret them differently they're they're the 

547.42 560.85 B: civilians that are getting killed as collateral damage by bombs and everything and and we say to the marines you know that in lebanon that died uh a brutal uh 

551.71 552.63 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

561.03 566.90 B: bastardly attack by a terrorist and cowards and and to them that's not true you know 

566.91 576.56 B: that's not the way they feel they feel that you know this is their land and we're encroaching on their liberties and way of life you know 

576.08 584.42 A: yeah yeah is this uh was this something you would have expected having traveled so widely and been in the military for so long 

584.19 588.66 B: yes it is to that to that extent no 

588.88 599.89 B: but yes it is i i i just thought for years that sooner or later it would it would come to our homeland and uh you know people forget about the achil- 

588.98 590.03 A: right 

590.62 592.00 A: that's interesting
