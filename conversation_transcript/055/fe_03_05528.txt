216.38 217.05 B: (( yeah )) 

217.72 220.53 B: how exciting how many days a week do you do it 

220.43 229.41 A: uh about four days a week and then i try and do about a half an hour of sort of home routine on the my days off when i'm not 

229.71 231.27 A: uh at the studio 

231.00 233.29 B: that is really really cool 

232.84 235.20 A: (( yeah )) 

234.00 236.79 B: i've never done anything like that in my life 

236.15 239.91 A: yeah well it's great fun i recommend that everyone 

240.07 245.19 A: everyone take at least one one dance class once [noise] [laughter] 

244.07 249.67 B: and how did you select mark morris i mean i have sense of how i how i chose the new york sports club 

249.70 252.14 B: you know how did you make the yeah 

250.00 253.29 A: convenience yeah it's nearby 

254.00 256.26 B: and do you work in the brooklyn area too 

256.16 259.81 A: um well i work from home yeah 

257.65 258.55 B: okay 

260.20 269.42 B: well i i i live on the upper west side but i live relatively far away from the gym and so my decision was based on 

260.27 261.31 A: so 

266.24 268.25 A: mhm 

269.90 273.69 B: [mn] the the the ease of of trying to get there 

273.44 274.30 A: (( mm )) 

273.67 284.98 B: and the fact that where i work is in the south bronx so i'm in different places at different times so i selected new york sports club because they had so many different locations 

277.08 278.08 A: okay 

284.51 285.73 A: (( oh okay )) 

285.33 286.98 B: and um 

286.29 291.18 A: so if you're sort of in one part of the city or another you can pop in 

290.56 296.90 B: yeah that's true that's true and also i mean their hours were were you know good for me and everything 

296.36 297.17 A: (( yeah oh )) 

297.18 300.53 A: do they have good uh facilities [lipsmack] 

300.63 303.99 A: uh do they generally have good facilities would you say 

303.29 312.65 B: yeah you know i think they're fine i i don't think they're the cleanest in the world um but but you know i i think they're more than adequate 

307.53 308.48 A: (( uh-huh )) 

312.73 326.54 B: um the the part that amazed me was you know i i think they're relatively expensive for what they have to offer i think sometimes they're too crowded but uh for the most part you know they've got a lot of equipment so i'm able to um 

321.04 322.91 A: (( mhm )) 

326.88 329.52 B: uh pretty much accomplish what i want to 

329.24 334.67 A: mm do you take any classes i know a lot of gyms offer like yoga or 

330.52 331.22 B: (( [noise] )) 

334.55 341.92 B: you know i i i've tried the yoga and i have no clue how to do it so i find that i get really frustrated with it 

334.96 336.00 A: uh 

341.33 342.92 A: [laughter] 

341.93 354.68 B: i'm serious it's it's hard for me so i need someone i need to do it i mean what i really need to do is like do uh what do you call um individual uh training or something like that 

345.03 345.72 A: uh-huh 

353.91 355.85 A: mhm 

354.58 368.88 B: but i have also uh signed up for an individual trainer uh just for for regular uh um [lipsmack] work outs yeah so i've treated myself as kind of a present so i'm doing that b- basically once a week 

362.94 364.78 A: mhm 

368.61 370.26 A: oh that's wonderful 

369.53 371.57 B: that's very cool yeah 

370.84 373.42 A: yeah that's really a good way to sort of 

373.47 376.69 A: keep yourself on top of a routine 

376.19 389.33 B: yeah it's it's just that feels wonderful to me so i did it about a year ago i did you know a number of sessions and then i just signed up for a block of thirty so i'm like uh pushing myself 

379.13 380.81 A: yeah 

386.30 386.96 A: uh-huh 

388.90 390.93 A: mhm 

389.50 394.29 B: you know it's too cool i mean i love the fact that i can leave the gym and just be sore 

394.26 395.20 A: (( mm )) 

394.43 400.29 B: and uh and exhausted and uh and feel as though i've actually accomplished something 

396.64 397.47 A: (( mm )) 

399.65 401.54 A: mhm mhm 

400.49 401.54 B: so

419.34 420.22 A: (( you know )) 

420.34 424.47 A: and uh definitely i think that uh 

424.94 429.50 A: the sort of the routine i mean as far as uh [lipsmack] 

429.51 433.98 A: you know just sort of being active is very very different on the west coast 

433.40 434.83 B: how is that 

434.28 437.51 A: um well you know you tend to be outdoors more 

438.02 440.12 A: [lipsmack] so uh 

440.20 444.86 A: you know fitness i feel like is more a part of 

444.99 446.40 A: um 

446.65 452.22 A: the way people live in california than it is in new york 

452.55 461.37 A: um you know you're always you're always you're just outside you know [mn] more more of the year so i think that fosters 

462.48 469.12 A: um more of a an active kind of kind of a lifestyle 

469.12 475.25 B: [noise] [noise] that's interesting i mean i really don't know i i know that uh i've got a couple of brothers that live out there and

475.60 489.87 B: uh my younger brother who's i'm going out for his wedding actually uh next week um he wasn't doing anything and i think he was so upset when his older brother went out and we were jogging together and he went one lap and i just went for an hour 

483.15 484.06 A: (( mm )) 

489.58 491.96 A: (( [laughter] )) 

489.82 497.55 B: i think it pissed him off so it made him join a gym [laughter] but it was interesting 'cause he he didn't go with people that worked out 

492.81 494.42 A: [laughter] 

497.03 498.02 A: (( mm )) 

497.57 503.62 B: and um and i find that all of my friends here belong to a gym which forced me to join a gym 

503.08 504.21 A: (( mm )) 

503.70 507.66 B: um but i can't speak for the west coast 'cause i've never lived there
