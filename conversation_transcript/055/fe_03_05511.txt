8.92 10.75 A: oh i'm in from michigan 

10.81 13.01 B: michigan i'm down at atlanta 

13.29 14.27 A: (( okay )) 

13.44 15.65 B: (( one of our topics was uh )) 

15.49 17.57 A: it's all about 

17.17 18.49 B: versus uh 

17.98 20.55 A: yeah books being banned and 

19.47 20.44 B: published 

20.71 22.07 A: yeah 

21.66 25.05 B: well what do you think what is your opinion of a private school 

25.36 26.51 A: (( um )) 

25.77 28.11 B: i've i've had children in both of them 

28.38 32.23 A: yeah i'm only twenty but i'm out of high school now so 

32.77 35.49 A: i don't have any experience of private schools 

36.01 37.83 A: i'm only been in public 

38.66 49.82 B: well now i the the experience i've had with the pub- public schools has been very good i went through public schools and i went to high school in the public school system and uh went to a uh state college 

47.11 48.26 A: yeah 

49.83 53.59 B: and my one of my daughters went to a um private school 

53.61 64.09 B: and we were constantly all the time you know badgered you for funds for this funds for that funds for this and then we have our our our period- periodically meetings 

53.73 54.59 A: (( uh-huh )) 

59.94 60.87 A: yeah 

63.97 72.46 B: and they were always showing us from a chart how far ahead of everybody she was in the public school system so after about five years 

72.35 80.24 B: of just you know constantly bleeding you for money my daughter decided she wanted to go to public school because both of her friends in our community was in public school 

80.00 81.11 A: yeah 

80.21 87.64 B: so we were shocked when they had to give her a test and come to find out she was actually a grade below the area that she was in 

87.71 88.44 A: oh 

87.89 99.67 B: she couldn't she couldn't even muster up to the public school system for the fifth grade so they suggested that we instead of letting her struggle put her back in the uh public school at a lower grade and uh 

98.72 100.07 A: yeah 

99.67 110.66 B: you know then you know based on what the school system they were absolutely correct because she had some difficulty with the fourth grade books and she was in the fifth grade in the uh private school 

111.00 113.57 B: but you know i'm kinda biased to uh 

113.60 116.37 B: the uh public school system my wife is a teacher 

116.44 121.35 B: and i do quite a bit of of volunteer work in the education field 

120.78 123.31 A: so do you uh which um 

123.43 127.46 A: teachers do you think are more reliable the private schools or the public 

127.46 140.55 B: well i'm kinda biased toward the public school because you know after all my wife she is a teacher and uh i do a lot of volunteer work in the public school systems and i work with the special needs children quite a bit and uh 

132.47 133.37 A: yeah 

140.58 154.80 B: i guess and it's you know maybe i had a bad experience with this one particular pub- you know private school but my daughter my daughter now she's uh ten years old and she attends public school and uh she has a straight a average 

146.28 147.24 A: yeah 

156.58 158.28 B: and then she'll be in the uh 

158.34 163.89 B: in the fifth grade next year and she's on her way through school with a uh perfect four point oh 

160.29 161.16 A: yeah 

164.23 174.55 B: and she was one of my daughter was one of eighteen students that was selected out of public school system where we're at to represent their county school system in state finals 

164.48 165.48 A: (( yeah )) 

169.10 169.90 A: oh 

174.66 178.58 B: so that's gotta give you a little bit of a you know idea of what your public school systems 

178.59 179.82 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

178.75 179.66 B: are like 

180.26 185.92 B: and then again it goes back to your teachers you know it's my wife hand picks her teachers that makes a difference 

180.31 181.61 A: i can see that 

186.00 190.37 A: yeah definitely so i know like i heard like private schools are 

190.40 196.54 A: i don't know a lot more strict than public but i like more i like a more laid back atmosphere you know 

193.30 194.22 B: well yeah 

197.60 204.72 B: well they are they are now i'll grant you that they are quite a bit more stricter on the dress you know they all want them to wear you know the same type of clothes 

204.75 207.96 B: you know all the males wear you know black pants and white shirts 

208.06 210.27 A: yeah yeah it's 

208.16 209.24 B: (( you know )) 

209.55 218.26 B: we were she was at a uh a baptist school and i thought that they'd they kinda pushed religion a little bit more than what i thought was appropriate 

212.77 213.59 A: (( uh-huh )) 

216.33 217.50 A: yeah 

218.78 224.51 A: yeah it's more fun to just just like have a good time in school not be like controlled by everything 

225.88 227.49 B: but are you in college 

227.34 228.76 A: yeah i'm in college 

228.92 230.82 A: i go i'm a junior now 

232.10 234.20 B: (( and what what do you study )) 

233.81 238.01 A: i'm studying uh film like in movies and television and that sort of stuff 

236.90 237.83 B: okay 

237.94 239.05 B: media huh 

239.07 241.44 A: yep media right 

240.57 247.61 B: that's what my daughter now our school that uh my daughter goes to when we went back to the public versus the private school now 

247.56 257.79 B: the school that my daughter goes to is one of the more high tech schools it's only like five years old it's only like five i say four years this is the fifth year since it was built and uh they have their own t._v. station 

255.58 256.53 A: (( yeah that's )) 

257.85 260.07 B: and it has their own radio station 

258.01 259.39 A: pretty cool 

260.15 261.07 A: yeah 

260.31 273.63 B: which is low power but you can pick it up you know for i guess probably a quarter of a mile on the f._m. channel then they uh they have a t._v. station a closed circuit t._v. station and my daughter she uh she does the announcements and uh she does the weather 

270.08 270.92 A: yeah 

273.60 275.43 B: on the t._v. set 

275.51 283.84 B: and uh you know you could never find this in a in a private in a public school private school i'm sorry in a private school this would never this this would never be available to her 

284.59 289.62 A: yeah because i looked at some private schools they had nothing to do with film or any sort of media 

289.88 297.17 A: it was all the public ones that actually like some stuff about it even my public school i went to for high school had a media class 

297.21 298.59 A: pretty cool 

299.14 307.65 B: but she you know she loves it she's uh she sits up there in front of the camera and she does all the announcements and then uh she does the weather and uh 

307.67 312.94 B: then uh she does some radio she mostly works with the t._v. she prefers the t._v. rather than radio station 

313.22 314.86 A: yeah same here 

313.39 314.29 B: (( you know )) 

315.69 318.48 B: she uh she loves the t._v. actually she's a little camera hog 

318.68 320.48 B: and 

318.77 320.82 A: yeah 

321.74 330.03 B: but i you know as far as i'm sure there's probably some very very very good uh private schools and there's a lot of bad public schools 

327.78 328.76 A: yeah 

329.90 330.94 A: right 

330.08 339.40 B: but the the area that we're in is a more affluent area than the county we were in it's it's we don't have in fact uh our percentage 

339.41 343.92 B: of minority students is only like about probably two point five maybe three percent this year 

343.93 344.82 A: oh 

344.24 348.09 B: and uh we're beginning to uh pick up a lot of hispanic students 

348.14 361.05 B: and my wife my wife she's like me i i took french and my wife also took french and now she has a some hispanic children in her class and which i've traveled enough in uh in the hispanic country of south america and mexico 

348.31 349.34 A: yeah 

361.25 365.26 B: to uh you know you you're gonna pick it up if you travel in those countries 

361.34 362.27 A: yeah 

365.23 379.50 B: and she's had to call me a couple of times in because she couldn't this one little guy he was from guatemala and uh the first day of school and she just could not communicate with him and he was climbing on the desks and so she finally had to call me on the road to get me to talk to him to get him to calm down 

379.69 383.31 B: and uh but you know he's he's progressed he's um you know he speaks you know 

383.33 388.08 B: good english not not perfect english but he speaks enough that he could communicate with the other children 

388.26 391.70 B: and then here again it goes back to your your discussion of uh 

391.75 394.25 B: do you want private school or do you want public school 

394.36 407.27 B: you know if you was in my area i would say yeah definitely you'd want to come to school that my daughter goes to if you were in uh metro atlanta you know as far as the urban i'd say you know you'd probably do a lot better in a private school in that in that city 

407.52 411.15 B: so it's uh you know it's kind of a you have to just look at the situation 

410.98 415.83 A: yeah and all the times of like your background and culture and if you're in religion 

413.51 415.05 B: right mhm 

416.06 427.07 A: that's for if you're in religion i i'd suggest a private school it's definitely for you and if you're if you're like you just want a good education all round well then just go to public 

428.86 429.69 A: (( yeah )) 

429.97 432.14 A: (( that's what i think )) 

431.81 439.35 B: but you know if if i had to do it over again if i had another child which you know i'm i'm a my child was born my last child was born late in life 

439.21 448.64 B: i was like you know like forty eight when she was born and my wife was like thirty nine but if i had another one to start in school you know this this next upcoming year i would put her in public school 

441.80 442.64 A: oh 

448.49 450.22 A: (( yeah i probably )) 

449.15 453.71 B: but then again it's it's it's all back to the culture that we're in your 

453.15 454.49 A: yeah 

453.99 465.72 B: and there that we live in is is a little it's a it was at one time was probably rated one of the most rural areas in the united states but this there are a little piece in the in one of the uh 

462.98 463.85 A: yeah 

465.81 469.40 B: papers in the u._s._a. today about ten years ago 

469.53 477.60 B: and it said that county georgia that we live in said that one that seven out of every ten vehicles registered is a pickup truck 

477.58 479.37 A: mhm 

479.04 484.71 B: and but now that's not our county now it's the seventh fastest growing county in the whole entire country 

484.86 485.93 A: [laughter] 

485.16 497.96 B: when i moved out here and i moved out here in nineteen ninety there was only forty three thousand people in the whole county now there's over a hundred and thirty thousand ten years later thirteen years later there's over a uh a hundred and forty thousand in our county 

491.16 492.03 A: oh 

498.01 498.97 B: so 

499.53 500.40 A: yeah 

499.58 513.09 B: going back to the you know original part you know i would say you know i just have to kind of look at the school talk to the teachers look at the curriculum and and but still they need to be i i personally think that they need to be at some point in their life they need to be 

505.38 506.20 A: (( yeah )) 

513.12 517.02 B: assimilated into the uh public school system for the contact 

517.19 523.36 B: with other children because you're basically in a closed society in a public well when you're in the private school you're in a closed society 

523.07 525.78 A: yeah because you don't get as much exposure to everything 

525.21 532.39 B: and you don't you know you're kind of naive to the situation when like my daughter you know she had she had a little bit of difficulty at the time you know 

532.52 534.63 B: going back into the public school because 

534.73 546.91 B: the kids that go to the private school they know that if they are out of line that they're not gonna put up with it that they'll be suspended you know where in public school they know that there's nothing gonna happen to them and that was probably uh the big thing with her 

541.12 541.84 A: (( yeah )) 

543.93 544.80 A: oh 

547.48 548.38 B: (( and uh )) 

549.83 550.61 A: yeah 

550.05 551.98 B: so what part of michigan are you in 

552.04 560.50 A: i'm in like the mid the mid like area like right in the middle basically [laughter] around like not like two hours from detroit 

560.66 563.17 B: you must live around grand rapids that area 

562.69 564.79 A: yeah i go to college in grand rapids 

564.19 576.63 B: oh do you okay i've been there several times and we used to have a uh used to call on a customer i'm in sales and uh used to have a customer up in grand rapids and i visit there quite a bit in fact i when i was up there i always stayed at a little called wyoming 

565.07 565.95 A: yeah 

566.75 567.55 A: yeah 

576.62 582.67 B: it's it's just just south of uh grand rapids because grand rapids is not one of the better places that you'd want to stay at night 

576.79 577.86 A: oh okay 

582.51 583.42 A: yeah 

583.12 587.41 B: from what i've seen now this has been you know this has been fifteen years ago we don't have a customer anymore 

587.49 596.39 B: so i haven't been up there probably i guess i'm gonna say fifteen years but at that that time you know there was uh you know a lot of prostitution and everything going up there on the streets and open 

588.00 588.83 A: [laughter] 

595.65 599.35 A: yeah yeah like in twenty eight street i hear that's pretty bad up there 

598.14 599.95 B: yeah [laughter] yeah
