321.53 327.71 A: so i just and and i think i use that as an excuse for not working out as much as i used to 

327.50 333.39 B: [noise] well that can be a good reason though [laughter] i worked with a guy who just had rotator cuff surgery and uh 

329.09 330.57 A: yeah it is 

333.33 346.30 B: he's gonna be out well he's been out a month and they told him yesterday he's gonna be out another month so he's just now getting uh some range of movement in [noise] in that arm [noise] so it's not a good injury yeah so 

337.59 338.77 A: oh 

344.41 350.01 A: no it's not uh and i think part of mine came from um when i was in college i was in gymnastics

350.18 351.65 B: oh okay 

352.95 355.15 B: wow that's got to be hard on that 

354.64 358.65 A: yeah i think that's what it initially caused [noise] the the damage 

358.29 361.43 B: yeah i can see that 

358.95 365.19 A: and and also i i've had knee surgery a torn uh cartilage 

365.20 368.75 A: so but fortunately my leg doesn't bother me 

368.15 370.42 B: oh that's good yeah 

369.16 374.30 A: but baseball was my sport oh yeah i i thought i was gonna be a baseball player 

371.10 372.36 B: really 

374.65 387.87 A: and and i got involved in theater and the coach had a chance to see me in a play and he said you know you're a good ball player but you're not going pro so i've seen you play i've seen you on stage i think you should stick with it [laughter] 

387.44 391.93 B: [laughter] [laughter] well you got a nice variety of things though 

387.93 390.20 A: [laughter] so

409.05 414.86 A: and you know i get excited when i see them but there's so much dis- -cipline required
