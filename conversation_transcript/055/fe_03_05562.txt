59.23 66.40 B: it keep keeps it for keeps it um strong so i i don't if if i lift something on on a day i haven't exercised i can 

66.55 68.15 B: throw it out a little bit 

67.59 71.51 A: i see did that happen in the past or so- is this like part of a um 

71.75 73.96 A: rehabilitation regimen or 

73.90 81.05 B: kind of like that yeah i was i mean i i regularly experience back pain mostly between my my shoulder blades and so 

81.03 84.76 B: my the chiropractor said do this this this and this 

84.57 97.94 B: and so i've been mai- i've been only doing half of the ones he'd been telling me i think i've forgotten the rest but um i started doing those and while i'm doing those i also do a couple of abdominal exercises just 'cause i want to keep my stomach flat 

97.30 99.13 A: right 

98.02 100.92 B: and um now you you said you do running 

100.85 110.25 A: right i run and i also do abdominal exercises just when i'm watching t._v. i just you know sit on the floor and do abdominal exercises 

109.79 111.24 B: oh cool [noise] 

110.47 117.90 A: it's a way of feeling like i'm not wasting my time while i'm watching t._v. right even though i am but [laughter] 

112.93 114.35 B: [laughter] 

116.96 121.37 B: no well that's i mean yeah tha- that makes and d- do you use use use one of those um 

121.76 123.46 B: the machines that you see 

122.33 134.94 A: like a rowing machine or something i don't i just sit on the ground and do sort of like um crunches and things like that yeah but we do have a machine here but i just don't use it 

129.14 130.27 B: (( oh okay )) 

130.61 132.05 B: now what do you 

134.05 135.24 B: (( oh okay )) 

135.39 143.37 B: now do you do the the crunches where you like turn i mean you angle one elbow into the leg and then the other one 

143.18 144.89 A: right sometimes i mean 

144.85 158.62 A: like i said it's when i'm watching t._v. so [laughter] that often will determine how i'm posit- my body's positioned and so [laughter] usually it's sort of like a cycling exercise where i'm just cycling in the air 

151.35 153.15 B: (( [laughter] okay [laughter] )) 

158.37 159.42 B: (( oh okay )) 

158.41 161.23 A: and it works my upper abdominal muscles 

161.07 162.30 B: (( oh okay )) 

161.82 162.78 A: so 

162.46 163.40 B: okay 

162.95 166.60 A: [lipsmack] but i still fe- i have to say that i still feel 

166.76 169.75 A: like i don't exercise enough but um 

170.29 180.02 A: i don't know maybe that's the culture we live in i you know everything you because while i'm watching t._v. i see these people who just have incredible bodies and so [laughter] 

178.31 179.24 B: yeah 

179.83 188.95 B: well the are the well actually that brings up another point which is that i i exercise to keep my body looking the way i want it to 

180.03 180.93 A: um 

188.63 190.62 A: mhm 

189.23 198.11 B: and um i mean and and feeling the way i want it to i mean especially having having to deal with my back and now what are your motivations for for 

194.45 196.34 A: right 

198.17 210.54 A: yeah that's definitely part of it i mean part of the reason i love running is because at the you know at a either at the beginning of the day or the end of the day um it's a relax- it's part of part of it is relaxation um 

209.63 210.36 B: (( exer- yeah )) 

210.44 224.61 A: i find for me the biggest hurdle is just getting out there and starting but once i'm into it i realize just how much i appreciate how much it calms me down and makes me feel um orientated you know um 

214.46 215.29 B: right 

220.77 221.84 B: oh right 

223.93 225.07 B: yeah 

225.05 232.93 A: [lipsmack] so that's part of my motivation but you know i have to admit that i'm sort of secretly always wishing i had my 

232.85 241.07 A: the body i had when i was you know nineteen twenty years old [laughter] and and kicking myself for ever letting that go but [lipsmack] 

235.41 238.36 B: (( mm )) 

241.11 249.37 A: you know um so that's yeah that's definitely a a large aspect of what motivates me to um 

250.47 260.25 A: to exercise is how i see myself but also how other people see me i mean i guess that's kinda shallow to admit but i think it's important you know 

250.86 253.14 B: (( mm )) 

258.64 260.01 B: (( uh-huh mhm yeah yep )) 

260.49 265.32 A: um luckily i've never had like a health problem so um 

265.38 268.85 A: the i would say that that's not a motivating factor 

268.45 269.56 B: oh that's good 

268.88 272.85 A: although i mean i do want to be healthy but um 

271.33 272.27 B: yeah 

274.31 288.37 B: but if you have i mean i i realizing if i have good habits early on i'm going to prevent having like really catastro- health catastrophes later i mean like not being able to lift things stuff like that mm 

274.38 275.25 A: so 

285.10 289.94 A: right no i mean yeah and as i get older and older and um 

289.95 303.30 A: you know seeing what my now that my parents are getting older too i do recognize the value of having a a regular regimen um that's something that is always in the back of my mind i got to i have to admit 

302.81 308.39 B: mm ha- have you seen your parents have any sort of health health issues related to this sort of thing 

306.84 311.77 A: uh yeah recently my mom had cancer so it just seeing her um 

312.53 314.86 A: i i mean it wasn't related to her 

314.99 321.21 A: you know to the fact that she wasn't exercising it was but more i think that um 

315.89 316.78 B: exerci- 

317.72 318.76 B: (( oh okay )) 

322.00 330.74 A: i just think if you are healthy and you have a daily regimen you're more prepared to to meet that kind of uh 

331.87 334.60 A: [sigh] issue you know um 

332.78 333.70 B: right 

334.64 349.46 A: but and it it and that's also related to uh diet and stuff like that which is something that i'm also trying to change you know as i'm getting older i realize i can't eat doritos all the time and stuff like that 

343.04 344.34 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

347.72 348.68 B: (( yeah )) 

349.31 358.01 B: it does i mean changing any of those things i mean i it took when when i was chang- in college i was gradually getting rid of refined sugar 

358.00 359.70 A: right 

358.11 361.36 B: and oh that took such a long time 

360.91 362.26 A: yeah 

361.67 367.01 B: i mean even today i had like a whole reese's peanut butter cup but and i re- instantly regretted it 

365.44 369.29 A: [laughter] sometimes it's okay though right 'cause 

368.33 370.06 B: yeah yeah 

369.70 383.88 A: and i do- i don't know what you do for a living but i am a stud- i'm a graduate student and that's a big problem for me with exercising because when things get you know things pile on and you just finding the time to exercise and it always feels to me that 

374.92 375.61 B: (( oh )) 

383.88 388.57 A: exercise is at priority wise is something that can go 

388.36 389.19 B: yeah 

388.52 393.01 A: and then i always regret it when i let that go because i do like it does 

391.12 391.72 B: yeah 

392.88 405.59 A: reorientate me to and and makes me feel like i can face the day in a better mental state but you know finding the time i think that's the one big obstacle for people to um 

398.24 399.09 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

405.84 412.35 A: to get a daily routine and so yourself we- well like when you were in school did you find that that was a pressure or 

410.60 411.47 B: well 

412.03 415.66 B: i'm in i'm a grad student too and um i 

415.86 425.82 B: at least i i know i'm supposed to do it twice a day i only do this stuff once a day um except for the you know the the bicycling i have to do when i have to get groceries and whatever 

425.48 427.25 A: right 

425.79 428.08 B: um but i earmarked 

428.06 433.10 B: ninety mi- it takes me i decided it takes me ninety minutes to get out of bed 

432.94 443.97 B: and be ready to go out the door and included in those ninety minutes you know the meal and the getting read- you know getting dressed and stuff and included in those ninety minutes are is time for those back exercises 

439.40 441.22 A: mhm 

443.78 445.81 A: right 

444.65 448.54 B: so i've just i mean i know i'm going to have to tomorrow morning i have to be 

448.56 452.38 B: someplace at ten i have to leave at nine thirty that means i have to get up at eight 

452.59 461.27 A: wow i have to admit you sound like you're a lot more i don't for me little things pop up and then that sort of will get me all [mn] 

457.81 461.15 B: (( mm )) 

461.29 463.96 A: discombobulated and stuff so 

463.84 467.49 B: oh well do you do you do running late in the day or early in the day hm when it was earlier in the day it was just cooler mhm right so 

464.11 465.67 A: but 

467.01 473.20 A: um i vary i try to do it early in the day but if i don't do it early in the day then i try to do it later in the day 

472.88 473.91 B: ((  )) 

473.39 474.29 A: um 

474.33 478.23 A: where i went to school was at chicago so i could jog along the lake 

478.54 480.15 A: (( and it mhm )) 

479.75 481.86 B: (( um )) 

480.32 491.09 A: to do it there and there weren't as many people so that's why i tried to to do it there and i just recently moved to new york and mhm uh-oh [laughter] and it right before i'm supposed to 

483.48 484.47 B: ((  )) 

488.53 489.31 B: (( you're talking about )) 

491.32 492.47 A: (( babysit for )) 

492.82 494.64 A: (( for twin toddlers you )) 

495.24 496.13 A: (( know )) 

496.21 504.54 B: um earlier yeah the other thing that i had that sort of pushed me in into a regular schedule was i actually it was last year i was i was 

497.24 498.76 A: (( and )) 

504.58 514.18 B: uh babysitting across town and i took my bike on the on the bus and i was lifting my bicycle off the bus rack and my back went out 

513.11 514.57 A: (( oh )) 

516.30 527.53 B: and yeah i'm run after them so and that was one morning i didn't do my exercises 'cause i was running late and so from then on it was like ninety minutes gotta do it ninety minutes 

517.58 518.55 A: (( no )) 

527.56 535.95 A: oh so that that sort of traumatic experience [laughter] serves as another motivating factor that 

527.58 528.45 B: so 

530.21 533.04 B: [laughter] yeah 'cause i was 

534.85 544.41 B: yeah 'cause i was i was chasing after these kids walking like quasimodo i mean i mean he i mean he had to have me there 'cause he needed me there and i had to stay there 'cause he needed me 

538.54 541.28 A: right [laughter] 

544.04 550.24 A: right so it's the pain the memory of chasing two toddlers around and the pain 

544.71 546.25 B: so it it 

547.06 548.36 B: [laughter] 

549.16 552.46 B: [laughter] yes very active little girls 

551.97 553.92 A: (( yeah )) 

554.41 559.32 B: so yeah that's been it's been worthwhile i mean because i feel like i 

559.71 569.63 B: i o- i i mean when i was in i lived used to live in west hollywood and that's the the mecca for guys who are well built and when i was there uh 

566.49 568.79 A: yeah right 

569.70 578.58 B: i got to s- i didn't get to see what the average man man build was like but now not living there and being away from that community i 

573.53 575.36 A: right 

578.39 588.17 B: get to see a lot more of the average person and i see well i'm in a lot better shape for somebody my age than than anybody else my age so it it that helps 

584.76 587.02 A: right 

587.87 599.89 A: yeah and i think the that earlier when i was saying that i mean i can't imagine living in west hollywood for precisely that reason because i think that there is a lot of societal pressure that your body has to look 

588.52 589.55 B: helps a lot 

598.97 599.89 B: (( mm ))
