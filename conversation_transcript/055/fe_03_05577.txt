38.88 43.30 A: or anything like that but um sort of i think like everybody else it did s- you know 

43.56 53.43 A: open my eyes to the reality of the situation a little more so i think i've i'd say that the ma- major thing i've done is become a little bit more proactive as far as um you know my ph- 

53.75 54.61 A: my 

54.67 60.11 A: ph- philosophies or ah you know beliefs as far as our ah f- foreign policy and that sorta thing goes

72.07 80.40 A: so that that'd be the only thing is that i'm i i try to you know try to be a little bit more of [mn] y- ah y- you know involved i'd say 

72.28 73.48 B: (( yeah m- ))

112.97 118.32 B: oh well yet another disaster to con- it's it's not 

115.95 126.96 A: yeah i guess i those ah those the the bridge there was one of the they say or they were saying it was one of the s- ah things they thought may be targeted right afterwards right some of the bridges up there 

125.37 126.34 B: um 

126.48 133.65 B: yeah they've they- they've thought the ah san franci- the golden gate bridge was a target they thought the o- um [lipsmack] 

133.71 136.61 B: um the bay bridge was a target 

137.08 143.56 A: [noise] so did that did that affect you at that part at that time did you try to avoid those areas or do you generally not go

143.92 145.93 B: no i b- it 

146.14 149.97 B: it's one of those things where i guess 

150.35 157.69 B: ah the fact that i kind of i grew up during the sixties ah and um 

158.39 168.95 B: have grow- have never really trusted my [laughter] government [laughter] ah that i've just i've never really

178.02 179.38 B: a ah 

179.85 184.50 B: um significant amount of um 

185.39 189.98 B: believability in what they'd been saying about it 

188.43 202.51 A: right right okay well we're on the same page for that [laughter] anyway i think we're you know we'll try to stick to the topic but you know and i i i i agree with that you know it was with a lot of the lot of the propaganda they were putting out like ah f- for instance the you know 

193.92 195.73 B: yeah 

203.46 208.19 A: oh [laughter] the anthra- the anthrax and things like that that that 

204.09 205.23 B: (( yeah it was )) 

207.45 215.64 B: what was the it was interesting finding out that the ah government has had has just admitted that um they used a 

215.67 221.79 B: one of one of their supporting documents that they used to convince people that we needed to go into iraq 

221.74 223.46 A: right 

221.86 227.68 B: um they knew was a forgery at the time that they used it as backing evidence 

226.03 227.11 A: oh of course 

227.43 237.39 A: [laughter] really i didn't i didn't hear that news but it's it's no surprise to me i mean it's ah it's really a surprise to me actually that they haven't come out with more ah you know bogus 

237.24 244.69 A: evidence to support basically you know our our you know aggressions basically since since that time you know and it o- one 

244.76 248.39 A: (( one many many things that you know that basically there is you know )) 

248.50 257.94 A: s- s- they were trumpeting t- t- to to you know to back up whatever their actions or our actions i should [laughter] say their you know i'm an american too [laughter] um 

257.94 270.86 A: it w- you know it physically never f- sh- came to pass after we've you know f- ha- gone and done all these other things it's a it's sort of when you think back to the things that were said and it's like really da- da- da- how come s- you know at this point we still haven't been able to come up with things 

270.71 278.04 A: but ah it j- you ch- y- it just sorta sticks to the topic too 'cause it's like yeah ba- ah y- you know it reminds me too 'cause i i i do a lot of ah 

278.12 291.59 A: ah or i wa- ah especially at the time i was doing a lot of ah shipping ah to various you know around the united states and the world for on on ah on the computer on ebay so it would be with the anthrax that did have a ah have some affect on me you know 

284.95 286.81 B: mhm 

287.39 289.08 B: yeah 

291.89 299.39 A: but it you know it still i mean i wasn't worried about getting a package or anything but it y- as far as changes i had to m- you know i sorta did have to make sure i y- t- 

300.50 305.54 A: you know i was careful the way i sent packages and ah how they're marked and all that sorta thing 

305.32 307.07 B: yeah 

305.55 307.24 A: (( ah you know [laughter] )) 

307.46 308.39 A: but it 

307.68 314.10 B: well if you were sending them the right way beforehand you didn't really have to make any changes that it was 

311.71 317.99 A: right right but just to just to ensure you know 'cause i knew the people the the post office people were gonna be a little n- nervous and things like that 

317.86 321.76 B: yeah that that's a safe way [laughter] of putting it yeah 

318.17 319.76 A: but 

320.87 328.13 A: yeah but it's ah yeah other than that i ca- can't say there's there's been any ma- really major changes you know it's ah i'm not sure whe- 

328.40 338.65 A: you know what people could do really un- unless you're are what you would have to do unless you were ah you know traveling a lot and things like that then i'm sure you ah sort of you know 

338.72 341.68 A: cha- you know you got to change the way y- 

342.11 344.91 A: y- you did business a lot yeah

372.29 374.91 B: yeah stuff they can't talk about 

372.73 377.46 A: yeah it's sc- scary i'm su- i'm sure it's probably scary for them to see what's [laughter] going on you know 

377.80 388.14 B: yeah and the the stuff that the stuff that um ah they weren't allowed to report and ah or if they did 

378.42 381.23 A: first hand as far as like the 

384.91 386.71 A: oh yeah 

388.35 398.14 B: um then they wouldn't get allowed to be back in the area while the um in any of the areas the ah military controlled 

394.23 395.34 A: right 

397.89 408.34 A: right yeah i j- just watched actually the the the um a movie i guess ah based on true story of a about the c- ah was it c._n._n. news group what's it called ah 

408.61 411.29 A: (( [lipsmack] ah something about baghdad ah )) 

412.11 426.71 A: but ah just it's all about how it's basically you know how c._n._n. was able to you know get the first scoop and all this sorta thing and how the pro- producer went about doing that and [laughter] sort of like the hurdles and the hoops he had to jump through and ah to make sure that he ah 

418.70 420.56 B: yeah 

426.71 438.46 A: maintained the contacts to be able to stay there and y- you know work with you know don't say the wrong things and but you know but still trying to you know do their job basically to report what's the reality really going on there you know 

438.15 439.88 B: yeah 

439.28 440.18 A: so 

440.64 447.55 A: yeah other than that it's ah you know i don't really um f- you know look at people differently or anything like that um 

447.85 452.58 A: m- with the work that i do is kind of affected by tourism so when it when it happened ah 

452.63 467.60 A: you know that that worried me a l- a lot because there's you know s- s- it's you know people stop coming to s- i i live in l._a. and i work at on hollywood boulevard which is you know s- m- m- the job i do is like s- you know solely dependent on on the tourists coming in t- you know 

462.19 463.11 B: (( ah )) 

467.63 475.93 A: f- to give me their [laughter] money so you know that sort of thing is it irritates me even more you know when the gover- with the p- you know government propaganda and the you know

488.96 490.67 B: [sigh] 

495.87 505.54 A: i guess i you know you were a little more careful or you know you just kinda watching the you know sort of a little f- people a little bit more if something really really weird 

503.00 507.56 B: i'm watching the government a little ah more d- i'm not watching the people the 

506.84 510.96 A: that's true well that's good i mean that's good i mean it there's a lotta people i talk to seem to ah a- 

510.86 520.70 A: a- a- you know you're when you watch the s- the mass media that's it it is just always shocked me like basically the the massive support and everything that bush is getting and just 

520.48 531.10 A: short during you know during the at the aftermath of that and now you know of course there's a people are gonna pull together and things like that that's that's good a good thing but as far as just the you know c- using that t- ah 

531.25 534.15 A: [sigh] patriotism to you know 

533.83 537.91 B: the yeah wrapping themselves in a flag it's 

534.46 535.21 A: to r- 

536.98 546.96 A: it's just to blindly basically you know say you know yes we're g- you know we should go do this and that and you know [laughter] it's s- s- s- yeah i- i- i- it shocked me 

544.86 551.28 B: yes our governor our government knows best support our government if you're not don't support the government you're anti american 

548.46 557.26 A: right an- an- and ah just the the over the overwhelming support you know i couldn't believe like you know it really frustrated me ah s- frish- frustrated me at that time i sort of you know almost lost it 

557.05 565.14 A: [laughter] you know p- with everybody walking around had such massive support and i'd give you know didn't seem like anybody r- could see basically y- you know what's going on 

565.13 575.96 A: you know that bas- to to turn around and then then this try to to take over a country if if ah over there you know and that immediate area ah did the same thing basically that that you know 

576.18 584.86 A: if if there if it's true basically that these terrorists are you know if ah if all that that that we've learned is true about it the ah you know 

584.70 598.58 A: stat- osama bin laden and everything then the last thing we should do is is is exactly what they're saying they attacked us for you know what i mean go go over there and push our weight around again and take over a country and install a government it's like that's exactly why they did it if you wanna prevent a thing in the future you don't go do the exact same thing you know 

590.25 591.99 B: (( [noise] yeah ))
