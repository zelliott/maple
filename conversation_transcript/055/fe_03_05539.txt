83.51 84.39 A: mhm

93.27 102.63 A: right yeah so you just got it there though well um i've wanted to start getting into uh doing more like weight training and weight lifting and stuff like that but i'm not really sure

112.93 113.88 B: um 

114.23 122.43 B: yeah actually i um there's this i tried this new stuff called i do a lot of supplements and 'cause i need all the help i can get [laughter] 

119.67 120.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

122.55 123.29 A: uh-huh 

122.64 128.45 B: but um but yeah i'm trying to gain muscle mass as well and there's this new stuff called n._o. two 

128.84 135.23 B: and it's produced by um m._r._i. research if you go to uh get n._o. two 

135.30 137.75 B: dot com and the two is just a number two 

137.79 138.61 A: uh-huh 

137.87 142.14 B: it's g. e. t. n. o. and the number two dot com 

142.39 146.22 B: they have come up with this new stuff have you ever heard of creatine 

146.27 148.39 A: yeah 

147.50 153.21 B: this stuff is kind of the next stuff above creatine and you can actually use them in conjunction 

153.26 163.98 B: and what this stuff is supposed to do um it's supposed to open up the blood stream basically to allow your muscles to get all the nutrients that they need 

163.49 164.44 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

163.88 177.17 B: and they talk about this perpetual pump 'cause after you've finished lifting the weights in the gym you feel a little bit your muscles are a little tight and everything supposedly this is supposed to feel that way all the time i haven't really noticed a huge difference 

171.93 172.72 A: yeah 

177.16 177.96 A: uh-huh 

177.33 189.32 B: but i've been on this stuff for a little over a month and i gained uh five pounds last month of uh lean muscle mass yeah it's ex- -spensive but if you go to g._n._c. 

183.02 184.08 A: oh really 

185.25 186.38 A: oh that's cool 

189.81 201.49 B: and you get their gold card they get twenty percent off uh the first week of each month so it gets down to a little reasonable but even then and i just got this stuff in the mail from the website um 

194.93 196.21 A: (( oh yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

200.83 201.67 A: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

201.30 214.72 B: the actually get n._o. two if you buy a hundred and eighty tablets you get ninety free or something like that it comes out all of that and you get this book that kind of goes through and it gives there's some workout routines in there and it talks about nutrition 

206.84 207.75 A: (( oh yeah )) 

214.61 215.46 A: uh-huh 

214.93 222.12 B: and the book kind of a little hypes it kind of hypes the product up a little bit which i wish it wouldn't do because it's 

219.50 220.67 A: well yeah 

222.40 231.75 B: for me it's working quite well but i'm also taking the creatine i've taken this weight gainer powder and i'm taking uh like um protein supplements 

224.88 225.86 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

231.37 233.41 A: (( oh wow you doing a lot a stuff )) 

231.78 238.89 B: so i'm trying to uh increase my calorie intake by thirty three hundred a day which is hard to do 

237.62 238.70 A: (( [noise] [noise] wow )) 

239.04 243.34 A: are you are you normally are you what's your build like 

239.25 240.42 B: and 

242.67 248.58 B: um when i first started i was about one forty five six two so i'm pretty standard 

247.58 248.41 A: okay 

248.54 252.30 A: see i'm like one forty eight five eleven so it's so i'm mhm 

248.77 249.96 B: and 

251.51 261.49 B: oh okay yeah so i mean what i don't i weighed uh probably about a hundred and fifty when i started doing the n._o. two i've been working out pretty seriously since february on a regular basis 

261.34 261.93 A: (( yeah )) 

261.53 265.27 B: so i've gained some weight by myself but i kind of got stuck and then um 

265.38 273.31 B: so when i started the n._o. two i weighed about one fifty and then after the first month i jumped up to one fifty five i'm about one fifty six now 

270.87 274.18 A: (( hm )) 

273.81 279.82 B: so that that's i don't know to me that's pretty impressive i'll have to see how long it keeps going but uh 

278.73 279.67 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

280.25 283.70 B: [lipsmack] but the book is i mean it's free it comes with this uh 

280.65 282.26 A: (( right )) 

283.73 284.79 B: um 

283.91 285.48 A: yeah 

284.82 292.05 B: and like i say it's kind of expensive it's a hundred and eighty plus the ninety free plus shipping and handling and the book and everything was eighty five dollars 

292.04 293.01 A: wow 

292.78 296.86 B: so it's not the cheapest thing on earth but 

295.08 296.32 A: [noise] [laughter] 

296.91 298.86 B: so far it seems to be working 

297.04 297.78 A: yeah 

298.64 300.55 A: yeah you think it 

299.38 300.81 B: but it's very 

301.55 304.17 A: you think it's pretty safe stuff or 

301.65 302.77 B: all right 

304.13 314.62 B: well what it is is nitric oxide which is what your body naturally produces every time you go to lift you know you you take a bicep curl 

314.46 328.27 B: every time you lift like that it's um you your body produces a certain little burst of nitric oxide the nitric oxide this book goes into more detail on exactly what it is but it's kind of like the the precursor to tell your muscle to say hey 

314.71 315.53 A: uh-huh 

320.89 321.75 A: uh-huh 

328.07 340.91 B: you need to get busy and contract and it gets the whole process going well the nitric oxide only lasts for i think it's as the book said i was just reading about it this morning and it said like three to seven seconds and then you're done 

331.63 332.78 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh wow )) 

339.94 340.77 A: uh-huh 

340.88 342.21 A: oh and so this is 

341.09 342.12 B: so the ni- 

342.43 349.30 B: yeah and so there's nitric oxide in it's n._o. two and this nitric oxide is a extended release formula 

349.33 354.29 B: that keep maintains a much higher level of nitric oxide in your muscles 

354.34 355.31 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

354.72 358.54 B: so [lipsmack] um being that it's a natural 

358.83 363.39 B: um i mean your body already produces it i figure it's pretty safe 

361.60 363.32 A: mhm 

363.45 371.22 B: but you know i mean you never know i mean shoot half the foods you eat now you find it it causes cancer ten years down the road so 

363.56 364.53 A: (( yeah that's a )) 

366.43 368.52 A: (( yeah [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

370.22 373.45 A: yeah exactly just wait fifteen years or something like that 

372.56 375.22 B: yeah exactly [sigh] but 

374.05 375.16 A: see what happens 

375.82 381.26 B: but yeah i don't know i've been you know i've been doing it for a little while and and the book is um 

378.79 379.82 A: that's cool 

381.53 387.51 B: it like i said it's a lot of hype and stuff that i don't think you need but they have some the basic stuff in there 

385.08 386.27 A: yeah 

387.43 392.56 A: right so well before you got that stuff though like what kind of what kind of 

387.75 388.99 B: and 

392.60 395.78 A: exercises or what kind of workout were you doing 

395.19 396.31 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

396.56 402.88 B: the the bowflex itself has a pretty comprehensive workout program in it and if you uh 

401.41 402.21 A: yeah 

403.13 416.08 B: [lipsmack] you know you just pick and choose all the different exercises but i would you know pick like [sigh] right now what i'm doing is like one day i'll lift chest and back but i work i try to work opposing muscle groups like this morning i did um 

411.64 412.44 A: mhm 

413.99 414.81 A: okay 

415.97 423.70 B: like arms so i did you know both biceps and triceps and then also my shoulders so i kind of isolate body parts 

421.71 422.47 A: yeah 

424.18 425.57 B: um 

426.09 430.34 B: yeah i'm trying to think i now have a real good book that has um 

427.56 428.77 A: (( [noise] )) 

429.72 431.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] ))

434.74 437.97 B: i wish i could remember that i think it's called um 

438.57 452.89 B: if i could find the book it's around here somewhere that has uh a website that has a lot of um different books in there and the one that i bought off the website was um uh basically how to eat right and um 

452.84 458.19 B: (( that one worked out pretty good and i'm trying to remember where i t- tossed the book [laughter] ))

541.56 543.67 A: pretty authen- yeah there's um 

543.72 550.16 A: there's a a a type of climbing called bouldering where you're not actually climbing up a big cliff or something like that but you're just 

550.27 551.55 A: you're climbing on 

551.65 562.11 A: smaller boulders that may only be like eight or nine feet tall or something like that but it's just really intense sort of technical climbing so you're on these really tiny finger holds 

562.07 567.12 A: you know and you may only move up a total of four feet or something like that but it's all about 

562.59 563.55 B: yeah 

567.26 576.84 A: [lipsmack] sort of the um the technique and really concentrating on like where that foot goes and like where that finger goes you know pulling yourself up so it's it's really kind of 

577.00 584.89 A: slow and sort of labored process but it's pretty inter- interesting it's pretty fun and there's a real communi- 

580.06 581.22 B: yeah 

583.55 585.69 B: (( how long have you been doing that )) 

585.47 595.37 A: um just well i mean i've been climbing in general for probably about a year and a half but i've just moved to the city about a month ago so i've been doing this for about two weeks now so
