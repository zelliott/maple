15.59 16.82 A: um 

17.47 22.87 A: i guess i've never really been one to go to the gym a lot i tried it about a year ago 

23.95 28.23 A: and didn't work out too well i ended up going like once or twice a week 

29.17 34.66 A: yeah i don't know if it's because i don't know how to correctly do the format you know the techniques and everything but [mn] 

34.67 36.50 A: it wasn't much fun 

36.94 38.58 A: without a result 

39.03 43.89 A: but on the other hand i guess i do get my exercise from night clubbing [noise] i 

44.12 47.40 A: do that about three four times a week and [noise] 

47.68 49.98 A: that's very very tiring 

50.56 61.32 A: so before i know it i feel like i already had a work out and on the other hand i i love to uh rollerblade here in the city as often as i can and 

58.82 63.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

62.85 63.88 A: (( uh )) 

66.27 67.04 A: (( like for ))

86.96 91.36 A: [noise] sorry if i seem so noisy i'm on the street here 

91.56 95.12 A: also i i all i do is walk around in the city so 

95.86 100.46 A: worrying about my you know fitness patterns or anything really isn't a big deal 'cause 

100.62 114.89 A: i mean i'm slim as it is but having to worry about it no i don't think so all i do is walk around the city and i don't i don't need to exercise the way i look at it 'cause i do enough walking and dancing 

115.50 120.23 A: but other people i mean everybody's body structures are completely different 

120.64 121.67 A: um 

121.92 124.12 A: i'm not muscular at all 

124.36 126.50 A: i'm more of just the thin kind of guy 

128.04 129.30 A: um 

130.37 133.29 A: is it important to me being muscular 

133.77 135.27 A: (( no )) 

136.31 140.19 A: [noise] of course the image out here in new york yes [noise] 

142.58 145.86 A: this talking for ten minutes is very hard 

146.88 149.24 A: (( what else could i tell you about this )) 

150.70 155.51 A: i met several friends that attend the gym i've gone with them 

152.16 153.04 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

155.37 169.87 A: [noise] um i tried get into it with their routi- routine it's easy for me to stay with somebody in a routine but to do it by myself it's really not pushing anything pushing me i think just because i i'm not really interested in it in the first place 

160.26 161.83 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

170.00 171.00 A: [noise] 

173.86 174.77 A: um 

176.41 177.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

177.36 180.09 A: but then once again if i do something that i enjoy 

180.19 182.24 A: i could do it for hours 

182.92 187.30 A: um like dancing i'd show up to the club you know 

187.85 191.04 A: midnight one o'clock in the morning and i'd dance 'til eight 

188.42 189.44 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] ))

203.23 206.16 B: yeah i was just waiting 'til you were done how are you doing sir 

209.09 213.59 B: no i just i think we're just supposed to talk back and forth and to be honest with you it's how it works so 

213.22 217.14 A: oh my gosh i feel stupid now [laughter] [laughter] 

215.06 226.24 B: that's okay i wasn't sure though and i went and asked my wife 'cause she'd done it already and i wasn't sure if i'm supposed to let you go on and i say whatever's going on after you're done and how it works but she said no we were supposed to converse back and forth i guess so 

225.43 238.66 A: [mn] oh no it's so noisy here walking on the street i i can't yeah i can't hear anything on the other side i just heard static so i didn't know if anything i didn't know what was going on [laughter] 

229.13 231.74 B: oh you're in new york you said 

236.32 241.17 B: yeah my name's mike i'm uh forty five i've live i live in michigan so 

241.51 242.88 B: [noise] and uh 

242.03 242.73 A: [noise] 

243.74 251.65 B: i work for uh budweiser here in town so i uh get plenty of exercise lifting cases of beer every day i work for them five days a week so 

252.50 254.75 B: (( [noise] i get hm )) 

252.71 255.40 A: yeah i guess so having a active job 

255.24 263.08 B: yeah i've got two bad knees though i'm kind of limited as what i can do i had to have both my knees replaced so i can't do what i used i used to like to bowl and uh 

263.07 271.79 B: play basketball and uh jog and stuff like that but those days are over and done with until i uh i'm supposed to get two uh both my knees completely re- uh placed 

271.94 274.20 B: so i'm kind of limited though 

272.47 274.35 A: what how soon 

274.58 278.59 A: how soon is that take about i mean how long has it has it been like that your condition 

278.34 284.77 B: uh a couple of years now i uh i went and had some injections done a while ago to uh 

285.06 289.69 B: i don't have any cartilage on inside of either of my knees so it's just bone scraping bone 

289.72 297.91 B: so it's pretty painful and i wear a brace right now for it and uh so i'm kind of limited as to what i can do but i as i say i do work for them five days a week and uh 

298.13 304.48 B: like my first stop there i had five hundred and some cases i had to put away so that kind of gives me my exercise for the day so 

304.91 316.50 B: so i did but i don't do a whole lot i try and walk a little bit but usually by the time i get out of work my legs hurt so bad i uh i don't to get to walk like i used to so i do uh i go swimming a couple of days a week though if the weather's nice here so 

305.35 306.30 A: wow 

317.19 318.80 B: that's uh 

319.15 331.49 B: that's what i do basically now not like i used to be i remember that in high school a few years back i christ i'd run five miles a night swim a couple of miles a night and those days are kind of over and done with i guess the older we get it's tougher to do anyway so 

331.95 332.96 B: but it uh 

331.98 333.17 A: that's true 

333.32 339.85 B: yeah well we go to the gym the wife and i go to the gym i belong to the uh the y. here in town and we uh 

339.81 350.93 B: we go but it's so hard to do in the summer time it's so damn hot and the last thing you want to do is go work out somewhere and sweat to death any more it's tough i basically paid for a year's membership and i go like uh september through uh 

344.93 347.65 A: (( [laughter] )) 

350.90 365.76 B: april maybe so half the year i don't even use it because as i said it's so ungodly hot it's been almost a hundred degrees through the last week or so it seems like so it's kind of hard to get in the to get in the mood to go and work out when you're sweating just walking around the house here so [noise] 

366.47 367.81 B: so 

366.96 369.99 A: do you like the uh go ahead 

369.50 371.51 B: well sir how long have you been rollerblading then 

371.91 374.93 A: i've been doing it for gosh 

375.63 380.53 A: i think i got my first rollerblades at eighteen oh really and i'm twenty six now so 

380.31 381.50 B: eight years huh 

381.00 382.42 A: almost eight years 

382.13 394.13 B: i'd kill a rollerblade everybody i see going on the street they make it look so damned easy like you're just gliding along and uh i was never i don't know if it's coordinated or what it is i could never ice skate i could never roller skate so i know that sure as hell i can't rollerblade 

393.96 395.78 A: [laughter] 

394.49 403.55 B: though i tried to skate when i was younger and i fell off they told me my knees were too weak every time i try and tighten my skates my knees would bow out and i couldn't stand up on them for some reason so 

403.87 417.45 B: yeah i remember one time my daughter had a uh birthday party at the roller rink and i was kind of walking along the wall and some kids come and knocked me down and shit [laughter] so i never uh never quite got the gist of blading although i would have loved to do it they reckon it's really good exercise 

414.28 415.20 A: [laughter] 

417.45 424.94 B: but um i just don't have the uh i don't think i have the coordination for it if i ever did get on them i probably wouldn't stop until i fell somewhere [laughter] 

424.90 433.81 B: um but it'd take me forever to recuperate so it probably best to uh to stay off the damn things but as i say it looks so damn uh people go we got a rail trail here in town 

425.11 426.70 A: yeah 

433.89 442.16 B: it runs for five or six miles and there's always people out on there and they're just cruising along like you know like people walk they're just blading along i said man it must be nice but uh 

442.91 448.82 B: i don't have the uh the coordination for that i don't think so i don't think my knees could take it anyway so 

448.76 450.92 A: yeah that's that's very true 

451.84 460.00 A: [noise] yeah that there's a type of skating i mean um like the street skating here um a lot of kids do it like in the down town area 

459.41 461.18 B: [noise] oh really 

460.24 463.57 A: uh you know where they grind on you know whatever they can find 

463.35 465.51 B: oh okay yeah 

464.20 475.87 A: i'm not quite into that but i would like to like learn how to do all the tricks and stuff that accompany with that but i'm thinking maybe that i'm getting a little too old for you know [noise] pulling off stunts [laughter] 

469.28 471.16 B: (( yeah they just go through the uh )) 

474.26 486.70 B: yeah they just built uh a park here in town a couple of years ago for the uh skateboarders and the uh skaters and stuff they usually got a bunch of jumps and everything they can do and they got one in bay city here and they got another one in midland that they uh 

486.53 496.99 B: they put together so they're pretty nice keeps the kids out of trouble and stuff so they go there and hang out and i watched 'em on t._v. once when thy were on those x. games and stuff and i think those guys are crazy man i mean there ain't no way in hell 

497.34 501.44 B: that's got to hurt i guess they wear padding and stuff but um i don't know 

500.57 504.03 A: [noise] yeah watching those kids on the x. games is um 

502.46 505.53 B: the yeah it's crazy i don't know how they uh 

504.55 506.30 A: it's incredible 

505.80 513.17 B: yeah [noise] one night they had uh i think the guy fell on his head like three times he just kept getting up and getting up he was trying to do some kind of a somersault on his 

513.38 520.35 B: and he couldn't get around all the time and the one time i see two times he landed which were in the back of his neck or something and i mean that's got to hurt like hell 

520.56 522.36 A: yes definitely 

520.94 525.38 B: but he uh he just got up and kept going for it so i don't know 

525.61 526.93 B: but uh 

527.12 530.98 A: yeah it takes a lot of guts to keep trying and trying it's determination [noise] 

530.62 539.99 B: well yeah so you find that your exercise your fitness thing is getting longer as you get older or is it you're doing less and less as you get older by chance 

540.37 544.03 A: um gosh you know i think 

544.49 548.12 A: uh i used to be a real big club kid when i was younger and now it's 

548.42 553.39 A: it's definitely curtailed but i still do it you know do ext- obscene amounts 

553.81 559.52 A: i'm not not as keen as i used to be but yeah i guess the older i get the the less i do 

560.45 565.06 A: and uh you got to watch i mean you have to watch 

565.23 569.84 A: you know your diet as well if you want to stay slim [laughter] 

568.27 571.26 B: yeah that's hard to do too the 

569.86 572.39 A: so you you can't eat the way you used to eat 

571.80 582.08 B: oh no 'cause it goes on really fast and it comes off really slow i notice so but uh yeah when i worked for budweiser i worked for them for six years up until last year i got pissed off at them i quit 

582.10 593.26 B: and i drew unemployment for alm- for almost a year and then they called me back to work so i'm back to work for them but i notice when i quit last year and didn't do nothing more or less just sat around all summer i put on like fifteen or twenty pounds 

590.70 591.73 A: (( uh-huh )) 

593.56 599.88 B: and i went back to work for them like six weeks ago and since then i've lost probably fifteen of it back already so it must have been
