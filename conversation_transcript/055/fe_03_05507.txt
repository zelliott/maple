1.40 2.44 B: hi 

2.70 5.27 A: um mike i'm ben 

2.76 3.92 B: this is mike 

5.07 5.89 B: ben 

5.92 7.01 A: how are ya 

6.58 8.74 B: good how're you doing tonight 

7.93 9.05 A: good 

9.62 12.28 A: um i guess we're to talk about uh 

12.46 18.71 A: i didn't hear exactly public or private schools have the right to force students to read certain books is that right 

17.58 21.03 B: that's the way i understood it yeah 

19.49 20.49 A: okay 

20.66 22.10 A: well what do you think 

21.50 23.26 B: well uh 

23.66 32.82 B: well i think i think they should actually certain books i think uh they should be able to uh relegate 'em to read 

32.65 33.65 A: uh-huh 

33.19 35.23 B: how about you [laughter] 

34.65 41.51 A: yeah that's that sort of sounds okay i'm not sure exactly what that means force them to read certain books 

41.30 43.41 B: yeah force is a strong word 

43.18 53.84 A: um and i guess that depends on what certain books means i mean i don't know if i'd want i mean there are there are lots of books i would not want um schools teaching children 

51.29 58.45 B: sure sure it well the way i see it the way i think of it is introducing them to different types of literature 

58.40 59.42 A: uh-huh 

59.07 64.65 B: and and uh just opening their eyes to different types as far as even poetry even 

64.67 65.64 B: uh 

65.82 69.63 B: but there's a lot of uh like i i was made to read 

69.88 73.43 B: uh oh what was it called something 

73.46 77.78 B: something with the pigs about little kids on an airplane that crashed on 

76.73 78.56 A: oh lord of the flies 

77.92 90.67 B: lord of the flies a piggy was the character yeah yeah i never would have read that on my own you know but after i had to read it in school i thought yeah it was a pretty good story it makes you think about uh 

78.99 79.93 A: yeah 

80.40 82.53 A: right what a great book 

84.06 85.08 A: uh-huh 

91.28 100.57 B: society and stuff like that even though i guess i was a teenager at the time you know it kind of opens your eyes to things in society there 

95.83 96.77 A: (( mhm )) 

100.74 101.48 B: so 

100.93 107.97 A: uh yeah i think i think that's a great example of like the sort of book that may be controversial but that 

108.49 110.08 A: students should read 

110.53 118.59 B: yeah yeah well i think in today's society there's too much politically correct stuff going on too [laughter] that's my opinion there 

117.14 118.16 A: uh-huh 

118.69 119.65 B: uh 

120.20 124.74 B: it it seems like no matter where you step you're stepping on somebody's toes 

124.91 130.49 A: yeah that's true i mean i think i think it's important to be sensitive to those things but i agree 

129.44 135.41 B: sure there's there's a lot of issues you need to be sensitive to but you can be overly sensitive either 

135.36 141.64 A: yeah i mean yeah there are some some school districts that talk about not reading huckleberry finn for example 

141.26 143.24 B: yeah yeah 

142.10 147.19 A: you know because it 'cause it uses uh it speaks about blacks derogatorily 

147.18 152.23 B: yeah and and but you know what that's part of the history of the country and that's the way it was back then 

152.19 153.71 A: i i think so too 

153.72 156.19 B: yeah and that's that's something they need to be 

156.35 168.74 B: uh they they just need to know about that the way things were then the way things are now what we learn from history uh reading some of the old literature i think introduces a lot of that then they 

163.30 164.95 A: mhm 

167.68 169.87 A: i think you're right yeah go ahead 

169.78 182.68 B: i was going to say then they can see the change that has come across in society uh what's acceptable then and what isn't now and a good way to do that really without hurting feelings is to read it in a book 

182.67 184.46 A: (( mhm )) 

183.49 185.37 B: you know uh that way you 

185.67 189.60 B: you see movies today they still put that stuff in movies and everything 

189.38 190.50 A: mhm 

189.95 197.18 B: so of course that's all uh for profit thing it's not like a public education deal but uh 

195.75 196.85 A: mhm 

197.91 201.83 B: i don't know how do you feel about it [laughter] [laughter] 

199.74 207.58 A: no no that's good i think i think everything you said it's it's pretty right on and i also um yeah i think uh 

207.72 211.48 A: yeah i think you're right i mean i think reading like literature from 

211.51 220.02 A: the past is really important in in a number of ways one like you said i mean it it is it is a part of who we are as a country 

220.25 225.46 B: yeah it's got a lot to do with with uh yeah exactly right who we are 

221.83 225.92 A: (( um )) 

225.48 227.59 B: and where we come from so 

226.98 232.09 A: yeah um and i think it's also important just just for literature's sake 

232.02 236.55 A: i mean if it's if it's a great book and tells a story and uses language in 

236.47 249.55 A: interesting and creative ways i mean that's important too you don't want to censor that so that kids aren't faced with with uh some you know what are what are now un p._c. issues 

246.76 254.99 B: yeah yeah yeah and then and so they won't be afraid to write things on their own to you know in the future if 

255.30 259.71 B: if uh they wanna write uh just just so that they're 

257.13 258.49 A: yeah 

259.76 265.47 B: you know if kids are going through school now they see all this stuff well we can't read this we can't read this 

265.54 272.57 B: it might really lead them down a tunnel if they wanna write so well all i can do it write about one or two things you know 

272.40 273.50 A: yeah 

272.79 279.07 B: uh all the doors are closed for me to make any money if i want to write about something else so 

279.14 282.90 B: but you know there's there's always been controversial books and uh 

283.11 289.47 B: of course you know people used to get blacklisted all the time back in the uh thirties and forties and even fifties 

289.01 290.08 A: right 

289.50 294.23 B: um because of their views in the books they wrote have have you ever heard of johnny got his gun 

293.97 295.76 A: oh sure yeah 

294.55 306.44 B: yeah dalton tremble i think it was yeah he was the oh i think he was long dead before uh he ever got any fame out of it really he was blacklisted and everything so 

303.36 304.46 A: uh-huh 

307.43 317.33 A: yeah that's another great example i think and it's it's interesting actually now you read some of the books now that people were so worried about seventy or eighty years and they seem really tame 

317.69 330.32 B: [mn] yeah that's the truth [laughter] i don't i've never read any like oscar wilde but i understand that his stuff is really really out there in his time the stuff he wrote and i i think he was english or something 

326.39 327.45 A: uh-huh 

330.25 333.62 B: and i believe he was gay but uh 

330.36 331.40 A: uh-huh 

332.56 333.55 A: uh-huh 

333.86 336.00 B: from what i understand he was uh 

336.41 339.64 B: he was pretty risque or something i don't have you ever read any of his stuff 

339.60 341.51 A: uh i haven't actually 

340.67 343.95 B: no i haven't either but i just heard a lot about it and uh 

344.21 348.84 B: i guess uh a lot of people they they weren't allowed to read his books in schools for years 

348.64 349.80 A: right 

349.19 353.34 B: just because not so much what he wrote because who he was too 

353.38 354.78 A: oh right 

354.24 359.76 B: yeah but as far as uh i just think they should be able to uh 

360.38 362.69 B: to have them read i mean 

362.94 368.04 B: somebody's got to draw a line somewhere you know you can't have 'em just 

365.22 366.22 A: (( mhm [cough] )) 

368.36 379.39 B: reading the the pornography material but uh and there's the board of directors or somebody they should have some board that you know draws the line somewhere 

371.33 372.35 A: right 

380.17 383.38 B: but uh and and a lot of schools go 

383.51 389.65 B: used to i don't know anymore they go from year to year to year they each class read the same book you know but you 

388.55 392.44 A: right i think it's still pretty much like that in the school curriculum 

390.69 393.94 B: is it yeah 

393.96 404.20 B: and then i guess if if somebody wants to change a book then they have to have it okayed somewhere uh i don't know what the status i guess they still like my son just read uh 

404.89 407.48 B: uh the count of monte cristo 

407.37 410.65 A: oh wow oh that's a great story that's a great book 

409.35 410.28 B: so 

410.30 417.84 B: well and and that was a school thing there you know they all did that in school and actually i've never read that one [laughter] 

413.45 414.81 A: mhm 

416.96 421.01 A: oh it's really great i i totally recommend it yeah 

419.49 423.83 B: oh really he was telling me about it too so i think well it sound pretty good 

423.27 425.99 A: it's it's really exciting actually for 

426.62 431.53 B: and he just he just turned thirteen so i don't know you know 

426.90 428.45 A: what it is [noise] 

432.05 436.75 B: uh what's in the book and and how it goes for that age and stuff 

436.24 440.84 A: has has has he had to read any controversial books or anything like that in school 

439.83 445.40 B: uh no that's actually his first real like novel i guess you'd say he's had to read 

444.67 446.14 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

445.48 452.85 B: and that was what seventh grade so so he'll be getting more down the road here but 

450.51 451.50 A: uh-huh 

453.01 466.94 B: uh but you know even when i was in school i i wouldn't i didn't have to read a whole lot that's the just the one the one lord of the flies really stands out in my mind [laughter] yeah what about you did they make you read anything like that 

458.06 459.32 A: right 

462.27 464.02 A: yeah totally 

466.43 470.92 A: um yeah some things i remember have you ever seen the movie clockwork orange 

470.49 472.45 B: oh yeah 

471.25 476.04 A: you know that movie i had i had actually my eighth grade teacher showed that to the class 

475.55 477.90 B: oh really in the eighth grade huh 

476.64 483.45 A: got got got in a lot trouble for it 'cause there's there was a rape scene and 

478.20 481.52 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

481.98 485.32 B: yeah that's a pretty serious movie [laughter] 

484.37 496.94 A: he actually a couple of parents called in and complained about that um but i was really i mean i was really it was i mean my parents well i don't know what my parents thought but i i thought it was cool i mean it was really 

488.26 489.90 B: oh yeah 

496.62 500.01 B: kinda opens you eyes doesn't it [laughter] 

497.32 501.30 A: that's right and and i liked the fact that the teacher 

501.34 504.86 A: respected us enough to think that we could we could handle it 

505.25 514.12 B: yeah that's a good way to look at it yeah that's a pretty good way to look at it there hadn't thought about it like that but yeah that's putting a lot of faith in the kids too 

507.87 508.80 A: (( you know )) 

514.14 520.37 A: yeah yeah actually yeah that's maybe that's a way to look at sort of controversial books i mean thinking about it they're 

520.49 523.27 A: taught in the proper ways 

523.55 524.44 A: (( you know they )) 

524.57 526.99 B: yeah i and i think 

524.93 528.60 A: can they can really be be a maturing thing 

528.29 533.52 B: yeah i i i think it's a big step really uh to look things 

533.81 534.84 B: uh 

535.02 541.43 B: 'cause you're going from like potty humor to adult [laughter] and they've gotta make uh 

538.87 540.10 A: right 

541.48 549.70 B: the transfer in there somewhere you know they gotta kinda guide you through it somewhere in there and you know how it is as a teenager you 

546.60 547.68 A: (( mhm )) 

550.15 554.16 B: you make a joke out of anything especially with uh serious 

554.20 555.34 A: right 

554.67 555.67 B: so 

556.01 558.55 B: yeah especially you know they sit down in the class 

558.71 566.10 B: and they talk about each day's like if they had to read a chapter last night then the next day they sit down in class they go over the chapter 

565.99 566.91 A: mhm 

566.18 572.05 B: well why did you think they did that and stuff like that that kind of opens their minds to uh 

573.30 574.57 B: just life 

574.65 576.03 A: mhm 

574.67 585.19 B: you know to think of things you know everybody especially at that age they look at it in probably a pretty similar way you have usually three or four kids that look at things differently but the 

581.50 582.55 A: (( mhm )) 

585.20 598.71 B: rest of the teenagers kinda look at it in the simplest form instead of looking deeper into the story and then the teacher goes over it well here's what's supposed to be going on from the writer's view and all that and then people stop to think about it 

588.74 589.73 A: (( mhm )) 

598.98 599.89 B: (( so )) 

599.04 599.89 A: mhm
