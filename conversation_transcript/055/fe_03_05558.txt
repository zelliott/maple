154.57 157.66 A: uh well we've already covered that yes how about you 

156.62 163.56 B: [laughter] i uh i do inline skating but more for fun than for staying healthy 

163.20 164.20 A: okay 

163.56 174.09 B: and i do it probably about twice a week i think that's not enough to uh i mean if i were eating wrong i don't think that would be enough to counteract the effect 

173.82 184.53 A: okay well the rumors that i've heard are what ever you do you have to do it three times a week minimum and you have to do it for at least twenty minutes vigorously 

174.71 175.74 B: (( so i )) 

184.90 186.00 B: see 

186.06 198.30 B: i usually go out for about an hour an hour and a half but the nature of that activity is that a lot of it is i guess it's kind of like riding a bike a lot of times you're not really doing any work you're more being conveyed by gravity or 

198.06 201.72 A: see with fork lifting you have to do it or it doesn't get there 

201.13 207.84 B: [laughter] unless you lean down [laughter] or used the used 

205.57 206.97 A: well that's it 

207.12 209.56 A: but then you get back exercise you see 

208.85 217.86 B: [laughter] i see [noise] so i'm curious i what what what profession are you in then 

217.36 227.19 A: i am a uh expert witness uh in the area of credit reports and credit damage measurement and i'm in the process of developing a computer 

227.01 234.08 A: modeling program to allow attorneys and accountants and others to do a preliminary 

234.11 237.31 A: uh analysis of whether or not they have a case 

237.36 240.95 A: and i'm looking for a computer programmer to do that for me 

237.43 238.23 B: oh 

240.73 242.03 B: (( i see )) 

242.09 249.91 A: and uh i've already done a lot of the structural work i just need to get the and i've done that in excel [lipsmack] 

249.71 250.80 B: okay 

250.84 252.63 A: and so uh 

252.75 257.13 A: probably in about mm three to five weeks i'll be ready with the 

258.40 261.53 A: version that will be ready to be con- what i call converted 

261.61 262.71 B: okay 

263.29 267.49 B: so you have some sort of a spe- sort of a specification model 

268.30 269.64 A: not really 

268.86 269.56 B: (( don't )) 

270.71 274.09 A: i don't to show you how much i know i don't know what that means 

273.80 279.08 B: [laughter] you mean that you you've uh mocked something up that describes what you need done 

277.74 278.68 A: yes 

278.90 279.74 A: yes 

279.62 281.23 B: yeah okay that's 

280.78 283.09 A: and that's what i've done in excel 

282.49 283.65 B: i see 

283.34 287.56 A: actually i haven't done it i've had somebody else do that [noise] 'cause i don't have the patience to do it 

287.40 291.30 B: yeah that's fine it's just definitely not for everyone it 

290.51 295.84 A: right no i try to stick to what i enjoy and everything else is for everybody else 

295.42 297.73 B: yeah that's fair 

298.38 306.29 A: um let's see so you do inline skating um do you do just regular walking or [noise] 

302.60 303.72 B: yeah 

305.32 312.50 B: i yeah i w- i walk a lot uh a lot of times i go out after work and go for a walk for a couple of hours 

311.87 314.11 A: oh wow that's really good for you 

313.90 316.69 B: uh it's good for thinking uh 

316.09 322.65 A: that's right i used to do that a lot too when i was uh probably around your age i'm i'm almost twice your age 

322.76 329.64 A: and um i used to um be um a lot more vicious than i am now 

329.95 335.59 A: and uh i would work out a lot of those uh feelings by walking and singing 

335.83 337.89 B: [laughter] really 

337.23 344.55 A: and i yes and i walked in areas that were isolated and or deserted which is similar but not the same 

344.49 354.16 A: and um at the end of my forty five minute to to a three hour walk um [noise] i was done and i felt pretty good 

353.64 356.14 B: wow it was good therapy 

356.01 357.93 A: oh it was it was great 

357.20 358.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

358.91 362.25 A: now my exercise is my fingers more than anything else 

362.67 365.41 A: like you i spend a lot of time at the keyboard 

362.88 363.67 B: [laughter] 

364.77 367.82 B: yeah it seems like we're all going in that direction 

367.45 368.72 A: yeah 

368.08 370.66 B: and i mean especially when um 

370.85 378.29 B: when problems tie you to that device you know the more involved in the problem you get the less mobile you can be 

378.02 384.81 A: well that's one of the reasons i got a lap top it's still sitting but i can be out somewhere 

380.67 381.80 B: yeah 

385.06 388.73 A: as opposed to confined to the same space 

388.72 391.32 B: yeah i'm definitely i i've been um 

391.96 401.26 B: incrementally postponing a purchase for about a year now you know always thinking okay wait the one i want isn't out quite yet and then wait another four months 

401.26 412.39 A: well you should wait in almost seven month increments because that's as you probably know better than i do that's the cycle of incremental [noise] or significant electronic improvements 

401.36 402.34 B: (( but um )) 

412.52 420.02 B: yeah it's it's also just hitting a sweet spot of when you happen to have the right amount of cash laying around and and there's one that's right 

418.67 426.03 A: well the heck with all the money we're making from this you ought to be able to buy at least um [lipsmack] i don't know a piece of pie 

425.75 432.96 B: [laughter] well i recently uh bought into a condominium so that's uh sopped up a a whole lot of extra cash 

429.76 430.59 A: uh 

433.76 434.74 B: but uh 

434.04 435.70 A: are you married 

435.27 439.30 B: not yet but i guess pretty much on track to be soon 

439.01 440.02 A: (( good )) 

439.32 442.93 B: i moved in with my girlfriend so this is the first step 

441.54 445.15 A: oh does she do any exercising with you does she go on your walks 

443.80 444.78 B: (( yes she does )) 

444.86 458.22 B: yes she's a big walker um she's she's been on weight watchers for about nine months nine or ten months so um she's trying to incorporate exercise more determinedly into her life at the 

456.95 469.13 A: well one of the things that i have found in terms of weight control which is one of the factors or purposes of exercise is i have found that uh there's a book out there called eating for your blood type 

469.35 470.10 B: okay 

469.39 475.36 A: and it is helped me tremendously i lost almost thirty pounds in something like two and a half weeks 

475.33 486.03 A: no i'm sorry two and a half months um [lipsmack] i and i didn't really change anything i i just stopped eating things that were bad for me or difficult for me to digest 

485.55 486.56 B: uh-huh 

486.16 491.43 A: and uh uh my wife and i are both on it we're feeling much better 

491.20 496.61 B: that's you know i've never heard blood type mentioned as part of the whole fitness equation 

496.22 502.26 A: well um i don't know that it's fitness but it's certainly health it won't make you 

502.29 515.59 A: uh it won't give you increased lung capacity but it will raise your energy level i know it has for me it will raise your uh clarity i used to feel kind of sluggish from time to time 

515.48 524.67 A: and uh most of that's gone away and my wife's diet is totally the opposite of mine we have uh well not totally ninety percent different than mine 

524.65 533.89 A: and we've been able to achieve some of the benefits of exercise simply by removing some of the problems that are caused by eating food that's not good for your body type 

533.55 534.43 B: mm 

534.24 544.83 A: i don't mean tall short thin fat but body types in terms of your uh blood type um there are books in the library and there are books in bookstores that are 

544.78 549.99 A: abbreviated versions that are specific to each blood type do you know your blood type 

549.87 551.71 B: me i don't even know 

551.40 557.25 A: um well you should know because if you ever need a transfusion that's the first thing they want to know if you're 

552.77 553.49 B: didn't 

556.49 558.82 B: of course uh i know it's recorded 

557.75 565.24 A: out there walking or line skating um you get hurt that's the first thing they're going to ask you 

565.58 567.98 B: yeah it's just it's been a while 

566.55 570.06 A: and they might ask your your fiancee girlfriend roommate 

569.89 571.46 B: yeah 

570.94 578.85 A: um i we found it a very interesting exploration of something that i think is uh greatly overlooked 

578.71 579.89 B: huh 

580.01 581.06 B: yeah whole 

580.09 587.18 A: and so uh that's why i'm suggesting it to you as a and i'm sure you can find something about it on um 

587.29 592.31 A: uh on the internet uh blood type diet something like that is what i would look 

591.39 595.31 B: sure yeah i'll share that with her later tonight 

594.08 597.26 A: yeah this uh this book has been out for about fou- 

597.57 599.89 A: eight years now i think and
