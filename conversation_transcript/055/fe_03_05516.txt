133.37 134.96 B: yeah that's right 

136.26 145.15 A: it's a problem i wish there was some way where like i could get my exercise from doing my job rather than have to you know spend money on the gym or spend extra time out of my day 

136.57 137.29 B: (( mm )) 

142.35 143.49 B: yeah

411.54 412.84 B: and 

412.94 426.66 B: i i found out information about it that i've never taken it but i found information that it's it's pretty bad for you it hasn't been proven yet but they're still doing research on it and since it's basically water 

426.91 429.94 B: and if you if you stop using creatine 

430.06 436.25 B: all your everything's gonna go away because everything that you're built with is there's water 

436.40 438.15 A: yeah it's like those um 

439.11 441.78 A: it's like those like diet pills you know like uh 

441.36 442.58 B: yeah 

441.87 447.10 A: they're called like uh trim stock once you stop taking it y- you're gonna gain all the weight back 

446.57 453.18 B: yeah that's that's why i don't take it and the other thing is i don't have enough money to buy that stuff 

453.33 461.06 A: yeah that shit that shit's real expensive like i think people spend so much more money getting fit than they really need to 

460.49 466.38 B: yeah y- have you seen that on the t._v. the hollywood forty eight miracle diet 

466.29 471.18 A: oh yeah yeah that that liquid diet what a load of crap 

467.18 469.75 B: that is so stupid i 

470.89 475.69 B: i would like seriously laugh at those people that actually called you know 

475.71 489.28 A: yeah and the thing is like the f._d._a. doesn't in is for whatever reason they deregulated so that if you're a nutritional supplement that like medicine the f._d._a. can't evaluate what you're saying 

484.28 485.21 B: mhm 

489.23 490.07 B: yeah 

489.61 500.64 A: so they have like they have no no way to like you know the government doesn't check up on their claims to see whether they're you know actually scientifically uh sound or not 

500.02 508.74 B: well yeah [mn] they they trick the people because like they probably put orange juice in it and say well orange juice does give you um 

508.64 515.57 B: if you drink orange juice and exercise regularly they don't say exercise regularly then you'll lose weight 

515.79 519.11 A: yeah yeah that's what they yeah they all have that like saying like 

515.95 516.81 B: but 

518.54 520.56 B: yeah you have to exercise 

519.17 522.70 A: well if you take our stuff and eat less and exercise more then 

521.74 526.47 B: yeah most people just think that you take it and then just sit back and relax 

526.68 529.87 A: like yeah kinda sad people are

530.07 531.57 A: people are easily fooled 

531.67 533.65 B: yeah well i guess 

534.54 536.72 B: they're really desperate i guess 

537.69 541.33 B: i wonder if they've tried just like working out going to the gym
