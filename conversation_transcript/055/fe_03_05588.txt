68.39 82.81 A: so definitely changed uh you know i was like okay nothing's really gonna be the same after this [laughter] that's for sure you know but um were yo- [mn] so you were in the city when it happened even though you were interviewing 

81.75 87.76 B: mhm um i was in the city around that day i stayed home that day actually 

87.19 90.08 A: right right right well so you didn't uh 

89.61 91.34 B: i just missed it 

90.73 93.05 A: yeah it was it was pretty drama- 

92.01 95.35 B: i watched it on the whole thing on television mhm 

94.21 101.23 A: yeah the people the people uh on the streets it was pretty dramatic that's for sure but you know i i mean 

101.25 105.33 A: i don't know as far as things changing for me it was just like 

105.40 111.53 A: you know i don't know when i i guess when i get on the subway now sometimes i get a little bit uh 

111.52 126.35 A: a little bit creeped out by things you know [laughter] i was on i was on the subway the other um [noise] the other day and i was going downtown actually to um chamber street uh on the one and nine line 

113.29 115.13 B: mhm mhm 

126.18 140.82 A: and there was this just one guy and he was on the subway oh he was on a train alone it was a pretty car and the guy had a little video camera in his hand and he was taping as he was videotaping as we were 

140.65 153.02 A: coming into the train stations and as we were leaving the train stations and this got me really really uncomfortable you know uh and that was that was like the weekend right bef- the week right um 

148.20 149.65 B: yeah 

152.87 163.39 A: the couple of days right before fourth of july and there was something where the where they shut down um one of the bridges because there was some suspicious packages or whatever 

162.11 163.20 B: mhm 

163.26 172.31 A: you know and that kinda that kinda freaked me out a little bit i mean it doesn't mean that i don't live my life or whatever but you know it still kinda freaks me out a little bit 

169.53 171.29 B: right 

171.61 172.91 B: (( so are you )) 

173.25 182.61 B: the police officers and national guard in the subway stations now are you reassured by them being there or a bit uneasy about it 

181.97 189.07 A: [noise] i don't know whether it can if if anything happens that's major and dramatic they can really do anything about it [laughter] 

188.34 191.87 B: i don't think they can do anything i think it's for show 

191.34 195.28 A: yeah yeah i mean it's you know if there's a if 

194.49 198.29 B: i suppose they could search someone suspicious but 

197.43 205.51 A: absolutely yeah but how many how many times can you do that i mean it's just too random and it's too much you know to really say 

200.32 202.11 B: right 

205.38 218.40 A: you know okay this is gonna make a a huge difference or whatever but uh you know i guess maybe if there's a deterrent a- as far as if it will be a deterrent it's you know someone 

218.31 228.79 A: is like you know if someone is suspicious and they're they're body gestures and their actions make them you know kinda stand out like a sore thumb 

228.64 229.52 B: right 

228.68 233.73 A: yeah that'll that'll help but i haven't seen one single case of that yet where 

232.54 234.60 B: [noise] no neither have i 

234.01 237.16 A: you know so it's it's just really 

237.17 251.72 A: it's you know at least they're there and it's it is good window dressing i suppose but you know if someone's got you know something in their bag and they've been programmed to do something they're gonna do it [laughter] 

251.24 254.78 B: right and they'll they'll be trying to be inconspicuous 

253.99 265.18 A: yeah yeah i mean you know so again it makes you kinda kinda like you look at you look at people um you know on the subway and you're just like mm okay 

265.01 279.44 A: 'cause i know immediately after nine eleven i was i was the the heightened awareness of uh of people around me on the subway was was a lot was a lot and they only other thing that's different is like if i see 

279.31 282.19 A: um just a random like 

282.54 290.29 A: i don't know package or whatever or something on the street or something to that effect i will get a little bit suspicious you know 

289.38 291.22 B: mhm mhm mhm 

290.14 304.82 A: um because i know tha- that like let's say in israel um if they see a package or if they see a suitcase or some sort of garment garment bag or whatever that's been on the sidewalk or in a public place 

304.65 315.82 A: for more than ten minutes they call out the bomb squad and they detonate you know no matter what it is so you know i don't know whether there's something that's gonna happen 

307.59 309.33 B: mhm 

310.79 311.86 B: right 

315.89 320.94 A: where that's gonna change you know where that's gonna change it and um 

321.22 330.78 A: you know if something dramatic something really bad happens where it's a package that's on the street or whatever and it and it just detonates [noise] in a high in a high 

331.11 340.29 A: traffic place then those kind of things might end up happening you know so i mean i don't know do you work in a big building or or what yeah 

334.52 336.35 B: right 

338.67 342.34 B: i do i do i work in a big building on fifth avenue 

341.85 355.49 A: yeah yeah so that kind of y- you know you wonder well you know is i- is someone [laughter] this is this is like case scenarios okay it and and i i work i work in a big museum uh here in manhattan 

354.19 355.84 B: mhm 

355.37 360.17 A: you know and uh you know and when when i work there 

360.24 366.21 A: it's just like there's there's thousands of people there every single day and i wonder okay is someone gonna come in 

366.02 376.43 A: and just do something crazy or is or is it someone that that works there you know that's been working there for a for a long time and and they're told hey you gotta do this now 

373.42 375.04 B: mhm 

376.66 385.70 A: [laughter] and they and they they do something crazy you know um it really y- it just y- there's not much you can do 

385.65 396.48 A: but there but it makes you think about what could happen you know and i guess that the fact that ther- there's all those different things can that can happen 

389.73 390.98 B: (( sure mhm )) 

397.05 409.68 A: i just raise i guess it raises new awareness or whatever you know [laughter] the folks that are the folks that are in middle america that are that are like uh they're nearest neighbor is ten miles i guess they don't have to worry as much 

409.62 412.18 A: [noise] you know [laughter] but then again they're they're 

411.00 415.35 B: [noise] maybe and maybe not i don't know there are a lot of um 

415.36 421.18 B: para military groups out that way and that's where oklahoma city happened so 

419.93 424.63 A: right right well then then you're talking about a homegrown kind of terrorist 

424.01 425.78 B: right right 

424.62 438.60 A: and that's i guess that's something to be worried about as well wasn't there wasn't there a guy that that that went into a factory like last week and he just he just mowed down like uh like ten people or something like that 

438.50 445.55 A: he just i i recall hearing about it on the news you know so that's yeah home grown terrorisms is uh 

445.49 456.11 A: is pretty nuts i mean you know that you know you think that okay we live in a great we live in a good country and everything we've got our problems and everything but still we've got a lot more liberties 

454.53 461.06 B: mhm we do but yeah there's no accounting for the actions of totally insane people unfortunately 

459.27 465.79 A: yeah yeah just just random idiots [laughter] that that just wanna wanna do crazy things like that uh

472.51 474.15 B: right 

480.64 485.31 B: right and it could i mean it could have originated from within this country 

484.92 494.28 A: yeah yeah yeah totally totally it was some- you know someone just taking advantage of the situation and saying hey you know uh i've got i've got a beef 

486.15 487.98 B: there's a good chance that the 

493.31 495.01 B: people will pay attention 

494.53 508.14 A: i've got a beef against uh against you know the the media so i'm gonna send these anthrax things to uh to various media places and it's you know it just leaves 

508.05 511.05 A: cause to wonder about what's gonna happen
