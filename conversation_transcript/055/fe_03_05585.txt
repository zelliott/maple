6.07 7.63 A: um you wanna start 

7.71 19.07 B: um sure yeah i can start um [noise] i guess i'll start out by talking about where i was when it first happened i lived uh [noise] i was living in westchester county which is 

19.28 21.85 B: north of new york city it's kind of a suburb 

20.50 22.29 A: yeah i'm from rockland so 

21.92 23.86 B: oh you're rockland okay so 

22.84 23.73 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

23.90 25.00 B: yeah i was just 

25.15 37.27 B: woke up and turned on the news and i mean i guess just an experience as everybody else you know just saw that first plane that had smashed into the tower and uh i mean just saw that smoke coming out of there and just 

28.81 29.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

37.55 44.60 B: had no idea what was going on and then as as i was driving work you know the news kinda unfolded over the radio and uh 

44.45 45.64 A: mhm 

44.74 48.56 B: then the radio just cut out which was pretty scary so uh 

49.51 52.67 B: [lipsmack] uh i don't know i don't know how it's necessarily 

52.95 57.12 B: changed my life in the long run though i could think of it as one of those things that 

57.25 60.93 B: any time there's a traumatic experience like that it really affects you 

61.82 64.20 B: immediately you know i think um 

63.03 63.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

64.08 65.03 A: right 

64.44 73.70 B: i don't know i found myself well i i certainly went to church you know the next day and you know there was sort of this religious reconfirmation 

74.00 77.16 B: and um you know this sense of 

74.07 75.40 A: mhm 

77.82 81.19 B: overwhelming patriotism and the the need to uh 

82.04 82.89 B: (( you know )) 

83.08 85.74 B: do my part to help out and everything but um 

86.72 90.06 B: [lipsmack] i don't know if a year and a half later 

90.22 93.36 B: ultimately how much it's really affected me you 

93.57 96.63 A: um yeah well i mean i i uh 

93.85 94.49 B: (( know )) 

97.96 101.10 A: i think i uh i mean i lost a couple of people that i knew 

100.95 102.32 B: mhm 

101.51 104.39 A: in in the towers um being from new york 

104.28 105.04 B: (( [noise] )) 

104.97 106.13 A: um 

106.28 108.47 A: and i had a friend that uh 

109.20 114.90 A: i knew that was in the towers at the time and i remember sh- freaking out i think i i take a lot less for granted 

114.92 115.96 A: now 

114.96 115.78 B: uh-huh 

116.24 126.82 A: just because of what happened and you know you realize how fragile fragile stuff is and i also i think i you know living in new york city like i appreciate 

121.26 122.10 B: right 

127.39 129.68 A: new york city a lot more now 

129.21 130.30 B: yeah 

129.70 133.31 A: i think 'cause you know n- not just 'cause i was born here 

133.09 134.23 B: right 

133.61 135.92 A: um but you know just 

136.21 145.75 A: i mean i feel you know we get picked on because we're number one and we're on top and i realize that we're a target and you know i i live right now three blocks from ground zero 

140.82 141.66 B: uh-huh 

145.59 146.54 B: oh wow 

146.25 152.68 A: so uh i still think about it every da- i mean i pass ground zero every day on my way to the train you know so i 

149.19 150.30 B: yeah 

150.84 151.68 B: right 

152.04 153.59 B: right 

152.69 160.67 A: um for a lot of people you know it's kinda faded the memory more than it has for me just because every day i see those lights twice a day 

156.25 156.97 B: (( mm )) 

160.68 163.75 B: right yeah 

162.43 163.48 A: um 

164.05 168.04 A: [noise] and also i don't know you know when i get on a plane now you know i think twice 

168.17 169.65 B: mhm 

168.23 171.53 A: always i look around you know i'm more cautious 

171.46 172.40 B: right 

172.56 182.85 A: and uh i mean a lot of the changes that have gone on in society like i've already you know accepted i'm used to seeing guys in the subway you know army guys in the subway now with m16s and 

180.09 180.99 B: right 

181.03 184.71 B: yeah of course it's just something you get used to so 

184.07 189.74 A: whereas i remember when i was in europe seeing that and thinking it was crazy that there were soldiers in the trains and now 

188.23 192.30 B: right yeah you see see it in the airports and stuff like that it's kinda 

191.29 195.02 A: and now it's an an everyday part of life for us and i'm 

194.43 195.55 B: right 

195.82 198.74 A: i'm completely used to it um 

197.60 198.69 B: (( yeah well )) 

199.01 206.23 B: i guess y- you're right it does certainly make me more aware and um i live in new york city now as well so 

204.50 205.58 A: (( okay )) 

206.74 207.63 B: um 

207.66 210.51 B: i guess it's just something that is kinda 

211.22 222.93 B: yeah i mean it's just it- it's raised my awareness certainly you know and i think i i didn't have any personal connections to anybody that was involved in it so i mean that must have been 

223.30 229.21 B: incredibly difficult for you and just really scary were you living down in the area when that happened or 

227.94 240.54 A: no actually i was in school in florida at the time that it happened and uh i um i one of my friends had just stayed at my house in college on his way he was on his way to the airport and he stayed with us for the night 

231.37 232.17 B: (( okay )) 

240.49 247.87 A: to do training uh in the towers um so he had left that monday morning and you know it happened on a tuesday 

248.52 256.51 A: and uh so you know the first thing i thought when i saw it was him he just happened to get lucky he was on a coffee break he was down in the lobby 

256.59 257.63 B: oh wow 

257.13 258.76 A: at the time the plane hit 

258.97 269.46 A: the first plane hit um so he got out but i just remember waking up and you know my phone's been ringing and ringing and i finally woke up and answered it and i turned on the t._v. just in time to see the second plane hit 

259.37 260.30 B: wow 

266.04 266.96 B: yeah 

269.62 270.82 B: yeah 

270.22 280.42 A: and um yeah you know slowly you know you put together you know who got out who didn't and i you know no- nobody i was real close to but definitely people i knew you know 

276.26 277.49 B: right 

279.95 281.07 B: yeah 

280.49 283.15 A: acquaintances or a couple 

283.23 285.63 A: of uh guys i went to high school with 

285.56 288.00 B: right right 

286.67 287.67 A: um 

287.92 292.78 A: but yeah i take i think i take a lot less for granted at least i'd like to think that i do 

292.25 294.02 B: yeah certainly 

293.00 293.96 A: (( uh )) 

293.99 301.78 A: and you know i mean uh parts of my everyday life are definitely affected you know i have season tickets to the giants when i you go to the football game you know 

301.96 309.25 A: it didn't use to take a half hour to get in you're getting patted down metal detectors and and you know the airport you know um 

305.40 306.49 B: [noise] that's true 

308.87 309.64 B: yeah 

309.40 311.39 A: you know and those those things are all 

312.06 314.19 A: an everyday part of life now 

313.96 315.52 B: right 

314.92 315.88 A: um 

316.04 316.62 B: (( yeah )) 

316.41 320.89 A: and i don't know it bothers me i think that a lot of people have become very 

322.58 324.28 A: i just i i think people 

324.33 328.67 A: use it as an excuse to to hate a whole group of people and you know 

327.72 329.26 B: [noise] yeah that's 

329.29 333.41 B: very concerning [noise] i don't do do you think you've seen that happen 

332.52 343.25 A: i i didn't i haven't seen so much in new york because just because it's such it's new york [noise] you know and i mean it's tough to be racist in new york there so many different g- groups of people but 

337.81 339.38 B: (( [noise] right )) 

341.06 342.26 B: yeah 

343.23 354.61 A: uh at the time i was in school in florida and you know there were uh muslim kids getting beat up on campus and just in you know the couple of weeks after and it was just people you know not really knowing how to deal with 

349.06 350.87 B: oh you're kidding me wow 

355.34 358.31 A: what was going on uh but 

356.58 357.44 B: right 

358.60 364.78 A: uh that was probably really disturbing to me like you know i had a friend who's in indian actually and wears a cross around her neck 

364.39 365.33 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

365.17 373.07 A: well you know it's obviously not muslim she was walking through the street and got spit at by somebody who told her to go back to her country you know like 

367.64 368.47 B: right 

371.24 372.37 B: (( wow [noise] )) 

372.98 382.50 A: things like that really bother me that you know i i i think about them more you you know not on a day to day basis but thoughts i things i probably wouldn't have thought twice about i 

378.68 379.71 B: right 

382.53 384.61 A: i think about now 

384.47 391.91 B: [noise] yeah so what uh motivated you to move so close to ground zero after getting out of school 

391.67 399.68 A: um t- to be honest uh price [laughter] um you know the area the government was offering 

395.48 396.50 B: yeah 

400.09 401.28 A: um 

401.72 404.09 A: five hundred dollars for two year leases 

404.19 405.31 B: mhm 

404.69 417.69 A: five hundred dollars a month back um if you moved down here and i mean a lot of people i didn't i didn't get that deal my i'm subleasing from a guy who did but so h- he really moved in when it was still 

407.51 408.40 B: (( yeah )) 

417.93 422.47 A: ground zero i mean now you don't really if you didn't know where ground zero was you wouldn't 

422.27 423.25 B: right 

422.67 434.34 A: notice any difference in this neighborhood but [sigh] um i've always been of the attitude that you know like you can't let stuff like that affect the way you go about your life i'm not gonna be afraid to live down here 

434.24 435.42 B: mhm 

434.76 439.89 A: because of what happened you know uh you i i i was i'm of 

436.74 438.08 B: yeah exactly 

439.92 444.12 A: the firm belief that the way to fight back is to keep going on 

444.12 445.23 B: right 

444.62 447.01 A: n- normally you know and not let them 

447.38 456.37 A: not let terrorism change your life and and you know it doesn't bother me i don't think that you know they're gonna hit the stock exchange now you know i hear that all the time or 

454.22 455.18 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

456.60 459.61 A: you know i mean if that happens it happens but 

459.93 466.90 A: i you know i mean i'm a few blocks from the brooklyn bridge you know people they say they're gonna hit that you know i i can't think about things like that really 

460.05 461.43 B: (( yeah right )) 

467.04 474.78 B: what do you feel about um like the patriot act and all these other measures that have been taken by congress and by the government to um 

475.65 476.77 B: sort of 

477.01 481.90 B: um handle the uh the terrorist threat you know or a peace threat 

480.79 484.63 A: i think it's a very fine line we're walking 

484.66 486.11 A: (( like you know they )) 

486.15 491.46 A: there there's national security and then there's uh you know there's ethnocentrically 

492.11 493.36 A: you can't 

493.64 499.78 A: look into people's backgrounds strictly because they're arab and they make a certain amount of money or strictly you know it- it's just 

497.97 499.24 B: right 

499.84 511.36 A: i it it goes against i mean granted you know desperate times you know diff- different times call for different measures but i just kinda feel like the tenets that our society has found that aren't always you know 

510.30 512.80 B: (( right )) 

512.10 516.03 A: w- the it's like it- it's we open our country to everybody 

515.89 517.08 B: (( [noise] right )) 

516.47 517.79 A: and 

518.06 528.54 A: i mean it was a terrible thing that happened but we can't go against all our principles because then at the same time now i mean we do have to be more careful and more aware of who's in the country [noise] and what they're doing but 

527.80 530.14 B: (( mhm mm )) 

528.75 530.85 A: (( i don't know what do you think )) 

530.64 536.45 B: uh i don't know it's something that kind of it's it's something that certainly concerns me i mean i 

536.70 547.02 B: [mn] i'm not a conspiracy theorist i don't believe that september eleventh was planned in advance or that the government necessarily had any knowledge of it or anything but 

545.55 547.35 A: (( right )) 

547.10 552.86 B: um i am concerned about some of the measures that are being taken to ensure our security um 

552.87 554.90 B: that that 

555.63 561.35 B: i don't know i mean just the patriot act and things like that sort of the access to information that they have being 

561.39 562.48 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

561.58 568.18 B: the ability that they have to detain people without offering them any sort of representation or 

567.03 572.47 A: right yeah i mean i just think that kind goes against the tenets that our society was founded on you know 

568.48 569.57 B: (( things like that )) 

571.86 573.52 B: right 

572.91 574.02 A: um 

574.40 577.81 A: i just i that bothers me a little you know that 

577.58 578.40 B: yeah 

577.82 588.34 A: we have people being held for months and months not being charged with anything you know i mean if i would have told you that ten years ago that would have been absolutely unacceptable 

582.60 583.75 B: right 

588.26 589.27 B: right 

588.65 596.54 A: and now you know just because the [mn] certain terrorist groups attacked our country that's now acceptable i'm not 

596.59 598.60 A: you know i'm not sure that that 

599.13 599.95 B: right
