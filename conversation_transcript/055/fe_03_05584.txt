0.98 2.94 A: hi i'm dave 

3.14 5.60 B: hey dave uh my name's kyle 

6.10 7.23 A: how's it going 

7.26 8.48 B: not too bad 

8.63 10.88 A: all right um 

11.23 13.25 A: it's a pretty interesting topic 

13.35 14.52 A: um 

15.12 26.29 A: i don't really think i've changed much um i don't travel much so i haven't really felt the physical affects of like airport security and stuff like that i have a lot of friends who do so 

20.07 21.13 B: right 

24.75 25.51 B: right 

26.30 27.21 B: okay 

26.78 28.68 A: i hear about it a lot what about you 

28.70 31.72 B: it's it's a little kind of a um 

32.17 39.26 B: [lipsmack] kind of an odd situation for me i actually worked in the world trade center for uh a few years i i was a stockbroker at morgan stanley 

38.69 39.75 A: uh-huh 

39.14 53.83 B: and uh actually had had left about nine months before the actual situation but um in terms of actually changing anything in terms of my travel or things like that like it hasn't really changed anything i've only flown i think 

53.79 60.92 B: two or three times since since it actually happened but it it wouldn't really inhibit anything that i that i would have done normally anyway 

61.04 63.16 B: [noise] for the most part 

61.37 62.48 A: [noise] i understand 

63.13 64.91 A: all right um 

65.94 75.38 A: well i'm kinda active i'm i'm a college student and i'm i'm kinda active on campus but uh i think i've gotten a little more active i think um 

70.89 71.80 B: okay 

75.58 88.14 A: already kind of cared about international events but that news is a lot harder to get than just your general what's going on locally but i think i definitely work harder to try to keep up with that stuff now 

79.09 79.96 B: right 

84.38 85.12 B: (( true )) 

88.43 102.15 A: and and kinda not just i wanna hear it but like really trying to kinda keep tabs on what all's going on and paying attention to trying to remember what happened last week and have i heard about it you know like 

102.10 112.95 A: stories like the weapons of mass destruction that haven't really been answered yet i kinda i remember to keep listening to 'em waiting to see what happens instead of kinda just letting the news wash over [noise] 

110.26 111.87 B: (( right )) 

112.78 118.36 B: right you you really gotta you know stay on toes with with those that are involved you know in terms of 

118.40 122.16 B: uh just about anything i i live in the the manhattan area so it's 

122.23 132.08 B: you know there's always threats of of different types of uh you know attacks and of of you know in different ways subways or tunnels or bridges or whatever the case may be 

131.55 132.62 A: right 

132.02 140.74 B: i think you kinda have to be a little more you know like you said on your toes but you know you can't really let it affect your lifestyle uh too much 'cause that's 

139.58 141.68 A: right right 

141.01 144.45 B: it's kinda giving into wh- what what these guys want 

143.88 145.26 A: (( [noise] [noise] gotcha )) 

146.53 150.71 A: that makes sense that makes sense yeah i definitely have [mn] 

150.80 164.59 A: spent time kinda trying to understand different sides it's really hard here to get people's opinions that are in iraq and iran and afghanistan and actually hear what they think about it and it 

165.26 175.75 A: i think i'm always amazed you think about living here how everybody has different opinions on everything but i think we tend to think of of other places as being 

175.76 182.20 A: not not really that way and so i'm always amazed to hear people who feel completely different on 

182.35 186.57 A: these issues from those countries people who get really mad when 

186.30 192.91 B: yeah right well of course 'cause it i mean a a lot of the stuff that goes on over in the in the arab countries it's more you know 

186.58 187.46 A: united 

193.02 201.83 B: going back to the like the old soviet union days in like eastern europe where it's all propaganda like a lot of stuff the al jazeira network and things like that it's 

201.76 210.27 B: strictly propaganda it's not real news it's not real information it's it's basically what what they want to portray for for different events and you know that's 

202.75 203.82 A: right 

208.92 209.77 A: right 

210.11 218.62 B: 'cause you know whoever handles the networks is is gonna do that we see that a little bit in united states but it's not not even close to what it is in other countries 

217.03 217.92 A: right 

218.66 219.36 B: so 

218.75 219.67 A: yeah 

219.45 226.10 B: that's that's a big influential factor for for people in other countries to you know it's it it's all they know 

226.95 228.78 A: right 

228.80 239.71 A: yeah definitely definitely and and it definitely makes you think about how how hard is it for us to hear multiple accounts of the same events 

239.80 240.71 B: right 

239.92 242.41 A: in in those places 'cause 

242.51 252.06 A: you know like when when news in france is just an election or something it's not a big deal but when when there's an international war going on 

247.59 248.62 B: (( right mhm )) 

252.04 259.41 A: and you realize that everything you hear about it is the same like every front page story on every newspaper is the same 

259.43 274.43 A: and it it really gets you thinking about what does that mean is what is that good is that bad is there really you know is somebody giving us a biased where does this you know where's the story coming from because 

273.40 285.74 B: yeah yeah and most and most of it's so biased because you know whoever is gonna be the person running the story is gonna be is gonna run the story in their best interest or you know to to to you know for their benefit and really you know 

278.99 280.09 A: right 

281.11 282.48 A: exactly 

283.87 284.65 A: yeah 

286.00 294.85 A: and there there never seems to be a source when there's when there's these big uh news stories they're never telling you whether they're 

286.26 287.24 B: really 

295.05 300.85 A: getting this from a military source or are they getting this from an operative there they just kind of 

300.86 309.56 A: give you the story like today this happened and you have to sit there and wonder who told 'em that happened and why they would they want you to know that 

308.98 318.33 B: exactly that's why a lot of these stories when they when they come out they change you know five ten fifteen times before actually like they they plan stories 

318.59 319.35 B: (( you know )) 

318.62 319.95 A: right 

319.42 320.88 B: (( it's confirmed )) 

321.22 321.97 B: (( um )) 

323.08 325.10 B: yeah you never know [laughter] 

325.05 327.02 A: definitely definitely never know 

333.49 337.61 A: all right that's about all i have to say on the subject uh how's the weather up there 

337.90 346.12 B: it's really it's not too bad it's um today was about [lipsmack] a little cooler it was about sixty eight and um 

345.01 347.27 A: oh that's not bad at all [noise] 

346.72 356.93 B: yeah not bad a little a little cloudier than it's than it had been but you know at the least uh the ninety five ninety eight degree weather that you know we had over the few weeks kinda cooled down a little bit 

356.63 358.46 A: right right [mn] 

357.21 359.55 B: that's been nice but 

359.50 368.12 A: that that that's pretty nice i lived down in uh north carolina and it was it was definitely ninety five today and sweltering
