0.46 1.91 A: hello 

1.26 2.60 B: hello 

2.29 4.54 A: hello this is david in utah 

4.30 7.02 B: hi david i'm ryan i'm in new hampshire 

6.89 8.18 A: how's it going 

7.82 9.57 B: it's going good how are you 

9.09 10.72 A: oh not too bad 

10.10 11.92 B: is this the first time you've done this 

11.64 14.26 A: uh this is my third call now 

13.63 19.00 B: third time this is my second uh i didn't quite hear the topic what is what is it 

17.89 28.31 A: i kinda missed the very end but what i the best i heard was do the schools have the right to tell our kids what books they can read 

28.05 29.05 B: okay 

29.63 31.11 B: well what do you think man 

31.00 31.97 A: uh 

32.16 41.98 A: i think that sure they should be able to suggest different books for kids to read i i mean they're teachers and they've read a lot they should know 

42.10 51.13 A: which ones might be good and which ones are bad but it's not i don't see how they could tell 'em what they can't read 

45.28 47.12 B: mhm 

51.49 53.01 B: okay how come 

53.94 56.08 A: uh well 'cause 

54.90 55.62 B: how 

56.14 57.31 B: (( g._o. ahead )) 

56.62 64.18 A: if you find a book and you want to read i think everyone has the freedom of choice to read what they want to read 

63.67 73.10 B: mhm what if it was like pornography or something or you know not like pornography in as in pictures but like pornographic reading 

70.51 71.58 A: yeah 

72.38 74.82 A: yeah the the 

75.01 83.02 A: some of them girl novels could be considered that for sure but like i said if the kids are gonna find it and they're gonna read it they're going to 

78.45 79.37 B: yeah 

82.75 91.59 B: mhm so you don't think a a teacher has the right to tell like a kid in the class not to read like pornographic book or something 

83.54 84.66 A: uh 

91.72 96.34 A: yeah i guess they could them that [laughter] but it would probably backfire on them 

93.99 95.07 B: [laughter] 

96.24 98.37 B: yeah see i see it 

96.72 102.59 A: you know how it is you tell 'em not to do something and usually that's what they're gonna do yeah 

100.32 105.13 B: [laughter] right yeah a rebellious nature yeah definitely um 

103.13 104.37 A: (( [laughter] )) 

105.34 114.66 B: for see i see i agree that i agree that on some level you can't actually literally stop them from reading certain things 

111.03 112.12 A: yeah 

112.61 117.51 A: yeah and i guess i'm just a little too far out there 'cause that's what i'm saying yeah 

116.89 129.57 B: yeah i mean you can't actually stop them but i think w- once you once they're in a school if they're in their private school or public school it seems like they've agreed to 

123.59 124.62 A: uh-huh 

126.01 127.03 A: correct 

130.08 139.97 B: either with their parents' permission or not they've agreed to put themselves under certain restrictions or certain guidelines that the school sets up so if a teacher 

132.09 133.11 A: uh-huh 

138.19 139.17 A: uh-huh 

139.72 140.64 A: true 

140.28 151.01 B: if a teacher says hey don't read that it seems like if they've set put themselves under that guideline then they then the teacher therefore does have the right to do that 

148.59 149.54 A: uh-huh 

150.11 159.00 A: yeah and i believe you're correct because you know it goes without saying why those schools can put whatever books they want in the libraries you know and take 'em out so 

157.24 158.18 B: right 

158.72 168.16 B: right but i think maybe the ultimate question they're trying to get us to talk about is i think it said something like the topic was censorship i think 

163.69 164.70 A: uh-huh 

167.29 169.25 A: yeah censorship 

168.51 173.61 B: so maybe that maybe what they're actually trying to get at is like whether 

171.49 172.47 A: uh-huh 

173.93 175.01 B: uh 

175.62 187.83 B: whether there should be any kind of like standard set for what someone can read and what someone can't read because if the standard is simply desire 

187.44 189.73 A: oh i see uh-huh 

188.10 191.81 B: like the standard is if the standard is simply well 

191.91 194.33 B: you know do you want to read it 

193.65 195.60 A: yeah and though 

194.57 196.36 B: well that's not much of a standard 

195.72 200.54 A: a second grader a second grader that can read fifth grade books you mean 

200.77 202.20 B: uh 

201.38 202.54 A: and then 

202.55 209.97 B: yeah i guess i mean that's [mn] i i was actually kind of thinking i man maybe that's part of it i was actually thinking more in the lines of like 

210.13 212.93 B: virtue or morality like where 

212.30 213.58 A: yeah 

212.96 215.55 B: like is there are there standards 

216.52 224.45 B: are found like in nature or or what have you that that allow for censor- censorship 

218.72 219.42 A: (( okay )) 

224.19 225.24 A: uh-huh 

224.84 227.46 B: because like if if i say 

227.97 236.59 B: if i say um well there's really no standard for what a person should or shouldn't read um 

236.98 245.72 B: it seems like [mn] it seems like if that's really what i'm saying and i'm really being consistent with that theory 

241.16 245.01 A: (( yeah )) 

245.55 258.70 B: then i could never tell my kids don't read that or a teacher could never tell kids in their class don't read that or you know there there it seems like there's at that point there's absolutely nothing you can do 

258.57 259.62 A: uh-huh 

260.17 262.67 B: someone from doing about anything 

262.34 264.13 A: correct i think 

264.75 266.92 A: think that they should just 

266.81 272.74 A: if it's talking about school books 'cause i've heard before about them changing history books [laughter] and 

271.66 273.84 B: mhm 

272.59 282.31 A: and telling stuff i think they should just put the truth in the books and let [noise] the kids decide for themselves [noise] 

279.32 284.73 B: mhm hm oh i hear a train in the background 

283.10 285.90 A: yeah i live right next to the train tracks 

285.26 287.79 B: oh that must get interesting 

287.50 292.02 A: yeah after a little while you don't listen too much 

292.14 296.42 A: but i heard it coming so i was outside so i had to run inside 

295.66 298.58 B: (( [laughter] oh [laughter] )) 

299.08 304.06 B: so do you think that there's like like okay well here's a question do you have kids 

304.24 307.63 A: i do actually school kids two daughters 

306.26 307.20 B: okay 

307.51 308.96 B: (( how old are they )) 

308.75 310.45 A: uh six and eleven 

310.24 314.41 B: now like with your eleven year old well well can you six year old read 

314.29 316.02 A: not really 

315.34 322.88 B: not really well well with your eleven year old like do you say it do you like limit what she can read 

316.46 317.27 A: (( no )) 

318.38 319.48 A: yeah 

323.08 324.52 A: (( uh )) 

325.49 337.35 A: well when it went to pornographic yeah i probably would but i haven't run into the instance where i've had to limit what she read i i censor movies she watch 

331.66 335.76 B: right right well in the instance that 

337.18 340.36 B: okay well that's kind of the same issue well in the instance that you 

338.56 339.51 A: yeah 

340.37 348.27 B: that you limit her from watching a movie or read a book what is what is what is your reasoning like why do you limit it what do you not allow her to 

348.61 359.12 A: because of her age which is correct and she's not able to handle to some of the certain adult situations that come about 

358.73 362.27 B: okay what do you mean like she isn't able to handle them 

361.46 365.16 A: uh well maybe she's just not ready for 'em 

364.67 367.30 B: huh well like what if um 

366.27 369.69 A: so so you proved your point pretty good there yeah 

369.08 374.05 B: [laughter] yeah i'm just curious because like i'm curious to know why people 

371.13 372.16 A: uh-huh 

373.43 375.99 A: (( well for in- instance )) 

376.15 380.16 A: the public library i just had to talk with them because two 

380.14 388.80 A: my daughter and a friend two eleven year old girls go out and they rent movies and they rent this c._d. and it has 

388.71 391.51 A: has this lesbian girl in it 

390.91 392.16 B: mhm 

391.41 400.66 A: who tries to be a boy and puts a plastic penis in her pants and goes and gets it on with this girl showing their breasts at the park and then they're 

399.60 400.84 B: oh my goodness 

400.56 410.32 A: and then they're smoking weed out of a bong and drinking beer driving down the road and yeah and yeah it's a movie something 

403.86 405.12 B: this is a 

406.57 408.40 B: this is a movie or 

409.26 410.35 B: my goodness 

410.38 413.07 A: when boys cry or something 

412.47 413.64 B: (( oh okay )) 

413.33 418.85 A: and i took it back to the library and said what the heck you're giving this to eleven year old girls for 

418.14 419.71 B: yeah yeah 

418.98 429.96 A: well it's your job to censor and know what they're seeing watching it and i'm like well yeah but sounds like a good title and blah blah blah and then my girls are telling me about it 

427.03 428.22 B: yeah 

429.51 440.12 B: see i see that fact that like like if if if our society deems that um just desire is a standard for censorship 

430.63 431.77 A: (( yeah )) 

434.35 435.19 A: uh-huh 

440.06 444.57 B: like if all that you need is to say i wanna watch it 

444.42 456.03 B: or i wanna read it or whatever it seems like you're always gonna run into situations like that because then the librarian says well you know this kid wants to watch it so and you know maybe she may 

445.98 446.99 A: (( correct )) 

453.83 454.76 A: uh-huh 

456.08 460.56 B: i think it's a cop out to say that that you should be the one 

460.72 466.19 B: that you know as if you're gonna know exactly what she you know what she's always watching so 

463.97 465.04 A: uh-huh 

466.93 468.67 B: the point is that 

468.57 482.99 B: like it it it seems like if you get rid of any standards above just what someone wants like it's always gonna lead to situations like that where you have a librarian that just won't say no or you have a teacher that won't say no 

474.63 475.61 A: uh-huh 

479.71 480.55 A: yeah 

482.77 483.56 A: and 

482.91 493.58 B: or what have you 'cause even then even then see she may say well it's your job now to censor it right but you know as time progresses it seems like 

489.30 490.46 A: correct 

493.51 503.43 B: if desire is the standard then even you won't be able to stop your kids from watching anything because well you know the kid wants to so who are you as a parent 

502.59 504.32 A: no you can i think 

504.30 516.65 A: it kinda brings me in final decision about the subject the best we know it is in the end i think the schools should censor what the kids read and tell to the bare minimum 

516.48 522.94 A: and then let the parents decide above that where the kids can venture and where they can't 

522.35 528.07 B: mhm that's interesting um what if like your child was 

528.10 538.71 B: like twenty five let's say now obviously she isn't necessarily in your house or you she you can't like limit her obviously what she does but like 

533.59 534.80 A: (( yeah she's got )) 

536.22 537.09 A: correct 

538.69 547.71 B: in that case like let's say hypothetically you could limit her but she was an adult would you limit her like would you not allow her rent 

542.55 543.25 A: (( yeah )) 

543.92 544.76 A: okay 

547.56 555.41 B: pornographic movies or pornographic books or whatever like if if in a perfect world you were able to stop her from it 

554.10 556.11 A: yeah uh 

555.32 563.42 B: okay but the the reason you gave for not allowing her now that she's eleven was the fact that she was too young what if she was older 

563.74 565.32 B: like what's your reasoning then 

565.04 570.23 A: then i would let let her do what she wanted now would i let her 

570.91 581.09 A: watch it in my house with a younger sister or you know the circumstances when someone when it wouldn't be appropriate i'd limit it then but if 

575.21 576.90 B: mhm 

580.94 587.49 A: she wanted to look at pornographic materials at that age then yes i would let her 

586.90 587.87 B: but now 

587.95 589.69 B: now i know you would let her 

588.14 591.97 A: because she would be an adult and she would have 

591.69 593.52 B: right well 

592.28 595.60 A: she would have the thought processes 

595.80 599.89 A: as mature as they're gonna get to where she can decide whether she like
