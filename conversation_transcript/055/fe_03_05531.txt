154.46 162.66 B: and do you um um when you uh do any particular stretching like um yoga or or do you stretch on your own or 

162.13 167.67 A: i just stretch on my own i don't really know any of the yoga techniques to say i'm gonna try i never can 

167.55 170.60 B: yeah i don't know them either i'm just curious about it myself 

168.26 169.66 A: afford any of these sports 

170.19 171.33 A: oh okay 

171.06 173.24 B: yeah 

171.96 174.97 A: i heard they're really good but i've never done any as i say 

175.95 186.04 B: yeah neither have i [noise] but i mean i just really i mean i just want to s- just really maximize my flexibility i mean and there's a style of different yoga p- um 

182.90 183.80 A: mhm 

186.20 199.67 B: ty- types of different yoga classes that i've heard about but i think um there's one i can't remember quite what it is called but it's really you're in a hot hot room i don't know if i like it that much but the temperature is like in like in the nineties and the hundreds 

189.06 189.94 A: yeah 

196.51 197.41 A: uh-oh 

199.28 200.32 A: uh-oh 

199.75 207.58 B: so yeah i know you're like sweated down but it loosens all your [noise] muscles and everything but if it's really bearable to sit in there that long i don't know 

206.85 208.46 A: i don't think so [laughter] 

207.75 220.90 B: yeah [laughter] that was what that was what about my conclusion too um but you know it just it just supposed to you know be really good for you but there's other types also there's also pilates which i have tried before too 

208.59 209.76 A: [laughter] 

217.73 218.60 A: mhm 

220.60 221.90 A: what is that like 

221.33 223.62 B: pilates it's like um [lipsmack] 

223.81 231.22 B: it's not it's not s- it's not stretching [noise] like yoga it's it's quite easy in fact than what i thought it's just more like 

231.38 242.79 B: uh uh all around conditioning [noise] but you know very very low impact it's was okay it was okay i really wasn't for it i think i'd rather get into some serious stretching 

236.68 237.78 A: mhm 

242.56 255.04 A: yeah 'cause like there's a yoga place opposite my my college and i see so many people stretching and i'll be like oh my god is that humanly possible i'm thinking i'm thinking how good the muscles must feel 'cause the kind of positions they may be in 

243.15 243.74 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

250.09 251.61 B: [laughter] 

254.68 264.24 B: [noise] yeah yeah uh it it takes training it takes some serious training actually i did take a a stretch eh a stretch and strength class at my gym 

264.14 264.90 A: mhm 

264.21 274.54 B: um while they had it for like a a month or two but [noise] it's amazing i mean how you get you know y- you get flexible and strength at the same time normally you're like 

266.98 268.05 A: oh okay 

274.49 282.33 B: you think moves you no way you could've done like a month or so earlier now you find yourself being able to uh to accomplish that 

278.30 279.36 A: right 

282.98 291.69 B: so you know i want to do them as much as i can and i just mean just exercising throughout the whole week just gives me more energy throughout the whole week [noise] 

289.41 290.26 A: yeah 

291.38 297.00 A: um i was interesting in finding out exercises for the abs though because i'm kind of losing my abs 

296.68 297.70 B: (( the abs )) 

297.09 300.78 A: um particularly for the lower abs what exercises do you do 

299.07 300.42 B: mhm 

300.58 314.18 B: uh there's a couple of things i do uh [noise] one thing is like you can hang from a bar uh or there's some kind of say um laundry hanging or just pulling yourself up up in the air you put your feet together and you um bring your knees to your chest 

300.89 302.06 A: (( you say )) 

304.69 305.67 A: mhm 

313.57 314.97 A: okay yeah 

314.42 326.17 B: that's good and if you really want to get a good effect with that what you do once you get used to doing that maybe like three sets of um maybe twenty or thirty or whatever you can do um you can you can put some weights in between your feet 

322.76 323.67 A: mhm 

326.05 327.35 A: (( okay )) 

326.12 331.26 B: like a twenty pound or fifteen pound weight or a ten pound whatever you can handle and you do it that way 

330.96 331.86 A: right 

331.29 337.70 B: you don't have to go heavy on the weights with that you just do that and keep keep it controlled also what i do i will lay down on the bench 

333.76 334.78 A: right right 

337.59 341.48 B: [lipsmack] um on my back uh put my arms on the side of the bench 

341.31 351.80 B: um put my feet straight up in the air and so like your your legs are straight up and your hips are off the bench and [noise] you um just push your feet up into the air and bring 

351.61 364.85 B: you know and bring your [noise] hips back down not really touching the bench but all just back down so up and down up and down and at the same time you must think and concentrate on your stomach and what part of your stomach you're working on when you do that 'cause it's all for your lower 

356.65 357.99 A: mhm oh okay 

363.63 364.47 A: right 

364.71 370.47 B: ab ab abs but when you think about it you can do that that's really good for that 

370.05 372.70 A: mhm that sounds really difficult also 

372.32 375.29 B: yeah it's good and also a good thing is um 

375.31 382.89 B: there's like this ball it's i mean a wheel and you've probably seen it on t._v. it's uh it's like a wheel and it has like two handles sticking out and you get on it 

381.99 384.74 A: oh does that really work 'cause i i i have seen it 

384.17 387.85 B: yeah it works it works you put it you get on your knees [lipsmack] 

387.92 390.38 B: and you wheel out as far as you can 

389.88 390.74 A: mhm 

390.35 404.59 B: and bring it back in yeah you keep doing those and that really works too you got to keep your back straight 'cause you need to to keep your forearms out there because it's it's hard work on those two but it definitely does do something for your abs absolutely 

399.01 399.82 A: right 

404.38 406.17 A: oh that sounds good [noise] 

405.54 413.46 B: yeah that's good stuff so that's really good for the abs and um lower abs especially 

413.85 416.05 B: and um yeah 

416.66 420.13 B: (( um let me see what else is good for the abs there is um )) 

420.94 425.71 B: [noise] yeah um inclines um or incline or decline sit-ups 

424.78 426.19 A: what is that 

425.87 431.86 B: you um it's like you go on a bench that's sloped up you put your feet up and do your sit-ups that way 

429.46 430.31 A: mhm 

431.54 433.07 A: oh okay okay 

432.21 434.58 B: yeah that's really good for it too 

435.18 440.03 B: so yeah and you know and basically you know and once you get you know once you get that stuff working um 

440.10 447.87 B: for you you just have to um i mean if you want to uh watch what you eat cut down the carbos when you get some carbos cut them down also there the sh- 

446.12 449.33 A: yeah uh i'm actually on the atkins diet right now 

448.85 458.95 B: oh you are oh okay so you know then and um yeah if you just do those exer- uh the exercises and stay with them diligently you will definitely see the results in your abs 

449.63 450.61 A: yeah 

458.32 459.60 A: mhm 

458.98 460.84 B: yeah and stuff like that 

460.10 463.38 A: oh cool how long do you think it might take like three weeks four weeks 

462.77 470.21 B: um [sigh] give yourself if you do it um three or four times a week give yourself uh three to four weeks 

469.87 470.96 A: (( okay mhm )) 

470.42 478.85 B: yeah yeah about three to four weeks drink a lot of fluids and everything like water and um definitely that also um

490.99 501.24 B: that's the best i mean you'll probably start off with doing like ten or fifteen minutes you'll get tired but if you can work yourself up to half an hour or more or you know regularly [mn] that'd be real it's [noise] amazing 

501.39 504.97 B: yeah r- and it helps with your with your vertical jump too you'll be amazed
