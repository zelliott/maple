123.76 126.91 B: you know bicycling or running or whatever 

127.52 136.95 A: yeah we would w- we used to walk my wife and i did a lot of walking but it it it just wasn't enough i mean we weren't faithful to it i think the way to go to uh 

137.12 149.93 A: you know if you can find time is to get get into the gym and you know get some uh get some good workout i enj- i enjoyed it uh you know i'm gonna renew the membership and stick with it 

149.72 155.08 B: [mn] yeah it's definitely beneficial di- did you say you were in buffalo or albany 

154.47 155.47 A: buffalo 

155.36 163.76 B: buffalo well i was gonna say i know i have some friends that live in buffalo judy and ronald and from what i hear it's not too easy to get outside there [laughter] 

163.47 170.35 A: well you know i'm i'm not far from where the uh the fitness center is so in the winter time it isn't much of a ride 

170.62 174.77 A: but uh yeah you're right when when the weather gets bad it's tough getting around 

174.37 176.17 B: yep 

175.01 176.32 A: but uh 

176.47 179.52 A: i get exercise shoveling the snow [laughter]

182.46 184.56 A: but but we um 

185.22 192.29 A: [lipsmack] we you know like i said i i uh the my knees have been bothering me and uh so i haven't been using the bicycle 

192.44 193.65 A: but uh 

194.70 197.89 A: [lipsmack] i'm uh getting some strength back and uh 

198.11 201.19 A: you know i d- my weight has went down and uh 

201.40 204.68 A: and i think uh the health and fitness today is uh 

204.86 209.30 A: being emphasized a lot more remember you know than when i was a teenage anyway 

209.32 212.12 B: oh yeah what age are you marty 

211.66 212.96 A: (( pardon me )) 

212.70 214.31 B: what what age are you 

213.80 215.26 A: i'm fifty five 

215.29 217.20 B: okay 'cause i'm thirty nine 

216.67 218.05 A: oh okay thought 

217.23 226.76 B: and uh one one thing i really noticed working out it seems that the people that had been working out at my gym this was you know when i was in my 

226.92 228.66 B: mid twenties late twenties 

228.86 243.46 B: that were working out there for a couple of years 'cause you get after a couple of years at the same place you [noise] get to know everybody all the regulars as i call them and it seemed that people that really worked out two or three times a week that had been there for a few years 

236.32 237.40 A: yeah 

243.41 248.53 B: they looked almost ten years to fifteen years younger and they acted younger 

248.62 251.97 B: so i think the benefit i mean just starting now 

252.35 257.16 B: you know and you've been at it for a couple of months you're gonna see a huge difference in about another year and a 

253.96 254.84 A: yeah 

257.03 270.11 B: half it takes a while because i remember at one point when i was twenty three i wanted to bulk up i wanted to get muscles and all that kind of stuff you know and i'd been trying and trying and trying and um 

264.87 265.71 A: mhm 

270.01 281.75 B: it took me almost eighteen months before i really noticed anything happen and then it was like overnight it was just wow i've now i've got a deltoid where i used to have a shoulder bone sticking out you 

281.68 289.42 B: know and when i was scrawny now i've got some weight of course now i'm thirty nine and going back to the opposite i wanna lose my weight so um 

288.53 289.77 A: [laughter] 

289.99 295.74 B: you know it's now not trying to gain weight it's trying to keep what i have under control 

294.31 300.47 A: yeah do you do any walking in the h- atlanta looks pretty hilly my i know my son actually my son lives there he uh 

301.05 306.08 A: he uh he does a lot of running but i i don't know how you can run in that humidity 

306.09 316.42 B: yeah i it it's pretty bad as far as the humidity in the summer in the late summer it's um if you don't get out and walk in the mornings before nine o'clock you're pretty much 

306.51 307.32 A: i was 

316.51 319.47 B: incapacitated during the hot summer months 

317.76 318.60 A: right 

318.91 323.05 A: yeah w- that's what my wife and i did we we got up at six and then uh 

323.44 328.56 A: we showered and then uh we had breakfast and then uh went out to the volleyball but uh 

328.63 331.00 A: yeah i enjoyed atlanta it was pretty nice 

331.10 343.56 B: [noise] yeah i live actually i live in downtown atlanta near the um the museum at piedmont park that's the area that's uh the downtown i live in and [noise] i it's 

343.68 351.74 B: i used to try to get at least four days a week of one hour to forty five minutes of aerobic something and i mean 

350.22 354.14 A: right me t- yeah that's what i was doing i was doing about forty five minutes 

353.96 362.84 B: i usually it it got to the point where i i wanted to work out you know two hours a day and it just do- doesn't go any more 

354.55 355.70 A: (( but um )) 

356.41 357.23 A: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

362.91 366.88 A: yeah yeah i i just try to regulate it to an hour because uh 

367.20 372.41 A: [noise] i'm getting a l- i work and uh i lift tires all day at at uh 

372.43 375.57 A: at work and uh i get a good workout at work too [laughter] 

374.61 377.34 B: (( [laughter] ))

383.04 384.43 A: and uh 

384.49 391.65 B: yeah most most bailey's are pretty nice as far as facilities go there's a there used to be a few down here but i think they got bought out by uh 

387.43 388.63 A: yeah 

391.77 401.52 B: crunch or l._a. fitness or something there was one company that came in and bought a whole lot of them down here in atlanta and the south east i think it's l._a. fitness 

401.27 403.73 A: they got golds g. o. l. d. s. 

403.64 406.59 B: yes we do have golds gym 

404.79 410.28 A: g- yeah yeah 'cause they uh they just popped up a couple of them and here 

410.29 411.88 B: (( yeah )) 

410.30 411.72 A: but um [lipsmack] 

411.80 419.32 A: you know they they seem i know my friend was gonna get out and uh they gave him a pretty good uh deal to stay in 

412.01 412.64 B: (( yeah )) 

420.37 429.48 B: yeah bailey from what i understand [noise] once you get in there for a year or so they make it very enticing for you to stay it's almost like it costs you 

423.98 424.74 A: yeah 

429.52 433.89 B: like half of what it was originally to [noise] join just to stay monthly 

433.47 435.30 A: yeah yeah that's uh 

435.59 440.54 A: that's uh that's what i'm counting on but uh i'm trying to get the kids to uh 

441.06 449.46 A: uh get a little more physical fitness uh a- and and in their diet you know too too many chicken wings here in buffalo you know 

449.40 452.44 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

449.88 452.62 A: they add the they add the pounds on too 

452.65 453.89 A: (( too much )) 

454.03 454.84 A: (( yeah i've )) 

454.14 454.89 B: (( you know )) 

454.93 459.08 A: go- so i'm uh kinda laying off of them how many of these calls have you done 

459.35 461.02 B: this is my first one 

461.05 462.08 A: oh okay 

462.04 463.11 B: how about you 

463.17 465.90 A: i did one yesterday and then they called me again 

465.92 467.10 A: yesterday 

467.57 477.06 A: but i think you can only do three but i i did- i didn't think they would i didn't think they would call like right away [noise] but i i wasn't that sure about how uh 

477.35 479.59 A: you know how it would work out but uh 

480.17 484.63 A: uh you know it seems like it's uh pretty organized and uh 

484.42 486.87 B: (( yeah it's i think )) 

484.88 485.63 A: they m- 

485.87 489.36 A: they must take the topic and then give it to somebody for research 

489.41 502.74 B: it's yeah the um from what i understand the research that they're doing is based on the topic of conversation [noise] and then they match you up with um someone else just whoever wants to [noise] discuss the topic 

502.09 503.36 A: mhm 

502.80 508.26 B: like they keep calling me and leaving messages and 'cause i put in my cellphone number so it's um 

508.48 518.41 B: weird topics like one was confrontational situations another one was like the uh current um policies with iraq uh 

518.40 527.32 B: i mean it's current pol- it's current topics but some things i'm just like i don't think i could discuss this 'cause i don't know enough about it or i don't have opinions about it 

525.92 529.71 A: yeah yeah i discussed censorship yesterday for ten minutes 

529.71 530.59 B: (( ah )) 

530.46 533.71 A: but uh physical fitness seems a little easier 

533.88 535.27 A: you know i mean 

533.99 535.70 B: (( yeah it is )) 

535.53 543.29 A: i mean today's i forgot what the number of people the percentage of people that are actually obese is is astronomical 

543.33 546.14 B: oh yeah america's the worst i 

546.37 553.68 B: mean my father he um just recently last year got diagnosed at age sixty two with colon cancer 

546.63 547.24 A: (( [cough] )) 

553.12 554.12 A: (( ugh )) 

553.65 568.56 B: and i am convinced that it is totally related to his diet because he um growing up in alabama you eat everything fried and battered and deep fried and [laughter] it's like eating buffalo wings all the time 

558.11 558.69 A: (( mm )) 

567.38 573.25 A: yeah well i'm trying to i'm trying to change my diet to be physically more fit because uh 

573.41 582.38 A: uh basically 'cause of the weight so my wife's got me counting the calories and cutting down on the salt and and the exercise it helps out so [lipsmack] 

583.01 584.39 A: but um 

583.01 584.07 B: so yeah one 

583.93 593.96 B: thing one thing i noticed 'cause i'm i'm in the same situation i really wanna cut back and lose like ten pounds that's all i wanna do is just keep it where i was 

593.81 599.92 B: and one thing i read on the internet is that if you stop eating [noise] after a certain hour
