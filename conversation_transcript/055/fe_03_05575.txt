33.06 42.48 B: you know making sure my doors are locked and make sure my doors are closed i don't go in in a panic situation but i just double check and make sure everything's safe

57.19 58.40 B: so it's about 

57.51 62.48 A: yeah well i think i've been thinking i think anybody in the metropolitan area along the ah sea board 

61.95 63.42 B: right 

62.82 65.97 A: is a little bit more alert than ah than anybody else is 

66.39 67.49 B: right and 

66.65 75.54 A: but ah yeah i b- i mean i think i'm i'm not really i'm not really fearing like the ah like small stuff like i'm not fearing break ins or 

76.00 79.04 A: you know petty theft and i guess it's just more of a it's 

76.05 77.20 B: right 

79.15 82.84 A: more or less like the larger structures and stuff like that but 

83.33 86.51 A: i'm pr- pretty confident i have it under control what about you 

86.58 92.01 B: yeah yeah i'm pretty contr- i got it under control pretty well too and um 

92.20 99.84 B: you know i i go into the airport and um i've flown to new orleans and ah the security measures 

100.20 105.43 B: at the airports are are are very very tight right now 

105.47 111.25 B: and um that's but that's a little too extreme for me but um 

111.58 125.66 B: i guess that i just keep my doors doors closed a- and locked i don't have a security system in my house but i really don't feel it's necessary to have that but um i noticed the security 

125.59 127.53 B: around the um 

127.73 130.27 B: around the airports are very you know 

130.28 131.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

130.39 134.19 B: are very tight and ah i can understand why 

134.75 141.98 A: exactly yeah um i was i'm you know not not really on on on as much of a heightened alert um 

142.08 153.81 A: as like they trying to trying to make it out to be and with the whole like the whole idea of the changing the different colors um you know heightened you know red and you know we're on orange and 

154.07 162.13 A: (( um that's that's just kind of comes across as very political to me i don't really i don't really buy into that i'm not really worried about if i have to follow that um )) 

161.16 162.18 B: (( a- right )) 

162.37 166.40 A: but i mean it's 'cause there's not there's not a lot of explanation to back it up 

166.16 167.45 B: yeah i understand 

166.68 168.75 A: (( like like why is it going you know )) 

168.79 169.87 A: it just seems 

168.84 169.70 B: right 

169.89 177.27 A: and like now they've stopped doing it they've past all the 'cause they've obviously gonna realize that people got tired about it um but [laughter] 

177.32 190.90 B: well you laugh people are are um are getting tired of the the um different color alerts and stuff like that it's very repetitious and stuff like that and ah but 

177.69 178.49 A: (( um )) 

191.19 198.77 B: but i mean i am yeah security conscious to a point but i don't go overboard and ah 

198.90 201.79 B: that's it so are you calling from um 

201.83 205.52 B: a- a- anywhere in the east coast or i mean b- 

204.59 206.10 A: yeah i'm calling from new york 

205.79 208.07 B: oh you're closer to new york 

207.51 209.79 A: (( yeah manhattan that's correct )) 

208.71 210.26 B: oh you're in manhattan 

210.02 211.20 A: yeah 

210.59 214.04 B: right 'cause i go up to new york once in a while and i 

214.11 215.55 B: ah 

215.60 216.95 B: i um 

216.97 221.17 B: i ah travel up to new york and i notice up the tr- ah 

221.44 223.70 B: um that ah 

223.95 238.32 B: [mn] that the the people were really walking around in a daze after that had happened and for a long time and i kinda like could i was surprised to what i had seen it on on t._v. i had seen the people you know 

230.03 231.05 A: yeah 

238.28 240.74 B: packing and getting up you know 

240.89 243.63 B: and i mean they look like they were in shock 

243.91 254.07 B: and ah which which i it was ah very understanding so um but i know up in new york they have a lotta they're very security conscious up i- in new york 

254.47 256.31 B: i guess right r- 

254.61 255.56 A: right 

255.71 265.97 A: yeah that's the that's the case um but i think it like and it being like a core issue the people are constantly worried about just i mean people are not really rattled as much anymore 

265.61 266.72 B: right 

266.10 269.89 A: um and it and it seems pretty much back to normal after after a couple of months 

270.10 274.88 A: um but it's ah [laughter] i mean it's it's gotten you know progressively ah 

275.19 277.07 A: calmer ever since then 

276.77 278.06 B: right 

277.45 282.37 A: but ah yeah 'cause i mean i also think it's like it's s- kind of a tired issue at this point 'cause 

282.19 283.77 B: mhm 

282.77 292.78 A: um 'cause i mean there's so many things that's happened since then it it's not really the one thing that kind of like scarring people's memories i mean we're obviously kind of more aware of a whole 

293.02 297.68 A: kind of like m- the underlying movement that that provoked the attacks 

297.70 298.95 A: um 

297.72 298.58 B: right 

299.06 302.97 A: as w- as opposed to just like you know a few a few individuals 

303.36 304.53 A: um 

305.21 306.01 B: right 

305.25 308.93 A: but i i mean even now i mean even worse it's ah i mean it's 

309.56 312.11 A: the what i mean i think i think what 

312.23 319.58 A: the what what americans seem to realize that's it's a it's it's not gonna go away i mean i think the arab population is growing tremendously 

319.18 320.26 B: right 

319.70 326.36 A: um and and i mean and probably probably like in fifty years like southern europe will be a predominantly arab 

326.33 327.22 B: (( mm )) 

326.77 327.58 A: um 

327.75 334.39 A: area yeah just like just like you know i think the united states will be will become a hispanic country a- 

333.87 338.60 B: right ah right they think they're very cautious against 

334.83 336.04 A: years so be it 

338.87 342.10 B: a- a- people with ah um arabic 

342.21 350.62 B: ah descendants and stuff like that m- things like that and um but um i don't know it's not really 

344.78 345.67 A: uh-huh 

350.80 353.71 B: you know it's really not not really fair but um 

353.67 367.32 B: it's not like you e- e- it's s- not like world war two that you had everybody blacked out everything out and all and ah but a lotta people are are going to the extreme and they they put a big security system in 

367.76 368.91 A: right 

368.25 375.50 B: right but i just yeah i don't know if they um don't know if they did that up in new york a lot or not but ah 

376.01 378.06 B: like i said ah when i fly 

377.99 383.21 B: i fly i notice the security system is unbelievable 'cause you ha- 

383.15 394.77 B: you gotta take off your belt buckle i mean and they're very sensitive you have to carry your driver's license around a lot you have to show 'em w- before you get on the pl- ah i when you get your boarding pass 

390.21 391.18 A: yeah 

394.61 400.20 B: you have to show 'em before you get on the plane you have to show 'em when you're ready to um 

400.20 412.21 B: buy your ah ticket and stuff like that at the airport al- al- they're very very security conscious about the whole thing and i think [noise] ah and i think that ah
