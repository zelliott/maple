107.58 110.63 A: you wind up like some of these people you see walking the streets 

111.39 115.09 A: you know and uh the worse thing about it is uh the kids in school 

115.88 125.09 A: never get the exercise all they're doing is sitting down and watching t._v. and uh playing games and stuff and never get outside at all anymore 

120.74 121.73 B: well 

124.50 130.19 B: i think that's very very true uh it's very predominant in today's world in america 

129.58 130.43 A: yeah 

129.96 143.94 B: um you know we're we're very fortunate to in our family we just had a a grandson that finished up playing [noise] league baseball and i will take him golfing on friday for the first time this summer 

139.13 140.95 A: (( hm )) 

144.26 149.06 B: and we don't use a cart we walk to get whatever benefit we can you know 

148.67 156.34 A: uh-huh oh yeah we do the same thing [noise] too we wherever we go any place we try and park like a distance away so we get the walking in 

150.09 152.09 B: yeah and 

156.52 160.27 A: you know if i don't walk when it's uh hot outside like it is now 

160.56 163.45 A: we go to the mall or something we'll walk around the mall yah 

162.77 168.95 B: yeah er i i wish i could discipline myself to do that but so far i haven't but uh 

169.03 180.73 B: uh you know uh i i do a lot of things like when i go to a mall or or to a a store or anything i'll park my car all as far away from the door as i can 

180.43 181.55 A: yeah 

181.00 189.24 B: and i do that summer and winter and that's specifically so i can get that three four hundred yards whatever it is you know 

188.26 189.19 A: (( [noise] yeah mm )) 

189.29 193.91 A: yeah well i guess it's not how much you do it's how often you do it too you know and uh 

193.32 205.87 B: yeah well uh a lot of us can't do you know twenty minutes at a time uh three times a week but we do other things and and my thought is any thing you do [noise] is better than nothing 

198.63 199.47 A: yeah 

202.60 203.39 A: (( oh yeah )) 

205.51 217.47 A: yeah see i i can't do a lot of them things you know because of the heart and uh and with the angina i get so the walking i can do you know it doesn't bother me so i i go about maybe one two three miles a day 

208.79 209.90 B: yeah 

217.34 218.88 B: oh that's good 

218.30 222.14 A: and i do about uh maybe three four times a week 

222.24 223.02 B: i 

222.38 225.52 A: plus in between you know you get all that walking that you do too 

225.10 231.13 B: sure i think that's excellent uh i think that's a great regimen if you can follow it you know 

227.40 228.36 A: (( mhm )) 

230.11 236.41 A: yeah uh oh yeah you know see [laughter] you have no choice some times you have to [laughter] you know to keep kicking you

236.90 238.60 A: know anyway it's uh 

238.92 243.39 A: it's just too bad that they don't have some kind of fitness thing for these kids in school today 

245.22 248.59 A: (( you know i know they have [noise] something [noise] but [noise] i don't think they have enough ))

266.49 267.36 A: yeah 

269.74 274.36 A: yeah well i think most of the kids that are in sports in school get plenty of exercises 

274.72 284.24 A: but i mean i'm talking about the kids that don't get any kind of sports or anything like that i mean uh what kind of exercise are you to get by sitting in a car or like i say go home and watch television you
