6.83 8.09 B: (( yeah )) 

7.47 9.39 A: (( terrence sorry how are you )) 

9.04 10.18 B: i'm okay 

10.23 16.08 A: so what's our topic how is uh what changes in our lives have we made since september eleventh 

12.70 13.50 B: (( how do )) 

14.18 15.49 B: (( nine nine eleven )) 

16.01 21.33 B: um i guess everybody's a little more cautious now since the uh terrorist attacks 

21.92 24.98 B: i can't say i made any direct changes to say 

26.33 27.47 B: what about you 

26.34 27.23 A: right 

27.58 38.59 A: um well i don't think i've made any changes in my lifestyle i guess uh [mn] we're all aware of the differences that i guess have um 

39.81 47.57 A: [lipsmack] how how it's impacted upon our lives i mean if you try and travel now i mean you go through an airport and you have the heightened security 

45.93 48.85 B: well yes it's much more difficult now but 

48.20 51.17 A: exactly there's always uh uh 

51.67 53.91 A: there's always a lot more um 

54.28 57.04 A: time that you have to invest in going anywhere 

57.23 62.78 A: um did you know anyone who was in the uh trade center at the time 

61.95 63.24 B: oh no 

63.16 64.03 A: yeah 

63.41 64.36 B: no one 

64.10 67.46 A: well i guess you were fortunate i think that most people 

67.54 79.30 A: knew someone or knew someone who knew someone i actually had a uh friend whose boyfriend was in the building at the time and they never found any part of him but you know he was 

71.74 72.55 B: right 

76.23 77.25 B: (( okay i )) 

78.20 82.04 B: actually had a friend but she didn't go to work that day so [laughter] 

82.05 83.97 B: i guess that was very lucky 

82.08 83.46 A: she's fortunate 

83.96 86.27 A: she was fortunate i suppose 

85.43 86.90 B: yeah 

86.54 87.70 A: um 

87.97 93.30 A: the office that i was in i mean somebody must've heard it um 

93.33 95.45 A: on the radio or 

95.54 104.66 A: i believe must've looked at some website with uh for news and heard about it and they flipped on the t._v. and we could see the uh 

100.03 101.46 B: (( mhm right right )) 

105.43 112.51 A: the tower burning already and then you were watching the news and all of sudden they're talking about a plane crashing into 

112.31 113.26 B: i know 

112.53 119.79 A: the trade center and i thought it was they were replaying it and all the and but it was live and it was the second airplane coming in 

119.49 123.76 B: it was crazy right it was like something out of a movie at first when i saw it i was like 

123.82 125.42 B: doesn't even look real 

125.19 127.51 A: that's true i think that uh 

128.23 135.66 A: that hollywood i mean they they have all these films uh big blockbuster films and i think a lot of people get ideas 

135.40 137.12 B: i guess so yeah 

136.04 140.85 A: from uh what they see on t._v. and and in the the films these days 

141.25 142.94 B: (( [noise] i guess that's right )) 

141.34 142.68 A: a little crazy 

143.46 144.78 A: but uh 

145.07 146.41 A: yeah changes 

146.97 148.22 A: i haven't made any 

148.57 149.27 A: (( people )) 

149.88 152.88 A: they're more concerned about which countries they travel to 

152.95 155.38 B: mhm that's right that's also true i 

153.27 154.25 A: uh 

154.94 158.21 A: but personally it hasn't uh 

157.54 162.79 B: guess it reduced some travel on a whole most people just are afraid to travel by plane 

163.92 167.33 A: i still think it's probably the safest method [noise] of travel 

168.11 168.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

168.75 172.60 A: (( i think that i mean when your number's up there's not a lot you can do about it )) 

171.94 176.76 B: [noise] exactly and there's no sense in harming the entire industry 

177.25 180.60 B: 'cause it can happen anywhere it doesn't only have to happen on planes 

181.37 185.26 A: right so i don't think this is a great topic for people who 

185.41 186.98 A: changes in their lives 

185.98 188.79 B: no i think it's a strange topic they chose 

188.55 190.21 A: well i think 

189.29 194.32 B: though it can be very emotional fortunately both have no direct experiences with it 

193.52 199.45 A: yeah exactly exactly did uh [mn] is this your first conversation in this thing 

198.29 202.71 B: no it's the second actually i spoke to one guy yesterday about sports [noise] [noise] [noise] 

202.10 210.92 A: yes i did the same thing i actually caught a woman i thought it was like uh i for some reason i thought it was just men in the study but 

209.72 211.32 B: (( mhm one second )) 

213.38 215.29 B: yeah mhm 

215.36 216.89 A: you with me or are you on 

216.13 217.77 B: (( yeah i'm with you yeah [noise] )) 

216.91 219.98 A: okay i didn't know if you were uh taking another call 

220.31 222.17 A: so the uh 

222.70 227.51 A: yeah so we got a lot of time to kill i think we've been on the phone maybe four minutes 

227.86 230.78 A: they're gonna kill us we got six more minutes to fill 

230.47 232.51 B: [noise] mhm [laughter] 

232.41 238.16 A: they're gonna say you didn't fulfil the requirement talking about uh how it's changed your lives 

237.74 239.37 B: (( that's right [mn] i )) 

238.77 242.79 A: but unfortunately if it hasn't changed your life there's not a lot you can say 

241.83 246.51 B: guess it has affected me in one way though because i'm into aviation that's my 

246.74 248.60 B: that's my um job 

248.59 249.57 A: oh really 

249.00 258.95 B: and it has made the industry a lot more difficult to get into because i'm still at college right now and trying to get into it i have one more semester to go and 

259.08 263.93 B: prior to nine eleven i had done like three internships at the airport at j._f._k. 

263.57 264.72 A: right 

264.11 267.19 B: right now it's im- impossible to even get one 

267.21 268.14 A: uh-huh 

267.38 270.28 B: plus also i got a pa- a part time job there 

270.13 274.48 A: now [mn] and and what do you want to do in the industry do you want to fly or 

273.65 276.15 B: no i i'm doing airport management 

275.58 277.38 A: uh-huh i see 

278.23 285.73 A: and and it's difficult because of the screening process or i see are you from a different country are you nationality 

280.99 282.79 B: yeah 

284.09 285.49 B: yeah i am yeah 

286.00 286.98 A: and 

286.20 290.74 B: it's not just that it's just like the airlines don't have enough money to hire anyone right now 

290.06 291.30 A: oh i see 

290.91 292.79 B: (( they're at a standstill right now )) 

291.97 294.83 A: so it's not the screening process per se 

294.18 302.35 B: well it's partly that because there's so much stuff to go through that they limit almost everybody like one or two candidates may qualify 

302.49 304.24 A: are you a u._s. citizen 

303.73 305.10 B: yeah 

305.07 310.86 A: so i mean everybody comes from somewhere this being united states is a melting pot nobody's uh 

309.97 311.79 B: right especially new york 

311.28 318.85 A: exactly it's not like uh you can say i mean it's rare that you find somebody that's been here for generations and generations 

319.05 320.32 A: but uh 

321.01 326.45 A: well i wish you luck with that hopefully something will turn up where you can apply uh 

322.85 324.43 B: (( yeah i hope i hope so )) 

326.04 331.11 B: i really hope so i hope the entire industry has a turnaround a big turnaround 

326.53 328.34 A: your studies to a 

330.56 340.08 A: mhm well i'm trying to buy a ticket last minute and it seems like tickets aren't always that cheap just trying to buy an airline ticket at the last 

337.54 338.75 B: no because 

339.02 341.84 B: yeah and all the airlines need to make money now so 

341.51 343.18 A: yeah yeah 

342.16 344.45 B: no more breaks like they used to 

344.15 353.44 A: and i i we- i hesitated last week my friend found a a good two hundred and seventy five dollar air fare out of la guardia going to phoenix 

353.08 354.10 B: okay 

354.12 360.19 A: and i didn't do it and now if i look at it like three eighty six 

356.98 359.15 B: (( [noise] now you're paying like double the price )) 

359.56 360.94 B: mhm 

360.32 363.68 A: and you know for that extra hundred i'll probably postpone 

363.83 365.23 A: rather than uh 

365.70 367.77 A: than pay the extra money 

367.23 368.55 B: right 

368.21 376.71 A: plus that was through like what is it hot wire or whatever hot wire i think it's that site and they don't even tell you what airline and if you're going to have a stop or not 

371.46 372.33 B: (( mhm )) 

376.06 377.55 B: [laughter] 

376.92 384.06 A: but i figured at two seventy five you know i'd live with it but at three eighty six i'm not buying that ticket 

383.69 384.90 B: right right 

384.30 386.01 A: doesn't make any sense 

386.14 396.30 A: yeah it's an interesting i mean i never even heard of hot wire my friend who's anxious to get me to go visit her she was hunting trying to find me a good air fare and she came up with that 

395.12 396.27 B: oh okay 

397.38 398.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

397.57 402.01 A: but all right i think we got four more minutes to fill 

401.88 403.95 B: we can talk it out 

403.36 407.63 A: yeah i think they said they want you to talk for eight minutes before they uh 

407.91 409.76 A: before switching topics 

410.25 413.34 A: so where are you from originally if you don't mind my asking 

411.95 412.72 B: (( [laughter] )) 

413.04 414.85 B: originally from trinidad 

414.24 417.23 A: (( uh-huh trinidad and tobago i haven't )) 

415.85 417.81 B: mhm are you familiar with it 

417.25 424.57 A: no i there was a woman who worked in an office where i was a number of years ago and she was from tobago 

424.32 425.41 B: (( oh okay )) 

425.11 429.30 A: and um she was real cute i would have liked to have visited her 

428.82 430.45 B: oh you would love it there 

430.21 431.89 A: yeah she uh 

431.70 433.92 B: it's free of terrorism [laughter] 

433.24 442.02 A: is it it's just morally it's just like uh yeah trinidad is is big compared to tobago right yeah she was from tobago i think her family had 

433.96 435.00 B: yeah 

438.42 439.62 B: yeah 

442.45 444.58 A: some kind of bed and breakfast 

444.32 447.01 B: oh okay like most of the families over there 

444.78 445.64 A: and 

446.47 449.75 A: is that how it works a lot of tour- are they all in the tourism business 

447.40 448.21 B: (( yeah it's )) 

448.25 451.51 B: just like a basic tiny little tourism island 

450.94 451.83 A: uh-huh 

452.86 461.45 A: [lipsmack] well yeah i would have like to uh it's always nice to meet people from different countries get close to them and then go visit them 

457.76 458.68 B: always 

459.16 460.04 B: mhm 

460.88 464.53 B: of course free free free accommodation mhm 

461.62 463.07 A: [laughter] 

463.86 468.85 A: yeah yeah that's part of the reason why i my friend uh 

469.00 479.74 A: is pushing me to visit her in arizona and i'm like uh i- it's no so easy but i want to go because you know she's offering i got a place to stay and i've never been to arizona 

479.34 480.66 B: right 

480.25 488.64 A: it's supposed to be beautiful so but it's really hot right now and she s- says there's no humidity but she's had days when it's like a hundred and ten 

488.10 489.34 B: oh no 

489.06 493.96 A: yeah i mean you think new well new york is uncomfortable i can't stand the humidity 

492.73 501.26 B: [noise] i know i know exactly how you feel during the summer here i feel like dying every day it's so sticky it's so hot i feel exhausted [noise] 

500.66 510.55 A: yeah it's it's not good i mean you step outside you have to you have to get into the subway you're de- i mean and then you start seeing the guys with the machine guns i mean that i 

509.95 514.26 B: i know that's since nine eleven they've been in every major subway stop 

513.68 519.57 A: that that's the one thing that like really affected me the most perhaps 'cause i hadn't 

517.31 518.49 B: (( yeah it makes )) 

518.52 523.30 B: me want to not take the subway any more 'cause i usually travel on the a train 

522.71 524.20 A: right 

523.67 531.40 B: and i mean like every a train station these guys are there with these guns that are bigger than me and it's it's kind of scary 

529.12 530.01 A: yeah 

531.09 536.64 A: i saw it at west fourth street at that stop that's the first time i really noticed the the guys in the subway 

536.17 537.65 B: mhm 

537.04 539.17 A: i hadn't been the subway in a while 

538.81 541.16 B: okay no i take it like almost every day 

541.08 543.34 A: yeah well if i can avoid it 

542.17 547.76 B: and they always say that that's the next thing the terrorists are going to attack so it has you kind of like in fear 

548.35 551.13 B: i remember like a couple of days after the attacks 

551.64 560.15 B: that we just think oh they're going to do the a tra- for some reason they always choose the a train which is my train and i was like oh my gosh why are they doing this 

556.57 557.61 A: mhm 

560.02 565.15 A: mm yeah well everybody starts talking about it they say watch out for this i had a friend and she heard it 

565.13 574.36 A: was a holiday weekend i think it was memorial day weekend and she said that she heard from her friend who worked in hillary hillary clinton's office 

574.34 586.20 A: that despite the fact that he hadn't heard anything about it we were really at a heightened alert and that they thought that something was going to happen in new york city and she was trying to tell me to get out of the city 

580.60 581.44 B: right 

586.31 592.85 A: and i'm like well i'm just going to stay here i mean i'm not travelling anywhere it just and nothing happened and there was nothing 

589.40 590.94 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

591.85 599.89 B: i know i think the news also it kinda hypes the situation up a little bit too much it makes people kind of paranoid and afraid
