147.22 161.29 B: [lipsmack] as far as a spectator sport i love football and uh baseball and basketball but playing it's a uh it's it's easiest for me just to play basketball it's just you know a matter of where and you know it's just easy access 

152.97 154.06 A: yeah 

161.16 162.03 A: uh-huh 

161.76 163.28 B: (( um [lipsmack] ))

195.51 197.02 B: [laughter] 

196.32 199.52 A: so [sigh] um but i'll find somewhere 

199.87 207.46 B: i'm sure you could join some club there but i understand that new york's clubs are pretty expensive that's what i understand 

205.29 211.18 A: yeah my room mates just joined um one's joined crunch which is i guess is a national 

210.89 213.04 B: yeah i've heard of it 

211.26 212.37 A: (( um gym )) 

212.49 219.14 A: and that's seventy five a month out here and then the other one joined um another gym that's only twenty five 

219.17 221.23 B: uh twenty five's not too bad at all 

219.44 223.25 A: so but no and they have like classes and everything so 

223.56 224.62 A: um 

225.12 229.34 A: i don't know i could certainly can find once i get on my feet over here 

229.73 233.51 A: twenty five a month is really affordable for working out [noise] 

233.29 234.97 B: that's not too bad 

234.36 238.43 A: otherwise um i'm promising to myself that when i get up 

238.58 245.04 A: 'cause i'm an early riser so um that's not a bad time to go for a two or three mile jog 

245.32 246.01 B: that 

245.38 249.25 A: that usually makes me feel like i'm doing something you know 

249.22 250.33 B: that is true 

250.28 251.86 A: what about your diet 

252.10 254.58 B: uh diet i 

255.48 258.03 B: that's something i need to improve um 

257.17 258.10 A: yeah 

258.31 262.19 B: [lipsmack] i mean actually i don't eat much sweets or 

262.35 275.12 B: uh or alcohol or smoke or anything um but as far as like eating enough vegetables and fruits i'm a little lacking there um but i d- uh i do try to uh 

266.19 267.26 A: mhm 

271.85 273.01 A: yeah 

275.57 282.02 B: to watch a little bit of m- like i don't eat much fried fried food and stuff so i try to watch a little bit of what i eat 

282.20 284.02 A: yeah 

282.90 293.80 B: but uh overall i could probably pay a little more attention to the to the fruits and vegetables just uh i live on my own you know uh on my own 

290.29 291.25 A: yeah 

293.82 294.50 B: (( so )) 

294.94 300.45 B: i have to really be careful what i buy or else it goes bad you know just that the produce goes bad really fast 

297.98 299.80 A: yeah 

300.05 301.22 A: how old are you 

301.07 302.31 B: twenty seven 

302.40 303.97 A: okay i'm twenty two 

304.04 305.09 A: um 

305.84 310.12 A: yeah i would thin- i think have you always lived in boston 

310.58 315.47 B: um well i grew up here but i went to school out in california 

312.41 313.25 A: yeah 

313.89 318.74 A: okay do you think eating habits and health habits are different like in different places 

320.40 323.74 B: um i would say more so 

324.59 327.03 B: you know back fr- when i was in college 

326.79 327.66 A: (( uh-huh )) 

327.37 336.44 B: uh 'cause when i was in california it seemed like it seemed like the health trend the health craze was really strong in california but now 

336.64 339.66 B: it's just as strong here it seems 

338.49 339.85 A: mhm 

339.74 340.83 B: um 

341.33 344.70 B: so yeah when i was back in college like ten or almost ten years ago 

346.02 347.19 B: um 

348.19 352.46 B: when i first started there yeah i could s- i could see a difference 

352.36 353.66 A: yeah 

353.03 356.59 B: um people in california at least where i was at 

356.66 363.20 B: you know were more on top of eating like vege- there were a lot more vegetarians that i came across 

362.80 363.91 A: mhm 

363.30 377.74 B: um even a lot of vegans and but then as soon as i you know like for bread and circus type stores here really grew and and became you know like the more popular places to go for food and stuff so 

378.30 384.29 A: yeah i definitely grew i'm from chicago like i said so if you know anything about the mid west like 

384.65 392.37 A: they're typically it's um a place of bad health lots of gluttony and like fried foods and meats and 

392.45 405.04 A: like my diet has changed just moving from there to new york because there's a different sort of consciousness of our health here and it exists in chicago and more more than ever now than before but 

399.52 400.69 B: mhm 

405.07 415.99 A: like it's easy to get off track in a town like chicago where like the recreation is like still based on restaurants and bars and stuff [noise] 

413.58 415.05 B: (( mhm in )) 

416.39 418.99 A: but um 

418.58 424.24 B: new york you have i mean right outside your door probably you have like any kind of food that you want 

424.54 430.22 A: yeah it's it's as long as you're in manhattan pretty much i live in brooklyn so i live in like a 

424.63 426.92 B: it's so accessible 

430.65 444.10 A: um pretty puerto rican neighborhood and everything is just like every corner store is just like kind of the same like they're all just kind of the same groceries but like you know all i have to do is take the train over and i could find anything 

433.01 433.96 B: okay 

439.86 440.83 B: okay 

445.54 446.77 A: (( um do )) 

447.10 449.21 A: you guys have whole foods out there 

449.27 457.30 B: yeah well bread and circus and whole food actually uh they're they're changing i guess whole foods is the 

458.09 461.66 B: i think i believe it's whole foods or wh- yeah whole foods is like the big 

461.79 470.60 B: parent company and the store is in this area it used to be called bread and circus but in the last couple of months as kind of a national branding campaign 

462.85 464.07 A: mhm 

470.70 477.05 B: they've changed all those to whole foods market or whatever the parent company is called 

477.21 479.64 A: uh-huh i see [noise] yeah whole foods is 

478.04 480.89 B: so yeah we we have them 

479.96 482.39 A: a pretty new thing to chicago 

482.65 487.30 A: uh it seems like everything like moves from the coast inwards 

487.08 488.44 B: yeah i 

487.14 498.32 A: like we're always we're always the last ones to get everything [noise] 'cause my east coast friends would always be like oh whole foods like yeah we've had that for about ten years [laughter] they've just built it you know in chicago a couple of years ago 

494.90 496.10 B: [laughter] 

498.62 509.36 B: uh since i mean i've always heard of the new trends and fads start on the west coast and then it sounds like maybe they jump here and then kind of you know kind of go back 

503.40 504.48 A: yeah 

507.69 512.61 A: yeah i've i'm i know not too much about the west coast where did you go to school out there 

512.64 514.90 B: near l._a. it's called pepperdine 

514.73 515.65 A: okay 

515.90 520.95 A: yeah i've been out to l._a. and san diego just once like years ago 

521.42 522.34 A: so 

522.56 533.83 A: i don't really have a good feeling out there but yeah i have that that like image of people that are super health conscious and to the point of flaking that's about it 

533.49 534.77 B: yes [laughter] 

534.79 535.94 A: um 

534.82 535.98 B: that is true 

536.18 542.18 A: it is it's good here i think it's like a nice mix of people in new york where they're health conscious enough 

542.35 544.95 A: but not like overly so 

545.31 546.29 A: although 

546.59 550.03 A: my gauging of the situation is like i just moved here a few weeks ago so 

550.63 553.72 B: another good store is called trader joe's do you know those 

553.09 555.79 A: yeah yeah that's moved into chicago too 

555.79 556.75 B: [laughter] 

556.82 558.21 B: gee chicago 

557.16 560.49 A: i like trader joe it has a good sort of wine selection 

560.51 561.89 B: (( yeah it's a good place )) 

561.81 563.21 A: you don't drink at all 

562.89 564.29 B: no i don't 

563.65 564.48 A: (( no )) 

564.56 566.43 A: did did you ever drink 

566.04 566.80 B: no 

566.86 569.53 B: no no never have i mean i've uh 

569.61 573.86 B: occasionally um like my girlfriend and i go out to like a tapas bar 

573.71 574.56 A: uh-huh 

573.97 584.02 B: we might split a sangria um and uh very rarely we'll split like a glass of red wine at an italian restaurant but no i'm not much into the bar scene at all 

575.91 576.96 A: yeah 

583.86 590.71 A: [noise] yeah um what do you think of the whole a beer a day or a a glass of wine a day 

584.06 584.77 B: (( no )) 

590.86 591.87 A: theory 

591.94 595.80 A: that because it's said to have like help your blood stream and help your 

596.15 599.76 A: heart and your overall health if you just have one drink a day
