110.80 120.60 A: yeah man i know what you're saying i mean it's kind of been that way in my life too i mean it's weird i used to spend a lot of time in new york and it took me a long time after that to go back 

120.29 121.32 B: yeah 

120.73 125.67 A: um a lot of people i knew who were um 

125.90 126.46 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

126.49 128.50 A: involved in 

130.23 145.07 A: um different different things in new york uh different businesses in new york and knew people in new york uh knew that that had died or lost friends there uh a lot of stuff happened that way but like me personally 

145.13 150.40 A: beside uh actually i've lost two jobs since there too [laughter] um 

148.41 152.11 B: yeah it's been been a rough it's been a rough call but 

151.38 155.50 A: yeah i mean and and the first one was a diff- a direct 

155.69 157.91 A: um a direct 

157.98 161.81 A: result of that i was working two jobs as a part timer 

161.84 167.76 A: um but when that happened and the one job i knew wasn't gonna last but the summer 

167.80 171.23 A: but the other job i had um 

172.77 187.60 A: [sigh] lasted in fact until december and then they were like okay well you know we want the job full time but meanwhile the guy was like cutting and slashing and cutting and slashing and all these improvements he said he was gonna make to the business he didn't make 

187.49 195.79 A: so i started really worrying [laughter] and of course you know he let one guy go and i'd only been there four months when he let this guy go 

195.99 202.92 A: and i started thinking you know worrying that i was gonna get it too i just hoping that i could make it to september of that year 

203.20 206.74 A: and i couldn't i mean i got got whacked in july 

207.01 208.70 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

207.88 210.78 A: you know i was out of work until december 

211.09 215.31 A: and i got a job in december and i just got whacked two weeks ago 

216.21 217.71 B: that's a shame man 

217.47 219.75 A: yeah it's really is a shame 

220.46 221.34 A: (( uh )) 

220.50 228.00 B: you just wondering when things are gonna get better i mean for the last what this is like the third year now and it's you know it's been pretty pretty crappy 

225.22 226.37 A: right 

227.40 231.90 A: i'm thinking it's not gonna get better i mean you know not not with your 

231.15 238.12 B: well you know what it it always gets better it's just like how far how far do we gotta sink before thing do get better you know 

237.59 242.87 A: yeah well i'm worried about that i i think we've still got a ways to sink i mean 

243.30 249.27 A: [sigh] i mean as long as there's people still employed there's people that can lose their jobs and that's a scary thing 

247.51 248.41 B: yeah 

249.31 263.01 A: 'cause there's already and and of course where i live there's there's all kinds it's really hard to get unemployment compensation you'd think it'd be easy considering you're paying into it but they you know they put all kinds of all kinds of roadblocks and obstacles in front of you 

262.95 270.14 B: oh well you know they're they're pilfering the social security system that's why there's no money there 'cause they're stealing it all 

266.61 267.78 A: (( oh yeah )) 

269.49 271.29 A: yeah yeah 

270.59 276.59 B: now that i i don't wanna be negative about the whole thing but i guess you can tell i'm kind of a skeptic 

276.45 281.10 A: well i'm [laughter] i'm i think i'm probably worse than you are [laughter] as far as 

279.56 287.88 B: i just see all this crap going on and it's like you know this is this is our government for us steal- stealing from the poor to make themselves richer 

284.28 285.53 A: yeah right 

286.31 290.18 A: yeah well look at look at look that tax cut they pulled 

290.45 291.55 A: (( i mean that that's )) 

290.77 292.86 B: oh did they actually pass that 

292.19 294.36 A: yeah it's been passed 

294.40 300.62 A: i mean it's you know the [laughter] the vast majority of the people who are profiting and not only 

300.50 312.52 A: from the the rich but not only are the are the rich getting you know really hit off because of that but then they they tom delay another guy from texas unfortunately um 

311.47 320.34 B: i believe you know my politics my politics here are not really well taken by average texans 'cause i'm not from texas originally 

312.95 313.71 A: when 

316.90 318.18 A: (( i bet )) 

319.14 321.62 A: yeah yeah 

320.74 324.53 B: so i come i'm i'm from uh i'm from yankee country 

323.83 326.08 A: yeah i can kinda tell 

324.62 337.81 B: and uh where it's a little bit more liberal and uh it's just like this is like a uh a ultra right wing haven down here for all these like uh ultra conservatives love love texas 

327.35 328.34 A: yeah 

332.79 333.68 A: yeah 

337.14 338.40 A: (( yeah i bet )) 

338.43 340.57 B: and so i i don't 

338.91 342.52 A: well they like you know they like killing people down there [laughter] i 

343.42 345.77 A: mean the guys are the law you know 

345.31 346.81 B: (( i know mhm )) 

346.41 354.21 A: but yeah i mean you know delay was like um trying to what happened was was that this part of this aspect of the cut 

354.19 365.49 A: um was not extended to a whole lot of people that made between fifteen and twenty five thousand and uh tom delay was like so what the hell with them basically that's what he said 

365.95 376.31 A: you know like they're not paying taxes anyway [laughter] why should they get the benefit you know this is i and and i i just can't believe that people like this are allowed to just you know 

376.00 379.01 B: yeah i think i think it's time for a revolution 

378.70 381.70 A: oh yeah change a regime change 

379.74 382.83 B: it's just how you gonna pull it off nowadays you know 

382.22 385.00 A: regime change like george bush always says 

385.06 387.53 A: i think we need regime change right here 

386.79 398.92 B: oh [mn] yeah yeah that whole bi- that whole thing was a sham what what we went into iraq for it had nothing to do with iraqi freedom or weapons of mass discussion or destruction it's [sigh] 

392.50 393.34 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

399.94 404.87 B: they have their own little age- agenda that they don't want us to deal you know they think we're 

405.00 408.13 B: too we're not knowledgeable enough to deal with so 

407.29 409.63 A: that was that was all about oil 

409.87 416.38 B: uh about oil about the fact that george was upset his father had never finished never finished the job and 

414.38 415.41 A: right 

415.52 416.96 A: right 

416.51 425.54 B: and uh a- actually it's probably turn out that george junior never finished the job because he went in their to get saddam and guess what saddam's still around 

424.63 428.28 A: well i'm telling you what what it's turning into is vietnam 

427.91 433.85 B: well there's more people getting killed now than there was when uh when they had the war going on 

431.19 432.13 A: right 

433.05 434.95 A: it's turning into vietnam 

434.67 436.01 B: yeah yeah

445.90 448.26 A: (( right i totally agree with that )) 

448.31 461.58 B: uh he he's he's gonna create something that uh like he's gonna create so much turmoil over there he's uh he's gonna give them every reason to give t- to attack us even more and like with terrorist stuff you know 

459.86 462.48 A: (( right well yeah i mean and you )) 

462.54 471.44 A: know i mean [sigh] the guy was over there getting you know one of the soldiers over there getting a pepsi and he was sitting down drinking it and some guy waltzed up and pops him in the head
