14.85 16.28 B: yeah where are you from 

16.44 21.44 A: uh down sunny south near the atlanta area well i'm actually in the atlanta metro area 

19.00 19.90 B: okay 

22.33 36.24 A: and it looks like our our subject matter was you know what kind of change have you made in your life since uh the nine eleven and uh kinda given me an idea since you were there and right you know close to it i would be really interested to uh hear your you know side of the story 

22.51 23.94 B: (( all right um [noise] )) 

37.20 52.02 B: i'll be honest with you i haven't made that many changes i didn't fly a lot before so i mean the only change i probably would've made was probably not flying as much if i had a job that required a lot of travel but day to day like living in manhattan 

52.29 54.41 B: i i don't think 

54.64 59.13 B: only after like maybe a couple of weeks right after the attacks 

59.27 68.26 B: i was just a little hesitant using the subway but act- since then i haven't really made day to day changes um i still go 

68.57 72.80 B: wherever i want um i used to live in brooklyn for a year 

73.15 74.19 B: and 

75.11 80.04 B: i would [noise] you know i there wasn't anything like any areas i avoided like bridges 

80.12 81.11 B: or 

81.17 87.24 B: tall buildings um i live in a relative i live in like a seventeen floor building 

87.59 97.63 B: and i don't go to work in like a huge building either so there's nothing [noise] there's no areas i avoid i go to times square if i want to [noise] 

97.61 103.63 B: i'll go [noise] baseball games i'll go wherever so hasn't really affected me i've been kind of 

104.68 107.56 B: numb because of all like the the warnings 

107.63 119.68 B: it seems like the government has kind of just put us in a state of like constant like anxiety but you don't really know what to do so 

119.87 125.89 B: it's a kind of i don't even know what i would do you know there's no it's just like here it is the terror 

126.05 137.69 B: l- level has been elevated to orange or burnt orange or red but they don't really tell you like what you should do i don't wear a mask i don't you know [noise] do much 

138.15 140.87 B: else so i haven't really changed that much 

141.98 149.87 A: well with me [noise] i'm a i travel quite a bit or in fact i travel extensively and uh i'm in corporate uh engineering and safety 

149.91 150.77 B: okay 

150.01 154.08 A: and i try to fly very little as i can and 

153.31 154.44 B: (( all right okay )) 

154.85 160.63 A: much that i'm afraid of the terrorists taking over the airplane as that i despise the uh 

160.66 167.81 A: the technique that they send you through taking off your shoes at the airport checking you over you know with a wand signalling you out if you have any metal on you 

163.66 165.02 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

167.83 168.89 A: and uh 

168.91 181.91 A: and then the uh the part that really irritates me is that there'll be a middle eastern person standing in front of you and they walk him right through they never even ask him any questions and then yet you come behind him and and i suppose i'm about as american looking as you can get you know 

181.37 183.71 B: (( mhm )) 

182.54 186.25 A: [noise] turn they'll shake you down they'll pat you down and make you take your shoes off 

186.36 190.12 B: so do you think they should profile certain 

186.42 187.19 A: and it 

190.31 196.80 A: irritates me no end i drive most of the time now and i have some i have some uh fears 

190.49 193.15 B: [noise] middle eastern people or [mn] 

196.83 205.90 A: going into some of the tunnels i i really do i went uh originally to uh chesapeake and i went through the chesapeake tunnel and i recently went through the baltimore tunnel 

203.61 204.43 B: (( uh-huh )) 

205.96 217.34 A: and i just [mn] and not i'm a fact that i'm afraid of dying it's just the fact that i could just you know visualize a bomb exploding in there and the tunnel caving in around you being trapped in there 

210.32 211.13 B: uh-huh 

217.41 218.35 A: and uh 

217.70 226.53 B: yeah [mn] i i did work like when i when september eleventh hit i was working in new jersey so i would go through the tunnel every day 

226.79 233.99 B: like the lincoln tunnel and i don't know i just never felt the big anxiety about it i just 

234.09 241.68 B: it i mean you would see a high a bigger police presence you'd see like [noise] you know and like the national guard with 

241.99 244.24 B: machine guns or whatever they were carrying 

244.59 254.02 B: and they're checking cars but you know it just seemed like even with all the precautions if somebody really wanted to do something 

254.38 264.20 B: you couldn't stop them totally like a and that i just kinda thought you know well if you if somebody was really that dead set on doing something 

266.11 270.35 B: i i mean you could just like kinda play the scenario in my head i was just like [noise] 

270.67 275.79 B: i think there would be a way i could get something through the tunnel but maybe i'm just being naive but [lipsmack] 

276.26 277.32 B: i think it wo- 

277.11 284.15 B: there there it i just didn't feel totally safe now i feel like new york is probably one of the safer places to be 

283.96 292.76 B: because you see just especially like on the fourth of july you would literally see just a bigger police presence you would see 

292.77 297.45 B: pol- you know national guard in the subway you'd see a lot more police 

297.55 301.65 B: and there's some things that i think kind of backfire because 

301.95 307.16 B: you put a nash- an armed guardsman down in the subway and then they get on the subway 

307.38 311.64 B: now usually there are two of them that would get on the subway car 

312.07 321.31 B: but what happens if one of them gets jumped and you know their weapon gets taken from them you know so i mean like it's kind of 

321.43 325.04 B: almost backfires a little bit 'cause that makes me feel more nervous 

326.03 338.61 B: but it's not going to stop me from using the subway because if i'm going downtown that's the easiest way i'm going to get downtown so [noise] it's just kind of like what's the alternative do i walk everywhere and you know 

338.58 345.66 B: leave that much more time to get someplace or do i take a cab and that's more of an expense to me i just it just doesn't seem 

345.69 348.24 B: reasonable to do anything differently 

348.67 349.94 B: for me [mn] 

350.05 359.66 A: [noise] well i had i changed quite a bit of my travel plans and i have a nine year old daughter and we had originally had planned to go up to washington d._c. and we had had been to washington before 

359.57 370.64 A: and my wife wanted to go back again and i told my wife i said you know do you and i i said i i wouldn't have any problem i said but my child i said if a terrorist was going to hit that would the first place they would probably hit would be one of the monuments 

370.68 378.59 A: or smithsonian or someplace with a huge number of people gathered and i told my wife i just don't think that i want to put my child at that kind of risk 

374.07 376.63 B: yeah i mean i would feel more nervous in 

378.36 383.41 B: right i would feel more nervous in washington because it's more of an open area there's 

383.45 397.67 B: a lot more ways to get in and out of the d._c. area there's a lot more targets 'cause it's just more spread out 'cause they can't build high rises [noise] like in new york i mean in manhattan it's so much more isolated like i feel more safer 

397.80 398.80 B: in 

399.07 405.62 B: the borough of manhattan than i would than i do in brooklyn because brooklyn is just so massive and there's so many 

405.83 408.67 B: kind of cracks where somebody could slip through 

408.77 416.56 B: or but manhattan just feels like you can in a way control it a little bit better than with some of the outer boroughs 

416.56 426.89 B: but it it i just still don't feel like totally protected you know and i don't think i'm every going to feel that way so 

427.52 438.59 B: and i don't know what i could do [mn] do you think there's something that you could personally to make yourself feel safe than o- other than not doing some of the things that you didn't that you did before 

438.86 447.79 A: [noise] no not really because you know terrorists with an objective you know always in hand is going to carry it out i mean his life means nothing to him or he wouldn't be strapping explosives to begin with 

447.77 448.72 B: (( right [noise] )) 

447.90 460.63 A: and uh that that's my thing you know these guys could walk right into a one of the museums in washington d._c. with you know twenty pounds of t._n._t. or c. four strapped to him set it off and i mean you're talking hundreds of people that would be killed if not thousands of people 

459.49 467.67 B: right are there places in atlanta that you don't go to like a a museum or a mm baseball game or something where there's large crowds 

467.63 475.94 A: yeah i don't feel threatened of going to a braves game i've been to braves games and i've been to the omni not the omni but the world congress center watch the play 

473.33 474.06 B: (( uh )) 

475.85 476.72 B: uh-huh 

475.91 485.00 A: and you know you when you walk in the place you're kinda looking around and i guess it's just it's just natural after nine eleven before i'd walk into the stadium i'd walk into the georgia dome 

484.77 493.54 A: and i have no problem going to a concert but now it seems like when i go into a place i'm looking around seeing like there are there any really suspicious people that are standing around 

484.83 485.74 B: right 

492.53 494.51 B: well what do you look for 

494.64 500.42 A: hah that i don't know that's that's the ten that's the sixty four thousand dollar question what am i looking for i don't know 

500.36 506.97 B: 'cause it i mean at least in new york there's so many nationalities represented and there's so many different people 

507.19 508.22 B: i mean 

509.21 510.41 B: to i 

509.39 520.57 A: i think probably it's just a phobia that has uh you know has come up since nine eleven that was probably never there or maybe some people has it that constantly walk around with the fear that somebody's going to attack them but 

520.35 522.61 B: it's just like a second look kind of [noise] 

521.88 526.40 A: (( this place that we go to i take my daughter with me and i i fear for her safety more so than mine )) 

526.07 539.24 B: [noise] mhm [noise] i got you i mean i guess the only thing that the only difference is maybe i take a second look at a person when i [noise] normally would just [noise] not and you know i don't even know what difference that would make but [noise] 

539.87 552.09 A: well my wife wants to go on a cruise and here again you know i'm i'm holding out and uh we had won a uh trip for uh anywhere we wanted to go with rich carlton anywhere in the world with air fare and everything four days and three nights 

543.62 545.03 B: [noise] yeah [noise] 

549.15 554.86 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

554.74 556.89 A: and went down to florida [noise] 

557.19 558.06 B: (( [noise] huh )) 

558.84 562.40 B: [noise] so w- what would [noise] make you start doing these things again 

562.82 570.88 A: [mn] i don't know that's that's the question you know that's what my wife ask makes it when are you going to get over this phobia of where you're afraid to go anywhere because of nine eleven 

568.43 575.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

574.00 576.63 A: that for and i'm i'm used to seeing guns in airports 

577.27 578.59 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

578.63 588.47 A: weapons hanging on their sides i mean that that part you know don't intimidate me but it's just the fact that you know i go somewhere with my daughter i guess it's just this perennial you know thing that 

585.71 594.34 B: (( mhm )) 

589.33 590.81 A: (( hard on your family )) 

592.89 599.89 A: question i i don't know you know that's a if i guess if if my my will to overrides my fear probably 

595.41 596.54 B: (( [noise] ))
