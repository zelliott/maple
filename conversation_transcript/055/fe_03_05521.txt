13.61 17.65 B: (( [sigh] so we're supposed to talk about health and fitness [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

15.63 16.93 A: yes please 

17.78 22.13 A: um now i i associate that with florida quite closely 

22.48 31.33 B: [laughter] uh it's a big boom in down here yeah [laughter] not that i partake too often i'm usually more i'm more of a subtle [mn] exerciser 

24.59 25.56 A: yes 

31.18 32.44 A: i see 

32.89 34.14 B: how about yourself 

33.69 37.41 A: well i i walk to the subway that's that's good experience 

36.80 39.15 B: [laughter] 

38.77 42.53 A: (( uh and and well i say i walk it's like a mile )) 

41.97 43.24 B: that's good [mn] 

43.10 49.94 A: modest exercise and then i belong to a gym um that my regularity of attending is is pretty small 

49.92 54.35 B: yeah i did for a while but then i realized that i wasn't using it so it wasn't worth the expense [mn] 

55.25 56.52 B: so uh 

57.45 59.67 B: but what's your what's your feeling on exercise 

59.84 61.64 A: well i mean it's not it's 

61.69 67.90 A: i mean i i know in my head that it's a very smart thing to do within within reasonable bounds 

67.94 76.38 A: i mean the the various medical studies show that modest exercise is good one doesn't have to do a huge amount to you know to the benefit 

74.61 75.57 B: yeah [noise] 

78.44 82.67 B: my honest concern is that when you go to a gym you feel like you should've been should've been there for six months but 

82.81 87.55 B: [laughter] you don't do it and then you don't do it and then you get even fur- farther behind [laughter] 

88.10 92.78 A: uh do do you get that feeling because you look around at other people and they're all in such great shape 

92.32 93.63 B: yeah [laughter] 

94.24 96.26 B: it's like you have to be fit to go to the gym 

96.20 109.60 A: i well okay maybe i maybe i go to the right kind of gym i mean that in the sense that i don't feel threatened that way i mean obviously people are a lot better shape than i am but i but there are people who are less good shape and so that's that's fine 

102.44 103.77 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

110.61 115.56 A: um it you know it's it's not a very crowded gym that's another one of its nice features [noise] 

114.94 119.85 B: oh that's good so is it attached to a hospital or a y. or something or is it privately 

119.29 122.95 A: no it's just it's just on top of a office building 

122.34 123.69 B: oh that's cool 

123.02 124.54 A: so it has a nice view 

125.47 128.28 B: [mn] so what do you think's stopping you from going to the gym 

128.45 130.14 B: more regularly 

129.77 137.95 A: [laughter] taking that step and going you know you know it's time out of the day it's how do you find time for these things 

137.63 139.04 B: are you married 

138.65 139.61 A: yes 

139.17 146.69 B: does your wife go to the gym wow see my wife [laughter] she wasn't an early morning person so it was hard to find time 

140.31 141.33 A: yes 

146.72 152.71 A: (( so so your your your your wife does giving you doubt is that what you're saying )) 

150.66 151.40 B: she 

151.94 156.12 B: well she no she w- when we did she unfortunately she's not a very good morning person 

156.28 164.54 B: and i'm more of a morning person so if i and she didn't like to go after work sometimes so and of course by the time you finish your day you're like okay i just wanna go home or i just wanna go and have a beer somewhere 

165.26 166.33 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

165.59 167.21 B: so that was the uh 

168.44 171.79 B: that wasn't exactly the most encouraging [laughter] 

171.39 176.67 A: yeah i'm trying to place your accent england okay what what part of england 

173.40 175.93 B: england yeah [lipsmack] 

176.28 178.05 B: north east [noise] 

177.49 178.59 A: (( oh okay )) 

179.50 182.63 B: so uh so is it on top of your office building or is it 

182.05 185.14 A: (( no no it's it's a an office building near )) 

185.27 186.66 A: near my home 

186.05 187.04 B: oh okay [laughter] 

187.75 190.31 A: (( half a mile three quarters of a mile from my house so )) 

190.08 192.82 B: so is it near your subway station [mn] 

192.01 195.24 A: yeah it's on route to the subway station so it's a very good plan to you know 

195.28 199.70 A: walk there exercise and and hop on the subway 

200.59 202.13 A: very great idea yeah 

201.58 202.21 B: [sigh] 

202.59 204.40 A: i shouldn't have to plan on 

203.91 207.77 B: [laughter] yeah 

206.87 211.66 A: it of course one of the complications of that is that then you have to carry your gym clothes 

212.20 218.30 A: all around to your office and you you have to carry your office clothes to the gym and 

217.99 220.41 B: yeah i guess if you take the subway that's a bit more 

219.94 224.44 A: no this is just sort of like whining and fussing and it's really like this is no good excuse for not exercising 

223.89 230.71 B: [laughter] well i'm sure we could all think of about four or five that we can all come up with they they may not be valid but they sound good at the moment 

230.97 234.82 B: (( [sigh] yeah i don't know if it's it's just i don't know i mean it's )) 

235.05 245.61 B: my my biggest problem is i have arthritis in some of my joints so if i ov- my tendency is i'll go try and go gung ho and then i'll end up hurting myself and then i'll take six months off and then you know you're back at square one again 

240.72 241.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

243.97 248.10 A: oh yeah oh you you must be in terrible i mean that must be awful 

247.54 248.78 B: yeah s- 

248.87 252.41 B: but it's als- it's also a good excuse sometimes when you don't wanna work out 

251.87 261.00 A: i yeah i know people who r- exercise regularly and when and when they miss one day out of their regular schedule they they say they feel it on the day that they return that they know the absence 

259.14 260.14 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

261.53 262.83 A: um 

263.88 268.73 A: i i also feel that that it helps if if it's a fun experience 

268.93 272.39 A: part a a social kind of experience 

271.91 273.11 B: yeah 

272.48 278.64 A: if there was somebody else who cared like if like if you were on a a sports team of some sort i mean no matter how 

279.13 282.75 A: how amateurish if there was so- if there's some activity like that then 

283.51 286.71 A: other people were counting on you to be there well then you'd be there 

286.54 292.87 B: yeah i think it's true 'cause yeah the more the team thing seemed to be more and it's not just the same exer- it's not just exercise for the exercise itself 

292.40 296.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

295.64 297.06 B: is that your p._c. 

296.36 301.31 A: no that was my my computer telling me about something that's gonna happen in in um ten minutes 

300.83 302.97 B: oh okay [laughter] 

303.35 304.96 B: you can't miss that one can you 

304.83 308.00 A: well no i you know and that's on purpose it 

306.78 309.57 B: [laughter] 

308.58 311.16 A: used to make just a little polite little bing and 

310.61 313.99 B: [laughter] yeah like mine does yeah now 

313.63 315.39 A: (( just )) 

314.25 317.56 B: do you think if you put your gym on there with that noise you'd go more often 

318.40 319.38 A: [sigh] 

319.83 324.61 A: that's an idea are there are there sounds that are dr- make you think gym 

320.54 321.65 B: [laughter] 

324.25 326.34 B: [laughter] 

328.09 329.69 A: (( you know the the sound of )) 

328.21 328.77 B: [sigh] 

329.88 332.94 A: of wheels you know treadmills and 

332.36 334.19 B: there you go [sigh] 

333.94 336.67 A: weights falling on the floor and that kind of stuff 

336.74 340.35 B: i s- yeah so is it closer to your house or closer to your office 

340.44 341.61 A: the the gym 

341.11 342.27 B: yeah 

341.68 343.27 A: it's closer to the house 

342.89 346.63 B: (( oh okay so you wouldn't have to walk too far in your gym clothes after you've done ought to )) 

346.04 347.25 A: that's that's true 

347.59 352.51 B: see even i i would d- i'd have to drive there 'cause unfortunately florida does not have public transportation 

352.03 352.91 A: yes 

352.74 353.40 B: (( [laughter] )) 

354.05 356.32 B: which sort of defeats the object really doesn't it 

357.01 359.69 B: [laughter] you drive to a gym and then drive to work [sigh] 

359.74 360.86 A: (( mm yeah )) 

361.14 364.19 A: flor- florida's a strangely spread out state isn't it [noise] 

363.58 364.50 B: oh 

364.66 370.91 B: not even the state the towns are terrible it's i mean i came from europe where you know like you had this public transportation everywhere 

370.94 381.35 B: i mean when i was up in washington about four years for a conference for a conference i was like oh my god there's some there is some states countries uh sorry towns that have organisation in public transportation [laughter] 

380.95 381.73 A: yes 

382.59 392.17 B: yeah i must admit that's one part i do miss is the public transportation and i think that'll be part of the problem too if there was l- more more of that people would be more to walk to you know to the bus stops and whatever and 

391.61 392.50 A: yes 

392.58 394.09 B: and not drive as much 

395.07 397.59 B: but uh yeah it's uh 

396.79 402.38 A: we we get spoiled people people sort of grown up with cars and 

401.81 403.61 B: yeah 

402.78 406.50 A: even when o- offered the opportunity to take the subway or a bus 

406.60 411.83 A: it's hard to to change the habit of being able to go at any time you want to 

412.08 413.29 B: yeah 

412.71 413.85 A: (( whatever )) 

415.38 424.22 B: but you find also i mean 'cause it seems to be over here that even when we've tried doing it there seems to be some kind of lobby that doesn't want you to have public transportation which i've never understood but [noise] 

424.52 431.87 A: well i think i think the highway builders profit from building highways and so they don't want you to do it 

429.77 430.86 B: yeah 

431.30 437.41 B: the car makers profit from the cars and [sigh] oil people profit from the oil being used to produce the gas and [sigh] 

436.77 438.79 A: and furthermore the 

439.75 447.68 A: if you do have public transportation it requires some public investment until anybody doesn't want to pay the taxes i 

448.17 450.62 A: mean never mind that they get benefits they 

450.06 452.00 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

451.07 453.13 A: can see the taxes i 

454.44 459.44 A: guess they see that as a greater burden than the benefits just them individually 

459.66 463.16 B: just instant gratification society that we've become 

464.95 469.75 B: i don't get benefit out of it i just don't wanna pay the tax initially [laughter] 

470.01 472.07 B: even though they probably wouldn't see it but [mn] 

472.18 473.05 A: (( yes yes )) 

474.44 476.30 B: (( now do you work for a large corporation )) 

476.00 478.85 A: um i actually work for the defence department 

478.21 479.81 B: oh okay [mn] 

479.70 481.88 A: which is i guess a large corporation 

481.32 482.97 B: [laughter] 

483.45 485.82 B: (( well they could spend enough money to do public transportation )) 

486.47 490.20 A: um the the yeah they could do that 

489.78 496.79 B: [laughter] now how much do you think [mn] do you think that the health and fitness thing has become part of the corporate image though 

497.79 500.20 A: part of the corporate image 

499.60 502.85 B: yeah that if you're not fit fit and healthy you're not 

502.83 506.31 A: well it's it's certainly hm 

509.42 514.16 A: i'd say it looked favorable upon people who are well f- you know reasonably fit and so forth 

513.60 514.88 B: yeah 

515.76 530.57 A: it's sort of like the smoking thing you know it used to be that the majority of the people smoked and now that's a minority thing and people are looked down on for smoking um i guess f- f- you know fitness in the in the sense of um 

530.55 533.26 A: exercise is sort of the same way 

533.39 537.85 A: but it but it's not so easy to tell if a person's exercising or not 

537.44 541.86 B: yeah well unless well then they'd probably just go by the physique kind of stuff 

541.28 542.35 A: yes 

544.61 547.87 B: yeah that's 'cause it was funny i was talking to someone the other day about so you know do you 

548.02 551.69 B: would it stop would it stop someone getting promoted and i'm saying well i'm sure it would 

551.75 557.96 B: i've seen it happen but then again you know you never know if that's the true reason but i'm sure it it wasn't it was a factor 

552.71 553.50 A: yes 

557.88 561.86 A: yes you you saw what uh affect somebody's promotion 

561.86 565.40 B: yeah they if they if they had more if if they're not the slim ideal 

565.23 566.46 A: is that right hm 

565.81 567.27 B: yeah 

568.56 575.70 A: so you're working in a business where because of contact with the public there's an image that's required or 

575.30 577.01 B: no i think it's just the 

577.58 583.69 B: that's part of it but i think also it's be- it's just that if you look if i look at the the surrou- my surrounding colleagues 

583.22 584.17 A: yes 

583.72 589.94 B: and the successful ones would be the ones that stay in the same positions for a while that you can see there's a there's a trend there 

589.43 590.48 A: mhm 

590.62 591.80 B: um 

592.10 594.44 B: which i think is in- is interesting and actually if we 

594.59 599.89 B: [sigh] we were just talking about this at some one of our new diversity initiatives you know it's one of the ones where people don't think
