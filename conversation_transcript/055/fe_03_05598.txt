123.35 137.12 B: yeah yeah i know what it's like like you said we focus so long and hard on it and it's like it's almost it's not forgotten but it's not like you know everybody seemed like they were so united when it happened and now it's like 

137.24 144.08 B: you know it it's not i don't feel like you know like people are as close or back to being their same old you know

157.68 166.45 B: um on on that day itself i was working so you know um i didn't really get to check in you know and watch a lot of stuff until later on 

166.52 167.67 B: um 

168.32 183.19 B: and that's when i you know to me it was more you know intense and you know what i'm saying that's when i would constantly watch it a lot but it's like you know now i i catch up on the news and when the war started just recently i would watch a lot of that but 

183.25 190.02 B: you know with everything you know now that it's not so intense i i will watch it but not like i used to 

190.32 192.05 A: i hear ya um 

192.34 197.06 A: well i've been watching almost every single day and i kinda like how 

197.24 199.69 A: it's been prevented and never happen again 

199.50 209.65 B: yeah oh i i do too you know i think that we're a lot more alert and everything and and now you know i feel better since there is like homeland security and all that and they're doing 

209.45 220.06 B: you know more screening on people wanting to come into the country and why and you know and checking the shoes and and all of this at the airport you know um 

220.70 228.82 B: i i feel safer you know because right after it happened it was like we you know we had to go fly out and it was like i- 

228.69 236.33 B: it wasn't you know now they've got like it seems like a regular you know routine down you know what they've gotta do you know 

234.18 236.16 A: (( exactly they've changed it )) 

236.89 247.56 B: so and and what the and what the you know the more the better x rays and you know all of that type of stuff so i you know you feel more secure on a plane and you just hope it never happens again

253.84 257.55 A: of keeping it constant in other countries and stuff 

256.92 258.91 B: yeah yeah 

258.51 271.94 A: y- you know i'm i was for the iraqi war and i'm or what i'm for i what i've been watching on the news lately is that other countries that have been having enduring these problems now that we've 

263.11 264.14 B: yeah 

271.73 286.27 A: come in there and helped other countries are the citizens are really ac- acting out and trying to get us to do something so at least you know that like it's not all just anti what we're doing and [mn] 

279.40 280.18 B: yeah 

285.58 286.59 B: yeah 

286.60 292.28 B: yeah 'cause it wasn't right all the comments that were made that were negative towards it you know um 

292.78 297.76 B: you know i felt bad for the service people that had to go over there and hear the negatives you know 

297.83 301.47 B: you think you know y- you should be in support of them you know 

301.03 304.78 A: e- e- exactly i mean they're risking their lives not you 

304.60 306.06 B: right exactly 

305.01 313.88 A: 'cause you have the right to go and i mean you would have had the right to protest in if you were in iraq and you protest you'd get killed so 

313.56 315.11 B: right exactly 

314.44 318.98 A: protesting us giving the right for a different country to do what you doing

372.46 379.36 B: it's those people over there they don't need to see you know they're over there like you said risking their lives and everything and they don't need to see all this 

379.32 388.21 B: negative publicity at home i mean you know to me that that would make 'em feel like crap like why are we fighting you know we don't even have them backing us you know 

388.30 389.53 B: (( so )) 

389.47 395.23 A: and then you have the movie stars and all that what's even worse than

411.88 414.29 B: oh that's cool that's cool 

413.37 419.83 A: no i and i just think that anybody who's going to get behind them and 

419.33 421.62 B: yeah yeah 

420.89 421.85 A: do this

423.97 424.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

425.77 431.67 A: say words back but how how else are you gonna get other countries like that to become free 

431.60 433.62 B: right exactly 

432.21 433.00 A: or 

433.04 443.21 A: or to become you know to get the same rights that we have y- you're you're all for protesting when that's just what the other countries can't do
