0.48 1.76 A: hello 

1.85 2.99 B: hello 

2.68 5.89 A: hi my name's david i live in berkeley california 

6.15 11.02 B: uh my name is paul i live in southern california i've been to berkeley many times 

10.85 14.63 A: oh great well let's see uh censorship 

12.13 12.96 B: (( [mn] )) 

14.71 23.12 B: censorship and something about schools either being required to allow or prohibit certain books i didn't quite catch the way they said it did you 

22.87 27.75 A: should should public schools be allowed to prohibit students 

27.76 30.54 A: from reading certain books 

30.43 31.72 B: is that the way they said it 

31.40 34.46 A: that's not exactly but that's that's what i got 

35.50 42.89 B: well i imagine the prohibiting would be the way they would normally uh phrase a question like that to make it uh more lively and controversial perhaps 

42.47 43.46 A: yeah 

44.66 45.92 B: well uh 

46.34 47.69 A: have you encountered it 

46.34 47.54 B: my opinion 

47.78 50.19 A: i'm i'm sorry have have you encountered this 

47.85 48.71 B: pardon 

50.22 55.91 B: i have not except for just watching and listening to news in general i have not personally encountered it at all 

55.54 56.72 A: mhm 

56.36 60.01 B: fortunately and uh although i believe it does occur 

60.31 68.01 B: and probably uh more than we would would know at this point but my opinions are that it shouldn't occur uh very often at all 

63.77 64.65 A: yeah 

67.99 79.74 B: and probably not nearly as much as it most likely probably does based on what i know about school boards and how they tend to uh assert themselves in these kinds of decisions and often times i think uh actually in 

79.92 82.94 B: in objection to uh teachers probably 

82.65 83.52 A: (( mhm )) 

83.73 85.87 B: what experiences have you had 

85.28 93.74 A: none i i i don't have children although i do plan to so i know that these issues are gonna have to gonna have to come up for me 

93.86 99.31 A: um how i feel about a a school making making that kind of a decision 

99.44 105.24 A: um i'm trying what i'm trying to do is to put myself in that situation what 

105.47 114.82 A: um should would i have done and i i i guess i need to ask it out loud do i think that uh a school should prohibit my child from reading 

115.03 124.93 A: something um well i think they do already because they they um limit what they're going to include in their collection 

125.50 126.06 B: (( [cough] )) 

126.30 132.49 B: well they they prohibit in the sense i think they're right uh although i i i'm not sure whether i would consider 

132.64 147.20 B: strictly speaking prohibiting books x y and z but nonetheless by by creating a a pos- positive uh book reading lists and requirements for what must be read i guess indirectly they are uh limiting or 

147.21 153.59 B: significantly limiting and it's not sp- specifically put as a as a required item to be read 

153.55 160.54 A: oh okay yeah i i i wasn't thinking i was thinking more in terms of libraries i hadn't thought about thought in your terms which is 

160.80 163.71 A: assignments i think it what you're saying right 

163.49 175.77 B: [cough] yeah i'm thinking of required reading uh which i again they didn't say in the uh in the set up what what levels of academics we're talking about here but certainly as you get further and further along the curve of 

175.79 182.78 B: of the educational um track you get more and more specifically required uh kinds of things put in front of you 

182.85 189.68 B: obviously libraries themselves um are a different different issue i think from the way the question was posed although 

189.87 195.93 B: um restricting things from being in a library is certainly a very lively conversation topic as well 

195.47 201.15 A: yeah i i was thinking specifically of of school libraries and what they will and will not 

201.19 214.21 A: include because i think that's that's the one place where it would happen more than in the public library a general public library so that was that was my first thought so well let's let's stick with the way you uh 

214.16 218.47 A: with the way you were approaching this which was um required reading 

218.59 223.81 A: um yeah that is i mean that is a a form of censorship 

223.89 224.97 A: um 

225.94 226.95 A: (( how )) 

226.19 234.97 B: in as much as it imposes the the views of uh whatever teacher is uh creating the required list uh they'd be they're be giving a lot a 

231.52 232.48 A: right 

235.09 241.66 B: very high degree of latitude and discretion in in that decision uh which of course you expect their training would prepare them for 

241.74 251.98 B: but i i believe we've seen instances where teachers and classes have been told you may not use a certain book because of the imposition of uh an overriding authority by a school board which is 

252.13 259.68 B: usually politics i suppose but in often times uh have decided to usurp that authority or that discretion in some some instances 

259.41 267.05 A: right okay so i think that's more what they're pushing us towards which is those the people in authority who have decided 

267.30 273.19 A: decided what what can and cannot appear in in a ch- child curriculum 

273.11 282.70 B: i think so i think so because when you get into the college level you pretty much have uh unless they get fired which isn't very often they pretty much have total control in in the professor 

282.79 293.84 B: but on the uh secondary level you certainly have a high degree of profile of of school boards that uh obviously have a political base because that's how people become members of those 

293.89 306.33 B: and uh therefore you've gotta either a a perceived or a desired responsiveness in the school board to uh perhaps oversee or manage or micro manage some might say [laughter] uh the curriculum process 

303.59 304.59 A: right 

306.13 307.57 A: right 

307.24 315.44 B: and uh i guess i my feeling would be that i don't like seeing that uh for a couple of reasons one is political perhaps more than 

315.48 319.10 B: it ought to be and secondly it seems like it would have people who were 

318.98 331.64 B: maybe not as well uh prepared educationally for the education process uh i guess school boards are made up of all kinds of people but certainly the teacher in a classroom is is presumably always been certified as a qualified educator 

331.56 332.52 A: right 

331.80 338.53 B: and i'd be happy to trust their judgments uh in general i think as as the primary source for those decisions 

338.53 344.82 A: yeah i think i i think i agree with you i i would be more trusting of someone who has been trained 

344.83 347.51 A: uh to deal with uh 

348.13 355.54 A: i what i imagine would be a a diver- diverse points of view and being able to to filter them appropriately for 

355.48 364.98 A: for children to i mean what what they need to read to learn about about different kinds of things and i think it it points up to me um 

365.05 372.65 A: kind of what my responsibilities are are going to be as when i have children in that i need to participate in um 

372.74 381.08 A: not only what i mean learning what they're doing like hi what what did you learn in class today or what are you reading in class uh this this week 

381.38 384.40 A: but not only that but being involved with 

384.64 389.05 A: wherever it is that they make those kinds of decisions i mean 

389.38 391.03 A: (( um does a )) 

391.15 394.19 A: the school board have public meetings 

394.26 401.50 A: um if they i mean and where they do make these decisions um if those sorts of decisions are published 

402.03 413.53 B: well i think that that whole field um and i've i'm obviously a little older than you but i've been through this with children through school uh certainly did not pay the kind of attention that i i think i probably could and should have 

402.33 402.91 A: (( mhm )) 

413.45 420.51 B: but the uh parent you know to the extent we want to trust the teacher then we have to i think assume a certain responsibility as parents to uh 

420.49 426.71 B: at least oversee and and and pay attention to what the students are being asked to or the children are being asked to read 

426.59 441.55 B: and if there's something that requires some kind of speaking out i guess that's that's the time to do it but also the ability to to uh complement and supplement uh whatever those readings might be with with additional things that as parents you might think children should be exposed to that you know they are not 

441.45 444.41 B: um by virtue of what the school is showing them 

443.54 444.93 A: right so 

444.69 449.01 B: there's a chance to augment and be an even better parent i would think 

448.43 455.38 A: right so show them i mean what like my experience would would be about um at least 

455.44 466.67 A: if not just tell them not not just telling them my experience about what you know a a different opinion about this um about whatever it is they they've read about but also um 

467.15 468.88 A: refer them or at least 

468.97 482.81 A: i mean i think it would make me more connected with my child if i were to say well you know i don't completely agree with what they teach in a book that that teaches this so why don't we go together to a library 

482.84 485.53 A: and find a book that'll that'll um 

485.73 487.51 A: that'll tell us something different 

487.63 501.81 B: i've become aware recently in some things that that lead me to think that parents' responsibility should even be greater now than perhaps a few years um ago in this area because of what i think is occurring you never know what you can believe and what you can't and what's 

495.53 496.50 A: mhm 

501.82 503.48 B: told to us over television 

503.13 504.02 A: mhm 

503.32 512.76 B: but my understanding is that there are uh relatively few numbers of companies that publish the books or at least the textbooks that b- bought and used in schools and that 

512.55 524.84 B: in order for those to be purchased they have to approved by um the states and school boards and that uh there's a substantial amount of controversy in the book industry right now at least from what i've what i've seen and read 

517.68 518.77 A: mhm 

524.79 538.02 B: that uh is is a sort of co-opting the political correctness process to a point of perhaps even in some cases rewriting history as to what ends up in the book and the publishers are sort of at the mercy of the buyers 

532.49 533.44 A: mhm 

538.05 547.07 B: and if you're gonna sell sell books to california schools uh you don't wanna be on the on the list that's not allowed to be purchased so if to the extent that there are 

544.49 545.47 A: right 

546.96 553.61 B: you know um and apparently there are very strict kinds of and i don't know if this happens at a state level or local level or both 

553.51 566.88 B: but there really are some very str- um specific guidelines put out to publishers saying you have to call this that and you can't call this that and some of this is highly um political correctness driven to the extreme some of it may even be uh 

566.66 573.64 B: sort of rewriting how the how the the way of history actually comes out compared to where you and i may have learned it or understood it 

573.46 574.35 A: mhm 

573.73 585.22 B: and the fact that there's this power in place and i i think it's really true um we probably have an issue that's emerging that hasn't been been really very true prior to the political correctness era 

585.22 589.74 B: that we should be as parents paying some attention to that maybe we didn't need to before 

590.38 591.20 A: yeah 

590.44 593.91 B: so there's something to think about it for you as you have children coming in the future 

593.59 596.28 A: yeah what what it it 

596.37 599.89 A: sounds kind of encouraging to me because in a way
