1.34 3.06 A: (( hi how're you doing i'm mike )) 

3.16 4.84 B: hi i'm patrick 

4.29 5.61 A: hey patrick what's up 

5.44 6.60 B: not much 

7.04 12.41 A: hey so you're not a a receptionist with this company you're actually like me you signed up for this 

11.83 13.60 B: yeah yeah exactly 

13.01 20.66 A: oh i got it now okay so both of us talk about it i got it i thought someone would like ask us what to say or something like that [laughter] 

13.93 15.31 B: [laughter] 

16.42 18.19 B: (( [laughter] )) 

19.82 24.65 B: right right yeah um and and and and the topics 

21.50 22.45 A: okay 

24.70 26.55 B: i i didn't catch it 

25.91 32.75 A: i i think it said that should uh schools be able to restrict students from reading certain books inside the school 

32.39 33.38 B: (( oh okay )) 

32.87 35.39 A: for censorship censorship reasons 

36.04 36.60 B: (( [mn] )) 

36.91 43.09 A: [laughter] yeah it's a rough one this is my first one and i was like wow they hit me with a hard one 

36.91 37.74 B: that's 

37.93 39.28 B: that's a toughie 

41.26 42.19 B: [laughter] 

42.54 46.15 B: yeah me too man [laughter] 

43.62 49.41 A: [laughter] um i personally would think that yes 

49.51 63.01 A: and and i shouldn't say that i'm i'm in college right now anyway um the only reason i say yes they should restrict it is because i'm i'm not sure what kind of boundaries they could cross since they're not exactly the parents and maybe the parents don't want them to be exposed to certain things 

52.46 53.28 B: okay 

62.91 64.16 B: right right 

63.56 72.46 A: but maybe they should just uh send out a letter maybe [laughter] to the parents and asking them permission to go over a certain book but you know that would only cause more problems but 

68.62 69.31 B: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

72.80 81.10 A: that's my input i think maybe yes just because of the parents' problem but i do not have children so it's hard for me to say [laughter] how about you [laughter] [noise] 

77.71 91.74 B: [laughter] right and it and the degree of of censorship where [sigh] see i didn't catch the whole thing i i wasn't sure if they said they said something about requiring students to read certain books 

91.15 96.33 A: right yeah they did so i think it's it maybe out of class too 

96.23 97.51 B: yeah 

96.79 98.14 A: maybe [noise] 

97.67 106.93 B: well i you know there's the the whole issue of the huck finn uh book and tom sawyer which is an american classic on one hand 

101.75 103.86 A: yeah right that was a big one of 

106.32 107.93 A: course it is 

107.58 113.13 B: and then on the other hand you know th- there's some pretty racy uh stuff going on 

108.80 109.65 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

112.69 114.35 A: i agree i agree 

113.28 115.70 B: and so [sigh] 

116.04 120.53 B: you know you don't know i i think if the parents don't agree 

120.77 123.33 B: with the book there should be alternatives 

122.72 124.33 A: yeah i'm with you on that one 

124.21 125.20 B: (( you know )) 

125.34 127.35 B: um [laughter] 

126.94 135.25 A: so maybe if there's like a a moral the teacher's trying to pass off maybe they can have another book in mind just in case the parents don't agree for the first one 

134.67 136.61 B: exactly yeah 

135.85 147.74 A: just to pass off the same moral but in different ways like to not go through like the catcher in the rye with all the swear words or anything like that maybe there's another way you can go through that [laughter] but it's hard because they're going to miss the classics like you said [noise] 

143.80 145.23 B: right [laughter] 

147.30 155.59 B: right yeah and and that that's a toughie i mean we [laughter] i i don't know uh your history a- and uh 

155.94 159.85 B: grade school but we were forced to read [laughter] that stuff [laughter] 

158.86 171.46 A: yeah we were forced to read catcher in the rye and i think there was one other one that was just loaded with swear words and racial words and [laughter] everything and i just took it as part of the book and you know i just went on but you never know how some parents would feel so [laughter] 

165.82 166.81 B: yeah 

171.05 177.23 B: and i think uh the kids are smart enough especially nowadays to to be able to distinguish between 

177.24 181.64 B: you know a a role model in a in a novel and a 

182.63 184.04 B: (( [sigh] i don't know )) 

183.74 193.08 A: i i agree i agree what they're saying 'cause in the movie they you know in movies too they play the part and then they know it's not something they should follow that's just a part they're watching same thing with a book i think 

192.98 199.73 A: they can read it and understand it that it's not so- something they're supposed to do but it's part of the book so part of the plot [laughter] 

196.96 197.92 B: right 

199.09 202.24 B: in the end say the issue with i don't know the 

201.88 216.45 A: but it's tough then you put yourself in a teacher position and you say okay i know this book is good i know they should read this and they should be able to distinguish this and then bam you assign it and then a parent comes flying after you and says my student my son has never seen that word before or something like that [laughter] and then what do you do 

213.95 215.33 B: [laughter] 

216.36 217.11 B: (( [cough] )) 

216.36 218.91 A: [laughter] [laughter] that's tough 

218.15 223.33 B: right i i i don't know i i would get back to the parent i- i think the whole issue 

223.36 224.50 B: uh is 

224.54 227.16 B: should stay in the parents' hands 

226.86 228.28 A: yeah i agree 

227.70 228.88 B: and uh 

230.14 233.60 B: [mn] i don't know but there there's some instances when 

234.04 234.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

234.64 238.72 B: no you can't really force anyone to do anything [laughter] 

237.02 239.52 A: yes you can it's uh that's the only problem with it 

239.18 240.46 B: [laughter] 

239.77 253.35 A: now the kid are in school the parents want 'em there and then you can't just play i guess parent force them to read the p- certain book or force them to do this or that even though they do in school i mean there are some things they force kids to do even though it has nothing to do with reading book but 

253.86 256.72 A: you kinda can't cross the line there because it could be 

254.01 254.92 B: right 

256.90 269.42 A: telling them something that the parents has always told them something opposite of that or we try to teach 'em different i don't know but at the same time they're always gonna miss some very important books so [laughter] it's tough it's tough for a teacher i'm sure 

266.70 267.61 B: right 

269.53 272.08 B: well it depends on their the curriculum too 

269.61 270.37 A: wonder 

272.12 283.43 A: yeah 'cause they're in an in an advanced english course maybe in ninth grade or something like that you would kind of expect them to read books like that and i don't think a parent would object to that but 

272.27 272.83 B: (( [mn] )) 

282.82 284.60 B: sure yeah 

284.17 286.59 A: basic reading i i don't think [laughter] 

284.97 285.86 B: like 

285.93 287.88 B: like a college prep course 

287.51 293.35 A: right exactly so if they're they're ready to read stuff like that and ready to dismiss it if they need to [laughter] 

292.66 294.65 B: [laughter] right right 

294.33 296.45 A: [noise] that's a rough one though [laughter] 

295.90 297.87 B: i know [laughter] for 

296.68 309.20 A: i mean i was on the message board about this thing and some people were talking about like pets how much time they spend with their dogs and stuff like that i'm like i want that one [laughter] and this is my first one and i'm like holy crap [laughter] 

303.69 305.70 B: [laughter] 

307.31 309.95 B: (( [laughter] )) 

309.06 312.06 A: this is stuff that people debate over for like weeks you know 

311.48 313.16 B: [laughter] i know 

312.60 316.42 A: i'm not a big debater at all i don't know anything about this stuff [laughter] 

315.27 316.51 B: [laughter] 

316.57 321.65 B: no i i mean and when it when it said censorship i i'm an artist 

321.07 322.37 A: yeah 

321.80 323.06 B: and so i've 

323.31 327.23 B: i've got pretty strong feelings about censorship in in general 

326.60 328.42 A: right of course you do [laughter] 

327.53 331.48 B: but then [laughter] yeah but then it comes back down to uh 

331.56 335.34 B: grade school reading [laughter] 

333.10 333.97 A: yes 

334.50 344.82 A: and i'm just like okay censorship is one thing but grade school reading is something else [laughter] now we're working with you know seven year olds eight year olds nine years olds reading important books but [laughter] it 

337.35 339.44 B: (( and i [laughter] )) 

342.70 349.15 B: [laughter] wh- wasn't it they tau- it was elementary school [laughter] [laughter] 

346.32 353.49 A: was elementary yep you're right so that's all the way up until maybe twelve years old little older think so 

351.89 353.13 B: yeah 

353.68 355.44 B: eleven yeah 

354.77 361.65 A: yeah that's when the parents are really trying to instill values so it's a little rough cross that line [laughter] 

359.17 360.62 B: i don't [sigh] 

360.92 365.86 B: yeah i don't i don't i ha- i really haven't heard much about 

365.95 368.39 B: censorship at that level 

367.81 369.08 A: right 

368.99 370.61 B: [mn] you know 

369.58 372.90 A: i i agree i haven't heard that i've heard it in high schools before 

371.99 376.14 B: i mean what a they could possibly 

376.61 382.37 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] censorship or forcing kids to read i'm uh they could be talking about the harry potter books 

382.37 384.03 A: uh that's a good point [noise] 

383.27 385.67 B: [noise] or or thinking about this 

385.85 387.18 B: the whole uh 

387.89 391.37 B: i don't know that phenomenon going on right now and 

390.45 394.17 A: what grade did they force you to read huck finn in do you remember 

393.03 395.28 B: [mn] i don't know fourth fifth 

394.84 399.29 A: so that was elementary school yeah i can't remember when i read it so 

396.01 397.23 B: yeah 

398.88 401.28 B: or it was tom sawyer was the first one 

400.79 402.47 A: (( oh tom sawyer yeah [noise] )) 

401.93 406.31 B: and then huck finn was later 'cause it was a bigger book [laughter] 

404.58 407.96 A: yeah and they made you read them both in elementary school 

407.97 411.33 B: yeah i think well i think huck finn was sixth grade 

411.17 416.02 A: yeah that still counts oh yeah that goes into middle school but still it's close enough [laughter] 

413.76 414.78 B: yeah 

415.31 416.72 B: yeah right 

416.12 427.75 A: they are doing in elementary school there are some books out there that parents could be iffy about but yeah i agree with the harry potter thing i mean now you're working with magic and all that and maybe some parents don't want that i don't know 

421.28 421.87 B: [mn] 

427.27 432.00 B: yeah and possibly some teachers have it in their you know in their reading list 

431.33 443.34 A: i wouldn't be surprised it's supposed to be you know i i read one of 'em it's s'posed to be a literary masterpiece like just the way it's written so it might be good for a child to read that but maybe not a parent parent might not agree with that [laughter] 

442.93 448.31 B: yeah haven't i ha- haven't had the opportunity i think they're harmless books uh 

447.11 448.50 A: yeah i agree 

448.63 451.94 B: but you're wondering what kind of educational value if 

448.71 449.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

452.19 452.75 B: (( [mn] )) 

453.06 455.65 B: any reading is good reading [laughter] i think 

454.40 461.72 A: i was just going to say that as a matter of fact i mean you you can read anything it's not necessary you don't have to take an educational thing out of it you just get the practice 

460.34 461.24 B: [laughter] 

461.32 462.60 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

461.88 465.21 A: like you need when you're eight years old and nine years old 

463.31 464.48 B: especially if 

464.59 467.24 B: correct correct especially at that level 

466.62 468.63 A: yeah that's all you need is just 

468.69 475.20 A: learn words learn your words practise reading all that good stuff you don't always have to take some big giant plot out of it [laughter] 

474.51 476.11 B: yeah 

475.34 478.79 A: [noise] i think harry potter's a good one to do that with [laughter] 

478.16 486.96 B: i'm i'm all for like like the little the individual sort of the system of where where a kid gets to do a book report on his own 

486.71 487.98 A: right right 

487.15 492.93 B: little take i mean it's hard to analyze a book that [sigh] that way 

488.77 490.02 A: yeah because once you 

492.92 503.50 B: i mean uh hard for a teacher to go through and you know teach kids that level how to analyze and read a book properly but 

502.70 505.32 A: very hard you have to learn on your own i think 

504.50 505.95 B: yeah 

505.81 517.22 A: that's the best way to do it book reports they teach you to go through and figure out the plots and all the more and all that good stuff i remember doing a few of those [laughter] [laughter] i wish i would have done more now that i think about it but 

513.03 514.29 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

517.40 518.98 A: good to learn from 

518.45 521.81 B: [laughter] yes not grad school yeah 

521.37 529.96 A: oh yeah see my grad school is all engineering so unfortunately i don't get any exposure to think literary anything it's unfortunate yeah they don't 

528.15 529.34 B: really [mn] 

530.10 543.62 A: they don't focus [mn] on any arts on any anything like that they just it's straight math and science and it's unfortunate because i'm losing all my skills now uh as far as reading and being able to analyze books and chapters and that type of stuff so 

542.78 544.45 B: yeah yeah 

544.22 552.81 A: it's terrible for an engineer there's always stereotypes going on that you know once we graduate grad school we can't l- read we can't write and [laughter] it's horrible [laughter] 

552.18 553.73 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

552.98 556.03 A: (( [laughter] i wish we were exposed more to reading [laughter] )) 

554.99 562.42 B: [laughter] well yeah and and who knows if you have to read a paper in the future at some convention or something 

561.81 570.17 A: yes yeah you need to keep practicing so that's why it's important to start when you're young [laughter] not to have people tell you no you can't read this you can't read that [laughter] 

564.01 565.37 B: speech writing 

569.53 571.01 B: [laughter] right 

570.42 571.98 A: so but 

571.42 572.69 B: [laughter] 

571.93 583.98 A: i guess in the long run they probably will have to ask like you said have ask permission and have a back up something just in case a parent says no i don't want him reading this so maybe that one student could read the other book 

583.89 593.30 A: and do his own book report just in case the parent doesn't want them to read the first book so that way maybe you know ninety percent of the class still reads what the pr- teacher wants them to read hm 

587.49 588.67 B: yeah 

592.92 599.89 B: and they [mn] usually at at the beginning of h- h- of the s- semester or
