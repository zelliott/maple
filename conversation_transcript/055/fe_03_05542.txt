189.58 192.58 B: harder or easier um to 

192.61 197.56 B: motivate yourself to workout and go to the gym now that you've like entered the workforce and or is it easier like you know 

196.80 210.97 A: it's a lot easier [laughter] for me right now just because i partied a lot in college [laughter] i don't know like i i didn't i did all right in college and you know like [lipsmack] i studied when i needed to and i did work and everything but 

201.14 203.23 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

211.02 225.73 A: i don't know for me it was kind of you know a time to relax and i wasn't as motivated and all my friends were kind of into partying so i i did i did it somewhat but not nearly as much as i'm trying to now 

215.45 217.12 B: right 

220.64 221.59 B: (( yeah )) 

225.65 226.68 B: yeah

232.60 234.59 B: where did you uh do your under grad 

234.72 236.67 A: university of pittsburgh 

236.35 237.45 B: (( [lipsmack] okay )) 

237.26 249.94 A: yep and i stayed financed there so i was kind of doing the business thing although i don't think i want to you know stay in business but it's something to er it's something for now you know 

238.12 239.09 B: (( that's cool )) 

249.86 252.97 B: yeah i have i have a lot of friends there in finance 

253.24 261.63 A: so do you what do you want to do after you graduate and do you think that will impact your [noise] you know working out and fitness stuff 

253.27 254.33 B: and uh 

258.83 259.39 B: (( [mn] )) 

262.48 264.24 A: [laughter] 

263.68 270.25 B: uh i you know i i kind of feel the same way you do i think the same thing it's just gonna improve because my 

270.34 275.75 B: uh i mean i don't have much structure to my life i mean i go to cl- i'm in class maybe like twelve hours a week 

275.02 275.98 A: uh-huh 

275.64 279.64 B: and you know that just uh promotes a lot of sleeping and uh 

278.82 280.53 A: [laughter] 

279.44 290.72 B: and and being lazy and um you know staying up late at night and i think it'd be easier just to like you know if i'm up every day at eight o'clock you know i'm at work at nine i'm off at five you know 

287.78 289.02 A: yeah 

290.33 291.36 A: yeah 

290.48 304.86 B: and have the whole evening to you know get dinner workout go to bed and then it's like the next day it starts all over again and it's more straightforward and i think it's easier uh uh and e- i mean even though you have less time less free time i think 

296.57 297.53 A: yeah 

298.90 301.74 A: yeah it's kind of depressing [laughter] 

304.47 309.09 A: [cough] you get into a structure that's what i meant yeah that's what i'm saying 

304.94 306.35 B: even like you 

307.39 313.64 B: yeah yeah yeah and i've i've always wanted to like workout a little bit 'cause i've always been like pretty skinny 

313.37 314.55 A: yep 

314.44 315.90 B: and uh you know 

315.99 318.94 B: i mean i've always been like in shape and like healthy but

434.01 436.70 B: my under grad i did journalism which is 

437.03 445.57 B: it's okay but you know i don't want to go to graduate school for the same thing but ultimately i think i want to like uh get a phd if i can

445.34 446.48 A: that's awesome 

446.62 451.19 B: it's i mean it's a really bad time to enter the workforce so i don't really see any

481.41 484.66 B: yeah i wonder like how rigid you have to stick to the topic 

484.97 493.44 A: i don't think like i think because it's about communication they're looking at i don't know maybe just how people 

485.11 486.05 B: i mean 

493.81 494.68 B: right 

494.08 496.75 A: talk and stick to the subject they're doing

496.84 499.53 A: yeah i mean it's kind of a weird 

499.57 507.90 A: it's a weird thing to put somebody into you know like just talking on the phone with a complete stranger about a completely you know 

508.24 509.52 B: right 

508.87 511.65 A: made up topic [laughter] [laughter]

514.80 524.29 B: you know i've never been in- involved in a study of any kind i always see those things where people are getting paid like thousands of dollars to be in focus groups and like i always thought that would be cool 

523.76 537.43 A: [laughter] my friends in college did stuff like giving like plasma or something or you know something like hardcore where they steal your body for the weekend then afterwards like you just [laughter] want to die because like

591.32 591.95 B: (( mm )) 

592.18 599.22 B: yeah they're probably like a more like a older community from what i've heard [noise] but i heard it's very affluent
