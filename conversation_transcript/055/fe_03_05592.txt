75.35 76.75 A: [noise] okay 

76.39 80.92 B: so it's um you know it's either new york l._a. or

90.93 92.36 B: that's not too far 

92.62 100.14 A: so i i guess i would would miss the uh initial contact unless it was biological yeah so 

97.78 106.88 B: yeah that's true or nuclear or something like that um yeah i mean i don't think i've overall i haven't really changed any 

100.58 102.73 A: yeah 

106.95 109.70 B: of my daily day to day activities 

108.79 111.49 A: mhm 

109.72 117.94 B: in regards to september eleventh but overall i would have to agree with you my awareness level whereas uh before i guess i was in a um 

118.19 119.38 B: nice 

119.78 121.16 A: comfort zone 

119.88 127.60 B: uh bubble of not knowing anything and and not being aware and not even you know if it doesn't adversely affect me 

122.63 124.47 A: yeah 

127.53 135.69 B: um you know type of situation type of attitude and i think as americans we all have taken that for granted for many many years 

133.31 137.20 A: mhm yeah we're in a comfort zone 

136.81 140.88 B: oh without a doubt and i think we're actually falling back into a comfort zone 

140.41 145.28 A: i think so too and when you think okay now just the other day i was hearing where uh 

141.50 143.37 B: (( um )) 

145.45 149.98 A: uh saddam actually sent in another uh recorded message 

150.01 153.40 A: and so the people there in iraq are are afraid again 

153.68 156.58 A: that he and his people are going to be coming back in some way 

156.57 157.65 B: yeah 

157.08 162.64 A: and i don't think that they got him and and he's not scared [laughter] 

162.43 166.96 B: yeah i don't think they got him either i agree with you i don't know if those 

166.97 172.89 B: i don't know i i'm on the fence um i don't think they have concrete evidence obviously that 

172.68 185.01 B: whether they got him or not whether he escaped or not i think there's a possiblity he could have been killed but i think the it's leaning for me my opinion is more towards that he got away um 'cause i do believe 

182.29 184.50 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

184.91 196.58 B: all this propaganda that's going on with releasing tapes and all that someone's behind it whether it be saddam or be one of his sons or one of his henchmen there is something that is you know 

190.08 191.83 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

194.63 202.72 A: exactly and i watch a program a few a few weeks ago i didn't realize how serious it was 

197.62 199.16 B: perpetuating it 

202.83 214.04 A: you know i with with the distance between us and not really being that that aware of international uh events i didn't realize that his family was so ruthless 

209.25 210.33 B: mhm 

213.77 219.39 B: they were horrible vicious dictators for years and years and years 

219.01 227.74 A: you know when they were talking about pits that they threw bodies in and started burying them while they were still alive and you know that that kind of stuff reminded me of hitler 

223.51 225.13 B: hundreds yeah 

227.24 235.85 B: exact- well that's it you know it it's fascist you know uh not communists because you know he he was um 

230.52 233.02 A: (( and )) 

236.02 239.53 B: you know he was a monarchy you know that he 

237.69 238.98 A: yes 

239.68 242.29 B: basically deemed himself 

241.62 243.84 A: [noise] yes exactly 

242.85 251.72 B: you know it wasn't any no nothing because of his family heritage or anything along those lines it was something that he took over and i am king [laughter] 

251.31 252.94 A: (( yeah )) 

251.94 260.11 B: you know so he he was from the get go he was a vicious dictator and just through the years he got this narcissistic attitude of 

260.16 271.28 B: you know saddam saddam everything saddam i mean he had how many hundreds and millions of dollars stocked stocked up somewhere and his people are going starving [mn] 

266.64 276.51 A: [noise] yeah yes well they they showed where uh where he sent a proclamation to the bank telling the bank to send all of its money to his house 

276.50 284.14 A: and they had three eighteen wheel trucks that went and loaded up money and brought it back to the to the palace 

281.56 282.53 B: just so he 

284.17 286.19 B: oh right be- prior to the war 

285.82 288.33 A: uh i think it was way before then 

288.35 291.50 B: really i didn't even hear that part 

289.01 290.58 A: yeah and uh 

290.88 302.60 A: yeah there was a lady that was running the bank and she got the proclamation and she just had to open the doors and these royal guard come in and just take out you know palette loads of cash 

293.31 294.35 B: mhm 

302.28 303.78 B: that's crazy 

303.21 305.22 A: yeah 

303.93 309.93 B: that's cra- i mean not that these poor people had any money were making any money to begin with 

309.75 311.21 A: exactly 

309.96 318.79 B: let alone the little pithings of savings that they maybe had i mean they it's like the the classic difference is rich and poor

319.83 323.39 B: no nothing nah no no inbetween 

323.59 328.03 B: but just think of the poor people that tried to save some money all their money [mn] 

326.67 330.53 A: well i'm just wondering what's going to happen to the people that were actually uh 

330.54 344.68 A: you know on the newscasts and everything that were uh you know looting and rampaging and going in the royal uh facilities and taking out stuff will they be singled out yeah 

338.74 341.71 B: yeah like the uh uh art art museums 

341.82 343.32 B: like the museums 

343.31 351.75 B: they actually um i saw that they actually recovered they seem to think about ninety percent of uh what was looted 

351.13 353.18 A: really 

351.72 362.85 B: through yeah through intelligent sources through um people turning other people in basically not for any other incentive but just to the pride of the iraqi people 

357.41 358.71 A: [noise] 

362.01 364.56 A: mhm 

363.18 376.50 B: which is you know you know you kinda think and i can't i really can't blame the iraqi people for you know now even the violence that's going on towards our soldiers every day you hear two soldiers killed three soldiers killed
