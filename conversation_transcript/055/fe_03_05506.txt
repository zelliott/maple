0.00 2.02 A: hi my name's tucker 

2.31 4.01 B: oh hi my name's robert 

3.68 5.20 A: (( hi robert how are you )) 

4.94 6.28 B: i'm good 

5.68 10.58 A: yeah um so the topic is uh censorship 

10.01 11.93 B: yeah 

10.79 16.17 A: uh what about school books and public school um hm 

14.05 15.20 B: yeah 

16.29 20.02 A: (( uh i'm trying to think uh )) 

20.16 32.97 A: you know to some degree i believe that they have uh uh obligation not to you know like have like porno books and stuff like that but pretty much um there's not a whole lot you can do 

27.98 29.41 B: yeah i i agree 

32.66 33.54 B: yeah 

32.88 34.26 A: um 

34.15 49.07 A: you can you can't really stop somebody from from you know looking at something or reading something and you know if if you make a let's say you make a banned list of what not to look at and stuff like that that's gonna make everybody want to look at that's what i would want to look at 

47.21 49.23 B: exactly exactly 

48.97 51.96 A: so in other words if you tell me like oh this book like 

52.19 60.32 A: you know i don't want this book in school or whatever you know um i know me personally that would make me want to go out and like read it you know 

59.76 62.56 B: yeah the more taboo yeah the more taboo it is 

60.88 65.31 A: right the more the more they try the more uh people are gonna 

65.20 67.92 B: mhm hello 

67.75 68.77 A: hello 

68.36 69.17 B: (( hello )) 

68.80 69.97 A: yeah 

69.34 71.56 B: (( all right yeah )) 

70.50 72.46 A: yeah hold on one second all right 

71.83 72.70 B: sure 

75.47 78.44 A: okay never mind yeah 

77.05 84.24 B: mhm yeah i definitely agree with with you on that because uh you can't really shield children from uh 

84.96 95.60 B: everything uh to some extent like what you said uh adult material you you definitely have to pre- prevent children from seeing but i mean anything else should only help 

85.81 86.73 A: right 

91.19 92.40 A: (( right )) 

95.82 105.95 B: and uh uh give give the children you know a better you know grasp of what the outside world is actually like it can only help yeah definitely 

102.98 110.40 A: exactly yeah yeah um yeah so uh you've done this before this uh survey thing 

110.00 112.68 B: uh no this is the first time i've done this 

111.63 118.63 A: actually i did it last month and i got my check last week so just to let you know it is a real deal so 

115.70 116.63 B: oh 

117.85 119.74 B: oh okay yeah this is the first 

118.60 127.88 A: i took the calls and stuff like that like you know um and it worked out i got a check i kinda forgot about it and i get the check i'm like what i'm like oh yeah right 

125.48 126.40 B: oh 

127.12 129.85 B: [laughter] this is the first one i've tried so yeah 

128.86 136.03 A: so uh it's it is a good deal like what the fuck a couple of minutes i think it's about ten bucks a call or something like that so that's uh 

133.85 138.72 B: yeah it's definitely worth it yeah yeah definitely 

136.28 141.04 A: that's good money yeah you know regardless of how much money you make or whatever yeah so um 

138.89 141.36 B: [laughter] yeah 

141.01 150.95 A: yeah the censorship thing you know this country's a little a little screwed up um you know they limit a lot of things but yet they're crazy on the same notion like uh 

147.46 148.67 B: definitely 

150.86 156.49 A: uh like in spain and france and places like that there's t._v. commercials the way you see like uh naked women 

156.02 167.72 B: yeah i know over here they censor everything like uh they always blame everything on video games and on on what the movies show or what television programs show but i mean you can't protect children from everything yeah 

163.21 164.90 A: right yeah yeah 

166.28 175.14 A: right yeah and i mean you can go to the video store and just rent the crap anyway so i mean you know the fact they're they're stopping it on t._v. it's not really helping the situation 

169.62 172.06 B: yeah it doesn't really prevent you 

174.62 178.56 B: yeah they they're yeah exactly 

175.21 187.03 A: you know you just go to freaking blockbuster and and get any movie and uh when was the last time yeah when was the last time you saw somebody getting cornered at a blockbuster for buying a movie you know what i'm saying so 

180.25 182.13 B: (( people will always find a way around it )) 

184.52 187.50 B: yeah never yeah yeah 

186.89 195.04 A: uh it's it's kinda futile they're trying but it's not really working i now when i was young it was little it was even tighter than it is now 

188.62 189.57 B: yeah 

190.16 191.53 B: exactly 

194.46 195.55 B: yeah 

194.96 205.73 A: like you know the cursing and just the way things were but uh whatever i was still like looking at porn and you know yeah you're gonna work it out either way 

196.81 197.64 B: mhm 

201.82 204.20 B: yeah there's no way around it uh 

204.79 215.73 B: everybody's gonna find a way to get by anyway you might as well just make it easier not easier but you know you shouldn't try to restrict it the more you restrict it you know the more they want it 

209.06 210.37 A: (( right )) 

212.31 215.72 A: yeah especially uh you know um 

215.59 228.17 A: in television and stuff like that it really it it's it's confusing you can say this but you can't say that you can show this but you can't show that but you can make it as suggestive as possible but it's so you know it's just like 

221.11 222.48 B: yeah 

223.45 224.66 B: yeah 

225.95 227.01 B: yeah 

227.41 231.84 B: exactly there's there's like this hard hard to limit what you can and what you can't 

231.55 232.50 A: yeah 

231.92 241.77 B: especially because children uh there's no set time when they go to sleep or like that prime time you know the time slot and that stuff doesn't really work anymore because children can be awake or 

239.48 240.70 A: exactly 

241.29 244.24 A: and the fact that there's like a v._h._s. too 

244.01 245.50 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

244.38 246.39 A: in other words like um 

246.56 260.72 A: you know if i know like the dirty shows are coming on at like four in the morning or something like that and uh i would record it if i was like you know if i wanted to see it as you know whatever my parents are like no you can't watch it or you know somebody try to censor me and stuff 

250.37 252.46 B: mhm yeah 

255.35 256.60 B: yeah 

258.64 259.69 B: yeah 

259.84 262.28 B: exactly exactly 

260.68 261.91 A: um 

261.97 265.43 A: uh the thing in school um 

266.00 271.87 A: yeah i mean the thing is that what you complain about that's only gonna make people go out there and look at it more 

271.23 272.66 B: yeah definitely 

272.01 274.08 A: you know um so 

273.91 283.02 B: the more you restrict it yeah it shouldn't be it shouldn't be freedom to do whatever and look at whatever but uh it definitely doesn't really work whatever 

275.14 276.56 A: yeah the more 

282.92 284.44 A: (( big time yeah )) 

283.03 284.73 B: the way that they're doing it now 

284.54 296.36 A: yeah i mean like uh there is a responsibility i suppose like in a in in for you know for example school library the type of material that should be in there and shouldn't be in there but on the other hand um 

292.58 293.63 B: yeah 

293.88 294.78 B: yeah 

296.44 305.69 A: the fact that uh you know you have a kid that maybe just wants to freaking read you know don't hold him back like you know keep the stuff there whatever um 

300.76 302.25 B: yeah 

302.85 304.55 B: mhm 

305.04 306.89 B: yeah 

306.12 315.73 A: you know perhaps um you know certain materials uh you have to get your parents' consent to even read it or something like that but i think it should be made available still 

315.49 317.83 B: oh yeah 

315.90 318.66 A: (( you know as far as the books go )) 

318.63 325.13 A: um you know if you know let's say there was a book that uh was banned in my school or something like that 

324.93 338.82 A: um i would go on the internet it's different now i mean i'm guessing that really wasn't around much when i was in the you know like grade school and things like that but you know they're like no you know you can't read this read this works by this author or something like that 

328.16 329.26 B: mhm 

332.22 334.11 B: mhm same thing 

338.63 345.61 A: uh when i got home i would go online and like read everything about the guy i mean like i'd wanna know so um 

342.52 344.25 B: yeah 

344.83 351.98 B: there's no way there's no real way to censor everything anymore because there's so many ways for people and children to get their hands on the information 

347.99 349.72 A: yeah yeah 

351.72 354.90 A: and i mean like a curse word here and there 

354.54 356.33 B: yeah 

355.22 364.25 A: uh you know it's it's just strange how you can say certain things but can't say this and it doesn't really work like you know in the fifties um 

360.39 361.36 B: yeah 

364.23 372.01 A: on television you couldn't show a couple in the same bed together what what i mean like the dad like the dad it did nothing 

366.83 368.07 B: yeah 

371.36 377.62 B: yeah or or um uh women's uh what what women could show or or 

376.34 380.89 A: right and you couldn't say the word pregnant until like the late seventies i believe 

379.37 390.44 B: yeah exactly like uh uh lucille ball was the first uh women to be portrayed as pregnant or whatever on television yeah you couldn't say it but yeah 

380.91 382.03 A: so i mean 

385.43 396.99 A: that's right yeah but you couldn't say the word but you could watch all those shows she would never say the word pregnant i don't think they allowed that until the late seventies which is ridiculous i mean like come on and then 

391.16 392.30 B: yeah 

393.38 395.06 B: yeah exactly 

397.31 406.07 A: um you know on the other hand like you could turn on the discovery channel and watch like women giving birth and stuff so i don't whether that's right and then um 

402.79 404.84 B: (( mhm )) 

406.31 410.62 A: let's saw you watch howard stern and they're covering up the tits it's like come on like you know 

408.92 417.21 B: mhm yeah it's it's you're not really really preventing you know what the message is right there just by blotting it out 

414.94 416.01 A: right 

416.61 419.95 A: yeah i'm still seeing it and i'm still seeing what's going on 

418.31 431.78 B: yeah everybody still understands it so yeah it doesn't really make sense i never really understood that either where why would you prevent uh children from from seeing not everything but more like the world 

420.53 421.75 A: yeah 

423.85 424.76 A: yeah 

429.70 434.67 A: but you're gonna listen to the suggestive words of what's going on yeah 

432.08 442.69 B: yeah yeah i mean you're basically doing the same thing anyway and when they grow up they're gonna have to face everything you might as well ease them into instead of uh having it all you know hit them at once or 

442.12 456.84 A: exactly yeah and um you know it's all up to the parents and stuff like that i think a lot of the censorship should be um it should be up to the parents how they want to dish it out the government should kind of stay out of a lot of it and just let americans you know but there's more important issues that 

452.85 453.84 B: yeah 

456.47 458.79 B: yeah i know definitely 

456.82 463.30 A: you know really need to be taken care of and stuff like that um you know i understand keep the porn out of school obviously 

459.46 461.10 B: yeah 

462.69 476.47 B: because that's that there's no general place for that but i mean yeah there's certain there's certain you know kind of rules you you still have to abide by but on the general part you can't shield uh children from everything in school yeah definitely 

463.78 466.25 A: (( yeah )) 

466.51 467.67 A: yeah 

473.95 476.26 A: that's right yeah yeah 

476.52 477.60 A: um 

477.87 482.62 A: i guess to some degree i kinda understand like you know you don't want like 

482.59 494.56 A: a lot a lot of books and things like that i mean even going back to the eighteen hundreds were very sexual and stuff like that so it's like where do you draw the line like do you not have h._p. lovecraft 

488.97 490.14 B: yeah 

491.62 493.26 B: yeah 

494.29 495.53 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

494.45 502.84 A: in the in the school library do you not have this like where you know that's that's what really con- you know confuses me like where do you draw the line 

496.31 497.13 B: yeah 

501.12 502.79 B: (( mhm )) 

502.95 516.03 A: you know because like um there's some stuff written in the late eighteen hundreds that's highly sexually charged and stuff like that but you know classic works of art and um you know it's important stuff important works 

507.94 510.78 B: (( yeah )) 

512.07 513.93 B: yeah 

515.91 518.29 A: and leave that out of school um 

518.08 520.81 B: yeah it it definitely changes everything yeah 

520.06 524.09 A: yeah it doesn't i don't know if that's such a good thing but you know 

522.92 528.31 B: yeah it's not smut it's just that's just the the way that the works are written 

527.92 530.23 A: yeah yeah 

529.63 536.74 B: without knowing or knowing about it's just you're just adding the problem just like if you were to censor television shows or anything else right now 

536.59 539.79 A: that's right but it's just like you know um 

537.19 538.74 B: yeah 

540.07 545.96 A: back to television i mean you know you can watch a cable show and the person showing tits and everything 

544.81 547.02 B: (( mhm )) 

545.85 556.75 A: but yet on network channel like there's none of that but everybody has cable or satellite so it's kind of a moot point like what you know it's just like um you know okay like uh 

550.62 551.74 B: mhm 

556.57 561.10 A: there's no tits on c._b._s. well how about i just turn on showtime screw you 

560.13 563.13 B: mhm yeah exactly 

561.18 571.12 A: um so i mean i don't know if it's really working um i do think if if all the all the laws and things were lifted maybe it would get out of control 

564.57 565.87 B: it's definitely not 

568.60 569.81 B: mhm 

570.50 576.78 B: oh yeah yeah definitely [laughter] yeah shit there's gotta be some kind of rules yeah yeah 

571.26 580.27 A: [laughter] so um definitely it would totally be out of control everything would be porno everything everybody would be naked um 

577.57 589.97 B: yeah at least for now everything's like uh not secretive but you know it's kept on the download like people don't really talk about it as much and then that way it's kinda protected from children you know 

584.28 585.21 A: yeah 

589.26 590.53 A: yeah 

589.79 594.19 B: but uh if you just let everything go it's just people can say whatever they want 

591.93 599.89 A: yeah so i mean back to school i think everything should be available to a certain extent but let's say like certain materials deemed inappropriate 

595.64 596.77 B: mhm
