129.25 130.42 B: yeah they 

130.45 133.41 B: and um and maybe they monitor the call or 

133.50 144.15 A: [noise] yeah so um well i'm about to get into these weights lift these weights but um i'm thinking that going straight to weights might be a little too much so i'm thinking 

143.80 146.71 B: (( something )) 

143.93 151.38 A: i really need to do some calisthenics i was up on a hundred and forty fifth street and lex uh lennox avenue 

151.09 151.73 B: (( all )) 

151.42 157.93 A: in the park early in the morning the other day and i noticed that these fellows come out and they do um 

154.80 157.59 B: (( right )) 

158.01 171.56 A: um pull ups and you know and push ups and you know different things like that there you know just to get the muscles in shape because um since i haven't really been out there working my muscles 

171.53 175.09 A: swimming is a good sport too and i like swimming 

174.47 175.15 B: (( all )) 

175.37 185.30 A: but calisthenics you know is it's the um it's to help bring the strength back into your body [noise] and then i can go to the heavier weights you know start light 

176.38 179.13 B: (( right )) 

181.43 183.13 B: yeah 

185.33 187.71 A: and then try to start heavy you know 

187.51 190.89 B: yeah that that makes a lot of sense what you're saying to me right now 'cause 

190.90 193.76 B: i think i'm going to take that advice you know 'cause um 

193.74 204.98 B: i've been i've i've been trying to lift the weights a little bit lightly lately but i think i'm going to take that advice 'cause that that's sounds perfect 'cause um we have a a exercise thing right in front of where i live where 

204.86 205.76 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

204.89 210.68 B: like my neighborhood i'm from lower east side and on cherry street they have this park that has um 

207.15 208.65 A: yeah 

210.74 219.84 B: you know the pull up bar and all that stuff that dips and and this is this is ironic this guy was just telling me today that he needed a partner to work with to get pumped up you know 

213.35 214.97 A: yeah 

219.84 224.72 A: yeah yeah that's it's always good to work with a partner 'cause you'll time each other you 

220.29 221.14 B: (( and i was )) 

224.40 225.43 B: yes 

225.30 230.96 A: know yeah and um course the weights is basically for like um 

231.18 232.57 A: like for bulk 

232.92 247.36 A: you know blows you up but the calisthenics is for stress you know that's what that's for [noise] so i mean i understand it's very important for breathing [noise] i hope you're timing this 'cause i didn't time it 

234.46 236.16 B: yeah 

237.26 239.09 B: (( all right )) 

246.73 250.99 B: i think they time it they they they'll tell us when ten minutes is up they said [noise] 

250.44 253.81 A: oh yeah so so 

251.08 257.50 B: yeah i mean this this is my first call i heard the lady say when ten minutes is up she's she will tell us 

257.49 260.71 A: it uh-huh i think jogging is um 

258.37 259.10 B: so 

260.99 273.26 A: also very important it's um good for the wind you know it's to build the wind keep the blood circulating right throughout the body swimming that i know of it works 

271.93 274.89 B: (( yeah )) 

273.20 285.62 A: um muscles in the body that um we don't even normally use you know 'cause when you're swimming you want to be using a lot of muscles that you wouldn't normally work with in um 

282.43 283.59 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

286.37 289.43 A: [lipsmack] in any kind of exercises 

289.88 291.98 B: what do you think about stretching though 

291.74 293.26 A: stretching 

292.52 295.84 B: yeah like how much time do you think you should spend stretching 

296.60 303.70 A: mm i really haven't thought about stretching but stretching is interesting 'cause it loosens you up you get 

302.33 306.26 B: you see that's the one thing that's the one thing i have trouble with you know [laughter] 

303.74 304.53 A: get 

306.19 307.44 A: stretching 

306.87 314.57 B: yeah 'cause i get la- i don- 'cause you know i don't like i may stretch but like i don't have patience to be stretching for like a long period of time 

313.62 318.81 A: well i don't think you have to do it for a long period of time i think it's um 

318.87 321.58 A: like you could give it like ten minutes you know 

321.42 323.18 B: (( all right )) 

321.64 334.93 A: of stretching and limbering your body before you take the work out because i think if you go straight into the work out you'll catch cramps and different things like that now um i've been away 

335.45 342.96 A: i've been to prison once in my life and i went straight to those heavy weights and i lifted them that night 

342.95 355.95 A: i cramped up the whole night i couldn't sleep i tossed and i turned no matter which way i laid i was in trouble you hear me and there was no place for me to go to get relief 

347.06 349.87 B: (( yeah )) 

356.28 364.73 A: [laughter] you know so um that's stretching um i'm glad you said that because um that sounds very good 

356.92 358.35 B: [laughter] 

363.56 366.38 B: [laughter] uh uh what you're saying is the key 'cause i know what i 

366.59 380.18 B: like i used to be really big right but i started working out 'cause like i don't know i wanted to gain flexibility you know so i like now i've got a more 'cause i play basketball so now that i'm more flexible i kind want to get back on the weights a little bit just light though 

372.33 374.04 A: yeah 

380.02 385.83 B: but i lea- i learned like if you hard if you like really lift weights heavy and you and you haven't been lifting that much 

385.73 387.59 A: (( mhm )) 

385.87 394.91 B: you'll pull a ten- like you you stretch the muscles you rip them and so yeah that that hurts and so they have to grow be healed and grow back over it so 

388.90 390.61 A: yeah you rip the tissue 

394.80 403.55 B: i mean i know the muscle's got a rip so the muscle's can get bigger but you wanna you wanna be easy you don't want to like rip them too much to where you can't even open your arms is hurting you know 

397.85 399.04 A: yeah 

403.45 409.87 A: yeah well that's why you usually take a couple days of rest you know give the body a chance to heal 

406.46 409.53 B: yeah 

410.07 421.30 A: see because after they rip the muscles that's not used to the workout it's going to tighten up on you that's where you're going to catch those cramps at when you first start and um 

422.03 428.95 A: and as bad as my body is i'm going to cramp up all over the place i'm going to be in a lot of trouble 

428.62 431.93 B: wh- what kind what kind of um calisthenics are you trying to get into 

432.25 433.82 A: what kind of study 

433.22 434.56 B: calisthenics 

434.13 435.60 A: calisthenics 

435.79 439.14 A: i don't know basically push ups um 

439.74 444.05 A: i got a little gut on me so i need to do a little soft a few sit ups 

444.13 447.35 A: you know it's going to tighten it up it ain't going to shrink it though 

447.27 449.05 B: (( all right )) 

447.44 450.42 A: i need to also get into a diet 

450.87 451.86 A: you know 

451.47 453.21 B: yeah 

452.24 463.43 A: yeah i need to cut down the starches like the bread take the fat off the chicken um leave those potatoes and noodles alone start eating a lot more vegetables fruit 

463.47 465.15 A: things of that nature 

465.28 466.91 A: you know um 

465.97 466.53 B: (( [noise] )) 

468.25 473.25 A: i'm drink a lot more juices rather than sodas you know 

471.20 474.83 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

473.59 481.48 A: things like that there you know 'cause all of this stuff works together you know to tend to to help you out but um 

481.60 482.97 B: right i mean you 

482.08 484.97 A: i don't know i got a little high blood pressure too so 

484.52 488.97 B: you're kind of helping me out a lot man i'm a little [laughter] this 

487.22 491.79 A: hey well you know something you have said a few things that uh helps me out as well 

491.24 500.35 B: is kind of a good thing 'cause like what you were saying is like enlightening me i think 'cause i drink too much soda man yeah i definitely need to start yeah drinking some more juice 

497.45 501.01 A: with soda yeah [noise] soda blows you up in the gut 

500.91 513.28 A: there's a lot of syrup in there a lot of people think they get thirsty because it's the syrup that sticks to your throat and it don't quenches your thirst like water but what it is it's got caffeine in it 

500.91 502.95 B: (( all right )) 

513.10 520.06 A: and the caffeine sucks up the moisture that's in your body it dehydrates you 

519.97 521.72 B: (( all right )) 

520.43 531.13 A: see it takes the water out your system so soda is really no good for you um you need to drink plenty of water there's no substitute for water 

530.75 532.26 B: (( all right )) 

531.45 534.24 A: (( no substitute you know )) 

533.97 537.97 B: but but you said something about juices juices are pretty good you think 

537.17 544.59 A: yeah well i think juices are pretty good it's just the there's a lot of acid in a lot of juices um some juices um 

545.33 556.79 A: they put a lot of sugar in it so you get the pay attention to labels unless you got a juice maker you know and those health drinks are very good 

555.90 560.97 B: wh- when i was in los angeles i knew a man with the same exact name you've got robert watson 

560.75 562.18 A: oh yeah 

561.42 570.46 B: yeah but but i know he's not you 'cause uh like the voice is different though but i did meet somebody with that name before [laughter] that's amazing 

567.83 574.96 A: [laughter] well i got a funny story to tell there was one time we used to live in brooklyn [noise] 

575.31 581.02 A: and i got arrested i was young and i got arrested for sneaking on the train 

577.42 578.90 B: yeah 

581.06 582.97 A: and
