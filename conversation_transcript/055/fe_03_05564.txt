71.61 85.09 B: in more the emotional and psychological level but when you're looking in terms of personal relations with family members i didn't really have anyone in the proximity so it didn't affect me as much as someone else might of

108.26 121.48 A: uh she was on the way to work that morning and uh she left the house at the regular time to be at her desk by nine o'clock and uh luckily she had some some uh transportation delays on the way 

121.43 131.89 A: her train was the very last one to leave uh penn station on the way to the towers before the uh uh before the attacks 

131.81 133.23 B: [noise] oh wow

139.81 148.88 A: uh the people took her out of the train and upstairs into the street and she had a front row seat uh practically to see the whole thing happen 

148.65 150.81 B: that's amazing 

150.11 161.31 A: it was so difficult for me i was sitting here at home i was just catching uh some of the early morning uh news uh i'm an investor and uh i 

161.32 165.89 A: religiously watch uh the the financial just before the market opens 

165.12 166.54 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

166.09 171.72 A: and uh you know everything got interrupted that morning all of the sudden the the uh 

171.53 184.68 A: reports started to pour in and i was just frantic i had no idea uh where my wife was or if she'd made it to the trade center if she was in one of the hallways there 'cause she always walked through there on the way to work 

184.08 186.90 B: right did you uh get a chance to reach her 

186.62 191.93 A: no all the communication lines were down she had her cellphone on but all the 

191.73 202.54 A: cellphone circuits had been jammed and taken over by the support services so i it was hours before i heard from her i didn't hear from her until almost eleven thirty in the morning 

198.83 200.45 B: oh my gosh 

202.65 208.25 A: and i didn't know whether to get in my car and drive down there i didn't know what i'd be able to do 

208.29 209.47 A: the uh 

209.39 223.73 A: authorities immediately closed off access to the whole island they had s- shut off traffic flowing into and out of manhattan that day they put roadblocks on the bridges and they had stopped uh pretty much all traffic 

223.62 236.93 A: um all the trains that lead into and out of the city were completely shut down bus service was shut down uh even telephone service was shut down all of the public lines were overwhelmed 

237.43 245.05 A: uh so for us it was a very traumatic day uh finally she ended up walking out of manhattan she uh 

246.05 247.46 A: took uh 

247.48 258.10 A: some transportation that she finally got uptown and she crossed the bridge from manhattan over to queens on foot high up above the east river 

258.54 264.88 A: uh she was very frightened and uh you know everyone had no was really um 

264.92 273.99 A: up in the air literally and and figuratively trying to uh decide you know whether we it was a general all out attack on this country or 

274.06 281.00 A: whether it was something temporary whether there'd been an accident because at that time we just thought [cough] that uh 

281.27 289.66 A: it was just a a couple of airplanes that gone off course or something we had never really dreamed that it would be a terrorist attack 

285.45 286.53 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

289.31 294.31 B: [noise] right how was the reaction in the neighborhood um which you're in 

294.63 302.19 A: um well [mn] the neighborhood that i'm in is pretty far away we're in a very residential part we're all 

302.08 311.13 A: single family homes that are set back from the street and and uh you know with trees and lawns and and uh single family homes so 

311.05 322.77 A: uh for us in the neighborhood there really wasn't the same kind of community that there is in other parts of the city but i can tell you that uh the people that i talked to here my neighbors and my friends 

322.73 332.13 A: uh we had sort of bipolar days after um [noise] after the attack uh we would alternate between rage and despair 

332.04 344.66 A: on a regular basis i mean uh we were just so angry that uh that uh these people who we'd never done anything do had chosen to attack us in such a vicious and violent way 

344.65 350.48 A: uh at that time there was not even a count of how many people had been killed in the attacks 

348.98 351.68 B: (( um )) 

350.49 365.16 A: there wasn't even a an estimate on on uh how we were going to go about finding the people responsible for it and how we were going to punish them you know so um and then there was also after the towers collapsed 

365.15 376.50 A: um there was also a pall of smoke and uh concrete dust and the smell of burning insulation that the wind which is pretty much from west would blow 

376.47 391.30 A: across the whole city and every time we turned around we'd be reminded of it and every time that we drove you know near the area or close to the area we'd see it and it would be like like uh having been through oral surgery having a tooth pulled 

391.12 392.34 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] oh [noise] )) 

391.24 405.33 A: every time you looked at the skyline you'd see that gap there and and we'd feel it uh once again it took months and months for that to to uh to leave our sights and to leave uh being a constant reminder for us 

405.58 417.78 B: that's wow i think you are probably the first person i've talked to who's been through that [mn] emotionally or as deeply as [noise] uh you can tell 

418.19 424.62 B: [noise] i think [noise] with me there was a f- close friend of mine who actually was almost on one of those planes 

425.00 428.50 B: um she had missed her flight that morning from boston 

428.72 434.11 B: and she was [noise] going to be on the plane that wa- uh ran into the south tower 

428.77 431.29 A: (( mm yeah that was one and the same to get )) 

433.99 434.75 A: mm 

434.16 434.91 B: um 

435.73 441.16 B: [noise] and i can't imagine what your wife actually went through 

441.49 444.85 A: well my wife went through well one of those uh 

444.99 451.33 A: extremely harrowing extremely personal extremely uh deeply um 

451.34 456.07 A: affecting experiences and and it was just as difficult for me i think uh 

455.92 468.49 A: you know having three [mn] hours of not knowing whether you life has been completely destroyed um it was a very difficult thing to go through as well um this is why i'm so angry now 

468.42 472.64 A: uh i just heard from the committee that uh 

472.58 476.31 A: the government appointed to look into the nine one one tragedy 

476.25 489.69 A: that'll see what lessons can be learned from it i'm very disappointed and angry to learn that the republican congress and also the administration has been steadily blocking efforts to uh get information out on it 

484.87 485.54 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

487.69 488.39 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

488.78 490.32 B: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

489.73 490.77 A: um 

490.79 499.72 A: they they claim that uh especially the justice department under ashcroft and the department of defence under rumsfeld have not been forthcoming 

499.66 502.09 A: with what they knew and when they knew it 

501.90 510.55 A: we're learning uh bits and pieces now that uh actually all the major intelligence services including the c._i._a. including the f._b._i. 

506.77 508.02 B: (( mm )) 

510.37 520.84 A: had been receiving a steady stream of warnings all through the summer and in fact uh ashcroft himself had had stopped flying on commercial aircraft 

521.64 531.04 B: but what do you think about the uh conspiracy theory that bush actually knew about the attacks beforehand and allowed it to actually go through as an effort to unite the nation 

521.66 523.06 A: [cough] but none of this 

531.07 534.87 B: uh just because the nation was so split after his election [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

534.98 549.91 A: well i you know th- though though that's speculation i'm i'm talking about you know what these this commission that we're paying for with taxpayer dollars is supposed to be looking into and they're actively being stopped from opening some files and they're 

549.80 560.26 A: and uh in fact uh people in the justice department are being told that they can't speak to the commission without another person being present and i thought we lived in america 

560.78 567.70 A: you know i i i think that uh as citizens we have to find out more about this and start writing our congresspeople 

567.55 582.41 A: that uh it's not going to be enough for them to just shut the door and say well that's it you know no more we're not going to tell you any more about we don't want to be embarrassed or we don't want to be implicated or we don't want you to know what what we know i don't think that's acceptable in in in america 

582.93 590.54 A: so uh you know that's one thing that's really disturbing me about it at present uh the other stuff as far as uh 

590.43 599.99 A: did he turn his back on purpose or or whatever you know that may come out in the wash or may not i'm just concerned that the fact finding that we're going to pay
