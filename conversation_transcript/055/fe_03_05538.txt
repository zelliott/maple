34.16 36.88 A: did you exercise before 

36.03 41.74 B: before i was uh my high school years my exercise was uh sports 

42.39 44.08 A: what kind of sports did you do 

43.71 45.25 B: i wrestled and

45.77 47.30 B: (( we ran a lot uh )) 

47.67 50.36 B: yeah i'm in uh indiana 

49.45 51.42 A: oh i see okay 

51.79 55.06 B: how was your exercise during your younger years mm [noise] 

55.30 61.69 A: um well i did gymnastics for a long time and then i was i jogged a lot and um 

62.13 69.02 A: but then when i entered grad school i i really stopped exercising regularly but well off and on 

69.95 71.18 A: some 

71.36 77.84 A: some years is easier than others it seems like you know when you get too busy you just don't have time to to exercise so much 

76.12 77.00 B: yeah 

77.52 78.63 B: yeah 

78.16 79.62 A: are you in school 

79.23 80.67 B: uh-huh college 

80.43 87.51 A: in college yeah so is that do you think that's why you stopped re- exercising regularly 

86.08 87.31 B: (( that really )) 

87.43 88.29 B: yeah 

87.62 89.12 A: with i'm sorry 

88.44 91.07 B: [cough] time conflict i would say 

91.55 96.37 B: that and uh after yeah i get off work i'm pretty tired 

96.17 97.97 A: right 

96.65 99.78 B: but i think that's one of the major reasons 

99.44 103.37 A: right what kind of work do you do do you work at like computers 

102.22 104.80 B: i'm in a i'm in a factory 

104.22 106.34 A: in a factory 

104.81 108.35 B: yeah it's uh manual labor type of stuff 

107.73 111.68 A: so i guess uh that's some kind of exercise you know 

110.81 115.20 B: yeah i'm running back and forth uh along the uh line 

115.87 119.67 A: right well do you feel like you're out of shape or 

119.42 122.82 B: no no i i can run pretty good [noise] um [noise] [noise] 

125.94 136.34 A: yeah i i'm i always work near a computer so i i feel pretty much like you know if you work at a computer you need to sort of exercise sometimes 

134.70 135.79 B: yeah 

135.84 139.51 B: yeah oh i'm up on my feet the whole time but 

139.86 144.37 A: so it's understandable why you don't want to [laughter] exercise maybe so much 

141.80 143.07 B: (( um yeah )) 

145.01 148.81 B: how often do you or how often would you say you exercise 

149.51 161.23 A: um i'd say three times a week but like i just got back from jogging and then i was watching [laughter] the simpsons and i um when i'm watching the simpsons i do sort of like a sit up type of thing so 

160.11 161.55 B: (( okay [noise] mhm )) 

162.55 172.14 A: [noise] that i do regularly but i still feel out of shape [laughter] i guess we all do you know body image type of thing 

169.42 170.54 B: yeah 

174.32 175.83 A: um 

176.07 181.53 B: yeah i i did the uh sit up routine snuck it in a snuck it in a few times uh 

181.57 189.47 B: in the early mornings and sometimes in the late afternoons but sometimes i just don't feel like it 

186.55 187.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

189.28 190.79 A: yeah it's 

191.22 196.86 A: see i think it's especially easy during the winter to get out of shape 

194.11 195.72 B: yeah 

197.06 198.11 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

197.21 198.30 B: yeah 

200.39 204.72 A: so what were some of the other i forget some of the other questions 

204.89 205.69 A: [mn] 

205.41 208.34 B: um i don't have it in front of me 

208.11 213.03 A: yeah just by memory do you remember anything that they said at the beginning 

214.57 217.26 B: um i remember the part about them saying 

217.42 224.05 B: uh if you don't would you want to start i i heard that 

221.80 223.58 A: (( [noise] right )) 

224.22 225.85 A: right 

224.30 225.50 B: (( um [cough] yah )) 

226.51 236.53 A: i guess and then we just come up with other topics i mean 'cause like one thing that i immediately think of when uh this topic comes up is just that well you're a student so you probably get to use the um 

236.58 247.05 A: the school gym or something yeah i think gyms like i'm living in new york now and gyms are really expensive you know a gym membership so i think that's one 

237.80 238.60 B: (( oh )) 

242.98 244.01 B: (( okay )) 

247.23 251.95 A: that's another just one more barrier for people to regularly exercise 

251.60 253.37 B: yeah 

252.33 256.42 A: do you live in the country or do you live in a city 

255.60 258.81 B: um in the country but it's right beside a city uh 

258.83 263.72 A: i see so like commuting to a gym is not a problem for you or 

259.47 260.38 B: (( and it's just )) 

263.48 270.75 B: by the nearest gym that i can think of is called bob's gym and it's probably 'bout twenty to twenty five minutes away 

271.37 272.78 A: i see 

271.98 278.27 B: so nah [noise] i've got some buddies that i work with who go to bob's gym and work out 

278.29 283.99 B: and uh i think he said it's like sixty bucks a month that he has to pay to go to 

283.87 285.67 A: yeah 

284.56 293.10 B: it and he he tries to go down there every spare chance he could get and uh he's involved in softball and he's part of the maintenance crew uh [noise] mm 

292.59 293.63 A: i see 

293.95 298.47 A: so it's like a big part of his life working out and everything 

296.83 302.46 B: yeah yeah he's trying to uh break out his muscle if 

302.51 304.21 B: i can put it that way 

304.12 305.80 A: right 

305.16 309.20 B: but uh [cough] i think there's some cheaper 

309.56 317.10 B: [noise] places to go like uh another guy that i used to work with said he'd go to the y. and i didn't hear of him 

317.71 323.29 B: uh mentioning any costs but uh i would say that cost is maybe a factor in uh 

319.94 321.58 A: right 

323.72 329.67 B: you know lifting weights and such and then uh depending on your location how much you run [mn] 

329.37 331.16 A: right 

331.52 343.05 A: yeah i mean mm i live in a city but i guess i'm a little bit lucky 'cause i live right near the river and so i can run along the river but if i lived you know in the center of the city it might be a little bit more difficult you know 

342.54 343.72 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

343.08 345.66 A: when you're running through the streets and stuff 

346.74 353.58 B: yeah i took a trip to new york and uh i just saw this t._v. special about um 

353.66 356.95 B: joggers going through the the big park they got 

356.30 358.24 A: [noise] right central park 

357.10 366.72 B: and uh yeah how sometimes they'll have people attacked uh uh there's no i'm sure that if if you can't get a group together then 

364.60 367.57 A: (( yeah )) 

366.79 371.13 B: you just won't go which that's reasonable safety wise 

369.81 379.37 A: right i think and also it depends on where you go in the par- i mean a lot of the it seems like a lot of these people get attacked it's more um they're long distance 

379.42 388.04 A: and so they go to some more of the obscure parts of the park but there's like tracks within uh within central park that you could go to and it's not quite as dangerous so 

387.81 388.94 B: yeah 

388.40 396.06 A: i mean yeah i think certain cities like are more friendly towards people who want to exercise regularly um 

396.13 407.93 A: and new york er i think is like you know a pretty friendly city that you can't find places but of course that is another concern [laughter] that's why a lot of people probably want to go to the health clubs and everything if they can afford it [noise] 

406.77 407.61 B: yeah 

407.87 410.37 B: and then uh treadmills also 

411.08 416.33 B: spending money on treadmills so they can do it at their own convenience you know watching t._v. uh 

412.66 414.58 A: right 

415.88 417.65 A: yeah 

416.76 419.77 B: getting some running or walking in yeah 

419.75 427.10 A: and then space is i mean it might be a little bit easier in the countryside or in the suburbs but in the city it's a little bit more cramped space 

423.00 424.28 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

429.03 429.95 A: um 

429.97 433.25 A: but i don't know can i ask you how old are you you 

432.68 435.31 B: um i'll be eighteen [noise] i'm eighteen 

434.67 440.96 A: oh so you're pretty young so exercise doesn't seem [laughter] to probably isn't quite as important to you 

442.04 445.60 B: well i i try to do it when i can uh if the 

444.75 457.84 A: but i mean when you said uh you were you were in school you were wrestling so probably it it's not something that you feel like uh you haven't done in a long time so it hasn't caught up with you but i think as you get older 

447.87 449.10 B: yeah 

455.99 457.00 B: right 

457.75 461.47 A: a lot of people realize that health becomes more and more of a concern 

461.18 464.00 B: yeah yeah you're right 

464.89 469.89 A: so um does your family exercise regularly [noise] right 

469.27 472.77 B: um they're probably about with me uh 

473.09 475.04 B: with their their work [noise] 

475.97 478.01 A: where do they also work in the factory [mn] 

477.89 480.07 B: no no they're 

483.79 485.40 B: uh uh their jobs are 

485.15 490.39 A: but you mean that they get tired easily by their jobs and so they don't feel 

488.22 489.70 B: yeah yeah 

490.05 492.51 B: yeah long hours and such like that 

491.92 493.45 A: sure 

493.61 503.71 A: yeah i think that you know for most people that's probably the biggest issue is just finding the time and the energy to to exercise regularly 

502.89 504.46 B: right 

508.21 509.23 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

509.42 512.61 B: if you could choose [noise] on a place to uh [noise] 

512.92 516.02 B: jog would you choose out in the country or in the city 

515.96 523.92 A: yeah i actually went to school um in the country and i often i enjoyed jogging in the country much more um 

524.32 532.29 A: it's m- much more peaceful and it's not as crowded and part of the reason that i like to exercise and to jog is that um 

532.45 536.79 A: it just just sort of clears your mind you know it's very relaxing in its own way 

534.26 535.12 B: (( mhm mm yeah )) 

537.48 550.17 A: for me g- er the um the big hurdle is actually getting started but once i've started and i'm i'm exercising then i realize the benefits and i feel really great after i j- uh you know after i work out 

550.27 552.90 A: so when i was in the countryside i much pre- 

553.04 561.65 A: preferred jogging there than i do in the city you know par- and what you mentioned earlier about the um you know 

561.67 565.78 A: just in the back of your mind that something could happen you know you could get mugged or something 

565.85 568.40 A: you have to keep in mind those types of things 

567.89 569.84 B: so i i think that's why 

570.03 577.33 B: there are people out there that's looking you know for for jogging partners that's why you see them in pairs and such mhm 

576.95 579.96 A: right jogging clubs and yeah sure 

580.00 582.59 A: i mean it's just that much safer 

583.77 586.34 A: um but in the i i don't know 

587.00 591.78 A: besides wrestling did you said you ran when you were in high school 

591.27 593.34 B: well i ran uh 

593.54 595.29 A: track 

593.80 598.27 B: as a no a- as a a conditioning for wrestling 

598.32 599.95 A: oh i see was it like
