0.51 2.39 A: hey my name's matt 

2.04 4.58 B: hi i'm shelley how are you matt 

3.93 5.33 A: good how you doing 

4.75 6.79 B: i'm good 

5.76 8.42 A: good well have you talked about this yet with anyone 

8.16 9.13 B: nope 

8.80 14.71 A: okay well i have so i 

15.31 20.72 A: okay let me think what did i say last time i about smoking 

20.13 21.47 B: mhm 

21.57 24.79 A: i personally don't smoke 

25.11 26.16 A: but i'm 

27.10 36.22 A: i'm not exactly sure what my uh stand on this issue is but i think that um it would be leaning more toward 

31.99 33.09 B: mhm 

36.33 41.87 A: banning it if it does actually you know hurt other people 

41.53 42.50 B: uh-huh 

42.02 45.93 A: but it would be if it's in an area that doesn't 

46.20 48.61 A: really affect anyone else 

49.17 62.18 A: uh then i would say like to go for it you know don't make no laws against it but then there's one more issue like because the government always has to pay a lot of the medical bills for people that um 

54.76 56.30 B: mhm 

62.99 71.80 A: um you know get sick from smoking for cancer and stuff and so in a way it affects everyone 'cause everybody pays taxes 

65.85 66.91 B: uh-huh 

71.18 72.20 B: right 

72.00 74.53 A: so um that's another issue but [noise] 

74.12 84.32 B: see that's an interesting issue because i didn't think about that i didn't i i personally do not smoke unless you know i'm in the bar and i've had a couple of drinks and i might pick up a cigarette 

82.72 83.74 A: uh-huh 

84.41 91.72 B: um other than that i can't stand the way that smoke smells i can't stand it in my house my husband smokes 

91.34 92.35 A: uh-huh 

91.73 96.51 B: and i'm constantly telling him don't kiss me i don't want to kiss an ashtray 

95.77 97.10 A: oh yeah 

97.39 99.04 B: so um 

99.08 108.81 B: and i don't like to be around it in public so you know that part doesn't bother me i know that it bothers other people it keeps them from going places and things um 

107.87 108.87 A: uh-huh 

109.36 118.96 B: but um yeah that is a good issue that you bought up about the tax dollar that it's paid by everybody including non smokers so 

117.95 118.99 A: yeah 

119.94 126.78 B: i i'm glad that they have the hotlines you know for people who need support to quit smoking and things like that 

126.67 131.31 A: mhm yeah i think actually it's definitely worked like as far as 

131.39 141.13 A: the opinion of americans who were smoking in the past couple years it's definitely changed like it's not as accepted as it was before 

136.08 137.17 B: mhm 

140.87 141.85 B: (( mhm )) 

142.02 152.41 A: and i so i would say that i think some of those things have worked i guess mainly because like the government i think actually what really changed was the government 

147.02 148.36 B: uh-huh i i 

152.45 156.19 A: talking to or making laws against it and stuff 

155.43 165.02 B: well you know that it's it's harder to smoke you know just out in public in a restaurant and things like that that and i think the commercials are really interesting about 

158.44 159.33 A: mhm 

164.94 174.44 B: um us getting good information about what is really in a cigarette and you know the birth weight of a baby and and you know the the 

165.10 166.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

168.64 170.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

174.70 178.84 B: corporations take on it you know they're in it for the money 

179.08 180.12 A: uh-huh 

181.39 189.42 A: yeah uh sorry my roommate's all making all this noise so i [laughter] i didn't get all of that but i think i get the gist 

185.25 186.80 B: [laughter] 

189.45 190.86 B: yeah 

190.04 196.27 A: um there's another issue i was thinking about too and it's all about it's kind of like a double standard 

195.96 196.88 B: uh-huh 

196.75 199.51 A: um in regards to 

200.07 202.47 A: like other things when you think about 

203.13 204.29 A: um 

205.24 209.04 A: at they really attacked cigarette companies for advertising 

208.91 209.80 B: uh-huh 

209.17 210.64 A: against uh 

211.28 215.04 A: like targeting certain groups you know to try to get 'em to smoke 

214.42 215.91 B: mhm 

215.05 222.64 A: and i would say that when you consider all all the negative effects that are associated with 

222.82 224.25 A: um 

224.37 226.69 A: binging and drinking and stuff 

226.82 227.98 A: um 

228.01 229.68 A: there's also a lot of 

229.96 236.85 A: you know it's one of the highest causes of death for people between like eighteen and twenty five car accidents from 

237.01 244.93 A: drinking drunk driving and stuff like that and so and then they use the same techniques of um 

237.79 238.89 B: (( mhm )) 

239.28 240.45 B: mhm 

245.03 246.88 B: well like glamorize 

245.21 246.01 A: like 

246.12 253.19 A: yeah glamorizing it on you know on t._v. cigarette companies aren't allowed to glamorize any more but you know 

253.46 256.43 A: you have like beer commercials that 

256.24 269.56 A: somehow so far they have gotten you know away without having to show any like some of the negative effects of it so i was thinking like the government should focus also if they're going to attack cigarette companies they should also focus on 

263.01 264.02 B: uh-huh 

269.83 271.26 B: the beer companies 

270.63 285.62 A: yeah and i have a one of my best friend he became an alcoholic and i mean there's so many issues just that goes along with alcoholism you know destroying families and other types of things and 

286.24 289.64 A: [sigh] you know like i would say they should 

289.70 293.78 A: i don't i'm not sure exactly why they just attacked cigarette companies or 

294.23 295.69 A: instead of 

295.21 301.31 B: well while while we're on the bandwagon maybe they should attack mcdonalds as well 

297.95 298.75 A: yeah 

298.90 300.39 A: [laughter] 

301.78 303.12 A: oh yeah really 

303.02 305.09 B: yeah 

303.83 306.21 A: for uh which what do they do mhm 

305.98 308.66 B: um you know they're you know that little 

308.69 315.92 B: kid's parents not very long ago i'm not sure where but they said that if wasn't for mcdonalds my child wouldn't be obese 

316.14 329.27 B: you know and the vitamins and nutrients that you know we actually take into our bodies the uh chemicals and hormones that are used to produce bigger cows quicker 

316.29 319.32 A: (( oh [laughter] [noise] )) 

328.91 330.03 A: mhm 

329.36 331.24 B: you know that type of thing 

331.77 338.37 B: and um you there we go back to the corporation again it's all about the bottom line so 

333.96 334.76 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

337.31 338.16 A: yeah 

339.34 341.21 B: yeah do you eat at mcdonalds 

340.97 343.13 A: (( [noise] no i don't eat at mcdonalds )) 

342.61 345.42 B: [laughter] oh you don't we eat there frequently so 

343.35 344.01 A: (( [laughter] )) 

344.87 346.00 A: oh right 

345.47 350.02 B: [laughter] yeah it's it's easy it's convenient so you know 

347.96 353.69 A: [noise] [noise] oh sorry for that beeping i used my phone hopefully it won't run out of bat- will not run out of batteries 

353.12 355.52 B: [laughter] 

354.04 356.23 A: (( [laughter] )) 

355.57 359.79 B: yeah i didn't know what that was i thought well gosh it can't been ten minutes yet 

358.82 361.68 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

360.90 362.89 B: so you know that 

363.51 366.87 B: if they're gonna go after the cigarette companies or 

366.88 374.87 B: alcohol or whatever it is you know i think that they should be truthful and honest about what they're going after them for instead of 

368.97 369.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

375.33 377.87 B: who's making who money 

375.97 376.79 A: (( [noise] )) 

377.13 383.53 A: mhm yeah i yeah actually you know [noise] there's another thing i 

383.55 386.45 A: it's kind of funny 'cause i'm taking an economics class right now 

386.56 388.91 A: and uh we talked about 

389.06 392.93 A: government [noise] how government taxes affect 

393.42 395.28 A: people buying cigarettes you know 

394.63 395.56 B: mhm 

395.49 401.69 A: and that's the thing like a dollar or two [noise] tax on cigarette companies or on buying a pack of cigarettes 

401.27 402.16 B: uh-huh 

401.90 407.68 A: affects it very little [noise] like people still buy the same amount almost 

406.60 407.49 B: (( mhm )) 

407.85 412.43 A: and and that was one thing the government [noise] is trying to uh 

408.11 409.29 B: yeah 

413.93 421.94 A: they call them sin taxes like if you smoke or something it's kinda like you know [noise] you're sinning like a sin tax you've got to pay extra 

415.54 416.45 B: uh-huh 

419.83 421.32 B: (( yeah it's a )) 

422.21 429.24 A: and with that extra money they can pay for like [noise] health problems with people that smoke and stuff [laughter] 

428.73 429.74 B: right 

429.37 432.40 A: and so oh it was kinda interesting that to know their 

431.54 434.42 B: i can see their point of view there but um 

435.12 439.18 B: you know they're we're already so taxed i mean you know 

439.78 444.22 B: they're shutting down public schools and and you know they don't go to school 

443.07 455.54 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] ))
