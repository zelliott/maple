5.10 7.34 A: (( are we on [noise] are we on how you doing danny )) 

7.43 8.62 B: (( i'm okay )) 

8.04 13.39 A: [noise] [noise] okay cool let's uh it's kind of a bizarre topic i don't know it 

13.15 14.17 B: yeah 

13.58 16.06 A: was the last time they asked me about smoking 

15.86 18.12 B: yeah me too 

17.08 18.16 A: um 

19.24 27.30 A: interesting and you i mean i don't know it's sort of odd like i think it'd obvious that people would panic during a terrorist attack people panic during fire drills like 

26.59 28.45 B: [laughter] 

27.66 30.06 A: in general people are just stupid 

29.99 31.50 B: and panicky 

31.48 41.46 A: and panicky i i think people panic about propaganda about terrorist attacks i think if one actually happened people would freak out 

32.47 33.90 B: yeah definitely 

40.49 42.21 B: yeah i agree 

42.54 43.93 A: [noise] [noise] interesting 

43.74 45.32 B: you would you panic 

44.11 45.17 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

45.52 46.38 A: um 

46.73 59.38 A: i've i've never thought about just because like there are people that are paranoid of ter- terrorist attacks [noise] 'cause i live in miami [noise] and it's not like a prime target for terrorists [noise] you know like 

58.00 59.04 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

59.40 74.30 A: one a lot of people that live here aren't even american and two like [noise] if if they blew up the whole city people would be like oh miami's gone or there goes trance music you know like there's there's nothing to lose in miami so i don't think like 

74.51 82.20 A: anybody's here well i don't think anybody that's thought thought it through here is really like worried about terrorist attacks 

81.76 83.09 B: yeah 

83.06 89.36 A: i think it's people that just like watch the news and take it at face value they're like oh my god they gonna anthrax the mall 

89.13 91.78 B: yeah [laughter] 

91.08 94.80 A: i can't go to nordstroms now and buy eight hundred dollar shoes 

94.40 96.56 B: [laughter] 

94.98 96.13 A: like 

96.22 102.76 A: i don't know i live i live in a pretty interesting community where people think with their money and not with their heads [noise] 

102.27 107.70 B: yeah unfortunately that's not as unique a community as it could be [laughter] 

107.44 110.15 A: [noise] uh how about yourself as a 

109.79 111.32 B: i don't think uh 

110.47 113.02 A: (( like uh uh do you think you'd panic you think )) 

113.08 114.82 A: (( you'd handle it all right )) 

114.09 117.03 B: i i don't think i don't think i'd panic 

117.56 119.11 A: (( [noise] )) 

118.27 123.71 B: i think that i'm pretty good at recognizing situations as either something i can do something about or something i can't 

123.42 124.88 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

124.17 132.07 B: and terrorist attacks seem like they're pretty much cut and dry either you're gonna get fucked or you can around it you know 

131.75 133.32 A: yeah that's uh 

133.54 142.31 A: i i think i think if if it's a terrorist attack then right that's that's a point either you're fucked or you're not [noise] but there's no like there's no time to think about it 

139.31 140.44 B: yeah 

143.08 146.49 A: you know that's i think everything we've seen so far with 

146.63 155.45 A: like in the middle east all the terrorist attacks there was never like oh jeeze a bomb just went off what do i do like like the people that died died and the people that die 

152.13 153.47 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

155.30 156.29 B: yeah 

155.68 160.49 A: walked away from it like [noise] so i don't know perhaps um 

160.75 161.89 B: it it doesn't 

160.95 164.37 A: (( [noise] but i i [noise] go ahead )) 

163.92 169.09 B: uh i was gonna say it doesn't yeah it doesn't seem like something that's worth really spending a lot of time worrying about 

168.35 177.61 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i think like in general people are just you know like you said panicky [noise] and very group mentality i think even 

177.65 178.92 A: cause 

178.99 180.25 A: panic 

180.64 182.03 A: really easily 

181.85 182.84 B: yeah 

182.25 185.52 A: intentionally or unintentionally 

184.58 186.43 B: mhm 

185.87 186.55 A: (( [noise] )) 

186.53 190.68 B: yeah it's definitely what it seems like [laughter] 

190.05 192.94 A: i'm i'm just sick of the whole mess like uh 

193.44 197.48 A: the whole uh terrorist alert system and everything very 

196.98 198.14 B: oh definitely 

197.55 200.73 A: creepy throw back to the eighties and [noise] 

200.23 201.47 B: uh-huh 

202.63 204.81 B: it seems to me also like uh 

202.95 203.68 A: (( i don't )) 

204.92 218.46 B: i don't know like even if even if even if it was worth like worrying about or it seemed like it i i'd i'd kind of avoid worrying about it just like [laughter] sort of to sort of the resist the general paranoia 

218.76 219.73 B: you know 

219.03 224.63 A: yeah that's that makes sense and and plus there's just not much you do about it 

224.29 225.34 B: yeah 

224.76 235.68 A: like really i and i hate to i hate to speak ill of past events es- especially when they are random people i don't know but like september eleventh if they had stopped it that day 

235.59 241.70 A: like everyone involved in that was dead set on blowing up the world trade center and they would have done it another day like 

241.32 242.39 B: yeah 

241.79 243.01 A: you can't [noise] 

243.32 254.94 A: they you know when somebody's determined to do something like that and they have like the the the drive and and an endless supply of people like human resources 

253.07 253.98 B: yeah 

254.97 258.26 A: they'll just keep trying until it happens and like 

258.07 260.14 B: yeah totally 

259.56 261.33 A: there's only so much you can do 

261.39 265.14 B: which is why it's good that they're not rebuilding it exactly the same way [laughter] 

264.43 266.58 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

266.81 268.83 A: that's such a good point [noise] [noise] 

268.64 270.61 B: yeah it's pretty ridiculous 

270.89 273.66 B: it seems like the whole the whole war on terror 

273.68 281.61 B: is really just making people more terrorized like more more panicky more upset as opposed to make people feel better 

278.22 279.16 A: yeah 

281.92 285.09 A: if if anything they're well they're just getting what they wanted [noise] 

284.88 287.09 B: yeah that's totally true 

288.75 289.59 B: (( mm )) 

289.81 291.46 B: it's pretty interesting 

292.86 294.29 A: (( i don't know i think )) 

294.15 299.13 A: i think if anything concerned americans should just do more to increase global awareness 

298.96 310.73 A: that america isn't really the democracy that they think it is like these poor people read their textbooks and hear hear about a democracy and they think that everything that america we all sit down at a table and vote on 

302.11 303.18 B: yeah 

310.27 311.63 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

310.98 312.88 A: like okay so uh 

313.28 319.05 A: nine million in in uh aid for aids awareness in africa yes or no 

318.69 320.09 B: [laughter] 

319.07 333.15 A: okay got a hundred and seventy one million for yes and uh seventy two million for no the yeses have it like that so that people really think that that's how america democracy works but they don't understand that you know you pick someone and then they make decisions and 

325.22 326.05 B: [laughter] 

328.91 329.86 B: [laughter] 

332.91 334.00 B: uh-huh 

333.41 334.94 A: that that's what you get 

335.39 339.63 B: yeah or you don't pick someone and they make decisions [laughter] 

337.71 338.55 A: yeah 

338.84 341.53 A: yeah in- invariably 

341.95 343.11 A: (( i don't know )) 

342.05 342.95 B: yeah 

345.06 347.09 B: yeah i don't know i uh 

348.35 357.65 B: [laughter] it's definitely in the best interest of of of other people in power to uh keep people scared too i think i think that's a big part of it 

357.93 359.51 A: (( yeah i )) 

357.99 358.91 B: (( like uh [mn] )) 

359.95 368.14 A: i don't know i i think since then like every every huge terrorist warning has amounted to a big pile of nothing so far 

369.12 374.34 A: i i can't think of of an experience where they said oh oh we caught terrorists 

374.07 375.14 B: mhm 

374.57 376.80 A: and it was it was legitimate [mn] 

377.38 378.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

378.02 382.63 B: yeah it seems like i i've i've definitely heard about a number of like 

382.64 388.17 B: conspiracy theories to think that like bush knew about the 

387.31 388.67 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

388.38 390.90 B: nine eleven attacks or something like that 

391.27 403.19 B: and all those seem pretty unsubstantiated but the reason that people find those so appealing is because it really has worked out really well for uh the republican administration and 

398.09 398.86 A: (( [noise] )) 

402.49 416.84 A: yeah see i i don't know i'm i'm very anti the bush administration but i don't think i'd go so far as to say something like that you know i i will say that it's i think that's taken every opportunity to capitalize on it 

416.15 417.20 B: yeah 

416.61 422.57 A: but i i i don't think that anyone could have the capa- i mean i don't think any [noise] 

423.04 432.48 A: i obviously people have in the past but i don't think anyone in american politics right now has the the capacity to just let thousands of people 

431.88 432.80 B: yeah 

432.27 439.46 A: thousands of americans die i won't say thousands of people because we let thousands of other people die but i don't think anyone would let thousands of americans die 

438.66 439.70 B: yeah 

439.49 447.51 A: in our fucked up priority system of placing american lives over any others are we still talking about terrorism 'cause i don't wanna lie 

447.13 448.75 B: [laughter] 

447.74 450.08 A: do i get paid for this conversation 

449.45 450.59 B: yeah 

450.49 452.94 A: i hope we're still talking about terrorists 

452.37 454.21 B: i think so i think so 

453.06 459.26 A: [laughter] okay yeah i think i mean it's it's all like related to the the [noise] the topic of uh 

459.14 460.55 B: of panic 

460.33 463.76 A: yeah of panic exactly where where it comes from 

463.12 469.40 B: well it seems to me the reason the reason why people people do find it do find that theory that that 

463.78 464.76 A: (( why [noise] )) 

469.38 478.22 B: that it comes from uh that bush knew about it beforehand or something as farfetched as that is the reason people find that appealing is because 

478.24 485.96 B: the the panic that has been induced by terrorism really has made people just not question like the government and whatnot 

483.97 484.96 A: yeah 

485.35 495.04 A: oh definitely but that's why i think he's capitalizing on it but i don't think like i think there there are other ways they could have gone about that 

488.89 490.17 B: yeah yeah 

494.59 496.02 B: oh yeah totally 

495.45 498.48 A: (( like i i you know what i mean like )) 

498.93 503.08 A: anything from your staged assassination attempts to you 

502.79 503.76 B: uh-huh 

503.11 508.10 A: know just anything like that like there's there's a million other ways they could have rallied americans together 

507.45 511.70 B: yeah they just happened to have something convenient fall in their laps 

508.88 510.03 A: (( [noise] that )) 

511.60 518.80 A: yeah [noise] i think i think it's more of an opportunism than uh creating their own uh [noise] their own political 

518.92 526.54 A: i don't know i think i think we'll really see what happens as uh as the you know elections come up next year and uh 

527.30 533.13 A: we'll see if we don't go start another war and then have elections suspended for wartime 

532.53 533.64 B: uh-huh 

533.90 540.08 A: because that's that's a popular theory amongst among my friends is that bush is gonna try to pull something like that 

537.06 538.33 B: oh really 

539.76 540.82 B: yeah 

540.15 546.66 A: they you know we're in marshall law for the time being and [noise] we'll hold an election system when we're out of this war 

547.05 549.02 B: that's pretty scary 

548.45 551.15 A: and i mean constitutionally he can 

551.21 553.30 A: get away with it quote unquote 

553.00 554.03 B: uh-huh 

553.85 558.29 A: because if we're in a quote unquote war you know he has the right to do that 

558.39 559.54 A: so 

559.73 562.32 B: yeah that's really crazy 

563.11 567.04 A: [noise] like he can he can declare the american people in such a state of uh 

567.14 570.83 A: danger [noise] that he needs to be in marshall law [noise] and uh 

570.70 572.69 B: (( mhm )) 

571.63 573.50 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

573.30 574.24 B: wow 

574.01 584.53 A: it's frightening it's frightening that's what i panic about i don't i don't you know if somebody blows up the building i'm in i'm not worried about that i panic about waking up and not being a free american 

576.59 577.46 B: yeah 

584.20 585.25 B: uh-huh 

584.61 586.96 A: because because i you know 

586.97 596.76 A: i i panic about the government hearing this conversation [noise] and putting me in a prison as a hate cri- you know like a war crime criminal 

596.36 597.55 B: uh-huh 

596.82 599.95 A: and holding me indefinitely until the war on terrorism's over
