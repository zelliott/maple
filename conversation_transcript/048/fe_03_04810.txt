14.24 16.05 A: pretty good 

16.24 19.71 A: so we're just supposed to be talking talking a little bit about smoking and 

16.48 17.59 B: all right 

19.51 20.54 B: yes 

20.80 21.82 A: okay 

22.78 27.18 A: what what are your feelings on the ban on smoking in public places 

27.38 42.00 B: i i think that the ban in i think that they should ban it at least in the restaurants and that uh bars and other ways i i think they should be allow- allow them to smoke if they want maybe have some designated places 

43.24 46.25 A: yeah i think there should be 

46.31 47.68 A: designated 

47.93 52.67 A: places that smokers can enjoy and socialize but 

52.71 58.56 A: there should also be places that that they can't smoke so other people's health is protected 

59.16 60.51 A: definitely 

59.49 60.36 B: yes 

60.51 65.84 B: yeah i that's why i more or less considered the restaurants uh 

65.90 71.02 B: they shouldn't have it allowed there just sort of you know you can have family there with kids and that 

71.37 74.84 B: so i think they shouldn't be allowed to smoke there 

75.67 77.43 A: yeah definitely 

78.23 79.28 A: um 

80.09 81.90 A: what do you think about like the 

82.01 85.33 A: smoking programs that help people quit and stuff 

86.71 90.04 B: i i think that'd work if uh 

90.08 91.08 B: um 

91.23 99.44 B: i'm i'm not i'm not really too familiar with some of them i've never really checked into a lot of that stuff uh 

99.76 103.08 B: more of the stuff that i'm more familiar with is the 

103.23 111.26 B: nicoderm and stuff like that uh i think they're still a good idea you know if there's uh programs out there to help ya get through that 

111.62 113.14 A: yeah definitely 

113.25 114.60 A: i [noise] 

115.47 116.91 A: i think um 

117.47 121.08 A: one of the important things to help the smokers is like the 

121.23 128.15 A: the group sessions and uh they'll like someone to support 'em i mean a lot of its emotional where 

128.16 134.39 A: they're addicted addicted to it and you need emotional support to get off it 

128.56 129.39 B: (( yeah )) 

135.21 136.82 B: yeah most definitely 

137.76 140.54 A: uh i think the patch helps though i think it helps 

140.81 143.11 A: helps them get off the craving and 

143.60 147.93 A: slowly taper off how much how much nicotine they've taken in 

149.53 151.41 B: mo- yeah most definitely 

149.84 150.67 A: yeah 

152.43 162.11 B: i i could see that there's a people that especially the people who have been smokers for for years uh are gonna have a lot harder hard time getting through that 

152.85 153.63 A: (( but )) 

163.20 164.21 A: yeah 

163.40 169.82 B: and they you know they're gonna need they're gonna need at least something to somebody to be there watching 'em uh 

170.14 173.65 B: or just even talking to 'em 

177.05 178.14 A: (( definitely )) 

179.87 182.77 B: now have you ever smoked or anything or 

183.34 185.02 B: know anybody that's having 

185.28 187.62 B: trying to get through that or to quit 

188.18 191.70 A: i i haven't smoked before but um 

192.73 194.23 A: i know people who've 

194.54 200.18 A: who've tried to quit and the struggle to get off of it is uh 

201.25 202.23 A: i mean they 

202.82 206.34 A: they always have that craving and they're always you know trying to 

206.79 210.84 A: in the inside of 'em they wanna quit but the other side of them the physical part is 

211.00 214.81 A: wanting a little bit more of the nicotine and it's really hard on 'em 

214.51 216.30 B: yeah 

215.58 217.75 A: so have you been a smoker before 

217.81 220.20 B: yes i have and 

220.28 223.38 B: i've and i've pretty much quit uh 

223.47 233.25 B: when we found out we were gonna be having a little uh a little one around here and you know it's it's still hard especially when you go out places when there's people smoking so 

233.96 241.91 B: and you know it's it's it's quite uh quite a strong urge to wanna to light one up 

241.39 242.62 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

242.37 243.40 B: (( so )) 

243.04 243.70 A: (( was )) 

243.91 245.98 A: was it hard to get off of it 

245.69 259.09 B: um i'd say the first the first two weeks are the worst that's when you yeah that's like when you go through your you know your spitting and you know you've got a lot of phlegm coming up so it's [laughter] but it's it's it's it's uh 

246.48 247.31 A: for you 

249.49 250.30 A: really 

255.61 256.87 A: [laughter] 

259.14 261.72 B: (( and you know i i probably smoked for )) 

262.31 263.46 B: i'd say 

263.67 271.08 B: oh about close to ten years before you know we had uh my daughter and it was you know it was uh 

271.09 273.48 B: those two weeks were probably pretty bad 

273.78 274.85 A: (( mm [laughter] )) 

274.70 275.71 B: so 

275.79 277.77 B: but you know i i've tried uh 

277.92 279.53 B: i think it was the gum 

279.91 282.43 B: and that stuff it 

283.38 288.30 B: i don't know it was okay but it is a nasty taste nasty so 

286.42 287.54 A: oh really 

288.84 291.20 B: it actually almost made me want to crave you know 

289.19 289.75 A: (( [mn] )) 

291.27 292.66 A: [laughter] 

291.49 294.13 B: want more uh more of a cigarette so 

294.08 297.42 A: yeah [laughter] they didn't have the patch back then 

297.71 299.36 B: [laughter] uh no 

299.28 300.08 A: (( no )) 

300.03 301.18 B: yeah 

302.42 308.33 B: i'm just having uh i i've i'll just i'll be honest i i smoke every once in a while 

308.24 317.72 B: and right now i know that it's not uh smoking's gone up the price has has gone up too high to be having to try and buy 'em all the time so 

317.49 318.54 A: [laughter] 

318.38 319.52 B: it's it's 

319.67 321.13 B: outrageous though 

321.20 325.65 B: but i was thinking about trying the patch before but uh 

325.71 330.11 B: some of that stuff kind of gets costly on uh on trying to to get it 

330.47 335.23 B: and we had these uh natural pills actually to help ya 

335.54 336.27 A: (( oh )) 

335.96 339.18 B: actually not too bad 

338.99 339.81 A: yeah 

342.48 352.65 A: yeah and if it's like the cigarettes i know people who smoke smoke two or three packs a day and it gets costly and it runs up a pretty big bill 

348.90 349.69 B: (( so )) 

352.53 355.09 B: yeah that i know how that is 

354.84 355.91 A: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

355.27 358.28 B: i know we we're going through quite a few um you know 

358.39 361.64 B: 'cause both me and my wife were smoking for a bit and it was you know 

361.73 366.82 B: each having a pack you know you go through a lot of money a lot of money 

365.30 366.34 A: yeah 

367.50 372.58 B: yeah we saved we saved quite a bit when we quit i can tell you that that's that's for sure 

372.62 378.00 A: the total benefits i guess you get better health and save some money 

376.81 379.26 B: oh most yeah most definitely 

379.82 383.42 B: well i know i felt a big difference uh quitting after that so 

384.31 392.77 B: now you're you're able to your your energy level goes back up you uh you're you're gonna fee- you you feel it a lot more you know 

384.49 385.37 A: with health 

393.03 395.30 B: in just the things that you do so 

395.35 404.42 B: you know if you're out doing activities you know when you're smoking it's it takes a strain on you and then when you're you're not smoking you're actually able to do more so and 

403.92 404.82 A: huh 

406.01 407.79 A: yeah i guess that's cool 

406.35 407.29 B: you're you're 

407.81 420.46 B: yeah you're cleaning out your cleaning out your system there so you're not having all that that smoke in your lungs and you know it's all out of your system pretty much and you're not you know you're not having that uh 

421.14 425.03 B: that uh you know just kind of lingering feeling where you're just kinda ugh 

425.13 425.96 A: (( mm )) 

425.86 426.67 B: (( you know )) 

428.03 432.13 A: you're you're body can probably concentrate more on what it's supposed to be doing instead of 

432.23 434.31 A: getting rid of the toxins 

432.65 433.41 B: most 

433.98 435.43 B: yeah most definitely 

436.36 438.47 B: most definitely 

439.05 440.32 A: so did you 

439.22 441.41 B: and plus to get the huh 

441.70 447.76 A: did you and your wife decide together to stop smoking when you decided to have uh a child or whatever 

447.82 452.06 B: oh yes most definitely that was a big goal for us then 

449.29 450.14 A: yeah 

452.99 454.07 A: that's cool 

453.29 456.34 B: in fact you know she yeah 'cause i i know we uh 

456.37 463.54 B: i think we probably smoked the rest of the cigarettes that day when we found out and it was that after that we didn't buy anymore so 

462.64 465.70 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

463.69 464.71 B: it was 

465.20 468.63 B: we were like going cold turkey that's probably the worst way to do it but 

468.91 479.56 B: it's i think it's actually the better way 'cause you're not sitting there gradually trying to do something but it can be a lot harder on your body to go cold turkey 

474.05 475.87 A: yeah 

480.27 481.44 A: yeah 

481.48 484.21 A: so is that easier do you think um 

484.43 490.81 A: you know having the support of your wife like together stopping smoking do you think that helps 

490.88 493.51 B: oh yes most definitely yeah 

491.75 493.01 A: yeah 

494.62 498.54 B: i don't think you know that's why i i think it's a good idea to have 

498.69 500.11 B: to have uh 

500.19 504.01 B: like that group or that someone that's gonna help you you know 

505.41 507.49 B: get you know help you with your uh 

507.98 510.01 B: quitting 'cause you know 

510.41 516.15 B: you know just talking about it you know also helps you know so they're always there giving you a little bit more support so 

516.31 518.15 A: yeah that's true 

519.09 520.20 B: yeah it's 

520.63 522.29 B: it's some work 

522.46 523.15 A: (( it's )) 

526.34 527.44 B: (( and uh )) 

526.60 527.75 A: (( cool yeah )) 

527.54 536.91 B: i got family that's smoked you know for quite some time so it's kinda and they smoke up a lot of cigarettes [laughter] to many for me so 

534.28 535.78 A: (( [laughter] really )) 

538.99 541.65 B: yeah i just what was that 

539.42 540.91 A: just 

541.64 544.31 A: when you're out with your your child do you 

544.44 551.82 A: with your daughter do you try to avoid uh smokers and to make sure that's she's she's away from that kind of 

548.85 549.75 B: yeah 

551.33 552.92 B: yeah 

552.22 553.07 A: (( stuff )) 

553.47 556.75 B: yeah we always go to non smoking areas especially so 

557.31 559.84 B: i don't i don't wanna be having her in 

559.87 562.12 B: into that environment anyway so 

562.18 569.59 B: that's why i cannot make the you know even if they've got smoking areas i still think they shouldn't shouldn't have it anywhere in any restaurants period 

569.48 570.63 A: yeah 

570.09 574.11 B: yeah i i you know you can leave it for the bars and all that so [laughter] 

571.64 572.36 A: (( 'cause )) 

575.16 580.37 A: yeah if they need to smoke they can just step outside for a minute outside the restaurant 

579.07 580.11 B: (( what was that )) 

580.43 584.26 A: if if the people in the restaurant need to smoke they can just go outside 

580.66 581.71 B: (( yeah )) 

584.75 586.48 B: yeah 

584.79 586.33 A: for a little bit 

587.07 588.44 B: i agree i 

589.92 592.58 B: don't think it's gonna hurt anything so [laughter] 

592.39 593.50 A: [laughter] 

592.61 593.85 B: (( i mean it's )) 

595.21 599.42 B: you know i mean and they're not going to try ban a lot of stuff on the outside but uh
