0.06 1.80 A: hello this is omar 

1.30 3.20 B: oh hi this is yulee i'm 

2.92 4.17 A: how you doing 

3.68 5.01 B: (( good how about you )) 

4.50 6.38 A: i'm all right 

6.09 7.46 B: that's good 

7.51 10.59 B: well i guess we're supposed to talk about smoking 

10.02 11.13 A: yes 

11.11 12.94 B: (( uh do you smoke or )) 

12.13 13.29 A: yes i do 

13.02 18.82 B: okay um i don't um [lipsmack] how how do you feel about uh 

18.84 26.60 B: i guess the question they're giving us um [lipsmack] about smoking in completely in all public places am i right 

25.97 27.19 A: (( w- yes )) 

28.10 29.25 A: i mean 

30.08 32.01 A: [sigh] i wouldn't say that it's a 

33.88 44.07 A: i mean we already have you know restaurants that's s- particular sections for smoking and things like that but to stop people from smoking in public uh that then that's to me that's injust [sigh] 

37.71 39.48 B: mhm mhm 

40.76 41.79 B: mhm 

45.53 46.62 B: mhm 

47.13 52.63 B: [lipsmack] yeah i um actually i [cough] even though i mean i don't smoke it 

52.77 59.59 B: it you know it doesn't bother me that [cough] you know i mean i feel it's a person's personal choice 

59.22 60.64 A: mhm 

59.93 70.50 B: i mean i you know just because i don't and say you do i wouldn't i wouldn't say you know you know that gives me the right to say you know you can't do it [laughter] i mean i don't [cough] 

67.83 68.81 A: (( mhm )) 

70.72 79.70 B: i think too like if you know there are some people with health problems and that kinda thing that you know can't really be around smoke but like you said there are you know there are sections 

79.49 80.72 A: mhm 

80.10 83.58 B: you know and and i mean i think you know as long as a 

83.38 85.74 B: a person that is smoking 

85.65 100.43 B: you know is considerate about it and you know and likewise people who don't smoke you know are considerate about it you know i think you know it's kind of a personal choice of personal freedom and you should use courtesy and commonsense like you would with anything else 

92.61 93.56 A: mhm 

100.39 101.29 A: yes 

100.80 104.39 B: i don't see that they necessarily have to have a ban on it 

103.69 106.34 A: no that's i think that's a little bit extreme 

105.85 107.44 B: mhm 

106.81 108.68 A: do you have any friends that smoke [mn] 

108.56 120.26 B: uh yeah i have i have some i probably have more non smokers but um but i have fr- some friends that smoke and you know i don't again you know like i said that's kinda personal choice i don't have a problem with it 

121.25 123.58 A: i mean well i guess with me i've never really 

124.05 129.55 A: seen anybody dissatisfied because when you're out in public people don't even really notice 

126.31 127.44 B: mhm 

129.27 130.47 B: mhm 

129.69 132.75 A: m- d- at least to me um 

131.26 132.34 B: mhm 

132.84 137.18 B: [lipsmack] do you have a lot of friends that smoke or um or kind of some of each or 

136.67 145.53 A: some of each some of each yeah i mean like the ones that that don't they don't necessarily like the fact that i do 

137.29 138.44 B: mhm 

138.81 140.21 B: mhm 

145.23 146.40 B: mhm 

145.80 153.01 A: but they wouldn't as go as far as to say you know it should be banned in public places 

152.76 154.26 B: mhm 

153.72 161.93 A: and you know i i have some that used to that stopped and yeah i mean now that they've stopped it it bothers them a little bit 

156.31 157.42 B: mhm 

161.36 169.28 B: um i've heard of that too that it seems like it bothers them m- i guess probably they're more aware of it than even maybe somebody who doesn't smoke 

168.57 170.72 A: exactly exactly 

169.44 170.97 B: mhm 

170.86 178.04 A: so i mean i guess it it's it's a it's all a matter of preference to me and i mean as long as it's not done 

174.91 176.13 B: mhm 

178.41 183.28 A: and i guess in areas where where it would infringe upon other people 

180.92 181.91 B: mhm 

182.86 183.90 B: mhm 

183.30 192.34 A: i don't really think it should be banned maybe in private places but not in public places i mean 'cause there's actually some some restaurants that i've been to that don't allow smoking at all 

185.07 186.26 B: mhm 

187.38 188.56 B: mhm 

191.77 206.30 B: [lipsmack] yeah i've met a set this last while you know which i mean is i i i kinda found that surprising i mean it it doesn't bother me since i don't smoke but you know if if i did wanna go there with some friends that did or something you know 

205.12 207.12 A: mhm 

207.29 208.81 A: would it stop you right 

208.16 209.08 B: (( yeah uh )) 

209.65 210.54 B: (( i )) 

210.55 222.93 B: it would it would depend on what they wanted to do you know i mean if they would prefer to go a place where they could smoke and they would be more comfortable smoking i mean you know i'd rather go with them with a place you know that did 

223.15 234.11 B: allow smoking i mean you know it's not something that like i said that you know that bothers me that much you know i i'd rather you know just you know go you know with my friends [laughter] 

233.31 238.83 A: [noise] yeah i understand i i i definitely understand that i mean i'm coming to the point where i'm trying to quit 

234.48 235.76 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

239.23 243.30 A: so i guess you know this this it's interesting that this is the topic 

242.92 244.60 B: (( mm uh-huh )) 

243.69 247.61 A: that was chosen [noise] for me to st- for me to speak about [laughter] well 

246.09 255.41 B: [laughter] of all the things to make you talk about huh [laughter] yeah do you do you mind me asking um how long that you have been smoking or 

248.31 251.66 A: yeah exactly exactly so it's like 

254.93 259.54 A: uh prob- seven years yeah 

257.04 264.62 B: seven years mhm 'cause a lot of people again i don't really know personally but you know a lotta people 

264.45 275.73 B: you know have told me it's it's pretty tough to quit and and most of these people are people that i know that smoked like since they were kids practically or very young teens you know and 

267.60 269.36 A: mhm 

273.64 274.87 A: oh uh-huh 

276.08 281.94 B: and i i would imagine it is i mean i give you credit for trying to quit i'm i'm sure it's a tough thing to do 

281.45 283.71 A: oh yes i mean well because it's 

284.43 286.91 A: [lipsmack] it's not really as much of a 

287.40 291.82 A: a physical addiction addiction as it is a mental thing 

289.69 290.69 B: mhm 

291.05 292.61 B: mhm 

292.37 296.33 A: because physically there is an addiction to the nicotine 

295.98 297.37 B: mhm 

296.81 297.95 A: but i mean 

298.15 301.26 A: [lipsmack] like for me to go a few days without smoking that's a big deal [lipsmack] 

300.80 302.25 B: mhm 

302.36 310.92 A: 'cause i been smoking daily for a long time and you know you go through withdrawal syndromes uh some people start to shake 

304.61 306.07 B: mhm 

307.92 309.44 B: mhm 

310.58 312.13 B: mhm 

311.46 313.92 A: you get really splitting headaches [lipsmack] 

314.22 328.67 A: and the only thing that really cures the headache is to actually smoke a cigarette and get some nicotine inside your body but i fi- i've tried things like the patch doesn't work for me but they they have these new little uh log- lozenges out now 

319.90 321.07 B: mhm 

323.45 325.15 B: (( oh really mm )) 

329.01 336.58 A: that you actually that you stick in your mouth yeah and it's you you you supposed to put it between your your gums and your cheek 

330.73 332.23 B: oh okay 

336.76 343.47 A: and just let it dissolve there and it it actually does help produce the craving to smoke [lipsmack] 

338.31 339.65 B: oh okay 

343.00 344.30 B: mhm 

343.76 349.01 A: 'cause i guess the little pill they're they're about the size of a mentos look exactly the same 

348.26 355.59 B: oh okay yeah that's maybe just the idea of i don't know it's kind of a thing probably you're used to putting 

349.02 350.02 A: yeah they 

355.82 357.16 A: something in your mouth 

355.83 361.40 B: like a smoke yeah your cigarette in your mouth and so forth it's kind of like maybe the same thing you know 

358.18 359.26 A: mhm 

360.52 361.65 A: mhm 

361.45 369.20 B: uh in not quite but i mean it you know at least i w- would think that would probably be something that would be a little bit more helpful 

368.38 382.28 A: yeah it is i mean 'cause a lot of it is a habit of putting something in your mouth i mean 'cause i don't get anything from the cigarettes anymore i mean when like when you first start smoking in the morning you know when you have your first cigarette you get a head rush 

372.25 373.61 B: mhm 

375.97 377.35 B: (( mm mm )) 

381.92 382.82 B: (( mm )) 

382.13 383.97 A: over the years that goes away 

384.39 386.08 B: [lipsmack] i see uh-huh mm 

386.01 392.73 A: i mean at first it was a thing where a pack of cigarettes might last me three or four days now a pack of cigarettes lasts me a day 

393.33 394.44 B: mhm 

393.58 396.53 A: at one point i was smoking two packs of cigarettes a day 

398.58 405.61 B: yeah i guess you do it i guess you do kinda depend on need more f- from what i've heard like you said 

404.17 411.28 A: yes i mean there's there's ways that i've tried to to stop and anybody that you know that wants to 

412.10 416.01 A: to i guess simulate that sensation of having something in your mouth 

416.31 418.18 A: [lipsmack] some people buy lollipops 

416.45 417.46 B: mhm 

418.13 419.70 B: (( mm mhm )) 

418.47 420.78 A: and whenever they get a craving for a cigarette 

420.82 424.01 A: they put a lollipop in their mouth and suck on that 

423.12 424.17 B: mhm 

424.03 432.30 A: so i guess to s- i guess simulate the the feeling of having something in one's mouth 

428.08 429.08 B: uh-huh 

432.91 433.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

433.12 433.90 B: (( mm )) 

434.63 446.84 B: yeah well um you know i i hope that works for ya i mean you know i'm i wish you a lotta luck in that like i said i give you g- a lotta credit because from everything i've heard you know it's really a tough thing to do 

438.13 439.26 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

446.19 457.26 A: oh yeah the long- the longer you've been doing it the harder it is quit i mean i know people who smoked for thirty something years and they they finally stopped i mean some people had to have hypnosis 

454.32 455.38 B: mhm 

457.45 460.14 A: done to actually help them quit smoking [noise] 

460.52 465.48 A: but to me it's really a mind thing when a when i really wanna quit i'll quit 

462.37 463.46 B: mhm 

466.53 471.75 A: [laughter] 

469.06 470.72 B: (( [laughter] yes i think )) 

470.96 475.86 B: i think you're right that's probably a lot of it if if you're determined enough you know 

474.97 476.63 A: mhm 

475.97 476.74 B: but 

476.85 483.24 B: you know at the same time i guess there is somewhat of a physical thing with the nicotine too that it makes it that much more difficult 

481.20 482.11 A: (( m- yes )) 

482.62 483.58 A: yes 

483.60 486.16 A: i have no doubt about that i mean they have [noise] 

487.19 494.59 A: [lipsmack] now they have these things out they're s- supposedly called i wouldn't call 'em safe cigarettes but they're like smokeless 

494.38 495.78 B: oh okay 

494.81 500.26 A: and they don't have nicotine in them i think i saw s- i think i saw them i think they call them orbits or something like that 

496.56 497.40 B: mhm 

499.69 501.21 B: oh okay 

501.80 506.65 A: and what it's supposed to do it's the f- the filter when it 

506.68 510.23 A: really filters out ninety percent of the nicotine 

511.03 519.58 A: so it gives the person the actual sensation of of still smoking but they don't have the s- [mn] they don't the drug is not fed to them the same way 

512.88 514.30 B: oh okay 

514.31 515.31 B: mhm 

519.13 520.34 B: i see 

519.79 523.70 A: so it's kinda w- it looks like a cigarette it feels like a cigarette it tastes like a cigarette 

524.19 527.16 A: but it's not quite everything a cigarette normally is 

525.77 527.77 B: mm okay 

528.21 534.11 B: it still has little bit of nicotine but then it can kinda help ya get off of it a little more gradually then 

529.87 530.92 A: yes 

532.14 533.14 A: yes 

533.19 535.56 A: [mn] mhm help helping the person on 

534.31 537.81 B: oh that that sounds like it it could be helpful too 

536.92 540.65 A: mhm definitely definitely [sigh] 

540.89 545.22 A: wow i'm thinking what else can i say about smoking [laughter] 

542.87 556.21 B: [laughter] i guess so this is this i agree this is a bad thing to make you talk about probably just spending ten minutes talking about smoking i- isn't gonna make you wanna quit huh yeah [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

545.27 546.70 A: um 

549.13 550.14 A: (( uh ye- )) 

553.72 555.98 A: (( uh [mn] exactly well actually )) 

556.68 566.17 A: no well yeah actually it's kinda it's kinda put it in my head that maybe i should stop smoking cigarettes i mean i've been thinking about it as of late anyway i mean my mother she wants me to stop smoking 

565.63 567.92 B: (( oh yeah )) 

567.24 571.33 A: and she wants me to get into a little different research projects and things like that 

571.52 573.27 A: to see if i can get off 

573.41 580.24 B: mhm well you know that that may help too i guess uh but like i said i know it's hard to st- i mean 

580.15 592.86 B: the about the only thing i can relate to is even like w- when you said about like with the withdrawal symptoms i know i even used to have withdrawal symptoms from like trying to uh like if i didn't have my caffeine 

592.49 593.59 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

592.95 599.89 B: it's like when you said like about having to have a cigarette in the morning it's like if i i used to drink like tons of coffee and you know and tea
