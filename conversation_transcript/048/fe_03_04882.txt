10.70 11.81 A: so we watch 

13.22 18.52 A: well no so we've watched the same trials or media coverage whatever 

14.15 15.40 B: [laughter] 

17.56 19.32 B: sure [sigh] 

18.86 20.73 A: ye- yeah what's your feeling 

20.70 28.28 B: [sigh] well my feeling is that since the o. j. simpson trial i think that was the ultimate televised trial 

28.80 32.63 A: true indeed do you think that was the right thing to do 

33.03 34.79 A: to televise it 

35.86 37.90 B: well [sigh] um 

38.53 41.24 B: it certainly was good entertainment 

41.14 42.40 A: that is true 

42.46 47.02 A: i think it gave us all a little bit more insight of how it actually 

46.00 47.56 B: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

47.32 54.75 A: unfolds and ah more so than the t._v. versions of what you actually see and what goes on in court and 

54.81 58.02 A: how long it gets dragged out and how 

58.44 59.68 B: yeah 

59.09 60.82 A: how you know 

61.00 63.08 A: they put so many witne- it 

62.21 62.77 B: (( [sigh] )) 

63.65 64.59 B: hello 

63.81 65.35 A: does yeah 

64.74 71.51 B: yeah [sigh] yeah they certainly did and what they did was they wore out the jury 

66.40 67.47 A: it does 

71.70 77.43 A: [sigh] yes i think that was part of it and i think wore us out t- well not so much i think we were intrigued 

74.08 74.64 B: (( [mn] )) 

76.07 76.84 B: no 

77.13 81.21 B: it was it was entertainment you never knew what was coming on next 

80.65 86.20 A: yeah i don't have a problem with um i think they should do more of it it's 

86.28 97.43 A: i just like you know the six weeks trials and eight week trials you just can't stick with it ah who has the time to watch 'em all day and then you you watch the the ah 

94.73 95.93 B: yeah 

97.34 103.81 A: the news coverage and at night and they break it down to what they think you need to have seen that went on that day 

103.82 112.30 A: but i'd i'm a i i don't have a problem with cameras televising all the stuff that goes on i think they should do it more so we could see 

112.71 114.72 A: oh not only 

113.49 115.01 B: would you want it 

114.82 116.31 A: do i watch it [mn] 

115.32 119.52 B: if you had a trial would you want it to be televised 

119.91 121.86 A: ah yeah 

121.24 122.46 B: you would 

121.87 129.80 A: yeah because i don't ever expect myself to be in that position [laughter] if i'm in ever in that position where that it ah 

125.27 128.09 B: (( [laughter] yeah [sigh] [mn] [sigh] )) 

129.87 136.15 A: i'm on trial and they want to put a camera in on my trial then i want it there because i didn't do it [sigh] 

135.98 150.61 A: you know if they're gonna if they wanna put a trial in on marty in connecticut for whatever whatever crime i'm charged with they want a camera there they can have it 'cause i didn't do it they're not going to put it in for my speeding ticket but if they're going to put it in for a murder or a 

139.94 141.75 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] [mn] [sigh] )) 

150.57 151.52 B: yeah 

150.61 157.10 A: you know embezzlement or something then they can put it in there because i'm pleading for my life because i didn't do it 

156.88 161.18 B: well i understand your feeling and ah 

161.25 163.47 B: but you see um 

164.87 171.03 B: [lipsmack] o. j. simpson didn't care because he never he never took the stand 

171.30 173.13 B: which he couldn't have done 

173.30 176.92 B: his lawyers wouldn't of let him take the stand of course 

176.69 177.87 A: right 

177.35 178.99 B: because he was guilty 

178.74 179.91 A: right 

179.32 181.63 B: (( ah but um [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

182.16 187.29 B: bu- but [noise] you you could see how skillful the lawyers were 

187.38 193.43 B: in dragging out the case until they could turn the 

193.44 198.20 B: verd- the ah verdict to their advantage by saying 

198.73 202.02 B: by actually changing the subject 

202.06 211.48 B: of whether he was guilty or not and making it into the subject was race and the police were guilty 

211.63 221.35 A: true and and there why i think we all well two things i i i think it's like the kennedy thing i remember where i was when the verdict came down 

214.87 216.32 B: [sigh] i [sigh] 

220.93 221.77 B: yeah 

221.37 229.61 A: i happened to be at the time in a which isn't any more as you know and ah they had all the banks of the t._v.s 

229.61 242.44 A: on in the tele- in the electronics department that morning and i'll betcha the whole store was there around the c- you know the whole country was watching for that but you're right it did show you 

231.98 233.12 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

237.12 238.29 B: yeah 

238.56 239.66 B: sure 

242.38 256.44 A: the skillfulness of these lawyers and these top notch lawyers that they can probably take any situation and plug holes and put an element of doubt in your mind 

251.69 253.21 B: (( tu- yeah )) 

256.55 267.45 A: that you si- you know i'd a couple of times during the course of the trial i started to think well maybe you know but then at the end when it all pulled together yes he did it but ah 

256.69 257.83 B: yes 

266.72 277.15 B: no i knew from the beginning uh it was very obvious to me the fact that he drove away trying to get to canada was as clear as day 

268.72 269.52 A: yeah 

277.05 277.97 A: true 

277.23 287.28 B: because he thought he was gonna lose he didn't know how good his lawyers were [sigh] and and and since he had actually done it and they knew he did it 

287.52 291.77 B: i they despic- it was you see there wasn't one 

291.89 298.98 B: bit of evidence that anyone else might have committed that crime that was 

299.14 304.58 B: the the fact that he was getting ready to leave on a plane 

305.44 306.42 A: true 

305.50 308.26 B: ah so that he would have an alibi ah 

308.26 309.14 A: true 

309.03 313.15 B: all the blood that was found the 

313.17 318.13 B: (( everything every the every single piece of evidence )) 

318.23 320.25 B: wa- pointed to him 

320.46 327.69 B: and of course he he tried to get ah people to say oh it was drug dealers i had a friend in chicago 

328.07 332.51 B: a black friend who ah felt that the um 

332.46 347.11 B: [lipsmack] ah that that o. j. was being persecuted because he was black and i i said to her but he beat his wife so she called the police in desperation you heard her phone call 

346.89 348.10 A: oh yeah [noise] 

348.15 349.01 A: yeah 

348.44 352.45 B: i said what makes you think he didn't do it 

353.01 357.02 B: she said oh drug dealers i said oh come on there's no 

357.14 363.51 B: no piece of physical evidence that points to anyone other than o._j. 

363.96 366.35 A: true but i mean i think 

365.35 370.12 B: i and when when you have a huge accumulation of evidence 

370.15 376.44 B: masses of evidence i mean that's the way that's the way science works and i'm a scientist 

376.57 379.84 B: and there's no you have to say to yourself 

380.45 383.00 B: this is the only possibility 

383.18 388.14 B: no one could have covered up that well and planted evidence that it was 

388.21 389.83 B: (( o. j. no one )) 

389.68 400.70 A: [noise] but stepping back out of out of your personal opinions the trial coverage did show you that there are 

400.72 411.69 B: it showed you the skill the how a law- how lawyers can skillfully if you have the money to pay for a very good lawyer that's what it taught me 

400.83 401.58 A: (( wo- )) 

402.52 403.33 A: of 

411.34 412.21 A: (( yike )) 

411.96 419.12 B: that in america if you can get the best lawyers and they can pick a jury really well 

419.60 421.69 B: [sigh] and they can 

421.89 430.43 B: drag out a case to the point where they can get a f- f- ah focus on something which will 

430.75 441.91 B: ah which will bring in the verdict they want well if you can d- then just having the money if o. j. hadn't had the money he would have been convicted and he would have gone 

441.94 442.81 B: to jail 

442.67 455.51 A: true but you did also see how the system works of the side bars and the you know the you know you would think you know does somebody have to be on the stand for four or five days 

449.09 450.31 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

455.40 467.51 A: to give their testimony and you know to me that was you know there's gotta be a better way to do it than that you arrived at what time and what did you do and what did you say to this one and what did you 

465.69 467.50 B: (( mhm sure )) 

467.44 480.44 A: you know the ah you know some of those people were on the stand for three or four days and if you were home watching it every day i wasn't but if you were you'd i don't think you could actually stay with it for three days in a row 

467.57 468.13 B: (( [sigh] )) 

480.14 493.30 B: well i think that you also i you learned a lot about what is needed for reform of our system and why in places where they use judges to decide cases 

492.63 494.13 A: yeah exactly 

493.24 497.90 B: that's often they often get a much better verdict 

498.10 503.19 B: in terms of guilt and innocent and so on than than um a jury [mn] [sigh] 

502.03 512.50 A: and they move it along better and it yeah yeah i think you're right that that that showed me also that i think the jury system is yes it is our peers but 

512.55 517.62 A: ah they play to the jury and they and they both did both sides played 

516.93 517.87 B: yeah 

517.50 528.73 A: ah they're both you know one side is guiltier than the other but they're both guilty and ah whereas a regular judge without a jury pr- keeps it moving along and well 

527.81 531.10 B: yeah why don't they have a system of four judges 

531.44 533.44 B: (( ah and um )) 

533.81 536.83 B: for ah for cases 

536.55 548.73 A: you'd probably have to have thr- an odd number so it was a so a a verdict could be it couldn't be an even number and then it would be locked well i guess you could but then you would have a locked jury or a locked judges [laughter] 

540.42 541.35 B: yeah 

546.77 553.23 B: and you would have to do the case again but when you consider the costs of the ah 

553.46 557.82 B: [lipsmack] of the prosecution the costs to the state 

553.81 555.62 A: the cost is astro- 

557.14 561.26 A: yeah that's the astronomical and the unfortunate part is now they 

559.01 560.42 B: mhm 

561.11 572.81 A: that shows you also that they weigh bringing a case to court based on what it might cost and they're not sure if they could get a verdict which should not be the way 

573.12 579.02 A: ah you know sometimes you this i guess the state weighs what it's going to cost us 

573.39 574.63 B: (( yeah it right )) 

579.41 591.52 A: based also on the length and all this and what are our chances of getting a verdict in our favor or shall we go through with this case or not which doesn't seem right either 

580.23 581.19 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

591.96 599.89 B: no and ah but anyhow i think ah yeah televised cases do allow us to examine 

592.05 592.97 A: (( ah ))
