277.46 279.75 A: [lipsmack] yeah that's interesting um 

279.84 287.90 A: as as far as the subject goes however yeah [laughter] however as far as the subject as far as the subject goes um 

282.71 286.39 B: [laughter] yeah i know we're we're supposed to stay on the subject [laughter] 

288.07 294.79 A: i believe i have a tendency to believe that the people in new york would be much more 

294.87 300.99 A: apt to uh panic or [laughter] to be concerned than any place else 

300.38 305.39 B: oh sure that that would be um well ev- even if there wasn't any 

305.43 313.01 B: family involved in it or if you were there and you did the clean up and stuff that that has a great impact on you 

311.28 312.29 A: [sigh] 

312.62 322.09 A: and of course the the terrorism is all hinged on religion and i just don't understand i i don't know of any religion that 

322.25 326.43 A: advocates uh killing somebody for no reason at all 

326.35 327.32 B: no 

326.84 334.53 A: just uh but they believe that they have a reason that's that's the that's the the sick part about it they believe that 

334.33 347.30 A: the the there's a reason to kill us because we're a a wealthy country our our homeless are better off [laughter] than most most people in the in the rest of the world 

340.00 340.88 B: yeah 

347.74 358.45 A: which is really too bad i mean it really is i mean i'd like to be the policeman of the world but we can't do that were you were you for the war or against the war 

349.54 350.61 B: yeah 

355.25 356.06 B: no 

358.38 359.92 B: oh i was for it 

359.29 361.70 A: [lipsmack] yeah i was i was too 

361.21 362.75 B: definitely for it 

361.86 369.83 A: and i believe that it i believe that it put a dent in terrorism it didn't stop it obviously but i think it put a dent in it 

362.83 364.69 B: it needed to be done 

369.52 370.71 B: yeah 

370.28 382.35 A: and uh as long as we can dent it up a little bit you know here and there boy it's expensive though and that's what i do panic about is the expense of [laughter] of trying to cure this problem 

381.89 384.51 B: [mn] oh i know it's it's outrageous 

384.39 386.93 A: the expense is tremendous 

387.29 393.93 A: anyway uh we're supposed to you you must have another opinion about it we're supposed to talk eight minutes at least 

393.37 396.83 B: at least i know and then they finally have you talked before on 

396.38 400.50 A: oh yeah oh yeah i've met a lotta interesting people 

397.28 398.20 B: (( oh you have )) 

399.92 401.02 B: oh really 

400.53 403.15 A: yeah i mean is this the first time for you 

401.20 402.10 B: yeah 

403.06 416.32 B: uh this is the second time for me uh but i didn't really quite hear that when they told us the questions i didn't quite hear the beginning of it and i tried to get away from doing it and i wasn't 'cause i wasn't sure 

404.85 406.29 A: oh yeah 

416.44 419.27 B: what the question was and [laughter] you aren't sure you've heard 

419.11 426.78 A: no well it was it was the terrorism and how do you feel about and would you panic if it happened and i believe that uh 

426.81 434.97 A: uh your answer was yes you would and hopefully there's a guy like me around that could help you out that doesn't panic [laughter] 

429.21 430.00 B: (( oh i )) 

432.53 433.49 B: sure 

433.94 436.20 B: i would i would be just like 

436.96 438.75 B: i'd probably pass out 

438.16 443.96 A: [laughter] well you'd be easier to drag around that way 

441.42 442.41 B: yeah 

442.77 446.18 B: that's that's you know yeah i would get so 

446.29 452.37 B: i would just pass out just looking at it 'cause i sometimes when i walk in a hospital and i see stuff i just pass out 

452.07 456.00 A: my son is exactly the same way i had to when his w- 

453.60 458.01 B: yeah so you know i wouldn't be a very good help [laughter] 

457.19 467.31 A: when when when his wife got uh cut i had to come there because he was he was ready to just faint you know 'cause her hand or her head was bleeding she she fainted on 

465.67 466.46 B: yeah 

466.82 474.00 B: yeah well see that happened to me my daughter she hit her head on her bed and she had a gouge on the top of her 

468.38 469.26 A: [laughter] 

474.07 478.17 B: eyebrow and it was bleeding and i couldn't help her [laughter] 

477.30 479.85 A: [laughter] oh god and 

480.11 487.80 A: there's there's there's no way that you can you know get i guess not 'cause my son can't either you know he just can't i mean that's 

487.15 490.97 B: i mean it's just something that you know i don't know how you would overcome it 

490.90 500.63 A: well you know and and here we're gonna we're gonna have probably a grandchild here in the next year or so from from him i'm i'm gonna have to be the guy oh my god 

500.00 501.13 B: [laughter] 

500.46 506.89 A: [laughter] to take care of it 'cause he just don't do it he just can't do it [lipsmack] 

506.15 509.41 B: well for a child it's sometimes different 

509.52 515.88 A: anyway uh talking about bringing a child into this world with uh with terrorism going on is uh 

513.51 516.97 B: with all this craziness yeah kinda scary 

516.57 518.96 A: is is a scary situation 

518.96 532.98 A: but you know i'll tell ya i think we as americans and i really say that proudly that um we we tend to to stick together no matter what color religion or whatever we are when something happens that affects us all 

532.98 543.18 A: we tend to transcend all ethnic and color groups and what have you and i'm i'm really proud of that that's that's that's neat i mean we've proven that in the past so 

533.16 534.11 B: (( hell yeah )) 

542.43 544.08 B: oh yeah we've done 

543.28 549.48 A: so as a group of people we're pretty hard and i'll tell you you're gonna have to be a pretty tough cookie to mess with us 

549.44 555.67 A: and you know and and i don't mean to sound like a a fighting man i i am a fighting man not physically fighting 

555.51 567.99 A: but i don't mean to sound warrior if you will but i'm saying that that that we'll shake your hand and respect you but if you don't respect us then you you need to get out of the way [laughter] 

567.22 568.65 B: exactly 

568.36 570.78 A: you know you need to get out of the way 'cause 

570.85 575.29 A: we're gonna do what what what what's right and you know that's 

572.30 573.19 B: needs 

574.24 578.92 B: but we've finally done everything right and uh only tried to help everybody and 

578.82 583.27 A: we're doing you know they don't seem to appreciate it i mean they really don't 

582.70 583.67 B: no 

583.39 595.42 A: and you know another thing i i speaking of terrorism in turkey we were going to give thirty billion dollars to turkey well i mean i'm just wondering why we just can't take that money and put it in schools [laughter] can't do that though 

593.58 594.63 B: yeah well 

594.76 597.62 B: are your are your schools hurting in california 

598.01 599.89 A: oh yeah oh you know
