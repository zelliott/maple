150.18 151.08 B: mhm 

150.80 155.34 A: but uh he's had a really really tough time with it 

154.74 155.86 B: yeah 

155.33 169.21 A: he said he gets around it and then the craving just gets as long as he can stay away from it but once he gets around it and and he even if he just if he sees it he says it just like triggers this whacked out mental process and 

168.58 169.60 B: i know 

169.59 171.33 A: he just starts craving it mhm 

171.08 178.57 B: yeah i've tried to quit oh my gosh like three times i mean i quit when i w- i found out i was pregnant i quit as soon as i found out and then 

178.52 190.00 B: i quit the whole time and everything but um my son was in the n._i._c._u. and i was stressed out and then uh for me stress and being around it both those things trigger it so i started back up again 

189.69 192.23 A: yeah yeah well good luck 

190.63 193.05 B: but yeah it's very hard to quit [sigh] 

192.52 194.76 A: good luck trying to quit 

194.09 195.41 B: (( yeah thanks )) 

196.01 198.18 A: (( i know i know it's tough )) 

198.43 202.34 A: hm yeah these ads let's see when i was in um 

203.28 206.86 A: when i was in school one of my professors was uh 

208.06 213.74 A: he was evidently one of the foremost he he this guy was a a marketing professor 

213.44 214.42 B: mhm 

214.18 218.21 A: and evidently the government had consulted with this guy quite a bit 

218.70 223.60 A: about how to approach people with a lot of these anti 

223.54 236.73 A: quit smoking ads and these cam- campaigns like um american cancer society and i don't know different areas of the government and i- it was really interesting to hear him talk about 

225.44 226.37 B: mhm 

236.69 244.92 A: about some of the programs and and the amount of money that the government wants to pour into this 

244.98 251.40 A: also companies wanna pour money into this as well companies who provides to their employees because 

252.23 258.15 A: i [mn] he was telling us about these studies that they've done that actually show how much we 

258.42 262.08 A: we uh h- how you know how much it damages our health 

261.68 262.54 B: right 

262.17 269.03 A: and then of course you know somebody's gotta fund the healthcare to support the the ramifications of that 

268.43 269.37 B: yeah 

269.33 281.80 A: and it was really interesting he he cited some of the studies and and that's why companies and the government are willing to pour so much money into these campaigns to try and help people you know quit 

280.09 280.99 B: yeah 

282.14 294.68 B: yeah that's interesting i've never i didn't really think about that before about how much they put into it um i mean i agree i definitely agree that it it's damaging to the health and it does um 

287.41 288.92 A: oh yeah 

294.80 295.75 B: (( you know )) 

295.65 296.62 A: uh-huh 

296.23 298.76 B: put extra money in healthcare and things like that 

298.94 304.39 B: but on the other hand i kind of feel like like i notice i went to california i live in arizona but 

303.72 306.87 A: mhm oh so the anti smoking state california 

305.64 311.19 B: oh god yeah and i have to say i just it felt like i was in a communist state 

310.93 312.87 A: yeah no restaurants right 

312.58 317.95 B: no restaurants but it's hard even to smoke outside if you you have to only go to certain areas and 

317.96 328.12 B: so you know i from the aspect of even though i know i'm gonna quit one day and i'm gonna be a non smoker one day from the aspect of just having the freedom to be able to do something you enjoy 

327.94 329.07 A: (( mhm )) 

328.43 330.83 B: that bothers me so i don't 

329.56 332.42 A: you felt like that was just a little too constricting 

332.52 341.21 B: yeah i think that people should have the freedom to do something that they enjoy you know i don't know it's kinda the there's there's two sides of it 

336.62 338.09 A: mhm mhm 

340.81 343.42 A: yeah it's tough i mean uh i can see 

343.46 348.55 A: you know i can see both sides of it you know there's people in that restaurant that have to breathe your smoke 

348.97 350.07 A: um 

350.98 354.90 A: uh that's a tough one you know it really is i can see both the 

352.92 362.70 B: yeah well i agree they shouldn't have 'em smoking in the same area that's i when they have 'em now here there's what they have is they have like a totally separate room where you smoke 

362.05 363.63 A: (( oh yeah )) 

362.76 367.96 B: it's totally away from everybody and i definitely believe in that yeah yeah 

364.87 367.05 A: and that's cool i yeah 

367.23 369.44 A: yeah i'm same i'm the same way 

369.80 370.64 B: so 

371.17 371.84 A: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

372.42 376.26 A: well what else around smoking can we talk about 

375.96 381.40 B: um well i'll say i don't like the ads that they put on t._v. you know the um 

380.00 383.24 A: really i haven't really noticed lately 

382.60 386.03 B: i do now i i can't remember 

386.18 388.08 B: i don't remember who puts out 

386.75 389.68 A: tell me about 'em or w- what's kind of the 

389.09 397.10 B: one of the ones i know is they they sho people who have smoked for years and then they like got cancer and one of 'em is this woman who has this hole in her throat 

389.91 390.95 A: theme around them 

396.47 399.34 A: oh i've seen that and she's smoking through the hole 

398.90 404.62 B: oh yeah and you know and i'm like okay that that's gonna get attention but oh i hate it 

400.02 402.02 A: yeah that's pretty intense 

404.55 406.30 A: that's pretty intense 

405.70 417.62 B: yeah i think it's too graphic i think it's too intense but i don't like some of those i think that they're just too much it's almost like they they're gonna do scare tactics to get people to quit which it does make you think 

407.53 408.47 A: yeah 

417.68 421.87 B: but then you know i don't know so i just i don't really care for those commercials 

421.78 426.13 A: mhm i i've seen that one i've d- i remembered that one 

425.69 426.64 B: yeah 

426.75 433.88 A: that was phew i walked away just going man that's intense she's smoking through the hole in her throat oh my gosh 

431.37 433.13 B: i know oh 

433.62 437.28 B: it sticks in your head that's for sure [laughter] 

435.21 443.60 A: [laughter] well maybe [laughter] maybe it's effective i don't know geez maybe it does scare people but uh 

442.92 446.81 B: yeah it could i know that i i still think about it sometimes 

445.76 447.86 A: but you don't like it [sigh] 

447.36 452.29 B: no it doesn't make me quit i'm not gonna say it makes me quit it just makes me irritated [laughter] 

452.10 453.85 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

453.59 454.62 B: but 

454.31 461.06 A: w- yeah i kinda feel sorry for some people at my work not very many people um at my work smoke 

460.76 461.65 B: mhm 

461.34 468.10 A: and i you know they go out to outside and they take their smoke breaks and and the smokers all 

468.24 469.43 A: um 

469.99 480.18 A: th- they know each other 'cause they go out there and they you know they h- take their breaks together and they get to know each other and they're friends and stuff and i almost feel like and i almost feel like and i've even asked them before i'm like you know 

480.00 485.46 A: [laughter] do you feel like you're you're kinda the minority you know kinda ostracized 

486.20 494.67 A: are you made to feel that way or do you just kind of feel that way you know you're different y- you're different than a lot of people you go out and you gotta take your smoke break and and uh 

495.05 498.52 A: and some of 'em have said yeah they feel a little bit uncomfortable 

498.16 499.21 B: mhm 

498.72 510.58 A: it's like any time somebody is the minority just naturally you're gonna feel a little bit uncomfortable and again especially at my work because very very few people smoke um 

503.91 504.85 B: yeah 

508.76 509.73 B: yeah 

511.10 512.24 A: i don't know 

512.08 513.97 B: i definitely feel that way 

512.70 515.50 A: if if you ever feel that way sometimes 

514.80 516.86 B: yeah i mean especially 

517.21 530.98 B: you know when we go [sigh] we go somewhere and i know that the area's um 'cause i know like for arizona is really picking up on california the way they're doing things and so it's getting more and more like that and uh i know for me you know when you go out and you're 

525.03 526.15 A: (( mhm )) 

530.97 537.16 B: try to find somewhere to smoke and you j- just to ask people look at you like you're oh yeah you're one of those 

536.91 538.19 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

537.54 549.37 B: and then you know you you know so you go out and smoke and everyone's kinda looking at your like you're a leper or something you know so yeah it kinda feels that way you know you do and and i know when i was working um 

549.74 556.22 B: you know it [mn] there's like that minority of people and everyone kinda looks like oh the smokers over there you know 

555.44 557.53 A: yeah yeah yeah 

556.91 557.74 B: so 

557.79 563.06 A: i'm sure that some of that looking going and then part of it is probably a little bit self conscious you know 

563.19 571.14 A: uh don't you think i mean there i mean there definitely i'm sure is some of that and and and it's probably just um 

567.50 568.39 B: uh-huh 

571.19 574.94 A: compounded in your mind you know what i mean [mn] yeah 

573.07 578.46 B: yeah it i'm sure it is 'cause it it feels like there's such a stigma with smoking 

578.17 579.21 A: yeah 

578.62 585.15 B: and so i think you kinda just feel like oh everybody's looking at you know this person over here ruining their health 

584.90 586.18 A: yeah 

585.59 587.27 B: you know but 

586.28 587.11 A: (( yeah )) 

587.83 592.54 A: well i feel bad when i hear things like that and you tell me [laughter] that makes me feel bad 

592.61 597.12 B: oh no don't feel bad i mean it smoking is not a good thing though 

594.10 595.35 A: well 

596.36 598.58 A: [laughter] i know 

597.14 599.95 B: [laughter] i smoke but i know it's not a good 

599.32 599.95 A: but
