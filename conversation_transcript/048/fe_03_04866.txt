0.45 2.29 B: hi this is neil 

2.05 3.89 A: hi my name is howard 

3.64 4.73 B: hi howard 

4.98 6.26 B: um 

6.34 12.10 B: well interesting topic [laughter] have you ever watched any ah any trial footage on t._v. 

12.66 13.26 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

13.48 17.69 A: i think it goes back to o. j. when i probably watched 

17.77 24.75 A: i was not one of the people who sat around all day and watched it um but i'm sure i ended up watching some of that um 

20.49 21.78 B: right 

25.35 30.62 A: so to and y- then y- you know i've seen clips of of some other ones 

30.66 31.78 B: yeah 

31.15 32.80 A: how 'bout yourself 

32.24 41.66 B: um yeah i remember i was just returning to the country um from abroad when that was going on and it was i i missed the run up to it i saw him you know being chased live on t._v. 

41.10 41.91 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

41.81 46.32 B: ah fr- in spain and came back and was just totally mesmerized by 

46.12 58.04 B: by that kind of coverage and also by the fact that there were so many sort of similar reality based t._v. shows that were cropping up around the same time that i hadn't been aware of when i left 

57.98 67.74 B: and um it seems like it would be hard to i mean never mind o. j. i think that was a really problematic trial just because it was such a high profile case and i 

67.71 78.21 B: i i don't know it i i i think that that massive t._v. coverage just can't do any good for ah for the defendant you know or for for justice 

68.06 68.91 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

78.15 88.34 B: it seems like it um i mean eee unless you have a sequestered jury i suppose when you know and they're not affected by um all the other people in their lives who are watching that coverage 

88.06 91.89 A: sequestered jury's are very very rare it's very um 

92.73 95.16 A: costly to do that um 

95.88 102.70 A: [sigh] yeah it's really up to the court in um and then and then there's some there's some states that that have it 

102.72 111.37 A: like california i know is m- i think you could pretty much televise everything and then there's still some states where it's um [lipsmack] 

111.64 116.54 A: um it isn't done at all i got i haven't um 

113.89 114.80 B: mhm 

117.00 120.77 A: [lipsmack] i haven't thought a lot about it ah 

121.67 126.46 A: i in fact i don't even know what channel court t._v. is do you [laughter] 

124.89 136.55 B: um no no i mean i know that they show old old episodes of homicide you know [laughter] but that's all i know about court t._v. i what do you i mean do you do you have any opinion on on whether it ah 

126.86 128.52 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

128.91 131.41 A: [mn] uh-huh uh-huh 

132.26 133.37 A: uh-huh 

133.57 134.35 A: (( [noise] )) 

136.76 141.55 B: it takes away from the fairness of ah it the justice system mm 

140.01 145.80 A: [noise] well it's really and and actually i'm a n- i'm a non practising lawyer and um 

146.18 155.26 A: it's it's the run up that does all that not the um [lipsmack] ah not the trial itself it's the it's the publicity surrounding trials like 

155.50 159.62 A: and that goes back even before there were cases um 

160.01 160.62 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

160.64 172.76 A: oh i'm i'm dr sam shepherd is one i mean there are cases that even from the the early sixties when there were just three networks and no thought of even televising a trial that um 

172.87 182.79 A: were thought to be biased because of all the publicity surrounding it and that's what affects the the jury pool once the once the jury's selected um [lipsmack] 

183.17 184.77 A: you know they aren't 

184.88 190.37 A: they aren't watching the trial oh they're i mean they're watching it live they aren't watching it on on t._v. um 

190.76 193.02 A: so it would be more the um [lipsmack] 

193.23 199.35 A: the run up and and there are gag orders that that you know a lot of the run up is still happening when the trial is 

199.37 201.57 A: is happening but it's about 

201.86 208.04 A: you know they have pre trial motions or the jury selection and that that really isn't too i mean i i know for 

208.28 211.07 A: o. j. or maybe one of the ah 

211.62 221.70 A: extremely high profile type things you might find that on tv but that would be very rare 'cause normally without any witnesses or without the defendant um 

222.64 227.33 A: ah well the d- the defendant is sometimes present there but it's it's just not gonna be that big a deal 

226.82 228.07 B: (( ah right )) 

227.52 231.60 A: so it's really the m- it's the publicity surrounding the um [lipsmack] 

232.02 239.50 A: the trials that biases a jury more than than televising the ah the actual thing 

238.92 244.49 B: right i just wonder how much of a distraction it is and and what sort of influence having cameras in the courtroom 

244.70 245.84 B: is you know 

245.07 249.87 A: well that that now that's a good question because there's no doubt [laughter] in the in the ah 

249.90 254.45 A: again back to o. j. i mean that made celebrities out of people you know 

254.63 260.22 A: i it a lot of the people even even sort of like low level like you know f- like sort of [noise] 

260.55 270.50 A: what before would've been like minor people [laughter] on the legal team [laughter] ah i mean they all wrote books every one of 'em even not even the lead attorneys but like the ah 

264.62 265.76 B: (( right mhm mhm )) 

270.91 275.53 A: you know the some of these attorneys that were just around for the special 

275.57 279.86 A: issues the d._n._a. attorney or the this attorney ah 

280.28 281.67 A: it ah 

282.25 295.58 A: it's what it really comes down to at least t- it is a lot of people you know maintain that it's it is a that it's a ah a free speech issue the the only benefit for i think there is some educational benefit of of televising trials 

295.80 300.40 A: it's demystified some of it people have learned from some of it but 

300.01 302.31 B: right yeah 

301.37 302.85 A: [noise] um 

303.89 311.92 A: but it sounds like you know there's a lot of these things that we could live with like you know r- the the reality shows i could live without those [laughter] but again you wouldn't wanna really prohibit 'em 

311.32 318.39 B: no not at all it's a it's it's an inter- i i i just it it was funny coming back from a foreign country and 

311.95 313.92 A: [laughter] 

317.75 318.90 A: yeah 

318.30 329.28 B: after a couple of years and i'd been in college before that and hadn't been watching t._v. at all so i was kind of blown away by what the american public was was asking for or being fed or both 

329.22 344.21 B: and um and i n- and i just it oh it i i d- i remember not sort of you know passing judgement on it because it was just it everyone was watching it but it but it kind of blew me away that you know that that it was that pervasive 

329.74 330.62 A: right 

343.79 344.88 A: (( mhm )) 

344.13 358.87 B: that everybody cared that much i mean to me o. j. honestly before he he committed this murder or was accused i didn't know if he was a basketball or a football player i had no idea i didn't care i knew he was a good looking famous black sports ah 

354.37 355.41 A: (( mhm )) 

358.79 372.02 B: personality and i i didn't watch professional sports really so i didn't give a yeah i didn't care you know um and i'm sure i'm one of the few because i think everyone knew that he was a football star and all this you know um so 

359.66 360.71 A: (( mhm )) 

364.05 365.57 A: yeah yeah 

371.49 374.27 A: it became kind of racially tinged too 

374.42 376.20 B: well i think so i 

375.35 380.56 A: it did yeah but eee yeah i didn't i mean i knew who he was but i didn't particularly um 

380.90 385.55 A: i didn't particularly care one way or the other about him i didn't you know you 

386.32 387.37 B: i i 

386.36 388.46 A: know i just didn't [laughter] 

387.55 396.60 B: yeah i i but i think i think it it this trial that particular trial seemed to polarize people's feelings um 

395.73 397.27 A: oh no doubt 

396.55 410.80 B: and it it seems that you know a lotta people feel that justice failed and that you know it was it was a racial a racially motivated outcome that essentially the jury was a bunch of refuse-niks you know or what i don't know what there was some term that came out some 

410.56 413.85 A: well you know it'd also been paired with the um 

411.34 412.06 B: (( term )) 

414.34 419.65 A: [lipsmack] i mean it was really right on the heels of that oth- of the rodney king ah thing in ah 

418.18 419.25 B: that's true 

419.90 421.98 A: in l._a. where 

422.08 423.72 A: he had been 

424.50 425.53 A: he was 

426.29 439.55 A: tr- w- h- [sigh] i'm b- he was tried too and and was originally found they they'd tried him in a sort of white s- oh no that's o. j. [laughter] i'm getting them confused a little bit [laughter] but that also had been a very racially polarized ah 

440.11 446.18 A: thing and and i think there had been s- there were there were some issues around his trial too 

446.48 449.41 B: huh i don- i don't remember his trial but i do remember 

447.25 451.22 A: but anyway you were [laughter] probably in spain then or something 

450.83 452.13 B: what's that 

451.56 454.20 A: you were [laughter] probably in spain then or some- no 

452.75 459.12 B: no i i remember i was it was at the end of my ah undergraduate experience ah and and ah 

456.32 457.38 A: okay 

459.09 472.82 B: i remember being really freaked out by it but i mean again it was it was one of these situations where it was unclear i mean the cops seemed to have overstepped their bounds but here's a guy you know who jumps out of a car and like keeps trying to get up only he's being beaten you know 

472.60 479.81 B: which i mean i- if you're from l._a. which i am i you're terrified of the cops no matter who you are no matter what color you are i mean there's 

479.14 490.07 A: the other the other person i've done two of these calls is this your first second or third or second yeah my this is my second too and the other person i was talking to from was from l._a. i'm in ah i'm in washington d._c. 

482.97 484.26 B: second yeah 

487.53 488.37 B: mhm 

489.48 490.39 B: uh-huh 

490.82 492.03 A: but ah 

493.11 497.32 A: yeah i'm d- and now i'm getting oh that's an example of something i mean 

497.45 500.23 A: you know it never would've been heard about if there hadn't been a video 

500.26 502.67 A: and just just like this thing ah 

500.26 501.40 B: exactly 

503.30 508.16 A: did you watch any of the stuff about this thing th- that these high school girls in in chicago 

508.35 514.23 B: just you know what i haven't seen any i've seen sort of the teasers you know for the for the newscasts 

508.38 509.46 A: (( who ah )) 

513.20 524.16 A: well that that's another example even you know i'm not all hipped up about it but if [laughter] there hadn't been any video about that nobody would've ever [laughter] you know it just wouldn't have been attracted any attention 

523.64 525.57 B: yeah it's amazing that people 

525.58 527.64 B: see fit to to film it i mean 

528.16 535.47 A: yeah i think they were probably filming it just to watch it for themselves and ah then it ended up you know being such a big thing 

534.83 540.19 B: well yeah a kid came home and said you know guess who's mother made me eat shit today you know and [laughter] 

538.86 544.46 A: [laughter] yeah yeah 

540.56 543.30 B: i mean that's that's pretty mind blowing you know 

543.40 549.44 B: but i mean you know all these all these people who who video tape their crimes i mean they get what's coming to 'em i m- you know 

548.85 553.38 A: there was yeah there was another case about that a it was just plain old ah 

553.73 557.34 A: hoods who were video taping their crimes and of course it ended up ah 

557.37 560.16 A: (( i guess that's kinda the quest for celebrity )) 

560.63 561.77 A: you know 

560.71 564.16 B: i i guess or just to it over later you know 

563.74 565.98 A: yeah yeah yeah 

565.07 568.58 B: but ah but as as for the question of of 

567.89 574.32 A: if i ever did a crime [laughter] i would not video tape it i guarantee you [laughter] [laughter] but [laughter] 

570.84 573.09 B: oh my god i know i mean that 

573.18 578.16 B: hopefully you have a good enough memory to remember where you were so you can lie about it later you know 

577.26 578.99 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

578.29 582.34 B: but ah no i i i as for the coverage in the courtroom i 

583.35 597.99 B: i you know i i don't i don't have an opinion i just i just know that i was in ah on a jury for some silly personal injury ah trial and having cameras would've been a distraction i can tell you that but it would've been a welcome distraction 'cause it was so boring 

591.34 592.37 A: (( mhm )) 

594.92 596.10 A: you'd notice 

597.73 599.89 A: you know they never that that is one th-
