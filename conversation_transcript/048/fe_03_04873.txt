1.77 4.76 A: [sigh] hello my name is kevin krukoff um 

5.11 9.71 A: well they have they have court trials on on t._v. i believe that uh they should have uh 

9.97 11.24 A: you know i 

11.67 13.64 A: mean nothing should be 

13.93 14.83 A: um 

16.06 19.17 A: um withheld that's that's pertinent 

17.91 18.99 B: (( [noise] )) 

19.23 21.79 A: um there's privacy act though but 

23.02 24.53 A: ah that's my feelings 

23.24 23.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

26.02 26.93 B: okay 

27.27 28.19 A: thank you 

28.50 29.06 B: (( [noise] )) 

30.53 38.58 B: okay well my name is nicole and i believe that um they should be televised so the public knows um what's going on in the country 

38.60 39.68 B: um 

40.13 42.49 B: basically we know what we 

42.53 43.54 B: um 

43.90 51.80 B: are up against or are looking forward to by these trials because we know what's going on in the media and so on and so forth 

51.91 56.47 B: and i think that if we're all aware of what is going on on a regular basis then um 

56.78 58.72 B: we can all know what to expect 

59.82 62.08 A: (( [sigh] hey there's nothing wrong with being informed )) 

61.34 62.15 B: (( [noise] )) 

62.20 63.95 A: (( they've got informed juries )) 

62.23 63.97 B: i'm sorry [noise] 

65.92 66.96 B: i'm sorry 

66.74 69.77 A: [laughter] there's nothing wrong with being informed they have informed juries 

66.97 67.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

70.62 77.20 B: no there's nothing wrong with that either but i think that it helps us you know especially with the o. j. simpson case 

77.43 79.92 B: um and winona ryder 

79.97 85.89 B: we can kinda know you know who is on the media what they're doing our actors you know they're 

86.07 88.04 B: criminals themselves 

88.43 92.20 B: and i don't think that we would have known details without it being televised 

92.59 94.65 A: yeah yeah that's good to know that 

93.86 95.61 B: [noise] mhm 

95.82 99.05 A: 'specially has to do with the national se- security of the united states [sigh]

105.29 106.75 A: exactly 

105.43 106.27 B: um 

106.40 109.11 B: which obviously that isn't happening 

109.42 113.34 B: but i think that it's more important for the public to know what's going on 

116.76 124.66 B: so [noise] i haven't seen any other trials besides the o. j. and winona ryder as far as celebrities 

117.51 118.40 A: yeah

157.02 163.62 A: sort of contempt for not showing up for court you know and stuff and get i mean they start making up excuses not you know

168.84 171.34 B: (( right [noise] it's true )) 

171.68 186.66 B: [cough] and you know people that have um like if they were given one life sentence or two life sentences most of the time they don't even serve a complete life sentence you know they get off easier because of you know good behaviour 

187.51 190.82 B: so this helps keep us informed also 

191.08 194.98 B: as to what our government you know is deciding on 

194.90 208.30 A: exactly with the laws that the house of the senate has made is not didn't invent very good laws because they let people you know they give ah sentences to people with forgeries i noticed that today you know and other people they they let off the hook you know

243.48 244.98 B: (( okay [noise] right [noise] )) 

244.44 257.24 A: i as a victim they didn't let me know about a crime they didn't let me know about the court proceedings or give my side of the story and that that's totally against my rights and that still hasn't been addressed in the courts and i can't get any attorney to

536.40 539.47 B: i mean that's pretty much all you saw on t._v. 

539.53 543.00 B: i mean everybody was just so focused on that case 

543.22 545.49 B: and i just don't think that it's 

545.67 550.48 B: they're making a big deal about it as much as they were for you know o. j.
