0.82 1.92 A: hello 

1.72 2.85 B: hello 

3.41 6.84 A: um so we're supposed to talk about these criminal trials 

7.95 9.55 A: um what do you think 

9.92 12.19 B: um i guess yeah 

12.94 20.64 A: um the one i really remember is the o._j. trial and i think that was like too much 'cause it was on like every channel you remember 

20.56 22.31 B: mhm 

22.73 29.58 B: well i mean they shouldn't be like on every channel but i guess if some people want to see it it should be available 

29.51 37.22 A: right well i don't mind if it's like you know there for people who want it but don't like give it to everybody that you know 

37.79 40.45 A: not everybody maybe wants to see it you know 

39.81 41.47 B: yeah 

46.38 49.28 B: well i guess you'd have it on one channel or something 

48.93 61.79 A: right i mean like if it's on a court t._v. or c. stand or something like that but i think the media tends to really blow these news events out you know just to make it a big thing for ratings you know what i mean 

61.45 63.20 B: mhm 

63.19 66.95 A: like they'll do anything to get you to watch their channel 

86.36 89.19 A: so do you have anything else to say or 

90.20 91.62 B: not really i mean 

91.82 92.70 A: mm 

97.55 100.36 B: i pretty much agree with you know what you're saying 

99.95 101.04 A: what's that 

100.72 103.46 B: i said i pretty much agree with what you're saying 

103.39 104.36 A: um 

107.15 113.41 A: i kinda wonder too if it can affect the judgement of the people involved if it's on t._v. you know 

114.07 119.15 A: like are they gonna do things just because they know they're gonna be seen on t._v. 

120.27 129.04 A: not so much will people get into trouble for that reason but like are their lawyers gonna present things like more plain to the audience at home you know 

123.71 124.42 B: (( mm )) 

128.77 130.18 B: yeah 

129.79 139.83 A: 'cause also some people are like what they call convicted by the media before they're even convicted by a court 'cause they basically lead you to believe that somebody is so bad 

137.10 138.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

141.84 143.49 B: [noise] 

168.07 171.14 A: have you heard much about this um peterson case 

172.40 174.89 B: um not really 

174.26 179.88 A: you know that's the one with the pregnant woman and supposedly her husband has killed her or whatever 

181.60 183.91 B: i think so i might of heard some stuff 

184.68 185.48 A: huh 

185.35 190.88 B: i said i might have heard some stuff uh like if it's on i don't really don't really watch that much 

188.53 189.46 A: oh 

189.47 190.66 A: well 

191.45 198.46 A: some people really don- i mean i can't take watching the news all the time any more who wants to hear about all the terrorism and stuff 

198.17 205.86 B: yeah really like that's why i don't i mean i'd rather watch you know like something funny than watch like about people getting killed and stuff like that 

203.08 209.89 A: right 'cause t._v. should be an escape right they shouldn't be dragging you back into reality [laughter] 

206.79 207.75 B: mhm 

217.28 220.47 A: not only that i think it's just kinda negative too 

220.22 221.14 B: mhm 

220.49 227.62 A: and also like if somebody's gonna blow you up i think they're gonna blow you up and there's not much you can do you know [laughter] 

226.98 228.84 B: yeah [laughter] 

227.70 233.99 A: so i figure you just have to live life and not worry yourself over it 'cause worrying doesn't really help anyone does it 

243.29 247.42 A: have you ever got anyone else to call you for this thing 

247.03 248.71 B: no this is the first time 

248.54 258.96 A: oh i've got a few calls but i never really liked the topic before so i always told them to just hang on and call me with something else but this one i thought would be okay 

260.00 261.61 B: what's this for um 

262.10 265.21 A: um it's supposed to be a um 

266.61 274.08 A: something about they need to be able to analyze how people have different conversations and something like that 

274.24 279.80 A: it it's the linguistics department at some university or something 

280.92 290.90 A: all i really know is i read about it on one of these um bulletin boards i go to online and they said that they were paying like ten bucks a call or something 

288.50 294.48 B: yeah oh all right yeah yeah i just recently signed up for that [cough] 

294.40 297.09 A: so i figured well what the heck 

296.85 298.30 B: yeah might as well do it 

299.62 308.91 A: i'm just not sure some of the topics there's a whole lot to talk about though 'cause like this one if we pretty much agree you know what is there to debate on [laughter] 

309.26 311.75 B: what kind of topics have the other ones been for 

311.75 315.96 A: um they have a list of topics let me see if i can find it on here 

316.93 317.49 B: (( [cough] )) 

317.92 322.86 A: i bookmarked it when i signed up 'cause i didn't know if i would need to go back to it you know 

323.52 325.43 A: but i gotta find the bookmark 

334.47 336.10 A: uh let's see 

339.38 340.78 A: um 

340.96 345.85 A: one that i thought was really interesting is they have one where 

346.15 348.63 A: if somebody you didn't know 

348.63 363.08 A: offered you and your best friend each one million bucks but with the stipulation would be that you could never speak to your best friend again would you take it and like do you think they'd take it i thought that one was interesting 

363.64 369.88 A: i really wonder why anybody would make that offer but it would be interesting if they did 

369.09 370.79 B: (( mhm [mn] yes )) 

370.12 382.02 A: and i've had some people that the minute i told them that were like instantly they knew right away that they would take it and i would have to think about it 'cause it would really depend what friend they were talking about 

381.22 383.41 B: and that's what i'm thinking about right now [cough] 

383.75 395.60 A: 'cause there's certain friends that may be they would think that was my best friend but i don't think that they are or you know what i mean but there's some people that i really would want to talk to more than i'd want the money 

390.05 391.25 B: yeah 

396.55 399.19 B: the topic the topic's kinda strange though 'cause i mean 

399.59 400.51 B: you know 

401.00 404.30 A: yeah i think all the topics are a little kind of offbeat 

407.67 411.06 A: (( um even like )) 

411.19 415.29 A: another they says um if each of you 

415.71 425.98 A: oh i see if each of the people in the conversation you know that get called on and so on if each of you could go back in time and change something you'd done what would you change in life 

420.44 421.41 B: mhm 

430.95 443.71 A: and i'm really not sure that i'd wanna do that because i i kinda feel like that yeah i've made mistakes but probably i've learned from them and if i haven't made them i would still need to make them you know 

440.15 441.01 B: mhm 

443.56 446.42 B: (( yeah [mn] mhm )) 

444.87 447.82 A: like i think that as time goes on 

447.91 453.10 A: these things that happen to you that's what makes you who you are and you wouldn't be the same person you know 

457.69 459.16 A: then uh 

459.88 462.48 A: they've got one about the minimum wage 

463.16 468.22 A: uh asking if you think the minimum wage of like five fifteen an hour is enough 

470.01 472.02 A: i really don't know 'cause 

472.14 484.82 A: i've not really had a chance to get out and work much but when i have i was able to negotiate a lot better rate than that i think it should be left up more to people that negotiate with where they're going to work 

485.15 490.47 A: you know what i mean i think it's better that it's like something that you can come to your own conclusion 

491.00 495.20 A: 'cause why should the government just be saying well you have to be paid this much 

494.80 496.46 B: yeah 

496.03 508.07 A: to a certain point i agree it's good but 'cause there are other countries where they don't really have a minimum wage and supposedly it works out pretty well 'cause people just negotiate it as part of like when they're taking a job 

509.00 515.62 A: i think it's just anything else like whether you want benefits or what kind of benefits you get and stuff 

517.06 520.23 B: have you ever completed one of these calls before 

520.35 527.36 A: um no this is the first one i've successfully done 'cause the one i tried to do one a while ago 

527.39 536.08 A: and like i kept saying hello and stuff and hi and i like it was like no one got connected to me or something 

536.15 541.97 A: and it came on and it said that the two of you are connected and you know now we're gonna record it and stuff 

542.05 548.86 A: and it gave the topic but i couldn't find anybody to talk to [laughter] so i ended up hanging up [laughter] 

550.72 554.74 B: mhm [mn] so do will they just like contact you by email do you think 

554.38 555.21 A: huh 

555.26 558.77 B: will they just like after the ten minutes 

559.03 560.09 B: is over 

559.28 563.70 A: oh after ten minutes i think it's supposed to come on and tell us that it's done 

564.25 565.95 A: the computer or whatever 

566.39 569.04 A: i think it's supposed to like come back online 

572.65 577.05 A: but i think we've only actually been talking about like 

577.40 580.48 A: it actually hasn't been that long from what i can tell 

581.67 590.08 A: maybe like well it's not been ten minutes yet i'm sure of that i didn't really look at the clock when they called and so i can't tell 

588.70 591.87 B: me neither i just rushed to answer the phone 

592.69 594.56 A: what's that 

593.70 596.54 B: i just like ran to answer the phone and 

595.91 599.89 A: oh [laughter] well see where i sit most of the time it
