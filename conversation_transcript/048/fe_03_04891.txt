1.93 3.41 A: hi i'm dean from new york 

3.67 5.44 B: hi to you how ya doing dean 

5.00 7.80 A: good is that washington d. c. or state of 

7.20 9.00 B: that's state of 

8.07 9.89 A: state of wow okay 

9.16 12.63 B: [noise] yeah so west coast east coast here 

11.80 14.72 A: that's sort of curious a big difference in location 

13.67 15.06 B: yeah 

16.13 20.07 B: so ah televised criminal trials [noise] huh 

19.70 20.60 A: mhm 

21.18 23.44 B: (( ah i [noise] i ah i )) 

24.01 25.42 B: dunno about that one 

26.01 31.35 B: i think ah i think in some respects it could it could ah um 

31.83 38.35 B: prejudice ah you know peop- well i guess if a jury's already been selected it's not a little different 

36.50 37.47 A: (( right )) 

39.44 40.60 B: (( but um )) 

40.04 40.81 A: true 

40.89 43.43 A: mhm and did you watch like the o. j. one 

43.79 46.04 B: you know i did actually 

44.72 51.88 A: [laughter] most people did [laughter] i think you're in the vast at some point 

47.70 49.22 B: [laughter] so 

51.60 59.93 B: yeah yeah i it it was i mean at some points it was kinda [noise] kinda boring but you know in other ways it was pretty riveting 

56.15 57.92 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

59.18 61.83 A: (( right mhm exactly )) 

60.28 61.29 B: um 

61.91 70.89 B: yeah i think i you know high profile cases we're all kinda [noise] a little bit morbid i think so we all kinda wanna ah 

70.26 73.14 A: (( yeah )) 

71.17 72.25 B: (( i dunno )) 

72.52 77.95 B: look into the other side so to speak and that kinda gives us the ability to do that 

78.14 80.60 B: by televising you know 

79.69 88.21 A: mhm if you don't televise you just gonna get the ah news reports which could be slanted in one way or the other you you don't get a chance to make your own opinion 

84.01 85.63 B: yeah 

87.99 90.17 B: [noise] true true 

89.23 98.53 A: but on the other hand if someone's found not guilty or in- not right not guilty not necessarily innocent but not guilty little difference in terminology like o. j. 

98.29 100.13 B: right 

99.05 101.78 A: you know it does put the whole country kinda 

102.50 110.37 A: against them you know in reality if you look at the real legal system he was found not guilty 

103.58 105.59 B: yeah yeah 

110.13 112.10 B: right right right 

110.92 111.98 A: and yet 

112.18 115.44 A: almost everybody thinks he's guilty [laughter] 

114.21 115.54 B: [laughter] 

115.73 122.18 B: who who watched the trial yeah yeah same with the the menendez brothers 

117.62 120.38 A: mhm yeah i mean he may be 

121.17 123.85 A: mhm right 

122.74 124.84 B: (( and that trial that you know )) 

125.13 131.94 A: right i mean it's a matter of you may not be able to legally prove it but that doesn't that's the difference between that and public opinion 

131.74 133.90 B: right right 

133.36 141.55 A: i mean there is certainly enough evidence for the public to believe he was guilty maybe not you know we do have that extra standard in the legal issue 

140.30 141.12 B: (( sheesh )) 

141.52 149.85 A: oh it's a tough i mean and the other thing that also bothers me is that sometimes you wind up with every station carrying the same thing where you don't really get a choice not to watch it 

149.63 155.83 B: yeah that's true y- ah b- have you ever watched court t._v. yep 

154.78 157.46 A: um a little bit yeah 

156.03 158.22 B: yeah um 

158.26 165.82 B: some of some of that is boring i think i think the the um the high profile cases are are 

166.11 173.93 B: what would peak public interest but the rest of the stuff and i guess that's what we're the subject matter is is something that's high profile 

174.00 183.98 B: but you know i i i i probably would say yeah to to televise 'em i think ah it would well gee i dunno 

180.85 191.99 A: right i mean i think of and i'll just play devil's advocate i think if you're accused of a crime that you really were not guilty of like you were accused of murdering some actress 

191.99 193.77 B: yeah 

192.69 202.97 A: would you want to be televised and what happens to if you found not guilty would you really want everyone to associate you with her crime i mean that's just like devil's advocate but i 

194.72 196.13 B: yeah no 

200.37 201.70 B: yeah 

202.08 203.64 B: yeah 

203.13 211.31 A: mean that that's a real unlikely possibility although you're closer to california than i am [laughter] 

208.44 211.21 B: [laughter] 

211.63 213.33 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

212.42 215.72 A: but i mean everyone brought to trial is not guilty [laughter] i 

215.70 217.16 B: right 

217.09 222.56 A: mean that's the i mean i kinda like the idea of being able to form my own opinion because quite frankly i don't trust the 

217.44 218.39 B: yeah 

222.91 225.96 B: yeah i don't either i don't either 

223.50 235.00 A: press i don't know if you've ever been on a jury but i was been on a couple of juries and one criminal and some of these people who are on the jury are rather bizarre 

234.91 236.63 B: yeah 

235.60 238.50 A: and i i'll give you an example there was a ah 

239.10 243.74 A: someone hit there were two cars that collided it was a criminal case 

243.10 243.95 B: uh-huh 

243.80 251.13 A: and there was four counts against the guy i guess and i'm sorry not and this was a stolen car 

251.07 262.86 A: it was a stolen car and some guy was found in a stolen car by j._f._k. airport and one of the things he said is he was a bartender so one of the counts against him was drugs uppers some kind of amphetamines he said 

251.10 252.00 B: okay 

255.06 256.06 B: (( okay hm )) 

262.63 274.71 A: they were my drugs i was a bartender and needed to stay awake at night he denied the other three charges and we get into a room and i think i was actually the one that said okay well we can get rid of the one on the drugs he admitted that were his 

274.49 286.72 A: someone actually said oh i'm not s- i don't think they're his i think he just said he was guilty of that so we would be easier on him on the other three counts but what has that have to do with the tea in china 

283.25 285.82 B: (( [laughter] )) 

287.07 288.88 B: oh no 

287.72 299.77 A: you know [laughter] so you that's i mean i i'm again it's a new york city jury i dunno if it's standard throughout the country but you know i sat there scratching my head and it's like you wonder about these people on these 

296.18 297.51 B: yeah see 

299.98 304.28 A: juries because most people i dunno that it's the same in washington but everyone here in new york 

304.35 308.01 A: (( no one ever wants to be on the jury it's amazing to me )) 

307.45 318.36 B: um i i wouldn't i wouldn't say that everyone um there's there's a a vast majority of people who who don't th- and and the circle of people that i associate with 

318.23 323.34 B: but i [noise] i work in the criminal justice field i i work inside a county jail 

322.77 324.13 A: (( oh okay )) 

323.92 326.09 B: so myself 

324.63 326.54 A: a little different slant oh 

326.39 337.69 B: yeah myself ah i almost exclusively get thrown out of juries because no no defence attorney wants me sitting 

333.95 337.17 A: (( right mhm mhm )) 

337.77 343.16 B: for any kinda any case criminal civil they just don't want me there 

341.28 342.05 A: (( mhm right )) 

343.51 350.53 B: so i have i unfortunately haven't had had the opportunity to sit a jury but um 

351.56 360.69 B: you know even a- i i i'm i dunno if i'd i'd want them i certainly wouldn't want it televised [noise] if i was the one sitting in the hot seat 

353.42 356.04 A: (( mhm )) 

360.15 361.21 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

360.97 370.35 B: but i on the other hand as as a a spectator so to speak it is nice to be able to watch 

370.44 373.64 B: things transpire and and form your own opinion 

371.92 373.64 A: it's 

374.03 375.52 B: so i 

375.34 376.41 A: a tough one 

376.70 379.05 A: it's easier to call when it's not you 

376.74 377.86 B: yeah 

378.90 382.27 B: right exactly exactly 

380.04 387.52 A: [laughter] it's like it unless y- some of my colleagues at work who are very staunch republicans and i tend to more liberal 

387.39 393.70 A: and it's amazing how the abortion issue is no way and i turned to one of 'em once and said 

393.56 404.15 A: you got a fourteen year old daughter i hope she gets pregnant thanks i bet you change your mind and yet they'd he'd ah would if she did i guarantee you he would if someone wants their fourteen year old daughter to have a baby 

398.41 399.38 B: (( mm )) 

401.27 402.48 B: right 

403.81 404.95 B: right 

404.21 416.62 A: and ninety nine out of a hundred staunch republican conservatives will all of a sudden change their mind when it c- concerns them directly uh-huh it's amazing it sounds great on paper until 

412.28 414.36 B: personally yeah yeah 

416.42 425.50 A: would you want your fourteen year old daughter to have a baby yet they don't want to have abortion either and i dunno the answer but i guarantee you every one of them their answer isn't so clear 

418.70 419.85 B: right 

421.40 422.67 B: right 

425.28 428.07 B: right oh yeah oh yeah 

426.85 431.42 A: mhm or twelve or girls kids today have sex awfully young 

431.61 432.82 B: yeah when 

431.82 443.72 A: so i mean that's the yeah i mean i guess i would if you know looking at it it's it's probably better off having it 'cause like the public can make their own opinions and get a feel for what's going on 

444.03 445.02 B: yeah 

444.47 449.86 A: but it is like if it is tough i just think about you know that if you really were innocent 

450.64 457.54 B: would you want it out there yeah i think i i don't i don't know that i would that i would vote a law 

452.36 454.10 A: yeah 

457.61 461.78 B: to say that they will all be televised i don't think i would do that 

461.79 466.51 B: to be to let it still be discretionary i think is is 

464.95 474.93 A: uh-huh but whose discretion that's the problem [laughter] sounds good on paper i don't disagree with you but does everyone have to to vote the 

467.06 468.39 B: well 

470.37 471.56 B: yeah 

475.39 480.99 A: well i guess the only discretion would tend to be either the judge or the defendant i guess 

481.03 482.15 B: (( i )) 

481.16 484.01 A: i mean the d. a. should have no vote it's none of their business 

483.68 489.33 B: yeah n- normally it's the judge who says whether or not the cameras can come in his courtroom 

485.87 487.54 A: right 

488.73 493.11 A: [mn] but should the defendant have that option i mean it's 

490.73 493.80 B: yeah well yeah 

493.25 499.07 A: their life more than anybody else in that court i said i can't imagine the d. a. has any say in it i mean who cares 

499.05 500.26 B: right 

499.07 513.13 A: what do they outside of getting press to be able to write a book or something [laughter] really and the judge is obviously trying to do what's best overall maybe it should be the defendant's choice i mean it's their life why shouldn't they have that choice i dunno 

503.18 504.86 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

507.94 508.90 B: right 

512.56 514.48 B: yeah yeah 

513.70 514.83 A: i mean i 

514.98 525.62 A: it's hard to say 'cause you gotta think most of these high profile criminals really are guilty [laughter] i mean i don't i must say is i certainly don't believe a hundred percent but i would personally over fifty 

519.84 520.86 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

525.06 531.76 B: yeah yeah well in the ones that i've seen no no question i mean ah 

530.55 531.46 A: uh-huh 

533.20 540.42 B: what was it robert blake of course i don't know i'm not so certain whether he was or not i mean there were some 

534.68 535.83 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

541.07 544.81 B: i dunno if you if you saw any parts of that one either 

543.52 547.20 A: (( i didn't see any parts of that one no i mean i kinda heard about it )) 

547.45 548.98 B: [noise] 

549.31 550.67 B: (( so i i )) 

549.42 554.03 A: (( but )) 

551.27 552.20 B: (( dunno )) 

552.62 553.51 B: (( i dunno )) 

553.96 557.53 B: they certainly have been coming up with some [noise] odd questions [noise] 

556.96 564.29 A: uh-huh i guess they just wanted to simulate one of the questions i had was really boring 

557.90 558.84 B: oh 

563.70 566.07 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

565.15 569.32 A: what was i can't remember it was so bad i mean we finished in about three minutes 

569.18 571.05 B: [laughter] 

570.25 575.11 A: but this was this one definitely you can talk about for a while because there's not an easy answer 

574.85 577.25 B: no uh-huh 

576.02 584.04 A: kinda the other thing is we sensationalize you know murder rape and high profile and all this other stuff i'm not so sure it's good for kids 

584.02 593.39 B: oh [noise] i i my personal opinion would be no i i wouldn't i wouldn't let my children watch ah a murder trial let's say or you know a 

593.52 599.68 B: any- anything that's come along in in recent years i wouldn't i wouldn't let them sit and watch 

598.61 599.89 A: what about the the the
