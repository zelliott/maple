180.20 181.45 B: (( i dunno )) 

182.44 193.33 B: [lipsmack] i mean it's like it's very you know when you think about it how people used to have executions and the whole all the people would come there and watch them and it would be really like exciting for the people 'cause they had blood lust [mn] 

183.50 184.20 A: (( i )) 

193.80 202.32 A: dunno about that totally different whatever they didn't have like they didn't give like somebody like judicial process or whatever to fucking like convict somebody

202.15 203.51 B: yeah 

202.68 216.07 A: and there will be i mean that's like that's like totally like on that's totally on like the s- like the government sat or whatever and acted like a bully had a court case and don't let anybody in public know anything about it or whatever and like just like fuck over this person like like really really bad 

204.57 205.90 B: maybe you should have the 

211.54 212.60 B: yeah 

214.54 216.58 B: so maybe the defendant should have the oppo- 

216.63 217.77 B: the option 

217.60 218.68 A: (( huh yeah )) 

218.12 220.25 B: maybe the defendant should have the option 

220.96 222.68 A: (( yeah i guess so i dunno )) 

222.48 224.22 B: that seems fairest 

223.35 230.36 A: like you would totally have like civil disobedience cases and anything like politically motivated or like morally motivated you know what i mean like 

225.13 227.16 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

229.77 231.09 B: yeah 

231.11 232.08 A: (( [noise] like )) 

231.26 233.08 B: yeah that way you could just [noise] 

233.87 237.51 B: because some people would be ashamed like my sister would hate it have hated that 

236.86 238.33 A: [noise] why [noise] 

238.44 240.91 B: if if her court case had been on tv

247.58 254.46 A: well you shouldn't be driving drunk [laughter] [laughter] i mean if you did something fucked up then obviously or whatever like it's going to go against you or whatever but 

253.20 257.44 B: [laughter] what if you didn't like what if she didn't but they were trying to charge her with that you know 

254.59 255.34 A: (( 'cause )) 

257.21 261.49 A: well then i guess they would use show it in court that she didn't probably i dunno 

261.02 265.73 B: i don't i mean i think people are wrongly convicted and i think that the t._v. would [laughter] 

264.40 278.38 A: i mean if you're wrong but i'm saying like if you were like [noise] if you were wrongly convicted the- then you would like then i dunno the judge can't like deny you motion to like present evidence or something like that that will like that will like you know go in your favor or whatever 

277.97 278.88 B: mhm 

278.55 280.23 A: (( [noise] um ))

301.94 304.46 A: (( [noise] court case i anyway )) 

305.34 311.91 B: [noise] so um yeah so i dunno we i never i think [mn] that it's important that we have um like 

312.16 319.26 B: when public people are tried that their cases are shown [noise] like monica lewinsky and stuff 

319.27 326.89 A: yeah i mean what if you if you were drunk driving then like yeah yeah like uh o. j. simpson you kill somebody whatever like 

319.91 321.47 B: and iran and contra 

323.47 325.14 B: what you should be hung but 

326.86 334.39 A: having it in public or something like that where you're going to get like a fair trial and you're not going to fucking like win out on about being like having shit loads of money or something like that or like 

333.85 336.91 B: o. j. simpson did win out on it 

334.16 344.22 A: but your sister like will actually like if your sister's actually drunk driving or something like that or whatever and like she got away with it it probably only because she was like blonde white and shit and like you know what i mean like 

342.41 346.39 B: mhm [sigh] but o. j. simpson did get away with it [sigh] [sigh] [noise] 

345.73 353.15 A: he did but i'm saying like like it's like there's all this evidence stacked against him and shit like that and all and he had like shit loads of money and like 

354.37 356.48 A: get away with it whatever [noise] 

355.44 358.08 B: right [noise] but it being on t._v. didn't [mn] 

357.76 368.58 A: yeah yeah but if it was like obviously if it was in the public eye it had to be like the most like by the book like just trial ever whatever and he probably didn't [noise] would've fucking been found guilty or whatever 

368.03 370.09 B: but it it was in the public eye 

370.42 371.97 A: the whole trial 

371.41 372.53 B: yeah 

372.22 373.28 A: (( i dunno )) 

374.18 376.45 B: people were watching it every day on t._v. 

374.33 374.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

376.10 378.12 A: [mn] the whole trial was on television 

377.53 378.64 B: yeah 

378.87 380.31 A: (( [mn] i dunno i )) 

379.06 381.46 B: it was on like every day on every channel 

381.73 382.65 A: dunno 

383.20 388.67 A: (( but i'm just saying like in cases like like like in i dunno like i dunno )) 

383.86 385.26 B: i think it was 

388.02 391.65 B: everyone was watching it they all just wanted him to get off because he was a football hero 

392.91 394.92 A: and he was black too whatever so 

394.72 396.44 B: i don't think that really helped him 

397.45 398.40 A: (( [noise] i dunno )) 

399.68 404.35 B: a black guy killed a white woman and he gets off i mean that's kinda weird 

402.61 404.21 A: (( yeah it is true i guess )) 

404.41 406.04 B: that's not normal at all 

407.29 409.26 B: i don't think he got off because he was black 

407.31 416.84 A: but i mean like in like in a case like or something like that or whatever like there's no way in hell like the cops would have got acquitted after that shit happened or whatever and of the ev- evidence and stuff like that or 

416.53 418.07 B: if it had been on t._v. 

417.51 432.32 A: yeah or like mimea like that had like this it was like so much evidence like proving that he didn't fucking kill that cop or whatever like a person actually comes out and says that he killed the cop himself or whatever and like they still won't allow him like [noise] even if like he did st- 

423.72 424.57 B: mhm 

432.48 437.51 A: still get did get convicted or whatever like you there 

435.28 437.14 B: or it could be overturned easier 

437.83 442.35 A: like you wouldn't be de- denying so much shit like judges do to these people or whatever 

441.85 444.83 B: mhm 'cause it's all behind closed doors 

443.77 454.93 A: yeah yeah they're like constantly like [noise] like in like in a or whatever like almost like all her peers were like even though like a lot of people when they were like interviewing 'em and stuff like that or whatever like [noise] 

456.35 465.90 A: like when they're interviewing 'em and they ask them if they're right like they're basically like really blind about them being racist and stuff like that or whatever and the judge still allowed them to be like you know part of the jury and stuff like that or whatever 

464.83 465.80 B: mhm 

466.34 471.29 A: you know and they're like all white and like i dunno shit like that wouldn't have happened 

470.70 471.50 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

471.74 473.83 A: (( but i dunno )) 

475.35 476.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

479.15 481.03 B: i dunno what it says here [noise] 

479.53 482.75 A: [mn] [noise] oh lord a long ten minutes 

481.72 483.29 B: [sigh] i know 

483.31 484.23 B: [laughter] 

483.46 484.43 A: um 

485.13 488.97 B: well yeah so it's nice to meet you what 

485.31 486.30 A: (( yo- so )) 

486.52 490.57 A: we shouldn't be watching television anyway i dunno [laughter] 

489.79 491.94 B: we shouldn't be watching television anyway 

491.37 492.38 A: (( i dunno )) 

492.16 494.60 B: there's been no television watching [noise] 

494.62 497.54 B: in this house since buffy ended on tuesday night [sigh] 

494.89 496.03 A: (( [noise] but )) 

496.40 501.61 A: [mn] another scary thing about that too is like people just aren't educated about like certain issues and like [noise] 

501.83 509.37 A: don't know anything about the judicial process you know to even like really be making decisions on about this and that you know what i mean like 

508.70 513.34 B: yeah because they don't haven't seen everything and they would have to see it more if it was all on t._v. 

509.52 510.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

510.66 511.68 A: (( huh )) 

512.84 514.36 A: (( yeah yeah and plus )) 

514.98 521.46 A: you know obviously well even if i dunno even if you're watching the court or whatever like i dunno 

522.56 523.61 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

522.65 527.36 A: i dunno whatever everybody ended up being the jury themselves and [mn] 

528.61 529.55 A: (( i dunno argh )) 

530.82 532.23 B: wow 

531.92 532.83 A: yo 

534.71 535.70 A: so 

534.91 536.23 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

536.48 538.76 B: [laughter] yeah um i 

537.80 538.74 A: (( yo [noise] )) 

539.36 552.58 B: guess but i think that t._v. would only put on like certain cases like you know it's i mean i guess you could say the same thing about cops like it [mn] it's good if they show p- the police in action but it's so fucked up the way they show them and it also like contributes to people like 

552.61 554.67 B: you know like that show cops 

555.49 558.92 B: i feel like the court [mn] like t._v. show would just be like cops 

559.24 571.71 A: right only show like a certain angle and cut out this and that or something like that or whatever like it's not actually own- it's not the station is actually being run by like [noise] like grass roots fucking like people and stuff like that or whatever it's still gonna be fucked up yeah yeah 

562.00 563.72 B: yeah and it also like cu- 

570.35 576.21 B: yeah i mean it would be it would be cops right except for in the [noise] they would just show like a bunch of crack heads like 

576.44 577.74 B: you know in court 

577.59 579.05 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

579.24 583.63 B: and it would be like those and those people do not deserve to be exploited like that again you know 

584.17 586.41 B: like on cops it is so disgusting 

584.22 585.07 A: mhm 

586.40 592.85 A: (( [noise] and i guess they'd probably be able to like pick and choose on what cases they show on television because there are so many fricking cases like going on and stuff like )) 

592.35 596.15 B: that's all they would pick is for people's like prurient interests [noise] you know 

595.80 596.92 A: yo 

596.59 598.98 B: to find so people could kinda like
