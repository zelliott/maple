25.36 26.95 A: i love it 

26.76 28.21 B: (( you love it uh )) 

27.75 41.78 A: yeah yeah i think it's um i think it's something that i think anybody that gets themselves into trouble and has to be in front of a a judge ah everyone deserves the right to see him i guess 

41.66 43.03 B: yeah that will be 

43.68 46.47 B: [mn] i mean it be difficult to pick which one 

46.30 48.13 A: yeah exactly 

47.44 57.68 B: because the o. j. trial monopolized most of the um the time when it was on i can't see how they'd be running two at the same time 

52.35 54.53 A: oh absolutely 

57.05 60.32 A: hm right yeah that would be a little difficult [laughter] 

58.49 59.91 B: (( [noise] and what )) 

60.85 62.66 B: and then there's um 

62.89 70.29 B: well it's already uh public as far as the immediate area goes i don't see any reason ah why they should broadcast it 

70.53 72.78 B: it makes for too much um 

73.72 78.16 B: [noise] ah they'd be playing to the audience i think like they did in the o. j. trial 

78.20 80.94 A: you know what you're right you're absolutely right 

80.42 84.34 B: they'd be just playing to the audience to my because that's what how he seemed to do 

84.72 89.64 A: it is like they play up certain things and and it may not be a fair trial 

87.99 92.42 B: [noise] yeah and you'd be getting in the makeup and ah everything else [noise] 

92.22 93.54 A: yeah 

93.58 95.36 A: it is kinda strange 

95.10 98.31 B: [noise] dress for the trial and ah [noise] 

98.86 104.33 B: i dunno i don't think it's ah well i i just put it this way i don't think it's necessary you can do it 

99.19 101.81 A: [mn] yeah get sponsorship and 

105.20 106.27 A: right 

105.40 110.47 B: [noise] but i don't think it's really necessary i don't i don't see what it would ah add to the um 

110.78 114.17 B: [noise] respect for the judicial system or anything of that nature [noise] [noise] 

114.68 118.00 A: i completely agree i i think that um 

118.29 120.56 A: it it's there and and there's 

120.68 126.33 A: no i don't even really watch court t._v. all that much and i think is that pretty much the only 

126.71 133.65 A: broadcast network that does that type of thing where they just broadcast um trials all day 

132.27 137.73 B: oh you mean the ah the judges that come on and handle the uh small claims courts 

137.68 139.16 A: (( yeah the )) 

137.95 139.94 B: that's the only thing that's on now 

140.35 141.54 A: oh is that what it is 

140.46 143.61 B: [noise] they they go over pretty good there's about a half a dozen of 

143.97 153.90 A: yeah wow okay okay i didn't i didn't realise there was that many but with the with the o. j. trial was that on was that on court t._v. or what was that on do you remember 

152.07 157.21 B: 'em [noise] [noise] ah it was on while it was happening 

157.43 159.94 A: it but it was it was um 

159.91 169.56 B: [mn] it was in its entirety they were going through everything [noise] they weren't p- pulling any shortcuts and it was ah tedious in some um 

159.98 161.21 A: what network 

163.77 165.06 A: wow 

169.84 172.98 B: in some instances where it just got boring as hell 

173.10 175.66 A: yeah oh it sure did 

175.17 183.68 B: and ah whereas you wanted to get it over with and uh [sigh] they made such an ass out of the ah los angeles police department 

183.62 185.26 A: such an ass 

184.69 190.47 B: everything they were doing seemed to be incorrect as as far as the defence counsel was saying anyway 

190.97 192.03 A: yeah 

190.97 193.30 B: and apparently the jury um 

193.42 196.40 B: the jury backed them up they acquitted him 

196.46 200.35 A: yeah exactly i mean they um 

200.52 203.00 A: they were a hundred percent by him that's for sure 

203.35 205.03 A: i think it's um 

205.43 209.89 A: you know i i think that the more high profile the person 

210.17 222.35 A: and the more that they get themselves caught up into bad situations and they get themselves into court it's going to be tough not to get the cameras involved and have people out there that wanna watch just because i 

222.39 223.87 A: (( mean people go out and buy )) 

222.61 225.22 B: [mn] [noise] sensationalism yeah 

224.37 237.58 A: exactly people buy people magazine and absolutely i mean people people yearn for that type of stuff when they when they see a celebrity in the public's eye they they wanna they wanna be there 

225.57 227.54 B: that's what you're going to get um 

235.67 239.41 B: [noise] yeah that's it's in the newspaper that's enough 

238.97 246.56 A: yeah in the newspaper would be fine absolutely but it's it's tough to um it would be tough to regulate that because 

240.67 242.61 B: yeah 

246.51 257.96 A: everybody wants to go out and get some video cameras and and film it and show it live and [sigh] tap into it which is which is kinda bad because i think that 

251.79 253.79 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

257.28 259.72 B: [noise] makes a public circus 

259.58 260.59 A: yeah 

260.64 264.81 B: [mn] [noise] like that's where the o. j. trial went anyway i thought 

260.71 261.97 A: yeah absolutely 

264.84 274.58 A: yeah people were benefiting largely from that advertisers and and people that were watching i mean everyone was benefiting from it that's that's what's really weird 

274.61 283.37 A: it's like he's he's up there on trial and everybody is paying for advertising to get their commercials in when it goes to break and 

283.20 295.19 A: i dunno it just it seems ah it seems a little awkward to me but i mean i'm i'm all for it i i i think that being able to turn it on and watch it is it's kinda hysterical but i mean it's 

295.15 304.02 A: i i think i'm kinda coming along the same lines as you are in the sense that it's not needed definitely it's not needed but you know what are we going to able to do about it they're not going to be able 

302.75 307.28 B: [noise] well i dunno i don't think anything constructive came out of the o. j. trial 

307.42 308.59 A: (( to no )) 

308.44 316.22 B: [noise] i don't see what good that did ah to publicize that like it it was it was almost like publicizing a farce the way i was 

316.35 317.81 A: (( er publicizing )) 

316.47 319.26 B: conc- almost made it farcical 

318.31 320.15 A: yeah 

320.26 327.49 B: and i don't think that did any good to ah people watching it [noise] i have respect for the judicial system and police work 

320.30 321.49 A: yeah that 

328.56 329.65 A: yeah 

328.97 331.76 B: i mean it sorta made a mockery out of most of it 

332.24 334.06 A: yeah absolutely 

333.46 334.91 B: the way i saw it [noise] 

335.34 339.34 A: definitely and did you did you watch quite a bit of it or or just kinda check in 

338.22 346.05 B: yeah i'm retired i was watching um i watched quite a bit of it [noise] i got tired of it it was interfering with other ah 

342.97 343.83 A: yeah 

347.15 352.55 B: other [mn] um you know much of it is b- to watch a trial much of it is ah 

352.72 355.26 B: repetition and ah 

355.30 362.14 B: you know procedures that ah have very little interest there to the public 

360.23 361.20 A: yeah 

361.81 372.40 A: yeah most of the stuff i mean i was i was young when when that happened and uh i would just kinda check in and i guess get the highlights i guess you could say of the trial and 

370.33 371.56 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

372.24 375.40 B: yeah that's the only way to do it it's no use to sit through it all 

375.14 377.12 A: no i mean it's so boring 

375.72 378.43 B: so you pick up the highlights in the newspaper 

378.11 380.57 A: yeah yeah exactly 

379.37 383.30 B: [noise] that's what they touch on the highlights right and go through the whole procedure 

383.89 389.24 B: they ask so many repetitive questions and ridiculous questions over and over again 

389.12 390.08 A: yeah 

390.72 392.98 B: [mn] i don't see where it ah and 

393.99 401.88 B: then the particularly well o. j. simpson was on trial so ah that made it more of a public oriented but ah 

401.98 405.66 B: you get an average person on trial for a crime and um 

406.12 409.24 B: there'd be no sensationalism there just um 

408.26 409.43 A: not at all 

409.63 411.37 B: having to sit through um 

411.81 425.37 B: a procedure i don't i don't see what ah appeal it would have to people ah it would have people appeal to some people but the average person i don't think would be too interested just in the en- just in the results uh would be more um 

416.14 417.08 A: (( i don't either )) 

420.67 423.52 A: no [laughter] probably not 

425.30 429.93 B: of interest to the public like they do in the newspaper they give you the results 

429.70 430.72 A: yeah 

430.82 435.48 A: yeah and that's and that's what's that's what's good is just being able to get a whole ah 

435.43 446.21 A: just getting the highlights and you can read it at your leisure and be able to do what you want to do and it's not getting spoon fed to you and it's ah it's it's it's good it's definitely good 

439.42 441.31 B: yeah 

446.76 451.48 B: [mn] i can remember some parts of it that were just boring and just repetitive 

446.93 448.25 A: (( i er )) 

452.31 454.34 A: oh of the o. j. case [laughter] 

453.66 462.10 B: [noise] yeah the same thing over and over again when you know how legal procedures are you have to do everything just right 

454.68 456.32 A: (( yeah )) 

459.07 460.28 A: you know what was 

461.53 462.82 A: yep 

462.89 467.65 B: when a a a newspaper reporter eliminates most of that he just puts the highlights in 

467.47 469.65 A: yeah and gets to the facts of the matter 

469.14 470.65 B: yeah 

470.68 474.99 A: which is good who was that what was the lady's name that the 

475.33 477.76 A: the de- defence attorney or
