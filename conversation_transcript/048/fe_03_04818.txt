23.55 27.26 A: yeah i think it must must be in l._a. i think [noise] 

27.30 34.29 B: yeah or maybe they just match people up from the same areas or something but this is i think it's something like university of penn like uh 

34.36 35.37 B: pennsylvania 

34.49 37.31 A: oh yeah huh 

35.87 37.60 B: (( [noise] but )) 

37.61 40.55 B: uh how how many of these have you done before 

40.93 45.28 A: this is my third one actually i'm glad it's like it's my last one 

45.27 46.34 B: oh wow cool 

45.68 49.35 A: this what did you talk about in your last one what was the topic 

49.09 52.66 B: it was actually this same topic it was this smoking topic 

52.31 53.75 A: oh really 

53.38 55.72 B: (( so have you talk- had other topics )) 

54.28 63.33 A: my first one was my first one was minimum wage then my second one was video games [laughter] now i got smoking [laughter] [noise] 

60.35 61.34 B: oh wow 

61.98 75.53 B: oh i guess it's just a random thing i don't even think they care that much about the uh the topic i i think they probably just throw the topic out there so that people have something to talk about uh the- and they want to hear people be opinionated but um 

71.06 72.11 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

75.58 79.69 B: but uh yeah so what do you think about uh smoking ban 

80.57 85.51 A: i'm all for it i don't know why somebody would- wouldn't be you know for it 

84.67 87.32 B: yeah um 

85.78 86.98 A: i mean 

87.25 92.32 A: you're just basically smoking a pack of cancer that's it you know so i don't see why 

90.77 92.01 B: yeah 

92.21 103.88 A: i mean to each their own though so like i'm all for people you know if they wanna smoke they can smoke but just as long as the fumes aren't around me i'm you know that's just my opinion 

101.91 102.84 B: yeah 

103.73 112.09 B: that's how that's how i feel too and actually i mean my my opinion is um i go to vegas a lot and 

111.24 112.14 A: uh-huh 

113.01 116.93 B: when i go there it's like i realize when you go into a restaurant 

117.07 130.05 B: people are smoking and it's like i think we've got kinda spoiled here in l._a. 'cause it's like you can actually go into a restaurant and enjoy your meal with breathing smoke but now you you go someplace else and it's like damn 

129.50 134.41 A: oh yeah like i'm from san diego and in san diego they have like uh 

134.69 141.79 A: uh like these indian reservations and on the indian reservations you can smoke you know like casinos 

139.91 141.07 B: oh wow 

141.50 142.64 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

141.78 149.86 A: and literally when i get home i smell my clothes and my clothes just reek of smoke 

149.65 150.70 B: yeah 

150.60 159.42 A: and they like and you take it for granted you know that you know that y- you don't have to deal with that every day 

159.33 168.27 B: yeah yeah totally um but i think that l._a. is like one of the only places that they actually have the total smoking ban they just did it in new york 

168.36 170.08 B: or um i guess maybe 

168.89 170.91 A: san diego they do i 

170.86 173.18 B: maybe it's all of california i've seen 

171.07 172.23 A: know that 

172.25 174.57 A: yeah it's california i'm pretty sure 

173.52 184.43 B: oh it's the whole state yeah um well i personally like the idea of being healthy and not dying so i'm glad there's a smoking ban [laughter] 

175.05 176.83 A: yeah 

184.77 188.93 A: yeah i a- i am too but at the same time it's like 

188.94 193.85 A: i don't think they should make it like illegal to smoke or anything but 

192.96 199.05 B: no uh but i just sort of feel like it's like if a person wants to smoke they should be allowed to but 

193.86 194.82 A: (( you know )) 

199.32 207.50 B: but it's their job to keep the smoke away from me you know it it's like if they want to smoke in their houses i i don't i'm not for making 

202.87 204.08 A: (( totally )) 

207.61 221.93 B: smoking illegal at all um i just sort of feel like if a you know i i feel like a person who doesn't smoke should be allowed to go should be able to go wherever they wanna go and that's public and not 

210.83 214.58 A: (( mhm )) 

221.97 226.71 B: not breathe smoke um so that's sort of how i feel about it 

223.93 225.77 A: exactly 

226.87 240.00 B: and also the thing is you know they they when they first did the smoking ban they thought it was going to hurt restaurants and bars but it hasn't i mean restaurant and bars do you know probably better business than they would 

239.82 247.57 A: well 'cause what i mean all they do now is they just have like at least in clubs they have like little patios 

240.12 241.17 B: without the ban 

247.56 248.39 B: yeah 

247.94 254.37 A: and stuff where people can smoke outdoors and nobody seems to mind that you know 

253.77 255.15 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

255.39 261.86 B: so um how first of all are are you from san diego like you you've been in california your whole life 

261.12 264.11 A: yeah i've only been up here for like four months you know 

264.13 265.35 B: oh really 

265.19 268.08 A: yeah i've lived in san diego my whole life 

267.90 276.88 B: oh wow yeah i well i'm from back east i've been out here for a while actually the guy i talked to this morning just moved to l._a. maybe there's a bunch that just moved to l._a. 

274.50 275.64 A: oh yeah 

275.65 286.30 A: is l._a.'s just the transplant city pretty much everybody comes here for the same reason too [laughter] be their acting or to be behind the camera

324.78 325.88 B: (( i don't know that one )) 

324.99 325.93 A: so 

326.54 327.92 A: have you heard of that one 

327.84 329.43 B: i no i don't know that one 

329.56 334.46 A: yeah it's a new one coming out it's like it's like the have you heard of the bachelor 

332.29 332.85 B: (( [mn] )) 

334.33 335.12 B: (( yeah yeah ooh )) 

335.62 344.55 A: it's like the bachelor but it like all the girls the the winner gets a million dollars but the catch is 

344.57 350.56 A: they only get the million dollars if they never see the guy again and the guy 

350.45 360.63 A: who's the bat- like the joe millionaire guy or whatever he's he doesn't know any of this he doesn't know that all the women are all actually competing for money

360.88 362.34 A: and so 

362.87 370.04 A: the interesting twist is that some of the ladies actually like the guy and then it's gonna you know 

370.37 375.85 A: th- you know it'll be hard for them to choose between money or him and then other ladies 

376.14 381.01 A: are strictly just you know they don't care about the guy but they want the money 

380.85 382.36 B: (( oh wow that [noise] ))

413.47 428.27 B: yeah well four month you know the first four months can be you you know can be kinda hard 'cause it's it's a hard city to like get around in it's hard until you get to know people in but i mean it sounds like you kinda hit the ground running 'cause you've been here for four work uh for four months and you're already working on some shows

502.94 517.12 B: three calls today i got one call this morning and i talked to the guy and then i got another call later in the day i was busy so i didn't answer it and then i just got this one so yeah i guess i guess they want they to knock it knock your three calls out pretty fast um which is 

516.91 519.70 B: which is cool 'cause you get the money faster [laughter] i 

519.14 522.85 A: [noise] well and it's pretty good money for a research you know 

522.50 524.16 B: (( yeah yeah you know ))

560.39 564.42 A: yeah i i think it's like linguistics study or something 

563.27 576.65 B: linguistics yeah so i you know i i i guess you know they kinda want ya to talk about the smoking thing but i think they probably don't care that much about that they just wanna make sure that you keep talking 

566.32 566.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

576.85 583.33 A: well i think it's also how like people interact when you're like introduced to a stranger 

577.09 578.12 B: through the whole 

583.35 585.42 B: that's true yeah i guess 

583.96 589.06 A: basically like how people it's not the topic it's how people 

589.09 595.52 A: are like cordial and how people are like i'm sure that's probably what it is 

592.20 593.20 B: yeah 

593.41 599.89 B: and probably you know they introduce and also th- the topic like this topic of the smoking is kind of i mean
