0.60 1.91 A: jason 

1.91 3.48 B: hi i'm marissa 

4.97 6.27 B: so what do you think 

6.61 13.08 A: um okay what's the question should they be ah [laughter] televised um 

8.74 10.02 B: [laughter] 

10.66 13.69 B: [laughter] yeah should they be televised 

13.56 22.72 A: i think that yes they should i don't personally watch them but i feel that i should have the right to watch them 

21.77 28.83 B: i would agree i think that i mean if something was if the case is going on about me i probably wouldn't want anyone to see it 

28.47 30.19 A: (( right )) 

28.79 37.10 B: but i think in today's society as much as we want to say that it shouldn't be i think free speech and if you wanna watch it you should be able to see it you know 

36.41 38.09 A: right 

37.06 41.10 B: but i think maybe it's you should also think of the privacy 

41.04 52.47 B: of the you know persons involved and maybe you shouldn't air some things that might you know jeopardize their you know security or something like that 

44.12 45.79 A: right 

52.54 61.86 A: right it's funny i w- i wonder where like how do you draw that line between [laughter] what's okay to televise and what's not okay to televise 

62.18 63.89 B: yeah i would agree 

62.41 63.37 A: you know 

64.22 78.79 B: but i think i mean ah it it's hard to like draw up like a d- a you know line it's it really is but i think i think the the party the defense well not the defense the pros- the whoever's prosecuting should have a bigger say than the defense 

70.29 71.96 A: right 

73.75 74.64 A: uh-huh 

76.54 78.21 A: (( right )) 

79.17 80.43 A: right i agree 

81.01 81.92 B: you know 

81.98 82.98 A: yeah 

82.30 84.53 B: have you watched any trials on t._v. 

84.36 88.61 A: um i haven't i let's see i watched some of o. j. 

88.79 90.92 A: [lipsmack] because i think we all did 

90.97 97.81 A: ah i don't know if someone i watched when jenny jones when she had the guy on who was 

98.00 103.31 A: who ah had a gay guy had a crush on him and then the guy ended up killing himself and then they 

101.04 102.53 B: yeah 

103.32 107.15 A: you know i watched that a little bit just 'cause it was really like out there 

107.88 109.53 A: [mn] what about you 

109.31 121.25 B: i haven't really seen any i really i didn't even really watch the o. j. trial all i watched was the verdict like i can remember i was i was in like high school or something and everyone like piled into the library to to 

114.58 115.60 A: uh-huh 

118.19 119.14 A: right 

120.25 125.21 A: right i think i was i think that i have a similar story i do remember that 

123.38 124.40 B: (( you know )) 

124.65 132.42 B: so it was interesting i mean it was interesting just to see everyone around around me l guess reaction rather than even what mine was 

132.09 133.15 A: right 

132.54 133.56 B: um 

133.71 143.82 B: but i mean i ha- i never watch these things but i love like law and order like i love you know court t i love court t._v. shows i think they're awesome like anything that has to do with 

138.24 140.54 A: right i love law and order too 

143.65 157.24 B: any of that stuff is so interesting to me but the actuality like you know they had the law and order that like was real and they did you see that one there was like there was like a law and order like they tried to make it work like a series where they it was an actual case 

151.06 152.18 A: which one 

156.93 157.90 A: uh-huh 

157.26 165.34 B: a- and i i don't know it it just didn't do it for me once it was like for real it just i don't know they couldn't put it together as well as it was 

164.27 166.72 A: right whenever they make it up 

165.97 172.06 B: right [laughter] the made up one is more interesting though a lot of those cases are based on real cases 

171.33 180.04 A: yeah the law and order s._v._u. the special victims unit the one about like sexual victims that one they base on 

177.78 178.95 B: mhm 

180.40 182.01 A: [lipsmack] real cases 

182.45 183.69 A: and then they 

183.80 197.36 A: you know build off of that pretty scary it's really scary like it it would be scary to watch that on t._v. ah you know a rapist and w- i don't know 

186.24 187.99 B: [noise] it's scary stuff 

197.81 199.07 A: it's scary 

198.66 207.40 B: no it definitely is like the one they had like the real law and order and it was just it was very disturbing to me that you know like this person was sitting there and and this girl had to you know 

207.66 218.71 B: like discuss what had happened to her and how she was followed and you know they're they're second guessing her and they're second guessing a girl that got raped and she wasn't lying and that's just so uncomfortable you know 

218.15 221.24 A: (( right it's pretty frightening )) 

220.44 223.45 B: and and it's like real emotions become involved so [lipsmack] 

224.67 225.76 B: i don't know 

224.87 228.46 A: oh [sigh] me either we have to keep talking 

225.79 227.13 B: [laughter] 

227.88 234.17 B: i know [laughter] what are you doing for memorial day i don't think we have to talk about the topic right 

228.77 230.65 A: [laughter] 

231.62 239.96 A: i'm not doing anything oh i don't know i was actually on as an extra i did a l- an episode of law and order s._v._u. 

239.33 240.79 B: you did 

240.58 242.30 A: i did it was pretty fun 

241.92 244.36 B: that is so cool 

244.06 244.78 A: (( oh )) 

244.82 246.36 B: that is so cool 

245.06 248.85 A: i and like i was a um czechoslovakian 

249.01 251.72 B: really which ep- was it has it aired yet 

249.89 250.80 A: yes 

251.61 254.98 A: yeah it aired in january it was a while ago 

255.09 258.15 B: i watch a lot of them i probably saw you [laughter] 

258.23 262.29 A: well i don't know it was a fleeting glance it is a good show 

258.72 260.14 B: it's a good show 

262.49 264.49 A: i'm you know i don't know 

264.87 267.20 A: i think i'd rather watch law and order than 

267.98 269.23 B: (( than s._v._u. )) 

268.18 269.73 A: than the trial 

269.80 277.45 B: i like cr- i don't like criminal intent as much criminal intent is my least favorite the one where you like see the guy do it in the beginning you know who did who did it 

269.95 271.73 A: yeah 

273.88 274.55 A: (( mm )) 

276.36 278.26 A: right 

277.47 285.13 B: like the whole point of law and order is to not know until the last like until it's like you know fifty seven or fifty eight like on the clock right 

283.24 285.06 A: right [laughter] 

285.68 288.15 B: and then you like figure it out and you're so psyched 

285.80 287.00 A: that's true 

289.33 291.79 A: oh lordy so what 

290.61 293.51 B: have you done this before this is my first phone call 

291.98 294.55 A: no i've never d- this is my fir- this is my first one too 

294.31 295.48 B: [laughter] 

295.37 298.52 A: oh i wonder if we'll talk to each other again maybe not i don't know 

298.77 304.17 A: ah what was i going to say what who has committed a crime recently that might be televised 

303.90 312.31 B: um i have no idea like i don't follow like any of that crap i mean if they put like osama bin laden on trial they'd probably televise that 

312.11 315.48 A: right oh so frightening 

313.24 317.43 B: right i would i would like to see that i'd that would probably be one i would wanna see 

317.55 319.38 A: right 

318.35 321.28 B: you know or if they catch saddam hussein 

321.59 325.49 A: yeah you know that there's gonna be media coverage of it 

321.96 322.97 B: i won- 

324.38 329.34 B: i wonder if they would like execute those people on t._v. if they were gonna execute them 

327.52 329.66 A: oh yeah 

329.69 330.68 B: you know 

331.00 333.99 B: i feel like they would be handled very differently than anyone else 

333.69 335.73 A: i agree 

334.92 335.83 B: right 

336.43 339.73 A: indeed twenty four hours a day media coverage 

336.61 337.76 B: but i guess 

339.30 343.80 B: mhm well there's those there're others like there are those like court t._v. channels 

343.76 345.48 A: right 

344.54 345.74 B: you know 

345.84 349.41 B: but i don't know how much viewing i don't know how much people watch them 

349.94 351.49 B: i have no idea 

351.17 352.58 A: (( yeah i don't either )) 

352.94 356.51 B: [laughter] i wonder how long we've been talking i have no idea 

355.52 360.85 A: i don't know we should've timed it so that we'd know to carry it to the end 

358.44 360.22 B: i know right 

361.15 365.15 A: i don't know what else to talk about i'm not exactly educated on it

373.20 374.75 A: [laughter] 

379.55 381.14 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

380.79 388.10 B: like i feel if i got a topic that i was really passionate about i would be like really pissed off at the person and like wanna hang up but i couldn't hang up because it's like ten minutes 

387.77 392.33 A: right because we have to talk forever and ten minutes is apparently much longer than i thought [laughter] 

391.49 398.01 B: i know right it doesn't seem like that long and i feel like we're both like talkative people it's not like
