9.81 12.11 B: where are you where are you located 

12.29 15.02 A: i am located in south bend indiana 

15.15 17.99 B: oh okay i'm in new york the big apple 

17.26 17.95 A: o- 

18.03 20.14 A: okay all right 

19.52 22.51 B: [laughter] okay so where do we go from here 

22.82 25.30 A: (( ah i don't know i ah )) 

25.93 27.85 A: i thought i was doing a survey 

28.21 34.51 B: yeah um they want us to they were saying something about discussing um how do we feel about um 

35.13 39.67 B: the topic of something that has to do about criminals being televised 

38.35 42.22 A: crim- criminals yeah being televised you know 

41.33 42.10 B: oh 

42.25 43.32 A: um 

44.13 50.09 A: i guess we you know i don't know how how long we're supposed to do this for or whatnot or 

49.12 50.57 B: ten minutes mm 

50.29 55.26 A: about ten minutes that's right um basically my ba- my view on this is 

51.77 52.73 B: mhm 

55.65 56.69 A: uh 

56.95 59.26 A: we have a very very 

59.34 61.22 A: televised world 

61.26 64.81 A: uh you know everything everything that we do everything 

64.95 72.43 A: anything from basic just comedy you know our lives our bloopers in our lives all the way to the murders um 

72.73 77.84 A: they're they're highly televised so you know just like 

77.91 87.23 A: uh the most recent one wha- what was that lady that was caught with her with her and her baby in the river with uh is under investigation right now 

87.50 89.18 A: um you know it's it's 

89.34 95.13 A: i guess my basic point is is that it's very hard for somebody to get a fair trial 

95.27 105.70 A: if everybody has their opinion already before you know before they can i don't know because the 'cause the television has been doing basically 

105.74 110.07 A: all the spots and everything like that so it's hard for him to 

110.40 115.43 A: although i may think he's guilty that's only because i've only seen what 

115.84 117.09 A: the 

117.19 119.98 A: how should i say it what the news has been putting out 

119.68 121.23 B: exactly 

120.89 123.77 A: so i guess i guess my feeling is is 

124.13 127.64 A: no i don't really like the idea of uh 

127.74 131.92 A: you know i mean it's good that they keep us abreast on stuff but i mean 

132.54 140.85 A: it it's it's difficult to say i mean for nosy people that uh have nothing to do well i guess yeah i guess it it's a good thing but 

140.29 140.87 B: (( ho- )) 

141.45 142.43 A: go ahead 

141.54 142.22 B: i 

142.34 156.39 B: i think that everybody has a right to privacy to some degree even criminals i mean because you are innocent until proven guilty so why should you be exploited and like you say everybody has their opinion there is another interesting thing i caught the middle of this morning 

156.25 166.39 B: this girl i don't know what state it was in but did you see the one with the girl she had like green hair and um she got suspended she's a teenager she's suing 

166.71 167.90 B: because she wants 

166.93 168.15 A: i have 

167.80 171.15 B: she wants it off her record i don't know what state that's in 

171.01 183.52 B: she has green hair and they was saying that it's a freedom of speech and no one said anything about her green hair you see how like you said everybody voices their opinion they were saying the the judge or the i guess the district attorney he was saying 

183.43 197.32 B: oh well did you the guy behind her was saying fuck this and fuck that excuse my language and i'm saying it to you the way he was saying it and he was like well they didn't say anything to him and this girl the teenager she had a shirt on 

189.19 190.58 A: (( that's all right )) 

197.30 199.71 B: she was against war and terrorism 

199.48 203.07 B: and so she had a sh- graffiti shirt that she made herself and 

202.85 211.86 B: i don't know there was on- one particular symbol on it that she had i never seen this symbol before it wasn't like one of the nazi signs i don't know what this new symbol stands for 

211.69 218.73 B: but anyway because of that and her having a shirt with all the graffiti written all over it and green hair they suspended her 

219.11 232.70 B: she wants it off her record so they have this publicized all over the um t._v. about about this situation if you watch the news um you'll probably catch it again it it was interesting but then it was like 

232.88 245.65 B: god i mean do- does anyone have any privacy any more you know i said this to myself this morning you know because she's young she's a teenager and i thought they had rules about that exploiting people that was a certain age don't they 

245.79 255.94 A: right i as i said my feeling is basically this there are some things that t._v. can be used for to do basic things you know i guess that 

246.10 246.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

256.29 259.43 A: i don't know that may actually do better 

259.72 268.65 A: in that kind of situation you've got a young teenager like you were saying that doesn't have the ability and if without television 

268.45 275.58 A: no one would know about it and she would be expelled from school or suspended and you know and and so i guess 

275.64 278.55 A: in some aspects t._v. is good because now 

278.90 282.38 A: you know that to me is uh is a 

282.61 288.39 A: is a breakdown in freedom of speech and and and freedom of expression so 

288.75 297.89 A: without television nobody else would know about it and i don't think that girl would have a fighting chance but at the same time just like you know uh 

297.95 302.47 A: going back to the murder trials and and having them televised um 

302.85 308.32 A: in one way it's good it's good to have the to know what's kind of going around in the world 

308.45 319.69 A: uh and that's the as is an informative society we like information we like to know what's going on but at the same time to do twenty four hours a day coverage to do 

315.14 315.90 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

319.56 325.75 A: uh seven day a week coverage on this uh murders and so forth it's kinda hard for 

325.88 327.20 A: people 

327.83 335.40 A: to get a fair trial because by the time it hits the court and they they get to see everything it's 

335.22 345.89 A: to the point where you know oh because of the news this guy's already guilty before ah you know the whole thing innocent before proven guilty goes right out the door because 

346.49 354.64 A: the news basically deals with the information that they they're given from the police and then they from there 

354.77 357.01 A: derive their own conclusions 

356.91 358.02 B: that's true 

357.11 357.83 A: and 

358.24 361.16 A: and because of that the problem is is 

361.04 370.25 A: that's just one man's opinion of a or one person's opinion excuse me about about what's going on and of course when one news broadcaster 

370.09 380.22 A: delivers it they all kinda follow the same track and then ex- exploits that one angle and they don't give the they never give the 

380.76 391.35 A: they they try but it always they try to give a non- non biased opinion but it never works because when you're giving a news story they have to give 

391.55 400.83 A: what they feel because th- that's how how news stories are given and unfortunately if if that news station or that person 

401.00 401.94 A: has a 

402.10 407.39 A: ha- doesn't ha- has a negative feeling towards it they're gone i mean it's it's done it's 

407.44 417.07 A: it it uh you know just like they are saying they don't know if this man can get a fair trial at home because of that uh 

416.17 426.11 B: yeah and what about people that will start calling in vo- voicing their opinions can you imagine that one you know like say if they make a statement like today right i mean 

426.37 427.85 B: i wanted to say 

427.75 436.60 B: i wanted to call in so bad and say would you stop focusing on this girl's green hair because the color of her hair has nothing to do if what she's 

436.45 445.30 B: you know about her record she wants this off her record she feels that it's not fair that everybody was cursing at you know cursing in the classroom they were not disciplined 

445.67 459.12 B: like she was disciplined for having the shirt on and you know and that and they were arguing the thing about you know um freedom of speech you have the right to say what you want but ju- just thinking about in um school system 

459.56 467.55 B: okay in the school system you're not supposed to even have that type of conduct in a school atmosphere cursing and carrying on 

467.32 479.45 B: so the people behind them as well but then they turned around and said well she started the whole commotion because if she hadn't of wore the shirt they wouldn't have got aggravated okay and i don't think that was fair 

479.40 481.89 B: and i mean it was so annoying i was going oh 

481.69 496.16 B: and i can just imagine the people that was in the court room itself to have to actually sit there and then you know in the future you know th- they may have to even say guilty or not guilty and you know they're gonna probably be sitting there for hours because somebody gonna have a attitude like me and there's some people who say look 

495.97 499.76 B: all the kids are crazy all the kids are wild they got green hair they're cursing 

500.42 505.76 B: suspend them all and forget about it i want to go home then you might get someone who want to diligently 

505.65 508.98 B: do some research and say well listen how did the whole thing start 

508.75 519.63 B: was she trying to promote was she protesting she got arrested did she do this did she do that you know it's like so much and then it's got to go into another sector because it's gotta go away from the green hair and a classroom 

519.46 524.73 B: and to what the whole issue was about the terrorism and war you see what i mean it's gonna go in one 

524.77 528.90 B: one episode into another it's gonna be long and drawn out 

527.23 531.16 A: right i i i totally agree on that um 

529.53 530.56 B: [laughter] 

530.68 532.10 B: [laughter] 

531.21 536.65 A: yeah i just my my my basic feel on this is that you know 

537.27 540.90 A: i think that people watch too much television as is 

540.60 541.73 B: thank you 

540.99 544.05 A: and at the same time i i highly 

544.10 547.66 A: believe that if it wasn't for 

548.74 549.81 A: um 

550.20 559.26 A: if it wasn't for television i think there will be some different different uh how should i say it outcomes on some of the trials that we see 

558.85 560.00 B: mhm 

559.50 563.25 A: i say that because i feel because of television 

563.29 569.40 A: i think there are there has been a times where a judge has been persuaded 

569.46 576.93 A: because of of the stress level and the and and the media level that has been that's being done with 

576.95 577.85 A: some of these 

578.79 580.64 A: oh can you give me one second 

580.58 581.72 B: mhm 

581.42 582.33 A: (( yeah hello ))
