21.89 24.46 B: i don't think it was it did any good 

23.95 25.70 A: no i don't think so either 

25.38 33.62 B: they made a circus out of it and it was too primed to public opinion and i didn't see any ah reason for it at all

34.20 36.47 B: i don't see what they get by um 

34.27 35.19 A: i don't

39.39 41.15 B: televising um

49.26 55.35 B: no there's no way they've been having trials now for years without it being on i dunno what what they expect ah 

55.69 60.99 B: televising the trial's gonna do for it and they then they always have a change of venue when ah 

61.05 64.14 B: the public in the certain area is too um 

66.18 69.23 B: is too biased or influenced by it 

66.18 67.64 A: informed i guess 

69.08 71.13 A: yeah 

70.55 74.71 B: and this would only do more of it m- make more people aware of it 

74.19 75.84 A: yeah 

76.19 78.69 A: [sigh] i don't think they should be publicized 

80.30 82.88 A: [cough] you ever watched anything other than o. j.

121.03 122.85 A: [noise] have you ever watched any other ones

139.21 140.82 B: (( they come on the news )) 

143.20 148.45 A: i think they're getting too public with ninety percent with everything 

146.28 147.65 B: with everything 

148.11 149.93 B: yeah with the war 

150.46 152.09 A: yeah 

150.69 157.92 B: yeah they they were giving out more information and uh i don't know what do we gotta do be generals that they gotta give out all that information

161.13 162.96 A: yeah 

163.32 165.62 B: turned out all right but um 

166.19 171.13 B: seems to me iraq could have had somebody listening to the t._v. and picked up some information 

171.18 173.91 A: yeah and who don't and who kn- they might have been 

173.70 175.70 B: yeah 

174.63 177.03 A: i think that's why they kept taroldo out 

177.42 178.71 B: yeah

181.78 184.65 B: down to the details like that 

186.00 188.44 A: [sigh] 'specially you know it's like ah 

189.17 193.46 A: look at the life o. j.'s living now becau- you know even though he was found not guilty 

193.98 196.89 A: you know the all the public- publicity 

197.24 200.32 A: that's going to screw a person's life up guilty or innocent 

201.26 207.62 B: yeah i heard there's um he's having trouble with his daughter too those kids are going to grow up and look into it 

206.98 208.14 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

209.13 210.49 B: (( that was ah )) 

210.93 216.18 B: [mn] that was a hell of a one that why was that i dunno why was that put on television and nobody else's 

216.37 217.95 A: [mn] i don't know 

217.58 221.38 B: just for the the publicity factor the way i see it 

220.85 222.99 A: yeah shock value 

221.85 222.49 B: (( wo- )) 

223.14 224.65 B: yeah 

223.99 226.78 A: you know a public figure figures 

227.19 230.20 A: prominent as him and 

229.38 232.23 B: well i can't remember a public figure creat- ah 

232.49 233.67 B: um 

233.80 237.91 B: committing a a crime like that so i guess that's why it was done 

237.71 239.67 A: yeah 

242.20 245.98 B: (( [mn] other other trials are are usually not that ah )) 

246.85 248.67 B: (( ah what would you say [mn] )) 

253.23 256.37 B: so damn um bloody 

255.67 257.88 A: oh yeah 

257.81 259.96 B: he really appealed to the ah 

260.11 261.15 A: well 

261.34 267.74 A: it's i dunno i think that lady that killed her uh three daught- her three kids was worse than you know 

266.11 273.20 B: oh yeah that was well that wasn't and that was on the news too that wasn't publicized in its entirety was it 

272.51 279.20 A: no it wasn't publicized in entirety and as far you know but what i was gonna say is that should have been more than o. j. should have been 

279.28 282.21 B: yeah that was a real cr- that was really ah 

282.92 285.22 B: and what she did it because um 

285.42 289.72 B: [mn] she wanted to marry somebody who didn't want kids jesus christ 

288.85 291.72 A: yeah they're going through a thing here in 

291.93 297.52 A: i live in nebraska right and uh they're going through a thing right now with a guy that killed his own son 

298.28 306.84 A: and ah they're trying to keep it as quiet as possible but there's parts of it that's come out in the news about the reason the dad killed him was because he uh 

307.04 319.14 A: the devil was talking through the kid and he'd seen six six six on the kid's forehead and all this crap and and i just they were getting a divorce and a lot of people think he did it just so he wouldn't have to pay child support 

312.33 313.82 B: yeah 

319.22 321.51 B: yeah jesus 

320.18 325.78 A: but you know it just there's worse cases than o. j.'s that could that could be on t._v. 

326.06 329.87 A: and it just because of the fam- the he was so famous 

329.47 331.00 B: yeah right 

330.43 332.77 A: you know him and his wife were so famous 

333.01 337.63 B: yeah but it died down now and he's still getting his pension 

337.86 339.92 A: yeah 

339.43 353.55 B: and i saw once there were ah um some woman came up to him ah this was about a year ago some woman came up to him [mn] and said uh hi how are you i'm so pleased to meet you and um [mn] 

354.27 359.90 B: it's a pleasure to meet you and he's all beaming you know there's a very attractive woman 

360.30 368.07 B: [mn] and he's all um beaming and um sucking it up and then she says i never met a murderer before 

367.40 368.67 A: oh god 

368.05 378.79 B: right on national t._v. [laughter] well did that take the wind out of his sails [sigh] boy she did it she really i think she was speaking for a lot of people 

372.80 374.60 A: yeah 

377.71 379.59 A: yeah 

379.44 383.23 B: that's the only reason everybody was interested in him is he made such a fuss on 

383.93 385.49 B: it on the television 

385.91 390.74 B: but ah i dunno i don't i don't see any advantage to uh trials um 

391.14 392.55 B: (( on t._v. )) 

392.51 393.67 A: i don't either 

393.36 397.26 B: matter of fact it made the the l._a._p._d. look like assholes 

396.87 397.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

398.43 399.56 B: [mn] see they was 

398.50 400.56 A: they do that by themselves though 

400.15 403.67 B: and it looks so they looked so damn inefficient and um 

403.74 408.11 B: because i thought he was guilty i dunno i i just thought he was guilty 

408.73 411.75 B: but i guess we've got to go along with the 

412.08 414.10 B: with the justice system 

413.50 414.61 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

415.59 417.65 B: [mn] like it or not 

418.11 420.06 A: [sigh] would you say would you ah 

420.21 431.09 A: if this wouldn't have been televised would have you what would you think about him now if not if you would have known not known about anything other than the fact that he was accused of it and then you found out later he was found innocent 

431.12 433.10 A: would have you thought anything different of him 

433.40 439.27 B: ah no i can't get it out of my mind i remember ah that what was presented and uh 

439.41 442.08 B: just seemed like he did it i guess ah 

440.90 442.64 A: yeah 

443.05 450.67 B: he's innocent and all i realize he's got a but apparently that woman that accosted him on national t._v. thought the same thing 

450.95 453.94 B: i didn't expect it it it was it was really um 

454.29 457.87 B: they didn't make much out of it i think they they sorta played it down 

457.55 459.33 A: yeah 

457.93 461.09 B: because she really hit him she had him up in the air 

461.14 468.65 B: [mn] you know it's a pleasure to meet you and all this and he was you know that smile of his and all that then she hit him with the punch line 

461.44 463.20 A: yeah 

468.43 470.19 A: yeah 

469.50 472.24 B: and it was right on national t._v. and he 

471.32 473.76 A: you know it was probably all set up too 

473.92 476.16 B: yeah might have been set up 

476.64 483.06 B: but i don't i don't think so i i think he was too uh maybe she she had must have had an idea what she was going to do 

476.74 477.71 A: i don't 

482.67 483.91 A: mhm 

483.39 486.49 B: but i don't see how they could have set it up 

486.15 488.89 A: but i think that's the biggest thing i don't like about ah 

488.95 494.24 A: [mn] oh excuse me i don't like about the pub- publicizing on this because 

495.38 497.44 B: they'll be playing to the audience 

496.86 506.72 A: they'll they're playing to the audience and then everybody in the country that watches it forms their own opinion which they're going to do even if it isn't publicized but 

507.01 510.90 A: there's so many people that take the word of lawyers 

511.21 513.87 A: you know just like the um 

514.63 519.24 A: public defender or or whatever her name was i can't even think of what it was now 

519.31 524.25 A: but she said well we found this in his car we found this in his car 

525.58 533.97 A: who's to say somebody didn't put that in there you know i'm not sticking up for him but you know now all these people think well they found those gloves in his car those were his he really did it 

534.07 543.28 A: and somebody could have planted 'em but now all these people have this opinion about him where if it would have never been televised you would've never found out about it 

536.98 538.09 B: yeah 

543.64 546.21 A: a lot of people wouldn't think the way they think about him 

546.37 547.77 B: yeah i see 

546.94 551.58 A: you know that's that's the problem that i have about putting them on a on t._v. 

551.96 555.39 B: well wh- what makes you think it wouldn't have been in the paper if ah 

551.97 552.88 A: (( there's )) 

556.01 560.48 B: if it was um put on television it was part of the evidence 

558.36 559.47 A: well 

560.79 570.53 A: they might have been able to get a court sealed so you know none of this stuff got out and look how many trials that are out there right now for people murdering people and none of it shows up you know 

570.65 578.89 A: they'll say this guy was arrested for it four or five you know maybe more two years down the road it will pop up found innocent for murder back in two thousand 

578.57 580.00 B: (( [mn] [noise] yeah )) 

579.43 584.96 A: you know and that's all you hear about it you don't hear about there was gloves in his car that were bloody 

585.44 591.76 A: and you know stuff like that you just hear he was arrested and later on you might hear he was guilty or not guilty 

591.47 593.00 B: yeah i see what you mean 

595.48 599.89 B: well then they sequester the jury too so they don't be they're not influenced by
