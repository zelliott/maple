51.85 54.01 A: absolutely well i think uh 

54.19 62.87 A: you know just my own idea of it i think the best thing you can do if you really care for your husband and he cares for you is like get him to stop smoking too

82.91 84.11 A: sure 

83.68 94.70 B: yes and so that's why i've been trying to tell him but you know it it i think it's up to the individual that they have to wanna stop at first they have to wanna stop also 

94.24 100.65 A: right well you can tell him you talked to a person that uh 

94.83 96.26 B: yeah 

101.12 102.60 A: was 

102.64 105.91 A: like in this program talking to people about it 

105.35 106.27 B: mhm 

106.00 112.81 A: and uh i can tell you for a fact that uh my father had two different heart operations and the doctor 

113.26 120.44 A: said that it was because of the smoking that was the major damage to his heart 

120.21 123.94 A: and the person that i talked to first 

123.23 124.16 B: uh-huh 

123.70 124.70 A: uh 

124.49 139.35 A: they said their father had died because of it and that he had oh he weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds and he had cancer of the lungs and that took him down to a hundred and five and then he finally died in a very awful way 

131.65 132.69 B: (( mhm )) 

139.12 145.06 B: yes and my dad uh he died of cancer also from smoking and uh 

145.52 152.41 B: and his mother and father also died from smoking from cancer so he know a lot about that you know what it does to you so 

150.33 151.76 A: (( mm mm mm )) 

152.43 157.15 A: and then the i talked to a third person today let me think uh 

159.19 160.55 A: (( i'm trying to think was it )) 

160.97 175.37 A: nah it was the second person you're the third actually and the second person i talked to she said that uh her mother had has now like emphysema and she's been smoking since she was thirteen years old 

174.68 175.88 B: oh 

175.54 179.25 A: so i i mean everything that i talk to people i 

179.58 186.76 A: um i i mean i don't know how they're picking these people to talk to about it it's like it's all really bad news 

186.44 189.13 B: yeah yeah that's true it really is 

188.62 194.72 A: so if they can stop it i mean i was so delighted that uh when i'd been flying before this nine eleven 

194.38 195.45 B: mhm 

194.80 201.72 A: business uh it was like it was no smoking at all on the plane the whole way down and back 

201.52 202.52 B: okay 

202.13 204.62 A: previous to that it was uh 

205.09 213.20 A: i think it was internationally it was no smoking but nationally it was but i think they've even stopped that or hope they have 

213.14 226.42 A: and uh 'cause i there's no way you're getting away from it i mean it's a bad joke if they're if they're smoking in first class and in the back part they're not or i mean i've seen before sections that like it's to this person 

226.72 235.36 A: [laughter] like so far down the aisle and then after that it's the smoking or whatever and it's like [mn] it's just blowing over you know it was it was 

234.61 237.77 B: yeah smoke travels so you really can't get away from it 

236.53 237.59 A: sure 

238.02 243.05 A: and then i was telling the other person uh this last person i talked to i said 

243.74 252.38 A: my wife and some friends we had gotten a a magazine called entertainment magazine in the area baltimore and washington 

252.64 259.34 A: and you get a free entree if you buy one and so we went and they 

260.34 263.14 A: to this one place and it was uh 

263.17 274.60 A: this restaurant where i guess the bar part of it was smoking and i really hate to see that i wanna see that all stopped because i mean i figure if people want to have a drink or two and that's all really 

274.74 285.75 A: it's okay it's no problem to me i figure if they can mind that it's all for themself it's taken internally but when they smoke at these bars it just goes out all over the place 

285.18 288.90 B: yes it spreads to other individuals and they inhaling it and it's all 

288.32 294.43 A: sure sure and they'd have to have a special system which if they really wanted to would 

289.07 290.22 B: yeah that's true 

295.09 306.36 A: have a tremendous powerful updraft it would suck that up right into some type of louvers or vent system and then you wouldn't get any of that but uh they're not about to do that that i can see 

304.83 309.68 B: no they mhm they think about the cost of money if they have to do something like that 

309.16 310.14 A: sure 

309.79 320.27 B: yeah but you know it's it's a lot to have to do with health because they put a lot of chemical and stuff also in that in cigarettes also so to uh to keep the people addicted is what i heard [noise] 

319.44 326.20 A: well sure from what i i saw something and i really believe that it was an article in a magazine and it was showing where 

326.85 331.35 A: they had been growing tobacco i think it was 

331.45 336.79 A: maybe in the dominican republic uh republic but i'm not positive 

336.27 337.16 B: uh-huh 

337.14 340.13 A: and uh they deliberately had a 

340.62 351.81 A: special hybrid tract of tobacco that was especially high in nicotine and yet they would not let the people about this and they were just putting it on the market and 

352.30 358.29 A: uh that's the whole idea they want to get the people that's that are high on the uh 

358.89 366.53 A: being addicted to because of that and it especially really gets me mad when they direct these things like uh 

361.41 362.32 B: uh-huh 

366.55 369.82 A: joe camel to the teenagers and uh 

369.94 377.06 A: and uh and to me i mean if a company had any type of uh morals at all 

377.14 383.25 A: now they're directing it to the to the juveniles and and young people in other countries 

383.15 385.84 B: yeah they're trying to get children addicted yeah 

383.40 384.28 A: (( and i think )) 

385.15 396.73 A: sure they don't and and and i mean that's not stopping at all i mean they talk about oh they're gonna take this money and they're gonna cut back and do this and that i mean that's just lying in their teeth you know 

396.87 401.99 B: yeah that's true because it is in a in a in a business to make profit and make money so 

401.45 402.50 A: sure 

402.52 404.84 B: and it's not really about to stop 

405.08 417.27 A: yeah and i remember being a kid i mean i didn't even know about it and i remember one of the first jobs i had was to cut tobacco and have you ever seen how they do that 

406.12 406.96 B: so 

416.79 421.69 B: yeah i think i seen um a lot of people do it like in a foreign country now uh 

422.35 425.90 B: i've seen ad or something like it showing some peoples doing it 

424.06 425.38 A: yeah 

425.54 435.32 A: i remember i used to work towards i remember when i was a kid i mean you didn't know about that stuff and i mean we would go down to um you say you're from 

435.35 438.14 A: down in georgia right 

437.51 438.51 B: yes uh-huh 

438.17 452.69 A: so uh i'm up here in maryland they raised it a lot down in southern maryland so we'd go down and we'd get a whoever you know it was me and my sister we'd get a nickel whoever saw the first tobacco bed do you know what that is 

449.22 450.06 B: mhm 

452.76 455.77 B: mm some of the leaves tobacco leaves or something 

455.21 465.59 A: no it's a tobacco bed you'll see it's a great big area it's maybe mm looks like it's about oh maybe about 

465.60 472.85 A: a sixth of an acre and they'll have it all covered over like in this tremendous thing like a sheet or cheesecloth 

467.27 468.58 B: (( mhm )) 

473.03 477.69 A: and that's where they start the little baby seedlings from the tobacco seeds 

477.82 481.44 A: and uh when they have field of tobacco 

481.85 495.16 A: they have certain of the biggest and best plants and then when they flower those flowers will have all these little seeds to 'em and they spread broadcast that out and then the tobacco 

495.05 500.22 A: bed keeps it warm and it germinates and then that's where they get all their seedlings from 

500.25 506.91 A: and then they'll have a guy riding out on the back of a tobacco to at the back of a tractor and they go down these 

507.03 511.52 A: uh little rows and they'll be planting these little seedlings 

511.69 518.87 A: and then it comes up with the great big leaves 'cause you know they're about i guess two feet long and uh 

516.98 518.26 B: mhm 

519.53 527.07 A: maybe about eight or ten inches wide and then the plant comes up and it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger 

527.18 533.54 A: and uh i remember when i was a child that we used to see some of the farms going down into 

533.66 536.02 A: uh towards the bay 

536.14 542.01 A: uh on route two fourteen they call it central avenue that's out of uh washington 

542.13 547.30 A: and on there you'd see it would just be a few acres but they would be so 

547.92 554.45 A: uh well irrigated and i hardly ever seeing any places do that where they'd actually lay out pipe 

554.48 562.48 A: and uh they have uh you know it was a beautiful thing to see as far as how wel- well it was growing compared to other places 

562.16 563.30 B: yeah 

562.58 564.57 A: the plants would be so big 

564.61 579.20 A: and uh i remember they had a big old red barn and then they had a big old red mail pouch sign for we're open mail pouch chewing tobacco [laughter] and and i i had even tried some of that stuff like mail pouch and and uh i think red man 

579.29 585.39 A: and uh you know just as a kid you'd say well what's it like and it would have the i guess some sort 

585.74 588.19 A: of sweetening on it 

587.59 592.03 B: yeah they do the chewing some some people just chew it uh 

591.08 595.97 A: yeah right i have chewed it just for the fun of it to see what it was like and and uh 

596.10 597.39 A: so uh 

597.41 599.89 A: then you think well it's gotta be hard on the teeth
