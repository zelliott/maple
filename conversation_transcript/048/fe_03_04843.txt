220.13 230.42 B: yeah that's everybody yes and and you have to be able to get along with every culture you know when we have a a cultural setback did you ever hear in the new york news 

230.18 237.64 B: and they say something like ah a semitic jew was shot because black man ah you know what it was a lack of communication 

236.95 239.69 A: yeah exactly it's usually when a lot of things happen [laughter] 

238.83 240.80 B: right so [laughter] 

239.90 244.26 A: isn't that why we bombed the japanese [laughter] 

241.47 256.38 B: you know yeah [laughter] yeah we're not talking enough you know and and when they were going through the terrorism and storming the mosques they were storming the mosques out here and vandalizing them and you know going through that that same i don't know you 

256.16 262.15 B: got to let people live they didn't have anything to do with it so we know you know as far as we know 

262.02 275.40 B: because now later on they're showing that a lot of these ah religious places or stores or the things that we're putting in supporting that that ethnic group supplies for our neighbourhood was going to terrorism 

262.17 263.92 A: right 

274.72 277.41 A: yeah that's terrible [laughter] 

275.46 282.75 B: so you know you know they said there was a special report here about the handbags that sold on the the the 

282.59 296.01 B: the tables out in the street that they're getting that money and it's going to feed al qaeda or it's going to feed you know the other terrorists and how you don't want to buy any of that stuff even though you were already tempted of buying that stuff you know what i mean 

295.55 297.62 A: right right 

296.21 310.40 B: because it was like the knockoff it looks exactly like whatever prada or gucci it looks exactly like that but it's a knockoff there was shades handbags and electrical equipment on the street who would have known that that would have you know 

307.41 308.36 A: y- 

309.89 324.09 A: yeah that that's supporting terrorists yeah yeah i mean you can't really check the label and oh well you know it's it who cares if it supports terrorism i'll buy it yeah if you knew you wouldn't have bought it yeah you would have you know chased that person to begin with so 

311.37 314.23 B: (( [laughter] you know [laughter] )) 

317.94 322.19 B: right right exactly exactly exactly 

322.98 325.43 B: [laughter] it's so true 

325.03 333.96 A: yeah i know i i think that ah new new york was th- that whole area was the perfect example of what i you know i would hope would happen elsewhere if it you know 

332.41 334.01 B: yes yes 

333.93 340.72 A: y- of course you're going to have some panicking i'm i'm sure i would but for the most part there wasn't very much at all and there was just such a great 

336.53 337.56 B: right 

339.89 347.47 B: no there was a lot of deep breaths focus get wherever and then once you're in a safe place panic all you want 

341.81 343.36 A: yeah there you go 

346.73 349.72 A: yeah [laughter] there you go [laughter] 

347.50 359.94 B: [laughter] that's what it was it really felt like that and that was the general aura no one was playing their music loud in their cars no one was you know what i mean there was we were in this low dull 'cause now we don't know 

356.39 357.61 A: yeah 

359.75 361.57 A: right 

359.87 361.44 B: and and you know 

361.24 373.20 B: it it just reminded me of the movies it really literally was like the movies i i when me being in staten island i'm just right there when you take the staten island ferry from staten island it 

373.14 376.91 B: lets you off at the the trade center and the buildings it's 

376.28 377.23 A: wow 

376.81 382.51 B: you know you can walk right there and when that that particular day it was either 

382.32 392.17 B: and at the time i was changing jobs i was going from greyhound 'cause i used i drove greyhound to you know something local and i was j- j- just having like a feeling like you know 

392.03 403.26 B: i need to be home more than driving the big greyhound bus and that day i'm in there filling out the application to be with this new company and sure enough they said the bomber has just hit 

393.99 395.51 A: yeah 

403.24 415.31 B: you know a a plane has just hit the first building so we thought maybe an accident 'cause kennedy airport goes across you know their flight pattern goes across that area but it doesn't go into it's air space 'cause we got a 

407.18 408.46 A: right 

415.13 421.35 B: a big air space law here where nothing can fly over you so many thousands of feet 

417.07 418.25 A: right 

421.56 422.73 B: so we 

421.71 424.74 A: yeah but you know you figure accident you know yeah 

423.44 437.06 B: exactly right then when the second one came [laughter] the guy was like you know i i would really like to finish this ah interview but we have to go because of you know something happened at the trade you know they called all their vehicles back it was 

437.00 449.52 B: it was really a hectic day they shut the whole city down that was i think that was the most magnificent thing i've ever seen in my life that when when we came together when they shut the city down they closed the borders 

449.27 454.91 A: yeah i mean that was that's not like you know shutting down you know some podunk town [laughter] 

453.01 463.15 B: [laughter] it's really you're right and 'cause we have so many angles and so many areas to be able to come in at 

463.39 464.26 B: where 

464.37 472.59 B: you know ah man and then the national guard came and to this day they just went back up nationally to the orange alert 

472.20 473.37 A: yeah 

472.92 487.29 B: so to this day now y- y- you're still seeing the national guard at the ferry at the train stations at the with the gun with the finger on the trigger you know what i mean not just having it hanging on their back they got the finger on the trigger 

482.28 483.84 A: yeah 

487.52 493.68 B: marching up and down in the immediate area one day i was on fifty ninth and fifth 

493.52 506.01 B: coming from hanging out with the family and they just just stopped the truck it was like the movies they stopped the truck they jumped off the truck and they started running all of them in one direction with the guns drawn 

506.46 511.02 B: you know there's idiots that run with them you know what i mean 

510.98 512.86 A: yeah 

511.07 517.35 B: [laughter] th- that would tell you run the opposite direction [laughter] yeah go the other way 

513.24 516.19 A: th- yeah go the other way [laughter] 

517.05 518.01 A: [laughter] 

517.36 529.41 B: but people followed them to see what's going on i mean i'll see it on the news later i don't need to be directly in the f- line of fire to know what's going 

528.75 535.42 A: yeah i don't have to to have that much detail i can catch it on yeah on the evening news 

530.78 534.67 B: (( [laughter] )) 

534.72 548.90 B: yeah i could be alive and catch it [laughter] oh man but i mean i remember hearing out west that they were testing certain equipment and that they were running a a drill 

536.41 538.31 A: [laughter] yeah exactly 

538.38 539.64 A: yeah 

549.38 558.96 B: i can't remember what state it was but it was toward toward your way but they were running these federal drills and then they went state and locally 

559.05 560.50 B: to you know 

560.06 563.51 A: oh that might have been washington i think seattle did that 

562.31 566.87 B: yeah that's it that's it you're right it was seattle it was seattle 

565.30 570.39 A: yeah they're they're they're more hip than we are [laughter] they're on top of things 

568.30 577.14 B: [laughter] but um but i don't know you go you you do you have like a bomb shelter area or something that you could really go too 

576.91 583.38 A: um none that i'm aware i mean there you know there might be one for government officials or whatever but i i don't know of any so 

579.94 580.96 B: [laughter] 

581.78 582.69 B: right 

582.92 588.99 B: all right you know your nearest schools are good too like something happened you run to the school 

588.65 589.92 A: yeah exactly 

589.23 591.19 B: especially if it's during the day 

592.00 593.13 A: yeah 

592.00 599.95 B: but ah yeah it's it's hard it's hard to know exactly where to go and out here there's so many different places but they're really not safe there's no
