0.31 2.06 B: (( yow how's it going )) 

1.78 4.24 A: very good 

3.09 4.90 B: good i'm charlie 

4.90 10.04 A: hey charlie this is my name is john and i'm in california where are you at 

9.40 13.36 B: i'm in uh elmony california down south 

13.03 14.12 A: (( well okay )) 

13.99 18.02 B: yeah how 'bout that so uh the last couple of times i've been east coasters uh 

18.06 20.06 A: yeah 

18.97 22.82 B: anyway uh so what you got those topics we're talking about 

22.82 24.93 A: yeah 

23.88 28.12 B: w- uh what do you have to say [laughter] i'll hear you before i start blabbing 

28.07 38.51 A: well uh [cough] the topic is terrorism and they said what would you do if there was a how do you think most people would react to to a terrorist attack i think uh most people would react with uh 

38.62 41.37 A: fear and uh you know 

41.26 54.51 A: uncertainty and you know a panic basically i mean i know i would if i was in a situation where there was a terrorist attack it'd it'd probably probably just put me in a daze you know [laughter] 

53.79 62.63 B: yeah yeah okay got ya man yeah if i was involved in it yeah i mean if i was like you know like close to it [lipsmack] i would probably be i 

62.74 71.94 B: mean if i was watching it on t. v. i probably would find it interesting uh you know i wouldn't be too scared i don't think depending on what it was how extreme but uh 

69.74 70.56 A: yeah 

71.72 72.93 A: yeah 

72.33 86.32 B: you know i would if i was anywhere close to it you know i don't know what type of terrorist attack if it was something where it was contagious then i'd be i would definitely be panic stricken man i'd probably be out shopping for all the supplies i need right away 

86.66 100.54 A: [cough] yeah like i said it depends on uh just exactly what the terrorist attack is like a dirty bomb or b- biological or something like that where it's a threat to everybody both in immediate proximity and surrounding areas then 

88.02 89.05 B: yeah 

100.49 107.23 A: (( you know a lot of people would be dragged in and it would be like terrified you know horrific uh experience for everybody )) 

107.62 108.37 A: (( [cough] )) 

108.06 112.99 B: yep yep so what was uh the other things they wanted us to say did did you write it down 

113.32 120.73 A: well that's all they that's all they said was just terrorism and and how do you think most people would react under a terrorist attack you know 

120.12 124.21 B: how most people would react uh how do i think most i mean 

121.78 123.14 A: yeah 

124.52 139.39 B: you know if you've listened to those tapes in new york uh i don't i i didn't see people totally panicked i mean i saw a lot of people that were but i saw a lot of people that weren't as well that were kind of graceful as it was occurring uh 

139.50 143.55 B: so how most people react how would i think most people would react 

143.46 150.91 B: [lipsmack] something similar to that i would say that people would probably react similarly you know i mean but as far as a nuclear 

148.14 149.36 A: yeah 

150.83 162.13 B: or uh something you know real bad like the biological chemical whatever uh i would i judging from what i would do i would think most people would do something similar and that's run to the hills 

162.14 168.61 B: uh as soon as possible uh with whatever you can carry so yeah i think i'd probably overact then panic 

166.30 167.15 A: (( [cough] yeah the )) 

168.64 169.87 B: uh 

169.04 172.05 A: prob- the problem with me is uh i live you know in 

172.27 184.49 A: directly east of san francisco and the prevailing winds uh what they call the delta breeze just blows right over the hill and right straight through here right to the valley 

184.26 186.30 B: oh perfect man so 

185.56 190.88 A: so if anything anything happens over in san francisco the bay area it's all coming right over here 

190.54 192.51 B: how far away are you from san fran 

192.49 194.15 A: about a hundred miles 

194.44 201.39 B: oh okay well you've got some lead time i'm only twelve miles or so less than that away from l. a. i don't know and and 

200.39 201.70 A: (( [cough] the )) 

201.64 202.43 B: and 

201.74 210.83 A: only problem is if you head up in the hills here it's gonna follow you right up there i mean all the winds coming from san francisco straight across the valley and right to the sierras 

211.08 212.34 B: where do you go 

212.24 215.96 A: [lipsmack] yeah that's a good question [laughter] 

214.56 225.68 B: yeah yeah i mean san fran i suppose could be a target uh you know i guess l. a. or long beach is a very nice target because there's a lot of stuff down here that [noise] that's extremely valuable uh 

224.80 226.65 A: yeah important real estate 

227.28 234.33 B: yeah yeah i mean you've got the port of l. a. whatever you know i mean there's there's lots of stuff here that would be i would imagine 

234.44 244.50 B: if not i would think it'd be almost as attractive as new york to [lipsmack] to damage this area make it uninhabitable even uh i don't you know that's just that would be 

241.96 243.56 A: yeah 

244.65 251.58 B: uh unbelievable but yeah i mean i've always thought you know because i have no kids and [cough] i i always thought that 

251.70 253.07 B: i would uh 

253.13 265.03 B: you know i would run to the hills that was my first instinct i i used to have motorcycles and thought that's a good thing to have i always thought in those terms because you know i i read that uh the book the stand did you ever read that book oh 

256.70 258.03 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

264.69 265.77 A: (( no )) 

265.70 275.70 B: okay it's a stephen king book and it's not typical stephen king though but [lipsmack] anyway uh it was something similar to you know a worldwide catastrophe 

269.36 270.17 A: uh-huh 

275.53 276.39 A: uh-huh 

275.56 281.25 B: anyway so i always thought yeah motorcycles are good to have in case you have all the freeways are blocked 

280.98 283.35 A: (( [laughter] yeah yeah [sigh] )) 

281.64 290.51 B: you know you can kinda weave through but uh so yeah i have i have actually given that topic some thought a little bit overall and uh 

291.34 297.01 B: you know i i guess we won't know until it happens and i imagine it will happen like my guess is that it 

297.08 304.23 B: it you know it will happen but [lipsmack] i don't know obviously you don't when or where but you know [mn] 

303.44 308.93 A: yeah you well you know the mindset of these people you know these moslem extremists over there 

309.00 313.06 A: they their goal is to take over the whole world for allah 

312.93 313.26 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

313.25 317.96 A: and so far they've got northern africa they've got the middle east and moving up into west 

317.96 328.85 A: you know e- europe the whole eastern europe area there the former communist uh countries that are mostly moslem and down into down in uh asian area you know throughout throughout there and 

328.77 336.98 A: the fastest growing religion in the world there's more mosques in in uh europe in england right now than there are christian churches 

336.71 337.98 B: i didn't know that 

336.99 346.28 A: and uh you know israel's what stands in their way of controlling the whole middle east and they hate israel the past and they wanna destroy israel 

346.20 355.88 A: and uh that was even the palestinian constitution 'til uh two summers ago when uh clinton required them to remove it but it's still in their hearts 

355.82 365.40 A: and if they and we are the ones who are preventing that from happening 'cause without big brother the united states israel would have a tough time trying to s- survive in that neighborhood over there 

365.34 375.44 A: so that's why they hate us 'cause uh we're preventing their agenda and and until that agenda's uh reached we're gonna continue to back israel and 'cause we're backing israel we're gonna continue to have terrorist threats 

375.61 380.17 A: so i don't think it's something that's gonna go away it's just going to continue and continue and continue uh 

380.14 388.66 A: you know like the bible says there's gonna be uh you know this kind of a war over there it's it's just gonna drag the whole world into the war and then it's gonna end up being the last 

388.67 395.17 A: final war and you know the battle of armageddon which will the return of christ but preceding that will be a 

395.01 406.79 A: one world government and one world religion headed by the false prophet and the anti christ so it's all shaping up according to the bible and bible prophecy we're just the generation that get to see it all coming to pass i believe 

406.70 410.37 B: wow all right man all right i hope that's incorrect man it 

410.39 422.76 B: is somewhat frustrating that if if indeed that is uh you know the story of religion and all that i mean which i i think i've heard that as well uh you know [noise] that's that's pretty irritating but uh 

418.61 419.55 A: yeah 

423.34 437.54 B: you know i mean the fact is that if we apparently if we wanted to we could absolutely crush 'em but it'll never come to that uh no we'll never use what we have and and it hasn't been justified yet to use what we have to 

431.49 432.39 A: no 

436.90 438.57 A: that's right [mn] 

437.89 450.46 B: to demolish 'em but i would guess that you know a- attack a little attack a little more severe than the one we just had uh i think could justify something extreme on our end as well 

449.22 458.68 A: yeah yeah it's just something that's just probably unfortunately uh just gonna become uh persistent and and and probably uh continue to get worse 

459.21 460.13 B: (( yeah )) 

459.43 474.34 A: you know you introduce the biological or radiological you know elements to this whole thing and in populated areas over here and you know the idea is to blackmail us to keep us uh from being involved over there so they can obtain their agenda 

474.41 485.37 A: and that very very well could happen you know if you you know let of a the right time stuff over here it'd definitely sour our country to you know we'd just be looking out for ourselves and 

484.55 489.74 B: well i mean if something i think if something really bad happened like let's say something like uh 

489.72 490.60 B: you know 

490.41 505.08 B: nuclear or or dirty bomb or something biological something i think if something like that really happened like in l. a. or whatever i i do believe that that would probably be the end of several regimes out there and probably hundreds of thousands of people 

505.07 511.34 B: especially by the way we reacted to this one i mean you know after this it looks like you know we've taken out 

507.32 508.52 A: yeah 

511.45 520.43 B: uh afghanistan not that we've killed millions of people doing it but you know and now iraq you know and so there is a lot of other nations you know 

515.51 516.69 A: right 

520.46 524.94 B: that i think would be really in deep deep crap if uh 

525.14 533.32 B: if something really really bad happened i do think that we're going to react i think that the nation will want us to react i know i would you know but 

532.56 542.16 A: yeah it's a matter of survival and like uh like with the statements that were made hey the u. n. can say what they want and they can do what they want but you know what we've gotta protect ourselves [laughter] 

541.20 551.75 B: i i wonder how much support you know i would imagine that if something extremely bad happened here that you know we would get some support from uh those other nations uh russia 

551.68 566.35 B: uh you know germany and and you know i don't know about france i don't you know you always hear bad crap about 'em but i don't know i mean i would think that you know anybody would support a just cause like that i mean if you're attacked like that i mean 

563.68 564.66 A: yeah 

566.56 569.99 B: i wonder what it is that's their mindset why they don't 

570.37 574.84 B: um why they're thinking so differently about things than we do i mean 

574.48 584.52 A: well their problem was they were in dire straits financially as a nation france and germany and and russia and this was a windfall for them 'cause they were all making millions off of uh 

584.52 598.62 A: off the whole deal selling uh the stuff that they were supposed to be selling and selling stuff they weren't supposed to be selling and then then they knew if we got in there it would stop all that money flowing and also expose uh the the underhanded stuff that they've been doing 

598.75 599.96 A: so they were opposed
