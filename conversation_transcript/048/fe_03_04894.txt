13.79 14.91 A: hello 

14.62 17.38 B: oh ho yeah what's going on man 

17.53 18.92 A: ah not much 

18.40 21.99 B: oh all right so what's your feeling and your take on that 

22.10 25.27 A: on the uh televised high profile crimes 

25.14 26.45 B: yeah 

26.06 28.81 A: i believe that they should be profiled 

28.61 34.12 B: okay that's a good concept so it's a good idea your pros 

34.87 38.10 A: uh i believe that if they i mean 

38.47 42.60 A: even if the people are high profile i mean that doesn't mean 

42.77 51.86 A: that they're out of the you know the long arm of the law and that they should be treated just like everyone else is treated you know 

46.70 48.15 B: mhm 

51.83 58.70 A: if you hear of like a kidnapping and it it's just regular people and you know there's a kidnapping that's televised so 

58.93 59.96 B: mhm 

59.20 62.91 A: like on the local news i believe that it should be televised 

62.61 75.00 B: right because it is news and it's newsworg- worthy i understand yeah i have uh similar feelings to take to that you know i don't really mind that it is televised it gives me an update as to 

64.73 66.38 A: yeah 

67.01 67.83 A: yes 

75.14 78.67 B: in my opinion who's right and wrong you know 

77.58 78.72 A: exactly yeah 

78.85 85.80 B: if the crime has been committed well that's the wo- we got to do as a society let's do the right thing 

86.00 88.09 A: yeah it's kinda like a 

88.62 91.20 A: i guess a a media 

91.28 94.79 A: spawned uh what you may call it what's the name of it yeah 

94.41 97.17 B: (( frenzy really [laughter] thank god )) 

95.64 97.52 A: yeah it's a fr- it's a frenzy 

97.27 101.59 B: yeah because they blow it they hype it up and they blow it more so out of proportion 

97.54 98.82 A: yeah 

101.57 102.64 A: exactly 

101.80 102.92 B: than all truth 

103.04 110.41 B: they really do but that's okay too because what we as a society we like uh the drama you know 

110.34 115.37 A: exactly we all we're all we're making they're making their money because we're sitting and watching it 

110.64 111.51 B: we want 

114.86 116.67 B: absolutely 

117.34 123.88 B: but the sad part is is that people have to go through some ugly experiences you know 

123.21 124.03 A: yeah 

124.43 129.22 B: and that's the people that really got hurt in you know that we should be concerned about 

129.07 135.66 A: exactly and from watching watching all the uh like i know everybody at one time watches 

129.58 130.55 B: (( you know )) 

135.81 141.46 A: you know watches the news and stuff and i i figure that it should be like 

137.73 139.13 B: mhm 

142.09 146.44 A: kind of like a history lesson you learn what not to do you know 

145.59 147.13 B: right yes 

146.51 153.55 A: to better ourselves however we still [laughter] we still don't learn at least i but a large majority of us 

150.15 151.10 B: right 

151.48 152.49 B: well [laughter] 

152.98 158.44 B: what's the adage in life that history will repeat itself well it does 

156.93 158.07 A: exactly 

158.46 167.62 B: well it does one at a it's on a individual basis yes whether it's on a individual basis or a collective we always will 

158.60 159.73 A: yeah we're st- 

159.91 161.50 A: we're still stuck in the rut 

166.24 167.13 A: yes 

168.07 169.60 B: (( you know it's sad )) 

170.50 172.93 B: uh so where you calling from 

172.95 174.74 A: i'm from houston 

174.54 176.77 B: houston is new york 

177.06 178.22 B: (( ah )) 

178.00 179.39 A: it's pretty far [laughter] 

178.96 182.15 B: yeah it is across country buddy [laughter] 

181.85 183.40 A: where you at 

182.82 184.41 B: in new york city 

184.08 185.63 A: new york city 

184.78 186.21 B: mhm 

185.64 187.76 A: i've always wanted to go there 

186.74 191.16 B: yeah yeah it's always jumping that's for damn sure man there's 

191.23 192.30 A: (( yeah )) 

191.32 194.93 B: al- always something going on always 

194.96 198.60 A: yeah there is there is a lot of stuff that happens in houston too 

197.46 208.69 B: mhm well again going with the topic you know i mean the potential with things happening here in the city opposed to i don't know where what city you're living in what city is it 

198.64 199.58 A: like 

201.09 202.81 A: (( yeah )) 

208.74 212.00 A: it's uh it's newcanie it's in the houston area 

210.81 216.82 B: all right so it's a smaller town community right population of what three thousand 

213.63 214.50 A: yes 

216.61 218.81 A: mm ah it's probably more like 

217.52 219.29 B: fifty thousand 

218.94 221.29 A: twelve thousand or something like that 

219.77 224.13 B: okay wow so that's really secluded to some extent 

223.92 225.64 A: yeah 

224.33 232.31 B: so th- the chances of it happening there opposed to happening where i am are so much greater in odds yeah 

230.10 231.83 A: yeah 

232.55 241.02 B: but yeah yeah well i i like the fact that they put it on t._v. and let the public judge it all it 

239.70 243.33 A: yeah it's uh to let them know what's going on around us you know 

242.25 243.09 B: right 

242.98 254.58 B: but here's the thing we as a society as we watch it and want to judge it we don't have a final say so in the matter because it's the way the law is written and the way the law reads 

254.46 260.29 B: is that's the way it is so we don't have an active participation we're just or a viewer 

260.45 262.14 A: yeah 

260.99 264.01 B: you know and that's the downside to it too because 

264.39 270.74 B: there could be convincing evidence to the general public that otherwise is the case you know 

270.83 280.03 A: yeah it's like we we don't know the whole side we don't know the whole truth of what like all the perspectives of the the victims and 

274.93 276.41 B: right 

277.09 278.06 B: mhm 

278.54 284.40 B: like yeah like when the judge throws out this i won't allow this and i won't allow that you know 

284.50 290.90 B: as a part of information that if we had we known we could of considered yeah 

291.01 292.62 B: (( yeah absolutely )) 

293.37 296.36 B: mm so what's the weather like there in houston 

296.38 300.96 A: ah it's it's clear right now it's pretty hot it's a bit hot 

299.28 300.35 B: yeah 

300.39 302.50 B: when you say hot nineties 

302.84 305.49 A: try like it's ninety eight 

305.20 309.10 B: wow that yeah that is hot shit we didn't even get there yet 

309.34 310.97 B: we can't wait for it though 

309.61 312.17 A: yeah we have a lot of hum- uh humidity too

343.79 345.09 A: [laughter] 

344.62 353.88 B: maybe think about changing the name uh you know you might get a little bit better publicity on the receivable side you know what i mean don't get too out there 

351.64 352.95 A: yeah we're 

353.96 359.03 A: uh it's pretty people are like man that's go- that's older then we shouldn't 

357.16 362.39 B: well it is man you gotta tone it down a little bit 'cause the general masses don't appreciate it you know

381.03 383.00 A: i like keeping it raw 

382.73 387.87 B: (( no i hear you man and it's um your own way of doing it i think it [laughter] )) 

388.60 389.44 B: that's so 

388.78 390.15 A: so what do you do for a living

401.96 403.07 B: mhm 

404.17 412.43 B: well wha- what newspapers you guys get up to the houston times i would think something like that what's the most local newspaper for you guys 

409.15 410.64 A: yeah like uh 

412.78 416.98 A: ooh i'm not really sure i usually read the houston chronicle 

416.37 421.57 B: mhm well getting with the local top- i mean the topic again you know 

421.83 423.15 B: viewing 

423.27 426.93 B: uh this high publicity uh crimes 

427.40 429.07 B: and celebrities 

429.08 430.43 B: on t._v. 

430.54 433.67 B: i'm glad they do it i am glad they do mm 

432.16 441.96 A: i'm glad they do it on on on some of on some of the cases i think they do they like show too much and like like for instance like the o._j. simpson trial 

440.87 441.93 B: mhm 

442.28 449.78 A: they it it was like real big and then it died down and then they brought it like dug it back up and it's like you don't need to be digging this up 

446.57 447.67 B: yeah 

448.39 461.93 B: right the aftermath after the first one and the first process is over with and whoever wins they win leave it alone you know then just stop pursuing it this way and that way and this way 

457.00 457.98 A: exactly 

462.26 470.58 B: that's crazy at that point leave it alone you know if he got away with it he got away with it sh- you know shame on us as a as a people you know 

465.31 466.43 A: exactly 

470.55 471.44 A: yeah 

471.35 474.07 B: if we keep a for that one that's all 

471.94 473.38 A: yeah for just 

474.11 476.74 A: guzzling that stuff down you know [laughter] 

475.91 477.23 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

478.22 486.62 A: i think it's like if the crimes are minuscule that they really ah it really doesn't matter if they show that stuff i mean i think if it's like 

478.46 479.54 B: (( yeah )) 

487.24 498.63 A: if it's uh like a bigger problem or like they did something like murdered someone or or it's a it's a rape thing or something then i i understand and but i mean if it's like 

491.23 492.66 B: mhm 

494.04 495.45 B: right mhm 

497.82 504.46 B: if it's a petty crime or a less violent yeah then you don't have to watch it 

499.37 500.64 A: yeah a petty crime 

504.63 505.86 A: yeah exactly 

505.08 508.58 B: and you know maybe because it's they made that high exposure 

508.59 518.95 B: and that the crime doesn't call for it you know doesn't warrant it but the way our uh news media works they don't care they'll take the smallest story and blow it out of proportion 

518.87 522.19 A: exactly they i mean they don't give a they don't care if they ruin people's lives 

519.59 521.05 B: they've seen that too 

521.52 526.96 B: right we've seen that to us as society as we read the information [laughter] shit 

527.05 528.36 B: and that 

527.13 530.27 A: as long as we feed on it it'll always be there you know 

529.31 535.33 B: mhm there's a story out there every day and one fabricated to go with it you know 

536.12 546.88 A: because i mean without that that's what just that's just what makes us without that we don't have movies we don't have you know anything to to empty our wallets and our pay checks 

543.48 544.27 B: right 

544.36 545.07 B: (( yeah )) 

545.81 553.49 B: mhm right we don't help the economy we don't go and entertain ourselves we walk around being pretty pted off people 

553.47 554.63 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

554.98 558.12 B: yeah just working all the time that'll make you mad 

558.07 560.85 A: oh yeah [laughter] i know what that is 

558.67 559.93 B: (( you know so )) 

560.53 573.38 B: absolutely but again i'm i'm real glad that they do show it but they do they can get ah over expose it too you know that's the downside to it like we spoke about earlier 

570.01 571.00 A: (( yeah )) 

573.23 576.89 A: i mean everything done in like you know in a moderate level 

576.29 577.65 B: mhm 

577.04 582.50 A: but they always push it as far as it'll go until they're not allowed or whatever 

581.38 591.82 B: mhm well my concerns in this get the facts out let people hear it and view it whatever the evidence is and make the decision shouldn't have to be so long i mean 

592.00 595.33 B: obvious shit is obvious stuff you know what i mean 

595.14 596.18 A: (( yeah )) 

595.67 599.95 B: um if it's blatant then we ain't got to go through the whole proc-
