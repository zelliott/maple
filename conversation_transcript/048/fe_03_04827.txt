0.18 1.54 A: hi i'm scott 

1.10 2.62 B: hi i'm erin 

3.14 4.37 A: nice to meet ya 

4.30 6.16 B: [laughter] yeah like what 

6.20 7.10 A: ah 

7.21 9.74 A: ah so i guess we have to talk about terrorism 

9.38 10.98 B: [laughter] 

9.82 12.64 A: great um where do you live actually 

12.37 14.22 B: i'm in florida 

13.62 15.59 A: oh really which part 

14.26 18.78 B: yeah ah hope sound it's ah west palm beach area 

18.17 21.18 A: yeah i know exactly i was born and raised in miami 

20.57 21.88 B: oh okay 

21.24 23.25 A: i know exactly 

22.78 24.15 B: where are you at 

23.54 25.66 A: right now i'm in d._c. actually 

25.32 26.25 B: oh 

25.97 29.86 A: so i guess the subject matter actually pertains a little 

29.93 35.73 B: close to home [laughter] yeah 

30.55 34.54 A: a little close to home here [laughter] definitely i've been through a 

34.70 37.49 A: couple of elevated alerts already 

37.96 43.17 B: yeah i saw that ah what last night that you were up to high 

42.67 45.14 A: yeah up to up to orange 

44.72 48.96 B: now i haven't heard anything about why they think that or 

49.08 50.80 B: what that's about 

50.52 54.93 A: yeah they're just saying it's a standard they heard some chatter [laughter] 

54.18 55.73 B: (( hm )) 

54.96 57.86 A: they thought they'd raise it um 

58.00 59.88 A: yeah so 

59.21 66.78 B: so i guess the question is whether people would panic or remain calm during a terrorist attack 

66.49 69.93 A: yeah and i would tend to say panic 

70.28 72.67 A: and panic wildly 

72.38 75.50 B: i would think so too mainly because 

75.77 81.24 B: um i think the media has a big part in how it's kind of feeding fears 

81.35 87.40 B: and if people are afraid that's why that's where panic comes from it's from fear 

86.21 96.26 A: i would agree whole heartedly and also i just think you know it doesn't matter how familiar you might be with war or terrorism or whatever else when it happens and happens near you 

87.80 88.84 B: (( what )) 

96.37 100.22 A: or happens to someone close to you you still freak out i mean 

99.58 101.87 B: yeah and i think now 

101.93 107.29 B: when w- if since because we are in a sense expecting it 

107.36 117.23 B: we won't know it's some accident that a plane just happened to crash into a tower it's rather that we know it's [laughter] on purpose and i guess that's where 

116.60 118.22 A: (( exactly the )) 

117.46 119.32 B: we fear it's scary 

118.25 125.74 A: the burden of proof has shifted from you know we think it's an accident and then it's proven otherwise to oh my goodness it's a terrorist attack and it 

126.11 130.99 A: takes a few minutes to realise oh no it's just the engine blew out or something like that or 

127.62 130.28 B: (( mhm )) 

130.66 131.33 B: [laughter] 

131.48 139.23 A: or it's just some you know crazy guy who you know has a bomb and it wasn't a planned organized terrorist group activity 

137.65 140.32 B: (( mhm )) 

139.50 145.15 A: but ah yeah i would tend to think ah people would actually be very very panicked um 

145.70 154.18 A: and ah and and i the public i think the public reaction that will actually make a any sort of terrorist attack even more worse than 

154.27 161.05 A: than just the action itself an injury i think just you know you can just imagine the highways 

161.06 172.30 A: and all the thoroughfares out of there would be so packed and people would probably not care about one another and just want to get out of there as fast as possible and get their loved ones out that sort of thing 

169.18 171.03 B: mhm 

172.19 179.65 B: yeah i think that that you're probably very right on that because any terrorist attack is going to be 

179.67 192.69 B: a surprise that would that that that was what they thought of i mean who knows what they could do next and and just the s- the element of surprise is what's what's um scary too 

192.40 193.46 A: exactly 

193.39 207.62 A: especially with you know the concerted effort to try to minimize it or fight it or you know prepare for it you know so all of a sudden if there's an attack it's going to be well the government didn't know about this couldn't they couldn't prevent it either 

207.59 209.01 B: mhm 

207.73 211.57 A: and you know it means we're never safe and no matter what they do 

212.07 218.65 B: i wonder though what kind of reaction would happen in the government under a a if 

219.20 220.76 B: how much ah 

221.74 225.39 B: reaction they would have if if there was another attack i 

225.67 227.51 B: mean are they would they go 

227.20 227.76 A: (( [cough] )) 

227.61 231.25 B: straight away to the to the issue or would they 

231.99 237.21 B: have to sort through things and and find out you know what i'm saying how 

236.37 238.02 A: (( right i sort of do and you )) 

238.21 245.93 A: know and the guy wants to they probably want to sort it out you know they try to have a couple of teams you know one being like the f._b._i. who will take immediate control of the situation 

245.87 257.81 A: meanwhile i'm sure everyone else in back in washington state and local governments would probably take a little more due diligence as trying to realise what happened why it happened where is the breakdown in 

257.90 260.35 A: intelligence that sort of thing you 

259.72 267.09 B: mhm what i think too i think they've had so many high alerts ever since nine eleven 

260.72 261.87 A: (( you know )) 

267.26 274.09 B: and we haven't seen anything and i think sometimes that really 

274.92 282.88 B: i don't know to what extent we really necessarily need to be on high alert or or that they need to keep telling us that you know what i'm saying 

282.30 284.20 A: well absolutely 

284.27 295.74 A: i mean at the same time though theoretically a high alert which you know invokes you know millions of dollars 'cause you step up police and you step up procedures and everything else they're supposed to 

293.58 297.56 B: well tell the police though but the the general public i think 

297.80 302.34 B: to i think it instills more fear than necessary 

301.42 309.02 A: possibly but you don't know you know if there was going to be a terrorist attack that all of a sudden they decided not to pull it off because of it 

309.05 309.81 B: (( mm )) 

309.06 322.11 A: i mean i agree as far as the public perception goes as far as you know the way they look at it the way i even think about it i agree with you is that yeah as extra high alerts and nothing ever happens and you know i don't pay much heed though but ah 

321.90 329.01 B: but i think do you th- think that people are really any more um alert than they would be otherwise 

328.67 329.60 A: no 

329.93 333.01 B: that's what i'm yeah i just 

333.02 340.49 B: i think it i think there's more harm in in bringing fear into the community rather than um 

340.84 343.02 B: not having those signs at all 

343.19 348.66 B: i think you know what i'm saying if if we they had no no high alert for the pub- general public to see 

348.77 356.45 B: i don't think we're going to be in any more any less danger without that than we would be with it 

355.70 358.27 A: yep i agree with that 

357.90 361.73 B: i don't know that but that it just seems seems that way 

363.24 364.97 A: yeah 

364.59 365.35 B: (( mm )) 

365.48 366.72 B: [laughter] 

365.50 370.98 A: i hear that since it's it's an issue you know you just don't want to think about all that much 

371.21 373.55 A: you kind of hope it just doesn't happen or 

371.45 372.24 B: [laughter] 

374.03 376.38 A: we can prepare better but 

377.15 377.98 B: (( mm )) 

377.61 384.73 A: it's something you don't want to really it's pretending you know and be like wow sometimes it's harder to like criticize a government agency or could you know 

384.78 390.43 A: be like in the ocean and have high alerts 'cause um someone's scared of the alternative as well 

391.67 395.94 A: as far as you know glossing over and you know people people get used to 

396.05 398.13 A: a certain ah 

398.14 406.01 A: opinion they get used to a certain way of life and in the eighties and nineties everything was late eighties or you know mid nineties 

406.31 416.91 A: everything was fine in america and you know there wasn't really that much terrorist activity even overseas too much as far as like plane crashes and everything else and i think people just got very lax 

417.51 418.69 A: and ah 

417.62 419.07 B: mhm 

418.71 423.61 A: you know they really took away a lot of the airport security they once had and you know 

424.09 432.96 A: it seems like and it it it does seem like the pendulum's probably swung ov- you know certainly right after right after nine eleven it swung the other way and it was an extreme 

432.72 434.83 B: (( mm yeah )) 

433.34 443.78 A: an extreme view and now they're still trying to figure out exactly where that middle is where they can really gauge to try to protect the people as well as keep people safe at the same time and not 

444.30 446.91 A: trounce all over ah people's rights 

449.53 451.06 B: (( [sigh] well ah that's )) 

451.61 465.93 B: an issue i don't the whole security issue is what what confuses me too the whole homeland security and and what the president's done on that so far and and if they 

466.86 480.21 B: i don't know how that works hand in hand with um the alert system that they've got and i'd like to know more about um how the homeland security coincides with 

480.41 483.03 B: the alert system 

483.41 491.74 B: and when when they choose to go high and do they sometimes not have a high alert because the homeland security is in place 

491.81 500.66 B: or is it you know we're a- without without homeland security would we be at the highest level of alert right now or 

500.04 501.03 A: yes 

501.33 504.17 B: i- i- i- i i just wonder if it's really doing it's 

504.96 507.87 A: i mean i don't know exactly how efficient it's been 

504.97 506.53 B: if it's effective 

507.93 518.79 A: 'cause as i said i don't think they're going to release a lot of statistics on that but theoretically the idea of that i guess when the f._b._i. and c._i._a. and n._s._a. intercept 

510.80 511.65 B: [laughter] 

519.02 524.51 A: an in- of credible intelligence to suggest that there could very likely be 

524.98 527.22 A: a event soon 

527.04 529.18 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

527.50 532.05 A: if we're on a high alert and then that's supposed to release um 

532.82 541.72 A: ah ah ah the homeland security then issues that alert and then apparently federal state and all local you know sort of law enforcement agencies and governments have 

539.82 540.64 B: mhm 

541.94 546.36 B: but could it become a a peter cries wolf type situation 

542.08 542.76 A: or 

546.69 553.69 B: where they're they're always crying high alert high alert and after a while we're just kind of getting numb to that does it it 

552.56 553.39 A: yeah 

553.71 567.60 A: but i you know i'm not i guess my only thing is it's really not necessarily for us i mean i i know you know they like to make it sound like we need to be more alert but i think it's just more of the fact of whoever's trained and and all the policemen all the governments 

567.54 568.94 A: you know that they 

569.35 583.05 A: they're going to still do their jobs you know so yeah i mean i think us us as a public will b- get very desensitized very quickly and not even really realise that in you know it'll get to a point we'll be like oh you know let we had and who will know 

570.88 572.04 B: yeah 

583.08 589.62 A: um but ah you know as long as the people who are supposed to be really taking care of that still do 

589.97 591.76 A: i'll be happy 

590.08 592.31 B: (( mhm mm )) 

593.16 595.24 B: until the next event then 

595.25 597.31 B: then we'll be all 

595.39 596.18 A: right 

596.80 599.01 A: then they'll change the entire system again 

598.14 599.89 B: they'll then we'll be d- defence
