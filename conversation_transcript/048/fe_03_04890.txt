7.56 9.98 B: um yes this is my second one 

9.62 12.41 A: this is my second as well actually 

12.74 16.04 A: i figured for the money you know what the heck [noise] 

15.48 21.32 B: [laughter] it's been interesting actually for the ten minutes the first time around went rather quickly 

20.67 30.11 A: i wasn't too i wasn't too pleased with yesterday's topic but no i was kinda just ah we we finished in like three minutes we're like okay um let's fill some time now 

23.73 25.11 B: no [laughter] 

29.65 32.37 B: what's next right [laughter] 

31.22 32.84 A: yeah um 

33.65 40.53 A: [noise] yeah i guess ah with this topic i [mn] i don't see the harm in it it can raise public awareness of certain things so 

40.70 48.84 A: you know that's a no i've never really watched one i don't see any really need to but i i you know i don't see any harm in it 

49.08 62.67 B: i know that well i i know the power of television as far as um bringing the news to us and [noise] the way it influences public opinion so i suppose there'd be pros and cons to both sides and [noise] 

55.61 68.97 A: oh yeah well i get you know i mean once the trial's under way you're not going to influence the jury unless they're you know watching t._v. that they're not supposed to but 

68.99 72.88 A: you know i guess [laughter] that happens but um 

70.76 71.53 B: right 

71.70 72.40 B: (( right [noise] )) 

73.20 75.79 A: you know i i guess ah you know 

76.17 82.76 A: as far as that's concerns yah it could do some influencing in ways that maybe it's not supposed to but ah 

83.21 84.89 A: you know i i guess 

86.41 89.71 A: my mind on it is just ah [noise] 

89.54 103.76 A: when it comes to like televised trials and stuff i i i really don't see the harm in it especially if it's used properly i think that a lot of the time the media gets out of hand and kinda forms their own opinions before you know 

100.77 101.77 B: right 

103.71 105.57 A: i mean this whole 

104.32 105.12 B: (( right mhm )) 

106.08 114.02 A: ah scott petersen thing [noise] [sigh] we all think he did it you know and and you know chances are he did 

110.76 111.60 B: uh-huh 

112.32 116.31 B: [noise] yeah we've already [noise] yeah we've already tried him before he's actually been tried and 

115.52 118.82 A: yeah chances are he did but that's not for us to say 

118.47 123.65 B: right exactly and and that would be my only concern would be whether 

123.79 125.30 B: whether the um 

125.34 138.37 B: the information that's put out and whether the reporting could be totally so unbiased so that each person was able to form their own feelings on it without being swayed one way or the other um 

130.88 132.87 A: (( [noise] right )) 

137.76 139.19 A: right 

138.59 147.74 B: public opinion is so strong and so so powerful that its influence i don't know what its influence could be or would be 

141.25 143.02 A: right 

147.78 156.67 A: right you know and then there's the monetary side we do pay per views suddenly we've reduced the national debt a bit you know [noise] [laughter] [laughter] but you know 

147.80 149.49 B: um and 

153.56 154.25 B: right 

154.31 155.93 B: [laughter] 

157.37 159.42 B: yeah exactly well 

158.62 163.29 A: live from california the scott petersen trial only nine ninety five 

162.83 167.82 B: [laughter] oh gosh rea- new a new sort of reality t._v. right 

167.15 171.59 A: hey why not they've done everything else [laughter] 

169.09 170.48 B: [laughter] oh 

170.60 172.87 B: well actually um 

173.20 180.08 B: i suppose it it has its merits and it's probably interesting to some people i don't watch a whole lot of t._v. up here 

180.12 187.36 A: ah the only thing i ever watch on court t._v. is um you know the forensic files and things like that you know so 

180.74 181.65 B: [laughter] 

185.85 186.87 B: mhm 

187.40 191.99 A: i guess after the fact kinda things ah you know i don't 

189.43 190.19 B: yeah 

191.96 205.98 A: really care what's going on in a trial you know it's like i said it's not for me to decide and you know if i'm in the trial that's a different story you know if i'm a juror that's a different story then yes i i need to watch that trial [laughter] obviously ah 

199.60 200.43 B: yeah 

203.84 205.32 B: right right 

205.88 211.62 A: if i'm you know watching it on t._v. then you know it doesn't really matter what i think does it you know [sigh] 

210.89 223.22 B: it doesn't it doesn't for those of us um [noise] either one way or the other but don't don't you think that there probably is a contingency of public that probably be very drawn to something like that 

214.69 216.20 A: but um 

222.59 228.48 A: well sure and if it's a high profile trial and you're gonna televise it then you need to sequester the jury 

229.04 231.48 B: yes so that they're not influenced by the outside 

230.88 242.39 A: right [noise] i mean you just can't you know you just can't say well okay we'll just trust them to do the right thing because they're going to talk to their brother or their sister or whoever aunt mabel whatever you know 

242.31 243.47 B: (( yep mhm [noise] yeah )) 

242.59 245.27 A: and they're gonna go and they're gonna you know 

245.10 250.03 B: it's not like being home and not being able to talk about the trial i mean it would be all over [laughter] 

245.32 246.12 A: [noise] 

248.89 250.58 A: right 

250.62 258.20 A: [noise] so you know they're going to go yeah or they're going to turn on the t._v. and watch trial highlights and go wow you know what do you think of that you know 

255.66 256.57 B: mhm 

258.60 259.49 A: you know 

259.37 260.54 B: yeah 

260.44 270.58 A: there you know in those trial highlights unfortunately that wouldn't be a bad thing except for the fact that you know maybe as you said the press has put a biased spin on it already you know 

269.91 271.14 B: right 

270.65 274.55 A: i mean let's face it every major trial we've had in the last ten years 

274.35 278.46 A: has been covered in one form or another and every major trial we've had in the last ten years 

278.25 290.73 A: has had a biased spin one w- you know either yes he or she did do it or yes he or she didn't do it or yes there were mitigating circumstances and you know even though they did it they should get off or whatever it might be 

291.04 291.84 B: right 

291.08 296.46 A: that has happened over the past ten years you know ever since things like court t._v. came into being 

293.61 294.28 B: right 

296.60 301.65 B: so maybe part of the part of the question that needs to be looked at is is um 

301.80 306.37 B: does it violate civil rights or are rights you know 

306.49 309.88 B: the the rights of the person who's being tried 

309.74 314.34 A: i think there's a place for everything including televising a trial 

313.96 314.94 B: mhm 

314.33 327.35 A: but i think if you're going to televise a trial you know like i think you know i mean in cases where a trial is so high profile if you don't televise it people are going to find a way of talking about it anyway 

318.81 320.15 B: there's a responsibility 

327.54 330.93 A: you might as well televise it but you might as well sequester as well 

330.95 331.89 A: you know 

331.32 332.52 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

331.91 333.51 A: um you know 

332.53 338.62 B: well i say yeah the jury would have to be sequestered just for the sake of the person being tried because otherwise [noise] see how it 

336.99 342.29 A: exactly and if if you're dealing with a 

338.71 339.59 B: trial 

343.79 354.20 A: if you're dealing with a situation where you're televising a a trial that is high profile you know it it may be something you need to televise i you know 

354.08 368.48 A: i i think that just about any child rape tri- trial should be televised you know any- anything that involves you know crimes against the severely innocent who can't defend themselves you know ought to be televised you know 

368.25 379.91 B: maybe the other part of this though that needs to be looked at too would be putting it on certain channels so that it's not just open to public to a certain age level because you're gonna have a lot of gory grisly details 

375.94 378.72 A: (( [noise] sure [noise] [noise] )) 

379.26 386.96 A: well that's i think the same thing should apply with prime time television you can't show certain things after you know before nine p._m. 

380.17 380.91 B: (( [noise] right )) 

382.98 383.74 B: right 

387.04 389.69 A: you know and that's fine 

389.71 390.54 B: mhm 

389.89 394.88 A: but you know the main thing is with all that if you're going to televise it you have to sequester 

394.75 395.92 B: yeah 

395.98 396.86 A: you know 

396.71 398.62 B: yeah i absolutely agree [noise] 

397.08 401.80 A: because there should be no access from the jury to any kind of press 

401.91 406.16 A: [noise] you know they they should not be given the opportunity [noise] 

405.09 405.90 B: right 

407.00 408.77 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

408.84 414.15 A: so you know that's the you know that's basically where i stand on the whole thing is you know 

414.47 424.24 A: if it's something that you know is that important that you feel it needs to be televised that the you know the world n- needs to know about it or at least the nation 

424.23 432.04 A: then you know you need to make sure that you you know sequester the jury because the jury's the most important part of that trial 

432.80 436.22 A: [noise] and if the jury is [noise] 

436.51 438.48 B: (( mhm if it's tainted )) 

437.15 450.28 A: um you know if the jury is tainted then yes you are you are doing a disservice you know to that person whether they're guilty or innocent or otherwise [noise] you know [noise] [noise] so darling daddy's on the phone right now 

446.86 447.82 B: mhm 

450.06 452.67 B: it would be interesting to see um 

453.19 454.19 B: you know 

454.65 460.88 B: you always going into something new and you don't know what the repercussions are going to be until after you've maybe tried it 

454.68 457.89 A: (( [noise] )) 

460.22 461.98 A: well yeah um 

460.91 461.67 B: you know 

461.70 466.05 B: so i think it would be interesting to go forward and see you know and then 

462.33 463.44 A: [noise] 

466.08 473.07 B: h- have it after we have a few under our belt we might stop and say hey you know that's not such a great idea [laughter] 

472.42 478.14 A: well i mean we've been televising trials for the last ten years and i don't think in in the large scheme of things 

478.37 484.69 A: they've really affected anything you know um i just think that in certain cases 

479.92 480.73 B: mhm 

484.62 497.89 A: you know it might have been a better idea to sequester the jury than to you know have gone on not sequestering them because you can trust that joe you know joe public is gonna go home and you know 

498.07 503.96 A: sit down at night and not watch the news and not pick up the paper because he's been told to do so by the judge 

503.50 504.08 B: (( mhm )) 

504.25 508.83 A: but you're probably gonna be wrong at least part of the time 

508.42 509.36 B: yeah 

509.21 510.76 A: you know ah 

511.20 517.71 A: you know because you can give juries instructions 'til you're blue in the face there's gonna be one guy who is gonna disregard them 

517.59 519.49 B: yep that's true 

518.44 519.55 A: so 

519.78 534.66 A: you know it it comes down to a matter of you know how i mean how how true to the original intention of the justice system do we want to be while still providing whatever you want to call it whether it's entertainment or information or whatever it may be 

534.23 535.59 B: mhm 

535.19 539.53 A: ah you know personally maybe they should just sell them on d._v._d. after they're done you know 

539.86 542.30 A: [laughter] you know 

540.91 545.70 B: [laughter] for those who would like to see the whole process i i think the whole pro- good 

542.99 552.72 A: sure why not you know and then and then who cares because it's already done nothing can be affected by it and you know you can make some money in the process [laughter] 

550.26 551.00 B: (( point )) 

552.19 554.38 B: yeah good ah good point though 

554.36 563.71 A: you know but i mean either way you know you just have to [noise] you just have to figure out which way would be best for you and you know i guess 

563.74 573.82 A: you know whichever it may be it just has to be fair to the person who is on trial because the basis of our system is you know innocent until proven guilty and l- 

568.42 569.30 B: right 

571.96 574.32 B: innocent until proven guilty mhm 

573.94 585.98 A: look at look at this look at this guy in california right now you know i'm not gonna say he's innocent i'm not going to say he's guilty either but as far as society is concerned ah he's guilty [noise] [noise] you know 

577.49 578.53 B: right 

584.26 585.72 B: right 

586.28 588.09 A: and you know 

588.54 597.07 A: i mean mentally i say yeah probably he is [noise] but you know morally i say we have no right to judge that you know 

596.93 597.90 B: (( yep )) 

597.27 599.95 A: and you know ultimately the court will decide
