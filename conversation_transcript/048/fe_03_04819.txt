0.90 2.63 A: hi this is pat 

1.15 2.22 B: (( hello )) 

2.77 4.27 B: hey this is mark 

4.07 5.43 A: hey mike how's it going 

5.20 6.24 B: uh mark 

6.87 8.03 B: um 

6.97 8.98 A: mark sorry 

8.04 10.16 B: so i guess our topic is smoking [laughter] 

10.32 12.36 A: yeah i guess uh 

11.03 11.82 B: um 

12.77 14.76 A: first up are you a smoker or non 

14.89 16.53 B: i'm a non smoker 

16.26 18.38 A: okay yeah same here so 

18.56 21.88 A: [laughter] so there's not that chance for the escalation of of 

21.16 22.98 B: [laughter] 

22.40 24.56 A: arguments that can pertain to this 

25.08 25.93 A: um 

26.05 27.66 B: yeah um 

28.32 31.61 B: mm well i guess i don't really 

32.29 46.81 B: i well i come from uh a state which always had um pretty lax regulations with smoking maryland but i've since moved to california and here 

41.25 42.14 A: okay 

46.52 47.94 A: (( mhm that's where i am too )) 

47.67 51.75 B: okay yeah they don't all- well yeah probably because of the uh time zone 

51.81 62.41 B: ah but basically uh yeah it was it was interesting to like experience bars and whatnot where actually there's a non smoking law so 

61.75 74.85 A: so yeah seriously i i moved out here from florida about six months ago and i just remember you know getting home from bars and my hair'd smell like smoke clothing would smell like smoke everything was just inundated and uh 

64.73 65.85 B: yeah 

70.53 71.52 B: yeah 

73.32 74.42 B: yeah 

75.61 78.13 A: and so it's definitely a a relief [laughter] 

78.23 79.09 B: yeah 

78.35 79.63 A: to be out here 

79.96 80.94 A: (( so )) 

81.13 85.13 A: although what's funny is just most places i see there's just this huge 

85.62 90.95 A: conglomeration of people right outside the front door smoking because they're they're [laughter] not allowed to inside 

88.92 94.30 B: yeah it also i think leads to sort of more um 

94.69 106.21 B: cliquishness like because people are separated into groups of you know friends who smoke and people who don't smoke people who are out like whether they're co workers or whatever 

95.91 96.75 A: yeah 

102.40 103.30 A: right 

106.00 111.17 B: like people tend to congregate who smoke and like leave out everyone who doesn't so 

111.51 117.56 B: i've noticed that dynamic more here more like separation between the two classes so to speak 

111.60 112.45 A: right 

118.43 121.17 A: yeah yeah i've noticed that too 'cause uh 

121.65 127.15 A: it's funny if i go outside because i'm interested in talking to somebody they assume i'm i'm i'm gonna smoke as well 

126.93 128.01 B: yeah 

127.42 128.37 A: so 

129.08 132.59 A: so i don't know how much it does for prevention then just because 

132.60 134.88 A: it seems to really 

135.62 140.72 A: you know encou- not yeah it actually does seem to encourage the behaviour of the people who already do 

140.96 147.33 A: in that okay now you go outside it becomes just part of the ritual it seems so it doesn't uh 

144.82 145.88 B: yeah 

147.51 148.50 A: (( i don't know )) 

147.60 152.65 B: well i think clearly the the main thing is just the health benefits for people who don't smoke at all 

151.89 154.61 A: yeah yeah that's that's really it 

153.68 160.27 B: so that's probably worth it i think it's to me it is strange to ban smoking 

160.34 172.99 B: outside in front of building i mean personally i'm not so irritated by cigarette smoke that you know like i it doesn't bother me to just walk by someone who's smoking outside 

170.60 172.25 A: (( so right same here )) 

172.85 174.10 A: it's trapped in 

173.03 175.70 B: so i feel like those rules are too extreme 

175.69 180.28 A: yeah unless we're talking about like you know the we're talking about doing it for outside of the uh 

181.14 186.42 A: like schoolyards especially elementary schools and whatnot and just uh keeping any 

183.79 185.17 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

186.85 189.40 A: any smoking away from there and i think then 

189.47 194.26 A: you know more so than even the health just kind of being of of seeing the habit of it 

194.06 208.70 A: and not 'cause i think kids are you know extraordinarily impressionable or anything like that but then again you know you see something as opposed to just not being exposed to it or or being given a message that it is not something to do 

209.07 217.58 A: then uh i think it'll lead them away from it i guess one other thing they were talking about was the whole you know like the the truth dot com ads i guess that uh 

218.02 220.33 A: i don't know if if you've seen on uh 

220.68 225.55 A: on t._v. like the one with the ice cream truck running along the fence outside the school 

225.78 229.63 B: oh no actually i don't really watch much t._v. so i haven't seen that 

227.68 234.78 A: okay neither neither do i but for some reason these these really stick in my head i don't know just 'cause of i guess what they're 

234.90 238.87 A: they're getting across they're really going after tobacco companies for their practices 

238.84 239.71 B: mhm 

239.00 240.05 A: um 

240.70 242.63 A: let's see 

243.58 246.43 A: no i'm not sure how this ban exactly fits into those 

246.72 254.34 A: so but in in a way i guess it would i mean because because the whole idea's just trying to shut bite on the fact that you know here's 

247.84 249.25 B: yeah so wh- 

254.96 258.38 A: the practise of these corporations to try and hook kids early 

258.71 259.81 A: or 

258.78 259.59 B: yeah 

259.94 262.49 A: you know just to try and target specific 

263.08 267.82 A: uh members of the population who might be having like a rougher time than 

267.98 269.85 A: than the rest of the population 

269.95 274.86 A: and market cigarettes to them [noise] that was just some of the things these ads go after 

272.84 273.65 B: so 

274.72 286.59 B: so do you think the the combination of of prohibiting smoking in public places and also having anti smoking ads do you think that will lead to 

287.29 300.01 B: you know eventual decline of smoking to a tiny minority or will it always be like a sizeable sub culture that will just sort of stay forever because people like to be rebellious or [laughter] like 

299.64 305.35 A: yeah i i don't even know if it's you know just rebellious as much as everybody needs some kind of release 

305.22 306.28 B: yeah 

305.76 313.72 A: and as long as smoking is one of them that's available it will be used i i think the only thing that will ever really cause the uh the problem is 

313.77 316.58 A: um is econ- is economic i 

316.68 322.25 A: mean i know people i hear people complain about three pack three bucks a pack for cigarettes four bucks a pack for cigarettes 

316.82 317.63 B: mhm 

321.54 322.93 B: yeah 

322.39 323.52 A: you know when 

323.60 327.06 A: if it ever starts to get up around like twenty bucks a pack for cigarettes 

325.68 326.90 B: [laughter] 

327.30 338.01 A: i think then we'll finally start to see some kind of drop off but as far as behavioral changes anything like that i've got an uncle who who was just you know treated chemotherapy radiative therapy for throat cancer 

338.15 344.73 A: he still smokes [laughter] if you know if if that's the only release that somebody has 

339.34 340.27 B: [laughter] 

344.80 350.58 A: you know it's it's just built in to to human nature to not want to give it up regardless of of that much of uh 

350.81 354.88 A: you know have it in to the hey hey this is going to kill you [laughter] you know 

354.29 355.95 B: yeah 

355.14 356.18 A: so 

357.36 359.67 B: so why is it that people don't have 

359.77 370.68 B: [mn] like why aren't there enough alternative releases that people have like why do people only why is there so much like concentration on this one incredibly harmful release when there could be other things 

370.42 371.10 A: (( so )) 

372.96 373.89 B: (( i don't know )) 

373.61 378.23 A: probably because of widespread damage in the in um 

378.77 385.19 A: in health facilities you know and and just well my in they're visible in health facilities i should say 

385.32 388.87 A: you know it's easy to go down a ward and see all the people with emphysema 

388.75 400.59 A: hooked up to ventilators et cetera et cetera okay they've been smoking all their lives i think it's just because it's very visible very easy to trace back and okay for instance okay marijuana's illegal 

394.64 395.46 B: yeah 

400.69 410.73 A: and i'm sure you know you're smoking something there it's gonna cause as much damage but it's it's not as prevalent because you know it's because it's still illegal it's a little bit hidden 

411.40 421.04 A: smoking's still legal you know so it's kinda right out there in the open so it's a target and i'm actually and i guess alcohol sorry 

417.57 425.29 B: so how do you how do you feel about drug legalization in general like versus versus further prohibition 

422.15 424.09 A: in general 

425.63 426.58 A: um 

427.69 433.41 A: i think what they're currently doing as far as the war on it is uh a real waste of our resources 

433.07 434.28 B: yeah 

433.88 434.99 A: um 

436.48 439.08 A: you know just looking at the population of 

439.10 442.16 A: prisons things along those lines people whose 

442.33 443.90 A: lives take a turn 

444.27 447.41 A: very sharp turn downwards after getting busted 

446.72 448.94 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

447.88 452.99 A: when there are many more violent crimes and crimes that actually involve another person 

452.60 453.61 B: yeah 

453.03 456.47 A: out there that that uh resources aren't available for 

456.35 457.73 B: yeah 

457.24 459.71 A: so you know i mean who's [sigh] 

460.24 464.07 A: okay granted you know you're you're wrecking your own life you gonna be a cost to the 

464.26 471.22 A: the health care industry later on but then smoking will do that going out and drinking excessively every night will do you know 

471.66 472.78 A: there's uh 

473.48 479.21 A: there's plenty of other things out there that are you really need to have no physical benefit [laughter] 

479.40 480.58 A: and um 

482.46 486.80 A: and i don't really see what's the government point to get their fingers into what you do with your own body 

486.33 487.62 B: (( [noise] mhm yeah )) 

487.05 487.98 A: um 

488.52 500.47 B: yeah i mean i think like the the present you know campaign on smoking is is pretty reasonable um and i think it could be duplicated for 

488.56 489.42 A: (( but )) 

500.73 503.11 B: other sorts of you know 

503.34 511.18 B: you know sometimes harmful habits like harder drugs i mean that's my personal opinion on that just that 

508.46 514.41 A: yeah when i look at what the what holland has done the netherlands 

513.29 515.02 B: mhm 

514.65 515.98 A: as far as 

516.34 523.36 A: you know as far as a lax attitude toward saying okay you can do what you want but we're gonna make you aware of all the consequences 

522.95 524.02 B: yeah 

523.47 536.94 A: and we're gonna have programs here if you get addicted and you know it's actually it's more cost effective and that's actually kind of where we are oddly enough with with smoking they say you know here it is 

525.55 527.85 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

536.97 538.53 A: you know it's bad for you 

539.28 546.90 A: and actually i don't even know how much they have as far as the i guess that's one another thing they they asked us to talk about was uh 

547.64 552.58 A: treatment and the ability to kind of break the addiction and what has been done 

551.00 552.34 B: mhm 

552.85 554.36 A: as far as 

554.61 555.41 A: (( you know )) 

555.52 563.94 A: are any of these efforts actually helping anybody to break the addiction and i guess i talked about my uncle and that's kind of specific but in in general 

564.51 570.59 A: i don't know it's strange i mean the trend seems to be that it goes up and down as it's as the years go by and they look at like say 

570.82 574.72 A: college age kids eighteen to twenty two and the percent of smokers among them 

574.92 577.59 A: and it hasn't really been like a steady decline 

577.69 580.16 B: yeah it's sort of oscillates like a trend 

579.57 581.50 A: yeah yeah 

580.38 582.98 B: and different drugs go in and out of fashion huh mm 

582.46 587.88 A: same yeah exactly same thing same same thing as alcohol so 

588.05 592.19 A: so i mean i don't know there it doesn't seem like they're really getting at any kind of underlying 

592.77 599.72 A: any underlying source there or any underlying reason for it it seems more of a a topical kind of uh
