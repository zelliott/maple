8.57 10.09 B: (( oh i'm from new york )) 

9.83 10.87 A: oh okay 

11.17 13.99 A: yeah so i guess we're supposed to be talking about terrorism a 

13.45 15.01 B: yeah i guess so huh 

15.02 16.58 A: a terrorist attack 

15.14 19.36 B: so what well when there's and then you react 

19.26 24.07 A: oh i thought i don't know i usually tend to be pretty calm ah 

23.34 29.18 B: (( yeah )) 

24.71 26.89 A: right yeah because ah 

26.94 31.54 A: i tend to react pretty ah logically in stressful situations 

31.66 33.36 B: right 

31.75 32.45 A: but 

32.58 37.90 A: i've had i've had a lot i've had some training in the army and i was in the airborne 

35.05 41.79 B: (( yeah )) 

38.78 40.35 A: i like to think of it i'd 

40.41 42.45 A: (( ah operate through all the stress )) 

42.89 46.69 A: ah how are ah but you were you in new york in nine eleven 

46.65 59.90 B: i was in new york in nine eleven and ah actually i was pretty i wasn't you know down town but i was you know we seen it you know and like i was calm considering what happened but had i been 

52.50 53.33 A: right 

59.73 68.44 B: right in the building or you know near by i don't know that i would have been calm 'cause seeing people's reactions and watching people around you you tend to 

68.43 77.29 B: you know you tend to follow with the crowd you know and just and blend in so i i don't know like like i said like normally like you said i agree with you a- in you know 

70.48 71.41 A: right 

77.37 86.29 B: ah under the gun situations i normally hold my composure pretty well but in something like that i don't know that i'd be able to ah 

82.13 83.15 A: (( mhm )) 

86.57 91.81 B: stay you know stay calm like some of the people did actually 

90.24 95.69 A: yeah well it's one of those things that you know you never really know because that's an incredible amount of stress 

95.55 98.15 B: right i mean hopefully we'll never find out [laughter] 

95.79 96.63 A: (( ah )) 

97.67 100.15 A: yeah yes i think so 

100.35 102.49 A: but it's ah 

103.14 108.62 A: i've had experiences where i was responsible for something like a 

108.63 111.44 A: a building of about about a 

111.96 120.16 A: about a hun- ninety thousand square feet and we had the fire alarms go off and i was responsible for evacuating and clearing it so 

119.65 120.89 B: wow 

120.75 122.98 A: yeah that was ah kind of weird 

123.01 126.35 B: right so you you so you're so you're trained that way i guess 

123.06 123.75 A: (( but )) 

126.11 129.77 A: right so that's that's my first reaction 

129.87 132.85 A: but i really think they that most people 

130.21 131.92 B: right 

132.96 139.12 A: ah don't have that training and i think it's something we really have to do in this country to get people more used to that sort of thing 

138.00 144.53 B: right and ah exactly and i think too especially now after nine eleven i think people in general are 

144.39 156.85 B: more prone to panic because they're so secured of you know all you hear about every day is something you know i mean on the news every day here we hear some type of suspected terrorism some place 

156.56 157.45 A: (( mhm )) 

156.84 160.44 B: you know whether it's a false alarm or not even like just over the week 

160.70 163.44 B: we we had the incident in time station 

162.88 165.30 A: (( mm )) 

163.52 177.40 B: in new york when they thought there was a briefcase and then they had the other incident at the airport and ah with the package outside time station so people here are even though you hear it they still seem to get you know pretty wound up over it pretty quick 

177.63 178.83 A: (( yeah because i think )) 

177.91 191.40 B: you know so i think it's true what you're saying and i think there should be some way to train people for this especially in the time when we were at war and everything else i think that we should definitely have training to make people understand what's going on and what they're supposed to do 

187.77 189.28 A: (( right i think that )) 

191.38 199.22 A: right because i when i was ah i spent when i was in the army i spent some time in the late eighties mid to late eighties in in europe 

199.54 206.09 A: and people who live in europe ah especially i was in great britain so they had a lot of i._r._a. terrorism there 

201.68 205.36 B: (( right )) 

205.96 210.89 B: (( right )) 

206.21 217.64 A: and they have a very good system where people got used to it they understood it it took them some time and um the example like they have in israel see 

218.03 226.50 A: ah it's going to take a long bit of time but it's got to start very early and it's just got to keep be enforced and ah i think something like a 

220.83 224.76 B: (( right right )) 

226.68 230.05 A: a programme in the schools would probably be good 

229.07 237.24 B: right i i i was just going to say that i think that's the best place to start is to teach the children but i mean myself i know just a month ago i was on a flight to florida 

237.11 237.94 A: uh-huh 

237.29 248.02 B: and one of the guys in the first seat he didn't take his insulin and before the plane took off they were asking everybody you know they were asking him if he was okay because he just had a horrible complexion color 

245.62 246.43 A: right 

248.01 256.54 B: and sure enough forty five minutes to an hour into the flight he started to you know have panic you know he started to not be able to ah 

256.49 260.26 B: you know really respond he wasn't responsive and stuff and sure enough 

260.12 263.34 B: we had to make an emergency landing and i tell you the truth 

263.28 268.75 B: people on the plane even though they knew that he was sick prior to him getting on the plane okay 

268.69 281.35 B: did not react well you know there were two nurses on board that were taking care of him giving him juice giving him stuff but like it was a weird situation 'cause he had nobody waiting for him at the airport he didn't really know who he was 

270.55 271.61 A: (( right )) 

274.72 275.49 A: uh-huh 

279.22 280.11 A: right 

281.34 293.39 B: and then he wanted to make a phone call and everybody on the plane that was sitting on it that were around him 'cause i was three rows behind him were telling including myself we were telling the stewardess you know look don't let this guy dial numbers 

293.45 295.50 B: (( you know this guy 'cause i didn't know who he is )) 

295.43 303.52 B: you know who knows if there's a bomb in the plane that he's going to dial numbers and this plane's going to explode and i didn't think if you're taking this plane down you use whatever phone you need to use 

303.52 314.33 B: to get medical emergencies to the ground you know so that when he lands he's okay don't get me wrong i'm not asking you to jeopardize his safety but dialing anybody from his phone at thirty eight thousand feet in the air 

305.51 306.34 A: (( mhm )) 

314.34 324.95 B: isn't going to help him at all you know and people were panicking and people were starting to say it's true you don't know what he could have swallowed maybe who knows in today's tr- you know today's day and age you don't know what they did 

315.66 316.70 A: (( you're right )) 

324.66 325.46 A: yeah 

324.89 329.36 B: you know these people who knows you know and he wasn't you know he wasn't an american 

326.83 327.69 A: (( yeah it )) 

329.39 330.25 A: (( mhm )) 

329.55 337.36 B: and the people were panicking so i definitely believe that the majority of people i agree with you i think the majority of people in today's times 

331.56 332.51 A: oh okay 

337.17 347.64 B: after nine eleven i believe would panic first would not really know what to do or how to react and can actually cause more harm than good because there were people starting to panic on the plane 

347.90 357.61 A: yeah 'cause ah it's kind of it's kind of interesting because i haven't actually had a situation like that but i have seen ah people panic on a lot of the simple things 

357.46 369.12 A: i think ah the easy they reason the people panic is because they feel they have no control and that's all that the training is is like okay i'm doing the best that i can that's really what i think 

360.01 362.23 B: (( right )) 

363.03 366.41 B: right right 

367.92 382.51 B: and also i think too one thing i think that where we we we're not seeing either is i really don't believe i think what you said first is true people don't know what the right thing to do at that moment is and i think that's what people get scared at 'cause i know even on the plane myself 

378.19 379.04 A: (( they mhm )) 

382.50 388.89 B: i felt trapped i didn't know what to do i'm not in the medical field so i didn't really know what medical attention 

388.70 400.99 B: to give him at the same token when things were done i didn't know you know what do you do you know you're calling when you're on the ground well you think you can do this you can do that you can call here you can go there you know you're stranded in mid air 

389.88 390.75 A: right 

401.16 402.48 A: right 

401.17 405.12 B: what do you do and i i think that is in itself 

405.21 408.36 B: i think is where the training needs to be done i think we need to 

408.33 420.61 B: realise what services are available to what emergency services are available how to get to them what's the best thing to do what's the best way to react at that time 'cause like you said you're never going to know what to do 

417.12 417.96 A: uh-huh 

420.47 427.84 B: or how you're going to react in a situation until it happens but by the same token you would know what to do when it happens 

427.45 428.33 A: (( yes )) 

428.48 436.82 A: and the thing is is that what the idea about people getting prepared for a terrorist ah or some sort of big piece of stress like that 

433.49 444.04 B: (( right )) 

436.85 444.35 A: is that you can train for a generality and then when something happens 

444.47 456.10 A: such a a a specific incident happens you can just fall back on that training even though it really doesn't have anything to do with what happened ah my example would be is when i went to college i went to a military academy 

456.23 466.72 A: and so they put us under a lot of stress which is really bogus stress but the fact is that you had people yelling at you and you had they had you make trying to do three things at once running around like a chicken with your head cut off 

465.45 468.66 B: (( right )) 

466.92 471.88 A: but the fact is is that when the all i had to do is that because i had that 

471.90 475.14 A: ah training i had that experience but 

473.42 475.87 B: (( right )) 

475.05 488.48 A: when i was an adult whenever there was something that was stressful i could always pull back and just say okay well i just cut through all this chatter and think quietly to myself and then that's what that's what people have to do it's 

488.35 494.62 A: people are i think part of our society is just two used to having everything nice and clean 

494.98 496.20 B: (( i )) 

495.31 499.36 A: yeah so we have to dirty things up and it sounds really cruel 

497.97 501.40 B: mean see like i said i mean you know you real- [noise] 

503.42 504.27 A: pardon 

505.54 507.31 A: (( ah i must have lost you )) 

507.18 508.47 B: happen in 

512.52 519.44 A: okay i i can't really hear you right now can you try saying that again because ah you might have lost contact on ah your phone 

522.60 523.37 A: (( [pause] oh )) 

523.86 528.89 A: well hopefully you can ah hear me and we can continue this test 

529.12 529.88 A: but 

529.89 532.85 A: failing that i'll just sit here and wait till 

534.66 540.53 A: (( mm )) 

544.08 545.23 A: (( interesting i )) 

545.92 547.98 A: wonder if this call's being monitored or 

546.16 547.52 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

561.65 562.96 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

562.91 564.39 A: (( [mn] well that's a signal )) 

565.70 566.58 A: (( [pause] hello [pause] )) 

567.96 570.62 A: (( mm )) 

571.40 572.93 A: well completed test 

573.05 576.35 A: so hopefully i can try do this again ah 

577.00 582.64 A: the ah hopefully somebody will be listening to this i don't know what to do at this point ah 

582.67 584.75 A: much like the terrorism thing 

585.03 587.74 A: so i'm going to hang up and hopefully this 

587.78 592.63 A: they can find you know validate this result and try another result later thank you
