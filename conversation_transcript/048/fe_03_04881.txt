335.51 345.81 B: forensic detectives and forensic files and things like that and how they solve murders and yeah to me that's just that's awesome i'd i'd love to do that 

335.90 337.87 A: (( we do oh )) 

347.41 351.20 B: but there's no not much call for forensics for nurses 

351.25 357.68 B: even though there is a masters program i found out the other day about it [noise] but ah i don't want to go back to school right now

383.97 385.01 A: (( they don't )) 

385.26 394.76 B: um i'm sure it's a lot more boring and and tedious and time consuming than they let on on t._v. i mean i'm not stupid enough to assume it's not 

385.45 387.46 A: (( they don't )) 

390.76 392.23 A: (( show you )) 

392.40 394.73 A: i would imagine i

395.61 397.01 B: yeah 

398.17 400.17 B: [sigh] oh i would think so 

398.98 403.91 A: because you're documenting everything and ah i imagine you'd 

400.24 403.13 B: mhm 

404.08 417.25 A: what they show on t._v. they don't show a guy filling out ten million forms [laughter] they just show oh i found it i got the answer and you can go straight to the trial or whatever skip all the stuff in between [laughter] 

407.16 410.45 B: exactly yeah 

413.48 414.84 B: (( uh-huh )) 

416.96 423.45 B: well see what they you know some of the things they'll they'll have a hair or something that they've been holding in evidence for years 

417.40 419.17 A: (( they got the )) 

423.44 436.72 B: and then all of a sudden you know they link it to somebody but you know what what i wonder is you know did they work on that case for two years and have all of these dead ends and it's ah 

426.87 430.06 A: (( yeah )) 

435.53 436.24 A: (( uh )) 

436.79 441.78 B: you know that i i don't know if i could do that you know i mean i guess it's 

440.76 443.53 A: i'm i'm sure they yeah they work on 

443.59 445.64 A: they probably work on 

446.55 448.83 A: a bunch of cases at one time 

448.22 450.88 B: yeah yeah 

449.23 455.98 A: and whichever one gets and then they go 'til it's a dead end and then they well let's work on another one for a while 

454.88 456.58 B: yeah 

456.19 456.75 A: [cough] 

456.93 458.07 A: and then ah 

459.34 461.26 A: so i'm sure there's a lot of dead ends 

461.04 469.22 B: yep i'm sure there's a lot of frustration to go with the gratification if you do actually nail the the culprit so 

468.87 472.24 A: well i i think the aggravating thing would be if it's 

472.67 478.68 A: if you know that the person did it and they get off [laughter] you'd just kinda go oh man 

475.41 477.96 B: [noise] yeah yeah 

479.06 479.84 B: (( yep )) 

480.26 484.31 A: (( you know see how they get off on a technicality or something you just kinda go )) 

480.44 482.46 B: all that work for nothing 

482.51 484.22 B: (( and uh-huh [noise] )) 

484.46 485.61 A: oh man 

485.28 486.72 B: uh-huh
