0.00 1.10 A: hello 

0.52 1.69 B: hello 

1.41 2.33 A: hi 

2.13 4.75 B: hi um i'm sandra 

4.42 6.62 A: hi sandra i'm fazon 

7.34 11.02 A: um so um this is the first one i've done 

10.79 14.28 B: same here so i have no idea what to expect 

11.46 13.17 A: okay [laughter] 

14.03 20.97 A: uh yeah so i guess we're supposed to talk about whether or not we think uh high profile trials should be on t._v. 

20.70 24.86 B: yeah i don't really care either way although they annoy me 

25.05 26.09 A: yeah 

25.98 26.57 B: (( yeah )) 

26.67 28.29 B: i don't know how you feel 

27.21 29.10 A: what is that annoys you about it 

29.04 31.74 B: i guess the o._j. trial is an example i just 

32.34 36.84 B: i don't i can't even explain why it annoyed me maybe it's just the 

37.15 41.47 B: the way it goes on and on and th- they wouldn't put anybody else on 

41.80 43.67 B: t._v. if it wasn't 

43.71 45.92 B: somebody that was that reputation 

45.70 49.18 A: right that's right yeah and um 

49.30 52.67 A: i guess for me i don't i you know it has to do with 

52.67 60.21 A: uh the fact that really there's not much to say either you know and there's you know i i don't even mind i don't think the trial 

60.10 70.23 A: so much but the speculation that goes along with it and all the commentary and the second guessing when there's really you know in some ways there's a lot not a lot that's going on 

69.78 75.52 B: yeah and then it comes on and if you watch the news later oh and on the this trial today the whole and 

75.28 76.37 A: that's right 

75.70 77.26 B: (( i'm just enough already )) 

77.07 78.27 A: that's right 

77.76 83.96 B: although i didn't mind when they had some of the court proceedings during the election on t._v. 

84.03 86.10 A: during the wha- oh during the election 

85.61 86.80 B: yeah the one 

87.42 90.66 B: the whole gore bush thing that whole mass 

89.23 90.19 A: right 

90.23 91.11 A: right 

91.54 97.24 A: but even then i think you know i guess it's just that i never really feel like i have uh all the information 

97.55 101.67 A: and so that's always you know you know like the gore bush 

101.90 116.40 A: uh uh confusion in terms of uh what was happening in florida and all the other the other things that were happening in terms of uh uh what was the the electoral process and what was going on in the precincts and 

104.10 105.45 B: (( mhm )) 

116.63 118.12 A: (( and um )) 

118.56 127.67 A: you know i never really felt like you know like we were getting the whole story i mean and so maybe it's not even just the trial but it's the media itself for me that 

126.92 127.85 B: yeah 

127.83 130.74 A: you know you're it's always very suspect 

131.62 132.59 B: that's true 

133.99 137.74 B: because you can never really trust them to do objective reporting and also 

137.78 141.07 B: what's objective in who's eyes and subjective in others 

140.56 141.35 A: yeah 

141.18 150.21 B: i'm usually a little bit more clear i don't know why i'm not making any sense either i'm cooking some pasta and i haven't eaten even though it's late just come home from work 

144.44 145.31 A: (( that's right uh-huh )) 

150.23 153.16 B: so [laughter] that's probably why 

150.70 156.65 A: [laughter] yeah well i yeah i mean i don't think it really matters so much 

157.00 161.10 A: um whether or not we're gonna solve this or answer it you know once and for all 

161.40 166.51 B: i guess they're just looking for little words you use when you speak or just linguistic traits or 

166.24 167.38 A: yeah 

169.08 173.04 A: yeah are you now are you in uh um what part of the country are you in 

172.88 174.76 B: i'm in st paul 

174.58 177.65 A: you're in s- oh okay um yeah i'm in california 

175.47 176.48 B: mhm 

177.88 179.20 A: los angeles 

178.78 180.84 B: oh that's cool i used to live in oakland 

179.54 180.37 A: yeah 

180.62 181.52 A: (( did you )) 

181.16 182.40 B: mhm 

181.59 183.88 A: yeah i used to live in san raphael 

183.65 185.43 B: oh not too far from there 

184.91 188.36 A: that's right yeah that now san 

186.02 186.80 B: yeah 

187.67 189.94 B: then no wonder we talk about the o._j. trial 

189.51 191.34 A: (( [laughter] that's right )) 

190.36 191.83 B: (( [laughter] the )) 

191.70 192.39 A: (( uh-huh )) 

192.46 207.44 A: in in in fact you know i i uh was i have just come back from a business trip and uh stepped off the plane and looked you know as i'm walking through the through the airport everybody is gathered around this t._v. 

207.51 208.89 A: and uh 

209.43 214.44 A: you know there is the the slo- the infamous slow speed chase 

214.19 215.35 B: mhm 

214.64 221.83 A: uh and uh just and you know everybody was just tuned into it it was just such a surreal scene 

217.75 218.33 B: (( mm )) 

221.99 228.34 A: and uh you know finally made it home and it was just still going on and it was crazy it was crazy 

229.51 234.61 B: well what about the fact that the supreme court doesn't let cameras in unless i've got that wrong 

234.97 239.08 A: yeah i no i think you're right although they they do have reporters who 

239.17 246.64 A: um are there and you know if they are allowed to you know summarize the process of the trial and um 

246.87 252.14 B: but is there any reason to believe that having the t._v. cameras compromises the judicial process 

252.50 255.22 B: i don't know what your opinion would be on that 

254.53 257.72 A: mhm well i mean i think it's a it's uh 

258.34 269.73 A: i don't th- yeah i don't think it's the i don't think it's the t._v. cameras i really don't um and especially in in a situation like just the supreme you know supreme court case 

269.48 271.02 B: mhm 

269.93 270.86 A: um 

270.92 273.58 A: because i think all the 

272.89 273.45 B: (( mm )) 

273.78 276.86 A: (( all of our principles are um )) 

277.47 290.33 A: so focused as opposed to some trial where uh it is a jury of peers and and you know people who do not really um have to testify or make argument for a living 

290.31 295.15 A: um you know the witnesses and all that who might be um 

295.40 301.51 A: you know who might be more influenced by t._v. cameras okay probably it's less 

301.61 306.07 A: um you know in in the case of the supreme court 

309.72 313.35 A: um i mean i don't think people would uh necessarily be 

313.55 316.46 A: i don't think they'd be show boating any more 

316.63 320.94 A: than you know they you know than they would because they're making a you 

320.92 333.41 A: know most of them are conscious about making ultimately making policy or or at least making decisions that will affect policy whether there are cameras there or not they don't need it it doesn't matter if they're seen or not 

333.25 346.83 B: that's true one other thing is that some judges get elected other ones get appointed and i wonder if you watch them on t._v. enough times whether it'll change how you vote for them and make you even care in a local election what judge gets in office 

338.10 339.06 A: right 

345.25 346.09 A: right 

346.59 358.07 A: right and that's a now actually that's a very good um it's a very good point and you know and interestingly enough that's you know they do have cameras in those court rooms so 

358.32 362.41 A: you know maybe they could make a deal with a with a network 

363.36 367.83 B: yeah because i only remember watching court trials on uh cable on like cspan 

366.58 369.60 A: right like court t._v. or cspan yeah 

369.05 370.25 B: mhm 

371.13 373.72 B: which i unfortunately don't have any more [laughter] 

373.13 377.50 A: [laughter] i don't i don't either no cable 

377.18 377.90 B: no 

378.25 379.58 A: but um 

379.75 384.18 A: yeah so it's you know it's uh but an- and i guess the other thing is you know 

384.60 390.70 A: um you know for me you know it's not something i would tend to watch 

390.95 394.81 A: even if it were on i think you know but it's hard because 

393.47 395.58 B: i don't even watch the judge judy 

395.33 399.30 A: right [laughter] yeah i know i don't i don't either um 

399.09 404.39 B: was a cute quote on the simpsons i didn't watch the simpsons either but heard about it 

404.48 409.68 B: and how can you be judge judy and executioner instead of judge jury and executioner 

409.08 410.97 A: yes yeah that's funny 

410.70 411.53 B: yeah 

414.42 416.55 B: i've no idea when this ten minutes is up 

415.99 418.05 A: [laughter] 

417.14 420.02 B: [laughter] because we're supposed to stay on topic 

419.48 425.57 A: yeah well yeah like well i don't know if it has to be on topic but ah 'cause how's your pasta doing 

426.06 427.54 A: or whatever you're doing 

426.14 429.00 B: oh it's doing okay it'll be done by a few minutes 

429.07 430.66 A: [laughter] but um 

431.65 434.32 A: yeah no i haven't actually uh 

434.75 436.65 A: um watched uh 

436.66 440.26 A: any of those court shows and what's the other 

442.42 445.14 A: um i mean i guess those are not 

447.47 451.99 A: um you know i'm not i'm not sure what it is that that is the attraction um 

452.57 458.53 A: you know what it is that people are actually watching when they when they watch it you know is it um 

459.23 461.55 A: you know is it some sort of uh 

461.88 466.54 B: to see if a high profile person would get the same treatment as anyone else maybe 

465.63 470.94 A: well yeah yeah or you know it's some sort of uh vicarious 

471.09 474.66 A: um need that's getting felt you know 

477.35 486.41 A: um and maybe it is maybe it's just to see in fact if they're gonna you know if they're going to it's a li- you know it is reality t._v. it's a live soap opera 

486.12 487.10 B: yeah 

486.49 488.27 A: (( that people can just follow )) 

489.03 489.91 B: that's true 

492.52 500.19 B: yeah it gets old after a while i did watch snippets of the o._j. thing and i got bored but also they because they put it on t._v. later too 

500.03 501.20 A: right 

500.54 502.11 B: so you couldn't escape it 

502.08 505.08 A: right well i mean you know as you as you 

505.19 512.63 A: may recall um they they just that's that's what the program programming is often you don't have too much of a choice 

515.34 517.10 A: (( you know and uh that as well as uh you know uh )) 

519.39 524.74 A: you remember some of the proceedings for clinton's impeachment and 

524.81 526.88 A: and uh even way back when 

529.04 530.99 A: (( some of the um other uh )) 

531.03 534.32 A: what was that um clemence thomas 

533.23 536.84 B: mhm oh yeah the the coke bottle 

536.42 545.61 A: [laughter] okay yeah oh my god [laughter] oh my god that's you know i had not remembered that detail but that's just so true yeah 

537.12 538.63 B: and the hair 

538.97 539.93 B: yes 

543.88 552.46 B: [laughter] i have a really fu- funny memory i still haven't gotten that one out of my head it was supposed to be a pubic hair on a coke can 

551.18 553.38 A: that's i know that was 

552.70 554.29 B: [laughter] 

553.67 557.68 A: that was just so so vile i tell you 

557.30 559.93 B: the the whole thing was pretty vile the 

559.28 568.91 A: but uh and i i believed every single i believed it was true i believe that you know i i believe that's what the guy was all about 

568.34 572.20 B: he probably was i mean he's sitting up there and he doesn't do very much 

571.87 573.87 A: he doesn't no he's uh 

573.48 577.51 B: maybe that's the reason supreme courts are afraid to let cameras in 

577.81 578.75 A: yeah 

577.98 578.82 B: and a 

580.80 582.84 A: well yeah 'cause they don't do that much yeah 

582.47 590.76 B: we well no well some of them do that much but also then then you might be able to prove that they have selected the presidential [laughter] outcome instead of 

590.43 591.76 A: right 

591.26 594.25 B: 'cause uh that whole thing was just wish to wishy washy 

593.82 599.95 A: yeah that's true that's really true i mean that was the other i was thinking about um as well
