0.49 1.84 A: hello 

1.33 4.83 B: hello my name is ah my name is richard 

2.66 3.65 A: hi 

4.82 7.02 A: richard hi my name's gerry how're you doing 

6.45 17.90 B: all right i'm very good ah [laughter] i'm very glad to talk to you okay ah okay today's topic is of course i ah the how do you think most people would would react during a terrorist attack 

9.88 11.17 A: (( nice talking )) 

17.82 18.92 A: right 

18.30 20.73 B: okay how do you think most people would react 

20.91 26.61 A: well i don't know i'm kind of i've probably got kind of a biased opinion on it because i was in the marine corp for twelve years 

26.19 27.24 B: (( okay mhm )) 

26.96 37.10 A: and ah so normally the people you know most of the people that i'm surrounded by are probably not going to panic as much i would think you know that would be my first opinion because of 

37.39 43.74 A: of being you know being in the military state of mind and it's it's a heightened state of awareness for them to begin with so 

44.81 49.54 A: i think most people probably i don't know as far as overall though 

50.48 55.94 A: i think a lot of people whenever they're presented with it face to face will probably panic though you know 

54.94 55.87 B: well 

55.89 59.48 B: i i guess i i guess i concur 

59.82 66.61 B: partially it's because i think of course your being in the military sort of makes you ready 

66.65 71.26 B: ah it least predisposes you to deal with adversity ah 

70.45 71.44 A: right 

71.44 84.95 B: and ah and most and most civilians and most of the civilian population i was in the military but i was only in for three years but ah i do know that most of the ci- ah i i believe that most of the ah civilian population 

79.61 80.45 A: mhm 

85.56 95.71 B: would panic because they're not tr- well first of all america has been very very fortunate ah we have not this is the first time we've been exposed to 

91.07 92.05 A: mhm 

95.62 101.37 B: attack by terrorists or a r- a real attack since ah pearl harbour on our own 

100.30 102.97 A: right on our o- yeah on our home soil 

101.43 113.24 B: on our yeah on our own soil and now we know how the rest of the world lives and and i think it's a very hard pill for us to swallow but in order for 

104.03 105.04 A: yeah and 

107.74 108.91 A: yeah 

113.53 115.42 B: reaction although 

115.82 121.33 B: i don't know i think people can be resourceful i think once they got over the initial shock 

118.92 119.92 A: mhm 

120.65 132.26 A: shock of it right because see i'm i'm i'm i'm a paramedic and like well i'm now and i'm going through ah using my g._i. bill to pay for college as a matter of fact i'll be going back to ah get my degree as a paramedic 

121.66 123.21 B: yeah because 

131.88 132.87 B: okay 

132.32 138.47 A: so i i deal with you know i deal with adversity every day you know everything every every time that i go you know 

138.26 139.22 B: yeah 

138.37 153.05 A: on a call or something it's you know it's new but if i would have been i guarantee you if i would have been standing you know down there by the world trade centre when when one of them planes flew into it i wouldn't have been ready for it you know i mean even with all the training i've got i would have looked up and went holy shit [laughter] you know 

151.28 152.94 B: (( yeah [laughter] i i know exact- )) 

152.89 154.76 A: [laughter] but i 

153.30 154.80 B: [laughter] i know exact 

154.77 161.75 A: acted like you said after the initial shock you know i would have ah you know my stuff would have kicked in and i would have been on top of what i was doing you know 

161.34 168.86 B: mhm because i've noticed well i noticed right after the world trade centre right after the ah the attack the ah the crash 

168.72 169.62 A: mhm 

168.91 175.43 B: ah the collision that what happened was that people kind of pulled together they just did and ah 

173.29 174.18 A: right 

175.84 186.68 B: if there were any good thing any good thing that could've could've come out of that horrible incident i think we just broke out of that ah temporary isolation by which we insulate ourselves 

186.58 187.51 A: right 

186.88 196.73 B: and we just decided you know to just give a hand because i don't think i knew anyone who was not in sympathy or wanting to do something i mean what you could do 

189.92 190.90 A: mhm 

195.13 196.26 A: exactly 

196.72 208.10 B: ah it might have been frustrat- it might have been frustrating trying to figure out what you could do but people wanted to so and i think ah i think the ah survival instinct is also a very healthy instinct 

200.92 201.95 A: right 

202.48 203.34 A: yeah 

208.09 214.89 B: and i think that under a terrorist attack once we got over the initial shock we would certainly 

215.19 216.40 B: just pitch in 

216.56 221.37 A: exactly and you know and it's like any community or or neighbourhood or whatever 

221.23 231.99 A: ah you know some more than others obviously because of the resources i think mostly but you know everybody's going to pitch in to help the neighbour and and even when it's on a grander scale like it was there in new york city you know 

231.87 234.33 A: everybody did what they could and and 

234.32 248.82 A: you know and also people you know there was also tension there all the time down there like they had the the confrontations between the police and the fire department at you know during the rescue efforts and all and that was more frustration i think than it was panic it was just you know people's people's 

248.68 252.88 A: getting their nerves worn down and and getting in you know getting short with each other 

252.64 263.73 B: mhm well i remember back and um now this goes way back this was about in nineteen ah sixty five ah sixty f- ah yeah it was sixty five when 

263.67 269.24 B: when when the lights went out ah when the power was shut off on the east coast 

267.49 270.30 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

269.26 272.02 B: (( ah w- what happened was ah )) 

272.40 274.70 B: i remember i was stuck in the subway 

274.88 275.90 A: oh really 

274.98 277.39 B: (( and uh-huh and ah )) 

277.44 285.93 B: and there was no panic i mean we just we knew that we were in trouble but folks didn't panic you know we were worried apprehensive 

283.96 284.86 A: mhm 

285.73 297.73 B: there was no denying that but people did i mean [laughter] people didn't start shoving or pushing or screaming or yelling we just sort of waited and sort of consoled each other just assured each other that you know things were going to work out 

285.83 286.68 A: right 

291.87 292.75 A: mhm 

297.66 308.21 A: yeah well i think i think looking at things like they had those two ah the night the nightclub incidents that they had where people were trampled to death and whatnot because you know 

298.59 299.77 B: (( and )) 

306.42 308.87 B: (( oh yeah mhm )) 

308.27 314.86 A: yeah and that's a that's a a a case right there where you think okay if i would have been in the nightclub a couple of hundred people 

314.83 326.19 A: and a fire broke out that there would be a reasonable amount of time you'd have to get out you know just just logically thinking but you know how many people are there ah you know there was those people there made it out not very many [laughter] you know 

318.59 319.59 B: mhm 

320.93 321.69 B: (( mm )) 

325.11 329.84 B: no no no that no well that that was that was horrible and um 

328.47 329.50 A: yeah 

329.98 332.02 B: but in that case 

332.15 341.87 B: well i think at well just sheer well see once again ah sheer panic well once once panic takes over it's very hard to control 

337.73 338.83 A: mhm 

341.86 342.66 A: right 

341.97 346.74 B: see one thing about emotions and this is something i'll quite often 

346.66 357.17 B: have heated discussions with friends about that emotions are not ra- are not necessarily rational and just seeing the fire the whole idea was just to get away 

349.05 350.01 A: (( oh yeah )) 

352.87 353.75 A: right 

357.04 358.32 A: mhm 

357.69 360.54 B: (( and that the the )) 

358.63 359.41 A: (( but even )) 

359.73 362.86 A: you know that wasn't a terrorist attack but still you know 

362.35 367.88 B: yeah but i mean well that's the whole idea of behind the it's the ah the terrorist attack ah 

368.21 378.08 B: ah i couple that with this new disease sars that's been ah contagious that's ah been been spreading ah throughout europe i mean ah asia asia 

375.91 378.61 A: mhm asia right 

378.26 383.70 B: and ah but you know the whole idea is so that once the news got out ah 

379.95 381.43 A: (( [noise] )) 

384.19 387.61 B: remember when they said that ah otta- what was it ah 

387.67 388.96 B: was it ottawa 

389.21 393.97 B: um the canadian city um ah 

392.36 394.62 A: uh-huh yeah i think it was ottawa 

394.28 398.98 B: uh-huh that the ah that the city no it wasn't it was it was montreal wasn't it 

398.90 399.86 A: okay 

399.42 401.03 B: okay but you know 

400.12 403.74 A: well they they had advance like cases in different most cities so 

402.45 414.39 B: yeah you're right and but they talking about it and they were saying you know you could just see the panic don't go to canada and canada's a big country i mean and the cases are so rare but that's once again 

409.24 410.29 A: oh yeah 

411.03 411.95 A: (( [laughter] )) 

414.52 422.13 B: when people believe themselves in danger and they're not used to facing adversity they often do irrational things 

414.98 416.16 A: right 

422.08 423.32 A: mhm 

422.71 436.53 B: however during a terrorist attack i think i think one of the problems that we're facing now is that there's a possibility that we would ah may not truly react until it was too late because we're being hyped all the time you know 

436.28 445.97 A: that's true too and and you know it's just that ah when you're finally faced with it 'cause you know all the the macho marine corp attitudes that that that i have you know around me a lot it's 

437.19 437.95 B: mhm 

445.95 460.80 A: you know well if i would have been on that plane or something like that you know well you don't know i mean 'cause you weren't there you know so you don't know if these people were panicking or if they were reacting calmly or whatever but you know it's just it's scary just to think that you'd have to be you know f- face to face with it but 

460.72 468.72 A: i know that i i i would react in at least a pos- some positive way if there was if there was a positive way to react you know if i was faced with it but 

469.48 470.36 B: well 

469.54 472.95 A: it's you know it's a scary reality that we have to deal with now 

472.63 482.43 B: yeah well once again any in in any situation where i feel i don't have control i have i you know i experience anxiety 

482.10 483.42 A: exactly 

482.72 495.24 B: so that's why i think ah fighting is almost instinctive because [laughter] i know that whatever's going to happen you know during a fight whatever happens to me i'm sure going to get a piece of you [laughter] if i get a chance ah 

493.74 496.08 A: exactly exactly 

495.29 497.91 B: (( [laughter] i mean um )) 

496.87 502.34 A: my own my own philosophy was you know you might you might whoop me but you're going to know you was in a fight 

501.73 507.32 B: [laughter] thank you exactly and i guess that's the whole thing ah another 

502.72 505.18 A: (( you know [laughter] so )) 

508.30 522.66 B: ah perplexing thing about the terrorist ah the possibility of a terrorist attack is that you don't know your enemy i mean you don't it's it's face- he's faceless he's an unknown as as as opposed to world war two where 

522.44 525.28 B: you knew the nazi's were the bad guys 

524.98 526.78 A: right we knew what we were up against 

525.39 539.91 B: you yeah you knew the asian imperial were in this case the japanese were the bad guys so r- so you you you're enemy had a face but but with this new with this with this new terrorist with this terrorist 

528.13 528.79 A: (( [cough] )) 

530.98 532.16 A: mhm 

535.27 536.67 A: right 

540.37 549.52 B: going on now it's faceless because you really don't it's something it's an there are so many issues that you just haven't even confronted much less understand 

549.00 550.66 A: oh yeah it's 

549.67 552.81 B: and so you know like why are they doing this ah 

552.88 553.82 A: yeah 

552.99 556.68 B: and so a- so your response is somewhat muddled 

557.07 560.89 A: that's the scariest part of it like you said it's just not knowing you know 

559.92 560.82 B: (( mhm )) 

561.07 565.45 A: who or where it's coming from to begin with and then you know and then not even you know 

563.93 564.93 B: oh w- 

565.03 568.57 B: yeah and w- why are you doing this to us yeah 

566.09 566.89 A: sh 

567.91 572.01 A: yeah and it's nuts you know and americans have always been such you know 

572.10 580.43 A: such a a proud people that that whenever they're confronted with some kind of chicken chicken shit is what i like to call it tactics you know the terrorist stuff 

578.08 578.98 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

580.48 590.40 A: you know they're like but hey you know but when it's whenever you don't you know you don't honor the believes and and values that we grew up with then you throw all the rules out the window 'cause you can do whatever you want you know 

589.94 591.40 B: uh-huh that's true 

591.35 599.89 A: it's just you know it's just like the the lions eating you know their young if they take over a pride or something you know they kill the other babies or whatever just like a
