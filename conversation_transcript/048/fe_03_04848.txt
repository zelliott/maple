13.68 21.21 A: this yeah actually this is my third i did two yesterday and then this one they've they've been c- calling pretty much non stop i guess 

21.14 24.89 B: well you're the pro then [laughter] 

22.83 25.69 A: oh i guess i guess so where are you from 

25.87 27.64 B: um california

30.80 32.90 B: oh it no northern california 

32.79 42.66 A: oh okay ah 'cause every everyone i've talked to so far has been in california but those the other two guys were both in l._a. so i thought it was maybe just local people they were hooking up with 

42.87 47.25 A: so um yeah i guess we're supposed to talk about ah the topic terrorism 

46.80 48.01 B: terrorism 

47.89 53.57 A: um and well i didn't really understand the question on the recording what did it say something 

52.94 58.76 B: do you think most people would remain calm or panic during a terrorist attack 

58.89 61.62 B: and how do you think you would react 

61.88 69.44 A: um do i think most people would remain well it depends you know a terrorist attack it depends on what kind of terrorist attack you're talking about um 

69.61 74.52 A: you now ah i think most people would probably panic 

74.74 81.85 A: you know if it's something if it's the type of attack where it's like you know people are dying then yeah i think most people would panic 

75.45 76.55 B: mhm 

81.91 83.42 A: i think i would 

83.06 88.12 B: i'm pretty sure i would [laughter] at least at least during the initial attack 

87.86 92.14 A: yeah ah yeah i mean they say most people i mean i'm su- there are certain people i'm sure that you know 

89.13 89.83 B: (( [mn] )) 

92.13 103.67 A: you know people who are cops or you know who have been trained in like emergency preparedness and things like that i'm sure they'll remain calm but ah i don't think i don't think i'd be all that calm 

103.58 111.68 A: if ah you know in the midst of ah an attack um were you were you here for the the quake in ninety four oh that's right you're up in northern california 

112.09 114.32 A: ah have you been in a major earthquake 

112.94 116.15 B: but i was i was down i lived down there in um 

117.17 119.23 B: seventy one when the 

119.36 124.03 B: cedar sinai hospital fell and it was a pretty big quake 

122.57 123.69 A: oh wow 

124.41 125.82 A: yeah um 

124.93 126.65 B: and i definitely panicked 

126.62 133.95 A: yeah i was i was here for the ah ninety four north ridge quake and ah i i panicked for that too so 

130.65 131.67 B: oh uh-huh 

133.72 135.74 B: actually we were there in ninety four 

133.99 134.88 A: um 

136.06 139.39 A: oh you were yeah so where were you what part of town 

136.85 137.98 B: mhm 

139.08 140.86 B: we we lived in riverside 

141.16 144.66 A: riverside okay i was in sherman oaks so ah 

142.13 143.30 B: mhm 

143.64 144.59 B: uh-huh 

144.80 146.67 A: got hit pretty hard um 

146.78 148.87 A: so i mean it's sort of the same thing 

149.25 157.27 B: yeah i would think it's the same thing because um we're just so i mean f- for one thing w- we're not expecting anything like that 

157.30 158.96 A: yeah 

157.91 161.81 B: and i i just think back to the nine eleven terrorist attack 

161.98 165.82 B: and i was i mean i was crying like i was there 

165.87 166.81 A: yeah 

166.16 169.29 B: instantly i mean just the the concept is 

167.49 168.54 A: yeah 

169.68 176.75 A: well it's just the whole idea that some big thing is happening that you know you get people are dying you know it's like i don't think 

175.47 176.57 B: mhm 

176.82 189.09 A: i don't ah i think it's pretty hard to to stay calm about something like that that's why i sort of you know understand everybody's you know big reaction about you you know since nine eleven because you know 

189.17 202.22 A: it it it just sort of opened our minds to the this notion that hey you know we could be attacked and killed and all that you know before nine eleven i think people never really thought about something like that happening in the us 

202.21 205.70 B: right i think it really did show how vulnerable we are 

205.64 207.41 A: yeah 

206.50 208.43 B: [mn] which i think is a huge 

208.79 211.38 B: wake up call for us because we're so 

211.45 212.53 B: comfortable 

212.57 213.52 A: yeah 

212.96 214.75 B: in our life you know here 

214.93 224.79 A: yeah and it also makes you realise that ah you know there are certain things that you you know to keep yourself safe you have to do i i you know for for one thing i didn't fly for awhile after 

216.44 217.02 B: (( [mn] )) 

224.85 226.00 A: nine eleven 

226.27 227.13 B: no 

226.34 237.79 A: no i um i've i've flown since then but it took awhile before you know i you know i wanted to wait and see how you know safe or unsafe air travel would be 

237.50 238.62 B: right 

238.13 244.50 A: um and i don't think that they've done anywhere near [mn] enough to 

244.69 250.89 A: to make i don't think air i actually don't think air travel's any safer now than it was before nine eleven 

251.34 254.65 A: it's just that the reason i fly now is because 

254.83 257.71 A: there's so many flights i sort of figured that 

258.17 272.58 A: i i if you know i i think a terrorist who wanted to take down a plane today probably could do it about as easily as they did on nine eleven it's just that there's hun- you know tens of thousands of flights every day so so even if 

266.36 267.38 B: mhm 

272.53 286.93 A: a terrorist decided to take down a different plane every single day you you could fly and the chances are pretty remote that you'd be on that plane so that's that's the whole reason i fly but it's not because i feel like they've done anything to make air travel safer 

276.15 277.18 B: mhm 

280.33 281.58 B: on that plane 

286.31 295.20 B: safer right i've flown since i've flown to new york and definitely yeah i thought about it it was a little bit more difficult for me to fly but i still 

292.22 293.24 A: yeah 

295.30 296.39 B: did it 

296.75 304.47 B: um you know what else about ah panic i think during a terrorist attack would also d- decide ah what a determining factor would be 

304.48 306.87 B: for instance if i was on the plane 

307.34 308.38 A: yeah 

307.82 315.62 B: that they used or if i was in the middle of the plot happening i think i would be considerably calmer than if i was 

311.80 312.72 A: yeah 

315.63 320.56 B: just stunned with ah w- w- with the missile type thing 

320.66 326.66 A: yeah i think that there's like something there's probably some part of your brain that takes over and says okay 

326.52 336.89 A: you know you can't just completely freak out and you that you there there's a certain amount of calmness your heart's probably pounding but you probably stay sort of calm just because you're it's sort of 

336.83 342.82 A: a- you know survival instincts your brain is trying to just focus on whatever you need to do to 

342.99 344.64 A: keep yourself alive 

344.17 348.80 B: mhm i worked at a pretty um well h- har- um 

350.19 358.07 B: u._c._l._a. med center the county hospital's down there for years and was in a fairly violent environment in the e._r. 

351.84 352.88 A: oh okay 

358.15 365.70 B: and i i was confronted more than once in situations and actually i was incredibly calm much calmer than i 

365.75 367.09 B: thought i would be 

367.30 368.11 A: wow 

369.00 380.41 B: um but that's because it was a situation where there was still time to to make a decision and to be involved one way or the other but when you're uninvolved and it's just happening to you 

376.70 378.38 A: yeah yeah 

380.89 382.96 B: that's a significant difference 

381.40 382.34 A: yeah 

382.72 393.19 A: that's that's actually really true that's you know like the earthquake thing you know you're the ground is just everything is shaking there's nothing you can do about it and you just you know it for me i 

393.18 399.58 A: you know i think i probably panicked during the ninety four quake on the other hand i was um held up at gun point 

399.76 400.70 B: uh-huh 

399.85 406.27 A: and i was a lot calmer when that hap- when that happened and i think it's because 

404.86 406.08 B: mhm 

406.36 419.93 A: some part of my brain said okay you have to be very careful to do you know you could be killed here if you do the wrong thing so you have to be very careful about what you do and so i sort of felt like 

412.09 413.24 B: mhm 

419.93 430.60 A: depending on what i do is going to depend on whether i live or die as opposed to the earthquake i sort of it it sort of feels like well it's you know they i don't really have any control over the situation 

429.61 432.71 B: yes there's nothing to do except respond 

431.39 432.31 A: yeah 

432.64 435.31 A: (( yeah i think that's yeah )) 

433.71 435.14 B: yeah i was in a 

435.19 440.12 B: confronted also in a situation where i had to remain calm to 

440.94 448.76 B: ah think through what to do to save myself type thing and i was able to be very calm actually 

448.88 449.85 B: so 

449.12 449.93 A: wow 

451.12 457.54 A: yeah well well hopefully we won't have you now any more situations where we have to 

451.50 453.08 B: [mn] ah that's just a 

457.07 458.27 B: are tested 

457.77 460.44 A: worry [laughter] worry about staying calm 

459.20 460.42 B: [laughter] 

460.49 461.35 A: um 

461.75 463.63 A: but ah you know i 

463.76 465.34 A: mean there's definitely 

463.85 464.70 B: i think 

465.36 466.54 B: go ahead i'm sorry 

466.19 476.04 A: i was going to say there's definitely terrorism in the world you know and i don't think that's going to go away but it's just you know it's just sort of an odd thing and it's being in the right place at the right time and not being in the wrong place at the wrong time 

475.49 476.52 B: mhm 

476.39 478.27 A: (( um what were you what were you about to say )) 

477.96 489.26 B: well i think also some of it involves some of your own reac- personal reaction involves other people that are involved around you for instance i have children in new york and grandchildren so if 

485.05 486.08 A: yeah 

487.77 488.40 A: (( huh )) 

489.68 494.87 B: something happens there i would be more ah in a panic than if it happened in a state 

495.24 503.86 B: that i didn't have people i was particularly concerned about obviously i would be concerned about everybody but i'm just saying on the personal note 

496.52 497.52 A: yeah 

499.19 500.94 A: yeah 

503.89 512.87 A: yeah yeah that was so interesting like we you know everybody's reaction was much bitter on nine eleven than it was 

504.44 505.59 B: you know that 

513.11 517.10 A: ah for the bombing of ah you know okla- the oklahoma city bombing 

516.89 517.90 B: mhm 

517.22 519.09 A: and um 

519.65 531.50 A: you know i think that it is because i mean obviously people would you know the day of the oklahoma city bombing people reacted to it but i think they sort of felt like well i would never be in some government building 

531.35 532.47 B: right 

531.51 543.53 A: but the thing that freaked people out about the ah twin towers was that it was airplanes and everybody flies on airplanes so it it changed that it was like people i know could be affected by this you know 

537.58 538.95 B: mhm 

542.72 550.10 B: it also is significant that a- that with the oklahoma bombing it it happened and then it was um 

550.74 556.25 B: it was presented to the public with nine eleven you watched it happening 

556.22 557.58 A: right yeah 

556.80 560.21 B: which was you know it really involved you in the 

560.38 561.25 A: yeah 

560.44 562.43 B: you knew what was going on because you 

562.47 566.71 B: you know once once the second plane hit you realised it may not be over 

567.04 568.03 A: right 

567.08 573.90 B: plus they hit such strategic you know the the money and the power of this country 

569.84 570.81 A: yeah 

573.78 574.85 A: right 

574.69 576.22 A: (( right yeah that's )) 

575.47 576.67 B: so 

576.02 589.88 A: that's definitely a big part of it but you know it it's also a yeah i think the thing like you were saying that you know you could see it a- you could see it happening and that you didn't know it was over like the oklahoma city bombing it happened and they said oh there was this been a there's been this big bombing 

589.77 599.89 A: the you know in oklahoma city and it it was over but with nine eleven you know there was one plane and then there was another plane and then there was the other one and then there was a third plane and um
