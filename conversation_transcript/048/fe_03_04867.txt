0.10 1.86 B: hey how's it going 

1.22 3.40 A: yeah good how are you my name's tom 

2.95 4.02 B: i'm danny 

3.60 5.19 A: hi danny how are you today 

4.70 6.30 B: i'm all right [cough] 

5.62 7.50 A: (( good where're you from )) 

6.94 8.86 B: ah sarasota florida 

8.13 11.67 A: sarasota florida i'm in ah right outside of washington d._c. right now 

11.27 12.48 B: right on 

11.89 15.70 A: yep is this the first time i've ah the first call i've accepted through this thing 

15.88 22.39 A: have you done th- several of these already ah okay cool well ah maybe you could walk me through help me through this one then 

17.41 19.19 B: yeah a couple of 'em 

22.10 25.42 B: right on so how do you feel about ah televised trials 

24.99 39.50 A: um i guess you know having not really thought much about it until just now um i think that ah it's a little winds up being a little too theatrical um you know a little too show boaty obviously the o. j. simpson trial's a good example of that 

38.90 40.67 B: yeah definitely it 

39.85 41.32 A: you know um 

41.74 52.21 A: m- you know i don't feel although i guess you know it should be i mean it's public you know public inter- you know public access public whatever so i guess maybe it should be televised oh certainly there's no reason why it shouldn't be 

52.30 55.34 A: um but i do think that it can be a little too show boaty 

55.57 67.22 B: seems i don't know it seems like if it's gonna be televised i- i- it just seems like a a a a good example of how silly a lot of court procedures are in the first place 

66.93 72.02 A: oh absolutely i mean i i guess my reference point of course would be the the o. j. simpson trial 

71.58 72.92 B: oh yeah definitely 

72.10 81.67 A: i mean that would be the the huge but now that i've seen um you know since that that kinda set a precedence and now that you know with court t._v. i flip through it every now and then while i'm s- surfing the channels 

81.61 94.55 A: and um i find it all to be quite pretentious and ah a lot of times it seems like ah it's it's about anything but justice you know it's um it's certainly um you know a a battle of wits between the two attorneys 

89.64 90.32 B: (( oh )) 

94.57 100.99 A: and um what the what they can spin into you know something into that favors them i s- s- w- i suppose 

99.27 102.08 B: (( yeah )) 

101.19 104.71 A: oh shoot can you hold on i guess i can't t- can't switch over huh 

104.24 105.68 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

104.84 107.00 A: okay well i'll let that call ride then 

107.14 108.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

107.51 114.14 A: um yeah but i guess i mean if you're gonna go that far then i think maybe we televise executions and all that stuff 

113.73 125.95 B: yeah well i and [laughter] i mean that's that's b- they basically the same kinda logic i mean it ah if it's gonna happen people there's no reason why people shouldn't have access to knowing about it but at the same time you know you don't [laughter] 

125.73 130.90 B: you don't want people start executing just so that like t._v. stations can get ratings or something like that 

129.11 132.06 A: exactly exactly i think it should be um 

132.54 139.14 A: eee done more in a eee a kind of more of a real vanilla type way i don't think it should be you know like 

139.90 143.68 A: like duh you know showcased so much it sh- should be maybe 

143.85 146.70 A: you know v- more vanilla if that makes any sense to you 

145.34 148.04 B: yeah i totally agree 

147.30 156.02 A: you know especially the trials because there's a i w- you know again flipping through getting stopping on court t._v. there's one woman in particular who just aggravates the shit out of me [laughter] excuse me 

155.80 157.07 B: [laughter] 

155.80 163.93 A: ah um you know and she really doesn't n- i mean it's definitely about anything but justice and and you know she you know serves up her opinion 

163.89 171.21 A: ah before the trial's even taken place you know and and based upon what she may or may not really know you know so 

166.70 167.62 B: (( ah )) 

170.80 173.01 B: [noise] yeah that's really annoying 

172.32 179.02 A: yeah um so i guess the gist of of these conversations are we just keep talking about this particular topic for the ten minute 

178.43 180.21 B: i think so yeah 

179.08 180.58 A: the ten minute time lapse 

180.62 190.03 A: oh that's cool well um yeah it's hard for me to um to relate to anything in my day to day life i w- i own and operate a tattoo shop right [laughter] outside of d._c. 

189.79 190.84 B: right on 

190.26 193.77 A: so that's primarily what i you know what i think about but um 

193.44 196.46 B: [laughter] yeah i don't know i 

194.10 195.72 A: you know i think i 

196.72 211.29 B: it doesn't really affect my my life too much in that i don't really watch t._v. but i really i think it's really interesting [laughter] and i i i definitely if i was gonna go to court i wouldn't wanna be on t._v. you know and it seems like 

204.23 205.19 A: yeah 

212.41 213.52 B: mm i don't know 

213.15 221.65 A: well i don't know if if ah i guess looking at it from that perspective if you if you had a court date coming up you you would definitely not want it to be televised i mean 

220.89 223.58 B: mhm definitely not 

221.84 227.03 A: ah w- why would you why would you say not do you think it would be a disadvantage to you possibly mm 

226.13 231.35 B: i feel like it'd probably it it might be a disadvantage i feel like it'd probably be embarrassing it'd be like i don't know 

231.43 232.29 B: i 

232.88 233.95 B: i'd rather 

234.09 236.19 B: you see people are gonna know about like 

236.93 241.48 B: i don't know i think i'd rather have a little bit more control about my public image than 

241.02 246.87 A: right right well you know that any court proceeding though is is completely open to the public anybody can attend 

241.98 242.71 B: than 

246.46 247.70 B: yeah 

246.99 251.56 A: you know i mean granted not you know not fifteen million people in their living rooms but 

251.48 266.33 A: you know it's it's all very public there's very little private privacy involved when you're charged with a crime and you have to go to court i mean it's all very public information and public accessible but um i mean obviously something like ah o. j. simpson w- it it worked to his advantage 

257.17 258.09 B: yeah 

266.19 267.83 A: in a lotta ways um 

267.03 268.30 B: oh yeah it did 

267.78 281.35 A: you know he got the sympathy of of a lotta people and and the whole thing became a big circus but it in in in you know retrospect looking back on it now it it totally worked to his advantage i mean i don't know for sure because i wasn't there but he sure does look guilty to me 

280.94 282.82 B: oh yeah definitely i mean 

281.72 287.49 A: you know i mean i'm in no granted o. j. simpson's probably the only one that knows for sure but ah 

286.76 294.94 B: well it seems like the only people who aren't pretty much convinced that he is guilty are the people who were on his jury i mean [laughter] 

292.49 293.51 A: right 

293.43 302.06 A: right and how much of that was was you know out of ah racial prejudice you know all that took place right af- you know right after some of the riots and stuff like that 

301.77 302.83 B: yeah 

301.90 313.57 A: um and i think a lotta people were afraid if ah he had been convicted there would've been a huge eruption of of of violence again you know like the ah reginald denny case and ah ah whatever that guy was that got beat 

309.03 309.87 B: yeah 

313.32 315.68 B: yeah definitely 

313.78 314.76 A: (( and um )) 

315.00 320.72 A: um but ah but yeah rodney king he just got arrested again he drove his truck into somebody's house or something 

320.07 322.63 B: [laughter] 

321.04 324.22 A: and all all h- drunked up or highed up or something 

323.73 331.29 B: that's great well that's a li- that's a little bit harder to justify than just getting beat up [laughter] that's too bad 

324.60 325.74 A: (( yeah )) 

327.89 330.44 A: yeah exactly exactly 

330.38 341.08 A: yeah but i mean like i say i mean ultimately whether or not ah cases are televised it seems to me that the only ones that they they're worried about televising are are you know huge cases with a lot of public interest so that 

340.85 349.04 A: you know they can boost their ratings and stuff like that it's definitely about about making money i think that people can monopolize off of off of someone elses misfortune 

349.08 349.94 B: yeah 

349.12 352.75 A: and ah you know that that that's not necessarily a good thing 

352.78 364.21 A: um but again it doesn't affect me really one way or another and i don't watch those programs very often they don- they don't captivate me or anything um so i i guess i don't have a a strong opinion in one way or another 

359.47 360.64 B: yeah 

364.30 372.87 A: i do think it's interesting um that some are selected and some some judges completely you know ban ca- cameras from the courtroom 

367.32 369.78 B: (( mhm )) 

372.82 380.15 A: um and that you know how how do you ch- pick and choose which ones are are viewable and which ones aren't and you know how much ah 

380.53 386.23 A: how much of the evidence and how much of the the case is decided long before the actual 

386.17 388.73 A: testimony is heard and evidence is presented 

387.29 388.48 B: yeah definitely 

388.54 393.54 A: you know just based on the analysis from all the different ah reporters and stuff back in the day if you were ah 

393.36 407.35 A: you know quested to a jury you know you really were you know were not informed as you are now it's hard for for you not to know about a big case prior to you i mean there's so much media and exposure and anything you know that um 

405.28 406.77 B: yeah definitely 

407.35 416.43 A: you know by the time you get to be any juror well it l just with like the o. j. thing anybody on that jury had had already s- to some degree or another formed an opinion whether they were willing to admit it or not 

416.10 419.88 B: yeah i mean and everybody knew who he was it was he was it wasn't like 

418.12 419.17 A: right 

419.58 420.79 A: right and obv- 

420.01 421.76 B: i yeah 

421.13 433.55 A: obviously that decision was more racially motivated and and anything 'cause the evidence was clearly there i mean it sure looked like he was guilty to me i mean there was blood on his you know his all over the place and why the hell was he running f- in the first place [laughter] you know 

428.46 429.47 B: yeah 

433.15 434.11 B: uh-huh 

433.31 442.34 A: that's the crazy if he didn't if he didn't do it well there's no reason to run from it you know and there was more in- stuff indicating that he did it than there was stuff indicating that he possibly didn't 

436.46 438.21 B: yeah 

442.42 443.66 A: and um 

443.72 445.17 B: yeah 

443.74 448.84 A: i don't know it's it's a big but after that circus that kinda i mean that set the tone 

448.41 458.02 B: well i think i i mean part of that is probably racial but i think a lotta that is definitely the fact that he's a celebrity you know like people who're rich don't don't you know get the electric chair 

454.00 454.98 A: right 

457.44 468.43 A: right and it's i mean he he b- had the dream team of attorneys that's for sure i mean he's he had the best attorneys money could buy a- and um you know those guys took full advantage of everything it seemed to me that the prosecutors ah 

463.44 464.32 B: yeah 

468.82 477.62 A: you know in charge of prosecuting the case that woman and ah didn't have the the chutzpa or whatever that um they were kinda bullied by cocker and those guys 

477.31 478.37 B: uh-huh 

477.85 479.68 A: and that you know their evidence 

479.98 486.69 A: w- as as damning as it was you know carried little weight because they didn't present it in a in a circus sideshow kind of way 

486.15 488.48 B: yeah [laughter] 

486.54 499.70 A: and it w- it was so it was kind of overlooked whereas you know w- the glove didn't fit you must acquit was was so th- theatrical that you know that's what stuck in the minds of the jurors as opposed to there actually being blood all over the guy's vehicle and 

499.03 502.37 B: yeah that's not li- that's an argument that's a slogan you know 

501.81 503.04 A: right 

503.14 512.77 A: right well that's a it's a tough to talk about this if you [laughter] if you don't have a op- too much of an opinion on it and stuff there's still up ten minutes worth of time so how many how many of these calls have you done 

510.38 511.30 B: yeah 

512.53 513.85 B: this is my third 

513.26 517.90 A: your third one yeah and then you get what l- like ten bucks a call is that what they're saying 

514.02 515.20 B: yeah 

517.22 519.35 B: something like that 

517.92 520.75 A: yeah that's pretty good for just sitting around doing nothing 

520.34 522.95 B: yeah i'm into it [laughter] 

521.21 524.78 A: yeah but what do you do are you a student or what do you do for a living 

524.65 525.99 B: i am a student 

525.43 527.35 A: you are a student you go what school do you go to 

527.03 528.26 B: new college 

527.99 529.36 A: what's it called 

528.77 532.14 B: new college in sarasota new college of florida is the name of the school 

530.00 531.14 A: oh okay 

531.49 535.83 A: yeah i used to s- live down in jacksonville beach florida but um 

534.20 535.11 B: right on 

536.22 537.15 A: i were 

536.38 547.50 B: well m- more about court [laughter] yeah i don't know i w- w- m- the main thing i think about when i think about stuff like that like i definitely think about o. j. simpson and how ridiculous that is and how like 

537.85 540.07 A: yeah back to the court thing 

547.57 559.27 B: that changed everything and then the but then i i really do think about like what if i was in court or like what if i had to testify or something like that it just seems like it'd be so much more pressure being on t._v. and 

558.57 560.11 A: oh absolutely 

559.41 564.92 B: like i mean do they do they put make up on people like who do stuff like that 

562.17 566.63 A: yeah and is yeah exactly is there light checks and lighting checks and 

566.60 570.00 A: all that stuff yeah that there's definitely and anybody who's 

569.05 570.86 B: commercial breaks and stuff 

569.89 581.79 A: yeah any yeah well you gotta figure court t._v. is the you know main um you know network that's doing right now and they sell commercial time so you know they're definitely monopolizing and making money off of the the court case itself 

581.70 585.55 A: um that certainly doesn't seem right that somebody should be able to capitalize off that 

585.16 586.95 B: yeah 

585.55 599.89 A: and you know in that regards i think it's totally a a bad idea to to televise 'em if it was on public access you know uninterrupted and there were no commercials involved and very very ah sterile kinda w- you know just very sterile d- 

590.39 591.28 B: yeah
