0.00 1.61 A: (( hello uh )) 

0.73 3.45 B: oh w- hello ah my name is david 

3.10 4.98 A: hi my name's eric how are you today 

4.68 6.06 B: pretty good eric 

5.77 8.52 A: uh have you ever participated in the fisher project before 

8.32 10.49 B: ah i've done two so far 

10.04 11.34 A: oh same here 

10.97 16.23 B: yeah i haven't been paid yet though [laughter] [laughter] um 

13.28 14.47 A: [laughter] 

15.99 17.59 A: well i guess i'll let you start 

17.67 18.81 B: i beg your pardon 

18.55 20.60 A: i'll if you want to start i'll let you 

20.80 24.65 B: oh okay well um i i'm kind of of 

24.47 30.85 B: two different minds on this because you know i i think that people should have a a right to 

30.67 32.79 B: privacy at a 

32.63 46.11 B: criminal trial if if that's what they would like in in terms of it being televised ah i mean i know people can attend a trial in any case but um i'm not so sure about t._v. coverage 

46.07 48.41 B: (( ah on the other hand um )) 

48.69 62.56 B: i mean i i've seen a couple of high profile trials in recent years i i don't watch too much of that stuff but i think it's a good education for the public it teaches you a lot about the law and ah makes you aware of certain things 

63.03 68.61 A: i was ah it i thought this was actually a very interesting topic 'cause i'm starting law school at the end of august 

67.47 68.40 B: oh 

68.43 69.34 B: are you 

69.14 70.95 A: ah yeah here in 

69.94 71.89 B: where where are you gonna study 

71.30 73.78 A: ah south western here in los angeles 

73.23 74.29 B: oh very good 

74.59 76.70 B: are you interested in criminal law do you know 

76.46 79.10 A: oh actually i was thinking more along the lines of corporate law 

78.68 80.46 B: (( okay [noise] [noise] )) 

79.68 81.76 A: and um actually i was also 

81.91 93.16 A: kinda ambiguous about how i felt about this topic because on the one hand when you have a big celebrity trial it can turn into a big media circus like o. j. simpson and the blake trial 

89.99 91.04 B: (( [noise] right )) 

93.16 95.64 B: [mn] so so you yeah [noise] 

93.36 101.07 A: but on the other hand yeah y- you just kind of as an american citizen you have a right to have this public trial because 

102.01 110.02 A: if it's held in secret they can pretty much do whatever they want to you and that was kinda the whole point of like the american revolution is that in england they could pretty much 

105.92 106.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

110.16 112.61 A: do what they want throw you away 

113.12 115.37 A: you know lock you up throw away the key 

114.74 116.44 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

115.67 116.99 A: so um [lipsmack] 

117.65 121.82 A: actually there's a big concern about that with ah the inmates at guantanamo bay 

121.86 122.89 B: (( [cough] so yeah )) 

121.91 135.10 A: that they're having these military tribunals and no one's exactly sure what's going on in these trials that's exactly why you need public trials because you need that kind of oversight t to make sure that there's no wrong g- doing going on 

127.74 128.79 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

134.84 136.86 B: right but um 

137.18 139.12 B: you know i think um 

139.38 140.55 B: (( you know )) 

140.65 143.32 B: we we we've had public attendance 

143.48 155.30 B: at court trials for s- some time but ah the question is more specifically about t._v. coverage um which i think is a a little different but um 

155.41 156.67 B: yeah i mean because 

156.89 166.39 B: you know journalists reporters can cover trials [noise] but um you know they're not allowed to take photographs for example they can make sketches or maybe that's changed 

164.92 166.84 A: yeah that's one of those loopholes 

167.55 170.08 B: yeah um 

170.79 173.48 B: yeah i know i mean i share i share your 

173.61 176.24 B: concerns with w- what you said i mean 

176.33 189.35 B: m- it also seems to me i mean this is getting off the trial and t._v. topic a little bit but ah i mean it seems to me that there was a l- a lot of um discretion in in terms of um 

179.58 180.86 A: no go ahead 

189.65 197.24 B: [lipsmack] a probable cause for issuing an arrest warrant for example and that there are a lot of abuses there too 

197.57 198.65 B: um 

198.90 205.20 B: i mean it it just seems that the standards nationwide are are so variable 

207.29 212.96 A: well i mean that's that goes all the way back to like the civil war you know state law versus federal law you know 

211.93 217.06 B: [noise] yeah yeah um [noise] but 

217.29 218.80 B: i don't know ah 

219.64 224.52 B: a- as far as t._v. a a high profile [noise] criminal trials 

224.53 229.34 B: um i i i'd have to say you know if i had to give a yes or no answer i i would say no [noise] 

231.23 233.40 A: well i think it just kinda depends on 

233.43 238.97 A: like what type of case we're talking about because on the one hand if it's like a big celebrity 

238.56 239.52 B: mhm 

239.06 243.44 A: let's say like o. j. simpson because that's probably one of the most famous recent examples 

240.46 241.39 B: right 

243.79 246.95 A: a ah the trial becomes just entertainment and people lose 

246.27 247.65 B: yeah 

247.72 251.79 A: i don't think it actually affects the outcome necessarily 

251.57 254.86 B: y- you don- you don't the pr- think it prevents [noise] someone from getting a fair trial [noise] 

255.84 269.09 A: um i'd like i like to have faith in the justice system and say that you know hey they can find jurors that aren't gonna be affect- that aren't gonna be swayed by the media i guess ah i guess i'm being an optimist like being an idealist whatever you wanna call it 

263.62 264.73 B: yeah 

268.10 269.27 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

269.64 270.89 A: but um 

271.04 285.68 A: 'cause on the one hand if you have like a corporate scandal like enron or worldcom it helps to expose and shed some light on hey there's white collar crime going on that we need to do something about this because it's it's gonna have an effect on your life it's gonna have an effect on the economy 

274.69 275.46 B: yes [noise] 

285.80 287.72 A: rather than having it swiped under the rug 

285.90 286.92 B: yeah 

287.99 292.78 A: which could be done in other countries if you didn't have public trials 

294.16 295.02 B: um 

295.37 306.34 B: r- right right so i mean the the trials are public but as far as the you know having t._v. cameras present ah i'm not so sure that's a good idea 

306.48 308.96 A: well when you consider that like most people 

309.64 320.90 A: have televisions and the one great thing about television is that it's audio visual you don't have to be a literate you don't have to necessarily speak english or be able to read the english language and it's 

310.65 311.58 B: yeah 

313.39 314.18 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

321.73 325.00 A: it's like the one way of getting most people 

325.10 326.90 A: of getting them information 

326.81 327.83 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

326.97 328.73 A: and that's kind of why 

329.19 332.19 A: it's so important that we should have the trials televised 

331.99 340.43 A: is that somebody in the middle of nowhere that can't read a newspaper that just arrived in the country and can't speak the language 

340.24 353.02 A: they can still see this trial and see that a justice is being done in our country and this is sort of a way of indoctrinating them in to our justice system so it's al- it's just almost kind of an educational way for new citizens 

351.26 352.07 B: yeah 

352.35 356.30 B: no the- there there is that element definitely um 

356.73 358.28 B: [lipsmack] i don't know 

358.42 359.56 B: ah 

359.62 362.55 A: and i'm not exactly sure that most people would actually 

362.97 371.52 A: bother to watch a trial unless it was like a big like o. j. simpson type of thing i mean there is court t._v. i mean there is judge judy but 

367.07 367.91 B: yeah 

369.33 384.00 B: yeah i think w- i think when ah when court t._v. first came on the scene i mean it made such a big splash and i i don't really know what the viewership is like now but my guess would be that um you know there might have been more people watching it earlier on 

384.00 387.11 B: ah at least that that's true in my case um 

387.27 387.88 B: (( w- )) 

387.45 398.43 A: well i mean trials for the most part are just they're very boring very procedural and the only reason you're gonna watch is if there's some sort of celebrity or a big scandal but i mean for the most part no one wants to watch 

390.64 391.55 B: yeah 

396.49 397.37 B: yeah 

399.01 403.40 A: like a a divorce trial a few people they don't know in some state they've never been to 

399.07 399.96 B: yeah 

403.13 406.00 B: yeah but i you know i think that um 

406.19 410.40 B: [noise] programs like the people's court if you're you're probably familiar with 

410.06 412.05 A: oh yeah every- everyone watches that [laughter] 

410.40 424.38 B: um i i think that kind of cheapens the whole thing and ah you know th- that that is more of a entertainment than than a a serious way of putting people in contact with the justice system 

424.13 435.41 A: well actually it's kinda funny that you mention that because i learned recently that the reason most people go on there is that if you lose the shows producers' they offer to pay the fine for you so there's that incentive 

427.53 428.44 B: yeah 

435.15 436.55 B: yeah 

436.38 437.53 A: so um 

437.84 443.10 A: i guess in that way if you can't afford to pay the fine and even though it's kind of 

443.51 445.90 A: you're embarrassing yourself on television 

446.49 449.37 A: they're offering to pay the fine for you so if you're 

449.00 449.76 B: (( ah )) 

449.65 455.19 A: not exactly in a good financial position i guess so i guess you could say it serves some sort of purpose for the public 

451.29 452.30 B: yeah 

453.51 462.61 B: [laughter] possibly that's true yeah i i guess that explains why people who you know have such a bad case and they're almost sure to lose w- will will actually go on 

462.63 467.39 A: so i guess you could say there's a silver lining there m- once again i'm being the optimist [laughter] i guess 

467.06 468.20 B: [laughter] 

468.58 470.01 B: (( yeah [mn] you )) 

470.06 478.69 B: know because there there've been a few um offshoots of that original program and it and i i think that that they keep getting worse and worse 

478.78 483.36 A: well i mean you you could almost s- spin that to an argument against reality television in general it's 

483.82 487.44 A: it's not necessarily these legal shows it's 

487.45 489.05 A: basically the whole 

489.17 496.12 A: american population's becoming obsessed with reality television we want we don't want the fake we want something that's somehow genuine 

496.00 497.27 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

496.71 502.01 A: and that's why you're seeing shows like survivor and judge judy and everything becoming so popular and 

501.38 502.58 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

503.02 510.08 A: i'm sorry if i went on a little rant there just i took an introduction to television class at u._s._c. and we just kinda discussed that so 

509.88 510.73 B: (( oh )) 

511.37 512.20 B: huh 

512.67 513.24 B: (( [mn] )) 

513.45 515.06 B: well ah 

515.13 516.13 B: sure 

516.20 517.11 B: so 

517.22 531.90 B: i don't know ah you know i i like i say i've got i've got mixed feelings about it and you know i think that maybe if if things were done with certain criteria that were less of an entertainment or exploitive nature 

531.93 533.06 B: um 

533.13 541.12 B: you know with with better guidelines i might i might be in favor of you know t._v. access all the time but 

541.30 544.09 A: well w- sometimes when you use words like 

544.20 555.78 A: kinda like entertainment it becomes kind of ambiguous because people could argue that the news is starting to lean towards more entertainment you know if you watch like headline news and you have like some sort of 

555.82 559.69 A: story about jennifer lopez and ben affleck is that really 

559.79 564.88 A: you know an important news item or are they just doing that to bolster the ratings because they know people like that 

561.36 562.53 B: mhm 

564.29 566.30 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

566.16 570.67 A: so sometimes you have to wonder you know is the trial 

570.96 579.61 A: is it really that important to the nation or are they just doing it because hey it happens to involve a celebrity and they're just trying to get a quick ratings boost 

579.61 580.17 B: (( [cough] )) 

580.61 588.24 B: oh yeah i mean i i saw a couple of things on court t._v. i mean this was some time ago but i mean they weren't always um 

588.52 591.41 B: you know high profile things but i mean they had some 

591.44 599.95 B: interest in terms of where they were going with with this like um things that hinged on ah medical malpractice
