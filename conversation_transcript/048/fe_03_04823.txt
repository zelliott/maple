18.02 19.42 A: [laughter] 

20.75 24.31 B: crawl over the women and children no um 

24.33 27.50 B: yeah i think it depends on what kind of attack it was 

27.20 29.08 A: yeah i think that's a good point 

28.56 38.26 B: i mean if it was like you know a car bomb or a you know just a bomb an explosion in general i think you know you're natural ah reaction would be you know shock 

38.20 39.29 A: right 

39.40 47.33 A: um just this morning we had report that ah at yale which is obviously close to me there was an explosion and 

45.04 45.98 B: uh-huh 

47.91 52.04 A: no one knew what it was about and of course with all this increased 

52.48 58.90 A: tension and alertness about terrorism you know people started to kind of freak out a little bit 

55.36 56.36 B: mhm 

58.30 59.61 B: yeah 

58.94 60.26 A: but um 

60.03 62.62 B: was it like a pipe bomb or something 

62.01 66.36 A: they don't know yet ah i haven't checked the news to see if 

63.08 63.89 B: (( oh )) 

66.75 69.75 A: determined what it was from but um 

69.33 70.30 B: uh-huh 

70.23 73.31 A: i tell you i don't know i i think this all this 

73.38 75.98 A: yellow orange red whatever 

76.07 78.24 A: is just for the birds 

77.62 80.71 B: (( [laughter] i know [laughter] )) 

80.07 83.31 A: i really do i mean i don't see how it helps 

80.90 82.06 B: yeah 

83.37 84.58 A: the public 

84.87 87.39 A: because we don't know how we're supposed to react 

87.37 88.38 B: yeah 

87.63 89.33 A: or respond to it wh- 

89.46 97.63 B: and every time they raise the alert they're like just go about your lives as normal and it's like okay then why do you have the alert 

94.01 94.98 A: [laughter] 

97.06 98.71 A: be vigilant 

98.11 99.97 B: yeah 

98.97 101.09 A: well i'm not exactly sure what that means 

101.62 103.09 A: (( you know i don't know )) 

103.64 105.28 A: (( i mean if i see some- )) 

103.67 106.92 B: yeah yeah it's i mean yeah what does it mean 

107.79 110.86 B: that is the question i don't know yeah 

110.26 114.01 A: i'm not a big ah george bush fan i have to confess 

114.13 115.14 A: um 

115.15 116.20 A: you know he's 

116.87 120.15 A: for him to get reelected he's got to get the economy going 

119.69 120.73 B: uh-huh 

120.28 123.37 A: and i think the best way to get the economy going is just 

124.31 126.24 A: stop with all this terrorist 

126.47 128.97 A: you know freaking us out stuff 

128.54 130.75 B: yeah 

129.56 130.59 A: um 

131.27 134.03 A: 'cause i think that's what a lot of people are nervous about 

134.46 135.91 A: and 

134.53 146.09 B: yeah well i mean really what he's doing right now in conjunction with the feds they're just trying to keep the economy going just enough just to get him through the election 

146.10 160.61 B: but it it it has to take a serious downturn when it's all said and done because i mean they think they can skip the normal business cycle through all their monetary policy and stuff but it just doesn't work like that 

161.34 166.39 B: [cough] so yeah i don't know i think i think he probably 

166.56 174.34 B: they can keep it going and there's no other major terrorist attacks i think he'll probably get reelected if i had to guess 

175.01 176.35 A: i guess 

176.36 177.43 A: (( i don't know )) 

178.37 183.63 A: but you know all those tax cuts they're talking about having to try to stimulate the economy 

181.32 182.29 B: uh-huh 

184.13 187.03 A: i feel like telling 'em don't waste your time 

186.59 188.32 B: yeah 

187.46 193.31 A: just just stop with the terrorist alerts and ah you'll be fine but i don't know what do i know 

192.27 199.53 B: so you think the economy would recover if it you know if they had like a different policy in this terrorism and all that stuff 

198.91 201.20 A: i do i think it's poised to go 

201.25 202.23 B: uh-huh 

202.17 203.13 A: but 

203.42 210.27 A: you know i'm not an economist so i really don't know what i'm talking about but it seems to me that 

210.40 213.11 A: you know get the tech sector going again 

213.18 218.93 A: and get the corporations to start spending a little money you know would go a long way to 

216.85 218.18 B: mhm 

219.20 221.33 A: getting us out of these doldrums 

220.95 223.93 B: yeah see i'm a trader so 

224.18 238.18 B: i mean typically i just focus on the charts but you know i i kind of get into economics and all that good stuff so the the problem is is capacity utilization is only like at seventy two percent it 

230.28 231.40 A: sure 

237.25 239.70 A: and what does that mean capacity utilization 

238.95 246.12 B: well okay basically industry they're only using twe- seventy two percent of their capital 

245.79 246.82 A: okay 

247.12 254.92 B: so with that being said the feds making all this money cheap well that's just like say you went out and bought a new sofa 

255.22 269.46 B: and then um two weeks later the price of a sofa went down by two hundred dollars you'd just say oh that's great you know wow sofas sure are cheap but i have a sofa so i'm not gonna go out and get another sofa 

269.23 270.23 A: right 

269.64 279.01 B: the same way with business right now sure you know they're all the fiscal stimulus you know lowering interest rates but they're not even using what they got 

280.14 283.65 B: so that's kind of the problem we're in right now 

282.75 284.89 A: [noise] yeah so how do you get 'em to use it okay 

285.57 289.07 B: well there has to be demand and the demand's not there 

285.72 287.96 A: (( right mm )) 

289.16 294.26 B: there was [mn] just during the tech boom there was just overcapacity you know 

294.27 300.17 B: too much investment too many companies and there was just basically too much stuff 

300.58 307.68 B: and see is what you have happening now which is real bad you know the fed and treasury they're printing all this money so 

307.59 318.08 B: the cost of all these raw goods are going up like commodities while prices that the um businesses can sell their products for are going down 

318.69 321.88 B: (( so yeah i don't know ah i'm not very )) 

321.97 324.46 A: [laughter] no 

323.45 326.67 B: positive [mn] no no 

324.76 325.51 A: you 

325.72 327.19 A: you're bowling me out 

327.10 328.89 B: yeah but who knows 

328.97 330.34 B: we'll see what happens 

330.56 333.40 A: so how did you get started participating this ah 

333.64 335.74 A: voice recognition program thing 

335.44 343.92 B: actually ah my old job a friend of mine forwarded me an email from this lady who i guess participated and um 

344.04 345.92 B: just signed up like that 

345.31 346.64 A: mhm 

346.53 351.75 B: yeah went to the website and it's like okay i'll do three conversations for thirty bucks 

352.19 353.48 A: pretty good 

352.84 354.76 B: yeah yeah 

354.39 357.84 A: um i worked for a consulting firm 

358.07 360.16 A: um based out of cambridge 

360.41 364.13 A: and we're bought we were bought out a couple of years ago by verizon 

364.06 365.41 B: (( that's who i used to work )) 

365.43 366.49 A: you did 

365.92 368.04 B: verizon data services yep 

367.42 368.32 A: okay 

368.54 369.78 A: (( and ah )) 

369.93 373.48 A: i guess somehow b._b._n.'s involved with this ah 

374.59 378.07 A: with this voice recognition effort with penn state 

377.81 379.71 B: mhm 

378.98 379.82 A: (( so they )) 

379.93 382.38 A: encouraged the employees to participate 

382.42 393.35 B: okay so now what ah is it like some what exactly is the end goal of the um project is it some sort of product or you know is it what is it gonna do exactly 

393.08 400.24 A: honestly i don't know i i think it's more research into making voice recognition more robust yeah 

394.47 395.28 B: (( mm )) 

399.26 400.29 B: okay 

401.74 416.14 A: so i i guess the way voice recognition systems work you know some are just hardwired and they don't get smarter over time others learn ah to recognize your voice patterns over time 

414.66 415.59 B: mhm 

416.12 418.43 A: and i think the idea here is to try to 

418.52 427.08 A: get it off get it right the first time so people with different dialects and different mannerisms of speaking so they can sort of 

425.54 426.76 B: mhm 

427.49 428.95 A: handle the bandwidth ah 

429.25 430.56 B: (( hm )) 

431.36 435.36 A: so you went from working for verizon to working in commodities 

435.12 448.49 B: oh well actually i just trade the s&p five hundred index yeah i did that for about two and a half two and three quarters years and yeah i got that job right out of school and it it was a good job but 

438.70 439.53 A: uh-huh 

448.64 457.93 B: i mean i kind of knew i wanted to trade all along and they started taking away a lot of benefits and just the morale really started plummeting at work 

457.95 467.77 B: so i just said you know i got enough money to last me about a year year and a half plus i got my trading capital i'm gonna quit so that's what i did 

467.46 469.32 A: so you're trading your own money or 

468.56 471.93 B: yeah it's my own money mhm 

470.15 471.20 A: really 

471.31 475.06 A: and you're just following fluctuations in the s. and p 

474.89 478.72 B: pretty much it's only been about two months so far so 

479.24 485.55 B: the jury is still out but ah i'm trading really small like today i think i'm down like ten bucks 

479.25 480.13 A: (( so you )) 

485.29 486.20 A: uh-huh 

486.13 498.81 B: and so i mean really up until now i might have a day where i'm down like fifteen a day when i'm up twenty so i'm actually down a little bit but it's negligible in relation to my account so 

498.17 501.19 A: so do you sell short too so you write it up and down 

500.76 502.74 B: oh yeah oh you have to 

502.41 503.62 A: yeah 

502.95 504.58 B: if you're doing intra day 

504.58 505.87 A: right 

505.26 506.95 B: definitely 

506.51 507.92 A: that's pretty wild 

507.70 519.17 B: yeah so well it's what i really wanna do and i mean so far i like it you know no commutes no boss i just gotta start on the money 

508.25 509.90 A: so you like 

518.57 520.44 A: are you considered a day trader 

520.35 523.50 B: i would be considered a day trader yep 

522.99 525.18 A: wow i thought you guys all went away 

524.97 529.70 B: [laughter] that's what they think but really um 

530.34 545.02 B: a lot of the ah people who just you know made the easy money and once the market turned yeah that group went away however there's a lot more people coming into it i believe because it's so um cost effective now 

544.90 545.72 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

545.32 550.24 B: i mean the commissions are so low it it really makes sense as a business 

550.31 564.10 B: like um for instance i trade s._b._y. the s&p five hundred tracking stock for only a penny a share for the commission so like white right now while i'm learning i do a hundred shares at a time it's only one dollar 

564.39 565.58 A: that's great 

565.20 573.64 B: so i mean the commissions are so low and you know with broadband and all that it's just it's kind of leveled the playing field 

573.50 574.43 A: yeah 

574.89 576.15 A: well good luck to you 

575.85 577.98 B: (( [mn] yeah it's ah )) 

578.58 580.68 B: yeah we'll see what happens 

580.01 581.41 A: i'd be too chicken 

582.03 587.64 B: yeah well i figured you know i'm only twenty nine i have no wife i have no kids 

587.21 588.33 A: mhm 

587.80 598.62 B: you know my vehicle's paid for ah you know very little debt my i live you know very modestly so if i'm gonna do it now's the time to do it 

590.30 590.86 A: (( [mn] )) 

598.02 599.88 A: yeah roll the dice 

599.33 599.89 B: yeah
