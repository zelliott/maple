18.69 20.72 A: [mn] do you live close to ah 

20.92 22.91 A: you you live in new york city 

22.30 23.80 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

23.90 26.62 A: so you were around when the ah 

27.36 30.20 A: the on september eleventh were 

30.14 31.84 B: yeah yes 

30.83 33.06 A: you close to where it happened 

32.46 40.06 B: well i'm not too far from there but when it happened ah somebody told me about it and then i ran out and i just saw after the 

36.82 37.65 A: (( oh )) 

40.11 47.09 B: after the the second tower had um collapsed and then immediately i got involved in ah 

47.01 58.85 B: in trying to do something and helping and i went to one of the hospitals 'cause i was standing right by st vincent's and i started gathering people to donate blood and so i got involved like as soon as it happened 

58.27 59.69 A: yeah 

59.80 64.55 B: so ah [noise] but i guess the question they're asking us is like ah 

65.35 71.55 B: well i guess well i guess that answers the question like what do what do you do for it what would you do if you were were attacked 

72.09 73.51 B: so um 

75.28 81.58 B: i guess if it could come really close to me i mean if i was in the building or something i'm sure i would have been like completely 

81.80 84.37 B: freaking out um 

81.97 83.11 A: (( ah yeah )) 

83.55 84.11 A: (( [mn] )) 

86.51 88.61 B: i don't know i th- well i don't know which 

89.17 91.29 A: [laughter] well 

89.58 91.31 B: [laughter] 

91.57 93.74 A: um 

92.19 102.55 B: i think it was more the media i mean of course it was frightening it was very frightening in the beginning of course and then my biggest fear was that there was going to be some more 

95.01 96.11 A: well yeah 

98.85 99.60 A: (( who )) 

102.71 106.09 B: ah you know definitely more attacks going on and my 

105.06 108.66 A: yeah it was blown out of proportion of how like 

108.89 114.30 A: like so much more was going to happen that but nothing really happened 

111.88 112.54 B: mm 

114.54 116.88 B: well it puts you yeah that's a good thing [laughter] 

116.40 123.77 A: yeah well it is obviously a good thing but it was blown out of proportion like all this other stuff was going to happen but it never really did [mn] 

118.14 119.37 B: (( yeah )) 

123.09 124.16 B: yeah 

124.24 129.60 B: i think um my biggest my biggest fear is the um [mn] chemical warfare 

129.17 130.66 A: oh yeah 

130.05 144.48 B: that's that's what i kept thinking might be the next thing and then i you know avoided going for a while to large crowds i said that that's putting myself you know at risk you know so i guess i was a little 

138.34 139.24 A: yeah 

142.56 143.38 A: well 

144.80 149.67 B: cautious of some situations but you know it didn't it didn't st- you know at the beginning 

150.00 153.86 B: but then ah you know then i kind of just got back to my 

150.50 151.43 A: yeah 

154.31 155.88 B: my regular ah 

156.13 157.22 B: i guess 

157.46 160.06 B: modus operandi or something [laughter] 

159.94 160.93 A: yeah 

160.34 162.45 B: but i think it was more 

163.01 170.60 B: i think that what happened since you know because now we keep having these different colored terrorist things now i think this is getting a little bit much 

170.32 171.25 A: yeah 

170.62 172.30 B: and i think it's because 

172.34 177.71 B: i think it could have been my personal feeling is i think the first one could have been stopped and there's just so much 

177.82 178.77 B: (( ah )) 

177.99 182.42 A: yeah i think it definitely could have too 'cause they knew about it before the planes even hit 

180.16 180.90 B: (( yes )) 

181.45 192.90 B: y- yeah th- there's a lot of stuff i mean i i don't [laughter] you know i just i don't trust what's going on so i mean i think it could have even been some of our own people were involved in this so 

192.32 194.27 A: yeah definitely 

192.95 195.03 B: ah so um 

195.65 197.29 B: the the 

197.71 202.18 B: now it's like yeah it's orange it's green it's blue it's because now they're trying to you know 

202.64 206.61 B: you know save their own butts now because they didn't do it right the last time 

206.25 207.43 A: yeah 

206.81 214.92 B: you know but you saw all these people that went on t._v. and were saying we knew this was going to happen my boss told me to keep my mouth shut and all this you know people that worked for the c._i._a. 

214.77 216.03 A: yeah 

215.29 216.86 B: so but 

216.96 221.52 A: they're definitely like not telling us some things that we should know 

221.04 223.99 B: oh yeah i mean i just i i totally 

224.41 227.69 B: i totally believe that but um 

228.52 241.08 B: y- y- you know i'm just i don't know about panic i mean if if a bomb fell like right in my back yard i'd probably get a little [laughter] a little nervous i might panic originally 

238.68 239.69 A: yeah 

241.14 243.76 B: you know if there's people out of control around me 

244.19 248.77 B: um i just can't imagine what it was like for people who who 

249.28 251.35 B: you know were coming out of that building 

250.98 252.39 A: yeah 

251.75 252.66 B: you know 

253.37 254.19 B: (( um )) 

255.21 257.62 B: i don't know i mean i i 

257.80 262.73 B: might imagine myself at- attempting to stay calm but again if i had people ah 

263.96 268.90 B: all around me and absolute chaos that that would be like completely frightening 

268.52 270.57 A: mhm 

269.94 271.32 B: but ah 

272.93 277.70 B: you know now with all this going on it's it's just kind of mind boggling with 

278.19 279.49 A: yeah 

278.31 279.02 B: ah 

279.30 283.99 B: everything else that's going around you know not not just the terrorism i mean 

284.39 288.86 B: just all these scams that are going on now [laughter] 

285.07 285.95 A: [noise] 

287.13 288.88 A: yeah 

288.94 291.96 B: by our own people at the subways and all that 

291.47 292.59 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

292.03 296.12 B: um i mean now they're hyping it up again they're saying you know that 

296.66 308.91 B: you know again we're at high alert with memorial day coming and yeah i mean the thing that's scary in one way is like you know i know there's terrorists that still live here and they're like you know they're people's best friends and they don't even know it [laughter] you know 

298.42 300.49 A: yeah and the security level went up 

307.48 308.55 A: yeah 

308.98 309.97 B: and that 

310.12 313.13 B: we're the ones who educated them to actually kill us 

313.31 314.28 A: yeah 

313.67 316.34 B: you know and and the other thing that's frightening 

316.52 322.74 B: but i don't panic about it but it's frightening is i mean when you think about it it's like these guys they came on the plane with a knife 

323.11 325.98 B: with box cutters do you believe that that 

324.19 325.09 A: yeah 

326.12 329.48 B: created this from people with box cutters i mean this is 

328.22 329.18 A: yeah 

330.00 336.10 B: you know and then after all this there were still people still getting into airplanes ah with weapons on them [laughter] 

335.97 337.00 A: yeah 

336.40 337.55 B: i mean 

337.10 339.11 A: (( mhm )) 

338.44 342.22 B: that's scary in a way because i mean people ah you know 

342.62 348.93 B: they're having all these things going on but i think it really gives people a f- a f- it's a f- really a false sense of security 

350.25 358.86 B: i mean 'cause if you have guys with box cutters coming coming on a plane i don't care if you have these guys with guns and dogs i mean you know if it's the simplest thing that's getting by people 

359.28 361.15 A: yeah 

360.29 361.46 B: so um 

362.58 367.41 A: the the security on a- at airports like really went up after 

367.46 369.51 A: that whole situation so 

369.54 370.43 B: right 

369.71 370.50 A: (( ah )) 

372.21 374.98 B: and now they're cutting them back though [laughter] 

374.29 376.06 A: yeah 

376.69 377.74 B: yeah 

378.48 379.59 B: where were you 

379.81 380.89 A: what 

380.28 382.42 B: when when at nine eleven where w- 

381.60 391.26 A: i was actually in school at the time and um they actually turned on the t._v. and everything and stopped class so we could watch the news but i 

383.82 384.46 B: (( mm )) 

392.14 393.94 A: that was basically it 

393.40 394.25 B: mhm 

397.49 402.31 B: so and what did you feel when they kept showing it over and over and over mm 

400.28 410.19 A: oh yeah it was on for like weeks just just constantly on the news and i it was really like blown out of proportion and 

403.12 404.22 B: mhm 

414.11 416.03 A: the thing with ah 

414.15 414.84 B: yeah 

416.35 428.58 A: the war in iraq is that weapons of mass destruction and all that that that was definitely also blown out of proportion they didn't find anything there 

417.82 418.68 B: mhm 

420.01 420.91 B: [laughter] 

420.97 421.94 B: yeah 

424.83 425.92 B: yeah 

426.88 427.61 B: mm 

428.93 431.35 A: and i just think the whole war was 

431.39 432.76 A: wrong 

432.16 433.09 B: mhm 

433.65 440.09 B: i mean i personally believe they may still have some and this guy is like a psychopath but the fact that ah i mean 

437.70 438.60 A: yeah 

440.22 447.83 B: [laughter] you know i mean they were going under the guise of like oh we don't want to do we don't want a we don't want a part of their oil i mean everything's such a [laughter] lie 

447.61 448.85 A: [noise] yeah we 

447.91 452.09 B: it's blatant lying i mean all over the place 

451.92 457.47 A: or they're just to free them and then while we're freeing them we're just killing all these people 

455.05 455.80 B: yeah 

457.19 458.11 B: yeah 

457.72 458.59 A: for 

459.09 460.64 A: oil i guess 

460.01 461.09 B: mhm 

462.09 464.66 B: oh yeah i mean it's all about money in the end 

464.05 465.50 A: yeah 

464.69 468.81 B: i mean you know now with the subway fare and all that i mean it 

468.82 476.49 B: it [laughter] and all this stuff and you know and that and these policemen giving like these bogus tickets for like stupid things 

476.16 477.19 A: yeah 

476.60 489.26 B: i mean it's a it's it's totally out of control i mean i personally want to organize the one million i'm really pissed off people march [laughter] but then i'm sure that i'll get arrested if i you know you have freedom of speech to a certain point you know 

483.20 485.25 A: [laughter] yeah 

488.84 490.57 A: yeah it's so yeah 

490.03 493.55 B: [laughter] you know i mean there's all these double standards 

493.69 497.89 B: so i mean the fact that ah you know that the m. that the m._t._a. 

498.12 499.99 B: (( ah was caught in a lie )) 

500.50 514.15 B: and ah that they had two books and i went to the hearing and what the other side was saying was so stupid and ludicrous and now if they had the judge that was supposed they were supposed to turn you know ah turn the fare around ah roll back the fare 

500.65 501.56 A: yeah 

514.37 515.31 A: yeah 

515.02 519.46 B: and then the m._t._a. got this other judge it's all politics to put a hold on it 

518.97 520.19 A: yeah 

519.50 531.51 B: so obviously the people with the money are paying off this guy and ah that's the way it is and i understand why people kind of don't want to organize and kind of take their power back i mean we're being scammed left and right [laughter] i mean 

531.80 532.66 B: you know 

531.97 534.11 A: yeah 

533.51 547.11 B: i mean it's sort of our own form of ter- we're we're terrorizing each other i mean they're kicking people out of jobs and then these c._e._o.s that make billions of dollars make up their own salaries and then they fire all the other workers in their company and what's that about [laughter] 

546.24 548.38 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

547.26 551.12 B: and then we want to pay for healthcare in iraq what's that about 

551.02 552.11 A: yeah 

551.42 560.76 B: so and i don't understand i mean i i i mean i would love to be involved with something to like stop it and i don't i don't know what to do as one person prob- problem is people are just too damn lazy 

560.48 561.66 A: yeah 

560.94 563.15 B: you know but i think personally 

563.29 565.34 B: everybody should be protesting 

565.38 569.13 A: i i yeah i won- yeah did you 

567.08 568.11 B: you know what i mean 

569.27 576.95 B: ah well it's if someone is organizing i would you know i once like i was at the subway protest and i'm going ov- the protest for the rent stabilization 

576.58 579.71 A: there was a big one in new york that i wanted to go to 

579.29 580.20 B: mhm 

579.86 581.77 A: but i didn't get a chance to 

581.18 589.40 B: but i mean there's no one that specifically to organize anything that has to do with ah spending the money in iraq and and i mean this has to be done on a major 

584.66 586.00 A: oh yeah 

589.53 598.18 B: major major level everybody has to get involved i mean we're just being taken advantage of i mean here we have they're driving the middle class out 

592.63 593.55 A: yeah 

598.65 599.64 A: yeah 

599.03 599.89 B: you know
