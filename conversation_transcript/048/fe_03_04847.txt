7.04 14.33 A: um so a terrorist attack do i think people would remain calm or not um i don't think they would remain calm at all no 

13.97 24.30 B: absolutely not um actually i was ah i'm in downtown d._c. and when we had the ah terrorist attack here ah and there was a lot of panic in the city 

15.04 15.93 A: no 

23.18 27.02 A: yeah i'm in new york and i was here on september eleventh and ah 

26.16 27.62 B: right 

27.10 32.77 A: i didn't i didn't really see a lot of i mean i wasn't downtown you know i wasn't down by the world trade center so 

32.03 33.90 B: (( right )) 

32.97 41.69 A: i didn't see a lot of ah people panicking it was really weird um i mean when i went outside people were just acting really normal and like nothing was going on but 

35.11 36.43 B: (( yeah well we )) 

41.15 51.84 B: well i was in downtown d._c. and there was gridlock everywhere with people trying to get out of the city um there was everything shut down all the buildings and everything closed down 

45.26 46.13 A: yeah 

47.08 48.26 A: (( oh yeah )) 

51.51 52.65 A: right 

52.07 56.76 B: actually i have um a friend in new york ah a customer of mine that's in new york 

56.84 60.26 B: and his son actually works in the world trade center 

60.57 65.24 B: and but fortunately he wasn't there that day when it when it happened so 

63.61 64.51 A: uh-huh 

65.30 69.84 A: yeah yeah i knew [mn] ah one of my best friends worked there and he um 

69.95 80.70 A: he just wasn't there that day he was going to go in an hour later and but i know know people that were downtown and they saw everything that was happening and and it just sounded like you know complete madness and ah 

79.92 81.84 B: (( right )) 

80.71 85.34 A: yeah i'm i'm convinced that if there's another attack people would not be calm people i mean 

85.53 92.69 A: besides you know that one time no one's ever there hasn't been anything like that and people would just they wouldn't know how to react and 

92.06 96.56 B: right even when they ah the alerts go up people kind of panic a little bit 

92.89 94.26 A: (( people would freak out )) 

95.97 97.27 A: when what 

96.70 101.25 B: i say when they when they have their alerts yeah yeah they they tend to panic 

97.70 99.85 A: oh when the alerts yeah 

100.84 102.77 A: do they do that in d._c. 

102.23 105.08 B: oh yeah yeah 

103.21 109.20 A: 'cause here i mean i i don't think people even you know it it's always kind of crazy here so 

108.83 122.40 B: well that that you can tell by the tourism because i'm in downtown and the tourism has dropped off a lot it's just recently it started picking back up a little bit i think because that maybe the war is over and they think it'll settle down a little bit 

114.36 115.27 A: yeah 

117.41 118.57 A: yeah 

122.13 128.27 A: yeah i mean tourism dropped off in new york for a little while but it's it came right back pretty quickly i think i mean 

126.49 129.84 B: [laughter] well in new york is another world 

129.33 136.06 A: yeah it's it's totally totally different thing i mean you go to time square and it's nothing but tourists and they don't seem to be too bothered by it so 

135.47 137.34 B: right 

137.18 138.74 A: yeah um 

137.89 139.59 B: right 

139.40 140.22 A: (( ah )) 

139.68 144.64 B: yeah what do you do you just ah stay calm and and ah and do the best 

143.18 155.95 A: yeah i mean w- what can you do i mean i'm sure it's different in d._c. 'cause every everybody drives everywhere and stuff but i mean here it's it's the subway and you have to take the subway to get to work and you know i mean someone could 

148.89 150.58 B: yeah [laughter] 

151.36 153.12 B: (( right )) 

155.05 163.77 B: yeah 'cause in d._c. a lot of people come in from ah maryland suburbs and the virginia suburbs so a lot of them are crossing the bridge into the city every day 

160.37 161.33 A: yeah 

163.93 168.83 B: and in mass transit there's also a lot of um mass transit in d._c. too so 

168.15 169.36 A: yeah 

169.08 170.06 B: um 

170.50 175.73 B: i'm not sure whether or not they that dropped off because of that 

174.19 176.25 A: [mn] yeah i don't know i mean in 

176.60 186.23 A: [mn] in new york a lot of people just need it and you can't you can't get around it so i mean i was riding the subway you know the day after september eleven so 

186.40 193.89 A: i actually rode it on september eleventh after it happened it was weird you know i was kind of freaked out but you know what are you what are you going to do 

193.75 195.58 B: right 

194.56 195.42 A: so 

196.05 198.53 A: yeah no people will definitely not stay calm 

198.29 203.66 B: oh new york is gridlocked any day anyway [laughter] 

201.04 203.63 A: yeah i don't drive in new york too much so 

203.83 213.40 A: um we're actually leaving the city tomorrow and we're going to leave on tour so we're in brooklyn and we're going to go through manhattan and hopefully if we do it at two o'clock it won't be so bad but 

212.84 214.65 B: right 

213.92 218.39 A: yeah it's i i don't i don't how people drive in new york every day it's insane 

218.87 223.93 B: yeah i don't know how they drive down here either 'cause it's it you spend a lot of time in traffic 

220.87 221.80 A: yeah 

223.68 225.20 A: (( do you drive to work though mm [mn] )) 

224.69 229.80 B: yeah takes takes about an hour hour and a half sometimes um 

228.08 230.15 A: (( yeah that's that's crazy [mn] )) 

229.88 237.79 B: yeah so and then in the city you can ah actually in certain areas you will see where they have the um armored vehicles 

235.45 236.01 A: (( mm )) 

238.23 241.03 B: um parked yeah it's 

240.96 245.64 A: yeah well in in new york i mean whenever they raise the terror level to orange or whatever 

241.09 242.62 B: a lot of 

245.76 248.57 A: um you'll see people in the subway 

248.65 256.88 A: you know in like fatigues and with you know assault rifles and stuff just kind of standing around i don't know what they're going to do if [laughter] something happens but 

253.54 255.39 B: (( right )) 

256.94 260.16 A: it's it's just weird a strange thing to see 

259.82 264.31 B: right now in new york have they um the police driving around with the lights on 

264.78 265.88 A: (( oh )) 

265.20 272.91 B: because in district they there even though when it's not an emergency they're driving around with the the siren and police lights on 

268.74 269.59 A: uh-huh 

273.33 281.37 A: um i mean i don't i don't think so i mean i think just when they when they need them i don't see them driving around like that all the time hm 

280.75 285.52 B: right i think that the police chief from here got that idea from somewhere in chicago 

285.91 294.92 B: and that's where he got the idea and his staff here is the all day long the lights are on it makes you kind of scared too [laughter] 'cause you think they're after you [laughter] 

290.29 291.31 A: that's weird 

292.31 293.70 A: yeah i mean 

294.26 297.74 A: yeah well what happens when there's a real emergency what do they do you know 

296.39 299.29 B: right yeah 

297.82 299.68 A: (( it seems kind of strange )) 

299.54 300.45 B: so 

300.72 311.75 A: yeah i guess it'd be different if there was something if there was some attack and i was in a car as opposed to i mean if you're in the city you can just run [laughter] but if you're in a car and you're stuck in traffic what are you going to do 

311.14 314.57 B: right when you when you leave brooklyn do you go through anita tunnel 

314.53 319.35 A: yeah we go we go through ah we go across manhattan 

319.08 320.19 B: oh okay 

319.66 321.88 A: go through the harlem tunnel and everything 

321.33 324.08 B: oh so you you ever think about it if 

323.85 335.75 A: yeah i mean i think about it i'm in the tunnel and i think well what if something happens while i'm in the tunnel i mean i just nothing i can do really i think about it in the subway you know what if i'm in a subway car and there's some kind of gas attack or something i 

327.72 329.58 B: right 

335.53 336.23 B: mm 

335.69 341.48 A: mean there's not a whole lot i can do if the doors are shut and i'm underground but [mn] mhm 

339.89 345.42 B: right well in downtown what i do is um i work in a bank so 

345.51 352.32 B: anytime anybody leaves anything around especially bags or anything we try to get it out of there as soon as possible and ah make sure 

350.51 352.29 A: (( oh yeah yeah sure )) 

352.48 366.57 B: notice that they take their stuff with them when they leave we don't want it hanging around so there's a little paranoia around that and actually they move they removed all of the post office boxes around the city the mail boxes 

355.72 357.16 A: yeah exactly 

358.70 359.64 A: right 

364.10 365.20 A: (( yeah i think )) 

365.65 368.64 A: oh just regular old mail boxes huh 

367.04 370.36 B: yeah they removed all of the mail boxes 

370.37 374.79 A: yeah i think they did something in new york they took the garbage cans away or something or they put 

375.00 379.12 A: they put like clear bags in them or they did something with the garbage 

378.93 380.88 B: right 

379.27 382.11 A: cans yeah that's bizarre 

380.92 381.64 B: mm 

383.01 386.98 B: [mn] that's one thing that affects everybody can't find somewhere to put your mail 

383.04 383.92 A: yeah 

386.48 389.77 A: right or put your garbage i mean new york's dirty enough you know 

387.74 389.07 B: (( yeah actually you're e- you're )) 

389.16 395.10 B: even you're even afraid to get your mail sometimes you know with the anthrax scare and everything you know 

391.63 392.63 A: yeah 

394.10 397.51 A: (( yeah well it doesn't look like it's getting any better so )) 

397.58 401.05 B: oh no the mail still must go mail there 

401.30 404.69 A: mail i mean the mail's okay here but 

405.91 406.86 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

407.14 411.42 A: i i i've been to the the big post office where they had the anthrax scare and everything 

410.84 413.98 B: right actually the one in d._c. is still shut down 

413.70 414.82 A: oh really 

414.26 420.02 B: yeah that happened the ah main post office in brentwood has not reopened yet 

417.26 418.09 A: uh-huh 

419.55 423.15 A: yeah people just kind of forgot about that whole anthrax thing pretty quick i think [laughter] 

422.37 432.08 B: [laughter] oh no maybe some people but the ones that are affected by it you know it it's kind of rough on them especially people who work in this area who work in that post office 

426.34 428.06 A: yeah yeah i'm sure 

428.35 429.36 A: yeah 

431.84 433.55 A: yeah 

432.55 433.39 B: (( you know )) 

433.68 435.09 A: huh so 

435.22 438.87 A: people are just they're not getting their mail or just getting it slow mhm 

437.32 441.67 B: well it it's slower than it actually has gotten better since um 

442.32 448.49 B: since the ah scare but um the post office still closed they had to route the mail ah to other places 

449.73 450.58 B: (( you know )) 

451.23 453.57 B: but it's gotten a lot better 

452.55 456.36 A: hm yeah yeah to we've just gotten used to it anyway i think 

455.76 457.49 B: right 

456.53 457.31 A: (( so )) 

458.45 462.21 B: ah do you travel a lot i mean airplanes do you ever think about 

461.63 466.26 A: um i mean i've i've taken a few trips since september eleventh and 

465.54 466.67 B: on airplanes 

466.34 467.61 A: yeah 

466.84 470.79 B: [laughter] what are your what are your feelings like 

469.79 471.34 A: um ah i 

471.55 484.88 A: don't know i mean i just figure there's not a whole lot i can do about it um i mean the security's a lot tighter going through the metal detectors and everything which is good and i think people are just more aware of you know people sitting around them and weird stuff going on 

474.62 476.46 B: right 

478.60 480.51 B: (( right )) 

484.64 488.56 B: what are the d- ah delays like in new york in on the air- airplane 

488.62 501.55 A: i don't think they're that bad it's just ah it's just you need to get to the airport a lot sooner 'cause the lines are long to get through the metal detectors and stuff and they check people's bags and stuff so um other than that it's not it's not all that different 

493.42 495.20 B: (( right )) 

497.18 498.93 B: right 

500.85 503.64 B: mm do they do spot checks or does everyone get checked 

503.77 516.71 A: um i think it's both i mean everyone gets checked and then they'll just sort of grab certain people and go through their stuff but i don't well i don't know if they go through everybody's stuff maybe they do now but it's just it you you just have to get there a lot sooner 

509.31 511.07 B: (( all right )) 

516.67 518.51 B: right 

517.06 519.33 A: just go through all the 

518.68 522.35 B: what about the park area 'cause i know um do they have a lot of scares in the park 

522.52 523.79 A: i don't think so 

524.29 535.01 A: i don't think so m- most of the security seems like it's in ah the train stations especially grand central and time station and and the tunnels like harlem tunnel there's a lot of security [mn] but 

529.59 531.33 B: right 

534.32 538.09 B: do they do do they have security in the tunnel 'cause they do that or do they have cameras 

537.78 546.86 A: um i i'm sure they have cameras but they have people sitting you know right in front of the tunnel and ah you know like army guys with guns and stuff 

542.51 544.27 B: right 

547.65 548.55 A: um 

548.61 552.21 A: yeah but it's just a fact of life in new york i mean we've 

552.03 553.92 B: right 

552.44 553.93 A: all just gotten used to it i 

554.61 556.79 A: think have you flown since then 

556.32 562.29 B: ah no [laughter] haven't actually i i don't take public transportation i don't fly 

557.26 558.48 A: oh really 

561.89 562.97 A: oh wow 

562.43 565.76 B: um or the train 'cause ah 

563.82 564.78 A: huh 

565.73 578.95 B: if i go anywhere i'll drive yeah it's a little scary 'cause i had um actually m- ah we have a friend that she was actually on the bridge when aircraft crashed into the pentagon 

567.19 568.50 A: yeah 

568.76 570.03 A: (( that's interesting hm wow )) 

579.34 582.57 B: so she saw the airplane actually go into the pentagon 

583.08 585.30 B: which is a scary sight in itself 

585.16 586.93 A: yeah 

586.28 587.16 B: so 

587.48 594.48 A: yeah i had a friend who was going to work and she ah she was on september eleventh she was on the subway and she got out of the subway
