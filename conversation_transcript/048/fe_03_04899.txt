199.06 204.36 B: what they the depression drug is gonna what the outcome is gonna be 'cause most people 

204.60 207.77 B: thinking that killing themselves get addicted to drugs

265.23 268.39 B: they i mean if there was another way for 

269.32 277.65 B: um even if it's to be healed without the use of drugs i would suggest that uh if a japanese they use a natural herbs is a 

277.83 289.00 B: very good example and it goes to the use to cure i mean instead of using those drugs it will have been taken up together and mixing it for a cure 

289.42 291.76 B: (( that's very effective as far as i know )) 

291.80 295.67 A: yeah that's for su- that's for sure

298.75 299.97 B: (( yeah i listening )) 

302.17 308.18 A: i i'm not sure i fully understand your uh what you said there but uh 

308.84 312.14 A: anyway uh it sounds to me like that uh 

312.84 314.17 A: you uh 

315.05 318.94 A: you know you're sort of in the middle of this thing 

320.16 323.60 A: i mean about about testing 

320.34 321.50 B: (( i'm in the middle )) 

323.09 325.35 B: yeah uh if you it's 

326.06 330.26 B: it's uh i think testing it for drugs is not invasion of privacy 

331.54 333.43 A: you think it is 

333.38 334.73 B: you think it is 

334.34 343.12 A: i i tend to think it's uh could be uh but but it's you know it isn't it's against the law 

343.44 346.00 A: of our land to take drugs so 

346.16 359.35 A: and and don't you think that there is there is life without drugs there's life without you know even tobacco there's li- like life without uh drinking 

359.70 361.55 B: yeah i know if you 

360.68 363.45 A: i mean i i think uh 

363.47 367.54 A: i can enjoy my li- i enjoy my life being drug free 

367.55 371.30 A: uh and i don't have to have uh something like that to 

371.31 372.74 A: make me happy 

373.23 374.27 B: (( okay )) 

374.71 378.12 B: if um if you gonna say 

378.30 380.21 B: testing of drugs is 

380.42 386.43 B: invasion of privacy i mean then doctors who ain't gonna be allowed to know how he is 

387.32 390.50 A: well i tend to think that uh you know 

391.09 403.95 A: and that people uh that yeah just like uh people who are in sports and and uh you know professional sports especially or any or in the olympics sort of thing i think uh 

403.93 408.01 A: uh random testing would be all right i just don't think that 

408.38 412.44 A: you know everybody should be tested uh 

412.48 416.15 A: you know across the board um 

416.63 421.90 A: i don't know if you understand where i'm coming from or not but i think if it if it was 

418.29 419.10 B: yeah 

419.16 421.02 B: i do yeah 

421.71 436.63 A: just like uh when we pay our we file our taxes well everybody don't get checked every year but but uh some do and the very fact that some do uh will help others to do to do what's right 

436.12 441.64 B: mhm yeah that's true well right now what issue look is the direct effects of 

441.70 445.18 B: what it could ah what it could happen if 

445.36 448.21 B: you don't test okay for example you 

449.29 451.78 B: if i'm playing against a drug addict 

451.91 455.11 B: if we're playing soccer every day on the football on the 

455.13 470.11 B: on the field and every day he's stronger than i am he he could run two hundred miles instead of running hundred miles and is like way ahead of me i mean that's not that shouldn't be allowed 'cause he's under the influence of something or 

470.05 478.63 B: you you taking a lady's under the influence of drugs and you didn't you not you not conducting a test to know if she's all right or 

478.79 482.57 B: or not and you let her not be a baby sitter or your nanny 

482.64 486.72 B: and what if the effects do come up and she 

486.83 488.65 B: mishandles the kids 

489.01 497.11 B: i think that this is very possible so that that time you should consider and about an incident of you looking at it as an invasion of privacy 

497.62 499.56 B: look at it as a necessity 

500.51 504.10 B: (( because the adverse effect could be very very terrible )) 

505.54 511.71 A: well i realize that you know invasion of privacy is a very sensitive issue and um 

512.24 518.37 A: we live in a democratic country and and um but we you know still yet 

518.45 519.50 A: uh 

519.93 529.05 A: i think uh the laws are say we should do something well we should do it at least at least follow the principles of law 

529.39 537.35 A: like when you're driving on a highway i know most of us go over the speed limit at times but uh i 

535.72 536.45 B: yeah 

537.61 541.59 A: i always try to stay within you know five miles of the speed limit um 

541.70 551.72 A: uh of whatever the speed limit is i try to not go over that speed limit by more than five miles now i know [mn] that i'm breaking the law but 

551.72 562.95 A: i also have had a policeman tell me that they they wouldn't he wouldn't uh pick anybody up for five mile over the speed limit because anybody can do that whether 

562.87 575.60 A: you know at any time with a car but and and i think at least you know we need to uh obey the principles there's a principle involved you know in in our country and uh 

575.56 578.61 A: we we need to uh to uh 

579.03 581.34 A: we need to uh know wha- 

581.50 582.47 A: you know 

583.11 586.82 A: i guess forever or or or try to 

587.35 599.89 A: [mn] try to stay within the law is what i'm trying to say that to the best of our ability and when we have a law against something then we shouldn't do it and then uh if we then
