0.17 2.49 B: oh hi this is ariti 

2.00 4.44 A: hi my name is kevin 

3.84 9.85 B: hi nice meeting you um so what are your points about t- today's topic 

9.92 14.74 A: uh well i think today's topic is uh terrorism yeah um 

12.44 13.56 B: yeah 

14.89 20.53 A: i'm not sure how i would react uh to be honest [laughter] if there was a a terrorist attack 

20.56 21.68 A: um 

21.81 25.78 A: it's something i've been thinking about a lot because of you know everything that's been going on 

25.80 26.81 A: but um 

26.96 32.39 A: i honestly don't know if i would panic or if i would be able remain calm i guess it depends on 

32.96 40.22 A: uh under what circumstances it occurred you know if if it was in public or if i was at home when it a attack occurred what about you 

40.37 53.31 B: right the same thing yeah uh i mean it's very easy to say that uh okay i'll try to be calm if there is any terrorist attack and all that stuff but when it happens to you or your fam- or your loved ones 

53.18 63.76 B: i mean it's very difficult to be calm and you know um even on radio when i hear that there is high alert for terrorism that was yesterday i was listening to the 

63.73 70.54 B: radio and then again uh like there was a panic i would wanted to reach home as soon as possible 

70.63 72.11 B: and um 

72.31 85.39 B: you know uh and uh as besides like i live in a metro city so i always have this fear that mm some at some moment i don't know when there will be attack like the um 

85.45 98.38 B: um the uh the attack on world trade center has really panicked me a lot like there is a fear in my heart somewhere that the same could happen to me any time any moment 

98.15 102.22 A: mhm yeah yeah i think a lot of people feel that way 

99.14 100.00 B: so 

101.92 102.95 B: yeah 

102.32 106.45 A: right now especially uh i had friends who lived in new york uh 

106.42 107.39 B: mhm 

106.55 115.00 A: when the uh trade center was attacked and uh they told me that you know the the atmosphere of the city just completely changed for a long time after that 

114.07 118.86 B: yeah like my perspective for life has totally changed after that 

118.95 126.38 B: um now i have become more family centered person d- uh spending more time with my family and uh 

125.57 126.75 A: (( mhm mm )) 

126.48 127.47 B: (( you know )) 

128.00 131.78 B: just praying god to uh to have everything fine 

131.78 134.90 A: yeah yeah i i feel the same way i i think it's 

135.03 147.31 A: it certainly puts life into perspective because i i think most people who live in the united states just are not accustomed to that kind of thing and just recognizing that you know it it can happen anywhere at any time 

147.16 148.33 B: yeah 

147.34 156.01 A: and so it it's important just to to focus on what's important in your life your family and and god and you know just you know the the basic things in life 

153.61 154.72 B: (( true right )) 

156.35 157.59 A: (( yeah so )) 

157.67 161.94 A: so um are do you live in uh the philadelphia area 

162.13 166.72 B: uh no i live in massachusetts i live uh near boston so 

166.30 168.80 A: okay okay uh i'm in philadelphia 

167.21 173.92 B: so i mean uh because i mean yeah boston is like high prone city for [laughter] 

174.08 176.47 B: terrorists so yeah 

175.84 181.08 A: yeah well uh we both live in in like you said larger metropolitan areas so 

180.28 181.74 B: right 

181.18 186.15 A: um uh i heard about the uh the bomb attack at yale university 

186.10 190.00 B: oh yeah yeah today i was listening to the same thing on the radio 

186.55 187.96 A: yeah yesterday 

189.61 194.23 A: yeah and and they still haven't s- said you know who might have uh 

190.08 191.40 B: (( this is like )) 

194.50 204.78 A: uh left bomb but you know it's something to think about when things like that happen you always worry and start to think about you know what kind danger you might be in and your family and things like that 

199.85 201.13 B: yeah 

203.56 214.99 B: yeah no place is secure these days but at the school uh i mean even in the top schools i was listening to the radio and there was the news that some harvard grad student he 

209.85 210.72 A: yeah 

215.43 223.97 B: he just you know stabbed someone and you know he he's even refusing to cooperate in uh all judicial processes now 

217.73 218.65 A: (( mm mhm )) 

224.40 225.46 B: i mean 

225.50 226.85 B: (( i mean uh )) 

227.02 236.58 B: [sigh] it's kind of like especially in school i was grad student recently and uh you know we had a lot of students from these middle east countries 

236.66 244.82 B: and uh i mean they are good students but you know because of some people they they're career is being affected in a very 

244.91 259.40 B: uh you know now they are rejecting the visas and they're not allowing they are allowing very selective students to come here and all so because of the you know work of a few people so many other people are being affected 

259.26 260.86 A: yeah yeah 

259.95 260.91 B: i mean 

261.84 273.41 B: attacking is a different thing attacking is of course for affecting many people's lives but attacking's also affecting the whole economy everybody is affected by these 

273.50 279.65 B: um these actions you know the economy is suffering if you've seen larger wha- 

277.75 278.35 A: (( mhm )) 

279.76 281.76 B: in a broad spectrum 

281.48 282.43 A: (( yes )) 

281.82 294.44 B: you know day to day work looting everything has been affected people who don't have to do anything that these uh with attacks and all but everyone is directly or indirectly has been affected by that 

293.73 304.99 A: yeah that that's true i i was a student up until a year ago as well and um there are also a lot of uh middle eastern student at at the school that i attended and um 

303.54 304.78 B: mhm 

305.01 314.41 A: i don't think that they really curbed uh who can come here as much at least according to school policy but i know that the federal government has 

309.46 310.72 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

314.26 326.51 A: you know placed some limit so so it's unfortunate that a lot of people will have to suffer you know people who just want to come here for an education and you know to improve their lives and they're having to suffer because a few 

315.82 316.91 B: yeah 

321.03 322.28 B: (( yeah right )) 

326.95 330.58 A: uh people who just you know have these 

330.12 332.05 B: yeah and 

331.22 333.20 A: these mo- motivations mm 

332.97 346.45 B: yeah and the people who die in attacks and these terrorism but more than other people die b- in wars and you know in reaction to that so many sho- soldiers died in afghanistan in iraq 

346.31 347.24 A: yeah 

346.63 352.43 B: and all these things you know i mean i don't know where these things are going to lead at all 

353.15 354.10 B: [laughter] 

354.83 356.59 B: (( it's kinda weird )) 

356.49 359.17 A: yeah it it's hard to say but uh 

359.09 372.70 A: a- a- as they say the world keeps getting smaller so more and more everyone is having to think about things that uh are going on all around the world at you know at at one time maybe thirty or forty years ago people 

361.87 362.93 B: mhm 

371.55 372.42 B: (( yes )) 

372.70 382.35 A: wouldn't even think about what happens you know in a in a country all the way of the other side of the earth they they would think it didn't affect them at all but today we have to be always 

379.98 381.04 B: yeah 

382.37 387.62 A: um vigilant in in observing what's going on around the world because it it will affect us in some way 

387.82 388.94 B: yeah 

387.85 389.57 A: uh at some point 

389.03 390.20 B: right 

390.87 401.00 B: so the the same thing like you know and with all these things the hearing about the bioterrorism it it's kind of amazing like you know 

398.20 399.41 A: yeah 

400.36 400.92 A: (( [mn] )) 

400.91 406.85 B: even if a person's sitting next me or in if i go and if he sneezes you know 

406.77 408.03 B: (( the thought )) 

407.95 411.35 B: comes to my mind even if i i mean i 

411.22 419.86 B: think that it's really callous i mean i should not think it this way it's wrong on my part to think this way but if one if a person sneezed like 

419.66 427.41 B: the thought comes to my mind that mm is it trying to spread something or you know does he have sars or 

427.02 428.05 A: yeah 

427.44 432.77 B: i mean i it's way wrong on my part to think in such a narrow way but you know 

433.03 438.26 B: the thought comes to my mind and i think it's all this is responsible or like 

438.29 440.14 B: hearing all these 

440.27 442.46 B: news and radio and all 

442.71 443.65 B: i mean 

443.77 449.32 B: i i really feel guilty that i'm being so so shortsighted but still the 

449.37 452.53 B: (( thought comes to my mind at least once )) 

452.42 465.80 A: yeah well i don't think anyone can really help feeling concerned uh nowadays just because of everything that's going on and especially because the the media reminds us of it constantly and you know i i know that's their responsibility to keep everyone 

462.61 463.60 B: yeah 

465.78 468.23 A: uh alert and and um 

467.91 468.97 B: yeah 

468.53 483.46 A: in- informed about what's going on but sometimes i think that we take to heart things that uh we really need not because the truth is that this could have happened these kind of things could have happened at any time in the past you know twenty or thirty years it's just that only now 

479.85 480.69 B: right 

483.23 484.38 B: yeah 

483.50 489.72 A: uh people have decided to to start acting on it and there's really i try to take the attitude that 

490.02 503.98 A: y- as you said we should just focus on what's important in life and you know there's not much we can do to prevent it we can't close off the borders and say that no one can come in and even if we did that there are people e- even in this country you have 

503.74 507.50 A: who who are even american citizens who have you know uh 

507.66 515.07 A: uh bad uh thoughts towards other people and and they would do the same thing so you know there there's really no way it's just 

512.01 513.20 B: yeah 

515.28 523.51 A: unfortunately become a part of modern life and something we have to live with and and i think the only thing we can do is just try to be uh 

523.85 532.73 A: uh good people and and good neighbors and and try to appreciate the people that are important to us in our lives and and i i think hopefully hopefully 

530.27 531.52 B: yeah 

532.74 540.47 A: as human beings we will learn to uh have more respect for each other and for and for human life and and uh just 

539.56 550.03 B: you know you have put it in such beautiful voice [laughter] i'm really impressed uh i mean i wanted to say the same thing but yeah uh uh i'm impressed the way you have spoken to it 

541.89 543.42 A: [laughter] 

550.27 554.82 B: so yeah i think your way much correct 

554.60 555.28 A: (( mm )) 

555.58 562.78 A: so um have there uh boston i know i know isn't that far from new york really not much farther than say philadelphia is 

561.41 562.55 B: yeah 

562.83 566.36 A: um what were things like in boston after the the attacks mhm mhm 

566.46 580.67 B: um it was um like it was scary because three of the planes went from logan airport uh for the uh world trade center attack so it's kinda scary i i i recently fly from 

580.83 593.54 B: uh i took the flight from logan airport and you know still the security is not that um strong there because uh my friend went to uh drop me there and he could come through 

593.40 598.28 B: you know to the air- airplane they allowed him to go to the airplane 

598.37 599.89 B: i mean sh-
