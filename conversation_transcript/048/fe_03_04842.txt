72.56 73.70 A: (( okay all right oh right right right )) 

73.95 77.86 B: so [laughter] that was not a very 

77.91 81.09 B: good feeling because you're left feeling helpless 

81.93 83.36 B: and not knowing 

83.48 87.77 B: if something is you know still pending what's next 

88.42 91.20 B: you know because the nation's capital of course 

91.22 92.94 B: is a great target 

94.98 97.09 B: so it was a sense of panic 

97.19 101.37 B: all around we weren't able to get around the city 

101.73 102.74 B: at all 

103.02 106.39 B: and i actually was out in maryland when it occurred 

107.14 110.44 B: so it was very difficult for me to get back home 

112.09 115.83 B: quite an adventure but i can honestly say i did not panic 

117.68 121.92 A: (( mm right that's right i see well i i i i don't think i'm really in a a target area you know )) 

122.27 126.43 A: (( what i'm saying so i don't i never really gave it much thought you know what i'm saying yeah yeah )) 

122.71 123.73 B: [laughter] 

125.97 128.39 B: well you're right you're not [laughter] 

128.43 132.08 B: you're kind of a a a a distance from it however 

131.00 134.48 A: (( right if you're in d._c. that's that's where they want to be so yeah mhm right )) 

134.20 135.30 B: yeah 

136.52 137.65 B: yeah 

137.73 140.51 B: well there is the bioterrorism 

141.57 144.42 B: and they could hit where you least expect 

147.73 148.74 B: so 

148.40 153.08 A: right ah so i think they will be going after ah the military bases anyway as something you know right right yeah 

152.17 155.06 B: (( and i'm very close to two of those )) 

156.68 160.53 B: (( [laughter] okay so i guess )) 

158.75 164.04 A: well i i think they're so they're i think they're small in number that they're not really that much of a threat 

164.63 165.86 A: that 

166.72 167.95 B: (( well )) 

167.57 176.53 A: well [mn] they can they they could like they like nine one like nine eleven they did you know they can sneak in and surprise us and 

176.49 177.42 B: right 

177.73 181.34 B: and we are a nation that we quickly forget 

181.97 183.85 B: and our guard is 

184.17 186.26 B: down rather quickly 

184.84 185.80 A: (( kill a few )) 

187.28 189.73 B: because we feel that okay 

189.82 192.66 B: we are in our own territory they're not going to get us here 

193.63 197.05 B: and these are people that are willing to die for their cause 

197.37 198.76 B: (( literally speaking )) 

198.44 199.66 A: (( of us but right down yeah mm )) 

200.05 202.38 A: right right what what is their cause 

202.90 204.07 A: (( that well right okay mm )) 

202.94 205.73 B: well they feel that 

205.96 210.04 B: um they're being sent it's a religious belief 

210.68 213.10 B: to die for their 

213.20 216.56 B: um for their god and that they will be blessed for this 

219.38 223.43 B: and their families are also very well taken care of 

223.92 228.67 B: by the s- by the sacrifices that a lot of these people make 

230.55 236.25 A: so it's all their religion um i know a- a- my god yeah i think they've got the wrong kind of 

236.29 237.51 A: (( what was it maybe both )) 

238.12 239.47 A: currency 

239.76 241.58 A: and greed and things 

242.85 244.66 A: (( like that but mostly religion huh )) 

245.00 246.34 B: yeah 

246.69 247.87 B: yeah 

248.31 250.28 B: that's what they're being taught 

250.81 255.37 B: that you know we are the enemy and we should be taken out 

258.48 264.19 B: and they believe it so therefore they're willing to go to the extent that they went 

264.45 267.23 B: to and are still going to pretty much 

267.57 270.43 B: um on a regular basis 

270.80 274.82 B: they're still doing that in different countries blowing themselves up as well as 

275.00 279.18 B: you know others they're taking out with them so when you're dealing with that type of enemy 

279.94 281.64 B: what is there that you can do 

283.46 287.10 A: [mn] yeah yeah about that yeah [sigh] ah it's like they've ah went to war with them you know

291.19 292.48 B: that's right 

291.72 292.98 A: (( i mean the )) 

293.33 295.28 A: (( you know they have the leaders of it )) 

295.44 296.35 B: right 

296.72 300.84 B: however you have other countries that are allowing the leaders to 

300.69 301.83 A: to yeah 

301.19 304.28 B: escape into their [laughter] country so it's like 

302.30 304.91 A: (( escape in do what they want they're you know )) 

305.03 307.38 B: it's like okay 

305.33 306.45 A: (( help 'em by yeah )) 

308.11 309.57 B: because 

310.36 313.00 B: (( laden is still alive somewhere )) 

315.20 317.42 B: and until they 

317.68 319.09 B: get to him 

319.85 322.78 B: it's going to just continue to happen 

324.15 330.95 B: because it you know as soon as all of this is over he's just going to re- rebuild his troops and 

331.14 333.02 B: get his following rebuilt 

333.35 335.30 B: and try to just keep 

335.39 336.66 B: attacking 

339.31 342.10 B: i don't know what the ultimate goal is but 

343.15 350.25 B: [sigh] i don't know but if they do smaller things nine eleven was really that that was a big thing 

343.92 344.56 A: (( yeah i )) 

349.81 350.78 A: (( think that too )) 

351.05 353.85 B: but all things considered it could have been far worse 

354.88 356.67 A: (( yeah yeah yeah that was a very big thing yeah it )) 

357.15 360.03 A: (( was i think trying to keep them away from nuclear )) 

360.66 361.66 B: pardon me 

361.25 362.13 A: (( area to )) 

362.92 363.57 A: (( you know )) 

363.66 368.03 A: the reason for war really kind of their reason for war really kind of you know 

370.66 373.96 A: i think i- i- it's beyond me 'cause i i really couldn't see 

374.81 378.14 A: over things like that 'cause i i i could see how 

378.51 385.26 A: i know people and i see how you know our system works and what everybody has to do to get by you know 

382.28 383.22 B: right 

385.04 386.00 B: right 

385.60 392.03 A: nobody's really if you lay on your arse you're not going to have anything [laughter] everybody's got to you know do something you know 

388.99 389.97 B: right 

391.50 392.63 B: that's true 

392.36 400.46 A: yeah and it say it's pretty much a you know a a a united nations you know it's a it's a ev- every races here 

400.65 405.09 A: you know so i i really you know have a i really think really small of these people 

405.29 411.08 B: well see the thing is the united states also like to regulate and dictate how others 

411.59 412.68 B: live 

413.86 416.98 B: and they are very rich in resources 

417.64 419.00 B: especially oil 

419.74 428.42 B: and they the dictators over there are living ah you know a lifestyle that is just beyond imagination 

428.66 431.00 A: (( because you know a- a- a- right mm yeah i've seen some of their palaces over )) 

430.95 431.81 B: right 

432.31 434.66 B: you know and and all of this 

435.25 436.46 B: is done 

436.57 439.27 B: and the people are really suffering 

440.04 441.78 B: now in the u._s. 

442.04 443.98 B: you know you may have similar 

444.85 450.00 B: suffering because if you don't have money as you know you won't eat [laughter] 

450.51 454.03 B: but you know we're in the u._s. so you're supposed to be able to get food 

454.30 455.42 B: every day 

455.63 459.85 B: but i think is the normal that society would panic 

459.87 470.51 B: because every time they put it up to orange you know i don't know about anyone else yourself included but i'm always prepared and i 

469.49 471.15 A: (( there yeah they've got some )) 

470.53 472.88 B: always make sure that i have 

473.10 474.24 B: water 

475.15 476.75 B: canned goods 

477.22 479.46 B: at all times because you never know 

480.60 485.49 B: and that's just a precaution because they have threatened our food system 

486.20 489.59 B: and they have nothing to lose 

489.43 492.77 A: (( yeah right right yeah mm right i think that's yeah dangerous and that someone )) 

490.98 497.54 B: they have absolutely nothing to lose and all that they have to do is say hey 

495.59 496.66 A: (( has nothing to lose )) 

498.80 500.79 B: the food is contaminated 

500.94 503.10 B: and then you see mass panic 

503.24 508.08 B: and you know i just know people are prone to do it if you look at when they say snow 

509.50 513.86 B: at least in this area you can't find bread and milk [laughter] 

513.79 515.78 A: (( you know yeah yeah yeah )) 

515.54 517.76 B: so you know it's like so 

516.75 523.44 A: yeah that's this is you know it's it's not on their mind they forget you know you forget about that nine eleven was what was 

525.11 527.45 B: yeah i think a lot of people panic 

528.37 531.25 B: and i think that if something were to 

531.31 534.89 B: occur again that we also would have 

534.91 536.70 B: a lot of panic 

537.29 538.77 A: (( it two years yeah yeah yeah they are yeah i )) 

538.92 544.28 A: think too ah myself i don't i don't think i would panic too much i i know what to do and and 

544.31 546.15 A: where shelters are and 

546.52 547.48 B: right 

547.74 553.04 B: well i guess it also would depend on depend upon where it takes place 

547.75 549.91 A: (( things like that there there again like i would then again mm mm )) 

553.47 562.86 B: if you're relatively in a safety zone so to speak it may not impact you [laughter] you know to the same extent as it did the people in new york 

562.99 564.51 A: (( right mm okay oh right )) 

564.35 567.35 B: or the people you know right here in d._c. 

567.40 570.98 B: or even the people that were in pennsylvania where the plane 

571.09 573.73 B: you know where you know they had it go down 

574.00 574.86 B: so 

575.56 578.12 B: i guess it just depends on 

578.26 580.74 B: you know and and you know you know yourself 

581.07 585.12 B: i'm a person that may originally panic [laughter] 

585.14 590.39 B: and then evaluate because i'm analytical so i'll evaluate the situation and then 

590.49 595.76 B: proceed from there but my initial reaction may be one of panic [laughter] 

595.85 598.40 B: till i pull it back together and say hey [laughter] 

598.99 599.95 B: this is what
