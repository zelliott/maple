0.72 2.78 A: hi my name's austin 

2.35 5.29 B: hi austin my name is brett how are you 

5.12 6.78 A: i'm doing well 

6.44 14.51 B: good good i guess they want to know if we'd panic if we were in a terr- ju- in the middle of a terrorist attack 

14.11 18.23 A: [laughter] oh well well i guess 

17.11 19.48 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

18.98 26.80 A: well i guess first of all we have to define what a terrorist attack is and then we have to define what panic means [laughter] 

26.72 33.57 B: yeah 'cause um my thinking is generally you don't know what kind of attack it is at the time 

33.04 34.93 A: right 

33.82 37.16 B: i mean if you're sitting at your desk and a plane comes through your window 

37.64 41.29 B: basically you don't have a whole lot of chance to really think about anything 

40.84 43.25 A: right 

41.84 48.22 B: so but at the same time it's like a ah something blows up next to you and the building shakes 

48.30 52.59 B: you're not sure what it is so do you panic or do you just leave 

52.29 53.70 A: you just leave 

54.05 55.17 B: yeah 

55.49 57.02 A: yeah it's it's 

57.34 62.92 A: ah it's kind of like our our town had a a big major fire 

63.21 65.13 A: ah a few years ago 

65.79 67.52 A: and you know 

67.57 77.13 A: there was that nervousness that uncertainty ah do we need to evacuate ah you know what's going to happen what do we need to do 

77.46 80.24 A: and you know 

82.43 85.87 A: we've got a disaster in in in progress 

85.92 87.17 A: but ah 

89.24 99.64 A: i don't think anybody really panicked people got a little excited and very concerned but it was like okay what are we going to do and how do we organize it and let's get it done 

99.85 104.32 B: yeah i think i think it it al- also depends on the nature of the event 

104.28 106.39 A: right 

104.92 110.24 B: you know if if things are blowing up around you you'd you're going to tend to probably 

111.17 114.01 B: whether it's panic or just um 

114.98 118.15 B: more active response ah 

119.36 123.59 B: you know th- th- there'll be b- more based on what happens 

124.20 126.22 B: i think if if yes if 

126.78 137.32 B: things are blowing up around me and the floors are caving in i think i'm going to respond differently than if the building shakes and [noise] there's just one explosion next to me or something 

136.43 138.87 A: right 

139.09 140.39 B: yeah 

140.73 150.15 A: but you know it's like a terrorist attack they're you're on a airplane and people are waving guns around 

149.39 150.51 B: right 

150.54 155.53 A: well why does panic look like that like them does it mean that you're 

156.69 160.52 A: shut up [laughter] and pay attention and do what they ask you to do 

160.92 165.38 B: yeah 'cause i'm thinking you don't want 'em shooting at us out of a plane 

164.99 173.27 A: right [laughter] which is not a panic reaction is more like a okay 

173.40 175.34 A: what do i need to do to survive 

175.26 189.43 B: right and i and i guess that's that's a that's a good point 'cause it's like is it a panicking or is it what is it you do to survive when you find when you start realising that there is danger of some type 

189.57 191.38 A: exactly 

190.61 195.34 B: i i've been in a situation where i've been underwater in a truck and 

195.49 199.46 B: basically it was the whole idea of if i panic i'm dead it 

198.93 200.90 A: (( [noise] exactly )) 

199.80 201.88 B: gave me a lot of motivation not to panic 

202.02 204.19 A: a lot of motivation [noise] 

204.18 205.30 B: (( oh )) 

206.81 208.41 A: how did you get out 

208.49 211.54 B: um as i found out 

212.04 217.42 B: i was i i i i'd and as it we were going coming over a bridge 

217.44 222.22 B: and the road gave out and we but but the water was already even with the road 

221.64 223.73 A: yeah 

222.24 233.37 B: and the producer that was with me said brett we're in the water and i was like oh and my hand just went right for the electrical controls 'cause we're in a isuzu trooper 

233.13 235.17 A: right 

233.73 236.11 B: so we roll down the i roll down the window 

236.68 242.76 B: and then just unlocked the door and about the time that the water came over the windshield 

243.03 244.25 B: the um 

244.46 246.42 B: the electrical system went out 

246.70 249.66 B: so the good thing was the windows were already down 

249.26 251.25 A: right 

249.84 251.52 B: and the doors were already unlocked 

251.63 252.80 A: great 

252.87 256.17 B: and that whole thing about waiting for the thing to get you know 

256.30 258.33 B: the car fill up with water 

258.51 260.07 B: not a smart move 

259.88 262.79 A: (( [laughter] )) 

262.41 268.89 B: i mean it kind of defies like the sen- the the the basic laws of logic geometry and everything else you're 

267.00 270.42 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

269.11 274.50 B: never as close to solid land as you are when you first realise that you're in the [laughter] water 

273.94 281.27 A: yeah [laughter] your chances of getting back [laughter] are better from that point backwards 

274.84 276.62 B: [laughter] 

280.92 282.53 B: and they diminish 

282.34 284.56 A: exactly 

285.25 286.55 A: wow 

286.34 287.65 B: yeah so 

287.78 296.52 B: and and i and i think that it's kind of like the same thing for like a and it like if it'd been an attack i've been in i work for t._v. news 

296.82 301.66 B: and there've been things that have happened that you don't know what's going on like it was before we had all this 

302.13 307.59 B: story about terrorism but you don't know how bad it is or what it is until 

307.95 309.08 B: later 

309.26 311.77 B: you know if there's fires it's kind of like 

310.02 313.18 A: (( mhm )) 

312.14 314.63 B: at your window or something you don't know 

314.68 323.09 B: some who set on set the building on fire but you really don't care you just want to find find a way to get out it's like you said you want to survive 

320.09 322.29 A: (( well right )) 

322.82 326.06 A: (( you're right )) 

327.80 334.65 B: mm so i i don't know i mean that's a kind of a tricky question but would you panic during a terrorist attack 

335.16 338.79 B: 'cause like you said the first we have to define panic 

338.99 340.62 B: and the other thing is 

340.90 343.02 B: how do you know it's a terrorist attack 

344.03 350.94 A: yeah i mean 'cause it's it's like people are walking down the streets waving guns 

352.32 353.26 B: yeah 

352.51 367.21 A: the first thing i would think oh they're shooting a movie [laughter] and of course i would get out of the way but as soon as i could determine that oh no we've got some bad guys here 

355.65 357.10 B: [laughter] 

367.44 368.84 A: (( ah [mn] )) 

370.13 372.38 A: okay well what can i do 

372.67 374.08 A: to you know 

375.21 379.12 A: take care of myself and to to get some help 

378.82 386.04 B: yeah and it's like if people are r- running out like it was like you said it's like a it's like a movie oh what are they shooting i 

384.80 387.65 A: yeah [laughter] 

387.70 390.20 B: mean because we're so conditioned for that 

389.57 392.13 A: (( yeah right )) 

391.55 392.30 B: (( mm )) 

392.88 394.16 B: that's amazing 

394.22 397.61 B: because it's like the whole coun- now let me ask you this what part of the country are you in 

397.44 398.94 A: i'm in california 

399.17 405.37 B: okay are you like in a city or are you like in a in like a sub- ah suburb type area 

404.46 411.80 A: well it's it's more like a little village a little tourist trap called laguna beach right on the pacific ocean 

411.43 413.73 B: (( okay yeah i've heard of it )) 

413.41 415.59 A: yeah 

414.28 416.99 B: yeah because i'm in north carolina i'm in durham 

416.90 417.92 A: oh 

417.38 423.08 B: i'm thinking that we're probably not in areas that are real prone to 

424.65 427.65 B: something that we could really be in a terrorist attack 

428.80 431.51 B: you know i d- i just don't see them saying you know 

429.11 429.72 A: (( mm )) 

432.77 434.16 B: um 

434.65 437.68 B: we need to go to durham and like bomb it 

437.60 439.55 A: right 

438.18 441.49 B: and we'll get a couple at universities and stuff 

440.92 443.27 A: yeah 

443.57 444.42 B: so 

444.83 450.06 B: but then we have been told that they would target us because of the nuclear power plant nearby 

451.72 454.28 B: so it does kind of change things a little bit 

453.43 459.38 A: [laughter] right right but they'd be bombing the power plant 

459.31 461.13 B: right 

461.50 465.67 B: so i don't know it's like it's just one of those funny things like you don't you 

465.82 474.71 B: well by the mere nature that it's terrorism it's surprise and it's designed to shake people up and confuse people 

470.49 472.32 A: right 

474.99 476.63 A: right 

475.86 481.57 B: so you're not going to know where it's going to be but it kind of goes back to the original thing 

481.23 483.22 A: yeah 

481.76 484.23 B: what is panic and what is 

484.65 487.79 B: you know what would we be in the terrorist attack 

487.45 494.86 A: yeah well what was it ah winston churchill said nothin focuses the mind like a p- 

495.27 501.31 A: like a bullet [laughter] ah or gun aimed in your direction 

501.18 502.31 B: yeah 

501.74 506.61 A: you get very very clear very very focused [laughter] in that moment 

506.79 507.90 B: that's true 

507.72 511.53 A: yeah 'cause i can remember ah in my days as a fireman 

511.85 513.44 A: you know it's it 

514.81 521.65 A: when the situation is dangerous there's no telling what you'll do or or think of or 

522.06 530.04 A: w- wonder what possessed you you know when you're looking at it afterwards you just respond 

530.87 532.62 B: right 

533.06 539.47 B: yeah 'cause firemen have to like you guys like purposely walk into situations where other people are running from 

539.25 540.40 A: right 

541.07 541.87 B: and that's 

541.12 547.81 A: and you've had your training and all of that but you you don't know what you're walking into whether they've you know 

548.50 555.36 A: hacked up sawed up the floor or whether you know you don't know what you're walking into but ah 

556.00 560.25 A: you know as soon as ah you find out that there's supposed to be a 

560.35 562.75 A: a child in there 

563.91 571.43 A: even though you pride yourself on not being a hero there you go acting like some heroic fool or something doing [laughter] 

566.82 567.78 B: uh-huh 

571.04 573.35 B: yeah but you guys see it as doing your job 

573.18 575.30 A: yeah 

573.87 578.03 B: you know you guys like it's not being a hero it's just that's what you were paid to do yeah 

577.72 580.44 A: exactly 

580.81 585.59 B: which makes you a hero in certain instances but that's not your goal 

585.21 599.65 A: no [laughter] your goal is to do as little as possible and collect the pay check [laughter] yeah it's like yeah but and i'm sure with all those firemen in new york 

590.71 593.70 B: [laughter] like the rest of the world
