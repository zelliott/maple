24.84 25.72 B: are you 

29.37 35.08 A: yeah i mean i think uh i don't know which state one of the states i think phil- i think pennsylvania

43.38 46.90 A: in bars or something i thin- i don't think you can smoke in bars 

46.61 49.65 B: no that's uh new york city just did that actually 

49.18 51.20 A: (( new york city i thought it was pennsylvania )) 

50.28 51.30 B: yeah they 

51.41 54.72 B: no not that i'm aware of i know california had that 

54.85 63.22 B: for quite some time when i was out there you weren't you weren't allowed to and then new york city just passed a i don't think pennsylvania passed it yet 

56.64 58.36 A: (( mhm )) 

63.21 64.03 A: okay 

64.09 65.14 B: (( i don't know )) 

65.22 68.38 B: it it might be not not that i'm aware at least 

68.41 69.94 B: (( 'cause i live in jersey )) 

70.08 71.89 A: yeah i'm from jersey [noise] 

71.92 72.79 B: oh really 

72.68 76.91 A: yeah i'm in virginia now but i'm i'm from there 

77.77 78.61 B: cool 

78.16 83.64 A: but uh yeah i mean you know since we're both [laughter] since we either of us smoke you know it's 

83.97 97.69 A: we're obviously going to be totally for that but i mean i mean even even people who do smoke i mean i don't think they'd be opposed to that in the sense that you know people who aren't smoking are gonna be exposed to second hand smoke and things like that 

87.59 89.80 B: yeah i definitely i mean 

97.50 98.96 B: right right 

98.80 99.36 A: (( [mn] )) 

99.42 100.91 A: right um 

101.69 107.44 A: i don't know that's a great idea it sucks because a lot of people i know you know who are smokers they 

108.06 109.33 A: you know they look at 

109.48 121.56 A: things and you know public areas like bowling alleys and and things like that activities like that where they grab a beer they're they always say that when having a beer or drinks or something like that it goes hand in hand with smoking 

121.52 125.05 A: you know it's sort of it tastes good while you smoke or something like that i don't know 

121.58 122.73 B: (( yeah yeah well it's )) 

124.76 126.75 B: a social activity 

126.86 135.42 A: right so it i don't know i don't know if it's really interesting to see if it's gonna increase the revenue for the um 

135.70 144.22 A: you know for those places or is it gonna decrease it you know are are more people gonna go because it doesn't smell smoky any more or or are less people gonna go 'cause they can't smoke you know 

144.17 147.64 B: i i don't think you will i don't i think you're gonna see less people go 

147.63 148.66 A: you think so 

148.64 152.49 B: yeah i don't think that people will be drawn to it 

152.89 161.27 B: you're in a type of crowd that's gonna go out and not not really care too much you may not like it but you deal with it but i think some smokers would feel 

158.89 159.71 A: right 

162.37 165.60 B: (( i don't know i think they they'll they'll avoid it or they won't )) 

166.29 173.47 A: you don't think they'd mind going and just doing the activity and then just stepping outside for a for a smoke then come back in 

177.66 178.54 A: hello 

182.23 183.64 A: are you still there 

194.79 196.35 A: are you still there 

200.16 202.91 A: (( i don't know if you can hear me but i can't hear you at all )) 

205.82 206.63 A: (( mm )) 

209.31 212.61 A: i'm not sure if you you can hear me or if you're if 

213.63 217.20 A: you have caller i._d. or call waiting or something and maybe you're using it 

218.45 220.41 A: i'm not sure but 

246.49 249.65 A: i'm pretty sure that your that your phone is still 

249.70 254.76 A: on the line because my phone is still recording the fact that i'm i'm on the line with somebody 

256.53 257.49 A: so 

267.56 271.98 A: i guess to just continue the conversation i should just keep talking as though 

272.12 273.91 A: pretending that you're there 

274.07 276.52 A: you know you might be able to hear me i have no idea 

277.46 278.50 A: um 

279.35 282.64 A: i guess i can just continue the dialogue by myself 

283.25 284.30 A: (( all right )) 

285.22 287.05 A: um 

287.27 289.16 A: i don't know what country it is but there's 

289.60 293.31 A: there's some foreign country has like you know pictures of like diseased 

293.48 303.52 A: parts and or sorry lungs and organs uh you know throats and things like that that you get from all the the crap that's in 

303.64 304.49 A: uh 

304.81 312.95 A: cigarettes all accumulating after awhile and they put they put those on cigarettes when they sell them as sort of a constant reminder 

313.53 314.47 A: that 

314.54 319.95 A: you know you're buying you're buying a uh product that is just horrendous for you 

320.60 325.09 A: and that's something they don't do in this country which you know i i don't know i think 

325.38 328.44 A: i think that would definitely have a a decent impact 

329.54 330.66 A: you know on 

330.71 332.19 A: on some people here 

332.30 334.14 A: you know it would hit home more 

334.33 338.37 A: i'm su- i mean there's there have been some anti drug campaigns on t._v. 

338.54 345.92 A: uh you know were they they show some pictures of lungs and and stuff that are just chewed up 

346.17 347.53 A: from the smoke 

348.56 350.33 A: but 

350.78 352.28 A: it uh 

354.23 357.43 A: you know it'll be more of an impact if it's actually on the cigarettes 

358.15 361.51 A: because it'll be a direct impact to the consumers 

362.05 370.45 A: versus a you know if it's on t._v. not everybody's gonna see the ad and it's not going to be as widespread and the impact won't be as great 

371.35 377.19 A: so i think it's definitely a better impact if it's if it's like that but every any any kind of you know is 

377.46 379.28 A: obviously good yeah 

379.77 380.72 A: um 

380.83 383.33 A: we've just got to try to do something that is 

383.54 388.75 A: that you can target everybody and if you do things on t._v. it's not going to target everybody 

389.33 390.29 A: so 

390.51 396.02 A: putting things on directly on cigarettes will be probably the best way you can do that 

396.10 400.80 A: so that's something they haven't done yet in this country which i think is you know they should seriously consider 

404.27 405.18 A: um 

406.76 410.42 A: you know what can i say smoking is is terrible you know they 

411.10 415.01 A: uh you know like you know a little younger 

416.24 425.19 A: you know whatever twelve thirteen you stick right around and you find cigarettes and you know at that point you just doing it 'cause it's cool there's no other reason 

425.74 431.80 A: and uh you know just a couple of times but you know eventually when you go and you're not you know it's just disgusting 

433.75 434.65 A: so 

437.32 445.65 A: it's your own determination really and some people start off because of school and they realize they get a buzz or they feel and they feel less 

445.98 456.17 A: you know nervous and and you know calmer if they if they get that you know the stuff that's in a cigarette to uh calm them down and 

456.31 460.80 A: but it it stinks 'cause they they pay a price for it so 

461.55 465.30 A: i really wish that those people found a different way to 

465.89 468.40 A: to get the positive affects of the cigarettes 

468.63 471.64 A: without destroying their lungs by by doing that 

472.88 473.92 A: um 

477.02 478.06 A: but 

479.76 485.08 A: yeah everybody has their own way of dealing with things and a lot of people deal with it with cigarettes 

485.81 490.73 A: and you it's our our job to try to save as many lives as we can 

490.95 497.17 A: or not our job but politicians and law makers and and such 

498.55 499.66 A: you know and 

499.77 505.05 A: any kind of campaign that can touch the lives of you know of many people 

506.06 518.04 A: you know it's i don't know what the statistics are as far as smoking is concerned but the types of ads that we've had campaigns and and increasing or decreasing numbers of smoking in this country are i'm not sure 

518.64 523.08 A: but you know i'm i can't i can't speak for all these politicians 

523.76 529.31 A: but whatever the trend is you know i'm sure they're i'm sure people are are going ahead and 

531.38 534.07 A: making campaigns that are 

534.90 536.42 A: going to be effective 

538.45 541.81 A: and it's really hard talking about smoking when there's no one else helping 

541.98 542.97 A: to talk 

543.15 545.03 A: back to respond 

545.33 547.26 A: i don't even know if this is gonna count 

549.01 549.83 A: in 

550.81 552.46 A: almost eleven minutes 

553.55 555.61 A: there may be some glitch 

556.10 557.47 A: in the uh 

557.74 559.10 A: system 

561.24 567.18 A: i'm going to hold for another minute and if it goes beyond twelve i'm sure there's some problem so 

568.55 570.45 A: (( although it looks as though there is a problem )) 

582.55 583.28 A: (( [noise] ))
