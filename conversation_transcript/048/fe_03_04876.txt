7.03 8.51 B: [laughter] oh pretty good [sigh] 

9.47 13.87 B: so what do you think about those trials should they be on t._v. or not [sigh] 

9.70 10.68 A: um 

13.64 25.93 A: [noise] ah i don't personally have a problem with it it's not something that i take any interest in i mean ah the the way i kinda look at things in terms of ah t._v. and radio and so forth if it's you know if you don't like it just turn it off 

18.67 19.56 B: mhm 

25.39 28.33 B: right exactly that's that's how i feel [sigh] 

28.39 34.11 B: i mean if you don't ah if you don't like something that they're showing at that moment you know just turn the channel [laughter] 

33.96 35.93 A: [sigh] right [sigh] 

35.12 44.39 B: [sigh] but ah as far as um [lipsmack] i dunno as far as those criminal trials i think they get a bit a little bit too much publicity anyways [noise] 

44.96 45.87 B: i mean 

44.97 46.51 A: [sigh] yeah i mean the thing is 

46.39 57.40 A: it's not like ah you know i [laughter] i don't mean to be silly about it like in an american idol where people are watching and they're calling to vote on it the people who ultimately make the decision are the jury 

53.03 53.75 B: mhm 

56.90 58.13 B: (( [mn] uh huh mhm )) 

57.38 69.43 A: and i dunno how much the jury gets affected by it being ah televised especially if they're in a situation where they're sequestered or something and you know they don't know what's going on in the public opinion [sigh] 

68.33 69.73 B: mhm 

70.57 72.51 B: yeah where are you from

83.41 90.54 A: mhm you know well it's it's been pretty miserable here it's raining [laughter] yeah 

88.18 89.66 B: oh really 

89.75 90.81 B: wow 

92.39 97.82 B: [noise] mm well it's ah it's been kinda mild here it's just in the low seventies [sigh] 

97.10 99.43 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

98.85 100.96 B: not very not much [sigh] 

102.37 110.50 A: yeah i guess you don't have to worry about rain in southern california after like about the middle about this time of year once it gets past april it doesn't really rain any more 

109.98 113.93 B: not like uh-huh you're right about that actually we haven't seen rain since ah 

111.00 113.25 A: mhm 

114.34 121.47 B: [sigh] ah march i think it was march or february [lipsmack] was the last time we've seen any rain around but [sigh] but ah [sigh] 

122.51 129.73 A: mhm well speaking of southern california i mean like that was where the o. j. trial was i mean that was probably one of the most publicized 

129.06 135.83 B: oh yeah that was a really high profile trial it was televised ah like mad [sigh] 

131.95 135.82 A: mhm 

135.99 140.62 B: it was ah that's that's one case that's one example actually 

140.33 142.15 A: mhm 

140.76 147.27 B: [sigh] um of high profile cases and being you know [noise] televised 

146.89 148.52 A: yeah i dunno if it had enough 

147.43 148.25 B: (( i )) 

148.89 153.27 B: it kinda like it was like too much you know it was just [sigh] 

153.29 159.01 B: i mean it just got out of hand and it just shows you what they shouldn't do [sigh] 

158.08 160.75 A: mhm 

159.32 166.43 B: just televise it too much and make a big deal out of [sigh] something too much over the t._v. because people get caught up in it 

163.82 164.53 A: (( [noise] )) 

166.44 169.66 B: and then all of a sudden you find that ah 

169.82 178.37 B: [mn] [laughter] people are starting to judge people and you know it's like a back and forth war [laughter] almost but ah 

178.96 182.84 B: it kinda kinda got out of hand here in l. a. [sigh] 

181.02 183.40 A: mhm 

183.37 192.63 A: [noise] i dunno it made it um you know worse for the jury and for o. j. himself you know and then he got a better verdict or you know 

192.48 206.54 A: wh- how you look at it if that trial had been not televised would the verdict have come out differently i guess i guess that's my whole thing with it i don't think it would have [sigh] mhm 

196.20 197.11 B: mhm 

198.38 199.30 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

203.53 207.30 B: see i i i ki- i dunno i kinda have a little bit of a different opinion 

207.81 210.82 B: i think maybe he could have maybe been 

210.94 213.19 B: if convicted if [sigh] 

213.89 219.01 B: i think if um [sigh] if it wasn't televised so much 

218.67 220.38 A: mhm 

219.86 233.41 B: or if it wasn't televised period i think it would have been a different outlook on it i mean we wouldn't even had all that commotion [laughter] that went on here afterwards if it wasn't televised on t._v. you know 

220.85 221.44 A: (( yeah )) 

228.23 230.21 A: mhm 

230.38 231.01 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

233.43 235.23 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

235.99 238.03 B: (( [noise] but )) 

238.06 243.26 B: ah but that just shows i mean sometimes maybe you shouldn't you shouldn't ah televise ah 

243.73 249.91 B: certain trials maybe high profiled trials like that like actors and actresses and stuff 

244.02 247.00 A: mhm 

249.62 257.25 A: [noise] mhm [noise] yeah they're talking about it around here i i live in the area where those sniper shootings were taking place last fall 

256.96 258.23 B: oh yes yes 

257.84 267.36 A: and so they're ah getting ready to put those guys on trial and they've talked about that in reference to that you know televising those trials and so forth 

267.20 268.83 B: (( mhm mm i see )) 

269.13 270.45 B: yeah 

270.88 273.93 B: [sigh] yep yep yep [sigh] but ah 

275.12 281.17 A: you know another weird thing that gets televised and this i guess it's true out in southern california is like police chases 

280.83 283.88 B: mhm oh all the time 

281.64 287.28 A: somebody will be in their car yeah they interrupt re- [laughter] 

283.89 295.80 B: all the time as a matter of fact speaking of police chases i just seen one the other day [laughter] because it's tel- they're televised here constantly every time there's one i mean they televise them 

289.61 290.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

295.83 297.77 A: mhm that's something 

296.41 302.39 B: and they're trying they're trying to get them to you know actually not [laughter] televise them any more [sigh] so 

301.83 304.01 A: mhm 

304.13 306.96 A: it's not really something you see on the east coast very much 

307.22 316.72 A: i guess i mean we do have car chases but for whatever reason the t._v. stations yeah i guess maybe the t._v. stations aren't operating helicopters as much or something 

310.17 312.64 B: but but you don't see them on t._v. too much 

317.15 323.31 B: mhm yeah it's almost like there's a spotlight on l. a. [laughter] [laughter] ah 

320.31 322.19 A: mhm 

323.36 326.30 B: i dunno it's just the media's crazy here 

324.47 325.90 A: well i mean 

326.27 331.84 A: yeah i guess it's just a off shoot you know with all the movie and t._v. industry i guess it just kinda 

326.50 327.81 B: (( uh-huh yep )) 

332.00 335.71 A: ah in you know [mn] captivates everything else [noise] 

337.57 338.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

339.44 340.91 B: (( yeah i mean ah [sigh] )) 

342.97 345.32 B: (( ah well [laughter] )) 

345.90 347.97 B: i mean as far as ah [sigh] 

350.48 353.13 B: what else is the subject about televising 

353.52 355.38 B: the trials and 

356.47 359.52 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i can't remember if there were two parts or one part 

358.21 362.63 B: there was two parts but i can't [laughter] remember exactly what the other one was [laughter] 

361.84 364.05 A: mhm [sigh] no 

364.79 369.94 A: i guess we don't uh disagree enough to really argue it through i mean i guess we're kinda of the same 

368.57 373.34 B: no i think we're pretty neutral as far as our opinions are you know [laughter] 

370.35 373.15 A: yeah mhm 

374.06 375.81 A: yeah 

376.13 383.62 A: i'm trying to think of any other ah high publicity trials that are going on right now or coming up 

380.36 381.21 B: oh 

381.94 384.17 B: well there was one [sigh] 

384.21 388.59 B: that ended i guess a couple of months ago it was robert downey junior [sigh] 

388.53 389.99 A: yeah mhm 

389.34 396.29 B: and [laughter] actually i used to know him out of all people i went to school with him 

392.84 394.61 A: mhm 

396.23 398.01 A: mhm 

396.68 409.14 B: um at a local high school here in santa monica [noise] where a lot of ah people went to school here um like a lot of actors and actresses went to school there because ah they were transferred from malibu 

405.34 406.46 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

409.26 410.85 B: to santa monica high 

409.30 410.99 A: yeah 

410.94 415.78 B: so i went to school with ah a few a few of the actors that you know now [sigh] 

415.89 417.39 A: mhm 

416.14 417.24 B: (( and ah )) 

417.88 421.33 B: he was kind of a strange kid back then [laughter] 

421.16 423.08 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

422.26 423.47 B: i remember him 

424.90 428.01 B: ah kinda highed up on drugs back then [laughter] 

427.83 428.74 A: uh-huh 

429.34 434.81 B: [noise] he used to smoke a lot of weed but he was very intelligent [noise] at the same time 

435.49 437.21 B: very articulate [sigh] [sigh] 

435.79 436.44 A: (( mm )) 

437.54 441.92 A: guess the only other one i can think of is winona ryder sure with her shoplifting 

441.66 447.56 B: oh yes yes yes yes at the sax fifth avenue in beverly hills 

445.83 447.51 A: mhm 

447.76 449.28 B: (( yeah i don't yeah i don't )) 

448.44 451.45 A: and that and i guess i guess 

450.51 452.05 B: what do you think about that yeah mhm 

452.22 453.30 A: um 

453.90 468.69 A: i i felt a little bit strange about that because that was a seemed like a little bit more personal um i mean it was a criminal trial but it seemed more like a a civil trial in some ways because it was like delving more into her personal problems and so forth 

468.16 469.34 B: right 

468.72 475.14 A: i felt like more like a what you would see if you were watching somebody who was getting a divorce or something i dunno 

474.48 477.01 B: yeah did kinda get that feel to it 

477.21 479.08 B: it kinda had that feel to it [sigh] 

479.31 492.07 A: 'cause with the o. j. trial it was more about you know science you know d._n._a. evidence and whether the c- cops tainted the evidence you know whether the cops were crooked and so forth so there was so much going on 

492.02 496.68 A: but winona was the only one who was really on trial kinda in that tr- 

495.48 496.76 B: (( mhm right )) 

497.21 498.55 A: situation 

497.66 504.33 B: right i just don't know what she was thinking [laughter] when she did that [laughter] what the hell was she thinking 

502.07 502.85 A: mhm 

503.95 510.17 A: yeah i i guess that was some kinda cry for help or something i'm sure she could have paid for it 

508.69 513.23 B: [laughter] i mean i don't i don't even really think she stole that stuff 

513.45 517.80 B: i mean i think she had the money to actually pay for that stuff that she stole 

517.62 518.73 A: mhm 

518.11 522.52 B: but i think she was doing it for other reasons don't you think so 

521.22 521.87 A: yeah 

522.35 524.34 A: yeah maybe to get attention 

524.42 526.88 B: yeah maybe attention maybe for 

524.66 525.56 A: i don't 

527.05 530.05 B: somebody else i don't know [laughter] [noise] 

528.88 532.73 A: yeah how many movies do ya have to be in to get enough attention [laughter] 

532.11 534.69 B: yeah just doesn't seem right [laughter] 

536.98 538.07 B: (( but ah i )) 

537.53 541.79 A: what's going on with the robert blake trial i haven't heard anything about that recently 

540.90 544.85 B: [noise] haven't heard anything about that recently um [mn] 

545.34 550.72 B: i that's really funny i haven't heard anything about that in i guess the last three or four weeks 

550.46 552.40 A: mhm 

551.33 553.24 B: i dunno what's going on with that 

554.12 556.84 B: i think he was out on bail for a while 

556.48 558.27 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

557.41 564.90 B: i don't know what happened after that i don't know if he's back in jail or is he still out or what but ah [lipsmack] 

566.69 569.38 B: i dunno what's going on that's another pretty high 

569.65 571.21 B: profile trial 

571.67 577.93 A: [noise] yeah well it's getting some national coverage and i haven't he- heard anything so i dunno i thought maybe in l. a. maybe it would be bigger 

577.87 579.06 B: (( yeah yep )) 

578.14 578.70 A: (( [sigh] )) 

581.83 585.54 B: [sigh] but ah [sigh] i think he might have done that [sigh] 

582.20 582.92 A: (( mhm )) 

584.66 586.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

586.27 589.83 B: 'cause um the way they're describing it and everything is just 

592.97 599.95 A: yeah i i c- can't remember the whole scenario but he'd left his supposedly left the gun on the table in the restaurant or something 

599.55 599.89 B: (( ah mm ))
