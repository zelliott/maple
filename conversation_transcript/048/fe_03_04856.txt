0.49 2.36 A: (( hi this is rocko )) 

2.42 4.46 B: hi this is brenda 

4.54 5.76 A: (( how ya doing brenda )) 

4.58 5.95 B: how are you 

5.82 7.45 A: i'm good yourself 

7.29 12.62 B: uh fine how do you think you would react during a terrorist attack 

12.90 21.37 A: uh i think i'd remain calm but i think um most people depending on the geographical location would probably panic 

21.94 23.84 A: um given 

24.50 33.06 A: given the uncertainty but i think uh you'd have to define the situation and and define where you're at when it happened 

33.38 34.52 B: [mn] that 

33.57 35.92 A: how about yourself how would you react 

36.31 42.19 B: [lipsmack] i probably would panic but try to remain calm 

41.66 43.10 A: yeah 

43.37 45.18 B: what state are you in 

44.89 46.38 A: california 

46.04 48.34 B: oh i'm in north carolina 

47.97 49.32 A: oh okay 

49.36 50.00 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

49.49 50.42 A: we're 

50.74 56.12 A: we're both both near the water so it's possible for something like that to happen 

50.86 51.66 B: yeah 

52.86 53.42 B: (( [mn] )) 

56.26 57.69 B: yes 

57.15 58.68 A: yeah 

58.38 62.60 B: like you said i think it would depend on the situation 

62.71 63.74 B: um 

64.80 66.58 B: (( [lipsmack] i think uh )) 

66.61 75.18 B: something i would be most afraid of would be something like well we're near uh not too far from a nuclear power plant 

74.97 76.43 A: (( mm )) 

76.00 78.13 B: and i really don't know 

79.11 85.53 B: what effect maybe fifty sixty miles what effect that would have on us 

85.51 87.10 A: right 

85.77 92.22 B: if they were hit nobody's really told us they give out pills for those who live 

92.43 95.84 B: uh about ten miles from them but 

95.28 96.40 A: (( [laughter] really )) 

96.09 97.61 B: for here 

97.32 99.24 A: pills what kind of pills 

98.50 104.39 B: uh some kind of potassium pills that helps protect the thyroid 

104.75 106.40 A: (( oh man )) 

104.85 108.44 B: from thyroid cancer but but you know that 

108.46 110.47 B: that's all it would do 

109.98 111.26 A: uh-huh 

111.87 113.27 B: but uh 

114.47 119.62 B: i don't i don't think they tell us everything [laughter] 

114.75 115.53 A: wow 

120.23 124.80 B: but uh i really don't know what i would do in that situation 

120.36 121.61 A: (( right )) 

125.20 134.02 A: yeah well most uh considering there would probably a a loud boom and a something blowing up um [lipsmack] 

134.20 137.55 A: there may not be much you can do i think i think 

137.00 138.37 B: right 

137.68 142.16 A: people generally shock is the first reaction 

142.63 145.59 A: and uh if you're 

146.05 158.08 A: the the scenario of the world trade center okay if you're you're up on the thirtieth floor and and there's a fireball coming after you uh you'd probably panic or you know 

157.46 163.50 B: oh i don't think you could help it but you would try to keep your wits about you and do what you could 

159.64 161.22 A: (( you could help yeah )) 

163.00 171.36 A: exactly so it depends but with all the fair warning we have now i think people are more prepared like logically 

171.48 173.22 A: for something to happen 

173.49 177.97 A: because it it's happening and and so on and so forth i mean 

178.42 183.38 A: it's i think the people in israel uh most expect it now 

183.40 188.26 A: in certain places and they're they're they're at least psychologically prepared 

188.35 192.01 A: if not physically prepared for something like that to happen y- 

191.17 197.48 B: i guess you do get used to it but it would be horrible living like that 

197.25 198.72 A: (( yeah )) 

197.52 199.68 B: that you have no choice 

199.23 202.03 A: (( very unsettling um )) 

202.43 205.92 A: hopefully it will all come to an end but i doubt it 

204.64 206.62 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

206.01 209.21 A: it'll get worse before it gets better and um mhm 

207.70 210.65 B: i think one thing i'm uh 

211.11 216.50 B: maybe concerned about is the spread of diseases i've read a lot about 

216.86 223.07 B: smallpox and i think that would be about the one of the worst diseases anybody could get 

222.99 228.99 A: yeah that would be bad did you have vaccination for that though people can be vaccinated against that 

228.26 232.25 B: well they've found out now that it's hurting uh 

232.34 233.82 B: people's hearts 

234.02 235.57 B: older people 

234.24 236.32 A: oh oh is that right 

236.09 237.40 B: (( [lipsmack] yes )) 

237.49 245.18 B: i had one when i was younger but it's worn off but it's uh damaging some people's hearts and so 

244.85 246.84 A: mhm the vaccination is 

246.46 247.84 B: yes 

247.43 248.74 A: really 

248.76 249.64 B: (( yes )) 

249.70 250.74 A: (( ah )) 

251.19 254.91 B: so uh i think that would be one of the 

251.39 252.59 A: (( wow )) 

255.32 258.85 B: scariest situations and it spreads 

257.33 258.91 A: (( yeah well bio )) 

258.95 261.82 A: yeah bio terrorism is uh 

260.86 262.44 B: yeah 

261.84 267.70 A: that's uh that's really scary and who knows for all we know the s. a. r. s. could be bio terrorism 

268.44 269.72 A: um 

268.48 270.00 B: yeah 

270.04 275.45 A: you know the or or or poisoning the waterways i mean there there are other forms of 

275.78 277.77 A: of terrorizing people 

277.93 279.17 A: um 

277.98 279.56 B: (( yes )) 

279.71 289.76 A: so that might happen and uh you just i don't know i think you just live each day and uh and 

288.75 290.98 B: that's all you can do 

290.52 293.73 A: and enjoy yourself while you're there and uh 

293.93 298.98 A: luckily for the two of us we live in uh beautiful parts of the world um 

298.87 302.07 B: (( yes how do you feel about uh )) 

299.86 300.74 A: so 

302.11 305.85 B: flying have you flown since nine eleven 

305.72 307.07 A: yes i have 

307.15 310.47 B: were you concerned about terrorism [sigh] 

307.36 308.51 A: (( uh )) 

309.81 310.85 A: no 

311.15 315.31 A: no i'm i'm not concerned about all that 

315.54 316.91 A: (( uh )) 

317.49 319.21 A: i don't like my 

319.55 324.60 A: civil liberty you know the extra security precautions and all that are just 

325.12 337.44 A: troublesome i mean it just it's more of a bother than anything um no i'm not worried about it i just think i really feel that those guys it was a pretty much a one time shot and they 

337.57 343.47 A: they just carried it out well and there was no preparation on our behalf we were coming off labor day 

343.72 346.19 A: everybody's pretty relaxed and uh 

346.36 347.87 A: they uh 

348.64 351.34 A: they did what they did you know and 

351.19 352.59 B: (( yes )) 

352.02 357.22 A: i don't see them i don't see it happen it it hasn't happened since 

357.84 360.85 A: uh the nine eleven thing um 

358.09 359.45 B: right 

360.80 362.81 B: i was uh 

362.95 370.50 B: afraid to fly for quite a while after that but i would not i haven't but i would be willing to now 

365.47 366.65 A: (( mhm )) 

370.29 371.31 A: yeah 

370.69 373.85 B: i i feel like you know that uh 

374.32 377.40 B: they'll probably try something else 

377.34 378.57 A: oh sure 

378.68 380.19 A: you know they'll they'll 

380.26 385.22 A: they'll try things over here but there's not much you can do when 

385.23 392.68 A: somebody's gonna risk their life they don't they don't have no uh they have no concern for their own life 

392.76 397.74 A: [laughter] i mean they are killing themselves to kill others i mean that's uh 

398.06 402.76 A: there's no defense against that i i can't think of a defense 

399.90 400.56 B: (( right )) 

403.03 409.54 B: i think something that would put people into a panic and make 'em stay at home a lot if there were 

409.56 413.16 B: suicide bombings in shopping centers 

412.78 413.76 A: that's true 

413.79 415.62 A: yeah that's uh 

416.12 422.36 B: [lipsmack] that would really hurt our economy and i'm surprised that that hasn't happened before but 

421.35 429.53 A: yeah or a sporting event or a or a movie theater that would another good one i mean 'cause it's easy access i mean they're not protecting people 

424.94 426.05 B: yeah 

427.92 436.31 B: but that's nothing something you can pay somebody to do they have to be fanatical and i guess people like that are 

433.76 434.87 A: right 

437.10 441.28 B: uh [sigh] not very common in this country [laughter] 

438.40 439.45 A: well 

440.81 449.74 A: no well we have a few of our own over these past few years i mean timothy mcvay and the oklahoma bombing and you you just [mn] how 

449.92 452.33 A: are ya going to stop it i mean how are ya 

452.68 454.56 A: how can you can stop it i mean we 

454.83 461.28 A: we we have even removed the head gu- we haven't removed saddam hussein we haven't removed bin laden we haven't 

461.53 467.24 A: (( you know it's there's always going to be somebody else and this and that i don't know )) 

467.42 470.82 B: there will always be something going on 

469.29 474.44 A: yeah there's always going to be some some craziness going on 

473.45 487.12 B: but i'm glad they are um preparing uh health care workers in hospitals more to uh [lipsmack] receive patients in cases of bio terrorism at least they know 

479.18 480.17 A: (( mhm )) 

487.31 489.11 B: what they should do 

489.13 490.18 A: right 

489.66 492.30 B: and they're having drills 

491.88 497.75 A: good yeah we just one had on the golden gate bridge uh yesterday 

495.46 496.92 B: oh 

498.14 503.43 A: they prepared they did a drill closed part of the bridge down for a while 

503.65 505.61 A: to prepare for uh 

505.85 509.41 A: for a terrorist attack i mean they actually had a simulation 

510.21 515.46 A: with buses and you know and somebody wanting to blow the bridge up what would happen and yah de yah 

515.98 517.41 B: (( well )) 

516.39 520.01 A: interesting so there's preparation i mean you 

519.36 521.51 B: it's better than nothing 

521.65 522.67 A: (( know yeah )) 

521.67 527.71 B: if if they don't get to you first [laughter] then you have a pretty good chance of 

527.11 528.77 A: oh exactly 

528.09 529.59 B: surviving 

528.99 533.99 A: yeah i'm gonna be in europe this summer and i you know that's i'll i'll

579.21 585.29 A: yeah we uh my girlfriend and i we we were going to go uh the canary islands 

585.51 591.79 A: and we changed that plan because of morocco just got hit in in the capital

596.00 597.56 A: and um
