106.25 108.33 A: the smoking cam- campaign 

108.28 114.83 B: yeah like the ban and smoking in public places in places like new york and uh

115.89 117.49 B: california 

117.51 119.04 A: yeah what do you think

120.08 121.26 A: [laughter] 

120.85 122.39 B: [laughter] they just 

121.53 125.83 A: i think it's probably on purpose they put a smoker and a non smoker together in a 

125.91 127.73 B: yeah 

126.44 128.22 A: in a conversation [laughter] 

128.53 142.33 B: they just my favorite coffee shop out here in philly uh april first they made it non smoking and i think boycotted it for a little bit i i wouldn't go in there i was all angry 

133.00 133.85 A: yeah 

142.78 147.28 B: and uh now i go once in a while so i'm getting over it but 

146.52 151.05 A: yeah it's it's not a terrible thing i mean you know you can smoke outside or something 

150.69 153.33 B: yeah but um 

153.72 159.10 B: it's it's cool but like you know today i can't go down there because it was raining 

159.76 162.14 B: so i wasn't gonna sit outside 

159.95 163.89 A: oh yeah [laughter] don't really want to sit outside yeah in the rain drinking coffee 

162.62 166.45 B: yeah and i like i like to drink coffee and smoke cigarettes 

167.51 169.07 A: yeah well 

169.29 173.70 A: that's i guess is why it's pretty much a fifty fifty thing half people like it half the people don't 

173.50 174.34 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

174.70 175.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

175.42 179.31 A: i don't really have a problem with it actually since i don't really smoke 

179.20 181.00 B: yeah 

179.84 189.15 A: i don't you know i don't like secondhand smoke but i realize that it takes a crap load of that stuff to equal what you get when you actually smoke 

188.66 189.56 B: uh-huh 

189.42 193.38 A: so people don't need to worry too much about secondhand smoke 

193.39 194.30 A: (( [noise] i )) 

193.49 194.74 B: (( yeah i )) 

194.94 195.63 A: (( don't know )) 

197.52 198.65 A: but it's it's 

198.72 201.57 A: i think it's up to like the individual restaurants 

198.78 200.18 B: i think like 

201.26 203.12 B: mhm 

201.77 205.27 A: i think that's fine but if they make like a loss against it 

205.81 208.21 A: that that may be pushing it too far 

208.17 210.90 B: yeah i think it is too you know 

210.06 220.52 A: like if an owner of a restaurant like smoked for like forty years and then then they got sick or something got emphysema if they wanna you know ban it in their restaurant they have all you know all the rights yeah 

218.88 221.55 B: yeah totally 

221.65 222.82 A: (( i don't know )) 

223.74 226.56 A: but it's good that they like stopped it 

226.82 231.10 A: in uh like you know they just allow it in the bar parts of restaurants and stuff 

231.93 234.00 A: like like family restaurants 

232.21 233.33 B: yeah 

233.64 235.70 B: (( yeah i )) 

234.33 235.72 A: and they stopped it there 

235.78 241.47 B: i i worked in an and you couldn't smoke in the restaurant but you could smoke in the bar area 

241.08 243.96 A: yeah i think that's fine you you know i know 

243.30 245.83 B: and that that's fine you know 'cause like 

244.47 246.68 A: nobody wants to have little their little kids 

246.64 251.64 B: yeah and the smokers could still eat at bar tables you know 

247.48 248.99 A: inhaling the stuff 

251.49 253.18 A: yeah or just 

251.94 254.40 B: which that doesn't bother me 

253.71 255.88 A: finish your meal and hop out to the bar 

255.76 257.57 B: yeah 

257.82 262.88 A: let me see the campaigns there's another part of the freaking question i never listen to that chick [laughter] 

263.18 264.22 B: oh 

265.06 266.69 A: how many of these calls have you done 

266.48 268.04 B: this is my second one 

267.86 269.94 A: yeah first one i did 

268.83 269.85 B: how about you 

270.02 273.26 A: this is like my second but the first one didn't really count 'cause the guy 

273.98 275.97 A: he like he barely spoke english 

275.93 277.32 B: oh jeeze 

276.62 279.68 A: he had a really thick like indian accent 

279.79 288.74 A: and i was like what what what was the topic and he's was like i just could not understand a word that he said so i just kinda hung up i felt kinda bad but i mean [laughter] 

286.76 287.93 B: [laughter] 

288.49 290.17 B: [laughter] 

289.44 294.20 A: i think okay it's hard enough talking to someone you don't know for ten minutes but when you can't understand them 

293.60 295.51 B: yeah 

294.46 295.96 A: that's gotta be worse 

295.81 296.86 B: (( i know )) 

297.57 299.31 A: um okay 

302.10 304.66 B: yeah i always wanted to move out to seattle 

304.70 306.07 A: [mn] it's nice out here it is 

306.04 307.76 B: yeah 

306.28 308.05 A: at least we get used to the rain 

308.25 310.11 B: yeah 

309.06 312.10 A: but when i i grew up in eight years in san diego 

312.31 315.02 A: and then move here it's kinda different [laughter] 

314.36 315.58 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

315.49 317.28 A: (( but yeah i don't mind it )) 

317.56 326.53 B: yeah i always um i was just out in the rain today you know the rain doesn't stop me you know i like the rain i think the rain is cool 

322.85 323.71 A: yeah 

324.49 325.73 A: (( yeah i don't mind it i )) 

326.73 328.89 A: like rain 'cause rain brings mud and 

328.94 331.84 A: mud brings fun places to drive 

330.79 333.50 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

334.68 335.69 A: (( uh )) 

335.95 338.29 A: but not fun places to smoke [laughter] 

338.14 340.53 B: yeah i know 

338.35 340.21 A: stay on topic [laughter] 

340.48 342.56 A: it's hard to talk about smoking for ten minutes 

343.03 344.94 A: um 

344.18 346.42 B: i can talk about how much i love it 

346.50 350.42 A: i can talk about how much i don't love it but we've actually kinda already 

348.50 350.49 B: [laughter] 

350.72 352.37 A: expressed those opinions 

352.58 353.71 B: yeah 

353.07 356.68 A: does your family smoke or like do they still smoke 

354.69 355.69 B: um 

355.85 358.08 B: well my dad quit smoking 

358.59 360.45 A: that's good 

359.04 360.54 B: and 

361.22 366.60 B: my mom still smokes my sister smokes and i smoke 

367.49 369.39 A: you're all against your dad [laughter] 

369.06 370.07 B: yeah 

371.61 374.85 A: yeah well it's just my dad's been on and off for like 

375.52 383.55 A: as long as i he he smokes for a like a year but he can quit like whenever he wants which his weird he'll start smoking when he gets stressed out you know 

380.29 382.82 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

383.56 385.49 B: yeah 

384.24 392.18 A: and then but once he he knows it's bad so then he'll just be like all right i'll stop that 'cause you know we don't let him smoke in the house so he'll just have to go out on the deck 

392.35 393.75 B: yeah 

392.69 396.73 A: even in the rain and stuff [laughter] but he kinda gets sick of that 

393.93 394.92 B: uh-huh 

395.82 400.30 B: yeah that's what it's like anymore everywhere though [sigh] 

399.88 402.34 A: yeah i guess that's kinda the point like 

402.40 405.53 A: if you know in a public place and they try to ban 

405.53 418.68 A: smoking if it's crappy weather and the only place is to smoke outside people aren't gonna want to smoke well it's either they won't they not gonna want to go there or they're just not gonna want to smoke so i guess they hope it'll it'll deter you from smoking period 

424.10 426.10 A: so i don't plan to start though i mean 

426.09 430.26 B: yeah oh my god the price 

426.16 427.93 A: i'm broke enough as it is 

429.99 432.40 A: what's it like how much is a pack like six

438.07 439.08 A: (( yeah oh that's )) 

439.36 443.98 B: and i pay twenty eight fifty for a carton of ten packs so 

444.46 447.24 A: not bad well whatever my dad gets smokes though he 

444.85 446.45 B: (( so it's just over under three bucks )) 

447.41 449.26 A: he uh smokes mores
