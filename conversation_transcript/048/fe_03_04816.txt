80.72 81.94 B: right 

81.83 90.36 A: it's kinda like not fair you know i understand that a lot of people don't smoke and the smoke bothers them and secondhand smoke is no good yeah

90.68 99.10 B: well they can leave though right [laughter] 'cause i usually i usually don't wanna be around people you know that smoke [noise] that because it bothers me so 

92.93 93.74 A: (( basically )) 

98.92 110.70 B: i would think i could just [noise] leave [laughter] or know if there's gonna be a place hush baby hush baby if there's gonna be [laughter] my children are wanting me if there's gonna be a place where there's a lot of smoking i just wouldn't go 

105.38 106.25 A: [laughter] 

110.71 114.92 B: you know especially like a club atmosphere i just would stay away from that atmosphere 

110.76 111.92 A: (( see )) 

114.55 118.62 A: right and the well what they should do is they should have like um um 

118.91 124.49 A: not yeah well like smokers sections like well like you have one room 

121.40 122.40 B: mhm 

124.12 125.14 B: mhm 

124.40 138.20 A: like one one area that that no smokes in that's a bar and have its and and the other areas like sealed off not like not with the ropes or anything but like so the smoke couldn't go through and have better ventilation 

126.30 127.77 B: that no one smokes in 

128.96 129.79 B: yeah 

132.51 133.35 B: uh-huh 

134.97 135.87 B: right 

137.80 138.64 B: (( right [noise] )) 

138.20 143.16 A: or just like one bar'll be smokeless and this bar has 

143.21 153.76 A: put a nice little bitty sign this is a smoking bar so if you don't smoke they know that you know they're decide which bar to go to before they go in that way everybody has a real a real choice 

145.65 146.73 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

150.40 151.07 B: (( mm )) 

153.42 157.41 B: yeah and i i really don't think i know smoking's bad an everything [noise] but i don't think they should 

157.27 171.32 B: ha- have the ability to be able to tell people what they can and cannot do and where they can do it at it's kinda it's kinda like if you want to wear your seatbelt you can if [noise] don't wanna wear your seatbelt and you wanna put your life at risk you should be able to drive your car without your seatbelt you know 

162.88 163.99 A: (( yes )) 

170.44 173.08 A: true and get that ticket [laughter] 

171.81 178.61 B: right i mean if if if [noise] that's how you feel you know [laughter] i mean if you don't wanna wear you don't wanna [noise] wear but they shouldn't 

176.62 178.25 A: but but 

178.40 190.13 B: [noise] i don't think that you know when you're in your car that you bought and you're going down the road you know [noise] you should be able to wear your seatbelt if you want to or if you don't you don't 'cause you're in own car it's like them telling us what to do in our own home or something 

189.67 192.78 A: yeah and it's it's it's big to be honest 

191.32 194.08 B: (( [noise] hush baby go in there with daddy shush )) 

193.78 201.49 A: to be honest i think uh bloomberg he's taken this a little bit too far because if he was a smoker he wouldn't be doing all this 

194.28 195.61 B: [noise] 

200.94 202.55 B: right right 

201.76 208.91 A: and it's you know he needs the the quality of life well he he's just going overboard with the whole thing 

205.65 206.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

208.47 209.69 B: [laughter] 

209.07 218.75 A: 'cause a lot of big my mother had just called me when was it yesterday she was telling me now they're giving out tickets if they catch you putting a cigarette out on the floor or the streets

252.06 252.97 B: yeah 

252.35 262.26 A: but you know they're just that's the wrong way to go about it and with the smoking all right you wanna raise the cigarettes cigarettes over here are like seven fifty a pack 

255.41 257.02 B: right right 

261.96 264.63 B: (( mhm oh oh wow [laughter] oh my gosh )) 

263.86 265.94 A: yeah they're they're expensible to have

289.75 291.47 B: oh oh my lord 

290.91 304.39 A: and these guys are they're making money 'cause you figure they they send away to the indian the indian reservations over the internet they buy four or five cartons for like thirty forty dollars and if they're selling for five dollars a piece they're making a little profit of what like twenty twenty five dollars a carton 

298.07 299.22 B: mhm 

303.72 305.16 B: mhm 

304.35 313.97 A: so now the a._t._f. from my understanding they're getting involved because there's tobacco you know alcohol tobacco firearms and now they're making it a federal offense 

310.24 311.15 B: (( right )) 

313.81 314.80 B: mhm 

314.01 326.47 A: so by bloomberg raising the price on the cigarettes now these guys are selling it and they're making more money than the drug dealers and now you can't even smoke in a he's he's made you know a prohibition area 

324.44 325.72 B: [laughter] 

325.75 328.49 B: [laughter] oh man it's a mess 

326.80 339.13 A: and it's it's it's kinda bad uh i understand for the people okay i understand if a person doesn't smoke i me personally i wouldn't blow the smoke in front of 'em or i would just hold on 

329.85 331.00 B: yeah 

334.76 335.68 B: mhm 

337.32 338.10 B: yeah
