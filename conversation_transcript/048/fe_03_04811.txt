71.82 77.46 B: [laughter] today i was in downtown and i saw a lot of people just doing uh the lunch break smoking uh 

77.49 78.96 B: on the streets so

106.31 107.19 B: oh

114.09 116.04 A: oh what was that 

115.35 122.39 B: no i'm saying i mean is it is it uh do you think it's having any affect on the people i mean is it like you know uh 

122.41 128.79 B: are people like now smoking less in public or you know do you do you see change off of that 

128.26 138.04 A: oh here in california i don't think they're smoking less but i think they're being more conscientious about it uh before people they wouldn't really care about people that were non smokers 

133.43 134.42 B: (( oh okay )) 

136.23 137.18 B: uh-huh 

137.71 138.85 B: right 

138.14 142.32 A: but now that they forced into it they're going outside and being more polite about it 

141.76 143.80 B: uh-huh uh-huh yeah 

142.67 150.58 A: and actually um 'cause they started that in new york city too and you're hearing about that on the radio how those people are used to smoking in bars and now they're 

147.63 148.59 B: yeah 

150.66 151.86 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

150.71 152.69 A: they're forced into being polite 

152.73 163.28 B: yeah well i mean i haven't seen any of this happening in houston yet uh uh there might be one or it'll come into effect uh later or you know any time soon so 

163.25 177.99 B: uh but i can imagine uh it's hard on the people who are uh they were all smokers too that themselves uh smoking out i mean you know in bars and places like that but uh i mean i think it's a good good good thing that uh 

177.99 184.87 B: they have decided on and uh how you have seen some change i mean at least changing uh people becom- becoming conscientious 

185.06 187.90 A: yeah i i am a non smoker so it's always 

187.76 190.29 B: okay yeah i'm a non smoker too i mean 

187.91 190.81 A: i really didn't care if people smoked or not 

190.45 196.23 B: i mean i i i wouldn't say i mean that i never smoked but uh uh 

196.22 208.22 B: i mean th- the first i mean i'm i'm i'm twenty eight years old and the first twenty twenty one years of my life i mean i never touched a cigarette but uh after that yeah i have uh i have uh 

208.27 218.33 B: you know uh smoked a cigarette once in a while it might be like once in two months or five month i mean even even uh at a longer gap so uh 

219.05 220.35 B: but uh 

220.52 228.85 B: yeah i mean uh i do see it's it's better to have a smoke free [laughter] environment [laughter] 

225.93 227.14 A: [laughter] 

227.81 232.23 A: yeah well i mean we wouldn't really need the laws if people are just going outside in the first place 

232.24 239.59 B: yeah yeah because i mean when i was smoking i w- uh even then you know when i used to smoke once in a while 

239.45 253.57 B: even then i used to feel uncomfortable when i'm not smoking and somebody [laughter] else is smoking so then i realized that you know i really wasn't enjoying when i was even when i was smoking so i thought if you know why why not uh get back to 

244.22 245.39 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

253.37 266.05 B: what i was before and stop smoking completely so you know then uh i mean yeah now i do not smoke uh it might be once in six months or something if i get together with my friends and you know having a drink so 

266.18 268.38 B: uh that's the only time i do now 

268.42 275.16 A: yeah the only time i ever smoked would be like the occasional cigar with my friend like on my birthdays never a regular thing 

269.24 269.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

273.44 274.46 B: uh-huh 

275.09 284.82 B: right yeah i think it's a good idea me not smoke i mean drinking drinking is comparatively better to health for health than uh smoking cigarettes i mean it 

284.89 287.56 B: kills you from inside 

287.90 291.45 A: actually i heard about uh the red wine that's supposed to be good for your heart scienc-

306.97 314.96 B: i don't know i don't know they uh i mean i heard that there'll there'll be a there will be some kind of noise or something when it's like ten minutes so 

314.75 315.42 A: [laughter] 

314.97 322.21 B: keep keep talking 'cause the ten minutes are not [laughter] over [laughter] i mean 

317.73 318.66 A: [laughter] 

321.16 323.93 A: so so how did you first hear about the fisher project [laughter] 

323.72 328.03 B: well i mean one of my one of my friends sent me an email that uh 

328.09 329.08 B: (( uh )) 

329.22 338.46 B: you know they pay you ten dollars for talking ten minutes on the phone and it's uh so he yeah he requested that you know i i go and register for that so i mean 

338.42 350.29 B: you know i used to register it online and uh they said that the uh they asked for some time and then i get nine and ten p._m. in the evening so i mean yesterday also i got a call at nine and i didn't know that uh 

350.84 360.43 B: you know it was you said there was a first time i got this call it was like around eight fifty seven fifty eight in the evening central time and um 

361.17 373.62 B: i i gave my cellphone number so you know normally if i if i if i get a number i mean i have like a hundred or a hundred twenty entries made in my cellphone so most of the time i have people's names coming up because uh 

373.52 383.97 B: you know the people who call me so i save their numbers but this i mean this was a this was i was seeing just the number showing up on my screen so i knew it was from somebody who was not in my 

384.07 387.39 B: you know the databank of my cellphone 

386.11 387.32 A: [laughter] 

387.40 393.62 B: [laughter] so i just i just didn't pick it up let it go to my answering machine and then uh 

394.00 398.84 B: it it it rang again and then when i picked it up it was like from a two one five 

398.93 400.85 B: uh area code and uh 

400.87 407.62 B: started some automated you know voice on the other end and i knew that this might be you know one of those uh 

408.02 408.79 B: uh 

409.09 416.35 B: those telemarketers so i just hung up and then [laughter] then i got a call from the friend who had actually sent me the forwarded me this this 

416.26 423.91 B: email about this whole thing and he told me that uh you know the call you will get to talk for ten minutes would be from area code two one five 

423.78 428.12 B: (( [laughter] so i said okay so it means i missed my first chance )) 

427.93 439.65 B: so but today now i mean when i got this call so i thought okay let's see what it's all about and so you know that's how we are talking [laughter] 

437.99 445.70 A: [laughter] yeah i'm kinda used to this because i'm a psychology major so for extra credit they'd have us participate in experiments like this you know 

441.46 442.55 B: (( okay )) 

445.36 447.34 B: oh okay okay so 

446.62 449.00 A: this is kind of old hat for me 

448.81 451.35 B: oh so you you have done this before 

451.17 455.43 A: oh not this particular study but this is similar to other things i've participated in 

455.52 463.73 B: okay so wha- what actually are they trying to do i mean you know by if i talk about smoking in public place i mean how is this survey 

463.77 470.16 B: i mean what what is the what is the purpose of this survey i mean what are they trying to do do you have any idea [noise] 

469.85 475.57 A: um the way it was described to me is that they're just trying to study how people talk over the telephone 

472.16 472.88 B: (( mm )) 

475.77 477.63 A: i guess how if um 

477.53 483.96 B: they're trying to study the psychology of the people form the way they talk on the telephone or their accent or you know 

483.79 488.93 A: uh they weren't exactly that clear because when i called i think i got like an intern 

486.46 487.70 B: (( mhm )) 

488.91 489.78 B: uh-huh 

488.99 497.01 A: i don't think it was the actual person running the study but i guess they're trying to see like maybe a few people on cellphones versus people on 

497.55 501.75 A: like i don't know cordless phones that they have 

502.00 509.78 A: different ways of speaking do they speak faster do they speaker slower dialects i'm not exactly sure what the purpose is 

502.01 502.96 B: uh-huh 

506.33 507.61 B: oh okay 

509.77 511.83 B: mm one guy was telling me this 

509.82 511.58 A: they they may actually yeah 

512.13 519.83 B: uh actually one of my friends was telling me that uh you know uh one of the purposes of doing this is to try and [mn] 

519.92 529.87 B: like record these conversations which when people i know i mean how you know like like i'm i'm i'm uh i was born and raised in india so you know my way of uh 

529.91 533.96 B: uh speaking english or my way of pronouncing certain words 

533.87 548.81 B: are different that you know yours so you know this way they they they try to get as much information they can like how people talk and how they pronounce the words so that they can they can have you know when they programme these uh 

548.67 554.65 B: you know you have these uh services now that you know you have automated system on the other side 

553.42 555.64 A: yeah that's probably it they're just 

555.09 567.30 B: so so it could be you know they they fed like all these kinds i mean all these different ways in which a word is pronounced so that those uh automated system can understand you know when for example 

565.61 567.96 A: yeah it's probably something like that [laughter] 

567.36 581.51 B: yes well i mean i i i have wondered i mean that was uh one reason you know i was uh interested in it i mean you know uh though i mean i i know i i will never see any result but uh you know just contributing to something 

581.67 582.30 B: (( so )) 

582.34 584.94 B: just decided let's go for it so 

585.98 596.84 B: [mn] so uh yeah yeah so right so but anyway if i'm not doing anything for ten minutes in my day why not use the time to make some money [laughter] 

586.11 590.28 A: that's what i figured it's a dollar a minute you know easy money so [laughter] 

596.21 597.05 A: (( [laughter] )) 

596.92 599.95 B: [laughter] so are you are you uh uh are you
