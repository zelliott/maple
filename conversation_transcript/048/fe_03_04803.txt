28.84 32.91 A: no i did something worse actually 

33.01 36.58 A: yeah i worked as an actuary for a little while i 

35.77 39.27 B: oh well that's what you wanted to be 

39.25 41.07 A: (( guess [laughter] )) 

39.31 47.67 B: [laughter] [laughter] at least for now well anyhow we better talk about the subject and boy they really picked a controversial one 

42.43 43.59 A: yeah 

47.45 54.75 A: yeah well i it's very easy for me because i actually i quit almost exactly two months ago 

54.43 56.73 B: oh how you doing 

56.34 59.00 A: uh fine fine it's really great 

57.79 60.96 B: did you use patches or anything like that 

60.33 63.57 A: no nothing at all i um 

62.17 64.76 B: you just said this is it 

64.18 73.84 A: yeah i might not have been considered such a hardcore smoker i mean i smoked pretty much consistently for like four years but about on average i would say half pack a day 

73.51 76.19 B: this would did you start this in college 

76.07 83.89 A: i started way before college unfortunately it became like really regular when i was in college 

78.96 79.71 B: (( uh-huh )) 

82.79 85.00 B: (( yeah when you were in college yeah )) 

84.40 88.30 A: yeah and then certainly after also so um 

88.33 102.62 A: i i live in a suburb of new york and mostly when i go out it's in the city and in new york they did do a ban recently on smoking in all public places and for me i mean on so many levels i think it's absolutely brilliant i mean 

95.53 96.62 B: mhm 

102.64 114.97 A: even when i did smoke often times places were way too smoky even for me and it would hurt my eyes and the only way that it wouldn't hurt like be offensive is if i kept on smoking 

115.13 122.89 A: and certainly with me not wanting to smoke and in my effort to quit i mean going out and getting a drink or 

122.88 135.79 A: um you know sitting at well mostly revolves around alcohol but even in a caf or something those are the times that i really felt i needed a cigarette and um it's so delightful to just not be allowed to so 

127.49 128.52 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

135.77 144.02 A: even thought it's taking away my self control i mean i mean not my self control my my own will a little bit i don't really care as long as it keeps me from smoking 

143.63 149.29 B: well i uh first ran into a smoking smoking ban in san francisco 

149.73 150.89 A: oh okay 

150.55 157.53 B: and uh i i had moved back here already but i was going out there every year i've been back 

157.37 167.98 B: in philadelphia since ninety one but i went back to san francisco every couple of years to visit old friends and i did after all live there for many years and it's very curious 

167.93 174.70 B: there seemed to be a very strong demarcation between people who felt 

174.78 185.79 B: that the movement was good and those who were furious about it now you don't in san francisco which is not that hot a place i mean they have a lot of cool weather nothing 

179.10 179.96 A: mhm 

185.16 187.78 A: yeah i've been there 

185.83 189.87 B: very rarely only once every twenty years below freezing 

189.72 196.25 B: but you don't have like i see in new york these clusters of people in the snow 

189.84 191.64 A: mhm 

196.10 209.67 B: standing in doorways and of course it's the same way down here and we've had a severe winter and you see these people come out the door in their shirtsleeves [laughter] ha- have the fastest cigarette in history [laughter] and let's just say 

196.57 197.16 A: (( [mn] )) 

206.85 208.10 A: yeah 

209.11 210.52 A: yeah 

209.70 219.69 B: maybe it's time to stop but i i've never i've never had the habit so i'm i i never could i have sinus problems that were 

212.27 213.53 A: yeah 

218.98 220.20 A: (( i see oh )) 

219.68 228.01 B: exacerbated by it and although as i became an adult i went into a bar once in awhile i never enjoyed it 

227.68 230.80 A: okay that's very yeah 

228.28 232.85 B: i started drinking at home because no one was smoking there 

232.67 234.27 A: ah so then you 

234.93 237.16 B: and when i was in san francisco 

236.08 237.30 A: i mean 

237.55 238.86 B: go ahead 

238.33 242.99 A: think about the restrictions you must really like being in a non smoking environment 

242.57 254.09 B: oh i lov- it it's funny in our subways down here it is absolutely indicated everywhere that you shouldn't smoke but the city is so 

250.22 251.64 A: yeah 

254.05 263.38 B: relieved that they have gotten people finally not to ever practically never anyhow smoke on the trains 

263.41 276.53 B: that they don't enforce the no smoking in the stations and i'm sorry because one cigarette in a very large area becomes very noticeable instantly 

267.15 267.84 A: oh 

274.83 276.97 A: yes quite so 

277.43 283.76 B: well do you think that other places will go this way or it it's gonna turn around 

283.14 285.95 A: no i think that other places will follow because 

284.85 289.36 B: did you hear that that suit got overturned in florida today 

288.94 290.75 A: no i didn't 

290.07 292.69 B: yeah the tobacco company said you 

292.79 299.23 B: know a hundred thirty five million or billion or mil- something like a million and a billion in our 

299.16 309.73 B: com- cur- cur- currency makes no difference to me but they said it was a good move by the judge to throw this out and i said oh yeah 

301.84 302.40 A: (( [mn] )) 

309.72 316.27 B: then i see in the news tonight that the worldwide ban on s- advertisement's under way 

312.32 312.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

316.28 317.25 A: oh 

317.32 319.77 A: that's very good 

318.00 320.29 B: for cigarette smoking 

319.86 325.34 A: i don't know too much about advertising speaking personally i feel very unswayed by advertisements 

325.24 332.07 B: well i never thought the marlboro man was made interesting by the fact he was smoking a cigarette [laughter] 

332.02 338.99 A: [laughter] yeah uh me neither but um i did but uh a friend and i were talking like the great 

339.02 348.24 A: actresses in the forties and fifties and sixties and so i mean greta garbo and um bette davis and audrey hepburn i mean 

340.99 342.86 B: oh yes 

348.08 353.53 B: oh yes they all dangled from their lips like such an alluring thing and i used to say 

353.68 360.17 B: ooh who wants to kiss something that's akin to the bottom of an ashtray 

359.93 363.61 A: yeah but on screen you know [laughter] you don't smell it 

360.45 361.21 B: [laughter] 

363.35 369.82 B: you know what really made me never even consider the possibility i was in a carpool 

369.88 370.80 A: mhm 

370.38 381.09 B: and in the winter time the car would sit out all night with all the cigarettes butts in the ashtray and i was the first one in that car in the morning ah ooh [laughter] 

376.22 377.20 A: oh 

380.36 381.13 A: [laughter] 

381.82 383.71 A: yes i can imagine 

383.08 386.12 B: so you didn't use anything other than will 

385.85 389.84 A: no i mea- it it just happened that um 

390.03 404.35 A: you know i've quit probably for real or what i consider for real probably about three or four times beforehand and every time it was like you know cigarettes are expensive relative to their merit 

404.05 407.72 B: yeah when i was a kid they were twenty five cents a pack 

404.40 405.98 A: and 

407.68 417.41 A: yeah but even so any- anything you pay for them still expensive [laughter] relative to their merit and um i just knew like it was not healthy 

407.83 408.83 B: [laughter] 

417.26 431.90 A: and it was just a stupid thing so i thought that i should quit but i really really liked it and then a few months ago you know i was i just decided to take a different approach um in general and i started cutting out a lot of um 

431.92 446.02 A: like harmful foods and tried to exercise more and the cigarettes just didn't go with that so then i decided that i i like in no way wanted to i just didn't want to associate myself with cigarettes anymore it's over 

446.03 455.63 A: as part of like a greater thing that i'm changing about myself and like so far it's been absolutely great i really just don't want them it's not 

452.57 453.53 B: [laughter] 

454.81 461.22 B: it was so funny last night we have one of those huge chains of gyms here a couple of blocks from where i live 

460.93 462.00 A: mhm 

461.37 473.02 B: [laughter] and sitting out on the front steps were three guys with pretty good bodies in shorts and all smoking cigarettes then a girl with the name of the gym 

468.17 469.29 A: mhm 

473.49 479.07 B: crossed her chest it must have weighed at least two fifty pounds came out with a bag of trash 

479.11 487.29 B: then this woman came out looking like she'd never lifted anything in her life heavier than a piece of paper [laughter] and these are 

487.30 495.52 B: very bad advertisements for health and fitness and i think a lot of people don't realize that you were very wise to take that approach 

489.13 490.84 A: yeah 

495.82 497.14 A: well 

496.00 499.01 B: i hope you stick to it and you don't get tempted again 

498.88 504.88 A: thank you well my mom actually also quit quit like a month before i did and she 

503.81 506.81 B: oh so you grew up in a smoking household 

506.05 520.27 A: yeah yeah definitely but um she she quit with one of the local community things that are partially funded i think by um state funds and partially funded by the money from the um 

512.08 513.12 B: mhm 

516.98 518.05 B: mhm 

520.32 531.96 A: uh big tobacco suits and uh she's tried to quit a few times in her life and she's been smoking now well she had been since she was like nineteen and and now she's 

531.92 542.04 A: uh mid fifties so for almost um forty years she was smoking and she finally was able to quit with one of the cessation programs 

541.94 545.30 B: did she smoke when she was pregnant 

544.44 549.27 A: i'm sure not i think we spoke about that and she says no i believe her 

550.10 552.22 B: it it's funny i uh 

552.50 561.89 B: i was the youngest child and i grew up in a neighborhood with practically no kids because they were all my brothers ages older 

561.06 562.91 A: mhm 

562.05 568.70 B: and yet i did have one friend lived up the street and his mother became unexpectedly pregnant in her forties and she said 

568.66 577.84 B: oh having a baby after forty isn't difficult it's quitting smoking for eight months that's the hardest part [laughter] 

575.01 576.72 A: yeah 

577.23 579.74 A: cigarettes caffeine and alcohol 

578.92 591.68 B: but uh well in those days people didn't give up too much on alcohol but smoking was for some reason seen as not good i mean it's not that she drank a lot they just had wine once in a while with dinner but 

590.58 592.23 A: yeah yeah 

591.46 599.89 B: but uh that was really something and i applaud the efforts but i wish we could get through to our kids these ten twelve year olds
