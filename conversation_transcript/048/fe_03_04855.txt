0.61 1.68 A: hello 

1.17 3.81 B: hello this is winston speaking 

3.36 7.38 A: hi this is uh matt from bellingham washington 

6.94 8.68 B: nice to hear from you matt 

8.43 10.07 A: nice to hear from you too 

10.30 17.92 B: i believe our topic is to discuss whether we would panic or uh not we would but uh the public would panic it sounds to me 

10.53 11.35 A: so 

17.63 23.64 A: uh it sounds like uh it was kind of a two part question both us personally and the general public 

23.13 24.22 B: okay 

24.24 26.17 B: you go you go first 

25.72 30.06 A: okay well i think that uh the general public 

30.22 31.49 A: um 

32.32 34.16 A: at this point 

34.35 44.77 A: would panic in terms of uh the economic market um you know we'd probably see a a big drop in uh in the stock market certainly 

45.01 51.24 A: um on the day of and following days of after a- another ensuing attack 

51.65 52.91 A: um 

53.66 54.22 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

54.05 59.83 A: and uh i think that probably within within the given geographic area 

59.79 70.07 A: you know like probably surrounding whatever city was attacked uh you'd probably see a little hysteria but uh overall the country has become a little bit calloused 

70.22 72.87 A: um and uh 

72.98 76.96 A: you know as americans are generally a little a little um 

78.21 83.54 A: oh i don't know a little more nonchalant than than uh a couple of years ago 

85.95 87.81 B: (( right would you me like to give )) 

87.90 89.04 B: uh my input 

88.95 89.91 A: sure 

89.58 98.29 B: initially i i would imagine uh very similar lines to yours the economy would probably suffer people are looking for some reason to uh 

98.81 106.23 B: to rock the boat so they can either make money or otherwise cause a bit of a stir for other people to de- uh 

106.84 107.82 B: um 

109.45 115.04 B: what's the word deinvest that would be in the broader terms i think in the 

115.50 125.45 B: the more finite terms uh i come from south africa so we used to terrorism we've lived it for forty years already and we found that uh in the beginning people 

121.93 122.82 A: (( mm )) 

125.63 135.90 B: there's a bit of a wave of of hysteria call it hysteria or unrest and then as things progress uh people are innovative they start making all sorts of plans 

136.20 137.60 B: to uh 

137.71 139.16 B: (( every intent to )) 

140.46 143.79 B: for instance they used to throw the bombs into our supermarket 

144.17 153.65 B: and into schools and into creches and into churches or what they did was the churches used to mount a guard outside during services and the uh schools did the same 

153.67 154.38 A: (( mm )) 

153.92 158.02 B: (( and they also went in for smaller schools where the security was better )) 

158.08 162.28 B: so people do get used to these things and they start uh becoming innovative 

162.36 168.52 B: i think we can see that in palestine and jerus- and and uh israel at the moment you know they've been with it so long 

162.80 163.43 A: (( mm )) 

168.74 170.26 B: that they uh 

171.11 176.21 B: they don't panic when these things happen they expect it to happen and all they do is to try and 

176.79 179.93 B: um get the remedy for it the next time around 

179.86 180.58 A: (( mm )) 

180.09 185.24 B: but i think for the extra people involved in the terrorist attack that normally in in 

185.30 187.73 B: our background already uh 

189.06 190.31 B: um 

190.62 192.47 B: (( what's the )) 

193.20 196.81 B: word opposite of of panic they are very uh 

196.79 197.64 A: (( ah )) 

196.90 198.06 B: orderly 

198.20 206.74 B: and they think very clearly because they have been told up ahead and they've actually devised plans themselves exactly what to do so you're go into your 

198.32 199.23 A: yeah 

206.82 214.53 B: action mode and you immediately phone the hospitals and tell them the the type of casualties and how many you estimate it to be 

214.88 219.23 B: and what you ask them what they're going to do and you get stuck in and do your bit in the meantime 

219.11 230.79 A: [mn] do you believe that um americans are in general more mentally and emotionally prepared for a terrorist attack now than uh two years ago 

230.97 232.71 A: or a year and a half ago 

232.30 239.36 B: oh yes i'm pretty sure and i the first time it always catches everybody unawares and you think especially in america they have never been 

239.70 244.19 B: uh attacked by air force in within your own boundaries before 

243.97 245.21 A: right 

244.57 251.66 B: uh and people were inclined to panic far more than they do in other countries and i think what from my experience but 

252.86 257.54 B: uh this is is seen from a different viewpoint by somebody who's used to terrorism 

257.57 267.14 B: but as it goes along and you you find you've got to live with it you already think as i said about the remedy up ahead and you think exactly what you're going to do so you become 

264.24 264.86 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

267.63 276.57 B: uh a different kind of person all together you expect something like that to happen and uh when it comes you are um not relaxed but you 

276.79 280.79 B: what you do is you you try and do your best where you are at that stage 

281.28 282.01 A: (( oh )) 

283.31 291.09 B: but i think that to answer your question to answer your question uh i'm pretty sure they are already better equipped at this stage in washington 

283.49 285.27 A: that's fascinating 

291.05 294.40 A: yeah yeah i think so too it it 

294.56 296.21 A: (( it's um )) 

296.92 301.26 A: well you know it's it's funny we've we've kinda gone through these waves 

301.27 314.05 A: where we're used to uh in a sense we had our own terrorism when uh when we were expanding as as a culture uh from the east coast to the west coast and you know you had lawlessness 

314.16 319.75 A: throughout three quarters of the land where basically uh whoever was uh 

319.88 334.44 A: you know uh i mean everybody carried guns and they were exposed and your you know life was was much cheaper back then but then as that uh faded away we got um more and more 

334.27 339.18 A: um [lipsmack] i guess we uh have over the past say 

339.21 342.68 A: you know fifty sixty years or so we've we've led 

342.89 345.79 A: sort of less hostile lives so this 

346.03 351.23 A: september eleventh really shook us up like you know oh my gosh now we're 

351.51 354.45 A: we're uh this is sort of a throw back in a way 

354.51 358.53 A: uh to uh more um more violence 

355.06 355.93 B: yeah 

358.62 368.48 B: it must come as a shock to to realize that the civilized world is not quite what we thought it would be and you have to you have to re-orientate yourself from the beginning again 

364.89 366.48 A: yeah you know like 

368.57 379.75 A: it's amazing we i i think that the the shock has its base in the fact that we as what we consider a civilized people 

380.01 390.43 A: consider ourselves um above being uh uh neanderthals or above being uh you know be- being beyond [noise] the 

390.48 396.53 A: caveman mentality yet we aren't really we're we're still part of the animal kingdom 

392.73 393.41 B: (( right )) 

396.07 403.47 B: well that's the basis for self survival you know you you kick into a different gear all together when you survival 

402.83 404.52 A: yeah yeah 

403.56 405.65 B: (( and that's almost an )) 

405.72 407.17 B: inborn uh 

408.19 409.19 B: um 

409.52 411.77 B: attribute in this world i would imagine 

411.46 418.97 A: yeah we're we're and we're all you know we that's that is the most powerful trait in all of us 

419.07 424.46 A: is is basic survival yet we fool ourselves with uh all of these 

424.49 434.32 A: charades that we build around uh ourselves you know that society builds to make ourselves feel like we're completely separate from the animal kingdom when we're in fact we're 

434.65 441.49 A: no more separate evolutionary than we were you know thousands of years ago [noise] 

440.13 442.03 B: (( well i second that for sure )) 

442.05 443.11 A: yeah 

442.17 447.99 B: it's just i i feel the american people uh you know being in the site position they've been all these centuries 

447.95 460.67 B: or years they've uh sort of felt that they're untouchable and then suddenly they realize they're no different to the rest of the world they can also be touched very violently and this is this must be a terrible adjustment for somebody 

452.25 453.08 A: yes 

457.11 458.30 A: mhm 

460.57 467.96 B: i remember the very first time it ever happened in our country that we came from it was a horrible shock and the first thing was you started doubting 

468.52 472.15 B: the second thing you wanted to take up arms against an enemy you never saw 

472.27 479.13 B: and the third thing you start asking why eventually you started asking yourself why do these people do this and that's at a different uh 

479.72 480.75 B: um 

481.97 483.59 B: (( you know it's just )) 

482.08 489.36 A: [mn] it it appears that we haven't gotten to the point where we are asking why i think we're still in shock 

489.43 491.92 B: yes i'm i'm pretty sure of that 

491.35 499.83 A: and lashing out you know oh oh my goodness it must be a wreck okay let's let's let's go attack them and oh it must be afghanistan oh you know [mn] 

498.50 499.25 B: yes 

499.53 512.38 B: it's gotta somebody we can we put our hand on and there's a lot of bad people you can put your hands on like they're always the hidden man you'll never where they're gonna pop out and this is what makes it such an awful thing to fight because you really never know 

507.55 508.83 A: right 

512.40 515.19 B: whether they're going to come from and and 

513.79 521.47 A: yeah and it necessitates asking why that we will not come to a solution until we thoroughly ask why 

521.03 522.65 B: oh yes that's for sure 

521.67 528.33 A: you know and and admit to ourselves that we are only uh what is it uh 

528.76 531.97 A: five five percent of the world's population 

532.11 533.90 A: yet we use 

534.01 538.69 A: uh half of the resources i think that's the the statistic 

538.86 540.38 A: um to 

539.29 545.24 B: uh there's a kinder one i believe eighteen percent but that's that's pretty well enough you know let's let's put it this way 

545.12 554.60 B: the people in this country live wonderfully well it's a very peaceful nice and it's it's a very uh money wise it's a it's a very good to live in 

554.46 555.50 A: mhm 

554.93 565.89 B: and uh suddenly hardship comes along with it and they just have to make that adjustment but i think they american people won't take long to make that adjustment and then the third phase will kick in and they'll ask why 

565.96 569.53 B: and the fourth phase is unfortunately when you realize that um 

569.98 571.09 B: um 

571.74 574.25 B: aggressiveness begets aggressiveness 

573.87 575.47 A: mhm 

574.72 581.97 B: and then you've gotta really have a good look at yourself and say you know what have i got to lose to come to terms with this enemy of mine 

582.07 583.06 A: mhm 

582.14 584.93 B: (( otherwise we're all going to wreck each other's lives )) 

584.82 586.09 A: mhm 

585.47 588.31 B: but uh it's a long before you get there 

588.18 599.89 A: yeah unfortunately i think that uh especially with the current powers that be we're going to continue to desperately seek to uh maintain at least
