31.13 32.91 B: oh really okay 

33.83 36.34 A: the ones that thought that they were right 

36.90 43.66 A: maybe in in danger there there was some minor panic at the um 

42.22 43.32 B: mhm 

44.10 49.53 A: white house and the capitol people sort of ran out but i i think overall people were were calm 

49.36 54.09 B: oh really okay and wh- and where were you in washington were you near the pentagon 

54.40 58.75 A: about twelve blocks from the capitol i could see the pentagon ah from i

61.99 64.25 B: oh really yeah yeah yeah yeah 

64.32 66.39 B: so yeah you know i 

66.61 70.44 B: i often think it's like nowadays there's just so much of it happening 

70.75 76.16 B: with ah september eleventh and you know and then this whole scare 

74.08 78.51 A: yeah but it really within the united states it's still pretty um 

78.61 80.96 A: it's i think it's still pretty ah 

81.14 87.22 A: pretty rare i mean i i think peop- most people in the united states still take security for granted 

82.36 83.46 B: yeah 

86.96 88.27 B: (( i think so too )) 

87.43 90.53 A: but but we do hear about it a lot so sure 

90.23 104.09 B: yeah yeah yeah um what else did you think um you know i think like nowadays it's becoming just so i hate to say this but it's becoming so every day every day that's what you hear and that's all you hear and that's what's happening in the world and 

102.63 105.33 A: that's true mhm mhm 

104.16 110.61 B: it's like you know what i mean it's like after a while you're like okay you know you're saturated with with all this news and it 

107.74 114.64 A: that's that's right and of course especially in um in washington too um 

113.58 114.54 B: yeah 

114.80 116.89 A: because we really got to where where are you 

116.93 118.49 B: ah los angeles 

118.04 120.34 A: oh okay okay wow 

118.72 121.94 B: yeah yeah yeah the the other the other way around 

121.34 122.71 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

122.08 126.73 B: and um and you know and it's like it and it's like here it's like um 

127.00 139.94 B: i feel i also feel it's like y- when you hear the news that's all you hear you know when you read a you read a time magazine or anything else it's all it's like okay find there's this and then what's happening in iraq and then somebody blew a bomb here it's like 

132.03 133.10 A: (( mhm )) 

140.29 151.95 A: i think part of that is because all the news comes from washington and new york too and those are the two places that are most affected on a day by day basis by the threats of terrorism i mean there really is a difference um 

140.29 141.77 B: you get 

143.67 144.94 B: yeah 

149.17 150.51 B: exactly 

151.49 152.47 B: uh-huh 

152.92 160.60 B: yeah you know and and i and i i also hope i think that perhaps if people start putting out a little more good news also 

160.66 171.53 B: with what's happening in the world because i'm sure there's some good happening in the world you know [laughter] i th- i think there it's like i think it i think i think for me i think personally a problem right now is that 

160.99 162.03 A: (( mhm )) 

163.16 166.22 A: [laughter] i agree 

172.23 178.80 B: a- th- is the whole media and the government and everybody else is just so focused on what the bad things that are happening 

179.02 185.82 B: you know it's like you just don't hear er the other good things that are happening to balance it out and i think if there's a good mix of 

179.09 180.06 A: right 

185.79 194.94 B: the information that comes in people's attention will be taken off a little from you know just like disaster disaster disaster so 

194.60 196.12 A: right i i agree 

195.39 197.95 B: it's yeah so um 

197.17 204.27 A: it's i think it's always like i can remember people saying that that years ago before we had ever even considered terrorism you know 

203.94 204.93 B: uh-huh 

205.14 210.65 A: um i mean they're always going to find something some terrible murder case like o. j. 

205.20 206.06 B: (( i know )) 

210.67 215.33 A: or something they're always going to find something negative 

214.93 223.72 B: exactly you know exactly exactly and i just and i just hope that with all this you know it's like when they find out that all this 

224.11 238.00 B: this endless stuff you hear from iraq right and i'm like okay now hopefully they're going to stop after that [laughter] you don't want to don't want to hear the same endless stuff in another middle eastern country or wherever they go next so 

234.27 235.21 A: (( mhm )) 

237.21 238.50 A: (( mhm )) 

238.11 246.82 B: so hopefully that should be that but did you have any um any feedback being so close to you know new york and what happened there 

247.05 249.77 B: from um from the september eleventh thing 

249.73 264.63 A: oh yes i had a couple of friends in new york and i and i went to new york in early november and um it was much worse in new york with ah the the thing about new york that i remember was all the pictures of the people ah that that had been 

255.82 256.81 B: uh-huh 

264.67 268.44 A: people had put up little signs like have you seen this person which 

266.37 267.41 B: (( mm )) 

268.38 269.39 B: yeah 

268.79 277.75 A: in the when you really think about it there was almost no point to it i mean it beyond a day or two anybody who wouldn't call home you know 

273.26 274.34 B: uh-huh 

276.96 278.80 B: yeah it's like you 

277.75 279.53 A: (( but ah )) 

279.49 292.80 A: but that's that was one of the things oh in in november of two thousand and one those were still up all over the place and my my friend in new york lived right by the the place where all the families were supposed to go and 

284.79 285.84 B: (( know uh-huh )) 

292.12 293.49 B: oh wow okay 

292.93 296.66 A: so yeah it was pretty heavy oh yeah yeah yeah 

294.77 308.37 B: mhm so do you think ah living in washington do you think it has this terrorist attack and then what's happened after that has do you think there's like more security do you think people are more 

306.21 307.49 A: oh definitely 

308.17 315.01 A: well they've closed off ah several streets you know oh yeah oh oh yes permanently um 

311.03 312.45 B: oh really still 

314.30 315.35 B: (( wow )) 

315.22 325.10 A: and oh there's there's a lot more security in the old day you know th- they said the old days even two years' ago you could just walk into the capitol and look at the statues and the artwork 

324.03 325.78 B: oh really okay 

325.29 329.88 A: ah and and i used to really enjoy doing that but you cannot ah do that anymore 

327.77 328.68 B: uh-huh 

328.93 332.55 B: you can't and what about the white house do they still allow people to tour it 

332.53 334.60 A: they only allow 

335.13 338.32 A: like school groups or 

338.46 340.11 A: maybe like 

340.17 346.13 A: i don't know like fraternal groups you cannot tour just as an individual you have to be 

343.46 347.47 B: okay okay yeah really okay yeah because 

346.39 348.56 A: in a school or something like that 

347.96 356.28 B: yeah like i i i mean i've lived here for years now and i'm an amer- an american but initially um ah i was from india and i'd come here to visit 

354.80 355.67 A: uh-huh 

356.06 356.91 A: uh-huh 

356.55 364.33 B: and this was like nineteen eighty and i know that one of the things we did when we visited like i'd come with my i was still a teenager and i'd come with my parents 

364.00 364.94 A: uh-huh 

364.61 371.10 B: and we went to when we went to washington there was this tour and we went to the white house and there were like you know 

371.22 382.37 B: blocks and blocks of people lined up and you could go in and they'd show you the oval room and take you for a nice tour and you could walk the gardens and come back and i'm like okay that's changed for sure [laughter] 

373.34 374.31 A: right 

379.72 380.71 A: right 

381.73 385.96 A: yeah yeah the they guard well yeah it's it's really too bad um 

386.21 395.30 A: but ah so far it it it is still ah closed off to individuals i don't they haven't said it will be forever but they certainly aren't hurrying to open it up again 

394.91 401.26 B: yeah yeah yeah and now what about the airports has it relaxed a bit over there or is it still very tight the security 

401.49 406.53 A: i don't think the airports here are any different than they are 

405.89 407.95 B: in los angeles yeah 

407.25 415.07 A: well the the only difference is if you're flying into national airport which is the close one which i like to fly there um 

413.89 414.78 B: uh-huh 

415.28 429.15 A: you have to remain in your seat a half an hour after you take off and a half an hour um ah when you're when you're landing right which really isn't too much of a problem um 

424.38 426.76 B: (( oh really oh okay so )) 

427.38 431.15 B: yeah yeah yeah and why why is that why did they say that 

430.53 433.71 A: well that's 'cause they don't want anybody moving around 

433.48 435.60 B: oh okay 

434.68 436.96 A: (( and ah national airport )) 

437.37 443.78 A: the ah it's i mean the flight path i did i was doing this just the other day it goes within 

444.55 450.66 A: a very very short distance to the white house the on the normal have you ever landed into national 

447.33 448.31 B: uh-huh 

450.27 454.22 B: yeah when i first w- c- came to visit washington years' ago yeah 

452.82 460.22 A: mhm right well it really is at least one of the landing routes practically goes right over the white house not quite but but practically 

458.72 464.91 B: yeah but you can see it yeah that's true yeah because they they i remember like when they announced it and everybody was like ah 

460.34 461.74 A: right right 

465.01 467.11 B: trying to take a peak [laughter] 

466.52 467.46 A: right 

467.43 469.64 B: (( but so so now you can't huh )) 

469.67 474.15 B: it's like ah they they have you which makes sense you know 

470.21 471.42 A: correct 

473.84 484.06 A: right right th- that i haven't found that as much as an inconvenience either now for a month after september eleventh that airport was completely closed actually it was for more than a month and 

477.42 478.33 B: yeah 

481.06 481.91 B: (( yeah i )) 

482.99 484.57 B: must have been longer right 

484.03 490.23 A: we w- we were really worried about that it was i think it was about two or three months that it was completely closed 

489.64 498.86 B: mhm yeah yeah now what about the what about the the pentagon have they like built it up and it's all back to normal and 

498.95 504.10 A: the pentagon is a little bit different they um 

499.19 500.11 B: do you know 

505.06 509.46 A: i've actually i've only been in their once and ah they oh they've 

509.62 519.02 A: from the outside you would never know there had been anything but they do have when you drive by there's always um 

511.46 512.63 B: you'd never know 

513.01 514.50 B: mhm 

519.17 523.01 A: a p- a couple of police cars there and then there's some ah 

523.11 530.78 A: sort of i guess you'd call it a it's not a tank but it looks sort of like a cross between a car and a tank 

530.02 531.74 B: [laughter] oh okay [laughter] 

530.92 532.42 A: (( and ah )) 

532.64 544.04 A: it's it's right th- ah when you when you drive by there i mean they make it real clear you can't stop or anything but and there's a lot of highways that go by the pentagon but other than that i don't 

544.07 546.56 A: i don't see much difference really 

545.96 547.52 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

546.61 550.04 A: but it's been completely rebuilt completely 

548.47 554.80 B: oh okay oh okay yeah yeah in in los angeles of course there was you know like after 

555.02 567.25 B: after the september eleventh it was um it was the airport was like completely closed for a while and then this is then they they allowed flights and everything but nobody could go in 

567.64 569.98 B: and one of the biggest ah 

567.78 568.79 A: uh-huh 

569.89 572.40 B: criticisms here was like 

572.31 586.01 B: nobody could come to the airport even walk- forget walking and come to the curbside and pick you up and nobody could enter you had to park like miles away and wait and a bus would take the people but they still allowed cab drivers 

577.46 579.35 A: (( mhm )) 

586.16 587.17 A: yeah 

586.31 595.19 B: [laughter] okay so and my mom can't come and pick me up but you know [laughter] here's this strange cab who can drive right by 

587.71 589.52 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

593.62 594.89 A: (( mhm )) 

595.36 599.76 B: but but i think it's kind of it's at least los angeles is back to normal now
