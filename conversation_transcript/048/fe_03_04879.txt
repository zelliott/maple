22.12 29.58 A: yeah was the o. j. trial and that that i guess that was really the the forefront of the of of the trials 

29.35 30.39 B: mhm 

30.00 33.32 A: ah you know really of the i guess of televised 

33.67 39.45 A: trials you know the actually the camera being into the courtroom when they're high profile 

37.14 38.40 B: (( yeah exactly )) 

39.18 40.07 B: mhm 

40.04 48.90 A: ah trials because i mean y- many years ago i can remember you know you it used to be just the sketches you know they would show the sketches on tv

56.44 64.21 A: right but then i guess the next one is ah next big one i guess will be this laci peterson 

64.64 65.54 A: (( ah )) 

65.61 77.21 A: i don't know whether they're gonna actually there ah it's just actually going to be i dunno if it's actually gonna be you know televised or anything but i mean it's getting a lot of media coverage 

76.98 80.79 B: yeah it probably will i mean i know they have ah court t._v. now 

79.18 79.74 A: (( [noise] )) 

80.70 82.93 A: right 

81.48 84.51 B: so it they'll at least be showing it on that [cough] 

84.08 86.27 A: yeah yeah that's for sure 

84.70 86.43 B: what do you think about that 

86.61 93.69 A: well it's i dunno i don't think we've heard the last of it it's it's ah there's definitely something going on somewhere 

87.10 87.67 B: (( [cough] )) 

93.57 94.47 B: yeah 

94.29 96.95 A: ah something more than meets the eye 

96.65 98.27 B: yeah exactly 

97.79 110.53 A: ah and you know we've ah we've been hearing a lot more lately ah you know just about things and as far as you know if the ah you know if the police maybe botched up some evidence or 

110.90 120.52 A: ah or even if you know if they found ah you know if they found her before you know and and then recover her 

120.69 127.40 A: you know before you know before something it's ah to me that's just you know 

123.56 124.42 B: right 

128.06 129.51 A: that's something 

129.57 135.42 B: yeah do you think they should ah i mean do you believe in them televising it or me- 

134.80 141.89 A: oh yeah yeah i mean i think they should you know it's as much as you know i i think as much of these ah 

142.66 147.46 A: ah cr- you know these high ah high profile crimes 

147.60 153.16 A: ah you know maybe if they could you know ah maybe it could deter 

153.44 156.04 A: you know ah people for you know 

156.27 159.39 A: from [noise] from you know from committing things like this 

159.45 160.43 B: yeah 

161.14 162.43 A: well hopefully 

161.26 166.70 B: i sometimes wonder though if it um if it sometimes ends up kinda glorifying it though 

166.61 169.64 A: right well that that's true that's true 

169.45 170.48 B: yeah 

169.78 172.67 A: as well [noise] it ah 

171.24 172.19 B: yeah 

172.72 175.31 A: [cough] it does that that's a good point too 

175.72 180.13 A: but actually we ah own a ah i live in i'm in tennessee 

175.74 176.74 B: yeah 

179.83 180.79 B: oh really 

180.55 187.66 A: and ah we had a ah we had a guy here who was a who was a fast food ah serial 

188.28 192.80 A: ah killer and they actually televised his trial here on the local station 

192.55 193.69 B: oh really 

193.26 196.93 A: uh-huh and it was actually in a town that i lived in 

197.20 202.97 A: and ah grew up in and where he committed these murders was not a mile maybe a mile and a half from my house 

202.67 204.38 B: wow that's kinda scary 

204.05 206.50 A: yeah it is and it you know it was 

207.78 210.84 A: i mean they convicted him and he's on death row now 

210.86 211.91 B: oh really 

211.19 220.23 A: and they almost put him to death i think it was about a week or two ago and they got a stay at the last minute but ah 

217.78 219.08 B: oh okay 

220.32 229.88 A: but that was pretty you know it wasn't nationwide or anything but it was you know here in ah here in our local middle tennessee area that was a pretty big you know pretty big deal 

229.56 230.51 B: yeah 

230.68 236.04 B: i actually the thing i did like about them um televising o. j. simpson's case 

230.87 231.64 A: (( so )) 

235.97 237.56 A: right 

236.05 237.37 B: is um 

237.41 244.08 B: [cough] 'cause it had a lot of the focus on it was basically it was about domestic violence and ah 

241.46 242.36 A: right 

243.26 244.17 A: uh-huh 

244.45 249.70 B: so i think that was good that it was televised in the sense that it gave more um 

249.78 256.16 B: it it opened that up more to show you know domestic violence and to kinda bring that to the surface 

253.33 254.33 A: right 

254.39 255.25 A: right 

256.06 257.21 A: sure 

257.07 257.99 B: so 

257.22 267.60 A: well and that that really did too there [noise] and that you know that the only thing with him you know [noise] i mean with him you know getting away with doing you know 

267.73 280.47 A: i mean whether he's you know i i think it you know looking back hindsight being twenty twenty i think we all realise you know that [cough] i mean i myself personally i mean i think he did it 

279.80 280.74 B: yeah 

280.51 283.18 A: i mean in and i mean that's just you know 

283.29 291.60 A: it's it's it's terrible because that was a real blow i think to the you know to the to the ah you know 

292.14 293.03 A: (( ah )) 

293.13 296.38 A: i guess what i'm trying to say is ah the 

297.07 299.81 A: you know the wife abusers 

299.52 300.56 B: mhm 

300.22 310.02 A: you know that really ah or to the battered wives i mean it really you know it was really a hard hit to them because to see him do that and then get away 

306.37 307.41 B: mhm 

310.08 314.26 A: you know with doing that that you know that really that really put a damper 

314.39 316.24 A: i think 

314.53 320.10 B: yeah it did ah i think one thing it did do though is is make it um 

320.57 330.35 B: for those who are um abusive kinda ma- shows that you know things are i think maybe the courts decided to kinda tighten up on things a little bit though 

329.81 330.79 A: right 

330.66 331.96 B: which is good 

330.78 345.63 A: right and that's very and one thing i'll have to say that i am that i am proud of and this is you know the that was as far as the o. j. simpson trial is concerned i mean as far as the n._f._l. is concerned i mean they have not touched him with a ten foot pole 

345.17 347.01 B: oh i know which is great 

346.35 351.56 A: i mean he has just been you know he is i mean just about ostracized from the n._f._l. 

351.16 352.27 B: mhm 

352.00 355.13 A: so i mean that is you know that is a plus 

354.77 356.32 B: yeah exactly 

356.23 361.24 A: so but ah and like i say i'm sure we haven't seen the ah 

357.17 357.96 B: (( um )) 

361.17 374.97 A: the last of these like i say these high profile ah cases on t._v. you know i think the more that ah you know the more that that things happen it you know this is probably going to be a trend that unfortunately that we're gonna be seeing 

374.68 375.60 B: right 

375.36 387.58 A: ah but like you said i do think that it you know the sometimes it you know sometimes it it's our our eyes are are are less better you know outside the courtroom i think sometimes 

386.94 387.98 B: (( yeah [cough] )) 

387.60 391.62 A: you know there may be a time and place for it but ah 

391.71 398.38 A: but i think in some cases ah the camera is probably best left outside 

397.77 408.56 B: yeah i think it kinda depends on how the media handles it and and how it's done but i think generally it can tend to get it can be you know interesting and they can really you know 

401.60 402.57 A: right 

402.75 403.71 A: right 

405.74 406.68 A: because 

408.55 414.64 B: ah use it for good but i think they usually end up um sort of glorifying it in a way 

414.32 416.40 A: right right exactly 

415.09 415.99 B: (( you know )) 

416.79 417.74 A: (( oh well )) 

416.89 417.68 B: but 

417.99 422.21 A: well this is pretty cool i've enjoyed doing these [laughter] these discussions 

421.71 423.98 B: yeah how many have you done 

422.95 429.40 A: it's ah they've called ah they've called us they've called me quite a bit the last couple of weeks 

429.27 430.45 B: oh really 

430.06 438.45 A: yeah i guess they were my wife says they're ah they were kinda kind of uh needing male participants so 

430.74 431.77 B: how many 

438.30 439.32 B: yeah 

439.62 440.61 A: but ah 

440.65 443.60 B: oh i didn't see now i thought you could only do three 

441.17 441.90 A: no 

443.42 446.43 A: oh really yeah three like in a 

447.45 449.00 A: [noise] is it three ah 

449.31 453.11 A: three in a month or a week or a day or how is it 

451.29 456.70 B: no i think three is the all that you can do but maybe that's just all that you can get paid for is the three 

456.50 457.66 A: oh okay 

457.67 459.52 B: yeah i mean i dunno i i 

459.59 463.28 B: i'd check it out a little bit more but yeah this is actually my third one um
