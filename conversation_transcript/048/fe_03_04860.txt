1.32 2.25 B: (( hi )) 

3.49 6.15 B: hi this is uh debbie how are you doing 

6.02 8.00 A: good debbie good 

7.42 8.43 B: (( good )) 

8.32 9.34 A: um 

9.72 16.17 A: yeah what the topic was um how would we how do we think we would um react or people would react during a terrorist attack 

15.62 17.40 B: yes yes 

17.52 21.68 A: um yeah i don't know what do you think [laughter] 

19.49 21.28 B: [laughter] 

21.73 26.12 B: i know wow um [lipsmack] i think 

26.98 33.01 B: considering of what had happened in new york um 

33.08 41.38 B: i think the majority of people would probably panic considering even you know how a lot of people reacted in the year two thousand for on y. two k 

41.35 43.50 A: right that's true 

43.69 49.78 A: that's true i guess you know we do have a real good um example of with uh nine eleven 

50.06 51.35 A: and uh 

51.53 53.72 A: you know people did seem to kinda 

53.93 56.51 A: get pretty panicky about it i mean 

56.98 65.04 A: in a sense i mean i i didn't the people around me though didn't seem to but it seemed like when you watched the news it portrayed that 

63.14 65.46 B: (( right with the cameras )) 

65.49 66.45 A: yeah 

66.07 66.99 B: (( in new york )) 

67.18 70.43 B: yeah and um where we live 

71.17 75.37 B: it was more like a somber i think but um [lipsmack] i 

73.19 74.14 A: yeah 

75.69 82.38 B: worked in the travel business and i know that um a lotta people um were scared to fly 

82.32 83.31 A: yeah 

82.71 86.84 B: but then some people it didn't affect so it's kinda really hard to say i think that um 

87.15 97.17 B: it depends what part of the states i mean country you're from i think if you're close to new york where it happened um i think you would probably get a different reaction would you think so 

97.02 98.70 A: yeah i think um 

99.10 110.06 A: you know i don't know i'm i'm one that thinks that you know right after something like that it's almost like the safest time you know that it's really you know what the law of averages and stuff i've never really 

110.00 119.68 A: imag- i've never thought it's possible for me to get hurt in a plane you know no matter what and even on something like that it's more so okay now that's over 

114.88 115.99 B: right 

119.78 126.79 A: but i think the people are gonna be afraid of that type of thing have always have always been and kinda would react then 

126.85 127.99 B: right 

127.17 129.36 A: you know based on uh 

129.83 138.70 A: you know just carrying out with uh like i say i think i think actually they the more media you watch the more you're inclined to get more 

138.63 145.23 A: you know worried about things like that and to react you know in a in a frightening way because it really shows 

141.56 143.00 B: right right 

145.22 154.80 A: you know it just plays this uh story over and over again i mean i couldn't stop watching it 'cause i wanted to get it all in but you could see how it could really feel like wow 

151.93 152.99 B: right 

154.67 157.79 B: right you know i do think too i i think 

157.88 164.47 B: we're pretty lucky these days i mean if you look back in history there was always war there was always um 

163.26 164.18 A: yeah 

164.81 175.29 B: [lipsmack] devastating things happening and really the last one hundred years um there have been some wars but i don't think as much as 

175.04 176.80 A: yeah 

175.73 179.72 B: and and suffering as it used to be i mean 'cause 

179.76 194.01 A: well even if you go back like what you're i i think i know what you're if you go back to say like right after like uh world war two you know that's fifty years and really there hasn't been much you know as far as world wars you know i mean 

187.03 188.01 B: mhm 

192.59 194.58 B: right right and um 

194.88 201.68 B: and whereas in other countries you know they're always there's there's a lot of fighting and um so america 

202.32 211.51 B: uh i i think has been pretty good for the last basically we think i think we're just so accustomed thinking that everything is going to be perfect 

211.58 216.28 B: and um or untouchable and 

214.17 215.16 A: yeah 

216.53 222.74 B: and really it's not that you know i think that um [lipsmack] just like for instance 

222.77 225.92 B: (( the s. a. r. s. s. a. r. s. disease )) 

224.74 226.60 A: (( right yeah s. a. r. s. )) 

226.28 227.35 B: (( um )) 

228.13 239.14 B: you know look at before how many people when the influenza it hit you know all all the people and um the suffering of what our great great grandparents or grandparents 

232.90 233.79 A: right 

238.89 247.99 A: it still kills more people influenza in in the traditional types of thing rather than s. a. r. s. i mean we have a chin- in a chinatown in uh 

239.37 240.09 B: and 

243.81 245.03 B: mhm 

248.27 251.84 A: in uh chicago it's like the business is dead 

251.72 252.86 B: mhm 

251.80 256.84 A: yet nobody's died here you know from that and um so 

253.89 255.00 B: mhm 

256.80 264.75 A: so i think people in a lotta ways you know we're getting back to just the um you know the point of how they would react you know is that uh 

264.57 277.33 A: people do get a comfort level and then when it's like if it's really you're talking about it really you know continuing i mean nine eleven was one you know it happened in in basically in a moment you know and then it 

276.77 277.89 B: right 

277.28 285.94 A: was done it wasn't like after that it wasn't you know continual so if there's something where all of a sudden you know a series of days went on 

281.76 282.67 B: right 

286.02 286.85 B: right 

286.04 293.38 A: where once a day something was happening you know whether it be dirty bombs or something like that i think people could um 

293.59 303.81 A: i think the original reaction could be pretty um pretty bad you know and i think though but i also think though that people given a chance to get used to it 

297.79 299.28 B: right right 

303.91 306.48 A: you know i think we're i think people um 

306.60 310.04 A: especially like americans i think you know and and i'm not saying 

310.26 318.64 A: i'm not you know trying to sorta make us different than others but i mean you know 'cause they they probably do it too but i think you toughen up a little bit and 

318.04 319.20 B: mhm 

318.49 325.34 A: you know you lose a little and you realize well you know what are we going do you know we gotta we've gotta live with it so 

322.98 324.36 B: right right 

325.51 328.87 B: and i know um for myself i'm a christian and i 

328.90 335.72 B: and i know the churches all around us it brought a lotta people [laughter] back to church and and focusing on um 

332.72 333.72 A: yeah 

336.92 340.18 B: [lipsmack] you know where your foundation is and kinda get you 

340.39 341.85 B: you know that 

342.42 345.88 B: not everything's gonna be okay and um 

346.76 348.56 B: and things like that you 

349.39 350.42 B: know 

349.42 354.08 A: what i'm i'm sorry what was the f- the the focus was that not everything's gonna be okay 

353.63 355.60 B: um i know i i've 

355.59 369.50 B: lost my train of thought that um not always everything's gonna be okay but i know i said that kinda word that everything's gonna be okay but um who our f- focus on like well god for me 

360.44 361.33 A: oh

372.15 373.93 B: and um 

374.22 378.43 B: he's not going to change whereas things all around us could change 

377.71 382.14 A: yeah yeah we're we're paying our dues i mean the world's had 

382.88 389.18 A: you know had stuff going you know throughout history i mean stuff happens and somehow we think well 

386.09 387.36 B: mhm 

389.30 392.31 A: you know and and these happen but you still uh 

392.04 393.38 B: mhm 

392.61 399.01 A: you know still people would say i mean you know i think i think whatever you wherever you get your faith 

399.07 403.83 A: people with you know whether they you know whether they get it through a religion or 

404.15 410.22 A: some form of faith even just in human nature and humanity which is some form of that you know that they 

405.59 406.83 B: right right 

407.01 408.28 B: right right 

409.57 410.55 B: mhm 

410.37 424.84 A: they're stronger survivors you know and they will find try and make some form of sense of it rather than to be you know the person who you know in the typical action movie there's always the person screaming we're all gonna die you know [laughter] and it's like 

412.45 413.59 B: right right 

420.01 420.69 B: right 

420.86 421.57 B: (( right ))

426.17 427.36 A: yeah 

426.91 434.80 B: um like for instance i mentioned like y. two k. and that and it's like people are always looking for something you know like um to fill 

432.02 433.06 A: yeah 

435.17 441.50 B: you know like they have a hole or whatever in their life they're looking for this and the answer like when something like oh 

442.22 454.26 B: like y. two k. they're saying like they're gonna lose their money [laughter] they're gonna lose everything see they just feel like they don't have control then they kinda get all stressed out and looking for ways to you know i know where we live 

454.27 458.92 B: um a lotta people sold their houses and moved up north or you know
