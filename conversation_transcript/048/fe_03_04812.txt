252.59 258.69 B: yeah well here's a thing that's relates to the conversation about uh smoking and non smoking 

255.93 256.78 A: (( [laughter] )) 

258.74 268.24 B: most of the uh manufacturers don't put ashtrays and uh lighters in the cars anymore yeah they haven't been doing that for uh i'd say the last two years 

263.68 264.91 A: really 

268.47 270.87 B: in a big way in a real big way 

268.71 269.34 A: (( mm )) 

271.20 276.08 B: here's the reason why though eighty percent of the people that were leasing cars 

277.26 278.48 B: (( their )) 

278.50 287.25 B: leasing companies didn't want the cars coming back off the lease smelling like smoke or with burn holes imbedded in the seats and all 

284.21 286.10 A: right 

286.91 288.10 A: exactly 

287.38 291.31 B: the value of the car because they've got to send it to an auction to sell anyway 

291.33 293.09 A: right 

291.57 292.37 B: so 

292.73 296.66 B: there goes part of the advocates against smoking 

296.45 298.59 A: right that makes sense 

296.79 298.01 B: (( you know and )) 

298.28 300.84 B: yeah it really does 

301.36 304.31 B: but even i still 

304.82 307.78 B: am a smoker so i would prefer to have 

308.00 311.35 B: the capability of smoking at my leisure 

312.58 319.76 B: i mean if if if the confines permits i'll spoke it in the open air you know if it doesn't then i'll tr- 

312.64 313.68 A: right 

319.86 321.76 B: i'll make an attempt to 

321.79 326.67 B: go as far away from you know everybody as possible you know what i mean 

325.05 326.43 A: right 

326.96 328.34 A: (( yeah 'cause all )) 

327.25 330.17 B: i will do that 'cause that's courtesy itself 

329.80 339.18 A: right see i've my lungs are horrible from the secondhand smoke and it really kills me 'cause i'm a music major and i sing so 

333.60 335.02 B: mhm 

338.39 339.15 B: (( oh )) 

339.48 343.64 A: i have to have good lungs and it's really hurting me 

340.80 343.23 B: yeah you need 'em clean and open 

343.33 345.53 B: yeah i understand that mhm 

348.04 352.74 B: unfortunately i don't have the power in myself to put 'em down 

353.00 353.90 A: mm 

353.41 354.69 B: you know so 

354.69 356.33 A: that's a shame 

355.50 364.16 B: yeah well i feel i feel just as bad believe me no uh we have a doctor up there that you know they put some needles in your ear 

358.90 359.70 A: [laughter] 

364.65 370.18 B: and what they can do is try and help you to prevent you from smoking they say it takes away your urge 

370.46 371.13 A: mm 

370.62 372.55 B: so but the waiting list 

371.16 373.26 A: (( kinda like acu- acupuncture )) 

373.01 380.27 B: it it's something similar to that they they hit some nerve and it's i think some form of hypnotism in- involved in it to [cough] 

380.07 382.57 A: oh that's that's interesting 

380.66 381.71 B: you know 

382.22 387.83 B: but uh the guy's been booming with business there's a waiting list to get to him 

385.18 386.07 A: [laughter] 

387.59 388.96 A: i'm sure 

388.18 389.47 B: yeah so 

390.10 400.85 B: i mean everybody knows that smoke itself directly you know to the individual smokers is gonna kill 'em you know we uh we know that as a smoker too 

397.90 399.03 A: right 

401.16 403.66 B: and we don't have the sense enough 

403.77 404.53 A: (( [laughter] )) 

404.06 405.75 B: to stop 

405.80 416.68 B: or we don't have the belief it has to be some dramatic something happening within ourselves in our bodies that forces us to stop immediately you know 

412.59 413.57 A: right 

416.71 417.40 A: mm 

417.04 420.97 B: and it's sad it's sad when i think about it now 

421.28 423.90 B: why i'm doing that to myself 

423.72 424.74 A: [laughter] 

424.11 425.17 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

426.68 434.02 B: well i hope that uh this guy can get me on the list real soon you know i do want to stop though 

434.74 438.96 B: but how do i feel about secondhand smoke if i had stopped 

438.97 447.20 B: i would think that as bad as it smells to people that don't smoke i guess i i would start to notice it you know so 

450.14 451.48 B: game over 

451.55 453.25 A: yeah
