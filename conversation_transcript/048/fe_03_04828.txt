3.62 4.98 B: good thanks 

5.06 10.58 A: um i guess the topic is ah i guess well how would we we would react after a terrorist attack 

8.92 9.76 B: right 

10.20 10.97 B: uh-huh 

10.67 13.27 A: well i certainly think we are without question 

13.25 27.48 A: ah ah ah most people acknowledge it that we're most definitely better prepared now than of course nine eleven or pre-nine eleven and i think we would naturally there'd be some degree of panic but most certainly not near the 

17.80 18.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

21.47 22.42 B: mhm 

27.39 42.31 A: i guess the degree we had ah post-nine eleven and ah i guess it would be controlled panic so to speak ah for the most part you may have isolated incidences of people out of control but i think we would certainly be ah better prepared to ah 

29.18 29.98 B: right 

42.09 43.44 A: handle things 

42.92 46.23 B: mm right i agree i think it probably woke people up a lot too 

46.89 50.13 B: were you personally affected at all from nine eleven or not 

49.34 57.75 A: well i i would ah actually for i._b._m. well in which used to be ah well not i._b._m. did but i worked for price waterhouse coopers 

57.19 58.00 B: uh-huh 

57.93 62.02 A: and we had at the time five consultants or 

61.79 62.74 B: mhm 

62.14 65.10 A: people within the firm killed on four of the flights 

64.49 65.89 B: mhm 

65.22 71.96 A: so we had a partner and some young people ah on those flights coming from various places so 

66.90 67.70 B: right 

72.03 75.53 A: i guess professionally yes personally ah 

74.69 75.52 B: right 

75.57 78.82 A: yes also because we have a lot of clients down in the ah 

79.56 82.85 A: you know the financial district and it postponed 

80.82 81.98 B: mhm 

82.91 91.66 A: delayed or even cancelled some of our implementations and basically ah set us back financially which had an impact 

86.64 87.43 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

91.73 105.19 A: on things like bonuses and things of that nature so ah yeah i guess it directly and indirectly impacted me but i didn't have any you know relatives or friends killed then as far as i didn't know who these five people were are 

93.36 94.33 B: right 

100.51 102.32 B: (( not personally yeah )) 

104.61 105.51 B: right 

105.54 112.89 B: [noise] it didn't affect it didn't affect me personally either but um i was actually at the park that day with my daughter and um 

112.84 125.90 B: i heard someone talking about the airplanes and whenever i got home i just i don't think i would panic in a situation like that but i mean even though it didn't affect me i just remember i was so excited for my husband to get home at the end of that day and i don't know just for us to 

125.64 129.41 A: are you from the area i assume are you from the area 

126.14 128.04 B: be together i'm sorry 

128.98 130.47 B: no i'm not 

130.10 141.59 A: okay well i ah i live in the area actually south jersey and ah been up to new york tonnes of times as a matter of fact i was in an apartment on the upper east side ah up till august for an 

130.86 132.13 B: (( no i'm not but )) 

132.86 133.66 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

133.93 134.76 B: uh-huh 

139.21 140.00 B: uh-huh 

141.85 146.28 A: engagement we had up there not a engagement engagement but a project engagement and 

145.56 146.37 B: right 

146.60 152.96 A: i guess i wasn't in any danger up there ah you know as far as where i was located but i certainly ah 

149.08 150.26 B: mhm 

153.58 159.72 A: you know it was definitely chilling you know the day i sat here ah 'cause i'm a consultant so we have 

155.24 156.13 B: mhm 

160.31 174.35 A: it's called the beach and you're just home and my partner called you know we had we had partners at the time and they called me up and i told him ah i said you won't believe this i said but i don't think you're going to new york today because 

162.59 163.63 B: mhm 

166.72 167.82 B: mhm 

174.33 177.27 A: a couple of planes just went into the world trade centre 

176.75 177.79 B: (( [noise] right )) 

177.28 182.93 A: and he he was he was like astonished i heard like dead ssilence for a minute he said you're kidding me and i said no 

183.18 195.75 A: so it was very unsettling i don't think ah we were obviously lax about things and you know in hind sight you could say well we should have done this and should have done that but i think anyone would agree that we probably should have been 

184.86 185.99 B: mhm 

188.20 189.08 B: right 

191.86 192.45 B: (( mm )) 

196.31 206.32 A: ah you know heeded some more of the advice you hear that was out there and maybe not been to the level of how we are now but i think along a little bit more not that i'm a defence expert 

199.31 200.51 B: right 

202.19 203.20 B: right 

205.90 206.81 B: (( mhm mm )) 

206.48 208.48 A: or anything but i mean 

208.72 213.55 A: you know based on our status around the world you know especially in the ah 

213.65 220.76 A: middle east how we're thought of by a lot of these countries and threats that were out there you know i guess during the clinton administration and even prior 

220.80 223.64 A: we probably should have been a little bit more prepared 

223.06 223.92 B: right 

224.11 226.16 A: but i think at this stage we are 

226.77 230.94 A: without question ah you know as you just watching as even with these ah 

230.97 240.13 A: you know recent events where they raised the level up ah people are more prepared to to to what would happen at least mentally i i assume to some extent physically 

237.26 238.11 B: right 

239.74 241.04 B: mhm 

240.56 247.63 A: i don't think i'm going to go out and buy [laughter] you know bags for my windows and whatever else they had going on out there as far as ah 

242.62 243.89 B: [laughter] 

244.25 245.33 B: right 

246.74 247.93 B: (( right mm )) 

247.79 256.67 A: you know defence mechanisms like at at a resident level but you know i'm certainly more aware of things when i'm you know out there especially since i i travel 

253.43 254.46 B: mhm 

256.17 260.30 B: right you probably must frequently travel on airplanes and [laughter] 

258.92 264.48 A: yeah i actually ah well i was i got assigned to a project in tennessee and ah 

263.10 264.04 B: mhm 

265.05 269.49 A: i can tell you know the that i was flying out of phili every monday at six a._m. and i can tell you 

269.79 271.53 A: you know the airports were i 

271.97 279.32 A: mean the lines even at five thirty in the morning when i was there at five o'clock actually were you know ridiculous to an extent it got better 

274.03 274.91 B: mhm 

279.40 285.47 A: ah i think you know we had a couple of flights delayed because of things but you could see even at the airports 

285.13 286.13 B: right 

285.53 287.76 A: that if something went down 

287.44 288.93 B: mhm 

288.50 298.74 A: so to speak ah we'd be definitely ready and you know you'd always get the people who you know have never been in these situations as much as they've practised it or seen it on t._v. and know that we're pretty much 

289.37 289.96 B: (( if )) 

296.18 297.04 B: mhm 

298.85 307.81 A: you know we've got most of our bases covered i think you would still get people running around scrambling you know especially in a public setting 

304.29 305.25 B: yeah 

306.90 308.12 B: [sigh] right 

307.94 310.00 A: but ah fortunately ah 

308.68 309.44 B: what was 

310.43 319.04 A: ah you know you hear all this talk about you know we should have known we knew it was coming that bush knew it was coming i mean you hear these conspiracy theories now too 

318.80 325.09 B: right it's it's still amazing to hear like you know all the different threats that they get every day i can't even imagine how they even 

319.32 320.80 A: (( a a lot of )) 

325.67 327.65 B: filter through all of them and you know 

326.93 341.68 A: well they they certainly like a lot of them are uncorroborated or or well we don't know they're not the they're not the and i guess you can understand that because let's face it it's not like they're sitting there and they're bugging a person and osama bin laden's phone and they hear him say you know we're going to hit ah 

329.48 330.73 B: mhm 

335.13 336.01 B: mhm 

338.29 339.11 B: right 

342.06 346.18 A: some place x. in three weeks you know you just hear 

344.38 345.76 B: mhm 

345.79 346.55 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

346.19 355.83 A: bits and pieces of if intelligence i guess so from that to that they cannot i guess be exact about but they can certainly you know put us on alert which you know 

355.88 359.87 A: they've obviously done i guess you know the only question i have is 

360.22 364.38 A: ah we'll never rub out terrorism but do you think we're over at least ah a- 

365.09 371.50 A: get get it get it down to the point where we have it under contro- you know at least under somewhat of a control i 

370.66 374.95 B: (( yeah there's always going to be crazy people out there that [laughter] )) 

371.61 378.13 A: mean i i it's almost like the mafia you you you can bite off their head or arm but another arm grows back 

375.59 376.51 B: mhm 

377.56 378.63 B: mhm 

378.45 381.18 A: so i guess we'll never fully have them under control 

381.22 382.78 B: (( i don't think so either )) 

381.47 384.13 A: or at least we can monitor them i guess i don't know 

383.93 385.06 B: (( yeah )) 

385.42 387.42 A: so to that end i guess ah 

388.17 394.28 A: at some point ah but at least like where where unfortunately it took something like that too you know better prepare us 

394.59 396.74 A: i don't know if it could have been any worse or 

396.28 400.44 B: right well i don't know um it's amazing to me to think back you know i've learned since then and 

400.71 406.89 B: it's amazing to me to think how vulnerable vul- vulnerable we were before you know with i 

407.60 420.61 A: and of course let's face it you know these things were months in the planning and it wasn't your conventional means of i guess terrorism you know where you're flying a taking over but i mean when you see some of the things that went on 

409.46 410.26 B: (( don't know )) 

411.49 412.39 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

415.61 416.50 B: right 

416.65 417.52 B: right 

420.90 425.85 A: you had to raise eyebrows i mean these guys coming from middle eastern countries 

422.47 423.29 B: right 

425.45 426.72 B: right 

425.96 433.20 A: with ah you know even the i._n._s. was somewhat lax and then the thing that gets me though is you get some of these 

433.19 444.94 A: u._s. liberals not that i have anything against liberals but oh w- we're infringing upon rights well the thing is when something like this happens some of that's thrown out the window i mean if you go to israel 

435.74 436.92 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

438.41 440.32 B: right [laughter] 

442.70 443.66 B: right 

445.46 446.21 B: (( i agree )) 

445.55 456.04 A: and i've never been there but i could tell you this much you're not going to have you're not going to be floating around doing what you want um you know if it if if it was one of these ah middle eastern countries and they had say a 

456.25 459.63 A: caucasian guy who was the you know behind things or 

459.44 460.51 B: mhm 

459.87 469.71 A: several cauca- do you think that they would just ignore or treat most caucasians like they would like a native middle easterner of course not they'd be ah 

466.38 469.25 B: (( mhm right they're going to be concerned [mn] )) 

469.68 470.74 B: (( mhm )) 

470.11 471.74 A: they'd be profiled 

471.17 472.37 B: mhm 

471.74 485.64 A: and it's an unfortunate thing that helps that it that they will probably retard the ah immigration here and but y- you can't blame the americans it's basically something that was brought upon us and it's either us 

478.20 479.16 B: mhm 

485.87 492.67 A: worrying about our homeland or turning around and saying well we should really ah worry about the immigrants too you know let's 

492.82 501.24 A: you know we gotta worry about here first and then if the immigration is paused or slowed down that's that's unfortunate but you can't blame you know us 

499.08 499.89 B: right 

500.19 507.38 B: it's not really something we can fix [laughter] it's not really something we can fix considering you know what someone else did to us so 

502.25 503.27 A: i'm sorry 

504.80 505.98 A: right i mean 

506.65 511.51 A: my grandparents were immigrants but you know we came they were italian but we didn't ah 

511.86 519.06 A: come from i mean they came here and earned everything they got and worked hard and were never you know any type of ah 

514.87 515.68 B: (( mm mm )) 

519.10 523.05 A: posed for as a threat whereas right now i guess ah 

520.40 521.39 B: (( right mhm )) 

523.71 528.82 A: you know it's unfortunate to ah profile but you know where do you draw the fine line 

529.13 531.61 A: you know i i think they should definitely tighten 

532.18 534.58 A: i mean immigration more so than ah 

534.65 543.18 A: and it's unfortunate because the government agencies get tagged with you know being lax and lazy and when you see what went wrong with i._n._s. 

539.33 540.20 B: (( mhm mm mhm mhm )) 

543.33 544.95 A: with some of these things 

545.15 556.89 A: terrorist related or not unfortunately they in some cases might deserve you know tags like that because you know the the i._n._s. record keeping and gate keeping was weak 

557.13 558.03 A: you know 

557.81 561.69 B: mhm i wonder how i wonder how e- easy it is now for them to 

562.16 565.79 B: um enter our country you know people from the middle east and i don't know what 

565.77 567.03 A: to get in here 

566.98 569.58 B: yeah i mean i wonder if the process is um 

569.32 577.10 A: well it's probably with our question revised it's been revised and it probably is in the process of being revised and i would have to say that 

572.32 573.22 B: mhm 

574.53 575.55 B: mhm 

577.68 590.13 A: you know the money we're going to spend doing checking someone's background i'm thinking you know between that the war and everything else all this this money is just pouring out here when you got we have i think internal problems 

580.39 581.36 B: right 

583.90 585.99 B: right [laughter] 

587.90 588.89 B: mhm 

589.57 590.69 B: mhm 

590.51 599.00 A: so i'd almost be like be like okay if we have the money well put it otherwise just you can't keep the people out but i guess you would have to 

596.97 597.85 B: right 

599.23 599.89 A: put
