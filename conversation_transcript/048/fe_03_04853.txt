0.25 2.02 B: hi i'm kim 

2.17 3.87 A: hi i'm lee 

4.49 5.37 B: hey 

5.35 6.90 A: how you doing 

6.58 7.73 B: pretty well 

7.42 9.30 A: where do you live around 

8.94 11.13 B: um chicago what about you 

9.89 15.61 A: yeah me me too in the far north suburbs up by gurnee and great america 

15.56 18.05 B: okay i go to north western i'm in evanston 

17.70 19.15 A: i see 

19.19 20.52 B: yeah 

19.91 23.38 A: so how do you think most people react in a terrorist attack 

23.62 24.54 B: um 

24.74 32.95 B: i i guess probably the same way they've always reacted and i i don't feel that it's possible to rea- remain calm during a terrorist attack 

32.34 34.42 A: right 

33.39 36.23 B: people's greatest fear in life happens to be death 

36.10 37.09 A: uh-huh 

37.22 46.00 B: and even if there are other fears that that surround it like such as you know flying the basis of why you you're afraid of flying is you're afraid to die 

41.67 42.67 A: uh-huh 

45.64 50.62 A: right it's not the taking off and landing it's the crashing right [laughter] 

48.56 49.65 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

49.81 59.40 B: [noise] [laughter] yeah it's you know as long as you're taking off and landing safely you're happy but the basis of life is to continue living and that's that's a primal instinct 

56.76 58.03 A: right 

58.79 73.44 A: yeah well part of my job involves some evacuation planning and emergency planning and stuff and i think that you know even though you know we practice and do evacuation drills and stuff like that it probably all goes out the window in you know under real circumstances 

64.37 65.29 B: really 

73.55 75.55 B: wait where do you where do you work 

75.32 77.87 A: ah i work for the federal government 

77.43 78.85 B: oh interesting 

78.10 83.53 A: and part of my job is to do building evacuations two or three times a year 

83.61 90.01 A: and just familiarize everybody with ah the exits and the stairways and and that sort of thing 

89.99 97.76 B: how have you been um like like in in reaction to the terrorist attacks how has your job suffered or changed 

97.55 99.39 A: how has my job suffered 

99.18 101.36 B: or changed like as a result 

99.91 100.78 A: changed 

101.28 102.61 A: um 

103.52 109.25 A: well we're always ah on high alert you know you hear about the terrorist levels you know going to orange and all this 

109.48 111.34 A: and we're just ah 

111.53 119.47 A: always at a high level um we're you know in downtown chicago in a federal facility so our guard is always up 

119.32 120.22 B: mhm 

119.64 123.72 A: and we've increased our staff from um 

124.17 128.02 A: fifty armed officers to sixty seven since nine eleven 

125.91 126.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

127.48 133.98 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] so wait what i'm thinking is so where so you're in agreement with with where i stand 

133.61 140.53 A: oh yeah i think that you know all common sensibilities go out the window and stuff in in a real situation 

140.85 145.02 A: um no matter how much you plan for it ah 

144.81 156.63 A: you don't know until it you know the shit hits the fan so to speak [noise] and [noise] you know we we have relocation points and stuff where people can go to meet and be accounted for 

149.08 150.38 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

156.58 162.59 A: but i think in reality everybody's just gonna wanna try and get home or try and call and their families and let 'em know they're okay 

162.88 164.32 B: right right 

163.78 165.09 A: you know so 

166.21 167.77 B: it's interesting i don't 

166.92 171.60 A: i think it's just human nature you know to wanna you know start heading for home 

172.04 175.72 A: and of course i'll be one of the people that have to stay behind [laughter] but 

175.01 176.10 B: (( [laughter] )) 

176.81 178.01 A: you're a student 

178.12 179.30 B: what's that 

178.68 179.91 A: you're a student 

179.89 181.44 B: yeah yeah 

180.88 182.00 A: okay 

182.63 189.68 B: actually another thing that i i think would kind of be interesting in terms of this is where do you stand politically like do you are you are you republican 

190.03 191.30 B: i don't know you 

190.06 193.22 A: ah i i kind of lean that way 

193.27 196.86 A: n my older age yeah i guess yeah i'm forty six 

196.62 197.38 B: [noise] 

197.52 204.88 B: so do you do you ah like did you support the president through the throughout like what he had done with the terror attacks 

205.04 210.66 A: um yeah i think you know he's a pretty strong leader and you had to do something you know 

206.55 207.70 B: [noise] 

210.87 214.17 A: and i think the worst thing he could do is is nothing at all 

214.74 216.02 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

214.83 216.29 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

217.49 227.43 A: you know i'm i'm a little disappointed with the war in iraq and stuff that we didn't find you know these all these weapons of mass destruction that would've been you know 

227.66 228.86 A: (( there seems to be )) 

227.97 232.47 B: do you think do you think that the weapons of mass destruction actually existed 

232.32 242.98 A: well i think he had some i i think he just might not have had you know as many as we think he's a shifty shifty character you know he probably did a good job of hiding them you know 

242.55 246.54 B: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah [noise] so you you think that they 

244.04 246.35 A: you know i think they're finding traces 

247.39 250.11 B: [noise] 'cause a lot of people tend to think like 

250.32 256.00 B: that that they were used as like a reason to support or espouse this war 

255.70 256.73 A: right 

256.69 261.52 B: and since none were found i guess there is some sort of basis do you agree 

260.12 263.34 A: right like i said i'm a little disappointed that you 

262.99 264.21 B: yeah 

263.63 267.07 A: know but i think we he had to go and ah 

267.94 273.52 A: i think he has a lot of ah terrorist connections and stuff so i 

273.95 275.37 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

274.75 288.14 A: don't know it's a shame so many civilians and stuff had to had to deal with you know the war and destruction and everything but i think you know ten years down the road from now they'll they'll probably be glad we did what we did 

288.07 289.00 B: right 

288.92 290.06 A: yeah 

289.35 294.93 B: what another thing that i found very amusing about the war you can tell me if you agree with this is that ah 

295.75 302.00 B: the the government did nothing to quell this disbelief or like this misbelief rather but a lot [mn] 

302.09 310.29 B: i guess i think the stat was something like sixty five percent of the people thought that iraq had something to do with september eleventh 

309.96 310.99 A: uh-huh 

311.48 314.48 A: i think there's like a money connection there 

311.80 312.69 B: (( like )) 

314.90 321.91 B: i you you oh you believe that too like but they didn't realise but they didn't even realise that it was afghanistan it had nothing to do with iraq 

321.66 322.72 A: uh-huh 

322.67 324.56 B: i just think that's really funny 

324.14 325.91 A: yeah 

325.88 326.86 B: (( i don't know )) 

326.80 328.60 A: so do you feel pretty safe 

329.22 330.81 B: [noise] do i feel safe 

330.19 331.36 A: where you're at 

331.56 334.95 A: [noise] are you like at the lakefront campus in evanston or 

335.01 337.21 B: um yeah yeah 

336.58 337.89 A: well okay 

338.09 339.03 B: i mean 

339.41 348.37 B: in terms of safety like there's even separation for a sars attack like if if if sars were to occur at north western i mean 

344.54 345.60 A: uh-huh 

348.95 353.21 B: we're nowhere near we're nowhere near south east asia nor are we near like 

353.27 356.09 B: [mn] like distinct parts of canada that are 

355.62 358.18 A: ah have you noticed ah 

358.41 359.47 A: you know like 

359.66 363.44 A: any reaction to the you know asian students and stuff 

364.43 365.51 B: um 

365.12 370.43 A: is it [mn] there's talk about like you know they're not going home for the holidays and stuff and

488.62 489.18 A: (( [mn] ))

492.74 502.27 B: yeah the problem is is with terrorism and like something that's kind of an older topic and something that both people agree on like it's difficult to 

500.52 501.44 A: uh-huh 

502.47 505.40 B: continue a conversation it's like yep so we agree 

505.25 506.64 A: yeah 

506.08 507.93 B: [laughter] where do we go from here 

507.53 518.82 A: right well like i said you know working downtown in a federal facility and you know being in law enforcement everything you know it's kind of like job security for me i guess you know 

518.93 519.91 B: yeah 

519.28 520.95 A: um you used 

520.18 526.44 B: no but i really don't think that there'd be anyone that would disagree it's like yeah no nobody cares about terrorism 

526.02 528.91 A: yeah now it's it's on everybody's mind and then 

529.13 530.14 A: (( you know i'm not )) 

529.20 540.01 B: i mean i guess it's not it's not like i don't walk down the street like afraid that there's a terrorist following me but like if i were in a terrorist attack and and like something was gonna explode and i was gonna die like 

540.47 545.78 B: you can't tell me that like anyone would be like no i would just sit there and ah die 

544.98 546.06 A: (( ah )) 

545.83 547.85 B: because like instinct 

547.26 558.97 A: yeah we we we work in the shadows of sears tower too and you know we always imagine a what it would be like if a plane crashed into sears tower and you know we're only a block or two away and 

556.46 557.54 B: yeah 

558.81 562.51 A: how that would be if you know sears tower came down and stuff 

562.58 565.31 A: so it's always on the back of our minds 

564.84 570.42 B: oh yeah like i always i i remember on september eleventh 'cause actually i'm a sophomore this year 

569.90 571.17 A: (( mhm )) 

570.55 575.80 B: so when i moved up to school i had to drive from miami to chicago 

575.33 576.34 A: uh-huh 

576.62 581.71 B: um because um none of the planes were flying like i came up here like september thirteenth 

579.22 580.26 A: right 

581.12 582.14 A: uh-huh 

582.09 595.59 B: and ah i just remember like watching the news and thinking oh god going to chicago is crazy and like my mom was concerned about me taking the l. and like they're they thought that something would happen to the sears tower and like all of sudden it's like this is so cool i'm like moving to a 

592.92 594.25 A: right 

595.74 598.03 B: crazy craziness 

597.56 599.89 A: i've not flown since ah
