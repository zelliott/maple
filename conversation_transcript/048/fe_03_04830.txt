37.44 38.49 A: i'm talking 

43.06 51.48 A: oh you're i i guess that would take in ah you never know what what's going to happen until you actually get there 

50.79 54.70 B: well that's true it's one of those hypothetical things isn't it 

54.11 62.69 A: ah you know but ah you know i yeah the last time you know nine one one was so far away that ah ah but 

61.70 63.69 B: oh yeah i guess it is 

63.79 68.60 A: you know but ah i guess it it effected me emotionally a little bit 

67.92 69.81 B: (( oh yeah oh yeah )) 

68.77 71.79 A: yeah it ah ah you know [mn] 

70.16 71.13 B: me too 

72.79 85.13 A: [sigh] it took me a while to get over it i i i mean i didn't go running around and and ah you know to you know hide and put my hand in ah head in the sand but ah ah 

83.26 84.51 B: yeah 

85.48 89.55 A: it it did take and rock our sole ah our foundations 

89.58 96.79 B: yes yeah it does yeah something like that is a shock you know to anybody that it could even happen 

91.67 92.57 A: yeah 

96.87 98.00 A: right 

97.06 102.30 B: and then to have it happen in your own country you just feel pretty vulnerable ay yeah 

101.89 104.77 A: yeah so ah 

104.65 108.61 B: well in in um in canada we haven't um 

108.79 114.94 B: had any really really big attacks you know but terrorism can happen on 

112.28 113.04 A: oh 

115.02 118.56 B: a a smaller a- a- you know venues too 

118.36 120.16 A: (( oh yeah )) 

119.52 126.40 B: and um you know things get blown up and even people taking hostages on planes 

126.48 132.72 B: that happens a lot so it always makes me when i think of what i would do in attack 

133.57 139.39 B: i don't think i can do anything about not about being in one 'cause you don't have any warning 

139.21 141.10 A: don't have any warning right 

140.43 149.12 B: no that's it it could be anytime anywhere which i think is the whole idea of terrorism but um when i'm in a situation 

149.18 151.33 B: i know how i react 

151.48 157.41 B: not necessarily to terrorism but anything like that's a shock like that i tend to get really quiet 

157.35 158.31 A: oh 

157.49 158.88 B: and calm 

158.93 161.17 B: and my mind starts 

161.65 166.40 B: telling me to behave nice on the outside and start thinking on the inside [laughter] 

166.46 177.34 B: on what you know a- to do or get out of it or how i want it so i think i would probably look like i'm calm on the outside but not on the inside what about you 

174.22 175.34 A: (( ok- )) 

177.52 181.14 A: well i'm a believer that panic kills and 

180.39 185.49 B: yeah that's it in two words you said what i took two minutes to say [laughter] 

185.16 187.03 A: (( [laughter] absolutely )) 

185.58 187.55 B: (( yeah that's right )) 

187.50 195.74 A: panic kills so you know the i was reading the about those people that built the high buildings out of the the steel 

195.80 197.25 B: the high buildings 

196.87 203.00 A: you know you know you know twenty three b- ah you know big buildings where they they put put the steel up first 

198.42 199.35 B: yeah 

202.61 203.52 B: yeah 

203.37 209.10 A: and and the people that do that they have a model they've ah the think quickly move slowly 

209.20 213.64 B: yes that's it that's another way to describe it yeah 

210.10 211.36 A: (( and ah )) 

212.45 222.08 A: right you got to you know think quickly move slowly and ah you know just you got to keep your wits with you yes 

221.36 222.80 B: yeah you do 

222.88 224.31 B: you'd think so 

224.46 238.83 B: like i ah i don't have a- i wouldn't have any power at all but it would be automatic to think that i have to do something but i guess with other people around you'd want to be be calm so that even if um 

234.59 235.48 A: yeah 

238.88 241.21 B: if you want to do something brave 

241.33 251.94 B: or or consider that you have to consider the people around you and as a way of life ah you we as a rule we don't really do that in even in canada and in 

249.34 250.62 A: right 

251.81 256.86 B: and u._s._a. we're kind of a it's all about me society you know 

255.88 256.70 A: yeah 

256.77 267.23 B: and ah we're kind of thinking well you know ah everything's fine i can do what i want but then in a situation where you need a group effort all of a sudden or a group reaction 

256.85 257.58 A: right 

267.15 268.01 A: yeah 

267.38 273.87 B: we're not always that used to it we don't kind of know how to behave or at least i found that i don't necessarily 

273.97 275.33 A: (( um according )) 

273.98 277.16 B: i still think about how i would feel 

276.96 284.72 A: yeah it my my my feeling is the only heros during the nine eleven were on flight ninety three 

284.82 288.78 B: that's for sure my gosh 

286.68 287.63 A: ah 

288.87 289.94 A: (( now they're )) 

289.13 291.47 B: my goodness no kidding 

292.49 300.70 B: to do i don't know you know i think about what they did and it's a documented fact and the names and they'll and i'll tell ya they they are the 

300.92 303.73 B: the heroes the men and the women and the children 

303.72 304.69 A: right 

303.98 308.26 B: and also the people up especially the the guys that made the decision 

308.24 310.10 A: yeah let's roll 

309.77 310.75 B: you know 

311.93 313.43 B: my goodness 

313.34 316.79 A: yeah they saved our ah saved our capital 

316.21 321.34 B: yeah they were headed right for d._c. ay right for the white house 

321.29 328.56 A: yeah some say they were after congress and some say they were after the white house i personally think they were going for the white house 

328.43 331.74 B: well i i don't know which it was but they 

331.75 338.31 B: can you imagine it the information came so fast and the decision had to be made so fast really 

337.28 338.12 A: yeah 

338.33 346.91 B: especially with the communication they had that the you'd have to know it it was kind of a fact before you would do something like that wouldn't you think 

346.75 347.96 A: right 

348.02 358.69 B: and that would be very hard to to know you know you'd have to trust the information and my gosh i'm not sure i could i i don't know if i could make that decision or not 

358.64 362.37 A: you know what you know you ever been to a baseball game on bat day 

363.26 367.91 A: they pass out these little miniature bats that are about two feet long 

368.26 373.23 B: what no i've never i've been to a ball game but not a not one with little bats 

372.89 383.46 A: well they have bat i don't know if they do it in canada or not but they give these ah ah ah ah bats ah on on bat day and they're not real bats they're only about two feet long okay 

382.55 383.66 B: uh-huh 

383.59 388.30 A: and you been in an airplane and they've got that little bag in front 

383.73 384.71 B: yeah 

387.71 388.63 B: yeah 

388.57 390.93 A: where they've got the in flight magazines 

390.57 391.40 B: yeah 

391.18 395.31 A: i think they ought to put a little bat in each one of those ah pouches 

395.02 397.23 B: [laughter] 

397.36 399.68 B: how how would that help [laughter] 

399.24 405.17 A: well you you got a lot of people taking a beating the bad guys over the head with those bats 

404.81 406.61 B: oh that's for sure 

406.41 414.21 A: you know and and and now they're taking you know they're putting guns on the plane as as they're you know talking to you know air marshalls and the pilots 

406.76 408.14 B: that's for sure 

414.13 415.49 B: yeah 

414.88 419.65 A: and so i think little bats would do a lot less damage than a bullet wouldn't you 

419.93 427.28 B: oh i see where you're going yeah yeah a bullet could could pierce the the plane and 

423.15 424.31 A: you know so 

426.87 431.09 A: right you know it could do some hurt but you know the the bats if you're talking 

430.37 431.41 B: [laughter] 

432.41 439.69 A: i would just like to take and if that situation happened to me i would like to be able to have something i could do 

440.39 443.72 B: yeah yeah a part in it sort of 

443.14 445.11 A: just a you know yeah 

444.23 446.13 B: a part in the solution 

446.08 448.27 A: right so 

447.50 452.62 B: yes it it gives us an ah um a feeling that we still have control 

452.56 455.50 A: a little bit anyway not a complete 

453.80 456.14 B: yeah yeah that's true of 

456.40 461.27 B: course it'd be interesting if people started using them on each other when they got angry or something [laughter] 

461.08 466.36 A: well you know in texas ah they have concealed handguns you know i i 

464.87 466.76 B: yes that's true 

466.54 468.95 A: i carry a concealed handgun and ah 

468.14 469.80 B: (( is that right )) 

469.35 480.01 A: and and ah you know when they passed it six years ago they're oh we're going to have pandemonium in the streets they'll be shooting at each other going down the road and and it just hasn't 

469.85 471.08 B: (( is that right )) 

475.16 476.06 B: yeah 

477.43 478.95 B: right right 

479.10 480.59 B: it hasn't happened 

480.23 482.26 A: it just hasn't happened 

481.72 483.77 B: (( oh that's so cool )) 

483.33 492.96 A: and and ah you know the law enforcement there was you know a good majority of them were against it you know those people are going they're going to be shooting at each other they don't know how to handle the guns 

492.35 494.88 B: well right right all right 

493.63 501.97 A: and ah you know six years later i'd say a major majority of the law enforcement segment i don't see any problem in it 

501.41 502.51 B: yeah 

502.34 503.96 A: (( you know and and ah )) 

503.47 505.11 B: that's a big switch 

504.75 516.20 A: yeah and you know the the law the cops have kind of gone on our side and and the thing is it's got to be concealed people don't people don't know if you've got a gun or not 

512.65 513.74 B: yeah 

516.05 519.80 B: no that's right so so so you can't really tell 

517.74 519.36 A: (( and you know violent )) 

519.51 524.28 A: and so violent crimes have gone down where they're trying to hold you up 

523.47 524.94 B: yeah 

524.33 526.04 A: you know now they they 

525.29 526.91 B: (( so that worked out )) 

526.51 534.50 A: and so these they're these same people sneak around and and and they take a and try to get you stuff where you're not there 

533.84 534.90 B: right 

534.81 537.09 A: you know but ah you know 

537.28 546.40 A: if i'm going to get my car stolen i'd just as soon it get stolen [laughter] so that people don't aren't hold- ah holding a gun on me or a knife or whatever you know 

545.66 552.50 B: yes that's for sure that's for sure they do it when you're not around sort of thing and then it helps save the human 

546.93 547.79 A: (( and also )) 

547.92 549.18 A: no it's it's 

550.02 550.72 A: (( right )) 

552.22 559.04 A: right in in fact in the last ah ten years thirty five states have had the similar law 

553.09 553.99 B: well the 

558.97 571.45 B: oh i didn't know that holy doodle well i know you're not supposed to bring guns over the border into canada but gosh what a what a big deal i mean you've got ah one country with absolutely nothing 

560.50 561.46 A: yeah 

564.45 565.50 A: oh they 

571.37 580.69 B: really they they say and then another country with with that you can do it i don't know [laughter] you know how we're going to just take care of that you know 

572.01 572.83 A: yeah 

580.37 589.90 A: well the thing is that you know ah the you know the people aren't whether it's the gunners they they get really uptight about the criminals having guns oh 

589.84 594.78 B: well you know what that's true [laughter] that is true i was ah 

595.03 599.95 B: the the the person here in canada that that was very successful in getting that past no
