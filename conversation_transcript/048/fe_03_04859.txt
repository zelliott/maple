31.60 33.58 A: (( under terrorist circumstances )) 

33.67 40.10 B: (( yeah )) 

34.30 35.95 A: and i think uh 

36.91 40.91 A: depending on what kind of terrorist attack there was 

41.62 45.90 A: but i i think under most conditions people remain pretty calm 

46.11 53.01 B: (( [noise] yeah i i don't know like first of all where where are you from )) 

46.18 47.77 A: and just try to get things

57.61 58.30 A: (( okay )) 

59.65 72.86 B: honestly i think that uh the whole terrorist attack thing at least in new york 'cause i'm from you know actually new york city it it just it's more like um if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen so i don't think people i mean they have all these alerts 

73.05 75.48 B: uh like you know like uh 

76.18 82.17 B: you know pumpkin orange or whatever like alerts have but if it's gonna happen it's gonna people so people can't just like you know live their life in fear 

82.21 86.44 B: so i think people get more freaked out just i guess in the 

82.62 83.41 A: (( right )) 

86.77 92.48 B: concept of it happening but knowing that they like their lives aren't affected like i mean i i do my 

92.49 101.81 B: life every day you know not worrying about anything because it's gonna happen it's gonna be there's nothing the government can do about it you know if they want to do something they're gonna do it so 

98.98 99.84 A: yeah 

101.96 104.75 B: and shit happens it's gonna happen that's the way i think 

103.67 107.17 A: when it happens when it happens do you think people will remain calm or or 

107.31 108.61 A: will they be panicked 

107.57 115.64 B: no people people are gonna be fucking wild i was up in d. c. when um september eleventh happened and i actually go to g. w. in d. c. 

115.75 119.40 B: and like it was ridiculous i actually worked um 

115.80 116.73 A: uh-huh 

119.17 121.31 B: a couple of blocks away from the pentagon and it was 

121.30 124.75 B: ridiculous people were like crying in the streets it was it was crazy 

124.63 125.61 A: really 

124.74 138.74 B: the people were just sitting there like like crying and like you know cops everywhere and like it was fucking it was crisis it was nuts and i was sitting there walking home from my job 'cause like we that that plane that came down in pennsylvania was supposed to come in d. c. and they didn't know where it was coming from 

138.19 140.13 A: (( mm )) 

138.59 149.47 B: so i was actually let home early from work and and people were just so worried and it was crazy so like if anything ever happened people will just flip out 'cause you don't know what's gonna happen you know yeah that's my feeling 

146.92 147.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

148.15 149.32 A: that's true 

150.59 151.43 A: (( huh )) 

151.71 154.60 B: but uh yeah to let that there you go i mean like 

154.87 156.93 B: it just it's 

156.95 159.66 B: you know whatever 

158.40 160.86 A: [mn] so you think like people 

161.20 166.26 A: under the thought of not knowing what was happening that kinda freaks them out a lot 

166.23 172.89 B: i think i think um it matters what kind of person it is i mean you get i mean there's some people that uh 

172.94 185.65 B: you know after the whole september eleventh they kinda like sat there and said like you know what could happen and you know hypothesize and just everything like just you wanna like you know go over all the uh possible like you know 

185.58 196.67 B: problems that could happen but like it's you can't do that because you can't live life like that because there's no way they someone can prevent that if some asshole wants to blow himself up he's gonna blow himself up it's simple that you know 

196.56 203.09 B: there's no way there's no way they can ever prevent it from like and the airline i mean the way that they september eleventh yeah but 

196.72 197.61 A: yeah 

203.14 211.81 B: i mean just the guy walking on on the street wants to blow himself up and take up you know a hundred people it's gonna happen so there's 

210.84 211.67 A: yeah 

211.91 219.62 B: you just can't live your life like in fear i refuse to live my life in fear you know i do my everyday life and just say whatever go with the flow 

219.84 224.28 A: that's good you know something worrying about something you can't can't control 

223.25 225.99 B: what was that sorry i couldn't hear you what 

225.50 228.72 A: there's no sense in worrying about what you can't control 

228.35 238.59 B: yeah exactly if you can't control it you know why worry about it it's kinda like fate you know like you go around in life you have luck and you have bad luck you can't control luck stuff just happens like if you were one of those 

228.77 229.58 A: you know 

238.39 243.81 B: you know unfortunate people on the plane like they had no idea they were going to go into you know they would have 

243.59 253.59 B: it happened to 'em it's like every time you take a plane every time you drive a car every time you walk around the street you don't know if a drunk driver's going to hit you when you walk around you don't know if you're gonna get hit by a car when you drive your car 

244.89 245.85 A: (( yeah )) 

253.42 261.28 B: you don't know if you're gonna get hit by you know someone when you're in a bus or any just you can't live your life in fear and uh 

261.35 264.54 B: (( it's as simple as that and i don't know it's just the way i feel )) 

265.17 268.65 A: yeah i think you're right on that i i feel the same way 

265.29 266.01 B: so 

267.13 270.18 B: yeah i mean like 

270.61 281.99 B: i would feel like a loser if i felt like just just like worried about it all the time you know 'cause if it did happen then like what could be done to prevent it i mean worrying more i mean if you worry more it doesn't do anything you know 

282.16 283.07 A: yeah 

282.51 283.86 B: (( so i don't know )) 

283.29 288.17 A: and and it only freaks out more people if you're like worried all the time too you know 

287.45 290.66 B: exactly i mean if you show that you're like a uh 

291.13 304.81 B: um if you like give support or if you have uh i mean you like you said you can even definitely show people or make them feel better if you feel more confident you know and not worry so you can set an example you can set an example 

300.84 301.67 A: yeah 

302.61 303.45 A: (( if )) 

305.11 314.52 A: you're like a mom or dad or whatever and you've got kids and if you're freaking out all the time they're gonna freak out but if you're cool and just you know whatever happens it happens just 

314.54 316.91 A: your kids will probably be cool too and just 

316.96 319.63 A: you know live their life the way they should be 

317.30 321.26 B: yeah yeah you've gotta set an example 

321.60 322.55 A: (( so yeah )) 

322.39 326.94 B: anyway do you like sports at all or do we have to talk this whole about terrorism are 

326.42 327.34 A: i 

327.38 328.92 A: like sports a little bit 

328.81 330.98 B: (( you into hockey at all or are you basketball ))

353.46 355.92 A: [laughter] many as many as we can you know 

353.76 354.87 B: so anyway 

356.36 361.85 A: but but one one thing they're talking about was like a further terrorist attack like in the staple center 

356.38 358.63 B: it's ridiculous anyway 

360.57 362.37 B: (( yeah )) 

362.00 363.70 A: that'd just be nuts 

364.19 367.70 A: but it's kinda good they have a lot of security and stuff there 

365.24 369.71 B: yeah what you you would be nuts 

370.08 371.15 A: what's that 

370.91 373.72 B: wait what did you say i didn't hear ya i thought you said something 

372.52 373.43 A: uh 

373.77 379.88 A: i'm just saying if if there is a terrorist attack in the like one of the big games like the super ball or something 

379.35 380.30 B: yeah 

380.33 381.94 A: it'd just be crazy 

381.93 387.74 B: yeah well i mean like the thing is with terrorists the way they act is they don't act with 

388.41 395.28 B: i guess expected they don't do expected things i mean that'd be some of the tricks like like you know doing some kinda terrorism 

395.14 405.41 B: in a popular sports event they're more like i mean you wouldn't expect it to happen you know that's that's the way they that's the way they do things so i don't think it would really happen you know at like a 

397.22 398.09 A: yeah 

402.29 403.24 A: yeah 

405.71 411.01 B: professional um event or at the grammies the oscars or you know whatever you know 

411.59 420.12 B: because we're all over that it's it's the things you don't think about it's like it's like you know you can't you can't protect everything you can't have high security everywhere 

411.96 412.52 A: (( [mn] )) 

413.40 414.31 A: yeah 

420.59 421.55 B: so 

420.86 423.49 A: that's true impossible it costs too much 

423.33 425.03 B: you know i think i mean 

425.49 428.92 B: i don't know i think with the whole what do you think of the war in iraq 

429.27 432.28 A: what do i think about it i think it's good i 

431.09 432.48 B: yeah you think you 

432.42 434.25 A: i think it i think it's good we've got 

432.79 434.05 B: (( think it what )) 

434.41 437.51 A: i think it's good we've got uh got rid of saddam and 

438.20 441.57 A: we're getting things going there a little democracy 

438.25 440.04 B: (( yeah )) 

440.07 441.08 B: yeah 

442.11 452.77 B: and i think we give what we i mean i think we went there thinking that there's no way we're gonna i mean originally we went there to um disarm anybody from world um [lipsmack] 

442.55 443.70 A: (( and we need to )) 

453.09 466.02 B: weapons of mass destruction right but there's no way you're gonna be able to take those away because they knew they uh you know get the feeling they just got rid of those weapons right away to other countries but i think it's good that we got rid of saddam because he's a fucking 

455.08 455.90 A: yeah 

466.42 468.35 B: and 

466.92 468.95 A: saddam was crazy 

468.36 475.88 B: he was he was really crazy but now now it's left on our on our hands that to rebuild that country which is gonna cost us a lot of money you know 

474.87 476.72 A: (( mm yeah )) 

476.12 479.33 B: so now it's more of more of a human relation 

479.45 482.25 B: um ordeal than it was a uh 

482.44 489.43 B: of uh mass destruction because the people who have the weapons they still have 'em they just removed them you know 

484.41 486.71 A: (( mm )) 

489.35 490.21 A: (( yep )) 

489.73 497.70 B: so it's it's annoying but what are ya going to you've gotta set some kind of example and say like we'll take down anybody we you know we have to because the saddam was 

497.69 510.18 B: one of the most influential terrorists i think in in the world and we we we shit out iraq you know in like two weeks we we took a whole country over so we've got to set an example so 

507.36 508.05 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

509.98 512.30 A: yeah i think the example's just gonna 

512.34 517.46 A: make us look stronger and and terrorists will know that we're not we're not messing around we're gonna 

516.04 526.35 B: yeah yeah yeah yep yep yep well
