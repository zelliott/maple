12.14 13.42 B: (( what do you think )) 

13.36 27.12 A: well they were we're both pretty close i guess to the to the ah world trade tower so we were close enough to somewhat feel it or know you know it's not like i was in california or something you know it was 

27.24 30.60 A: an hour away or at least for me i don't know about you 

30.23 31.15 B: uh-huh 

30.92 32.98 A: you how far are you from it 

32.63 35.80 B: i think we're about four hours away from the city mhm 

35.03 39.26 A: ah you're four all right so you're further than that but i mean i think it's 

39.32 49.87 A: you feel a little bit differently when it's that close or when you've you know i don't know if you ah saw it lately they just had one at yale newhaven the other day 

49.55 50.63 B: yeah 

50.01 52.58 A: a bombing and again you know that's 

52.95 60.16 A: twenty minutes from here and ah i don't know i f- i tend to feel somewhat safe because 

60.29 67.85 A: i don't think there is ah you know if they're going to go after things they're going to go after the either the ah high 

68.43 69.80 A: you know ah 

69.97 76.10 A: profile places in new york city or a school like yale or 

76.34 80.71 A: or a major bridge or a or some- you know the 

80.80 82.52 A: bridge or something 

82.55 96.13 A: you know i i think i'm somewhat safe in my town but you still don't want to see it happen anywhere but ah and i and i i don't think i travel or my family travels to the likelihood pl- places ah 

96.45 101.45 A: you know it seems like the whatever their their intentions are it's ah 

101.91 107.77 A: you know always been something that ah there's a lot of people at a mall or something like that but 

107.59 108.59 B: right 

108.51 120.39 A: i don't know i i i somewhat feel safe where i live and in in in my usual travels but ah you know you have to feel for anybody who has to go through it though 

120.32 130.50 B: yeah absolutely i mean just seeing what they were going through and the panic that ah initially anyway you know when they first heard the boom and didn't know what was going on 

130.41 138.80 B: that in itself can cause a little bit of stress well a lot of stress but you know after that though i think most people 

139.03 147.75 B: resigned themselves for understanding okay well whatever's going to happen next is going to happen next and there's not much more we can do about it other than try and be safe 

147.45 148.33 A: true 

147.85 157.37 B: you know like the a- there's never even like flee to alaska or anything and and i- if you do you know everybody running to alaska i don't see that happening 

157.40 159.16 B: or canada you know 

158.34 166.75 A: mm no no i don't either i can see you know again if something happened of that magnitude in new york where people really start 

166.63 175.37 A: considering of working in new york and and and the subway systems and all that i could see ah if it happens again of that 

175.33 185.31 A: you know size and some you know i could see people starting to wondering if it's worth commuting into the city for the high bucks and everything else 

184.86 186.17 B: yeah that's true 

185.95 195.41 A: ah but i again you know where i live or whatever i feel s- you know you always think about it it's always i i find myself ah 

186.91 187.81 B: (( it's true mhm )) 

196.47 201.94 A: in the car listening on the radio that is today the day you're going to hear something or 

202.45 203.93 A: you know ah 

204.04 208.89 A: but i think like you know they all say it you've just got to go on with life you can't start 

208.98 213.94 A: looking over your shoulder every ten minutes at who's behind you in the shopping lane and ah 

213.57 214.72 B: yeah 

214.26 225.20 A: yeah you have to be ah cognizant of it but i mean ah we all see our fare share of wackos as it hits [laughter] let alone ah wondering if they're a terrorist or something 

221.48 222.56 B: sure 

225.04 236.06 B: that's true too like we we do have a lot of devious activity that goes on in our day to day lives as it is and there's no reason to be paranoid and freaked out and not leave your home or anything 

235.92 243.41 B: you know that of course you have to be safe and cautious but i think the general public is has enough commonsense to you know 

243.72 254.33 B: carry on with caution but not freak out um of course there will be some that will freak out and that you know [laughter] that can be accounted for as well 

254.36 264.46 B: but i don't know on a related note like um the sniper that was going through d._c. my parents live ah really close to i ninety five and for a while 

264.53 273.48 B: you know it was pretty calm watching and of course i was worried for everybody and their families but the closer they got to where my parents live i think the closer 

273.27 280.36 B: you know i started feeling to it and monitoring it a lot but once again i didn't feel the panic i just felt fear for them 

275.13 276.01 A: yeah 

280.43 283.34 A: yeah and and and how do you ah 

283.66 299.37 A: you know unless you really know somebody it it's it's hard to relate it's not hard but you don't relate to it and until you've actually gone through it and you know somebody a street over got killed or a sniper or whatever and we're in the same town 

299.84 301.15 A: (( but ah )) 

301.25 308.39 A: you know you like you said you just until it hits home it it you know i don't know what i would do i i think i would if 

308.45 313.78 A: a bomb went off wherever i was i think i would y- you got to expect there to be 

313.76 327.73 A: mass panic and ah people fleeing and just running and pushing and and just getting out of there and not knowing what was going on and there's no reason to to find out what's going on just get out of there 

327.16 328.49 B: (( mhm right )) 

327.82 332.48 A: and i y- you know th- the panic you know you can tell everybody to be calm but 

332.88 336.90 A: you know unless you're actually there i don't know how you would handle it 

336.29 337.92 B: you're right yeah 

336.98 341.21 A: and then you know at at the the world trade center my god you know the 

341.35 348.91 A: to stand there and see a building coming down like that was horrifying on just seeing it on t._v. and if if you were looking up at it 

349.02 354.60 A: if you were there my you know i c- i don't know if i'd ever want to work in new york again after that 

354.06 358.91 B: yeah you would seriously think about moving somewhere where it was slightly more safe 

358.70 364.03 A: yeah and ah you know those people all had great jobs and everything else but 

364.07 368.03 A: you know now in retrospect is it worth it or was it worth it 

367.65 376.89 B: [laughter] they also said like at at one point after the world trade center happened they they were talking about terrorist plotting to get the heartland of america 

376.87 386.98 B: and i know that like being being in central pennsylvania this is close to the heartland and you know at that time when i heard that i i was considering 

386.88 398.50 B: you know where would you go then you know if they're going to get the heartland they're going to get the major cities or whoever is going to do anything i mean w- w- you can't spend your whole time running but 

398.77 400.39 B: yeah i guess it just 

399.44 403.67 A: yeah i mean yeah it's but you know are they going to go into the heartland you know 

403.56 414.88 A: what are they going to go into ah you know they're not going to come in i don't think into an individual house and blow up a house with three people they you know all that they keep telling you is that they're into 

409.15 410.07 B: right 

414.93 423.75 A: massive destruction and cause as many fatalities as they can and ah you know again malls or 

424.54 426.87 A: you know it seems like everytime they 

427.29 435.91 A: add extra security it's malls it's bridges it's it's ah you know massive people around that they go after 

435.63 436.57 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

435.97 441.91 A: ah you know and and but like you said if it's the heartland and you know w- what are they talking about they 

441.93 447.45 A: they're going to go after the agriculture they're going to go after you know some big water plant or 

447.83 448.85 A: (( ah )) 

449.11 453.62 A: i don't know you know i i just think you've got to go on every day and ah 

454.07 467.60 A: if it was yours if it's your day to go it's your day to go and maybe you can ah not help 'em along but if you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time ah if it's just meant to be it's meant to be 

468.14 470.31 A: i'd hate to see it happen but 

470.45 475.18 A: i think we all know that something's going to happen again eventually it's not going to be 

475.35 477.35 A: this is the end of it 

476.80 479.12 B: ah what do you think would be 

479.19 493.18 B: you know something that can help deter that is other than heightened security 'cause that in itself i mean that yes of course we need it but eventually we're all going to be locked down under tightened security everywhere we go i mean 

492.97 493.93 A: yeah 

493.38 499.41 B: you know i find that we also don't under i'm from a different culture and i find that like in general 

499.32 508.99 B: you know we don't really understand other cultures quite as well to you know communicate with them effectively you know a lot of the things that do go on between countries 

509.18 511.57 B: i don't know the diplomats [laughter] are 

511.70 514.55 B: doing it the right way of course those are my own 

514.49 527.23 B: you know thoughts on the matter as i think that sometimes if you pay a little bit more attention on how their country is run or their ideas are then maybe you might have a better way of communicating with people but 

527.40 530.70 B: and then again i'm still kind of young and don't know [laughter] everything 

530.24 537.14 A: yeah i agree somewhat there but i i also believe in ah this over the years they never tell us the full truth 

530.72 531.50 B: so 

536.93 537.78 B: (( mhm right )) 

537.19 550.47 A: they never tell us everything that you know we need to what we probably should know and they claim they're not telling us for our own good or there'd be mass hysteria if they let out some of the stuff they 

550.42 558.60 A: they do know and not that they knew that the world trade center was coming but ah you know i think 

558.58 570.14 A: they know a little bit more of what's going on than they tell us and i i don't trust politicians as far as you can throw 'em and they're only out to save themselves and of course when the 

570.15 574.46 A: they're all there when the cameras are on saying all the right things but 

574.64 581.85 A: you know every time you pick up the ah you know the the paper or turn on the news it's another scandal or there's another 

582.00 592.06 A: who's doing this or who's doing that and ah you know it was somebody you thought was telling the truth or a square guy is playing games themself 

592.35 599.89 A: so who do you trust and who do you listen to and you know like you said it it it you know this heightened alert data
