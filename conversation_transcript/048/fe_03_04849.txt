179.04 187.96 B: ah 'cause you just didn't know where when what and i don't know about you but i still think that something else is going to happen it's just a matter of when and where 

185.74 186.66 A: ah 

186.87 201.87 A: i'm not sure i think things were happening in in other parts of the coun- i mean other parts of the world and we don't know if it's related but i mean [noise] since since it's happened new york city has been on orange alert and i really i mean

215.30 218.32 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

217.71 227.12 B: 'cause they still you know you nobody everybody thought anything like that would ever happen here we just get a little complacent because of our freedoms and stuff we just don't think like that we don't live like that and we don't want to 

223.47 225.56 A: (( yeah )) 

225.74 226.88 A: [noise] 

227.19 234.52 A: oh we're americans and we're like the the country that's ruling the rest of the world 

234.52 239.74 B: so it would seem yeah in a way it would seem that way but even though that's not our intent 

234.60 235.68 A: in a way 

238.00 240.87 A: (( but )) 

239.93 244.49 B: it's like we'd like to help everybody see things that there there's another way 

244.72 245.46 A: (( mm )) 

245.64 247.80 B: but yeah i i think that ah 

247.94 254.28 B: there are people out there i know people myself that have you know like stock piled things just in case 

253.69 255.26 A: (( [laughter] okay )) 

254.49 259.62 B: and stuff like that you know 'cause you just don't know when you don't where you don't know what 

259.34 272.88 A: yeah i mean i keep like a reserve of cash and [noise] like a flash light and some water but i haven't like gone to extremes like some people have gas masks at home and all this other stuff but that's 

266.12 267.32 B: yeah 

270.13 271.69 B: oh yeah 

271.78 284.44 B: yeah i don't know any that have gone to that extreme to save you know stock piled stuff but i think it's probably a good idea to have a little bit of stuff just on hand just to like they say just in case like if you have a storm or something and your electric's out for a few days 

283.46 285.59 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

284.75 292.04 B: that kind of stuff but do you think people what would people do what do you think do you think they'd run off or try to run off where would they run 

293.81 296.66 A: [noise] hi hold hold on for one second 

295.61 296.69 B: okay 

296.86 297.76 A: hi 

298.77 303.39 A: i want to fly i i'll be right back no what were you saying 

301.65 304.87 B: w- are you way are you on your way home from work or 

304.87 314.43 A: no actually i work early in the mornings 'cause i work i actually work for u._p._s. so i was there when it happened and it was like i could see it from my job 

306.83 307.86 B: oh 

309.34 310.81 B: oh 

313.96 315.81 B: oh my gosh 

314.59 318.35 A: and i was b- but my biggest concern was that i was going to get 

318.14 330.64 A: stuck in manhattan 'cause i live in brooklyn and like when it happened they cut the subway system off so i don't know if you've seen the photos on the news of people like walking across the brooklyn bridge to get home 

320.46 321.91 B: mhm 

323.91 325.63 B: mhm 

326.15 327.57 B: mhm 

328.54 329.79 B: oh yeah 

329.87 336.64 B: oh yeah you know that's something that really amazed me and i point that out to people you see how fast everything got shut down 

336.55 338.16 A: yeah well ah 

337.02 348.37 B: you wouldn't think this big of a place could get shut down that fast i happened to be home that day from work myself and i just got out of the shower and my [laughter] girlfriend called me she said were you trying to take over without me 

348.24 360.46 B: i'm like what are you talking about so i turned on the t._v. 'cause i was watching my granddaughter and i was just like i could not believe it just one thing right after the other and nobody knew exactly what was going on and it's just like oh my god 

348.27 349.51 A: [laughter] 

355.71 356.51 A: oh 

359.50 369.48 A: yeah it's like i'm so used to knowing what's going on and the entire like i i read like th- three different newspapers a day and like i like to 

366.91 375.59 B: mhm oh yeah i like to keep up on stuff too just like you said to know what's going on when you don't know what's going on it's like holy crap [laughter] 

374.96 386.28 A: like every day i will wake up and the only channel that will work would be channel two and they just have would have it focused on ground zero and i'm like well when is everything going to go back to normal 

383.68 385.39 B: yeah do you think that was 

385.70 388.77 B: yeah do you think that was a little bit overload after a while there 

387.91 392.90 A: yeah it was but it's like they ha- they they couldn't show anything else on t._v. 

392.29 406.97 B: no huh-uh well people were hungry for the information 'cause you just really didn't know what was going on and i think once you had enough information to know what was actually happening and why well as much as we could figure out why and what was going on for there i think people had about enough of it then 

407.43 411.94 B: you know it's okay to have updates and stuff but my gosh it was so saturated 

411.61 413.43 A: yeah 

412.32 423.36 B: you couldn't go anywhere do anything everybody's constantly with their radios and the t._v. and stuff like that and it's like oh my gosh and a lot of people were absolutely paralysed they couldn't go out of their home 

423.84 428.93 A: yeah some people were sh- i know i know that for a fact that some people were shell shocked 

426.93 427.96 B: mhm 

428.19 430.83 B: yeah i'm i do social work 

430.67 432.07 A: oh social work 

430.99 436.88 B: i'm in that line yeah and ah we couldn't get people to come into the office for their interviews i'm a case worker 

432.53 433.27 A: (( okay )) 

436.64 437.65 A: (( oh okay )) 

436.65 451.28 B: for the our our welfare department we couldn't get people to come out of their homes and into the office for their interviews because they were scared something was going to happen because they shut our building down 'cause well even though we're a county office we're still a state department and they shut down all the state offices that day 

443.19 444.88 A: (( [noise] )) 

451.50 455.26 B: but they were just absolutely panicked it's like oh my god something's going to happen there 

454.61 457.91 A: mhm wow 

456.83 466.40 B: but it's it's just not going to happen well you don't know that and that's to me that's a distinct possibility because you know you hit something big why not hit some little places too mhm 

466.05 479.62 A: n- no but and see in my opinion it's like the little places are safe it's like i i i worry about the major cities i worry about new york city washington d._c. los angeles i mean places like that i don't know but i mean i 

472.81 473.84 B: yeah 

476.10 477.11 B: yeah 

477.89 487.18 B: yeah i do too and that's my boyfriend's still he's la- up in cleveland and i go up there every weekend and you know it just it makes me nervous [laughter] 

486.61 494.53 A: mean sometimes i think it might be safer just to move like maybe like somewhere like in the mid west or something 

494.18 507.89 B: well you would be surprised probably about a lot of stuff going on up there that you don't know about you think wide open spaces just not close to anything of major importance that well we live ah three mile island is like a- i don't know thirty forty miles away 

505.73 506.49 A: [noise] 

509.69 510.58 A: oh 

509.74 513.77 B: so you know you're never really too far away from something major 

513.99 514.89 A: huh 

515.14 521.90 A: but in your opinion do you think everything has gone gone back to normal as far as like people's pep- yeah 

520.92 528.72 B: yes because they've gotten to the point where they're so used to the alerts going up and down and up and down and not seeing any result what do you think 

526.04 526.80 A: (( pep- )) 

528.76 536.31 A: yeah i i i think everything it took a while but after like the year past things have gone back to normal a little bit 

531.52 532.54 B: mhm 

533.90 535.05 B: settled down 

535.72 536.89 B: yeah 

536.29 547.13 A: and it's like like i've even known to like yesterday when i was watching the news that new york city has been on orange alert since september eleven and and i think i in 

547.02 552.71 A: my opinion everything went back to normal except that like in certain parts of the city and in the weekends 

552.93 556.52 A: like you have more of a police presence on the subway 

556.72 562.47 A: and it's like they just pop out up out of nowhere and i can cer- 

562.65 571.16 A: i don't know if you know where time square is but that time square is like the shopping district and the theatre district and you have like police 

564.54 565.50 B: uh-huh 

571.31 579.57 A: everywhere with emergency service units with like automatic weapons right on the street with bullet proof vests and everything and 

578.96 583.97 B: we have seen pictures of that going on you know across national news and stuff like that too 

584.06 593.47 B: and it's it's just isn't that kind of like disarming or just shelving you you know kind of make you nervous or just does it snap you back into awareness do you think or 

591.59 599.89 A: no actually actually it makes me feel safer it's like if i didn't it it puts you at a it gives you peace of mind in a way
