102.29 106.40 B: me me either as long as there's people there'll be terrorism

111.87 112.88 B: yeah 

112.33 124.85 A: you'll cut it down but you'll never completely stop it and i just don't think that that there's any way to completely stop it because it's just become a way a way of life with with some people 

114.34 116.54 B: (( never stop no )) 

124.63 126.16 B: yeah

157.26 166.46 B: (( every time you looking at the news something about terrorism it's like they trying like i let him go on the computer most of the time 'cause he's looking at so much t._v. about the terrorism )) 

166.42 170.01 A: yeah yeah i think that's that's the thing i don't think 

167.10 167.99 B: and 

170.18 178.79 A: people if something happens it'd be harder for people to keep very calm because they've been expecting it you know 

178.88 180.27 A: so much 

179.78 181.23 B: yeah 

180.84 182.37 A: (( how do you ah )) 

182.41 188.28 A: how do you feel about how bush has been handling terrorism

197.82 199.81 A: do you do you like bush 

200.01 202.89 B: (( no i'm not a fan person i don't really like him )) 

202.96 209.81 A: yeah i i just think that to me i think that that bush you know i i mean 

210.17 214.22 A: to me the only thing that you could do about terrorism is try to 

214.38 219.40 A: is try to keep a country calm and and try to 

218.75 220.43 B: and informed [mn] 

219.81 223.44 A: yeah and try to keep a lot of communication with 

223.33 236.87 A: with different countries where terrorism comes from but when you start attacking places and and bombing them the the trouble is it just gives people over there more reason 

236.57 239.05 B: to retaliate the airplane yeah 

237.58 251.36 A: to retaliate exactly i mean now it's like you know the the they say that you know there's there's kids over there that you know after they've been bombed by the u._s. you know 

251.43 257.70 A: they figure once they grow up they'll become a terrorist and get back to them get back at them 

256.44 259.26 B: yeah get at yeah 

258.31 267.61 A: so i i just don't i just don't think it's really the way to handle it you know you you might have to use force at times but in general i think 

267.63 273.01 A: you have to co- try to communicate more with other countries and 

272.05 275.31 B: yeah and understand that ah culture too more 

275.31 284.34 A: right exactly yeah i mean it's different different peoples different places and you know and on top of it i mean we have 

280.64 281.97 B: yeah
