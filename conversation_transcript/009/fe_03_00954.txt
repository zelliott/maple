155.98 157.89 B: moved in with a significant other 

158.20 158.73 A: mhm 

158.31 158.72 B: so 

158.87 162.47 B: kind of scary but i'm in no way thinking about marriage like i kind of just 

163.15 164.91 B: like i don't know 

164.51 165.68 A: it's comfortable right now 

166.06 168.99 B: yeah yeah you know i'm comfortable where i am right now and 

176.02 176.49 A: mhm 

176.19 176.88 B: and it was like 

177.01 181.71 B: i saw people my age and i saw them getting into relationships like serious relationships 

182.21 183.75 B: and all they you know 

184.18 184.74 B: i don't know 

184.93 191.11 B: like they just got it they just jumped into them you know because it was what to do and it's not like they really only wanted to be with that person they just 

191.49 196.02 B: were only with that person because that's what they were supposed to do because they were boyfriend and girlfriend you know 

196.29 196.73 A: mhm 

196.31 204.66 B: and when really i just thought i was in a point in my life to where it was like i'm not going to fake somebody out and i'm not going to lie to myself if i want to be with other people like i'm not going to stay with one person 

205.25 206.40 B: you know so that's what i did 

206.84 207.32 A: mhm 

207.04 209.43 B: i just shopped around and i hung out with other people and then 

209.70 213.17 B: you know when i came to the point where i didn't i truly like 

213.53 215.53 B: didn't want to be with anybody else 

215.78 216.84 B: that's when you know 

217.43 221.15 B: i i guess i considered myself monogam- in a monogamous relationship 

221.80 222.21 B: so 

221.81 222.29 A: mhm 

222.31 222.92 B: i don't know 

223.63 228.88 B: uh i just don't know about life partners i'm too flighty and fickle 

228.55 228.97 A: mhm 

229.04 231.15 B: yeah it's it's crazy i i mean i don't know 

231.96 233.08 A: are you a student right now 

232.00 232.39 B: no 

233.12 234.47 B: yeah i'm a student at georgia state 

235.32 236.77 A: oh okay what field are you studying 

237.01 239.11 B: i'm studying geology actually 

239.73 240.25 A: okay 

239.79 242.54 B: and i'm really excited i finally i've changed my major like 

242.74 243.77 B: four different times 

243.91 244.48 A: really 

244.21 246.14 B: so yeah 

245.22 246.11 A: you changed from what 

246.29 251.55 B: uh i went from a computer science major actually i was going to southern polytech in mariana 

252.07 256.40 B: and then i changed to i went to ge- started going to georgia state and became a psychology major 

256.68 263.72 B: and then i became a sociology major and now i'm a geology major and i think i've got to stick to it otherwise i'll i'm already a year behind 

263.93 268.95 B: like i'm supposed to graduate next year but it'll take me another two years to do so if i stay on track but 

269.64 270.22 B: i don't know 

271.58 272.97 B: hopefully this is something i like 

273.84 278.03 B: or will stick to will keep liking like i guess i liked everything else at the time 

278.24 278.81 A: mhm 

278.87 279.90 B: so what do you do 

280.86 281.74 A: i'm a social worker 

282.19 285.86 B: are you no kidding yeah that's what i wanted to do when i was in sociology 

286.15 286.73 A: mhm 

286.55 289.32 B: that's really ya- but you know the reason i got out of it 

289.58 292.88 B: and i'd go i went into science is that i needed something tangible 

293.06 295.71 B: like sociology is just filled with biases and i was almost 

295.96 297.21 B: too weak of a person 

297.74 298.36 A: mhm 

304.74 306.07 B: fix every thing's so hard 

306.29 310.36 B: so i guess i took the wrong road just being like you know forget it then i just can't handle it you know 

310.69 314.40 B: but still i just wanted to save the world and it was just so unattainable you know 

314.64 317.50 A: yeah you wanted something more tangible you know like a hard science 

317.37 320.69 B: like a rock yeah so 

318.92 319.51 A: yeah 

320.81 326.64 B: just because i don't know it just hurts that you know just think about like all it you know it's just such a class war 

328.27 329.43 B: like i don't know 

330.22 340.69 B: as much as it could be like broken out into like a race war kind of a thing you know all the prejudices again- ra- against races and stuff like i'm so all about equality and like it's just really a class thing 

336.59 337.07 A: mhm 

341.27 342.81 B: you know i mean but you know that you know 

342.95 343.48 A: right 

344.31 350.84 B: like i was just talking to my friend the other day it sucks like right before mar- uh reve- the you know the reverend martin luther king was about to um 

351.69 355.35 B: uh well right before he got assassinated he was supposed to do like a 

355.85 357.81 B: a big march on washington with just 

358.06 358.50 B: you know 

358.89 359.68 B: poor people 

360.10 362.36 B: like not you know black people white people just 

362.55 363.33 B: poor people 

363.58 364.67 B: because that's you know that's 

364.60 365.05 A: mhm 

365.40 367.61 B: where everything you know everything sucked really 

369.12 373.60 A: well that's dangerous when you do something like that when you unite the races and stuff like that the classes 

373.73 374.32 B: yeah 

375.08 375.78 B: i guess so 

375.73 377.38 A: that's a dangerous position to be in 

378.01 379.47 A: because nobody wants that to happen 

381.37 383.12 B: there just has to be equality you know 

383.30 383.88 A: mhm 

383.63 385.49 B: like it's not fair it's not fair that the 

385.79 389.26 B: one percent of the top is getting ninety five percent of the resources 

389.60 390.21 A: mhm 

390.61 391.17 B: i don't know 

390.69 393.95 A: well that's good to begin with when you're when you're in geology is resources 

393.96 395.12 B: yeah exactly 

395.26 398.47 A: basically like all rocks and stuff like that and the you know 

398.88 400.33 B: yeah those are resources but 

400.26 406.55 A: a lot of opportunities that you know well i know i had a friend who uh went into geology and i said where in the world do you work and she ended up working for exxon 

406.87 407.44 B: mhm 

407.90 408.86 B: yeah i hear that happens 

409.50 416.48 B: like uh where you could test ground water or you could test like you know i could actually a friend of mine's sister was a geologist 

416.92 419.41 B: and um no a friend of mine's 

420.04 421.14 B: why did i just make that up 

421.49 422.14 B: friend of mine 

422.48 426.90 B: ex-girlfriend's brother was a geologist and actually turned into an f._b._i. agent 

427.18 429.99 B: because he would like check whether corporations were um 

430.76 431.35 B: you know 

431.97 432.69 B: polluting 

432.87 440.79 B: or something you know i just thought that was interesting that's what i'm going to do i'm not going to save the people of the world but i'm going to save the world i'm going to be an environmentalist 

433.07 433.53 A: mhm 

438.98 439.50 A: mhm 

441.42 443.90 B: yet i still throw my cigarette butts out the window you know 

443.70 444.21 A: mhm 

444.08 451.06 B: i'm bad we all have our vices but there's another study i saw on (( creative listings )) where you get three hundred and twenty five dollars for um 

452.54 453.02 A: what the s- 

452.54 453.87 B: quitting sm- quitting smoking 

454.12 454.83 A: smoke study 

454.99 457.26 B: yeah so i was thinking about doing that but eh 

459.42 460.44 B: anyway 

460.32 461.54 A: yeah that one's very nice 

462.37 462.82 B: yeah 

464.20 465.71 A: i got turned down for that 

465.72 467.54 B: rea- the uh smoke study 

467.80 469.32 A: yeah because i came out of a 

469.87 472.61 A: uh i was (( )) for alcoholism 

472.47 472.86 B: uh-huh 

473.55 477.28 A: and that disqualified me eh because it was less than in the three month period 

477.27 477.94 B: oh wow 

478.79 479.78 B: that's interesting 

479.85 480.35 A: mhm 

482.86 484.11 A: yes you may want to check it out 

484.25 485.40 B: yeah i'm doing a 

485.62 486.13 B: anthrax 

486.22 488.44 B: vaccine research study at emory right now 

488.80 490.57 B: i'm getting paid fifty dollars a visit 

490.96 491.55 A: mhm 

491.21 492.74 B: and i get uh there's like 

492.92 495.14 B: twenty five total visits in three and a half years 

495.36 495.88 A: right 

495.58 498.18 B: and i haven't had any reactions to the vaccine so 

498.82 501.85 B: either i'm in the salt water group you know the um 

502.95 503.78 A: how is that 

503.92 505.27 A: because i'm supposed to go thursday 

503.95 504.39 B: huh 

505.43 506.78 B: oh are you going thursday 

506.83 507.37 A: uh-huh 

507.01 516.56 B: oh it's fine it's it's great like uh nothing you just keep a diary you know and you hold you know you take your temperature the first four days of your vaccine are you getting your first vaccine on thursday 

516.67 517.18 A: uh-huh 

517.38 520.73 B: yeah i got my first vaccine two weeks ago last thursday 

521.02 522.87 B: and i didn't have any reaction at all 

523.24 526.53 B: so either i just don't have a reaction or i'm in the placebo group but 

527.80 528.49 B: either way 

527.87 528.86 A: are you supposed to 

529.31 533.06 B: well it says in the did you read the pamphlet it said like you might get uh like just 

532.77 534.02 A: oh yeah like side effects 

534.11 538.45 B: yeah local side effects though just at the area of the shot which is like a i think they said 

538.91 541.42 B: maybe redness swelling itching 

541.60 542.98 B: i didn't have anything 

541.69 542.20 A: mhm 

543.09 543.51 B: so 

544.36 545.85 B: and even you know if so it 

546.15 551.42 B: still you get paid fifty bucks you know to do nothing to be a guinea pig that's interesting that you're doing that 

551.70 553.08 A: mhm and they pay you right then 

553.24 558.27 B: uh no actually it's four pay periods you have to go i think it's eight visits in the first two months 

558.37 559.16 B: and then they pay you 

559.38 562.57 B: it's seven or eight visits uh i don- i don't know what's the math on that seven visits 

562.95 563.43 A: mhm 

563.04 564.14 B: and you get three hundred and 

564.30 565.47 B: uh fifty dollars 

565.74 568.15 B: you get a three hundred and fifty dollar check on your seventh visit 

568.49 571.16 B: and then you go back six months later and do a few more visit-
