59.81 63.27 B: why do people why are they so popular well 

65.40 69.60 B: i think first of all they're probably not that popular it's just that we don't 

70.18 73.89 B: have much of a choice you know that's all they're putting on right now 

73.64 76.00 A: that's the truth that's all that's on anymore 

76.07 80.10 B: survivor was a big hit so they just copied it to death i think 

80.76 82.86 A: and i think people are tired of all the reality 

83.22 83.70 B: yeah 

83.62 85.19 A: shows now i don't think that there 

85.67 87.37 A: there's a new one called the family 

88.20 88.51 A: that 

88.26 90.13 B: now that that looks kind of interesting 

90.75 91.90 A: uh now i didn't watch it i heard 

90.81 92.36 B: or else i'll be tempted 

92.63 93.30 A: did you watch it 

93.62 95.28 B: no is it already started 

95.51 97.86 A: um they said it was on um last night 

98.18 99.17 B: oh i missed it 

99.91 102.42 A: and uh they said it was about some italian family 

102.63 103.07 B: uh-huh 

103.55 105.39 A: but i figured it was just one more 

106.41 109.31 A: reality show that i didn't want to watch 

109.30 111.25 B: well i tell you i'm in kentucky 

111.41 119.69 B: and we're having a terrible time right now with c._b._s. wanting to run this uh hillbilly thing taking a appalachian family 

120.23 123.38 B: a poor family and putting them in beverly hills 

123.60 124.19 A: huh 

124.61 126.64 A: oh no see i don't think that's right 

131.07 136.38 B: you know the appalachian regional people are trying to work with c._b._s. to get them to not do such a 

136.66 139.40 B: crude thing so 

138.72 139.28 A: and not 

139.56 142.94 A: i mean that would just be on to watch somebody else's pain 

143.60 147.45 B: exactly i mean it would be like putting a c._b._s. executive 

147.88 153.32 B: up here in the mountains of kentucky you know with no cell phone no car 

152.54 153.50 A: no computer 

153.80 157.69 B: no computer no staff you know hello 

157.88 160.24 B: it would be painful for everybody 

160.68 162.78 B: now the family 

162.95 165.11 B: i mean that's just playing on greed 

165.40 168.54 B: i mean that's the way i understand it the family is trying to 

168.66 172.82 B: out do each other to get a million dollars and they don't know it but the staff is 

173.18 174.03 B: judging them 

174.09 175.32 A: they're laughing at them 

175.38 179.01 B: yeah i guess we all are if we're watching it 

177.06 177.62 A: you know 

179.51 181.61 A: the um now the mole uh not the 

182.18 184.80 A: the mole was and the survivor 

185.48 188.73 A: i watched because of the different contests in the survivor 

188.96 189.40 B: yeah 

189.27 190.41 A: you know the different 

190.71 191.19 A: um 

191.79 194.01 A: contests they had to see who could out do 

194.88 195.78 A: somebody else 

196.44 196.91 B: yeah 

196.97 197.22 A: but 

197.34 199.20 A: uh like the fear factor i don't watch that 

199.39 201.08 B: nah i (( say )) i can't do that 

201.75 203.26 B: nah that's just too much for me 

203.36 203.72 A: yeah 

203.37 208.61 B: even on survivor eating worms that's a little unnecessary i think 

208.41 212.79 A: and it's just to see how gross so- how what would somebody stoop to 

212.91 213.50 B: mhm 

213.35 214.36 A: to get a million dollars 

216.83 219.94 A: and big brother is just watching people bicker that's all that was 

220.74 221.89 B: now wait a minute big brother 

222.04 224.31 B: that's where everybody was living in the house 

224.38 224.85 A: yeah 

224.95 227.42 B: okay yeah i did watch a little bit of that 

227.98 231.84 B: yeah and that's all they did was fuss and talk about each other behind their backs 

232.20 233.73 A: yeah how s- and that's just wha- 

233.07 234.52 B: i can get that at work 

234.64 235.62 B: you know 

235.47 238.60 A: that's just to watch to see how sneaky one can be 

238.67 239.32 B: mhm 

240.02 242.24 A: and i thought that was i watched that one season 

242.66 243.22 B: yeah 

243.07 244.00 A: then i'd had enough 

245.90 248.57 A: but they're over doing it with uh who wants to marry 

249.21 252.01 A: they want you to vote on somebody to ma- uh marry 

252.76 254.09 A: two people that don't know each other 

254.36 254.80 B: yeah 

255.18 257.03 B: now i thought about that for awhile and then 

258.42 263.41 B: i heard some people say you know people have been arranging marriages for centuries and i thought well 

264.28 267.61 B: could that be any worse than having a marriage arranged you know 

268.38 270.02 B: having it arranged by a 

271.29 271.93 B: audience 

272.91 274.14 A: oh i hadn't thought about it like that 

274.86 275.37 B: so 

275.67 278.80 B: you know and if they don't want to marry they don't have to like uh 

280.06 281.20 B: oh what was that 

281.42 282.32 B: first one 

283.08 285.54 B: who wants to marry not the millionaire but the 

285.18 286.14 A: the bachelor 

286.12 288.94 B: dar- yeah uh darma darva whatev- 

288.44 290.61 A: darva conger or conga whatever

296.55 299.36 A: didn't turn out any we- uh uh very well and he's from t- uh 

299.97 300.65 A: turin missouri 

301.16 302.57 B: of you're in missouri okay

305.10 306.05 A: no i don't know him 

306.16 306.69 A: he's a 

306.80 307.57 A: a banker 

307.67 309.00 A: i know people who work for him 

309.07 309.73 B: uh-huh 

309.97 314.95 A: and they said he was real fickle and when they saw him on t._v. they laughed because that is nothing like him 

315.71 319.08 B: oh god wait you know i heard the same thing about zora on uh 

319.71 320.67 B: joe millionaire 

321.49 322.00 B: the real 

322.54 329.14 B: sex pot yeah and she was just playing hard to get to to win the game which she did you know course 

322.76 323.84 A: oh is that right 

329.36 332.96 B: i don't know if i'd do any better or not if i was on one of those shows 

333.56 337.32 B: i'd have to be an entirely different person to get on one of those shows though 

337.70 340.65 A: oh see i thought well i'd like to go do like the mole 

341.15 341.69 B: uh-huh 

342.14 343.26 A: uh where you know 

343.41 345.35 A: you're trying to win all that money but you're 

345.66 347.09 A: um doing different things 

347.58 352.18 A: and i thought okay that's too physical for me maybe i'll go do the big brother 

352.59 354.11 A: because you don't do anything in there 

354.29 360.82 B: well now that's a thought just sit around and play cards or something lay around the the pool 

357.67 358.03 A: yeah 

361.30 362.15 A: i could do that 

362.23 362.73 B: yeah 

362.57 363.63 A: and but then 

364.51 366.71 A: you know i'm not sure that i would um 

367.26 369.05 A: be able to play their mind games 

369.22 370.46 B: no i couldn't 

371.02 371.71 B: couldn't do it 

371.79 375.17 B: you know that whole thing is so unreal anyway 

375.78 376.93 A: -ell they edited out 

377.66 378.07 A: uh 

378.34 379.06 A: i hear they edit 

379.18 380.36 A: out so much of it 

380.89 382.41 A: to slant someone's 

383.00 384.54 A: to look like they want them to 

384.83 385.85 B: exactly 

386.09 390.47 A: so what we're seeing on t._v. isn't even half of what went on and that's not even half 

386.19 386.81 B: exactly 

390.59 391.33 A: personality 

391.48 393.04 B: exactly you can't 

393.33 395.74 B: i wouldn't trust the uh the network at all 

397.69 398.56 A: yeah i work for um 

398.88 401.83 A: when i lived in los angeles for a._b._c. for a short time 

402.96 408.25 A: and just the people who were in there trying to come up and i mean i mea- i was a lackey i was a nothing 

409.75 410.24 A: thank you son 

410.56 413.93 A: uh i was a nobody 

415.76 421.12 A: and you knew that nothing but a scam and how much money can we make i i understand that's the n- name of the game but 

420.97 425.77 B: oh yeah and people don't realize it but the only reason we have television 

426.14 427.43 B: is to market products 

428.43 430.18 B: is to sell advertising 

430.89 431.55 A: oh sure 

431.44 437.18 B: i mean the you know any education or news value is second or third on the list 

438.24 440.35 B: it's all about making money 

441.12 443.98 A: now how much huh education there is nothing 

444.20 446.96 A: uh educational about re- the reality t._v. 

447.21 447.52 A: but if 

447.23 448.06 B: oh no 

447.65 448.23 A: that's what 

448.39 450.03 A: on the cartoons 

450.42 452.24 A: that's all they do is want to sell the uh 

453.26 453.82 A: cereals 

454.13 454.66 B: uh-huh 

454.60 455.36 A: the toys 

455.53 456.09 B: mhm 

456.49 459.30 A: you know and with reality t._v. i think it's beer 

460.41 463.84 B: well i hadn't been i'd yeah i hadn't paid attention to that 

460.53 461.51 A: is what i see 

464.67 466.10 A: i think most of the comerc- 

464.67 466.31 B: that's probably true 

466.63 468.74 A: and that's all and they're paying big bucks for this 

469.14 470.15 B: real big bucks 

470.77 476.17 B: but that w- duh -r don't they're demographics tell them that it's the beer drinkers who are watching these things 

476.57 479.49 A: i'm sure they do a study to find out who it appeals to the most 

479.27 479.93 B: yeah 

480.14 482.63 A: and like survivor the 

483.09 484.05 A: cell phone people 

484.36 486.26 A: gave them cell phones and then certain 

486.87 487.54 A: credit card 

488.13 490.39 A: you know it they were sponsored it 

490.85 494.17 A: and so it was on their logo was on everything that was there 

495.39 496.07 A: and it pr- 

496.88 499.73 A: i don't know why th- they would think that would bring a lot of people in 

502.02 503.92 B: people are just gullible i guess 

504.09 505.43 B: you know as a whole 

506.26 509.88 B: i mean i read the news and i listen to people carry on about 

511.49 513.44 B: oh i guess the latest example is 

513.57 514.53 B: a arby's 

514.76 517.32 B: that was excuse me that was my cockatiel 

517.43 517.90 B: um 

518.89 522.60 B: arby's has a new thing out with a little oven mitt 

522.94 526.65 B: that sings a little song you know when they show an arby's commercial 

526.22 527.21 A: oh yeah 

533.18 538.27 B: you know this other logo didn't do it and you know the one before that and i'm thinking for god 

538.38 545.50 B: sake they've not changed the product they've not changed the quality they've got some stupid oven mitt and they're making 

545.61 546.95 B: this whole big 

547.37 549.72 B: thing out of out of nothing you know and 

549.83 551.73 B: everybody's buying into it 

551.87 554.58 B: and it it's just rampant in our society i think 

552.05 553.44 A: well that's what they're hoping for 

555.22 557.18 A: that's what they were hoping for for the um 

557.71 559.91 A: credit cards and for on the uh 

559.16 559.84 B: yeah 

560.31 561.33 A: on the cell phones 

561.34 561.89 B: yeah 

562.20 565.48 A: and then they have even the flags or whatever on survivor had their logos on it 

565.75 566.58 B: yeah it 

566.33 568.55 A: like they think oh it's going to stick in their mind 

568.95 570.68 B: and it you know it probably will
