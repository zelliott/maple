0.09 3.00 A: [noise] hello my name is danny 

2.28 4.67 B: danny this is debra 

4.96 8.76 B: um so i guess they want to know if we think that it it 

9.05 11.26 B: it helps tighten ah 

11.94 15.24 B: the possibilities of terrorists 

15.11 29.18 A: yeah yeah i mean you know i'm sure it it does a little something but i don't think it you know they're not they're not gonna you know they're gonna be smarter than that now they d- you know they're gonna be circuitous in their methods you know 

29.07 33.25 A: they're not just gonna walk in with a knife through the metal detector you know 

32.82 33.89 B: right 

33.27 45.40 A: they already know we're looking for that so i mean i'm sure it it deters somewhat but you know it'd only deter like the lower level terrorism not any big high elaborate plans i don't think 

43.95 44.70 B: no 

44.74 52.07 B: i don't think so either i think that they need to do more with the luggage and the way they can they load the planes more so than 

52.54 54.47 B: [mn] checking people out at the 

54.69 55.54 B: um 

57.07 61.80 B: at the um security you know when you walk through the detectors 

60.18 61.17 A: right 

61.56 62.50 A: right 

61.85 69.64 B: i'm sure that it helps somewhat um it doesn't help our air travel any it slows things down in the process but 

69.23 70.83 A: oh yeah 

69.85 81.35 B: um i'm sure that it has helped to a point but i think that most of their problems come from the luggage being on there and and matching the luggage to the tickets if that person's not on there 

79.30 80.32 A: mhm 

81.46 82.72 A: mhm 

82.02 83.74 B: you know where they load their 

83.98 88.07 B: their ah luggage and i don't think that they inspect all the luggage now do they 

88.03 95.94 A: ah well i'm not sure i'm sure they they run it through some like random screening process but i don't think it's that that hard core 

89.66 90.58 B: i'm sure 

95.62 97.86 B: right right and um 

98.41 101.58 B: have you traveled much [mn] since all of nine eleven 

101.45 106.44 A: oh yeah i i just flew ah couple of days ago actually 

106.21 107.08 B: and 

106.45 112.01 A: and i mean it wasn't it wasn't too bad ah you know i had to take my shoes off you know 

107.25 108.21 B: how did you 

111.86 112.86 B: really 

112.23 118.15 A: but yeah it's kinda ri- the thing i think's ridiculous is like okay like you're about to go through 

118.00 126.91 A: and i know my belt's gonna set it off so i'm like taking off my belt to put it in my bag you know and they're rushing you like no go through now 

126.71 134.25 A: you think well it's gonna set it off right now and then you set the metal detector off once and you automatically get sent over to the you know the body search 

134.18 143.98 A: then you know they you go go through your pockets and then you know take off your shoes and you know like the little little metal rings that like your shoe laces go through 

143.61 144.67 B: (( mhm )) 

144.05 149.32 A: that's sets off the little wand so they take your shoes and put 'em through the metal detector 

149.09 159.63 A: so you know send 'em through the x-ray machine and so it's just like a it's a huge ordeal and i didn't i didn't miss my flight i was already late for it anyway but i didn't miss it still so it was all right 

159.38 163.65 B: well i guess if you're getting on the did you feel more secure getting on the plane 

163.63 164.98 A: (( ah no )) 

165.37 169.64 B: oh [mn] i flew right after nine eleven and i didn't really feel much more secure 

169.60 173.75 A: but i mean i never really um i i didn't feel any 

169.67 170.97 B: but you know 

173.89 184.49 A: more you know i i didn't think it was any more of a risk flying after nine eleven than it was before you know it's just everyone else seemed to be freaking out a lot more than before 

183.20 184.16 B: uh-huh 

185.55 191.72 A: so i mean i don- i don't think anybody really cares about my domestic flight from you know dallas to atlanta you know 

192.00 192.86 A: so 

192.03 192.96 B: (( well it's [lipsmack] uh-huh )) 

193.17 196.97 B: well i i guess they probably didn't think much about a domestic flight from 

197.32 198.62 B: um what was it 

198.69 200.16 B: new york to 

200.62 204.27 B: to where were they going chicago or pennsylvania when they 

203.26 204.22 A: yeah 

204.46 209.79 B: but it's i just don't feel like it's it's as secure as you know it's it's costing 

209.87 214.00 B: the airlines a lot and i i feel like it's it's it's harmed 

211.70 212.66 A: mhm 

214.33 215.23 B: um 

215.94 225.12 B: more so than it's actually doing good i think there's other areas that they could be concentrating and putting their money towards and more for the baggage and the 

222.78 224.13 A: oh yeah there's 

225.16 234.87 B: you know 'cause you're pretty much so going to set off that that trigger anyway you know and maybe checking the shoes is because that that guy had what he had a knife or something in his shoe 

229.30 230.38 A: oh yeah 

234.79 236.28 A: yeah something like that [noise] 

234.99 237.24 B: you know that they caught and so 

237.33 245.41 B: that's but ah i think that they've they've gone quite far with the body searches and the different things that that they're doing 

243.67 245.44 A: mhm 

246.01 250.62 B: i don't know that much about the subject to be honest with you i don't um 

252.31 253.64 B: what did you think 

253.69 254.73 B: (( jo [laughter] )) 

256.12 257.47 B: did they search you 

259.73 262.46 B: [noise] yeah you see my sister it happened the same thing 

262.44 264.33 A: mhm 

263.02 264.91 B: take your shoes off [noise] 

269.03 269.89 B: uh-huh 

271.85 274.05 B: [noise] yeah she said she got patted down 

274.18 275.96 A: yeah 

274.23 278.05 B: it was a white woman ah you know it was a lady you know [noise] 

278.70 279.83 A: (( yeah i didn't [mn] )) 

278.71 282.11 B: did they pat you down did they pat you down like like 

282.49 292.39 A: yeah yeah no he well he felt all my pockets and you know i had a lighter in one of my pockets and that s- that set off the metal detector also and i was like whoa i mean yeah they you know 

282.85 283.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

285.69 286.58 B: uh-huh 

287.74 288.64 B: uh-huh 

292.96 297.01 B: they might be abl- i would almost think that they would come u- be able to 

292.96 294.61 A: okay sorry about that 

297.37 307.36 B: produce some sort of a well i suppose x-ray on our bodies is bad you know 'cause you can- you can't do an x-ray machine on a pregnant woman or and too much x-ray in with [noise] you know 

301.36 304.04 A: yeah i yeah i don't think that'd be good 

307.48 309.82 A: yeah i think i don't think x-rays are 

307.73 320.12 B: but 'cause they only do a random search on the luggage they can't possibly search all of the luggage but they need to come up with all these x-rays i think every piece of luggage needs to be x-rayed and [noise] 

320.13 323.27 B: in all of 'em now in all the airports 

326.35 327.11 B: (( [noise] oh good )) 

327.73 328.99 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

332.03 334.20 B: well i i i don't think 

334.26 339.31 B: you know i i suppose it it h- it has helped to a point [noise] 

339.00 344.81 A: yeah i mean at least they're doing something but i mean it's probably not the the best thing they could do 

346.31 350.69 B: [mn] i think yeah the workers they need to have heightened 

350.75 351.76 B: um 

351.89 357.15 B: regulations for hiring the workers they need to do more checks 

354.53 355.56 A: oh yeah 

357.41 359.49 B: with the people that are working there 

359.35 369.19 A: oh yeah definitely for that and at least have like some kind of i don't know a hired like you know people that are trained a little bit better to do the searching 'cause i mean 

367.62 368.63 B: mhm 

369.53 377.66 A: flying out of certain airports you know you'll run into people that you know don't really they shouldn't really be doing that 

375.32 381.40 B: [noise] well most of the baggage checkers and the the security were minimum wage people 

381.12 382.85 A: yeah yeah it's 

381.60 394.13 B: you know they need to be trained security people they need to have heightened [mn] security for the the workers you know not just like anybody out there on that field to have access to those planes 

385.23 386.07 A: yeah 

393.78 394.90 A: right 

394.51 398.86 B: and ah you know if the if the if the airline people 

398.98 402.79 B: you know the baggage handlers can steal things out of your bags 

403.03 404.01 A: mhm 

403.10 407.05 B: then a baggage handler can put something in those bags 

406.69 408.56 A: right exactly 

407.95 413.72 B: and so and i d- i'm not aware of you know how much they have heightened that 

413.77 418.54 B: you know um but that to me would be more plausible than 

418.71 419.58 B: um 

420.41 422.58 B: you know patting all the the 

422.73 424.00 B: [mn] people down 

423.89 431.43 A: mhm yeah well and i think the random searches like right bef- like to go actually onto the plane like right in the terminal 

431.11 432.01 B: uh-huh 

431.76 435.05 A: i think that's that's a little better idea than you know 

435.29 440.42 A: checking peoples' shoes at the you know at the very front 'cause i mean once you're in 

440.34 454.07 A: once you pass like you know the big metal detectors and all the x-ray machines and all that then you know you're just kind of free to do whatev- whatever you want you know you can go in the bathroom and you know some- someone that works at the wendy's on the inside could you know 

453.92 461.90 A: inch ah whatever you know in the stall and then there you go you're on the plane and you got you know whatever he just gave you so 

461.27 463.23 B: that's true you're right 

462.46 465.55 A: i mean you know the check right before you get on the plane that's 

465.56 468.04 A: that's kinda 'cause i mean once you're in the air- like 

468.03 481.63 A: before you know once you're in the airport once you're like actually in the terminals you're you know you're in there and they didn't check you for anything so you could you know fly to some other airport and do whatever the hell you wanted to do and you know get on another plane 

481.49 483.66 A: go somewhere else and do whatever you wanted to do 

483.91 492.74 B: i also feel like they need to match the you know like if your bags are on there they need to match if those bags go on there they better make sure that every 

493.22 496.63 B: every person that put those bags on there is matches 

496.76 503.94 B: you know that there's gotta be somebody in other words if mr smith puts a bag on then decides not to take the flight his bags shouldn't go on there 

502.14 503.09 A: (( [noise] right )) 

503.63 507.39 A: right if he doesn't get on the plane then his bags shouldn't 

507.31 509.84 B: right and they um 

508.24 509.62 A: yeah 

510.27 512.53 B: are they just checking the bags 

512.67 513.61 B: are they 

513.64 519.55 B: just checking i mean they don't actually check every single bag that is loaded on that plane 

519.75 524.05 B: they're only random checking your carry ons if they think that there's a problem 

524.29 527.67 A: ah i that's i think that's what the the situation is 

526.71 527.29 B: [noise] 

529.16 529.72 B: (( yeah )) 

529.68 536.68 A: so i don't know i mean at least they're they're trying something but it's probably not the the best they could do 

530.32 531.11 B: (( [noise] )) 

536.59 537.76 B: [noise] correct 

537.85 539.96 B: but um [mn] 

538.81 539.47 A: [noise] 

540.51 543.77 B: i don't know the question was do we feel like it's more secure 

543.90 546.88 A: (( [noise] ah hm )) 

545.99 555.52 B: i think to a point but i feel like it could be a lot more secure but then i had i'm not i don't work there i don't know all the changes that they've made 

549.95 551.47 A: yeah right 

555.34 556.43 A: right 

556.13 560.84 B: so i couldn't [noise] justifiably say that they haven't made enough changes 

559.74 561.62 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

561.04 563.61 B: i've only flown a couple of times since then 

563.88 569.81 B: and i didn't have any problems [noise] but um [noise] you know i've heard some 

570.18 575.47 B: you know i didn't fly out of i i flew from nashville to florida a couple of times 

575.50 579.99 B: and i didn't fly in in any [noise] major airports i didn't go through 

580.00 581.54 B: atlanta nor 

581.61 583.55 B: dallas or chicago 

583.56 584.70 A: mhm 

584.11 592.11 B: so i d- i didn't entail any of those problems and of course right after nine eleven there wasn't very many people [noise] flying so there wasn't too many lines [noise] 

591.73 596.41 A: right yeah i f- i flew the weekend after nine eleven 

595.96 597.61 B: mhm [mn] 

596.66 599.95 A: but i was i was flying home from from school
