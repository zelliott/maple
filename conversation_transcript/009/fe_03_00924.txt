4.25 4.76 B: fine 

4.59 6.20 A: a i'm tess 

6.23 7.03 B: my name is kirk 

9.58 11.02 B: i'm in atlanta georgia 

11.29 12.57 A: i'm in virginia 

12.71 13.90 B: oh okay what part 

14.32 16.24 A: um up in the mountains shenandoah valley 

16.27 17.47 B: oh yeah that's nice 

17.49 19.82 A: yeah it really is a lot of snow 

19.79 20.73 B: oh okay 

20.72 22.11 A: a lot of snow but yeah 

24.27 25.16 B: um 

26.45 29.49 B: yeah i just think that uh we might be jumping the gun a little bit 

41.86 49.28 A: um i think there'd be more people that were trying to jump in and back us considering how much you know financial aid that we have given the world over 

49.61 50.43 A: more than once 

50.68 51.11 B: right 

51.53 54.96 A: but it's also is very dis- discerning to know that a 

55.10 57.15 A: you know a few weeks ago 

57.47 58.17 A: uh 

58.28 62.72 A: there was no missiles to be found and all of a sudden thirty four pop up 

62.31 62.78 B: right 

62.93 65.20 A: so that's that's kind of weird um 

65.54 69.89 A: i think the other thing that bothers me a lot um 

71.14 72.05 A: is 

72.48 73.53 A: iraq is not 

73.68 78.83 A: perturbed at anybody but the u._s. you know what i'm saying and i think that's 

76.96 77.60 B: yeah 

78.05 78.96 B: maybe britain 

79.16 79.65 A: right 

79.23 79.60 B: right 

95.33 97.84 A: so i am i'm definitely worried about it i think 

97.35 99.81 B: what do you th- what do you think is going on with colin powell 

102.13 102.55 B: yeah 

102.68 107.51 A: isn't that that something to really i think he's been brought in to to you know kind of 

108.15 109.86 A: head up some things 

109.50 113.77 B: i i'm wondering if he's just being loyal to this administration or if this is 

114.68 117.15 B: you know how he really how he really is i knew 

117.28 119.97 B: a man who's now deceased who served under him 

120.12 120.52 A: mhm 

120.66 121.45 B: and um 

121.99 124.35 B: actually i had to brief him on several things 

124.64 126.29 B: in in the past and 

126.77 130.35 B: he had a lot of admiration for him he told me some stories and 

130.47 131.21 B: i always thought 

131.34 132.81 B: thought very highly of him but 

132.95 135.94 B: you know now that this is coming on i don't know if he's 

136.35 137.86 A: it's like you're seeing a different person 

137.85 140.18 B: yeah it he does seem just 

141.02 141.80 B: you know 

142.05 143.63 B: a little trigger happy for me 

143.77 144.36 A: yeah 

144.33 144.96 B: you know 

144.46 146.13 A: yeah definitely 

145.11 146.91 B: and i'm just doing everything you would 

147.60 152.08 B: the way the economy is going the way you know some of the other things 

152.46 156.29 B: some of the other problems we are having here with terrorism and other countries 

156.89 158.70 B: you know like afghanistan 

158.61 159.36 A: exactly 

159.13 160.90 B: and then we've got korea now that 

160.99 161.50 B: you know 

162.62 163.60 A: no yeah that's 

163.22 165.34 B: if we didn't have this thing it seems like we'd be 

166.50 166.82 B: (( )) 

168.41 168.96 B: yeah 

169.70 170.19 B: yeah 

170.36 179.87 A: um but you know what i think that right now that it's it's like the president has got to be sitting back going you know do i do it first or do i wait for them to to to launch the first one 

180.14 180.68 B: yeah 

180.91 186.09 A: you know and i think i don't know at this point with this much stuff as been going on 

187.16 195.96 A: if they know were the head of this stuff is if they know were he's at then this will be their best bet go in and get him and his two sons and leave it alone 

190.29 190.72 B: mhm 

196.59 197.95 A: leave it alone 

197.35 200.77 B: yes see that i get worry that sometimes some of this might be 

201.10 206.55 B: you know george junior trying to take up for his father here too and save face that way 

215.70 216.12 B: mhm

223.42 223.78 A: yeah 

223.78 224.15 B: any 

223.88 233.11 A: i have two and i think about them all the time i think you know i mean i'm like you know i'm like a hundred and twenty miles from d._c. and that's not a lot when you're talking about bombing 

230.64 231.01 B: sure 

233.36 235.71 B: right like that when you know like 

235.94 238.43 B: september eleventh i i imagine you have to be 

239.04 241.43 B: really frightened being that close and 

240.26 240.69 A: yeah 

241.29 244.06 A: yeah it's really honestly was i mean you know it 

243.33 245.70 B: then you've got a sniper a year or so later 

245.82 251.85 A: that was huh some of the some of the people he killed were like twenty minutes from our house twenty twenty five minutes 

251.09 251.45 B: (( )) 

251.90 252.30 B: hm 

252.69 254.45 A: yeah so yeah it was definitely 

253.61 254.35 B: that's frightening 

254.78 256.06 A: definitely 

255.82 256.77 B: yeah 

256.55 265.47 A: but um i wonder wonder what they're going to find i wonder if they're they're sending troops into iraq i wonder if they are going to find uh osama bin laden there 

266.18 267.99 B: i uh that's good question 

268.10 269.69 B: i don't know but uh 

269.99 272.39 B: it seems like they've gotten everybody but him now 

272.29 275.58 A: yeah exactly but i tell you that could be the one thing 

273.28 273.74 B: yeah 

275.72 279.11 A: that is going to be the president's saving grace i think if he goes in 

279.69 280.08 B: yeah 

290.35 291.33 B: yeah that that changes 

296.27 301.92 B: yeah that changes see that changes my opinion completely i'm i'm for going in if if if he's in there 

302.09 302.52 A: right 

302.59 303.55 B: you know that's 

303.71 304.19 B: yeah 

304.30 308.11 B: i've got a son and i don't you know i'm not too crazy about 

304.50 304.83 A: yeah 

308.84 310.16 B: having him go to war but 

311.01 313.94 B: um if you know if it's for the right cause 

314.47 315.80 B: then then that's fine 

315.89 316.39 A: yeah 

315.93 316.21 B: but 

316.88 320.86 B: you know that that really would help that would help that would help help his case a lot 

336.30 336.80 B: right 

337.14 338.17 A: but you know i 

338.76 340.23 A: i think that you know from 

340.91 341.64 A: them 

352.76 354.30 A: you know disarming and 

354.60 358.36 A: (( )) scrap i think that right there says 

356.00 356.42 B: yeah 

358.46 361.20 A: they are they're hiding a lot more than what they they are 

361.30 362.71 A: bringing on 

362.22 363.91 B: yeah i don't trust them i mean i don't 

364.02 368.26 B: trust hussein or anybody you know as far as i can throw him but 

368.40 370.26 B: i'm just you know i'm just thinking that 

371.02 373.76 B: you know do we really stir things up stir the pot up 

373.99 375.39 B: and then we are going to be looked at 

375.78 383.86 B: you know from the rest of the world as especially those third world countries we are going to be looked at as you know the real aggressor and big bad america and 

384.03 384.51 A: yep 

384.50 385.53 B: that's the thing that that 

385.65 387.79 B: bothers me a little bit is you know 

387.90 389.75 B: we don't need to start a nuclear war 

390.53 395.18 A: no definitely not but you know what it's like the u._n. is is waiting for the u._s. to do something 

395.94 399.97 A: you know i think the u._n. might have a little bit more power than what anybody lets on 

412.58 414.73 B: yeah and i'm for that if the u._n. 

415.43 419.17 B: you know united nations says this is this is what needs to be done 

419.59 422.50 B: america you can be the enforcer or the leader 

422.81 426.82 B: i'm for i'm for going after but if it's if this is another vietnam 

427.20 430.78 B: that's that's what i'm that's what i'm worried about cause i was a kid during vietnam 

427.44 427.90 A: yeah 

430.95 431.88 A: so was i 

431.55 433.00 B: and i've i've seen too many 

433.64 436.84 B: you know read too many things seen too many things that 

437.46 437.77 B: just 

438.40 440.34 B: make us look really bad out of that 

440.55 441.06 B: you know 

440.70 443.76 A: oh yeah definitely i don't know 

443.95 450.29 A: we've given aid to so many countries in the united you know in the world um that it's really 

458.41 458.81 B: yeah 

491.92 492.53 B: mhm 

492.42 497.92 A: do it and get it over with you know but you know they're saying that there is like 

493.69 494.24 B: yeah 

498.10 508.00 A: two thirds of uh two thirds of their surplus of bombs that that we haven't found yet and and they're talking about all kinds of different things that they haven't found yet that they know that they have 

508.12 511.09 B: i think the element of surprise is gone when you agree that 

510.89 512.47 A: oh my gosh yes 

511.27 515.49 B: at this point we've we've sort of busted around for few month and 

530.27 531.54 B: a good analogy yeah 

531.37 541.43 A: you know and and he's got to do som- they he's got to do something you know he's he's there at the front door right now and he's either going to get maced and run home with his tail in between his legs or he's going to have somebody 

541.56 545.03 A: you know seat of their pants in their mouth when they come back home 

544.28 548.70 B: yeah i'm surprised tony blair he you know that he doesn't have as much approval 

549.57 551.14 B: in england you know it's just 

551.40 552.09 B: see that's what 

552.83 555.07 B: that being bush's big um 

556.00 557.52 B: you know ally that 

557.83 564.05 B: you know they're they've been so tight anyway but that i sort of discount that a little bit you know if it 

560.14 560.55 A: right 

564.25 567.00 B: maybe if we had three or four global leaders 

567.48 569.15 B: that we're all together on this 

569.14 569.61 A: right 

569.61 571.42 B: but this blair and bush that's just 

571.97 574.25 B: to me it's just not quite enough for 

572.03 572.82 A: it hurts 

574.12 575.13 A: yeah it's scary 

583.33 586.53 B: so you know it looks like a to me it just looks like another vietnam 

586.89 591.12 A: yeah it's it's getting up to be a especially with how many people we've got over there right know 

591.11 592.71 B: yeah that's that's what's uh
