4.41 6.05 B: yes liz l. i. z. 

5.75 7.32 A: hi liz 

6.70 8.05 B: hi how are you jo 

7.86 8.90 A: okay 

8.46 9.08 B: (( good )) 

9.00 10.65 A: is this your first time 

10.19 11.11 B: it is 

11.16 12.46 A: mine too 

11.93 13.66 B: (( well good [laughter] )) 

13.06 14.24 A: (( all right )) 

13.82 16.42 B: i guess we have to keep on the topic then don't we 

15.38 21.56 A: yes bioterrorism a tough subject with no easy answers 

17.45 18.66 B: yes 

19.17 20.30 B: well what do you think 

21.29 29.43 B: there's no easy answers and i don't believe that there's any quick answers either look how long we've been battling it here in the united states as it is 

24.85 26.59 A: (( mhm )) 

28.93 30.25 A: that's right 

29.76 31.22 B: you are from the u._s. 

31.37 32.54 A: i'm sorry 

31.49 33.48 B: are you in the united states okay 

32.64 34.71 A: oh yes yes in florida 

34.23 35.80 B: oh i'm in michigan 

35.46 36.74 A: (( oh all right )) 

36.58 39.16 B: i hear it's warmer down there than it is up here 

38.63 39.87 A: oh 

39.91 42.49 A: it definitely it's nice 

42.69 53.59 B: i think that if they are going to attack if the people are going to have some sort of bioterrorism attack on some place in the united states don't you feel uncomfortable living in florida being that's such a tourist state 

53.92 65.35 A: well to tell you the truth i hadn't thought about it in that light although we do have a large military base and air force base which is central command 

54.44 55.83 B: does that concern you 

58.74 59.81 B: i'm sorry 

65.07 66.03 B: (( aha that's true )) 

65.43 68.58 A: so that certainly could be a target 

69.13 72.76 A: although other states have them too and i think just 

73.13 82.80 A: the idea of it or what they can do or what the experience with anthrax did certainly shows you how easily things could be shut down 

82.25 84.24 B: that didn't take much that was 

83.93 84.99 A: that's right 

84.34 89.08 B: found in two locations and look the whole entire u._s. mail system got shut down 

89.55 98.38 A: i can't say i have a quick answer i do think that continuing on the path that this country is following right now 

98.87 102.19 A: to me increases people's 

102.20 106.20 A: sense that we're arrogant and only know the use of force 

105.80 106.64 B: right 

106.40 109.32 A: even though they can't admit that 

109.29 121.71 A: very low tech things could bring us down and i think it's very hard for any powerful government to admit that but we're in pretty much a different world the way i look at it and 

120.17 121.17 B: right 

121.92 128.30 A: other than trying to find a way to deal with the discontents of people or 

128.15 143.12 A: the anger or hatred of people i don't know of any method i don't think giving us all gas masks or putting plastic and duct tape all around our house is really practical or feasible [laughter] what about you 

137.75 139.50 B: right 

142.77 151.18 B: i don't think it's very comfortable either [laughter] well i think it might have been peter jennings or dan rather on one of the nightly newscasts one night who said 

144.52 146.15 A: (( [laughter] no )) 

151.38 162.70 B: apparently there was a bomb in one of the subways over in one of the other countries and he said that it doesn't really seem like it's going to take a big event that can take make things crumble it will just take many small events 

162.38 163.29 A: mhm 

162.87 165.92 B: because one guy one bomb can take out one hundred and twenty people 

165.63 168.02 A: well that's true we've had the domestic 

168.18 174.91 A: incidents to prove that but also it's what you do that destroys a lot 

169.69 170.99 B: exactly 

175.16 189.74 A: of what our country is founded on in the effort to tighten up i think it deprives us of a lot of the things that make this country what it is or what it was mhm yeah 

186.06 189.11 B: our constitutional rights or freedom right 

189.68 203.00 B: yeah i mean here we are we're basing all of our livelihood on freedom because we have you know it's the fifth amendment that we of all these freedoms and rights but here when it comes down to somebody wanting to take those away we all are pretty frightened 

202.16 207.73 A: do you think that the use of force such as missile defence systems 

207.60 218.71 A: and massing all these troops on the border regardless of what happens there do you think that will reduce the possibility of terrorism or bioterrorism 

218.55 227.98 B: the only thing that that's going to really work on i believe would be the prospect for nuclear war or a big full scale war but you've still got the little 

228.34 232.13 B: chemist in the backyard who can come up with something that is bio terror 

230.39 235.97 A: well nuclear war is the principle of mutual annihilation 

235.52 237.11 B: (( right )) 

235.93 249.74 A: which most sensible people would back away from but if you've got people willing to kill themselves even on small scale terrorism then i don't think they're concerned about nuclear deterrents [laughter] 

244.52 245.41 B: right 

248.44 252.45 B: no because these are people who are willing to take their life also 

250.60 253.40 A: that's right that's right that's why 

252.73 254.21 B: kamikazes 

253.84 263.92 A: yeah it's political really the article i've been reading says that this so called system now if you call it that is really not based on force 

264.02 266.00 A: that will do any good 

265.95 279.32 A: but only on the politics of what's in back of this and until we learn how to deal with that and i don't mean appeasement but ah as long as you say people are willing to blow themselves up on a small or large scale 

273.00 273.74 B: right 

279.61 284.32 A: what good are billion dollar star wars defence systems 

283.85 284.66 B: right 

284.34 296.90 A: it's not a missile flying over the ocean we need to worry about it's the guy in the backyard or maybe maybe a woman but probably a guy in the backyard that's a little prejudiced but 

287.68 289.10 B: (( right )) 

290.42 294.29 B: (( [laughter] )) 

295.56 299.54 B: a woman's cooking dinner the man is taking care of the biological problems 

296.69 300.41 A: [laughter] she's taking care of the baby right 

300.74 304.42 B: all he has to do is go to the bathroom and we have biological warfare 

303.67 306.25 A: oh absolutely that's true 

305.98 307.26 B: in our house 

306.64 311.63 A: i think anybody who pretends they have an easy or facile answer for this 

311.42 323.29 A: but i still believe in the sense that it is political until we deal with the issues and it's not because they're poor deprived i mean certainly they're easier fodder for somebody to brainwash 

319.34 320.30 B: right 

322.74 330.56 B: right but all classes of life are affected whether it's the little mum and pop store down the road or whether it's the big 

325.60 326.87 A: that's right 

330.61 332.60 B: donald trumps of the world 

331.87 338.34 A: or even the middle class stock market investors like me [laughter] 

334.64 336.07 B: exactly 

336.21 339.54 B: (( yeah exactly [laughter] )) 

338.72 345.00 A: that's true that's why i believe the only way to look for any possible way of diffusing this 

345.33 347.05 A: that's a funny word to use 

346.58 348.83 B: (( right )) 

347.54 362.29 A: is through a political or human or social context to me that's about the only help you have and you're going to stand there with a big gun blustering our way through it [laughter] i'm sorry i don't think it's going to work 

352.56 353.53 B: right 

361.64 366.25 B: and you'd have to have all the parties willing to have that human component 

365.09 369.96 A: right and there has got to be something that can so to speak get them to the table 

369.48 370.26 B: right 

370.15 384.70 A: so what that is i have no idea [laughter] i think most people don't think the method we are pursuing is it's like a pseudo solution like oh we'll brandish a big muscle and frighten them no i don't think so 

384.20 386.96 B: it worked for us in the past but we're technolo- 

386.74 388.01 A: that's right 

387.07 390.98 B: technologically more advanced now in the world than we were back then 

389.51 403.10 A: that's right and i think it must be very frustrating for those who believe in guns to think that butter might help [laughter] i think they're so used to the idea of us being so powerful 

396.26 397.13 B: yeah 

397.56 398.55 B: [laughter] 

402.77 404.11 B: right 

403.11 410.60 A: and it must be extremely frustrating and they're in denial that there isn't a solution based upon armament 

410.39 411.72 B: (( right i know )) 

410.99 411.81 A: but 

412.07 419.58 A: i doubt it this is a perfect topic [laughter] i wonder if the computer picked it or do they just randomly do that 

414.07 415.37 B: [laughter] 

418.87 420.72 B: it's a very hot topic 

420.37 426.78 A: oh yeah as long as you're have one eye open it's bound to be [laughter] 

424.96 435.50 B: yeah and you kind of have to listen i mean you need to pay attention to the worldly newses to find out you know where we are at with where is north korea with their building of their nuclear they've got their power plant up and running 

435.18 436.46 A: mhm 

435.54 440.30 B: you know where do we stand with chemists that are missing or people who may be 

440.31 443.67 B: you know things that are happening in the movies are real life today 

443.91 451.17 A: well you know and also although it may be true these aren't nice people calling them the axis of evil is like calling a small child 

451.53 457.09 A: difficult names and the child is going to live up to the difficult names [laughter] that you call them 

455.01 456.10 B: exactly 

456.72 458.01 B: yeah exactly 

457.25 460.64 A: that's a little simplistic but i still think there's some truth to it 

460.03 468.14 B: yeah plus some of them probably enjoy that name they want the recognition they want the attention they want to go down feeling like they're a martyr 

464.73 466.81 A: (( that's right )) 

467.51 475.75 A: right and if you can't get it in a positive way you'll get it in the most negative way possible you'll you'll get attention we can't ignore you 

471.62 472.77 B: and cultural 

475.38 476.70 B: that's right 

477.12 480.44 B: i am here i will have a temper tantrum whether you like it or not 

479.57 489.96 A: that's exactly right so what do we do with children like that you're not supposed to reward negativity we'll have to go back to the kindergarten [laughter] and figure out how to do this 

481.32 482.01 B: (( yeah )) 

490.02 493.48 B: i don't know some of our kindergarteners aren't doing so good these days either 

492.36 496.05 A: yeah that's true well i think the atmosphere 

495.82 496.95 B: right 

496.09 499.64 A: and i could call it f. e. a. r. atmosphere 

498.99 500.32 B: fear exactly 

501.15 507.37 A: i do think even if they don't really understand i think some of that gets through to children 

506.94 508.19 B: (( i do too right )) 

507.39 512.15 A: i have grandchildren and i think it's very sad maybe it was never truly 

512.61 523.29 A: an innocent world only the illusion of it but i tell you what i'd settle for that illusion just so they could grow up i do think it's responsible for a lot of 

523.24 531.49 A: bad behaviour on the part of young people because they're trying to escape from that underlying fear even if it's not acknowledged 

531.57 537.46 A: in almost any way they can usually something that's kind of semi destructive in its own way 

537.40 543.21 B: now are you guys anyone down there getting actual starting to get the smallpox smallpox vaccinations 

542.65 557.26 A: i don't know i've heard that some of the health care workers not too many across the country out of the projected ones so i don't know specifically if some of the so called first responders or health care people here have taken it i really haven't 

557.14 558.64 A: focussed on that 

557.16 567.72 B: they've act they've actually started it up here up we're just in the northern ohio region right over the border so toledo ohio has actually started getting their smallpox smallpox vaccinations 

561.21 562.87 A: oh really mhm 

566.85 570.13 A: well then it may be all right unless they come up with some other 

570.35 573.89 A: lethal germ that isn't covered by that vaccine 

571.96 573.33 B: right 

573.51 574.72 B: anthrax 

574.92 577.80 B: that's like a baby powder fine formula that 

574.94 575.68 A: (( yes )) 

577.92 580.35 B: i don't know i guess it's not that hard to create 

580.06 582.77 A: ooh evident it's a naturally 

581.11 584.74 B: although i would have no clue how to do that 

583.70 585.76 A: occurring substance 

585.25 587.93 B: i would have no clue how to make that stuff but 

587.01 596.14 A: they can as they say weaponize it or whatever the latest terminology we're all getting very expert in vocabulary for what to call everything 

593.93 594.87 B: (( yes )) 

595.81 598.59 B: yeah politically correct wording 

596.47 597.82 A: (( yeah it is )) 

598.36 599.89 A: it's not a fun time
