5.26 9.24 A: my favorite erica my favorite holiday erica would just be 

9.74 11.07 A: make a friend day 

11.95 14.82 A: and i would celebrate it by having people 

15.40 19.26 A: just to go and introduce themselves to some folks that they don't know 

19.72 22.74 A: find out what their likes and dislikes are 

23.27 26.90 A: find out how they could make them a better person 

27.09 27.61 A: maybe 

28.55 36.20 A: get together and have a barbecue or a cook-out and just -cause i just think that people are just so afraid now with everything happening 

36.38 36.69 A: that 

36.89 40.82 A: everybody is afraid to approach anybody or say anything or scared 

40.93 43.80 A: they speak somebody might beat -em up or 

44.44 46.97 A: say something ugly to them so i think 

47.58 54.86 A: make a friend day would be a good day that we could just rejoice and start counting our blessings and and let 

55.16 61.71 A: everybody know that it's going to be alright and god is still in charge and the sun still shines and the wind is still blowing 

62.76 67.74 A: and i just think that would be a great day to to celebrate it it would be on the calendar 

67.90 71.69 A: for like the seventh of the month because i like the number seven and 

79.07 81.18 A: and that would be my favorite holiday 

87.37 87.88 B: random acts (( of )) 

88.25 88.63 B: kindness 

88.80 91.23 B: day instead of random acts of kindness week 

99.43 100.08 B: run with them 

102.11 104.16 B: walk up to somebody like you know i've been 

104.34 105.60 B: going to school at u._s._f. 

106.38 108.09 B: and find a stranger that looks 

108.19 109.58 B: lonely and new to the 

109.92 111.05 B: school and uh 

111.79 113.22 B: just introduce myself 

114.74 118.26 B: do something nice for them like even just giving them a compliment 

119.31 123.03 B: you know and i know that that could really make their day and make a difference in their life 

124.42 126.22 B: i've even worked with um 

126.46 130.48 B: foster children so i know what random acts of kindness can do 

130.99 131.96 B: so much for 

132.22 133.48 B: somebody like um 

134.07 136.67 B: even the foster angel giving (( )) program i could 

136.78 137.22 B: see what 

138.02 144.70 B: would happen at christmas when um people would do a random act of kindness and pick out the angel with the kid's name on it 

145.35 148.40 B: buy them presents when they had never even met the children 

148.74 150.61 B: it's just so that they could have a normal christmas 

152.38 154.52 B: they are already going through so much being (( )) as 

154.63 155.01 B: wa- 

156.20 158.26 B: so i'd create a holiday like that 

158.82 161.13 B: and put it on a calendar and have everybody just kind of 

161.94 163.75 B: put aside work or 

164.36 165.24 B: whatever all 

165.40 167.37 B: it is that they do socially and 

168.05 169.79 B: use that as a time to uh 

170.88 173.17 B: get to know people and you know just 

173.52 174.71 B: be nice to each other

337.11 340.09 A: depends on their parents or depends on an adult 

340.26 345.66 A: to feed them and nourish them and then the adult can't even provide for themselves or their child 

346.09 353.80 A: you know so sometimes that makes me just sit back and you know count my blessings and i get my bills and i think okay i can't do all this 

353.91 365.81 A: there is somebody out there that you know would just love to have a (( steady )) roof over their head and at christmas time people seem to forget about their woes and woeth me and you know they are more willing to 

368.00 368.48 A: and they just 

368.77 375.20 A: seem like they feel the spirit more and it's not so much i don't like you and i don't know you they you know have all these p- 

375.34 377.63 A: parties and they invite people over and 

377.99 387.55 A: you know and and the spirit of giving and love is there and i just wish a lot of time that is why i said i would like to have to have a make a friend day and will like

430.92 436.46 A: so that's my next holiday that is already established -cause people are just more friendlier than
