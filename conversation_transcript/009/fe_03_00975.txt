22.53 25.72 A: i will start with an example that i eh 

25.93 30.35 A: a situation that i have come across while traveling in the airport 

30.75 31.77 A: and that was 

32.16 32.76 A: um 

32.99 37.76 A: in february of two thousand and two i was traveling with 

38.04 41.37 A: two friends of mine who are both black and i'm white 

41.74 44.19 A: and we were flying up to vermont to go skiing 

44.96 45.61 A: and 

45.90 48.53 A: we went through the airport in vermont 

48.88 54.15 A: and i walked through just fine and when they walked through the the uh the metal detector 

54.45 58.81 A: the metal detector didn't go off but they both of them were chosen i guess at random 

58.96 60.32 A: to have uh 

60.59 65.50 A: like they padded down and have a hand held metal detector used on them then 

65.66 71.64 A: they made them take their shoes off and run those through that conveyor belt thing that you have to put your bags through 

71.87 74.00 A: to make sure there weren't bombs in their shoes 

74.39 79.93 B: oh and so you feel like that they were probably singled out because of their color 

80.35 81.72 A: basically yes 

82.83 86.41 B: well um i will tell you a situation i don't travel um 

86.47 87.07 A: okay 

86.77 91.38 B: by air so but um a friend of mine um in the airport 

91.83 92.83 B: at atlanta 

93.33 93.90 B: um 

95.01 95.86 B: the uh 

97.43 99.55 B: the security that she went through 

99.92 100.57 B: the lady 

100.68 101.11 B: was 

101.27 101.97 B: black 

102.51 104.35 B: and my friend is white 

104.77 106.20 B: and um 

106.52 111.23 B: she felt that she was just really treated badly because of her color 

111.83 115.94 B: and she was also made to take off her shoes and and run through the machine and 

120.28 121.62 B: i think that 

122.01 124.28 B: uh we've heard stories 

124.79 127.11 B: of little old ladies 

128.03 128.56 A: mhm 

128.43 129.06 B: um 

135.60 136.21 A: yes 

136.30 137.03 B: um 

139.51 139.85 B: think 

140.39 141.40 B: we go from 

142.07 143.75 B: one extreme to the other 

145.22 149.73 A: well over all i think for the better we have found more things 

149.84 151.87 A: that could have been potentially harmful 

152.92 155.78 A: uh because of this new system that has been in p- uh 

156.14 157.92 A: that is being used at the airports 

158.96 164.71 A: because of their their new screening techniques i think we are actually they are doing a better much better job 

165.20 169.08 A: but i mean i don't know when they're going through our bags are they stealing more things 

170.16 177.43 A: because i i have a younger brother and he's traveled to japan and he didn't he had you know those little locks on his luggage 

177.91 181.07 A: and they when they were searching through his bags they had stolen 

181.18 183.45 A: the people in the one of the airports i don't know if it was 

183.82 187.40 A: uh the baltimore airport or the airport in japan he bought 

187.53 190.30 A: hundred dollar hundreds of dollars in souvenirs 

190.70 197.04 A: uh like chopsticks and (( nunchucks )) and all these different things and they had taken his (( nunchucks )) because i guess they thought that they were being 

197.40 209.09 A: they were potentially harmful but he bought like chopsticks and like tea pots and stuff and was traveling with them and when he got back to baltimore they were all gone out of his bag and all the little locks had been broken off 

209.93 218.23 A: so i mean they technically they ask you not to put the locks but now there's no locks you have no you have no privacy against people working there taking you're belongings 

218.56 220.15 A: and it's not like the airports have 

220.54 224.22 A: a lot of insurance that they're giving us travelers where 

224.32 228.20 A: their policies are going to be so great that they're going to replace everything that's taken from you 

229.11 234.69 B: so is that did your brother was he compensated for the things that he lost or 

234.84 239.40 A: i think they might have given him a hundred dollars they compensated for him somewhat 

240.24 251.71 A: but because uh they didn't know if it was uh it was uh i think the airline had to compensate because you know they don't the airports don't was it the people in japan or was it in baltimore where they took the stuff out because at both points they perform checks i assume 

254.49 255.53 A: so it's interesting 

255.85 257.25 A: where'd you go to college 

257.49 262.53 B: um i am ha- have not went to college uh 

262.32 263.07 A: oh okay 

263.26 263.81 B: um 

264.81 268.75 B: locally here southwest virginia community college i have some 

270.97 271.54 A: okay 

271.33 272.17 B: um 

272.65 276.00 B: but i'm not a college grad where did you say you was going to college 

276.25 277.53 A: i got to u. penn 

277.72 278.03 B: oh 

278.65 279.52 B: oh okay 

279.84 281.79 B: so that's how you found out about this study 

282.16 282.81 A: yes 

284.06 290.12 A: i think it's great i mean they give you ten dollars every time but they only apparently will let you do it three times 

290.56 291.44 B: um 

291.82 292.31 B: i don't 

291.82 292.81 A: that's what i heard 

292.86 295.60 B: yeah why we were told that um 

297.18 300.92 B: initially it'll be for the first it will be three times 

301.39 301.89 A: mhm 

301.44 304.14 B: at the end you may be chosen um to 

304.30 306.21 B: to go five more times 

306.56 307.66 A: oo 

307.82 308.43 B: um 

308.85 309.36 B: so 

309.99 310.44 B: maybe 

310.73 313.23 B: you'd be in there you know you just uh keep your 

317.55 318.57 A: yeah i hope so 

319.62 330.30 A: but overall i think that the airports all of these things that have proceeded nine eleven have been for the better except for the homeland security act which i don't i don't like that it's just it 

329.43 330.00 B: how 

330.80 331.43 B: go ahead 

330.90 333.70 A: it just scares the people in america 

336.90 337.93 A: i'm eighteen 

337.93 343.40 B: you're eighteen okay i'm i'm thirty-eight um um 

339.15 339.74 A: yeah 

340.82 341.75 A: okay 

344.33 349.46 B: i've heard i tend to agree with you i think that um 

350.00 353.06 B: everything that's being done is probably for the better 

359.23 361.29 B: um i'm kind of scared of that 

361.19 371.04 A: i mean who who needs to be worried you know they're they're coming on c._n._n. and going the alert status is orange now everyone go get your duct tape and plastic uh plastic wrap 

383.14 394.15 A: the weather channel it said there's going to be a big blizzard everyone go buy your toilet paper bread and milk and everyone goes out and buys it and then the the food stores sell out of it just like all all the home depots sold out of duct tape 

394.19 395.97 B: right and our loews here 

396.11 396.57 B: um 

396.18 404.07 A: exactly everyone is sold out of duct tape but and and nothing even happens it's just that they come on and tell us that it's orange now i mean what's orange going to do you know 

404.16 404.84 B: yeah 

405.43 415.28 A: and now now we're back down to yellow i think it is uh and and and it's still like where we have to be on alert well what are we going to be on alert for because there's always going to be something that could potentially happen 

415.02 415.72 B: right 

415.83 417.84 B: i agree i agree with you there 

418.30 418.82 B: um 

420.56 423.60 B: uh i i know i read a discussion the other day 

424.00 425.41 B: where um 

426.95 428.90 B: do we alarm the people 

429.38 433.20 B: um eh my problem is that eh they tell us 

433.73 435.77 B: like you it's you know it's orange 

436.20 436.48 B: but 

436.69 439.10 B: what is the threat where is the threat 

450.65 451.16 B: right 

450.83 454.25 A: so everyone is going to be looking to single out minorities at the airport 

454.40 454.95 B: right 

456.39 456.89 B: so 

462.82 464.42 B: it um eh 

463.14 463.59 A: really 

464.54 467.17 B: i i don't i'm scared of heights first of all 

467.16 468.27 A: okay 

467.59 468.03 B: so 

468.35 470.23 B: um but even if 

470.64 471.62 B: i wasn't 

471.82 472.35 B: um 

472.53 476.85 B: after nine eleven i wouldn't travel abroad i wouldn't fly 

477.45 477.99 B: um 

478.46 480.51 B: uh has that effected your travel 

481.35 490.66 A: me not at all because if we start to believe that they're going to strike us again and they're going to do this again then they we're just they're they're cre- they 

490.81 500.37 A: have accomplished they're goals the whole goal of a terrorist is to instill fear in the country that they've attacked and since they've done this now people 

500.46 505.42 A: i remember what this september eleventh happened when i was preparing for college 

505.85 506.55 A: and 

506.98 509.80 A: um my college tutor had planned a trip 

524.42 525.71 A: filing for bankruptcy 

526.01 528.55 A: all these airlines have lost all this money because 

528.67 537.18 A: the terrorists have accomplished exactly what they wanted to do which is scare all the americans into not flying and to think that anyone at any time could be killed 

537.39 540.01 B: right well and that's 

544.88 545.99 B: so to speak you 

548.13 551.00 B: you don't want to travel but you don't want to 

551.48 555.36 B: to let them think that they have won and accomplished their goal like you said 

555.77 556.25 A: mhm 

566.57 568.06 A: at that time we needed
