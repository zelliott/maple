0.26 1.42 A: hello 

0.95 2.31 B: (( hello )) 

2.20 4.00 A: hi my name is amy 

3.93 7.49 B: amy hi amy my name is june 

7.60 8.95 A: nice to meet you june 

10.75 15.54 B: and i understand our topic is what the u._s. can do about bioterrorism 

15.45 19.29 A: yes present a bioterrorist attack on the united states 

18.87 20.21 B: right 

20.51 22.02 A: (( [cough] )) 

21.06 23.53 B: so what are your views on that 

24.83 30.21 A: well it will be interesting to see what happens if we go to war with iraq 

30.26 32.55 A: and i believe that we are 

33.01 34.43 A: in that direction 

34.67 35.78 B: mhm 

35.17 37.47 A: and if we are able to 

41.10 42.63 A: get 

42.75 49.84 A: saddam hussein out of power because i believe he is probably our biggest threat when it comes to bioterrorist attacks 

49.56 51.97 B: yes he's the key on that one 

51.80 52.76 A: right 

54.50 58.10 A: so it'll i think that's going to be what the tenet 

58.60 62.33 A: and you know now that we've had an attack on the united states 

62.39 63.37 B: mhm 

62.91 66.51 A: i think the idea that it can be done successfully 

66.98 70.71 A: from other terrorist groups has just become fuel 

71.30 72.21 A: (( so )) 

72.51 75.58 A: it's a very interesting subject what do you think 

75.34 78.78 B: um i'm line in in line with you i was 

79.43 87.30 B: i don't think that we're going to be able to resolve this until we did have an all out war and go after saddam hussein 

87.17 88.08 A: right 

87.85 91.44 B: and that's most unfortunate but 

91.97 97.92 B: the attack has been made on the u._s. and i don't think that we'll ever be able to 

97.93 99.66 B: rest easy again 

99.53 100.47 A: right 

100.02 102.27 B: because we know that we're all vulnerable 

102.21 103.32 A: right 

102.98 107.94 B: until we let people like him know that we are serious 

108.26 111.54 B: in defending our country from these terrorists 

111.29 112.73 A: right 

112.24 113.80 B: and um 

115.74 122.66 B: i think that we're going about it in the right way we have to stand our ground we can't back down 

121.31 122.10 A: right 

122.43 123.34 A: right 

123.52 125.71 B: and you know even if 

126.48 130.68 B: france and germany [sigh] and somewhat to 

130.74 132.17 B: all of a sudden 

132.25 133.55 B: not stand with 

134.28 135.03 B: (( us )) 

135.72 137.86 B: i don't think we have any choice 

138.16 140.69 B: but to try and prevail 

138.23 139.03 A: right 

140.90 145.02 B: in going after saddam it should he should have been gotten years ago 

144.91 148.22 A: correct yeah i think our peace talks have gone on 

148.28 149.99 A: for long enough [laughter] 

149.61 156.31 B: absolutely absolutely and as a result look what's happened i mean 

154.70 155.60 A: right 

156.32 163.71 B: we talked about it and talked about it and they're just coming back and building you know more attacks against the u._s. 

163.80 164.88 A: right 

164.27 167.48 B: and you know it's really 

168.49 170.14 B: scary i 

170.38 173.48 B: mean i'm scared for my children and my grandchildren 

173.08 173.86 A: (( yes )) 

173.85 183.48 B: you know to be in this country i mean i don't know what's going to what they're going to have in store for them in a few years if something isn't done today 

179.81 180.61 A: right 

184.07 185.85 A: and i think [cough] 

188.43 194.72 A: i think what has been happening i think americans have become too comfortable to the point where they're like 

194.98 198.00 A: any teenager who would say i'm invincible 

197.79 198.61 B: (( aha )) 

198.50 202.61 A: because a lot of these things happen all over the world on a regular basis 

202.27 203.20 B: mhm 

202.78 204.64 A: and we've been immune to it 

204.64 205.67 B: yeah 

205.25 206.43 A: so i think it's 

206.70 211.90 A: healthy in one sense because now we have our eyes opened that no we're not invincible 

211.54 212.74 B: (( right )) 

212.11 217.14 A: and we have to work together with other countries to defeat this problem 

217.48 218.41 A: and 

219.10 222.28 A: i don't know what the u._s. can do to 

222.63 223.56 A: um 

224.52 228.90 A: keep you know bioterrorism off of our shores 

229.09 237.29 A: except that you know we have to be very careful with our security we have to work together among ourselves you know with the f._b._i. and c._i._a. 

237.40 238.42 A: in just 

239.28 240.56 A: communicating 

240.89 243.03 A: what they've found and 

243.21 247.44 A: letting us know as americans you know we need to be very cautious right now 

247.41 253.76 B: right and i think that americans typically are being more cautious i mean 

252.15 252.90 A: (( yeah )) 

254.59 257.37 B: i set a suitcase down 

258.02 261.82 B: at the entrance to a gift shop when i was travelling 

261.59 262.56 A: mhm 

261.90 273.68 B: just because the aisles were a little small but i could keep my eye on it you know the whole time because i was just reaching in to get a soft drink and i mean immediately somebody was like oh there's 

265.41 266.22 A: right 

269.40 270.35 A: right 

274.05 276.32 B: (( a an unattended )) 

276.40 277.37 B: suitcase 

277.22 278.28 A: (( uh-oh )) 

277.95 284.87 B: you know and security i mean it's like whoa whoa whoa whoa that's mine that's mine but the gift shop was near a door 

284.98 285.79 A: (( yeah )) 

285.18 292.22 B: and it didn't look like anybody and i mean i was just i had my eye on it the whole time just to get just to get a soft drink 

290.47 291.30 A: right 

291.79 292.87 A: right 

292.39 293.99 B: and you know but 

294.14 297.22 B: a few years ago nobody would have thought anything about it 

296.83 297.78 A: right 

297.49 307.69 B: and i think now that we as people i know i'm more cautious if i see unattended you know things i do think that 

301.59 302.58 A: mhm 

309.11 317.98 B: you know the heightened security and it's gone from the top all the way down to the local levels because now everyone's part of this homeland security 

317.62 318.41 A: yes 

318.92 323.95 B: that the thing that i think is is that they're saying that they don't profile 

324.05 329.85 B: and i think that they have to in something like this there are just certain groups of people that 

330.37 333.01 B: have a higher likelihood 

333.32 335.81 B: of being a terrorist 

335.47 338.20 A: right and that's a very difficult thing to say 

336.40 336.99 B: (( and )) 

337.44 341.22 B: it's very difficult but to think that 

341.76 348.03 B: gee you know let's go after a grandmother or a baby that's a 

348.14 349.85 B: very caucasian 

349.87 350.90 B: (( although )) 

351.31 354.78 B: these terrorists could be any disguise 

354.76 355.67 A: right 

355.18 357.91 B: they could be as american 

358.40 367.01 B: looking as i am as a caucasian blonde you know but i think that we do have to look 

361.86 362.69 A: right 

367.06 367.95 B: at 

368.77 375.30 B: those people that fit the profile of the terrorists that we we know have already attacked us 

375.14 376.06 A: right 

375.46 377.94 B: and there are other groups like that out there 

378.11 387.29 B: that are terrorist groups and we know that they're here and i think that we we can't just say well they didn't fall into a random 

387.38 388.27 B: you know 

388.50 389.85 B: selection 

389.58 390.57 A: right 

391.16 392.53 B: i'm sorry 

393.39 396.69 B: we're going to have to give up some of our freedoms 

396.77 399.56 B: in order to protect our long term freedom 

399.75 402.05 A: well i think it's definitely a thing where 

403.55 411.11 A: those in charge of our security definitely have to profile because they've been doing this more and more 

407.03 407.97 B: mhm 

411.32 413.25 A: they know more about this than we do 

412.79 417.25 B: right it's just a shame that they have to try and disuse 

417.65 420.69 B: you know the profiling which 

419.61 420.49 A: right 

421.23 422.18 B: i mean 

422.55 424.83 B: jeeze if it was you know 

426.47 428.08 B: middle aged 

428.26 434.14 B: white caucasian blond women that were doing this then i would expect to be profiled as well 

433.76 434.73 A: (( right they )) 

434.27 441.68 B: you know because i would accept that you know and knowing that i'm not the terrorist i wouldn't feel 

435.16 437.61 A: (( can dye their hair [laughter] )) 

441.71 449.01 B: i wouldn't feel like my rights were being violated because i was being closely scrutinized 

448.58 449.66 A: mhm 

449.34 450.45 B: because 

450.76 459.87 B: my long term goal here is to have you know a free country that we don't have these terrorists terrorizing us 

458.32 459.18 A: right 

459.76 468.71 A: right the trouble comes i think because america is made up with so many different nationalities and cultures that is what makes us america 

466.11 467.20 B: oh yeah 

468.76 474.86 A: i would just hate to see something like happen like it did in i think world war two where they tried to 

476.50 477.74 A: lock up 

477.75 479.28 A: japanese people 

479.11 480.20 B: oh yeah 

479.58 482.82 A: because japan was coming against us 

483.07 491.39 A: i think you know i think you're right i think profiling is just a way of life and we profile in so many different ways that we don't 

490.16 491.10 B: oh yeah 

491.80 493.98 A: even consider it profiling but it is 

493.29 495.14 B: right right 

494.22 495.81 A: something that we have to do 

496.19 498.49 A: and so 

498.66 499.75 A: i think 

500.29 507.08 A: what makes us the strong nation that we are accepting of different people and we allow people to have freedoms here 

507.15 508.15 A: (( and )) 

508.33 513.90 A: i think our security on the national level specifically airports needs to become very tight 

514.99 516.51 A: but 

516.97 521.47 A: i think in order for us to remain a strong country that we are 

521.75 524.00 A: we have to continue to 

524.02 527.80 A: have open arms to different people within reason and say 

526.95 528.61 B: absolutely 

527.96 540.13 A: you know if you're seeking refuge we're you know we're going to welcome you here and even if you are of middle eastern descent and you are not and you are cleared of any kind of a security risk then we will gladly accept you into our country 

539.86 540.81 B: right 

540.47 541.33 A: you know 

541.83 548.02 B: we just recently had a family care locally that was 

548.24 551.80 B: (( they had been rid into our community )) 

552.88 553.81 B: here 

553.82 556.51 B: and they were of eastern origin 

556.58 557.64 B: (( and )) 

558.06 559.96 B: they just got deported 

560.36 565.21 B: and i mean there were so many people behind them trying to keep them here 

565.03 565.99 A: mhm 

565.56 567.10 B: you know but 

567.23 573.47 B: the way that it worked out they weren't able to stay and there's going to be some of that 

573.08 573.97 A: right 

574.32 584.47 B: i'm sure because we don't live in a perfect world and so there are going to be some things that fall through the cracks but that's something we're going to have to deal with 

576.97 578.13 A: right 

584.75 590.13 B: there again keeping a well long term goal you know in mind 

588.72 590.79 A: right right 

590.23 593.06 B: and i 

593.35 595.64 B: personally you know [laughter] 

596.14 599.89 B: don't i mean i would like to just go in and round up the terrorist
