114.50 117.02 A: in hot water in a lot of places 

116.69 119.74 B: yeah you know i think it all stems to

125.55 137.58 B: everything that you know us americans couldn't get you know and uh no p- taxes and so forth like that so you know in a way you have to look at it that we asked for it you know or we welcomed it in a sense [mn] 

134.83 135.70 A: yeah 

136.91 140.12 A: yeah and it it's just something else it's uh
