72.92 84.50 B: wow i have two dogs they're my sons so [mn] i don't know i just think that there's a lot of pet lovers out there it seems like the animals should have a special day since we you know some people don't really know when their birthday is if they've found them [mn] 

85.40 86.70 A: oh that's true 

85.55 86.20 B: so

95.16 96.00 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

95.22 104.24 A: i don't i'm not very celebratory in any manner there was a talk like a pirate day that was the best day ever you got to go around and talk like a pirate for a whole day 

103.46 105.52 B: [laughter] 

104.71 111.77 A: i guess if i was going to make a day i would call it victorian day where everybody has to be victorian for a day 'cause that's my 

111.22 112.61 B: what would they wear 

113.31 116.78 A: oh victorian clothing victorian and edwardian 

116.50 117.77 B: [mn] oh cool

117.70 120.15 A: yeah i got a i have a victorian dress 

119.71 122.49 B: i'd have to borrow something from you [laughter] [noise] 

121.87 125.23 A: it's a i got it off ebay it was a lot of money 

125.25 126.11 A: but ah 

126.31 132.77 A: i don't know i guess some people would have issues with that i think there ar- the average waist size was nineteen inches in the victorian era 

132.54 133.52 B: wow 

133.24 134.00 A: so 

133.56 138.81 B: i guess with the corset a- a- anybody could almost [laughter] get in one if they just about killed you maybe 

138.96 147.34 A: yeah there's some guy in currently in france who makes corsets and he wears them himself and his waist size is very very small 

146.47 148.25 B: [noise] wow is he gay 

148.46 152.66 A: i don't know it would be the kind of thing i would picture a gay man doing 

152.14 156.27 B: yeah yeah [noise] well if he's good at it you know what the heck 

153.87 155.06 A: (( but i don't know )) 

156.26 164.92 A: yes [mn] and a- we could do typ- you could do typically victorian things like have a victorian album or learn 

156.69 157.25 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

165.21 170.16 A: dances from that age and maybe you could um [mn] make victorian food 

170.23 172.82 A: i don't know i'm just i'm obsessed with it all 

172.44 173.92 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

173.28 174.23 A: i guess 

174.02 178.51 B: well sounds like you could plan a holiday like that real well since you know a lot about it 

177.95 181.88 A: oh yes everybody would just roll their eyes at me and go beth you are crazy 

181.87 184.51 B: [laughter] well gotta have some fun in life right [mn] 

181.99 183.50 A: (( and i'd say i know )) 

184.07 186.90 A: yes well we can all adopt english accents 

186.34 187.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

187.09 189.50 A: since the victorian era took place in england 

188.40 192.96 B: (( [mn] but of course [laughter] [noise] i lived in england )) 

191.99 193.07 A: oh did you 

193.30 195.43 A: i'm um going there this summer to study 

195.96 196.91 A: actually 

196.81 208.13 B: oh wow well it's too bad we don't have have a holiday for our pets i think because i love my dogs they have that unconditional love like jesus for you and most people unless it's your parents and you have a good relationship with them 

208.06 213.43 B: or your boyfriend or someone then most people don't have unconditional love for other people or for anything 

213.36 216.11 A: i would say i have unconditional love for one 

213.48 214.83 B: but themselves 

216.23 224.60 A: or two maybe other humans [mn] excluding my family maybe one other human being and that's my best friend who is in spain unfortunately but 

220.88 221.77 B: yeah 

225.20 226.66 A: oh oh oh well 

226.70 231.18 A: i i d- i'm not big on the whole boyfriend thing they're all losers 

232.05 233.61 A: at least mine was 

233.68 234.77 B: [mn] i'm sorry 

234.71 236.18 A: that that's okay 

235.53 249.87 B: sometimes it's depressing during holidays if you don't have a boyfriend you see all these couples walking around you know [laughter] it can be like oh my god but i've been with the same person for eight years so it's been okay for eight years but i remember before that it was kind of tacky sometimes [mn] sometimes i di- [noise] 

246.01 247.28 A: well that's good 

249.01 254.77 A: i had this i had one for six months but he decided he liked to fuck some 

254.80 256.62 A: blond germans 

256.95 257.99 A: better 

258.65 259.39 A: so 

258.86 261.09 B: well you don't want to be with a guy like that anyway 

261.64 263.18 A: no not really 

263.47 270.78 A: i would prefer one also that didn't sit at his compu- we sh- that's a holiday we should have a holiday for people like me 

270.80 280.24 A: and other single people who need decent human beings that are male who are not thirty who can be younger and be mature at the same time 

279.62 280.77 B: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

280.64 282.86 A: that would be particularly interesting 

281.10 282.45 B: that's a good idea 

283.17 289.72 B: [noise] [lipsmack] ah i think that's a good idea and those of us that have someone we can always trade 'em in for a newer more efficient model [laughter] just kidding 

288.83 290.07 A: there you go 

290.29 299.27 A: you know i- it would be um commercialized like a lot of holidays are like that swedish day i don't i think that's silly [mn] i also think 

293.36 293.93 B: (( [noise] )) 

299.66 304.12 A: this country should honor more holidays of other religions 

304.75 309.94 A: (( that would that's okay that's one thing that i w- would say about holidays that's what i think about )) 

309.71 315.28 B: [noise] [noise] like what one i think we honor so many of other religions already what do y- which ones are you s- referring to 

310.45 311.35 A: (( holidays )) 

314.60 320.05 A: there are a lot of hindu feasts and islamic feasts that nobody you don't get off work for them for example 

320.18 321.63 B: yeah that's true 

321.98 323.09 A: it's very 

322.30 328.70 B: i like having more days off anything for more days off not that i'd celebrate that but i'd enjoy the day off [laughter] 

325.29 326.23 A: (( yeah the )) 

327.82 330.86 A: europeans get like six weeks' holiday a year 

330.70 340.73 B: yeah but they don't have they have six weeks i used to live in europe they have six weeks' holiday but it's not because of their religion or because of any customs it's just because [mn] of the way their work schedule is 

339.27 340.03 A: so 

340.27 342.05 A: it's just the way it is 

342.28 352.88 B: so maybe we should just have a holiday just for a day off instead of to have you know these government holidays it seems like the government people get all the holidays off a lot of those holidays i don't get off it makes me mad 

351.63 353.85 A: maybe day off day 

354.13 359.54 B: makes me mad they get paid to be off and then i have to work and you don't get overtime and 

358.95 360.51 A: oh where do you work 

360.12 362.29 B: [mn] [mn] i work at an i._t. company 

362.44 363.12 B: (( [cough] )) 

363.12 363.93 A: oh 

363.25 364.10 B: (( so [mn] )) 

364.11 365.78 B: we don't get very many holidays they 

365.81 367.17 B: don't seem to honor 'em 

367.22 370.17 B: which is kinda [mn] depressing 'cause 

367.35 368.08 A: oh 

369.52 372.99 A: i'm on holiday it's spring break i guess that's fun 

371.64 373.51 B: yeah lucky you 

373.62 376.50 B: but then are you making any money when you're on holiday [noise] [mn] 

376.02 383.38 A: no i i work so much at school i don't have a job so no but i did work a lot at school this week 

383.26 384.43 B: mhm

387.98 390.15 A: that that's i don't get canada day off 

391.07 392.32 A: (( [laughter] i )) 

391.65 394.64 B: (( [laughter] well you could take it you )) 

393.71 395.02 A: (( know i should )) 

394.98 397.21 B: know you won't get paid for it though probably 

397.35 398.59 B: (( [mn] but )) 

397.95 402.04 A: no i i doubt that that's one good thing about holidays you get paid a lot more 

402.60 409.24 B: [mn] yeah i love holidays 'cause i don't know i just i like all the decorating at christmas and all the different 

409.21 418.04 B: little cherubic things i love angels so i like little cherub things and i like after christmas better because [mn] stuff's on sale then [laughter] 

417.24 420.05 A: yeah i enjoy i enjoy shopping for 

420.99 423.47 A: things after christmas 

421.77 422.73 B: (( but yeah i like )) 

422.85 432.99 B: i like buying gifts for people for holidays too like for christmas and stuff 'cause [mn] i used to be m- i guess more enjoy the receiving part but now i guess 'cause i've gotten older 

433.02 434.74 B: [mn] i enjoy giving more 

434.79 438.11 B: and trying to figure out something to get people sometimes is hard though 

438.23 446.08 B: [noise] if you know they have pretty much everything they need not that they're rockefellers or anything but maybe they just don't need another thing to have to dust off you know 

446.11 448.17 B: it can be frustrating sometimes 

448.22 455.01 B: [mn] it's too commercialized i guess a little bit i used to spend a lot more on christmas than what i do now [mn] now i don't 

453.87 456.96 A: i don't have money to spend on christmas should 

456.17 458.87 B: yeah this year was a bad year for me too so 

458.62 461.16 A: see my bank account you know that whole being a 

461.19 465.36 A: student thing i can give art work at christmas i'm at art major that's probably 

464.48 468.86 B: that's great it's probably better than anything you could buy him anyway it's something from the heart 

470.78 473.21 B: [mn] so you don't see what do you do at christmas where do you go 

473.66 475.48 B: do you go home for christmas or

517.20 518.71 A: oh well 

518.05 526.80 B: he must be smart if he knows how to make duck i don't think anyone knows how to cook duck except for these oriental restaurant people [laughter] and they make it pretty pretty crispy sometimes it's overcooked 

525.73 529.44 A: like it's usually i do a lot of the cooking have 

528.95 529.94 B: wow

553.44 561.35 A: if i got to just pick something to do for fun it wouldn't be make up a holiday to do something it would just be take a day off and do what i enjoy

567.45 575.81 B: [mn] ah i w- i like more ho- i would like more holidays so anything to have a day off i guess [laughter] i guess i really don't want to work [laughter] which i guess it's a cop out [mn] 

575.88 577.07 B: but 

576.24 579.47 A: nobody really wants to work everybody just wants to play 

579.70 581.60 B: yeah
