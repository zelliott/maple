11.09 13.79 A: you know anything about the subject today [laughter] [noise] 

12.53 20.89 B: [noise] [laughter] well um ah well a little bit um [mn] i think they should um disarm ah um 

21.49 23.84 B: iraq but not at the price of ah 

24.37 26.54 B: i think war should be the last resort 

26.38 29.41 A: yeah i agree with you completely 

29.42 30.32 A: um 

31.51 35.82 A: i think a lot of different compan- countries should be disarmed also 

35.76 47.03 B: yeah mainly ah o- ah ah north korea they seem to be ah overlooking them i think they are more afraid of north korea than they are of ah iraq 

46.65 50.76 A: right they're not they're not leading everyone to believe that though [mn] 

50.19 51.91 B: (( mhm )) 

52.47 53.87 B: [lipsmack] so um 

54.29 59.37 B: i don't know i i just think we're in a very precarious situation here and i think that if he 

59.42 72.23 B: goes ahead on and attack iraq that he's gonna get more than what he ah he he bargains for i think he's gonna set off a chain of events that he's not just no one is gonna be able to stop 

65.68 66.67 A: yeah 

71.88 74.74 A: and if he's not ready for it yet and 

74.19 76.15 B: yeah

95.18 95.84 A: (( yeah )) 

98.20 98.98 A: [laughter] 

99.55 102.82 A: first time and they give you a tough topic oh my 

102.11 105.86 B: yeah and i you know i didn't expect for them to call today 

105.36 106.96 A: yeah i just 

106.73 108.54 B: you know so but ah 

107.08 109.91 A: uh huh you have to be ready all the time i guess 

109.49 111.03 B: oh i guess so 

111.50 113.30 B: so ah but um 

113.44 119.36 B: [mn] i do- i don't i don't know i mean you hate to go against the president of of the united states [lipsmack] 

118.52 121.27 A: right we're supposed to stay in behind him but 

120.34 130.80 B: but in this case i mean [mn] our lives are at stake too and so is the life of peoples' sons and daughters and so forth you know 

127.82 130.64 A: right lots of family members so 

130.85 137.02 B: and ah if if he if he's so interested in i always joke around with the kids and i'm not so sure 

136.95 148.62 B: that i'm really joking but if he really wants to fight with iraq why don't he be the first one to hit the ground over there so [laughter] you see so [laughter] uh huh he in such a hurry you know 

143.94 146.27 A: [laughter] that would be 

147.99 151.34 A: yeah like it's it's got to be done immediately 

148.65 155.93 B: you know it's pretty easy to sit back and give orders [mn] to tell someone else to go and put they life on the line 

155.68 159.16 A: right i think he's got to do a lot more convincing of people 

159.60 165.09 B: well he's he's pretty arrogant and he doesn't seem to ah really ah 

159.90 160.47 A: (( [mn] )) 

162.25 163.08 A: yeah 

164.64 166.75 A: but it doesn't seem like the rest of the c- [mn] 

167.68 170.19 A: the country is following him i mean 

169.80 171.95 B: no and he doesn't seem to care 

171.17 174.95 A: they don't seem to be jumping in and he wants to do it all himself so 

172.45 173.59 B: mhm 

174.22 179.96 B: yeah [mn] i mean he just seems to ah judging from ah some of his other 

180.02 185.34 B: ah statements that he's made ah he feels that he's the commander in chief and what he says go 

185.24 186.36 A: right 

185.78 192.00 B: you know so he he really is to me coming off no be- better or no worse than saddam hussein 

191.85 193.05 A: yep 

192.42 206.40 B: you know because he's he's not listening to the people that he was elected to ah serve and everyone is warning him including people within his own ranks that this is a mistake for him to ah continue down this road 

206.71 208.36 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

207.66 208.57 B: so 

208.68 211.14 B: [lipsmack] i don't know 

210.93 214.84 A: we'll see where it'll take us in the next couple of months [mn] 

215.19 224.06 B: if we have a couple of months they said ahah they said something about that ah the united states was probably going to go ahead on attack sometime next week 

215.74 218.22 A: everyone's been on yeah [laughter] 

224.56 227.26 B: and something about ah the moon 

225.02 225.81 A: (( yeah )) 

227.45 233.52 B: they have to do it before the moon ah loses light or something like that 

233.79 239.35 B: ah doesn't provide as much light if they don't go ahead on an attack now it'll be much more difficult 

239.52 240.87 B: for them to ah 

239.63 241.85 A: [mn] i hadn't read that wow 

240.91 243.15 B: (( yeah )) 

242.45 247.95 A: well why are we giving them notice [mn] like a week aren't sneak attacks supposed to be better [laughter] 

248.05 255.39 B: i don't i don't underst- i don't understand that i mean it seems like to me that they tell them everything that they're going to do 

248.97 249.86 A: (( i mean )) 

250.64 251.74 A: is there 

255.86 259.97 B: and i don't see you know i don't really understand this 

257.52 260.86 A: right i mean if we're really going in to do it 

260.29 263.01 B: because saddam has c._n._n. 

263.30 271.56 B: ah he watches a lot of the news channels so he he's aware of everything that's going on and it's just like they might as well just invite him 

271.59 275.42 B: ah to the white house and just tell him what their next move is i mean 

275.00 276.07 A: right 

275.46 283.58 B: they don't try to keep anything hid or or you know they just seem to be too open with it to me i don't know what's going on 

283.72 286.85 A: (( [laughter] you know more than i do [laughter] )) 

285.77 288.99 B: [laughter] it's ju- i know it's a mess 

288.88 289.94 A: yeah 

289.32 291.26 B: it's a mess and ah 

290.52 293.00 A: not a very good place to be right now 

292.51 299.66 B: [mn] no and then ah they said that ah with that north korea incident at first they had said that ah 

299.82 304.14 B: ah if north korea shoot shot out the missiles that 

304.19 312.79 B: ah it would strike california and ah hawaii well then they later ah went ahead on a release that no 

312.85 321.37 B: that not only were the missiles ah capable of striking california and hawaii but they would ah strike the entire united states 

321.42 323.33 A: so they really don't know [laughter] 

322.96 325.08 B: [lipsmack] i think they knew all along 

324.52 326.18 A: they knew all along huh 

325.52 332.44 B: yeah to me they they lie a little bit put out a little bit lie a little bit put out a little bit but they they know 

331.17 336.62 A: that's the problem they they let so much out that you wonder how much more they really do know 

336.37 347.02 B: i think they know a lot i think they know a lot and then we're just little peons just sitting here 'cause i mean what are we going to do we don't run a government 

336.84 337.57 A: yeah 

347.20 348.19 A: right 

347.53 349.63 B: and so you know it's just 

349.71 355.14 B: i don't know like i just said i i guess i'll just get up some canned goods and rice and 

355.13 358.44 A: that's right and that tape we're supposed to have [mn] 

359.24 361.14 A: we're all supposed to have duct tape 

361.35 370.46 B: [lipsmack] [lipsmack] oh i don't believe that's going to do any good i mean one doctor and that and that struck me as strange too that they showed that doctor 

363.54 364.30 A: [laughter] 

370.48 371.49 B: um 

371.61 380.38 B: he got on t._v. and he said and they only showed him once he said that ah duct tape and sheeting paper was not going to do any good 

380.16 382.25 A: i can't see where it would either 

381.70 382.99 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

382.72 383.91 A: (( like )) 

383.66 387.60 B: i mean you'd be um too- taken in before you even know what happened anyway 

385.32 390.35 A: i think it might make people feel more comfortable thinking maybe they have a chance but 

388.42 389.68 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

390.07 391.95 B: yeah and and and 

390.82 393.41 A: and to think they're prepared but i don't think 

392.12 398.08 B: he's telling everybody to get duct tape and all this kind of stuff and you know he's going to be up under the ground in his bunker 

397.70 398.72 A: oh yeah 

398.56 400.06 B: you know [lipsmack] 

399.52 403.47 A: yeah that'll be the first place before anything starts up where he'll be 

403.30 406.45 B: i wonder what happened to all the fallout shelters 

407.04 409.61 A: [mn] i haven't seen any of those signs 

407.53 411.17 B: 'cause i remember back there in my day i'm fifty fifty two 

411.36 417.27 B: and i remember back there in my day ah we used to have fallout shelters in the schools and 

416.26 419.71 A: right in all the school buildings in the basements and the p- 

417.40 418.88 B: mhm 

420.01 422.21 A: any government office yeah i 

420.09 425.10 B: post offices and mhm [lipsmack] but i haven't heard anything about that 

423.91 429.08 A: haven't seen any of those signs lately either they used to have the black and gold signs and [mn] 

425.52 427.70 B: mhm mhm 

428.42 429.72 B: mhm 

430.81 442.89 B: [mn] well i think we just in for a i think we in for a rocky road and it's a lot of uncertainty but as soon as he push that button [mn] he's gonna go off into something that he's not gonna be able to to get us out of 

441.99 444.26 A: and there won't be any stopping it probably [laughter] 

443.52 452.73 B: mhm and it's gon- it's not gonna only happen over there i feel like it's i feel like he's gonna set off a chain of events right here on our own soil 

452.49 453.69 A: mhm 

453.23 456.76 B: [lipsmack] and the thing about it is that you don't know where these people are 

457.01 462.33 B: and what they're capable well yeah you know what they're capable of but you don't know where they're at 

459.76 461.16 A: (( oh yeah )) 

462.14 464.01 A: right they could be anywhere 

462.65 471.10 B: you know they could be your next door neighbors your doctor your i mean you just don't know because they've come over here and they've set up you know lives 

469.68 474.60 A: that's right we've let everyone in for all these years and didn't check anything 

471.18 474.27 B: mhm mhm 

475.17 482.56 B: so it's just um and it's kinda you know you you don't know what's said to the kids although they seem to be taking it better than the adults [laughter] 

482.35 483.68 A: yeah 

483.43 485.18 B: you know but you were 

484.03 493.58 A: i think a lot of the kids are now are just thinking it's t._v. and it's happening somewhere else to someone else and kids don't seem to care as much about things in other places 

487.32 489.00 B: yeah 

493.19 498.48 B: yeah 'cause i know i i asked my uh grandchildren i said well do you all have any uh uh 

498.69 504.81 B: escape plans or do they talk to you all about anything possibly happening in school she said no 

504.92 507.37 B: [laughter] 

505.44 509.51 A: yeah i mean even fire drills and that are you know 

508.51 511.02 B: mhm 

510.14 519.38 A: just looked overlooked in school they all know it's the drill and they get out of class for a few minutes and they're back in they don't think about it could really happen sometime 

519.90 528.58 B: no and the type of people that that we're dealing with these people you can't threaten them or anything like that because they truly just don't [sigh] 

520.68 521.44 A: (( or )) 

528.11 529.82 A: they don't care about their life 

528.89 536.88 B: uh-uh they don't care about life itself they have no respect for life so you can't you know turn around and threaten them with that because they don't care 

531.04 531.90 A: right 

537.42 538.06 A: (( yeah )) 

537.48 541.22 B: so this here's just a very interesting uh catastrophe 

541.23 543.86 B: that we're come are approaching here 

541.47 542.25 A: (( yup )) 

545.48 547.39 A: one to go down in the history book 

547.35 554.87 B: [lipsmack] i think it's going to do more than go down in the history book i say i say i'm not even my birthday's in june i'm not even looking forward to it 

551.30 551.93 A: (( uh-huh )) 

554.55 557.24 A: yeah mine's in june too [laughter] 

556.84 559.21 B: it's just oh really [lipsmack] 

558.27 559.87 A: yeah the twenty seventh mm 

559.42 565.54 B: oh mine is june the fifth yeah i'm not even looking forward to it i mean it's just so 

564.64 565.98 A: (( if we're here [laughter] )) 

565.78 566.85 B: yeah 

566.89 568.00 B: and those 

567.10 570.23 A: it seems that you have to live your life day to day and 

569.39 570.91 B: yeah 

570.49 574.50 A: go on with things as normally as you can and 

576.23 578.10 A: [mn] i don't know what else you could do 

578.05 583.08 B: well you can't can't worry about it 'cause there's nothing that you can do about it you know 

581.43 585.71 A: right it's nothing one individual like us could prevent 

584.77 585.87 B: mhm 

585.78 586.47 A: (( um )) 

586.24 590.90 B: i mean you can if it'd make you feel better you probably could get out there and protest 

587.01 589.05 A: voicing your opinion [noise] 

590.95 596.72 B: and so forth but ah he even said he didn't care what they said no he said he didn't care 

592.62 595.16 A: i don't think that'd get you anywhere 

596.52 597.61 A: no 

596.85 599.90 B: he said he respect the fact that this is america and that they're
