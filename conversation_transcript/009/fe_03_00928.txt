11.62 12.93 A: hi [laughter] 

12.17 21.29 B: [laughter] did you see that they wanted us to talk about iraq and ah the [laughter] way the u._s. government is supposed to deal with iraq

25.24 26.67 A: [laughter] 

26.73 32.89 A: ah i guess we're supposed to talk for ten minutes on that particular subject do you have some opinions 

29.13 30.39 B: that's right 

32.75 44.70 B: [mn] well [sigh] i have some opinions ah i think that we need to follow what the u._n. said and try and give them a little more time h- how do you feel about that [mn] 

44.76 46.15 A: i'm very 

46.48 48.42 A: not very but i'm 

49.87 51.76 A: sort of opposed 

52.35 57.99 A: to the u._s. starting a war when someone hasn't actually started one with us 

57.53 59.31 B: yes i agree with you 

58.89 72.13 A: i don't know that necessarily giving him more time i'm not at all sure that giving him more time is going to do any good because i think he's very adept at hiding what he wants to hide 

71.54 72.54 B: right 

72.50 76.21 A: but yet again i don't want to start a war 

75.80 81.90 B: i agree with you completely you know when i was at my dentist the other day believe it or not or actually a couple of weeks ago 

81.76 93.03 B: the hygienist was talking to me and somehow i don't know how she started talking about it and she said that her nephew was going to be sent to kuwait he ha- he is in the reserves 

92.59 93.75 A: mhm 

93.04 100.14 B: and he's be- being sent out to kuwait and saying how and this is actually a little before all this talk got so strong 

99.93 114.63 B: and she was saying how nervous she was and how nervous he is and how it's not right now like going into a peacetime situation or a peacekeeping situation it's like really possibly going into full blown war 

103.50 104.69 A: mhm 

114.74 117.05 A: and what's going to happen 

114.78 115.56 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

117.91 122.11 A: if we win it we haven't won the last couple that we've gone into 

120.38 121.33 B: yeah 

122.38 131.24 A: even if we win it it's going to be years and years and we're not going to be making any friends over there not at all we're going to be making more enemies 

127.65 128.91 B: oh that's right 

130.49 136.64 B: that's right and the thing i'm so afraid of is that it's going to increase the terrorist actions don't you think so 

136.38 140.58 A: yes i'm afraid so and i'm just afraid that 

136.87 139.10 B: yeah me too me too 

140.84 141.87 A: (( ah )) 

143.13 145.97 A: what friends we do have 

145.60 146.89 B: mhm 

146.43 149.43 A: are only friends because 

149.58 150.88 A: they need to be 

150.49 151.16 B: (( yeah )) 

151.47 162.96 A: and we're going to make so many more enemies it will be the first time in history as far as i'm concerned that we actually started a war 

159.70 160.67 B: mhm 

162.36 163.85 B: (( [sigh] yeah [mn] yeah )) 

162.89 168.56 A: with no real provocation against us because there's been no proof 

169.06 170.11 A: that 

170.48 175.09 A: he had anything to do with nine eleven 

174.49 189.33 B: that's right thank you for your opinion 'cause i got to tell you that you're one of the only people that i've talked to that feels the same way i do and i appreciate that because so many people are talking the opposite way i [laughter] really feel that yes where's the provocation 

189.11 194.17 B: to cause this degree of reaction [laughter] right 

193.03 199.29 A: and the thing is i'm not a pacifist my husband's a re- my husband's a retired military officer 

195.65 197.29 B: (( no me either [laughter] )) 

198.46 201.27 B: oh good for him [laughter] 

199.32 203.22 A: [laughter] so it's just [mn] 

204.14 210.11 A: i think we need to have a really good reason to be on the attack 

207.91 208.76 B: right 

209.65 210.74 B: right 

211.05 215.38 A: i'd be firmly behind if we were attacked first 

214.84 217.47 B: of course absolutely 

215.84 219.83 A: and i'm firmly behind going after any of the terrorists 

219.09 220.92 B: absolutely i agree 

220.75 228.78 A: but i'm just afraid of starting a war i'm afraid of what's going to happen and my own personal opinion is 

229.13 231.19 A: that george bush 

232.02 233.57 A: is 

232.78 233.94 B: [sigh] 

234.33 236.84 A: traveling a path 

236.88 238.21 A: that is 

238.25 242.26 B: he can't turn back very easily from once he takes it do you know 

241.52 248.01 A: no but i- what i'm afraid is that he's sort of taken this path 

248.32 253.08 A: for personal reasons i don't mean 

250.13 250.93 B: oh 

251.79 252.58 B: or 

253.01 254.07 B: political 

254.84 265.59 A: uh maybe political in a way however politically it's not doing him a whole lot of good right now i don't think but i mean it was like he insulted my father 

259.83 261.23 B: [laughter] 

261.52 262.86 B: you may be right 

265.28 266.42 B: (( ah mhm )) 

265.65 274.57 A: he has said that ah my father was insulted i'm not going to take it and it's just gone on from there and there and there 

274.58 277.14 A: course i'm not a real friend of the bushes anyway 

276.94 278.29 B: yeah

350.84 355.74 A: yeah i'm trying to think of some other aspects of this that we could 

355.88 366.72 B: [laughter] [sigh] yeah well i j- i feel that ah well one thing that i would say is i feel very very sorry for the iraqi people because i think that they are stuck in a position 

366.63 372.64 B: mm so many of those people are so poor [laughter] and they've gotten just poorer [laughter] 

369.42 370.43 A: yeah 

371.79 375.46 A: but i don't think necessarily that we're going to help them 

373.85 374.69 B: (( ah )) 

375.15 377.75 B: oh no and that's so sad 

376.08 382.01 A: i think it's going to be much much worse either way they're going to be in bad shape 

378.60 379.54 B: yeah 

381.34 387.43 B: yeah i think so and i don't think it's going to do anything good for us really in the long run [sigh] 

382.78 384.39 A: i'm afraid so 

386.07 388.34 A: no i don't either 

387.70 389.09 B: yeah 

388.41 396.54 A: i i noticed our gasoline prices started going back up again in the last couple of days they'd gone down a little bit now they're back up how are they in connecticut 

390.69 391.83 B: (( [noise] [mn] oh )) 

391.85 392.63 B: my 

392.79 394.16 B: my god 

395.83 401.72 B: horrible what are your gas prices there around the dollar sixty seventy eighty [laughter] 

398.37 399.13 A: well 

400.92 408.50 A: yeah well ah this past week it had gone down to about one sixty seven one sixty eight 

407.87 409.22 B: yeah 

408.62 414.79 A: and ah coming home this evening i saw it was up to one seventy two three four 

413.76 417.79 B: [sigh] yeah that's about what it is here which is pretty awful 

415.99 419.10 A: yeah and and just gone like that in a day or two 

418.63 420.80 B: yeah [laughter] yeah isn't that terrible 

420.34 428.30 A: yeah but it had been up in the mid hundr- dollar seventies then it went down a little bit and now it's back up again 

424.80 425.74 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

426.54 427.52 B: yes 

427.62 432.48 B: it actually got down to the dollar fifties here and then it went back up again yeah 

431.80 435.47 A: and the stock market of course is not doing anything 

434.89 442.42 B: [laughter] oh we got out of the stock market ah the well actually [laughter] you know after nine eleven actually when 

439.18 440.15 A: [laughter] 

441.73 449.31 A: yeah well we couldn't because that's our retirement i think but i'm very conservative and and we try to 

444.64 446.45 B: oh my goodness 

449.94 451.81 A: ah ah we're trying to ride it out 

451.31 454.99 B: yeah and i hope it does take a good turn for you because as 

454.16 459.40 A: well in the long term but of course we- we're old enough that the long term [laughter] might not be long enough 

458.09 459.03 B: (( you [laughter] )) 

459.32 463.10 B: (( ah no [laughter] no )) 

460.73 462.40 A: yeah so 

462.83 464.28 A: (( but ah )) 

465.10 467.76 A: ah well you know 

465.81 473.81 B: hopefully it it will though it will turn better i think this is just a bad patch that we've all got to get through as a country and as people you know 

473.76 476.39 A: that's right and i think 

476.85 481.19 A: as far as this country is concerned and the people in it we've got 

483.04 484.62 A: we're really 

486.07 487.82 A: very patriotic 

487.54 488.73 B: oh yeah 

488.12 490.53 A: we're very um 

489.96 495.47 B: i think as a whole more than anybody even realized right i mean more than we all realized 

493.45 494.53 A: right 

494.78 504.68 A: right ah i think certain things made us sit up and say hey isn't it about time we started thinking in that direction again instead of being so complacent 

501.38 502.97 B: that's right yeah 

504.15 505.02 B: right 

505.15 509.13 A: ah it just happens that because 

509.58 513.92 A: you know when you're successful when you have something 

513.51 514.41 B: mhm 

515.01 517.09 A: all of the have nots 

517.10 518.13 A: hate you 

517.96 519.56 B: (( [laughter] yeah that's )) 

518.74 521.31 A: and americans hate to be hated 

520.71 526.51 B: yeah that's true yeah and don't understand it i think you know i think that when people come 

524.73 530.74 A: no they we don't understand why we're hated but yet again it's a fact 

527.14 528.64 B: right right 

530.06 538.48 B: but it and it's a natural reaction unfortunately it really is from people who don't have right right exactly exactly 

533.88 537.56 A: yes it is it's human nature yeah 

537.70 539.45 A: right so 

538.55 542.30 B: but it's difficult for u- for us to deal with as a country i think 

542.14 544.82 A: yeah it is it really is 

542.50 543.50 B: (( you know [sigh] )) 

545.19 546.82 A: so i don't know 

546.74 550.68 B: [laughter] so how's the weather down there in florida 

547.27 548.76 A: [laughter] 

550.27 554.00 A: it's great right now in fact it's up in the ah

563.62 565.25 B: (( [sigh] yes )) 

571.23 572.47 B: yeah 

573.22 575.46 A: we don't want to have any more 

575.55 579.73 A: new england or mid western winters believe me [laughter] 

577.63 583.44 B: [laughter] we actually wondered up here how you [mn] you all had weathered 

583.25 595.13 B: that we had that very bad storm a few weeks ago when it came from the south and i know there was a lot of ah damage in the south from the cold and i was wondering how how it turned out down there [noise] 

586.02 586.94 A: right 

593.45 594.12 A: it 

594.39 596.07 A: it didn't hurt
