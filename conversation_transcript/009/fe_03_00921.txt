0.38 2.81 B: hello there my name's carl and you are 

2.62 4.05 A: i'm lisa 

3.89 5.00 B: (( how are you doing )) 

5.17 7.12 A: i'm doing all right 

6.46 9.48 B: uh first time i've participated in this so it's kinda weird 

9.22 10.76 A: okay me too [noise] 

11.79 12.77 B: so 

11.97 17.90 A: so we're supposed to be talking about this iraq thing uh what's your general take [noise] 

14.93 16.76 B: yeah 

17.83 20.40 B: you know what i keep going back and forth 

20.83 21.87 B: um 

22.60 27.94 B: personally i think bush is pushing to f- fast but um 

28.08 30.11 B: saddam isn't playing the game right either 

30.62 32.07 B: [noise] how about you [sigh] 

32.70 41.26 A: well i said at nine eleven when it first happened that saddam had his hand in it i always believed that he did [noise] um as far as [noise] 

41.14 48.59 A: what he has over there and what he's hiding you know i listened to colin powell and i believe what he reported was accurate 

48.87 52.93 A: [mn] um but then again i try to think about how 

53.50 58.28 A: they might view us because we are somewhat arrogant 

55.06 56.02 B: mhm 

58.35 69.15 A: um towards the rest of the world however i don't know that we should wait and see whether or not he's going to do it [noise] and i think for the safety of everyone um 

69.67 72.33 A: [lipsmack] nuclear weapons need to be 

72.74 75.47 A: policed unfortunately um 

74.72 75.35 B: (( yep )) 

76.66 78.86 B: i i would agree with you there and ah 

79.01 82.48 B: also the ah chemical and biological ah 

81.62 82.70 A: (( [mn] yes )) 

82.76 86.54 B: and that's the problem is i is i think our government has taken a wr- a 

87.07 91.09 B: a ah how's that they don't enough foreign policy experience 

91.36 96.45 B: they don't understand how the europeans think and 

93.50 94.61 A: mhm 

96.50 99.21 B: i think instead of constantly pointing it to 

99.34 100.38 B: um 

100.57 102.79 B: you know we all know saddam is playing a game 

102.86 103.82 A: right 

102.88 107.41 B: and i saw colin powell's speech yesterday too and i the whole a- as much as i could watch 

107.84 109.11 B: (( and ah )) 

109.29 114.37 B: i i do think yeah he's hiding them he's he definitely has them where he's hiding them is the question mark 

114.34 115.56 A: mhm 

115.39 119.85 B: the europeans unfortunately are are you f- are you familiar with what ah 

119.94 123.86 B: prime minister chamberlain did with ah nazis before world war two 

123.76 124.64 A: no 

124.35 129.73 B: oh [mn] there was a policy of [sigh] ah of co-operation 

129.94 144.01 B: adolf hitler took over part of poland and said oh i'm just re- recapturing part of germany not a problem and chamberlain said oh yeah no problem and of course that led to world war two getting out of hand and i think the europeans are being foolish 

140.33 141.40 A: mhm 

143.94 148.44 B: in thinking that this inspection is actually going to yield results 

148.56 149.64 A: mhm 

149.30 154.69 B: because of the way that they're going about it if they put a firm deadline and said this is absolutely the deadline 

151.50 152.42 A: right 

155.46 159.20 B: they might get results but saddam is playing his game 

158.75 160.25 A: (( mhm mm )) 

159.95 162.33 B: and they're playing it with him unfortunately 

162.13 166.87 A: yeah so now it has come to mind i did think about world war two and think about 

167.03 177.73 A: how a lot of people turned the other cheek so to speak or look the other way and things really got out of hand and [mn] um there are people over there suffering even right now 

169.06 170.87 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

177.28 179.15 B: oh yeah 

178.10 180.99 A: and so you know i guess [mn] 

181.36 185.97 A: somebody has to unfortunately be the bad guy or be the policeman 

186.00 191.06 A: and it looks like it's fallen to us um [lipsmack] i would like to see other 

191.35 197.73 A: countries take a more active role especially those that are closer to him because they're in a greater danger really than we are 

197.94 200.52 A: but they don't seem to recognize it 

198.00 198.82 B: (( mhm right )) 

200.48 209.23 B: you're absolutely right an- an- and the ah arabic neighbors to iraq who are on his side have forgotten he's attacked other arab countries 

209.17 210.23 A: mhm 

209.87 212.76 B: in the past in fact he's attacked two of his neighbors 

210.87 212.14 A: right 

212.74 213.86 A: mhm 

213.22 215.61 B: trying to invade them and successfully invaded one 

215.67 220.80 B: so yeah disarmament i think is necess- necessary the problem occurred earlier on though when bush 

221.13 226.03 B: initially talked about regime change before he talked about disarmament and that was a 

223.45 224.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

226.64 229.40 B: ah a gaffe an error in his part 

229.60 230.44 A: mhm 

230.66 236.00 B: because the europeans and certainly i think a lot of ah arab states 

236.40 245.49 B: feel this is strictly about a ah regime change [noise] and not disarmament because that's what that's the foot he led with so 

239.31 240.20 A: (( mm )) 

241.15 243.35 A: mm mhm mhm 

243.91 245.76 A: mhm mhm 

246.91 250.38 B: but as for the central question on here i do think we need to [mn] do something [laughter] 

247.28 247.88 A: (( [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

251.03 263.90 A: and i guess you know i can think back you think back to the sixties and you [noise] think about the things that our government was involved in that we do know about and the things that happened as far as assassinations that 

264.30 266.57 A: we suspect um 

266.77 276.17 A: [lipsmack] a- but then again y- you think well if we have all this technology to see all of this and know all of this why can't we send somebody in there and just take him out 

276.69 282.94 A: if they can come over here and blow up four thousand two thousand however many thousands of people they blew up in the world trade center 

282.45 284.29 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

283.70 285.27 A: um [sigh] 

285.86 288.44 A: so i don't know i don't know um 

288.45 291.93 A: a lot of people are going to die if something's not done quickly 

291.68 300.27 B: yep um o- on the issue of you know why don't we send somebody in directly i thought about that in the first gulf war and 

300.42 303.16 B: i think it has something to do with 

303.58 311.91 B: the leadership not the leadership of any country not liking the idea of sanctioning removing by that manner the leaders of other countries 

310.63 311.83 A: mhm 

311.84 312.79 A: right 

312.40 313.46 B: because 

314.09 321.45 B: about as easily as we could get somebody over there to get saddam in fact possibly more easily they could get somebody over here to get bush 

317.28 318.42 A: mhm 

321.49 323.13 A: i see mhm 

322.39 325.28 B: and that's why i think they don't want to go 

325.57 328.10 B: ah down that path [laughter] because 

327.49 328.91 A: mhm 

328.54 330.91 B: that's one way they don't have a ah 

330.97 333.65 B: military super- superiority you know [laughter] 

333.38 335.60 A: [noise] i see yeah yeah 

334.34 335.51 B: (( [noise] you know )) 

335.97 340.39 B: an- an- and again demonstrated by the fact that nineteen people were able to take out so much 

340.23 341.72 A: yes yes 

342.24 343.16 A: (( that's true )) 

343.00 345.41 B: it's all hard questions [laughter] 

345.13 346.13 A: (( [laughter] )) 

346.28 348.06 A: how long have we been talking now 

347.74 350.25 B: i don't know it seems like an hour doesn't it 

349.87 351.80 A: [laughter] 

351.08 353.17 B: are we supposed to time or are they gonna come in 

353.29 361.72 A: um i heard that they will actually cut in on us if we go over but if we hang up before the ten minutes is over we don't get paid so 

360.98 364.07 B: oh then i'll just keep jabbering you know what i'm 

362.02 364.06 A: [laughter] 

364.56 377.01 B: actually you know what we've been talking for about seven minutes because my cl- my phone i had to take a look has a little counter so it took me about a minute to get connected so oh we have probably two three minutes left 

369.97 371.20 A: (( uh huh )) 

373.40 374.49 A: okay 

376.77 381.40 A: [mn] okay um what else can we talk about concerning iraq [laughter] 

380.50 381.92 B: (( [sigh] ah )) 

382.27 384.65 B: well actually we could talk about the timing 

384.76 386.50 B: if we think was going to war 

386.44 387.38 A: yeah 

386.79 395.26 B: my brother in law had an interesting point and that is that the u._s. will probably move during a new moon when there's no moon out 

388.74 389.87 A: mhm 

394.36 395.72 A: i see yeah 

395.64 401.57 B: and looking at that i would say that somewhere around april first is the strike date 

401.62 403.36 A: oh i see mm 

403.23 405.70 B: 'cause i as soon as i heard powell yesterday i mean i 

406.08 408.25 B: powell pretty much clearly said we're going in 

408.18 409.74 A: (( mhm mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

409.79 415.51 B: and i looked at the calendar and i'm like mm we're about three days past the new moon this time so 

416.97 421.05 B: i'm sus- judging that they're going to wait for the next one to come around 

420.08 421.08 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

422.12 423.68 B: is that yours or mine 

423.55 425.01 A: no that's me 

424.76 426.23 B: oh okay no problem 

427.73 432.52 A: [lipsmack] well i guess i wonder too with this guy that they just caught 

433.08 434.82 B: [laughter] ooh interesting 

435.26 436.37 A: that uh 

435.26 436.19 B: yeah 

436.62 442.11 A: i i wonder if he's going to give up any information concerning iraq's involvement 

442.16 446.38 B: um you know i've a feeling he's going to whether whether or not he thinks he's going to 

447.27 448.38 B: because 

447.49 448.28 A: (( mm )) 

449.22 453.84 B: these people won't keep their mouth completely shut they'll brag about something 

451.85 453.19 A: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

453.26 454.78 A: i see mhm 

454.86 458.46 B: and that's an interesting point they might want to give a little time to sweat this guy 

458.33 459.48 A: mhm 

459.37 465.87 B: find out something about i- if not necessarily the sleeper cells themselves but they also captured a lot of intelligence with this guy 

463.24 464.27 A: mhm 

465.81 467.12 A: mhm 

466.09 467.83 B: they captured a lot of material 

467.82 469.16 A: mhm 

468.76 471.10 B: so they may want to sift through that material 

471.49 479.45 B: get a clue if not who is gonna be doing something what's gonna happen what's the tar- what are the targets this next time around 

476.30 477.43 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

478.40 480.78 A: mhm mhm 

479.86 485.14 B: so that might be something that they might be well worth waiting a few weeks on 

482.75 483.91 A: (( they might try )) 

485.19 491.45 A: [mn] now i had heard some things about saddam and all these doubles he supposedly has [noise] 

490.59 491.93 B: mhm 

491.96 495.83 A: do you think we know which ones are the doubles and which one is really saddam 

496.82 502.24 B: um i have a feeling we know we're better at knowing it than they think we are 

502.26 503.72 A: (( ah ahah )) 

503.28 504.95 B: you know i i 

505.96 514.88 B: in fact if i i- if i put any cr- credence on our military intelligence we're probably a lot better than they think we are because even though they're gonna send out doubles 

514.91 516.01 A: mhm 

515.01 520.49 B: i'm also willing to bet that there's going to be two more cars in the entourage that go with the real saddam 

520.53 521.99 A: (( mm mm )) 

520.80 531.79 B: and the car and the double they're not that smart you know not not meaning to belittle 'em that much but i don't think they figured that one out but that's good you know i have never thought about that till now when you've brought it up oh god 

523.08 524.33 A: mhm 

528.03 528.81 A: (( hm )) 

532.58 540.69 A: well you know i was thinking about the fact that because right now what's going on in the news if they're telling all this information it's psychological warfare 

540.64 542.90 B: yeah yeah 

542.38 546.94 A: but then you wonder what's the real truth [laughter] 

546.00 546.87 B: (( mm )) 

546.97 549.33 B: to go off topic on that issue 

549.47 552.36 B: um you're familiar with the iran contra affair right 

552.16 552.93 A: yes 

553.72 565.30 B: i used to live in madison wisconsin and during the eighties there was talk about this who- essentially the iran contra thing the militant press the the left wing stuff it was talking about all of that [mn] 

565.55 566.11 A: (( [noise] )) 

566.09 574.02 B: and i said oh come on this is outrageous yeah our government has a secret thing to funnel arms to iran or iraq or whatever and then 

573.42 577.08 A: so th- the news was out but nobody believed it 

576.46 579.36 B: yeah 'cause it was so outrageous 

577.33 579.26 A: [laughter] 

579.62 581.75 A: [laughter] 

580.37 585.13 B: when iraq contra broke i'd already knew the story but i didn't believe it [laughter] 

582.97 585.61 A: [laughter] 

587.81 594.77 B: i i kid you not i mean i had heard al- most of the details especially the parts involving the actual smuggling in south america 

594.62 595.91 A: oh my goodness 

596.12 599.89 B: [noise] and then i hear it and i'm like oh my god those crazies were right 

598.93 599.74 A: [laughter]
