26.77 30.54 B: so we are to talk about bio-terrorism i know that 

30.28 36.51 A: okay well i the only really thing that i think that we can do about it is just invade and get all of their 

37.13 40.67 A: get as many as their chemical weapons as we possibly can 

41.04 42.78 B: so you are all in favor of uh of 

42.94 43.89 B: invading iraq 

44.53 45.28 A: yes i am 

45.30 46.18 B: you are okay 

46.02 46.35 A: yeah 

47.49 51.52 B: i'm sort of uh i i'm i think that's going to ultimately the only way to uh uh 

51.73 54.91 B: uh handle this thing i started to use the word attack but 

53.57 53.97 A: yup 

55.34 55.83 B: um 

56.79 59.12 B: i'd love to think that it could be done in a more peaceful way 

59.86 60.36 A: yeah 

60.68 61.17 B: um 

63.68 69.21 B: you know it doesn't seem to me i i don't think that the government is telling us everything that they know but 

69.39 71.78 B: perhaps we don't need to know 

71.10 80.03 A: yeah they um see i think the same thing i don't i i think there's is a lot more that the united states you know civilians could know 

80.08 80.45 B: mhm 

80.67 83.98 A: and they just don't want us to know because they want 

84.72 90.71 A: to you know have the half the people wanting us to go to war and the other half no wanting to go to war and 

92.08 92.66 B: well in 

92.13 100.43 A: i t- i think they like to keep everything strictly to where uh when somebody comes up for the next election they are going to have a good campaign 

100.67 100.96 B: right 

102.04 102.86 A: so 

102.25 103.11 B: a lot of politics 

103.95 104.33 A: yup 

104.19 113.21 B: well and my and my um my concern is that you know the united nations is so divided and france is so not with us and you know that this is going to turn in to 

113.33 113.71 B: um 

113.82 115.56 B: we're we're it's all going to be on our shoulders 

116.08 116.42 A: yup 

116.37 117.59 B: and um that concerns me 

118.13 119.81 B: i'd like to think that we are allied or not 

120.13 120.55 B: and 

120.67 121.38 B: since we are not 

122.07 122.58 B: why not 

122.78 123.17 B: you know 

123.49 124.30 A: yeah 

124.15 124.63 B: um 

124.43 124.82 A: and 

125.04 127.96 A: and another thing i i just i think that 

128.43 136.02 A: one of these times we are going to pick on a country that you know i mean i know we are the strongest country in the world but i mean that's 

136.33 140.23 A: i mean there's people out there that have a lot more smarts than the u._s. does 

140.21 140.72 B: mhm 

141.27 150.12 A: and i think that one of these times we are going to pick on the wrong country and they are going to get us and they are going to get us good 

141.32 141.59 B: hm 

146.62 148.09 B: right 

149.22 150.23 B: mhm 

150.86 154.50 B: and then i wonder about the repercussions on oil i mean we are already feeling the price at the pump 

155.75 156.94 B: you know we invade iraq 

156.43 156.79 A: i 

157.27 157.91 B: what's (( up )) 

157.42 158.82 A: i truthfully think that 

159.15 160.71 A: when we were doing good 

160.97 164.09 A: a long time ago that they should of bought some kind of oil company 

164.49 165.02 B: exactly 

165.84 166.11 B: yup 

165.95 169.46 A: and i mean to this day the united states till doesn't know more 

169.80 170.21 B: right 

170.91 177.57 A: and i i think that if they would go ahead and buy an oil company we wouldn't have to rely on all these other 

177.79 180.40 A: you know all these other countries and 

180.89 184.64 A: they would keep americans happy -cause their gas bills would stay down 

184.89 185.30 A: and 

185.43 186.01 A: it would just 

186.79 190.21 A: it amazes me how we are supposed to be the richest country in the world 

190.43 192.39 A: and we can't buy an oil company 

192.40 194.60 B: well it also amazes me that um 

194.91 197.76 B: spend a lot of time in long beach california and i looked out of 

197.89 200.86 B: the hotel window that i was working on for three months 

201.01 201.67 B: and 

201.85 202.63 B: uh got 

202.82 203.11 B: (( )) 

203.28 204.43 B: catalina island and what if 

204.61 209.36 B: there is oil being drilled everywhere you know and not to mention oklahoma we've got oil in this country 

209.58 210.06 A: mhm 

210.36 217.12 B: and i don't know why we're not taking care of our own with what we have here and i guess we are to a but i don't quite get it 

217.64 219.42 B: i'd like to say i do but 

217.95 218.47 A: yeah 

219.54 221.25 B: we need to be a little more self sufficient 

221.67 222.78 B: unless defend it 

222.04 222.85 A: exactly 

222.94 223.22 B: yup 

224.63 225.31 A: exactly 

224.75 228.08 B: so as far as saddam hussein and bio-terrorism i 

228.66 232.63 B: you know yeah he needs to get out of there but i just wish that we could do this in a 

232.78 233.95 B: a little more peaceful manner 

234.43 242.64 A: yeah i i think i think right now the best our best bet is going to be just go ahead and just catch them by surprise and sneak in there and 

243.11 247.09 A: just uh gather up as many chemical weapons as we possibly can from -em 

247.18 247.52 B: right 

247.97 253.87 B: the other thing too that i saw a guy on the today show this morning he wrote a book um to try and delay our fears about 

254.05 257.92 B: you know the duct tape and plastic and all this junk and have safe rooms and what 

258.46 258.81 A: uh-huh 

258.58 258.85 B: (( )) 

259.10 259.70 B: s- i- 

259.84 263.24 B: i mean he wrote a book so i guess he knows what he is doing but everybody that writes doesn't 

263.83 268.44 B: i- you know he was saying that chemical warfare 

264.44 265.51 A: yeah 

269.00 272.49 B: doesn't hold up in windy days it doesn't hold up on 

272.83 274.11 B: cold days hot days 

274.37 275.80 B: you know environments change 

276.11 278.76 B: these things aren't going to permeate the walls and make us all die 

279.25 279.70 A: yeah 

279.58 282.02 B: further more he said things like um 

282.39 287.38 B: you know these these gases are colorless odor less whatever look for people that are like throwing up 

287.62 289.01 B: sneezing watery eyes 

289.33 291.05 B: you'll know that something is funny 

291.44 293.08 B: and go take go take cover 

291.60 292.03 A: yeah 

293.45 295.02 B: but you don't have to hold up in your house 

295.64 296.20 B: and um 

296.34 297.57 B: live behind plastic 

298.16 304.30 B: you know and he and then he went on to do statistics and said even i- you know all out 

299.07 299.72 A: yeah 

304.73 308.06 B: these nerve gases and stuff and like one out of twelve people die 

308.62 309.05 A: uh-huh 

308.94 309.87 B: it's not that 

310.29 310.88 B: i mean 

311.16 312.94 B: i'm scared and i'm concerned 

313.54 316.42 B: of course i am but i'm i don't want to catch the flu either 

316.27 316.86 A: yeah 

316.81 318.09 B: you know 

317.72 319.41 A: yeah i know and you know 

319.96 321.22 A: i i think 

321.47 326.44 A: truthfully i can't stand to be inside so i i think if it came down to it 
327.09 332.74 A: i i would rather die than sit inside my house trapped behind a sheet of plastic 

332.43 337.37 B: well based on what he said you'd be better off because it's not going anywhere as long as it is out in en- in the element 

335.95 336.26 A: yeah 

337.80 338.26 A: yeah 

338.12 339.29 B: he said where it can 

339.93 343.44 B: effect us the most is um in if these people are serious 

344.23 348.05 B: -h we we don't have duct tape and plastic they are getting us in enclosed stadiums 

348.49 349.92 B: subways things like that where 

350.03 350.32 B: you 

350.05 350.48 A: yeah 

350.52 351.65 B: you can't get out anyway 

352.08 357.62 A: yeah where it's it's just going to wipe out a large number and there's nothing they can do about it period 

352.94 353.54 B: (( )) 

357.08 357.36 B: (( )) 

357.72 358.41 B: exactly 

358.62 359.14 B: basically 

358.88 359.22 A: so 

359.34 361.52 B: get over it but don't um live your life 

361.89 365.55 B: behind um plastic sheets 

363.73 364.84 A: yeah 

365.06 368.59 A: and so i d- i don't even think i could last an hour behind it 

368.50 369.61 B: uh ha 

369.46 377.94 A: uh i all my life i've been a real outside person and if someone is going to take that away from me well then i guess they are going to have to take it from me -cause i'm going to stay outside 

377.84 378.96 B: mhm mhm hm 

378.66 379.19 A: so 

379.81 380.53 B: hm

402.63 404.50 B: i don't either that i am new to this um 

405.48 407.52 B: any other thoughts on bio-terrorism 

410.36 411.41 A: not right off hand 

414.06 415.47 B: but you are in favor of going to war 

416.50 416.94 A: yeah 

417.12 417.47 B: uh-huh 

417.86 419.84 B: i think that is probably what it is going to take and i think that 

420.09 421.22 B: it's already been decided 

421.40 422.35 B: we just haven't been told 

422.92 428.43 A: yeah i i think it's i think everything is already in progress and their going to tell us 

428.63 431.63 A: you know after they have already invaded and 

432.78 437.29 A: uh (( )) i mean it's all out war so i mean there is nothing really america can say about it 

437.49 437.83 B: right

445.31 445.63 B: yeah 

446.39 447.15 A: i mean 

448.55 450.68 A: i would like to think that it's not but 

450.91 452.11 A: you know and then again 

452.91 456.37 A: if it is it hey it is and i mean there is nothing we can do to stop it 

456.12 456.50 B: right 

457.39 457.80 B: i just 

457.62 458.13 A: i mean 

459.25 464.43 A: anyhow they they rely on us to select a president and everything 

464.56 467.13 A: but they don't rely on us to 

467.22 468.85 A: decide whether we go to war or not 

468.99 469.29 B: right 

469.65 471.97 A: i mean it's our people that we are sending over there
