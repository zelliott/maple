112.96 114.00 A: what were you saying 

114.51 116.45 B: i said that i think it would be 

116.67 117.15 B: um 

117.61 120.42 B: so- a relationship that you don't have to work at 

122.96 125.40 A: i wo- a relationship that you don't have to work at 

125.71 127.63 B: right a relationship like 

129.07 129.80 A: that's kind of got 

129.07 131.96 B: i compare it to like family members 

132.10 132.54 A: uh-huh 

132.16 134.63 B: like people who who love you 

135.51 140.71 B: and that doesn't that me you know it doesn't me that they always agree with you 

140.92 141.31 A: uh-huh 

141.10 141.69 B: but 

141.92 142.41 B: it's 

143.28 144.37 B: understood 

145.80 149.87 B: there's you know they're always going to be there you know that they're always going to love you 

148.97 149.42 A: uh-huh 

150.38 150.81 A: yeah 

150.79 151.37 B: and 

151.52 152.63 B: it's not hard 

152.91 153.40 B: i mean 

154.30 158.31 B: i'm not saying it's not perfect but just seems like that 

158.77 159.28 B: ah 

160.04 161.67 B: you know to me life's to short 

163.16 164.25 B: to spend 

164.96 166.08 B: everyday 

166.26 167.15 B: trying to 

167.88 170.13 B: be someone you're not to please 

170.71 171.43 B: your partner 

171.79 172.25 A: right 

172.53 173.04 A: yeah 

173.27 178.91 A: i i feel in someone ways very similar and perhaps in other way 

179.38 181.92 A: um a little differently i i feel that 

182.88 183.44 A: um 

185.64 187.29 A: the partner should be 

188.19 191.71 A: well the relationship in general i i expect to be 

192.51 192.96 A: ah 

193.95 196.82 A: to require work to be able to maintain it 

197.63 198.14 A: um 

198.85 201.59 A: for for any relationship to be satisfying 

202.53 205.44 A: but at that same time i i feel like um 

205.88 206.98 A: there's a couple of 

207.24 208.50 A: expectations that 

209.10 210.30 A: things that you would 

210.85 216.30 A: need for a relationship to be success and one that you mentioned was commitment 

216.43 217.16 A: to 

217.66 218.15 A: um 

218.31 221.17 A: whoever the person is and i think that 

222.90 223.53 A: that ah 

223.96 224.91 A: when we know that 

225.16 227.03 A: our partner's committed to us 

227.17 227.50 A: that 

228.14 231.31 A: we can be ourself and we don't have to worry about 

231.41 234.64 A: trying to be someone that's going to please them 

235.12 246.15 A: and that they're they're going to accept us for who we are if if they are committed to stay with us through thick and thin you know what if what if i'm going through a really rough time right now and it's difficult for my wife well 

247.11 251.91 A: i would hope that she would stay in the relationship and stay committed 

253.04 253.45 A: um 

254.45 255.20 A: even though 

255.53 260.52 A: i'm having a hard and that she would accept me for for who i am and what i'm going through and just 

260.69 264.36 A: trust and hope that you know whatever it is 

265.17 270.48 A: that that there is a light at the end of the tunnel so it's probably pretty similar to what you were saying 

271.27 272.42 B: yeah i just 

271.33 272.02 A: but maybe 

272.63 274.07 B: i'm i am just 

274.37 275.59 B: just got divorced just 

276.23 281.44 B: i moved two years ago and i just got divorced this week then i'm officially divorced and 

276.25 277.07 A: just barely 

279.38 279.76 A: (( )) 

281.83 283.36 A: so you separated two years ago 

281.90 282.67 B: so 

282.77 283.08 B: i've 

284.25 286.10 B: i moved out two years ago 

285.44 285.90 A: uh-huh 

286.31 288.47 B: and took us two years to get the divorce 

288.39 288.74 A: yeah 

288.73 289.38 B: because of 

289.76 290.43 B: legal 

290.82 291.57 B: wranglings 

291.97 292.35 A: right 

292.53 293.35 B: and so 

293.81 295.96 B: coming out of that marriage 

296.77 297.26 B: that 

298.03 301.33 B: you know i came out of it thinking that the only 

301.68 305.28 B: way i would get involved in a relationship with someone else 

305.74 307.99 B: again is if that person 

308.75 309.36 B: um 

310.75 312.89 B: if they would be a companion to me 

313.01 314.96 B: be someone that i could be myself with 

313.10 313.54 A: (( )) 

315.30 315.72 A: right 

316.09 316.89 B: and 

317.61 318.29 B: um 

318.38 319.90 B: except me for who i am 

320.16 320.53 A: right 

320.92 321.47 B: and 

321.91 324.54 B: and my previous relationship although 

325.73 331.94 B: he claimed to be committed and he claimed to want to say with me forever even after our separation 

332.34 332.79 A: uh-huh 

332.94 333.71 B: he still 

334.13 338.30 B: continued to tell me he also thought i was a a liar and a cheat 

338.54 339.08 A: uh-huh 

338.88 339.38 B: and 

342.27 344.10 B: from my point of view 

344.78 347.52 B: i don't want someone who is going to stay with me forever 

348.11 349.09 B: thinking 

350.59 351.00 B: that 

351.44 356.29 A: thinking that you're a liar and a cheat right that's just not going to happen (( )) and so 

351.47 353.25 B: i'm that kind of a person 

353.60 354.99 B: and wanting to change me 

355.35 357.07 B: see i want to be with you forever 

357.73 362.12 B: and i want to change you into this person from this person 

360.58 361.04 A: right 

362.57 362.87 A: yeah 

362.63 366.75 B: and that's what i'm saying to someone it it shouldn't be so hard 

367.27 370.87 B: i felt like my relationship was hard from the moment i got up at 

371.22 373.55 B: in the morning it was 

372.41 373.00 A: (( )) 

373.71 375.45 B: it was constantly work 

374.15 374.76 A: yeah 

375.97 378.76 B: and i compare that to my family relationships 

379.82 385.22 B: and say you know these people don't certainly tell me on a regular basis that i'm you know 

385.54 388.60 B: wrong or what they think i should do instead of what i'm doing 

389.14 391.18 B: they certainly don't think i'm perfect 

391.90 392.50 B: and 

393.17 395.96 A: but they're accepting of of you anyway 

393.92 394.73 B: yet there's definitely 

395.18 398.07 B: but they accept who i am and they love me 

398.05 398.73 A: right 

398.40 400.65 B: you know i know they love me even though 

401.03 405.00 B: they find fault with me and even though they don't expect to change me 

405.21 405.74 A: right 

406.08 409.90 B: and i think that's a lot easier to do with someone you don't have to live with 

411.22 411.59 B: but 

412.32 418.38 B: that's certainly what i would want in a life partner and of course you want someone that's honest 

412.38 413.66 A: yeah that's it 

418.68 418.98 A: uh-huh 

419.80 421.39 B: um i'm committed 

421.72 424.96 B: you know if your going to go into a relationship you don't want someone who's going to 

425.45 428.68 B: like you said you're going through a rough time and they're going to bail out on you 

429.54 429.96 A: yeah 

429.70 432.48 B: now if there's children involved i mean that was the 

433.27 435.73 B: the hardest part of my decision was that 

437.52 437.98 B: you know 

438.18 440.71 B: my daughter is now a product of a broken home 

441.31 441.76 B: and 

441.38 441.81 A: yeah 

442.59 444.33 B: the last thing in the world you want for your 

444.92 445.38 B: children 

446.62 447.83 B: wow 

450.69 451.25 B: okay 

451.06 453.19 A: can you go turn it down yes it's 

453.49 454.60 A: i ah 

465.46 466.82 A: and i just have to 

466.09 466.40 B: (( )) 

467.56 468.24 B: (( )) 

468.20 469.64 A: tessy will you just come get her 

471.00 472.79 A: oh boy interesting 

473.40 475.02 A: will you come get her 

475.17 476.71 A: but ah 

475.76 476.47 B: yes 

476.96 479.11 A: yeah i i i felt 

479.39 480.49 A: in some way 

480.99 483.28 A: at times both of us pressuring each other to 

483.88 484.36 A: to want 

484.57 486.58 A: the other person to change and that always ends up 

486.98 488.69 A: to be kind of a contentious and 

489.25 490.91 A: and non productive situation 

491.41 492.08 A: where as if 

492.87 494.00 A: if she's willing to 

494.45 494.82 A: to 

495.01 496.48 A: to just trust that 

496.91 497.58 A: that i'm going to 

498.80 499.55 A: do better 

500.28 506.64 A: and ah and if she can talk to me out love and express some concerns out of love 

506.83 507.93 A: and ah 

508.12 509.23 B: oh yeah i think that 

508.69 509.64 A: (( )) 

510.38 510.69 A: then 

510.84 512.28 A: but defin- i can 

512.57 513.14 A: i feel like 

513.41 515.60 A: like you did that's very frustrating to be 

516.35 518.65 A: and difficult in in to spend 

518.98 520.10 A: you know all your time 

520.44 521.25 A: dealing with 

522.30 529.49 A: with not living up to someone's expectations and and that frustrating wanting them to change and that would be 

530.79 532.15 B: i i always felt like 

532.99 534.43 B: i'm willing to change 

534.82 535.62 B: behavior 

536.28 536.78 A: uh-huh 

537.30 537.70 A: yeah 

537.93 540.51 B: if if to accommodate the relationship 

540.66 541.12 A: right 

541.58 542.75 B: but i'm not willing 

543.05 544.58 B: to change who i am 

544.70 546.31 A: right your personality per se 

546.31 547.81 B: i mean yeah it's like you know 

548.73 549.25 B: you know 

550.10 550.90 B: i don't know 

552.52 554.61 B: i was asked to you know 

555.22 557.65 B: behavior in ways that weren't who i am 

557.87 559.57 B: and i'm just never going to be 

557.94 558.57 A: uh-huh 

560.18 561.24 B: you know that way 

561.51 561.88 A: yeah 

561.85 562.40 B: and 

562.54 562.84 B: (( the thing is )) 

562.95 566.49 B: it's for good or for bad i mean you know some of the things it's 

566.75 569.92 B: i know i really wish i was different but for whatever reason 

570.32 573.19 B: it just doesn't you know even though i mean feel like i'm 

573.37 575.33 B: just absolutely determined 

575.70 579.11 B: to change this part of my self for example i'm always late 

579.67 580.49 A: (( uh-huh )) 

579.90 581.26 B: i'm always running late 

581.79 582.84 B: and i hate it 

583.04 584.19 B: i hate being late 

584.57 589.88 B: but yet i'm always running late i'm always saying to my daughter hurry up and get in the car hurry up and get in the car and i'm like 

590.32 591.56 B: i hate that about myself 

592.18 592.60 B: but 

592.78 593.90 B: i'm forty eight years old 

594.18 597.69 B: i i've yet been able to successfully been able to change it over the long 

597.87 598.27 B: hall
