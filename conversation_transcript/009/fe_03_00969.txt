0.00 0.84 A: (( hello )) 

0.31 2.33 B: hi my name's trisha 

2.18 4.17 A: hello my name's andy 

3.49 4.71 B: hi andy 

4.70 8.17 A: i was just walking across the room for a moment thanks for holding 

7.51 8.40 B: huh-uh 

10.13 13.43 A: shall we discuss airport security with each other 

13.21 14.95 B: i guess yeah [laughter] 

14.80 16.21 A: excellent 

17.64 18.81 A: i was 

19.55 21.73 A: (( do you have an initial comment )) 

23.06 24.93 B: i think that security is 

25.17 28.56 B: lacks now compared to right after nine eleven 

29.05 43.69 A: yeah i think my overall opinion is summed up by a former mossad agent and head of el al security who said in december when asked to comment you don't have an airport security system in america you have a system to harass passengers i 

43.29 44.36 B: yeah 

44.18 46.40 A: think it was very telling 

45.64 48.15 B: yeah that's um 

49.00 52.99 B: i've flown twice since nine eleven and the first time i felt harassed 

53.38 60.17 B: and this time i felt like maybe they didn't even have their scanners on or whatever we could walk through with keys in our pockets and stuff and 

60.40 62.03 B: that set the alarms off 

60.44 61.50 A: (( i )) 

62.42 70.14 A: have being seeing a lot since then though that the strength of the nation lies not in national guardsmen walking around airports with m16s but rather 

70.17 74.51 A: in adult american men and we are denied gun ownership 

74.75 79.83 A: we are told to act like sheep we are told we will be protected but we are the strength of the nation 

80.84 85.60 A: never again can an airplane be hijacked as long as there is american men on board and women 

85.46 86.67 B: that's right 

87.48 88.51 A: (( so i think )) 

88.58 99.10 A: much is done of the security process at very great expense but we are the strength and not that because anyone can get around the airport system 

99.38 100.42 B: right 

100.71 101.76 B: (( right i know )) 

101.33 106.27 A: but we have to fill this conversation out to a longer component 

104.93 106.66 B: [laughter] 

106.49 108.05 A: [laughter] 

107.60 110.50 B: shall i give you some examples of harassment 

109.34 113.27 A: sure you flew re- where did you fly recently 

112.66 116.60 B: i have gone to orlando twice [laughter] 

116.64 118.75 A: i am in maddison wisconsin where are you 

118.50 122.18 B: i am in iowa [laughter] fort dodge iowa 

121.58 124.47 A: (( do you connect at chigago )) 

124.62 125.95 B: (( minneapolis )) 

125.78 127.50 A: oh you have to go the other way 

127.52 128.53 B: yeah 

129.86 133.42 A: and i haven't flown like in the last couple of years at all 

135.04 143.39 A: overall the airlines aside from security issues the airlines have less money and are more pressured now did you notice that service levels were lower 

142.94 145.46 B: oh yeah that's definitely true 

145.87 146.95 B: yes 

147.66 149.17 A: you know when i was young 

149.50 151.29 A: flying was very special 

151.39 159.84 A: especially like a dc3s and stuff it was very special you always wore your best clothes and it was a big deal but now the airlines have become the greyhound bus of the sky 

159.73 162.25 B: right it's cramped and 

162.68 165.03 A: yeah it's less exciting than the subway 

164.94 168.12 B: [laughter] right and nothing to eat 

167.49 169.54 A: (( it's not special any more it )) 

168.40 170.89 B: to speak of yeah and 

170.24 171.86 A: used to be quite magic 

172.35 174.25 A: the airport security 

173.96 175.08 B: but i got 

175.16 177.79 B: frisked because i had a 

178.26 188.23 B: i had stopped to pick up some breakfast inside the airport which there was a sign that said if you are travelling hungry you can pick up food and bring it on the plane you know because they are not going to give you food on the plane 

187.81 188.91 A: right 

188.69 189.67 B: (( and )) 

189.44 191.62 A: did you just buy like a bagel and orange juice 

191.37 195.39 B: yes i got a muffin and orange juice and a banana 

195.50 197.53 B: and had it in a little bag 

196.95 198.73 A: and these are contraband 

198.90 203.29 B: [laughter] and they so they pulled me out of the line and frisked me in front of everyone 

202.95 203.76 A: wow 

203.53 207.00 B: i had to [laughter] lift up my shirt so they could see my 

207.54 217.54 B: the snap on my jeans which i didn't appreciate which i didn't appreciate doing that [laughter] then i got on the plane and i have i'm travelling with a coat that said 

209.36 211.45 A: [laughter] 

217.68 221.53 B: god bless america and you know flags all over 

220.05 222.59 A: that's considered subversive now [laughter] 

222.36 225.69 B: flag's all over my coat you know and so 

225.71 230.54 B: i got on the plane and found they had even squashed the muffin to make sure there was nothing in it 

229.93 240.65 A: i understood norman meant at its point but i think he is wrong that is to say that frisking eighty year old women in their wheelchairs is simply not checking the problem 

239.90 241.46 B: [laughter] 

241.24 251.41 A: you know and minana has a good point and he comes from a japanese american family and the memory of nine zero six six is very deep to them but 

251.21 261.57 A: the fact is that they are young arab males is the problem and eighty year old women with blue hair is certainly not the problem and frisking them all equally is a waste of resources 

257.31 258.70 B: (( [laughter] no )) 

260.92 262.43 B: yeah that's right 

262.31 273.05 A: not to mention the security component of the airlines is hard on the airlines it's hard on american industry taking guardsmen off their jobs is hard on american productivity and also costs a lot 

272.52 273.42 B: right 

272.82 280.08 A: and economists would say that these are sunk costs they are non-productive efforts they don't return anything back into the society 

280.16 289.58 A: so when you take a machinist away from his lathe and give him an m16 he's not making things any more and that costs the country a lot 

289.11 290.30 B: that's right 

290.32 292.13 A: which is very disturbing 

295.82 304.58 B: when i think of the security now where you can't have your suitcase padlocked is ridiculous because that means anybody that's working in there can steal anything they want now 

305.33 309.00 A: well i don't fly lately but i used to fly a lot for business 

309.03 311.04 A: i would fly with only a briefcase 

311.20 315.21 A: because my time is important and you just can't deal with luggage and airlines 

315.08 328.05 A: if you need if your time is critical you can't check baggage i'm amazed at the stuff that people carry too i mean people will be burdened with a gear bag and a suitcase and a carry on and stuffing piles of crap all over it's like 

327.91 330.55 A: the end of the world and they had to bring everything 

330.46 332.35 B: yeah 

331.95 337.05 A: but again i travel mostly for business so for an overnight you bring a shirt and a pair of socks 

337.20 338.56 A: in your briefcase 

338.00 339.46 B: you'd be amazed 

338.63 340.84 A: and you walk on the plane and walk off the plane 

341.47 342.33 B: yeah 

342.48 343.52 B: i saw 

342.64 344.29 A: i once had go ahead 

343.98 346.90 B: a suitcase that they decided 

346.93 352.58 B: must have had something in it and i could tell right off that it was the emblem on the outside of the bag 

352.84 358.53 B: they had this lady take everything out she has taken bath brushes and just all kinds of stuff out of her suitcase and finally 

357.59 359.87 A: she couldn't live two days without it 

358.95 365.70 B: [laughter] no and finally they realised there was an emblem on the outside of her suitcase that was 

365.47 367.45 A: oh it was a metallic emblem 

366.90 368.81 B: [laughter] yeah so 

368.13 369.17 A: (( great )) 

369.69 379.18 B: for all holding everybody up because somebody wasn't able to determine that there wasn't anything in the bag that was a problem it was the emblem on the outside 

378.24 380.10 A: i have a very good friend in 

380.35 391.77 A: who when people start talking about conspiracies of the government they are afraid of the government with a capital g. he says you're afraid of the government go to the post office and see what civil servants look like you should not be afraid of them [laughter] 

390.79 392.54 B: [laughter] 

395.44 404.40 A: it's one thing to talk about conspiracy theories of the government running our lives but you are talking about the people who are doing the suitcase thing as being the agents and it just doesn't go that way 

403.98 405.10 B: yeah 

405.74 407.87 A: they're drawing on the same gene pool 

407.49 411.93 B: and i'm thinking about the huge expense that they put 

411.95 414.90 B: into putting these huge x-ray machines in there 

415.20 427.03 A: right but if you've been reading the papers the last two weeks they have admitted that the problem is not men with box cutters opening stewardesses necks the problem is that there are tens of thousands of surface to air missiles 

427.08 433.54 A: and the flight approach path to the airport cannot be protected because a mile off the runway you're in a neighborhood 

433.35 442.93 A: and you can't protect from that and they have used surface to air missiles in nigeria last fall there is going to be more of those 

434.80 436.03 B: that's right 

443.54 456.75 A: and there is no way to defend against it so of course the worrisome people are now talking about the military series chatter that dissuade the missile from attacking your plane by making it go the other way 

456.56 464.69 A: it cost one million dollars per aircraft do you know how many commercial aircraft there are like tens of thousands they're crazy absolutely crazy 

458.49 459.76 B: oh my gosh 

460.46 461.57 B: (( oh )) 

461.86 462.92 B: yeah 

463.76 467.71 B: oh my gosh and i don't think saddam's so stupid that he would 

468.08 472.94 B: you know or bin laden or bin laden yeah they're not going to try attacking the planes again that way so 

468.79 470.24 A: he's not the problem 

472.52 477.28 A: no they will never do it because they read clausewitz the same way we read clausewitz so 

477.26 491.22 A: the element of surprise is all and it'll be something different it could be tens of thousands of different things and you cannot defend a country on that basis you can't watch every power plant and every approach to every airline and every subway car 

480.06 481.42 B: right that's right 

491.02 491.93 B: (( no )) 

491.78 495.57 A: and trying to do it is just very expensive and counterproductive it 

496.45 497.87 B: that's good work 

497.01 498.81 A: would have to be fought the other way 

498.53 499.45 B: yeah 

499.10 506.83 A: i was just talking to a friend of mine who teaches e._f._l. in chicago deals with a lot of the current diaspora from africa who are mostly muslim 

507.78 513.02 A: and he is struck by the fact that these people are just in abject ignorance you know it's part of muslim 

512.89 518.78 A: culture around the world it's abject ignorance so the people who have come here and are trying to learn english 

514.12 515.05 B: right 

515.34 516.31 B: (( huh-uh )) 

518.63 528.77 A: are a very small subset of that but the abject poverty in ignorance is what allows people to feel that shooting down an airplane is somehow a worthy goal 

528.45 529.77 B: yeah that's 

529.09 530.83 A: because they know nothing else 

531.23 541.61 A: and you know you might point out i point out too that these people are flying our airplanes into our buildings but they cannot build airplanes nor could they build those buildings 

541.86 546.00 A: these are cultures bereft of advancement and people wallow in ignorance 

546.21 550.81 A: and ignorance is the problem but the arab world has the highest birth rate in the world 

550.93 552.36 A: and it's going to get worse 

553.11 553.98 B: yeah 

554.07 561.53 A: and that's the end that should be attacked and it's a harder problem it's easy to spend money to have people walk around airports with m16s 

562.15 565.62 A: it's hard to educate a people and give them something to live for 

565.99 567.08 B: that's right 

567.38 569.95 A: but that would be the more effective 

572.04 576.36 B: yeah and to teach them they are not going to seven virgins when they die or whatever that deal was 

575.76 580.17 A: i mean who would believe that crap but when you have nothing else in life 

577.15 578.30 B: [laughter] 

579.63 580.93 B: yeah 

580.71 581.61 A: then 

582.00 584.02 A: that seems reasonable 

583.64 586.79 B: yeah if you could be brainwashed so easily 

586.74 599.95 A: typically after we washed out of somalia who went into somalia the saudis who are the only monients in somalia and they provide koran schools to teach people who are starving and ignorant
