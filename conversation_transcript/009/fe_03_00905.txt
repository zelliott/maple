148.55 149.68 A: yeah 

150.60 151.65 A: yeah 

153.69 167.73 A: yeah the gro- you know what i usually do i watch the first one the first ah challenge that they have then usually the second one is usually gross so i usually go do something else so i don't have to watch them eat something gross or you know something really disgusting 

159.28 161.56 B: and then get rid of the second one [laughter] 

162.23 163.34 B: yeah 

167.57 178.13 A: then i come back for the last [laughter] half and like it's the fi- the fir the last one and the first one [mn] you know i can watch but usually the second one is [noise] too gross i can't stomach it 

169.70 171.09 B: yeah me too 

173.26 174.38 B: right 

177.25 179.30 B: yeah i'm the same way 

178.86 180.83 A: yeah [laughter] 

180.00 185.10 B: i don't like watching what they have to eat all those stuff they make 'em eat just makes me sick thinking about it 

184.51 193.46 A: [noise] i know [noise] on ah when was it on last time it was on they had needles going in their arms that was instead of eating something gross that was 

192.44 194.03 B: what was that for 

193.92 200.56 A: um that was [noise] i think their second challenge and they had to endure ten needles being 

199.99 200.81 B: (( ooh )) 

200.35 210.99 A: i know it was kinda disgusting [laughter] to watch but i could watch it because it wasn't you know eating worms or something disgusting like that [sigh] but ah it was kinda weird how they 

209.98 211.94 B: were they being injected with something 

212.06 215.43 A: no they weren't injected it's just the needle going through the skin 

215.21 227.28 A: so they would put the needle in in their arm they had to endure ten needles of different sizes the needles got larger [sigh] as you know he kept going and yeah they put it like in the skin 

215.75 216.65 B: (( ooh )) 

223.75 225.44 B: oh that's disgusting 

227.08 234.65 A: so you had you know the si- the two sizes of needles sticking out and it was underneath the skin it was really disgusting [laughter] 

234.03 235.68 B: oh that's disgusting 

234.90 238.42 A: but [laughter] i know that was pretty hard to watch 

237.97 241.63 B: i saw that on the previews and i thought what are they doing injecting each 

241.95 248.92 A: no they had a i guess there had to have been a nurse or somebody who was putting ah needle through the skin to see if they could endure it 

242.72 243.79 B: (( other ooh )) 

248.92 252.69 B: that's just like medically dangerous they could get infection or 

252.64 262.34 A: i know it it was kinda disgusting 'cause the first time the first person i saw do it it didn't seem so bad but the more i watched i thought oh my god 

262.03 263.63 B: yeah that's terrible 

262.99 271.37 A: yeah it was kinda hard to watch after a while but but i- it's ah it's somewhat interesting [laughter] 

266.32 267.61 B: (( that's nasty )) 

269.77 270.78 B: yeah 

271.38 277.39 B: i like to i like watching joe millionaire because the women that were on there that were just there for the money 

276.99 278.34 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

277.67 280.12 B: they made such fools out of themselves 

279.48 287.93 A: i kn- especially the last two that was there not the girl who won but the other one who thought she was gonna win you know i i uh she was 

283.99 285.01 B: yeah 

285.11 286.06 B: yeah 

287.10 290.29 B: and she was totally she was totally a gold digger 

289.67 292.02 A: i know absolutely 

290.78 292.61 B: she just wanted the money 

292.10 293.29 A: i know 

293.07 296.50 B: but you know they're not even together any more the people who won 

296.11 302.53 A: so i've heard i guess they just split the money and that's the end of that they just wanted maybe the publicity or something 

299.28 300.48 B: yeah 

302.10 307.09 B: yeah but none o- none of these shows that make up these matches none of them have even lasted 

305.63 310.53 A: (( [mn] um i know but supposedly the bachelorette they're still together )) 

310.60 311.90 B: yeah but that just 

310.73 311.57 A: (( tristen )) 

311.94 314.18 B: that just that just ended 

314.23 315.49 A: yeah 

314.87 316.93 B: that wasn't a real long time ago 

318.84 319.78 B: (( you know )) 

319.29 322.26 A: b- yeah but aren't they the couple's still together though 

322.57 324.56 A: they're not no 

322.86 324.08 B: i don't know 

325.10 327.10 B: [noise] you hear different things you know 

327.32 333.25 A: [mn] i think maybe they just do it for the money 'cause i know if ah i couldn't do survivor or anything like that 

333.03 334.16 B: oh no 

333.08 346.17 A: 'cause [laughter] 'cause um i've been thinking would i ever do a reality show and which one would i do and survivor is certainly not one of 'em and i would never do a bachelorette or any well i'm married so [laughter] i couldn't do any of those 

342.97 343.98 B: no 

343.99 344.77 B: [laughter] 

346.55 347.58 A: but 

346.64 348.08 B: you definitely wouldn't be doing 

348.60 352.59 A: no no not at all and then there was another one um 

352.63 358.75 A: [lipsmack] i'm trying to think [noise] it was it's on c._b._s. in the summertime i've watched it the first time 

358.95 364.31 A: um they're the people who live in the house or something like that i can't big brother 

364.30 366.37 B: oh yeah i like big brother 

365.77 367.30 A: yeah 

366.71 368.26 B: i like that 

367.53 373.85 A: yeah that's normally on in the summertime i watched it pretty religiously the first time out and then 

373.65 384.12 A: the last two times it was on i kinda you know i would catch shows and i would miss a lotta shows but that one is kind of interesting and [mn] that's probably the only one i would even attempt 

384.08 390.03 B: yeah i like big brother i think that's fun but they a- they all get really nasty with each other in the end anyway 

384.20 385.58 A: [laughter] 

389.31 391.59 A: yeah that's true they do 

390.84 395.90 B: you know they all they all start talking behind their backs and making all kinds of ah 

395.97 398.38 B: you know pacts and ugh 

397.21 398.26 A: (( uh-huh )) 

398.99 399.90 B: (( but [lipsmack] )) 

399.91 403.85 B: i think i think they're a lot better than most of the sitcoms that are on t._v. 

403.46 414.58 A: well you know i'm not a big sitcom watcher i watch like the practice and i watch some of the reality shows and and that that's you know kinda the stuff when i do watch t._v. that i kinda watch 

406.30 407.37 B: yeah 

409.87 410.85 B: uh-huh 

414.59 418.07 A: reality shows though i mean they're kinda fun to watch 'cause it's real people 

417.70 418.83 B: yeah 

418.08 420.49 A: and uh you know 

420.95 424.75 A: even though some of 'em are kinda silly and you know 

424.18 425.16 B: uh-huh 

424.76 426.55 A: [mn] scraping the 

425.34 427.34 B: they do things that you normally wouldn't do 

426.91 441.84 A: yeah kinda scraping [laughter] the bottom there they're still just kinda fun to just sit there and watch 'cause you watch other shows and they talk about oh i would never watch that you know on this high horse thing but i mean [sigh] i think they're somewhat fun to watch people make fools of themselves [laughter] 

435.01 436.15 B: yeah 

440.50 445.77 B: now what about this new one um where america marries these people 

444.99 458.67 A: [mn] i didn't i missed it i wanted to see it and i guess i got screwed up with the times because i used to live on the east coast and since i've moved here i'm central time zone i miss a lot of things [laughter] 'cause i keep thinking eastern time and then 

454.32 455.34 B: uh-huh 

458.11 459.55 B: oh okay 

458.88 465.06 A: and i end up missing it but i ended up missing it a couple of n- i think it was on a couple of nights ago or something so i didn't see it 

463.90 473.15 B: yeah i didn't see it but i i wanna see it 'cause i can't imagine that people are so desperate for publicity that they'll just go marry anybody 

472.58 483.60 A: i know i wonder if they get any mo- they have to get some kinda money i i ca- i can't see somebody doing that without you know somebody upping [laughter] some money somewhere 

476.92 478.39 B: (( they have to )) 

483.50 485.32 B: something has to be going on 

484.44 486.34 A: yeah exactly 

486.02 490.51 B: 'cause that's pretty bad when you say okay just i'll marry whoever you want me to 

490.00 502.82 A: i know i know but supposedly i think isn't a family member or a couple of family members or somebody they know that's kinda helping to pick out the other person or something i'm not sure 

502.02 506.01 B: i don't know 'cause i i haven't seen it i've only heard people talk about it 

505.32 506.36 A: uh-huh 

506.21 513.18 B: and they were saying on the radio this morning when i was driving to work that they had really really high ratings 

509.79 510.67 A: uh-huh 

512.88 514.20 A: really 

513.82 515.93 B: yeah really high ratings 

515.35 519.74 A: well i i need to try to catch it make sure i catch it next week 

519.56 527.98 B: oh here it i'm i'm just ah i have the computer in front of me and there's a um actually an article about it on a._o._l.'s front page 

527.39 530.26 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

528.23 529.28 B: (( [laughter] )) 

530.08 534.50 B: i guess talking about the the way that americans are obsessed with reality television 

534.13 536.04 A: (( i know they're fun though )) 

535.84 537.17 B: they are 

536.58 538.64 A: they are do you watch american idol 

539.02 540.11 B: no 

539.62 544.52 A: no oh that's good that's my other favorite one outside of survivor it's uh 

540.63 541.75 B: (( no )) 

543.55 545.61 B: (( but that guy's nasty )) 

545.12 546.89 A: (( [mn] but he tells the truth )) 

547.08 549.08 A: (( the ah a lotta people )) 

549.16 558.88 A: talk and say how bad he is i guess the way he comes off and the way he says it is really kinda bad but he really tells the truth so i i like simon 

554.16 554.74 B: (( [noise] )) 

555.28 556.40 B: yeah 

558.98 560.09 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

559.47 565.50 A: i i don't have a problem with him it's he does you know there's a way to tell somebody you stink without saying you stink 

562.69 563.51 B: [noise] 

565.35 566.48 B: right 

565.70 577.63 A: and ah he just tells it like it is straight no regards for feelings [mn] you know nothing whatsoever and i guess the only problem i have with that is is because the it's you know 

577.59 587.25 A: teenagers i think they have to be eighteen to twenty five or something like that so you're talking about young [mn] you know somewhat young people i think to talk to them like 

585.80 588.99 B: yeah these people could really be damaged [laughter] 

587.68 596.20 A: yeah i- it's kind of a little harsh for that age group [mn] so in terms of that i wish he would you know somewhat tone it down a little bit or or 

591.22 592.17 B: yeah 

596.35 599.89 A: say it a little easier but i think it needs to be said too
