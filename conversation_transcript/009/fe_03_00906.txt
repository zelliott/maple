85.50 88.27 A: wh- what was the first one that you remember seeing 

88.16 91.92 B: ah the original survivor i think probably yeah 

89.61 91.00 A: (( the original survivor )) 

91.30 93.64 A: do you re- do you remember the big brother 

93.82 101.10 B: kinda yeah they lived in a house yeah i kinda remember that one yeah 

96.91 99.06 A: yeah and then they 

100.42 110.88 A: they had one that i wasn't really crazy about it was called temptation island and that's where they took the couples on this island and and they tempted 'em with other um 

110.98 118.65 A: other women or men against 'em to see if they um their love would hold and now that was [mn] i i wasn't too crazy about that one 

118.83 120.83 A: (( but [mn] [noise] )) 

119.55 122.54 B: did the love hold for any of them i'm curious 

122.02 125.91 A: um i [noise] i think i think two of the couples made it [laughter] 

125.93 128.47 B: they must have thrown a lotta temptation in there 

127.54 132.03 A: th- th- yes they did uh my wife was crazy about that one 

131.60 133.72 B: i don't remember that one no 

132.97 133.86 A: (( [noise] )) 

133.84 137.74 B: the only one i think i watched consistently was the first survivor 

137.09 138.52 A: first survivor 

138.15 142.45 B: yeah i don't really remember where the second one was um 

142.80 145.69 B: [mn] but then they've had so many others like the [sigh] 

145.81 149.21 B: the one where they went from one point to the other and 

150.31 153.71 B: [lipsmack] and then i think they had another big brother didn't they have more than one 

150.36 151.45 A: yeah 

152.97 160.50 A: yeah i think i think they had a i think they had three big brothers i do believe now that race you was talking about that that one was pretty cool 'cause they had to go from um 

160.58 166.78 A: from point to point and they had to get a clue and solve the clue and whoever got there first that that was interesting too 

161.98 163.05 B: right 

166.29 170.35 B: i don't know if that's exactly the same thing like a survivor or 

169.51 171.28 A: it's really not 

171.03 176.05 B: or even that island thing you're talking about i don't is that the same kinda thing do you think 

173.41 174.28 A: yeah 

175.85 178.11 A: it's um [sigh] it's 

178.65 191.38 A: [mn] to me when they say reality t._v. i think of big brother because they put them all in a room they put twenty five of 'em [mn] or was it twelve they put them in there and see how they would react with other people 

191.51 196.43 A: now me ma'am my idea of reality t._v. is to put twenty five men 

196.48 204.85 A: in a room during football season and have that forty game ticket playing on there with one remote 

202.52 204.05 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

204.87 206.71 B: oh that would be interesting 

205.68 211.71 A: and and and that would be interesting to see how that end come would be you know [laughter] i mean 

209.44 210.56 B: [laughter] 

210.78 213.23 B: i think there'd be a mass homicide probably 

212.24 223.94 A: i do believe that would be i do b- i believe a mass suicide more or less [laughter] [laughter] well now ma- maybe maybe they use this recording for that you know [laughter] 

214.10 217.19 B: [laughter] 

217.23 219.34 B: that would be pretty interesting 

222.82 226.31 B: i don't know but [mn] they were talking about a show where 

226.47 235.41 B: like i think it was kinda reality t._v. where you if somebody like hurt you or did something to you you could get back at them or or something like that like ah 

235.66 239.90 B: like scare them or i do- i don't ever know what happened with that but it was kinda 

239.55 242.37 A: well they they were talking about putting something like that on this season 

242.68 245.34 B: i haven't i haven't seen anything on that i wo- [noise] 

243.33 249.49 A: yeah and then and then they have all these um celebrity um i think they had a celebrity boot camp 

249.40 251.31 B: yeah i think that's still going on 

251.16 252.99 A: i- is it still going on 

252.45 256.54 B: [lipsmack] i think it might be like i'm a celebrity get me out of here 

253.86 255.80 A: because i saw the first 

256.15 257.97 A: yeah that was that's one too 

257.62 262.46 B: yeah maybe that's to see if they can rough it [laughter] i 

261.29 263.93 A: [laughter] they can afford it can't 

264.57 265.44 A: (( they [noise] )) 

264.82 266.50 B: guess so 

266.72 274.92 B: an- and actually some of the people from from the like the survivor shows have gone on to do other things so 

275.29 279.51 B: [mn] y- y- you know on t._v. and other places so 

277.13 278.68 A: (( yeah )) 

279.64 283.53 A: now have you s- did you have you ever seen that fear factor that comes on monday nights 

283.05 288.79 B: i yeah with the bungy jump bumping and eating worms and 

287.61 290.25 A: yeah like when they get to the eating worms part's where i 

289.41 291.72 B: ooh i don't know about that 

291.07 295.44 A: [laughter] 'cause i don't i don't know if they do they do they consider that reality t._v. [mn] 

294.89 296.19 B: i don't know 

296.73 299.89 B: [mn] you know i don't really know if they do or they don't 

299.13 301.52 A: that's more um a games show i do- 

301.59 304.61 B: in a way but it's kind of a really strange one 

303.83 305.67 A: it is isn't it [laughter] 

305.25 309.96 B: i guess if they're real i don't know you know real people not actors then 

310.30 313.97 B: it is reality t._v. i- i'm not really sure i mean 

314.13 320.43 B: the li- [mn] as they keep making more of them it's like the line gets more blurry what is and what isn't 

318.76 328.56 A: yeah it does it it i mean um when they came up with survivor and big brother to me that was that was good but then they started making everything they had the bachelor the bachelorette 

325.40 326.53 B: yeah 

328.63 341.86 A: and all of that and that that was to um try to match up and they [mn] they called it reality t._v. because they were seeing if um a man could choose out of twelve strange women you know who he wanted to marry then they had who wants to marry a millionaire 

336.71 337.70 B: mhm 

341.48 343.77 B: then they had that joe millionaire [laughter] 

343.18 347.73 A: they had joe millionaire which he was on he only made um thirty thousand a year [laughter] 

348.06 352.13 A: and now he then they said he's got his brother they're making one about his brother 

352.48 353.88 A: (( [mn] ah [sigh] )) 

353.54 356.27 B: i don't know if they're reality ones or not 

356.81 360.82 B: i mean how real is being on an island where you have to 

360.94 363.22 B: i guess that is real i don't know 

363.47 368.30 B: it probably is it's like you have to just start from scratch and 

366.99 379.32 A: [sigh] well n- you know surv- now the first survivor they they supplied 'em with stuff and so with the second one but with this amazon they didn't give 'em anything no they didn't give 'em anything they had they had to start from scratch 

375.79 376.91 B: oh really 

379.40 380.94 B: oh i didn't know that 

380.30 390.20 A: yeah 'cause that w- that was a big thing about it they had to build their own shelters find their own food and [mn] i think they helped 'em as far as medical wise and stuff like that but [mn] 

390.51 396.20 A: when it got down to you know they had to build their own shelter now that's real survival to me 

395.62 397.84 B: that that is that is 

398.15 402.89 B: h- how did the person from from your state do though on that 

401.67 410.60 A: i really don't know that now like i said the girl from the second one um cathy she she didn't last very long i think she lasted uh 

410.68 416.56 A: what was it two nights [laughter] and then they voted her off 'cause she was she was a little bossy 

412.21 412.77 B: (( [cough] )) 

417.20 419.18 A: and she was too too m- 

418.04 420.50 B: was she on the first one or one of the ones 

419.74 424.79 A: i think it was the second one she was the one that worked at the ah mack truck factory 

423.73 425.68 B: oh okay okay okay 

424.93 427.50 A: (( you know which one i'm talking about okay )) 

426.08 427.11 B: yeah 

427.76 431.79 A: and um she w- she was from winsborough tenness- um south carolina 

431.38 432.11 B: (( oh )) 

433.18 435.87 B: so you've had a couple from your state then two or three 

434.91 437.57 A: [noise] yeah we there w- i think so far there was two [sigh] 

439.29 448.73 B: that's pretty neat i i don't know [mn] like truthfully any more is to me it's getting boring like after the first and second and third one then it's 

445.27 448.06 A: (( yeah )) 

448.95 452.11 B: it just seems like it's like copying 

451.75 453.47 A: yeah 

452.95 455.41 B: so i don't know um 

455.91 457.00 B: i don't know 

457.97 463.38 B: i don't know if they're to me they're still as popular as they were but they must be or they wouldn't keep making them 

462.67 465.80 A: they- they're definitely making more and more of 'em 

465.26 468.10 B: [mn] so i i can't really think of any 

468.21 473.12 B: right now that i'm that i [mn] even thinking of watching i i like 

473.21 475.16 B: i don't know i mean to me 

475.34 479.06 B: [mn] they started back with like star search that's that's um 

479.24 484.93 B: i don't want to say that's reality 'cause that's not really reality but they started that show back and 

485.52 490.32 A: well how about the how about the um american idol would they consider that reality t._v. 

489.03 491.99 B: i don't know i yeah in a way

511.20 512.42 A: (( and )) 

512.13 517.53 B: i don't know if that's would you consider that a a survival show though or a reality show 

516.79 522.67 A: well then [laughter] if you're no good there's no reason going is there [laughter] 

521.18 522.66 B: [mn] that's true 

523.12 532.44 B: whereas like the survival shows or the first one they just [cough] took people from who made the cut but i guess in a way it is the same thing 

531.60 542.27 A: [cough] well see you get those people in survivor and they've got wives or husbands and they got kids and they're leaving for [noise] thirty days i don't believe i could do that i'm [laughter]
