131.65 134.35 B: now what was it what is the most important thing 

134.87 136.18 A: the most important i think 

136.41 136.83 A: i don't 

136.92 137.68 A: remember the first 

137.10 139.10 B: quality in a life partner 

138.13 138.94 A: quality is (( )) 

139.20 139.83 A: yes 

140.23 140.85 B: okay 

140.55 141.01 A: mhm 

143.24 145.00 A: i think maybe flexibility 

146.09 147.63 B: flexibility is a good one 

148.58 150.28 B: i was going to say cash but 

150.26 155.71 A: that's a well i don't know mine mine doesn't have a whole lot of cash 

150.43 151.71 B: oh 

155.23 157.57 B: yeah i uh just joking there um 

155.84 156.21 A: so 

157.04 159.06 A: my i know i think that's true though -cause a lot of um 

159.57 159.92 A: (( but i )) 

160.19 163.02 A: supposedly the number one problem in relationships is money 

163.37 163.77 A: but um 

164.64 165.63 A: money related 

164.78 165.18 B: uh hm 

166.11 168.23 B: um maybe not so much money but 

168.40 168.86 B: like 

169.00 170.12 B: like minded 

170.81 171.95 A: e- exactly 

185.40 187.87 B: want to travel or do vacations or something 

188.01 189.22 A: or save it 

189.08 189.90 B: or just save it 

190.14 192.21 A: um my husband and i have that problem i 

192.32 198.06 A: found a restaurant that is a hundred and fifty dollars which is for me we usually go to johnny rockets 

198.18 202.92 A: but i wanted to go to really nice one and he said a hundred and fifty dollars that's what i make blah blah blah 

203.50 211.20 A: but i i think the point is that we have to come to the reason i say (( )) is because in anything whether it's money or or whatever the decisions you are making 

211.46 212.83 A: we have to come to a point 

213.27 213.61 A: you know 

213.78 214.37 A: in the middle 

214.86 215.22 B: right 

215.54 221.34 A: my point was i'll do our taxes instead of h. and r. block and we'll save that money and then we'll go out to eat and that was the agreement 

222.88 229.08 A: i think that you know i- whatever it is whether it's money or how you raise your children you always have to meet 

229.28 230.49 A: really somewhere in the middle 

230.59 231.27 B: yeah 

230.90 231.69 A: (( )) different 

232.50 233.00 B: yeah 

233.93 238.92 B: um i would think another important one would just be like um humor 

239.49 239.96 A: oh that's 

240.20 241.88 A: yeah that's good 

241.70 244.03 B: and um compatibility 

244.64 246.81 B: i guess that kind of goes back to the money thing 

248.14 248.77 A: that you would think 

248.87 250.04 A: same way about a lot of 

249.82 252.85 B: yeah compatibility and values and 

253.14 255.22 B: like you said raising children 

256.46 261.74 A: i i you know i suppose that there are a lot of factors that could be important if you're compatible then you don't need to be as flexible 

262.24 265.04 A: or if you are if you are very flexible then you can work out 

265.26 267.22 A: differences that you you know normally 

267.50 267.91 B: mhm 

269.81 272.68 A: my husband is actually he is muslim and he is turkish 

272.81 281.69 A: so we have uh uh and i'm southern uh (( )) christ so we have a very uh uh big difference between our you know the way we view the world 

283.43 286.97 B: you know and that's a good one too um sort of religious 

288.25 288.98 B: um 

289.42 294.10 B: and general you know values and and the way you view the world 

295.54 298.67 A: well that's i think that's part of what you were saying about compatibility 

299.05 299.48 B: yeah 

300.39 300.67 A: um 

300.81 301.59 A: i t- in 

302.00 307.93 A: um maybe open-mindedness because i mean i i realize and my husband realizes that we don't have to agree about religion 

309.08 310.17 A: i don't have to 

310.34 315.74 A: to have the same feelings about mohammed and he doesn't have to feel the same way about jesus that i do and we we really 

315.92 318.06 A: we've discussed religion but not in uh 

318.73 323.37 A: in a very deep sense and as far as our children are concerned we've agreed to you know 

324.13 327.57 A: provide them the information about both religions and let them make their own choice 

327.73 328.18 B: mhm 

328.23 329.90 A: um i think that's yeah um that's 

329.99 331.77 A: that was actually very hard for me 

332.28 332.55 A: -cause 

332.69 336.58 A: and him too i guess if you believe the way you believe you want your children to believe that 

336.84 337.68 B: exactly 

337.32 342.28 A: but um but in the end i thought that my children are going to believe what they what they want to anyway 

342.47 343.71 A: whatever i teach them 

344.59 345.11 A: then 

344.90 345.23 B: well you 

345.34 347.35 B: you should be in charge of the world melinda 

347.39 350.01 A: i should i really want to be 

347.93 350.89 B: half the world i mean half the world is fighting over this 

350.85 351.68 A: i know 

352.40 355.88 A: i know um i think we are doing pretty good though -cause we don't fight over it 

356.08 356.92 A: at all 

357.01 358.91 A: i mean there are other things too um 

359.46 359.92 A: i mean if 

360.10 369.18 A: but a young uh circumcision i think is another thing that we've discussed about children which we don't have yet their their friends get circumcised at around eight years old 

369.29 369.98 A: it's like uh 

369.66 371.13 B: oh ouch 

370.44 372.41 A: a right to manhood 

373.01 373.83 A: kind of um 

374.84 380.35 A: uh you know ceremony the whole they wear crowns around and they look like little princes and everything and 

376.54 377.06 B: uh-huh 

380.12 380.79 B: wow 

380.65 382.44 A: and i said no 

382.56 385.19 A: i'm not my son is not being circumcised today 

385.43 386.55 A: but you know 

386.76 389.63 A: we have to disc- we we have discussed that and and 

389.74 391.21 A: you know presented our sides and 

392.25 393.94 A: and um and i won of course no 

394.36 398.14 B: yeah well yeah at least you are on the right track then 

397.36 398.33 A: yeah 

398.79 400.36 A: um but that's i mean we are 

400.56 403.39 A: being i think just being flexible and 

403.69 407.57 A: whether you are compatible uh i think compatibility just makes it easier to start with 

408.87 412.89 A: but if you don't have that then you have to be willing to work with the other person to get through the 

413.31 414.49 A: know the differences that 

414.79 415.50 A: that you have 

416.84 418.08 B: yeah um 

418.44 419.07 B: and 

420.35 423.29 B: being able to enjoy each other's company as a companion 

426.01 427.28 A: i know some i oh 

427.46 428.84 A: people that i know who 

429.14 429.81 A: who don't really 

430.05 432.18 A: care to spend time with each other and i wonder 

432.96 433.29 A: i mean 

433.64 435.36 A: i understand staying in a marriage 

435.70 437.17 A: for whatever reason that you have 

437.58 437.84 A: but 

438.70 441.39 A: if you don't really enjoy being with someone you know 

441.61 445.93 A: uh uh that come out over time or is that you know is that how they were in the beginning 

446.37 447.36 A: i always wonder that 

448.08 450.65 B: i would think probably they were always like that 

451.10 455.80 B: but there was some maybe like a physical attraction or something that um 
456.49 458.39 B: yet they didn't notice it for awhile 

459.27 460.99 B: but the problems were always there 

459.40 459.76 A: uh-huh 

461.40 463.59 A: and they were a- already married i guess maybe 

464.08 464.47 B: right 

464.90 466.27 B: and then by the time they 

466.53 474.09 B: you know all of a sudden they wake up and realize they are strangers or they don't have anything in common or they are missing those compatibility 

474.34 476.24 B: life value things and 

475.91 477.79 A: sounds like a country song 

477.62 478.17 B: yeah 

478.43 480.66 B: set that to music 

480.37 482.93 A: i woke up one day next to a stranger 

483.70 489.31 A: actually it is a it is a country song already there is a variation of that but i can't remember what it is 

483.74 485.49 B: that's good 

489.84 494.27 A: but it's so funny because it totally it uh brought that country song back in to my mind 

495.37 497.76 A: it's something about i don't you know i don't know you 

498.00 498.81 A: who are you 

499.22 499.68 A: that's so 

499.39 499.93 B: yeah 

500.75 503.17 B: i i i just think that happens to a lot of people 

500.77 502.25 A: that's not funny if you're living it then 

503.47 505.97 A: yeah i think so i mean i've seen a lot of people who 

506.61 510.60 A: um i just it totally wonder why they are married and they just said well we are 

512.08 512.58 A: that's it 

512.73 515.28 A: they are they they don't have any illusions of 

515.41 519.36 A: that they have this great marriage but then they they are in it and they stay in it 

520.01 522.15 B: -cause you start to develop a history 

522.58 523.47 B: and you know 

524.13 525.86 B: bank accounts and 

526.27 530.82 B: you know then children come along and before you know it it's like you are just going down that path 

532.13 533.60 A: and i can understand i guess 

534.30 535.17 A: how it happens 

535.75 536.61 A: not really but 

537.27 538.62 A: i can see that it would but 

538.89 540.06 B: yeah i i i 

540.92 543.78 B: and i guess some people just aren't very strong or they are not 

544.29 547.34 B: really thinking about the big picture or looking ahead and 

548.94 549.59 A: or maybe 

548.96 549.65 B: they just kind of 

549.95 551.13 B: you know go down the road 

550.22 550.68 A: (( )) 

551.72 553.00 A: and maybe i think a lot of 

553.24 556.26 A: especially women are s- just scared to be alone they would rather be in 

556.63 557.46 A: have something 

557.84 558.35 A: than 

558.62 560.52 A: the idea of going out you know and 

563.07 565.01 A: sense of security of being with someone 

565.55 570.75 B: you know i i think you are exactly right melinda because some people are just afraid to um 

570.94 574.93 B: you know it's better than nothing or it's you know they are afraid of the unknown 

575.35 576.98 B: they don't have enough confidence 

578.36 581.80 B: i knew somebody once that was going out with a married guy 

582.36 585.31 B: for like ten years and it's like why are you doing this 

585.47 585.94 B: i mean 

586.30 589.13 B: you know this has no future you know there will be something 

589.84 593.73 B: you know you at least have a chance if you if you get out of this but 

593.91 596.27 B: just it was comfortable and you know
