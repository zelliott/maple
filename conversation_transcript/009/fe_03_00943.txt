13.57 26.41 B: um my favorite holiday is probably christmas i know it sounds kind of [laughter] cheesy but [laughter] i just thi- it seems like that seems to be a more important holiday for everybody so everybody seems to make an effort to get together so 

15.92 16.93 A: yeah 

17.20 19.78 A: no that would be mine too [laughter] 

25.43 27.44 A: mhm yeah that would be true 

26.94 30.98 B: there's always a lot of family around [noise] [noise] 

28.75 29.84 A: mhm 

29.95 38.01 A: well that's ah for us it's just we're my family's christian and so you know it's it's definitely a celebration of of uh 

38.06 44.19 A: a lot of the basis of what we believe so it's a really big deal for for our family as well so 

38.11 38.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

44.30 47.44 A: um you know just from from that perspective but 

47.14 52.53 B: mhm right do you guys spend like christmas eve at church for a church service or anything like 

51.84 60.82 A: well this year we didn't because we're in a new church and they didn't they didn't have a service at our church but ah we have a lot in the past how about you 

57.99 60.38 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

60.78 71.86 B: um no we used to when i was um when i was in the military i was very into um my church and they used to have a a christmas eve service and all the kids would come in their pajamas to sing [laughter] so 

69.03 76.01 A: uh huh [laughter] uh-huh yeah so you were in the military wow well that's um 

73.34 74.37 B: mhm 

76.23 83.15 A: we had ah one church that we were involved in one time had the pajama service for with all the kids and everything that was so much fun 

83.23 85.14 A: we really enjoyed that but 

85.17 86.21 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

87.02 95.69 A: yeah we usually we enjoyed um the candle light services at church that some churches have and that but that's usually been our favorites 

92.41 93.29 B: (( mhm right )) 

97.12 98.74 A: but yeah so um 

98.93 105.85 A: i i think the other question was if if there would be a holiday that we could invent [laughter] do you have any idea on that one 

103.74 105.25 B: right 

105.65 113.70 B: oh i don't know that sounds too much like an essay question [laughter] [laughter] if i could invent a holiday i don't know i mean probably 

107.99 110.72 A: i know [laughter] i'm n- 

114.00 123.52 B: i don't know that i would invent one i know the the kwanza holiday kinda has a lot of things you know that if i had to invent a holiday would be things you know more of a teaching thing and to 

117.49 118.31 A: (( uh huh )) 

123.30 129.35 B: kind of instill mor- you know and reinforce morals and and good characteristics and qualities in people 

123.36 124.13 A: (( uh huh )) 

126.57 127.60 A: right 

128.60 129.64 A: right 

130.38 133.85 B: so that one does a lot with you know sharing and 

130.53 131.83 A: (( that's a that's a neat idea )) 

132.68 133.78 A: mhm 

134.56 138.88 B: um [lipsmack] honoring people and and respect and loyalty and things [laughter] mhm 

136.11 137.27 A: right 

138.79 152.34 A: right i- i'm like you i don't know if i would invent one i'm um course i'm not the most creative type of person so [laughter] i usually take what's given to me and and use it to the best of [laughter] best of my abilities but uh 

152.46 153.59 A: (( but yeah )) 

154.12 155.69 A: that's i i think 

155.70 160.95 A: um i think one of the reasons i enjoy christmas is 'cause our in our family it was 

161.22 167.03 A: it always promoted the same types of things that you were talking about with kwanza it's you know it's um 

162.73 164.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm mhm )) 

167.20 171.52 A: the idea of sharing and giving and we always had more fun 

171.71 180.85 A: uh discussing those ideas a- and um learning about those things and learning about the spirit of giving and about um considering others and ah 

181.17 182.99 A: know what christ did for us 

183.04 192.94 A: when he came to earth and and how that was the the greatest gift and the greatest consideration so i think probably for the same reasons that that you would create 

193.55 196.31 A: um the holiday you were thinking of 

196.46 199.14 A: would be the reasons that i enjoy christmas so much so but 

202.63 210.75 B: mhm mhm what about do you have any d- any specific traditions that you guys celebrate at christmas things that might be different from the the normal typical family mhm 

210.71 214.03 A: ah [sigh] you know i don't know if we do or not um 

215.89 221.95 A: it was always just family gatherings ah reading the christmas story um 

223.89 226.70 A: really pretty basic traditions 

226.66 227.45 B: mhm 

227.12 228.40 A: what about you 

227.79 229.67 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

230.59 240.40 B: no i don't think that we're any different than anybody else we kind of i know when i was growing up we had um you know extended family that we celebrated with and we had a um 

233.36 234.26 A: mhm 

240.32 248.46 B: a neighbor whose grandson um lived with them her daughter and grandson had moved back in with them after her after their marriage kinda went 

247.52 249.44 A: (( right uh-huh mhm yeah )) 

248.57 255.46 B: and um but the the son for some reason always spent christmas day with his father so they used we used to go down and share with them 

252.84 253.79 A: uh-huh 

255.39 257.28 B: for christmas eve 

256.29 258.05 A: oh that's neat yeah [laughter] 

257.18 268.17 B: 'cause they opened their gifts so then we started the tradition of coming home and opening all of our gifts on christmas eve and it was kinda right when my sister and i were right at the age we were still really into the gifts we would wake up early [laughter] 

265.84 266.89 A: uh-huh 

267.54 268.72 A: (( uh-huh )) 

268.04 278.16 B: so my parents kinda got out of the waking up early by letting us opening the gifts on christmas eve but it always extended into christmas day anyway you know it was technically you know after midnight so so 

270.46 273.80 A: [laughter] [laughter] hey that worked [laughter] 

277.12 278.15 A: uh-huh 

278.34 288.76 A: but w- we always did ah my father grew up opening gifts on christmas eve santa claus would come during um the christmas meal on christmas eve 

288.67 297.92 A: was was their tradition and so they would finish eating and then they'd get up and all go gather round the tree well my mother grew up that you know uh 

288.83 290.50 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

298.03 300.79 A: as a child santa claus would come for her 

301.03 302.08 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

301.05 315.55 A: christmas eve night while they were all asleep and so ah when they got married they just kind of combined both traditions so we would open um family gifts on christmas eve and then or we would pick one gift on christmas eve and then christmas morning 

315.19 316.81 B: (( [noise] right )) 

315.60 317.82 A: we would open the rest so 

316.84 326.62 B: right right and that's i think that's what we did traditionally up until then up until the time that we you know started doing this as a family is we got one on christmas eve [laughter] 

320.94 321.97 A: (( uh huh )) 

324.50 325.57 A: (( right )) 

325.67 328.10 A: right [laughter] that's 

328.12 330.19 A: i tell you this year i had um 

330.58 336.78 A: i have one daughter and she's just to the age right now where she was starting to really 

336.56 347.75 A: um enjoy christmas and really get into gifts and so this year it was it was very tempting to just let her dig into all of them [laughter] christmas eve but but we didn't we waited till christmas morning but ah [mn] 

343.35 344.33 B: (( [noise] i bet )) 

347.36 348.49 B: how old is she 

348.29 350.96 A: she she will be two in may 

350.71 353.25 B: oh okay so yeah that'll that's a good age 

352.86 355.15 A: mhm you said you had kids 

354.99 356.22 B: yeah i have one son 

355.89 358.29 A: one son how old is he 

357.42 359.24 B: he's just a year old 

358.58 360.58 A: oh how precious 

359.43 365.95 B: yeah so christmas was fun this year but he didn't really know why he was getting you know it's like what is all this [laughter] 

362.23 363.31 A: (( uh-huh )) 

365.01 373.31 A: that's [laughter] right that's the way my daughter was last year she just wasn't quite sure [laughter] but this year she was a little overwhelmed 

369.56 370.56 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

373.58 383.90 A: with everything i mean she was just surrounded by wrapping paper and toys and she had to get it all cleaned up and tidied before she could really enjoy it but 

382.91 385.58 B: (( mhm oh [laughter] [noise] )) 

383.91 387.85 A: [laughter] but it was neat to watch her she's she had fun 

387.27 388.01 B: (( that's )) 

388.87 390.37 B: good 

389.24 390.61 A: oh [laughter] 

391.89 393.36 A: was that your son 

392.97 394.92 B: yes [laughter] 

393.52 395.19 A: oh how precious 

395.55 398.32 B: yep he's e- trying to get into all the cookies here 

397.77 400.61 A: [laughter] sounds like my daughter 

400.20 403.65 B: mhm and now i see cookie hand prints all over the furniture 

403.13 405.43 A: [laughter] oh no [laughter] 

405.83 406.92 A: oh 

406.78 413.50 B: [noise] but we were thinking this year about what different things what things are we gonna you know traditions are we gonna create for for our family now 

412.06 414.02 A: right mhm 

414.49 417.17 A: did you have you decided on anything yet or 

416.46 426.64 B: no not yet it's kind of it's kind of silly you know we we have so ma- so many other family obligations already it's kinda like well we have to go here with my parents and then we have to do this with your parents 

422.28 423.71 A: right 

426.39 427.65 A: right 

426.95 429.66 B: so we didn't get anything original in 

429.50 433.43 A: mhm [laughter] well that's one thing that we established um 

433.39 443.40 A: over the past year was we live quite a ways away from both sets of my parents i i mean both sets of our parents um my in laws live about eight hours away and my um 

443.30 449.68 A: my parents actually are missionaries and live half way round the world so we don't get together with them much um 

443.34 444.98 B: (( this year [laughter] )) 

448.85 451.08 B: mhm 

450.29 456.29 A: and so for u- for the actual christmas celebrations we decided that we were just going to 

456.45 459.67 A: always stay home christmas eve and christmas day 

459.60 473.14 A: and then try to visit if if it was possible try to visit before and after christmas you know make sure we visited thanksgiving or or do a new year's visit or something like that so that's that's one thing we established 

473.19 481.10 A: you know we just told our families you live too far away just [laughter] sorry but we'll try to do it another time [laughter] 

479.91 487.38 B: [noise] [noise] right and that's one thing my mother said and she's always so opinionated it's funny the things that she says well we will not do that 

483.98 485.20 A: mhm 

486.76 488.19 A: right [laughter] 

487.68 488.71 B: but she says 

489.03 498.01 B: [lipsmack] you know this christmas it's okay if you go somewh- you know go visiting for christmas but from now on christmas has he has to wake up in his own bed on christmas [laughter] 

496.68 498.73 A: oh [laughter] 

498.23 507.50 B: okay mom [laughter] so she's like you don't ever have to come to my house don't think it's an obligation [laughter] you can tell she's kinda like and don't you go to the in laws either [laughter] [laughter] 

501.73 504.30 A: [laughter] 

505.95 513.09 A: right [laughter] if you're not gonna come here don't go anywhere else [laughter] oh goodness [laughter] 

508.44 510.26 B: [laughter] right 

512.63 515.75 B: 'cause every kid should wake up in his own bed on christmas morning 

515.34 522.43 A: [laughter] that sounds like something my grandmother in law would say she's very opinionated too and she- she'd tell you the way it is 

521.91 523.74 B: yeah [laughter] this 

522.59 525.06 A: [laughter] oh goodness [laughter] 

524.13 525.98 B: is how it should be [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] 

525.34 527.22 A: mhm [laughter] 

527.96 528.84 A: (( oh )) 

528.96 530.36 A: well christmas is 

530.54 532.43 A: christmas is quite a fun 

532.63 534.89 A: time to be at home i think 

535.12 538.41 A: you know we did when i was growing up um 

538.51 549.79 A: well i grew up overseas but whenever we were in the states we would always do christmas eve at at ah one set of grandparents and christmas day at the other set and we were always going going going and 

550.13 553.97 A: i didn't like it i remember even as a child i didn't like it 

554.24 557.69 A: but so i think that's one of the things that has really made me 

558.63 562.14 A: agree to wanting to just stay home those two things [laughter] 

561.40 562.79 B: (( mhm [noise] right )) 

562.32 571.24 A: but and also the opportunity you know if if our local church does have anything you know the opportunity to be able to be there for it and but 

572.27 575.24 A: yeah i- i've always been a homebody though 

575.64 576.98 A: prefer being at home 

578.03 588.56 B: mhm yeah that's ni- it's nice too to be able to especially when people work and every everybody's busy during the year it's nice to at christmas time most people are you know most companies and everything give you the time off 

581.53 582.36 A: (( so mm mhm )) 

588.34 593.98 B: so it's nice to just sit and and be with your family than anywhere else to be it's a good idea mhm 

591.00 592.13 A: it is 

592.46 593.54 A: it is 

593.65 594.63 A: (( mm )) 

595.04 599.89 A: ah you know we en- we enjoy our extended families very very much but ah
