36.16 36.63 A: yeah 

36.85 37.97 B: i spend more time on the

39.96 40.89 A: oh that sounds like me

62.83 64.12 B: oh that's fine i understand 

63.52 64.44 A: um 

65.17 66.37 A: and um 

66.68 77.53 A: yeah my mother had it on and so you know i kind of got sucked in right at the end and and then i wanted to see the last one just -cause i wanted to see the reaction when he revealed 

71.45 72.21 B: uh-huh 

78.42 79.76 A: that he wasn't a millionaire 

80.55 82.21 B: and how did that go 

81.96 83.56 A: um it was a lot 

83.73 89.38 A: easier than i thought it would be i thought you know that the women would be horrified or angry or 

90.43 92.15 A: reject him but really 

92.86 95.24 A: um the the woman he picked was was 

104.93 112.84 A: and uh it was funny her reaction was that well i was kind of put off that you were a millionaire anyway so this works out so 

111.28 111.75 B: right 

113.09 113.51 B: huh 

113.98 115.12 B: so did she wind up staying with him 

115.13 118.17 A: well they were forbidden to see each other 

118.78 121.28 A: for the following two months until the show aired 

122.94 123.61 B: wow 

130.68 132.37 A: so at this point they are still 

132.52 137.49 A: you know kind of together they are they are at the point where they are going to explore their relationship 

138.32 141.26 A: honestly i don't think it will work 

140.77 145.48 B: well my my oldest daughter got into it really really hard she is fourteen 

145.49 146.52 A: oh yeah 

146.14 154.34 B: and she kept trying to talk me into watching it and i was like no i really you know i really don't want to so 

154.74 155.27 A: yeah 

155.56 156.61 B: but the survivor 

155.79 156.35 A: well i didn't 

156.77 158.48 A: i didn't even want to watch survivor 

156.81 157.67 B: survivor 

159.22 160.58 A: um but uh uh 

160.05 160.98 B: i'm only 

161.53 167.15 A: i got sucked in at the end because i started realizing there was a psychological game going on 

167.49 168.24 B: uh-huh 

168.02 169.61 A: and that intrigued me 

171.20 173.74 B: well do you watch things like um 

174.49 176.93 B: uh i i don't know if this would be one of those 

177.07 178.99 B: programs that they are talking about um 

179.67 180.42 B: american idol 

181.27 182.93 A: i didn't watch that no 

184.01 185.05 A: it didn't interest me 

185.56 186.81 B: it didn't interest you 

186.49 187.08 A: no 

187.86 192.43 A: the the music wasn't really my kind of music i think it was more 

192.75 193.09 A: um 

193.39 195.05 A: mainstream and 

195.47 198.80 A: i don't i don't know uh to me it was a competition for 

199.26 203.84 A: a it was a talent competition and that didn't interest me any 

204.56 205.03 B: huh 

205.64 207.78 A: i watched big brother 

208.64 209.50 A: the very first one 

208.70 209.57 B: there's 

211.03 213.60 B: there's a new one coming out um 

215.32 216.73 B: married by america 

216.52 218.43 A: married by america yeah 

218.10 220.53 B: have you have you seen advertisements for that one 

219.86 224.14 A: yeah yeah i've seen the ads it seems silly to me 

224.13 225.84 B: so it doesn't interest you 

224.92 225.42 A: but 

234.25 236.07 A: any of these relationships it's 

236.51 238.69 A: it's more of a spectacle than anything 

239.06 247.05 B: well that's the way i feel i i feel it's more of a spectacle almost like they are being paid for it because i can't imagine myself going on national t._v. and having to deal with something like this 

247.33 248.78 A: right well plus 

248.17 248.77 B: i mean 

249.06 259.17 A: it's it's kind of like okay we'll pay you you know a couple thousand dollars to uh marry a stranger and of course you can always have it annulled later so it's 

257.92 258.34 B: right 

259.67 261.81 B: do you watch anything like fear factor 

262.21 263.31 A: no i don't 

264.69 266.94 A: but i've seen some out takes from it 

267.49 272.20 B: oh fear factor kind of interests me because it's more along the lines of actual reality 

272.23 273.17 A: yeah 

273.99 276.48 B: verses anything else so 

275.42 277.80 A: yeah that's true it's a 

279.20 279.85 A: it's a 

279.97 281.86 A: what what i saw was pretty gross 

284.95 285.93 B: uh 

285.22 287.07 A: to be eating eating the worms that 

287.54 288.29 A: squirted and 

289.54 290.34 A: uh 

290.66 294.03 A: digging for uh things in a bag of cow blood 

294.58 295.45 B: right 

295.12 295.56 A: yeah 

295.73 296.11 A: but 

295.78 297.74 B: well it's 

297.87 298.25 B: i 

298.61 302.05 B: i don't know i find it more interesting than things like joe millionaire of course 

303.38 307.05 B: i would i would have a hard time going on t._v. and pretending i was 

307.55 308.37 B: a millionaire 

308.55 312.44 B: just to see if i could get somebody to marry me and then turn around and have to betray -em i mean that's 

312.69 313.19 A: yeah 

313.23 314.43 B: that that would be rough 

314.63 317.26 B: it would it would be rough for me 

314.73 315.19 A: yeah 

316.92 318.72 A: but but the guy who did it was broke 

319.56 319.99 A: so 

320.10 322.64 A: it was it's a job and it's for money 

326.57 328.29 B: have you done things like this before 

330.16 333.33 A: reality t._v. no

371.07 371.90 A: oh 

372.63 373.55 A: but 

373.53 376.73 B: so i'm i'm not exactly sure what to expect from this 

376.85 380.11 B: i mean so you you probably don't know any more about this than i do 

380.15 388.00 A: i don't either she just said that some of her friends you know they had all joined it and some of them ended up talking to each other so

390.99 391.91 A: signed up and 

392.99 397.26 A: thinking you know if if luck has it we'll end up talking to each other 

397.82 399.74 A: but talking to a stranger is okay 

400.03 402.03 A: especially since they give us these topics that are 

402.64 403.06 B: yeah 

403.32 404.38 A: workable
