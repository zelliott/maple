15.51 20.35 A: um well so do you have any ideas as to how we could prevent bio-terrorism 

22.57 24.07 B: get a different president 

24.81 25.43 A: uh 

26.03 35.56 A: that is an interesting one i was uh actually thinking of uh last year and the years before uh attacks through the mail uh the anthrax attacks to congress 

35.99 36.40 B: mhm 

36.28 38.82 A: um and all i could uh 

39.03 43.13 A: surmise was uh that all packages must actually be 

43.29 50.32 A: uh put in envelopes sealed at the post offices that's uh you know at least through the end of you know the current uh 

50.79 53.69 A: crisis uh was one of the things that i was thinking of 

53.83 57.48 B: but what if the anthrax is being deposited at the post office 

61.42 68.56 A: you know and part of the reasoning you know to do it at the post office is so that you know a postal worker you know actually was you know seeing the envelopes closed 

69.93 72.74 B: so like you would take your envelopes there and you would close it 

73.11 73.81 A: exactly 

73.16 74.61 B: in front of a postal worker 

74.67 75.34 A: exactly 

76.31 77.01 B: that is a good idea 

83.49 85.57 A: too but the alternative are the the 

86.01 97.64 A: back up uh behind uh businesses doing it with the you know perhaps they employed you know uh an agent at the post office or the the u._p._s. to work for them at their company 

97.89 98.35 B: right 

98.36 102.27 A: uh in an effort to you know help speed up the process a little bit 

103.59 104.66 B: that is a great idea 

103.61 104.17 A: uh 

104.79 109.55 A: it's beyond that you know i i think uh tighter borders um uh 

108.87 110.19 B: much tighter borders 

110.28 117.33 A: increased uh coast guard patrols along the coast because i think a lot of the stuff that comes into the united states does so without our knowledge 

117.77 119.34 A: uh on cargo ships 

119.61 120.00 B: right 

121.61 123.68 B: my the only 

121.78 122.61 A: u- um 

123.83 127.10 B: response to that is though is you know now they are saying 

127.56 129.84 B: that they don't have any more money to hire anymore 

130.27 132.86 B: border agents and those type of things so 

132.95 135.11 B: are we willing to pay more taxes to 

135.48 137.49 B: have more money to hire more agents 

157.63 159.75 A: um that can uh 

159.92 161.28 A: help regulate 

161.74 164.09 A: things coming in and out of of the uh 

164.86 166.30 A: uh of our coast 

167.29 168.27 B: but will the 

167.53 167.82 A: that 

168.37 171.27 B: yeah the other question with that though is will the government 

171.55 173.97 B: allow the military forces to 

174.68 176.34 B: help like on the borders 

177.47 178.79 B: you know being able to defend 

179.75 181.67 B: i mean are they going to pay them to 

182.42 184.56 B: be at the east and the west coast borders 

185.45 187.43 B: verses being in iraq or 

185.52 185.85 A: well 

187.86 194.76 A: okay and i i'm actually a veteran (( )) uh i spent six years in the army and my idea is that um 

188.07 189.70 B: places that they have them stationed 

194.88 199.35 A: in times of crises that uh the military pulls what is called you know just 

199.73 200.34 A: uh 

201.04 201.79 A: guard duty 

201.88 210.67 A: and uh you know all these people that are on all these posts along the seaboards just either man a guard post you know um 

212.12 214.72 A: you know i guess you know in a tower or something you know 

214.90 218.94 A: uh watching out for uh vessels coming in and out of harbors 

219.45 222.40 A: uh making sure that you know that their arrivals 

222.70 225.10 A: and departures are scheduled and uh 

226.15 227.18 A: just that and i mean 

227.57 231.87 A: first off that they are you know legitimate uh vessels coming in and out of the harbors 

232.06 232.47 B: right 

233.33 236.39 B: and do you think it is a wise thing that they've gone to this 

236.57 240.36 B: homeland security where they joined all the forces together as one 

240.76 243.58 B: verses having the separate c._i._a. and f._b._i. and 

244.35 245.43 A: i think that there's 

244.37 247.65 B: i think that's where a lot of them a lot more is going to come in too 

248.10 254.32 A: i think that they are still very much separate entities i think that uh they just share information to the point that uh 

254.60 255.84 A: they can um 

256.60 257.16 A: kind of 

257.59 259.60 A: cross lines or have um 

272.69 273.11 B: uh-huh 

272.81 281.32 A: and uh not until you know each of the three departments have each of the three pieces of information you know are they able to do anything with you know the 

281.45 284.45 A: information to to possibly prevent you know uh 

284.60 289.38 A: bio-terrorist attacks the other thing that that you know really intrigues me is you know 

290.23 293.64 A: the idea of all of you know the uh 

294.40 298.98 A: chemical weapons or biological weapons that uh is out there 

299.10 299.68 A: by 

299.86 301.85 A: sworn enemies of the united states 

302.39 303.39 A: um 

313.41 314.90 A: and uh prevent 

315.05 318.21 A: someone who you know who hates americans and who has you know 

318.59 320.93 A: put at least you know one uh 

321.18 321.62 A: uh 

322.62 323.00 A: uh 

323.41 331.35 A: hit man out to try and assassinate a former president you know i i think someone who has you know shown his colors you know needs to be 

331.90 332.38 A: uh 

332.54 339.65 A: really put in check and i i know that he has uh over i think it was a hundred thousand tons are of uh chemical weapons 

340.25 343.96 A: i'm not uh that's i think it was a hundred thousand pounds of chemical weapons 

341.55 344.35 B: and why do we but why do we keep playing with him 

344.82 345.33 A: i'm sorry 

345.40 347.98 B: why do we keep playing with him why are we still 

346.88 356.50 A: i don't think we are playing anymore i think we have uh a couple more of days before uh we take control of those chemical weapons biological weapons and destroy them as far as 

357.34 359.52 A: that goes i mean i i truly think it's it's 

359.63 360.62 A: just about over 

361.99 366.37 B: i just i hope that the playing is over now i hope they are finally serious and they are going to 

366.84 368.32 B: do something (( )) this time 

368.86 370.77 B: what was the last time we were over there and 

371.30 375.61 B: bombed them all up and now we are back over there again if they would have done something with him the first time 

376.89 379.33 B: i don't know i just have a different opinion about that 

380.03 383.34 A: well i think he will be removed from power this time as well as you know 
380.37 381.02 B: it seemed 

383.46 388.12 A: all of the the missing weapons or the biological weapons or the chemical weapons will be taken 

389.00 390.49 B: you think they will be found this time 

390.79 394.72 A: oh i know so i think that uh the military will actually just 

395.37 401.38 A: essentially start at one side of the coun- country and walk across to the other side until they you know know where everything is at 

401.88 404.73 B: but why didn't they do that the first time we were over there 

405.04 409.46 A: because the u._n. prevented uh bush from uh staying longer to remove hussein 

410.72 411.72 A: they made him back out 

412.24 415.26 B: and you think that this time with bush and 

415.67 417.74 B: with the son in office that he is going to 

417.47 421.13 A: i think we've already basically said that uh the u._n. is 

422.32 425.05 A: non-effective and uh not doing it's job 

425.87 426.86 B: i agree with that 

427.91 430.39 B: i just hope that this time they are finally serious and 

430.97 433.32 B: are going to do something with him getting out of power 

434.20 434.54 A: yeah 

435.15 435.67 B: is there a 

439.59 440.87 B: go against him that 

441.58 443.30 B: will become the person that 

443.87 447.38 B: saddam hussein thinks he is do you think that there is anyone that will stand up to him 

448.67 453.46 A: uh well i i think that we are now and then after we remove him then we will 

454.78 457.81 A: watch closely as to who steps into power after that 

459.99 462.43 B: and then do you think that is going to help the united states any 

462.59 465.77 A: i think that will help prevent uh possible 

476.42 478.66 A: in the world to terrorist organizations 

479.16 482.69 A: now uh you know there's probably still a great deal of 

494.12 494.79 A: but i think 

495.49 496.73 A: it it killed 

497.11 500.64 A: probably the largest existing supply of 

501.21 502.99 A: easily accessible or 

503.29 506.17 A: terrorist accessible biological or chemical weapons 

507.05 508.43 B: do then do you think 

508.86 512.87 B: while they are over there do you think they will also get osama bin laden while they are there too 

514.13 516.46 B: or do you think an end will be put to him also 

517.59 519.66 A: i think that his 

520.42 524.21 A: future is as of yet is uncertain but i think that they are
