8.32 9.10 B: i feel that 

9.86 10.98 B: uh heightened 

11.14 12.29 B: airport security 

13.66 14.61 B: can and can 

14.85 15.12 B: and 

15.27 17.35 B: can be a good thing can be a bad thing 

17.97 18.79 B: reason being 

19.20 20.82 B: a bad thing is that 

21.46 26.17 B: the people that does the security are in lower ranks they are lower paid 

26.39 27.11 B: individuals 

27.75 28.10 B: and 

28.75 30.94 B: what do they have this is (( )) do 

31.42 34.49 B: they getting paid less money than anybody in the airports 

34.69 35.28 B: basically 

35.68 37.01 B: just sit there and they get 

37.77 38.69 B: sit there and 

39.53 42.60 B: it's just monotonous to them so all the time they are sitting there 

43.10 43.52 B: it just 

43.96 45.94 B: h- hum (( )) so they don't know 

46.54 47.83 B: sometimes they might fall asleep 

48.01 49.23 B: sometimes they might feel 

49.75 50.28 B: depressed 

50.49 51.39 B: and they just might miss 

51.51 52.44 B: they end up paying 

54.37 58.82 A: i agree i also think there might be a strong element of racial profiling i believe that 

59.41 64.34 A: so many people from different ethnicities can easily get away with specific 

64.79 66.15 A: pass-bys i know 

66.32 68.81 A: i personally went down to florida uh 

69.09 71.09 A: the february after september eleventh 

71.51 72.74 A: for my sister's wedding 

73.19 75.31 A: and we actually had an indian 

75.71 77.02 A: person in our party 

77.23 87.17 A: and i was able to get through and my sister was able to get through and we as caucasians were completely fine but her indian friend who is completely americanized and 

87.40 94.16 A: as i know him is a great upstanding citizen was stopped so i think racial profiling is also a huge problem as well as the fact that 

94.77 102.84 A: what you were saying only an automated security device could work only metal detectors would work and there's always the problem that like people could mess up get lazy 

103.22 105.42 A: or be discriminatory against something 

105.75 110.54 A: i also think it's sort of a threat um have you been to any of the airports or seen any of the airports where they have 

111.08 111.83 A: armed guards 

112.02 112.65 A: because i don't 

113.43 114.81 A: think that encourages me 

114.92 116.19 A: to travel anymore 

115.25 118.20 B: i don't think that's a good point the armed guards uh 

118.31 118.77 B: at a 

119.12 120.18 B: airport because 

120.52 121.79 B: they give people fear 

122.06 122.85 B: of travel 

123.18 124.18 B: if people feel that 

124.49 125.49 B: they had to (( )) 

125.78 126.67 B: security is not 

126.80 127.85 B: so much to have people 

127.96 129.30 B: to have armed guards there 

129.90 131.76 B: and guns to scare you from flying 

132.32 132.81 B: and like 

133.29 134.83 B: you were saying just a moment ago 

135.47 135.89 B: with the 

136.97 137.49 B: (( )) 

137.64 139.52 B: disparity of the united states 

140.50 141.10 B: you can't 

141.45 147.52 B: just because one person because like in the oklahoma bombing everybody start to (( )) oversees them 

147.76 148.19 B: and it would 

148.35 149.96 B: somebody right here in the state that 

150.17 151.03 B: perpetrated this 

151.95 152.35 B: so 

152.66 153.63 B: by looking for a 

153.73 154.25 B: specific 

154.95 155.80 B: uh ethnic 

156.06 156.48 B: or 

156.83 157.44 B: racial 

157.87 158.38 B: person 

158.99 160.32 B: you going to miss a whole of stuff 

160.64 161.10 B: and like 

161.90 163.09 B: racial profiling 

163.85 166.00 B: you don't know who the terrorist is that day because 

166.41 168.08 B: uh united states is a melting pot 

168.52 169.60 B: there's so many cultures 

170.06 172.45 B: and there's so many people in this world now that 

173.07 177.22 B: have good feelings for the united states and want to come to the united states because it is a land of opportunity 

177.62 178.14 B: and then 

178.71 180.51 B: by being in the military and being retired 

181.01 184.09 B: there's a lot of people all over the world that have a bad taste 

184.26 185.09 B: in mouth but 

185.28 186.39 B: united states because 

187.66 188.41 B: they feel that 

188.59 189.06 B: we are 

189.37 191.35 B: got so much privileged over here and they want 

191.45 193.03 B: to get some of the same thing we have 

195.47 198.30 A: i agree i also think there's a big problem with the fact that 

198.87 201.14 A: airports are such frequently traveled 

201.23 203.76 A: to places not even getting on the plane 

204.19 208.07 A: but if you think about how many people are actually at the airport at any given day 

208.26 213.44 A: a person doesn't need to get in to a plane or onto a plane all they need to do is pass through the gates and they are 

213.84 216.25 A: running the risk of so many people's lives if they have 

216.68 218.42 A: a bomb or any sort of 

219.09 224.24 A: chemical or germ warfare that they could potentially unleash upon all of these people i know that sounds 

224.74 228.26 A: more like a conspiracy theory than anything compared to logic but 

228.69 229.29 A: you now it 

229.48 231.10 A: it's still a possibility and i think 

231.30 235.77 A: if we are going to heighten security it needs to be heightened security at public places not so much 

236.12 238.31 A: on the entry way to the flight itself 

238.90 239.41 A: um 

240.21 241.38 A: but again i think 

241.70 243.89 A: there is so much fault in that because you can't 

245.10 249.96 A: it's difficult to find somebody that trustworthy to run that sort of a job and i'm sure it would cost 

250.59 253.39 A: millions of dollars to come up with the technology that would 

253.82 260.38 A: be as impenetrable as we as a country would need to be to make it effective so i definitely don't think that the heightened security 

261.12 262.08 A: increases any 

262.85 264.92 A: feeling of safety at least for me 

264.39 265.67 B: i don't think though you need to be 

266.06 266.59 B: because 

267.51 268.00 B: it's not 

268.76 269.67 B: not who 

270.14 271.13 B: who has access 

271.27 272.13 B: to get on the plane 

272.43 274.45 B: like everybody has access to airports 

274.92 275.24 B: like 

275.85 276.35 B: somebody 

276.64 277.89 B: all the time that people 

278.27 280.00 B: are being screened when they are getting on planes 

280.38 283.76 B: what about all the other p- other other places in the airports 

284.06 288.67 B: there's a lot of places in the airport that all you have to do is be a mem- be an individual to get on there 

288.81 291.48 B: and you can go to any place in the airport except for 

292.13 293.19 B: going in to where the 

293.78 295.37 B: the bag- the baggage are 

295.56 296.30 B: pick up baggage 

296.71 297.11 B: or 

297.29 298.65 B: going on to the plane itself 

299.54 300.30 B: and like you said 

300.74 302.32 B: somebody could put something in a bag 

302.88 304.42 B: while somebody is standing next to it 

305.21 306.28 B: at a turn stall 

306.84 309.08 B: and waiting for it to get on bo- on board or 

309.29 311.31 B: or standing on line just push some (( )) on 

311.71 312.73 B: on baggage or something 

313.54 314.21 B: and that could 

314.34 317.17 B: effect the other people in there i know the baggage is down in 

318.41 319.44 B: eh down in the uh 

320.06 321.06 B: in the baggage compartment 

321.29 321.63 B: but 

321.90 323.95 B: somebody could carry something on the plane because 

325.02 327.23 B: eh you ca- (( )) called terrorism in 

327.52 328.81 B: you could get people on there 

329.21 330.05 B: who just have 

330.43 331.62 B: they are willing to die 

332.41 334.09 B: for the people that they are supporting 

334.29 335.42 B: and for their beliefs 

335.84 336.24 B: so 

336.46 338.05 B: somebody could to carry on bag 

338.29 340.19 B: and don't have to be a bomb but it could be a 

340.48 341.23 B: some type of 

343.03 343.42 B: of 

344.17 344.85 B: chemical 

345.09 348.21 B: or biological agent on there that could bring the plane down 

351.28 352.25 A: and i don't think it's just 

352.41 355.28 A: at airports either i know our topic is airports but 

355.46 358.16 A: any mass transport is some sort of way that people can 

358.62 359.06 A: you know 

359.45 363.34 A: come in contact with a terrorist it doesn't have to just be a plane if they are going to 

363.64 364.76 A: heighten security 

365.14 368.92 A: on any entry or exit way from a place then you are going to have to do that 

369.18 375.35 A: city boundaries state boundaries subway stations train stations i mean they can't just limit it to airports that's 

376.03 378.47 A: sort of a narrow scope and i know they are thinking about the 

389.60 391.49 A: that our nation has the money to do that 

397.84 398.77 A: accurate or more 

399.42 401.26 A: sensible defense systems um 

401.44 402.48 A: especially what was 

402.76 405.56 A: bush saying that he wants to declare his war on terrorism 

406.08 409.97 A: so i really don't know what kind of legislation they could actually pass to make 

410.37 412.70 A: airport security or any mass transit to put 

413.02 413.85 A: security more 

414.34 415.76 A: effective and a lot more 

416.08 417.39 A: uh even just more safe 

417.56 419.86 A: feeling -cause i know i personally don't feel safe 

420.80 423.14 A: if i see an armed guard at an airport or if i 

423.91 424.93 A: you know feel like 

425.43 426.25 A: they've heightened 

426.57 427.08 A: the 

427.20 428.66 A: the safety personnel's 

428.84 430.86 A: staff numbers because they are still 

430.96 432.56 A: subjective individuals who 

432.85 435.74 A: have their own opinion about who could or could not be a terrorist 

436.30 436.91 A: and 

437.61 439.81 A: it's just a really scary dangerous time 

439.50 439.86 B: yeah but 

440.30 441.44 B: um getting back to 

441.66 442.97 B: my original thought was 

443.46 444.33 B: you know like 

445.06 446.50 B: the people in the front office 

446.97 449.00 B: and the people who work upstairs and 

449.32 449.90 B: didn't make any 

450.23 452.45 B: one two hundred thousand dollars a year for 

452.86 457.27 B: running the airline and then you have the people down there that are doing the job they be making 

458.22 459.61 B: just above minimum wage 

459.98 460.80 B: uh sitting there 

461.17 463.04 B: trying to screen all the stuff looking through the 

463.73 466.30 B: they don't have an invested interest in what is going on 

467.08 467.45 B: so 

467.70 468.04 B: they g- 

468.42 470.61 B: most of them never been on a plane in like all their 

470.97 472.22 B: having a job that they'd 

472.79 473.45 B: (( )) there 

473.73 474.25 B: watching 

474.80 475.63 B: watching for 

476.06 478.06 B: metal items in the bags they check for 

478.28 480.39 B: metal metal item in a bag (( )) 

480.84 481.74 B: every now and then 

482.14 482.42 B: but 

482.76 484.82 B: how many things get by that they don't see 

485.77 486.45 B: so they 

486.65 489.00 B: they don't have an invested interest in them because of 

489.25 490.87 B: way difference between 

491.09 492.03 B: the top dog 

492.54 494.87 B: and the people who actually do the work down on the ground 

495.43 495.80 B: so 

495.95 496.94 B: if you tell me that 

497.37 500.40 B: somebody in the front office is making two hundred thousand dollars a year 

500.96 502.96 B: and here i am just barely making more 

503.14 505.43 B: than minimum wage making ten dollars an hour 

506.03 510.49 B: and you tell me i got as much invested in my job as you got invested in your job 

511.18 511.54 B: and it's 

511.86 513.52 B: just way disparity 

514.64 515.84 B: that the people don't see 

516.07 516.36 B: like 

516.61 518.34 B: if you have somebody down there making 

518.72 519.06 B: (( )) 

519.43 520.73 B: fifteen to twenty dollars an hour 

521.03 521.70 B: they are going to take 

521.80 523.61 B: they are going to do a better job there because 

523.73 525.24 B: more money you pay somebody 

525.45 527.58 B: the better job and the better conditions are 

527.89 528.94 B: but if you tell somebody 

529.06 530.81 B: you are going to get minimum wage instead of (( )) 

531.11 532.38 B: and screen for 

532.80 535.64 B: weapons for a bomb going on a plane 

536.35 539.98 B: they are going to (( )) with a grain of salt and say well i'm not flying on a plane no way so 

540.44 541.81 B: it really don't bother me
