229.13 230.65 B: (( ha well that's )) 

230.77 233.97 B: it's interesting how they grab from all these different places 

233.65 240.94 A: yeah i was just wondering 'cause maybe you get different shows than i get but i guess these are all nation wide shows 

240.24 241.78 B: [laughter] i think so 

242.16 244.10 B: i think so because 

244.67 248.28 B: [mn] this is ah the first time i stayed on hold quite a while 

248.35 251.73 B: waiting for waiting for them to find me another caller 

251.48 253.31 A: oh and they didn't find one 

252.75 254.30 B: they didn't find one 

254.30 255.58 A: huh that's 

254.78 257.29 B: and then this time it was quite a bit quicker 

256.93 270.08 A: i think they called me over here tonight because i had a message i think my son had wrote well ah my kids are older they're in college and i saw a note [mn] note that he had written with a one eight hundred number and it said 

264.37 265.40 B: right 

270.19 272.50 A: forget the name of this study we're doing 

272.18 273.09 B: right 

272.77 279.47 A: and it had that on there and i said oh i missed my call so maybe you was holding for me [laughter] 

278.49 281.56 B: no it's automated no no it's 

281.64 284.60 B: [sigh] i think they just start trying to call and 

284.52 286.24 A: and whoever they get 

285.68 287.83 B: right right so 

287.56 290.34 A: so where'd you find out about this study at 

289.89 292.42 B: i found out about it on um 

292.91 295.26 B: [lipsmack] on one of the mystery shopping 

295.00 297.08 A: that's where i found out about it 

296.43 298.25 B: exactly so w- 

297.18 299.54 A: so you do the same thing [laughter] 

298.94 306.08 B: yeah i just started i just started not too long ago so and i thought i thought well why not sign up 

305.86 312.44 A: i figured it doesn't hurt if [mn] if you don't get paid you [mn] you know if you do it's good 

312.61 314.99 B: yeah and if you don't you're not out anything 

313.36 316.71 A: if you don't you've wasted ten minutes of your time that's all 

316.48 318.60 B: yeah really so 

317.96 324.18 A: but i saw it on the same place i've been doing that type of shopping for about two years now so 

323.56 325.54 B: oh really do you stay busy 

325.57 333.02 A: not really it's not that much around here i sometime i can get anywhere between twenty and forty a month 

332.87 336.55 B: oh that's quite a few i work a full time job so i don't work 

335.80 345.60 A: oh i work full time too but i but see i i have to drive a long ways to get to work so i try to get something that i can just stop on on the way home 

346.13 348.23 B: oh that would be perfect 

348.17 352.60 A: so i'm not [mn] so i'm not going out just to do that 

351.87 355.49 B: right ri- yeah if you were going just to do it you couldn't 

354.87 357.94 A: [mn] if to me it wouldn't be worth it anyway 

357.50 360.70 B: they need to make a reality show about mystery shoppers 

360.07 362.02 A: yeah that would interes- [laughter] 

361.24 362.68 B: wouldn't it be funny 

362.70 364.35 B: it would be so funny 

363.22 364.02 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

364.11 367.65 A: 'cause that's what we're supposed to be talking 'bout anyway [laughter] 

367.08 371.98 B: yeah yeah [laughter] we can talk about how funny that would be 

372.26 377.02 B: [laughter] i know mine would be because i feel like inspector gadget when i go in 

377.26 381.80 B: [laughter] i'm hiding behind this and looking out behind that and 

380.88 383.64 A: [laughter] es- especially the grocery stores oh 

383.31 391.74 B: i haven't done a grocery store yet there haven't been any offered in my area but i've heard that those are pretty good but they're rather in depth 

391.14 395.10 A: they they're good 'cause you gotta go shopping anyway but 

394.77 396.93 B: right i've done a co- 

395.90 400.73 A: but to try to get all those names [mn] i have trouble reading name tags 

400.11 403.03 B: oh well let me tell you i did a casino 

403.15 404.80 B: my goodness 

403.40 406.13 A: oh that must have been interesting mm 

405.62 410.98 B: it was interesting but i- like i say it was it was very very difficult 

411.05 419.67 B: and you had to have eight different names [mn] and ah the only place you can write anything down is in the bathroom in the stall 

419.71 420.74 A: oh 

420.55 430.84 B: i'm telling you it'd make the perfect t._v. show it'd be a comedy it would be a comedy because [laughter] i was run- i bet i went to the bathroom sixteen times for eight different names 

423.12 424.98 A: (( [laughter] yeah it would be )) 

428.68 431.19 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

431.09 437.96 B: but i mean it paid unbelievably well i mean it was ninety dollars for about an hour and a half 

434.56 435.36 A: oh 

435.82 436.51 A: (( i- )) 

437.45 439.30 A: and where was it at 

438.64 440.72 B: it was in metropolis illinois 

440.70 442.82 A: oh they [mn] gamble out there 

441.57 443.77 B: they have one of the boats right 

443.02 444.68 A: oh on the boats 

444.06 444.99 B: right 

445.78 448.07 A: tha- i bet that was interesting 

447.62 449.83 B: it was it was so 

450.15 459.17 B: i liked it quite a bit and then i did one of the carpet cleaning shops in the house you know where it's just the reimbursement but i needed the i needed the carpet cleaning anyhow 

455.71 456.95 A: oh i haven't 

458.87 461.26 A: yeah and if they come into your house 

460.67 464.22 B: it was wonderful it was wonderful that was through sears 

464.36 466.41 A: (( oh i would [mn] [laughter] )) 

465.11 471.92 B: but that guy showed up [mn] like i say here we have another comedy that guy showed up and in my paper work it said that it'd be two people 

472.00 476.22 B: and that i wouldn't have to do anything this man showed up by himself 

477.13 480.02 B: and then they are not supposed to dump the waste water 

480.07 482.06 B: and he dumped it right out on the driveway 

482.05 482.90 A: oh 

482.72 489.43 B: oh i'm telling you i mean he did a really good job and we live on a farm so it wasn't a huge big deal but 

489.73 490.88 B: (( still )) 

490.45 493.73 A: it's just the idea if they're not supposed to do it 

493.13 497.01 B: right and you know and you know what they are and aren't supposed to do 

497.05 501.35 B: before they ever get here you know because you've got the insider information 

501.05 502.31 A: yeah 

501.99 503.09 B: and so 

503.11 511.29 A: well well the grocery stores are a little easier because you've got to write a shopping list anyway you can pretend you're writing your shopping list [laughter] 

503.20 503.76 B: (( [mn] )) 

510.11 512.30 B: oh that would be good 

511.62 514.00 A: so i- that he- that helps out 

513.70 516.62 B: i've seen some winn-dixies you know 

515.97 517.83 A: yeah those are the ones i use 

517.42 522.15 B: see we don't have any winn-dixies up here not not in my end of the state 

519.64 520.92 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

522.38 524.37 B: so that kind of puts me 

525.10 527.37 B: that kind of puts me in a bind there 

528.44 529.42 B: but uh 

529.31 533.72 A: i guess we better get on topic [laughter] before they cut us off 

533.61 536.66 B: no doubt now what else can we say about it 

536.04 541.45 A: well it would be g- a good reality show to do the mystery shopping 

539.51 540.72 B: it would be 

541.05 541.92 B: (( it would )) 

542.26 546.14 B: because i would be more than happy to be on the cast 

546.45 547.39 A: [laughter] me too 

547.27 550.09 B: [laughter] especially if it paid 

550.28 551.32 A: yeah 

550.68 552.28 B: [sigh] so 

552.18 556.52 A: well actually i just came back from doing one at a restaurant with my son 

556.68 560.18 A: [mn] and [mn] i've only been back home for about five minutes 

559.90 561.30 B: oh no 

560.47 563.26 A: [laughter] so i got lucky to get this call 

562.90 566.20 B: well let me tell you if you don't answer they call every hour 

566.40 569.02 A: oh i'm glad i answered this [noise] 

568.06 573.24 B: [laughter] i went ahead and i thought well there's nobody to talk on this topic tonight because 

573.50 580.84 B: i- it- it's not a reality t._v. to me doesn't appeal to anybody much over the age of twenty 

580.46 584.28 A: [mn] it it doesn't appeal to me at all really 

581.10 581.73 B: (( so )) 

583.77 589.09 B: [noise] it doesn't me either i'm you know i see it like i say i'm at home and i'm kinda trapped here now 

589.71 594.37 B: because my daughter's so little and we've had such cold weather but i'm twenty eight 

594.42 599.89 B: and still i'm not that interested in it i watch it and i think why why is so much app-
