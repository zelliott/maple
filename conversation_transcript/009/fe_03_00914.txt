406.44 409.23 B: it's called a mug logging trailers it's like a 

408.08 409.92 A: mug logging trailer 

410.24 410.54 B: yeah 

411.10 414.40 B: uh pretty much what it is is it's uh it it's like it's a trailer 

414.60 416.61 B: filled with a whole bunch of cens- censors 

417.70 420.76 B: that uh what they can do is that uh when they're drilling 

421.19 425.74 B: they put these you know put these devices to you know uh and uh wires down 

425.91 429.17 B: to check to make sure that there is no you know deadly gases or 

429.35 430.42 B: pocket gases 

430.80 432.17 B: of you know a certain 

432.40 433.77 B: you know gas is because 

434.25 436.69 B: i think what was it there was like one particular 

436.93 438.54 B: type of gases that was 

439.14 440.85 B: really common 

441.16 441.62 B: with 

442.01 442.92 B: pumping oil 

443.29 443.69 A: huh 

443.34 444.00 B: and 

444.15 447.35 B: if and if you uh pretty much if you start smelling 

447.46 448.11 B: rotten eggs 

448.39 450.63 B: you're dead 

449.66 450.33 A: wow 

450.84 455.64 A: so when you say a trailer you mean like a tractor trailer you mean like the a big large 

450.95 451.51 B: so 

455.83 457.63 A: uh rectangular vehicle 

458.41 465.72 B: uh well ye- yeah it wasn't really a veh- you know you know it wasn't really a it was just a regular trailer you know back then it was just you know you hitched it up 

465.12 465.61 A: i see 

466.11 472.13 B: you just hitched it up on your your truck and then you went to uh went to uh went to your site and then of course what you would do is the same 

472.36 475.67 B: you would link up the uh sensory stuff to the uh the sensory panel 

475.99 478.35 B: on the uh trailer and then uh 

478.55 485.46 B: instead of like you know um some of them have like you know little minute little you know bu- you know uh wind up chrome or 

485.64 486.63 B: i should say (( )) 

487.12 495.43 B: uh green and black screens way back when so you know it gave you like a little read out both most of it was actually done like 

490.30 490.61 A: huh 

495.80 498.38 B: through like you know a paper read out there is like a little like um 

499.06 503.33 B: oh gosh it's like a little richter scale looking thing that would go up and down up and down 

502.06 502.71 A: uh-huh 

503.57 504.18 B: and 

504.36 505.59 B: depending on those reading 

505.83 507.68 B: i had no idea cause i was too young 

507.97 513.81 B: you know it tell you if there is a large amount of gas there or not and that they would have to vent before anybody could work on it 

514.22 515.09 A: well i know are these 

515.38 517.39 A: trailers still in use 

518.48 519.45 B: um 

519.69 521.21 B: sort of kind of 

521.42 522.64 A: sort of kind of 

521.63 522.57 B: uh 

522.94 524.11 B: the reason be- 

523.03 524.22 A: it's kind of a technical answer 

524.63 529.14 B: reason being is because now eve- everything has gone so digital 

529.65 530.40 B: and so 

530.60 531.23 B: you know 

531.51 532.75 B: i guess you would say hand held 

533.18 536.77 B: i thi- uh if if i'm not mistaken a lot of the stuff that my dad did 

537.19 538.59 B: you know in the actual trailers 

538.88 539.59 B: is now 

539.92 544.36 B: you know you're able to have like something portable so you can just walk around 

543.33 544.34 A: now did he invent 

544.53 545.84 A: did he invent the 

546.42 549.98 A: the uh item or did he just modify something that was already in use 

550.80 553.74 B: uh i'm not really too sure um i believe um 

554.08 557.54 B: it was something already done he just uh sort of 

558.03 561.30 B: you know uh taken that same thing and you know improvised on it 

561.85 562.39 A: interesting 

561.97 562.55 B: well 

563.00 567.17 B: um but uh i think unfortunately i don't think there was a point where you could actually like 

567.28 569.77 B: you know have it patented or something like that you know what i mean 

570.29 573.09 A: so he's not an incredibly wealthy man based on his invention
