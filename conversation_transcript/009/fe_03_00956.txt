64.94 70.01 B: right well i noticed after september eleventh people weren't really getting out very much 

70.69 74.10 B: but i tried to counteract that and i tried to go out more 

75.02 79.15 B: cause i knew that people were afraid and that was the last thing that they wanted us to be was afraid 

79.31 82.40 A: right especially of flying flying was a big uh 

82.88 83.52 A: big issue 

84.08 86.04 B: right and the people that i work with they 

86.30 87.64 B: flew more actually 

87.55 88.74 A: they flew more 

88.84 91.06 B: uh-huh that was the way that we tried to 

91.37 92.20 B: counteract 

93.08 95.11 B: to say that we weren't really afraid 

101.61 103.06 A: what else uh what else have you done 

105.08 106.88 B: that is pretty much it um 

107.76 109.82 B: tell you i really haven't changed anything 

111.85 116.87 B: i mean it scared us all of course and i guess that made us really cautious about things but 

117.83 120.24 B: you know you really have to go on with your life 

120.93 122.42 A: yeah that is right you're exactly right 

121.99 122.45 B: and 

122.79 125.48 B: you know it could happen to anyone that 

125.99 127.01 B: then again 

127.72 128.35 B: you know it 

128.47 129.41 B: it killed 

130.04 132.24 B: so many people but then again there is 

132.63 134.42 B: a lot more in the world 

135.97 136.31 B: so 

138.52 141.15 A: i know when uh when the twin towers went down 

141.94 142.95 A: i was at work 

143.83 151.00 A: and then uh i work in columbus columbus ohio and uh you can hear that that they sent everyone home 

152.43 153.23 A: uh when this happened 

152.82 154.68 B: they actually made us stay at work 

154.75 156.23 A: did they they uh 

155.60 156.29 B: yeah i'm 

156.73 158.33 B: i'm close to atlanta georgia 

158.44 159.76 A: oh atlanta georgia mhm 

159.70 160.20 B: so 

160.63 165.08 B: they just made us all stay there i mean we really didn't get much work done but 

165.21 166.33 B: they said there way is 

166.61 168.70 B: handling it was that we had to stay there 

168.89 169.30 A: why 

170.09 170.43 B: so 

170.40 171.14 A: (( )) 

171.66 173.48 B: i was kind of glad though because 

176.10 178.62 B: i felt really safe where i was anyway 

179.51 180.94 B: you know and you never know 

181.54 184.03 A: right where uh where i worked was 

184.32 186.84 A: say say about two minutes from 

187.54 188.25 A: the uh 

189.10 190.04 A: major base 

191.05 192.16 A: and uh 

192.51 194.83 A: at at at that point that is where the (( )) send everyone home 

199.54 200.18 A: bomb the base 

200.80 203.33 B: oh yeah well they were afraid everywhere 

208.98 211.06 A: uh i know the uh and i went to the airport 

212.89 214.22 A: there was hardly anyone there 

214.61 215.23 A: at the airport 

216.15 216.94 B: i know 

216.85 218.65 A: like columbus columbus airport here 

220.85 221.37 A: well 

222.73 223.52 A: it is very 

223.85 226.10 A: vivid there has also been ve- very strict on uh 

227.78 230.77 A: on like get getti- getting past the the the detectors 

231.34 232.08 B: oh yeah 

232.44 234.20 A: and it piles around and 

235.36 236.88 A: you know the- the- there is a lot of uh 

237.52 238.68 A: (( )) well at least for here 

239.53 241.41 A: it just seems more more more like a hassle 

241.67 242.39 A: than anything 

242.82 244.32 A: and if you went anywhere it was 

243.17 243.64 B: kill 

245.21 247.20 A: it it was almost a lot like you was in you know 

248.23 251.19 A: uh the the the that is you you was the one that was bombing everything 

252.16 256.08 B: right but see the thing is they really didn't know at the time so 

255.57 255.94 A: right 

256.66 257.25 B: they had to 

257.46 258.16 B: pretty much 

258.48 259.99 B: think anyone was a suspect 

261.23 263.43 B: and anybody still could be a suspect 

263.71 264.90 A: oh sure sure 

264.62 265.48 B: you never know 

266.01 266.66 A: oh yeah 

270.79 272.83 B: but i almost think that they keep 

273.04 274.23 B: raising the threat 

274.63 275.47 B: warnings 

276.30 276.81 A: raising the 

276.38 277.28 B: and i think 

277.39 280.79 B: you know like we go to orange or red or 

279.99 280.94 A: oh yeah (( )) 

281.75 282.56 B: so 

282.77 284.78 B: i think that kind of makes people 

285.25 287.26 B: not as on guard as they should be 

288.89 290.37 A: right oh yes that is clear 

289.70 291.62 B: cause it keeps happening you know 

294.71 298.29 A: i've got some family that live lived in in new york they uh 

299.22 300.84 A: they just said it was total mess 

301.41 302.52 B: oh i bet 

302.42 303.49 A: total mess yeah 

304.20 306.79 B: can only imagine you know we just saw it on t._v. 

306.83 308.40 A: oh yeah exactly exactly 

308.22 310.49 B: so you can only imagine being there 

313.37 315.76 B: but it was a day that you will never forget 

315.62 318.44 A: oh but that is exactly you're exactly right exactly right 

319.50 319.96 A: um 

322.35 323.00 A: but uh 

323.55 327.87 A: there was a wh- in new york the ther- at (( )) call it's family and 

328.63 332.35 A: and (( )) every road was blocked off you couldn't go anywhere 

333.03 336.03 A: uh which which (( )) under- under- stan- -standable 

336.52 337.62 B: oh yeah of course 

337.08 337.33 A: yeah 

337.92 338.50 A: but uh 

339.41 342.04 A: visit thousands and thousands of people and 

343.63 345.05 B: and they never knew if they 

345.23 349.01 B: knew somebody that was end there or not until it was all over with 

349.36 350.58 A: oh yeah i'd be 

350.07 350.71 B: you know 

351.03 353.08 A: yes es- es- especially having to have uh 

353.54 354.91 A: have your name on the television 

355.92 358.81 A: you know with you know people that they that they found 

359.53 361.11 A: you know people that was okay 

361.48 362.33 B: mhm 

363.24 364.28 B: that was scary 

366.28 369.14 B: cause there were people from all over the world that were in that building 

369.25 370.39 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

371.03 371.78 A: yeah that is uh 

374.28 376.04 A: what this (( )) supposed to be uh 

376.53 377.84 A: re- re- re- rebuilding 

379.32 382.03 B: yeah um what was it they said they were going to put there 

382.72 384.34 B: oh i just heard it the other day 

385.00 388.79 B: it's not going to be anything in the magnitude of what it was to begin with 

389.26 391.95 A: oh no they they built that though oh many years ago 

392.80 395.10 B: so i'm really glad that they're going to rebuild there 

395.38 396.95 A: oh (( )) which they actually should 

397.15 397.67 A: they should 

397.51 398.30 B: oh yeah 

399.63 402.86 B: cause if we don't it only says to terrorists that hey 

399.65 400.29 A: (( )) 

404.32 406.47 B: we're not going to go on cause of you 

407.17 407.55 A: right 

407.89 409.15 B: well it kind of shows them 

413.18 414.74 A: this is kind it's going to get kind of weird isn't it 

415.25 416.23 B: yeah 

415.86 416.90 A: yeah it is 

416.64 418.58 B: cause i really don't know what else to say 

418.38 422.46 A: right yeah but it well you know there is only there is only so so much you can say about it 

418.73 419.12 B: fair 

423.01 426.34 A: you know without going like great great deep in to detail i mean 

426.56 427.78 B: yeah and 

426.84 429.74 A: and everyone they saw it as as they watched the te- television 

430.45 430.92 A: uh 

431.09 435.73 A: you know they saw the planes going in to the towers and the towers blo- blowing up and then 

435.91 437.12 A: then the towers falling 

439.40 440.01 A: (( )) 

439.49 440.85 B: if you look at it it it's 

440.96 442.29 B: still doesn't look real 

442.81 445.63 A: oh yeah the the the looks like something out of a movie 

445.92 448.18 B: yeah it looks like it was just filmed 

448.28 448.88 B: you know just 

449.25 450.62 B: for entertainment 

451.06 453.87 B: that is what we thought when we saw it we're like that is not real 

454.02 457.03 A: right well well what i don't understand is how how come they didn't um 

457.93 458.44 A: uh 

459.26 462.85 A: catch the planes before because the pla- the the planes went off course 

463.76 466.08 A: but but yet they they were just following the planes 

463.77 464.92 B: yeah but 

466.54 469.58 B: yeah but i i'm sure that happens everyday 

470.50 471.63 B: you know just like the 

472.27 473.07 B: the shuttle 

473.65 475.60 B: when they lost contact with that 

475.97 478.12 A: right yeah then yeah (( )) 

477.04 477.54 B: so 

478.10 480.27 B: and i'm you know that is a different story 

481.06 483.65 B: but i'm sure that it happens a lot 

484.51 490.66 B: and at the time our country was not really prepared for anything like that because we really hadn't had much terrorism 

492.31 494.67 B: but i really do think that the bombing 

496.00 498.99 B: that happened a few years before nine eleven 

499.99 501.01 B: was a sign that 

500.36 501.80 A: one that was in the uh 

501.11 502.44 B: of things that to come 

502.87 505.46 A: is that is th- that the one that was in the uh 

506.47 507.84 A: un parking garage 

507.09 507.70 B: the one 

507.92 509.93 B: the one that actually happened at 

510.26 511.38 B: the world trade center 

511.46 512.64 A: oh okay okay that one 

513.13 514.33 A: yeah that that was at the bottom 

513.20 513.79 B: yeah 

514.61 515.79 A: in the parking garage right 

516.22 518.07 B: yeah and that was a terrorist act too 

518.00 518.41 A: right 

520.53 523.78 B: so it's almost like that was a sign of things to to come 

524.38 526.03 A: oh exactly yeah oh yeah 

526.74 527.62 A: you know they uh 

530.16 533.99 A: i mean wh- when he (( )) that they should've had stricter guards 

534.52 535.48 A: yeah after that 

536.40 543.84 A: the the you know because because you know they're not going to stop the the at that point their actual goal was to blow it up from the bottom 

544.31 545.46 A: and then hope that it fell 

546.15 546.84 A: but it didn't 

547.45 548.71 A: something happened where it didn't 

549.58 552.48 A: uh th- i guess there was some beam if i remember right there was some 

553.13 555.41 A: something so some ou- outer outer support 

556.02 556.78 B: oh yeah 

556.98 557.95 A: yeah that uh 

557.39 559.17 B: just amazing at how 

559.33 562.99 B: more the planes hit it just made the entire thing crumble
