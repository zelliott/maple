96.15 97.78 B: third season of them right

98.07 98.99 B: (( is it for )) 

99.91 106.22 B: oh wow wow so this time they they've got the tribes separated out by the sexes right 

105.90 108.14 A: yes they do see you know a little bit 

106.96 107.46 B: and 

108.19 119.20 B: uh yeah yeah well i mean uh i i've never watched one consistently but i mean it's so inundated in in american television that it's impossible for me not to hear about it 

118.17 120.98 A: yeah so they are divided by men and women and 

121.23 122.23 A: i don't know 

121.49 121.91 B: uh huh 

122.88 124.00 B: are are you married 

123.99 124.65 A: yes i am 

124.86 128.12 B: uh are you two are are the two of you rooting for the separate tribes 

127.88 133.19 A: no because it seems pretty one sided we i mean it's hard to tell if the if the 

133.44 137.31 A: they do challenges or whatever it's pretty to tell if it's really 

135.11 135.62 B: mhm 

137.45 138.73 A: you know equal 

138.82 140.14 A: because they seem pretty easy 

140.66 142.13 A: or more geared towards the women 

142.79 144.67 A: so the women are winning more 

144.41 146.85 B: they you think the challenges are more geared towards women 

146.78 147.89 A: i think so 

148.38 150.37 B: i don't know the only one that i saw was 

150.60 155.72 B: uh i think the very first one i actually did watch that episode and uh 

155.88 160.27 B: it was the men were just dominating the whole thing the women got hung up on that um 

160.47 161.84 A: that uh like 

161.13 165.50 B: some sort of puzzle or yeah they had to decipher they had to use a 

162.12 162.91 A: yes 

165.63 172.35 B: uh deciphering ring to figure out what the code was so they could open up the bank and then go across the balancing beam thing 

171.45 173.82 A: right and the guy couldn't get across the beam 

173.49 179.99 B: oh my god i it was that was just frustrating for me to watch that guy screw up that bad 

178.64 181.08 A: i know could you imagine being that guy though 

181.55 189.08 B: did did he end up getting voted off i had to i had to leave before i saw the the full tribal council 

186.59 193.14 A: he didn't get it that he didn't get it that night but he he got it like last week or whatever he's finally gone yeah 

191.00 192.19 B: oh okay 

192.67 195.61 B: wow so so the girls tribe have they lost any 

195.72 196.69 B: or have they been 

195.85 198.94 A: yeah um yeah they've only had to vote off one person so far 

199.27 201.16 B: did they did they get rid of the older lady 

201.24 203.36 A: um who did they get rid off 

203.85 207.32 A: um yeah i think so the one that was sick originally or something like that 

207.92 210.89 A: she was sick on the first episode i don't know i can't think of her name 

207.99 208.92 B: uh okay 

211.26 211.72 B: uh huh 

211.79 212.33 A: but 

211.83 214.03 B: so uh why do you think they're so popular 

214.07 216.34 A: why 

215.75 216.14 B: mhm 

216.46 217.20 A: i don't know 

217.60 220.26 A: um real people in 

220.52 227.08 A: well i don't know if you can consider them real people some of them um i don't know i rea- i guess i really 

227.30 229.79 A: people getting a chance to do something that most of us can't 

231.01 232.19 B: yeah i guess so 

232.38 232.93 A: you 

233.31 237.81 B: i i don't know i think it's really so popular because 

238.11 243.49 B: i- it's you you get to see people sitting there being real and unscripted and 

242.37 242.91 A: right 

243.62 245.59 B: i i think i think uh 

245.70 248.48 B: most of american public just wants to uh 

248.75 255.56 B: sit there and and watch people have genuine emotions rather than you know some sort of scripted actor trying to 

255.89 256.56 B: simulate 

256.95 263.58 A: yeah yeah well now they got that uh celebrity um survivor kind of things going on and that's just terrible 

256.98 257.81 B: something real 

263.57 268.07 B: oh i think i heard about one of my friends was talking about that that had um 

269.37 270.87 B: gosh what was he saying 

271.04 276.69 A: y- they're not real real famous people i mean uh i mean bruce jenner and like robin leach and 

273.05 274.12 B: right 

276.83 280.06 A: uh downtown julie brown 

279.59 281.80 B: really they have her on there 

280.17 280.92 A: y- 

281.26 282.96 A: yeah but she's gone now 

283.32 283.88 B: oh 

283.83 287.69 A: um and i'm trying to think of oh joan rivers' daughter 

288.34 290.22 B: oh god i hate that girl 

289.73 292.56 A: she's the only chick left 

293.35 293.97 B: wow 

294.07 303.61 A: yeah it's it's really strange i mean they're not technically roughing it i mean they got cots and they got sleeping bags and their supplied food it's 

303.98 304.39 A: it's 

304.64 308.37 A: i don't know it's glorified camping but they're all dying 

307.95 309.71 B: did 

308.79 310.86 A: yeah it actually is kind of funny that way 

310.42 312.96 B: was that the one did they have gary coleman in it also

318.76 319.92 A: and 

319.31 321.50 B: i don't know who vince neal is 

320.82 322.44 A: um motley crue lead singer 

323.16 333.22 A: i'm an eighties m- uh yeah that's an eighties music thing um yeah that was gary coleman or not gary cole- was it gary coleman no that's um

347.87 349.54 A: he's he's a strange one but 

349.56 356.07 B: he uh plays the stuff that teen heartthrob that uh everyone had him pegged for in the eighties anymore 

355.14 358.04 A: no he's losing his mind 

358.16 359.66 A: it's actually pretty funny

368.00 369.05 B: um 

370.17 380.46 B: no i see with the fox ones i really i i can't i can't sit there and support what i think is just grossly immoral television and 

379.23 381.24 A: that's that one was very 

381.75 389.15 B: and and with most of fox it's it's it's really bad cause it's just like the only reason you could possible want to watch this is because you have this 

389.43 397.93 B: totally cynical outlook on on humans and you just want to sit there and watch them have these dirty nasty emotional conflicts with each other 

397.69 401.09 A: and fights and everything else and yeah that that was bad 

399.13 401.02 B: yeah yeah i mean 

401.86 411.98 B: a- all of fox's are are horrible uh joe millionaire was probably the most respectable of them uh who wants to marry a millionaire temptation island what else 

410.82 411.41 A: oh 

411.57 413.31 A: i can't even think of all of them 

412.53 416.47 B: all those i i didn't even watch temptation island but it's just like 

415.30 421.25 A: no they got i didn't catch this new one either something about marrying people or something what is that about
