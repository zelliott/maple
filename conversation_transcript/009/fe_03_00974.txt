0.51 1.88 B: hi my name 

0.69 2.75 A: (( hi [laughter] )) 

2.27 5.77 B: [laughter] my name is elisha what's your name 

5.69 6.80 A: diana 

6.48 7.68 B: diana 

6.93 8.22 A: (( did you say elisa )) 

8.18 9.13 B: (( elisha )) 

8.99 10.69 A: (( elisha okay )) 

11.27 12.99 A: this is my first time so 

12.85 14.89 B: this is my first time too 

14.35 18.75 A: oh wonderful [laughter] he said airport security what 

15.88 16.78 B: yes 

19.52 21.02 B: does it heighten 

21.97 25.16 B: is there less of a chance of an attack i think 

25.49 27.30 A: with the airport security 

26.71 27.94 B: mhm 

29.47 30.82 B: you go first 

30.89 33.21 A: [laughter] 

33.92 38.27 A: possibly so i do believe that there will be um 

38.26 51.18 A: if they follow certain safety measures then we can feel more secure if they do have heightened security but if someone is intent on doing something they will find a way 

52.15 53.88 A: that's my opinion [laughter] 

53.37 58.84 B: i agree and i think it also helps them to be a little bit more creative 

59.18 61.06 B: about how they can 

61.69 62.94 B: cause harm 

63.85 65.32 A: about how they can what 

65.22 67.17 B: how they could cause harm 

66.87 68.51 A: yes that's true 

68.32 70.98 B: you know and hopefully it 

71.37 73.92 B: will all this extra security [noise] 

76.17 78.29 B: will cause them to not want to 

78.82 84.06 B: i'm not saying that you know america should be attacked because i live here and i don't really want that 

84.08 89.51 B: but it would cause them to want to go different avenues perhaps you know 

89.24 90.20 A: right 

89.93 92.15 B: you know because of what happened 

92.85 95.54 B: september eleventh i thought was very very sad 

95.31 96.33 A: right 

96.60 97.63 A: i agree 

98.03 106.91 A: that's true because like i said if somebody definitely doesn't want definitely wants to cause harm they will find a way if it's not through 

104.99 106.25 B: mhm 

107.37 112.75 A: airport security it will be i mean through the airport system it will be through something else 

113.25 116.03 B: yeah because i think there's a lot of um 

117.13 121.57 B: i mean i really don't want us to become more like a socialistic or 

122.11 127.90 B: more military type of society where everywhere you go that's on public means of transportation 

128.15 133.01 B: you have to go through all types of different you know channels and things 

132.37 135.38 A: so would it bother you to have more security at an airport 

136.71 138.71 B: i refuse to fly now 

138.39 139.84 A: do you really 

139.46 141.60 B: well because it was 

142.67 147.74 B: it takes three hours just i live in atlanta and it takes three hours just to 

147.86 150.26 B: get to your plane 

150.06 151.60 A: oh my goodness 

151.19 154.11 B: aha because they have got so much over at hartsfield 

155.21 158.27 B: over at hartsfield they have so many 

159.70 166.18 B: you know so many things you have to do and it takes three hours just to get to 

167.02 170.38 B: you know the place where you can even be able to get on the plane 

169.56 170.94 A: right 

170.87 173.95 B: me i mean i could drive three hours 

173.36 174.89 A: [laughter] 

174.25 175.95 B: [laughter] 

175.15 178.68 A: that's true rather than have to go through all that hassle 

178.25 180.49 B: and my trip would be more 

181.87 191.26 B: you know i could drive three hours and still get there in the amount of time it would have used you know it depends on where i'm flying of course but 

191.54 192.41 B: you know 

192.44 195.42 B: i haven't flown have you flown since then 

194.61 202.30 A: no no but i'm not a big flyer i mean the last time i flew in an airplane was when we went to disneyworld i mean it's like 

202.36 205.73 A: i've probably flown like three or four times in my whole lifetime 

207.74 213.87 A: to be honest with you just because i heard you tell me that it takes that long if i really wanted to go somewhere it wouldn't stop me 

214.30 218.33 A: but you know i would consider if there is another method to get there 

218.54 219.65 A: i'm sure 

219.63 223.33 B: for instance georgia and florida are right beside each other 

222.85 224.20 A: mhm 

223.54 228.51 B: and it wasn't anything you know a few years ago to just fly 

228.70 234.04 B: you know to florida because they had all types of nice little discount rates and things like that 

233.68 234.69 A: right 

234.62 239.61 B: but there's no way now because you know those three hours i could be in florida 

239.52 240.68 A: that's true 

240.36 246.30 B: you know [laughter] so there's no way now and i think part of it is hurting the 

240.97 242.86 A: (( that's true that's true )) 

246.52 247.56 A: economy 

247.35 249.47 B: oh yeah i think it is 

249.51 256.01 A: do you think do you think it's the heightened security or the fact that people don't want to get on the planes because they are scared 

255.80 257.67 B: i think it's both 

257.11 258.50 A: both 

257.89 258.79 B: yeah 

258.67 260.40 A: (( mhm )) 

259.78 262.31 B: i think it's both i think um 

262.83 264.53 B: people don't um 

265.66 269.75 B: well for the one thing it's like what i said to you before because um 

272.34 273.44 B: i was at 

274.54 280.55 B: a party or it wasn't like a company party but there was a lot of delta employees there 

279.65 280.57 A: right 

281.45 284.37 B: and they were saying that 

284.50 287.91 B: a lot of people don't want to fly because of the wait 

288.56 290.48 B: in order to fly 

290.31 291.65 A: really 

290.92 292.84 B: yeah it takes to fly 

292.61 295.37 A: (( i wonder if we are having the same problem here in houston )) 

296.08 301.86 A: i live here in texas but i don't ever hear about any massive amount of 

301.88 303.07 A: wait time 

303.15 307.66 A: does that mean that they are not really heightening the security here [laughter] 

307.06 310.37 B: no they probably are you know um you know if 

310.52 312.63 B: you know here things are 

314.10 316.91 B: you know what i mean i mean they probably are 

316.70 320.96 A: it was on the news [mn] shortly after all that happened on nine eleven 

321.33 333.00 A: that they did like a run here and they found out that it wasn't they had to remember when i don't know if that happened over there in atlanta but they had to hire 

333.42 336.72 A: certain security companies they could i believe 

336.74 346.04 A: they had to hire them from the somebody from the government or something like that and a lot of people got laid off and they had found out a lot of people working in the airline industry were 

346.16 348.99 A: illegal people and stuff like that 

348.70 353.23 B: yeah they found yeah that was here in atlanta i think that was all over the country 

352.44 357.26 A: yeah that was pretty wild it's like that was kind of scary 

354.58 355.60 B: yeah 

357.28 359.63 A: you never know but then again 

359.88 364.35 A: you still never know it could be an american person that's going to do that it can be anybody 

363.83 365.18 B: mhm 

364.41 371.32 A: if they want it that's just my opinion you know if somebody is that wicked horrid and evil 

371.25 379.95 A: there's no measure of security that's going to stop them it's just going to make it that much harder or like you said they are going to think of another way to harm everybody 

379.89 382.81 B: yeah you know because just in general not just 

382.93 389.27 B: you know if there is something this is just humans i think if there is something that we really want to do 

388.97 390.27 A: mhm 

389.49 393.63 B: or that you really want to do you are going to go after it and do it 

393.17 394.14 A: that's true 

393.91 400.01 B: and you're not necessarily going to i mean things are going to come across to cause um 

400.33 407.40 B: like obstacles and things like that are going to happen but if you're really focused and if it's something you really want to do you are going to go after it 

406.85 407.83 A: that's true 

407.70 409.22 B: and i think that's 

409.65 412.04 B: it's sad to say but i think that's how 

412.16 416.73 B: you know the terrorists are i think there are probably a lot in this you know i think 

416.64 422.51 A: oh my goodness if they are willing to give up their lives like that [laughter] i just couldn't do that 

419.22 423.58 B: oh yeah there's just no way [laughter] 

423.25 428.98 A: you couldn't pay me enough my family enough or anybody for me to do that 

428.42 431.54 B: [laughter] i heard they didn't know they were going to die 

431.19 432.73 A: oh really 

432.07 436.84 B: they didn't find out until they were up in the planes and they were flying the planes 

436.24 439.29 A: (( really now that is one thing i never heard )) 

439.30 445.79 B: but i also had heard that when they were being taught in florida how to fly 

444.42 445.37 A: mhm 

445.38 446.42 A: right 

446.66 452.35 B: they weren't interested in learning how to land they just wanted to learn how to fly an airplane 

452.05 454.22 A: so then what did they think 

454.70 458.41 B: i don't know i mean a clue could have gotten there somehow 

457.95 460.24 A: no kidding if you're that intelligent 

459.77 461.25 B: you know but 

463.60 464.67 B: i wouldn't 

465.19 468.26 B: i'm sorry i wouldn't sacrifice my life for 

468.44 470.37 A: no [laughter] 

470.39 479.06 A: not for that kind of cau- not for any cause i mean you know i would die in a second for my child or anything like that but you know 

470.46 471.10 B: (( it )) 

479.38 485.55 A: not for that not knowing that i was going to bring pain and suffering in killing all those people you know for that kind of 

485.70 490.75 A: i don't know to me common sense but you know we don't live there we don't know what they go through 

491.08 494.17 A: you know we don't know what was in their minds other than 

494.39 497.83 A: hate that's what it just boils down to me 

495.23 496.29 B: mhm 

498.65 499.84 A: like i said 

500.14 504.23 A: no measure of security heightened airport security 

504.57 507.15 A: you pay somebody and they'll 

507.36 508.28 A: people 

508.30 510.73 A: are greedy and they will be bought out 

510.87 521.60 A: i mean how do you think they get got past all that i mean i don't know i just feel like some- somewhere along the line people will you know how you hear about people betraying their country and stuff 

510.91 511.97 B: yeah 

521.19 522.15 B: mhm 

521.57 527.22 A: and it's like you know they are bought out and if people are greedy enough they will take it 

527.07 529.08 B: i agree i agree 

529.14 530.20 B: they will 

530.57 534.72 B: they will what's so terrible about that whole thing that happened is that 

536.38 542.12 B: what was so terrible about it was that they were just doing the things that they do every day 

541.76 543.32 A: mhm 

542.64 551.24 B: they were just you know they were taking the train or they were driving to work but you know and then but in new york pretty much everybody takes the train 

550.78 552.13 A: right 

551.48 556.96 B: and they were walking and you know they were doing the things that you know you and i do 

556.54 559.21 A: right that's the scary thing [laughter] 

558.27 560.47 B: every day and 

560.96 563.91 B: it was that very thing that they hate 

564.03 565.77 B: that they try to 

566.15 568.51 B: you know they try to threaten 

568.32 569.59 A: right 

569.00 570.95 B: it wasn't i mean 

571.32 572.49 B: it wasn't 

573.44 580.28 B: i don't know it wasn't like a i know that they went after some political they were trying to go after the white house or that's what they say 

580.40 582.49 B: and they had gone after the pentagon 

582.20 583.51 A: right 

582.79 585.13 B: but it was almost 

585.19 588.11 B: it was to me it was an attack 

588.60 594.51 B: to the american people deliberately it wasn't just our government it was to us 

592.53 593.46 A: no 

594.74 596.94 B: and that was what was so 

597.01 598.03 A: scary 

598.04 599.89 B: (( and terrible about the whole sit- ))
