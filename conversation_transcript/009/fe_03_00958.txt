0.24 2.27 B: hi this is jeff who are you 

1.71 3.52 A: hi this is donna 

3.46 7.10 B: donna hi um so what do you think 

6.36 12.79 A: well it's really kind of hard to say i think the way it's going i think if a terrorist really wants to 

12.93 14.88 A: ah do something 

15.04 19.96 A: it's it's going to happen i don't think the security is really going to stop them 

20.65 33.29 B: [lipsmack] really um i guess i guess what i think is is i use um the security of my house as a little bit of an analogy um anybody that wants to get into my house if they're determined enough will get through 

28.14 29.05 A: uh-huh 

33.47 34.74 A: exactly 

34.26 35.33 B: (( ah )) 

35.35 41.37 B: but the the greater the security that i provide it's gonna weed out the the the people that are 

41.77 44.82 B: are using low level ah techniques um 

45.05 51.62 A: right i think it'll it'll weed out the crazies but i think a determined terrorist is going to get through 

45.67 47.00 B: you know i- it 

47.79 49.15 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

51.85 54.96 A: i think i think i think they'll find a way [mn] 

54.17 64.35 B: [noise] but you can weed out n- you can weed out a large percentage of them you can't you cannot you can never have one hundred percent effective s- security but i think that um 

64.61 77.49 B: um as you increase security ah you're you're gonna weed out you know more and more of them um the the w- i think the the thing that worries me the most is people on the ground ah with 

77.74 80.54 B: infra red homing missiles like a stinger 

80.61 83.46 B: sitting at the end of a runway as an airplane takes off 

82.90 92.42 A: yes that's that's very true there's not a whole lot that can be done about that ah what do you feel about the the pilots having weapons in the cockpit 

91.55 98.46 B: [sigh] i think it's probably a good idea um i'm a pilot myself i'm not a commercial pilot um 

97.48 98.32 A: mhm 

98.97 108.40 B: but i i think ah that if these guys on nine eleven had had weapons in the cockpit none of this would happen would have happened 

108.27 119.60 B: but it's almost it's almost at this point redundant because they've tried this and now they know that we are watching for this they won't do it this way again if if somebody wants to do something 

119.76 126.56 B: to hurt us ah they will try to find something that will surprise us not something that we know about 

125.88 130.67 A: [noise] [noise] or they may think we're not looking for that they may think that's what we're thinking 

130.39 131.73 B: yeah 

131.10 134.06 A: so i- i- i don't know it's ah 

134.09 141.00 A: ah now i think you're you're taking a chance [mn] but everything you do in life you're [noise] taking a chance 

140.76 141.89 B: that's true 

142.28 147.34 B: that's true but i i think i think that ah giving these guys a hand gun in the cockpit 

147.39 149.61 B: is probably a pretty good idea 

149.61 152.82 A: [lipsmack] yeah i i would agree with you there i think pilots for 

152.97 157.05 A: ah for the most part are pretty level headed i don't think they're 

157.23 162.72 A: all that gung ho where they're going to make a terrible mistake with it i i think they'll know what they're doing 

160.52 161.49 B: no 

162.43 170.31 B: [lipsmack] no i know i know a lot of pilots and and my best friend was a a retired pilot from american airlines so 

162.76 163.84 A: (( but ah )) 

169.34 170.24 A: uh-huh 

170.50 171.82 B: and i i 

171.92 180.10 B: th- th- th- there are no th- if if you're a bozo you don't you don't g- get through the screen to get ah get to be a pilot ah a commercial pilot 

178.52 186.15 A: that's true [laughter] that's very true your your statement about like the stinger missiles and all was very interesting though 

185.93 195.25 A: ah i wonder if the homeland security has really given that any thought and if they're taking any security measur- measures around airports 

195.20 197.26 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] i um )) 

195.97 199.10 A: for that at all if there's anything possible that they can do 

198.79 202.80 B: i'm sure they're thinking about it all the time um 

204.12 210.25 B: [sigh] i- it's it's so hard i i think it's hard to take security measures ah because there is i- 

210.26 222.04 B: if you think of the flight path of an airplane um on takeoff particularly ah yeah there's a there's a hu- there's a huge amount of area under that flight path from which somebody could sit there with a stinger missile 

215.29 217.77 A: oh there is so much ground to cover [laughter] 

221.44 223.28 A: yes yes there is 

222.87 230.16 B: and you know and how do you police every square inch of you know hundreds of thousands of acres ah off the end of the runway 

229.53 239.65 A: yeah that would be nearly impossible i'm sure plus even after the fact i think they would have a hard time even locating the general area from which it would would have come 

237.60 238.37 B: (( right )) 

239.91 245.27 A: ah i think that would be something really hard to to try to even be secure against 

245.10 252.61 B: yeah i i think that i think the protection is that um you can't go to your local m- wal-mart and buy a stinger missile 

252.06 255.67 A: [laughter] yes that's true last time i checked is 

253.06 263.12 B: ah and it would be pretty hard to aqu- to acquire in this country and you would have to smuggle one in and i think [noise] 

261.74 263.75 A: it as hard as you think 

263.89 265.88 A: uh i'm beginning to wonder 

265.90 272.45 A: ah all that i've seen and heard lately about things being smuggled in ah 

272.74 276.91 A: i'm sure there's a lot of things going on that you know we have no clue 

277.01 280.19 A: is happening i i don't think it's that difficult any more 

279.80 287.68 B: well i i guess you know i i c- i hadn't finished ah my statement but i i think that that's what i was getting to is is we don't know 

283.54 284.61 A: i'm sorry 

287.72 295.81 B: ah that would be the that would be be the way that it would be done is ah somebody would smuggle a stinger or some other type of heat seeking missile in 

296.14 299.60 B: and there are a lot of ways to get things into this country 

299.03 299.89 A: mhm 

300.31 301.60 B: so i don't know 

301.90 303.49 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah i ah )) 

304.17 309.06 A: i know i have thought about whether or not i would fly somewhere ah 

309.57 320.15 A: now after what's happened and i'm not sure that i would and i used to fly myself i was working on becoming a private pilot yes i was many years ago 

317.52 318.71 B: [noise] you were 

319.98 321.85 B: and what what what stopped you 

321.59 323.94 A: ah lack of money [laughter] 

323.44 324.96 B: that'll do it [laughter] 

324.17 325.95 A: i just ran out of money 

325.42 327.17 B: it's an expensive habit 

326.58 331.53 A: yes it is and i was flying back when it wasn't that expensive so 

331.03 332.52 B: when was that 

331.90 333.99 A: oh back in the ah 

334.03 336.53 A: back in the late seventies early eighties 

336.30 340.45 B: i got my license in nineteen seventy five i was nineteen years old 

338.96 339.74 A: well 

339.81 346.43 A: when then you're aware of what i'm talking about i was paying fifteen fifty an hour [laughter] but ah 

342.04 343.15 B: yep 

344.42 351.32 B: mhm that's that's what i was pa- i was paying fifteen bucks an hour for the airplane and six bucks an hour for the instructor [noise] 

350.66 357.60 A: yeah it was eight bucks for mine but ah knowing what i know about flying ah i really you know [mn] 

357.75 370.77 A: airports at that at that time they weren't secure at all ah and i haven't been around an airport much lately to really experience the security measures that they're going through now i'm glad they're doing it 

370.81 377.80 A: i think people are [mn] you know feeling much safer now but i wonder if they really are that much safer 

378.22 381.09 B: [mn] i think we are some um 

381.67 387.26 B: i i think it would be very difficult to do a repeat of nine eleven 

387.74 388.74 B: um 

387.91 389.26 A: i hope you're right 

389.74 400.02 B: but there are other other ways that people can get into airplanes and cause trouble ah you know y- i i think we still are not 

400.12 404.19 B: real well protected against blowing up an airplane in the middle of the sky 

404.61 414.96 B: um but i think i think taking over an airplane and having somebody somebody an evil person fly an airplane is a lot less likely 

412.36 414.18 A: that's gonna be too 

414.27 423.61 A: [lipsmack] yeah i agree with you there the thought of ah you know a biological attack even aboard an an aircraft that would cripple an airliner 

423.72 425.38 A: a- cripple a pilot 

425.75 438.08 B: [mn] well i don't think a bio- i don't think a biological attack would because that takes time but there's an incubation period but chemicals could could certainly ah raise havoc on an airplane [noise] mhm 

426.40 428.84 A: you're just releasing some kind of biological [noise] 

431.50 432.37 A: well 

436.78 441.55 A: yes definitely chemicals and and that could cause 

441.68 444.29 A: as much if not more of a catastrophe 

444.53 448.24 A: depending upon where the aircraft would've would come down so 

448.80 451.82 A: that could be bad and i don't know if there's anything [sigh] 

452.09 459.16 A: any way they could really be secure against that i- if someone got that substance aboard 

458.49 460.11 B: mhm mm 

459.91 464.59 A: so that's the only other thing that i had thought of that would really be difficult 

465.41 472.55 A: 'cause you've got your ground crew and to be one hundred percent safe i i just don't think it's possible 

472.32 481.13 B: [mn] no there there there is no such thing as one hundr- one hundred percent safety in life um i guess that's the phil- philosophical part is uh 

481.83 484.05 A: i think those days are behind us 

483.78 486.26 B: well we never had hundred per cent safety though 

485.78 488.66 A: but we felt safe [laughter] you know 

487.27 488.34 B: we felt 

488.43 489.83 B: yeah 

488.94 492.88 A: before this happened we had we had that air of [mn] 

494.40 507.52 A: being invincible i think and you know all that's happened now has really stopped and made people think are they that safe now and they realize that they're not and they probably haven't been but 

507.43 510.73 A: ah i- it can be frightening if you allow yourself to dwell on it 

510.70 519.79 B: [mn] [lipsmack] yes um [mn] but i think um i suspect people had similar feelings right after pearl harbor 

520.25 529.69 B: um people no longer felt safe and after a period of time after world war two ended and um 

521.32 522.00 A: (( mm )) 

529.74 531.71 B: we weren't attacked again 

531.77 538.84 B: people began to feel safe again and i think that is what will happen with this um is 

539.15 547.06 B: i don't think we're going to see a repeat of it um [mn] and i think it will fade into our memories and after a while we'll begin to feel safe again [lipsmack] 

547.22 556.69 A: [lipsmack] [mn] i i hope you're right do you know of ah can you think of any way ah security could be increased at airports now 

557.11 558.75 A: from what you have seen 

562.83 564.62 A: is there anything that could be done 

562.87 564.36 B: i don't think so 

564.47 565.93 B: i don't think so 

567.01 572.27 A: i don't either [mn] what i've looked at what they're doing i can't think of anything else 

572.21 579.99 B: i think i think one of the most important things they've done is um [mn] made it pretty difficult to get into the cockpit of an airplane 

580.77 587.42 B: and have trained pilots that um it doesn't matter what's happening in the back you need to fly the plane 

587.94 599.89 B: and what what happened in in this case is that ah they started killing members of the flight crew the s- the flight attendants and the pilots came back and that's
