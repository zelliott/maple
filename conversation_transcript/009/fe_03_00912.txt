7.54 11.14 A: so we are we are to talk about reality shows do you watch any of -em 

11.77 14.44 B: kind of but not a lot i mean 

14.80 18.92 B: sometimes if i flip channels and something is going on and that's hey that might be a nice thing 

19.29 20.08 B: then i watch it 

20.80 22.38 B: but other than that i really don't 

22.39 25.08 A: yeah i watch joe millionaire or um 

24.09 25.21 B: mhm mhm 

25.69 29.09 B: because like the who wants to marry a millionaire show 

29.52 31.49 B: i don't know it was probably filmed over what 

31.78 33.10 B: six months or something 

32.87 33.62 A: right 

33.44 35.29 B: i don't see how you can fall in love with 

35.51 39.16 B: and pick the one that you are going to spend the whole rest of your life with in six months 

39.52 43.56 A: well they have that thing on monday night wh- um which was 

43.89 48.11 A: um um let america pick your um 

48.85 50.04 A: husband or wife 

50.10 50.64 B: yeah 

51.63 60.38 A: that they they had the parents and friends ask questions of five people and then and america pick between two 

60.80 61.57 B: i mean that's just 

61.74 64.53 B: that's a lot of control to give somebody else that you don't even know 

64.74 69.43 A: i uh i wouldn't want to have my parents that's for sure 

67.11 68.17 B: oh no me neither 

68.74 70.91 B: my parents would've picked somebody totally opposite 

71.66 72.36 A: so um 

72.59 73.81 A: but 

73.90 74.75 A: that um 

77.73 80.04 A: anyhow reality shows 

80.76 81.12 A: um 

82.03 84.50 A: you don't didn't watch survivor didn't watch 

84.68 87.30 B: i watched the first season of survivor but 

88.34 90.53 B: after that it just became too 

91.81 92.45 B: i don't know 

92.74 96.18 B: too commercialized i guess it kind of came became pointless 

97.05 97.94 A: yeah i i 

98.03 104.04 A: i ended up well on of those i ended up watching um because there was just nothing else 

104.57 104.92 B: yeah 

104.98 109.57 A: on so i- you flip by and you're oh okay and then you get interested in it in a certain week 

105.84 106.19 B: yeah 

110.28 112.37 A: um and then it becomes interesting um 

115.23 119.95 A: but anyhow i've watched that uh that joe millionaire one where um 

120.42 121.04 A: they and uh 

123.26 124.94 A: my wife and i watched that and it was uh 

125.49 126.83 A: we went to um 

127.94 139.17 A: look at look at the show and they had um the it was down to between this one girl who seemed to be a gold digger verses this one girl that really seemed to have a a pure and good heart 

138.93 139.25 B: right 

141.17 147.86 A: and the one with the pure and good heart actually won out over the other girl the um the gold digger went through 

148.00 152.36 A: quite a few different things to make sure that she would be the one picked and um 

152.52 155.48 A: so i thought that was an interesting um part of the show 

155.95 158.67 B: well i know the new one that they have on about 

159.20 161.36 B: um i'm a celebrity get me out of here 

161.58 162.03 A: yeah 

162.06 162.80 B: that's just 

163.61 165.36 B: it's pointless to me i mean it makes 

166.06 168.19 B: no sense whatsoever i don't think 

168.39 179.97 A: you know i i can't i couldn't figure out what that i i i flipped by it watched a little bit of it and it's like w- wh- what are they doing and why are they doing what they are doing it just didn't make any that made less sense than any of these other ones 

179.92 182.86 B: yeah i mean nobody is doing anything on the show this just 

182.95 183.62 B: every day 

184.94 190.89 B: living a life hanging out in the cat- campground i mean the challenges are kind of interesting to watch but 

191.14 193.19 B: other than that the rest of it i think is boring 

193.50 197.81 A: yeah did you wa- did you watch the um any of that fear factor show 

198.43 201.07 B: now that one i watch some of those are interesting 

201.63 203.94 A: yeah they they had um my wife was telling me last 

204.70 206.85 A: l- the last fear factor the um 

207.43 210.38 A: they strapped their arms down on a table 

210.39 210.81 B: mhm 

210.97 213.21 A: and then they what they did was stuck a needle 

214.03 215.80 A: um under the skin and you know 

216.03 222.89 A: through um through the up- just the upper part of their arm and then they then kept on increasing needle size 

218.98 219.37 B: mhm 

223.65 229.25 A: and um people that went to the largest needle size won that challenge 

229.54 230.39 B: oh my god 

231.78 232.20 A: i've 

232.47 236.45 A: i've don't think that (( needleation )) is is 

237.90 239.52 A: entertaining television 

238.86 239.32 B: yeah 

239.71 244.19 B: i mean i don't mind needles at all i'll sit there and let somebody draw blood all day but 

244.34 247.56 B: i don't think i would let -em stab me with needles just for the pure fun of 

248.14 249.59 B: seeing how much i can take 

250.46 253.01 A: yeah well they they do it for fifty thousand dollars also 

253.20 254.72 B: well yeah still i don't 

255.12 257.71 B: i don't think you could pay me enough money to do that 

257.91 261.75 A: now that is another um is another area i would not i wouldn't do 

263.66 264.91 B: i really do not 

265.03 267.29 B: think you could pay me enough money now the only 

267.81 271.69 B: the only fear factor that i really really like is awhile back 

272.23 273.45 B: they did one 

273.63 275.52 B: a fire fighter challenge where people 

275.84 277.87 B: had to wear the full fire fighter gear 

278.32 281.08 B: and go in a burning a building that was in a control burn of course 

281.15 281.52 A: right 

281.45 284.47 B: rescue uh find a hose put out the fire rescue the dummy 

284.86 288.62 B: and get back out and whoever did it in the shortest amount of time won 

289.26 291.84 B: i thought that one was interesting but that's just because 

292.39 293.75 B: my dad is a fire fighter 

294.18 296.65 B: and so it was interesting to see how normal people 

297.37 298.50 B: dealt with 

298.32 301.53 A: uh dealt dealt with um a hazard like that 

301.11 304.65 B: yeah something that i'm used to doing every day with my parents 

308.04 310.64 A: gross foods or um 

311.28 315.01 A: having to do s- stupid little things is um worth it 

316.09 316.42 B: yeah 

316.78 318.14 B: i completely agree 

318.51 321.70 B: but i guess once the popularity is survivor then 

322.04 323.58 B: kind of like everything else in our world 

323.74 325.09 B: once one thing goes then 

325.45 327.06 B: everybody jumps on the band wagon 

327.48 334.52 A: well no i think um there is a huge uh um road rules group out there too that um was a semi- 

335.05 336.32 A: reality show 

336.19 337.10 B: on m._t._v. 

337.15 337.55 A: yeah 

337.63 339.53 B: i remember hearing about it but again it 

340.09 341.30 B: didn't really make any sense 

342.99 345.22 A: yeah that um yeah uh uh this put 

345.44 351.15 A: put people together and have -em whine and complain on a bus um as they drive around the country 

351.34 351.66 B: yup 

351.91 352.19 B: what's 

352.49 353.89 B: what is the point i 

353.59 356.38 A: you know i don't understand any point behind that 

357.32 360.91 B: i really just do not see a big point or reason for it at all 

361.92 365.43 B: so i think reality t._v. shows will go for a little bit but 

366.07 367.00 B: overall 

367.21 368.88 B: i think everybody will just get tired of it 

369.08 369.66 B: eventually 

369.89 374.50 A: you know i guess as long as their making um getting ratings uh they'll they will keep on it 

374.61 375.19 A: and they'll 

375.41 380.65 A: keep making it more and more sensational until it's idiotic and then they'll all go away 

381.07 381.39 B: yeah 

381.98 384.68 A: uh sort of like the big game show boom 

384.80 392.55 A: of the um fifties where that's what everybody watches every evening was the game show which was um you know 

393.01 395.11 A: just different ways of um a- 

395.31 397.67 A: a- another way of sort of reality t._v. 

397.87 399.75 B: but you know those are coming back like 

400.11 404.52 B: uh who wants to be a millionaire that reali- that's kind of reality based because it was real time 

404.84 406.49 B: and you really called people for help 

407.22 411.52 B: and then i think they um after the popularity of that one didn't they bring back the um pyramid game 

412.02 413.95 A: yeah they they ever bring back it w- uh 

414.19 420.59 A: they are recycling a lot of these reality ones like the newly wed game and the dating game they are all coming back next season 

427.47 427.89 A: interest 

430.80 433.27 A: other people's lives and um 

433.46 437.24 A: maybe because they are so bored with their own i don't know but uh um 

437.80 444.22 A: they see what people will do for uh um or how stupid they are sometimes i'll watch that and i'll go 

444.70 446.09 A: that makes me feel a lot smarter 

446.31 446.63 B: yeah 

447.02 447.58 B: definitely 

447.87 454.20 B: but maybe it's like you know let's see if these clothes are coming back so that the fifty games the fifties style games have to come back with -em 

454.53 455.00 A: yup 

456.28 456.93 A: so 

457.04 465.24 A: well uh we're we're probably about run out of time here so now i i uh i i under- the understand they hang on is this your first call with them 

461.49 462.89 B: we've been i've been on the 

465.19 469.90 B: yeah it's my first one the they called monday but my husband answered the phone and was like 

470.16 477.13 B: what what are they talking about and he had no clue so he just said hello hello you have the wrong number and he hung up the phone and i said no no no 

477.33 478.42 B: don't do that please 

478.99 482.29 B: so then i told him about it and he was like oh well if you would have told me about that 

482.39 482.83 B: sooner 

483.15 485.75 A: so so you do the uh do you do (( shop- )) shopping 

485.84 486.24 B: yes 

486.41 486.84 A: okay 

488.08 490.46 B: uh that's how i found out about it
