16.02 18.11 A: yeah weapons disarming iraq 

18.52 20.07 B: what do you think 

19.73 28.74 A: well i think i think something has to be done i'm not real sure that i'm the best person to say what needs to be done i voted for george bush and i support him completely 

29.03 29.55 B: yeah -m 

29.96 37.42 A: i just wish we had more international support on the topic i would certainly be more for it if more people were there to back us up 

30.27 30.77 B: i 

37.00 38.73 B: right i 

38.83 42.43 B: i'm pretty opposing to the war so i'm like 

42.85 45.11 B: i don't know i'm not really for it 

45.94 52.05 B: for the war and anything so and pretty much anything to do with it and george bush some of the things i don't really agree with 

52.46 52.96 A: oh yeah 

53.26 54.47 B: yeah so 

55.31 56.15 B: i don't know 

55.32 55.92 A: so what do you 

56.03 57.36 A: what do you think we should do 

58.33 59.79 A: i mean do you think we should just 

59.34 62.24 B: i don't know what we could do to make it peaceful 

62.43 62.91 A: mhm 

63.67 65.96 B: so 

66.06 72.33 A: so if we were in his position as president and you know this was our decision to make and 

72.88 73.70 A: and um 

74.38 76.13 A: i mean what what would what 

76.51 79.34 A: what advice would you give him if you could talk to him right now 

79.60 81.57 A: i guess that would that would be my question 

81.81 88.00 A: i don't know that i would have any advice to give him i don't envy the man for being in the position he is in 

85.38 86.26 B: i know 

88.94 89.72 B: my 

89.90 93.90 B: advice i don't know i think he is in a very tough position 

95.06 95.92 B: i mean 

97.32 99.34 B: i don't know what my advice would be my advice 

99.89 103.89 B: would be to get out of it but you really can't do that peacefully 

103.64 104.20 A: right 

104.83 107.30 A: the funny thing i heard the other night and i know this sounds 

107.43 107.95 A: um 

108.32 109.95 A: strange but i was at 

110.34 113.83 A: i was at a waffle house of all places and i'm listening to the cook 

112.43 112.90 B: uh-huh 

114.20 118.90 A: who seemed to know more about it than anybody which is a little bit ironic to me anyway 

117.94 118.43 B: yeah 

119.04 122.02 A: but you know his his thought process was that 

122.57 123.97 A: we forget about the war 

124.36 126.80 A: we bring all of our people out out of iraq 

124.72 125.24 B: mhm 

127.01 128.78 A: bring out all of our people 

128.97 132.64 A: all of our military back in to the united states close our borders off 

132.93 134.24 A: and just keep to ourselves 

134.65 136.77 B: yeah that would be so nice 

134.67 135.62 A: (( )) 

137.17 137.58 A: yeah 

137.34 137.72 B: but 

137.86 139.82 B: america would never do that 

139.71 145.38 A: and then he he had some very valid points that you know we we have all of the things we need right here in this country 

142.02 142.51 B: yeah 

145.69 149.97 A: what do we need all of these countries for why are we so concerned with what is going on over there 

150.30 150.80 B: mhm 

150.69 158.64 A: and uh i guess my only thing is that you know we need to do something so that we don't encounter the same problems that we had on september the eleventh 

158.85 159.44 B: right 

159.60 160.87 A: but w- what do you do 

159.83 161.03 B: that is my biggest 

161.14 163.30 B: my biggest fear is something else happening 

163.39 163.90 A: mhm 

164.55 165.40 B: i mean i 

165.69 171.78 B: i disagree with the whole um i don't know if you know about the whole like color-coded alert thing 

171.63 172.11 A: mhm 

172.47 173.00 B: that 

172.57 173.94 A: you mean the terror alert 

174.03 174.85 B: yeah 

174.74 175.07 A: right 

175.38 176.87 B: i think that is just silly 

177.51 178.83 B: i mean 

179.26 180.52 B: i really don't 

180.85 183.71 B: i learned about it last year in government class 

183.38 183.86 A: mhm 

183.81 184.40 B: and 

184.69 191.73 B: i mean i know about it because of that but i know a majority of people do not know about it like my mom doesn't really understand it 

191.81 199.04 A: oh i don't really understand it i know that you know it's high it's moderate it's low but what does that mean to me am i supposed to run out and buy gas masks 

193.34 194.20 B: right 

199.19 199.96 A: or 

206.42 206.77 B: (( -bout )) 

206.96 207.39 A: right 

207.63 209.74 B: i mean i'm not really sure what is going on there 

211.04 214.62 A: do you have any relatives or friends in the military that are overseas right now 

214.99 219.77 B: no luckily i don't i do have a friend that is going over s- in a month 

220.01 220.63 A: oh okay 

220.42 222.08 B: i think it's um 

222.45 224.85 B: i don't think he is going over to iraq so 

225.62 228.73 B: i'm not really sure where he is going i know he is trying to get out of it 

228.48 228.94 A: right 

230.19 232.79 A: i- it's a tough call we've g- i've got a cousin that's 

233.22 235.78 A: with in texas on his way over 

236.19 240.23 A: and i don't know if he has already gone over or if he is still in texas waiting for the call 

241.07 241.56 A: but 

242.86 246.36 B: oh that is so scary that's scary to me i 

243.34 243.69 A: (( )) 

246.72 248.28 B: i can never be in the military 

248.28 249.20 A: no not (( ex- )) 

248.45 250.88 B: i'm such a pacifist i just 

251.05 251.71 B: kind of 

251.97 253.18 B: whatever you know 

253.17 253.71 A: i know 

254.16 258.35 A: and i think that's probably you know a a thing that a lot of people in america 

258.99 265.46 A: just don't really think about it until it comes down to something like this is what our military goes through and what is expected of them 

265.92 267.92 A: you know when when something like this comes up 

268.37 268.84 B: uh-huh 

269.44 276.33 A: i mean whether it is the president talking or it's you and me talking we are not the ones making sacrifices so it's easy for us to say don't send them in 

276.66 277.79 A: or do send them in 

278.11 283.07 A: but we're not in the military we're not you know making that ultimate sacrifice to go over there and do what we're 

283.65 285.20 A: told to do to defend our country 

285.51 285.96 B: right 

287.06 292.41 A: so i i feel really bad for them especially for the ones that are opposed to it have no choice but to go 

291.84 293.97 B: exactly and they do it 

294.73 300.28 A: and you have to and you have to wonder if those that are really opposed to it they have no choice but to go over there and 

294.87 295.39 B: just -cause 

300.39 302.22 A: do their job and defend their country 

302.48 303.03 B: mhm 

302.99 305.04 A: you know a- are they really 

305.40 307.14 A: going over there with everything they've got 

307.31 309.75 A: you know are they really doing their jobs are they really 

310.41 312.15 A: going over there with the mentality of 

312.50 314.83 A: i'm here to defend my country with whatever it takes 

315.22 317.07 A: or are they just going to be passive about it 

317.43 317.87 B: yeah 

317.77 321.10 A: you know because they they don't they don't support it so they're really not 

321.93 322.42 A: you know 

322.87 324.10 A: don't have the heart in it and 

324.34 326.34 A: won't do what they are called to do 

326.83 327.33 B: mhm 

327.79 328.39 B: i 

329.25 331.65 B: i know um my one cousin 

332.01 333.59 B: um was in the military 

334.02 335.56 B: and he joined it for 

335.73 336.35 B: um 

337.14 339.15 B: because he really couldn't pay for college 

339.78 345.97 B: you know some people do that and really don't want to go to war and stuff but then they end up do going to war 

341.29 341.70 A: right 

346.24 346.76 A: mhm 

346.86 347.92 B: and that is scary 

348.09 348.54 A: right 

348.71 349.22 A: it is 

349.71 350.28 B: (( to )) 

351.27 355.90 B: think it's scary luckily he is out of it now he has a family now so 

355.55 355.92 A: oh 

356.05 356.67 A: that is good 

356.25 358.14 B: we are not afraid for him anymore 

364.28 365.38 A: tough decision to make 

365.68 369.72 A: i wish we could just all get along but it is not happening so we need to do something the quest- 

369.59 371.79 B: yeah and it is just what to do 

369.82 370.63 A: is what 

371.52 380.27 A: yeah and and so i just have to sit at home and watch t._v. and listen because i can't make the decision you know it doesn't matter what i say -cause whatever is going to happen is going to happen 

378.21 378.94 B: mhm 

380.61 385.29 A: but then you turn on the news and you see all these sad stories about the military families and you watch 

385.40 389.64 A: people say goodbye to their spouses and their sons and their daughters and 

388.76 389.30 B: yeah 

390.15 394.20 A: and uh that is probably the hardest part for me not so much that we are 

393.07 395.21 B: and over like holidays 

395.30 395.69 A: yeah 

395.72 397.91 B: like christmas and stuff like that 

397.68 398.22 A: mhm 

399.11 399.58 A: yeah 

399.81 402.70 B: it's really sad well i know my cousin 

400.67 401.48 A: so 

402.87 405.08 B: he had to live down in florida 

406.38 407.79 B: and um 

408.88 412.80 B: yeah we never got to see him for a couple of years you know it's just 

413.10 413.76 B: it is tough 

413.16 413.65 A: right 

414.00 414.41 A: yeah 

414.78 418.67 B: it is really tough luckily he didn't have to go overseas or anything he just 

418.89 419.93 B: worked on the base 

420.42 420.86 A: mhm 

421.20 421.77 B: so 

424.29 424.74 B: yeah 

425.93 426.56 B: i 

427.02 429.63 B: i don't really watch too much on 

429.97 435.85 B: the news on iraq and stuff -cause it personally kind of scares me to like know too much information 

433.87 434.27 A: mhm 

435.93 437.14 A: yeah but you know 

437.33 440.81 A: and and i'm the same way to a certain extent but i've sort of over the last 

440.95 444.38 A: uh probably over the last month i've developed a mentality of 

445.03 448.14 A: you know whatever is going to happen is going to happen you know it is out of my control 

448.46 448.99 B: mhm 

448.50 448.95 A: you know 

449.33 451.79 A: and um i think you know inevitably 

452.08 457.41 A: i'm a religious person i go to church i read the bible and the bible tells me that there is going to be another war 

457.56 458.28 A: eventually 

458.63 460.97 A: and maybe this is it and maybe this isn't but 

461.20 466.82 A: i do know that you know whatever is going to happen is going to happen whether i stress over it or or not 

467.29 469.37 B: right we really have no control over it 

467.45 467.91 A: so 

469.18 469.92 A: exactly 

470.33 480.68 A: exactly so i mean i'll i'll support whatever i have to support this is my country and my country as a whole makes a decision that this is what we need to do then i'll support it 

481.14 481.59 A: but 

481.18 481.66 B: mhm 

481.70 484.37 A: there is not really anything i can do about it so 

484.17 484.72 B: right 

484.59 488.31 A: what what can i do to support it even i mean say i support it 

488.62 490.95 A: i'm not doing anything i'm not going over there 

491.38 491.85 B: um 

491.43 491.83 A: so 

492.09 496.76 B: yeah i we had a um rally actually at the school yesterday a walk-out 

497.15 497.71 A: oh yeah 

497.41 506.04 B: and um i didn't participate in it because i just there is nothing really that i can do you know if we walk out or not that has really no effect 

502.21 502.69 A: mhm 

504.14 504.51 A: right 

506.01 506.48 A: mhm 

507.02 510.80 B: i mean maybe i'm too like not caring but 

511.57 516.91 B: personally i don't think we really have a decision at all it's really what the president wants to do 

514.44 514.85 A: right 

516.73 517.22 A: mhm 

518.28 525.75 A: yeah it sounds pretty much like he is making up making up his mind and he would like to see the support too but whether he gets it or not he knows what he is going to do 

527.49 527.89 A: so 

527.49 528.47 B: yeah 

529.03 529.36 B: i 

529.99 530.54 B: i won't 

531.30 533.04 B: agree with it but i won't 

533.31 535.37 B: you know do anything to or like 

535.58 539.95 B: disagree like go on a rally an anti-war rally or anything 

537.31 538.52 A: right 

539.72 542.78 A: no marching in washington for me right 

541.47 546.31 B: right yeah i'm not really in to that but i mean 

546.91 550.20 B: i i'm glad i don't have to be faced with that decision 

550.29 550.81 A: mhm 

551.08 555.19 A: uh that makes two of us this is a hard topic to talk about for ten minutes isn't it 

552.60 553.27 B: yeah 

555.00 556.97 B: it really is i mean 

555.54 557.55 A: you kind of go in circles
