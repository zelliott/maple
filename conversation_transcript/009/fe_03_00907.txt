327.62 330.04 A: a lot of people watch ah racing 

330.37 336.10 A: for for the crashes i guess that's a s- maybe it's the same ah thought process there 

335.84 340.08 B: it's the same thing 'cause they know that somebody's going to be humiliated or you know 

339.77 345.85 A: well i don't watch it for that i just li- [laughter] i guess i'm an all american guy i just want to look at the girls

346.21 347.89 A: [laughter]
