222.69 224.19 B: pretty much being a pain in the ass 

224.84 232.47 B: but um and it's like well military would be good for him too but he has no spleen so they wouldn't take him 

235.47 237.35 A: my son was fixing to go but 

238.84 240.29 A: he changed his mind and 

240.73 243.71 A: i'm mean this here was they was talking about war and everything 

243.97 245.07 B: yeah

267.25 267.59 A: right 

270.61 271.77 B: yeah 

272.40 272.84 B: guess it 

272.42 273.02 A: but if it 

273.13 274.63 A: i mean if it was a situation where 

276.06 278.11 A: where he was over there you know i wouldn't 

278.84 280.43 A: i'd worry 

280.59 283.72 B: oh definitely definitely be worried about him 

282.12 282.71 A: proud

287.25 288.10 B: i mean 

289.44 290.22 A: i mean why 

290.64 291.40 A: why uh 

293.26 293.79 A: you know it 

294.37 296.06 A: you shouldn't be bitching about it if

302.09 302.67 A: you know i 

303.38 306.20 A: i feel if you haven't done something about it then don't bitch about it 

306.75 310.19 B: yeah that's kind of like the if you haven't voted then you can't talk 

310.46 310.80 A: that's right 

311.29 312.67 B: king of thing yeah 

313.42 316.49 B: you don't vote then shut up 

316.10 317.63 A: that's right exactly

322.40 323.64 B: do something but
