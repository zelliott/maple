233.37 234.55 A: okay 

234.70 239.76 A: so easter then is your personal favorite not because it's anything that the town does like a 

236.91 237.88 B: my pers- 

239.82 242.08 A: a easter egg hunt or anything it's 

240.99 251.80 B: right no it's just like personal because it's to me it's like renewing you know er all the flowers are coming up you know and it's just it's just a time of renewal 

251.87 254.86 B: you know after the dark dank winter days 

253.50 256.08 A: oh right the dark winter days 

255.53 262.92 B: you know and the two hundred and fifty dollar electric bills because we have so much snow [laughter] and that kind of stuff 

258.53 259.95 A: [laughter] 

262.65 264.69 A: or if there's not that much 

264.91 269.05 A: snow it's just the dang oil prices are so high 

268.15 274.35 B: right [laughter] right or the gas prices 'cause i know our gas prices are going up and up they're like 

274.00 277.57 A: profit arm keeps going up keeps going up 

275.66 282.31 B: yeah that's for sure what what holiday would you if you could create a holiday what would you do 

282.03 284.19 A: what would i create 

284.45 296.62 A: and not mentioning anything cheesy like it's my birthday holiday [laughter] no i c- i couldn't give the whole country a day a day off 'cause of my birthday that would be so unfair um 

287.63 290.34 B: yeah you can't do that [laughter] 

295.43 296.45 B: right 

297.24 299.61 A: [sigh] what is missing i 

300.05 301.21 A: guess 

300.45 303.22 B: i i think a family day 

303.67 306.76 A: you think national family day 

303.81 305.76 B: national family day 

306.67 311.73 B: where all the family members have got to come you know it's like a national family reunion 

312.47 313.95 A: that's interesting 

313.94 317.94 B: you know because i know you know i've got family all over the country 

316.96 319.41 A: mhm 

318.16 320.48 B: you know and i don't get to see them that much 

320.70 323.58 B: so it would be neat if it was a federal holiday 

323.63 338.55 B: you know and i knew my brother in law didn't have to work 'cause he works as a government contractor so you know he'd get that holiday 'cause he's doing that kind of job you know and my nephew would have off from college and they could come to the east coast and you know we could all be together you know [laughter] 

331.14 332.33 A: right 

338.47 347.64 A: uh um i'm i'm thinking more about your idea that's a good idea so it would be on a monday tha- and that gives people time 

345.46 346.48 B: it gives you the 

346.74 348.39 B: whole weekend 

348.03 362.52 A: to yeah to to get to where they need to do so sunday would kinda be like the first day of the festivities or saturday night sunday and then monday maybe a goodbye breakfast and all the family members are going back to 

350.26 352.96 B: right or even a friday and a monday 

354.28 355.83 B: right right 

356.54 357.38 B: right 

360.45 364.02 B: mhm and everybody can go where they need to go 

363.17 365.81 A: you know that would help the airlines too 

365.27 367.49 B: oh yeah it would help everybody 

366.87 369.71 A: you've thought about this did you have your questions 

367.72 371.69 B: (( you know just think of what hallmark could do with national family reunions [laughter] [laughter] )) 

370.39 372.07 A: national family day 

372.92 375.74 A: that means everybody would have to get a card 

375.16 376.27 B: that's right 

376.07 380.15 A: the sister in law you didn't like the nieces and nephews who never say thank you 

379.99 382.33 B: right oh yeah i got them 

380.65 383.40 A: or never write you a thank you card [mn] [cough] 

382.53 385.87 B: [laughter] right but you ca- still keep sending the presents anyway 

385.76 388.47 A: right right even though they don't send you a thank you note 

387.84 395.01 B: right i did that until they reached the age of majority and then i said ah they're adults now if i don't get anything they don't get anything [laughter] 

394.36 402.05 A: [laughter] and then you get the phone call asking ah why did the gravy train stop what happened oh we 

395.66 396.49 B: so 

399.86 401.51 B: right [laughter] 

401.55 404.91 B: no i think they knew better 'cause that call never came you know [laughter] so 

403.83 410.80 A: [laughter] let me let me take a second and think what kind of holiday would i try to create 

413.42 416.14 A: [sigh] uh how about a motor cycle rally day 

416.75 418.54 B: lot of motor cyclists around 

418.70 426.35 A: yeah and i i started riding a motor cycle almost twenty years ago after i got out of high school and 

423.37 424.42 B: oh my 

425.51 426.33 B: (( mhm )) 

427.53 431.49 A: i've gone to the americade in 

431.59 436.08 A: lake george new york upstate new york where like fifty thousand bikers 

433.46 434.34 B: mhm 

435.66 436.69 B: oh my 

435.99 441.10 A: ah congregate around the lake's activities and things and it's a whole brotherhood 

440.95 442.12 B: (( oh that's neat )) 

440.99 451.35 A: it's not at all like the image of ah [sigh] hells angels on wheels and tho- you know harleys are more a status symbol now than they were 

445.17 447.36 B: the hells angels right 

451.10 452.05 B: right 

451.58 461.68 A: years ago but just any motor cycle whether it's a honda or suzuki or an american harley davidson a rally day perhaps for like some type of cause 

459.63 460.27 B: (( [cough] )) 

461.78 463.65 A: maybe easterfields 

461.90 462.68 B: (( right )) 

463.69 464.66 B: (( right mhm )) 

463.70 470.35 A: one day or ah you know the jerry lewis muscular dystrophy type of benefit another year 

470.29 481.66 A: so each year not only would you have the brotherhood of motor cyclists going to a new destination like maybe they'll hit virginia beach one year maybe they'll hit daytona um 

482.00 489.06 A: mm i don't know baltimore maryland one year but there's a purpose behind it too so you have the brotherhood and then there's a 

484.20 485.75 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

489.18 491.52 A: something good coming out of it besides 

490.63 495.14 B: that would be neat i know last ah last spring a bunch of motor cyclists
