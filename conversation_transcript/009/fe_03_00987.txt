20.82 26.69 A: on even what it is um i don't know if it's if it's talking or maybe it's general 

27.06 34.33 A: if it's chemical or if it's uh the disease that they're talking about [noise] what do you think on that 

33.99 36.20 B: i believe it's probably chemical 

35.85 37.13 A: the chemical 

37.00 38.54 B: i believe it is 

37.89 39.26 A: yeah 

38.83 43.14 B: i mean that's just my own belief i don't know what they're talking about but [laughter] 

42.38 44.36 A: i don't know really either 

43.17 49.25 B: i think bioterrorism in my mind is [noise] chemical warfare 

48.93 52.98 A: um what do you think where do you think [noise] anthrax [noise] is that considered a chemical 

53.48 55.81 B: i would think that would fall in that category 

55.13 59.86 A: yeah where smallpox would be the would be a different one right 

57.47 58.90 B: mhm 

59.50 61.24 B: (( [mn] right )) 

61.14 62.05 A: um 

61.44 63.09 B: well i d it might be 

62.08 73.74 A: i mean i don't think our government's um prepared for as far as if w if it's going to take place [noise] you know what protocol would need to be done at the local level 

74.35 76.22 A: [noise] to prevent it 

74.49 78.57 B: mm i i don't think it's fathomable in the united states of america 

77.02 78.30 A: i don't either 

78.37 80.90 A: i don't either i think that um 

81.44 83.12 A: (( our government )) 

83.56 91.02 A: even thinks that there's a way to prevent it i'm not sure that it that there is [noise] i don't know if it's just something that will happen 

92.58 95.66 A: whether we want it to or not or if it's more of a threat 

95.75 98.62 A: um use of a threat from these other countries 

98.72 104.43 B: i believe that it could happen i believe strongly that it could [cough] as in um 

100.37 101.30 A: yeah 

105.48 106.46 B: uh 

108.18 108.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

108.91 112.35 B: my phone is crazy i don't know what that's about 

111.68 116.48 A: i do think it's easier for that for this kind of a threat more even so than the 

116.54 118.31 A: [mn] world trade centre 

118.32 119.57 A: (( tragedy )) 

118.68 119.96 B: oh i agree 

119.64 125.51 A: because it c i mean you can get a little charter plane and you know and dump you know dump something off there's no 

125.74 132.19 A: [noise] you know these people they access or whoever doesn't have to crash the plane or you know they can go home 

131.40 134.53 B: you could have a crop duster and do that 

132.82 137.94 A: exactly i think its um airport security has improved quite a bit and the 

138.05 144.23 A: i think the federal government has done a good you know maybe a good part on doing that but i think they have almost 

144.33 151.78 A: [noise] it maybe [noise] they make the population feel like its they're doing something but yet the um the bioterrorism 

150.28 151.59 B: i think that's 

151.66 156.22 B: like having a burglar alarm in your house it's a false sense of secu- of security 

154.83 155.84 A: it is 

156.09 157.67 A: i think it is too 

157.42 159.56 B: (( i don't think )) 

160.18 164.30 B: i'm not quite sure that i agree [noise] about that but [cough] 

163.46 164.88 A: yeah i don't 

164.93 166.46 A: i think that um 

166.72 170.91 A: [lipsmack] i don't know if the president if we go into this war if um 

170.81 183.28 A: with iraq if i'm not sure i mean i'm almost afraid to have us do that and i'm al i'm even afraid of our military being you know out of our country and being [noise] where they can be exposed to all these different agents too 

183.30 194.04 B: well and and if you if you want to go even farther and think about it there possibly could be people in our military that were the same kind of people that were u._s. citizens 

193.40 194.47 A: mhm 

194.22 197.08 B: that bombed the world trade centre as well 

196.24 197.95 A: yeah that's true 

197.28 198.44 B: i mean how 

198.62 200.61 B: (( i'm not quite [noise] )) 

198.76 199.91 A: that's true 

200.29 202.28 A: there's um i mean there's no 

201.28 203.82 B: check identification for people that are 

204.62 206.94 B: are in our military 

205.05 205.99 A: yeah 

206.72 208.68 A: that's right there's no way to know 

207.36 215.25 B: how long do you have to be a u._s. citizen or you know on and on and on if you are can can you join the military and you probably can 

214.94 223.75 A: yeah i'm sure yeah i mean in our [mn] as a country we can't [noise] you know back down i think from the from these radical you know the other countries that are 

224.07 231.90 A: and i do i mean i don't think saddam hussein should be allowed to you know they've got evidence of any kind of um nuclear weapons or 

232.03 246.62 A: and they've been stockpiling you know they've shown since the mid nineties i guess [noise] that he's been stockpiling you know all the different things it takes to to make those bombs or dirty bombs or whatever however they distr- you know distribute those 

236.34 239.00 B: (( [cough] )) 

246.02 249.23 B: mhm as a mother of young children you must be terrified 

248.63 255.92 A: it is it is scary and we try we don't talk about it with them and because you don't they really can't absorb a whole lot because they're little 

254.63 255.92 B: (( right i'm )) 

256.26 263.32 A: and you don't want to get into the panic of you know stockpiling duct tape but yet you want to be prepared because i think that you have to be 

263.55 271.19 A: um somewhat prepared but the only the only information that i gain is what you hear on the news and i don't i mean i 

270.30 274.09 B: not quite sure that that's always the true information ahah [noise] 

271.49 277.07 A: exactly it's kind of like the newspaper you read it but you don't really know if it's true 

276.65 278.06 B: right well 

278.63 283.51 B: [mn] i think [mn] that probably most of what you read is not 

284.05 287.01 B: it it's for a readership [laughter] 

285.67 295.07 A: yeah for that you always kind of wonder you know how much you know meredith is all this taking and but i do think [noise] we have to be you know prepared 

295.32 298.28 A: i was reading something oh i don't know a week ago 

298.60 303.80 A: where somebody was saying you know we we probably never need to let let our guard down so we're not prepared to be 

304.22 309.60 A: you know barricade ourselves in our homes for a week we should have whatever we need 

309.75 313.77 A: not even knowing if that's going [noise] to be any good to us 

313.30 315.05 B: on bioterrorism 

314.20 319.99 A: yeah i don't because the i think the um if it's an anthrax or a 

315.21 316.35 B: mhm 

320.39 325.99 A: the i mean when you find out that you you have anthrax people think you have the flu or 

325.77 326.92 B: mhm 

326.39 327.56 A: something 

327.95 334.53 A: so that i know it throws everybody off i know that my husband is in the medical industry and i know that they're not trained 

334.55 338.02 A: they've just barely touched the topic you know 

337.10 340.60 B: because it's unfathomable for for 

338.99 340.23 A: yeah 

340.70 343.39 B: us as americans to comprehend that 

343.03 344.14 A: (( it is )) 

343.46 345.13 B: it's unfathomable [mn] 

345.33 346.93 B: i mean i i 

347.22 348.73 B: don't even [noise] 

350.48 353.58 B: if you knew and someone said um 

353.74 358.29 B: we're there we have war that there is going to be a biological warfare 

357.64 358.58 A: uh-huh 

358.82 365.00 B: within forty eight hours and it's going to hit washington state or north carolina 

364.47 365.62 A: mhm 

365.17 366.76 B: as in us 

368.95 373.36 B: [noise] how could you prepare how i mean duct tape isn't 

370.99 371.63 A: (( i'd )) 

372.30 374.23 A: be praying [laughter] i'd 

373.57 374.97 B: [laughter] really 

374.40 376.60 A: be praying really really hard 

375.62 382.53 B: there you go i mean it goes back to basics and i'm not quite sure 

376.69 379.38 A: i mean i don't that's my view 

383.37 384.63 B: (( i i mean )) 

384.73 385.78 B: the only thing [noise] 

387.75 390.90 B: the only thing the war would do in my opinion is to 

392.10 399.06 B: reinforce it you know that that we're very strong as americans we're very strong people and very proud people but 

396.20 397.06 A: yeah 

399.21 402.43 B: does that stop anything now it didn't stop nine eleven 

402.23 403.56 A: (( no and )) 

402.67 405.22 B: didn't stop anthrax 

403.88 405.96 A: yeah that's very true 

405.97 411.60 A: [noise] i think that um these other the thinking of the [mn] in the middle eastern countries 

411.56 422.49 A: their thinking is so different from ours because of their countries are different their living's different i mean even don't they don't they don't care the way we care about you know some things 

416.50 418.11 B: [noise] it's inbred in 'em 

422.60 432.23 A: [noise] but yet there's you know little villages they've got you know babies and kids and and they're i'm sure they're very afraid too of the prospect of the war and 

426.80 427.94 B: right 

431.59 435.52 B: well maybe that's what you know maybe as americans we should focus on 

435.78 439.70 B: those types of things too to make it for comforting to us 

439.19 440.16 A: yeah 

439.96 441.63 B: i have adult children 

440.21 440.89 A: (( but )) 

441.55 450.52 A: they're not all the terrorists that you see you know on t._v. and the and the men and there's you know mamas and grammas and babies and that's sad too 

448.01 452.67 B: exactly they're still ch children are children no matter where they're from 

452.36 453.75 A: exactly 

452.78 455.57 B: and families are families no matter where they're from 

454.90 455.91 A: yeah 

456.01 460.25 B: and i'm not quite sure how you go about that i do believe that [noise] 

462.26 465.62 B: probably need to make a stand with regard to war 

465.57 466.58 A: yeah 

465.84 467.21 B: and 

467.31 472.67 B: i i i hate to even think of myself saying that because i have adult sons 

472.06 473.06 A: yeah 

473.13 479.61 B: and i certainly would never want to live to see them have to go to a war but [noise] 

478.30 480.16 A: oh yeah it's 

481.05 483.44 B: i don't think that it's a frivolous 

483.47 489.38 B: war and and i guess back to the subject of bioterrorism i believe is what we're supposed to be talking about 

488.21 489.29 A: mhm 

489.39 491.08 B: i don't think we're prepared 

491.03 497.23 A: no i don't and i don't know what i don't know what our government can do to prevent that i think is what 

497.61 505.56 A: [noise] i don't know what they want us to discuss too and and i don't know what the government can do i don't know what what's even an option that's available 

505.92 516.02 B: well i would guess from in the beginning would be um and what i would think and and i could be totally off base and maybe you can help me with that is 

506.33 507.12 A: um 

507.17 509.06 A: i mean we can't cower 

517.19 520.51 B: [noise] with regard to our medical field 

520.96 525.90 B: being trained properly and how fast can you train someone if you i mean 

522.87 523.81 A: mhm 

526.47 531.41 B: an m._d. has to go to school for twelve years fifteen sixteen years 

530.80 531.80 A: mhm 

532.05 534.71 B: how fast can they be trained in [noise] 

536.62 542.61 B: in bioterrorism i you can't i mean you can't do it in a short amount of time 

537.79 538.81 A: yeah 

541.04 541.77 A: it's 

541.84 548.88 A: actually um you can't predict what it if it's bioterrorism or not and if there's no you know because the symptoms are so 

549.12 551.27 A: they cross over to other things 

551.33 554.84 A: to a lesser [mn] you know they're not going to know that it's a 

555.32 567.46 A: unless it's a nerve i don't know a nerve kind of um destruction something like that but a lot of these things that doesn't sound like it they start affecting your body for two or three days there are some that are you know the plague or 

567.68 571.20 A: there's so many different things that happen to our bodies that it 

571.25 576.54 A: would be [noise] hard to know what they're treating and then they're breathing you know the same things and 

577.60 587.18 A: [sigh] i don't even know where they can where they can start we're i would be in a mode of panic all the time and we i don't think we as americans we want we want we won't live like that as americans 

584.26 585.71 B: exactly 

586.31 587.24 B: (( no )) 

587.26 588.69 B: we can't 

587.96 589.90 A: we just won't do it 

589.21 590.53 B: we can't we 

589.98 590.92 A: no 

591.85 592.96 A: (( [noise] so i don't )) 

593.66 598.68 A: i wouldn't want that load that our president has on his shoulders 

593.72 594.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

598.11 599.89 B: no i certainly wouldn't either 

599.38 599.89 A: and
