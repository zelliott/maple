0.24 2.08 A: hi i'm dee 

1.71 3.35 B: hi dee i'm dan 

3.67 4.77 A: oh hi dan 

3.72 4.33 B: (( how )) 

4.67 5.97 B: (( you doing )) 

5.67 7.94 A: oh okay how are you i 

7.29 8.76 B: (( good thanks i )) 

8.12 10.78 A: see you got the late the late shift like me 

10.53 11.50 B: did to 

11.79 15.07 A: so what so what is the topic what can the u._s. do 

14.89 19.35 B: prevent bioterrorism attacks i think is what it 

15.52 17.24 A: to prevent bio terror- 

19.38 22.11 A: well how about close the borders [sigh] 

22.19 26.58 B: said well that that's a good idea yeah i 

26.00 30.61 A: let's start let's start with with close the borders and then figure out who's here 

30.48 35.25 B: that might not be the best idea unless it's are you saying like a temporary 

35.51 38.06 B: thing or are you saying like permanent 

35.52 38.84 A: well yeah you can't you can't be 

39.10 41.32 A: i don't think you can um 

42.36 49.05 A: you know it's sort of like pouring water into a bucket you're never going to know how much is in the bucket until you stop pouring water 

48.76 49.81 B: that's true 

49.89 55.62 A: so first first you gotta stop the people coming in then you figure out who's already here 

56.32 60.00 A: then you know from that point um 

61.10 62.99 A: i don't know because after that 

63.90 67.47 A: [mn] then i guess you have to get into like profiling or something 

67.44 69.76 B: (( yeah it's going to big brother )) 

68.84 71.83 A: how else could you how else could you 

70.42 72.58 B: big brother is going to come out [laughter] 

72.27 76.80 A: and then all of a._c._l._u. will be out going oh you're you're 

76.90 79.14 A: you know stopping their rights 

79.62 89.53 A: but you know what the whole point of society is that you have everybody gives up some freedom in order to make a safe s- place for everybody else for everyone 

86.85 87.55 B: (( i )) 

88.67 91.82 B: think i think closing the border would be pretty hard because 

91.92 95.86 B: you can't notify notify people that you are going to do it because then those people that 

92.13 93.12 A: yeah 

95.90 97.79 B: are up to no good are going to leave 

98.27 101.03 A: but you know what if they leave 

99.09 102.02 B: but if you don't then you're going to trap 

102.12 103.73 B: travellers here 

103.90 105.28 B: you know even 

104.43 112.85 A: well you would no you could leave i mean you could go out but you can't come back in you know what i mean you just stop people from coming in for right now 

113.37 115.40 A: and then if the bad people 

113.91 117.48 B: even our even our own citizens are somewhere else 

117.27 122.63 A: no citizens can always come back i'm talking about people who aren't citizens or aren't 

121.09 124.37 B: but there's many there's many citizens that are involved in 

124.63 127.13 B: in that big the big issue of the 

127.47 129.69 B: you know terrorist attacks and such 

129.79 130.87 B: many of them are 

130.11 134.68 A: well we're not saying they have to come back either wherever they are 

133.15 136.53 B: oh i i know but they could still is what i'm trying to say 

136.59 139.25 A: they could still yeah 

138.43 142.19 B: they could they could bring it back somehow bring something back or 

142.19 147.93 A: well but then but you know but now now we have a treason problem if that's the case 

142.60 143.45 B: (( i don't know )) 

146.15 147.03 B: true 

147.23 148.52 B: well i mean that's 

148.78 152.35 B: definitely what's going on like no doubt about it 

152.49 156.31 A: well we don't really have that much i mean the threat is not really 

156.36 158.46 A: treason so much do 

158.28 161.27 B: (( oh no but if you've got infighters everywhere )) 

158.84 160.64 A: you really think there's a lot of 

162.20 167.46 A: yeah you can never tell what [mn] anybody is actually doing but but i think 

167.97 170.31 A: i think the main 

171.70 176.02 A: threat of bio terror- terrorism isn't really coming from within 

176.79 184.37 B: right i understand what you're saying i agree on the on the i agree on that issue but i am just suggesting that there's ways to continue that threat 

183.10 185.25 A: well how would you start 

186.25 188.94 A: you know how would you start a prevention program 

189.06 194.05 B: honestly i don't know like i don't have any idea like i'd 

193.95 196.21 A: so you'd have to start somewhere 

195.62 200.44 B: i don't think a war is going to prevent any future attacks i think it might 

200.14 201.34 A: well i don't 

200.49 215.09 B: prevent an immediate an immediate you know um risk but it won't prevent them long term because they will always happen so if you're just looking at the immediate yeah this is probably a good idea but long term it's not really going to help it may just slow it slow it down 

203.30 204.23 A: right 

207.71 208.70 A: well 

210.36 211.66 A: mhm 

213.18 215.17 A: well yeah 

215.25 219.33 A: i i kind of agree with that because [sigh] it doesn't 

219.37 224.56 A: it doesn't matter how what you do outside if you're not protecting your own borders inside 

224.08 225.52 B: right 

224.91 230.95 A: it doesn't matter because look those guys were here and how did they get in here they just l- you know bsd the i._n._s. 

227.73 228.60 B: (( they just )) 

230.98 232.21 B: walked right in 

232.19 236.39 A: yeah they just walked if have you enough money you can get in that's already been proven 

235.29 238.51 B: and and many of them had been here for years 

237.86 238.72 A: yeah 

238.93 245.55 A: so so really we have to we have to revamp all of the i._n._s. people 

244.50 246.99 B: (( mm yeah [laughter] )) 

246.07 255.46 A: and the ones th- and really i don't think it's fair that there's people who are waiting to come in in a legal way and people just like run over the border and stuff 

256.10 256.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

256.47 264.41 A: and they overstay their visas and they do all these other things i mean i understand they want to be here but you know what everybody there's a lot of other people who are just as deserving 

259.58 260.49 B: (( that's )) 

264.49 273.14 A: who are following the rules so i don't think that's very fair for them because that gives everybody that's like rewarding the bad people 

274.62 278.12 B: true i agree with that that point 

277.69 283.05 A: and don't you think if you were going to be a bioterrorist do you think you'd be following the rules 

283.10 284.04 B: well 

283.25 283.92 A: [laughter] 

284.27 287.84 B: the actually that's that was what i was talking about like why 

287.79 293.52 B: you know maybe closing borders isn't the best idea because so many people will follow the rules and they will be able to get access 

293.45 306.17 B: you know thr- if you were able to keep the borders open to citizens you know so many of those people that are following the rules will be able to continue that threat because of that because they are following the rules and that's why it'd be hard 

305.51 306.58 A: right 

306.37 318.09 B: hard to weed out those people i think they are doing a pretty good job right now of just following leads and and you know making arrests like there was a big arrest either last week or the week before of of one of the instigators you know 

315.82 317.03 A: but that's because 

318.05 326.98 A: but that's because they've already cracked down on the borders they haven't closed they haven't closed them but all of a sudden now they're making they're actually looking at these people and stuff 

321.30 322.32 B: right 

323.07 324.17 B: (( that's true )) 

327.50 332.56 A: so because they have to because they know every eye in america is watching them 

332.61 333.81 B: right 

333.24 337.42 A: and god forbid something happens and it turns out to be another you know 

337.77 340.00 A: some where someone has come in 

338.04 339.45 B: it's only it's 

339.67 349.40 B: only a matter of time there's going to be some way i don't think there's a hundred per cent like guarantee that that nothing's going to happen i think it's more probable 

344.41 345.57 A: i don't think 

345.74 346.60 A: right 

347.57 355.04 A: it's more containment than anything else don't you think because you you probably won't be able to stop it there's always going to be some nut job out there 

349.85 350.78 B: right 

354.71 358.26 B: for sure and it's just that one person that it takes 

355.76 357.48 A: so because it yeah 

358.01 361.65 A: it only and and with bioterrorism you only need one guy 

361.21 362.81 B: right but it's going to be 

362.09 370.54 A: and they don- it's not even like they're in danger themselves you know they take it and dump it in the water supply or wherever and take off 

366.00 366.86 B: right 

370.44 373.22 B: right or the air you know there's airborne 

372.36 373.56 A: oh yeah 

373.51 375.52 B: viruses and all kinds of things 

373.70 374.60 A: (( you know )) 

375.75 380.90 A: and since we're just we're you know have been so friendly giving it all away to people it's 

380.00 381.33 B: [laughter] 

381.11 383.72 A: like oh here please have some anthrax 

383.12 384.10 B: yeah 

384.81 388.38 A: but so you know tha- i understand that that is also 

388.45 389.63 A: a problem but 

390.24 402.82 A: you know how else how else would you go about [mn] you'd have to start somewhere you and and maybe what they're doing now is good the- i mean they haven't really closed the border but they've really cracked down on who gets to come in and who's leaving 

401.41 405.89 B: right there's a lot more um security like national security going on 

403.09 404.25 A: right 

405.09 407.47 A: and that's how they're catching these people 

407.22 408.43 B: right 

407.75 414.01 A: because there's no other real i mean well i guess what they're doing is they're catching these people and they're not torturing them but they're 

413.27 414.19 B: [laughter] 

414.13 415.00 A: you know 

414.71 417.29 B: they're trying to get information [laughter] 

415.38 418.11 A: encouraging them to talk [laughter] 

417.37 420.69 B: right [laughter] and whatever means are necessary 

420.75 424.21 A: exactly well what say we caught one i mean would you 

424.86 429.81 A: would you support s- torturing him to get like more information out of the guy 

429.53 433.43 B: i i personally don't know how far i would go i i don't think i'd 

433.67 436.34 B: i would torture the person maybe 

434.58 435.70 A: i know 

435.77 436.35 A: (( [mn] )) 

436.49 444.33 B: maybe like you know s- starving them for a while or something you know making them go hungry for a while but i don't think i'd want to inflict pain upon them 

436.55 437.37 A: [laughter] 

443.53 447.72 A: exactly i don't want to be cutting off any body parts or anything like that 

446.09 449.30 B: i'm just glad i'm glad i don't have to make that decision 

449.30 455.86 A: yeah i'm with you there although i kind of like the tactic they're using now which is just sleep deprivation 

450.94 451.96 B: you gotta 

455.68 460.41 B: yeah like i understand like that's something that's not like a like a permanent physical 

459.80 466.26 A: yeah but what i worry about is you know how when you wake up and you're like all dopey because you haven't had enough sleep 

465.12 467.98 B: um you don't know what you're thinking [laughter] 

467.39 482.29 A: yeah you don't even know what you're saying [laughter] because they're like going wake up tell us stuff [laughter] and they're like do you know oh sure aha [laughter] yeah sure no problem aha [laughter] you know 

469.55 470.93 B: yeah for sure 

473.39 474.53 B: that's true 

479.50 481.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

482.94 489.98 A: i think maybe they should just like hook them up to a lie detector and load them up with sodium pen- pentothal and see what happens um 

490.13 494.26 A: because that's not you know that's not really dangerous i don't think 

494.31 500.90 B: probably not of course the lie detector people people are trained to be able to pass those like the military 

496.15 498.07 A: i don't think that would kill ya 

500.77 502.32 A: well that's true 

501.39 505.85 B: you know so some of them may not be able to have much of an effect on 

504.16 505.20 A: yeah 

506.22 507.48 A: that's true 

508.98 512.27 B: and they're not a hundred per cent accurate anyway [laughter] 

510.82 516.80 A: they're not no they're not and you can you can fool them if you know you've been trained 

512.77 513.53 B: (( but )) 

516.33 518.02 B: yeah good actor 

518.04 519.12 A: yeah 

519.50 526.03 A: well i think it has to do with how much you believe in what you're actually saying or or you know and then they you can give false um 

526.28 534.41 A: [lipsmack] you can make it jump by like sticking yourself with a needle and stuff you put like pins in your shoes and stuff 

531.59 532.70 B: oh right 

533.92 536.12 B: (( yeah i see what you're saying yeah )) 

535.51 542.35 A: so that you know it makes your heart rate go up and stuff and then they think oh he must be telling a lie here when his name is joe 

542.24 548.67 B: i hope i hope somebody's a lot smarter than i am so they can figure out how to how to solve this problem 

548.04 557.29 A: yeah i'm glad it's not me [laughter] so this because this is it's not it's not really solvable i mean it's it's not like you could really 

558.14 563.51 A: [mn] do more than contain it because you're ri- i think you're right there's always going to be 

561.26 567.03 B: but yeah i see i see what you mean like probably like the only only guarantee is to 

567.10 572.98 B: contain any external influence but then we have to worry about our own internal crazy people 

569.92 570.92 A: yeah 

572.09 574.13 A: right right because 

573.56 580.44 B: at least they'd be they'd cut the the um the number of people we worry about [mn] by a great number 

580.38 587.90 A: yeah at least that way we'd have a kind of a set kind of number that we're looking at because i i- 

586.39 587.33 B: right 

587.93 597.51 A: if you were going to do that kind of stuff it seems to me at some point you would slip up you know doing something you would kind of slip up somewhere where someone might go hm we 

597.80 599.89 A: oughta maybe check that guy i know that sounds like
