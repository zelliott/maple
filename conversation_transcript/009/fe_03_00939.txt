151.47 153.00 A: they would do kind of a a 

153.15 154.17 A: a random 

154.41 159.53 A: kind of almost secret santa thing where everybody in the family you now their names were written down and they would they would 

159.81 163.74 A: pick randomly who who would get a gift for somebody else and 

164.54 169.20 A: and it would actually have that the get together before christmas so it was a time you know to 

169.46 176.93 A: exchange gifts you know before actually christmas day came so so more children and all that that it was really exciting for us 

172.68 173.25 B: yeah 

176.80 181.43 B: yeah you know you kind of get the spirit i guess ahead of time huh 

180.64 183.93 A: mhm mhm and then and then for all the children 

181.59 182.01 B: (( )) 

184.04 185.36 A: that my grandparents would 

185.64 191.38 A: like trim the tree and have set out a basket with with ornaments and stuff on it for for every kid and 

191.57 195.15 B: huh really now that's neat a basket 

192.29 193.35 A: and it was yeah

195.52 196.30 B: oh

197.48 198.13 B: yeah 

199.40 206.85 A: an even number of ornaments for each kid to put up on the tree and and then everyone would sit down and have a huge dinner and 

203.37 204.26 B: oh 

206.93 209.55 B: so they saved putting the tree up until everybody got together 

209.66 210.55 A: yep 

210.52 211.43 B: that's fun 

210.71 213.66 A: well it would be up but they didn't decorate it you know 

212.30 212.67 B: yeah 

214.61 215.80 A: hm right right 

216.42 216.72 A: so 

216.91 217.49 A: yeah 

217.99 218.45 A: yeah 

221.35 222.14 A: there you go 

221.95 231.72 B: yeah i like that that sounds like fun and so so everybody would get together before christmas and then on christmas day did you stay in your own homes respectively 

227.01 227.44 A: mhm 

230.71 233.08 A: yeah that's basically how it worked you know we 

233.48 236.73 A: spent always had christmas day with with immediate family 

236.85 240.39 B: oh that's good then that's great then what did the grandparents do

240.92 242.28 A: what's that on christmas day 

241.49 243.08 B: what did your yeah 

242.81 243.58 A: um they would 

243.69 246.02 A: either you know visit one of their 

246.31 251.12 A: rela- they would have christmas by themselves together in the and then go out and visit 

249.44 250.31 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

251.03 252.61 B: yeah yeah okay 

251.75 255.01 A: you know because everybody you know years ago everybody in my family was 

255.57 258.06 A: relatively close around the same area 

257.97 259.13 B: yeah 

258.80 261.53 A: so uh it was easy to kind of just drop by and 

262.10 264.77 A: and now now everybody is kind of spread out but um 

265.45 270.93 B: huh and it it ga- are your family you say they are spread out are they all over the united states now 

270.15 272.14 A: um nope pretty much new england 

272.82 273.35 A: yeah 

275.26 275.75 A: wow 

279.09 290.92 B: they saw us travel you know we lived in north carolina and then we lived in new york state and we were born and raised in new york state moved to north carolina then moved back to new york then we moved to florida so now my kids think it's normal 

285.39 285.79 A: mhm 

286.42 287.26 A: mhm 

291.29 292.73 A: da- right 

293.16 293.67 A: right 

295.20 295.74 A: mhm 

295.51 296.96 B: student now and uh 

296.32 296.74 A: mhm 

297.66 309.47 B: uh it's just and they lived in uh salt lake for a while and so they've just kind of they're going to be all over and my other son is back in new york state and so it it's hard to get together even on the holidays 

308.96 310.10 A: right right 

311.99 316.73 A: see i'm glad that still a lot of my family is pretty much around the same area so 

316.57 317.07 B: yeah 

317.02 319.51 A: you know when the holidays come around it's always a good thing that 

317.19 317.53 B: yeah 

319.48 321.28 B: i think it's a wonderful thing 

321.06 321.66 A: yeah 

328.23 328.85 A: mhm 

329.37 329.76 A: mhm 

333.47 335.99 B: hm did you carry around the same decorating traditions are you 

339.81 342.92 A: no i'm not married yet but i live i live on my own 

340.79 341.62 B: yep so 

343.01 343.80 B: you're off on your own 

343.82 344.50 A: yeah 

344.35 352.14 B: that's fun i can remember when my kids did that they were off on their own for a while then my daughter came back (( )) 

345.30 345.61 A: hm 

348.95 349.41 A: uh-huh 

351.35 360.50 A: yeah well actually that's uh that's what i'm planning on doing i have one semester left so after i graduate i think i'm going to go back to my mom's house and just try to make some money and then move you know 

360.11 364.23 B: yeah that's really what you have to do that's the wise thing to do if you can get along and do that 

361.57 362.02 A: right 

362.68 363.20 A: yeah 

364.75 367.69 B: boy because it helps yo get out of the debt that you got in when you were a student 

366.90 371.54 A: well that's see that's what i want to do i want to go home and you know pay my credit cards off and 

371.84 376.37 A: and my lo- start paying my loans off and save up a little money and then go somewhere 

379.16 379.68 A: (( )) 

388.41 388.73 A: (( )) 

391.05 391.67 A: yeah 

394.66 395.87 A: so uh that's good 

397.09 402.05 A: yeah well that's that's my plan who knows if it's going to work out that way but 

400.87 408.45 B: yeah yeah so it when you have your own kids and your own family do you think you'll try to do the same thing go back to your mom and dad's house 

408.48 410.04 A: i hope so that would be great
