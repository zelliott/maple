5.49 7.25 A: so do you watch reality t._v. 

7.20 9.93 B: um yeah i usually watch like um 

10.05 16.21 B: joe millionaire or like one of those like kind of shows not really survivor but more of like the millionaire kind of shows 

16.16 16.64 A: yeah 

16.82 19.54 A: um honestly i really can't say i have 

19.61 20.01 B: uh-huh 

20.28 20.93 A: um 

21.10 21.52 A: like 

21.90 22.45 A: i've 

22.56 25.47 A: i've seen one the talk shows and stuff like that like on 

26.05 26.68 A: um 

27.36 35.33 A: kelly and regis and like stuff like that where they talk about -em and they show like clips of -em and you know from like jay leno showed clips from -em and stuff like that 

34.74 37.44 B: right when they have like the people on and they talk about it right 

36.34 37.42 A: right 

37.54 41.46 A: right but i've never actually well i work and stuff in the evening too but 
40.97 41.35 B: right 

41.97 44.08 A: i've never sat down and really watched one 

47.55 48.31 A: huh 

50.54 52.04 A: joe millionaire uh-huh 

55.06 57.00 A: right right that's true 

56.63 61.52 B: so it was kind of misleading like all these girls are like oh my god i'm going to marry this rich man 

61.17 62.12 A: uh-huh 

61.95 63.83 B: i mean well like it turns out 

63.05 66.02 A: so it was kind of comical like watching it too i'm sure 

65.64 75.01 B: yeah like all these girls are getting up their hopes and they are like oh this is my you know mister right and he is going to make my life better whatever i mean while he is like a construction worker 

72.60 73.21 A: uh-huh 

74.75 76.34 A: right right 

76.47 79.80 A: um yeah and i don't even think those two stayed together from what i've heard 

79.83 85.38 B: yeah they show like little clips saying that like he is a flirt and he is like running all around like fucking all these women 

84.14 84.73 A: uh 

85.56 90.07 A: aw he was a good looking guy it's not you know but um oh 

87.56 88.07 B: yeah 

88.96 90.60 B: but it is it is definitely misleading 

90.39 92.17 A: yeah and you know what um 

92.40 97.78 A: i think it was like inside edition or one of those where they were talking to him and he was talking about 

97.98 98.56 A: um 

98.77 101.03 A: how they had alcohol all the time 

101.09 101.64 B: right 

104.91 105.45 B: mhm 

117.18 122.49 B: right so it was like a constant party for them it wasn't really like they were actually doing a t._v. show it was just like a uh 

117.64 118.44 A: it was (( kind of )) 

119.23 120.03 A: right 

122.52 126.51 A: right and so they were kind of drunk the whole time or tipsy at least you know so 

123.92 124.41 B: mhm 

126.31 130.13 B: right so their personalities came out a little bit different than they normally would be 

128.40 129.36 A: right 

129.92 134.95 A: exactly it was see like i never really watch them so i thought that was kind of funny when i saw that because 

135.22 139.00 A: it's not just some show on t._v. it's like a reality show and they are that's what they are 

145.22 146.40 B: right right 

146.10 153.87 A: yeah a drink for breakfast and lunch and dinner and you know i don't you know and so it's just like what are they portraying there i thought it was just like interesting 

154.07 161.01 B: right and then also that guy that's on joe millionaire the butler supposedly now that show made him famous because 

157.86 158.46 A: (( )) 

161.14 162.88 B: he's getting other jobs or other 

163.22 164.27 A: oh really 

164.02 164.62 B: right 

164.46 166.10 A: see i didn't see him was he like 

166.25 167.80 A: good looking or something or he was 

167.07 170.32 B: no he was an older man but he just like had that like 

170.45 171.70 B: that butler image 

171.47 172.71 A: oh 

172.10 173.64 B: like he was i think he was from england 

173.76 174.60 A: oh 

174.20 176.11 B: and that was like his lifetime career 

176.12 178.26 A: oh huh okay 

177.43 184.83 B: so now because he did that i think he got a lot of other roles just in like movies and like t._v. shows just for acting like it did his career well 

180.64 181.16 A: huh 

184.85 186.14 A: oh that's cool 

186.05 186.51 B: mhm 

186.45 188.63 A: well that's something good that came out of that then at least 

189.05 189.49 B: right 

189.53 192.29 A: oh and i think that well from what i heard like the bachelorette 

192.74 195.31 A: that she is still with that guy the last that i heard 

195.13 195.57 B: uh-huh 

195.73 200.42 A: course the tabloids and stuff so why do you think they are so popular and that you know so many people watch -em 

208.13 212.06 B: if it was just like you or me and they all of a sudden throw you on t._v. and put you in a situation 

212.40 214.44 A: yeah you're right i think yeah i think that's 

214.66 215.47 A: that's probably 

215.54 218.21 B: it's like these circumstances make them famous 

218.15 220.06 A: right right that's true 

223.97 225.33 A: yeah uh-huh 

227.33 230.47 B: wilderness and say okay you know what's going to make you what's going to break you 

230.50 231.94 A: right that's true 

232.44 237.76 A: well i saw it too that one of those guys that was on survivor not too long ago i forget where they were at 

238.24 240.06 A: but he got malaria from it 

239.94 241.00 B: oh wow 

240.56 242.48 A: from being bit you know from a mosquito 

242.06 242.55 B: right 

242.98 246.94 A: yeah um he's not one of the you know he didn't win or anything but he 

246.26 252.47 B: but they make they put you through like such extreme circumstances like they had to like swallow bugs and like 

249.47 250.38 A: yeah they do 

252.79 253.51 B: go into 

252.94 256.66 A: and that was their only way that they could survive they really had to eat bugs and stuff 

255.20 262.78 B: yeah like no they put them through like these trials and tribulations and said well for your team to win a meal 

263.54 265.67 B: you have to like dig inside this 

265.87 269.39 B: pit of bugs and pull out like the envelope or something 

269.16 270.62 A: oh my gosh 

270.46 272.98 B: and that envelope contains your meal tickets 

273.08 274.27 A: oh 

274.45 280.20 B: so you have to like endure the bugs crawling up your arms and like jumping up at you trying to bite you 

280.38 281.42 A: right 

280.62 281.77 B: just to get a next meal 

281.98 284.54 A: sounds like really a test of you know your wits 

284.45 285.07 B: right 

284.70 286.41 A: you know and what kind of how much you 

285.88 289.10 B: what you can go through i think they had um melissa rivers 

288.77 289.20 A: mh- 

289.28 294.52 B: she was wearing these big clown pants and she had a um a 

291.45 292.28 A: mhm 

292.37 292.97 A: ah 

294.69 297.05 B: big like thing of i think they were 

297.25 303.93 B: i don't know what they were they were some kind of bugs oh i think they were rats yeah they were rats and she had to dump all the rats down her pants 

299.71 300.77 A: oh 

301.11 301.60 A: uh-huh 

303.89 305.16 A: oh my god 

304.50 312.10 B: but it wasn't her pants it was the clown pants but still like you feel them crawling on you and going up like the legs of the pants and stuff yeah 

306.51 307.15 A: uh-huh 

308.93 310.53 A: yeah yeah 

310.82 311.93 A: and she did it huh 

312.30 321.58 A: see that's the thing too i think because it's on t._v. you know you would probably be willing to do like a lot more just because you know like everybody is watching like 

321.39 326.34 B: right and you don't want to you don't want like people thinking less of you because you don't do what they expect 

326.13 331.14 A: right i think that would have something to do with it you know i mean i think i i probably 

331.52 334.23 A: would be willing to do a little bit more knowing that like 

334.61 337.57 A: you know the whole world would be watching me or something and 

336.72 339.01 B: right and you wouldn't make or break your career you don't want 

339.05 343.18 A: right right yeah i mean i would think so maybe not but i would think so 

343.49 345.69 A: just seeing it on t._v. that that would play a part 

346.23 347.88 A: and just knowing that everybody is watching 

348.06 350.50 B: but it just seems like every time you turn around there is a new show 

350.62 353.23 A: yeah yeah it is definitely the new fad now 

353.38 354.38 A: you know 

354.52 360.09 A: so and yeah that is interesting that you know people are getting into it but like you said i mean it's not scripted 

360.13 362.69 B: right it's like as it comes that's just 

360.23 361.24 A: you know it's not 

362.47 367.74 A: right and it's not seeing if people who are already well (( )) celebrities saying that 

367.60 368.09 B: mhm 

368.26 370.70 A: but that's cool too to throw them into something different 

371.05 371.64 A: you know 

371.21 376.22 B: right it keeps people watching oh i like this celebrity let's see what they what they are like off the screen 

373.94 374.35 A: ach 

375.91 379.30 A: right right yeah so um 

379.33 381.35 B: but see also they had robin leach 

379.43 380.00 A: yeah 

381.48 382.92 B: he was one of the celebrities 

382.95 383.66 A: oh yeah 

383.65 387.90 B: and then they kicked him off because they said that he was like a father figure 

388.35 389.01 A: oh 

389.03 398.08 B: and so like he knew more than like the other people of how to survive outside like in the wilderness and like little te- tech blah and like little tricks and techniques 

398.24 399.86 A: because he was a father figure 

399.63 402.28 B: because he was older than all of the rest of the people 

401.02 401.64 A: oh 

402.38 403.07 A: oh 

402.71 407.41 B: so like he would cook them meals and like i guess he just had like more experience 

405.13 405.91 A: oh 

407.16 408.48 A: oh huh 

408.32 411.12 B: so they kicked him off because they said that he 

411.40 412.87 B: could help them to survive 

412.83 413.65 A: oh 

413.31 415.02 B: that they relied on him too much 

415.06 415.72 A: huh 

416.85 417.36 A: well 

417.61 420.13 A: well i i guess that kind of makes sense i suppose 

420.71 426.40 A: i mean i don't watch it but to me it seems that they would want somebody like that to help them to survive 

425.89 428.57 B: yeah but i think that it was also like survival of the fittest 

428.38 429.67 A: oh okay 

429.69 432.35 B: so he was kind of bringing them down because they weren't 

432.95 436.29 B: i guess doing to performing to their fullest potential or whatever 

435.99 437.77 A: oh okay i see 

438.16 441.93 A: so then isn't it that it comes down to like one person left or something like that 

441.24 445.21 B: right the -m the person that i guess could survive on their own in the wilderness 

445.10 446.34 A: oh what 

445.90 447.58 B: or in the outback or wherever it was 

446.60 448.06 A: well how does it work with getting the 

448.32 450.30 A: voting people off the team members 

449.78 451.71 B: i think no i think it's um 

451.80 453.40 B: i think they leave it up to the public 

453.59 454.44 A: oh 

454.13 457.96 B: i think each person i think that's what it is each person has like a number 

458.03 458.63 A: mhm 

458.53 459.48 B: like on their shirt 

459.70 460.42 A: mhm 

459.92 467.81 B: and so there would be like a phone number you would call and say okay for today do you think who do you think is the weakest link kind of thing 

467.52 469.24 A: oh okay 

469.38 476.72 A: so i think that well that would probably play a part too is people being so interested in it because now they are participating in t._v. too 

474.85 477.13 B: right and they have a say in what happens 

476.88 478.24 A: right right 

477.54 479.84 B: that's also one of the newest shows i think um 

480.08 485.83 B: um not american idol but one of those like um those singer things those um who is like the next future star 

485.97 487.32 A: uh-huh not american idol 

487.24 489.56 B: no not american idol is it american idol maybe 

489.33 490.53 A: yeah american idol 

489.68 490.74 B: that you can call in 

491.06 495.39 A: oh i i think i don't see i don't really watch that either 

499.69 505.29 B: sing or talent show or whatever and then you can call in and say who do you think wins or who do you think has the 

504.11 504.95 A: oh 

505.54 507.29 B: the biggest potential to be a star 

507.08 509.49 A: oh okay okay um 

509.61 512.14 A: yeah like even that uh american idol i
