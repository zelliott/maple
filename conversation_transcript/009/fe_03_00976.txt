40.87 42.52 B: just don't do it 

42.00 45.05 A: right that's a good prevention measure 

44.83 47.71 B: i'm i'm not exactly sure because 

48.51 50.17 B: you know as far as 

51.70 55.70 B: you know with all the things that like for example that happened on nine eleven 

55.49 56.51 A: yeah 

55.93 56.98 B: (( i'm )) 

58.21 63.46 B: assuming that preventative measures were in place for you know something like that to take place 

63.09 64.04 A: right 

64.05 67.48 B: to guard against you know something like that to take place so 

68.62 69.91 B: i don't know 

72.03 75.64 B: i really don't know enough about it to 

75.21 80.17 A: yeah there's just so many ways that it could be prevented 

80.93 83.21 A: from so many different angles 

82.88 84.01 B: right 

84.27 85.17 B: (( yeah )) 

84.38 86.05 A: and [laughter] 

85.36 88.15 B: because there's so many different angles you can you know 

88.32 89.62 B: approach 

89.69 94.66 B: you know the situation i mean i would imagine the first first thing 

89.84 90.97 A: yeah 

95.07 100.30 B: i guess that i would that comes to mind is water supply 

99.99 100.90 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

100.66 101.97 B: (( and )) 

102.66 104.71 B: i remember i 

105.48 107.17 B: (( remember )) 

107.75 109.82 B: seeing some things on the news 

109.99 111.07 B: about 

112.87 114.88 B: the food supply also 

115.00 116.87 B: you know as far as 

118.11 119.63 B: as far as 

120.01 121.17 B: whole 

123.04 131.06 B: how things are chemically treated you know in the you know the farms farm land and things like that 

129.08 129.93 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

131.08 132.28 B: (( and )) 

133.06 136.06 B: you know i would imagine to you 

137.26 138.08 B: (( know )) 

138.65 141.62 B: i guess maybe to get 

141.65 143.60 B: a centralized place 

144.57 148.97 B: okay this company what is the name of this company i'll think of it in a minute cargill 

149.46 151.73 B: cargill have you ever heard of that company 

151.21 153.67 A: um it sounds familiar 

153.54 164.66 B: i think cargill is a company that specializes in growing you know food and things like that and i think that's what they do they specialize in growing food they specialize in 

158.61 159.52 A: uh-huh 

164.70 169.77 B: trying to feed you know feed people and i 

172.64 177.49 B: would imagine they would probably have something to do something to do 

178.10 182.62 B: with treating you know the type of chemicals they needed to preserve food you know 

183.22 185.79 B: you know whatever they do you know whatever 

186.15 187.66 B: it does to help 

187.46 200.30 A: there's so many situations when you can't control it because first of all you can't grow things on a very well the way that we've always approached agriculture in this country you know for the past 

198.33 199.47 B: mhm 

200.57 205.71 A: however long we've been here is to grow everything in an open field and 

202.34 203.15 B: right 

205.11 206.36 B: right 

205.75 206.61 A: there's 

206.63 208.51 A: very few 

208.73 210.36 A: situations where 

210.53 212.70 A: food could be mass produced 

212.89 213.89 B: mhm 

213.19 220.01 A: in enclosures or with some sort of protection from like airborne agents or 

219.97 220.99 B: yeah 

220.44 223.75 A: agents in the ground and i don't know 

222.07 223.22 B: mhm 

224.66 231.03 A: there's so many different angles there's really not one person who's ever going to have the answer and all we can do is 

231.09 234.90 A: just prepare as best we can i don't know 

233.51 234.43 B: yeah 

234.83 239.25 B: all right you know as the general public i don't know 

239.56 241.87 B: you know what it is 

242.25 243.78 B: that we can do 

243.58 244.68 A: yeah 

244.36 249.46 B: you know there's no way to test there's no way to you know 

249.03 253.18 A: yeah it's kind of like well once it happens then you find out 

253.57 254.58 B: right 

254.38 257.46 A: yeah but also like the water supply 

257.13 258.42 B: mhm 

258.43 261.97 A: here we get our water from rivers 

262.16 274.83 A: from the chattahoochee river in particular and but in other parts of the country like i'm from california originally and we got all of our water from aquifers that were under the ground and 

268.03 268.94 B: mhm 

274.02 275.16 B: from where 

274.82 278.31 A: from aquifers it's like underground lakes 

278.50 279.44 A: (( that )) 

280.08 286.22 A: like when the snow melts and it goes underground yeah it's just called an aquifer and 

281.65 283.75 B: (( oh okay okay )) 

286.49 289.08 A: so there's different ways that 

289.29 295.72 A: we get water in this country and i'm not so sure that we could ever be one hundred per cent 

295.86 297.84 A: sure about it not being 

297.61 298.58 B: mhm 

297.91 299.75 A: touched by any sort of 

300.30 302.33 A: bio agent you know 

301.68 303.32 B: mhm 

304.47 306.74 B: yeah like i said i 

306.93 309.13 B: wouldn't even i wouldn't even 

310.10 311.98 B: know where to begin 

311.42 312.42 A: yeah 

314.75 316.59 B: i don't know how 

319.43 322.94 B: what's the word i'm looking for i'm not i don't know how 

325.75 327.57 B: at this point how 

328.49 332.68 B: i don't know what the level of desire would be 

332.39 333.37 A: yeah 

333.17 335.45 B: from any terrorist group 

335.50 336.53 B: (( ifah- )) 

337.50 338.60 B: (( ifum- )) 

338.69 340.82 B: to try something different now 

341.26 352.52 A: yeah that's true you have to wonder like especially they have to get this stuff from somewhere first of all so maybe that's a way that it could be prevented by restricting the access 

352.44 362.07 B: yeah and and and and i guess shortly after nine eleven with all the arrests they were making as far as the people in al qaeda and things like that you know 

353.60 354.48 A: (( you know )) 

362.79 364.81 B: at least they were reporting on 

365.55 367.27 B: putting a stranglehold 

368.08 372.18 B: on you know their you know passing of information and um 

372.30 379.84 B: and ah you know things like that and and i think that i think that um 

380.30 381.28 B: um 

381.33 387.72 B: you know the belief was that um certain things wouldn't you know take place 

387.73 392.88 B: or or couldn't take i shouldn't say they wouldn't take place 

387.94 389.08 A: yeah 

392.31 394.65 A: yeah no one would dare to do it 

394.19 404.75 B: but you know something on that level again but i'm not exactly sure about that i think that you know obviously you know if you have like a 

395.87 396.69 A: right 

405.28 409.05 B: i don the best way i know how to put it is a kamikaze attitude 

407.99 409.71 A: yeah exactly 

411.38 418.33 B: you know you know you're going to in your own country you're going to be a hero you're going to 

418.84 421.30 B: you know die a martyr and you know 

420.59 421.75 A: mhm 

422.14 423.63 B: and and 

423.78 429.20 B: i guess that brings honor and everything on your family and you know whoever remains 

429.53 437.14 B: all kinds of things i really don't understand but but you know just like in our culture 

437.67 439.50 B: you know you um 

439.55 444.24 B: um you know the younger generation i mean i don't know how young you are 

445.37 447.68 A: i'm twenty four so 

445.76 447.70 B: [laughter] okay 

447.82 451.35 B: really well maybe even younger than that then 

448.39 449.90 A: (( yeah )) 

450.75 452.73 A: [laughter] 

451.68 464.89 B: because i have a i have a son about your age yeah and [laughter] my wife's laughing at me [laughter] we both have kids about your age but the 

454.88 456.08 A: oh really 

459.76 462.19 A: oh [laughter] 

463.01 464.65 A: oh okay 

465.64 467.90 B: younger generation in thinking 

468.43 471.65 B: that you know they are so heavily influenced 

471.93 482.45 B: by you know what they see what's going on and things like that so they try to emulate and i was suspected in that in that respect that it's no different in 

483.02 485.58 B: some of these middle east countries that harbour 

486.69 487.96 B: the you know 

488.68 491.81 B: large pockets of the terrorist groups 

491.43 492.42 A: yeah 

492.92 499.75 B: that they see that you know what happened on nine eleven and they grow up they want to be like that you know and so 

497.84 498.72 A: right 

500.77 502.34 B: i really
