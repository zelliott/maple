34.29 38.71 A: i understand the subject is bio-terrorism and what we think that uh 

38.89 41.94 A: we can do about preventing a bio-terrorist attack 

42.41 45.94 B: okay and so you want me to respond to what do i think we can do 

46.02 46.40 A: mhm 

49.54 50.96 B: have a few moments i'm 

51.12 51.59 B: i'm not 

51.40 53.90 A: well while you are thinking let me give you a little background 

52.45 53.01 B: yes 

54.07 55.21 A: a little of my background 

54.96 55.72 B: okay 

55.96 61.18 A: this is a great subject for me i work for the f._d._a. and i work in the center for biologics 

61.29 67.79 A: and they deal with vaccines and one of our big efforts right now is the bio-terrorism thing 

61.69 63.26 B: okay 

66.78 68.87 B: okay 

68.72 70.98 A: i'm not intimately concerned with it 

71.61 76.91 A: but i know that there is a lot of emphasis being put on it and i know that our troops have been vaccinated 

77.55 78.23 A: and 

78.45 79.60 A: um given 

80.73 83.96 A: as much protection as they can get before they go over there 

83.92 84.47 B: okay 

84.64 88.37 A: i don't know what is going to be done on the local scene but it's a big concern of mine 

90.03 90.78 B: for me 

91.06 94.66 B: i think and and i'm obviously a late person i do not have 

95.08 96.57 B: relatives or 

96.95 97.46 B: friends 

97.60 102.97 B: close friends who are being deployed although i do have some um people who i know 

103.37 104.57 B: uh remotely 

105.25 105.66 B: um 

106.63 107.45 B: and so 

108.10 112.25 B: i have i have a very benign concern i don't believe that it's 

113.16 114.57 B: and and i'm well read 

114.82 116.09 B: i don't believe 

116.22 116.58 B: that 

116.72 117.99 B: anything is going to come 

118.14 119.34 B: of that 

119.99 120.97 B: however 

121.49 122.45 B: i am happy 

122.84 123.91 B: that the government 

124.31 124.63 B: is 

124.82 125.80 B: making 

126.09 129.53 B: um is is making it a primary concern because 

130.10 130.71 B: uh even 

130.90 131.35 B: even 

132.23 134.25 B: a hint of that kind of 

134.64 135.79 B: um trouble 

135.96 137.37 B: that kind of terrorism 

137.96 138.27 B: um 

138.50 140.26 B: can be dangerous and 

140.56 144.30 B: each and every person is a valuable life so while 

144.93 147.55 B: intuitively i don't believe that it is going to happen 

148.15 150.96 B: the government is doing the right thing by being protective 

151.37 155.16 A: well tell me this have you have you gone out and bought plastic and duct tape 

155.78 156.16 B: no 

156.76 162.13 B: no i'm i'm definitely not one of those kinds i i'm not the type of person that is going to 

162.38 163.94 B: stress out over this kind of thing 

164.15 169.53 A: well it i don't think it would do you any good anyway i can't imagine sealing off my house 

169.96 172.23 A: and it wouldn't you know uh 

170.27 170.61 B: no 

171.80 173.74 B: no you know however if if 

172.80 176.27 A: it's been a big joke in this area i'm from the baltimore washington area 

176.11 176.56 B: okay 

177.28 177.86 A: where do you live 

178.64 180.17 B: i'm in pasadena california 

180.36 181.31 A: oh my goodness 

181.47 183.68 B: you mean you don't have my bio in front of you 

183.68 184.27 A: no 

184.41 186.52 B: gee i guess i'm just a number to you 

186.64 187.19 A: well um 

187.70 188.87 A: do you have mine 

189.34 189.97 B: no 

190.08 192.27 A: okay 

193.02 198.51 A: we just happened to be two strangers that passed in the night i used to live in california for a little while 

198.80 199.32 B: okay 

199.84 202.18 A: but that was a long time ago when my kids were little 

202.42 205.13 A: but no i there has been a 

205.57 208.30 A: a more of a panic mode i think in the 

208.41 208.90 A: in the 

209.47 213.01 A: area surrounding us just because of where we are 

212.86 214.67 B: absolutely yes i i 

221.16 225.75 A: everybody was going out and buying all this heavy sheet of plastic and duct tape 

226.22 229.15 A: in preparation to seal off one room of their house 

230.36 231.50 A: and one 

231.91 236.36 A: and th- this is not anything i've learned from work this is something i know for a fact 

237.26 240.62 A: the only place i can seal off completely would be my bathroom 

240.93 244.30 A: and i don't think i'd last very long in there with no air 

244.28 245.97 B: no but i think 

245.57 247.28 A: so i'll take my chances 

246.23 246.74 B: yeah 

247.53 249.04 B: i understand and (( )) 

248.35 250.27 A: if it's my turn it's my turn 

250.90 251.98 B: right i'm i'm 

252.13 255.14 B: not i'm not um a fatalist like that 

255.62 256.05 B: um 

256.93 258.69 B: but i'm but yet i'm not um 

258.90 260.41 B: i'm not um someone who is going to 

260.92 264.05 B: panic therefore i i'm somewhere in the middle a fatalist is 

264.36 266.34 B: my my opinion is is 

266.75 267.14 B: uh 

267.85 269.64 B: e- emulates what you just said i- 

271.05 274.95 B: by that i mean when it is my turn it is my turn that is the way it is 

275.11 282.40 A: well that is the only way i can uh can handle this see my daughter and her husband and my two of my babies are in england 

275.28 276.11 B: i don't 

276.35 276.66 B: hm 

283.95 286.14 A: and they are not in a good location 

284.20 284.53 B: boy 

286.23 290.84 B: well england seems to be our only major supporter here you know 

290.69 291.51 A: i know 

291.87 293.34 B: um but i i definitely 

294.05 294.89 B: um think 

295.14 296.88 B: i definitely think that the government must 

297.60 297.95 B: um 

298.10 301.88 B: must be very alert and very pro-active on this 

302.24 304.94 B: because if not what is the consequence the consequence 

305.66 306.91 B: is um 

307.09 308.78 B: i- it can be it can be um 

309.48 309.90 B: um 

310.07 310.97 B: fatal 

311.23 311.72 B: and 

312.21 313.40 B: it can also 

313.55 315.44 B: uh just imagine if the government 

315.83 317.58 B: didn't take this threat seriously 

317.72 318.81 B: and something did happen 

319.21 321.68 B: uh we the citizens would ram it down their throat 

322.34 323.47 B: so they have to protect 

322.49 325.68 A: if there was anybody to ram the if there was anybody 

325.87 328.13 A: throat to ram down 

326.07 327.08 B: yes yes 

327.50 336.67 B: right right but um i'm looking at bio-terrorism as something that that would be if it were to happen would be more localized i'm not looking at it as a as a 

336.86 338.36 B: you know armageddon like a world 

338.73 340.22 B: you know like a major world 

341.12 341.97 B: fate you know 

342.85 343.93 A: well it th- 

344.34 347.77 A: things like the anthrax and thing i guess um 

348.08 351.30 A: dissipates in the air after a certain amount of time 

352.08 352.35 B: yup 

352.35 354.70 A: and yes i'm sure there would be lives lost 

355.27 355.91 A: and i think 

356.04 359.55 A: that that is just an absolute horror to even consider 

360.66 362.94 A: but like i i you know i'll look at it like this 

363.67 368.86 A: we have a job that needs to be done this is one of the few things that i agree with the president about 

369.11 369.70 B: uh-huh 

369.72 371.37 A: something has to be done 

372.18 374.83 A: it should have been done when his father was president 

375.91 376.87 A: but it wasn't 

376.99 381.96 A: and now it is up to him i don't envy the man i wouldn't want to be in his position 

382.40 384.17 A: him or tony blair either one 

385.12 386.00 A: and uh 

386.69 388.53 A: you know i have i have very strong 

388.99 391.37 A: beliefs and thoughts and i uh 

391.51 392.65 A: have a lot of faith 

393.73 394.39 A: and 

395.35 396.72 A: i don't believe 

397.49 401.53 A: that it is in the overall plan and i believe there is an overall plan 

401.80 403.62 A: and i'm not in charge of it thank heavens 

404.56 405.81 A: but um 

406.30 415.61 A: i l- i a firmly believe you know that if we approach it with a fatalistic approach we are all going to be so miserable and there is going to be so many people that 

411.50 411.84 B: uh-huh 

415.75 418.88 A: just go in to a blind panic and all i can think of is 

419.40 422.29 A: if there is even a real real real bad threat of it 

423.00 425.18 A: what is that going to do to the elderly people 

423.01 423.42 B: uh-huh 

425.12 425.72 B: ah 

425.87 426.86 B: yeah 

426.37 427.69 A: and then nothing happens 

429.12 429.39 B: right 

429.49 438.51 A: i mean all of these things go around in my mind a lot and i guess it's because i live in this area and it is such a a topic of conversation 

439.04 444.35 A: it's in the news it's in the papers it's in everybody talks about it at work 

445.48 445.78 B: yeah 

445.51 447.14 A: i wouldn't even want to be 

447.27 447.80 A: uh 

449.14 451.90 A: the commissioner of the f._d._a. at this point in time 

452.00 452.51 B: oh 

452.81 455.17 B: yeah i know i know i know 

455.43 456.76 B: well presently at this point 

457.16 459.68 B: i'm not working but i did work for a 

460.30 460.66 B: um 

460.85 465.40 B: a major university in los angeles and um we've got 

465.60 466.63 B: we've had uh um 

467.31 469.63 B: a noble prize winner we've had just um 

469.91 470.49 B: scientific 

471.13 473.67 B: um geniuses working at the university 

474.08 475.01 B: i actually 

475.42 476.40 B: i'm i 

476.72 477.81 B: i have two 

478.71 479.45 B: methods 

480.14 482.68 B: i have two ways to think of this kind of thing 

483.31 484.58 B: one is that there are 

484.71 485.59 B: so many w- 

485.80 487.04 B: i mean incredibly 

487.87 489.75 B: intelligent geniuses 

490.09 490.84 B: working on 

490.98 492.08 B: problems like this 

492.52 492.87 B: that 

493.20 497.63 B: i feel confidant that whatever must be done is being done 

498.70 500.40 B: and that and like yourself 

500.78 505.27 B: i don't want to have to be one of those people that is at the forefront to have to worry about it 

505.83 507.02 B: um on the other hand 

507.19 511.05 B: i also know that in this world it's every man for himself i 

511.18 516.18 B: see too many elderly people i um used to had a clinic at the university 

516.51 517.73 B: and uh the university had a 

517.86 522.39 B: department of gerontology i see too many older people who are not taken care of 

523.49 523.89 B: um 

524.31 527.20 B: i see too many people who aren't being taken care of 

527.94 529.73 B: even by the government 

529.96 532.75 B: so i have this kind of dichotomy of thought 

533.04 533.81 B: one is that 

534.12 539.83 B: i i'm leaving it all to the geniuses to the scientists to the you know winners of all of these um 

539.97 540.82 B: prizes 

541.58 546.60 B: you know the incredibly intelligent people to solve these things i'm just not sure bush is one of them 

548.27 549.65 B: you know 

548.95 552.59 A: well unfortunately he is the one that is in the position right now
