0.82 2.35 B: ah this is snow 

2.98 4.59 A: i'm sorry what was your name 

4.27 5.30 B: snow 

5.41 6.43 A: (( snow )) 

6.13 6.92 B: ahah 

6.66 8.23 A: my name is wanda 

7.95 8.91 B: wanda 

8.88 9.77 A: yeah 

9.39 10.73 B: how are you doing today 

10.48 13.14 A: i am doing quite well how are you doing 

12.76 13.54 B: (( ah )) 

13.94 15.73 B: nervous about this call 

15.77 17.17 A: [laughter] 

16.09 17.92 B: first time i've done it [laughter] 

17.67 19.51 A: my first time too 

19.74 21.09 B: (( okay )) 

20.34 24.17 A: so we don't need to be worried we can just relax 

24.27 25.67 A: and talk 

25.21 26.36 B: yes 

27.05 29.16 B: do you think hussein will use 

30.35 32.58 B: bioterrorism on the troops 

34.23 43.77 A: i really have mixed emotions because i really don't believe that ah you know it will do any good to have any kind of a war 

44.22 48.35 A: it never does it never solves any problems 

45.53 46.31 B: no 

48.59 50.32 B: i agree with you on that 

50.51 51.59 A: i 

51.83 57.30 A: don't know i just see that ah the problems still remain 

57.32 59.94 A: sometimes they take on a new name 

60.37 67.05 A: but basically we don't accomplish anything by going to war except killing off our people 

68.13 69.05 B: yes 

68.32 71.81 A: and i think that is a wrong thing to do 

73.25 74.45 A: do you have 

73.34 78.59 B: well do you have any idea as wha like they said what we could do to prevent it 

78.81 79.59 B: the 

79.68 83.10 B: attacks on the u._s. or either our troops 

83.40 90.54 A: i don't really think it would make any difference for us to try because i don't feel that you know 

91.13 94.35 A: bin laden it would give us that opportunity 

95.45 101.34 A: and he's not out in the open where we can talk to him and try to reach a compromise 

102.18 103.55 A: what do you think 

105.27 107.46 B: well personally i think that ah 

109.89 111.91 B: like you said no matter what we do 

112.17 113.30 A: right 

113.20 114.25 B: that uh 

114.88 117.76 B: if we ever attack iraq 

118.21 119.91 B: that he's going to use it 

120.90 121.81 A: right 

121.22 124.10 B: it's not going to accomplish anything but he's going to use it 

124.16 129.89 B: and as far as trying to prevent it here in the united states or either what we could do with it 

130.54 134.59 B: they say use uh plastic the duct tape and all 

134.47 135.49 A: mhm 

134.86 137.42 B: i don't see where that would do anything 

138.35 139.58 A: do you think 

138.38 140.80 B: because you still have to live and 

140.37 141.53 A: right 

141.24 147.42 B: once you take the duct tape and the plastic down or either go outside then you've defeated everything you you know 

148.27 159.11 A: do you think we are going to be at war over there or do you think that the united states is going to be attacked over here and we would have problems here 

158.93 162.73 B: oh definitely if we ever attack over there they're going to hit us here 

165.11 167.12 B: i don't see any way out 

165.28 167.68 A: are you real worried about that 

167.75 169.41 B: i worry about it i 

169.44 172.02 B: have a son that's a career marine 

172.15 173.84 A: oh my gosh 

173.40 175.07 B: (( uh yeah )) 

174.88 178.93 A: yeah and where do you live you sound like you're from the south 

178.35 179.76 B: i'm at alabama 

179.91 181.29 A: alabama 

180.82 181.55 B: ahah 

181.70 182.99 A: okay 

183.22 184.44 B: but um 

184.80 187.63 B: as i said i don't see any way out of it 

188.37 189.36 A: no 

189.35 190.07 B: if 

190.45 193.99 B: hussein doesn't get us to me in my opinion korea will 

195.58 197.84 B: so we're going to have a war no matter what 

195.77 196.73 A: yeah 

198.70 203.52 A: well i think that is unfortunate but i really do think that's where we're headed 

205.34 206.19 B: but 

206.40 207.85 B: terrorism 

208.18 210.37 B: especially with the germ warfare 

210.58 211.76 B: all that 

211.99 214.52 B: there's nothing you can do to prepare for it 

214.86 215.83 A: no 

216.46 220.10 B: the anthrax i mean this has now been proved with 

220.27 221.72 B: (( when i was four )) 

221.79 222.91 A: mhm 

222.72 223.50 B: so 

224.79 228.89 A: and i don't even think that you can get into any kind of a uh 

229.19 235.49 A: [mn] like what do they call those you know underground bomb shelters and things like that you can't live there 

235.25 238.82 B: well now that the air still gets to you so 

235.60 236.43 A: (( you know )) 

238.74 239.83 A: yeah 

239.38 240.75 B: and that's where it's at 

242.25 250.37 A: so i guess we're just kind of stuck with it and try to make the best of it and uh you know hope that um 

250.47 252.73 A: we do survive and 

254.16 260.66 A: i don't worry about it quite so much i worry about it more for other people than i do myself 

261.21 262.34 A: um 

265.24 270.71 A: we live in hawaii and i don't think that that's going to be attacked as readily 

270.75 271.92 B: no i don't think 

272.62 278.61 A: so i don't worry about it quite so much but i hate to see any of our troops going in 

278.95 285.70 A: any of our young you know young people going in to fight it because i know a lot of them won't come home 

285.84 286.96 B: this is true 

285.88 286.83 A: and 

287.88 289.25 A: i'm sorry go ahead 

288.80 289.90 B: this is true 

290.27 291.28 A: yeah 

290.80 294.33 B: about the young people i mean you got all these 

295.62 298.81 B: i talk to my son so far he hasn't gone over 

299.49 304.03 B: he's been in there he doesn't have not four more years to go before he retires 

299.59 300.55 A: well i 

303.80 304.77 A: mhm 

304.11 306.87 B: but so far he hasn't been sent over there 

307.58 312.91 B: but he sees all the young guys that's got the babies and the wives and 

313.42 315.03 B: he says it's heartbreaking 

315.31 316.37 A: yeah 

317.43 320.88 A: well i do have a neighbor who has a son already over 

320.96 323.03 A: there and um 

323.10 326.67 A: you know they've already had to send the family home 

326.68 327.32 B: (( yeah )) 

327.27 332.25 A: and they're you know contemplating i guess closing down the 

333.71 335.01 A: (( embassy )) 

336.50 340.27 A: where he is at least somewhere in that area 

340.29 348.34 A: and you know she's being very guarded as to where he is and what's going on because he can't tell her very much 

348.03 348.82 B: no 

349.05 349.78 B: no 

349.08 354.59 A: and so it's hard to know but you just know that you know that it is not 

354.60 355.76 A: good 

356.00 362.64 B: definitely is not anything that's going to just like w any of the wars we've had nothing come out of it good 

362.65 363.56 A: (( [mn] )) 

363.12 365.26 B: yes we did keep our freedom 

365.97 368.68 B: and that is worth fighting for no matter what 

369.90 371.18 A: that's true 

372.03 378.24 B: and when the guys sign up for the military like my son said they know the possibility's there 

381.02 384.28 B: and he's upset because he hasn't been sent but [sigh] 

384.60 387.66 B: come on give mum a break i went through desert storm with him 

388.02 389.13 A: yeah 

390.51 395.52 A: do you really kind of hope that they can stay home and i do hope that all of them 

396.13 401.43 A: you know in the long run will be able to stay home but i do not see that 

401.48 402.18 B: no 

402.02 403.25 A: occurring 

403.35 404.47 B: (( i don't )) 

404.12 407.66 A: and it looks more and more every day like 

407.70 408.62 A: you know 

408.66 410.84 A: it will go on um 

411.92 415.55 A: do you think that there is any kind of a solution at all 

417.08 418.65 B: personally i don't 

420.22 421.26 B: because 

421.40 426.71 B: there's between afghanistan and iraq iran 

428.24 429.33 B: i mean is 

429.40 432.83 B: they've done this for years and years this is their way of life 

432.92 434.39 B: is fighting war 

434.00 435.05 A: mhm 

436.61 440.18 B: and i mean i just don't see any solution to it 

440.41 441.82 B: they're not going to 

442.92 444.65 B: stop because of us 

445.35 446.40 A: yeah 

445.85 447.31 B: living in the united states 

448.91 460.12 A: no because we differ in our ideas and a lot of that has to do with either religion or language or geography or 

451.48 452.39 B: that's it 

460.19 461.40 A: you know [mn] 

461.58 465.71 A: there's no way we could all agree on the same things 

466.04 473.17 A: because of our history and you know our surroundings our environment 

473.54 479.10 A: and therefore we will have different you know differing opinions 

479.58 486.02 B: well i don't understand the islam religion i mean i haven't read up on it that much 

486.50 490.32 B: (( but they they're saying you know they're )) 

490.82 493.59 B: doing it in the name of their religion 

494.22 497.46 B: well our religion does not teach us to go to war 

498.81 504.32 A: no but you know it doesn't matter which of the religions that you would pick 

504.74 507.78 A: none of 'em would dictate that 

508.92 517.10 A: so even basing it on a religion or basing it on politics or you know no matter what they're basing it on 

517.31 520.24 A: it doesn't seem like a good basis 

520.52 521.82 A: for 

521.92 524.56 A: attacking a whole another country 

524.69 528.86 A: or not even being able to work out your differences with them 

529.26 530.18 A: (( you know )) 

530.58 534.63 A: the saying live and let live it would seem to me would be 

534.69 539.08 A: that you could kind of say okay you are entitled to disagree with us 

540.69 545.36 A: just don't try to you know pawn your ways off on us 

545.43 551.78 B: well that's just like with the pledge of allegiance and the prayers in school and all this this is what's happening 

552.29 558.99 B: i mean this is our way of life we've always been that way but now it offends this religion it offends this 

559.59 561.08 B: and that you know 

561.23 562.92 B: and we can't do it any more 

563.67 565.82 B: and i disagree with that completely 

567.93 573.30 B: if i want to stand up and say the lord's prayer i think i have the right as a person 

573.53 575.10 B: not just an american 

575.38 577.09 B: to stand up and say it 

577.09 582.35 A: [mn] well the is their religion and they 

581.42 583.81 B: but they are imposing it on us 

584.26 590.65 A: yes they are and that's you know where i'm saying they shouldn't it should be you 

590.72 599.89 A: know the type of thing where they say hey this is what we believe that's what you believe but let's leave religion out of it this is more of two countries that should be able
