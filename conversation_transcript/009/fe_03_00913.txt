20.17 22.38 A: oh not very good there either 

21.70 23.99 B: not very good here either [mn] 

23.08 25.54 A: so do you watch reality t._v. 

25.22 28.42 B: no i do not i do not like it do you 

26.60 27.42 A: oh 

28.11 37.98 A: um some of 'em i like a lot i i love the bachelor and the bachelorette and i love watching american idol some of 'em i think are kind of stupid though 

37.84 46.04 B: well that that's me now i have watched american idol a couple of times and the bachelor maybe one time [mn] 

45.51 46.51 A: uh-huh 

46.25 54.52 B: but some of those others i [mn] i told somebody the other day i said seeing somebody eat bugs or crawl around in snakes is just not my idea of entertainment 

53.16 60.52 A: yeah that that's fear factor i didn't like that one either but i i did like joe millionaire did you ever watch that one 

60.40 72.66 B: [mn] no i didn't ah my daughter in laws did though and they liked it [mn] i just i don't know i've just never been able to get into anything like that now my little grandson likes the survivor show 

72.12 74.77 A: uh-huh that's a very popular one 

74.56 83.12 B: but i just i don't know i've just never gotten into it i it just for some reason doesn't appeal to me bt that's just about all that's on t._v. now 

82.55 93.69 A: i know and and there's one that was just coming on tonight that was called um [lipsmack] married by america or something where america actually picks the two to get married to one another 

90.21 90.83 B: (( um )) 

93.75 96.22 A: now i think that's going a little too far [laughter] 

95.78 102.84 B: [laughter] i do too now if if that's the best they can do to find a mate they're in trouble [laughter] i don't know what 

101.66 111.20 A: you know these reality shows are very very popular now um joe millionaire had more viewers watching it when it was first on than any other show 

111.93 113.44 A: which is amazing 

113.44 122.93 B: it really is because that like i say i wasn't that crazy about that type of show but evidently everybody else is because like you say they are very popular 

122.37 128.08 A: yeah yeah i wonder i wonder what actually you know draws everyone to 'em 

123.70 124.54 B: (( so )) 

128.62 136.38 B: [mn] i don't know ah that that's [mn] kind of um i guess of the amazement with me as to why they're popular because 

136.93 147.15 B: to me they don't appeal to me so what why is everyone else so you know involved with 'em i mean they just get really upset with 'em sometimes [noise] 

143.47 144.27 A: right 

146.20 158.73 A: i wonder if people just put themselves in that place and it's more like um a fantasy type thing you know where where they can actually fantasize and pretend that that's them in that that actual position or something 

159.35 163.34 B: hm well i've never thought about it that way now that may be it 

162.49 164.04 A: [laughter] 

163.43 165.65 B: (( now i like soap operas )) 

165.33 166.34 A: (( oh do you )) 

166.11 168.10 B: but but now to me 

167.66 171.20 A: now that's not reality t._v. at all [laughter] 

168.78 176.23 B: that's not reality t._v. and and and well but to me these reality shows are not really reality either 

176.61 178.17 A: no it's a good point 

177.07 182.05 B: i mean who would who would go on t._v. and have someone else pick a mate for 'em you know 

181.51 187.94 A: yeah i know they i think they must have to be desperate or else they're hoping to get a lot of money [laughter] out of it or something 

187.93 197.35 B: or or like you know when they like the bachelor the bachelorette you know you keep narrowing them down i wouldn't want to be under that much scrutiny i guess 

197.45 198.43 A: (( i know )) 

197.61 198.99 B: is what i'm saying 

198.64 207.71 A: i really i liked i specially liked watching the bachelorette i thought that one was pretty good and she actually picked the guy that i liked the best too 

206.96 214.27 B: oh really [laughter] but now i wonder if anything will come of it that that's the thing [noise] 

207.84 210.60 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

213.42 220.58 A: well they're already engaged so they they've shown 'em on some other shows like um entertainment tonight and extra and stuff and 

220.38 231.47 A: you know they've caught 'em like skiing in colorado and and they said they're just you know they're having a a little bit longer engagement so they can get to know each other better but they're definitely going to have a marriage so 

230.91 233.22 B: oh okay wow that [mn] 

231.87 238.32 A: that's like the first one of all of those that has a- actually worked out 'cause the two bachelor ones didn't they broke up [laughter] 

238.43 244.04 B: did they get anything money wise at the end of that like jo- joe millionaire did 

241.33 245.91 A: yeah they got a they got a million dollars to split between the two of 'em 

245.61 247.10 B: oh okay 

247.25 250.25 B: now that would be a big incentive [laughter] 

248.86 262.39 A: well i don't think they knew about it that was ah a like a total shock to both of them at the end and you could tell they were very surprised the producers gave 'em a million dollar check and it was to be split and they they had no clue that that was coming 

253.75 255.01 B: oh really 

262.29 264.71 B: oh okay well now that [mn] 

264.73 268.89 B: that would be a nice surpli- surprise wouldn't it [laughter] 

267.08 270.45 A: yeah [laughter] 

269.78 273.28 B: and then course if they got married they would have the whole thing 

272.94 287.78 A: yeah yeah now the one that the one reality show i really don't understand the rationale for is is the fear factor why people you know one person's going to win money in the ending and that but why people do get on there and do some of the ridiculous things they do 

273.57 275.58 B: [laughter] course [noise] [noise] 

287.63 290.79 A: and some of the things i think are actually dangerous 

290.65 296.14 B: [mn] well they look like it whether they really are o- or they're just made to look that way [mn] 

295.59 296.60 A: uh-huh 

296.87 303.09 B: ah i'm like you i i d- i can't understand why some women would get on the t._v. and do that 

302.55 309.75 A: i know i think i've watched that show two or three times and one time they actually had to jump off the back of a boat going forty miles an hour 

309.67 322.49 A: onto another boat that was going forty miles an hour and you know i mean they're jumping and they're like ten feet apart and a couple of them hit those and like flipped back into the water and i thought they could kill themselves you know if they hit wrong 

322.10 327.26 B: [noise] or end up being paralyzed for the rest of their life and would that be worth it [mn] 

323.86 325.34 A: yeah i think 

326.62 330.73 A: i know i could not believe that they actually had 'em do things like that 

330.46 334.08 B: i'm sure they had to sign all sorts of releases and all 

333.63 334.87 A: yeah 

334.26 342.36 B: you know to they wouldn't hold the network responsible and all of that but sometimes that type of agreements don't hold up in court so 

341.63 342.78 A: i know 

343.09 348.15 A: i know 'cause i know the one you could tell he was stunned when he fell back into the water but 

349.01 355.32 A: that show doesn't appeal to me and and survivor i've only watched it when it got to the very ending just to see who 

354.26 361.33 B: [noise] well now that's when i watched it i didn't didn't watch didn't watch the others but then my little grandson watched every one of 'em 

356.13 357.10 A: [laughter] 

360.61 365.78 A: yeah well it's like my sister-in-law she gets really into it she loves the survivor shows 

365.30 370.30 B: and there's one now something about [mn] celebrity something celebrity 

370.77 381.59 A: oh the celebri- where they have the celebrities out like doing stuff yeah i only saw like maybe ten minutes of that show but it's like that's all that's on t._v. now is reality shows 

370.97 371.75 B: (( um )) 

375.22 376.41 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

380.98 387.33 B: i know it if you if you don't watch that there's not a lot to watch i mean reruns or [sigh] 

384.93 386.00 A: i know 

386.87 390.22 A: right flip through the channels and that's all there is 

389.38 390.41 B: mhm 

390.27 399.07 A: i think all the networks are just trying to like get in on you know some of 'em become very popular so now they're all they're all trying it 

396.26 408.50 B: they're all getting in on it trying trying to trying to compete and and [mn] wha- what they don't know is everybody th- you know a lot of people are turning off of all three channels because of that or all the channels 

399.17 400.12 A: (( yup )) 

407.15 409.14 A: i know not even watching 

409.00 414.29 B: [laughter] well i know i'm definitely not let's put it that way [laughter] 

409.53 411.33 A: [laughter] 

414.22 424.12 A: i guess that i do some but it's i want to have a variety i don't want to just have to watch that you know i want to watch other things too so i think they're getting into it just a little too much 

421.23 421.91 B: (( right )) 

423.80 427.30 B: [mn] i do i think they're getting just a little too extreme with it [noise] too 

426.83 433.74 A: yeah well i think it's they have to have more and more things so people will watch it you know otherwise they're gonna get bored with it 

433.51 440.94 B: and i think they have to get just a little bit more extreme to outdo what they've just did or done 

438.68 439.73 A: right 

439.76 444.18 A: right to to get the audience to come back and watch more i know 

440.99 441.55 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

442.13 443.19 B: mhm 

443.21 455.27 B: ah to keep to keep 'em [mn] i- it's kinda like at at fights and things like that you know it seems almost like the crowd is bloodthirsty [laughter] you know the more dangerous it is the more they want [sigh] 

451.25 452.26 A: yeah [laughter] 

454.72 457.28 A: but people are like that i know they are 

456.70 460.86 B: mhm yeah really they are and and that's the sad part [laughter] 

459.40 462.66 A: i know it definitely definitely is 

461.97 463.58 B: [mn] but [mn] 

463.72 466.04 B: i don't know i just like you're saying ah 

466.13 470.77 B: that's all that's on t._v. so you either watch it or you turn it off [laughter] 

470.19 479.34 A: i know we just turned it off just before this phone call came through because they had that one um married by america i said i don't want to watch this this is stupid 

479.01 481.05 B: [laughter] 

479.40 485.12 A: you know america votes on like which guy or is gonna be engaged to this girl 

485.31 486.02 A: (( ugh )) 

485.39 487.74 B: and isn't there one where the parents 

487.65 489.38 A: oh yes 

488.23 500.05 B: are picking or or [mn] something about the parents of either the bachelor or the bachelorette one it's it's the bachelor i think is supposed to be picking who's who's their choice for him 

499.67 508.68 A: yup i've i've watched that a couple of times just 'cause there was nothing else on to watch and they actually even make 'em go through a um lie detector test 

508.45 511.40 B: oh you're kidding [laughter] 

509.43 514.67 A: no and then they ask 'em some like really ridiculous questions you know and 

514.05 518.41 B: how deep into their past does that lie detector go [laughter] 

517.37 528.57 A: well th- some of 'em had asked some very very personal questions about stuff you know and i think some of it doesn't even have anything to do with their life now if it's something that happened you know years ago 

529.07 537.96 A: but i don't know i know i [mn] the one on on that one they actually give the couple a trip to hawaii that's what they're going for 

537.59 539.96 B: oh that that's the big prize 

539.13 552.50 A: yup just so you can have a date in hawaii you know and they get i don't know how long just a week or how long it is but i have watched that a couple of times and it it's kinda cute to watch it's not something i'd i would like drop everything else for to watch [laughter] 

552.25 556.25 B: [mn] not something you'd make it a point to be in front of the t._v. set to watch 

554.33 561.21 A: right now joe millionaire i made a point and the bachelorette i had to watch that every week [laughter] i was there 

558.40 564.97 B: [laughter] i guess that's what they're hoping is that you'll pick one and get hooked on it 

564.26 574.67 A: yup it's 'cause once you do and i started talking to my daughter in california about it you know and she started watching and she got hooked on it too and she didn't like it in the beginning it's like you watch it 

572.83 576.19 B: (( oh well maybe i should have give it a chance then [laughter] )) 

574.91 582.53 A: well you watch it and you got to see what happens next you know it's sort of like your soap operas they just you know they leave you hanging [laughter] 

578.18 579.40 B: [laughter] 

581.64 586.64 B: and so you so you want to go back well i guess that's what it is i just didn't watch it long enough 

586.08 588.16 A: yup [laughter] 

587.11 599.89 B: [laughter] because i think i'd i don't think i watched any of the earlier ones i i kinda got in on the last few and that was mostly because on entertainment tonight they kept having joe millionaire on it talking about what's going 

597.60 599.86 A: constantly didn't they
