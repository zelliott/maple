3.81 4.98 A: hello 

5.08 6.29 A: this is shirley 

9.84 11.99 B: hi this is tammy 

12.94 15.03 B: (( you should introduce yourself after the )) 

15.04 15.73 B: (( tone )) 

15.50 16.67 A: after the tone 

16.40 17.36 B: (( did you hear the )) 

19.20 19.86 B: (( tone )) 

22.67 26.03 A: i think airport security yes i think it will 

37.25 39.07 B: i believe that airport 

39.34 41.28 B: security has 

42.30 45.01 B: decreased the likelihood of another attack 

45.99 47.47 B: (( what do you think about that )) 

49.99 52.17 A: [noise] i think so also 

55.46 58.98 B: how do you think that that's happened 

57.78 68.77 A: well i think anybody who might be thinking about it now would think twice because there is security everywhere you go and they check everything now and i think people 

69.45 72.25 A: think twice before they try to do it again 

73.05 78.55 B: i don't think that it's necessarily gonna stop something like that from happening again because 

78.94 88.70 B: they're gonna find a way to do it no matter what i think those terrorists are smart and like it or not they're gonna find a way to do what it is that they want to do 

89.33 94.21 A: whether it be in the airports at the bus terminals 

94.41 103.19 A: on the bridges like you know everybody is having us be aware of now they will try just about anything and rent cars rent motor homes 

104.93 106.83 B: yeah i agree with that too 

106.95 107.73 B: (( i )) 

107.87 112.05 B: don't know if the increased security has 

113.92 118.42 B: lessened there if anything it's motivated them to find even 

118.40 129.78 B: sneakier ways to get into the airport and get in undetected because basically that's what they do terrorists they operate like that so that's just the way that they're gonna do things 

130.31 131.58 B: what do you think 

132.77 134.09 A: yes that's 

134.72 139.53 A: easily what they do and lots of times i think that some of the terrorists 

139.71 145.72 A: like the ones that they had caught were already here and watching us listening to our news reports 

145.76 147.23 A: and plotting 

147.33 150.36 A: what they could do after listening to the reports 

150.48 151.93 A: around the country 

151.32 153.06 B: yeah i agree with that too 

153.20 154.28 B: (( because )) 

154.68 166.61 B: just like the last guy that they caught he went to a historically black university he actually got a degree from a school here so they're everywhere there's nothing that we gonna i don't think there's anything that we can really do to 

166.42 170.97 B: that's gonna curtail them we might slow 'em down a little bit but 

171.63 182.84 B: they're gonna do it whether it's in the air or on a train or a bus like they do in in europe they are always doing it on buses and i don't think it's gonna be long before we are gonna have 

183.32 190.23 B: suicide bombers walking around with bombs strapped to themselves like they do over there in israel so i mean just trying to 

190.51 194.48 B: narrow the slate narrow it down to the airport is just not really 

195.01 203.31 B: i don't think it's really a feasible thing because there are so many airports and then if they don't go to a major airport what happens if they go to a small private airport 

203.26 214.57 B: and they charter a plane and then they ram the plane into you know they ram that plane into another plane or something so it's just kind of crazy the way the 

214.89 216.76 B: that the world is right now 

220.68 235.21 A: you know it's kind of scary but what we have to do is put our hands in the you know into the hands of the lord and just go on living our lives daily and be aware as long as we are aware of all of this you know we won't be too shocked when things happen we just have to 

235.21 239.51 A: you know be on our guard all the time and go on with our lives 

240.55 248.77 B: and i don't i don't even know if the airport security is all that they are saying it's cracked up to be there because 

249.74 250.69 B: i mean 

252.47 259.04 B: they're going to find a way to get the stuff in there somebody is not going to do their job somebody is going to be slacking or 

259.08 265.35 B: you know there's going to be something that's going to slip by because after all it's just you know we are just human 

265.44 270.60 B: and they're gonna find some kind of way to masquerade and they're gonna find some way to hide the 

270.48 280.52 B: explosives and you know i just don't know there's so many people on the payroll that you don't know that haven't been identified i mean that's how 

280.86 285.70 B: terrorism works you know you have the people that you least suspect 

285.94 291.33 B: doing these things and then when it all comes out everybody's saying gosh that was my neighbor 

291.35 292.77 B: i can't believe 

292.78 296.99 B: i didn't know that but that's the whole idea behind it you don't know 

298.19 300.02 A: and these people are so 

300.03 301.13 A: smart 

301.21 303.33 A: so sneaky 

303.53 308.40 A: they look just like ordinary americans walking down the street every day 

308.77 309.81 A: and it's 

310.90 312.59 A: gonna be hard 

313.47 320.37 B: well i think the whole basis behind terrorism itself is based on terror 

320.52 322.18 B: (( and i )) 

322.35 324.61 B: mean i think the heightened 

324.63 331.29 B: airport security is just playing into their hands not saying that we should lessen its security but 

331.80 334.86 B: i don't know it should have been there all along 

335.41 347.78 B: just because of the world that we live in today and the increased security sure it makes your trip longer and it takes hours more hours to travel and it makes it almost not worth it to fly 

347.78 352.28 B: but you fly and you pay for that convenience because you don't want to drive 

352.21 358.64 B: or you don't want to catch a train so you want to get there the quickest way you can and that's just a part of 

358.50 367.33 B: using the airport i mean the security has to increase if if they want to have the conf- if they want the consumers to have the confidence 

367.32 369.09 B: in the airports 

369.03 370.90 B: that they will use them 

370.84 375.24 B: and you know the airports can continue to make money and then of course the 

375.15 387.84 B: country can continue to make money out of the airports making money out of the people that want to make the money to fly to fly to go and make more money so i mean it's just a vicious cycle but the increased security is just a part of that 

388.18 389.47 A: and maybe soon 

389.55 390.67 A: maybe if 

390.93 392.46 A: the united states were 

393.39 402.85 A: patting themselves after the way it is overseas in all the foreign countries they have that security in their airports and they have had it for years so maybe if we 

402.92 404.51 A: keep this up 

404.83 411.54 A: and structure our lives the way they do over there we might be able to you know 

411.85 415.02 A: crack a little bit of it slow it down a little bit i 

416.39 425.44 B: yeah but the bottom line is that the security is going to have to stay there and you know it's unfortunate that we have to 

425.69 429.92 B: go to such lengths to try to protect ourselves from 

429.97 431.77 B: a hidden danger 

431.76 443.11 B: but you know i say that it is a good thing that we have the security and it's an inconvenience but when you weigh it out is it really an inconvenience if it actually saves your life 

443.05 454.38 B: so i mean you know just like what happened with september eleventh and because they weren't on top of it you know there were measures in place then it just didn't happen 

454.63 456.96 B: so i mean we can't 

457.70 462.75 B: i don't know that the increased security is an overreaction 

462.78 466.16 B: but i mean is can it be an overreaction 

467.86 471.67 B: up to this point or what i really don't know 

474.63 476.56 B: so what else do you think 

476.73 478.39 A: don't think it really takes 

481.37 483.24 A: it doesn't take too much 

483.33 484.40 A: effort 

485.30 488.79 A: or money to keep the security in the airports 

489.28 494.00 A: the government is just going to have to get up off that money and pay for that security and 

494.35 496.80 A: we have to pay more taxes 

497.46 508.64 A: that's just the way it is now that's gonna be a part of our lives now that we have to pay that extra tax extra plane fares so that we can fly and feel comfortable flying taking our children 

508.77 510.49 A: in the air nowadays 

510.50 515.90 A: i don't believe anybody has i don't believe that there has been any less people flying than there were 

516.72 517.95 A: before 

518.22 520.38 A: the accident before nine eleven 

520.73 529.13 B: i don't know i think things kind of died off after nine eleven but i think they're starting to pick up because of the security being put in place 

529.40 536.61 B: however you know when you said that you know the government's not paying for it we're paying for it 

536.67 538.07 B: because 

538.27 549.08 B: and it's just something that you're going to have to pay for you're going to have to pay for that convenience once again flying is a convenience you know and for some people it's a luxury but you have to pay for those things 

549.39 558.71 B: you know and you know that's just part of it that's part of living in this country that we live in you have to pay if you want to play you've got to pay 

559.64 561.95 A: i love to travel and when i'm going 

562.40 569.17 A: like distances i prefer to fly than drive and i go and get on the plane now and just leave earlier 

569.40 573.72 A: and go and so far it's been okay 

574.23 576.55 B: yeah and hopefully it will stay that way 

576.70 585.07 B: but you know like i said it's just a necessary part of the travelling process if you're gonna fly it's just a necessary thing that you have to go through so 

585.69 587.28 B: you know what can you do 

587.72 599.89 B: except pay it either you pay it or you don't go and if you're trying to get where you have got to get and you want to get somewhere quickly that's what you're gonna have to do so that's just the way you know that's the way the ball bounces
