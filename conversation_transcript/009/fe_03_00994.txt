125.33 127.60 B: you know and it's uh 

127.83 130.71 B: i try not to think about it and try not to worry about it 

131.17 131.90 B: because 

132.18 133.92 B: there's not a whole lot you can do 

134.08 136.53 B: and if they use um

144.27 146.87 B: you know unless you got the um 

147.92 148.91 B: oh

151.02 151.64 B: the um 

152.03 154.80 B: in the syringe and you have to s- give it in your heart 

155.32 157.94 A: oh h- i know what you're talking about 

157.72 161.78 B: i can't think of the name of it at the moment though but you know what i mean 

160.00 164.06 A: i i know yep i know exactly what you're talking about and i can't think of the name of it 

162.04 163.65 B: and it's like 

165.15 167.92 B: because there's so many different 

168.71 172.91 B: biological agents there's no way that you could be prepared 

173.38 173.87 A: no 

173.80 175.19 B: for all of them you know 

174.57 184.33 A: none and there's so many places that i mean even just local stores around here are selling like the v- the (( vaseline )) and the 

181.61 183.00 B: the duck tape and plastic 

184.62 185.64 A: duck tape 

186.28 186.92 A: they have 

186.33 188.51 B: that ain't going to stop it from coming in

194.34 196.52 A: if it's going to happen it's going to happen i 

196.16 199.07 B: but you know there's different gas masks for different kinds of gases 

198.80 199.42 A: exactly 

199.62 200.77 B: and so you know 

200.92 202.25 A: and they have to be fitted 

201.09 211.18 B: that's why you going to have a case of fifty different kinds of gas masks okay which agent is it that it's going to kill me in ninety seconds which one do i put on you know it's all a gamble anyway 

209.13 209.87 A: exactly 

211.50 212.25 A: mhm 

212.61 214.95 A: and they have to be fitted properly for your face

215.72 216.31 A: for one 

216.92 218.73 A: you get one it's not going to be (( fitting ))

279.09 281.50 A: and i want him to be hear at home 

282.07 282.92 B: so what you going to do jus- 

283.01 285.64 B: stay home and not have a life anymore and just 

285.39 286.19 A: oh 

285.81 289.86 B: stay you know locked up in your house or in a bunker or so- you know

291.45 295.40 A: i thought about it and it's like no can't be scared can't do that 

296.19 301.90 B: and even if you do have fear you have to not show it so he's not scared 

296.21 296.64 A: but there's 

301.75 302.69 A: exactly 

303.19 303.75 A: and that's 

303.84 305.41 A: that's a hard thing to do 

306.00 306.76 A: but he um

381.32 381.99 A: it's a mess 

383.46 384.68 A: just a mess 

385.31 388.20 A: no tony blair he's bam right up in there 

388.14 390.51 B: oh yeah he was from the very beginning 

389.23 392.70 A: he was yeah exactly way back even in what ninety one 

392.78 393.28 B: mhm 

393.49 396.14 A: desert storm (( )) let's go let's go move it 

395.82 396.78 B: let's go help them 

397.55 399.30 B: but you know if we're 

400.81 404.73 B: oh i lost my train of thought i was getting ready to say something and it went (( )) 

405.42 406.75 B: but um 

408.92 411.18 B: you know as far as russia and germany 

411.58 412.27 A: mhm 

411.71 413.16 B: i could care less 

413.74 415.67 B: whether we have their approval or not 

415.75 416.32 A: eg- e- 

416.44 417.33 A: exactly 

417.32 418.15 B: you know 

418.23 422.48 A: exactly you know it's going to it's going to go either way 

423.50 426.08 A: you know i got a feeling approval or not 

426.77 428.03 A: it's it's going to go 

428.27 429.19 A: bush is 

429.48 431.42 A: dead set and determined 

431.51 433.67 B: but the the thing that i'm torn about 

433.77 434.96 B: is 

438.47 440.63 B: you know saddam is never going to get rid of his stuff 

440.76 442.44 B: he's never going to get rid of it 

440.88 441.59 A: um no 

441.98 442.51 A: no 

442.58 445.29 B: but what i'm torn about is if 

446.04 446.73 B: bush 

447.62 455.52 B: is doing this because he really feels like this is what needs to be done or if he's doing this as a vendetta for his daddy 

455.87 461.52 A: see now that's what my husband says and i i i'm kind of leaning to that too 

461.65 462.23 A: um 

462.59 464.86 A: you said it's it's it's just 

465.00 467.32 A: something he's doing because of his father 

468.25 469.17 A: it's uh 

469.82 475.56 A: what his father was here in ninety one and it started it never got finished 

473.32 474.76 B: well like twelve years ago 

475.45 475.87 B: right 

475.97 477.26 A: so he's going to finish it 

476.10 478.67 B: they should have took his ass out to begin with 

478.26 479.99 A: they they really should have 

480.36 483.26 A: you know and th- there was so many times that they could have 

483.65 484.41 A: and they didn't 

485.61 488.27 B: but if they're not going to take care of him this time 

489.10 490.82 B: then we don't need to be going over there 

491.16 491.96 A: exactly 

492.84 494.96 B: you know you don't do a half assed job 

492.89 493.28 A: because that's 

495.26 499.19 A: yes it's what they did the first time half assed job and 

495.35 496.18 B: you do it 

499.29 502.09 A: you know who is to say his daddy didn't 

502.58 503.53 A: didn't leave it 

504.04 504.88 A: you know 

505.36 505.75 A: just 

506.06 508.45 A: nearly missing him the first time 

509.07 510.05 A: i don't know 

510.25 512.34 A: you you just don't know anymore 

513.91 517.60 A: and this whole you know the whole (( thing )) i believe is like you 

517.94 518.65 A: it's a vendetta 

520.46 521.41 B: unless um
