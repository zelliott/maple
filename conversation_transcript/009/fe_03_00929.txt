0.96 1.42 A: hello 

1.56 2.29 B: hi 

2.34 2.81 A: hi 

3.05 5.37 B: my name is florence and i'm in florida 

5.21 8.35 A: okay my name's barbara and i'm in philadelphia pennsylvania 

8.47 9.77 B: hm i'm 

10.27 13.20 B: familiar with that was born and raised in wilmington delaware 

13.09 13.60 A: okay 

14.09 14.52 A: okay 

14.98 16.52 A: now our our question 

17.29 18.03 B: um 

17.56 21.03 A: what what should the the united states do about iraq 

20.77 22.42 B: right um 

22.03 24.23 A: that's an interesting one what do you think about that 

26.71 29.01 B: i actually think that uh 

30.99 33.12 B: disarming is not really 

34.00 37.87 B: uh going to be effective because we cannot believe what he says 

38.44 38.91 A: yeah 

39.49 40.09 A: well 

40.67 41.20 A: uh i've 

41.36 41.81 A: i gue- 

42.06 44.77 A: the question that keeps coming to my mind is that is it 

45.30 46.99 A: the responsibility of the united 

47.09 48.11 A: states to be the 

48.35 49.28 A: the world's police 

49.37 49.68 A: force 

50.96 52.57 A: and i don't know i mean 

53.02 57.19 A: in one way it it he scares me because he reminds me of hitler 

58.10 61.47 A: but in other ways i think you know we're getting ourselves into something that 

61.86 63.34 A: maybe it's not really our business 

64.48 64.94 A: so i'm 

65.34 67.96 B: but why isn't it our business when uh 

68.28 71.52 B: he he could perpetrate things just like nine one one 

71.76 74.92 A: well yeah that's what i think too i mean is he going to give these weapons 

75.04 76.77 A: to the terrorists i mean if he 

75.55 76.96 B: well i think uh 

77.35 80.61 B: you know i and i think he is disarming i mean he's 

80.96 83.95 B: destroying but he's also 

82.04 82.53 A: mhm 

84.53 87.53 B: in public he is but in private and in secret he's 

85.99 86.30 A: yeah 

87.91 88.48 B: uh 

88.68 89.54 B: building more 

90.45 90.86 A: yeah 

90.92 92.69 B: so you know i don't 

93.17 95.89 B: i don't think i really know the answer for sure 

95.75 96.13 A: yeah 

96.00 96.95 B: but 

96.33 104.06 A: i have mixed feelings i have uh a sixteen year old son and i guess it kind of scares me if you know if they reinstitute the draft and 

101.93 102.77 B: yeah 

104.20 104.82 A: you know i 

105.19 109.04 A: came of age during the vietnam war era and the first 

109.34 110.76 A: i was a senior in high school 

111.20 113.41 A: the year that they had the lottery system 

114.21 115.86 A: and one of my close friends was 

116.03 117.25 A: had a very low number 

117.67 119.95 A: and then the war ended you know but uh 

120.60 121.08 A: so that 

120.70 125.68 B: real- see i i'm older than that i come from the era that my father was in world war two 

125.57 126.03 A: mhm 

126.08 127.77 B: and um 

128.94 130.52 B: it's not a pleasant thought 

130.37 130.96 A: no 

130.68 132.00 B: it was awful 

132.11 132.97 B: but 

133.08 135.07 B: i'm not sure it isn't necessary 

135.37 138.52 B: i i really don't have an absolute a hundred percent 

138.67 139.05 A: yeah 

139.74 140.67 B: uh answer 

140.87 141.24 A: yeah 

141.41 141.93 A: i i 

142.04 142.88 A: i think i feel 

143.10 144.83 A: sort of the same way you know i'm not 

145.04 146.17 A: positive that 

147.01 150.73 A: one way or the other but i i really don't want to see us involved in a war 

151.55 152.40 A: i i 

152.77 154.77 A: found that the persian gulf war was 

154.90 156.00 A: i found that kind of 

156.11 156.58 A: scary 

157.70 158.47 A: but um 

158.65 159.49 A: i remember 

158.80 159.30 B: well 

159.82 166.41 B: i have a son in law who was in that and came home never well and eventually died at forty four 

162.07 162.63 A: mhm 

166.15 166.99 A: oh wow 

167.56 167.94 A: (( gosh )) 

167.61 170.92 B: so um you know i have a lot of mixed feelings 

170.57 171.16 A: yeah 

171.68 172.76 B: and 

173.15 174.66 B: i i don't know the answer to it 

174.69 175.06 A: yeah 

175.56 176.16 A: but that's what 

175.77 178.95 B: too bad we didn't have a simple question like food 

178.16 182.26 A: yeah or or yesterday was reality t._v. shows you know 

182.57 183.86 A: a lighter topic 

186.42 187.33 A: no me neither 

188.49 189.20 A: yeah 

188.62 195.03 B: now what is the procedure af- we after i've never done this before so what is the procedure after we state our opinion 

195.27 200.27 A: i think that we we talk for ten minutes and they all of a sudden after ten minutes they just cut us off 

200.43 203.47 B: okay uh and um what do they do with our conversation 

203.69 204.52 A: um 

205.31 207.16 A: i'm not really sure what they're doing with it 

207.45 208.08 A: i i 

208.24 209.63 A: heard a couple different things 

210.24 211.77 A: i guess they would tell us if we asked 

212.00 212.36 A: so 

213.03 214.62 A: i'm not really positive 

215.80 216.12 A: so 

216.60 219.82 A: i don't i don't know whether they're studying language or they're they're 

219.99 221.73 A: you know what they're just what they're doing 

221.92 222.50 A: i don't know 

223.18 223.43 A: so 

223.78 225.10 A: what area of florida are you in 

225.40 225.91 B: um 

226.31 227.45 B: palm coast 

227.46 227.88 A: okay 

228.04 229.05 B: do you know where that is 

228.96 229.84 A: no 

229.44 233.48 B: i'm i'm midway between saint augustine and daytona beach on the oc- 

233.05 234.05 A: oh okay okay 

234.38 236.82 A: yeah i just talked to my sister in law and she's in auburndale

242.88 245.79 B: oh it it's hot today but you know it hasn't been uh 

243.56 243.85 A: so 

246.11 247.13 B: terrific winter 

247.60 253.35 B: i mean it i'm sure it has compared to yours but i mean for for us it hasn't been a real good winter 

249.95 250.33 A: yeah 

253.75 256.98 B: but uh i've only been here six six years 

254.14 254.93 A: (( )) 

256.76 257.24 A: okay 

257.68 260.58 A: yeah i was the thing i was going to say i've just found this whole thing 

261.07 264.27 A: i i have i feel like i have this anxiety level all the time 

265.05 265.98 A: you know that's much 

266.13 269.67 A: higher than than i normally would and this talk of war has really been 

270.29 271.27 A: frightening to me 

271.02 273.31 B: well if you did you watch oprah today 

273.07 274.26 A: no no i work 

274.44 275.54 A: full time so i 

274.44 282.11 B: she had she had um well i had just come home from work she had dan rather on and his interview with saddam hussein 

280.04 280.49 A: okay 

282.17 282.71 A: okay 

283.21 284.03 B: and uh 

284.97 288.38 B: he's sort of scary 

287.06 287.43 A: yeah 

288.49 289.84 A: did he have two interpreters 

290.02 291.38 A: that was what i heard yeah 

290.51 291.25 B: yes 

291.41 295.07 B: well you didn't get to see them but dan rather was you know 

293.51 294.03 A: okay 

295.21 299.48 B: talking but you did see a little bit of him as rather was 

299.69 300.19 B: uh 

300.35 308.22 B: asking him questions and then he said that he went after the interview was over he though he was done but saddam hussein uh 

301.55 301.90 A: uh huh 

308.97 313.06 B: (( took his own emotions )) he wanted c- into his private office and he had another 

313.33 314.13 B: off the 

314.76 315.45 B: camera 

315.81 318.62 B: uh conversation with him for an hour and fifteen minutes 

318.46 318.99 A: wow 

319.10 319.60 A: okay 

320.64 321.41 B: but i don't 

321.89 323.95 B: i don't trust this guy at all so 

323.62 323.92 A: yeah 

324.81 325.16 A: well 

325.32 327.03 A: you know the stories i've heard he's 

327.24 327.52 A: he's 

328.71 329.62 A: pretty brutal 

330.00 330.74 B: he is 

330.79 331.85 A: and you know (( this )) 

332.60 333.38 A: it's frightening 

333.91 335.56 A: the whole terrorist situation is 

336.41 336.94 A: frightening 

338.16 338.58 A: so 

339.12 339.94 A: i don't really 

339.60 341.08 B: that's why i'm not sure we 

341.21 342.74 B: we can just um 

342.51 343.22 A: ignore it 

343.06 347.24 B: ignore it and and hope it goes away cause i don't think it going to go away 

343.78 344.40 A: mhm 

347.31 347.82 A: yeah 

348.48 351.71 B: unless we get rid of some of these people i don't think it's going to go away 

351.58 352.10 A: yeah 

351.83 353.96 B: now i actually don't think that he 

354.48 356.27 B: represents the average 

356.64 357.26 B: person 

357.89 358.47 B: there 

357.92 359.24 A: i- in iraq yeah 

358.62 359.31 B: y- yeah 

359.52 359.91 A: yeah 

359.76 360.27 B: um 

361.63 365.42 A: i've read that that he he does not but of course they're afraid to say anything 

365.29 366.70 B: oh of course 

366.26 367.10 A: you know because you 

366.88 368.87 B: they've got to agree with whatever he says 

368.65 369.27 A: yeah 

368.99 370.65 B: well if they value their life they ha- 

370.24 370.61 A: right 

370.78 371.87 B: they do 

370.90 371.17 A: right 

372.12 372.58 B: um 

372.79 373.13 A: so 

373.40 373.95 A: there's not 

374.31 376.99 A: much uh dissension i guess in that country 

377.56 380.01 B: but i i sort of go if i 

381.27 386.57 B: if i had to give an answer (( tonight )) i'd probably say i sort of go along with bush that we have to do something 

386.63 387.11 A: yeah 

388.29 389.48 B: but it is scary 

389.54 389.94 A: yeah 

389.73 391.77 B: and having uh you know my father 

392.23 394.97 B: i remember how as a kid i was so scared 

395.32 397.07 B: you know all the time it's not fun 

397.05 397.43 A: yeah 

398.57 404.81 A: well i i- the the thing that it reminds me of you know it scared me when when they started talking about the duct tape and 

405.33 411.01 A: you know i said well what in the world are we supposed to do with that because i do remember as a child the whole fall out shelter thing 

413.05 416.57 A: you know that that we were supposed to have someplace to go and this was 

416.67 417.09 A: you know 

417.88 419.54 A: remember the signs 

421.83 422.42 A: mhm 

423.59 427.28 B: uh curtains on the windows that were pulled down that would uh that were black 

427.58 428.03 A: okay 

428.36 434.62 B: and so i re- i remember all that i remember the long lines uh with your ration stamps to get any food 

434.80 435.26 A: yeah that 

435.39 435.75 A: that's 

436.35 437.95 A: frightening i think you know 

437.81 445.72 B: but i see i've lived through that so and although i was only a kid i i def- i certainly remember it very clearly 

439.80 440.25 A: yeah 

445.63 446.00 A: yeah 

446.42 449.93 A: i know i remember very clearly i remember a few um 

451.07 452.77 A: you know warning sirens 

453.34 463.38 A: that everybody was supposed to go and get in their house we didn't have like the black out curtains or anything like that but i remember everybody knew the location of the nearest fall out shelter where where you were supposed to go and 

457.13 457.62 B: yeah 

461.93 462.35 B: yeah 

463.54 464.33 A: generally they were s- 

464.45 465.25 A: schools and 

465.36 466.96 A: there were signs up everywhere 

467.64 468.45 A: you know in all 

468.58 469.76 A: different places and i 

469.61 470.05 B: (( )) 

469.90 470.28 A: you know 

471.46 472.32 A: i i kind of was 

472.48 476.47 A: was hoping that my kids would never have to deal with something like that you know 

477.30 477.57 A: but 

477.81 484.43 B: well i think every generation does so i think when you think we should i think it's probably just wishful thinking 

480.64 481.16 A: yeah 

484.53 486.92 B: it seems like ener- every generation does 

484.60 485.03 A: yeah 

486.97 487.51 A: yeah 

487.88 488.27 A: yeah 

488.91 493.30 B: but uh i never had a son so you know i can't say i know what you feel 

489.18 489.43 A: (( oh )) 

493.06 493.50 A: yeah 

493.42 496.44 B: uh as i said it was my father and my son in law 

496.99 500.78 B: and my father was never well after he came back from the south pacific 

497.12 497.78 A: yeah well 

500.92 503.35 A: yeah my father was in the south pacific also 

503.46 503.89 B: yeah 

504.13 505.05 A: an he um 

505.78 510.22 A: he more or less obsessed with it you know i remember he was always reading war books and 

510.55 512.22 A: watching war movies and 

513.14 513.54 A: you know 

513.57 514.60 B: was he in the navy 

513.65 514.01 A: so 

514.71 515.57 A: he was in the marines 

515.70 516.11 B: hm 

516.47 519.23 A: yeah so i i don't know i don't know why that you know 

520.62 520.90 A: but 

521.91 527.14 A: so i i don't know i just wonder you know are we are we trying to push our culture onto another 

527.42 530.75 B: i don't really think we are i think we're just trying to 

531.66 532.28 B: um 

534.17 535.89 B: get him out of commission 

535.86 536.36 A: mhm 

536.31 536.94 B: because 

538.17 542.94 B: i mean when they had the camera on him his eyes there's something about his eyes 

544.80 546.86 B: and it's scary 

546.16 548.34 A: yeah he's uh a frightening character 

548.20 550.93 B: yeah and uh so i i would sort of 

551.43 557.03 B: if i had to vote tonight i'd probably say i would go along with bush if he felt that we had to do it then
