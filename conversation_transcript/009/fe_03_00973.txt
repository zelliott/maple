50.16 52.88 B: well that's news to me i hadn't heard that aspect of it 

52.97 59.08 B: but i do believe that they would've gotten around that and maybe just punctured the uh uh 

53.07 54.27 A: the oh abso- 

59.82 63.04 B: the airplane itself with bullets and then that would've uh 

63.31 63.79 B: altered 

68.26 68.76 B: right 

70.21 70.89 B: right 

71.15 83.04 A: and now in the (( )) situation um they had a bomb that was um uh hidden in in luggage and the thing was set you know was set to explode at a certain alt- 

79.30 79.83 B: right 

83.95 84.50 B: right 

90.75 97.42 A: they're they're talking about starting to do it all but if you had a bomb you could check it and not even get on the airplane 

97.53 98.22 B: well 

98.06 105.91 A: and boom and they weren't they d- they don't check uh they don't check uh check luggage they don't check cargo 

98.72 100.27 B: right right 

105.63 108.94 B: well they do have random checks of luggage here in atlanta 

109.47 118.61 A: oh oh yeah but it but it's the thing where it is designed to inconvenience uh individuals the flyers and it doesn't do a 

118.74 123.34 A: bit of good except slow everything down and make everybody paranoid 

123.58 131.68 A: uh i i think it i think it's just poorly conceived poorly executed doesn't really um doesn't really accomplish anything 

131.97 135.86 B: well well you are right about making uh travelers paranoid 

141.31 142.48 A: uh yeah exactly 

143.04 147.41 B: but i don't know what else they could do they they have to start somewhere and 

143.15 143.60 A: mhm 

147.94 149.76 B: and this was as good a start as any 

150.82 153.79 B: as far as uh airport security uh 

154.45 157.69 B: i think that maybe even uh x. ray at the door 

158.10 160.53 B: could help anything anything could help 

161.14 165.41 B: it wouldn't be a hindrance i mean eh inconvenience is better than um 

165.63 166.22 B: death 

167.38 175.90 A: well i can't i can't argue with that but you know there could be a secret motive and the secret motive is simply to get 

176.13 178.93 A: the public used to being searched 

178.46 179.06 B: right 

179.20 189.48 A: that you have no privacy that we can go through your stuff anytime that we feel like it uh that we can subject you to that you that simply 

184.38 185.05 B: right 

189.59 195.12 A: by by nature of the fact that you are a passenger you are a suspect 

192.89 193.45 B: right 

194.63 195.96 B: right that's right 

196.20 197.90 A: and um 

197.04 197.75 B: i agree 

198.36 208.98 A: i mean what kind of uh what kind of what kind of think is that and and what what it is it's that whole thing of a totalitarian state 

203.16 203.92 B: well 

208.50 209.03 B: yeah 

209.29 215.68 A: that we're going we're going to snoop into into all your personal affairs we're going to go through your stuff you are under suspicion 

215.59 222.71 B: well the stuff that they're coming up with now even in the random searches uh guns and drugs from uh 

222.96 223.61 B: uh 

224.27 226.05 B: i i wouldn't say high highly 

226.55 234.15 B: recommended or highly acclaimed senators but minor senators minor committee men are coming in from the islands with drugs 

233.89 239.75 A: but he but he can so what how many of them had the intention of high jacking an airplane 

238.52 239.00 B: none 

239.21 240.50 B: none 

239.97 240.75 A: none of them 

240.86 246.87 A: and i mean if you you know if you get you know how are you going to get if you've got a gun how how are you going to get it from 

247.91 250.57 A: you know from one point to another if you can't take it with you 

248.80 253.14 B: and these people aren't intending to shoot anybody on board that they're catching 

253.40 254.45 A: yeah there's (( near the )) 

253.40 254.84 B: (( )) 

254.56 259.16 A: exactly there's no intention you know it's not that they're apprehending uh people that 

259.43 267.73 A: that have evil intentions that they're going to high jack the airplane uh they're just simply inconveniencing citizens and i think you have the right listen you got a bag of drugs 

267.83 273.41 A: uh it's should be none of their business you know get on the airplane and take it wherever you want to and do whatever you want to with it 

272.30 277.37 B: oh no well we're going off the mark here we're going for airport security 

277.44 281.12 A: yeah but it doesn't i i really don't think that i really don't think that it 

281.23 283.82 A: uh actually contributes to 

284.29 292.37 A: uh security all it's doing is inconveniencing uh um the citizens uh and and it's so 

287.97 288.56 B: passengers 

288.90 290.50 B: right well 

292.93 297.32 A: (( )) it's so expensive and it's so wasteful and it creates this attitude 

295.86 298.63 B: it is it is but it does create jobs for 

298.76 302.07 B: uh securities which is good because um 

299.43 302.07 A: oh yes 

302.48 305.08 B: technology has displaced so many people 

304.65 305.26 A: uh-huh 

305.97 308.64 A: whe- where are you at i'm here in atlanta 

308.08 309.48 B: i'm in atlanta too 

309.56 310.53 A: oh okay 

309.74 316.06 B: and technology has displaced a lot of people and these are the people that can do these security jobs 

316.13 316.76 A: mhm 

316.29 323.22 B: so that would be one good aspect of it and if they weren't so gung ho where they're hurting people it would be 

324.78 325.92 B: in a sense that 

325.14 328.07 A: well it's um 

326.40 334.18 B: i- it's aggravating it's aggravating no doubt and i like i don't travel much uh not by airplane i go by car 

334.91 336.64 B: uh some also but 

337.39 342.81 A: well it'll it'll be the next step that uh if people get used to 

351.65 352.13 B: yeah 

352.01 359.88 A: and go through the car because we don't we don't like the way you look we don't like the kind of car you're driving and they're already doing that 

353.26 354.14 B: oh lord 

355.47 355.99 B: right 

357.65 358.06 B: right 

358.66 360.44 B: yeah racial profiling 

360.54 366.97 A: uh eh j- not just racial profiling but any kind of profiling for whatever reason if we don't like the way you look 

366.64 367.18 B: right 

369.20 371.47 B: well the out of state license plates are (( )) 

370.95 372.83 A: out of state license plates 

371.62 373.50 B: or yeah the uh good (( )) 

373.82 375.47 A: we can we can pull you over 

375.66 380.81 A: and even though we don't have any reason to believe we just we know you're up to something we don't like 

380.96 389.21 A: we don't like the looks of you and we're going to pull you over and we're going to find out what you're up to and so 

382.24 382.85 B: right 

385.63 386.13 B: right 

386.22 387.55 B: that's true that's true 

387.77 389.65 B: but that nine eleven was just so 

389.84 393.32 B: totally devastating to the morale of the country that 

393.79 396.44 B: we're kind of responding late we left the gate open 

396.95 398.97 B: and we're responding late with some 

399.80 402.28 B: stop getting ma- stop getting measures to try to 

402.66 407.23 B: avoid that again i don't know if we're going to be able to because they're coming up with some other things 

408.15 408.67 B: to uh 

408.99 411.04 B: counter balance what they did before but 

415.48 416.24 B: right 

430.85 439.85 B: i don't think so because uh uh you know at that time i had been traveling prior to that and it was such a shangri la experience you know we were almost toasting the pilots 

440.15 440.70 A: mhm 

440.36 443.98 B: you know on upon landing and applauding 

442.32 444.51 A: oh yeah 

444.25 446.78 B: and it was just like you know it was just like a 

446.95 451.17 B: a cavalier like you say shangri la i say experience 

451.44 451.96 A: mhm 

451.65 452.82 B: and uh 

453.10 455.71 B: under those conditions we weren't even looking for 

456.18 460.49 B: uh terrorists or anybody else that might do us harm we were just having fun 

460.99 467.87 A: well i think they're i think they're the high jacking of the airplanes and crashing into the world trade center and into the pentagon and 

468.18 469.02 A: the other one (( )) 

470.41 471.23 B: yeah in uh 

471.35 472.75 B: p- up state pennsylvania yeah 

476.81 477.13 B: uh 

478.92 480.24 B: highly orchestrated 

492.33 497.01 A: that will catch us unprepared so that it we will be flat footed once again 

496.80 497.65 B: but i don't but 

497.82 501.50 B: but it (( )) if they got us that way one time i think they can do it again 

501.69 503.73 B: that was so unbelievable 

501.76 502.60 A: um 

503.89 508.13 A: uh yeah we- i mean it was uh yes it was 

506.20 511.27 B: especially the pentagon it it blew away all our illusions about the pentagon 

511.62 513.12 B: having twenty one uh 

513.61 514.15 B: uh 

515.19 518.80 B: well that's a random number twenty one degrees of uh 

518.93 522.52 B: defense you know radar and every it just blew every illusion 

520.60 521.18 A: mhm 

522.62 525.33 B: about our secure national security 

523.05 523.53 A: mhm 

526.60 535.22 A: well the the indication was remember a a couple of years ago i think when clinton was still in office that that guy landed a small airplane on the lawn of the white house 

534.49 535.03 B: yeah 

538.98 539.75 B: eh yeah 

541.52 541.97 B: yeah 

545.28 547.82 A: there eh when it comes down like there is no security 

548.03 556.10 A: uh if somebody is absolutely determined to do something i don't think there's much of anything that you can do to stop them 

548.30 548.97 B: right 

550.59 551.16 B: right 

555.85 557.31 B: you you might be right about that 

557.57 563.85 A: and other than other than creating a climate and an atmosphere 

557.81 558.17 B: because 

564.02 565.16 A: where 

565.53 566.31 A: um
