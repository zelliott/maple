30.25 32.45 A: yeah we have the same problem here 

32.57 37.04 B: um i guess we're supposed to talk about what's acceptable and what is not acceptable 

36.92 38.55 A: yeah 

38.13 48.93 B: well for me um unacceptable is anything that i wouldn't repeat or am embarrassed hearing in front of ah the opposite sex how about you 

49.17 53.84 A: i would certainly agree with that i think that um [lipsmack] 

55.31 57.60 A: most things that can 

57.79 58.74 A: um 

60.26 61.38 A: be 

61.91 64.92 A: offensive i know that can be broad but um 

64.98 69.93 A: offensive to certain races or ethnicities or certain 

70.05 71.60 A: stereotypes of 

71.70 72.71 A: people 

72.92 75.06 A: is certainly unacceptable 

75.62 76.76 A: also 

76.79 85.03 B: i agree do you think that that comedians need to use off color humor in order to be funny i don't 

84.43 88.54 A: i don't think that they need to but i think that they think that they need to [laughter] 

87.90 89.93 B: yeah i agree with you on that one 

90.51 91.09 A: (( [cough] )) 

90.79 91.75 B: (( absolutely )) 

91.83 92.71 A: um 

93.18 94.76 A: i think that um 

95.91 100.18 A: often times people look for shock value um 

100.27 104.50 A: in order to be humorous when i don't think that's necessary at all 

104.15 105.05 B: no 

105.50 113.07 B: for me personally i there are very few things or people that can make me laugh out loud 

113.42 114.26 B: (( ah )) 

114.33 122.93 B: i do a lot of my laughing just very quietly i'll smile i might think something's funny but i think very little that comedians do 

123.13 123.92 B: (( um )) 

124.07 125.90 B: or that movies think 

126.05 130.06 B: are funny or t._v. shows think are funny move me in any way 

130.61 139.93 B: very rarely very rarely i i don't know if i'm a stick in the mud or if i just have a very different kind of sense of humor what about you 

140.14 141.13 A: um 

141.75 146.44 A: there are things that that um do make me laugh out loud i'm not a 

147.56 149.48 A: um really out 

149.61 156.94 A: outgoing person so um i do do a lot of laughter inside but i do laugh out loud and i think that um 

160.14 163.44 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] i don't know i just lost it um 

165.36 170.80 A: i think that i do um too like a dry sense of humor um 

170.20 171.04 B: uh-huh 

170.88 175.22 A: i i do find that very funny um 

174.45 178.03 B: yep i can appreciate that more than than slapstick 

176.45 180.12 A: yeah [laughter] yeah um 

180.80 187.19 A: yeah the people that i ah i have worked with several people that have ah very dry senses of humor and um 

187.60 190.25 A: they tend to be the funniest to me um 

190.49 192.63 A: of most of the people that i encounter 

192.40 198.75 B: oh yeah i w- i would agree with you i don't know very many but the few that i do yes i agree with you completely 

198.06 198.96 A: [laughter] 

198.95 207.45 B: absolutely one thing i resent in ah like t._v. shows or laugh tracks i really really it angers me that someone 

207.78 209.76 B: thinks i'm so stupid 

210.19 214.84 B: that they need to run a laugh track in order to encourage my laughter 

214.44 215.93 A: [laughter] 

215.32 217.37 B: all it does is anger me 

217.50 221.74 A: is that that's something i haven't thought of but um 

218.13 218.83 B: i 

222.10 225.25 A: i will probably pay more attention to that now that you've mentioned it 

224.94 227.61 B: oh it's incredibly annoying to me 

225.66 228.26 A: (( [laughter] )) 

228.33 235.14 B: and most of the things that they run the laugh track with i would never even smile at they're just plain stupid 

235.14 236.54 A: yeah 

235.93 241.44 B: i i think that there's a lot of comedy that's not only off color but just really stupid 

242.03 244.16 B: i don't have much tolerance of that 

245.81 247.65 A: yeah i think that um 

248.39 251.84 A: comedy has certainly seemed to have taken that route 

251.51 258.26 B: yeah did you ever used to like er bill cosby as a comedian as a stand up comedian 

258.78 264.82 A: um i did i haven't seen a whole lot of him but i have seen some things that i did like 

264.66 266.91 B: he was funny he made me laugh out loud 

266.53 268.50 A: yeah 

267.65 273.51 B: george carlen on the other hand is uses a lot of bad words i don't think that 

273.82 278.23 B: i mean some of the stuff he says is funny but i think he could tone it down some 

277.81 283.10 A: i i certainly do too i cannot listen to him when he is on a 

283.31 291.57 A: on a rant um with a lot of vulgar words [laughter] i i cannot um tolerate that 

290.30 304.17 B: one thing i find incredibly offensive is when i'm channel surfing and i go by some of the stations a lot of the black comedians are really not just off color they're down and out raunchy 

304.45 308.26 B: i mean they're really nasty i have no idea who these people are 

308.55 309.97 B: but um 

310.13 314.04 B: they're they're dressed in strange ways and 

314.32 316.32 B: their language is appalling 

316.62 326.17 B: and i find i don't spend any time there but as i'm cruising by i might listen to you know fifteen or twenty seconds of it i've never heard anything funny yet 

326.39 331.75 A: yeah um i don't do a lot of t._v. watching anymore um 

332.40 336.47 A: so i i but the shows that i do catch um 

338.46 344.70 A: er some have i don't know some of them i think are better than others as far as 

344.85 345.80 A: um 

345.86 347.37 A: humor but ah 

347.89 349.84 A: i have noticed um 

350.39 356.28 A: certainly that humor has gone the way more of the offensive um 

355.14 355.91 B: (( well i )) 

357.20 360.40 A: and vulgar that i don't care to hear at all 

360.14 362.06 B: no i don't care to hear it either 

361.98 367.96 B: i i if there's nothing funny about it once in a while once in a while not very often 

367.82 378.98 B: there might be a little cute joke that comes across the internet that's a little on the risque side but it's not dirty it's it's kinda it's cute that i don't mind so much 

378.94 385.19 B: but even there i'm a little bit put off but i think it's the least of all the of the er evils 

385.28 386.49 B: that are out there 

387.59 395.47 A: yeah i think with um when you're talking about things in in print um you can kinda at times put your own 

387.59 388.36 B: people 

396.01 398.53 A: um spin or your own 

399.50 405.88 A: [lipsmack] i'm not oh i'm not sure exactly what i'm trying to say but um you know you're putting your own um 

406.99 411.30 A: like influxes in certain sentences and things that um 

409.77 410.59 B: sure 

412.13 417.26 A: that can help the way that you interpret it so i do think that that is um 

419.46 420.66 A: gonna be 

420.75 423.89 A: less offensive than if you hear somebody 

422.02 422.77 B: (( yes )) 

424.47 426.69 A: speaking it in a tone that perhaps 

426.88 428.52 A: you wouldn't have considered 

428.08 429.26 B: exactly 

428.80 430.04 A: yeah 

429.37 439.77 B: exactly there's there's a little sentence that goes around on the internet a lot i believe it was um it it's not it's a joke but it's not like a joke 

439.89 449.24 B: and it was something to the effect of a professor in in some class asked his class to punctuate the following sentence 

448.64 450.40 A: mm yeah [laughter] 

449.76 451.05 B: you've read that one 

450.75 451.88 A: yeah 

451.28 455.65 B: yeah that's now see to me that's it's cute it's cute 

456.07 458.33 B: but i liked old time humor 

459.24 467.91 B: some i can't remember his name it was a short guy with glasses and about thirty years ago i'm dating myself now but 

467.49 468.49 A: [laughter] 

468.90 475.60 B: um and he did really funny stuff even even listen to his album more than once and still laugh at some of the stuff on it i 

475.62 482.78 B: think the funniest things in the world are things that that bring attention to what we do 

483.13 486.03 B: and how silly some of what we do is 

485.81 489.31 A: yeah when we laugh at ourselves instead of laughing at 

487.44 488.32 B: yeah 

489.36 491.88 A: perhaps people who are different than us 

491.65 494.42 B: yeah yeah exactly 

494.54 496.48 A: yeah 

495.18 497.33 B: i agree with that 

497.55 500.45 B: well i think we've come to an agreement on that 

499.83 501.51 A: yeah i would say so 

501.45 504.49 B: absolutely i wonder how long they want us to talk 

504.08 508.17 A: i don't know i was not paying attention to the time when we started talking 

507.96 510.27 B: i don't think it's ten minutes yet 

509.64 511.55 A: yeah i don't think so 

512.02 518.95 A: and i've never this is the first call i've done so i don't know if they like notify us when the time is up do you 

518.07 522.92 B: i suspect they would um this is the first call i've done as well 

522.50 523.33 A: [laughter] 

523.19 529.04 B: i wasn't even sure it was legitimate because when i was looking at the the the theo- 

529.53 537.00 B: the theoretical paperwork on the web they were inquiring and asking for a social security number which i don't give to anybody 

537.47 542.68 B: and i can't imagine why they would want it and then i closed the program out 

542.86 544.89 B: yet they still got me 

545.45 547.20 B: which i thought was interesting 

546.89 547.83 A: huh 

548.78 549.99 A: (( that is interesting )) 

548.97 555.61 B: i i don't know why they wanted a social security number and then upon not receiving it still went ahead 

554.95 556.25 A: yeah 

555.96 558.30 B: that's what made me think it was a little fishy 

558.67 561.38 B: but it seems to be legitimate 

561.40 562.43 A: (( well i )) 

562.50 566.97 A: i sure hope it is or else we're both in trouble huh [laughter] 

565.17 571.83 B: [laughter] i'm very curious what it is that they're studying it's certainly not anything about comedy 

571.80 575.24 A: no because there is a gazillion different topics on there 

574.63 575.91 B: yeah 

575.27 576.15 A: um 

575.95 578.47 B: it's something about the way we speak to one other 

579.21 580.60 A: i guess so 

580.66 585.72 A: and considering we're from different parts of the country maybe we're good candidates for that [laughter] 

585.00 588.57 B: yeah well as long as i've got you on the phone let me ask you a question 

588.32 589.43 A: mhm 

589.09 596.46 B: is there an island off of south carolina that's primarily wildlife oriented but some people live there 

597.38 598.75 A: um
