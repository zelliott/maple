0.18 2.93 B: hi this is jane wright 

2.76 4.93 A: hi this is karen williams 

4.51 6.21 B: hi karen [noise] 

6.01 12.10 A: hi this is the first time i've done this so i'm not sure exactly how to do it but i guess we just talk about how 

12.35 14.42 A: how terrorism affects people 

14.01 21.47 B: that's right and um just so you know this is my first time too so we're we'll be virgins together 

14.76 15.45 A: (( so okay )) 

18.59 20.24 A: oh okay [laughter] 

21.27 27.14 A: okay well i kinda think that's a no brainer i think terrorism scares every- everybody to terrorism [noise] 

26.44 31.14 B: that's right and i think they wanted us to talk about how we would react when 

31.31 38.93 B: um if a terrorist attack happens and i think i would probably be pretty freaked out 

39.19 41.71 A: (( yeah well there's a i was )) 

39.21 40.09 B: so 

42.23 44.35 A: on a trip a bus trip 

44.36 47.57 A: and as far as we knew because we didn't [mn] 

49.13 50.12 B: are you there 

50.44 51.65 A: i'm here are you there 

51.29 55.59 B: yeah i'm here it's just we're kind of breaking up so um 

52.21 53.64 A: (( okay so )) 

54.30 66.46 A: okay i'm on i'm on a cell phone that that'd be why but yeah i was on a bus trip and and you know when we heard about the towers being bombed i panicked because i was away from home i was away from my children 

57.55 58.73 B: oh okay 

66.46 72.75 A: and i think that's how most parents would react you know a terrorist attack is is where my i 

69.76 70.86 B: oh yeah 

72.99 76.33 B: where where were you when you were on this bus trip 

79.46 87.10 A: was away from any help um but it was far enough where because i wasn't in control i didn't have a vehicle that i was driving 

84.98 85.91 B: yes 

87.31 90.23 A: um that was an especially panicked feeling 

89.83 92.72 B: oh yes i know well i was 

93.02 95.01 B: it was a very um 

95.44 103.12 B: panicky i felt panic even though i was in my home and i was safe i just thought oh god you know what's what's coming next 

102.98 104.49 A: right right 

103.31 104.38 B: and 

104.81 119.14 B: so but i was i was [laughter] very glad i live in ohio and i was very glad that we were far away from it but and it was a very scary thing and now it's it's scary to know that that you know that 

119.10 127.43 B: um osama he's he's out there somewhere and we still haven't been able to f- to find him or capture him and and 

122.39 123.08 A: (( yeah )) 

126.79 129.63 A: now there's splinter groups that go along with him 

129.11 133.43 B: yeah and i don't know did you see the news the other night where they were um 

134.28 144.32 B: [sigh] they were like interviewing um different people on the street and over there and they said that you know if osama came to my house i would hide him and 

143.99 145.91 A: exactly exactly 

144.86 151.03 B: and it's it's no wonder we can't find him if all these people are still willing to to hide him 

151.14 152.84 B: and [mn] 

152.77 156.31 A: and you know i was just saying to my children i don't think that we can really blame 

156.18 159.14 A: the majority of people f- for feeling that way because 

158.93 172.15 A: in countries like that they're only allowed to hear what the government wants them to hear and know what the government wants them to know and so as far as they're concerned america is the bad place that they portray it to be and they never hear about the good in america 

162.94 164.27 B: exactly 

169.21 170.18 B: right 

171.95 172.75 B: right 

172.12 184.13 A: so i i can understand why the people feel that way but [mn] you would think that with their relatives or friends that have come over here to be educated now that's what really really bothers me is is that we educate these terrorists and then they go back home and do that 

183.85 184.93 B: i know 

184.87 188.39 B: isn't i mean that is so scary and i mean just like when 

188.26 202.65 B: this first all happened and they were saying that um the the gentleman that had an airline flight training school and he trained them and you know we we give them this this education and 

198.55 199.61 A: (( yeah )) 

202.74 203.89 B: then they go 

204.61 208.43 B: they go back to their country and they use all this training against us 

208.64 211.75 A: and that's just it's just crazy yeah 

208.82 209.70 B: it's like 

211.13 214.65 B: you know and then then they wonder why you know 

215.22 223.13 B: [mn] i don't know these liberal groups i guess you know like why are we so down about you know why don't we want to tighten restrictions and it's like 

222.50 224.00 A: yeah yeah right 

223.39 231.92 B: it's because we don't we don't want these people coming over here and us giving them this free education or this free information and then them leaving 

232.25 233.19 A: right 

232.50 234.42 B: and using it against us 

233.97 235.35 A: (( exactly exactly )) 

234.91 240.15 B: i mean you just wonder what we have to do to make ourselves safe 

240.36 249.67 A: yeah i think with a terrorist attack one of the the scariest things is not knowing what's coming next i know when the towers were hit i was thinking is this the beginning is this the beginning are they going to be hitting 

249.54 258.35 A: targets all across the u._s. um are they going to be hitting major cities next or you know move from the east coast right across the country to the west coast is it a very planned attack or what 

257.86 258.85 B: right 

258.22 267.51 A: which which that ah that was the being being like i said away from my family that's why it was such a panic feeling for me and and what if it's just the beginning right now 

267.10 270.81 B: right right and you know [laughter] it's 

268.16 268.80 A: (( so )) 

270.99 283.24 B: you know god bless the people that gave their lives in that airplane that went down but you know i didn't they say that that one was targeted for the white house can you imagine if they were successful 

275.96 276.52 A: (( [mn] )) 

280.08 281.41 A: yeah yeah 

281.48 282.22 A: yeah 

283.24 287.05 A: and managed to take out the president and vice president and all the leaders of the country 

285.66 286.56 B: yeah 

286.73 297.90 B: i mean and it [mn] you know who knows they probably might may or may not have been able to get you know the president and vice president out in time i mean because it just 

298.07 299.34 B: it was just 

299.39 300.40 B: you know 

299.47 301.21 A: (( [noise] it would have been utter chaos )) 

300.78 303.65 B: yeah and it was just such a surprise 

303.99 305.38 A: and even so even 

304.03 304.99 B: i mean 

305.39 316.33 A: [mn] all we had on the bus were people with cell phones and i know i kept trying and trying and trying to use mine but the air time was just so filled up with everybody calling everybody across the united states that that the cell phones weren't working 

316.27 317.26 B: right 

316.54 318.54 A: and yeah so 

317.43 320.22 B: so now where where is your family at 

320.45 321.41 B: (( that you were tr- )) 

320.50 321.98 A: oh we live in michigan 

321.63 323.39 B: michigan oh okay 

322.63 324.76 A: (( mhm yeah yeah )) 

324.72 327.96 B: [sigh] yeah it was that was a very ah 

328.54 336.35 B: a very scary day i swear i have never been so glued to my television set i mean i think i was that way for the whole week 

332.51 333.36 A: yeah 

333.72 334.54 A: yeah 

336.25 339.29 A: (( yeah yeah trying to find out more information it )) 

338.41 342.13 B: yeah and oh my god i just 

342.65 346.22 B: you know all the devastation that happened and and 

343.12 343.81 A: was 

345.58 356.14 A: it was definitely a wake up call for america we were pretty compla- complacent about going through our lives and nobody's going to touch us and and we can be touched and we can be touched pretty hard 

347.84 348.59 B: yep 

355.42 356.38 B: right 

356.73 362.30 B: and you know it's just like it's like you said it's it was a big wake up call because you know here we 

356.75 357.57 A: but 

362.37 371.00 B: just feel so safe and we feel like we're in this little cocoon and then all of a sudden something like that happens and it just 

367.18 368.27 A: mhm 

371.14 372.44 A: (( [noise] )) 

372.08 373.45 B: bursts your bubble 

372.53 382.19 A: makes [mn] yeah it makes us think twice about countries like israel where it's a dail- it's a daily way of life for them they don't know where a terrorist attack is going to come from 

379.09 380.07 B: yes 

382.07 383.03 B: (( [sigh] )) 

383.99 387.29 B: it just i just can't imagine i guess living with that 

384.43 385.06 A: (( [cough] )) 

387.93 395.79 B: day to day i mean we are to some degree you know we're thinking okay you know especially with us you know the the 

396.03 399.51 B: war looming over our heads with saddam 

399.40 400.48 A: mhm 

399.74 400.73 B: um 

401.11 402.89 B: but [mn] you know i 

403.46 411.34 B: you know i worry about it and but i guess i'm not i don't live in fear every day like 

411.64 416.96 A: yeah but is that because you really don't think it could happen again because it was such an isolated event 

416.43 418.47 B: no i guess 

419.29 423.12 B: i guess it's because [mn] i don't know i i 

423.13 432.06 B: i feel safe that our country can protect us i mean yeah you know we have these these terrorist attacks but as far as the war i guess 

432.01 440.86 B: because it hasn't hasn't happened yet i'm not living in fear of it i mean i i dread it and the repercussions and the fact that you know 

441.32 453.05 B: there's going to be men and women out there you know losing their lives and because it's inevitable in a war that you know you're going to have a certain amount of casualties and but i guess i'm not [sigh] 

453.33 458.07 B: i'm not fearful of war yet because it's not here but 

458.08 464.25 B: [mn] there again i guess it goes back to i feel like i'm in this little cocoon you know i'm safe i feel 

464.27 472.14 B: safe and protected in my little home in in in ohio you know like ther- [laughter] ohio i don't 

466.78 468.14 A: (( yeah [noise] [laughter] )) 

468.64 470.23 A: (( yeah ahah [laughter] )) 

470.85 473.39 A: who's going to attack ohio yeah [laughter] 

472.20 481.05 B: yeah i don't think there's anything in ohio that anybody would you know we do have wright pat but wright patterson air force base where they do 

478.79 479.47 A: [laughter] 

480.22 481.54 A: (( [laughter] yeah ahah ahah )) 

481.19 486.67 B: do do send a lot of um recruits out of but i don't know i'm 

486.84 487.95 B: maybe i'm 

487.06 490.27 A: (( that may be further down on the list of of hits [laughter] mhm )) 

489.77 493.71 B: maybe i'm too naive about the whole situation but i'm 

493.72 496.67 B: i i i don't like the fact that um 

497.25 498.74 B: [mn] you know we've got 

498.75 501.02 B: the threat of war looming 

501.03 502.77 B: over our heads but 

503.65 504.32 B: i 

503.78 507.58 A: and i guess i don't understand the people that are protesting it 

506.84 508.14 B: oh i know 

508.44 509.52 B: i know 

508.77 512.65 A: saddam is sheltering actively sheltering in a plot 

513.58 515.64 B: i'm sorry you're breaking up again 

515.92 517.37 A: um can you hear me 

516.95 517.84 B: yeah 

517.76 519.92 A: okay i was saying you know i it's 

520.51 523.70 A: they they know that saddam has been sheltering 

523.83 525.11 A: the terrorists 

525.13 529.30 A: and that he openly applauds what the terrorists are doing and have done 

529.51 541.36 A: and what do they think saddam's going to do in the future change his mind the people that are sh- that are that are saying no war no war what are we supposed to do wait until he does attack us until he personally attacks us with his country 

537.63 538.67 B: right 

540.72 548.06 B: i know i i just don't understand it i mean certainly if we all had our choice we would not 

549.35 560.05 B: want to go to war and we would not you know we're not it's not like we started it like you know oh we're just going we just want to have a war with saddam just because we want to have a war

567.88 568.75 A: yeah 

571.47 581.34 B: this is something that we really want to do and it's it's it's a big decision for the you know for our president to have to do this because he knows that his 

580.27 582.36 A: necessary evil yeah 

581.69 589.10 B: sending you know america's sons and daughters off to hi sweetheart my son just got up from his nap so um
