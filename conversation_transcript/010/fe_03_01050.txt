9.21 13.20 B: i guess the question is how do we draw the line between humor and bad taste huh 

13.30 13.74 A: mhm 

14.18 14.78 B: um 

16.52 17.69 B: i don't know how do you 

18.19 18.91 B: how do you do that 

19.32 22.02 A: um most of the time when i see humor 

22.26 24.93 A: that has a lot of cuss in it or vulgar language 

25.49 29.08 A: i think that is very bad taste i think that a lot of situations that 

29.46 31.61 A: you run across on a daily basis 

31.80 34.35 A: can be funny without having the cussing 

34.64 35.80 A: and the vulgar language 

36.18 39.50 A: uh some of the skits they are like borderline a lot of sex 

39.98 41.92 A: uh some of those are offensive as well 

42.57 43.48 A: so um 

43.83 48.26 A: i think i draw the line when i hear a a lot of that going on in in comedy 

66.48 67.97 B: hurt or something you know 

68.46 68.88 B: i just 

69.40 71.84 B: i just don't find that humorous in any way -cause 

71.99 74.23 B: that you're you're making fun of somebody who 

75.27 78.71 B: can't help the situation or something you know i just don't see getting 

78.97 79.47 B: humor 

79.67 80.53 B: getting your kicks off 

80.65 81.94 B: somebody else being down 

83.08 83.44 B: yeah 

83.14 84.61 A: right i i agree with that 

84.99 86.62 A: and um a lot of times 

87.02 91.30 A: even when they do a lot of humorous stuff sometimes the borderline 

91.68 92.19 A: um 

92.56 95.48 A: i think when they can't find um or at the (( )) 

95.93 97.26 A: i guess actors 

97.38 100.59 A: they try to go to another sideline in order to make it funny 

100.83 101.23 B: yeah 

101.28 102.28 A: and um 

102.42 106.22 A: it doesn't always work for me i feel really like offensive when they do that 

107.24 110.51 B: i found i've actually cut out quite a bit of my t._v. watching 

110.85 111.29 B: not just 

111.48 112.71 B: because of that i have a 

113.21 115.88 B: baby so you know one i'm going to be choosy about 

116.26 119.55 B: even more choosy you know now that she is you know a child 

120.03 122.33 B: little baby you know but i don't have time to watch 

122.43 123.01 B: that and 

123.70 125.79 B: i just don't have time to fool with it you know 

126.89 128.30 B: usually i like something like 

128.94 130.35 B: brady bunch or lucy 

130.95 132.86 B: you know those kinds of things are usually funny 

133.55 134.27 B: you know when 

134.46 135.88 B: everybody is laughing about 

136.74 137.91 B: goof up or something 

138.17 141.21 A: and then i think those things lasted through (( )) times 

141.49 141.92 B: yeah 

142.06 145.87 A: um i think with the new age um -cause i also have a teenager 

146.38 148.01 A: with the rap coming in to play 

148.57 150.23 A: a lot of times the rap music 

150.71 157.20 A: um a lot of it has the cuss and stuff in it and i think when that became accepted 

153.27 153.83 B: oh yeah 

157.62 160.22 A: then comedy became accepted on the same line 

160.24 160.81 B: mhm 

160.77 162.71 A: and um i think in real life 

162.87 163.55 A: what happens 

163.98 168.38 A: is that there is a borderline because we are so used to seeing so many bad things 

168.75 173.56 A: that we tend to accept so many things now that we would have done a long time ago 

174.52 177.63 B: uh i i know this isn't comedy but i've even found some of the 

178.18 182.10 B: c._s._i. programs i tell my husband that you know we enjoy those but 

182.87 183.96 B: like each week 

184.08 185.31 B: they go a step further 

185.85 189.80 B: a step further you know and showing stuff that really doesn't need to be shown 

190.38 195.30 B: and and i think that carries over in some of the comedy stuff too because some of the things they make fun of 

195.80 196.36 B: are things that 

196.63 197.26 B: you know just 

197.94 200.14 B: like they say are just completely distasteful 

200.40 201.52 B: they they it's just 

202.18 205.90 B: it is just not even something that should be a subject to discuss you know 

207.34 210.52 A: and i think like i said we've become so accepting 

210.75 211.81 A: to so many things 

212.30 213.98 A: that we turn a blind eye 

214.56 218.70 A: and so since we turn a blind eye the producers are pushing more and more 
219.08 220.15 A: and um 

220.43 223.12 A: i think that if you wanted to go in to that line of comedy 

223.40 225.28 A: then you should have a choice of going to 

225.67 227.82 A: uh some type of theater setting or 

228.18 229.62 A: some kind of showroom setting 

229.92 234.28 A: and see it live and have a choice of whether you want to see it or hear it as opposed to 

234.71 237.26 A: uh having to see it or hear it on television 

237.60 240.97 A: with these borderline uh undercurrents of um 

241.34 242.47 A: sex and 

242.66 244.54 A: vulgar conversations and 

244.92 245.39 A: um 

245.53 247.96 A: cussing and you know some things that 

248.24 250.07 A: you know we couldn't say even growing up 

250.17 250.58 B: no 

250.28 258.87 A: has been accepted you know and people laugh at it -cause they think that you know it's so accepting to do it but i think that is why so many people now are so disrespectful 

251.46 251.99 B: oh yeah 

259.11 260.38 A: because of the fact that 

260.54 261.59 A: we are used to hearing it 

261.72 262.25 B: mhm 

263.36 265.43 B: yeah i agree uh 

265.81 266.09 B: just 

266.64 271.47 B: you know there again that's why i've chosen to kind of turn the t._v. off most of the time 

272.51 277.64 B: you know that is all i feel i can do about it and you know until more people start doing that 

278.19 285.63 B: it is just going to keep getting worse -cause it it's kind of we are in the thrill society now where you have to (( won )) up everybody so i think that is what 

286.15 288.48 B: you know they have to get the newest latest greatest 

289.07 293.88 B: so we are not worried about what is classic and what will hold we are trying for the next best thing so 

295.27 296.52 B: jerry seinfeld or 

297.47 299.11 B: (( )) springer or something you know 

299.38 303.23 B: i've never watched that but you know just even seeing the advertisements for it 

304.11 306.13 B: you know i know people watch that just for fun 

306.59 308.69 A: well i think another thing too is that 

309.23 313.01 A: my sense of humor and other people's sense of humor probably 

313.41 319.33 A: would differ a lot a lot of things that they show on these comedy shows they think is funny 

319.45 322.80 A: and i find more enjoyment out of the old classic 

323.37 325.58 A: than i do in the newer things because 

325.86 327.66 A: a lot of it just isn't funny to me 

328.43 330.74 A: and especially when i have to 

331.04 331.56 A: um 

332.27 341.47 A: you're always suspecting that there is an undercurrent somewhere and you are not sure whether to let your kids watch it or not before it comes on because u- they are so used to doing it 

334.91 335.34 B: mhm 

341.73 342.57 A: it just happens 

343.08 344.80 A: so when they say something 

345.10 347.42 A: and it has an undercurrent effects or 

347.54 348.15 A: whatever 

348.53 348.99 A: or 

349.28 353.71 A: uh something that is cussing or whatever you are not really sure whether you know you want to just like 

354.16 356.39 A: not say anything and let it pass or 

356.67 360.97 A: you know i'm not even really sure how you are supposed to watch t._v. anymore you can't grade that way 

361.25 361.60 B: yeah 

362.40 362.87 B: um 

363.07 367.16 B: i know i was brought up in a christian home in a minister's home so you know 

368.60 370.57 B: i'm not stupid but you know 

370.69 373.19 B: i can be kind of innocent minded and even now 

373.60 377.43 B: you know i'm i'm not real old but i'm not you know a teenager either but 
378.57 381.16 B: my i'll be like oh what was that or i'll i'll 

381.25 385.78 B: tell my husband you know you'll get some of these funny things over the computer i'm like i don't get it 

386.78 387.29 B: and 

386.82 388.37 A: exactly i agree with that 

387.82 394.32 B: and and he and it's not that he has a dirty mind or something he has just been exposed to more things and he is like christy it 

394.87 395.60 B: such and such 

396.00 396.78 B: i'm like oh my 

396.90 397.58 B: gosh 

397.40 398.73 A: mhm exactly 

398.27 401.60 B: that just wasn't i said oh i wish i didn't get it you know 

401.19 402.36 A: right right 

401.82 403.32 B: that wasn't even uh for you know 

403.68 408.51 B: sometimes even on an innocent level it might be funny but you know and that is where other people 

408.77 411.37 B: were getting there kicks off of me in high school and you know 

412.13 413.74 B: they would get something that 

414.11 416.10 B: you know like they would bring rubbers or something 

416.63 417.23 B: you know 

417.63 421.95 B: like okay whatever (( )) and i wa- you know i didn't know what they were talking about 

421.94 422.81 A: exactly 

422.60 427.07 B: -cause i didn't do that then they knew that so they were you know laughing at me but oh well 

427.70 428.15 B: you know 

428.99 433.89 A: so you know i think i i think that a lot of things needs to be need to be changed 

434.51 437.01 A: i'm not sure if congress i hearing us when we 

437.33 440.37 A: voice our opinions on some of the s- the stories but 

440.48 443.84 A: even on the things that we buy and it has a rating on it 

443.96 444.28 B: mhm 

444.16 445.33 A: i think they need to rate 

445.63 448.46 A: a little bit harder on some of our t._v. programs 

448.55 449.35 B: oh yeah 

458.54 460.21 A: coming to the situation because 

460.62 464.14 A: you need to know if you are planning to take a child or if you take -em to 

464.27 472.74 A: uh a young adult or whatever but they have they are going to have these undercurrents there and some people may find it funny but a lot of people still feel it's very offensive 

473.52 475.63 B: i still don't understand though how 

477.04 480.73 B: you know i talk to people like yourself who find it offensive 

481.13 485.37 B: there is many of us that find it offensive but it's just like we don't know what to do about it 

486.27 487.56 B: you know so it keeps 

488.12 492.70 B: going and getting worse you know and then you have the sector over here who is complaining about 

493.18 494.76 B: free speech and making 

495.22 496.62 B: these things worse you know 

497.28 499.02 B: so it's almost like a competition 

499.67 500.20 B: you know 

500.57 501.13 A: and i think 

501.43 506.75 A: it's like um we live on an edge of something i think we are so used to seeing so much stuff where 

507.13 510.80 A: we are like on the edge of society it is hard to find a new thrill 

511.06 511.40 B: yeah
