24.49 26.24 A: so it is what if you would lie on the 

26.39 27.03 A: stand 

27.51 28.38 A: for a family member 

28.51 29.33 B: yeah or a close 

29.43 30.45 B: friend if you think you would 

30.69 31.54 B: commit perjury 

32.22 33.59 B: i would like to say i wouldn't 

34.21 34.87 B: just because 

35.72 38.41 B: i would hope i would be honest but 

38.98 43.13 B: i don't know i mean it is kind of a hard hyp- hypothetical situation 

43.33 44.38 A: right not knowing what is 

44.84 47.03 A: the charge would be um 

46.78 48.39 B: right 

47.23 48.96 A: i don't lie very well but i think 

49.50 49.99 A: i would 

50.21 52.38 A: look like i was lying up on the stand 

52.71 53.30 B: right 

52.72 53.19 A: um 

53.48 53.82 A: and 

54.23 56.48 A: but i would be tempted to i guess if it was a 

57.17 58.02 A: major 

58.24 59.53 A: thing you know a life 

59.90 60.83 A: altering like 

60.95 61.42 A: uh 

62.52 63.45 A: murder or 

64.21 65.69 A: kidnapping something like that 

65.64 66.09 B: right 

67.00 67.96 A: tempting but 

68.36 68.98 A: i think i would 

69.29 71.25 A: fall under pressure if they started to 

72.08 73.59 A: question me more than just having to 

73.79 74.97 A: lie with a yes or no 

75.39 79.49 B: right yeah i don't think i could yeah i don't think i could make up a story 
76.19 77.06 A: back up the lie 

79.66 81.70 B: for them yeah i'm not a good liar either 

81.86 82.36 B: (( said )) 

83.44 84.00 B: so 

84.17 86.51 A: yeah i think it it would be very difficult but it would 

86.64 87.90 A: it would be very tempting 

88.18 88.51 B: yes 

89.87 92.23 A: but i guess and depending on who the relative is is it a 

92.85 93.85 A: cousin or a 

94.66 95.72 A: husband or 

96.59 97.14 A: child 

97.54 98.10 B: right 

98.23 100.06 B: and was it um i think part of it 

100.16 101.51 B: uh in my mind would be 

101.92 105.68 B: was it intentional i mean were they did they fall asleep driving and 

105.84 108.44 B: hit someone and are they going to go to jail for life 

108.92 109.93 B: or is it 

110.15 111.15 B: you know if they are just 

111.36 114.04 B: if they've gone off the deep end and they really 

114.46 116.58 B: should go to jail because my goodness they are a threat 

116.69 117.36 B: (( to )) society 

118.00 118.37 A: right 

118.05 122.77 B: you know i think i mean i don't know i'd have i would have to kind of weight that 

123.34 124.51 B: i don't know i think it would be tempting i 

125.64 126.76 B: i don't know if i could ever do it 

127.28 127.94 A: yeah i i just 

127.34 129.22 B: (( so )) 

128.32 129.66 A: don't know if i could just because 

129.87 130.39 A: then if you 

130.67 131.66 A: did get caught 

131.98 133.61 B: right 

132.26 135.21 A: and they were able to prove it then you are going to be in the same situation they are 

135.23 135.89 B: right 

137.72 138.70 A: that far in to it 

139.03 140.90 B: right 

139.17 139.47 A: but 

139.60 141.61 A: it it does have a lot to do with what they are 

142.05 143.67 A: they are being tried on you know 

143.86 144.25 A: and there is 

144.92 146.32 A: there is certainly cases you know we've had 

146.46 147.69 A: southern oregon where 

148.33 148.68 A: the 

148.85 150.77 A: a couple of police officers were killed 

151.28 152.24 A: by the side of the road 

152.64 153.09 B: uh-huh 

152.75 153.23 A: um 

153.60 154.06 A: because 

155.65 156.25 A: guy that was 

156.36 157.54 A: driving fell asleep 

157.78 158.27 B: uh-huh 

158.36 159.07 A: and um 

159.93 160.34 A: they 

161.13 162.74 A: they let -em off which is very minimal 

163.05 164.33 A: i mean i don't think he even went to jail 

164.75 165.32 B: wow 

165.52 165.84 A: he 

167.00 167.88 A: really didn't 

168.19 169.64 A: mean to do it he wasn't 

170.07 171.96 A: you know he was just like a student who had driven 

172.12 172.77 A: too far 

173.10 174.00 B: right 

173.26 175.08 A: he was a good kid and just felt 

175.45 176.87 A: absolutely horrible about it 

175.51 177.38 B: yeah 

177.42 177.82 A: and 

177.98 180.63 A: the families of these police officers agreed that 

181.37 183.93 A: uh it wasn't intentional he didn't mean to do it and 

184.26 185.97 A: putting him in jail was not going to serve 

186.40 187.01 A: any purpose 

187.00 187.50 B: right 

187.99 189.16 A: so i believe he had to do 

191.29 192.27 B: yeah 

191.56 193.30 A: something like that i think he would be tempted to 

194.12 194.53 A: you know 

194.71 197.45 A: know they probably didn't do it and you don't want them to go away 

198.17 198.79 A: for life 

198.20 198.74 B: yeah 

199.03 200.11 A: when they didn't mean to 

199.55 204.44 B: but it seems like with something like that you could be honest and say 

205.02 206.56 B: your reasons why you think 

207.16 208.27 B: they shouldn't have 

208.40 211.33 B: such a severe penalty or things like that without having to 

211.79 212.91 B: actually lie about it 

213.13 214.70 B: so it seems like you could 

213.21 213.60 A: right 

215.93 217.51 B: you know avoid that 

218.77 219.19 A: i guess it 

218.91 219.84 B: in a lot of ways 

219.94 222.25 A: if it came to you know that type of situation and 

222.48 224.75 A: say that you had been out with him that night 

225.18 227.22 A: and they knew you've been out with him and say he had 

227.59 228.35 A: one beer 

229.02 229.72 B: uh-huh 

229.08 231.00 A: and they ask you was he drinking 

231.46 233.77 A: and you are thinking if i say he had one beer 

233.54 234.73 B: oh yeah 

234.13 235.36 A: they are going to say he was drunk 

235.99 236.48 B: yeah 

236.89 239.68 A: which he might i know he probably wasn't and he really didn't 

240.38 241.03 A: (( not )) mean 

241.55 241.97 A: what he was 

242.20 242.67 A: doing 

242.72 243.42 B: right 

243.36 243.77 A: um 

244.22 246.42 A: i guess that is where you would probably come in to it saying 

246.83 248.29 A: should i really tell them he had a drink 

248.74 251.33 B: right yeah smaller things like that or 

252.03 254.99 B: they are not small but i mean things like that that are kind of 

255.24 256.37 B: well is it 

256.96 258.97 B: will it make a difference and 

259.19 259.66 A: yeah 

259.26 259.95 B: yeah 

260.09 261.43 A: i would just be afraid of the whole 

261.66 265.26 A: you know rather than just asking question saying yes or no and then if they started trying 

266.25 269.76 A: back it up with something like the drink thing i guess they could back up saying 

267.74 269.71 B: right 

270.37 271.35 A: well the bartender said 

271.71 272.70 A: he did have a drink 

271.71 275.77 B: he did oh wow you are in trouble right 

272.90 275.16 A: and you were sitting there and had one with him you know 

276.03 276.81 A: something like that 

277.37 279.35 B: yeah 

278.58 278.96 A: so 

279.56 279.87 A: that's 

280.02 280.30 A: a lot of 

281.45 282.27 A: (( )) has baby 

281.52 285.20 B: yeah yes trying to get up here 

286.90 287.71 B: yeah 

288.21 289.75 A: uh yeah i think it all depends on the 

290.06 291.07 A: circumstances and 

291.95 293.01 A: and what goes along with it 

293.26 293.62 A: but 

293.35 293.76 B: right 

294.49 297.16 A: but it is not a real yes or no yes i would no i wouldn't 

297.82 298.59 A: kind of answer 

298.88 299.38 B: yeah 

300.33 302.27 B: i guess that is why we have ten minutes to talk about it 

302.32 303.80 A: (( yeah i guess so )) 

302.37 306.62 B: so we can come up with different hypothetical situations but yeah i 

307.09 308.50 B: i agree and i think 

309.21 310.02 B: i mean like i said i 

310.25 311.92 B: i would hope that i wouldn't 

312.43 313.55 B: lie about it because 

315.13 317.03 B: we shouldn't but 

315.87 316.67 A: (( )) right 

318.79 320.10 B: yeah 

318.93 320.74 A: like i could imagine how it would weigh 

321.61 322.47 A: on your mind if 

322.79 323.42 B: yeah 

323.29 323.73 A: if you 

324.49 325.98 A: if you did or didn't i guess 

325.98 326.78 B: either way 

326.79 327.26 A: yeah 

326.85 329.60 B: right depending on could i have changed this and 

330.20 338.48 B: but i think too you you just have to tell yourself too well it is not i'm not involved i didn't do anything you know if 

338.83 342.40 B: if you told the truth and they were guilty you just 

342.88 349.00 B: i don't know you would feel guilty but you would also just say well they did it and that is the consequence and 

349.63 351.01 B: it is too bad i didn't 

351.85 353.07 B: couldn't change that but 

353.26 353.72 A: mhm 

353.63 354.33 B: i- you know 

355.17 356.32 B: i don't know if that makes sense but 

357.23 357.60 A: yeah 

358.42 359.28 A: it is really a tough call 

359.71 360.26 B: yeah 

360.27 361.51 A: it is going to depend on 

363.54 364.27 A: are you going to lie -cause 

364.47 364.89 A: uh 

365.07 366.43 A: you know there is two sets of books 

367.60 367.87 A: um 

368.23 368.93 B: yes 

369.25 369.56 A: and 

369.98 371.00 A: you would lose your job 

371.94 372.22 A: i guess 

373.15 373.50 A: i don't know 

375.01 375.90 B: so many tests 

376.39 376.82 A: yeah 

377.33 378.12 B: situation 

378.51 379.27 B: you know different 

379.76 380.58 B: situations i guess 

380.82 381.50 A: yeah i mean 

381.77 383.55 A: it could be embezzlement it could be 

383.66 385.45 A: you know murder or something like that you just 

385.92 386.77 A: don't know and i guess 

387.08 387.92 A: -til it happens you 

388.52 389.53 A: wouldn't know but yeah i 

389.77 392.48 A: i would hope i wouldn't have to lie because i would just feel horrible about it 

392.44 393.02 B: right 

393.06 395.07 A: unless i think it would be like going around with this guilt 

395.85 400.30 B: oh yeah you would never right then you would never 

396.47 398.53 A: you are afraid you are going to get caught at any minute 

400.97 404.83 B: oh and you would never feel a hundred percent okay a- about it and 

401.30 402.15 A: you would never be able to relax 

403.47 404.06 A: yeah 

405.76 407.24 A: so i don't think that would be easy to do 

406.79 409.55 B: yeah 

408.76 409.04 A: but 

409.58 411.31 A: how long have we been talking do you got any idea 

409.64 414.08 B: i don't know when they called me though they said 

414.18 416.71 B: the computer will give you a prompt saying 

416.83 423.36 B: you have thirty seconds left or something so i guess we have to keep talking i don't know i haven't been timing but 

418.51 419.93 A: oh okay 

420.70 421.86 A: i guess so 

424.44 427.12 A: uh i'm trying to think um hypothetical and 

424.46 425.42 B: um 

428.79 429.22 A: um 

430.62 431.20 A: i don't know i 

432.11 433.15 A: i'm saying i'd probably 

433.32 434.15 A: i guess i wouldn't 

434.53 435.92 B: yeah 

436.44 437.45 B: i don't think i would either 

440.06 440.77 A: it would be too hard 

441.27 444.76 A: you know you weren't telling the truth and i i just think i would get busted up on the stand anyway 

445.64 446.10 A: i 

445.83 447.09 B: i would too we play those 

447.61 454.21 B: murder mystery games or whatever where i don't know if you've ever played those but i can not lie they can always tell when i'm the mafia or whatever -cause i'm like 

449.41 449.84 A: uh-huh 

453.77 454.33 A: (( right )) 

454.37 456.69 B: you know so 

456.79 457.37 A: yeah i think i'd get 

457.51 457.83 A: kind of 

459.04 461.45 A: i think i get a strange look on my face when i'm lying and 

461.43 462.06 B: yeah 

462.68 463.20 A: trying not 

463.42 465.63 A: look like i'm not lying is what i do i think and then 

465.90 466.74 A: it just looks funny 

466.85 468.80 B: right and people are like what 

467.05 467.33 A: so 

468.89 470.25 A: yeah so i think that would just 

469.44 470.17 B: hm 

470.75 471.37 A: pull them in 

471.82 476.25 B: yeah well and you never know who is going to testify after you it is like you said someone could 

472.34 473.28 A: and i would get (( )) 

477.20 477.73 B: totally just 

477.81 479.62 B: (( dispute )) and then you would be like 

480.19 481.28 B: well i'm just 

481.38 484.93 B: kidding i really didn't meant that and can't really do that so 

483.23 483.68 A: right 

485.35 485.75 A: and i guess 

485.93 486.61 A: you never know if 

487.27 488.08 A: they would actually 

488.81 491.61 A: try and nail you for perjury a lot of times i don't think they do 

492.05 492.53 B: oh really 

492.64 493.66 A: unless it was something that 

494.44 495.86 A: really effected their case 

496.14 497.15 B: right 

496.29 496.55 A: and 

496.80 497.13 A: going to 

497.29 498.16 A: hit you for what you did 

498.50 499.17 B: yeah 

499.16 499.42 A: but 

500.34 501.71 A: i don't know if they really would or not 

502.18 502.81 B: i don't know 

502.90 504.57 B: yeah i probably depends on how big of a 

504.92 506.36 B: difference it made in the outcome 

506.91 507.29 A: yeah 

506.94 507.70 B: i would think 

508.54 509.94 A: lie about them not having (( )) 

510.41 511.61 A: but they did because of that 

512.58 512.90 A: you know 

513.65 514.11 A: he was 

514.27 516.30 A: shot over the books or something i mean 

516.11 516.62 B: right 

518.44 518.91 A: i don't know 

520.18 520.72 A: tough call 

521.44 523.79 A: i don't know if it is something you can talk about ten minutes with 

523.75 525.59 B: i guess i don't know 

526.34 527.24 B: oh 

528.43 530.26 A: it must not be ten -cause they haven't said anything
