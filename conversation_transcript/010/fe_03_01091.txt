28.28 31.07 B: have you did you think about that while they were connecting us 

31.52 40.47 A: yes i did i am uh but eh whenever they had said a million dollars to leave at the beginning they didn't specify that you couldn't return so that changes things 

31.61 32.07 B: (( )) 

40.55 50.63 B: well i um when i signed up for the study i read over some of the questions and one of it uh one that was the hypothetical situation that you would be offered um um 

50.81 53.69 B: a million dollars to leave the united states and never return 

54.45 54.93 A: hm 

55.27 56.54 B: and um 

56.94 59.94 B: i remember thinking about that before and 

66.79 70.10 B: um i think you know know what they didn't specify is being able to 

70.20 74.09 B: you don't to take someone with you now if it if hypothetically i 

71.80 72.30 A: hm mhm 

80.17 81.41 B: as individuals 

81.54 83.56 B: meaning that i couldn't take my husband or kid 

83.83 85.23 B: or anything with me 

85.34 87.13 B: um i wouldn't want to do that 

87.91 98.09 B: i wouldn't want to do that because you would have this million dollars but you wouldn't be able to share it with anybody that uh was important to you so it would just be you and your million dollars 

98.11 101.35 A: well i have no children and i'm not married 

101.44 102.23 A: but i have 

102.54 106.00 A: seven brothers and sisters so i would miss them 

103.92 104.31 B: hm mhm 

106.22 109.74 A: um my also way of thinking is 

110.30 111.25 A: a million dollars 

111.50 113.24 A: doesn't last that long 

112.81 115.02 B: hm mhm no not unless you're smart 

113.94 114.22 A: and 

115.22 116.13 A: yeah so 

115.68 116.89 B: and investing 

116.78 121.92 A: you'd have to really i mean you couldn't just go out and party and live really well 

122.10 125.19 A: and then uh oh you have no place to go 

125.19 125.69 B: hm mhm 

125.83 130.19 A: if i were going to go somewhere i would already know i'd go to new zealand 

131.71 132.14 A: but 

132.55 136.47 A: i don't think that i would go just for a million dollars and never 

136.64 138.11 A: be able to return 

139.35 143.82 B: i to me there's there's not enough i mean i'm i'm really fair family oriented 

144.47 148.19 B: and even um i was just t- speaking with you a minute ago about 

148.34 155.19 B: us talking about leaving michigan because it's so cold and i woke up thinking this morning uh cause i have two grown children 

166.27 169.95 B: uh like i do now so that even makes it hard to move 

170.07 173.33 B: to a warmer climate let alone leave the united states 

174.05 180.13 B: and um not ever be able to return at least we could make um plans to to visit each other 

180.23 181.85 B: during holidays or whatever 

182.25 184.79 B: just because i'm moving to a warmer climate 

185.03 187.08 B: but um that wouldn't be the case if i left the 

188.07 188.43 B: good 

189.09 190.82 A: and see if they would make it so you 

190.96 194.80 A: couldn't live in the united states again if you could visit 

195.56 202.85 A: then i'd be more likely to do that because i did pick up last year and move from west virginia and that's where all of my family is 

203.30 204.01 B: hm 

203.74 207.08 A: and move to atlanta where there's none of my family 

207.15 207.70 B: hm mhm 

207.78 208.70 A: and but you know i 

208.97 213.34 A: drive back up and i visit and so if it was just something where 

209.94 210.40 B: right 

214.92 215.28 A: couldn't 

215.37 222.21 A: you know stay as a residence like if you needed a green card and you could only stay a certain amount of time to visit than i would be i would be interested in doing it 

219.52 219.99 B: right 

222.31 222.62 A: but 

223.13 225.75 A: not when you can never ever come back 

240.71 243.73 B: none of that is worth anything if i can't 

244.55 245.64 B: be with my family 

245.78 249.04 B: and if i couldn't come back here again i don't i don't think it's worth that 

245.81 246.36 A: hm mhm 

249.94 252.07 B: at all um 

253.19 253.99 B: i don't 

257.09 263.40 B: i don't like being anywhere i guess that i c- especially if it's home um being told that i have to leave there and not 

263.69 264.82 B: ever come back again 

265.42 265.90 A: hm mhm 

265.46 265.94 B: um 

266.04 273.13 B: even if i had intentions of never coming back what changes is when someone tells me that i can't come back (( )) 

269.11 269.59 A: yeah 

273.44 275.79 B: puts a whole different spin on it for me 

275.57 275.83 A: that 

275.93 276.50 A: true 

276.73 277.59 B: um 

277.89 279.92 B: well that just reminded me of a uh 

280.48 281.80 B: like going on a diet 

282.27 283.16 B: um i 

283.88 288.14 B: when i'm told that there certain foods that i can't eat that's those are the ones that i want the most 

288.19 288.81 A: hm mhm 

288.23 288.62 B: so 

289.47 290.37 B: um that's 

290.49 293.69 B: the same thing for me so i i don't um 

295.68 296.95 B: that wouldn't set well with me 

297.81 301.53 A: well see if it was more money because they didn't specify that you couldn't 

302.06 303.26 A: take somebody with you 

303.32 303.77 B: hm mhm 

303.76 308.21 A: than if i had enough money 'til i could bring everybody i wanted to bring with me 

308.72 313.90 A: then i would be more an you know i'll try that i'll go cause new zealand is really pretty and 

311.31 311.92 B: yeah 

314.22 315.14 A: and i 

315.37 318.83 A: would like to go there and that would be a really good reason to go 

318.64 319.16 B: hm mhm 

319.07 324.86 A: but one million dollars wouldn't bring everybody over there's seven brothers and sisters and the nieces and nephews and 

324.69 325.27 B: right 

337.90 338.64 B: um even 

339.12 341.05 B: um some of the southern states 

341.67 343.27 B: but the fact that my children 

349.86 351.35 B: we don't want to live down south well 

351.45 355.61 B: that would be the same thing if you were leaving the united states you're going to have some family members 

355.87 360.04 B: who like where they who like what they're doing and they're not 

357.30 357.85 A: hm mhm 

360.56 362.75 B: necessarily going to want to pick up and leave 

363.12 364.82 B: you know because it's a decision that 

365.22 372.34 B: that i made and so then that again would make it hard um to move so far away not be able to come back 

372.57 375.70 B: and not have everybody that you want to go with you go 

376.96 382.51 A: i'm pretty sure that my some people i wanted to go if i had a lot of money would at least come and visit 

383.18 390.46 A: they'd be like sure i'll come over they'd be i couldn't get rid of 'em then they'd just come and live in my house and 

397.60 400.86 B: you'd probably end up taking some people that you didn't invite 

400.40 404.23 A: yeah well i wouldn't take them i just say no i'm sorry 

405.00 409.47 A: it's it's one of the exceptions i can take only this and this and this i can't take anybody 

409.59 410.02 A: else 

410.28 411.31 B: that's true 

411.97 421.78 B: and then you have people that are attached to um i'm attached to my family obviously you've heard that a million times already well you have people that are attached to their pets 

422.55 424.16 B: and um 

424.46 431.80 B: it just becomes a much bigger thing like even in our conversation i mean it was it was i guess it started out as a simple question 

432.14 437.40 B: if you were offered a million dollars to leave the united states and not be able to come back would you do that 

437.81 439.91 B: and even our thinking has filtered up 

440.06 443.54 B: bunch of other stuff in there so then imagine the people that 

444.05 445.12 B: you want to take 

445.26 453.41 B: the ones that you really want to take and you want them to go well think about the people that they'd think about that they want to take and then those people you know so it becomes a big 

450.97 451.87 A: yeah 

453.53 455.59 B: mess after a while 

455.94 457.94 A: that's why i'd have a lot of money 

458.24 460.28 B: yeah and and um and 

460.52 463.24 B: with the economy the way it is right now 

463.71 467.31 B: a million dollars isn't a lot and a million dollars here 

465.43 465.97 A: mhm mhm 

467.40 471.26 B: is probably a lot more than a million dollars somewhere else so then that's even less 

471.59 473.13 A: depending on where you go 

472.96 473.41 B: right 

474.41 475.55 B: right so 

484.03 491.05 B: briefly not in in detail but i remember when i read this particular one i did not um 

491.26 492.92 B: it didn't it wasn't something that 

493.27 495.44 B: i wished would happen to me 

495.55 496.31 B: um because 

496.59 498.94 B: the question was written and and and it did 

499.11 504.69 B: um i did perceive it to mean that it would mean only me not being able to take anyone else 

504.49 504.80 A: hm 

504.82 512.66 B: um and i might have a read a little more into it but i also looked it as saying that i wouldn't even really have any contact with people back here but that's me i have a very 

512.97 514.07 B: wild imagination 

514.73 520.84 B: i started thinking about oh my god i'd leave my family and i wouldn't be able to come back and they wouldn't be able to come visit me and 

521.06 522.54 B: and um 

522.33 523.48 A: can't call 'em 

524.04 524.75 B: yeah just 

524.52 525.44 A: can't write them 

525.51 527.80 B: yeah and and people have a tendencies 

527.90 535.45 B: to think that a million dollars is a lot so you know you might have to jump through those types of hoop if someone offered you something like that
