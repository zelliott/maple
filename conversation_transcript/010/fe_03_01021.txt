87.19 88.47 A: (( [laughter] i we- i ))

94.56 95.68 B: (( [laughter] mhm ))

129.04 130.25 A: mhm 

129.21 131.00 B: in the united states 

131.24 137.31 B: and that is concern even though they have deployed just about everybody from fairchild [laughter] 

136.98 149.46 A: mhm yeah we have um macquire [laughter] and ah earl naval weapons station and yes we have our share of military establishment also so [laughter] 

139.84 141.07 B: mhm 

148.83 150.72 B: as far as what 

152.16 155.89 B: i don't feel threatened by terrorism 

155.57 156.87 A: mhm 

156.22 170.71 B: but i talk i've talked to some people who have um protected their houses i i've talked to some people who have set up one safe room in their house so in case there is a terroristic you know um 

166.55 167.70 A: mhm 

170.78 172.53 B: attack that um 

171.51 172.69 A: mhm 

172.88 174.64 A: have you brought your duct tape 

174.31 182.65 B: mhm yeah they have in fact i know one couple who have one room completely set up and complete so they could live in it for weeks 

175.05 175.63 A: (( [laughter] )) 

182.02 183.02 A: (( ahah )) 

182.95 185.85 B: and and it's secure everything 

184.81 185.99 A: mhm 

186.17 191.76 B: they they are thinking it would be safe you know for any kind of um airborne 

191.59 194.44 A: yeah have have you taken any precautions 

193.84 198.88 B: no i haven't i have not my only thought has been if 

195.03 196.09 A: mhm 

199.19 200.07 B: (( if )) 

200.29 207.17 B: something happens up at fairchild the airforce base which is fifteen miles from my house 

203.04 204.20 A: mhm 

206.64 208.18 A: yeah uhuh 

207.22 213.75 B: my f- my family all live up by the canadian border in idaho which is a hundred miles away 

213.33 214.68 A: mhm 

214.33 220.97 B: so if we had trouble with our water or anything i would go up there that's the only plan i have in my head 

220.54 221.57 A: (( uhuh )) 

222.33 223.28 B: um 

223.33 232.61 B: i i from watching what i see in the stores i think some people have went overboard for fear of terrorism 

226.92 228.07 A: mhm 

233.07 235.77 A: well i think people went through it ah 

235.80 243.70 A: when it turned two thousand also [laughter] so they knew the drill [laughter] you know you get your water and your can opener and your and your soup 

237.88 239.19 B: [laughter] this is 

241.21 242.79 B: mhm 

243.88 246.53 B: i didn't do anything about that either i didn't 

246.94 248.37 B: and 

247.56 254.12 A: is that because i don't are you really fatalistic about it or you just feel that you could deal with it if it if it happened 

253.41 266.93 B: i would deal with it i'm i'm a person that can pretty well handle anything at the time i might fall apart afterwards but during the time i can handle just about anything and i i would be one of the people that would be calm and rational 

254.93 256.07 A: mhm 

259.93 261.38 A: right 

262.95 264.50 A: yeah 

266.65 269.85 A: [laughter] yeah i would obviously because of 

270.30 273.28 A: our proximity to new york here we w- we were 

273.31 275.93 A: pretty shaken by what happened ah 

276.61 283.01 A: on september eleventh we happened to be in pennsylvania at one of the state parks out in the woods and didn't realize what had happened until 

283.05 287.48 A: nearly noon when we came out and the park offices and everything were closed 

287.64 288.68 B: mhm 

287.76 298.43 A: and then when we came back here i looked out across the bay there was just you know smoke where the buildings had been and of course my husband and grandchildren has been up to the top of the world trade center 

299.02 302.26 A: and i i i think it kind of did affect or 

302.32 304.39 A: made us feel much more vulnerable 

305.34 309.52 B: i i think that's what they planned on the terrorists 

309.00 309.93 A: right 

309.93 313.02 B: because we have always been pretty secure 

313.37 315.30 A: yes absolutely 

313.51 314.38 B: you know 

314.73 318.98 B: we have been secure we you know we've got good armed forces we've 

316.71 317.89 A: mhm 

319.25 327.06 B: good security systems you know everywhere from the top of the line all the way down to the little towns and whatever 

321.24 322.47 A: mhm 

327.26 328.43 A: yeah 

327.76 336.05 B: you know they've protected us well and and we here other than of course back in you know 

336.40 340.35 B: before when they were all the states and stuff we've never been invaded 

340.21 341.15 A: right 

340.93 344.39 B: we we have never been invaded we have we have never 

344.67 346.54 B: we've had the 

347.49 356.42 B: locals who have done horrible things like the federal building and things like that but we've never had to live in fear before 

351.29 352.51 A: yeah 

353.02 354.09 A: right 

356.06 366.80 A: yeah and we can't we kinda can't get away from it because it's like every every town here has at least one memorial a memorial garden so it's like everywhere you go you're 

366.99 375.75 A: you're reminded of it and then of course you know for months and months after the attacks there were obituaries in our local paper for the trade center victims 

375.12 377.24 B: right oh yeah 

375.89 377.41 A: (( so that ah )) 

377.73 386.08 A: i i i think that i feel i don't know if i'd be [laughter] i'll probably be less calm if something happened now that i would have been before that 

386.50 387.44 B: because 

386.71 387.84 A: but if but if 

388.18 392.43 B: because now we can know what can happen 

392.07 393.23 A: right 

392.60 394.61 B: and we never thought of it before 

394.11 395.21 A: right 

395.26 401.37 A: but about the only precautions we're taking is i i did put together a a small emergency kit 

401.00 401.96 B: mhm 

401.66 408.61 A: with um you know the usual flashlight and some some some money for phone calls [laughter] and 

409.05 410.87 A: some clean underwear 

410.12 413.93 B: [laughter] oh yeah the necessaries yes 

414.67 421.01 A: but i figure well that's also useful in the event of a you know a hurricane or whatever 

421.54 423.37 B: (( right yeah )) 

421.62 423.50 A: [laughter] [mn] 

423.60 436.56 A: the most peculiar thing we've been through is when we had lived in pennsylvania before we moved here and we had a four point six earthquake we were about a mile from the epicenter so that kind of shook us also [laughter] it's just ah 

423.60 424.46 B: it's the 

433.67 436.10 B: oh really ooh 

436.69 440.74 A: when the unexpected happens like that [laughter] 

438.05 439.72 B: [laughter] 

440.42 445.50 B: we where we are here we're kind of immune to those kind of things you know um 

445.00 446.39 A: (( yeah )) 

445.76 458.27 B: we we've had minor earthquakes like two point six i think like three years ago we had one but but where we are we don't have hurricanes we don't have tornadoes 

449.41 450.53 A: mhm 

451.81 453.75 A: yeah 

457.54 458.70 A: mhm 

458.54 459.47 B: um 

459.52 462.14 B: we don't have extreme weather um 

461.64 462.84 A: yeah 

462.16 464.95 B: i've lived here in spokan for 

465.29 468.56 B: fourteen years and the weather has never got 

466.73 467.72 A: (( [laughter] )) 

468.99 477.17 B: i think one time it got eleven below but the rest of the time it's been above zero so we don't have the extreme cold we don't have the extreme heat so 

476.46 477.72 A: mhm 

477.65 484.89 B: um there is flooding but not that it affects any place close to where i live i live within the city limits 

483.10 484.06 A: right 

484.44 485.46 A: uh-huh 

485.69 487.65 B: and so um 

488.94 495.70 B: i'm i guess i take things pretty much for granted and and when i went down to the courthouse 

491.68 492.82 A: yeah 

495.98 497.81 B: oh two weeks ago 

498.80 500.24 B: (( i )) 

500.58 501.39 B: felt 

502.85 509.21 B: a little funny about my purse had to go through you know the scanner then i had to go through and 

506.45 508.04 A: right uh-huh ooh 

509.36 520.01 B: and there was something that must have two pens laying together or something in my purse and and so they pulled my purse and asked me to step aside and i was like 

514.41 516.10 A: (( uh-huh )) 

518.68 520.01 A: right 

520.46 524.31 B: it's just a courthouse you know [laughter] 

522.26 523.91 A: mhm 

524.13 529.80 A: well before before we had moved here i had worked for a judge in in a courthouse in pennsylvania 

530.20 534.89 A: and you you do get death threats you know you do get bomb threats 

532.42 533.43 B: mhm 

534.96 541.70 A: and somehow there i was much more able to take it in stride it was just kind of you know part of the job [laughter] in a way 

540.36 541.67 B: right 

541.71 542.73 A: and i 

543.50 546.48 A: i i didn't ever really let it get to me 

546.07 546.98 B: mhm 

546.89 560.31 A: although once i remember a court administrator walking in and saying we we have bomb threat would you look around the office and i'm thinking i could look in the file cabinet under e. for explosive or b. for bomb or what [laughter] 

555.42 560.29 B: [laughter] uh-huh 

560.11 566.70 A: but that somehow i ah i guess now i just feel more vulnerable than i did then [laughter] 

565.62 567.36 B: i i think the one 

566.77 570.85 A: but i will have clean underwear [laughter] 

568.22 573.74 B: oh yeah [laughter] the one thing that bothers me is 

574.23 577.00 B: the people we are dealing with now 

577.01 580.94 B: have no respect for human life 

580.79 581.78 A: yes 

581.50 583.14 B: that bothers me 

583.30 584.28 B: um 

584.64 587.15 B: if we go back to the trade center 

587.63 588.88 B: and 

588.92 590.15 B: those 

590.21 596.49 B: people piloting those planes that took over the planes knew they were going to die 

596.32 597.61 A: mhm 

596.94 598.08 B: and 

598.38 599.74 B: and
