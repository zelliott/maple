37.71 39.67 A: anyway i guess we are supposed to talk about comedy 

37.89 38.47 B: oh 

39.82 42.80 B: and yeah regarding some of these um 

43.61 45.07 B: where we draw the line 

45.24 45.88 B: um 

49.38 50.01 B: oh 

49.43 53.31 A: not necessarily a comedy but that is about as in bad taste as i've ever seen 

53.51 56.34 B: yeah yes i agree they're just 

56.98 58.68 B: they're so over 

59.07 59.59 B: hype 

59.69 60.20 B: and 

60.79 63.59 B: i mean they're not even i mean it's not even funny

64.06 66.39 B: i don't i don't know what what the point of all these 

65.40 69.32 A: and they play laugh tracks with it or the audience or whoever is laughing 
69.43 70.59 B: right 

69.77 71.68 A: but it's repulsive 

72.00 74.30 B: right i know

79.09 81.61 A: oh that's awful too 

80.26 82.52 B: now that is bad that 

82.09 84.96 A: now that movie was supposed to have been rated really well 

85.45 86.70 A: i don't know who watched it 

85.52 86.33 B: oh really 

87.11 87.90 B: i don't know 

88.10 94.88 B: i don't know i i watched it a couple times and it was just so disgusting i i couldn't watch it anymore i mean it was just so ridiculous 

94.33 94.77 A: well 

94.99 97.60 A: the one i saw was the man got in a port a potty 

97.91 100.63 A: and then they dumped the port a potty upside down on him 

100.79 102.20 B: oh my god 

102.14 106.39 A: n- now i come from a safety background first off not safe at 

105.24 105.95 B: mhm 

106.51 108.06 A: at all and second off 

108.18 109.81 A: all the stuff that was in there 

110.05 111.58 A: and they thought it was hilarious 

110.19 110.75 B: mhm 

112.24 113.88 B: oh my god i 

113.27 115.58 A: or when they were shooting each other with those (( )) guns

127.83 128.26 B: but 

128.61 130.22 B: know yeah it is 

130.58 132.24 B: and then as far as like some of these 

133.16 133.81 B: um 

134.09 141.19 B: comedians that use fowl language and that's kind of inappropriate i don't know if you have kids but i do i have a daughter and 

139.30 140.29 A: i don't know 

141.56 143.69 B: uh i mean i just have to be careful what i 

143.78 145.53 B: have on the t._v. because if 

143.96 144.63 A: oh yeah 

146.27 147.90 B: she'll pick up anything 

148.52 156.22 A: i can hear her in the background no i don't have any kids it's not so much the language now some of the things they talk about with women is offensive 

149.30 149.85 B: yes 

150.91 151.20 B: yeah 

156.53 157.26 B: mhm 

157.13 159.16 A: you know and they start calling us all kinds of 

159.80 163.60 A: slang words or using slang words for parts of anatomy now that's offensive 

163.75 164.84 B: yes yeah 

164.61 170.05 A: but somebody must get a laugh out of it or they would have stopped it a long time ago 

169.01 169.82 B: mhm 

169.95 170.51 B: mhm 

171.19 172.49 B: yes and 

173.15 174.47 A: and reality t._v. 

173.35 173.72 B: um 

174.77 178.47 A: i don't know what the interest is there whether it's supposed to be a comedy or what but 

178.96 182.50 A: you can't turn on the t._v. anymore without something being a reality show 
182.13 183.01 B: i know i 

183.60 192.26 B: i yeah i really (( and )) now that i think about it i really don't watch much t._v. except for you know my husband he watches like sports and the basketball games and stuff like that 

192.55 193.95 B: that we really don't watch 

194.14 195.90 B: very much t._v. -cause it's not
