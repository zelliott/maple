32.27 33.55 B: i think that uh 

36.26 37.68 B: everybody is in a panic 

39.31 40.77 B: but if we just keep our head 

41.21 42.27 B: i think things will 

43.02 43.52 B: you know 

44.52 45.49 B: be kept calm 

45.81 47.95 B: and that's my you know that's my philosophy 

48.35 48.74 B: for 

48.90 49.90 B: that particular subject 

52.14 52.45 A: yeah 

54.98 57.74 A: yeah i guess i'm not sure what would happen i guess i think everyone 

58.41 60.45 A: if it was a mass group of people everyone would panic 

63.58 67.57 A: there would just be so much or or everyone would be trying to get out and save themselves but it would just 

70.11 72.73 A: cause a mass chaos and cause everyone to be killed 

73.27 73.99 B: exactly 

73.30 74.12 A: how do you think you would re- 

74.44 75.51 A: how do you think you would react to it 

76.24 76.69 B: yeah 

77.06 77.47 B: well 

77.59 78.78 B: i think i would 

80.64 81.34 B: be calm 

82.05 83.33 B: because i do have children 

84.77 85.38 B: um 

85.53 87.17 B: i wouldn't want to panic because of 

87.65 89.16 B: of the children because they don't 

89.45 90.83 B: really know what's going on 

91.75 92.75 B: you know like us adults 

95.42 96.83 B: but i would also be 

99.02 99.66 B: frightful and 

101.20 101.95 B: because our 

102.61 103.31 B: united states 

103.75 104.58 B: military 

106.05 107.11 B: is not equipped 

108.03 108.28 B: with 

109.80 111.17 B: the gear they're suppose to have 

113.62 114.29 B: they're not 

116.09 116.97 B: prepared to 

117.58 118.26 B: go to war 

126.41 127.33 B: what do you think about that 

129.25 129.62 A: um 

130.48 132.03 A: i guess i'm not really sure like i wouldn't 

132.56 134.77 A: i guess i wouldn't try to make a guess about if our 

134.97 136.06 A: government was really ready 

136.20 137.26 A: or not to take on 

137.46 138.54 A: something like that because 

139.50 140.64 A: i mean i don't know 

140.86 141.71 A: and i wouldn't want to 

142.72 143.54 A: talk down on 

143.65 146.71 A: the government if they you know because there could be there's a whole lot to more that 

147.08 149.51 A: whole lot more to it than i that i don't understand 

150.70 152.62 B: well the only reason why i stated 

150.72 151.05 A: so 

152.98 154.50 B: those words is because 

155.22 156.06 B: i read 

156.26 156.70 B: you know 

156.96 158.63 B: like the news is suppose to be 

159.11 161.34 B: something that we can rely on that is true 

162.97 163.94 B: and that is letting 

164.49 165.23 B: the public 

165.66 166.94 B: and society know 

167.60 168.95 B: what we're really facing 

169.46 171.22 B: and when i read those words 

171.63 172.63 B: that we were not 

172.83 174.35 B: as you know we as 

174.64 177.40 B: the united states as a country as one 

177.80 179.09 B: were not equipped 

179.53 180.56 B: with the proper 

181.21 181.79 B: gear 

182.76 183.96 B: for war 

184.42 185.49 B: i was devastated 

186.37 186.82 B: because if 

187.20 188.26 B: some of the masks 

188.61 189.69 B: have holes in them 

190.53 191.46 B: and if some of the 

191.91 192.38 B: uh 

193.98 194.43 B: you know 

195.30 197.01 B: i guess shoulder pads or whatever 

197.28 198.24 B: are not really 

198.81 199.94 B: suitable for war 

200.60 201.89 B: they don't have a fighting chance 

203.35 204.85 B: and i read these words 

203.60 203.89 A: yeah 

206.46 207.45 B: so what do you think about that 

209.34 209.72 A: um 

210.52 212.21 A: yeah i would agree i i haven't read or 

213.15 214.97 A: or seen anything on the news like that but i don't 

215.07 216.36 A: watch the news a whole lot 

217.03 217.40 A: so 

218.53 218.85 A: ach 

220.92 222.76 A: i guess i'm still just not really sure 

223.87 224.27 A: um 

225.19 226.31 A: i i guess i i would 

227.29 230.74 A: i would more than hope that we would be ready i would almost expect that we'd be ready 

231.49 234.18 A: based on how long we've been really thinking about this and everything 

235.04 235.43 A: um 

236.39 238.93 A: plus all of our tax dollars going into it i would just uh 

239.41 239.80 B: yes 

240.18 240.67 A: assume 

241.38 244.47 A: i would assume and e- expect that they would be ready to take on 

245.30 245.79 A: that's uh 

246.45 247.79 A: pretty much their job 

248.15 250.39 B: yeah and i can respect what you just said because 

250.84 252.09 B: united states is 

252.45 253.10 B: one 

253.65 254.69 B: you know in its own 

254.93 256.23 B: we're going to stand up and fight 

256.68 257.77 B: for our country 

260.42 260.77 B: and 

261.13 262.69 B: you know when i look outside 

263.14 264.93 B: and i take my kids to school 

265.35 269.43 B: and you know i do my everyday chores and and things that i need to do as 

269.79 271.38 B: a parent in society 

271.72 272.69 B: you know i think about 

272.91 273.73 B: our president 

273.95 274.31 B: (( i'm like )) 

274.51 276.12 B: well it's our president's duty 

276.27 277.43 B: capable of doing 

277.62 278.19 B: what he needs 

279.49 281.35 B: no i'm not going to answer that yes or nay 

282.26 282.62 B: but 

283.86 284.43 B: when 

284.93 285.69 B: clinton 

285.90 286.83 B: was president 

287.17 288.25 B: we didn't go to war 

291.16 292.25 B: so what do you think about that 

294.13 294.56 A: um 

296.66 297.37 A: again i 

298.75 301.37 A: i don't think i'm qualified to give a real answer to it 

302.42 306.31 A: now i i'm not sure if the president would be ready to really take on something like that 

310.77 312.66 A: i guess i don't know really when you 

312.99 318.67 A: when you would actually say that you are you know when you can really get enough weapons and everything and just say oh i'm ready to 

319.06 320.05 A: now we're ready to go 

320.66 320.99 A: (( )) 

323.17 324.32 A: (( )) 

324.48 326.48 A: is good enough really ever good enough or you're 

332.60 335.60 A: (( uh )) how do you think we would face a uh terrorist attack here in the 

336.44 340.51 A: (( home )) grounds like if someone had like a bomb or something do you think we're ready to take on that kind of stuff 

340.70 341.19 A: or like uh 

341.99 343.15 A: like a biological weapon 

343.34 345.86 A: like in a big city you think we're ready to take on that kind of thing 

346.60 348.04 B: well i think if everybody 

348.82 350.66 B: that was doing their homework 

351.25 352.59 B: knew what to do 

353.00 353.86 B: to prepare 

354.71 355.88 B: uh in these attacks 

356.34 357.31 B: you know if they really 

357.73 358.53 B: did their homework 

359.51 363.08 B: and they knew how to prepare their families for this particular attack 

363.48 365.26 B: i think everything would be okay 

365.64 367.31 B: but if they were unknowledgeable 

367.68 368.61 B: uneducated 

368.84 369.97 B: and not keeping up with 

370.43 372.02 B: certain aspects of the news 

372.55 373.23 B: and certain 

373.63 376.17 B: things of uh uh just a part uh uh of 

377.27 377.99 B: common sense 

378.45 379.23 B: they would not 

379.53 380.48 B: know what to do 

381.15 381.55 B: so 

381.89 383.70 B: if you draw a line in the middle 

385.40 387.75 B: in the middle of our population of the united states 

389.31 390.22 B: i would say 

393.16 393.98 B: about may- 

394.80 395.80 B: thirty percent 

396.69 397.89 B: survival because 

399.71 402.86 B: the other part of that percentage which would be seventy percent 

403.43 404.30 B: would not 

405.91 406.55 B: would not 

406.93 407.33 B: know 

408.57 409.34 B: because they're 

410.61 411.14 B: i mean they're 

413.81 414.76 B: they don't know 

416.33 416.83 B: they're not 

418.22 419.49 B: reading and and 

419.88 421.43 B: and educated and and 

422.09 425.48 B: and trying to know what's going on in the world surround them 

425.87 426.63 B: because they don't 

428.53 429.36 B: they don't have that 

429.53 430.36 B: mentality 

431.83 432.75 B: they weren't taught 

435.68 436.71 A: i guess like in terms of 

435.98 436.49 B: so 

438.40 441.37 A: i guess in terms of preparing yourself for what might happen i guess 

441.82 445.16 A: i don't see (( )) everyone can really even 

445.60 448.31 A: prepare for some kind of biological weapon because you can't 

449.44 450.41 A: people don't have the 

450.53 451.54 A: the money or the 

451.76 454.55 A: anything to prepare for something like that (( )) pretty much 

455.21 456.31 A: you we're in the hands of 

456.63 459.04 A: (( we're protected especially in this case is the government and )) 

459.43 461.12 A: i guess if there's a bomb or something i guess 

462.24 463.85 A: or something like that i wouldn't know how 

464.68 467.14 A: i wouldn't see how it would even be possible for people to be fully 

467.73 470.75 A: prepared even if they knew what to do or knew how to do it it's just 

471.36 473.08 A: i don't know if people could even do it 

473.64 474.15 B: yeah 

473.95 475.30 A: whatever they need to do at the time 

475.76 476.19 B: yeah 

476.71 478.48 B: and i can respect your point of view too 

482.68 483.29 A: but the 

511.55 512.94 B: the fundamentals of life 

513.16 513.94 B: you know as far as 

514.79 516.43 B: uh the mannerism 

517.07 517.92 B: and uh 

519.07 519.52 B: i guess 

520.50 521.55 B: respecting 

526.81 528.22 B: (( )) of our country 

529.09 530.91 B: that have not had those skills 

531.27 532.06 B: from birth 

532.66 533.90 B: are not going to know what 

535.64 536.92 A: yeah that that definitely is a point (( of )) 

537.02 539.16 A: ignorance to society eh some people 

538.60 539.18 B: mhm 

539.83 540.40 A: some people don't 

540.57 541.40 A: don't know or else 

541.56 542.34 A: don't care or 

541.87 543.47 B: exactly exactly 

543.18 543.53 A: (( )) 

543.82 544.61 A: (( the boss but ))
