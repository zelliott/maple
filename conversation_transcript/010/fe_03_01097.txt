8.88 11.38 A: so what do you think you would do 

11.27 14.14 B: um i don't know that's tough i really uh 

15.06 16.39 B: i don't think i'd like to leave 

17.37 18.06 A: well 

18.55 21.96 A: i don't think i'd really like to to leave either but right now i'm not 

22.06 22.75 A: feeling very 

23.22 25.32 A: secure after september the eleventh 

25.72 26.90 B: that's an interesting point 

27.26 28.04 B: that is true 

28.58 29.56 A: i think um 

30.23 32.24 A: i think i'd probably just like to go to canada 

32.73 33.72 B: oh that's interesting 

34.28 35.73 A: because it's not that far away 

36.69 36.98 B: right 

36.69 38.75 A: then i we wouldn't be able to come back 

38.93 41.14 B: right (( )) that that part bothers me 

41.22 41.85 A: yeah 

42.03 42.55 B: that you 

43.09 46.10 B: couldn't even come back and they don't say if you could come to visit even at least 

46.24 46.82 A: mhm 

46.97 48.64 A: but i guess your family could come to you 

47.04 47.39 B: uh 

49.62 50.11 B: that's true 

50.24 52.82 B: i don't know it doesn't get you a as far as it use to 

52.74 53.75 A: yeah that's true 

54.97 58.33 B: so i i think it might need to be more if i was going to be willing to do it 

58.31 58.77 A: yeah 

59.04 60.31 A: you r- you got a point there 

60.56 62.10 B: i need to be set for life 

62.12 63.28 A: right exactly 

65.10 67.13 B: but uh uh it's interesting i'm not really sure 

69.35 73.06 A: yeah something to really think about but i guess a lot of people would if they had to 

73.19 74.71 A: it's just like when they had um 

75.41 76.46 A: was it the um 

77.76 80.51 A: but which war was it where the a lot of the fellows um 

81.20 82.07 A: went to canada 

83.20 84.42 A: was it the vietnam war 

83.46 83.81 B: oh 

84.05 85.10 B: vietnam yeah 

84.91 85.29 A: yeah 

85.59 86.83 B: yeah a lot of draft dodgers 

86.48 87.71 A: and they can't come back right 

88.26 89.01 A: i don't think so 

89.41 91.54 B: um i think there was penalties 

91.69 92.09 A: yeah 

92.13 94.16 B: uh i th- think they could have been thrown in jail 

94.16 94.66 A: mhm 

96.29 97.64 B: i mean it's unappealing 

97.88 98.43 A: true 

98.67 100.62 A: but i guess their families can come to visit them 

101.37 101.72 B: right 

102.19 104.95 B: or if they came to face the music if they if they did their time 

105.43 108.74 A: no i don't th- i don't think i want a coun- 

106.77 107.53 B: i don't know 

108.93 110.41 A: i think i just stay up there 

110.97 111.43 B: yeah 

111.58 112.78 B: it it's very possible 

112.90 113.34 A: yeah 

113.20 115.05 B: although you know it's got to be a strain to 

116.36 117.82 B: feel like your living outside the law 

120.91 121.48 A: no 

124.81 125.36 A: hm um 

126.01 126.26 B: but 

126.62 129.49 B: again i i think the bottom line is as much as it would be tempting 

130.52 131.12 B: um 

133.00 134.21 B: if i if i wasn't sure if 

134.60 136.58 B: if they had given me the option that i could come back like 

137.14 138.63 B: at least in five years or something 

138.68 139.18 A: mhm 

139.18 140.15 B: then maybe i'd do it 

140.54 141.27 B: you know after 

140.55 141.50 A: yeah but they don't 

141.61 142.41 B: yeah uh 

141.71 144.70 A: they just say in that they give you a million and that's it 

145.13 146.47 B: yeah i don't think it's enough 

146.65 152.43 A: hm um if it doesn't go very not well even without even if they didn't take out any taxes ah you don't know how long it would last 

152.56 155.61 B: right you know if it was something like ten million you know 

155.01 155.49 A: yeah 

156.13 157.99 B: and i'd i'd probably have a better shot 

158.25 158.91 A: that's true 

159.02 161.29 B: uh i i would probably consider it 

161.41 162.65 B: but ten million i can also 

162.78 164.84 B: take my whole family if they wanted to come 

165.15 169.13 A: but the way i think the question is put that uh just you by yourself i think 

169.85 170.41 B: right 

170.61 171.10 B: well 

171.73 173.48 B: they didn't say that you can't take somebody with you 

173.54 174.28 A: that's true 

179.17 180.77 A: that's true it was 

181.59 182.18 B: uh 

182.56 186.50 A: but i think the furthest i would like to go would be canada because it's not really too far 

187.20 187.52 B: right 

188.42 189.88 A: you don't want to go too far away 

190.27 190.73 B: no 

191.15 194.02 B: yes it is it is interesting i'm real not really sure 

194.98 195.77 B: uh 

196.94 197.84 B: i might go to israel 

198.60 199.21 A: oh really 

199.87 200.46 B: uh 

200.71 202.07 B: yeah even though it's just 

203.47 205.95 B: as bad or if worse shape than we are right now uh 

205.45 206.07 A: mhm 

206.76 209.24 B: there there are some ties i have a little bit of family there 

209.42 210.04 A: oh you do 

210.76 211.44 A: oh 

215.35 216.73 A: yeah probably yeah 

218.94 220.85 B: it's very pretty i've also been there it's also very nice 

220.77 222.82 A: have you been th- have you been to jerusalem 

223.03 223.32 B: yeah 

223.60 224.20 A: oh really 

225.47 228.77 B: it's an amazing feeling it's just absolutely steeped i history 

229.05 229.68 A: wow 

229.97 232.87 B: i mean eh when you walk the streets there and you see everything 

233.15 233.65 A: mhm 

233.15 233.72 B: um 

234.24 234.91 B: from from 

235.39 236.26 B: different religions 

236.51 237.03 A: mhm 

236.60 237.44 B: it it's just 

238.47 240.48 B: you realize how young america is 

240.69 241.19 A: really 

241.36 242.12 B: oh god yes 

242.80 244.70 B: feel like we're babies you know 

244.37 244.97 A: ew 

245.38 246.59 B: yeah it it's just 

246.78 249.55 B: i mean we think you know you're walking with your things that 

249.72 251.72 B: history that was you know thousands of years 

252.38 253.87 A: does it really look that old 

255.06 257.05 B: it's not so much that it looks old it's just 

257.20 260.14 B: you feel and and people know the history of you know 

260.70 262.64 B: you know whoever walked wherever 

262.69 263.13 A: right 

266.04 267.57 B: who walked where and did what when 

268.22 270.57 B: you realize you know that's really it's a very neat 

270.88 271.81 B: feeling its just 

271.15 272.13 A: wow that's great 

272.40 272.83 B: yeah 

273.05 275.04 B: it really is it really is amazing 

277.35 278.28 B: but nothing more than 

278.70 280.27 B: two three hundred years old 

280.07 281.35 A: yeah that's true 

281.38 284.60 B: you know that that's nothing compared to i mean i haven't really been to europe but 

289.71 291.26 A: i'm from florida and there's a place 

298.00 298.55 B: really 

299.98 300.80 B: that's interesting 

300.68 304.16 A: yeah i'd like to go see it and she said she went she said it's beautiful 

304.78 305.92 B: oh i've never even heard that 

306.05 306.54 A: mhm 

306.81 308.53 A: i think i don't know whether they built it 

308.77 310.88 A: must have been last year because it's relatively new 

312.74 315.35 A: can't get there i guess you can see a replica of it 

315.48 316.08 B: yeah right 

317.37 319.27 B: anybody any of us are doing these days 

319.31 319.83 A: yeah 

320.19 320.67 A: pretty much 

323.43 323.96 A: mhm 

326.18 327.65 B: have you ever done this before 

327.90 328.40 A: no 

328.85 329.95 B: so this is your first time 

329.98 333.08 A: yeah i had um they they had a topic um 

330.51 331.03 B: me too 

333.78 337.02 A: in the beginning of the week i didn't really want to talk about terrorism so 

337.27 337.90 B: oh 

338.27 341.47 A: i just left left that alone because it's scary enough as it is 

343.73 344.34 B: yeah i know it's just 

343.95 345.05 A: have you done it before 

344.97 347.37 B: no this is my first time (( too )) 

346.09 347.86 A: this your first time too 

348.30 349.57 B: i wonder if they do that on purpose 

350.28 350.93 A: i don't know 

352.38 355.07 B: so so you're as clueless as i am about what happens after 

355.10 355.68 A: mhm 

355.85 358.42 B: okay i guess we'll find out 

358.91 360.05 B: i don't know 

359.67 362.34 A: i thought it would be fun that's why you know i signed up for it 

362.49 363.62 B: yeah it's kind of cool 

363.60 364.29 A: yeah it is 

366.48 367.02 B: the idea 

367.85 369.81 B: oh i wonder what they'll find out about us 

370.19 371.77 A: i don't know 

372.24 374.18 B: well i don't know do they really care even what 

374.26 375.53 B: we're talking about as much as 

377.19 377.94 B: how we speak 

378.20 379.93 A: i think maybe they just want to 

380.09 384.62 A: probably get your views and opinions of you know what you would do in certain situations 

385.42 390.24 B: i mean i thought they were listening more to because i thought it was a linguistic study i thought they were listening more to how we 

391.24 391.89 A: i don't know 

392.19 393.85 A: definitely maybe 

394.21 394.83 B: i wonder 

397.38 397.84 A: it is 

398.18 401.79 B: but uh so wait a second so did we decide that we would take the money or no 

401.97 402.84 B: i don- i don't 

403.14 404.40 B: i don't think it's enough for me to 

405.53 406.41 B: give up everything 

406.59 407.18 A: hm um 

407.87 411.04 B: uh you sounded like you might consider going to cali- canada 

411.02 416.16 A: yeah because i figured it would be close i mean let's i mean eh if it was a situation where you 

416.48 417.14 A: had to go 

417.54 418.93 A: and you didn't have any alternative 

419.18 419.52 B: right 

420.42 422.44 A: then i think it would be canada because it's close 

422.98 423.35 B: right 

423.91 425.45 B: yeah but eh s- since this wasn't a 

425.80 426.55 B: have to 

426.98 427.46 A: yeah 

427.43 428.14 B: uh 

428.85 430.84 B: there's more would you if y- for a million 

433.70 436.53 A: hm um not nowadays because everything is all high 

438.46 440.64 A: canada might be more expensive than the united states 

443.61 444.13 B: eh isn't 

450.94 451.67 A: it could be 

451.62 452.13 B: wow 

453.83 456.89 A: but it's beautiful but it does stay cold for a long period of time 

458.55 459.20 B: i don't like cold 

460.70 462.24 B: my husband likes upstate new york and 

462.52 464.41 B: he knows i can't survive there 

463.97 464.96 A: yeah that's true 

466.31 467.33 B: definitely cold 

467.85 471.68 A: then i don't care for l- the heat too much either because florida is not my (( )) 

472.10 472.73 B: oh really 

473.28 475.60 A: no i only came down because my parents are down here 

475.94 477.24 A: because i'm originally form the north 

476.04 476.48 B: really 

477.74 478.20 B: where 

478.68 481.92 A: well originally i was born in new york but i grew up in new jersey 

481.98 483.50 B: oh you know i didn't say you know i'm in new york 

484.06 484.91 A: oh you're in new york 

484.64 486.43 B: yeah i just realized it 

486.75 487.71 B: huh i 

488.06 490.51 B: you said where you were i didn't say where i was 

491.03 492.27 B: uh yeah no i'm in new york 

493.76 494.46 B: born and raised 

496.30 499.97 B: oh so that's interesting so your from new jer- new york and new jersey so you know this area too 

500.19 500.71 A: mhm 

500.90 502.82 B: that's why canada doesn't seem too far a leap 

503.01 503.90 A: no it's not 

503.07 503.53 B: okay 

505.52 507.44 B: i have a lot of family here (( )) 

509.23 509.58 B: (( )) 

512.60 514.25 B: you know we sometimes talk about moving just
