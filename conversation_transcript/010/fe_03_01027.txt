82.84 83.66 A: yeah 

89.33 90.55 A: yes 

91.25 99.69 B: it's you know weird it's a totally another thing to put myself on a plane [laughter] and say let's go although i did go to new york over the holidays

102.66 105.30 B: well and you know what it was um 

105.70 108.06 B: it was very um 

108.63 115.04 B: it was very interesting to go and we saw where the the ah world trade center was and um 

113.05 113.99 A: uh-huh 

115.22 117.12 B: it did just make you think 

117.17 120.59 B: um gosh i can't imagine 

120.64 123.31 B: you know what it made me think is it made me think that 

121.67 122.58 A: yeah 

123.32 133.01 B: i can't believe that the people who were just you know walking down the stairs and just thinking this is probably a drill or you know something there's a fire in the building or something 

133.10 141.88 B: i'm sure they had no idea you know that er that the buildings weren't gonna be there any time in the near future as well as um 

133.83 134.39 A: (( [cough] )) 

141.91 143.02 B: i just 

143.07 144.81 B: i can't imagine 

145.38 148.70 B: i don't know i just can't imagine being stuck in such a small little place 

148.71 150.52 B: you know in a stairwell 

148.90 152.77 A: [noise] do you believe that there will be a terrorist attack you think 

153.23 154.57 B: [sigh] 

155.16 157.70 B: you know on the one hand i think to myself 

158.01 163.67 B: well you know there can't be everybody watching everything that you know the people who wanna harm us 

163.62 164.76 A: right 

164.18 168.76 B: all the time but on the other hand i also think to myself you know 

169.19 170.82 B: i'm not you know 

170.90 183.32 B: a person i mean i don't watch the news like religiously every night and you know i don't like the look of stuff on the internet and you know i just basically kinda just you know live my life and when there's a big story i i try to get the big points and you know move on 

183.19 191.15 B: and i'm sure that there's more intelligence and more stuff that that average american does not even know about yeah 

189.13 195.51 A: that we don't know about yeah because i definitely don't read the news either and sometimes when 

195.45 204.08 A: the news is on and they say something about all that's going on i'm very surprised that it's gone so far and i'm like oh man i didn't know that 

201.05 202.17 B: right 

203.92 213.11 A: saddam was doing this or that um i just fe- feel like it's more than what we think as citizens and we don't know all of it you know [noise] 

205.81 207.01 B: right 

211.84 214.94 B: no and i think a lot of people they just don't [mn] 

215.36 227.96 B: i don't know i think people either have a a um really strong stance or um you know or they don't you know they just they have a you know a very strong opinion or 

224.20 225.57 A: mhm 

227.98 233.50 B: it's just it they don't have an opinion at all i don't think there's people there's a lot of people that go back and forth 

233.48 245.59 B: and the people i think that have a really strong opinion are the people who you know they watch the news and they do all this and then i think that a lot of people are like me as i just i don't wanna i don't wanna hear every day all the bad news 

245.45 246.65 A: yeah 

246.04 255.39 B: you know i just i don't wanna be i remember the sense of panic that i had when when i watched the news that morning and and we got it at like six o'clock in the morning 

255.65 256.82 A: oh really 

255.78 256.42 B: so 

256.47 258.43 B: right so it was very 

257.39 260.24 A: oh yeah it was early for you guys [laughter] 

258.78 266.18 B: yeah it was nine o'clock for you guys and so it was six o'clock in the morning here and so it was very startling to wake up to that 

260.32 261.31 A: yeah 

265.83 272.84 A: yeah i didn't even know i didn't even think it was real i my mother was on the phone i'm like what are you talking about [laughter] 

266.24 267.09 B: and 

269.96 271.60 B: i yeah 

272.07 280.80 B: i i actually woke up and um my because the phone had rang i was like you know it was six o'clock in the morning and i don't normally get up until about seven 

280.73 288.05 B: and um i remember that sense of panic that i had after i realized you know gosh this really did happen 

287.68 288.71 A: yeah 

288.09 298.06 B: and i remember going to work and not feeling very like i even i worked in an office about the time when i was by myself a lot and so my husband had the day off and i was like do you wanna come over [laughter] 

297.44 298.62 A: yeah 

298.34 303.49 B: because i just didn't wanna be by myself so i i really can't imagine if something were to happen 

303.76 306.50 B: anywhere near where i am 

306.43 307.38 A: right 

307.22 317.80 B: but on the you know i was actually right before i left work i went to go look at the news and um on the on the web and i for some reason got kinda side tracked into 

318.04 328.03 B: [sigh] i guess it was the biggest terrorist not the biggest terrorist but where a terrorist might strike and one of them is the hoover dam which is i live in arizona 

324.84 325.73 A: right 

328.14 329.24 A: oh really 

328.73 331.98 B: right and i felt oh my gosh you know 

331.06 332.65 A: why the hoover dam 

332.48 336.19 B: because it's a well because it's a landmark 

336.00 337.08 A: yeah 

336.48 337.62 B: um 

337.65 347.00 B: and because it um generates so much energy for the west coast for the west um western port- western portion of the united states 

344.10 345.30 A: that's true 

346.41 347.59 A: right 

346.93 361.02 B: it generates for california nevada you know ah utah and for arizona so much energy that it would just be near impossible to you know have a norm- normal day without having that dam you know flowing 

352.37 353.16 A: right 

360.69 369.18 A: right and me up here in maine [laughter] i i don't think there's anything up here but who knows [laughter] 

361.46 362.35 B: so 

363.42 364.86 B: oh wow 

367.91 373.52 B: yeah you never well you know you could get on the map and you could do something um 

373.82 377.30 B: like there was something about where nuclear 

377.38 384.68 B: generators or something are and i didn't rea- i knew there was a nuclear generator someplace in arizona but i didn't realize that it was in phoenix 

379.21 380.21 A: uh-huh 

384.54 385.56 A: oh 

384.93 393.27 B: which is you know just two hours away from where i'm at and so i was like oh gosh you know if something really would that would very much affect us 

387.59 388.66 A: mhm 

392.98 394.49 A: right yeah 

393.81 395.85 B: so yeah it is 

395.99 398.45 B: i was very surprised when i went to new york 

398.50 403.78 B: um you know it had been over a year but i was very surprised at how people 

404.17 406.44 B: had already gotten so back to normal 

406.29 408.74 A: yeah did you go by plane 

406.71 407.67 B: (( you know )) 

408.96 411.36 B: yeah we did and you know i 

409.48 412.09 A: yeah that's true [laughter] 

411.42 421.23 B: i i was a little nervous and then i thought you know i'm not gonna i just can't live the rest of my life not going anywhere because i'm afraid that somebody might do something 

421.08 422.19 A: yeah 

421.59 429.69 B: so you know we just we we went and you know we actually had a great time but it was really solemn to go to the world trade center area 

429.26 430.19 A: yeah 

429.77 433.30 B: there were a lot of people there that were just really and it really 

433.64 436.74 B: it's almost like when you were there it's just not real 

436.57 437.67 A: yeah 

437.06 440.58 B: and i'm sure that if it were to happen again it would be 

441.26 446.26 A: now the security at the airports um was unbelievable 

443.92 444.75 B: yeah 

446.08 448.14 B: the security was horrible 

447.58 448.92 A: yeah 

448.29 458.81 B: and i was at one point i was a little bit annoyed because i have a small child and i was like okay you're not gonna get that hi- that er stroller through that thing it's just not gonna go you know i mean and it's 

456.75 458.10 A: [laughter] 

458.70 463.90 B: it's all metal and cloth so just feel it all over or whatever you know um 

462.15 463.22 A: right 

463.29 475.08 A: well every time they pinpointed my fiance he's a big man and every time we went through the security thing they would take him to the side and er because he's a man and because he's big i guess 

466.45 467.54 B: (( oh )) 

471.20 472.08 B: oh 

475.02 478.01 B: it seemed really random on all the flights that we were on 

476.84 481.17 A: yeah it did it seemed like it was supposed to be random [laughter] 

480.45 489.55 B: yeah i mean it was i mean there was some old ladies who got stopped there was you know some businessmen that got stopped i got stopped at one point when i was 

484.06 485.50 A: right yeah 

488.68 489.41 A: (( [laughter] )) 

489.42 501.34 B: holding my child and you know i was like okay this is so not [laughter] but you know my my husband did say something he was just like okay now you know i mean what are you gonna you know hijack a plane 

494.37 495.34 A: right 

501.39 511.13 B: you know with a baby you know and i was like oh you know they're just doing their job but it is it's frustrating and and i think that's one thing that americans forget is that they're very used to convenience 

510.94 511.88 A: (( mhm )) 

511.54 514.06 B: and so they don't wanna be inconvenienced 

514.19 520.52 A: right but you gotta think you know anybody could hide something in their shoe in you know 

514.24 515.75 B: and and 

515.91 516.99 B: right 

519.71 534.57 B: oh yeah in my i mean if i'm willing to be a suicide bomber then who says i'm not willing to take my kid with me you know i mean you know i could put anything on that baby and do whatever i guess if i wanted it's just sad to think that someone would actually do that but i'm sure that there is someone out there 

524.93 525.90 A: right 

530.12 531.06 A: right 

534.45 535.65 A: oh yes 

535.19 536.71 B: who would do that 

536.37 537.35 A: (( yes )) 

536.97 549.83 B: you know but i just i don't know on the one hand i would love to think that nothing is gonna happen but i can't imagine that people who are willing to do what they've already done are just gonna just sit back and go okay never mind 

549.36 556.87 A: yeah that's why i'm wondering you know if we attack saddam or whatever is it really gonna take care of the problem 

556.77 570.92 A: i mean as far as the other terrorists are they still gonna follow him or are or the other guy there or are they gonna you know say okay i'm done with terrorists [laughter] i'm done with being a bad guy you know [noise] [noise] 

559.65 560.78 B: yeah 

569.28 571.11 B: yeah i mean 

571.83 577.67 B: [sigh] i know and but the only thing that i when i was on that web site um today 

578.28 586.72 B: what i they had this map and there were just seeing they were going [sigh] like by they just had this thing and it was just called terrorist activity and they must've 

587.12 589.05 B: they must've highlighted 

589.52 595.77 B: ah fifteen different countries between like libya and tunisia and um 

595.82 599.89 B: some middle eastern you know some in france some in italy some
