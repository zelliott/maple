0.33 3.18 B: hi my name is jonna sho 

3.17 5.48 A: hi this is michelle bertner 

5.27 6.87 B: hi [laughter] 

6.16 7.45 A: [laughter] 

7.04 9.86 B: um do you want to start off or do you want me to 

9.71 10.70 A: um 

10.76 13.75 A: why don't you go ahead [laughter] 

11.92 12.93 B: okay 

12.98 23.01 B: um i just wanted to say okay it's will you commit perjury for a um no i would not because um i just c- i'm not a person who lies and 

23.03 29.20 B: um my problem is i'm too honest so i definitely could not commit perjury 

29.69 37.26 A: and i you know i wouldn't do it either i don't think i could live with lying even if it was for a friend um 

33.01 34.13 B: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

37.23 46.96 A: and i think too like i have small children and i would not want to put myself in a situation where i could get in trouble and possibly to go jail or 

44.11 44.98 B: right 

46.11 47.77 B: right 

47.08 50.83 A: whatever and put them in jeopardy also 

49.21 50.19 B: right 

51.02 57.39 A: um that's just not a subject that i'm [laughter] at not really not familiar with 

54.03 55.06 B: right 

55.17 56.69 B: (( yeah um i would )) 

57.39 65.32 B: um yeah well i mean i just feel the same way um i just i mean i don't have children i am single but just my own 

65.27 72.97 B: being i just could not under oath because i would i would just automatically just tell the truth i would just you know 

73.19 75.44 B: i'm just not one to lie um 

76.55 83.35 B: i can't see how anyone really could commit perjury because sooner or later i think they usually find out 

82.70 93.83 A: yeah i would think so too sooner or later i mean you're always going to be worried about being found out down the line somewhere if you agree to do it you would be constantly watching 

86.93 88.13 B: right 

93.42 94.64 B: right 

94.11 99.93 A: to make sure that you weren't going to be in trouble it g- you would never really be free from it i don't think 

99.48 100.74 B: right 

100.45 108.25 A: i don't think i could live with [laughter] always watching out and seeing or possibly you know getting caught in more lies just to 

102.39 103.43 B: (( no )) 

108.86 110.19 B: well i know some 

109.14 111.39 A: keep up the original lie 

111.37 123.30 B: [laughter] i know like um if you ever watch like those judge judys or whatever sometimes people will will commit perjury and the judge just blows it off i don't know if it's because it's on t._v. or what but um 

123.71 126.54 B: i don't know i there's no way i could 

126.04 134.68 A: well and maybe they look at the the seriousness of the case if it's just some person they use it as a personal court [laughter] isn't it 

128.96 130.18 B: right 

132.40 134.63 B: right right the people's court 

134.88 141.64 A: something like white water or [laughter] something big to where it's public figure 

135.79 137.03 B: [laughter] 

137.79 139.11 B: [laughter] 

141.26 143.11 B: (( right right i don't )) 

141.94 143.29 A: but 

143.98 145.01 A: um 

145.15 147.31 A: gosh [laughter] 

145.71 156.74 B: know yeah morally i definitely couldn't plus i just i don't know internally i wouldn't i i don't know i pr- you would probably be able to tell i'm committing perjury i would probably start blushing and i would 

156.91 162.73 B: fidgety and they would probably be able to [laughter] i'm telling a lie so i 

161.86 163.06 A: [laughter] 

163.23 166.05 B: wouldn't even attempt it um 

167.79 168.95 A: oh gosh 

167.90 170.57 B: [noise] i know that on like those um 

170.56 176.72 B: like you were talking about the um the larger you know the more important cases like they'll have on court t._v. or something 

175.77 176.88 A: uh-huh 

176.56 187.78 B: occasionally they will show someone who i think for a family member i think i've seen cases on t._v. well they wi- they will do that and i think sooner or later they usually get caught it's like some 

187.96 190.59 B: slip up or something [laughter] 

190.20 195.02 A: yeah i don't know you would manage to keep everything of your story straight if you 

194.21 195.50 B: yeah 

195.49 204.11 A: if you just kind of made i mean i don't know if people go into those knowing rehearsing exactly what they're going to say so that they're able to get through it or 

196.92 197.91 B: (( exactly )) 

203.28 204.82 B: right 

204.48 208.07 A: or if it just kind of happens for the moment 

206.14 211.72 B: well that's a good idea yeah like if someone told you like if you had a pact and they 

209.71 213.13 A: what to say like if they were wanting you to 

212.15 213.77 B: yeah 

213.33 216.59 A: and said here's what you say this is what happened actually they 

216.33 217.43 B: [laughter] 

216.61 217.75 A: they um 

218.12 221.39 A: had a similar thing on just on a t._v. show 

221.58 223.33 A: the other night where um 

222.20 223.10 B: [laughter] 

224.43 231.90 A: ah well it wasn't exactly perjury but [laughter] whe- where someone had to lie about somebody's re- medical record and 

226.21 226.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

230.69 231.81 B: right 

231.89 239.87 A: in that you could lose your licence and you could get yourself into trouble and i imagine the same type of thing with court 

234.49 235.70 B: yeah 

237.84 238.97 B: right 

240.20 241.24 B: yeah 

240.34 246.37 A: where pretty soon it gets too involved and and you can't maintain it for very long [mn] 

245.58 246.62 B: right 

247.15 249.09 B: that is so true 

248.84 250.08 A: [laughter] 

249.42 250.87 B: [laughter] 

250.19 253.71 A: not that i'll probabl- i will have to worry about going to court for perjury 

253.39 254.75 B: [laughter] 

254.48 256.42 A: [laughter] but 

255.75 259.49 B: yeah they probably have i don't know what the penalty is for that what do they make 

258.40 259.58 A: and you know 

259.67 261.37 A: i have no idea either 

261.11 262.31 B: i don't know if they make you go 

261.60 270.69 A: i tell you now did like with clinton did was there perjury in that one i thought there was with the white water that they were trying to convince certain key people to 

265.86 267.83 B: i think there was 

271.29 275.55 A: testify differently or to not testify at all [laughter] 

273.42 277.15 B: right right yeah i think there was yeah 

276.59 282.95 A: and i could see not testifying at all if you thought you would be put in the position where you'd have to lie or 

281.01 282.48 B: right right 

283.23 285.24 A: or where someone wanted you to 

284.88 288.07 B: right yeah yeah i forgot about that 

286.63 293.09 A: but i'm not sure what happened to those people i'm not very good at politics [laughter] 

290.54 294.29 B: i'm not either i think wate- wasn't watergate there was um 

293.55 296.78 A: i think that or was yeah water watergate 

296.23 297.67 B: watergate 

297.09 300.84 A: and that then clinton's was white water it's the real estate 

299.14 300.19 B: yeah 

300.37 301.79 B: yeah 

301.43 302.59 A: (( but i'll )) 

302.54 307.50 B: yeah and i don't know if if um when clinton was involved with ah um 

308.20 310.63 B: what's her face if there was any 

311.37 316.18 B: i don't know he had to he kind of went through that loophole thing that oral 

314.67 315.39 A: (( t- )) 

315.92 319.14 A: oh yeah [laughter] that's right 

316.29 319.85 B: [laughter] monica lewinski [laughter] 

319.37 325.83 A: but but you know but the thing is he said sexual relations on that and that is sexual relations 

324.93 326.21 B: i know 

325.87 338.16 A: even if he doesn't classify it as sex it is sexual relations so is kissing but [laughter] but so i forgot about that and he ended up getting nailed because ah everything 

327.86 329.52 B: (( right )) 

331.17 332.99 B: [laughter] 

334.20 335.89 B: i thought that's what i thought you were t- 

337.07 338.12 B: yeah 

338.31 340.55 A: came back all the evidence came back 

340.17 341.96 B: yeah so i guess he 

341.65 344.64 A: to where he had to take it back and say yes i did 

343.86 346.20 B: [laughter] 

345.22 347.26 A: so i guess sooner or later you 

347.00 349.33 B: yeah we would get caught 

347.93 353.54 A: need to you need to watch [laughter] because it can ruin your reputation and [laughter] 

352.84 356.69 B: yeah and then you might have to go to jail or 

353.84 355.31 A: [laughter] 

356.90 358.93 B: who knows what 

358.76 360.28 A: oh it's funny 

360.96 362.02 B: um 

361.81 365.15 A: [sigh] oh let's see what else about perjury [laughter] do 

363.77 366.38 B: um i don't know i'm trying to think 

365.37 368.15 A: you think they could have given us an easier topic huh 

367.32 369.58 B: i know i mean um well 

368.58 371.04 A: [laughter] 

370.20 373.67 B: you're lying under oath i guess that's what it is isn't it 

373.48 374.50 A: yeah 

374.34 375.39 B: um 

374.96 376.02 A: yeah 

376.46 377.73 B: (( hmm )) 

377.99 378.87 A: boy 

378.57 380.91 B: i'm sure peo- i'm sure like you know 

381.10 388.45 B: um you know people in gangs maybe gang members or under they maybe plan out that they may lie about things and 

387.80 389.89 A: oh i'm sure they probably do 

390.33 392.08 A: that's probably part of their 

392.38 393.34 B: thing 

393.52 396.08 A: their loyalty [laughter] 

394.61 396.90 B: yeah [laughter] 

396.26 400.17 A: (( [laughter] but gosh it take )) 

399.15 402.36 B: i wonder if once people are in prison 

402.72 403.86 B: um 

404.60 409.40 B: i don't know i wo- i wonder if there's well they not under oath but i wonder if they're 

410.06 414.73 B: sometimes they come out and like say they were lying or something [laughter] you 

414.19 415.38 A: (( uh-huh but )) 

414.94 418.43 B: know they say yeah i did commit that crime or something 

418.34 423.13 A: then they have the people who say who admitted to it to begin with yet never did 

423.12 424.40 B: right 

423.77 430.82 A: which is a weird kind of perjury thing to say you did do a murder or you did do something and you never really did 

425.96 428.03 B: oh yeah yeah 

428.37 429.82 B: yeah 

430.59 431.81 B: right 

432.07 438.06 A: i don't know why people would want to do that but [laughter] but they get their crazy people that [laughter] 

432.62 433.70 B: yeah 

434.51 435.58 B: [laughter] 

437.46 439.13 B: [laughter] where do you live 

438.96 441.94 A: i am in olympia in washington state 

441.49 442.93 B: oh really 

442.32 443.41 A: yeah 

443.11 446.09 B: i'm in um tampa florida 

445.74 449.03 A: oh wow they really matched up two ends of the [laughter] 

446.22 447.43 B: [laughter] 

448.26 449.50 B: i know 

449.16 450.62 A: u._s. didn't they 

450.49 451.49 B: um 

451.71 453.16 B: but um 

453.92 456.55 B: let's see what else about perjury do you 

455.09 458.25 A: (( it's funny [laughter] )) 

456.71 458.82 B: (( do you know anything else about it )) 

458.26 469.62 A: i'm trying to think of what other circumstances you could [laughter] do that besides if it's just ina courtroom or if it could be on documents also considered that or not 

461.48 462.44 B: [laughter] 

467.65 468.82 B: right 

469.56 472.35 B: i don't know i guess it could be 

471.27 475.20 A: because i'm not sure i wish i had a dictionary [laughter] to just see 

473.74 477.33 B: i do have one but i don't think it's going to be too um 

476.31 478.20 A: to descriptive huh 

478.03 480.63 B: no it's just like a little pocket dictionary 

480.74 484.91 A: well do you think we could take up the rest of the time if we ah read the words really 

480.74 481.49 B: (( um )) 

482.95 484.32 B: yeah i'll look it up 

484.39 487.96 B: l. m. n. o. [laughter] perjury 

486.07 487.20 A: (( slowly )) 

487.78 490.47 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

488.80 493.13 B: [laughter] yeah that's why i started to look at my dictionary because i thought no 

492.72 495.03 A: [laughter] 

494.28 497.12 B: okay perjury q. r 

497.30 498.25 B: (( s. )) 

498.72 499.87 B: um 

501.53 504.56 B: so i have a question for you what would you um 

504.94 507.76 B: like if you were um the judge and 

507.99 511.20 B: how would you view someone who committed perjury i mean 

510.58 514.30 A: [sigh] oh boy i think that would be a hard job 

514.34 518.18 A: because what if it was i mean not something dire 

518.07 519.24 B: right 

518.38 521.43 A: but yet the same law applies to everybody 

521.10 522.42 B: right 

521.55 526.44 A: but you'd want to make exceptions in some cases in case it was just 

526.59 528.83 A: something someone was embarrassed about 

528.24 530.66 B: right right right that's true 

529.46 532.15 A: you know how i don't know how you um 

533.06 541.29 A: judge on some of those things i think that'd be a hard job to say do we do the same thing for everybody no matter what the degree or 

534.35 535.29 B: right 

541.33 546.92 A: do we hold certain people more accountable [laughter] or or do we just look at the situation 

543.64 544.68 B: uh-huh 

546.75 548.02 B: right 

546.93 550.07 A: and how badly it affects the entire case 

549.19 553.61 B: yeah because it could be just something embarrassing right or something like really 

552.64 555.66 A: yeah well like even with like clinton's thing 

555.60 556.68 B: yeah 

555.80 559.25 A: obviously he was embarrassed this was a personal life thing 

558.92 560.02 B: uh-huh 

559.41 561.62 A: and he lied under oath [laughter] 

561.14 562.12 B: uh-huh 

562.33 563.30 A: but 

563.64 567.31 A: you know it's [sigh] it's hard to know how to punish for that 

566.72 569.59 B: (( yeah i would i don't know that's t- )) 

568.64 577.90 A: because it is something kind of in his personal life i mean a- at the time obviously he was in office so he should have been [laughter] 

576.18 577.38 B: [laughter] 

578.04 582.30 A: keeping himself in control but [laughter] but ah 

579.87 581.59 B: [laughter] 

582.73 589.03 B: now it is p. u. r. isn't it perjury is that how you spell it p. u. r. or is it i looked at 

589.54 591.04 B: is it yeah it would be 

590.38 592.53 A: gosh i i think so 

592.21 593.91 B: yeah and i can't even 

594.40 595.78 B: p. u. r. 

596.42 599.34 B: (( hmm i don't even see it in this dictionary ))
