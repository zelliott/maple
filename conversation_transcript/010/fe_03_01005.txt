10.96 14.19 A: you okay sure um i guess 

14.55 21.17 A: how do i think the people in the nation would react if there was an attack um 

17.60 18.50 B: uh-huh 

21.23 29.62 A: you know since we've already been through that i think they would act somewhat like they did it with shock and sadness and and then anger 

31.06 32.60 B: yeah i agree 

34.75 36.49 A: and um 

37.75 41.36 A: i suppose my reaction would be 

41.80 43.50 A: ah much the same 

43.88 46.87 A: [noise] i tend to be much more calm than most people 

47.36 50.74 A: because i have three kids that i need to be calm for i guess 

51.20 52.38 B: yeah 

52.93 54.64 A: what would your reaction be 

54.13 65.68 B: ah well you know it kinda depends if if i was in the area you know where the attack took place i'd probably would be more 

66.02 70.47 B: you know terrorized or more scared or 

67.78 68.86 A: mhm 

70.68 84.44 B: you know more whatever but you know if it's if it's kinda like you know this last one you know being in new york well new york is all the way on the other side of the country from where i live 'cause i live in new mexico 

82.48 86.39 A: yeah i'm in the center of the country so i felt the same way 

86.60 88.02 B: i mean you know i 

88.21 96.13 B: i when i heard about it i was on my way to bowling you know when they said that the pla- airplane two you know flew into the world trade center 

96.14 105.87 B: and you know i th- at first i thought well you know it's not a terrorist attack you know but after everything else happened you know it was obvious that it was 

105.62 106.61 A: right 

106.25 109.14 B: but i live in a town where 

109.18 111.12 B: there is a refinery 

111.36 112.31 A: uh-huh 

111.97 114.58 B: and we have had 

115.07 124.32 B: people outside the refinery taking pictures of the refinery and the f._b._i. was called in and you know it's 

124.41 127.23 B: you know it could happen here you know 

126.99 129.35 A: oh absolutely absolutely 

128.03 133.84 B: i mean it could happen almost anywhere yeah but you know you know with the refinery here and 

133.94 138.39 B: in new mexico we have sandia labs and los alamos and you know 

138.01 139.05 A: right 

138.41 148.12 B: a lot of things that could cause a terrorist attack in new mexico and i think if it were happened here you know i would be more terrorized than 

148.95 150.66 B: if it happened somewhere else 

150.20 151.57 A: exactly 

151.70 162.49 A: exactly i'm in colorado near n._o._r._a._d. near where they hayman fire was so that was our first thought as well it was you know what if they hit n._o._r._a._d. what are we gonna do what are we gonna do 

154.92 156.15 B: oh really 

162.00 163.11 B: mhm 

163.18 166.70 A: but yeah it is frightening and i think 

166.86 169.19 A: we need to be more prepared 

169.61 171.64 A: than what most people are 

172.24 176.03 A: and i'm certainly not saying i'm prepared by any means [laughter] 

174.57 178.96 B: i'm not i mean you know they were talking about putting plastic on your windows 

179.09 182.39 B: and everything like that and you know i mean 

182.49 190.52 B: i'm not prepared at all i mean you know i don't have water i don't i mean i have a bunch of canned goods but i mean i don't have water put up and 

190.22 192.07 A: no i don't have any of that either 

190.96 193.17 B: i don't you know i mean 

193.54 197.30 B: but i guess you know i guess i'm just not 

198.07 200.34 B: scared of it i mean you know i 

201.37 213.44 B: if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen i i really don't you know i think our country's doing what they can to prevent it and you know be watchful for us but 

213.63 215.16 B: you know um 

215.95 221.88 B: [sigh] things can happen even when the country's trying their best not to let it happen 

221.75 222.77 A: right 

223.13 229.39 A: and i think people are fearing that should we go to war there will be more terrorist acts here 

228.70 230.83 B: well i think there will be i think 

229.73 232.82 A: and i'm i'm i'm almost sure there will be 

231.77 232.65 B: yeah 

232.73 233.66 B: yeah 

232.92 238.10 A: and um that's just kind of the way of human nature you know of retaliate 

239.03 241.89 A: the best way you personally can so 

242.00 243.02 B: but like 

242.00 243.90 A: i think it will happen i mean 

243.06 252.31 B: yeah like on the news yesterday i heard that in new mexico they were trying to pass a law that in the state of new mexico you didn't have to have a 

252.44 266.21 B: birth certificate or anything showing where you were born and to get a driver's licence in the state of new mexico and they were saying you know that's just asking for trouble from terrorists 

259.90 261.01 A: really 

265.80 268.01 A: oh absolutely it is 

267.24 278.19 B: and you know it was it was kind of like you know why [laughter] why are you all talking about this when you know we're supposed to be you know trying to prevent terrorism and not 

278.37 281.11 B: trying not to cause it [laughter] and that 

280.97 283.11 A: or to leave the door open for sure 

282.18 290.63 B: yeah i mean that's basically what it is i mean you know just leaving the door open wide open for you know somebody to come in and you know 

290.78 299.79 B: get a driver's licence in new mexico and not know where they're from or what you know they're doing or and you know do whatever i mean 

299.66 310.11 A: right well yeah and i see that a lot in travel my husband travels a ton and in fact he was on his way to newark airport that morning 

309.97 310.69 B: (( mmm )) 

310.43 311.81 A: (( and )) 

312.66 314.16 A: he says 

314.37 317.31 A: there's not really that big of a difference 

317.34 324.23 A: as far as he can tell other than when he goes through security he always has to take off his belt and his shoes 

324.79 328.03 A: which that makes sense after some of the other attempts 

327.09 328.50 B: mhm really 

328.15 330.86 A: but you know those are pretty little 

332.51 333.58 A: (( you know )) 

333.75 341.56 A: i know in in other countries because we've travelled in other countries you don't leave a bag sitting anywhere you don't you know 

341.63 346.57 A: you're arrested if there's a bag sitting and you come back to it and that kind of thing 

347.21 348.70 A: there's just ah 

348.74 354.02 A: i think we need to be a little more vigilant about it if we are in fact afraid that it's gonna happen 

354.08 354.94 B: yeah 

355.50 363.99 B: well i'm gonna be taking a plane ride in june my first plane ride in [laughter] years and years and years and years and years

370.66 375.39 B: gatlinburg well knoxville tennessee which you know i mean 

373.18 374.12 A: mhm 

375.61 377.46 B: to me that's gonna be 

377.58 388.85 B: kinda nerve wracking because i mean you don't know what's gonna happen you don't ever know for sure whether there's somebody on that airplane that's gonna cause trouble or 

388.91 390.69 B: you know whatever 

390.71 391.70 A: right 

390.84 391.55 B: so 

391.83 396.91 B: i thought maybe i'll ride the bus [laughter] you know i can't do that 

393.91 396.23 A: [laughter] 

396.82 404.05 A: well my husband being the traveller that he is my son is supposed to go to a camping camping trip up in

424.76 426.19 B: [laughter] 

426.39 427.84 B: yeah well 

428.22 429.57 B: you know it's 

429.83 439.22 B: it's probably gonna happen i don't see any other way really we can do anything with iraq other than have a war with them i mean you know it's 

439.23 441.68 B: i think we got to do something 

441.47 448.30 A: [noise] oh i agree i agree i think we've waited around long enough he obviously wants nothing 

441.70 443.45 B: with them i mean 

448.61 452.01 A: to do he being hussein to do with 

452.28 456.09 A: helping out the situation and realizing that you know 

456.14 459.85 A: if i get rid of these and play nice everyone else is gonna play nice 

459.79 461.74 B: yeah it's not gonna 

460.35 463.96 A: you know people like that don't work it out in this world 

463.27 466.32 B: no it's not gonna happen i mean you know he's gonna 

466.56 469.15 B: he's gonna keep you know 

470.57 475.75 B: doing what he's doing and they probably do have you know things that could 

476.10 480.37 B: really cause trouble in the world i mean you know with 

480.46 484.03 B: anthrax or whatever i mean you know 

484.96 486.17 A: absolutely 

485.54 487.80 B: plus bombs and you know 

487.70 489.83 A: whatever he's got in his arsenal 

488.58 489.41 B: yeah 

489.84 491.93 B: and we'll never know what he's got 

491.73 492.53 A: no 

492.95 497.29 A: i don't think so i think he's hidden a lot of it and terrorized his own people 

496.78 497.63 B: uh-huh 

497.41 500.50 A: into thinking that they have to hide it so 

500.58 509.21 B: yeah that's probably where it is all you know that's what i heard you know that it was in the poor people's neighborhoods and you know 

509.49 512.21 B: where we don't think that it would be in 

512.03 513.13 A: oh yeah 

514.11 514.92 B: so 

515.60 518.38 B: but i agree you know i don't 

519.16 527.15 B: and it's not just you know people in iraq either i mean you know there's terrorists from all over plus there's terrorists in our own country there 

526.34 529.41 A: oh yeah we have our own terrorists to worry about as well 

527.90 531.28 B: yeah that are from the united states and you know they're 

531.94 534.63 B: you never know when they're gonna do something mm mhm 

534.57 543.03 A: well and it's interesting how a small situation can create such a terrorist type atmosphere 

543.47 555.77 A: we had a situation here where a couple of boys stole a car and killed the couple that owned the car and ended up camping out in my neighborhood after they did this and 

556.23 565.29 A: even af- nobody even knew they were in the neighborhood until after they'd been arrested and taken away but you would have thought in my little town neighborhood that 

565.60 573.12 A: these people just [laughter] had terrorized the entire neighborhood and they hadn't even really spoken to anyone 

573.15 576.01 A: it was by you know someone running past them 

576.06 577.93 A: smelling a fire that they 

578.18 581.15 A: were caught but ah 

582.43 586.12 A: it did terrorize people and and their reactions were 

586.20 588.67 A: panic get the kids out of here don't you know 

588.60 589.57 B: mhm 

590.23 593.44 B: that's what i was saying you know if it's close to home 

593.63 597.41 B: people you know react differently and 

597.82 599.89 B: you know show more panic
