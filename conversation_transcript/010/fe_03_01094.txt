37.28 38.22 B: right 

38.70 39.40 B: yeah 

39.89 45.78 A: the only place i could even think of going if i had to for a million bucks would be somewhere like australia 

46.36 46.78 B: yes 

47.20 47.99 B: why would that be 

60.65 63.39 A: school wise and things like that we don't do as well here 

63.59 64.85 B: right um 

65.35 68.85 B: we have some acquaintances from australia so i was thinking the same thing 

70.82 71.41 B: yes 

74.14 77.82 A: my gosh you know thailand egypt even everywhere 

78.00 81.18 A: and the stories they come back and tell me about how 

81.27 89.30 A: it's just amazing the little things we take for granted even getting to sit at a table and eat or or little things like that other countries don't get to do 

89.41 90.03 B: right 

90.14 92.39 B: yes exactly yes and i know the uh 

92.89 94.55 B: like you mentioned australia

102.89 103.29 A: yeah 

103.41 109.74 B: yes i know these people live well the husband was from australia and the wife was here from the states and they came back 

110.19 115.67 B: and they're still here and i've always wondered why they never went back because they really have missed it since coming back to the states 

116.90 118.25 B: you know but um 

118.46 127.04 A: the only thing i could think of that would make me nervous would be the i don't know if you watch like the discovery channel a lot they have lots and lots of poisonous animals 

126.81 128.36 B: oh really no i don't 

127.21 130.17 A: that would be the only thing that would make me really 

129.72 130.30 B: yes 

130.52 131.11 B: yeah 

130.94 135.63 A: you know that come in your house that come in your yard that or just any- anywhere and everywhere that you are 

133.78 134.26 B: oh 

135.74 136.28 B: uh huh 

136.60 137.01 A: but 

137.16 139.53 A: a million dollars wouldn't cut it i wouldn't think 

139.10 142.90 B: no i i don't think so i don't think any amount of money honestly 

143.88 144.91 B: i don't know 

145.34 147.18 A: now if there were a reason 

147.29 151.87 A: to do it say a million bucks if i had done something illegal here 

152.12 152.63 B: uh huh 

152.14 162.14 A: that might be a different story or if or if one of my family members had done something illegal that you know that that would be i would jump on that in a minute 

154.87 156.20 B: a good out huh 

162.28 163.50 A: but 

162.29 164.08 B: right ex- 

164.24 165.69 B: a real good reason huh 

165.27 170.62 A: but but other than that i think you know we're pretty safe over here 

169.01 170.55 B: right yes 

171.12 174.62 B: that'll be interesting to see huh they're making a pretty big decision here in the future 

175.08 175.48 B: uh 

175.12 176.87 A: oh with the war yeah 

176.38 177.09 B: yeah

186.34 187.19 B: right 

187.50 188.45 A: so 

187.52 189.68 B: i i've not really gone anywhere 

189.81 191.84 B: else i've always been here in the states

213.51 214.05 B: um 

214.92 217.95 B: he just said you know it's amazing the different parts of the 

218.27 219.11 B: countries there 

219.22 221.99 B: how different the people can be and how they can treat you and 

222.67 224.11 B: he liked jordan a lot 

224.54 225.21 B: but he just 

225.55 227.88 B: you know did make the comment that they're very poor 

228.42 232.14 B: and basically like you had said you know we take a lot for granted here in the states 

233.08 233.76 B: and 

233.99 234.58 B: um 

234.76 237.32 A: well just women being able to talk 

237.08 237.88 B: right 

237.66 242.51 A: a lot of you know most of those countries over there the women aren't allowed to say a darn word you know 

241.27 241.88 B: right 

242.05 244.43 B: and covered he he mentioned how they had to dress

245.07 246.83 B: you know they couldn't show their face or anything 

248.97 250.64 B: but very friendly people he said 

252.19 262.41 A: yeah that i never got to go anywhere my my father went to the philippines and was just talking about the fact that over there um everything is so much shorter 

262.60 263.10 B: uh huh 

263.08 271.56 A: you know the toilet seats sit smaller the cars are sh- everything the doorways are all too short the you know and my husband went to korea

275.90 276.63 B: oh my 

276.73 284.69 A: because he's six foot three and everybody there is maybe five six five you know so he couldn't fit in anything 

278.66 279.14 B: ouch 

281.79 282.33 B: uh huh 

284.24 288.90 B: right yeah i had a brot- i have a brother that went to the philippines actually um 

289.86 292.43 B: and he was saying how the women (( )) 

292.68 297.23 B: backwards it was backwards for him to get used to over there because the women don't open the doors for the men 

297.79 299.26 A: oh 

297.99 303.18 B: and and they follow behind the men you know it's re- it's just backwards in that way 

304.28 305.87 B: so but he enjoyed the philippines 

306.48 310.67 B: he actually married a lady there he enjoyed it so well 

308.62 309.18 A: well 

310.37 311.75 A: and he's still there 

311.29 315.36 B: no no he came back and she's still there unfortunately 

313.03 313.77 A: oh 

315.73 318.40 B: he's been trying to get her here now for two years 

318.80 323.24 B: but because they got married in the philippines they will not allow her to come over here 

323.41 324.69 A: they don't recognize it here 

324.57 334.66 B: hm mhm but well there they the their the philippine government doesn't want to let her leave to come to the united states they say it would have been better if he would have just even 

334.85 339.39 B: got engaged in the philippines and brought her over she could have come on a fiancee visa 

340.11 340.94 A: oh 

340.43 346.22 B: but now because they're they got married in the philippines there's all this red tape they're going through trying to get her here 

347.02 349.08 A: so how does that work uh the other way around 

349.56 352.44 A: does is he allowed in in and out of the country when he wants 

352.89 353.31 B: i don't 

353.58 354.36 A: because he's 

353.68 359.83 B: i think well you know i yes pretty much so because i mean just like as if he were going to travel there for the first time 

359.99 363.11 B: i don't there'd be a problem he'd have to get a visa and you know he uh 

363.28 364.26 B: a passport er 

364.44 365.63 B: and whatever 

366.22 367.80 B: just make travel plans but 

368.24 372.67 B: she tells him it's so bad over there right now she wouldn't even want to think of him going back over there 

372.79 373.27 A: yeah 

373.35 374.21 B: you know because they 

374.31 374.58 B: al 

374.74 376.82 B: qaeda qaeda stuff you know they 

377.14 379.04 B: think there's a lot of his men there 

379.69 380.89 B: and um 

381.55 384.86 B: it's just really a dangerous time over there for them in the philippines 

386.33 387.05 A: golly 

387.23 388.82 B: yeah so it's kind of scary 

388.98 390.06 B: feel bad for her 

391.32 393.81 B: my brother just raves about how wonderful she is 

394.03 396.91 B: you know that i guess the women really wait on their men over there and 

397.02 397.79 B: stuff and

410.28 416.35 A: uh uh yeah i was going to say i'm much too i'm much too self deploring to be able to stand that i couldn't do that 

415.96 416.78 B: right 

416.58 423.47 A: i couldn't have you know my husband and i do everything together we don't one of us tell the other what to do so i don't think i could handle that 

421.64 424.45 B: right yeah yes 

425.90 426.49 B: yes 

427.13 428.43 B: so but my 

438.55 439.13 B: oh really 

439.81 440.93 B: it's difficult huh 

440.71 448.86 A: i would definitely you know if it came down to finding some place that was great i would go if it were for my son wait i'm on the phone
