108.49 117.50 B: ah outsmart ourselves or out think ourselves so we've made life awf- awful complicated it would be really nice if we could simplify things a little bit more 

113.65 114.84 A: mhm

155.15 168.69 B: um i don't know i i don't i don't know as it really matters if we get that far off topic because it's it it was a rather easy question to answer there wasn't a whole lot of you know necessary discussion [laughter] 

168.05 178.80 A: that's true you're right the finality of not seeing friends not ever returning to your your home your way of life your family that's ooh wow that that's too big

220.92 231.49 A: although i don't know the landscape well enough to know where i just know that it's um it's very pretty in the pictures and there's a lot of land and ah a lot of snow in the winter 

229.73 239.90 B: yeah well [cough] we actually haven't been getting an awful lot of snow lately as a matter of fact ah today we were outsi- i was outside in my t shirt 

231.87 233.05 A: [laughter] 

239.58 240.78 A: oh wow 

240.01 241.94 B: of course you know 

240.82 242.03 A: (( that's fabulous )) 

242.20 248.40 B: yeah well it it's it's been the first really nice day it's supposed to be that way tomorrow you know too but you know that's 

246.47 247.71 A: mhm 

248.48 262.51 B: you know one of those things that i i'm i've become kind of unhappy with the area that i was born and raised in i mean i i'm forty years old and what's happened in the last thirty years just you know with the build up and everything it's 

257.87 259.29 A: mhm 

261.87 263.35 A: mhm 

262.57 275.22 B: used to be a lot more farmland in the area now now you can't you know i have a friend who would like to buy a farm in the area and all the farms have been turned into subdivisions so the land prices are just so incredible i mean i'm sure 

264.70 266.00 A: mhm 

275.08 278.95 B: it's nothing compared to out california what part of california are you in 

278.80 287.36 A: i'm about twenty miles south of san francisco um in one of the areas that used to be a farm that is totally built up and they're trying to 

287.79 290.20 A: to get every square inch out of now 

290.29 292.60 A: so i can totally relate to what you're saying 

293.23 294.64 B: yeah i was 

294.74 305.63 B: i i'm i'm ah real interested in the ah you know here we go getting off topic again but the the politic aspect of the things that have been going on in california and what not with 

300.67 302.37 A: [laughter] 

304.62 305.75 A: mhm 

305.64 313.59 B: the oh lack of resources electricity water and what not has that been ah major problem for you out there 

309.63 310.68 A: mhm 

313.16 323.79 A: that hasn't been a problem for me at all um i've been one of those people that has not ever been touched by the water shortage ah even when people around me were i wasn't affected by the major earthquakes 

323.74 324.77 B: mhm 

323.94 331.15 A: um a lot of people i know were ah for some reason the area that i lived in has just been um untouched 

332.06 345.68 B: yeah it's gonna be interesting as the population keeps expanding especially if we keep having such dry climate i mean it's just it's been getting drier and drier plus i don't know where does a good portion of the water does it come from ah 

345.47 350.91 B: is it the colorado river that gets shipped over to you from ah other states or 

349.76 356.71 A: most of our ah most of our water comes from lake tahoe and nevada and the runoff from all of the mountains 

354.47 355.34 B: yeah 

356.58 357.57 B: mhm 

356.96 361.58 A: so in the years where we get really good snow we don't have a water problem um and 

361.81 370.37 A: our climate used to be wetter we used to have consistent rain what happens now is we have periods of dryness followed by torrential rain um 

371.07 382.10 A: so it it is changing as we're increasing our demand for water and i i don't know where that's going to go and i don't if developers have any concept of that or the alleged planners i'm 

382.02 387.04 A: not quite sure how they got that name but ah i'll go with it for the moment [laughter] 

382.06 383.08 B: yeah 

386.67 399.93 B: well it's it's what and it's what i've heard from i- in another context that you know we plan for the next you know ten years whereas in some of the older countries they plan for the next hundred you know it's a whole 

399.16 400.31 A: wow 

399.81 401.90 B: different concept and ah 

401.94 416.34 B: i know because ah ah one of the things there's nevada their population is you know really exploding and they're now they're getting kind of jealous you know of oh where's all our water going and plus there's a lot of the ah 

414.57 415.37 A: yeah 

416.37 417.60 B: um 

417.68 423.39 B: energy being generated you know a lot of now there's i'm trying to think now um 

423.69 428.18 B: ah was it hoover dam is that that's at lake is that in um 

428.24 430.67 A: no i don't think we're hoover 

428.66 429.57 B: nevada ah 

432.03 436.04 B: and i'm trying to thi- because i was there my my in laws live in vegas 

436.04 440.09 A: oh okay well then you know how much that's grown that's just amazing 

439.89 448.26 B: yeah that's yeah they live out there ah a lot of my fa- a lot of people i could never that's that's like an alien landscape to me 

447.65 449.88 A: [laughter] 

448.77 456.24 B: i mean it really is i mean i have i have fun going out there three days is enough i mean i'm such a poor gambler i can't afford more than three days at a time 

453.12 454.64 A: mhm 

455.14 456.82 A: [laughter] 

456.77 466.40 B: but ah it really is an alien landscape i've only been to california once and even that kind of strange i i need the change of ah seasons 

461.86 463.07 A: mhm 

466.26 468.40 A: well that's the thing i miss 

466.48 467.95 B: (( i don't )) 

469.19 470.19 A: yeah 

470.89 481.49 B: well it's like what you get right now is um like i said i was out here in my t shirt here today well it got to sixty one degrees but when it's been twenty below that feels like eighty 

476.90 477.71 A: mhm 

478.49 479.59 A: mhm 

482.21 485.48 A: wow that makes for that makes a lot of sense it really does 

486.65 494.11 A: i i miss fall tremendously and while we do have spring here um without winter it's not 

494.80 506.33 A: you know it's just colder in the winter and it's wetter it's not like spring and the fall where you really feel it sort of new promise and everything has that that sense of growth and it just smells different and feels different 

506.52 508.82 A: i do miss that immensely 

509.44 517.91 B: yeah around here fall is my favorite time of year spring tends to be wet you know with everything melting and what not you get kind of muddy but fall we have 

514.82 516.43 A: mhm 

517.92 521.44 B: a especially ah the the latest um 

521.56 530.27 B: you know i don't know ten years it the i i believe the climate is really has changed because i can remember so much more snow when i was younger 

523.43 524.73 A: mhm 

529.92 531.23 A: mhm 

530.97 540.26 B: and ah right now um we have days in november that are you know get into the sixties it gets kind of um 

540.47 541.64 B: (( how )) 

542.03 548.03 B: it it gets on your nerves after a while honestly i mean one of the things around here in wisconsin ah 

547.91 549.22 A: mhm 

548.11 554.33 B: a- at the end of at the end of ah november ah both weekends on both sides of um

558.39 559.45 A: mhm 

559.01 562.68 B: and you're supposed to be out in the snow when that happens a- 

562.06 562.89 A: (( yes )) 

562.80 574.23 B: and ah i mean two years ago we got pictures of me out in my boxer shorts out on the pier having a margarita [laughter] it was just a joke but i was got you know it was 

569.58 570.74 A: (( oh my goodness )) 

574.33 589.00 B: so warm it just it's not supposed to be that way and and really it has a lot it has not been that cold it gets cold a lot later in the year and does not stay as cold this year we didn't have much snow matter of fact we had most of our snow here i believe in march 

582.92 583.90 A: mhm 

589.06 591.11 B: and now it's all melted 

589.49 590.23 A: that's 

590.45 596.37 A: that's amazing and yet the people on the east coast have really been blanketed that that is interesting 

596.39 599.95 B: well it's just it's the weather patterns i think but the part of the problem 

598.52 599.65 A: yeah
