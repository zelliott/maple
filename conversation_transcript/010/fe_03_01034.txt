18.14 25.73 A: and i guess i i suppose if i if i had to render an opinion based upon what we saw in new york and just generally 

25.91 31.76 A: uh how people tend to react in a crisis situation i think that you would see an awful lot of panic 

32.60 33.52 A: uh i think that 

32.93 33.71 B: (( )) definitely 

43.11 55.03 A: for example at nine eleven if you saw similar type of (( )) occurring hopefully nothing like that will ever happen but if they were to occur um you know i think it's just normal human behavior that you're going to see 

56.04 58.57 A: uh see the panic i personally 

59.31 60.11 A: uh 

60.67 61.40 A: i 

61.75 64.34 A: i have mixed feelings about it because 

77.44 80.42 A: you know what's in our mind you know because panic does set in 

80.54 82.58 A: and and how do you feel about it 

83.37 84.54 B: well i've just seen 

84.94 88.99 B: you know the panic on the news where people are going out and buying duct tape and plastic 

89.41 90.76 B: and we've just been warned of 

91.16 92.06 B: possible attacks 

92.57 93.05 A: hm mhm 

93.09 93.53 B: so 

94.07 97.39 B: if something were to happen it would just be total chaos 

97.60 98.06 A: hm mhm 

97.96 100.90 B: i mean people don't know what to do in that type of a situation 

101.17 101.78 A: hm mhm 

102.74 108.68 A: well let me ask a another question here that we can open up dialogue on is the website 

109.25 111.32 A: uh that the homeland security 

111.42 113.48 A: people have in place have you seen it 

113.99 114.84 B: no i have not 

114.88 120.62 A: well i haven't really gone through it in any great detail but just on the surface level you know it 

120.74 129.83 A: it seems you know eh it seems odd because it just seems so high level very basic things uh that people are being told 

130.24 136.63 A: eh eh it doesn't seem like that we are getting the kind of detail that i would expect to see for example 

136.76 144.37 A: in the event of uh an attack of some type you see a man running or you know his his shirt on fire it's almost like a cartoon 

145.22 147.36 A: and and then it says something like run 

148.01 152.93 A: um it just doesn't make a lot of sense to me as well as the sheeting and the duct tape 

153.03 154.81 A: i don't see how that's going to do people 

154.92 155.36 A: you know 

156.05 158.80 A: i don't see how that's going to be any kind of a helpful 

159.51 162.99 A: helpful tool in the event of a terrorist attack how's that going to help you 

159.87 160.43 B: no 

163.35 167.89 B: it gives people a band-aid and uh a simple level of comfort that they can count on 

168.35 170.27 B: oh i can protect myself when 

170.74 172.31 B: re- in reality you really can't 

172.81 174.60 A: it would be almost be like you driving 

175.15 182.08 A: um uh you you really you know having a major car wreck hitting a telephone pole and being seriously injured and someone giving you a band-aid 

182.58 184.47 A: and it just doesn't make any kind of sense 

182.72 183.11 B: yeah 

185.34 186.24 A: uh to me 

186.77 189.19 A: eh eh and this whole terrorism thing 

189.80 190.61 A: is 

191.45 192.54 A: opening up 

192.79 195.69 A: a lot of questions for me um 

195.94 199.90 A: the panic i i guess the the the question to get to remain focus 

200.61 202.53 A: the question was around panic right 

203.40 203.84 B: right 

204.16 205.81 A: well but i think that um 

206.53 210.23 A: to avoid panic i think that we need to be pro-active now 

210.78 216.65 A: and and and better understand what we can do to prepare ourselves and i don't think this sheeting and duct tape is going to do it 

217.25 222.91 A: uh i don't think that's going to make anybody feel comfortable it probably just worries people even more because now we really know 

218.41 218.72 B: mhm 

223.49 228.76 A: that uh now we really know that we really that we're we don't have any real kind of protection 

229.51 231.80 A: well as well you probably 

232.17 232.73 A: um 

232.93 236.72 A: keep hearing um all these comments about airport security 

237.42 237.82 B: right 

238.25 241.06 A: i mean do you believe that there's been improvement in airport 

241.34 242.01 A: security 

242.69 246.03 B: well i don't fly but i do live around a major city where 

246.35 247.92 B: we have two airports and 

248.45 250.84 B: the only thing i've seen is just more delays in 

251.19 252.54 B: passengers getting through 

254.01 257.30 A: that that's uh that's true and you know that's what i hear from everyone 

257.85 260.88 A: and and i think a lot of people believe that so i think there would be 

261.41 265.47 A: even more panic if i think if there was an attack at an airport 

265.67 271.03 A: you know quite frankly i i just don't believe that that we're adequately prepared 

271.40 275.17 A: i don't know that we're prepared to defend our ports our airports 

275.80 276.49 A: um 

276.95 282.72 A: i'd i don't know that we're prepared to protect our children in the schools i mean we really haven't done 

283.45 293.38 A: you know much to we haven't really implemented many changes in terms of protection all we're really doing is talking about all these alerts 

294.20 294.62 B: right 

297.06 298.36 B: (( )) 

304.54 305.86 A: but what are we doing 

306.19 309.62 A: you know and that just i think that we're really you know coming short 

310.47 314.19 A: on the sheeting and all this stuff and and the other part of it is i wonder 

320.82 326.42 A: the people that attacked us and created nine eleven is osama bin laden and all of his terrorists 

327.07 328.31 A: and i think that 

328.71 333.07 A: we need to be completely focused on getting him and all the terror cells ac- around the world 

344.33 346.98 A: and then we're having conflicts with north korea 

347.22 350.35 A: so i think it's a very scary situation 

350.78 351.39 A: and 

351.92 354.62 A: and quite honestly very volatile 

355.21 357.54 A: and we might be inflaming people 

357.85 358.33 B: right 

358.41 361.61 A: across the world cause we have to remember that if we go to 

361.93 363.02 A: war with iraq 

363.14 366.68 A: we already have a problem in mideast middle eastern people 

366.78 368.14 A: disliking americans 

368.68 372.28 A: and i think uh i would be afraid quite frankly that 

372.39 372.80 A: um 

373.13 380.88 A: the next two generations would just hate us and want to go after our kids as well in addition to all of the problems in our lifetime 

381.46 388.94 A: so i think that perhaps we ought to hold off and i mean not let saddam hussein off the hook 

389.13 390.92 A: now keep the pressure on him 

391.40 394.52 A: i think britain took a really good step today when they were 

394.98 396.26 A: you know put the six 

419.99 424.59 A: not not take on too much at one time because i it's uh i think it's uh 

425.05 427.58 A: could create problems for us it could 

427.72 432.68 A: it could cause a terrorist to want to come in and attack us uh just to show us that they're still there 

432.78 435.95 A: you know that they're not afraid i mean there there's a whole myriad of reasons right 

436.51 436.88 B: right 

437.13 439.60 B: but as a u._s. citizen do we have any say in 

439.85 441.69 B: whether or not our country really goes to war 

442.07 442.46 A: hm mhm 

443.20 443.64 B: i mean 

443.81 447.32 B: we have the right to vote for the president and we're supposed to support him 

446.16 446.49 A: hm mhm 

447.92 449.32 B: but we don't have the ultimate 

450.07 452.52 B: deciding factor as to whether or not we are going to go to war 

461.67 465.82 A: and the president seemed to feel that was irrelevant whether people protested or not 

473.45 480.52 A: i struggle with one person you know making such a tremendous decision when 

481.17 484.49 A: i feel we still have options uh i mean i i feel like that 

485.01 493.85 A: what's the big hurry you know i mean i i people keep telling me well well well wel- this been going on for twelve years not really because i don't think we've been applying the kind of pressure 

494.61 500.50 A: on this guy that has been going on since nine eleven you know i mean i think everybody 

498.95 499.39 B: no 

500.06 502.00 B: clinton had made him his friend 

500.71 501.46 A: woke up 

502.45 503.02 A: pardon 

503.43 504.69 B: clinton made him his friend 

505.06 506.49 A: oh uh yeah exactly 

507.02 508.71 A: well but the point here is that 

508.96 510.78 A: the pressure started on 

511.65 512.46 A: saddam 

521.68 525.04 A: so i think we just need to keep up the pressure you know don't give him 

525.21 526.85 A: you know don't uh
