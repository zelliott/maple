30.52 33.75 B: do you think you would panic in a terrorist attack

36.74 37.53 B: i 

40.46 44.24 A: when everybody was buying duct tape and everything for their house 

44.45 45.41 B: (( uh-uh ))

54.92 60.31 B: if they had an idea where it was going to be you know it wouldn't be quite so bad but 

57.06 57.98 A: hit 

60.48 65.34 B: i didn't personally buy the duct tape either i'm thinking what good is that going to do me 

65.08 71.04 A: exact- like once i kept listening to it on the news and it's saying it really wouldn't help you in the long run 

71.62 80.16 A: i'm not one of the persons that panicked before but i think if they said you know chemical warfare has started i think i would panic 

80.00 83.10 B: i think i would too because that's something you can't see 

83.50 84.85 A: exactly 

83.65 84.26 B: [cough] 

85.81 86.43 B: [cough]

92.71 96.52 B: you know and it's like you never get colds in arizona right wrong 

96.25 99.41 A: right that's why everybody goes out there for allergies right 

99.24 102.95 B: right but they've brought so many of the things from back east that 

103.36 105.56 B: we now have all kinds of allergies out here 

105.58 107.07 A: exactly 

106.05 106.73 B: [cough]

107.61 108.70 B: (( [cough] )) 

109.80 112.99 A: i forgot those second part of that question 

113.24 114.20 B: um 

114.35 115.40 B: (( so did i )) 

115.88 120.62 B: the basic part was do you think most people would panic i think that's about the only part 

118.71 120.86 A: (( okay [laughter] yeah )) 

120.77 122.09 B: (( of the thing i heard )) 

120.90 122.17 A: yeah 

122.36 130.90 A: yeah i think i mean i think most of the people will i see we live near a wright patt have you ever heard of wright patt air force base 

131.42 133.02 B: no i haven't but 

132.81 135.76 A: [noise] we live near there so it's i'm 

136.55 137.50 A: (( on the phone )) 

138.71 140.12 A: go ahead fix what you need 

140.36 141.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

141.50 155.73 A: so we live near a um very major air force base where the wright brothers you know came up with their flights and stuff so we live really near there so a lot of people here like um like the is very near wright patt 

147.45 148.61 B: oh okay 

149.69 150.44 B: (( uh-uh )) 

155.73 157.60 A: so a lot of people panic 

157.62 158.64 B: right 

158.06 163.76 A: you know it's an ordinary air force base wondering if since we're a major air force base whether we would get hit or not 

164.08 166.31 B: right i can understand that um 

166.40 171.14 B: i live close to one that used to be a major air base but they've closed it down now 

171.25 174.36 B: and so it's not so much of a you know a 

175.46 177.92 B: detriment i guess you'd call it 

177.35 178.29 A: right 

179.33 180.49 B: it's still 

180.89 186.93 B: you know they might not realize that it's a closed down base because there's a lot of activity that goes on there 

187.32 188.40 A: that's true 

187.42 188.61 B: and that you 

188.77 190.93 B: know that's something to think about plus 

191.31 194.58 B: i'm south of a small airport by about a mile 

194.79 196.31 A: oh wow yeah 

196.33 199.70 A: yeah we're a little further from an airport but 

199.82 202.46 A: i know it has stopped with all this 

203.42 208.76 A: um with the airplanes and stuff like that and i i do not feel safe in a plane 

209.26 210.53 A: i don't fly 

211.23 212.81 B: you know that's the thing that 

211.93 212.95 A: (( since )) 

213.39 217.94 A: all this has gone on 'cause i heard they can put their chemicals in the planes too now 

217.37 218.15 B: (( uh-uh )) 

218.47 219.38 A: so 

219.72 221.30 B: you know that's something that 

219.85 221.23 A: that's made me a little 

221.72 223.29 A: a little paranoid 

223.18 226.83 B: will yeah i can i can guess it would i hadn't heard that myself 

226.56 227.76 A: (( oh okay )) 

226.99 229.32 B: and i'm still flying 

229.21 231.68 A: oh you are that's good for you 

230.17 231.26 B: oh yeah 

231.79 235.55 A: 'cause um i've got last time i flew is when i 

236.10 239.33 A: my son was born and this is about seven years ago 

239.41 242.64 A: and we actually went to las vegas so that's kind of near you 

241.69 242.61 B: (( uh-uh )) 

242.68 243.57 B: right 

243.71 246.68 B: yes it's about a six hour drive from me if i drive 

246.46 251.31 A: oh that would be great i wish i lived that close [laughter] 

250.40 256.19 B: well you know ah i don't really go to vegas that often we go to places i prefer to go 

253.94 254.85 A: (( uh-uh )) 

255.93 259.65 A: right i mean that's like i liked it for just the weekend 

259.93 260.74 B: (( uh-uh )) 

260.11 264.24 A: but not like that i they said las vegas was the next one 

264.62 265.52 A: so 

265.54 266.61 B: (( um )) 

265.81 269.09 A: that they were thinking would that would have a bioterrorism 

269.09 272.01 B: well why would they well i guess maybe because 

270.64 276.67 A: because they think it's a sin city and they're supposed to be and these people are supposed to be so religious 

273.06 273.89 B: (( uh-uh )) 

276.25 277.29 B: right 

277.47 280.44 A: um that's just hearsay i don't know 

277.81 278.58 B: well 

280.90 283.06 B: i haven't heard that either because 

283.83 287.65 B: you know i guess i kind of tune out some of this stuff because i figure 

287.93 290.16 B: i can't do anything about it anyway 

289.92 291.19 A: exactly 

290.31 292.97 B: so there's no sense worrying about it 

293.15 297.53 A: right and that's i have to two small children and i watch um 

297.99 301.13 A: i watch on the news where um they have um 

301.63 304.07 A: where people dug out you know like 

304.52 306.66 A: hideaway places and stuff 

306.35 307.38 B: (( uh-uh )) 

307.43 308.55 A: and um 

308.76 315.93 A: i have got a little anxiety to that point and i'm like no what am i doing you know if it's my turn it's my turn you know [noise] 

314.93 315.88 B: right 

316.12 317.45 A: i'm sorry 

318.15 319.17 A: and um 

319.90 323.18 A: so but i in the fifties i think they did that 

323.02 326.57 B: yeah i can remember 'cause i'm back from that era 

326.30 327.40 A: okay 

327.19 328.10 B: (( and )) 

328.22 330.96 B: i can remember the bomb shelters and everybody 

330.13 332.02 A: yeah 

331.05 333.92 B: you know but my folks never went into that 

333.89 337.16 A: oh okay well thank god it didn't come to that 

336.94 340.36 B: right and i guess they figured the basement was going to have to do 

340.70 346.29 B: and you know we never had the problem and we were twenty five miles from an air force base 

347.96 349.97 B: so i mean we had that in fact 

349.98 361.66 B: i had moved away from there in i was in a city and i couldn't figure out what was there was something about the city i kept missing i couldn't think what it was and i finally realised that it was the flying of the airplanes 

356.82 357.66 A: (( uh-uh )) 

361.78 364.78 B: you know because we'd hear the jets and stuff 

363.27 364.55 A: (( oh okay )) 

365.29 368.64 A: we have heard a lot of airplanes flying low right now too 

368.56 369.63 B: right 

370.16 371.11 B: yeah they 

370.18 374.57 A: 'cause we're near the air force base but they were doing a lot of training in our area 

374.24 375.17 B: (( uh-uh )) 

375.64 377.18 A: for war 

377.10 378.28 B: yes see the 

378.08 379.38 A: that made me nervous 

379.51 381.98 B: yes that would um 

381.04 382.07 A: definitely 

382.37 385.54 B: out here um well before they shut down williams 

385.62 393.63 B: um they were doing some of the checking some testing some of the planes [noise] and one of the planes that i saw before it was ever 

395.10 397.47 B: unveiled was the stealth fighter 

397.76 402.29 B: they were flying it one morning i was going to work and i saw that that stealth fighter 

402.82 404.07 A: oh wow 

402.90 410.58 B: stealth plane it was kind of neat and i go boy i haven't seen that one that's different and then about shortly after about a week later they showed it on t._v. 

411.73 413.97 A: oh wow that's interesting 

413.94 420.04 B: yeah and i was really sorry to see that base close 'cause you know it had a lot of um 

421.14 422.12 B: um 

422.27 424.20 B: employment for the east valley 

423.48 425.33 A: [noise] oh i bet 

425.81 426.53 B: (( so )) 

426.15 428.11 A: i've heard a lot of people um 

428.46 430.25 A: go to arizona for their 

431.28 432.20 B: yeah 

431.74 435.33 A: and um we've been wanting to go out west for a long time 

435.47 440.44 A: but my husband won't fly so it would be a driving situation 

440.35 441.53 B: yeah and that can 

440.73 442.62 A: and that's a long haul 

442.87 444.13 A: from ohio

492.14 493.33 B: oh okay 

492.61 495.01 A: like they would tell us when the ten minutes are up 

495.28 499.60 B: all right i guess i didn't hear that i wasn't paying that close of attention 

498.83 504.37 A: you know it's so funny i told 'em i couldn't do it because i usually have to be work at five 

504.14 505.08 B: (( uh-uh )) 

504.69 507.91 A: and they said and the lady called me at home today 

507.94 509.89 A: to make sure i wanted to do it 

510.20 511.44 B: oh really 

511.01 514.63 A: yeah from two to five and then i just happened to answer the phone 

514.94 517.87 A: and i mean i just got registered today 

517.97 519.07 B: oh really 

518.47 520.07 A: isn't that strange 

519.62 522.31 B: yeah i got registered oh a couple of days ago 

521.99 523.38 A: yeah 

522.33 523.94 B: (( and then )) 

524.45 527.90 B: well in fact i think it was yesterday maybe the day before they called me 

528.19 529.81 B: on my cell phone 

529.58 530.47 A: (( uh-uh )) 

530.21 531.18 B: (( and )) 

530.94 533.65 A: they wanted to know if i had a cell phone i said no 

533.61 538.10 B: well in fact i'm talking to you on my cell phone now and i was surprised that this phone rang 

537.97 539.28 A: (( oh okay )) 

538.95 544.05 B: because um it was kind of out of service i lost my other one 

543.81 544.82 A: okay 

544.15 554.74 B: and i know where i lost it ah and they're doing a lot of construction and i had to go up there to get the mail and i had to you know sneak under a barricade to get to my mailbox and i know when i 

553.72 554.74 A: (( oh wow )) 

554.70 559.42 B: bent over that's when i lost the phone but of course they don't 

557.05 558.27 A: oh my goodness 

559.49 561.82 B: when i went up there nobody knew anything 

561.58 562.74 A: exactly 

562.50 567.63 B: so i had to cancel it right away because i think there might be a couple of calls to mexico on it 

567.98 568.97 A: (( oh oh )) 

568.62 573.23 B: and so anyway um i had a message on my voice mail 

573.33 576.23 B: that they could reach me on my temporary cell phone 

576.45 581.18 B: and she called me on that the other day and that's why when this one rang i thought who's calling 

581.08 581.86 A: (( i know )) 

581.88 588.82 A: actually my son answered it and he said it's from some university i said okay he's only five 

588.73 589.93 B: (( uh-uh )) 

589.09 594.71 A: he's like it's somebody at the university i'm like oh and then i get on the phone and i heard the recording 

595.13 598.64 A: but it's not bad i don't think it's um
