13.96 17.26 B: okay um i like comedy but 

17.48 21.16 B: most of the comedy clubs i've ever been to have been pretty raunchy 

21.48 23.86 A: i agree 

21.98 22.98 B: i mean 

24.34 26.24 B: you know there but there's one over here 

27.27 29.54 B: i live in santa clara california 

29.64 30.15 A: mhm 

30.20 32.28 B: and there's a thing called comedy sport 

32.72 33.21 A: mhm 

33.61 38.69 B: and eh it's really great they have um it's clean comedy it's (( billed )) for the family 

38.93 40.27 A: oh okay 

40.66 44.05 B: and i ran into them at the county fair several years ago 

45.06 45.72 A: okay 

45.35 45.76 B: and 

46.78 49.83 B: i really liked it i mean it's comical and 

49.95 50.62 B: it's funny 

51.12 57.61 A: well that's good uh let's see around here i'm from louisville kentucky so there's not that many comedy clubs 

57.71 59.29 A: but most of it typically is 

59.79 65.02 A: kind of raunchy unless they brought in a you know maybe a woman comedian some of those are 

65.42 66.33 A: not so bad 

66.85 67.36 A: um 

67.57 68.24 A: but it's kind of 

69.29 78.19 A: kind of hard to find clean comedy or maybe they sh- sometimes you need to separate the women's comedy from the men's comedy so you don't have to listen to some of that 

77.27 81.83 B: yeah i i think uh most of the men do like it on the raunchy side 

81.96 83.91 A: yeah there's limits to how many 

84.18 90.05 A: cuss words and poker jokes (( i guess )) that you can hear 

89.88 91.87 B: well i ha- like i said i 

92.40 93.93 B: you know it's but a lot of them 

94.08 96.95 B: my granddaughter use to really like
