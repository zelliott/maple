206.37 208.51 B: and they do this routine with a dentist 

209.09 213.94 B: and tim conway is the dentist and he is trying to give harvey korman's uh novacaine shot 

214.61 216.80 B: and it's hysterical like he is missing 

216.94 217.57 B: um 

217.98 227.64 B: missing his mouth and he gives himself the novacaine shot in the leg or arm or something and all of a sudden his arm is just dangling there -cause he can't feel anything

241.72 242.60 B: terribly funny 

242.72 243.41 B: so um 

243.94 244.57 B: it is 

244.81 248.48 B: people that want to make money losing money on a play 

249.68 250.57 B: and

256.76 266.64 A: that doesn't no that doesn't sound that funny what about written humor do you like like i really like sometimes dave barry like sometimes i don't like him sometimes i think he is obnoxious but sometimes he is pretty funny 

258.86 259.53 B: um 

267.07 270.31 A: i probably like written humor more than like t._v. humor and 

270.57 270.84 B: (( sure )) 

270.62 271.09 A: and stuff 

272.02 273.96 B: i'm sorry i couldn't hear you what kind of humor

306.20 307.52 A: no they're really not 

309.16 314.18 A: they are pretty i mean they are always some part of the funniness is that they are mean to people or i mean 

313.87 317.41 B: making fun or people or or something like that 

317.87 318.60 A: yeah 

319.33 319.89 B: um

338.31 339.36 B: you know um 

339.81 341.95 B: uh the books i read are more mysteries 

342.43 344.06 B: just because i enjoy them 

344.18 344.82 B: um 

345.33 346.83 B: to me it's an escape 

348.03 349.91 A: yeah i like reading mysteries too 

350.42 356.96 A: especially like the kind of like the junky ones that are just lien fun to read but they are not particularly intellectual 

358.15 359.96 B: have you ever read any stewart woods 

360.30 361.67 A: no i haven't 

361.83 364.93 B: you should read some of his his are fun they are light reading and 

365.03 367.78 B: you know you don't have to be a rocket scientist to read -em 

368.24 369.10 B: um 

369.38 372.44 B: but they've got good plots and they've got good twists in -em 

373.08 375.36 B: um there is one called (( )) 

375.70 378.17 B: and that was one of the first ones i've read of his 

378.65 381.24 B: see if you can get it at the library it's really good 

381.30 383.89 A: okay i'll have to look that up that's 

383.44 383.96 B: yeah 

384.60 386.01 A: that sounds interesting 

386.07 388.94 B: it really is um and it takes place on a 

389.05 394.88 B: uh island off the coast of georgia well i live in georgia so to me that was really 

395.36 396.30 B: extra special 

396.54 397.14 B: you know 

396.73 397.44 A: yeah 

397.90 398.24 B: so 

398.86 399.99 B: this is kind of weird 

400.36 402.12 B: trying to talk to somebody for ten minutes 

402.28 403.18 B: that you don't know 

403.43 406.95 A: yeah it is kind of a weird thing but 

407.06 409.75 A: i just you know i said i might as well try it 

409.90 411.76 A: see what it is like but 

410.18 410.55 B: (( )) 

411.14 411.74 B: that's what i 

412.00 412.48 B: too 

413.75 419.44 A: but it is different especially if they just give you a topic like oh talk about comedy you know 

419.56 419.91 B: (( )) 

419.57 420.08 A: and it's 

420.24 420.63 B: about 

420.26 420.62 A: it's 

420.89 424.54 B: draw the line over what is acceptable and what's not 

424.30 425.11 A: yeah 

425.21 429.59 A: i think that (( )) barry is for everyone but 

429.97 432.82 B: i i agree i think it depends a lot on your upbringing 

433.20 434.89 B: like uh some dumb jo- 

435.24 436.06 B: blonde jokes 

436.51 437.73 B: i think are very funny 

438.19 439.30 B: but i'm not a blonde 

439.92 440.74 A: yeah 

440.08 440.40 B: not 

440.60 442.80 B: i don't know how a blonde feels about them 

443.96 444.59 B: you know 

444.80 445.79 A: yeah 

445.80 446.33 B: um 

448.01 453.58 B: but i mean they could be for anybody you know you could change it from dumb blonde to dumb something else but then 

453.71 456.97 B: you you know are you stereotyping and are you you know 

458.38 458.65 B: um 

487.19 487.80 B: oh 

490.89 491.41 B: i think probably 

491.05 492.12 A: as other people 

492.47 493.92 B: he probably heard it from his 

494.23 495.32 B: big brother or his 

495.51 497.11 B: father or somebody you know 

497.24 499.24 A: oh i'm sure he did 

498.71 500.66 B: did you see my big fat greek wedding 

500.91 502.22 A: no i haven't 

502.47 504.73 B: okay well that makes fun of 

505.52 509.63 B: greek families but the thing is i'm jewish and i can relate to it 

509.80 510.73 B: you know 

511.09 515.39 B: so it could've been a greek family or a jewish family or a catholic family or a 

515.56 518.50 B: you know italian family or anything um 

519.10 525.66 B: it it's just the way families react but i can see maybe where somebody would get a little offended by that 

525.73 526.52 A: yeah 

527.13 528.40 A: that makes sense 

529.01 529.50 B: um 

529.76 530.60 B: but it was funny 

531.87 533.19 A: i'm sure it was
