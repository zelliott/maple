7.78 8.17 B: hello 

9.03 11.55 A: hi well this is vicky and 

12.23 14.86 A: and i think that i would be terrified 

15.83 16.50 A: and uh 

15.91 16.58 B: yeah well 

18.44 22.59 B: terrorism huh i i got to be honest i didn't hear everything that that prompt said 

22.87 24.70 A: oh it said how would you react 

25.62 26.84 B: to a terrorist attack right now 

26.80 27.27 A: yeah 

28.16 29.37 B: yeah i would probably freak out 

29.62 30.09 A: yeah 

30.31 33.53 B: i have a lot of friends in the military right now and i don't think i would be too happy about it 

34.01 39.93 A: oh yeah well i have no one the mari- military but i i live in baytown texas i don't know if you're familiar 

40.66 41.84 B: yeah we're only in san antonio 

42.38 42.84 A: oh really 

42.76 43.07 B: yeah 

43.03 47.02 A: oh okay well i'm right here around all all these chemical plants and 

43.26 44.85 B: yeah so i know there's a lot of 

47.28 49.51 A: everybody's always talking about that they may 

47.81 48.26 B: oh 

50.13 52.17 A: you know hit one of the chemical plants so 

53.06 53.54 B: well 

53.16 54.65 A: that's uh that's a fear of mine 

55.01 58.40 B: i don't know i'm i'm really more worried about what's going to happen when uh 

59.61 68.48 B: i mean if if something does happen what will happen to my friends that are over there right now especially the ones who don't really want to be there they're kind of forced to be over there cause they signed up six years ago 

63.17 64.36 A: yeah that's true 

68.63 70.99 A: oh yeah then they're they're just not (( )) yeah 

71.38 71.70 B: yeah 

71.43 72.63 A: i can see how that yeah 

72.84 74.50 A: i understand how many people do you have 

75.54 81.50 B: indirectly yeah i mean i think they have too many people over there as it is right now and i think they all need to come home cause 

79.08 79.42 A: yeah 

82.11 83.09 B: you know i mean 

83.35 84.12 B: uh 

84.25 88.09 B: i think we probably did something wrong to piss somebody else off excuse my language i'm sorry 

88.58 89.98 B: i'm a i'm a true texan so 

90.63 92.07 B: i don't know i think that 

95.46 98.99 B: i don't know i think one was enough force but if it happened again i wouldn't be halfway surprised 

99.34 99.95 A: yeah 

100.51 101.04 A: well 

102.05 104.07 A: i don't know what um in 

104.66 108.06 A: with this thing i know i think we're supposed to talk for like eight minutes or something like that 

108.45 109.29 B: something like that 

109.03 111.43 A: does it c- does it automatically is this your first survey 

111.98 112.65 B: yeah yeah 

112.83 115.17 A: mine too i don't know if it 

114.60 115.25 B: oh how convenient 

115.58 118.71 A: uh yeah i don't know if it clicks off or whatever but um 

116.61 117.52 B: i don't 

119.17 122.28 A: anyway back to terroris- -rism thing i think it's 

122.39 125.66 A: think about all the people that you know got killed in oklahoma and 

126.32 127.17 A: stuff like that and 

127.82 128.81 A: i really hope that 

129.41 131.22 A: everything could stop before we have 

131.31 132.86 A: have a war and all that 

133.35 133.79 B: yeah 

133.91 138.20 B: well i mean as far as as all that's going on with saddam and all them right now 

137.92 138.35 A: mhm 

138.60 141.19 B: i think we should just back away and mind our own business 

141.51 142.27 A: i do too 

142.65 144.21 A: i i definitely agree on that 

145.24 146.25 A: i i do too 

146.93 148.08 B: so i mean yeah you know they 

148.30 150.29 B: i i realize that we went to war with them 

150.20 150.62 A: mhm 

150.57 151.08 B: you know 

151.53 154.49 B: but uh well a long time ago not that long i guess 

154.90 156.25 B: i realize that we went to war with them 

156.47 156.86 A: mhm 

156.61 157.83 B: and we didn't really 

158.21 161.09 B: have much closure to that but i think that having 

161.41 163.95 B: you know starting a new a new problem with them is not the way to go 

164.78 165.60 B: especially (( now cause )) 

165.96 169.32 B: i i i am i am n- a strong of getting bush out of office 

169.40 169.97 B: so 

169.59 170.96 A: oh my goodness me too 

171.60 175.93 A: me too and i you know i i that's what i i was telling mary and i was telling my husband 

176.28 177.35 A: i kind of fig- figure he's 

177.53 180.74 A: just taking up where his dad left off for this war thing and all that 

181.14 182.05 B: yeah yeah 

181.37 182.17 A: it seems like 

182.29 182.92 A: you know 

183.05 189.14 A: i don't know if you're a democrat or a republican but seem like every time we have a republican president it's it's something about a war 

189.64 191.21 B: well i kind of have to be a democrat 

191.64 193.85 B: cause i i really can't agree with any of this war stuff 

191.65 192.18 A: yeah 

194.01 194.77 A: right 

194.34 197.73 B: i'm not i'm not exactly anti war but i'm not exactly pro war either 

197.47 198.00 A: yeah 

198.18 203.95 B: i mean if there's a really good reason i think we should go to war for it but as far as it goes right now i mean you know gas prices are up right now 

203.51 204.93 A: oh my goodness yes 

204.07 207.56 B: like som- we can't even afford to go to work [noise] we can't even afford to put gas in our car 

208.48 208.88 B: and uh 

209.08 210.34 A: oh man 

210.42 213.30 B: yeah it's ver- you know i just think it's absolutely ridiculous 

211.26 216.15 A: yeah i know cause i filled my car up ah i uh day before yesterday and it was like twenty five bucks so 

217.11 219.57 A: and i have a little you know my car is not that big 

220.06 222.32 B: yeah well mine is i've got an exterra so it's huge 

222.63 223.25 A: oh really 

223.54 223.92 B: yeah 

225.26 226.34 B: um i don't know it 

226.43 228.62 B: terrorism right okay so 

229.18 230.33 B: uh 

229.23 233.71 A: yeah and and then uh you you know uh the fact that we don't even have to worry about 

233.92 237.46 A: just the bombing and stuff like that like they did you know a long time ago 

237.88 238.82 A: you have to worry 

238.10 239.78 B: yeah it wouldn't even be bombings though it it 

239.93 244.69 B: exactly it would it would be something i didn't mean to interrupt you i'm sorry i'm very (( )) 

242.64 243.42 A: y- yes 

243.80 245.08 A: chemicals uh yeah 

245.27 247.89 B: exactly yeah it would be the chemicals that would scare me 

246.05 248.63 A: like that anthrax and all that yeah mhm 

248.87 249.28 A: yeah 

249.66 252.37 A: you don't know if you you know if you should drink water or you know 

252.81 256.32 A: it could you know get you in all all kinds of ways so i don't know 

252.88 253.45 B: yeah 

256.81 258.00 B: i don't know i i mean 

258.46 263.14 B: i know they they've been they said that there might be threats against apartment buildings and things like that and 

263.30 268.45 B: they uh my apartment complex actually came out and said keep in mind that it wasn't any specific threat against any specific complex but 

268.51 268.94 A: mhm 

269.28 271.92 B: you know it's never a good thing to go out and kill thousands of people 

273.10 273.87 B: something they didn't 

274.44 277.48 B: specifically do i think if you're really going to be pissed off about it go to the source 

277.71 278.19 A: yeah 

281.86 282.44 B: (( i don't know )) 

281.92 284.20 A: yeah not i'd i i i agree with that 

284.83 286.99 B: (( )) why punish everybody else 

285.55 285.91 A: so 

288.69 289.21 A: yeah 

290.40 294.51 A: so i d- i know i don't know i i i've listened to a lot of um radio 

295.06 295.70 A: um 

296.19 297.96 A: you know topics and stuff like that 

298.16 298.50 B: right 

299.28 300.24 A: to tr- you know and 

300.62 302.56 A: try to see where everybody ev- you know if i'm 

302.88 304.77 A: aware i don't think we're we're definitely not 

304.98 306.86 A: the only ones that feel this way 

306.58 307.01 B: (( well i know )) 

307.58 309.13 B: i kind of think we're taking on more than 

309.31 309.77 B: you know 

309.89 311.77 B: biting off more than we can chew right now 

312.29 313.87 B: you know with iraq and 

314.22 314.61 B: uh 

314.85 317.61 B: north korea or south korea whichever one it is 

318.77 319.77 B: considering the fact that 

319.93 321.78 B: most of the u._n. doesn't agree with us 

322.49 322.92 A: yeah 

323.05 323.52 B: (( i mean )) 

324.07 325.09 B: you know we might be a big 

325.29 328.95 B: free country but that doesn't mean anything when it comes down to this kind of thing 

329.26 329.68 B: you know 

329.91 332.09 B: nobody says we're going to be a big free country forever 

332.50 333.21 A: that's true 

333.75 334.68 A: that is very true 

336.63 340.97 B: all it takes is one really pissed off person to come over here and screw us all over 

340.67 344.13 A: yeah that's true 

344.51 348.50 B: not to mention that if we do if we do go to war right now i have a friend here from england 

348.59 349.01 A: uh huh 

348.59 350.28 B: he just got here yesterday and uh 

350.47 354.51 B: and if we go to war if we have another terrorist attack right now british airways will not fly him home 

355.15 356.11 B: and he's going to be stuck here 

356.56 357.50 A: oh wow 

358.97 360.90 B: so which you know wouldn't be that bad 

361.28 362.11 B: but 

362.24 363.80 B: cause we really enjoy his company but 

364.01 365.96 B: it he he would not be able to go home 

366.40 367.88 B: until he could get the money for another fl- 

368.11 373.91 B: for another flight and british airways i think is the only one that will fly him back to england and they said that if we go to war or 

374.30 375.80 B: or you know there's any kind of a terrorist 

376.51 379.42 B: um strike or anything like that they won't fly they won't fly anybody 

380.35 382.84 B: they won't take his money anymore they're going to completely stop all flights 

383.51 384.91 B: so i think it's absolutely ridiculous 

383.57 383.97 A: yeah 

385.07 385.68 B: i think we n- 

385.82 387.13 B: need to back out now 

387.25 389.93 B: i think bush needs to realize exactly what he's doing to everybody 

390.90 391.36 A: yeah 

391.06 391.96 B: and stop being such a 

392.32 394.06 B: prick for lack of a better word 

394.41 394.88 A: yeah 

395.31 396.07 A: uh yeah 

396.23 397.35 A: i i agree with you 

398.49 406.23 A: i know that that flying thing i uh uh when they uh you know when uh the nine eleven deal i mean i remember i we were getting ready to take a 

406.34 407.32 A: trip to vegas 

407.76 408.13 B: mhm 

407.83 413.27 A: and you know i just cancelled the whole thing i was so scared you know i there was no way i was going to get on an airplane so 

413.74 415.81 B: yeah well m- my uncle was actually in 

416.14 416.63 B: um 

416.95 421.45 B: he was in new york that day and he was supposed to go with his foster child to go to 

421.89 427.18 B: the uh the world trade centers and he didn't get there though because he they missed the very last train that was going to take them there 

427.33 427.78 A: uh huh 

428.30 430.91 B: and if he had if he hadn't missed that train he would have been on 

431.04 431.47 B: you know 

431.84 433.97 B: whatever that observation deck is he would have been 

431.93 433.02 A: wow 

434.11 435.03 B: down with the rest of them 

435.35 435.99 A: yeah 

435.57 437.00 B: so that really did kind of hit home 

437.67 438.32 A: wow 

437.86 440.12 B: besides the fact that i'm just pissed off about it 

440.33 441.44 B: but uh 

441.72 442.11 B: i don't know 

442.53 443.88 B: if we have another terrorist 

444.03 445.48 B: threat though i'm willing to bet 

445.69 446.96 B: that we're going to have another thing like 

447.08 450.97 B: like in world war two with all the concentration camps cause there are so many people who are full of hatred 

452.08 454.01 B: and who say that you know anybody who's of 

454.11 454.45 B: of 

454.91 459.16 B: you know middle eastern descent is just evil and (( spot )) of the devil and 

459.44 459.86 B: and uh 

460.35 463.08 B: you know cause the u._s. is actually trying to come out with a stamp right now that 

463.59 464.22 B: that will 

464.63 465.25 B: commemorate 

465.47 469.92 B: muslims muslim holidays and i've heard so much smack about it from people who say that 

470.23 474.82 B: you know why should why should we commemorate their holidays they're terrorists they bomb everybody 

474.97 477.04 A: right i yeah 

475.04 475.68 B: but 

476.09 483.75 B: well exactly exactly i mean i i thought that come to find out it's actually the woman who told me that i was actually related to somehow but she's a 

483.16 483.83 A: oh yeah 

484.36 486.11 B: i didn't know that at the time but 

486.22 486.87 B: she's uh 

488.00 489.22 B: absolute full of hatred 

489.33 490.25 B: i mean you know 

491.07 491.76 B: statistics 

491.93 493.02 B: statistically 

493.74 497.30 B: you know jut as many muslims and and hindus and whatever will die 

497.95 498.47 B: when 

498.73 499.22 B: you know 

499.48 500.33 A: yeah that's true 

500.57 503.26 B: more than americans will there was a lot of 

501.58 502.23 A: mhm 

503.38 504.68 B: there was a lot of muslims 

505.21 506.26 B: in the world trade towers 

506.97 507.43 A: yeah 

507.45 512.22 B: you know i mean they they come out they're our doctors and our our lawyers you know and they do a damn good job 

512.05 512.60 A: mhm 

512.95 514.30 B: so i think it's just really stupid that 

514.78 515.24 A: yeah 

516.16 519.43 A: yeah they don't well you know they don't care who they kill because um
