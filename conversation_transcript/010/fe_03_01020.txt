40.32 41.12 A: pretty well 

41.39 46.60 A: made myself you know aware of what could happen and what to do if it does happen 

50.89 52.57 B: depends on how close to home it was 

52.95 53.35 A: mm 

53.10 54.91 B: and what kind of attack it was 

55.36 55.82 A: mm 

55.64 56.22 B: hum

82.25 82.72 B: if it was 

83.04 83.89 B: biological 

84.71 85.09 A: mm 

86.08 87.01 B: you know especially 

86.29 88.13 A: as opposed to huh 

89.41 90.08 A: nuclear 

91.55 95.40 B: well that yea i don't think i would have time to get scared 

94.69 95.84 A: well that's true 

95.95 96.67 B: yea 

96.99 98.45 B: it would be pretty quick

102.26 102.73 A: mm 

102.81 103.75 B: so you know

106.93 107.97 B: especially the biological 

108.19 108.56 B: were 

108.86 112.05 B: i wouldn't i would be helpless to do anything for her 

113.53 116.59 B: you know we can think they sit there and talk about small pox and 

116.97 118.19 B: you have a medical 

118.32 120.91 B: addition where i read that you know that it's even worse 

121.79 128.19 B: for me to get vaccinated if you know if it were to come to that cause i heard that they were going to do mandatory vaccination 

128.38 128.94 A: mm 

128.91 130.53 B: if at some point they're thinking of it 

131.84 132.47 B: so hum 

132.84 135.79 B: i don't know cause it's kind of right now it's an intangible 

136.91 137.48 B: because

147.41 147.87 B: hum 

148.45 150.67 B: made changes you know since nine eleven 

151.16 152.40 B: you know i'm not still 

152.88 155.72 B: i'm not a hundred percent that they are going to catch everything but 

156.05 157.91 B: they're catching a lot more than they were before 

158.33 158.76 A: right 

161.19 161.78 A: hum 

162.92 163.60 A: yea i think 

164.03 167.96 A: huh the public in general is staying fairly calm 

168.55 169.09 B: mm 

169.66 170.35 A: hum 

170.80 176.50 A: i know a lot of people are preparing you know making sure they have a lot of water on hand 

177.19 180.22 A: you know the necessary essentials on hand in case 

181.06 182.41 A: you know that we have too 

182.80 184.29 A: confine ourselves 

185.28 186.23 A: in a room 

186.67 187.18 B: mm 

186.69 188.67 A: you know for a couple of days or what ever 

189.24 191.34 B: you know how we haven't even done anything like that 

191.92 192.41 B: have you 

192.10 192.73 A: well i mean 

192.98 196.32 A: well i've i've huh made sure i have water on hand 

196.70 197.28 B: huh huh 

197.40 199.46 A: and that's probably about it 

200.05 202.18 A: well because i i read that 

202.62 203.85 A: you know if they do hum 

204.46 206.99 A: like chemical war fare 

207.57 208.07 A: huh 

208.66 213.30 A: a lot of times those agents dissipate so quickly in the air 

213.72 214.47 A: that if you 

213.82 214.29 B: mm 

214.64 215.91 A: see or smell something 

216.05 217.72 A: that if you just walk away 

218.01 219.62 A: from the area quickly 

220.38 221.84 A: you know that you won't be affected 

222.56 223.90 B: right now i can see that 

224.29 225.02 B: because hum 

224.70 225.12 A: yea 

225.32 226.54 B: it gets dispersed 

226.70 228.64 B: you know and and it's less potent and everything 

226.96 227.38 A: right 

228.91 230.93 A: yea it's yea and just make sure your not 

231.15 231.79 A: you know your 

232.42 233.53 A: not 

233.73 235.69 A: down wind or up wind or what ever 

236.07 236.80 B: right 

237.91 238.46 A: hum 

239.41 244.05 A: but i mean so if it's something small like that course that's going to be like huh 

245.22 245.96 A: a hum 

246.85 247.69 A: low dose 

248.63 249.11 A: hum 

250.27 252.29 A: area you know somebody just pulling 

252.98 257.77 A: a prank or got to be a prank or a terroristic attach in like a mall or something like that 

258.26 258.64 B: right 

259.13 260.05 A: but if it's 

259.50 259.80 B: right 

260.32 261.80 A: oh where they're 

262.60 264.82 A: so i put some in our water system 

265.30 266.58 A: you know that's that's something 

267.91 269.09 A: totally different 

269.38 269.91 B: mm 

270.28 274.70 B: that would be kind of you know you just you don't know because i've even read things where 

274.98 276.41 B: you know they can sit there and 

276.55 278.46 B: you know if they wanted to get into like you know 

278.85 280.77 B: cereal plants or something like that and 

280.53 281.03 A: mm 

281.22 282.78 B: to high of a dosage of like you know 

281.43 282.09 A: mm 

283.15 287.93 B: some kind of vitamin or something and then you know people are eating cereal they don't know they don't have any clue 

288.14 290.13 A: right you don't have no clue yea 

290.33 290.81 B: mm 

290.89 292.62 A: i mean there are so many different ways 

293.10 294.25 A: that they could 

295.81 296.43 A: hum 

297.90 300.15 A: you know know get into our water or 

300.24 300.53 A: our 

301.03 302.27 A: food or 

303.16 305.20 A: you know that we wouldn't have any idea 

305.64 306.15 B: mm 

306.41 309.01 A: what was going on we wouldn't know how to protect our selves 

310.04 312.02 A: and what to do if we were infected 

312.63 314.62 B: and i get worried with l._a. being 

314.82 315.86 B: such a major city 

316.73 317.41 A: mm 

316.98 317.67 B: that it 

317.99 319.60 B: makes it more probable 

320.07 321.03 B: of a target 

321.54 321.93 A: right 

323.58 326.42 A: well here you know in phoenix i mean i live maybe 

327.78 329.75 A: oh forty miles from (( palo verde )) 

330.41 331.51 A: which is the largest 

330.53 331.06 B: mm 

331.63 333.04 A: nuclear reactor 

333.25 334.69 A: in the western hemisphere 

333.45 333.79 B: oh 

335.58 336.17 B: oh so 

336.54 339.06 A: so 

336.70 340.88 B: your not in the much better position than i am 

340.24 342.95 A: so you know what if they decide to 

343.12 346.04 A: attack (( palo verde )) well there's nothing i can do 

346.51 347.19 B: right now the 

347.56 348.00 B: true 

348.39 349.26 B: that's true i mean 

349.66 350.91 B: that's probably the hum 

352.22 354.50 B: i don't know it's like i don't spend my days 

355.37 356.37 B: worrying about it 

356.77 357.69 A: no i don't either 

356.78 357.79 B: i i do 

358.03 359.01 B: sit there and hum 

359.87 360.99 B: wonder if you know 

361.48 362.92 B: if we end up going to war 

363.66 364.22 A: mm 

364.48 364.95 B: you know 

365.42 365.81 B: what's 

365.45 368.15 A: oh that prospect scares me more than 

365.95 367.45 B: going to happen over here 

369.13 371.20 A: that's what's more scary if we go to war 

372.16 373.22 B: so but then i 

372.63 373.36 A: that's that's 

374.31 377.43 A: yea but then you know if we go to war then there going to 

377.76 379.12 A: want to retaliate 

380.18 382.13 B: so but then on the other hand i mean i 

380.89 381.39 A: you know 

382.47 383.10 B: i 

383.98 386.47 B: i wish there was a peaceful resolution but i don't 

386.80 387.82 B: see it happening 

388.11 389.02 A: yea 

388.16 388.58 B: i don't 

388.68 389.63 B: i don't trust 

390.67 391.74 B: hussein and 

391.80 392.79 A: oh no i'm 

393.05 394.85 A: mm no body should trust him 

393.70 396.74 B: you know i mean if it comes down to you know 

397.95 399.49 B: war is the only way 

399.76 400.84 A: mm 

399.83 402.36 B: that's the only thing i sit there and i think you know 

402.64 403.86 B: some body needs to stop him 

404.29 404.71 A: right 

404.84 406.41 B: and then you know if it's not 

407.33 408.34 B: hum if you know 

408.87 409.74 B: what am i trying to say

420.44 421.11 A: to us 

421.59 422.94 A: to be like the leader

429.59 431.95 A: you know come to people's rescue or 

432.23 433.50 A: or we're always 

433.83 436.26 A: everybody's we're like the world's baby sitter 

437.03 437.51 B: mm

454.49 455.91 A: you know towards war 

456.72 457.48 A: then hum 

458.09 458.51 A: and
