1.90 3.05 A: hello 

2.66 3.72 B: hello 

3.70 5.29 A: hi my name's melissa [laughter] 

4.92 6.63 B: hi melissa my name's tim 

7.93 8.93 B: well 

9.15 12.69 B: i don't know about this it's the first time i've ever done anything [laughter] like this 

11.37 12.52 A: me too 

13.41 18.67 B: but ah as far as terrorism goes i think um nine eleven sort of 

13.51 14.73 A: (( [laughter] )) 

18.83 23.19 B: opened a lot of people's eyes as to what they would do and what they would 

23.26 26.06 B: look for if something like that were to happen 

26.24 28.01 A: i think i'd probably panic 

27.67 33.59 B: yeah um yeah i was in canada when nine eleven hit and it was 

33.78 36.11 B: [mn] a little unnerving because 

36.61 39.24 B: you know [mn] there i was in a foreign country and 

39.30 45.00 B: didn't know what the status of going home was and didn't really have a good idea as to what was going on 

44.64 46.84 A: right and you still had to get back home 

46.61 48.16 B: and i still had to get back home 

47.78 50.73 A: [laughter] wow 

48.70 50.13 B: [laughter] so 

50.84 53.60 A: i was home i was just glad i didn't know anybody 

53.95 55.31 A: that was involved 

55.62 57.33 B: yeah my ah 

57.40 71.65 B: my wife she had just flown probably two or three weeks prior to that and she'd met a couple that they were [noise] going on vacation [noise] and ah he worked in the top floor of the world trade centre 

72.51 76.96 B: and ah they were an elderly couple he was getting ready for retirement and i don't know 

72.60 73.27 A: (( oh )) 

77.16 84.54 B: if he was there when it happened or or if he'd already retired or what but it was ah 

84.98 85.96 A: (( oh wow )) 

85.32 87.29 B: a little unnerving [laughter] 

86.66 88.16 A: i'd say so 

88.31 89.40 A: i haven't [noise] 

89.61 95.37 A: it had been a while since i have flown prior to that and i've been a little wary about flying since then 

95.47 103.24 B: yeah but ah i know the company my wife works for she she flew a lot and ah 

103.61 104.55 B: they 

105.00 113.75 B: they have since sort of grounded everybody and authorized people to drive rather than fly if they're uncomfortable with flying [noise] 

111.43 112.41 A: mhm 

113.32 119.49 A: exactly that's the same way it is where i work they've cut back on flights and trying to find alternatives to 

119.78 122.33 A: business travel rather than flying 

122.95 125.73 B: but ah it it seems to have worked out 

125.93 127.72 B: well because w- 

127.77 131.48 B: the time as far as tran- transport and everything 

131.52 133.78 B: the time seems to work out because 

133.88 147.32 B: you don't have to waste an hour or two at the airport going through checks and everything and no further than she have to fly that hour or two makes up the difference between the time difference in driving [laughter] so 

146.42 148.39 A: right right 

147.91 150.40 B: so it works out pretty well 

151.07 155.60 B: but i guess we've kinda gotten off topic a little bit but [laughter] 

153.81 159.38 A: [laughter] well that's still tourism i guess [laughter] and terrorism 

159.54 161.43 A: it's all related i think 

160.91 163.30 B: [laughter] yeah but um 

164.09 167.24 B: you know i i think everybody has ah 

167.74 171.43 B: gotten more of a chance to get used to 

171.84 173.32 B: not used to it but 

174.11 179.10 B: got more aware of of being prepared for something like that to happen 

179.19 180.41 A: (( right right )) 

180.01 180.99 B: and ah 

182.01 185.84 A: it's a little scary we all think it's not going to happen where we are 

186.39 191.54 A: that it's going to happen somewhere else i don't i'm not sure where you are but i'm in a small town in ohio 

191.34 193.77 B: oh okay um i'm in ah 

194.10 200.24 B: actually i'm near the ah if you're a nascar fan if you know where the lowes motor speedway is 

197.46 201.21 A: exac- mhm [noise] yep i've been there 

200.71 206.90 B: i'm standing looking at it right now because because it's my front yard [laughter] 

202.88 204.16 A: oh you're kidding 

205.27 207.95 A: oh wow [laughter] wow 

208.15 209.94 A: yeah i'm a big nascar fan 

210.06 210.98 A: um 

211.54 217.64 A: but you know being in a small town in ohio you know you think oh it's not going to happen here [mn] terrorism 

218.23 219.46 A: (( but you )) 

219.71 222.39 A: know it's usually the little places like that that 

223.34 225.09 A: where you think it's not going to happen 

225.70 226.77 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

226.88 233.70 A: hopefully it won't happen at i've even wondered like watching the races will everything anything ever happen there 

233.99 246.73 B: i know it makes you wonder i mean you stop and think about these highly publicized events like the super bowl and and things like that as to if somebody were to to dry- to try to do something during one of those 

247.09 251.79 B: would they be successful and would they be bold enough to attempt something like that 

248.45 249.80 A: (( [noise] right )) 

250.46 256.12 A: right [noise] well wasn't it just last week at one of the professional basketball games there was 

256.59 262.71 A: [noise] it ended up not being terrorism and they thought it was just a prank [noise] but something happened where everyone in the 

263.14 270.53 A: in the aren- in the [noise] stadium was gasping for air and was having problems breathing i mean they stopped the game [noise] 

270.50 271.88 B: i don't know 

270.65 274.80 A: i just i just saw a clip of it on the news i didn't get all the information 

274.71 276.49 B: (( i right )) 

275.41 281.49 A: [noise] but i mean that just shows you how easy it would be at any kind of event like that where there's a lot of people 

282.11 286.23 A: how easily they can they can harm a bunch of people at one time 

286.02 287.27 B: right 

287.41 295.26 B: no i didn't read anything about that i don't know but ah you know the the security precautions and everything they take it ah 

296.82 304.42 B: sometimes you have to wonder if it's really necessary but then you look back and say well you know the people that got on the planes that day 

304.43 305.25 A: right 

304.44 308.52 B: they didn't didn't think it was necessary they didn't think anything unusual 

308.09 309.35 A: right 

309.07 309.88 B: so 

309.99 310.97 B: just ah 

311.89 319.34 A: yeah it's unfortunate who would've ever thought that terrorists would have used used our own passenger planes as bombs basically 

319.44 333.55 B: yeah and and who's to say that you know next time if if it is a next time they may not use passenger planes they may use cargo planes because cargo planes carry the same amount of fuel and i don't know what the 

330.69 331.76 A: (( right mhm )) 

333.95 337.97 B: [sigh] the restrictions as far as passengers or as you know [mn] 

338.43 341.74 B: you know remote control or anything like that i mean 

339.63 340.68 A: mhm 

341.75 345.16 B: it's just difficult to say what what might happen 

344.08 349.34 A: and it could be something that we you know th- that hasn't even happened it could be something totally different 

348.52 350.10 B: right 

349.39 352.47 A: some other form of transportation or you know 

353.85 355.28 A: just about anything 

354.95 356.54 B: mhm 

357.74 359.31 B: (( but oh all right )) 

358.59 359.65 A: [laughter] 

362.05 371.91 B: but um it's just it's just surprising to me that the the number of people that they've gotten linked with all this terrorist activity that that they were educated in the united states 

371.69 374.96 A: oh exactly that's what and that's what's scary 

374.86 376.16 B: and you know 

376.32 382.67 B: because i'm i'm in the c- carolinas and several of the people they've ah named as being terrorists 

382.85 384.69 B: they've been in ah 

386.71 393.06 B: you know in schools here i think one of them went to north carolina state and one of them went to north carolina a and t 

388.18 389.06 A: mhm 

389.83 391.01 A: mhm 

392.66 393.66 A: mhm 

393.50 399.03 B: and you know that's just right up the road so it's hard to say what's 

396.04 396.89 A: right 

399.45 400.83 B: what's going to happen 

399.93 401.41 A: mhm 

400.88 404.09 B: or or how many of them have come through a duke or 

404.39 407.39 B: ah ohio state or anything like that 

406.08 408.39 A: right probably quite a few 

408.75 410.68 A: quite a few unfortunately [noise] 

410.54 412.21 B: yeah 

410.80 412.52 A: there was ah we even had a 

413.01 415.18 A: a gentleman here who's ah 

416.03 421.29 A: originally from that and his family are still there and they actually came in and just walked out with him one day 

421.16 421.93 B: (( mm )) 

421.51 422.46 A: nobody 

422.69 423.84 A: (( nobody knows )) 

423.85 428.25 A: why or what happened i mean he's back to work so evidently they didn't 

428.82 431.00 A: could not [noise] connect him with anything but 

432.40 435.95 A: i mean that's that was pretty close to home [laughter] 

435.09 436.47 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

435.98 439.85 A: and that was that was real soon after all that happened 

440.96 443.52 B: it's it's just unpredictable [laughter] 

443.06 444.85 A: very unpredictable 

445.41 458.21 B: and you know people have have been here and and worked here for for years and years and then all of a sudden [noise] there's some sort of connection somewhere along the line that that nobody thought about 

457.87 461.99 A: well and it's one of those things like they always say whenever they interview 

462.04 467.94 A: people who have lived near them or whatever well i would've never never suspected 

466.85 468.46 B: mhm 

468.98 471.54 A: and that's the way most of them were they we- they were 

471.90 474.95 A: assimilating right into their communities 

474.72 476.37 B: right 

477.01 480.51 A: [mn] it makes it scary to to go anywhere anymore 

480.76 488.62 B: yeah i mean it it's scary to go and scary to think that the things that you didn't give any thought to 

489.00 491.48 B: that that they're illegal weapons now 

491.36 492.32 A: (( [laughter] [noise] right )) 

492.15 499.48 B: i mean [laughter] i think i've lost about three pair of fingernail clippers [laughter] just for the fact of not thinking about it [laughter] 

498.38 499.92 A: [laughter] right 

500.01 503.05 A: because you're not in that mindset to think that way 

502.74 510.44 B: and and to stop and think that a pair of fingernail clippers as a deadly weapon is is not something you think about every day 

507.88 509.25 A: yeah 

510.45 511.57 A: no no it isn't 

512.67 517.61 A: i there's probably all kinds of things i carry with me on a daily basis that 

517.76 521.20 A: i wouldn't even give a second thought to of using 

521.45 522.16 A: in 

522.26 524.07 A: you know some violent way 

525.46 527.59 A: whereas you know if i go to the airport 

527.71 530.20 A: s- stop me and say well you can't have that 

530.12 531.65 B: mhm 

530.22 532.14 A: [laughter] you can't take that with you 

532.38 535.69 B: and and it's kind of unnerving too 

535.76 541.44 B: um i didn't realize it until i went through an airport down in miami a few years ago 

542.11 542.94 B: that 

543.03 546.21 B: did you realize that sugar 

546.44 550.53 B: will set off the detectors 

549.96 550.91 A: no 

551.20 553.04 B: and the reason i found out 

553.39 560.14 B: was really by accident we were on a layover and we were waiting at the airport and i went to get a cup of coffee 

560.66 561.69 B: and i put 

561.78 568.11 B: the powder cream and powder sugar for the other person that was with me in my shirt pocket because i had two cups of coffee to carry 

567.12 568.95 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

568.50 569.99 B: and i walked through 

570.18 575.97 B: and i set the alarm off i had already been through earlier and hadn't set the alarm off 

576.16 585.37 B: and the the person working the machine said i see you have two cups of coffee you don't happen to have a couple of packets of sugar in your pocket do you and i said yes i do he said take it out i 

585.51 596.46 B: took the two packets of sugar out laid them on the conveyor and they went through and i walked back through and it didn't set it off and he said it does it every time [laughter] he said 

595.33 597.27 A: [laughter] [noise] [noise] did he say why 

596.53 599.89 B: he says [mn] nobody knows but he said i saw you had two cups of
