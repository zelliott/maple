10.31 15.83 B: i would say for me it would probably be uh when the topic is 

16.58 17.89 B: someone who's been victimized 

19.17 21.39 A: oh that's true that's a good good one 

21.52 24.92 A: i i know that for myself i don't like 

25.32 29.29 A: a lot of foul language or or anything like that i mean i think you can be 

29.50 30.84 A: excellent comedian and not 

30.95 32.74 A: you know revert to 

32.76 34.41 B: well yeah like someone like bill cosby 

34.26 40.85 A: yeah oh he's excellent he's been an excellent example for our children and everything so i agree with that too but yes 

42.57 43.78 A: (( picking )) or to 

44.19 45.21 A: make fun 

45.49 46.13 A: someone who has 

46.79 47.76 A: been victimized is 

48.88 50.12 A: bad bad taste 

50.74 56.06 B: yeah yeah i do too and and i guess i i would agree with you as i tend to uh 

56.96 58.25 B: prefer somebody who is 

58.53 59.63 B: a little bit more clean 

59.67 61.21 A: right yeah 

60.41 61.13 B: then uh 

61.94 66.41 A: and and you know we've had a lot of good examples i mean like bonny hunt i think she is hilarious 

66.35 66.99 B: uh-huh 

66.95 68.12 A: and you know she 

67.67 69.09 B: and ray romano 

68.88 72.64 A: yes exactly just very very good and yet no 

70.43 70.86 B: yeah 

72.83 75.18 A: you know they don't have to revert to to 

75.36 77.33 A: terrible language or or 

77.46 78.91 A: eh it's kind of more like they kind of 

79.33 81.65 A: laugh at themselves you know 

81.31 84.45 B: right and i think with the language thing too 

85.49 86.59 B: sometimes 

92.79 94.33 B: (( -ple laugh )) than the actual topic 

94.38 94.94 A: right 

95.11 97.63 B: you know or the comedy themselves whereas um 

98.28 101.32 B: i mean like with bill cosby again since i mean since i was a little girl 

101.41 109.86 B: i can remember seeing him and he would be just hilarious just talking about you know his schoolmates or his teachers or you know his brother or just 

107.35 108.04 A: mhm 

108.61 110.36 A: or his children or his wife 

110.19 116.02 B: oh yeah or his kids or his wife or or um or anything like that but you could tell by 

114.28 114.87 A: mhm 

116.27 120.63 B: by what he was saying the topics he was saying that he had actually put quite a bit of thought into it 

120.35 121.73 A: right exactly 

120.90 126.03 B: you know it may have seemed easy in his delivery because he's done it a thousand times i'm sure but 

124.75 125.41 A: uh right 

126.14 128.15 B: it wasn't just falling back on 

128.25 131.43 B: you know bleep this and bleep just to kind of get the audience 

129.31 129.87 A: right 

129.96 130.97 A: exactly 

131.86 132.27 A: right 

132.33 133.63 B: going 

132.89 136.66 A: that's true i know um a while back um i saw uh h- 

136.99 147.50 A: the bunny bonny hunt show with jonathan winters and they were in together and they were improvising and it was so hilarious you know that they just fed off of each other's words you know 

147.14 149.04 B: it was that was it that sitcom she's on 

149.26 150.45 A: i think so yeah 

150.49 151.53 B: okay 

158.07 158.42 A: and 

158.62 164.25 A: and it was it was hilarious i mean they were so good and they never once used foul language 

159.08 159.50 B: wow 

164.12 164.55 B: mhm 

164.44 166.15 A: you know they talked about decent 

166.40 174.39 A: things you know and and a lot of it is about everyday life that is it can be quite funny you might as well laugh about it because it's not going to 

171.54 172.87 B: yeah that's true 

174.47 175.93 B: that's very true 

176.16 180.39 A: but i thought that was probably one of the best shows i have seen as far as um 

180.56 181.21 A: clean 

181.58 181.97 A: you know 

182.28 183.68 A: clean cut comedy 

183.27 183.79 B: mhm 

183.84 189.80 A: and and how they worked together and and feed off of each other you know and it was really really good 

190.66 191.15 B: right 

190.82 191.09 A: uh 

191.25 192.01 B: and um 

192.87 198.19 B: the everybody loves raymond show and i don't get that much of a chance to watch t._v. lately because i have a one year old and 

194.69 194.99 A: uh 

198.18 200.98 A: oh gosh yeah 

200.45 206.50 B: so i don't get too much of a chance to watch it but i know the the shows that i have watched sometimes the topics are 

207.36 208.37 B: somewhat serious t- 

208.56 209.03 B: (( )) 

209.79 210.44 B: but 

211.27 216.30 B: yet they're still able to present them in a funny way and also without 

216.07 216.68 A: right 

216.57 217.66 B: um (( )) 

217.03 217.62 A: offending 

217.76 221.14 B: exactly and w- it was not being ino- you know inoffensive 

218.50 219.20 A: mhm 

221.17 222.32 A: yeah i i agree 

221.67 222.35 B: offensive way 

222.64 225.34 A: and you know so many of the things are are 

225.82 226.31 A: um 

226.56 231.49 A: you could relate to because you know you've had them happen to you or or you know 

230.24 234.13 B: sure i mean everybody has a family most people have a spouse you know 

232.02 232.83 A: exactly 

233.07 235.15 A: exactly 

235.24 243.31 A: and uh and you know i think a lot of the comedians too if if they're the better ones can can help us i think even relate to 

243.78 250.66 A: sometimes we take things as as being such a crisis and you know it's laugh about it and go on you know 

249.53 251.10 B: right 

250.91 255.79 A: (( )) i think that's um a real important lesson you can learn from them too 

255.97 259.99 A: but i know as far as going and seeing any comedians i'm very careful who i go 

260.22 260.61 A: you know 

260.84 261.43 A: to see 

261.60 262.96 A: because i don't 

261.65 266.72 B: right well again i don't really get out that much lately so 

264.15 276.05 A: well i guess not my kids are grown so it's like i have a you know a little more free time and and but you know i love the set and and even at home being entertained it's so nice 

270.86 271.58 B: mhm 

276.19 278.12 A: be able to really laugh 

278.40 282.35 A: at something you know that that they have done or said or whatever 

282.03 282.46 B: mhm 

282.47 284.13 A: you can just kind of be down 

284.24 289.56 A: down at the mouth and yet -et a good comedian come on and it will just life your spirits 

290.58 291.50 A: wow you kn- 

291.59 295.70 A: i needed that didn't even realize it but i needed that 

292.44 293.68 B: yeah yeah 

294.45 295.07 B: that's true 

295.83 296.51 A: so 

296.69 299.07 A: and um i look back too to when 

299.19 299.98 A: uh i don't know 

300.23 306.85 A: you know you might be kind of too young but like uh carol brunette and tim conway oh my gosh they were 

304.43 305.47 B: oh yeah 

306.94 308.30 A: they were hilarious too 

308.53 308.98 A: and 

308.58 313.58 B: no i'm not too young i had my baby late in life yeah yeah i remember that 

310.51 312.51 A: oh okay 

313.81 314.97 A: that that was such a 

315.15 319.74 A: uh funny show and and something that you know you don't mind the the children watching with you 

319.51 326.08 B: right and that i mean anybody who watched carol brunette as a child i think will always kind of carry that soft spot for her 

325.57 327.21 A: oh yes definitely 

326.18 329.64 B: you know because she was so funny yet at the same time 

330.68 336.79 B: i don't know there was like a tenderness underlying tenderness in there too with you know some of those characters that she did 

334.07 334.76 A: i agree 

335.52 335.93 A: yeah 

337.31 338.65 A: very much so 

339.91 344.19 B: rather than um i don't know sometimes some of the comedy now seems almost like 

344.83 346.24 B: like an assault 

346.28 346.78 A: uh-huh 

346.71 347.54 B: you know 

346.95 347.60 A: that's true 

347.74 350.36 B: rather than like you said trying to 

350.99 354.79 B: show people the the humor in things and kind of lighten 

354.81 358.18 A: lighten up you know it's not brain surgery 

355.19 356.11 B: (( )) 

358.04 359.23 B: yeah 

358.41 369.42 A: i know i went to my niece and i went to the movies awhile back we just happened to go in and see this what is titled national security we had no clue what it was about 

369.38 370.29 B: mhm 

370.08 370.73 A: but it was 

371.07 371.77 A: we laughed s- 

371.96 380.71 A: so hard in that theatre that we were crying and we don't know if the other people were laughing at the the show or us because it was just absolutely hilarious 

380.32 381.47 B: and and what was the name of it 

381.55 382.72 A: national security 

383.67 387.71 A: and what was so funny was it you know i think what people could relate to was 

387.89 390.88 A: things like that can really happen things don't always 

391.01 392.51 A: appear what they seem 

392.26 392.81 B: yes 

392.81 401.05 A: and uh it was a you know a police officer and a per- a black person he had pulled over and he was white and you know it was so funny i mean 

406.56 406.90 B: mhm 

409.65 416.39 A: oh i say we were laughing so hard i can't even remember the the actor in it but it it was um 

417.35 421.56 A: oh i can't even remember his name darn it my kids always know who he is as soon as i say 

421.77 423.60 A: the black comedian 

423.50 424.52 B: c- chris rock 

425.68 426.23 A: what was his name 

426.41 427.18 B: chris rock 

428.29 429.58 A: is he that one that's got 

429.87 430.41 A: um 

430.93 432.04 A: i think it was him 

432.19 433.22 A: it might have been him 

434.21 438.05 A: oh what oh he's tall and slender and and he's been in um 

439.23 441.76 A: i can't even remember what shows he was in before 

440.91 443.13 B: there's chris rock and then there's that other guy 

444.12 447.12 B: who is in those that movie the movies with jackie chan 

447.64 451.12 A: oh yeah he (( eh he )) yeah i think it might have been that guy come to think of it 

448.05 448.38 B: but uh 

451.67 454.65 A: because i think he was playing in those movie with jackie chan 

455.16 459.48 A: oh i don't remember i just remember laughing so hard that it had been a long time 

457.99 460.90 B: okay i'll have to keep that one in mind if i if i ever go to rent movies 

460.95 462.74 A: yeah it it it was uh 

462.90 466.56 A: it was funny it it uh you know they had of course some 

467.19 472.27 A: some words that weren't the best but overall it was a really funny comedy i really 

472.23 478.92 B: yeah well and i think with comedy too there are there are some like bill cosby who can do it completely without 

478.91 479.51 A: oh yeah 

479.18 483.17 B: (( and profanity )) with movies i think it'd be hard to find a comedy (( )) it doesn't 

483.32 488.15 B: say anything but it's like is it every other word 

484.53 485.59 A: right exactly 

487.02 487.92 A: yes uh 

488.06 492.69 A: that's true too very true but it is uh to me reassuring to 

493.10 494.03 A: you know to see th- 

494.19 494.61 A: the 

494.77 497.46 A: even the newer comedians coming out who 

497.68 500.75 A: huh are kind of following in bill cosby's shoes instead of 

500.86 502.32 A: in some of those others that 

502.86 505.45 B: yeah maybe the pendulum is kind of swinging 

505.68 506.17 A: yeah 

514.53 515.56 A: oh he was
