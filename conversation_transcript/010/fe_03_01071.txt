106.62 107.95 A: [noise] um 

108.59 117.31 A: i can't think of any right now i know paul rodrigius years ago was was pretty good but then i think he kind of went over the line as well 

116.84 119.48 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i like um george lopez 

119.83 123.62 B: (( he's on um [noise] he has his own show on wednesday nights ))

134.56 135.36 B: yeah 

136.36 141.85 B: yeah yeah i think so the same thing with ah [noise] the my wife and kids is damon wayans' show

142.02 143.15 A: oh mhm 

144.65 150.38 B: they they're he's a comedian and an actor and he has his own show now and it it's a good family show too it's really funny 

150.21 151.91 A: right right 

151.24 153.22 B: that's like that's like um 

153.42 155.69 B: um bill cosby 

153.52 154.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

155.92 158.81 A: [cough] yeah bill cosby is excellent [noise] 

156.01 162.82 B: i think his his humor is great because he he has some adult humor in there but it doesn't cross the line 

163.21 168.67 A: right but it also sometimes goes over the kids' heads as well 

166.98 168.10 B: exactly 

168.13 171.63 B: that's like my wife or um [noise] whose line is it anyway 

171.55 173.01 A: yes uh-huh 

171.67 173.28 B: i think that does the same 

173.56 175.82 A: yes [noise] 

173.96 178.33 B: because my son will be laughing he has no idea what it is but he'll be laughing because we're laughing 

178.25 179.33 A: right 

178.81 179.89 B: yeah 

179.44 182.93 A: [noise] right or even sometimes they put comedy 

183.05 186.12 A: adult comedy into disney movies 

183.90 185.12 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

185.57 191.91 B: oh yeah like in ah toy story two [noise] that was the ah the latest one i've seen some of that 

188.33 190.63 A: yeah with a little bit 

191.08 198.97 A: yes uh-huh [noise] even in toy story where he where mr potato head took his lips off and stuck him on his behind 

198.35 208.48 B: yeah [laughter] or when he got scared and he lost everything from behind [laughter] [laughter] that was good yeah i um i think that's good now that they are putting them [noise] into disney movies because ah 

200.44 201.74 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

201.85 204.01 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

204.13 205.09 A: yeah 

208.72 212.81 B: it's um it's giving the adults some fun too when they're watching the movie 

212.69 223.16 A: right right but it's still in you know pretty good taste [noise] you know without without having to show the vulgarity of it all [noise] [noise] that's the part that i don't like 

215.62 217.25 B: yeah yeah 

219.97 222.57 B: yeah because i've gotten um 

222.74 237.43 B: i've gotten some emails sometime we send a lot of jokes um just for morale at work and um they're real strict about what you send but sometimes you get some stuff that that you just can't believe is actually some- i guess it's just someone else's taste on what they think is comedy 

226.49 227.54 A: right 

232.66 234.18 A: that's real trashy 

237.04 239.45 A: [noise] right right right 

238.06 240.56 B: i think where you draw the line is definitely 

240.88 242.03 B: opinion 

242.06 243.44 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

242.38 245.05 B: of each person but um 

245.68 248.45 B: yeah sometimes it goes way way over [laughter] 

248.15 256.95 A: right and then you have that option for that [noise] so called comedian email to just hit the delete button and go on [laughter] 

253.61 265.10 B: yeah and i think people people have at least people that i'm friends with have been really good about um kinda describing it ahead of time you know if you were offended by off taste humor 

262.02 263.70 A: right [noise] 

265.21 266.74 B: um don't open it 

265.22 268.13 A: (( [noise] don't read this yeah )) 

266.89 271.15 B: which that's another thing where i think the line should be drawn don't send it to someone 

268.67 269.40 A: [noise] 

271.60 276.24 B: even whether they're your friend or whether you know what type of humor they have don't send it to them 

276.58 278.97 B: um without any kind of a warning 

278.98 280.17 A: correct 

279.37 281.10 B: i don't think that's very nice 

280.62 282.00 A: [noise] [noise] that's true 

282.03 294.57 B: and even even some of the um cards now that are out um i love going to certain stores to get real fun fun cards and um they even have certain sections that are a little off humor or i mean off um 

289.72 290.51 A: uh-huh 

294.65 295.62 B: color 

295.18 296.31 A: off color 

295.62 310.48 B: um and i guess even i sent my mom to a store not too long ago and there was a brand of cards they're called apple cards and she wanted to get one that was a little off color for my uncle and they don't sell them there any more because and they weren't dirty dirty they were just a little off color and they said they had too many complaints 

310.39 311.64 A: [noise] oh wow 

311.04 314.97 B: and especially because the name was apple cards people probably just didn't even think so 

314.30 323.38 A: [noise] well they probably th- they may have associated it with apple c- corporation [noise] [noise] right right 

318.46 322.06 B: yeah yep or something for teachers you know you don't know 

322.66 327.53 B: but that's another thing whereas and the same with the ty- the type of humor i think that that 

327.80 332.72 B: when there's kids around that that shouldn't be like right in front of where they can be able to get at 

332.82 336.24 A: right [noise] exactly the the um 

336.82 340.42 A: wha- exploitation of body parts or 

339.61 341.20 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

341.03 345.61 A: exactly you know that [noise] that to me is not considered humor 

342.41 343.26 B: yeah 

345.23 348.90 B: no and especially when it's just in a regular card aisles 

346.49 347.69 A: [noise] 

349.05 354.66 B: you know and you go to pick it up yourself and you know my son's nine and i have him standing there with me looking at cards as well 

349.16 350.16 A: right 

354.70 368.26 B: and he picks up one and i'm like okay how am i going to explain that one to him [laughter] because of course at certain times i'm thinking certain things are funny but definitely would not want my son to see it and you know then he gets a hold of it and i have no idea how to explain it to him 

354.83 355.91 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

358.52 359.63 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

363.79 364.65 A: right 

368.33 371.76 A: right and then that puts us in a weird position 

371.11 374.52 B: uh-huh yep [laughter] 

372.65 374.26 A: [laughter] 

374.31 386.57 A: [noise] yeah you know you don't think about comedy being involved in so much you know so many different aspects of your life but it is even the radio the radio stations you know they're just 

381.75 383.47 B: yeah yeah 

383.68 384.60 B: oh yeah 

386.00 387.75 B: yeah see that's another one that's 

386.70 388.38 A: some of them are just 

388.42 389.91 A: out there on

430.79 434.33 B: and they were saying things in there i couldn't believe they were saying 

434.29 435.40 A: (( oh wow )) 

434.77 437.59 B: yeah and it just blew me away there so 

437.38 440.49 A: [noise] yeah and sometimes they have um 

440.53 446.67 A: contests that they think are just so wonderful you know who c- who can um

544.62 547.12 A: right you know [noise] that is
