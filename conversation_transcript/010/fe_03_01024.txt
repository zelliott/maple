8.75 11.32 A: this is the one topic that i don't like talking about but 

11.54 14.47 A: we could talk about we'll see how it goes 

14.02 17.71 B: right i i know it's not a very good thing to have to deal with but 

18.37 21.72 B: at this day and age we almost have to deal with a lot of different things we didn't want to before 

22.00 23.13 A: that is very true 

23.94 28.14 B: i you know i i'm not sure how people would react as far as uh this terrorist attack but 

28.75 33.50 B: i you know they they took us by surprise with the world trade center i don't think they are going to do that again 

34.70 35.31 A: well i guess 

35.50 38.76 A: the question was a little vague in asking if they thought people would panic 

38.89 40.36 A: i guess it depends on 

40.79 41.24 A: if 

41.50 43.92 A: if uh are they talking about people that 

44.01 44.96 A: are directly 

45.10 48.12 A: involved with it or the people that 

48.87 51.27 A: are just observers or just hear about it 

52.36 56.02 A: i think anybody involved in a terrorist attack is going to panic 

52.68 53.16 B: yeah i 

56.42 65.62 B: i would think so i mean without a doubt i mean it it's a very strange thing i've spent some time in okinawa when i was in the marine corps and it's a 

75.01 75.61 B: i mean that's 

75.80 77.72 B: that's really strange too y- i- but 

77.87 80.81 B: these people are going in and killing and we've never had that at our home front 

81.02 81.46 A: yeah 

82.29 85.92 B: and that's where the big deal comes in i think um how big it is 

86.85 88.33 B: a big part of this comes in 

88.38 88.82 A: yeah 

90.00 90.94 A: yeah i don't know i think 

91.65 93.71 A: it's hard to and it's hard to know like 

93.94 95.16 A: uh sometimes i wonder 

96.20 98.42 A: if i were involved in a situation like that 

99.14 100.14 A: how i would be 

100.62 101.59 A: and part of me thinks 

102.22 102.69 A: i would just 

102.90 106.45 A: totally freak out and you know be scared -cause 

107.08 114.74 A: i'm younger and i'm a women and it's natural i think for us to do but but then part of me thinks maybe i would be calm and not 

115.47 116.24 A: really 

116.46 117.21 A: i don't know 

117.76 121.47 A: it's tough to say how you would be until you are actually in that situation 

122.03 126.27 B: yes it is -cause i you know i always thought that you know what would i do if i was in 

126.51 132.37 B: uh seeing someone have an accident or something would i be there to help them and would i be able to do what i needed to do to take care of them 

132.49 133.02 A: right 

133.31 138.93 B: uh shortly after something did happen i was i'd be able to just help -em out a great deal 

139.16 139.69 A: yeah 

139.61 143.67 B: instead of taking the person to the hospital but that was very strange 

143.30 143.76 A: yeah 

144.96 149.34 B: so i mean this this terrorist attacks these these are (( )) acts of people who just aren't 

150.87 155.06 B: just don't care uh they don't care whether they live or die and i mean 

154.69 155.14 A: yeah 

156.92 157.65 B: that's scary 

156.93 157.52 A: i try 

157.88 160.59 A: i try not to watch the news too much 

160.75 162.61 A: and i try not not i don't read the paper 

163.51 166.70 A: and um well my husband is in the inactive reserves 

167.17 169.86 A: and he is actually due to get out 

170.27 172.74 A: and uh in like the next month or so but they froze 

173.34 174.08 A: all um 

174.81 175.46 B: discharges 

174.91 175.33 A: (( )) 

175.49 176.01 A: yeah 

176.17 179.26 A: so and we'll a little we'll a little worried 

177.57 179.37 B: so he's got an extended term in the service 

179.84 180.23 A: what 

180.49 182.60 B: he's going to extend his time in the service 

182.37 182.90 A: yeah 

183.26 186.28 A: but you mean he is in the inactive reserves but i mean we are still worried 

186.89 190.13 A: you know that if something happens he might have 

190.83 194.17 A: you know get called back in for active duty and 

191.81 192.12 B: well 

193.97 195.31 B: that is a very good possibility 

195.74 198.56 A: you know we worry i worry about that and and before 

199.55 202.97 A: i don't know i guess i didn't think well you know it is not going to happen to me 

203.91 208.19 A: you know and part of me thinks i'll be okay if he you know has to go but i don't 

208.33 211.14 A: when i think when if it came down to it and he had to 

211.79 212.35 A: you know 

212.69 215.31 A: leave and and be over there 

215.79 216.60 A: where all the 

216.97 221.54 A: guess you could say i i don't know i don't know how well i could keep it together 

221.92 223.32 A: and it's awful almost like a 

223.55 225.11 A: an attack in itself 

225.51 228.27 A: i mean it isn't direct but it's an indirect attack 

225.87 226.42 B: hm 

229.40 230.99 A: you know in my actual home 

231.14 233.26 A: you know in my home and i (( on )) me 

233.65 234.03 B: right 

234.32 235.26 A: i mean so 

235.36 237.19 A: i don't know how i would be if 

238.38 240.49 A: i'd say they are definitely for the most part 

241.06 242.32 A: people would panic 

243.08 248.71 B: yeah i think so too i think that of course it would and again it would depend on what they are using it and how they a- are introducing it with us 

249.41 250.15 B: by uh 

250.31 252.72 B: you know this anthrax was a scare that that 

252.63 253.21 A: right 

253.81 258.37 B: that is one thing and and they know he has got some of that over these he has got this mustard gas 

258.61 259.10 A: yeah 

259.73 263.03 B: uh you know he already used it on his own people he would think nothing about putting it 

263.14 263.76 B: on us 

263.88 264.33 A: yeah 

264.64 268.82 B: so i you know t- the threat is there and i think the same needs to come out 

269.47 271.22 A: well do you know what i heard today 

271.82 272.83 A: is that um 

273.09 276.01 A: they had uh an overwhelming um 

276.54 280.90 A: number of of purchases of u._p._s. uniforms on e. bay 

281.67 282.08 A: which is 

282.28 285.26 A: you know u._p._s. people deliver packages to businesses 

285.39 285.88 A: all 

285.54 285.84 B: hm 

286.21 288.03 A: all kinds of businesses even like 

288.12 289.64 A: you know like government 

289.82 291.46 A: you know businesses and 

290.61 291.02 B: right 

291.35 294.39 B: and they are not screened well they are screened but not like 

294.58 295.51 B: some of the other places 

295.82 296.38 A: so now 

296.62 301.57 A: you know uh the big scare is okay is the u._p._s. person going to come and drop off a bomb in our business 

302.57 303.42 B: right or 

303.59 304.64 B: anthrax or 

304.92 306.14 A: or whatever and that's 

306.03 308.54 B: that wouldn't have to have to be a bomb it could be just a 

306.24 306.89 A: just like 

309.55 310.55 A: it could be yeah 

310.95 313.67 A: for an (( )) no there is another kind of scare and it's 

314.16 314.84 A: ugh 

315.49 317.35 A: it's just like one thing after another and then 

317.79 326.04 A: you know they had this thing where everybody was going out and buying plastic and taping up their windows and buying extra supplies of this and that and 

326.93 331.90 B: they are going to do just that they are going to panic if if they just keep their heads about it i think this would be 

327.05 327.94 A: i mean it's 

332.41 334.37 B: taken care of within a short period of time 

335.71 339.20 B: unlike some of the other conflicts we have been engaged in i don't think 

339.77 341.61 B: they are going to give this one much more than the 

343.31 348.80 B: you know it's going to get a lot of attention so it's not going to be handled like some of the other things 

348.47 348.87 A: yeah 

349.91 351.51 A: my my gut reaction 

350.07 351.72 B: yeah it sounds it's going to be a lot quicker 

352.11 352.65 B: i'm sorry 

352.68 353.72 A: my gut reaction uh 

353.83 357.59 A: i i don't uh really i'm not really for um violence and 

358.70 360.22 A: i don't really think that that is necess- 

360.33 363.54 A: -arily the answer but i know a lot of people would disagree with me 

364.65 365.09 A: but 

365.73 366.37 A: i don't know 

367.13 370.93 B: well we've actually he he supposed to have been disarmed in nineteen ninety 

371.96 372.60 B: this is 

373.29 374.68 B: twelve years ago and he is still 

374.85 379.59 B: messing around with us he is still hasn't d- done what he said he was going to ten twelve ten twelve years ago 

379.79 380.30 A: right 

380.84 387.25 B: well so you got to do something with him and like i said he is definitely a threat because he is not opposed at all 

382.90 383.32 A: yeah 

387.56 388.09 B: about 

388.47 391.40 B: using it on his own people why would he care if he kills us 

392.82 394.58 A: yeah uh what i don't understand is 

393.44 393.74 B: (( )) 

395.10 396.83 A: and i know this is a bad thing to say but 

397.33 398.46 A: why doesn't somebody just 

399.06 399.78 A: can't somebody just 

400.04 400.62 A: kill 

400.78 405.80 A: these people you know i mean you figure there's people that assassinate our president 

406.98 409.94 A: wouldn't you think there would be somebody that would want to assassinate them 

410.98 412.23 B: well i'm sure (( )) 

412.48 413.04 B: are you there 

413.23 414.06 A: yup i'm still here 

413.86 420.33 B: okay i i thought i lost you there i there probably is but then he becomes a mortar 

421.03 425.17 B: they need to do him like they did the germans after world war two (( )) 

425.91 431.01 B: uh the trials the nurenberg trials and bring these people justice on war crimes that they were doing 

431.18 431.71 A: mhm 

432.21 435.50 B: because he is very been very inhumane to all of his people 

435.65 436.11 A: yeah 

436.62 439.12 B: and this man and he 

439.74 440.88 B: he just doesn't care 

441.29 441.74 A: right 

443.10 446.49 B: that's a scary thought and and he's got to be helping 

447.50 452.09 B: uh the uh al qaeda so they have been training in his country which i couldn't believe is true because 

452.33 456.94 B: you know he don't need this money as much but i'm sure he is getting his share of it 

456.55 457.09 A: mhm 

460.01 461.82 B: all of the country is poor but he is not 

462.16 462.67 A: yeah 

464.00 465.90 A: i don't know i guess i look at it as an 

466.05 467.54 A: you know i try not to 

469.23 476.00 A: can you know to be overly sensitized to everything that is going on i'm trying to be aware more than i was before 

476.50 476.97 B: mhm 

476.98 481.43 A: but and i just i guess i kind of figure if something happens if i'm in a plane and it gets 

482.37 488.21 A: you know flown in to something or if i'm in a building and it blows up it and i die you know i try to 

488.90 490.93 A: just remember that i lived a good life and 

491.65 492.92 A: try not to be afraid of it 

494.18 494.83 A: you know 

494.28 496.27 B: well you can't we can't live our life in fear 

496.48 496.79 B: that's 

496.97 497.87 B: that's no way to live 

498.16 498.62 A: right 

498.92 508.47 B: and that's what they are trying to do they are trying to induce terror as well and that's their whole idea -cause they are like well you don't know when the next one is going to hit or when it is going to hit it could be any place at any time 

508.69 509.14 A: right 

508.85 509.11 B: true 

509.76 514.23 B: -cause if you sitting around and dwell on that you are going to drive yourself crazy trying to figure out what they are going to do
