50.71 51.55 A: try 

51.60 55.72 A: try to cease it as much as you can and try to um

67.48 78.36 A: it's just right and then like i said lives are going to be lost and families are going to have to grieve which everybody's grieving now because of the terrorism

93.50 97.39 A: that have weapons and that could destroy the united states or 

98.31 100.96 A: all the countries that i mean 

101.61 105.28 A: they should try to stop everything not just one one place 

105.61 107.97 A: you know it just seems like he first he's 

108.26 111.64 A: (( on to bin laden about the terrorism now he's on )) 

111.89 115.25 A: saddam hussain about it [noise] and i mean 

113.92 114.89 B: well i 

115.38 120.16 B: i was going to say that i kind of i kind of agree with president bush though that the the u._n. 

115.82 116.58 A: (( [noise] )) 

119.34 120.49 A: for war 

120.68 121.49 B: pardon 

121.68 123.25 A: you go ahead i'm sorry 

122.68 131.81 B: okay i i agree with president bush as as far as that the u._n. gave him an ultimatum to you know disarm himself and he has ignored it 

131.92 133.02 B: and i i 

132.24 133.59 A: who the u._n. 

133.54 136.57 B: the no yes saddam saddam 

134.16 136.27 A: what he didn't ask 

136.84 138.82 B: has has ignored the u._n. 

137.24 138.18 A: (( go ahead )) 

140.17 143.16 B: saddam hussain has has ignored the u._n. 

143.20 146.82 B: resolution to to disarm these things to get rid of them 

146.50 148.15 A: well not totally 

148.75 155.79 A: he has disarmed some ways but not [noise] well he hasn't done i guess i but what the thing is 

155.99 164.33 A: okay we have weapons of mass destruction in the united states [noise] so what is the big deal with the u._n. having weapons of mass destruction 

159.37 161.18 B: right right 

164.74 168.90 A: (( i mean the united states wants to be the only one with mass destruction )) 

169.44 174.95 B: well when the original agreement was made it was between united states and russia 

175.17 182.80 B: and they agreed to you know do away with certain types of weapons united states destroyed theirs but russia never destroyed theirs 

183.41 187.35 B: so now that leaves the united states in an untrusting form 

187.50 188.35 A: yeah 

187.58 191.74 B: and that's exactly what's happening with iraq with this situation 

191.75 193.71 B: is that he says he is 

193.81 207.08 B: but we know from satellite observation that the stuff exists we know from talking with his own people the stuff exists which means he is not following the rules that were set up by the united nations 

198.80 199.69 A: yeah 

207.68 214.02 B: and i think that it's unfortunate that the rest of the world doesn't realize that what president bush is trying to do is to get this guy 

214.10 214.96 B: to 

215.39 219.54 B: what can i say conform to to the rules that everyone else is living by 

219.31 219.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

219.89 222.48 A: okay but if we go to war then what 

223.10 224.78 B: well it's unfortunate 

223.79 226.24 A: (( i mean what i- i- i mean )) 

227.55 228.41 A: (( if )) 

228.48 233.83 A: is okay well we go to war is is all the weapons going to be destroyed [noise] 

234.49 242.57 A: the weapons of mass destruction or are they still going to be there we just going to war because he's not given them up 

241.89 246.47 B: it's basically because he is defying and not giving them up that's right 

247.68 250.24 A: but i'm saying when we go to war 

250.91 253.86 A: if that's not going to make him give them up 

253.94 255.92 A: because we go to war 

256.25 257.53 A: [noise] if he's not 

256.25 257.09 B: no 

257.28 260.00 B: what it's going to do is probably destroy him 

261.80 267.23 B: see i see i agree that iraq has has been mismanaged for many many years 

264.42 265.19 A: [noise] 

268.79 274.21 B: and i i think that getting rid of him would straighten out a lot of problems in that area of the of the world 

268.93 269.83 A: uh-huh 

275.01 278.45 B: because he is being so defiant you know just kinda like a 

278.68 282.07 B: ah he he's setting an example which is a bad example 

281.75 292.55 A: [noise] but what about the ones that's not against er that's not with him we i mean everybody's against war mo- well most of the people are against war [noise] 

292.88 296.51 B: see i can i can agree i'm against war but 

293.04 294.01 A: and i'm 

296.93 305.22 B: somebody's got to get in there and straighten him out because he won't listen he won't do what his what what the world is telling him 

305.94 307.28 A: [noise] but it's 

307.12 311.64 B: on one hand he agrees to do it and then he turns around and doesn't 

312.03 317.31 A: [noise] and then and when he does it if and like he's accumulated more 

318.61 320.24 B: he's accumulating more 

319.95 322.44 A: [noise] more weapons of mass destruction 

323.05 326.91 B: yes that's that's what they feel he is doing is is he is making more 

325.97 326.97 A: [noise] 

327.01 328.91 A: that's what i'm saying so 

329.87 332.39 B: well see that's why they have to get him outta there 

330.54 331.33 A: w- 

332.75 336.78 B: you get him outa there and and the weapons will probably disappear 

333.66 334.62 A: yeah 

337.51 342.21 B: it's it's his ill leadership that is really causing the problem 

343.40 348.53 A: okay but we we get rid of him and then what about the other people that's got weapons of mass destruction 

348.90 357.95 B: well ah everyone else a- as far as i know is is abiding by what the the united nations has set up for the the guidelines for these particular weapons 

351.24 352.21 A: [noise]

379.56 381.67 B: but they don't have a bomb yet 

381.95 384.73 B: so they haven't really broken any of the rules 

385.04 387.75 B: or the guidelines that were set up 

385.47 386.12 A: [noise] 

388.70 389.44 A: (( mm ))

393.32 394.35 A: (( yes )) 

395.03 396.18 A: [noise]

402.56 408.98 B: take over the south vietn- -nam as well er korea south korea north korea and make it all one 

404.44 405.21 A: [noise] 

410.67 411.90 A: mhm 

411.06 413.77 B: but the south doesn't want to be part of the north 

414.92 420.28 B: you know it's again again one one civilization is pressing it's will on another 

415.26 416.59 A: [noise]

445.31 446.60 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

445.90 451.97 B: they they seem to kill each other off pretty easily they they don't have a a whole lot of concern about life 

452.74 453.74 A: yeah 

453.44 456.40 B: that that i mean that's something that i don't really understand i mean 

456.35 470.61 B: i'm an older person i value my life quite a bit i value i value the people around me their lives quite a bit but to to think that you know well just because i don't like what this person stands for i should put a bomb on my body and go blow him up as well as myself 

459.37 460.36 A: yeah 

469.81 471.06 A: [noise]

476.67 477.68 A: [noise] 

477.10 481.78 B: perfectly all right to go put a bomb on a bus and blow it up and and kill forty fifty people 

483.30 485.53 B: i i don't think that's the way things should be done 

485.49 486.58 A: no 

487.10 488.77 A: (( no should never take a life )) 

487.66 488.56 B: and 

488.73 491.11 B: getting rid of saddam hussain 

490.89 499.01 A: and the people that live over there they do have to live with fear 'cause they don't know where he gone [noise] just storing him or stop him giving him food 

495.92 497.19 B: (( oh right ))

509.98 512.01 B: [laughter] no no no i'm here 

512.16 516.62 B: yeah bin laden is is a lot of the money behind these different er 

516.63 521.56 B: things that go on over there and that's why they want to get him because then they can stop the money flow 

521.24 523.01 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

521.81 526.11 B: it will make it harder for a lot of these terrorist people to do what they've been doing 

526.45 527.56 A: yeah 

528.52 534.38 B: i mean it it only make sense that if you cut off the money flow things are going to going to come to a halt for at least for a while 

532.28 533.75 A: [noise] 

535.36 536.51 B: but i mean you know 

536.58 542.17 B: he admittedly is behind a lot of the the terrorist acts that have happened in the past ten fifteen years 

542.58 545.82 B: well that makes him just like a what the nazi's were 

544.67 552.02 A: okay we look what what i'm trying what what i'm try what i'm saying is is how did it go from 

552.11 555.14 A: saddam not saddam but bin laden to 

555.52 556.63 A: to him 

556.71 558.37 B: (( to from laden to )) 

557.54 558.47 A: how was 

558.94 565.97 A: (( i mean 'cause they don't work for the same org- terrorist organization [noise] )) 

563.63 568.86 B: well they they claim they don't but but there is there's gotta be some connection between them 

568.71 569.94 A: (( well you think )) 

569.49 571.14 B: i think so yes 

571.08 572.34 A: [noise] oh okay 

571.49 577.09 B: because they're both defying things i mean one guy's been hiding out for how long eighteen twenty-four months 

577.16 578.22 A: (( yeah )) 

577.41 583.12 B: he won't come out in the public because he knows he's done wrong and then of course you take er hussain 

583.39 590.31 B: they they say right out he's got a half a dozen doubles he doesn't come out in the public either why because he knows he's wrong 

590.70 591.62 A: yeah 

590.75 593.12 B: he knows he shouldn't be doing what he's doing 

593.35 597.22 A: yeah but he got his whole country covering up hiding him out 

596.62 599.41 B: well he's got them he's got them so scared
