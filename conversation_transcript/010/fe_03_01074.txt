1.05 4.18 A: hi this is cindy how are you doing 

3.56 5.73 B: h- good my name is karen 

5.86 8.35 A: okay have you done this before 

7.78 8.68 B: no [laughter] 

8.64 11.50 A: okay me neither [laughter] 

10.65 14.08 B: i guess we're supposed to talk about hu- the humor [mn] 

14.02 15.88 A: yeah um 

16.18 19.26 A: what do you think is draws the line i 

17.67 18.70 B: (( ah )) 

20.20 24.81 B: one is vulgar and you know using bad words ah 

25.69 28.54 B: i don't know i don't appreciate that and ah 

30.67 33.49 A: think it also depends where it is 

32.88 37.71 B: yeah that i guess that also depends also i mean sometimes you could be watching 

37.80 41.42 B: a kids' show and they might use something but it's 

41.54 44.05 B: you know it has a different meaning [laughter] 

43.84 44.88 A: mhm 

45.16 46.77 A: yeah i um 

46.63 50.44 A: i think the cartoons sometimes even go too far 

50.23 62.45 A: but [laughter] some of them say you fool and i have a child and he repeats that [laughter] so yeah i think um i think in the work place too a lot of times people think its okay to 

62.42 72.17 A: to use bad words like you're saying and maybe at a party it would be acceptable but at work it's unacceptable 

65.31 66.22 B: (( oh yeah )) 

68.18 69.43 B: right at a 

71.47 76.63 B: yeah and a lot of people think like work you know work is like anywhere 

76.45 78.18 A: yeah [laughter] 

76.81 80.82 B: you know because they're there most of the time so they think it's acceptable 

80.92 95.10 A: even outside it even outside work if you're still like some people like to hang out in the barn or the back i don't know how your work is but they think it's okay because they're outside but we're still at work we're just on a break [laughter] so 

94.39 101.99 B: yeah that's i mean that's a big thing i mean sometimes you know the people you know the state i'm in there's no smoking in the buildings 

102.04 109.97 B: so you go outside and um you could be leaving the building just to go home and people are there smoking 

110.13 115.15 B: and when they're smoking you know sometimes just hanging outside they say like the worst things 

114.91 121.76 A: yeah [laughter] yeah i think that happens everywhere i'm in new mexico and even out here they're like that 

115.53 116.41 B: [laughter] 

120.42 122.01 B: oh okay i'm in new york oh 

122.13 124.75 A: yeah i used to live in long island so 

124.66 125.77 B: (( that's where i am )) 

125.76 127.07 A: oh really 

126.36 127.60 B: yeah 

127.11 129.59 A: oh you sound just like my old friend 

129.54 140.56 A: but we're not supposed to talk about that [laughter] [laughter] no i think um like we have a comedy club out here laughs and of course they're gonna cuss and say bad words but you're expecting that 

140.06 141.26 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

140.51 143.06 A: so then then i think it's okay 

142.85 145.87 A: i feel that if they think if it hurt someone's feelings 

145.64 155.94 A: or if it's against like i saw a comedy show the other night on t._v. and it was against handicaps and i was very very against it people were laughing and it was very offensive to me 

150.36 151.37 B: right 

155.71 162.08 A: even if though they said it was their brother i still think it's offensive because it can happen to anybody 

161.71 164.66 B: that yeah that's one hundred percent i mean 

165.09 167.99 B: on t._v. you know you might just see 

168.40 174.51 B: even on the ah you know sometimes the news they'll say the wrong you know something about someone 

175.13 178.92 B: and they don't realize that it could offend that person 

175.40 176.38 A: mhm 

178.87 180.73 A: yeah i i ag- 

179.69 182.97 B: and you know like sometimes they just don't care about it 

183.16 192.11 A: yeah i think they don't real- they think sometimes people don't have feelings because they're a superstar but they do too i would think they would 

190.82 194.38 B: everyone has feelings no matter where things are said 

194.59 198.94 A: yeah i think something that would hurt someone's feelings maybe someone in the audience 

198.79 210.66 A: has a you know a child with a mental disability and or or a family member and they're making fun of it and i don't think that's funny i think they could think of something better than that [laughter] the comedians 

209.27 211.56 B: well also in the classroom 

211.58 213.56 B: you know sometimes 

213.98 219.72 B: a kid you know might hear something and they repeat it and they think it's funny 

214.44 215.25 A: oh y- 

219.69 220.70 A: yeah 

220.00 223.19 B: and then the kids are coming home with that type of humor 

223.18 231.53 A: yeah i agree i think that's wrong too i think most people agree on that that you know that it you have to draw somewhere 

231.26 236.11 B: yeah because kids are learning it from t._v. from even you know like some g. rated 

231.96 232.50 A: (( wh- )) 

236.42 241.17 B: g. rated movies i mean they have you know some bad humor 

241.40 243.54 A: yeah i agree 

243.56 248.01 A: that's definitely true because then they repeat it like you said um 

248.42 259.99 A: i can't think of anything else except for if it hurts someone's feelings or if it's if it's offensive that might hurt someone's feelings too if they're offensive words they don't want to hear that sometimes 

259.79 260.98 B: yeah um 

261.28 262.48 B: you know i mean 

262.55 266.06 B: people say offensive things about the president and you know no one 

266.53 267.58 A: yeah 

266.60 267.71 B: i mean there's 

267.75 271.97 B: i mean what i'm say- you know that's the same thing he has feelings but 

272.46 278.52 B: you know i guess when it's right behind your back and you overhear it things like that that's all like hurting feelings 

278.43 283.79 A: [laughter] oh yeah behind your back because a lot of times they're right you can it'll get to you 

283.45 284.41 B: right 

284.72 290.79 A: yeah so yeah i like to watch comedy shows but [laughter] sometimes they go too far 

290.61 292.34 B: yeah some of them do [laughter] 

292.32 294.34 A: yeah and some of them don't 

294.40 306.56 A: some of them um i think a lot of you know the humor is good you know and they're making fun of their own family [laughter] [laughter] it is usually funny because they make fun of themselves or 

305.97 312.31 B: right like um i know like here like everyone loves raymond they make fun of each other you know they're all family 

310.73 312.00 A: yeah 

312.27 318.56 A: yeah exactly that's sounds exactly like bill cosby he makes fun of his family [laughter] 

317.50 321.71 B: right but you know they don't go outside of that and their family learns that you know 

321.83 324.01 B: they say it right to them not 

325.20 327.78 A: yeah they know it's gonna be on [laughter] they 

327.01 327.92 B: right 

327.92 336.60 A: they probably if they they probably tell them first or you know they they think it's okay usually i would think if you're making fun of your own family 

336.67 339.75 A: [mn] in the comedy but um 

340.00 342.53 A: behind their backs then that's different 

342.61 349.66 B: you know what else i find um on the computer sometimes you get email of jokes and 

350.47 351.33 B: um 

350.69 352.13 A: yeah 

351.42 365.87 B: you know like you might belong to a group or something and people that don't realize that you know one person might like it and one doesn't you know like i get some that are like really to me they're offensive but to someone else they might like it 

360.19 361.53 A: yeah i get 

365.87 377.71 A: yeah i get a lot of jokes like from people that say that say about like democrats or republicans and they don't know who they're sending it to if they agree with that or not [mn] 

377.36 379.64 B: right you never know where it ends up 

379.47 381.64 A: yeah exactly [mn] 

381.69 384.03 A: that's all i can really think of 

383.49 387.01 B: i know i'm just trying that's what i keep coming up with a little something 

386.85 389.10 A: yeah um i 

389.63 393.92 A: can't really think of any- um you know making fun of 

394.36 395.28 A: um 

395.75 401.33 A: i don't know what else they make fun of on the cosby shows animals that's okay usually 

396.77 398.23 B: i guess you know it's 

400.96 408.88 B: yeah that's not bad i mean i guess if it's n- you know that's acceptable i think i what was the topic what humor is acceptable and what's offensive 

408.82 421.02 A: yeah and what you find offensive i seem to think the like you said offensive words or making fun of someone behind their back or or handicapped or things like that or 

421.76 422.65 B: right 

421.83 427.08 A: i can't think of anything else that pretty much covers it ah 

425.21 426.89 B: (( yeah )) 

427.50 428.53 B: okay 

428.16 431.29 A: i can't think of anything else that would offend someone 

430.90 432.63 B: (( neither can i [noise] )) 

432.74 444.59 A: i think that i know they do a lot of fat jokes and i'm not exactly thin and [laughter] those jokes seem to be okay usually because they're usually making fun of themselves or 

444.85 450.60 A: not a particular person they're usually making fun of you know a group of people 

450.10 451.49 B: right 

451.09 453.41 A: so it's usually kind of funny 

453.32 454.40 B: yeah most 

453.42 456.12 A: so that doesn't seem to be that offensive 

455.46 460.70 B: yeah because i'm the same i you know i'm not totally thin so i understand that one and i 

460.07 467.99 A: [laughter] yeah i i can't think of anything else i usually they make fun of themselves it's usually the best because 

468.43 474.62 A: because most people you know they know what what's funny about themselves [laughter] 

468.44 469.45 B: (( yeah they )) 

473.86 475.08 B: yeah 

475.34 476.24 A: so that's 

476.27 478.95 B: i don't know what else i can't think of anything else 

476.64 478.78 A: (( i can't think of anything else )) 

479.03 480.24 A: um 

480.83 493.14 A: or they make fun of you know like um i remember seeing one they made fun of um when the when first the cordless phones came out [laughter] and they were making fun of that that was really funny 

492.85 505.79 B: yeah those are cu- you know like those are sometimes stupid but they're cute yeah that's and you know like some of the stupid jokes are acceptable because they're so stupid that you have to laugh even though they're not offensive to anyone 

497.38 498.55 A: yeah 

503.27 504.95 A: [laughter] 

505.67 509.02 A: yeah yeah i like those ones or 

509.03 510.12 A: um 

510.18 512.62 A: can't think what else they make fun of um 

513.96 515.32 B: restaurants 

514.10 518.94 A: they make fun of drunks that's okay [laughter] to me 

517.71 526.19 B: and also when they make fun of like restaurants but they don't do it in like a bad way they'll say like a joke about like you know mcdonalds or something like that 

525.47 533.32 A: yeah and everyone agrees i'm sure even the mcdonalds agree [laughter] and that's pretty funny 

530.53 531.53 B: right 

532.13 537.15 B: like you know i know out here they call like white castles belly bombers and you know [laughter] 

536.39 538.62 A: [laughter] 

539.00 546.84 A: yeah they don't have white castles out here just they only get it frozen [laughter] from the store [laughter] 

545.61 550.97 B: well sometimes i think this the place has that too and they just heat them up [laughter] 

550.39 551.60 A: yeah 

551.82 555.48 B: but yeah but i mean no they're the only things i could really think of 

555.65 562.32 A: well this is better than the other topic they gave me last night so i i didn't accept that on terror [laughter] 

561.30 563.26 B: me too [laughter] [laughter] 

562.50 573.25 A: [laughter] though making fun of bin laden is definitely okay with me [laughter] i think most americans would agree with that one [laughter] 

572.26 577.08 B: right yes s- i mean you know actually you know what some of the 

577.64 589.98 B: jokes that i get you know that i hear about like iraq and different things sometimes they're okay but they're some that you know are offensive like you know the service people don't like them 

590.03 591.09 A: yeah 

590.14 596.94 B: you know because those could be on a borderline they could be offensive depending how they're told and written 

596.80 599.89 A: that's true too it depends on what how they
