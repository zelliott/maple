6.85 11.46 A: so what do you think you would do you think you would remain calm or do you think uh 

11.60 12.72 A: you would panic 

13.08 17.40 B: uh i think i would remain calm -cause there's probably not a whole lot that you could do 

17.87 18.75 A: uh yeah 

18.08 20.16 B: to have an influence on it 

20.50 21.04 A: uh-huh 

22.25 26.48 A: at at uh can i ask where you you live i'm thinking i live in the d._c. area 

26.46 29.13 B: i live um near atlanta 

29.17 29.74 A: okay 

29.90 31.75 A: yeah -cause i know we are getting um 

32.66 33.33 A: um 

33.94 39.95 A: you know that i think we were voted i heard on the radio today the most dangerous city because of terrorism and that type of thing 

39.80 40.36 B: mhm 

40.16 45.66 A: um with the government and stuff like but it seems like like life here pretty much you know goes on day to day 

46.14 46.82 B: well 

46.51 46.94 A: so 

47.34 48.49 B: i guess the same here 

49.77 51.71 A: i know i happen to be a teacher 

52.28 63.19 A: and like with the schools here and everything now i mean we are going through um like debriefings and trainings as far as if there was uh like a chemical or biological um 

63.75 71.60 A: or chemical released in to the air and the schools have um like all their procedures and things put in place so that's sort of amazing you know that 

71.93 73.45 A: that the world has come to that 

73.67 74.22 B: mhm 

74.80 75.25 A: um 

76.29 79.28 B: so how long have you been participating with the study 

79.61 80.51 A: with this study 

80.70 82.90 A: this i just signed up today 

80.71 81.17 B: uh-huh 

83.39 85.20 B: okay so did i 

84.62 89.54 A: okay yeah i just i just heard about it so i just signed up today but 

89.80 94.54 B: i guess i don't have a whole lot to say about the (( )) effects of 

94.63 97.82 A: yeah i mean i don't know -cause i know that when um 

97.99 100.09 A: you know and nine eleven 

100.23 100.87 A: um 

101.93 109.46 A: that effected you know a lot of people in our area and i think it was more shock but i would say you know i would 

105.78 106.23 B: uh-huh 

109.89 111.67 A: i was pretty calm but i mean i think 

112.47 118.41 A: i don't know i think also though i knew i'm i'm in the suburbs of d._c. so 

118.85 121.56 A: y- you know i i was calm but i knew i was safe 

121.89 122.44 B: mhm 

122.45 125.77 A: um but my mother in law actually happened to be at the pentagon that day 

126.08 126.94 B: oh really 

126.75 134.91 A: yeah and i was teaching so i couldn't watch the news you know i was getting like little glimpses of information and things like that and um 

135.08 136.79 A: i couldn't get in touch with her 

137.13 139.14 A: and so um and 

139.49 142.05 A: um you know and so i really felt like we were getting 

156.62 157.15 A: it's 

157.68 158.42 A: u- um 

159.59 160.83 A: you know and i i think 

161.15 162.40 A: generally we remained 

162.51 163.73 A: i remained calm so 

164.08 164.57 B: mhm 

164.72 165.58 A: i don't know we'll see 

166.01 170.07 B: so do you think we will actually have a war like here 

170.51 173.86 B: in america or is it all going to be overseas like in the gulf war 

173.98 178.11 A: i don't know you know i'm surprised that there hasn't been another terrorist attack already 

178.42 178.93 B: really 

178.97 182.95 A: you know i thought after nine eleven there would be another one in a few months 

182.99 183.92 B: uh-huh 

183.81 184.55 A: so 

185.32 194.38 A: and i know when when after nine eleven like i just i had always have to like turn on the t._v. before i went to bed and when i woke up you know to make sure the world was okay 

194.22 197.47 B: i still do that too so i guess you are normal 

195.45 197.18 A: do you 

197.47 198.13 A: yeah 

198.79 201.19 A: um but i i don't do that as much now 

201.43 201.96 B: uh-huh 

201.88 208.47 A: you know and so i don't know if our guards you know are going down so i'm shocked that it's really gone on this long and 

208.81 209.43 A: um 

210.15 213.83 A: that that there hasn't been another terrorist attack in the united states 

213.94 216.32 B: r- i feel like we are being terrorized more by 

216.42 216.87 B: our 

217.06 218.61 B: own government and the media 

218.81 220.76 B: than than actual 

221.25 223.87 B: terrorists from iraq or anywhere 

223.39 224.15 A: really 

224.18 229.02 B: i really do i i sometimes wonder if they are 

229.13 230.10 B: making more 

230.21 232.47 B: of a threat than what there actually is 

232.79 235.32 B: just so they won't lose the support of 

235.59 237.11 B: the american public 

237.28 237.90 A: right 

237.94 241.09 B: so i wonder if there actually is a real serious 

241.26 241.89 B: threat 

241.87 242.40 A: mhm 

242.95 244.73 B: i uh i personally don't 

245.60 246.59 A: you don't feel like there is 

247.38 254.36 B: no not not to the extent i mean i- if anything happened it would probably be something small and like an individual 

254.50 255.58 B: thing i don't 

254.62 255.16 A: mhm 

255.69 262.33 B: i don't foresee a whole military coming and taking over our country or anything so i just feel like the media is really 

262.64 266.05 B: and and our own government is making more of it than actually 

266.16 266.75 B: there is 

266.72 267.29 A: yeah 

267.43 268.87 B: because they have other (( )) 

269.28 277.77 A: yeah i don't think like i don't i wouldn't envision like a military or something like that coming i'm surprised that there haven't been like suicide bombers 

277.94 278.77 B: mhm 

278.02 280.01 A: or things like that like in israel 

280.34 280.83 B: yeah 

280.72 282.74 A: you know because that's just it's 

283.21 288.59 A: it's so hard to protect it you can't protect against everything and everyone you know what i mean i mean that's 

289.43 291.09 A: part of the freedom of our country 

291.43 291.96 B: yeah 

292.04 297.59 A: so i'm just surprised that you know there hasn't been like individuals suicide bombers and that type of thing 

297.81 298.39 B: mhm 

298.59 299.05 A: but 

300.13 303.63 A: but i mean if you would have asked me you know before nine eleven i never would have thought 

303.94 305.58 A: anything like that would have happened either 

306.13 306.74 B: yeah 

306.96 307.51 A: so 

308.04 308.96 B: well i don't know 

309.10 309.77 B: w- i 

310.10 313.15 B: i guess all you can do is just pray and trust that god will 

313.91 314.75 B: take care of you 

314.82 317.62 A: yeah yeah you know i think it puts a whole new 

318.26 319.90 A: appreciation on life 

320.07 320.64 B: uh-huh 

320.84 321.58 A: you know where 

322.88 329.64 A: (( um )) you know before i felt like i was maybe a little young and naive and it sort of i never thought something like this would happen in my lifetime 

330.03 330.52 B: mhm 

330.63 331.06 A: so 

332.18 332.68 B: hm 

333.10 337.42 A: so we really have to talk about terrorism this whole time huh 

336.70 339.77 A: yeah i know i'm thinking how many minutes have we been talking 

339.75 341.32 B: probably about two 

343.00 347.97 A: i don't know if they let us know on the phone or if like if it beeps or i didn't 

348.07 349.81 A: i didn't check exactly 

348.15 353.74 B: i think they do and and somehow they got my cell phone number instead of calling my home number 

353.11 354.30 A: oh 

354.46 356.23 B: so i'm curious about that but 

356.38 357.17 A: huh 

357.28 357.81 B: anyway 

358.09 360.69 A: yeah i think we've probably been on the phone about five minutes or so 

361.06 361.74 B: yeah 

361.74 363.19 A: but uh 

362.51 367.69 B: i i just don't think i have ten minutes of anything to discuss about what i would do if there was a terrorist attack 

367.81 368.28 A: yeah 

376.01 382.89 A: you know if anything would happen in the d._c. area we are just going to lea- you know like just get out and that type of thing especially like with chemicals 

382.77 384.16 B: now where are you going to go 

384.15 385.43 A: and um 

385.89 387.10 A: um 

387.84 390.53 A: like either g- just i guess leave the area 

390.93 391.81 B: uh-huh 

391.10 398.32 A: i don't know where where we would go but i have see i have this thing where if i'm teaching i'm required to stay in the school 

398.53 406.59 A: you know until and like on nine eleven you know he he worked um over by the airport and they you know they all um 

398.54 399.53 B: yeah 

406.70 411.53 A: a lot of people in this area when nine eleven happened left work and went home 

412.02 412.54 B: mhm 

412.84 420.30 A: and you know i stayed at school the whole day because a lot of my kids were leaving but you know some kids were still there and i just couldn't say well 

421.17 421.76 A: you know 

421.86 429.83 A: there was terrorist attack and i want to go home so um and then we had this thing called shelter in place which means if there was um 

429.54 432.23 B: like a lock down where no one can go in and out 

431.32 434.41 A: yeah sort of like a lock down but it's for you know for the 

434.52 445.67 A: biological type or the chemical wa- you know type thing thinking you know we are shutting off the ventilation systems and how we would decontaminate and this and that and it would be a temporary thing like only like an an 

444.70 448.45 B: now that would be a lot of fun being there and dealing with a bunch of hot 

446.91 447.32 A: and 

447.75 449.24 A: an hour 

448.93 450.14 B: hot sweaty little 

450.25 451.11 B: kids 

450.62 455.11 A: yeah i know you know i mean it's one of those things i think that even though they can plan for it you never know what 

455.26 465.02 A: i- you know until you live it you never know what is going to happen but he seems to think i should just be able to leave when i want to leave and i'm like no it's not going to happen that way so 

461.46 461.92 B: yeah 

466.18 466.85 B: well 

467.95 468.26 A: but 

468.21 468.49 B: i 

468.65 469.24 B: i i would 

469.42 472.87 B: think that if something happened that most parents would come to pick up their children 

472.78 479.19 A: mhm well if it is actually a shelter in place then they can't the parents aren't allowed in the building 

479.52 480.06 B: yeah 

479.98 481.73 A: um because the idea is 

481.17 481.75 B: really 

481.92 491.78 A: like the the building is sealed if there were chemicals outside and it wouldn't be for like you know days or or hours it would they their explanation would be for like 

492.82 496.48 A: oh like you know like half an hour or an hour or maybe two hours 

496.31 496.74 B: yeah 

496.88 499.37 A: you know that the (( )) team would come and 

499.48 503.44 A: you know but i don't know if chemicals were released in the d._c. area i can't imagine 

504.11 506.35 A: that we would have enough (( )) teams to 

506.79 508.45 A: go everywhere do you know what i mean 

508.97 509.73 B: uh-huh
