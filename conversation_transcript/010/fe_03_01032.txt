15.48 20.08 B: so that i would have to say that based on recent events in the united states 

20.27 21.92 B: i think that during a terrorist attack 

22.21 22.68 B: people 

22.81 24.35 B: react no differently then they would 

24.44 24.83 B: say 

25.57 27.15 B: during a bar fire 

27.56 28.50 A: yeah i 

27.79 29.05 B: and they would probably panic 

29.53 30.22 A: exactly 

30.54 34.19 A: well everybody is independent right now as it is anyways about as far as 

34.37 35.39 A: talking about war 

36.26 36.88 B: mhm 

36.91 38.22 A: you know it's been a long time 

40.83 41.73 B: in between wars 

41.88 42.43 A: yeah 

43.88 44.56 A: (( it's not an event )) 

47.35 49.26 B: very true very true 

52.30 59.85 A: and it it to me it's like getting in a fight with a sibling you know (( )) one hits one and then the other hits the other and it's (( )) it's ongoing 

60.16 60.78 A: never stop

67.00 67.53 A: you know 

68.22 72.62 A: and to me war i don't know to to me war is not a solution to anything 

74.09 75.95 B: i i would have to agree with that 

78.65 81.59 B: so during a terrorist attack how do you think that you would react 

82.37 83.95 A: oh i would be totally freaked out 

84.40 87.39 A: i would really totally be freaked out 

87.91 88.83 B: you i (( )) 

87.99 88.73 A: even though i 

89.72 90.26 A: yeah 

89.74 95.66 B: yeah i'm sure i would panic too i can't imagine myself being like one of those people that um 

96.22 99.44 B: like help save other people and stuff i would just be 

99.95 101.87 B: either running away or screaming 

102.09 102.67 A: uh-huh 

103.18 103.67 A: yeah 

103.98 107.81 A: e- exactly and you know y- w- w- where is there to hide though

109.44 110.31 B: what is there to what 

112.70 113.19 B: mhm 

112.70 115.59 A: so where you able to hide during during this attack 

116.87 118.10 A: there's no place to hide 

118.39 119.29 A: you know what i'm saying 

119.92 123.02 B: yeah with the weapons that are available nowadays 

122.31 122.87 A: (( )) 

122.98 123.59 A: yeah 

124.17 125.11 A: that's what scary 

126.21 127.52 A: the the power that they have 

128.92 130.18 A: you know more than anything else 

130.68 133.07 A: it's a destruction that they can do now more 

133.17 134.19 A: than they could earlier 

134.99 135.72 A: in the years 

135.00 135.60 B: mhm 

135.94 137.06 A: that's what's scaring me 

138.69 139.07 A: yeah 

139.42 140.25 A: and it's like with 

139.72 140.07 B: (( )) 

141.93 146.68 A: back when they had (( )) when the new millennium everybody was all freaked out because of the y. two k. 

147.21 147.68 B: uh-huh 

147.77 149.23 A: this is nothing compared to that 

151.87 153.39 B: you mean y. two k. was worse 

153.70 155.12 A: oh no this is worse 

155.55 156.42 B: oh okay 

156.00 157.93 A: this panic is worse that y. two k. was 

158.05 159.33 A: just that was just a joke 

160.27 162.31 B: well yeah 

160.46 160.99 A: to me 

161.46 161.85 A: yeah 

162.74 163.79 B: well 

163.21 163.46 A: but 

164.18 168.21 B: in a way yes i mean there are catastrophic things that could have happened 

168.53 169.05 A: yeah 

169.25 171.18 B: during y. two k. and i actually think that that's 

171.85 174.52 B: an excellent comparison for people to think about 

175.08 175.51 A: well 

175.14 176.91 B: nowadays is the way that we 

177.43 178.78 B: totally overreached 

179.45 182.44 A: oh definitely but this is (( no )) over reaction now 

180.93 181.88 B: to y. two k. 

183.15 183.58 B: pardon 

183.62 186.80 A: i said this is no over reaction now this is retaliation 

188.03 189.31 A: that's how i'm looking at it 

191.65 192.18 A: and in 

192.60 194.15 A: this wishy washiness going back and 

195.83 198.31 A: you know you don't know you're holding your breath are they going to 

198.72 199.09 A: you know 

199.92 202.19 A: start it are they not going to start it or 

203.61 204.03 A: (( )) 

203.70 204.80 B: our government 

204.99 205.51 A: huh

207.84 208.88 A: well yeah 

209.29 210.17 A: you know what i'm saying 

211.06 215.29 B: right we don't know from day to day whether we're going to be in a state of war or not 

211.18 211.87 A: (( wh- whose )) 

215.26 216.00 A: exactly 

216.83 218.21 A: and for the people that have 

218.46 222.20 A: uh family in the military i don't know if you have any family in the military but i do 

222.45 222.93 B: uh-huh 

223.05 224.52 A: um it's really scary 

225.61 226.62 A: you know i don't want 

226.90 228.13 A: i don't want anybody 

228.58 232.59 A: and i don't care if it's somebody i know or somebody i don't know i don't want anybody to have to 

233.11 235.88 A: go to war we lost enough people when when we did that 

236.43 236.93 A: um 

238.22 240.18 A: oh what was it 

239.88 240.52 B: the gulf war 

240.75 241.32 A: yeah 

241.87 242.76 A: that was bad enough 

241.96 245.86 B: but we lost enough we lost enough people in afghanistan as well too 

245.77 246.59 A: oh yeah 

248.45 249.16 A: (( )) it's 

249.77 251.47 A: i mean it's it's getting worse for 

251.56 253.35 A: it's getting worse form year to year 

254.06 254.99 A: as far as this goes 

255.54 256.45 A: and it's not right 

257.10 258.02 A: when is it going to stop 

260.12 260.62 B: (( well i )) 

260.85 261.40 B: think it's 

261.75 262.28 B: human 

262.59 267.59 B: i mean (( )) it's human nature you know just like little kids fight countries fight 

267.68 268.20 A: uh-huh 

271.21 271.70 A: i know 

271.97 277.00 A: that's exactly it you slap my hand i slap yours and it keeps going on and on and on and on and on 

278.09 280.13 A: you know never ending 

281.35 281.76 A: but 

281.47 284.98 B: and i you know i mean that kind of thing it happens in the workplace it happens 

285.65 286.32 A: yeah 

286.48 287.01 A: it does 

287.62 288.43 A: it really does 

288.95 292.19 A: but they y- but but see eh in the work place nobody gets 

292.38 294.79 A: i mean there's people that get affected but not 

295.85 299.43 A: you know eh not to the point where they're losing their lives over it 

296.50 297.39 B: it's not usually 

301.44 303.42 A: you know i mean you may lose your job 

304.29 304.59 A: but 

304.85 305.87 A: losing a job is 

306.22 307.79 A: is nothing compared to losing a life 

308.55 309.22 B: no 

309.78 310.96 A: you know but and 

311.98 316.19 A: i can understand them bringing back in maybe the you know the draft you know that 

316.45 316.71 A: but 

316.46 316.91 B: mhm 

317.14 317.40 A: it 

318.48 320.00 A: because that hasn't been affected 

320.43 322.30 A: since oh my god the sixties 

323.61 326.78 A: you know but the thing of it is is that 

325.37 326.10 B: mhm 

327.97 328.70 A: you know 

329.59 334.45 A: if a country is is going to do something to our country then we should just cut them off completely 

335.64 337.10 A: and find resources somewhere else 

338.96 341.29 A: in instead of you know going back and forth 

341.56 343.09 A: and if another country 

343.71 346.11 A: see that's the other thing that gets me too is that 

346.59 349.61 A: somebody does something in another country they hide out in our country 

350.96 351.55 A: you know 

351.69 352.06 A: and 

353.02 354.05 A: where are we to hide 

354.28 355.89 A: we don't have a country to hide out to 

357.38 361.02 B: well we've set ourselves up as the watch dog and as the 

362.40 365.58 B: um sort of the country that tries to solve everything 

367.98 369.38 A: i know it sounds like the mother huh 

371.33 373.14 B: um yeah 

373.23 377.23 A: i don't know you've got kids but it sounds like the mother (( in the feeling )) you know 

373.68 374.23 B: i think 

377.99 378.44 A: (( you got to )) 

378.14 381.53 B: yeah i i think that's the role that we've set ourselves up in 

381.85 382.39 A: yeah 

382.52 385.70 B: and now you know we expect ourselves to fulfill that role 

386.01 392.84 A: right and i know an and i know it's an extremely hard position for the president to even make or to even think about making 

393.70 394.19 A: that i 

394.67 395.70 A: do not even 

396.11 398.49 A: want to be in his shoes or imagine being in his shoes 

398.99 401.95 A: in anybody's shoes having to make that decision uh for everybody 

404.58 405.54 A: you know on whether or not 

405.95 406.98 A: we're going to go to war 

408.03 410.43 B: well and i yeah i would have 

411.31 412.30 B: major problems with 

412.46 415.80 B: you know all of the lives that were lost and dealing with that 

416.23 416.69 A: yeah 

418.84 422.13 A: well wh- wh- in the long run though what is it what is it going to really accomplish 

423.99 429.33 B: i i don't think that it will nece- i mean it's not going to solve anything there's just going to be another issue 

429.83 430.18 A: yeah 

430.38 431.87 A: because th- you know 

430.52 432.30 B: it comes along 

432.66 433.00 A: yeah 

434.23 436.31 A: because i mean eh he could go 

436.64 439.35 A: you know he could be in one country and then go hide out in a another country 

440.78 444.80 A: and just because his country won't do anything we're going to retaliate against his country 

446.84 447.59 B: or whatever 

447.69 448.93 B: bin laden or 

448.96 450.90 A: yeah well whoever is involved 

452.10 455.05 A: you know in it i mean they're all hiding out i'm sure 

456.98 458.66 A: and you know and bin laden 

459.66 460.90 A: what country is he in now 

461.99 464.20 A: i mean i know he he went to another country 

465.46 469.26 B: well he has to be somewhere or he could still be hiding out in afghanistan you never know 

469.98 470.47 A: yeah 

470.96 471.85 B: in some 

472.76 473.72 B: bunker somewhere 

475.27 477.20 A: yeah so if we you know if we 

477.77 483.47 A: go to war with one country what makes us n- think think you know i mean he might not even be there so what's the point 

486.48 488.15 A: we're going to go to war with all the countries 

488.27 488.98 A: just to find 

489.08 490.04 A: (( )) you know 

491.08 491.94 A: the person down 

492.91 494.78 A: eh it's it's a really hard decision 

494.92 496.51 A: i mean as far as war go 

498.61 499.92 A: eh eh this one especially 

500.72 503.94 A: because they're looking like a you know they're looking for a needle in the haystack basically 

500.80 501.32 B: mhm 

506.19 509.97 B: right well i mean there's other goals that 

511.38 512.81 B: are trying to be accomplished 

514.29 515.32 B: if we go to war 

517.32 517.86 A: i know
