214.61 217.31 A: [laughter] um 

217.57 230.73 A: i mean you know that i i live down here in florida and and there was a lot of talk about you know the different terrorists with supposedly they trained and lived all down here and all of that and and it was one of the things here in town people were worried about was the water supply

274.94 278.64 B: (( i i just think the rural people )) 

278.53 289.73 A: yeah i i live in a pretty pretty small town down here in florida and um but i've lived in in major cities and yeah i definitely think that the different areas would react to things in a in different ways 

289.53 293.78 B: (( will have a tendency just either it's gonna happen to them they're gonna flee or they're gonna buckle down )) 

294.21 298.00 B: (( with their family and just hope for the best or yeah ))

328.41 335.92 A: i i think people who live more rural will just hunker down i i really think they're a lot more sufficient and ah independently thinking 

336.00 342.07 A: so to speak than than people who are with a with a group who you know they say are a you know mob mentality 

341.84 342.96 B: (( talking ))

357.01 367.25 A: i never ever heard what the what the resolution of it was but it was interesting to see how a portion of the people were really freaking out and another portion of the people weren't even getting out of their seats 

367.23 370.02 B: (( it out with my daughter yet )) 

370.08 373.79 B: (( that's just scary i don't really know what my response would ))

390.81 402.68 A: he says well what if something happens when i'm at school i mean i never i mean i didn't grow up in the fifties in the cold war or any of that but it's really sad when your kids thinking about what if something happens when i'm in when i'm at school and i'm not at home and and 

393.67 394.65 B: yeah 

402.77 408.93 A: you know he's just what can you say i mean whoever thought that you'd discuss some of the conversations you'll be having with your kid

411.20 423.74 A: uh-huh i have i have a first grader so they know just enough to be dangerous they don't understand they whole grasp of all but they hear so much about it from here there and everywhere that they their imagination runs with it 

413.53 414.48 B: (( know )) 

415.63 416.59 B: (( times )) 

423.77 427.31 B: (( have changed in our awareness ))

442.88 444.14 B: yeah 

443.02 449.37 A: you know right right to where not not that you know he wasn't afraid of him coming to his house just what will i do if he comes to my school 

449.33 452.97 B: (( premental whatever you can't think of any attack that's ever happened on mainland u._s. soil you know i )) 

452.36 464.06 A: i don't i don't think he understands any of that i think um i think you know they have tornado drills at school and they have hurricane drills at school and fire drills and this is another thing that you they're hearing a lot about 

464.09 467.39 A: you know and it think it's just in the same 

464.26 465.13 B: (( mean in )) 

467.69 469.72 A: in the same vein for him 

469.83 484.63 A: you know what i'm saying it's the same thing as a torna- i mean i i didn't grow up where there were tornadoes i never had a tornado drill before i was what do you do in a tornado drill you know [laughter] and ah i think it's just the same as if it's the same thinking in his mind it's just another thing to be aware of he 

484.73 486.99 A: doesn't seem to be scared about it but 

487.59 493.68 A: but ah but ah who knows you know that just who'd ever think that's what the conversation you'd be having 

493.69 500.50 B: (( the last time that there was an attack er circumstances in world war two and most of us weren't even alive then )) 

501.21 505.48 B: (( so it's our generation on a wake-up call and of course you )) 

505.46 513.29 A: what what we do affects a lot of the world and i don't think i mean i don't think a lot of people realized that before nine one one i really don't 

513.55 514.76 B: (( know )) 

513.63 524.51 A: i think i think people you know the majority of the american public just thought what happens here just affects us and yeah there may be mcdonald's over in all the different foreign countries but that really doesn't mean anything 

524.85 529.19 A: they don't i don't think they understand how much our culture pervades other cultures 

529.40 532.77 A: and makes people do things that they want to do whether good or bad 

532.68 539.20 B: (( [laughter] you set some bio-terrorism on there and everybody's gonna be more )) 

539.40 540.59 A: yeah 

539.46 540.31 B: (( sensitive )) 

540.45 544.08 B: (( and afraid and i hope everybody does keep their ))

559.18 560.15 B: (( aware )) 

560.63 563.79 B: (( of where exits were if there was an earthquake so )) 

565.27 570.09 B: (( that's something that i wasn't used to ))
