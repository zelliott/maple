40.68 41.14 B: do you have thoughts 

41.37 50.94 A: alright well my thoughts as far as comedy there's very limited comedy that i do watch i uh feel that some of them go way overboard uh 

51.24 55.04 A: i eh do not enjoy uh 

55.62 61.91 A: language in the wrong use uh tend to stay with frazier 

58.40 58.83 B: right 

62.20 72.85 A: uh maybe it's light comedy maybe the reason i tend to go to that is because i i feel safe i did like another uh thing but it got tiring was uh 

73.54 79.59 A: that comedy on the father in law and the son in law living in the father in law's house 

79.29 79.81 B: ok 

79.87 84.03 A: and i'm i'm the same way with uh theater too i don't enjoy 

84.55 88.00 A: quote comedy because i sometimes think it does go over the line 

88.09 88.77 B: right 

88.78 89.45 A: how do you feel 

93.45 96.63 A: that's true yes

123.55 123.98 A: right 

124.99 125.57 B: bad taste 

125.70 129.41 B: and eh whether it be culture and the language it's just 

129.55 132.78 B: i mean it's not necessary uh 

132.96 137.88 B: certain shows i i do get a chance to watch once in a while like um everybody loves raymond 

137.97 138.36 A: right 

138.22 139.21 B: i think that's kind of a 

139.32 139.75 B: you know 

139.86 142.72 B: light funny silly type of comedy 

142.93 145.85 B: anything more on the silly line kind of light is is 

146.04 148.97 B: enough humor for me i i don't go too much further than that 

149.16 153.25 A: i know cause it doesn't appear for me to be an escape 

153.38 159.64 A: um for that few minutes of a half an hour to me is eighteen minutes and um 

153.40 154.04 B: right 

157.72 158.51 B: hm mhm
