48.80 49.31 A: right 

52.17 55.79 B: overly sensitive about what's funny and what's not 

55.41 55.70 A: right

70.86 72.02 A: but my husband and i 

72.64 74.81 A: we don't let our children watch things 

75.09 75.66 A: but 

75.89 79.28 A: we watch things that probably everybody wouldn't agree with 

79.19 79.74 B: mm 

79.49 83.30 A: and we still think that they are funny and we're going to watch them in the privacy of our own home 

83.28 83.81 B: right 

83.86 86.37 A: and one of those things is sex in the city 

86.53 87.07 B: mm 

87.13 88.34 A: i think it's hilarious

97.21 98.15 A: you know hum 

98.98 101.52 A: i don't know what the word is i don't really fell like it's hum 

101.96 108.10 A: brain washing us or anything and turning us into heathens or anything but he wouldn't agree with that 

104.73 105.86 B: no 

108.31 111.11 A: and neither would a lot the people that i work with 

110.65 115.54 B: well see i'm i feel the same way i feel that as long as it's done in good taste 

113.07 113.33 A: yea 

116.16 117.78 B: and it's not openly 

117.92 118.72 B: pornographic 

118.94 119.41 A: right 

119.34 123.69 B: i don't have a problem with it now for instance the movie barber shop 

120.70 121.11 A: right 

124.02 124.35 A: yeah 

124.06 127.63 B: now i went to see barber shop i thought it was hilarious 

127.34 127.68 A: right 

127.73 135.70 B: i couldn't understand what the big mess was about because one of the characters in the movie made a joke about rosa parks not being the first one 

135.89 137.75 B: to refuse to move to the back of the bus 

137.72 139.75 A: okay see i haven't seen it but then 

139.35 139.69 B: we- 

140.33 140.84 B: i 

140.58 140.85 A: (( yeah )) 

141.02 144.14 B: i thought it was hilarious i had no problems with it 

142.47 142.78 A: right 

143.96 144.32 A: right 

144.97 148.98 B: there were some about so called political leaders that had a problem with it 

148.76 149.49 A: oh okay 

149.10 150.49 B: to me it was a movie 

150.57 151.07 A: yeah 

150.84 151.79 B: it was a joke 

154.53 154.82 A: right 

157.36 157.72 A: right 

158.86 159.31 A: right 

159.63 163.37 B: to me it was movie it was entertainment it was never intended to be 

163.55 165.35 B: historical documentary 

165.63 165.99 A: right 

166.23 172.17 B: so you know i i think it's really a personal matter but i also feel that people are becoming 

172.83 173.93 A: was too sensitive 

173.62 174.34 B: yes 

174.14 176.03 A: ha ha ha ha (( )) 

174.87 178.93 B: way too sensitive too concerned about political correctness 

178.87 179.32 A: right 

180.14 180.63 B: um 

180.75 186.59 B: and it's a shame because with everything that's going on in the country today i think that people need to be able to laugh 

186.87 187.32 A: right 

188.44 188.79 A: right 

189.02 194.66 A: yeah it's hard to know what to say to people these days ha ha what you can and can't ha you know ha ha 

193.02 195.52 B: it really is it really is because 

194.96 196.87 A: not that i'm going to say anything that i thi- 

198.21 198.70 A: is 

198.83 203.92 A: you know offensive or anything but um you never know ha what somebody's go- ha 

208.10 217.90 B: and i think about things that we used to make jokes about and things that we used to saw to one another and nobody had a problem with it but i know wouldn't dare do it now because now people want to sue you 

214.34 214.68 A: right 

218.05 218.36 A: right 

218.68 221.47 B: they want to they want to have you fired from your job 

221.35 221.74 A: right 

222.21 222.51 B: i me- 

222.24 222.56 A: right 

222.63 229.93 B: this nation as a whole i think has become overly sensitive about everything but particularly when it comes to jokes and comedy 

230.39 232.92 B: it's like people are just going to the extreme 

233.04 233.41 A: right 

234.06 236.00 A: now there things though that i don't want to hear 

236.25 236.74 A: you know 

237.24 237.94 A: and 

238.58 240.97 A: you know a- but that is my personal opinion 

241.19 241.68 B: mhm 

241.47 242.72 A: i'm not going to you know tha- 

242.94 245.06 A: you know i can get up and i can move away from something 

245.12 245.61 B: mhm 

245.52 252.48 A: you know ha i mean that i doesn't mean that i have put my personal opinion on everybody else you know ha ha ha 

252.80 253.49 A: yeah ha 

253.88 261.97 B: this is supposed to be a country where we're free to do and listen to things as we want as long as they're legal and just because i don't want to hear something doesn't mean that i think 

256.01 256.37 A: right 

258.52 258.87 A: right 

262.29 263.22 B: it should be (( censor- )) 

263.48 263.82 A: right 

264.46 264.71 A: right 

270.47 270.74 A: right 

274.47 277.98 B: i can go along with it some of these comedians just get carried away 

275.60 276.08 A: oh yeah 

277.80 278.11 A: yeah 

278.36 282.44 B: you know every other word is a curse word or s- an- th- and i think that 

280.74 281.06 A: right 

282.65 289.93 B: that's really unnecessary but sometimes an- you know i was looking at star search a few weeks ago and one of the comedians used uh 

283.90 284.23 A: right 

290.42 290.95 B: the word 

291.11 293.50 B: i think he said a hoe or something like that 

293.65 299.25 B: and one of the judges said you know well i didn't particularly care for your comedy because it was too blue and i'm like 

300.16 304.64 B: blue he used one word he said like whore or hoe or so- 

300.68 301.45 A: ha 

302.09 303.38 A: yeah ha ha ha 

304.17 304.53 A: yeah 

304.87 305.89 B: i mean w- i guess 

306.03 313.60 B: she would never listen to like andrew dice clay or richard prier where every other word is a curse word 

309.22 310.92 A: (( )) oh yeah ha ha ha 

312.55 312.99 A: right 

313.69 317.06 A: and some of that can be offensive but you know what ha ha 

316.79 317.40 B: yeah 

317.32 323.99 A: ah you know nobody's going to make me listen to it you know if i don't want to and um you know but you know it's it's 

319.49 320.09 B: that's right 

324.59 325.01 A: (( some i )) 

325.17 327.71 A: personal preference now i- you know i don't want to see 

328.01 328.98 A: i don't want to see people 

329.11 330.01 A: kids in there 

330.07 330.43 B: no 

330.24 330.97 A: you know 

331.19 333.30 A: i mean i've got small children and 

333.61 335.96 A: i have to deal with kids everyday and 

336.11 339.68 A: um i work with kids my husband's a teacher and 

340.12 341.60 A: i think that's a lot of the problem 

341.70 347.48 A: i mean i've had a really bad day today because of some problems with some of the kids i've been having to deal with and and 

346.39 346.95 B: mhm 

347.59 348.46 A: you know that 

348.79 351.86 A: i think that all of this stuff is the r- you know 

352.05 361.52 A: parents (( )) just let them do whatever they want to these days you know i mean if they want to listen to it but their parents don't well okay you know if you want to ha ha ha ha 

353.96 354.49 B: mhm 

354.80 355.23 B: yeah 

360.60 367.87 B: that's it i mean there has to be some parental control and parents taking responsibility for what they listen to an- and see on t._v. and 

362.16 362.77 A: yeah ha 

363.73 364.07 A: right 

366.29 366.73 A: right 

367.55 367.86 A: right 

367.98 372.21 B: and there are a lot of good comedy shows on television that are not offensive 

372.35 375.27 A: if you can find them around the reality t._v. ha ha 

374.27 380.60 B: right ha ha this is true now if you ask me some of the reality t._v. is where the real comedy is ha 

375.50 376.56 A: ha ha 

376.68 377.12 A: ha 

379.40 382.88 A: well an- yeah and i'll watch the stuff and i i i probably shouldn't admit that 

385.03 386.58 B: ha ha ha ha ha 

392.02 396.75 A: this um the past couple of weeks it's been hard to find any sitcoms on ha ha 

395.98 398.30 B: i- it has it really has an- and 

398.61 409.45 B: i've been having a trouble my train of thought is not that great so about all i can deal with recently is you know like thirty minutes of watching something so for me that's a good sitcom and i needed something to laugh 

401.49 401.97 A: uh- huh 

408.30 408.58 A: right 

409.19 409.56 A: right 

409.92 411.18 B: my problem is it seems like 

411.40 416.59 B: the the sitcoms that come on that i enjoy and i think are funny are the ones that they seem to take off right away 

416.88 420.02 A: yeah ah i don't even know what sitcoms are on right now because um 

420.32 428.13 A: there's been so much of the reality t._v. on and we watch we watch some of the dramas that are been on right now like twenty four we watch that and um 

422.63 423.27 B: yeah 

428.37 435.46 A: we've watched that for a couple of seasons (( )) know what good i mean i guess friends is still on maybe i you know i don't know ha ha ha ha 

432.87 438.10 B: yeah and it's i- it made it time for it to go cause for me it's not as funny as it used to be 

436.24 436.57 A: yeah 

437.93 439.80 A: see i hadn't watched it in a couple of years 

439.53 449.73 B: yeah it's it's not th- i don't think the the comedy is the comedy writing is the quality that it was in it's earlier years and th- they had said that this would probably be the last year but now they're saying it may go for another year 

449.60 450.16 A: oh okay 

450.12 453.98 B: but uh i just don't think that the comedy is as good as it used to be 

453.93 456.59 A: well one of my favorite one's right now that i do 

456.71 459.33 A: can't think of off the top of my head is um malcolm in the middle 

459.81 462.23 B: i've never even watched malcolm in the middle ha 

460.77 465.28 A: you haven't well i think it's hilarious but it's about a family you know and um 

464.41 465.00 B: mhm 

472.12 483.40 A: um but it's not like the cussing and stuff like that you know none of that kind of stuff it's pretty pretty wholesome as far as shows like that go and i think its l- and you know i'll l- i let my kids watch that you know 

474.80 475.40 B: mhm 

482.94 483.49 B: mhm 

483.76 486.24 A: now i'd never let them come in and watch sex in the city with us 

486.35 491.53 A: ha we watch that after they go to bed you know ha ha 

486.76 487.88 B: um na- well and tha- 

488.63 489.11 B: yeah 

489.56 497.08 B: an- an- and that's the thing about being a good parent you draw the line on what's the kind of comedy the family can watch as a whole and what 

497.19 498.84 B: is there for parents to watch 

498.81 499.10 A: right 

499.74 500.33 A: right 

500.41 505.09 B: and making sure that you monitor to make sure that your kids are not watching things that are not appropriate 

505.10 505.47 A: right 

505.80 507.58 A: right and um 

507.74 509.50 A: as far as kids t._v. right now 

509.73 512.97 A: there's not a whole lot of it so ha ha we 

511.61 518.37 B: wh- you know that's what i don't that there's really not a lot for kids to look at unless you're going to let them watch cartoons all the time 

515.50 515.79 A: no 

517.50 518.24 A: right 

518.38 518.74 A: right 

519.29 524.40 A: and now mine um mine are still younger i mean i have one in school one in preschool but um 

525.03 529.41 A: you know we we don't even have cable that's just a decision we've made um 

529.55 532.34 A: not really because of the money necessarily but just because 

532.58 539.09 A: we let them watch c._p._t._v. and you know stuff like that and there's plenty of that on for them to watch you know 

535.68 536.17 B: mhm 

539.83 547.27 A: there's things i'd like to see on cable but see if i had cable i'd be watching the home and garden network and stuff like that you know not for uh 

543.86 545.41 B: hm hm hm hm hm 

547.53 552.04 A: you know the um movie channels or anything like that you know 

549.58 550.32 B: right 

551.57 556.03 B: well i enjoy watching comedy central they had some good comedians on there um 

554.95 556.45 A: oh yeah i've s- yeah 

556.58 557.17 A: mhm 

556.64 565.00 B: that i really enjoy me i watched one oh i think it was sunday i just happened to be flicking through and wanda sikes is doing this comedy thing and and part of her 

570.14 570.59 A: right 

575.84 579.91 B: her comedy also related to everyday things in life that you can you can relate to 

579.98 580.30 A: right 

580.28 588.08 B: and that i real- that's when i enjoy comedy the most when it is funny and you realize oh my goodness i've done that or i've seen that 

583.46 583.75 A: right 

588.36 588.79 A: right 

588.88 589.53 B: you know but 

589.72 592.22 B: that's also often when people start getting 

592.48 593.23 B: too sensitive 

593.38 593.68 A: right 

594.51 597.83 A: so i- in my opinion where i would draw the line
