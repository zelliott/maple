55.23 62.17 A: so i kind of i guess i'm going to be one of those last call people that are gonna be like kind of like once the red alert happens 

62.28 70.01 A: or if it ever happens let's pray to god that it don't then i'll panic and them go oh my gosh i have to get i get and them go from there 

70.41 70.81 B: um 

71.39 77.61 B: well i i um i was in the military and i have a i was a paramedic for seven years 

75.04 75.74 A: oh 

78.10 80.41 B: and i have a relative who 

80.53 84.69 B: um pretty strong background in emergency care 

84.88 86.02 B: but um 

86.27 95.59 B: terrorism is something that i don't think that you can really prepare for i mean that's basically the definition of terrorism being able to put

93.71 94.26 A: right 

95.75 102.91 B: fear in us whenever because we can't really do a whole lot about it and as long as were basically prepared with 

103.17 103.95 B: i have a 

104.18 104.52 B: a 

104.80 105.93 B: basically a couple 

106.07 111.44 B: a days worth of water supply saved and other than that a basic 

112.71 121.74 B: i've told my wife if something was to occur (( )) we have a point of of our home as the place a a center of a place where we should meet 

122.45 129.84 B: and some basic ideas of what would be the wisest action we should take and and how long we should stay 

130.37 132.02 B: at a situation um 

132.15 133.26 B: to figure that 

133.66 135.37 B: something had occurred to one of us 

135.49 137.54 B: to proceed to a um 

137.99 140.41 B: another family members place in a more 

140.96 150.50 B: isolated area so that we could get out of a concentrated city area because that's where i believe the biggest problem is going to occur is because of the 

149.32 149.74 A: right 

150.62 152.41 B: um lack of police 

153.53 155.47 B: presence i mean i mean i 

155.77 156.70 B: it's kind of like you know tha- 

156.87 160.42 B: thing that just happened in chicago where somebody sprayed mace and 

160.17 164.34 A: yes everybody panicked and and trampled everything so 

160.62 161.29 B: twenty some 

162.59 167.04 B: that's where all of the death is going to come from is not from the (( )) not from the 

164.83 166.64 A: think everybody will panic 

167.24 167.75 B: terrorists 

168.28 169.90 B: but from people panicking 

170.37 174.92 B: is that's where the biggest problem is going to come not i mean that's that's how 

174.50 179.90 A: people will be like getting in their cars trying to get out of town but not really know where to even go 

179.72 180.60 B: right 

180.75 181.60 B: um 

181.73 184.50 B: i don't do you live in a suburb or a city area 

187.59 188.21 A: st louis 

188.71 193.58 A: but i mean let's just say a point of interest the st louis arch i'm fifteen miles 

193.74 202.56 B: well you're in a pretty you're in a pretty good area just on the fact that you have large running body of water so that you don't have to worry about 

194.76 195.79 A: so i mean in a sense 

200.82 201.44 A: right 

202.74 209.96 B: i mean i mean cause that's going to be your first lost of something that you your first necessities are you're water supply and your basic 

210.59 211.05 B: you know 

211.45 214.43 B: you're very first basic needs is what's gonna really 

214.57 220.18 B: be effective first and i don't really see i don't i just really worry about the terrorist enough to think that 

220.66 221.22 B: um 

221.97 225.48 B: th- to your neighbor and the people around us are gonna be wh- 

226.16 228.17 B: it is the panic that is going to hurt us 

228.23 230.67 A: i think it will be sheer panic because 

231.30 233.77 A: i'm kind of ignorant on the subject to be honest 

234.71 245.60 A: i mean i am and my husband's very laid back and he'll be like ah you know don't worry things will be fine things will be fine things will be fine but i'll be here like oh my god the kids my mom my grandma 

245.50 247.70 B: well how old are your kids 

246.42 246.83 A: (( )) 

247.73 250.62 A: i have a three year old and a six year old 

250.64 255.30 B: and so are they um your six year old is basically getting old enough to 

261.75 262.90 A: very much so 

261.91 269.06 B: kind of relay some of the information but three year old is we have a four and a five and so there is just no way that we felt that 

269.16 269.64 B: um 

270.05 272.27 B: other than watching fox news 

272.19 272.87 A: right 

272.51 280.39 B: i'm kind of r- i i'm pretty much a um conservative on mo- most of my ways of thought 

280.52 282.88 B: and so i just don't think that 

283.01 287.40 B: terrorism is going to be something that is going to hurt us i think that we're going to hurt ourselves 

287.95 288.58 A: yeah 

288.65 291.92 B: and a- another thing is that i think that 

292.74 297.18 B: a here is something that is a little far off i believe that the best defense is a good offense 

298.18 300.16 B: against this type of 

300.28 304.27 B: problem and i think if we approach it as if we keep the 

304.52 307.68 B: enemy of ours the enemies or the 

308.25 310.71 B: the enemies of america on the run 

311.37 313.83 B: more then what we do is let them 

314.70 322.25 B: a come back together and reform and wherever it is whether or not you believe in the war or not it's going to happen 

322.41 330.59 B: whether it's today tomorrow or five years from now were going to be confronted with saddam hussein or someone like him 

330.76 331.66 A: exactly 

331.27 338.46 B: and so unless there is a price to paid it- i- it's just like children unless they know there is a consequence to there actions 

338.61 339.88 B: they're going to act 

340.19 342.46 B: exactly how they feel they can get away with acting 

343.71 345.34 B: and so i i don't 

345.80 352.73 B: i'm i'm pretty much pro-war right know not that i'm pro-war i really hat the idea that we're gonna be going over there but i do believe that we should 

353.67 354.77 B: take care of business 

355.79 357.44 B: and that's the cost of freedom 

355.94 357.59 A: i i'm fifty fifty 

358.86 366.12 A: i mean i like i said i'm very ignorant on the subject so i really don't feel qualified to make that decision 

366.25 377.26 A: i'm mean i am concerned about the innocent lives and everything and then it's like if we go and bomb them are we gonna be turning right around and spending millions of dollars to rebuild 

377.49 379.33 A: you know everything we bomb 

377.62 378.63 B: well yeah we are but 

379.02 380.91 B: exactly we are going to but 

380.13 382.45 A: and i just i have a problem with that 

382.54 390.65 B: okay but how about if we look at it this way are we not gonna be rebuilding from wherever the bombings gonna be do you want to have to rebuild 

390.85 392.17 B: los angeles or 

392.32 393.01 B: baghdad 

393.03 403.97 A: now see and i do and i see the point there and that makes good sense i would rather be bui- rebuilding baghdad but i still feel very sorry for those innocent lives but i 

403.54 404.66 B: exactly and 

404.18 410.93 A: but i'd rather but i mean how do you chose a- a- an innocent life i mean that's what just upsets me 

408.71 411.83 B: th- the whole thing of it is is that is that's 

412.02 416.94 B: the understanding of freedom is ther- is that is always 

412.15 413.68 A: that's just what war is 

417.05 420.46 B: the problem with war is it's not the people who are going to war 

420.82 427.16 B: it's the collateral people i mean it's the people who have they're sons there daughters there 

423.44 423.85 A: any 

426.32 429.60 A: yeah the military i mean my gosh i mean i have such 

429.72 430.88 A: respect 

431.33 433.02 A: for you know all the people over there 

433.52 434.30 A: and i just see a 

434.40 436.79 A: scares the crap out off me and think my gash 

435.45 439.72 B: well i do- i it really is sad th- you know what would be best 

440.00 443.58 B: i'm mean i think there would be best if everybody just sit down and said 

443.72 446.18 B: just like you and i we come from totally different cultures 

446.96 454.23 B: totally different ideas on um not totally different cultures i shouldn't say that i imagine you're you're more of along 

452.38 462.18 A: well i mean i mean you have a military background and you are ve- you know observant at what's going on around you you understand more you probably pay attention to the news more than me 

462.55 469.81 A: you know here i am just your stay at home mom who is kind of ignorant on the subject who you know is (( trying )) 

468.57 472.10 B: well no because you're price is going to be the same as my price 

472.38 472.93 A: right 

472.42 476.31 B: and my family is at risk the same as your family 

474.58 475.51 A: exactly 

477.16 479.82 B: we're both gonna be part of the collateral damage 

479.77 480.30 A: true 

480.11 480.70 B: (( )) 

480.79 486.46 B: if there is not something done i mean this this is another way i kind of compare it with 

486.58 488.40 B: you know whenever your brakes start going bad 

488.48 489.25 A: mhm 

488.64 489.33 B: and this is a 

490.00 490.37 B: (( )) 

491.39 491.70 B: hello 

491.90 493.29 A: okay i didn't hear you on that one 

492.89 496.61 B: okay this is as simple as i can make it once your brakes start going bad 

497.45 499.31 B: then it's usually less 

499.50 500.34 B: costly 

501.03 502.16 B: (( )) the problem right away 

503.08 503.71 A: okay 

503.17 503.57 B: right 

510.79 519.86 B: it then the problem just increases and magnifies itself and pr- pretty soon it just snowballs into something that how big are we going to let it get 

520.36 521.86 B: before we actually 

522.41 523.90 B: do something about it or 

524.03 526.02 B: are we ever going to do to anything about it 

526.57 528.05 A: and thats a very good analogy 

528.54 534.97 B: i mean i i just know that it's gonna be costly but is gonna be costing more five years from now or how about this 

535.08 538.79 B: would it cost less if george bush the first would of took care of the problem in the first place 

540.29 545.86 B: i mean realistically looking at it i think that it would of cost everybody less i mean in retrospect 

546.11 547.73 B: with we all have twenty twenty bu- 

547.93 548.46 A: right 

547.99 551.16 B: in retrospect it would have cost less if we would of took care of the problem the first time 

551.49 552.09 A: right 

552.10 553.38 B: but now that we're here 

554.65 555.73 B: um 

556.00 559.16 B: i prefer peace but i think passive just gets us into 

559.69 561.83 B: a a situation that is gonna hurt all of us 

562.20 562.66 B: more 

563.15 564.42 B: then what it is um 

564.95 567.84 B: and it's sad that the iraqis or 

567.97 571.62 B: the muslim nation over there is gonna feel the sting of it but 

572.10 572.58 B: um 

573.08 575.47 B: i i believe our freedom has always cost 

576.06 578.95 B: and it's gonna continue to cost and for them to be free 

579.15 580.56 B: it's gonna continue to cost 

581.31 582.19 B: and so 

583.13 584.30 B: that's basically how i feel 

585.33 587.02 A: well i'm learning something tonight 

587.92 592.83 A: i'm it's interesting i i turned down a phone call yesterday because i was afraid to talk on it
