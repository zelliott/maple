0.46 1.70 B: hello 

1.15 2.34 A: hello 

2.19 4.05 B: hi my name is marsha 

3.84 6.51 A: hi my name's angela [laughter] 

5.49 10.71 B: [laughter] hi um so we're supposed to talk about what's appropriate comedy and inappropriate 

10.12 12.64 A: yeah where we draw the line at um 

12.75 14.15 B: okay um 

14.38 17.83 B: where where do you think that the line should be drawn and what do you say 

16.44 19.53 A: i think i think that if it's like in a s- 

19.99 29.69 A: sexual thing [laughter] i think it that's where i draw the line at ah to be in comedy [laughter] because to me it that that's just that they've gone a little bit too far [laughter] 

24.64 26.55 B: right right i 

29.67 41.76 B: right i i agree on that um i think that if if you wouldn't want your mom to sit and watch it with you i think that that that's what makes it inappropriate that if you were uncomfortable with a parent sitting there then 

41.68 44.70 A: yes very true because if you don't want them 

43.33 44.44 B: [laughter] 

44.87 46.95 A: being them uncomfortable you know 

47.20 49.15 A: oh god yeah [laughter] 

48.73 56.82 B: right so yeah i think that's definitely one thing um another thing that i find um sort of inappropriate is racial comedy 

57.09 64.80 B: because it it's okay for say an an african american person to make fun of a white person but you know if a white person 

62.89 65.74 A: but then we can't do it to them and 

64.97 66.07 B: right 

66.08 70.56 B: right that's terribly yeah that's bad [laughter] 

66.81 71.31 A: i understand i understand yeah that's very bad [laughter] 

71.01 73.07 B: [laughter] um 

73.43 75.87 B: i think a lot of um 

76.26 81.56 B: comedy that's ah geared towards children today is actually very inappropriate 

81.71 89.24 B: um i've watched a lot of cartoons that um the kids are like you know smarting off to the parents and that's funny 

89.26 90.42 B: and you know that's 

89.39 91.37 A: because they learn it from the cartoon 

91.53 95.81 B: right it's not you know that wouldn't happen in my household and 

91.85 94.16 A: i've seen that yeah 

94.85 105.89 A: oh no that's not gonna happen in mine [laughter] i'm gonna like what did you just say no er where did you learn that okay you're not watching that one anymore [laughter] 

96.78 98.63 B: [laughter] you know 

99.88 101.52 B: yeah exactly 

103.21 104.36 B: [laughter] 

104.58 106.99 B: exactly exactly 

107.77 112.05 B: yeah i think yeah that's definitely a problem [laughter] 

109.80 112.24 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

112.90 114.53 A: oh god 

114.47 115.62 B: mhm 

115.89 118.15 A: (( how long are we supposed to talk oh eight )) 

118.32 119.77 B: eight minutes 

118.92 121.50 A: (( minutes um [laughter] yeah that's a lot hard subject )) 

121.52 124.55 B: it it is hard to talk on for [laughter] eight minutes 

123.48 127.54 A: for eight minutes i mean you could talk about that like in no time but um 

129.23 131.99 B: okay um we can talk about 

132.41 139.41 B: who who do you find like in comedians today who do you find that you know you don't really enjoy listening to 

139.78 140.71 A: um 

140.12 141.74 B: is there anybody in particular 

142.67 145.17 A: (( i don't remember his name ah what was that guy's )) 

149.39 152.59 A: (( name who do you and then maybe i i it might pop my my )) 

152.60 156.82 B: um i i actually watched a d._v._d. of robin williams 

156.79 159.12 A: really you do not like robin williams 

158.99 166.53 B: he on this d._v._d. it is unrated because because of the material and it was really just disgusting 

161.74 162.66 A: really 

166.57 176.27 B: like i i watched it and i was like you know can we turn this off because it was totally sexual and just some of the words used were just like totally vulgar and i'm like this is not funny to me 

175.89 177.20 A: really 

176.89 178.35 B: (( yeah that surprised me because i i haven't )) 

179.96 184.65 B: seen that yeah it's um a a show he did on broadway i believe and 

184.72 187.32 B: oh yeah i didn't enjoy that too much 

187.12 188.90 A: yeah i wouldn't either 

188.93 189.76 B: hm 

188.96 190.66 A: okay um 

194.05 194.82 B: (( [cough] )) 

194.39 197.68 A: the one i'm thinking about is a black guy i don't remember his name though 

197.72 199.33 B: chris rock or 

198.75 202.57 A: yeah chris rock yeah yeah ah 

200.44 202.63 B: chris rock [laughter] 

202.59 209.64 A: he just goes off sometimes and i just wanna go in there and like straight on like don't be saying that that's not funny but [mn] 

208.11 211.62 B: [laughter] yeah some um 

211.85 216.01 B: it just depends like especially on the age levels of the viewers 

215.73 226.90 A: yeah i mean because they they're gonna i don't think they stop to think hey kids are gonna to be watching this and hey they're gonna be going out and saying and repeating this to their friends and then its going to be getting around and i 

225.44 232.23 B: right and and that's funny it's funny to use those words but when you actually use them when the kids are saying them it's 

232.34 234.76 B: you know it's gonna be a whole different story 

234.16 242.00 A: yeah i mean it's not like they're gonna want their kids saying it i mean that that that's just it just contradicts what [laughter] they're doing 

237.48 239.15 B: right exactly 

242.03 243.10 B: right 

243.18 243.96 A: so 

244.62 245.50 A: (( ah ah )) 

245.88 253.28 B: yeah but yeah i definitely think it all goes back to the if if you would enjoy watching something with your mom 

253.37 256.20 B: then i think that that would make it appropriate 

255.76 263.27 A: yeah because if the parents would enjoy it you know you're going to because they're basically strict on everything so 

259.88 265.04 B: right if you'd be if you'd be right if you'd be embarrassed while 

265.05 267.58 B: you know like oh can we turn this now i think 

266.26 280.04 A: oh like i can't believe i just watched that with my mom i can't believe they said that in front of my mom yeah believe me i've been there [laughter] i've been there watching stuff and and then a comedian just say something and i'm looking at my mom like okay is she laughing or i- i- 

271.58 272.86 B: yeah 

273.65 274.73 B: [laughter] 

279.42 281.36 B: [laughter] 

280.10 284.77 A: i- or i- i- is she getting mad [laughter] 

283.25 285.11 B: yeah definitely 

285.05 286.90 A: so yeah 

286.26 288.32 B: [laughter] ah 

287.92 294.77 A: and i don't agree too much when they bring in religion into the comedian stuff i don't i i think 

293.13 295.41 B: [noise] no i i agree with you on that 

294.96 303.46 A: i think they need to stay away from it because that is on any religion like i mean it just it's it's it's a bad thing i think [laughter] 

302.40 306.45 B: right it's a very sensitive subject to make l- 

305.37 307.68 A: very sensitive i mean 

306.81 312.60 B: and to make light of somebody's religion i mean that your spirituality is very 

312.70 313.38 B: (( [mn] )) 

314.37 321.93 B: personal and to m- to make fun of somebody's personal belief i think is you know kind of crossing the line 

315.21 316.25 A: mhm 

323.42 324.81 B: but you know 

325.03 332.53 B: it it all depends i think that the people that enjoy comedy like that are people that aren't spiritual and don't have a particular 

331.18 335.72 A: very i i i i i agree with you on that one i think there is a there is 

333.85 334.95 B: right 

335.01 337.86 B: because it's it's not important to them so 

336.60 345.51 A: it's not important to it's funny to them and i think that's that's basically like for everything for anything that they they make a joke out of i mean if 

345.44 353.80 A: if it's not important to you about other people's feelings then you're gonna talk about that person and you're gonna put him down and and make a joke of him or whatever i mean 

353.84 356.12 B: that's very true that's interesting 

356.48 357.74 B: [sigh] hm 

357.85 367.96 B: yeah yeah [laughter] i agree on the religion [laughter] um i think i think generally that we could say that it's anything that is important to you 

359.19 360.16 A: [laughter] 

368.15 380.48 B: like personally is what you know you don't find funny like i i think that personal integrity is very important to me so when people make sexual comments and stuff you know make light of that it it offends me 

378.88 392.74 A: [laughter] yeah it does me too because i've like because i've had it happen to me before you know they'll be a bunch of people on and they'll all be laughing and then they'll look at me like you don't think that's funny and i'm like no i did not i thought that was you know disgusting 

380.87 381.76 B: so 

392.69 394.94 B: right exactly 

393.42 403.84 A: that was that that was rude for me to have and then they were like oh you know you need to lighten up [mn] and i'm like no you need to respect me for my views [laughter] 

400.49 402.30 B: [laughter] 

403.50 405.50 B: that's yeah that's very true 

406.28 407.98 B: yeah um 

408.29 413.76 B: i think i think a lot of the time that comedians get caught up in what's popular 

414.28 421.56 B: like you know it's very popular to advertise sex right now so that's what funny it's funny to make jokes about that so 

418.66 419.63 A: yeah 

420.87 425.00 A: or funny to make er or or or about somebody's weight or 

425.08 426.34 B: right 

425.12 430.95 A: the color of their hair or you know or the way they act or 

428.12 429.82 B: but that 

430.00 435.61 B: i've seen that a lot lately is the the um fat jokes sort of is um 

436.20 440.53 B: a lot of the larger comedians will make fun of themselves 

440.94 444.40 B: and i'm watching like do you not have any self respect 

444.65 450.34 B: you know you must not like yourself very much if you can sit and make a joke about what you look like 

451.42 454.04 A: well then some people would argue that um 

454.69 459.62 A: on that fact that er that they are comfortable with themselves and that's why they can do that 

460.29 467.05 B: right i i can understand that but you know a lot of the time i think it's that people 

467.79 474.85 B: larger people will expect people to make a judgment about them so to make light of it they make a joke about it 

475.54 485.11 B: which i'm i'm i'm sure that many people who are you know plus size or larger i'm sure that many of them are comfortable but at the same time i just don't really see 

485.60 492.42 B: like comfort in their eyes when they talk about their weight i see sort of like an excuse to you know get around the subject and 

491.61 492.67 A: yeah 

492.73 495.36 B: so that they won't be made fun of 

494.61 495.76 A: yeah okay 

496.56 498.56 B: (( hm okay did that sound right )) 

498.27 499.58 A: (( yeah that that's )) 

500.32 501.34 A: (( okay [laughter] do you )) 

503.52 505.45 B: okay i think it's been ten minutes 

504.87 510.49 A: think i don't know [laughter] i figured maybe they'd come on and say you you know time's up 

509.88 513.22 B: yeah your time is up now you may stop talking 

512.77 515.84 A: i didn't even start timing it i was like okay [laughter] 

515.90 522.26 B: i know i it they called on my cell phone and so i'm like okay ten minutes i think i can pay for that [laughter] 

521.07 522.48 A: [laughter] 

523.20 524.08 A: (( ah )) 

523.59 528.02 B: hm let's see it's five ten do you know about what time they called

537.84 539.79 B: uh-hum okay 

538.52 539.56 A: so 

539.62 540.99 A: i don't know 

542.11 543.25 B: well 

543.38 548.50 B: let see we could talk about one more subject then we'll call it we'll see if you know it interrupts or anything 

548.10 548.94 A: (( okay )) 

549.41 550.88 B: okay um 

549.58 550.39 A: (( [mn] )) 

552.60 556.90 B: maybe we should talk about what is appropriate since we've talked about like what isn't 

556.18 557.11 A: yeah 

557.47 558.65 B: um 

561.94 562.84 B: (( [sigh] )) 

562.92 571.72 B: [noise] i i just personally like anything that's light hearted like i don't like anything that's too like derogatory towards anyone 

572.46 573.41 B: you know 

572.83 575.33 A: mm yeah i understand 

575.33 585.89 B: like i think it's funny when you know people act stupid or you know do funny things but it's not funny to me when its like oh look look at that person over there aren't they funny 

584.42 594.03 A: yeah that that that to me i don't think it's funny at all i mean ah and people do it all the time and then then then a lot of people laugh with tho- that person just so that you know they 

594.05 596.91 A: you know are with their friends but i don't 

597.68 599.90 B: (( its because it's not them in in that )) 

599.32 599.90 A: yeah
