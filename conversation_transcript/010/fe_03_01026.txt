0.46 1.32 B: (( he- )) 

0.58 3.08 A: hello my name is rose 

2.54 4.24 B: hi rose this is deb 

4.43 5.78 A: and how are you doing 

5.32 6.60 B: i'm good you 

6.76 12.52 A: oh this topic has probably been on everyone's mind quite a bit lately with the 

11.61 13.52 B: yeah i think you're right 

12.89 14.37 A: with the upcoming 

14.79 17.01 A: war eminent as it is 

16.64 18.78 B: yes [sigh] yeah 

18.28 19.07 A: so 

19.33 23.98 A: i don't know about your feelings but i think that people would probably 

24.00 26.46 A: first be in shock and then panic 

26.94 29.84 B: ah i think you're probably right um 

30.09 32.97 B: i i really don't think we've learned a whole lot 

33.54 35.85 B: and i i think that um 

36.64 46.60 B: i think that's kinda sad because it you know the the first attack that we had on september eleventh of course shook us to the bones because we weren't expecting anything 

46.95 47.86 B: and 

46.99 51.95 A: oh i know it was like so out of the blue we're so trusting americans 

49.69 50.64 B: yeah 

51.99 56.63 B: we really are in in in the full scheme of things and i think that um 

56.92 58.63 B: what would end up happening 

59.61 61.82 B: [mn] is that we might get 

62.89 68.83 B: over the shock a little bit quicker but um i i don't know if it would [mn] 

70.00 76.29 B: if we would learn to trust any more or to let go of some of it i don't think we've become any more cynical 

76.79 81.99 A: yeah i think it i think one more time would just kinda push everybody over the edge 

81.57 83.46 B: yeah exactly 

82.93 87.88 A: it's like the first time it was such a shock and now it seems like such a long time ago but 

88.07 88.93 A: um 

88.98 90.17 A: and 

90.42 93.56 A: i think we all expected something to happen right away 

93.28 94.24 B: right 

93.85 99.92 A: you know like in the first few months but nothings happened it's just going going and i almost think that's part of their 

100.49 105.57 A: element of surprise just waiting 'til we're not expecting it and just let us have it [laughter] 

105.70 108.99 B: i i think you're right my my husband's in the service 

109.25 111.74 B: and i can actually say um 

112.52 114.42 B: i i want this to happen 

114.84 116.67 B: because i don't want 

117.73 119.43 B: i don't wanna have to 

120.11 122.25 B: wait f- you know for 

122.58 127.46 B: another decade or something like that until they decide that we've become complacent again 

127.32 129.28 A: oh i know they're they're 

129.40 130.26 A: they 

130.58 133.89 A: their mind set is so different from americans 

134.19 138.64 B: you know and i i i haven't figured out why they just absolutely hate us so much 

134.31 135.08 A: and 

138.73 142.16 A: i think jealousy and um i mean y- look at our 

142.14 156.33 A: look at our commercials even on t._v. everyone's happy full of life and y- they never have that type of life over there it's always just constant fear constant wars con- constant aggravation um 

156.31 158.72 A: they never get a chance to enjoy their life 

158.69 160.01 B: no they don't 

159.70 164.37 A: it's it's pretty sad i i'm very thankful i'm an american 

164.44 166.17 B: yeah i agree um 

165.43 166.28 A: [laughter] 

166.38 167.59 A: it's ah 

167.46 170.83 B: yeah exactly exactly i i don't know how 

171.41 176.94 B: how how they exist like they do the the sad thing is is that it doesn't have to be like that 

177.26 184.13 A: i know but it it's kind of like the communism countries they didn't know any better better until they were able to 

184.15 187.17 B: well that's that's why we need to get the people out 

184.72 186.16 A: be free from that 

186.98 189.43 A: oh i think you're really right on that one 

189.22 195.18 B: you know so that these people do r- learn to realize that there there's a there is another way of life and it's a better one 

195.22 200.89 B: and instead of hating us so much you know it's kinda like take out your garbage first 

201.44 202.32 B: (( you know )) 

201.51 203.61 A: oh yeah exactly 

204.11 212.14 A: but they're they're so brainwashed they're in a way they're just like little children they don't know any better so they don't ever think of anything else it's 

211.51 212.47 B: yeah 

212.39 213.10 A: (( argh )) 

213.48 214.86 B: yeah how um

236.20 237.05 A: [laughter] 

237.35 240.69 B: well we're we're thirty five miles outside of d._c. 

240.84 244.06 A: oh so you're in washington too but the other washington 

243.32 246.51 B: ye- yeah the district [laughter] 

245.11 247.28 A: [laughter] well that's kinda neat 

247.11 248.27 B: and um 

247.41 250.09 A: to be able to talk to somebody that far away 

249.56 250.60 B: yeah 

250.54 251.35 A: um 

251.36 254.58 B: and and it's amazing here i i wish 

254.76 259.33 B: i wish that the c._n._n. and the the media would show 

259.57 260.55 B: um 

260.77 264.86 B: like right outside all the roads that go to that lead to the pentagon 

264.64 265.58 A: mhm 

265.18 269.75 B: there is not a t- truck that goes by that isn't pulled over and searched 

269.54 271.37 A: well that's reassuring 

271.11 273.68 B: because they they can't get anywhere near it 

274.06 276.47 B: i haven't been down the pennsylvania avenue 

276.49 279.97 B: so i don't know what it's like at the white house um 

281.00 284.38 A: i'm sure they're on just very much alert alert 

284.06 287.61 B: yeah yeah and and they have to be 

287.73 293.24 B: you know my husband's stationed there now and i and i have to say you know him going into work is a [sigh] 

293.66 294.81 B: is a 

295.35 298.25 B: is a little disturbing some some days 

295.37 296.85 A: kind of scary thing 

297.94 298.97 A: yeah 

298.56 302.52 B: you know especially when you hear what's going on in the news 

302.38 309.49 A: i don't think there's really any place that that can be considered safe because we have like the navy and the shipyards here 

309.48 310.37 B: right 

309.97 311.08 A: and um 

312.18 315.73 A: it could it could just happen anywhere i don't think anybody 

316.20 318.82 A: you know or maybe wyoming there're nothing in wyoming 

318.12 322.33 B: [laughter] kansas cornfield but other than that 

321.04 321.78 A: [laughter] 

322.78 327.03 A: oh i shouldn't say that they used to say wyoming the state that god forgot 

326.99 332.02 B: [laughter] or idaho because i don't i really don't think anybody lives there any more 

331.73 337.59 A: but oh well there's it there's some but there's not much to do over there i don't think 

337.28 340.39 B: no well they could they grow very nice potatoes 

337.91 338.95 A: (( yeah [laughter] they're )) 

342.01 346.40 A: probably more expensive there than if you buy them in the store though that's usually how it goes 

345.58 347.06 B: exactly 

346.52 347.69 A: but um 

348.29 349.56 A: you know i 

350.39 352.15 A: i remember how 

352.78 354.68 A: when this first terrorism 

354.75 358.52 A: situation started how many months ago 

358.66 366.00 A: that they had it on the news all the time and now it's just kinda taken a back seat and i really think they need to ah 

360.93 361.97 B: yes 

366.03 369.43 A: just promote it more to keep people aware of it 

367.29 368.16 B: i 

368.80 375.80 B: i agree i really do and i was just saying that um to someone the other day thinking have we have we forgotten 

375.73 384.23 B: like people people have wanted to move on and forget and what have you but then again in the same instance it's be- we're becoming complacent again 

384.18 385.17 A: mhm 

384.27 387.83 B: we're at the point now where we're starting to get annoyed 

387.96 391.46 B: again at the um security in the airports 

391.78 392.78 A: yeah 

392.50 398.71 B: and you know this is bothersome and this is an inconvenience and and they seem to have forgotten that you know hey 

398.76 400.86 B: over three thousand people died 

401.17 402.55 A: oh i know 

401.86 408.22 B: because they're complacent and they weren't paying attention and you know we were surprised 

408.52 412.26 B: and you know do you really wanna be one of the three thousand that go again 

412.60 421.57 A: no i was in fact on my way to work today i was thinking about those people in that airplane how brave they were i mean would i have had that kind of courage to 

418.26 419.22 B: yeah 

422.25 427.58 A: man that was something that's amazing that that they would even do that for their country you know 

427.68 428.86 B: oh i know 

427.74 430.40 A: americans are pretty pro- proud people 

430.83 433.65 B: yeah and and i mean just [laughter] 

433.80 437.69 B: just to think that they have that that these men that are 

438.43 441.62 B: you know leading these people have got such charisma 

441.76 446.95 B: that they can get young men with their full lives ahead of them 

447.24 448.71 B: to kill themselves 

448.87 450.23 A: i know that's 

450.93 452.26 A: that's terrible 

451.96 454.13 B: and and not in a good way 

454.29 460.77 B: i mean you know it's one thing to pop cyanide and you know out you go you fall asleep and that's it it's another thing to ram 

460.86 465.91 B: you know an airplane into a building knowing how you're going to die and take all of those people with you 

466.13 470.92 A: i know and and they have no qualms about it they just this is my mission like 

470.50 472.16 B: yes and this is 

471.26 472.51 A: incredible 

472.18 474.27 B: this is going to get me to god 

475.23 478.07 A: there's some real screwed up people out there [laughter] 

478.06 481.20 B: you know i i don't i don't understand it mm 

481.48 483.15 B: i'm glad i don't 

483.54 488.32 A: yeah if i had that mind set i you- you're in the same situation they are 

488.12 489.85 B: exactly so i 

490.37 492.47 B: i think we need to to um 

492.69 501.44 A: i guess though when you think of it this way to them this is like hell on earth so if they die they actually go to heaven and they don't have to put up with this earth 

501.78 503.61 A: this life any more 

503.72 504.86 B: yeah 

504.48 507.71 A: and that's the only way i think i don't know 

508.24 511.25 A: it's pretty pretty messed up 

510.34 512.40 B: yeah it is 

512.45 513.29 A: (( terribly )) 

512.56 516.31 B: and in the mean in the meantime you've got an entire country 

516.50 518.03 B: you know on their knees 

518.67 520.96 A: oh i know i'm i'm very 

521.04 524.40 A: impressed with the president and his beliefs 

524.64 525.78 B: you know um 

525.98 529.38 B: he's he's taken a lotta slack because of this 

529.42 538.29 B: and um but i have to say you know i'm glad he's in office and you know a friend of mine is so against him and said well he's nothing but a but a cowboy 

538.57 541.26 B: well that's true and thank god he is 

541.52 544.05 B: because if there was anyone else in office 

544.53 547.29 B: you know i hate so say it if clinton was in office 

547.17 562.06 B: again you know our military would have been cut down to nothing sent to four cor- corners of the world for peace keeping missions god knows if you even try any kinda training during peace keeping missions they have the right to consider that a a threat 

561.95 563.46 B: a hostile threat 

562.24 563.46 A: oh yeah 

563.62 566.37 B: so you know when bush came into office 

566.60 568.63 B: our military was cut in half 

569.03 579.90 B: they had not been been combat trained because we were on peace keeping missions all over the world these men had not been home in i couldn't tell you how long because the rotation had already been messed up a- 

579.91 584.65 B: and yet here's somebody that goes you know i appreciate you you know we've 

585.50 590.27 B: we've gotten raises which has been much needed especially for the enlisted people 

590.18 591.73 A: oh that's good 

591.64 599.90 B: you know and and somebody actually cares about us and how we live our life and and thank goodness this is all starting to happen
