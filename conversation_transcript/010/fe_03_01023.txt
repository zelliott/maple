375.63 377.26 A: you know er 

377.57 378.61 A: so 

379.06 389.13 A: u- so they united states want to ah go into the war no matter what the resolution er the united nation have 

388.74 390.05 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

389.81 392.19 A: and i think it is very dangerous 

392.83 398.85 B: [noise] [noise] no [laughter] yeah i i think that bush is gonna he's gonna go to war regardless of what um 

398.77 399.89 A: right 

399.15 409.61 B: [noise] see my concern is going against the united nations you know i don't know if you actually well i don't know if you can actually do that but it seems like he's he's he's um bent on doing that 

402.25 403.95 A: mhm yeah 

406.53 407.48 A: yeah 

407.69 408.70 A: (( yeah if if )) 

408.87 411.98 A: if ah bush make a decision 

412.48 418.87 A: about going iraq no matter what the resolution is i think it would be very 

414.40 415.31 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

418.87 431.90 A: dangerous for the world peace maybe the united states is very strong you know so ah no country can win the united states actually but later 

424.74 425.90 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

431.92 434.62 A: later for example ah some 

434.99 440.18 A: ah let's see japan attacked somewhere asian countries 

436.99 437.98 B: (( [noise] right )) 

440.40 447.24 A: and and that's against the ah united nations ah intention 

447.29 448.52 B: right [noise] [noise] 

447.79 450.91 A: (( but for example ah japan )) 

451.03 455.31 A: could say that united states did the same thing 

455.32 458.36 A: and they they were not punished at all 

458.50 461.28 A: and why you know 

461.36 473.41 A: only japan needs to be punished you know so i think it's very important to ah keep the balance and then hear the ah voice from different nations 

464.81 465.57 B: (( right oh )) 

468.57 469.76 B: keep the balance 

473.28 474.14 B: right 

473.78 478.73 A: and then i think it's very important to follow the ah the united nations 

478.14 490.25 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i think i that's um i think it's important to do that too [noise] it's just more of a protection thing you don't want to go out and start wars on your own and not have other countries backing you up yeah i totally i totally agree 

481.25 482.54 A: mhm 

485.88 487.06 A: right 

487.83 489.10 A: yeah 

490.02 491.13 A: yeah
