15.46 19.89 A: yeah and as far as me i wouldn't do it for anyone 

20.47 21.22 B: yeah 

20.68 21.41 A: i don't (( care )) 

21.59 30.47 A: i don't care if it was a family member or a close friends uh number one i don't like lying and number two i don't want to go to jail so 

27.61 28.03 B: right 

28.92 29.72 B: right 

29.87 34.08 B: yeah i think i would have the same problem i don't know though it would be really hard if 

34.69 45.65 B: if my loved one was going to be going to prison for several years i reckon eh i don't know it's pretty hard to to say unless eh you're actually in that situation i guess it would be 

46.11 50.44 B: yeah mostly i'm completely scared to death of lying and getting in trouble 

50.13 53.20 A: right because they usually can find out so 

52.66 54.18 B: right yeah 

53.77 58.29 A: you know even if it were my significant other i don't think i'd do it for them either 

58.30 58.89 B: yeah 

59.48 63.93 A: because i eh and when it comes down to it both of you might end up in jail and 

63.72 65.28 B: right yeah that's a good 

64.55 65.76 A: i wouldn't want that 

65.92 67.41 B: no way no way

75.78 76.15 B: (( )) 

78.63 79.42 B: oh wow (( )) 

79.13 82.14 A: and um and we've got a few people 

82.26 88.06 A: you know that were up there on the stand that were lying so and the judges definitely don't like that 

84.71 85.36 B: (( well )) 

87.99 89.53 B: right i could imagine (( )) 

89.59 92.34 A: they definitely y- because that can mess up a whole tape 

92.53 92.99 B: mhm 

93.25 95.55 A: so um they don't like it so 

95.66 99.76 A: no i seen what the system can do so it's not for me 

98.73 99.07 B: yeah 

100.00 100.47 B: hm 

100.89 103.26 B: then it's probably not for me either 

102.97 103.45 A: (( )) 

103.35 105.20 B: yeah i i've never been in a 

105.35 107.05 B: you know never ever had to even 

107.25 108.53 B: think about it before so 

108.86 111.70 B: um yeah i guess i probably wouldn't simply because i'm 

111.85 113.66 B: too scared of the system 

113.98 118.88 A: well a actually i've been asked to purger myself and i'm like i don't think so 

119.02 119.69 B: wow 

119.45 128.88 A: no no you know to help out a friend it's like nope wasn't there you know no i can't you know i love you and all but i'm not going out on a limb like that 

121.75 122.17 B: yeah 

128.72 129.37 B: yeah that's 

129.52 130.14 B: dangerous 

129.84 130.32 A: so 

131.73 132.30 A: (( and uh )) 

132.50 140.09 A: i'm a firm believer and you got to you got to live up to whatever it is that you do and you have to suffer the consequences so 

137.37 137.96 B: yeah 

139.92 140.75 B: yeah 

140.34 145.62 A: why should i suffer for a mistake that you made right you know because 

142.93 144.60 B: oh definitely huh 

144.88 145.54 B: (( )) 

146.66 146.94 B: hm 

147.04 148.44 A: (( )) it's not for me 

148.51 158.02 B: no not for me either then i mean yeah i sound like i'm just agreeing with you but yeah i hadn't ever thought about it before so but that yeah i definitely 

158.67 159.50 B: think that it would 

160.06 164.05 B: not be in my best interesting to purger myself yeah 

163.59 169.35 A: right and then when you think about it you think about the big picture you're perjuring yourself therefore you've got a record 

169.51 170.06 B: mhm 

170.41 178.11 A: um a lot of places you know depending on the type of work that you're in you won't be allowed to you know because you do have a record now 

177.62 178.28 B: oh wow 

178.22 182.40 A: you know they might not hire you so i mean people have to look at the big picture 

182.35 183.02 B: right 

183.12 188.33 A: not just you know well you're just going to go up there and you're going to lie for me just this one time but 

188.46 190.45 A: how is that going to affect your life 

190.32 191.11 B: yeah 

198.13 198.72 B: yeah 

199.11 202.72 A: how is that one mistake that you're making going to affect the rest of your life (( so )) 

203.53 204.19 B: (( ah )) 

203.81 207.99 A: i'm not willing to suffer the consequences of it so 

204.94 206.42 B: no (( )) 

207.97 208.54 B: (( i )) 

209.42 209.90 B: huh 

211.02 211.62 B: interesting 

211.76 212.62 B: hm 

212.05 214.67 A: and this is a long time 

213.71 222.88 B: it's a very long time yeah i don't even have a clue how long we've already started doesn't feel like very lon- i mean yeah probably we're probably only what two or three minutes into it 

222.28 225.62 A: um about five minutes into it 

224.36 229.30 B: oh okay well that's a lot better than what i thought but goodness yeah i wonder if 

232.46 236.38 A: so what else do we ha- th- we have to keep talking about perjuring ourselves huh 

232.56 233.11 B: (( yeah )) 

236.19 237.15 B: yeah 

236.62 237.96 A: or whether or not we would do it 

238.08 243.48 B: yeah (( says )) for up to eight minutes so for two minutes we can talk about whatever 

245.31 251.94 A: no that would be introductory of ourselves and you know those things let me see what else 

247.11 248.63 B: oh 

249.69 250.61 B: yeah 

252.34 253.65 B: um 

254.42 258.36 B: along the lines of the whole um jury thing i've never actually had jury duty yet 

259.10 259.51 B: um 

259.47 260.80 A: oh you're lucky 

259.81 260.45 B: i got enough 

261.03 265.02 B: oh i'm twenty seven i don't know if that's lucky or just youth 

264.36 265.21 A: i have the 

265.42 266.96 A: i get called every year 

266.90 267.56 B: really 

267.63 268.78 A: yes 

268.56 269.54 B: oh my goodness 

269.64 272.81 A: every year and i've been on a few trials 

272.86 273.71 B: wow 

274.00 274.49 B: huh 

274.09 283.65 A: yeah so you know i've been pretty um you know some homicides and so yeah i've had the luxury i guess if that's what you want to call it of serving our 

278.37 279.37 B: oh my goodness 

283.96 288.27 A: justice system and seeing it at work and it's a pretty fascinating 

288.36 289.00 B: really 

288.80 296.08 A: um system yeah it is it it's pretty fascinating i you know you can wri- i can see how people write a book about 

291.13 291.64 B: huh 

296.58 300.06 A: you know actually going to court and being jurors 

300.19 300.72 B: huh 

300.88 301.41 B: (( what )) 

306.27 306.76 B: uh-huh 

306.89 312.18 A: you know and the way you know and people were on the stand and saying whatever it was that they were saying 

311.78 312.61 B: right 

312.98 317.46 A: so yeah it it's a pretty fascinating um experience so 

313.50 314.12 B: huh 

323.94 324.40 B: (( um um )) 

326.60 329.57 A: thinking that a person had lied and no 

329.81 331.22 B: huh 

330.98 337.38 A: th- uh being on the end of it and there's no way because if you've got one person that thinks that you're lying 

337.35 338.01 B: yeah 

337.76 339.58 A: you know that that could be it 

339.60 340.40 B: huh right 

340.81 341.35 A: (( yeah i know )) 

341.73 343.27 A: jail is not a place for me 

343.84 350.98 B: no (( oh gosh )) i don't think i could ever exist there no i like my freedom a bit much 

350.70 355.97 A: right i like getting up and going when i feel like going and eating my meals when i want to so it's just 

356.58 358.32 A: you know the consequences 

358.50 361.38 A: perhaps if there weren't any consequences behind 

361.33 361.88 B: right 

361.63 365.35 A: the perjury then you know i might give it a thought 

365.36 365.94 B: right 

365.73 370.34 A: no and the fact and i'm one of those people if i do something wrong i always get caught so 

369.72 372.83 B: ah god yep me too oh my goodness 

370.48 379.24 A: so all the more reason for me to keep tabs on myself and you know to keep myself on the straight and narrow 

375.82 376.73 B: yeah 

379.85 380.62 B: (( that's cool )) 

381.12 382.42 B: yeah me too i i uh 

383.61 384.90 B: yeah i i've been 

385.13 386.91 B: married to a person who um 

387.21 389.29 B: finds it uh much easier to 

389.48 399.24 B: uh stretch the truth than i do and i always get caught every time i try e- (( )) emulate him (( )) oh okay i can't do this so the truth is 

391.77 392.33 A: um 

399.59 403.23 B: too much work keeping it all going 

400.20 400.70 A: mhm 

402.21 402.78 A: right 

403.06 403.57 A: and then 

404.11 408.37 A: the thing about perjury and lying is once you start you have to remember 
408.27 409.72 B: yeah 

412.01 412.30 B: uh 

412.83 415.72 B: yeah 

415.08 418.00 A: then i said and you know if they interview you again 

416.41 417.60 B: right 

418.18 421.95 A: then you have to remember everything you said the first interview and hope that you don't contradict 

422.03 422.81 B: right 

422.36 423.22 A: what you said 

423.24 424.52 B: (( )) surely 

424.17 427.57 A: my brain doesn- i don't have a photogenic memory like that so 

426.84 427.72 B: uh 

428.08 428.71 A: hm um 

428.55 429.21 B: me either 

436.69 437.88 A: right right 

437.17 441.28 B: which one was it it never works out 

438.68 439.32 A: right 

442.54 442.81 A: um 

442.96 445.16 A: you know there are of course there are some things that are 

445.64 448.88 A: a lot easier to remember than other things but i don't 

449.12 450.33 A: something like that um 

450.34 451.74 B: yeah (( oh yeah )) 

451.37 453.64 A: i don't think it'd be at the forefront of my brain 

453.57 454.93 B: nope 

455.08 457.04 B: yeah certainly doesn't 

456.33 457.79 A: oh i'd be in trouble 

459.14 460.06 A: big time 

460.71 462.39 B: yeah i think i would too i'm just 

463.31 471.63 B: matter of fact i get accused of being too honest by my husband so as if that's a possibility i don't know that it is 

466.69 467.11 A: hm 

471.74 475.34 A: um yeah i don't know that it is either you know but 

476.11 479.37 A: like i believe in living right trying to live right at least so 

478.60 478.85 B: hm 

479.05 480.03 B: (( totally )) 

480.29 484.13 A: yeah you have to be truthful even if you know it's going to get you in trouble 

484.05 484.42 B: yeah 

484.41 485.03 A: you know 

485.55 490.86 A: but that's what makes uh character in a person you know that's what makes character is you can stand up for 

491.12 491.78 A: right 

492.07 494.54 A: even if no one else is so 

493.57 494.12 B: right 

495.62 497.36 A: and it's how i try to live 

498.02 498.39 B: yeah
