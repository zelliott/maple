0.00 1.34 B: i'm serena 

0.92 2.29 A: hey i'm greg 

2.37 5.89 B: hi greg so what do you think about perjury would you do it 

4.86 5.65 A: (( perjury )) 

5.85 12.06 A: wow there's a chance that i could do perjury for a close friend but you know we don't 

11.31 14.34 B: you have a hypothetical situation in mind or 

15.00 16.06 A: (( mm )) 

16.19 17.63 A: do i ha- no i don't 

17.49 18.41 B: okay 

18.45 19.73 A: where are you by the way 

19.97 21.53 B: i'm in ah new york 

21.28 24.13 A: okay i'm in chapel hill north carolina 

23.65 24.56 B: okay 

24.83 27.78 A: this is my f- this is the first one of these i'm doing 

27.26 29.57 B: i've done it a- several times before 

29.02 29.84 A: okay 

29.79 30.72 B: um 

31.17 45.08 B: i just don't know i don't think i would i don't think for the little things that it's that important so why do it and then for the big stuff i think i would say well if it's big then the truth is important 

45.48 49.80 B: but then again you know i'd never really thought very much about it so 

50.26 51.85 A: but what if it was a 

52.37 63.75 A: a perjury issue but there were extenuating circumstances but as as far as the law is concerned it's black or white but in reality the wrong thing is going to be done and it's especially going to be done to the wrong person 

56.33 57.44 B: yeah 

63.37 64.33 B: right 

64.54 73.61 B: then you know what i might have to think about it more but then again i mean like i said i'd never even really thought of a situation so it's hard to say 

73.74 77.62 B: i mean i've seen things on t._v. where people have to make those kinds of decisions 

76.97 78.23 A: right 

77.79 81.01 B: and i sort of just watch and go hm tough one 

81.25 92.78 A: yeah and i think there's probably a lot of movies and t._v. shows that that's exactly that's exactly the topic that's a it's a tough decision and there's a lot of players have to make make tough decisions somehow 

92.44 93.53 B: mhm 

92.92 93.95 A: um 

94.18 105.14 A: well i d- i think for most of us we probably it probably feels black and white i mean you want to do the right thing you want to follow the law but that doesn't that isn't always logical 

101.72 102.93 B: mhm 

104.50 105.40 B: right 

105.12 111.78 A: um boy i'm just trying to think i mean there must be some movie that comes to my mind that that's exactly the topic you know 

111.44 112.47 B: mhm 

112.32 114.56 A: like ah what was the one where 

114.95 116.10 A: um 

116.52 118.95 A: ah they the guys let's see 

118.99 123.03 A: no that's not a good example plus i don't even feel so that wouldn't work out 

124.33 127.88 A: i don't know i've not been in a situation situation quite like that 

126.58 136.82 B: yeah it's hard to say like like i said before i mean if it was something small i'd say why risk being punished and why bother with having that on my conscience if it's something small 

136.44 137.55 A: yep 

136.97 141.91 B: and if it's something big then maybe the truth is important if it's something big but 

142.70 143.75 B: [sigh] i don't know 

143.71 145.67 A: true i'm i'm with you all the way 

146.09 153.73 A: all right so what what are the purpose of this whole study do do you know like is it just for the voice recognition of the system is that what you 

149.78 150.60 B: i 

152.95 160.42 B: i don't know if it's for the system or if it is for um to actually record um people having conversations 

160.65 164.49 B: um but i know it has something to do with linguistics that's all i know 

164.10 165.54 A: i gotcha okay all 

166.25 167.65 A: right so 

167.66 175.86 A: gosh we don't have a real g- i'm just trying to think of how we can continue the conversation on this topic if we don't have a specific sample and we haven't really thought about it 

171.07 172.10 B: i know 

176.32 177.21 A: so 

176.43 185.82 B: well i'm trying to think have you ever heard of that book uh like the question book the book of questions where they give you several moral situations and you have to work your way through them 

185.96 187.60 A: yeah i've heard of it 

187.05 192.49 B: and i think that i encountered questions similar to this you know what if 

192.83 200.44 B: the you know the wrong person was being accused of something and you know that you knew the truth but the only way to you know 

200.62 202.83 B: get the truth out was to lie 

202.95 204.24 B: that kind of thing 

203.84 205.07 A: right 

205.30 208.02 B: and so you know the whole would you do it 

208.67 209.74 B: and uh 

210.05 218.57 B: i think that uh at that time you know i was in middle school when we were asking those kinds of questions and i think as a child everything seems so black and white 

214.78 216.03 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

218.27 219.46 A: right 

218.97 221.96 B: and of course i always said oh no never [laughter] 

220.83 222.48 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

222.06 226.96 B: the truth will always prevail anyway in the end you know the right people will win 

224.59 225.60 A: right 

227.87 228.80 B: but 

229.08 230.90 A: but now we know better 

230.31 231.37 B: (( yeah )) 

232.40 235.23 A: hm i i guess you know overall that's 

235.47 246.87 A: [mn] no matter how you want it to be black and white it's going to be it depends and you're really not going to know it till it till it comes and bites you in the face before you have to decide because if it's if it's a matter of um 

243.76 245.16 B: mhm 

246.87 261.48 A: you know something that would send your send a friend or your mother to jail because because of something that happened that was probably out of their control you know most of the people you know are very very good but sometimes you have to protect 

256.25 257.23 B: right 

259.24 260.13 B: mhm 

261.29 263.47 A: you know protect people on 

263.58 264.62 A: um 

264.86 266.32 A: on a different level 

266.42 271.36 A: you're going to defend them to you know whatever it takes and you put yourself in jeopardy 

269.35 270.51 B: right 

270.80 278.06 B: well i can think of a situation where you know i did the wrong thing trying to defend somebody ah i know my sister was in the hospital and 

278.29 282.30 B: i really didn't think there was anything wrong with her and they wanted to keep her 

281.84 282.94 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

282.31 288.04 B: and i argued against keeping her there and she got to go home and then ended up going back the next day 

288.08 294.39 B: and i sincerely thought that the motivation of the doctor who was trying to keep her were 

294.88 298.31 B: you know false and he just didn't know her 

298.48 300.19 B: you know and i kept saying well look 

300.35 310.88 B: she's never spent the night alone in her life she's eighteen this'll be a horrible thing if you made her spend the night alone without her family and the doctor's sitting there thinking obviously there's something wrong with this family then 

306.30 307.51 A: mhm 

310.60 312.09 A: (( right )) 

311.09 315.25 B: and i'm sitting there thinking how could you do this to her that's a horrible thing to do 

315.31 322.57 B: so i mean i know how i react when it comes to defending family whether for better or for worse 

323.31 324.20 B: but ah 

324.65 332.60 A: [noise] then if a similar thing came came up you may make similar decisions right [laughter] if you think it's right 

329.58 332.20 B: exactly exactly as much as 

332.25 342.36 B: yeah i mean i'm i now i know but you know and i i'm sure the doctor was thinking man this is how it always is we're trying to work with families families always try and get in the way 

341.95 343.06 A: right 

342.43 346.58 B: and i'm sitting here thinking oh wow he actually did know what he was talking about [laughter] 

345.92 349.20 A: yeah [laughter] shocking thing 

348.32 349.55 B: yep 

350.62 351.77 B: all right then 

350.64 353.67 A: all right well did we make ten minutes i i r- 

353.22 356.12 B: i haven't been watching but it sure feels like it 

355.60 364.01 A: it does it does i'm not sure we're ten i'm let me see i i think we're like at seven actually so what what other what other kind of subjects have you 

360.09 362.06 B: okay okay keep 

364.20 365.65 A: had calls on 

365.06 369.41 B: um i had a call on i'm trying to think 

369.72 374.67 B: ah what did i think about the school system if it's going from bad to worse 

374.23 375.04 A: uh-huh 

374.71 376.24 B: in the country 

376.27 377.52 B: (( and ah )) 

377.62 383.73 B: i think not i think that's it's being going from bad to worse ever since school systems were ever invented 

383.07 386.03 A: you think it's rock bottom already [laughter] 

384.72 394.80 B: well i i mean i think that that's always a concern in every society at every time period they all people always think that everything's bad in the school system 

393.35 395.42 A: right and the world's always coming to an end yeah 

394.83 395.82 B: right 

395.85 396.70 B: so 

396.89 403.43 B: on that i mean whether or not it is bad is another thing but i think that the concern is always there 

402.81 403.67 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

404.38 405.49 B: (( and ah )) 

405.90 407.80 B: i can't remember other ones 

408.70 413.12 B: this was the one that i think i felt the least prepared to discuss 

413.49 416.54 B: just because i haven't really talked about it a lot 

415.75 421.44 A: right yeah i didn't know if this was going to be i didn't know how many people participate in the and it sounds like it's going to be two everytime [noise] 

421.03 432.43 B: um it's two everytime um oftentimes i have a hard time i'm on hold for a long time while they look for someone but in the last few weeks there have always been there always has been someone there so 

432.06 432.86 A: uh-huh 

432.46 434.88 B: i think more people are starting to 

435.16 436.49 B: participate [noise] 

436.72 442.59 A: yeah i just got i just got laid off my job and was surfing around found this and said well why not [laughter] 

441.95 450.68 B: yeah well i study linguistics so i heard through the grapevine that there was a an experiment going on but obviously i can't know what it's about otherwise it would 

450.91 452.77 B: you know not be right 

452.13 454.02 A: yeah and be decue you 

453.96 458.11 B: so i i don't know what it is i just know it has something to do with linguistics so 

458.22 462.12 B: having done many projects before where you had to search out people 

462.44 471.06 B: i was like oh well i'll i'll do that definitely because i know what it's like to try and look for people to volunteer for things yep [laughter] 

468.38 470.00 A: help help out their brothers huh 

470.31 472.56 A: i i i heard of um 

472.65 478.15 A: a lot of companies are now sending their computer support and things like that to india 

477.99 479.04 B: mhm 

478.46 482.81 A: and the one one new opportunity that's opening up is for 

482.78 495.13 A: americans to go there and just talk with them and talk about this is the way somebody might state this issue and this is the way you need to address it and basically the linguistic but also the ah the cultural 

488.93 490.87 B: [noise] 

495.12 497.19 B: right right 

495.46 500.90 A: details so i don't know they're kind of interesting things so maybe they're going to send our conversation to india [laughter] 

500.43 504.67 B: that i- that is actually very interesting i've studied similar things um 

504.77 511.22 B: where the the level of language at which we make our sort of habitual lines of speech 

511.27 522.41 B: ah vary from culture to culture and how you can cause communication problems trying to use what you think are the habitual you know formulaic expressions that someone else doesn't understand 

522.01 523.30 A: mhm 

522.76 530.64 B: whether it be intonation patterns or you know it could be at a another level but used to e- express sort of cultural 

531.14 532.98 B: information so 

532.09 532.88 A: right 

533.19 535.45 B: that's a very interesting topic 

535.70 539.55 B: yeah the the big thing in linguistics right now is obviously um 

539.68 543.23 B: phonetics and phonology and the whole computer 

543.66 546.39 B: stuff computational linguistics 

544.26 545.28 A: (( right so )) 

546.95 548.07 B: that's a big one 

548.51 550.42 B: and that's where the money is really 

550.30 554.32 A: are you still studying or are you out and making some of that money 

553.72 556.96 B: um i'm i'm writing my thesis right now 

556.55 558.65 A: okay so you're making no money 

558.07 559.74 B: making no money no 

558.71 560.46 A: [laughter] 

560.50 564.56 A: all right well i think we have made our ten minutes now
