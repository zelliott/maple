14.93 16.52 B: i haven't either 

16.53 17.58 A: um 

17.84 20.50 A: i guess that was the question he said 

20.13 21.17 B: yeah 

20.54 24.16 A: would you commit perjury for a close friend 

25.03 33.47 A: i don't know i'm quite you know i would think not but i think maybe if the situation came up and it was a close friend and it wasn't 

33.48 35.77 A: like a very serious thing 

35.48 36.52 B: mhm 

37.69 38.82 A: i don't know 

38.80 40.92 B: i definitely would not 

42.01 47.96 B: i've um i don't think even if it was a small situation or a small um 

49.16 52.71 B: you know if it was even if it wasn't that serious i don't think i would 

57.28 58.77 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

59.42 62.95 B: do you have any feedback do you have any other feedback 

59.52 60.23 A: sorry 

60.71 61.63 A: what 

62.89 64.09 A: um 

65.11 69.52 A: what if it was a like a very small situation very like 

72.35 78.45 A: nothing that would really but not like murder or anything but something that wouldn't really affect 

79.70 83.70 B: well when you think of the word perjury that kind of sounds serious right 

83.07 91.58 A: right [laughter] exactly you know um i don't think i would put myself into um into a situation where [noise] 

84.05 85.98 B: (( [laughter] so )) 

93.10 94.13 A: well 

94.15 96.72 A: i guess i wouldn't because there's always 

96.92 102.89 A: that chance you know i mean you watch all these court shows on t._v. and you see them and 

103.26 106.44 A: n- even if it's small it um 

108.04 111.33 A: it there are serious consequences 

110.36 111.39 B: right 

111.69 112.87 A: so 

114.32 116.28 A: i guess even um 

116.30 117.57 A: to 

119.94 127.37 A: get help you know to help somebody out if you were to help somebody out there's al- there's a chance that you would wind up in jail 

127.18 128.30 B: right 

128.00 131.99 A: um i- and you know i guess it wouldn't really be worth it no matter what 

133.36 136.58 B: i i definitely wouldn't and i don't know [laughter] 

137.93 140.87 B: they need someone on here asking more questions don't they 

140.46 141.96 A: i know [laughter] they 

141.95 143.07 B: [laughter] 

142.46 148.73 A: need to give you more like more this was a sit- you know more of a specific situation i think 

144.44 145.43 B: more 

145.70 146.57 B: right 

148.11 149.02 B: mhm 

149.15 153.60 B: but using that word perjury there it's a definite no um 

153.95 157.86 B: i guess you know i wish they had more circumstances or something 

157.80 163.91 A: i know well they say like close friend but think about it what if it was a- like your spouse or your child 

163.70 165.57 B: [mn] no i wouldn't 

166.41 169.64 B: i guess because i was brought up that way you know 

168.41 170.05 A: mhm 

170.51 173.33 B: to not lie or um 

171.26 172.41 A: [noise] 

173.34 177.55 B: deceive or you know any of that that's just how i was brought up 

177.25 178.08 A: right 

177.63 180.67 B: and i'm f- also afraid of the consequences 

180.97 183.73 B: i've always been like that even going through school 

182.36 182.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

183.45 184.47 A: mhm 

183.79 194.68 B: i'm twenty five now but um when i was in high school hanging out with friends i was always scared of the consequences regardless of if it was something small or you know something serious 

194.08 195.08 A: right 

194.75 197.05 B: i i just didn't want to 

197.55 199.13 B: face um 

199.89 202.77 B: what would happen if i was to do something like that 

203.62 213.87 B: but you know if some if a friend of mine did commit perjury which a few of our friends did in high school i i wouldn't tell on 'em or anything but i just stayed out of it 

211.92 214.92 A: right like actual perjury in a court 

214.52 218.61 B: yeah well as far as lying or and stealing or something 

216.96 217.97 A: mhm 

218.70 222.67 B: i had a lot of friends in high school that got into that sort of brief 

222.87 229.41 B: you know just for a a while until they got caught i know they were stealing from stores and stuff at the mall 

226.23 227.12 A: (( [noise] )) 

229.34 238.46 B: and these people you wouldn't even imagine doing that you know but when they got caught they didn't do it anymore but i'd always stay out of that i never got into it 

237.71 238.85 A: mhm 

238.72 239.55 B: (( so )) 

239.31 242.11 A: me neither and i don't i didn't really have any 

242.31 251.13 A: any friends that did i mean the worst thing that ever happened in high school was that a bunch of a bunch of my friends had gotten um trespassing tickets 

243.73 244.52 B: mhm 

251.07 252.08 B: (( oh really )) 

251.46 260.57 A: for like hanging out somewhere you know at like the local like park after dark when there you know when there's a sign that says closed at you know closed after dark [laughter] 

254.60 255.60 B: mhm 

258.93 259.94 B: yeah 

260.79 268.82 B: well it was strange because these people were um you know in honor society and in athletics and you just wouldn't have imagined that from them 

265.46 266.49 A: mhm 

268.74 275.81 A: well you know i've seen like a lot of people do it just for the thrill of actually doing it rather than they really need what they got what they take 

272.86 274.04 B: right 

275.20 276.35 B: mhm 

276.63 281.46 B: i don't think so i mean they stole from a close friend of ours too that was kind of wealthy 

281.71 284.27 B: i don't know people do it for different reasons you know 

285.25 292.31 A: it's hard to it's hard to imagine when you know when you're so like i would never you know you would never even think about it 

292.57 298.23 A: um it's har- it's hard to imagine why you know what somebody's reasons for doing it would be 

298.07 299.15 B: right 

299.26 302.66 B: and i think a lot of times it is for just the thrill of it 

302.02 303.49 A: mhm 

302.68 303.74 B: (( you know )) 

304.28 308.48 A: but i watch like um i watch the practice did you ever watch that show 

308.06 311.23 B: no mm-mm but i watch a lot of court t._v. 

309.32 310.15 A: i w- 

310.79 317.75 A: yeah i mean you see you know the practice has like a lot of very derived um 

317.90 318.99 A: cases 

318.82 319.85 B: mhm 

319.47 325.60 A: but they all you know there's alwa- there's always a twist you know there's always like a bit twist to it um 

324.25 325.19 B: right 

325.59 334.92 A: and you see them they when they think somebody's lying like they really go after them like fully arrest them threaten them with jail um 

333.57 334.45 B: mhm 

335.48 339.02 A: you know i mean if they're convinced that what they're saying is is a lie 

338.83 339.87 B: right 

340.65 342.38 B: do you watch court t._v. a lot 

342.52 349.83 A: i watched like a bunch of the movies that were on court t._v. not so much like the actual live part but i do watch law and order 

345.43 346.65 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

350.34 355.32 B: yeah i don't watch that either [laughter] i like to watch more the um 

352.27 353.57 A: oh but 

355.67 361.15 B: you know stuff that's not fake like the actual cases on air i like to watch them 

357.65 358.88 A: mhm 

359.42 360.40 A: right 

361.57 365.92 A: do you watch any of like the actual court shows the judge shows 

364.08 365.33 B: mhm

438.84 441.32 A: do they tell do they tell you when the time's up

444.10 445.04 A: okay 

446.51 447.47 A: okay 

447.52 448.68 A: um 

448.32 451.00 B: so this is the first one you've done first call

454.56 457.13 A: and i got the message and i was like oh no 

457.43 461.69 B: well they called last night and i guess i could never get anyone on the other end 

461.74 463.02 A: oh really 

462.39 464.63 B: mhm they called about three times 

464.46 465.54 A: oh wow 

465.15 466.21 B: mhm 

466.61 474.17 A: you know i just saw it actually um i just signed up for it you know i didn't figure they'd call because she just called me today with the p._i._n. number 

473.72 474.85 B: mhm 

474.39 476.86 A: so i didn't think that they would call so 

476.90 477.64 A: (( soon )) 

477.66 483.06 B: i guess we could um think of different scenarios for perjury you know um 

481.40 482.26 A: (( okay )) 

482.59 484.03 A: mhm 

486.45 487.34 B: (( let's see )) 

488.57 489.96 B: can you think of any 

490.74 492.00 A: um 

494.13 502.05 A: well like i said before like are you married okay so what if your husband had 

496.72 497.85 B: (( yeah )) 

502.50 508.09 A: taken something from a store you know something like very simple like that and gotten caught 

508.38 509.57 A: um 

510.56 512.73 A: and the only way that he wouldn't 

514.31 517.61 A: you know face prison time is if you helped him out 

517.26 518.42 B: mhm 

518.12 520.30 A: you know would do you have children 

520.45 521.24 B: yes 

520.93 529.04 A: okay so it you know in that situation i mean i have a a new baby and i would think it would be hard to 

526.32 527.31 B: (( so do i )) 

529.59 535.22 A: you know to have a husband in in prison and not have the income and not have the house with the baby 

534.78 536.36 B: i see what you're saying 

538.37 542.73 B: well how how would you help him out you mean actually do that actually 

542.10 551.80 A: yeah i mean if the only way that you could that that he would avoid prison is if you you know if you would get up and say i mean i don't know what you could say but if you could say something that 

545.93 547.08 B: mhm 

547.99 548.94 B: you mean if 

550.28 552.72 B: you mean if you said you did it or something 

552.17 556.77 A: you knew that it wasn't the truth you know that he th- you know blame somebody else 

557.64 559.49 A: even though you knew it wasn't true 

559.55 560.63 B: um 

561.28 563.70 B: i don't know if if the um 

563.79 565.45 B: authorities were involved 

565.08 566.22 A: mhm 

565.62 567.99 B: i don't i don't know because 

568.12 569.20 B: i know don't know wh- 

569.02 570.71 A: (( see it's hard right )) 

569.72 573.89 B: i think i would be scared if the if the authorities were involved in it 

574.10 576.81 B: you know if it was maybe just the store 

576.54 577.65 A: mhm 

577.04 580.23 B: or the place of business that it happened 

579.61 580.85 A: right 

580.33 583.37 B: um maybe at first i would act like i didn't 

584.99 589.97 B: act like i didn't think it was him you know and kind of see how far i could get with that 

586.98 588.01 A: mhm 

589.38 590.29 A: right 

590.46 597.56 B: but um when once the police are involved i think i would probably be scared and give 'em the truth [laughter] you know 

596.27 597.46 A: [laughter] 

598.26 599.90 A: even if it meant that like
