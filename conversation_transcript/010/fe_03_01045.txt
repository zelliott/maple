60.59 61.47 B: i- it's funny 

62.04 63.46 A: but it's sometimes 

64.02 67.82 A: i guess i guess you do have to draw the line because i guess so much of humor now 

68.32 69.76 A: and people like it though then they're 

69.89 74.74 A: an- an- and they know people like it they'll go into other stuff and bring other things in you know what i'm saying 

74.99 75.40 B: yeah 

75.84 79.76 B: that's true like i what y- i know what you're saying like you draw the they it's it's 

80.35 83.81 B: it's someth- they think it's funny they'll take it one step further 

83.20 84.79 A: right right one step up 

84.07 87.97 B: and they go further and further and further until sometimes it's just unbelievable 

88.55 89.02 B: um 

93.43 94.20 A: yeah they stop being 

95.69 96.07 A: funny 

96.62 98.90 A: but really they trying to show another picture you know 

99.33 99.91 B: yeah 

100.70 102.10 B: so what do you not like 

103.28 105.31 A: eh ah well i guess uh 

106.30 107.41 A: uh i i don't 

107.54 113.01 A: uh let's see uh what show do i not like i don't kn- uh that's a good question as far as humor 

113.79 121.39 A: that's a good question that's why i i know i need to draw the line because i like anything humor i like to laugh though i know laughing's good like a merry medicine you know 

120.87 129.01 B: it it is it does do good like a medicine i i don't and i and i may be stepping on your toes here but a a lot of the um 

129.48 132.99 B: the comedies lately have a lot of gay people and they have a lot of 

133.40 134.98 B: you know like trying to push 

135.37 141.90 B: that you know homo sexuality is okay and i i just don't i don't think it's okay and i don't like it in my face 

142.25 144.59 B: this time and i guess i draw the line there too 

144.36 146.65 A: okay well yeah that one draw the line there 

147.23 157.24 A: that's good too because like i say sometimes people i've said before some people have to go out and start mixing stuff up though making us laugh and they thinking it's all right every thing's all right because of the humor that's in it you know 

164.74 171.62 B: people and i i do love people that are homosexuals but the fact that it it's on all the time 

172.30 177.18 B: and you do watch it and you do think well they're funny and they're a person just like me so you start 

177.41 185.77 B: wondering if you should change your values you know maybe should i think homo sexuality is okay and i don't wa- i mean you know i don't want the kids thinking it's okay 

182.91 183.77 A: right right right 

185.70 186.86 A: because even the humor that that's 

186.96 193.61 A: that comes on and people you know 

193.54 194.33 B: mhm 

209.44 210.03 B: mhm 

210.31 212.77 B: well hav- i (( like )) actually having 

222.22 222.67 B: they just 

222.79 226.50 B: said that and did he hear it did this four year old hear that i hope he didn't 

239.70 240.24 B: mhm 

240.02 251.65 A: people start getting curious you know and after th- the way it's seem on t._v. and show it like that people starting getting curious like e- everyone think it's all right everyone think its acceptable see i think once you ac- accept th- that kind of life then what happens though 

251.94 258.43 A: it uh that after awhile you you slowly gradually think you know then you and you and you have friends who surround you and it's okay and then 

258.70 264.30 B: you incorporate it into your lifestyle sometimes after awhile what you're what you allow to be 

258.73 259.24 A: and then 

260.38 261.49 A: and right right 

262.32 263.10 A: right right 

264.87 266.03 B: what you feed yourself 

266.63 267.48 B: you'll sort of 

267.86 270.90 B: incorporate into your life if you're not too if you're not careful 

285.47 294.93 B: you have to guar- you have to guard what you let in you do and i uh some again some shows you know it's funny and i think it's funny and i wish i didn't think it's 

295.03 303.01 B: funny but i i uh i i wish that they would leave the profanity out i i think that um most shows could be funny without 

303.41 309.79 B: you know without that but apparently these days the they don't think so because it keeps getting more and more 

310.60 316.20 B: the words that you hear coming out at eight o'clock or nine o'clock at night is something i never thought i would hear 

316.30 317.96 B: in my lifetime i'm kind of 

316.36 316.77 A: right 

318.08 326.64 B: i'm really surprised because i don't have cable and sometimes i'm sitting there watching and i'm thinking oh my goodness and i don't even have cable i can't believe they said that 

326.75 333.65 A: and some places though some places though th- lot of that stuff that (( stupid expressive )) stuff though come on late at night it don't have to be cable though you know 

333.98 337.63 B: yeah that's true but it's ge- it seems to be getting uh earlier 

337.90 340.36 B: in the evening that you're seeing that kind of thing 

340.83 341.73 B: now but 

342.08 342.60 B: i guess 

344.26 344.86 B: in some 

345.13 351.09 B: some shows that are wholesome and humorous are are kind of corny and i guess you know maybe that's been the problem 

351.54 355.34 B: but it it would be nice if they just put a little bit more effort in and 

355.46 360.49 B: and had some shows that that didn't have so much about sex or so much about 

360.84 361.45 B: i don't know 

361.65 362.68 B: even you know 

362.31 365.56 A: vanity or something like that yeah or homo sexuality or something like that 

363.55 371.75 B: yeah or yeah or or adultery or you know they j- they're making that stuff funny which makes us you know sort of accept it and think of it as acceptable behavior 

372.51 373.36 B: and i think um 

373.50 374.90 B: you know our cultures suffer 

374.99 375.32 B: for 

375.52 376.06 B: for that 

376.28 384.56 B: we we have loosened our values and the family kind of fell apart and you know it gets deep but you can't blame it all on comedy but uh 

384.06 389.36 A: yeah but y- i mean you can't blame it on com- but i but i believe sometimes it can be a do- anything that's good though 

389.87 395.61 A: uh they can use that as a bait to t- t- to to will in wh- whatever they want to will in you know what i'm saying 

396.20 400.38 A: and and you know and and and it seems just like a fish though if if you want to catch a fish though 

400.85 407.85 A: you know all you got to do is uh pu- put something i- on on the rod that they like it and then once they like it y- you reel -em on in you know what i'm saying 

407.81 408.35 B: mhm 

408.45 409.84 A: and that's the thing with uh 

410.23 421.20 A: that's the thing with uh uh humor though lot lot and and that and and that sometimes i think you do have to go (( )) even though it's funny though you definitely have to go blind and and i guess because i don't have anybody around me i just say well you know 

421.57 427.32 A: like it's all right i know the difference and i know what what i- what you know what is and what's not supposed to be you know (( )) you know 

427.93 430.98 B: well i guess what i've been doing is is basically just 

431.99 441.24 B: it's it's easy to sit in front of the t._v. and get stuck there and think why am i watching this and and i've gotten where i it it a lot of times i will just turn it off and i've 

441.40 447.20 B: taken up drawing and painting and trying to learn to play the keyboard so i you know 

447.39 448.43 B: and and i do watch 

448.57 450.71 B: t._v. but not very much i've i've sort of 

451.04 452.77 B: backed off from it because um 

453.15 457.05 B: in the long run yeah laughter's good and everything and i and i do 

457.61 459.67 B: try to get some humor in my life i'm not 

460.22 463.33 B: not uh a stick in the mud or anything but 

469.24 471.91 A: right is i- you know does i- right right we- 

471.47 476.06 B: it's not really helping me grow or develop or mature or anything too much so i 

476.40 477.06 B: i don't know 

479.04 480.41 A: say humor something like that in 

480.79 485.52 A: and i guess the only reason why i just turn on the t._v. because it's just me and sometimes you just want to hear a voice sometimes you know 

485.63 487.66 B: yeah yeah i do know because 

486.06 488.14 A: and you want to hear something in the house so you know 

488.12 493.14 B: yeah i do i live alone too and and again it does just sort of make you feel like somebody else is there 

493.72 494.61 A: right right 

494.35 494.63 B: true 

494.89 496.57 B: and i i did have um 

497.16 499.08 B: a a satellite that was 

499.47 499.91 B: eh 

500.11 507.05 B: with sky angel channels which was christian channels and they had some christian comedians on you know that were pretty funny 

507.49 509.23 A: i don't know if you've heard of jonathan um 

510.56 511.49 A: (( )) he's a black 

511.71 514.32 A: christian comedian jon i forgot his last name though you know 

515.31 522.43 A: uh jonathan i can't think of it he can but a lot of the people invite him like uh jo- i don't agree with jon hagey he invites him on his cruise ships and stuff like that you know 

522.20 532.28 B: so the yeah i i i don't know that i've seen him um and actually since i've i moved to where i am now i haven't put my satellite dish up so i'm sort of out of the loop but 

533.75 535.09 B: you know we need more of that 

535.36 540.67 A: yeah i think we need more of that i think things ought to be clean now because sometimes what happens with a lot of adults though 

541.17 548.38 A: you you figure well well kids don't do it because they you know they should know better because they younger now kids just want to follow the adults though you know 

559.40 561.94 A: funny then the ki- and then really the parents start allowing that 

564.78 565.50 B: mhm 

570.97 571.64 B: mhm
