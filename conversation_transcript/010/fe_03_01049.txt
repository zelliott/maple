0.60 2.88 B: hello my name is constance 

2.67 4.48 A: hi this is libby 

4.22 5.36 B: hi libby 

5.44 6.37 B: (( ah )) 

6.28 8.19 A: have you ever done this before 

8.03 9.54 B: no [laughter] 

8.47 11.17 A: [laughter] oh okay [laughter] this is my first time too 

9.66 10.62 B: um 

11.24 18.97 B: okay so i think we're supposed to talk about er drawing the line on bad humor i try to err on the side of ah 

19.02 22.19 B: not saying it if i think it is going to cross the line 

22.50 23.31 B: (( ah )) 

24.40 28.77 B: you know jokes that are in bad taste are just not something that i usually do 

28.74 31.05 A: um me too i um 

32.49 36.07 A: i don't know some things that some people find funny i just 

36.10 37.21 A: (( er [mn] )) 

37.73 38.96 A: don't appreciate 

39.09 52.51 B: yeah i think though probably the more interesting question is actually you know what do you do when you're confronted by you know in conversation other people that are prov- doing jokes that are not in good humor i mean do you just kinda go along do you just keep quiet do you 

52.54 56.74 B: try to change the subject sometimes i'll try to change the subject but 

54.42 55.39 A: yeah 

56.12 60.80 A: i guess that's probably more of what i do it or else i just kind of 

61.18 65.38 A: feel uncomfortable and try to ah remove myself from the whole situation 

65.81 72.18 B: i've never really confronted anybody about a joke that i thought well i think i did one time 

72.58 74.63 B: i just thought it was pretty much 

74.69 76.51 B: uncalled for and i just said 

76.53 79.42 B: you know this really is not funny but 

79.34 80.75 A: [mn] i think that would 

79.44 81.78 B: (( it was either oh go ahead )) 

81.50 84.66 A: oh that would kind of depend on how well you knew that person too 

85.12 86.05 A: like 

86.06 96.68 A: i mean if it was somebody that i really knew well and they did something i didn't like i'd probably say something different than if it was you know a situation where i really didn't know the person at all 

96.90 105.04 B: yeah i if i'm remembering correctly it was like a relative and i i don't know if it really had anything much it was kinda the er [mn] 

105.61 107.48 B: (( well what am i going to say )) 

107.57 115.49 B: the attitude that i was probably was in [laughter] on the day as well probably probably ah made it worse but ah 

116.66 120.95 B: but humor i mean i'm really one for telling jokes either so i 

121.40 128.52 B: even if you cross the line i probably don't even tell a joke that's probably funny to everybody either i'm just not a joke teller 

128.07 136.64 A: [mn] i am absolutely the world's worst joke teller i either forget the punch line or mess it up and lose the whole 

130.50 131.06 B: (( [mn] )) 

137.32 141.76 A: lose the whole joke in it so i i just don't tell jokes 

142.70 143.69 A: and 

143.93 149.03 A: i i guess i'm kinda from a family that's not into all the jokes and comedy kind of stuff 

150.36 157.28 B: yeah i mean er my family does some teasing type you know that type of thing but not really er 

153.73 156.31 A: oh yeah that no that's different 

158.05 165.37 B: i do get jokes like on the email though and some of those kinds cross the line at times but those are easier because you can just delete them and 

162.52 164.01 A: oh definitely 

164.76 166.25 A: (( right i )) 

165.68 167.93 B: and not worry about anybody else 

167.98 169.44 B: except for sometime 

169.47 176.06 B: there's some that you know some people might find offensive and then you i have to make a decision do you forward it to that person or not or 

176.32 177.64 B: or with a 

177.86 188.14 B: you know a little caveat that some of you may find this offensive and i apologize ahead of time [laughter] ah sometimes it's hard to gauge whether somebody would find it offensive or not 

188.23 191.93 B: what you find offensive is not necessarily what somebody else may 

192.45 198.32 A: guess i figure if it's offensive to me or i feel like it might bother 

198.60 204.60 A: anybody i just would hit the delete and not do anything else with it except for one friend who ah 

202.49 203.84 B: yeah but probably 

205.93 210.07 A: who has a little different sense of humor that i do she 

209.31 210.23 B: uh-huh 

210.13 215.05 A: she sends me more the political kind of of humor knowing that 

215.11 218.12 A: if it's about republicans i'm not going to like it 

217.79 219.34 B: [laughter] 

218.41 222.11 A: [laughter] but that's kind of different that's where i was kinda 

221.25 222.09 B: well 

222.22 225.70 B: i think some people do it to engage you as well 

225.83 230.80 B: i mean some people will cross the line just ah to have engaging either 

231.02 233.58 B: conversation or ah 

234.09 235.94 B: to see if you're going to bite the 

236.30 240.91 B: bite the apple or not some people just like the debate for the sake of debate i think 

237.27 239.11 A: right exactly 

241.45 242.22 B: um 

242.63 246.65 A: do you go to clubs and things where there's comedians performing 

247.34 250.81 B: no i haven't i did in college but that was a while ago 

250.85 258.19 B: ah and sometimes those can cross the line as well which is uncomfortable because you're sitting there what do you do do you get up and leave or 

258.26 270.47 A: right see i i don't go to clubs the only time i've been confronted with it was like on on a cruise ship when you know one of the c- one of the shows in the evening was a comedian that was really 

270.48 272.45 A: pretty raunchy and i guess 

272.91 282.27 A: i think i got up and left my husband and i neither one care for that kind of thing so if it got the point where we just didn't think it was funny anymore it was just 

274.76 275.67 B: uh-huh 

283.55 285.74 A: seemed like the right thing to do to leave 

285.53 286.85 B: (( right i )) 

286.86 292.81 B: mean there are lots of reasons well i mean i guess it doesn't really matter if it causes pain or not i mean the person's being 

293.09 301.38 B: offensive and sometimes maybe having that highlighted is not necessarily a bad thing because then they know they need to ah 

298.98 300.21 A: right 

301.40 304.16 B: to think twice before doing it again 

305.74 307.13 B: (( but um )) 

307.54 311.48 A: i i'm to the point i maybe i'm showing my age but ah 

310.68 311.87 B: [laughter] 

311.53 312.52 A: the ah i 

312.82 317.02 A: mean i like to watch a lot of the comedies on t._v. but it just seems like 

317.33 319.02 A: so [mn] many of them are 

319.53 324.65 A: so wrapped around sexual innuendoes 

324.75 328.94 A: that i mean my kids are out of the house now but 

328.98 338.84 A: it got to the point where i couldn't watch things with them in the evening when they were preteens and teenagers it wasn't comfortable 

339.44 340.73 A: watching 

340.89 345.43 A: comedy that was centered around so much sex 

345.50 346.80 A: even though 

347.42 349.81 A: i mean it wasn't like r. rated or anything 

349.16 350.14 B: right 

349.89 354.07 A: but you know even the innuendoes being there that ah 

354.94 360.01 A: things that i enjoyed watching by myself i just didn't watch with them 

360.12 362.37 A: which usually meant i didn't watch at all 

362.57 366.26 B: [noise] yeah i remember that as well that ah 

366.79 369.96 B: i think they're some of the shows are even getting worse 

369.99 378.16 B: they don't seem to be improving they seem to be going on that trend i mean it gosh if you just look at all the reality shows right now i mean there's 

370.07 371.57 A: i think so too 

379.22 381.95 B: very little that you can watch with ah 

382.01 385.60 B: with your child on t._v. without worrying about what they're seeing 

386.36 387.21 B: (( ah )) 

387.41 390.92 B: some of it gets close to r. rated i think 

390.51 391.38 A: yeah 

391.41 392.57 A: i right 

393.62 394.51 B: (( [sigh] )) 

395.22 398.23 B: how many minutes are in into this [laughter] 

396.21 398.29 A: (( [laughter] ah )) 

399.47 401.64 A: i don't know this is harder than i thought 

402.01 403.25 B: um 

403.88 405.31 B: (( lets see [mn] )) 

406.99 410.97 A: so what other kinds of comedy are there there's the racial comedy 

411.67 421.76 A: that is offensive to about everybody there is sexual innuendo type comedy we already talked about there's political comedy 

422.29 423.70 A: (( um )) 

423.34 426.30 B: i always think about you know like all in the family 

426.59 436.81 B: i remember watching it growing up and that it wasn't really i don't remember it being a bit deal or anything but i just think that today if that show was on i just think that it would be like this incredible 

436.92 443.32 B: big deal that a lot of groups would just be be picketing would be boycotting would be 

443.65 449.09 B: and it is it's funny to see how just the times that sometimes the 

449.28 450.86 B: i guess the comedy 

451.08 455.38 B: was acceptable at that time but now it isn't and probably the same 

453.72 454.46 A: (( [laughter] )) 

455.57 458.51 B: it could be the same joke but it is just in the time frame 

458.23 462.38 A: [mn] that was about the only show i can think of from back then 

462.65 463.53 A: that 

464.15 469.69 A: was offensive at all everything else that you know when i look back on it seems so 

470.68 475.63 A: so squeaky clean you know believe it to be the waltons the 

475.79 478.79 A: brady bunch kind of of humor 

478.94 484.57 A: that you could sit and watch with with any member of your family and not be offended in any way 

483.79 485.16 B: (( [noise] )) 

486.03 488.22 B: yeah well even for their was like er 

488.63 495.59 B: kind of sanford and brown sanford and sons they were about the same time the jeffersons they might have been a little bit later i guess 

495.00 497.05 A: yeah i didn't watch those mm 

497.83 500.37 B: like the jeffersons had a little bit you know of the 

500.49 501.91 B: biracial 

502.37 505.42 B: couple that lived upstairs that were their friends 

505.81 510.67 B: they were kind of [noise] because of course the spin off of all in the family too so 

511.12 512.60 B: (( [noise] but ah )) 

514.38 519.88 B: both kind of had the same type of humor i suppose it didn't get into the political as much [noise] as the racial though 

519.80 521.43 A: sounds like you have a baby 

519.89 520.59 B: (( [noise] )) 

521.09 529.71 B: (( yeah he just woke up from his nap i was hoping that ah that the call was yours before he woke up but he decided no that he wanted to get up so you'll be er you'll be faced with this in a few years as to what you want him to be able to ah to )) 

534.88 535.76 A: (( or )) 

536.62 539.08 B: listen to [noise] yeah and you ah 

539.50 540.49 B: (( and like ah )) 

540.54 544.14 B: i just think that the trend is more set toward ah 

545.82 548.74 B: not being acceptable speech 

548.79 561.32 B: and that you really have to watch what you're saying because i think people are more on guard and some people are more easily offended i mean i find myself sometimes 

561.84 569.07 B: even if i'm just saying something and i'll soon like looking around thinking oh who overheard you know not even thinking anything but then all of a sudden 

569.18 574.05 B: oh who might've overheard that and i wonder if they're offended or you know they know somebody who 

574.45 576.15 A: would take it the wrong way 

575.73 576.81 B: right 

577.23 578.42 B: and ah 

578.73 583.06 B: so i guess it does happen in just everyday occurrences if 

583.31 587.82 B: even when you're not even telling a joke or when you're just maybe telling a story like 

587.84 595.58 B: ah you know you went to a restaurant and you had bad service and you're trying to describe it and maybe the way that you're describing it [noise] 

595.69 597.72 B: could be offensive to other people 

597.99 599.77 B: and i don't know
