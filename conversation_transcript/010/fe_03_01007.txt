27.23 29.26 B: well i know when c._n._n. 

29.30 33.84 B: started saying about the duct tape and the and the plastic 

33.89 39.27 B: our wal-mart ran out of duct tape because people are so scared that we're gonna be attacked 

39.16 40.96 A: oh yeah i mean 

41.14 47.35 A: around here people were petrified you know my girlfriend and i talked on the phone a lot about it and 

47.79 53.83 A: you know i have old windows and i have old doors and we kinda laughed at it because at the point 

54.14 55.95 A: you almost have to laugh 

56.05 61.95 A: to get through it but i said you know it no amount of duct tape would seal my house 

61.56 63.27 B: do you have children 

62.92 66.24 A: yes i have three do you have children 

65.05 66.96 B: are they young children

71.47 76.17 B: mine are all grown and i've got a grandchildren and that 

76.76 81.30 B: worries me that everybody would be scattered that i wouldn't know 

77.09 79.89 A: (( old )) 

81.51 85.47 B: if everybody was all right and i wouldn't be able to get in touch with everyone 

85.17 89.08 A: yeah that scares me i also have two brothers that are in the military 

88.89 89.76 B: oh 

89.79 91.00 A: that are going 

89.90 91.94 B: anybody that's shipped out yet wow 

92.20 96.10 A: um no but by the end of the month they both will be 

95.42 96.68 B: oh my goodness 

96.57 101.71 A: so you know that's a constant on my mind thing and ah 

102.14 108.26 A: you know the terrorism facts are just so mind boggling and scary 

108.72 113.64 A: that i don't i don't know that i could be calm knowing that they were attacking right now 

115.21 118.18 B: do you really feel like they're going to attack us 

118.58 122.15 A: i do think it's possible i mean they did it 

122.74 125.69 A: with no aggravation you know 

124.70 127.93 B: well with nine one one yes they did 

128.17 129.40 B: but 

130.33 140.02 B: these things if they were to take the time to do these kind of things which i don't know that they're going to have the time because they're they're gonna be under attack themselves 

140.20 142.27 A: yeah i definitely think that's helping 

142.00 152.67 B: um but i think that um if anything were to happen and not to say that i would rather be it somewhere else but i live out in a rural area and if it happens it's gonna happen in 

152.56 157.02 B: new york city or washington d._c. or los angeles or one of the 

154.79 156.55 A: oh yeah 

157.15 159.99 B: population capitals where they can 

160.19 165.27 B: kill more people than they can kill out in rural areas i'm really not that 

163.63 164.69 A: right 

165.38 178.18 B: that worried about myself or my own home i'm like i say i'm worried about my family being my extended family my brothers and sisters and cousins not being not being able to find out if anybody was hurt or 

168.72 169.62 A: right 

178.14 184.63 B: um i definite- we don't have anybody that's in the military at this time thank goodness but um oh my goodness 

178.84 180.76 A: yeah i think that's my biggest fear 

183.91 194.03 A: yeah 'cause it's definitely i don't know that it's more scary but there's more people at risk i have a lot of friends that are also in the military so i know about fifteen people 

194.80 200.85 A: that are involved and you know the bag the big thing with me is fear in numbers the more people you know going 

201.00 204.14 A: the more likely you are to know somebody that doesn't come back 

202.31 204.45 B: (( right somebody's not gonna come back )) 

205.61 213.38 A: and you know that's definitely something that fear that i'm afraid of and i'm afraid that 

213.27 220.90 A: i agree with you i don't think they're gonna hit rural areas i think if they do attack i think they are gonna hit more of the big cities because they want to hurt people 

220.90 233.00 A: more people but i do live close to a big city which makes it more for more fearful for me um and i do fear for the family factor i don't live close to any of my family 

233.07 234.29 A: so 

234.34 244.15 A: if they did start to attack or we did start to have something go on here it would be very hard for me to get in contact and to be close to my family 

244.47 246.44 A: and that would be something 

245.56 248.69 B: yeah and that in itself causes its own kind of panic 

248.39 251.80 A: oh yeah anxiety all the time i think 

250.72 263.80 B: and i think that the the terrorists did when they when they hit the word trade centers they accomplished more than they could of ever dreamed of not just knocking down the towers and killing three thousand americans but they 

261.28 262.22 A: oh 

263.42 265.29 A: i agree a hundred per cent 

264.51 268.92 B: they threw a whole country into into a 

268.80 269.86 A: a fear 

269.45 276.58 B: a fear of this can happen to us but because before september eleventh we would never have thought this could of happened to us 

275.95 281.77 A: no we were untouchable in our minds they would of never why would anybody want to just attack us 

282.48 289.37 A: you know what i mean like that's a lot of people felt that way why would you even want to attack us for you know what are you gonna gain 

288.34 290.29 B: well because we give 

290.49 293.76 B: billions of dollars away every year 

293.23 294.17 A: right 

293.82 300.59 B: thinking that we're doing good and now we're being told that we're arrogant and we don't give our money to the right people 

300.17 301.99 A: right 

300.69 305.09 B: well heaven forbid it's our money can't we give it to who we want to give it to [laughter] 

304.40 305.17 A: right 

305.29 316.39 A: it's kind of one of those and not to use the language but you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't that's the way i kinda look at the whole factor with this i don't think i we could do anything 

310.11 311.23 B: that's right 

316.46 318.63 A: to make it different just like you know 

318.44 324.21 B: but i do still feel like that diplomacy needs to be given a little bit better chance 

324.35 328.60 B: i'm not saying we shouldn't go in and get rid of this man because 

329.01 333.92 B: i do feel like eventually we're going to have to do that [noise] i thought that ten years ago 

333.55 336.17 A: right the guy's never complied 

335.80 336.92 B: but ah 

336.59 344.50 A: he's never done anything to change he's never going to change but do we feel that my biggest thing with all of this is the war 

344.87 347.34 A: i'm all for finding the terrorists 

347.36 350.67 A: but why we're going to go over there and mess with saddam hussein 

351.03 356.84 A: who i understand that he you know gives money to terrorists but he didn't do the world trade center 

357.20 361.31 A: let's find the terrorists and kill them then worry about everyone else 

361.36 372.30 B: i mean i think we should keep the pressure on through the u._n. but i don't think that we should go in without the support of the united nations and the other world powers 

364.74 365.95 A: oh me too 

372.06 374.01 A: i'm definitely afraid to go 

374.23 378.60 A: the fear that we're going in alone now i understand and george bush would say 

379.01 386.16 A: you know but we'll win regardless it's not the factor of winning i agree with him i do think that we'll win regardless 

386.36 390.48 A: it's not so much the winning it's how much life do we have to give up to win 

390.30 395.50 B: right and well i came up through the through the vietnam era 

395.22 397.03 A: mhm 

395.56 401.95 B: and um i'm not so sure that we're gonna win regardless because we did not win in vietnam 

401.89 402.71 A: right 

402.25 412.66 B: and most i had you know lots of friends that went over a brother that went over they came back some them came back some of them came back sick and hurt and 

412.73 414.49 B: some of them didn't come back 

414.55 416.00 B: um but 

415.03 417.41 A: but it drastically changed all of them 

416.98 422.14 B: it also changed my opinion of first off can we believe everything we're being told 

421.59 422.37 A: no 

422.43 424.41 B: and can 

425.16 437.75 B: can we actually win i mean if we were just going to fight this one little country but is the rest of the muslim world going to jump in or are the north koreans going to say oh look they're busy down there in iraq let's bomb 

432.60 434.31 A: (( yeah )) 

437.61 439.14 A: yeah let's get them now 

438.33 441.67 B: them let's get them now while their backs are somewhere else 

441.27 442.52 A: while they're weak 

443.42 448.00 B: so i and they supposedly have nuclear weapons and 

448.68 451.56 A: which is a whole other subject i can't you know i 

450.15 451.35 B: [laughter] 

451.98 453.22 A: (( nuclear )) 

453.49 460.45 A: you might as well just blow up the planet i mean if you're going to start a nuclear war you might as well just forget it 'cause my thought on the nuclear part of it is 

460.66 463.98 A: if they use any nuclear weapons they're gonna kill everybody 

463.23 464.94 B: there's nowhere to hide 

464.64 468.82 A: there's nowhere to hide you're gonna ruin the whole planet 'cause if they hit us we're gonna hit them 

469.13 472.06 A: and the next thing you know the whole world's gonna be destroyed 

472.63 476.96 A: so i don't know why nuclear has to be brought into it at all 

477.12 482.40 A: i think it's a very scary factor i think terrorism in itself is 

483.08 488.59 A: the fact that people have been brainwashed to believe 

488.77 491.89 A: in a god that wants you to kill other people 

492.05 499.29 A: and i almost and i know this is going to sound hideous but i almost feel bad for the men that killed themselves 

499.45 505.01 A: because they killed themselves believing that that's what their god wanted them to do and now 

505.07 506.80 A: they're burning in hell 

507.05 509.67 A: for something they thought was the right thing to do 

510.19 511.16 B: yes 

510.95 515.17 A: it's a shame i mean if you start to really look into terrorism 

515.33 518.26 A: it's a shame there's 

516.27 519.41 B: but then we have had holy wars all through 

519.45 520.82 B: all through the 

520.93 523.02 B: last two thousand years in 

522.49 525.47 A: oh yeah i mean they're always going on 

524.33 527.50 B: the name of religion more people have died 

527.35 529.51 A: oh yeah look at jerusalem 

529.60 533.43 A: (( )) oh i mean they're 

530.29 531.88 B: isn't that a shame 

532.79 542.54 B: look at what's going on christmas eve in the holiest part of of the land the the place where we feel like is the most holy and 

541.39 544.53 A: yeah i mean it's god's chosen place 

542.84 544.94 B: they were having bombings and 

544.88 554.90 A: yeah they're killing people there i mean every day it goes on there what happened to us on september eleventh happens in other parts of the world constantly 

554.47 556.96 B: yeah well especially in israel 

556.79 559.24 A: oh in israel it's just 

557.26 562.83 B: you've got to feel sorry for those people because they live with terrorism all all the time 

559.40 560.41 A: oh 

562.61 564.77 A: always and you know that's one thing 

563.55 567.58 B: they can't get on a bus without wondering whether or not it's gonna be blown up 

567.04 569.37 A: yeah are they gonna survive the bus ride 

568.92 573.18 B: some people those poor people that were having their wedding reception and had 

573.19 577.81 B: a bomber walk in and blow them up that that's a shame 

576.37 587.23 A: it is insane and the fact that these terrorists believe they're doing the right thing is insanity to me how can you how can you ever justify 

587.20 599.89 A: killing people that you don't even know i mean i don't even think you should kill people you do know you know what i mean even if you hate somebody it's not right to just kill it's not your choice to kill people so for these people to have been so
