1.22 1.89 A: hello 

1.85 2.41 B: hello 

4.17 4.78 B: hi my 

4.25 4.97 A: my name is chris 

5.36 5.66 B: i'm 

5.36 6.08 A: go ahead 

5.91 7.55 B: i'm sorry hi my name is maria 

8.02 9.36 A: hi i'm christina 

9.44 10.02 B: hi 

9.88 11.15 A: how are you 

10.81 12.70 B: okay how are you 

11.93 13.00 A: good 

13.10 13.71 B: um 

13.89 17.78 B: i'm not really sure i think it would have to depend on what the situation was 

18.74 19.30 B: about 

19.50 20.24 B: i guess 

20.35 25.22 B: doing the perjury i seem think i'm a pretty honest person but 

25.51 28.46 B: i don't know i guess it would depend on if it was something 

28.84 31.70 B: that happened that was really really bad and i needed to 

31.97 32.96 B: defend them 

34.22 37.35 B: but something bad was done to like say a child then 

37.46 43.82 B: my family member did something back i think i would defend them and say and lie to save them 

47.39 48.44 A: i don't think i would 

48.56 49.17 A: um 

49.53 50.93 A: commit perjury at all 

51.24 52.04 A: only 

52.24 54.75 A: unless i was sure that 

55.06 56.88 A: you know the person was being set up 

57.28 58.90 A: and i'd have to be pretty sure 

59.20 66.60 B: right like i know i'm pretty honest like i don't know if something was done to a child and my family did something 

66.87 68.95 B: back to the person who did it and 

69.11 71.72 B: the only way to save them and help them 

72.73 74.31 B: the good person i think i would 

74.52 76.06 B: i probably would but 

76.65 79.76 B: i'm not sure i've never had to lie before so 

80.75 84.12 A: yeah but i think usually in those cases like if it's um 

85.72 88.81 A: well i guess it depends but um sometimes it's 

88.90 91.15 A: in those kinds of cases the person 

91.60 94.99 A: the jury will probably not convict them so 

95.09 96.26 A: then there is usually 

96.38 98.79 A: enough evidence anyways for you not to 

99.38 100.58 A: sit there and lie 

100.71 101.31 A: because 

100.72 101.14 B: right 

101.58 107.96 A: because if you sit there and lie then you're going to jail and then you're not really helping that person because you made 

107.16 108.42 B: yeah i guess so right 

108.61 111.02 A: yeah you may be of more help to them if you're 

111.65 114.21 A: you know if you're not in jail too 

114.30 118.95 B: right but i mean but far as like stealing or killing no i 

115.34 116.22 A: you know 

119.06 129.38 B: definitely i could not see my self protecting some one i mean as far as loving them but to lie for them no if they did something that 

129.80 133.72 B: bad then i guess you know i guess everybody deserves what they get 

134.49 135.14 B: i'm not 

135.37 139.49 B: you know big on defending you know i mean if you did something wrong you did it 

140.19 143.22 B: but as far as against kids you know i don't know 

140.59 141.04 A: yeah 

143.72 144.34 B: can't say 

145.24 147.88 A: yeah that's that's a tough one 

148.04 148.72 A: but um 

149.26 151.41 A: i still don't think that i could do i could 

151.74 152.23 A: um 

153.10 159.64 A: sit there and lie be- only because if there's already a court cause there's probably already enough evidence 

159.90 161.93 A: they probably wouldn't just be based on 

162.03 163.87 A: you know what one person says 

164.55 166.13 A: you know there'd probably be physic- 

166.39 167.89 A: physical evidence and 

169.27 172.31 A: you know usually like people who aren't criminals 

172.85 173.64 A: um 

174.21 176.04 A: and they do something you know 

176.15 176.92 A: they don't 

177.07 177.96 A: really cover 

178.54 179.44 A: their um 

179.65 186.65 A: tracks you know what i mean (( )) like if somebody did something out of passion 

181.09 181.66 B: right 

187.64 188.44 A: uh 

188.70 189.40 A: you know like 

189.69 197.51 A: defending a child or something like that or you like if a child had been molested and and they took action against the other person or something 

197.64 198.02 B: right 

198.31 199.54 A: they wouldn't um 

200.70 205.24 A: you know they wouldn't be thinking like a criminal so they would probably leave all kinds of evidence 

204.65 211.73 B: right i wouldn't be able to defend them because we wouldn't be good enough criminals to do it 

205.84 206.33 A: (( )) 

211.38 211.96 A: yeah 

212.03 212.41 B: that's 

212.15 217.41 A: it it wouldn- it wouldn't be worth you know it wouldn't be worth it for everybody to get in trouble 

212.58 212.96 B: that 

217.52 217.92 B: no 

217.60 218.16 A: you know 

218.32 225.15 B: but i guess (( )) and if everyone has the same thing in mind that you would defend family or friends then i guess we just 

225.98 229.90 B: better not have any kind of criminal justice because then it would never work 

229.71 231.73 A: that's true 

230.41 237.01 B: it would just be pointless if we all got on the stand just to defend our family 

237.85 239.35 A: yeah and that would be kind of 

239.96 243.74 A: weird to have family that who would expect you to lie for them 

242.42 243.41 B: expect right 

245.22 248.86 A: yeah you'd have to really care about them if they 

247.88 248.78 B: exactly 

248.96 251.29 A: if they ask you to lie for them you know 

251.44 255.76 A: depending (( )) on what it is 

255.89 257.45 A: what they did but um 

257.68 260.65 A: i would say for the most part i probably wouldn't 

260.78 262.41 B: alright i guess there's nothing that's 

260.83 261.75 A: am 

262.89 263.38 B: you know 

263.68 266.31 B: good enough bad enough that you would have to lie 

280.86 281.40 A: yeah 

285.98 287.37 A: yeah and um 

289.26 294.64 A: me too i think that you know (( )) it's very scary being in a court room um 

294.84 299.95 A: i actually (( i got divorced and )) i though that was pretty terrifying with a lawyer and everything 

306.24 307.73 A: i know 

310.51 320.88 B: block i guess just patrolling because i live on a school block and i'm just looking like am i doing something am i not walking the right way because right away you know the way you're brought up 

321.64 332.79 B: i guess that's the whole things with values and stuff you just you know you know there's rules and you know you're not supposed to do certain things and lie and your always like making sure am i doing everything i'm supposed to do 

333.37 335.24 A: you have the same reaction like 

335.38 339.35 A: you know when you're driving in the car and the police come up behind you i'm like 

339.61 344.76 A: is my tag expired do they know about my parking tickets 

341.07 341.68 B: right 

344.80 345.40 B: exactly 

344.98 345.54 A: you know 

345.62 348.76 B: and i've never i've never been in a court so i'm sure 

349.07 360.73 B: you know i don't drive so even for a traffic ticket i've never had to go into to court so i'm sure that i would just contemplating that i might have to say something forget about even lying make me nervous enough 

361.02 363.56 A: yeah it's pretty scary going in a court room 

363.72 364.19 A: um 

364.82 368.40 A: i mean even if you know even if you know you haven't done anything you're innocent it's just 

369.70 372.89 A: i don't know because the judges have so much power over you 

372.77 376.73 B: right you always feel guilty anyway (( like )) you didn't even do anything and you're like wait 

374.82 375.74 A: yeah 

377.31 379.86 B: you know did i do something why am i here 

377.60 378.41 A: yeah 

381.27 384.19 B: just to bad the kids today can't think the same way 

385.05 388.50 A: yeah like a lot of kids don't have respect for the police 

398.58 400.58 B: got to always tell the truth 

401.84 402.34 A: uh-huh 

402.51 402.99 A: yeah 

404.92 414.26 B: yeah so they at least always have that instilled in their head police and firemen and you know being in court in certain spots that you're always supposed to be 

414.37 416.22 B: you know respectful and telling the truth 

416.91 419.98 B: i think a lot of the kids have lost that so 

420.64 422.28 B: lying comes a little easier 

422.69 424.10 A: yeah i think it's hard 

424.44 427.98 A: harder where i live because i live in atlanta and they've had a lot of problems with 

428.30 428.65 A: (( )) 

428.84 429.64 A: police men 

430.57 431.38 A: and um 

431.74 432.77 A: they have 

432.96 434.12 A: uh actually the 

434.60 437.09 A: there was like there was a sheriff who um 

437.52 438.85 A: was killed by 

439.11 440.39 A: the previous sheriff 

440.80 441.43 B: oh wow 

441.07 441.52 A: and 

441.71 442.94 A: yeah and the police 

443.15 445.65 A: and some of the deputies were in on it 

446.66 447.60 A: it was um 

448.03 450.09 A: pretty demoralizing you know 

451.65 452.19 B: wow 

452.47 453.37 A: and it took them 

453.50 457.96 A: i think it took them like a couple of a ye- at least a year and a half before they 

458.48 460.73 A: um arrested the deputies and then 

461.21 463.38 A: the ones who actually did um 

464.87 466.31 A: the killing the shooting 

466.57 468.09 A: they got off they were acquitted 

468.70 469.38 B: wow 

468.73 469.49 A: and um 

469.64 472.06 A: yeah so then they decided to send the case 

472.52 475.98 A: out of the county so they sent it to like a rural part of georgia 

476.48 477.42 A: and the 

477.87 478.14 A: the 

478.26 480.71 A: previous sheriff who had masterminded everything 

481.21 483.71 A: he was convicted and got life in prison 

485.04 491.07 B: wow i thought because i'm from new york and they just had um two police were killed this week 

491.48 492.18 A: wow 

491.82 494.40 B: and they're automatically all getting the death penalty 

494.62 496.44 B: i thought that was an automatic when uh 

496.73 498.33 B: cop or sheriff 

499.03 501.06 B: but i guess when you're the sheriff 

501.16 503.71 B: doing the killing th- i guess it's not the same rules 

503.91 504.49 A: yeah 

504.75 505.75 A: he was a horrible 

506.07 506.57 A: um 

507.10 512.04 A: person i mean he just had so many different scandals going on in the um 

512.62 516.12 A: you know in the jail like ah with the bonds people he was 

516.88 518.89 A: um there was a bonds lady that he was 

519.33 522.79 A: you know he told her she had to have sex with him in in order to 

522.89 524.73 A: keep being a bonds woman and 

524.31 525.42 B: wow 

525.25 527.82 A: i know he was awful then like the 

528.81 529.66 A: the um 

529.79 531.33 A: the food contracts like 

531.56 533.37 A: you know who ever gives the food 

533.59 536.41 A: the cafeteria food or what ever for the jail 

536.78 539.11 A: those where like relatives of his and 

540.22 542.18 A: he was a horrible person 

541.54 545.80 B: wow well i guess then if he was asked the question about lying he would have no problem 

542.69 542.97 A: yeah 

546.02 556.60 B: i mean you take all these oaths and that's the whole thing with nowadays you take these oaths and you just respect these people and here they turn out to be worse than regular citizens i mean that's horrible 

546.18 547.43 A: oh no problem 

557.47 562.95 A: and of course they gave one of the shooters immunity to testify against the other two 

563.67 564.70 A: that were acquitted 

563.77 564.14 B: oh 

565.12 565.95 B: oh god 

565.74 566.13 A: so 

566.27 567.74 A: and he was so shady 

567.89 569.52 A: they said he came off so shady that 

569.71 571.71 A: the jury just didn't even believe him 

571.97 572.76 B: wow 

572.81 573.31 A: yeah 

573.76 574.66 B: that's horrible 

573.80 577.46 A: so but but then when they went to the funny thing is but when they when they went to the rural 

578.04 580.86 A: part of georgia you know out in the country 

581.05 586.39 A: that the country people were like oh no you know he did all this stuff and they 

586.55 587.90 A: completely believed it 

590.49 590.90 B: um 

591.25 592.24 B: to bad on him 

592.62 593.09 A: i know 

596.78 597.83 A: i'm glad he has family 

596.84 598.76 B: you don't even sound like your southern
