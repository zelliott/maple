6.75 7.43 B: ah 

7.76 10.84 B: um and what was the topic again i couldn't h- 

9.45 14.50 A: the topic is perjury would you ever um perjure yourself for a friend 

14.82 15.81 B: um 

16.14 21.80 B: i don't think i would just out of fear of getting caught [laughter] 

19.54 23.68 A: yeah well i i myself i wouldn't do it um 

23.84 26.62 A: not just for fear of getting caught um 

25.47 26.81 B: [noise] 

27.34 28.64 A: i also just 

28.79 32.25 A: ethically i just don't i don't think it's right 

31.92 38.06 B: [noise] right well that's a a good reason too but um i'm ah 

38.44 47.98 B: i am one of those people who [noise] um follows follows the rules i guess i don't like taking chances and um being a 

43.68 44.63 A: yeah 

48.34 54.19 B: a family person i would never put my family at danger for somebody else so 

53.23 56.71 A: no i wouldn't either i i totally agree with you i um 

57.29 61.63 A: i can't think of any circumstances that um 

57.89 58.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

62.80 65.43 A: that would call for perjuring yourself 

65.36 66.66 B: (( [noise] right )) 

66.26 71.48 A: e- even if it was a you know close friend or family member um 

70.64 71.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

71.51 77.00 A: like you said putting putting your family or anyone else at at risk i i don't think it's worth it 

77.23 85.23 B: no i don't either um and let's see i also was brought up in a in a very moral family 

85.00 86.03 A: right 

85.25 99.96 B: and a- have a strong religious background and um you you just you know you have rules that you follow and i just i don't enjoy breaking 'em and if i feel guilty about something then 

100.11 104.08 B: ah or i don't like feeling guilty about something it just makes my 

104.16 109.41 B: my insides feel all uptight and [laughter] i i just can't handle that feeling 

106.77 107.68 A: right 

109.22 112.26 A: yeah i i think it comes down to um 

109.74 110.48 B: so 

112.86 125.41 A: if you're going to perjure yourself i think it's the type of person like you're talking about how how you were brought up i mean i think you know if you're a basically an honest person you know the difference between w- right and wrong that that's 

125.72 129.15 A: it's not even going to come into play that's not something that you would even 

128.37 129.45 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

129.27 139.09 A: put yourself in that sort of situation um you know a lot i g- i think has to do with your own upbringing and values y- you know as as growing up 

136.49 137.64 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

139.13 143.10 A: i too myself you know my parents put a lot of um 

143.42 145.16 A: good values and 

145.25 157.08 A: always instilled in me you know to always be honest and you know treat people with respect and i i just i guess i i just could never do that so 

154.97 155.67 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

156.54 160.44 B: right yeah that's that's how i feel too 

160.82 161.66 B: um 

161.83 169.48 B: and i just i've been in situations i guess where my like family members and stuff have tried 

169.53 170.35 B: (( ah )) 

170.42 177.02 B: i guess not really i don't know they've just tried lying to get out of situations and it always comes back on 'em 

173.89 174.94 A: right 

176.25 177.84 A: it it does 

177.46 182.23 B: and um so i just i don't see the point [laughter] in it [laughter] 

181.37 190.73 A: no i i think even if um you know at the time if someone doesn't find out i think eventually in the end um 

182.25 183.04 B: it's 

190.99 195.55 A: s- you know someone someone will someone will know you know 

191.89 193.50 B: some somebody will 

194.65 195.54 B: yeah 

195.60 200.22 B: and i also have a way of um when i have ah 

200.54 204.65 B: lied about something like to my parents or whatever i end up 

204.82 218.29 B: ah spilling my guts [laughter] i mean and so putting myself in that position like i said now where i'm a mom and have kids and a husband um there's just not it doesn't make any sense to me 

206.64 207.47 A: right 

217.40 218.47 A: no 

218.52 219.55 B: so 

218.55 226.93 A: it it doesn't make any sense to me i guess maybe some people that um you know on the flip side maybe people that would do it um 

227.41 232.06 A: i i guess under certain circumstances you know maybe people 

232.50 236.18 A: in fearful situations i'm i'm just trying to think of when 

236.00 236.57 B: (( [noise] )) 

236.54 249.00 A: maybe someone would put themselves at at risk and ah you know maybe they some sort of case that they were fearful for their life um you know maybe in that 

238.15 239.95 B: [noise] would do that 

247.48 248.42 B: right 

249.20 251.77 A: sort of circumstance maybe somebody 

251.97 260.53 A: you know um i'm trying to think and maybe that would be a circumstance i'm not saying that i agree with it but that could be a reason where where someone could 

258.11 259.09 B: (( [laughter] )) 

260.78 265.37 A: you know perjure themselves um to lie um 

263.29 264.31 B: right 

266.21 274.62 B: yeah that would be about the only circumstance i would have too is if you were like you said in fear of maybe your life or um 

268.34 269.35 A: yeah 

273.04 277.52 A: yeah or someone else close to you i guess maybe thinking that 

277.62 282.60 A: you know um i- if you didn't agree upon um 

282.61 296.18 A: doing as you were told that even if it wasn't for you maybe there were threats that were going to be put upon your family or friends um a- and maybe under that maybe you would feel that you had no no other choice 

289.52 290.52 B: right 

296.34 299.31 A: um but to do make that decision 

296.37 297.39 B: right 

299.49 300.44 B: right 

300.50 301.71 B: that's true 

302.13 304.45 B: um so what do you do for a living 

304.44 305.86 A: i'm a manager 

305.72 318.83 B: a manager okay i'm just a a cook at a chevron i cook fried chicken and stuff [laughter] so but you sound as like ah you might have some knowledge or background or 

312.14 313.30 A: oh 

318.76 321.78 B: something in on the subject i thought maybe you were 

322.03 323.90 B: in the law field or 

322.81 327.80 A: no actually my dad actually has um his background is in law 

327.95 328.96 B: okay 

328.03 329.23 A: so um 

329.99 331.06 A: (( i- that's )) 

330.17 332.22 B: has he ever had anybody 

332.41 334.48 B: um i g- is he a lawyer or 

334.17 337.56 A: n- he used to um he used to be f._b._i. 

334.72 335.50 B: not 

337.67 338.53 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

337.73 345.45 A: and he um so his background is in law he has his law degree and um 

345.75 358.47 A: so i was i guess a lot of my background comes from him you know him always my dad's a very honest person so um he always instilled in me growing up so [mn] 

354.04 355.03 B: right 

355.36 356.11 B: [noise] 

358.48 360.48 B: right well that's good 

360.47 374.31 B: my ah step dad was the one who who gave [laughter] gave me my morals and turned my mom around so to speak i guess and ah 'cause when she was single you know it's just 

374.27 382.74 B: you're raising three kids and you're trying to find somebody to help you do that so a lot of her nights were spent out and about and ah 

383.11 387.45 B: so when he came along and they got married then he 

387.83 390.62 B: just um s- well i already 

390.68 404.61 B: already been a churchgoer and what not but he reinforced that because my mom wasn't a churchgoer and ah made the the bible an avid part of our lives more so and then with my mom 

404.59 407.25 B: being right there along with me you know it it 

407.61 416.24 B: was something more that i was interested in doing because i had the support of two parents now rather than just my two sisters so 

413.61 414.54 A: (( right i- )) 

416.57 417.84 B: um that's where 

417.92 426.23 B: where i get a lot of my stuff from is from my step dad and i just i'm really thankful that he came along [laughter] and there's 

424.96 431.57 A: it's it's funny the impact your your family they have such a huge impact on 

426.28 426.98 B: no 

432.14 435.93 A: on all your values and your your your thoughts 

433.82 435.76 B: right 

436.19 447.97 B: yeah that's tru- that's true i i can't believe it [laughter] personally but um i am glad that he got got us all straightened out so to speak and um 

448.81 457.18 B: ah i can now pass that on to my children and hopefully do just as good a job as he did 

457.26 458.37 B: but um 

458.78 462.17 B: that i i just that's where i 

462.25 467.24 B: i get my morals from i guess [laughter] and i don't know why 

467.50 473.04 B: other than the circumstance you mentioned why people would would do something like that 

471.79 473.30 A: yeah i i 

473.35 477.58 A: like i said i can't think of you know you try and look on the flipside but 

477.67 478.75 A: i just 

479.30 483.00 A: you know i i just can't think of any reason because 

483.78 495.52 A: you know even you think about with um clinton um regardless of you know what anyone thought of him you know even if you had thought he was a great president um 

487.90 489.04 B: (( mhm )) 

491.63 492.59 B: [noise] 

496.07 501.06 A: just with him lying you know it makes you lose total respect 

498.10 499.17 B: right 

501.08 502.32 B: yeah 

501.52 506.51 A: for for someone you know regardless of what you think of someone um 

507.04 514.05 A: y- you just once someone lies it's just like how can you know you lose respect you can't trust them 

512.55 513.70 B: (( [mn] right [noise] )) 

513.96 521.02 B: yeah that's actually ah a good example right there i hadn't even thought of him and that i mean he's like the 

514.68 515.73 A: so 

521.08 525.11 B: the prime example i would say [laughter] of this so 

522.13 523.59 A: right you you know 

524.34 529.13 A: someone especially someone in you know such power you know it's just 

528.94 530.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

530.43 533.40 A: (( you know someone that's supposed to hold )) 

533.73 535.69 A: a- such high esteem and then 

535.92 537.77 A: does that that 

537.82 538.42 B: [noise] 

539.22 540.92 B: [noise] yeah that's ah 

541.38 545.22 B: that's kind of taking advantage of your power i suppose [laughter] 

544.32 545.16 A: yeah 

545.60 547.27 B: so um 

548.51 551.70 B: i don't i i don't think he should have 

551.75 560.11 B: i don't know i think he should have been thrown out you know or resigned or something i don't think he should have got to finish his term 

554.93 556.43 A: yeah i 

560.48 561.34 B: so 

560.51 564.63 A: well i- it's like the whole thing is you know um 

565.27 566.67 A: it wouldn't been 

567.11 568.43 A: such a 

568.49 571.98 A: bad circumstances if he just would have been honest about it 

571.60 573.37 B: [noise] [noise] right 

572.29 575.78 A: you know and that's the whole thing it's like 

575.99 583.21 A: if you do something own up to it and um i think that was that made it even worse 

578.57 579.95 B: (( [noise] right )) 

584.46 588.68 B: yeah that's ah that definitely didn't help his 

588.85 592.81 B: his position in my eyes anyway [laughter] he 

591.01 595.61 A: yeah no you and all other americans [laughter] 

594.63 597.59 B: right and then i'm wondering 

597.96 599.17 B: w- um
