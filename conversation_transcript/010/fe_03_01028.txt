9.76 20.86 A: (( you feel i agree i mean especially um you know [cough] prime example was when we had um nine eleven attacks obviously um we had never experienced anything li- anything like that and er this knowing who who er would have thought that they would use um planes as suicide t- you know weapons to knock out whole buildings [laughter] yeah i mean you did bring up a good point about [laughter] that's true um it happening in our own in the homeland cause um you know i never expected anything like that to ever happen here where )) 

21.87 23.74 A: (( we live at from ah another country so you know )) 

24.11 27.29 B: um i don't think i think i think most people would um 

27.35 30.47 B: i think most people would panic i think it's um 

30.79 33.50 B: i i don't think anything can prepare you for 

33.54 34.53 A: (( that kinda )) 

34.01 34.97 B: um 

35.61 40.52 B: no matter how prepared you think you are i think you know most people would find themselves 

41.15 43.61 B: ah definitely in a state of panic [laughter] 

45.51 47.59 A: (( kinda woke me up somewhat seeing um )) 

47.70 50.18 A: (( we're we're just as vulnerable as any other country now- er ))

68.46 73.39 B: [noise] yeah well i mean i i think the biggest thing was especially because it was you know 

73.72 75.33 B: on our land [laughter] 

75.46 79.08 B: you know that that i think that came as more of a shock 

79.13 83.63 B: that um i i i don't think a lot of you know americans 

84.34 87.35 B: are prepared for the idea that we can be attacked here 

87.39 92.65 B: on our land you know it's a little bit easier for people to be a little bit more 

92.60 103.57 B: relaxed and um sure it's upsetting to see it when it happens you know overseas or somewhere else but when it happens here you know in the homeland i think it's like 

104.15 111.88 B: it's definitely a shock and i don't i don't think you know if it were to happen again i i i don't there's no amount of 

111.95 116.10 B: preparedness you know we're not a nation that's normally 

117.70 121.17 B: yeah it's not it's not a just not something that happens here 

121.76 131.26 A: (( it just i don't know it it it kinda scares me i agree with you there 'cause um with terrorists the rules have changed because um you don't know who you're dealing with or er these people don't )) 

131.29 133.10 A: (( care about um their life or anybody else )) 

133.18 137.19 A: (( i i mean that's how the way i feel so you know ))

271.94 273.23 B: (( know )) 

274.73 277.20 B: (( just doesn't care [laughter] )) 

279.22 281.17 B: (( period you )) 

282.11 283.91 B: (( know i mean )) 

284.13 285.20 B: that's a 

285.55 286.47 B: (( sick )) 

288.08 291.39 A: [laughter] that's true that's true um 

288.68 289.68 B: person 

292.41 303.87 A: the way terrorists the terrorists work it is very difficult to get back at them i don't know how you get back at them um i don't know if anybody has has even answered that question how do you get back at a terrorist 

303.95 310.67 A: and um i'm sure there has to be someway you get back at them but um myself i don't know ah 

310.99 314.00 B: [noise] i don't know i think we're on the right track now i think that um 

314.71 315.83 B: i think er 

317.08 328.19 B: you know personally i i was never a big fan of bush but you know i think he's taken the right stand now and it's going to be terribly disappointing to me if he turns around and doesn't follow through with his word 

328.24 334.59 B: i think i'm gonna be a little upset because you know he had a good point when he spoke the other night about terrorism 

334.68 343.40 B: you know saddam hussein may not have been directly linked to what happened on september eleventh however he is a terrorist he he you know it just because it didn't directly 

343.77 352.10 B: you know it has affected us in different ways but not not the way nine eleven did and no he wasn't directly responsible but he had a part in it because 

352.18 356.57 B: of of the part that he takes in the world today 

356.98 359.50 B: you know and i think we need to take care of that 

360.50 366.31 A: that is true the only think i'm kinda disappointed with bush myself is it seems like ah 

366.70 368.61 A: he's changed his direction 

368.57 382.78 A: you know of going after ah bin laden and all of a sudden he's ah foc- focusing a lot more attention on trying to get saddam um saddam hussein out of out of power i understand him doing that but you know i think we should have taken care of 

378.90 379.91 B: well i think 

383.01 388.80 A: bin laden at first and just um get rid of him but it seems like since er he got discouraged because ah 

388.95 398.64 A: we couldn't find him or locate him and we were having er a hard time getting any ah getting close to him he was just e- evading us with seems like ah with no problem 

398.66 399.43 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

399.52 401.43 B: i don't think that's necessarily 

401.46 409.68 B: i think that um i think that they are working on that but i think that a bigger problem arose with iraq when iraq directly 

409.85 412.52 B: when saddam hussein directly defied 

412.55 413.52 B: you know 

413.76 425.77 B: [noise] ah you know what he was asked to do and that i i don't think you know he is the one person that i definitely do not think needs to have you know nuclear weapons or [laughter] any kind of weapons you know of mass destruction 

425.83 427.47 B: i mean the man's a loon 

427.44 429.52 A: i agree with you there but 

427.87 434.43 B: and i i don't think he gives a damn and you know as much i mean as for what bin laden did 

434.55 442.84 B: you know i i don't think [noise] i mean i don't think that's a dead issue in the water i just think that a a bigger priority right now is getting rid of 

442.64 451.14 B: you know hussein's been sitting back and building up you know and if they don't if they don't handle it now he's gonna build up more and then what happens 

451.34 453.50 A: (( [noise] yeah that's true )) 

451.69 462.62 B: you know bin bin laden is a is a little person and yeah he has a big effect in what he you know in what he did but i think we've taken out most of 

462.71 467.89 B: you know his his his his little force there has been diminished 

468.13 469.24 B: i think 

469.49 470.52 B: you know 

470.83 477.85 B: to a point where finding him is a matter of you know days i really don't think it's gonna be much longer than that 

478.26 486.66 A: yeah i hope you're right and another that has me concerned somewhat is um the situation in ah north korea all of a sudden these people decide that um 

486.59 494.84 A: go ahead and start up their nuclear program again and um a couple of times they've already fired missiles into um the sea of japan 

494.81 505.50 A: and it to me it seems like we're not doing very much about that we're just letting it go by and and ah you know i heard s- somewhere where we're thinking of pulling our troops out of um 

505.48 510.32 A: the d._m._c. zone over there and saying because they said that the south koreans have enough 

510.86 513.46 A: soldiers there to take care of it but [cough] 

514.21 516.61 A: that's another concern that i have with 

516.65 518.26 A: north korea 

518.43 520.54 A: all of a sudden you know they see [mn] 

520.94 522.48 A: they've taken then where 

522.74 533.89 B: well in all honestly i think north korea's being smart because i mean i well i i mean [laughter] trust me i'm not by far condoning what they're doing but i mean imagine 

522.89 523.71 A: oh 

533.98 539.65 B: they're watching our newscasters broadcast the fact that we're sending all these troops to iraq 

539.52 545.92 B: and you know ah the number of our forces and what we have there you know north korea decides you know what 

545.78 559.10 B: this would be a really a good time to kinda rattle our bones a little bit you know and they're right you know but what i think everybody underestimates is as much as our military has been cut back we still are 

559.25 567.45 B: we still are the main force of the world and if it takes us being in two places at one time you know i'm pretty sure we can do it 

567.57 570.76 A: (( yeah no i agree with you one hundred percent there we are um )) 

570.83 576.18 A: number one world power in in the world ah but 

576.22 578.17 A: i i'm just thinking you know 

578.43 581.03 A: we we have um likes of bin laden 

581.60 582.59 A: iraq 

582.83 589.76 A: north korea now you know who might be next to start saying hey you know they're letting their guard down now and hell we're going to start 

589.16 592.41 B: well see that's exactly why though i think that we need to be 

592.53 599.89 B: tougher and i think i think bush needs to stand by what he saying because if he backs off now if he says okay we'll give them
