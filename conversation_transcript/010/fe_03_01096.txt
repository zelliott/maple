0.00 0.57 A: (( [cough] )) 

0.92 2.14 B: hello 

1.40 3.00 A: ah hello 

2.72 3.72 B: hi 

3.83 5.54 B: i'm angela jones 

5.63 7.43 A: yes i'm may 

7.41 8.39 B: may 

8.01 9.18 A: yes 

8.54 10.47 B: okay it's nice to meet you 

10.62 12.14 A: and likewise [laughter] 

12.46 13.70 B: [laughter] [sigh] 

14.27 18.32 B: and what do you think would you leave the united states for a million dollars 

17.79 20.28 A: [noise] i don't think so [noise] 

19.65 20.35 B: (( uh-huh )) 

20.46 24.72 A: [laughter] i don't think so no 

20.95 22.24 B: [laughter] 

24.43 25.02 B: (( [mn] )) 

25.12 26.31 A: um 

26.59 29.58 A: so what do you want to know why wouldn't i why 

28.71 30.26 B: yeah why wouldn't you 

30.75 32.92 A: wouldn't i um well 

33.02 38.66 A: [lipsmack] um at my age it would be much too difficult to start over again 

38.70 47.04 A: and with the stipulation that i could never return i'd be leaving family behind and ah that would be like giving up my life 

46.81 48.03 B: mhm 

47.87 58.94 A: so um [sigh] no i i would not you know if there was a time limit of say five years [lipsmack] um that would be worth considering but for a lifetime forever 

59.18 65.13 A: ah no definitely not [sigh] within my realm of consideration at all 

65.06 66.26 B: mhm 

66.98 67.91 B: huh 

68.59 69.67 B: okay 

69.78 71.51 B: w- what would you 

72.00 81.01 B: what is most important to you about the united states what reason i mean besides your family and ah you said but are there other things about the united states that would make you 

81.16 83.53 B: feel that you wouldn't ever leave 

83.28 84.81 A: [lipsmack] um 

86.04 92.00 A: [lipsmack] i really think that we have the best healthcare delivery system in the world 

92.33 102.23 A: um [lipsmack] and i do have medical issues that require not necessarily ongoing treatment that is crucial but ongoing checks 

102.51 105.56 A: and if it did become a crucial situation 

105.66 110.69 A: i um i don't think i could get the quality of care elsewhere 

110.24 111.40 B: mhm 

110.74 112.28 A: that i could here 

111.83 113.00 B: mhm 

113.63 125.63 A: um so that is very important to me now if the question was would i go and live in mexico the answer would be different or canada because you know i could have easy access 

125.67 127.67 A: to the united states but 

125.77 126.81 B: mhm 

127.69 128.57 A: (( um )) 

128.86 134.43 A: no the thought of going overseas and i have lived overseas so it's not a foreign idea to me 

134.52 135.46 A: um 

135.61 139.82 A: and it's it's wonderful to live in a country other than the united states 

139.59 140.59 B: mhm 

139.92 142.85 A: but the forever piece makes it an easy no 

142.73 145.05 B: mhm mhm 

145.26 152.80 B: [sigh] all right well i think i would agree with most of what you said too my i wouldn't i don't think i would leave either um 

151.96 152.73 A: [laughter] 

152.74 156.94 B: may for different reasons um par- partially because of my family i have a 

156.87 161.63 B: um a my husband and i have an eleven month old little girl 

161.23 162.65 A: (( oh oh yes )) 

161.50 175.48 B: and that would be that would be very scary for me being far far away from family to that could because i depend on my family a lot to help us with with our daughter and um so i i think 

172.04 173.15 A: sure 

175.66 179.43 B: i think that i would have to say no also that 

179.73 182.74 B: i i mean i wouldn't e- i don't think i would even consider it for 

182.78 196.50 B: a for a time period because i've never been overseas so i it's kind of fear of the unknown um [laughter] i've never i've never i've been to mexico but nowhere else so 

184.72 185.57 A: (( mhm mm )) 

189.96 191.00 A: okay 

191.75 192.64 A: sure 

194.99 197.62 A: okay yeah yeah all 

196.77 197.67 B: um 

197.95 201.26 B: um so that i mean i must admit it was now 

201.57 215.20 B: like you said mexico or canada having a close proximity to the united states might be a little bit different and um i do i have had a a very close friend who lives in canada and he ah 

207.36 208.31 A: (( right right )) 

215.39 219.24 B: had had talked to me a lot about their medical care and 

218.88 219.87 A: mhm 

219.18 233.32 B: in canada and how you know they don't they don't it's not as expensive to get medical care as it is in the united states it's it's more it's kind of rationed almost i mean everybody gets medical care but you don't so much get to choose 

225.76 226.79 A: right 

229.76 230.61 A: yeah 

233.28 241.90 B: ah your doctors and and the type of care that you get but everyone does get care whether they're rich or poor which i like that idea 

236.48 237.63 A: right 

239.86 241.06 A: exactly 

241.44 245.02 A: yeah yeah well they're more into a socialized medicine situation 

242.00 243.11 B: but 

244.52 245.49 B: right 

245.18 257.44 A: and um certainly i i hope that at some t- point in the near future we can change our [sigh] medical system so that more people can have um quality healthcare insurance [lipsmack] 

249.47 252.18 B: (( mhm )) 

256.88 258.06 B: mhm 

257.91 260.97 A: because that's a huge issue in this country 

260.37 261.94 B: yes it is 

261.28 263.09 A: just a huge issue 

262.32 266.71 B: and it's probably going to continue to be a huge issue for a long time 

266.10 267.86 A: right i think so 

267.48 268.59 B: mhm 

268.62 269.76 B: mhm 

269.15 270.02 A: (( yes )) 

270.03 273.98 A: and i'm very fortunate i have excellent healthcare coverage and i don't 

274.18 279.46 A: what i would do without it because i have used it and i have needed it 

275.56 277.11 B: mhm 

277.83 280.14 B: mhm mhm 

280.08 281.00 A: so 

281.20 292.09 B: yes and that freedom to choose your your doctors and and the type of care that you want is is definitely something that's important 

285.01 286.05 A: (( yes that's right )) 

291.55 292.96 A: that is a biggie yeah yes 

292.61 293.57 B: so 

293.97 297.32 B: yeah well and i think also that i mean 

297.62 298.19 B: (( um )) 

298.20 310.98 B: i just feel safe in the united states i mean i know after the events of the last couple of years that i mean i haven't felt as safe as the- i have in the past but but i i i still feel like that the 

311.75 315.44 B: the united states is probably the safest place in the world to live 

314.67 315.81 A: mhm 

315.54 316.51 B: so 

316.86 317.75 B: i mean 

318.68 319.83 A: right 

319.85 322.48 A: right an- and you know there is no 

322.80 325.59 A: safe or perfect place anymore 

325.07 326.99 B: (( mhm )) 

325.88 327.07 A: and um 

327.61 337.02 A: [lipsmack] you know you think you know alot about other countries but i don't really think you do until you are there and find out first hand 

337.25 339.95 A: um have you seen the movie catch me if you can 

339.59 341.17 B: no i haven't 

340.60 348.13 A: well it's an excellent movie it's very entertaining and it's based on a true story a man named frank abergnail 

347.88 348.96 B: mhm 

348.33 352.88 A: and he wrote a book on it on ah the whole thing do you know what it's about 

349.96 351.08 B: mhm 

352.49 353.95 B: (( uh-uh no )) 

353.56 354.72 A: okay it's 

354.13 356.12 B: is it playing in theaters now 

355.87 357.14 A: yes it is 

356.53 360.11 B: okay we don't get to the movies very often with a baby [laughter] 

359.27 363.72 A: no i'm sure you don't [laughter] i can understand that 

360.44 362.58 B: [laughter] 

362.73 364.20 B: [laughter] 

364.29 377.39 A: um but anyway it's about a young man who at the age of sixteen became a scam artist and he would pass bad checks and he did absolutely preposterous things he passed himself off as a 

369.98 370.82 B: (( hm )) 

377.38 381.20 A: [lipsmack] ah trans or one of the big airlines 

381.34 383.42 A: ah companies as a pilot 

383.12 384.31 B: mhm 

383.68 394.25 A: and he passed himself off as a doctor he passed himself off as an attorney but the biggest thing that landed him in jail and gave him a prison sentence was his um financial 

394.96 397.63 A: um what should i say his financial 

397.96 400.56 A: ah [laughter] crimes 

400.17 401.40 B: mhm 

400.77 408.22 A: that's what they were crimes he just passed a ton of bad checks but anyway he the law caught up with him when he was in france 

404.27 405.13 B: mhm 

408.06 409.13 B: mhm 

408.37 417.21 A: and he was put into a french prison and this was as recent as nineteen seventy four and um he was in this french prison for six months 

417.24 430.47 A: and had absolutely subsistence food it was like bread thin watery soup he had no toilet facilities um literally he had to sleep in his own um feces and urine 

430.17 431.15 B: mm 

430.65 440.52 A: and when he came out of there he was very very ill i mean close to death but i guess my point is nobody hears about that 

436.05 437.10 B: mhm 

439.88 441.24 B: mhm 

440.61 446.73 A: and if that happened as recently as nineteen seventy four it probably is still going on 

444.41 445.40 B: mhm 

446.37 447.70 B: probably 

447.27 448.16 A: yeah 

447.73 448.92 B: mhm 

448.62 450.93 A: so i don't know anyway 

450.07 451.41 B: mhm 

451.03 456.07 A: it's just one of those things and it's not important but i know that i'm supposed to keep talking so 

455.72 457.17 B: (( [laughter] )) 

456.26 458.21 A: i'm talking [laughter] 

457.46 467.46 B: i know it's hard [laughter] [laughter] well [mn] that's that movie that you just ex- the movie that you talked about um 

458.84 460.47 A: [laughter] 

467.57 476.31 B: my parents were out out of the country in mexico a- about oh a year and a half ago and 

476.45 487.95 B: my m- my mother got her i._d. and her wallet stolen on the airplane on the way to mexico on vacation so she had no i._d. to get back on the plane to get out of mexico 

482.83 484.36 A: (( oh no oh no )) 

487.70 489.35 A: (( oh yeah oh )) 

487.92 501.03 B: and so they spent um oh a a big part of their vacation trying to to find out how to get you know her some i._d. so she could g- be able to leave leave mexico to come back into the united states 

495.95 496.76 A: oh 

500.93 508.28 B: and they ca- came in in all this process of trying to y- talk to the authorities and stuff in mexico 

508.11 512.77 B: they learned ah they met a couple that were on their honeymoon and the couple had been 

512.57 523.54 B: put in jail because th- they had rented a car and apparently the husband had made a an illegal u. turn and the police had thrown him in jail for a u. turn 

523.41 537.20 B: and they had told him they would let him out if he gave them all their cash and his wife's wedding ring and they'd just gotten married so he swallowed her wedding ring in order to keep from having it taken by the police 

523.63 524.78 A: oh 

532.93 534.04 A: oh 

536.57 538.51 A: oh no 

537.81 551.59 B: so i mean i don't know a- the i don't know what ended up happening to him but my parents had you know that was when they came back and told me that story that made me so thankful for the united states and for the way you know i mean you can you can trust most of the 

547.67 548.64 A: yeah 

551.48 558.00 B: a- authorities here and i mean yes there are some that you can't but o- on the whole you can 

552.93 553.80 A: right 

557.55 558.96 A: on the whole you w- 

558.06 566.86 B: you know and so it that [laughter] that just made me realize how fortunate we are in our country that you know 

561.27 562.21 A: (( yeah wow )) 

565.44 566.30 A: (( yes yes )) 

566.90 568.17 B: you can
