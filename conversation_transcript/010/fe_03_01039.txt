18.36 21.29 A: so the topic is terrorism huh 

21.54 26.12 B: yeah i guess how how how how do we react or how will people react in 

26.57 27.95 B: and vice versa 

28.37 30.17 A: yeah okay so you first 

30.87 31.44 B: um 

31.76 32.51 B: geez i 

33.57 35.05 B: personally i think that 

35.79 36.95 B: i think a lot of people are 

37.34 40.16 B: pretty angry about what had happened so far 

40.51 41.09 B: uh 

41.82 42.75 B: know i'm a little bit 

43.07 44.29 B: shook up about it 

44.44 46.38 B: i don't know what to expect i have a lot of 

46.96 48.09 B: family members that are 

48.43 50.56 B: personally involved now militarily 

50.98 52.72 B: um not happy about that 

53.87 54.51 B: um 

55.32 57.67 B: how i would react uh 

58.33 60.09 B: well i live in an area that's 

61.09 63.19 B: could be compromised i suppose 

63.30 65.71 B: if if anything were to ever get to that scale 

66.21 66.92 B: so 

67.32 67.78 B: my 

67.89 68.69 B: i guess i'm 

69.29 71.22 B: i'm pretty concerned about it 

71.88 73.45 B: uh i don't know that i'm 

73.81 75.67 B: to the point where i would go to 

76.26 76.68 B: you know 

76.93 77.47 B: uh 

77.89 81.07 B: plastic and duct tape or whatever around my house but 

81.71 85.12 B: um i mean i work for a water department and 

85.35 85.85 B: uh 

86.56 87.03 B: (( )) 

87.19 88.03 B: my my 

88.53 94.69 B: like we've put put on heightened alert as far as the safety of water goes as far as terrorism is concerned 

95.27 95.89 B: um 

96.47 97.76 B: but i don't think we're going 

98.11 103.19 B: quite that far yet when we're taking a lot of drastic measures to make sure things are 

103.79 104.27 B: you know 

105.59 108.20 B: as they should be which is probably how they 

108.45 109.75 B: should have been all along 

110.47 110.85 B: but 

111.21 112.25 B: hm i 

112.86 116.81 B: i don't know i'm not quite sure how do how'd i react um 

117.50 118.35 B: i guess if 

119.33 125.91 B: uh if something happened to any of my family members as a result i think i'd probably feel quite a bit quite a bit more 

126.10 128.13 B: then i do already but 

127.93 128.38 A: right 

128.67 132.39 B: uh it's something that 

133.65 135.21 B: the way i feel about it is 

135.70 137.78 B: i think we're dealing with some people that 

141.97 152.22 B: i i actually i take that back i don't think it's the general populace that feels that way i think it's probably the the upper echelon and i think probably it's more of a power 

153.12 153.55 B: uh 

153.72 154.58 B: a power 

154.70 155.84 B: struggle for them 

155.95 158.99 B: then it is anything else but they seem to be willing to 

159.54 160.51 B: sacrifice 

160.64 161.46 B: quite a bit 

162.90 165.69 B: you know other than their own you know to 

166.00 167.18 B: to see it through 

167.78 173.41 B: and that kind of bothers me because i guess they brai- (( )) kind of brainwashing people into 

174.05 175.10 B: doing things that are 

176.09 176.80 B: crazy 

177.02 178.17 B: you know my opinion 

179.37 180.25 B: but uh 

180.75 181.93 B: you know it it's 

182.16 185.27 B: for my my standpoint i really haven't (( )) you know 

185.88 188.78 B: other than fact that i you know i'm an american and all that and 

189.39 190.87 B: you know nine eleven was uh 

191.16 192.22 B: that was huge 

192.45 194.60 B: absolutely huge i cannot imagine 

195.30 197.34 B: anything like that i mean i come from 

197.59 199.45 B: forty miles outside of new york city 

200.21 201.09 B: and i know 

201.50 202.03 B: you know 

202.13 203.10 B: exactly 

203.24 205.77 B: i've been to the world trade centers many times and 

206.50 212.55 B: uh i i know that area very well and i cannot imagine what these people have gone through 

213.45 214.29 B: and 

215.06 217.02 B: what could possibly happen again 

218.10 218.70 B: and 

219.19 221.52 B: seems to me that our vulnerability is 

221.73 222.79 B: is too apparent 

223.02 224.01 B: i i think that 

224.83 225.24 B: you know 

225.66 227.08 B: we seem to think that 

227.92 228.61 B: we're 

228.86 229.97 B: you know this great 

230.13 232.57 B: powerful nation well that's great but 

233.09 241.07 B: as free as we are i think that's how vulnerable we are i mean there's a lot of countries that have been going through these types of things i think for 

241.24 242.81 B: a lot longer than i've been around 

243.50 244.22 B: and 

244.67 247.41 B: uh to them they take it very seriously 

248.31 250.13 B: uh in that uh uh 

250.93 253.00 B: it seems to me like we're we're like the 

253.22 254.50 B: number one target 

255.14 256.31 B: simply because of our 

256.68 262.03 B: quote unquote innocence i don't know if i can say that anymore as a result of what's happened 

262.48 264.45 B: and what continues to happen but 

265.04 265.62 B: uh 

266.11 268.60 B: i i i'm i am concerned there's no question 

271.79 274.39 A: well i think i pretty much agree with you on that part um 

278.39 279.13 B: oh boy 

283.81 287.33 A: the fear that ran through the country at the whole point as far as 

287.75 292.25 A: you know well what's going to happen now because the first plane that you know when it 

307.30 310.90 A: and um i went from working out of the airport because i travel 

311.26 314.82 A: industry i'm a travel agent and that 

313.09 313.51 B: uh huh 

315.45 324.13 A: it's a concern that's expressed there are a lot of the clients that come in it's what happens you know if i'm overseas and you know so we have to deal with 

324.24 330.19 A: that part not so much the military part but the concerns of the you know the the 

327.90 329.14 B: sure sure 

337.77 339.85 A: you know make sure you call and re-confirm your flight 

339.94 351.86 A: but um here's your u._s. embassy you know here's the name of the consulate there and you know that type of information as well um and there's a lot of people that are buying insurance which is so funny that 

354.23 354.90 A: um 

355.26 356.18 A: adapting 

356.35 357.12 A: because 

357.49 365.35 A: we're we offer most of the (( )) travel agencies offer insurance that now protects you in acts of terrorism which you know like 

364.83 365.38 B: wow 

369.66 371.18 B: mhm exactly 

376.24 376.68 A: um 

376.85 380.90 A: in this area and i don't live in a big populated city but um 

381.68 384.79 A: and the people that do travel they consider you know they consider 

387.43 388.38 B: absolutely 

395.59 396.97 A: (( )) throughout the whole 

397.37 398.09 A: um 

398.19 400.32 A: town so it's more of a 

400.89 402.38 A: not so much 

402.51 414.38 A: what would happen but how would we deal with it that type of attitude you know and they there's a lot of people with the duct tapes and plastic on the windows that type of thing um you know a lot of people stocking up but i don't know if it was 

406.44 407.65 B: sure sure 

411.07 411.51 B: yeah 

414.83 416.20 A: that necessarily 

416.89 420.30 A: you know because they're panicking or just because they want to be prepared 

421.17 421.69 B: sure 

421.46 421.94 A: um 

422.16 423.53 A: (( )) a family though 

422.39 423.49 B: i i can relate 

423.96 424.92 A: sure go ahead 

424.19 425.12 B: yeah i mean i i 

425.49 427.03 B: i came from a small town 

427.13 433.05 B: before i moved to where i am now and i i can relate to to what you're saying very much there's no question 

433.49 433.90 A: uh huh 

433.56 436.54 B: i mean it it was really more of a patriotic and a 

436.92 438.17 B: you know everybody 

438.48 440.20 B: watches out for everyone else 

441.05 441.59 B: and 

442.17 442.85 B: but still 

443.58 447.88 B: what are you doing there were times where you would run off on the tangents of 

448.14 453.28 B: you know from one extreme to the other and i'm not sure if that was really a big thing or not either 

453.43 453.90 A: right 

453.68 455.83 B: but coming from a small town 

456.17 459.69 B: as you say i mean i i can certainly relate to that 

461.63 463.27 A: so do you think as far as 

463.38 467.28 A: say terrorism part goes that the president is reacting correctly 

475.56 476.21 A: that that's a 

476.69 479.79 A: concern as far as americans or do you think that he's doing the right thing 

479.89 481.16 B: i i'm i'm 

481.60 484.72 B: i'm a little bit dis- disheartened by 

485.13 487.14 B: a lot of the reaction that i get from 

487.36 488.78 B: people and i guess it's probably 

489.61 490.44 B: parents 

490.72 493.91 B: people who have (( )) children who would be sent over 

494.65 499.34 B: uh obviously i think a lot of them they don't necessarily agree i don't know 

499.90 502.24 B: where or exactly why 

502.49 503.84 B: where they're standing but 

504.51 507.11 B: uh i'm i'm not old enough to to to 

507.23 509.59 B: to make that type of a decision myself and i'm 

509.76 510.91 B: thanking god that i'm 

511.03 512.14 B: (( )) 

512.48 513.27 B: (( )) 

514.26 517.32 B: (( )) uh you know things the way things are going 

517.68 518.37 B: but um 

519.25 520.70 B: i think that um 

520.90 522.38 B: he's doing the right thing
