0.00 1.59 B: hello [noise] 

0.60 4.92 A: hi [laughter] i'm lori 

2.12 3.84 B: hi my name's kathy [noise] 

4.40 6.92 B: hi lori this is my first call 

6.40 8.92 A: yeah it's mine too [laughter] 

7.45 15.18 B: yeah so i don't know quite how we're supposed to do this so they said we're supposed to talk about how we draw the line between bad taste comedy and and ah comedy that's funny 

14.84 17.04 A: acceptable yeah 

16.32 20.23 B: oh i'm afraid i draw it very far to the bad taste area [laughter] [mn] 

19.46 22.66 A: [laughter] um 

23.79 26.10 A: well i'm not sure either 

26.24 27.33 A: um 

27.80 37.33 A: i guess i would draw the line um you know when it comes to i guess the appoint- to the point of being offensive 

36.93 37.87 B: uh-huh 

37.44 48.32 A: um i guess you know either to myself or um you know anybody even anybody that i know i guess you know that i wouldn't think it was funny any longer 

47.76 50.62 B: yeah i guess to me it depends on if i'm 

50.61 63.37 B: if there's a person around that's going to get offended because there's some jokes that are really very very tasteless and i would never say them around anybody else but my husband and i might say them to each other and laugh and just kind of be like okay 

53.06 54.38 A: right 

63.33 72.92 B: don't tell anybody i said that you know and laugh about it and we have some pretty some very tasteless tasteless things we think are funny but i would not um anything that was ah 

64.56 66.27 A: right right 

73.03 80.90 B: that was um [mn] you know tasteless and was also going to maybe hurt somebody's feelings and at the same time there was someone around who could potentially hear it 

80.42 81.73 A: right 

81.07 82.09 B: you know 

83.36 90.95 A: yeah i guess it it definitely depends on um you know the situation and and where you're at that is that is true 

89.20 90.34 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

91.00 101.28 B: yeah because if it's i mean like if it's just us and there's nobody around but us then and we make a joke at someone else's expense or whatever i mean there's nobody in my opinion there's nobody to be offended by it 

101.12 109.73 B: so i don't really count it as as being some of it some of the same jokes that would be in poor taste if um like someone said them at work or if someone said them at ah 

108.03 109.31 A: right 

109.56 118.37 B: you know in a mixed group or or with strangers or whatever are jokes that i might actually have thought were funny if it was just us just kinda [noise] laughing at home 

119.60 120.58 B: (( so )) 

121.33 126.15 B: so i guess that's where i would draw the line but like i said i'm kind of i'm kind of tasteless we like 

126.33 130.66 B: like i don't know we like monty python stuff and we like er [mn] 

130.75 132.62 B: ah what else do we like 

132.65 134.00 B: what else do we like 

133.29 136.96 A: (( [noise] [laughter] yeah comedy is )) 

134.30 135.52 B: [laughter] the 

136.16 137.60 B: pressure of performing 

137.54 141.02 A: is not a big thing with [laughter] with me 

140.28 146.83 B: yeah it is with us really i mean we we we seek out humor but it just i think it's it's this um 

146.99 152.98 B: on the spot on the spot kind of ah performance anxiety trying to think of trying to think of things 

151.94 153.69 A: right right 

152.89 167.70 B: um there's a comedian i don't know if you've heard of him named carlos moncia and ah and a lot of people think that he's just awful and we think he's hilarious [laughter] you know we've gone to go see him a couple of times and and ah and we'll go see him intentionally and he's and he is ah 

156.14 157.25 A: yes 

160.43 162.07 A: [laughter] 

167.58 174.93 B: really kind of um [lipsmack] he's really kind of a lot of his stuff is kinda tasteless and and ah you might think even ah 

174.81 184.57 B: you know inappropriate if anybody in the audience was not hispanic and i i'm not but my husband is but i can see the humor in it anyway you know it's like i take it in the the 

181.15 182.97 A: right right 

184.54 188.25 B: the venue that it's intended to be like if you watch um 

188.08 200.00 B: like i guess if you watch some of the black comic- comics on ah like the black networks and ah the jokes that they're making are really at the expense of of white people and i'll still laugh because i mean the joke is funny but 

197.54 198.74 A: right 

200.25 207.54 B: i'm not ah you know i'm offended but and then there's other things that are you know that are offensive you know if someone makes a 

202.32 203.52 A: yeah 

207.71 210.59 B: a joke about somebody that's a ah a 

210.73 217.34 B: r- ethnic or racial group or whatever that's in my family or my friends or whatever and they make it and you think that perhaps they believe it 

217.04 229.33 A: right right well that's true because i used to work in a a male dominant um career field and you know so obviously i heard you know a lot of jokes that were 

218.28 219.47 B: you know that's 

222.25 222.79 B: (( ah )) 

229.43 233.36 A: um you know i guess maybe derogatory towards females 

232.66 233.96 B: yeah 

233.31 246.13 A: but i wasn't really offended by it because you know i figured you know i chose to be in that career field and you know i wasn't gonna expect everybody around me you know to conform you know just 

245.15 246.34 B: right 

246.03 252.72 A: to make me more comfortable or you know make me happy and so you know it was my choice kind of a thing so 

249.11 250.36 B: yeah 

252.87 258.24 A: um you know if it was directed at me yes maybe i would have found it offensive but you know 

256.93 268.09 B: yeah see i'm kinda different on that because if i was in a group of women and they were telling women jokes dumb blonde jokes or whatever i would probably be more likely to think it was funny than if i was in a group of men that were doing it 

267.42 268.96 A: right right 

268.30 274.06 B: you know even if it was my work and and ah and there's so there's there's jokes that that people can make that from 

273.90 281.90 B: depends on who it comes from like for instance i just went back to work in december after having a baby and i'm pumping milk at at at work 

280.66 281.63 A: uh-huh 

281.71 293.46 B: and my boss who i don't like who doesn't like me made a comment one day about they left the ah coffee creamer out and it had spoilt and she was like well you know if we need to get milk we know where to get it we can just go get some from kathy 

293.00 294.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

293.59 307.12 B: and depending on who said that i might have either think thought it was just kind of dumb but innocuous or i might have thought it was you know slightly funny but coming from my boss who i know doesn't like me very much and who i know was very unhappy with me even having a baby she told me i wasn't ah 

300.16 301.23 A: right 

307.53 316.75 B: sufficiently dedicated to my job um [lipsmack] that i knew coming from her that it was not meant very lighthearted at all and so it i didn't i didn't feel like a joke to me 

314.04 315.45 A: right 

316.29 317.54 A: yeah 

316.83 325.25 B: you know it made me mad but you know the same ah the same joke from somebody else might you know i just might have just taken it like oh yeah ha ha you know 

324.03 325.59 A: right right 

325.26 329.82 B: but then of course there's lots of ah there's lots of humor that ah 

329.96 331.06 B: that we 

331.15 336.56 B: um you know look at and listen to like i said that's kind of that's kind of tacky and ah i'm 

336.80 341.01 B: not sure we'd want to share it outside of ah outside of our house 

338.46 340.22 A: [laughter] 

340.26 341.62 A: yeah 

340.93 347.76 B: you know we're trying to decide with our daughter you know we don't we- definitely there's some jokes that we've told each other since she's been born that's been like you know 

347.67 361.27 B: as soon as she starts to get old enough to to have some clue which is going to be a lot faster than we think it is you know we we're going to have to stop doing that because we don't want her to um to pick it up and think it's funny when she's too little to to make that distinction of 

349.63 351.89 A: comprehend yeah 

352.51 354.08 A: [laughter] 

360.66 361.81 A: right 

362.54 363.96 B: you know so 

364.85 368.60 B: so anyway this is a an interesting little project [laughter] 

368.11 375.09 A: yeah it is all right [laughter] you know it's hard to talk on one topic [noise] for a continuous ten minutes [laughter] 

373.77 382.81 B: yeah it is the thing that i read said we're supposed to talk about it for sure for eight of our ten minutes so that's good so we at least get a two minute ah interjecting other comments kind of a thing in there 

381.53 383.23 A: [laughter] 

383.06 385.36 B: you know so how did you find out about it 

385.14 388.42 A: um o- on ah is it money and shopping 

388.23 389.19 B: (( oh )) 

389.09 390.48 A: through the internet 

389.99 403.79 B: oh yeah i found out about it because i'm on an online forum and one of the one of my friends on the forum posted a link and said ooh this is what we had talked about linguistic differences about how from all over the world about you know how do you pronounce this how do you pronounce that other times and so she posted it 

403.50 404.86 A: (( oh okay )) 

403.88 414.62 B: and so i came on it and ah and yeah so that's another thing is is that we get we get real um we get we get real silly on that on that online forum sometimes and we make jokes and and ah 

414.60 426.44 B: we try not to make any jokes that that would be you know derogatory to any group so we generally don't but we might get real silly that if somebody just happened to come across us and read you know se- a sequence of posts 

426.26 427.42 A: right 

426.72 430.09 B: you know there might be someone thinking what is the matter with these people 

428.94 430.70 A: [laughter] 

430.14 434.13 B: you know that's not funny you know we have a couple of threads where we pick on 

434.31 435.96 B: groups not um 

436.04 440.11 B: like ethnic groups but like oh we've got a thread about um 

440.00 450.02 B: about brides that are just over the top you know bridezilla type you know and we'll say you know horrible things about somebody who's bridezilling this or we've got another thread about baby names that 

442.76 443.81 A: right 

449.90 455.79 B: and we'll you know people will post names from their their er newspaper you know and er 

455.76 467.63 B: talk and we'll say oh my god you know how can they name a kid that and we'll make up make jokes with the with the names but if someone we knew were to ever say this is what i'm naming my baby i mean we would never go you know make the same kind of joke 

460.62 461.70 A: yeah 

465.68 466.86 A: right 

467.98 476.37 B: so i guess with with drawing the line i guess it has to be ah it's so so circumstantial and [noise] case by case that 

473.66 474.88 A: it is 

476.43 480.16 B: but you know you never can tell you know and then sometimes its just 

480.44 488.47 B: um it depends on my mood too because sometimes things just strike me as much for funny depending on what mood i'm in or much less funny you know ooh 

486.88 487.92 A: yeah 

488.72 489.99 B: that's offensive 

490.07 493.54 A: yeah if you're in a bad mood not much at all is funny 

492.42 499.63 B: right it's all offensive don't make jokes at me how dare you how dare you criticize bridezillas you know they might they have feelings too 

494.10 495.77 A: (( [laughter] )) 

497.47 502.05 A: [laughter] don't even talk [laughter] right now 

501.11 502.63 B: yeah so 

502.83 504.96 B: (( but ah but anyway )) 

504.91 510.94 A: well some topics are definitely gonna be easier than others and this one was a bit tough for me [laughter] [noise] 

509.49 517.83 B: yeah it was kinda tough i one of my friends that that um logged on yesterday her topic was terrorism and she's very um 

517.86 528.02 B: on the liberal side and the person that she was talking to was very on the the right wing republican side and she said it was very interesting because she had to sit there talking to a complete stranger like we're doing 

522.86 523.89 A: uh-huh 

528.05 542.65 B: and be very calm and not let the fact that the things that this person was saying really pu- push her buttons and ah have a rational conversation for ten minutes with a stranger on a topic that was very um controversial so at at least at least our first one started out kind of less ah 

533.13 534.63 A: right 

539.61 540.63 A: yeah 

542.16 543.65 A: [laughter] 

543.00 544.50 B: less controversial 

545.32 546.52 A: ah yeah 

545.55 549.33 B: so are they sup- do they supposed to like buzz us or something at ten minutes or 

548.56 552.34 A: no i don't i'm sure it will prob- it will probably let us know 

552.04 553.56 B: that's good 

552.84 555.61 A: when the end of the ten minutes is over 

555.08 558.16 B: because i have no idea i didn't look at the clock when the phone rang so 

557.58 563.21 A: i didn't either i was downstairs getting ready to set up a car track with my boys [laughter] 

559.43 560.46 B: yeah 

561.99 564.73 B: yeah so where do you live 

564.36 566.20 A: i'm in colorado springs 

565.58 568.35 B: oh okay my sister in law lives nearby there 

567.98 569.21 A: oh does she 

568.54 570.13 B: yeah we're in austin 

569.71 571.01 A: okay 

570.89 572.16 B: yeah so 

572.21 578.82 B: it's kinda i guess they're trying to see about how our our different pronunciations and linguistical 

578.99 589.69 B: linguistic type stuff this is a linguistics study so they're trying real not to make sure that i didn't ah talk in a way different than i normally would [laughter] you know mess up their mess up their report because i 

585.59 587.19 A: [laughter] 

589.83 592.69 B: started picking up other accents or something i don't know 

592.87 599.89 A: well it's it's weird because i lived in oklahoma for ten years and um and people always asked me you know where i'm from 

596.16 597.20 B: yeah 

599.53 599.89 B: (( y- ))
