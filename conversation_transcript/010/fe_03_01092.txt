12.65 14.78 B: now myself i think i wouldn't be i'd take the money 

15.58 16.61 A: you would take the money 

16.76 17.33 B: yep 

18.01 18.77 A: where would you go 

19.56 25.59 B: man there's so many possibilities probably brazil or maybe europe or maybe africa it's like 

25.85 28.35 B: i mean really i could go around the world buy a boat i don't know 

28.70 38.99 A: well it would be tempting i w- i w- i think i'd want to go but a million dollars wouldn't get you very far i have family and i wouldn't want to leave my family so i don't think i would to do it 

29.44 29.85 B: (( )) 

39.80 41.64 B: hm that makes sense that makes sense 

42.17 45.31 B: but (( )) they did say never return that is true but then again 

44.71 45.24 A: (( )) 

45.80 53.33 B: if um like say if someone was savvy with their business sense you know they could take that money and you know try to make a empire and bring their f- uh family with them 

53.69 57.07 A: yeah but what about family members that wouldn't leave that you couldn't see 

58.09 58.68 B: that's true 

58.10 59.63 A: or that were sick or something 

60.52 67.23 B: that's true i guess in a way it depends on a person's financial situation because if they're already comfortable now then it's like well a million dollars is 

67.35 68.17 B: not really 

68.44 70.13 B: as much as it use to be you know 

69.59 72.01 A: no a million dollars would be great but 

72.21 75.99 A: uh i'm i'm a big family person so i know that 

76.34 81.38 A: i would never be able to leave and not come back because i i'd always want to be here for my family so 

82.69 83.40 B: that makes sense 

83.83 85.73 B: do you have any family members you think would take the offer 

86.13 91.69 A: oh y- absolutely i i mo- most of them would leave me in a heartbeat 

92.23 92.63 B: hm 

93.34 100.03 B: but see then again i think because it's a hypothetical situation we're just thinking about it you know but if it was actually in front of us i don't know you know 

100.17 100.74 A: yeah 

101.19 103.89 A: that's a lot of money and you could do a lot of good with it 

104.77 106.79 A: but like say i'm i'm 

104.91 105.54 B: that's true 

107.59 109.70 A: i would need to be here for my family so 

111.23 112.31 A: i wouldn't take the money 

111.28 111.78 B: hm 

112.71 113.89 A: now my son 

114.08 117.39 A: he he wouldn't care if he ever saw me again he'd he'd go 

117.98 125.77 B: but really if you think about it but how because it said you could never return but there's ways to get in the country where how could they know you did you returned you know 

126.79 127.63 A: well that's true 

127.89 130.01 A: yeah if you c- if you could work it out but 

130.63 131.48 B: hm go get 

130.78 132.73 A: i'm not real good at sneaking 

132.82 138.17 B: well say i could go and get like facial reconstructive surgery and come back and be like what i'm not i'm not who you think i am what no 

138.50 139.30 B: someone else 

139.80 140.86 B: for real 

141.07 142.65 A: that's true 

142.90 143.94 A: where are you 

143.13 143.83 B: (( )) 

144.21 145.69 A: where are you at now james

150.33 152.45 A: okay i'm i'm in ashville north carolina 

153.05 156.02 B: oh okay okay because i i mean did you see this like this ad in the newspaper 

156.41 156.90 A: uh-huh 

157.41 161.63 B: yeah i saw i was like this is a good idea i saw it in (( creative loafer )) and i was like yeah i think i'll do that 

162.76 164.86 B: it is interesting they got some pretty good good questions 

165.23 165.76 A: mhm 

166.15 168.13 B: you know (( it's a )) decent topic for conversation 

169.66 171.77 B: i definitely think i'd leave though 

171.65 174.57 A: yeah i i'd i think ah i think 

175.42 179.53 A: you know probably seventy five percent of the population would 

179.71 180.60 A: take and go 

180.96 182.28 A: but i just i c- 

181.16 181.95 B: you think that much 

182.38 186.23 A: well maybe not but the people i know probably would 

186.36 189.11 A: you know seventy five percent of the people i know probably would take it 

190.09 192.34 B: yeah i'd say probably about ninety percent of the people i know 

193.16 195.25 B: well maybe a little less but somewhere around there 

195.48 195.94 A: yeah 

196.83 199.12 A: but (( )) it's a hard question 

197.15 197.49 B: i'm (( )) 

199.79 208.76 B: yeah i know a lot of our family members and some of my friends too they'd be like man (( )) never see you'll again but bye bye you know (( like it was )) nice knowing you 

208.95 213.16 B: really but the other part of the question they asked they said um 

213.41 216.81 B: what was it about america that you wouldn't miss is there anything that you wouldn't miss if you could leave 

215.56 215.95 A: right 

217.28 219.65 A: uh if i left i wouldn't miss 

220.71 223.68 A: the dirty politics i wouldn't miss taxes 

224.24 225.13 B: hm 

224.48 225.04 A: um 

226.03 227.23 A: but i would miss 

228.21 230.73 A: the the change in seasons uh 

231.20 233.55 A: and and being able to speak when you want to speak 

234.08 234.74 B: yeah 

234.77 237.28 A: and go where you want to go and do what you want to do 

236.98 243.68 B: huh yeah i think i i would definitely miss my family and i'd miss like 

238.00 239.21 A: and definitely the family 

243.99 246.61 B: of course the freedom of speech and also in a way 

247.15 248.94 B: the capitalism because you know (( it's )) 

249.40 255.43 B: it's easier (( to look at )) the um cost of living or how should i say 

256.17 258.50 B: the ability to make money here is better than 

258.83 267.35 B: a lot of other places because i met a lot of people from different countries different parts of the world and they come here with the specific purpose of making money because they're like in my country i might work you know 

267.50 270.83 B: all month for thirty days and here i make that in a day i'm like okay 

271.25 276.06 A: yeah yeah that's true that's true tha- th- there's a lot to miss about this country 

271.56 272.26 B: makes sense 

276.16 278.78 A: actually there's a really not a whole lot 

279.08 285.05 A: to not like uh being in north carolina we're taxed about forty times so 

284.15 285.06 B: right 

285.27 288.06 A: you know i i i wouldn't miss that at all 

288.26 288.75 A: um 

288.99 292.38 A: but there are (( )) countries that have even greater taxes than we do 

292.78 293.29 A: so 

293.00 293.36 B: hm 

294.24 295.44 A: uh i think great britain 

295.70 300.91 A: i mean their tax is like fifty percent i believe so i may be wrong on that yeah yeah 

299.04 300.15 B: fifty percent 

301.84 302.63 A: so 

301.86 302.92 B: whoa 

303.73 308.83 A: so there's l- you know a lot of countries that are taxed worse than we are and that's about the worse thing i think 

309.81 311.84 A: that uh for americans 

312.85 316.83 B: yeah definitely taxes do you know take a big chunk out of your pocket 

317.14 319.99 A: yeah they do (( but )) people need them you know 

320.40 324.05 A: i know that i know that i need my money a whole lot more than uh 

324.96 326.15 A: the state does or 

327.00 327.92 B: you know i mean 

327.11 327.99 A: the county 

328.43 332.04 B: yeah because you mentioned the dirty po- uh dirty politics earlier and i mean 

332.48 333.89 B: i see so many things 

334.12 340.45 B: like newspaper articles saying that okay this resear- uh research study they spend like fifteen million and there was 

340.58 344.26 B: it was inconclusive i'm like okay could have done something positive with that money or you know 

344.46 345.10 A: mhm 

345.33 345.99 A: yeah 

345.39 345.80 B: i don't know 

346.69 356.82 A: there there's all kind of things you know uh well like th- the toilet seats that cost two or three hundred dollars and the hammer that costs tw- you know that's ridiculous 

355.86 356.46 B: right 

358.25 360.10 A: and that's money that we could be using 

369.81 370.52 B: top of the line 

370.70 371.96 B: i'm like okay 

372.07 373.92 B: i can get it at walmart for three fifty come on 

373.67 377.48 A: exactly exactly 

377.67 383.14 A: there that that's that that really ticks me off when you see so much waste when there's so many 

383.29 385.58 A: american children doing without 

386.31 387.34 A: and that you know 

386.62 387.17 B: mhm 

387.49 388.66 A: that ticks me off 

389.45 394.67 B: another thing i think i would miss about america though is just the culture and like the entertainment i mean like 

395.00 395.91 B: america it's like 

396.04 398.93 B: hollywood in a way is is more powerful than washington 

399.07 399.73 B: you know what i mean 

399.34 399.71 A: yeah 

400.13 400.72 B: just as far as 

400.22 400.68 A: yeah 

400.82 403.25 B: and in a way it's bad but then again it's 

403.45 404.52 B: it's a lot of fun here 

405.27 405.65 B: i'm 

413.15 415.13 A: any kind of culture you know 

413.32 413.80 B: mhm 

415.34 415.81 B: mhm 

416.38 422.80 B: and there is so much of it i mean like if you like movies you can go to blockbuster you could watch movies back to back probably until you die and not see them all 

417.75 418.30 A: yeah 

422.43 424.52 A: yeah yeah that's true 

424.71 432.77 B: you know and the same with music you can just play i mean just so much you can do so many so much good food you know so many it's just like it's like 

430.75 431.44 A: uh-huh 

432.96 436.41 B: the most (( )) part of the world basically you can meet so many people here 

436.52 436.86 B: that 

437.13 440.73 B: in a way if if you know a lot of people you have a healthy social life 

440.90 446.86 B: yet you wouldn't really be sheltered like you could go almost anywhere in the world and know something about the place because you met so many people from there 

447.05 450.04 A: exactly (( )) we're almost like 

450.20 453.46 A: the united states almost represents the whole world 

453.87 454.35 B: you know 

454.69 456.53 A: yeah you know because 

456.87 459.65 A: you you can get a little bit of culture from everywhere 

460.43 464.54 A: so you're right about that too if if you can y- you pretty well 

467.16 470.12 A: know what you're getting in to if you if you've been around the people 

470.69 471.25 B: mhm 

472.06 472.63 B: that's true 

473.67 480.22 B: i mean america does have some of its bad sides but it's still the most powerful country in the world i think really it probably is the best country in the world 

480.40 480.88 B: you know 

481.72 482.20 A: yeah 

483.10 483.39 B: hm 

483.66 487.52 A: yeah all those places you were mentioning those would all would be nice places to visit but you 

487.62 489.05 A: y- you always want to come home 

489.68 493.10 B: you know i do wa- i haven't been to brazil yet but i definitely want to go i want to go 

493.53 497.97 B: like my brother was in the navy he tells me everywhere he goes sends me pictures and postcards and i'm so jealous 

498.26 500.43 A: well 

499.51 501.96 B: like man take me with you man put me in your suitcase come on 

502.36 508.61 A: i have never been anywhere but canada for just a day i mean just a day so but um 

510.14 512.21 B: um do you think you'd want to live there if you could relocate 

512.72 514.14 A: you know if i
