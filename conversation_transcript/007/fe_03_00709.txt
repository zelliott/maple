58.11 63.30 B: i think i'm i'm definitely uh in support of our efforts to um 

64.35 67.23 B: make sure that our you know our country is kept safe uh 

66.93 67.42 A: mhm 

68.19 71.02 B: i'm not sure you know it's such a 

71.36 76.15 B: a bad situation uh you n- m- you go in and it's kind of like if there's a 

76.46 78.05 B: a person in your neighborhood that's 

80.95 88.54 B: and there's a lot of children in the house you don't want to you know send an a._t._f. agent in the house and bomb everybody uh 

88.80 89.41 B: there's always that 

89.96 94.30 B: collateral damage i think they call it but on the other hand 

95.44 96.58 B: i think that if we 

96.89 98.47 B: you know don't do anything uh wha- 

99.62 101.50 B: pretty clear to me that uh 

102.37 103.89 B: the forces at work 

104.10 105.39 B: to uh 

105.65 114.32 B: take out our our uh our country uh do what they can so you know i think it's i think it's good that we're we're certainly uh standing up in opposition to it but 

115.13 116.90 B: it's certainly complex 

116.63 117.24 A: yeah 

117.26 119.01 B: situation 

119.11 123.15 B: yeah and if it's as far as the bioterrorism goes i have to confess i don't really know 

119.17 119.57 A: i know 

123.79 126.65 B: an awful lot about you know the the particulars 

127.14 127.88 B: um 

128.18 130.22 B: how how it works uh 

130.80 131.41 B: i know that 

131.94 136.57 B: i think the u._n. just said they they found and um the inspectors in iraq said they found uh 

136.73 141.84 B: i think some some possible warheads that could be filled with bioterrorism 

141.31 142.81 A: yeah with nerve gas right 

143.01 145.82 B: yeah ah yeah neuro- nerve gas or yeah something to that effect i'm i'm 

146.07 151.51 B: i watched yeah president bush's speech last night uh yeah uh gave him uh i saw him 

151.89 162.94 B: you know give pretty careful detail of what they knew um so it you know seems like he is making a pretty strong case that you know something needs to be done i just wonder 

163.09 166.33 B: uh as as opposed to you know just an all out war i wonder if there's other 

166.47 169.70 B: other options uh you know more dip- duh- diplomatic options to 

171.04 172.79 A: yeah it's very hard to um 

171.10 171.43 B: (( yeah )) 

173.59 176.41 A: say like one solution to the problem there isn't really 

177.18 178.22 A: because they say they have 

178.42 180.00 A: um a terrorism threat in 

180.14 181.28 A: north korea also 

181.54 181.97 A: right 

182.00 182.88 B: exactly 

183.10 193.73 B: exactly i me- you know there's there's iran there's uh you know many different countries besides iraq that that have those capabilities and then or are even developing those capabilities 

183.32 183.69 A: so 

184.22 185.11 A: i mean it's not just 

194.34 196.08 A: yeah i wonder if they couldn't um 

196.79 198.64 A: they say that the u._n. inspectors 

199.21 202.22 A: uh didn't do a a thorough search or they're not 

203.03 204.55 A: they gave iraq a b. but 

204.91 208.35 A: that they really didn't get to show -em all the information they were supposed to maybe they should 

209.52 213.47 A: um i don't know a lot a whole lot about the u._n. actually how they pick 

213.83 217.18 A: people to who work the inspectors you know people who do that 

217.50 220.08 B: yes i think that the people who ah 

220.44 221.85 B: are the inspectors have 

222.25 229.53 B: have you know all kinds of experience uh of uh fi- you know first of all what the stuff looks like um you know they they're weapons inspectors um 

230.83 239.78 B: you know so their expertise is probably engineering and um you know and biology and and and you know these guys are are -re definitely 

237.22 237.66 A: mhm 

242.01 243.19 B: calculated and 

243.51 245.64 B: experience at at finding this stuff i i think that 

245.11 245.48 A: well 

246.38 246.88 B: maybe the 

246.39 248.77 A: what are they supposed to do when they find things that 

249.08 249.62 A: he 

250.57 253.55 A: like those empty warheads i mean and they still give them a b. uh 

253.58 256.65 B: yeah yeah i don't i don't know i know that 

257.49 259.70 B: i think they're just supposed to report 

259.87 260.36 B: you know they're 

260.00 261.50 A: uh-huh and 

260.95 262.14 B: they report what they see 

262.55 264.98 A: so they can't really control anything they just 

266.09 269.79 B: they can neither control nor they nor can they uh you know take action 

269.84 273.28 A: so they're just basically giving an inventory of 

273.45 274.09 A: of his 

274.65 276.55 A: um weapons and 

276.93 277.39 A: they can just 

277.71 279.72 A: tell you- tell us what they have but 

280.31 281.96 A: we can't really do anything about it 

282.40 294.21 B: well the u._n. can't do anything about it i think or or at least the inspectors can't but i think their report certainly if it's if it's uh you know really a damning report um they can 

294.32 296.06 B: (( ym- )) uh (( ym- )) the 

296.36 298.31 B: united nations itself can 

298.55 303.69 B: you know certainly strike up a ye- a a an attack or at least you know something to uh 

304.23 309.46 B: to curb saddam hussein i i actually heard today on n._p._r. um that 

309.90 310.56 B: uh 

311.72 313.22 B: colin powell and and the 

313.37 314.99 B: you know the administration is even 

315.59 317.01 B: you know talking about an exile 

317.34 322.15 B: uh for saddam hussein rather than you know just and all out war 

321.31 323.51 A: huh and sending him to uh 

324.32 326.54 A: another country is that right having him go to 

327.93 329.17 A: somewhere else is that right or no 

329.31 335.83 B: uh i exactly exile from iraq um but you know even even that um (( yet )) i'm not sure if 

336.23 339.06 B: that's going to take care of the problem of bioterrorism 

338.25 342.34 A: well yeah because they said well i've read a lot of editorials about it and i've heard that 

348.56 352.18 A: tribe of people that he is from that who all believe the same thing so it's really 

351.61 352.52 B: exactly 

352.30 354.65 A: like an on going problem that can't be solved 

354.80 355.77 B: exactly 

354.84 357.43 A: or has like needs like a long term solution 

357.52 367.19 B: yeah and and that's you know that y- apart from i think the sort of the religious connotations to this war u just just the fact that 

367.53 370.13 B: there's going to be a power vacuum 

370.25 371.18 B: you know once uh 

371.32 376.82 B: saddam hussein is removed and unless the united states is prepared to you know stick around and um 

377.58 379.68 B: def- defend the the people who 

380.77 387.54 B: do saddam hussein from iraq um there's there's going to be you know somebody to take saddam hussein's 

387.69 389.88 B: place that's you know could be even worse 

388.57 388.94 A: yeah 

389.59 398.15 A: because he's made it clear that he doesn't care if saddam hussein has the he doesn't care about the people i mean because the people are saying well maybe he'll change his mind because 

398.43 399.25 A: i know they had 

399.58 399.98 A: um 

400.50 404.44 A: stories in the paper and stuff about iraqi citizens who are saying it's not worth it 

404.55 410.86 A: to go to war again because we all die and uh nothing happens to the other side 

410.55 411.52 B: yeah yeah 

411.36 411.80 A: so 

413.82 419.78 B: well do you do you live in any i mean you don't you don't have to divulge any particular area uh you know of your 

420.24 425.37 B: where you where you live but do you live in any you know place that you would feel the 

426.46 431.57 B: a d- a direct threat to a bioterrorism attack um you know a metropolitan area or 

431.81 436.10 B: anything like that i'm i live in kind of a rural area and i i i um 

431.87 433.12 A: mhm 

436.55 437.38 B: i don't really 

438.62 439.56 B: think uh 

440.25 442.57 B: at least you know my my area 

441.48 444.33 A: well i feel that -at anywhere is of uh you know 

444.72 447.45 A: and they could have a threat anywhere i mean like these little 

447.74 456.77 A: tiny things of anthrax in the mail is you know petty but anywhere i feel is like a target like anywhere where a lot of people are which could include 

456.90 458.98 A: ru- rural surrounding areas 

458.97 459.35 B: mhm 

459.30 461.50 A: you know but i mean 

462.04 463.70 A: i don't feel there's something 

465.31 466.59 A: i don't feel like 

467.66 470.29 A: it's going to happen tomorrow i mean it could but 

470.60 471.17 B: yeah 

470.98 472.52 A: not overly cautious about 

472.67 473.80 A: my mail or anything 

475.08 476.08 B: yeah 

477.28 477.70 A: i don't 

477.83 480.78 A: live at i live about a like a 

482.58 485.33 A: twenty minutes away from the nearest big city so 

485.22 497.13 B: okay yeah same same as you know i live about twenty five miles from you know a pretty you know the capital of our state and uh it it still doesn't really seem like a you know clear 

498.17 500.74 B: threat all the time i um you know walk outside my door 

503.53 503.96 A: yeah 

503.90 509.16 B: my my wife however uh her parents live in new york long island and 

509.17 509.84 B: um they're 

509.93 520.47 B: they're constantly you know talking about the the fact that if anything does happen in new york the you know the down wind the downdraft uh from new york would certainly sweep across long island and 

520.58 521.40 B: uh you know if they're 

522.25 524.12 B: they're they're really conscious 

525.83 527.53 A: yeah it's a really uh 

528.91 530.38 A: are are they older or 

530.43 534.04 B: no they're you know you know middle age you know fifties 

534.53 536.43 A: have they considered moving 

536.36 543.93 B: they haven't and as a matter of fact uh funny -ou say that uh there are a lot of people who are actually moving 

544.42 551.81 B: to new york and to long island and um the housing prices are jumping up and yeah it's it's really kind of crazy it's kind of ironic 

551.74 562.88 A: yeah i think the scare has died down quite a bit from nine eleven i mean i can't imagine what the people feel like that actually live in new york -cause i live so far away from there but u i can i- 

563.11 564.13 A: i mean it's not as
