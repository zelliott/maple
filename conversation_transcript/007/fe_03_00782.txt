220.12 220.54 B: uh huh 

222.75 229.41 A: you know i i'd take being an employee right now myself but that's okay it was by choice so um 

230.05 236.99 A: it's just one of those things i just you know my husband's done a little stuff on the side but if he he ever wanted to do it full time i 

237.45 247.14 A: i don't i don't know that's a little crazy i i don't think i could do it i you know i don't and also the fact that the the money coming in you know it fluctuates every month and you know it 

245.41 245.92 B: right 

247.87 248.20 A: that's 

248.62 253.34 A: too much instability right now with only one income right now so it's a little too crazy 

251.08 251.53 B: yeah 

252.94 253.38 B: yeah 

253.51 253.77 A: but 

253.90 254.35 A: anyways

256.24 257.79 A: now do we wait for them to tell you to 

258.16 259.79 B: no i think that we just end it 

260.07 260.50 A: oh 

260.10 260.90 B: on our own 

260.71 261.48 A: see (( )) 

261.62 265.44 A: every other b- person i've talked to they're like i don't know what are we supposed to do i don't know 

264.77 267.42 B: i know they didn't that was a flaw in study 

267.53 267.92 A: uh huh 

267.74 273.56 B: if they're listening maybe they can uh fix that but they should have told people how to end the phone calls 

273.74 274.36 A: hm 

273.95 275.13 B: it's ridiculous and then 

274.56 276.31 A: so if th- wasn't my imagination either 

276.71 280.04 A: (( )) i live near u. penn and you know i'm like this is kind of weird (( )) 

276.77 277.26 B: so

280.17 280.94 A: you know you would think 

280.35 281.01 B: me too but 

281.48 286.28 B: but uh they didn't they didn't say how to end the phone call and like half the people i talk to 

286.67 293.75 B: thought like okay you're supposed to talk for five minutes and then hang up and then other people are like no the robot's saying it's supposed to come back on 

292.97 293.44 A: hm mhm 

294.28 299.17 B: you know well it's never come back on and i it they also didn't they say it was three phone calls

299.89 300.63 A: i've had four 

299.97 306.14 B: cause this is like my fourth or fifth phone call so i don't know what's going on with that maybe they're just 

302.39 303.30 A: exactly 

305.41 305.89 A: yeah 

307.13 307.38 B: like 

307.44 308.81 A: going through the database again

311.88 312.94 A: the conversation was 

313.06 316.87 A: not that bad for a couple minutes so i can't complain so
