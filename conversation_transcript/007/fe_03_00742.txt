23.02 26.35 B: right right right right how to draw the line of acceptable 

24.05 24.34 A: but 

25.24 26.35 A: yeah but what are we 

26.64 27.97 A: are we suppose to just talk 

28.07 35.01 B: we're suppose to just talk for ten minutes about how we draw the line from acceptable to unacceptable humor 

29.69 30.68 A: okay 

34.30 36.85 A: okay well 

35.76 39.92 B: so dana i'm going to let you start on that 

38.04 40.94 A: okay well i guess i do it by 

41.47 43.36 A: um depending on what 

44.89 54.64 A: offends me and what doesn't which much doesn't most things don't offend me so if somebody's telling a joke and i hear it it doesn't really usually bother me if i know it's a joke 

54.74 55.27 A: um 

56.02 60.16 A: i guess acceptable to me is anything that like doesn't offend 

61.27 62.84 A: like race or religion 

63.84 64.58 A: um 

65.84 66.78 A: and that's probably 

66.87 67.66 A: about it 

67.93 72.77 A: anything that doesn't get to personal about a person like with a disability a race or religion 

73.37 75.14 B: i agree i i would say that 

75.82 78.82 B: you know i'm even i think a little bit more liberal like 

78.98 80.50 B: in the fact that 

80.74 83.32 B: even if it kind of offends me i'm 

83.42 88.48 B: just going to kind of let it go like i'll walk away and just not listen to it rather than confront 

87.21 87.74 A: right 

88.71 91.19 B: the person which maybe i should but 

91.29 95.69 B: kind of non confrontational unless it's really really offensive 

95.48 95.99 A: mhm 

95.97 97.73 B: people have the right to say 

97.94 104.41 B: what they want to to whether i i believe i like it or not you know i have the choice to walk away from their humor 

104.95 105.40 A: right 

105.99 106.38 B: so 

106.77 107.24 B: but 

107.34 117.12 B: and you know i think it's a personal choice you know if something's offensive or you feel like it might be offensive as far as movie or book then don't rent it or don't listen to it or 

117.35 118.73 B: you know don't buy it 

118.55 120.60 A: right it just should be something that you don't 

121.49 123.57 A: you know participate in really i guess 

123.72 124.01 A: but 

124.06 127.32 B: yeah and i i that think most the times people are just 

127.57 131.49 B: at least maybe in an office setting are telling jokes just to kind of 

131.64 133.87 B: pass the time you know and 

132.89 133.88 A: right or with 

134.16 136.40 A: with people that they know or 

136.08 137.35 B: right i don't think 

137.09 139.19 A: feel comfortable with talking to 

139.39 141.58 B: exactly like people i don't think 

142.89 146.39 B: mostly are like trying to offend people with 

146.49 151.46 B: their humor i mean maybe howard stern is but other then him 

149.86 154.31 A: right but but then also if you're like offended by that you're usually not going to listen to it 

154.31 155.72 B: exactly 

154.71 155.36 A: if you 

155.46 157.13 A: are offended by something 

157.30 157.66 A: so 

166.04 168.61 A: right 

175.84 177.28 B: being offended 

176.92 177.38 A: right 

177.65 178.01 B: so 

178.13 180.32 B: that's my opinion 

179.46 182.32 A: okay 

180.80 184.67 B: i think we have to keep talking though about comedy 

182.63 186.33 A: all right so 

185.03 186.65 B: uh-huh 

186.81 188.26 A: i'm trying to think what else 

188.80 189.84 A: about comedy 

190.10 197.92 A: i don't really consider it comedy when somebody like telling a joke but okay um 

195.91 197.74 B: yeah (( true )) go with it 

199.56 201.89 A: i don't know yeah like i said i mean something that like 

202.07 202.92 A: anything that like 

203.37 208.60 A: would offend a person like if it had to do like with a disability that might affect the person or 

209.70 211.14 A: race or religion 

211.67 213.80 A: anything like that it's kind of touchy to 

211.74 212.08 B: yeah 

214.63 220.53 A: joke about with i mean unless it's like your family you know that you know isn't going to be offended 

217.41 218.60 B: right 

220.67 222.40 A: in a work place environment 

222.61 223.35 A: i don't think that 

224.56 229.51 B: but you know what i've actually realized recently i don't even know how i came up 

224.69 226.02 A: proper 

227.96 228.95 A: well 

229.62 235.09 B: i kind of know how i came across it it's really hard to tell a joke that isn't making fun 

234.90 236.28 A: of something yeah 

235.63 240.55 B: of some ev- even like a blonde joke if you think about it is making fun of 

238.94 239.62 A: right 

240.66 242.94 B: you know a group of people 

242.39 243.71 A: right exactly 

243.07 251.74 B: so i mean that's kind of i could see where comedians or especially like stand up like would have trouble totally not offending anybody because 

252.29 255.55 B: you know what do you base it on then what do you base your comedy on if 

255.32 258.38 A: right you have to yeah you have to talk about somebody 

258.64 259.18 B: i mean i 

259.02 263.06 A: i guess it's it's different thought too for like a professional comedian i think 

263.31 263.90 B: yeah 

264.31 267.99 A: to be up there and they can just talk about whatever they want because that's what they're 

268.26 274.98 A: paid to do and that's what people are paying to see them to do as opposed to joking like in a workplace where 

276.05 276.95 A: somebody 

277.53 280.39 A: you know makes a joke and it might offend somebody that they're speaking to 

280.58 281.13 B: yeah 

280.95 282.58 A: you know it's like those people then 

283.01 286.87 A: ask to be there really they could just walk away or whatever but 

287.52 287.87 B: yeah 

287.79 289.20 A: it's a little bit different 

290.71 295.06 A: right i'm not a i'm not a good joke teller i don't remember them all 

294.05 304.35 B: me too i always i always forget like the key line of the joke like the punch line i'll mess up every time 

295.25 298.28 A: i don't want to be the one to offend somebody so 

301.27 301.80 A: right 

302.18 302.83 A: right 

303.81 309.16 A: that's how i am i don't tell them so i just let other people tell the, that way i'm not the culprit of 

304.62 306.29 B: so 

309.41 310.59 B: right 

309.49 313.09 A: what's acceptable and what's not acceptable 

313.23 319.49 B: because you know i have actually seen people get called into what ever office they get called into to 

319.76 322.16 B: be reprimanded for telling 

320.71 322.45 A: for making a joke yeah 

322.45 329.26 B: tasteless or off color or what ever it may be so there's definitely a line there but it's hard to define 

324.34 325.03 A: yeah 

329.40 331.28 B: for anybody to define i think what 

331.39 334.31 B: the actually line is you know like 

332.97 333.48 A: right 

334.63 335.32 B: i guess it just 

335.64 337.27 B: i don't know who it would depend on 

337.65 338.28 A: yeah 

338.44 338.97 B: who 

338.51 339.47 A: my aunt (( always )) 

353.61 354.44 B: right 

357.78 358.56 A: i mean i'm 

359.46 360.49 A: i have um 

360.69 367.36 A: a partly polish background so if i get a polish joke i laugh and think it's funny 

367.60 370.65 A: to them that's like offensive 

370.45 376.29 B: yeah and and like i you know to tell you the truth i do like there have been jokes about the catholic church that 

376.47 378.83 B: being catholic and not even a devout catholic just 

378.93 383.60 B: having grown up in that environment like i'll start to get a little bit offended but 

383.95 388.38 B: i don't even know what it is and i'm like all right it's a joke 

384.62 385.36 A: right 

386.59 387.18 A: right 

387.40 390.29 A: right not to take it so literally sometimes yeah 

388.97 394.99 B: like no body trying to hurt my feelings with this joke i just have to get over it 

392.57 393.24 A: right 

394.73 397.25 A: but it's not directly it's not directed 

397.66 400.52 A: right at you specifically you know it's not 

400.72 401.61 A: like it's suppose to 

402.18 406.67 A: they didn't meant to like single you out and say like i know that you are so 

406.84 410.04 B: yeah so i'm going to tell you i mean you know there are those guys 

410.24 415.14 B: that do do that that are like i have some blonde jokes for you 

411.35 411.96 A: right 

414.13 415.69 A: right yeah so let's 

416.64 418.74 A: run them by you and see how (( )) 

417.79 426.04 B: but then i'm just like i bleach my hair so i don't have to take this offensively 

420.37 423.90 A: so right you don't have to take this literally 

424.65 426.19 A: that's right i agree 

426.76 427.82 B: so but 

427.98 429.25 B: i mean i know that like 

429.60 439.15 B: i know and i listen to howard stern although i'm like so ashamed to admit it and i know that people call up all the time and are offended and i actually feel kind of bad with 

434.11 434.52 A: right 

439.78 446.93 B: some of the things he does with people like with disabilities and like it's like you're laughing and you feel bad for laughing 

440.94 442.22 A: yeah
