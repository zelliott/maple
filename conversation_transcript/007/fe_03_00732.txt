16.76 17.96 A: uh we are supposed to discuss 

18.28 19.26 A: terrorism and 

18.92 19.80 B: i would panic 

20.14 24.16 A: you would panic i would probably panic too depending on the situation though but 

20.82 21.37 B: yeah huh 

23.87 26.66 B: it would depend on what the terrorist acts act was 

27.01 29.82 A: yeah i agree there because i know i was in a fire once 

29.98 32.73 A: and i panicked but then all of a sudden i became totally calm 

33.42 34.84 A: so i don't if that is just like 

34.99 36.33 A: the fear overcomes you 

37.00 37.70 A: you know what i mean 

37.86 40.74 B: i think if it were something like anthrax 

40.96 42.57 B: or something i would be very calm 

43.37 49.32 A: do you think so i don't know i'm part of military and i've had my anthrax shot 

44.21 44.71 B: yes 

44.83 46.13 B: yeah but i think 

48.10 52.08 B: but i think if it were yeah because then i think it 

53.41 54.58 B: it's a slight 

54.96 61.06 B: but i think if i were like if i were in a fire if i were in a a building that were exploding or something like that then i 

60.45 61.61 A: collapsing or something 

61.31 62.90 B: yeah then i would be 

61.75 62.37 A: yeah 

63.25 69.94 A: that is what i think too but i don't know well if there is something in the air though -cause i served in the persian gulf war and all the stuff we breathed in was pretty freaky 

70.67 72.83 A: so that is kind of a scary thought because 

73.00 73.61 A: if you 

74.01 78.19 A: if you know how all of that works it slowly just tears apart your body from the inside out so 

77.97 84.16 B: my friends tell me (( )) i always operate on the best case scenario like if it is supposed to take ten minutes to get somewhere 

84.50 84.92 A: uh-huh 

85.92 89.16 B: i don't leave i don't leave the extra minutes in case there is traffic 

89.66 92.94 B: so i would i would uh 

92.25 93.07 A: that is cool 

93.07 97.02 B: so if i'm supposed to be somewhere at nine o'clock i leave at ten to nine but 

96.61 97.12 A: right 

97.30 98.48 B: so i just would think 

98.96 100.00 B: it is not going to happen to me 

100.73 101.19 A: right 

101.36 108.41 A: well we can we can hope not but i think i would probably panic it depends if i'm by myself or with my kids if i don't have my kids with me i would probably 

101.40 101.71 B: uh 

108.08 114.91 B: i don't have children and uh you know what i would imagine children would change your your perspective on this completely 

109.71 111.24 A: i would probably panic for my kids 

115.19 116.91 A: right i agree is this your 

117.16 118.83 A: your first call that you've done or 

118.94 119.33 B: yeah 

119.61 120.61 A: okay so 

120.76 122.96 A: what happens at the end 

122.05 125.57 B: i don't know i i don't know i really don't understand this whole 

125.83 128.91 B: process it's i got a couple of calls 

129.27 129.98 B: yesterday 

130.33 130.72 A: uh-huh 

132.02 133.20 B: between eight and ten 

133.35 136.33 B: which is probably not a great time -cause that is when i eat dinner 

136.24 136.76 A: right 

136.67 137.58 B: but um 

140.27 144.23 B: nothing happened i mean i would key in my number and then they had to find a call partner 

144.76 149.13 A: huh maybe they just didn't find somebody they've called me every night but usually we are at dinner or something 

149.30 153.40 A: so i'm in the process of cooking dinner but i figured i can accept and talk and cook at the same time 

153.06 155.99 B: yeah i yeah well that is what happened to me tonight i was uh 

156.38 157.39 B: making dinner and 

157.89 160.96 B: and then a call came and then it didn't the other night someone 

161.32 163.30 B: uh called and then they couldn't find a call partner 

164.05 164.43 A: huh 

167.83 168.61 A: well i think 

168.90 170.70 A: given the situation i would probably 

171.09 174.40 A: i would probably panic either way just i would be pissed more than anything 

175.44 176.59 A: i think 

176.11 179.06 B: how long were you uh were you at you were in uh 

179.31 181.15 B: uh you were in iraq 

180.98 182.46 A: um i was actually in saudi 

182.86 183.45 B: oh really 

183.59 183.93 A: yeah 

183.96 185.39 B: how did they treat you there as a woman 

186.35 189.33 A: um interesting they stare a lot and stuff -cause they are not used to 

190.52 190.93 A: (( )) 

191.98 192.27 A: it was 

192.60 195.36 A: it was interesting i mean we had some moments of panic there when 

196.54 198.82 A: gun missiles are supposed to be coming and all this other stuff 

199.55 200.92 A: so it was kind of interesting 

201.02 201.29 A: but 

201.90 204.44 A: i think i would panic 

204.07 208.20 B: gosh you know what i don't really know what i would i mean 

209.60 214.90 B: my fear of going pla- i had some real fears like i'm very claustrophobic i'm afraid of elevators 

215.06 215.67 A: uh-huh 

215.53 217.15 B: but i'm not afraid to go to los angeles 

217.27 219.05 B: part i live in washington 

218.83 219.19 A: uh-huh 

219.24 221.28 B: i'm not afraid to go to (( los angeles )) from washington 

222.03 222.72 B: um 

222.81 224.59 A: because you can control that situation 

224.24 224.60 B: yeah 

224.94 229.98 A: you can you can get out of your element you can't get out of an elevator 
228.64 230.04 B: that is right that is exactly right 

230.91 232.69 B: so i that is why i would think 

232.81 237.21 B: if i were if i were in a building i would panic if it were anthrax i think i could deal with it 

237.76 238.47 A: right 

238.84 243.67 B: because it wouldn't be confining i mean it's all i guess it is all our own psychology 

244.05 244.57 A: right 

244.91 245.72 A: that makes sense 

246.67 250.87 A: yeah i would have to probably agree with you there so 

250.11 253.14 B: yeah as long as you can have a measure of control 

253.93 256.26 B: i think you could handle the situation if you can't 

256.67 257.73 B: if you lose control 

257.30 260.54 A: that is exactly what it is if you can't control it then you panic more 

259.68 260.42 B: then you panic 

260.71 261.04 B: yes 

260.90 263.76 A: but if you can control it you are uh you know you are in control 

264.27 265.82 A: you are less apt to freak out i think 

266.17 269.00 B: although when for example when the terrorist attacks 

269.50 270.96 B: took place on nine eleven 

269.53 269.91 A: mhm 

271.12 275.41 B: i was in washington i didn't think that i didn't think an airplane was coming to my house 

276.19 281.09 B: yeah i live i live about ten blocks from the white house or twelve blocks from the white house yeah where do you live 

279.19 279.86 A: oh really 

281.06 281.66 A: california 

282.29 283.91 B: uh i just (( )) 

284.28 287.26 B: didn't even occur to me that the next attack was coming to washington 

286.83 287.37 A: right 

287.45 290.63 B: and although my mom called and said oh my god get out of washington 

290.41 292.64 A: right get out of the way 

293.29 299.23 A: and you were probably like there is nothing to worry about because you could control the situation you could see what is coming 

297.36 297.91 B: that is right 

298.56 299.85 B: yeah that is exactly right 

300.21 300.60 A: so 

300.71 301.11 A: oh that's 

301.23 302.20 A: too funny okay 

301.71 303.38 B: although i i must say that 

303.52 304.01 B: uh 

305.76 308.40 B: i was moved to tears when the second building collapsed 

308.76 309.86 A: yeah that was very 

309.27 310.99 B: i really i just started to cry 

311.38 312.09 A: that was very 

312.31 315.85 A: very disturbing still is i have a picture of it right on my refrigerator 
315.76 316.34 B: do you really 

316.46 316.92 A: oh yeah 

320.32 325.22 B: i have some old uh my my niece was married in new york 

320.59 320.95 A: so 

325.72 326.29 B: and 

326.49 329.39 B: the day she was married there was an event selling some 

330.06 336.18 B: p- uh some you know like watercolors this was about five years ago and one of them was of the twin towers and so i bought it 

332.27 332.62 A: mhm 

336.39 337.05 A: oh really 

336.39 339.35 B: and it is still on my (( )) wall yeah 

338.64 339.49 A: that is cool 

340.47 344.50 A: well i think everything that transpired since september eleventh definitely opens up everybody's eyes 

344.99 347.53 A: and everybody just doesn't act like oh it can never happen to us 

346.24 357.13 B: on the other hand i hate these experts that come on television and say we could have prevented it or warnings weren't heated i don't want my life changed 

352.88 353.31 A: right 

357.06 357.55 A: right 

357.82 358.45 B: to 

359.88 363.25 B: live a kind of life where i would be afraid of terrorism 

363.53 364.05 A: right 

364.13 367.96 B: i mean these people who criticize clinton and criticized bush 

368.08 372.67 B: for not seeing this terror what were they supposed to do anyway 

373.14 378.31 B: i mean really we've been hearing for ten twelve fifteen years that there was a 

378.49 380.36 B: possibility of a terrorist attack 

379.90 382.33 A: that is right they would have done it one way or another you know 

382.09 386.53 B: i mean what were we supposed to do i in fact i think even this airport security is a joke 

386.53 386.98 A: uh-huh 

387.31 387.87 B: i mean 

388.70 395.74 B: it's a year since it's over a year since nine eleven and nothing has happened and there's no airport the airport security is the same as it was before 

395.57 396.26 A: right 

397.64 398.43 A: well i think there is 

398.66 402.48 A: there is all kinds of forms of terrorism it is a matter of what you are approached with 

404.56 405.08 A: you know 

404.58 406.82 B: and you tr- did they train you at all for terrorists 

407.37 407.86 A: oh yeah 

408.14 410.20 A: oh yeah you have chemical biological and 

410.35 411.12 A: all that warfare 

413.47 416.13 B: do you think that's bush's right to uh try and get rid of saddam 

416.96 419.79 A: um yeah we should have done it in we should have done it in nine- 

419.41 420.80 B: i know i know we should have done it 

420.96 423.26 B: i won't disagree with you there but what about now 

424.16 424.80 A: um 

425.50 430.91 A: yeah but i think it involves more than that -cause you know if korea gets involved in stuff then you know we have more problems on our heads 

431.31 432.35 A: than we can probably handle 

432.66 435.68 A: they just need to get some allies to back us if we don't have the allies we are screwed 

436.40 438.63 A: that is my opinion 

438.53 441.65 B: do you think there is a direct link between saddam and terrorism 

442.96 443.68 A: um 

443.51 444.19 B: (( )) 

444.03 446.83 A: the current terrorism with afghanistan no 

445.38 446.67 B: me too i should have r- 

447.28 447.80 A: no 

447.54 448.96 B: between uh saddam and al qaeda 

449.89 450.89 A: hm 

451.48 452.28 B: see i don't 

452.27 454.90 A: i don't think so no i think it is a whole separate issue 

455.02 457.09 B: and therefore i don't think there is a cause for war 

456.95 460.51 A: you know -cause saddam's way of hurting us is hey let's jack up 

460.67 463.20 A: gas prices you know 

463.99 465.90 B: i think he is a son of a gun who should 

466.37 469.44 B: fall on his own weight or that the world community should 

469.59 475.25 B: it scares me though with the world community removing the leader what is to stop them from removing a good leader then 

475.52 476.00 A: right 

476.86 481.53 B: i i think we don't examine the unintended consequences of our actions and i don't frankly 

482.62 483.73 B: don't think president bush 

483.98 491.48 B: looks to to see the unintended consequences i think president clinton for all his faults at least looked around to see what 

491.70 497.26 B: what the unintended consequences of his political actions could be not his personal actions 

495.01 495.62 A: uh-huh 

497.70 498.59 A: right 

497.82 500.19 B: but but certainly 

500.89 501.76 B: he was more careful 

502.21 504.16 A: right yeah i totally agree 

506.79 508.56 A: it is all politics 

508.05 510.42 B: yeah well it has all to do with terrorism i guess 

510.52 513.40 A: that is true that is true 

512.75 513.96 B: how many kids do you have 

514.26 514.81 A: (( around )) three 

515.04 516.01 B: oh wow 

516.79 517.22 A: so
