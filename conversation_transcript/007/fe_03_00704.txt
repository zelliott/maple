12.60 15.62 B: don't know what to say about that how they can 

16.25 17.38 A: did you um 

17.86 21.91 A: did you watch yesterday's um the president's speech 

21.96 25.06 B: yeah part of it i did not not (( )) 

24.12 24.74 A: okay 

25.18 27.07 B: not all of it but i did watch part of it 

27.30 29.80 A: okay um well 

29.88 31.31 A: do you where do you live 

31.54 32.69 B: i live in montana 

32.77 33.81 A: montana 

33.53 34.53 B: yeah 

33.91 35.74 A: so you probably don't feel that 

36.11 36.50 A: that 

36.57 37.70 A: like scared 

36.59 38.70 B: that it is much of a threat right 

38.40 43.99 A: yeah well see um when anthrax started i was in florida 

44.16 44.58 B: oh 

44.69 44.99 A: and 

45.09 47.30 A: so um it really was 

47.37 51.25 A: really scary because basically when september eleventh 

51.61 52.31 A: happened 

51.62 51.91 B: yeah 

52.71 59.29 A: i was in florida and they closed the whole state of florida like nobody can come in nobody can go out 

56.50 57.12 B: right 

59.18 59.56 B: right 

59.71 60.35 A: so um 

60.91 64.67 A: that was really scary but so what do you think like uh is 

64.87 66.45 A: is it like do you 

65.87 76.23 B: well you know i'm i i think they have made the right steps towards it with the with the homeland security and and that um but there i feel that there is also a danger there 

71.13 71.70 A: uh-huh 

76.30 76.86 A: mhm 

76.50 77.40 B: of them going 

77.53 78.32 B: too far 

78.44 80.81 B: and taking away some of our rights you know 

78.51 79.13 A: yeah 

81.29 89.27 A: yeah kind of yeah do you do you think that was right for like the post office now they have this new regulation 

89.79 90.22 A: and 

90.44 91.10 A: well like 

91.27 95.60 A: used to be like they they don't require you to write a return address 

95.70 97.54 A: and like um but 

97.98 104.20 A: now they ask lots more questions when you mail stuff right is that the same over in your place 

101.44 102.66 B: yeah 

104.79 110.82 B: um not really i haven't had any well i guess yeah when i'm mailing packages they they do ask if there is 

111.26 112.56 B: you know anything 

112.79 117.32 B: basically i thought it was just normal questions though because they ask you know perishable or 

117.77 119.09 B: or or you know 

119.40 126.40 B: that they didn't really specifically say is there a a bomb in there or anything explosive you know 

126.27 127.85 A: yeah 

128.00 128.69 A: so that is 

128.72 132.06 B: or or you know i mean and they didn't really 

128.84 129.16 A: see 

129.60 129.89 A: but 

133.99 134.82 B: you know 

134.96 139.62 B: i guess with wh- with bio-terrorism i guess you know with packages and stuff i guess they could 

140.07 142.23 B: maybe x-ray -em or something you know 

142.69 147.31 A: well it is kind of hard to do that because sometimes some bio-terrorism 

143.13 143.81 B: i don't know 

147.40 149.40 A: stuff isn't like detectable 

148.75 150.50 B: a powder or something yeah 

158.39 159.09 B: yeah 

158.52 160.64 A: like twenty twenty those kind of programs 

160.84 161.22 B: yeah 

161.02 164.75 A: they have like thirty (( )) like um the middle eastern countries 

164.87 165.38 B: uh-huh 

165.29 169.18 A: they are trying to figure out like how to do you have you heard of dirty (( )) 

169.97 170.57 B: um 

170.72 171.78 B: no i don't think i have 

172.23 176.05 A: the they dirty (( )) that it is like it is not really clear um 

176.19 176.71 A: (( )) 

177.18 180.60 A: but they are like made out of of the stuff that is similar 

181.09 182.80 A: and it is not it is like it is 

183.49 190.97 A: it doesn't like destroy it doesn't have like um you you won't destroy like a lot of life but but it is very easy to make 

191.37 192.03 B: yeah 

191.44 192.81 A: and so it is kind of 

192.97 193.82 A: scary 

193.96 197.11 B: uh wh- what i think is real scary is is you know if they put something 

197.51 199.72 B: if they if they uh contaminated our water 

200.18 202.17 B: mean because everybody needs water 

200.25 201.66 A: oh yeah 

202.61 203.17 A: i know 

202.69 203.24 B: i know 

203.30 204.87 A: and you know what heard like 

205.20 208.44 A: i heard somebody say that the best way to like get people 

208.54 209.10 A: sick is 

209.21 210.59 A: to go to a buffet 

210.87 215.75 A: and spread something on the buffet that is so sickening 

212.49 213.20 B: oh 

213.90 214.17 B: wait 

214.72 218.73 B: well it was kind of um scary did you hear about when all those um 

219.16 223.37 B: cruise ships everybody was getting sick you know you go on vacation i mean 

221.10 222.17 A: i know 

222.67 224.24 A: oh my gosh yeah 

224.29 224.93 B: you know 

224.76 226.12 A: have you been on a cruise 

225.84 228.64 B: i've always wanted to go on one and now i don't know 

229.01 229.65 B: (( )) 

233.71 238.69 A: scary when i was there but now i think of that because everybody is on the ship 

235.30 235.75 B: uh-huh 

239.13 240.44 A: and it is not if 

240.54 244.19 A: something happened the whole you know everybody gets 

244.34 247.93 A: sick like there is nowhere that you know you can be 

248.23 250.27 A: prevented from that 

249.93 250.75 B: yeah 

250.53 255.38 A: so yeah so yeah i really wonder what was that but i think it 

255.04 255.36 B: i 

255.48 257.65 A: just kind of stop already 

257.69 259.47 B: yeah i hope so i mean 

260.41 262.61 A: yeah i mean the bio-terrorism is 

263.29 264.14 A: is just very 

264.28 264.86 A: scary it 

265.13 267.55 A: yeah i i don't know why we are (( )) 

265.75 266.35 B: well i 

266.76 268.95 B: you know and i know that they have a lot of um 

269.89 270.26 B: um 

270.36 272.80 B: secret intelligence out there that gather 

273.38 276.17 B: you know a lot of information on suspected 

276.36 276.82 B: you know

281.40 282.41 A: well i 

281.80 283.85 B: hopefully they they are smart people 

284.18 293.06 A: you know i kind of thought that um i don't know if you watch news maybe like one or two weeks ago they said there were like um more than ten people 

293.54 295.73 A: came across the canadian border 

296.31 297.12 A: to the u._s. 

297.79 299.38 A: have you heard about that 

299.82 303.97 B: no but you know what that would be really easy to do probably something like that in montana 

304.31 306.05 A: yeah and so it is kind of 

306.19 307.43 A: scary because 

311.37 312.77 B: huh

466.80 467.89 A: i see

476.01 476.74 B: i mean -m 

477.90 479.27 B: you know basically when it is 

479.38 479.73 B: when it is 

481.11 485.27 B: when it is happening and just shortly after you know and it is not splattered all over 

485.50 486.08 B: the news 

486.23 486.75 A: mhm 

487.05 489.29 B: i mean that is when people talk about it the most but 

489.54 490.62 B: they you know 

491.26 492.59 B: they seem to forget about it 

492.79 496.20 B: soon after because you know everyone gets on with their lives and it is 
496.58 498.64 B: really so far away from here 

498.92 499.83 B: that we don't really 

498.94 499.65 A: yeah 

502.31 504.01 B: we don't really think about it

510.01 510.56 B: no 

511.09 511.49 B: no 

512.85 519.10 A: they just talk about war on terrorism every day and i kind of get a little bit tired of it because 

518.45 522.19 B: i mean there might be people around around here that do but not 

523.06 524.01 B: people i know 

524.11 526.19 A: well i'm i'm talking about like news

541.46 543.62 B: it is basically whatever is going on locally 

544.40 545.53 B: that they put on 

544.42 545.34 A: yeah that 

545.87 550.34 A: that would be nice i think that is because we have like some li- air force 

550.45 551.51 A: base here 

551.97 558.52 A: near oklahoma city so they talk about it a lot because i think they are being (( )) now
