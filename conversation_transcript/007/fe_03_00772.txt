186.62 187.47 B: (( to )) 

188.33 189.39 B: yeah 

189.74 195.81 A: ah the one thing that i say that we miss in this country though is we have to get our our insurance

200.80 206.27 B: yeah yeah i see and i haven't i haven't thought about that 

201.86 202.90 A: because 

205.84 214.23 A: and because of health insurances and taking care of the reason i say that is i had an uncle who came down with that alzheimer 

214.00 215.11 B: oh uh-huh 

214.62 219.43 A: and he went through every cent he had and he had a lot of money 

218.98 220.13 B: sure 

219.97 224.59 A: he was a single fellow he had a farm land and so on sorth so forth 

224.98 231.40 A: but a few years ago there was no ah homes that would take him or anything any place to care for him 

229.59 230.84 B: (( oh my )) 

231.28 232.32 B: yeah 

231.93 236.41 A: and the cost was about three hundred and eighty three dollars a day 

236.35 238.56 B: oh my wow 

237.82 239.90 A: and when he got through 

240.03 244.25 A: um most of his estate was gone and so on and so forth 

243.96 245.09 B: yeah 

244.86 245.81 A: (( and ah )) 

246.20 248.90 A: so that is a concern for myself 

248.04 251.64 B: well and and as far as you know i know there is a big ah 

251.93 255.47 B: oh you know talking about how much prescription drugs cost 

254.91 258.55 A: well see here we're always going across the border for the 

258.32 259.37 B: yeah 

258.63 265.34 A: the the dentals to be quite frankly we go across to have our dental work and we also go over for the prescriptions 

265.05 267.51 B: yeah yeah and 

266.34 268.50 A: because they're so much cheaper 

268.29 269.43 B: yeah 

269.30 272.65 A: but i think you could do it if you were to go on line 

273.00 278.05 A: you can find canadian companies but i don't know exactly how it works 

277.82 278.91 B: yeah i don't 

278.06 282.91 A: but here we were sneaking it across is what's really going on it's ah 

282.13 283.35 B: yeah 

283.59 289.80 B: an- and it's too bad that you have to do that you know that it's so high in high here that you have to do that and 

286.04 287.08 A: (( this )) 

289.50 293.90 A: young lady here she's looking up at grandpa talking on the phone to a lady
