328.46 329.71 A: and you know 

334.27 335.96 A: yeah you know i mean 

336.37 344.27 A: they play it over all through the year all year long about september eleven you know the stories over you know news stories old stories 

345.27 347.43 A: it is just unimaginable 

346.98 348.21 B: mhm 

347.65 349.03 A: just unimaginable 

349.08 350.20 B: it is 

350.10 353.35 A: oh i saw it on t._v. i'm like okay what is this um 

353.62 357.37 A: something from a movie or something i think this better not happen here 

355.36 356.32 B: oh

357.83 358.89 A: (( [noise] )) 

367.32 370.31 B: so i turned on my like oh my god 

369.10 372.13 A: we saw every channel every channel 

370.67 371.88 B: uh-huh 

371.90 386.86 B: and then i sat there all day and watched it and then when my husband gets home from work we watched it all night and i watched it for like three days in a row and it was like i can't watch this any more i'm just getting anxiety and it makes me sick to my stomach 

380.63 381.95 A: mhm 

383.81 384.98 A: yeah 

386.18 397.15 A: amazing you know there is like all of a sudden all the large towers and things like that were probably the next targets in all these cities and i'm like okay we have a lot of that downtown here 

396.79 398.44 B: mhm 

397.39 401.22 A: and you know our news stations here you know are 

401.60 404.14 A: if houston radio no 

404.22 409.86 A: 'cause if the country was all ready you can imagine do you think actually once would be ready no 

408.98 410.22 B: mhm 

410.49 412.38 A: (( no not at all )) 

412.02 417.63 B: and we were really worried here because we're the air cost capital of the world here so yes 

415.69 416.71 A: really 

417.84 421.56 B: so it was just really kind of you know scary and 

420.96 422.54 A: yeah 

421.85 426.51 B: the base was in a like really high security and all that and 

426.11 426.69 A: (( [noise] i )) 

427.13 433.94 A: don't know i mean i i you wonder could could that you know anything could have been done i mean 

434.35 438.83 A: is it possible something could have been done to stop it i mean maybe to stop it 

439.32 447.19 A: like it was you know how it went down with so many lives being taken but i don't think they would have been able to stop it without somebody getting killed 

445.34 446.49 B: mhm 

447.15 448.23 B: mhm 

447.93 454.08 A: i mean 'cause they let a lot of people in this country that were living right next door to people and 

454.77 459.98 A: doctors and things like that plotting against this country and i'm like 

456.94 458.26 B: mhm 

460.49 463.51 A: now you don't know who to trust 

462.85 463.98 B: yeah 

463.74 465.07 A: you don't know 

464.14 465.10 B: yeah 

466.28 472.01 B: we almost wondered too if the uh plane that went down in pennsylvania or wherever 

470.78 472.40 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

472.02 473.95 B: if that was shot down 

474.46 475.80 B: you know i mean 

474.94 478.13 A: you know they never said anything else about that 

477.52 484.38 B: yeah i mean they've talked and talked about how the passengers like overtook the terrorists and crashed it and all that but 

482.51 483.44 A: uh-huh 

484.64 495.81 B: we don't know for sure i mean they could have got wind that that plane was coming to the white house and sent out an airforce one that or whatever you know to go and knock it out 

490.16 490.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

493.75 494.70 A: yeah 

495.12 495.70 A: (( [noise] )) 

496.83 498.45 A: mhm 

497.71 498.77 B: so 

499.80 501.04 B: i don't know 

500.97 507.61 A: uh-huh i mean it's something that really you know can be discussed for hours and hours you know because 

506.48 509.29 B: yeah yeah it could [laughter] 

508.53 515.81 A: i mean the thing that i did not like was the medias concern is that they didn't focus too much on the pentagon you know 

515.55 516.99 B: mhm 

515.87 516.93 A: i mean 

517.19 521.96 A: new york city was hit the hardest okay we agree but you know 

522.03 524.48 A: what about these people at the pentagon 

524.15 525.11 B: yes 

524.59 529.56 A: you know they didn't really cover too much of that and maybe because it's the government you know 

529.57 530.56 B: yeah 

529.76 537.04 A: which is understandable but i mean i thought they should have gotten a little more coverage you know besides just manhattan 

534.95 536.07 B: (( mhm )) 

537.09 540.19 B: yeah i mean their families were hurting too 

538.92 542.46 A: yeah you know and nobody has heard all of their stories 

541.93 543.13 B: mhm 

543.39 547.10 A: but i mean well if they do whatever they do 

547.15 548.52 B: yeah 

548.64 550.45 B: [sigh] i know it 

550.94 553.71 B: so how did you hear about the phone studies 

553.13 554.93 A: [noise] uh

567.25 568.45 A: so [laughter]
