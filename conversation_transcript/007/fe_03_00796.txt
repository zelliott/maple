0.40 2.34 A: hello my name is brenda 

2.37 3.79 B: what is your name 

3.70 4.61 A: brenda 

4.42 6.22 B: brenda my name is sandy 

6.77 7.95 B: nice to meet you 

7.71 8.65 A: thank you 

9.13 12.42 B: okay so we're supposed to talk about opening a business huh 

12.11 13.98 A: ah sounds that way 

13.75 20.66 B: okay it's something i've actually been thinking about a lot but i don't even know how to go about it 

20.68 27.70 A: well actually i worked at a bank for i guess eighteen years and part of that time i worked in a loan department 

25.20 25.97 B: (( mm )) 

27.94 32.55 A: so i know you know what's involved in getting the funding 

28.02 28.93 B: okay 

32.90 34.64 A: ah together for a business 

34.67 38.73 A: you know you've got to have a business plan and you have to present financial 

36.83 38.28 B: yeah 

38.88 42.36 A: statements ah you know they prefer that you have um 

44.34 49.41 A: ah you know a plan put together as far as you know ah 

50.57 58.50 A: potential buildings that you can rent the cost of ah [sigh] you know the rent so what you'd anticipate the utilities would run the 

58.33 59.39 B: okay 

58.99 62.26 A: more detailed the better as far as getting funding goes 

62.33 65.70 B: oh well you know a lot more about it than i do already [laughter] 

64.60 69.44 A: and then you have to have a financial statement you know showing your assets and liabilities and 

69.53 76.04 A: you know hopefully you know that can secure a loan if not then you know you'll have to put a bit of collateral for it 

70.09 70.89 B: yeah 

75.77 77.27 B: yeah 

76.44 79.32 A: ah that would probably be the first test and then 

79.43 80.27 B: um 

80.28 83.76 B: what type of business have you thought about or have you actually 

83.52 86.45 A: ah if i were to do it [sigh] 

87.02 91.59 A: i do computer work a lot i'd probably open a computer store probably 

91.87 94.65 A: ah you know build and sell computers 

94.57 95.88 B: oh wow 

95.72 99.20 A: would be what i would do ah service those 

99.37 101.32 B: that would be a good thing to get into 

101.11 110.51 A: yeah th- they're pretty good made for it in this area i know from experience there's not too many [laughter] people qualified technicians around here that work on 'em 

110.29 112.42 B: yeah right that's true 

112.68 117.66 B: yeah it's the it's the going thing so that would definitely be something good 

117.03 125.04 A: i think so a company like hewlett packard and i._b._m. and several of the big companies don't have their own reps any more they contract out 

124.48 125.87 B: yeah yeah 

125.46 127.95 A: and you can work through them and they 

128.64 134.35 A: actually you know they send you out all the calls and then you call in and you 

134.33 144.14 A: know the customer actually tells them what's wrong and they say well it's probably you know this this or this and they send you out there with a part to replace it if it's not that then 

136.70 137.81 B: mhm 

144.43 150.60 A: you know you sort of just replace the parts there is no cost to you for that they ship it off to you 

147.19 148.00 B: yeah 

150.70 151.77 B: wow 

151.44 152.28 A: so 

152.14 157.15 B: that would be a good venture to get into you know especially if you know something about it you know 

157.50 158.76 A: i think so too 

158.78 160.32 B: that's pretty interesting 

160.69 163.16 A: a pretty good demand for it 

162.32 163.34 B: yeah 

163.61 164.47 A: (( oh )) 

163.67 173.82 B: i li- well i like books a lot and i've often thought about ah opening a used book store you know because i frequent one a lot you know it's a second hand bookstore 

174.37 175.50 B: and um 

176.19 181.60 B: you know like i say i just don't know there there's a lot of things that i like a lot of things that i'm interested in 

181.83 184.97 B: um i also do like to do a lot of crafts you know in 

185.48 191.67 B: fact um my daughter and i have just taken belly dancing lessons [laughter] yeah and [laughter] 

189.37 190.31 A: (( really )) 

190.76 192.77 A: i bet that's interesting [laughter] 

192.09 197.92 B: yeah it's just for fun you know well she's twenty one and i'm fifty so it's a big difference but we have a lot of fun 

197.64 198.84 A: yeah 

198.31 203.07 B: but i made us some dancing scarves tonight you know i really enjoy doing stuff like that 

203.78 206.28 B: but you know as as far as ah 

206.46 211.05 B: opening a business i you know i have so many varied interests that i wouldn't even know what i'd 

211.44 214.44 B: what i'd want to do but it is something i've thought about 

214.86 216.27 B: where do you live 

216.25 217.68 A: (( i live in arkansas )) 

217.80 219.53 B: arkansas okay 

219.65 221.18 B: i live in wisconsin 

221.05 223.19 A: oh we are a long ways apart then 

223.04 224.54 B: yeah yeah 

224.69 226.98 B: how's the weather by you pretty nice 

226.91 234.92 A: (( ah it was up until i guess about three o clock this afternoon and we got a thunderstorm that came through and the temperature's dropped about forty degrees )) 

234.72 237.41 B: oh [laughter] that would be a heat wave for us 

237.16 238.61 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

237.71 240.59 B: yeah [laughter] i think we're down in the teens tonight 

240.57 243.59 A: ah this is the coldest weather we've had in this area in quite a while 

243.74 244.94 B: yeah 

244.39 246.04 A: its' and we've got 

246.10 248.58 A: the low hour manual thing going on 

248.65 249.74 B: yeah 

249.03 252.08 A: (( and it's tornados one week and hailstorms the next )) 

251.98 254.36 B: yeah we get that in the summer but ah 

254.55 263.48 B: you know we've never really been hit seriously at least not i'm in milwaukee and we don't usually get hit but outside you know outlying areas usually do 

264.94 267.53 B: (( so um [laughter] i don't know )) 

267.60 272.61 B: um i forgot what other questions we were supposed to talk about with this 

272.45 280.41 A: i think how we were to go about it um i think you know i guess the first thing would be to format a business plan 

280.32 281.85 B: yeah 

280.82 283.43 A: you would have to formulate a business plan in order 

283.79 286.80 A: (( you know to start and then you would present it )) 

286.89 294.43 A: ah you know depending on the type of business i guess you would either need to find somebody to go in with you that could provide the funding or you would have to obtain funding on 

295.29 296.24 B: yeah 

296.00 299.35 A: your own and you would have to find a suitable location for it 

298.78 300.06 B: right right 

299.86 301.44 A: market it 

301.71 307.30 B: yeah and well with money being no object i guess that would take al- a lot of things out of the way 

308.05 310.37 A: (( and unfortunately it's not the case ah )) 

311.09 313.46 B: right yeah that's for sure 

314.40 315.70 A: that would be i 

314.73 318.08 B: i think you would have a good plan with ah the computers you know 

318.50 320.64 A: think so i've thought pretty seriously 

324.29 328.80 A: (( about it it ah since i._b._m. and h._p. have started the contracting out )) 

328.72 329.64 B: yeah 

329.75 334.50 B: could you know anything like about programming or fixing them or all of that 

335.89 339.64 A: (( it ah i throw the things together all the time at work it's what i have to do most of the days is )) 

340.40 342.27 B: wow that's interesting 

341.17 342.62 A: throw them together throw them 

342.59 343.99 B: mhm 

342.65 344.05 A: (( together and repair them )) 

344.11 349.20 A: and um and sell software i can do some programming ah i'm not 

348.24 349.16 B: wow 

349.41 351.08 A: big on the computer 

351.59 352.72 A: (( ah you know the )) 

353.24 355.84 A: languages like r._p._g. and c._o._b._o._l. it's ah or 

356.05 361.22 A: (( you know visual c. that they're programmed in today but you know i can get around and you )) 

359.06 360.35 B: mhm 

361.52 364.48 A: (( know repair minor little stuff or faults )) 

361.57 363.32 B: (( yeah that's pretty good )) 

365.47 370.33 B: jeez did you take cl- schooling for that or did that just kind of come with the job or 

370.64 376.89 A: um i took some classes in it but ah whenever i went to work for a bank that was primarily what i did is ah 

372.29 373.19 B: mhm 

378.07 380.08 A: (( you know worked on their computers and if )) 

380.61 385.12 A: something was wrong i was the person that always had to figure out what it was and it kind of came along 

384.64 387.57 B: wow that's really good 

387.76 392.76 A: naturally then whenever i went to work for an electric utility i became a network administrator and 

392.50 393.53 B: wow 

394.33 398.53 B: so you do have some definite ah advantages to that you know 

399.75 403.35 A: (( ah so i you know i've thought seriously about you know perhaps doing that ah i think there's )) 

403.86 404.69 A: um 

406.95 407.87 A: (( you know there )) 

409.27 413.02 A: the only problem is there's so many of those places that are fly by night 

413.21 417.67 A: i think the biggest conflict you would um come up against would be 

413.81 415.06 B: (( right )) 

418.26 419.52 A: trying to 

420.59 423.07 A: ah convince someone that you were 

423.62 428.19 A: you know really serious in the endeavor that you weren't going to be here today and gone tomorrow 

428.36 429.60 B: mhm 

429.40 435.28 A: (( you know that would be the big thing because i've seen these shops go in and you know they're there six months and then they're gone )) 

435.30 436.40 B: right 

436.33 440.09 A: so i think that would be you know the biggest obstacle you would have to overcome yeah 

440.76 446.32 B: yeah yeah that's that you know this day and age though it sure would be something good to get into 

446.90 449.83 A: and i think that the way to go would be maintenance 

450.23 451.91 B: yeah i i agree 

452.99 458.49 B: even though i mean i know they are getting cheaper and cheaper but a lot of people get attached to their computers and 

458.60 465.49 B: rather than start over with something new they'd rather stick to something like we just bought ah memory for ours you know and a video card 

465.75 468.16 B: so you know my daughter could say well 

465.88 466.71 A: (( oh right )) 

468.32 473.78 B: let's hang in for a better one but actually it was a lot cheaper just to get more memory for it 

473.59 477.55 A: they're getting dirt cheap hallmark actually have a computer now that's ah an 

477.96 479.56 A: (( eight hundred megahertz it's got a hundred and twenty )) 

482.11 484.51 A: (( meg of ram and i think a twenty gig part drive )) 

484.66 488.61 A: with a network card it's just the tower it's not the 

486.77 487.57 B: (( mm )) 

488.73 490.91 A: monitor or the keyboard or the mouse 

491.05 497.31 A: for a hundred and ninety eight dollars and you install the software on it and i mean it's a good computer for a hundred and ninety eight dollars 

492.84 493.72 B: lord 

497.29 500.32 B: (( yeah wow that's amazing )) 

498.29 502.10 A: so i mean it's going to get to the point where people that are building these 

502.25 503.24 B: mhm 

502.95 505.55 A: (( can't afford to build 'em for what they're going to sold at so )) 

505.48 506.89 B: right yeah 

507.54 509.29 B: wow that is a good deal 

508.94 510.23 A: (( it is )) 

510.35 516.40 A: i've thought that if i had to upgrade that's probably what i'd do should go buy a tower and just install the software on it 

516.34 517.26 B: yeah 

519.12 520.00 B: so 

521.28 525.55 B: well i don't know [laughter] i think we've covered pretty much i don't know 

522.93 524.15 A: yeah i don't know 

525.70 528.49 A: i guess there's i don't know if they come back on or not 

528.05 539.22 B: yeah um because my daughter does this and she said they just kind of cut it off she said it usually goes about ten minutes or something like that yeah and she said they just kind of just stop stop you in the middle of it 

534.33 535.15 A: (( oh really )) 

539.72 540.98 B: so i don't know 

542.28 543.44 A: (( oh ah me neither um )) 

544.23 545.93 A: where do you live in wisconsin in 

546.16 547.87 B: ah in milwaukee 

547.70 548.71 A: milwaukee 

548.39 549.44 B: yeah 

549.14 555.82 A: there's a actually a book store that oh i'd say about sixty miles from here that has really become famous 

555.99 561.24 A: in probably in the south john grisham the au- the mystery author 

561.18 562.69 B: oh okay 

561.82 564.75 A: is from this area he grew up near here 

564.47 565.72 B: oh wow 

565.40 571.49 A: and he actually goes to this bookstore for book openings and i mean it is huge whenever he goes over there 

571.50 573.91 A: to ah whenever he has a new book 

573.75 574.91 B: mhm 

574.22 584.08 A: people come from all over they try to get reservations what they'll try to do is reserve so many people for a book signing and of course they get to buy his book when you go in 

584.08 585.11 B: mhm 

584.32 586.86 A: the first edition he autographs it for you 

587.05 599.33 A: and what you have to do whenever this happens is you have to email them at a certain time they'll start like at eleven o clock you can't send an email at ten fifty nine because they won't accept it 

587.09 588.14 B: wow 

599.25 599.96 B: okay
