46.59 48.58 B: [laughter] 

47.81 50.82 A: do you think that you would panic [laughter] 

50.14 51.69 B: well i think i would 

51.72 55.46 B: [laughter] i think i would panic even though i wish i would 

55.79 58.54 B: i would hope i didn't but i know i would 

58.73 60.23 A: what do you think you would do 

60.56 61.44 B: i don't 

60.64 64.39 A: i mean by when you say panic to what extreme 

63.95 65.29 B: i well 

66.84 72.14 B: i think i i panic inside you know i'm like a would you know i would panic from within rather than 

72.15 77.90 B: without you know outside i i kinda keep my emotions bottled up so um 

79.01 84.50 B: you know i guess i would try not i would try not to show it because i never try to show emotion that's me 

85.43 86.32 B: uh 

85.63 88.37 A: how do you think it would affect your day to day life 

88.46 90.64 A: like do you think it you would change 

90.86 92.21 A: things that you do 

91.83 102.63 B: oh no no i don't think that would change um well i mean what do i do i get up i go to work i go and work out and i come home you know maybe go for dinner or something so i don't think that would change 

103.35 105.05 B: 'cause i mean there's nothing 

105.14 107.66 B: there's not that much to change in my life [laughter] 

107.27 108.36 A: right 

108.25 111.60 B: i don't know why would you do you think you would change your life would change or 

111.86 122.40 A: i think so i i think i would avoid i mean i don't know because i don't know what kind of attack it would be but i know with the last one i know that we avoided 

122.85 130.19 A: air travel not because i thought you know i realized that is was more safe than it had been and i used to fly several times a year 

130.35 131.77 A: (( but it )) 

131.79 139.90 A: for some reason it just it it just creeped me out to get on a plane you know what i mean even though i knew logically that is was safer 

140.13 148.31 B: i actually went to in october now that was a month later i went to san diego well actually i flew into vegas 

148.16 149.46 A: did you really 

148.82 159.56 B: well my mother had a conference in san diego and so she asked me to come with her so we flew into vegas and then i drove from vegas to san diego and then back to vegas and then we flew home again 

159.63 160.98 B: and 

161.88 168.25 B: it was we unfortunately we were the one they selected to go through our luggage which was really a hassle 

168.48 169.38 B: (( um )) 

169.65 170.38 B: (( but i )) 

170.89 175.83 B: don't know we felt pretty safe for the most part because you know they really were checking 

175.81 182.22 A: right it was the added security i think i was more worried that somebody on the plane would panic 

182.51 184.06 A: and create 

184.10 186.03 A: a problem you know 

187.21 188.61 B: have you flown at all 

188.55 191.90 A: yeah i have now i have now but it took about a year 

191.92 198.37 A: so but i had a friend who was a pilot for one of the major airlines and he ended up retiring early because 

198.48 201.37 A: he had a few instances 

201.68 210.63 A: of people getting spooked you know if if a bunch of people that get up at the same time you know to check their overhead compartments or something 

210.66 212.57 A: then somebody would just 

213.31 228.02 A: you know get really scared and think that something was going on and that it was a terrorist group you know [laughter] and he said that a couple of times he had his whole flight you know in a panic and the crew was trying to calm everybody down and 

227.94 230.42 A: international flights you know that can be 

231.04 234.08 A: that can be very trying [laughter] so 

232.99 234.94 B: i'm sure yeah well 

234.09 239.46 A: that's what i was worried about more about that than about an actual terrorist you know 

239.92 244.42 A: and i think also i avoided i'm sorry i'm outside so i'm freezing 

244.73 248.98 A: but um i'm in a restaurant so um i also avoided 

249.39 251.60 A: like really crowded places 

251.85 252.83 A: um 

253.49 258.96 A: like i probably wouldn't have gone to the superbowl if i had the opportunity or you know something like that 

258.95 261.62 B: well i didn't think of that but then i guess 

259.08 260.61 A: or a big baseball game 

261.88 263.13 B: things like that aren't 

263.61 267.74 B: you know things that i do normally anyway so i guess i really didn't give that any 

267.71 268.82 A: right 

267.95 269.82 B: you know too much thought 

269.75 275.55 A: well i'm in ohio and we go to a lot of ohio state games and i remember the first ohio state game after 

275.57 277.73 A: the attack people were really 

277.87 279.57 A: i don't know why but 

279.77 281.57 A: they were panic stricken 

281.65 286.04 A: and worried about going to the game because so many people would be in one place at one time 

286.53 288.79 A: and so that was an odd 

289.43 290.47 A: an odd 

290.86 299.80 A: it's something i never would have considered before we had a terrorist attack you know so it is a way that it did change my life [cough] and um 

295.62 296.71 B: yeah well 

299.31 306.65 B: i guess well you hear about it so i wouldn't have considered i wouldn't have thought about it you're right until but then there was so much talk about it so it 

306.82 308.27 A: exactly 

306.87 308.00 B: (( that's interesting )) 

309.64 317.10 A: so i don't know i think it would affect my day to day life possibly depending on and it's all the media you know [lipsmack] 

317.60 319.04 A: depending on um 

319.67 321.89 A: on what kind of attack it was 

322.87 325.99 B: yeah that's true that that probably would change 

326.13 328.22 B: yeah that would change a lot of things [laughter] 

329.11 331.29 A: so if it were an attack on 

331.39 336.64 A: public transportation or something you know well i guess it it has affected me also that 

337.09 338.27 A: [cough] not that 

338.94 340.93 A: i would be taking a a 

340.99 352.46 A: trip on amtrak but i'm not taking one on their right now just because of all the things i've read about that's the right time you do public transportation and trains and 

352.76 356.95 A: so i know that the rate for air attacks are really really low 

357.19 362.52 A: on cross country trips and everything because they want people to you know still ride them 

362.64 366.71 A: but people are um panicking over those reports so 

367.34 369.58 A: it's changed people's lives in that way 

369.63 372.00 B: well i'm going to england next month so 

372.05 373.42 A: are you really 

373.16 376.50 B: [laughter] i don't know if that's a mistake or not i'll find out 

376.37 380.36 A: i don't think you'll be any less safe there than you are here [laughter] 

379.52 383.58 B: no that that's what i think too i don't think it'll make a bit of difference [laughter] 

383.03 384.23 A: no [laughter] 

384.66 389.08 A: so i don't think that tony blair is favored any more than 

389.18 393.22 A: george bush is right now by terrorist groups [laughter] 

393.84 395.59 A: [laughter] so 

395.95 400.33 A: but yeah i think that flying is safer now than it ever has been 

401.16 402.10 A: so 

401.43 405.90 B: why i certainly hope so since i'll [laughter] i'll be going 

404.21 405.58 A: [laughter] 

405.86 407.61 A: how long are you going for 

407.22 408.93 B: i'm just going for five days 

409.50 410.51 B: it's really 

409.87 410.75 A: that'll be 

411.52 412.51 B: it's a very 

411.85 412.52 A: (( nice )) 

412.52 413.90 B: short trip 

413.70 414.83 A: where to 

414.78 415.63 B: um 

415.98 420.35 B: well i'm going well i'm flying to heathrow but um i have a friend in 

420.44 421.74 B: um the mid- 

421.78 425.45 B: i don't know the midlands or something readwich england 

424.98 426.07 A: oh wow 

425.71 427.82 B: so um that's where i'm going 

428.13 429.14 B: i guess 

429.24 430.69 A: it's very nice 

429.38 430.81 B: (( you know i don't )) 

431.14 435.35 B: know i have friends in different areas so um i've met them through via the internet 

435.62 436.72 A: really 

436.08 437.63 B: and uh some 

438.12 443.20 B: there's four people over there one i haven't met yet but three of them i've already met so they've been here 

443.28 448.50 B: so they've been bothering you know really on my case get over here you gotta you know they want 

447.72 448.95 A: [laughter] 

448.74 449.62 B: (( to so )) 

449.76 452.23 B: that's the plan is to go over and you know 

452.57 456.17 B: they want to entertain me but i didn't want to take a lot of time off so 

456.39 457.27 B: (( um )) 

457.31 460.79 B: and my mother's here and she's alone so i don't want to leave her too long either 

461.21 463.13 B: so i figure five days is plenty 

463.47 465.42 A: well that'll be a nice trip 

465.05 467.59 B: i hope so [laughter] 

466.35 476.62 A: [laughter] well they're more experienced at terrorism than we are you know with the i._r._a. and everything in previous years not to the extent you know it's not as 

476.90 480.63 A: big of incidences but you know what i mean 

481.61 488.12 A: they have car bombings and stuff like that where we don't normally have those things you know [laughter] 

487.27 490.32 B: although they don't well they don't talk too much about it um 

490.33 495.93 A: right so they'd probably be a good person to ask you know what i mean like how does it affect your life 

496.61 497.75 A: i don't know 

497.43 498.64 B: oh the people i 

498.98 501.53 B: talk you know i'm friendly with they don't seem 

501.81 503.65 B: to be involved you know they don't 

503.69 507.36 B: although one of them is very dead set against the i._r._a. so um 

507.46 509.94 A: yeah yeah most of 'em are [laughter] 

507.70 508.77 B: he told me 

509.49 519.18 B: well he said to me he won't eat at mcdonalds and i didn't i thought it was because of the food he says no because that's sponsored that's supported by the i._r._a. he says it i mean he's oh 

519.92 521.35 B: i mean you know i'm 

521.36 522.73 B: sorry i like 

523.82 525.45 B: i like mcdonalds 

525.28 526.84 A: [laughter] 

526.21 531.21 B: [laughter] so i never really gave it much thought but boy that was that's a real sore spot with him 

531.76 532.64 B: so 

533.16 536.78 A: i guess that's a way that that terrorism has affected their lives then 

536.89 538.34 B: but that was yeah 

538.46 541.03 B: oh yeah well at a different time right 

540.45 542.58 A: 'cause we wouldn't be thinking about it 

542.50 543.75 B: no you're right 

543.69 548.42 A: but to them it's a reality right where they are you know so 

548.90 550.94 A: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

552.41 554.86 A: [sigh] have we been on ten minutes 

554.47 555.52 B: i don't know 

555.54 556.67 A: [laughter] 

555.63 557.49 B: (( i should have kept watching but )) 

556.95 562.73 A: i don't know what happens i don't know if they're 'cause i thought it was supposed to prod us with different topics 

563.29 570.12 A: but i guess not i don't know if it's supposed to end the call or what [laughter] 

567.97 582.68 B: well i don't remember last night with you know i mean there was some message last night and they said what the topic was and i don't know i couldn't understand him so i don't know if it was the same topic and then last week i was out again and there was a message about another topic 

582.86 587.62 B: and i can't remember what that topic was so i mean i don't know if it's the same 

588.75 589.54 B: (( you know )) 

589.95 592.40 B: for a couple of nights i don't know how this works 

592.85 594.00 A: interesting 

593.11 595.01 B: but it's been different 

594.98 598.11 A: (( [laughter] all right )) 

597.68 599.56 B: i guess we're all set 

599.32 599.89 A: great
