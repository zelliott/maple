3.14 5.21 B: hi i'm cheryl vanderloop 

5.51 6.42 B: um 

5.56 7.00 A: hi where are you calling from 

7.09 9.05 B: monasha wisconsin 

8.70 13.48 A: oh okay i'm in um chicago illinois we're pretty close [laughter] 

11.11 12.03 B: okay 

12.25 14.15 B: yeah not too far 

13.70 17.55 A: okay so um do you want to answer the question first [cough] 

16.70 25.93 B: yeah yeah i guess you know i was thinking i'm not really sure i get the kinda well i don't want to say it depends on the type of attack but i'd have to say with some kind of bomb or something 

26.00 33.81 B: i'd have to say that i think people would probably really panic if it was some type of bomb um i think if it was more discreet 

30.98 31.93 A: right 

33.80 43.88 B: you know like a yeah exactly like if it was bio terrorism they may not really realize what's going on yeah it almost depends on how 

34.58 37.14 A: you didn't have the chance [laughter] 

40.09 42.18 A: what's going on right 

44.27 47.22 B: (( it's done you know the same things )) 

45.65 46.63 A: right 

47.62 55.83 B: if they don't realize what's happening they don't have a chance to to react yeah i mean i don't mean to um take over the conversation i'm just trying to 

50.40 52.35 A: (( to react right sometimes it hard )) 

54.72 56.55 A: (( i haven't done a survey or thing like this before so )) 

57.17 58.25 B: (( [laughter] )) 

59.09 60.94 A: yeah this is my first one too 

60.07 71.38 B: yeah i've tried to think of how to answer some of these questions and you know it makes you wonder in a lot of these things these things are in the back of your mind and kinda wonder about it but um 

63.80 64.77 A: right 

68.21 69.63 A: yeah 

70.56 76.13 A: well i think that um i think the same as you as in terms of panicking you know what i mean if 

74.86 75.88 B: uh-huh 

75.94 89.35 A: there was a terrorist attack i am sure that most people would panic in that situation and in terms of myself i think i probably would too [laughter] although you know it's just because you haven't really you don't know what to expect when you're in that situation so 

89.13 95.14 A: you know you can say you'll keep your cool and you'll think about what you got to do but once you're in there who knows you know 

94.60 95.76 B: (( yeah yeah i know )) 

95.31 96.61 A: (( so mhm )) 

95.97 99.09 B: and then if you get hurt or something in the process 

99.14 102.51 B: well i mean imagine how your adrenalin go- you know what i mean let's 

102.21 103.19 A: (( right )) 

102.61 106.35 B: say if you got hurt even if you know it was just um 

106.66 115.55 B: you know you think of a bombing or something like that and if you just have um cuts or bruises or something like that you see blood or something [laughter] you know what i mean 

112.15 113.07 A: right 

114.95 118.68 A: yeah yeah some people just freak out to that yeah 

116.91 121.26 B: they do yeah it's a scary thing go into shock [laughter] or something 

120.09 121.03 A: (( right )) 

120.86 130.93 A: well you know now that i think about it a little further i think initially i would probably panic to figure out like okay am i going to live or die and how can i get out of this situation 

125.60 126.31 B: (( yeah )) 

128.85 129.75 B: yeah 

130.74 136.15 A: but i think if i was kinda like if i was in the the trade towers or whatever when that happened 

134.76 135.74 B: yeah 

135.94 147.98 A: i mean depending on what kind of physical situation i was in i think i probably would try and help people to get out you know what i mean i think there are some people that panic to the sense where they just run out and you know they're not thinking about anybody 

141.75 143.15 B: oh yeah 

147.85 151.67 A: or helping anybody along the way they just want to save themselves you know 

150.90 151.93 B: right 

151.96 154.67 A: so i think i think i would try and 

151.99 155.28 B: and you're more of you're more of a person that would try and 

154.93 156.07 A: yeah 

155.73 158.65 B: remain a little more calm and try and get people 

158.36 161.21 A: after the initial shock yeah 

158.97 159.79 B: yeah 

160.31 166.52 B: exactly yeah and that is good that you can remain calm like that 'cause i think i'm 

161.80 162.83 A: (( yep )) 

166.81 168.87 B: that way too a little bit where 

168.92 173.91 B: you know if you were kinda assess the situation a little bit more you can kind of say well you know it's 

171.34 172.38 A: mhm 

174.11 187.53 B: hard [lipsmack] to see though too because i didn't realize all the smoke and the um you know where there almost um not the smoke but um [lipsmack] with the ash and stuff like that where they can't see you know you can't you know hardly breathe 

178.60 179.38 A: (( [mn] )) 

183.56 185.19 A: oh yeah in the air 

186.46 187.42 A: right 

187.69 194.26 B: and that's a scary situation too where if you can hardly see where you're going or you know [cough] excuse me can't breathe 

189.61 190.70 A: yeah 

192.42 194.48 A: or breathe yeah 

194.35 198.01 B: that's like jeez you just want to get the heck out of there [laughter] you know 

196.35 206.65 A: right right i well i think your probably your body's natural inclination is to panic when you can't breathe anyway you know that's why so many people probably drown and stuff is 'cause they just panic you know 

205.03 207.86 B: yeah yeah yeah exactly 

207.45 210.68 A: yeah i don't know it would be a tough situation so 

209.87 218.60 B: it would be it's uh hard to say but you would hope that that if you could try and find a way out then you'd you know go back in and try and help people or whatever 

211.38 212.30 A: yeah 

218.05 225.36 A: yeah and hopefully react as calmly as possible just to try and get as many people helped as possible and get yourself out 

225.14 227.39 B: definitely yeah 

225.77 231.44 A: yeah so it seems like the theme for most of the conversations this week have been surrounding 

231.13 232.33 B: (( the the )) 

231.51 233.56 A: you know war and terrorism 

232.51 235.22 B: attacks or something like that 

234.57 239.05 A: yeah yeah i wonder if the study is mostly you know about that 

238.77 240.99 B: yeah 'cause i noticed on 

239.39 240.28 A: uh 

241.02 244.06 B: the website i think they posted um 

244.24 246.58 B: some of the different questions like 

246.65 260.08 B: if you were offered um so much money to leave the country that was kind of an interesting one that would have been interesting to talk about that you know what i mean i mean you could never return or whatever that would have been neat to talk about or 

251.34 252.40 A: mhm 

253.11 254.03 A: yeah 

254.87 257.33 A: [laughter] yeah 

259.71 260.61 A: right 

260.32 262.85 B: whatever you know but yeah i think now i think 

262.92 267.30 B: the concern more is um you know what's going to happen if there's going to be a war or something 

264.19 265.04 A: right 

266.36 271.60 A: with the war and everything what's going to happen to the state of the union happening this week and everything so 

270.71 271.95 B: sure 

271.72 281.53 A: it's well it's a good topic i mean 'cause it gets you kinda thinking of what could happen and in we get a chance to see some of the stuff like the c._n._n. reports when all the uh 

273.57 274.50 B: (( yeah so )) 

281.33 288.41 A: terrorist bombs go off in third world countries or whatever but you know you kinda get to see how they're reacting and the 

284.66 285.46 B: (( to )) 

288.46 301.99 A: situation as it's unfolding so to so to speak yeah and i think that's where i base most of my how would i react 'cause you can't really set your expectations on what it's gonna feel like to be in the situation you know 

291.75 293.13 B: speak that's right 

300.98 302.27 B: i know 

302.35 308.53 B: you know it's such a hard thing to i don't watch a whole lot of the news and um so i don't keep up with it every single day 

304.06 305.06 A: yeah 

305.79 306.74 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

308.81 312.69 B: and um i have a hard time 'cause i i tend to 

312.71 319.08 B: you know like i watch it and i get all nervous about it and so if i stay away from it [laughter] i feel a little bit better 

315.71 316.76 A: yeah 

318.62 319.58 A: yeah 

319.00 327.97 B: 'cause you can't control what's going to happen and if you sit and watch it i don't know i tend to just get too worried about it and um you know 

321.41 322.35 A: right 

325.96 337.94 A: yeah yeah there's a lot of different i mean there's a lot of people that have different views on that i don't think that i would probably watch it as often as i do if it wasn't for my boyfriend who's like a c._n._n. junkie 

337.39 338.38 B: okay 

338.13 347.48 A: so it's always on in the background and stuff and i guess i guess i don't completely focus in on it but i do pick up things just because it's on you know what i mean so 

340.42 341.95 B: sure yeah 

346.81 348.26 B: yeah 

347.52 358.52 A: i'm kind of in the middle i'm not really keeping myself away from it but i'm not in you know diving right in to it and just getting surrounded by whats going to happen in war and all that you know 

358.57 365.09 A: kinda more like well let's see what happens and hope that our our government does the best thing for us you know 

364.74 366.26 B: mm that's right 

366.15 367.94 A: that's all we can do right 

367.14 369.73 B: that's right you just gotta trust them that they know what they're doing 

369.41 372.06 A: right right i was watching uh some 

371.98 381.65 A: some uh debriefing on sea span or something and they were talking to uh rumsfeld and they just kept asking and asking where is the evidence what's the evidence what's the evidence what's the evidence 

381.41 392.10 A: and there's it's so it's funny to watch because he has to be so patient 'cause he doesn't say i already answered that or i'm not going to answer that he actually tries to answer it without really answering the question 

391.55 394.40 B: that's right he's pretty good yeah 

392.21 393.54 A: [laughter] 

393.74 400.04 A: yeah but it's interesting to have that information available if you are the type of person that wants to know about it 

399.42 409.59 B: that's right and it doesn't i mean it's good to listen and watch and at least it is available 'cause it doesn't pay to you know hide your head in the sand you know 

409.12 409.99 A: yeah i 

409.83 411.04 B: 'cause that's not i 

411.27 421.93 B: mean you know you gotta realize that it's part of life you know [laughter] it's out there [laughter] things are going on so you can't just live in your little world and pretend like things aren't you know happening 

412.06 413.73 A: ignorance is bliss 

413.85 415.24 A: right right 

415.84 416.81 A: (( yeah )) 

419.23 420.18 A: right 

421.44 423.98 A: right or that they may not affect you 

423.61 426.22 B: right and i don't have um 

426.50 429.62 B: i really don't i don't have any children or anything but 

428.86 430.33 A: no me neither 

429.65 438.27 B: i do have um you know family members obviously and people that could be affected and you know my boyfriend has a son that's 

435.22 436.24 A: mhm 

438.23 452.43 B: um eighteen and is planning on joining the army [laughter] so you know i mean there's kinda well yeah and you better believe he'll probably end up after basic training you know going somewhere exactly you know so that's kind of a scary thought you know um 

442.45 443.55 A: (( oh )) 

446.52 448.54 A: yeah being shipped out 

448.71 449.85 A: yeah 

450.75 455.68 A: yeah yeah getting ready for that when he did tell you that he was thinking about doing that 

455.27 460.93 B: he [cough] he's been for the past year now well no a little bit before that he wanted to go into the navy and then 

461.10 472.80 B: the army offered him [mn] something so he can be in the i think he was going to be a military police you know like that sort of they offered him as far as a position so that excited him he thought that'd be kind of a neat thing you know so 

466.04 467.28 A: mhm 

471.65 472.97 A: yeah yeah 

472.67 478.57 B: and um but now as of i guess sons are going to graduate like june or whatever you know that 

477.10 478.06 A: uh-huh 

478.39 481.25 A: all the basic training is out of the way in june for him 

480.21 483.88 B: yeah well he has to actually has to graduate high school in june 

483.35 485.88 A: oh wow [laughter] 

484.26 489.25 B: so you know what i mean so then he'll be going into you know basic training exactly yeah exactly 

488.44 500.31 A: well i guess it's kind of a catch twenty two because it's good that at that age he knows kinda he's dedicated to doing something but then you know the flipside is how dangerous it is that you know what could happen mhm 

494.67 495.86 B: yeah 

497.99 499.31 B: exactly 

499.61 503.21 B: yeah and he knows that but well it's good for him so 

503.29 511.95 B: but yeah this is how i mean that that's the world today is so he has to realize what can affect him and everything but that's what he wants to do 

509.44 511.33 A: right right 

511.63 526.62 A: yeah and i think a lot of people as far as like the war thing coming up you know coming down the path or on the horizon and stuff it's just there's always there's a lot of different views on that too because i know that personally my boyfriend is like on this well war will be good for the economy 

526.24 527.21 B: yeah 

526.53 531.34 A: you know and but he's not thinking about like the lives and the you know 

531.38 544.69 A: i don't know it doesn't seem like he's thinking further than just how our economy is going to be affected 'cause there's so many factors that you know factor into a war you know besides that besides how good we gonna 

540.43 542.04 B: mhm that's true 

544.98 550.36 A: make out in terms of this war and you know with things that we have to produce and stuff like that so 

545.50 546.69 B: (( make out yeah )) 

549.65 551.88 B: yeah that's true 

551.52 554.47 A: yeah so mhm 

553.81 554.60 B: but 

554.58 561.37 A: okay i guess we should keep talking about terrorism [laughter] do you know how long the calls are supposed to be mhm 

557.13 559.55 B: yeah [laughter] 

560.64 565.96 B: i don't remember and i know that it said um that it the 

566.25 571.42 B: operator or whatever will come on and say when it's done or it's gonna be done so 

571.59 573.80 B: it'll give us a little warning or whatever 

571.73 574.37 A: to wrap up your call right right 

574.03 579.52 B: but i don't know if it's like fifteen minutes or something like that but that's all right we can talk about um 

576.27 577.80 A: mhm 

579.71 587.11 B: oh like if you like bio terrorism or something like that too if you want i don't know i don't know a whole lot about different kinda things 

582.85 583.92 A: right 

586.51 599.96 A: right right 'cause i know there's like chemical warfare in the bio terrorism and it seems like they're kinda the same thing because it's all like things that you can't see chemical things in the air or they drop bombs that have these 

592.77 594.76 B: that's what i thought yeah
