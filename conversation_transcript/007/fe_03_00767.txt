23.08 24.54 A: yeah uh it depends what 

24.71 27.40 A: she did but if it is a really close friend i probably would 

32.75 37.67 B: i think if you tell a little white lie to save your friend's ass or your family's ass i don't think it is that bad 

39.00 42.98 A: well yeah it is like if it is like your son or something you would definitely want to

45.79 47.11 A: not like wanting to 

46.14 46.66 B: i mean 

47.69 51.50 B: yeah if it's if it is harming anyone else then it is bad but 

51.96 55.02 B: if you are just trying to help your friend or something it is not that bad

87.16 89.72 B: obstructing serious justice i think 

91.28 91.98 A: yeah

197.60 198.87 B: different stuff like that 

201.00 203.72 B: i don't think i don't think there's anything ethically wrong with that

240.37 242.68 A: when they got older they killed uh the guy who beat -em 

242.89 244.76 A: and they told the priest and the priest uh 

245.19 247.04 A: helped -em out do you think that is right 

246.44 246.96 B: oh

254.51 255.93 B: i mean i (( )) though 

256.53 257.79 A: what if you had a kid or something 

258.13 258.61 A: that 

258.97 260.67 A: was like uh 

261.60 263.30 A: freaking molested or something

264.55 267.10 A: you went and you k- no no (( )) 

267.40 269.40 A: he you got older or something and he killed him 

269.56 270.44 A: would you say 

270.56 271.94 A: would you testify against your son 

273.61 274.94 B: um 

275.79 277.87 B: that that is a tough call i mean 

277.97 285.55 B: that that is something where i think the justice department needs to decide they need to find what they think is right by knowing all the facts 

284.04 285.27 A: or like (( )) 

285.65 287.17 A: you just wouldn't testify 

287.49 290.55 B: yeah true i think i think (( )) what would you do 

291.38 293.32 A: i probably wouldn't testify either 

292.87 293.30 B: yeah 

293.88 294.74 B: think that is just 

294.63 297.17 A: or i probably would lie because you know if i like 

297.65 299.68 A: did cover my son and stuff so 

297.78 298.11 B: yeah 

299.40 300.03 B: mhm 

299.92 300.41 A: it is when 

300.51 302.13 A: he deserved it you know 

301.77 302.50 B: yeah 

302.92 306.07 B: well i think i think perjury is also become a bigger issue 

306.45 309.94 B: nowadays with our president clinton lying under oath you know 

308.85 309.47 A: yeah 

310.54 311.06 B: so 

310.92 312.14 A: yeah well people 

311.61 315.17 B: i think i think that kind of took a front line in the media a few years ago 

315.24 318.28 A: but he was just lying for himself though he wasn't lying like you know 

317.10 317.42 B: yeah 

318.48 318.81 B: right 

319.20 324.92 B: well i think i think that was for the good of the american people though i think he it was his personal life 

325.02 328.34 B: and he made a mistake and he tried to cover his own ass 

329.08 331.78 B: and i don't think it hurt anyone by him lying about that 

332.73 335.97 A: yeah and it could have been a research thing that people most people lie 
336.57 337.59 A: like all the time like 

337.73 340.21 A: every like five minutes they at least lie once 

340.24 340.60 B: yeah 

340.37 341.13 A: you know 

341.58 342.45 A: and bill gates just 

342.74 345.07 A: i mean i mean bill clinton just wanted to 

345.99 349.68 A: he did that -cause he was embarrassed he didn't want uh people to know the truth 

350.33 356.30 B: oh if i was the president i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to lead my legacy as the guy who hooked up with a fat intern and 

356.31 357.82 A: yeah 

356.50 356.90 B: (( )) 

357.10 357.66 B: (( ))
