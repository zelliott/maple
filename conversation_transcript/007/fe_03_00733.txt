19.79 23.95 A: i have too i have them coming to my cell phone but they weren't very successful 

24.25 26.41 B: well they came to the answering machine and it was a mess 

26.35 27.23 A: uh huh 

27.32 27.78 B: so 

28.55 32.97 A: let's see how do i feel about terrorism personally i think people would probably panic 

33.05 34.21 B: oh i know i would 

34.55 37.60 A: i know after nine eleven the country was just a mess 

39.02 42.87 B: i was glued to the set and i was panicking here i live in the midwest 

42.68 44.73 A: i do too in wisconsin 

44.73 45.59 B: i live in iowa 

45.60 46.16 A: oh 

46.09 49.62 B: but i grew up by off an air force base so we were always used to 

50.63 52.86 B: you know that that would be the place that would be bombed 

52.67 53.46 A: mhm 

54.30 58.46 A: yeah and i'm not too far away from (( )) that's another one they said they had picked out 

59.51 67.08 B: common i mean you just you just knew every day that it would be if they came it was always the russians you know if they came you would be the ones to go 

64.94 65.55 A: mhm 

66.79 67.48 A: yeah 

67.32 67.83 B: so 

68.09 71.08 A: i just couldn't believe how unprepared we were 

71.20 72.08 B: we still are 

72.07 80.46 A: i i know but then you hear everything on the news about how supposedly these terrorists were trained you know in our country 

80.54 81.00 B: oh yeah 

81.54 83.82 A: and you wonder how it gets that far 

84.36 88.63 B: well but that lady she was turned in was it newsweek she was the woman of the year 

89.26 90.47 B: she was the f._b._i. 

90.76 91.35 A: mhm 

91.05 94.20 B: and she turned she kept telling the her bosses that 

94.86 99.81 B: you know they were here they shouldn't be here they were training on air flights and they wouldn't listen to her 

98.50 99.28 A: mhm 

100.00 109.24 A: yeah exactly well they don't really take too much stock in what women say i don't know if it's you know that we don't pull enough clout politically or what it is 

104.86 105.18 B: no 

109.76 112.77 B: did you see that the workers at ground zero are now getting very sick 

113.25 113.90 A: oh no 

114.24 114.53 B: from 

114.65 115.66 B: respiratory problems 

116.01 116.66 B: metal 

116.77 117.83 B: in their bodies 

117.55 118.16 A: mhm 

118.33 119.33 B: in their lungs and things 

120.34 125.86 A: oh jeeze i know we have some foundries here in town that they have problems with asbestos and things like that that 

125.99 128.22 A: you know uh paralyzes lung 

131.47 132.56 B: well i know i would panic 

132.87 137.53 A: oh yeah definitely me too i mean i have a family and i'd be worried about 

134.13 135.68 B: and like my first thought would be where 

136.16 136.48 B: yeah 

136.70 139.23 B: where are my kids that'd be the first thing i would think about 

138.48 146.84 A: exactly my grandchildren too it'd be like okay now where is everybody i want them here even though i can't do anything i need to know where they are 

143.55 143.89 B: yeah 

146.44 148.15 B: i want to know where everybody is right away 

148.29 151.91 A: exactly and then you'd start thinking about the people that aren't 

152.00 155.63 A: close by that are in your family like i have half brothers that are in alabama 

156.13 158.90 A: you know so even if i felt that i was safe here 

159.29 161.14 A: i would be wondering how they were there 

162.02 163.68 B: did you have anybody close to new york 

164.19 166.62 A: no no thankfully i didn't 

166.50 167.32 B: my sister did 

167.60 168.33 A: oh really 

167.70 168.06 B: but i 

168.49 170.75 B: she um lived there for a little while with some 

171.22 171.60 B: (( )) 

171.93 176.16 B: she was frantically trying to get a hold of them it took two days to get through but they were all safe but 

176.71 177.27 A: mhm 

176.74 178.01 B: no i didn't have anybody there 

178.40 182.08 A: no i was at work when we heard it on the radio and it was like 

182.69 187.75 A: you know that must have been how they felt when they heard orson welles and war of the worlds you're listening to it and thinking 

185.93 188.14 B: i didn't think of that 

188.27 188.72 A: is this 

188.95 194.10 A: even real or you know is this some kind radio scam what would people do if type of thing 

193.73 196.42 B: i didn't think of that that's a really good example 

196.67 203.41 A: because we were listening and then all of a sudden a woman that i worked with she was puerto rican her son had just gone off 

203.74 206.19 A: to be in the marines a few months before that (( )) 

204.85 205.23 B: mhm 

206.47 212.95 A: finished basic training so was on a submarine someplace you know doing some kind of exercise 

230.36 233.28 A: you know when push comes to shove you do 

233.69 235.12 A: and she's like 

235.40 238.35 A: she knew she wasn't going to hear from him for a long time 

238.41 238.89 B: mhm 

239.00 243.34 A: because they weren't able to call home or anything and he had just finished his uh 

243.80 249.44 A: his training probably about two weeks before that he had done the schooling part of it 

249.58 251.87 A: so now he was actually out on field duty 

252.16 260.18 A: and you know and that's got to be awfully hard for those people there you know taking their classes and stuff graduate (( )) and all a sudden it's like 

257.62 258.10 B: yeah 

260.57 263.66 A: we've been attacked you know our country has been attacked 

264.06 268.71 B: but you know you said when push comes to shove you know he would have to maybe that's what we would do too 

268.96 271.31 A: oh definitely you know i know we'd have to 

269.70 272.87 B: you know we'd keep our heads together and we wouldn't panic who knows 

273.26 276.91 A: i don't know that we'd keep our heads together i think we'd go on like automatic pilot 

285.71 286.73 A: until it's done 

287.25 291.72 A: because i've got some belief and i feel that we are only given what we can handle 

291.85 292.32 B: mhm 

292.15 295.08 A: and if god brought us to it god will bring us through it 

295.21 302.07 A: you know and i have to believe that to get through some of the things in my life like we just lost my uncle to leukemia and it 

301.22 302.24 B: oh no young 

302.40 306.81 A: he was only sixty two he hadn't even had a chance to retire yet 

304.47 305.05 B: that's young 

306.41 307.14 B: yeah that's young 

314.90 320.12 A: other people think that he hadn't really started to live yet it depends i guess what generation you're talking to 

320.75 321.68 B: yeah that's a good point 

321.93 323.43 A: see my family is 

323.61 330.91 A: is split because i have i'm married for the second time so i have one daughter that's twenty five one that's twenty one and then a six year old 

332.23 333.13 B: oh my gosh 

332.87 335.95 A: yes so i have to kind of look at the whole spectrum of everything i can't 

335.75 336.13 B: yeah 

336.12 337.92 A: talk to them all you know of course the 

338.03 339.58 A: the same way 

339.24 340.12 B: yeah you're right 

340.22 344.37 A: and my six year old thought well he's really old and i'm like well no he's not 

344.50 348.25 A: you know because that's not much older then your grandmother is 

348.92 356.92 A: and it's hard because my daughter being six is is such a blessing you know it's like getting to do everything all over again at a much more relaxed pace 

353.61 353.88 B: mhm 

357.61 360.70 A: because you don't really sweat the small stuff when you do it over 

360.95 361.64 B: yeah you are right 

362.04 367.59 A: and i have grandchildren five of them and the oldest one is five years old so he and my own 

367.82 369.92 A: daughter are only about a year apart 

370.94 372.21 B: you know when you said that your your 

372.58 373.85 B: when he said that he was old 

374.12 378.51 B: and you know and and talking about this terrorism i remember when my dad he's eighty five and he was telling 

378.66 382.65 B: my kids were talking about nine eleven and he was like this just reminds me of pearl harbor 

382.76 383.38 A: mhm 

383.45 383.93 B: and 

384.22 385.25 B: they were like pearl what 

386.01 387.12 A: yeah exactly 

386.19 395.69 B: they didn't know anything about it and and he he said you know i've been though this panic several time this terror you know there was pearl harbor you know there was the bay of pigs there was a whole bunch of different things 

391.72 392.31 A: mhm 

395.01 396.67 A: oh and the vietnam war too 

396.30 399.56 B: vietnam war yeah and he said and they were like what they're six and eight 

399.90 400.52 A: mhm 

399.98 401.49 B: and so they're they're kind of 

402.82 405.10 B: you know they thought this was the first time ever in the world 

405.22 406.80 B: that anybody had faced something like this 

407.31 412.16 A: it it was the first time in their world you know and that's what we have to relate to 

409.34 410.33 B: yes exactly but 

411.48 413.12 B: but they thought that this had never 

413.25 415.19 B: this big had ever happened before 

415.45 418.39 A: and and there's so many you know innocent questions why 

418.60 427.81 A: and you know that's the hardest one and you can't possible begin to explain it and then you don't know how much you should actually expose them to and how much they should be sheltered from 

418.70 419.06 B: yeah 

428.75 429.37 A: because you 

428.91 432.11 B: well my six year old was building legos of the twin towers 

432.16 433.14 A: ah 

432.22 432.59 B: and then 

432.72 433.71 B: the middle tower 

433.80 435.62 B: the one tower would have red in the middle 

435.69 436.43 A: mhm 

436.36 438.31 B: and then a plane would come and strike it down 

438.51 440.22 A: yeah exactly 

439.22 443.83 B: and then he had another helicopter these were the good people and they would come you know and i was like oh my gosh 

444.44 446.51 B: think they we limited what they saw here but 

446.53 447.07 A: mhm 

447.24 448.50 B: gets out of your hands when they're gone 

448.76 456.59 A: yes see we did too but even at school you know i noticed they had counselors discussing it and trying to explain it to kids because they knew they were going to see it 

451.84 452.58 B: yeah 

456.71 462.41 A: you know on television just like when they've had any big thing like when there was that big slaughter in texas 

463.38 466.10 A: and it was on the news they were trying to explain to kids 

466.65 474.84 A: you know why people would be willing to die for a belief like that which you know we didn't have anything in common with but yet 

470.99 471.32 B: yeah 

475.83 476.61 A: kids 

476.73 482.18 A: you know they get so lost and confused as to what's the point of everything 

479.49 480.18 B: mhm 

481.94 482.29 B: yeah 

482.41 483.44 A: like my little girl 

483.84 487.01 A: and and she's only six she said why do i have to go to school 

488.02 492.73 A: you know we don't even know mama if all these people are alive and i'm like we can't do anything 

493.18 495.75 A: you know to help them personally 

493.62 494.03 B: mhm 

495.90 498.79 A: we have to just pray and we have to just continue 

498.89 505.30 A: you know with our day to day routine i said because she said why does why doesn't everyone go to new york and look 

501.35 501.68 B: yeah 

505.68 508.06 A: i'm like because then people will be getting in the way sweetie 

508.24 509.23 B: yeah that's true 

508.60 520.47 A: you know the ones that are trained to do it are there and they're doing it and the ones that aren't trained like we have to stay behind and just do what we can here in you know spiritual support because there's really nothing we can do we 

519.24 519.52 B: mhm 

523.54 523.97 B: mhm 

523.61 524.50 A: you know as as 

524.82 527.88 A: as much as that sounds like it should be what everybody wanted to do 

528.35 530.43 B: but some people did do that and they were just in the way 

530.50 537.13 A: exactly and if you put too many people in that situation you're going to cause all kinds of you know cave ins and everything else 

531.67 532.89 B: they had to turn them away 

536.50 536.81 B: yeah 

538.28 538.66 B: yeah 

539.46 543.89 A: but yeah it was just so surreal because you were listening to it and it was like 

553.13 556.54 A: for whatever you know kamikaze belief that that pilot may have had 

557.66 561.36 A: it it's ridiculous and when you look in the paper sometimes it says that 

562.00 570.22 A: like there was an article in our local paper about this little boy that used to throw stones at all these jeeps and things like that in the military 

569.95 570.51 B: uh-huh 

570.36 577.31 A: because he was trained that the only honor in his particular country was to die trying to harm americans 

577.49 578.63 B: oh no 

578.73 582.30 A: and little ones take it so personally my little girl why do people hate us 

580.77 581.09 B: yeah 

582.91 586.99 B: that's what my boys say is why do all these people in afghanistan hate us what did we do to them 

587.21 589.67 A: and all we've ever done is support their countries 

589.45 590.24 B: yeah and 

589.81 594.36 A: and that's even hard to understand as an adult why we keep giving it to all these countries 

594.55 595.57 A: i don't know how it is 

595.14 595.97 B: and we (( )) yeah
