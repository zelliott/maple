60.41 61.38 A: okay 

62.81 71.89 B: okay maybe just a small introduction ah um i'm an independent consultant so i work for myself ah independently 

65.12 66.00 A: okay 

68.59 69.47 A: okay 

71.78 79.09 B: and i've thought about starting a business but ah i haven't looked into it seriously yet yeah 

78.64 81.07 A: i am just a stay at home mom 

80.81 81.72 B: oh 

81.49 82.90 A: [laughter] 

81.87 83.47 B: how many kids do you have

90.44 91.26 A: (( [laughter] )) 

91.99 93.99 B: so um have y- so 

94.30 97.54 B: do you have you thought about starting a business at home or 

97.54 102.77 A: i'm trying to actually find a job where i can work at home 

100.96 101.71 B: oh 

102.60 104.07 B: (( yeah i don't yeah )) 

103.51 105.46 A: so a home business 

106.09 110.43 A: would probably be sufficient [laughter] or it'd be a good idea 

108.17 109.32 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

109.79 110.64 B: right 

110.46 113.72 A: but i have no idea how to start how to start one 

113.50 116.31 B: r- oh you mean start a home business or 

115.61 116.77 A: mhm 

116.37 124.07 B: so so w- when you say home business you are y- y- you're referring to working for somebody else right not owning your own business 

124.43 126.36 A: (( um i'm yes )) 

126.58 127.94 A: that's what i'm referring 

126.61 127.40 B: right 

127.67 128.69 B: okay 

128.75 134.24 B: well i- i've no idea [laughter] in that area yeah but um 

130.73 132.43 A: [laughter] 

133.85 137.02 A: i'm assuming the first place to look though would be on the internet 

136.90 143.77 B: but i mean working at home y- y- i mean at least i have heard of of a few so called 

143.80 148.20 B: work at home schemes which i don't know how legitimate those are 

148.35 149.25 A: (( mhm )) 

148.55 153.42 B: so if you are looking for those in the internet i guess you should be a bit careful 

154.09 158.46 A: i know that's what i was thinking it's hard to find something legitimate 

157.62 165.15 B: yeah an- and especially if they ask you to pay for something first and then maybe there's a flak [laughter] 

164.48 165.79 A: that's the ah 

165.56 166.39 B: yeah 

165.83 169.83 A: that's all i've been coming across is um things that i would have to pay for 

169.50 180.13 B: it doesn't make sense right [laughter] yeah i mean unless you are studying for your own business and you had to invest in in the kumons or in in maybe knowledge transfer or something 

171.09 173.16 A: no [laughter] 

179.88 180.78 A: right 

180.18 182.02 B: (( or or a franchise )) 

182.00 182.93 A: mhm 

182.37 186.01 B: i don't know yeah but but what if what if you 

186.11 187.86 B: want to start your own business 

188.34 192.04 A: well i guess the first pl- if i wanted to start my own business 

192.18 197.92 A: the first place i would look is on line probably for government um 

199.82 201.07 A: like funding 

201.14 202.04 B: okay 

201.37 212.36 A: because i know they have a lot of i don't know what you call those things ah grants yeah [laughter] they have a lot of grants out there for certain things so i would look to see if i could find information on that 

204.28 206.25 B: grants yeah 

207.45 208.25 B: right 

211.67 213.14 B: that's interesting 

213.02 214.50 A: [laughter] 

213.68 223.63 B: yeah that's m- why don't why don't you do it i mean there might be something that might fit your skills and and you might even be able to do it at home 

222.99 226.18 A: i know i don't know why i haven't done it [laughter] 

225.21 227.44 B: [laughter] yeah sometimes kids 

226.89 229.33 A: i'm procrastinating i guess it 

228.01 232.07 B: [laughter] [laughter] no with kids around it's sometimes hard i guess 

231.13 232.57 A: is hard 

233.37 236.29 B: um well i don't know [laughter] 

236.03 237.32 A: [laughter] 

236.50 238.94 B: [laughter] ah 

238.93 240.13 A: what would you do 

240.27 246.18 B: ah me actually i've thought of a few things i actually i- ah first of all i'm not married but 

245.68 246.77 A: mhm 

246.20 255.06 B: ah about to in in very soon in a few years and actually i'm looking at some franchises that relate to child tutoring 

255.27 256.30 A: mhm 

255.79 257.60 B: (( have you heard about kumon )) 

257.91 258.71 A: no 

258.45 269.32 B: kumon is like um math tutoring ah franchise obviously is a is a math class but ah the purpose of the class is not is not only to improve 

262.54 263.38 A: okay 

269.52 280.14 B: um just just just like your child sort of catch up with the classes but to go beyond that and then have you have you me- you may you may have seen those um 

280.59 288.97 B: i mean some kids who can just multiply like that i mean you give them two numbers thr- two three digit numbers and they they can multiply like that 

283.83 284.81 A: right 

288.70 289.63 A: right 

288.96 291.59 B: kumon goes into that quite a lot 

291.59 306.11 B: so they teach um sort of tricks and ways to think so it goes beyond just doing math it it goes into thinking and and skills which i think is very helpful so if i can make a business out of it then 

301.02 302.14 A: interesting 

306.35 314.45 B: it's going to be both ah fulfilling and rewarding i guess [laughter] yeah so that's one of the things i'm looking at yeah 

310.42 311.17 A: (( ah-uh )) 

313.92 315.45 A: and how do you spell that 

315.42 323.67 B: k. u. m. o. n. actually i might be able to give you a website hold on one second ah 

324.18 326.76 B: yeah k. u. m. o. n. dot com 

326.66 327.49 A: okay 

327.01 328.38 B: (( kumon yeah )) 

328.18 329.95 A: and it's a math 

329.50 336.91 B: yeah it- it's very much focus on math but um like i was saying is you know so it is used a lot with thinking 

336.61 337.77 A: mhm 

336.95 343.78 B: yeah teaching a child how to think and then how to use i mean the brain so that it is more st- stimulated 

343.29 345.34 A: how did you find out about that just 

344.84 347.40 B: oh i just read in magazines and 

346.85 347.91 A: oh really 

347.61 355.06 B: yeah it- it's like ah it's a franchise i actually read it in ah inc and i ah i. n. c. magazine 

352.11 352.97 A: uh-huh 

354.92 355.87 A: okay 

355.30 362.66 B: yeah they talk about franchising and business opportunities and it's like actually if you want to work at home you might want to pick up 

363.31 366.23 B: another magazine called um entrepreneur 

366.16 367.02 A: uh-huh 

366.55 374.02 B: yeah they have advertisement about working at home ah smart jobs ah that kind of thing yeah 

372.17 373.37 A: really 

373.51 376.82 A: i just i would assume that would have been for like some you know 

376.32 383.81 B: no not really big scale no no [laughter] or you can start with their website entrepreneur dot com yeah 

377.75 379.57 A: yeah [laughter]

421.27 426.39 B: let me look at the email again [laughter] just be ready 

421.52 423.42 A: how much we're supposed to talk 

423.84 425.97 A: okay [laughter] 

431.43 438.93 B: to says in real live conversation have specific specific goals to give and get to get or give information 

438.63 439.56 A: mhm 

440.52 445.37 B: mm there's no specific information you want to give or get [laughter] yeah 

442.94 445.26 A: no no specific in the email so 

445.53 453.52 A: but yeah um the hyp- we were supposed to talk about hypothetically um if we wanted to start our own business and money wasn't an option 

449.18 450.34 B: yes starting 

451.44 458.70 B: so for me would be yeah so m- the kumon thing would be th- the first choice i mean helping you know fr- 

456.94 457.77 A: (( ah huh )) 

457.92 467.72 A: well anything in franchising i think would be would be good like even um they said money was no option so like i would think like a mcdonalds or right 

463.73 464.70 B: yeah 

466.71 472.91 B: but then i mean i- it has to be something that you would be passionate passionate about right but that you 

471.65 477.34 A: right well i like food maybe a chili's restaurant i really like food so [laughter] 

474.17 475.32 B: [laughter] 

475.60 480.03 B: that's good chili's restaurant um mexican please [laughter] 

477.48 478.41 A: yeah 

479.45 483.36 A: chili's you know the hamburgers and pitas and 

482.81 486.51 B: okay so if ah do you include taco bell 

487.13 489.38 A: no i don't like taco bell so 

487.56 492.01 B: (( [laughter] okay you know that's )) 

490.50 494.13 A: maybe del taco but i wouldn't i wouldn't do taco bell 

493.72 494.78 B: okay 

494.31 495.11 A: (( no no )) 

497.12 501.93 A: or like a um or like a store you know like a target store 

501.91 503.01 B: oh 

502.39 506.62 A: you know they said like you know for franchising i don't think they franchise those though 

505.21 507.80 B: no i don't think yeah but you can 

507.99 509.84 B: you can get a seven eleven 

509.80 510.90 A: yeah 

510.32 511.67 B: a bin inn store 

511.38 514.21 A: yeah or out here they call them am pm's so 

511.91 512.72 B: (( oh )) 

513.78 516.87 B: okay i think they're just different chains 

516.59 519.18 A: yeah different same thing different chain [laughter] 

517.22 520.31 B: yeah [laughter] yeah different chains [laughter] 

519.45 521.08 A: they do all the same stuff 

520.57 521.69 B: right 

521.17 525.34 A: but yeah something like that would probably be a good um business 

524.27 533.87 B: yeah actually th- i- that's not for me [laughter] no i i don't see myself owning a s- like a grocery store or a convenience store i 

528.23 528.99 A: no 

533.58 534.37 A: no 

534.14 537.90 B: i i don't know it's just i i think i i want to do something 

538.09 541.28 B: more like the kumon thing really catches 

540.63 542.26 A: more educational 

542.43 546.06 B: sort of um being a bit more beneficial 

545.57 546.77 A: mhm 

546.54 548.41 B: to the children so 

547.72 549.05 A: that makes sense 

548.96 555.18 B: i mean like this is personal choices so but for me if i'm going to go into business i would choose something that is 

551.07 552.02 A: mhm 

555.70 561.97 B: at least a bit useful [sigh] yeah i mean groceries is definitely essential but i mean 

560.52 561.37 A: uh-huh 

562.07 565.27 B: it's not personally fulfilling for me so 

564.10 565.05 A: right 

565.20 568.36 A: see i would be in it to make money [laughter] 

567.87 577.00 B: oh um i would too [laughter] that's what i need to make money money yeah yeah a- are they going to cut us off or 

569.86 571.49 A: [laughter] 

576.63 578.18 A: i'm not sure 

578.23 579.51 A: i don't know 

579.01 584.85 B: and i'm not sure if we hang up now then are we going to be credited or what 

584.23 585.42 A: i don't know 

585.69 589.56 B: [laughter] how long have we been talking five minutes 

589.11 590.60 A: maybe five minutes 

590.02 599.00 B: or more yeah i don't know ah the topic is if you want to start a business okay what are the difficulties i guess one of them 

598.32 599.89 A: well we talked about franchise
