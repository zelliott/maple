321.90 324.14 B: art and community and 

324.43 326.22 B: (( )) and stuff like that but 

326.70 327.17 B: um 

328.09 333.54 B: and you know of course europe i mean you're talking about united states compared to 

333.66 334.36 B: countries 

334.90 339.97 B: in the middle east but compared to europe like and i come from europe so like i immediately 

340.82 349.95 B: uh and i used to live in england before i came here so i didn't come directly from bulgaria you know i've been living in europe for for seven years before i came to the united states

350.59 351.45 B: so 

353.08 353.91 B: it's and it 

354.08 355.76 B: it's making a huge difference 

356.06 356.39 A: it 

357.54 358.32 B: have that 

358.59 361.51 B: background and understanding of 

363.21 365.38 B: so much easier in so many ways

367.09 367.65 B: you know 

367.64 368.11 A: yeah 

368.17 368.98 B: to to 

369.18 370.25 B: and people don't 

370.57 374.06 B: pay so much attention to money or i mean 

374.27 376.27 B: of course money is important everywhere but 

376.73 378.96 B: somehow the work ethics and 

379.45 383.95 B: and how people think and live their lives is different you know it feels like 

384.95 387.20 B: you really live a life rather than just 

390.00 390.66 B: get in to the 

391.29 393.96 B: m- machine money making machine like y- 

394.15 394.41 B: (( )) 

395.35 395.75 B: i mean i've 

397.27 398.46 B: i've felt like 

398.63 400.80 B: everybody here is trying to get 

400.93 401.72 B: money and 

405.77 408.48 B: it's really hard for a lot of people to get it his self 

411.99 412.42 A: yeah 

422.49 422.79 A: yeah 

422.95 426.40 A: of course the united states has more pressure on people to make more money 

426.81 429.90 A: and -cause that's the greater lifestyle and i know a lot of other countries 

430.49 431.29 A: they're not that 

431.41 437.30 A: you know focused on you can still a lead you know a pretty good lifestyle in other countries without as much money 

437.49 437.77 A: but 

437.88 442.88 A: you know uh i think that's just part of the american way you know you have to achieve it you (( gotta )) work your way up to that 

443.40 443.89 B: well 

443.57 445.96 A: and of course there is people that never make it to that point 

446.09 446.55 A: but 

446.80 450.49 B: well a lot of people don't make it it's just an illusion you know because 

457.33 463.68 B: what is this thing that i don't like about the united states you know i mean why is it the american dream and that's all they 

463.80 467.84 B: they they dream about and i think you don't know i mean it 

465.45 465.91 A: yeah 

467.95 474.35 B: the american dream is not so pretty i like to me personally you know i like 

474.48 475.16 B: people 

475.51 482.66 B: achieve something and some comfort and regularity and maybe a regular income to support a house or whatever but 

483.06 484.13 B: they're selling 

485.00 486.22 B: their time their 

486.88 488.86 B: freedom their creativity and 

489.65 490.46 B: um 

492.11 493.05 B: i haven't i mean 

493.20 497.63 B: i i don't know i there are always exceptions but i've never like 

497.76 502.12 B: since i don't know that many people who live this life i i can't even say it for sure but 

503.04 503.79 B: um 

505.01 505.86 B: i i don't 

506.17 509.02 B: think it's very interesting for me personally 

509.17 511.22 A: to live in the united states you don't think is interesting 

510.55 520.77 B: to live in a suburban house and get a job and have two cars and uh a dog or what well you know i mean this kind of thing it just has absolutely no appeal to me so 

512.65 513.29 A: uh-oh 

516.89 517.53 A: yeah 

521.29 521.80 B: i 

522.73 523.91 B: and i think like 

524.05 526.34 B: this is not my dream you know maybe 

526.45 531.01 B: it's the american dream it's definitely not my dream and i feel like a lot of people 

531.84 533.45 B: want to try to achieve this 

533.61 534.06 B: uh 

534.86 536.10 B: they forget about 

536.69 537.83 B: living life and just 

538.03 538.67 B: like have 

538.93 541.15 B: focus on this one goal 

541.62 550.68 B: that is so attractive to them and when finally they achieve it then what you know they live a life in front of the t._v. they go to a two week vacation and you know i mean jus- 

551.75 552.54 B: stuff that 

552.95 553.46 B: isn't 

553.61 555.23 B: so remarkable and 

555.54 556.14 B: and 

556.45 559.35 B: fun and creative and interesting you know 

560.30 560.89 B: so 

561.71 563.10 B: my perspective is 

563.29 566.15 B: like yeah one million dollars i mean
