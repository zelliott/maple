14.42 18.40 A: well i don't know where to begin on that one um 

18.34 19.80 B: well 

18.60 19.29 A: uh 

20.29 28.33 B: what do you think about the uh smallpox vaccine and what they are doing uh to prevent a bio-terrorism attack 

23.74 25.21 A: uh well i 

28.67 38.61 A: i think it's a good idea but i think it should be offered to more than just hospital staff and um you know i feel like it's being offered to just a 

38.84 40.34 A: an elite few 

41.01 42.56 A: and and not 

43.18 49.51 A: other people there's i mean there's so many of us like you and myself we are here and 

49.75 59.63 A: we are not being offered it it's from what i've seen and read about it it's just mostly being offered to hospitals and hospital staff and um 

59.80 63.92 B: yeah i know (( )) um do you feel 

60.09 60.34 A: (( ah )) 

64.03 69.82 B: like you would get it and give it to your children if you have children or your family members 

70.45 74.38 A: i i feel like it ought to be offered to all of our family members 

74.63 75.19 B: yeah 

74.76 79.77 A: (( )) but then again you stop and say what good would it do also because you 

80.62 83.83 A: if he finds out we all vaccinated ourselves against 

84.39 87.57 A: smallpox there's there is just going to be something else around the corner 

87.46 90.46 B: right do you feel like um 

90.63 93.44 B: there is basically uh 

93.57 96.59 B: there is n- no way of preventing something 

96.84 98.33 B: of like bio-terrorism 

99.33 104.97 A: uh it is kind of scary to think about but in a way you know you stop and think that 

105.52 114.72 A: there is a possibility that there is no way to stop him because every way you turn they are always coming up with something new they are coming up with 

115.33 120.65 A: new ways to bomb us new ways to i mean they were talking about a microwave bomb 

120.76 121.41 B: right 

121.74 130.32 A: the other day and then they were talking about all these little suitcase bombs and then what so scary is the stuff that was bought for the u._s. 

130.64 133.71 A: is somehow fallen in to the wrong hands 

134.51 135.01 B: mhm 

134.61 135.04 A: so you 

135.29 137.90 A: you stop and wonder should the u._s. even have it 

138.54 139.63 A: in the beginning 

148.61 149.19 A: you know (( the )) 

148.77 149.86 B: because we have uh a 

150.00 153.13 B: you know like we have smallpox 

153.91 154.89 A: -cause there is always 

154.14 154.64 B: yeah 

155.03 158.14 A: there is always someone out there that is willing to pay the 

158.34 159.91 A: the big mega bucks 

160.23 166.75 A: whatever it takes to get it and then there is a person here in the u._s. that is willing to accept that 

166.90 167.87 A: that payment 

168.43 169.13 A: to give up 

169.28 170.56 A: whatever they have 

170.44 178.49 B: right like who knows who gave up that anthrax i mean it probably came from another country but who knows if um if it was someone just 

178.58 183.72 B: who got paid a lot of money to give up their secret and how to make it and things like that you know 

183.40 183.68 A: (( mhm )) 

204.18 206.13 A: and i feel like it all goes back to 

206.99 212.45 A: we should have destroyed saddam and all of them when we had the chance and we didn't do it 

212.65 214.01 A: it's just been it 

214.26 216.49 A: excuse my language pussy footed around 

216.73 217.39 B: mhm 

216.87 221.70 A: over the last several years and it's just gotten increasingly worse and 

221.92 224.62 A: no one is willing to work with the u._s. really 

225.07 232.95 A: they say they will we threaten them all we want to but they have something we want we have something they want and it is a constant never ending thing 

234.12 234.51 A: (( that's )) 

237.91 245.89 B: um do you think we should like go to war and prevent all these people if we have enough evidence from 

245.99 247.17 B: you know basically 

247.57 249.53 B: being in in power 

250.18 250.80 A: uh 

251.04 252.64 A: i don't know if that would help 

252.77 257.51 A: really i mean it's it's kind of hard to say that that would help um 

264.86 274.10 A: that terrorist or another country won't there's al- and we are not willing to freely give it to -em there is always going to be some type of 

274.71 276.12 A: conflict and 

276.48 281.29 A: they are going to want us you know they are going to do something to justify them getting what we have 

281.65 282.10 B: hm 

282.80 283.44 A: i i just 

290.86 295.09 A: um you know talks of wars over this reason and that reason for 

295.95 299.88 A: this one has this kind of bomb this one has this and it's 

300.06 302.46 A: you know it's just getting increasingly worse 

302.90 303.39 A: and i 

303.00 303.49 B: right 

303.94 308.40 A: i feel like if so many of the presidents had not in fu- in the past had not 

309.17 310.59 A: dally dallied around 

311.03 311.80 A: maybe 

312.40 314.22 A: we could have taken care of -em 

314.55 319.15 A: and not been faced with what we are faced with now and all the threats that we are faced with now 

319.44 320.03 B: right 

321.21 324.82 B: so i don't know i don't know if there is any way to prevent 

325.44 326.61 B: what will happen 

325.47 327.63 A: i don't either if i don't 

327.10 332.46 B: there is just no way to prevent people from getting sick i guess and finding all all of the 

331.93 332.55 A: yeah 

332.78 334.29 B: things that people are going to get sick 

334.97 337.75 A: just if like no matter what you do to try to prevent it 

335.34 335.84 B: (( uh )) 

338.41 341.05 A: someone else comes up with another way to 

355.80 359.83 A: you're like okay you should of thought about it 

357.89 358.59 B: right 

359.97 360.52 A: you know 

360.93 363.49 A: the possibility of of that occurring 

363.77 364.27 B: right 

363.92 364.45 A: right 

370.07 370.66 B: mhm 

376.08 376.41 A: for 

376.60 379.45 A: other things but i think things have just gotten so advanced 

388.80 389.62 B: right 

394.73 403.35 A: it's not actual terrorists i think it's just copy cat people that are infuriated with america for whatever reason it could be an american that 

404.04 405.56 A: who is just ticked off because 

405.80 408.25 A: he feels he didn't get his fair share or his 

408.41 408.94 A: you know 

423.74 431.82 B: say they can basically invade your privacy as far as i'm concerned but you know they will tap into your email or whatever and 

432.01 433.01 B: y- you know 

433.02 433.68 A: well 

433.24 437.37 B: check on you and monitor you and maybe they could 

436.56 438.84 A: like they are saying big brother is always watching you 

438.97 440.79 B: right they could just 

450.47 452.71 A: to senates and congress and 

456.46 461.27 A: actually following the rules that they need to be following they are doing things that they shouldn't be doing 

461.60 462.26 B: right 

461.90 462.33 A: and 

462.64 466.70 A: and because they are doing the things the people who are at home that are doing the correct 

466.79 467.28 A: things 

467.69 469.73 A: end up being spied on too so uh 

474.39 476.57 A: you know can use your references and stuff 

476.88 477.16 A: it 

477.85 480.15 A: everything that we do i feel 

480.43 481.09 A: is 

481.32 484.96 A: watched and copied and and you know 

485.59 487.44 A: checked on 

485.63 486.20 B: mhm 

487.07 487.65 B: okay 

500.93 506.71 A: look at how new york has so many cameras every street corner is basically you know 

506.54 507.60 B: right 

507.06 507.95 A: checked on 

508.10 511.26 B: i'm from a a bigger city so i know 

511.36 512.72 B: it uh yeah 

519.38 519.98 B: mhm
