31.11 33.73 A: well in any case i don't know about you but i have 

33.85 36.68 A: a child uh he is a grown-up but i would 

36.91 39.36 A: you know being a mother i would definitely 

39.50 40.11 A: you know commit 

40.30 41.95 A: perjury i'd i'd kill for my child 

42.07 48.66 A: that is just the way i i feel i know it is wrong and unethical and whatever but you know i don't know if i would do it for a close 

49.20 50.13 A: friend or something 

50.35 56.82 B: yeah i well see i know it is so funny that you would say that because they called me on this topic already and i already uh was 

57.04 59.92 B: thinking that you know as soon as they said that i was 

60.08 60.58 B: thinking 

60.93 63.82 B: the same as you but when i when the other person 

63.98 64.24 B: spoke 

64.42 64.88 B: first 

65.49 67.51 B: i told them you know it says um 

67.96 69.58 B: depends on the situation 

70.01 75.82 B: you know what i'm saying because let's say um a family member even your husband or even your child 

70.83 71.37 A: mhm 

76.33 78.58 B: killed somebody though you see what i'm saying 

78.40 78.83 A: yeah 

79.16 84.23 B: if just really just depends on the situation that they are referring to i think 

83.93 86.43 A: oh yeah well uh i mean uh and that is the whole point that 

86.75 87.13 A: you know 

87.31 88.19 A: it it is the sit- 

88.35 90.02 A: situation ethics 

89.70 90.34 B: yeah 

90.19 91.54 A: i mean i uh that is 

91.82 94.48 A: what i think the whole point is that 

95.23 96.53 A: you know like you say if they 

96.62 97.93 A: killed somebody 

98.91 99.48 B: then they could 

99.71 101.76 A: yeah then then then you might if it was 

99.74 100.62 B: do it again 

102.26 106.76 A: yeah if if they just went out and killed somebody for no reason as opposed to uh you know like 

106.33 107.33 B: self defense 

107.11 108.67 A: self defense or 

108.77 113.24 A: you know or or it being an accident or or something like that you would definitely 

114.20 116.97 A: that that would definitely factor into it um 

118.27 118.65 A: because 

118.81 125.57 A: you know i i don't i know some people who think in absolutes that they would absolutely never do this or absolutely never do that um 

125.93 126.89 A: a- again if 

128.31 129.04 A: it you know like 

129.54 134.11 A: a case with say testifying against somebody in the mafia if your family was threatened 

134.36 136.22 B: yeah i know yeah right 

134.47 134.90 A: you know 

135.45 136.01 A: i mean 

136.31 138.08 A: uh to me that is the no brainer 

138.40 139.22 B: i know 

139.11 143.03 A: you know where not not saying mafia but just any criminal you know 

143.78 147.34 A: type situation it and that is what it is situational if it was just 

143.81 144.46 B: yeah 

147.59 154.48 A: i mean i know i've seen accidents before and i've you know called the police or whatever but you know there hasn't been any sort of threats 

155.03 155.49 B: right 

155.40 156.83 A: ei- either perceived or 

157.06 157.48 A: you know 

157.84 158.44 A: real 

158.98 159.97 B: right right 

160.60 163.54 B: yeah it's i know it's just the well 

164.10 167.76 B: you know what the situation they are talking about because you are right if they talk about 

168.24 177.79 B: even not even a crime like every day situations everybody does you don't say like if you have children you said i have children too i mean you know everybody is going to 

178.31 180.79 B: try to stick up for the person they love or you know 

180.36 181.04 A: oh yeah 

181.19 185.47 B: i not so much friends though i i don't think i would find myself um 

186.28 186.71 B: really 

186.84 187.49 B: do with i would 

187.58 188.30 B: friends 

188.41 189.20 B: but you are right with 

189.44 191.45 B: husband or children yeah 

191.03 191.53 A: mhm 

192.81 193.38 B: you know 

198.62 205.72 A: when they say perjury i'm thinking of like in a court of law type situation you know if it was just a situation where 

201.71 202.89 B: that is what i'm thinking 

206.42 211.04 A: you know where it was just like lying uh about a friend or not to hurt somebody's feelings well that 

211.27 211.91 A: you know 

211.30 211.55 B: that is 

211.66 213.40 B: different oh yeah right right 

212.32 212.77 A: yeah 

214.20 216.95 B: figure they probably are talking about in the court of law 

217.01 217.61 A: right 

217.05 218.44 B: yeah right right 

223.49 224.19 B: i think it would 

224.49 225.21 B: with me it would 

225.31 226.67 B: depend on the situation 

226.63 227.51 A: oh definitely 

227.10 228.18 B: you know i mean 

229.07 229.51 B: i 

230.03 232.68 B: you know i like if they stole something then 

232.95 235.79 B: maybe i would deny that they did it you know 

235.96 236.53 A: mhm 

237.70 240.60 A: yeah well i i i know what you mean if it if it was something that 

240.93 242.35 A: it would depend on whether it was 

242.69 246.93 A: a like if it hurt a person or if it was just you know 

254.09 254.43 A: murder 

254.82 255.39 B: right 

254.94 256.97 A: (( )) isn't the same as driving drunk or 

257.08 259.66 A: you know whatever so it would depend on a 

261.06 262.91 A: the whole situation if 

263.43 264.85 A: you know i mean i i think i'd 

265.29 267.63 A: an my son is twenty seven and like 

267.82 275.09 A: you know a foot taller than me but i probably would smack or something if he if he did shoplifting or something like that or you know 

275.24 278.81 A: you got nasty to his wife or whatever but at the same time 

279.23 279.67 A: you know 

282.08 283.08 A: you know i i don't 

283.52 284.39 A: i don't know that i'd 

284.52 285.82 A: uh you know necessarily 

286.07 286.90 A: you know 

287.09 290.84 A: testify against him or you know say he was with me or whatever 

289.04 289.81 B: yeah right 

290.88 300.18 B: yeah i don't think anybody really would you know if you think about it unless you have a close relationship maybe but oh they are asking if the person is close to you is the question you know 

294.06 294.35 A: oh 

296.88 297.40 A: yeah 

299.89 300.44 A: right 

300.92 301.32 B: yeah 

301.00 302.58 A: right so that that is a given 

304.85 306.09 A: you know i i said well 

306.23 308.18 A: of course any parent would be that way but i know that 

308.34 311.57 A: there's a lot of parents that are estranged from their kids and 

311.73 312.24 A: and i would 

313.12 313.62 A: um 

315.58 316.53 A: um (( whachama )) call it 

316.75 317.17 A: you know 

317.91 318.63 A: m- would want to 

318.78 321.42 A: teach them a lesson or figure that they deserve it but 

322.32 323.72 A: you know but i think again that is 

324.86 325.34 A: sort of 

326.33 329.00 A: well i i guess it is situational you know i mean 

329.12 330.30 A: the for me personally 

330.71 331.20 B: right 

331.80 334.91 A: that that is what i'd do and i guess that is what they are asking 

335.08 338.55 B: right right yeah i have uh three boys also 

339.34 344.52 B: they are like you know they are young i have a six a five and a little a baby a four month old 

346.51 348.05 B: with uh what do you have one son 

346.56 347.31 A: so 

348.20 350.09 A: yeah j- just the one son he is he is 

349.43 350.05 B: oh 

350.20 352.37 A: twenty seven and married and lives 

352.89 356.07 A: you know nine hours away so i don't even get to see him that much but 

356.01 358.20 B: i can't even imagine that at this point you know 

357.85 358.71 A: oh no 

358.33 362.02 B: when they are so little you can't imagine ever being separated 

361.91 366.82 A: yeah when fortunately or unfortunately ever since he went away to college it has been that 

367.90 368.44 B: yeah 

367.96 370.03 A: you know he he has been far away at least 

370.14 371.31 A: six hours away although 

371.46 371.87 A: when he was 

372.17 376.82 A: first out of college his job was only three hours away but he they just moved (( )) 

376.56 377.09 B: oh 

376.98 378.12 A: but it you know 

378.31 380.84 A: but you know it it is still the same i mean 

380.82 383.05 B: yeah (( )) a child i know 

380.96 381.80 A: they are still your 

382.14 383.08 A: your baby 

384.27 387.49 A: and you know i i'd still do anything for him 

387.92 388.54 B: right 

388.32 390.97 A: and you know he used to be embarrassed about me calling 

392.09 396.57 A: m- calling him my baby but then i i told him i could remember when i was 
397.01 400.05 A: when i was a teenager my dad was in his fifties and we went to visit 

400.23 400.49 A: my 

400.67 401.84 A: dad's mother 

402.27 405.91 A: who was in a nursing home and she my dad was a grandfather by then 

406.02 406.48 B: yeah 

406.48 408.95 A: and she was introducing him to her 

409.35 409.67 A: you know 

409.81 412.06 A: mates at the nursing home and 

412.30 420.83 A: as her baby so i told my son if grandpa could be somebody's baby so could you right 

417.39 424.13 B: yeah right and that is me i'm always the baby -cause i was the youngest one out of four you know 

422.57 422.97 A: (( )) 

423.49 423.99 A: uh-huh 

425.26 426.13 A: but 

426.27 429.31 A: but yeah you know i mean i think what 

429.53 430.95 A: i think we are kind of in agreement 

431.14 432.86 A: that it just depends on the 

432.89 433.79 B: i i know 

433.25 437.83 A: the situation and that that i think is the whole point of the question situational ethics 

437.85 438.36 B: yeah 

438.19 438.62 A: you know 

438.59 442.50 B: but i think uh i know like we are used to just saying yeah we would 

442.81 444.97 B: it is terrible i know 

444.65 445.46 A: yeah 

445.52 448.36 B: but i think we need to just keep talking like see what happened before is 

448.77 450.80 B: the machine came on and it said something like 

451.37 452.63 B: say goodbye and then press 

452.77 453.30 B: one 

453.48 453.96 A: uh-huh 

453.61 454.67 B: and i think once you press 

454.82 456.32 B: one then it records that you 

456.43 457.36 B: spoke the whole 

457.48 459.63 B: and it is supposed to beep in ten minutes you know 

459.21 461.75 A: oh is it okay i i've forgotten yeah -cause the 

461.92 465.58 A: what happened was the first time i got a phone call and they said to 

466.05 474.22 A: it didn't go this far as to you know will you accept the call what is your pin or whatever and it just like you know five minutes later i was still 

474.49 480.47 A: hanging on the phone n- not that i was hanging on the phone i was sitting at the computer so it was like it didn't really bother me that i was hanging on the phone 

480.64 482.08 A: but then the next 

482.32 485.06 A: couple of times i i missed the call i you know was 

485.52 488.79 A: outside or walking the dogs or something like that 

489.43 493.99 B: yeah so i i know -cause i kept seeing it on my answering machine too and they called already now like 

494.48 496.19 B: they called like three times and i talked 

496.39 498.99 B: for two times but i didn't know you had to wait 

498.64 499.76 A: oh okay 

499.26 501.28 B: so now uh just once i called so 

501.68 504.77 B: but i think you get ten dollars for every time you talk it said 

504.71 508.08 A: yeah i'm i'm not exactly sure i just thought it would be an interesting 

509.10 509.68 B: yeah 

509.41 511.03 A: ex- experience um 

511.98 514.00 B: did you sign up online for it or 

513.67 514.07 A: yes 

515.28 518.74 A: yeah i i found it i forget one of the newsgroups i'm in or 

518.92 520.51 A: you know i'm i'm just the type 

520.62 524.66 A: person when i was in college i used to take part in studies and surveys just 

524.77 526.17 A: you know i mean we were paid like 

526.38 528.93 A: a buck or something like that but it was just interesting 

529.10 530.17 B: yeah yeah 

530.74 532.10 B: i do the focus groups 

532.25 534.77 B: uh you know i do focus groups and stuff like that
