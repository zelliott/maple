3.94 5.46 B: my name is beth 

5.68 9.07 A: (( hi that's a really rude topic that they gave us )) 

6.17 7.14 B: hi 

8.03 12.20 B: [laughter] i know i thought it would be i thought it would be about you know 

9.89 11.01 A: would you ever 

12.30 16.17 B: friends s- some kind of social topic and we're talking about perjury 

16.03 21.76 A: perjury i guess it's just they want to understand how people converse to some end 

16.96 17.84 B: (( oh )) 

21.47 22.66 B: right 

22.13 23.24 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

23.07 27.46 B: okay so would you commit perjury for a friend or family member 

24.73 26.22 A: would you ever commit 

26.33 27.49 A: perjury 

27.66 29.96 A: automatically i say no 

29.73 30.63 B: right 

30.07 34.03 A: but i understand it would be different in the situation you know what i mean 

33.84 34.94 B: i agree 

35.06 36.59 A: is that what you think too 

35.78 41.34 B: it's definitely what i think you know if if something happened or your child or your husband or someone 

41.41 42.63 B: did something 

41.66 42.74 A: right 

42.64 44.29 B: it wouldn't be a 

42.97 44.14 A: right 

44.75 46.33 B: very good situation 

46.49 47.58 A: yeah 

47.01 47.87 B: so 

48.14 50.80 A: i don't know i guess it comes down to 

50.95 56.73 A: it's illegal kind of but it comes down to i guess what you would feel right doing morally 

56.17 57.17 B: right 

57.27 61.85 A: i don't know [laughter] it's really tough i'm sure you've been in a situation before where 

61.94 66.20 A: it's not it wasn't in a court of law or anything but it was like 

66.31 74.03 A: a situation where say you're in school or in you know you know somebody cheated and you know you're a you're the witness but they're your friend or something like that 

73.35 74.31 B: right 

74.56 75.42 A: so 

75.29 76.59 B: that would be 

77.20 78.24 B: difficult 

78.69 79.84 A: yeah 

78.82 83.36 B: yeah if it came down to a court of law i'm not sure that i would 

83.47 84.95 B: be able 

85.45 89.18 B: i probably wouldn't do perjury but other situations 

89.56 91.21 B: (( i mean what are they going to do you )) 

91.30 92.11 B: so 

92.37 93.33 A: right 

93.60 94.31 B: hm 

95.02 96.14 A: [laughter] 

95.14 97.15 B: okay [laughter] 

98.83 100.88 A: (( yeah so [cough] tell me )) 

99.91 104.11 B: how long do we keep this conversation going on perjury 

103.79 107.10 A: ten minutes i'm sure they tell us when ten minutes is up 

104.60 105.52 B: (( [laughter] )) 

106.63 109.53 B: okay perjury um well 

109.08 119.76 A: i don't know i guess what it comes down to is you have to do what you think is right you know what i mean if you're doing it to help somebody else out in the end you're still going to have to live with yourself and that might be selfish like you 

113.08 114.08 B: right 

119.53 128.61 A: that might be the line between you sending someone you love to jail or not but in the end they did something wrong and it's not up to you to 

128.70 135.39 A: to keep them from that i guess so i would probably just tell the truth like i wouldn't go out of my way 

135.75 141.39 A: to you know say a whole lot of things that i wasn't asked directly maybe but i'd just answer honestly 

139.34 140.36 B: right 

141.23 142.23 B: um 

142.31 146.88 B: the only thing is when it comes down to a friend or family member and you know the person personally 

146.87 147.79 A: yeah 

147.08 148.46 B: do you 

149.28 155.90 B: and let's say it was one incident that they you know could re- go to jail for a very long time for 

156.18 158.21 B: but you know that the person 

158.68 160.43 B: you know it was one incident 

160.51 161.46 B: um 

160.79 162.32 A: mhm 

162.53 165.19 B: i don't know that i could actually send the person 

165.50 166.59 B: to jail 

166.93 167.80 B: so 

167.39 175.16 A: yeah i feel like it's a different situation whether it's a minor offence or say a murder or homicide 

174.14 178.50 B: right a murder or homicide okay th- those could injure other people 

178.83 183.01 A: you'd be sending them to jail for a longer time but at the same time they must have done something 

183.56 187.71 A: much more wrong to have deserved you know [cough] [mn] 

186.75 187.54 B: right 

189.28 190.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

190.84 193.63 B: well i just looked up perjury on the internet 

193.53 194.73 A: [laughter] did you 

194.49 198.08 B: and ah we could talk about let's see monica lewinsky 

198.59 203.22 A: oh yeah [laughter] we could talk about clinton [laughter] 

203.37 204.83 B: or clinton or 

204.87 207.82 B: there are all kinds of books wow 

209.11 215.31 A: well clinton basically just made up his own definition of sex to answer the questions with like i didn't lie [laughter] 

214.22 216.13 B: that was him just saying 

215.99 217.16 A: (( [laughter] i know )) 

217.83 222.59 B: i've never seen anyone who could just stretch the truth so much 

222.62 224.02 A: yeah 

225.39 228.06 B: well here's the legal definition of perjury 

227.89 229.36 A: what is it 

228.78 230.66 B: um okay 

232.88 245.91 B: when a person having taken an oath before a competent tribunal officer or person in any case in which a law of the u._s. authorizes an oath to be administered that he will testify declare depose or certify truly 

246.27 249.84 B: or that any written testimony declaration deposition 

250.17 252.15 B: or certificate by him 

252.28 264.01 B: subscribed as true willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes in a material matter which he does not believe to be true or any [laughter] declaration certificate verification or or statement under penalty of perjury 

263.85 270.77 B: willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true which he believes are part of the u._s. code 

271.12 272.55 B: that sounds like it 

271.51 272.15 A: (( uh )) 

273.40 275.19 A: yeah 

274.91 275.76 B: wow 

276.32 277.38 A: [laughter] 

278.86 283.61 A: ah i think the problem is when you get up in front of [laughter] a court room 

282.99 284.04 B: right 

283.97 293.38 A: it's still that's legally right or maybe in the case of marriage you know there's even an exemption you shouldn't have to testify against your spouse i believe 

293.73 298.48 A: so it actually comes down to which side's more sacred to you your marriage vows [laughter] or 

299.23 300.97 A: or the laws of the u._s. 

301.10 303.23 A: it's actually funny which comes first [laughter] 

303.36 307.88 B: um actually in some cases you don't get spousal immunity 

308.01 309.09 A: (( mm )) 

308.58 313.78 B: so that that could be really hard i don't know what those cases are thought 

314.91 315.90 B: um 

318.71 319.45 B: hm 

319.80 320.65 B: wow 

321.38 322.71 B: (( [mn] )) 

322.50 324.11 A: such a strange question i 

323.59 325.81 B: it is really strange 

327.30 329.32 B: not at all what i expected 

329.91 332.84 A: know and it's only been four minutes [laughter] 

331.79 333.13 B: are you serious 

333.25 334.53 A: i think so 

333.86 337.52 B: [laughter] we have what two more of these that we could possibly get 

336.92 340.41 A: uh-huh yeah hopefully it would um 

341.10 343.15 A: spin a little more conversation 

342.73 344.21 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

344.63 345.75 B: um 

347.16 350.77 B: each call i'm trying to see what the rules are 

352.20 355.71 A: you're just supposed to talk on the topic as long as you can 

355.73 357.27 A: for ten minutes 

359.74 361.42 B: okay 

362.98 363.79 B: (( perjury )) 

365.62 368.11 B: you know what i feel like i feel like i'm in ah 

368.19 370.38 B: back in school where you had to speak 

370.76 372.28 B: in speech class 

372.27 373.28 A: yeah 

372.72 376.02 B: on some topic that was drawn out of a hat 

375.98 376.88 A: uh-huh 

377.87 378.74 B: (( oh well )) 

378.67 383.31 A: you're supposed to speak for four minutes which when you're giving a speech seems like forever [sigh] 

382.56 384.09 B: yeah 

386.30 387.33 B: okay 

386.40 387.42 A: (( mm )) 

388.17 389.76 B: so perjury 

389.81 391.14 A: (( [laughter] perjury )) 

390.94 393.20 B: i- i think we've covered it 

393.57 394.76 A: [laughter] 

396.88 397.93 B: (( [sigh] )) 

399.10 402.41 A: i don't i don't know much i don't know 

402.49 407.46 A: too many legal terms i [laughter] don't know very much about the law it's hard to say more than that 

412.33 415.51 A: i wonder if they mean in a legal sense you know 

415.77 416.88 B: right 

417.38 418.64 B: um 

424.35 425.94 B: oh this is interesting 

426.34 427.51 A: (( what )) 

426.97 429.04 B: i guess clinton had read this one 

429.65 430.77 B: um 

433.66 434.43 B: hm 

434.71 439.55 B: so perjury is a felony punishable with incarceration in prison okay we knew that 

439.23 440.18 A: mhm 

439.83 440.99 B: um 

441.93 445.75 B: the u._s. supreme court strongly uphold the principle that 

446.94 451.16 B: if a witness tells the truth and no crime of perjury has been committed 

451.44 454.58 B: in juan still versus the united states 

455.25 464.68 B: they ruled that the u._s. supreme court ruled that even if a witness answers a question in a misleading way as long as the answer is literally true perjury has not been committed 

464.39 465.25 A: yeah 

464.97 472.99 B: and what happened was the guy um the witness was asked if he had ever had bank accounts in switzerland and he said his company did 

473.34 479.65 B: because his answer concealed the fact that he had had bank accounts in switzerland the prosecutor prosecuted him for perjury 

479.69 480.60 A: huh 

480.02 485.89 B: and the supreme court said that since he had not actually lied he had not committed perjury 

485.89 486.97 A: right 

489.82 498.62 A: [sigh] that seems wrong though because wh- socially if you were withholding the truth or misleading someone about the truth it's the same thing [laughter] 

498.28 499.24 B: mhm 

499.31 507.03 B: i don't understand why his at- why the attorney he was questioning didn't follow up with well did you yourself 

505.38 506.07 A: right 

506.88 510.37 A: did you personally outside of your business right 

511.14 512.04 B: 'course 

512.22 514.78 B: i'm sure they had reasons for their 

515.26 518.33 B: prosecution that we of course wouldn't understand 

517.07 525.78 A: right like instead of getting an actual answer he would rather discredit the witness later maybe the witness was hurting them too much something like that 

526.92 528.07 B: definitely 

527.39 528.27 A: (( i don't know )) 

529.00 530.13 B: (( all right )) 

530.26 534.85 B: i no longer work at law firms so i thought i didn't have to deal with this stuff any more 

532.76 533.59 A: [laughter] 

535.02 536.26 A: did you used to 

535.84 541.80 B: yeah but i worked in like health care which is about as far away from a court as you can get 

541.54 543.30 A: yeah 

542.37 543.25 B: so 

544.24 545.23 B: um 

547.42 549.72 B: okay how long has it been 

550.86 560.01 A: um i think it's been about eight now but i'm not sure um i wonder if they'll cut us off i haven't done this one before so 

554.06 555.16 B: (( yay i )) 

559.19 560.53 B: haven't either 

561.59 562.88 B: um 

562.57 563.52 A: mm 

563.04 564.71 B: let's see what else 

565.82 567.20 A: perjury 

569.37 571.09 B: (( i am )) 

571.70 575.60 B: flipping through the internet so we can talk about perjury 

575.66 576.49 A: okay 

579.10 580.01 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

585.46 590.70 A: it's so hard it would be almost impossible to answer unless you were in the situation i think 

590.09 591.12 B: (( [noise] right )) 

594.33 597.91 A: and of course you'd want to think that you were honest but you'd also want to think that you 

598.25 599.90 A: well you know the sort of person
