108.86 110.38 A: seven or eight surrounding towns

112.98 114.93 B: um not if it were just your store would you 

115.19 117.01 B: keep it the same or would you kind of change the 

116.70 119.80 A: oh i would change some certain i would definitely make some changes for sure

129.14 131.88 A: his life used to have a thing can run for such a long time 

132.36 136.08 A: one thing i would do is definitely put in a computer system he doesn't have a computer everything is paper 

136.47 137.15 B: mhm 

138.04 141.45 B: uh that is pretty simple to well not simple to him but 

141.66 145.09 A: yeah he is he is more is just more afraid of it than anything else 

145.48 146.34 A: and the cost of 

146.48 150.14 A: just starting something up and and so forth but eventually he is going to have to do it 

150.35 152.53 B: yes it is not even that much now though 

150.63 150.99 A: mhm 

152.36 153.17 A: no it is not 

152.85 155.36 B: but if he had like a small business accounting software 

154.97 156.22 A: oh absolutely 

156.11 157.42 B: yeah not a big deal at all 

156.79 158.82 A: uh i even i even offered to h- to have

164.63 165.84 A: we'll see one thing at a time 

166.68 171.54 B: well a little a little harder for me i don't do that i i'm a researcher for a big company so

210.33 210.79 A: okay 

210.38 211.38 B: i love doing that stuff 

211.90 213.12 B: so i can totally see doing that 

213.94 214.44 B: um 

215.34 217.51 B: but most people do that seems like it is just sort of 

218.16 220.66 B: you know one person a one person operation 

221.29 221.86 A: yeah 

222.16 225.61 A: yeah until you until they tell you how many people you end of getting you know you get 

225.83 226.21 A: you know would 

225.90 226.33 B: yeah 

226.64 227.64 B: yeah i guess eventually 

226.78 229.01 A: and you need you need to have a lot of (( ins )) with 

230.01 233.83 A: with whether it's travel a- you know if you are doing travel it is travel agents or 

234.60 238.60 A: uh if you are dealing with stores like you know some of the big department stores you need to get in 

238.99 240.20 A: good with i guess uh 

241.20 243.61 A: the management there or the sales people there or 

243.85 244.20 B: yup 

244.33 244.75 B: yup 

244.98 248.20 B: doing a lot of research on the the stores that sounds pretty good to me

249.51 250.25 B: know what is there 

250.94 253.95 B: um i i'll probably going to do that the other thing i really like is 

254.04 256.21 B: i i love animals we have three cats 

256.32 259.03 B: and i can definitely see myself being like a pet-sitter 

256.36 256.72 A: mhm 

259.63 261.62 B: and i know how much we pay our pet-sitter 

262.03 263.85 B: it is just as much some people pay for uh 

262.93 267.14 A: i have a friend who does that too and she does she does like the house slash pet- sitting 

264.21 265.38 B: house care 

267.93 270.05 B: oh really see that is both like common 

269.16 275.01 A: yeah she will watch the house you know she will stay at the house and and and take care of the pets and she does quite well with that actually 

271.80 272.22 B: yeah 

274.93 280.00 B: yeah yeah our pet-sitter you know like she will take in our mail and stuff so she does sort of look after the house too 

280.20 284.57 A: yeah i mean you could you she could she literally almost didn't never never had lived at home for like six months 

280.63 281.24 B: but uh 

284.98 285.38 B: wow 

285.60 286.41 A: -cause she was so busy 

287.11 289.26 B: yeah and that is the kind of thing where you could sort of 

289.67 293.19 B: take on or as much or little work as you want and really set your own hours and 

291.54 292.22 A: absolutely 

293.74 294.14 B: um

301.31 302.80 B: i i have no problem doing that 

302.88 306.65 A: i uh he says it all comes down to reputation when it comes to that you know it's word of mouth and 

303.52 304.05 B: (( that makes sense ))

440.17 440.51 B: uh 

443.82 444.81 A: when he is working but 

445.68 447.97 B: uh i guess if he is at his desk and he can do other s- 

447.34 450.90 A: yeah like he does that is all he does just sit in front of a desk and does programming so 

448.07 448.65 B: (( ))

451.54 451.80 B: (( )) 

452.61 452.88 B: yup 

453.03 454.42 B: after school (( )) 

453.41 455.14 A: this this one sounded really interesting though 

455.31 455.80 B: yeah 

455.89 456.14 A: um 

455.96 456.28 B: yeah 

457.29 459.40 B: but wow what else can we talk about 

459.58 460.95 B: we have exhausted our topic 

461.48 462.30 A: um 

463.45 465.81 B: what if you couldn't do jewelry what if you got to do something else 

464.35 469.79 A: well the only ot- the only other thing that i thought well the only thing i think i was i almost did was actually uh open up a bar 

470.45 471.25 B: oh 

471.15 472.12 A: a bar restaurant 

471.35 474.71 B: boy that is that is a tricky one right i mean restaurants are 

472.28 473.80 A: with u- with 

474.49 483.06 A: yeah it is it is tough we i had a friend of mine who we were we were really seriously talking about it and some place warm like florida most likely or 

476.51 476.78 B: uh 

483.05 483.53 B: mhm 

483.63 487.55 A: that has good weather just about all year round and but we would be on the water 

488.35 489.11 B: oh sounds good 

488.53 490.53 A: some place where boats could pull up to 

490.91 491.44 A: you know 

492.02 493.88 A: when the season was right or just anytime 

494.19 494.60 B: yeah 

494.69 495.59 A: and uh 

496.13 499.68 A: you know basically just a bar and entertainment and just a light menu not nothing 

499.81 500.49 A: nothing big 

500.79 501.25 B: mhm 

500.99 504.11 A: but i know it is a it is a difficult a very difficult business to 

503.88 506.17 B: yeah the restaurant business is a killer right 

505.88 511.88 A: yeah i mean i think i don't know the the the failure rate is probably like eight percent or something like that in the first year or two so 

510.28 511.13 B: (( )) that yeah 

511.84 512.11 B: yup 

512.71 513.01 B: yup 

513.61 515.90 B: yeah i guess yeah my other choice would be uh 

516.49 516.82 B: i mean 

517.22 520.20 B: speaking of like moving somewhere where you would like to live is uh 

520.49 523.85 B: go somewhere nice and uh open a bed and breakfast 

523.81 524.30 A: yeah 

524.54 526.10 B: yeah th- that would be really fun 

525.24 529.45 A: me and my me and my wife do a lot of uh traveling and we stay in a lot of b._n._b. s that is nice 

529.27 535.30 B: yeah that just always seemed really nice i mean it is obviously it is a lot of work and you are always having people kind of 

535.57 537.57 B: coming to your house and you don't really have 

537.89 538.88 B: your house to yourself 

538.90 540.11 A: absolute it is it is tough 

539.56 540.13 B: (( )) 

540.54 540.93 A: yeah 

541.37 544.69 B: but uh you know you can live somewhere nice that people want to come to and 

545.43 546.49 B: have uh (( )) 

545.56 547.45 A: you really have to enjoy that though i mean that 

547.43 547.89 B: yeah 

548.64 550.03 A: that is hard the hospitality 

550.50 551.74 A: world is very difficult 

552.02 552.50 B: yeah 

552.62 553.07 B: yeah 

553.66 554.44 B: (( but i think it is fun )) 

553.76 557.86 A: especially if you do your own especially if you do your own you know your own housekeeping too 

558.54 559.17 B: yeah 

559.10 560.37 A: you know that would be the tough part 

559.43 559.96 B: yeah 

560.78 563.51 B: yeah it depends on you know i don't have enough vision of like some 

563.66 567.21 B: huge victorian rambling house you know with all sorts of
