21.69 25.95 B: okay well let's see what was the question would we panic or remain calm during a 

23.79 24.04 A: (( )) 

25.49 26.64 A: yeah would 

26.04 27.07 B: terrorist attack 

27.08 27.73 A: right 

27.65 28.27 B: um 

28.66 33.06 B: i have to say that although i'd like to remain calm i probably would panic 
33.82 37.18 A: i feel the same way i think everyone in the country probably would 

37.84 39.26 A: agree to that don't you 

39.36 41.72 B: yeah i think even even uh 

39.39 39.75 A: uh 

42.14 44.13 B: given the oh 

44.86 47.63 B: well the fact that we have had a 

47.95 49.99 B: an attack several attacks actually 

50.38 53.05 B: um i don't think anything prepares you for that and i 

53.23 54.44 B: i don't think uh 

54.93 58.54 B: yeah any mental preparation we might think we would have i think 

58.78 59.62 B: at least for me 

59.86 61.64 B: would probably go out the window 

61.88 63.28 A: yes i agree with you 

63.47 63.89 B: yeah 

64.08 64.56 A: yeah 

64.68 66.88 B: and hopefully we won't have to find out right 

67.03 67.99 A: right 

68.11 70.45 A: where are you located in the country are you 

70.14 70.55 B: uh 

70.64 72.60 A: near the kind of situation or 

70.66 71.30 B: i'm in 

72.10 81.27 B: no a- well not uh for the uh you know the september eleven things uh go but i'm in i'm in san diego which is a huge navy town 

81.38 82.53 A: oh mhm 

82.02 84.85 B: and so there is a lot of talk about uh 

85.09 86.00 B: uh you know 

86.52 90.62 B: hm possible attacks on you know in the harbor and 

89.81 90.64 A: in the harbor 

90.78 91.42 A: mhm 

91.09 95.35 B: with uh we are kind of close to santa (( )) nuclear plants so 

95.72 99.37 B: that was another big concern um you know in the recent past but 

99.48 100.09 A: i see 

100.10 102.18 B: uh you know how about you 

101.80 110.26 A: i'm in florida and i'm not in any kind of situation like that but i do travel down to miami occasionally and 

109.93 110.45 B: mhm 

110.35 113.86 A: you know it's it's a big city and i think of it sometimes 

113.97 116.10 A: but uh you can't really 

116.24 117.79 A: be scared all the time either 

117.91 120.71 B: no it well be- it doesn't help 

120.93 121.35 A: no 

121.43 127.76 B: you know it is not going to prepare you for you know if something happens and and even if it did i 

128.24 132.94 B: you know i it's not going to i don't think to be any preventative measure so 

133.76 138.81 B: but it is hard not to uh wonder sometimes especially when you keep getting these 

139.58 142.95 B: these uh alerts from the government you know 

143.08 143.60 A: yes 

143.45 148.54 B: (( the )) yellow alert it is like what are we supposed to do they never tell us that 

147.25 148.16 A: i'm on a 

148.84 157.98 A: the uh network uh or not the network but the internet um has this website that i signed up for that gives you all the terrorism news in the country 

157.82 158.58 B: oh really 

158.53 159.34 A: yeah 

159.58 160.13 A: and it is 

160.82 162.98 A: it's quite a lot going on all the time 

163.27 163.71 A: um 

163.43 164.26 B: is that right 

164.38 164.97 A: yeah 

165.15 165.48 B: and it is 

165.67 166.59 B: from the government 

166.94 172.33 A: uh it is a terror it is like a news flash everyday they give you the headlines 

172.89 173.86 B: oh my gosh 

173.69 174.50 A: yeah 

174.89 178.71 B: i don't supposed you know that uh web address off the top of your head do you 

178.30 182.22 A: no and and i i only have web t._v. so i can't 

182.44 184.63 A: talk and give it to you at the same time 

184.21 184.76 B: yeah 

184.89 185.54 A: so 

185.15 186.78 B: well i'll check on uh 

187.35 189.80 B: google or something and see if i can find out 

188.44 189.18 A: y- yeah 

190.60 192.65 B: i'm sure there is uh that is interesting though 

193.22 195.14 B: but i guess it would does it make you more 

195.58 196.49 B: does it make you feel 

196.71 198.69 B: safer that you know or 

198.90 200.61 A: not particularly 

199.06 200.70 B: more scared that it is going on 

200.75 209.66 A: not particularly i i happen to have a friend that works in um los angeles harbor right near san pedro and she speaks of uh 

207.94 208.40 B: uh-huh 

210.12 213.20 A: the terrorism uh they kind of expected 

213.81 217.39 A: in that kind of an area more now than on the planes 

215.45 215.93 B: yeah 

217.16 217.66 B: yeah 

217.74 220.16 A: so it is something to be on guard for 

220.58 221.41 B: yeah it 

221.97 222.85 B: something uh 

223.23 224.67 B: unfortunately i think it's 

225.00 228.13 B: probably not ever going to end now and 

228.39 228.76 A: no 

228.81 232.28 B: you know it in our world and in our part of the country 

232.41 233.36 B: uh we are in 

233.69 234.85 B: part of the planet i 

234.96 236.30 B: suppose it has been going on 

236.99 239.53 B: for years and years all over the place but 

239.74 240.73 B: you know until it 

241.32 242.90 B: i guess until it really hit us 

243.58 246.21 B: i don't think most americans were truly aware 

246.32 251.05 A: i don't think they realized how ha- hard it is until it happened here 

250.56 251.01 B: yeah 

251.18 251.65 A: yeah 

251.40 254.33 B: yeah it what was amazing to me was uh 

254.53 255.30 B: right after the 

255.55 256.48 B: the attacks 

256.58 257.16 B: the uh 

257.75 260.25 B: the entire world mourned and 

260.76 261.31 B: you know 

261.42 263.58 B: paid tribute and cried and 

264.00 268.23 B: i don't see that we do that a lot when it happens elsewhere you know 

267.66 269.46 A: you are right 

268.91 271.64 B: and i i think we maybe we were 

269.77 270.63 A: yeah 

272.24 274.61 B: complaisant or comfortable or just 

274.83 275.59 A: uh sure 

275.66 276.97 B: ignorant maybe that's 

277.24 279.57 B: that's kind of scary too that we are not uh 

280.06 280.51 B: yeah 

281.02 283.19 A: we've never had a war 

281.07 282.07 B: we are not aware 

282.66 284.04 B: mhm exactly 

284.91 286.55 B: yeah so 

286.95 290.17 B: when you did you just sign up for this uh um

301.39 306.94 B: oh (( didn't you )) yeah i got one the other day but i guess they couldn't find another person and they 

306.98 307.49 A: uh-huh 

307.34 310.56 B: kept coming back saying you know are you willing to wait and i 

310.87 316.97 B: i waited for awhile but then i had to work you know and i thought you know i'm not going to sit here for ten minutes while they are calling everybody 

317.24 320.68 A: did they give you the details of the lengths of the calls or n- 

317.50 317.88 B: so

330.63 331.40 B: is it you know 

332.29 336.58 B: just some magic word we are supposed to say i don't know 

335.09 337.87 A: you can only talk about something so long 

337.95 342.14 B: yeah it is uh it is um you know actually i'm looking right now if uh 

342.56 345.12 B: on my my e. mail that said uh 

345.82 349.24 B: uh let's see it gives an intro about the 

350.11 351.56 B: topic but it says 

352.58 355.34 B: uh doesn't say doesn't say anything 

354.79 355.28 A: no 

355.72 358.04 A: i found it on the deals connection this one 

358.16 358.90 A: one girl got 

359.69 363.37 A: two hundred and twenty five dollars she had so many calls she was given in a month 

363.56 364.59 B: wow 

363.66 363.91 A: so 

364.07 365.78 A: that is not bad huh 

365.46 366.57 B: that is not bad at all 

367.12 370.88 B: yeah i had uh i participated in something like this w- 

371.23 376.00 B: it was basically a uh voice recognition system a few years ago and um 

376.70 377.25 B: uh 

377.42 379.26 B: they sent you a 

379.67 381.78 B: list of words and then you would just 

382.00 383.52 B: say the words into the phone and 

383.95 388.31 B: and i did that for a couple of years actually and it was uh you can whenever wanted and 

388.65 389.99 B: you know and they uh 

390.37 393.74 B: they paid with uh gift certificates to places that i thought 

394.10 398.99 B: well you know if i don't have to go you know you know and pay ten dollars in gas at arco or whatever 

398.99 399.82 A: oh yeah 

399.40 403.35 B: you know it is ten bucks i saved so it was kind of like earning money you know 

402.85 404.51 A: sure that works 

403.87 404.99 B: yeah it was fine 

405.46 406.23 B: but uh 

405.58 405.83 A: huh 

406.48 411.48 B: yeah this one i'm i'm looking here and i i'm reading this whole thing and i don't see anything about 

412.35 413.55 B: anything 

413.65 414.93 B: i don't know how long 

416.49 417.54 B: you know i don't know

418.57 419.59 A: i really don't 

418.61 424.34 B: can you imagine the person listening to these recordings though going what are they talking about 

423.95 433.27 A: well the only thing you can say about terrorism is that is going to continue and it is not they are not going to give up especially with this war coming 

424.72 426.22 B: how long are we supposed to talk 

431.23 431.62 B: yeah 

432.78 435.03 B: oh absolutely and i think that is the 

435.39 439.45 B: the thing that uh well a few people have pointed this out that 

439.87 443.04 B: even if you know let's say we uh somehow 

443.49 447.15 B: i don't know found out every terrorist in the world and you know 

447.93 449.91 B: put them in some prison or something 

450.32 452.67 B: um you've got people growing up 

453.04 456.78 B: who you know right now they are eight nine ten whatever 

457.13 457.74 B: growing up 

458.15 460.24 B: thinking that this is you know 

460.69 462.27 B: this is the way to go and 

462.47 463.27 A: oh yeah 

462.67 465.14 B: wanting uh you know retribution and 

465.43 467.72 B: and that sort of thing and i think it is just 

468.11 470.17 B: you know it is basically here to stay 

470.56 472.54 B: i hate to say that -cause i know that the 

473.55 474.68 B: uh i know that 

474.81 478.29 B: right now the phrase the war on terror is a uh 

478.75 479.88 B: you know kind of a 

479.30 480.46 A: popular yeah 

480.34 480.78 B: yeah 

480.95 482.50 B: kind of a battle cry for 

483.13 484.84 B: people and uh i i just 

484.99 486.73 B: i don't think it is going away at all 

487.00 487.48 A: no 

487.60 488.09 A: no 

487.93 488.29 B: so 

496.86 498.65 A: things have really changed 

496.87 497.30 B: no 

498.89 499.36 B: yeah 

499.04 503.08 A: in the world you know it is tough it is tough on kids you know
