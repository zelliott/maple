150.25 152.61 A: what's an example of not acceptable humor

161.02 162.62 A: oh my god 

162.02 166.62 B: but i don't even think that's not acceptable i mean you have to experience it

184.55 185.74 B: oh 

186.37 188.37 B: yeah

198.84 200.86 A: lenny bruce what kind of humor did he do 

200.46 201.67 B: well he was 

201.92 212.60 B: um a very cynical man he lived in hollywood and he became um a heroin addict and i don't know if he died of an overdose of heroin but he was like 

212.79 215.07 B: stretching the boundaries 

215.91 219.94 B: kind of like what janice joplin did with with rock music 

220.25 220.96 A: (( hm hm )) 

220.29 224.14 B: he was doing that with humor he was one of the first bitter comics 

224.11 226.40 A: lenny bruce have you ah 

226.63 227.57 A: huh 

227.72 232.09 B: yeah he's pretty famous if you're ever going to do any research on comedy 

232.17 236.10 B: he's one of the early wise guys i guess he would be 

236.42 237.87 B: you know sid caesar 

238.53 239.61 A: would be who 

239.41 241.82 B: si- have you heard of sid caesar 

241.52 242.36 A: no 

242.40 245.28 B: (( [laughter] where did you grow up ))

257.84 262.07 B: yeah well sid caesar did a lot of live t._v. in the fifties 

261.72 262.97 A: (( sid caesar )) 

263.04 265.76 B: yeah c. a. e. s. a. r. 

265.48 266.28 A: uh-huh 

266.03 267.18 B: and um 

267.40 273.60 B: he still does some things but he's an old man now but he you know he was so fresh and funny 

273.91 275.22 A: no go on go on 

275.04 278.99 B: and op- actually the opposite of lenny bruce lenny bruce was 

279.29 282.47 B: dark and angry and bitter and cynical 

281.84 286.64 A: i've got a really good example of unacceptable humor how about the osbornes 

284.33 285.29 B: uh-huh 

286.83 292.29 B: i you know i haven't watched that i don't i i i'm not into i don't know what's going on there 

291.59 297.40 A: well i don't know what's going on there either because it's just not funny as far as i'm concerned but here's this family 

297.53 300.78 A: with um you know ossie osborne is the dad 

300.83 310.87 A: and ah you know swearing up a storm and on one level it's kind of cool because he's you know he's honest he's up front he's forthright i mean there are no- there's nothing hidden 

311.35 313.53 A: but at the same time 

316.01 321.75 A: there's i mean it it's kind of not funny it's funny because it's shocking i mean people watch it because 

320.16 321.21 B: mhm 

321.77 323.03 A: it's 

323.05 325.74 A: it's different from the norm right 

324.85 326.54 B: it's off putting huh 

326.14 327.10 A: new 

327.49 329.82 B: puts you off instead of takes you in 

329.58 334.55 A: well it puts me off i find it unacceptable why do i find it unacceptable because 

330.96 331.89 B: uh-huh 

335.22 341.43 A: here's an old guy ossie osborne who's gone through hell and back i mean there's something 

341.70 349.12 A: i i don't know is there is it worth i mean that whole thing of losing of of having innocence for a period of time and then losing it 

349.41 356.58 A: and sort of slowly developing a sense of maturity a sense of how things really are is that really worth anything i mean is that 

356.74 359.82 A: period of magic innocence really worth anything 

360.01 366.92 A: and you know if if ossie osborne has been through hell and back is that up front with everybody 

368.82 372.40 B: you mean does it make any distinctions in his relationships 

368.88 369.86 A: (( i mean )) 

372.17 381.26 A: well yeah i mean is he is he you know are his kids do they still have that or you know do they sort of lose it does it become 

372.89 373.85 B: yeah 

381.90 392.60 B: i would guess from what i've read i would guess you're right they have lost it and they never had it actually but i've actually never heard these people talk i've only read about them in the newspaper 

393.81 401.68 B: so um [cough] i think acceptable is what draws you in and unacceptable is what puts you off 

402.04 405.40 B: so in that case you could apply it to just about anything 

405.65 409.12 A: yeah i agree and so for different people it's different things 

406.33 407.24 B: yeah 

408.73 409.81 B: uh-huh 

409.42 411.85 A: entirely what the hell's the topic again 

411.63 418.37 B: [laughter] comedy [laughter] the line between acceptable and unacceptable 

412.60 414.01 A: [laughter] 

415.15 416.23 A: [laughter] 

417.62 420.31 A: i'll tell you what's unacceptable jerry springer 

420.58 422.97 B: okay but that's not comedy 

422.75 424.76 A: (( oh i don't know i mean )) 

424.37 426.92 B: you think that's comedy i don't think that that is comedy 

426.06 433.44 A: i don't know when i watched that i sit there you know half turned off half roaring in laughter going oh my god this is incredible 

433.30 433.94 B: (( mm )) 

433.51 439.08 A: and you know slightly disgusted at myself for actually leaving the t._v. on for those thirty more seconds mm 

438.38 443.10 B: yeah but that's another distinction isn't it laughing at and laughing with 

444.13 450.54 B: so if you laugh i mean i just remember this one guy that was on jerry springer i couldn't believe it he was ah 

451.59 457.15 B: [cough] a neo nazi person who was old and dying of cancer right there on the show 

456.82 457.66 A: uh-huh 

457.38 464.70 B: oh it was horrible and i didn't feel engaged at all in that and you know 

464.88 471.42 B: that was just people who laughed at that in the audience they were laughing at this poor guy 

471.20 472.07 A: right 

471.98 475.49 B: and i think that's unacceptable 

475.36 476.84 A: you know i'd agree there 

476.50 478.46 B: yeah 

478.90 480.62 B: but i think that you know the 

480.72 484.02 B: best kind of humor is the kind that really gives you a 

484.57 485.66 B: an insight 

485.78 488.31 B: and it can do that because it pulls you in 

489.87 492.50 A: [sigh] what do you do for a living 

492.30 496.53 B: i'm a teacher i teach college english as a second language
