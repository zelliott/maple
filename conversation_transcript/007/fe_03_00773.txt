199.19 200.97 A: plus you have a job to rely on 

203.14 205.44 B: but you would be all alone there in a foreign country 

206.62 207.01 A: no 

207.32 209.21 A: -cause like i said i would have my kids with me 

209.73 210.90 A: so i wouldn't be alone

400.74 401.83 B: you can start your own business 

402.32 405.62 A: yeah but a mil- a million dollars is a nice nesting to start out with
