34.67 37.12 B: okay what would you consider do you have children 

37.87 42.16 A: what i consider appropriate for them is different from what i consider appropriate for me

68.76 70.80 B: appropriate in a comedy 

70.39 71.55 A: right 

71.42 75.39 B: i i think the some of the vulgarity some of the 

75.28 76.26 A: right 

76.30 78.45 B: goes a little bit too far 

78.53 82.66 B: um even say watching comedy club on t._v. 

82.31 85.47 A: oh yeah definitely [laughter] that shouldn't be for kids 

85.01 91.34 B: i think well i don't even like it for me and i'm not a prude but i i just don't think that 

92.65 99.56 B: the use of the f. word you know without coming right and saying it every other word is 

95.30 96.26 A: mhm 

99.63 102.75 B: necessary to get a funny idea across 

102.70 110.66 A: yeah that and i don't like it when um my husband likes to watch death jam comedy on the b._e._p. network 

110.08 110.99 B: uh-huh 

110.73 115.06 A: and i don't like it even when the black people are using the 'n' word 

114.50 115.92 B: oh no 

115.21 117.55 A: referring to themselves and the 

117.60 122.61 A: that just it's i don't see where the swearing or that kind of stuff is really necessary 

122.28 128.51 B: well that's it i mean you know what does the what's the point does it make something 

128.56 129.54 B: funnier 

129.67 135.09 B: no i don't think it does you know i don't think it it adds to humor at all 

135.40 136.32 B: (( um )) 

137.23 138.06 B: you know 

138.08 140.40 B: how long are we supposed to talk about this 

139.78 143.73 A: i guess there's supposed to be a recording that comes in and tells us when we're over [laughter] 

142.48 149.47 B: [laughter] okay they had called me once before but they couldn't find anybody to 

149.49 151.40 B: participate so 

150.42 151.88 A: yeah same thing here 

151.81 152.90 B: um 

152.31 156.61 A: yeah the other thing that we recently watched was shrek 

156.23 157.28 B: okay 

156.87 162.70 A: and everybody told me it was great it was hilarious and all that but my granddaughter is six 

162.33 163.21 B: uh-huh 

162.75 166.27 A: and throughout the entire movie um there's 

166.51 168.40 A: a donkey in the movie 

168.75 174.61 A: uh there's an ogre and a donkey that are the two main characters throughout the entire movie they referred to the donkey as an ass 

170.36 171.39 B: right 

175.00 176.42 B: (( mhm )) 

175.79 177.19 A: (( and )) 

176.57 180.10 B: now i've seen shrek a couple of times and i've never noticed that i guess 

180.25 182.02 B: maybe i need to 

182.71 183.67 A: well 

182.82 192.31 B: pay some more attention well my grandson is almost he'll be three next month and it's like he goes in phases he wants one movie 

193.05 195.11 B: a hundred times in a row 

194.34 195.91 A: right uh-huh 

195.33 197.86 B: and shrek was a couple of months ago 

198.38 201.02 B: that was his his movie of the month 

201.32 202.76 B: and uh 

203.44 205.81 B: so i watched it first to see 

206.07 208.74 B: and i must of totally missed that 

208.26 217.66 A: well it's it's one of those things where yeah one word for a donkey appropriately is an ass but they use it and my granddaughter is in the potty humor stage 

217.07 218.61 B: okay yeah 

217.98 228.03 A: so maybe that's why it became more appropriate to her you know there's thing like um right after he saves the princess he says he's got to go save his ass yeah 

227.98 230.26 B: okay yeah you know what 

228.77 229.77 A: and 

230.29 232.98 B: now that you point it out i remember that 

232.38 240.05 A: and my granddaughter just started she just though it was the most hilarious thing in the world because they said they said a dirty word [laughter] 

235.44 237.44 B: oh yes i'm sure 

238.85 241.47 B: and she was rolling on the floor laughing 

240.73 252.96 A: oh she thought it was and then after that whenever we'd go by we live out in the country so we'd go by a field with horses or cows in there she'd say i wonder if there's any asses in there and then start laughing hysterically and 

249.50 251.07 B: oh yeah 

252.46 255.14 B: i guess like i said i have a 

255.43 256.95 B: fifteen year old son 

257.32 259.09 B: i also have 

259.31 262.05 B: three children in their twenties and thirties 

262.84 264.30 B: (( and uh )) 

265.67 267.35 B: (( even them )) 

267.74 269.83 B: i have to really you know 

270.25 272.52 B: really crack on them a lot 

272.55 273.96 B: around my son 

274.52 282.48 B: and while he finds it the swearing the profanity he seems to find it it's just no big deal to him 

282.30 283.46 A: mhm 

282.87 284.21 B: it is to me 

284.61 286.24 B: (( and if i )) 

286.36 287.65 B: what's 

288.09 289.39 B: the point 

289.93 294.18 B: you know i tell my daughter constantly when she's talking you know she'll 

294.55 296.94 B: be telling a joke or something and as 

297.65 303.48 B: well they often thing did this f-ing thing i'm like tricia oops shouldn't 

303.94 304.81 A: uh-huh 

304.40 306.85 B: you know you're not making it any funnier 

307.44 308.52 B: you know 

308.78 311.24 B: your use of the words 

312.01 316.82 B: are detracting from the humor if anything else and that's how i feel about 

316.93 318.49 B: the comedy on t._v. 

319.03 320.23 B: and 

321.31 324.41 B: are you a fan of brittany spears 

323.96 324.81 A: no 

324.96 325.90 B: okay 

325.40 328.86 A: i think that children should be allowed to be children 

329.03 331.99 A: and i think brittany spears and um 

332.07 335.08 A: the other one christine aguilera that are both so young 

334.88 335.73 B: uh-huh 

335.15 339.90 A: they were the mousketeers are encouraging these little girls to 

339.73 341.31 B: grow up 

340.47 344.05 A: to grow up and try to be sexual way too fast 

343.72 346.53 B: now i'm not familiar with brittany spears 

346.89 352.08 B: but i had rented a movie the other night and i wasn't even aware she was in it 

351.34 353.40 A: oh yeah i haven't seen that one yet 

352.87 354.29 B: and uh 

355.45 356.91 B: it's an older one 

357.19 358.84 B: crossroads 

358.21 360.11 A: yes it's her only movie 

359.63 362.02 B: the movie was fantastic 

363.49 364.55 B: (( but )) 

364.56 366.12 B: it showed her nude 

366.16 367.15 A: oh 

367.58 368.66 B: why 

369.68 371.53 B: you know it didn't 

371.84 375.81 B: it didn't add anything to the movie in my opinion at all 

376.43 379.84 B: the story line the plot was a really good 

380.01 381.18 B: plot 

381.23 384.21 B: but why why the nudity you know 

384.85 391.31 B: it just didn't it made no sense to me whatsoever and of course my fifteen year old hey you know

403.93 404.97 B: right

409.51 410.48 B: yes 

413.24 414.10 B: uh-huh 

413.79 416.60 A: and i think he must be rolling over in his grave 

416.15 417.87 B: oh without a doubt 

417.44 420.28 A: because christine aguilera is an old um 

420.46 425.09 A: is one of the mousketeers from the new mickey mouse club um 

424.63 426.72 B: see i'm not familiar with her either
