167.62 168.99 A: that would be nice 

168.74 170.17 B: mhm 

170.22 172.00 A: well let's see 

172.01 178.40 A: if i were to start an ice skating rink as i said i would have to find a decent facility now 

178.49 183.22 A: i notice that up in birmingham alabama they they have 

183.40 185.57 A: what appears to be 

186.13 190.47 A: ah it's almost like a motel except they've 

190.96 191.92 B: mhm 

191.19 195.92 A: torn the walls out and just made it into this huge area 

195.70 196.56 B: mhm 

196.49 198.35 A: and um 

198.85 200.17 A: that could be done 

200.27 201.21 B: oh 

200.57 212.60 A: but i would put it in destin florida and then i would have to find people who would want to to ice skate i think there would be a lot of people in the summer for example who would like to do that 

212.35 213.50 B: (( mhm )) 

212.92 220.76 A: because it gets very hot down here and then there would probably be people in the winter who come down from the north 

215.17 216.18 B: (( mhm )) 

220.41 221.46 B: mhm 

220.94 223.93 A: and who enjoy their um 

224.39 230.69 A: who enjoy those kinds of sports but don't enjoy doing them out in the cold anymore 

230.24 231.22 B: mhm 

231.29 233.35 A: so they could do that 

232.79 233.70 B: (( ah )) 

233.41 234.74 A: down here 

235.22 236.97 B: (( people would like that )) 

236.73 240.72 A: yeah i'm not so sure that i would be the best 

241.27 246.69 A: the best manager but i have a friend that i know that would be an excellent manager 

246.23 248.21 B: mhm you can hire that 

247.91 249.69 A: yeah you can hire that 

249.44 250.97 B: yeah 

250.88 256.14 A: so what kind of foods would you would you sell in your restaurant huh 

256.15 260.57 B: ah i want to sell indian spicy food 

260.08 261.35 A: mhm 

260.63 264.31 B: (( like ah lots of people yeah biryani )) 

261.68 262.91 A: (( biryani ))

269.10 271.85 B: (( and er i like cooking )) 

272.02 274.68 B: so that would be a great for me 

274.30 275.11 A: mhm 

275.24 276.94 B: but ah 

277.31 281.41 B: for that i need a lot of money you know 

280.37 281.31 A: yeah 

281.56 287.06 B: that's the main issue i do not have that much money 

287.24 289.41 A: d- um how 

287.79 288.43 B: (( so )) 

289.50 290.97 A: let's see 

291.89 296.15 A: i love you w- so you would do mostly northern indian foods do 

295.36 299.28 B: yeah northern indian food but i north india 

296.86 298.78 A: you live in do you live 

298.93 303.73 A: in and do you live in i know delhi's north india do you live in the north at this point 

303.83 306.49 B: (( ah no in california yeah )) 

304.64 305.84 A: in the united 

305.90 307.71 A: you're in california 

308.73 314.78 A: 'cause i also love good dhosas and and southern indian foods too 

311.96 312.98 B: oh 

314.70 315.66 B: (( ah huh )) 

316.27 320.85 B: (( ah huh i think in california there are lots of indian restaurants )) 

320.56 321.76 A: are there 

320.95 323.21 B: or chains out there yeah 

324.07 324.82 B: (( people )) 

325.11 328.06 B: (( ah people have a lot of choices too )) 

328.67 329.77 A: mhm 

330.15 334.21 B: so that i want to start a business [laughter] 

333.92 339.33 A: well now would you b- would your would your food be predominantly vegetarian 

339.40 342.87 B: (( ah vegetarian or non vegetarian both )) 

342.90 343.95 A: both 

343.83 345.40 B: yeah 

345.08 348.87 A: well that's that would be a good good range 

348.60 349.79 B: mhm 

350.38 351.22 A: well i- 

351.45 353.65 A: i think that would be very interesting 

353.30 354.71 B: [laughter] 

354.24 360.50 A: i think it's since the closest that i can find indian food is in in atlanta georgia 

359.80 360.98 B: oh 

360.80 364.61 A: which means i have to drive five hours to get to it 

363.42 364.30 B: (( uh-huh )) 

364.68 368.10 B: (( uh-huh actually i think in florida there )) 

368.12 370.50 B: are not much indians 

369.90 371.74 A: mhm 

371.13 372.44 B: that's why ah 

372.53 375.71 B: (( in california there are lots of indians )) 

377.54 379.73 A: well that makes a major difference 

379.14 380.50 B: yeah 

379.91 382.08 A: you know when you have the population 

382.05 383.03 B: (( uh-huh )) 

382.67 389.58 A: not as much the population to support it because you would expect to you know to sell to other people 

386.99 388.22 B: (( yeah )) 

389.35 390.71 B: (( yeah )) 

390.09 391.55 A: but um 

392.68 401.23 A: people just when you've got a larger population people get used to thinking about the fact that that that food of that ethnicity would be there 

400.91 402.28 B: mhm 

405.51 406.63 B: so 

407.49 408.44 B: (( ah )) 

409.12 412.79 B: how about your your business like hm 

413.04 417.46 B: you want to start a medium business or large business 

417.30 419.68 A: well of course an ice rink would be 

420.74 426.24 A: [laughter] i don't know i always thought it'd take a couple of cou- you know i was thinking this morning 

426.29 431.57 A: hm i'm wondering if i could do this for two hundred and fifty thousand somehow i don't think so 

431.34 432.20 B: (( ah huh )) 

431.96 435.69 A: i'm betting it's going to be closer to a million or more 

435.26 436.30 B: uh-huh 

435.94 436.98 A: you know 

436.91 438.14 B: yeah 

437.54 438.87 A: um 

439.25 441.28 A: and and then 

441.68 444.53 A: th- you know the question then becomes 

444.87 448.45 A: what kind of income do you have to make off of it 

448.24 449.28 B: mhm 

449.00 456.18 A: in order to make it a viable business where you're not just pouring money into something that you love 

451.33 452.43 B: yeah 

455.75 456.95 B: yeah 

456.20 458.57 A: and not expecting a return 

458.33 461.40 B: you don't you should have always thought of that 

461.25 462.34 A: yeah 

462.59 463.89 A: and i don't 

464.15 464.92 A: m- 

465.04 472.85 A: my the friend that i was talking about who could manage it originally wanted to set up an ice rink in newport news virginia 

472.71 473.36 B: (( mhm oh )) 

473.22 477.01 A: and so he's done a lot of research on it 

476.78 477.66 B: (( mhm )) 

477.25 479.67 A: that's why i'd bring him down [laughter] 

480.93 482.49 B: [laughter] 

482.27 485.49 A: but i have a feeling that we're beginning to talk 

485.93 489.38 A: in the seven figures [laughter] you know 

488.59 489.39 B: (( ah )) 

489.42 490.15 B: yeah 

490.28 496.63 A: so that that would be a much more heavy investment than than i'm at this point 

492.80 493.73 B: mhm 

496.55 497.51 B: (( ah huh )) 

497.18 502.29 A: in my life capable of doing but but if i won the lottery 

502.00 503.17 B: [laughter] 

503.48 504.58 B: (( yeah ah )) 

504.29 507.17 A: it might be something that would be worthwhile considering 

507.09 507.85 B: (( huh )) 

507.95 513.68 A: the other thing i've thought about doing as a part time business would be astrology charts 

513.35 514.34 B: oh 

515.09 516.24 A: but i'm 

516.51 519.46 A: i could even do that as an internet business 

519.34 520.14 B: (( uh-huh )) 

520.85 526.17 B: internet business oh yeah like astrology charts and all that 

522.25 523.30 A: yeah 

526.24 527.39 A: mhm 

526.86 528.32 B: astrology 

529.48 531.95 A: so i could do charts on the internet 

531.24 534.49 B: yeah that would be um nice idea 

535.15 536.12 A: but 

536.67 540.47 A: i don't it's sort of slow going at this point 

539.47 541.17 B: (( are you astrologer )) 

541.45 543.90 A: i've done astrology charts 

542.85 545.15 B: oh oh 

544.81 546.01 A: yeah 

545.71 546.59 B: (( good )) 

547.34 548.70 A: (( and ah )) 

549.19 553.82 A: i had my chart done in india they did with ah vedic astrology 

550.96 551.65 B: (( mhm )) 

553.51 554.24 B: (( mhm )) 

554.29 555.87 A: and um 

556.03 558.69 A: it's always very interesting to see the 

558.84 561.30 A: the similarities and the differences 

560.96 561.92 B: mhm 

561.61 563.43 A: between the systems 

563.17 564.25 B: yeah 

565.25 566.06 A: but 

567.66 568.56 A: how 

569.81 573.24 B: are you going to start an internet business 

574.40 575.41 A: do i want 

574.92 577.36 B: do you have a faith of astrology 

577.59 585.45 A: well i i actually s- have a i've s- s- saved a d._n._s. name you know you can get 'em for 

585.25 586.05 B: uh-huh 

585.54 587.46 A: thirty five dollars at a whack 

587.09 587.98 B: yeah 

587.54 590.54 A: called astrology charts about u._s. 

590.35 591.13 B: oh 

591.70 596.46 A: but it's a matter of putting together a web page and getting it out there and 

596.35 597.35 B: mhm 

596.98 599.95 A: seeing if there would be any response
