194.21 196.30 B: i don't know he's thinking that'll sway public opinion 

196.49 201.29 B: towards the war more than against it cause a lot of people are really against it now so who knows 

201.30 204.52 A: yeah they might have some secret weapon 

203.87 210.22 B: yeah who knows who knows what's going to happen everything's so uncertain but yeah i'm scared to fly also when are you le- when are you supposed to leave
