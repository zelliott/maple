59.92 60.37 B: mhm 

62.37 64.56 A: i i i think i have a lot of good ideas and uh 

64.97 67.80 A: think i have the organizational skills to make it succeed but uh 

68.58 71.78 A: i don't uh discount the fact that i'd probably need some some help uh 

72.36 73.53 A: definitely not good with uh 

73.90 75.01 A: number crunching or 

75.40 76.74 A: keeping books so i think that 

76.52 76.97 B: yeah 

77.09 78.64 A: be one area i i could use help with 

79.19 80.56 B: just have to hire an accountant 

80.12 82.20 A: exactly 

84.66 85.41 B: so 

86.75 89.76 B: um what was the other thing that they said how we would 

90.09 91.55 B: go about making it happen 

91.51 92.71 A: huh i think so yeah 

93.91 94.47 B: um 

96.90 101.14 B: well i think if i were going to start a business i would probably have to 

101.56 103.94 B: i don't know i'd have to get financing from a bank 

104.56 105.45 B: and then 

106.93 114.49 B: um i think real estate location makes a big difference because if you're kind of in some out of the way spot you're going to have a lot harder time finding business 

115.22 115.80 B: um 

116.57 117.43 B: and then would 

118.74 122.45 B: i think i would start advertising and just hiring sales people so that 

122.99 125.15 B: i don't know that's probably how i would go about doing it 

127.19 129.71 A: yeah i i think along the same lines i would uh i think 

127.30 127.69 B: so 

130.03 131.26 A: first step would be uh 

132.46 134.16 A: trying to get financing and uh 

135.85 136.70 A: see if i've ha- 

136.83 139.21 A: if i knew of any- anyone else that would be interested in in uh 

140.22 140.91 A: joining me 

141.34 143.73 A: hopefully they're stronger in areas that i'm not strong in 

144.01 144.47 B: mhm 

146.19 147.76 A: next i think would be just advertising 

150.07 153.77 A: definitely the internet would would come into play somewhere i'm not sure where just yet but 

154.07 154.50 B: mhm 

154.73 155.94 A: definitely be able to use that 

157.17 158.55 B: so now where are you 

158.82 159.53 B: located 

159.75 160.73 A: uh i'm in new york 

161.00 161.90 B: oh you're in new york 

162.33 163.18 A: what about yourself amy 

163.14 163.88 B: i'm in utah 

164.10 164.42 A: okay 

164.84 165.24 B: so 

166.18 170.17 B: yeah so would you be interested in doing real estate in 

170.54 170.97 B: like 

171.12 173.32 B: within the city or more in the suburbs 

173.42 173.92 A: um 

174.51 175.54 A: at this point it it's 

176.23 177.44 A: not really sure um 

178.69 181.42 A: probably would not mind getting into real estate here in new york 

181.83 182.22 B: mhm 

182.30 182.76 A: but 

182.98 183.50 A: think i 

184.10 184.53 A: pretty 

184.69 186.35 A: pretty competitive market here so 

186.95 188.49 A: i don't want to get in over my head so i 

189.02 191.02 A: probably would want to try to start somewhere 

191.62 192.10 A: a little 

192.56 194.08 A: little more slow paced and then uh 

194.94 196.17 A: work up the courage to uh 

196.88 197.94 A: do it here in new york city 

198.19 198.57 B: yeah 

200.43 201.28 B: that's interesting 

202.17 203.55 B: i've never even been to new york 

204.49 205.49 A: wh- where in utah are you 

205.74 206.59 B: i'm in provo 

207.95 209.19 A: i'm not sure where that is 

208.05 208.59 B: so 

209.35 209.75 B: it's 

210.10 210.51 B: it's just 

210.61 212.46 B: like an hour south of salt lake 

212.51 212.88 A: okay 

213.18 213.70 B: um 

213.95 216.43 B: yeah i just graduated from school last year and 

219.65 221.80 B: hanging out i guess while my husband finishes school 

222.42 222.89 A: got you 

225.68 226.22 B: well 

227.25 228.79 A: think that was was that everything 

229.42 230.38 B: i think so 

231.97 235.97 B: i'm not sure are we supposed to do anything else or are we just get done and hang up 

236.25 237.82 A: i wa- i was hoping that we would 

238.54 240.53 A: that the operator would come back on but 

242.09 243.04 B: hm i don't know 

243.36 245.47 B: so how did you sign up for the study 

246.10 246.56 A: um 

247.14 249.42 A: i got a friend of mine had just sent me an email 

249.55 250.64 A: telling me about it and 

250.82 251.28 B: mhm 

251.38 251.77 A: that 

252.22 253.30 A: you get paid for it so 

253.58 254.46 B: yeah 

254.10 254.42 A: yeah 

255.00 255.93 A: can't argue with that 

256.69 257.11 B: yup 

257.20 257.86 A: what about yourself 

257.85 261.52 B: well i um i graduated in linguistics from 

261.77 263.38 B: brigham young university 

263.09 263.43 A: okay 

263.56 265.10 B: and so 

265.27 269.58 B: i got an email from the department saying they were doing a language study and i was like well that 

269.69 270.50 B: could be interesting 

271.32 271.68 B: so 

272.39 273.91 B: that was kind of why i signed up 

274.32 276.20 A: huh very interesting i i wonder who 

276.79 277.30 A: wha- what do you 

277.44 278.20 A: what do you think 

278.84 279.45 A: the study 

280.02 280.87 A: would was doing 

282.16 288.68 B: uh i don't know i wonder if they're listening to different accents or if they're listening for 

290.50 290.77 B: just 

291.96 292.63 B: i don't know s- 

292.82 295.02 B: speech interaction or i'm not sure 

295.81 303.82 B: i thought it was kind of interesting um because they said it was a language study and they were going to try to get people from different areas of the country and you know they asked where 

302.53 303.01 A: right 

303.96 305.63 B: where i grew up and so 

306.23 310.12 B: i don't know i wonder if it has something to do with accents or just differences in 

311.11 312.40 B: in you know the way that we 

313.52 314.40 B: i don't know our s- 

314.55 315.10 B: -peech 

315.49 319.18 B: clues and how we interact in just different parts of the country i'm not sure so 

319.45 320.30 A: huh do you do you think 

320.94 321.43 A: did they 

321.53 321.80 A: does 

322.00 324.27 A: a live person analyze our our calls or 

324.92 325.42 A: did they have 

325.58 327.23 A: you know computer programs that can do that 

327.64 329.27 B: i don't know i have no idea i would 

328.98 329.44 A: okay 

329.82 332.28 B: if i were going to do it i would probably have a live person do it 

332.39 332.69 B: but 

333.49 334.01 B: i don't know 

334.39 335.22 A: i would think you would ha- 

334.47 335.61 B: interesting thought at least 

335.64 337.37 A: i would think you would have to have someone live 

337.52 337.93 A: but then 

338.29 338.68 B: yeah 

339.06 340.62 A: then i would also imagine that that 

341.38 342.53 A: would leave a lot of uh 

343.34 343.96 A: room for 

344.08 344.40 A: you know 

344.69 347.34 A: different people i'm sure would interpret dip- different things differently 

347.64 351.36 B: yeah well there's no uh i mean if it was something that had to do with like 

351.75 353.31 B: um phonetics and this 

353.43 353.88 B: different 

354.53 359.78 B: you know the different way that we pronounce things there's a lot of computers and machines they use to help with 

360.21 361.66 B: analyzing that i guess 

361.65 362.38 A: oh okay 

362.49 362.98 A: interesting 

363.34 365.49 B: yeah i don't know i thought it would be kind of interesting to sign up 

366.67 366.98 B: but 

368.93 369.79 B: well 

369.73 371.32 A: i i guess i guess we're just 

372.83 373.29 A: respect to the 

373.63 374.30 A: food ourself 

374.66 376.24 B: i guess so 

376.69 378.34 B: well it was nice talking with you
