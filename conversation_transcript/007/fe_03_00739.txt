14.10 16.34 A: so how do we draw the line between 

18.83 21.20 B: if it's just filth it's not comedy 

21.72 22.15 B: to me 

22.89 26.52 B: i mean there is some cursing that's okay but there's a line there 

27.50 29.52 A: so what do you do when you're offended by something 

29.95 31.22 B: i leave 

30.88 35.76 A: you leave i don't i actually don't get offended by much unless it's 

36.02 37.64 A: you know racist or 

37.33 42.12 B: yeah i mean yeah racist like that i'll leave i mean but most of it's kind of fun and i can over look it 

37.94 39.05 A: derogatory towards 

41.99 42.60 A: mhm 

42.98 43.96 B: who's your favorite comedian 

57.77 58.59 B: uh-huh 

59.28 62.45 B: like robin williams whoopie goldberg 

61.03 61.80 A: i'm not really 

62.38 65.26 A: yeah i'm not really fond of robbie williams quite honestly not because of 

64.62 65.28 B: do you like whoopie 

65.67 67.65 A: yeah i like her i mean when i've seen her 

68.02 68.93 B: oh yeah she's funny 

69.11 70.48 A: yeah where where are you from 

70.43 73.41 B: i'm from i'm from louisiana but i'm in takoma washington now

74.90 78.51 A: i'm from originally from cleveland but i live in michigan now 

78.49 82.11 B: oh we're long ways away glad they're paying for the call 

79.68 81.07 A: yeah oh 

81.66 84.89 A: yeah i was just wondering if if if region or um 

85.44 88.49 A: you know if there are comedians that are more popular in certain places 

88.54 89.03 B: i don't know 

89.41 92.12 B: i don't know i love stand up comedy i love going to comedy clubs 

92.22 93.54 B: and i love watching them on t._v. 

95.10 105.71 A: yeah i guess you know i'm thinking about the the question being draw the line kind of stuff and i'm thinking you know in a comedy club if you're offended you can walk out or you know what kind of humor and if it's not your style you don't go 

102.73 103.55 B: yeah 

104.29 106.87 B: what do you consider drawing the line just racist 

107.50 108.38 A: well 

113.37 113.73 B: mhm 

115.49 116.00 B: mhm 

119.27 119.75 B: yeah 

126.19 129.67 A: trying to figure out why is it okay in this situation but not in that 

131.65 132.63 B: yeah 

135.10 136.13 B: oh 

135.64 137.32 A: you know i'm always think they often 

137.74 143.92 A: the often say things that that are inappropriate in an attempt to be humorous not not of a sexual or racial nature but 

141.73 142.20 B: uh-huh 

144.34 149.28 A: where they cross over the line between what's acceptable joking with a teach and what's not 

149.05 150.02 B: uh-huh 

149.76 152.18 A: i mean i was just thinking you know they they don't have that sense of 

152.58 154.83 A: of registering appropriateness 

154.61 155.23 B: uh-huh 

154.96 155.40 A: so like 

155.49 160.63 A: um i was just telling this about this the other day because um as a teacher i've made fun of myself right you know i say something 

160.35 161.09 B: oh yeah 

160.87 170.90 A: you know i ask my students you know if someone says something okay how many of you agree raise your hand and you know a couple people agree how many of you disagree raise your hand okay what about the rest of you how many of you just don't care how many you know can't wait to get out 

167.31 167.66 B: uh-huh 

169.80 171.44 B: yeah you get a lot of i don't cares 

171.26 180.44 A: right right so you know make those kinds of jokes but when the sometimes it comes back at me where the students initiate a joke at my expense that's not funny you know what i mean 

179.77 181.40 B: no it's it's never is 

181.09 186.65 A: yeah and i always think gosh how i'm kind of setting them up for that and i don't know how to 

186.76 188.99 A: i don't always know how to deal with that and sometimes i then 

189.17 198.74 A: compound it by making another joke saying you know things like okay if you guys want to do well in this class something you should learn right away is never make fun of your teacher you know i kind of joke back with them but sometimes with with 

196.63 197.26 B: yeah 

198.85 200.86 A: yeah some students they don't always 

201.00 202.34 A: they don't always get the subtly 

201.27 202.69 B: what do you what kind of students 

202.79 203.12 A: pardon 

203.44 204.39 B: what kind of students

206.47 207.02 B: oh 

210.04 211.03 B: uh-huh 

210.59 212.12 A: and so you know the 

213.30 219.72 A: what is funny is very culturally based and then whether who you where that kind of stuff so i teach a lot of international students 

216.08 216.74 B: uh-huh 

218.22 218.72 B: yeah 

219.92 221.19 A: that are learning english and they 

220.17 220.53 B: yeah 

221.37 229.99 A: sometimes you know they hear a joke so they want to repeat and they don't always know where that line is and and you know maybe i don't either 

222.02 222.52 B: uh-huh 

226.62 228.24 B: yeah that's true 

229.49 231.01 B: yes sometimes we don't 

230.69 231.59 A: yeah huh 

232.32 234.73 A: but i have i mean i i've been when i think about being around 

234.90 240.74 A: family i think sometimes you know extending family from a different generation that finds certain kinds of humor 

238.88 239.63 B: uh-huh
