59.78 60.18 B: yeah 

61.81 62.42 A: constantly 

62.73 64.01 B: yeah we're human 

64.08 66.47 A: to protect ourselves or to protect somebody else 

66.87 68.29 A: and basically that uh 

68.44 69.56 A: that's all they're asking there 

70.06 70.49 B: yeah 

71.90 77.57 A: but the reproductions of perjury are a whole lot bigger usually then telling your kids that uh 

77.97 78.86 B: exactly 

79.14 80.17 B: yeah there's b- 

84.27 87.64 B: so do they get back on the phone now or do i just talk to you about it 

87.35 90.43 A: i think that we just talk to each other for ten min- 

90.77 96.45 A: discuss th- the topic and then that's the way that i understood it anyway and then after ten minutes uh 

95.06 95.42 B: oh 

97.37 97.92 A: we're done 

98.43 99.35 B: oh okay 

100.58 102.80 A: it may be hard to talk for ten minutes about this though 

103.33 104.73 B: yeah it could be 

105.87 106.59 B: i um 

108.41 110.70 B: yeah i think it'd be pretty easy to lie 

110.97 111.77 B: in court 

111.98 113.56 B: for a family member 

113.67 114.84 B: or a really close friend 

115.77 118.73 A: probably easier to do that for them then it would be for your self 

119.25 119.89 B: yeah 

120.61 121.25 A: because 

122.34 124.11 A: you know morally you may feel 

125.86 127.51 A: obligated not to perjure 

128.99 132.79 A: testimony about yourself and i'm assuming they're probably talking about some kind of criminal perjury 

133.47 136.96 A: uh i i guess any lie could be considered a perjury in a sense 

137.38 137.84 B: yeah 

138.37 138.64 A: but 

139.15 141.82 A: you know if if you're 

142.63 145.08 A: morally you may you may fe- 

145.68 150.02 A: the strain but if you're talking about protecting a close family member or a close friend 

150.61 154.47 A: then it would be a lot easier to say the- they're more important then my self so i can 

157.81 159.16 A: mother or what father wouldn't 

159.33 162.98 A: perjure themselves 

163.31 165.02 B: yeah exactly 

165.73 167.22 B: you think of some of these people 

167.82 169.99 B: you know who have the death penalty 

170.41 171.59 B: (( )) that's a good one 

172.03 172.69 A: what was that again 

173.59 176.60 B: well some of these people who are going against say 

178.33 179.32 A: oh sure exactly 

186.17 190.59 A: well since i'm opposed to the death penalty anyway i would probably do that for anybody 

191.30 191.80 B: yeah 

192.33 195.94 A: i mean regardless well that's that's a tough point though to 

196.13 200.56 A: you- be tr- if if you perjured yourself enough you might turn somebody loose that committed a heinous crime 

201.00 201.43 B: yeah 

202.58 202.99 A: but 

204.09 206.57 A: the the penalty itself is so is 

206.70 208.07 A: itself so heinous 

208.41 209.99 A: and the death penalty are capital offenses 

210.69 212.79 A: that i have to think really hard about that 

218.71 220.06 A: you think we're talking to fast 

223.10 224.71 B: never did this before 

231.76 232.32 B: mhm 

234.30 238.10 A: well it really doesn't matter what we say because they have to pay us anyway if they're going to pay us 

239.24 243.52 A: and basically that's your motivation i'm sure because that's my motivation 

243.31 244.48 B: ah exactly 

244.65 247.05 B: i'm just watching this space shuttle stuff 

247.23 248.28 A: oh wasn't that terrible 

249.06 249.87 B: awful 

250.96 251.66 A: and you know 

251.13 254.00 B: been watching it for two hours its kind of nice t- 

253.29 253.86 A: (( )) 

254.06 258.41 A: really ironic thing about that was i just watched apollo thirteen on t._v. the other day 

258.96 259.71 B: oh really 

260.27 261.92 A: and that struck home on that 

262.36 263.02 A: have you seen that one 

263.30 264.15 B: no umhum 

264.96 265.51 B: is it good 

265.72 266.65 A: oh it's excellent 

267.46 267.79 A: (( uh )) 

268.23 272.02 A: tom ah hank's is in it and of course i'm sure you knew who was all in it 

270.27 271.11 B: oh he's always 

272.19 272.72 A: they had a 

273.54 277.41 A: a period when they were coming back on re-entry where they lost contact and lost communication and they 

278.22 283.58 A: flashed that on the t._v. earlier this morning that they lost communication and that's the first thing that came to mind that situation there and that 

285.33 286.67 B: boy it's just sad though 

289.54 291.60 A: yes it is and 

291.73 294.30 A: they they keep playing it on and on and on on t._v. 

294.42 299.91 B: i know and i keep watching it flipping channels thinking ah here's something new and i never do 

299.65 303.92 A: and and the sad faces of those people the ones who were on the on the eh 

304.90 305.41 A: it's amazing 

308.06 308.57 B: yeah 

309.16 312.61 B: with that um perjury thing though we were taking about um 

313.74 316.04 B: i was in a car accident a couple of years ago 

317.21 319.40 B: and i got a back injury out of it 

320.35 324.48 B: i'm going to going to court myself and i was kind of faced with that 

325.00 326.65 B: because it's a co-worker 

327.71 329.21 A: the other person involved in the accident with you 

329.96 332.49 B: well i was with a co-worker we were working 

333.23 334.05 B: you know and 

335.64 339.77 B: yo- i you know you don't know for sure but 

340.03 345.49 B: i really think was her fault but the accident got put on to somebody the guy 

348.57 349.05 A: yes 

349.91 350.59 B: you know 

350.85 356.13 B: god i was just kind of thinking in court and say it's her fault or 

356.69 357.97 B: you know that's kind of were that 

358.17 359.17 B: perjury thing 

360.38 361.27 B: you know what i mean 

361.47 366.24 A: yeah yeah in a classical sense it would be but you know when you get into court on something like that you have to 

367.43 368.62 A: your not really allowed to 

370.85 372.07 A: you have to answer questions 

372.24 374.40 A: there not act- there not actually wanting you to 

375.23 375.57 A: (( )) 

393.28 394.22 A: or if you believed 

394.91 396.03 A: situation was not 

397.91 401.09 A: what there trying to make it out to be and yet you didn't you didn't 

401.48 403.78 A: volunteer information that was not asked for 

404.73 405.52 B: i see 

406.35 406.83 A: um 

407.22 412.10 A: uh i- it it would be a thin line i suppose but not necessarily a 

412.92 414.52 A: perjury if if a 

414.63 416.21 A: if you withheld information 

417.00 420.32 A: because it wasn't asked for because technically you're not supposed to 

421.23 422.97 A: answer things that aren't asked anyway 

423.17 423.67 B: yeah 

423.25 424.45 A: because they ca- they can 

424.57 424.96 A: ah 

427.19 428.07 A: block that 

429.77 431.06 A: now eh eh a 

431.21 433.31 A: i would say that you could you could probably 

433.56 435.43 A: talk with the attorneys and a 

435.57 436.82 A: tell them if it if it 

438.07 439.02 A: was an issue for you 

439.62 440.19 B: yeah 

440.78 445.88 B: well i'm just thinking that it's going to come in your or in your opinion you know i can just hear them 

446.00 450.19 B: whose fault was the accident you know and i'm going to be sitting there like 

450.92 453.94 B: i don't know is the best i can think of to say 

453.97 457.15 A: would if you say that though and you've already had the opinion that you- 

457.26 457.65 A: think 

457.98 461.25 A: the other person may have been at fault then i guess at that point you would have perjured yourself 

463.90 464.25 B: (( )) 

467.67 470.16 B: so it's kind of relevant to what were taking about i guess 

470.28 472.15 A: it's exactly relevant to what were taking about 

470.32 470.80 B: yeah 

473.58 473.99 B: huh 

474.92 478.24 B: but yeah like having a daughter and i don't know do you have any children 

478.35 479.27 A: oh yeah i've got three 

479.62 480.12 B: yeah 

480.79 484.10 B: i mean if it was for them and say they were against eh 

484.37 487.64 B: life imprisonment or death penalty or what-not 

486.77 488.87 A: do do you think it would have to be that serious though 

489.02 489.72 A: i mean 

490.45 490.78 A: for your 

496.21 500.40 A: and suspended from school because some activity that they were involved in they didn't show up and they told 

507.59 511.34 A: back them up on that knowing that if you don't they're going to be suspended 

514.35 515.28 B: on that i don't 

515.42 516.53 B: i don't think i would 

517.81 521.83 B: cause i want i'd want my child to learn the sense of responsibility 

522.64 524.04 B: where as where as you know 

524.46 530.39 B: it's not that big of a deal i mean yeah she'll get suspended from school and hopefully she'll learn her lesson 

530.99 535.08 B: where as if it was like prison or something like that well 

536.07 538.37 B: you know there's no turning back on that 

538.19 539.04 A: okay but but 

539.19 542.65 A: but take in the consideration that if your child gets suspended from school 

543.72 547.26 A: then an- and they're trying to get into an exclusive college 

548.40 553.14 A: and they take that into consideration that they've been suspended from school and they've been blocked out of a a 

553.29 553.60 A: a 

556.24 557.02 A: potential 

558.47 563.32 A: livelihood i mean you know if they wanted to get into a very exclusive school and they weren't allowed in there because of 

563.55 564.41 A: this behavior 

565.65 567.73 A: i mean would that make a difference then 

569.02 570.06 B: i don't think so 

571.69 573.10 B: i don't think it (( )) 

575.63 578.20 B: i really think that children need to learn 

577.95 579.70 A: the- they do they do need to learn 

579.12 581.00 B: and they need discipline and a 

581.97 584.07 B: that wouldn't be enough to make me lie 

585.56 588.25 B: it would have to be something very very serious i 

589.43 591.94 A: it- it would have to be something like a jail sentence or uh- 

593.00 593.70 B: yeah 

595.59 596.43 B: something like that 

597.24 598.71 A: what about i- if a
