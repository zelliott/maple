28.26 33.30 B: uh well okay uh i don't know much about bioterrorism um 

34.80 36.56 B: what can we do to prevent it 

36.33 37.28 A: yeah 

39.00 39.41 B: oh 

49.90 50.37 A: threat if 

51.49 54.60 B: well yeah i think the thing that bothers me the most about 

54.79 64.36 B: well that is the most difficult because terrorism is that uh the people who are doing it are willing to sacrifice their lives so if it is a suicide mission 

65.14 66.01 B: um 

66.28 68.66 B: it is kind of hard to provide human 

68.85 77.61 B: deterrence for something like that when someone is willing to um die in the process so what is the retribution they go to jail you know 

70.96 71.71 A: exactly 

77.82 86.44 A: exactly that that is why i say they want to die and then we will do it you know they just die at our hand i you know i don't want to die at their hand and 

88.17 93.82 A: i think what they are doing you know going over their with the inspections is good but i don't think it is going to be enough really 

96.19 96.99 A: ahead of somebody 

99.30 104.45 B: um was there something recent about bioterrorism with with the inspections i may i may have missed that 

104.15 116.06 A: no no i just think because that's been since september eleventh that's been you know there what could happen next you know and i think that is why they made it a topic because it is still 

116.49 118.21 A: a threat per se you know 

118.88 123.08 B: okay so like um anthrax would that be considered bioterrorism 

122.46 126.88 A: yeah yeah i asked my husband i'm like what is bioterrorism 

127.96 131.19 A: (( )) i had to i had to find out really quick 

132.16 135.23 A: but yeah anything i guess chemical type warfare 

134.76 137.28 B: or poisoning the water system or 

136.12 137.32 A: yes 

137.54 138.23 A: yeah 

138.61 142.39 B: i mean we did that in vietnam with the agent orange and 

142.77 144.15 B: defoliants and 

145.29 146.05 B: um 

147.33 154.78 B: i guess that was because we were fighting a war but uh you know the terrorists think they are fighting a war too we are we are the enemy whether 

153.07 154.13 A: exactly 

155.29 156.47 B: we believe it or not 

162.91 164.17 A: basically can go get a job as 

164.35 164.83 A: security 

165.33 169.34 A: i guess now that is a federal thing but you know with anything that can 

169.71 170.43 A: leach 

170.57 171.88 A: you know the water 

172.23 177.19 A: um i i think that they should you know have more of a background check people like that 

179.67 180.22 B: that (( )) 

181.69 185.80 B: i i don't i honestly i don't know what can be i mean there is only so much 

185.92 190.36 B: you can spend on inspection and uh 

190.80 200.53 B: and security i mean if if you know uh look at the anthrax thing all you had to do was put a little bit of powder on an envelope and put it in the u._s. mail and 

195.49 195.80 A: hm 

201.46 202.01 B: ach 

202.15 203.77 A: e- exactly yeah 

203.10 206.19 B: how do you stop someone from putting a letter in the u._s. mail 

206.23 210.19 A: yeah i- i- yeah how far can they go without taking away our freedom too 

210.21 210.65 B: mhm 

210.83 215.49 A: you know uh uh -cause they could they could you know check every single piece of mail before we mail it 

215.97 216.50 A: you know 

216.06 220.38 B: well then the thirty seven stamp cent stamp becomes a thirty seven dollar stamp uh 

219.69 221.40 A: oh yeah yup 

221.53 226.21 A: yup i i think no matter it is going to cost money for us one way or the other 

226.45 230.33 A: unfortunately you know and we are going to lose a little bit of freedom 

230.83 234.13 A: you know as as we have with nine eleven 

234.35 236.21 A: you can't just bring whatever you want to 

236.58 239.41 A: you know when you travel now everything has to be checked 

239.62 240.80 A: you know so 

241.11 243.67 A: you know i i think in a way they are winning but 

243.84 246.01 A: you know and and i think they can do things 

246.18 251.03 A: i don't know i'm just losing now 

250.47 251.97 B: where where are you from 

252.19 253.08 A: um new hampshire 

252.97 255.65 B: new hampshire okay i'm from the chicago area 

255.29 255.96 A: okay 

255.97 260.45 B: so have you traveled uh recently uh to outside of the country 

258.86 259.59 A: um n- 

260.19 270.75 A: no no no and uh probably i am one of the ones that will not get on the plane um after september eleventh i mean i had yeah i had fears before then 

268.05 268.93 B: oh really 

270.86 277.93 A: and that just did it for me you know and then you had the scare uh on the airplanes with the funny smell 

278.29 288.75 A: remember that was a little bit right after you know and i said okay that is it i'll stick to my own vehicle you know at least i i have control over the air i'm breathing on that 

279.38 280.49 B: yeah mhm 

290.11 290.67 A: but uh 

290.25 297.39 B: but you know i mean if the wh- if the effect of terrorism is to make people feel like they are prisoners in their own 

297.88 300.46 B: home and their own town i i think they are succeeding 

300.46 306.48 A: yeah yeah for for me i would agree with that yeah you know oh a lot of things 

306.96 310.52 A: i i would say that you know i continue day to day 

310.97 312.27 A: as i did before 

312.53 315.26 A: but you know it it stinks -cause i can't 

315.52 322.50 A: not look at somebody and wonder you know and and that's ruined it for me you know i i i second guess everything and everybody 

323.14 324.25 A: you know from um 

325.21 334.41 A: from what because someone was pissed off with us uh you know and they didn't like you know they don't like our freedom and so they are going to try to take it away from us and 

334.59 335.45 A: you know a- and 

336.34 339.24 A: i don't know i think they should have taken care of you know bush 

339.64 341.49 A: when he had uh um 

342.44 343.11 A: oh oh 

343.75 344.19 A: um 

344.30 345.04 A: years ago 

345.61 348.28 A: you know he i think it it should have ended then 

348.74 352.36 A: instead of giving him the years to where he is a threat again now 

351.88 352.37 B: mhm 

354.30 355.27 B: well um 

355.70 359.08 B: george's father will probably uh remind 

358.97 360.41 A: yeah 

361.16 364.56 B: w. that uh he has got some unfinished work 

364.45 371.14 A: yup yup and and well i wonder too though i wonder how much is is really politics out of all of that 

371.57 374.05 A: you know and if if if you want to 

374.16 382.90 A: you know really tear it down you know why didn't they do something about ten years ago you know what kind of deal was made underneath the table that none of us know about you know what i mean 

382.67 383.10 B: yeah 

383.98 389.07 A: -cause it all it is all politics one way or another it's my opinion you know um 

388.67 391.53 B: well something happened for them to stop just short of 

392.04 392.46 A: yes 

392.30 394.03 B: taking him out of power um 

393.63 394.76 A: yes yeah 

394.26 397.36 B: i can't believe they put a war on 

397.80 402.25 B: and then say oh okay we'll get down to the one yard line okay no we don't want a touchdown we just 

398.71 400.88 A: oh yeah 

401.78 411.91 A: yeah yup yeah we are all done now okay yeah yeah we and and and they sit back and wait for us to just to accept it and be like okay you know but 

412.49 418.59 A: i don't know i don't think the give the americans the credit that we deserve you know that we are not that stupid 

420.08 423.72 B: well i vote against it uh against bioterrorism 

423.49 425.59 A: yeah i i vote against it too 

424.97 428.64 B: okay so we've come to agreement and and consensus 

428.17 429.35 A: yes 

428.89 430.39 B: and uh 

429.82 433.40 A: now i don't know what else that we talk about 

433.89 436.25 A: we don't know how to get rid of it 

437.54 447.22 A: i don't know i think anyone that goes for uh maybe that works for chemicals that wants to you know go overseas should be watched maybe i don't know 

448.56 450.38 A: i really don't know 

450.95 452.93 B: did you watch the speech last night
