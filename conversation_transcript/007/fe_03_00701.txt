9.00 11.92 A: so we are supposed to talk about bioterrorism 

11.79 14.68 B: i think so i i have never done this before i don't know if you have 

14.28 16.11 A: uh i haven't either 

16.29 24.14 A: this is my first one also let's see it was what can the u._s. do to prevent bioterrorism if i remember correctly 

26.52 30.65 A: well i don't know much about bioterrorism except that it involves like 

31.04 33.07 A: nerve toxins and stuff like that 

34.55 37.86 A: i don't know if you heard anything i don't watch the news much i have a baby 

38.52 40.14 B: well i watch it a little bit 

41.68 43.68 B: i guess i guess they are going to need to uh 

43.99 44.42 B: um 

44.51 45.72 B: uh watch the airports 

46.67 47.70 B: you know a little bit more (( )) 

47.79 49.28 B: like the nine eleven attacks 

49.94 50.67 A: right 

51.22 54.30 A: well that was more of a security 

55.14 57.60 A: measure than really a bio- thing though 

58.53 61.19 B: yeah but any small plane could have you know carried that 

61.92 62.70 A: that is true 

63.11 64.06 A: like some kind of 

63.27 63.57 B: (( )) 

64.83 68.41 A: not to (( )) or anything but some kind of container that upon impact explodes 

69.55 70.32 A: and can spread 

69.56 72.98 B: i know i was watching the news right now in north carolina there is a fire down there 

73.49 75.80 B: they say it was internal but someone said it was a plane 

76.51 77.03 A: hm 

76.71 77.85 B: i mean it could happen anywhere 

78.42 80.43 B: you know that a plane could carry all these uh 

78.50 78.98 A: right 

80.89 81.43 B: chemicals 

82.50 83.02 A: right 

83.83 84.25 B: small plane 

85.56 86.26 A: do you think 

85.68 87.22 B: or any size plane for that matter 

87.53 88.07 A: yeah 

88.40 91.53 A: i mean it could be stored on a passenger plane and nobody would know about it 

92.19 94.09 A: if it was an inside job or something 

94.39 96.76 A: like those people loading the luggage in the bottom of a plane 

97.43 98.94 A: you know we don't know what they do down there 

99.27 101.69 B: just like the post office too when you have the anthrax 

102.15 103.44 A: right i remember that 

103.04 103.97 B: and they could be (( sent )) 

106.70 108.63 B: doesn't have to be anthrax it could be anything else 

109.29 109.88 A: yeah 

110.70 113.44 A: i'm really paranoid about opening my mail now because of all those (( )) 

113.61 115.23 A: when that was happening 

113.71 118.97 B: you are not the only one i was a little paranoid too when that was going on 

120.46 123.24 B: well you know you know you don't want to die because (( )) 

123.31 128.39 A: right well especially with a bill that would be upsetting you die from opening a bill 

130.32 131.23 B: well i guess um 

132.56 137.31 B: i guess we are just talking about it huh i thought there would be like a third party intervening at some 

137.16 138.84 A: no um they just 

137.78 139.95 B: suggestions or questions i don't know 

140.01 144.68 A: no they just want you to talk about it it is a linguistics study i think they are just studying the way people talk and 

144.87 147.25 A: different regions of the of the u._s. or something 

148.51 152.18 A: oh so i know my husband signed up with it and he did it yesterday and he just talked 

152.81 154.66 A: about i think it was terrorism yesterday 

154.80 156.49 B: oh really how long did he talk for 

157.14 157.96 A: um it is a ten minute 

158.45 158.80 A: study 

158.99 160.21 B: oh a ten minute study 

160.40 162.94 A: i i believe if i remember it correctly 

163.83 166.86 A: but i just know whenever the time is up it is like okay say goodbye and it 

167.23 168.78 A: it hangs you up 

168.73 169.82 B: oh okay 

169.09 171.16 A: it is kind it is kind of rude whenever it finishes 

172.01 174.33 B: -cause i know i take a lot of medications and whatnot 

174.45 175.91 B: i'm looking at some of them right now 

176.30 179.42 B: and i have a cough and whatnot and i'm going to a ear nose and throat specialist 

176.33 176.83 A: hm 

179.67 180.91 B: and you wonder about you know 

181.76 183.62 B: maybe some of those drugs being you know 

184.05 184.86 B: contaminated 

185.67 186.36 A: right 

186.36 188.52 B: just never know they can get into the system that way 

188.92 190.33 B: in our pharmaceutical system 

189.95 192.22 A: see i would 

192.87 194.12 A: i would prefer getting 

194.50 198.06 A: like pharmaceuticals and stuff that were made in the u._s. that way i'm 

198.18 200.41 A: more guaranteed that they are not going to be 

200.91 202.32 A: some crazy person putting 

202.57 203.49 A: whatever in there 

203.79 206.65 B: yeah a lot of people do go outside of the country because they are cheaper 

206.85 208.46 B: they go to different countries i don't know if you uh 

207.12 207.49 A: yeah 

208.77 209.44 B: heard about that 

210.08 213.27 A: well i i only take a few medications but i don't 

213.74 215.64 A: i don't know where they are manufactured 

215.59 221.03 B: i take five pills a day so and sometimes you try to get the generic brand you know 

217.90 218.57 A: oh wow 

218.74 219.14 A: yeah 

221.26 221.79 A: yeah 

221.75 223.65 B: even with the co-pay that is fifteen bucks 

224.09 224.55 A: mhm 

224.38 226.11 B: time to get a motor for each one 

227.73 230.24 A: oh yeah i know what you mean 

230.61 231.08 A: i take 

231.80 232.50 A: three pills 

233.12 233.40 A: but 

234.78 237.34 A: i think everybody nowadays is on medication that is a good way to 

237.61 239.63 A: not a good way but that would be an easy way to spread 

241.09 242.92 B: i know my wife has asthma and i'm taking 

241.23 242.16 A: something 

243.55 245.25 B: allegra you know the common one 

245.65 247.25 B: that are you know quite a bit of them 

245.73 246.15 A: hm 

247.54 249.06 B: singular too for my cough 

250.09 250.48 A: hm 

250.10 250.54 B: do you know 

250.70 253.83 B: you you just wonder you know maybe they could get into those areas 

255.51 256.88 A: -cause it is i don't know 

257.44 259.00 A: i'm not a big study on 

259.17 260.94 A: the human biology but 

262.08 264.77 A: you know any medications you take is going to go through your blood stream 

266.06 267.70 A: and depending on how you take it 

269.12 272.92 B: well (( )) and how i know with the i don't know if you get a chance to see the presidential talk 

269.43 269.80 A: (( )) 

274.34 275.59 A: i didn't see much of it 

276.92 281.45 B: it is a little scary because uh you know he is pushing all of what we are talking about 

280.85 283.08 A: oh that is probably why some of the topics are like this 

283.39 286.23 B: yup he is pushing all that stuff but they have it over there 

286.62 288.10 B: you know what are we going to do about it 

288.89 291.14 B: are we going to wait for them to attack us with it or 

291.29 292.09 B: you know are we going to 

292.77 294.47 B: prevent it by attacking them first 

296.23 297.82 A: oh i don't 

298.17 299.67 A: i don't like war 

300.25 302.36 A: sometimes yes i think it is necessary but 

303.65 304.13 A: i just 

305.36 310.89 A: i don't i don't like it i don't like fighting my husband thinks that we should all get in this big old game of 

311.10 312.86 A: paint ball 

312.98 316.37 A: and then like have like little miniature wars every year 

313.12 313.70 B: (( )) 

316.46 317.64 A: and then whoever wins

330.78 331.25 A: hm 

331.08 338.72 B: but he used to tell me that when a when a shell from another tank would go through your your tank it created a vacuum and it would suck you right out just like a liquid 

339.41 340.33 B: that is scary 

339.60 340.17 A: ouch
