134.75 140.45 A: there's actually a a place near where i live here that actually does that they bring in a- th- 

140.46 144.82 A: it's kind of a home but it's a huge area it's acreage where they bring in 

143.05 144.03 B: mhm 

144.86 154.83 A: actually exotic animals who you know for whatever reason zoos can't keep them anymore and so they started bringing them to their home and they've kind of got this exotic animal 

149.41 150.42 B: mhm 

154.39 155.52 B: (( i i )) 

155.75 158.17 B: i did consider that too and i-

159.83 161.00 A: [laughter] 

164.07 167.96 B: if i could treat them as wild and not try to make pets out of them 

167.71 175.09 A: yeah and i think it'd be difficult to at least they live you know next to a tiger and lions and [laughter] but 

175.18 178.99 A: yeah not in your home but like in your back yard 

175.43 176.71 B: it's interesting i 

177.27 187.30 B: have two small children too so that would always have to come into consideration in any anything any kind of business i would get into it'd have to be something that could be worked around 

181.19 182.53 A: right 

184.37 186.01 A: yeah 

187.41 189.91 B: soccer and school and everything else 

189.81 191.20 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

190.06 193.64 B: [laughter] that's wh- why i thought that maybe something 

193.92 200.47 B: like that would have a more flexible schedule but i don't know i mean animals need as much of your time as kids or more 

200.37 203.14 A: yeah but as a business maybe 

201.00 201.88 B: um 

203.42 204.24 A: (( ah ))

210.95 212.42 A: it money's not an 

213.82 215.47 A: yeah i think so 

215.59 216.91 A: i think so 

216.68 219.67 B: and you wouldn't be worried about traveling 

219.74 222.14 B: all over have you traveled before 

222.07 229.99 A: yeah i have actually um i have just returned from living overseas for a few years and did a lot of traveling in asia so 

227.91 228.91 B: oh that's 

230.06 241.13 A: um i felt fairly comfortable in in that aspect of it now the le- the legality of you know all of that would i don't know anything about any of that so 

231.70 232.58 B: mhm 

239.47 240.43 B: mhm 

241.32 244.82 A: um it's just a dream i guess i 

243.63 247.68 B: i've al yeah i've always wanted to travel i think australia would be one of the 

247.69 248.95 A: think it would be too 

247.80 250.03 B: one of the places i'd like to ah 

250.53 251.48 B: to go 

251.65 254.67 B: but i definitely do love all the ah 

255.09 257.47 B: the african and um 

258.36 260.99 B: african cult- culture and the art 

261.07 262.31 A: mhm 

261.53 268.29 B: and ah some of the middle eastern stuff is beautiful the rugs and [laughter] all the different things that you can get there 

265.55 267.26 A: oh yeah 

268.38 269.90 A: (( [laughter] )) 

268.65 271.69 B: i think you could make a a big profit really 

271.50 273.78 A: i think so probably 

273.34 274.36 B: (( ah huh )) 

274.25 278.52 A: so that's you know another side of it i suppose but i don't know if i would 

278.80 286.32 A: necessarily be good at the managing of the business ah my father in law owns his own business and i know it's 

281.59 283.40 B: mhm mhm 

286.45 289.39 A: it's a never ending task for him to keep 

290.00 293.38 A: you know all the different aspects of the business in order 

293.31 305.39 B: that that sounds a little daunting to me too but if money's no object you can always hire people to do everything but you know that's that's a very far fetched concept for me money being no object 

293.42 294.39 A: (( you know )) 

299.94 300.94 A: yeah 

304.96 306.97 A: (( [laughter] me also ))

314.85 317.72 B: yes but but um 

317.82 318.62 B: i 

319.19 330.84 B: i that is something you know i would to ha- i would love to have that problem [laughter] to be to have to figure that one out in truth i guess the check's in the mail i suppose [laughter] 

323.55 325.38 A: [laughter] 

326.28 328.03 A: [laughter] i agree 

329.50 331.86 A: yeah that would be 

331.42 333.63 B: (( [laughter] )) 

333.10 339.13 A: nice [laughter] speaking of animals my dog keeps coming up and pawing at me he doesn't like it when i talk on the telephone so 

336.25 337.22 B: oh 

338.56 341.10 B: oh neither do my kids so

356.71 357.82 A: yeah 

357.09 362.19 B: oh w- would there be a there would definitely be a market in your area for 

362.54 363.68 B: for the 

363.84 364.80 A: (( i )) 

364.59 366.52 B: things that you would want to bring in 

367.18 377.67 A: don't know that actually um i live in a college town so probably not here because college students don't kids don't have extra money for that sort of things but maybe 

370.21 371.12 B: mhm

381.35 382.05 B: (( there )) 

382.07 388.25 B: may be professors and [laughter] and people that work at the college might enjoy things like that 

386.41 387.63 A: that's true 

388.05 393.18 A: i didn't think about about them i'm trying to think if there's anything like that here besides pier one 

392.66 393.72 B: uh-huh 

393.39 398.28 A: and i can't think of anything in spec- specifically so
