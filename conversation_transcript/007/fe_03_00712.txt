0.97 1.58 B: hello 

1.88 2.45 A: hello 

2.49 3.54 B: hello 

3.04 4.13 A: hi i'm maureen 

4.14 7.20 B: hi i'm deanna i've never done this so 

5.29 9.61 A: (( i know )) me either it's a first time for me so 

8.06 12.76 B: okay good okay so i guess we're suppose to talk on bio-terrorism 

13.32 15.62 A: yeah looks that way 

14.97 17.37 B: alright so 

16.88 19.32 A: hm what what do we 

18.04 21.14 B: yeah what exactly do we say 

19.51 22.10 A: well they want to know what we think 

22.42 22.72 A: that 

23.00 25.31 A: we can do in the u._s. about bio-terrorism 

25.96 27.36 A: and that is a very good question 

27.69 28.33 B: (( )) that's 

28.43 29.73 B: something to think about 

29.83 30.37 A: truthfully 

30.48 32.88 A: i don't think there is a damn thing they can do about it 

33.22 38.29 B: i know what can you do you don't know if anybody is going to do anything or you can't you know tell ahead of time 

38.76 42.40 A: right an and it's not like it's something that like anthrax they can stop through the mail 

42.80 43.56 B: yeah (( )) 

42.85 45.24 A: apparently they can't 

43.97 48.16 B: yeah exactly we we've proven that i don't know what else like 

46.96 47.79 A: right 

48.81 49.30 B: hm 

49.92 50.79 B: how can they 

52.49 57.21 B: and they've already upped security and stuff at like airports and you know 

57.57 62.82 A: well i mean the fact that people ship stuff into the u._s. every day boats airplanes 

62.58 63.03 B: mhm 

63.58 64.81 A: they don't check it very well 

65.06 65.93 B: yeah that's true 

66.31 68.81 B: they could just up security or 

66.54 67.51 A: so 

69.25 70.17 B: i don't know 

70.73 79.14 B: instead of paying so much money on other stuff they should worry about stuff like that because there is so much friv- frivolous stuff that you know they pay for that 

79.77 81.64 B: we could use for security and 

82.59 83.20 B: i don't know 

83.62 86.19 A: no but the fact is is that they can't crack down ones 

86.30 87.39 A: stupid stuff like 

87.90 94.33 A: getting knives on airplanes and shit how are they suppose to stop people from sending stuff in the mail 

91.39 91.96 B: yeah 

93.69 95.22 B: exactly yeah i get it 

94.91 95.49 A: i mean that 

95.60 106.09 A: the only way to get around that would be to stop anything or anyone from coming into the u._s. and and that's not going to cut it either because there are already people here who are probably doing that kind of crap 

100.34 101.81 B: and that's not possible 

105.44 106.04 B: mhm 

107.59 109.51 B: so what would you do 

109.70 112.51 B: i mean i don't know 

113.31 116.66 B: that is an a really really good question i just 

117.35 118.09 B: i don't know 

118.31 121.03 A: one without a whole lot of answers apparently 

119.87 122.77 B: i know like y- ju- it's hard to think about because there 

122.35 122.88 A: are eh 

123.39 129.77 B: i mean that it's such a big thing right now you know like we're in the middle of something that has to do with that but 

129.37 129.73 A: right 

129.90 130.59 B: nothing is 

131.26 132.66 B: happening obviously 

132.79 135.53 B: and so i mean uh well 

135.54 139.70 A: i don't know the fact is with technology the way it is it's easy to get things from 

139.99 142.75 A: here to just about anywhere 

142.17 143.69 B: oh yeah and there is so many 

142.97 143.53 A: within 

143.90 146.22 B: more people who know how to get into computers and 

146.37 147.93 B: hack everything so 

149.48 150.54 A: the fact is 

149.52 152.31 B: you could do just about anything right now 

151.04 156.84 A: right we can't stop computer viruses half the time how are we going to stop people from mailing stuff 

156.60 157.53 B: exactly 

158.44 159.58 B: uh i don't know 

160.94 164.45 B: i mean what do you say i've never done this so 

163.48 170.63 A: right me either well i wish i i'm thinking i wished i'd picked last night's topic 

168.60 175.42 B: i know i was trying to get my i._d. number down too and i couldn't get it so i didn't get last night's either 

175.62 176.42 A: um uh 

175.64 176.29 B: but 

176.61 178.70 A: well let's see what else 

181.16 183.95 A: well like (( you said )) i think the easiest way to get it would be through the mail 

184.19 185.18 A: and unfortunately 

185.53 186.63 A: there is no way around that 

186.71 187.22 B: mhm 

189.30 190.35 A: i mean the fact is 

189.65 190.35 B: (( )) 

191.06 191.52 A: somebody 

192.40 196.99 A: sends something on a plane and they don't get on with it well that's not their problem 

197.07 198.06 B: yeah yeah 

199.35 200.25 B: i think that 

200.66 207.37 B: i don't like it just comes down to security but what can you do more you know uh than we're already doing 

207.68 208.24 A: right 

208.44 210.77 B: i mean i guess security could be upped but 

208.53 209.37 A: um we have this 

211.54 212.69 A: we have a (( )) 

214.34 216.22 A: i mean unfortunately it's not like 

217.26 219.47 A: it's not like they cover all the territory 

220.12 220.56 B: yeah 

220.71 221.91 B: yeah that's true 

221.28 224.38 A: and i would say that's probably the only thing that you could use 

224.78 225.46 A: other than 

225.57 228.39 A: you know high-tech machinery to actually 

228.49 230.93 A: test something like that 

229.97 230.46 B: mhm 

231.45 235.51 A: (( there going through )) every package that comes through to the u._s. everyday 

236.16 238.25 A: uh that sounds like it's going to cost a lot of money 

238.41 240.68 B: mhm and you see like they only like 

241.05 248.52 B: from what i heard they only you know test like every other one or something so what if that one in the middle was the one and i mean i guess 

247.16 248.24 A: right 

248.98 253.53 B: it it makes sense because there is no way that they can go through and test everything because if they did it 

253.94 255.62 B: nothing would go through anywhere 

256.07 257.08 B: it's take so long 

257.81 258.43 B: but 

259.59 260.46 A: right so 

259.65 262.62 B: i don't know like but by doing every other one that one in the middle is 

260.72 261.08 A: i mean (( )) 

263.25 263.94 B: could be the one 

264.29 267.60 A: i guess the real the real question is is it worth the inconvenience 

264.40 266.13 B: or 

268.21 269.08 B: (( oh yeah )) 

268.40 271.69 A: and that's the biggest problem is apparently it's not worth the inconvenience 

272.26 274.29 A: because we want our mail and we want it today 

275.15 278.05 A: and we don't want it to take any longer than it already does 

277.77 278.89 B: yeah exactly 

279.29 281.07 A: (( and know we aren't really going to get around to it )) 

281.81 285.24 A: as if people actually take the time to say well it's that important 

285.50 285.98 B: mhm 

286.77 289.32 A: to test every single piece of mail that goes through 

289.41 289.92 B: mhm 

289.95 293.38 A: whether it be everything from envelopes to big packages 

293.54 296.21 B: yeah that that is totally true 

296.60 298.66 B: so it does boil down to that because i mean 

298.88 299.74 B: you know there is 

300.38 301.41 B: i don't know it just 

302.95 305.90 B: if everybody else has to do it in a sense too so 

306.76 310.94 B: what really can they do unless everybody else is in on it too you know 

306.80 307.47 A: right 

311.72 312.49 B: i don't know 

312.93 314.19 A: well i mean i mean what 

314.78 318.43 A: with everything else that's going on the fact is people are already here 

319.10 321.13 A: and if they want to do something they're going to do it 

320.94 321.42 B: mhm 

322.40 323.36 B: and they already have 

322.68 323.47 A: i mean (( until )) 

323.70 329.27 A: so it's not just a matter of you know everything that comes into the u._s. it's everything that's already here in the u._s. 

329.19 329.63 B: yeah 

329.97 333.05 A: because i guarantee you if they want to get it here it's already here 

334.82 337.50 B: yeah yeah that's true 

338.03 338.65 B: uh 

339.23 340.65 A: it's a fact of life anymore 

340.83 341.73 B: yeah 

341.47 347.25 A: but that's shit that they have to worry about but nobody wants to put the money put to do it just like the airlines don't want to put the money out 

347.37 347.63 A: to 

348.29 351.15 A: do all the testing they should be doing on luggage and 

351.83 352.83 A: on passengers 

352.95 353.53 B: mhm 

354.78 355.58 B: totally true 

356.92 364.89 B: i don't know i mean what else is there to elaborate on it it's a huge topic but it's generalized into one certain thing you know and so i mean 

364.44 365.27 A: right 

366.23 368.62 B: what else can you say 

369.27 373.82 B: and the fact the thing that is so hard to describe about it too is it's an issue right now 

374.15 376.32 B: and we're trying to work through it right now 

374.16 375.00 A: right 

377.45 381.00 B: you can't say anything you know i don't know 

380.04 381.08 A: well but i mean 

381.39 385.36 A: the fact is if it's here it's already here 

385.08 385.72 B: mhm 

386.17 387.63 B: there's nothing we can do really 

388.01 389.58 A: i mean who is to say that you know 

390.57 396.08 A: just like with the planes in the world trade center they don't go to some little post office out in booneyville 

396.19 396.65 B: mhm 

396.84 398.33 A: (( they're not )) going to have the technology 

398.43 398.89 B: mhm 

399.63 402.07 A: are they (( )) or you know whatever 

401.06 402.05 B: or somebody 

402.48 404.27 B: somebody that works there just doesn't care 

405.56 405.95 A: right 

406.46 409.02 A: and that's the problem is that 

409.66 419.70 A: i mean even like with the planes and stuff in order to get something onto a plane you have to get it through security well what if you have that one person in security that you know is involved 

418.99 419.40 B: yep 

419.97 421.41 A: and hell and people get 

421.84 424.42 A: guns and stuff like that on planes 

424.58 427.89 B: yeah and they just don't they just are too lazy to even do anything about it 

428.30 429.11 A: right 

429.19 432.84 B: so or too lazy to even look and that causes problems there too so 

433.64 439.17 A: and the fact is the only way to get rid of the problem is to get rid of the people that cause the problem 

433.67 435.49 B: another thing is employees 

439.45 445.04 B: yep and sometimes you don't even know who those people are so 

441.00 441.96 A: it sucks 

443.66 447.30 A: right and it sucks to have to say that too (( )) 

446.12 447.30 B: yeah 

448.02 450.46 A: you know unfortunately humans suck 

450.30 452.11 B: yeah exactly 

452.29 455.90 B: a lot of the problems that well all the problems we have right now are caused by 

456.20 457.58 B: not by us 

457.73 459.83 B: me and you but by everybody 

460.13 462.04 B: you know so 

460.16 460.60 A: right 

461.14 466.12 A: oh and the fact that like today they were talking about saddam hussein well hello he is part of the problem 

466.30 467.20 B: yeah yep 

467.40 470.62 A: i mean apparently he has got something that he don't want us to know he has 

470.63 471.02 B: yep 

471.60 473.53 A: and nobody knows what that is 

473.65 474.10 B: mhm 

474.23 479.87 A: or we know what it is but we don't know where it is what are we going to do go check every sand dune in the world 

476.41 477.12 B: yeah 

480.00 481.53 B: yep 

481.13 486.33 A: (( that's always )) going to happen the way i see it if he's got anything he's got it buried in a sand dune somewhere 

486.26 487.70 B: oh yeah and we're never going to find it 

487.85 488.27 A: right 

488.16 488.97 B: there's no way 

489.89 492.91 B: and everybody that's loyal to him is not going to say anything so 

493.33 498.57 A: so the fact is it's the only way to stop the problem is to get rid of the people that are the problem 

498.39 498.90 B: mhm 

499.71 500.60 B: exactly 

499.87 500.41 A: (( i me )) 

500.79 503.68 A: you talk about war but we can't afford war at the moment 

504.04 504.57 B: mhm 

504.86 511.75 A: so half the people can't find jobs who need jobs at the moment how can we afford to spend you know billions of dollars on a war 

508.20 508.58 B: yep 

511.98 515.84 B: see but they make that happen because you know they make such 

516.02 518.22 B: i mean it's not a frivolous thing but 

518.57 523.08 B: they pay for stuff that does not need to happen right now but stuff that does they put it off 

523.28 524.48 A: right 

523.90 526.29 B: and that's dumb in itself but 

527.78 529.76 B: i don't know i mean 

530.09 533.65 B: it's just like my mom said like and my friends they all said that um 

534.17 534.70 B: he's 

534.83 537.09 B: president bush is i think he is a good president 

537.91 540.58 B: but he is a little gung ho 

538.26 538.75 A: i would agree 

540.21 540.78 A: right 

540.81 547.38 B: he is a he is very quick to do stuff and i don't know i mean i guess that's good because we haven't had that in awhile but i think 

548.04 549.48 B: considering what has happened 

550.25 551.98 B: i don't think he should be as quick 

552.10 552.65 B: to 

554.17 556.23 B: do what he is doing and to do war 

556.70 563.77 A: well but you know what the fact unfortunately the fact is had he done something with saddam hussein before this wouldn't be a problem 

556.77 557.47 B: i don't know 

563.46 565.19 B: yeah exactly that's true too 

565.50 566.40 A: you know i mean 

567.18 571.94 A: as much as i hate to say that if somebody were to do something to saddam hussein um 

572.94 575.13 B: we wouldn't have as much (( )) 

573.21 574.39 A: (( )) 

574.82 575.78 A: part of the problem 

575.99 576.54 B: yep 

576.96 579.40 A: and the fact is is if you wait too long then 

580.36 580.97 A: just like 

581.85 587.11 A: with the terrorist attacks if you wait too long then they're gone and they'll never be found 

586.17 586.62 B: mhm 

587.36 587.94 A: so 

587.41 587.75 B: yep 

588.15 593.25 A: i mean sometimes speed is what you need because if you don't have it then 

590.99 596.00 B: that is true i didn't think of that so it's good to hear a different point of view 

594.93 595.36 A: right
