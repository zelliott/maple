24.53 28.04 B: yeah but i'm pretty sure that everybody would panic 

28.61 31.26 B: i mean in my book i would try to remain calm but 

30.95 34.00 A: actually can you tell me what the question was again 

32.89 39.17 B: oh oh it's about terrorism they want to know if uh if we thought that if an act of terrorism happened 

39.40 40.94 B: or uh um 

41.30 42.56 B: would people panic 

42.89 44.35 B: or would they try to remain calm 

44.42 45.08 A: oh 

45.17 46.04 B: and 

45.55 48.82 A: right so 

46.19 49.61 B: i would try to remain calm but i believe most people would panic 

50.25 51.77 A: right i mean i i guess that 

52.16 55.81 A: i guess it depends on what it is um because now 

56.83 58.43 A: mean when nine eleven came 

59.35 61.77 A: we were just totally unprepared 

61.41 62.39 B: very 

62.64 64.80 A: and if something happened now 

65.79 67.22 A: i think it would depend on what it 

67.39 68.16 A: was 

68.63 69.98 A: you know like if they 

68.76 69.05 B: what 

70.47 72.80 A: if they let's just say they 

74.77 78.76 A: um hit a train or something like that 

78.43 78.84 B: right 

78.88 79.63 A: (( you know )) um 

80.35 81.43 B: right like everybody 

80.61 85.61 A: we we would be upset but i don't think we would be quite so panicked because 

85.77 88.07 A: there are mechanisms involved 

87.88 89.43 B: y- know right well 

89.14 91.46 A: to try and deal with it but it's 

91.20 97.22 B: well if we knew exactly what was going on because i in my heart feel like they don't tell us everything 

97.51 97.88 A: right 

97.98 99.47 B: like what is going on right now 

99.80 103.40 B: with saddam hussein they don't tell us everything 

103.79 104.45 A: right 

103.90 110.30 B: i mean i was sitting there watching this man tell me that there is so much of this anthrax that over there is unaccounted for 

111.08 111.45 B: and 

111.66 113.66 B: nobody seems to be bothered by that 

114.71 115.13 B: is this 

114.77 115.13 A: well 

115.38 115.65 A: see 

115.83 116.81 B: excuse me 

116.16 117.14 A: you know i 

117.72 122.26 A: i was i mean that struck me because i was hearing it for the first time 

122.04 122.51 B: yeah 

122.41 123.05 A: um 

123.79 128.35 A: and them saying well that is serious and that's more serious so but 

127.18 127.71 B: right 

128.46 130.57 A: um on the other hand 

130.67 134.55 A: um i was just reading something today on the internet 

134.68 135.23 A: that said 

135.53 139.80 A: you know if this man really wants to stay in power which he does um 

138.96 139.50 B: mhm 

141.07 146.59 A: then the best thing to do is to get rid of it -cause if he doesn't then 

146.69 148.05 A: and we attack then 

148.42 151.29 A: he is not going to be there anymore so he is not 

150.42 150.91 B: right 

151.84 152.63 A: so dumb 

152.75 153.13 B: right 

153.97 154.78 A: um 

155.66 156.15 A: i- but 

156.41 158.38 A: so 

159.76 161.42 B: well see you were closer 

161.97 164.89 B: to all that than i am like i said i am in tennessee 

164.64 165.16 A: yeah 

165.02 167.14 B: and uh the closest thing to me that would be 

167.66 168.25 B: hit 

168.47 170.96 B: would probably be oakridge i'm sure you have heard of that 

169.86 170.31 A: right 

170.77 171.73 A: right 

171.14 173.85 B: and uh that i guess i'm about 

174.42 175.62 B: forty miles from there 

175.73 176.57 B: and 

176.16 177.36 A: where are you in tennessee 

177.21 179.40 B: uh i'm about twenty minutes from knoxville 

179.57 183.99 B: so a little bitty tiny tiny tiny town called (( )) but uh 

179.93 180.46 A: uh-huh 

181.79 182.37 A: uh-huh 

184.24 188.00 B: you know that that would that does worry me every time i see something on the t._v. 

184.47 185.04 A: if i ever 

188.07 188.75 A: oh yeah 

188.73 190.39 B: that's the first thing i think of 

190.07 190.69 A: oh yeah 

190.54 194.76 B: but then with the nine eleven i mean that was so devastating and 

194.30 196.26 A: oh it it was i think it just 

194.88 195.27 B: and 

197.00 197.76 B: it it was just 

197.27 201.62 A: the entire country i mean i know we have a cabin in minnesota in 

202.09 205.91 A: that little town there we get the newspaper and 

206.50 212.80 A: you know they're they were hurting as much as people here they 

212.34 214.70 B: oh yes yes i did everything that i was 

214.90 216.26 B: capable of to help 

216.66 217.11 A: yeah 

217.09 219.34 B: you know on line you know i'm i'm not 

219.47 228.39 B: financially able to help but in all aspects i try to write letters and console and i know that that's not real helpful but 

228.52 231.92 B: as long as somebody had somebody to listen to -em i think that might have helped some 

231.85 235.10 A: i i i think it was tremendously helpful 

232.41 233.53 B: but that is why 

233.96 244.86 B: the right well that is why i say you know i would try to remain calm and you know on the outside of course i would probably be scared to death on the inside but in order to try to keep everybody else calm 

237.90 238.32 A: yeah 

244.60 245.72 A: i mean if you think back 

245.89 246.77 A: to um 

246.95 248.45 A: oklahoma city bombing 

248.63 249.01 B: mhm 

248.68 252.95 A: i mean that was it turned out to be an internal terrorist act 

252.87 254.21 B: oh god i know 

253.12 253.42 A: and 

253.81 255.70 A: that was pretty upsetting 

255.31 255.84 B: very 

255.97 256.52 A: i mean i 

256.65 257.10 B: very 

257.20 257.82 A: um 

258.80 260.73 A: i- it i- that still 

260.83 261.43 A: you know that 

262.74 267.06 A: and and th- those kinds of things could still happen um i mean it 

266.19 267.21 B: right oh yeah 

267.24 268.35 A: i- uh 

269.31 273.38 A: and i- um they are just completely 

274.31 275.42 A: devastating 

275.20 280.17 B: right well you know things have changed so much in the past thirty years 
280.34 280.81 A: yeah 

280.74 285.57 B: that it's just ridiculous people have just they don't really care anymore 

285.35 285.76 A: yeah 

294.42 303.23 B: i don't care what strong beliefs i had i don't think i could walk in to a crowd of people with something strapped to me and blow them and me all to a million pieces 

303.34 303.75 A: right 

303.85 311.83 B: you know i don't see where their heads are in the first place if i understood better you know but i mean all i see is some idiot 

306.08 307.41 A: true no 

311.97 314.58 B: just trying to hurt a lot of people for no 

314.76 315.37 B: reason 

314.83 315.20 A: right 

315.49 318.97 A: and i know we've we've had an internal leak with you know 

318.33 320.38 B: yeah and that is even worse i mean 

320.12 320.68 A: yeah 

320.49 325.72 B: you you know you want to think better of us than that but of course we've got lots of bad people here 

325.19 325.78 A: yeah 

326.11 326.48 A: yeah 

326.49 333.99 B: i mean i see it every day i sign on a._o._l. and go to the news and hit the chats and my god we are at each other's throats anyway 

333.82 334.29 A: yeah 

334.50 334.93 A: yeah 

334.55 336.66 B: you know it's terrible so you know 

336.79 340.27 B: i just don't know i'm worried about this maybe becoming a war 

340.55 342.18 B: i worry that they are going to 

342.36 343.40 B: that you know it 

343.55 346.62 B: like colin powell is uh wanting to uh 

347.11 350.79 B: send him to another country and exile him and 

350.95 353.87 A: oh (( )) was just reading today i mean he is 

354.39 355.15 A: that would be 

355.66 357.67 A: for him to do that would be just 

358.30 359.50 B: he would lose everything 

358.59 359.91 A: acknowledging that 

359.64 360.04 B: right 

360.10 366.37 A: he'd you know he's he's he moves around so much to keep himself safe to give himself up like this would 

360.62 361.65 B: that he's done 

366.88 367.21 A: could 

367.00 367.50 B: mhm 

367.63 374.01 A: could be a real threat to his personal safety even within the country 

368.78 369.91 B: well and then i 

372.08 373.14 B: exactly 

373.60 375.45 B: exactly because i mean 

376.04 376.79 B: he 

377.30 379.28 B: if i seen him on the street i'd know him 

379.38 379.84 A: yeah 

379.75 380.57 B: regardless 

380.56 381.07 A: right 

380.89 383.94 B: you know he's been thrown in my face so much i would know who he was 

384.05 384.56 A: yeah 

384.86 388.93 B: you know open your mouth i do know who you are but 

389.86 391.80 B: no i just don't know what is going to happen next 

391.30 392.08 A: i mean other 

392.17 397.00 A: uh w- other dictators have gone in to exile but i just don't see him doing that 

397.04 397.75 B: no 

397.27 398.50 A: but maybe it's 

398.05 400.03 B: no because he would lose everything 

400.32 400.95 A: well he 

401.48 402.77 A: he has more 

403.75 405.19 A: power in the country 

405.15 406.03 B: exactly 

405.34 406.62 A: as a mortar 

406.43 407.22 B: exactly 

407.83 408.40 A: and 

408.54 409.57 A: in exile 

409.65 410.16 B: mhm 

410.55 415.02 B: and i i mean it's it's an out for him but i don't think he wants an out 

414.96 415.49 A: no 

415.50 417.18 B: i think he wants to test us 

417.40 417.78 A: yeah 

417.90 418.37 B: and 

418.49 421.00 B: h- he wants to blow up his little oil fields 

421.87 423.92 B: and you know because he said he would 

423.92 424.36 A: yeah 

424.37 430.57 B: and that would be what he meant what he said was it would break america's neck and that is what it would do 

428.91 429.33 A: yeah 

430.66 431.02 A: yeah 

431.07 438.94 B: it is true so you know if they would come out and tell the people of the united states exactly what was going on 

432.14 432.74 A: yeah 

439.50 441.51 B: you know maybe we could put in more input 

442.00 444.34 B: that there's so many things that they won't tell us 

444.48 444.97 A: yeah 

444.59 446.42 B: and don't want us to know 

446.26 450.15 A: and north korea is is probably i mean i read 

450.41 454.31 B: yes they are very strong and that's even more scary 

451.22 452.71 A: probably more if that 

454.49 461.78 A: i mean i i just don't know why they are doing this with iraq because we haven't build up afghanistan 

462.68 463.77 A: i mean this doesn't relate 

464.12 464.95 A: terrorisms 

464.31 465.94 B: well if it doesn't concern us 

466.43 466.93 A: yeah 

466.43 468.19 B: and we are not in any trouble 

468.41 471.08 B: then let them do it amongst themselves if they are able 

471.61 472.03 B: you know 

472.09 473.01 A: except that we 

472.22 474.77 B: i mean i don't know how the armies are over there 

474.57 475.09 A: yeah 

475.36 477.03 B: you know but i mean 

477.28 478.20 A: but if we did 

478.49 478.93 A: i mean if 

479.10 483.22 A: if we did go in to iraq and then had to rebuild a second country when we are not 

483.96 485.44 A: be building the first one 

485.58 488.21 B: right well we are in a bad enough shape ourselves 

488.03 489.56 A: i know 

488.57 494.35 B: you know it so i don't understand it they are too that's what i am saying you know they don't tell us enough 

494.88 497.79 B: for anybody to make a really good opinion on it 

498.12 498.68 A: and w- 

498.96 503.20 A: well and based on what we know what is frightening is 

504.59 505.21 A: if we 

505.76 508.68 A: do say something we can't be sure that it makes a 

508.96 510.06 A: a lot of difference 

509.98 518.90 B: u- um that is true too but i mean gosh i can't tell you how many letters i've written to senators and congressmen and stuff about all kinds of different things 

518.71 519.42 A: yeah 

519.22 524.72 B: and the most you get back is a little piece of paper saying thank you for writing your congressman and stamped you know 

523.41 525.87 A: oh well yeah i think that is important though 

526.01 529.66 B: it it well i do um i'm a big animal activist
