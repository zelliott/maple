0.12 2.35 A: hi my name is samantha 

2.35 3.74 B: (( hi my name is )) 

3.78 5.69 B: uh living in texas 

5.42 7.14 A: hi i'm in virginia 

6.83 7.68 B: uh-huh 

8.59 12.77 A: um you can start or i can start it doesn't really matter 

9.16 10.71 B: so uh 

12.81 25.00 B: [mn] so i think in terms of the uh about terrorism i think the government the u._s. government may may need to do something like the resignation or 

25.63 27.60 B: (( or something like that yeah )) 

28.57 31.65 B: (( i mean it's people more alert with )) 

32.00 33.38 B: those uh 

33.94 36.18 B: yeah those kind of things yeah 

36.00 39.45 A: right can they be more aware of what can happen 

39.11 41.38 B: uh-huh yeah 

41.04 50.78 A: see we live in a very rural area where no one is aware of actually what could happen and they believe nothing can be done 

50.54 51.32 B: (( [sigh] uh-huh uh-huh )) 

51.69 53.72 A: where it really could be 

53.97 56.15 A: where if people were more prepared 

58.07 61.52 B: yeah we are living in a town and so 

61.77 63.00 B: um 

64.21 68.39 B: we look at the t._v. and then yeah we always 

68.59 72.47 B: yeah aware of those uh you know from the t._v. 

73.76 77.45 A: right but not all times you can believe everything you see 

77.83 81.24 B: yeah [laughter] uh-huh uh-uh yeah 

78.69 79.94 A: [laughter] 

80.61 84.04 A: some things you have to use your own judgment 

84.37 85.68 B: (( uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh-huh )) 

87.27 91.84 A: but we are living in an a time where people should worry 

93.29 95.55 A: but i really don't think they do 

96.47 100.41 B: yeah in fact there is the larger of um those 

100.59 103.71 B: (( uh worries )) 

103.80 105.08 B: or something 

105.11 106.00 B: (( i )) 

106.39 113.07 B: mean most of the people may not know about only those scientists um 

113.10 115.19 B: (( or those work with the uh uh )) 

115.35 116.51 B: (( labs )) 

116.54 120.05 B: know about all those stuff and yeah 

120.30 124.62 A: oh i agree completely and they kinda keep us in the dark 

124.86 126.35 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

127.29 133.24 A: but if we were made more aware we could prepare ourselves mentally and physically 

133.76 134.67 B: (( uh-huh )) 

136.32 141.86 B: yeah maybe the maybe the government need to spend more money on those 

142.08 143.83 B: (( uh um to )) 

144.46 146.53 B: (( tell you something )) 

146.60 148.77 B: and yeah 

148.17 150.50 A: and more homeland security 

150.11 151.43 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh yeah [sigh] uh-huh )) 

151.79 159.39 A: because right now so many soldiers have been shipped away we don't really have that much homeland security 

159.67 161.52 A: which i think we need 

161.52 163.66 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

164.69 168.33 A: but after nine eleven people need to be made more aware 

169.76 178.14 B: yeah yeah we should be more aware of the homeland as well as the other countries uh-huh yeah mhm 

177.83 179.67 A: right internationally 

185.41 188.10 A: so this is such a broad topic 

187.75 191.87 B: yeah [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

188.29 190.10 A: [laughter] 

192.98 197.57 B: and most of people most of the people do not know too much about 

197.60 198.55 B: (( uh )) 

198.66 202.13 B: (( unless they they are family with those uh )) 

202.17 203.13 B: (( you know uh-huh mhm )) 

202.35 204.01 A: (( [mn] right )) 

204.06 209.80 A: we have that also and then you have the family that believes one thing and does another 

210.27 214.95 A: to prepare themselves in case something would happen 

215.43 219.58 A: where they're really overly aware of what could go on 

220.51 222.33 A: but i think right now 

222.46 230.39 A: the biggest thing the government couldn't do anything to stop something that's gonna happen because if it's gonna happen it'll happen anyway 

231.96 233.26 B: (( mhm mhm yeah mhm mhm )) 

234.21 238.31 A: so by trying to stop something that's pretty much inevitable 

241.64 246.01 A: that's just wasting time and money that could be put to something else 

251.13 255.37 A: but i'm sure not many people [laughter] would agree with me on that 

259.54 265.66 A: i think by living in a small town your opinions are kinda different as if you were living in a larger city 

265.94 273.54 A: where we live somewhere we feel moderately safe against things like that someone in a bigger city would not 

275.71 277.66 B: (( mhm mhm yeah )) 

278.47 283.24 B: (( yeah i think if you live in some rural areas is )) 

283.60 287.23 B: maybe a little bit more safer than the 

287.54 289.28 A: right than if you were in 

287.73 290.07 B: large cities because most of the 

290.22 292.03 B: those terrorists 

292.42 299.22 B: i think they mostly aim at those large cities and with 

298.50 301.32 A: like new york which so far 

299.86 300.74 B: (( a )) 

301.63 303.37 B: (( lot of people )) 

304.80 309.95 A: we have the disadvantage of living closer to washington d._c. but 

310.14 317.01 A: we're far enough away where we still can feel safe against any kind of bio terrorism or any kind of terrorism 

319.76 324.14 A: but it's still something that crosses your mind on occasions 

322.66 324.01 B: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

325.06 327.49 B: no because on one knows uh 

327.52 331.02 B: where it will happen you know and mhm 

334.01 341.87 A: but really there's no stopping it and they can't do anything to stop it but just prepare people in case it was to happen 

346.70 349.98 B: no i think that's that's almost 

350.47 353.08 B: and that's my opinion 

353.60 360.69 A: mine too it's just going it's something that if it's going to happen it's we just have to accept that [mn] 

364.05 365.36 B: (( uh-huh okay )) 

376.84 378.94 B: (( [mn] so that's it )) 

379.13 384.23 A: um i think we have to wait for another tone or something on the telephone 

383.87 384.96 B: oh really 

385.09 391.66 A: and an operator comes on or something i'm not really sure this is the first time i've ever done one of these 

392.26 399.35 B: no this is my second time and i think if we've finished then we can hang up or 

399.61 401.54 A: is that what you did before 

401.94 405.40 B: yeah and that's what i did last time but i'm not sure 

405.61 409.51 B: are you sure that we have to wait for the tone or 

410.42 412.57 A: i honestly do not know 

414.11 420.98 B: because the last time when we finished we just hang up and did not wait for any tone 

421.63 427.95 A: well that works for me [laughter] as long as i get the money [laughter] 

424.99 428.83 B: [laughter] uh-huh 

428.73 431.71 A: because that would be an important part of doing this 

431.69 432.60 B: (( uh-huh )) 

432.81 435.32 A: but as far as i'm concerned 

434.72 440.82 B: yeah it's one the most important parts and uh also quite interesting 

439.46 442.95 A: yes it is you get a chance to know everybody's opinion 

442.78 445.97 B: yeah yes and it's also nice to talk to you uh-huh 

446.00 447.61 A: yes you too 

448.20 450.35 A: you have a nice accent 

451.26 452.97 B: i got an accent 

452.39 453.73 A: (( yeah [laughter] [mn] )) 

453.13 454.02 B: (( uh-huh )) 

457.09 460.16 A: yes not one that we hear very often here 

460.64 461.49 B: (( uh-huh )) 

462.20 465.74 A: we get to hear the southern accent but not 

466.03 467.82 A: not really anything else 

468.94 472.83 B: so did you hear most of what i said or oh okay 

472.08 473.16 A: yes 

474.99 477.33 A: yes i understood you just fine 

478.12 481.13 A: but as far as i'm concerned i'm done 

481.16 482.44 B: uh-huh i'm done too 

482.48 484.56 A: and you have a great day 

484.22 487.38 B: you too thanks bye-bye 

484.87 485.95 A: bye-bye 

489.80 490.71 B: (( [noise] ))
