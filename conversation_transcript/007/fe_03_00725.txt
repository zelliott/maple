9.90 10.79 A: terrorism 

10.94 13.09 A: how would would how we would react 

13.23 14.48 A: if we were attacked 

14.51 18.94 B: oh okay so it is like taking it for in the future 

14.84 15.11 A: (( )) 

15.26 15.90 A: do 

17.82 18.40 A: yeah 

18.71 19.76 A: would we panic 

20.36 29.25 B: um i don't think i would based on nine one one i didn't really get uh uh a feeling of being panicked or anything 

29.75 30.58 B: what about you 

30.58 36.00 A: i did then but um but since then i'm not sure i would it think it's come to a (( p- )) 

36.78 38.70 A: in my life i guess where 

39.80 41.78 A: expect anything you know 

42.06 42.77 B: right 

43.14 44.90 B: yeah i guess our innocence is gone 

44.90 46.12 A: yeah exactly 

45.55 51.68 B: uh 

51.85 61.53 B: invincible and then now that we know that that is not true then yeah you are right it is like well we know wh- what to expect so you are not a- as afraid 

52.80 53.43 A: right 

61.22 61.71 A: right 

62.03 65.37 B: well for me i i live where i am around a lot of my family 

65.48 66.12 A: uh-huh 

65.92 68.43 B: so i think that makes a big difference too 

67.56 68.97 A: oh yeah i do too 

69.05 73.71 B: you know for like the ones who aren't i'm sure there is a lot more fear because it is like 

69.54 69.94 A: yeah 

73.86 75.31 B: you are more alone than ever 

75.33 75.77 A: right 

76.37 79.08 A: plus the fact that if you had family 

79.38 79.80 A: like 

80.29 81.42 A: in new york 

81.67 83.92 A: during nine one one i think that 

84.06 85.09 A: you know uh uh 

85.40 86.72 A: situation like that 

87.06 88.81 A: would upset somebody worse 

88.87 90.26 B: right exactly 

90.58 95.43 B: well you know if you don't live there and it happened to them you feel hope you feel helpless 

95.62 96.11 A: right 

96.14 99.45 B: defenseless you can't do anything to what has happened to them 

99.24 99.83 A: right 

99.62 105.30 B: and it would be the same thing here you'd feel defenseless if something happened to us you know and and right where we live 

105.32 105.75 A: right 

106.36 108.86 B: so yeah i can see how that was it was uh 

109.08 111.54 B: for me nine one one was kind of 

112.55 114.66 B: it wasn't as big as a um 

115.90 124.03 B: oh i don't know how to say this without sounding bad you know it didn't it wasn't as big of an impact on me as i saw in the news and everything because i had just started a new job 

122.11 122.50 A: yeah 

124.00 124.59 A: uh-huh 

124.39 127.71 B: it was on my second day of the i was on the second day of my new job 

127.39 128.66 A: oh god 

128.68 131.35 B: so i was like that was all that i was thinking about was my new job 

131.37 131.78 A: yeah 

131.74 135.79 B: you know and so i'd hear a little bits of reports and stuff so i wasn't even thinking about that 

132.25 132.69 A: yeah 

135.71 136.15 A: right 

136.27 138.53 B: so really it didn't hit me until after 

138.61 141.57 A: well we heard it on the radio all day at work and it just 

142.60 146.32 A: uh i kept thinking it is so far away but yet it is so 

147.29 149.48 A: what can i say devastating i guess 

149.00 149.51 B: right 

149.76 150.18 B: right 

150.28 155.49 A: and i did watch a lot of it and finally my mother who lives out on the east coast said 

155.90 157.39 A: stop watching that 

158.06 162.77 A: and i thought she is right why am i watching this every single day day after day 

158.10 158.51 B: right 

163.00 163.40 B: right 

163.61 165.41 A: -cause that is what upset me worse 

165.93 166.97 A: than the initial 

166.97 167.67 B: exactly 

167.18 167.69 A: attack 

167.79 171.27 B: and i agree with that because i've seen that happened that happens like with 

171.38 174.34 B: uh so many of the situations that come up 

174.53 178.44 B: it is like well after you've heard the news about it and you've heard the report 

179.03 183.81 B: instead of just listening to it over and over and over and over without learning anything new there is 

183.63 184.11 A: right 

183.99 185.84 B: you know the that makes it worse 

185.84 186.24 A: right 

186.34 189.02 B: -cause then you just dwell on it it was like i- it 

186.53 186.87 A: right 

189.45 192.55 B: in essence it to me it was like the uh o._j. trial 

192.69 193.19 A: uh-huh 

193.11 201.46 B: everybody watched it you know and there really wasn't a lot of big impact days you know that they were watching it i wasn't though i i just 

193.36 193.76 A: yes 

198.03 198.44 A: right 

199.58 200.02 A: right 

201.97 203.67 B: to me i just can not do it -cause you just 

203.79 206.13 B: it will like consume your mind if you start 

206.27 208.29 B: you know if you focus on it too much 

207.50 214.11 A: yeah i think that is what i was doing and i think that is why my mother kind of got on me about it she is ninety years old and she 

214.36 215.68 A: never even turned it on 

215.83 216.67 B: oh really 

216.07 218.03 A: she didn't want to know anything about it 

219.12 219.81 A: other than 

224.44 230.55 B: i got home i said you know i think i need to put to see what is going on so i did watch and and look for all of the reports i normally don't 

230.65 231.65 B: see a lot of news 

231.70 232.09 A: yeah 

232.17 235.00 B: but i did look for it to see it but then once i saw that 

241.08 245.74 B: that is the way it would be if we were threatened i i live on the gulf coast and we've always been 

246.52 248.14 B: told or i've heard that this 

248.79 249.17 B: prime 

249.31 249.93 B: spot 

249.82 250.27 A: uh-huh 

250.50 253.87 B: you know a lot of the oil companies are around here and stuff 

253.32 253.96 A: oh yeah 

254.53 260.82 B: so that's always been a uh a threat that i've lived with or you know just a possible threat that i've lived with 

255.11 255.62 A: thought that 

260.69 261.07 A: yeah 

261.30 261.86 B: but 

262.45 264.16 B: uh uh you know i don't 

264.53 266.97 B: the threat of terrorism doesn't 

267.24 269.77 B: (( )) it doesn't make me 

270.16 275.23 B: uh you know go underground or whatever i just live my life 

273.02 273.57 A: right 

274.86 276.30 A: exactly i don't 

275.84 279.71 B: and then when and if something does happen then we'll just recover from it 

279.46 281.71 A: right you have to just take it as it comes 

282.13 284.24 B: right well it is like when a hurricane hits here 

284.10 284.54 A: right 

284.77 292.74 B: you know yeah you do some preparation you do some planning that is fine but you just wait and see if it happens then you just recover and if it doesn't then you just keep going on 

292.82 295.48 A: what are you going to do stand out in the middle of the yard and stop it 
295.61 296.33 B: exactly 

295.81 296.29 A: you know 

296.49 297.18 B: yeah no 

296.50 297.70 A: that is how i look at it 

298.10 299.57 B: right exactly 

299.41 301.33 A: now we have a an arsenal right 

301.55 306.53 A: oh about five miles from me as a matter of fact i can hear them testing over there 

303.44 303.98 B: oh my 

305.94 306.55 B: ach 

306.72 307.72 B: oh my goodness 

307.27 310.85 A: and i think and i've heard that that was the third highest 

312.01 313.09 A: you know the level 

312.69 313.40 B: target 

313.56 315.08 A: yeah uh and 

315.66 318.50 A: everybody says to me doesn't it bother you to live there and i think 

319.06 320.10 A: what is the difference 

320.52 324.14 A: if i didn't live here i would live somewhere else and there would be something else 

324.20 325.56 B: yeah oh but 

325.08 325.62 A: so i just 

325.73 328.90 B: still just to hear that you can hear all of the uh 

325.85 326.98 A: we just live with it 

329.27 331.00 B: the the bombing and stuff 

330.91 331.32 A: yeah 

331.47 331.85 A: yeah 

331.86 333.12 B: when they are practicing 

332.92 333.32 A: yeah 

333.34 338.35 B: oh no i i guess like like me you've just gotten used to it but that sounds like it would be awful 

338.75 341.68 A: it really after awhile you don't even hear it 

342.50 349.86 A: unless you happen to have the windows open or you are out in the yard or something it is like living next to uh i'd say railroad tracks 

346.04 346.52 B: right 

349.50 352.47 B: right and that is what we do and i know exactly what you mean 

351.08 351.52 A: yeah 

353.04 358.76 B: -cause you are right un- until it is late at night and i'm laying there and finally i'll hear one but i know they go by all the time 

353.13 355.04 A: sooner or later you tune it out 

358.78 359.37 A: oh yeah 

359.55 359.84 A: yeah 

360.04 360.52 B: yeah 

360.09 361.26 A: that is the way with this 

361.39 362.47 A: it is every day but 

362.88 364.59 A: we don't even hear it half the time 

364.82 365.89 B: exactly 

366.47 370.68 B: well then that is just what it is you know with the with the terrorism that is why 

371.32 372.29 B: you know it kind of 

373.01 376.34 B: having bush going so so hard into getting into war 

377.25 379.54 B: i- it kind of makes me think about it more 

379.53 380.60 A: yeah yeah 

379.99 383.44 B: you know -cause i'm thinking if we do something there may be some retaliation 

383.52 385.23 A: yeah that is what i think too 

385.42 391.96 B: you know but not that i think that he is making any wrong decisions i think he is doing what we need to do for this country 

385.81 386.14 A: (( that )) 

392.22 396.00 A: i guess i have mixed emotions about it because i have a son in the service 

395.86 397.52 B: oh oh yes most 

396.58 399.32 A: and so i think twice about it you know but 

399.50 400.85 B: now is he active or 

400.99 401.44 A: yeah 

401.52 402.98 B: wh- what branch of the service 

402.28 402.72 A: oh yeah 

402.92 403.38 A: navy 

403.87 406.93 B: oh wow has he been called up or anything okay 

405.88 406.76 A: no no 

406.86 407.22 A: uh-uh 

407.72 412.09 B: that is good i know they just sent some from uh down here on the coast i heard 

408.23 408.82 A: well the 

411.53 412.12 A: oh did they 

412.23 419.82 B: yeah i heard about it i don't know anybody personally that is in the service so you know i i don't have a specific 

415.13 415.53 A: yeah 

419.93 428.52 B: knowledge of who all is going but i heard that some were coming up over here from the coast yeah well i just don't want 

422.03 422.41 A: yeah 

425.00 425.34 A: huh 

429.06 432.71 B: i don't want terrorists to think that we are just going to sit down and be a 

432.44 433.01 A: really 

433.06 437.05 B: a you know a mat for them to walk on and that we are just going to sit there and take it 

434.91 438.27 A: yup i know exactly what you are saying exactly 

438.14 444.37 B: i mean because that is a major step that that the president is taking you know and he knows he is taking 

444.66 448.30 B: uh uh a stand that is not favorable to everybody 

448.12 448.58 A: mhm 

448.94 453.21 B: and you know and he's been a a good favored president and so you know that is a hard decision 

453.34 453.85 A: right 

453.84 456.71 B: but i think it sends a message to the terrorists that 

457.18 457.71 B: you know 

458.04 460.99 A: well like you said you can't sit back and not 

458.17 459.01 B: wh- what 

461.76 465.62 A: you know and just let them walk all over you -cause then if you did they are going to 

466.00 472.06 B: right exactly and they've proven that already -cause we you know by them hitting the twin towers that was 

472.16 473.59 B: not the first time 

473.54 474.39 A: no it wasn't 

474.51 479.86 B: you know it is the first time we actually realized that that was what was going on 

478.07 478.41 A: yeah 

479.88 480.15 A: yup 

480.57 480.85 A: yup 

480.80 484.47 B: you know we fooled ourselves previously -cause they they were the ones that hit the uh 

484.97 487.70 B: the twin tower the garage the parking under 

487.41 488.25 A: right 

487.91 489.30 B: underground parking 

489.19 489.55 A: yup 

489.87 491.89 B: and we just didn't you know 

492.06 496.32 A: didn't think i think we looked at it as it's one single incident and it 

492.76 494.27 B: nah no 

495.88 496.68 B: right 

496.43 497.68 A: won't happen again 

497.33 498.12 B: right 

498.47 498.75 A: but 

499.03 499.62 B: so 

500.00 501.07 A: sorry that it happened 

500.06 504.68 B: so it it's like they they already it didn't take any provocation for them to do that 

504.40 505.05 A: oh no 

505.16 506.30 A: no not at all 

505.28 510.05 B: so us by sitting just sitting on the sidelines wouldn't have accomplished anything 

510.10 510.49 A: right 

511.05 511.34 A: right 

512.14 513.50 A: no i i just 

514.28 517.02 A: i guess i'm like you you just sit back and wait and 

517.92 518.84 A: do whatever 

518.86 519.35 B: yeah 

519.28 519.78 A: you know 

519.91 524.70 B: i think though one one positive thing about it uh you know if you can say there is something 

525.00 528.34 B: is that i think the people are are reevaluating their faith
