0.60 2.36 A: hello i'm sandra 

2.05 4.15 B: hi my name is karen 

5.35 7.92 B: it's an interesting question isn't it [laughter] 

7.35 11.05 A: yes it is [laughter] a very touchy one [laughter] 

10.17 11.94 B: (( [laughter] )) 

11.47 14.80 A: it didn't really say how close of a friend 

14.10 19.06 B: yes yeah and for what kind of ah to me it also matters um 

19.08 19.99 B: wh- 

20.84 34.30 B: what kind of offence it is or you know well i guess i guess my quick answer would be no i wouldn't do it but i think there probably isn't a situation i would do it under but i can't rule it out [laughter] i guess 

32.81 37.26 A: [laughter] well i think i'd be the same way unless it was one of my children 

37.37 39.97 A: i wouldn't have any problem saying no 

37.84 38.96 B: yeah 

40.91 45.21 B: yeah if ah yeah i have a son who's twenty years old and 

40.93 41.66 A: (( but )) 

45.48 53.09 B: um i would hope he would never get in trouble but i guess one i guess one way one situation i could think of that maybe i would would be 

53.15 54.27 B: if he 

54.65 64.10 B: made a mistake or or did something that was against the law and that i knew he would never do it again that it was a real fluke or 

64.12 70.94 B: i don't know sometimes people get in trouble with the law when it's not even anything they did but they're in the wrong place at the wrong time you know say ah 

70.90 73.46 A: oh i've known plenty of that to happen yeah 

72.69 76.31 B: yeah fr- you know especially kids my son's age ah 

76.33 80.89 B: maybe at a party or something goes on and they don't have anything to do with it but 

77.70 78.55 A: yeah 

80.98 84.06 B: but everybody gets arrested that kind of thing you know 

83.19 86.94 A: yeah well my son's twenty three so i know exactly where you're coming from 

86.67 91.30 B: yeah do you know how long these calls are supposed to last [laughter] 

90.66 93.19 A: um ten minutes aren't they 

92.94 95.80 B: oh i can't remember this is the first one i've gotten 

95.59 96.95 A: yeah me too 

96.87 97.92 B: um 

100.52 101.45 B: (( let's see )) 

101.84 104.34 A: another thing we have to stay on the subject 

103.93 105.19 B: yeah 

104.57 106.44 A: but it's the first one i've gotten 

106.01 107.58 B: yeah um 

110.03 110.82 A: hm 

111.05 113.18 A: they should have given us a little more information 

112.68 114.40 B: [laughter] 

114.19 118.76 A: they could have at least told us what the charge was what was the perjury pertaining to 

116.15 117.23 B: yeah 

118.22 120.74 B: yeah the question was just would you 

121.47 127.46 B: would you possibly commit perjury for a close friend i think that's how they put it right 

126.75 132.54 A: i really don't see any circumstances i would do it for just a friend and it would have to be really something 

130.13 131.17 B: right 

132.55 134.93 A: light for me to do it for my son 

135.13 136.22 B: right 

135.93 138.17 A: i wouldn't do it if it was anything serious 

138.78 140.63 B: right um 

140.66 147.20 B: i- i guess if we're sticking to the question i don't think i don't guess i would do it for for a friend either 

147.33 149.99 A: i can't think of any situation i would 

147.50 148.57 B: um 

150.83 151.90 B: um 

152.25 157.62 B: no i can't think of any examples right off but i i know there are sometimes laws that 

157.85 162.08 B: probably ought to be changed or that i think ought to be changed and 

160.87 161.81 A: yeah 

162.17 170.72 B: but i mean if it's if it's something that's just i mean there are some things that there's just no question about you know things that are wrong stealing ah 

169.48 170.85 A: yeah 

171.13 175.27 B: you know murder assault and that you know that sort of thing but 

175.53 176.59 B: um 

177.11 188.60 B: i don't know i guess guess maybe if it was some minor minor drug using type offence even though i don't i don't take 'em myself and i don't think i don't think they're a good idea i also think the 

188.73 190.80 B: prisons are too stuffed with ah 

191.12 192.21 B: with um 

193.01 195.59 B: drug offenders [laughter] you know 

194.68 198.11 A: yeah i think they need to find a new way to deal with that situation too 

197.23 199.44 B: yeah yeah i do too 

199.58 204.57 B: so i guess that's maybe that's one thing like ah that maybe i would if um 

204.56 206.09 A: yeah 

205.18 209.25 B: if to say if ah if i were called to testify and they asked 

209.51 210.46 B: (( ah )) 

211.33 223.68 B: have you ever known your close friend to smoke marijuana i don't know that they'd ask a question like that but i if i thought it would ge- keep them from prison i would probably say no i've never known them to smoke marijuana 

222.70 223.63 A: yeah 

224.57 226.64 A: i think you're right there that would be 

226.87 229.84 A: almost nothing i mean it wouldn't be anything serious 

228.02 234.08 B: [laughter] i mean that probably wouldn't happen i don't know i don't even have any friends that smoke it so [laughter] oh 

232.36 233.95 A: [laughter] no neither 

234.15 235.05 B: um 

235.58 240.46 A: and i got lucky my son didn't ever use it so i really don't know much about that kind of stuff 

239.82 241.04 B: yeah 

241.96 242.87 B: (( um )) 

242.23 244.48 A: i wonder if they'll let us know when the time's up 

244.37 250.65 B: i betcha they will since it's automated i'm sure there'll be some ki- i betcha it'll say when there's ah thirty seconds left or something 

246.63 247.36 A: (( i )) 

249.84 252.31 A: was beginning to think i wasn't going to get a call 

251.89 254.71 B: [laughter] um 

255.69 259.57 B: what else can we say about this i want to make sure we do it right [laughter] so we would you 

258.88 260.58 A: i don't know um 

259.76 260.86 B: (( commit perjury )) 

262.50 270.89 A: they didn't say you know how long we had known the friend if it's a close friend it would are they close just recently or have we known them all of our lives or 

269.13 270.43 B: mhm 

270.92 275.87 B: well it's probably good that we bring things like that up because when they listen to this maybe they will they'll ah 

276.36 282.90 B: ah maybe they'll learn ways that they ought to ah change the question make it more specific so that's probably good to talk about 

280.78 283.58 A: yeah make it a little more detail would be nice 

283.07 293.18 B: yeah because that's a good point you could feel like someone's a close friend but you've only known them for a month that's then you don't really know 'em like you would somebody you've known 

292.92 293.89 A: yeah 

293.44 295.75 B: since you were in school together or something 

294.50 297.53 A: that would make a lot of difference in the situation too 

297.06 299.22 B: mhm mhm 

298.26 306.82 A: if it was somebody i grew up with as a child i'd be probably more pertaining to do something like that than i would be for someone i only know a few years 

301.07 302.20 B: mhm 

306.22 312.62 B: right right because you know what the old you really know what the old friend is like like their character 

310.94 312.04 A: yeah 

314.38 318.58 B: and um i've never had to testify for in anything before 

318.52 322.30 A: oh thank goodness me neither [laughter] i don't believe i could handle it 

319.55 321.27 B: (( [laughter] )) 

323.23 324.21 B: (( oh )) 

323.53 327.21 A: but i just don't know what else to say about it really 

326.63 328.06 B: (( i don't either [laughter] )) 

329.41 330.14 B: (( hm )) 

330.25 332.04 A: they caught me off guard 

331.43 333.41 B: yeah it's 

334.94 336.33 B: so if um 

336.38 344.56 B: this is of course it's very hypothetical if if your child if your son if you had a pretty good idea say that he killed someone 

345.04 348.52 A: oh now that would be serious no that would be no way mm 

345.25 349.14 B: there's no way you would cover for yeah same here 

350.54 355.45 A: um well i'm a real stickler for him doing what's right i just don't want to see anybody doing him wrong 

355.41 357.96 B: now here's okay here's another 

358.60 360.55 B: (( ah n- now say )) 

360.79 364.55 B: say you have to um testify in the case of um 

364.59 368.75 B: well let's keep it to a friend since that's what they ask and it's 

367.05 367.90 A: okay 

368.93 372.15 B: maybe what the trial is about is ah 

373.25 374.23 B: um 

374.57 381.31 B: is something very serious but you know that they didn't do it but there's ah some kind of circumstantial 

381.56 387.28 B: they they maybe have c- circumstantial evidence kind of case against your friend and 

385.73 386.88 A: mhm 

387.66 390.28 B: maybe by sa- by answering 

390.29 391.91 B: a question or 

392.04 396.47 B: you know by committing perjury on on on a question that they ask you 

396.87 397.96 B: (( ah )) 

398.98 400.37 B: that could ah 

401.18 414.61 B: okay so remember the person is innocent you know they're innocent but people do get railroaded and um say if you could if you could answer a question that doesn't that's not really about anything very important 

404.30 405.09 A: mhm 

414.70 421.92 B: you know there's some small thing that just happens to be part of the circumstantial evidence against the person i think i would do that 

418.80 419.83 A: yeah 

420.10 423.68 A: it would be a tough call yeah that would be a tough call there 

422.95 427.16 B: i- i think i might do that i'd rather not but 

424.84 425.99 A: yeah 

426.35 430.93 A: but i would have to know without a doubt that they did not do it 

430.28 431.84 B: yes me too 

431.33 435.69 A: not just a good belief while i don't believe they're capable of that because 

435.14 436.20 B: mhm 

435.76 437.94 A: i have had that happen before 

439.23 444.22 A: a good friend of ours here that was actually my teacher in high school murdered his wife 

444.48 445.80 B: oh wow 

444.50 448.77 A: and none of us would believe he was capable of it because he was the best teacher we had 

448.28 449.50 B: yeah 

448.92 453.05 A: but none of us got to go testify i don't know why they didn't call any of us in 

454.04 461.10 B: mhm yeah that's a good point too just because you think somebody's not capable of it doesn't mean that they're not because you can't know everything 

454.52 455.55 A: yeah 

459.50 464.18 A: yeah you'd have to really really know for sure that what you're doing was right 

462.00 462.98 B: yeah 

465.56 468.87 A: because we never would have believed he would have done that 

468.44 469.52 B: yeah 

470.67 472.44 B: (( yeah it must have been a shock )) 

472.33 485.37 A: he'd always acted like he was so crazy about his wife and we just we could not believe it because he went to the extent of riding a bicycle twenty five miles to keep himself from getting caught he almost got away with 

486.10 489.60 B: gosh makes you wonder wh- wh- what happened that made him ah 

490.21 493.26 B: whether something suddenly happened that made him ah 

493.85 495.49 B: decide to do that or 

493.98 494.65 A: it 

494.79 500.21 A: i don't guess they really ever did say you know the suspicion was that he had another woman somewhere 

500.34 501.20 B: (( mm )) 

500.84 505.15 A: but i don't know if that ended up being it or not because he never did marry anybody else 

507.10 509.97 A: after he got out he was even alone so i don't know 

511.83 517.34 A: but yeah that would make me think twice about somebody that i thought would never do something like that 

518.21 520.03 B: i- i guess one 

520.20 524.45 B: i couldn't rule it out completely because one reason is because ah 

526.01 528.13 B: i do i do know 

528.32 529.17 B: (( ah )) 

529.55 541.30 B: of a lot of cases where people have even been on death row and have turned out to be innocent and i met one fellow personally named randall adams that is a pretty big 

534.58 537.48 A: yeah i've heard one case 

541.79 542.53 B: (( ah )) 

542.64 546.44 B: pretty big case in the dallas texas area an 

546.74 551.13 B: ah was on death row was about to get executed and um 

549.69 550.87 A: oh my goodness 

551.44 554.36 B: someone else did it and i mean [mn] 

553.47 563.71 A: i've been thinking about that mother they were telling on t._v. the other night that they had her in prison for murdering her child they come to find out her child had some rare disease that causes bruises on 'em 

564.51 565.83 A: did you see that one 

565.35 568.81 B: no i haven't i've heard of that happening though there's some kind of 

567.66 570.92 A: that's another one that went to prison for something she didn't do 

570.59 572.14 B: (( oh my goodness )) 

574.12 577.95 B: yeah like if you like i said if if i if i ah 

579.57 583.68 B: say that would be a good example say say your good friend you know that the 

583.55 594.92 B: child has the disease that could make it look like they've been abused and they and they haven't you know ah and there's another disease brittle bone disease i think it's called and those kids will break bones just 

587.66 588.94 A: mhm 

594.94 599.90 B: by just taking a little tumble like all kids do and a lot of times their parents get accused 

597.76 598.84 A: mhm
