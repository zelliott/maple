59.75 61.92 A: the only thing i can see is is uh 

62.04 66.00 A: (( )) get the prints and uh watching what the heck is going on out there you know we 

66.98 67.24 A: (( )) 

67.48 71.46 A: then possibly uh putting some uh pre-positioning some stuff uh you know 

72.66 79.64 A: extra beds quarantine gear all that kind of stuff because the only way we're going to stop it if someone hits us is lock everybody down for a week or two 

80.66 81.19 B: well 

81.37 85.43 B: mm no what about (( )) 

86.06 89.80 B: what about the stand for example that would will certainly be possible 

90.02 91.45 B: within the next fifty years 

91.85 93.78 B: it (( )) it could probably do it right now 

91.91 100.95 A: well true but the point is you have to be you have to connect to communicate eh uh if you for example put everybo- say everybody (( )) stay in your house you can't uh don't go out unless you absolutely need to 

101.41 102.92 A: blah blah blah blah for a week 

103.47 105.66 A: get it contained early that would work i would think 

105.19 110.34 B: well okay yeah that is that is quite possible and it is also quite possible you could find another 

110.61 113.67 B: transportation mechanism for whatever the (( )) 

113.19 119.66 A: well true if you're goi- if you i mean if you're going to just spray the area you're screwed but i mean if you're talk if you're relying on person to person transmissions 

114.25 115.17 B: the illness is 

119.14 124.13 B: well no if you incorporate bio-terrorism with nano technology you'll have little guys that will go out and 

124.38 126.60 B: find the people that they're supposed to infect 

127.05 133.48 A: well if you're looking at that you can also you could set up a genetic marker so you could say okay i want people with this genetic trait to get it and nobody else 

133.00 136.83 B: yeah i just want this guy right this guy was sentenced and you don't actually put him in the (( )) you just 

135.97 138.38 A: imagine that in the hands of the clan 

136.96 139.24 B: you just execute 

139.47 141.14 B: but uh fortunately any well 

141.28 143.16 B: see the crudest of things are 

143.38 143.97 B: easily 

144.33 148.23 B: obtainable today you know we already have mustard gas and all that stuff and who knows what they've been working on 

148.56 149.84 B: that stuff is already here 

149.21 152.17 A: heck it's not that tough to build a nuke if you have the materials 

152.60 153.39 B: right although 

153.16 156.53 A: i mean i almost did it as a science fair in high school and that was twenty five years ago 

158.56 161.54 A: i ended up spending six years in sac afterwards flying bombers 

161.60 162.57 B: well 

164.38 166.33 B: maybe you should've had jonathan lithgow as your partner 

171.12 171.68 B: anyway 

172.16 174.57 B: no i don't i don't really think there is any way to stop it 

174.75 175.58 B: cause people are 

175.07 179.37 A: i don't think there is a stop but there are ways to mitigate but i don't think there is a way to stop it straight out 

178.49 178.84 B: yeah 

179.35 183.07 B: and you you you're for now simply locking people down would certainly work but uh 

183.29 184.23 B: uh the 

185.59 187.24 B: it would want to progress to the point where the 

187.36 190.51 B: to think it seek out who it wanted to find then it wouldn't matter if people were sitting there 

190.32 195.32 A: where at that point i'd almost call it nano terrorism not bio-terrorism i'm i'm looking in terms of bio-terrorism using a life form 

194.74 197.75 B: well not necessarily because there are you know (( )) 

197.86 198.30 B: any 

198.68 204.39 B: uh plant propagate just a well no not any plant but many plants propagate by spreading their pollen 

204.53 205.50 B: you know that's why we have 

205.93 207.68 B: hay fever and what not 

208.13 216.30 A: well true but you still have a limited distance you could move the sucker i mean beyond a certain point uh even a even a nano-bot would run out of energy for (( )) and power 

216.38 217.18 B: well no the wind 

218.00 218.95 A: uh depen- 

218.12 221.90 B: and it's something that you release in to the wind (( )) especially if you get a good breezy day 

222.04 223.10 B: going to go all over the place 

222.08 230.10 A: yeah but the question is if if you get to a certain point and say it blows out over the ocean after a certain point you're not going to have enough wind it will settle to water and now it's done 

230.31 231.07 B: that is very true 

231.56 232.84 B: unfortunately i don't know enough 

232.97 233.72 B: about the uh 

234.31 235.81 B: the chemistry itself to know really what 

236.01 237.01 B: what we can and cannot do 

236.83 246.88 A: well it's also a matter of knowing what they're working on at the moment anyhow and uh i know we're in first generation nano-tech but i know we're still about three to four years away from our first generation of (( )) so 

237.34 239.05 B: thankfully (( )) 

247.13 248.97 A: that is where the real fun starts 

249.06 250.84 B: and hopefully it's not like computer where 

251.05 257.36 B: by the time the cool new two thousand three disease comes out the two thousand six disease is already being designed 

257.20 262.05 A: hey and wha- what happens if you run out of your your license for microsoft antibiotics 

261.57 265.09 B: i don't know they might recall you 

265.67 269.04 B: or they might send there own they might send something to you 

266.06 267.35 A: got to do something for fun 

269.35 271.01 B: cause that would be another way to 

271.13 273.30 A: oh hears your upgrade so to speak 

274.94 279.91 A: that is an interesting point if you well if you have an (( )) if you have a nano-tech enabled society 

280.94 283.66 A: literally sending electronic viruses out as bio-terrorism 

284.86 287.61 A: mind you're a fifty to a hundred years from that point but uh 

288.36 290.27 B: oh no by the time you get to that you would have 

290.55 291.75 B: you would certainly be able to 

292.16 296.18 B: uh enforce your copyright because you would the cell just wouldn't do what it was supposed to do 

296.30 303.15 A: well that also assumes they don't develop (( )) active defenses as he put up forth in his creation back in nineteen eighty five 

304.12 305.15 B: i'm not enough familiar with that 

305.47 308.34 A: that was the original the seminal work of nano-technology uh 

308.65 310.51 A: (( )) 

310.87 313.29 B: oh i'm sorry you said that so fast yes i've read that book 

311.71 312.32 A: yeah 

313.76 316.00 B: that's a that's a good story or that that's a good book rather 

315.93 319.14 A: yeah i uh re- my copy's so old it's gotten worn 

317.75 318.15 B: i read it 

318.82 320.97 B: sometime sometime in the mid eighties is when i read it 

321.52 328.05 A: eighty five i think is when it came out i know my one of my bosses is reading it right now he read prey and wanted to know about the real story behind nano-tech 

328.03 329.48 B: oh yeah yeah i enjoyed prey 

329.91 330.68 B: i don't uh 

330.97 331.45 B: i wouldn't 

331.01 335.93 A: i haven't read it yet but then again i've been a little bit uh busy doing other things lately you know fixing up the house and such 

336.68 337.20 B: (( )) 

336.81 340.06 A: i don't i don't know where you're living i'm outside of d._c. so i'm you know sort of 

340.17 344.05 A: uh fixing up the house and also keeping an eye on the fact that we're just about target one 

343.78 345.13 B: right right 

345.59 349.12 B: well i live uh not too far from target two probably i'm in austin 

350.17 356.10 A: well yeah i was well put it this way i used to work in that part of the pentagon i left that job eight months prior 

350.89 352.56 B: well if he's visiting at least 

356.56 359.41 A: if i were to still be working there i would have been in the impact area 

359.99 363.89 B: we went up to dallas a few weeks ago this is not about bio-terrorism 

363.99 365.75 B: coming back it was around waco it was 

366.11 369.15 B: amazing how many circling jets we saw up in the sky 

369.28 369.89 A: oh yeah 

369.65 372.69 B: i wouldn't normally you don't notice that kind of thing 

371.45 375.24 A: and i assume that meant w. was downtown downtown is his little ranch 

374.37 378.58 B: no he was it was over at the ranch yeah or you know somewhere i don't know where the guy is but he was there 

375.89 376.18 A: yeah 

378.76 379.20 A: yeah 

379.17 382.05 B: close enough for and pairs of contrails 

382.13 382.85 A: well yeah 

382.36 383.46 B: (( )) 

383.44 386.11 A: well you get to see that over washington all the time now but then 

386.47 389.72 A: i know there's a national guard fighter unit in washington anyway and they just keep 

389.83 392.44 A: they just keep them busy and rotate nat guard units through 

392.17 392.55 B: yeah 

392.92 393.90 A: cause i think washington 

394.44 399.06 A: wherever the president has a fighter cap i know that much and that's about all i know these days 

399.91 403.47 B: another idea that we could do to combat it is to unleash our 

403.63 408.16 B: children and let them come up with just like kids write most of the viruses let them write the anti-viruses 

408.73 411.00 B: but again how you're not going to let a fourteen 

409.52 412.90 A: well the then again that that's almost like build that's almost building an active defense 

412.57 414.87 B: you're not going to let a fourteen year old in to the chem lab 

415.41 419.30 B: oh an the the the not really related but the on the nano-technology 

419.52 423.06 B: here in uh at university of texas they are building a new nano-technology 

423.26 427.41 B: laboratory for all the scientists to work in because and they actually said this in a side bar 

427.66 428.28 B: to the article 

428.56 433.07 B: under the photograph it said they're building the new nano-technology because the old nano-technology lab 

433.47 434.88 B: was too small 

438.99 447.12 A: well i've got a friend of mine who's a prof out of university of warwick in england and he's been claiming nano-tech works since the early nineties i've been talking to him on and off over the years over the net 

447.81 448.18 B: mm 

449.19 450.41 A: but uh that's a 

451.10 453.66 A: i think the (( )) a player but then again uh 

454.68 461.99 A: once you get nano-tech and we start doing some doing human evolution that a way we may get to the point where we have enough strains that one strain won't be able to uh 

462.15 463.68 A: do a nano-biological attack 

465.50 467.56 B: well that's yeah that's certainly possible too 

467.82 468.24 B: just like 

468.80 471.01 B: generally other uh certain creatures will not 

471.13 473.99 B: even if they did mate with other creatures they would not produce any viable offspring 

474.69 475.59 B: but uh now that's 

476.47 476.86 B: i don't know 

477.01 484.94 B: what the only things humans do really well is modify their environment that's why we're still around cause we don't really have sharp teeth and we can't run that fast yadda yadda yadda 

485.04 485.55 B: so 

485.67 489.02 B: i have total faith that as long as we do not perish 

489.36 490.19 B: we'll will 

489.37 491.23 A: wipe the entire species out 

490.70 493.41 B: yeah wha- wha- or or totally be able to control it 

493.88 495.76 B: to the to and whatever extreme degree 

496.38 500.80 B: yeah for you know forget about make-up once you just program your eyes to look like that 

501.63 505.47 B: you know or whatever but we're getting off the subject of bio-terrorism 

504.80 507.50 A: well it's just there's actually an offshoot of that because uh 

514.58 516.52 A: there different sets of genes or different sets of of 

516.84 519.36 A: defenses mixing together that works in in uh 

519.64 521.96 A: breeding cattle for things that are like uh 

522.31 524.40 A: to make uh them a bit more resistant 

524.80 527.41 A: you know if we just uh spread out the human genome a little bit 

527.90 531.17 A: i think we might be able to do such as well but that's just an idea too 

531.54 532.34 B: right right right 

533.16 534.07 A: you know (( )) 

533.19 533.58 B: (( )) 

534.16 543.60 A: course uh almost as sitting here while we're talking playing a space role playing game so you know that's the other long term solution getting all the eggs out of one basket 

544.70 547.13 B: yes that is the rather long term solution i 

547.44 551.50 A: well actually not really i mean uh i've seen stuff that we could've uh 

551.79 556.06 A: i mean there there is a rumor running around that uh bush is going to announce last night 

556.18 558.59 A: a uh nasa effort to uh 

559.01 562.15 A: put a man on mars in ten years with uh nuclear fission propulsion 

563.47 565.25 A: right you know with uh i guess uh 

564.83 568.27 B: you know this is last night i i don't know if he mentioned that in his speech 

567.46 569.96 A: he didn't it didn't get it got cut out from the speech 

569.47 570.92 B: wasn't in the speech okay 

570.66 573.83 A: but project path finder apparently is a go at nasa
