59.75 63.78 B: how clearly obvious it is whether their what their intentions are 

64.46 65.12 B: um 

65.44 66.44 B: you know like people 

67.36 68.38 B: like it's okay for 

68.50 68.93 B: uh 

69.05 70.36 B: minorities to joke about 

70.66 71.40 B: things that are 

71.57 72.67 B: related to minorities 

73.14 74.27 B: but it's not okay for 

74.59 76.07 B: like white people to get up and 

76.49 77.57 B: make racist jokes 

78.13 83.27 B: not racist jokes but jokes that are centered around race you know like that's not acceptable obviously with 

83.42 84.39 B: almost all people 

84.82 85.70 B: whereas it is if 

86.21 88.36 B: like someone like dave chappelle gets up and does it 

88.63 91.63 B: it's fine you know it's funny or chris rock um 

92.18 94.10 A: well what a- what about when you're in 

94.58 97.95 A: you know like let's say you're a part of a kind of multi e- ethnic group 

98.16 98.58 B: uh-huh 

98.70 100.32 A: and you know everybody has 

100.88 103.28 A: a general understanding that it's all in good humor 

105.18 105.73 B: um 

106.53 107.49 B: well as far as 

107.63 108.83 B: for me i think that's 

109.34 110.86 B: fine you know u- um 

111.03 114.62 B: i mean i'm pretty easy going but i know that there are some people who 

114.94 115.85 B: get offended 

115.96 116.95 B: either way 

117.19 118.55 B: even if they know that it was 

117.27 117.94 A: right 

119.07 119.57 B: meant 

119.69 121.97 B: you know all in good fun they will 

122.20 123.32 B: take offense to that 

123.39 123.78 A: right 

123.87 124.74 B: regardless so 

124.88 126.31 B: uh where do you draw the line 

124.94 125.22 A: right 

126.77 130.40 A: well i guess like like you said you know i think it depends on a lot of 

130.88 131.91 A: a lot of different things 

132.45 133.27 A: um but i think 

133.38 135.77 A: you know kind of the situation or the context in which 

136.42 136.89 A: you know 

137.16 139.77 A: your being humorous is is probably the most important 

140.20 142.49 A: like you said i think if you're among friends and 

143.90 147.07 A: you know and y- and you know it's all going to be all kind of understood 

147.50 150.72 A: an- and you know nobody's going to take offense or nobody's going to find it offens- 

150.87 151.53 A: offensive 

151.76 152.16 B: right 

151.82 152.45 A: rather kind of 

152.55 153.60 A: finding humor in it 

153.91 154.32 A: you know th- 

154.40 155.03 B: the 

154.88 156.61 A: that's that's more acceptable than 

157.57 159.65 A: making a joke at somebody else's expense 

159.99 162.44 A: or making a joke at you know to hurt somebody's feelings 

162.54 163.36 B: right 

163.26 165.49 A: i mean i think that's kind of a good indicator as well 

166.02 166.53 A: you know 

167.36 169.07 A: i think that i would draw the line 

170.02 171.21 A: where it could be hurtful 

171.55 171.95 B: mhm 

173.93 175.93 B: yeah but don't you think that some people are 

176.34 178.01 B: overly sensitive too though 

179.33 180.16 A: um ye- 

179.69 180.48 B: you know i mean 

181.67 182.14 B: i think 

182.64 186.44 B: i kind of agree with what you're saying but i think it um i think it depends a lot more 

187.03 187.70 B: on 

189.09 190.20 B: i think you have to 

190.71 193.76 B: like you're not going to just walk up to a stranger and start joking with them you know 

194.03 194.57 B: (( depends on )) 

194.68 196.58 B: you have to know something about the person like 

197.84 198.47 B: um 

198.87 204.24 B: you have to kind of understand their sense of humor a little bit before you can try and joke with them and you 

204.80 206.51 B: know where to draw the line with them i think 

206.93 208.88 B: kind of different where you draw the line with everyone like 

210.03 210.69 B: um 

212.72 220.44 B: i don't know if you ever made a joke about like someone took a short bus to school or something but like if you know someone then you know that they have a brother or someone who's 

220.79 223.44 B: mentally ill you're not going to make that joke to them you know 

223.70 224.28 A: right 

223.78 226.91 B: whereas if you make it with someone else then it's all in good fun and it's 

227.38 227.85 B: not 

228.13 235.04 B: taken offensively so i think it depends on how close you are with the person and 

233.69 234.96 A: yeah but what if i mean 

236.28 240.02 A: what happens then you know when that person's around doe- does that make it okay to 

240.35 241.49 A: you know joke about 

241.72 242.96 A: let's say retarded people 

243.64 244.24 B: uh 

244.39 245.72 A: knowing that if that person were th- 

244.78 248.44 B: obviously not because you know that that person's going to take offense to it and they're not going to 

247.97 252.69 A: no but what i'm what i'm saying is what if you know your friend is your friend with the handicapped brother isn't there 

253.40 253.82 B: uh-huh 

255.11 257.53 A: and you know you have another friend that you're teasing because he did 

257.68 258.81 A: you know something stupid 

259.24 262.30 A: and y- you know call him retarded i mean shouldn't you not 

259.42 259.80 B: right 

263.47 267.76 A: shouldn't you draw the line there because you know you have a friend whose brother is handicapped 

267.99 271.09 A: and he would get offended if he were there or is that okay because he's not there 

271.33 272.16 B: um 

272.96 274.52 B: i don't know it's a it's a 

275.17 276.14 B: thin line i think 

276.84 277.78 B: um i think 

277.99 281.87 B: you kind of have to decide for yourself whether that's something that's okay for you to joke about 

282.20 282.52 B: but 

283.94 285.93 B: b- i mean you definitely watch what you say you know 

286.25 286.60 A: right 

286.95 288.32 B: depending on who you're around 

288.57 289.02 A: right 

289.00 289.46 B: and 

290.53 290.92 B: i think 

291.95 297.33 B: i mean think about the things that you joke about for almost everything that you joke about with someone there's somebody you could say it to who would get 

297.51 298.97 B: incredibly offended you know 

298.99 299.35 A: right 

300.10 301.60 B: now just about everything so 

302.13 303.16 A: right yeah i mean 

302.78 303.44 B: so i don't know 

303.48 304.55 A: that's definitely true 

303.98 305.83 B: it's it's hard to draw the line because 

307.00 308.38 B: some things you say are not offen- 

308.52 310.99 B: offensive but people are going to get offended regardless 

312.25 312.51 B: so 

313.24 316.73 A: yeah i thinks it's difficult because i think a lot of people you know 

317.56 318.45 A: especially with like 

319.04 322.25 A: racial or ethnic based jokes kind of joke about 

324.47 325.11 A: you know 

325.23 325.87 A: about 

326.12 330.64 A: general statements about you know a certain ethnicity and i think that can be really hurtful because that's just kind of 

331.14 332.98 A: enforcing stereotypes and 

332.76 334.63 B: what about when they are that ethnicity 

336.76 338.21 A: i don't i don't know i mean 

336.88 338.82 B: i i actually agree but um 

339.56 340.07 B: but 

339.61 343.99 A: i mean yeah i- i'm sure it would be less offensive if you know me and all my italian friends were 

344.32 344.99 A: joking about 

345.09 345.50 A: you know 

345.98 350.08 A: what guineas we are or something like that but i but i i don't know if that necessarily makes it okay 

350.66 351.10 B: uh-huh 

351.18 354.00 A: i mean it certainly makes it you know i don't think 

354.88 361.68 A: it would be offensive and maybe i wouldn't draw the line there but if i was you know hanging out with a group of co-workers and i didn't know who was italian or who was not 

362.66 368.71 A: i mean i don't know maybe it's okay t- to cross the line in some situation or maybe the line is drawn at a different place in some situations 

369.24 369.90 B: i think so 

370.95 372.19 B: i think it's drawn different 

372.82 374.56 B: depends on where you are 

375.66 376.19 B: i think 

376.91 377.64 B: um 

378.96 379.66 B: i don't know though 

380.67 382.87 B: i don't know how long do we have to talk for do you know 

382.73 383.77 A: i have no idea 

384.48 385.16 B: um 

385.36 386.50 B: how long have we been talking 

386.87 388.10 A: um i have no idea 

388.58 389.60 A: five minutes maybe 

389.95 390.39 B: that's it 

391.01 391.78 A: i think so 

391.09 391.70 B: um 

393.65 395.38 B: i'm sure we have to talk for at least ten minutes 

396.09 396.77 A: yeah i guess 

397.12 397.47 B: so 

398.03 398.68 B: um 

399.17 400.25 B: what kind of um 

400.63 402.44 B: wait is it oh it's where you draw the line 

403.51 404.32 B: um 

405.92 407.40 A: do you think chris rock is offensive 

408.25 408.81 B: um 

410.17 411.22 B: no but 

413.07 414.25 B: i don't i find him 

414.38 416.08 B: humorous but i think it gets old that 

416.64 417.40 B: every single 

417.77 419.23 B: black comedian has to get up and 

419.58 420.70 B: do that whole thing 

426.32 427.06 B: why is it okay for him 

429.22 434.83 B: white person says anything about someone who is not white then it's like a big deal you know 

434.14 434.54 A: yeah 

435.12 437.11 A: yeah i mean i i think that there are kind of 

437.83 439.04 A: definitely different standards 

437.94 438.23 B: so 

439.13 440.56 B: yeah i that's what i think i don't 

440.85 442.50 B: i don't think it's offensive but i think it's 

442.97 445.18 B: kind of ridiculous the double standards that are applied 

447.39 451.61 A: so it's it's not really you know drawing a line it's j- it's just kind of a result of 

448.81 449.70 B: so 

452.16 453.59 A: you know what's expected and what's 

453.95 455.79 A: what's not or what's cool or what's not 

456.32 457.35 B: yeah i guess that's different 

458.27 458.79 B: uh 

459.56 460.04 B: (( you mean )) 

460.24 460.70 B: uh 

460.94 464.93 B: what comedians do you like or are you not really into that or what 

464.60 466.48 A: what comedians do i like 

465.56 466.17 B: yeah 

466.62 470.63 A: um i'm not really into comedians too much um 

466.77 467.49 B: do you ever watch them 

469.86 470.20 B: oh 

471.08 472.70 A: i mean i think chris rock is funny 

473.26 473.75 A: i mean 

474.23 477.13 A: trying to think who else i think might be i think george carlin's pretty funny 

477.32 477.72 B: uh-huh 

477.89 479.20 A: but he's pretty offensive 

480.80 481.93 A: why what comedians do you like 

482.94 483.67 B: uh 

484.69 486.20 B: chris rock i like dave chappelle 

487.06 487.75 B: sometimes 

488.15 489.57 B: sometimes he gets a little old 

489.71 491.44 A: i don't know wh- i don't know if i know who that is 

490.31 490.63 B: uh 

492.31 495.04 B: dave chappelle he has uh a new show on cable now

506.40 507.43 B: yeah i mean that's 

507.81 510.51 B: he just kind of makes fun of everyday shit you know he's not 

510.76 511.80 B: really offending anyone 

510.83 513.78 A: yeah i could never imagine him really crossing the line 

513.87 515.12 B: yeah he's pretty clean 

516.11 517.03 B: pretty non-offensive 

518.79 519.98 B: uh was that your phone 

520.06 522.21 A: no oh my phones cl- i think clicking or something 

522.59 524.28 B: oh okay i thought that was the prompter

535.11 536.24 A: um well i 

535.70 536.65 B: what about um 

536.71 539.33 A: i mean definitely think there's kind of like a double standard 

540.06 541.13 A: you know there too 

541.72 542.07 B: yeah 

543.20 544.33 B: i was just watching uh

551.27 551.87 B: it was bad 

553.12 554.01 B: some people think that 

555.01 555.50 B: humor 

555.89 557.70 B: or they think it's just kind of trash you know 

558.01 560.36 B: i mean you know that's it's fake but 

558.08 559.86 A: yeah i think that's just kind of sad 

560.52 561.30 B: it's not really 

561.47 561.92 B: helping 

562.10 564.77 B: anyone or anything out it's just kind of 

565.49 566.27 B: degrading 

566.53 567.08 B: society 

567.32 567.85 A: yeah 

568.50 570.07 A: but isn't it all a big
