18.78 20.32 B: okay yeah 

19.51 20.17 A: but uh 

20.65 29.19 B: it's uh i honestly it's something i can't worry too much you know what i'm saying you you just have to get on with life i can't be worrying about buying gas masks 

24.80 25.18 A: why 

29.36 29.93 B: sin- 

30.23 30.83 B: you know 

31.07 31.36 B: those 

31.47 36.22 B: tents that pump pump in the fresh air and all that stuff you see on t._v. you know what i'm saying 

35.91 39.10 A: tents that pump in the fresh uh i haven't seen that 

38.65 42.16 B: oh you haven't seen those they are these like inflatable tents like if it really got 

45.27 45.59 A: oh 

45.97 48.56 A: wow that's got to be some filter on that thing 

49.10 51.45 A: i i live right near d._c. so uh 

51.83 57.21 A: you know it's kind of constant yeah i spent a lot of time going downtown so um 

54.02 54.88 B: really 

58.41 62.62 A: yeah you you it's you know i can see the capitol building from where i work and uh 

63.63 69.03 A: oh you got to you got to worry about it a little bit i mean i i imagine arizona doesn't have a lot of uh 

69.23 71.71 A: hard targets as they say 

71.70 72.68 B: we did have just 

72.95 74.25 B: what was it in november 

74.30 74.69 A: yeah 

74.45 79.40 B: they had um a whole training session here with college students and things like that 

79.63 81.77 B: you know that was pretty interesting i think it was like a three day 

82.35 83.29 B: thing downtown 

83.39 83.86 A: wow 

84.07 93.29 B: you know what i'm saying but like like i don't know if you're married with children or anything but i've got two and i've got you know what i mean so i've got a two year old at home and an eight year old in school and 

93.85 101.68 B: i don't know oh you just got to get on with life and i don't have hundreds and hundreds of dollars to spend on all these gadgets and 

101.92 106.42 B: things and i also don't see arizona as been a real big target of interest 

106.52 110.94 A: well there's not much that we can do around about it here either i mean that's not uh my 

109.78 110.33 B: yeah 

111.29 114.05 A: my daughter is twenty one months so uh y- 

114.15 122.53 A: i worry about it a little bit but since she is not in school you know it doesn't i'm not worried about having to figure out how to get her away and uh my wife and i work 

115.86 116.28 B: right 

123.10 125.19 A: really near where her day care is so 

125.45 132.27 A: we figure you know if something happens at least we can get to her and we can uh all die together or something you know 

130.88 139.68 B: e- exactly i mean that's what i'm saying you know yeah my son's school is like a five minute drive away you know my husband could be home in fifteen minutes and 

139.44 139.84 A: yup 

139.78 142.25 B: you know you just got to do what you got to do 

142.13 143.49 A: yeah well i mean 

144.18 148.06 A: is there anything they can do to stop it who knows i i have i have no idea 

148.20 148.65 A: that's 

149.47 151.53 A: uh luckily not my job that's 

151.19 151.76 B: exactly 

151.91 153.91 A: kind of why we hired them to do the job 

153.49 156.41 B: exactly 

154.19 155.44 A: uh 

155.79 159.97 A: hopefully we have people in there are who are smart enough to figure it out on some level 

160.07 160.65 B: right 

160.18 161.06 A: but uh 

161.85 165.14 A: you know i i like you said you can't worry about it too much i guess 

166.91 172.23 B: i i do- i don't know much beyond that to keep posted you know watch the news read the paper and 

172.36 173.05 A: yeah well 

173.88 174.74 A: there there's 

175.38 178.70 A: two sides to every story in the newspaper depending on which one you read 

178.59 179.55 B: right right 

179.01 179.75 A: so 

179.93 182.72 B: and i also believe there's a lot of things we're not told period 

183.27 184.95 A: yeah well that's true 

184.31 184.86 B: anyway 

185.09 190.36 A: yeah well un- unfortunately the conspiracy theory has come out pretty quickly uh 

185.10 185.67 B: you know 

188.93 190.90 B: (( right )) 

190.82 196.07 A: can't say it's not fun to uh think about it it's kind of like reading science fiction but uh 

196.17 201.42 B: right and you can't you know you don't want to discuss it with children and eight year olds and scare them half to death so 

196.20 196.95 A: yup 

198.88 199.37 A: well 

201.21 205.85 A: w- we're still trying to figure out how we can even watch the news anymore at night you know it 

204.97 205.72 B: oh yeah 

206.02 208.72 B: it uh it's gets very graphic like whoa 

206.05 206.53 A: (( you know it )) 

207.53 217.51 A: yeah it's i mean she she can see all the stuff on you know the t._v. shows for kids her age and she understands it she's got to understand somewhat of what's going on in the t._v. and the news 

216.91 217.50 B: oh yeah 

218.08 218.43 B: yeah 

218.66 222.33 A: so heck we miss the the weather most nights so 

221.67 224.44 B: i know you can just get it on the computer you know okay 

223.37 224.91 A: well that's true 

224.62 227.59 B: you know no no blood and gore and violence 

227.43 234.25 A: yeah or at least you can close the computer screen i mean i have a laptop sitting here so uh i can just close that up and not have to worry about it 

234.12 235.20 B: exactly 

234.40 234.66 A: but 

235.17 235.57 A: huh 

235.75 238.16 A: it's a very odd question to ask 

238.66 243.30 B: i know i i didn't think it would be so heavy i thought it would be a little lighter 

243.54 245.04 A: yeah that that that that 

245.12 250.39 A: wasn't that extreme but i guess they just want us to talk and use different words and 

250.41 251.21 B: yeah i i 

250.68 251.35 A: w- 

251.41 251.80 B: suppose 

251.92 253.37 A: what whatever that means i 

253.45 254.96 B: we seem to be kind of on the same 

255.11 258.99 B: wavelength so so i guess there's not too much debate to go on 

255.71 256.18 A: yeah 

258.59 259.07 A: yeah that would 

259.16 260.96 A: that would've been interesting to have somebody who 

261.13 262.11 A: really thought that 

262.58 263.21 A: you know like 

263.68 264.62 A: that we are all going to die 

265.54 266.32 B: right 

266.01 267.99 A: that that that would've been interesting 

267.72 279.63 B: uh -cause i know for awhile sales here you know after the whole anthrax thing they were showing local uh army navy surplus stores you know were selling out of their gas masks and suits and stuff and 

275.42 275.89 A: mhm 

281.73 282.57 A: well they spend 

282.94 289.94 A: days and days and weeks and weeks teaching army recruits how to put those things on so i figure i couldn't put them on right anyway 

287.53 287.97 B: yeah 

290.31 291.88 B: yeah there would be some gap some leak 

290.32 291.08 A: and 

291.81 293.03 A: yeah and and that u- -d 

293.16 294.08 A: then it's got to be like 

294.35 296.52 A: totally futile so you know 

296.42 299.37 B: yeah and so i'm not going to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth 

299.15 304.87 A: not to mention i have enough trouble finding my keys most of the time i don't think i'm going to know where i put this thing 

302.13 303.02 B: uh you're telling me 

304.60 310.54 B: or this phone the phone was ringing and i couldn't find it for a second i was like oh 

307.01 312.36 A: yeah i understand that oh boy 

314.05 314.50 A: you know 

314.12 314.55 B: so 

314.99 315.38 A: well 

315.01 319.49 B: how long are these conversations do we know or like do they like beep us out when we're done or something 

317.16 317.74 A: no 

319.40 320.57 A: i i'm assuming so 

321.17 322.75 A: it it seems pretty computer 

322.98 326.51 A: generated so i mean they've got to have a time limit on it or something 

326.78 327.21 A: um 

327.82 329.85 B: (( )) do you remember if it said it on the computer stuff 

330.00 331.92 A: no i didn't see it there 

332.03 332.50 A: um 

335.62 341.47 A: no i i you know you got to wonder what they thought we we were going to actually talk about you know for 

342.54 350.60 A: you know ten minutes let's say you know were we actually going to talk about bio terrorism for ten minutes or is that the point is like if we get you started on something 

343.99 344.48 B: i know 

346.87 347.45 B: (( i don't know )) 

351.12 353.40 A: and what are you going to end up talking about instead 

353.86 355.63 B: right and just end up chit chatting 

353.91 354.30 A: yeah 

356.42 360.60 A: what or are you going to talk about uh the the test itself or you know 

356.55 356.92 B: and it's 

361.07 364.52 B: right that would be a good way huh to get some sneaky little insight 

361.53 362.39 A: figure out some kind of 

364.83 365.40 A: weird 

366.22 366.56 B: hm 

366.76 368.05 A: pulled up the page oh 

368.26 369.60 A: ten minutes 

369.56 371.62 B: okay so we've been on the phone about five eh 

371.76 374.34 A: i- i guess i wasn't keep track uh 

373.67 374.05 B: so

495.29 497.14 A: oh yeah that's right

502.64 506.19 A: around here if you don't have a full size basement you are not living in a good house 

506.03 514.47 B: uh well yeah i remember we used to have a basement when i was a kid and my friends would go down there and the whole nine yards but no no no not unless you have a lot of money to pay people to dig you that basement
