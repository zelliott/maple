8.49 10.38 B: i don't know that there's any question about it i 

10.58 13.01 B: certainly couldn't remain calm in a terrorist attack 

14.27 15.98 A: i suppose 

16.45 20.52 A: the question i would have was what's meant by a terrorist attack here 

21.08 25.39 A: you know it's one thing to be in the midst of something like the world trade center incident 

25.26 26.61 B: right and that's what comes to mind 

25.62 27.49 A: another thing to be uh 

28.59 35.30 A: uh you know uh held hostage on a plane by a group of terrorists 

35.13 36.06 B: that's true 

36.02 36.88 A: and so 

37.09 37.93 B: i don't know that you have much 

38.31 40.43 B: choice you really need to remain calm or 

40.77 41.86 B: endanger everybody 

41.98 43.12 A: right uh 

43.50 48.73 B: but i yeah i suppose that's certainly an issue i i guess i automatically think of nine eleven 

49.56 52.12 B: and yeah it's i guess it's situational 

53.63 54.69 A: yeah uh 

55.32 66.50 A: so i i it's a question i would find difficult to answer you know just in a blanket fashion because uh but if if someone for example said that uh 

66.80 70.42 A: there was uh you know poison gas or uh 

70.53 73.52 A: some sort of biological toxin spreading throughout 

73.69 74.59 A: uh a building 

75.30 76.41 A: uh you know i 

76.62 82.90 A: i could see yeah uh uh the urge to panic being being very uh 

85.06 86.98 B: i think it's a natural urge because people just 

87.20 88.15 B: don't confront this 

89.01 90.83 B: in their normal lives but 

91.41 98.53 B: again in something like that i i think the urgency is again you need to get out you need to stay alive you need to not endanger anybody else 

96.97 97.36 A: hm mhm 

99.08 99.58 B: so 

99.68 100.93 B: getting out becomes 

101.24 102.62 B: the most important thing and 

103.65 106.30 B: you know if you don't do that in an orderly fashion then nobody gets out 

106.41 106.78 B: so 

106.88 107.63 A: yeah 

108.03 116.54 A: well and and then two there's the question of whether uh you know in the immediacy of the situation there's anything you can do to help anyone else 

116.21 116.59 B: right 

116.99 118.52 A: uh so for example uh 

118.91 119.32 A: i 

119.65 121.60 A: i'd like to think eh y- 

122.14 123.17 A: if i were in the world 

125.72 126.44 A: two towers 

126.80 130.40 A: i'd be helping people down the stairs or uh something but 

130.50 134.41 A: it's it's hard to say uh it's hard to know what what you'd do under those 

135.01 136.60 A: those circumstances but uh 

136.84 138.52 B: and what you're able to do i mean uh 

138.89 141.88 B: in a situation like that where there's so many thousands of people 

142.35 145.87 B: are you able to help anybody else are you able to move are you able to 

146.07 146.47 A: hm mhm 

146.77 147.21 B: i mean 

147.28 151.59 B: just what are you capable of doing to help anyone help yourself let alone anybody else 

151.76 152.79 A: right 

152.65 153.61 B: so 

153.71 157.41 B: uh yeah i i can't imagine i i think my first reaction is 

157.97 158.83 B: oh my god 

159.24 159.79 B: and 

160.11 164.23 B: flight you know and then yeah if i can help anybody along the way 

164.75 166.38 B: certainly you want to think you would do that 

168.10 171.47 A: i i can imagine for example that you know if i if 

171.98 172.47 A: if 

182.99 183.35 B: right 

184.06 184.46 B: right 

185.90 187.71 A: there there'd be uh 

188.16 189.16 A: i'd i'd like to think i 

189.31 194.89 A: i'd be able to you know remain calm although it might be more more a matter of 

192.10 192.36 B: i 

195.27 196.95 A: frozen panic than uh 

198.45 204.82 B: i i um guns guns are not my favorite topic and and i think confronted with weapons like that you know you talk about 

201.54 202.21 A: no 

205.20 207.32 B: poison gas or bombings and 

207.04 207.45 A: hm mhm 

207.94 211.53 B: but boy when you talk about somebody pointing a gun at me i 

212.34 214.91 B: i don't know i i i have no idea 

215.20 216.61 B: what i would do or how i'd react 

217.07 218.21 B: i think my 

218.71 221.16 B: first reaction would be to do exactly what they tell me to do 

221.84 222.13 B: but 

222.56 224.65 B: i i i don't know i just 

224.30 224.88 A: well but that 

224.99 228.33 A: you know that clearly isn't the case of panicking it seems to me eh 

225.12 226.10 B: hope i never have to know 

230.39 231.80 A: i guess my i think of 

231.93 234.14 A: panicking as as a matter of that sort of 

233.96 234.85 B: uncontrolled 

234.74 239.57 A: uncontrolled eh sometimes random response to uh 

235.38 235.82 B: yeah 

240.24 241.39 A: uh a threat 

241.51 242.55 A: uh but 

242.11 245.42 B: and i think if you're if if you've got that much fear bottled up inside you 

246.20 246.78 B: maybe that 

247.48 250.99 B: all that you can do maybe that's all you can do for certain people 

250.41 251.75 A: yeah that's possible (( )) 

254.17 258.35 B: i don't know i hope i never have to find out it's a terrible world we live in that we have to even 

258.27 261.51 A: well you know the other circumstances i mean the other sort of 

258.58 259.10 B: think about 

261.61 266.64 A: contrasting cases would be you know which uh the situation where you're alone or where you got 

274.12 274.49 B: hm mhm 

275.52 276.06 A: spouse 

277.13 277.77 A: you know that you 

279.10 281.16 A: happens to them may depend upon what you do 

281.26 284.20 B: oh and i think absolutely and i mean as a mother 

284.73 285.88 B: absolutely i've thought 

286.06 292.73 B: you know there's nobody who is ever going to harm my child and and you can imagine yourself a whole different way when you're in that situation 

288.62 289.02 A: hm mhm 

293.69 296.60 B: again i just hope i never am forced to do that 

297.01 297.95 B: i ew 

298.43 298.96 B: i don't know 

299.26 299.85 A: yeah 

299.79 301.11 B: it's very scary to think about 

300.00 300.31 A: right 

303.82 308.67 A: so i an- it just seems to me that you know part of the problem with the question they gave us is you you have to sort of 

309.50 311.70 A: divide it up into into different cases eh 

312.14 312.60 B: yeah 

313.16 317.02 B: yeah the unfortunately in this world there's too many types of terrorism out there 

317.09 317.34 A: yep 

317.40 319.74 B: it's too difficult to generalize you're right 

317.82 318.30 A: oh yeah 

321.58 322.86 A: i suppose the uh 

324.38 325.28 A: the real issue 

326.43 330.74 A: you have to face is you know what are the odds that such a situation would arise 

331.40 339.04 A: normally in in in a home you know in your home situation it's probably unlikely but if you're traveling for example 

338.78 339.18 B: sure 

339.36 341.02 A: then you you do have to sort of 

341.33 343.59 A: think about the the prospect of such a 

343.90 346.89 B: especially if it's overseas travel or you know foreign travel 

344.28 345.01 A: situation arise 

345.62 345.95 A: yeah 

347.40 351.11 B: oh do you live in a in a urban area or a rural area 

359.66 360.49 A: serious terrorist 

360.64 364.18 A: incident could happen but of course i live within eighty five miles of uh 

362.18 362.63 B: and yet you 

364.08 364.87 B: flight ninety three 

365.02 369.91 A: um yeah it and and i live within eighty five miles of three mile island 

365.81 366.26 B: yeah 

370.30 371.45 B: oh my 

370.56 371.08 A: uh 

371.23 371.90 A: so 

371.55 372.00 B: ew 

372.06 374.06 A: uh there are uh 

376.59 378.33 A: and uh actually i guess i'm 

376.64 377.04 B: are you 

378.45 378.80 A: there 

379.11 379.93 A: you know within 

380.43 381.63 A: fifty miles there are 

382.52 382.87 A: three 

384.86 385.37 B: wow 

384.98 386.81 A: that you can imagine someone 

387.76 388.90 A: causing to 

390.22 391.10 A: explode and and 

392.12 392.65 A: clouds of 

401.06 403.52 B: are you anywhere near woodwards or lewis- 

403.67 405.03 B: -burg or any of those areas 

405.29 405.79 A: yes 

405.95 407.10 B: are you that's interesting 

407.44 411.46 B: my son went to camp there that's why i ask and we love the that particular region so 

409.26 409.57 A: hm mhm 

411.88 413.08 B: we've been there two years in a row 

416.13 425.20 A: yeah terrorist uh incidents occurring but uh of course having lived you know through the three mile island incident you you can think of other 

416.84 417.79 B: terrorism yeah 

425.48 425.96 B: sure 

425.60 428.80 A: you know (( )) if certain non accidental uh 

428.92 430.73 A: uh cases uh 

431.16 433.93 B: of course i'm only a hundred and fifty miles from new york city so 

431.26 431.62 A: (( )) 

433.68 434.54 A: hm mhm yep 

434.68 436.34 B: you know it's it um 

436.63 439.81 B: the twin towers are certainly close hitting fairly close to home so 

436.79 437.21 A: yeah 

439.94 443.88 A: you can imagine you know some some terrorists setting off some uh 

444.17 446.02 A: sort of suitcase atomic bomb and 

446.53 448.38 A: in a place like new york city 

448.22 448.48 B: hm 

450.85 453.36 B: depending on what it was the the clouds would 

451.25 451.63 A: or 

453.51 455.71 B: probably reach my area anyway or there 

455.41 455.73 A: yeah 

455.88 462.90 A: yeah yeah so it's it's you know even if you live in in in a non urban area it's uh possible you might 

463.17 464.21 A: find yourself having to 

464.36 468.43 A: face the effects uh of of a terrorist incident 

469.52 473.44 A: i guess i tend to think of them as uh terrorist attacks as more 

473.82 475.09 A: the sorts of things 

475.25 477.16 A: i'm likely to run into when traveling 

477.51 480.13 A: because i i live in pennsyl- pennsylvania 

480.64 483.00 A: it's you know relatively 

483.46 484.79 A: remote from 

485.42 489.06 A: areas of terrorist concern i i i normally think 

489.63 490.36 A: but uh 

491.03 493.44 B: but in this day and age you don't know where they're going to hit 

492.46 493.94 A: you don't know 

493.55 493.99 B: yeah 

494.07 494.42 A: yeah 

494.61 495.02 B: yeah 

495.99 497.84 B: we had hoped to go overseas 

498.64 503.46 B: last year um my mother is getting older and she had wanted to do the panama canal cruise 

503.54 503.98 A: uh huh 

504.16 504.59 B: but 

505.25 505.77 B: it was 

506.29 506.75 B: i mean it was 

506.90 509.09 B: six months or so after nine one one 

509.42 512.63 B: she felt very uncomfortable traveling out of the country so we just didn't go
