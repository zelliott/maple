6.62 8.56 B: hello andrew nice to meet you 

7.62 9.28 A: (( hello nice to meet you )) 

9.85 15.23 B: okay let's see the topic of the day is how do you draw the line between acceptable and a sense of humor 

15.52 21.00 A: yeah it's kinda hard because some people are very easily offended 

21.10 22.47 B: yes this is true 

21.19 27.45 A: and some are not i mean people like me i've got a real warped sense of humor i've had brain cancer 

27.21 28.13 B: mhm 

27.50 32.73 A: so um [cough] to me everything's pretty much funny but it just depends 

33.42 42.40 A: also it's on your audience wh- wh- i- i- if you're with your mother you can't tell you know certain jokes but you know your friends that's pretty much acceptable 

42.77 48.33 B: um th- there's some truth to that i i certainly change my humor based on who i'm with 

47.93 49.55 A: (( yeah )) 

48.34 49.38 B: um 

50.11 57.72 B: [sigh] i i think i find it really interesting because um i grew up a i i'm half polack half hillbilly blonde and a woman [laughter] 

55.53 60.24 A: [laughter] well my wife's hillbilly too so that's okay that's great 

60.09 67.77 B: [laughter] and ah and an- and i grew up to become a chemical engineer so i'm obviously not stupid [laughter] 

65.18 68.61 A: oh okay you're not stupid you're very intelligent 

68.29 78.49 B: [laughter] so you know but even in school and stuff i i mean at my house um hillbilly jokes and polack jokes it was kind of along the things of of we just told those things and we didn't worry about it a- 

74.39 77.30 A: (( yep )) 

78.51 82.86 B: a- and so um i grew up kind of viewing jokes as as jokes 

83.06 89.26 B: but but i had a friend who uh no i had a couple of friends but one in particular who ah 

89.31 102.56 B: just a year or two ago really enlightened me that it really affected their own personal self esteem um to hear a certain i- i- it wasn't it wasn't one of these nasty things where they were all defensive it was more a thing of ah 

95.19 96.29 A: oh boy 

102.61 116.42 B: he was talking in general about how having grown up in the seventies and an- an- and that very feminist culture an- an- the whole man bashing th- th- that he had actually realized that as he grew up that he was very ashamed of being a man 

110.26 112.05 A: oh yeah 

116.50 127.27 B: and so you know an- an- and didn't know what was what was good and what was bad and so it was very interesting that that ah i realized that on a very subtle level 

127.48 138.53 B: that those kinds of jokes really could hurt somebody so i'm i think i'm a little more careful about it now i still pretty much'll tell anything but i really do have a tendency to target my audience and and deal with people who 

136.74 138.60 A: yes you have to 

139.21 148.53 B: a- and try to do it instead of it being a thing of i i just tell jokes and hope no one gets offended i now kind of make sure that these are pretty stable 

147.97 149.72 A: yeah 

148.68 158.14 B: secure in their own person people before i tell those kind of jokes now even things i used to think were pretty harmless like blonde jokes and man bashing jokes so 

156.35 161.49 A: oh yeah yeah well today we- ev- everybody is so sensitive 

161.60 162.42 B: mhm 

161.76 163.73 A: you know you can't say black sheep wi- wi- 

164.02 165.71 A: without offending someone 

165.92 166.88 A: so 

167.80 170.54 A: as an engineer also structural 

170.66 171.43 B: oh 

171.13 176.57 A: yeah and ah had a brain tumor and lost all my skills so i'm unemployed 

172.16 172.92 B: cool 

176.62 178.97 B: oh that just is horrible 

178.28 180.41 A: oh yeah well it's typical i mean look 

181.30 183.21 A: i'm alive so i can't complain 

183.57 185.69 B: good point good attitude 

184.25 186.88 A: my friends are all dead my friends are all dead so 

187.59 188.53 A: um 

189.50 197.15 A: as a minister i was a minister first and my wife passed away i could i couldn't go days i got poed and decided to go go to be an engineer i 

197.93 202.65 A: became an engineer and i really i really enjoyed it because the challenge the math challenge 

203.32 212.50 A: but ah in engineering th- th- they're so anti women i thought oh come on what are they going to do you know give you p._m._s. jeeze 

212.81 213.76 A: um 

213.77 214.34 A: (( [cough] )) 

214.46 225.39 A: i hear a lot of jokes you know in in the boardroom especially i thought uh oh wait a minute this is not cool no we don't discuss things like that [lipsmack] but it's really a matter of you know a matter of taste 

225.17 226.20 B: mhm 

226.04 229.70 A: some peop- some people can take a joke some people can't 

229.70 230.64 B: this is true 

230.50 244.89 A: my wife's son has no sense of humor everything is dead serious i'm like get a grip [laughter] i had i've had radiation and chemotherapy about three different times hey life has to be joy or you're a pain in the butt to be around [laughter] 

243.19 246.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

245.30 249.77 A: yeah and that's what i i i tell people give life the light touch 

250.31 256.14 A: it really doesn't matter okay twenty years from now who really cares if you're a vice president you know 

256.87 260.00 A: so that's really about my really about my life but 

259.68 260.72 B: mhm 

260.77 272.47 A: i- i- i work with cancer patients and i tell them you know develop a sense of humor why because people like being around someone who's happy and telling jokes than someone who's a whiner and a complainer yuck i hate whiners 

273.76 279.34 B: [laughter] um i have a high tolerance for everybody including whiners 

278.75 291.62 A: yeah well it's like okay i know you're sick you've got cancer but you know you can make you can make this the worst thing in your life or the best thing in your life it's what do you want to do with it it's up to you 

279.38 281.25 B: [laughter] 

292.08 300.24 B: that's true but y- you know that's just remember that's kind of a learned skill too i mean i know people who have pretty okay lives all things considered and they're very unhappy 

299.12 301.39 A: (( mhm )) 

301.80 311.40 B: part of it's attitude but part of it really is i- l- learning to face adversity and overcome it is a learned skill it's not it's not always 

312.34 318.95 B: [sigh] it's not always as easy as deciding whether you want hamburgers or or steak for dinner or if if 

317.74 319.36 A: (( yeah i- i- it's tough )) 

318.97 321.18 B: i- i- it's like teaching 

321.44 327.71 B: in some ways it's kind of like it it it's as hard as learning another language an- an- 

327.86 328.93 B: or 

329.30 337.42 B: you know because it is a y- y- you have to teach yourself or even a whole new way to think i- it's not just about um 

335.21 336.40 A: yeah 

339.11 341.42 B: [sigh] you have to train your wh- 

341.19 355.62 B: wh- or like being on an exercise regime you know you gotta be on it for years before you get good at it and and really you see some benefits right away but the truth is is learning to think positive and and to put a good spin on things and to look for the best 

347.34 348.27 A: yeah 

355.42 367.26 B: as i said it- it's really hard to get into the habit of it it's really easy to screw up and fall off of it even once you've developed the habit unless it's something you were raised with and you think of it like breathing 

367.22 370.18 A: well um i'm a cancer counselor 

367.68 368.55 B: um 

370.55 371.35 B: mhm

372.99 373.89 B: mhm 

373.57 375.49 A: i work in hospice usually 

375.25 376.20 B: mhm 

376.06 378.41 A: and i tell people 

378.51 382.19 A: you you can make this the worst thing in your life or the best thing in your life it's really up to you 

382.48 383.43 B: mhm

408.67 409.51 A: you know 

409.87 415.15 A: but through cancer i've learned a you know life really dos- doesn't matter all that much 

415.71 416.56 B: mhm

439.53 448.32 A: you're dying okay make this the best thing or the worst thing of your life okay if you want to be a cry baby fine cry but no one's going to be around you 

443.86 444.81 B: mhm 

449.05 450.90 A: when you laugh people want to be around you 

453.14 457.97 B: by the way there's a since you do a lot of counseling there's a set of books out um 

457.73 469.88 B: the one that i got and have been reading is how to raise the optimistic child but there's a couple of others about and there's about how to become optimistic instead of pessimistic an- and i i think it's a really great set of books
