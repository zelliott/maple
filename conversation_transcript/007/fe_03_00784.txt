1.30 4.11 B: hi my name high my name is cynthia 

1.56 2.60 A: hi 

4.39 6.13 A: my name's dan is 

10.88 13.87 A: this the first time ah you're doing this 

12.97 15.00 B: yes it is actually 

14.78 18.54 A: yeah me too [laughter] 

17.49 20.71 B: i guess we'll probably make some mistakes [laughter] 

20.00 23.18 A: [laughter] ah 

25.02 27.24 B: did they ask you the question already 

27.26 32.34 A: ah they they said something about ah if i wanted if i started my own business 

31.97 33.21 B: mhm 

32.98 36.39 A: (( yeah and they wanted to know )) 

34.62 36.06 B: well what would you do 

36.85 39.46 A: um i would probably 

39.78 41.84 A: um start my own 

41.94 46.68 A: um repair fix and repair shop i like to 

47.12 51.28 A: dabble in a lot of things fixing things 

51.33 62.91 B: oh okay well i would like to ah open up ah a shelter for um homeless people um as well as a a cafeteria 

63.29 64.95 A: oh that would be nice 

63.72 77.76 B: albeit um not just not just for the homeless people though the ah cafeteria would be for any anybody that would ah you know be hungry because we have a lot of working poor people 

78.05 79.88 A: (( right )) 

78.19 86.57 B: and a lot of people that have to um unfortunately decide on paying a bill or feeding the kids 

86.50 93.81 A: yeah i just watched a special the other night they were showing about the food lines in ohio how long they were 

86.62 88.16 B: and 

93.45 94.70 B: ah huh 

94.38 100.94 A: they said most of the people were working they just couldn't afford to buy enough food to keep them going 

100.73 103.77 B: right and um th- that's a 

103.80 105.12 B: terrible 

105.29 116.52 B: state to find yourself in and children don't understand um i don't have enough money to buy food they don't understand that they just know that they're hungry 

116.24 118.31 A: (( right )) 

116.85 128.32 B: so if um money was not an object [laughter] and i could do whatever i wanted to do if somebody just wrote me out a blank check and said [laughter] here you go 

128.35 137.27 B: then i would open up um those type of i guess it would really be considered a non for profit ah organization 

137.22 145.84 B: or business um all around the country because i know it's not just one particular part of the country 

145.89 159.31 B: ah that's hurting in that area it's all across the board so if i had a blank check and they said to me this is you can do whatever you want to do with it that's what i would do [laughter] 

158.99 161.87 A: wouldn't that be nice [laughter] 

160.93 166.89 B: yeah that's what i would do if i had that kind of money but you know 

165.98 170.35 A: yeah i guess i'm not thinking on a big enough scale here [laughter] 

169.47 173.65 B: well no that's not necessarily true because they didn't say 

173.63 179.04 B: ah you know what ah i- i guess they just wanted to know how you 

173.67 175.68 A: yeah 

179.00 181.69 B: how you felt and what you were thinking about and this 

181.65 194.72 B: i was thinking about this for so long that this is what i would like to do and i guess it's because of my own experiences that you know that i've had to deal with um um 

193.14 194.52 A: right 

194.88 206.35 B: ah fortunately all of my children are grown now [laughter] so i don't have to i don't have to make that choice you know or i'm not caught there anymore but 

206.36 213.86 B: just the way society is going and especially what happened after september eleven 

214.07 220.94 B: and the ah state of the economy but you know what actually th- 

214.08 215.37 A: right 

220.83 234.77 B: um opening up ah the shop that you were talking about could definitely work too because there's a lot of people that don't have cars and need transportation and you know the like the national lung association and 

234.81 241.88 B: ah different kidney organization they take old cars and they fix them up so that 

241.87 256.66 B: um people that are low income people that don't have cars you know they give them cars so they can get back and forth and get jobs and stuff like this so we need people that would have shops that would be willing to [laughter] do that 

250.43 252.09 A: yeah 

256.02 263.94 A: yeah because i i've done a lot of that i've um when people get new refrigerators or stoves or something like that 

263.91 276.26 A: they ah get me to haul their old ones off if they're if they're in working condition and i take them out clean them up and then i'll sell them to people who i know who can't afford to buy a new one and 

269.05 270.55 B: mhm 

275.24 276.43 B: mhm 

276.16 284.02 A: all i just sell for is you know to get the money out of what i put into it and a little bit of time you know 

281.08 282.47 B: mhm 

284.02 291.91 B: so sweet a- and all of it working together [laughter] we need all four stores all come together 

284.43 285.53 A: (( right )) 

287.33 288.90 A: (( yeah )) 

291.73 293.70 A: (( yeah )) 

293.03 301.43 B: so you just ah you just do what you know to do or what you're gifted in the areas that you're gifted in and then 

301.32 311.52 B: the other person in the areas that they're gifted in they do what they know what to do but then if all the pieces fit in together in the puzzle to make a whole picture 

311.89 317.85 A: 'cause pretty much what i do is almost about the same thing as salvation army and ah 

318.00 321.49 A: um st paul's and places like that do too 

321.28 322.55 B: mhm 

322.67 324.09 A: (( and )) 

323.03 328.68 B: so see that's real important because if we didn't have them then um 

328.79 337.11 B: um um they call them mentally challenged they wouldn't have a job or or they wouldn't be able to teach them skills 

332.60 334.07 A: (( ah right )) 

337.10 346.84 B: so that that's important and they would be just you know sitting somewhere wasting away well that's a valuable life so everybody has value 

337.15 338.33 A: (( right )) 

346.91 356.86 B: um no matter what state you may see me in right now don't mean that i'm not any more valuable than you so i feel i'm just as valuable as donald tramp trump or 

356.69 366.81 B: or or bill gates [laughter] you know so they just have more money than me [laughter] [laughter] but that don't make them better people 

356.92 358.04 A: that's right 

362.69 364.24 A: that's about it 

366.55 373.23 A: money is about the only difference in us [laughter] yeah because i- i've been down to the bottom 

368.34 371.91 B: mhm so no they're not better people 

373.06 385.26 A: before i've had ah some operations and my wife was pregnant at the time so we had to go all the way down to the welfare and go on to the food lines and everything else you know 

381.66 382.87 B: mhm 

385.09 398.22 A: that ah now i'm doing a little better now but you know some of our best times were back when we were scrounging you know it seemed like you were closer to the family and every thing so i know what it's like 

387.56 388.62 B: mhm 

391.71 392.88 B: mhm 

398.34 404.37 B: yeah that brings you ah those times would definitely bring out worth in you 

404.42 416.39 B: [laughter] and you have to ah you know you have to stay focused and just remember that it's not always going to be like this and one day it's going to get better but then that's when you truly find out who your real friends are 

416.62 421.55 A: yeah i wouldn't mind meeting this person who's going to give us the blank check though [laughter] 

420.92 429.62 B: i wouldn't mind meeting him either [laughter] [laughter] i don't know who they have set up to do that but ah 

427.74 430.53 A: (( [laughter] )) 

429.63 431.95 B: i don't have a problem with it 

431.11 434.84 A: yeah i've never had that offer before [laughter] 

434.08 438.53 B: me neither i guess that's why they said it's a hypothetical situation 

437.14 440.21 A: yeah [laughter] 

438.82 444.98 B: let you know right up up front nobody's coming knocking on the door telling about you just won the lottery 

444.78 446.79 A: yeah [laughter] 

445.71 453.27 B: or if you if you could what would you do with all the money yeah okay [laughter] okay sir i'll play the game okay 

450.61 452.25 A: [laughter] 

453.51 455.90 B: all right yeah i can do this 

455.61 457.32 A: it'd be interesting 

455.95 459.56 B: i don't remember the other questions do you remember the other question 

459.40 460.82 A: um 

461.56 465.22 A: i i no i didn't catch the very end of it 

465.85 474.04 A: i was trying to get my earphone hooked on here because i i hate sitting here with the phone stuck up to my head [laughter] 

472.49 474.20 B: (( oh oh okay )) 

474.35 479.22 B: well i don't remember what the last part of it is do you think they're going to count that against us 

479.43 481.39 A: no i don't think so 

480.54 483.28 B: [laughter] i don't remember 

481.56 488.29 A: [laughter] my memory's not that good anymore [laughter] 

484.14 485.67 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

487.18 494.12 B: oh i know i wonder how long they give you to talk and then they say okay time is up 

494.00 503.13 A: yeah i think they said it's about ten minutes they'd ah the computer would come on and tell you your time's almost up 

502.49 503.83 B: (( oh okay )) 

504.51 506.40 A: but 

505.84 507.87 B: well then we talk for ten minutes 

508.24 511.15 A: (( ah i don't know what time it was when i started )) 

513.49 517.43 B: [laughter] well i guess they'll let us know when our time is up 

517.27 519.25 A: [laughter] 

518.49 522.94 B: but ah a- g- good luck on your endeavor
