18.94 22.24 B: bio-terrorism is it something you give a lot of thought to 

22.51 25.89 A: i i don't worry about it too much um 

25.99 28.92 A: you know it is not something that keeps me up nights or 

29.33 34.50 A: you know gives me an ulcer or anything um but you know if asked i 

34.84 36.78 A: i guess it is something i i think about 

36.96 38.28 A: i i think i kind of just 

39.36 44.18 A: really give that responsibility to the the powers that be to to curve that one 

44.42 44.91 A: um 

45.69 48.47 B: i i don't think about it that much myself 

48.84 49.21 B: (( and i )) 

48.91 49.50 A: yeah 

49.66 50.29 B: i don't even 

51.19 52.58 B: worry that much about 

52.89 56.31 B: like anthrax in the mail even you know i've never even 

56.03 56.79 A: yeah 

56.46 59.86 B: i never even think about that when i when i pick up the mail 

60.26 62.90 A: uh-huh yeah i i think yeah it it's never been an issue 

63.33 64.03 A: um 

63.67 64.69 B: really 

64.79 66.46 A: for me yeah even when it was 

66.58 68.40 A: even when it was happening 

68.64 69.71 A: it wasn't something that 

69.95 74.43 A: i felt that you know i had to leave my mail in the mailbox or bring my microwave oven out there to 

75.28 76.09 A: check my mail 

75.30 75.93 B: exactly 

77.22 78.02 B: what are the 

77.45 77.88 A: uh 

78.59 79.44 B: chances of 

79.99 84.22 B: (( felt )) of eco- ter- (( )) not i mean eco-terrorists sorry and uh 

83.22 83.70 A: uh-huh 

83.95 84.54 A: that is alright 

84.74 86.70 B: is what th- that is a different topic 

86.96 87.46 A: yeah 

87.62 88.10 B: um 

88.44 92.18 B: well these terrorists are getting in to our water supply i don't think that is 

92.82 93.92 B: very possible 

94.43 94.96 A: uh-huh 

95.88 96.39 B: um 

97.42 98.43 B: and around here 

98.95 100.32 B: this is not an area that 

100.43 101.19 B: that uh 

101.77 104.83 B: i think is you know a real hot spot for uh 

105.53 106.04 A: yeah 

105.92 106.90 B: this sort of uh 

107.37 108.36 B: thing happening 

109.09 110.42 A: mhm that that 

109.67 110.34 B: eh if that 

111.68 112.20 A: go ahead 

112.28 116.28 B: i was going to say i think that los angeles would be 

116.11 116.66 A: yeah 

116.57 117.51 B: you know that that that 

117.80 120.95 B: they have all kinds of things they can do like in long beach 

121.57 122.30 A: uh-huh 

122.23 125.77 B: if they uh you know i don't know i don't we don't know how se- 

125.88 126.47 B: you know how 

126.97 129.25 B: (( )) that the ships coming and going how 

130.42 134.54 B: well they can monitor all the activity there something could slip in 

133.63 134.09 A: course 

136.43 139.26 B: far as but then again too as far as terrorist cells 

139.38 140.39 B: go uh i 

140.78 142.44 B: you may not know this but uh 

142.58 145.23 B: dearborn michigan has the highest uh 

145.80 147.68 B: uh concentration of uh 

147.80 151.13 B: well then i'll say arab americans in the united states but it 

150.12 150.63 A: uh-huh 

150.92 151.64 A: oh really 

151.64 152.22 B: uh-huh 

152.66 154.27 A: oh no i had no idea 

153.13 153.58 B: so we 

154.22 162.82 B: we don- we actually kind of joke around a little bit that that osama bin laden is actually you know living in dearborn or something you know at this point in time 

162.37 162.91 A: how funny 

163.01 164.46 A: yeah an- uh 

163.61 164.18 B: right 

164.56 166.56 A: i i thought about that you know -cause they've 

166.71 175.88 A: whenever they they do attack they they choose something that is symbolic that is going to you know reverberate and you know i i've 

176.55 177.93 A: on occasion weighed 

178.64 179.91 A: the symbolic 

180.10 184.87 A: you know weight that los angeles or it's surroundings carries and 

185.45 186.50 A: i i just can't 

186.71 188.94 A: think of anything i mean hollywood 

189.44 191.35 B: they could take out the hollywood 

191.93 193.61 A: um the sign or 

192.98 193.68 B: (( -ign )) 

193.79 194.16 B: right 

193.83 195.32 A: you know that i mean it's um 

195.47 197.83 A: i guess hollywood is a big industry i don't know 

198.96 202.97 A: but nothing has ever really struck a chord of of terror with me until 

203.76 204.68 B: how about (( )) 

204.23 205.51 A: it makes me worry about it the same 

205.52 206.97 B: how about earthquakes 

207.25 210.01 A: you know i grew up here in southern california 

210.15 212.94 A: and uh you know i've i've been through several 

213.64 214.42 A: and 

214.55 216.05 A: none of them really have 

216.94 218.54 A: been to worrisome so far 

218.90 219.60 B: you were in that 

219.16 222.70 A: i think the biggest ones that i've experienced i was out camping 

223.38 225.35 A: you know and was near to the epicenter 

225.57 226.24 B: uh-huh 

225.83 227.04 A: but it at that point you know it is 

227.21 229.66 A: trees moving back and forth and it is 

229.33 229.79 B: right 

230.37 232.60 A: it was it was actually a lot more fun there 

233.46 237.71 A: because i didn't worry about anything falling on me i didn't worry about trees getting knocked over 

237.98 239.45 B: you knew it was happening 

240.06 240.51 A: yeah 

240.79 241.24 A: mhm 

241.42 246.59 B: is there ah uh now this this this for the sake of this study is there uh 
246.78 248.66 B: in a possibility 

249.12 251.44 B: of of terrorists setting off a 

251.55 254.50 B: kind of a crude nuclear device in a in a 

254.76 255.78 B: in a fault 

256.46 257.64 B: say somewhere in the 

257.54 258.01 A: (( no )) 

257.89 259.55 B: say in andrea's fault 

260.05 263.90 B: would that and i'm just wondering would that could that anything like that trigger 

260.06 260.39 A: hm 

264.70 265.46 B: (( size )) 

264.77 267.17 A: i i have no idea 

266.98 268.25 B: (( )) that would be 

267.30 267.69 A: that 

269.28 271.33 B: a big mess like nineteen eighty 

271.50 274.13 B: nine was and that when san francisco the bay area 

273.80 275.13 A: yeah yeah yeah 

275.05 275.83 B: horrible one 

275.47 276.66 A: i i wonder 

276.76 279.11 A: it did just seems to me that 

279.23 282.50 A: you know uh a nuclear device is a big thing but 

283.30 284.26 A: it seems to me that 

284.51 287.08 A: you know tectonic plates are a lot bigger 

288.02 289.16 A: and uh well it 

289.47 291.89 A: would make a big hole in the ground i'm not sure that 

293.40 294.83 A: that a big bomb would 

294.97 297.23 A: be enough to to set off a big 

297.52 298.23 A: earthquake 

299.32 299.90 B: you got a 

299.68 300.28 A: i don't know 

300.35 301.01 B: i think that is a 

301.13 302.55 B: a a very good point 

303.12 303.54 B: uh -eah 

303.33 307.42 A: i mean su- you know the super the original superman movie played on that one and uh 

308.00 308.45 A: you know 

308.85 313.00 B: well there you go i don't remember i i vaguely remember now that you mentioned it yes 

311.70 312.78 A: yeah 

313.88 314.31 B: now (( )) 

313.94 315.09 A: you know uh but i'm not 

315.37 317.39 A: uh as i think about it i'm not sure 

318.59 323.44 A: it just seems to me that the these plates are a big (( )) to get an earthquake you have to get a 

324.15 324.93 A: a pretty 

325.59 326.00 A: you know 

326.31 329.98 A: big build up or big movement and i don't know maybe you could 

330.87 331.31 B: oh yeah 

330.98 331.74 A: but uh 

332.34 333.69 A: yeah that that would be interesting 

334.04 334.79 B: right 

335.77 336.73 B: around here with 

337.32 340.09 B: the the main thing around here would be i think uh 

340.71 344.84 B: i don't know how could they uh taint the great lakes but that is uh 

344.48 345.07 A: uh-huh 

345.73 346.15 B: you know the 

345.96 346.61 A: that would be uh 

346.67 347.13 B: the most 

346.73 347.67 A: a big task 

347.58 353.51 B: yeah the most valuable resource around here not that we haven't done a good job of tainting ourselves 

354.18 358.96 B: but it is not that as bad as you envision as you picture in in places 

359.56 361.12 A: oh uh-huh 

360.37 364.76 B: michigan is is is beautiful actually believe it or not you might have a different 

365.50 367.54 B: i don't know if you've been to chicago or anything but 

367.63 370.18 A: no i haven't made it too far uh east 

369.97 372.84 B: yeah you when you are in the west coast i know -cause i used to 

373.03 374.36 B: i grew up in the west coast 

374.99 375.61 A: uh-huh 

375.62 375.95 B: so 

376.06 376.75 B: i know i know 

376.46 378.27 A: yeah my my dad was born in michigan 

378.33 380.05 B: uh yeah there you go 

379.88 380.30 A: so 

380.55 384.44 A: but i think his parents moved the family out when he was still a teenager 

380.61 380.97 B: really 

384.86 387.63 B: oh right so what are some other things that you could 

388.37 389.28 B: do that we should be 

390.68 391.37 B: concerned about 

391.67 393.19 B: -cussed anthrax we've dis- 

393.31 396.21 B: -cussed uh small nuclear devices maybe 

396.92 398.53 B: tainting water uh 

399.43 399.89 B: besides 

399.52 400.18 A: um 

400.59 401.91 A: i uh i i don't know i- 

402.61 404.16 A: you know i uh 

405.11 406.19 A: i i think i 

407.03 409.81 A: i think what has proved most effective at least in 

410.57 414.45 A: in the middle east has been you know suicide bombers and i 

414.37 414.83 B: right 

414.61 415.71 A: i wonder if 

415.93 418.14 A: you know could could they do uh you know 

418.23 419.72 A: a person delivered 

420.13 422.43 A: chemical or biological weapon 

424.03 424.51 B: i'm not 

424.24 425.34 A: you know would that be 

426.01 426.36 B: that 

426.47 428.81 B: you know i don't know what ki- kind of uh 

429.68 432.95 B: super uh chemical thing like that 

433.90 434.86 B: they could do 

435.30 436.31 A: yeah i i don't know 

436.41 444.68 B: i'm wondering that you know the uh the n._i._n._e. eleven was so you know so spectacularly done you know you can't really repeat that 

445.04 446.24 B: sort of thing now 

445.95 447.29 A: yeah yeah 

447.73 448.15 B: and 

448.62 449.96 B: may- maybe the 

450.47 452.65 B: the worst things that can be done 

453.15 459.80 B: would have to be you know de- developed by by uh you know cells in the united states 

460.28 462.52 B: and do they have access to this stuff 

462.90 463.44 B: but do we 

463.15 463.65 A: yeah 

463.76 467.60 B: but do we sit around and worry about it you know and not anymore i don't 

467.53 468.22 A: i i 

468.38 469.78 A: yeah i don't know that i ever 

470.11 473.29 A: that i ever have i mean even even after 

473.50 478.60 A: uh september eleventh and you know i never sat here and wondered are are we next 

478.40 478.99 B: right 

478.70 483.48 A: you know it was kind of you know mourning what happened but i've never been 

484.34 488.44 A: you know the one that looks forward and says oh my goodness what is going to happen 

487.04 487.86 B: no i never knew that 

488.56 494.80 B: i've never been that that (( )) that paranoid i mean except only on nine eleven when all of it happened at once 

494.44 497.06 A: yeah that that i mean it was kind of 

495.31 495.71 B: was 

497.90 498.44 A: yeah 

498.08 502.30 B: it's disconcerting to see the pentagon smoking and then to see 

502.79 503.18 B: you know the 

503.05 503.71 A: yeah 

504.48 509.97 B: the world trade center taken out and then the the airplane going down in p._a. and they've learned 

509.67 510.25 A: mhm 

510.32 512.70 B: that was headed for d._c. and now that 

512.89 516.32 B: once they pulled it all together though it was it was 

516.63 517.14 B: just had to 

517.96 521.04 B: to give the terrorists credit for pulling that off but 

520.78 522.16 A: yeah yeah 

522.45 525.14 B: the repeat likelihood of that occurring 

526.72 527.30 B: no 

526.96 528.69 A: yeah pretty well i'd say 

528.66 534.48 B: it's got to be something new and i'm not sitting around think- worrying about them uh sabotaging 

533.71 534.38 A: no 

535.36 536.22 B: you know major 

537.31 543.00 B: uh freeways or you know i don't know food supply water supply 

540.16 541.86 A: mhm yeah i i don't know 

544.17 546.54 A: yeah so many of those things seem so big 

547.24 547.65 A: that 

548.39 549.76 A: you know most untouchable 

551.70 552.73 A: alright i don't know 

553.14 554.55 B: me neither 

554.55 560.58 A: yeah it it is hard to imagine in the first place some one who would want to cause that much damage but uh i mean i guess we know that they are out there
