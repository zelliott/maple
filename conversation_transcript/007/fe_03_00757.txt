14.94 17.17 A: and and we're to talk about 

17.82 18.93 A: what would be a c- 

19.55 20.63 A: where do we draw the 

19.70 21.88 B: acceptable humor or 

22.06 23.08 A: okay 

23.17 24.23 A: um 

24.40 26.07 A: for me i like comedy 

26.57 29.15 A: because sometimes if i'm down i like to laugh 

29.72 31.43 A: but i draw the line 

32.15 32.99 A: when it comes to 

33.62 37.88 A: too much sex sexual information 

38.16 44.92 A: to me it's okay to mention a little bit but when they keep going on and on and on then 

45.86 47.37 A: i'm don't care for it 

47.54 50.65 A: yeah i mean if they're talking about like a stand up comic 

51.36 51.99 A: or so 

51.36 54.14 B: i kind of feel the same way you know and i don't like the sex 

52.78 53.81 A: yeah 

54.25 56.02 B: scenes in it you know and i think 

55.65 56.52 A: no 

56.82 58.85 B: comedy is comedy (( doesn't it )) 

58.46 58.89 A: (( )) 

59.21 59.87 A: yeah 

59.28 61.72 B: always have to you know it seems like everything is 

62.97 64.95 B: so sexual nowadays so 

68.69 71.03 A: there was comedy but it was like um 

71.19 72.53 A: jerry lewis 

72.76 81.24 A: i mean i remember them and dean martin i mean they could be funny and you didn't need all of this like bathroom humor and 

82.07 83.51 A: blah blah you know 

83.60 84.83 B: exactly yeah 

84.05 91.18 A: i i didn't you know i didn't need i didn't need it because some things are just or like carol burnett was funny 

91.49 91.82 B: yeah 

92.50 93.93 A: and you know they could just 

94.22 102.15 A: or um even like listen now like on at night i listen to the jack benny shows and i mean they're just funny 

102.83 104.75 B: oh i didn't realize that was still on 

104.44 108.99 A: uh-huh in like eh in our area it's on like at midnight 

109.45 110.50 B: oh yeah 

110.48 113.02 A: and and so that's good um 

113.20 115.85 A: but i do uh but um so i 

116.01 118.63 A: i draw the line at too much sexual 

119.06 121.58 A: or if it's racial or um 

122.13 122.61 B: yes 

123.36 126.94 A: you know 

127.18 127.56 B: well 

127.66 135.51 B: you know especially the stand-up comedians you know now we got the one gal she all she talks about she's a lesbian i can't think of her name 

130.72 131.50 A: mhm 

134.88 136.81 A: oh what i can't 

137.20 139.16 B: yeah that one that 

137.62 138.89 A: oh i don't know 

139.92 143.35 B: has short blond hair and you know she just goes on and 

142.60 143.79 A: hm 

143.91 148.06 A: i th- i know who you're talking about does she have her own show? 

143.92 144.81 B: there's a couple 

146.12 146.94 B: yeah 

148.34 149.70 A: no not ellen de-

149.98 152.74 B: yup yeah yeah ellen degeneres yeah 

150.82 151.42 A: yeah 

152.09 153.26 A: okay 

153.36 154.02 B: yeah 

154.21 154.57 B: so 

155.26 159.10 B: that's not even comedy and you know like all the black people they're 

159.77 160.96 B: you know they sit and 

159.82 160.58 A: mhm 

161.99 166.69 B: talk about white people you know that's not comedy and they swear and 

163.14 172.50 A: yeah i mean that's that's not comedy either oh yeah and i draw a line if they're cursing too much then it's like 

167.06 167.72 B: you know 

171.86 172.50 B: yeah 

172.64 174.31 A: hm i'm going to turn 

174.44 177.12 B: i don't think there's much comedy anymore 

176.82 178.20 A: no 

177.24 178.53 B: frankly you know 

178.65 179.71 A: now i like 

179.87 183.87 A: um silly now i always like to watch saturday night live 

184.58 184.89 A: because 

186.16 187.51 A: they're pretty good 

187.74 192.10 A: because they you know it's just to make you laugh but 

192.27 194.12 B: and the cosby is still on he's 

192.29 192.89 A: um 

193.65 197.60 A: yeah i that's like that or even like andy griffith 

194.27 196.13 B: he's comedy and he's good 

197.75 199.28 B: yeah andy griffith yeah 

198.29 202.00 A: yeah i mean sometimes you can learn through comedy 

202.36 202.97 B: yeah 

202.99 203.80 A: but um 

203.13 203.44 B: so 

204.71 206.83 A: i don't even think i would probably 

207.54 211.15 A: there wouldn't be anyone i would even say gee i'd like to go see 

211.58 213.28 B: yeah 

211.75 213.39 A: as a comedian or 

213.46 214.33 B: really 

213.84 219.01 A: you know i like sometimes i'm thankful for uh the t._v. that can um 

215.19 215.87 B: i know 

219.33 224.42 A: the regular channels before cable that can you know where they can't say everything 

225.26 225.64 A: but 

226.01 226.67 A: definitely 

227.03 235.20 A: the first even before racial things i think to me is always sexual because you know if they start with sex they're going to get to the other stuff and 

234.94 236.32 B: exactly yeah 

235.65 237.79 A: you know and then it's just 

238.14 240.31 A: you know if you knew how to be a comedian 

241.11 242.83 A: you don't need that to be funny 

243.52 244.83 B: no i agree 

243.62 244.31 A: you know 

245.11 245.88 A: because 

246.22 253.47 A: i grew up up with funny things and laughing and you didn't have to have that or you didn't have to say this word to be funny or 

254.39 255.55 A: you know this 

255.82 256.88 A: do this 

257.03 257.63 A: you know 

258.22 258.62 B: yup 

258.35 261.03 A: or make obscene gestures to be funny 

261.70 263.05 A: so like 

262.59 263.29 B: people are just 

263.44 266.00 B: mixed up i think in what they think is 

266.35 268.24 B: supposedly funny anymore 

267.87 268.91 A: mhm 

268.61 270.09 B: the ideas you know 

270.40 273.20 A: and that's true so like if i'm 

273.30 277.21 A: if i like if i'm watching t._v. and i see a comedy show 

277.65 279.25 A: well i'll listen for a little while 

279.44 280.10 B: yeah 

279.70 280.71 A: but then if they 

281.16 283.59 A: get to that point where it is something 

283.84 285.96 A: really going on long 

286.24 286.73 A: um 

286.83 289.92 A: that i don't like then i'll just turn the channel and say 

290.52 291.47 A: that's enough 

291.81 292.43 B: yeah 

293.18 295.46 A: then some i know consider it art or 

296.75 297.19 A: i don't 

298.85 301.02 B: yeah what part of the country are you from 

302.10 302.93 B: oh yeah 

303.04 303.53 B: yeah 

304.09 308.17 B: i'm from montana so 

306.32 309.28 A: oh 

309.01 312.91 B: so we're pretty really conservative i guess is the word 

310.40 311.29 A: are 

311.73 312.94 A: yeah i think 

313.08 314.48 A: yeah 

315.08 316.70 A: not like um 

317.01 318.71 A: my my son and 

318.92 323.20 A: they like comedy and they'll say like mom we have this comedy 

323.76 334.88 A: video and then i'll start and then i'll go like no i don't like this or it's just or it's too much foul language let's say they're not doing anything else wrong 

332.72 333.24 B: yeah 

335.32 340.35 A: but everything other word is like a curse word coming out of them then 

339.07 339.39 B: yeah 

340.90 344.55 A: i it's like i don't need to listen either anymore to it 

344.80 346.56 B: no i agree 

345.01 345.82 A: the comedy 

347.76 348.26 A: but i 

347.85 354.28 B: you know people set the pace and you know and pretty soon people just expect that out of comedy and so it's 

354.30 355.28 A: i know 

354.47 357.71 B: it's hard to change you know i think i don't know 

357.88 359.53 A: i just wish they had like 

360.00 362.33 A: grew up with who we thought was funny 

362.57 363.26 B: yeah 

362.60 373.70 A: which was really like andy griffith and um hee haw and and and lucille ball now see those were real people who knew comedy 

367.39 371.35 B: yeah hee haw yeah yeah 

373.91 374.54 B: yeah 

374.14 375.18 A: i mean they could just 

375.29 376.06 A: give a look 

376.71 379.67 A: and you would just you know bust out laughing 

380.04 381.26 B: i think you can tell 

381.46 384.62 B: you know jokes and stuff but i just don't 

382.85 384.11 A: yeah 

384.73 388.07 B: i don't think you need to always swear and i don't know why people think 

388.16 391.45 B: saying the f. word and all that is comedy you know 

388.24 388.72 A: that's 

389.47 390.67 A: yeah it's 

391.46 393.44 A: i don't either you know 

394.35 397.59 B: they think you've got to swear and degrade each other and 

396.89 398.61 A: mhm now 

398.10 398.89 B: for comedy 

399.02 403.46 A: yeah now did you did you ever watch the jerry seinfeld show 

403.67 404.14 B: oh 

404.29 405.43 B: yeah i did 

405.72 406.71 A: now at first 

406.24 407.26 B: for a while but 

408.18 410.38 B: he was kind of 

412.16 412.55 B: uh-huh 

415.14 415.45 A: fact 

416.10 418.07 A: then i was like uh this one isn't fun 

416.22 416.76 B: yeah 

418.71 422.02 A: but when there was just saying regular things and being normal 

422.61 424.85 A: then you know i thought they were pretty funny 

425.13 432.91 B: i don't know if the brady bunch is comedy but they're just so stupid that it's comedy to me 

428.38 435.53 A: i know see that's that's the kind of comedy i like with like the brady bunch 

435.67 437.46 A: or even the simpsons 

437.73 438.75 B: oh yeah 

438.49 441.99 A: i really think you know now he's really funny 

441.99 443.55 B: yeah

484.37 484.82 B: hm 

484.78 485.50 A: but 

485.83 490.13 A: i like it in a way because in the show you know how some things 

491.32 493.54 A: in some comedies we're afraid to 

494.52 500.89 A: touch on but in in one of the shows the child is in a a advanced classroom 

495.65 496.17 B: uh-huh 

501.19 503.05 A: and on of his best friends 

501.49 501.85 B: mhm 

503.19 505.43 A: is in a wheelchair and had asthma 

506.05 506.83 B: oh 

506.75 512.21 A: but the way they do the comedy it's not making fun of his asthma 

512.22 512.72 B: mhm 

512.91 516.27 A: but it's it's like he's a part of their like when they do bad 

516.51 518.62 A: y- not bad things but boy things 

518.62 519.13 B: yeah 

519.27 520.78 A: which end up being funny 

521.11 522.20 A: or getting in trouble 

524.13 525.39 A: it's funny because 

525.82 528.69 A: he's normal too you know so you can 

529.56 531.71 A: you don't have to have everybody be perfect 

531.87 532.67 A: physically 

533.49 535.30 A: you know to be involved in the humor 

535.58 536.88 B: yeah i understand

543.97 544.53 B: uh-huh 

548.70 549.31 A: but oh

549.68 556.02 A: yeah i know it comes on well i don't our t._v.'s aren't the same i for us it would be channel twelve or 

550.32 550.63 B: yeah
