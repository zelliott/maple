27.17 30.73 A: one thing that we were talking about was the way that it's so 

30.92 34.76 A: public schools are more and more controlled by like corporate interests 

34.98 39.62 A: um like i i remember when i was in high school we got free television 

40.08 41.55 A: if we watched channel one 

42.14 44.06 A: i don't know if you heard of that it is uh 

44.24 45.38 A: you know uh you 

45.63 55.86 A: you know there is a little news bit on it and then there is a whole bunch of commercials so it is like you know every day during a certain class you got to sit there and watch skittles commercials and all this and it's 

55.99 60.37 A: you know it is just crazy you know like that this is a part of what public education 

60.97 61.82 A: advertising 

61.77 63.48 B: they are not focusing on the academic 

65.38 66.74 A: no i don't either
