9.40 16.11 A: yeah mine too i'm not quite sure how how to start the discussion do you have any particular opinions 

15.83 18.81 B: well it's easy to just make it safer 

20.09 23.13 B: they should make some of the schools safer 

22.73 23.69 A: hm mhm 

23.33 25.44 B: because of what's happened in the past 

26.17 26.67 B: um 

26.90 28.15 B: my daughter went to a 

28.64 30.63 B: catholic high school so 

30.68 31.34 A: uh 

31.45 34.23 B: i'm not really i mean i went to public school 

34.34 35.20 B: but that was 

35.31 36.93 B: several years ago 

37.12 38.45 A: well 

38.55 42.50 A: were there any particular reasons i mean related to 

42.74 46.97 A: public schools in the nature of public schools that you chose to send your daughter to a catholic school 

47.19 47.68 A: (( )) 

47.48 48.18 B: um 

48.62 52.94 B: yes because our academics weren't as high in our local area 

53.23 53.82 A: hm mhm 

54.15 58.06 B: so that's why i chose to do a college prep cause i know she was going to go on to school 

58.14 58.87 A: right 

59.41 65.17 B: so i think they ne- need to look at that kind of stuff too but depending on what area you're in 

66.05 66.63 A: you know 

66.84 74.71 A: issues with public schools vary a lot from area to area i mean i went to a public school but i went to a public school in you know a 

71.95 72.39 B: hm mhm 

75.12 82.51 A: wealthy suburb of new york city so i mean the issues that i had with that school are probably very different from the issues that 

77.34 77.89 B: uh huh 

82.72 84.52 A: people in a lot of parts of the country 

84.58 85.29 B: right 

84.97 85.56 A: have 

85.70 86.30 B: right 

87.06 87.67 B: yes 

88.42 89.00 A: yeah 

88.42 92.61 B: so let's see what else can we talk about 

91.10 93.62 A: well i guess i mean 

94.38 96.54 A: i don't know just on the issue of 

96.81 98.55 A: different schools and 

98.90 99.42 B: hm mhm 

99.86 100.62 A: different uh 

102.34 108.49 A: areas where there are schools i guess to me it seems like i mean i i guess again i have 

109.15 113.46 A: had i had some serious issues with my high school but i think that 

113.71 121.14 A: maybe fixing schools in poorer areas and urban areas is maybe the most important priority if you're going to start fixing 

118.06 118.38 B: yeah 

121.72 123.15 A: you know i mean 

122.40 122.79 B: yeah 

123.37 127.09 A: because it's true that things can definitely go wrong in 

127.89 129.61 A: other schools but 

128.60 129.09 B: hm mhm 

129.76 131.61 A: i think it's schools in 

132.13 137.75 A: poorer areas in particular that have the most severe problems both you know safety wise and academic wise 

149.94 153.96 B: um they should have something where they um kind of 

154.33 155.80 B: show them a little bit more 

156.26 163.59 B: of of guidance of where to go you know as far as an adult cause a lot of them don't offer that 

159.31 160.07 A: hm mhm 

161.13 161.57 A: yeah 

163.54 168.97 A: right and a lot of kids don't you know really have parental figures to do that sort of thing for them 

164.06 164.44 B: they've 

167.48 168.25 B: right 

168.78 169.36 B: right 

169.96 172.36 B: yeah that's true in those kind of areas and 

172.98 173.48 B: um 

174.23 178.23 B: i'm from illinois so it's different in the midwest than it is 

178.40 179.16 B: you know like 

179.04 179.74 A: hm 

180.39 182.31 B: the east side or even 

182.41 183.11 B: you know 

182.64 183.42 A: that's true 

183.84 184.48 B: um 

184.70 185.54 B: california 

185.74 187.85 B: is a lot different too 

185.81 186.33 A: yeah 

187.05 190.79 A: i guess i don't really know what kind of issues there are with public schools in 

191.05 192.09 A: the midwest and 

195.10 201.47 B: upset because they can't get the funding for things that they want to improve on and i just think that it has to with the area 

202.17 204.60 B: that it's at and not necessarily 

205.16 205.80 B: um 

206.24 207.55 B: you know what they're teaching 

207.85 208.80 B: it it just it 

208.76 209.37 A: uh huh 

209.01 213.95 B: it has to do with the funding of the state and you know 

214.17 216.83 B: um what the schools has to offer and 

217.82 218.30 B: um 

230.35 230.86 A: yeah 

235.41 239.44 B: you know and uh safety in the school is one main issue that 

238.91 242.96 A: right that just wouldn't have occurred to you to think other than hm mhm 

240.94 241.77 B: right 

245.82 246.49 A: yeah 

249.35 250.99 B: that kind of problem or even 

251.34 252.21 B: you know drug 

252.43 259.04 B: drug problems and you know different things that go on where where they need to adjust those things too not just 

255.68 256.16 A: yeah 

259.14 259.93 B: academics 

260.18 262.63 A: right because i mean it is true that 

263.20 264.01 A: it you know 

264.29 265.31 A: as a kid 

266.57 270.22 A: school is where you're spending most of your day you know 

268.77 269.50 B: hm mhm 

269.92 272.43 B: they right and you're being guided by them 

271.33 271.93 A: it's 

272.65 276.69 B: and your parents at the same time so they should be you know 

274.72 275.25 A: right 

276.47 280.01 A: and i mean if you know if the school in- even if you have 

280.09 281.00 A: wonderful 

281.12 285.07 A: academics at your school if the environment just isn't 

286.44 288.50 A: conducive to you know 

288.57 289.11 B: hm mhm 

289.15 290.91 A: a good society then 

291.37 291.92 B: yeah 

292.11 292.66 B: th- that's 

293.06 294.16 B: that's an issue too 

294.84 295.90 B: that is um 

295.52 298.01 A: yeah but cause i mean it's 

298.57 302.87 A: the focus of school maybe is on learning but that's not the only thing that goes on there 

302.93 303.49 B: right 

303.88 304.23 B: right 

305.08 305.83 B: that's true 

306.65 307.42 B: true so 

309.50 310.44 B: but 

313.48 320.37 B: let's see what else can we say about the school system 

319.40 329.91 A: i don't know i mean you know both of my parents are teachers actually so yeah but my father my father actually teaches at a um a jewish school but my mother does 

321.92 324.00 B: oh 

327.93 328.51 B: uh huh 

330.33 334.00 A: she's a dance teacher but she does teach in in public schools 

334.28 336.03 A: and you know it's 

346.45 347.56 B: oh yes 

347.43 351.12 A: the sort of issues that you have i mean like my mother has talked about 

351.53 354.32 A: you know like the issue of um of tracking 

354.57 355.08 B: hm mhm 

354.58 355.31 A: in schools 

355.62 358.15 A: she's talked about the difference like 

365.74 369.03 A: maybe kids who are uh a little slower at learning or 

369.37 370.98 A: have some behavioral problems 

370.88 371.38 B: hm mhm 

372.08 373.19 A: and she says that 

374.32 376.69 A: cause my father is very much in favor of tracking 

377.63 380.78 A: but my mother you know a lot of people aren't nowadays 

381.17 382.07 B: oh (( )) 

381.61 382.10 A: and 

382.71 383.13 B: go ahead 

383.29 390.89 A: yeah and so my mother has said that um you know one argument that she sees uh against tracking is that 

391.05 402.58 A: when she teaches a class which is entirely kids with behavioral problems then it's much more difficult to deal with than if you teach a class with some kids who are like that but also some kids who are maybe more eager to learn 

396.82 397.36 B: hm mhm 

402.75 403.32 B: yes 

403.81 409.66 B: i know i have a um a good friend who is a teacher who's in an urban area that right now is 

410.16 414.16 B: um having difficulties with that and um 

414.53 417.11 B: she always talks about how 

417.71 418.73 B: you know that that 

419.25 424.55 B: she wishes that she could help them a little bit more um as far as guiding them 

424.81 429.05 B: through you know path she doesn't see them going any further than where they're at 

429.83 433.33 B: you know she there's no opportunities for them to um 

430.50 431.24 A: right 

434.34 434.69 B: to 

434.88 436.08 B: continue to 

436.19 437.84 B: grow you know they 

438.07 441.86 B: there's nobody at home they're they're the breadwinners even though they're in school 

442.05 444.61 B: they're they're breadwinners there's um 

443.12 443.85 A: yeah 

444.71 445.51 B: you know 

445.60 447.66 B: different things where they can't 

448.05 449.27 B: they they have children 

449.44 451.69 B: the the ninety percent has children 

451.84 455.13 B: girls in that high school are parents already 

455.81 457.62 B: you know i mean it's really really 

457.73 464.40 B: not very nice huh not a nice area it's it's it's you know so they don't really have anybody to follow 

458.97 460.49 A: i guess not no 

461.19 461.97 A: no 

465.40 465.87 B: you know 

465.49 467.44 A: i guess you know the reason why 

467.63 474.71 A: schooling and public schools in particular does seem like such an important issue to me and i mean you know i'm not normally that 

476.28 476.79 B: hm mhm 

482.16 489.56 A: the issue of public schools just seems so so much more important than a lot of issues because it sort of affects 

490.10 494.26 A: entire generations and where they'll be for you know they're 

491.57 492.44 B: yeah 

494.09 497.21 B: yes they don't have the opportunities there like i said 

496.43 500.84 A: right and like you know kids in a situation like at the school of your friend 

501.19 502.13 A: just 

503.51 504.97 A: don't have you know 

503.62 504.21 B: hm mhm 

505.16 507.42 A: it it's totally 

507.88 514.21 A: up to schools and the kind of education they get what kind of opportunities they will have in life 

512.64 513.09 B: right 

514.59 514.98 B: and (( )) 

515.35 524.00 B: that's why i think a lot of people choose to go to the private schools as they feel that there is it's a little bit more guidance as as far as um where 

524.28 525.60 B: they're leaving the children 

525.90 533.32 B: whereas the public schools they don't have that opportunity to do so because they're usually a larger school than the private schools
