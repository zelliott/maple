42.92 45.66 A: uh i guess uh not much as far as like 

45.78 48.80 A: public schools and i don't know how they are in arizona but uh 

49.20 53.97 A: i really enjoyed my time in in uh in public school um 

54.17 55.23 A: i've been in 

55.42 57.41 A: since you know i graduated high school 

57.59 58.62 A: uh here in utah 

59.03 63.05 A: i've been in the military and so i've met people from kind of all over the country 

63.48 66.43 A: and some even some people that were home schooled and 

66.55 69.31 A: i guess i never met too many people that went to private school but 

69.78 72.87 A: i think public school is so much better than like 

73.01 74.96 A: people that get home schooled and so 

75.59 76.14 A: um 

76.26 77.85 A: and then i guess i don't know 

78.50 90.39 B: yeah you know i uh the thing i (( )) the weird thing is now like i guess these days they are trying to do like uh you know give it's like uh (( )) 

90.67 92.72 B: basically so that you can do like 

94.45 99.01 B: basically kids get paid or the government pays the kids to go to private schools 

99.12 101.83 B: w- from the govern- with government money or whatever 

99.17 99.75 A: yeah 

101.41 101.93 A: yeah 

102.05 103.21 A: yeah the subsidizing 

102.10 103.09 B: but that is kind of 

104.29 106.78 B: right yeah what do you think about all (( of )) that 

107.31 109.30 A: um i think well 

109.80 115.90 A: (( )) i can see both sides of this issue -cause i have a lot of uh like i have an uncle and a couple of cousins that are teachers and so 

116.33 121.78 A: you know the teachers are kind of you know especially in utah they are underpaid and they don't have a lot of funding 

122.16 125.43 A: and so what will happen is when these credits come through 

125.78 133.28 A: what they would do is they take a- you know they figure out how much they pay per pupil in in you know in the public school system 

133.62 136.79 A: in the supposedly they'd give that money so the parents could 

137.14 140.09 A: you know use that money for like a private education so 

140.39 144.60 A: it is going to take it would take a lot of money from the public um schools 

145.12 151.17 A: but at the same time i think it would be a great way to hold some schools more accountable -cause i think there are some really 

151.56 153.63 A: great teachers in the public school 

154.10 155.11 A: uh system but 

155.38 157.93 A: kind of the way it's set up now with some of the unions 

158.23 164.97 A: there's some terrible teachers that won't ever teach but they can- you know they'll never lose their jobs because of the way that it's set up and so 

165.41 171.13 A: this way i think it it can make people a little more accountable uh to what they need to teach 

171.55 172.17 A: because if it 

172.31 175.51 A: in a sense becomes more of like uh private industry 

175.82 179.19 A: because the public schools are going to be competing against the private schools that 

179.73 181.77 A: you know it may force uh you know 

181.97 183.21 A: some improvements 

183.53 185.20 A: uh in and so 

186.83 191.66 A: personally i'm kind of for it uh i've got two kids you know they are pretty young right now one is 

191.88 193.11 A: three and one is one 

193.54 197.75 A: so but i mean i i think public schools are great and i plan on 

194.44 194.76 B: wow 

197.93 199.89 A: keeping -em in public schools at least 

200.30 200.74 A: i mean 

200.91 202.45 A: i think out in the west we are a little 

202.81 210.07 A: luckier than uh i mean if i was in a huge urban center like chicago or new york you know and (( )) like a really really bad public school 

207.91 208.44 B: mhm 

210.43 215.49 A: then you know i can understand why people would be you know more upset but i think out here in the west i think we have a little better 

216.06 216.69 A: system 

217.46 218.01 A: working 

218.48 221.35 B: definitely definitely i had uh a great time in 

221.51 223.04 B: public schools and 

224.01 225.26 B: i i don't know i think 

225.46 226.77 B: it's a great way to 

227.55 230.31 B: basically just keep the diversity like for me it's 

230.53 230.97 A: sure 

231.32 233.22 B: all about diversity and keeping 

233.52 235.05 B: everybod- well you know like 

235.54 236.43 B: i i kind of uh 

236.85 238.46 B: points i have thought about 

238.77 241.49 B: possibly like okay how would i have been if i was 

241.79 242.46 B: you know like (( )) 

242.89 245.88 B: in some catholic school or something like that (( )) 

244.72 246.78 A: sure 

246.56 249.46 B: but i really i really 

250.08 251.76 B: value my 

252.13 257.71 B: education and and my whole background and i think a lot of just that comes from so much even just 

258.15 261.80 B: the purely the academic you know it's it's more about 

262.77 264.58 B: who you bump into and and 

264.16 264.81 A: exactly 

265.39 266.56 B: yeah so i think 

266.76 267.95 B: for sure for me and for 

268.28 269.71 B: my kids if i ever have them 

269.85 270.30 B: i'd 

270.51 272.81 B: that's the way to go i think that 

272.93 278.88 B: this country is kind of built on everyone kind of getting together and you know like in that sense not really um 

280.56 283.27 B: i don't know i think if you separate everybody into their own little 

283.43 286.70 B: you know this is the catholic school this is the mormon school this is the 

286.11 286.60 A: yeah 

287.05 292.01 B: you know like pretty school it's like it's just going to turn into camps and people 

288.11 288.56 A: true 

291.67 292.07 A: yeah 

292.39 295.44 B: probably won't get along as well that's kind of my take 

294.23 294.64 A: yeah 

295.48 297.15 A: yeah um i agree i 

297.67 298.43 A: i (( )) same 

299.41 301.91 A: yeah i say i really agree the 

303.48 310.37 A: you know yeah i say the the diversity aspect was was really great uh as far as um where i was at 

309.88 310.91 B: you grew up in uh 

311.04 312.03 B: salt lake or 

311.98 315.89 A: um yeah i grew well the the town was called west jordan and it's 

316.34 319.29 A: for i guess as far as salt lake goes it's 

319.98 322.88 A: probably has one of the most diverse backgrounds as far as like 

323.24 324.11 A: we had you know 

324.36 327.16 A: quite a few ethnic groups represented and things like that so 

327.54 330.73 A: and it was it was good to bump into everyone because 

331.20 337.28 A: you know if like you just kind of (( )) say if you only stick with like your own group you only meet people that are just so similar to yourself 

337.71 338.38 A: you never 

339.35 340.66 A: you know you just never 

340.89 344.86 A: get an understanding that people are different and it's okay you know you don't 

344.49 344.96 B: mhm 

345.26 348.86 A: you know bump into people that had come from a completely different background that 

349.32 350.89 A: you know it doesn't really matter 

351.56 352.50 B: yeah and 

352.94 355.92 B: to branch out i mean really as a kid i think that's 

356.04 360.15 B: what your mind needs it needs the stimulus of the other of like um 

361.64 369.40 B: things that aren't the same you know it's like the reason why you are out there and the reason why they they make you go hang out with other kids and not be home schooled is to 

370.63 372.23 B: really to 

372.42 378.02 B: so that you learn life like that this isn't just a planet full of people exactly like you you know 

377.59 378.51 A: yeah 

378.81 379.32 B: yeah 

379.39 379.86 A: (( )) 

379.43 385.81 B: yeah it's a cool it's pretty interesting it's actually a pretty interesting topic that up in well 

386.06 388.25 B: i guess down here in arizona it's uh 

389.35 390.55 B: kind of a big issue because 

391.03 391.66 B: every time it 

391.87 396.75 B: up into the state legislature it's like there's always a a big 

397.30 398.43 B: conservative 

399.16 400.46 B: push for 

400.58 405.23 B: you know being able to have the whole what is the term for that it's um 

406.95 408.21 B: the type of schooling 

408.46 409.08 B: um 

410.00 411.92 B: you know what i'm talking about it's like um 

412.77 416.82 B: it's not home schooling it's not private schools but it's this this other term 

417.22 417.79 B: like um 

418.67 419.49 A: i'm not sure 

420.21 424.89 A: i know there's they've talked about the like so there's some privatization and there's some subsidi- 

425.39 426.59 A: like just subsidizing 

427.33 427.64 A: but 

428.74 429.78 A: i know there's some 

430.02 433.26 A: courses like that have been put together so that like uh 

433.38 434.77 A: it's like people that home school 

435.05 437.52 A: can actually get together and so they have more of uh 

438.21 439.17 A: you know it's 

439.60 443.46 A: i don't know it's not quite home schooling but it's not really anything else i don't know 

443.87 447.07 A: if if there's a term for it or not i've never heard of uh a term 

447.71 448.39 A: but uh 

448.13 452.76 B: well that's cool though the concept you are thinking of about is pretty cool -cause i know there are a lot of situations where 

453.43 458.81 B: families are moving or they are doing this or they are doing that and they have to home school so there is like uh 

460.55 461.61 B: a necessity for 

461.92 462.69 B: that type of 

463.36 464.50 B: outlook and and 

463.44 463.87 A: sure 

464.69 470.11 B: that kind of outreach too like to have a bunch of kids who are home schooled be able to get together and socialize is 

465.92 466.41 A: yeah 

470.23 471.54 B: is a great idea um 

472.76 473.56 B: not like a 

474.74 477.41 B: it's not that i'm hating on everything but i just think that 

479.30 482.76 B: in general i think our system you know works 

482.85 485.61 B: pretty damn well the way it does with with the public schools but 

483.77 484.23 A: yeah 

484.43 484.99 A: i agree 

486.71 487.63 A: that's at this 

488.39 489.20 A: there's uh 

489.43 494.78 A: i mean the problem that i see is like most of the people that i've met that home that home schooled their kids 

495.20 497.56 A: and you know not to pa- pass judgment but it's like 

497.93 501.01 A: they all they have is like a high school diploma 

501.42 503.73 A: and so i think that is really limiting 

504.20 506.35 A: you know your your kids 

506.91 507.56 A: life 

507.74 509.33 A: chances you know i mean 

509.84 511.51 A: i mean i think i'm pretty 

511.72 519.17 A: you know intelligent but i don't want my kids to be just as smart as me i mean i want them to go (( )) someone who has just got at least a masters or you know i mean 

519.49 522.39 A: someone who has really studied or specialized in that subject 

522.87 526.89 A: you know i just can't teach english math and science and everything 

522.96 523.42 B: right 

527.50 529.00 A: you know to my kids and 

529.41 533.47 A: not only that uh but (( )) just the social interaction 

533.77 536.50 A: because i was a scout master and uh 

536.67 539.27 A: in california for about a year and a half 

539.70 540.34 A: and 

539.71 540.30 B: that's cool 

540.65 541.14 A: uh 

541.45 542.77 A: and then there was this family that 

543.35 550.02 A: that showed up and they were brand new i mean i never heard of -em they just showed up and they had like three kids that were like in in the scout age and they showed up 

550.41 553.31 A: and it was so obvious that were home schooled they had 

553.65 556.00 A: no clue how to interact socially 

556.10 556.91 B: mhm 

557.36 558.24 A: it what's that
