28.41 28.91 A: um 

29.71 34.06 A: there there's so many things going wrong and a lot of it is not necessarily 

34.17 34.70 A: ah 

41.75 51.52 A: girlfriend works at and and and then the parents don't want any responsibility and that are just trying to pass it all off on the school or you know they don't have time to read to their kids and things like that 

51.58 52.05 B: yeah 

52.71 54.51 B: you know i i agree i've 

54.63 60.93 B: um i don't know if it's so much a a problem with actual school systems like you said you know 

60.70 61.10 A: yeah 

61.16 61.80 B: it's 

62.52 65.91 B: ah and people can do complain about the school systems and say 

66.30 71.37 B: oh blah blah blah you can't get a good education anymore but i don't i don't think that 

71.72 75.95 B: you know for the most i don't think that parents are really putting in their share of the work 

76.48 80.30 A: yeah and it's just it's you know my my parents are both retired 

80.42 82.02 A: ah teachers and like 

82.57 83.81 A: in lance you hear about 

84.11 90.22 A: when i was in like third grade you use to um go home for lunch you actually like an hour an hour and a half for lunch 

90.02 90.61 B: uh-huh 

90.81 95.11 A: so basically the parents would you know would would be forced to prepare a meal 

94.98 95.45 B: yeah 

95.22 97.33 A: and and at my girlfriends school 

97.72 103.18 A: you know the school you know they they provide the breakfast in in in some aspects it's needed because the kids 

103.73 104.13 A: you know the 

104.20 107.03 A: the families don't have that much money but on the other hand 

107.45 108.46 A: you know their ah 

108.65 110.29 A: it it it makes the 

110.56 111.07 A: the just 

111.29 113.12 A: more things for the school to do 

113.19 113.67 B: yeah 

113.98 114.90 A: and um 

115.12 118.89 A: i don't know it's it's it's kind of sad really because there's a you know 

119.17 120.42 A: and and the things like the kids 

120.52 131.13 A: (( )) ah er or have been taught to eat like there's really nothing healthy they serve at my girlfriend's school i mean they eat like hash browns and (( )) 

131.69 132.13 A: um 

132.22 133.99 A: intake so like they've got 

134.55 138.30 A: you know the kids get use to that and then they'll carry that out into you know adulthood 

138.29 138.96 B: uh-huh 

139.74 147.07 A: and then you have problems you know they never you know like you're going to have children with ah type two diabetes and all these other health problems and really the 

147.17 150.82 A: the public schools aren't really developing any kind of plan for for that 

151.01 151.54 B: yeah 

152.54 154.05 B: yeah i i don't know if i 

154.47 157.37 B: what i have a daughter and i hope that 

157.93 166.65 B: by the time she's of school age i hope to either be in a in an area where the school systems are really you know great i would 

166.87 171.31 B: if i have to the money i would love to put her in private schools but i don't know that that'll be an option 

172.05 177.21 A: yeah i i i i don't know what what really the solution is because here in lansing actually 

172.52 172.77 B: huh 

177.52 180.21 A: you know the private schools are suffering it's a lot like the cath- 

180.53 182.50 A: schools because the the lack of funding 

182.62 183.19 B: really 

183.35 188.81 A: yeah ah they're they're they're having to all sorts of revamping with the ah 

189.67 199.51 A: the the building and things like and the fundings just not there i mean i don't know if it's a result of the scandals that have been going on the catholic but i don't think people have been giving that much to the local 

199.88 200.42 A: ah 

200.63 202.11 A: the (( )) schools 

202.09 202.68 B: uh-huh 

203.37 204.25 A: but um 

215.18 216.61 A: better employment or 

216.96 217.57 B: uh-huh 

217.30 218.54 A: got it i don't know 

219.24 224.14 A: but but i think they're going to do some drastic changes after all these cuts come down on (( )) 

224.43 224.94 B: yeah 

225.23 225.81 A: yeah 

226.46 237.22 B: i i don't know i i hate it when you know they're when the government doing budgets and they decide to do budget cuts in education because i think that's where 

237.74 239.96 B: so many of the issues lye if everybody is 

240.17 241.71 B: better educated then 

241.91 244.96 B: other problems will kind of solve themselves too 

245.32 252.41 A: yeah now what about how's how's ah what's his name doing down there in detroit quamy kilpatrick with with schools down there 

252.58 255.29 A: because they they had to have like the state step in at one point didn't they 

255.34 257.16 B: yeah i you know i haven't 

257.72 265.08 B: paid a whole lot of attention to i actually haven't lived in michigan that long and sometimes the news makes me a little sad around here 

259.88 260.17 A: yeah 

264.56 265.93 A: yeah where where did you come from 

265.62 266.69 B: utah 

267.20 268.20 A: oh wow are 

267.97 268.55 B: so 

268.29 268.54 A: are you 

268.95 269.97 A: are are you a mormon 

269.87 270.91 B: i am actually 

271.02 272.85 A: oh my gosh that's a good thing 

272.07 272.69 B: yeah 

273.44 276.91 A: ah is it education is treated ah differently there isn't it just 

273.47 273.85 B: yeah 

276.83 277.39 B: you know 

277.12 277.49 A: (( )) 

277.90 282.57 B: um i think that parents um for the most part are 

283.45 286.94 B: more willing to help out with their with their children's education 

287.19 287.70 A: yeah 

287.80 292.59 B: family is a lot of a lot more of the mothers stay at home in utah 

292.75 293.19 A: yeah 

293.21 294.37 B: since say in michigan 

294.55 294.97 A: yeah 

294.94 299.24 B: and so they are there to help the children a lot more so 

299.30 305.67 A: yeah see i i ge- my major in in college was political science and i'd almost think you'd have to take 

306.22 314.02 A: like in in the cities where like the the people aren't very proactive with their kids you'd almost have to take i mean the money's going to force sense into but you but you'd almost have 

314.54 316.27 A: like the draconian method i mean 

316.54 319.26 A: actually put more responsibility on the parents 

319.20 319.79 B: yeah 

319.86 329.31 A: the superintendent here trying is basically doing the reverse of that i mean she's her ah the assistant superintendent like its its talked to the teachers and things like that 

329.47 332.40 A: and and said like it doesn't matter if the parents don't really 

332.83 337.39 A: do anything you know it's your job as a teacher so i mean so their throwing it back in the teacher's lap see like 

337.27 338.12 B: oh no 

338.22 340.51 A: yeah they place that you know basically they want them to play 

340.68 343.65 A: everything you know psychiatrist teacher everything 

341.79 342.32 B: uh-huh 

344.08 344.95 A: and eh in 

345.33 345.83 A: it's just 

345.96 348.25 A: i don't know it's a different value system 

348.32 349.33 B: yeah the the 

349.46 352.42 B: the children need more support then that i 

352.56 354.43 B: i disagree with that completely 

354.60 359.44 A: yeah i i there there used to be something developed i mean something like it's non 

359.91 362.83 A: you know i have nothing against religion but there has to be some kind of thing 

363.22 366.06 A: some what similar to religion that has to be 

366.85 369.71 A: like a uh some kind of mold or cast 

370.11 371.96 A: that you could apply i mean this is this 

372.20 375.70 A: this is the time especially in michigan their going to have to apply a new mold 

376.07 376.65 B: uh-huh 

376.27 376.64 A: this (( )) 

377.02 377.98 A: public education 

378.93 379.39 A: toilet 

380.24 380.78 B: huh 

380.57 380.90 A: um 

391.78 392.10 B: yeah 

393.01 394.09 A: public school setting 

394.25 394.80 B: yeah 

394.90 397.52 A: but their definitely has to be some sort of new 

397.94 398.88 A: foundation 

399.39 400.00 B: mhm 

405.70 411.48 A: uh my my girlfriend she's in like thirties and like a lot of the schools you have people in their fifties 

411.86 417.56 A: and there's like a lot of internal problems in the schools with a lot of different conflicting personalities 

417.60 418.22 B: uh-huh 

418.46 419.00 A: so 

419.13 425.60 A: again i don't wan to focus all on the outside but there are a lot of things going on internally in schools that are messed up as well 

425.79 426.64 B: you know i 

426.78 430.39 B: not that this is a public school but i was working at a preschool 

430.58 431.00 A: mhm 

430.68 431.96 B: a couple years back 

432.35 435.18 B: and it was it was a lutheran 

435.30 436.33 B: school 

436.58 436.99 A: mhm 

436.66 437.29 B: and 

438.33 442.58 B: yeah we were suppose to be teaching these christian values and yet 

443.67 445.71 B: some of the leaders there were like 

446.26 448.03 B: using the f. word in the hall ways 

448.25 450.14 B: when the children could hear that you know 

448.28 448.69 A: yeah 

450.37 452.35 B: so like there there were issues there 

450.41 450.98 A: oh yeah 

452.83 454.60 B: and i i don't know 

455.03 455.39 B: you don't 

455.09 455.55 A: yeah 

455.50 457.44 B: the children into those problems 

457.09 464.01 A: yeah i mean i'd be interested to that's the other things there's not much uh research done in the public schools or um 

464.52 469.00 A: straight progressive uh models put forward i think out east they've done like experiments 

469.44 471.93 A: with like separating the sexes and things like that 

472.04 472.64 B: uh-huh 

472.75 481.25 A: because there's actually been studies were like women are more assertive in math classes more participatory because like 

481.74 483.47 A: you know there's not that they don't feel like 

483.61 487.28 A: like the guys are looking down at them or poking fun at them 

487.92 488.47 A: um 

488.75 490.62 A: but i know there's been studies on that 

491.12 493.23 A: but that's the thing that sort of discouraged 

491.72 492.08 B: huh 

493.56 495.35 A: because you never hear any kind of 

496.39 497.73 A: you progressive 

506.46 510.14 A: pig research and thing but why don't they do things on what child research 

510.37 514.31 B: you know i have to tell you what in utah almost 

514.41 517.80 B: all of the the uh schools are 

518.16 522.63 B: going through different programs as far as testing out to see how that works 

519.90 520.27 A: mhm 

522.78 523.26 A: mhm 

523.28 523.91 B: and 

524.20 526.65 B: like in high schools our program was 

526.84 528.79 B: we got an hour lunch which 

528.91 532.36 B: before they weren't getting you know it was like a half hour lunch 

532.58 533.01 A: yeah 

533.04 537.51 B: so we were getting an hour for lunch and we got out at like noon on fridays 

537.88 541.57 B: just and and every school has something a little different and 

541.93 544.25 B: i thought it was really interesting because they were able to just 

544.47 546.55 B: you know do a lot of comparisons that way 

546.69 551.41 A: now in the high schools in utah they don't have pop machines like they do there i assume because 

552.20 554.44 A: as a mormon because you can't have caffeine right 

554.50 556.36 B: actually you know it's 

556.69 559.63 B: um it's recommended that you don't but 

559.64 560.04 A: mhm 

560.29 561.81 B: so many people do um 

561.97 563.38 B: they have pop machines there 

563.74 564.15 A: yeah 

564.03 565.11 B: but i 

565.28 568.52 A: so if you're a heart more of a heart line mormon you'd probably 

568.96 569.34 A: not 

569.59 570.63 A: like have caffeine 

570.57 574.80 B: yeah you have your diet coke rather then your coke 

574.34 579.41 A: okay so if you're like you know that that's probably among orange hatch and the guys 

579.59 580.61 B: yeah well 

579.60 580.02 A: the uh 

580.32 581.57 A: (( )) area 

581.76 582.28 B: yeah 

582.98 583.79 B: um 

585.53 586.11 A: but but 

585.53 586.97 B: it it's funny yeah 

587.11 597.07 B: but my little brothers that are in the high that same high school now they're having which i think this is great rather then just the pop machines they're having milk machines 

593.85 594.24 A: mhm 

597.59 598.35 A: oh really 

597.64 597.95 B: and there's
