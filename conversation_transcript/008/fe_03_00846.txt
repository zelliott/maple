0.23 1.80 A: my name is collette 

1.38 3.55 B: hi my name is sue 

3.50 8.89 A: um depends which best friend you're talking about [laughter] 

8.03 19.40 B: [laughter] that's true but you know if it were my i guess my total best friend that's what they're asking and i would probably turn down the money i think my friendship's more important than money [mn] 

19.20 30.34 A: yeah i do too um because money doesn't buy happiness or contentment or anything else of that nature that's more important than [mn] what money can buy [mn] 

29.99 34.92 B: that's true now going back to what you said it depends on which friend [mn] 

34.90 37.38 A: [laughter] true 

37.24 38.50 B: [laughter] 

37.88 44.02 A: um 'cause i have a few that are acting up and being bad right now [laughter] 

42.88 45.29 B: oh [laughter] so that would influence it 

44.54 53.72 A: [mn] y- mm slightly but um no if the truth be known i i wouldn't i i probably wouldn't do it either but um 

53.85 54.69 A: (( you know )) 

54.49 62.19 B: [mn] that would be pretty interesting well i'm not going to talk to you until i get the million dollars and then maybe i'll talk to you afterwards if you're good 

61.19 61.75 A: (( [mn] )) 

61.93 66.40 A: [laughter] yeah there you go you know and then you'll be then you'll be all right 

62.21 63.35 B: [laughter] 

66.43 67.52 B: right 

67.90 72.20 B: okay so now we have to think of something else to say about it right [laughter] 

67.90 68.59 A: (( oh )) 

71.52 73.62 A: i don't have a clue 

73.12 75.04 B: [laughter] 

74.11 79.02 A: i've been at this for two weeks every ti- every night at the same time [mn] 

78.41 79.71 B: oh really 

79.06 81.03 A: yeah [sigh] um 

80.21 84.80 B: oh well i'm sure you've had some pretty interesting topics [laughter] 

84.22 86.48 A: [laughter] ya 

86.00 90.18 B: [laughter] i was hoping they wouldn't give me a political topic 

90.12 93.11 A: oh no no they haven't done that yet 

92.75 99.29 B: [laughter] well that's good okay now let's see what else can we say about the subject ah 

94.07 95.41 A: (( [mn] [sigh] )) 

100.33 103.12 B: oh goodness that [sigh] 

104.49 106.37 B: [laughter] 

105.61 107.31 A: (( who knows [mn] )) 

106.39 112.75 B: let's think i mean actually it's kind of a cut and dried question in my opinion it is 

110.24 112.01 A: mhm 

112.22 113.37 A: right 

113.52 118.31 B: [cough] i guess you know you could look at it if you didn't have a best friend 

114.20 115.14 A: i can un- 

118.16 119.12 A: right 

118.36 125.39 B: or one that you considered a best friend because there are people who have [mn] many several different friends 

124.83 125.95 A: mhm 

126.24 127.42 B: so 

127.69 137.32 B: i don't know that would be a real i mean that would be a tough decision but i'd still go back to my original decision [mn] no matter what and probably pass that up 

134.02 135.01 A: yeah 

137.55 138.47 A: because i'm 

137.62 140.72 B: i'm thinking someone who is really hard up for money 

140.75 141.58 A: (( ahah )) 

141.01 145.46 B: not that [mn] i wouldn't like the money 'cause i would really like the money 

144.80 145.90 A: (( so )) 

145.54 148.29 B: but i think you know my friends have been 

148.72 154.14 B: um you know they've stuck they've stuck with me through a lot of things that 

154.29 155.13 B: um 

155.17 161.39 B: in some ways my family didn't and so i consider them closer than my family 

160.43 161.81 A: (( i wouldn't ever want to betray )) 

163.05 163.98 B: (( right )) 

164.02 165.18 A: (( them right )) 

164.28 167.29 B: that'd be pretty shallow thinking i think 

166.74 175.72 A: yeah yeah definitely i've only got one friend that that i had that i've had for over twenty years so ah 

174.90 177.96 B: [mn] you wouldn't want to waste it on that huh [laughter] 

177.12 178.15 A: (( no )) 

178.59 180.22 A: definitely not 

180.46 182.45 A: (( but ah you know )) 

181.51 191.50 B: well if they can you know sometimes friendships friendships come and go but if you've had a friend for that long i definitely wouldn't sacrifice what you have 

190.84 195.82 A: no definitely not even though we're two thousand miles away from each other but that's beside the point [mn] 

195.26 209.56 B: oh my well then you have a very strong friendship because distance [mn] can be [cough] a big deterrent on whether or not you continue with it in some cases i would say because i've had a couple of friends [lipsmack] 

196.72 197.42 A: [laughter] 

209.94 219.85 B: who i thought were really good friends and it'll be interesting 'cause one moved about a thousand miles away [mn] so we'll see you know how well we keep in touch 

215.48 217.34 A: mhm 

219.82 227.35 B: but um you know i guess i have to say that you you know i still want to but we aren't going to see each other as often 

227.19 229.76 A: right well email is a good thing 

228.56 229.47 B: (( [cough] )) 

230.11 231.35 B: mhm 

230.81 236.53 A: it it keeps you up to date but [mn] yeah we've known each other for seven twenty seven years [mn] 

236.21 237.56 B: oh my 

236.98 238.03 A: ya 

237.84 241.18 B: well then you've been through thick and thin with that person 

240.36 244.24 A: [laughter] long distance yes ah no 

243.25 248.95 B: have you ever had any arguments or been in [mn] squabbles or anything with your friend 

246.06 246.82 A: no 

247.27 249.42 A: (( nope no )) 

249.65 251.06 B: wow 

250.98 254.65 A: twenty seven years of peace she came down last year because ah 

254.74 264.32 A: they thought that i was gonna die i w- i was in the hospital for about six months so she came down to the [mn] you know to say her farewells 'cause she wanted to say them in 

264.46 265.67 A: in person 

265.56 269.64 B: wow that's true commitment to a friendship 

265.89 267.78 A: and ah so she ca- 

269.03 270.83 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

269.93 278.35 B: well here's a question for you you can sort of turn this question around and say what would your friend say and and be honest [laughter] 

277.52 281.70 A: ooh you're getting mean now [sigh] ah 

280.55 285.70 B: well not necessarily mean but it would be kind of interesting to think about their point of view 

285.39 290.41 A: yeah i don't think she would be willing to give me up at at any cost 

290.09 291.11 B: right 

291.03 292.13 A: (( 'cause ah )) 

291.38 299.45 B: actually if i i think about my three closest friends and all three of them w- would probably pass it up if they knew that they had to 

299.51 301.75 B: end the friendship over it 

301.11 303.05 A: mhm 

303.01 311.37 B: but you know what any person who would take the money over friendship they're not your true friend [laughter] 

308.45 310.02 A: (( that's right )) 

310.39 312.72 A: that was just joking when i said oh 

312.56 313.64 B: i know 

313.00 316.18 A: that i would have to think about that but anyway [sigh] 

316.62 326.19 A: 'cause you know i do have some friends that are behaving badly but i guess this is the first time i've been with this one friend for about [mn] 

320.66 321.53 B: (( do )) 

326.78 328.95 A: oh about six years 

329.02 336.24 A: and ah she just got mad at me for some goofy reason and she hasn't contacted me in over a month so 

336.05 342.11 B: you think she has the capability of of choosing between money and friendship 

342.54 344.05 A: (( mm )) 

343.11 348.76 B: you know actually taking the money part rather than friendship do you think she's shallow enough to 

349.57 350.63 B: go that 

350.54 356.62 A: well in the mood that she's in now i would say yes but under normal circumstances i would say no 

350.79 352.00 B: down that road 

356.43 360.82 B: [cough] so you're saying the anger could actually influence her decision 

360.03 361.84 A: mhm exactly 

361.18 363.57 B: would anger influence your decision 

362.74 364.23 A: no no 

364.27 371.03 B: okay now see there's a huge difference right there if you perceive her [mn] as think thinking that she might 

366.43 367.16 A: (( no )) 

371.71 376.89 B: choose over the money is sh- then the question comes up is she a true friend [laughter] 

376.67 380.18 A: well she has been but [mn] it just um 

380.33 381.39 A: i think 

381.60 385.72 A: my sickness has really taken a major toll [mn] 

385.73 388.81 A: on her and i think that she just needed space 

388.67 389.58 B: (( ahah )) 

388.86 392.19 A: so ah i think this is the way that she's acting out 

392.23 395.01 A: i'm not sure about that but that's what i think 

393.58 397.29 B: that's too bad have you talked about it 

395.37 396.06 A: (( [mn] )) 

397.34 406.52 A: ye- [mn] she doesn't want to talk about it and then when i ended up in the hospital back in in november it kind of forced the issue 

400.66 401.81 B: oh 

406.83 413.94 A: and so she's like i i i think that's what she did was she basically just wigged out because she really needed to ah 

414.02 419.73 A: see she she helped me move almost four hundred and and fifty miles 

419.42 420.60 B: wow 

420.54 424.34 A: to come back home and she's been with me continuously 

422.13 423.44 B: right 

424.47 429.90 B: well i wonder what what's wrong if she's not willing to talk to you that's i mean that's pretty 

424.73 425.78 A: and then 

429.77 434.51 A: well i'm bringing in another party tomorrow so ah 

433.60 434.61 B: (( ahah )) 

434.65 441.13 A: someone who's completely neutral that knows both of us very well and is completely [mn] 

439.01 440.25 B: (( yeah )) 

442.06 446.95 A: you know objective so i'm kind of looking forward to tomorrow afternoon 

447.31 451.85 A: so because it really bothers me you know when you don't talk to somebody for 

452.20 454.40 A: well it's been five weeks now 

454.12 457.42 B: oh sure if you're that close yeah 

455.84 464.80 A: yeah 'cause she was c- we were calling each other every day she'd come pick me up she'd you know [mn] you know do all that good stuff but [mn] anyway 

460.61 461.98 B: mhm 

465.81 467.36 A: [mn] well [sigh] 

466.51 467.77 B: (( you know )) 

467.82 476.34 A: so that's the challenges that we all face sometimes when we [mn] when we have a a long term you know illness so 

476.44 479.41 B: i forgot to ask you where are you what state 

478.25 480.26 A: i'm i'm in tennessee 

480.24 483.95 B: oh i knew you were in the south somewhere [laughter] 

482.93 484.56 A: how could you tell 

484.36 488.90 B: [laughter] well i think the southern accent is very nice 

488.25 493.21 A: [laughter] well believe it or not [mn] i wasn't born in the south 

492.59 494.67 B: oh you weren't

520.84 521.61 B: you know 

522.39 527.93 B: yeah well you know i just had a different twist on this question i'm thinking 

528.33 532.42 B: but now i can't remember what it was i was thinking something [mn] 

533.82 539.26 B: if we were oh gosh what was it it had to do with if we were given the money 

539.99 544.36 B: oh too bad they couldn't change the the question a little bit [laughter] 

543.67 546.59 A: yeah [mn] definitely 

545.92 548.72 B: you know if you had certain requirements 

548.98 550.83 B: to spend the money 

550.43 551.49 A: mhm 

550.89 556.04 B: um such as you know um i don't know maybe choosing 

556.42 561.73 B: ah you had to choose a certain amount of friends and then you could go to a certain place 

561.31 563.19 A: (( all right )) 

562.65 566.51 B: but i don't know i'm just making up things [laughter]
