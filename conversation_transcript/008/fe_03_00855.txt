128.52 129.64 B: that sounds interesting 

129.75 138.41 B: we have um this actually since i've moved to stillwater this is the most culturally diverse environment that i've ever been exposed to probably my entire life 

138.15 138.71 A: really 

138.74 142.70 B: yes i grew up in oklahoma and i'm from a small town called clairmore 

142.96 143.56 A: okay 

143.02 143.78 B: and 

144.16 144.93 B: i mean there was 

145.64 151.01 B: i remember the school system there they had lots i don't mean i was in all the (( )) classes they tested us when we were 

151.16 152.54 B: entering in to the second grade 

152.72 153.50 A: oh wow 

153.21 156.23 B: and they segregated us out from the curriculum

157.24 157.83 A: okay 

162.96 165.51 A: oh for like uh talented and gifted programs 

165.09 175.34 B: yeah like en- enrichment i think is what they called it and so two days a week for until we were in eighth grade we did that it was a lot of fun i really enjoyed it so 

166.86 167.31 A: mhm 

175.52 177.72 B: i enjoyed it i don't um 

178.14 178.90 B: probably 

179.53 182.86 B: i don't know i'm sure you've read the papers about all the teachers protesting down here (( in )) 

183.42 184.84 B: it is kind of it is kind of pretty bad 

184.90 187.22 A: actually i i hadn't seen anything about that 

186.91 188.34 B: no well 

188.82 192.39 B: i think we are like maybe the if not the lowest but the second lowest 

192.71 194.15 B: uh teacher's salary 

194.31 196.08 B: in the united states yeah 

194.33 195.00 A: really 

195.66 196.62 A: that is terrible 

196.51 198.28 B: and a lot of the problem is 

198.51 200.39 B: a lot of oklahoma is rural 

200.62 201.05 A: mhm 

200.70 206.66 B: it is really hard to get a quality teacher in a rural low paying you know 

206.38 207.05 A: yeah 

206.90 208.03 B: school district and so 

207.51 210.51 A: do they get do they get a lot of the teach for america teachers 

210.63 213.34 A: going out there or anything like that um 

211.22 212.53 B: oh what are that 

212.77 213.93 B: not not that i've heard 

214.11 216.51 A: there is a program for college students 

216.71 217.04 B: mhm 

222.60 225.16 A: low paid or troubled school districts so a lot of 

225.61 230.12 A: there are a lot of teachers in um in sort of the the new york city public schools and 

230.56 231.07 A: um 

231.64 232.38 A: a lot of them 

231.70 232.73 B: see i don- i mhm 

232.86 244.18 A: yeah so the the lower paying districts you know you you agree to take a job there for two years and then they pay for i think they pay for you to go to graduate school as long as you'll be a teacher or something like that 

239.20 239.65 B: wow 

244.10 244.50 B: really 

244.72 245.59 A: yeah so 

245.29 245.80 B: that is uh 

246.52 246.78 B: i'm 

246.98 251.16 B: i don't know i know about new york from what i've seen on television i've been to um lake placid 

251.31 251.91 A: okay 

252.29 255.11 B: and i've been to um new hartford 

255.32 256.20 A: new hartford 

256.10 257.25 B: and i've been to niagara 

257.38 258.71 A: okay 

257.56 258.12 B: and uh 

258.28 264.54 B: the only new york i've seen so all i know mhm mhm what i've seen on television and so to me 

259.95 261.13 A: so you you haven't been 

261.25 261.77 A: yeah 

263.36 264.45 A: upstate new york is 

264.61 268.14 A: quite different from um yes yeah it is um 

265.92 266.33 B: really 

268.50 269.89 A: it is much more rural 

270.13 270.47 B: mhm 

270.39 271.56 A: it is much um 

272.33 274.49 A: it is it is a different paced environment 

274.83 275.15 B: uh-huh 

274.98 275.25 A: so 

276.13 277.08 B: i just 

277.64 287.26 B: you know in my mind when you tell me that these teachers would agree to go to these other school districts it makes me think that they are like going to get shot or something or in danger of being shot on a daily basis that is just 

286.93 287.55 A: really 

287.58 288.54 B: yeah i'm serious that's 

288.70 292.38 B: i mean that is completely the impression that i have of what it would be like to go to school in new york 

292.56 296.04 B: -cause of what i see on television because that is all they ever portray 

300.28 300.62 B: mhm 

300.60 301.25 A: i mean that the 

301.42 304.66 A: the biggest problem he encounters is that you know a lot of the students 

304.78 307.02 A: don't get the help that they need at home 

307.32 310.24 A: um and they are they are not getting um 

310.52 316.20 A: they are not getting enough support from their parents you know and and the kids are poor and a lot of them don't speak english and 

313.28 313.61 B: mhm 

314.95 315.36 B: yeah 

316.82 317.24 A: you know 

317.80 321.32 B: that is pretty much the same the same way that is here except it is not that they 

321.43 324.46 B: don't speak english it is just that they are ignorant 

323.88 324.50 A: yeah 

324.70 325.35 B: and just don't 

333.53 338.12 B: numbers they are going to have to know or quarts in a gallon you know things like that seriously it is 

336.12 338.25 A: huh 

338.45 338.93 B: i mean it 

339.28 345.07 B: ignorance really does breed itself and it is very prolific and the rural areas out here especially 

341.52 342.31 A: troubling 

345.92 347.96 B: it is definitely interesting 

348.15 353.39 B: because this is an agricultural college out here it has got a huge veterinary program and things like that 

350.71 351.17 A: mhm 

353.78 354.29 A: okay 

353.84 354.78 B: to um 

354.93 356.64 B: like meet the incoming freshmen 

357.38 359.90 B: and i mean some of them are just people 

360.21 360.91 B: from 

361.09 361.38 B: just 

361.83 364.49 B: places i've never even heard of and i've lived here my entire life 

365.16 365.73 A: really 

365.37 366.57 B: and oh yeah and just 

366.70 368.52 B: all the misconceptions that they have and just 

368.75 369.42 B: they ignorant 

370.26 378.00 B: i mean just like me you know thinking that i would be horrified to go to new york city because i would be afraid i would be shot or mugged you know that is my ignorance 

376.43 376.78 A: yeah 

377.75 385.75 A: it is really nothing like that i mean new york is it's a really i i feel it's a really crowded city and and for that reason i could walk around it 

385.90 388.84 A: two three o'clock in the morning and feel completely safe 

388.91 389.44 B: really 

389.34 390.66 A: just because it's 

391.21 399.89 A: it's i mean it's very populated there are always people awake and you know as long as you stay out i mean there are there are some quieter maybe more dangerous areas but 

400.10 403.47 A: you don't go to those at night you know and and you learn your way around 

402.05 403.13 B: true yeah that is how it is here 

403.92 405.44 B: yeah we came from tulsa 

405.75 406.25 A: okay 

406.06 408.49 B: that is where we lived i love tulsa i really do 

408.69 410.13 A: hm i've never been there 

409.07 410.02 B: and i mean it had 

410.40 411.38 B: h- you've never been there 

411.17 412.21 A: no no 

411.76 412.65 B: have you heard of it at all 

412.77 420.52 A: no i i um i've heard of it but i mean i've i've only been to like oklahoma city and then i have an aunt who lives in i think ardmore is that right 

414.26 414.61 B: mhm 

420.33 421.76 B: right ardmore that is 

421.14 421.53 A: yeah 

422.09 423.61 B: kind of pretty down there once you get 

424.41 425.63 B: pretty town and all but 

426.37 427.09 B: it's um 

427.26 428.77 B: my great grandparents used to live down there 

428.99 429.64 A: oh really 

429.64 429.97 B: mhm 

430.07 430.77 A: yes yeah 

430.09 432.35 B: i have a great aunt some cousins that live down there too 

433.21 433.51 A: that is 

434.05 435.48 A: that is neat um 

436.38 440.03 A: yeah i think that the biggest problem with this school is just that they um 

440.88 443.21 A: a lot of people you know they don't want to pay higher taxes 

444.09 450.53 A: and so they are not willing to invest money in higher school like you know bigger school budgets 

450.67 451.18 A: um 

451.52 453.22 B: d- are the taxes pretty high there 

453.46 454.57 A: here they yeah 

453.73 455.51 B: i know property taxes are high 

455.30 458.17 A: property taxes are ridiculously high here 

457.88 459.15 B: and that pays for the schools 

459.23 459.85 A: yeah 

459.31 459.64 B: so 

460.10 462.79 B: and yeah i guess i can see why they wouldn't want them to be any higher 

462.87 466.04 A: there has been a couple of years when we we haven't um

468.21 468.80 B: really 

471.99 472.83 A: so um 

473.17 477.93 A: you know people are so disgruntled by how high their property taxes are and they don't realize that 

478.34 479.06 A: when you 

479.45 480.91 A: go against the school budget 

481.18 481.54 B: mhm

488.25 489.75 B: anything extracurricular
