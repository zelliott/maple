20.88 22.40 A: kind of broad and 

22.68 24.12 A: bizarre but um 

24.93 28.32 A: i guess if i had to go back and change anything 

28.90 30.40 A: i would have um 

31.45 33.82 A: taken high school most more seriously 

34.36 38.04 A: and i would have picked a different partner for marriage 

39.65 40.22 B: hm

48.12 49.35 B: oh 

54.65 55.58 A: think i settled 

56.91 61.95 A: i think i kept thinking well you know i can live with that i can live with that and then and

66.00 69.17 A: and i did end up graduating from college um

73.03 74.34 A: i didn't um 

75.29 80.48 A: take enough chemistry in high school and i didn't take enough algebra and um 

80.66 82.03 A: so it was like

98.27 98.93 A: oh did you 

98.68 99.99 B: so yeah 

100.36 102.65 B: so it didn't really hurt me because i didn't need any 

102.83 106.52 B: serious science courses like chemistry and physics and all that stuff 

106.58 107.14 A: right 

107.04 108.35 B: when i went to college but 

108.87 113.66 B: what do you i mean well when i remember uh being in that chemistry class in high school 

114.03 116.03 B: and it was it was a joke 

116.52 119.06 B: we memorized the (( )) chart and that was it 

119.08 123.90 A: oh really no mine was really hard and my teacher was real serious about it 

124.71 125.68 A: and it was 

124.95 126.64 B: you just didn't take it seriously 

126.97 133.62 A: uh yeah no i didn't um pretty much in high school i um dated a guy from sophomore year to senior year 

134.08 136.03 A: and i my 

136.56 138.63 A: you know biggest priority was my boyfriend 

139.37 141.39 A: and i was in a gifted program for gifted 

141.46 143.45 A: students until that time and then i just 

144.22 146.35 A: you know never took books home anymore and i just 

146.74 147.43 A: um 

147.60 151.61 A: barely you know i mean i graduated with a c. average but i could have done much better 

151.90 152.54 B: right 

152.93 154.03 A: and um 

153.33 153.83 B: right 

163.30 167.86 A: realized you know life is going to be really hard for me unless i go to college and you know get a degree

207.41 209.00 B: then i went to college 

209.51 212.00 B: and uh i kind of turned the tables a bit 

212.04 212.72 A: right 

212.64 214.14 B: and i got there and i thought 

214.28 216.37 B: you know i found a lot of other things that were 

216.52 218.14 B: more important than studying 

218.10 219.52 A: right you just did it you just 

218.62 219.95 B: and i did well my 

220.69 221.20 B: i'm sorry 

221.42 222.86 A: i said we just did it backwards 

223.08 226.02 B: yeah and excuse me so when i 

223.65 224.10 A: yeah 

226.47 227.95 B: during my freshman year 

228.30 229.00 B: i did 

229.28 231.87 B: fairly well but i didn't take that many courses i took 

232.06 233.75 B: you know a couple electives and i took 

234.32 235.53 B: maybe two uh 

236.22 239.07 B: it was english and math or something my first year 

239.20 239.70 A: uh-huh 

239.56 241.03 B: and then i didn't take anymore

242.58 245.86 B: any academic serious academic courses that semes- 

246.68 249.75 B: and then from that point of on it was kind of a downhill

262.64 264.36 B: so yeah i i um 

264.47 265.60 B: i did finish 

266.61 268.69 B: -cause because in my family it was kind of a 

269.62 274.29 B: thing where education was really really really important my father didn't finish high school 

272.45 272.99 A: right

284.14 285.27 B: very very important 

285.16 288.93 A: now see my parents couldn't really have cared less my dad would have been happy if we would have just 

289.35 291.11 A: turned eighteen and married anybody 

291.32 298.45 A: yeah my dad was enlisted military and they did not push school i mean my parents never asked to see my report card

299.52 300.51 A: they yeah 

301.15 304.92 A: they just really didn't push it they were going to be happy if we both got through high school 

305.60 306.81 A: and we both ended up 

305.77 307.27 B: do you have other siblings 

318.46 319.01 B: mhm 

319.92 320.45 A: so 

320.80 323.87 B: that is interesting though so are your parents college graduates

338.58 339.15 B: mhm 

339.39 339.82 A: so 

339.74 342.67 B: but that is a and that is a good stable job 

342.64 343.64 A: yeah it is 

342.81 344.12 B: that pays fairly well 

344.77 347.30 A: so what about other than your job what else 

347.56 348.47 A: would you change 

348.74 349.65 B: well 

348.78 350.81 A: i mean other than you are not taking um 

351.60 352.54 A: college seriously 

353.26 354.37 B: well i guess 

354.69 357.61 B: the other thing too that i would change would be 

359.12 360.52 B: when i was in high school 

360.80 362.74 B: i ended up i am um 

363.16 364.86 B: in to the arts music and

369.85 371.26 B: a an arts school 

372.44 374.78 B: and i went there for 

375.68 378.79 B: i guess about three or four weeks and i decided it wasn't for me 

378.84 379.29 A: mhm 

379.71 385.06 B: and if i had to do it over again i would have gone back to that school and finished because 

384.53 385.19 A: yeah 

385.64 391.25 B: it was really i feel like musically and well academically it would have made me stronger in college because 

390.84 391.35 A: mhm 

391.74 393.21 B: not only was it strong 

393.48 395.33 B: in ter- artistically in terms of 

395.87 400.61 B: and musically and you know in in the arts but it was also a strong academics school 

400.70 403.44 A: mhm yeah you sound you're you sound very smart 

401.30 402.26 B: they turned out a l- 

404.39 404.81 B: well 

404.41 406.02 A: you can tell that you are real intelligent 

406.59 411.25 B: thank you you do too and i was going to say that that i really um 

408.20 408.71 A: thank you 

411.89 416.40 B: i had some good teachers there i mean we had teachers there who and this this was in high school

427.00 429.45 B: math teacher who taught on on the college level 

429.76 433.67 B: most of the the teachers there were very serious about their work i mean 
429.79 430.30 A: mhm 

433.23 434.46 A: right right 

433.97 438.30 B: then we had people who worked with who have sang sung with the new york city opera and

442.22 443.23 B: unique setting

445.52 447.65 B: instructors you would normally get in college 

447.60 448.14 A: yeah

452.52 454.16 B: that caliber of instruction 

454.21 455.16 A: right right 

455.09 457.80 B: but um i feel like i was crazy to leave it and 

457.91 462.08 B: i mean i don't think i suffered as a result of it but i think there are some things i would 

462.46 463.99 B: be doing musically
