57.40 60.55 B: in in hindsight you know now that i'm i'm well i'm thirty how old are you 

61.07 61.68 A: i'm eigh- 

61.89 63.15 A: teen i'm just out of high school 

63.34 64.02 B: oh okay 

64.28 68.19 B: yeah so i mean in hindsight i mean you don't really have the the benefit of hindsight i guess but 

68.71 70.96 B: when you get a little bit older i i i think um 

71.78 72.58 B: you realize 

72.69 73.87 B: how how different 

74.26 77.94 B: somebody you know a little bit younger you know in in their teens i guess thinks and 

78.80 82.47 B: priorities change and stuff like that and i was amazed i went to my ten year reunion 

83.08 87.81 B: and i was amazed by how normal people were i i remember being in high school and everybody was very um 

88.52 90.58 B: cliqueish you know everybody hung around in their groups 

90.74 91.16 A: yeah 

91.54 94.25 B: you know you had the the -ad the athletes and the smart 

94.36 95.30 B: people and the 

95.57 96.01 B: you know 

96.33 97.93 B: the popular girls and whatever else 

98.63 100.85 B: and everybody was really normal at the uh 

101.74 103.41 B: at the reunion matter of fact they're 

103.53 105.29 B: regular everyday normal people 

106.01 109.69 B: and then if i would have met them today i would have been good friends with them but because 

110.38 111.84 B: of the way things were back then 

112.60 113.75 B: it was different i don't know 

115.22 115.68 B: so 

115.44 115.93 A: yeah i 

116.08 117.28 A: i guess what i think 

117.62 118.44 A: in high school 

118.69 120.25 A: and in particular i would change the fact 

120.49 121.43 A: i i never 

121.97 123.18 A: stood out i was always just 

124.14 125.64 A: there and made people happy you know 

126.18 128.77 A: and not that that's a bad thing i didn't have any enemies or anything but i think 

128.99 131.84 A: a lot of my relations were insincere just because i didn't 

132.37 135.68 A: really feel like you need to get personal with them i just wanted to be their friend you know 

136.20 136.51 B: right 

137.51 138.38 B: but i- it's 

138.53 139.38 B: it's part of that 

139.51 144.03 B: their fault to you think i mean is it is it something you think you could have changed by going back in time 

145.11 145.79 A: uh 

146.21 146.83 A: i don't know 

146.94 148.47 A: it wouldn't be all mine like 

148.76 151.44 A: i could try to like be different or honest or 

152.06 155.92 A: or anything but they would definitely have to partake you know i mean it i mean it's a two way street 

156.90 157.25 A: but 

157.26 157.57 B: yeah 

159.12 162.16 A: i don't know i always thought i i was better off not having enemies just 

162.72 163.09 B: yeah 

162.75 164.78 A: be complacent and everything but i think now 

165.25 166.23 A: no i've i've been out of 

166.93 168.49 A: high school for a year now 

168.93 169.31 B: yeah 

169.17 170.50 A: i can't i can't really 

170.63 172.57 A: talk with a lot of experience but 

172.58 172.87 B: right 

173.94 175.97 A: think that's one of the things that i would say at least 

176.51 177.66 A: i think that would help me now 

176.88 177.18 B: right 

180.17 181.59 B: yeah i i- it was 

181.90 184.67 B: i i don't know i mean thinking about going back in time if if 

185.12 188.23 B: if we were if anybody i guess was to go back to high school i mean 

188.32 188.78 B: would 

189.90 194.62 B: i mean not that i i didn't have any enemies either but i could have certainly have been nicer to people or acknowledged 

194.75 196.41 B: people or whatever but 

196.64 197.89 B: you know would would really 

199.80 200.13 B: would 

200.58 202.15 B: acting differently toward them 

202.95 203.51 B: would that 

204.03 206.23 B: change how people would react towards me i don't know 

206.41 212.07 B: i mean you you'd still be dealing with the same shallow people and the same cliques and stuff like that so 

213.00 216.64 B: would what i did really affect things in the big picture i guess 

217.72 220.79 B: besides making me feel better 

220.59 222.22 A: yeah we- but that does make sense 

223.66 224.62 A: that makes sense a lot 

225.09 225.43 B: yeah 

225.24 227.53 A: i mean i don- i don't i don't sit at night and dwell on on 

228.20 229.79 A: this topic actually 

229.52 230.93 B: no of course not 

231.65 232.88 B: no 

233.15 233.71 B: um 

234.38 236.71 B: i don't know what about anything else like outside of high school 

236.85 238.30 B: is there anything else that i mean it w- 

239.42 240.35 B: maybe um 

240.75 242.95 B: maybe it wasn't something that you've done maybe there was something 

243.62 247.39 B: what would you do at like if there was anyway that you could go back and change history or something like that 

248.94 249.99 A: oh man 

250.57 251.56 B: i have no idea either 

252.45 253.59 A: yeah i don- i don't know like 

254.07 255.99 A: if i'd want to change history because then you'd like 

256.26 256.56 A: -cause 

256.71 258.76 A: if i went back and maybe changed one thing 

259.15 261.85 A: then who's to say that wouldn't change everything now 

259.32 259.76 B: right 

262.08 263.46 B: right exactly 

263.76 264.21 A: i think 

264.68 266.64 A: another personal thing that i would've 

267.11 268.71 A: liked to do and i think i'm working on now is 

269.37 273.41 A: is i've been i've grown up in the church my family has grown up in the church and i i know where i 

273.87 274.90 A: stand on the issue 

275.35 276.43 A: of moral 

276.67 277.46 A: or morality 

276.99 277.41 B: right 

277.92 278.43 B: right 

277.98 280.58 A: and i think in high school (( and the other side of )) high school a little bit but 

281.44 284.88 A: during those four years of my maturity i kind of like neglected my beliefs 

285.74 286.69 A: a lot of people got 

287.40 287.81 A: this 

287.91 291.02 A: this idea that i was just a cool person i don't think anyone got 

291.27 293.93 A: me as a religious person and i think i feel bad because that's because 

294.46 295.88 A: i think i could have been more 

296.82 298.33 A: as a witness to my god 

298.58 300.15 A: if i would have stood out more you know 

300.21 301.21 B: r- right 

301.86 302.41 B: yeah i 

303.24 303.78 B: um 

304.31 311.56 B: yeah i don't i don't consider myself a particularly religious person but i consider myself moral i guess and i i try to live my life the best i can 

311.85 312.29 B: um 

313.14 313.54 B: but 

313.73 315.80 B: i i i think you're right i think people 

316.36 320.35 B: i think a lot of people kind of get lost here and there in their lives and kind of lose sight of 

321.15 321.67 B: of 

322.16 324.58 B: you know the high road or the or the better way to do things 

325.60 326.03 A: yeah 

326.08 329.01 B: but but i i mean uh as far as 

329.20 331.86 B: going back in time and changing as specific as that i 

331.97 334.95 B: couldn't tell you i suppose that i could have been nicer to so and so or 

336.17 337.69 B: you know or not said something but 

338.80 340.93 B: i don't know hindsight is twenty twenty i guess 

341.89 343.90 A: it's kind of funny how all i the the 

344.41 347.04 A: things you brought up is all about us treating people better 

347.59 347.99 B: yeah 

348.42 349.43 B: yeah that is interesting 

349.53 350.73 B: i never really thought about that 

351.76 352.93 B: so i mean i i guess 

353.60 354.05 B: i mean 

355.53 360.68 B: but who would i mean who really in their right mind would go back and say gosh i wish i would have punched that guy in the nose 

361.91 362.45 A: yeah 

362.60 363.48 A: that's true 

364.62 367.26 A: there's not many thoughts of that passing but i'm i'm wondering 

367.54 368.39 A: if i could have done 

368.87 369.15 A: if 

369.66 370.57 A: me acting 

370.68 373.44 A: towards the other person is the only way my life could be better now 

373.95 374.31 B: yeah 

373.99 375.90 A: does that make sense like is there anything i could have done 

376.52 378.97 A: for myself that would have made my life better and i don't think there is 

385.11 387.46 B: i- of time or whatever and something else or 

389.38 390.55 B: you mean the 

389.71 390.78 A: yeah tha- that's true 

391.61 393.07 B: i mean uh is that what you meant or wh- 

391.68 392.55 A: but i'm 

393.30 394.62 A: yeah that's what i i was i was 

394.75 395.56 A: making the p- 

397.86 401.97 A: the first thing that we both the first thing we both thought of to make our life better now would be 

397.98 398.86 B: oops still there 

402.06 404.11 A: our relationship with people back then 

404.46 405.48 B: yeah exactly 

406.22 406.48 B: huh 

408.17 408.96 B: it's interesting 

409.81 412.63 B: what about uh making things better for somebody else i mean is there 

413.58 419.21 B: i can't i can't really think of really anything off the top of my head that i had an opportunity to do something for somebody else and i didn't 

420.37 421.99 B: you know where i said oh gosh i wish i would have 

422.35 423.92 B: you know helped my mom on something or 

425.62 426.23 B: you know what i mean 

426.65 427.11 A: right 

427.00 430.26 B: but i i can't think of really any instances where somebody has said 

430.73 433.67 B: or has has needed my help and i haven't given it to them 

435.30 435.67 A: yeah 

436.33 437.53 A: or yeah same here in fact 

437.67 439.03 A: if i was at all possible to 

439.46 441.21 A: to provide my help 

441.92 443.06 A: then i would i would do so 

443.49 443.83 B: yeah 

444.84 446.05 B: i mean it would kind of i mean 

446.30 448.81 B: the things that we're talking about are kind of selfish in a way 

449.73 450.51 B: you know we we're 

450.74 454.07 B: we're doing things we're going back to make things better for ourselves not of somebody else 

454.77 456.65 B: and i wonder why that is is it -cause um 

458.38 459.45 B: is it because that we're not 

459.63 460.51 B: selfish people 

462.09 463.46 B: or you know what i mean is it 

463.65 465.11 A: yeah that that makes sense i kn- i 

465.33 466.51 B: i- -cause we have lived 

465.66 466.52 A: interesting point 

466.98 467.50 B: we have 

467.78 470.95 B: well the things we've done we've done unselfishly for others or 

472.17 472.57 B: i um 

472.88 474.56 B: just been good friends all around or 

475.80 476.09 B: huh 

477.22 477.92 B: very interesting 

478.54 479.36 A: yeah i don't know 

480.11 482.77 B: you know originally i was concerned that we wouldn't be able to fill ten minutes 

483.38 483.84 A: right 

483.39 483.96 B: with uh 

484.34 486.90 B: with conversation on time travel 

487.45 490.03 B: it's pretty fascinating at when it comes down to it 

492.02 492.36 B: so 

493.03 493.81 B: well where are you from 

493.22 493.76 A: trying to 

494.23 494.68 A: what 

494.94 495.53 B: where are you from 

495.95 497.53 A: i'm from north texas 

498.04 500.04 B: okay i'm from uh detroit michigan 

500.70 501.13 A: wow 

501.48 501.93 B: very cool 

501.76 503.57 A: kind of crazy that this little this little uh 

503.91 505.30 A: clinic or whatever this is this 

505.90 506.44 A: test 

506.78 508.76 A: puts uh random people in such 

509.04 509.69 A: close proximity 

510.35 510.72 B: right 

511.53 512.29 B: i mean it 

513.19 515.15 B: the i i mean i don't know 

515.33 518.84 B: i i was just trying to figure out i mean is there is there a way to change 

519.82 527.96 B: on a theory to go back in time is there not only for yourselves or people that you know is there some- is there something that you could have done for somebody that you don't know or make 

528.35 532.71 B: you know a contribution to the to the bigger picture like humanity or something like that 

534.19 535.78 B: you know as a younger person 

535.94 536.53 B: i don't know e- 

536.28 536.73 A: yeah 

539.55 540.12 B: or is that 

540.87 541.84 B: or does that go back to 

542.15 545.63 B: being selfish again that we'd rather do something for ourselves 

546.82 548.04 A: yeah i i don't know 

549.90 554.03 B: hm what about what about family stuff is there something that you would go back and change 

554.74 556.86 B: like relationships in your family or 

557.14 558.04 A: i don't kn- well 

557.29 558.55 B: the way things have worked out or 

558.97 559.63 A: i think 

559.88 563.16 A: the way my family has worked out in the past couple years has been 

563.37 563.95 A: great like 

564.08 565.33 A: i have three brothers and 

565.48 567.13 A: our relationship has been kind of rocky
