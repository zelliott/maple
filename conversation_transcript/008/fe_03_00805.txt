284.28 285.02 A: yeah 

284.95 285.68 B: and it's really

287.29 289.89 B: in life with nobody to be there 

290.84 295.16 B: so i'm kind of glad that i have somebody that no matter what they will be there for me

305.27 306.46 B: a manager so 

307.37 307.63 B: he's 

307.86 309.97 B: a little more important than me but 

309.60 310.35 A: oh 

311.61 317.83 B: and uh his job usually takes presence over mine but he gets paid more but i'm being to keep catch up with him 

317.26 319.76 A: oh -cause (( )) 

319.34 325.65 B: well i get incentives raises and stuff like that and he he has first gotten a raised when he got a supervisor and he didn't 

325.84 327.09 A: oh 

326.49 330.11 B: and he's been after his boss for over a year to get it and he 

330.34 334.95 B: they keep coming up with a reason why he can't so he he'll either get in trouble or something to where he can't and 

335.91 336.99 B: he gets kind of upset 

337.21 339.00 A: of course that's not cool
