0.32 1.74 A: [lipsmack] hi 

0.64 2.52 B: hi this is karen 

2.60 5.37 A: i'm sarah i'm from ohio [mn] 

4.62 6.49 B: oh i am too how're you 

5.87 10.02 A: oh good good [mn] so do you watch reality shows [laughter] 

9.38 13.61 B: not really actually i find them sort of stupid [laughter] how about you 

12.95 19.74 A: [laughter] i watch like i like the survivor one and i like i used to like amazing race but the new ones are scary [laughter] 

19.17 26.72 B: yeah i i got my family surprisingly i've got two teenage daughters and my husband have gotten into um 

26.86 38.67 B: joe millionaire so i was sort of forced to watch the last couple of episodes of that and [mn] um i mean a little bit of american idol but other than that i usually walk out of the room [mn] when they're watching that 

28.05 28.85 A: (( ahah )) 

29.29 29.97 A: [mn] 

36.89 48.36 A: yeah [laughter] like i saw a little bit of joe millionaire but like that new ones that are on now like the are you hot and [mn] um what's the one where pe- ah m- married by america 

48.21 49.57 B: oh yeah that 

49.03 52.62 A: that's so s- like unbelievable [laughter] 

51.24 57.45 B: i- it's so unreal i can't believe that they're even promoting it as reality t._v. and 

57.05 58.94 A: i know i know 

57.79 58.73 B: it it 

58.77 62.73 B: but apparently they're drawing in a lot of people so i'm not sure what the ah 

62.89 65.20 B: big draw is for people 

64.86 78.16 A: i know like i ca- like i that's i i draw the line there like even i don't know i used to when it first came out i watched fear factor a little bit [mn] but now some of the things they do i'll just be flipping through and i'll see it and it's like it's wrong i think to do that to human beings even 

77.75 85.62 B: [mn] well i think it sort of goes back to that show jackass you know where people think that you know oh this is cool and i'm going to try it and end up getting hurt or 

81.11 82.54 A: oh my goodness 

85.79 86.78 A: right 

86.13 87.99 B: [mn] yeah so 

87.14 89.36 A: right it's not even healthy [laughter] 

88.56 101.57 B: no no and it just you know i i really would like to see the demographics of who are watching it i am afraid it's going to be a lot of teenagers and [mn] you know people in their early teens and just really give them a warped sense of what the real world is all about 

96.80 97.54 A: (( ex- )) 

100.95 110.54 A: people who can't handle it basically and and it's for the future generations it's going to be more and more unhealthy then because i mean now that they've gone this far like where are they going to go with it it's 

102.58 104.00 B: yeah 

109.80 110.36 B: [mn] 

110.22 118.27 B: well it just gives them a totally warped sense of reality i mean here they're glorifying people who can't you know make get into relationships on their own 

118.17 119.53 A: right 

118.17 129.80 B: [mn] or or can't you know be successful in in a normal you know way and so all of a sudden we're making them into t._v. stars and you know heroes and oh i just think yeah i find it very disturbing 

125.84 127.11 A: right 

129.51 132.94 A: like that's an okay way to get a relationship started or something 

132.44 136.65 B: [mn] oh yeah and they're going to marry somebody sight unseen um just because you know 

135.08 136.61 A: oh i know 

136.71 138.74 B: america thinks they should 

138.51 149.80 A: right [mn] i mean i know that there are e- there's like the russian brides that people phone up for and stuff but this is even worse like they bring people onto it to vote on it and all that [mn] i don't know it is a bit bit odd [mn] 

148.79 158.24 B: well at least with the russian brides or the filipino brides you can understand that these people are trying to get out of you know horrible economic situation to say the least [mn] and you know so 

153.22 154.62 A: right 

158.11 167.32 B: you can maybe understand why they're doing it but you know supposedly these people are you know have careers and you know are are somewhat normal and yet you know they can't [mn] 

163.58 164.62 A: right 

165.69 167.71 A: supposedly [laughter] 

167.36 171.05 B: can't make it work so i i'm i'm really disturbed by the whole thing 

170.56 182.70 A: right they're supposed to be these great catches yet they're on t- like they try to build them up and oh they're this and this but they can't find a date [laughter] okay that's great [mn] and it's also i mean the like you say like the russian or the filipino they're doing it for a reason 

176.21 177.38 B: (( yeah )) 

178.13 178.94 B: well 

182.31 183.40 B: mhm 

182.56 188.39 A: but these people are it's purely for ratings like they're they're doing it for money and for the the t._v. ratings 

187.58 200.23 B: [mn] well and just you know and the additional media hype i mean all the stuff that came out of ah joe millionaire it was on the news it seemed like every day [mn] oh look what we found out about sarah and look what we found out about ethan or whatever his name is and it's like 

198.84 200.83 A: right 

200.03 204.26 B: oh please you know [mn] but this is just ridiculous so 

201.80 203.39 A: right 

204.40 211.62 A: and now i guess now they have all the celebrity ones like the i'm a celebrity get me out of here and then the celebrity mole and all those [mn] 

211.51 221.48 A: i don't know [laughter] if anything does annoy me more than the regular ones 'cause the regular ones the ones where it's a contest where they can win it it's kinda neat to see just a regular person maybe win like survivor or something 

221.05 222.24 B: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

221.59 226.54 A: but when it's celebrities like they're already a celebrity they don't need that like they don't need the money they don't need [mn] 

226.78 229.53 B: yeah no i will admit i do watch ah 

229.80 234.86 B: [lipsmack] m._t._v. has a couple of series real world and road rules 

234.56 236.15 A: oh yeah 

234.63 245.29 B: now those i actually i i you know those i think are good i mean they're t- geared at a certain age yeah and i think you know those almost deal with more reality [mn] i think than some of these you know adult based shows supposedly do 

239.08 240.18 A: mhm 

244.93 246.35 A: well that's w- it's c- 

246.23 255.81 A: you're right it's like they're they're put into a situation that's not real [mn] but they really deal with reality like they deal with issues and working whereas on these other shows the people are so fake 

249.45 250.44 B: mhm 

255.32 256.33 B: mhm 

255.68 266.97 A: like when they're it's a competition or something they're all putting on such a front th- there's no real- it's it's just interesting to see how like horrible people will get and how back stabbing but [mn] the yeah i agree real world that used to be interesting 

266.60 267.62 B: (( yeah [mn] which was what it )) 

266.98 272.75 A: 'cause it's actually you know there's some interplay and it's neat to see how people interact and stuff right mhm [noise] yeah 

271.67 272.39 B: (( was all about i guess [mn] )) 

272.33 287.33 B: right exactly and they they would show you the stuff that these other shows seemed to cut out about you know how people really had to deal with each other's feelings and you know what it was like to all of a sudden have to live with you know [mn] nine other people that you didn't know or or you know and y- but yet they were working as a team 

287.19 300.96 B: you know towards a common goal which you know i mean the- most of these new shows the the goal is you know to beat out your competition to end up with you know this great prize that so yeah i think it's all disturbing [mn] [mn] [mn] 

296.72 298.56 A: yeah 

300.79 306.54 A: and i guess there's not i don't know i guess there's still several good like regular t._v. shows on too like 

306.37 319.82 A: 'cause i know a lot of like people like that do real t._v. [laughter] real t._v. [laughter] they're getting frustrated because it's it's like nowadays if it's not reality [mn] they can't compete basically but there's still a few good dramas out there and there are good other shows i think 

319.36 330.84 B: [mn] [mn] well i agree and i guess i've always just viewed um t._v. as entertainment that you know i wanna get away from the real world i wanna go sit in sitcom land or drama land for half an hour or an hour and forget about you know my reality 

325.04 327.18 A: (( right [mn] )) 

330.23 341.14 A: i agree [laughter] it looks like all the people who they make fun of american cinema because it's like happy endings and i'm like like why do i wanna go watch a movie i sometimes it's nice to go see a serious movie and learn something 

331.18 332.14 B: so 

335.85 337.01 B: mhm 

340.99 350.01 A: but most times when i go to the movie theater i wanna get away from it all and i d- i do i want my happy ending like you know that's it doesn't have to be real- like real to be 

350.12 352.46 A: [mn] what it is supposed to be i guess [mn] 

351.85 360.31 B: well that's it i mean as a rule documentaries don't do very good because people don't wanna see what's really what the real world's like they you know they want an escape and yet you know 

359.32 360.23 A: right 

360.43 366.89 B: they have these twisted t._v. shows and i just you know i i think back to different things i've seen and now you know these people are are 

366.92 377.47 B: capitalizing on it and they've become you know some talk show host or you know they're doing commentary for future auditions and it's like oh please these people have no life [mn] 

371.14 372.02 A: (( [laughter] )) 

376.66 379.82 A: right [mn] th- that's really true 

379.85 380.70 A: it's 

380.97 387.58 A: not going anywhere good and what they've done is not anything worthwhile and [mn] not much to recommend about it [mn] 

387.16 394.28 B: exactly to get off the topic for a bit 'cause i understand they cut us off promptly when our ten minutes is up how did you find out about this study 

391.92 393.30 A: [laughter] 

393.72 397.93 A: [cough] um through a mystery shopping web site oh [mn] [laughter] 

395.95 402.01 B: [mn] me too that's what i wanted [mn] so you do mystery shopping also yeah [mn] [mn] 

400.44 407.42 A: yeah [laughter] i i think quite a few of us ended up on there 'cause we hear about it i got it from [mn] lila's lounge 

406.69 410.60 B: yeah exactly that's where i got it from yeah so 

407.71 408.70 A: okay 

409.11 414.21 A: yeah well i'm i'm like i say i'm in the dayton ohio area 

413.54 417.12 B: okay well i'm in the akron cleveland area 

416.50 417.78 A: (( oh okay )) 

417.19 420.70 B: so we're still not competitors going back to another thread so 

418.48 422.42 A: no right i always feel that's a shop for you guys 

421.82 422.88 B: [laughter] 

422.53 433.28 A: it's always like mm do i really [mn] who do i know there that i can go visit [laughter] get some shops in [mn] but no yeah i'm actually pretty new to mystery shopping i just started like about a month and a half ago 

425.48 426.79 B: yeah 

428.71 429.56 B: yeah 

432.92 434.91 B: oh yeah you are a really newbie 

434.29 447.88 A: [laughter] my sister's been doing it for a couple of years and she's always like you should do this and you should do that and so finally [mn] my dad wanted to do some of the buffet shops [laughter] so to get him started i signed up so i could help him with it and then i started doing it so now i'm doing it quite a bit 

435.00 435.90 B: yeah 

444.76 445.77 B: yeah 

447.41 449.19 B: (( oh well that's good )) 

448.75 450.93 A: how long have you been doing it 

449.78 463.09 B: um i've been doing it for probably about five years now but i always always just did it you know just a little bit here and there just fun things but i was laid off in november so i i'm doing it trying to do it [mn] as a full time job but i just ah 

453.01 454.08 A: wow 

463.04 466.27 B: haven't quite got into that level yet so 

465.61 470.56 A: are y- is it is it are you getting pretty good at scheduling enough during the week or what's the 

470.34 473.49 B: y- yeah i mean you know i'm i'm 

473.65 484.80 B: when i can find the shops the problem is you know a lot of the companies with the rotations that i can pick a whole bunch from one month but then i have to sit back for a couple of months before i can do a bunch for 'em again [mn] so 

482.67 484.54 A: right right 

484.79 489.67 B: um i'm kind of still applying to new companies and trying to get in on new projects and such 

488.46 501.28 A: that's true bec- once you get enough rotations then you'll be okay but that's the thing i've noticed is that [mn] you do have like some of them you have to wait for 'em before you could do it again or there's some i know that i've done that i can only do it once like like for c- cell phones and stuff 

500.61 502.16 B: mhm 

501.82 504.58 A: but [mn] yeah 

503.31 508.38 B: yeah well good luck it it's a fun thing if you can you know get into it and get it going 

508.15 517.86 A: yeah my mom likes it 'cause i take her out to eat a lot now [laughter] she thinks that's great [laughter] i really what i'm trying to do maybe is get like a merchandising job that i can do regular 

510.66 511.58 B: yeah 

517.24 518.69 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

517.90 522.41 A: and then so like i have enough every week and then i can just fill in with the mystery shopping 

521.48 532.15 B: right yeah i mean that's what i've been trying to do too and it's just you know unfortunately there have been some many merchandisers at least in my area [mn] that it's really hard to crack into that so 

529.67 530.70 A: (( oh )) 

531.40 541.37 A: right yeah i don't see a whole lot of opportunities for it usually for me it's either like cincinnati that i have to go to or [mn] i mean i don't even see many for columbus actually 

534.50 535.40 B: yeah 

540.70 541.98 B: yeah 

541.57 556.54 A: [lipsmack] yeah it's hard to find them [laughter] [mn] and i don't i guess from looking for shops like the one that frustrates me the most is sassy shops because couple of companies like i sign up all the time [mn] and like the the sign up will like go dead like it'll be like 

543.72 545.05 B: yeah 

549.45 550.53 B: mhm 

556.37 562.43 A: [cough] like i'll sign up for like five days before and then it'll it'll no one will get it [mn] and it'll still be on there and they never assign it 

562.61 567.23 B: yeah but a lot of those i think have to do with demographics so like they're looking for a very specific thing 

564.87 566.64 A: (( [mn] that's what i figured )) 

566.87 577.28 A: that's what i figured but it's still like ah [laughter] that's the only bad thing i guess you sign up for 'em and you kind of want to keep your schedule open if you've said that and i guess i can always go back and take it off of sassy 

569.05 570.35 B: yeah 

576.91 578.36 B: yeah 

577.76 580.73 A: which is nice too i do like the set up there 

580.29 585.09 B: yeah [mn] oh this has been interesting is this your first call with fisher 

582.13 583.76 A: but 

584.67 586.40 A: yeah this is my first one 

585.94 599.65 B: yeah they had called yesterday and i was on the computer and they left a voice mail message and i called [mn] i was trying to make a point of getting off right at two today and i got off at two o three and of course they had left a message at two o two that they had tried to call and i thought oh no 

597.30 599.89 A: (( [laughter] [cough] that happened ))
