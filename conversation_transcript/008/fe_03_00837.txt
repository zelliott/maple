0.27 1.33 A: (( hello )) 

0.99 2.30 B: hi 

2.07 3.90 A: hi i'm lesley 

2.88 3.45 B: (( [mn] )) 

3.93 9.45 B: um my name is sven i'm a student at the university of pennsylvania 

8.51 12.38 A: oh hi yeah i'm ah lesley i'm at wayne state university 

12.38 13.62 B: okay 

13.62 15.46 A: that's in michigan [laughter] 

14.93 16.45 B: (( [mn] all right [mn] )) 

16.92 19.84 A: so um okay so time travel 

19.81 26.56 B: [laughter] time travel yeah do you think it's it's it will be possible at some time in the future 

20.16 21.50 A: [laughter] 

27.12 28.67 A: well um hm 

29.89 32.18 A: i'd like to think it would be actually 

33.09 34.16 B: um 

33.79 41.50 A: but um if we were to go back i think they wanted us to talk about if we were going to go back in our in our own lives and change something 

41.68 43.83 A: that's a little tougher [laughter] oh 

41.92 42.87 B: oh 

44.23 49.36 B: well i honestly don't think it'll ever be possible but um 

49.88 53.27 B: because i think if it was possible then 

53.51 58.39 B: we would have met someone who came back from the future 

58.44 60.27 A: that's an interesting thought 

60.66 63.30 B: and i never met anyone [laughter] 

62.46 63.46 A: true 

63.66 64.28 B: (( [laughter] )) 

64.89 66.09 B: so 

65.50 71.36 A: [laughter] or of course maybe the world gets destroyed in another twenty years and there's no one left [laughter] 

71.86 72.95 B: um 

72.96 79.74 B: yeah um that's that's a scary thought but that's entirely possible um 

76.05 77.40 A: yeah 

80.80 83.83 B: what would i change i don't really know 

84.39 86.74 A: yeah that's um that's a tough one 

87.00 89.14 B: [mn] um [mn] i think maybe some 

89.36 90.96 B: little things 

91.05 92.89 B: (( but ah )) 

94.17 99.59 B: i don't know i don't think i personally would change any major any major things i'm pretty 

100.22 104.81 B: pretty happy with the major the major things that have happened in my life so far 

104.93 108.46 B: of course there are a few little things here and there but 

108.41 116.97 A: [mn] i i agree with that because um you know if we were to change something we wouldn't really be ourselves if we changed those experiences right 

116.63 117.93 B: right 

117.56 123.22 A: but small things i'm racking my brain trying to think of what small things i might 

121.21 122.11 B: (( [noise] )) 

123.05 126.92 B: [mn] [noise] yeah [noise] um 

129.58 133.54 B: are we supposed to talk more about ah what 

134.11 136.89 B: you know the things we would change or 

136.27 141.07 A: that was what the the topic said which wasn't what i was expecting yeah um 

140.10 141.31 B: okay 

142.08 156.41 A: it's not a very interesting topic if you ask me [laughter] [laughter] no the the whole subject of time travel in general is much more much more fun [mn] because i'd like to think i agree with you that it probably won't happen um 

144.22 146.04 B: [laughter] 

150.48 152.54 B: (( yeah it's more interesting )) 

156.18 165.43 A: i think there are probably just too many physical problems but [mn] i've i've often thought you know it would be very interesting to um 

158.75 159.90 B: yeah 

165.78 171.24 A: to be able to not only go back in time but maybe to bring people forward and just 

171.51 174.38 A: [noise] experience oh dear i hope my phone doesn't die 

174.15 175.19 B: okay 

174.47 176.88 A: um experience 

176.49 177.62 B: the future 

177.31 181.47 A: [laughter] [mn] or even our time through their eyes you know 

180.77 184.38 B: oh bring people to our time from the past 

182.43 185.10 A: yeah yeah 

184.91 187.57 B: i've thought about that i mean 

187.91 198.88 B: i've thought about you know bringing things from our times back to like a hundred or five hundred years ago and what how people would react you know to see like 

197.32 198.29 A: right 

199.24 206.25 B: a nightclub a discotheque or something [laughter] like pounding baselines and flashing 

201.88 203.73 A: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

204.48 211.09 A: wha what would shakespeare think if he saw one of his plays performed or on t._v. or something yeah [laughter] 

206.32 207.24 B: (( lights )) 

209.18 211.83 B: yeah so 

211.86 216.08 B: yeah that's that's that's interesting yeah um 

216.06 230.01 B: i think actually [noise] travel into the future may become possible i mean theoretically it's possible i you know i've read a little bit about the relativity relativity theory 

228.21 229.59 A: right right 

230.28 235.19 B: and ah so it says if you if you move 

235.27 242.79 B: very fast compared to another person or another place then time will pass by faster for you 

236.38 237.30 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

243.02 249.35 B: so by that way you could kind of travel into the future but then you would never be able to come back 

250.14 260.43 B: you know you you could you could get on a spaceship and you can fly around in in outer space for like a year or say 

250.25 251.50 A: oh really 

260.59 270.69 B: you and the spaceship [noise] feel like a year has passed for you but then when you come back to earth ah five hundred years have passed on earth 

268.96 269.83 A: right 

269.87 272.00 A: but you can't go backwards in time 

271.24 273.90 B: but you can never go back and that's that's 

272.95 274.17 A: that makes sense 

274.14 276.81 B: yeah that's what happens for you and so ah 

276.47 285.73 A: but i just worry that um you know the physics of a human might preclude that kind of thing like maybe a particle could do it ah 

284.95 293.46 B: [mn] yeah i guess that's probably true 'cause you would have to move at speeds that approach the speed of light 

292.74 293.60 A: right 

293.58 295.55 B: somewhat and i think that's 

296.28 297.39 B: beyond 

296.39 306.86 A: have you have you ever thought when you were flying on a on a plane just the fact that you are going so much faster than everybody else that maybe there are a few seconds that you're [laughter] 

306.16 310.76 B: yeah [mn] maybe i mean i know that 

310.81 316.30 B: scientists have conducted such such experiments they put like highly accurate 

316.43 320.07 B: ah clocks on on an airplane 

320.02 333.48 B: like atomic clocks or whatever and then and then let the airplanes fly around the world and then when they stop that they actually could see that the clock on the plane was like a second or so or or a split of a second ahead of ah 

333.33 336.31 B: the same clock that was back [mn] 

336.43 339.08 B: back on the bases all the time so 

337.06 338.49 A: yeah 

338.50 345.61 A: that's an interesting thought you know if you fly all the time maybe you'll end up living five minutes longer [laughter] than everybody else 

343.65 345.40 B: [laughter] 

346.15 353.85 B: yeah i don't know if it if it makes that much of a difference if you can actually accumulate five minutes a little bit 

346.48 347.38 A: [laughter] 

349.96 350.80 A: (( no )) 

351.29 353.17 A: probably not [laughter] 

354.24 355.20 B: so 

355.90 359.24 A: mm maybe if you flew in a space shuttle all the time or something 

359.33 360.51 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

361.12 364.46 B: i don't know maybe not a good idea the space shuttle 

363.23 366.06 A: no yeah not now mm 

366.76 369.35 B: [noise] yeah well actually i 

369.67 372.49 B: guess if i had a chance i would still go on a space shuttle 

372.97 375.29 A: oh i definitely would no doubt 

376.04 377.77 B: (( so yeah )) 

377.60 380.25 A: but i don't know if i'd go on the russian one [laughter] 

379.90 380.76 B: [mn] 

381.29 382.32 B: um 

383.25 389.03 B: (( i don't know i think they the the track record in terms of safety are pretty much )) 

389.12 392.32 B: (( comparable i think )) 

391.71 401.32 A: well my dad was telling me that somebody when they first started the space program said that we could expect a major disaster every fifty missions 

401.23 407.13 A: and the challenger was right around fifty and this is i think one hundred and thirteen 

406.97 408.05 B: okay 

407.44 409.93 A: so i guess statistically 

409.97 411.18 A: we should have been 

411.70 414.91 A: expecting it yeah 

412.70 414.07 B: that's scary yeah 

415.64 417.59 B: so yeah um [lipsmack] 

418.80 427.35 B: yeah the russians have had their share of accidents too and the the americans i don't know i mean [mn] are we allowed to drift off topic 

426.56 431.98 A: [mn] well that's what i'm wondering i don't know what they're studying here so i don't know if we're supposed to just [laughter] 

432.37 435.55 A: um maybe we should stick to time travel um 

436.02 441.84 B: time travel oh time travel i mean i've discussed it so many times with friends but then 

437.16 437.77 A: (( mm )) 

439.93 441.40 A: yeah 

442.59 446.15 B: when it comes naturally it's so much easier to talk [laughter] 

444.92 446.46 A: [laughter] 

447.23 448.10 A: (( hm )) 

447.34 449.17 B: (( about it um [mn] )) 

451.82 463.53 B: um sometimes i have i have thought you know how how you could have changed the course of history if you if you had been 

463.63 471.88 B: if you were able to bring back you know certain things like say certain military equipment or something 

471.81 472.75 A: yeah 

471.94 479.65 B: into the past it could alter the outcome the result of wars or something or you could just warn people 

472.92 473.94 A: yeah 

477.21 478.72 A: yeah 

479.87 483.55 B: and tell them what would happen so it doesn't happen 

483.72 485.37 A: sure yeah 

484.46 487.72 B: [mn] but i think you could totally mess up things that way 

487.07 497.68 A: exactly i mean what would happen if one of us went back and and like killed a hitler or something of that nature then there's no telling what the world would be like 

492.90 494.09 B: yeah 

494.13 496.05 B: (( exactly )) 

497.09 498.74 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

500.64 501.93 A: (( i don't kn- well )) 

502.51 506.13 A: okay if if time travel were possible 

506.18 512.45 A: wouldn't you have to sit down pretty long and hard and think about whether you'd actually want to do anything i mean 

512.11 523.57 B: [sigh] i know i know there's been like so many movies about that topic and then sometimes in the movies you see like people disappearing from the pictures or something 

512.85 514.78 A: even the small things 

517.60 518.94 A: yeah 

521.89 523.45 A: [laughter] 

524.16 528.22 B: i don't know if that would actually happen but ah 

531.79 532.92 B: it's it's 

531.81 535.89 A: so maybe that's why you can't travel into the past you can only go into the future 

534.07 540.63 B: yeah so i guess yeah so it's definitely if you could it definitely would mean 

540.80 544.85 B: a big responsibility so y- you better 

542.41 543.57 A: oh yeah 

545.19 548.97 B: think about think about it long and hard so 

549.70 553.51 B: [mn] um yeah i think you could do some major damage 

553.75 558.23 B: [mn] of course you could also go back and like you know put all your money in the stock market 

557.83 559.53 A: that's true [laughter] 

559.60 563.29 B: [laughter] right before the internet boom and then take it out on a peak 

562.13 563.34 A: yeah 

564.23 566.73 B: or get all the lottery numbers right 

567.27 569.79 A: oh yeah tons of stuff you could do just mm 

569.03 570.32 B: all these things 

571.73 572.76 B: um 

574.80 576.10 B: [mn] yeah i guess it's 

578.52 580.23 B: (( [lipsmack] um [mn] )) 

579.85 593.08 A: you have you lost anyone close to you that i'm i'm thinking like some people might say if i could go back um i would tell my mother i loved her but it doesn't sound like either of us have had that sort of experience 

592.36 595.76 B: not really i mean my grandparents have 

596.27 599.20 B: passed away but ah i
