26.10 26.60 B: uh huh 

26.82 28.74 A: if you can go back to a certain time in your life 

28.78 29.39 B: yeah 

29.80 30.55 A: um 

31.36 32.20 A: where would you go 

32.38 33.03 B: uh 

34.13 36.06 B: i don't know do you have a good idea right now 

41.32 44.72 A: maybe the seventies maybe i would have um changed 

45.26 46.03 A: um 

46.86 49.51 A: the the direction i took towards education perhaps 

49.53 50.10 B: uh huh 

50.17 51.22 A: maybe something like that 

51.64 52.14 B: yeah 

51.75 52.14 A: and 

52.57 53.46 A: and yourself 

55.33 56.59 B: i don't know i don't think 

56.69 57.34 B: um 

57.71 58.59 B: i made 

58.75 60.73 B: that many important decisions yet 

60.84 61.72 A: uh huh 

60.95 61.34 B: but 

61.95 62.50 B: um 

61.95 66.92 A: are you you must you're still in school so you must be like uh in your late teens or early twenties 

66.70 68.38 B: i'm twenty three so 

68.03 69.09 A: ah ok 

68.77 69.44 B: um 

69.66 72.72 B: so far i've been trying to keep all my options open but i guess 

73.08 77.59 B: if i could go back to school i'd try to enjoy life more have more fun 

77.78 78.82 B: um be less 

81.81 82.50 B: um 

83.10 85.18 B: be less disciplined be more 

86.16 90.82 B: it's not like i was totally discipline but i just more focused on enjoying life i think than i did 

91.16 97.70 A: and you don't think you've enjoyed enough now you're only twenty three you have a really long time 

97.18 99.03 B: yeah i know i know but 

98.25 100.61 A: so enjoy life i'm forty so 

101.07 105.11 A: i've kind of uh been there i did the college thing and you know it was pretty cool 

105.27 106.05 A: um but 

106.62 108.01 A: yeah that's that's great 

108.72 110.11 B: i mean i try to do it now 

108.74 109.28 A: i i 

110.36 110.90 A: hm mhm 

111.49 113.33 B: what else anything else you would change 

113.29 115.01 A: um 

115.41 123.33 A: cause really i mean you know it's kind of hard to say i mean i'd rather go i'd rather go ahead and think of what i'd rather do then go back and what i can change 

123.32 126.37 B: yeah yeah it's the it's the same for same for me it's kind of dep- 

123.79 124.50 A: you know 

126.67 128.25 B: depressing to think about 

127.46 134.10 A: yeah it's like i i would rather move ahead not go behind so so if they had asked you know what would we want to do 

134.24 138.37 A: um in the future what would we expect i mean you know the thing is endless 

138.15 138.58 B: yeah 

138.48 143.34 A: as far as um you know medication and cures and stuff like that 

143.57 144.01 A: um 

144.13 151.35 A: with more research that's going on now you know it's just they'll be able to vaccinate shortly for uh nicotine addiction 

151.54 152.23 B: yeah that's 

152.00 156.07 A: and great there by two thousand and six perhaps and um 

156.40 159.46 A: if that helps that at all it will also help with people with drug problems 

159.59 160.05 B: yeah 

159.65 168.22 A: addiction so it's great if they can give you a vaccination toward towards blocking that to your brain so yeah so so to me the future is more really i'd rather look at that than 

168.64 170.24 A: you know than look back at the past 

170.60 174.70 B: yeah yeah that that that's a that's a good point i think i totally agree 

174.90 175.68 A: yeah 

175.82 176.46 B: um 

177.35 179.95 B: i don't know i think when you're like in school you don't have 

180.10 182.21 B: actually that many options so i pretty much 

183.19 185.76 B: i pretty much try to do everything i wanted to do like 

185.49 185.94 A: right 

185.96 187.13 B: i really wanted to 

188.15 195.22 B: like get international experience so i was in the u._s. a year as high school student and i was in spain for seven months 

195.28 196.01 A: wow 

196.18 201.90 A: well good for you no it sound it's great that you're traveling you're learning different things i mean knowledge is power 

202.23 204.80 A: so the more you learn the more place you go it's just 

204.63 205.33 B: yeah but 

205.09 205.89 A: it's a great benefit 

206.25 206.86 B: i guess 

207.33 207.97 B: i mean 

208.72 211.34 B: the only thing really i i feel bad about is like 

211.51 213.69 B: not enjoying things enough or not 

213.13 213.61 A: hm mhm 

213.95 215.54 B: telling myself enough that 

216.53 218.26 B: things are great and i should 

218.50 221.78 B: get less upset about little things and more focused on 

220.45 222.84 A: oh yeah don't sweat the small stuff 

222.68 223.57 B: yeah 

223.23 226.55 A: there's too many more important things to uh to worry about 

226.70 227.15 B: yeah 

227.19 233.29 A: you know so i mean you know just take life as it comes and twenty three you have a lot of bumps to go over but it's pretty cool 

233.48 233.89 B: yeah 

233.85 235.67 A: when you get up there and and you see things 

235.91 245.01 A: differently and how you would change and you know when you're forty you'll probably be able to say what you would change when you were twenty but right now at twenty three it's kind of hard to change anything because 

245.49 246.77 A: you just starting to live now 

246.95 247.44 B: yeah 

247.70 249.53 A: and experience so that's pretty cool 

249.63 250.36 B: yeah so 

250.48 254.48 B: what would you study something different or what do you mean exactly in terms of 

254.08 257.37 A: i think i would yeah i think i would have went into um 

257.99 260.78 A: more of a independent kind of business 

261.19 261.90 A: um 

262.34 267.52 A: i would have furthered my education i also would have like maybe pursued acting which is something i wanted to do 

267.61 268.10 B: acting 

268.29 275.83 A: yeah i really enjoyed that i did it in high school and in college and then i kind of you know realized that you know i don't know if i can make a living at this so i need to go 

268.79 269.40 B: wow 

276.26 276.74 A: you know 

276.98 278.72 A: get a job i can make a living at 

278.31 278.88 B: yeah 

278.93 282.22 A: so yeah i gave it up but i feel kind of bad that's something um 

282.45 286.56 A: i would have liked to have continued it was my major ri- well my minor in college at least 

286.61 287.66 B: whoa cool yeah that's 

287.79 288.61 B: that makes sense 

288.70 294.86 A: yeah so um that's fun i could do it now i mean uh i could do some community theater and stuff like that um 

295.30 298.36 A: and just do it for fun and not necessarily to make a living 

298.19 298.63 B: yeah 

298.65 300.12 A: but um yeah so that could be 

300.52 311.15 A: that could be something as an option so yeah i might do that i might go back and and say well i could have really pursued the acting thing and really gave it my all instead of just not being prepared to do what 

311.77 313.07 A: was expected of me at the time 

313.16 317.08 B: yeah but it's a very difficult task i mean so many people try it and eh 

317.19 318.64 B: it takes a lot of luck i guess 

318.43 322.54 A: oh it takes a l- you got to be just in the right place at the right time 

318.84 319.84 B: for it to work out 

322.18 323.36 B: yeah i mean 

322.68 330.84 A: you know i don't know but you but y- i guess you don't want to have any regrets and say well what if what if but it's never too late i'm only forty it's not like i can't do it now 

329.68 331.84 B: yeah sure i mean lots of time 

331.06 339.33 A: i'm not i'm not over the hill yet maybe like like fifty actually i saw this comedian once and um he was pretty cool um he uh 

339.57 342.29 A: he was like sixty seven years old and he just started 

342.77 343.36 A: performing 

343.53 344.09 B: wow 

344.09 351.44 A: yeah and he's like and that's what he said at the end of the show like you know this is for everyone who's always had a dream doesn't matter what age you are just go and fulfill it 

344.19 345.31 B: it's amazing 

351.69 352.08 B: yeah 

352.09 354.82 A: you know so um yeah it's never too late 

355.37 355.72 B: yeah 

356.34 359.20 A: and that should be uh that should be pretty interesting 

359.31 362.14 A: but um yeah what what do you uh what's your major 

360.04 361.06 B: yeah 

362.65 368.64 B: um i guess maybe i change that like in germany i study um international business and cultural studies 

368.75 369.26 A: uh huh 

369.27 373.29 B: like when i when i finished up the class i didn't know what i wanted to do 

373.36 373.80 A: hm mhm 

374.13 379.78 B: and in germany you have to like decide what you're going to do right at the moment that you enter university 

379.64 381.86 A: oh you don't have a chance to pick your uh 

381.66 382.35 B: no 

382.26 383.09 A: pick your curriculum 

383.88 385.06 B: so um 

385.30 387.27 B: i picked something very broad 

387.40 387.91 A: hm mhm 

388.04 392.14 B: it it includes like american studies um british studies 

392.29 392.97 B: um 

393.23 394.06 B: economic 

394.49 395.12 A: hm mhm 

394.58 401.46 B: business english spanish so it's very broad and i kind of regret that i'm not really specialized (( )) 

401.62 402.25 B: i feel like 

402.59 407.27 B: i know a little bit about a lot of things but there's like no one thing i know a lot about 

404.40 404.92 A: hm mhm 

407.25 407.97 A: yeah 

408.14 409.72 B: and i kind of regret that i guess 

410.33 411.60 A: well it's not too late 

412.35 413.59 B: yeah it's not too late but it's 

414.06 416.08 B: it's hard to change it at this point i guess 

416.14 419.42 A: yeah i suppose but you like it here in um 

419.85 421.36 A: in this part of america 

422.13 422.54 B: sorry
