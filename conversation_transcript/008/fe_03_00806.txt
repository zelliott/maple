5.41 5.68 B: so 

5.88 7.74 B: uh what do you think about today's topic 

9.09 10.31 A: um 

11.28 11.87 A: well 

12.05 14.29 A: it is an interesting topic that is for sure 

14.46 14.88 B: mhm 

14.69 17.44 A: if i could change something 

17.54 18.43 A: um 

19.53 22.13 A: you know hindsight is wonderful of course 

23.36 27.00 A: uh i probably really wouldn't change anything 

28.00 28.81 B: yeah 

28.11 29.08 A: um 

29.56 31.11 B: -cause that brings up the whole problem with 

31.88 33.20 B: if you go back and change something 

33.59 37.37 B: how would you know it won't just happen the same way or something else entirely different what will happen 

37.54 39.11 A: can you speak up just a little bit 

39.21 39.84 B: i'm sorry 

40.02 40.51 B: um 

40.03 41.57 A: uh it is hard hearing you 

42.01 42.95 B: yeah 

43.37 46.81 B: if if you were to do that how if something entirely different wouldn't happen 

47.91 48.49 B: at least 

48.60 49.13 B: with 

49.98 51.37 B: what already happened you know what what 

51.80 52.63 B: is going to happen 

52.79 54.94 A: right what the outcome is going to be right 

56.35 57.62 A: um 

58.65 61.19 A: you know i feel that i'm i'm wiser 

61.54 62.56 A: i'm older 

63.11 66.07 A: i you know i know more at this stage of the game but 

66.75 67.84 A: i you know 

68.24 71.90 A: i don't think i really would change my life i guess i 

73.27 74.64 A: -cause if you changed it 

74.83 77.06 A: you wouldn't know what else would happen to you 

77.13 78.93 B: well uh here is a question 

79.12 80.41 B: if you were to uh 

82.14 83.14 B: go back in time 

85.18 87.13 B: would you a- would you actually change anything or 

87.28 88.16 B: would you just watch 

89.56 92.01 B: -cause you could be in two places at once if you went back in time 

100.24 101.06 A: uh 

102.93 104.50 A: i think i would just watch 

105.87 107.44 A: i think i would just watch 

105.99 106.29 B: yeah 

108.22 109.48 A: how things i i 

109.59 113.10 A: i wouldn't change anything for myself i would change i guess for the world 

113.85 114.63 A: uh 

115.17 115.57 A: that 

116.00 121.73 A: there wouldn't be any wars and there wouldn't be any famine and there wouldn't be any uh killing and and 

121.85 122.44 A: you know 

122.75 123.60 A: there wouldn't be any 

124.43 127.51 A: uh heartaches those kinds of things i would change 

127.66 128.06 B: well 

127.82 129.24 A: but nothing for myself really 

130.09 131.48 B: i (( )) if you actually go about 

132.02 132.60 B: (( a )) voiding 

133.02 134.87 B: major conflicts like i don't know 

135.13 135.92 B: wars or 

136.12 137.42 B: famines or things like that 

139.07 142.07 B: i mean j- just going back in time it just means that you are another person there 

148.36 149.01 A: i don't know 

149.81 150.57 A: um 

154.05 158.17 A: i i don't know this is a tough question 

157.61 158.18 B: yeah i know 

158.35 159.94 A: this is a real tough question 

160.09 162.05 B: well i one thing i think would be interesting 

162.41 163.26 B: go back and 

163.65 164.05 B: think i'd 

164.15 165.12 B: d- all those things that 

165.66 170.74 B: are considered controversial uh controversial uh scholars you know where they don't know what actually happened 

171.37 172.11 B: and just watch 

172.48 173.12 B: that way you know 

174.74 175.46 A: watch huh 

175.82 176.85 B: yeah like um 

178.18 181.10 B: who wrote all shakespeare's plays 

181.68 182.73 B: go back and check 

183.12 183.86 B: see that guy there 

184.12 184.89 B: named bill 

185.18 185.66 B: yes 

189.05 189.69 A: ah 

192.17 193.85 A: how long are we supposed to talk for 

194.06 195.67 B: i assume ten minutes 

196.04 196.65 A: ten minutes 

197.57 198.77 B: think we are a little over two now 

201.07 202.65 A: are you just a random person 

203.25 203.89 B: i assume so 

204.24 204.81 A: okay 

207.21 209.23 A: um this is the first time i'm doing this 

209.78 210.41 B: um same here 

210.87 211.29 A: uh-huh 

213.67 216.22 A: um alright how i guess 

216.34 219.12 A: we have to keep talking about this particular topic 

220.57 221.82 B: well here here is a real easy one 

222.40 223.61 B: if you could go back and 

224.13 226.40 B: you know to sign uh to sign up for this little 

226.77 227.46 B: experiment again 

227.66 228.05 B: would you 

228.90 229.98 A: this experiment 

230.80 232.75 A: well 

232.01 233.19 B: it you've been that many 

233.65 235.16 A: uh 

235.65 238.02 A: yeah i guess i why not 

238.33 238.96 A: i mean 

240.64 246.30 A: it this is a tough top- topic but i don't know what you know the next topic would be it could be easier 

246.79 248.75 A: it could be harder too but 

250.05 254.53 A: you know it is just something i never really thought about i i never gave it that much thought because 

255.52 258.58 A: i i know that i can't go back in time you know 

258.87 259.61 A: um 

260.13 262.81 A: i want to go forward i don't want to live in the past 

263.83 264.52 B: that is a good outlook 

263.89 264.67 A: so 

264.78 266.43 A: i don't really give it that much thought 

267.98 269.38 B: well the one thing i've been wondering 

270.70 272.63 B: why are they uh choosing u- uh 

272.78 276.18 B: a a rhetorical question like that for a uh speech study 

279.37 281.67 A: i just got the impression that 

281.84 283.33 A: it is not really the question 

283.47 286.21 A: that they are analyzing how people speak to one another 

288.13 290.35 B: yeah that that is probably one of the things that they are doing 

289.09 293.50 A: that's that is the thought that came to my mind uh i didn't really think it would 

293.75 295.85 A: be what the topics are per se 

300.53 302.64 B: well what do you suppose that they are going to be doing with 

303.55 305.55 B: information that they get from this are they like going to be 

305.78 306.86 B: analyzing to find out 

307.39 311.43 B: oh these people are stressed -cause they don't know each other that they are talking with they think it is hard 

312.65 314.43 B: or are they just going to be like oh 

315.02 316.77 B: words like this occur in this order and 

317.49 318.07 B: stuff like that 

319.51 320.94 A: i that i don't know 

321.13 323.71 A: but i i just didn't really think that it would be this 

323.97 327.52 A: specific topics that they were going to give but i guess they have to pick 

328.03 329.90 A: some topic because otherwise 

330.73 334.49 A: you know we would all sit here and not know what to say to each other 

334.52 337.10 B: yeah d- do basic chit chat like hi how are you 

336.72 338.36 A: right exactly 

338.59 340.77 A: so they had to come up with topics 

341.41 343.10 A: but i just got the feeling that 

343.66 345.31 A: they are looking for other things 

351.92 354.35 A: so our speech patterns our um 

354.80 357.67 A: you know interactions um that kind of thing 

359.09 361.08 B: pretty certain that uh they are analyzing 

361.23 361.79 B: things like 

362.31 362.71 B: the 

363.10 366.05 B: tone of your voice how it changes over the course of the conversation 

365.73 366.13 A: right 

366.26 367.31 A: things like that yeah 

367.07 369.89 B: c- -cause that explains why they would have us go for ten minutes 

370.97 376.70 A: yeah ten minutes is kind of long i'm actually um 

378.30 380.09 B: yeah i usually don't stay on the phone for more than 

380.76 381.60 B: two or three minutes 

382.38 385.35 A: well it depends you know if i'm talking to a friend and 

385.62 385.99 A: goes 

386.47 388.00 A: more easily but 

388.10 388.56 A: you know 

388.91 390.75 B: yeah i usually don't have a lot that much to say 

389.07 390.71 A: to a stranger and the 

390.88 392.06 A: it is a little tougher 

394.65 395.30 A: um 

396.19 401.81 A: forgot already what the topic was if we could go back in time you know what time i would really like to 

399.59 399.90 B: yeah 

402.06 404.48 A: i would love to re-explore dinosaurs 

405.95 407.93 B: i think that would be pretty interesting except for the whole 

408.66 409.27 B: gigantic 

409.38 410.87 B: things that can eat me just like that 

411.01 415.08 A: well not if they were uh vegetarians 

415.92 416.96 A: they wouldn't want to eat you 

417.01 417.80 B: they would just step on you 

418.52 419.24 A: right that's 

419.51 420.40 A: for sure 

422.48 423.33 A: but um 

424.07 425.29 A: that fascinates me 

428.60 430.79 B: i think it would be interesting to go back to like 

431.30 433.39 B: i don't know r- rome or somewhere like that 

435.05 437.93 B: after all the they always say such interesting things going on there 

438.40 438.89 A: uh-huh 

441.60 442.82 A: would you fight uh 

443.13 444.99 A: in an area as a gladiator 

446.77 447.49 B: no 

447.64 451.86 B: no i i i studied uh latin for a few years and 

448.80 449.58 A: not you huh 

453.11 454.23 B: i had to go over like 

454.57 455.89 B: exactly what they did in the arena 

456.32 456.77 A: uh-huh 

456.36 457.93 B: did some really nasty stuff 

459.12 460.84 B: so not to partial to that 

461.36 463.20 A: wouldn't like being fed to a lion huh 

463.40 464.67 B: that wouldn't be too much fun to me 

465.62 466.61 A: are you a college student 

467.37 468.73 B: actually no i'm a high school student 

469.49 470.29 A: you are in high school 

473.81 475.00 B: is it real surprising
