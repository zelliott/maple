147.02 147.71 B: (( [sigh] )) 

147.45 149.95 A: i'm not sure if schooling down there is different 

150.12 151.09 B: um 

151.39 158.97 B: teachers definitely aren't treated as well down here i think that's why we have a lot of problem with um too many kids in classes 'cause 

153.63 154.59 A: (( oh really )) 

159.40 172.04 B: teachers are paid i think less than minimum wage around here [laughter] yeah yeah it's it's pretty bad so you y- you can easily have like thirty kids in a class 

162.92 165.52 A: really oh my goodness 

171.41 172.67 A: wow 

172.27 173.88 B: so which i

176.04 177.07 A: (( no )) 

177.48 183.10 B: but they ah they don't get the benefits they should and i think that 

178.09 179.22 A: wow 

183.32 184.22 B: (( well )) 

184.35 192.77 B: i went to a fairly good school district and then i moved down i lived near an army base and i can tell that the ah the quality of education's much 

193.20 194.35 A: (( oh really )) 

193.68 196.57 B: (( lower [laughter] yeah [mn] )) 

196.29 202.63 A: i think the schooling up here is pretty good i think most of the teachers i mean get paid pretty well 

202.39 203.33 B: mhm 

203.95 206.07 A: [noise] with the three months off and yeah 

205.72 206.99 B: true true 

207.31 208.61 B: (( [laughter] [lipsmack] [mn] )) 

208.27 211.48 A: and as far as the learning goes i think it's pretty good around here 

216.62 217.60 B: [laughter] 

217.31 220.00 A: [mn] [mn] hm now what [laughter] 

218.36 219.86 B: [laughter] 

223.65 227.99 A: [mn] [noise] i don't think that classroom sizes are as big up here though 

224.20 224.79 B: (( [mn] )) 

227.70 228.54 B: (( no )) 

228.57 229.92 A: huh-uh like 

230.41 232.74 A: maybe twenty twenty 

231.85 234.27 B: that's not too bad 

232.86 234.02 A: huh-uh 

235.93 239.36 B: that's a lot a lot to manage especially in like elementary school 

236.23 236.79 A: (( yeah )) 

239.94 241.58 B: classes [mn] 

240.92 242.81 A: yeah i think that'd be hard 

242.49 243.66 B: (( yeah )) 

243.87 244.74 B: (( oh )) 

244.08 246.58 A: (( [mn] kids can get pretty wild [laughter] [mn] hm )) 

245.05 248.44 B: (( yeah [laughter] [sigh] )) 

251.08 255.68 B: hm [lipsmack] so what can be done to improve them i guess that's part of the ah 

256.07 257.32 B: the topic 

257.75 258.69 B: hm 

258.30 261.61 A: maybe like you said lower the class size [noise] [noise] 

262.05 264.06 B: yeah 

263.35 264.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

265.49 271.40 B: we have a severe lack of teachers down here especially for english as a second language that's that's a big thing here 

267.73 268.85 A: really 

271.27 272.53 A: (( really [noise] oh )) 

272.15 278.07 B: (( oh yeah [laughter] we have we have quite a few mexicans here [laughter] yeah but um )) 

273.22 275.84 A: (( oh [laughter] [noise] )) 

280.14 285.12 B: yeah i guess i i think they need to improve the benefits down here for teachers 

284.99 288.55 A: yeah maybe even one on one training with the kids 

288.28 290.10 B: right right 

288.90 292.45 A: that are behind [noise] 

290.11 291.04 B: mhm 

292.70 293.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

293.91 295.82 B: it seems like many people aren't 

295.93 298.08 B: really motivated to be teachers down here 

298.26 299.34 A: wow 

298.56 301.82 B: between the low pay i think they get paid about 

302.22 305.46 B: maybe thirty thousand a year maybe 

303.99 304.69 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

305.08 306.48 A: wow 

305.89 308.79 B: yeah i've seen as little as like twenty seven starting 

309.08 311.53 B: depending on what area you're at but ah 

311.76 313.65 A: (( wow that's not a lot at all )) 

312.39 315.50 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

316.00 321.18 B: yeah it's it's not much you definitely don't go into that for the pay [laughter] 

319.41 324.48 A: wow i don't i don't know what they get paid up here but i think it's more than that anyways 

323.89 328.46 B: yeah i think i think it's a little bit more the cost of living's a little lower down here but ah 

330.06 334.08 B: yeah between the benefits and 

335.07 337.78 B: and the pay yeah it it's not [mn] 

337.87 338.76 B: (( i don't know )) 

340.72 347.69 B: not too impressive [laughter] i was actually thinking of moving to pennsylvania to um oh what was that college up there 

348.27 349.16 B: (( mm i )) 

350.40 355.23 B: think it's in harrisburg i can't remember there was a teacher college up there i was going to go to 

352.69 355.28 A: [laughter] [noise] i'm not sure 

355.56 356.60 B: harrisburg 

356.10 357.15 A: [noise] 

357.19 358.56 A: (( i don't know )) 

357.63 360.00 B: yeah i think that was it [mn] 

359.64 360.92 A: [noise] 

361.13 364.51 B: i can't stand the cold though [laughter] 

362.49 364.95 A: [laughter] you think if 

364.96 368.42 A: there was like better pay there would be more teachers 

368.07 369.34 B: i think so 

368.74 370.68 A: and then they'd be better 

370.40 372.38 B: i think so um 

373.91 381.55 B: yeah we just have a we have a huge shortage down here and that was one of the the big um for the governor's race 

378.62 380.85 A: (( mhm )) 

381.72 387.82 B: that was a big topic was how well they were going to fund education and teachers 

388.28 394.67 B: [sigh] i don't think either one either candidate was going to do too well for that but [laughter] [laughter] 

391.84 393.44 A: (( [laughter] oh jeeze )) 

395.55 396.63 B: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

399.18 400.33 B: [laughter] 

399.28 402.20 A: well i really don't think it's like that up here [noise] i think 

402.40 407.21 A: for the most part that it's pretty good i think that maybe they could have more one on one training 

406.87 408.66 B: mhm 

407.33 409.56 A: for the kids that are lagging behind 

409.01 410.04 B: right 

409.63 413.82 A: [noise] but other than that i think everything up here is pretty good [noise] i 

413.74 414.53 B: (( hm [sigh] )) 

418.60 427.64 A: think some people say have them go to school on week weekends or even [noise] more through the summer but i think it's good that they have their summer off that's 

427.39 428.88 B: right right 

427.76 429.65 A: something that they look forward to 

429.60 431.45 B: yeah 

430.16 433.18 A: (( all year long it would really be a [noise] )) 

432.49 433.67 B: [laughter] 

434.28 436.51 B: [mn] summer always seems really long to me 

437.15 442.67 B: [mn] like it seemed like okay well we've had you know a month off okay now it's time it's time to go back 

441.70 443.51 A: (( yeah )) 

443.86 444.77 B: and um 

445.16 449.38 B: i don't i don't know about complete year round schools and 

447.51 449.30 A: (( [noise] no )) 

450.86 453.45 A: maybe even longer vacations then 

452.67 454.31 B: [sigh] mhm mhm 

454.49 457.72 A: shorten it up at the end i don't know [noise] 

456.58 462.16 B: yeah i mean it works better for college 'cause we we got actually six weeks off for winter break 

461.63 462.86 A: oh wow 

462.38 466.61 B: it makes it a lot easier to plan for you know vacations and that sort of thing 

464.40 472.02 A: [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] here 

467.68 468.65 B: but 

471.86 473.01 B: (( ah [laughter] [mn] )) 

478.89 480.21 B: (( [lipsmack] hm )) 

479.61 482.92 A: [mn] i don't know [laughter] it's kind of different because 

480.35 482.10 B: [laughter] 

483.14 486.00 A: like you said the schooling down there's different from up here 

485.77 486.69 B: right 

486.76 492.79 A: 'cause i think they get good education around here for most of the schools around here you've always got the schools that 

494.46 496.55 A: aren't as good and 

495.98 496.86 B: right 

497.33 499.25 A: but i think for the most part 

500.00 501.28 A: they're pretty 

501.44 502.69 A: well taught 

502.77 504.70 B: yeah i think they're they're pretty 

505.83 507.37 B: pretty good down here

539.17 540.35 B: [laughter] 

541.58 543.67 B: it's kind of hard to fill up ten minutes 

543.12 544.43 A: i know 

545.01 546.05 B: [laughter] 

547.52 550.84 A: don't really want to talk much about school now that i'm out [laughter] 

549.89 551.91 B: (( right [laughter] ))

575.31 576.81 B: [lipsmack] um 

578.11 581.03 B: let's see about 

582.02 591.10 B: some time around eight till about i don't remember elementary school and middle school i think it was about two or three and then high school got out gets out around four 

591.36 592.49 A: that's the same 

592.71 596.52 A: well actually i think most places around here the high school gets out earlier

598.40 599.27 B: (( hm ))
