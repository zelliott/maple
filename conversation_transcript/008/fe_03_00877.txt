184.95 190.75 A: go up to get a movie i can never remember what they are and now the time i think about -em 

188.19 188.81 B: yeah 

190.95 194.38 A: they are already put back in to the old ones and then i 

194.52 196.41 A: i'm just lost in the new ones 

196.73 197.70 A: i just can't uh 

198.60 199.80 A: i just don't enjoy

202.18 203.15 A: no good 

202.94 203.41 B: yeah 

205.18 205.65 B: i think 

205.88 211.31 B: the next movie we're planning on seeing in the theaters will probably be the matrix reloaded

214.61 215.11 B: yeah 

215.22 221.76 B: we saw the first one and bought it and then i heard they were going to have the third part coming out in november 

222.47 223.72 B: can't remember what it was called 

223.91 224.56 B: something else 

225.16 227.78 A: some of those movies you can't see just once 

227.96 228.64 B: oh i know 

229.07 229.45 B: yeah 

239.51 240.03 B: uh-huh

249.97 253.84 B: but i haven't i haven't watched it i've had it probably for six months and still haven't watched it 

253.76 257.94 A: oh really well i think once you start watching it you really get in to it did you read the book 

257.00 257.51 B: yes 

258.16 261.10 B: um when i was in high school i think we we read it 

260.04 260.50 A: oh 

261.28 262.76 B: but other than that i've not 

263.54 265.28 A: well i i um 

265.80 275.33 A: i finally my daughter gave me um harry potter books and i thought oh i will never read something like that but i started the first one and i really enjoyed it 

275.45 278.87 A: and i did see the movie but i didn't think the movie came after the book 

278.89 282.27 B: really well i saw the movie but i didn't i didn't really like it so 

282.40 282.84 B: i might 

282.58 283.04 A: well 

282.96 284.63 B: try reading 

284.14 287.13 A: well the book uh was interesting i'm i mean i'm 

299.89 301.47 A: pretty very imaginative 

301.91 302.34 B: hm 

302.54 306.66 A: but it's a lot like the lord of the rings i guess the lord of the rings is more of the adult 

307.16 308.19 A: harry potter 

308.18 308.63 B: yeah 

308.99 310.86 A: but um i did like it but
