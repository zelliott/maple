54.82 57.72 A: and even less control over the students then 

58.41 60.32 A: even um five years ago

74.11 74.68 B: i don't know i 

75.13 75.86 B: i guess 

76.23 77.82 B: the metal detectors in a way they're 

77.95 78.80 B: they're good but 

80.72 81.90 B: kids nowadays are bringing 

82.58 83.76 B: guns and knives to school

94.84 96.55 A: to a um 

96.98 98.22 A: an assault 

98.61 101.41 A: the mother of a thirteen year old student

112.00 113.95 A: this was in the um 

115.22 117.67 A: early seventies and um 

124.83 131.14 A: and the scissors that she used to try to kill him with were on the school property anyway so 

130.86 131.28 B: right 

131.38 133.87 A: what does the metal detector do 

135.43 136.08 B: that is a good 

137.26 137.79 B: i don't know 

139.84 140.49 B: very true 

141.35 142.52 B: a lot of different ways to look at it 

144.02 144.54 B: i don't know 

144.71 145.68 B: metal detector 

146.02 146.95 B: to a certain extent 

147.08 147.33 B: keep 

148.01 149.31 B: guns from getting in to school 

150.01 150.41 B: should 

150.85 152.91 A: do they i mean um

159.10 159.47 B: yeah 

160.90 161.26 B: well 

161.77 163.69 B: it depends i (( got )) a security (( )) too 

166.04 166.75 B: as far as 

166.91 167.62 B: security 

167.84 168.42 B: checking 

170.01 172.33 B: you know and keeping track of metal detectors or whatever 

177.48 177.80 B: hello 

178.01 180.14 A: i'm here um 

179.20 179.65 B: oh 

180.97 181.54 A: i don't know 

181.64 182.30 A: i would 

182.41 189.14 A: think that in a certain sense that it started the the breakdown of the family unit you know 

189.30 194.73 A: um my mother has stories of her grandmother um 

196.05 197.49 A: my grandmother rather 

197.92 198.59 A: where 

198.77 200.70 A: if you got in trouble at school 

200.84 206.62 A: you got clobbered at school and then you got clobbered at home for daring to uh be a pain in 

207.31 208.49 A: school 

208.63 208.99 B: right 

210.48 213.68 A: and now you walk on the street and 

213.83 220.27 A: someone was ready to jump jump my bones because i dared say but you shouldn't litter 

229.87 230.69 A: you know the 

230.95 238.88 A: um it takes a village to raise a child in hillary's lovely words but in a certain sense it was true everyone was 

239.09 250.15 A: all saying the same message now you have a a bunch of different messages and then in fact one of the prime messages is don't bother about me mind your own business 

251.05 251.43 B: right 

254.04 254.52 B: yeah 

256.78 258.37 B: got all different kinds of people in the world 

262.76 264.76 A: it almost makes you um 

265.76 267.84 A: thing that you're um 

268.44 270.90 A: living in a place where it is 

271.22 274.22 A: not any of your business to um 

274.85 276.19 A: to look out for 

276.59 280.32 A: what someone else is doing um there's a 

280.81 282.53 A: set of science fiction 

283.75 284.87 A: uh novels 

291.44 299.36 A: to tell a person of another clan and the clans are the families how they should behave well we have that now only 

299.49 308.16 A: um in a certain sense we we still tell people of other clans how to behave only if we are in um a position of authority 

308.72 309.08 B: right 

314.17 314.88 B: where there's not 

315.29 315.87 B: enough 

317.02 318.78 B: positions of authority as far as 

319.21 320.48 B: cops or whatever goes 

321.42 321.89 A: well the 

321.51 321.76 B: the 

322.05 327.58 A: there are positions of authority and then there are positions of authority for example i was um 

327.86 330.50 A: walking across the street and 

330.64 331.32 A: um 

331.64 332.69 A: the policeman 

333.56 336.33 A: uh ran the um crosswalk 

336.44 337.64 A: and yet the maryland 

337.87 345.00 A: law which is so clearly posted in that area is um yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk 

345.10 348.40 A: so you you have the the uh creative 

348.56 350.36 A: this union of 

350.68 353.32 A: do as i say and not as i do 

355.47 356.61 A: um 

356.85 359.85 A: and then you have um a bunch of 

360.71 366.24 A: highly pr- highly publicized um things like columbine 

366.34 367.48 A: you know 

368.17 368.43 B: that's 

368.83 370.32 B: exactly what the kids want 

371.75 372.12 A: hm 

371.98 374.64 B: the certain extent as far as getting on t._v. and stuff 

379.01 379.86 B: for what they did 

383.86 392.87 A: n- so the question is is this all there is i mean in the certain sense when you had a church that was declaring an afterlife um 

393.74 399.15 A: you not only had the fear in this world but you had the fear in the next you know um 

400.47 401.62 A: with um 

403.44 405.06 A: with the general decline 

405.35 406.10 A: um 

406.50 414.62 A: no one is going to hell and they're once they are dead they are dead and so sure they get their little moment in the sun um 

414.90 416.49 A: the columbine folks but 

417.87 420.43 A: they are dead and who cares 

422.67 424.42 A: or maybe i'm 

426.66 427.53 A: not making sense 

428.53 429.33 B: i understand 

429.52 430.29 B: what you are saying 

435.78 440.45 A: so does this make you want to run down to your local school and volunteer some time 

440.77 441.10 B: hm 

441.54 442.14 B: probably not 

442.72 443.24 B: i don't know 

444.29 444.59 B: i 

444.43 450.25 A: i'm afraid i i'm spending my volunteer time um at the old folks home 

450.46 455.84 A: i've given away all of my saturdays from now until the middle of april 

455.60 456.00 B: right 

457.60 458.83 A: but it it will take 

459.27 460.20 A: time 

460.62 462.08 A: and it would help if they uh 

462.19 464.48 A: paid the teachers a little more 

464.58 466.06 B: oh most definitely 

467.34 467.98 B: yeah there's 

468.01 469.92 A: did did you hear the creative 

468.19 470.26 B: definitely the teachers definitely get underpaid 

470.50 477.62 A: oh did you hear the creative way that uh prince george's county is um keeping is getting their first year teachers 

478.27 478.67 B: no 

479.06 484.04 A: instead of paying them a living wage what they do is they co-sign the teachers 

484.25 488.24 A: uh lease because the teacher doesn't really make enough to um 

488.44 490.72 A: afford an apartment in prince george's county 

490.91 491.41 B: mhm 

493.05 495.98 A: and so in a certain sense it's a company store 

496.26 502.98 A: you know i i dare and make any waves because not only would i be out of a job but i would be out a place to live 

507.75 508.18 B: wow 

509.08 511.74 A: that's prince george's county maryland um 

510.14 510.57 B: bad 

511.93 513.44 A: where are you at 

513.06 514.30 B: fort wayne indiana 

514.93 515.38 A: ah 

516.14 523.34 A: um you should be seeing some of the the thrills of the immigration policies i understand that they are um 

516.39 516.86 B: yes 

524.70 528.93 A: the immigrants are being moved to the quote on quote heartland 

529.25 529.99 A: and 

529.75 530.11 B: right 

531.18 532.68 A: um 

532.78 538.33 A: iowa has the best uh scores um on the national ed- 

538.76 541.84 A: educational tests the n._a._e._t. -s 

542.03 543.41 A: but um 

543.89 547.37 A: that may decline if they get to big an influx 

549.67 550.11 B: huh
