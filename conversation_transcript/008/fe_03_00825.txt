87.77 92.19 A: oh did you um the topic i don't know if you heard it but the topic is we are supposed 

92.35 92.73 A: to 

93.37 93.87 A: um 

94.70 100.21 A: the general topic is time travel and we are supposed to talk about if we could go back in time and change one thing that we did 

100.97 101.63 A: what would it be 

102.55 103.09 B: oh okay 

104.23 104.93 B: that wouldn't be re- 

104.36 104.81 A: um 

105.70 106.18 B: okay 

106.89 107.77 A: so um 

106.96 107.32 B: what 

107.58 108.73 B: oh okay so we just 

108.99 110.20 B: express back and forth to 

110.53 111.07 B: to each other 

110.54 111.17 A: yeah we just 

111.38 114.33 A: tell each other what it was and ask each other questions about it and 

115.34 119.38 A: talk for a couple of minutes and then they will beep at us when our time is up and that is it 

115.42 115.96 B: and that is it 

119.68 121.49 B: okay 

121.22 125.44 A: so yeah it is you know a little artificial but um 

125.79 126.19 B: yeah 

126.60 127.03 A: but 

127.24 127.73 A: um 

128.29 129.84 A: yeah so i was thinking 

130.07 130.53 A: um 

130.77 140.64 A: thankfully uh nothing leaps to my mind i'm glad that there is no major catastrophe or awful thing that i did that i would go back and undo but um i went to japan a few summers ago 

141.35 143.47 A: and i got to spend a month and a half there 

143.64 145.59 A: and while i had a great time i really wish 

145.80 146.86 A: that i could go back 

146.95 147.81 A: and do it again 

147.99 149.54 A: because i feel like 

150.65 151.97 A: i was 

153.06 154.07 A: too self-conscious 

154.42 157.18 A: um and i didn't make enough of an effort 

157.47 157.95 A: to 

158.84 161.11 A: really try to interact with people and my language 

161.27 165.56 A: abilities were limited so i was very self-conscious and always sort of embarrassed and um 

166.76 167.46 A: you know i really 

167.82 169.34 A: try and more kept to myself 

169.55 172.87 A: but if i c- i wish i could go back and do it again and just really 

174.12 178.39 A: be out there a hundred percent and trying to talk to people um i feel like i would've gotten 

178.55 179.37 A: so much more 

179.56 181.00 A: out of the trip 

181.13 188.91 A: learned so much more about culture and the people and i'm sure i would've had i i had a good time but i'm sure i would have had a great time if i had really 

189.47 191.16 A: you know sort of put myself out there and 

191.31 192.71 A: not been so worried about 

193.96 195.24 A: what people would think of me 

194.29 196.33 B: so if given an opportunity you would go back and 

196.55 200.65 A: yeah i would i would do it over i think i would do better the second time around 

200.88 203.15 B: think it is easier the second time around anyway 

202.99 204.98 A: yeah and i um and that is true 

205.20 206.38 A: that is true 

205.85 206.30 B: yeah 

206.97 210.26 B: i guess with me the only thing that comes to mind real quick is um 

211.10 211.57 B: uh 

212.23 212.81 B: the 

214.19 215.05 B: taking in a 

215.47 217.65 B: gosh there is so many so i guess i could (( priori- )) 

217.88 218.71 B: prioritize 

220.41 220.86 B: i have 

221.00 221.53 B: you know (( )) 

221.93 222.75 B: four kids and 

222.91 223.80 B: if i had uh 

224.23 225.02 B: go ahead and 

225.59 226.37 B: instead of 

226.86 230.65 B: going through and extending the date i had with him the first night 

230.82 231.27 A: mhm 

231.35 234.18 B: and -cause i had uh you know two dates that day and 

234.33 238.65 B: i said okay i'm going to be you know spending a couple of hours with this guy and then go spend a few hours with that guy and 

239.13 239.59 B: i ended up 

239.69 242.43 B: spending the whole you know the whole day with that guy and 

243.20 244.01 B: you know he wasn't 

245.26 246.02 A: wasn't quite 

245.89 250.01 B: yeah you know i had the kids with him and he i just wish i had to went back and 

250.80 253.48 B: you know went with the other guy -cause i think he would probably 

253.65 256.43 B: i don't know i don't know if he would have been a better father or not but 

256.98 260.63 B: the one that you know the one now he is just no attendance 

260.81 261.99 B: value whatsoever 

261.85 263.06 A: oh that is too bad 

263.07 264.81 B: yeah so i think if i had to 

265.00 265.46 B: you know 

265.77 268.95 B: choose something that would have been a nice one but i'm glad i have the kids 

269.32 270.63 A: well that is good 

269.59 270.84 B: yeah they are great kids 

270.97 273.23 B: they are great i mean you know they are very loving and 

273.75 275.77 B: and so forth and outgoing but 

276.24 277.86 B: it is just you know it is always nice 

278.63 279.59 B: i always feel like 

279.81 280.10 B: they are 

280.21 282.74 B: there is (( )) there are supposed to be two parents and 

282.82 283.29 A: yeah 

283.39 283.78 B: yeah 

283.99 288.16 A: it would be nice to have a partner if you could go back and talk to that younger you 

288.30 288.62 A: like 

288.87 290.18 A: what would you 

291.21 292.28 B: i'd say don't go out with him 

293.28 295.02 B: you were right when you first thought about it 

295.15 298.30 B: who cares if he knows everybody at the party 

295.22 297.00 A: so you had some 

298.58 300.89 B: he is a bum 

301.33 303.51 B: you can meet people after the party but he is a bum 

302.91 304.07 A: (( )) 

303.73 306.99 B: has no responsibility values 

305.72 307.41 A: uh yeah so 

309.09 312.01 A: so you had some initial reservations even then or was it 

311.54 313.27 B: yeah and i just 

313.63 316.79 B: uh he he kind of like uh did you know (( )) that that 

317.03 318.50 B: (( )) or thing where they 

318.95 321.27 B: you know they start talking about all their 

321.38 325.75 B: dreams and desires so i fell in love with his potential instead of the actual person 

325.81 326.40 A: got you 

326.30 328.56 B: and what he was trying to do at the time 

329.73 330.02 B: but 

330.21 331.99 B: you know and like i said i did get you know four 

332.16 333.49 B: beautiful kids out of it but 

335.20 336.22 B: horrible thing to 

336.39 336.85 A: yeah 

336.86 339.69 B: you know for them to have to and do it with him doing the 

339.81 346.76 B: well i don't want to do nothing with you unless your mom is coming and you know it is like we haven't been together for over twelve years and he still does this 

347.22 347.90 A: wow 

347.81 348.52 B: yeah 

349.22 354.00 B: and he makes little jokes oh you see i told you you were going to get married before me okay 

354.13 355.16 B: you know 

356.74 360.61 B: like you are just mad because i'm not married to you but okay whatever 

356.75 357.31 A: um 

359.98 363.22 A: so do you think you made a better choice the uh 

363.25 364.78 B: yeah the second time around 

364.16 365.19 A: the second time around 

365.79 368.54 B: he he is uh younger than me but he 

369.11 371.11 B: definitely got his feet on the ground you know he is 

371.61 374.10 B: got it you know start got his own business going 

374.22 376.54 B: kind of just started it about three years ago so it 

374.38 374.97 A: wow 

377.69 380.64 B: still got some rocky points it is one of those uh he does uh 

380.97 382.04 B: work at an auto body 

382.51 383.27 B: shop 

382.94 383.33 A: mhm 

383.61 387.96 B: so he runs the detail part of where they clean up the cars after they get through with it 

388.19 388.57 A: right 

388.70 398.73 B: and uh he supervises all those guys -cause you know that is his shop that is his -cause it is a family business and his dad broke it down where the older brother does all the painting and 

394.96 395.58 A: oh i see 

399.27 405.47 B: uh one brother does all the prepping for the cars that go to get painted and he does all the clean up and so forth and 

405.88 407.24 B: putting parts on that is his 

407.38 409.38 B: you know and they all own their little section 

409.91 411.08 B: so what you know they get 

411.23 414.81 B: you know the profits and break it down to their employees and you know that is their job 

415.09 421.10 B: you know to do all that their dad is just all he does is he is just the head guy and they pay him a certain amount every month 

422.45 425.45 B: -cause they are using his name -cause he has had the company you know forever 

425.00 425.46 A: right 

425.79 428.15 A: right that is really interesting though it sounds like um 

428.34 432.68 A: like a pretty good setup but i mean three years i mean hey he is obviously sticking with it and uh 

428.67 429.12 B: (( yeah )) 

432.39 433.54 B: yeah well yeah 

433.71 440.46 B: yeah well i mean he is only twenty six so you know i was like okay when you get a little older we'll see you know 

434.49 437.75 A: well yeah three years is longer than 

439.76 442.05 A: well three years is better than three months 

442.18 443.34 A: you know but uh 

442.37 444.81 B: yeah three years is better than nothing though 

444.42 445.05 A: yeah 

445.27 447.70 B: so i guess it is good you know and 

448.00 450.25 B: it is just he works so hard i mean he is there like 

450.84 451.21 B: six 

451.36 452.96 B: at least six days a week and 

452.60 453.11 A: wow 

453.37 454.57 B: you know and sometimes seven 

455.13 458.74 B: you know at least six and a half and you know he puts in a lot of hours and 

459.19 463.25 B: but it is still you know it is great because sometimes if we are around each other too much we 

463.71 468.34 B: you know i've gotten so set in my ways having raised the kids by myself and only going out on dates 

469.02 470.05 B: bring them home to the kids 

470.07 470.51 A: right 

470.62 473.63 B: and he is the first one that's been around them you know a lot 

474.17 474.97 B: you know and we've been together 

477.21 478.17 B: uh that was a good choice 

478.39 481.80 B: so and going back to the past yeah i'd still be with him and marry him but 

482.59 482.93 B: still 

483.61 484.75 B: still kind of interesting 

485.73 488.65 A: well that is awesome would you um do you think you would have 

488.79 490.90 A: if you could go back do you think you would have 

491.90 493.04 A: waited longer to 

494.04 496.42 A: get together with someone and start having kids or 

494.27 495.06 B: to have the kids 

495.34 495.84 B: yeah 

496.68 500.64 B: yeah most definitely 

501.25 504.85 B: and um when you went to japan and stuff when you were over there did you like 

503.07 503.43 A: mhm 

505.17 506.47 B: um meet people who 

506.61 507.41 B: who kind of 

508.35 511.55 B: made you feel like i mean where there other people with you who 

511.99 513.15 B: were more fluent or 

513.76 514.52 B: there you know 

514.49 515.67 A: yeah it was a um 

515.84 518.08 A: it was a program through my high school 

518.61 519.19 B: oh okay 

518.80 522.98 A: actually and so i had classmates but we each lived with a different japanese family 

523.06 523.67 B: oh wow 

523.84 525.33 A: so we were just sort of 

525.48 536.05 A: it was like we were suddenly the adopted foreign siblings yeah and every everyone was wonderful i don't want to sound like people made me feel uncomfortable but i just 

529.21 531.23 B: feel like huh huh yeah okay 

532.61 532.89 B: uh 

535.42 536.96 B: oh yeah i know what you mean 

536.51 537.31 A: you know i 

537.50 539.39 A: i had just never been in a situation where 

539.77 541.16 A: i couldn't communicate 

542.08 543.76 B: the way uh freely yeah 

542.16 545.01 A: to people even just basic things or you know if there was like 

545.16 548.75 A: a mixup about something or a misunderstanding it was so hard to get 

549.17 549.50 A: you know 

549.94 551.87 A: through that um and i always felt 

552.59 557.75 A: horrible if i if i accidentally said something i shouldn't have unintentionally or you know if i 

558.47 561.66 A: the customs are very different and so i was always very worried about 

562.23 563.85 A: doing something wrong and 

564.11 565.09 A: in retrospect 

565.42 567.96 A: i realize that my host family really just wanted me 

568.20 571.75 A: i mean they really just wanted to get to know me and talk to me and 

571.95 574.23 A: they weren't you know they didn't care if i accidentally 

574.49 579.65 A: said something that they probably you know they might be offended if some japanese did who knows the customs 

579.79 580.30 B: yeah 

580.72 581.28 A: so i just 

581.88 583.62 A: i i think i missed 

584.90 585.79 B: getting to have the 

585.96 587.00 B: full i know what you mean 

586.63 587.69 A: y- yeah i didn't 

587.85 599.71 A: i guess their sincerity didn't quite sink in and i didn't let that just be enough it's like okay you know even if i sound really stupid trying to tell them the story of what happened at class today you know i'm going to tell them because they are really interested
