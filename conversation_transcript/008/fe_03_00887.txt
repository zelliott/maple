448.52 450.28 B: you know pretending 

450.46 451.24 A: yeah 

451.34 457.15 B: so it was you know much easier for these kids to be actors than [mn] as grownups 

452.59 453.15 A: (( [mn] )) 

456.98 461.65 A: exactly they can't go out here and act like hey i'm joe [mn] you know

467.39 469.64 B: no i can't imagine that 

469.41 471.68 A: [laughter] or you know 

470.71 474.17 B: i can't imagine that my credit card doesn't let me imagine that 

473.07 478.34 A: i can't go out in my backyard and act like i'm going to kill an alligator [mn] or 

476.88 477.76 B: yeah 

477.95 479.60 B: right right 

479.04 479.80 A: [laughter] 

479.90 484.78 A: you know [mn] six year old kids acting like [mn] i'm getting married 

480.88 481.94 B: yeah 

484.78 491.63 B: right right i i i guess they're going to run their course but it you know i sure didn't think they were going to last 

485.47 486.90 A: exactly 

491.75 496.64 B: as long as they did the the reality based shows but they're 

493.32 494.25 A: i 

495.83 497.15 A: can't either 

497.33 502.33 B: but ah they don't seem to be slowing down in popularity in the least 

502.63 503.57 A: (( no sir )) 

503.93 505.48 B: so we'll ah 

504.58 508.89 A: i would have thought they were kinda you know kinda had their popularity and then 

508.94 511.69 A: just kind of you know went off t._v. 

509.75 510.68 B: yeah 

511.47 514.67 B: yeah maybe the second survivor would have been 

512.86 515.02 A: like a stage i guess 

515.08 517.43 B: (( you know over but ah )) 

517.26 523.64 A: [mn] but they just keep on it's like they got a lot of money just to give a million dollars out here and a million dollars out there and 

522.98 527.60 B: well truthfully it's pretty cheap television because ah 

525.12 525.80 A: [mn] 

528.05 531.42 B: you look at um oh i don't know 

531.61 533.53 B: just the show frazier 

533.54 539.94 B: he gets you know ah i don't know the exact numbers but he gets over a million dollars per episode 

539.89 541.72 A: like friends 

541.05 552.85 B: yeah those guys you kn- each one of those guys are getting more than a million dollars per episode not counting [mn] the filming costs and the writers and all of that so 

552.87 555.32 B: these survivor things are pretty cheap 

555.62 559.70 B: forms of you know of television so it's not that it's 

559.86 561.98 B: you know it's that it works 

562.74 563.80 A: yes sir 

564.40 565.97 B: so it 

565.25 575.06 A: [lipsmack] [mn] i know sometimes i wish i had a lot of money like some of these reality t._v. people do but then in other words i just think of how miserable i would be 

575.73 579.24 B: [mn] i'd like to give it a try out i don't know how miserable i would be 

578.92 585.42 A: [mn] well i mean not necessarily be miserable but just have so much money i wouldn't know what to do with it you know [mn] 

580.05 582.46 B: [laughter] 

584.13 590.88 B: well i think i think you know like they say that the money can corrupt the people but i think very often it's 

591.14 597.02 B: you're a pretty corrupt person already i mean i- if you're a good person i think you can you can 

596.85 598.44 A: you could find something 

597.35 599.89 B: you can think a few million dollars and 

599.45 599.95 A: yes
