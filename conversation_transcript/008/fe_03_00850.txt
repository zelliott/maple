22.29 26.27 A: um i guess the subject is about the public school systems 

25.66 27.05 B: public school systems yes 

26.47 29.75 A: yeah um well i live in a small town 

29.91 32.56 A: so most of our 

30.06 30.51 B: okay 

32.71 35.30 A: school system is congregated into one area 

35.53 35.89 B: uh-huh 

35.64 38.31 A: like our high school and our elementary school 

38.74 40.64 A: are all right in the same vicinity 

40.81 41.48 B: oh okay 

40.84 41.66 A: and 

41.87 44.34 A: we actually had to build on this year 

44.59 47.87 A: to accommodate the number of students that we have over here 

48.30 50.37 B: oh how did you how did the town afford that 

51.08 54.30 A: what they did was they uh it is funny to say but they um 

54.45 55.23 A: took 

55.97 60.40 A: trailers actually and kind of built onto the school like double wide 

59.18 60.02 B: oh so it is 

60.64 63.77 B: uh so it is not really un- uh it is just a temporary addition 

63.65 67.05 A: right it like units so the students have um 

65.30 65.72 B: mhm 

67.28 71.10 A: half hour intervals in -em and then they go back into the school 

70.89 71.33 B: wow 

71.44 74.06 A: so that we keep the numbers down as well 

74.35 76.32 A: to keep the students focused 

74.65 74.99 B: right 

76.28 76.69 B: uh-huh 

76.43 81.52 A: but it is mostly at the high school that we have to do that because for some reason the numbers have gone up 

82.30 82.73 A: um 

82.66 84.07 B: the numbers of students 

84.14 84.73 A: yes 

84.99 85.62 B: right 

85.24 89.57 A: yes so there is more people coming to live in our area because it is a small area 

88.26 88.58 B: ach 

89.85 90.30 B: right 

91.03 91.55 A: you know 

91.06 94.01 B: wow and did you and they didn't they didn't do a uh 

94.22 97.02 B: they didn't want to do any uh building onto the school or rebuilding it 

97.70 102.17 A: right we had to make a choice because i do live in a small town we have um camp 

102.30 106.68 A: actually at the same place and so it was a choice between 

102.62 103.00 B: mhm 

106.77 108.71 A: it is funny the built-in swimming pool 

109.39 112.21 A: or building onto the school 

111.99 113.61 B: so it was the swimming pool or the school 

113.65 114.77 A: right right 

114.50 114.77 B: oh 

115.11 115.80 B: oh wow 

115.21 115.91 A: so 

116.27 118.46 A: um the pool kind of won out over 

118.81 121.95 A: for for this point until next year when the budget 

118.89 119.39 B: really 

122.22 125.48 A: we can propose again to try to build um 

125.74 128.03 A: another wing onto the school or what not 

128.74 129.01 B: and 

128.82 129.41 A: so 

129.16 130.86 B: the the so the choice was 

131.01 131.51 B: for uh 

131.64 133.73 B: a pool instead of more classrooms 

132.51 133.02 A: right 

133.68 137.73 A: right yeah the priorities here i'm from massachusetts 

134.97 135.60 B: oh 

137.93 138.31 B: uh-huh 

138.44 143.64 A: and i have to tell you quite honestly moving to a small town like this it is funny what 

144.28 146.04 A: people consider priorities 

146.46 152.38 B: right did the they did they are they against raising the taxes or to to pay for a new addition or are they 

152.66 155.34 A: actually in new hampshire we don't have taxes 

155.16 155.69 B: oh 

155.85 156.83 B: oh that is right yeah 

155.95 156.60 A: yeah 

157.05 158.18 A: yeah so 

157.67 161.37 B: and not oh so but it was all paid for by property tax isn't it 

161.05 167.32 A: right right and you would think that they would want to build another wing onto the school i would prefer that 

167.12 167.53 B: yeah 

168.07 172.10 A: because i have um two thirteen year (( olds )) and a seventeen year old 

172.85 174.99 B: oh so they are they are right in the system right now 

173.00 173.40 A: so 

175.10 183.33 A: right right and they don't they don't particularly like going in and out of this double wide per se um they find it to be pretty funny to do that 

184.00 186.17 A: you know when they talk to other students who are 

184.32 184.77 B: (( temp- )) 

185.69 186.09 B: (( )) 

186.35 190.64 A: over the border in vermont and massachusetts i'm right on the border of both 

191.07 192.64 B: uh-huh now do they 

193.09 193.56 B: uh 

193.66 197.17 B: do does anybody complain about uh having the additions or not 

197.59 199.17 A: not not really 

197.64 198.95 B: is there any problem with testing 

199.53 201.84 A: not really at this point um 

200.36 200.65 B: no 

202.54 209.31 A: you know it's it is rarely that people go to the town meetings and complain but the things that they do complain about 

206.27 206.74 B: uh right 

209.91 213.72 A: are not the right things if that makes any sense 

213.16 215.07 B: yes it does do they 

215.95 216.73 B: when 

216.92 220.56 B: so you have trailers but you also have enough teachers to staff that that's 

221.17 224.01 A: yeah it is three three well one 

221.99 222.39 B: to hand- 

224.32 226.26 A: main teacher and two 

226.44 228.97 A: aides in the classroom so it is three to a ratio of 

229.15 235.55 A: sixteen so that's n- that is broken down pretty good yeah that is five students per one teacher 

230.82 232.82 B: that is wow that is very good actually 

232.91 233.35 B: yeah 

235.40 236.29 B: teacher yeah 

236.16 240.62 A: yeah so that is good ratios i mean i have no complaints about the academic 

240.96 241.37 B: mhm 

241.38 245.14 A: part of it and you know we have regular i._p. -s 

245.29 247.55 A: and things like that when the children need them 

247.88 249.56 A: you know according to their needs 

248.15 248.51 B: oh 

249.24 249.99 B: needs right 

249.89 252.29 A: so i don't have a complaint about that 

252.50 253.12 A: um 

253.50 254.46 A: the other things 

255.51 257.06 A: that i consider you know 

257.17 261.74 A: prioritizing is to provide more extracur- curricular activity 

262.11 263.79 B: well uh sports and 

262.12 262.67 A: um 

263.54 268.43 A: yes we only have field hockey basically and well basketball and soccer so three 

268.86 275.27 B: three do they do they do you guys charge an extra fee to for kids to participate in that or is it paid for by the town 

275.46 287.12 A: that is pretty much paid for by the town and then the parents um you know pay for the uniforms and all the equipment and things like that but i think again as i said before small towns um 

281.04 281.70 B: oh okay 

287.22 287.85 A: you know they are 

287.96 292.13 A: of course there's smaller things i've been to connecticut many times to the shoreline 

291.88 294.20 B: right yes oh well yeah 

292.64 293.99 A: and um i've 

294.30 294.62 A: is 

294.85 295.86 A: is it morgan 

295.97 296.74 A: high school 

296.94 297.69 A: in connecticut 

297.88 298.62 B: i don't know 

298.91 299.46 B: do do 

299.17 299.52 A: yeah 

299.79 302.88 B: there may be one um there's so many little towns here yeah 

302.28 304.09 A: right but it is phenomenal the 

304.36 307.31 A: the difference between high schools in connecticut 

307.78 308.16 B: uh-huh 

307.84 311.90 A: verses high schools over here in (( )) i live by the racetrack 

311.30 314.21 B: oh you live by the racetrack does that do you get revenue from 

314.33 317.31 B: the town do you get any revenue from the racetrack for schools or anything 

316.05 323.20 A: actually we do and the lottery the lottery helps out with a lot of thing but it is fun 

323.35 326.54 A: are steadfast and true about what they believe in because 

326.71 337.28 A: living in a small town you have that person's mother whose mother went to that school whose mother taught in that school you know and so on so it's people 

330.09 330.47 B: mhm 

334.00 334.66 B: oh wow 

337.55 338.43 A: are stuck 

339.44 341.53 A: in what they believe are traditional ways 

341.48 342.30 B: (( )) 

341.75 343.17 A: and they won't come out of the rut 

343.69 345.21 A: do you know what i mean 

343.74 344.25 B: oh 

344.72 347.12 B: yeah i know exactly what you mean (( )) 

346.36 347.07 A: so 

347.35 349.03 B: yeah here we have the casinos 

349.36 350.98 A: oh yeah like (( foxworth )) 

349.64 350.47 B: uh yeah but 

351.24 353.21 A: (( foxworth )) and the (( mohican )) sun 

351.36 352.07 B: yeah 

353.38 354.78 B: that is right both of them 

354.02 354.99 A: right 

354.89 356.06 B: yeah and 

356.36 360.46 B: you know (( )) they do give some money to the state but you know what else they bring in 

359.03 359.47 A: right 

360.79 363.06 B: uh the trouble they bring in you know 

363.19 366.60 B: isn't really conducive for learning in the schools 

365.26 365.72 A: right 

366.31 367.29 A: right 

366.84 369.45 B: uh but yeah the money uh (( )) here because 

369.83 371.11 B: connecticut and i don't know if 

371.32 375.33 B: new hampshire has this problem but there where there are heavy deficits right now 

375.59 376.24 A: oh yeah 

375.98 378.71 B: uh in the state budget so they are looking to cut 

379.09 381.78 B: and of course the first thing they are cutting are uh 

381.92 385.04 B: social services and schools 

385.15 386.36 A: which are greatly needed 

385.16 385.82 B: and 

386.60 387.00 B: right 

388.27 388.76 B: uh 

389.14 389.69 B: but 

389.87 391.22 B: it's it's it's very interesting 

391.40 393.23 B: i i i i find that that 

393.50 394.35 B: a lot of people here 

394.96 396.92 B: don't want their taxes raised but they want 

397.55 398.04 B: they want 

398.29 399.96 B: the the schools to be the best 

400.02 400.99 A: right 

400.71 401.17 B: and (( )) 

401.46 406.28 B: and it is very difficult to to balance that esp- especially in a in a place 

406.43 406.88 B: uh 

407.33 409.66 B: that supposedly has the highest per capita income 

409.84 410.69 A: that is right 

409.93 416.73 B: but that's just be- yeah but that is just because of all of the wealthy people down by the new york border 

416.20 417.01 A: oh yes 

417.47 423.57 B: yeah so so without the ta- do you do you have that problem (( )) with new hampshire their taxes affecting your school system or 

423.62 425.85 A: well teachers' salaries have been cut 

423.92 424.57 B: i mean the (( )) 

424.85 425.41 B: deficits 

426.15 426.51 B: mhm 

426.63 427.31 A: which 

427.85 430.36 A: of course the turnover is very great now 

430.74 431.13 B: mhm 

438.21 438.65 B: right 

439.38 447.18 A: it might be a mother and then her daughter goes to the school and she grows up and she has a daughter and so forth and so they try to stay in the school system 

447.49 447.91 A: you know 

448.07 450.77 A: there is quite a few teachers that um 

448.42 448.94 B: right 

451.62 455.08 A: have been there for many years but now they are realizing they can't afford 

455.26 456.61 A: just the cost of living 

456.97 457.62 A: anymore 

457.94 461.92 B: yeah i have i have friends in massachusetts that w- that what they are doing the they used to be 

462.13 464.06 B: buy supplies for their students because they 

464.25 465.74 B: they didn't have the budget for 

466.10 474.16 A: oh yeah that is what they are doing over here too you know they will go to staples we a lot of teachers have found avenues to go down such as um 

466.60 467.29 B: (( )) yeah 

475.42 476.04 A: you know 

476.96 478.48 A: how do i say this um 

479.34 482.11 A: going around to different area businesses such as staples 

481.33 483.08 B: right and getting donations yeah 

482.23 490.41 A: and asking for donations you have probably seen them on the commercials on t._v. where um they give a certain percentage of everyone of your staples purchases 

485.43 486.34 B: yeah i have 

486.65 487.19 B: yeah 

490.57 491.21 B: yeah 

491.01 492.10 A: towards you know 

492.22 495.46 A: things like that um we do a lot of the soup labels you know 

495.72 497.26 B: oh the campbell's soup labels type of thing 

496.61 500.08 A: right to help out with education um 

497.40 498.26 B: yeah 

500.19 502.81 A: there is many different charities that we can 

503.06 503.46 A: you know 

503.86 504.59 A: help with 

503.91 504.54 B: yeah it 

505.03 511.72 B: yeah but the thing (( )) it is great that they do that and but a lot of our uh people or people i i know that our our opinion is that 

512.08 513.85 B: the- they should not have to shell that out 

513.97 521.52 B: uh it should be but it it should be covered by you know the the the city or town but of course like like your swimming pool 

514.11 514.75 A: i know 

521.63 522.64 B: thing (( )) 

522.23 523.48 A: (( )) 

522.78 527.62 B: (( )) other priorities seem to win or other people's agendas seem to to win 

527.75 528.48 B: (( )) 

527.83 531.45 A: oh that is so funny because i can't believe that a pool 

531.81 532.16 B: mhm 

534.92 535.36 B: right 

541.63 543.14 B: right yes 

542.47 547.72 A: so they had to kind of prioritize did they want the children off the street you know to to um 

546.47 546.81 B: mhm 

547.84 549.95 A: draw them towards the summer camp 

550.19 551.23 B: oh yeah
