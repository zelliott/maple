79.46 84.81 B: um and the next one down from it only teaches something like forty

89.19 103.12 A: [mn] you know i've been trying to study japanese on my own for oh years and years [laughter] [laughter] but you know it's a difficult language to take up without a tutor i must say [laughter] 

94.59 96.37 B: really [laughter] 

102.50 110.86 B: yeah it's kind of tricky i've been studying it for oh probably four years now and i'm not fluent or anything i c- [mn] 

110.40 111.74 A: have you been to japan 

111.67 113.21 B: um i've spent

118.39 126.47 B: and so i had the day to look around and i stayed in a hotel for the night and it was a lot of fun [laughter] i didn't want to leave 

125.21 126.00 A: i 

126.17 130.68 A: my my husband and i took a vacation there a couple of years ago we spent two weeks 

130.60 143.56 A: living in a little business hotel in iria ah [mn] where we were the [mn] only english speakers probably for [lipsmack] i don't know five square miles [laughter] we had a great time and and the japanese were so friendly and 

130.84 132.09 B: really 

138.42 139.70 B: wow 

143.35 156.34 A: oh it was it was just such a wonderful experience i know if you get a chance to to spend more time there you're just going to love it especially being able to actually speak the language you know other than just you know a few phrases here and there [laughter] like us 

150.86 151.83 B: (( ahah )) 

152.39 153.45 B: (( ahah )) 

154.88 160.28 B: yeah i've got some work to do yet i'm still in the basics [laughter] 

159.26 166.08 A: [laughter] well um [mn] are you familiar with the affirmative action program since i guess that's what we're supposed to speak about but 

165.56 170.12 B: i know i'm i'm really not too familiar with it um [lipsmack] 

170.55 172.94 B: what do you know about it [laughter] 

172.57 174.13 A: (( um [mn] well [mn] )) 

174.94 178.64 A: i don't think that i've ever really been affected by it even though 

178.78 187.68 A: as a woman in the workforce i i was an accountant for the general electric corporation whenever we lived in chicago illinois by the way right now i live in northern georgia 

187.76 200.57 A: in a little dinky farm town [laughter] but um what even though as a woman i am considered a minority as far as i know the affirmative action statutes really touch upon 

189.76 192.09 B: i see [laughter] 

200.52 203.45 A: race instead of gender status 

203.57 212.85 A: so being a white female i really [laughter] never knew that much about it i i never really thought about it in relation to myself 

203.60 204.56 B: (( ahah )) 

212.70 215.71 B: yeah well my 

213.79 214.79 A: so 

215.94 227.25 B: my experience is maybe a little different while i was in high school i didn't work i just went to school but now that i'm here in america and i'm an international student there's quite a lot of restrictions 

222.05 222.80 A: (( mm )) 

227.12 235.56 B: i'm only um well i'm on an f. two visa which is a student visa and with that i am allowed to work on campus 

232.18 232.93 A: mhm 

235.47 248.66 B: um during the time yeah i'm only allowed to work on campus and i have to keep my hours below twenty hours per week and that's i have to also be taking full time study 

236.00 237.08 A: that's all 

238.33 239.02 A: oh 

249.64 255.05 A: that sounds difficult from a financial point of view [laughter] 

252.82 254.34 B: yeah [laughter] 

254.61 258.89 B: well somewhat you can just hope for a scholarship i suppose 

259.00 261.99 A: yeah i i know that there is um 

262.34 263.73 A: well maybe 

264.00 277.08 A: maybe not in well i don't know if you're actually working in a computer lab you might have felt some of the backlash against h. one b. visa holders my husband is a software engineer for sun microsystems and 

276.46 277.49 B: okay 

277.22 283.06 A: there are a lot of um um especially indian people working in the united states 

283.07 289.54 A: um on visas and and there's a lot of um american disgruntlement about some of these foreign workers 

289.82 303.14 A: um you know it's the old well they're all taking jobs that americans could do but i'm i'm not sure if i believe that [laughter] but um you know there is there is some backlash and [mn] and i think that that is also [mn] 

297.04 298.25 B: yeah 

302.90 307.55 A: part of the problem and part of the controversy about the affirmative action program 

307.57 318.43 A: is that it said that people with less experience or talent are given jobs over those who might be more experienced or more talented simply because of their 

318.50 322.30 A: ah minority status whatever that status may be 

320.25 321.17 B: (( ahah )) 

322.10 330.91 B: yeah there's also i suppose the consideration there i i don't know what you've heard about um people with disabilities 

330.81 339.94 B: finding them jobs and things i mean there was once upon a time where people with disabilities were um basically 

340.27 347.54 B: placed in jobs like making broom handles and thinks like that just the sweat shop type thing 

344.28 345.28 A: mhm 

347.53 359.68 B: and today they're um getting people with disabilities a little further out there into the work force trying to get them better trained and giving them jobs that are more meaningful and 

358.44 364.69 A: [mn] [mn] well my aunt louise had epilepsy and even though that's you know 

364.79 378.35 A: a very easily controlled condition in her case um she was even though she was a college graduate was never able to find any kind of meaningful work because she did tell them you know i am epileptic 

378.09 379.49 B: yeah 

378.23 390.12 A: and then it would be like oh bye [laughter] you know but i- it was absolutely incredible because she is an extremely talented person i mean she graduated from art school i mean you know it's not like she was 

381.42 383.01 B: yeah 

385.59 386.57 B: uh-huh 

390.18 395.37 A: ah poorly educated or anything um but she finally just gave up and 

395.54 398.01 A: you know retired from the workforce completely 

397.92 400.95 B: it seems as though that is the case that 

400.84 407.35 B: um there are just so many stigmatisms about disabilities or just any kind of minority 

407.25 416.64 B: they carry stigmatisms um when it comes to employment and no matter how well they're trained they're it really does depend on the employer 

416.68 421.20 B: on what their feeling is towards that particular minority 

421.17 433.69 A: [mn] you know i i'll agree with that and and but the thing that bothers me about some of these federal [mn] statutes is that i don't really know if you can legislate people's minds to believe otherwise than they already do 

432.36 433.46 B: you really 

434.20 435.69 A: ah you know it's 

435.92 442.24 A: [sigh] i i i don't know it's like the legislation of morality does that really work you know 

442.20 454.74 A: and do we really want it to work [laughter] because whose morality but i mean in the c- i think in the case of like disabilities or you know and so on it's so clear cut to me that it's wrong to discriminate against someone 

442.30 443.28 B: (( can't )) 

444.52 446.42 B: yes exactly 

454.86 462.52 A: simply on a medical basis that has you know nothing to do with anyone outside of their own circle of loved ones 

461.82 463.04 B: yeah 

462.71 465.08 A: but i i really don't know if 

465.39 471.50 A: these statutes do much in their favor i i don't know you would have a lot more experience with that than i do 

471.59 475.21 A: i don't know how long affirmative action has been around i guess since the seventies 

475.15 476.15 B: (( mm )) 

476.30 477.25 A: [laughter] 

476.72 480.47 B: that would be my guess [laughter] at least 

478.72 485.76 A: [laughter] i mean have you have you had people tell you about it's easier now than it used to be or 

486.04 486.80 B: (( um )) 

486.80 496.49 B: it seems like they have a lot of government programs in now and particularly government organizations they want to take in people with disabilities which 

496.45 505.65 B: in a way well it's wonderful for people to have experience and things like that and to be given the opportunity to have jobs particularly if they haven't before 

505.39 506.33 A: mhm 

505.69 509.61 B: but i think there is kind of the danger of [mn] 

510.24 518.02 B: thinking that they're kind of taking people on board as a little project if they're not well trained or or things like that 

518.03 527.06 B: i think the main issue is making sure that people are trained and they're not sort of just being taken under the wing and ahah almost you know [laughter] 

525.92 528.33 A: yeah that seems kind of patronizing 

527.78 533.20 B: uh-huh exactly that is the word that i would be using i think 

533.32 539.53 A: that would be a difficult decision to make you know if i was in that position saying well you know 

539.72 552.48 A: thanks for the job but exactly why did you hire me [laughter] and and that that that's kind of a blow to the old self esteem to think oh you just took me on because i'm a number you needed to fill a slot you know 

543.27 544.87 B: yeah yeah 

552.23 554.96 B: yeah things really do start at a 

555.44 569.82 B: i think before the employment people just ah you know it's a grass roots thing that people need to be trained and need to be given the opportunity from the word go and i think especially ah they need to be taught 

569.84 571.32 B: (( um their )) 

571.44 577.44 B: capability and their capacity to do meaningful things in life 

578.14 584.15 A: [lipsmack] do you work with the blind or just anybody that falls into your program or 

583.75 585.88 B: um with well 

586.35 587.45 B: (( i )) 

587.58 599.89 B: let me think i do myself i'm a member of an organization called the national federation of the blind and so i have heard a lot of stories about things like that but my actual job right now um
