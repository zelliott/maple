12.53 14.24 B: terrible why is that 

14.56 18.36 A: uh because that eh insensitive eh 

18.52 22.68 A: insensitivity to discipline in public schools 

23.04 25.71 B: i would have to agree with you on that 

23.52 26.82 A: eh in my in my particular area i'm 

27.70 30.63 A: we have very much problems with the 

31.29 33.14 A: minority students basically 

33.70 36.31 A: and that they can't be chastised 

36.86 37.97 A: by teachers 

38.54 41.63 A: or any uh disciplinarians in the school 

42.23 45.29 A: if they're chastised right away there's almost a 

45.66 48.75 A: revolt by parents minority parents that they're being 

49.18 50.16 A: picked on 

51.26 52.89 A: has some very very 

54.35 56.53 A: bad situations where 

56.78 57.85 A: children's uh 

59.05 62.09 A: health has been very seriously injured 

62.42 63.52 A: can you hold on a while i have 

64.10 64.78 B: yeah go ahead 

64.12 64.74 A: front door 

65.46 66.35 A: hold on a second 

106.16 107.37 A: i'm sorry 

107.22 112.06 B: that's alright so you're uh it sounds like you're a teacher yourself then 

112.22 114.33 A: no defini- definitely not 

113.12 118.20 B: you know i wouldn't do that to myself actually 

117.00 119.07 A: you sound like a teacher 

118.71 119.23 B: me 

119.47 119.82 A: yeah 

120.34 121.69 B: uh actually i um 

121.86 122.62 B: no i'm not 

122.78 126.78 B: but i've got some good friends who are and i'm the uh education 

126.94 135.76 B: profession so uh we were just talking about this the other night how their school is so uh what's the word 

136.40 147.62 B: they're afraid of being sued to such an extent that uh they can't do anything any more um they had suggest one of them is a spanish teacher and her husband is an um 

140.97 141.67 A: right 

141.78 142.18 A: right 

147.77 159.66 B: he's a middle school science teacher and they were suggesting this field trip to spain uh that would be sponsored by the company and it would actually some of the money would go to the 

169.67 172.96 B: any territory that will get them sued so nothing 

173.31 173.64 B: can 

173.95 183.78 B: nothing extra curricular can be organized by the teacher you can't use anything that could be tied to the school so just the mere fact that the teacher knows the kids 

183.94 195.75 B: and that teacher got to know the kids through the class uh already suggest that that's where they met so if anything happened there's grounds there for suing the school 

195.97 199.25 B: yeah i would have to agree with you on that point there that uh 

199.38 203.76 B: the school systems screwed up like that there's uh 

202.10 207.82 A: well you can you can see there point in ways because they're being sue sued for millions and uh 

207.38 209.76 B: yeah it's ridiculous and they're and and they're losing 

209.94 210.47 A: yeah 

210.04 212.89 B: you know because you get these people who really 

210.86 211.28 A: yeah 

213.19 219.42 B: i just care about winning i don't know if the lawyers who just care about winning their case and hey i can argue anything and 

219.52 225.01 B: i don't know i i i think there's a level of discipline and uh responsibility 

225.38 228.32 B: that uh people are just trying to shun 

227.78 230.49 A: that's yeah basically at home 

231.32 235.94 A: good manners is good manners no matter what your race or ethnicity is 

231.57 232.52 B: though what the ew uh 

236.38 237.02 A: you know 

237.19 237.67 B: yep 

237.70 239.16 A: and it it shows through 

239.72 241.15 A: you either have them or you don't have them 

241.43 243.07 B: i agree with that 

243.31 245.27 B: yeah of course uh 

245.55 246.20 B: yeah 

246.61 249.28 B: definitely agree with that so what do you suggest could be done about it 

249.40 249.80 A: yep 

250.70 251.35 B: anything 

252.10 252.97 A: uh 

252.94 256.85 B: i've got no clue 

253.58 255.21 A: i that's eh 

255.99 260.28 A: well basically the government and and the schools and all 

260.67 264.53 A: parts of our government should stop being so 

265.69 268.78 A: over sensitive to politically correctness 

269.05 269.77 B: yep 

270.01 270.49 B: yep 

270.48 275.76 A: i think that uh they say you have the right to freedom of speech but you do not 

276.13 280.07 A: you can't express yourself if you express yourself in a eh uh 

280.19 281.65 A: in something that's uh 

282.87 286.22 A: uh well not 

286.37 292.15 A: with the the current trends then you're being a racist or you're being a 

291.83 292.86 B: a bigot 

292.56 293.90 A: yeah bigot 

293.02 299.38 B: uh something yeah yeah i would have to agree with that uh i think another problem 

294.75 295.56 A: yeah 

297.06 297.41 A: yeah 

299.58 300.24 B: uh 

300.35 303.06 B: with the public school systems i don't know is 

303.42 307.79 B: and this would be a tough one to solve is uh funding for it is 

307.90 319.79 B: only at the state level and uh it would be interesting uh i don't think this would solve things but it would be interesting if they some how were to tailor the 

320.92 322.83 B: to where ever you teach uh 

323.13 324.35 B: federally so that 

324.89 325.42 B: uh 

325.77 331.90 B: it's you know it'd have to be adjusted for living cost where you live but at the same time you get states with 

332.12 332.76 B: uh 

333.04 333.75 B: high 

334.00 335.29 B: student to 

335.76 338.71 B: adult ratio or what not states that 

339.23 346.50 B: it you get (( )) there's a huge uneven balance so you got states like uh utah which is where i'm from you have states like utah who 

346.95 347.69 B: um 

354.90 362.18 B: you get paid a lot better elsewhere it's hard to raise a family on a teachers salary it's a joke so if there was some what to combat that i think 

362.51 364.72 A: i don't i don't agree with 

365.21 369.24 A: also another problem i see i disagree with 

369.69 370.93 A: to a certain extent 

371.64 375.96 A: is like in our our school systems particularly in the philadelphia area 

376.94 379.56 A: the teacher gets paid by their education level 

379.95 382.04 A: no by the amount of work they do 

382.88 383.84 A: the 

384.16 388.72 A: the grade they teach or the subject they teach or the hardness of it 

389.03 389.53 A: whatever 

389.83 390.29 B: mhm 

390.35 395.92 A: the difficulty of it eh they can teach by their formal education if they 

397.04 400.40 A: keep going through their formal education it just brings up their 

401.57 402.46 A: their uh 

402.05 402.88 B: their salary 

402.59 403.68 A: pay salary 

404.01 404.51 B: mhm 

404.40 406.36 A: that i i i kind of not 

406.46 415.01 A: disagree with now if you're a common laborer now and you have been working in the in manor factory i think you should get paid higher than that 

416.03 419.31 A: uh fellow that's working out in the fresh air you know what i mean 

419.30 421.50 B: that's right 

419.89 425.21 A: the harder the the harder the job i think the the better the more you should be paid for 

429.03 434.14 A: yeah 

432.53 437.06 B: well it's been talking with you jim are we 

434.27 441.67 A: i i don't know i imagine there's still people doing it it has to be handled in that fashion 

441.30 443.29 B: probably 

443.46 446.43 B: uh that's funny 

445.35 448.62 A: the hand on bu- hands on business i guess 

448.95 449.91 B: that's right 

451.30 452.21 A: eh 

452.68 455.02 A: how did you uh become acquainted with this uh 

455.40 456.21 B: this system 

456.18 458.37 A: yeah this what's it called 

458.43 460.22 B: uh study survey 

460.55 461.08 A: yes 

460.61 462.17 B: i think it's a study 

461.72 462.17 A: yeah 

462.67 465.67 B: um i had a linguistics minor 

465.78 466.38 B: uh 

466.64 476.54 B: and i just recently graduated last summer and i still get the emails from our uh department linguistics department i asked to get the emails and so 

476.95 485.05 B: this is just one of the emails th- i guess it was sent out here from other people that they you know form professors that know each other in different universities so 

485.40 486.68 B: what about yourself 

487.10 489.66 A: i uh online i happened to it accidently
