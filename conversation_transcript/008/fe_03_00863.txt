35.96 36.31 B: hm 

38.98 39.83 B: do you 

39.65 39.96 A: yeah 

40.18 41.22 B: as a teacher 

41.38 42.39 A: well i i'm a 

42.64 45.52 A: staff development and and i'm the tech person for the district 

45.75 46.50 B: i see 

46.19 47.70 A: i also work with the special ed kids 

48.43 51.50 B: well i have put uh some children through public school i'm 

51.65 58.85 B: fifty nine years old so my children are all grown now but uh let me cut this television down just a second 

59.23 60.21 B: now um 

61.87 69.00 B: i i had some experience with public schools and some experience with private schools what's your opinion on what's wrong with them 

69.32 69.91 A: um 

70.21 72.92 A: uh money is the big thing right the big issue i think 

74.38 74.84 A: um 

75.17 77.51 A: i know here in missouri they're looking at 

77.75 79.01 A: serious cuts next year 

79.60 83.05 A: um round about three million for each district they're going to be losing 

84.86 85.96 A: i'm sure you know 

86.07 89.80 A: it it takes money to operate schools it takes money to find good teachers 

90.10 90.47 B: hm mhm 

90.66 92.00 A: cut that back you're you're cutting 

93.67 94.01 A: wrist 

95.23 96.82 A: that that's just my opinion um 

95.42 95.73 B: yeah 

97.84 100.65 A: i just think money runs the schools and if you cut the money then you 

101.19 106.29 A: you lose your good teachers they go on i know a lot of teachers that have gone on to other industries and uh 

107.02 108.71 A: careers just because there was no money in it 

110.55 112.03 A: a lot of good quality people that way 

112.63 113.15 B: uh huh 

123.32 128.23 B: when he became in governor of uh getting a lottery in alabama to help the public schools 

128.05 128.41 A: hm mhm 

129.00 133.07 B: but uh he won and then when he tried to put the lottery through he lost 

134.06 137.12 B: this is this is uh an area of the country we call the bible belt 

136.88 137.78 A: i understand 

137.80 143.30 B: a lot of religious people don't want gambling in the state and i i can understand their side and the other side as well 

143.29 143.63 A: hm mhm 

144.04 147.30 B: uh sort of in between as as far as how i think but 

154.46 156.59 B: then almost any other state i think miss- 

156.71 157.66 B: -issippi is below us 

158.45 167.08 B: and perhaps one or two other places but uh alabama is on the low end of the scale as far as the money per capita spent on children for their education 

167.48 171.72 B: so money is a big problem but we have another problem that i think is is almost as serious and that's 

171.82 172.46 B: the lack of 

172.56 173.06 B: uh 

174.10 177.65 B: lack of control uh or or 

178.03 181.80 B: maybe not the lack of control so much as the increase in violence 

182.42 184.11 B: and misbehavior in schools 

185.19 194.08 B: it seems to me and it's just an old man's opinion but it seems to me that um children nowadays are not as well behaved as they were when i was young 

193.90 194.48 A: i agree 

195.03 195.80 A: a lot of stuff that 

196.09 199.20 A: that that gets away that kids get away with right now 

217.99 218.35 A: hm mhm 

219.41 222.37 A: now do you think do you think that's just in urban areas do you think that 

219.57 219.88 B: and 

224.31 225.46 B: education in general 

225.70 228.90 B: the county that i live in baldwin county 

243.76 244.52 B: and uh 

256.67 257.28 B: per capita 

258.43 268.99 B: uh so it's it's not an urban problem anymore it's it's spread out into the suburbs and uh and the rural areas because in my opinion it's a lack of parental guidance 

269.35 271.90 B: uh and to some extent i blame the uh 

272.08 273.77 B: teachers to but uh 

273.97 274.93 B: parents mostly 

275.21 277.04 A: i i i agree a hundred per cent on 

277.17 277.45 A: i 

277.58 282.20 A: i'm i work like i said in it's a district in a it's just outside of kansas city so i guess you'd consider 

283.52 286.48 A: suburban school district actually it's it's on the fringe of uh 

287.33 288.13 A: a lot of farmland 

288.25 290.53 A: so you get a mixture plus there's uh uh 

291.31 292.69 A: military base close by 

296.95 298.88 A: call 'em transient but there not here for long 

300.77 305.38 A: but yeah we're we're having we're experiencing the same problem i thought it might ju- be inner city 

305.95 307.18 A: but no we're seeing it now 

308.03 310.24 A: suburbs and in the country as well around here 

311.07 311.50 A: um 

311.62 315.16 A: uh a lot of times they're expecting the teachers on i'm just looking this 

316.93 320.21 A: parents are expecting the teachers to be the parents as well 

330.13 334.36 B: what president's wife was it that wrote the book uh it takes a village 

335.11 335.89 B: wasn't that uh 

335.39 336.71 A: oh is uh 

337.44 337.86 A: clinton 

338.40 342.69 B: clinton's wife i thought it was i couldn't remember for sure but i didn't read the book but i heard 

342.85 346.05 B: a great many people talking about it and got the impression that the book 

352.85 360.81 B: and other authorities li- such as teachers should increase because uh parents aren't capable of teaching their children the correct morals and 

360.93 362.26 B: social graces 

362.70 363.18 B: um 

363.11 364.36 A: i don't believe that 

363.86 365.06 B: did you read the book 

364.77 366.59 A: no i haven't read the book but um i 

368.68 370.15 A: the basis for discipline and 

370.74 372.87 A: comes from the home and carries over to the 

376.20 377.88 A: the responsible parties for their kid 

389.82 397.26 B: ah even with our poor funding uh the teachers have done a grand job however we still have some teachers 

397.40 400.14 B: that i don't really want to be teaching my child morals 

400.67 402.33 B: they are uh you know 

401.93 406.47 A: i agree i und- i understand completely that maybe they have a different lifestyle and 

407.19 407.48 A: yeah 

409.73 414.59 B: don't even want my children in a room with them without other people being there you know what i'm saying 

414.52 415.69 A: i understand completely 

415.86 426.71 B: so i i i'm of the opinion that parental controls and parental authority and par- parental guidance is is the key to uh changing the problems of not only um 

427.24 428.52 B: good academics but 

428.67 431.56 B: the violence and so forth that's going on as well 

432.03 432.53 A: i agree 

432.88 436.08 B: and the country as a whole is 

436.31 442.25 B: gone downhill morally speaking spiritually speaking and uh that's just my opinion but 

442.43 443.51 B: i believe that's that's 

443.69 444.88 B: the basis behind it all 

446.00 447.70 B: do you feel that there's a solution 

448.30 450.23 B: for both the monetary and the 

450.96 452.09 B: the other problems we discussed 

453.15 456.60 A: no i mean i if there was a solution um 

457.10 457.84 A: i wish i knew it 

458.48 459.39 A: right now um 

459.77 463.28 A: our state is in a pinch um the economy is going down 

464.30 464.84 A: with that 

467.78 468.86 A: teacher are public servants 

469.72 471.94 A: and history shows that public servants 

475.19 476.51 A: so i don't foresee 

477.18 477.80 A: big increase 

485.10 485.68 A: secondary 

485.90 487.10 A: and that's usually 

488.29 492.95 A: females uh their husband has a good job so they don't really it it doesn't monetary 

493.98 495.67 A: aspect doesn't really matter for them 

496.56 497.12 A: um as 

497.29 498.59 A: far as the morals i don't know 

498.82 500.36 A: and i'm i'm with you i think 

502.76 503.33 A: sole 

503.69 505.76 A: take sole control and responsibility for 

506.26 507.41 A: i know when i was growing up 

508.23 511.03 A: we got in trouble at school we were in double trouble when we got home 

513.19 514.26 A: teachers were backed up 

514.74 516.55 A: by the parents and i don't think they are right now 

516.84 526.12 B: no in fact i've seen k- situations and it's very widespread i think where children get in trouble at school and the parents blame everybody but the child 

526.87 527.25 A: exactly 

543.38 545.94 A: particularly when they know that the the kids can run home
