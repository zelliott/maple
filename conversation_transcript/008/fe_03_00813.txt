74.51 74.77 A: uh 

97.83 98.34 A: yeah

160.35 161.12 A: oh ok 

173.08 173.68 A: uh huh 

174.47 175.36 A: yeah if it it goes

208.15 208.86 A: oh 

208.96 210.33 A: i haven't done the survey yet 

211.98 212.49 A: so this is 

213.11 214.85 A: a strange experience 

219.30 220.87 A: right yeah i know what you're saying 

223.24 226.13 A: no i kept getting calls but i never caught it on time 

237.68 240.29 A: oh so they've g- have a hard time connecting to people 

256.56 257.07 A: yeah 

258.19 259.95 A: so i don't how long does this survey last 

264.30 264.98 A: oh ok 

269.68 270.19 A: uh huh 

276.15 276.47 A: yeah 

280.00 281.56 A: oh nothing like this before 

282.92 283.82 A: i don't even know what it's 

283.91 284.30 A: for

295.08 296.52 A: oh gosh i don't know i just 

297.13 298.43 A: i've done a few 

299.20 299.95 A: uh 

300.17 301.65 A: greenfield i think has a 

301.79 302.72 A: survey site 

304.91 305.40 A: i i 

305.82 307.06 A: i haven't really done very many

319.21 320.44 A: oh my gosh 

322.39 323.05 A: wow 

324.17 324.91 A: that would be nice 

328.22 330.38 A: i think that would be very time cons- consuming though 

335.59 337.07 A: oh was it an elderly lady 

353.21 353.94 A: no no 

359.32 359.76 A: uh huh

380.05 380.41 A: huh 

384.07 384.53 A: uh huh 

392.42 392.92 A: uh huh 

397.80 398.34 A: no 

405.79 406.27 A: yeah 

406.51 408.44 A: oh fam- b- familiarity 

410.05 410.93 A: valuable than money 

420.64 421.12 A: exactly 

432.13 432.62 A: yeah 

443.27 444.98 A: yeah i try to avoid it 

446.11 446.65 A: yeah 

447.23 447.53 A: doesn't 

447.69 448.16 A: really 

449.19 449.74 A: uh 

450.79 451.89 A: help my day to 

452.17 453.57 A: to focus on it so 

460.87 461.35 A: sure 

461.98 462.47 A: right 

471.02 472.39 A: so what's good to eat in atlanta 

473.12 473.65 A: any good res- 

478.92 480.25 A: oh just about anything 

480.63 481.15 A: southern 

481.48 481.92 A: cooking 

515.09 515.84 A: (( )) 

517.07 517.47 A: oh 

533.38 533.70 A: huh 

536.41 536.77 A: yeah 

31.15 32.05 B: so 

32.28 34.59 B: what if we what if you could go back in time 

45.70 48.02 B: you know i i think i would probably 

48.85 52.03 B: go back a little further than that and really relive high school 

53.51 54.78 B: i think that's what i'd do 

56.32 56.98 B: and 

58.65 60.55 B: they said what what would you do differently 

61.96 63.12 B: i would probably 

63.59 67.01 B: i'm a musician and i studied music when i was in high high school 

67.82 69.71 B: i started going to this uh 

71.45 72.97 B: it's called the alabama school 

73.08 74.11 B: school of fine arts 

74.60 75.35 B: in alabama 

75.89 76.86 B: very good school 

77.84 82.77 B: a lot of my friends who went there were national merit scholars they went to princeton duke yale 

83.57 85.24 B: and uh i think i'd probably 

85.54 86.25 B: go there 

87.91 88.64 B: because 

89.93 91.99 B: i didn't get along very well with the uh 

92.23 93.76 B: with one of the teachers that i had 

94.12 95.04 B: so i left 

95.78 97.65 B: and i kind of wished that i had stuck it out 

98.56 98.97 B: now 

99.91 101.93 B: so i i'd go back and do that differently 

109.52 112.44 B: yeah and then i'd i'd well college i think i'd 

113.13 116.01 B: i'd be more serious because i did i graduated 

117.21 120.36 B: kind of by the skin of my teeth i got serious in my senior year 

122.16 124.09 B: i did very well in high school 

125.71 128.80 B: but college was just kind of a joke when i first got there 

129.59 132.66 B: and i think i'd go back and be more serious there as well 

135.10 136.79 B: i'd actually try to learn more 

136.99 138.72 B: you know rather than just making the grade 

141.20 141.74 B: yeah 

142.02 143.87 B: i think that's what i what i really 

144.67 145.38 B: want to do 

147.77 149.41 B: so how long ago were you in school 

155.47 157.85 B: well i've got you beat 

158.46 160.17 B: i graduated in eighty six 

162.24 163.68 B: so that's been 

164.13 166.72 B: seventeen years i hadn't even thought about that 

167.56 170.57 B: i maybe i shouldn't have asked that question 

170.84 173.11 B: i probably should have stayed away from that 

177.26 180.81 B: it really does and you know what i haven't even thought about how long i've been out 

182.61 185.10 B: excuse me i'm i'm having lunch actually 

186.16 188.65 B: on my cell phone i'm at a restaurant 

189.76 190.88 B: in atlanta georgia 

191.93 193.41 B: and uh where are you 

196.01 197.58 B: oh okay you know this one (( )) 

197.77 198.56 B: a some a 

198.99 200.33 B: study for southerners 

201.12 203.50 B: because everybody the people that i've spoken with 

204.23 207.97 B: one lady was from was from virginia somebody else was from tennessee 

215.77 217.92 B: you said well when i say survey i mean 

218.27 219.55 B: the phone conversation 

221.79 223.24 B: you said you haven't done one yet 

226.79 227.69 B: oh ok 

228.57 231.13 B: well normally they have a hard time getting people 

231.88 235.91 B: to participate it seems like it's been going on forever it seems like i get calls like 

236.43 237.79 B: all day everyday 

240.38 241.58 B: yeah i mean 

241.91 243.31 B: once they call me 

243.70 244.44 B: and they say 

245.18 248.30 B: hold just a moment while we locate someone else for you to talk to 

249.08 250.61 B: and they never can't find anybody 

253.13 253.61 B: so uh 

255.07 256.45 B: that's kind of the way it's been 

260.46 261.33 B: are we supposed to 

261.70 264.13 B: talk i believe if i'm not mistaken for ten minutes 

265.13 267.30 B: and it's going to cut us off it's going to tell us 

267.84 269.47 B: to wrap up the conversation 

271.10 271.95 B: and uh 

273.93 274.44 B: you know 

274.56 275.86 B: and and go from there 

276.80 279.92 B: so have you done these before have you done surveys such as this 

285.31 288.99 B: well i mean not necessarily like this but i mean online surveys and uh 

292.66 294.93 B: which ones have you found to be the best ones 

302.75 303.34 B: hm mhm 

308.36 311.05 B: the lady i talked to the other day had done quite a few 

312.95 314.37 B: she was like an old pro 

316.70 318.97 B: she told me she makes about two fifty a month 

320.48 321.98 B: just on the side doing 

323.43 324.01 B: yeah 

325.34 326.99 B: yeah that's what i said too 

331.38 335.47 B: well that's what i thought too but she says it actually doesn't take her that much time to do it 

337.74 338.57 B: um 

338.90 339.68 B: not really 

340.27 342.32 B: she was still working she was 

343.51 344.61 B: i think maybe 

344.97 346.99 B: based on what the way she was talking 

347.25 348.82 B: sounded like she was in her forties 

349.36 350.12 B: or fifty 

351.65 353.25 B: i don't consider that elderly 

355.07 356.16 B: yeah so 

356.48 358.95 B: i mean she still works 

360.24 360.80 B: for sure 

361.37 362.05 B: can i get a refill 

364.58 365.07 B: so 

366.33 367.69 B: yeah it's it's been 

367.96 369.05 B: interesting though 

370.30 371.26 B: to do these things 

372.87 374.83 B: one of the topics i had was 

375.69 379.69 B: uh what if you got a m- what if you were offered a million dollars to leave the country 

381.48 383.99 B: and i guess never return that's what i'm assuming 

384.32 384.72 B: thank you 

386.87 389.68 B: so i and of course both of us responded 

390.24 392.39 B: by saying that we probably wouldn't 

394.23 395.99 B: i wouldn't leave for a million dollars not 

396.54 397.77 B: not if i couldn't come back 

401.49 403.64 B: i think it i don't know how much it would take 

403.82 405.70 B: or i don't know if i'd leave for any amount 

412.43 416.71 B: you got that right especially in in light of as as the lady i was talking to said 

417.33 419.28 B: with all the stuff going on in the world 

422.56 427.51 B: i mean this is com- this is unreal this this stuff the things that we're experiencing now 

428.59 429.74 B: i never would have thought 

430.52 431.96 B: that i would live to see this 

437.23 438.41 B: it seems like every time i 

438.60 440.35 B: turn the radio or the t._v. it's 

440.85 443.53 B: there's something else and it's usually not good news 

445.32 445.99 B: oh really 

454.03 455.01 B: well that's true 

455.64 457.37 B: and i'm i'm really the same way i 

457.92 460.68 B: but you know when you're in the car and you you listen to the radio you 

460.86 461.88 B: you almost can't 

462.86 464.17 B: you can't avoid it i mean 

466.06 469.52 B: i don't focus on it but i listen to it see what's going on and you know 

473.54 474.03 B: uh 

475.56 478.91 B: the good restaurants what what type of cuisine what type of food
