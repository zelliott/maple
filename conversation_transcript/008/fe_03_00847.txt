71.18 72.11 B: oh good you found it 

73.62 75.92 A: uh we got a hard topic it seems like doesn't it 

75.97 76.35 B: well 

77.24 81.05 B: i we- i guess you know i i just yesterday's topic was 

81.17 82.15 B: time travel 

82.26 83.89 B: you know and and so to me this 

82.36 82.82 A: uh huh 

84.16 85.18 B: seems easier 

85.34 87.44 A: yeah time travel is sort of weird 

86.91 87.42 B: yeah 

87.92 88.29 A: hm 

88.43 90.20 B: but oh i think what they 

90.54 92.60 B: what they talk about was like if you would 

93.82 97.59 B: could go back in time and change one thing what would it be 

97.85 98.15 B: but 

99.34 102.58 B: you know just thinking about the topic for a minute i was thinking 

103.68 105.05 B: i think that to me 

105.23 106.94 B: friends would be more important than money 

107.81 109.67 A: yeah they did say best friend didn't they 

109.57 109.94 B: yeah 

110.07 111.72 A: oh it that'd be sort of rough 

111.91 112.33 B: yeah 

112.89 113.29 A: hm 

114.36 119.97 A: i don't know i i guess i would stick with the friend also i think but it's pretty tempting though 

119.47 123.88 B: yeah that's true a million dollars is a lot and you can do a lot of good with a million dollars but 

125.01 127.74 A: yeah that was your very best friend especially if you don't have many 

127.98 128.89 A: very good friends 

128.01 128.35 B: right 

129.49 130.84 A: they're hard to come by so 

130.51 130.78 B: that's 

130.91 131.19 B: true 

131.80 132.17 A: huh 

132.29 134.03 B: and it in you know sometimes 

134.62 135.08 B: you think 

135.25 136.11 B: money would be 

136.60 139.65 B: there's some people where i live that won the lottery 

140.37 140.69 A: uh 

140.75 143.21 B: and they won about two million dollars i think probably about 

143.55 144.47 B: years ago and 

145.51 150.12 B: you know i don't think they seem any happier than they were when they didn't have as much money 

150.64 157.34 A: it's probably true they had a big article in a paper about er magazine about all the people that won the lottery and had misery after that 

150.83 151.12 B: so 

157.40 157.90 B: yeah 

157.65 160.62 A: they went bankrupt they lost their their spouses and 

158.76 159.31 B: yeah 

160.90 165.88 B: and they you know i think you it hard it'd be hard to trust people if you had that money you know 

166.53 167.76 B: you you losing 

167.88 171.34 B: the best friend that you have because you can't talk to them anymore 

171.60 176.93 B: you you couldn't really trust the people that want to be your friend cause you don't know if they want to be your friend for you or 

175.53 178.49 A: yeah there's so many scam artists around too 

178.40 178.92 B: right 

178.76 181.02 A: they smell the money if you got money you know 

179.92 180.33 B: yeah 

181.70 181.99 B: true 

182.38 185.68 A: i was out i worked in wisconsin for s._b._a. 

185.89 186.45 B: (( )) 

185.94 190.96 A: deal with the indians when i was out there i forgot how long ago some school teacher won 

187.54 187.84 B: oh 

191.38 191.97 B: oh wow 

191.89 194.47 A: and he gave his fiancee half the ticket 

194.76 197.67 B: yeah and then they broke up didn- yeah i remember that 

195.65 200.64 A: yeah that was funny and then he tried to sue her to get it back and he lost in court 

200.51 201.05 B: yeah 

201.27 202.84 A: so 

201.69 203.24 B: so it i think money would do 

203.36 204.64 B: strange things to you and 

205.00 206.62 B: did you ever see that movie um 

210.00 210.98 B: (( )) or something 

211.11 211.80 A: demi moore 

211.91 213.07 B: yeah where she 

213.59 215.39 B: and woody harrelson was in it and 

215.07 216.18 A: right right 

215.75 216.74 B: they were you know 

217.78 220.66 B: all she had to do was sleep with the the guy and then she was going to get 

219.49 221.27 A: for a million dollars 

221.07 221.57 B: yeah 

221.69 222.67 B: but then even 

223.20 226.20 B: you know they thought oh this'll be good we'll have a 

226.42 230.20 B: million dollars and we're going to start out our lives together and stuff and then their whole life 

231.27 231.77 A: yeah 

231.88 233.27 B: and it's just a movie but 

233.68 237.57 A: so many people talked about that though what was the uh other 

235.31 235.77 B: yeah 

237.92 240.23 A: actor in there the famous actor i forget who it was 

240.29 240.78 B: um 

240.94 242.14 B: i think it was paul newman 

242.47 243.76 B: wasn't it er or 

244.37 246.44 A: no paul newman was too old i think 

247.17 247.65 A: i forget 

248.33 249.59 A: anyway it was a good movie 

249.56 250.04 B: yeah 

249.93 252.89 A: and people talked about it for a long time 

252.19 252.63 B: yeah 

252.98 258.82 B: i i thought i would do it but i i don't think i would i just used to joke about it but 

258.92 259.33 A: uh huh 

259.91 261.52 B: you know quite honestly i 

261.75 266.89 B: i truly believe in my heart that if if i had to make that choice i probably would say no cause 

267.57 269.50 B: right now my best friend is my husband and 

269.64 272.20 B: i know that i wouldn't want to not talk to him so 

272.81 273.30 A: right 

273.75 275.43 A: it'd probably ruin your marriage really 

274.99 277.00 B: yeah a little 

277.34 280.49 B: and what and what good would money do if you can't share with the person 

279.69 282.42 A: of course you know some people wouldn't care uh 

282.76 288.45 A: i don't know if you follow computer stuff but on ebay oh two weeks ago some guy tried to sell his wife and his two kids 

288.45 289.23 B: you're kidding 

289.48 290.24 A: you didn't hear about that 

290.19 290.95 B: no 

290.87 291.72 A: he put a bid in 

291.89 292.79 B: oh my god 

292.56 299.09 A: but what happened ebay turned him down they made him get off cause they they had a rule they wouldn't let anybody sell other people 

297.84 299.55 B: (( )) 

299.88 301.74 A: but they had it all set up that's the big thing 

299.94 300.51 B: (( )) 

301.86 302.83 B: oh my god 

302.79 304.03 A: yeah well they 

303.50 305.22 B: how could you even think about that 

305.23 307.15 A: i don't know for money i guess 

306.87 307.72 B: oh man 

307.87 309.88 A: they did sell a town in california on ebay 

310.12 311.49 B: really and did and 

310.69 311.09 A: yeah 

312.14 314.76 B: but with the whole wife thing did she know he was doing that 

314.90 315.81 A: yeah they agreed to it 

316.05 316.80 B: oh 

316.79 319.82 A: he had a wife and two kids i guess seven and eight years old something like that 

319.91 323.33 B: um like that he was going to sell them permanently or just rent them out or 

323.90 324.69 A: i guess 

325.02 331.14 A: totally rent them the whatever the guy wanted to do with the family where they move and all this they'd even change their name except for the kids 

331.48 332.11 B: wow 

332.06 334.65 A: the guy is sort of a crackpot i guess 

332.82 333.20 B: wow 

334.49 335.25 B: i guess 

335.45 338.16 B: well (( )) think of the wife to go along with that 

335.56 336.07 A: there's 

338.54 340.14 A: uh she liked money too probably 

339.85 340.65 B: uh maybe

348.78 349.15 B: yeah 

349.48 350.99 B: that doesn't count 

350.52 353.09 A: in fact i might even give her away 

352.33 354.36 B: everybody wants that i think 

354.79 355.78 B: that's just a given 

355.88 356.74 A: yeah that's true 

357.05 359.87 A: no she's nice half the time but 

360.00 360.58 A: she's 

360.87 361.18 B: (( )) 

360.90 362.31 A: not my wife no 

362.72 366.14 A: it we were for married for twenty something years already too it's a big investment

368.30 368.71 A: really 

369.18 369.92 A: oh great

379.10 379.87 B: that is fast 

380.17 385.14 A: yeah we never should have got married we should have broke up before that but the family her family sort of pushed us and 

385.23 385.79 B: yeah 

385.93 387.08 A: big mistake 

386.63 388.09 B: my brother did that too i think 

388.31 388.74 A: really 

389.25 391.09 B: so he got married real fast 

391.19 392.14 B: cause and he 

392.42 400.67 B: he said to me i he remembered that when they were getting married that he said to my dad i don't think this is right i shouldn't be doing this and my dad said just be quiet and go get married 

403.08 403.40 B: so 

403.20 404.83 A: yeah big mistake you pay for it

409.92 411.97 A: is that it we just talk a little bit and then 

411.48 415.72 B: uh yeah i think we just talk and then i'm assuming there'd be a cutoff or something
