17.61 18.07 A: okay 

17.68 21.18 B: like i wasn't away of that before so 

20.53 22.46 A: so we'll time it this time right 

22.08 24.62 B: yup i think supposedly it the 

24.85 25.18 B: the ah 

25.35 25.70 B: the 

26.05 30.23 B: automatic voice thing comes on and tells you when it's up so 

29.13 35.66 A: okay this is interesting okay good so is there something that you would change 

35.82 38.52 A: if you or what would you change if you could go back in time 

38.83 40.18 B: um 

40.55 41.29 B: i guess if 

41.91 45.12 B: there's not many things that i would change i'm really happy with my life but 

45.32 48.25 B: if i had to name something i'd probably um 

49.35 54.13 B: have perused a different career path like i always wanted to be a teacher 

54.55 56.42 B: and i wish i had done that 

56.87 60.54 B: but um i went for computers instead and i kind of regret that so 

61.22 61.86 A: oh how long 

61.37 61.78 B: i guess 

62.15 62.65 A: oh go on 

63.30 63.99 B: i'm sorry go ahead 

64.04 66.35 A: (( )) how long have you been in the computer business then 

66.27 70.61 B: um about two or three nows and i kind of realized that 

70.92 74.33 B: like i knew i guess i knew form the start that i always wanted to teach and i 

74.50 78.68 B: let people talk me out of it but i'm learning now to be 

79.51 82.97 B: i don't know just to do what i want to do and follow my dreams you know 

83.77 87.48 B: so um you know it's not to late to go back and do that but 

88.15 93.01 B: and you invest like so much time and money into it i kind of regret that but 

93.54 93.81 A: but 

93.91 98.15 A: at least it's nice that you realize that at least you can go back and you sound young enough that uh 

98.71 99.66 A: could definitely do that 

99.95 103.23 B: yeah definitely i mean i'm uh like twenty four 

103.48 106.83 B: twenty three so i'm young enough to be able to do it 

103.61 104.09 A: oh 

104.93 105.36 A: hey 

107.27 116.29 B: but um i'm still paying off my previous student loans so i'm not going to be able to do it right away i'll be paying those off for ten years so 

115.79 122.22 A: oh well see (( )) that's that's not too bad though i mean i took a twenty 

120.48 121.30 B: yeah 

122.44 125.83 A: for almost a twenty five year absence from college so 

126.46 130.41 A: ah so you can do it at any point i'm just now going back 

130.41 131.89 B: oh are you what are you going for 

130.98 131.37 A: yes 

131.88 133.49 A: um dental hygiene actually 

133.79 134.85 B: oh that's great 

133.96 135.85 A: so that was that's what i would (( )) 

135.95 140.02 A: if i could go back in time i would actually i started the program actually when i was 

140.38 142.09 A: eighteen and i'd 

142.23 146.43 A: just finish it instead of dropping out and doing other things 

146.24 146.91 B: right 

146.59 149.17 A: (( )) smart move but uh 

148.87 151.53 B: why did you uh stop doing it 

151.78 158.10 A: that's a good question why did i not want to do that i heard it had a high (( )) rate 

158.87 159.35 A: it 

160.29 166.62 A: and i think (( )) that my husband was a (( )) so i decided to go ahead and pursue other things 

166.05 172.42 B: but yeah you just got to got for what you want 

168.37 168.74 A: but 

171.91 173.54 A: that's exactly yeah 

173.01 177.70 B: oh no so i guess it's a moot point so i guess (( )) 

177.74 178.09 A: yeah 

178.47 178.75 A: so 

178.85 180.78 A: i'm much better to yeah to 

181.02 182.18 A: follow your own heart as 

182.28 183.77 A: opposed to listening to somebody else 

183.95 185.18 B: exactly 

184.50 186.09 A: (( )) but uh 

191.57 194.27 B: great opportunity money you know and 

198.57 199.54 B: boom went 

199.83 207.40 B: down the toilet you know so you don't so you don't know what the future holds so you can't 

200.97 202.68 A: yes well 

207.58 209.86 B: base your decisions on you know 

210.18 215.86 B: trying to make money and you know i guess happiness is more important so 

214.98 218.21 A: i think happiness is more important yes (( )) 

217.37 218.01 B: oh 

218.36 221.42 A: to that leads to that is probably about uh 

221.93 222.90 A: route to take 

223.06 225.41 B: exactly 

226.40 227.95 A: been throat a lot and i i haven't 

229.93 231.81 B: god 

235.24 243.30 A: states united states or too the world but you know some sort of (( )) hypothetical i think that the only thing i think i could change was something that personally happened to me 

238.12 239.32 B: i know 

245.84 256.63 B: but um i don't know it's uh i guess it's not worth dwelling on at all you know can't change anything 

255.43 256.62 A: well yeah ri- ri- 

257.13 260.36 A: there's a little book that's called what if and it basically does 

260.77 262.82 A: talk about that you know 

263.83 265.57 A: go with the future i mean you can't keep 

265.83 269.11 A: comparing what you could have done if you want to change something then go ahead and do it 

269.56 270.72 A: (( )) there's always 

269.60 270.26 B: exactly 

271.76 274.73 A: time that don't regret some of the things you've done and just 

275.15 275.88 A: go from there 

276.14 277.94 B: exactly at least (( )) 

278.10 280.37 B: we would change there's something that we can 

281.37 284.16 B: you know actually change now you know what i mean 

282.78 283.14 A: yeah 

283.37 284.31 A: you that's true 

284.60 290.01 B: mhm so that's something to be really i don't know happy about i guess because 

290.99 291.57 A: yeah because i mean 

291.25 301.11 B: there's a lot of things that you can never go back and take away that you know people have done and they there's nothing they can do about it now but at least we can pursue what we want to do now 

301.13 305.55 A: so yes i didn't think about it that way but that's true but i don't think have the regrets 

304.00 304.61 B: mhm 

305.71 308.22 A: thank goodness on other things you know and your just 

308.35 310.13 A: certain that have passed away but i'd like 

310.26 314.49 A: those to not have happened but that's not something that i have in my power to have done anyway 

314.49 315.37 B: exactly 

314.66 315.66 A: to control it so 

316.45 317.00 B: exactly 

317.53 319.52 B: yeah so i'm learning that 

319.71 321.58 B: i guess i'm trying to learn (( you on that )) 

321.96 333.15 B: what's important in life you know i don't know it's hard you know to like figure out who you are and what you want to be and what you want to do with your life when you have it ahead of you so i'm trying 

332.53 336.30 A: um people tend to change careers a lot more often now then they ever did in 

337.23 338.63 B: you know that's true 

338.78 341.29 B: like i want to have i guess it's 

341.95 347.08 B: i don't know like right now it seems like all i wish i had done i wish i had done that but once i start a family and 

347.28 351.57 B: stuff like that i (( )) if i want it to be on and 

352.26 354.83 B: once i have those things maybe i won't mind so much 

355.18 357.74 B: you know work and things like that 

358.45 359.03 B: so 

359.22 361.55 A: yeah but just make sure that you 

361.76 362.53 A: you know 

363.97 364.64 A: well just 

364.78 365.32 A: yes 

365.66 368.65 A: hopefully it's a god situation 

367.30 371.06 B: i know well i'm getting married in june 

371.52 372.25 B: to like 

372.47 375.03 B: my soul mate i'm just crazy about him and 

374.52 375.07 A: oh 

375.51 378.87 B: we just get along so great and i feel like i have so much ahead of me 

379.38 381.20 B: like i just feel really lucky that i 

381.72 382.30 B: actually 

382.93 392.09 B: found something worth while and that i actually would want to marry because i've never cared about marrying or family before you know like of course but 

386.63 387.04 A: mm 

389.87 390.43 A: that's good 

392.37 394.65 B: you know i was always like oh you know uh 

395.53 399.93 B: independent woman go to work and stuff like that 

400.36 401.03 B: but um 

401.21 403.40 B: i guess i'm realizing that relationships are 

403.72 406.03 B: just as important as career 

406.22 408.97 B: things like that like your relationship with your family and your 

409.40 411.62 B: trying to make my relationship with my family 

411.93 412.63 B: good too 

412.83 413.63 A: mhm 

413.03 415.39 B: and you know and him and everything 

415.49 419.44 B: but i guess that's just as important as your career and all those other things 

419.89 420.60 A: well let's see 

420.12 420.55 B: i guess 

420.76 426.71 A: as they say on your death bed you don't usually look back on your life and say i wish i would have put in more hours at work 

425.71 428.67 B: i love that thing i do 

427.28 429.52 A: yes 

428.85 430.82 B: it's the truth 

430.32 431.81 A: it really yeah

446.86 450.04 B: they try though they do and they rally accept me and 

450.38 458.99 B: they really are good people at heart you know and i can't complain because i've heard horror stories about other in laws so

467.89 468.14 A: yup

479.97 480.52 B: you know
