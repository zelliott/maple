2.95 5.65 A: hi david my name's debra glad to meet you 

4.58 6.87 B: and i'm from idaho 

6.81 8.59 A: oh okay i'm in colorado 

8.28 10.07 B: okay um 

9.37 13.64 A: although i'm from pennsylvania where i guess this study is being done 

13.46 16.06 B: and i just moved down here from pennsylvania 

15.52 17.26 A: you did too what part 

16.19 20.33 B: my wife is from pennsylvania from philadelphia and we moved from the pocono's 

18.43 19.35 A: oh 

20.07 23.67 A: okay i was on the other side i lived ah near pittsburgh 

23.60 26.35 B: yeah i know guy that lived there in harrisburg area 

25.68 27.22 A: (( yeah )) 

27.34 29.70 A: okay well you want to go first 

28.99 31.72 B: yeah um how about you go first then i will 

30.71 37.98 A: [laughter] i'm not sure what if i was going to start a business what exactly i would do um 

38.15 40.37 A: i think it might be something like 

40.69 44.49 A: having to do with ah sewing and production of clothing 

44.84 46.12 A: um 

46.44 51.08 A: probably specifically kind of modest women's ware and children's ware 

50.94 51.82 B: (( uh )) 

52.46 59.00 B: okay and i when you say modest you mean more like in the long skirt type thing or 

58.98 60.64 A: yeah yeah 

59.78 61.68 B: okay okay 

61.86 62.68 B: um 

62.89 66.18 B: well i've given this a lot of thought myself actually because i 

65.41 66.65 A: you have okay 

66.42 75.21 B: i just got out of military so and it was kind of an idea to start my own business but i think i would probably go into the real estate business 

68.07 68.98 A: ah 

74.98 75.74 A: oh 

75.72 80.85 B: um due to the fact that there is a lot of people that are are in need of homes 

80.67 81.70 A: mhm 

81.26 90.47 B: and i think that i would use the cash that i had available to purchase homes for people that you know cannot purchase homes like you know they have bad credit or you know 

90.45 97.17 B: for some unforeseen thing they can't purchase homes i'll provide them a home you know and like on a lease option type purchase type thing and you know 

96.97 100.31 A: right that gives them a chance to get on their feet 

98.00 99.66 B: (( that right )) 

100.18 101.97 B: yep and i mean 

102.04 107.67 B: i've gone so far as you know to think in my head you know an architectural structure of my subdivision type thing you know 

107.12 112.08 A: oh yeah what kind of homes my dad was in construction my whole growing up years so 

110.23 111.04 B: (( oh )) 

112.06 121.42 B: i was thinking more of a type of a probably a three bedroom type bi-level home you know not duplex i don't want a duplex type but you know single homes you know 

116.37 117.35 A: uh-huh 

120.36 121.26 A: right 

121.75 128.70 B: and um not too many people living in the sub division you know kind of structured down but but and then you know like maybe a ah 

125.42 126.31 A: right 

129.30 131.29 B: like a church and a small shopping 

131.64 137.30 B: grocery store or something right in the subdivision so the people didn't have to you know go outside the subdivision to 

137.10 138.01 A: right 

137.47 139.19 B: do all that big stuff 

138.29 143.10 A: you'd like to make it more of a community rather than just a a h- housing development 

140.31 142.03 B: oh yeah yeah 

142.84 153.68 B: yep and to make sure that there's a service center on in the subdivision too that you know has like all the health and welfare benefit people and you know some- someone that knows all that stuff to help them out you know when they need their help so 

153.47 154.43 A: right 

154.56 157.44 A: well you've thought about this a lot it sounds like [laughter] 

156.77 162.78 B: well i have you know and you know it's about going to the s._p._a. and looking for you know funding i think so 

162.16 171.50 A: yeah now for me this you know the subject was it's not something i've given much thought to i had a little business of my own but it was just 

171.58 176.74 A: it was just me basically [laughter] doing some legal research and i had to set it up 

176.83 181.44 A: as a little business you know because i was um contract employed basically so 

178.66 179.44 B: uh-huh 

181.76 183.11 A: and that was sort of fun 

183.35 184.30 B: (( okay wow )) 

183.47 184.72 A: but my my 

185.12 187.56 A: only big customer um 

187.88 198.48 A: went automated well they didn't so much they al- already were but the court where i was doing work went automated so it didn't really need a body there any more they could get most of everything over the internet so 

193.11 194.05 B: oh 

198.22 199.03 B: (( yep the )) 

199.01 201.76 A: i was out [laughter] 

200.05 203.97 B: wonderful age of technology i guess a lot of people lose their jobs that way 

201.94 204.84 A: yeah it didn't break my heart or anything [laughter] 

204.20 206.96 B: yep i have that thought but um 

207.59 211.78 B: i guess the second part was do you think you will be successful i think 

214.48 215.39 B: hello 

215.14 216.13 A: yeah 

215.91 218.16 B: oh yeah i'm i'm asking if you 

217.01 218.21 A: i was waiting for you 

218.48 221.26 B: i'm asking do you think that you would be successful in that business 

220.49 225.14 A: oh that i would be um [laughter] i don't know i'm um 

226.68 227.82 A: (( oh i don't know )) 

227.91 235.46 A: i c- i've never thought of setting up a business from the whole money side of it i think of it more in terms of what i'd like to end up with to produce 

234.96 236.73 B: (( yeah right )) 

235.60 237.73 A: the service and um 

238.90 244.68 A: so i guess i'd have to measure success in actually making some money [laughter] i'm not sure 

244.84 248.59 A: i i don't know i'd have to just give it a try i'd probably have to start real small 

248.69 249.94 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

248.76 254.85 A: and um because my sewing is is slow i'd probably have to get help because um 

254.80 256.77 A: i'm just way too particular 

256.69 261.05 A: and i think [laughter] i told my husband once you know if i ever 

260.86 275.65 A: sewed to make money i'd make about a nickel an hour just 'cause i'm so darned slow so so it might not be the most practical thing for me but if i if it was a little bigger than just me and there were other people sewing and they could keep me from getting hung up on all the tiny details 

264.91 265.77 B: right 

275.49 276.64 B: right 

275.52 276.33 A: (( um )) 

277.04 285.36 A: then maybe it would work you know i'd if i was going to do something like that probably it would be an internet business something very small you know 

278.63 279.42 B: yeah 

284.78 292.78 B: yeah you know that's the way to go right now i mean there's um the internet side is because i mean people are just making boo goo bucks on the internet you know 

293.02 302.30 A: yeah and you know and and you can do a whole business or whatever and not even have to get dressed up you know you can just be sitting there in your sweats or whatever [laughter] 

298.75 300.16 B: oh yeah i mean 

301.37 306.74 B: yeah somebody says i would like this skirt made you know and okay well you know it's done in a week you know something like that 

306.29 310.38 A: yeah exactly and and you mail it and you don't have to have a shop and 

309.52 320.00 B: you know you really don't even have to mail it you know just kind of like u._p._s. or you know american they just kind of say okay you know we'll box it and everything for you you know 

314.22 315.20 A: yeah 

317.34 318.90 A: yeah they'll come to the house 

319.75 321.00 A: yeah that's true 

320.92 321.69 B: so 

321.14 334.51 A: and so then then what you could do is in that kind of business is you'd focus on your end product and focus on dealing with the customer and not focus so much on all the hiring firing you know all the stuff you need with a real store 

334.42 335.54 B: (( right yeah )) 

336.24 342.00 B: and i look at myself you know and i i think that i'd probably fail miserably 

341.41 342.52 A: [laughter] do you 

343.13 344.50 B: not because 

345.75 358.95 B: it's not because i don't think that i would make money or anything it's just because i care too much about people you know and some times you can't do that and with the type of business that i want to do th- the type of thing that i'd want to get into you know is always caring about people 

351.58 352.43 A: yeah 

358.87 359.77 A: right 

359.10 364.11 B: and i'd probably let them get away with a lot more than what i should to where i was losing money 

361.60 363.18 A: yeah i can see what you mean 

363.63 368.98 A: yeah the way you would be setting that up would be to help them basically and um 

367.70 368.59 B: right 

369.44 384.02 A: that's a that's a very nice thing to do but yeah but there's not usually much money in it [laughter] it's kind of the problem with the sewing business too i'd want to provide these at good prices for people and 'cause i have friends who home school and whatever and this is how they like to dress and 

373.00 375.13 B: (( yeah and that's exactly my point )) 

384.04 386.06 A: none of them have any money 

386.11 387.09 A: so 

388.03 393.65 A: as far as a business making money ah maybe you and i aren't cut out for it [laughter] i don't know [laughter] 

393.01 402.62 B: right i i'm i mean my wife tells me that all the time you're too nice and i'm like well you know but ah i guess if i give god will give back to me that's how i believe so 

402.46 403.49 A: yeah 

403.19 409.83 B: but yep i don't know i'd pr- but i'd probably fail miserably because of the fact that i would just 

407.61 408.53 A: (( well well )) 

409.65 413.10 A: you might not though because you've been actually thinking about this 

412.61 420.17 B: i have been thinking about it and i'd try you know i got it all planned out you know but it's all about funding and you know finding places to take care of 

419.11 428.68 A: it is but your wife would be a nice balance to you because i- if you're going too far on the not you know not let making people pay their payments or do whatever they're supposed to do 

428.53 435.03 A: she might be in the background saying now david you have to [laughter] send them a bill 

431.45 432.22 B: (( people )) 

432.47 433.90 B: yeah she would 

436.10 440.14 B: probably once i got it all set up tell me that i have to find someone else to run it so 

439.94 442.13 A: [laughter] yeah 

441.61 443.32 B: yeah that'd probably 

443.21 444.75 A: that would be her advice then 

444.59 446.92 B: oh yeah that'd be her advice on it 

447.24 451.42 A: i think it sounds like you and i neither of us are business people per se [cough] 

451.63 453.68 A: we have ideas for things we'd like to do 

454.28 458.20 A: but i don't think either of us has what you could call a real business plan or 

458.15 462.84 B: no i'd probably have to sit down and think about it even even an- even more but 

458.23 459.20 A: [laughter] anything 

462.21 464.05 A: yeah yeah 

464.52 466.09 B: no business plan though 

465.73 467.43 A: [laughter] 

466.20 469.88 B: nope just kind of it's kind of like fly by the hip type thing 

469.24 476.03 A: yeah yeah so well what else shall we say about that [laughter] 

473.85 474.64 B: well 

475.51 476.75 B: i don't know 

476.72 478.98 A: is this your first ah of the 

478.28 480.23 B: this is my first is it your first 

479.62 482.78 A: yes it is i ju- i'd never heard of it till today 

482.85 485.41 B: oh my wife signed me up 

484.98 486.14 A: [laughter] 

485.44 490.35 B: a couple of days ago so i was like well i guess i will do it you know 

486.88 487.48 A: (( oh )) 

490.25 497.99 A: yeah oh there's nothing to lose and it it's kind of fun to talk to people about something that someone assigns you to talk about 

494.82 495.89 B: oh yeah 

497.81 498.98 B: right 

499.20 500.32 B: well 

499.23 500.27 A: so 

500.45 503.47 A: h- how do we know when we're done i think they tell us or something 

502.80 504.68 B: um i believe so 

504.50 505.42 A: okay 

505.41 506.57 B: but i don't know 

506.42 507.61 A: [laughter] 

507.76 509.20 B: but 

509.28 510.64 A: so what kind of 

509.54 512.21 B: so we don't think that we'd be very good business people 

511.82 514.46 A: um probably not [laughter] 

513.39 515.64 B: yeah and your product 

514.49 521.97 A: i think our hearts are both in the right place but i don't think our um business savvy is maybe in place [laughter] 

521.54 531.90 B: yeah you probably like find some people to do that stuff for you though and just like supervise on those types of things you know and expect your product to be top notch 

531.74 532.68 A: yeah 

532.40 537.19 B: and that'd probably make your business probably more successful if you weren't directly involved yourself 

536.88 544.14 A: yes or not so yes i- if you weren't at least alone and you had someone else to say you got to be a little more practical here [laughter] 

543.51 547.98 B: right but i mean your business idea is a great idea because i mean there's people selling 

548.05 550.21 B: you know baked beans on the internet right now 

550.01 551.00 A: right 

550.55 553.03 B: you know so it's very feasible 

552.73 566.62 A: well and i know a lot a lot of christian women who are kind of tired of the clothes that are available and um it it's not easy to find clothing that most of us would consider modest um the lengths come and go in style so th- 

557.50 558.59 B: right 

562.82 563.66 B: (( right right oh yeah )) 

566.52 570.03 A: you know a long jumper for instance might be in style for a while but 

570.07 577.94 A: then the style will change so that it has slits way up the leg and [laughter] you know it's and then suddenly you can't buy what you need so 

578.44 584.39 A: i think that's why a little business like that can be useful because it it's kind of got its own little niche market 

584.42 590.44 B: either that or you're probably the right market for it you've got to promote it a little bit 

587.39 588.56 A: yeah 

590.54 598.78 A: yeah and you know probably if i were ever going to actually do it i'd probably promote it through home schooling friends and through some um 

598.81 599.95 A: christian magazine
