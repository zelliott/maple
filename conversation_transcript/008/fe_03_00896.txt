495.52 509.79 A: yet like when it was like the season finale or the one before the season finale when they like showed who was picked he was like you know i think we have to watch that just because like i feel like we're missing something if we don't watch it because everybody's watching it and then you won't know [mn] so we watched that but like 

504.84 506.43 B: [laughter] 

509.59 519.38 A: he's like so anti all the like reality shows and [mn] i guess guys in general don't get as wrapped up necessarily [laughter] in things like that
