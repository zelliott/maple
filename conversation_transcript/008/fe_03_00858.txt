96.71 97.57 A: (( ah )) 

98.05 111.49 A: everyone everyone thinks that it's totally the ah school's responsibility and the parents ah sort of bail out and ah consequently the the youngsters are the ones who ah suffer in the long run

179.14 185.93 A: i was in the air force and did some traveling there and i was very much impressed with the school systems in japan as far as the 

186.20 187.51 A: fact that the ah 

188.43 189.74 A: teachers ah and 

189.76 200.26 A: the students and the parents were all you know it's a cooperative effort and i think that's what we need and i i think we're we're coming up short

203.15 204.19 B: [noise] 

204.97 207.49 A: but ah our ah 

209.15 216.80 A: i've had experience in around schools ah and there's a lot of differences between different schools ah 

216.86 228.37 A: i've i saw it ah i happen to be protestant which is neither here nor there but i saw i've had experience with a number of catholic high schools parochial high schools where ah 

224.52 225.79 B: (( ahah [noise] )) 

227.09 227.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

228.65 233.87 A: they have high standards and the of course the parents are paying tuition 

230.87 231.49 B: (( ahah )) 

233.91 239.06 A: so the parents have a real vested interest [laughter] in ah so 

239.07 241.28 A: ah ah it's not ah 

241.81 243.92 A: the parents are 

243.94 246.57 A: allied with the school officials 

246.72 249.57 A: too often ah the ah 

250.90 253.35 A: youngsters have a way of playing 

253.42 258.45 A: and sort of disguising the truth a bit and they it actually gets to the point where 

258.46 259.49 A: the ah 

260.52 261.23 A: they 

261.86 268.30 A: the ah parents and the schools become adversaries instead of cooperating on the 

267.80 268.64 B: (( [noise] )) 

269.92 274.75 B: there is a a private school that i'd like to put my son in but it's about twenty miles 

275.08 276.58 B: away from here 

277.30 278.12 B: [noise] 

277.89 281.23 A: thing that would pose a lot of problems forty miles of travel 

281.35 283.81 A: ah each school day ah [laughter] 

283.84 285.34 A: that would really be a 

286.79 289.43 A: even if you come up with some kind of a 

289.54 290.59 A: (( of a )) 

290.67 294.01 A: car car pooling thing or something it would be a real ah 

294.21 295.67 A: it would be a real 

295.91 299.40 A: something you'd really have to be dealing with all the time 

295.95 296.92 B: i'd love 

298.46 305.26 B: i'd love to enroll my three year old because they have a really good music program and he loves anything to do with music [laughter] 

306.29 307.35 A: (( but ah )) 

307.44 309.01 A: (( we ah )) 

310.14 317.45 A: have ah as i say we have these four ah four youngsters in ah high school and the one one in college 

317.53 318.37 A: (( ah )) 

318.59 320.51 A: grandchildren ah 

320.78 324.43 A: we've ah we're very fortunate with our with our children 

324.49 325.34 A: (( ah )) 

325.53 327.00 A: although we traveled 

327.33 331.77 A: we were traveling while i was in the service the school systems that we were in 

331.81 338.77 A: everywhere we were were top flight and it really pays off in the long run for the ah for the kids 

338.98 339.83 A: (( ah )) 

339.90 346.10 A: it's really a shame some of the ah some of the school systems are putting out youngsters that just can't read and 

342.54 343.56 B: [noise] 

345.50 346.55 B: that's true 

346.40 348.34 A: and if they can't read ah 

350.06 355.20 A: they just can't function any more because even the simplest jobs any more you have to have um 

355.48 365.09 A: you have to have a a a good reading comprehension ability to to do any kind of ah mechanical work or anything else nowadays a long time ago 

365.11 368.33 A: ah that wasn't true but it certainly is now 

368.53 380.81 B: and it also takes the teachers to determine you know which child is falling behind and on down the line just every teacher lets that child slip back further and further then they get a diploma and they don't know anything [laughter] 

380.16 382.98 A: yeah oh yes it's ah ah 

383.36 384.44 A: and ah 

385.26 393.29 A: then if ah you know they do get a they do get a job well then ah they're ah they're on ah a fast track to fail obviously 

392.12 393.29 B: mhm 

393.95 394.95 A: but um 

395.59 399.44 A: have you have you been participating in this program for some time

405.57 418.54 A: my son ah hi- my son's company was actually involved with this company on something and my son you know said it was on the up and up and and that you know that ah he thought i might enjoy ah participating
