0.19 2.28 B: [mn] hello my name's david [mn] 

0.85 2.01 A: hello 

2.33 4.76 A: david hi my name is shannon 

4.36 5.73 B: hi shannon 

5.75 9.37 A: um i'm a first time caller i guess so 

8.97 9.90 B: [mn] me too 

10.49 18.02 A: oh okay good um well i guess we're talking about public schools i'm i'm driving 

18.03 21.76 A: home right now so um hopefully i won't get cut off 

21.46 23.24 B: okay i hope so [mn] 

23.19 25.16 A: yeah um 

25.76 27.32 A: do you have an opinion 

26.95 36.25 B: [mn] yeah uh public schools um i've studied a little bit about education and um [mn] i i think certainly they have flaws 

36.68 43.66 B: um [mn] the just with the general distribution of resources um [lipsmack] 

43.77 55.50 B: be- because most schools are funded by property tax [mn] if a region is poor they can fund the school less um [mn] and that results in great [mn] inequality um [lipsmack] 

56.08 58.28 A: between the different districts 

57.90 59.32 B: yeah [mn] 

59.55 60.42 A: okay 

60.26 62.84 B: um i think that's uh 

63.24 67.47 B: a a big problem ah that we have to deal with and 

68.24 73.83 B: [lipsmack] um in my in my class anyway if a ch- charter schools and 

75.46 81.14 B: the the private school programs that have been discussed [mn] and um 

81.53 89.85 B: by politicians and by my school being very liberal um were sort of against them because they thought it perpetuated 

90.34 93.29 B: the inequalities of various regions 

93.78 96.35 A: so by charter schools do you mean um 

96.67 98.29 A: schools that 

98.63 103.60 A: the parents get money from the government and are able to choose their own schools or 

102.59 103.46 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

103.68 105.11 B: [mn] well right 

104.27 105.83 A: (( is that a charter school )) 

106.48 113.93 B: [mn] yeah it's um it's um it's a school not run by the town or the state but an independent organization coming in um 

112.33 113.19 A: okay 

113.34 114.88 A: bigger private school then 

114.47 115.76 B: (( yeah )) 

115.44 116.32 A: okay 

116.21 117.75 B: um 

118.29 122.87 B: [mn] and i guess the plan that ah the government was talking about a while ago was to give 

122.91 127.15 B: a a a tax credit of some sort to um 

126.57 127.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

127.32 131.33 B: parents who who chose to send their children to charter schools 

131.39 139.27 B: um the problem with it was that um the tax credit wouldn't be equal for people of all 

139.59 143.80 B: classes obviously because people of different classes pay different amounts of tax 

144.43 152.21 B: and they wouldn't really help the poorer classes to get their children out of poor public schools and into the better 

151.98 153.13 A: (( oh okay )) 

152.79 154.81 B: presumably better charter schools 

155.49 158.31 A: so ah what stage are you in what 

158.68 162.78 A: was there something that was offered at the federal level or by state 

162.48 170.89 B: [mn] i think it was a a federal thing ah [mn] i must admit that was before i was very politically aware [laughter] [laughter] 

168.80 170.89 A: [laughter] okay 

171.42 184.67 A: because i i'm in california and i've i've only heard about um i we thought it was at the state leve- level but i'm not sure either 'cause it's been a couple of years where um 

182.90 183.87 B: yeah 

185.02 187.32 A: the government was 

187.49 189.49 A: thinking about the option of 

189.90 195.65 A: giving money to the parents to pay for private schools if that was their choice 

195.50 196.37 B: right 

195.67 209.23 A: but maybe this is a different issue so if you wanted your child not to go to um the public school but a private school the same amount of money that would go in to that particular child at the public school would be handed over to the parents 

209.45 212.53 A: and they could use that towards a private school 

212.36 212.99 B: (( oh )) 

212.58 213.82 A: of their wishes 

213.65 218.49 B: that sounds like what i remember so it must have been the state level i'm sorry [laughter] [mn] 

217.82 219.38 A: okay okay 

220.53 222.62 A: i'm not sure what i think about that 

223.37 230.39 B: i don't know [mn] i don't know if it's been demonstrated that the private school programs are are better than the um the 

230.47 232.08 B: public school programs 

232.64 239.87 B: [mn] um so i don't know if allowing people to go to private school is a better solution anyway 

241.64 245.34 A: right yeah i don't know either i think um 

245.85 248.35 A: i guess kind of related to the same 

248.36 251.57 A: type of issue um is that you see 

252.21 256.20 A: a big difference among different communities so 

256.31 261.96 A: i've worked in some wealthy areas in san diego where 

261.99 269.32 A: you know these all the parents are doctors and lawyers and the schools the public schools in their communities are 

269.40 270.65 A: very nice 

271.61 279.14 A: there's ah several computers in each classroom and they have a lot of support and then i've also worked in um 

279.84 281.49 A: more of an inner 

281.50 285.41 A: city type of school with with minorities in in 

285.07 285.63 B: (( [mn] )) 

285.61 290.45 A: city and they don't even have 

290.59 292.91 A: colored paper all the time or ah 

292.73 294.15 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

293.25 304.08 A: you know they need to buy new pens and markers where these like upper class um public schools they were to- tossing away their old ah 

304.79 315.04 A: old ah pens and buying new pens every semester and one thing i ended up doing was collecting it and taking it down to mexico to at least give to somebody 

314.86 316.65 B: ah that's a great idea [mn] [mn] 

315.38 319.75 A: but yeah i've i've definitely seen that they've even 

320.43 327.65 A: taken computers and just want to throw the computers in the trashcan and we've taken them and put them in um 

327.98 332.08 A: different schools that would actually set them up and use them 

332.48 333.54 A: but um 

333.56 334.34 A: (( i )) 

334.49 338.31 A: there's definitely an issue of where the the money goes 

338.95 340.50 B: yeah 

339.12 340.37 A: (( and implements )) 

340.99 347.85 B: [mn] and and one thing people have thought about i as i remember is they're trying to 

348.01 354.84 B: just take the tax for like the state say and then divide it equally among all school districts 

354.94 356.75 B: but 

356.86 366.16 B: that um [mn] that just doesn't go well with most people because they they move into a community because they had a good school system or something [mn] 

366.14 367.16 A: (( yeah [laughter] right )) 

367.06 368.32 B: (( um [mn] )) 

368.30 371.20 A: yeah i've i've heard about that option too 

371.42 375.41 A: but then i guess you could argue if you are one of the parents who are paying um 

375.56 377.08 A: high taxes 

377.31 379.53 A: you do expect a little bit more 

379.15 380.56 B: right 

381.42 385.64 A: even though it's not really fair to the child given the equal 

385.91 387.28 A: opportunity 

387.17 389.22 B: [mn] [lipsmack] right 

389.32 400.41 B: ah like like like you said some schools have all the technology and and very current programs and some schools don't have enough m- microscopes for their chemistry classes and stuff like that 

400.72 405.90 B: um [mn] i i just don't know i don't know how to resolve that though [laughter] 

404.53 410.43 A: [laughter] i don't know either so yeah i guess those are some of the fundamental um 

410.61 411.77 A: problems 

412.13 414.58 A: (( other than that i think there's ah )) 

415.12 417.86 A: (( maybe a social issue with some of the )) 

418.28 420.88 A: kids now where um 

421.38 422.69 A: teachers 

422.87 425.73 A: since i have worked in some public schools i've 

426.21 429.41 A: noticed that teachers are a lot less strict 

429.56 434.22 A: than when i was in school or at least that's my perception now where 

434.56 440.85 A: kids talk back or they use language in school that would wouldn't be tolerated at all 

441.10 442.66 B: yeah 

441.16 443.17 A: (( when i was in elementary school )) 

443.96 452.83 B: yeah i don't i don't i don't know how that [mn] came about but that that is certainly my perception too is that as time goes on teachers [mn] 

452.98 454.87 B: sort of care less and less 

454.91 456.19 B: um 

456.30 464.88 B: in when they're in bad situations i don't know if it's because they're frustrated because what they've tried early on hasn't met with success or if it's 

465.26 467.39 B: just that they're getting older 

465.48 466.30 A: (( or )) 

466.37 469.03 A: that's what everybody does even 

469.27 470.12 A: like 

470.57 474.31 A: if all the kids talk like they do then 

475.01 477.58 A: it's almost normal rather than 

479.00 480.33 A: (( [mn] yeah i d- i don't know )) 

481.84 485.00 A: a lot of economic and social problems that 

485.12 487.62 A: (( they're not there's no simple answer )) 

487.66 489.70 B: [lipsmack] no certainly not [mn] 

491.77 494.12 A: so other than that 

494.68 500.64 B: [mn] standardizing the curriculum on a federal level i j- i don't know if that would work [laughter] 

500.85 502.96 B: i hear that they do that in japan 

503.09 504.58 B: um 

504.03 505.98 A: where they have certain um 

506.85 507.62 A: like 

507.78 510.46 A: at each level like each grade i 

510.63 511.51 B: as i 

510.72 511.51 A: (( mean are )) 

511.72 513.10 B: oh go ahead 

513.12 514.14 A: (( no go ahead )) 

513.71 516.47 B: um as i understand it in japan they have 

516.50 530.23 B: um a couple of volumes um in their education department or whatever that says by the end of third grade children will be able to do these things and then they have something like that for each year 

530.44 531.91 B: um 

532.02 539.98 B: and i know that [mn] the united states at least is moving toward that with some of the standardized testing um movements 

540.15 543.38 B: i know i know in massachusetts there's um 

543.49 550.46 B: there's a test you have to pass as a sophomore in high school in order to get a diploma [lipsmack] um 

550.68 554.19 B: yeah that that's where i'm from massachusetts um 

553.64 554.75 A: (( oh oh okay )) 

554.30 565.05 B: [lipsmack] and it was it was really a problem when it first got [mn] implemented because people were like well how is this fair why does it happen at your sophomore year 

566.27 570.85 B: you know all those sorts of constraints uh complaints sorry [laughter] ah 

569.95 570.85 A: (( they )) 

572.17 574.59 A: so are are they doing that now 

574.37 576.20 B: (( yeah )) 

575.30 576.76 A: yeah they are okay 

576.85 578.42 A: (( so it has been in place )) 

578.45 592.65 B: yeah and i know teachers are really complaining about it takes like two weeks to do all the testing so they lose all that time it's it's it's a weird paradox of you have to prepare your students to do this but you have less time to do it now and 

588.58 589.52 A: [mn] 

592.61 593.73 A: (( right )) 

593.89 599.88 A: i've heard about the same thing um being proposed in california but i'm not sure that anything's gone through
