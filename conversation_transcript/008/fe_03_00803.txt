22.74 23.63 A: what do you want to do 

23.95 25.92 A: if you have a chance to do time travel 

26.78 27.60 B: um 

31.90 33.81 B: i probably wouldn't really change anything 

36.02 36.92 A: but typically 

37.29 38.42 A: people at least in 

38.68 39.86 A: f- (( fictionary )) 

39.97 40.86 A: situation where 

41.46 46.01 A: if you have a chance to go back and change historical events other than personal events 

48.42 49.49 B: well what would you change 

50.79 53.25 A: oh i i suppose uh certain 

54.66 56.09 A: let me think 

57.06 57.64 A: you know those 

57.81 60.27 A: big critical things i suppose certain 

60.62 61.68 A: um for example 

62.19 62.76 A: um 

63.01 64.96 A: certain things hanging on y- the hair 

65.67 67.64 A: about for two thousand 

67.82 69.46 A: presidential election 

70.05 71.29 A: you know if you go back 

71.45 71.78 A: huh 

71.91 73.34 A: it depends on who you are i mean 

73.62 75.72 A: can you make a change and (( )) 

76.22 79.02 A: to be the results are going to be 

80.10 80.94 B: yeah 

80.13 81.23 A: that would be i think 

82.55 85.05 A: for example you go back to florida two years ago 

85.98 86.81 A: then you know 

87.44 91.06 A: depending on how the vote was counted and how many people voted 

91.33 92.55 A: -cause it comes down to really 

93.09 95.36 A: to uh a few hundreds of votes 

95.66 96.12 B: mhm 

96.86 98.30 A: yeah so 

99.14 101.97 A: so um that that is i suppose uh would be 

102.32 103.31 A: very interesting 

103.50 104.76 A: i i'm sure uh actually i 

105.14 108.33 A: read the other day where al gore was saying you know 

108.86 113.18 A: people were asking him what he wants to do i'm sure if he has a chance to go back 

114.48 116.56 A: he he may do something different 

117.26 117.78 B: yeah 

118.63 119.50 B: i'm sure he would 

119.83 120.53 B: have yeah 

121.94 125.85 A: uh for example how he handled the campaign dah dah dah 

126.39 126.88 A: (( )) 

127.49 129.83 A: well im- improved his chances or what 

131.91 134.48 B: yeah probably campaign harder in north florida 

135.59 136.08 A: yeah 

136.29 137.64 A: yeah that is true 

138.02 139.00 A: yup 

140.04 140.81 A: but uh 

141.85 142.66 A: i don't know why 

144.31 146.85 A: my most familiarity with uh 

148.25 150.95 A: some time travel was uh the movie called um 

151.64 152.64 A: back to the future 

153.56 154.05 B: mhm 

153.88 155.94 A: bet you never have seen that movie have 

156.58 157.16 A: (( )) 

157.57 158.34 B: yeah 

159.55 160.40 A: yeah you've seen that 

160.47 160.79 B: yeah 

165.52 167.11 A: okay 

169.22 169.97 A: um 

172.58 173.06 A: let's see 

173.53 173.98 A: what else 

174.08 174.90 A: if you want to go back 

177.40 178.75 B: um 

181.47 182.49 B: space shuttle blown up 

183.86 184.49 A: yeah 

184.69 185.34 A: yeah 

186.13 186.96 A: that is true 

188.78 189.39 A: yeah 

192.88 195.05 A: yeah i think they haven't really forgot what 

196.89 200.39 A: what uh well they had to guess what caused it 

200.74 202.73 A: so one question i heard was 

203.57 205.84 A: if they knew they had a problem 

206.51 208.77 A: after they uh announced this 

208.88 209.61 A: space shuttle 

209.99 210.92 A: what can they do 

211.49 211.85 B: yeah 

211.87 212.20 A: (( but )) 

213.05 216.70 A: (( on )) the one hand i heard they said that there is really not much you can do 

217.52 222.39 A: that they couldn't (( )) the space station they um couldn't last very long 

223.02 223.70 A: in the space 

223.97 224.36 A: you know 

224.48 226.63 A: waiting for another shuttle to go rescue them 

226.88 227.42 B: mhm 

227.89 230.18 A: and they have no way of repairing it 

231.09 232.20 A: and this uh 

232.33 234.06 A: little chance of stuff like 

234.86 235.68 A: having a good 

237.22 238.80 A: good look at those damages 

239.20 239.90 A: anyway 

240.26 240.65 B: yeah 

242.55 248.04 A: so um yeah it is uh really tough yeah 

249.10 249.47 B: yeah 

250.69 251.11 B: you know 

251.52 251.95 B: something like 

252.10 252.89 B: nine eleven 

254.50 255.13 A: yeah 

255.68 258.57 A: yeah i i'm sure that many people can 

259.54 260.60 A: supposed to do to 

260.78 261.41 A: (( )) 

262.32 262.67 B: yeah 

263.46 263.86 A: yeah 

264.88 265.95 B: that is probably the 

266.20 267.89 B: biggest thing recently you know 

269.16 272.24 A: true true yeah 

272.60 274.08 A: yeah even this (( talk )) of 

274.21 274.86 A: (( saying )) we'll be 

275.21 275.61 A: (( )) 

275.42 275.86 B: yeah 

277.40 278.30 A: yeah 

279.59 282.05 A: where were you uh when that happened 

283.20 283.64 B: i was 

283.94 284.47 B: uh 

285.15 285.63 B: eating 

286.54 287.53 B: in the cafeteria 

286.97 287.56 A: (( )) 

288.46 288.94 A: yeah 

289.76 291.61 A: i'm in the west coast so i just 

291.84 292.76 A: woke up and 

293.55 297.39 A: you know usually i turn my clock radio to to wake me up and 

297.74 298.65 A: you know the news news 

299.33 299.75 B: yeah 

300.50 301.04 A: wow 

302.51 303.40 A: (( it was uh )) 

304.88 305.79 A: quite shocking 

307.49 309.05 B: but like this weekend i was 

310.18 311.25 B: out at a drill meet 

312.29 313.29 B: with r._o._t._c. 

314.39 315.26 B: when that happened 

314.47 315.06 A: uh-huh 

316.28 316.89 A: oh 

318.52 319.72 A: yeah 

320.77 323.43 A: i was pretty late like i didn't know until the eve- 

324.89 325.34 A: -ning 

338.57 343.91 A: okay well as with time travel i don't know if you have an interest to go to a different year or to 

344.07 344.85 A: (( )) 

346.84 350.15 A: other than to change anything 

350.04 351.89 B: i would just like go to the future 

354.12 354.84 B: that would be the best 

355.42 363.83 A: we can go to the future to see what works and come back and and introduce something earlier 

363.38 363.73 B: yup 

364.41 366.49 A: that seems to be a good idea 

368.79 371.11 A: so uh we'll find out hm if the 

371.89 373.32 A: like uh you know 

374.60 375.65 A: t._v. or 

376.36 379.63 A: computers or what kind of ways we are using them 

379.87 380.87 A: that will be 

381.41 383.00 A: (( )) information 

384.86 385.36 A: indeed 

385.85 387.25 B: yeah that would probably be the best thing 

391.17 392.22 B: who it is done and all 

393.82 394.72 A: how i'm sorry 

395.17 396.22 B: see how it is done 

396.92 397.48 A: yeah 

397.72 398.20 A: yeah 

399.90 400.30 A: yeah 

401.93 402.56 A: that is true 

405.32 406.18 A: yeah well we 

406.84 409.73 A: people are having (( )) at home where 

410.41 413.72 A: at least the p._c. will be more important or the t._v. you know 

414.34 414.69 B: yeah 

414.40 418.93 A: some people have different views and it would be nice to to know now that 

419.15 420.45 A: (( )) 

422.33 423.57 A: maybe neither 

423.88 424.20 A: you know 

424.80 425.76 B: yeah that is true 

425.01 426.51 A: i mean so they (( )) into 

426.71 427.35 A: each other 

427.75 428.67 A: so 

428.72 430.12 B: yeah i'm really sorry about that 

433.32 433.83 A: yeah 

434.69 435.33 A: that is true 

436.78 437.61 A: yup 

441.59 444.01 A: well transportation is another thing we 

444.11 446.61 A: interesting to see in ten years how 

446.76 449.45 A: well ten years is probably too short fifty years 

449.92 453.80 A: if people change the way of getting around 

455.61 458.18 B: yeah i think in about ten years you will see a big difference 

458.92 460.20 A: ten years well 

460.15 463.12 B: yeah probably with all the you know hybrid stuff coming out 

464.05 464.54 A: mh- 

465.31 466.49 A: yeah actually uh 

466.96 468.17 A: care if i was uh 

468.69 472.35 A: if i was a (( )) have you seen this uh where they uh 

472.79 473.53 A: what do you call it 

473.83 474.36 B: no 

475.07 478.41 A: it's it's uh it is like a scooter but you can put 

478.59 480.33 A: both of your feet on the scooter 

480.62 481.93 A: and it goes sideways 

482.10 483.53 A: you have uh two big wheels 

483.82 484.13 B: yeah 

484.82 486.73 A: and it moves about 

487.42 487.96 A: (( )) 

488.49 490.57 A: five to ten miles per hour 

491.72 496.34 A: and at the time of introduction they think that is going to change 

496.92 498.56 A: they way people travel 

498.67 499.02 A: right 

499.16 499.96 A: you know locally 

500.38 500.73 B: yeah 

501.33 502.21 A: but uh 

502.60 505.95 A: at this point many cities actually banned them 

506.42 507.28 A: to use 

507.56 508.57 A: on the sidewalk 

511.57 513.51 A: uh (( )) 

513.93 516.99 A: so anyway they uh the companies have um 

517.58 519.28 A: they were sending it to um 

519.65 520.63 A: post officer 

520.91 521.28 A: for 

521.40 522.19 A: mail delivery 

522.65 523.05 B: yeah
