44.12 47.80 B: yeah why not i i don't know if i had a chance to go back 

48.37 48.68 A: mhm 

48.71 55.22 B: i would probably change my major at the university because i was majoring in linguistics 

55.47 61.52 B: and yeah after two years i understood that it is not my cup of tea and i switched to philosophy 

55.50 56.34 A: uh-huh oh 

61.84 62.64 A: oh really 

61.93 64.82 B: and psychology 

65.29 68.20 B: so i had to get uh like double masters and 

68.37 71.65 B: it is it is really bad you know it took so much time 

69.99 72.97 A: ended up using a lot of your time right 

72.69 76.09 B: yeah yeah i lost a year actually so 

75.59 77.17 A: oh my gosh i had 

83.44 84.06 B: uh yes 

84.27 87.10 A: in the middle of my schooling yeah and i ended up losing a year 

87.84 88.53 B: oh my god 

87.87 88.49 A: simply because 

88.76 90.86 A: you know in different states um 

91.56 92.03 B: mhm 

91.72 94.00 A: you know they have different requirements for your major so 

93.42 94.83 B: yeah that is right 

95.53 97.00 A: so that was a real pain 

97.09 105.55 B: yeah yeah that is a pain that is a great pain i don't know i actually yeah wouldn't change anything in my life i think that 

100.28 101.60 A: yeah 

106.02 107.54 B: like uh 

107.78 117.38 B: i would not just because i don't know what is going to happen and you know if i go back and change something how would i know that uh it wouldn't effect me badly then 

110.79 111.60 A: exactly 

124.27 124.82 B: yeah oh 

128.54 129.01 B: mhm 

128.65 131.38 A: i i i'm kind of like you i don't think i ever could of 

131.84 138.81 A: i i wouldn't feel comfortable saying i would want to change whatever thing because like you said you never know what could 

138.92 139.32 A: effect 

139.08 140.54 B: yeah that is right 

139.76 142.11 A: happen in the long term so 

141.11 150.37 B: i remember this movie like back to the future where they kept traveling back in time changing things and then it is like a disaster future 

143.92 144.26 A: yeah 

150.00 151.28 A: exactly 

162.07 162.56 A: mhm 

165.91 166.26 A: uh-huh 

185.69 186.90 A: oh my gosh 

188.16 192.07 A: that is crazy but yeah i mean i always try to um 

192.63 195.31 A: like optimistic when it comes to stuff like that 

194.55 195.43 B: yeah 

195.46 200.71 A: and say you know when people go oh gosh if this that or the other hadn't happened for example um 

200.64 201.12 B: mhm 

207.91 208.40 B: yeah 

210.67 211.15 B: mhm 

213.57 214.26 B: yeah 

215.99 220.56 A: i- y- we would be better off or worse off there is really no way to know so 

218.43 219.44 B: mhm mhm 

219.95 229.20 B: because yeah there are so many coincidences how can you just you know sometimes you can not trace the uh association that le- leads you to some kind of a (( deed )) or 

229.33 239.14 B: things you do things you think and so on so if you change something then it is going to be like well i don't know you know what is going to happen how can i just change it 

231.27 231.91 A: mhm 

239.47 241.06 B: stupid 

240.37 241.52 A: i (( know )) 

241.23 243.32 B: (( know )) 

242.56 245.32 A: i i was trying to think of uh what 

245.73 247.34 A: simply change and i'm thinking 

248.13 258.66 A: you know the first thing i was thinking was i wouldn't have moved during college but i had to because if i if i hadn't i wouldn't have met my husband you know so that would have been a bad thing 

252.58 253.33 B: oh okay 

257.34 257.84 B: mhm 

258.86 259.98 B: ah yeah 

259.80 264.46 A: and so it's just you know i- it's really kind of a hard kind of question to answer 

271.06 271.31 A: (( think )) 

273.56 277.37 B: anything around like the environment and stuff so 

276.50 277.56 A: right exactly 

277.97 279.35 A: it's probably better just to 

288.09 288.36 A: (( )) 

293.76 296.17 A: yeah 

296.31 298.17 A: you speak really great after (( ))

307.52 309.55 A: y- you speak really really well 

309.52 316.03 B: oh thank you it was the faculty of foreign language that that is why my small secret 

320.27 320.82 B: mhm 

323.18 323.75 B: um 

324.72 328.63 A: you know when i was in high school but oh my gosh if you ask me now to speak french i would be 

329.08 329.94 B: yeah 

329.20 331.16 A: in bad trouble 

330.88 333.78 B: yeah i speak german as well 

333.44 334.24 A: do you really 

334.08 338.21 B: yeah it was the second language at the university probably 

338.54 339.86 B: i don't know 

340.07 349.75 B: if i go back i probably like the third language was uh i chosen to um you know like learn was japanese and yeah and like i 

347.13 348.06 A: i- oh wow 

356.38 356.87 A: mhm 

372.14 375.23 A: right something that is kind of based in all the other stuff that you're studying 

374.45 379.82 B: yeah spanish and uh whatever and not japanese that was so exotic (( )) you know 

383.64 388.11 A: are connected you never know in the future maybe you'll be in a situation you could be like oh my gosh i'm 

388.22 389.37 A: so glad i took that 

389.23 391.04 B: yeah probably you know 

390.05 392.60 A: japanese course or something you know 

391.67 400.37 B: yeah you never know you never know what happens so if we saw you know our future it would be so cool you know 

398.85 399.59 A: i know 

400.11 402.35 A: there is sometimes 

400.51 401.27 B: yeah 

401.42 402.28 B: but it is like 

402.63 408.31 A: i i was going to say there are sometimes where i wish you could kind of see what is going to happen in the future but it is probably better that we don't 

408.70 409.33 B: yeah 

409.75 410.21 A: (( you know )) 

419.64 420.24 A: huh 

420.88 421.24 A: uh-huh 

429.66 429.97 A: mhm 

437.59 437.96 A: (( )) 

443.16 445.53 A: right 

451.75 452.26 A: yeah 

452.38 454.75 B: so as you say you know optimistic 

452.67 453.02 A: that is a 

455.12 456.46 A: that that's a positive uh 

456.57 460.93 A: outlook i've always heard um hope for the best and expect the worst 

456.81 457.40 B: yeah oh 

461.17 462.63 A: and you'll be okay 

464.47 465.71 A: yeah exactly 

470.11 470.42 A: yup 

470.79 472.43 B: yeah accidentally 

471.00 471.32 A: yup 

472.74 482.24 B: well it's so difficult you know it's so twisted like human life i don't know and it's just you know then you just start thinking about it 

482.43 483.97 A: yup it can get pretty scary 

482.91 489.09 B: it appears yeah oh my god how do we live you know it's impossible it's so complicated 

488.89 493.14 A: and i guess being a philosophy major you probably go through a lot of that 

493.10 496.59 B: yeah that is right and you know like 

496.72 501.69 B: there is such um like branch of philosophy which is called existentialism 

501.55 502.07 A: sure 

511.55 511.89 A: mhm 

512.01 512.70 A: mhm

520.52 521.17 A: (( )) 

521.83 524.02 A: it can be pretty depressing yeah 

534.59 535.13 A: yeah 

537.86 542.04 A: exactly that is how i feel whenever i like go to the ocean or something because 

538.59 539.29 B: yeah 

541.60 542.11 B: uh-huh 

542.33 554.22 A: you know you just don't see the end and it is kind of like wow you think you have you have such a handle on everything that is going on around and and we don't even know like attempt of of what else is going on out there 

545.57 546.26 B: yeah 

551.90 553.29 B: yeah that is right 

554.35 554.97 B: yeah 

555.10 559.88 B: and probably there is something happening to our world and stuff 

558.89 564.50 A: oh i totally think that there are i don't i don't i can't imagine like statistically with 

560.84 561.45 B: yeah
