25.90 31.35 B: sounds interesting so on public schools i gather you have a child in public school or not yet 

32.61 36.96 A: yes i do 

35.14 35.91 B: so you probably 

38.95 43.14 B: you you probably know a lot more than i do about what is wrong with public schools 

44.29 45.99 B: i don't have any kids so 

47.92 49.50 A: i have one 

50.97 51.98 A: they haven't 

52.21 59.01 A: see i live like right in the middle of two different school districts and i'd like for my son to go to one school district but i don't actually live in that one 

59.37 60.82 A: but i live closer to that one 

61.31 66.97 A: i think they way they for one the way they make their school district lines is totally stupid but 

66.78 68.37 B: the boundaries that they chop up 

68.54 69.65 A: yes i mean it is 

69.77 70.07 A: makes 

70.35 72.17 A: no sense whatsoever but 

73.82 74.13 A: um 

73.90 77.56 B: oh they are just trying to balance attendance and that changes every year anyway 

77.70 80.25 A: oh i know right now they are closing all of ours 

81.24 82.04 A: due to sickness 

82.70 84.70 A: they can close them left and right 

84.99 87.25 B: well they never did that when i was a student 

87.77 88.77 A: um me neither 

89.00 89.86 A: they've been getting the 

90.00 90.65 A: flu 

95.21 95.83 A: friday 

95.95 96.68 A: because they closed 

96.81 97.33 A: school 

97.58 97.87 A: or 

101.74 103.50 B: well that is interesting i wonder if that is 

104.36 106.90 B: kind of become a a way to get fridays off without 

107.67 110.52 B: suffering the uh low low attendance payments -cause 

111.25 112.90 B: i i seem to recall that they get 

113.03 114.58 B: paid by how much they 

115.15 116.54 B: how many students attend 

116.68 117.99 A: yeah i mean it's uh 

117.42 119.24 B: you think that would cost them to do that 

120.22 122.39 A: well they and then they have the make-up days and 

123.55 124.76 B: will they extend the year 

124.91 125.61 B: at the end 

125.80 126.39 A: yeah 

127.18 127.64 B: huh 

128.60 133.34 A: but i don't know how far they can extend it because uh they missed quite a bit this year 

133.95 135.72 A: course we didn't have great weather but 

137.59 139.24 B: i remember once it was 

139.77 143.68 B: school was closed because it was too hot but that was just because our school didn't have air conditioning 

144.16 145.69 A: they've never 

145.80 148.81 A: closed ours because it is too hot but it don't get too hot here 

154.89 157.06 B: many years ago i don't think they have done that since 

158.56 160.52 B: they tore down that school in fact and built 

160.67 161.92 B: built one with air conditioning 

167.84 168.87 A: i don't know why 

169.39 171.59 A: i don't know how it is in california but 

172.12 173.22 A: in indiana 

173.32 173.82 A: different 

175.07 175.59 A: they don't 

175.69 177.22 A: have the same curriculum 

177.77 178.66 A: the one school 

178.84 180.09 A: that i live closest to 

180.52 182.12 A: has a better curriculum 

182.25 184.79 A: than the school that i actually live in the district for 

185.62 186.00 B: huh 

185.66 186.01 A: and 

186.54 188.23 A: i would think since their 

188.41 191.99 A: public schools are sponsored by the state they would all have the same 

193.01 193.96 A: but they don't 

194.57 196.87 B: so each school gets to set their own curriculum 

197.21 200.36 A: yeah i mean they have like they have to also (( )) and 

200.47 201.69 A: you know they have to offer 

202.04 202.78 A: certain subjects 

202.89 203.64 A: but i'm talking like 

204.06 207.93 A: different foreign languages or what they actually teach because one school 

208.43 209.47 A: u- see you go to this 

210.35 212.20 A: the school i want my son to go to 

215.55 217.38 A: it is like they teach the first and sec- 

217.90 219.19 A: stuff that at the other school 

219.36 221.48 A: they don't teach them until they are in fourth or fifth grade 

222.75 223.15 B: huh 

223.48 223.95 A: i mean 

224.24 224.79 A: of course 

224.26 227.61 B: i wonder if it is just the availability of teachers or if it is just 

228.49 230.51 B: they just decide to go at things earlier 

238.21 239.24 A: just (( )) 

239.80 245.39 B: oh okay so you are just starting through the process you are going to learn a lot more about public school before it is all over 

242.41 242.71 A: yes 

245.62 247.07 A: oh i'm sure i will 

248.47 249.60 B: so me i uh 

250.29 254.23 B: everyone says how bad the public schools especially in california have become 

255.06 260.12 B: and i look at this and i say i got the great you know i got the education i demanded 

260.87 263.01 B: from the california public schools 

264.25 265.73 B: and it was a case of 

266.96 272.18 B: no i it wasn't that they had to teach me it was they had you know i demanded what i wanted to learn 

272.76 273.60 B: i was a very 

274.07 275.22 B: forceful student 

275.95 278.09 B: and so i was always going ahead of my 

278.53 279.29 B: coursework 

279.58 281.00 A: oh i did that too 

281.30 281.94 B: and 

283.88 287.53 B: if they weren't teaching what i wanted to learn i would just move right along 

288.10 289.77 B: and learn what i wanted to learn 

290.46 291.03 B: you know and 

292.04 295.79 B: sometimes i i forgot what they wanted to learn but sometimes i studied it too but 

296.57 297.01 B: you know i 

297.21 298.77 B: by the by the time i hit 

299.39 300.89 B: seventh grade i was uh 

301.49 305.67 B: a half a year ahead in math and by the time i hit high school i was a full year ahead 

307.19 307.77 B: and 

308.68 312.49 B: you know it was it was it was not it wasn't their doing it was i demanded it 

312.70 315.75 B: i said i you know i'm not interested in what you are teaching it is boring 

316.38 319.75 B: i want to learn this i want to learn algebra i want to learn geometry 

320.81 321.70 B: and so i ended up 

321.93 325.39 B: graduating a year early -cause i ran out of coursework at my high school 

329.91 330.21 B: but 

330.44 335.63 B: i i can see how a student who is not as forceful as i could definitely have fallen behind but 

336.71 339.83 B: i know it is a case of you you get what you want in some cases 

340.13 342.33 A: yeah and now that w- a lot of them 

342.55 344.00 A: they group them to what 

344.87 348.69 A: they put the smart kids in this class and they put the other kids in this class and then 

348.92 350.98 A: they put the lower kids in this class but the 

351.26 353.14 A: the kids that aren't learning as fast 

353.41 354.02 A: they give -em 

354.80 355.14 A: like 

356.01 356.41 B: yeah 

356.27 356.93 A: more of 

357.53 358.67 A: life lessons r- 

359.01 360.23 A: rather than schoolwork 

361.17 362.70 A: especially once they get in high school 

363.29 365.72 B: yeah and then they pass them just because they want to 

365.83 369.44 A: yeah -cause they teach them parenting skills and 

366.60 366.88 B: yeah 

369.58 370.57 A: ho- how to 

371.05 375.21 A: manage your household and stuff like this instead of teaching them what they should be teaching them 

375.36 376.44 B: which is pre- college 

376.59 376.93 A: yes 

379.74 382.23 A: -cause i know a lot more 

382.39 384.43 A: kids would probably go to college 

385.59 387.53 A: they were actually put in to that because 

387.64 389.07 A: indiana has a program 

389.18 389.51 A: called 

389.66 391.46 A: the twenty first century scholars 

392.05 392.45 A: where 

392.56 392.82 A: if 

393.25 395.87 A: if you are low income if your parents don't make enough money 

396.17 399.59 A: the state of indiana will pay for you to go to an indiana school for four years 

400.48 400.82 B: huh 

401.05 404.08 B: well that is that is true in every state they have got some programs 

402.87 403.16 A: yeah 

404.67 405.26 A: so i mean 

405.64 410.59 A: it wouldn't be a money situation if they would actually have the education at high school level 

411.17 412.58 A: it is just saying well 

413.13 413.85 A: these kids 

414.46 418.66 A: here don't look like they are interested in this and that and then just throwing them in these classes and 

420.55 422.74 B: well that is that kind of leads to another thing i 

423.18 425.46 B: again i don't have any kids in school but i've always 

425.71 426.36 B: wondered that 

427.61 428.36 B: you know it is 

429.87 432.50 B: the weakness that we that we give these people is 

432.64 433.95 B: that we give these kids is not 

435.00 436.23 B: we don't teach them 

436.70 438.98 B: it is that they don't know what they want to learn 

439.67 442.45 B: and that may be me who i know what i wanted to learn but 

443.88 444.71 B: you know it is like 

445.28 445.96 B: the w- w- 

446.70 449.94 B: the class that they missed out on is what do you want to be when you grow up 

450.29 450.94 A: yeah 

451.14 452.36 B: you know if if you 

452.47 454.31 B: ask them what they want to do later 

455.11 458.95 B: then they can like have direction if they don't know where they are going they don't know how to get 

459.22 461.01 B: there because they don't know where they want to go 

465.24 465.63 B: no 

469.72 475.02 A: i don't know my son knows what he wants to be but like he is actually going to be that (( )) 

472.91 473.32 B: well 

473.52 475.60 B: uh i think in kindergarten you don't have to but 

475.86 476.34 A: yeah 

476.18 479.02 B: i think by the time you hit high school you should have some career goals 

479.25 479.73 A: yeah 

479.32 480.20 B: and they don't teach 

480.54 483.34 B: it is -cause that is not a class you teach that is a class you ask 

483.49 483.92 A: yeah 

485.49 485.81 B: so 

487.75 490.16 B: so any idea how long we are supposed to go on 

489.97 490.73 A: no 

491.16 494.73 B: i don't know what this is they're i know that they are recording us and that is all i know i 

494.98 496.81 B: i guess they are going to do speech analysis 

499.51 500.92 A: i've never done this before i just 

501.34 501.98 A: a friend of mine was like 

502.16 502.89 A: you need to do this 

504.31 506.67 B: and that sound- sounded fun so i signed up for it 

506.06 506.33 A: (( )) 

510.35 511.76 A: i don't know how long we are supposed to 

511.96 513.69 A: talk or anything but 

514.23 517.28 B: well i think your accent is more interesting to them than mine 

520.66 522.11 A: (( )) 

522.78 524.07 B: oh no it's it's 

524.32 525.40 B: just the solid 

525.55 529.07 B: i just to have that accent i lived in chicago area for awhile 

530.62 531.09 B: so i
