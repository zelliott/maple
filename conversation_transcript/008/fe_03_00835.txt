309.80 311.18 B: [laughter] oh okay 

312.12 316.52 B: oh it's my first phone call and i actually get someone from the actual consortium 

316.49 319.45 A: (( oh yeah and this is my first also [mn] this )) 

317.12 318.88 B: (( all right )) 

319.19 320.49 B: what's that 

320.03 321.72 A: is my first phone call 

320.96 322.78 B: oh right well there you go 

322.49 326.35 A: yeah i've had a couple before but they were about terrorism 

326.08 326.95 B: (( ah )) 

326.46 333.36 A: and i don't really have too much to say about that so i keep skipping and this is the first one and i think i shouldn't skip any more 

329.42 331.13 B: [laughter] 

333.23 346.03 B: yeah well this is the first time i've been home when they've called i've gotten home the last few days and had four or five messages from the from the consortium saying [mn] but it's a pretty interesting 

346.88 348.09 B: project 

347.84 352.97 A: yeah yeah eventually i'll i'll be the one who's analyzing these like [laughter] transcribing them 

352.61 353.84 B: oh okay 

354.17 356.22 A: i'll transcribe my own speech 

355.63 359.99 B: (( [laughter] well that'll be easier )) 

359.36 362.97 A: [laughter] yeah well if the both of you were supposed to be talking about topics 

362.77 364.19 B: yeah 

363.43 364.36 A: yeah 

364.21 366.33 B: [laughter] 

365.40 367.59 A: the thing is this is really hard i 

367.85 374.24 A: i just don't know what i you know want to go back and change like there is really nothing that i want to change 

374.28 378.81 B: [mn] [mn] well in my my impression when i was reading the web page about the project 

378.62 379.38 A: mhm 

378.82 384.55 B: it doesn't really matter exactly what you talk about so long as it's natural conversation right 

383.47 388.70 A: well the thing is they want you to talk on topic i mean if you go off topic and chat it's 

389.03 390.08 A: sort of 

390.94 392.16 A: it it's not good 

391.81 393.41 B: no oh [mn] 

392.94 393.89 A: (( no [mn] because )) 

393.55 394.87 B: that's too bad [mn] 

394.05 399.26 A: otherwise people just chat about anything and you know it wouldn't be any point to just assign topics 

397.56 398.25 B: oh 

398.77 399.88 B: (( oh okay )) 

399.66 400.52 A: yeah 

400.12 404.13 B: i assumed the topics were just kind of to jumpstart a conversation but 

404.76 412.55 A: well yeah that too but i i'm not sure but i think that supposedly you you know had to talk about the topics 

412.15 417.64 B: mm all right well then think about going back in time and changing something [lipsmack] 

418.40 419.01 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

419.35 421.72 B: um 

424.41 424.97 B: (( [mn] )) 

425.19 428.99 B: (( yeah i just haven't had any big regrets i guess )) 

429.08 431.00 A: yeah i guess me too 

429.26 429.82 B: (( [mn] )) 

431.32 432.14 A: [laughter] 

432.22 446.05 B: um i think i probably something i would've done that i didn't is when i lived in germany i didn't travel as much as i could have there are a lot of places i didn't go that i would like to have um 

440.94 441.81 A: uh-huh 

444.51 445.59 A: right 

447.68 451.86 B: but can't think of anything i did do that i'd rather not have done 

454.02 454.58 B: (( [sigh] )) 

455.14 461.05 B: (( hm no [mn] )) 

460.57 463.88 A: yeah i guess maybe [laughter] maybe a similar 

464.30 470.23 A: thing that i did 'cause when i was in china i didn't really travel that much i pretty much just stayed in beijing 

467.58 468.46 B: (( were )) 

470.46 472.14 B: were you from beijing i 

471.63 472.58 A: yeah 

472.42 474.90 B: have a good friend that lives there 

474.31 475.32 A: oh really 

475.09 479.14 B: yeah sh- she's ah she's american her dad works for a british law firm 

478.89 480.20 A: oh okay [mn] 

479.47 481.94 B: in beijing she's she's lived 

480.60 481.59 A: yeah 

481.98 490.14 B: in between beijing and shanghai and hong kong she's lived there for like nine years or ten years or something like that 

489.73 491.90 A: i pretty much just stayed in beijing because 

492.08 497.71 A: you know it was hot in the summer and didn't really want to go around and do anything or [mn] just sit in 

498.41 499.86 A: and read 

500.14 502.12 A: you know magazines or something 

501.36 502.97 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

502.34 506.96 A: [mn] i guess i maybe i should have traveled more while i was there when i was 

503.85 504.41 B: (( [mn] )) 

507.45 510.79 A: you know um i worked there last summer 

510.89 517.40 A: and the summer of nineteen ninety eight and i really didn't do much when i was back 

512.94 513.75 B: mm 

517.35 517.99 B: mm 

518.31 520.96 B: yeah that that would probably be something i'd change that is 

521.00 522.15 A: yeah 

521.31 524.51 B: i wouldn't sit around as much i'd get out and do things more 

524.47 531.92 A: yeah but then you know when you're really actually you know go back in time you might be like too lazy to do it anyway 

525.05 526.17 B: (( you know )) 

530.65 535.16 B: yeah like ah i'm tired [laughter] i'll just sit around and and read [mn] 

532.37 534.20 A: [laughter] 

534.95 540.50 A: yeah sit around somewhere you know not so hot 'cause if you're really humid and hot 

540.26 541.43 B: yeah 

540.81 545.15 A: you go outside and you had a green a parasol because the sun was so bad 

544.87 545.67 B: (( mm )) 

545.53 546.36 A: (( [mn] )) 

546.90 548.33 B: yeah 

548.60 550.86 B: i can imagine [laughter] 

550.06 551.13 A: yeah 

551.18 552.81 A: um maybe 

553.49 556.13 A: i if i could go back in time 

556.83 561.62 A: who knows i might choose another university or something 'cause i went to u. penn to 

559.45 560.26 B: oh 

561.32 562.63 B: oh yeah 

562.09 563.22 A: (( undergrad )) 

563.31 570.03 A: so i don't know i mean it probably is my best choice but i wonder you know what would happen if i go to 

570.10 572.01 A: like n._y._u. or something 

571.55 573.13 B: yeah 

572.23 578.44 A: or um wha- [mn] where else could i get accepted to um you know u._c._l._a. or whatever 

578.07 581.85 B: yeah did you do your undergrad in linguistics then 

581.96 585.59 A: no my major was economics and international relations 

585.25 588.03 B: oh really [laughter] that's my major
