66.96 79.62 B: [mn] um just i like listening to the people sing and [mn] i watched a little bit of joe millionaire 'cause i was kind of intrigued by it and i think a lot of people were intrigued by that one would be why they watched that one just as to 

79.63 86.62 B: who was going to fall for whom and and then would they stay after they found out that um [lipsmack] he wasn't really a millionaire 

87.04 88.09 B: um

126.97 129.14 B: i don't remember what his name is 

128.47 136.26 A: yeah it was it was the they had i think they had two shows left and and my son and daughter in law said that they were gonna [mn] um 

136.45 141.28 A: [mn] just have one show and so they were disappointed 'cause they had to wait another week [mn] 

140.45 142.37 B: i remember that 

141.67 148.39 A: but that was kind of my introduction to it so i told 'em to make sure that they let me know what happened afterwards 

147.74 162.00 B: yeah [mn] well there i think at the end of it there were two there were two ladies left and [mn] one lady seemed um like she really cared about the money whereas the other one didn't she seemed um [mn] very down to earth and 

158.48 159.60 A: right 

161.09 167.32 A: i think her name was sarah she was the blonde headed lady and then the dark headed lady that he ended up cho- choosing 

163.20 164.23 B: the other one 

166.54 167.52 B: yes 

168.00 170.87 A: um it was zora 

170.29 180.83 B: yes that's right [mn] yeah so i just watched it there at the end and i and and again i didn't watch the whole thing but [mn] it seemed to me that that ah the other lady if her name was sarah it 

181.21 184.94 B: seemed like she [mn] probably would have cared a little bit more about the money 

184.49 192.96 A: [mn] yeah but i don't know even if i had c._b._s. c._b._c. and n._b._c. and and i don't know if i would watch them all the time

481.91 487.72 B: um when he was supposed to pick one and then they didn't and then they moved it another week it seemed they 

485.75 486.90 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

487.67 497.48 B: they clearly said that there was only gonna be one more and then they got everybody trapped into watching it again you know and the whole ratings thing i d- like it's old with me [laughter]
