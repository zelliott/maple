36.90 37.64 A: well 

37.83 39.49 A: we have uh public schools 

39.59 40.65 A: system topic 

40.94 41.50 B: yeah 

41.70 42.24 B: i 

42.52 43.61 A: and how what 

43.98 45.26 A: what can be done 

45.42 50.48 B: well they want to know your opinion do you think something is wrong and i do i don't think that 

51.08 51.72 B: um 

52.27 53.45 B: that they are 

54.03 57.98 B: directing their attention to where it needs to be done so we are i think we are heading for a problem 

58.34 60.75 B: worse problem in the future in my personal opinion 

60.91 61.62 A: um 

62.12 62.91 A: i would like to 

63.05 63.74 A: say 

63.97 67.03 A: something maybe mandatory uh about school uniform 

68.24 70.13 A: do you have children that are in school 

70.32 71.88 B: i do not i have 

71.59 72.81 A: i don't either mine are 

75.66 77.27 A: but i kind of like 

77.56 79.91 A: the idea of school of school uniform 

80.36 81.72 B: i have to agree with you 

82.79 84.51 B: i think it would settle a lot with 

82.82 83.24 A: um 

84.89 87.16 B: problems within the schools themselves but i think 

87.36 87.85 B: the 

88.56 89.13 B: um 

89.24 90.81 B: the topic i i'm not sure 

91.68 93.95 B: i think that it was just the school system in general 

94.27 94.68 A: uh-huh 

94.48 96.20 B: has some major problems 

96.49 100.28 A: well there is so many different areas though i wonder if they would like us to 

100.93 101.38 A: um 

101.54 102.07 A: discuss 

102.67 103.39 A: specifics 

103.96 106.79 B: possibly i don't know this is my first time i've done this 

106.45 108.13 A: this is my first time also 

108.03 112.76 B: oh okay so we are both rookies um they don't give you a lot of coaching but um 

113.09 114.01 B: um my guess 

114.10 120.30 B: i don't know is you know pretty much anything we decide to talk about i don't know what state you are from but right now oregon has 

119.30 119.97 A: tennessee 

120.07 121.31 A: oh i'm sorry tennessee 

121.30 121.84 B: tennessee 

122.10 123.03 B: oregon has 

123.86 125.47 B: some tremendous budget cuts 

125.70 133.09 B: they can't they the last governor didn't balance our budget properly and we were we were over-budget by uh i think (( )) or 

133.31 135.08 B: exceeding three hundred million 

135.04 135.43 A: uh-huh 

135.97 136.37 A: well 

136.07 138.53 B: and we just recently had a ballot measure to increase 

138.66 140.00 B: taxes and oregon is 

140.19 140.60 B: not 

141.26 143.93 B: supportive of increased taxes and it failed 

144.06 146.61 B: and they threatened that 

146.71 148.24 B: they would be taking it out 

148.66 149.59 B: on the schools 

149.89 152.34 B: the uh health care public health-care 

153.01 153.48 B: um 

153.60 155.37 B: we have a plan called the oregon health plan 

155.59 156.61 B: uh 

156.87 159.43 B: that helps the disabled and the elderly primarily 

160.22 160.72 B: um 

160.90 162.14 B: those less fortunate 

162.78 165.26 B: and also um on the public safety 

165.93 166.50 B: so 

167.00 170.30 B: and they followed through with that they immediately the day after started 

170.69 173.07 B: announcing school closures and days 

174.33 176.89 B: weeks being cut off of school years 

178.55 179.05 B: so 

179.34 179.61 B: that is 

180.41 180.69 A: that 

180.93 181.56 B: that is (( )) 

181.79 183.58 A: that is uh that could they 

183.88 184.38 A: um 

185.02 186.61 A: really a problem lighter um 

186.76 187.18 B: mhm 

190.83 191.15 A: take 

192.26 195.49 B: neither do neither does oregon i wondered what other state it was 

193.59 194.06 A: oregon 

195.43 199.05 A: oh okay well i think there is quite a few maybe i i i 

196.04 196.64 B: tennessee 

198.56 200.16 B: no state tax or sales tax 

200.79 201.71 A: state tax 

201.61 202.63 B: oh we have a state 

202.72 204.67 B: tax but we don't have a sales tax 

204.84 208.37 A: okay we have a sales tax of around nine percent 

208.35 210.71 B: yeah that is fairly high but not having a state tax 

211.86 212.49 B: definitely it 

212.67 214.03 B: offsets 

213.39 213.87 A: well 

214.31 216.79 A: in and just recently they voted in the lottery 

217.20 217.63 B: mhm 

217.48 220.86 A: and supposedly they are going to be taking all of that money for education 

222.06 224.65 A: so i don't really know i know um 

225.22 225.96 A: i believe 

226.15 228.35 A: tennessee has it is up there 

228.70 230.97 A: it uh n- it is not near the top 

231.38 232.13 A: of uh 

233.19 233.68 A: salary 

234.05 234.79 B: mhm 

234.56 235.02 A: but it 

235.38 237.45 A: uh it is higher than surrounding 

237.76 238.15 A: states 

238.47 239.07 A: to it 

239.51 240.01 B: mhm 

240.04 240.86 A: it pays more 

241.40 241.92 A: um 

243.40 244.14 A: i just think 

244.51 244.93 A: um 

246.82 248.87 A: uh i do hope that 

248.98 252.01 A: this lottery that they have passed is not going to be 

252.12 252.99 A: more trouble than it 

253.38 253.84 A: worse 

254.25 254.75 B: mhm 

255.08 261.33 B: we we have a lottery we've had a oregon state lottery for quite some time and i mean i don't know how 

260.51 261.80 A: does the bulk of it go 

261.90 263.53 A: to uh education 

270.00 272.36 B: is not i don't see it as a problem i think 

272.44 274.56 B: more of it should go to the education 

275.35 277.36 B: um i'm not really sure how it 

278.01 278.57 B: uh 

279.21 281.03 B: how it is broken down 

281.52 286.30 B: as to you know who gets to decide what percentage or where what portion goes here or there 

286.90 289.62 B: but they do have it it does help to support the schools but 

289.86 291.67 B: like i said we don't have 

291.78 293.88 B: other things to support them so 

294.83 298.71 A: i'm a little concerned too there's something i heard on the news a week two weeks ago 

299.32 300.87 A: uh concerning um 

301.40 302.59 A: the lottery that 

303.19 304.59 A: that um 

305.28 306.19 A: possibly 

307.03 310.85 A: organized crime has something to do with these lotteries in some of these states 

311.22 312.10 B: oh really 

312.27 314.02 A: uh yes i haven't looked in to it 

314.15 314.88 A: i haven't uh 

322.50 324.55 A: i caught at maybe at the end of uh 

324.97 325.42 A: of 

325.63 326.31 A: some maybe 

326.44 329.16 A: something like twenty twenty or sixty minutes something one of those 

329.38 329.72 B: hm 

329.98 330.47 A: so 

330.75 331.63 A: um i'm 

332.27 334.56 A: it's just something that's twigged my interest 

334.88 339.52 B: yeah i would be curious about that part of my background is i used to work for the 

339.86 342.81 B: police bureau in a c- for a while 

341.39 341.68 A: oh 

343.65 345.24 B: uh eh five years 

345.59 347.74 B: i was i'm surprised that you said that it kind of shocked me 

347.99 348.33 A: oh 

348.28 349.23 B: but um 

348.91 351.44 A: i- just you know well the lottery isn't 

351.59 353.96 A: being around for a long long time and most 

354.49 357.46 A: you know a lot of states i mean and some states um it probably has been around 

355.09 355.73 B: yeah 

357.33 360.79 B: yeah i can't remember when they took it in i mean i 

358.98 359.33 A: okay 

361.71 364.48 B: i remember but i don't remember how long ago it was 

364.63 367.75 A: well it was it was really uh a lot of people uh tried 

364.65 365.14 B: um 

367.88 368.21 A: to 

368.61 370.29 A: block the lottery but it just 

370.40 372.49 A: barely it it it got in it 

372.70 373.75 A: it's been a couple of times 

375.81 382.68 B: it is pretty controlled and i'm sure they are going to be able to take it very quickly and very easily from another state and basically copy the procedure 

383.14 384.41 A: so it is like about a year and 

384.70 386.56 A: uh most of the money i think is 

386.68 387.27 A: so 

387.39 390.20 A: uh you are marked for education which uh 

390.25 394.55 B: well i think that will probably help i think they need to definitely increase like i said before our 

394.86 396.24 B: on our end our our 

397.09 397.96 B: um 

398.12 403.56 B: resources that go to the schools they need to rethink their priorities and stop 

404.17 409.10 B: you know so much planning departments and government waste we had 

410.26 410.99 B: um 

411.24 415.44 B: five special sessions this year to balance our budget and it got it was all hanging on the voters 

416.17 416.54 B: on this 

416.81 417.35 B: ballot that 

417.55 420.78 B: that just happened on january twenty eighth and failed and 

422.43 424.53 B: it just i think they need to prioritize 

425.21 425.84 B: and change their 

425.42 425.83 A: well they 

426.15 427.17 B: approach 

427.06 429.52 A: there there is also a large um 

430.46 430.96 A: um 

431.47 431.98 A: uh 

432.79 433.49 A: segment of 

433.82 434.59 A: young people

437.47 438.73 A: maybe they can um 

439.49 440.16 A: put some (( )) 

440.41 443.25 A: put some money in to trying to 

443.89 444.30 A: uh 

444.59 446.17 A: cancel against that 

446.72 447.70 B: is that in the state of 

447.80 448.59 B: uh tennessee 

449.03 449.68 B: really 

450.44 450.73 A: it w-

464.49 465.10 B: okay 

465.69 465.96 B: huh 

466.50 468.53 A: that could be one area where they might 

470.91 471.56 B: right 

472.26 473.46 B: right well 

473.58 474.52 B: i don't know i mean 

475.42 481.33 B: it's so hard to to say where where to get it from but they need to sit down and rethink 

478.45 479.00 A: i know 

481.99 482.46 B: things 

483.56 485.37 B: and redirect

492.46 496.28 B: public safety i mean we are going to be in trouble if we we don't have those people out there to 

496.79 497.48 B: save us 

498.89 499.16 B: but 

499.01 501.76 A: for later on we have the younger people coming up into
