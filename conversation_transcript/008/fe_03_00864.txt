63.02 64.41 A: um

67.62 70.88 A: like children um in school like 

71.05 72.91 A: um school um 

73.04 74.34 A: people should be 

74.73 77.88 A: um teachers should be more involved in 

78.05 78.58 A: um 

80.13 80.68 A: um 

80.89 84.60 A: like if children have problems in school like 

84.96 88.83 A: um like counselors or they should be able to help 

89.04 93.41 A: children through those problems and also i also 

93.62 94.11 A: um 

94.36 99.19 A: but say that there should be more uh security in schools 

101.59 102.86 B: i agree with that um 

103.22 105.64 B: yeah and maybe along with the security thing is to be 

106.15 108.03 B: uh some metal detectors in my home town 

110.22 111.29 B: prevent things that happen 

111.53 113.77 B: you know the school shootings and things like that 

117.54 118.91 B: i think that there should be more 

119.23 121.14 B: ex- extra curricular activities for students 

121.31 122.89 B: um not just academics but 

123.62 124.56 B: drama and 

125.71 126.25 B: music 

127.21 127.65 A: mhm 

128.25 128.96 B: clubs like that 

130.06 132.49 B: eh give them more of the uh well rounded education 

133.05 134.58 B: rather than just math and science 

135.65 137.36 B: math and science but also maybe other 

137.49 139.60 B: psychology and sociology 

139.77 141.10 B: topics that were offered in my school 

141.55 142.39 A: i see 

142.73 146.37 A: uh-huh i would also say also 

146.66 152.32 A: um a lot of the people a lot of the students out of high school some- somehow like 

152.52 155.30 A: the curriculum in college is much harder 

155.46 156.25 A: uh an- 

167.57 171.64 A: it seems like most of the students they experience a very 

171.76 178.35 A: big transition with their courses and learning um from high school to college 

179.59 182.51 B: yeah that's true and also um maybe prepare for 

183.53 186.74 B: standardized testing that gets you into college i know that a lot of 

187.18 188.01 B: lower economic 

189.52 191.96 B: sectors of the community don't have as much preparation 

192.26 192.79 A: mhm 

192.54 192.89 B: for 

193.42 195.00 B: uh standardized testing and also 

195.19 196.23 B: to go to college at all 

196.68 197.04 B: a lot of 

197.18 199.46 B: um is mostly for upper class 

199.60 200.43 A: mhm 

200.43 205.53 B: people that their education is better from the beginning so they're more competitive a lot of people but the affirmative action saying a lot of people say that 

207.22 207.65 A: mhm 

205.54 207.72 B: you know well if they can't 

207.94 210.29 B: they can't compete then they can't compete well do- 

210.62 211.61 B: i think that a lot of the 

213.69 217.34 B: the they're ill prepared from the very beginning so it's hard to even out the playing field that 

217.35 217.89 B: after 

218.73 220.24 B: your senior year in high school than it is 

220.74 221.54 B: back in kindergarten 

222.02 222.58 A: mhm 

222.88 230.00 A: um i would also say um like there'd be more um 

230.99 232.62 A: like um 

233.08 238.76 A: like and a lot of people they might not choose to go to college um 

239.13 241.90 A: i would say that if they can prepare 

242.07 243.62 A: s- uh people 

244.11 249.10 A: while in high school up to high school so that they can get a good job 

249.50 252.51 A: um and i would also say um 

252.74 254.55 A: like um 

255.24 255.98 A: in 

256.84 258.55 A: in college uh 

260.81 262.58 A: i forgot what i was going to say 

265.05 265.51 B: i think that 

266.21 266.70 B: um 

267.87 268.75 B: college 

268.92 270.63 B: as far as college goes that there's um 

271.18 272.00 B: i'm i go to a 

272.13 273.95 B: a public school for college and 

275.48 278.01 B: also not a lot of funding the tuition keeps going up and 

279.28 279.71 B: -s no 

280.31 282.28 B: uh we don't see any of it we don't see any 

282.42 284.62 B: newer things or more things offered 

285.67 286.86 B: and that it goes the same 

287.41 290.88 B: with high school and and younger grades the same as college it that they sh- 

291.10 292.09 B: they should offer more 

292.65 296.53 A: yeah definitely more government financial aid 

296.77 302.93 A: uh and grants um or make college much cheaper like maybe 

304.13 305.59 A: i don't know like maybe 

306.12 311.84 A: so that there's more funding and we don't have to pay that much for college 

312.25 312.88 A: um 

312.54 312.90 B: yeah 

313.56 313.81 B: that's 

314.23 315.97 B: true too and there's a lot of tax cuts that 

316.29 316.81 B: and that all 

317.28 318.12 B: i- it's great to have a- 

318.32 321.36 B: you know to have to pay less taxes but all the taxes that we pay go for 

321.73 324.71 B: things like schools an- and the community schools and education and 

325.10 326.68 B: those get cut along with taxes 

326.28 326.83 A: mhm 

327.94 334.57 A: um i just have um another um issue that i think that like in the high school um 

334.98 344.92 A: definitely there should be more preparation for a standardized test um maybe they should start in ninth grade because a lot of people they might 

345.03 356.92 A: be good students in high school but um they can't get into a college um because um of standardized tests um i just would 

357.81 360.35 A: well i could then or suggest that maybe 

360.55 364.36 A: the educational system could change that um 

364.53 365.41 A: or 

365.66 367.69 A: uh let people uh 

368.59 376.33 A: apply to college through grades rather than through just standardized tests so that more people can 

376.62 381.15 A: um attend college i don't know if that's a good idea or not 

382.11 384.22 B: yeah i would and when i in my high school 

385.02 386.39 B: we started preparation 

386.69 388.48 B: early like in late ninth grade 

388.79 389.32 A: mhm 

388.82 389.43 B: and we took a 

389.69 391.14 B: a preliminary s._a._t. 

391.26 392.89 B: just a practice one in the tenth grade 

393.25 396.09 B: and then we took the s._a._t. in eleventh grade and twelfth grade so just 

396.67 397.11 B: having 

398.11 401.46 B: multiple times that we'd take it and having preparation from ninth grade 

401.68 403.81 B: really did help a lot of our scores i know from 

404.78 409.33 B: preliminary test in tenth grade to the twelfth grade test our scores dramatically improved whereas if 

407.06 407.58 A: mhm 

410.00 412.99 B: i said i think it was more than just what you've learned i think it was also 

410.02 410.44 A: yeah 

413.12 414.40 B: the fact that we've taken it and ex- 

414.51 415.91 B: knew what to expect on the test 

416.17 416.75 A: mhm 

417.11 419.44 B: people's scores went up as much as two hundred three hundred points 

419.88 421.19 B: from what they originally got 

421.66 422.32 A: i see 

422.89 426.28 A: um do you know how long this um conversation has to be 

426.95 429.42 B: it's supposed to be ten minutes i'm not sure how long it's been 

430.08 432.26 A: okay so um you- 

432.42 435.65 A: everybody only gets three calls or 

436.00 438.73 A: -cause i'm reading the email and it says 

438.87 446.12 A: you may participate in up to three calls so is it if you don't get up to three calls they'll keep on calling you 

446.46 448.60 B: yeah i think it's up i think it's one to three calls 

448.96 453.62 A: oh okay and then that's that's all you can participate from this 

453.77 455.65 A: this survey thing 

455.85 457.34 B: they had another thing that 

457.47 458.96 B: questioned (( whether you're not )) um 

459.22 459.53 B: (( )) 

459.90 463.13 B: you wanted to participate in a lot more and that you checked it on when you 

463.48 463.96 B: signed up 

464.16 464.96 A: oh okay 

464.69 465.69 B: so a little choice 

465.95 468.09 B: box other than that i think it's up to three 

466.38 466.84 A: i see 

468.49 469.17 A: i see 

469.83 470.21 A: -kay 

471.32 473.87 B: i'm not sure th- if they interrupt us after ten minutes or 

480.65 483.03 A: so i'm not sure so it's 

483.67 485.79 A: um ten dollars per call 

485.97 488.14 B: yeah but i think you actually have to talk for ten minutes 

486.02 486.96 A: i think that's what's 

488.26 489.73 A: oh okay 

489.88 491.79 B: we can i mean just keep going just to make sure 

492.10 501.71 A: yeah -cause i i want to make sure -cause my last call i think only lasted five minutes -cause otherwise they'll keep on calling and calling 

502.15 503.24 A: oh 

502.26 502.75 B: yeah 

503.70 505.65 A: uh what else um 

507.41 508.25 A: um 

510.62 511.77 A: i think um 

512.34 517.37 A: i would s- i think i would say like for public schools maybe um they 

518.06 522.21 A: and the educational system today for public schools 

522.32 522.66 A: like 

522.92 528.32 A: i went to a public school and i don't think public school's education is 

528.62 538.56 A: um as well prepared as going to a private school's maybe like there would be suggestions for a more 

538.76 548.08 A: college level classes starting in high school because when i went to a public school i didn't learn like statistics 

548.19 552.24 A: or sociology or economics 

552.43 553.30 A: um i just 

553.56 555.20 A: think like maybe these 

555.48 559.19 A: essential skills could be offered in the educational system 

560.66 563.43 B: yeah i think that's true i think also it probably depends on 

563.90 564.28 B: um 

564.63 570.39 B: what public school what private school because my pub- i went to a public school but it was really really good it was one of the top twenty five in the country
