4.84 8.35 B: hi bonnie what do you think about great [mn] 

6.23 7.36 A: how're you 

8.40 11.18 A: um i don't know what do you think of it 

12.74 20.25 B: well i ah they just say you can go back and change one thing in time or can you travel in time any way or 

19.93 26.24 A: i don't know see i'd like to go back and see things i don't know if i want to personally revisit my past you know 

26.73 30.07 A: um is there one thing that you would change 

30.04 37.73 B: i don't think there is anything i would change in my life you know i've had my bad times and i've had my good times but it makes me who i am 

30.23 31.63 A: about yourself 

37.45 45.95 A: that's what i always figured you know now if it was an opportunity to go back you know way back in time or something or forward that might be something else 

45.76 50.20 B: yeah or if you could go back and change something maybe like nine eleven or 

49.81 50.94 A: right 

50.30 54.55 B: or or get hitler before he did all his bad stuff or 

54.83 55.71 B: but 

55.11 59.65 A: yeah and see how much that would change everything from then on down 

60.60 62.05 B: (( yeah i- i- [mn] )) 

62.51 67.59 B: it's kind of mind bo- i mean i- i- it could never be done but [mn] 

67.68 70.42 A: right um do you 

69.22 71.92 B: i personally wouldn't change nothing in my life 

72.07 81.17 A: i don't think i would either i i mean even when you say well i wished i wouldn't have done that or something like that if you really think about it you wouldn't be where you are now 

80.32 82.83 B: exactly right 

81.52 86.35 A: right if you wouldn't have made the decisions whether they were [laughter] right or wrong 

85.96 86.79 B: [laughter] 

87.28 89.73 B: so how long do we have to talk about this 

89.53 90.91 A: ten minutes 

90.41 92.67 B: okay keep it [laughter] 

92.91 94.25 A: well i gue- 

93.08 93.98 B: i mean 

94.48 95.58 A: i don't know 

94.54 95.47 B: i'm sorry 

95.59 96.69 A: oh go ahead 

96.44 97.24 B: (( mm )) 

97.56 99.42 B: [sigh] no i was listening to you 

99.31 106.03 A: oh um do you like like time travel like thinking about it like with movies and books and stuff or are 

106.04 111.83 B: oh yeah back to the future was kind of i mean a fun movie escapist and stuff like that i 

106.31 107.12 A: you 

109.81 111.01 A: yeah 

112.34 114.15 B: i mean phew 

114.74 116.46 B: but i 

116.93 122.96 B: i don't know it it just it's definitely impossible [mn] it would be impossible but 

123.43 128.90 A: yeah right because you then you run into that all that paradox stuff that they're always talking about you know 

127.95 128.78 B: mm 

128.98 134.22 A: if you go back and change something then it changes everything or would it or could it or 

134.45 135.78 A: [lipsmack] i don't know 

135.48 143.59 B: [laughter] it's kind of fun talking about but then when you start thinking about it jeeze 

144.12 145.19 B: (( [lipsmack] i don't know )) 

146.64 147.23 B: (( [mn] )) 

146.66 153.15 A: yeah it would be interesting like to go back and see like the pyramids being built or something like that but 

151.84 160.16 B: oh yeah that that's true you could go back and see how the universe was put together and everything you could 

159.59 160.69 A: right 

161.04 161.84 B: you 

161.08 163.54 A: if you could just be a spectator i guess 

163.28 164.76 B: right 

165.17 174.76 B: you could see everything and know everything that's that's real there would be no specula- i mean who shot kennedy wha- what happened and 

174.83 180.44 A: yeah that's true yeah um yeah buy i._b._m. stock way back when 

179.73 181.62 B: (( you know oh yeah )) 

180.63 183.18 A: [laughter] or whatever 

181.66 189.07 B: [laughter] i'm trying to figure out now what kind of stocks to buy so maybe i should have sh- should wish i could do that 

187.13 188.89 A: oh yeah 

189.04 190.89 A: [mn] i don't know 

189.46 191.09 B: yeah that'd be great 

192.32 197.40 A: well at least time travel's better than talking about wall street for me or something 'cause 

195.57 201.56 B: ah [laughter] that's one of my passions i'm sorry i'm not doing well but 

199.21 200.40 A: [mn] oh 

201.27 203.91 A: oh so you would have been better at that huh 

204.04 205.53 A: (( talking about that )) 

205.36 208.54 B: oh i'd love to talk about that well 

207.27 208.77 A: yeah see i don't 

208.98 212.17 B: they didn't offer me that they just called me and said this 

211.93 214.83 A: i guess every day it's a different topic 'cause 

213.85 215.99 B: oh oh oh 

215.25 224.77 A: um the lady that told me about this she had wall street and she basically had nothing to say for ten minutes which [sigh] probably would be about what i'm 

225.53 238.85 B: oh well i could have talked enough for both of us believe me [laughter] not good talk though lately i mean the last three years have been terrible but [lipsmack] but time travel would have been great for that or even just 

225.86 226.85 A: like 

228.13 229.30 A: oh really 

229.71 230.70 A: yeah 

237.98 238.94 A: yeah 

239.57 244.79 B: yeah th- that's about the only way because they're talking about going back not forward right 

242.69 243.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

244.47 248.35 A: yeah that's what it seems to be just in your own life you know 

247.92 249.31 B: yeah 

248.77 251.33 A: so that kind of wraps that up pretty quick 

251.11 257.84 B: yeah but that could make us that could could have made everyb- anybody that could do it a very rich person but 

257.32 258.96 A: really yeah 

259.71 262.81 A: in any number of ways really yeah 

261.37 262.35 B: yeah 

262.81 263.97 B: [sigh] for sure 

263.97 271.17 A: you could tell when the stock market was coming you know to an abrupt you know sell or whatever and 

271.18 273.96 A: [lipsmack] make you know save your money that way too 

273.92 281.17 B: [mn] you could sell short and make money that way and do all kinds of things there's ways to play the market both ways 

278.73 279.52 A: (( [mn] )) 

281.09 290.14 A: okay so if we could change that i might change that [laughter] [laughter] but of course then we'd be you know on different paths anyway so 

283.56 285.77 B: [laughter] 

290.16 303.54 B: well i think it would be boring to be able to go back and change something then you wouldn't you'd you'd know exactly the outcome and [sigh] to me life the fun of it is you know not knowing what's gonna happen now it's not all grand but [mn] 

304.70 311.43 A: [mn] right and meeting the people that you meet and you know even the bad stuff y- you learn stuff from that sometimes 

310.48 311.93 B: exactly 

311.69 316.94 A: bigger [mn] you know things than you do from the good stuff 

317.21 323.51 A: makes you think and make decisions [noise] that you wouldn't have had to contemplate making so 

323.35 330.15 B: oh i agree with that i think i've learned a lot more from the things that went wrong than th- that have gone good 

329.67 333.55 A: yeah now that's kind of a sad statement but it's true isn't it [laughter] 

332.56 336.88 B: yeah yeah sad but [laughter] 

338.20 340.98 A: probably 'cause those are the things that um 

341.07 343.75 A: you know bring us to the realization of 

344.01 347.70 A: [mn] what life is all about and what we could lose and what you know 

347.81 350.33 A: can change in a minute and stuff so 

350.15 351.99 B: yeah 

351.13 354.84 A: i guess the happy times are easier just to coast through 

355.14 368.53 B: yeah from the books i've read that's the happy times you wanna wanna party and just have a good time and the the the bad times you kind of sit and ponder about and think oh what went wrong and you learn more from it but 

368.18 369.21 A: yeah 

368.50 371.69 B: i'd still pick the good over the bad [laughter] but [mn] 

371.00 372.64 A: well yeah yeah 

373.05 375.69 A: i don't know that would be interesting though um [mn] 

376.49 377.48 A: no i 

377.49 383.39 A: even now just you know trying to think one thing and i still can't think of anything that i would change 

386.09 395.07 B: i can't think of anything i have five beautiful healthy children i'm [mn] happily married and [mn] i can't see it any other way 

394.96 395.98 A: yeah 

394.99 404.64 B: [laughter] we work our butts off and struggle to get by but but we do a lot of laughing and having fun we have bad times but i can't think of one thing i'd change [mn] yeah 

404.82 410.13 A: yeah and you've got your whole family and who knows what that would change about that so 

410.32 416.15 B: maybe get a more education be smarter when i was in college or something like that but 

410.60 411.85 A: yeah that's true 

415.62 419.89 A: oh yeah i coulda definitely done that a little less partying and a little more studying [laughter] 

418.65 420.91 B: [laughter] 

421.41 423.45 A: yeah that's true 

423.19 424.77 B: but then you know 

425.17 431.67 B: i might not have been working where i was working when i met my wife i ma- might have been working somewhere else and 

431.43 434.18 A: right so everything changes 

433.48 434.93 B: yeah i [mn] 

435.08 439.63 B: it would totally change your life if you could travel back and change one thing i believe 

440.31 443.30 B: [mn] and i'm not sure i'd want to change anything like that 

440.63 441.39 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

442.97 455.14 A: i don't think so either um the only time i've ever thought about travelling in time would be like big things you know to go back like you said and change something that you know created history or something or 

455.28 459.75 A: see something happening but that doesn't necessarily i'd mean 

460.10 465.41 A: you'd even wanna change that to a certain extent because who knows how that would affect everything 

464.92 467.77 B: yeah right huh 

468.72 469.87 B: jeeze 

471.37 476.70 B: [mn] yeah so seems like we agree are we supposed to fight on this or are we supposed 

476.05 477.78 A: i have no idea 

477.00 480.45 B: [laughter] is this the first one you've ever done 

478.02 479.01 A: um 

480.15 482.72 A: yes i just signed up this morning

485.96 489.08 B: [laughter] actually i didn't sign up till this afternoon so

500.74 504.42 A: oh yeah i signed up from five to eight so you must be

519.58 524.39 B: hey yeah well nothing bad happened [laughter] 

521.11 523.10 A: [laughter] so apparently 

523.61 525.78 A: oh okay well that's good 

526.47 527.84 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

528.44 529.51 A: (( i don't know )) 

529.10 532.42 B: we haven't talked for ten minutes yet [laughter] do they tell us 

532.63 540.27 A: i imagine i guess the computer breaks in from what um the girl told me i guess it abruptly ends it i don't know 

537.46 538.59 B: (( oh )) 

539.83 540.72 B: (( oh )) 

540.72 541.66 A: (( so )) 

542.66 551.49 B: well i wish i could set back time [mn] so we could do this all over again it's been a pleasure talking to you for sure just in case they cut us off quick 

549.29 550.48 A: (( [lipsmack] [mn] yeah )) 

551.25 553.67 A: okay yeah it's interesting anyway 

553.00 554.77 B: yeah 

553.76 557.39 A: and i'm glad you've had a good life that you don't wanna change that's nice 

557.59 560.74 B: well i'd be i'd be afraid [mn] you know 

560.38 561.79 A: yeah i would too 

560.90 567.82 B: i've had hard times and we've had hard times and you know it's been a struggle to raise five kids and all that but 

564.73 565.67 A: (( well )) 

568.81 570.95 B: (( [sigh] [cough] but all in all )) 

571.20 573.79 B: [mn] i have nothing really to regret 

575.59 577.49 A: that's nice to hear anyway 

575.94 579.24 B: even if i could change anything i i don't think i would [mn] 

580.89 586.69 B: if that's what they want me to talk about but if i could change something in history i might be willing to do that 

585.72 588.19 A: [noise] yeah i might do that too 

588.09 592.18 B: even though you said then you don't know what else would have happened then so 

588.21 589.11 A: you know 

591.51 597.00 A: yeah you know i mean for every for every cause there's an effect so you know 

593.24 594.23 B: if you wou- 

595.73 596.72 B: right 

596.94 599.89 B: so if you would have prevented nine eleven maybe
