22.45 23.35 B: um 

23.84 25.41 A: know what i would do 

25.43 27.72 B: i think i would change um 

28.47 30.89 B: i'd have my kids closer together 

31.72 35.05 B: because i have one that's fourteen and one that's seven 

35.62 38.44 B: and there's quite a gap [laughter] 

37.02 39.46 A: yeah mine are seven three and two 

39.72 42.74 B: oh [laughter] that's not a real big gap 

42.34 45.66 A: no mine are kind of close 

45.91 47.45 B: (( i don't know )) 

47.85 50.73 B: it would be interesting to be able to do that though 

50.38 52.87 A: yeah it would be cool 

53.37 54.98 A: (( i don't know what i would do )) 

55.37 56.51 A: (( i don't know )) 

56.33 58.44 B: well there's bound to be something 

58.19 60.95 A: i would probably which i'm sure she knew 

61.52 63.52 A: but i would make sure 

64.09 66.83 A: that like when my mom died 

67.04 70.31 A: that she absolutely positively knew 

70.92 72.20 A: that i love her 

72.29 73.50 B: oh 

73.57 75.20 A: that would be i mean 

75.84 77.96 A: i know she knew but like 

77.86 79.58 B: were you a teenager 

79.10 82.12 A: no it was last year but she was like 

83.12 85.96 A: you know she couldn't understand anything then 

85.67 89.20 B: yeah that would be hard 

88.14 92.48 A: and i would make sure before i guess that that she knew for sure you know 

93.44 95.80 B: do you think you spent enough time 

95.37 99.43 A: yeah no [laughter] [laughter] no not at all 

96.00 96.77 B: (( with her )) 

97.51 98.22 B: (( no )) 

99.90 100.85 A: (( no )) 

100.99 104.81 B: i think that's a big thing i think if you could go back 

104.82 108.80 B: that's the thing i think if i could back i would spend more time 

109.66 113.87 B: see my son's fourteen i think i would spend more time like 

114.16 117.19 B: with him at while he was littler 

116.46 117.90 A: yeah 

117.79 127.60 B: because i feel like i did while we were going through it but now that he's a teenager it's wow [laughter] they grow up so fast that 

122.63 127.82 A: (( teenager yeah i know )) 

128.05 130.35 B: may be more vacations 

130.93 134.19 A: (( yeah )) 

132.12 134.62 B: that would be a plus but 

134.95 137.64 B: that would be hard to have your mom pass away 

137.76 139.77 A: yeah it's not easy 

138.15 140.20 B: (( and )) 

140.18 141.61 A: (( not at all )) 

142.40 146.32 B: would you change getting married or anything like that 

147.28 148.51 A: i don't know 

148.17 149.38 B: [laughter] 

150.46 156.34 B: we can talk about anything because like nobody we know's going to know [laughter] 

154.78 156.47 A: she didn't um 

156.63 160.08 A: she didn't want me to get married but i don't know 

161.43 165.60 B: i think i would have changed i could would change maybe we eloped i 

165.58 167.30 A: that's what we did 

166.80 170.84 B: think maybe i would go back and have the wedding and the pictures 

170.14 173.16 A: yeah that would be nice 

172.56 175.55 B: yeah that's probably 

175.88 179.72 B: i think i'd change a lot of things [laughter] 

177.92 189.36 A: i probably would too you get to thirty and start thinking wow i did that wrong and this wrong if i could go back i'd really change it is this the first survey you did 

185.56 187.13 B: yeah 

188.78 190.11 B: yeah 

189.48 199.00 A: i haven't i couldn't get my doggone pin number they were calling me and i ran and i didn't know what it was and i finally called 'em and said i need my pin number 

193.36 195.91 B: [laughter] 

199.49 202.60 B: yeah i was on hold for a while and i was sitting here thinking 

202.69 206.32 B: 'cause it just said that we would be discussing time travel and i thought 

206.29 220.89 B: i'd like to go ahead in time and see what my kids would be living what kind of how what the world would be like when they're you know older and have children not necessarily to to see what was going on 

209.31 212.53 A: what's going to happen yeah 

221.04 224.56 B: in their life but just to see like what the world was like 

224.34 225.78 A: i can't imagine 

225.21 228.01 B: because it seems like everything's such a mess 

227.49 231.46 A: i know it seems like each year it gets worse and worse 

231.01 233.63 B: yeah yeah it does 

234.18 237.60 B: i think i'd go back and get a better education too 

237.29 241.28 A: i think i would do that i wished i would have went to college 

239.96 241.10 B: me too 

241.43 242.79 B: (( what )) 

241.54 244.51 A: i should have 

242.82 247.10 B: yeah me too but then i opted are you a stay at home mom 

247.26 255.70 A: no i work but 

250.10 254.43 B: i opted you know i wanted to stay home with the kids but 

254.71 256.60 B: and i'm glad i did but 

257.32 260.15 B: you know you see kids that their parents work and they're 

260.93 268.23 B: doing great and i'm here i've got one that i'm involved with everything he does and he's failing eighth grade [laughter] 

262.09 263.09 A: (( i guess )) 

267.57 273.26 A: (( he asked me my son asked me the other day if you could go back in time would have of had )) 

270.42 271.98 B: (( well it just )) 

272.22 274.56 B: (( depends on the )) 

274.65 277.90 B: (( kid i guess [laughter] and )) 

277.17 278.92 A: (( me oh )) 

278.39 282.22 B: i said well yes your problems are not you know 

282.78 283.92 B: you don't just 

284.23 289.72 B: change but i really think i would have had my kids closer together but that would probably be 

287.86 288.84 A: (( yeah i know )) 

290.74 295.54 B: [sigh] probably be if i could just go back and change one thing 

292.49 300.78 A: because 

297.20 300.04 B: [sigh] that would probably be it 

301.07 303.39 B: 'cause having you know another one 

304.53 309.88 B: closer that'd be hard if they could tell you you could only go back and change one thing 

310.17 314.30 A: you'd have to really think about it 

312.34 314.13 B: yeah 

314.40 316.00 A: it would be difficult 

315.79 317.51 B: yeah 

316.45 318.24 A: i still think it would be 

318.50 319.84 A: i think i would 

320.52 322.84 A: have spent more time with my mother 

322.92 324.86 A: appreciated her which i 

323.88 325.57 B: yeah 

324.91 338.74 A: did appreciate her you know what i mean a lot more than a lot of people i talk to that's my age the way they talk about their mothers i never [laughter] talked my mom like that but and that's the way my mom was and you know 

333.04 337.19 B: oh yeah yeah my mom's like my best friend in the world 

339.21 341.61 A: i don't know i just feel like 

343.76 347.24 A: i wished i could have you know knew for sure 

347.40 350.78 B: did she have a brain injury or something 

350.21 353.47 A: she had um she had had breast cancer 

354.37 359.54 A: and she and it spread all over her body and then she had like 

357.61 358.73 B: oh 

359.60 361.55 A: ten tumors in her brain 

361.55 363.36 B: oh 

363.63 366.92 A: it hit her really fast i mean she got it and then 

367.94 369.72 A: she just all of a sudden 

370.83 372.70 A: she was really sick 

373.49 374.99 A: and it was hard on her 

374.75 376.31 B: oh th- how old are you 

376.15 377.95 A: i'm twenty eight 

377.36 380.28 B: i'm thirty five i'll be thirty six 

379.68 381.42 A: she was fifty 

381.29 383.62 B: oh that's so young 

383.22 389.64 A: she just turned fifty and she um she's very close to my oldest daughter they used to watch her 

390.15 394.39 A: my parents when she was little so my two youngest they were two 

394.12 395.90 B: and your daughter's seven 

395.57 408.56 A: yeah it was very hard they were extremely close yeah she misses her she's very close to her and my dad just got remarried and that's been hard on us too 

396.05 399.21 B: yeah my daughter's seven and i can't imagine 

400.47 402.58 B: it probably still is 

409.24 412.32 B: you know i bet when if she grows up 

412.48 418.13 B: she will probably say if she could go back she wouldn't want her grandma to pass away 

417.77 419.18 A: probably so 

418.73 419.50 B: (( you know )) 

419.58 421.16 B: i mean really 

420.45 435.28 A: she was very close to her very close and that's the thing with me i think you know if i could change things i'd rather my mom be [laughter] here to take care of my kids than me i feel like she could be so much a better mom i always thought i could be like her 

430.37 432.01 B: (( yeah ))

435.57 441.68 B: yeah yeah yeah i have i have moments like that too [laughter] 

440.52 449.98 A: yeah 'cause 'cause she was so patient and never hollered or never yelled at us and just always looked at the best in everything 

450.04 454.06 B: did she raise you herself or d- was your dad around 

452.57 454.46 A: no my dad was there

495.48 498.01 A: (( right that's kind of )) 

496.87 503.41 B: it kind of would be like you know have a little bit more res- i would be like have a little more respect for my mother

505.88 506.85 A: (( thing ))
