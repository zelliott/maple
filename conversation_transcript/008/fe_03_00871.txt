58.35 60.63 B: i if it's what i'm thinking of 

60.56 61.04 A: mhm 

61.40 64.03 B: i i really don't think it's a good idea 

64.61 67.52 B: uh if people are placed in the position just 

67.64 68.47 B: because 

68.79 69.91 B: they're a minority 

69.66 70.25 A: mhm 

70.88 76.25 B: um i i think it causes resentment with the rest of the employees 

75.93 76.44 A: mhm 

76.92 79.75 B: um i don't really think it helps that person 

80.20 82.94 B: um i think they'd be under a lot of s- more stress 

83.63 91.62 B: strained uh you know um attitude from other people resentment i think it would be harder on the individual too 

91.92 95.09 A: i would be i would tend to agree with that almost like a spotlight on them 

95.14 98.50 B: yes i think so i i really don't think it would be helping them at all 

98.51 101.41 A: i think back in the beginning maybe when it was started 

101.63 108.70 A: there there was a a solid purpose and i and i think it was necessary when affirmative action was first introduced 

108.87 113.14 A: as as being you know a policy that people should participate in 

113.44 115.16 A: but i worry now after 

115.67 118.62 A: twenty five years or so that it's used 

118.87 121.06 A: sometimes more as a manipulation tool 

121.78 125.52 B: boy i couldn't have put it better i agree with you there i think i think you're right there 

126.38 133.89 B: and um i i don't think it's uh i don't think it's necessary anymore there's uh i think there's a lot more opportunity now 

134.33 141.98 B: well maybe not in this year or last or part of last year because of the economy but in generalities there's been more opportunities in the last 

137.42 137.81 A: right 

142.56 144.07 B: so many years as there was 

144.21 146.32 B: you know maybe twenty five thirty years ago 

145.66 146.09 A: mhm 

146.72 151.75 B: and i think that's for that covers the whole spectrum of uh minorities and 

151.88 153.16 B: females and 

153.46 154.75 B: you know everybody 

154.71 159.33 A: i work for um the state of ohio so i- so i'm 

160.00 160.90 A: i guess i've always 

161.09 168.26 A: cautiously been aware of balance being tried to be maintained but i think i think there's a difference of um 

169.39 170.56 A: private versus state 

171.22 174.62 A: yeah the private sector businesses versus the government 

174.87 176.20 A: state type jobs 

176.65 179.50 B: uh yeah i w- i would think so 

179.84 180.52 B: i'm not 

180.75 182.64 B: really familiar with the state 

182.81 189.43 B: you know our government's the hiring type policies that uh do they have to have what i hate to use the word but quotas 

183.79 184.26 A: mhm 

189.89 191.45 B: for females quotas for 

190.18 190.54 A: well 

191.95 192.82 B: minorities 

201.30 204.86 A: eh no we're not under any guidelines other than t- 

206.86 211.01 A: the types of interview questions that we ask are not uh 

213.99 214.32 B: right 

218.33 218.74 A: uh 

219.76 228.74 A: gender sexual preferences uh anything about their religious beliefs uh we just we just have to be very careful not to touch on any of those topics 

228.84 236.96 A: but in no way shape or form do we receive any kind of directive about you know you must consider x. y. and z. candidates 

237.54 244.74 A: in order to meet some kind of a quota system i mean tha- so i'm not actually sure tha- i- that we even have a solid affirmative action program 

245.44 246.88 A: in place right now 

247.40 248.59 A: but i know it's it's it's 

248.91 250.01 A: been a part of 

251.61 253.06 A: you know our lives for so long i mean 

255.74 256.22 A: i guess 

257.02 262.57 A: i mean i always thought that one should be maintained anyway but then i'm not i'm not a minority so i'm i'm 

262.88 266.39 B: i you know i have thought of that too from the minorities' side 

266.59 271.71 B: i can see where um affirmative action would be maybe a good thing in some areas 

266.73 267.13 A: right 

272.20 272.66 A: right 

279.56 280.10 A: right 

280.81 281.11 B: too 

281.41 293.31 B: but then we go back to the resentments of the rest of the employees but i- if nothing else if they could get by this stress and and uh that type of thing they might be able to uh start a career or in other ways if it wasn't 

295.31 295.74 A: right 

296.62 306.30 B: but uh it just seems to me like now there are so many more opportunities as far as schooling and so on and so forth that more people are um 

306.55 315.14 B: able to go i think because of the uh i think they've loosened all up i'm not sure right now but i always thought that they had loosened up student loans and so on 

315.08 315.72 A: right 

315.98 317.27 A: well i i agree wi- 

316.23 317.92 B: so that more people could do it 

318.03 326.64 A: right i i do agree with you i think i think that we live in an age where there is more opportunity and i think part of that opportunity probably is in place because of 

327.27 330.68 A: what was originally right originally started but 

327.50 328.31 B: affirmative action 

330.78 332.79 A: i don't i don't think 

333.79 336.50 A: i've worked for the state for now like twenty one years and 

337.64 347.20 A: back when i first started i remembered it was very much in place but i was you know like twenty twenty one and and those decisions i wasn't part of that decision making process 

347.32 347.87 A: um 

348.91 349.33 A: but 

357.68 359.13 A: followed properly but 

360.41 361.24 A: excuse me 

361.35 361.76 A: um 

362.44 363.41 A: so i don't 

364.34 367.83 A: i don't know i thi- i'm when i said i wasn't part of a minority i'm i'm 

367.99 372.50 A: technically not but i'm entering into a part of a m- minority in that being 

372.74 378.50 A: the disabled so i w- i wonder sometimes you know how much that plays part 

378.97 379.89 A: for myself 

379.15 390.97 B: you i don't i don't think of that and i should that is inclusive in with i guess when you talk about uh uh affirmative action i guess it's disabilities is included i don't think of it that way i think of it just 

381.49 381.95 A: you don't 

382.28 382.82 A: okay 

392.24 392.62 B: and 

392.85 395.81 B: what has always burned me and me i'm sure a lot of females 

395.86 396.33 A: mhm 

396.21 398.92 B: is that i- we were considered a minority 

398.97 399.57 A: very true 

400.05 403.30 B: you and i- i've always hated how they lump us with 

403.74 406.10 B: uh oh say for example blacks and females 

406.02 406.47 A: mhm 

406.70 408.64 B: you've hear- i've heard that phrase so many times 

408.49 408.92 A: right 

409.29 414.90 B: you know and i don't think it's so unfair uh i don't think women are a minority i i 

415.07 417.51 B: think we're there's more of us on the planet than there are of men 

417.20 421.57 A: well i think we're considered a minority but i agree with you we are not 

419.66 421.64 B: we are and i still don't understand why 

421.68 424.27 A: but we're also not in the power 

424.80 430.49 A: enough in the power structures to make that thought process change enough yet but but i think it's happening 

431.04 434.21 B: i think i could get on that subject and and probably go on for quite awhile 

434.81 438.77 B: that's not what we're sup- that's not what we're supposed 

435.78 443.55 A: i'm listening well no but it is but it's related because i mean it's about perceptions of people and and and 

443.77 448.58 A: who's who's best candidate and appropriate and who's got the best qualifications 

448.87 457.81 B: yes you're right and that's it is part of it and uh i i've always gotten aggravated too because a lot of times i think women get passed over 

458.26 459.33 B: for promotions and things 

458.86 459.39 A: mhm 

459.63 461.08 B: just because they are a woman 

462.00 468.06 B: you know and uh and they get lo- lesser pay in a lot of instances for the same jobs that men 

462.49 463.10 A: right 

467.65 468.00 A: right 

468.18 468.43 B: um 

468.58 474.01 B: and that has always burned me because i've seen a lot of women who are a lot more intelligent than a lot of the men i've met 

474.78 475.18 B: you know 

475.28 475.91 A: i used to 

475.48 477.72 B: and it just doesn't seem to wash right 

477.44 477.87 A: yeah 

484.03 488.13 A: uh there was a discussion uh round table discussion type thing on 

488.23 492.41 A: um how veterinarians were not eh this their 

492.68 498.29 A: pay rates their annual incomes were were starting to drop and it was brought up that 

498.42 502.13 A: you know now that women were the majority of the graduate 

502.84 507.82 A: of veterinary medicine it was thought that that was playing a major factor in that 

508.46 512.02 A: i mean but they're still every bit as much professional having to meet every dead- 

512.76 521.09 A: as many you know goals and and steps as as the males so it was just an interesting perspective that you know uh a profession like that would would 

522.23 523.50 A: women would be 

523.99 525.41 B: would bring the the uh 

525.89 527.66 B: the pay down basically 

525.93 528.36 A: earning income down right right 

529.42 529.98 A: (( i just thought )) 

529.53 530.43 B: that's terrible 

530.32 531.12 A: how bizarre 

531.86 534.87 B: it is it's well it's beyond that but you know 

535.61 538.47 B: i i don't understand why they the 

538.73 539.82 B: the powers that be 

540.17 541.88 B: think just because you're female you're not 

542.19 545.90 B: as capable or as intelligent and i think a lot of times women are a little more capable 

542.30 542.68 A: right 

546.53 547.44 B: you know i think if they're 

547.58 548.24 B: i should well 

548.36 552.85 B: i think if maybe we ever get a woman president we things might be a little better too 

553.15 556.84 A: i i just happened to be mentioning to somebody this this uh 

556.97 558.85 A: this uh friday about uh 

559.38 562.14 A: how if women were in control in our current situation
