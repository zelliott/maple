40.42 47.79 B: go back in time and change something oh dear 

50.17 55.46 B: i don't know i mean i guess it's a question of whether it is something that you can actually physically change or whether it is something 

56.37 57.12 B: you just would 

57.71 58.91 B: want to change right 

59.61 61.72 A: yeah did you ever watch that show where

97.12 99.41 A: ach 

100.01 107.39 A: i don't know i'm thinking about like that day my husband drove my brand new van in the snowy weather and then

182.65 184.45 B: yeah no no no no but i mean 

185.05 187.79 B: you know uh most of them made it out 

188.05 191.59 B: but it was just interesting because they were t- like telling people to go back in- 

191.70 193.02 B: -side and stuff like that 

193.32 194.63 A: really 

193.79 196.75 B: yeah it was actually really cra- yeah but like 

195.13 195.79 A: huh 

197.24 200.93 B: after the first uh plane hit 

201.12 209.47 B: you know they were just like okay well the you know the building is made to withstand this don't worry about it we need you know like we don't they didn't want to cause like a you know 

210.01 210.49 A: right 

210.25 215.64 B: well like a commotion so they their people they told everyone to go back inside and like 

215.40 216.52 A: ew 

215.83 219.98 B: wait at their desks or something yeah but well -cause 

217.47 218.39 A: huh 

219.49 221.43 A: well we lived in oklahoma city 

221.49 222.06 B: right 

221.95 224.42 A: when they had that you know that bomb there and 

224.14 225.01 B: oh yeah 

228.05 231.00 A: didn't actually know anyone but you know that would have been another one 

231.11 233.10 A: to go back and you know have people 

234.06 235.82 A: not gone to work that day or 

236.14 237.02 B: yeah 

237.01 238.33 A: oh 

237.17 244.39 B: yeah i mean i think from a personal standpoint i could definitely see the september eleventh because one of uh 

245.58 248.71 B: one of my pretty a close a pretty close friend of mine 

249.28 250.16 B: uh 

250.85 251.61 B: was 

251.73 253.02 B: at you know he he 

253.34 254.83 B: he was on the 

254.35 255.63 A: i'm sorry 

255.97 258.98 B: i said a pretty close friend of mine was on the ninety something floor 

259.06 259.56 A: great 

259.49 263.93 B: and he didn't make it i think he probably actually died on impact but um 
263.25 263.91 A: yeah 

265.35 270.06 B: is it you know it is actually a really disappointing uh you know it was his second day of work 

270.51 271.02 A: ach 

270.99 272.48 B: so it like it was on a 

273.22 274.51 B: tuesday i think 

275.25 278.68 B: and his first day was the day before it was a monday 

279.07 280.63 A: yeah i think you are right 

280.16 280.66 B: yeah 

280.99 281.37 B: and 

281.11 283.04 A: wow 

281.64 283.17 B: so he had just started it as 

283.70 285.06 B: you know like a brand new job 

285.55 289.68 B: and that is probably the only reason why he was there and like you know 

289.96 294.07 B: and they are you know so early as well right because you know um they first 

294.85 297.09 B: week or so that you are on the job you 

296.03 297.79 A: yeah really you are never late yeah 

297.88 298.69 B: yeah you would always 

298.01 301.26 A: yeah might slack off later 

299.64 310.67 B: yeah exactly you know what i mean -cause uh you know living in new york is interesting but you'll talk to a lot of people and they'll just say you know oh i just happen to be running late that day 

311.33 318.55 B: you know or and i was coming out of the subway or you know like i know so many more people who had these stories of like well i 

311.36 321.52 A: wow i should have been there 

325.66 326.09 B: friends who 

326.48 328.28 B: just happen to be there because of his 

329.06 335.59 B: you know like his second day of work and you can't really you know you don't you don't want to be late for that kind of thing so 

329.13 330.50 A: right 

334.14 334.59 A: right 

335.70 340.67 A: yeah i kind of thought about the uh oklahoma city thing that way too i had a baby that was um 

341.27 343.27 A: at that time was like three weeks old 

343.58 344.99 A: and um 

345.42 346.50 A: you you have to get (( social )) 

346.84 348.53 A: social security card first 

348.66 351.03 A: kids now before you can do your taxes and so 

349.14 349.65 B: uh-huh 

351.45 354.45 A: you know i could have packed up all my kids and 

355.15 360.50 A: you know gone down there to get her social security card that day i mean we could have been there and that you know 

357.90 358.47 B: or 

361.17 362.28 B: yeah it is crazy 

361.73 362.30 A: so 

362.46 363.04 A: ach 

363.18 364.41 A: yuck so i guess 

365.25 366.28 A: i guess uh 

366.40 373.57 A: summarize our decision we would we would you know somehow avoid catastrophes now so 

372.24 374.66 B: yeah i think so something like that 

373.78 374.67 A: wow 

375.62 376.15 A: wow 

376.98 378.10 A: so huh 

378.46 379.74 A: interesting 

380.50 381.67 A: ach that sounded good 

381.91 382.87 B: yeah i know i'm 

382.54 383.40 A: um 

383.75 390.51 A: well you said you are in new york i live in northern idaho yeah 

386.96 388.29 B: idaho really
