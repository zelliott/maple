13.46 14.92 B: [laughter] 

15.76 20.33 A: [mn] i guess we're supposed to discuss this topic did you get what it is 

20.16 21.88 B: the school system 

21.44 25.51 A: yeah there's something seriously wrong in the u._s. public school system 

25.25 26.91 B: well do you think there is [mn] 

26.64 29.35 A: oh i think there is definitely in my area 

29.35 30.72 B: where are you from 

30.39 32.01 A: ah west virginia 

31.72 35.43 B: west virginia i'm in north carolina so we're not that far apart 

34.90 37.24 A: [laughter] no we're not 

38.25 40.81 B: well what do you think is wrong with our school system 

40.28 45.27 A: [mn] um [mn] i guess i don't believe that there is enough ah 

45.38 55.88 A: information for the students to choose from i think i i'm a christian so i'm you know definitely against a lot of the things that they are taking out of school saying 

56.01 58.87 A: that it would be with church and state you know 

58.58 60.49 B: yeah i agree with that 

60.41 64.64 A: yeah i mean they say that there are a lot of people that are 

65.05 76.19 A: christians and this is you know supposed to be a christian nation [mn] but they aren't showing that by giving the option for the students to choose they're saying no you can't have any at all 

76.10 77.11 B: right 

76.51 82.52 A: and i think i'm i'm sorry but i believe that's one of the problems we have with morals and standards in our school 

83.03 88.89 A: i believe that it's not an option it is um pushed on the students 

89.37 91.97 B: yeah and also taken away 

92.02 92.93 A: yes 

93.85 95.12 B: (( i agree with that )) 

95.11 95.94 A: yeah 

96.00 105.00 B: i also believe we have financial problems with our school systems [mn] um my daughter is in the eleventh grade and 

104.44 106.21 A: oh my son is too 

105.78 107.01 B: oh really [mn] 

106.30 107.58 A: mhm 

107.30 112.61 B: [mn] and she came home this year and said that she had to take a test 

113.12 115.63 B: and the test cost twenty dollars 

116.04 123.35 B: and i said well what is the test for and she said well it's a test that everyone has to take 

123.50 129.45 B: well they ended up giving their money back to the to all the students that had to take this test 

129.01 130.48 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm [mn] )) 

129.34 142.42 B: but the reason for it costing to start with was because the school system didn't have the [mn] money or the f- well the funds to print this test out on paper 

143.06 146.23 B: so it was for the ink for their printers [laughter] and 

145.66 147.68 A: oh give me a break 

147.09 149.43 B: i was really upset [mn] 

149.13 151.44 A: [laughter] to say the least 

151.12 162.61 B: [mn] so i had to call the school and voice my opinion of course i'm sure it didn't do any good mine didn't but they did get their money back all the students did so i just felt that was really wrong 

159.67 160.76 A: yeah 

164.00 168.30 A: well i i um i work at a private school i work at a christian school 

167.87 169.12 B: (( oh do you ))

197.80 198.73 A: so 

199.45 208.50 A: [mn] i don't attend the p._t._a. i can't say i get involved with that because i'm involved with the christian school but we have tried our community has tried to upgrade the system 

208.79 210.17 A: you know here
