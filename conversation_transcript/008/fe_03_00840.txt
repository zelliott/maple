220.72 221.03 A: but 

221.17 222.84 A: well let me ask you a question 

224.75 225.23 B: well i 

225.53 227.72 B: i suppose you can weigh the pros and cons i mean 

228.05 231.10 B: the obvious pros are a million dollars i mean what would you do with a million dollars 

231.60 235.88 A: (( )) was it is it taxed is it under the table 

235.42 242.48 B: we'll say it's a million dollars after tax because they didn't specify did you here that guys researchers go ahead and specify next time 

241.82 244.96 A: huh so your saying it's taxed 

245.48 246.18 B: huh no 

245.50 247.77 A: i don't either way i wouldn't do it either way 

246.52 247.24 B: no it's after 

247.50 250.42 B: let's do it after taxes no i know you wouldn't do it but 

251.29 255.98 B: huh if you did your just weighing the pros and cons if you did what would you spend there million dollars on 

253.25 253.82 A: oh okay 

256.33 256.84 A: oh 

257.09 257.55 A: huh 

257.74 258.26 A: god 

258.71 261.06 A: pay off my student loans 

260.37 261.34 B: oh you have student loans 

261.93 262.25 A: yea 

262.34 262.98 B: how much you have 

263.18 263.75 A: oh 

263.91 264.68 A: too much 

264.72 265.24 B: oh really 

265.20 265.76 A: like it 

266.12 266.49 A: huh 

266.69 271.00 B: see i was lucky i had an unanonymous benefactor in the form of my uncle who paid for 

270.38 270.79 A: oh 

271.14 272.84 B: thirty five percent of my college i think 

272.85 273.83 A: oh how wonderful 

273.77 274.38 B: now it was 

274.71 276.19 B: pretty handy 

275.87 276.63 A: that's great 

277.23 279.23 B: yeah i didn't want to have to take out loans cause 

280.08 281.38 B: my friends have loans and they just 

281.70 283.66 B: paying off on them forever you know 

283.27 287.97 A: right and my fiance graduated medical school 

288.20 288.70 A: he has 

288.96 289.71 A: tremendous luck 

289.86 293.10 A: so i would pay off both of our student loans so 

292.85 294.29 B: and that would be like what ten bucks 

294.58 296.78 A: oh yea it's probably like 

296.90 298.62 A: you know three hundred thousand dollars 

299.55 300.07 B: huh 

300.21 301.88 B: so is that all what else did you get 

302.16 307.36 A: i don't know i'd probably don't some some money to some charities that have meaning to me 

308.02 308.87 A: and huh 

309.23 310.66 A: i'd buy a nice house 

311.56 315.86 B: yes a nice house that would be one of the first things i'd do and i would donate some too 

316.62 319.73 B: huh hum i'm trying to think honestly how much i would donate 

320.41 321.44 B: like in the percentage 

321.99 323.85 B: of that at least ten percent 

324.78 328.14 B: hum but i don't know how much would you donate like if you did take the money 

328.51 328.98 A: hum 

329.18 333.05 A: i think ten percent i don't know if that comes from like your 

333.16 336.50 A: give ten percent of everything blah blah blah but uh 

336.96 338.42 A: yea i think ten percent is good 

339.84 345.75 A: and i you know you could also like you know volunteer your time so you can say okay i'll give you ten percent and volunteer my time so 

345.63 346.49 B: yea really time is 

347.15 348.72 B: a lot of ways time is more important 

348.86 349.50 B: money any way 

349.59 352.00 A: right cause any one can give money which again you know you can just 

352.13 359.44 A: it's hollow i guess money is hollow it gives you it gives you the a opportunity to give you a lot of things and experience a lot of things but 

360.64 361.15 A: fleeting 

361.99 363.20 B: yea it's not as important as 

363.77 364.12 A: right 

365.10 365.46 A: right 

365.75 368.21 A: well i'm sure that your friend would be happy to know that you wouldn't 

369.19 373.10 B: i don't know i'm sure you friend would be to i'm sure they'd be like wow 

373.79 380.24 A: so like no but see if it really happened my best friend she would say but now if that really happened 

379.96 380.58 B: oh yea 

381.01 384.23 B: if if my best friend to would be like you should be taking that money 

383.95 388.15 A: cause like why your stupid if you don't take the money 

387.65 390.23 B: they'd be like okay take the money 

390.54 401.84 B: and since no rule has specified again researchers that you can't give them so be like take the money give me half of it and then write letters i._m. me email me things like that 

396.52 398.55 A: we'll be like 

401.16 405.95 A: there you go never have to see me but we can talk right 

405.72 408.72 B: didn't wasn't it huh oh this is going to fool around and mess with me again wasn't it 

409.06 411.45 B: you can't speak to your friend isn't that what they said 

411.37 414.76 A: huh i thought it said you could never see your friend ever again 

414.07 414.72 B: is that what they said 

415.27 415.60 B: was it 

415.29 416.38 A: i i don't remember 

416.86 417.28 A: hum 

417.74 419.83 A: or or if that's the case if you couldn't 

419.97 422.29 A: speak to you friend ever again you could hum 

422.68 423.48 A: sign language 

423.61 425.40 B: yea you could do a lot of things yea 

423.71 423.99 A: right 

425.35 428.55 A: just kind of hang out and watch football or what ever 

427.42 427.92 B: mm 

428.13 430.02 B: alternative means of communication 

430.15 431.21 A: there you go so the 

431.53 434.72 B: even if it was see or speak you could still find a way to communicate 

434.90 435.85 A: right if they said 

435.98 437.58 A: cease all communication 

437.83 438.55 A: with your 

439.04 440.78 A: best friend that would make it even 

441.42 442.23 A: well you can
