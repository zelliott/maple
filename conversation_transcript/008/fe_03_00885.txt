20.44 23.71 A: sure i watch survivor occasionally 

24.17 31.33 A: um and i do watch the who wants to marry a millionaire show [mn] i guess the reason why is because [lipsmack] 

31.98 34.46 A: you never know what the outcome is going to be 

35.53 46.21 B: okay [mn] i um never watch survivor ah with some of the other ones like the bachelor bachelorette i only tuned in to the last show just because 

46.39 53.21 B: i wanted to be able to converse with everyone [laughter] the next day at work because everyone else watched them um 

48.63 49.77 A: [laughter] 

53.25 54.43 B: (( i )) 

54.55 67.46 B: don't enjoy shows like that my sister loves it as a matter of fact my daughter goes over every thursday night and they both watch that survivor but i just i don't know too busy doing other stuff that

71.48 73.00 B: mhm 

72.27 75.13 A: then you have to watch it week to week 

74.58 76.06 B: mhm 

75.41 80.21 A: to know what's going on and one reason why i like to watch survivor is to see the country 

79.75 80.88 B: mhm 

80.30 86.93 A: you know the settings where they're putting them and you know the environment and everything that's you know one of the reasons that i guess 

82.29 83.44 B: (( yes )) 

86.97 92.04 A: the other shows i don't have to sit there and really concentrate on them either 

90.40 91.56 B: mhm

125.69 127.21 B: mhm [mn] 

126.47 128.26 A: i mean i just [laughter]

131.18 132.32 A: yeah 

131.68 136.29 B: um and there was another one that was supposed to start um 

136.62 139.39 B: where america picks who gets married 

137.98 138.54 A: (( [mn] )) 

138.76 144.75 A: yeah yeah and i'm not impressed with that either because i don't like the whole philosophy of that one 

139.67 140.51 B: (( is it )) 

144.35 148.28 B: mhm [lipsmack] well that was like with who wants to marry a millionaire 

148.43 149.61 A: oh true 

149.22 154.14 B: you know that was k- but that i think was one of the first reality shows that were on 

154.05 156.46 A: yeah and look what happened in the end 

155.88 157.65 B: right right 

156.59 158.12 A: everything bombed 

157.75 158.78 B: right 

158.57 163.97 A: and most of them have 'cause i was reading in one of the magazines that most of them have bombed out 

163.44 170.11 B: right um what's that one that aaron the banker bachelor who wants to marry a or the 

170.24 173.28 B: bachelor him and her aren't even together 

172.75 174.61 A: (( no no they're not )) 

174.04 176.81 B: and ah neither is that um 

176.98 178.79 B: who wants to marry a millionaire 

179.02 181.60 A: no but i didn't think they would 

182.24 185.03 A: they didn't look like they were gonna get together anyway 

185.48 189.04 A: 'cause they were both she was too standoffish to me 

188.91 193.44 B: yeah well what what did he even pick her for i mean that didn't even make sense why would he 

192.83 196.74 A: 'cause i think she was more [mn] down to earth than the other girls were 

196.42 197.68 B: (( oh )) 

197.72 198.78 A: and i think 

197.85 201.13 B: well i guess he had a different criteria he was looking for 

200.94 203.83 A: [mn] i think he was looking for somebody with his 

204.32 205.54 A: status 

206.33 207.65 B: oh okay 

207.50 211.03 A: not somebody that wanted him for his money 

211.60 213.83 B: oh okay that was her 

213.46 214.64 A: yeah 

214.05 216.17 B: oh she still came out half a million 

216.01 219.66 A: yeah really i'd have done it for that [laughter] 

217.01 218.10 B: [laughter] 

218.97 226.91 B: yeah really i mean you know you go away someone's waiting on you hand and foot [mn] and after six weeks or whatever it is you get half a million dollars 

226.61 227.98 A: i can handle that 

227.59 231.02 B: right that's what [laughter] i think that's why they have 

228.69 229.50 A: (( i mean )) 

231.20 237.26 B: they don't um they don't need to go looking for contestants because most people 

237.43 241.70 B: you know for that kind of money or even the the thought of that [lipsmack] 

239.24 243.51 A: mhm yeah but that was a surprise ending and nobody knew that 

243.08 245.40 B: yeah well that's true that's something

463.00 464.06 A: oh really 

463.53 466.65 B: yes [mn] only 'cause it's in inner city 

464.15 465.62 A: [mn] well she was in a

475.63 486.18 B: but yes they um they do travel it's a good probably hour for most people mhm i c- you know if i have to drive more than fifteen minutes for work then forget it i don't work there 

479.83 480.85 A: really 

481.31 482.65 A: wow 

486.88 488.25 A: me too no 

487.48 497.07 B: [laughter] i don't like to drive all that much so i [mn] you know for me it is only about fifteen twenty minutes into allegheny so it's not bad at all for me 

488.95 489.88 A: [laughter] 

495.88 497.93 A: oh that's no mhm 

497.25 500.97 B: i can't even imagine these people that drive that far i it 

500.20 501.83 A: no i can't either well 

501.02 508.26 B: seems too hard well i guess you almost though i guess down there you almost have to jump but you have all those interstates to jump on 

507.43 511.51 A: yeah well that's what i was going to say my husband works twenty six miles away 

511.19 512.33 B: mhm 

511.60 515.65 A: a- and he has to drive on the interstate every day 

515.34 516.93 B: right right 

515.87 518.16 A: and it's like you know forty five minutes 

518.53 519.53 B: right 

518.64 523.37 A: so i mean it's ridiculous but oh well you know you go where your job is too 

520.28 521.17 B: (( right [mn] )) 

522.59 524.92 B: right right absolutely 

523.50 527.59 A: so you know if your j- your job moves and you know you have to move also 

527.03 532.99 B: mhm mhm [lipsmack] well it was nice talking with you and we kind of veered off 

527.92 528.87 A: so 

531.12 532.45 A: well i think they 

532.57 536.50 A: they tell us when our ten minutes are up yeah [laughter] 

534.03 541.10 B: oh do they see i've never okay 'cause i was kinda like this was [mn] this is my second call but 

540.14 541.46 A: is it really 

541.14 542.23 B: (( yes )) 

542.08 544.43 A: they must be having trouble getting people 

544.32 545.32 B: why 

544.80 546.46 A: i don't know because they called 

546.59 549.56 A: [mn] i had my daughter's baby yesterday 

549.73 554.65 A: and they kept calling and calling and i knew i couldn't take ten minutes out of my sched- you know 

554.38 555.42 B: (( ahah )) 

554.94 559.13 A: and they kept calling and calling and calling and calling and calling 

559.15 561.76 A: [lipsmack] they must have called five times yesterday 

561.10 574.64 B: well you know what they have been calling me for two weeks they have called me five ten times a day as a matter of fact my husband said what the heck and and meanwhile i forgot all about it i must have [mn] signed up a while ago and just huh 

566.79 567.97 A: yeah 

574.35 586.79 A: see i didn't sign up until like a week ago and they called me yesterday to verify and then they called me again today i mean you know then those calls started yesterday so that's why i was wondering if they're having and i'm hoping i hate to be rude but hoping this is legitimate 

580.29 581.27 B: yeah 

587.36 591.38 B: well i think it is i'll tell you why i went on their website 

591.49 592.45 A: did you 

592.06 595.47 B: yes and it is through the like it has ah 

595.60 599.95 B: university of pittsburgh and it ha- i think it's a g. o. v. or something 

597.38 598.42 A: okay
