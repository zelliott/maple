14.64 17.14 A: if i could change something about 

17.23 20.20 A: what happened to you in the past what would you do um 

20.71 22.44 B: is this something directly that 

22.70 25.17 B: we did or something that could've happened to us 

23.91 24.85 A: i think 

25.47 26.08 A: well 

26.57 28.23 A: i don't think it matters i think it 

28.43 29.86 A: any specifics (( about )) 

29.97 34.03 A: that just something that happened to you or that you did or 

30.79 31.29 B: hm 

35.20 37.25 A: hm yeah i know this is a tough (( -ey )) 

35.21 36.27 B: hm 

37.95 39.44 A: what would you change 

38.99 41.11 B: see if i could go back uh i think i'd 

41.22 41.64 B: i'd 

43.21 44.23 B: i wouldn't change 

44.83 47.48 B: anything really about myself i think i would change 

48.15 49.34 B: my parents 

49.13 52.88 A: would they be nicer 

51.04 52.08 B: i had uh 

52.57 61.90 B: i just you know what i had a horrible horrible childhood i had a an abusive father so i mean if that's something i could change i would do that 

55.39 56.46 A: oh my gosh 

60.07 62.69 A: oh my gosh oh my gosh 

62.07 64.25 B: but um otherwise i 

64.92 68.36 B: i i pretty much live my life where there's nothing that 

69.11 73.20 A: i can't the only thing i would probably have not worked as hard when i was working 

69.48 70.50 B: i think i'd really 

73.51 74.09 B: hm 

74.12 78.54 A: but it wasn't worth it yes i do so i'm not working now though 

75.43 76.49 B: do you have children 

77.00 78.56 B: yeah oh 

78.65 79.24 B: yeah 

79.41 80.27 B: neither am i 

80.87 81.76 A: which is 

81.22 84.15 B: so i'm trying to make some money with these 

81.87 85.32 A: which is a nice thing yeah that ten dollars is really going to come in handy 

84.48 92.13 B: i know i keep telling my husband that oh yeah but you see i am doing something you'll see when those checks come rolling in (( i mean )) 

90.49 94.21 A: yeah that ten dollars ought to really make a dent in the bank account 

94.02 96.12 B: it's pizza night the way i see it 

96.03 100.95 A: this is true but you can't get anything on it for ten dollars 

97.21 97.68 B: i guess 

98.81 100.29 B: i know i know 

100.46 102.16 B: i i think um 

103.43 107.31 B: i guess if i was to change something else it would probably be the way um 

108.35 110.07 B: i handled the breaking up with a 

110.43 112.35 B: a boy when i was young -er 

112.86 114.38 B: it was just very immature 

114.60 115.06 A: mean 

115.85 120.19 B: ah i broke his heart i wasn't i wasn't really mean i was just very aloof 

117.58 118.06 A: hm 

120.75 123.01 B: because i because of my childhood i 

123.26 128.08 B: i found it very difficult to get close to anyone so when i felt that somebody 

128.18 131.62 B: was getting to close to me then i put my guard up and i shut them out 

131.69 133.69 A: yeah that's a pretty freudian 

131.72 132.21 B: so 

134.53 135.26 B: yeah 

135.22 137.20 A: you know explanation for 

136.89 137.52 B: yeah 

137.74 141.54 A: growing up and that this is a tough one i don't know 

142.51 145.56 A: i probably wouldn't have been so mean to teachers and 

146.37 154.62 A: probably would've done better in school and paid more attention and not treated it as if who cares 

154.46 162.09 B: oh well you know what you you just gave me a thought if i could go back in time i would i would have definitely gone to college 

162.38 164.76 A: oh i did that i didn't have a choice 

163.32 164.04 B: but it was 

164.46 171.28 B: yes see i it was never brought up to me it was never something that was ever talked about and and i had um 

171.64 180.00 B: lived out west in arizona in a very small town and my family moved around a lot and and so when we have moved back to the east coast 

179.98 180.95 A: was that military 

181.32 188.11 B: um no it was just my father was in law enforcement and so when we have moved back to the east coast 

181.83 182.29 A: okay 

183.95 184.50 A: okay 

188.29 188.83 B: the 

189.46 191.99 B: a- academic wise it was so uh 

191.05 191.74 A: mhm 

192.17 196.81 B: so much more strict that when i got back in to high school in the east coast 

196.99 200.30 A: oh you moved in high school ew yuck that's traumatic 

198.46 201.98 B: oh i i moved almost like every year it was ew 

202.15 205.22 B: i'd change everything in my past um 

204.98 205.91 A: where do you live now 

205.97 207.17 B: i live in new jersey 

207.15 207.87 A: oh where 

208.03 209.49 B: uh in parssipany 

209.50 210.05 A: oh 

210.36 211.04 B: where are you 

211.07 212.28 A: lancaster pennsylvania 

212.34 215.82 B: oh okay okay yeah i know where that is 

215.99 217.59 B: i'm sorry 

216.18 218.52 A: not i i don't really fit there either 

217.82 228.69 B: no i don't really fit here in new jersey but i was i was born here and then i moved all over and when my family moved back i met my husband when i was seventeen and that was it 

228.18 229.05 A: wow 

228.98 230.52 B: so yeah 

230.07 231.80 A: you've been married since you were seventeen 

231.92 233.94 B: no i got married when i was twenty 

234.52 237.37 B: and my husband is eleven years older than me so 

234.77 235.08 A: okay 

237.13 238.00 A: wow 

237.73 239.80 B: yeah doesn't that sound awful 

239.80 243.94 A: n- not doesn't sound awful it's uh surprising that you are still married 
242.01 243.54 B: well i'll tell you i 

243.75 250.80 B: i have a thirteen year old son and when he is seventeen if he meets anybody that's twenty eight 

245.82 247.36 A: oh my god 

251.16 251.87 B: he's dead 

252.07 253.09 A: oh absolutely 

252.11 261.77 B: that's it that's it but i really lucked out my husband is he's a great guy great guy i'm really blessed with my family but i think that um 

253.19 254.17 A: absolutely 

262.23 268.97 B: if i could've done anything i i because i did do very well in school and i graduated high school two years early 

268.49 270.73 A: oh my gosh and you didn't go to college 

269.44 269.88 B: and 

270.65 271.42 B: no 

271.57 275.45 B: no it was just so i was so naive and and uh 

275.05 278.81 A: my husband didn't either and he he blames his parents 

278.95 279.76 A: um 

279.88 287.52 A: and it he regrets it and he is actually going back now but you know taking one class at a time and he'll be a hundred before he gets a degree 

285.31 285.88 B: yeah 

288.56 295.90 A: but it's interesting though because you know now i have to remember what kind of influence you have on your children's life 

294.52 302.66 B: uh yeah it's really something to think about i mean i even i even talk to my kids about it now because it's something um 

296.93 297.88 A: it's scary 

302.96 311.72 B: where i had considered to going back to school in september but i had some health problems so i've had to put it off but i i want to be uh a registered nurse 

311.17 311.83 A: oh 

311.82 312.29 B: so 

312.51 315.67 B: um my my kids know this and i have some some textbooks 

315.77 319.10 B: from some of my girlfriends that are going through the program and 

318.68 320.31 A: are you going to do it like through a hospital 

320.87 328.51 B: um i'm going to go through my county college first for the two years and then i'm going to go through the local hospital um 

323.59 324.12 A: okay 

327.21 327.66 A: okay 

328.96 330.96 B: so it's it's been really 

331.17 331.77 B: even though 

331.89 332.59 B: i haven't 

332.88 336.71 B: started yet but just the fact that my kids know 

337.10 348.11 B: oh mom is going to go to school mom is going to get homework too and and they know that i want to better my life and make a difference and that kind of stuff so i think it's had an effect on them 

348.29 350.15 B: we'll see they are still so young 

348.33 354.19 A: yup i keep threatening my kids with what do you you know you want a minimum wage job for the rest of your life 

353.38 356.35 B: my 

355.77 357.61 A: my parents gave me no choice 

357.86 358.43 B: yeah 

357.93 361.90 A: i i mean i was going to college when i was in elementary school 

363.07 367.85 A: i mean because they both did which was highly unusual for my parents were in their eighties so 

368.04 368.54 B: hm 

368.71 371.40 A: you know it wasn't the normal thing back then 

371.46 372.05 B: yeah 

371.59 372.68 A: for uh and 

373.30 373.66 B: (( yeah )) 

373.30 378.19 A: you know it was weird i just i didn't know i had a choice whether to go to school or not i was going 

378.35 378.97 B: wow 

379.12 379.77 A: so 

379.46 381.94 B: and see i was on the o- opposite end because 

381.60 382.15 A: ach 

382.08 384.26 B: that was just nothing that was ever 

384.77 386.41 B: my my choice was 

386.86 388.12 B: when you got out of school 

386.89 387.97 A: get a job 

388.26 389.50 B: yeah you get a job 

389.82 391.27 B: so when i was fifteen 

391.68 392.49 B: i had a job 

392.86 393.87 A: isn't that disgusting 

393.96 394.97 B: so yeah 

395.16 397.56 A: and then you just work and work and work and work for 

402.20 407.45 B: um one of the lead prosecutors were leaving so i was a um 

407.62 411.08 B: manager at his law firm that he started up and that's where i met my husband 

409.73 410.18 A: huh 

411.46 412.37 A: is he a lawyer 

412.00 412.30 B: so 

412.59 418.31 B: no thank goodness he's actually he's actually an electrician 

418.18 418.88 A: okay 

418.73 422.29 B: and uh he was uh the foreman on this new building 

422.90 423.55 B: so and that's 

423.66 424.78 B: that's where i met him 

424.86 425.83 A: oh my goodness 

425.71 426.34 B: yeah 

426.47 426.90 B: so 

427.56 429.57 B: but i think that that was probably 

430.40 437.33 B: i would say one of my biggest regrets if i can go back and change anything i think i would have liked to have gone to college before i had kids 

437.32 437.88 A: yeah 

438.12 439.33 A: and i i've 

439.79 445.06 A: did the college thing and i did the work thing and i didn't get married -til i was thirty 

445.36 445.75 A: four 

445.97 446.48 B: hm 

445.99 446.74 A: thirty three 

446.78 447.34 B: mhm 

447.63 448.17 A: so 

448.49 449.32 A: i kind of 

449.51 451.32 A: did it the opposite way 

451.07 451.62 B: yeah 

451.83 456.07 A: sometimes i wish maybe i should of gotten had children a little earlier 

456.11 462.39 B: yeah i think you know everybody kind of thinks well would of could of should of you know and hear other people 

457.06 457.56 A: but 

460.63 461.14 A: right 

462.54 463.32 A: right 

462.59 462.95 B: right 

463.15 467.13 B: you know it's kind of like if you have curly hair you want straight hair you know 

465.85 473.31 A: absolutely so but if you could go back in time and change something i mean there's probably plenty of things if you 

467.47 467.81 B: so 

473.47 477.02 A: yeah i'm sure i was not nice to everybody in my past either 

477.76 479.90 B: there must be a method to this question 

479.77 485.56 A: yes i know it's very it was funny -cause i remember there was a movie with glen (( )) i think 

480.02 480.64 B: you know 

485.73 488.89 A: about somebody dying and going to heaven 

489.14 490.05 A: did you eh 

490.71 493.01 B: i i vaguely remember that 

490.73 491.33 A: and 

492.46 495.12 A: and it was uh one she ended up 

495.32 496.29 A: at a uh 

496.63 501.26 A: ritz carlton and whoever the guy was i can't remember ended up at a motel six 

502.11 508.31 A: it was hysterical they they played your life back of the videotape of your entire life 

503.85 504.56 B: (( )) 

506.11 506.89 B: yeah 

508.87 510.07 B: oh my goodness 

515.49 521.31 A: at the playground and you know he was getting kicked out of school and she she just did everything right
