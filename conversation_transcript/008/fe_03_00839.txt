5.65 7.37 B: kind of an interesting question huh 

7.60 8.45 A: yeah it is 

8.50 11.55 B: i don't know it depends how much you consider a best friend 

12.22 14.73 A: um or how much you consider a million dollars 

14.98 16.92 A: is (( )) i guess so 

17.07 18.25 A: balancing the two 

18.13 20.66 B: to never speak to your best friend again 

21.18 26.69 A: right and i guess it would be interesting too you know if a million dollars wouldn't do it how much money would 

27.15 28.29 A: make it worthwhile 

29.22 31.07 B: well a million bucks i mean 

31.24 32.72 B: for me i could retire 

32.94 34.66 B: and live happily ever after 

34.75 35.18 A: right 

35.03 36.98 B: i could have my forty foot viking 

37.32 39.62 B: i could have my geo metro and the intercoastal 

40.08 40.95 B: and i could like 

41.04 41.41 B: you know 

42.05 42.97 B: do what i wanted to do 

44.05 44.54 A: hm 

44.18 45.06 B: uh 

45.57 46.12 B: let's see 

46.53 46.87 B: hm 

48.37 49.80 B: my my problem is 

50.50 52.76 B: and i think as i speak to a lot of men 

53.72 55.87 B: in this in you know a lot of my friends 

56.03 61.21 B: they don't really consider my best friends really don't consider me my best friends you know what i mean 

61.46 61.87 A: right 

61.51 63.82 B: so do i really have a best friend 

64.04 64.59 A: hm mhm 

71.80 72.22 A: right 

73.12 78.44 B: you know i think that i could easily say you know i really don't have to talk to you anymore for a million dollars 

79.16 83.28 B: but you know now how am i going to keep them from bugging me once he finds out that i have a million bucks 

84.31 88.38 A: yeah or what if it were a family member that you considered your best friend 

88.10 88.96 B: i don't cons- 

88.64 90.92 A: or that you know it wasn't up to you to decide 

91.24 93.12 A: who your best friend was but it was like 

91.84 92.98 B: you're be- 

93.27 94.09 B: you're being 

93.28 94.19 A: oh side four 

94.24 95.50 B: now you're being tough 

95.65 96.23 B: that means 

95.71 97.39 A: yeah though that makes it difficult 

97.44 100.36 B: that means i probably couldn't speak to my wife again right 

100.32 101.48 A: yeah exactly 

101.46 103.19 B: so we live in the same house and like 

103.31 103.91 B: nod 

106.27 111.19 A: yeah and uh it really doesn't you know make any stipulation a- if you can 

111.78 116.20 A: if you actually tell your wife what the reason is or ev- before you start so 

117.18 119.07 A: yeah it could be a messy situation 

117.25 117.75 B: yeah 

119.16 120.59 B: yeah could be could be tough 

120.75 121.24 A: yeah 

121.88 123.65 A: i don't know i think uh 

123.47 124.24 B: million bucks 

124.17 126.29 A: a million dollars is probably not 

127.05 130.66 A: good enough i don't think it would have to be something where you could 

131.22 135.52 A: um have enough money to counteract the effect of the damage you could do 

135.91 136.38 B: well 

135.94 137.90 A: by not speaking to your best friend 

138.09 138.54 B: yeah 

138.80 139.64 A: um 

139.78 142.16 A: and there probably is an amount 

142.23 142.87 B: well they didn't 

142.41 144.76 A: there is probably an amount where that becomes 

145.52 147.58 A: acceptable i just don't know what it is 

147.94 150.28 B: well you've added a lot of speculation into it 

150.79 153.90 B: i if you're going if you're going well if you're going to talk about that 

154.60 155.10 A: yeah 

155.42 157.36 B: to me a million dollars isn't worth 

157.95 159.78 B: not speaking to a family member 

159.98 160.36 A: right 

160.38 161.01 B: ever again 

161.52 162.66 B: if if it if 

161.72 163.51 A: yeah and i don't know if any sum is 

163.24 165.41 B: if the border absolutely 

165.63 167.71 B: absolutely if the borderline 

168.08 170.72 B: were the line in the sand were to be drawn between 

171.13 172.34 B: a best friend that 

172.55 173.97 B: i might have say 

175.14 177.97 B: i'm influenced by the gallup poll a lot 

178.12 180.81 B: gallup does a survey along industry lines where they 

181.23 183.90 B: they they come in and they ask twelve questions and 

184.23 185.53 B: of these twelve questions 

186.94 193.84 B: eh- they determine your point of view and your attitude towards the corporation you work for and one of the questions is do you have a best friend at work 

196.15 196.85 B: and 

197.03 200.63 B: if it would be a a line in the sand between 

200.93 204.00 B: having a best friend at work and a best friend away from work 

206.05 211.10 B: i would say you know i don't have to talk to you again for a million bucks because 

209.14 210.02 A: right 

211.59 217.81 B: you know when i move away and get the things that i want to have and retire early and enjoy you know what i mean 

218.01 218.54 A: hm mhm 

219.36 222.37 B: that scenario uh i could do that easily 

222.72 223.39 B: because 

222.75 223.10 A: right 

223.67 224.32 B: per se 

224.76 227.42 B: i have some very good friends that i care about a lot 

228.07 228.55 B: but 

230.28 231.41 B: i could overcome that 

231.58 232.36 B: for a million bucks 

232.85 236.92 A: right and you have to think also what would really be damaged in that situation i mean 

239.30 242.17 A: i don't know i mean you'd you would be hurting the person i'm sure 

242.66 252.16 A: but i'm sure that you could also think of it like their hurt would turn to anger towards you and and that would sort of absolve you after a while you wouldn't feel guilty about it anymore 

244.70 245.90 B: i don't 

247.91 248.36 B: i 

252.90 253.47 B: from a ops- 

253.68 254.68 B: effects point of view 

255.14 257.20 B: i'd i'd you know i know 

257.80 259.07 B: in observation 

259.88 260.30 B: that 

261.81 262.59 B: uh the 

263.16 265.39 B: the feminine gender has more 

267.80 269.43 B: compassion towards friendship 

269.58 270.51 B: i think than what 

270.80 271.94 B: the male gender has 

272.80 275.52 B: in my perspective and and maybe i'm (( )) 

275.71 277.16 B: (( )) but it just seems 

277.34 278.16 B: to me like uh 

279.07 279.83 B: uh 

281.66 282.15 B: i don't know 

282.42 283.40 B: i i it uh 

283.54 286.30 B: i observe it that that women have more 

286.42 291.57 B: best friends than what men do now i mean i could be very well wrong but at least from my perspective and how 

292.83 295.27 B: i treat my best friends and how my best friends 

295.46 300.67 B: treat me and how i see my best friends treating other friends who they consider their best friends it's like you know 

301.29 305.14 B: you just another you just another beer out there sitting on the counter 

305.56 309.80 B: you know what i mean and i i can i can change beers it's not that important 

309.25 309.76 A: right 

310.18 311.28 B: so i i don't know 

311.39 313.10 B: i uh that's a tough one 

311.70 312.29 A: yeah 

314.03 314.48 A: yeah 

314.05 314.45 B: fam- 

314.74 316.82 B: family member i couldn't you know 

314.96 315.69 A: cause then 

317.66 321.25 B: i i couldn't and i don't consider i don't consider my family 

322.01 323.09 B: members my best 

323.21 323.67 B: friend 

324.54 327.51 B: as my love as much as my loved ones and 

328.66 330.30 B: somebody that i exist with 

330.86 331.21 A: right 

331.35 333.05 B: but i i guess where you where you draw 

335.46 337.33 A: yeah it it really depends where you 

337.82 339.66 A: how you define what the best friend is 

340.84 343.63 A: um cause i mean i start to think about um 

344.53 346.63 A: a family member thing is really an issue 

347.25 348.13 A: i mean that would be 

349.06 350.26 A: i don't think there's any price 

350.95 353.59 A: but then if you took my best friend outside of my family 

354.53 355.09 A: um 

356.16 357.12 A: oh 

357.43 360.24 A: probably for twenty five million dollars i'd do it 

360.38 362.19 B: twenty five million for a million 

361.44 362.93 A: yeah not for a million 

362.60 367.34 B: honestly for a million i could find another best friend that you know what i mean yeah 

366.28 366.78 A: really 

367.64 368.04 A: yeah 

368.08 369.35 B: you know i've i mean that's 

369.50 371.60 B: kind of been the way things have been for me 

371.91 377.08 B: and i and i have to believe that the maj- the reason why i feel that way in in in doesn't 

378.94 379.31 B: -sarily 

380.41 383.56 B: have a compassion towards friendship as much is because 

384.11 386.15 B: the working relationship the the 

386.43 386.73 B: the 

388.33 389.87 B: my work relationship that i have 

391.08 397.85 B: takes the majority sixty five percent of my time away from my real world so when i'm done having that and i'm finally at home 

398.54 400.71 B: spending the time i have with my family 

401.48 402.89 B: i don't have 

403.18 406.56 B: time to want to go at honestly don't want to go out and have a 

407.01 408.60 B: a friendship with another person 

408.99 409.40 A: right 

409.65 410.29 B: kind of stran- 

410.73 411.44 B: for me so 

411.27 412.43 A: what about um 

412.80 416.46 A: did you were you friends with people when you were younger that you've lost touch with 

416.85 417.51 B: oh yeah 

417.29 418.54 A: i mean did that happen a lot 

419.28 419.84 B: i mean 

419.35 419.87 A: because 

420.06 420.50 B: yeah 

420.14 420.58 A: yeah 

421.10 421.84 B: absolutely 

422.51 423.67 B: you know there's 

422.61 425.03 A: but was the nature of the friendship different than 

425.13 426.65 A: than with the friends you have now 

426.92 432.62 B: yeah because everybody got occupied in their lives and in their direction they focused on their work and their family 

432.96 433.42 A: hm mhm 

433.15 437.63 B: and you know the whole friendship deal became another sideline thing and i think that's why 

437.93 441.08 B: referenced it to just another beer on the counter type thing 

440.85 441.34 A: yeah 

443.02 444.99 B: may may seem very cold 

445.94 446.24 B: but 

446.35 449.11 B: now from another perspective i i watched 

449.66 451.08 B: watch my wife 

452.05 455.43 B: i just watch the dog i we just gave the dog a huge bone 

455.53 457.08 B: like this it's this big flat 

455.73 456.22 A: uh huh 

457.43 460.47 B: have you seen the thing about giving animals cornstarch bones 

460.30 461.26 A: no not at all 

461.01 462.56 B: have you seen that 

462.53 463.20 A: no 

462.66 463.03 B: (( )) 

463.67 464.47 B: it's a big deal 

464.91 466.14 B: so we we have this 

466.46 467.62 B: two and a half pound 

467.99 469.66 B: to i think she might be maybe 

470.52 471.45 B: seven pounds and 

471.91 472.65 B: seven pounds 

473.23 473.56 B: and we

478.61 478.94 B: uh 

479.45 482.29 B: a pound of a bone and she's trying to pick it up (( )) so i'm sorry 

482.53 483.29 B: anyhow so

485.24 487.00 B: when you i oh ye-

492.84 493.19 B: heh 

492.85 493.25 A: hm mhm 

493.33 494.50 B: she dropped it again 

494.72 496.30 A: uh 

495.24 495.71 B: uh 

495.98 499.04 B: you know nance has some friends who she grew up with 

499.55 500.01 A: hm mhm 

499.56 500.18 B: and who 

500.28 501.85 B: she can confide in 

502.70 503.70 B: and who are 

504.01 508.72 B: what i would consider it eh makes me envious to have somebody that she can really talk to the way 

509.04 509.54 A: hm mhm 

513.20 513.63 A: right
