65.92 66.38 B: um 

66.68 67.88 B: money hungry 

67.62 69.76 A: then how did she cope with with the news 

69.86 75.02 B: well um she actually well she kind of said that um she 

75.51 79.51 B: w- was actually happy that he wasn't a millionaire -cause she was having a problem with that 

79.83 80.91 B: which it was never clear 

81.09 81.62 B: why 

81.70 82.19 A: oh 

82.00 82.95 B: what her problem was 

83.38 87.78 B: but um she was really into honesty and the whole time she wasn't really um 

88.41 89.84 B: opening up to him and 

90.45 92.39 B: you know falling for him like the ones seemed to 

91.51 93.26 A: oh so she wasn't a big phony 

92.55 93.37 B: seemed to be yeah 

93.88 97.14 B: but she ended up accepting him for who he was and uh 

97.29 98.81 B: happy he didn't have the money and 

99.25 103.17 B: i guess i don't know if they went off in to the sunset or something but um 

102.57 103.93 A: oh how interesting 

103.94 104.57 B: yeah 

104.60 106.15 A: what a kick i saw um 

106.44 111.39 A: i used to see the ads for a lot of you know where they would be like eating worms and doing all these strange things and i just thought 

112.11 114.07 A: that people were pitiful that they'd 

114.37 115.01 A: do that 

115.21 115.63 A: for 

115.73 117.57 A: god knows what the reward was i've 

117.27 117.72 B: right 

117.69 119.37 A: i wouldn't even care what it was 

119.73 122.71 A: but to me they kind of remind me of night time soap operas or something 

122.88 123.94 B: it reminded you of what 

124.27 126.60 A: with uh only l- like night time soap operas 

126.69 130.06 B: yeah exact- and i i think you know that is exactly what it is 

127.54 127.83 A: like 

130.41 131.00 B: yeah 

131.04 133.65 A: like getting a thrill from somebody else's life and saying 

133.43 135.58 B: exa- exactly 

133.92 135.19 A: god you don't have their prob- 

135.95 138.52 A: yeah it's kind of interesting but there is so many of them now 

139.01 139.45 A: it's like 

139.86 142.09 A: i think the t._v. stations are like sheep 

142.18 143.59 A: i know oh 

142.98 149.74 B: i think there are too many of them too yeah i mean some of them are just not as interesting like the one that's i there is one that 

145.24 145.81 A: yeah 

149.88 154.40 B: says married by america that is the title of it i i've never watched that 

151.79 152.48 A: yeah 

154.47 157.89 A: i saw an ad for it it sounds like it's already started or something 

157.54 158.15 B: yeah 

158.40 158.94 A: that that's 

158.60 161.21 B: that didn't seem interesting to me at all 

160.24 167.36 A: isn't that bizarre i'm always curious like on that other one where i guess people got married on t._v. and if they really do get married and if they actually 

167.73 169.70 A: plan to like try to stay together 

170.10 173.01 B: yeah you know did you watch the one where um 

173.97 176.42 B: it was the very first one of who wants to marry a millionaire 

177.19 177.74 B: and 

177.24 179.38 A: um no i saw the part 

179.61 182.48 A: where they were making up their mind um 

183.04 185.64 A: it was like when they when he finally had to pick one or something 

185.29 185.91 B: yeah 

186.07 188.29 A: and they were all in wedding dresses and 

186.10 186.74 B: exactly 

188.02 189.69 B: yeah exactly 

189.30 192.48 A: is that the one where somebody filed suit or 

192.37 196.12 B: you know i think so i was going to say something went wrong there 

196.60 202.80 B: uh you know i don't know if they actually ended up living together and ended up like kind um of coming out that he wasn't 

203.26 206.79 B: as rich as he sou- make him make himself sound you know sound like 

205.14 206.93 A: oh so he might have lied too 

207.75 209.80 B: so yeah i mean i don't think so i mean 

209.94 214.01 B: seriously i mean i mean when you're talking about marriage you know 

211.56 212.95 A: um uh it's amazing i'm like 

213.14 216.17 A: it's like can you imagine yourself doing that you know 

216.26 217.08 B: god i mean 

216.37 216.80 A: (( )) 

216.90 217.21 A: (( yeah )) 

217.30 217.63 A: (( )) 

217.40 223.26 B: it's already hard enough to you know when you know you already know somebody for many years before you get married let alone just 

223.64 224.60 B: out of nowhere 

224.66 225.64 A: i agree 

225.08 226.94 B: you know a few months is not really 

227.28 231.15 B: you know you are not going to really get to know a person in a few weeks or however long it takes 

229.85 230.47 A: no 

231.23 233.96 A: sometimes it's a few years in to a marriage and you go (( )) 

234.14 235.99 B: yeah exactly 

234.15 235.19 A: yeah 

236.00 238.91 A: so that was they just amaze me that there's people willing to 

236.23 236.74 B: yeah 

239.17 239.56 B: pardon 

239.87 242.22 A: it amazes me that there are people willing to 

242.52 243.44 A: do that unless 

243.59 246.20 A: unless they're thinking like i'm going to get discovered or 

245.98 247.61 B: yeah you know what i think that is what it is 

247.74 248.77 B: that is what it is because 

249.26 250.83 B: i mean they they i mean 

251.03 253.09 B: people watch it people talk about it 

253.79 257.81 B: you know for awhile they are kind of in the lime light it's like their fifteen minutes of fame you know 

258.01 258.80 A: i think you're right 

259.04 260.02 A: that is probably it 

259.17 259.92 B: i really think 

260.14 265.37 B: yeah i really think that they do go on there just because you know mom on going to be on t._v. and they probably do get paid 

260.27 260.52 A: (( )) 

260.77 261.08 A: and 

265.94 266.27 A: yeah 

265.94 268.18 B: some money besides of you know whether they 

268.54 272.95 B: person they will get married to is rich or not but they probably get money on there own 

272.38 277.57 A: i think you're right it's a way to get some money and maybe somebody on another show will see it and say like 

273.55 274.12 B: yeah 

277.75 280.23 A: i i think one of those ones on american idol got 

280.42 281.34 A: in to one of those 

281.66 283.12 A: i mean it's not reality t._v. but 

283.03 283.67 B: yeah 

283.54 285.35 A: ended up in some series or something 

285.38 288.47 B: yeah actually that well yeah that one i've never seen 

289.04 290.54 B: i've never watched american idol 

290.61 292.31 A: i got hooked on the guy that's uh 

292.85 295.63 A: i think it's the one where the guy is so rude there are three people sitting there 

296.60 297.14 A: picking 

297.96 301.01 A: i think they all look so much alike that i mix them all up 

301.85 302.94 B: yeah 

302.57 306.58 A: but now there's one uh what is it i'm a celebrity get me out of here or something 

305.93 307.70 B: oh my gosh yeah 

308.07 310.10 B: yeah i've never seen that one either 

310.36 312.91 B: i i mean i see it it it seems to be on every night 

313.58 317.97 A: that's what i wondered it's the same with the american idol it seems like i'm always flicking past something that says 

314.41 315.08 B: yeah 

317.63 323.76 B: exactly i'm always going i'm always flipping past the one that says i'm a celebrity get me out of here and all the celebrities are really 

324.26 325.69 B: they are not really celebrities 

325.38 329.54 A: no they're not they are a little past their prime celebrities (( )) gods 

326.35 326.90 B: they're 

327.68 328.92 B: yeah it's 

329.30 331.46 B: it's kind of like their last chance to stay in the 

331.32 331.67 A: hm 

331.76 333.82 B: in the spotlight or something 

331.85 332.38 A: i know 

333.33 337.08 A: you think they picked the wrong people for discussing reality t._v. 

335.96 341.76 B: yeah i mean that's another thing i think the people they choose i mean the reason people want to watch these is because 

342.08 347.90 B: they find the people interesting maybe their good looking or whatever but if they use these celebrities who are not really celebrities and people 

348.00 349.78 B: really don't care about them to begin with 

348.19 348.81 A: right 

350.19 351.85 B: who cares you know 

350.83 351.79 A: it's true 

351.96 356.06 B: who cares if they are stuck or an island or whatever so 

352.15 352.55 A: like 

355.75 365.57 A: oh it's funny i know we flashed past it once and my my husband and i are going i know i recognize bruce jenner and the rest is like oh who is that other guy wait a minute doesn't he do that rich and famous show 

366.00 369.62 A: like oh yeah okay that's the way to be a celebrity 

366.60 367.26 B: yeah 

369.68 371.45 B: yeah i think the only one that i 

369.80 370.17 A: yeah 

371.79 375.75 B: saw was when i was passing you know flipping through i saw was the one with 

376.08 376.56 B: um 

377.04 378.08 B: i don't even know who's ex- 

378.30 380.81 B: she is i think she's the ex of i think a couple of people 

378.92 380.15 A: oh the blonde lady 

380.59 383.44 A: rod stewart and uh hamil- george hamilton 

381.53 384.89 B: yes yes yes rod stewart's ex yeah 

384.04 386.72 A: -cause i can remember i saw her once on t._v. and she is married to rod 

386.83 395.36 A: but that's uh hamilton talking about making her own baby food and all these wonderful things of mother hood and then a couple of years later it's like jeeze she is married to someone else 

394.84 395.48 B: yeah 

395.75 398.62 A: oh yeah the life of celebrities 

396.28 396.89 B: yeah 

397.52 399.21 B: she is an ex of a couple of people yeah 

399.33 400.06 A: gosh 

400.42 401.59 B: that's the only one that i saw 

400.53 400.96 A: not 

401.93 402.45 B: really 

402.67 411.26 A: and that's plenty -cause yeah the one i saw she was in it and she was doing something with robin leech and it was such an attractive couple i really wanted to watch it you know bah 

402.69 403.36 B: baby 

412.49 413.90 B: yeah 

413.06 418.21 A: no that's funny i'm wondering what their next reality show will be i'm afraid to find out 

417.86 418.64 B: i know 

419.11 419.89 A: like 

419.66 422.31 B: but i think the these are all based in europe anyways 

422.52 423.31 A: oh are they 

422.75 427.54 B: i think that's where they i think so that's where it originated in england or something some european country 

427.44 428.87 A: oh i didn't realize that 

428.41 429.10 B: yeah 

429.38 430.83 B: and then they just kind of 

431.00 435.50 B: came over and made their way to the united states and now every t._v. station seems to be carrying them 

435.63 439.30 A: yeah that's what really irritates me it's like okay well we'll all do it then 

441.88 442.77 A: somebody found a w- 

442.89 443.97 A: something but it it's 

444.09 444.44 B: pardon 

444.09 449.12 A: like you said they are on so many nights it's like didn't we used to have something else on at that time 

448.50 451.76 B: yeah i know exactly what was what was playing when the 

451.85 453.06 B: just shows weren't on 

453.33 454.32 A: i don't 

453.83 458.09 B: but yeah i i do uh i do every once in awhile i do want to watch um 

458.69 460.27 B: the music on american idol just 

460.46 460.83 B: see if 

460.56 461.02 A: yeah 

461.24 464.78 B: if i'll ever see if any of them it's kind of like star search i guess 

464.54 466.19 A: right -cause 

465.48 466.16 B: i know like that 

466.54 467.41 A: a few of those 

466.66 467.67 B: but i just never 

467.80 469.97 B: i never get a chance i have a young child so 

470.20 470.90 A: oh yes 

470.32 473.04 B: by the time she goes to bed i'm ready to go to bed too 

472.62 478.35 A: oh you bet and by that time at night you're getting her to bed and all that -cause i think it's on at like seven or eight something fairly early 

477.68 478.31 B: yeah 

478.53 479.05 B: yeah 

479.09 484.52 A: but you're right it's fun to watch because the guy the dark-haired guy that owns a record company is so rude 

484.28 486.26 B: oh yeah mhm yeah 

484.98 485.43 A: (( )) 

485.76 487.29 A: like 

486.83 488.21 B: i've seen i've seen his 

488.65 489.18 B: yeah 

489.44 491.73 A: can't help but wonder what's he going to say next 

491.77 492.47 B: yeah 

492.96 494.04 A: but um yeah it's kind of 

494.24 495.20 A: uh it's kind of a (( kick )) 

495.36 495.97 A: that one i 

496.28 498.25 A: i enjoy watching although 

498.73 503.52 A: they seem to be re-showing the same people over and over again it's like okay that's enough that's enough 

503.30 504.86 B: oh so they don't have new episodes 

505.28 508.23 A: they have um they bring back people from previous 

508.72 509.40 B: oh 

508.80 511.99 A: show that they canceled out and i don't know why 

512.23 513.30 A: (( )) 

512.91 513.35 B: hm 

514.03 515.44 B: yeah i don't i don't know 

515.72 517.63 B: um maybe they're maybe they are just kind of like 

517.78 518.44 B: they have to 

519.09 520.11 B: uh compete against 

520.62 522.12 B: half winners or something 

521.97 523.76 A: yeah uh that's all i can figure 

522.62 523.93 B: kind of like how star search was 

524.52 527.15 A: y- well and these are ones these are people they rejected 

527.64 528.07 B: pardon 

528.29 530.61 A: these are people they rejected so um 

530.10 532.02 B: oh the rejected people came back 

530.75 531.24 A: i don't 

532.03 532.72 A: yeah 

532.15 533.51 B: they're probably running out of 

533.63 534.80 B: contestants
