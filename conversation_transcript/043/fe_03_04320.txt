40.35 41.52 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah )) 

41.40 42.42 A: um 

41.71 47.59 B: well i was thinking about one the other day that's just really funny that this topic came up but 

47.80 51.35 B: yeah i'm twenty five so we're the same age basically 

51.68 52.71 B: you know 

52.86 58.97 B: i was in college and i had plans you know i had finally decided what i wanted to do what i wanted to study 

59.07 72.18 B: [lipsmack] and i was going to school in north carolina and i i was dating this guy that had a friend that was you know doing this you know doing studying what i wanted to study she was going to school out in tennessee 

72.55 86.81 B: it was like you know they had a really good program i checked into it i applied to the school i was you know getting all psyched up to go was you know going to finish up my current year in north carolina and then move out for the fall semester the next year 

87.05 89.48 B: and then i met this guy in january 

89.53 93.21 B: before the my semester in north carolina ended 

93.58 95.00 B: and you know 

95.06 103.46 B: we started dating hanging out and i was like i fell totally in love with the guy you know it's like this this is the one i want to spend the rest of my life with 

99.54 100.74 A: of course 

103.72 117.86 B: and then yeah we stayed together for a long time we moved in together so i you know i decided you know what i'm totally in love with this guy ah he's not ready you know to make a commitment to me because he was three years younger than me at the time 

117.97 120.41 B: (( and i was like you know )) 

120.42 122.79 B: i'm going to stay here and see what happens 

123.13 127.51 B: we ended up staying together for like a year and a half and then we broke up ooh 

127.69 135.46 B: that's no more and i completely changed my career path all because of that that is something i would so go back and change if i could 

135.90 148.98 A: yeah i could see that although i have to say that you know what in reality you probably learn more about yourself and life and everything else being in that relationship than having not been in it you know 

148.15 149.22 B: yeah 

149.48 154.40 A: but i yeah we do strange things for me we usually do i don't know why 

153.48 157.48 B: that's silly [laughter] unfortunately but you know 

158.04 159.79 A: yeah i mean i ah 

160.32 165.33 A: i would have to say that i mean i went to school in new orleans but i'm from new york born and raised 

164.58 165.13 B: (( oh )) 

165.36 170.00 A: and i went to school as far away as i possibly could to get away from 

170.22 179.20 A: everybody you know new york is a an interesting place but i was like okay i've had enough i need to go out and move out on my own but i went out there and completely like 

176.61 177.55 B: yeah 

179.39 181.51 A: severed ties with everybody 

181.60 195.59 A: you know like i turned around and said you know i think i called my parents like once a month [laughter] i never spoke to my sister i had a couple of good friends that i kept in touch with but the rest of them i was like oh whatever i'm out here in new orleans i don't you know i think you you know 

194.01 194.87 B: (( [noise] yeah uh-huh )) 

195.65 207.77 A: you run away and you go to a new place and you start all over again and you live a totally separate life and then all of a sudden you realize that you you know you've forgotten some people in it so now you've got to go back and you've got to kind of 

208.26 215.05 A: rebuild and start all over again include them in on everything that you've been doing for the last four years of your life 

214.85 215.87 B: (( [laughter] oh yeah yeah mm )) 

215.52 218.52 A: you know and and start all over again i think i i'm 

218.89 224.06 A: not saying i wouldn't have moved away because i think i mean i think i needed to get away from home 

223.37 224.28 B: (( right )) 

224.25 226.90 A: but i don't think when i done it i would have ah 

227.59 232.41 A: done it so cleanly you know just like cut ties 

230.59 231.54 B: yeah 

232.54 234.16 A: (( but other than that i mean )) 

232.66 233.46 B: (( oh yeah )) 

234.72 235.70 A: (( i i )) 

236.22 245.84 A: mean i think you could go back and say would have could have should have but i mean the reality is is as long as you're happy with who you are i mean even the mistakes must have gotten you where you are now you know 

245.30 247.77 B: yeah yeah uh-huh 

246.41 247.41 A: i try to 

247.75 250.09 A: i try not to regret too much [laughter] 

250.07 251.07 B: yeah 

251.22 252.56 A: what do you do now 

252.95 258.96 B: um i actually i ended up moving back home i live on my own but i'm back in my hometown so 

259.45 260.49 B: and i'm 

259.86 261.57 A: where in north carolina are you from 

261.54 263.15 B: um wilson 

264.23 266.69 B: it's sort of towards the east coast 

266.63 271.76 A: okay i've been ah couple of different places i'm i'm in the army so i know like the fort brag area 

271.67 273.03 B: oh okay yeah 

271.79 272.74 A: and ah 

272.84 276.52 A: yeah and ah i've been down to like the outer banks area 

276.32 277.24 B: mhm 

277.34 279.77 A: and ah ultimately that's where i want to live 

279.80 283.68 A: is ah the coastal area of north carolina i absolutely love it 

283.47 285.18 B: oh oh well [laughter] 

284.54 285.94 A: yeah so there you go 

286.74 289.55 B: yeah it's nice but i actually um my 

289.67 295.90 B: father just moved him and my step mother lived out at topsoil island i don't know if you've heard of that but 

295.33 296.19 A: yep 

297.22 298.01 B: so 

297.70 298.83 A: nice ah 

299.01 307.57 A: i just i want i like the water i like the weather i like the people i'm not a big fan of ah big city new york i mean and that's where i'm living now not by choice 

305.16 306.12 B: (( mhm oh )) 

307.65 308.70 B: (( okay )) 

308.73 309.65 A: but ah i 

310.41 312.61 A: don't know i mean like i 

312.75 316.79 A: i can't say that there's anything i would go back and significantly change 

316.71 317.86 B: (( yeah )) 

317.58 319.14 A: (( you know i don't know )) 

318.46 319.44 B: yeah 

320.66 326.54 A: i guess i guess we can both consider ourselves lucky that that's the only thing in life that we'd really need to go back and fix 

326.40 328.07 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

328.79 336.22 B: no that's i mean that's a hard hard thing to say because just like you know yeah things turned out okay but what if you know 

335.83 338.18 A: exactly and what if i had gone to 

338.33 341.99 A: exactly what if i had gone somewhere else what if i had done something different 

341.92 343.05 B: yeah 

342.67 352.59 A: you know i mean there's probably a couple of people in my life that maybe i i would go back and maybe either kick out of my life sooner or you know have not kicked out of my life you know 

352.39 353.57 B: yeah 

353.73 355.52 A: but those things come full circle 

355.59 360.14 B: yeah just wish you sort of kept in touch with people that before were just like go 

361.22 368.77 A: yeah yeah that is probably one of the things you know you meet people and and you f- you know and they're great but you go one way and they go the other 

368.76 369.85 B: yeah 

368.95 370.60 A: and it's like okay now what 

370.84 377.93 B: yeah [laughter] but i guess you just sort of put everything back together and you know just keep going 

378.01 378.85 A: yes 

379.98 383.88 A: v- very different conv- the last call that i did was on ah 

384.14 387.62 A: minimum wage so this s- this is a little 

387.74 390.94 A: it's a very different question than the last conversation i did 

387.87 388.57 B: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

389.70 390.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

390.94 392.65 B: yeah i think um 

393.34 396.43 B: i think mine was what do you look for in a lifetime partner 

396.80 398.66 B: that was interesting [laughter] 

398.71 404.97 A: yeah i guess i mean you definitely get to know some random person on the other end of the phone [laughter] h- 

403.30 404.49 B: yeah 

405.88 408.57 A: for the ten minutes that you're forced to talk to them 

408.43 409.54 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

409.62 412.33 B: but you know it goes by so quickly though [laughter] 

409.82 410.74 A: but ah 

412.13 420.34 A: it does all of a sudden now we were talking about minimum wage and next thing you know it was like okay your time's up and we were like oh nice talking to you [laughter] see you later 

418.86 420.15 B: (( i know [laughter] )) 

422.29 423.16 A: but ah 

422.42 423.20 B: well 

423.22 425.35 A: how did you end up doing this thing 

426.32 437.18 B: um i signed up here i do a lot of mystery shopping for different companies and this this happened to be i don't know how i got with this company because i'd never heard of them but they sent me an email 

430.68 431.55 A: mhm 

437.44 443.01 B: you know saying we have this and that bit and let's check what was available and signed up for this so 

443.78 445.07 A: that's interesting 

445.29 451.82 A: i found it by accident somebody told me about it but hey you you know sent me an email it was like hey check this out 

451.72 452.67 B: (( oh yeah )) 

452.03 452.91 A: but ah i 

452.95 459.01 A: guess somebody's must be studying our phone calls it's kind of an interesting idea [laughter] 

457.94 462.03 B: yeah what are what are they trying to find out do you know [laughter] i don't know 

461.40 464.49 A: i don't know i guess how people socialize i don't know 

465.17 475.81 A: two random people who have never met each other converse about ah i g- although it actually gets easier in some ways because you know i'm going to hang up the phone and you're not going to know who i am and i'm not going to know who you are 

475.65 478.82 B: right yeah you just tell them tell them whatever you know they're 

478.93 480.69 B: never going to know but 

480.14 481.30 A: (( exactly )) 

481.56 482.21 A: (( it's )) 

483.18 484.15 A: but ah 

484.66 489.11 B: um and ironically you're the only person i've ever admitted that to [laughter] 

484.68 485.88 A: now if you could 

488.86 489.99 A: what's that 

489.89 495.02 B: what i told you about you know about changing my plans for school yeah you're the only person i've ever told that tale to 

491.27 492.76 A: oh really 

494.91 497.00 A: see and your secret's safe with me 

496.71 498.74 B: [laughter] i hope so 

497.60 501.46 A: unless i go back to to wilson and find a girl named heather who's 

501.48 502.56 A: living in 

502.74 506.73 A: which i assure you i'm not going to do so don't worry about it 

506.51 511.67 B: [laughter] [laughter] probably be a little hard to figure out which heather you're looking for [laughter] 

507.74 508.59 A: i mean 

510.50 511.56 A: (( yeah )) 

511.58 523.72 A: well that's like ah you know that's i think that's why people get along so well on the online chatting and you hear about all these people you know meeting the love of their life on the personals because y- i mean i really think you're a lot more i mean you p- 

523.75 530.41 A: the internet makes you capable of lying a lot easier but it also makes you i think a lot more honest 

530.17 531.30 B: (( mhm mhm oh yeah )) 

531.05 531.96 A: (( you know )) 

532.03 539.74 A: because you put aside all the uncomfortability i mean i i can't count the number of people i know who are dating or or even marrying people that they've met online 

539.61 540.61 B: mhm 

540.79 546.22 A: you know and it seems kind of strange but then you realize like it's kind of like this you know it's just some random person 

546.46 548.13 A: you know why not tell them the truth 

548.07 549.41 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

549.67 551.24 A: (( what have you got to lose )) 

552.71 553.50 B: (( huh )) 

552.83 553.73 A: but ah 

554.62 563.29 A: other than that i we're not doing real well on the rest of this question though they'll listen to me like all right they they talked about the question for two minutes and spent eight minutes 

563.33 566.40 B: [laughter] i think we did good we're sort of 

563.47 564.55 A: bullshitting 

566.03 567.08 A: yeah 

566.72 569.00 B: keeping it in there [laughter] [laughter] 

568.39 569.44 A: [laughter] 

570.10 575.55 A: they can't expect you to talk for ten minutes on that i mean i g- guess unless somebody has some really serious 

576.50 579.95 A: you know life altering mistakes that they made [laughter] 

579.15 580.22 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

580.43 581.18 B: but 

581.26 585.70 B: i don't know how you feel it maybe different if you're you know fifty or sixty 

585.74 588.03 A: yeah a few more years to make some mistakes 

586.00 586.76 B: (( you know )) 

588.11 589.11 B: yeah 

589.83 594.09 A: i mean i i've been lucky i've never been divorced i don't have any kids 

594.79 595.75 A: and ah 

596.33 599.13 A: i've got a job that and i you know when i 

599.22 599.90 A: (( i've never b ))
