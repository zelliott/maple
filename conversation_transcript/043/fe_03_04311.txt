41.54 43.06 A: yeah 

42.19 52.93 B: that's a good desire [laughter] so let's see if i i i think if i were to go back i would change something very specific about my life um 

43.58 45.71 A: mhm [laughter] 

53.05 60.52 B: i'm i'm in the theatre and ah i'm an i'm an actor and i discovered that it's very important 

54.73 55.53 A: (( okay )) 

60.72 66.88 B: ah it's sad that it's like this but i think i would have chosen to go to a different school than the school i went to 

66.40 67.37 A: yes 

66.77 75.39 B: i got into a very very very good school and i chose not to go at the time and it seemed like the right decision at the time 

72.05 73.44 A: mhm 

75.23 85.93 B: but then later when i came to new york and i saw how this going to this school seemed to open doors for people and make opportunities then i sort of regretted it 

81.92 82.84 A: yes 

85.59 86.74 A: (( mm )) 

85.72 93.32 B: so even even though i've done okay and i ah you know i'm doing okay now it seems it took so much longer 

90.19 91.17 A: yeah 

92.94 94.26 A: yeah 

93.39 96.71 B: to get you know the kind of success i wanted 

95.40 98.23 A: (( success that you wanted yeah mm )) 

96.90 103.30 B: because this our country is so into you know well where did you go to school and where did you grow up and 

102.07 104.45 A: (( yeah yeah what are your credentials )) 

104.55 105.58 B: pardon me 

105.09 106.94 A: where where are your credentials 

106.64 110.88 B: well i mean i act- i went to stanford university which is a great school 

110.30 111.44 A: yeah 

110.75 123.69 B: but for theatre i went to a school in san diego and um i got into the yale school of drama which is one of the top ah schools um but but at the time they wanted a lot of money from me 

113.92 114.81 A: (( okay )) 

118.31 120.71 A: oh yes one of the best yeah 

123.21 124.15 A: (( oh )) 

123.59 129.43 B: and that i didn't really feel i could afford [laughter] you know and i didn't want to take out a loan 

124.86 127.15 A: (( okay [sigh] [laughter] )) 

129.04 130.30 A: right 

129.67 136.84 B: that would you know keep you know that i'd have to have over me you know ah like a shadow for years and years and years 

132.37 133.32 A: pay 

134.79 135.76 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

136.16 139.36 A: (( endlessly [laughter] yeah )) 

137.52 139.37 B: exactly so 

139.14 152.57 B: so i thought okay and i was young and i thought you know i'll just get good training here at this other school in san diego where they were paying me in a sense to come there um and i just didn't want to start my life as a young person with a huge debt 

146.97 149.16 A: right mhm 

152.08 153.72 A: right right 

153.12 159.63 B: but i look i look now at the way the world has turned out [laughter] and you know 

157.06 158.10 A: yeah 

159.20 161.29 A: aren't you glad that you went that one 

161.37 171.38 B: well i mean i ah in a way i wish i had the you know if i could change it i wish i'd gone to that school 'cause i think i would have been more successful faster 

169.94 172.76 A: successful mhm well 

171.84 177.90 B: 'cause 'cause i'm you know america cares about things like that where do you work where'd you go to school what neighborhood do you live in 

175.83 177.05 A: school 

177.29 178.64 A: right 

177.99 182.11 B: you know it's sad but it it unfortunately it's that way 

181.71 186.90 A: (( even though did did they ask you ah ah 'bout a p._i._n. number 'cause i ain't got no p._i._n. number )) 

187.15 188.94 A: (( did they say anything to you 'bout one )) 

188.82 202.07 B: ah no but i think because they contacted you they know who you are yeah yeah so you didn't have to worry yeah you don't have to worry about it so you you wanna talk a little more about what you were you know how you would change things 

191.55 196.33 A: (( oh they know who it is okay i see so when i had to do that right )) 

196.57 197.47 A: (( okay )) 

201.47 203.45 A: (( yes i would um )) 

203.90 208.46 A: [lipsmack] and another thing i would like to change is the um 

208.74 218.40 A: [sigh] the different plagues and the aids virus and [sigh] ah this sars you know mean i wish it would be 

214.05 215.17 B: (( mm )) 

218.41 223.58 A: (( ah [mn] quicker way you know that people could come across a cure )) 

223.48 224.65 B: yeah 

223.72 234.10 A: for these you know for these viruses that's killing so many people i mean i am so surprised about how many people the figures as they giving about this sars 

233.93 234.92 B: mm 

233.97 240.70 A: virus that anytime i'm on the bus somewhere and i hear somebody cough i'm i'm just i'm cringing 

240.14 242.20 B: yeah you're nervous yeah 

241.10 250.57 A: you know what i mean [laughter] and ah and ah they keep saying that it's a guy that came up with 

242.89 244.16 B: yeah 

250.68 255.91 A: (( some that that keeping the ah ah the aids virus from )) 

255.98 267.35 A: entering the cell they said they can apply this same technique to the sars virus so i'm saying if they can do that you know [cough] why w- w- you know what's taking so long 

260.17 260.87 B: mm 

267.12 268.32 B: yeah 

267.69 275.76 A: you know mean because i forgot what the body count is now you know in china and hong kong and different places but it's high 

275.52 276.79 B: mhm 

276.67 277.62 A: (( you know )) 

277.30 283.47 B: yeah so if you could go back you would like make the virus never have come or you would 

282.35 291.21 A: (( i i i i would make it never have come or have a c- a cure you know a quick a quick cure you know )) 

288.48 289.69 B: yeah 

290.98 292.11 B: yeah 

291.49 300.90 A: that you know not a long drawn out test and trying this and ah it's starting with the animals with the monkeys and the and the rats you know 

300.37 301.55 B: mhm 

301.82 306.68 A: yeah i wish it was something that you could just give to the human human being right away 

301.83 302.96 B: yeah 

306.55 314.79 B: well but what about i'm just gonna i'm gonna just play devil's advocate for ya but what about the fact that you know people have to die somehow 

310.58 311.61 A: right 

314.11 315.71 A: right you're right 

315.01 316.80 B: (( you know and so )) 

315.98 319.34 A: (( yes all that too or the world would be over populated )) 

318.73 322.75 B: yeah so i think maybe these things happen just to 

321.34 323.32 A: happen for a reason 

323.00 334.72 B: to get rid of us [laughter] but some of the disea- i mean but it seems like sars could have been prevented 'cause from what i've read about it it's like 

324.03 328.66 A: right right [laughter] you're right mhm 

334.69 346.85 B: in china the animals were working so the human beings and the animals were so close together and it wasn't hygienic and i mean that just seems like that that possibly could have been prevented 

339.88 342.82 A: right right mhm 

346.29 351.68 A: because the first case it was a nurse that had the insight 

351.73 353.04 A: (( that she had of )) 

353.28 360.73 A: previous news and she [noise] took it upon herself to ah isolate this particular person 

360.58 361.70 B: mhm 

360.83 366.20 A: and when she did that that helped to keep a lot of people from get 

366.22 374.73 A: from this virus passing on so that was one person that was real thoughtful and she didn't even know what really was going on but she knew 

370.96 372.13 B: mhm 

374.65 384.33 A: that this case should be isolated and not to have no visitors and you know ah ah ah wearing masks and you know all the protective gear that you should have 

376.81 377.87 B: yeah 

382.09 383.26 B: mhm 

384.01 392.80 B: right right right well you sound like a very like a very caring person that you wanna you know make the world a better place

399.47 400.62 B: mhm 

401.38 416.06 B: yeah oh that's great well my my answer seems so shallow compared to yours [laughter] i'm like i wanna be more successful so i wish i'd gone to the right school and then i would be rich and famous [laughter] but you know actually it's ah 

405.39 407.29 A: [laughter]

421.44 426.68 B: you know i had a i had someone tell me once that like a counselor he said look he said people 

426.75 428.90 B: things work out in the long run 

428.67 429.92 A: mhm 

428.90 437.84 B: and you wind up where your supposed to be so you don't have to worry about making a wrong turn here or there like it's a life or death situation 

437.42 439.35 A: right right mhm 

437.71 446.15 B: you know but in the long run if you keep your eye on what it is that you wanna do that you know opportunities will come your way 

445.72 446.80 A: right 

446.19 458.67 B: so don't lose sleep over it but there were years where i just was like oh no i went to the wrong school and in fact at one point i even put on my resume that i had been accepted to the school
