9.75 11.43 A: you go ahead 

10.70 19.42 B: [laughter] oh that that's actually a very hard question to answer i was hoping they'd give us like a question about where we would time travel to 

19.73 20.86 B: um 

20.98 22.57 A: would you want to 

23.49 33.67 B: well i don't know i i i don't know if i would because i can't think of like any one thing in my life that i ever did that was so bad that i feel like i need to go back and change 

32.74 35.00 A: yeah that's me and 

34.11 35.12 B: (( i mean )) 

35.18 40.05 A: and even and if you did i mean um you wouldn't be the person you are today 

40.28 45.15 B: yeah that's true yeah because you'd have to think about th- everything that would change it 

45.59 51.73 B: and yeah i you know i kind of think about that that you know i don't who knows what ramifications it would have 

51.77 52.62 B: (( you know like )) 

51.83 52.90 A: right 

52.87 53.77 B: (( i )) 

53.79 68.26 B: mean i don't know if i picked you know go to a different college or something i mean that would change like all the friendships that i have and you know maybe change where i was working and yeah that could just change so much stuff but 

62.82 64.26 A: everything 

68.40 82.26 B: i don't know if if there was something you know if i had done something at some point in my life really stupid or i don't know illegal or idiotic or something i might want to go back and change it but i i don't th- i don't think i've done anything that 

77.46 79.54 A: [laughter] there you go 

82.19 84.69 B: was that bad that i can't live with 

84.49 87.76 A: maybe things in history i might have changed 

88.04 88.98 A: you know 

88.27 89.78 B: yeah that's true 

89.39 92.46 A: not my own personal history but 

91.83 92.97 B: right 

93.85 99.04 A: i'm trying to i'm trying to think of i'm not really sure what i would change [laughter] 

94.49 95.24 B: (( ah )) 

98.92 103.10 B: maybe if you could like go back and kill hitler when he was [laughter] 

102.17 104.66 A: there you go something like that 

103.21 104.97 B: play god 

105.30 107.53 B: do something that yeah that prevents 

108.13 109.48 A: a tragedy 

109.39 114.25 B: yeah some major major negative thing like that that's happened but 

114.96 116.44 B: but yeah i think 

116.62 118.78 B: (( you know i don't i don't know if )) 

118.83 125.05 B: i mean i guess if you i guess if in theory if you decided okay i'm going to back and change something in my own life 

125.17 133.99 B: i guess you wouldn't know then that things would be different so i mean i you know what i mean i mean like if i did go back say and change where i went to school 

134.03 135.33 B: ah you know i guess 

135.90 142.30 B: then in my new life i wouldn't know what this life was like i guess 

140.84 144.53 A: that's true that's true i didn't s- think of it from that angle 

144.18 151.65 B: yeah i mean i i guess there wouldn't be anything to miss because i wouldn't know i wouldn't know that alternate life so 

150.51 156.46 A: or you might if you chose to go back in the first place and you're going to remember where you came from 

155.98 157.58 B: well that's true 

157.19 163.03 A: [laughter] see we really don't have any idea how it works do we [laughter] 

158.77 159.63 B: (( now that's )) 

161.09 167.67 B: yeah [laughter] yeah that's the problem [laughter] yeah there's too much unknown stuff but 

163.55 165.31 A: [laughter] 

167.07 167.75 A: (( yeah )) 

168.13 171.40 B: i you know i i i can't think of anything 

173.19 178.15 A: yeah not in my personal life i don't think there's not one thing i would really change 

173.63 174.86 B: (( that [lipsmack] )) 

177.96 180.38 B: yeah y- there there's nothing that i 

180.82 182.86 B: regret that much 

183.27 190.84 A: i okay i there there's one thing that here recently that's happened i had that i think i would go back and would have stayed at home 

190.75 201.55 A: is about four months ago i had gone out of town for a night and um when i came home my cat of thirteen years was gone just disappeared 

201.44 202.55 B: (( i mean oh )) 

202.16 206.92 A: and something like that i'd go back in time and stay home and make sure that he was still around 

206.27 207.47 B: yeah 

207.33 211.70 A: because i really miss him so something like that i might go back and 

211.19 212.39 B: yeah 

212.07 214.81 A: just to see if i could prevent it from happening 

215.87 219.74 B: yeah that's true that's a yeah that's a good example 

220.62 225.12 B: yeah actually now see that makes me think about my cat that died like two years ago and [laughter] 

225.24 228.13 B: and we had um we had moved to 

228.16 234.85 B: nebraska and um i lived in sort of like six months ah my husband wasn't here yet but i i rented like this 

234.77 241.26 B: really old house and it had a basement that she liked to get into and i didn't like her going down there because i didn't know what was down there 

241.16 253.31 B: and then we moved into this new house and it was like three or four months later that she died and my husband and i just like always wonder if you know if maybe there was something in that old house that she got into 

253.32 256.59 B: you know that that ended up making her sick or something 

256.64 257.53 B: so 

257.01 259.74 A: could have easily been something that she she 

258.93 270.27 B: yeah and i've often and i have actually often thought gosh i wish i hadn't moved into that house you know i wish i'd found like a nicer newer place that you know i knew couldn't have any old 

270.45 272.91 B: (( toxins or any bad stuff )) 

271.46 274.77 A: right or lead lead paint and [laughter] 

273.02 274.22 B: (( but yeah )) 

274.41 278.19 B: yeah because i just didn't know you know it was just such an old house and 

277.49 279.89 A: and you never went down in the basement there 

279.71 284.59 B: i i did and i put a door up so that she couldn't go down but occasionally like the 

284.43 295.08 B: the um washing machine was down in the basement so like occasionally when i would go down to do laundry she would sneak down there or something and you know it was like it was like one of those basements that like a bunch of the walls were just 

294.94 305.67 B: dirt even and stuff and just like i say it was creepy i mean i tried to avoid it [laughter] but but yeah actually that that might be something that 

297.19 297.97 A: (( ew )) 

298.89 302.17 A: yeah it sounds creepy and i wasn't even there whoa [laughter] 

305.49 317.21 B: that i would change because yeah i did you know after that happened after she died you know my husband and i both were like kind of looking back on you know is there is there something that we did wrong or that you know that we could have done differently 

316.34 326.21 A: right and and well that that goes to yeah it just it's broadening my my opinion now yeah if i could go back and you know hindsight's always twenty twenty 

325.94 327.00 B: yeah 

326.31 332.24 A: and and and no matter you know what happens and it's yeah if i could go back and just pay more attention 

332.33 333.46 B: yeah 

332.70 339.10 A: [laughter] i might do that and things might turn out differently just to just to know to pay more attention 

335.64 336.61 B: yeah 

339.76 341.48 B: yeah because if you had the 

341.57 346.54 B: i guess the knowledge that you have now and could apply that to [laughter] 

346.84 350.53 A: yeah go back and use use that and 

349.89 351.11 B: yeah 

351.46 354.12 B: yeah it'd be kind of kind of like if you were 

354.28 356.57 B: like like i've often thought that like 

357.08 361.88 B: the it'd be neat if as an adult to go back and and be a kid 

362.03 365.95 B: and be able to you know have like the energy of kids and the 

365.25 367.49 A: [laughter] i wish that all the time 

366.26 370.78 B: but not responsibilities that they have the you know summers off 

368.75 371.54 A: just the freedom of thought yeah 

370.69 381.99 B: yeah exactly but to but to be like to have the brain of an adult you know [laughter] i mean to so that you could appreciate it because like when i was a child i don't think i appreciated stuff like that 

381.93 383.53 A: yeah right 

382.77 385.40 B: so if you went back now 

384.52 388.07 A: and now you think about those were the good old days 

387.46 393.69 B: yeah so yeah so if i went back now to like i don't know when i was twelve or something 

393.76 399.63 B: knowing what i know now i'd probably appreciate it more i guess and i would 

399.01 405.27 A: or you might be one of those smart alec kids thinking you know it all [laughter] 

401.60 402.48 B: [laughter] 

402.89 404.92 B: well that's true [laughter] 

405.02 414.16 B: yeah people not might not like me very much if i was too much of an adult in a little kid's body i might i might annoy ah my peers [laughter] 

406.95 408.33 A: [laughter] 

408.56 410.09 A: (( [laughter] yeah right )) 

413.40 414.56 A: [laughter] 

415.18 422.22 B: but yeah i would i mean i- it would be interes- it'd be nice if you could i don't know somehow you could go back and maybe 

422.25 427.33 B: change select things but know that for the most part your life was going to stay the same 

427.03 431.40 A: yeah that would just tweak it just tweak it some yeah 

427.68 428.71 B: (( you know )) 

429.35 430.46 B: yeah 

430.70 440.95 B: because like i think about like that you know like like with your cat or with my cat or something you know if i could i mean i'd still like my life to be what it is today but for her to be in it if 

439.29 443.96 A: it would be so much yeah thank you yes it would be so much greater to have 

441.79 442.86 B: you could just 

443.54 446.41 B: yeah just change that that one part 

446.04 447.05 A: yeah 

446.43 450.77 B: but know that it wouldn't have like major ripple effects on 

450.82 452.64 B: on the rest of your life 

452.62 459.43 A: and that's it that's i think why um um i would be kind of reluctant to change anything because it is a ripple effect 

459.10 461.15 B: yeah and you don't know 

461.41 466.55 B: what it might take away from you or things that you want to keep in your life [laughter] 

464.29 465.04 A: y- 

465.96 467.12 A: right 

466.85 474.58 B: that it might that you might end up losing i mean i guess you'd assumedly you'd be going back to make something better but you might end up 

474.29 476.18 A: messing up the whole game plan 

475.96 480.18 B: yeah you might you know you might end up with things that you don't want 

480.39 484.74 B: and in which case you might rather keep things the way they are now [laughter] 

485.66 486.84 B: (( i don't know )) 

487.10 488.22 B: it'd be nice if 

487.61 492.47 A: well what if we could just go back and just to view just to see 

492.36 498.76 B: well that's what i was going to say you know if you could yeah if you could somehow just see like what what would happen if you changed that one thing [laughter] 

498.37 506.97 A: [mn] yeah that would be interesting i'd be game for that okay do i want it this way or do i want to keep it the other way yeah 

501.27 502.85 B: yeah and then 

505.21 506.21 B: yeah 

506.45 510.61 B: yeah because then you'd have the you'd you could make an informed decision i guess 

509.89 511.09 A: (( there you go )) 

510.79 513.14 B: at that point if you did it that way 

513.55 517.79 B: but i guess it probably i'm assuming it probably wouldn't work that way [laughter] 

517.30 519.58 A: yeah well [laughter] we- 

519.07 521.76 B: they probably wouldn't give you that much choice 

522.37 524.20 B: but that would be the 

524.31 525.83 B: that'd be ideal 

526.05 538.54 B: because then you could then you could try out all sorts of different possibilities you know like stuff just for fun maybe stuff that you didn't even really feel like you needed to change but just thought well i wonder what would happen if you know i 

539.21 541.89 B: took a different job or something you know 

541.89 544.71 A: or took a different road even you know [laughter] 

544.04 550.45 B: yeah yeah just one night when you're driving if you just said okay let me just go somewhere different or 

549.67 550.94 A: yeah 

550.52 555.63 B: stay home instead of going out or go out instead of staying home and just kind of see 

555.72 559.40 B: you know and did that have a major impact on your life 

559.68 561.77 A: that would be quite interesting 

561.87 564.91 B: yeah to see those those alternate 

565.35 567.95 B: alternate realities i guess [laughter] 

566.33 567.41 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

568.03 574.17 B: the alternates of what your life could have been or or would have been in and then sit back and choose 

575.65 578.73 B: it's kind of it's sort of ah did you see the movie um 

579.81 581.62 B: minority report 

581.05 582.67 A: yes i did 

581.98 589.83 B: tom cruise it kind of makes me think of that because like you know that was kind of what they were doing was you know they were i mean they were altering 

582.83 583.82 A: uh-huh 

588.37 589.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

590.70 593.33 B: they were kind of altering the future really by 

593.56 595.91 B: knowing what somebody was going to do 

595.11 599.89 A: yeah and to prevent them from doing yeah that's true j- kind of the opposite almost
