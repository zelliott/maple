15.46 18.64 B: yeah i i'm in new york city so yeah 

16.90 21.46 A: oh everybody i've talked to has been in new york it's very odd yeah 

19.70 20.60 B: really 

20.83 23.56 B: there's been a lot of ads around here i that's probably why 

23.29 24.89 A: oh really [noise] 

23.83 30.24 B: yeah so i don't know this is my first time doing this so what about time travel would you go back in time 

29.82 36.01 A: [noise] um [sigh] i don't think i'd go back in time but i might want to go forward in time 

36.70 41.71 B: mhm yeah i don't think i don't i've kinda think it's like you know you should just use the past to 

42.06 45.00 B: change the future you know what i mean but i don't know 

44.68 52.48 A: but yeah maybe i've watched too many movies but i think i'd be afraid if i went back in the past that i'd change something that would 

52.96 54.14 B: right right 

53.55 55.39 A: you know be too critical 

55.11 56.45 B: right and like 

55.73 59.48 A: even if you didn't realise it you know something little could just snowball 

59.08 61.32 B: and right throw everything else off 

61.46 62.69 B: definitely 

62.16 63.40 A: yeah 

62.74 65.81 B: so what would you do if you went into the future 

65.56 66.73 A: um 

66.39 67.25 B: (( [noise] )) 

66.80 71.07 A: i'd probably just stand there with my mouth open [laughter] 

69.23 70.83 B: [laughter] 

71.64 75.10 B: yeah i don't know it'd be kind of weird but 

75.92 81.15 B: [mn] so yeah i don't really know how we're supposed to talk for ten minutes about these topics but 

81.33 86.94 A: [noise] w- well what we've i don't know before the topics have been [noise] things that just kinda led to other things [noise] w- 

86.72 87.62 B: uh-huh 

87.67 90.95 B: what kinda what what were the some of the other things that you've come across 

90.17 93.82 A: w- um one night we had to talk about pets 

93.62 94.46 B: uh-huh 

94.29 97.91 A: and one night we had to talk about sports on t._v. 

97.48 98.78 B: mhm 

98.79 100.07 A: and um 

100.37 102.72 A: those are the only two calls i've had 

102.08 103.06 B: got ya 

103.28 104.64 A: (( but um )) 

105.78 106.58 B: so 

105.86 110.18 A: so a- there's actually been ads like in the paper and stuff or do you go to school 

109.83 120.86 B: ah i go to school here [noise] but i was reading one of the local newspapers and there was just an ad and it said get paid to talk on the phone and i was like all right i don't think that you could get much easier than that but 

111.33 112.24 A: uh-huh 

120.01 124.76 A: no well and from what i understand they're doing some kind of a linguistics study 

124.39 125.68 B: mhm 

125.23 128.33 A: and so they just wanna get a whole bunch of different speech patterns 

127.97 132.88 B: right right right so i don't know how did you come across this 

129.69 130.89 A: (( [noise] so )) 

131.05 131.68 A: (( uh )) 

132.51 133.71 A: on the internet 

133.49 134.57 B: oh really 

134.01 136.34 A: yeah there was some kinda board [noise] 

135.71 136.59 B: uh-huh 

137.31 142.34 B: that's pretty cool yeah i don't know have you when do they send the checks the important part 

141.80 142.88 A: i don't know 

142.98 144.83 A: but the board that i 

144.90 148.86 A: you know found it on the people indicated they'd already been getting paid so 

148.01 149.52 B: mm oh wow 

149.32 152.79 A: 'cause i saw it a couple of weeks ago and i thought yeah right [mn] 

153.05 157.92 B: right right yeah i was i was kind of sceptical it seemed too simple but 

153.96 155.17 A: but um 

158.03 159.61 B: (( so [mn] )) 

159.89 170.27 A: so yeah i i when you talk time travel i keep thinking you know back to the future and all those crazy movies and orson welles and all that 

164.41 165.45 B: yep 

166.32 167.54 B: exactly 

169.61 178.48 B: mhm yeah i never i never saw back to the future [noise] [noise] random anecdote [noise] no it wasn't something i'd seen before but [noise] that's my cellphone [noise] um 

173.42 174.46 A: oh you didn't 

179.24 183.16 B: [noise] yeah i don't know i'm i'm i'm from the younger generation so [laughter] 

182.72 183.60 A: mm 

183.17 187.05 B: i wasn't around for orson welles or but i i'm familiar with it so 

187.65 188.28 B: (( [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

188.81 190.82 B: but yeah so 

190.69 193.27 A: how far into the future would you like to go 

193.43 197.79 B: um i don't know i think i i wouldn't go more than 

198.12 201.70 B: i wouldn't go more than you know maybe like a year or two 

201.88 205.19 B: just because i wouldn't i i don't know i'd rather like 

205.38 208.67 B: i i wouldn't wanna ruin not ruin the surprise but you know what i mean 

209.03 214.77 B: i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want that to affect my actions once i got back to current time or 

214.43 216.49 A: [noise] oh yeah i didn't think about that well 

215.85 217.01 B: what about you 

216.54 219.82 A: that'd be kinda scary [noise] seeing yourself in the future 

217.83 218.74 B: yeah 

219.96 223.56 A: and if you went too far into the future it might be really depressing 

223.15 225.66 B: ex- [laughter] exactly right 

223.69 224.96 A: [laughter] 

225.59 230.09 A: i was thinking of going like if you went into the future just beyond 

230.22 239.49 A: when you were alive you know like into the next generation or two or you know to maybe a hundred years from now [noise] or something just to see what the world was like 

233.50 234.57 B: oh that's 

235.13 236.35 B: right right 

239.04 241.63 B: that would be pretty interesting what do you think it would be like 

241.86 243.65 A: it's really hard to tell 

243.31 244.41 B: mhm 

243.86 244.89 A: um 

245.81 251.59 A: i don't know i mean eventually it'll all blow up i think it just can't sustain all the 

249.03 249.89 B: right 

251.70 254.09 A: it can't sustain [noise] 

254.65 262.34 A: it can only sustain a certain amount of life and something will have to give at some point when whenever that point is i don't know 

259.00 259.97 B: right 

263.20 265.51 B: yeah definitely so 

264.60 273.29 A: but i read a lot of science fiction so i've got all these bizarre pictures in my mind of you know spaceships and monsters and [laughter] 

265.52 266.08 B: (( [mn] )) 

272.08 276.90 B: right the apocalypse and other such uplifting topics [laughter] 

273.92 274.96 A: yeah 

276.20 280.01 A: yeah and weird cities and all that stuff 

279.47 281.07 B: right right 

281.08 289.46 A: you know i'd wanna um if i went into the future man i'd wanna be able to get back to my time with a push of a button or something you know i'd be so scared 

287.15 296.03 B: that's that's what i was gonna say was yeah so you would you would want the ability to go back to the to the to the then present time 

295.61 296.77 A: (( mhm )) 

296.11 297.85 B: mhm 

298.04 298.96 B: yeah that would 

298.10 300.13 A: and maybe they could fix it so 

300.68 302.59 A: you didn't remember any of it 

302.33 309.59 B: right that would be yeah that would be good if if they if that was an option then i would i would check out every minute of my future [laughter] 

308.97 312.65 A: [laughter] course you'd never know you'd done it then but 

309.93 310.90 B: but 

312.03 317.96 B: right just for the novelty at the time but i'd like like we said before i wouldn't wanna ruin the ah 

318.71 320.40 B: going once i went back 

320.63 322.23 B: but 

322.42 323.62 B: so i don't know 

326.14 326.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

326.81 329.35 B: (( um let's see [laughter] )) 

330.65 332.78 B: if you had to choose 

333.13 334.30 B: um 

334.70 339.17 B: if you had to choose between going to the past and going to the future you which one would you go for 

339.53 343.49 A: oh i would definitely go to the future mhm 

341.05 342.93 B: you'd go with that one mm 

343.06 351.46 B: so what about if you had the ability and you were forced to go into the past would you take the opportunity to change things or would you leave them as they were 

351.44 354.67 A: i would try not to change anything 

354.29 355.49 B: mhm 

354.95 356.37 A: 'cause i just think 

357.09 361.43 A: no matter what you did it would have some kind of a ripple effect 

360.98 362.26 B: mhm 

361.78 366.26 A: that you know even if it was some really small thing you did 

366.60 369.62 A: you couldn't know the repercussions of it 

368.97 370.59 B: right right 

370.20 371.52 A: and um 

371.71 379.50 A: yeah who knows how many lives you'd totally screw up or obliterate just from that one little thing you did [noise] 

376.64 377.72 B: right and 

379.06 385.70 B: exactly be- you know just being behind one second and doing something could throw off everything and that pro- 

384.24 387.70 A: yeah i i i mean you can think about well as in 

388.31 394.71 A: do the world some good if you could go back and you know eliminate hitler before he came into power or 

394.31 395.39 B: right 

394.77 398.56 A: saddam hussein or you know something like that but 

397.80 405.72 B: right and it's kind of weird too you know if you if you try to imagine hypothetically where would we be if if those events didn't happen 

405.76 412.92 B: you know like where how would things be different now you know what i mean if somebody could go back in time and stop all of you know what i mean 

412.79 419.18 A: yeah i mean how do you know if you'd even exist if you did that even though it's you know 

415.95 417.19 B: exactly 

419.70 421.76 A: the other side of the world from you 

421.52 423.31 B: mhm 

424.37 431.81 B: yeah it's definitely just i don't know it's it's kind of s- it's kind of scary do you think do you think that it that it will it will ever be a possibility [noise] 

434.08 435.09 A: um 

436.18 438.88 A: well it's a it's another dimension 

438.50 439.80 B: mhm 

439.22 440.31 A: um 

444.03 445.26 B: (( [mn] i )) 

445.72 447.28 B: don't know i think 

446.74 450.91 A: i don't really think so i just don't see how you could ever do it 

450.25 453.05 B: right like i- it's physically 

453.21 455.65 B: basically impossible i guess you know 

454.78 456.34 A: yeah 

456.46 457.34 B: so 

457.70 458.52 B: (( i don't know )) 

457.76 462.09 A: i mean i i think we can figure out how to transport ourselves from 

462.67 464.53 A: location to location 

464.32 465.28 B: right 

464.70 470.77 A: you know like a doctor w- like star trek you know materialize and dematerialize i think we can figure that out 

470.30 471.49 B: mhm 

471.07 474.20 A: more easily than going back and forth in time safely 

473.79 476.17 B: definitely yeah 

476.93 487.55 B: so w- do you think would the novelty of possibly being able to do that will be view- you know like if they were ha- doing experiments of seeing whether they could or they couldn't would you volunteer 

487.11 488.93 A: no [laughter] 

488.03 490.04 B: [laughter] yeah me neither [laughter] 

489.44 491.69 A: i'd be too chicken [laughter] 

490.58 491.45 B: yeah 

491.79 496.00 B: that's definitely not my in- [noise] not the idea of something that i would want to experiment with 

497.69 499.09 B: (( but [mn] m- )) 

499.73 500.79 A: but um 

502.38 504.29 A: (( you know they'd almost have to )) 

504.49 506.27 A: like experiment with 

506.55 511.15 A: animals or something or send cameras back and forth otherwise 

511.41 513.41 A: you'd never know if it worked or not 

512.78 516.58 B: right that's true you could be sending people into oblivion 

516.60 518.47 A: yeah who knows m- you know 

517.63 519.31 B: right 

520.14 522.05 B: (( definitely [mn] )) 

522.78 525.87 B: trying to think of what else is related to time travel 

526.95 528.18 B: um 

533.08 537.33 B: [lipsmack] if you had the power to change past events without actually going back [noise] 

537.39 538.41 B: would you 

539.39 540.25 A: (( mm mm )) 

540.17 546.40 B: to you so you'd still go with the whole thing of possibly messing with the present mhm 

544.92 546.88 A: yeah i think so 

548.12 551.01 B: yeah that's definitely a a good point so 

551.97 556.19 A: but a- would you what would you change if you could go back and change the past [noise] 

555.55 563.41 B: i don't know that's the thing i i'd [noise] i have no complaints as of yet in my life so i don't i couldn't think of anything that i'd want to change you know 

563.85 568.90 B: so and like you said i would just be afraid that i would screw up something good that i have now 

568.60 569.93 A: mhm 

569.15 570.18 B: so 

570.48 576.66 B: it'd just it's just a weird concept i guess what do you think about do you think most people would be willing to do with it 

576.80 578.88 A: i don't know i mean well 

579.21 582.70 A: people that have real unpleasant things in their lives would 

583.62 590.02 A: might wanna [noise] have the opportunity to go back and fix it before it ever happened 

589.55 590.84 B: mhm 

590.44 597.21 A: you know like st- if somebody in your family died in a car wreck or was murdered or something like that 

596.59 597.94 B: right right
