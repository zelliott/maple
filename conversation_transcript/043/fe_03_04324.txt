0.33 3.66 B: hello my name's tim and i'm in los angeles 

3.48 7.20 A: hey tim my name is carl and i'm in austin texas 

6.77 11.66 B: hey carl nice to meet you so time travel what do you think of that going back in time 

8.42 9.25 A: (( ah )) 

10.38 17.24 A: oh i i think it's a pretty cool idea i don't know if i'd go back and change anything 'cause then i'd be a different person 

17.32 22.12 B: yeah exactly it's almost hard to imagine how many different things could be changed 

18.15 19.35 A: [laughter] 

22.13 23.21 B: (( you know )) 

23.28 25.19 B: yeah you would be a different person 

25.15 26.42 A: you know who knows 

25.31 31.76 B: and how do you know like something you changed wouldn't by some chain of cause and effect like hurt somebody you like you know 

31.83 37.90 A: right or i might yeah 'cause i might not i definitely would not be where i am right now well i i might be it's like maybe 

31.96 32.81 B: (( right )) 

33.14 34.12 B: yeah 

37.53 38.63 B: really 

38.01 46.90 A: ah who is it mark twain was ah i forget i forget the word right now he believed he was a predeterminationist he thought that no matter what you did your life was set 

39.68 41.82 B: (( hm )) 

47.06 49.15 B: yes right 

48.18 54.50 A: so you could go back and change things but it wouldn't matter 'cause things would end up being the same way anyway [laughter] 

52.80 67.35 B: right that's interesting well i don't know i i mean i have serious doubts about whether you could actually go back in time i mean it seems to be physically impossible and logically impossible like you know how could you like stop your own birth 

65.22 67.55 A: yeah so far as we can tell 

67.71 74.56 A: ah i don't know i read i read a lot of science fiction as a kid so i i've [laughter] i've been through all all those thoughts 

70.72 71.96 B: oh yeah 

72.28 73.14 B: well 

73.24 81.29 B: [laughter] what about the little paradox of like going back in time and like killing your own parents so you were never born i mean how do you resolve that [noise] 

80.15 88.58 A: well i would personally believe that there are an infinite number of realities so i would go to the go to the one where they were never born but somehow i magically was [laughter] 

86.18 92.11 B: oh that's a good possibility yeah like there's at every point there's a branching off of all the different possibilities 

91.53 94.53 A: right and 

92.54 95.05 B: that's kind of cool i like that idea 

94.99 102.00 A: i i don't know how i would don't know how i would come about if they weren't here but i'm sure there is a way for it to happen [laughter] 

95.34 96.71 B: 'cause that means like 

101.08 112.41 B: yeah no that's cool though but i mean if you think about it that means there are in- not only are there infinite possibilities but everything must exist like there's a universe where like my cat is like the queen of the universe 

112.06 115.21 A: exactly exactly yeah 

112.89 113.62 B: (( you know )) 

113.89 120.37 B: and that's yeah it's really cool to imagine [laughter] yes and that makes science fiction science fact [laughter] 

115.97 118.53 A: thats the corollary [laughter] 

120.61 124.42 A: ah but let's see to play pretend gosh i just 

122.99 124.92 B: (( hm )) 

124.63 128.08 A: there there are so many things that could be different i don't know 

128.43 143.05 A: actually one th- one thing i would pro- one thing i would change i don't know if this would make a difference or not but in our our little eighth grade dance i was really rude to a girl because i liked her sister and i wouldn't i didn't dance with her 'cause i kept wanting to dance with her sister and we all ended up being friends and stuff in high school 

131.12 134.01 B: (( hm )) 

138.27 139.59 B: (( mhm oh )) 

140.16 141.48 B: oh no 

142.67 143.71 B: yeah 

142.98 146.75 A: but i i've always just every now and then i'll think well you know i wish i was a little nicer then 

146.77 154.77 B: oh i know what you mean like sometimes we torture ourselves for years over like one tiny thing which the other person probably doesn't even remember yeah 

151.04 152.44 A: [laughter] 

153.98 165.49 A: and now i can't even remember either of their names but i know i was hot off hot on the one and i didn't really care for the other one and the other one was the one that wanted me to dance with her [laughter] 

161.05 164.33 B: oh my gosh that's really c- well 

164.50 168.14 B: well did you finally get it sorted out did you find a woman 

167.21 172.60 A: oh yeah i mean we were all you know all through 'cause we went to the same high school together too so we were all buds [laughter] 

168.74 169.54 B: yeah 

170.48 172.33 B: yeah oh that's cool 

172.61 180.91 B: wow you know it's funny when i went to high school there was this one girl who was like more beautiful than any other and like but i i never had the guts to approach her 

180.83 190.03 B: and i ended up marrying her and she's my wife now and we're really happy yeah it's cool even though she didn't know who i was during high school which is probably for the best [laughter] 

183.47 184.94 A: oh that's way cool 

189.85 193.05 A: well how did you end up ah getting the gumption to meet her then 

192.69 200.09 B: oh my gosh well [sigh] i don't know it had been a lot of well not a lot of years since i graduated but i went off to college and you know i got a degree 

200.01 209.83 B: and i found that you know it's hard to find a decent woman to go out with and you know pretty much everybody i'd dated was a psychopath so 

208.98 209.76 A: oh 

209.77 223.21 B: but you know i graduated and then ah we were reintroduced by a mutual friend and you know we just kind of fell in love she was producing a play and i ended up being cast as the romantic lead so you can imagine how cheesy it got 

221.29 226.08 A: [laughter] okay okay [laughter] 

223.65 224.75 B: [laughter] 

224.76 233.22 B: so that's pretty cool and [noise] you know so we moved up north and got jobs there back when northern california was making lots of money 

232.93 236.38 A: yeah what would you change if you could change anything 

235.93 238.00 B: and ah oh my gosh 

238.24 246.96 B: i don't know you know i think i'd have to say that i i couldn't change anything because i couldn't possibly see what the results of the actions would be 

246.97 248.49 B: like [sigh] 

248.71 251.61 B: i don't know i mean it seems like 

251.96 256.97 B: well maybe if you could like stop someone from dying or something like that somebody important 

257.05 258.32 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

257.10 258.38 B: (( i don't know )) 

258.45 260.18 A: (( yeah )) 

259.13 267.26 B: i don't know i'd be tempted to just you know for fun go back and alter the course of world history and major events and see what happened you know 

266.28 273.65 A: yeah like i could say i would stop the guy that shot lennon you know but then um you know maybe he was gonna get cancer the next year anyway 

269.80 270.74 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

270.90 271.80 B: yeah 

273.62 275.07 B: (( right exactly )) 

273.75 276.56 A: and have a really painful death so who knows 

275.66 279.29 B: yeah yeah no kidding and like or you know what if 

277.85 283.66 A: or maybe he was secretly tired of yoko i don't know you know [laughter] [laughter] 

280.52 282.62 B: right [laughter] exactly 

282.69 287.09 B: yeah no it it's you know it's a compelling idea you know 

287.15 290.54 B: cold war would have gone on thirty more years [noise] 

290.23 292.72 A: now that's a scary thought [laughter] 

291.51 292.83 B: yeah [laughter] 

293.23 294.63 B: (( yeah i think so )) 

295.15 306.25 B: wow major historical events i wonder maybe if you could prevent the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in serbia like there would be no world war one and then no world war two 

304.66 310.80 A: na those folks had been cranky for centuries i don't think i don't think if it wasn't him somebody else would have 

307.35 308.46 B: yeah 

308.58 309.51 B: (( [cough] )) 

310.01 313.02 B: that's true there's there's always a pretext 

312.83 315.77 A: (( [laughter] )) 

314.27 320.00 B: ah i don't know it's funny like even with a time machine could you really alter world history all that much 

320.61 321.44 B: (( i don't know )) 

320.86 324.52 A: yeah like i could say i you know maybe i wanted i would want to go back and ah 

324.74 325.67 B: yeah 

324.78 328.14 A: cut jesus some slack and get you know get him off the cross 

328.15 329.40 B: yeah 

328.66 337.72 A: but but then would you know would ah would christianity have been where it is today would i have even wanted it would would maybe mohammadism would have come up instead and everybody would be allah these days 

332.38 335.16 B: well exactly that would have like foiled the whole 

337.07 344.09 B: or they would have all worshiped you because you rescued the savior [laughter] and it would have been like this weird schism in the church and oh my gosh 

339.47 353.91 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] i think i would have stuck out back then i'm i don't tan well so [laughter] 

344.62 347.45 B: [laughter] it's hard to say like you know 

348.80 349.85 B: yeah 

350.25 352.43 B: yeah i know what you mean 

352.88 355.27 B: (( well [laughter] funny idea )) 

354.77 363.08 A: well this has been one of the in- the ah more interesting subjects i guess there first i talked to to somebody i wasn't sure if the other person was a computer 

358.67 359.71 B: yeah 

363.28 375.13 A: and i don't [noise] remember the topic right now well he never really seemed to add anything he kept saying he kept saying like it could have just been a really well modulated computer voice i couldn't have i couldn't have figured out 

363.49 366.23 B: really that's interesting 

367.79 369.17 B: oh really 

373.11 376.07 B: that's ah oh that's disappointing 

375.81 389.98 A: and i've been wondering if like you know i- it's i guess it's possible if you had a really smart computer maybe i maybe i'm playing whitney with a turing program [laughter] 

381.68 382.70 B: yeah 

385.18 393.11 B: well hey exactly you know who knows what this experiment it really about they could be testing the waters so to speak 

392.72 402.75 A: they say it's voice recognition i don't know well i was thinking actually the a- after the a- this is the fourth time i've talked now and after the last one they got me to thinking i think it was friendships was the last thing we talked about 

394.37 395.48 B: yeah 

398.92 399.76 B: (( oh )) 

402.53 403.53 B: okay 

402.60 415.59 A: and it got me to thinking about my best friend who i've known since i was ten i'm in my early forties now and i was thinking if they really want to test this thing out they should get not just strangers but people that know each other very well because 

407.60 408.51 B: uh-huh 

415.52 416.84 B: yeah 

415.56 428.23 A: conversations are fairly random you know they jump quite a bit just with strangers you and i but with my buddy ed i mean we can be talking about one subject and then with just a word be on a complete tangent but we know what we're saying 

418.02 419.37 B: exactly 

420.48 421.55 B: that's true 

426.64 434.70 B: it's true yeah you have so so much vernacular and like you know common language and stuff that it would be hard for a computer to even figure it out 

434.25 435.50 A: yeah 

434.97 436.47 B: yeah that's true 

436.82 444.27 B: wow i i can't imagine that they're even close to like creating a computer that passes for a human in casual conversation though 

444.08 447.21 A: (( [sigh] ah yeah i kinda no i don't think so )) 

444.97 445.99 B: i mean 

447.12 448.14 B: really 

448.27 455.10 B: yeah it just seems like you know the the principle of how to do it isn't there the human brain is the most complex object in the universe 

455.16 456.74 A: ah i wouldn't go that far 

456.60 460.12 B: and well i mean that's what they say anyway i mean 

458.06 463.09 A: it's just a bunch of it's just a bunch of switches [laughter] 

461.24 464.47 B: but a huge number of switches [laughter] 

464.15 466.14 A: yeah well yeah 

464.74 468.60 B: so lots and lots of possibilities almost the 

467.33 475.40 A: but i mean there you know the the way computers are moving they're you know within twenty even twenty or thirty years i'm sure they're going to be able to 

470.49 471.66 B: yeah 

475.43 478.53 A: pack that much information into one box 

476.88 477.84 B: yeah 

478.25 483.91 B: well they already have that much power but it seems to be a subject of the wiring like how do you get it all to 

484.00 486.10 B: work in a spontaneous way 

486.07 498.13 A: yeah there was a david gerald science fiction writer david gerald wrote a novel called when harley was one and they built a computer that was basically as complex as a human but it was so big that he it would took him like twenty years to solve a problem 

488.66 489.89 B: mm yeah 

494.55 495.38 B: mhm 

498.16 499.99 B: (( oh my gosh )) 

498.24 503.70 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

500.21 504.83 B: [laughter] that's ridiculous [laughter] that must have been written in the fifties [laughter] in fact 

503.79 507.43 A: you know and they are running into that problem with moore you know moore's law 

506.08 506.90 B: yeah 

507.44 515.01 A: like gordon moore i think it was gordon moore and there he says they're reaching the limits i think of how just how small can you make those wires anyway 

508.30 510.50 B: yeah yeah sure 

514.49 521.98 B: yeah i mean you couldn't just keep doubling every eighteen months for ever or you'd have chips that were you know beyond astronomically powerful 

521.82 523.22 A: that would be really cool 

523.22 530.56 B: yeah i know and yet that seems to be the trend i mean it's not like processing advances going have been going down 

525.56 528.52 A: [laughter] 

531.54 533.32 B: and it's just yeah 

531.79 536.40 A: [sigh] you know i'm still trying to think of something i would do to change change the past ah 

536.00 548.52 B: yeah no it's a good idea like if there's some way you could stop the world from becoming what it is today [laughter] and you know maybe like more secure freedoms for people that weren't subject to being taken away 

548.71 556.53 A: no i think we're gonna have we're all gonna be like that for quite a while because you know us being critters we still have the alpha males and the subsidiary 

552.26 553.16 B: (( really you )) 

556.57 565.30 B: know it's true it's in human nature but there have been brief periods where people overcome that and like like early texas for example i mean 

556.64 558.95 A: the you know and the beta creatures 

559.25 560.75 A: yeah 

565.26 572.69 B: don't you do you like the prospect of texas being an independent republic and having it's own government 

565.49 567.65 A: well yeah 

571.21 573.57 A: yeah and theoretically it still can be 

573.61 574.60 B: yeah 

573.64 575.20 A: although that's not going to happen 

574.90 579.59 B: i know well if you read the constitution it should be right now but that's not going to happen either 

575.58 576.70 A: [laughter] 

577.98 580.59 A: [laughter] 

580.05 586.48 B: oh my goodness that was all dispensed with last century hm the civil war and all that 

585.83 592.33 A: well maybe i would maybe i would go back if i could see well you have to have some research done because what if there was ah 

590.64 591.44 B: (( mm )) 

592.42 599.89 A: like a a really temperate moderate really nice cro-magnon person and then a really cranky cro-magnon person but the 

598.13 599.44 B: oh yeah
