52.32 55.53 B: you know a lot of people i think would take the money and it wouldn't phase them 

52.41 53.11 A: oh 

56.01 56.84 B: now i couldn't 

57.24 60.64 A: but uh how on earth do they define what a friend is if 

61.28 62.38 B: well your best friend 

62.77 66.87 A: yeah but how if they're going to just take the money then is that person really a friend of their's 

66.84 70.01 B: yeah that w- that's not a friend and you could never speak to them again 

70.43 71.22 A: yeah 

71.26 72.36 B: no no no 

72.44 73.96 A: i can't even imagine 

75.28 75.77 B: no 

75.32 77.96 A: i wonder is this ha- is it an age related question 

78.47 81.25 A: if people of different ages might look at it differently 

81.27 82.44 B: well you know they might 

82.83 86.42 B: younger people probably they'd probably definitely take the money because they're lazy 

85.76 86.33 A: well you know 

86.63 89.49 A: yeah i wonder if you ask someone eighteen years old 

86.67 89.30 B: they don't want to work 

89.87 91.59 A: you know to them probably 

92.44 94.20 A: nothing is more important than the money 

94.31 94.62 B: yeah 

95.13 95.85 B: i'm forty 

96.28 99.58 A: well yeah i'm thirty four so 

100.43 104.85 A: a few you got a couple more than me but i'm working my way up there 

105.46 107.54 B: so we've got our ducks in a row 

107.29 108.69 A: well maybe 

107.69 109.17 B: that's way it is 

108.93 115.06 A: maybe but you know i really i think maybe that i- i- it would be different you know depending on their age 

115.41 115.93 A: maybe 

116.62 120.91 A: or maybe it depends who they consider their best friend 

120.07 127.85 B: well that's true too yeah cause some people think that their best friend is their spouse 

121.50 125.12 A: or maybe they're mad at them today or something i don't know 

127.58 128.44 A: that's true 

128.00 130.28 B: what would they do divorced them then 

130.43 133.95 B: and take their money and go 

130.45 132.08 A: i still say (( we didn't )) have a choice 

132.32 133.17 A: yeah 

133.95 137.05 A: yeah some people change their best friend every week anyway so 

136.76 137.65 B: well that's true 

137.94 139.48 A: you know i mean 

140.05 149.84 A: i kn- i kn- i know people that i went to college with that are like that yeah y- you never know who their friend is this week you know so 

144.05 144.70 B: oh really 

148.42 148.96 B: oh 

150.13 151.27 A: i guess maybe 

151.47 153.60 A: they would probably take a million dollars in a minute 

154.62 157.59 B: see i was my husband was in the army he retired from the army 

157.94 159.72 B: and moving around all them years 

160.13 164.57 B: you learn you know who your friends are and who's not your real friend i mean i still -tay stay in touch 

165.11 167.87 B: i se- i went and seen one girlfriend i hadn't seen in ten years 

168.20 168.92 A: oh wow 

168.70 171.11 B: and we talk on the phone like once or twice a year 

171.36 173.20 B: and it's like we still live next door to each other 

174.39 175.28 A: oh yeah 

174.69 176.79 B: it's like time does not go by for us 

183.43 184.92 A: -til i went to graduate school 

185.01 185.30 B: uh-huh 

185.44 187.87 A: because i'm from a family of twelve children 

187.93 191.18 B: oh my lord 

188.43 191.55 A: and i have eight sisters and they're like my best friends 

191.58 194.80 B: yeah 

191.98 200.30 A: you know i didn't really have to look outside my family for friendship-type relationships until i went away to graduate school and i wasn't close to them 

200.37 200.71 B: uh-huh 

201.42 202.50 A: so you know 

202.69 204.15 A: eh it's kind of a different 

204.25 205.66 A: thing i mean 

205.93 210.08 A: i i guess you know when i think about it it's like well 

210.50 211.48 A: it's 

212.81 215.61 A: it's different eh when you have a big family 

215.70 216.11 B: yeah 

216.50 217.00 A: you know 

217.38 220.23 A: the tendency is to be each others' friend 

220.83 224.62 A: especially with that many girls i mean you know 

222.41 227.94 B: oh yeah eight of you and three's a crowd so there was always two 

226.92 230.02 A: yeah and when i and we kind of are in age groups 

230.18 231.67 B: uh-huh 

230.20 236.18 A: i'm the youngest but there's like maybe three that are close in age and then there's another three that are close in age so 

236.31 239.00 A: you know it was always like we a- you always had somebody 

239.83 240.86 A: so 

240.98 245.75 A: i don't know you couldn't possibly take a million dollars not to speak to your sister 

244.65 247.26 B: no not at all 

246.00 252.92 A: that wouldn't work well oh anyway so i don- you know really if you think about it 

247.82 248.71 B: hm mm 

249.17 250.86 B: no 

253.19 259.97 A: now a days especially the way the economy is saying just saying the words a million dollars to a lot of people they wouldn't care what they had to do 

260.22 260.96 B: what that's true 

261.43 261.93 A: you know 

262.06 262.38 B: yeah 

262.52 263.70 A: they really wouldn't care 

262.55 273.91 B: well watch the news and you'll see it all the time the things these people do and you think it blows my mind it definitely blows my mind 

266.55 268.00 A: that's true 

268.86 270.32 A: that's true 

272.73 275.87 A: yeah i don't i don't know about that though i mean 

276.18 279.62 B: i mean i have a girl friend that just inherited three million dollars 

279.85 280.64 B: okay 

280.79 281.26 B: and 

281.53 282.69 B: that's my best friend 

282.99 284.88 B: and but her mother was my best friend 

285.14 285.90 A: oh 

286.11 286.81 B: and 

287.41 290.56 B: it is sad and i feel bad when she buys me something 

290.67 291.61 B: i don't like it 

291.93 292.51 A: yeah 

292.41 293.66 B: i mean i'd buy it for her 

294.17 294.62 A: right 

294.22 301.09 B: you know but like for mother's day i sent her flowers for mother's day and it this is the first year that her mom has been gone from us 

301.74 306.10 B: and i always like at christmas i st- or on her birthday i send her flowers and i put one rose 

306.38 307.36 B: and that's for her mom 

307.52 308.43 A: oh that's a nice 

307.85 308.43 B: to her 

308.80 311.26 B: that's sh- and she knows that's what that means that's her mommy 

308.83 309.27 A: thought 

312.24 313.63 B: and for mother's day 

313.81 315.70 B: she had told me awhile back now bee 

316.18 322.53 B: i'm buying you something and i can't wait to see your face but it's something you need and i'm thinking something i need i don't need anything 

323.14 323.59 A: huh 

323.74 327.28 B: she bought me one of them oak shiver them floor length mirrors 

327.47 328.29 A: oh 

328.06 328.98 B: i didn't have one 

329.14 330.04 A: oh 

329.46 333.89 B: and she was at my house and had tried a coat on i had bought her at christmas and she goes okay where's your mirror 

334.47 338.43 B: i didn't have a full-length mirror so bee had to have a full-length mirror 

337.98 338.82 A: oh 

338.87 340.07 B: so she bought that for me 

340.32 341.12 A: yeah 

340.84 341.44 B: but 

341.59 344.37 B: it's not changed her i mean she's still the same 

344.91 348.09 B: (( isn't )) that money has not went to her head or changed her at all 

347.27 348.43 A: oh that's kind of nice 

348.57 348.90 B: yeah 

349.85 357.32 A: but yet she you know at least in her situation she didn't have to do anything illegal or give up anything to get it i mean 

352.14 361.43 B: no i mean she's still working she's a nurse and she still goes to work everyday and you know 

362.55 362.95 A: yeah 

363.15 363.82 B: so 

364.08 364.71 A: yeah but 

364.51 365.79 B: but she even told me if 

366.18 368.07 B: she because her her money's in a trust 

368.60 370.78 B: if she could get to it she would give it away 

371.20 373.83 B: she'd give it to her kids because her daughter's such a witch 

371.36 371.73 A: ah 

374.22 374.79 A: oh 

374.25 374.88 B: she is 

375.55 376.79 B: her daughter's just greedy 

375.61 376.02 A: huh 

377.40 377.71 A: huh 

377.77 381.14 B: and she would she would give it to her just maybe try to buy her love 

381.22 381.88 A: oh 

382.00 385.80 B: because it's one day she loves her mom and the next day she hates her mom 

385.08 387.19 A: that probably wouldn't work 

386.18 387.35 B: yeah 

387.99 391.37 B: so it's just one of them situations and i feel sorry for her you know 

391.52 392.50 A: yeah well 

392.37 396.59 B: but her daughter doesn't like her being friends with me she don't want her mom to have a girl friend 

397.17 397.58 A: now that's 

397.26 398.07 B: she never has 

397.76 398.18 A: dumb 

398.51 398.82 B: yeah 

399.63 402.91 B: but i tell her that's because she's just immature and she's just a spoiled brat 

401.91 402.24 A: well 

403.46 405.54 A: that that could be it 

404.72 407.14 B: you know it's just a (( pack )) 

406.35 410.27 A: uh-huh well i think that's what it is about you know 

410.87 415.50 A: younger people why i say they might take a million dollars because it's a maturity issue 

415.66 415.98 B: yeah 

416.41 418.49 A: you know they don't ha- they don't 

418.63 420.54 A: plus i'm not sure that like 

420.89 424.42 A: kids that are like in high school now i'd i'm not sure how much 

425.23 429.69 A: they've really been taught or how much they really developed in terms of things like loyalty and 

430.26 431.19 A: you know what i mean 

430.40 430.76 B: right 

431.46 435.89 A: they're different they have different approaches to life than what even kids my age do 

436.33 436.73 B: i'd like 

436.83 440.98 B: to see them take a survey about god i don't think this younger generation knows god at all 

441.50 447.56 A: i don't know abou- i don't really you know i have a niece that's graduating from high school but other than that i don't really 

442.06 444.88 B: since it's out of school 

448.24 452.94 A: can yo- see there shows you how big my family is i'm thirty four and my niece is graduating from high school 

453.59 457.51 A: i ha- in fact i have great nieces 

457.29 464.51 B: oh my 

457.89 465.42 A: but anyway you know i i other than that i don't really know any kids that age but i just get the sense that they 

467.16 469.44 A: are n- uh just really you know 

469.98 470.45 A: aren't 

471.94 472.66 A: i don't know is 

473.08 477.82 A: into things like friendship and loyalty and that stuff it's all for me and it's all for right now 

477.74 478.03 B: yeah 

478.62 479.07 A: you know 

478.76 481.11 B: because that younger and that's how it is with them with working 

481.32 482.70 B: they want to g- they want the paycheck 

482.79 483.74 B: but they don't want to do their work 

483.95 485.20 A: boy isn't that the truth 

485.17 487.07 B: uh-huh 

485.77 489.06 A: yeah i can attest to that one 

487.29 491.54 B: and it's aggravating this younger generation 

491.83 492.17 A: yup 

492.45 497.19 B: and it's sad and the last generation it seems like they're smart but they don't have common sense 

497.23 497.79 A: right 

498.36 499.83 B: so i don't know what's going on 

500.23 504.93 A: right that's true but you know and also i think to to like an 

505.34 508.95 A: eighteen year old or a twenty year old or whatever a million dollars 

509.28 513.52 A: probably seems like a whole lot more money than it does to someone my age or your age 

513.62 513.93 B: yeah 

514.29 515.21 B: i'm sure it is 

515.60 516.43 B: in their eyes 

515.94 516.42 A: so 

517.15 518.69 A: there'd be more of that tendency of 

518.84 521.05 A: not having to care what y- they had to do to get it 

521.76 522.18 A: you know 

522.33 523.41 A: because 

523.69 524.21 A: i mean 

524.83 528.37 A: even at my age i realize that a million dollars doesn't go very far 

529.14 529.70 A: you know 

530.23 531.61 B: boy you could blow it real quick 

531.74 533.42 A: oh yeah but i don't think 

533.86 536.24 A: a lot of younger people would realize that 

537.59 538.18 A: so 

537.76 539.36 B: they would think it'd last them a lifetime 

540.45 544.78 A: yeah i think they probably would think that you know because they don't have anything to relate it to 

546.44 546.89 A: so 

546.46 551.53 B: they don't live in a home like we do and pay the taxes and insurance and everything and know what things cost 

551.63 552.42 A: that's right 

551.99 553.81 B: you know like my mom has always said 

554.16 559.03 B: we'd be rich if it wasn't for having to eat and it's true (( grow )) the grocery st- 

556.80 558.13 A: i say that too 

559.14 561.62 B: -ore and lord you know it's 

560.25 561.78 A: oh i hate that 

562.09 564.17 B: but it's the truth 

562.21 565.05 A: i wonder if this million dollars is tax-free
