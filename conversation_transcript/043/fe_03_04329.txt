206.06 211.59 A: even though it came even though with the results may have been in present you 

211.65 216.25 A: you wouldn't want to change it because maybe you learned something from it or

373.15 374.38 B: oh is that right 

378.75 387.44 A: ah i'm still it's an ongoing thing ah probably when i'm in my sixties i'll still be [laughter] going to school because you can never get too much education 

387.18 388.98 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

389.30 392.63 B: (( i think everybody tries to get it in their education )) 

389.44 390.45 A: so 

392.44 394.81 A: (( [laughter] wh- )) 

396.42 401.81 A: so what what would you would you change anything else or would you do more things 

402.45 406.57 B: not really i there's not too much that i'd change um 

406.12 406.70 A: (( hm )) 

407.11 411.54 B: other than i wish i hadn't been so damned 

411.82 417.27 B: bull headed when i was in under- when i was my when i first went to college 

417.57 418.99 A: oh really 

418.41 419.66 B: yeah 

419.16 422.46 A: that's when you said you became a son of a bitch 

422.27 423.17 B: (( [laughter] )) 

422.95 424.87 A: [laughter] 

424.15 425.22 B: yeah 

425.53 428.07 B: but i learned from that too ah 

428.09 429.18 A: uh-huh 

428.74 430.09 B: yeah 

429.73 434.32 A: well you know what it doesn't hurt to have that kind of spirit i mean 

434.48 435.77 B: what do you mean 

434.72 435.62 A: i try 

435.76 440.10 A: i try not to break my kids' spirits sometimes they're very 

440.17 445.53 A: stubborn sometimes they're very um demanding or ornery and 

445.74 451.18 A: as long as they don't disrespect me i i'm okay with it because sometimes 

451.43 453.38 A: if if um 

454.56 463.46 A: sometimes if you go through life afraid or quiet or meek you don't really live life so sometimes you have to be 

463.47 465.93 A: stubborn and bull headed and 

463.90 465.21 B: [noise] 

466.03 470.76 A: and and try and get your way i mean you can't be that way all the time 

471.04 473.09 A: but sometimes you have to be 

473.61 478.26 B: i don't know you have to live your life with a purpose i think 

474.72 475.62 A: [laughter] 

477.67 478.93 A: yeah 

479.63 487.52 B: you have to have a purpose for your life but then to be cocky and bull headed that's not good 

486.56 493.91 A: [laughter] but you don't want to live under somebody's thumb either the other the other side of that is 

491.49 492.58 B: yeah 

494.02 499.73 A: to be under somebody's foot or to be under somebody's th- thumb so i guess there's a medium 

500.30 501.58 B: that's true 

501.52 505.99 A: and that that would be cool if you could have some kind of magic travel 

506.07 510.33 A: time machine to take you back since you've already lived it and you know 

510.56 514.18 A: the results you know what doesn't work 

513.97 515.52 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

515.00 517.49 A: then you could try another approach 

517.09 518.90 B: yeah 

519.99 521.54 B: are you married now 

521.71 522.79 A: um 

523.02 529.93 A: i i'm not married now but i'm in a committed relationship i'm living with 

530.27 534.58 A: um a man that i've been dating for quite a long time 

534.43 535.31 B: huh 

534.88 541.27 A: and we probably will get married we were just we haven't really made the plans this year 

542.10 548.13 A: but they're it looks like there's a a good future for us 'cause we're we're very close and happy 

542.13 543.22 B: oh 

547.83 549.79 B: (( good )) 

551.48 558.80 A: but that's one of the things i when i do reflect back on my life and think well if i could change something 

559.01 569.75 A: what would i change i think that i wouldn't change it because all the experiences i've had whether they were really bad or or [lipsmack] horrible i 

569.73 576.41 A: i look at that and say well i went through that for a reason so that when something really good does happen to me 

576.45 578.49 A: i can recognize it so 

579.68 584.55 A: i mean it at anything in in jobs in relationships 

579.73 580.98 B: yeah 

584.62 589.71 A: in in financial matters if something really bad happened to me 

590.33 595.65 A: then at least when something good does happen i will see it and i will recognize it 

595.24 597.06 B: yeah 

596.71 597.85 A: so 

599.31 599.89 A: (( i do )) 

599.34 599.89 B: (( that's ))
