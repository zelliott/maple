4.35 5.42 B: i'm jen 

5.68 7.37 A: i'm from minnesota yeah 

8.00 10.30 B: oh are you i'm from connecticut 

9.75 14.54 A: connecticut the last person i talked to was from oden long island so 

10.85 12.03 B: yeah 

14.53 15.60 B: really 

14.55 19.94 A: i'm getting the east coast people here well it makes sense since it's a pennsylvania study [laughter] 

16.74 17.55 B: [laughter] 

19.28 20.63 B: yeah true 

20.72 25.20 B: [laughter] so what was the topic i missed out on it during the 

23.52 35.68 A: oh my goodness they they certainly like have jumped from being pretty superficial to like deep now if you could change one thing in your life what would it be [laughter] if you could go back [laughter] 

34.22 35.10 B: i know 

35.54 38.17 B: (( [laughter] )) 

38.40 40.24 B: (( i don't think i'd change anything )) 

40.16 41.42 A: (( really that's )) 

41.01 43.14 B: i'm one of those people who um 

43.44 51.87 B: like i i'm twenty two and i'm not you know i haven't experienced a lot but i'd have to say i don't regret one thing ever i've done like 

51.37 52.47 A: that's cool 

52.39 53.44 B: yeah 

53.26 54.26 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

53.53 55.30 B: because i feel like it's made 

55.60 64.37 B: me a better it's made me who i am today so if i were to go back and change something i think i wouldn't be where i am now and i'm happy with what i am and where i am now so 

64.39 75.31 A: that's good because then then i think you have that that sort of tells me that you're an optimist and um try to take positive things out of your life situations even hardships 

75.58 76.42 B: yeah 

75.75 77.28 A: (( that's good [laughter] )) 

76.92 79.78 B: like even if people try and get mad at me i can never 

79.83 87.39 B: i never am like mad at them i i'm the kind of person i will kill them with kindness and that makes them more mad you know it's like 

85.85 87.21 A: [laughter] 

88.26 91.09 B: i love doing that to people [laughter] 

89.64 93.62 A: yeah [laughter] darn i couldn't get her

93.71 94.92 B: [laughter] 

95.47 96.66 B: [laughter] 

96.86 101.51 A: oh well my my one regret that i have is that um 

102.03 104.83 A: that i didn't go to college and 

104.12 105.29 B: oh really 

104.85 112.08 A: actually that's i i just signed up to i'm a freshman starting this summer so and i'm thirty thirty years old so 

109.67 111.57 B: oh well congratulations 

112.35 115.42 A: yeah it was i um [lipsmack] it was 

115.43 122.42 A: the one regret i had in life and i decided why n- why have regrets and i can't go back in time and change it 

119.24 120.60 B: mhm 

122.46 124.03 A: but i can certainly 

124.05 127.37 A: you know make it better and and you know 

127.58 129.35 A: work to you know 

129.55 135.78 A: i mean like you i try and like think well there are so many good things that that happened because i didn't i mean 

135.45 136.18 B: hm 

136.04 138.45 A: the time that i would have been in school 

138.50 149.59 A: i traveled all over the country and i was married and i but i married at a young age and i'm real happy with what i you know the fact that i got to do that but 

148.72 149.45 B: hm 

149.75 155.59 A: [sigh] you know that's so you know really i i don't think you should live with any regrets in your life 

155.60 166.31 B: no and like i've been blessed too where i was like i'm in college i'm graduating like this year and everything and there's really like i've had every opportunity that's been given to me like i haven't ever 

166.49 170.81 B: not been able to do something like no matter what my parents always try to you know 

171.04 181.29 B: give me what they could just so i they could say i had anything so that's probably part of the reason why i don't regret anything because i've never missed out on anything in order to regret something 

172.82 174.04 A: right right 

180.96 186.11 A: right right yeah that's something my husband and i we have ah a one and a two year old 

186.10 197.43 A: and um that's something that's really important to us and i told my husband i said well it taught me one thing is that my children will go to school my my family wouldn't even attend like my high school graduation 

197.22 198.34 B: oh wow 

198.06 203.63 A: because they didn't see the importance of it and so 

201.79 202.80 B: mhm 

203.85 218.52 A: it sort of was like the opposite in my house and so i didn't see the importance of it even though i was you know national honors society a plus student i just didn't you know i didn't see the point in doing something that my parents didn't see was necessary and 

212.31 213.05 B: hm 

218.57 219.38 B: (( [mn] )) 

219.67 222.39 A: stupid but oh well [laughter] 

223.02 228.28 A: so yeah that's like for for us my husband and i it's really important that our children do go to school mhm 

228.40 229.87 B: yeah and i love um 

230.14 238.12 B: actually like how old have old people are always like you know they're eighty and like i never regret one thing i've ever done in my life and i love that i want to 

238.27 245.70 B: be able to like i'm sure they've said it at one point in their life too but when they look back at it in the long run i think they realize that everything was 

246.17 249.17 B: what that made them today you know it's like 

247.86 252.93 A: right right yep exactly and then you can always like look at it and say 

253.01 254.86 A: you know even if you have like 

254.87 266.10 A: there's been like hardships that my husband and i have gone through and i don't regret those i mean that's that's like i think there's a difference between like regretting something and learning from it like 

265.39 266.98 B: right exactly 

266.49 274.16 A: yeah because i don't regret like the things the things that i've done mistakes i made because i learned from it it made me a more humble person 

273.92 274.87 B: right 

274.18 279.98 A: i used to be really judgmental and i went through some hardships myself and i was on the other end [laughter] 

279.92 281.02 B: mhm 

280.72 284.12 A: so it made me more of a person who was like more 

284.43 287.79 A: open and understanding to other situations 

286.64 287.46 B: right 

288.64 300.19 B: and all that's i agree too like anything that does happen you learn from it and you just either don't experience it ever again or you learn to change like if you're ever faced with it again you learn to handle it better 

292.76 293.73 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

299.88 305.63 A: right right yeah but i really do think that it has to do with the person's um 

300.46 301.23 B: (( you know )) 

305.64 306.87 B: oh yes 

306.12 307.44 A: disposition 

307.47 312.63 B: mhm oh yeah there's some people that it wouldn't even be able to handle it and you know you know they'd just be like 

307.67 310.36 A: because you can talk to some yeah 

310.94 312.63 A: right right 

313.02 323.06 A: and they're mired in their own self pity over you know things and that doesn't do you any good it just stalls you out and you don't move forward you just look back 

322.86 332.48 B: yeah and that's a lot of especially a lot of people in college are like that too they're just like oh they're just stuck and they don't want to change and it's like you really kind of have to [laughter] you 

332.17 333.76 A: yeah exactly 

332.67 336.75 B: just can't keep being doing what you're doing because you're going to go nowhere like 

336.37 339.62 A: right right [sigh] yeah 

340.31 341.97 A: [laughter] that's so true 

342.67 344.20 A: yeah there is um 

345.00 346.26 A: there is a 

346.92 357.49 A: i watch oprah once in a while and there was there was something on recently about that about living your life but you know she's real into that about living your life to the fullest and 

348.57 349.55 B: mhm 

355.81 356.55 B: hm 

357.48 363.02 A: and stuff and there was people on there that like were telling things that they wished they could have done 

363.25 368.15 A: and stuff and she helped them make those things come true there were 

367.15 370.12 B: well i want to be on a show like that [laughter] 

368.78 376.01 A: [laughter] she's so giving but she helped them like you know things that were sometimes really really small things 

375.85 376.88 B: mhm 

376.17 380.55 A: like you know quite you know maybe seeing somebody or 

380.64 390.15 A: like one one guy wanted to date someone he'd he hadn't asked this girl to date he was in high school with and he wanted to go back and ask her to date him
