10.48 16.71 B: good would you like to start i'm sitting here grading papers so if you'd like to go ahead and start 

14.03 15.41 A: (( oh okay )) 

16.04 22.31 A: i was just doing they said the hypothetical situation where if you could go back in time and change something what would be 

21.94 22.78 B: uh-huh 

22.34 24.35 A: oh my god i don't know 

23.89 30.31 B: i know i was kind of um stumped i think if we could change something in our life is that what it was 

29.66 30.68 A: uh-huh 

30.41 33.57 B: change something in our life what would it be 

33.73 37.67 B: oh gosh that would be that's kind of hard for me 

37.71 41.50 B: because what would i change in my life 

41.63 42.41 B: oh 

42.58 46.39 B: (( ah gosh [laughter] i don't know that's t- )) 

45.27 48.21 A: that that's a really hard one because if you change any 

46.75 53.23 B: i that would be really hard you know if i could something ah you you know different things um 

48.22 49.88 A: yeah that's 

53.81 63.79 B: you know um i'm very secure in my marriage i wouldn't change my marriage for the world but the only thing i didn't find my husband until i was like in my thirties 

58.86 60.07 A: (( mhm )) 

63.33 65.88 A: oh well good that's confirmation for me 

65.50 73.86 B: oh is it right well well well i got married the first time ah when i was in college and it did not last so 

73.05 74.01 A: uh-huh 

73.82 88.59 B: um i would say the thing i would change is i not making ah stupid decisions like when you're young like i was in college ah and but say i didn't even become a mother until i was forty one years old 

79.85 81.89 A: mhm yeah 

82.07 83.02 A: right 

87.86 89.19 A: really 

88.63 91.87 B: yeah i've got a daughter that's in just nine years old now 

91.43 93.89 A: (( wow )) 

92.02 106.30 B: i was forty one yeah and i wouldn't change that for the world i'd probably say the only thing i would change was but it didn't happen that way is that i would love to have had four or five kids but you know sometimes you don't get what you want 

103.33 104.87 A: oh okay 

105.57 108.99 A: right right well i think you always get what you need though 

106.78 107.72 B: and 

108.49 114.26 B: i think you get what you need and stuff but then i ah teach school so i have children at school so 

109.69 111.43 A: (( mhm oh )) 

113.91 115.18 A: okay 

114.52 118.67 B: i've got those but i don't know really what what would you change in your life 

117.72 119.02 A: (( i think the one )) 

119.08 133.97 A: the one thing that i would change is i would have completed college because i didn't complete um my degree so i think that yeah you can always go back but i would have i think that for for years there was a big void for me there was that 

125.11 127.06 B: oh you can always go back 

133.87 142.84 A: whole sense of accomplishment or aco- achieving something even though i bought a house and i had a great great career and 

138.60 140.15 B: yeah well i'm 

141.79 154.63 B: yeah and well see i was probably like you i didn't finish and then i had i waited several years before i went back and still i would like to go back and even get more education now 

148.80 150.09 A: mhm 

154.19 155.37 A: right 

154.52 167.66 B: i would love to go back one day and it may even be after i retire but i'd like to go back and get my masters but it will probably be after i retire because i didn't think when i was younger that it was you know important 

160.32 161.69 A: mhm 

166.78 169.13 A: right right and 

167.54 171.56 B: i guess i was more interested i think i was more interested in other things 

171.41 181.93 A: i think i'll i'll be a better student once i do because you well you when you're an adult you go to school for different reasons than fresh out of high school i mean it's you know you have things in perspective you really know what you want to do 

176.74 177.88 B: yes you do 

181.56 186.95 B: oh well the well first time i was in college i have to admit i did not know what i wanted 

186.27 187.37 A: uh-huh 

186.96 189.14 B: i was just there to have a good time 

188.56 197.05 A: an- and i i thought that i wanted the same things my parents wanted for me but then after i got two years into it i was like this is not what i want to do 

197.07 208.28 A: and it so going back to complete it which i am going to do is going to be a totally different situation you know i know exactly what i'm there for and i won't be wasting any money [laughter] any time and 

206.41 207.98 B: yeah i know 

208.15 218.20 B: i would say probably one thing i regret not doing is maybe i love working with children love teaching but i think i would like to do something more so that can help people 

217.83 219.11 A: mhm 

218.07 228.03 B: ah help children in some way i don't know maybe in social services i don't really know um because ah i'd like to get you know do something that i could 

227.94 236.70 B: i don't know i just feel sometime i see children that need so much extra help and there's just you know n- not enough you can do 

232.56 233.82 A: mhm 

236.54 251.29 A: and that's the field that i work in now and you're absolutely right there's not enough work you can do it's all there's always something else sometimes you can become overwhelmed with it so you have to find that one something you know make that your calling as i learned that quickly [laughter] 

245.07 246.08 B: (( yes )) 

249.88 250.70 B: (( yeah )) 

250.73 263.55 B: i well i guess something i'm trying to say i'd like to do something ah i regret what i would like to have gotten into something that i could have helped people more in other words i guess that's a lot of people like to do that too 

259.14 260.23 A: (( mhm )) 

260.58 262.34 A: mhm 

263.05 264.80 A: mhm 

263.40 268.24 B: we see so many things that's going on that we'd like to help people 

267.90 269.25 A: mhm 

268.41 273.51 B: and stuff um i'd like for people to be do something with people be kinder toward each other 

273.05 273.71 A: yeah 

273.46 278.89 B: and schools and stuff i see it all the time but i'm a very hands on ah person and ah 

273.98 275.54 A: (( tell me about it )) 

278.37 279.62 A: mhm 

278.85 283.45 B: i do a lot of hugs to the children and i'm in elementary school so i can do that 

282.11 282.81 A: (( mm )) 

282.88 283.96 A: right 

283.34 293.97 B: and i like to give a lot of attention to the children and i would like sometime to be able to give a little more you have so many students and you don't have enough time to give to each one of them 

293.50 294.53 A: right 

294.24 303.05 B: i guess that's the thing i regret i would like to have gotten into something i could have changed if i could go back and change something that i could work more closer 

302.98 309.69 B: to m- you know i could see a difference because you have them for nine months and they move on and you don't know what happens to them 

305.38 306.58 A: mhm 

308.15 318.82 A: right exactly i i wish that i i think one other thing that i probably would have changed is i wish that i knew exactly what my passions were when i was younger you 

318.05 319.85 B: yeah 

318.93 323.34 A: know you don't you kind of don't figure those things out until later on [laughter] 

321.02 322.47 B: (( oh )) 

322.68 327.81 B: no no because i didn't start teaching myself until um five years ago 

327.27 328.62 A: mhm 

328.00 329.30 B: ah i was 

329.19 335.78 B: for years i was in private industry and just totally you know was not and then 

335.61 347.14 B: you know i've been what was it five years ago i started teaching and i really love it you know i love the kids and i never really thought i would you know really enjoy it as much as i do 

340.89 342.14 A: wow 

347.06 348.12 A: (( yeah )) 

347.46 354.14 B: so i guess you know i regret if i could change anything i i r- i wish i had started teaching earlier 

354.23 354.79 A: (( mm )) 

354.64 369.22 A: yeah honestly though i think that if if there was a possibility that you know i was given one opportunity to change one thing i don't think i would want to because i think that everything that's happened has made me the person that i am today and if any yeah 

367.21 369.77 B: and things happen for a reason right 

369.04 377.59 A: yeah and if only one thing would change then i wouldn't be who i am today and i i i i am so happy with me 

376.62 379.60 B: well you sound like a wonderful young lady 

377.89 380.80 A: [laughter] well thank you [laughter] 

379.91 383.23 B: you do you sound like a wonderful young lady 

382.77 384.04 A: (( thank you )) 

383.66 392.07 B: and kim i'm sure your parents are probably ha- but if you haven't found that right man yet don't worry about that it will come it will happen 

391.61 398.08 A: (( yeah it's ha [laughter] just one of those things where you like okay )) 

397.89 409.21 B: [laughter] well i'm so glad you did not say one of the things i'm glad you didn't say oh if i could change things i would have changed i would have you know wish i could have married so and so i'm glad you didn't say that 

407.51 408.47 A: oh 

408.27 423.13 A: god no i don't i couldn't for all the things that i've learned and looking back on my life i couldn't see myself married before now because i've learned so much on my own i think it's important that you learn who you are before you try and give yourself to somebody else 

422.11 425.73 B: oh i know it i agree with you a hundred percent 

424.94 431.05 A: mhm and i just couldn't imagine i would be trying to figure out way too much stuff that i 

431.28 433.81 A: am glad that i know [laughter] you know 

433.47 438.53 B: right i agree with you a hundred percent you've got to learn your own self first 

437.56 447.97 A: yeah you have to that that's so important and and the things i wouldn't aside from using my father as a as a model outside that i wouldn't know what i needed in a man 

447.57 457.72 B: and you have to be happy first yourself or you can be you can make someone else you know you can't you you've got to be happy first someone else cannot make you happy 

449.15 450.89 A: mhm 

454.72 455.82 A: right 

457.05 461.73 A: nh-nh they can only add to it or take away from it but they cannot make it for you 

458.61 459.65 B: yeah 

460.76 463.31 B: you've got to make your own self happy 

462.58 464.51 A: mhm 

463.82 468.44 B: and stuff that you decide but that is a hard question tonight this is 

467.53 476.70 A: that's a really hard one because i know i i think of the of all the things i i beat myself up about the most it's probably not having completed my degree 

473.52 474.47 B: yeah 

476.55 485.56 A: and it's it's funny it doesn't matter what amount of success you have if that's something that you really want to do that feeling never really goes away that you didn't 

484.43 499.26 B: um i'm the say way i would love to go back and get my masters degree one day and i know i'm not going to be able to until ah probably until i retire but i think i'm i'm going to do it then i because it's just something that i want to be able to do 

487.71 489.01 A: mhm 

495.13 496.30 A: mhm 

498.14 499.27 A: (( right you )) 

499.25 500.21 B: and ah 

500.40 509.87 B: and i guess one thing i guess i regret i wish i had of done i wish i had of ah learned spanish in high school [laughter] i wish i'd learned spanish 

507.63 518.39 A: know and i tell you i- i wish i had known the importance of it then too because i was i was fluent and just took it all for granted you know i only did it when i was 

516.42 517.21 B: oh 

518.98 519.93 A: had to 

519.64 520.64 B: yeah 

520.01 521.90 A: (( but i decided that )) 

521.92 523.50 B: i wish i had learned 

522.27 534.98 A: i just i just never use it and i um know of course wish that i had maintained it some things some things i can recognize but it's hard if you don't use it that's one thing you do lose 

532.56 545.96 B: oh i do not know any spanish i keep saying this summer i'm going to learn some spanish because i had a little boy in my class this year that did not speak english and i've had a terrible time trying to communicate with him 

540.77 541.87 A: mhm 

542.49 544.19 A: oh 

545.77 560.36 B: now thank goodness he's smarter than i am and i guess he's younger but he's picked up english a lot quicker than i have picked up his spanish but i regret not learning spanish years ago 

554.29 555.56 A: mhm 

559.82 561.27 A: mhm 

560.64 573.11 B: i regret that ah but i have should have learned it and i regret that now so i guess i would change that i think one thing i would do is i i'd probably want to learn at least spanish and maybe some more languages too 

572.05 573.34 A: mhm 

573.25 575.30 B: but you never think you're going to use them 

575.15 586.05 A: yeah exactly because if you don't use them you will lose them you d- you definitely like i again i can pick up certain things there's certain things um i you know come back to you quickly but then 

585.98 592.47 A: because they speak so quickly you know if you're not up to power in it you definitely won't pick up on it 

591.85 593.58 B: that's true and everything 

592.48 594.76 A: you won't recall it that quickly 

594.14 599.89 B: and if you live here in georgia you'll realize that we have so many people that are spanish people 

597.63 599.89 A: mhm
