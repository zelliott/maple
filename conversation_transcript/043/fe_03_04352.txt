0.00 1.43 A: hi i'm wayne 

1.08 2.74 B: hi i'm larry 

2.28 3.33 A: hi larry 

3.03 4.10 B: (( nice to meet you )) 

4.04 7.75 A: good good and our our topic today is to 

8.15 12.67 A: if we were given a million dollars so do we not speak to our best anymore 

13.98 16.27 B: mm um have you ever done this before 

16.20 18.87 A: no this is actually my first time 

18.30 20.30 B: hm okay so they um 

20.50 23.86 B: they just call the phone just c- ah rang and just called you 

23.46 24.41 A: yes 

24.31 26.01 B: and then you just picked up 

25.42 26.40 A: yes 

26.30 32.34 B: hm okay 'cause i'd i ah i i was probably i was interested in this initiating my own call and seeing what happens 

32.33 33.35 A: (( oh )) 

33.17 34.46 B: so i just called in 

33.42 43.77 A: i think what happens is you when you call them [lipsmack] that it gives us it hooks us up i d- i really don't believe that you get to choose your own topic do you 

43.73 50.01 B: no i didn't get to choose the topic but i just called in and said okay i want to do it with i have time right now so why don't we just do it right now 

49.85 50.86 A: oh cool 

50.58 51.77 B: yeah 

51.39 55.09 A: so all we need to do is discuss our topic for ten minutes 

55.02 56.05 B: hm okay 

55.67 57.58 A: and i believe they record us 

57.75 60.17 B: and then that's at the end of ten minutes they'll say it's done 

59.82 63.77 A: yes i think it's a study on human communication to be quite honest with you 

63.59 64.43 B: okay 

64.44 66.20 B: can i ask how you heard of this thing 

65.97 68.09 A: ah a friend of mine referred me 

67.87 68.88 B: hm okay 

69.59 72.28 B: yeah 'cause i i just saw this on the internet and ah 

72.41 77.98 B: i i i mean all i know it's from u. penn so i'd no idea what this thing what this is about or anything 

77.16 79.95 A: yeah actually it's kind of odd because you 

80.41 81.33 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

81.57 84.91 A: i- i- ah the friend that refers me will get paid for my phone calls 

85.21 86.25 B: (( um [laughter] mm )) 

85.64 88.60 A: and then when you refer someone they'll get paid for yours 

89.49 95.76 A: so let's discuss our topic so we don't [laughter] screw our friends out of money but um our ah 

91.76 92.99 B: yeah 

95.06 95.63 B: (( [cough] )) 

96.33 96.89 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

97.03 103.66 A: so the question is is would you give up take the million bucks never speaking to your best friend again 

103.72 112.09 A: and i i personally would not because i think that just knowing my best friend has brought me more than a million bucks 

112.12 121.65 A: thus far in life and you know not he hasn't given me a million bucks but ah the value of his friendship is way more than a million bucks to me 

121.79 122.76 A: (( um )) 

123.32 127.15 A: what is your opinion would you give it up would you take the million bucks 

127.10 134.33 B: i- i when i when i heard that that was i was kind of confused and that so you can't ever speak to your friend again so is it but i mean 

133.92 137.68 A: that's the stipulation of receiving the million dollars 

137.56 139.69 B: okay and so i mean 

139.86 144.82 B: i i guess i mean to me hypothetically like that seems impossible i mean how 

144.83 150.41 B: how do you is it on your part that you choose not like if your friend best friend called you up 

149.60 155.51 A: well it is it is a hypothetical it's it's they ask they tell you s- um 

156.36 160.26 A: i i forget exactly how it's worded but it's on your on your honor 

160.34 164.66 A: you know if you were given a million bucks you would not speak to your friend again 

166.22 167.36 B: (( mm hm um )) 

167.87 168.93 B: when i mean 

169.38 181.96 B: i have a [noise] when i when i heard about that i was like well i mean i have a lot of best friends so i'm not really sure if i just chose one so in in a sense when i heard i was like hm well maybe i can somehow find a way to make this possible 

182.09 182.74 A: (( yeah )) 

182.39 185.69 B: then i could get i can i can win both i could win both ways 

185.19 193.04 A: ha maybe if your best [laughter] your best friend was the person that left you the million bucks it would be the only pay way that would work out 

190.25 191.78 B: [laughter] 

192.14 194.32 B: [laughter] no no more in the sense that 

193.82 194.64 A: [cough] 

194.62 197.72 B: this ah this friendship was dying anyways 

197.88 200.68 B: and it it was just not worth it anymore 

200.64 204.41 A: yeah but would you have still valued that as your best friend 

204.13 217.76 B: well then i'd i probably in that sense you would that wouldn't be your best friend anymore but in some sense you the person is your best friend still and you no longer are friends with them anymore or like your the relationship is somewhat dying 

218.04 228.22 B: and for a million dollars i mean that's you know like you can go both ways but i don't know i don't know what their what their what the question really i- really means or what they're really getting at but mhm 

227.48 240.29 A: mhm see i think that might be part of the study also it's how we each individual would look at the question 'cause a male and a female would both differently look at the question and the wording and it's the subtlety in wording of a question 

240.45 241.40 A: um 

241.47 251.95 A: ah see my my interpretation i'll give you mine say my interpretation would be my best friend would be the most valued friendship i have and um 

251.97 255.34 A: that would you know a lot of people's best friends may be their parents 

255.44 259.77 A: maybe their siblings maybe just someone they've met through life or their spouse 

259.93 260.85 A: um 

261.10 263.08 A: [lipsmack] and i i don't think they 

263.16 271.79 A: i- i don't think like what on your example like you you rationalized your best friend and your relationship was dying why not take the million dollars 

271.88 277.63 A: or e- even if your best friend that you knew had had a terminal illness and was going to die in a year anyhow 

277.75 279.76 A: would you take the million dollars 

279.80 286.77 A: i i i personally i ah and another opinion of mine is is a million dollars is no longer a lot of money 

286.92 298.84 A: you know like a million dollars if you're given a million dollars at eighteen years old you would more than likely have to you know work at some other point in life you'd never be able to live off that million dollars 

298.64 302.66 A: as opposed to fifty years ago if you were given a million dollars 

302.72 308.79 A: you were set for life and your children would be set up for the start of their lives 

308.91 312.64 A: but nowadays a million dollars is not a lot of money you can buy 

313.28 320.93 A: for a million bucks you can buy a really nice home and a few nice cars and start a family and have a nice nest nest egg 

320.98 328.99 A: but that's about it um a million dollars isn't gonna really set you off from anybody else now if it were a billion dollars 

328.82 329.85 B: (( no it's not right )) 

329.25 331.97 A: you know that's a completely different situation 

331.68 332.83 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

332.32 336.48 A: you know the- then then it would may start to like tear at your 

336.63 338.84 A: friendship a bit 

339.08 340.62 B: right you mean 

341.20 345.68 B: if you mean if they give you a million but you mean you have to break up the relationship either way 

345.46 353.84 A: yeah yeah it's just that it's a hypothetical say that like you know you were given a million dollars and then you two were isolated for the rest of your lives 

354.21 356.48 A: you know you wouldn't really have an option 

356.80 367.23 A: but then again if with a million bucks you could also have all the great memories of you and your best friend and pick yourself a new best friend [laughter] 

364.22 365.72 B: (( it seems [laughter] )) 

365.88 367.44 B: right right 

367.15 372.59 A: or take say no to the million bucks and take a very wealthy best friend 

372.43 384.04 B: [laughter] right right my yeah when i heard when i heard this i was like my i guess my immediate re- quest- my immediate response was what what are they trying to get at what's the point of this question 

384.07 384.92 A: i think 

384.10 385.04 B: um 

385.07 387.05 B: what w- h- how 

387.11 395.39 B: wh- what i- what do they want people's initial responses to be and then what are the um solutions i guess or what are the ah 

387.27 387.85 A: (( [cough] )) 

395.61 403.08 B: what are the what are the c- what are the possible permutations of the situation so a person could have um the best the best of both worlds yeah 

402.63 412.49 A: see i i kinda think that the the question was wh- i think the questions are worded kinda like you're language questions on an s._a._t. test to where depending on h- 

412.65 421.19 A: which view or w- what inflection you put on that particular sentence gives each word a different or more valued meaning 

423.56 426.91 A: so so i think that i think the question is to be 

427.10 429.44 A: kind of non answerable 

429.80 438.55 A: you know it's just to be an opinionated question and i think that like our sex has to do with it our age brackets our 

438.76 441.27 A: socioeconomical brackets 

440.75 442.32 B: (( mm right )) 

442.09 442.91 A: (( [cough] )) 

442.38 452.40 B: like like you were saying before like if um if there were two females speaking on the conversation you you said that they would look at look at it differently than two males or 

447.51 448.23 A: [cough] 

451.74 455.08 A: yeah so they would look at the verbal question differently [noise] 

455.21 457.19 B: how would they do that differently i mean 

456.76 458.00 A: um [noise] it's 

458.05 470.21 A: do you understand that men and women we're we're equal well first off i don't want to come off as sexist [laughter] but men and women um we have different verbal communications skills 

470.07 471.05 B: right 

470.46 476.75 A: and women are better at understanding the underlying question in a phrase than men are 

477.26 484.83 A: like i i for instance i'll give you a fi- a simple example as the man comes in the door and his wife says did you get milk 

484.64 495.25 A: she may may not necessarily be asking him did you specifically get milk or she may be asking him did you forget to stop at the store do you understand what i mean 

495.09 496.12 B: right 

495.69 504.14 A: there may be an underlying question in within it as opposed to men we're kind of apish and we hear did you get milk and we nod our head yes or no 

504.18 510.92 A: you know no we didn't get milk and we didn't get cheese either 'cause you just asked us if we got milk 

509.99 512.00 B: right [laughter] i see i see so 

511.03 511.59 A: (( [cough] )) 

512.07 517.83 B: in in some sense male the s- the co- co- the conversation between males is very direct it's very 

517.59 522.69 A: yes we're very we're very systematic and logical in a kind of 

518.09 518.94 B: it's ju- 

522.83 525.54 A: i don't know if it's a good way [laughter] manner or a bad manner 

525.50 537.36 B: and then in with women they they don't they they they're they're more tuned to feelings and emotions and they don't want to they don't want to offend or hurt anybody so they'll ask qu- they'll ask a question that be somewhat more sensitive less sensitive 

532.71 533.89 A: yes and when 

537.45 545.00 B: um but to get get at a deeper meaning and so in some oh so another sense is that when a man asks a wo- when a woman asks a man a question 

539.50 541.12 A: mhm 

545.30 550.97 B: or ah i mean what i'm trying to say is that when a man asks a woman a question and the man has an underlying tone to he question 

550.55 552.41 A: mhm 

551.07 554.85 B: the woman is more attuned to what that underlying tone is 

554.38 555.32 A: yes 

554.97 559.74 B: and the whe- it kin- and the vice versa is is ah is not ah true or 

559.54 563.72 A: yes yes it's like if you have a couple and the couple asks one another 

563.63 576.49 A: if the woman asks the man how are you feeling the man will say good or bad and if a man asks a woman how are you feeling she'll have a she'll have a a paragraph of how she's feeling you know she's better at communicating 

576.56 580.54 A: than the man is as the man will just say i'm feeling good as opposed to 

580.71 595.65 A: i'm feeling good 'cause i won a hundred dollars today i had a great lunch i had a great conversation with my you know employee as opposed to a woman will not say good or bad she'll come out and tell you about how good or bad her day had been 

595.78 597.70 B: right right 

596.84 598.86 A: so it's just simple like that 

598.07 599.89 B: (( right right i agree with that ))
