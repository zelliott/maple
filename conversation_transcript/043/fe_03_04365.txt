6.97 8.13 B: hi how are you doing 

9.22 11.95 B: hm kind of an odd question today [laughter] 

11.10 18.61 A: yeah it is actually this is ah my first time doing this so yeah oh really oh 

12.90 13.59 B: so 

14.99 17.45 B: oh is it yeah this is my third call 

17.66 21.47 B: yeah they let you do up to three calls so this is the third time i called in so 

20.93 24.88 A: really all right so anonymous benefactor then 

25.32 27.31 B: yeah an unidentified person right 

26.88 29.07 A: huh that's right 

27.86 30.20 B: yeah gives you a million dollars [cough] 

30.50 32.35 B: i would take the million dollars [laughter] 

32.12 33.23 A: would you 

33.36 38.64 B: yeah because ah i have a best friend but the best friend that i have i hardly ever see 

39.36 40.34 A: oh 

40.20 48.98 B: so there's not that really i mean there's an emotional attachment i've known her since i was two years old and i'm like thirty three years old but i i would take the million dollars 

49.50 62.76 A: man i'd i'd i would have to disagree then th- that's just it's the wrong thing to do i mean me coming from ah being a a twenty two year old guy um got more life to live and all these um 

62.96 70.46 A: ah my my future ahead of me and what not i just can't ah let go of my best friend he's been there from 

68.70 72.68 B: he real friendly it's probably because it's a really good best friend 

71.72 82.41 A: yeah i mean i i've known him pretty much all my life and just to say no i'm not gonna talk to you anymore just because i have a million dollars uh-uh that's not gonna work for me 

81.44 89.48 B: yeah see i don't have those strong i i pr- i just don't see her that much so there's not that bond you know like it was you know when we were younger 

85.28 87.62 A: yeah 

90.14 96.56 B: so at this point at this point in time yeah i would do it [cough] would i have done it fifteen twenty years ago no way 

90.23 90.88 A: (( mm )) 

97.19 99.34 A: (( gotcha i mean ah i )) 

98.27 100.06 B: well people change you know 

100.38 105.69 A: understand with the with the my friend daemon i mean 

102.01 103.32 B: [laughter] 

106.02 116.40 A: jeeze [sigh] i mean he goes to u._t. right now i mean he's down for the summer so i mean we're talking again and what not but even though i mean we're still talk on the internet and what not you know 

116.74 118.08 A: keep in touch 

118.15 119.68 B: right right 

118.93 125.40 A: (( so but like i say just to throw it all away just for money )) 

122.91 125.94 B: i never thought i'd ever say that but i mean [cough] 

125.99 128.99 B: you know what i mean 'cause money's not really that important to me but 

129.26 136.28 B: the situation is for me that's who i consider my best friend she was my maid of honor and everything i've known her since i was two 

136.33 145.95 B: but i would er not two i'm sorry i've known her since i was four and she was two but it there's no o- there but yeah i would take it at this point 'cause i don't feel i have any any best friends that 

146.47 151.08 B: [cough] you know are really best friends anymore in you know in that best friend kind of mode 

151.07 158.35 A: right right well i also guess it ah depends upon the circumstance which you're in at that point of in your life 

156.22 159.40 B: right years ago i would have said no way 

159.24 161.04 A: yeah 

161.02 166.87 B: but at this point [cough] yeah it's it's i don't know it's kinda odd that i would say that but [laughter] 

164.50 172.98 A: but i mean i mean if i was in debt up to my ears and there was like no way out i mean i i might actually do it but 

173.04 176.51 A: phew it would be so hard for me to say yes you know 

176.28 177.75 B: right right 

178.35 184.22 B: well it must be really a a best friend like i said i really don't have that kind of best friend so it's easy for me to say 

184.31 186.14 B: yeah i would take it you know 

185.69 188.14 A: mm right mhm 

186.27 200.82 B: [laughter] i think most people i don't know if most people have best friends i've just i i know i personally had one but i don't i don't know i mean if i were to say that's my best friend i would say she's my best friend but i could i could give it i could move out state tomorrow and never see her again 

200.68 202.89 A: (( [laughter] she )) 

201.68 212.71 B: i mean you know what i mean it's odd but 'cause they don't keep really she doesn't keep in touch with me i'm always the one keeping in touch with her it's like it's that way with a lot of my relationships and like i just get to the point where i'm like well 

203.04 206.90 A: right right 

213.08 218.35 B: take it or leave it now kind of i know it's weird but i think i dunno people change i guess 

218.97 224.73 A: i dunno for for me right now i mean i'd i know i haven't lived all that much but i mean 

224.80 226.24 A: um 

226.59 237.71 A: people that i that i meet people that ah become good friends i mean not like best best close friends like my friend daemon but i mean we still keep in contact with everybody at least i try to so i mean 

235.41 236.61 B: right 

237.06 248.73 B: yeah my teens weren't you know i'm not i'm not that much older than you i'm thirty three but when all your friends have a billion kids [laughter] which i don't have kids yet ah it you it's almost like they fall off the face of the earth 

240.58 242.45 A: right right 

243.28 247.61 A: uh-huh [laughter] 

249.03 251.11 B: and that friendship you had has gone 

249.22 250.57 A: i can imagine 

250.94 252.99 A: right right 

252.76 266.86 B: so i don't know if it's a it's a timing kind of thing i mean i i i probably people do still have best friends that you know older when they're older but i p- i don't really have what they you know what a definition would be so it's easy for me to say yeah i'll take the million and run [laughter] 

265.72 269.19 A: [laughter] right yeah [laughter] 

268.02 269.85 B: [laughter] so [cough] 

270.39 274.10 B: especially right now since i don't have a lot of money and i'm not employed [laughter] 

273.91 275.21 A: oh i'm sorry 

274.53 276.61 B: self employed right now so 

276.00 277.36 A: oh really 

276.62 284.99 B: yeah i do some businesses on the side but you know it doesn't mean it's you know it's you know flowing in enough i mean i'm married thank god because if he didn't have a income coming in i don't know what we would do 

285.32 288.59 B: you know but ah it's just a tough market out there right now 

289.27 291.39 A: oh trust me i know 

289.98 298.19 B: like i myself have a degree but just haven't found anything that i mean i worked for e._d._s. and g._m. for a couple of years but um i just didn't like corporate life 

296.08 297.92 A: (( oh really )) 

298.20 304.49 A: oh gosh i'm i'm working at ah tech support so i know the feeling 

303.30 305.95 B: yeah right right so 

307.60 314.95 B: [cough] i guess they might want us to say why like in your case why wouldn't you take the million dollars i mean what what's so great about your best friend 

312.49 314.22 A: (( i wouldn't )) 

315.36 317.09 A: well i mean 

315.47 322.16 B: you know what i mean they might be wondering that what what makes you you know him worth more than a million dollars to you 

317.17 318.97 A: right 

321.54 326.96 A: well i mean he's pretty much been there for me in times of need um 

327.06 331.23 A: we ah well myself i went through a rough time um 

331.47 341.84 A: and ah he just comforted me through the whole thing and kind of like a a mentor kind of um lean sh- lean on my shoulder and you'll be all right you know that kind of thing 

340.73 342.25 B: mhm mhm 

341.83 350.19 A: and um for that i'm eternally grateful and he's still there yeah 

345.46 348.84 B: and he's still there like you guys still see each other 

349.12 351.20 B: even though you're in co- you're in college right 

350.93 361.49 A: yeah i'm in houston he goes to ah college in u._t. in in austin so i mean yeah i mean there's three hours driving but that's neither here nor there i mean i try to see him as much as i can 

361.13 370.01 B: right and like you said even if you're keeping in touch see we don't we don't have phone calls maybe four times a year and she lives maybe fif- fifteen miles from me 

366.36 367.13 A: yeah 

367.48 371.04 A: mhm 

371.27 372.95 B: so it's like 

373.04 377.19 B: [lipsmack] but i understand what you're saying you can not have to see someone and they can still be your best friend 

376.95 382.52 A: yeah i mean with daemon i i i could i couldn't just give up anything like that for him 

381.45 382.93 B: right right 

383.47 385.12 A: but um 

384.48 391.38 B: [laughter] interesting question though i was kinda shocked about that question today and i was kinda shocked about what i was gonna say too 

385.29 385.87 A: (( yeah )) 

387.03 391.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

392.43 398.15 B: my god years ago like i thought i would of said ah no way but i don't know 

398.90 404.30 B: [lipsmack] maybe it's 'cause i don't have that best friend maybe if i had that real best friend then i would say no way 

402.69 404.38 A: (( yeah )) 

405.84 408.21 A: well i'm glad i have him so 

408.43 414.36 B: well the person i do call best friend hey if you're out there give me a million dollars [laughter] just kidding [laughter]

428.97 433.45 A: ah you would not why you would take this cash 

433.00 438.56 B: oh well because the person who's m- who has been my best friend my whole life is not around anymore 

438.86 443.21 B: and i don't feel an emotional need for her as a friend or 

443.33 446.11 B: a need to even hang out because we never hang out 

446.41 449.54 B: the only time i talk to her is when she has problems with her husband

449.85 454.63 B: you know or ah or you know about her and her career i mean we don't talk about 

454.45 467.88 B: we just we just don't hang out like people do or friends you know or say hey what's up just to say what's up things changed between us so i would i would take it 'cause there's not that emotional attachment like there used to be i mean i wouldn't anything to happen to her or anything but 

459.28 460.73 A: right 

467.48 470.28 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

468.43 470.76 B: (( i just yeah i just you know i don't know )) 

471.72 474.13 B: not just don't feel the same way i used to feel 

476.86 487.54 A: [noise] hm hm [laughter] yeah that's when you said i was like yeah are you sure you want to don't want to reconsider you know but ah 

476.89 481.03 B: (( well wouldn't want her to know that like i said she must have been a pretty good friend to be my maid of honor [laughter] )) 

483.48 484.32 B: yep 

486.35 487.42 B: right

495.80 501.64 A: (( all )) 

496.95 504.26 B: i mean i i like i said i mean i still care about her but as far as like what it does for me the friendship it's it's not absolutely hardly an- anything 

504.43 506.98 A: right 

504.78 511.40 B: you know if i have a problem i don't really talk to anybody about it but maybe my husband or just maybe some people i've met online 

511.63 518.48 B: but um or a f- male friend of mine that i have but even i don't see him that much 'cause he's so busy working like seventy hours a week 

518.69 520.66 A: yeah yeah [laughter]
