1.33 3.00 B: hi this is frank 

2.82 4.82 A: hi frank i'm mark how are you 

4.37 5.45 B: okay 

5.53 6.88 A: um where are ya 

8.34 9.29 B: where am i 

9.07 10.13 A: yeah 

9.50 10.94 B: ah new jersey 

10.94 13.57 A: new jersey oh okay you're not too far i'm in phili 

13.15 14.19 B: (( oh okay )) 

14.38 21.34 A: ah so um [mn] this ah question sounds [laughter] sounds a little ludicrous if you ask me 

20.07 21.54 B: [laughter] you're right 

21.67 24.23 B: ah personally speaking ah 

24.96 27.94 B: i feel it'd be a tough thing to to accept 

27.94 29.48 A: you would accept it 

28.95 31.14 B: no i don't think i i don't think i could 

30.29 32.63 A: oh you wouldn't accept it no i 

31.64 33.69 B: no i just think ah 

36.42 38.82 B: you know the contact that you have with ah 

39.35 45.10 B: you know with your good friends it's i think that you would miss a lot and i don't think that that could be replaced with money 

41.36 42.24 A: yeah 

45.10 54.05 A: well ah the thing is how could they ever ah how could they ever ah prove that though you know like you could you could sneak sneakily talk to your friend you know 

54.16 57.09 A: are they going to have like a twenty four hour camera on your or something 

56.92 59.04 B: [mn] [laughter] right well yeah i mean 

57.51 67.77 A: it's to do with like if if it was like the c._i._a. offering that i would never take it [laughter] you know 'cause they're probably already just spying on us in some weird way but um 

61.77 63.14 B: right 

65.91 68.22 B: right yeah i mean 

68.74 74.63 B: yeah if you're thinking of ways of getting around it that's that's a different thing but yeah i mean just taking it ah at 

75.11 76.54 B: face value 

76.67 77.93 B: um 

79.41 84.30 B: i i think it would be a i think it would be a very difficult thing to accept 

84.62 86.74 A: yeah certainly certainly 

86.77 93.47 B: (( yeah i mean i don't think i could i mean i don't have ah i guess one best friend ah i mean i have a )) 

93.63 94.92 B: a few ah 

95.07 99.93 B: you know good friends so in my case it would be difficult to pinpoint it anyway 

96.39 98.26 A: right 

99.71 101.01 A: yeah then you have to 

100.78 113.77 A: and what if we actually told somebody that that you know the guy that's giving you a million dollars you could tell him that somebody else was your best friend who totally wasn't your best friend you know i mean you didn't really care or somebody who used to be your best friend but now you hate [laughter] like you 

108.04 109.33 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

113.76 115.92 A: like you said a girlfriend or something you know 

115.96 119.23 B: [laughter] so it sounds like you really want the money but you don't want to all right 

118.65 133.13 A: [laughter] [laughter] well i think that the stipulations are are are ah funny i think i i'm the kind of the questions the authority sort of guy [laughter] so i figure there must be a way around it you know take the money and run 

127.37 128.23 B: right 

132.97 134.17 B: (( mhm right mm hm )) 

133.54 147.18 A: and tell 'em you need it in a in a in a leather suitcase ah at the airport at two o'clock in the afternoon left exactly at the at the front of the ah you know actually no i guess they couldn't do that not at the airport say the train station no 

147.39 151.12 A: (( say the wawa [laughter] i don't know )) 

151.57 152.76 A: but anyway 

151.58 155.52 B: yeah well i mean if if you didn't have to 

156.01 160.88 B: you know take the offer ah genuinely w- would you ah would you accept it no 

160.26 164.38 A: no i wouldn't of course not nah money's not worth that 

163.87 164.73 B: (( yeah yeah this )) 

164.65 165.88 A: certainly not 

166.48 168.16 A: certainly not 

167.76 175.82 B: is similar i had a previous ah call through this where it was a million dollars to to leave and never return to the country 

168.21 169.89 A: although i hear although 

176.38 177.11 A: (( mm )) 

177.55 179.84 A: what'd you say about that 

178.93 181.13 B: that one i would accept because 

180.51 183.56 A: yeah definitely [laughter] me too absolutely 

182.78 185.34 B: [laughter] yeah i mean 'cause there's there's lots of 

186.49 189.26 B: you know ways of getting around that which ah 

189.39 200.09 B: you know contact with people and still live outside you know close to the the borders of the country to have people visit you so that would be a totally different thing 

198.39 200.99 A: (( sure you could move to toronto or something you know )) 

200.58 202.45 B: exactly 

201.45 215.26 A: it's a nice town i lived there for a little while [mn] yeah i mean that that's a that's a d- and plus you could you could i mean with a million dollars you know if you invested it wisely or whatever then you could ah you know pay to fly your friends and family out to wherever you were 

203.61 204.65 B: (( oh okay )) 

214.91 216.50 B: oh absolutely [laughter] 

215.83 216.66 A: (( you know )) 

216.82 222.60 A: and on top of that a million dollars goes a heck of a long way you could retire in a place like ah you know 

222.65 231.26 A: i don't know thailand or something you you would never ever have to work again [laughter] you know do whatever you want if fact if i ever won the lottery i would go back to 

232.86 235.27 A: just 'cause you could laugh about you know 

235.89 247.65 A: ah i lived in ah south east asia for a while and there [mn] you can live there for like ten dollars a day in thailand a lot of people are actually retiring there now funny enough and 

247.64 249.62 B: (( mm oh yes it seems like you've ah lived )) 

249.81 251.30 B: all over the world huh ah 

251.36 256.21 A: ah um i've done a fair amount of travelling yeah oh yeah i enjoy it 

255.15 256.59 B: so would you ah 

257.09 262.52 B: with all that moving would would you be able to pin point one best friend or uh-huh mm 

262.03 266.16 A: oh no definitely not not i i mean 

266.18 273.56 A: no i couldn't i could i mean i'm ah one of ah five children so i i couldn't even name one of my siblings you know 

274.03 278.39 A: it'd it'd be hard i don't know how there would there's not one best friend i don't thing so 

278.88 281.45 A: oh not when you travel a lot you know 

281.31 283.57 B: yeah i would think maybe in your situation 

283.82 287.30 B: you know as you move around so often it might be easier 

287.50 290.63 B: you know for you since you don't have maybe you know a 

290.95 292.65 B: a good friend that you've you know 

293.59 295.58 A: spent yeah spent my whole 

294.13 298.67 B: been been ar- been around for you know the last twenty or thirty years or so 

298.18 301.54 A: right no yeah i know i haven't i have 

301.99 307.93 A: ah i'm twenty six but i i grew up in california and then my folks moved up to ah philadelphia 

307.91 308.77 B: (( ah )) 

308.30 310.61 A: and ah when i was thirteen so 

310.68 314.92 A: we all kind of like [mn] i left all the childhood friends behind and 

314.94 319.70 A: sort of made new friends at high school and then new friends in college and new friends all over 

319.67 331.88 B: mm yeah it sounds like it might be easier for you if you if you did want to accept an offer like that if it were with me i mean i pretty much spent my whole life in this area so yeah the friends that i've made i've 

320.48 322.16 A: yeah 

323.44 325.94 A: right yeah

334.06 335.81 B: yeah for a very long time 

335.68 338.99 A: right right so it'd be a different story for you certainly
