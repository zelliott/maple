4.48 6.00 B: (( nice to meet you )) 

6.23 9.18 B: um wow a million dollars is a lot 

8.70 12.76 A: it is but there's better ways to make it than losing your best friend 

12.21 14.16 B: [laughter] that's true 

14.31 18.43 B: um right after they said um best friend i was thinking 

18.70 27.56 B: well my husband's my best friend i have best female friends but i don't think i would want to give any of them up for a million dollars 

27.64 40.99 A: i think i have given up a best friend but she did a lot of of ah [laughter] stupid things but she's not worth the million dollars her her life to me and her her value as a human 

34.11 34.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

41.24 43.65 A: just don't cut a million dollars 

43.07 44.06 B: right 

43.75 52.01 A: i i mean really i could ideally go out and save and save and save my entire life and be sixty and have a million dollars 

52.02 54.26 A: if i spend no money you know 

53.87 55.28 B: that's true 

54.82 57.34 A: and and i just i don't think that ah 

57.66 60.16 A: [laughter] that it's really worth it 

60.28 68.01 B: you also have the opportunity if you live long enough to meet lots of different people and there's an there's a possibility that you could [noise] 

68.09 73.88 B: meet someone who with whom you're very compatible but ah it's 

73.91 76.82 B: i i don't think i would take the million dollars 

77.77 82.54 A: i think that if i did i would i would have to donate most of it to charities 

82.57 83.51 A: just 

82.76 86.00 B: that's i probably would too i remember um 

86.53 92.68 B: saying one time i wish ed mcmahon would come knock on my door and and [noise] my husband said oh no we couldn't afford the taxes 

92.31 95.48 A: [laughter] that's that's very true 

95.18 96.14 B: [laughter] 

95.75 101.93 A: of course it depends upon where you live and and how they do it and all that kind of stuff 

100.87 101.61 B: (( [noise] )) 

101.76 103.10 B: that's true 

102.69 111.17 A: but ah in my state they're doing lots of taxing for road construction and building of new ah sports facilities and that kind of a thing 

109.07 110.06 B: (( [noise] )) 

110.76 111.76 B: uh-huh 

111.23 115.35 A: and i would just get slaughtered with with extra point five percent 

111.93 112.75 B: (( [noise] )) 

115.64 116.97 A: whatevers 

116.37 117.44 B: [noise] 

117.46 119.94 A: for anything that i ever wanted 

118.48 119.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

119.84 132.89 B: [laughter] that's true so if you donate it to charity you get the tax credit and you get [noise] ah a good name and [laughter] [laughter] it's on your hands 

128.83 130.86 A: and it's not on your hands anymore 

133.18 137.46 A: i think i think a lot of people would crawl out of the woodwork if i had a million dollars as well 

137.36 146.32 B: i've heard that when people win the lottery and um they get millions and millions of dollars all of a sudden everybody's their best friend 

146.09 148.87 A: yeah people you haven't seen for ten years oh hi 

146.36 147.28 B: so 

148.39 150.38 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

149.20 150.28 A: (( who are you again )) 

150.83 154.69 A: i i don't i don't think that money is really worth it um 

154.17 155.26 B: no 

155.21 160.89 A: and and looking at the way other millionaires have run their lives um you know drug problems 

161.21 164.73 A: [laughter] i don't know how they manage it but debt problems um 

164.87 166.80 A: just kind of frighten me 

166.74 171.96 B: it's very stressful it's like they say that money breaks up a lot of marriages 

172.76 179.09 B: um i don't know if you ever saw the movie oh i can't even remember what the the title of the movie was but it was um 

179.04 190.92 B: [lipsmack] nicholas cage and rosie perez and he won the lottery and he had agreed to give a waitress half of his lottery and and his 

190.92 201.52 B: rosie perez was the wife and she just got all serious and and they had to divorce and i know that's a movie i know it's a hypothetical situation but [mn] it could happen 

199.42 200.61 A: it could happen 

201.79 206.97 A: so many things happen it's not even funny i you know there are people who who ah 

207.61 208.45 A: who 

208.49 215.13 A: they say if i do if if i were to win this or if i were to get this i'd do this and then they don't and they back down completely 

214.67 216.00 B: mhm 

215.35 219.71 A: and and is it just that they say these things because 

220.33 222.38 A: because they don't think it's going to happen 

222.80 225.63 A: do they say these things to look good 

225.76 231.75 A: and then hope that it doesn't happen so they don't have to do it or intend to not do it at all as a form of fraud 

232.12 233.30 B: ooh wow 

232.94 237.70 A: it's kind of you know there's double edged swords to almost every thought 

234.23 234.97 B: [laughter] 

237.26 239.11 B: that's right that's right 

238.19 240.52 A: and that kind of frightens me [noise] 

240.68 254.43 B: oh i know that i've worked in um a lot of situations when um you get a commitment from someone even if it's just to show up to a meeting you get a commitment from someone and then the commitment falls through and 

254.55 258.22 B: sometimes i give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe they 

258.83 261.26 B: had something come up last minute but 

261.46 266.90 B: it's hard to give some people benefit benefit of the doubt over and over and over [laughter] 

266.47 269.82 A: well you know second chances are 

269.74 284.01 A: are nice and all but you can't keep being walked over because somebody else is not as trustworthy or honest or even values other people's time as much as they value themselves or think that they should be valued 

283.45 284.80 B: that's true 

284.56 289.45 A: and i think a lot of people's perspective would change if they had the million dollars 

289.52 297.25 A: you know it would be oh look at me um i have this money you don't ha ha type of a thing and that's kind of 

294.07 294.88 B: that's 

297.28 299.52 A: i know people like that which frightens me 

299.07 300.05 B: (( oh )) 

299.70 300.56 A: um 

300.97 303.42 A: but i think it just makes things difficult 

303.71 306.96 A: i think any large amount of money makes things difficult 

307.73 313.41 B: yeah i know that whenever we get like a little a bonus check from work or 

313.51 322.62 B: ah one time my husband won a small sum from a radio contest and um ooh wow new money what do you do with it 

322.31 323.87 A: buy something [laughter] 

323.23 331.85 B: [laughter] do you pay bills do you invest do you get the new toy that the kid's been wanting do you give it to 

330.90 332.86 A: get the new toy you've been wanting 

332.35 334.65 B: (( get the new toy you've been wanting )) 

334.70 338.37 B: [laughter] oh my goodness [noise] yeah 

337.03 344.83 A: there's there's just so many options and i mean you can really get yourself in quite a bit of trouble if you think you have more than you really do 

340.24 341.05 B: (( [noise] )) 

344.86 352.29 A: if you know the government decides that taxes taxes are more important to them or do them than what you thought they were 

352.03 353.24 B: right 

352.56 356.52 A: you can overspend now you don't have any money now you don't have any money 

356.53 363.85 B: [laughter] you know a thought occurred to me um a little bit ago that if um 

363.88 364.70 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

364.80 368.04 B: oh what was it the the question was if you 

368.05 378.62 B: were given a million dollars you had to stop speaking to your best friend well if you got a million dollars all of a sudden you've got hundreds of new best friends [laughter] [laughter] 

376.01 377.20 A: that's true 

377.67 379.19 A: but i guess 

379.07 383.26 A: [mn] the question also goes into what do you consider your best friend 

383.02 394.71 A: like you were saying your husband versus your female best friends i mean really you could get new best friends but they could be completely dishonest and greedy and money mongers and everything else 

394.10 395.52 B: that's right mhm 

394.94 397.55 A: so you really it's not so much 

397.70 408.46 A: trust is a big issue when it comes to money and and one would hope that you have a best friend you can trust and that's you know part of the reason they are your best friend 

408.03 409.29 B: that's right 

408.82 412.18 A: but if you had to give them up for somebody completely new almost 

412.78 413.95 A: (( a._s._a._p. )) 

414.03 416.99 A: i'd be kind of afraid of you know why they were there 

417.46 431.46 B: [lipsmack] it's amazing and i wouldn't want you know you work so hard on friendships um it really is a a working relationship that you work on for years and um i wouldn't want to 

431.35 432.80 B: betray 

433.10 436.47 B: something that i'd worked so hard for for money 

436.32 437.30 A: yeah 

436.71 438.06 B: that would just be 

438.51 440.80 A: it would kind of drag you through the mud 

440.92 442.95 B: yes yes 

443.44 447.31 B: even if i did promise to give it to charity i don't think i would ever feel the same 

447.27 448.09 A: no 

448.28 461.27 A: i mean well here's the thing can you can you get it not talk to your best friend pay all the taxes divvy it up invest it and then speak to them again how do they know that that you aren't speaking to them 

460.38 462.97 B: [laughter] you know i always 

461.84 463.97 A: (( do you all of a sudden have wire taps )) 

463.55 465.78 B: i always look for those loopholes 

465.88 475.41 B: okay so are you talking about not speaking to my best friend ever or not speak to them just on the phone or just in person [laughter] [laughter] 

472.97 473.69 A: (( [laughter] )) 

474.70 485.21 A: yeah it it just you know there's there's so many different things in communication nowadays what things mean there's so many different meanings for for simple words 

484.76 485.84 B: mhm 

485.52 492.04 A: um and there are many loopholes to to negative things 

493.60 502.85 B: that's true well as as society has shown how much we sue people that you can find loopholes just about anywhere 

502.65 504.42 A: that's that's very true 

504.51 508.72 A: um however some people won't allow you to go through them 

508.98 510.22 A: they'll they'll 

510.25 512.93 A: take you to court for any little thing that they can 

512.65 514.07 B: that's right 

513.59 527.14 A: and ah that's that's kind of frightening and i wouldn't wonder if somebody you know if if you owed somebody way back you know ten years ago five dollars or something and now you have this money do they take you to court for it 

527.57 529.22 B: oh wow [mn] 

528.70 532.81 A: i- you know there's there's people who would and that's kind of 

533.11 534.73 A: kind of strange [noise] 

534.01 535.70 B: yeah i 

535.81 538.72 B: [sigh] in some ways um 

539.18 541.94 B: it's good that we're 

542.19 547.53 B: creating legislation to put limits on um on litigation but 

547.60 548.44 B: on 

548.44 563.02 B: in other perspectives it's tough to put limits on litigation because sometimes people who really do need to right a wrong are prevented from righting that wrong because the new laws say no you can't 

563.17 566.11 B: sue somebody within this 

566.25 568.87 B: area but you can sue them within that area 

569.59 572.99 B: [lipsmack] it's very frustrating trying to legalize morality 

573.27 576.83 A: that's that's very true and values and beliefs as well 

576.81 578.17 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

577.56 579.69 A: um just because 

579.72 581.82 A: of what our nation was formed on 

582.07 584.67 A: and and everybody who comes from 

584.87 590.49 A: from then until now has different ideas of what their american dream is going to be 

590.31 591.55 B: right 

590.97 599.89 A: and i- you know i have there's there's a lot of mexican workers in this area that they're here for six months to a y-
