4.91 8.08 A: this is really weird [laughter] this is really 

6.00 8.90 B: huh yeah i know is this your first time 

8.21 9.51 A: yes it is 

9.04 13.64 B: oh this is well this is my second time [sigh] ah it isn't half bad 

11.54 12.40 A: oh 

13.45 14.69 A: oh okay 

13.94 24.46 B: right right um well lemme see i was thinking about the time travels thing and um i think i'd go back to you know when i was in um i'm ah irish catholic so 

24.19 25.19 A: mhm 

24.53 35.01 B: ah i remember my mother um talking to me and i was going to go into the seminary at that time and it was ear- you know before i guess 

35.12 39.24 B: probably it was the fifty eight fifty nine sixty that around there 

38.99 39.97 A: mhm 

39.26 50.88 B: and ah so anyway ah what happened was that ah she ah she suggested that i i not go into the seminary and that i wait until i graduated from high school and then go in 

50.83 51.77 A: mhm 

51.10 55.83 B: so what happened was that you know all that you know i 

56.12 61.26 B: as i look back i often wonder about you know what would have happened had i 

61.31 69.88 B: you know gone into the seminary and and um so i i often always wanted to do that so 

70.54 76.02 B: that that so i i think i would have liked to have you know tried the seminary 

75.83 76.98 A: right 

76.40 78.09 B: you know but 

77.00 77.94 A: i think 

78.38 79.69 A: oh go ahead i'm sorry 

79.44 82.11 B: so um 

82.15 84.83 B: i think that's basically it yeah 

84.27 86.97 A: okay well mine is i think i would definitely go back 

87.31 89.53 A: to high school even though i'm only 

89.73 92.52 A: seven years out of high school i'd definitely go back 

92.13 93.31 B: right 

92.71 95.82 A: and i would study a lot harder and be more 

96.19 97.13 A: (( ah )) 

97.37 99.33 A: i guess goal orientated 

99.37 101.00 B: okay okay 

100.01 104.16 A: one thing i'd definitely i got outta high school got into college wasn't very 

104.79 106.42 A: goal orientated 

106.04 107.67 B: right i see 

107.28 111.30 A: and then i end up getting married and then now i'm a stay at home mom so i 

111.81 112.54 B: right 

111.85 113.52 A: didn't go back to school 

113.32 114.46 B: okay 

114.14 116.23 A: so i think i would have been a little bit more 

117.08 121.12 A: goal orientated even though i'm thankful for everything i have now 

120.81 122.59 B: sure sure 

121.87 124.18 A: i definitely would have liked to have 

124.77 126.24 A: paid more attention 

126.37 127.46 B: right 

126.41 129.91 A: and use my mind instead of wasted it you know wasting it on 

130.30 132.70 A: not studying and 

132.89 134.22 A: that type of thing 

133.92 140.20 B: right well you know it it's it's kind of funny i mean there are two different thing ways to i mean 

140.16 150.27 B: from my story and your story there's there's a certain kind of a similarity in terms of you know like we still have a shot at doing what we we want to do 

150.31 157.55 B: you know i could i've been thinking along the lines of ah you know becoming a brother in a monastery 

157.13 158.39 A: mhm 

157.66 159.58 B: that's one of the things i've been doing 

159.53 172.97 B: and in your instance you know i know a lot of women ah that have been um you know that ah go to school and they're all of these alternative programs just for women like you 

168.10 169.04 A: right

217.07 218.94 B: right

269.93 274.64 B: um to you know kinda look back at what we're do 

275.14 277.98 B: where we are and where we were in 

277.62 278.65 A: right 

278.03 280.01 B: and and if

287.42 290.20 A: exactly it's not it's not like it's too late 

289.43 291.64 B: [sigh] right [sigh]

293.73 295.46 A: something that can you know 

295.32 296.48 B: right 

295.63 297.93 A: something that definitely can be worked on 

297.48 304.61 B: yeah and it and ah then there's that whole ah you know that lou ross ah song if i woulda coulda shoulda 

304.41 305.45 A: yeah

305.52 308.83 A: (( mhm exactly exactly [laughter] )) 

310.16 318.57 A: i'm sure there's ah hundreds of things i'd like to go back and review i don't know if you know i'd love to do them over again not necessarily change them [laughter] 

312.16 316.08 B: right yeah sure [laughter] 

318.11 330.13 B: right yeah i could i know i can do a better job this time [laughter] [laughter] right with all of the things you've learned and yeah and all the experiences we we've had it's it's kind of a 

321.79 324.30 A: yeah [laughter] exactly 

330.68 333.98 B: way of looking at things but it 

332.18 333.51 A: definitely 

334.04 335.29 A: definitely 

334.62 336.04 B: yeah 

335.39 341.82 A: so that's really interesting the though going into the seminary that was that's really interesting 

339.48 341.23 B: right right i 

341.60 344.13 B: well at that time it 

344.14 352.12 B: being a catholic it it's like vatican two and all of those things where they liberalized catholicism and so on there was a big thing 

350.38 351.26 A: mhm 

352.13 366.17 B: and i in one sense i i kinda understand where my mother was coming from um but on the other on on the other hand you know it was the kinda thing where i kept on thinking about what how can i 

358.47 359.34 A: right 

366.65 377.66 B: you know what what would have happened you know and i it it's always been a you know one of those things you you wonder about 

369.83 370.83 A: right
