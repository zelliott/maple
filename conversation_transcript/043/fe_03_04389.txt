1.55 3.76 A: hi hi [mn] 

3.02 3.58 B: (( [mn] )) 

4.40 6.07 A: john [laughter] 

5.48 7.48 B: pete how you doing john 

7.33 9.22 A: oh pretty good how are you 

9.05 10.55 B: not too bad 

9.94 12.23 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

11.61 13.09 B: so ah would you 

13.76 17.24 B: ah break your best friend break with your best friend for a million dollars 

17.61 24.47 A: oh [laughter] that's a tough one well probably i'd have to say my best friend is my wife so 

23.79 24.65 B: uh-huh 

24.41 37.98 A: ah i'd probably i guess i'd have to say no on that one [laughter] yeah though you know you'd think about it for just a second but [laughter] i think i'd have to say no [laughter] yeah 

27.86 29.42 B: really yeah 

32.77 34.12 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

34.31 39.69 B: i wouldn't have to i wouldn't have to think about that at all i think friendship is worth more than than money [mn] 

38.24 44.72 A: oh yeah i know definitely definitely i mean yeah i would agree 

44.14 46.47 B: well nowadays a million dollars is not a lot 

46.31 52.96 A: yeah what's that no that's true i mean you know you could use up a million dollars pretty quick really i mean yeah 

47.62 48.34 B: (( ah [mn] )) 

51.10 55.59 B: yeah i've never had i've never i haven't got that much but ah [laughter] 

53.84 59.71 A: no i haven't come close but ah yeah it's ah yeah i mean um 

59.76 63.79 A: nah i wouldn't take a million dollars for anything like that really i mean ah 

63.74 75.07 A: ah you know i mean i think plus i'm pretty happy working for my money you know [laughter] i think it's better to work for your money rather than to get be given to it and given it anyway um 

69.43 70.23 B: yeah 

74.24 81.25 B: right plus the fact that if you don't have friendships then ah probably your life would not be as happy 

81.45 85.19 B: you might have money but you would be miserable in your money 

81.51 82.54 A: well yeah 

83.15 84.14 A: right 

84.71 89.22 A: sure and then of course you know i mean th- obviously with money you'd ah 

85.48 86.25 B: yeah 

89.36 102.32 A: you'd ah there'd be friends that would show up [laughter] you know but they probably wouldn't be true friends and ah what you know what good would be they'd just be after the money and ah you know and you don't yeah 

91.92 93.04 B: [laughter] 

93.08 93.97 B: yeah but 

95.49 96.32 B: yeah 

98.99 100.04 B: (( yeah )) 

100.14 100.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

101.07 104.27 B: right so you can't buy friends but you can rent them [laughter] 

103.40 110.56 A: yeah that's right that's right yeah that's a good point yeah i never never heard that but that's that's that would be exactly it i mean 

104.30 106.55 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

106.70 107.50 B: yeah 

110.55 119.85 A: yeah they'd probably disappear when the money disappeared yeah and and yeah and so i mean um ah i mean what good would that do and then um 

113.07 114.31 B: oh exactly 

119.91 127.67 A: [lipsmack] yeah i mean ah i think i'd rather spend my time poor and with good friends [laughter] oh and you know 

125.56 127.18 B: yeah exactly 

127.91 129.63 A: i mean not 

129.04 134.85 B: plus the value of friendship i think is is you can't measure it in monetary value anyway 

129.69 130.25 A: (( [mn] )) 

133.69 134.62 A: yeah 

134.77 145.65 A: yeah i mean you know as you say a million two million five million you know it wouldn't be any you know any price that you could say that would be enough you know really for friendship and ah 

135.01 135.81 B: (( ah )) 

144.83 145.70 B: (( oh )) 

145.78 146.82 A: um 

146.86 148.14 A: yeah i mean 

148.73 159.52 A: but i know there's there's probably people out there that would take it and ah you know and that and that do take it i guess it it work for the money rather than ah you know for for 

155.62 156.21 B: (( [mn] )) 

158.94 160.79 B: i guess everybody has a price 

160.72 162.03 A: yeah 

160.97 163.75 B: but that's not it [laughter] 

162.47 173.78 A: no no i guess so [mn] i mean price but i don't know i mean it's you know it's not necessarily in money though yeah it could be in other things that you'd you know but um 

172.81 176.73 B: and then i'd be wondering who um who was offering the money 

176.54 177.52 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

177.27 183.22 B: maybe they want to ah like if it was a marriage they want you to break up so they can um 

182.25 183.89 A: (( ture yeah )) 

183.23 184.43 B: you know um 

184.80 186.71 B: ah get that person 

186.43 189.32 A: right yeah i mean it just [laughter] 

189.39 202.05 A: yeah it just would be it would be very odd to do something like that [laughter] i mean it's or anything anything like that for money it's just just would seem really really totally wrong and ah 

199.15 200.10 B: yeah 

202.30 207.45 A: yeah i definitely wouldn't do it but um [lipsmack] yeah i mean it's [sigh] 

207.72 211.56 A: there's priorities that are different out there i know that [laughter] 

211.12 216.98 B: yeah i know my ah my son is is twenty he has a friend that i would probably pay 

216.65 220.22 A: oh yeah [laughter] yeah right [mn] 

217.24 219.40 B: him to break up with you know 

219.42 229.71 B: but i think it's a very ah a very unhealthy relationship and um and this probably and this prob- person probably would take the money [laughter] you know [mn] 

222.38 223.38 A: (( oh )) 

223.40 224.92 A: (( yeah )) 

229.13 232.76 A: oh yeah re- ah right [laughter] yeah yeah 

230.67 234.13 B: this this person person is is that type of a friend you know 

233.48 236.46 A: really yeah so he would that's the thing 

234.22 241.52 B: it's like my it's like my son it's like my son bought him a stereo for his car 'cause he didn't have one 

236.84 237.54 A: you 

240.55 242.26 A: wow wow 

241.68 243.04 B: (( you know so )) 

243.31 245.07 B: (( um )) 

243.31 244.24 A: yeah 

244.35 246.38 A: and ah yeah i mean that's i'm sure 

246.47 248.88 A: he's happy about that but yeah i mean 

247.91 248.75 B: yeah 

249.32 252.85 A: you know who knows what his true motives are yeah 

251.66 254.47 B: right definitely unhealthy situation 

253.99 258.36 A: yes yeah you you hate to see that but gosh at twenty it's so hard to 

258.25 271.24 A: you know you can obviously see it but i mean you know i mean to get them to see it is [laughter] a whole 'nother thing and yeah i haven't got there yet i only got a three year old so [laughter] but yeah i know i'm 

260.19 261.20 B: mhm 

262.87 264.58 B: right right 

267.51 268.15 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

268.45 269.90 B: plenty of time 

271.43 282.74 A: i'm kind of dreading those situations like that where you're worried about all of their friends you know and all that and yeah i don't i don't know how i'll handle it i guess i'll deal with it when it comes but 

274.29 275.33 B: mhm 

277.46 278.49 B: right 

281.19 291.57 B: [mn] luckily you can do it one day at a time [laughter] [mn] it's just to think of it long term you know that's a long time from now and but you get to do it one time one day at a time and you learn as you go 

283.59 285.35 A: yeah i know i know 

289.19 290.12 A: yeah 

291.48 294.17 A: yeah yeah you do you do yeah 

291.89 294.34 B: and it's um it's a good experience 

294.36 295.49 A: yeah 

294.82 299.43 B: but i don't think you could put a price on on on a relationship 

299.72 303.39 B: um you know day to day week to week year to year 

301.61 302.52 A: mhm 

303.38 304.25 A: no 

303.48 306.07 B: there's just no way to put a monetary price on 

305.78 312.88 A: no don't think you could i mean in that in that situation it just [laughter] it's impossible [mn] you know 

306.87 307.74 B: (( it and ah )) 

309.28 310.02 B: no 

313.19 314.58 A: (( oh well ))

343.72 346.86 A: they called me this time yeah yeah 

345.35 350.31 B: ah then i think yeah they must have a automated thing that calls each one of us and then 

350.00 351.11 A: oh yeah

351.79 353.33 A: oh okay yeah

359.95 360.71 B: yeah 

367.95 368.75 B: yeah 

370.85 377.32 B: it's kind of a hard subject though you know especially to talk ten minutes on 'cause um there's you know 

372.65 374.67 A: yeah yeah 

375.51 380.48 A: is yeah is it ten minutes [laughter] that's how long it yeah 

377.82 379.18 B: (( it is no )) 

379.55 385.67 B: there there's i mean there's probably not any friend that i would i would give up for a million dollars you know 

385.45 386.59 A: yeah 

385.99 391.06 B: and that's kind of that kind of a closed it's kind of a closed um 

391.86 395.46 B: it's not something you can expand on you know it's kind of a yes or no question 

391.94 392.74 A: yeah 

393.24 394.82 A: it's kind of like ah yes 

395.38 397.31 A: yes or no i mean yeah 

395.71 398.98 B: and it's really hard to explain it's hard to expand on 

398.87 405.39 A: that's basically it yeah i mean it's like okay that that's it and yeah you don't can't say a whole lot more about it but yeah it's 

405.12 406.70 B: it other than the um 

407.06 408.98 B: what is friendship worth and 

408.38 409.54 A: right 

409.04 413.96 B: i guess you could do a hypoth- you could do a a term paper on that [laughter] 

412.85 415.19 A: yeah you could you could and ah 

414.05 414.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

415.23 420.08 A: yeah i mean true friends i mean are worth you know certainly priceless and ah 

419.63 420.75 B: right 

420.15 427.21 A: yeah i just you know when you look at life when look back at life you look at your relationships and you know the people you spend time with rather than 

424.52 425.28 B: (( right [mn] )) 

427.21 435.39 A: the money you've earned and all of that well i mean i guess there's obviously a few people that do but look back at the money but i mean you don't i don't think that's i mean if you're ending your 

429.09 429.65 B: (( [mn] )) 

431.65 432.39 B: yeah 

435.40 442.71 A: at the end of your life and you're looking back i mean i think you're gonna think more about the people that are around you and your friendships rather than 

441.90 442.86 B: right 

442.91 446.96 A: the money because at that point it's not gonna do you any good you know you can't take it with you 

443.28 443.84 B: (( [mn] )) 

445.80 449.46 B: yeah 'cause money's just papers it's paper and paper and metal 

447.40 448.41 A: yeah 

449.20 451.14 A: yeah it is yeah 

450.31 454.19 B: and paper and metal is not as important as memories and flesh and blood 

454.31 460.26 A: oh yeah definitely yeah definitely and that's what makes life really yeah that's what make it 

458.04 458.94 B: right 

459.31 462.85 B: a lot of people can count their best friends on one hand 

462.46 464.11 A: yeah well i 

462.99 466.23 B: that's not a that's not good that's not a good ah measure 

466.16 467.16 A: no 

467.22 476.33 A: no i mean yeah i ah i mean obviously i don't have i couldn't say i had a whole lot of close friends but um or acquaintances but then there's ah i mean there's 

476.71 484.81 A: yeah i mean the the friends that i do have are just are really close so i mean at least you know i'm happy about th- [laughter] yeah [mn] 

479.59 481.16 B: (( right right )) 

483.09 483.83 B: yeah 

483.86 487.94 B: especially when um you're married too ah that's that's a very important friend 

487.34 490.24 A: yeah and that's you know i mean i guess 

490.38 497.68 A: yeah sometimes i guess with with men they tend to have you know when they are married ah a lot of times that it you know you're 

493.80 495.22 B: (( mm )) 

497.74 503.24 A: friends sometimes you don't you know have a whole lot of other really close friends sometimes i know that's 

503.38 506.43 A: what i've kind of found myself doing and you know with 

505.45 510.41 B: 'specially when the the ah [mn] the vow says two shall become one flesh 

510.13 511.44 A: right 

510.81 515.20 B: you know how could you sell part of yourself for an amount of money [laughter] you know 

513.05 514.00 A: that 

514.44 519.28 A: yeah no it's it's that's absolutely true yeah you couldn't and yeah 

515.36 516.11 B: i me- 

519.58 526.91 A: [mn] there was that one movie that one time about that wasn't there that i forgot what that wa- i didn't see it but i remember hearing about that like ah 

527.08 528.33 A: oh i think the 

528.60 529.77 A: (( i think it was a )) 

529.81 538.19 A: somebody'd they he would he gave he was gonna give the guy a million dollars for his wife [laughter] basically you know i remember there was something about that and it's like 

534.59 535.70 B: oh yeah 

537.99 540.41 B: but i think it was to rent her not to buy her 

540.44 544.15 A: yeah that's right that was just to rent her yeah yeah yeah that's right 

540.84 541.61 B: yeah 

542.17 542.73 B: (( [mn] )) 

542.91 543.79 B: yeah 

543.99 546.49 B: that'd be a tough one too [laughter] 

544.19 545.09 A: and 

545.67 552.09 A: [laughter] it'd be like no i don't think so because then you'd you know that would be with you your whole life and 

551.62 552.47 B: right 

552.56 560.02 B: 'cause that'd be a you'd remember that forever just like this situation if you gave up a friend that would haunt you 'til you died 

555.85 556.77 A: you would 

559.67 563.80 A: it would yeah yeah i mean you know i guess it's the same thing if you 

563.91 569.45 A: if you get money under false present pretenses you know i mean in some way i mean 

569.78 570.82 A: um 

570.72 585.46 A: you know i mean i know there's people who've killed people for money which is you know i mean it it's just unbelievable to think about that and you know what people do i mean people do that and it's just amazing to think what people you know and they think that that's what it's all about you know but then 

573.60 574.49 B: (( right mhm )) 

579.18 579.92 B: right 

585.54 593.96 A: how could you ever you know even enjoy that money at all i don't know how how you could and if it's if you get it under you know 

588.86 589.76 B: right 

590.34 591.33 B: right 

594.09 597.19 A: certain ways ah that you know are wrong and 

596.66 599.89 B: now what you know they're gonna turn around what if somebody had done that to you
