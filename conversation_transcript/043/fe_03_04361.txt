19.65 25.06 B: choose whether or not to not to speak to our best friend again do we accept the money yeah 

23.46 25.52 A: yeah um 

25.58 28.34 A: i don't know um i don't think so 

28.14 29.64 B: i don't think so either 

29.54 33.39 A: yeah my my best friend and i are pretty close we share about everything 

31.69 36.17 B: yeah best friends are worth more than a million bucks that's for sure 

35.74 36.92 A: yeah 

36.98 38.03 A: um 

38.07 43.94 A: gosh i don't know what el- [laughter] this is the first time i've done this call okay 

39.65 41.80 B: (( what are we supposed to talk about for ten minutes )) 

42.41 47.04 B: me too i just signed up for it the other day and i just got this like call then 

46.55 52.27 A: well i i signed up a couple like a couple of minutes ago so i mean this is really amazing 

52.04 52.92 B: (( oh )) 

52.33 55.28 A: but i think we're supposed to talk about the topic 

54.79 56.02 B: right 

55.37 56.45 A: um 

56.49 58.34 A: (( okay um )) 

58.59 65.56 A: [lipsmack] i don't i don't think that i would do that because i mean how would i be able to keep my end of the deal 

65.81 73.09 A: i would i would always want to call her to tell her that i won a million dollars and i'd want to share that of course with my best friend 

72.57 73.86 B: exactly 

73.95 74.89 A: i mean 

74.58 78.34 B: exactly and that would be a part of your you know your life that 

78.61 81.35 B: that y- you know money can't replace 

80.86 82.55 A: yeah i mean 

81.62 84.86 B: i mean that million dollars can come and go but 

84.98 86.90 B: your best friends are there forever 

86.44 90.90 A: yeah 'cause they say that um money doesn't buy you happiness 

91.25 96.18 A: and then of course if i had the million dollars i would i would want to do something for her so [sigh] 

95.95 97.58 B: exactly 

98.41 105.16 B: yeah it's kind of it's like the old thing would you throw your who would you throw off a lifeboat first 

104.82 106.42 A: yeah [laughter] 

105.33 108.85 B: but actually this i is isn't as difficult because 

109.07 110.25 B: (( i you know )) 

110.73 116.68 B: the million dollars does sound nice for the moment but like you said it's it wears thin and you'd want to be with your friend 

116.25 117.57 A: yeah 

117.05 121.78 B: and ah your f- definitely you can't put a price tag on a friend that's for sure 

122.60 127.64 A: but on the other hand a million dollars sure would change your life wouldn't it 

127.38 132.51 B: yeah it would it would make things nice but you know it's kind of like that thing where 

133.36 138.29 B: you you know it would be an empty i mean it would be empty you know after a while 

138.17 139.10 A: yeah 

138.31 143.78 B: so that million dollars would be nice at first but you'd like long for your friend and 

143.84 151.00 B: and then you'd realize that the money isn't you know i mean it would do a lot sure if geeze i could think of a million ways to spend that 

150.52 161.73 A: yeah i mean well they say that if when you win the million dollars all of all of the people that you really don't know come out of the woodwork because they want something 

161.32 163.32 B: exactly 

163.54 178.24 A: and then if you when you have a best friend you kind of relate rely on your best friend to give you like a like an opinion i mean i my girlfriend's name is becky and i know that if i wore something that was ridiculous she would say what were you thinking 

170.97 171.97 B: sure 

177.91 179.38 B: [laughter] 

179.70 182.34 A: so that that that's pretty much so 

182.71 184.71 A: our relationship 

185.03 191.81 B: yeah i mean and yeah you'd be c- actually cutting off your right arm and saying here i'll take a million dollars for my right arm 

188.44 190.63 A: (( yeah and )) 

191.83 197.04 A: besides who would i get to watch my five year old if i wanted to go spend my million dollars yeah 

196.00 202.54 B: and well for that you could hire a babysitter [laughter] but i mean you know as far as like you know having some kind of 

198.11 200.70 A: [laughter] 

202.59 206.55 B: you know emotional wellbeing if you lost your friend you know it would be 

206.56 211.78 B: you know friends are gifted like you said are you know you can't place a value on them like that 

211.65 218.29 A: and then h- how would you let how would they let them know i mean you couldn't talk to them so you just 

218.23 220.08 B: pretty much have to ignore them 

219.71 223.46 A: yeah and how would that work that wouldn't work real well 

222.06 224.54 B: yeah that would just make you a crappy person 

224.08 226.10 A: yeah yeah 

224.55 235.51 B: [laughter] so you're like changing your personality so you're being like a person who's rich and snobbish somebody that i don't like you know i don't like people like that so i would be turning into a person like that 

232.41 233.47 A: yeah 

235.20 236.23 A: yeah 

235.62 237.61 B: just to you know have money 

237.16 238.76 A: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

238.28 239.84 B: and that is kind of ah 

240.68 245.37 B: materialistic i mean some people would do that in a heartbeat but i couldn't do it 

241.80 242.72 A: yeah 

244.89 247.45 A: i think there like there was a movie 

247.56 255.19 A: oh what was it michael douglas or something where they offered the husband that money if he could spend one day 

251.27 252.13 B: (( oh )) 

255.07 261.48 B: oh that no the one with demi moore you mean where she she yeah and that t- that caused all kinds of problems 

256.92 258.73 A: yeah yeah yeah 

260.93 261.79 A: (( i )) 

261.89 264.52 A: did they get back together in the end eventually 

263.56 267.92 B: i think they did yeah but it was they had so much damage done to them 

264.71 265.80 A: yeah 

268.25 271.43 B: and they really did end up losing like all the things that they treasured 

271.37 272.61 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

271.85 273.60 B: (( so it was like a really )) 

273.66 282.20 B: a strange because she started hanging around and it caused problems in the relationship you know it was all these things that no one expected and they disagreed on it in the beginning in 

281.73 282.68 A: yeah 

283.17 294.93 B: fact i think he encouraged her to do it because they were like they were in financial debt and they needed money and i don't know it was really it was a bizarre movie but it did show you what that money what kind of problems that money ah 

291.79 292.80 A: yeah 

296.02 301.48 B: [sigh] presented itself after a while and then that million dollars is really nothing and it was a million 

301.90 306.68 A: yeah you know they i don't they say a million dollars isn't what it used to be 

301.97 303.12 B: exactly 

306.63 315.41 B: right but even if it was ten million i mean geeze i mean yeah by the time you put that million [mn] get that million taxed it's like three hundred thousand dollars 

314.58 315.45 A: uh-huh 

315.50 321.64 B: so it really isn't that much but but i wouldn't even look at it that way as much as what it would do to your relationship 

323.12 324.90 B: (( so [sigh] )) 

325.07 327.16 B: so i guess we have to keep discussing huh 

326.99 329.63 A: yeah how'd you find out about this 

329.75 335.65 B: ah on the internet actually it was on some newsgroup and somebody was ref- you know 

331.30 332.54 A: yeah me too 

335.74 339.56 B: i think if you put your referral number in or something you can you know 

339.82 341.21 B: (( i don't know but it was some )) 

341.39 346.37 B: anyway i just kind of went on the site and looked at it and it are you from pennsylvania 

345.71 346.96 A: mhm 

346.40 348.16 B: yeah so am i [laughter] 

347.60 348.98 A: oh where do you live

352.06 355.87 B: (( it's ah right outside of philadelphia it is )) 

355.26 356.20 A: oh 

356.27 358.32 B: oh southwest of philly 

357.99 359.18 A: oh i live

361.92 362.89 B: oh okay 

365.05 369.62 B: oh i know exactly where that is because i used to drive my son up to um 

370.00 376.22 B: [lipsmack] ah a boy scout camp and we'd have to go through bath we'd take the back roads it's nice up that way 

373.33 374.05 A: (( mm ))

378.40 384.63 B: oh gosh i'd love that i would love to get out of this area [laughter] we're like right near philly it's so congested around here 

385.11 386.77 A: i believe it 

386.21 398.39 B: yeah i mean you know it's funny because you don't even know places like that exist when you're so close to the city and we don't you know in pennsylvania you think philadelphia suburbs and then as you drive up you see that 

393.85 394.84 A: mhm 

398.53 400.77 B: and it's like wow it's nice [laughter] 

400.18 404.93 A: yeah we live um we lived in the washington d._c. area and then we moved 

405.86 406.97 A: this way 

405.95 409.19 B: what bet your cost of living's a lot lower now 

408.42 410.82 A: (( oh yeah yeah the t- )) 

410.05 412.47 B: i mean our insurance is ridiculous around here 

412.42 414.40 A: it is totally different here 

414.04 420.30 B: oh yeah now that's my that's my goal is to move out of this you know this area someday soon 

419.95 420.83 A: (( mm )) 

420.53 423.63 B: and go into a less populated area 

422.77 426.15 A: matter of fact it it's kind of funny because my best friend 

425.20 425.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

426.07 439.31 A: she and i have been friends for a lot of years and my husband and i are both in the restaurant business so we were together when we lived in the washington d._c. area and for like twenty years we've been moving around with different restaurants 

439.30 442.33 A: and she kind of follow- has kind of followed us 

441.74 443.03 B: well that's kind of cool 

442.82 448.44 A: well now matter of fact they just moved to to florida and and i don't want to go to florida 

448.18 449.96 B: right i don't blame you 

449.03 456.01 A: so the relationship we've had is now it's long distance so it's kind of it's kind of changed 

455.56 456.95 B: right 

456.98 459.01 B: that's tough yeah 

459.19 462.09 A: so and i'm i really miss her [mn] 

459.22 460.61 B: that's kind of tough 

461.39 463.84 B: yeah well maybe she'll come back 

463.62 465.00 A: (( yeah nah )) 

464.40 467.77 B: florida's kind of congested well certain parts are 

466.11 471.32 A: yeah [noise] yeah and and i just i don't think i like the climate down there 

471.45 473.59 B: yeah oh i don't it's totally humid 

473.37 474.36 A: yeah 

473.90 475.01 B: yeah 

474.46 480.27 A: so with the the million dollars i'm missing her now [laughter] 

479.12 483.11 B: yeah well see there you go you don't even have to have the million dollars to miss her so 

482.45 483.54 A: yeah 

483.20 486.95 B: so the there you go there is like the whole answer right there that 

486.07 488.14 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

487.05 490.68 B: that that million dollars eventually will go away but then what would you do 

491.09 497.16 A: yeah and i wonder how if there would be stipulations if i couldn't be friends with her for five years 

496.93 499.85 B: right well it sounds like there's no stipulation 

499.50 500.86 A: [laughter] 

499.87 505.88 B: it's kind of like that did you ever see the movie easy money with rodney dangerfield i think he has to give up ah 

503.35 504.36 A: uh-huh 

506.01 514.54 B: drinking smoking and swearing like all those bad habits and then he gets i think he gets a million dollars from his uncle or somebody that dies 

508.56 509.59 A: [laughter] 

509.64 510.70 A: yeah 

514.41 515.57 A: yeah 

514.96 517.93 B: (( i don't even remember if he gets it at the end i know he has a )) 

517.66 518.36 A: [cough] 

518.53 523.48 B: he has like a i think he does i think he does but i don't remember i have a movie 

520.33 521.22 A: [noise] 

524.73 527.91 B: [laughter] um i haven't seen it in a while 

527.50 528.76 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

528.09 542.95 B: but it's the same deal i mean you but that's different because i mean that's stuff that you can get rid of it's that's to your benefit but having a best friend getting rid of them is it's not like you can go out and find another best friend you know it's not like you can go shopping for a best friend 

539.31 540.25 A: yeah 

542.09 547.34 A: and w- we've even we've been we've never even had a fight or anything like that 

546.75 547.93 B: that's awesome 

548.16 550.06 A: got angry at one another 

550.50 562.91 B: yeah i mean i've i've had a best friend for many years too and and even like we live close by and we're just both so busy we don't talk to each other but we know we can pick up the phone and you know and talk to each other when we need to and 

562.28 564.26 A: yeah and a mo- yeah 

563.68 567.31 B: you know we're sometimes real hard to get a hold of or something but 

567.39 577.50 B: you know just when it comes down to it i know she's there for me and [laughter] there's no amount of money that can replace that um i would have to definitely say no no no what do 

573.19 574.54 A: yeah 

577.16 578.31 A: (( [mn] no )) 

577.79 581.70 B: we do when it do they do they say anything about the ten minutes being up 

581.52 583.99 A: no i haven't heard anything yet i guess so 

583.21 586.09 B: yeah i guess somebody's listening in 

586.57 588.85 A: yeah i think they said they monitor the call 

588.55 589.60 B: right 

590.14 591.38 B: yeah 

590.79 594.66 A: now the thing is am i going to get i'm i'm waiting to see if we get our money 

595.99 598.00 B: yeah i'm not sure how that works 

598.22 599.89 B: (( i don't know [noise] )) 

599.27 599.89 A: i guess the
