3.45 5.12 B: hi gregory [laughter] 

4.46 5.55 A: how are you 

5.18 7.07 B: i'm fi- how are you today 

6.62 7.86 A: i'm okay 

7.33 12.84 B: i am so impressed with the ah the title today or the this week's topic of discussion 

12.62 15.25 A: uh-huh very interesting 

14.58 19.06 B: [laughter] a million bucks in exchange for my best friend huh 

18.78 19.88 A: uh-huh 

19.89 22.70 B: i don't even know if i have to think about that [laughter] 

22.00 26.04 A: yeah um i probably wouldn't do it 

25.49 31.12 B: yeah i well i know i wouldn't if i [laughter] i i could never imagine [laughter] i 

26.92 28.98 A: (( yeah )) 

31.38 39.23 A: it just wouldn't be worth it in the end i think i mean a a million dollars c- will go in a couple of years but your best friend's gonna be around forever 

36.78 37.81 B: yeah 

38.71 47.45 B: exactly your best friend is your best friend and they they'll do more for you and they'll you know technically speaking if you wanted to get technical on it y- you could always you know 

47.47 62.27 B: make your best friend last way more than a million dollars you know if you need something twenty years from now you could go call your best friend and they could do it for you but by then you might be broke out of that million bucks so who knows you could be sitting at home and hungry and nothing to eat and nobody [laughter] to cook it 

49.90 50.69 A: oh 

60.16 61.22 A: yeah 

61.27 63.88 A: and your best friend can always just bring you your food 

63.58 64.91 B: exactly 

64.04 65.73 A: [laughter] 

65.28 68.14 B: [laughter] so who needs delivery [laughter] 

66.95 70.25 A: yeah um [lipsmack] i i 

70.49 74.28 A: i don't think there's a question at all when it really comes down to it because 

72.24 73.23 B: yeah 

74.36 79.76 A: your best friend like my best friend personally has been arou- i've i've had them for like nine years 

79.94 89.07 A: and like they're gonna be with ah with me for the rest of my life and i can make a million dollars in my lifetime 

84.20 85.06 B: yeah 

87.92 101.83 B: exactly i know i yeah i know i feel you on that one 'cause i my best friend you know we've been for four years and i couldn't imagine trading anything in exchange for a friendship as good as your best friend you know that's why they are your best friend i mean 

98.81 100.02 A: yeah 

101.73 105.86 A: you can make a million dollars but you can't always make another best friend 

105.28 115.17 B: exactly i mean a million dollars isn't going to go out with you and get really wasted and do things you regret the next morning [laughter] that's what best friends are for 

111.12 113.58 A: i know [laughter] 

114.44 118.58 A: uh-huh and to pick up the pieces when they all fall down 

118.15 129.41 B: exactly [laughter] all a million dollars will do is sit in the corner and collect dust [laughter] i wonder how many people have said ah yes to this or have have considered exchanging their best friend for a 

121.82 123.22 A: yep 

129.53 130.91 B: a million bucks [laughter] 

130.61 132.55 A: i hope not a lot 

132.22 133.79 B: (( [laughter] me too )) 

134.25 144.32 B: but i guess ah since it's supposed to be hypothetically speaking what would i- is there any thing that a million dollars could persuade me to do such a thing i can't even imagine 

144.48 148.34 B: what i could do with a million bucks that would even make me reconsider 

148.63 151.57 B: um if i would give my best friend up 

151.26 154.67 A: i i i can't think of anything at all 

153.35 154.22 B: i mean 

154.28 158.40 B: whether it was by my own personal island or 

158.48 163.36 B: i don't know play the lottery a million times and win a million more times i can't even think of 

163.57 170.39 B: a but a unknown benefactor that makes me a fishy as well ah who's who's this random unknown benefactor 

167.09 168.15 A: yeah 

169.79 175.91 A: [laughter] and why would they c- why would they want to ruin your the friendship with your best friend [laughter] 

173.21 178.25 B: [laughter] exactly unknown benefactor huh hm 

176.64 177.87 A: yeah 

178.02 179.91 A: something to me 

179.36 191.48 B: yeah [laughter] it's like what's going on here what at that point i'd probably get very worried about my best friend [laughter] what have you done this time [laughter] somebody just offered me a million bucks not to talk to you 

185.67 187.07 A: yeah 

188.22 189.55 A: [laughter] 

191.52 201.70 B: but ah oh i i feel i feel silly i don't know what could possibly i mean i already know that i would never do it she'll be proud to hear it too i i'd have to call her and tell her after this 

201.15 206.47 A: yeah you won you won over a million bucks you're worth more to me than a million dollars [sigh] 

203.99 204.90 B: yeah 

205.48 212.34 B: exactly i'll say somebody ah theoretically speaking today hypothetically speaking wanted to know if i'd give you up for a million bucks 

212.38 214.15 B: and i said heck no 

214.34 215.66 B: [laughter] 

214.77 220.45 A: what if they what if the the anon benefactor raised raised the bounty what if it was ten million 

220.74 222.29 B: i i can't you know 

222.26 233.12 B: whether it's a million or ten million to somebody like me it's all becomes the same big number that i just say no to like trying to even get my brain to fathom one million versus ten million 

226.61 227.77 A: uh-huh 

233.10 246.01 B: is incomprehensible like i just don't get it because i don't have ah ten million dollars or a million so with trying to get a feel for the difference maybe if somebody took a million and put it on a table 

237.73 238.86 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

245.95 252.94 B: on one side of the room and then ten million and put it on the table on the other side of the room and then my best friend in the middle [laughter] you know 

252.95 266.71 B: maybe at that point i would feel awkward and be s- like feel like maybe paranoid about being persuaded but i still don't imagine myself doing it but ah i wonder what ten million dollars looks like sitting on the table in the corner 

261.92 262.98 A: (( yeah i )) 

265.84 267.71 A: wonder how tall it would be [laughter] 

267.37 270.33 B: yeah exactly [laughter] 

270.54 278.87 B: that to me is ah much more interesting than trying to decide if i should give my best friend up for it and what about like let's say it was a what what's after ten million what 

278.11 279.38 A: a hundred million 

279.02 284.06 B: a hundred million what if we were as rich as the richest person in the u._s. right now 

284.59 287.24 B: no [sigh] no i don't i don't think i'd do it 

285.38 286.61 A: huh 

287.00 288.75 A: i don't think i could 

288.43 292.77 B: who is that anyway bill gates right yeah yeah i don't i definitely don't think that i could do it 

289.67 291.00 A: yeah 

292.63 294.42 A: and he has a couple of billion 

294.54 296.89 B: yeah a couple a bill- even for a couple of billion 

296.68 298.35 A: i don't think i could 

297.81 302.73 B: it's like selling your soul to the devil or something i don't know [laughter] if there is such a thing [laughter] 

299.55 300.63 A: yeah 

301.09 303.45 A: i mean what would you do with that much money 

303.25 310.22 B: ah yeah maybe maybe i would do it if okay this is the only condition that maybe i would do it what if the unknown benefactor 

310.08 319.23 B: gave me a million or ten million and i gave my best fr- up friend up but in exchange they had to agree to sell her back to me for five hundred thousand [lipsmack] 

319.10 320.18 A: (( huh [noise] )) 

319.89 320.82 B: (( see [lipsmack] )) 

320.93 333.54 B: and i'd gladly pay them you know what a small perc- a a fee of some sorts but i you know i would have to make a profit on it at this point maybe if there was a lot of small writing you know and i could get my own attorney's and have them put it in there that 

330.22 331.31 A: yeah 

331.58 332.66 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

333.36 342.17 B: after the whole process you know within three days they had to sell her back to me the rights to her back to the rights to my best friend i never thought i'd say such a thing [laughter] 

341.34 343.47 A: (( [noise] yeah ah )) 

342.62 345.14 B: but um see that's the only condition 

345.06 347.13 A: there's some some kind of loop hole 

347.24 348.34 B: exactly 

347.38 349.86 A: yeah maybe there would be 

350.01 357.31 B: yeah if i could do that now [laughter] so there we go i've been persuaded [laughter] to sell my best friend 

351.89 353.39 A: [laughter] 

356.20 359.95 A: [noise] i i wouldn't yeah i would sell then rebuy 

359.84 362.87 B: and rebuy exactly it's like the stock market right 

362.22 363.36 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

362.94 366.58 B: but she doesn't gain any value [laughter] 

364.13 368.27 A: [laughter] well you could you could of course split it with her 

368.19 372.51 B: there you go yeah she would probably want some part of it too i'm sure 

368.78 369.98 A: [laughter] 

371.70 373.46 A: (( yeah )) 

372.70 377.10 B: can't just go selling the rights to my friend without her expecting something in return [laughter] 

376.73 377.95 A: [noise] of course 

377.93 380.75 B: but ah i wonder if she would sell me [laughter] 

381.03 384.01 A: huh i don't think my i don't think mine would 

383.54 387.33 B: you don't think your best friend would sell you for ten million bucks or a million bucks 

384.77 385.73 A: (( uh-uh )) 

386.82 389.52 A: nope i don't think i don't think she would 

388.19 390.69 B: are you gonna call after this and find out [laughter] 

389.90 394.81 A: mhm i'm gonna her for lunch in about twenty minutes and i'll ask her [laughter] 

393.67 394.49 B: there 

394.63 400.66 B: [laughter] like by the way by any chance would you consider giving me up for a million bucks [laughter] 

400.98 404.98 B: no no ah yeah it's it's like somebody asking i mean even if it was just my pet 

405.48 407.37 A: [laughter] oh no way 

405.95 408.14 B: i wouldn't do it yeah 

408.16 409.35 B: just can't do it 

409.27 410.25 A: (( uh-uh [noise] )) 

409.85 413.77 B: but ah i imagine there are some people out there who said heck yeah [laughter] 

414.77 416.96 B: i mean the numbers have to be high 

416.83 420.24 A: the bond is too just too great 

419.84 420.94 B: yeah 

420.97 423.06 A: you would live the rest of your life 

423.58 425.48 A: you know what if 

424.45 426.88 B: yeah yeah what if what if 

425.98 427.49 A: i messed up 

427.62 432.05 B: yeah and and all ten million dollars would do or a million dollars should do is get me in trouble anyway 

431.60 432.64 A: uh-huh 

432.23 440.30 B: it'd be horrible then i'd need a best friend and not have one [laughter] somebody come pull me out of jail [laughter] i don't know something crazy would happen 

440.79 445.81 A: the worst part is is that like some people actually give their best friends up for like say 

446.03 447.40 A: someone they're dating 

447.14 453.78 B: oh god oh yes exactly there are people like that who i bet are entering opposite responses to this 

450.45 451.29 A: (( [noise] )) 

453.85 463.99 B: the people who want to see somebody but maybe or they sleep with somebody's boyfriend or girlfriend or something like that and then it's a feud and it's all over [lipsmack] nah see 

459.99 461.07 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

464.01 472.64 B: we don't care well you get to a point in your friendship with your friends where whether it's money girls guys anything it doesn't matter [laughter] 

464.90 465.88 A: [laughter] 

471.50 473.29 A: yeah totally 

473.27 476.20 B: so i think with a million versus ten million i guess 

477.37 482.24 A: i mean i'd i'd rather have a million dollars then a one night stand [laughter] 

477.38 478.24 B: but 

480.59 484.78 B: yeah yeah exactly or even if it was a a one year relationship 

484.86 489.50 B: you know what i mean it's like you'd rather have a a friend for ever than 

485.61 486.59 A: uh-huh 

489.86 492.45 B: somebody who you hit it with for a while or whatever 

491.44 492.81 A: yeah 

493.03 494.02 B: so 

494.04 498.49 B: i guess i'll have to oh i can't even call my best friend right now i just realised that 

498.28 499.75 A: oh that's terrible 

498.86 509.69 B: as she doesn't have a million bucks or a phone [laughter] maybe i should do it and give half the money to her [laughter] well yeah i guess that's another stipulation what if they offered for us not to speak anymore for ten million 

500.65 501.96 A: [laughter] 

503.80 504.77 A: [laughter] 

509.91 513.50 B: and they gave to one person and half to the other 

512.51 513.87 A: (( hm )) 

515.72 516.60 B: (( hm )) 

516.62 518.09 A: i wouldn't do it 

517.49 526.47 B: yeah that's still still a big no for me too but it's nice it's funny to think about what the different situa- and now i'm going to be thinking about this all day it's gonna be very awkward [laughter] 

522.73 523.73 A: yeah 

527.77 534.75 A: [laughter] it's what what can buy me in this in in what does a certain situation what how much money would it take for me to do this 

534.20 535.51 B: exactly 

534.83 538.16 A: or not do this oh yeah i'll be thinking about it all day 

536.11 537.39 B: exactly 

538.15 541.13 B: putting a price tag on everything we know [laughter] 

540.34 541.32 A: uh-huh 

541.41 544.67 B: (( [laughter] i i don't know if that's healthy [laughter] )) 

543.19 545.08 A: [laughter] 

544.77 551.31 B: um yeah well i i guess the answer's definitely no i would definitely not ah give up the rights to 

551.79 553.37 B: my best friend and 

553.62 558.70 B: calling at wee hours of the night and waking people up for a a measly million bucks 

556.28 557.62 A: yeah 

558.82 559.70 B: [laughter] 

559.14 562.40 A: yeah [laughter] million buckses come and go but friends here to stay 

562.19 563.36 B: exactly 

563.46 565.02 B: friends are forever 

565.33 566.69 B: (( friends are forever )) 

566.54 567.60 A: uh-huh 

567.18 568.32 B: but um 

568.86 569.68 B: so 

569.88 570.81 B: yeah 

571.08 572.29 B: [laughter] 

571.24 573.13 A: ha- have you done this before 

572.56 574.96 B: yes i have one time [laughter] 

573.89 576.24 A: one time this is my first time 

575.35 580.26 B: oh really the first time it was very it there was a topic that was actually discussable 

580.06 581.75 A: oh really what was it 

580.44 589.58 B: it it was oh i don't even remember i just remember the guy and me we we we very much so had strong opinions about it but differentiated here and there 

582.27 583.24 A: [laughter] 

587.82 588.87 A: (( oh )) 

589.51 599.95 B: but i immediately knew that i wouldn't sell my best friend for a million bucks immediately i would never give up the rights to my drinking buddy and my wake me up in the middle of the night when i have to wake up at five the next day i'm gonna 

592.44 593.67 A: (( yeah huh ))
