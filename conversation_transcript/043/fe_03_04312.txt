48.45 49.77 B: (( mhm )) 

49.07 51.35 A: but i think i'd do better in school 

51.18 52.40 B: yeah 

51.72 52.96 A: because um 

53.09 59.05 A: yeah your options are limited when you haven't done as well as you your potential [mn]

71.29 72.64 A: stuff like that 

72.28 74.33 B: yeah um 

75.25 83.56 B: now i think i think you don't realize how important things like that are when you're younger um 

82.43 83.27 A: right 

83.70 86.99 B: but you're still young [laughter] 

85.67 89.16 A: right and ten thousand dollars in credit card debt 

88.71 91.00 B: yeah [laughter] 

91.18 92.16 B: um 

92.57 96.92 B: ah i don- i think i would have went back to school 

96.99 104.95 B: and i would have probably not got married as young not had kids as young i love my kids i'm glad i had them 

101.23 102.15 A: mhm 

105.24 110.30 B: but i th- if i would have went through school before i had my kids 

110.04 111.69 A: when did you have kids 

111.39 114.42 B: um well i had my son when i was nineteen 

114.49 116.60 A: so you didn't get to finish all of college 

116.41 117.67 B: (( no un-uh )) 

118.43 122.92 B: no i didn't go to coll- i'm trying to go to college now i never went to college then 

123.28 128.43 B: and i just ah i matter of fact i went all the way to my junior year 

128.63 129.69 B: and 

129.75 132.97 B: i ended up dropping out of high school so 

132.92 134.72 A: (( do you have your g._e._d. now [mn] )) 

133.78 141.32 B: yeah yeah i did i went back and got my ged i tried to finish school but i moved out of the house when i was young 

141.47 152.58 B: and i transferred all my records and the school that i went to wouldn't let me go there because i didn't live at home [laughter] but i was determined and i did get my g._e._d. 

148.30 149.57 A: oh wow 

151.86 153.10 A: well good for you 

153.08 159.54 B: but ah then i had my kids and that kind of put things on hold for a while [laughter] 

157.73 160.08 A: right right as they always do 

163.05 163.63 B: (( [noise] )) 

163.70 164.64 B: um 

165.34 169.67 B: so you think you would have done better in school [laughter] 

167.90 172.37 A: yeah definitely paid more attention learned more things 

172.24 177.05 B: is there anything is there anything else that you think if you went back in time you would change 

176.78 178.04 A: (( i don't know )) 

178.36 179.89 B: it's hard to say 

178.44 186.09 A: probably like you know not going out that friday night and gotten in trouble you know with my mom like stupid things like that but 

186.82 192.97 A: um i do- i don't know it was just um i think that's most important because if you do well in school then 

193.39 199.68 A: things later on in life are a little bit easier but you know not totally easier but you know you have more options 

195.53 196.66 B: yeah 

199.19 202.59 B: yeah you d- you definitely have more options 

201.82 206.62 A: so that i think that was ah that that's the big one for me i guess mhm 

206.32 210.93 B: yeah i guess i don't i i guess i 

211.46 214.41 B: i should have went to school ah 

215.38 219.87 B: i have a lot of health problems i was born with spina bifida 

219.26 220.50 A: what is that 

220.21 221.10 B: (( ah )) 

221.73 227.40 B: it's it's a problem with your sp- ah spine your spinal cord 

226.74 227.99 A: mhm 

227.49 230.77 B: and so i wasn't supposed to have any kids but i did 

230.43 231.56 A: oh wow 

231.10 238.31 B: and a lot of people that have that have they can't walk or they have a lot of problems and i was really fortunate 

238.08 239.48 A: well good 

238.85 246.65 B: but i've done mostly factory work because i didn't have an education and that's really taken a toll on me now that i'm getting older 

243.21 244.09 A: (( right mhm )) 

246.92 253.03 B: and i think if i would have if i would have stayed in school and went to college and 

253.20 258.96 B: got a job that wasn't as hard on my body that i might not be going through some of the things i am now 

259.03 263.11 A: what do you think about like owning your own business and doing stuff like that 

263.25 270.93 B: no ah that's funny you asked that ah me and my husband we've been talking about maybe trying to pursue that um 

271.88 276.45 B: the question is is what kind of business would would you want you know 

276.07 278.87 A: well do you have a pen and piece of paper handy 

276.78 277.86 B: to open

358.47 359.88 A: they cut you off

391.22 391.91 B: (( [laughter] )) 

396.77 397.59 B: uh-huh 

397.41 401.03 A: i got to pay this credit card debt off you know because i was stupid and spent 

399.31 400.49 B: [laughter] 

401.13 403.17 A: all this money when i shouldn't have 

402.98 407.43 B: see that's another thing if you could go back in time and change you might want to change 

407.10 410.56 A: that's yeah that's another thing don't get a credit card 

407.60 409.02 B: (( [cough] )) 

409.04 409.96 B: (( learn )) 

410.33 415.56 B: yeah credit cards they're easy to get and they're hard to pay off 

414.72 420.46 A: you know what they are somebody somebody was really good they said they are ah they're loan sharks without the muscle 

420.06 420.82 B: yeah 

421.50 423.35 B: yeah you're exactly right 

422.20 425.65 A: is who why are you going to give a college student who makes 

425.66 431.42 A: two hundred dollars every six months you know a five thousand dollar credit limit 

431.43 433.49 B: yeah 

432.60 441.19 A: you know it's just putting that kid in the store in a toy store going yeah you can't have anything but feel free to run around and look like what is that 

439.50 440.63 B: yeah 

440.63 453.96 B: i i have i would think they do that to college students becau- they target mostly younger college students i guess they figure that if your parents have the money to send you to college they have the money to pay off your debt 

453.10 454.72 A: exactly 

453.96 455.77 B: [laughter] 

454.89 460.57 A: exactly but it's i still think it yeah so that that's definitely one thing i would go back and change 

460.21 461.28 B: yeah 

460.68 465.70 A: i'd keep you know just one credit card five hundred dollar limit and that is it 

465.44 466.79 B: yeah 

465.91 475.63 A: that is it i make like as a college student like working campus jobs and stuff do you know how much i make a month two hundred dollars two hundred dollars a month could you imagine that 

472.37 473.22 B: mm 

475.26 476.23 B: geesh 

476.04 480.15 A: we did my taxes i made like eighteen hundred dollars for the year 

479.78 480.65 B: mm 

480.56 483.19 A: it's like what is that [laughter] 

481.95 482.79 B: yeah 

483.69 489.52 B: yeah i wish if i if i could go back in time and know what i know now 

489.61 491.13 B: i would be set 

491.02 493.60 A: yeah that's what everybody says that's why 

493.66 500.79 A: you've got to get educated so you can learn from anybody can learn from their own mistakes but it's learning from other people's mistakes that makes you wiser 

500.29 511.10 B: yeah well well i h- what i've been told is it's only a mistake if you don't learn something from it and if you learn something from it then you've gained something and it's valuable 

506.13 507.23 A: there you go 

510.48 511.44 A: right 

511.44 525.79 A: and you've just got to share that with e- everybody you can so that hopefully like you know the mistakes that you've made hopefully you know you i'm sure you've taught your children right and things like that and hopefully they won't make the same mistakes you you did so that they can have a better life 

520.10 522.09 B: (( yes mhm )) 

525.33 527.01 B: yep i tell them 

525.88 527.80 A: things like that right 

527.27 537.04 B: i tell them you're going to school whether you want to or not and you're going to college whether you want to or not [laughter] you'll thank me for it later [laughter] 

530.42 531.54 A: (( oh good )) 

533.21 534.29 A: good 

535.09 543.72 A: exactly like when i wish my mom was more you know forceful about me and the credit card and stuff like that because i wouldn't be in this situation right now 

543.38 545.39 B: yeah 

544.36 548.14 A: yeah so that's just another thing to go back in time 

548.15 553.88 B: [lipsmack] i i guess you try to teach you try to teach your kids the right way but sometimes 

553.62 555.39 A: they just have to learn on their own 

553.95 556.22 B: sometimes they have to learn on their own 

555.73 557.28 A: yeah that's right 

556.27 558.75 B: and they're better people for it later 

558.06 560.76 A: right because they have that life experience 

560.25 562.21 B: mhm 

561.40 564.44 A: and it's getting that life experience early on [laughter] 

563.99 565.19 B: yeah 

564.65 567.16 A: so you can use it later on as well 

567.07 572.61 B: oh i- if i could go back now another thing i would do is i would have stayed at home 

572.59 586.08 B: as long as i could have i would have stayed with my dad and i would have saved my money and i would have bought real estate while i was living at my dad's let it pay for itself and it would have all been paid for now 

577.78 578.62 A: yeah 

580.29 582.42 A: [laughter] 

582.52 584.47 A: yeah that's right 

585.63 588.11 A: that would be good yeah that's right 

586.71 587.54 B: yeah 

587.56 589.12 B: yeah 

588.41 591.11 A: and then just collecting rent every month huh 

590.62 599.95 B: yeah yeah at least you know that would be that would be one way to generate revenue even and you don't think about stuff like that then but i would have had a house already when i 

591.30 593.21 A: yeah that'd be perfect
