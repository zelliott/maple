102.66 109.20 B: twenty years but i have other friends i would consider best friends so 

110.54 119.14 B: i think in a same situation that i am being offered a million dollars there would be an offer of a million dollars i think they would do it too 

120.17 125.27 A: what about the ah people who claim that their best friend is their wife 

126.31 127.32 B: um 

127.44 130.36 A: would you not i don't know if you've heard it or not but mhm 

128.37 140.17 B: well that best friend that i i could i could say that i was real close to like that he's deceased so that would never come to play with me so i wouldn't have any problems doing that 

142.61 143.67 A: (( okay mm )) 

143.29 150.44 B: well they said that you would have to stop being friends but they didn't say anything about you couldn't say hello

176.33 178.12 B: that's still a lot of money too 

178.27 182.28 B: but i would think about it for a hundred thousand dollars 

178.70 180.39 A: mhm 

185.08 188.15 B: a million dollars is a lot of money 

189.05 191.25 A: it reminds me of a joke this ah 

191.16 195.35 A: these people at a dinner party one of them talks to one of the women

216.90 226.54 B: well there was a movie indecent proposal have you ever seen it where the where the guy offered to have sex with the guy's wife for a um 

220.99 221.86 A: mhm 

226.31 235.50 B: the money so you know those case scenarios do happen and you know money as they say 

231.73 233.09 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

235.85 240.62 B: is a temptation and a lot of people can't turn down a million dollars

250.35 255.55 B: yeah i can i can understand that so 

255.34 269.12 B: it's m- a majority of people if you don't have that kind of money i mean if you're a superstar making like ten twenty million dollars a movie or something like that well you can say yeah okay but your everyday person 

269.15 273.78 B: like we are you can't you're not going to turn a million dollars down 

273.68 274.57 A: (( no )) 

276.00 279.75 A: besides you never know when your best friend's going to end up sleeping with your wife or 

278.94 281.11 B: [laughter] 

280.46 282.24 A: rat you out to the feds or 

282.05 287.33 B: or who's to say if um the best friend wasn't offered a million dollars to do the same thing to you 

287.26 288.98 A: mhm 

287.86 289.26 B: you would never know 

290.71 297.09 B: because if why would they stipulate that you have to stop being friends with your best friend 

297.13 303.89 B: maybe they made the same deal to your best friend to see if he would do it he or she would do it to you 

309.12 310.86 A: mhm that's right 

310.65 318.64 B: but like i said the person that i considered my best friend he's deceased he's you know he passed away so

338.89 345.79 B: your um family a best friend is someone you can confide in when you can't confide in anybody else 

341.08 342.23 A: right 

345.86 348.53 B: a best friend is there for you when you need someone 

349.84 352.46 B: [cough] a best friend is a person that you can 

352.98 365.63 B: go and tell him things that you know they're going to keep a secret you can't just consider everyone a best friend so you know that that i don't i don't think i have a problem with it because 

365.69 373.35 B: i don't really have a best friend anymore i have friends but so i think i i would take the million dollars 

373.55 375.96 B: with no doubt i would take the million dollars 

379.02 379.67 A: (( mm )) 

379.50 380.98 B: do

381.98 382.91 B: yeah 

382.31 383.19 A: (( ah )) 

384.33 387.40 A: in that case that the guy i've known since college and it 

387.43 389.37 A: fits with everything you said if 

388.63 390.35 B: mhm 

390.13 393.75 A: they were to tell me that you can't tell others but 

394.99 398.23 A: ah for that kind of money you know just hire a therapist 

398.69 409.21 B: [laughter] yeah for that kind of money you can um like you said you can buy a friend you could buy several friends 

406.58 407.52 A: mhm 

409.29 415.68 B: now would it be a problem with you like do you have a best friend that you it'd be hard for you to give up for a million bucks 

415.99 417.23 A: (( um )) 

417.32 419.05 A: the case is with him 

418.09 420.59 B: mhm 

419.72 422.74 A: is like he got married recently so 

422.27 423.15 B: uh-huh 

423.02 426.10 A: we spend less time together anyway he's always with his wife 

425.67 426.80 B: oh okay 

426.76 429.93 A: so i guess it's not that big of a deal to me anymore 

428.21 441.38 B: so it wouldn't be that big of a deal anymore yeah if it was someone that you would go out to a bar with and drink have a few beers and watch some sports together or something like that then it'd be something different 

431.42 432.25 A: mhm 

440.92 442.64 A: mhm 

441.68 442.87 B: yeah true 

443.48 446.70 B: well i guess we we both have the same um 

448.46 451.76 B: answer we both would take the million dollars 

451.87 454.84 B: and say bye to the best friend [noise] [noise] 

454.49 456.24 A: mhm 

461.51 463.26 A: what if it was ah 

464.70 469.90 A: say they pay you a million dollars to be best friends with someone you despise mhm 

470.56 471.74 B: um 

472.40 474.32 B: i would do it 

475.29 478.59 B: because i don't really despise anybody 

479.32 485.53 B: i may dislike a person but i don't despise them because no matter how bad you dislike a person 

485.77 489.90 B: th- there's always ways to get around that 

489.03 490.73 A: what if it was saddam hussein 

490.91 492.33 B: saddam hussein 

492.41 498.88 A: yeah for a million dollars you have to hang out with saddam hussein every day and go drinking with him and tell him all your personal secrets 

496.07 497.84 B: [laughter] 

499.20 500.42 B: um 

503.23 505.33 B: i don't think that would ever happen

516.22 520.11 B: who would you consider um someone that you despise 

520.24 524.08 B: i mean would it be a famous person or 

524.76 526.57 B: just an everyday person 

524.88 528.73 A: mm yeah probably someone in that case like ah saddam hussein or 

527.53 530.07 B: mhm 

530.44 532.33 A: my ex-girlfriend
