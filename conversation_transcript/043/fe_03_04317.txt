16.57 17.56 A: um 

18.33 20.25 A: i guess ah 

21.03 24.55 A: ah if you had to change one thing about your life 

24.61 27.56 A: what would it be and why i guess that's the topic 

27.30 29.54 B: okay can i just tell you why 

29.48 30.91 A: yeah mhm 

30.04 31.47 B: okay um 

33.18 37.79 B: okay i guess if i could change one thing that's pretty easy i know what that would be um 

38.71 53.32 B: that was about when i was twenty one years old i was planning my wedding to my now husband who i've been married to for about five years um i decided i didn't want to have the big wedding that my parents and all my family wanted 

46.95 47.82 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

51.13 52.39 A: oh 

53.14 58.94 B: um you know big church wedding probably about two hundred guests it was catered everything like that 

58.47 59.64 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

59.04 71.28 B: um it was more important to me just to get married and i deci- and i decided that about four months before the actual wedding date so my husband and i took off with his best friend and my best friend who are married and eloped in las vegas 

64.71 65.75 A: oh 

71.39 73.48 B: but not wanting to 

73.68 81.20 B: disappoint our family we didn't tell them about it and we just hid it for four months and were going to go through with the actual 

81.23 82.78 B: wedding ceremony 

83.36 84.36 B: um 

85.33 92.41 B: it came out and i'm not sure how exactly but it came out about a week before the wedding 

92.42 93.84 B: and um 

94.06 100.26 B: i was at work at the time my parents called me told me about it that they had found out and um 

103.34 109.65 B: well basically ended up calling off the actual wedding part because we had eloped and i didn't want to make my parents go through that 

109.50 110.52 A: yeah 

109.74 122.53 B: so um we decided to still have the reception though so we called all of the guests which is around two hundred well my husband did mostly i i didn't have the strength to do it but luckily my husband did he called those and 

120.29 121.49 A: [laughter] 

122.57 130.82 B: told them that we had eloped but we were still having the reception that they could come to that and we still had all the everything was catered still the cake still and everything 

130.62 131.70 A: (( mhm )) 

131.08 135.02 B: um just in the form of a reception and not the wedding so 

135.68 138.84 B: i'm glad we did that but it was tough being there to 

139.09 151.15 B: to see all of them answer all their questions wanting to know why we got married for those of them that knew that um or why we eloped i'm sorry and for those of them that knew that we hid it for four months you know answering that question of why we did that 

150.57 152.26 A: [laughter] 

151.59 152.64 B: um 

153.78 158.64 A: i guess i c- i can understand that i never had a big wedding i'm thirty two 

158.76 162.58 A: and ah and that's something i've always thought about too 

162.62 170.77 A: um i guess if i could go back in time and change anything about my life i i think i would have stayed in school um 

170.23 171.43 B: mhm 

171.55 181.19 A: [lipsmack] i i didn't finish school i went back i quit my junior year went and got went and got my g._e._d. i had tried to finish school but 

181.71 185.84 A: i would have stayed and home and finished school and 

186.29 196.06 A: and i think i would have made better investments when i was younger because if i could go back i would i would hope i would get to keep all the knowledge that i have now 

196.17 208.60 A: [laughter] and ah because i i'm trying to go back to school now and it's it's a lot harder when you have two kids and a husband than it would have been you know back then 

196.65 198.19 B: (( mhm )) 

208.96 210.60 A: and um 

211.45 214.53 A: i was born with ah spina bifida so 

214.80 219.97 A: i've always done manufacturing jobs because of the lack of education 

220.53 221.99 A: and um 

222.22 225.42 A: and it's really took a toll on my body so 

226.54 239.81 A: i want to be around for my grandkids and my great grandkids and and i think if i would have took the education route instead of the manufacturing route that i'd probably be in a lot better shape today 

239.35 244.37 B: [laughter] uh-huh yeah did you have anything specific in mind that you wish you had pursued 

244.55 245.78 A: ah teaching 

245.89 247.31 A: english teacher 

245.95 248.00 B: oh yeah 

247.44 249.23 A: yeah 

249.59 251.11 A: but um 

251.13 252.23 A: i guess 

252.64 265.86 A: i don- there are so many things in your life that you could sit around all day and think well maybe i would go want to go back and change this but i think that would be the most important thing to me because it would be 

266.17 268.30 A: it would have probably changed 

268.40 273.15 A: you know it would have probably changed my life a lot made it a lot easier 

270.50 272.18 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

273.26 274.58 B: mhm 

275.28 279.46 A: [laughter] 

275.97 286.59 B: yeah my my the thing that i want to change in not having done it the way i did it ba- still getting married to my husband but not doing it that way i guess i want to change that just because 

283.76 285.55 A: yeah 

286.82 296.30 B: i disappointed so many people when i did that and you know friends and family that i've known for ever and they kind of felt betrayed and i guess that feeling of 

288.58 291.73 A: yeah yeah 

296.64 308.51 B: of having let them down has always stayed with me then i've never really gotten over that and i mean my parents don't push you know they don't say anything about it now but occasionally when i'm 

302.04 304.09 A: yeah and since 

306.71 307.70 A: yeah 

308.71 309.48 B: (( ah )) 

309.52 317.51 B: a friend of mine gets married or something and i'll talk about a wedding my mom will just say oh i would you know really rather you not talk about that [laughter] yeah 

315.05 316.72 A: not talk about it 

316.92 321.16 A: does it bother you sentimentally too that you wish that you would have 

321.24 324.68 A: had the the wedding dress and 

324.52 338.14 A: all the guests and the pictures and you know that if you have your own kids that you could have passed down the dress and does that bother you too or just the fact just the fact that you just disappointed so many people 

333.91 335.71 B: (( mhm well no )) 

337.66 345.09 B: to an extent i wish i did have all the pictures and i wish my family had been there but i would still have done it in las vegas but i would have made it 

345.06 356.70 B: different i would have had all my f- the two hundred people all going to las vegas i would have had you know worn the dress even though i just i mean i didn't wear a big white wedding dress like i wanted to and i would take a lot of pictures but 

356.49 360.45 B: i would still do it in las vegas and make it a much more casual affair 

360.26 361.79 A: yeah 

360.85 373.34 B: that would be my choice but you know including everybody which is why i think they were so upset because we didn't it was just my best friend my husband's best friend and and that was it and that was oh 

373.12 376.23 B: m- the most difficult thing hiding it for four months 

373.48 375.56 A: did you just [mn] 

375.85 385.81 A: yeah were you nervous were you nervous about being in a group of people that big or did you just want to hurry up and get married because you couldn't wait any longer or 

386.78 387.60 A: or 

386.87 392.69 B: it w- it d- it had just turned into such a monster affair i didn't even feel as though it was my 

393.34 397.87 B: wedding anymore i felt like i was doing it for everybody else yeah i 

394.23 396.45 A: you felt like everybody else was 

396.69 398.29 A: yeah 

398.01 407.35 B: guess i just wanted ownership of it i wanted to make it between me and my husband make it r- it had lost the romance it was just this stressful thing that we were doing in a couple of months 

407.01 410.73 A: it was more like work than something that was enjoyable 

408.43 410.11 B: mhm 

410.18 411.82 B: yeah 

411.72 414.87 A: yeah i can understand that 

414.91 416.68 A: (( but hm )) 

416.16 418.74 B: [laughter] so i mean hopefully that 

419.77 427.89 B: it will we have an anniversary plan where we're going to back to las vegas on the five year our five year anniversary and i've actually been thinking a lot about that and how 

428.02 436.18 B: maybe after five years i can try and at least finally try to to put that to rest and not let that nag at me anymore 

435.32 444.38 A: [noise] yeah it's har- it's hard when you feel like it's hard when you feel like you've disappointed people and i and that's one thing i 

442.45 443.36 B: (( mhm )) 

444.81 450.71 A: i wish i would have stayed at home at my dad with my dad and finished school um 

450.87 454.98 A: i had moved with my mom which was a mistake 

454.94 456.03 B: mhm 

455.37 456.38 A: um 

456.97 460.34 A: i know that sounds bad but you just have to know my mom but 

460.47 461.49 A: um 

462.13 471.23 A: they i really disappointed him in that because um i was i was i always did well in school and he always thought that i would 

471.16 478.72 A: stay and go to college and and make something of myself because he worked in manufacturing and he wanted better for me 

478.15 479.88 B: mhm 

478.99 481.47 A: and when i guess when you're young 

481.57 490.81 A: you don't think about the consequences of your ac- you know of your actions and how they're going to affect your family when you have a family 

490.62 491.59 B: yeah 

490.82 500.58 A: because you're not thinking of family you're thinking of of the here and now you don't most i don't i can't speak for everybody but a lot of young people 

500.61 503.81 A: they don't look towards the future 

503.82 506.55 A: they just look at what's right there in front of them 

506.71 511.58 A: and then when they get when they get my age they think man 

511.90 524.41 A: if i'd have only done i would have only done that and if i would have only thought about you know the future i have a step brother that lives with my dad now and ah he's twenty six 

524.60 533.68 A: and he works and lives there and i told him you know you're still young because he had went to school he was going to college and dropped out and i said 

533.71 539.96 A: you know i know you have a good job but you should really you know even if it's part time one day a week 

540.06 546.17 A: try to get you know your school because if something ever happened and you lost your job 

546.18 549.85 A: that you would always have that to fall back on and i tell him too 

549.87 552.17 A: with as much money as you're making 

552.24 558.03 A: even though that you're living in with dad you should you should look to buy a house 

558.06 571.33 A: and have it paid paid for rent it out while you're living with my dad and it will pay for itself and then when it's paid for if you go to get married you'll have a home it'll be paid for and you won't have to go through 

571.38 574.14 A: the struggle that some people have to go through 

573.85 575.70 B: mhm 

574.79 575.83 A: you know 

576.35 581.67 A: but i i think it's really important to plan for your future and that's one of the things 

581.78 584.01 A: i would change i would have definitely 

584.64 586.90 A: planned a little bit better for my future 

587.15 590.47 B: yeah but unfortunately hindsight's twenty twenty [laughter] 

590.13 591.42 A: yeah 

590.60 593.50 B: there's a lot of little things i know i would change but 

595.13 597.23 B: [sigh] but that was the major one 

597.10 598.39 A: (( yeah )) 

597.66 599.72 B: so you're in school now though
