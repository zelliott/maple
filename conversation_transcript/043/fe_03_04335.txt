0.00 2.09 B: i'm patricia from illinois 

1.59 3.80 A: i'm candy from kentucky 

4.70 5.88 B: okay 

7.86 8.41 B: (( ah )) 

7.95 9.88 A: oh what would you change 

10.17 17.84 B: [laughter] if i had an opportunity to change anything go back in time and change anything 

19.19 20.12 B: (( hm )) 

21.15 22.58 B: that's a good one 

24.00 29.65 B: i guess what i would have done was to continue my education 

29.96 32.32 B: um i went um 

32.39 34.26 B: i got a college degree 

34.39 37.67 B: and i went straight through and got my masters degree 

37.46 38.44 A: mhm 

37.82 40.55 B: and i wish i had gone ahead and 

41.19 51.79 B: gotten a phd and probably started my own business or got in my book got in gotten the book that i had ah written almost twelve years ago published 

52.12 54.53 B: and then i think i'd be further along 

54.76 63.14 B: as far as the publishing end of it because i wh- w- written a lot of small other books and i should have gotten my books published 

63.46 65.61 B: -a yeah and gone into that area more 

63.65 64.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

66.18 71.74 B: you know the marketing of the books and whatnot become a an author like i've always wanted to be 

71.80 73.59 B: beyond that um [lipsmack] what 

74.10 80.27 B: do you call it that book signing circuit and whatnot and promoting the books and whatnot i like that sort of thing 

77.01 77.70 A: (( hm )) 

80.43 82.41 B: i never pursued it 

82.89 84.77 A: (( [mn] maybe it's not too late )) 

83.28 85.66 B: not that it's too late [laughter] 

85.58 86.89 A: it's not too late 

87.72 94.04 A: i guess mine would be i would have waited to have my children and finish my educow- -cation out earlier than what i did 

94.56 99.68 A: because when i graduated i went ahead and had two of my kids then i went to school 

99.63 100.58 B: mhm 

99.98 105.72 A: and i kind of kick myself in the butt because i passed up a scholarship and 

105.82 108.26 A: it's one of those things and 

108.82 116.74 A: i went back and got my associates degree but that's as far as i've made it because with kids it's kind of hard to actually concentrate 

113.11 114.11 B: mhm 

117.49 119.94 A: so i wish i would have waited on that 

119.35 121.48 B: well it's not too late my um 

121.76 126.23 A: it just makes it harder i mean it's not impossible but it is a lot harder to do 

122.02 123.03 B: (( um m- )) 

125.73 128.47 B: yeah are they are they a re they still small 

128.12 129.54 A: mhm 

130.41 132.95 A: one's three one's five and one's seven [mn] yeah 

132.58 138.01 B: okay maybe you can take a a course a year or something a course a quarter or a course a semester 

139.12 142.53 A: because i was going and i was taking four classes a day 

139.24 142.54 B: because my my niece just my niece just finished 

142.71 143.71 B: um 

143.82 149.39 B: college and i looked at her mother and i said now it's time for you to go [laughter] 

149.10 150.24 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

149.61 153.38 B: or do something it's time for you to do something 

154.95 158.65 A: i think a lot of us have regrets though when it comes to education [mn] 

157.93 158.97 B: mhm 

159.75 172.96 B: that well because i have quite a few people in my choir who have gone back and who and who are going back you know to school after the kids have gotten like high school and whatnot you know they're going back for their degrees and whatnot 

173.26 175.15 B: so it's it's never too late 

175.22 176.02 A: (( no )) 

175.38 182.51 B: um i have a girlfriend who's going for a phd program she has a six year old so she takes a class here 

182.87 186.32 B: class there whatever you know 

186.27 187.66 A: (( mm yeah )) 

189.73 198.01 B: so it it's a rough thing going back to school i can't imagine going back and buckling down studying writing papers and whatnot 

192.39 193.25 A: yeah 

197.83 198.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

198.18 203.29 B: but eventually that is something i'm i'm going to have to look at and do too but you know ah 

204.23 207.13 B: i really want to get back into the you know get my 

208.50 212.87 B: get into getting my book published matter of fact today in the mail i got something on 

212.90 215.88 B: book publishing i'm like where did this come from 

215.77 216.72 A: [laughter] 

215.98 218.29 B: what is this all about [laughter] 

218.92 222.36 B: how did they get my name i'm like oh yeah i need to 

222.58 225.27 B: um get that book done 

227.40 228.07 A: hm 

227.95 229.21 B: you know i can 

230.29 234.17 A: maybe between that and this maybe you'll go back and finish it 

230.30 231.22 B: tar- 

233.72 234.48 B: hm 

234.29 239.34 A: i said maybe between that circumstance and then this discussion maybe you'll go back and finish it 

238.73 244.46 B: yeah so that that w- that book that was like out of the clear blue sky and i was like 

244.62 245.94 A: maybe it's a sign mhm 

245.29 251.63 B: who's list am i on and i look at the label there's no indication because it's like 

251.45 263.31 B: there's no little code or anything on like there's nobody on the label like on some magazine like if you and there was a certain way on one magazine subscription it's the same way on the other subscription nothing like that 

258.78 259.67 A: (( mhm )) 

263.31 264.00 A: hm 

263.51 268.97 B: like somebody had just like typed this label put it on this book and sent it to me so maybe that is something 

269.23 270.64 A: that is weird 

271.53 273.76 B: (( i was like that is )) 

274.43 275.15 B: but 

275.64 277.95 A: (( well hopefully you'll be able to finish your book )) 

277.85 278.99 B: mhm 

278.67 280.16 A: and get it published 

281.20 282.91 B: yeah i just need to 

283.45 288.43 B: check into things well i have got it co- copyrighted and everything i just need to 

288.73 294.42 B: um well you know the i was you know one thing is a lot of people like things on disk there's 

295.22 296.48 A: mhm 

295.72 300.95 B: [lipsmack] and i finally went back and retyped the entire thing again 

300.97 306.61 B: because i had it on a disk but i couldn't find it so i went through all the hassle of having it re 

306.96 309.65 B: typing the whole thing and then i had to trans- 

309.70 321.62 B: and i put it on a disk and i'm like but i didn't go any further with it because i was looking at it and said well maybe some of these chapters i need to rearrange i need to put them they're kind of like in the wrong order of things that i want so 

319.21 320.62 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

321.77 322.92 A: mhm 

324.34 326.91 B: that that's something to really look at 

327.13 328.10 A: yeah 

328.49 330.01 B: (( i might get that in my )) 

331.43 333.63 B: you know you never can um put off 

334.10 338.99 B: education long enough that's something that never kind of expires have expiration 

337.67 340.72 A: i don't think you ever can have enough education 

340.65 341.49 B: (( nn nn )) 

341.60 347.58 B: and and one thing was never have an expiration date on it you can go back at any time for that really 

347.64 348.60 B: you know [noise] 

347.80 349.47 A: yeah 

349.68 352.77 A: but you're better off if you get it all done at once 

352.69 360.14 B: mhm yeah ah if you if you can because my other sister i said well did you ever get your associate degree she was taking classes forever 

360.40 361.15 A: (( hm )) 

361.00 366.75 B: well she has really progressed up the ranks with the government so i'm telling her you need to 

368.26 372.20 B: go back and finish that one class you had to you know you had to take 

372.15 373.29 A: yeah 

372.63 373.99 B: and do something 

374.65 376.86 B: because you know education is important 

377.20 383.85 A: yeah i quit after my after i got my associate degree because my children was just getting a little bit too demanding so 

382.76 388.96 B: yeah and then you've got to be able to concentrate to do homework and whatnot and projects 

388.26 393.52 A: mm yes because the way i was doing it i was staying up until like three o'clock in the morning doing my work 

393.00 394.07 B: mhm 

394.19 397.82 A: and the hours i work now there's no way i could go back to school 

397.45 399.35 B: right and then with 

398.59 401.64 A: i work from like ten o'clock in the morning to almost midnight 

401.30 402.58 B: oh wow 

402.41 405.54 A: yeah i barely have enough time for my family 

404.86 406.70 B: do you get paid by the hour 

406.48 407.80 A: mhm 

407.16 411.57 B: good [laughter] n- not like salary like me so 

408.63 409.42 A: oh yeah 

410.91 411.93 A: oh no 

412.48 413.39 B: (( at least you )) 

412.61 414.50 A: i wouldn't go with a salary 

415.68 418.97 A: i mean if it was enough per year i probably would 

418.30 419.33 B: mhm 

419.19 420.03 A: but 

420.27 421.69 A: generally no 

422.24 423.26 B: mhm 

424.33 429.57 B: yeah because they're at the age once they start school you'll be doing homework and they'll be doing homework 

429.48 431.20 A: and dad'll work [laughter] 

431.40 432.47 B: mhm 

432.25 435.56 A: it's just getting them all in school [laughter] [laughter] 

434.12 435.63 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

435.63 439.47 A: because the one who's three years old there's no way i can do homework around him 

439.07 440.20 B: right 

439.99 442.75 A: because he is just into everything 

444.87 447.31 A: i don't think he has a minute he sits still 

447.65 448.79 B: mhm 

448.96 451.57 B: can't watch him and do homework you turn around 

450.65 451.81 A: oh no 

451.77 452.86 B: they're into 

451.98 455.19 A: well i can't watch him without doing homework 

454.42 455.66 B: [laughter] 

456.07 457.72 A: i ain't got enough eyes 

457.14 458.25 B: mhm 

458.60 459.72 A: he's just whew 

460.02 461.34 A: he is off the hook 

464.38 465.49 A: (( [mn] ah i don't know )) 

464.78 470.47 B: well so both of you need to concentrate in in give a what do you call it ah a plan 

470.49 471.73 A: yeah 

471.07 473.57 B: a long range plan 

473.20 474.59 A: yeah long term 

474.26 476.16 B: long term plan on how you 

476.21 479.40 B: how you implement you know your your goals 

479.29 480.39 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

479.68 483.14 B: but why are you doing this because maybe along the lines while you 

483.29 488.69 B: waiting you can just read a book in an area of interest on your own 

488.72 489.68 B: you know 

489.55 490.33 A: (( yeah )) 

491.14 492.12 B: like go to 

491.41 493.41 A: see i went to school for accounting 

493.29 494.28 B: okay 

495.01 497.55 A: so there's not much i can read on that [laughter] 

497.34 499.00 B: (( mm okay do )) 

498.41 500.73 A: that's kind of a hard subject to read on [laughter] 

500.92 502.21 B: you have a computer 

501.89 502.77 A: mhm 

502.45 504.44 B: (( why don't you do a tutorial or something )) 

504.21 506.10 A: yeah i do that all the time 

506.12 508.86 A: [mn] i take online classes 

508.24 509.40 B: (( oh okay )) 

510.46 512.55 A: just to like keep me up to date 

513.53 514.53 B: mhm 

514.04 515.62 A: but other than that 

516.12 519.25 A: i haven't really pursued my education like i'd like to 

518.06 519.05 B: yeah 

521.47 529.68 A: because i planned on having my own business by the time i was thirty and well [laughter] thirty's around the door from me [laughter] yeah 

521.49 522.21 B: y- 

528.98 533.96 B: mhm mhm we do make those plans [laughter] but 

533.16 537.19 A: i mean i've been interested in accounting since i was in like middle school 

537.13 538.04 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

537.86 540.46 A: and was taking classes when i was in high school 

540.60 543.85 A: for that taking business classes and stuff but 

545.02 548.69 A: had kids and well everything went out the door [laughter] 

550.92 553.79 A: so it's like one of my biggest regrets 

553.76 554.70 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

554.16 555.77 A: i think i should have waited 

556.95 559.18 A: and things would probably have been a lot better 

559.35 561.14 A: financially and everything 

563.34 565.69 A: i wouldn't struggle as much probably 

568.81 570.39 B: (( well once they're gone )) 

570.40 571.84 B: (( you'll you'll be )) 

572.87 576.24 B: (( they'll be out the door and you still won't be too bad )) 

576.09 577.10 A: yeah 

576.46 578.26 B: you know age wise 

577.94 579.70 A: yeah 

580.40 582.59 A: well i won't be too bad but [laughter] 

584.62 587.51 A: can't look forward enough to that day though [laughter] 

587.34 588.45 B: mhm 

589.29 593.39 A: have them out on their own where i don't have to sit there and be responsible for them 

593.25 594.30 B: mhm 

597.23 599.89 A: i think that day will never probably come [laughter]
