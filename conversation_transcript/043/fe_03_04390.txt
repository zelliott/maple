9.00 10.25 B: (( oh okay )) 

10.31 14.36 B: um can you hold on one second hold on [noise] 

12.53 13.61 A: (( sure [mn] )) 

30.47 31.53 B: hi randy 

31.22 32.04 A: hi 

32.75 36.62 B: how're you doing i just want to pick it up in the other room 

33.43 34.54 A: fine how are you 

36.42 38.41 A: so what do you think about that question 

38.36 40.88 B: i think it's an interesting question um 

40.94 47.60 B: it's it's kind of comical because i'm in the insurance and investment field 

47.03 47.94 A: uh-huh 

47.84 52.66 B: and i have clients who are well to do 

52.47 53.62 A: right 

53.02 63.23 B: and like i as a matter of fact tomorrow i'm going up ah to do ah some auto home owners and some investments with somebody who has like over three million dollars 

63.34 64.87 B: and um 

65.06 70.77 B: she's the type she left like three quarters of a million to a university 

70.44 72.13 A: wow that's a lot of money 

71.54 79.09 B: yeah so ah you know she's like seventy six years old so she you know like she's h- 

79.10 80.83 B: she has no children 

81.04 89.47 B: and a while ago because i've help- i've been helping her for like three years she told me that she put me in my w- a- put me in her will 

89.58 94.76 B: and i'm like are you crazy [laughter] i said i'm just doing this you know because this is my job 

94.71 106.31 B: you know so now i mean i don't think it's for any kind of you know large thing or anything like that but i don't think i would do that if i couldn't speak to my best friend 

106.44 109.64 A: yeah it'd be quite a big sacrifice i mean ah 

109.73 114.46 A: it it's a question of kind of your personal ethics as well i think 

113.94 123.69 B: well her- here's my prob- when i was young i moved around a lot with m- my my dad even though we stayed pretty much in a 

120.70 121.51 A: yeah 

123.72 126.91 B: two state area pennsylvania and new jersey 

126.92 134.33 B: we moved like six or seven times so every an- and it might have been after like three years or something like that 

134.36 143.91 B: um so every time i had friends i lost a friends so now okay i'm forty nine years old i might have 

143.93 158.75 B: um say five friends that i've had for more than ten years or twenty years okay and those friends i don't think you know if it was a million dollars i don't think i mean i- i- if they told me i couldn't speak to them 

146.85 147.70 A: right 

158.82 161.97 B: for that i don't know if i would do that 

161.26 163.96 A: yeah well i suppose it'd depends on 

163.98 169.82 A: on the friend that they're choosing as well because i know the situation you're talking about sometimes 

169.89 181.20 A: ah losing your friend isn't all that big of a sacrifice but in some cases ah depending on what you've been through with the person maybe ah would be a much more much bigger sacrifice 

180.95 189.49 B: yeah well th- think and the other thing like to give you an idea when i back in the seventies my best friend i was in the record industry for about a year and a half 

189.52 195.45 B: and i used to borrow albums and h- he would borrow albums and we would tape them back then 

195.67 198.84 B: ah instead of burning them [laughter] on c._d.s 

197.72 199.16 A: yeah right 

198.93 205.63 B: so [mn] this guy i knew from like seventy to like seventy nine 

205.91 219.69 B: he and his wife broke up and and i mean when i say i knew him he was my best friend i followed i i mean we must have seen each other four or five times a week even though we lived maybe an hour apart or forty five minutes apart 

219.92 232.84 B: well when he and his wife split up they like sold the house or got rid of the hou- vacated the house in the middle of the night i have not heard or seen him have no a- to me it's almost like he disappeared off the face of the earth 

231.89 232.83 A: yeah 

233.05 237.88 B: and sometimes i sit and wonder you know what the hell happened [laughter] you know where 

236.99 241.82 A: i i definitely have friends who i i don't have any contact with anymore 

241.70 253.70 A: ah you know after a long period of time as well ah so it it is true you know what i mean some people you think you know really well can suddenly disappear out of your life the the other thing that consider to me though is ah 

250.84 251.66 B: yeah 

253.61 267.44 A: you know i wonder if it would make a difference how badly you needed the money if you're already doing pretty well in your business and your family's stable and things like that maybe it wouldn't be such a temptation but if ah if you really needed the money 

267.25 276.54 B: well it's c- it's interesting you brought that up because i had gone through a divorce in ninety five and over the next five years due to the settlement 

267.48 268.40 A: (( ah )) 

276.57 286.92 B: ah i [mn] got into deep financial straights okay i did remarry but i mean i've basically gone through the money that i had 

280.74 281.46 A: oh 

286.94 290.60 B: and ah you know in the settlement and i've you know 

290.64 303.60 B: i'm s- it's a slow process coming back okay now i'm s- to the point where in the next few months i'll be getting rid of some of ah my monthly bills like the car and stuff like that 

293.52 294.30 A: yeah 

303.52 307.81 B: so hopefully i'll be able to start you know going ahead 

307.89 311.53 B: but even though i'm in that financial straight 

311.63 318.82 B: i don't think you know like i said if it's a dear friend i don't think ah 'cause you miss out on too much 

318.09 318.90 A: yeah 

319.11 333.32 A: i don't know i mean maybe going through things like that too can kind of teach you that ah money is just something that can be lost and ah gotten back so maybe it ah gives you the opposite lesson that the money is really not that important anyway 

333.24 338.73 B: y- you could be right there yeah i d- i ah actually i agree with that you know 

338.80 342.76 B: um the perfect example one of my best friends now 

342.86 346.47 B: ah i worked with the person for about six seven years 

346.81 354.65 B: we were very close very good friends we lost touch for about four years and then i read in the newspaper how her ah husband died 

354.93 355.95 A: yeah 

355.35 362.80 B: and he was like in his fifties and i went to the funeral and now for the last two years we've been very close again 

363.09 364.67 B: (( and ah a- )) 

364.96 374.91 B: you know a week doesn't go by where we don't you know see each other and stuff like that so um a lot of times when you lose the touch 

369.30 370.53 A: yeah 

375.24 379.16 B: and then get that back that shows you the friendship 

379.80 388.64 A: yeah that's true i mean that's that's really important one other thing i was thinking of was ah you know it's easy to sit here and talk about what you would do 

388.69 393.71 A: ah but on the other hand if somebody someone really offered you that kind of money 

393.79 397.64 A: it might be really tempting i mean you probably know people 

397.70 400.10 A: who have had a situation where 

400.27 407.93 A: they'd either come into some money or have had the potential to get a better job and they can really become consumed with 

402.96 403.62 B: (( m- )) 

405.08 405.86 B: yeah 

408.04 411.83 A: ah kind of the pursuit of that i mean i've know people who 

411.86 425.87 A: you know seem like they cared more about their family and things like that but eventually developed kind of a an attitude where they yeah i mean i guess it's greed you know but they just really were so driven to get more money and more money and that seemed 

417.86 419.08 B: agreed 

420.01 420.74 B: yeah 

426.09 430.18 A: something really more important in their life after a while 

429.59 432.39 B: yes see now i couldn't live m- with myself 

432.70 435.65 B: for that a- that just ah 

436.20 441.35 B: you know i mean like i said these last two years have been tough and then i read about 

439.30 440.11 A: yeah 

441.62 449.50 B: like i'm in insurance and investment i read about a guy an insurance broker who was very successful who burned down his home 

449.42 460.91 B: for actually he had a three hundred fifty thousand dollar home burn it down put in claims then it it took 'em about a year but they found out it was false claims and that he burned it down and i'm like 

460.70 465.34 B: this guy was successful as it was why would he do that you know 

464.40 465.27 A: yeah 

465.46 471.11 B: so ah no but i you know it's like just needing more and more and more 

471.33 475.53 B: you know so a- i think you're right there i think i- 

475.78 486.84 B: it can be tempting you know but like i said you know i would say i only have five friends that i consider you know in that category 

486.55 487.86 A: right 

487.25 491.25 B: and i don't think i would do that you know 

491.93 492.97 B: for 

492.12 497.12 A: yeah i i mean i definitely don't think i would but ah again you know it's hard to it's 

497.13 500.26 A: hard to say when you get ah that kind of money offered to you 

500.03 500.99 B: mhm 

500.38 509.65 A: i mean i i don't it- it's hard for me to ah you know really understand what it would feel like because i don't have the the prospect in my life if anyone just ah 

509.32 515.07 B: well the other thing too is i love sports and athletes today 

509.69 511.48 A: handed me that kind of money 

515.28 521.15 B: you know ah you know when they get this money like when they come up especially like 

520.11 522.16 A: they sure get a lot of it nowadays 

521.51 530.22 B: well especially like in baseball they they only when i say only they might only make like two hundred fifty thousand in the start that i mean compared to the others 

529.96 530.85 A: yeah 

530.23 534.81 B: and they're nice and then once they get the money they start changing 

534.69 535.76 A: yeah 

535.19 542.09 B: okay they're not as nice to the fans they cop an attitude now not all of them okay there are 

540.81 542.74 A: right but a lot of them are 

542.38 550.18 B: okay i mean nolan ryan is a perfect example of a guy who for twenty five years never changed towards the fans no matter what 

548.99 549.92 A: right 

550.24 563.67 B: okay but a lot of 'em you know like my kids will want to get autographs and you know i'll tell them get 'em while the players are at the first couple of years because after that they change and that's what the money does 

563.94 573.40 B: you know a l- and i'm not saying i don't want money i'm not saying that at all but you got to have a conscience you know when you're doing it you can't change 

573.42 575.79 B: just because you have the money 

575.09 580.22 A: yeah a lot of people say a- a- a- hockey players i'm not sure exactly why they 

580.29 590.59 A: seem to be less ah out to change when they get the money like that but especially it seems like in basketball you see a lot of guys who are who are just horrible after they get money 

586.91 589.87 B: oh definit- well the reason hockey 

590.02 599.95 B: they have a whole different mentality in the respect that you know you get a basketball player or a baseball player who has a bruised knee and he's out a hoc- 

598.20 599.21 A: yeah
