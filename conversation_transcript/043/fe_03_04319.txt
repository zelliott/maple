17.46 22.02 B: and okay if i could go back in time and change something 

22.27 24.53 B: i think it would be my children 

24.97 28.59 B: i have a daughter and i had her when i was twenty two 

29.03 40.85 B: and i have another one that i just had i have two i have a seven year old and a three year old and the reason why i would probably change that is because i think i had them too early 

41.19 47.94 B: i w- yeah i would really try and you know have them a little bit later so i can do a lot more things that i wanted to do and i'm ready to 

41.25 42.41 A: yeah

61.44 65.04 A: my boyfriend here says that i should go back in time and 

65.06 68.93 A: help change the legal drinking age to fourteen but i don't think that's a good idea [noise] 

68.49 70.98 B: oh listen [laughter] 

71.01 77.64 B: i mean well i see i because i have kids and like man i want to go on vacation and things like that 

77.78 79.81 B: i can't do anything 

79.69 80.92 A: yeah 

80.31 86.04 B: unless i get like a babysitter and i don't really trust anyone to watch my children except my mom 

86.88 89.08 A: yeah and you can't have her do it all the time 

88.49 90.93 B: yeah and she works so 

90.99 95.02 B: that would just be my main thing but i would keep the same two kids 

95.18 97.56 A: yeah just make them a little later on [noise] 

96.91 99.26 B: yeah just make it a little later 

99.29 101.64 B: on in time because ah 

102.14 107.33 B: i had so many events that i wanted to go do like spring break i mean even though i'm twenty nine 

107.47 110.01 B: i don't look it and i don't feel it so 

109.96 117.51 A: yeah see my my neighbor well she's like my best friend since kindergarten and she's like that now she's twenty three and she's got a 

117.53 118.94 A: two and a half year old 

119.34 132.02 A: and ri- just now she's decided she wants to go to bars and you know go out and party and and do all this stuff and you know she wouldn't do that when she was seventeen eighteen nineteen she's wanting to do it now though and she can't do it 

130.37 131.37 B: yeah 

131.76 134.18 B: yeah yeah i mean 

134.87 143.46 B: i'm i just want to go on vacation to have fun go on spring break and i want to go buy a bike i'm trying right now i'm trying to get a bike 

139.06 140.04 A: yeah 

143.48 150.27 B: but ah i can't do anything because i have these kids and i was i would actually change me going to school more 

147.10 147.97 A: (( yeah )) 

150.82 156.70 B: i mean i went to school quite a few times i went to like computer school and i did this and that other but 

156.77 162.00 B: like right out of high school i would have really got a really good trade and stuck with it 

162.33 163.31 A: (( yeah )) 

162.43 163.56 B: you know 

163.78 165.96 B: it's probably because i have children 

166.19 171.69 B: and now it's like i'm trying to go to school also i have two kids i try i'm trying to go to school trying to work 

172.05 180.10 B: and i'm a single parent so that is most definitely something that i would definitely change is not having kids right away even though twenty two is not that young 

180.69 182.19 B: it's still not so old 

180.97 184.55 A: it's still pretty young though it's just it makes it harder 

182.58 190.82 B: yeah yeah yeah it's a lot harder a lot and like i said now i wish i didn't have you know the kids i would love to 

191.30 192.77 B: push it back 

193.75 198.75 B: but um other than that i guess the kids and just school and 

198.47 200.76 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

199.43 200.91 B: tells you something 

201.31 202.93 A: i kind of wish i had 

203.44 208.45 A: started out in what i'm doing now earlier in school because i added a year to college you know 

208.64 210.55 A: (( because i didn't know what i was going to do )) 

210.73 211.79 B: okay 

212.03 217.17 A: and i i wish i could go back and change go and start m- i f- i ended up a biology major i 

217.37 220.54 A: wish i could go back and change it to that in the beginning 

217.48 218.26 B: okay 

220.76 222.45 A: cut off the extra year 

222.77 223.91 B: okay 

224.79 227.84 B: well i'm going to school to be a police or a state trooper 

227.87 230.31 B: i'm trying become a state trooper yes 

228.11 229.20 A: really 

231.27 234.77 B: and it's i have i have two years to go 

234.91 237.37 A: ooh is that a pretty good job once you make it there though 

237.35 242.94 B: well they start you off at thirty thousand for training then you go up to fifty thousand once you become 

242.02 244.22 A: that's pretty that's pretty good 

243.40 252.24 B: one yeah but it's ah it's really hard because i have two kids and my school hours are from like ah six till eleven 

252.25 253.60 A: (( oh )) 

252.52 258.52 B: and tonight i took off a little early i came home a little bit early because i've been doing it for like almost 

258.54 261.76 B: not even a year yet and i'm getting a little tired of it 

261.80 263.22 B: because ah 

263.78 271.33 B: the two kids and just school and and i go to work in the morning so it will definitely definitely be taking the kids 

271.55 276.12 B: taking them back i think i would have kids about i guess thirty 

276.21 277.05 B: [laughter] 

277.05 278.93 A: (( yeah that makes it a little bit easier )) 

278.66 281.41 B: yeah and that at least thirty 

281.50 283.61 B: (( that will make it a little bit easier )) 

283.74 286.58 B: but i'd definitely keep the same two 

288.56 293.64 A: yeah i think i think a lot of people are like that though they wish they'd just waited a little longer [mn] 

293.73 295.33 B: but i didn't plan them 

295.58 296.56 B: (( they were just )) 

295.90 299.16 A: yeah hardly anybody does 

298.59 300.40 B: you know [laughter] 

300.77 305.79 B: but see that's why i mean like man i want to get my tubes tied so i don't have any more 

306.01 311.04 B: so i can just it would be a lot easier as far as going to school and doing things 

313.15 317.71 B: but and i don't think i would change too much i think my life is pretty happy 

318.02 320.29 B: i'm pretty happy the way i am now 

320.32 322.71 A: yeah i'm pretty happy the way i am now too 

324.08 324.99 B: so 

325.41 326.60 B: [laughter] 

326.64 328.45 B: ah let's see ah 

328.86 331.91 B: get back on the to- [laughter] this is so 

331.06 332.39 A: time travel 

332.24 335.50 B: yeah it's like really funny

338.52 341.87 B: let me see let me see my kids whoa 

342.55 344.35 B: i had a pretty good 

344.61 348.21 B: teenage years so there's not really much i would change as 

348.33 351.61 B: far as being a teenager back in those days 

351.97 352.75 B: (( but it w- )) 

352.22 359.03 A: well if you could just go anywhere back in time just for a visit well any time where would you go 

359.97 363.45 B: i think i would go back to when i was like seventeen or eighteen 

363.68 366.01 A: yeah i probably would too 

364.44 365.30 B: and w- my 

365.73 369.08 B: yeah they were my best years [laughter] 

366.72 367.41 A: or 

369.24 377.19 B: i had no kids i was in out of school i was in computer school i was doing pretty good how o- how old are you now 

377.26 378.57 A: i'm twenty three 

378.16 380.02 B: okay yeah okay 

380.50 386.15 B: well i'm an old hand but i don't feel it see that's the problem that's why i want to 

386.86 393.23 B: you know get the kids out of the way because i have two and oh my god girlfriend you just don't know 

393.50 401.35 B: it's not even the money really a lot of people complain about the money but it's just the time the time i cannot i don't i can't do anything 

401.44 402.47 A: yeah 

401.65 403.60 B: i can't do anything 

403.72 410.29 B: and it's just like a major bummer if i could just do anything just to take them back 

411.46 412.58 B: but um 

412.88 417.59 B: i don't know a lot of people i know does it and kids you know get through it so 

418.71 423.18 B: but i was always taught not to regret anything to learn from it 

419.00 419.99 A: (( yes )) 

424.25 425.39 B: (( so )) 

425.01 426.91 A: probably the best way to go anyway 

426.93 428.20 B: yeah 

429.08 435.32 B: that would be my major two things if i had a choice of at least two now if i had a choice of three 

436.27 437.71 B: [sigh] 

437.79 440.36 B: i don't know my kids schooling 

440.84 442.16 B: and ah 

443.09 448.85 B: i think my driver's license i don't have a driver's license is that bad 

449.69 454.54 B: and i think i would change that also they would be my major three things that i would change 

453.90 455.84 A: you don't have a driver's license 

455.36 455.98 B: (( nh-nh )) 

456.35 458.57 B: i never had one i know 

456.56 457.35 A: ooh 

458.15 461.68 A: you've got to have one to be a state like a like a state trooper or whatever 

460.97 466.85 B: oh yeah well see now that i'm getting it now i'm working on it now it's that when i was younger 

467.38 477.19 B: i never i mean i went and got a permit and everything and i drove around and i never really got stopped so like now i have got stopped and don't have a license i just bought a brand new car 

477.26 485.13 B: so man i'm trying to get it straightened while i'm in school so they would be my major three things if i could change three things going back 

484.47 486.87 A: so what where do you live i 

487.53 491.54 B: you would not believe where i live i live right across the street from a police station 

491.80 493.04 B: (( in upper )) 

492.95 495.79 A: mean like what state though that's what i was trying to figure out like

496.68 497.65 A: okay 

497.78 504.05 B: i live in philadelphia but i live across the street from a police station so every time i pull my car out of my garage 

497.88 498.66 A: (( right )) 

504.26 506.60 B: you know i'm feel in some type of way 

506.61 507.47 B: (( oh )) 

507.56 508.98 A: yeah 

508.65 512.88 B: like i said if i had three major things i would change that would be my driver's license 

512.99 523.80 B: having the kids at a later age and when i came fresh out of high school to stuck with you know started my career on being a police officer then instead of now 

526.70 530.25 B: it's like if you had three what would you be what would you change you 

530.71 531.64 A: (( [sigh] oh )) 

532.25 533.37 A: (( i don't know )) 

534.19 535.25 B: don't know 

534.34 536.82 A: (( i would start on my biology thing earlier )) 

537.76 540.53 A: i would save my money 

541.96 544.28 A: instead of spending it on junk 

545.43 551.97 A: um because i mean when i was you know a teenager and i was waiting tables i made so much money and i just blew it all 

552.19 553.93 A: (( and i didn't have any bills then ))
