0.09 2.78 A: hello this is renato from san francisco 

0.27 1.18 B: (( fr- )) 

2.78 4.46 B: hi this is francisco 

4.87 8.17 A: hi um what i'm okay how are you 

5.61 6.64 B: (( how are you )) 

7.91 9.14 B: okay thanks 

9.26 10.23 A: yeah 

9.29 12.43 B: well i thought i would i would thought i would have an answer for what they would ask but then 

12.48 19.96 B: ooh why should talk [laughter] about that topic it's interesting 'cause so many things what we want to do i guess and [sigh] have done before i guess 

18.69 26.97 A: right right well what exactly what exactly um would you have changed i mean if you had any po- possibility would you change anything 

20.09 21.01 B: right 

27.79 29.23 B: um 

28.82 29.97 A: (( [noise] in a moment )) 

30.28 32.96 B: right um i'm trying to think quickly [sigh] 

33.02 40.42 B: [lipsmack] well i think like everyone says you know when when people people say i would have done this or that i think mostly have to do with 

40.43 42.78 B: with maybe decisions maybe um 

42.97 47.61 B: things you have done and i'm trying to be specific let's see um i i guess i don't 

46.18 48.04 A: yeah so it's very difficult 

47.94 50.61 B: r- right i think it would be it would have been 

51.57 52.64 B: (( ah )) 

52.69 59.45 B: probably i i think in my case i think i ah i i make good decisions but i think that at the same time i'm too cautious 

59.67 64.68 B: i probably i don't know if it's being scared or i'm just i just want to prepare things and want to plan everything 

60.09 61.91 A: mhm 

64.69 65.62 A: uh-huh 

65.01 71.48 B: and at times you know that's not always necessary and sometimes even though you may be able able to avoid certain problems 

71.74 74.74 B: by being that way sometimes it's a matter of um 

74.87 78.25 B: i guess living a little more [laughter] and just doing it i guess i got 

78.50 81.48 B: to ah just doing it and and different areas you know from maybe 

78.71 79.51 A: uh-huh 

82.15 92.10 A: yeah it's a it's a very it's an interesting topic 'cause ah all ah well when they proposed the question i didn't really know what to think i thought of time travel and like ah those um new developments on the universe 

90.15 91.06 B: (( yeah right )) 

92.04 106.01 A: being shaped as a doughnut and time travel being quite possible but then again if i could change something in time like um i once read a story about someone who went back in time and in the prehistoric area and they were roaming around with dinosaurs and 

93.22 94.23 B: (( [laughter] uh-huh hm mhm mhm )) 

95.30 96.09 B: (( mhm mm mhm )) 

105.99 115.51 A: couldn't leave the past and the person went on the journey and when he came back to the shuttle to the space ship taking him back to the present time he noticed that he had stepped on a butterfly 

115.73 126.42 A: and um when he had left this democratic president was being elected when he came back it was a whole dictatorship but it made me realise how little things really like 

126.35 131.69 A: change a lot you know like the butterfly was the symbol of beauty and there was an ironic story you know 

132.16 146.75 A: but um relating to like historical facts i mean should things be changed i mean are things necessarily should be changed i would would things be different you know like i think maybe everything happens for a reason you know like everything 

146.83 150.25 A: well were here right now because of everything that's happened 

150.17 151.03 B: right 

150.40 157.18 A: but is it is the world perfect the world isn't perfect what could it w- what changes could have been made in the past to make the world a better place today 

158.05 159.22 B: (( mhm right )) 

159.29 160.93 A: [noise] i 

160.68 161.87 B: [laughter] 

162.30 164.61 B: r- right that's a good point yeah that's a good point 

162.34 163.55 A: (( i don't know )) 

163.99 165.55 A: [laughter] 

164.65 165.95 B: [laughter] 

165.64 168.14 A: (( is this your first ah fisher )) 

168.18 170.53 B: ah it's my second time 

170.03 172.54 A: (( okay so you've had )) 

170.63 176.08 B: first one was about five days ago [sigh] and yeah it's interesting um- 

175.25 176.54 A: (( where are [noise] )) 

176.59 180.96 B: i we'll see what happens like it sounds like they would have it's a whole system they have to 

181.53 185.43 B: to interview and everything and to organize it so it sounds sounds well made so we'll see but we 

185.14 189.74 A: (( yeah yeah well we'll definitely find out what's going on you know eventually )) 

189.59 190.80 B: (( can right )) 

191.13 192.75 B: (( and um mhm mhm )) 

193.05 205.26 A: well what things come to mind the when you when you think of change like to me it kind of like you know ah germany and the nazis you know like you know that that's something that was a you know i've always been shocked by the horrors that like 

205.03 215.04 A: hitler imposed on the world but you know 'cause his death had prevented like you know terror happening in such a way that it did you know 

215.28 219.09 A: like in in maybe another source another form you know like 

220.43 223.37 B: mhm let me ask you what i guess the question had to do more with 

223.52 231.89 B: with ourselves i think it what would it w- what would i change if i had a chance to wh- did they ask change in history or change about yourself i i wasn't i thought they asked 

232.35 234.28 B: what about yourself that 

232.55 237.13 A: well they they said to talk about time travel and i guess yourself what would you change 

234.44 235.19 B: yeah 

236.23 237.57 B: right right 

237.59 246.07 B: but yeah but then i and then again going just going to the question again do you think was it 'cause maybe i am getting confused [lipsmack] they 

246.14 253.41 B: was it that open to ask about general or or did he ask what about you what would you change about yourself if you had a chance to go back 

253.01 263.43 A: i i i think i heard what would you change in in in history and what would you change if had a if you went back in time like what would you know like no matter how far 

255.80 256.61 B: (( ah )) 

257.25 258.08 B: (( oh )) 

259.81 261.41 B: okay mm 

261.48 262.73 B: you have a point 'cause 

263.94 269.79 B: right i hear your point i th- thought like like the question was about me let's see if i had a chance to go back then what would i change about me hm 

268.60 271.14 A: (( i okay well yeah )) 

269.82 272.82 B: but maybe you're right maybe you're right like i say i was going ooh what would i change 

271.25 275.95 A: like if it was if it was that i don't think they would they'd mind [laughter] 

274.95 283.28 B: right i thought i was going ooh what would i change and if i talk about about let's see um [lipsmack] this you know decisions or being more decisive or something like 

283.27 292.26 B: that and so i'm but maybe you're right maybe you or maybe that's like wh- why would you talk about yourself and i'm trying to think about something in general maybe about history and see if it if it works kind of 

292.40 293.29 A: uh-huh 

292.50 294.37 B: a that way and let's see 

294.95 296.42 B: (( [lipsmack] ah hm mhm mhm )) 

297.59 304.76 A: well like ah something that comes to mind to me like if i may just fill the void is ah september eleventh you know 

305.29 306.36 A: (( like )) 

306.79 308.53 A: (( i don't know if like )) 

308.91 322.60 A: if that could be somewhat avoided by going back to like the roots of that problem being not not like a spontaneous hijacking but like just like america's antagonism with the world you know 

323.53 324.68 A: (( you know [noise] )) 

324.12 326.36 B: (( mhm right right [lipsmack] )) 

327.41 338.14 B: yeah it's it's kind of interesting i think they when they ah answer the question the way they remind me of what happens in the movie back to the future 'cause [laughter] it seems like that but i guess i mean it's probably 

338.48 345.17 B: something that would never happen we'll never know but it it what happens in the movie at times is when when the guy in the movie goes back and then and then 

345.03 355.90 B: ch- changes a little something i guess and and and then the doctor's no don't do that because then everything will change everything that you're doing now will do will affect the outcome later on so that was kind of interesting you know like 

353.88 355.19 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

355.69 362.25 B: um like if we were only it's kinda anyways just and i wo- actually personally personally i i've alway liked 

362.49 371.18 B: ah topically that are i guess th- you know in in regards to movies i've always liked the movie where the guy had to go back in time or going in the future because it's just something that i have a 

368.99 375.11 A: (( [noise] yeah it's such a magical ah theme you know anything's possible and )) 

371.70 372.48 B: right 

372.53 373.81 B: right right 

374.36 375.34 B: right 

375.74 386.98 B: yeah so then i [lipsmack] some there's a book ah i had a time life book a long time ago when i was growing up and it it talked about einstein's theory of relativity and i thought it was interesting because 

385.22 386.35 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

387.01 394.42 B: what i remember reading in the book was that somehow they the way they put it and and i guess it's so- something that's been tested in a way 

394.43 397.03 B: if anything i guess not so much going to the 

397.04 398.95 B: past would be a a um 

399.23 405.18 B: um a thing that could be made but it seems like going to into the future could happen within a way 

405.29 413.84 B: for example it was show they were saying that if if there were um a vehicle that could go probably close or as fast as what they called ah the speed of light 

414.01 428.74 B: they said that the person could go on a is it is it somebody could go on on that particular m- um space ship or whatever if they were away for about i don't know i have to have a think they went away for about a week or something when they were to come back 

414.10 415.25 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

418.55 419.25 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

428.59 429.55 A: [noise] 

429.17 434.69 B: ah things on earth would have aged about fifteen years so that's and that's also mi- mind boggling i thought wow imagine 

431.88 433.24 A: [noise] [noise] right 

433.87 434.68 A: [noise] 

434.88 436.30 B: so it's kind of weird ah 

436.37 442.09 A: yeah this is interesting because um [noise] um i i i read a book called ice and physics 

441.81 442.73 B: okay 

442.20 450.16 A: and it describes a cube wh- in space and that and pr- and speculates this cube going at ah um the speed of light in space 

450.56 458.09 A: and ah when you look at a cube you can only see maybe three sides of the cube of the six sided cube right but in space going at speed of light 

455.07 456.12 B: (( mm mm )) 

458.10 465.62 A: what happens to the cube is that you can see six sides simultaneously 'cause you can see the whole cube from the same perspective all at once 

465.03 466.08 B: (( mm )) 

465.64 471.41 A: they say a human being going at the speed of light would be able to see the past the present and the future all at once 

471.03 472.07 B: (( mm mm )) 

471.72 476.48 A: which i think is a mind boggling idea i don't i can't even conceive that you know like 

473.72 474.85 B: [laughter] 

475.47 476.37 B: uh-huh 

476.44 477.39 B: (( uh-huh )) 

476.93 486.10 A: you know [noise] but i mean do you think time travel is a is a feasible thing do you think i mean ah our futures are somehow like [noise] i don't know could or something 

486.66 498.79 B: i only ah maybe because a lot i've been thinking of when we see it i maybe like they say maybe that you could go into the future but i don't think i think the past is something that already happened and something that's not it's more of a our idea of of something 'cause it 

487.35 488.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

498.71 507.13 B: you know my let's say my me right i'm moving my hands and doing it i'm most i'm spe- ah speaking to you i don't think that can happen again [laughter] just because in the future i mean i mean ah 

507.22 514.79 B: i don't know it's kind of it's interesting but i don't know i i think i like it's going to go one way 'cause it only goes forward i guess not not to the to the past but maybe could go forward 

512.46 513.38 A: uh-huh 

514.08 517.17 A: but do you but do you think it's possible to go to the past i mean 

516.74 517.87 B: no 

517.78 518.59 A: no 

518.71 519.58 A: okay 

520.01 521.90 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

520.06 521.04 A: okay 

521.62 526.66 A: (( okay [laughter] i don't want to sound crazy by saying i think that )) 

523.10 524.76 B: (( but ah yeah yeah )) 

524.92 528.52 B: you never know you never know oh good so you think maybe yeah 

527.93 539.97 A: i think so well well like according to like recent developments yeah on on the expansion of the universe and we think the universe is is linear and it it's sort of expanding 

528.78 529.45 B: yeah 

534.53 536.12 B: (( mm oh )) 

539.35 541.76 B: yeah it's like a circle kinda kinda thing 

541.18 544.24 A: right like almost have you have you heard of stephen hawking 

543.80 545.11 B: yeah yeah yeah 

544.79 552.76 A: right the wheelchair guy well he proposed the idea that um ah the ah the universe is actually kind of like a funnel 

546.03 547.05 B: right 

551.99 553.44 B: (( mhm mm mhm mm mhm )) 

552.88 559.28 A: that you cross and like and and he went off on black holes being like time warp and what not 

559.27 565.50 A: but they've just they've they um the new york times came out with this ah article maybe ah two months ago 

565.50 578.73 A: on that um the common thoughts of the universe being linear has changed due to like recent like scientific developments but it's now like a doughnut we think it lo- it's more connected like tube-like 

578.16 579.42 B: (( right right mhm )) 

579.05 589.58 A: and that that's definitely a speculation that if the universe is somewhat connected and there is no no beginning no end that it's an infinite circle 

589.55 595.16 A: then ah if we moved fast enough and far enough we'll eventually come back to the same place 

594.61 595.81 B: (( mhm mm )) 

596.15 597.76 B: (( yeah interesting )) 

597.81 598.77 B: yeah 

598.14 599.89 A: (( i i don't know i just ))
