13.12 13.96 A: mhm 

14.31 24.53 B: i think it would depend on whether or not i could explain beforehand to my best friend why i was doing what i was doing

24.12 25.56 A: yeah 

25.00 26.30 B: and

35.49 36.77 A: mhm

68.99 69.83 A: yeah 

74.64 75.70 A: mhm 

75.01 83.60 B: relative y- you know it didn't say break contact completely it said i believe it said you know not speak to her 

76.90 77.75 A: mhm

91.64 92.52 A: mhm 

94.11 95.12 B: oh 

95.75 99.86 B: a good forty five minutes half an hour depending on what traffic you 

99.94 100.69 A: (( oh )) 

100.01 101.96 B: you hit where are you located 

102.00 103.62 A: wilmington delaware

111.19 112.02 A: (( oh )) 

112.67 118.67 B: what do you think you would do if you were offered a [laughter] a million dollars not to s- 

115.99 116.98 A: a million 

117.73 120.07 A: no i wouldn't i wouldn't even consider it 

120.07 121.06 B: you know 

120.57 125.98 A: [sigh] they would have said speak talk not do that not do that i couldn't do it 

125.84 127.91 B: i think they said speak 

127.51 132.55 A: yeah i know but i'm saying if they included every form of communication 

131.33 145.79 B: oh if they yeah if they included every form of contact no i- it would not even be it wouldn't be acceptable but i'm thinking because my best friend had so many um 

136.54 138.57 A: no i wouldn't do it at all 

139.71 140.47 A: no 

146.15 157.59 B: problems with her she had a a an incredibly ill child who required tremendous tremendous financial you know b- um 

156.18 157.14 A: mhm 

158.19 166.15 B: if i could aid her and make life easier for her but still maintain contact not necessarily speaking 

162.29 163.33 A: mhm 

165.89 166.97 A: yeah 

166.21 169.37 B: but maintain contact with her 

169.09 170.50 A: mhm 

170.40 173.33 B: that would be acceptable but um 

173.84 178.94 B: a- a- to just eliminate her immediately from my life no 

177.48 178.62 A: mhm 

178.96 180.99 B: no couldn't do it 

178.97 180.24 A: mhm 

180.71 183.37 A: no i understand no i would i wouldn't ah 

183.53 184.74 A: (( um )) 

185.16 187.50 A: i wouldn't i i wouldn't even consider it 

187.40 188.61 B: yeah 

188.00 192.32 A: i mean they it could be it could be ten million and i still wouldn't do it 

191.46 195.22 B: even if she required some financial assistance 

195.33 199.46 A: ah well it just so happens i can even think about that because she doesn't 

199.50 205.89 B: yeah well no i'm thinking of a very broad picture if everything was you know 

202.41 203.32 A: (( oh mhm )) 

205.94 218.71 B: hunky dory and we were going along and you know maintaining the status quo no because there are too many benefits to be derived from a long lasting there's an expression you know some day you're going to need your friends 

218.45 219.35 A: yeah 

218.74 221.20 B: you better make sure you have them in place 

220.89 221.88 A: yeah 

221.27 225.50 B: you know for when you're going to need them because there are times when 

226.29 232.37 B: things you can't discuss with your family or ah you know you need a perspective 

232.00 233.41 A: mhm 

233.21 236.99 B: you know s- from someone who knows you and accepts you 

237.68 239.74 B: despite your flaws 

239.00 240.73 A: no i understand that 

240.14 241.27 B: you know 

240.87 242.03 A: mhm 

241.43 244.62 B: and ah so i agree there are some 

245.08 250.09 B: p- there's probably a point at which it's not even considered there's not enough money 

248.84 249.70 A: yeah 

249.74 253.58 A: no now but they would say ah ah if um 

253.85 258.30 A: you were to have ah you you couldn't talk to them for a year 

258.62 259.61 B: yeah 

259.09 264.93 A: i mean you could you could probably deal with that but ah not not for a forever and and i 

261.21 262.27 B: yeah 

263.45 266.37 B: no g- to give up completely no 

265.77 271.91 A: yeah and i think that ah they meant all communication it didn't seem like speak i think that was just like a technical thing 

271.52 283.82 B: yeah that could you could be very right in that case no it would not be unless as i say unless there were incredibly extenua- extenuating circumstances 

283.42 284.23 A: yeah 

283.89 287.64 B: from which she could be benefitted by 

286.75 288.56 A: yeah no i understand 

287.91 291.85 B: you know but other than that no no
