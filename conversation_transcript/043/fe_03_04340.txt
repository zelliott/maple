87.00 89.85 B: so what you do if you was to go back in time 

89.81 98.69 A: um i think i don't think i would go back in time just because i would be afraid that changing one thing would screw up everything else 

98.63 99.94 B: yeah that's true 

99.77 111.29 A: yeah but i don't i mean i don't really have any huge complaints about my past i guess you could say but i would definitely i would definitely take the chance of going to the future um just if like i don't know 

111.38 115.15 A: [noise] it'd just be kind of weird to like have to like i don't know 

115.17 125.72 A: it just i i don't know if i would want to know where my life was headed kind of you know but i think i would go into the like if i wanted to know what was what i was going to do tomorrow i would check it out 

119.46 120.37 B: (( mhm no )) 

125.20 126.77 B: yeah that's true

128.96 131.34 B: (( ah i mean i mean )) 

131.69 138.09 B: [lipsmack] ah i don't know i'm like i said never thought of it guess if i was to go in the future i would want to see 

134.89 135.87 A: mhm 

138.62 139.89 B: what my 

139.91 147.12 B: children have become [laughter] you know whether they you know what profession they are

142.15 143.03 A: uh-huh 

146.85 148.13 A: right 

147.27 148.80 B: something like that 

148.96 156.63 A: so so if you could go into the future and see something [noise] like that and you didn't like the result like what would you 

157.40 163.12 A: would you would you change when you got back to the present would you change it so that it didn't happen like that 

162.59 164.52 B: it depends on what it is 

163.97 164.85 A: uh-huh 

165.07 167.24 B: i mean if it's ah i- 

169.63 173.66 B: if i- if if there was my daughter being a doctor or a lawyer 

173.59 174.86 A: mhm 

173.83 175.37 B: if she was 

175.77 179.13 B: ah i don't know a waitress or something like that but if she's happy 

178.73 180.17 A: right 

179.44 180.43 B: (( you know )) 

180.94 184.10 B: then i i wouldn't i wouldn't change it 

184.32 187.73 B: (( i mean i don't know if i would even change if there was drastic )) 

187.88 190.60 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

188.41 190.11 B: because i mean 

191.32 196.05 B: it's not really in my hands to do it you know to make the changes 

193.41 195.23 A: right right 

196.41 197.48 B: um 

198.01 203.72 B: but i mean if it wa- if need be i mean you know i wouldn't mind going to the future to see 

203.93 205.74 B: what my children have become 

206.05 210.82 A: [noise] mhm that's that what about for yourself like what would you want to know about yourself 

210.57 211.65 B: um 

213.25 216.59 B: i would want to know where my how where my career's headed 

219.00 221.76 B: um retirement [laughter] you know um i 

225.92 227.92 B: guess to be older 

227.52 230.42 A: mhm mhm 

227.96 230.27 B: grandkids you know 

230.49 233.26 B: to see exactly how my life is 

233.39 236.59 B: going off into the sunset me and my husband 

235.27 237.65 A: (( [noise] right )) 

237.00 238.95 B: see exactly where we are 

237.83 240.90 A: (( right )) 

239.08 240.06 B: (( um )) 

240.62 243.01 B: as far as mindset and everything 

242.53 243.79 A: [noise] 

243.88 246.74 B: no sickness or anything like that so 

245.25 247.18 A: (( mhm )) 

247.45 256.66 B: i mean that would basically be it i mean just to see how we're living i don't know if i really want to go back and change anything but you know if we could change 

257.19 265.48 B: you know we would do it you know people people would want to if they could have opportunity of changing it course they're going to change it but um 

260.09 261.99 A: mhm 

262.97 266.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

266.37 269.39 B: (( i mean that would basically be it for me mhm )) 

268.09 269.55 A: mhm 

270.66 273.69 A: yeah i think i think that's what i would do too like i mean 

273.96 284.02 A: i wouldn't [sigh] i wouldn't want to change anything that wasn't otherwise like disastrous you know what i mean i would change the bad things but other than that i would just kind of let it take it's course i guess 

279.49 280.42 B: yeah 

283.72 284.77 B: yeah 

284.67 285.70 A: so 

287.56 293.97 A: but if so if you had to pick if you had to pick maybe traveling to the future or traveling to the past [noise] which would you do 

295.17 296.52 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

297.69 299.74 B: i'm not sure um 

301.85 303.55 B: i would say the future 

303.15 304.24 A: mhm 

303.62 315.98 B: only because the past like you said if you do too much traveling in the past if you start blundering around the next thing you know your future or your present won't be the way y- you left it 

315.80 317.58 A: right right 

316.01 329.43 B: 'cause you've been doing stuff in the past so i would generally say the definitely the future i would see what the future will have for my for myself my husband for our children to see 

321.53 322.94 A: mhm 

324.04 324.89 A: mhm 

329.68 331.24 B: what they've become 

331.59 333.94 B: where we are um 

332.63 334.04 A: mhm 

334.70 338.20 B: (( [lipsmack] and that would be you know basically it um )) 

338.60 340.54 B: and then i guess i would just 

340.69 343.99 B: work on i would i would prefer 

344.66 348.49 B: (( [sigh] not to change anything but what i would do is i would work on )) 

348.57 350.42 B: whatever i need to work on 

351.07 354.38 B: in the present going into the future than changing 

354.87 356.92 B: um the future itself 

356.34 358.10 A: mhm 

357.05 358.70 B: i would do it that way 

358.22 359.94 A: mhm 

359.07 365.56 B: so i mean if it's forward and they have m- more tutoring [laughter] or something like that 

364.98 366.29 A: right right 

365.69 375.27 B: you know i would do it in the positive way where it wouldn't still hinder whatever the future is but it will kinda help it so at least i have an idea of 

367.81 369.14 A: right 

375.10 378.71 A: right right that's definitely a a good way of looking at it i guess 

377.86 379.11 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] well but that's )) 

379.18 380.02 A: so 

382.31 389.11 A: mhm i'm trying to i had when they called me before i had the same topic so i'm trying to think of where the conversation went then 

388.66 390.94 B: about it oh really [laughter] okay oh god 

389.28 401.23 A: yeah what about oh that this is another one um [noise] if you could travel to the future to a point beyond your life like hundreds of years ahead what do you think it would be and would you do it 

401.39 402.50 B: (( i don't know )) 

401.86 403.51 A: mhm 

402.94 406.80 B: i don't know if i would do that [laughter] i'd probably be scared 

404.08 405.14 A: mhm 

405.83 409.41 A: that's it that's what the other thought that's what we both agreed on it was kinda like 

408.22 417.02 B: [laughter] i'm like ah ah i would be scared to see exactly what what life forces would be a hundred years from now 

416.65 417.97 A: right 

417.21 427.31 B: you know i mean will we actually be flying or i mean you know i'm like i i don't know we're close to flying already with some of these vehicles we have now 

425.12 426.10 A: mhm 

427.08 428.34 A: right 

427.37 429.95 B: so i'm not quite sure if i really wanna 

429.98 432.08 B: venture off that far 

431.64 433.03 A: [noise] right right right 

432.17 436.56 B: 'cause it's past my existance and my children's existance 

436.16 437.48 A: mhm 

436.86 441.25 B: so we talking about going into their children's existence i don't know 

440.97 442.10 A: right 

441.50 443.54 B: (( so i don't want to do that )) 

442.91 444.93 A: that would definitely be kinda strange 

444.29 446.50 B: yeah that would be really 

445.86 448.99 A: you know or like what if like the world wasn't around anymore 

448.45 454.69 B: exactly and you go there and there's like space [laughter] like hello 

449.16 450.08 A: you know 

451.65 453.64 A: (( r- right right [laughter] )) 

454.10 455.87 A: yeah exactly 

455.05 458.36 B: (( where is everyone no no thank you )) 

456.28 457.59 A: right 

458.02 459.70 A: yeah exactly or if 

458.83 461.90 B: (( i don't want that on conscience [laughter] for the rest of my life )) 

460.28 466.50 A: or if right if if you knew something bad was coming and you had to go back to your present it's like you know no one would believe you 

465.10 466.39 B: and and you 

466.42 470.57 B: no no i i no i wouldn't be able to deal with it i wouldn't mhm no 

468.88 469.83 A: yeah 

471.17 485.82 B: i wouldn't be able to deal with that if we were going through famine and war or something crazy i wouldn't mhm it would it would just 'cause it affected i wouldn't know i wouldn't you would know the year and the time and stuff but you really wouldn't know when it began 

475.28 476.53 A: right 

485.69 487.76 A: right right 

486.01 490.22 B: you know you could really just be in the smack middle of it you know mhm 

489.88 491.55 A: that's a good point right 

490.71 492.07 B: no no thank you 

491.63 493.65 A: yeah 

493.04 494.35 B: don't like that game 

494.00 496.39 A: no i'd i'd yeah i'd definitely hear you on that one 

495.40 497.23 B: [laughter] 

496.69 499.42 A: without a doubt so [cough] [noise] 

500.29 510.41 A: i don't know if you could go into the past to see someone like to meet someone would like someone famous or just a family member or something like what would you do that or 

510.15 512.14 B: oh yes i would um 

512.57 514.82 B: i would see my grandmother 

514.54 515.40 A: uh-huh 

515.22 516.97 B: (( mhm i would see my grandmother )) 

516.92 518.75 A: mhm 

517.28 520.72 B: 'cause she i was young when she passed so i didn't get a chance to really know her 

520.35 521.25 A: uh-huh 

520.97 525.02 B: and um she would be the one i would i would spend some time with 

524.77 526.93 A: right right 

525.47 527.82 B: to get to know her better um 

528.55 529.74 B: and 

532.59 537.53 B: ah i think that would be it because everyone else is basically around me 

537.64 545.98 B: oh and my great grandmother the one that i suppo- i supposedly look like i would have to meet her [laughter] as well um 

539.41 540.31 A: uh-huh 

543.47 544.45 A: uh-huh 

544.78 547.00 A: right right had 

546.12 547.27 B: but um 

547.86 553.54 B: no one else i mean that i can think of as far as famous no i mean i really 

554.41 563.10 B: i mean it would nobody i mean you know to waste a going back in time i wouldn't waste it on someone famous i would waste it on a family member 

555.15 556.29 A: yeah 

562.74 564.02 A: right right 

563.16 565.12 B: or a loved one i mean 

565.62 569.05 B: that would be more exciting for me than anything else 

568.79 573.50 A: yeah i think i'd want to see like i'd probably go and see my grandfather for the same reason 

573.16 584.39 B: yeah just i mean just to get to know him 'specially if you were young and you really didn't you know understand too much and now that you're older you wish you could get a chance to at least be able to spend some time 

573.73 574.59 A: (( you know )) 

584.15 586.84 A: exactly definitely 

585.00 586.01 B: so 

586.18 589.58 B: (( that would definitely be something that i would want to do )) 

589.00 590.78 A: mhm 

591.17 599.89 A: oh definitely i i completely agree with that like [noise] if it's if if i could change one thing in the past that's what i would do i would i would change my actions regarding things like that
