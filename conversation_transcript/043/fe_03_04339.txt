3.20 4.27 B: mimi 

4.10 5.12 A: hi mimi 

6.45 13.18 B: [sigh] so i guess we're talk- supposed to talk about if what we would change and why if we went back if we had a chance to go back in time 

12.91 14.87 A: if we had a chance to go back in time 

15.28 16.76 A: (( i'm going to say )) 

17.75 20.90 A: there's a couple of very small things that i would do 

20.65 21.58 B: (( uh-huh )) 

21.25 28.84 A: but i wouldn't change anything major because everything's that's happened even my failures all contribute to who i am as a person 

29.95 34.36 B: you know i was thinking the same thing [laughter] it doesn't 

32.95 38.92 A: yeah i mean i've gone through a lot of really bad crap i'm ah i've been through a coma 

38.95 40.61 A: (( i've had kidney failure )) 

38.98 40.22 B: oh really 

40.54 41.45 B: uh-huh 

41.66 45.07 A: and some stuff that you know most people don't really go through 

44.73 45.94 B: right 

45.31 56.28 A: but all of those things have brought me to the spot i'm at today which is actually very nice so i don't think i would i would change some stupid stuff like maybe wear a different dress to prom or something 

56.25 58.66 B: [laughter] 

57.66 62.28 A: [laughter] but [laughter] other than that nothing 

62.11 66.68 B: i know i haven't i haven't really had any major 

66.80 71.07 B: negative things in my life i mean every 

71.81 75.36 B: you know nothing like a coma or a kidney transplant for sure 

75.61 76.81 B: um 

77.07 85.62 B: and so you know i don't even know if i don't even think i would go back and change the little things actually 'cause i i think you're right every little thing kind of 

86.19 88.74 B: builds you up to the person that you are today 

88.81 94.22 A: yeah um i i when they said time travel i was thinking they were talking about um [lipsmack] 

95.23 104.24 A: getting to go back in time like really back in time you know what i mean maybe meeting like abraham lincoln or something i would love to do that 

99.46 101.04 B: yeah 

103.46 107.38 B: yeah or like go forward in time or something 

106.03 120.24 A: yeah yeah something cool but my own life um i'm sure what i would rather do is if i could physically go back and talk to myself then and tell myself whatever i'm going through it'll be all right 

119.58 123.82 B: [laughter] i guess i true yeah 

120.70 122.59 A: that's i- you know 'cause having 

123.11 126.52 A: in my life having faced sometimes 

126.62 132.23 A: your faith is tested and and i i would have liked even right now actually [laughter] i wou- 

128.50 129.59 B: right 

132.38 139.17 A: i would like the future me to come back and say [laughter] it'll be okay [laughter] 

133.14 134.00 B: uh-huh 

137.91 139.18 B: right 

139.63 143.81 A: [laughter] but i wouldn't that wouldn't that's not really a change 

143.69 144.98 B: (( no )) 

143.94 145.81 A: i just want an affirmation 

145.84 152.07 B: no not at all but it i think it i think it would be really cool to go back or forward in time 

152.01 152.95 A: (( yeah it )) 

153.65 155.16 A: would be very cool 

155.31 161.97 B: i think i would go back to maybe the wild west or something like that where it when the last was untouched 

161.86 167.98 A: oh well you know what you know what would be cool is to go back to be before there was any life at all 

164.32 165.15 B: (( uh-huh )) 

168.07 169.58 B: (( oh yeah )) 

168.97 178.29 A: you know just kinda like funky stuff i mean i'd like to see dinosaurs and then maybe the egyptians when they were building the pyramid you 

178.12 179.70 B: that would be cool 

178.28 184.61 A: know i would just wanna kinda just hop around and just you know spend a week here a week there 

184.54 189.84 B: i wouldn't wanna stay back there though i'd want a guarantee that i'd make it back alive [laughter] 

188.66 194.16 A: oh absolutely i wouldn't do it if i had to stay but just i wanna visit 

195.06 200.11 A: you know i would actually okay i i do have one comment though 'cause when i 

195.87 196.90 B: yeah 

198.89 199.72 B: uh-huh 

200.28 205.39 A: i'm ah thirty one right and i was in a coma when i was twenty two and

207.92 209.70 B: (( [lipsmack] oh okay )) 

209.46 216.22 A: and when i came out of the coma i had just finished college and i was working my first year in my first real job 

216.05 224.89 A: and i hated it and i hated corporate america and i decided i wanted to model and i wound up racking up a whole bunch of credit card debt and i screwed up my credit because i thought 

218.59 219.48 B: mhm 

224.90 228.52 A: i could fix it quickly that's what i would change 

226.60 227.50 B: mhm 

228.60 233.45 A: i would go back in time and tell myself not to raise up my credit cards 

234.14 238.72 A: to charge up my credit cards it would have been easier to get a cheaper apartment or something like that 

235.22 236.37 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

238.46 240.54 B: right save or something 

240.22 243.63 A: or save i mean in in the grand scheme of things i was un-
