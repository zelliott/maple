32.01 35.64 A: i don't know i don't i don't i don't think i would i don't think i would take the million dollars i 

35.92 37.90 A: think i would 

36.73 38.27 B: i wouldn't either 

38.33 39.70 A: you don't think you would 

39.14 39.95 B: (( no )) 

41.17 42.07 B: i wouldn't 

42.84 43.90 B: why wouldn't you 

44.30 48.88 A: well i don't really have too many friends but the ones that i do have are very close to me 

48.95 50.01 A: um 

50.61 56.67 A: you know it's just a million dollars is a lot of money but you know i think i could probably do okay on my own 

56.78 62.03 A: you know i i would i would much rather have the moral support of you know having someone that i can talk too 

56.93 57.77 B: right 

62.17 65.01 A: when i need when i need help [laughter] 

65.15 66.50 B: how true 

65.95 67.91 A: (( ah what do you think )) 

67.38 68.35 B: (( um )) 

69.14 71.98 B: right now i would probably take the money 

73.04 75.45 B: just for the fact i need it but 

75.70 79.13 B: if i didn't need it i probably wouldn't for the friend's sake 

80.77 84.25 A: so you would you would you would also not take the money 

80.80 82.36 B: you can't find too many 

83.29 84.82 B: [mn] probably not 

85.57 89.42 B: the friends i've gained you can't replace them really 

90.19 91.79 A: right 

92.01 97.36 A: i don't know i mean it would be kind of fun to you know to go travel or something 

97.31 98.64 B: (( right but if you )) 

97.45 100.59 A: i guess i could move somewhere else and make new friends but 

99.88 102.53 B: can get all your friends together and raise up the money too 

103.31 109.45 A: yeah i mean i guess i would kind of suffer because most of my friends are are friends with each other so 

109.80 114.70 A: if there was one person in particular that i could not talk to but i could still talk to the others like that'd be kind of 

115.20 116.53 A: kind of crappy 

116.65 118.43 B: (( yeah that would be )) 

119.09 121.77 B: i don't know but then if you did have the money 

122.70 125.91 B: people just want to be your friends because you did have the money i think 

128.91 130.07 B: (( all right )) 

130.80 132.15 B: (( going good )) 

133.01 134.56 B: (( is that all we're supposed to do ))

138.08 139.79 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

139.16 140.11 A: okay 

140.51 144.17 A: yeah the deal is we've got to we've got to keep talking to get our ten dollars so 

144.48 145.62 B: [laughter] 

145.60 149.42 A: ironically enough you know we're doing this for ten dollars instead of a million dollars 

146.93 147.99 B: (( great )) 

149.22 153.01 B: right i'm not really doing anything anyway money and still 

153.78 154.91 A: right 

154.23 156.26 B: (( i couldn't do that )) 

156.07 161.72 A: i don't know it's an interesting question to ask all the students well i guess are are are you a are you a college student or 

159.24 160.81 B: (( are you in college or not )) 

161.67 164.44 B: no i'm already out mhm

200.22 201.46 A: [laughter] 

201.18 202.19 B: [laughter] 

202.00 207.86 A: yeah it's kind of weird i i hope they're not going to get upset at us for not talking about the million dollar thing 

203.41 204.44 B: (( cool )) 

208.51 209.70 B: i they listening 

209.84 211.60 A: yeah well they're recording this 

213.00 215.84 B: oh but see the money is so important though 

216.08 217.60 A: yeah [laughter] 

216.78 218.82 B: [laughter] 

219.32 220.30 B: um 

220.70 224.06 B: okay i didn't know we're supposed to talk about one thing for ten minutes 

225.42 227.33 A: yeah um 

229.22 230.87 A: (( i don't know i guess ah )) 

231.30 232.35 B: [laughter] 

231.36 234.98 A: i guess we could talk about what we'd do if we did get the money instead of 

234.32 235.22 B: okay 

235.16 236.34 A: um 

238.94 243.36 A: i don't know i think i would definitely travel for a while and then i i would probably move 

243.58 246.63 A: out of the south i really don't like living in georgia [laughter] 

246.53 247.74 B: i feel for ya 

249.03 250.98 A: i think i'd probably move like 

251.34 255.23 A: washington or canada or maybe france 

255.32 256.76 B: canada's cooler 

257.41 259.52 B: it's just a million dollars though huh 

260.88 264.42 B: i'd probably buy a teeny car and a house 

265.62 267.88 A: yeah do you think you'd buy a house 

267.64 269.87 B: yeah i'd buy a couple of houses 

270.07 271.53 B: and a new boat 

270.16 271.05 A: yeah 

272.80 274.29 B: (( yeah that's what i'd do )) 

274.45 281.04 A: yeah i definitely wouldn't want to just spend it [laughter] spend it all i guess i probably maybe spend like a 

281.17 284.39 A: a l l l little bit of it and then just put the rest away 

284.73 287.54 A: 'cause it'd be nice to not have to work for a year or two [laughter] 

287.34 290.40 B: yeah huh i'd throw that alarm clock right out the window 

291.12 294.83 B: and i could just wave to the people on the street i could wave to my friends 

294.76 296.12 A: [laughter] 

295.31 297.48 B: 'cause that's not talking is it waving 

298.44 299.90 A: i wonder if that counts 

299.70 300.92 B: sign language 

301.52 303.20 A: yeah 

302.26 303.92 B: (( [laughter] i don't know )) 

304.95 305.88 B: (( hm so )) 

306.09 313.56 A: you know what i'm wondering i'm wondering who would enforce that you know 'cause if this is some benefactor that you know i mean that's probably somebody who died i guess 

313.99 316.30 B: we went in there because they're anonymous 

317.20 318.34 A: i don't know 

318.65 324.35 A: i wonder if there'd be somebody to check up on you and like secretly take the money back if they find out you're talking to your friend 

323.73 324.87 B: hoo hoo 

325.65 327.93 B: figure i'd spend it quick [laughter] 

328.40 333.24 B: they didn't they didn't say that we couldn't talk to them after we had the money 

335.90 337.43 B: i'm getting too technical 

336.05 337.01 A: right 

340.35 343.26 B: as if they're going to offer someone seriously that much money 

344.48 345.49 B: [laughter] 

344.79 351.82 A: i don't know maybe maybe that's maybe that's like an ulterior motive maybe that's what this study is actually about that they're looking for somebody to give a million dollars to 

351.78 354.43 B: [laughter] 

353.53 357.26 A: and whoever whoever has the best explanation in ten minutes maybe that's who gets it 

357.06 363.50 B: pick me pick me no we can't we don't really we're not that smart out here so they probably wouldn't pick anybody from here what's 

366.07 368.21 B: (( that get the surfboard )) 

368.34 371.64 B: [laughter] well oh i'd be a new surfboard too that's what i'd do th 

373.47 376.80 B: that'd be good you guys don't have a beach there huh 

378.47 379.95 A: i'm i'm sorry

396.14 401.40 B: no i thought georgia was near the ocean i i'm thinking carolina right now

411.38 412.56 B: yeah [laughter] 

412.20 413.75 A: interesting 

412.97 416.33 B: (( so i wonder how many people are going to be doing this it's tricky )) 

417.30 418.32 A: (( i don't know )) 

417.97 420.53 B: i want to know how long it takes for that cheque to get here

439.77 445.61 B: exactly that's what i'm saying [laughter] all right um 

447.12 450.76 B: i think they're just listening to how like we 

451.70 454.10 B: (( pronounce words or like just )) 

454.41 458.13 B: just like speech in general like how like 

459.23 461.44 B: ah just speech in general 

461.46 464.80 B: and then just topics to see what kind of words we use to 

465.97 466.83 B: talk 

468.04 474.22 A: i don't know i mean they're probably not just looking for the answers that'd be a kind of silly research project 

468.86 469.72 B: i think 

473.73 474.86 B: (( yeah i )) 

475.34 477.68 B: wonder where they're getting all this money too 

478.00 480.60 A: i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure somebody got a grant 

478.10 479.46 B: they obviously have money 

480.87 484.71 A: and they just put half of it aside you know it'd be like all right 

484.79 485.74 B: yeah 

484.88 490.36 A: we've got to pay this participants like 'cause i mean 'cause i've done i've done studies like this before ah for

489.45 490.84 B: (( oh yeah )) 

490.49 493.41 A: yeah but not not over the phone um 

493.42 497.66 A: like i i'm a i'm a student at georgia tech um 

495.94 496.71 B: oh 

497.85 508.01 A: and their psychology department has they they do stuff like this where you know they put up a sign be like you know make a hundred dollars go sit down and study and you know you got to go for like eight weeks or whatever and 

507.40 508.32 B: (( mhm )) 

508.61 509.59 A: do 

509.61 511.88 A: random psychology tasks 

512.06 513.12 A: um 

513.93 517.46 B: if it's something that doesn't get too personal i'd do it 

514.02 514.95 A: it usually 

517.68 522.18 A: yeah well i mean the the thing about it was is like it's usually um 

523.93 533.24 A: usually whatever you're doing is not what they're actually researching like the just get you to do something else and like make you think that that's really what's going on 

533.25 534.55 A: yeah 

533.94 535.34 B: (( ah )) 

535.19 541.95 A: yeah you know that you know that they're actually studying completely different but they just want to see your reaction to a particular situation 

542.16 543.13 A: um 

543.12 548.14 B: yeah 'cause that does seem kind of like a funny question to ask the money situation 

547.74 549.88 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

549.26 550.75 B: maybe you're on to something 

551.14 552.97 B: huh
