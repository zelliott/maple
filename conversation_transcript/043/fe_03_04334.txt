79.93 82.58 B: um i don't know that's a that's a tough one because uh 

83.11 86.46 B: even stuff that i've been through bad like i've always said i wouldn't change anything because it's 

86.60 87.21 B: everything 

87.49 88.38 B: le- li- 

88.51 92.95 B: le- led up to where what i am today like if i changed something i wouldn't be what i am today 

93.40 95.69 B: i mean not not that it's anything great or anything but 

96.16 99.92 B: you know even the hardships have made me stronger in certain situations so 

100.28 101.62 B: so all no like uh 

102.18 103.84 B: it's kind of weird you know because i i 

104.11 104.53 B: eh 

104.94 107.59 B: i i'm thinking of something like maybe i've done bad or something but 

108.01 108.82 B: it's just uh 

109.78 112.71 A: well you know that's actually a an interesting um 

113.85 115.55 A: thought process you had because 

116.12 118.08 A: uh i i my my boyfriend has 

118.43 121.25 A: this guy is the hardest working most diligent 

121.45 127.83 A: most straight-laced guy that you could ever meet most honest guy a- anybody would love to have him as an employee but he keeps getting laid off and he's 

128.32 129.94 A: (( he'll accept )) the careers that 

130.17 133.24 A: people can get laid off but he has a really good attitude and he doesn't 

133.49 134.28 A: he's not bitter 

134.73 135.86 A: and uh has 

135.99 140.24 A: had a l- just a real mature guy because of it and i think in just like your situation 

140.75 141.60 A: you can either take 

141.80 146.25 A: bad things that have happened and become extremely bitter and you know lots of bitter people you know 

146.01 146.85 B: right right 

146.42 146.70 A: an- 

146.82 149.05 A: an- and they're the ones who usually end up on the front 

149.48 153.45 A: lo- front pages of the news from having shot somebody or whatever 

153.18 153.78 B: right 

153.77 157.22 A: uh eh or you could take it and and use it to a positive thing 

157.80 158.70 A: uh a- and 

159.04 162.58 A: um gosh i i feel really sorry for folks who have 

163.34 167.13 A: hard times and then they don't have a positive attitude like yours and say well 

167.55 168.55 A: that it shaped me and it 

168.94 171.91 A: built my character or it's made me a better person it's made me mature or 

172.29 173.00 A: whatever and it's 

173.19 175.03 A: bad thing to live with that kind of bitterness i would 

174.88 176.74 B: i know it and plus you can't change the 

176.87 177.57 B: the past 

177.68 182.81 B: you know so that's why like um this is kind of weird for me because i hate when people say oh if i only 

184.52 185.03 A: right 

186.47 187.18 A: r- right 

189.89 192.34 B: that's why it's kind of weird for me i'm wondering what this is um 

192.66 193.15 B: about because 

193.41 196.15 B: that's one thing it's like if this if that well 

196.57 205.29 B: you know i always said well if the queen had balls she'd be king you know so it's i- you can't change one minor thing without changing the whole scheme of it 

200.31 201.96 A: yeah yeah ri- 

203.76 206.31 A: yeah you're right 

205.79 209.48 B: you know so it's like i ha- i just i hate when people do that it's like oh if 

216.26 221.35 B: that's why it's weird for me i wouldn't change anything y- y- you know i'm jus- i'm even thinking as we're talking i- i'm thinking 

221.62 222.12 B: even the 

222.70 226.25 B: you know i went through kind of a bitter divorce and everything i wouldn't even change that just because 

222.91 223.16 A: eh 

225.80 226.38 A: wow 

226.41 226.91 B: you know 

227.02 227.61 A: wow 

227.72 228.49 B: but uh 

228.02 229.55 A: wow that really says a lot now 

229.72 232.69 A: d- are are you a person of faith d- d- do y- is th- 

232.01 232.88 B: yes i am 

232.94 234.99 A: oh okay are are you a christian or 

235.10 242.09 B: christian but i wasn't alw- i mean i was always a christian but i never really believed until just recently after actually when things got easier 

235.20 235.87 A: eh 

242.71 248.66 B: uh you know um i've just became more mature in my faith as far as like a- attending regularly and stuff where 

248.78 251.21 B: before when things were going crazy i wasn't 

251.34 254.05 B: but um but i don't think i i went because of 

254.98 255.46 B: um 

255.61 258.69 B: things were bad i went when things were better actually you know what i mean 

259.36 265.54 B: you know like when i felt comfortable because i was more relaxed and stuff and th- thinking about things and thinking that maybe it's time to 

266.12 266.53 B: to 

266.54 267.28 A: to go back 

266.82 268.13 B: be mature yeah 

268.66 275.51 A: well eh but eh th- i guess do you do you i'm a person of faith myself and and so i i yes definitely definitely and i've been 

272.65 273.20 B: christian 

275.82 277.39 A: really fortunate that um 

285.11 285.72 B: right 

285.40 285.76 A: um 

286.17 287.01 A: you know i had a lot of 

287.14 292.94 A: great christian friends and then the- it's kind of slowly brought me back and then there was a a period where i went abroad 

293.22 294.23 A: for a whole year and it 

294.42 302.52 A: y- you know you come from a an extremely baptist university where all the rules are strict and then you go abroad knowing you can do whatever you want and so then you see then you see what 

300.09 301.33 B: right ri- 

302.82 303.91 A: what side of the fence you're going to 

304.37 306.33 A: sit on and sometimes the faith comes 

307.25 310.79 A: so quietly and in such little steps like yourse- like yourself and then 

311.14 315.08 A: all of the sudden one day you know you suddenly realize well this is the side of the fence i'm on 

315.45 317.58 A: and uh that that's interesting that that 

317.76 319.05 A: that that you kind of 

319.87 324.71 A: started g- going back after when things are easier but do you do you kind of see how 

324.94 327.47 A: perhaps god maybe maybe had had his hand in 

327.57 328.53 A: the horrible events 

328.97 339.35 B: oh absolutely i mean because he was with me all the way i feel like now that uh um you know because otherwise they wouldn't have survived it you know just every just everything that was going on but uh um 

335.98 336.52 A: oh sure 

339.91 344.26 B: yeah i definitely do see that and i try to be in tune to like my 

345.45 345.74 B: like 

345.97 347.03 B: spirit led 

347.31 350.66 B: you know because i'm always trying to figure out everything for myself as far as like 

350.81 351.66 B: you know what what 

352.03 353.28 B: i don't know the best answer 

353.43 355.36 B: so i have to kind of give it up and 

353.66 354.14 A: sure 

355.54 356.11 B: and let 

356.75 359.14 B: that's one of the hardest things to do is let let somebody 

359.31 359.81 B: like let 

359.94 360.19 B: uh 

360.56 369.46 B: god be my guide because i can't see or talk to her you know i mean it's not tangible really to your to my face and it's kind of weird to uh 

370.54 377.61 B: i- i- it was hard for me not weird but just hard to just let go and let god but um and sometimes i just have to go with something that doesn't necessarily 

377.95 378.91 B: agree with me but 

379.26 382.12 B: and then i find out it is for the better because i don't really know what's going on 

382.09 388.93 A: yeah exactly and uh w- well you know i i can tell you th- there was a a uh a period three years ago that i had a 

389.20 390.41 A: really big job offer 

390.67 391.35 A: with 

391.57 396.70 A: american airlines and uh they offered me the job in the elevator and they gave my 

393.10 393.51 B: oh 

396.82 399.81 A: i was on my way to a vacation with my mom and they 

399.97 401.02 A: they saw where my 

401.13 407.38 A: my mother's and my record was on the machine they gave me first class tickets they gave me a job offer i said i'll be back in three weeks i'll 

407.67 412.50 A: i'll give you an answer once i see it on paper and they never came back with the paper they they ended up cutting the funding 

412.86 419.79 A: and then thank god y- y- uh you know if i had gone with them and now look what's happened you know to them and and then 

418.38 419.32 B: right right 

420.11 426.11 A: another company g._t._e. um if i had gone with them the next in seven months they were a- after you know i didn't make it 

426.45 428.81 A: i didn't get a final offer they uh 

429.29 431.44 A: they got bought out by verizon they shipped all their 

432.34 433.90 A: professionals in my profession 

434.21 444.54 A: to stamford connecticut (( horrendous )) yeah yeah and so this and even right now i i got put into the finals of a a really really terrific job and i though oh it's going to 

435.95 436.61 B: oh 

444.65 447.28 A: you know help me pay for the wedding it's going to eh all you know 

447.62 453.14 A: going to be all these fabulous things and it's a huge fifty percent raise in pay and i got to the finals and i though surely and then 

453.41 459.60 A: you know i found out yesterday i didn't get it and i'm tremendously disappointed and my boyfriend was here tonight to console me because i was so disappointed but 

459.86 461.76 A: but an- and i know j- jus- 

461.99 463.50 A: like you you were saying is that 

463.25 464.39 B: there's a bigger picture 

463.67 463.98 A: it 

464.69 470.02 A: yeah it's a bigger picture but you know you're still like oh my god i got in the finals this is the perfect job i loved all these people and 

470.25 472.96 A: i don't know what it is and it doesn't sometimes it doesn't help the dis- 

473.07 474.04 A: -pointment at the time 

474.24 476.72 B: right i know yeah and it's it is kind of 

476.92 479.34 B: but you'll look back later and say oh that's why 

479.43 480.40 A: yeah because they'll (( get )) 

479.78 482.22 B: and it's hard to see it when when it's happening 

482.50 485.16 A: well sure and you don't know what you're being protected from doing 

485.24 486.15 B: right right 

485.77 486.02 A: but 

486.42 490.22 A: well you know um since neither of us probably would change it a whole lot in our own lives 

490.31 490.65 A: um 

491.10 492.29 A: do you think there's a 

492.46 494.29 A: a something within like 

494.41 499.49 A: your your lifetime like for instance when kennedy got shot or something like that do you is there something in history 

500.41 502.65 A: in a hypothetical situation that you would 

502.89 503.27 A: you wish 

503.44 505.35 A: hadn't happened like something mementos 

505.56 506.05 A: like that 

507.18 507.74 B: um 

508.53 509.04 B: i think 

509.88 510.39 B: um 

510.75 515.22 B: i think the whole thing with the hitlerism and the nazism i think that was so atrocious 

515.76 516.54 B: that um 

517.04 519.97 B: i can't imagine that nobody stopped him 

520.19 521.00 B: at the time 

521.16 523.10 B: you know i guess i don't i did- 

523.37 527.02 B: i don't know what the excuse is i've been reading a lot of books on that because the- the- there's it's a um 

527.58 530.84 B: it's a a subject that fascinated me about it but uh 

530.16 530.48 A: uh-huh 

531.57 534.04 B: but that was so atrocious to so many people 

534.56 534.88 B: that 

534.65 537.29 A: and so many people were so blind to that 

537.78 538.52 B: i know 

538.74 539.03 B: and 

539.30 542.75 A: yeah i mean remember they ha- they hid the fact that there was actually concentration camp 

542.85 544.84 A: from most of the world for a really really long time 

551.13 551.95 B: on the scene 

552.09 554.08 B: i can't imagine that many people were just 

554.46 559.03 B: blindfolded into just obeying where i don't i think to myself like if somebody told me to 

559.19 560.07 B: kill that many 

560.27 560.79 B: like put 

560.88 562.42 B: thirty people into co- in in a 

562.99 563.80 B: gas chamber 

564.00 565.49 B: i don't know if i'd be able to do that 

567.23 568.35 B: that's a that's a tough thing 

567.59 571.74 A: an- yeah yeah all those people were able to do it you know all the guards 

570.31 571.23 B: i know that's 

571.46 575.86 B: that's to me is like too so weird like that that nobody had a conscience for that 

576.74 577.01 A: eh 

584.17 590.84 A: fifty soldiers beneath him and and these fifty soldiers were doing all the dirty work you would think that somebody would just say this is terrible and let's 

590.96 594.41 A: let's take out the commander let's let all these people free because they could have done it 

594.22 595.50 B: i know i know 

595.93 596.58 B: that's that's 

596.16 598.12 A: but they didn't
