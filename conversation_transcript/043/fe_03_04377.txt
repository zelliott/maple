40.25 43.42 A: you know if i'd ever gotten rich how could i trust somebody 

43.35 44.70 B: absolutely

60.62 72.68 B: they said that ah pretty much they're no more happy than they were before because you know i- in fact usually less so simply for that reason because so many of their friends drift away 

72.69 79.76 A: yeah [cough] i was just so used to thinking if ah if i'd ever gotten that kind of money that ah 

73.19 74.32 B: (( and yeah mm )) 

80.36 84.01 A: in order to find out whether or not the people that i 

84.29 87.22 A: i was with were truly you know 

87.44 95.67 A: truly my friends or simply you know simply not after the money i would have to actually create an alternative lifestyle for myself 

91.14 91.95 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

96.01 104.39 A: you know have the big fancy house you know with all that but when you go out to meet people and you bring 'em home take 'em to the trailer park [laughter]

118.74 121.68 A: hm 

120.40 131.44 B: ah just to see how people would react um once they found you know how they treated him when they thought he was a garbage man versus later on in the night when he was like actually i'm a psychiatrist and then 

131.51 134.76 B: they were like ah the difference in how people treated him 

134.94 136.61 B: was pretty staggering mhm 

135.04 138.28 A: hm people's people's perceptions are 

139.45 141.19 A: skewed by 

141.50 143.64 A: by what they think you do 

141.55 142.36 B: yeah 

143.37 145.18 B: absolutely i wonder

248.09 249.17 B: right 

248.53 251.41 A: but it it's a matter of micro management 

250.77 251.77 B: right

271.87 273.64 A: [laughter] 

273.10 279.37 B: maybe hire somebody to watch the child and occupy my wife 

274.34 275.44 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

278.67 292.14 A: yeah but but but you know which one would you consider your best friend would that count you know your spouse i mean i don't know you know most of my friends who are married may have started off

284.96 286.26 B: yeah i know 

292.21 295.00 A: considering their spouse to be their best friend but 

294.36 295.26 B: right

298.51 299.46 B: yeah 

299.55 304.17 A: you know so now they get more satisfaction with hanging out with the guys or whatever 

303.68 306.67 B: yeah well i mean i think um 

306.98 309.21 B: [lipsmack] i think most people 

309.67 322.92 B: in the the early stages of romance and certainly in the first few years of marriage are like oh you know my partner has to be everything and it's it can't last and one person can't 

321.18 329.41 A: well that that's probably also a large part of what has to be a contributing factor to the high rate of divorce 

328.71 330.58 B: oh absolutely 

329.95 336.80 A: people get these fantasy marriages in their head and and when it doesn't live up to it they get to the point they can give up 

336.21 340.10 B: yeah yeah but it can't it can't live up to

489.85 492.85 B: oh ho this sounds like northern exposure ah gee 

492.20 497.90 A: okay so and the odds are even if you order it you're still not gonna get exactly what you want 

499.49 503.41 A: and ah a lot of it has to do i think with um 

503.96 506.87 A: well it it's it's all cultural but you know
