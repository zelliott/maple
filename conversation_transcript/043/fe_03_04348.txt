0.22 1.26 A: (( hello )) 

0.70 2.17 B: hello 

2.26 3.76 A: my name is kim 

3.42 6.19 B: hi my name is keithres how are you 

5.67 7.34 A: what a pretty name 

6.84 8.06 B: (( thank you )) 

7.89 9.65 A: (( never heard of it )) 

8.90 18.31 B: [laughter] it's feminine of keith my father's name was keith and my mom just added r. e. s. as it made it feminine and keithres came 

18.14 22.14 A: oh gee that's very thoughtful that was that was clever 

19.47 21.22 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

21.72 23.41 B: yeah [laughter] 

22.99 24.45 A: that was real clever 

23.88 29.43 B: (( yeah so now what are we talking about if who gave us a million dollars )) 

28.89 39.43 A: i didn't hear it very clearly because i couldn't understand what the wo- the voice said if somebody gave you a million dollars and you couldn't talk to your best friend would you take it 

38.82 41.44 B: yeah okay that's what i heard also 

41.58 44.03 B: um would you like to begin 

44.37 45.64 A: i would take it 

45.39 46.53 B: (( you would okay )) 

46.09 47.96 A: maybe [laughter] 

47.04 49.45 B: okay i could i could 

48.65 55.50 A: i i i could i have a few best friends but they they'd have to stipulate which best friend that i couldn't talk to 

54.27 57.50 B: oh okay see that makes sense 

57.18 61.07 A: they didn't say that i couldn't talk to one see they didn't specify 

59.11 60.22 B: right 

60.60 61.83 B: uh-huh 

61.92 66.36 B: that's true too that's true well i don't know i mean 

67.42 75.01 B: i don't have a lot of best friends i may have two that i can really count on for any any anything 

74.74 75.73 A: well 

75.08 76.85 B: and i don't know if 

77.28 78.08 A: hello 

77.32 82.16 B: if that million dollars would be worth giving them up 

82.21 87.96 B: i don't i don't think so because throughout my life i've had a couple of people who have 

87.81 100.86 B: thought they were my best friends but when situations got really hectic or maybe i ran out of money [laughter] you know in financial distress they were no longer around 

92.10 94.29 A: yes i know i've had 

100.06 101.77 A: a- well see i i 

102.15 106.15 A: i've had a i've had a few in my lifetime 

105.75 106.96 B: (( mhm )) 

106.33 111.72 A: but it depends for me it d- would depend maybe on who the best friend might be 

111.10 112.98 B: okay okay 

111.93 116.99 A: but and in some ways i probably wouldn't because my 

115.61 116.80 B: mhm 

117.24 119.07 A: i'm very loyal 

118.62 120.41 B: mhm 

119.76 121.28 A: to my best friend 

120.68 122.68 B: mhm 

122.80 136.02 B: mhm yeah i because i think once you have a best friend because i think people misunderstand that best friend and then my interpretation of a best friend is somebody that you can talk to about anything 

135.89 145.83 B: without among other things without judging you and so many people these days you know like when you read a topic or something they judge you 

145.97 155.00 B: you know and and i'm guilty of that too i've been that way also that you know if something they're talking about something and i've maybe surpassed that particular 

146.53 147.32 A: right 

154.98 162.97 B: area in my life and i'm like well you know how could you and and it's so often and when i begin to do that 

163.15 172.79 B: i experience the same thing they're feeling and i could never say never again so i think that once you do get a best friend it's it's so valuable 

169.99 171.14 A: that's right 

172.23 181.87 A: because i've ha- i've had a few things in my lifetime that i've had to go through that i thought were my friends and they've been with me all that time so i went through 

176.64 177.67 B: uh-huh 

180.35 181.41 B: uh-huh 

181.96 186.09 A: such trauma and things that i to do they dropped me like a hot potato 

182.95 183.85 B: mhm 

185.24 187.62 B: mhm mhm 

186.69 190.97 A: and i thought well i thought you were my friend i guess you really weren't my friend 

188.71 189.99 B: right 

190.31 192.23 B: right right 

191.55 196.33 A: but i have i have a real good friend here where i am and 

195.41 196.68 B: oh great 

196.43 201.33 A: i would not give her up for anything god put put her in my life for a reason 

198.24 199.27 B: oh 

200.19 204.46 B: yeah what a blessing what where are you where are you what state are you in 

204.13 205.34 A: virginia 

204.75 207.76 B: oh okay okay i'm in new jersey 

207.31 209.26 A: ew you can keep new jersey 

208.66 211.42 B: [laughter] 

210.97 213.72 A: (( i'm sorry but i don't like new jersey )) 

213.38 214.73 B: (( have you been here )) 

214.94 216.68 A: i have been through it 

216.26 217.27 B: okay 

216.81 219.03 A: i just don't care for it 

218.26 220.73 B: yeah yeah 

220.09 221.54 A: it's not my ah 

221.96 230.00 B: well we were i'm from new york actually and my f- my family and i moved here three years ago we built our house next door to my sister 

229.95 236.84 B: and um she is like not she's not really my blood sister she's like a sister like i said she's was one of my best friends 

236.29 237.16 A: uh-huh 

236.65 246.21 B: but i'm saying the it's so funny that this topic came up because once you live next door to somebody you see them for who they really really are 

245.75 246.73 A: right 

246.09 260.00 B: and when you have well see when i was in new york and she was here i didn't get a chance to see her daily activities and daily routine so you only know what a person tells you until you live next door to them then everything comes out 

259.94 262.68 B: so i've just learned you know to be 

259.95 260.76 A: right 

260.95 262.10 A: [laughter] 

262.95 277.67 B: i guess not guarded but like you said when some yeah cautious that's a great word that when you know you're cautious about things and you've you you analyze well really what is a best friend or do you like me because i have money now 

265.49 266.48 A: cautious 

277.57 292.21 B: do you like me because my dad died and you know you see what i'm saying it's like you have to really i don't know like i guess you said your best friend you guys are really really close and that's a blessing when god puts somebody in your life that doesn't judge you 

281.56 282.46 A: right 

292.72 294.18 B: do you feel that oh my 

293.02 298.07 A: my my best friend my new best friend we've been friends for about nine months now 

298.62 300.22 B: (( god that's fantastic ))
