0.15 1.47 B: hello i'm joe 

1.23 2.71 A: hi i'm dave 

3.36 8.05 A: um that's a pretty tough question but ah think it'd be 

7.22 8.49 B: yeah 

8.34 14.39 A: difficult to just give up a friend and i'd like the million dollars but 

15.05 16.98 A: not so sure i could do that [laughter] 

16.67 19.29 B: yeah depends how close they are to you 

18.96 20.27 A: yeah 

19.55 22.18 B: [laughter] could by your wife you know [laughter] 

21.20 24.08 A: [laughter] 

23.62 25.29 B: who knows right 

24.55 25.86 A: right 

26.14 29.04 B: ah ten million dol- er a million dollars though 

29.15 31.48 A: yeah it'd be nice to have 

30.79 32.44 B: (( yeah it would [laughter] yeah )) 

31.63 32.52 A: [laughter] 

35.91 41.94 A: um you know what i'm not exactly did did they say just a friend or a best friend 

41.25 42.93 B: a best friend yeah 

42.26 43.33 A: best friend 

43.81 44.56 A: (( okay )) 

45.55 46.57 A: um 

46.82 48.51 A: i don't think i could do it [laughter] 

48.03 50.16 B: yeah i it'd be tough for me too 

50.74 53.38 A: i'd like to be able to though [laughter] 

52.22 56.04 B: [laughter] take the million dollars right yep huh 

54.40 55.58 A: yeah 

57.77 58.79 B: (( oh )) 

59.34 64.47 B: yeah so it would depend on how long you knew them too and what type of relationship you probably have with them 

64.47 66.76 A: mm yeah um 

69.48 76.52 A: [lipsmack] isn't that kind of opportunity for for th- that kind of money coming that easily doesn't come along every day 

76.41 77.51 B: yeah 

76.92 82.59 A: but it would be a difficult decision but still got a feeling the answer would be no 

82.22 83.57 B: yeah i would too 

85.37 87.60 B: what would you do with it [laughter] 

87.15 91.75 A: i don't know but i'd sure like to have it to have the problem of trying to figure it out [laughter] 

91.18 93.36 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

97.33 102.17 B: maybe ah take down osama bin laden instead right 

101.14 104.58 A: yeah well that would be easy that's a no brainer hm 

104.20 106.28 B: no brainer there yep 

117.88 122.99 A: well you you asked me what i would do with the million you any any idea what you would do with it 

122.73 123.96 B: (( um ah )) 

124.67 128.97 B: i don't know i'm at school right now so i'd probably pay for tuition and all that 

128.39 134.93 A: yeah well probably have a little left over after that i know tuition's expensive i don't think it's that expensive 

130.94 132.15 B: [laughter] 

134.34 136.44 B: no not that expensive 

136.89 137.92 B: how about you 

137.89 143.03 A: [laughter] ah boy i think probably first thing i'd do would be 

143.07 148.78 A: pay off the house and probably look for a nice car [laughter] 

147.83 149.72 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

150.11 154.86 A: school's been over for a while for me so i i don't have that problem 

153.98 155.48 B: yep 

156.21 158.46 B: well you'd pick up something pretty nice 

158.41 159.87 A: yeah 

158.61 159.19 B: (( [noise] ))

169.78 171.68 A: mhm 

179.61 183.63 A: right yeah trying to think where we should go with this conversation 

183.16 184.33 B: yeah 

183.74 185.00 A: um 

186.17 187.23 A: (( well you know )) 

187.44 199.58 A: it it's not really one that i think i can find a lot of conversation to make because i think it's fairly clear cut i've although i'd i'd like to be able to take the take them up on the offer 

189.75 190.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

199.76 201.64 A: and have a million dollars i 

202.03 210.78 A: really don't think that i would just give up a best friend for no reason well it's not for no reason but [laughter] for no good reason 

209.05 209.91 B: yeah 

214.83 220.22 B: yeah i mean it's sort of like sacrificing that relationship for you know monetary 

220.36 221.65 A: yeah 

220.73 229.42 B: expenses i guess it depends [laughter] you know maybe if you were a street bum or something you know you probably wouldn't think think anything of it but 

223.32 224.25 A: mhm 

228.12 230.64 A: no you'd jump right in on that one 

230.16 232.39 B: yeah [laughter] hm [laughter] 

232.04 234.93 A: that would be easy if you didn't have a best friend 

234.33 236.80 B: [laughter] the the guy who gives me a 

237.19 242.25 B: gives me the socks everyday or or the million dollars which one will i choose you know 

241.42 243.65 A: [laughter] 

248.22 248.99 A: (( well )) 

250.36 252.58 B: mm it's pretty clear cut though i mean 

253.09 255.63 B: not really open to too much interpretation 

257.07 258.11 A: no i 

258.13 264.51 A: i mean i did one of these before i don't recall what the topic was but i do 'cause it's been a while but i i do recall 

264.58 270.74 A: [lipsmack] being able to have a conversation because it it wasn't a clear cut topic 

270.47 272.23 B: yeah 

271.67 274.19 A: i mean but i i really do think this one is 

276.01 280.55 B: what if it was maybe like a work colleague i mean the- then the case would probably 

278.98 280.05 A: that 

280.11 288.40 A: that i think i could do and there there's some i would like to um without the million dollars [laughter] to be able to do that [cough] 

281.37 282.41 B: yeah 

285.38 287.00 B: [laughter] 

288.15 289.93 B: yeah 

290.04 295.98 B: do you think that would cause a problem in the workplace maybe work place relationships i don't know 

296.06 298.15 A: to some extent i think 

297.53 298.75 B: yeah 

298.31 299.94 A: (( but ah i'm ))

347.18 350.90 B: i haven't done too many of these types of interviews um ah 

350.93 352.98 B: that much but occasionally 

352.88 353.96 A: (( yeah mm )) 

353.00 354.38 B: along the same lines 

355.74 358.46 A: for the most part i find it interesting 

357.86 363.79 B: yeah it is it's ah to talk about well the topic and see where it goes you know true [noise] 

363.23 364.04 A: true 

373.79 378.42 A: i'm trying to think what what other discussion there could be on on this topic 

378.91 380.75 A: but i'm having difficulty 

382.39 387.16 B: (( yeah um )) 

389.78 391.84 A: (( suppose ah i mean if )) 

391.91 401.49 A: if [sigh] if it weren't a best friend you know just a a friend or acquaintance then it then it i could see some leeway there and be able to say well 

401.44 408.77 A: gee i sure would like the money i i could buy myself that sports car that nah i don't need him you know [laughter] 

405.87 406.93 B: yeah 

407.30 408.66 B: [laughter] 

408.89 411.79 B: he wasn't doing any me any good anyway right 

410.73 412.23 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

412.79 415.46 B: (( yeah then then i could see that )) 

415.70 419.68 B: but somebody you've been close to for a long time you know 

420.02 421.75 B: it's a little harder to do 

421.55 427.55 A: yeah well there and people i i would call close friends have been 

427.88 431.26 A: just that close friends for a long time 

431.00 436.61 B: yeah and then they find out what you're doing you know and [laughter] 

436.22 438.79 A: and they're not friends at all anymore [laughter] 

437.95 441.23 B: (( yeah i [laughter] )) 

441.59 443.86 B: and then it ends it all right 

443.12 444.64 A: mhm 

443.91 444.82 B: yeah 

456.87 459.45 B: hm where else can we go with this 

473.39 476.42 B: makes a good psychological experiment right [laughter] 

475.79 480.54 A: what do you yeah it causes some thought but but um 

479.14 481.85 B: yeah causes some deep thought and 

481.36 481.92 A: (( [cough] )) 

482.63 483.99 B: [laughter] 

484.27 489.06 B: maybe consi- makes you consider who your close friends are possibly or 

488.87 492.20 A: yep well actually i think it makes you think a little about yourself too [laughter] you 

491.74 492.76 B: yeah 

492.42 495.67 A: know it kinda would could well could i be like that 

495.23 500.01 B: yeah exactly i'm sure there are people like that though you know i mean 

499.32 500.04 A: oh 

500.09 503.63 B: situations come like that probably daily you know 

503.60 507.11 A: mhm yeah and that's well it's 

507.13 513.47 A: i- if you were in a desperate monetary situation that could influence the decision too 

513.20 514.45 B: yeah that's true 

528.44 532.77 A: apparently not neither of us feel as that desperate for money [laughter] 

533.04 535.53 B: no [laughter] 

537.66 539.06 B: not right now 

541.16 553.23 B: though we th- though we really haven't giv- haven't wer- weren't given the situation but you know [laughter] i guess it would me and you we would take the money right [laughter] hands down 

547.30 548.93 A: right 

552.31 556.82 A: would well it yeah not that i have anything against you but [laughter] 

556.61 557.73 B: same here 

557.18 564.84 A: [laughter] and yeah sure i'd i would somebody you'd never spoken to would you would you take the money for that yes i would [laughter] 

563.66 566.48 B: yes yeah [laughter] that's true 

565.16 567.14 A: well you don't have to think about that 

566.60 567.90 B: (( [laughter] )) 

568.85 574.07 B: but then again someone you see every day it presents a little different situation 

575.10 576.23 B: definitely 

583.03 586.13 A: (( mhm )) 

594.71 597.47 A: now if you were in a bad marriage 

597.84 599.89 A: (( that would ))
