6.60 7.74 B: yes 

7.31 8.91 A: (( hi this is ann )) 

9.41 11.82 A: phone i'm sorry is 

10.79 11.93 B: that's okay 

11.88 13.02 A: that better 

12.67 14.21 B: yes much better 

13.72 17.28 A: yeah you can hear me good on speakerphone that's a good topic huh 

16.91 20.17 B: yes it is oh yes it is 

19.87 22.76 A: i'm not sure i i'd have to think about that one 

23.56 26.75 A: i guess if they were truly a good best friend 

26.88 30.14 A: and everybody wants a million dollars they would have to 

30.50 31.39 A: you know ah 

30.65 32.25 B: understand 

32.02 33.10 A: what's that 

32.73 36.44 B: you mean if they're really your best friend they would understand 

35.79 38.04 A: yeah i would think so 

39.14 40.24 B: (( well )) 

40.37 47.56 B: they didn't say whether or not you can tell them that you the stipulation was if you went if you keep this money you can't 

47.64 51.85 B: talk to the best friend they didn't say you can tell the best friend that right 

51.92 54.16 A: that's true that's a good point [lipsmack] 

54.45 56.67 A: if i couldn't tell 'em i wouldn't do it 

56.86 59.26 A: it's not being a best friend you know 

59.33 60.99 B: that's a hard one 

61.20 67.13 A: but if they were truly a best friend they would want you to be happy and have whatever you needed in life 

66.73 70.21 B: exactly and a a million dollars can help 

70.67 72.20 B: with that [laughter] 

71.86 78.35 A: exactly i mean if it were me i would want them to go take it and you find another one you know 

79.16 80.70 B: well ah mm 

79.79 81.68 A: you make another friend [laughter] 

80.91 83.70 B: exactly exactly 

83.28 87.20 A: but i think you're right if i couldn't tell them i wouldn't just turn my back 

87.51 89.63 A: and walk away and take the million 

90.05 91.62 A: i would have to tell them 

92.43 97.81 B: see that's what i'm saying if you can tell them what the um the situation is 

98.21 102.16 B: more than likely like you said if they're really a best friend 

102.42 104.27 B: they would understand 

105.24 107.44 A: and they would want the best for you right 

107.54 109.35 B: i would think so [noise] 

108.75 116.65 A: otherwise if they didn't understand and they were going to be funny about it then they probably weren't a best friend that wanted your best interests in the beginning 

113.43 114.79 B: one to begin with 

117.32 118.57 B: (( well that's true )) 

119.24 123.64 B: that is really really true but that is a really really 

124.08 125.66 B: hard thing 

125.56 126.52 A: (( i thought they were )) 

126.92 128.62 A: sleep with them or something 

128.39 129.64 B: i'm sorry 

129.07 132.55 A: i thought they were going to have to say you would have to sleep with them or something 

132.27 134.20 B: oh no [laughter] 

133.51 135.12 A: [laughter] 

134.97 138.29 B: oh gosh where are you where are you from 

137.76 140.99 A: illinois can you hold on one second thanks 

139.24 140.82 B: sure sure 

145.73 148.07 A: they hung up on me anyway [laughter] 

147.51 149.08 B: oh i'm okay 

148.30 150.34 A: i'm from illinois how about you 

150.01 151.09 B: brooklyn 

150.96 152.69 A: oh wow 

152.72 155.44 A: i was trying to decide where that accent is from 

155.82 159.48 A: this is kind of a neat thing you get to talk to people from all over 

159.25 163.93 B: yes i talked to people from vermont and pennsylvania 

163.80 165.40 A: you've done it already 

165.14 167.03 B: this is my third time 

166.57 168.48 A: oh this is my first time 

168.82 170.10 B: oh 

169.90 172.45 A: oh and you always have a different topic 

172.13 173.24 B: yes 

173.35 178.19 A: oh that's neat i thought they mostly wanted men but i guess women are good too 

178.07 182.65 B: i don't understand why they would just want men they need the women's viewpoint anyway 

183.09 190.06 A: yeah i don't know maybe it's a study that they're doing i would think men would say oh hell i'll take the million no matter what 

190.35 192.72 B: i think so i think so too 

192.49 195.00 A: [mn] but we're the sentimental creatures you know 

195.23 199.95 B: you know i really don't think as many things would be accomplished if it wasn't for women 

199.74 201.99 A: oh i agree i agree 

201.53 204.39 B: because they're more like the peacemakers 

204.45 206.65 B: and mean just like to um 

207.20 208.71 B: one up each other 

207.33 210.04 A: just sit and play with the remote [laughter] 

209.29 212.45 B: (( [laughter] that too that )) 

211.47 217.01 A: sit on the couch and play with the remote honey it's time to move give me that thing [laughter] 

213.30 214.56 B: that too 

216.42 220.62 B: that too and god forbid if they can't find it 

219.93 220.97 A: i know 

221.02 223.22 A: i know but they lose it all the time 

223.01 227.03 B: you know the i think they should put it on a chain and wear it around their neck 

226.70 228.26 A: that's a good idea 

228.11 230.79 B: you know at least they'll know where it's at 

230.51 233.31 A: the couch eats it or something like that 

232.84 234.44 B: always always 

234.12 240.44 A: and they get so mad where's my remote i can't help but laugh at him you know i just [laughter] 

239.66 246.86 B: you know the funniest part about that too is they're the people that usually have it in their hands and they want you to find it 

246.15 248.23 A: oh it's our fault all the time 

247.87 250.49 B: where is it like you're supposed to know 

250.27 255.36 A: [mn] [laughter] i do know usually the couch eats it or something or they're sitting on it you know 

255.28 256.80 B: oh my gosh 

256.42 257.54 A: funny 

256.96 258.75 B: they're so helpless 

258.63 261.54 A: that's a good question though the million dollar thing 

261.44 265.58 B: it's unbelievable i don't i don't know i have a best friend 

264.98 266.04 A: uh-huh 

266.67 267.86 B: and 

268.13 270.42 B: i could use a million dollars but 

271.24 277.77 A: well i guess if you're talking about a girlfriend but i i guess and my husband is my best friend i have to say 

278.02 281.42 A: so if it was him i'd probably turn it down and stay with him 

281.81 282.78 A: you know 

283.23 283.79 B: (( mm )) 

283.49 285.35 A: remote problems and all 

285.15 286.58 B: [laughter] 

285.37 292.57 A: [laughter] he's my best friend i would have to say no you know you keep it we'll do something not around you know we'll make it 

292.00 295.52 B: oh that's a nice thing that's a nice thing which you just said 

295.22 297.33 A: (( yeah well it's the truth )) 

296.93 299.86 B: that is really oh yeah you're lucky too 

299.53 304.43 A: because it's hard to find true love in a guy and as crazy as they are you know 

304.59 307.49 A: but a girlfriend she would have to understand you know 

308.33 313.45 B: oh i that's my best friend is a female and i don't know 

313.88 315.22 B: i don't know if 

316.00 317.38 B: mm i don't know 

317.80 319.68 B: i think i would keep them 

320.26 322.65 A: you would keep the female and forget the million mm 

322.29 323.58 B: yeah 

324.38 325.92 B: i really think so 

327.06 328.43 B: (( and i i kno- )) 

327.73 330.73 A: a good best friend is worth a million dollars 

330.12 332.78 B: and i know it might seem stupid but 

332.53 335.37 A: no no it doesn't it's hard to find someone 

333.52 342.54 B: the money will be spent and it's it will it will go away but that friend it's a different i think i would keep my friend 

342.72 346.26 A: but then you see you could do things with your million to help her 

346.31 348.80 A: even though you can't talk to her or anything 

346.34 347.08 B: what 

348.78 354.18 B: well i then i would have to do it anonymous because if i'm going to turn my back on them 

348.88 351.14 A: you could make her life better as well 

354.14 355.03 A: right 

354.21 357.31 B: and then i try and help them use i don't know 

357.82 360.50 B: ooh that is really a good question 

360.20 362.41 A: you can do it anonymously 

362.49 364.26 B: and that's the only way i could 

363.04 366.36 A: she would probably know in her heart that you did it but 

366.94 371.73 A: plus you know if you think about it women are so much easier to talk to 

371.95 373.09 A: than men 

373.05 374.64 B: and why is that 

374.00 383.71 A: and it prob- a- it's just our nature i don't know we're not made of testosterone i don't know [laughter] we can sit and we can talk for an hour and not even know each other 

383.72 388.40 A: whereas men that's it two minutes no no feelings no talk 

389.22 395.06 A: i worked for years on this guy to pull his feelings out of him and i'm still working on it you know [laughter] 

394.62 396.23 B: oh my goodness 

395.88 396.84 A: yeah 

397.20 399.59 B: but you must have did something right 

399.96 400.89 B: you know 

400.31 401.93 A: it's been a long time 

401.98 403.19 B: how long 

403.11 405.45 A: seventeen years we're married 

405.15 407.02 B: oh wow 

406.00 410.70 A: it'll be seventeen years this year and we dated about eleven years 

410.59 412.24 B: (( what mm )) 

411.37 414.34 A: yeah i mean he's like all i knew 

415.67 417.29 B: (( that's a long time )) 

417.08 418.23 A: yeah 

417.64 419.62 B: that is really a long time 

419.54 426.79 A: but still you wake up some mornings and i tease him i go who are you i don't want you i want my best friend where is he 

426.83 429.03 A: i can't find him anymore you know 

429.20 431.39 B: yeah that happens every now and then 

430.20 435.97 A: i don't like this guy you know then i make him crack up i walk around the house and look for him and call his name 

436.36 439.73 B: well everything can't be perfect but the fact that you can 

440.43 442.73 B: you know agree to disagree 

443.42 445.56 A: yeah well you have to we're different 

446.15 447.89 A: we're very different you know 

448.20 452.01 B: and that that saying must be true that opposites attract 

451.54 452.84 A: i guess it is 

453.10 458.78 B: you know that is really true see and that's how i my my girlfriend we're totally different 

458.84 459.44 A: (( mm )) 

459.24 460.71 B: she's um 

461.09 462.89 B: real rigid 

462.74 463.88 A: uh-huh

465.64 466.79 A: right 

466.18 468.45 B: she's exactly the opposite 

468.28 469.68 A: oh

470.52 473.05 B: see what i don't have

479.93 484.02 B: there's times that things bad things happen to her and 

484.04 488.34 B: i'll talk with her for six and seven hours on the phone falling asleep
