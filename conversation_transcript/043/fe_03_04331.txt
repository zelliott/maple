392.19 393.30 A: mhm 

392.87 401.49 B: i i've regretted that a lot over the last few years but now i now i'm at a point in my life where

404.45 413.12 B: but if i could go back to the year that i left then i wou- i wouldn't i wouldn't go i would stay and get my degree

413.42 414.27 B: but 

413.55 415.65 A: yeah mhm 

414.99 424.11 B: there are a lot of things that we do that we we don't realize until later and of course every time you look back over your life 

417.52 418.52 A: mhm 

420.40 421.13 A: (( mhm )) 

424.21 425.56 A: yeah 

424.22 431.29 B: there are always things that you wish you had done or wish you hadn't done but that's because hindsight is 

428.17 429.69 A: (( yeah hm )) 

431.48 435.23 B: is a hundred percent perfect [laughter] 

434.33 438.59 A: oh yeah a- and actually i found that i'm kind of 

439.38 441.94 A: ah too late ah every thing 

441.65 442.82 B: mhm 

442.64 447.93 A: yeah because like ah after i graduated from university ah 

447.00 447.85 B: uh-huh 

448.30 452.13 A: it took me like ah i worked for like ten years 

452.18 457.78 A: to and then i go back to school to get my master degree 

455.41 456.31 B: oh 

457.15 458.10 B: (( mhm )) 

458.08 460.36 A: (( yeah in us [laughter] )) 

461.03 466.96 A: so yeah but but then after i got my degree i seemed to be too old that's 

467.33 470.73 B: you i you you don't sound old at all 

470.31 472.72 A: all oh thank you yeah but 

471.62 476.68 B: are you is your family here from taiwan with you or are you by yourself 

476.40 478.35 A: oh i'm by myself 

477.99 481.34 B: oh my what a brave person 

478.94 480.52 A: [laughter] 

481.39 485.29 B: to come all do you get to go home to visit very often 

481.44 483.09 A: (( [laughter] thanks )) 

485.63 490.04 A: oh oh i just go back like once a year 

489.86 490.95 B: uh-huh 

490.77 494.12 A: yeah but i talk to them on the phone lots [laughter] 

493.45 494.80 B: oh sure 

494.84 495.98 B: um if 

496.33 503.05 B: if you could go back and change things would would maybe you have tried to bring your family with you 

496.40 497.38 A: (( uh-huh huh )) 

503.36 510.13 A: ah yeah i think ah if i had um come to u._s. like ten years earlier 

509.72 511.21 B: (( mhm )) 

510.46 514.10 A: and i probably have already ah become ah 

514.55 519.91 A: i have probably could have ah brought my other family here already 

519.05 520.82 B: right right 

520.45 527.40 A: yeah but now it's going to take a long longer because now it's very hard to get a green card 

526.27 528.80 B: yeah well that's true 

528.92 533.69 B: um if you had been able or if you could go back and change this thing 

528.95 530.03 A: mhm 

534.07 540.12 B: to bring your family with you would they have agreed to come or or or not 

540.90 543.06 A: (( ah probably some of them would )) 

543.07 551.03 A: some probably not like my mother probably she didn't want to live here because she didn't speak english [laughter] 

544.82 545.48 B: (( mhm mm )) 

550.38 554.46 B: oh well that would make it difficult but it must 

553.66 557.61 A: yeah but the younger people they they would like to come here 

557.07 569.60 B: yeah um i would like to be younger myself if i could go back and change things i would change the year that i was born i'd be born later so right now i would be younger [laughter] 

563.43 564.26 A: (( ah )) 

567.46 570.55 A: (( [laughter] oh geeze )) 

570.59 580.35 B: when i was twenty i thought that fif- i thought that forty was really old by the time i got to forty it didn't look so it didn't feel so old right then so 

572.89 573.72 A: uh-huh 

580.02 583.24 A: oh yeah yeah time flies [laughter] 

581.04 582.09 B: (( but i i- )) 

582.47 588.85 B: i- well and you'll find that the older the older you get the faster time seems 

588.92 592.89 B: it's kind of like when i was a when i was a child 

590.69 591.74 A: oh 

593.02 599.89 B: um it seemed when i got out of school in the summer that the summer would be forever long now that i'm ol- 

593.09 594.07 A: uh-huh 

599.01 599.89 A: uh-huh
