8.26 10.59 B: oh my goodness [laughter] 

9.63 15.39 A: [laughter] i thought oh that's a good one i like my other ones better [laughter] 

14.40 20.48 B: at first thought if you were each offered a million dollars what would you do with it i thought that's what they were going to say then they said you couldn't talk to your best friend 

18.25 22.43 A: yeah but that's going only if we don't speak to our best friend 

21.61 23.26 B: oh i i 

23.34 25.09 B: (( ah [laughter] )) 

24.68 30.20 A: do you know i now i'd go for the technicality of it i would have it looked at 

29.84 30.83 B: uh-huh 

30.54 42.25 A: and to see if it meant technically i could not talk to them because i like to write my best friend notes yes it didn't say no contact with them now it said speak to them 

37.58 38.57 B: uh-huh 

40.39 41.39 B: [laughter] 

41.66 45.01 B: speak to them that's true i mean you do email you could do 

44.19 49.31 A: uh-huh so if that's the case i'd take the million dollars and my friend and i'd have a good time 

48.83 50.75 B: [laughter] 

49.80 52.45 A: and i could manage not to talk 

52.04 53.18 B: okay 

52.84 54.65 A: because sign language 

54.37 56.56 B: that's true that's true 

55.37 58.21 A: you know a million dollars is a lot of money [laughter] 

57.30 60.34 B: i know i know if it meant no contact i 

60.99 65.21 B: oh i could use that money but i don't know if i'd want to give up my friendship either you know yeah 

64.60 71.50 A: i don't think i'd give up my friendship i don't think i could give up my friendship but like i said i'd ha- see they didn't get technical on it 

66.36 67.69 B: yeah 

70.68 74.59 B: that's true you're you're trying to pull the [laughter] strings there [laughter] 

73.60 76.70 A: yeah i they didn't say they just said speak 

76.26 77.94 B: [laughter] 

77.17 81.79 A: you know so but that'd be awful not to have your best friend to talk to 

81.14 88.24 B: i know and that would be horrible i mean i just moved so i kind of have two good friends right now but my best friend's still back home but 

86.11 87.40 A: oh 

87.50 89.73 A: so you're n- where where are you at now 

89.25 90.93 B: i now live in new york 

90.70 93.75 A: new york i talked to a guy from new york yesterday [laughter] 

93.27 94.47 B: really 

93.82 95.64 A: long island uh-huh 

94.95 96.13 B: oh wow 

95.65 97.17 A: i'm in texas 

96.88 101.44 B: texas i could kind of tell you were down south from that accent [laughter] 

97.36 98.21 A: uh-huh 

99.95 107.31 A: oh oh yeah everybody c- we visited new york ah about a month ago and everybody could tell we were from texas 

106.53 108.84 B: oh yeah it's kind of hard to to 

109.01 110.59 B: hide that fact [laughter] 

109.93 117.32 A: i thought maybe our friends meant more to us down here [laughter] c- you know the southerners talk to much 

116.59 118.17 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

117.46 119.94 A: and you talk to strangers 

119.40 120.74 B: (( yeah )) 

120.37 124.75 A: but i don't see that as much in the northern states uh-huh 

123.13 127.34 B: really well then you didn't get to know me i should have been a a southerner 

126.27 130.72 A: you should have been a southerner i was going to s- and the guy i talked to yesterday was that way 

130.23 131.38 B: really 

130.81 132.97 A: mhm is this your first call or 

132.55 134.62 B: this is actually my second call 

134.01 135.60 A: this is my third one 

135.25 137.41 B: okay all right how did you hear about this 

135.97 136.81 A: so 

137.66 141.30 A: ah i a friend told me about it on the internet yeah 

140.67 144.07 B: okay yeah i found out about it on the internet too [laughter] 

143.14 149.12 A: yeah and i thought what could she lose even though these subjects sometimes a million dollars to speak to my best friend 

147.66 151.58 B: i know and now we should probably get back to that we're supposed to talk about that 

150.43 159.24 A: yeah we're supposed to talk eight minutes well now it could be ta- here we go if i if it didn't have to be my very best friend i could take the million dollars 

151.86 153.16 B: [laughter] 

156.94 158.06 B: [laughter] 

158.79 161.10 B: yeah they did say best friend and 

160.44 164.91 A: it did say best friend so i don't think i could do it because 

163.95 168.08 B: i do- i mean as much as i'd love to have a million dollars i i 

168.19 170.61 B: i think i need my friendship more you know 

169.93 173.26 A: and the million dollars might not make us happy without our friends 

172.76 179.62 B: that's true that's true i mean yeah and then you could get lots of other friends but who knows if they're friends for you or if they're friends for your money 

173.69 174.66 A: yeah 

178.95 184.32 A: yeah if you that'd be like these strange benefactors of if you marry or something you know 

183.77 185.42 B: right yeah 

184.63 188.60 A: so i don't think i could give up my friendship for a million dollars 

186.56 190.54 B: no no and though it would be tempting [laughter] 

189.77 193.79 A: how about we make it a hundred million and we could do it 

191.63 195.47 B: (( [laughter] sorry [laughter] )) 

194.61 199.77 A: [laughter] [laughter] is your best friend still in new york now that you live there 

199.13 210.48 B: um actually no she's back in pennsylvania she used to live yeah she used to live right down the road from us and we all had children the same age and everything so it made it very easy for us to be friends with our children you 

201.25 202.92 A: oh pennsylvania 

209.32 212.48 A: oh yes so now you couldn't give up that friend for a million dollars [laughter] 

212.14 218.16 B: know exactly exactly and i've often told her she'll always be my best friend because she knows too much about me [laughter] 

217.46 225.00 A: yeah you know and some of your friends that you make i've i'm in my late fifties so i've lost a couple of my good friends already you know 

223.94 225.43 B: wow oh 

224.97 233.62 A: and so as you make new ones though and you know pick up a little bit more friendship and there you go again i couldn't have gave up any of them for a million [laughter] 

229.63 230.66 B: right 

233.71 235.64 B: (( see [laughter] )) 

234.96 236.44 A: are your kids grown 

236.22 241.30 B: ah no no mine are um eight and a half almost nine and just turned six 

241.01 242.81 A: oh my gosh you're young 

242.30 244.65 B: (( well i'm not that young [laughter] )) 

243.93 247.56 A: yeah you got a long time for that friendship [laughter] 

246.17 248.83 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

248.71 252.59 A: would your kids give up their best friends for a million dollars 

251.46 263.58 B: um i don't think so because even though we moved they still talk to them all the time on the phone and online and things like that so you know and everytime we go down to visit they have to go see them and sleep over and that kind of stuff so i don't 

262.48 263.93 A: oh do they 

263.80 267.50 B: oh yeah oh yeah they value their friendships an awful lot 

266.90 270.17 A: well my kids are thirty six and thirty nine now 

268.66 269.22 B: (( [mn] )) 

269.42 272.21 B: okay well then i could be your daughter [laughter] 

270.96 276.24 A: yeah see so i think my thirty nine year old wouldn't give up his friendship for the million 

275.78 277.06 B: mhm 

276.40 280.27 A: but i think my thirty six year old would give up his friendship 

280.04 280.95 B: yeah 

280.50 283.85 A: for a million dollars because he'd say his best friend understood 

283.49 285.61 B: yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

284.80 287.82 A: now i don't know if my best friend would understand [laughter] 

288.77 294.43 B: you know what i think my best friend would understand and maybe what you could do is give them half a million 

291.18 292.60 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

294.07 295.33 A: yeah 

294.55 295.52 B: you know 

295.53 296.35 B: and then 

295.64 301.23 A: and like i said they're i would be checking the technicalities because it plainly said not to speak 

300.52 302.84 B: not to speak that's true that's true 

302.26 305.73 A: so that just means no telephone and no voice 

305.43 310.28 B: yeah but you could learn sign language you're right you could you know just write notes back and forth 

307.87 312.74 A: uh-huh email as long as you didn't use a microphone when you email 

312.12 314.39 B: right [laughter] 

313.17 315.50 A: yeah but no long distance 

315.87 317.54 B: well it would save the phone bills 

317.55 327.50 A: yeah i bet it does though you know with that new system now where you call from any state for like sixty bucks or something your phone bill could really b- improve still i guess 

318.66 319.84 B: [laughter] 

324.17 325.20 B: yeah 

326.84 333.90 B: yeah yeah i use my cellphone mainly for talking now for long distance because i'm already paying for it yeah [laughter] 

327.97 328.93 A: so 

331.53 332.67 A: oh do you 

333.04 340.86 A: yeah oh yeah i don't have a c- the only thing i've got is a track phone you know where you pay for your minutes yeah and i just use it for emergencies so 

337.55 339.58 B: okay just the minutes yeah 

340.44 341.93 B: (( okay that's great )) 

341.13 347.53 A: i could tell my best friend she could you know look at the phone number and email me back it didn't say she couldn't speak to me 

347.12 347.87 B: that's 

347.99 352.44 B: that's true oh you are good at looking at these technicalities [laughter] 

352.51 363.61 A: i if i had my life to go back and redo as a youngster i said i'd probably like to be a lawyer not a lawyer a legal assistance you know to check into all this but see i'd look at the technicalities 

357.56 358.50 B: really 

359.16 360.21 B: okay 

362.77 366.53 B: right one of the research assistants or something like that [laughter] [laughter] 

364.81 368.20 A: uh-huh because you know really when 

368.53 377.00 A: my stepdad just died and he left his will in such a mess well it's been over a year ago but you know that's where your technicalities come in at 

370.16 371.03 B: oh 

376.30 378.12 B: (( yeah exactly yeah mhm )) 

377.23 383.44 A: and so you know they just said if a benefactor left you a million dollars to not speak to your best friend 

384.20 388.77 A: and so there you go i guess i could fight it out in court i wonder if this ever happened 

387.99 389.76 B: yeah i don't know 

389.38 394.14 A: that'd be a strange circumstance you'd have to hate somebody's best friend 

391.26 392.41 B: oh yeah 

394.46 402.78 B: [laughter] that kind of n- da- d- n- negates the whole best friend issue then though if you hate them [laughter] but oh 

399.53 406.79 A: yeah so that would be strange well one of my best friends that's passed away now was a millionaire 

406.48 408.45 B: oh really wow 

407.03 414.45 A: uh-huh so i you know i don't think she would understand um me not speaking to her for a million dollars [laughter] 

413.64 415.72 B: right well she had it all before so 

415.02 417.70 A: because she she was poor when she was young 

417.23 418.40 B: (( okay mhm )) 

417.72 423.13 A: but she married and her husband just made it well in life you know so she had those millions 

423.38 425.09 B: (( yeah you get very used to it )) 

423.71 427.23 A: so i don't have those millions so [laughter] 

425.88 429.21 B: no no me either [laughter] 

428.37 433.28 A: well i don't i don't guess i have to worry about anybody leaving me a million dollars 

430.67 435.48 B: [laughter] nope i don't even play the lottery only 

435.45 443.35 A: i don't either because the texas lottery's changed around so much i can't keep up with it yeah i'd never win a million on that anyway 

435.60 437.08 B: only on a rare occasion 

439.44 441.80 B: really oh [laughter] 

442.86 453.23 B: no no i'd be happy if i did but i don't think it would happen and i i sit there and fantasize sometimes and knowing me as thrifty as i am i don't think i'd be able to spend it all [laughter] 

452.61 456.49 A: no see i'd still be doing like coupons and all that uh-huh 

454.78 455.72 B: (( uh-huh )) 

456.22 457.28 B: oh and 

457.40 459.52 B: and such stuff [laughter] 

458.86 467.85 A: yeah i ah tell you now so see that million dollars you know i don't we're better probably leaving it in the bank so well we does your best friend coupon 

462.12 463.16 B: mhm 

464.70 465.91 B: [laughter] 

467.73 469.86 B: um i taught her how to yes 

469.43 470.91 A: (( did you )) 

470.22 471.15 B: yes 

471.16 472.41 B: yep 

471.88 474.52 A: ah my best friend does too you know so 

473.65 480.99 B: okay i i think there's something special about couponers number one it makes us very friendly [laughter] and talkative to other people [laughter] 

478.93 481.39 A: (( yeah you can talk to anybody )) 

482.12 491.73 B: and and you just you're there to give to other people or to help other people and show them different ways to do things so i i think couponers are a whole new breed of people [laughter] 

490.19 496.47 A: yeah i should have had this subject with my guy yesterday i talked to because he was fixing to get married for the first time 

495.92 497.11 B: oh 

496.63 498.96 A: and he was forty four years old 

498.43 499.63 B: (( yeah mm )) 

499.09 507.32 A: and he was well in fact he's from new york you know but he's a writer up there and so i don't know he he was fixing to get married and he was talking about the money because 

507.46 515.65 A: and i i- it was what you'd go back and do with your past if you could live life over you know and i thought yeah he could probably say what he'd do he'd give up his best friend for a million 

509.78 510.86 B: right 

511.26 512.42 B: right yeah 

515.52 519.85 B: actually you know what i just realized something my best friend is my husband 

519.99 520.97 B: and i wouldn't 

520.01 527.67 A: oh i know i wouldn't give up mine yeah i guess too if you look at it see like that you got a good subject there see see you think 

521.39 523.25 B: and i would never give him up 

524.05 525.30 B: yeah 

527.03 528.60 B: (( yeah [laughter] thank you )) 

527.84 529.75 A: see just like the coupons 

529.06 530.58 B: [laughter] 

529.86 533.04 A: yeah my best because i've been married forty years 

532.44 533.84 B: okay yeah 

533.22 535.70 A: so my best friend is my husband too 

534.96 539.88 B: yeah yeah i we've only been married twelve years this summer but still 

539.45 541.31 A: he's still your best friend 

540.57 541.89 B: (( yes he is )) 

541.62 545.21 A: and you ca- would your kids consider him their best friend too 

541.95 543.83 B: and i'm happy to say that 

545.15 546.37 B: my children 

545.85 546.78 A: uh-huh 

547.13 552.74 B: ah they're eight and six come on [laughter] [laughter] well 

548.71 550.88 A: oh yeah dad's still the mean guy 

551.75 555.69 A: see now my kids would probably consider their dad one of their best friends 

555.19 560.31 B: yeah yeah they probably would i mean they're still in the hero stage with daddy it's you know 

559.94 564.86 A: yeah but if you offered them a million dollars to go buy toys with 

560.86 561.70 B: but 

563.82 565.67 B: [laughter] they'd they'd 

565.05 568.29 A: they'd say oh daddy can go away with us [laughter] 

567.65 569.75 B: (( [laughter] uh-huh [laughter] [sigh] )) 

568.86 576.99 A: yeah that would be you know and i think a man though do you think a man would come near giving up a to a best friend for a million dollars 

577.14 580.20 B: i hate to say it but probably quicker than a woman would 

579.84 583.10 A: i think so because they're not as sentimental as we are 

580.77 581.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

581.99 588.98 B: yeah and and their friendships don't go as as deep as i think women's friendships go you know i mean 

587.97 590.33 A: no they don't i don't think they do 

589.78 598.49 B: they go and they play golf and they have fun and they do their thing but women you know they really let their emotions out and their feelings and i don't think that men do that as much 

598.22 599.95 A: no so they could probably give i m- 

598.70 599.64 B: so
