120.22 121.04 A: (( i )) 

121.24 130.00 A: i don't know man i wish time travel existed because that would be i really definitely would go back and the whole reason i got kicked out of school was 

130.21 131.16 A: um 

132.38 142.86 A: i skipped school with a bunch of people that that didn't go to my school i came back to go to the lunch period and when i came 'cause it was like turkey manhattan or something for lunch i really wanted to eat it 

142.38 143.28 B: [laughter] 

142.90 146.85 A: so i took a bunch of my older friends into school with me to eat lunch 

147.01 153.02 A: and then i got caught on the way out and i was like and they told me that i had to go back to class and i was like i'm not even here today 

153.13 164.46 A: and they said that i had to go back to class i said well i got people here that are on their lunch break from work you know and they don't have any other way back so i got to you know i got to take these people back to work and stuff and so they 

164.90 165.73 A: (( get down )) 

167.03 176.82 A: so they told me that a well they tried to expel me they told me that i could come back to school and take tests only and this was like a month before graduation 

176.49 177.34 B: wow 

176.88 183.58 A: and they told me i could come back and take tests well then the the guy that had gotten me suspended came in the office one day 

183.70 188.80 A: and i cussed him out so then they made me go to the superintendent's office and they said i could only take my final 

188.98 193.64 A: so i took my finals and i only passed three classes out of five or out of seven so 

193.77 194.63 A: (( i was a cr- )) 

194.90 199.13 A: a credit and a half short of graduating so i would definitely go back and change that 

199.11 199.77 B: (( mm )) 

200.53 205.14 A: i might have more respect for people like the athletic director the guy that got me expelled 

205.18 209.23 A: or might have more respect for the police officers that arrest me 

209.32 210.04 B: hm 

210.96 212.10 B: where are you from 

211.17 212.90 A: that would always be a good thing

231.71 233.02 B: i think uh 

233.92 240.64 B: i also definitely regret taking the past job that i had because i ended up not making any money 

240.59 251.96 B: when it came down to it and it just screwed me it game me decent experience in terms of looking at it on my resume but when it comes down to it it was actually a very negative experience 

252.12 253.07 B: um 

253.14 253.83 A: [noise] 

253.50 262.42 B: i was working for a really small entertainment company and it was a husband and wife run uh business and they i was their first full time employee ever 

262.50 263.27 B: and 

262.63 263.63 A: (( wow )) 

263.33 273.71 B: yeah so they ended up screaming over big time they told me that i was going to be making half salary half commissions and the commissions were like equaled out to about fifty dollars a week

267.92 268.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

273.83 274.65 B: so 

274.93 276.64 B: it wasn't good at all 

276.96 277.90 B: um 

278.06 281.26 A: (( [noise] nick come down here and talk to russell on the phone )) 

278.60 279.16 B: (( [mn] )) 

282.12 284.45 A: (( just tell him what i'm doing why i can't talk )) 

287.37 291.73 A: [sigh] [noise] well i don't think time travel is possible so i don't think we have to worry about it 

291.17 292.04 B: yeah 

292.33 296.68 A: do you think that's possible it can't be possible there's just there's there's no way 

295.29 297.11 B: it'd be nice [laughter] 

298.53 301.86 A: and people rationalize that however they want but it can't happen 

301.25 302.08 B: right 

304.02 304.90 B: (( yeah i )) 

305.11 313.93 B: don't know i don't think there's too much in life that i would say i regret all that much i feel like so far i've done almost everything that i would have wanted to do mm 

314.69 316.32 A: well that's pretty good 

316.98 324.58 A: see stupid things like running away and [noise] and getting pregnant and having a kid right out of high school that kind of stuff i don't regret 

324.92 328.66 A: but [sigh] like running away was a great experience for me 

329.67 334.19 A: i got to go to new york a couple of times i went to utah 

335.30 336.09 B: (( wow )) 

336.24 337.37 A: (( from what [noise] ))

348.66 350.07 A: (( i don't either )) 

353.14 356.01 B: what other what other kind of questions have you been asked on this 

356.63 357.64 A: um 

357.95 365.32 A: the other one was it was talking about minimum wage and well okay we're not supposed to talk about that yeah it was talking about minimum wage though and 

365.55 366.37 A: uh 

367.26 375.42 A: and if it was enough and we talked about the different you know the styles of living in like oregon versus indianapolis that's where he was from 

375.60 376.67 B: (( oh oh okay )) 

376.38 382.85 A: it does get easier well it it was easier this one's a hard one to talk about that one 'cause they gave you a really 

377.75 378.53 B: [laughter] 

383.10 385.86 A: a really you know limited topic 

385.38 386.39 B: right 

388.54 394.07 B: there's no such thing yeah it's an interesting program overall i've never a friend of mine from school had told me about it 

394.58 397.67 A: yeah i thought it's a really good idea [noise] 

397.77 409.11 A: like the whole minimum wage thing gives people you know a good idea about stuff you could talk i don't know what else we can talk about that other the guy that i was on this with before had done the same minimum wage topic three times 

408.84 409.82 B: oh gee 

410.75 411.52 A: so 

412.36 414.64 A: and they might call you a couple of times a day [noise] 

415.15 416.19 B: (( [laughter] oh really )) 

418.38 419.58 B: (( very interesting )) 

420.20 421.14 B: [laughter] 

421.91 425.79 B: yeah i have no idea like what else we could even talk about about it 

427.98 435.79 A: you really there's nothing in particular one thing you would go back and change maybe one person you didn't talk to that you wanted to or 

437.29 440.68 B: [laughter] i don't know i can't like think of something 

440.74 441.84 B: i think 

443.57 445.96 B: i would have to say i'd probably like 

446.07 449.83 B: go back and just not be as naive when it comes to like 

449.92 454.64 B: people i w- dated in high school and things like that like because i really [mn] 

454.77 459.22 B: found total assholes and got totally hurt by them and things like that 

458.40 461.14 A: [noise] that's the women thing we do that 

460.27 468.95 B: yeah and i mean like my ex boyfriend in college i thought he was amazing and thought he was quite possibly the one for me and then he cheated on me after a few years so 

469.29 470.22 B: um 

470.56 472.58 B: just like i wish that 

473.50 476.58 B: i guess i just wish you could see things in a 

474.62 475.33 A: (( [noise] )) 

477.18 480.80 B: you know hindsight is always twenty of twenty like i wish that we could just 

480.94 483.08 B: see what's coming to you and i 

483.54 485.35 B: don't know uh but i guess you know 

485.40 489.73 B: you wouldn't have life experiences if you didn't um 

487.23 487.80 A: (( [noise] )) 

489.98 496.01 B: you know like we'd all be married at you know two if we all knew who was going to hurt us and who wasn't you know so 

495.38 496.43 A: right 

498.20 499.62 B: [lipsmack] interesting but i i 

499.78 505.58 B: i feel like i've learned a lot from any situation i've been in so i don't know that i necessarily regret anything 

505.82 507.18 B: (( 'cept i )) 

506.58 508.23 A: [laughter] you're so lucky 

507.69 510.01 B: (( don't know [laughter] i just can't think of )) 

509.13 517.47 A: there there's not much i regret like i said the stupid little things like running away and and getting arrested most of that wasn't so bad 

519.67 521.02 B: (( um yeah i don't )) 

523.03 528.56 A: [noise] they should ask something like if there was one personality trait you could change what would it be [noise] 

528.25 529.11 B: (( know yeah )) 

529.25 530.68 B: that's a good question 

530.50 532.91 A: and not be attracted to assholes 

532.86 533.94 B: [laughter] 

533.96 536.16 A: (( i still am i haven't learned yet )) 

537.08 539.31 B: yeah that's one thing that i 

539.80 543.72 B: don't know that i've necessarily learned completely but i know exactly what i 

543.81 545.24 B: want in a guy 

546.14 547.21 B: but i 

547.37 548.36 B: uh 

548.56 551.88 B: haven't necessarily found that because i still 

552.21 554.39 B: manage to find the assholes [laughter] 

556.26 559.82 B: i don't think there are that many nice guys out there that's the problem 

560.32 563.90 A: [noise] the ones that i just happen to meet completely unattractive 

564.91 566.60 A: and that's why they are still 

566.90 568.42 A: (( because they have to be [noise] )) 

568.37 569.25 B: oh 

572.99 575.11 A: (( it has not been ten [laughter] minutes )) 

574.98 576.01 B: [laughter] 

578.17 581.62 B: [laughter] it's strange how long ten minutes can actually be [laughter] 

581.28 582.30 A: well it 

583.49 585.38 A: was a really strange topic 

585.11 586.17 B: i know [laughter] 

587.29 587.85 B: (( [mn] )) 

588.25 593.19 A: [noise] i can't imagine any market research that would have to do with people changing things 

592.88 593.74 B: (( yeah )) 

594.78 598.19 B: [laughter] they're trying to come up with a time machine apparently [laughter] 

597.91 599.89 A: [laughter] well maybe 

599.27 599.89 B: [laughter]
