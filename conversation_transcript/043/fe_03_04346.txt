0.07 1.80 A: hi this is cat 

1.99 4.72 B: (( how are you doing my name is fernando )) 

4.33 10.75 A: hey fernando [laughter] so i mean i guess that kind of depends on who you consider your best friend 

10.40 12.97 B: (( [laughter] well i don't know maybe )) 

12.81 14.22 A: maybe [laughter] 

13.51 15.36 B: (( yeah )) 

14.49 21.34 A: i mean because i mean your best friend could be someone you work with or could be like your boyfriend or girlfriend and i mean that means 

18.14 23.29 B: yeah exactly and your best friend could be your your remote control 

22.89 28.26 A: [laughter] if that was the case i think i would take the million dollars [laughter] 

26.33 28.79 B: (( [laughter] right for real )) 

28.60 33.06 A: i don't know um from an unknown benefactor that's kind of sketchy too 

32.81 36.77 B: (( yeah but i i would rather the million dollars myself )) 

36.71 37.62 A: huh 

37.32 41.66 B: (( i would rather the million dollars myself yeah any day )) 

39.21 47.29 A: yeah [laughter] yeah me too ah i well no i don't know if i would take it because a million dollars doesn't go as far as it used to 

47.13 52.70 B: no it doesn't because now a million dollars you're not getting actually million dollars [laughter] 

51.67 55.86 A: exactly because it would probably be taxed like you know more so 

53.55 58.63 B: right and it would get super taxed not just taxed it would be super duper taxed 

57.87 62.36 A: exactly so we're really talking about like a half a million dollars [laughter] 

60.13 71.67 B: yeah or should i say three quarters of a million because they got to take the taxes then you've got state federal and then i._r._s. want to come down on you asking where you get a million dollars from 

71.28 81.47 A: and that's every year because you have to do it so um it wouldn't last long so actually it'd be getting getting yourself taken care of for maybe like five years or losing your friend [laughter] 

72.47 74.28 B: every year exactly 

79.33 84.00 B: yeah i will probably say less than that the way money goes now 

83.60 85.20 A: yeah that's very true 

84.35 87.15 B: man it goes like water 

86.89 88.28 A: that's very true 

87.68 102.42 B: it gets spent like water because you you know like you have people with families and all that you've got to spend money on the kids money on mortgage money on car notes money on payment for the bills and stuff like that 

101.81 106.93 A: or if you know somebody who's sick and you want to help take care of them that'll go really fast in hospital bills 

106.56 108.41 B: (( hospital bills as well )) 

107.75 109.38 A: exactly 

108.79 114.14 B: yeah there's a lot of p- a lot of dues to be paid and nobody's paying them 

113.69 116.04 A: that's very true that's very true 

114.80 119.25 B: so really that's why that's why bloomberg are messing up now [laughter] 

118.46 120.50 A: (( bloomberg what's going on with bloomberg )) 

120.19 130.81 B: bloomberg he he he over here um [noise] doing budget cuts and and taxing on everything the the the the car fare went up to two dollars 

130.18 136.60 A: oh yeah no i wouldn't give him any of my money [laughter] [laughter] no i wouldn't do that at all [laughter] 

132.14 135.01 B: for real i'm like damn 

135.98 147.27 B: that's crazy i don't understand that all breaking breaking the the the the the the the the the lower class they he's breaking them more than what they w- they was already broke 

138.28 139.40 A: [laughter] 

146.94 148.65 A: yeah that's very true 

148.24 154.40 B: and that don't make no sense trying to take away the zoos and the k- childrens love the zoo 

153.96 155.56 A: [laughter] 

154.88 159.06 B: that don't make no sense just just for a million dollars 

156.28 157.37 A: so i don't 

158.10 166.49 A: just for a million i don't know i don't think so i probably wouldn't i mean because i guess because my best friend would be my best friend would probably be my boyfriend 

166.06 166.92 B: right 

166.47 176.62 A: and that would be well i mean i guess see that's that's what i mean it depends on who they're talking about like it could be my mom too like my mom is my best friend too so i wouldn't leave my mom for a million dollars you know 

170.90 171.75 B: right 

172.15 174.16 B: (( right right right )) 

175.71 177.32 B: oh of course not 

176.71 183.71 A: no of course not so i i would probably have to say no but i mean it guess it depends on what their definition of my best friend would be 

183.36 191.77 B: right i'm saying best friend could be anything like you said [laughter] it could be an object it could be a lucky charm 

187.44 189.17 A: (( [noise] exactly )) 

191.35 192.89 A: exactly and it would get 

191.89 194.48 B: it could be a person it could be an animal 

194.24 197.25 A: yep and it would taxed it would get taxed like 

196.39 210.33 B: yeah yeah 'cause you know if if you if you got an animal for a best friend you getting taxed automatically you you you you got to pay for the food you got to pay for the vaccinations you got to pay for the veterinarian you know what i'm saying you got to pay for everything so 

197.42 198.32 A: so 

203.11 204.71 A: [laughter] 

205.51 206.81 A: [laughter] 

208.69 209.42 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

209.70 210.58 A: (( yeah )) 

210.27 212.87 B: you're getting taxed everywhere you go you know 

211.98 213.88 A: exactly [laughter] 

213.00 220.81 B: regardless i- if you ain't got the m- i- if you don't take the million dollars and you you you chose your best friend you're still going to have to pay for something 

220.43 221.90 A: exactly 

221.30 222.66 B: regardless 

222.17 234.19 A: well yeah and like me i live with him so i'd have to pay for all the moving costs i'd have to pay for for all his probably his moving costs too because he probably wouldn't want to speak to me ever again if i took a million dollars over over him [laughter] 

226.07 227.43 B: right 

231.87 233.32 B: right 

233.82 240.54 B: for real and then this is and it's crazy now it's crazy this world is most definitely crazy 

237.83 239.26 A: (( yeah )) 

240.42 243.51 A: and what's ah what's this unbeknownst benefactor 

243.55 244.56 B: (( i don't know )) 

244.39 246.04 A: [laughter] 

244.79 249.89 B: (( i don't have the slightest idea i know i ain't bene- i i hope i benefit from this benefactor i )) 

249.24 251.88 A: [laughter] yeah probably not though 

251.74 252.95 B: (( don't know )) 

252.70 253.57 A: [laughter] 

253.10 254.12 B: shoo 

254.78 259.37 B: for real but yeah man [lipsmack] i will never take a million dollars off nobody you

259.65 260.52 B: (( know what i'm saying )) 

260.75 261.56 B: (( because )) 

263.02 267.10 B: it's like the lottery you win the lottery you're not getting all that money 

266.68 270.06 A: exactly well yeah exactly and you're 

267.44 268.74 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

269.41 279.67 B: they might give you a couple of payments of like five hundred thousand but that's all you're getting you know you're not going to get the whole one million because they're going to tax that five hundred thousand regardless 

279.02 279.96 A: yeah 

279.82 288.39 B: you know what i'm saying you see yourself with a big as check a- a- on t._v. next thing you know you're leaving home with probably three q- or or three quarters of that check 

280.67 281.45 A: (( yeah )) 

288.18 290.93 A: yeah that's true [laughter] especially 

288.42 291.94 B: you know what i'm saying and then by then when you add it all 

292.49 295.43 B: to be a million you ain't get a a million

306.71 308.35 A: no i wouldn't either uh-huh 

307.76 313.05 B: (( for real because [mn] what am i going to do that for it's hard to find friends now )) 

312.57 315.36 A: it really is especially after you reach 

313.06 316.81 B: you know what i mean especially someone to trust you know what i'm saying 

316.28 327.68 A: it is especially if you reach a certain age too because um i- you know after you i mean you can hang on to your childhood friends and the friends that you meet in college or whatever but like after like twenty four or twenty five everybody already has their set friends 

318.37 319.75 B: exactly 

323.38 324.67 B: (( right [noise] )) 

326.41 329.48 B: everybody already have their set friends you know what i mean 

327.84 331.84 A: yeah and they're not really interested in finding anybody else to hang out with or be friends with 

330.61 333.40 B: exactly exactly 

332.44 337.42 A: so you're trading one of your friends for a lifetime for a million dollars i don't i don't think that's cool at all 

335.57 345.56 B: exactly and that's that's uncalled for because nowadays well your fr- nowadays friends are being that friends are harder to find like when you were really some real real deep trouble 

337.91 339.61 A: exactly 

342.55 344.22 A: [laughter] 

345.02 346.04 A: yeah 

345.39 355.58 B: and and you need somebody to talk to or somebody to just be like yo i i need your help your friend will be there you know what i'm saying the million dollars ain't going to be there 

352.52 354.96 A: [noise] exactly exactly 

355.61 356.99 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

355.62 361.27 A: (( no no because it'll be gone [laughter] it'll be gone in a couple of years [laughter] )) 

357.52 359.50 B: (( there'll be exactly )) 

359.80 362.82 B: yeah and that ain't even and it ain't even 

362.61 377.09 B: a how long spending the the the the million dollars is going to be there it's just let's just say yeah you get a million dollars you go buy yourself a couple of m. sixteens and you get into a you get into a street war with somebody just because 

372.88 374.09 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

376.93 384.66 B: he he he looked at you wrong or he stepped on your shoe you know what i'm saying that the m. sixteen ain't guarantee your blood in your pocket 

384.38 385.87 A: that's very true 

385.08 399.97 B: you know what i mean because what what what what what if it jams you know if it jams then you're assed out but if it don't jam and you got a friend and and you call your friend your friend is coming through with the baseball and you know what i'm saying then we can handle some business 

385.88 388.05 A: you got to carry that for the rest of your life 

389.21 390.27 A: yeah 

390.31 392.58 A: [laughter] 

399.43 405.71 A: exactly and what if that's the friend that you traded for the million dollars then you're dead anyway so it doesn't matter [laughter] 

401.89 403.14 B: exactly 

403.19 406.31 B: it's retarded a- that that don't make no sense 

405.76 407.70 A: not at all not at all 

406.76 408.42 B: none whatsoever 

408.17 410.66 A: so what would you trade for a million dollars 

410.21 413.66 B: what would i would trade for a million dollars 

412.12 414.21 A: yes [laughter] 

413.84 416.80 B: um i would trade my 

417.34 420.87 B: i don't know i don't think i want to i wa- i wouldn't trade nothing 

418.37 422.59 A: [laughter] i don't think so either i don't think that that's e- 

421.79 427.98 B: because um i i'm saying i- i'm all right you know i'm pretty good you know what i'm saying i got my 

425.30 426.89 A: [noise] yeah exactly

449.87 451.19 A: (( yeah )) 

450.54 455.82 B: and when i'm good you know i just wa- i just i i would trade my apartment 

451.90 453.29 A: exactly 

455.86 459.69 B: (( for a million dollars because i could go get me a new one [laughter] )) 

458.00 467.92 A: yeah because if somebody came if somebody came over and offered you a million dollars for you to move out of your apartment then you'd take it exactly me too exactly or my car [laughter] [laughter] 

462.03 474.95 B: then i'll take it exactly for real because oh my god yeah like if you have a beat beat up car you know what i'm saying i'll trade i'll trade my beat up car for a thousand or mill- yeah
