0.40 1.69 B: hi 

1.70 2.64 B: hello 

2.10 3.21 A: hi 

2.78 5.20 B: hi my name is simone 

5.07 6.80 A: hi simone i'm brett ah 

6.25 7.47 B: hi brett 

7.66 9.90 B: so would you take the million dollars 

10.13 12.25 A: i believe so 

11.63 14.95 B: [sigh] [laughter] i was thinking the same thing [laughter] 

14.99 21.19 A: well the um i'd i have a lot of friends it'd be hard to pinpoint which one would be my best friend 

20.25 22.98 B: best i know that's what i was thinking 

23.29 26.81 B: um yeah i don't really have a best friend so 

27.08 33.84 B: could you tell them someone that you didn't really like [laughter] how would they know who your best friend was 

29.97 31.62 A: [laughter] 

32.99 35.21 A: yeah a former best friend [lipsmack] 

34.45 36.75 B: well i was also thinking of all the 

36.77 39.78 B: positive things that i could do with a million dollars [lipsmack] 

40.29 41.18 B: um 

41.43 47.53 B: not only i mean for myself of course but also um perhaps for my community 

47.60 52.32 B: and that perhaps um giving up a friendship might be worth it 

52.58 54.74 B: change that i could make i don't know 

54.80 57.13 A: well or maybe you could buy them a gift 

56.64 60.70 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] a parting gift [laughter] 

58.14 62.61 A: i'm saying [laughter] yeah this is a farewell gift [lipsmack] 

62.47 65.74 B: so what were you thinking that you would do with your million dollars 

65.35 68.03 A: well i'd um 

66.75 68.18 B: [noise] 

68.45 70.18 A: [lipsmack] i'd start a business 

69.92 71.29 B: wow okay 

71.07 76.20 A: i i would start a different business i should say one that's more capital intensive than 

76.24 78.83 A: the business i have now wi- with my consulting 

79.05 80.28 A: so um 

81.24 87.06 A: 'cause i have some some software that i would like to develop and and ah 

87.83 92.91 A: you know it's a lot easier to do that if you have some cash and you don't have to go out and get venture funding 

92.75 98.56 B: right so you would start a business that would generate income for this other business is what you're saying 

98.35 100.72 A: [lipsmack] well i would change businesses 

100.02 101.15 B: oh change 

100.83 106.50 A: i would um i would get out of the consulting business and get more into the software business 

105.54 106.41 B: okay 

107.68 108.90 B: interesting 

108.95 110.73 A: what would you do [laughter] 

109.94 114.17 B: [lipsmack] what would i do i would pay of all my student loans [laughter] 

114.58 121.41 B: that'll be the first thing um which would still leave me with close to a million dollars but um 

120.25 122.21 A: [laughter] 

121.55 127.93 B: leave me with about nine hundred thou- nine hundred and seventy thousand um 

126.70 129.73 A: well that's ah quite an education you've gotten 

129.17 132.82 B: yeah well thirty thousand i i guess for 

133.07 136.90 B: all of my undergraduate and graduate work isn't that bad i did it all in 

137.02 140.08 B: state universities so public universities 

139.92 141.71 A: e- eighty thousand did you say 

142.22 143.57 B: thirty thousand 

142.42 144.23 A: thir- thirty thousand i'm sorry 

144.04 152.15 B: yeah [lipsmack] um so i would still have you know nine hundred and seventy thousand i could probably earn it back with interest um 

144.33 145.47 A: (( guess that would [noise] )) 

152.67 155.04 B: what else would i do well i'm 

155.11 166.55 B: i um do a lot of work in africa so i would [sigh] probably try to build some partnerships with um businesses and communities in africa um 

167.24 174.16 B: [lipsmack] to kind of build education and and just general opportunities for people in africa 

174.03 175.13 A: (( hm )) 

175.12 177.06 B: that's probably what i would do with it 

176.39 178.29 A: that's admirable 

178.56 180.26 A: so are you very um 

180.71 188.00 A: um i guess you donate your time and you're very um beneficial to 

186.21 187.25 B: (( mm )) 

187.65 190.56 B: i don't know i don't donate a lot of time um 

190.96 192.32 B: i do 

192.36 194.92 B: i think that um 

195.24 197.48 B: i guess in the profession that i'm in 

197.55 199.56 B: it's sort of built in um 

200.64 201.59 B: (( i'm )) 

201.63 204.65 B: i'm an academic and so 

205.23 210.02 B: hopefully some of the scholarship that i do contributes back to the communities 

210.41 225.33 B: but [sigh] no i don't i wouldn't say that i i volunteer a lot i do get involv- i try to get involved in some community programs but i wouldn't say that they're volunteer intensive it's not necessarily a lot of time and it's usually things that i'm 

225.28 228.28 B: it's not like going to old peoples homes or [laughter] 

228.30 233.75 B: tutoring kids but it is some kind of community involvement um 

232.48 234.67 A: (( different groups [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm i see [noise] [noise] )) 

235.21 238.22 B: for example i participated in a 

238.58 252.55 B: conference today that was on um building ties between universities and communities and trying to foster leadership so i mean that was like a half day conference which i would consider sort of you know volunteerism 

252.66 256.16 B: but not really volunteerism if that i mean it's 

256.78 258.45 B: part of my job but 

258.61 261.20 B: it's also helping a community 

261.86 270.81 B: so i would probably i mean even though i'm saying that i would use some of the money towards africa [lipsmack] i probably would be rather selfish with it [laughter] 

270.04 275.61 A: mhm [noise] [laughter] well i i think most people would be ah 

276.04 280.25 A: but it would be nice and and i think when you look at some of the things that ah 

280.96 283.12 A: [lipsmack] people that have become 

283.52 287.21 A: wealthy in a short period of time that what they say is that 

287.46 295.91 A: the ah being a benefactor to something has always been you know one of the most enjoyable aspects of having money 

295.35 297.30 B: right yeah 

298.29 299.43 B: i um 

300.46 311.67 B: [lipsmack] so after i paid of all my student loans [laughter] and then bought a house [laughter] would be my second thing i would definitely want to do something that um again when i say 

304.55 305.11 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

311.64 323.75 B: sort of contributing back to community and specifically africa since that's kind of where i've i i feel like i'm making money off of africa as an academic that i would want to give something back but i wouldn't 

323.78 331.75 B: i don't really believe in volunteerism and and charity i believe in sort of building programs that are sustainable 

331.80 343.30 B: um so certainly kind of as you're saying building something that can generate it's own capital not necessarily for my personal benefit but for a larger community benefit 

340.54 341.51 A: mhm 

343.34 344.52 A: (( [noise] right )) 

343.50 346.76 B: and perhaps i would earn money out of it too i don't know [lipsmack] 

346.55 353.32 A: well that's always the nice way to set it set it up the um what what is your tie to africa 

353.42 356.97 B: um i do research about africa 

356.20 358.02 A: mhm 

357.83 359.02 B: is that what you mean 

358.73 359.68 A: yes 

359.30 360.11 B: yeah 

359.86 360.73 A: so 

360.41 368.02 B: i do research on africa about africa with africa and um try to publish my work so 

368.08 373.91 A: [lipsmack] and the and the results would be for educational purposes or for 

372.61 373.59 B: yeah 

373.97 376.20 A: economic benefit for africa 

374.90 385.92 B: no really for educational purposes or prob- i mean to a certain extent for educational purposes most of the stuff that academics write are for other academics 

385.32 386.68 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

386.09 392.80 B: um and very rarely do undergraduates ever read this material so 

390.33 391.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

392.09 393.17 A: right 

393.51 394.49 B: um 

394.89 400.82 B: yeah i don't know whose benefit it's really for but [laughter] it it's for my own benefit so that i can get tenure 

397.71 398.91 A: (( [laughter] )) 

400.88 403.12 A: [noise] i see so you're a professor 

402.83 403.85 B: yeah 

403.73 404.74 A: um 

405.28 407.65 A: interesting in the philadelphia area 

407.08 410.01 B: ah no but in pennsylvania 

409.54 410.65 A: oh i see 

411.50 419.43 A: um [lipsmack] yeah one of the things about africa that i i've i was able to go to africa on a business trip in um 

419.62 420.26 A: (( [noise] )) 

420.46 423.88 A: was it nineteen ninety six i think and i was in 

422.65 424.98 B: pennsylvania okay where was that 

424.68 428.97 A: it was in ah [lipsmack] johannesburg and capetown and 

428.11 428.97 B: (( okay okay )) 

429.04 432.52 A: i'd love to go back to capetown that's a great place 

431.69 435.76 B: yeah it's like san francisco which is where i'm originally from 

435.36 437.92 A: oh well i think um 

437.94 441.98 A: you know it's unfortunate that that economic conditions are still 

442.21 446.74 A: pretty tough there in in south africa and unemployment is still pretty high 

446.33 447.32 B: yeah 

447.20 461.44 A: but um [lipsmack] but it seems like well i don't know has the ah has the tide of people leaving south africa stopped you know the people that seem to be educated and [lipsmack] able to work elsewhere 

461.59 469.05 B: [lipsmack] mm well do you mean in terms of africa the african population or the european population 

468.95 476.75 A: well i i you know the people that i was recruiting at the time were actually south african natives 

469.28 470.62 B: or both uh-huh 

476.79 482.55 A: but they were you know english speaking and and most of them were white 

482.96 492.66 B: so the do you mean in terms of the the that white population leaving when i say european i meant of european descent um those people leaving or 

489.05 490.06 A: yes 

492.13 493.74 A: (( mhm yes )) 

493.17 494.28 B: um 

494.65 498.13 B: i don't know it depends i think that 

498.85 505.00 B: i don't think that you have well i don't think that historically it's had a lot of people leaving i think that for the most part 

505.45 518.25 B: there were people who left um i didn't i didn't really realise that so many people are leaving in the business field i i knew that there were a lot of academics like in the social sciences who left but who we're critical of the government and that's 

518.35 521.35 B: kind of they were forced to leave [lipsmack] 

520.47 522.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

521.65 522.64 B: um 

523.18 530.83 B: but i don't know there's a lot of you do have a lot of south africans actually in other parts of africa these days 

529.70 530.59 A: [noise] right 

530.84 534.84 B: um doing a lot of business and um 

535.72 549.21 B: perhaps because they can't get away with some of the things that were able to get away with in south africa um earlier those you know with the new government they can't do that anymore so now they've gone to countries that are sort of desperate for 

549.26 551.09 B: um income and 

551.38 558.91 B: which it actually doesn't earn them any more income because they get these really great deals where they don't pay taxes and what not and so the 

558.78 570.63 B: the governments who allow them in thinking that you know they'll be some sort of secondary income generation it doesn't really work that way 'cause all the income ends up outside of those countries 

570.33 571.71 A: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] mhm )) 

570.87 575.79 B: um so i think that people for the most part are probably staying in africa 

576.42 578.36 B: but um 

578.58 581.24 B: certainly i'm sure that there're still some 

581.35 589.55 B: population movement like into the united states and into europe but i think that a lot of people are starting to stay [lipsmack] um 

589.76 596.84 B: perhaps like in the ninety six period people weren't really sure what was gonna happen 'cause it was so close to the new election 

597.06 599.52 B: um that people were probably nervous 

599.26 599.89 A: right
