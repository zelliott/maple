0.13 1.30 A: hello 

1.20 2.52 B: hello 

2.16 3.41 A: hi how are you 

4.02 5.85 B: all right so 

6.08 7.84 B: my name is art 

7.64 10.85 A: art okay my name is aaron 

8.61 9.65 B: yes 

11.63 12.82 A: nice to meet you 

12.82 14.91 B: oh glad to meet you too 

14.52 19.93 A: [laughter] um this is a pretty easy one for me i don't think i would take it 

20.81 27.84 B: well i if i understood it correctly if best friend doesn't include my wife i think i 

28.24 29.22 B: (( ah )) 

30.06 32.12 B: could take it because my 

32.58 36.04 B: best friend is no longer alive 

35.63 37.60 A: oh wow 

36.67 40.48 B: and i think i could make use of 

40.75 46.30 B: of [laughter] such ah imaginary funds in a in a positive way that would bring 

46.93 47.76 B: (( ah )) 

47.93 51.21 B: i would hope ah make it worth while 

50.62 56.68 A: right wow that's a that's interesting i didn't think about that that possibility um 

56.87 65.56 A: [mn] i'm only twenty one so i don't think i'd want to give up my best friend right now for even for a million dollars although i'm pretty broke [laughter] 

64.58 68.39 B: [laughter] well i really respect that 'cause i'm 

68.74 75.90 B: forty years ahead of you so we have probably a little different perspective in in lots of different ways 

73.62 80.96 A: right right right although it's very tempting because i do worry about money a lot [laughter] [laughter] and i'm not owed 

78.69 79.42 B: [laughter] 

80.01 85.14 B: well i don't know i guess we're not rich by 

85.40 92.94 B: any means but we feel very blessed at our point in life and so i've been to 

93.57 97.09 B: albania a number of times to 

97.19 98.44 B: to teach 

98.73 103.05 B: ah course parallel courses of english and the bible and i've 

103.38 117.22 B: come to feel like this is extremely worthwhile and ah if i had that amount of money i think i would ah live there permanently and do that kind of work and 

117.10 118.78 A: wow yeah 

117.63 119.96 B: and so our [laughter] our 

118.98 131.61 A: that's sounds yeah that sounds really interesting yeah and now that you're you're enticing me to think of all the things i've always wanted i have travelled before but i've wanted to i was going to study abroad this semester actually in in africa and i never 

123.99 125.28 B: [laughter] 

131.58 144.91 A: and i decided not to but [mn] i've always wanted to travel and i still do and that [laughter] that'd really facilitate that pretty well so you're making it seem more more um enticing to me [mn] 

144.50 148.19 B: oh that well that's very interesting my second choice 

148.38 150.73 B: for the same purpose would be 

150.86 161.50 B: ethiopia because i have a lot of correspondence students there and oh if if we had the money to pay for it my wife would be able to go with me and 

160.88 162.18 A: right 

162.43 163.58 B: and so 

164.51 165.36 B: um 

166.18 170.57 B: i think i can honestly say it's not just for the money type of thing which 

170.01 171.97 A: no no no of course not 

170.95 172.01 B: [laughter] 

172.98 178.76 A: it's yeah it's i guess it's like a means to you know a dream that you might have or [mn] and ah 

178.83 181.81 A: that ah definitely makes sense it's a sensible 

181.53 189.25 B: well so if you were having second thoughts and were to use that money in that way wh- where would you go in africa that sounds real interesting 

188.99 190.18 A: um 

190.35 200.83 A: i was well i i was planning on studying in ghana um [mn] just to get that's one of the few ah the few places that offered and um 

195.91 196.87 B: (( oh )) 

201.73 216.61 A: but if i had if i could just travel i i d- i don't really know [mn] i really um i guess i'm pretty ignorant about africa i mean i've heard a lot about a lot of different places i'd like to go to south africa but then i'd pretty much like to go all over i would say [laughter] 

216.71 219.36 A: and with a million dollars i could probably do that 

219.40 220.72 B: yeah that's 

220.69 225.56 A: [mn] but there's i mean i want to go to all like to all countries to 

221.37 222.47 B: well that's a 

225.71 227.53 A: um you know [mn] 

227.55 231.78 A: but i i just ah to me there's just something i do know some people who have 

232.12 233.09 A: like 

233.17 244.32 A: so much money and to me part of you know although i'm always broke that's part of like you know what makes me get up in the morning and you know want to do something because i don't have so much money 

244.40 246.43 A: um so it's kind of like 

247.29 249.98 A: it it's it's still a very difficult thing 

251.70 252.72 B: (( ah )) 

252.89 255.05 B: i i can relate with that it's 

254.84 268.70 B: it seemed like it was a lot of us a good major- well not maybe a majority but a good percentage of foreign students in the local universities here at least are um are from ghana 

268.12 269.36 A: oh really 

270.49 271.39 A: wow 

271.03 276.06 B: uh-huh even when i was going to college ah i knew several students from 

276.90 278.67 B: that were from ghana so 

279.73 283.69 B: but that's ah that's very interesting for me the 

283.61 286.78 A: yeah i ha- so you ah you've been to ethiopia 

287.06 296.67 B: well i've never i've never been there but i'm i'm part of world i work with world english institute and and so i've 

296.84 297.81 B: (( ah )) 

298.42 305.35 B: i was i'm probably i have probably corresponded with oh three hundred three hundred and fifty 

305.91 314.88 B: students just from ethiopia but they're they're not all active now of course they've completed the courses but ah 

307.84 309.32 A: [mn] okay 

315.57 316.88 B: during the 

317.27 322.81 B: usually have two to three years the correspondence goes on and ah 

323.07 331.79 B: and you and kind of a a bond often times forms and so many of them i would like to meet so very much and 

331.60 332.49 A: wow 

333.52 336.15 A: ah y- you teach where do you teach 

336.55 338.79 B: well the ah 

339.36 346.14 B: the the teaching with world english institute is was originally designed to be by correspondence 

346.08 346.96 A: mhm 

346.27 354.92 B: so i you you do that from home but there's there is in both ethiopia and the european country of albania there is 

355.09 361.38 B: such a a desire and demand that we found it was worthwhile to to go there in person 

361.47 362.43 A: wow 

363.39 366.89 B: and so that was a tremendously rewarding 

368.02 369.29 B: (( trip yes )) 

368.03 371.03 A: yeah it must have been wow that's that's 

372.04 372.99 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

373.11 380.19 A: wow i'm thinking of all the things see it's just like there's so many things i'd like to sort of explore um 

380.67 394.41 A: but then on the other hand like right now all the things i think that i would want to spend money on like rock concerts and stuff i'd want to go with my friends and you know if they didn't have the money to go to everything you know i don't know so 

394.48 396.07 A: [laughter] i'd 

395.27 402.39 B: well with [laughter] with that amount of money i c- you know i've i think one one could help somebody else to go 

400.00 404.18 A: yeah i could take it it could all be on me right [laughter] 

403.30 407.95 B: [laughter] like except for the best friend i guess if one of the conditions 

407.09 410.15 A: right right right yeah it'd be kind of awkward [laughter] 

410.08 412.40 B: [laughter] 

411.00 417.42 A: very practically it'd be weird like i can't talk to you i can go to a concert with you but i can't talk to you [laughter] 

417.53 419.04 B: [laughter] 

418.26 424.36 A: but i guess i wouldn't i don't know i mean i gu- i guess i'm thinking way too realistically about it 

425.74 426.86 B: (( oh well that's )) 

429.29 431.01 A: what what was that 

431.65 432.97 B: (( well i guess )) 

433.53 436.69 B: starting to express again kind of i think 

437.36 439.22 B: the question like that of course 

439.38 440.50 B: friendship 

440.81 445.27 B: is a very valued commodity i think especially today 

445.29 447.06 A: right 

447.48 453.84 B: and ah i think my my principle well money isn't 

453.97 455.80 B: everything but 

457.16 458.27 B: (( and ah )) 

458.34 461.90 B: and i think if my best friend were alive he would ah 

461.97 466.49 B: he would understand the situation i don't think it would be a problem anyhow with 

466.63 467.48 A: (( mm )) 

466.70 468.12 B: [laughter] 

469.28 483.60 A: ah that's interesting [mn] it's interesting [laughter] like just in this like ten minute conversation all the things that we've thought of and like how it's like one i i'm not convinced i still would not give up my friend but it but um 

484.65 489.85 A: i thought you know most people would agree with me but i guess there are circumstances where 

489.97 493.14 A: [mn] it's just not you know 

493.27 495.22 A: there are other things in the 

495.09 502.49 B: well i would hope that i and i believe that i i do in in the basic principles that you are 

503.34 505.19 B: dealing with that's ah a 

507.50 509.33 B: a close friendship 

509.45 510.92 B: ah how do you put 

511.23 514.73 B: how do you put value on on that and 

514.12 515.85 A: right 

515.98 520.52 A: right yeah and i don't even know who my best friend is i'm thinking of two 

516.88 517.85 B: i don't know 

521.15 523.66 A: two guys if i w- [laughter] 

521.97 522.70 B: uh-huh 

523.76 525.18 A: quite honestly 

525.75 533.55 A: and ah one of my female best friends just said she doesn't want to talk to me ever again either so so that would be easy for me i guess 

532.52 535.70 B: oh do you mean she's already said that or [laughter] 

534.83 539.58 A: yeah so i guess i don't know if i could get by with that technicality or what 

540.23 542.80 B: well i wonder if she won a million dollars if 

545.93 547.04 B: [laughter] 

548.00 549.30 B: well i don't know 

549.38 552.72 B: just how much we're supposed to analyze that particular 

552.42 554.22 A: (( yeah i know )) 

553.94 556.45 B: presented situation but 

556.87 558.44 B: ah how you 

558.83 562.95 B: how would you disown a best friend anyway i guess or 

563.08 564.71 A: right 

563.79 568.55 B: just tell them you're no longer going good terms or something that's [laughter] 

566.38 567.36 A: [mn] 

567.75 575.75 A: yeah she well she's told me that several times so maybe maybe she ah she's been taking this survey too she's been thinking about the million dollars [laughter] 

574.88 576.81 B: [laughter] 

577.81 581.99 B: well i don't think that kind of situation is 

583.17 585.49 B: too apt to happen but 

584.89 586.68 A: (( right [laughter] right right )) 

589.35 592.94 B: and then i of course you make me have to consider well if 

593.79 596.07 B: i i have many very 

596.43 598.34 B: very good friends
