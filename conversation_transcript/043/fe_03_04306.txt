36.45 38.34 A: oh wow that must have been rough 

38.10 41.20 B: yeah it would have made a difference i i'm sure 

41.70 45.75 B: it would have made a difference in in lots of things in life 

45.54 46.92 A: (( right right mhm how )) 

46.23 50.79 B: i guess if i had the opportunity to do everything over again that's one thing that i would change

69.98 70.67 A: mhm 

72.87 83.76 B: i don't know where i live who i'm with but i don't know on the other hand you look at the life that you have now and you go well i'm kinda glad things are the way they are so 

74.06 74.92 A: mhm 

75.94 76.79 A: mhm 

83.75 85.06 A: right right 

84.43 86.02 B: kind of a catch twenty two 

86.38 89.22 A: yeah that's difficult that's difficult 

88.70 90.32 B: yeah 

90.03 92.09 A: everything happens for a reason i guess 

91.71 94.09 B: right that that's i'm assuming so 

92.59 97.27 A: mm yeah things always end up working out even with the bad 

95.99 96.89 B: right 

97.38 99.59 B: right 

98.52 101.91 A: difficult things oh ah end up making us stronger a lot of the time 

101.84 104.66 B: exactly that which doesn't kill me makes me stronger 

105.09 106.08 A: excuse me 

105.72 108.26 B: that which doesn't kill me makes me stronger 

107.91 109.83 A: exactly exactly 

112.75 114.50 A: (( um what )) 

113.52 114.68 B: and ah 

114.70 116.98 B: i guess what what would you change 

116.91 126.01 A: would i change i'm only like twenty four right now so i don't know um let me do some thinking um i guess one thing i would change is 

121.32 125.65 B: (( yeah )) 

126.73 128.71 A: (( um )) 

129.30 137.87 A: one thing i would change is my choice of school i guess um i chose to go to a city university 

134.19 135.19 B: right 

137.47 138.48 B: uh-huh 

137.92 151.26 A: um i probably should have gone to a more prestigious school it might have opened up more doors for me um given me more opportunities to actually do what i want to do with my career um 'cause right now i'm pretty much at a standstill in my career 

142.94 144.29 B: right 

147.63 149.46 B: right 

151.02 152.95 B: right 

151.27 154.55 A: um i work as fi- a finance firm 

154.37 155.31 B: uh-huh 

154.69 158.98 A: um in the back office like a supporting role but i feel that if i had gone to a 

159.14 167.20 A: more prestigious school i could be part of the front office part of the revenue generating part of the business and probably thrive more there 

164.64 165.84 B: right 

167.33 168.52 B: maybe 

168.95 171.37 B: um you probably still can 

171.45 174.33 B: ah just maybe would have gotten there faster 

171.67 172.80 A: yeah 

174.01 186.53 A: yeah probably would have gotten there faster if i'd gone to a better school um if i it if i do get into the front office of the finance firm it would probably be more of a roundabout way probably will take a lot more time 

176.82 178.17 B: right 

186.21 187.56 B: right 

186.93 189.31 A: yeah it might require further education 

189.24 190.70 B: right 

190.05 191.43 A: yeah yeah 

191.10 197.65 B: something that you wouldn't have got at a at at the s- something that you didn't receive at the smaller school maybe held you back 

197.55 200.82 A: right right or just the name of the school matters a lot 

200.57 202.59 B: right i i i guess so 

201.09 201.86 A: to 

202.52 204.23 A: yeah yeah 

204.79 205.74 B: (( huh )) 

206.00 212.28 A: but that um that pales into comparison with um your situation [laughter] with your 

209.47 211.32 B: [laughter] 

212.38 216.48 A: your the thing you'd like to change [laughter] um 

213.93 215.36 B: (( [laughter] )) 

215.45 216.36 B: [laughter] 

216.78 218.42 A: but some things can't be changed 

218.45 220.62 B: oh yeah everything happens for a reason 

219.18 220.18 A: (( um )) 

220.43 225.92 A: yeah yeah i mean it just ah matters how we deal with these obstacles in our lives i guess 

225.33 228.86 B: yeah everything shapes us one direction or another 

228.97 232.12 A: yeah exactly exactly um 

232.43 234.23 A: (( yeah it must have been really difficult )) 

235.49 238.71 A: um probably difficult for your family as well as yourself

356.66 357.52 A: right 

359.86 361.25 A: right right 

362.38 366.61 B: if you were sheltered and given everything you wanted then you wouldn't be a very strong person would you

385.44 386.60 B: oh i'm sure 

386.47 392.38 A: yeah it's natural part of the life process but it's the most difficult yeah mhm right right oh man wow 

391.25 399.27 B: i have a ah my wife probably thinks that i have a real black and white view of death now 

398.30 407.73 A: (( um )) 

399.40 410.42 B: it's just that i've i know a lot about it [laughter] i've had lots of aunt and uncles ah died plus both my parents so it's ah it's a really cut and dried deal for me it's 

410.45 415.29 B: it's something that i know happens a lot of people they think that they know that it happens but they 

415.96 418.40 B: they really don't [laughter] till it's here [laughter] 

424.73 425.51 B: (( uh-huh )) 

434.37 436.10 A: how did you end up overcoming it 

436.16 437.46 A: (( does it still haunt you )) 

437.61 442.86 B: ah no it's ah it's acceptance i mean there's nothing you can do about it it's 

444.43 451.78 B: ah [sigh] you can either [sigh] rise up and accept it and move on with your life or you can [sigh] 

451.56 462.38 B: ah be one of them people who made oprah winfrey rich [laughter] you know be on there be thirty thirty five years old and and still living in the past and that's what's screwing their lives up 

454.50 456.22 A: right [laughter] right right 

461.78 463.06 A: right right 

462.94 463.87 B: (( ah ))

469.77 481.47 B: i went and told him that i didn't need to go see him i said you know 'cause i can sit here if you wanna talk about him i i'll talk about him because i love to talk about my dad but ah talking about him doesn't change the fact and there's that he's gone there's 

472.05 473.01 A: mhm 

477.11 477.91 A: right 

481.30 487.73 B: there's nothing that you can say there's nothing you can do there's no little white pill that you can give me that makes everything all right 

486.69 488.26 A: right that's totally true 

487.89 490.63 B: the only thing that takes care of it is acceptance 

490.57 502.08 B: and move on and realise that [sigh] you know life doesn't stop it goes on with every death there's a creation and everything happens for a purpose so [sigh] it's really it's just a 

490.65 491.47 A: yeah 

495.60 496.58 A: right 

498.31 499.24 A: right 

502.02 507.44 B: mm you've just got to be able to understand it accept it and move on that's the only way to get past it 

507.70 510.09 A: right that's definitely the optimal solution 

509.76 516.66 B: right 'cause you can dwell on it and you can let it ruin your life just in the same way with anything else 

510.73 511.62 A: yeah 

516.63 517.48 A: right 

517.86 519.75 B: (( any bad situation in your life )) 

519.97 521.33 A: yeah yeah 

522.27 525.13 A: so i guess you're a pretty strong person on the inside because of this 

524.82 526.70 B: ah probably so 

526.41 527.23 A: mhm 

526.81 530.46 B: my wife might think i'm too strong [laughter] [laughter] 

528.65 530.17 A: (( [laughter] )) 

532.35 535.07 B: but it's you gotta choice you know you can 

535.71 540.79 B: and and you got choices every day thousands of 'em that we don't ever ever even realise 

540.69 541.52 A: right 

541.10 551.05 B: that we're make every day and it's ah every choice has a consequence and [sigh] ah you can either choose to go on with it or you can choose to [sigh] dwell in it 

546.06 547.73 A: right right 

550.42 554.02 A: yeah all the choices in life can lead us down different routes 

553.65 559.18 B: right exactly it's it's like a river [sigh] it's it it goes 

558.29 560.61 A: gotta flow somewhere [laughter] 

559.47 565.16 B: ah right it all it all goes somewhere you're constantly moving [sigh] but you never know exactly where 

565.03 566.26 A: exactly 

565.70 577.17 B: you're headed in somewhat of a direction if a river's heading south you know you're headed somewhere south but there's so many different branches [sigh] that branch off of it you never know when you where you'll end up and life's the same way 

568.05 569.35 A: mhm 

575.61 576.47 A: right 

577.19 579.11 A: (( right i totally agree yeah so ))

590.47 591.70 A: parents died 

591.24 598.13 B: ah no she never had an opportunity to meet my parents and that is something else i regret ah
