212.29 213.13 B: no 

213.14 219.85 A: so but i'm kind of curious how how they would tempt a person to accept money that way

226.40 227.85 B: yeah

264.85 266.61 B: yeah

316.38 318.29 B: um computers 

318.38 319.80 A: (( oh interesting )) 

318.39 320.68 B: in in the area of ah 

321.07 323.61 B: ah help desk and 

323.87 328.16 B: customer support and ah that sort of thing 

327.84 330.99 A: well i've a question about computers um 

331.68 333.25 A: when you look at 

333.37 336.14 A: you've got the gigahertz g. h. 

335.86 337.47 B: (( ah yeah )) 

336.98 338.38 A: ah now 

338.82 347.18 A: is it the higher the number if you go from what like a one point one to a two is that increasing the capacity of the machine to do things faster right 

345.50 350.10 B: well it increases the speed at which ah things happen 

350.37 352.51 B: you know such as um 

352.95 360.17 B: ah now a lot of the things that you do are not dependant on speed you know i think today's machines are 

357.65 358.51 A: (( yes yes )) 

360.25 365.46 B: ah approaching if they haven't already gotten to three gigahertz 

364.80 365.75 A: yes 

365.47 376.13 B: um but i s- i have a machine that's only four hundred and fifty megahertz which is like one sixth of ah of three gigahertz and um 

373.89 374.87 A: yes 

377.42 379.41 B: most of the things i do 

380.07 386.95 B: wouldn't really be appreciably ah speeded up um 

386.79 387.67 A: right 

387.04 393.52 B: by having a faster machine but if you're into calculating um 

394.34 398.51 B: big spread sheets where there's a lot of ah 

398.59 404.58 B: relationships between one cell and another you know formulas and that sort of thing 

401.87 402.79 A: (( yes )) 

403.93 404.88 A: (( yes yes )) 

404.72 408.08 B: (( where ah if you're doing ah )) 

408.21 410.01 B: (( [cough] games )) 

410.27 411.19 A: yes 

410.52 414.88 B: games that have a lot of ah that are very graphic intensive 

414.96 422.20 B: or um drawing programmes like autocad or things that just have lots of 

423.08 427.17 B: um graphics in 'em those things can 

427.34 430.46 B: benefit from a a high speed machine 

430.43 444.16 A: okay now i've got one other question to ask you um i live in in northern michigan right now they're just beginning to advertise what they call the pipeline which is instead of having a direct dial up modem 

432.37 433.39 B: sure 

444.36 448.93 B: right this would be a high speed ah broadband connection 

444.38 446.11 A: (( um able to )) 

446.30 447.28 A: (( be )) 

448.53 450.24 A: what is it was is that is 

448.99 451.80 B: either through cable or d._s._l. 

450.49 454.95 A: that really fast 'cause i you know i i have satellite t._v. but not cable 

455.56 463.00 B: right well there's two ways to get ah high speed internet one is through a a cable provider 

463.43 468.49 B: and the other is through the ah telephone company through what they call a d._s._l. line 

468.33 469.27 A: (( yeah yes yes )) 

468.91 473.20 B: and ah there is advantages and disadvantages to both but um 

473.29 477.42 B: if you only have one of those available 

477.55 483.03 B: ah and you may not even if you're in a really remote area and you're further than 

483.19 484.29 B: um 

483.84 487.78 A: well i'm three hundred and fifty miles north west of detroit which 

487.54 493.66 B: well it depends on how far you are from the telephone exchange or the last um 

491.81 492.65 A: (( is oh )) 

494.09 495.96 B: ah switch 

496.60 498.97 B: and if you're less than ah 

499.30 501.84 B: a mile or two then um 

501.93 507.66 B: you can get d._s._l. so you call your phone company up and ask them if you're um 

503.34 504.41 A: (( yes yes )) 

507.89 516.99 B: ah if that's available then that would ah that would definitely really ah appreciate um 

517.74 518.84 B: um 

519.32 525.98 B: maybe a a sixty fold increase in how fast you can download something 

524.66 531.43 A: yeah 'cause right now on the m._s._m._x. soft network they only offer um one telephone number 

531.39 533.15 B: right 

531.65 534.81 A: for for for the traverse city michigan area 

534.30 536.04 B: right 

535.30 540.39 A: and if a lot of people ah rang that number at the same time then sometimes those people can't get on it 

540.86 541.85 B: sure 

541.48 542.64 A: you you know 

542.48 549.92 B: well if you have d._s._l. then you don't have to try and you don't have to find a ah a number to call a local number 

542.89 544.00 A: (( yeah yes )) 

550.06 558.40 B: you're always connected and ah it costs maybe twice as much as a dial up ah thing 

558.66 559.56 A: (( yeah yes )) 

560.02 567.51 B: but you know you may think that's worth that you know if you do a lot of downloading or 

568.51 569.64 B: (( ah )) 

570.64 572.50 B: so forth 

571.68 579.51 A: yeah 'cause on my reports for ace hardware those are done online so that each store will see the report in what's called real time because 

579.43 581.24 B: yeah 

579.81 585.32 A: as soon as i submit it then the store manager will receive a copy usually that same day 

585.44 588.56 B: and how big is this report in bytes 

588.75 590.39 A: well that i don't know 

589.81 596.13 B: you don't know is it in a ah spread sheet file or a a word processing file 

595.60 597.19 A: um word processing 

597.37 599.89 B: well those files are not that big to begin
