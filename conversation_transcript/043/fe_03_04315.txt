47.25 57.12 A: if i went back to like i'm still in school right now and like you know because i kept screwing around and like ah i've dropped a few classes here and there so if i got i guess i would say that if i would go back in time 

53.58 54.59 B: mhm 

57.16 69.83 A: one thing that i would do for sure is like you know i would take school more seriously and i would just ah you know buckle down and i can and i i would like graduate sooner when i you know being that my friends already graduated by now and i'm still in school 

69.75 72.12 B: yeah what are you studying right now okay 

71.67 80.04 A: um my major right now is electrical engineering i go to university of illinois chicag- um yeah u._i._c. univ- university of illinois chicago 

79.90 80.98 B: oh okay 

81.08 82.80 B: i actually knew um 

81.36 82.30 A: (( ah ))

113.65 116.64 A: oh wow [laughter] i definitely never heard of that school 

114.86 115.71 B: so 

115.85 120.50 B: yeah i can't remember well that's cool you got electrical engineering what year are ya in 

118.25 118.96 A: but 

120.41 121.93 A: i'm third year 

121.74 123.01 B: you're third year 

122.70 124.66 A: yeah and one for my 

123.38 125.01 B: so you're right around the corner 

124.82 127.85 A: pardon yeah i'm i'm 'bout around the corner not too far 

128.51 130.10 B: that's good 

129.76 132.59 A: um what about you what would say that you would change 

132.04 137.03 B: um the there's i think like you said um i'm not big on regrets 

137.16 138.16 A: uh-huh 

137.32 142.62 B: but i do regret regret ah quitting basketball when i played in high school 

142.66 144.19 A: oh really uh-huh 

143.45 154.71 B: and i played for two years and then quit my junior year because i felt that i wasn't good enough playing time and the coach didn't like me and i was never going to play 

154.74 155.73 A: oh 

155.04 160.17 B: so ah it wasn't it was it wasn't the coach it was all me it was just me ah 

160.22 164.20 B: thinking i should play more but also i regret not um 

165.12 174.93 B: pursuing sports in college to get my education paid for and to possibly further myself in the golfing industry i went to 

174.01 175.57 A: in the golfing industry 

175.38 180.78 B: yeah i went to school actually from ohio state and ah graduated in horticulture 

180.82 183.60 A: (( oh wow that's not a everyday field )) 

181.81 182.99 B: so 

183.70 187.99 B: yeah it's interesting it was ah it was it was a little bit tough 

187.82 201.45 B: but it was ah it's i just run a i run a golf course out here in california on the maintenance side growing the grass keeping everything cut and i really think that i had enough potential to go somewhere in college with 

201.40 211.04 B: with golf if not basketball but i gave up too early and pursued more of a drinking collegiate career 

210.89 213.90 A: oh dude i know all about that issue [laughter] 

211.20 214.70 B: than i did than a yeah rather than a sports career 

214.93 227.23 A: but no i played i played basketball in high school too and i know like i wasn't like i mean i was okay but i wasn't like i was a starter but i know how it goes about getting minutes and all that that could that could get very frustrating at times 

215.08 215.92 B: (( so )) 

226.29 233.10 B: yeah i just i looked at the way the coach he treated my brother two years i i played with my brother for a year 

233.12 245.03 B: in high school and i saw the way that he treated him and my brother actually played division three school but ah for basketball but he was plenty good enough to go 

233.24 234.59 A: mhm 

245.06 249.27 B: division one and actually get a scholarship but our coach kinda screwed him over 

249.50 250.82 A: wow 

249.90 255.84 B: and i i think i held that against him a little bit too much but i was just like you know what i'm not going to let it happen to me 

256.00 258.62 B: so i'm not gonna give this guy the satisfaction 

256.29 257.16 A: oh 

258.59 261.43 A: right what kind a what 

259.42 261.90 B: so that's it i'm just not gonna play anymore 

261.72 263.96 A: yeah what position were you playing 

263.60 266.62 B: um i played shooting guard and point guard 

266.43 270.44 A: oh okay i played flank guard i was the shortest one of the team five ten 

270.72 275.24 B: [laughter] well that that's that's a pretty big team then if you were the shortest guy was five ten 

275.12 277.59 A: yeah yeah they had a pretty decent team 

277.60 285.30 A: but i mean i was like i guess yeah but i was like oh you know i was gonna tell ya that i'm watching the lakers lose right now i don't know if you're a big lakers fan or not 

284.94 291.14 B: um you know what i i can't say i am because i moved out here three years ago when they won their first championship 

291.01 291.90 A: uh-huh 

291.38 300.88 B: so i can't jump on the bandwagon i can't say i moved out here and then they're like oh well you've only liked 'em since they won a championship well that was the exact same time that i moved out here so 

300.92 307.13 B: i just like watching 'em play i like watching any good team play i really like dallas and i'm hoping that dallas ah 

304.14 305.44 A: right right 

307.80 309.64 B: beats up on ah 

310.15 313.81 B: what's who they ah what do they call them now i can't remember the team now 

313.96 315.08 B: [laughter] um 

313.97 315.54 A: oh yeah what it's 

316.15 317.34 A: new new 

316.26 320.66 B: geez who are they playing i just went blank i just saw that they won tonight and 

320.86 323.93 A: you know why i know 'cause i come i'm blanking out too [laughter] 

323.91 324.92 B: wow 

325.05 328.54 B: i can't i'm yeah i'm watching the lakers game right now but 

328.63 334.58 B: they're getting their asses handed to 'em and i think that they're gonna blow it they're gonna lose next game too 

333.51 344.28 A: yeah i saw some statistic before the game started said like the people that ah the people that lose ah that win game five win win eighty three percent of the time win the whole series 

343.79 347.47 B: yeah i can i can believe it san antonio's playing tough 

344.60 345.63 A: so 

347.02 350.82 A: yeah the they're a good team i'm surprised i didn't think they were going to be that good this year 

350.61 351.82 B: yeah 

352.17 354.55 A: (( but ah oh i was )) 

353.17 356.98 B: so what did how long have you been have you been outta school 

357.15 358.98 A: oh i'm gonna school 

357.32 360.79 B: so what did you take a break on school or did you just 

359.41 361.57 A: basically that's yeah 

361.56 367.04 A: that's basically what i did yeah like i took a break like i i wouldn't i wouldn't say it was so much as taking a break 

367.02 380.24 A: but what i was doing is like i would like i would take classes in the beginning of semester and engineering classes are pretty tough i can't like you know you can't really blow 'em off well like all the time like every weekend you know oh usually all the engineering students are studying or whatever 

373.29 374.16 B: yeah 

380.06 392.19 A: or anything like that i'll be the first one to go out i'll be the first one to go drinking pretty much like in towards the end of the semester i'll have to either drop all the classes or if i took five classes i'll end up passing like you know one class and the other 

392.09 404.12 A: and the other classes i will like you know either have to drop or i usually i will drop 'em i wouldn't fail out so i mean it was like you know like they i i currently blame blame it on myself it was like whole lot like a whole bunch of bad decisions i would say 

396.81 397.63 B: yeah 

404.09 413.61 A: because you know one has to be like or rather just like if people wanted to go out with me whatever i would always be ready to go out with everybody whereas a lot of people you know like had better priorities 

413.28 414.53 B: yeah 

414.33 420.68 A: like i don't know like some sometimes i think i would have been better off discipline wise if i would a went to the army or navy or something like that 

420.51 425.63 A: rather than rather than just go like from from college i mean from high school go straight to college 

423.47 424.78 B: straight to college 

425.43 438.85 A: like it's ah you know sometimes it works out for people sometimes it doesn't but i think in my case i would have more discipline but you know what like i'm not like it's not like i'm old right now so i you know as long as i get it together enough to graduate next year i think i'll be pretty pretty okay 

431.10 431.95 B: yeah 

438.47 440.14 B: yeah i mean it's 

439.48 441.20 A: [laughter] 

440.23 442.47 B: i think that a lotta lotta people 

441.68 442.65 A: (( you know )) 

442.43 456.28 B: nowadays feel that that college is for certain people i mean you really have to discipline yourself and i know a bunch of my buddies they did the same thing that the kinda the same boat that you were in but instead of sticking with school 

449.18 450.26 A: yeah 

456.27 462.59 B: they've dropped out and found you know a a job that pays twelve thirteen dollars an hour and they're happy 

462.48 465.34 A: oh i know i know like a lotta yeah 

463.21 473.95 B: and i'm like well you know what your twelve thirteen dollars sounds good when you're you know when you're twenty twenty one i was like but when you're also forty making you know the same amount of money 

474.18 476.23 B: like that doesn't get fun 

476.28 481.80 B: you don't want that anymore i mean everybody i really think you need a college degree to do anything nowadays 

476.51 478.11 A: exactly 

481.78 494.85 A: oh definitely and the thing about it is like that no matter what i ah unless you like you get really lucky without a college degree you'll always end up doing some menial job that like pretty much anybody can do and that's one one thing that would really you know piss me off 

492.31 493.15 B: yeah 

494.39 495.28 B: yeah 

494.63 509.04 A: like you sh- like you know you cannot do anything like this like actually invi- involves thinking i mean i guess speaking broadly but most of the time you can't unless you have a college degree or like otherwise it'd just be like you know something like production worker in any kinda you know s- situation 

508.27 513.45 B: yeah that anybody can do that's what i like about my job 'cause i know if i leave then 

513.90 522.34 B: that there there are gonna be problems for the next person to come in 'cause they don't know how the system was running and they don't know how i was doing it so 

524.15 530.58 A: right yeah so has been ten minutes or [laughter] really 

526.15 527.12 B: but how many 

527.69 535.03 B: um i don't think it's gotta be getting close how many hours you take per quarter now are you in what quarters or semesters 

530.96 531.99 A: i know 

534.47 545.35 A: no we're in semester all of u. i. c. but now like i take about like i'm pretty serious about it so i've got usually fifteen hours but like fifteen hours like it's it's pretty tough in like in engineering like it's 

541.13 542.06 B: (( oh okay )) 

544.41 545.26 B: yeah 

545.34 549.91 A: like i would say like that's like that takes up like it's like almost like a fulltime job i would say 

549.66 551.84 B: yeah oh yeah oh yeah 

551.52 557.10 A: so i mean if i can just stick with it ah i mean i just hope the the economy picks up so that like i can then i'll be 

556.93 569.92 A: e- have a you know have a decent job 'cause that that's one of the things that i like i know one some of my friends not that it's about money but like they graduated like when i would have graduated and right now they're making like a lot more money it's not all about money but still like you know you have to think like 

569.77 580.55 A: you know like if you know if i would have gotten out of like out of school at the right time i could have been a lot better off and it's all coming back that's why i feel not thinking like regrets but if one thing i regret is this one 

575.22 576.13 B: yeah 

580.45 581.40 B: yeah 

581.52 592.16 B: well i mean it it takes money to to do the things that you wanna do and it you hate to say that it is it's not about the money but you gotta pay the bills 

592.15 594.03 A: oh yeah exactly 

592.48 599.01 B: mm and right now with the economy and half the people whatever unemployment was at seven percent or something 

598.73 599.96 A: is it at seven percent 

599.05 599.90 B: (( um ))
