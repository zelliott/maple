0.06 2.03 A: hi my name's terri 

1.79 3.47 B: hi this is lana 

3.35 4.99 A: hi how you doing 

4.54 6.19 B: i'm doing good 

5.58 9.44 A: that's good what do you think about time travel what would you change 

8.99 13.85 B: oh my i don't know you go first i i have to think about that one a bit 

13.69 25.09 A: well honestly if i had to go back in time i would possibly i would probably and actually most definitely go back and change my education path like 

25.33 34.46 A: if i would have [noise] probably have excelled a whole lot better in high school or in junior high than i did that way i would um 

35.40 42.65 A: be in a different position i probably would have finished college at a younger age when like i should have and not had children 

42.82 53.87 A: at a young age like twenty one twenty two years old having my first daughter i would not have had kids that young i would have probably been on a totally different career path 

49.98 51.15 B: (( oh mm mm )) 

53.85 54.51 B: (( mm )) 

53.93 57.02 A: i would not be where i am now um 

57.06 64.23 A: with kids divorced and you know constantly looking for the job and trying to struggle to go back to school 

64.13 65.31 B: (( yeah mm )) 

64.44 68.24 A: that would be like my main focus 'cause it is so important to 

68.60 74.10 A: to i mean i try to tell everybody like even my cousins and things like that that are younger than me 

73.87 86.69 A: i always tell them that a- above all get your education first everything else can wait i got married young had kids young and did everything so young and i feel like i missed so much going to college 

86.11 95.19 B: you know you know that's interesting because i don't know i i i wouldn't change anything and i didn't finish college i got through part of the college and i suppose i 

95.22 108.22 B: i guess the one thing i'd change is when i went to college i worked for my board and room and 'cause my folks couldn't afford anything else and i i would definitely change that and go to a regular college i didn't go to college and actually be a participant i was hardly there 

108.21 115.33 B: but other than that i i'm sixty six years old and i wouldn't i basically wouldn't change anything in my life which is kinda interesting 

115.50 121.06 B: so i don't i don't fit the back in time what would i do different too much i guess ah 

120.08 125.40 A: well you it's interesting that you say that because it seems like um 

125.73 130.77 A: not saying anything about age or anything it's just like people in a younger generation 

130.59 137.60 A: like in my generation in their thirties that the generation x. era we seem to think 

133.33 134.25 B: uh-huh 

137.37 148.64 A: that um things that we did were wrong and everyone's career path and everything education's path educational path is seems to be different it seems like [noise] back in 

148.64 154.85 A: when you were younger you know by you being sixty six years old that was a lo- long before me 

154.59 155.56 B: (( mhm )) 

154.92 159.68 A: that it seems like that people um like 

159.84 162.76 A: women were a little bit more secure in their 

162.83 163.81 A: in their 

163.88 169.66 A: positions as being a housewife or a mom or just being an average worker 

167.63 175.84 B: actually i i wasn't just a housewife i mean i did i did things and i i don't suppose i can i can say i 

176.01 184.21 B: my husband was in in school administration so i basically did substitute teaching which is what fit with that 

182.71 183.70 A: no um 

183.81 198.12 A: right and i'm saying that those like i'm just saying it just seems like it wasn't like a demand you know what i'm saying it wasn't a demand something that you had to go out and do you know what i mean it just seems like now it's like if you don't work it's like [noise] oh boy what are you gonna do 

198.29 199.53 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

198.40 200.22 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

199.72 201.93 A: and i think that's the reason why 

201.93 210.41 A: like i think that way that i just did things so wrong because i look at it if i'd had if i had of got my education i'd go and get a job 

210.27 219.56 A: and they only want to pay you thirty thousand dollars a year and if you've got kids that's nothing comparative to what it is that you could have gotten if you just had that peice of paper 

212.80 213.69 B: yeah 

219.23 223.98 B: yeah that's true although that is not all the answers either sometimes 

223.07 224.52 A: you got a point 

224.08 228.16 B: yeah well have you have you talked on these 

228.44 231.30 B: these calls before have you done very many of them 

231.02 232.63 A: this is my second one 

232.17 237.45 B: oh yeah that's i wasn't home the other night but um but yeah this is my second one too 

237.89 242.57 B: i don't know it's kinda interesting whether you know it's not hard to talk that's for sure [laughter] 

241.83 242.77 A: no 

242.88 246.38 A: but especially like i thought this one was interesting because 

246.77 249.16 A: you know time travel 

248.80 250.19 B: yeah uh-huh 

249.96 257.45 A: it's it's just like i always catch myself saying it man if i had to do it all over again i would of did blah blah blah 

256.91 267.96 B: but you're if you're only in your thirties a lot of people have done done things gone back to school and gotten gotten things done later than that there's nothing that says you couldn't now i mean there is a 

267.07 278.44 A: well i am in school now so i guess that's why i think of it because i'm at school i'm an at home mom right now because i got laid off and i am in school full time i graduate next may 

269.27 270.12 B: oh 

272.59 273.61 B: (( okay uh-huh )) 

276.27 277.31 B: (( mhm )) 

278.03 279.47 B: well good for you 

279.11 283.37 A: and i'm doing my degree in paralegal studies and i want to go to law school 

281.48 282.51 B: (( mhm )) 

283.32 284.46 B: (( pretty good )) 

283.43 292.47 A: so it just seems like by the time i finish the bar and do all the other stuff i'll be in my mid forties [laughter] it seems like that i could have done it 

290.29 291.26 B: (( yeah that's )) 

292.64 300.19 A: ten years before or fifteen years earlier and just did everything on time then i could have enjoyed it 

298.42 299.38 B: yeah 

300.07 312.03 B: course if you doing very young you doing paralegal studies there's nothing says you couldn't work in that for a while say you know and you know see see if you like it and and ah before you go on you know 

311.82 316.58 A: yeah because it is a very demanding it's a demanding position right now 

316.66 331.16 A: um there aren't that many paralegals there are more attorneys than there are paralegals so it is something that is a a high demand so i'm guaranteed to get at least a good paying job ma- making mid forties when i get by school 

321.50 322.56 B: uh-huh 

323.85 325.15 B: (( oh yeah well )) 

329.91 330.78 B: (( yeah )) 

331.04 340.75 B: and you may decide you like that and course i'm a bad one to promote 'cause i i never did finish college and i don't really care i mean i i'm satisfied with what i did 

340.51 354.22 B: and first of all i that i'm retired i i'm working in in like areas 'cause i'm not completely retired i would i could stay home and not work at all but i i i need to keep doing so right now i'm selling tupperware and just having a ball 

353.65 359.22 A: i know that s- sounds like so much fun like doing mystery shopping and all this other stuff i'm having fun 

358.96 359.84 B: yeah 

359.26 366.96 A: sitting at home but it does get a little bit boring at times for me because i'm so used to working and it's just so ironic because in the past 

364.07 364.85 B: (( oh )) 

366.80 377.71 A: i went in the pathway of being an accountant and then once i got laid off and i've done i've done accounting for ten years okay i've done books for major corporations 

370.47 371.38 B: uh-huh 

377.53 378.47 B: (( oh uh-huh )) 

377.54 382.60 A: and when i got laid off i decided i hated it i absolutely could not stand it 

382.94 383.71 B: (( oh )) 

382.95 389.82 A: and it was it was like something that was probably coming over me anyway because i was like i really don't like [laughter] this 

389.45 390.33 B: sure 

389.73 399.96 A: i really don't like doing this job why did i even decide to do this i should have been a lawyer in the first place and this is like all these things i should of could of would of but i didn't 

395.22 396.98 B: (( mm )) 

398.20 399.80 B: (( well that's great )) 

400.20 402.82 B: and you only have a year of school left 

402.30 405.37 A: yeah i have so many credit hours um 

402.87 403.96 B: (( you haven't got )) 

407.48 408.51 A: um 

409.22 411.96 A: that i didn't really need that many to go 

411.70 414.37 B: do you have to go to this this summer too then 

414.01 416.56 A: yeah i'm taking three classes this summer 

417.26 420.81 A: um five classes in the fall and four classes in the spring 

420.90 422.62 B: well good for you well

428.73 443.64 A: and um i just finished my final ah my legal memorandum and by two briefs for my research and writing class and i seem to have a flair for the writing so it it just made me feel really good because i just made me feel real confident 

438.78 439.91 B: (( mm )) 

443.50 444.40 B: (( good mhm )) 

444.26 448.94 A: and like i- i think it's because like also in my past m- 

449.55 456.49 A: i had a a- abusive ex-husband who didn't allow me to go back to school and didn't allow me to do things and had i not 

452.12 455.15 B: (( hm )) 

456.78 461.92 A: h- i- it seems to me if i had of went to school and did what i was supposed to do 

462.66 467.22 A: then i wouldn't of never married him 'cause i wouldn't of met him 'cause i would have been in college 

466.67 468.99 B: (( but then you wouldn't have your how many kids do you have )) 

468.25 472.72 A: i have two babies and i wouldn't have had my babies and those are my babies and i love 'em to death 

472.36 473.29 B: sure

499.21 501.18 A: yeah i'm trying [laughter] 

500.47 505.75 B: so you don't need to have to you don't worry about the past that you didn't do [laughter]
