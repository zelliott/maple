23.80 26.58 A: i live in minnesota elk river minnesota 

24.15 32.30 B: [noise] i mean okay i'm from well i'm in dallas right now i'm actually from indiana so 

31.68 33.46 A: what part of indiana 

33.00 35.40 B: i'm from gary 

35.06 36.44 A: gary okay 

36.60 38.65 A: i graduated from indianapolis 

36.71 45.46 B: (( yeah )) 

40.11 40.67 A: (( [cough] )) 

41.01 43.98 A: so marcus if somebody offered you a million dollars 

44.02 45.44 A: and all you had to do was 

45.72 48.88 A: never talk to your best friend again would you take it 

48.85 50.23 B: (( ah okay um )) 

50.93 63.76 B: hm strangely enough i'd actually for some reason this is not this is the second time this question has come up in my life i don't know why no one's actually done it but someone's asked me this question before 

66.17 76.56 B: um i don't i don't think i could do that i don't think i could do it because um i i know you know knowing who my best friend is i mean 

76.38 89.21 B: like one person i can really relate to more so than many other people that you know that i know so while you know while a million dollars would be nice i don't know if i could just you know 

89.12 97.89 B: give up speaking to you know that person ah ever again so no i don't think i could do it i don't think i could do 

91.26 92.60 A: (( hm )) 

99.03 105.41 A: well it it would have depended on what part of my life they'd asked me if they'd asked me twenty years ago 

103.39 136.44 B: (( it )) 

105.87 112.14 A: i said yes 'cause i didn't have anything i anyone i considered my best friend [lipsmack] um 

112.34 119.49 A: now it's a different question no i don't think i would i have two best friends more or less i have my my wife 

119.92 122.31 A: and that would be kinda hard not to talk to her 

122.82 126.40 A: and then i have also have another i have a male friend who is 

126.90 130.69 A: ah i consider my best friend so i would have twice as much 

131.46 136.06 A: or twice as many problems not ah honoring this 

136.15 142.86 A: so i i guess i would have to say that there would really not be any realistic way that i could take the million dollars 

143.36 145.78 A: and and fulfill the obligation 

145.83 149.85 B: (( [laughter] right [laughter] mm yeah i yeah i [sigh] [laughter] mm )) 

149.16 152.64 A: i'd try to negotiate for maybe seven fifty for 

151.15 152.74 B: (( but )) 

152.82 155.42 A: part time communication or something 

153.22 158.73 B: yeah if yeah if i could do they could do that i mean they're 

158.65 168.51 B: now i i mean i would be i'm going to be honest i mean you know like you know like very best friend no you know um no but you know 

168.78 177.73 B: there i mean there's some other people who [laughter] like if you you know you could offer me you know a couple of hundred bucks if i never spoke okay fine you know but 

176.35 177.70 A: [laughter] 

178.80 185.58 B: um yeah yeah that [sigh] i don't think i could no i couldn't do that i couldn't do that at all right 

185.67 196.04 A: well seeing as there are very few people that i that i personally carry on any kind of conversation with in a intimate ongoing personal way 

187.33 205.49 B: (( yeah )) 

196.28 201.84 A: i have a small pool of um resources that would be for me it would be 

202.09 204.36 A: ah it would make for a very empty 

205.21 209.94 A: ah situation immediately and um isolate me 

210.05 212.79 A: and i wouldn't like that 

213.27 216.01 A: i don't have many people i would consider friends 

213.55 225.30 B: i yeah so you have right right i'm i'm much see i'm much the same way i don't have very many really close friends so 

216.05 217.47 A: in other words 

224.56 225.52 A: yes 

225.41 229.67 B: to get rid of you know the one's that i have you 

229.74 244.65 B: know would it would be i mean would be very difficult so yeah but i mean but there's some you know there are some that you know other people might consider it if they were in a situation close that you know if it counted for this like okay 

244.57 255.64 B: you know yeah fine okay i see these people every day yeah you know i could live without them but not the people i consider close there's no way there's absolutely no way no no 

255.41 265.26 B: (( ah )) 

255.95 259.04 A: no not for me i would um 

259.91 264.14 A: i wouldn't do it i wouldn't be able to consider it very long and um 

264.93 275.08 A: [lipsmack] i don't think in that case the money would be able to buy me any kind of satisfaction or contentment and ultimately i believe it would probably just destroy my life 

275.25 276.94 B: (( i )) 

277.17 278.47 B: i mean e- 

278.52 293.07 B: e- i mean i probably would i mean i would yeah i would just feel guilty about taking it after a while for one reason or another either because i decided to take it and give up a friendship or because i would cheat and end up talking to you know 

292.69 299.22 A: yeah i could probably live with the cheating better easier than i could with losing a friend ah but either way 

293.18 296.66 B: (( those people hm right )) 

297.32 298.65 B: (( no yeah that's )) 

299.44 342.48 B: (( true )) 

299.62 300.63 A: um 

301.53 305.76 A: i don't know if i'd feel guilty i don't think i'd even submit to it it would be [lipsmack] 

306.04 310.64 A: ah it would be intolerable for me i don't think i would be able to withstand the ah 

310.77 313.40 A: like you say the pressure of it for very long 

314.52 319.72 A: i would like some money that would be fine that'd be nice but ah at what price i don't i don't ah 

320.21 324.19 A: i don't think it would quite justify it so it's not much of a 

324.74 329.62 A: i wouldn't call it much of a benefactor that would want to set up those kind of situations anyway 

330.74 335.04 A: i would wonder what their ulterior motive was what they were gonna get from it um 

335.35 339.02 A: or something you know i wouldn't [laughter] i wouldn't really feel very 

339.33 343.06 A: ah positive about somebody and call them a benefactor that want which 

343.27 347.48 A: who would wish to ah alter my life 

346.90 357.44 B: in in in and that dramatic of a fashion certainly certainly yeah 

349.87 351.54 A: yeah 

351.97 354.31 A: so it would leave me 

354.56 357.59 A: pretty pretty much i would just say good bye 

358.00 358.95 A: (( and ah )) 

358.19 362.77 B: (( yeah i think i'd just yeah there's i mean there's a )) 

362.91 371.10 B: i don't you know i don't know of any other answer than just to yeah to walk away i can't even think you know 

371.28 385.27 B: i wonder what type of person it would you know it would you know well maybe it maybe it's not what type of person would take it it's just someone who you know like like you said you know earlier in your life that just didn't have someone 

371.50 372.55 A: well 

385.84 388.01 B: you know that would be 

386.01 388.62 A: well yeah i had a much more negative 

389.13 392.53 A: outlook on life i didn't really care for people so 

391.69 392.86 B: (( right )) 

392.66 403.45 A: living without 'em you know i didn't even have contact with my my own family you know i did so so so divorcing myself from strangers would not have been a big deal 

394.85 401.30 B: (( right )) 

403.33 407.81 A: or wh- which would more or less have been just ac- acquaintances 

404.86 415.43 B: (( right right )) 

408.00 411.67 A: there was nobody really that i knew in my life at that time that really 

411.96 412.95 A: um 

413.06 416.36 A: knew anything about me truthfully or 

415.58 423.14 B: (( exactly and that )) 

416.54 423.41 A: ah so being not very close it wouldn't have been a big deal and i could have gone out and and had that kind of relationship 

423.51 427.28 A: [lipsmack] any any time of the day with any of the new acquaintances 

427.41 436.45 B: and that's really the only way i could see even you know 

427.58 431.03 A: so that in that case it wouldn't have been a a problem 

437.85 438.59 A: (( yep )) 

438.04 443.09 B: where where where you know where it would be feasible where it would even be you know 

443.55 448.12 B: where anyone would ever you know could actually do that if if you know 

448.00 451.76 A: well i just wonder how would they monitor this how would they how would they verify 

448.44 456.12 B: (( yeah yeah how who do they you know 'cause i )) 

453.16 458.16 A: ah i would have to give them a list of my best friends or what [laughter] 

456.23 461.80 B: true 'cause i could just i could just say it's one person and not tell them who it actually 

459.72 460.45 A: yeah 

461.78 470.06 A: exactly i could give them anything so i don't how would they how would they tell and then and then how would they monitor ongoing 

464.50 478.04 B: (( is i mean you know [cough] )) 

470.13 471.05 A: um 

471.06 475.43 A: you know you could tell them you know just tell them anything you wanted basically 

475.78 487.55 A: [lipsmack] so it ah tell them about your ex-wife now that's gonna really you know [laughter] that's gonna be a tough one there to ah uphold you know right yeah my ex-wife's my best friend well give me the money 

481.55 490.50 B: (( right [laughter] yeah )) 

488.72 491.41 A: so i don't think it would work so well 

491.31 499.79 B: (( [laughter] no i don't yeah )) 

492.00 498.04 A: they have to come up with a little a few more guidelines probably the page two of the of the ah 

499.25 500.33 A: offer 

500.15 505.97 B: yeah that's right you have some somewhere in the fine print somewhere i'm sure you know right right that's 

504.08 515.43 A: there you go yeah there you go the small print and i don't know they'd have have how would they would verify that who are they to you know i could say i don't have any best friends or or 

506.25 515.38 B: (( true )) 

515.57 516.96 A: make up somebody 

517.41 521.11 B: (( that is true )) 

517.44 519.92 A: which they couldn't prove otherwise 

522.41 527.35 A: so i would ah yeah i might try to cheat them and get their money 

522.43 531.86 B: (( yeah [laughter] yeah that's yeah yeah that's that's )) 

528.31 530.76 A: [laughter] rather than cheat myself 

531.68 547.99 B: (( true )) 

533.87 537.55 A: so i don't know if they'd find anybody to take it i'm sure they would 

539.58 543.67 A: i wonder if then if they would ask for payment back in interest if they caught you mm 

548.06 553.10 B: um ah i'm yeah i mean brought up a good point i can't i mean 

553.15 562.45 B: not you know just thinking about who would do it and i'm trying to think about yeah how would it work how you know yeah 

561.49 574.45 A: well it would be very hard for them to monitor or to you know i know a lot of people that are married and their spouse isn't their best friend so you could ah you could give up all kinds of names and whatever 

562.22 582.24 B: (( it )) 

575.21 589.09 A: or you could ah give up your best friend and just it was it any at all or was it what verbal communication could you write 'em letters would christmas cards be vi- violated you know [laughter] or is it just ah would emails you know or would it be face to face verbal 

582.01 591.66 B: (( wouldn't work very well but right right right yeah i mean right you know and you )) 

591.71 599.96 B: know and when you know my best friend from when now from elementary school from you know college 

595.28 596.13 A: (( you know )) 

597.75 598.88 A: (( yeah exactly ))
