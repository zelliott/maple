123.84 125.81 A: getting in more into my business

138.68 146.26 A: yes it's um oh it's called kinder music it's a for preschool children and also well from infants to preschool up to kindergarten 

146.59 161.52 A: and i really enjoy it it's probably i get more out of it than the children do it's a lot of good therapy for me and after being with ah in the business field like i worked in industry for seventeen years and men can be so crude and [laughter] swearing and cursing 

152.27 154.20 B: (( that's good )) 

159.74 161.57 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

161.42 164.48 A: do gross things and y- you know i've put up with that

168.92 170.93 B: i'm sure i'm sure 

171.19 173.59 B: well that's good that you started with um 

173.84 181.36 B: well you know i remember you know young i remember and at my school we had music but we learnt on clarinets 

181.16 182.51 A: (( oh i see )) 

181.90 184.91 B: that didn't motivate me that much we all had clarinets 

183.48 184.57 A: (( all right yeah )) 

185.55 196.01 A: well that was yeah my first love and at but you know everybody seems to think that wasn't the practical thing to do so people steered me in other directions and i listened to them and and that's when 

194.88 200.13 B: oh i hate that i did the same thing with acting and i'm acting now but i i 

200.16 207.83 B: i mean sometimes i think ah i'd a had a um gone to julliard or four year college and studied acting and take an acting program but 

207.01 208.73 A: oh yeah great well 

207.99 210.53 B: i mean i've taken plenty of classes now 

211.03 221.07 B: ah but yeah i've i i um didn't didn't seek that out until i was twenty two twenty three first started taking classes and i mean i'm 

222.38 227.85 B: i i just turned thirty recently but ah i wish i had yeah i had ah 

224.60 225.69 A: oh that's 

226.78 232.23 A: no it's not not that old because i didn't even go back to college seriously until i was twenty seven so 

232.36 239.96 A: you know you still have quite a few more years to go and i'm i'm fifty six you know so getting into my fourteenth career here but 

239.40 240.63 B: [laughter] 

240.45 241.48 A: (( but ah )) 

240.90 241.60 B: well 

241.95 256.34 A: you know you can talk about things you regret and what you things you could change in the last well ten years i had a lot of family members and it makes you think about your own life and things i wish i had changed and i mean there are so many things you know like different relationships i wish i would have 

254.26 255.85 B: mhm 

256.11 260.81 A: developed more and things i wish i wouldn't have done and should have done and didn't do 

259.87 267.84 B: yeah relationship wise too [laughter] um i don't i don't think that's a biggie though with me i mean ah 

262.54 263.58 A: right 

269.52 271.89 B: yeah [laughter] 

271.19 272.80 A: well and then too they oh 

272.04 279.34 B: i wouldn't waste my time back to you know if i could only change one thing i wouldn't waste it on some guy or something [laughter] 

277.03 278.28 A: (( really )) 

278.29 286.48 A: well like well there's always you know with family members too like because when my daughter was growing up i was busy going to school and working a couple of jobs and 

281.36 282.12 B: (( mm )) 

286.46 295.54 A: now she's grown and gone and i don't feel like we're as close as we could be and because she's brought it up to me a couple of times well you were always so busy going to school and you didn't have time for me and 

295.50 296.46 B: (( hm )) 

295.61 299.35 A: now it's reversed and she doesn't have time for for me you know so 

298.83 299.95 B: mhm 

299.92 305.70 A: that's why i feel well maybe all those things weren't that important that i did i should have concentrated on the 

305.76 314.40 A: what's there in front of you right now don't worry about yesterday or tomorrow you know worry about what's going on right today that's probably the more important thing in life 

314.50 315.53 B: yeah 

315.38 318.40 A: then we won't have regrets if we do that probably you 

319.23 320.70 B: mhm right [laughter] 

320.11 323.33 A: know yeah take things in increments and 

323.97 324.73 B: (( right hm )) 

324.94 327.26 A: and ah you know like i like i said i was 

327.44 330.83 A: wasn't concentrating on what i should have been concentrating on probably 

333.03 336.04 A: yeah but i think you're right but career choices are something 

336.28 349.24 A: although they're they're not etched in stone nowadays at one time they used to say people would only have ah one to three careers now people are having five to seven so it's never too late to change and never too late to go back to school and learn 

349.48 359.55 B: really how many [laughter] boy you could juggle that many well i'm i'm a professional day job juggler myself [laughter] because i'm an actress 

350.95 352.60 A: [laughter] 

356.98 358.72 A: oh really [laughter] 

359.56 360.76 A: (( oh that's great )) 

359.75 363.28 B: can't get a can't get enough um work 

363.00 368.53 A: right i know what you mean yes see with my music because it's a relatively small town and there aren't that many 

369.08 375.41 A: students i could teach probably but i keep trying you know and different a- avenues of music i'm trying to get into 

376.32 378.19 A: but it's probably similar 

377.36 383.82 B: [noise] yeah well it takes a long time to learn what you do have you done this as a hobby first 

383.48 396.79 A: well you know when i was younger i took um few you know piano lessons and and i ah every like every five years it seemed like i would take it up again and then because of money or time constraints i would quit but about um let's see 

397.19 408.58 A: six years ago i started back and and i had a teacher who was ah had a masters from julliard and i really learned quite a bit from him in five years and the last year or two i've been taken more jazz 

405.78 406.85 B: mhm 

408.69 411.53 A: because i studied a lot of classical with the previous teacher 

411.82 418.10 A: and i probably feel i have a college degree in those two years from everything they taught me 

418.88 421.38 A: then the kinder music that's just a um 

421.50 423.57 A: like about a three month course it's 

423.90 428.47 A: relatively easy you know you just become certified as a preschool teacher 

429.95 432.65 A: but ah like i'm really enjoying that 

430.08 431.30 B: mhm 

431.71 435.34 B: so if someone were to ask you how long you've been playing piano what would you say 

435.01 438.90 A: um well since i was about eight 

438.95 440.79 A: but i 

440.60 444.15 B: mhm so it's all your life but yet you've taken long breaks hm 

441.86 442.69 A: right 

443.48 444.51 A: right 

445.55 458.63 A: but yeah i still played at home or you know i just because i didn't study for formally with a teacher i was still playing at home but i wish i had you know worked a little harder at it when i was younger then i wouldn't have to work so hard at it now [laughter] 

458.93 462.40 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

463.20 463.92 A: (( but )) 

463.32 470.26 B: i i think a lot of things like that well i wish i had started younger like i wish i had started acting younger because it would have been easier 

470.03 471.47 A: mhm 

470.85 472.16 B: but um 

472.36 473.07 A: that's 

472.43 476.66 B: you know i wish i had you know done a lot of things but hey [laughter] [noise] 

475.89 481.94 A: right but still you hear a lot of success stories of people who started later in life in acting and 

482.01 485.59 A: like that woman that plays g- ah george castanza's mother on um 

486.11 490.71 A: seinfeld she was probably in her sixties when she started acting you know 

490.61 494.22 B: yeah that is one good thing about acting i mean you 

494.88 503.11 B: i mean there there are more roles available for certain ages but you can basically do it any time in your life it's not like um 

498.57 499.37 A: right 

501.28 502.49 A: mhm 

504.17 504.94 B: (( well )) 

505.00 509.50 B: dancing [laughter] you know i'm not sixteen anymore [laughter] 

506.72 507.44 A: true 

508.68 511.57 A: right now where do you live in new york still 

511.25 511.99 B: yes 

511.62 516.88 A: okay well you haven't well that's the heart of it so [laughter] you'll at least you have some opportunities there 

514.79 516.16 B: mhm 

516.60 526.67 B: yeah you know i perform a lot actually um [lipsmack] it's you know non union stuff and i'm not i'm not making any money m- usually but 

519.25 520.00 A: (( okay )) 

526.72 527.64 B: i mean 

528.22 535.55 B: i get to i get to do great roles which is great i'm in a theater company i get to do really great roles well where are you ah located 

530.52 531.46 A: (( mhm oh good )) 

535.54 538.48 A: in ohio about halfway between 

538.56 552.19 A: cleveland and pittsburgh it's not a very big to- well about a hundred thousand people and and it's a metropolitan area probably i guess about a million in this you know overall area but it's still with like if 

552.19 553.85 A: fifty miles either way 

553.48 561.04 B: this is the third time i've called and they always pair me with someone far away from the midwest or you know this is nice [laughter] 

557.93 559.78 A: oh really [laughter] 

561.09 564.26 B: i don't meet ah many people from ohio so 

563.81 565.79 A: (( oh how about that )) 

565.22 566.26 B: mhm 

566.03 572.00 A: you know i this is yeah my third call and um i had somebody from wisconsin and somebody else from new york the other night 

572.20 573.13 B: oh 

572.60 575.50 A: and somebody from l._a. one other time that was it yeah 

574.95 579.39 B: (( oh yeah that's the other place to be for acting [laughter] )) 

577.88 579.37 A: right 

580.30 586.69 B: yeah and so i suppose if i could i mean i always think that i mean it's funny that i said physics or something like that because 

586.63 596.94 B: i always think ah well i would have take- taken an acting program somewhere but now the question was formally put to me on the telephone and i picked something else i guess um 

598.18 599.91 B: it's not so much that ah
