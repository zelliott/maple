90.12 94.07 B: and it turned out to be the worst disaster my 

94.38 96.02 B: now ex-boyfriend

135.18 135.77 B: for that

193.33 195.98 B: did me the way he did and i think maybe there's 

194.65 195.00 A: (( )) 

196.28 196.69 B: you know 

196.93 199.33 B: they are the ones that know but i wish they would tell me 

199.46 201.92 A: yeah are they are they around there somewhere 

199.56 200.95 B: be man and woman enough to tell me 

201.57 201.93 B: no 

202.78 206.53 A: so they they aren't even close by where you even see -em or have to deal with -em 

206.62 208.18 B: well i'm (( )) i have to deal with my ex- 

207.73 208.32 A: yeah oh 

208.51 212.85 B: yeah i mean um i know about where he is but i don't have no dealing with him

218.38 219.61 B: but i have no dealings with her 

219.97 220.88 A: wow 

221.12 223.00 B: so i would definitely take the million dollars 

223.17 225.94 B: and be on my way and i'm sure i would be a lot happier 

226.13 228.86 A: well i can see why you know i never thought about it 

229.08 231.51 A: from that that whole angle when i when i 

229.18 230.43 B: oh 

231.88 233.47 A: you know heard the question i thought 

234.03 235.00 A: well no 

235.50 239.72 A: uh you know i wouldn't take a million dollars you know i would i would hurt my friend 

235.64 236.01 B: mhm 

237.73 238.13 B: hm 

239.42 239.95 B: mhm 

240.30 242.97 A: but i never thought about the possibility 

243.54 244.26 A: that they could 

244.70 246.41 A: could stab you in the back some day 

246.45 247.09 B: oh yeah 

247.20 247.80 B: i don't even 

247.22 250.92 A: you know what if what if this question was poised to your very best friend 

251.07 252.05 B: yeah i know 

251.41 257.08 A: or my ve- my very best friend and then and then she said well yeah i'll take it and not speak to (( mary )) any 

257.20 257.75 A: anymore 

257.84 258.25 B: yeah 

258.50 259.48 A: i would be 

260.46 261.36 A: flabbergasted 

261.55 263.22 A: that she would even think to do that 

262.80 264.01 B: mhm mhm 

264.30 265.68 A: so that is a whole new 

265.94 268.06 A: new angle that i haven't thought about 

268.33 271.62 B: yeah it was devastating to me i was uh i mean because we used to 

271.79 273.07 B: we went to school together 

273.39 275.64 B: we used to ride together with our parents 

275.78 278.12 B: um i mean we went to the mall together 

277.88 278.61 A: uh-huh 

278.38 280.76 B: we bought each other clothes we shared food 

280.74 281.62 A: wow

283.21 285.01 A: yeah was this all through school 

285.22 285.62 B: yeah 

286.07 286.69 A: gee 

286.26 287.18 B: all through school 

287.50 289.78 B: and even after school we went to junior college 

290.16 291.98 B: and we still stayed in touch we 

292.08 292.39 B: went 

292.55 295.48 B: and did things together we still went to the mall together we 

295.77 297.06 B: we did a lot of things together 

297.23 300.80 A: so you were in your basically early twenties when this all happened 

300.96 301.56 B: uh 

301.78 302.17 B: no 

302.90 304.75 B: no we were still buddies in my twenties

305.69 306.06 B: mhm 

306.03 306.92 A: wow 

307.01 308.83 B: it was (( )) all like 

308.20 309.46 A: yeah 

308.97 309.49 B: thirty 

310.20 311.52 B: and i don't know i mean 

312.22 313.43 B: my ex- i thought 

313.81 316.29 B: that would be my husband -cause i thought so much of him 

315.02 315.46 A: uh-huh 

316.73 319.01 B: and i tried to help him as much as i could and he 

319.28 320.56 B: boy he did a number on me 

320.88 322.19 A: i guess so 

322.13 323.30 B: he stole money from me 

323.53 324.20 B: when i was sick 

324.58 325.37 A: oh 

325.14 328.41 B: and he took advantage of you know my my generosity because 

328.42 329.06 A: right 

328.50 330.17 B: he he knew that i was sick 

330.72 332.48 B: he knew that i was really down 

332.70 335.17 B: and he knew that i wasn't really (( acting )) myself 

335.36 337.48 B: so he took the opportunity 

337.98 340.53 B: to con me out of five thousand dollars 

340.68 342.11 A: oh my gosh 

341.97 342.62 B: oh yeah 

343.09 343.84 B: yes he did 

343.58 344.90 A: where where are 

345.01 346.99 A: the morals 

346.39 348.29 B: oh i don't think he know what that word is 

347.31 347.78 A: (( )) 

348.22 354.35 A: do you know that you don't do that because not only was he your boyfriend at that time he was a very very good friend too 

353.91 354.60 B: exactly 

355.07 356.28 B: and i thought the world of him 

355.19 359.06 A: and he did that to you so you had two good friends do that to you 

356.65 356.99 B: yeah 

358.29 358.80 B: yeah 

359.07 359.53 B: yeah 

359.68 360.11 B: yeah 

360.43 361.48 B: and i don't even know 

361.64 362.25 B: why 

363.09 363.70 A: huh 

363.27 363.88 B: i'm just 

364.08 366.46 B: if somebody could just give me a why 

366.94 368.46 B: you know they did this to me 

368.25 368.83 A: uh-huh 

368.99 370.34 B: especially when i was sick 

370.47 371.88 B: that is what makes (( )) 

372.25 381.18 B: they knew i was sick they knew that i was on medication they knew that i was going to the doctor they knew that i was working half days because i was not able to work all day 

380.68 381.30 A: uh-huh 

381.40 381.94 A: uh-huh 

381.54 383.38 B: they knew that my aunt had passed away 

383.55 384.51 B: they knew all of these things 

384.82 387.42 A: yet they yet they stabbed you in the back and stole money 

387.54 388.17 B: exactly 

388.87 389.63 A: well 

389.01 393.34 B: even though he you know i i was giving it to him but not really as myself 

393.45 394.03 A: right 

393.90 396.52 B: realizing what i was doing -cause if i was thinking like i am now 

396.73 397.19 A: he wouldn't of 

396.86 397.13 B: i 

397.38 398.04 B: i wouldn't have done it 

398.10 398.60 A: no 

399.57 400.12 A: no 

400.19 401.81 B: so he took advantage of my illness 

401.99 403.11 B: and then helpless 

403.78 406.08 B: and got all five thousand dollars from me 

405.08 405.68 A: (( )) 

406.24 409.36 A: then where do you decide who is your friend now 

409.41 412.35 B: right so um i'll take the money so what about you 

413.08 414.28 A: well i i guess 

414.48 417.15 A: since i haven't had anybody stab me in the back 

417.15 417.92 B: uh-huh that is great 

418.30 419.62 A: that i can think of 

420.88 422.54 A: i've had my feelings hurt 

422.47 422.89 B: uh-huh 

423.63 423.90 A: but 

424.69 428.34 A: you know it's just some of those things are immaterial and you have to get over it 

428.41 428.80 B: right 

429.11 431.55 A: you know it's not a not a big issue like yours are 

431.69 432.45 B: right okay

452.98 454.30 B: i don't have that at all 

454.49 456.32 A: but even if you go into it 

456.99 458.76 A: you are going to be so squeamish 

459.45 459.83 B: yeah 

459.53 461.23 A: about who you can trust 

461.23 461.66 B: right

465.21 465.76 B: mhm
