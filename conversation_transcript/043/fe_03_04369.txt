60.67 62.14 B: exactly 

65.77 73.69 A: but no it's like that ah movie um where the girl she was married to the husband and she only had a she had to sleep with that guy 

70.37 71.47 B: yeah 

73.17 74.57 B: yeah yep 

73.76 76.06 A: i don't remember what it was called 

75.57 80.80 B: um indecent proposal or something like that something like that i know exactly what you're talking about though yeah

78.78 79.91 A: and 

80.08 84.81 A: yeah and ah it like it sound it sounds so wonderful like oh god it would 

84.88 94.06 A: solve all your problems but um i think that is i don't if they would they became together at the end or it just it became more havoc than it was worth 

93.42 95.92 B: yeah i think they they got together but then 

96.14 100.64 B: i think it was always in the back of her mind and her boyfriend who was that woody harrelson or something 

100.15 101.66 A: very good 

100.78 104.61 B: yeah it was in it was always in his head like he was comparing himself 

104.18 112.38 A: exactly so ah you know my best friend is ah is so awesome that i ca- i can just never imagine um 

105.11 106.17 B: and 

112.42 119.42 A: not talking with her you know what i mean over whatever and you know it would like be heartbreaking to say oh you chose 

113.63 114.57 B: yeah 

119.33 129.61 A: our friendship over money even though it was a lot of money [laughter] but um no so but i wonder if if they did like a really big um 

120.82 122.05 B: exactly 

123.34 125.42 B: [laughter] 

129.60 135.42 A: i wonder if they did ever a survey what would be the percentages of females and 

134.70 136.61 B: yeah what their decisions would be 

136.06 143.05 A: yeah and that'd be it wouldn't that be kind of interesting to find out like what what they would what they would choose you know 

136.65 137.70 B: yeah 

142.21 143.49 B: oh definitely 

143.20 145.65 A: so you obviously would say no also 

145.08 146.12 B: yeah 

145.83 146.90 A: yeah 

146.24 151.68 B: because you know something look at all these baseball players that are making millions every year and they're asking for more 

151.36 153.29 A: i know agreed [mn] 

152.65 155.44 B: yeah i mean i understand yeah they're working and all that 

155.45 157.76 B: garbage but you know 

157.92 163.20 B: it's obviously you know like 'cause you know when they were growing up a lot of them grew up with nothing 

162.98 164.12 A: were happy 

163.78 175.73 B: right and once they got a contract where they were making two hundred thousand it was like you know the biggest thing in the world and what it is two three years later and they want like sixty four million over x. amount of years that's that's just insane 

169.35 170.39 A: mhm 

173.98 175.06 A: yeah 

175.37 176.31 A: i know 

175.76 177.16 B: absolutely insane 

176.57 189.88 A: it is and i honestly think that they should have a like a capped salary or a limit because you know it's it's great what they're doing and and whatever but even in the basketball i mean all the sports i mean 

181.42 182.50 B: me too 

189.13 190.42 B: mhm 

189.69 204.67 A: es- especially baseball i mean it's it's unbelievable what these these guys make and everything and like you said before like it becomes greed you know y- if you say oh i'll sacrifice my my best friend for the money what else would you sacrifice 

198.11 199.00 B: yeah 

203.90 215.97 B: mhm i mean sports are supposed to be you know oh let's let's take the family you know technically you know stereotypically it's you know the father and the son or the father and the two sons go to a baseball game on the weekends and you know do the male bonding 

204.52 205.97 A: you know a- and 

214.05 214.95 A: mhm 

215.75 219.59 B: but it's like nowadays you have to have like two hundred dollars to do that 

219.01 220.24 A: exactly 

219.74 224.60 B: i mean unless you want to sit up in the nosebleed section with binoculars that's not very enjoyable for me 

222.36 227.13 A: exactly [laughter] yeah no but i- it is because it um 

227.35 240.44 A: i know because i have a family of it's a family of four of us my husband and i and my two kids and as much as you want to i mean i live up rocklyn and and you know to go all the way there and and to spend and then the parking and then et cetera et cetera 

240.26 243.25 A: but um getting back i mean even if um 

243.21 250.31 A: you know like even if you had a lot of money to do these these things you know what i call my b- ah my best friend for 

250.12 261.05 A: for anything you know and i've had ah so many friendships so many years so that you know i just um you know and t- realize never to talk with her again or him again 

251.14 252.05 B: yeah 

260.64 261.66 B: mhm 

260.89 272.52 A: that would that would i don't know that would be heartbreaking to me and stuff but you know it's nice but i would like to win it in some other fashion i'm kind of just would like just a little extra i don't need a million dollars to make me happy 

263.89 264.77 B: yeah 

272.18 272.89 B: (( no )) 

272.53 276.16 A: you know people think you need a lot to you know to 

275.63 279.72 B: give me an extra twenty grand a year and i'll be i'll be so happy [laughter] 

278.50 279.98 A: right this 

279.99 290.52 A: for life and get you right twenty thousand is that's a lot of people really realistically probably can use you know to make their lives a little bit richer but that 

281.12 282.02 B: mhm 

287.03 288.56 B: exactly yeah 

290.30 297.24 A: million dollars is um is quite you know then you know what happens then you then you spend it and then you get foolish 

297.01 310.70 A: and then sometimes that could change a person you know you could you could turn around and be like the nicest person and to get all that money that changes you when people say it doesn't change them i i find it very hard it changes you somehow 

298.97 299.98 B: mhm 

305.04 305.91 B: yeah 

310.24 311.29 B: mhm 

310.55 323.00 A: some way whether you become more selfish or maybe you it becomes like you think that oh you b- you think you're greater than you are it it does change you it it people i- they just can't say that it doesn't you know i 

313.41 314.28 B: yeah 

322.22 324.21 B: we've got to think nowadays too i mean 

324.42 336.89 B: you know with the real estate market where it is if you want a million dollars and you wanted to buy an nice house say the house is going to be like four fifty you know and you've got to get furniture for it you know you're not going to have much of that million left that's going to go by really quick 

330.76 331.51 A: know 

334.48 335.32 A: (( i know )) 

336.29 343.73 A: yeah unless it is actually a million dollars they're giving you and just say oh i'm going to give you a million dollars and then you know what taxes will hit you 

343.26 344.27 B: exactly 

343.62 354.91 A: you know you'll get your [laughter] they you don't always get that whole amount of you don't get the whole amount even though people say you're getting this you know you get hit in some form 

344.43 346.65 B: [laughter] 

354.97 361.78 A: or another and you know it's nice to ha- people i think nowadays too people are very hung up with material 

361.14 362.44 B: mhm 

361.68 369.84 A: they're i'm you know the- we're in a society where you know the m- more things you have the nicer your car the bigger your house 

369.66 383.11 A: et cetera et cetera it ma- that's the it's such a status thing i you know and and i live in an area that it's a beautiful area but a lot of people put that um you know make like their car's a status thing or their house 

373.93 374.74 B: yeah 

382.96 387.61 A: you know and that's not all that's not the key to life that's not you know what i mean 

387.09 388.20 B: yeah 

387.67 390.49 A: it's not you know that's not the ah 

390.87 393.61 A: that doesn't buy happiness you know what i'm saying 

392.32 395.05 B: no it definitely doesn't yeah i agree 

394.03 402.30 A: but anyway it's it's very good that it's a good it's a good thought it's nice it is tempting but anyway it's ah 

398.09 400.58 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

402.45 411.89 A: it can be passed probably but i would just be curious is as to um e- what men would do i don't know like with the best friend of a guy 

409.46 410.43 B: yeah 

411.67 412.83 B: yeah 

412.23 419.48 A: what would they w- i don't know i this this has me curious well what well what women would think you know but 

415.52 416.92 B: [laughter] 

417.78 420.44 B: mhm no i definitely agree 

419.85 422.22 A: yeah but anyway it's 

421.52 426.72 B: well maybe after the the phone conversation they'll do ah they'll do a survey or something [laughter] 

426.05 430.47 A: what they'll they'll oh they leave you for comments don't they afterwards 

428.42 429.70 B: yeah 

429.84 433.45 B: may- maybe we can ask them to ah to make one [laughter] 

432.54 441.29 A: yeah they it it should because i i would be curious as to what ah what you know people realistically would do with that i thi- i don't know i think guys would 

441.34 443.23 A: sacrifice i don't know 

443.49 447.19 A: y- but then it might be surprising they might say women might do that too 

447.25 448.83 A: and stuff you know 

448.37 449.48 B: mhm 

449.03 452.65 A: ideas of grandeur and everything so um 

452.67 454.38 A: but you been doing this long 

454.56 458.79 B: the phone thing um no actually no this is only like my third or fourth 

455.15 456.25 A: yeah 

459.05 460.27 B: fourth call 

459.85 462.89 A: oh okay it's my i think it's my second 

462.32 466.01 B: oh is it it seem i mean at first it seemed too good to be true 

462.90 464.00 A: yeah 

466.06 470.84 B: you know it was like wow fifteen min- you know like fifteen minutes ten dollars i'm like hey not bad [laughter] 

466.06 466.98 A: i know 

470.32 472.46 A: i think it's actually ten minutes 

471.99 472.96 B: yeah 

472.64 476.28 A: i think it's actually and it's very good topics it's it's very very ah 

476.42 486.89 A: it's very very good to ah you know what what people think a lot of times it's it makes you never think of questions that when they ask you go wow like who you know what i mean 

483.73 484.62 B: yeah 

485.68 487.84 B: [laughter] 

486.98 493.70 A: because whoever devised the questions it's like you're on like a jeopardy or or like a wheel of fortune 

489.52 490.47 B: mhm 

493.15 494.93 B: yeah that is true that is 

494.05 497.06 A: you know and stuff like that but um it's pretty awesome 

496.69 497.68 B: yeah 

497.14 499.47 A: and stuff i guess we still have to talk 

499.44 501.28 B: it sounds like it [laughter] 

500.23 507.74 A: keep keep keep us going [laughter] but um anyway um what else let's see what else can we talk about 

501.81 503.09 B: [laughter] 

507.11 509.56 B: what else can we say about a million dollars 

508.90 510.53 A: (( oh yeah what else can we say )) 

510.68 512.43 A: they should make they should ah 

512.81 524.18 A: maybe they'll come up with something on one of the t._v. programs you know how they have like all these ah like hundred thousand dollar um pyramid or um what is it you know the t._v. shows where you can 

523.19 527.38 B: no you know what with with the luck that t._v.'s having now they're going to make a ah 

527.41 538.12 B: a reality show about winning a million dollars that's what they'll probably do they'll put like ten people in a house and see which ones de- decide to and then they'll follow them afterwards and see how much their life changed 

529.97 531.04 A: yeah 

537.64 539.97 A: yeah like you know like joe millionaire 

539.42 541.12 B: yeah yeah 

540.41 543.54 A: you know like something like that i mean it was um 

543.53 557.74 A: i mean at the end i think they gave both of them five hundred thousand but but still like um what they've been coming up with i'm well wouldn't be like i wouldn't be surprised everything is such a money thing look at the look at the show that's um fear factor 

546.26 547.31 B: mhm 

551.74 553.57 B: some of it is so pathetic 

557.29 558.35 B: yeah 

557.72 560.39 A: when they offer what fifty thousand dollars 

559.32 562.46 B: oh that i would not do that stuff for fifty grand oh 

562.06 565.98 A: the the in- the insanity of it is just is incredible 

565.36 569.46 B: yeah maybe one of the three stunts i'd do for fifty grand not all three [laughter] 

568.91 571.61 A: i know and that's not even a lot of money 

570.89 572.45 B: no it's not 

571.83 576.57 A: i mean they're not even saying oh okay we'll give you a million for you know you choose some ah 

576.90 587.58 A: you choose some ah roach [laughter] but like th- but people just think with the mo- money is is the ro- it's the root of all evil i mean they just think that oh 

578.72 579.65 B: yeah 

585.20 586.51 B: mhm 

587.54 599.95 A: this is going to be so wonderful i mean like isn't doesn't it's not going to cost any it's not going to matter what i do to get that it's you know people think money you know sometimes people do things for less money 

594.17 595.36 B: yeah
