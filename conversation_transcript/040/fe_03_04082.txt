18.63 22.10 B: [sigh] so do you have any experience with owning your own business 

21.73 34.88 A: actually no but i've always wanted to go into my own business and i was going to start like um a type of restaurant when we were younger mom always taught us how to bake and everything you know and i was thinking along those lines and i've done a little bit of baking and stuff for 

30.13 31.38 B: oh 

34.82 41.66 A: people you know just you know here and there and stuff and they all say i should go into my own restaurant business and stuff but 

41.28 42.79 B: (( well i just [sigh] )) 

41.42 51.65 A: i don't know maybe we have we have five little kids so [laughter] yes yes [laughter] 

44.77 48.09 B: yeah that one is very time consuming i hear 

48.61 53.51 B: to open your own business but i you know if money's not an object like they said [laughter] 

52.63 59.74 A: well that's i [laughter] right that's 

54.29 68.56 B: said you know it would definitely have to not be an object to try something like that i uh i've tried selling like clothing from my home party type and i'm not aggressive i don't do well contacting people 

62.29 63.94 A: [mn] oh okay 

68.03 69.65 A: oh 

68.56 70.55 B: and i'm not i'm not pushy 

70.36 71.48 A: (( oh okay )) 

71.05 76.53 B: so i don't know that i could open a business and be very good at spreading the word 

75.82 87.28 A: do you think though if you have i mean if you've proven yourself as far as by word of mouth and advertising that i mean you could you could make it work maybe i mean you'd 

81.38 82.38 B: uh-huh 

86.89 92.28 B: well i think you could you've already got a reputation out there as being a good 

90.65 91.84 A: oh 

92.22 102.74 A: right but i'm saying like with your clothes and stuff like that or whatever don't i mean you know if you started getting more and more people by word of mouth [noise] you know 

92.59 94.01 B: a good baker 

101.12 104.89 B: right a- and and getting people to have the the parties 

104.68 111.27 A: (( [noise] right [noise] oh [noise] )) 

105.06 109.12 B: you know to but and that's what i'm not good at doing i can't ask people 

109.21 122.17 B: to invite in you know ten other ladies i do have a l- a friend that is uh doing a lot of beautiful machine quilting in her home with a huge quilting machine and i would love to be able to 

111.19 121.39 A: (( right [noise] right [noise] [noise] oh )) 

122.38 126.59 B: if i had no- all the money in the world to set her up in business 

122.58 124.82 A: (( [noise] )) 

126.73 128.23 A: oh that would be 

126.74 132.05 B: and just be a silent partner because she's she's doing quite well 

131.60 132.83 A: [noise] wow 

132.50 138.86 B: and uh i i think i would do better as uh you know just a silent partner just doing the bookwork 

137.50 148.04 A: [noise] and [laughter] well that's a definite big part of the job though too you know as far as owning you know your own business and stuff you have to be on top of [laughter] that stuff too so [noise] 

146.41 153.42 B: well yeah that's the that's the only area of of owning a business that i feel i would be successful 

153.51 154.59 B: at 

153.56 155.30 A: (( yeah [noise] oh )) 

154.64 159.81 B: uh but gosh i encourage you to try if mom taught you 

156.74 165.13 A: [laughter] well well the thing is though like i say we we've got five little ones right now and um 

164.98 172.31 A: and uh it's just the timing's not right right now but you know maybe in a few years you know and if they get into school and stuff but 

169.83 171.33 B: well sure 

171.86 175.18 B: right when they're maybe even when they're grown 

172.41 174.04 A: i don't know 

174.72 176.11 A: (( [noise] right )) 

175.71 181.03 B: you know if you could do it uh to supplement a retirement or something to keep busy 

179.02 181.47 A: right right 

181.26 194.84 A: well we actually thought about not necessarily you know as far as your own business or whatever but um you know going into like a vending type of thing or whatever where we could do it during the summer where they're not in school and stuff and kinda make it a family affair you know that way but [noise] 

194.38 196.44 B: well that would be good for the children 

195.88 201.32 A: yeah i mean they'd they'd learn a good work ethic and whatnot [noise] you know that way so 

196.73 197.59 B: you know 

199.55 205.39 B: yes a good work ethic and they'd be learning something you know that you could pass on 

204.97 207.26 A: right right 

205.59 210.42 B: you know the baking skills and and so forth and who doesn't like baked goods 

207.65 216.01 A: right [noise] right exac- well that's the thing that you know when i bake now and stuff like that they always wanna be right in there and whatnot and 

215.80 222.91 A: you know helping out right away in the sebatso [laughter] right [noise] 

218.31 221.59 B: well that's that's good that they have that kind of interest 

221.72 231.97 B: i know that some uh i don't know the people but i have known of ladies uh that have started like a sandwich thing and gone around to businesses at noon 

230.38 231.91 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

232.00 234.28 A: that'd be kinda neat 

232.08 236.18 B: you know with sandwiches and i don't know if you know you could start 

236.43 241.63 B: something like that maybe on well gosh what could you do with pastries on weekends just uh 

237.82 238.78 A: oh 

241.59 255.80 A: well that's [laughter] yeah i know that's you know that's that's what i mean with with the restaurant type of stuff you almost have to get like i say you have to get a word of mouth out or whatever first and you know 

241.86 245.76 B: to get started you know stand in your front yard [laughter] 

255.73 270.66 A: go it that way but i don't know so [laughter] right well we we do like egg rolls and stuff now and people have been asking for those and 

255.73 256.84 B: right 

258.80 265.94 B: yeah well it's something you know you can definitely ponder it when the time is right you know the uh right avenue might open up for ya 

266.11 267.07 B: you know 

270.26 273.70 B: (( oh so it's not just pastry )) 

270.65 280.75 A: stuff so [laughter] no it's you know we can do we do all different types of things or whatever not we don't do a lot of it you know but like you know like when you cook for a 

280.64 289.84 A: a church function or a school function or something like that you know or boy scouts they're kinda all you know th- it it's been very receptive that way but [lipsmack] you know 

282.70 283.70 B: uh-huh 

284.32 285.25 B: uh-huh 

288.81 291.38 B: well then a a catering service 

290.97 294.95 A: right that would be kinda cool to do something like that but 

294.63 295.47 B: well 

294.71 307.53 A: i don't know [laughter] it's one thing it's one thing to say that you want to get into your own business but it's another thing to actually you know pull the trigger shall we say and actually jump into it to do it you know 

295.78 298.07 B: yeah but it would be 

303.41 304.41 B: well 

306.92 310.84 B: and and do it and then and have reliable employees 

310.18 322.30 A: right and that's that's one thing that i've noticed that and i'm sorry to say this but i am fairly young or whatever but you know the it seems like the work ethic of the younger generation is kinda not what it used to be 

321.85 324.97 B: i agree i agree totally i'm i- 

322.34 327.06 A: you know and and that's a big part of you know 

326.02 337.37 B: right right it seems like now i'm sixty four and i have grandchildren and i see you know the oldest grandson at nineteen h- has no motivation 

329.36 330.27 A: okay 

331.42 332.32 A: okay 

337.24 341.75 A: yeah yeah 

337.57 341.38 B: to work a- and do a good job but we have a little uh 

341.47 347.43 B: small little italian restaurant in the town where we live and they're it's run by some people from uh 

344.38 345.29 A: okay 

347.54 356.72 B: over round albania and they have wonderful work ethics but they have complained that the american youth they just can't hire 'em 

350.49 351.40 A: okay 

354.91 357.27 A: (( right no )) 

357.00 363.56 B: they will not show up they call in for no reason at all [laughter] to say they won't be in and i find that very sad 

360.10 361.90 A: yeah 

362.96 377.64 A: right and i think that's part of you know i i was a supervisor for a major company for eleven years and stuff and and i had to deal with some of these you know s- well i'll say the parents and i'm going geez if if they're that way i can imagine what type of kids and stuff they're 

363.71 364.79 B: (( you know that w- )) 

377.11 379.03 B: that's exactly right 

377.79 385.14 A: they're raising and i it's i'm i'm sorry to say that because it's like i like i say i am part of the younger generation and stuff i'm thirty four 

384.74 388.74 B: but you you've had better work ethics or better guidance probably 

385.23 386.42 A: and 

388.18 402.87 A: right and that's that's a lot of it it's i think today everyone wants to hand everything to their kids instead of making 'em work for it and i think that's kinda kinda leading to that problem as far as you know the the work ethic and all that stuff so 

401.98 412.82 B: right i i agree with you there and i find that parents make excuses rather than for their children rather than maybe side with the teacher or whoever they've been irresponsible with 

406.30 408.27 A: right 

412.11 415.13 A: definitely definitely 

412.86 415.92 B: you know and they don't they just see an easy way out 

415.43 417.01 A: right [sigh] 

416.09 420.08 B: and that doesn't do anything for the children in in their worth ek- ethics 

418.47 419.29 A: no 

419.76 430.30 A: no and the thing you know that that's only the one the one part of it as far as um um the work ethic or whatever but you know it's 

430.58 443.01 A: [mn] there's [mn] it just it just seems like i guess it all ties in but then i mean you know you have to be you have to be committed you have to put a lot of effort into the you know if you're gonna start your own business i mean you know you're probably working a lotta 

439.39 440.55 B: mhm 

440.79 441.87 B: mhm 

442.88 456.13 A: a lotta hours initially but but hopefully the reward comes later on in in the end where you see the fruits of your labor and stuff instead of just you know like somebody always told me they said you're never gonna get rich working for someone else 

444.77 446.00 B: oh yeah 

455.49 456.73 B: that's true 

456.04 468.47 A: and it's so true but at the same time i also have a friend that does own his own business and you know he he puts in you know at least sixteen hour days you know monday through saturday and and it it's a big time commitment you know so 

465.00 466.28 B: yes 

468.04 471.36 B: oh it is it is there's no doubt about that at all 

470.83 472.33 A: (( [noise] so )) 

471.41 475.29 B: you know that it's uh it would definitely take you away from the family 

474.87 476.73 A: right and that's 

476.09 478.47 B: and that's not fair to the kids right now 

477.86 489.75 A: no and that's the thing if you know if you can incorporate the kids into the business that way you know you could make it work that way you know where [laughter] right right 

485.63 486.94 B: (( your family time is actually )) 

488.38 490.64 B: (( helping run the business too you know but )) 

490.71 495.52 A: right you never know [laughter] 

490.78 504.59 B: so [noise] so well maybe it'll happen for you someday who knows who knows i it's not in my future i can tell you that [laughter] so i'll just stand back and wait to hear from you [laughter] what state are you in where are you 

496.03 505.73 A: [laughter] oh there we [laughter] uh i'm in minnesota 

505.08 507.14 B: you're in minnesota i'm in texas
