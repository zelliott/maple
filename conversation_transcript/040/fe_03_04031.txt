13.54 14.78 A: yeah 

14.18 15.40 B: (( oh okay )) 

15.53 24.53 B: well i've never ah had surgery but if it came down to it for a family member it would depend on who the family member is and what type of surgery it is 

22.51 23.40 A: mhm 

23.77 24.69 A: mhm 

24.89 26.21 A: not me 

26.41 27.11 B: you 

26.53 28.18 A: i would not do that 

27.58 31.84 B: you wouldn't do it like for any of your family members 

31.26 34.11 A: mhm mhm not if it's gonna get me in trouble

37.41 38.43 B: i would just 

37.89 39.53 A: maybe for my mom 

39.17 44.11 B: mhm then it also depends on the type of surgery and what risks are involved 

43.85 44.66 A: mhm 

44.46 47.02 B: but um i mean i i've never 

46.23 48.57 A: no sweetie it's not surgery it's perjury 

48.52 51.46 B: perjury oh i thought it was surgery 

49.15 50.33 A: yeah 

50.82 53.31 A: no perjury meaning that you would lie 

53.07 60.20 B: oh no no then i wouldn't oh okay couldn't hear clearly so if it was surgery that's why i'm like it all depends on the situation 

54.17 54.95 A: no 

56.45 58.50 A: [laughter] 

59.69 60.63 A: (( [cough] )) 

60.24 64.63 B: you know but um yeah i i wouldn't do that either 

64.29 64.98 A: (( no )) 

64.99 66.52 A: maybe for your mom 

66.26 67.72 B: mhm 

66.87 68.49 A: that's about it 

68.51 74.58 A: not anybody else 'cause otherwise you'd be in jail and jail is not a good place 

70.10 71.37 B: yeah 

72.49 73.60 B: yeah 

74.58 81.65 B: no absolutely not yeah i w- th- i i i didn't didn't i didn't understand the word but yeah that i i'm totally against um 

75.44 77.12 A: [laughter] 

79.51 80.44 A: yeah 

81.20 85.96 A: yeah i wouldn't want to be somebody's ah you know b. i. t. c. h. 

85.70 87.08 B: (( mhm )) 

86.03 87.66 A: in jail [laughter] 

87.40 90.85 B: yeah no i agree there [laughter] 

88.18 90.80 A: [laughter] 

92.09 96.59 B: but i i don't know who really would be up for doing that i mean 

95.87 110.58 A: well you never know you know there's a lot of people who would do it you know for ah the probably the same you know the same you know thing like what we were just saying you know maybe for you know a very close family member i mean for a mother sometimes you know for a brother or a sister 

106.88 108.72 B: mhm but you mean 

109.47 114.98 B: but to risk their life for s- i mean i- it's a different type of risk i think so 

113.89 115.42 A: (( yeah 'course it it )) 

115.34 116.48 B: mhm 

117.01 122.51 B: but i i don't know i i'm just i i would definitely not be up for that [laughter] 

121.15 122.25 A: [laughter] 

123.73 128.50 B: but i don't think i i i don't even know anyone who who would actually 

127.76 133.34 A: no ah neither do i actually i guess we've never had the real life situation so mhm 

132.53 138.69 B: yeah and i guess until you're put into that situation i mean that that's just depending on any type of situation 

134.73 135.81 A: mhm 

138.77 139.89 B: until you 

140.02 144.31 B: know you're standing in the other person's shoes you you really don't know 

142.25 143.35 A: (( that's right )) 

144.04 145.16 A: that's right 

144.53 152.14 B: and sometimes people just i guess it's it's they feel like they have to they'd had to without thinking about the consequences 

149.18 150.02 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

153.07 154.96 A: you're absolutely right about that 

154.84 155.83 B: so 

157.59 162.78 B: but [sigh] yeah i don't know i really never gave that much of a thought [laughter] 

162.75 163.31 A: (( [laughter] )) 

164.43 165.26 B: but 

164.66 170.17 A: well for the record listen to the ah people out there we wouldn't do it [laughter] 

168.78 170.56 B: mhm [laughter] 

170.86 172.21 B: yeah i mean 

171.17 173.01 A: because we don't want to go to jail 

172.64 175.55 B: no that that's a big thing and 

174.77 177.72 A: and ah also if ah 

178.12 182.58 A: we really wouldn't know because we were never because we have never been put into that situation 

181.97 183.33 B: mhm 

183.04 185.81 A: and then i guess it really just depends 

185.84 187.02 B: right and that 

186.19 189.09 A: and maybe if it was a mommy or 

188.51 194.25 B: i don't think i would even do it i mean i hate to say it even for like a family member like that because 

191.88 192.76 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

194.14 204.28 B: my it's just your life is basically over if you're in jail i mean i- it affects your whole future as far as a job or ah any any type of situation that 

198.10 199.20 A: (( yeah yeah you're right mhm )) 

205.05 212.61 B: it's such a negative regardless of what you did and i mean once you have that on your record that's a criminal record 

210.95 211.79 A: yeah 

212.02 214.42 A: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're right about that mm )) 

213.13 220.48 B: so there there's no turning back or there's no erasing it it's not like a credit report or anything that is a report for life 

220.13 222.05 A: (( yeah yeah that's true )) 

221.15 226.85 B: so i i don't even think i would do that you know for my mom or even my husband i hate to say it 

227.18 228.45 B: (( because i )) 

228.87 233.79 B: mean that is the only thing that you can't erase 

233.48 236.35 A: (( yeah hm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're right about that )) 

234.56 235.42 B: so 

236.57 240.67 B: (( but i don't know it's i never really thought of it 'cause i don't think i )) 

240.80 243.53 B: i hope i'm never in that situation [laughter] 

242.23 244.91 A: me either and god forbid knock on wood 

244.62 245.68 B: so 

246.12 249.12 B: but well what an interesting topic [laughter] 

248.04 248.81 A: yeah 

249.58 253.89 A: was it i was gonna ask another question is is this the first time you've participating in this thing 

253.40 255.69 B: no i've done one other one 

255.11 256.91 A: (( oh 'cause you have you gotten paid )) 

256.99 265.05 B: no actually that was a much more easier topic it was about friendship and i had a lot more to say [laughter] than this topic 'cause 

257.64 259.24 A: yeah i have i have 

261.97 263.77 A: [laughter] 

264.22 270.35 A: yeah what was it my other um what was that one first oh family was the ah topic 

269.18 270.43 B: okay 

271.11 277.53 B: yeah but this topic i i'm i i'd be wh- i'd be interested to find out if anyone would actually be 

276.84 278.55 A: yeah yeah well 

277.57 280.49 B: you know willing to do that for anyone 

280.88 284.38 B: but i don't know i'm not i'm not one of those um 

282.75 287.56 A: yeah well they don't i guess they don't disclose these things so [laughter] we'll never find out 

286.53 293.05 B: yeah now i'm just saying in general like who would even think like would consider doing that 

288.99 289.94 A: yeah 

291.25 293.19 A: (( well )) 

293.49 299.80 A: i'm sure you watch enough t._v. and and and i'm sure it it is done you know 

296.02 297.42 B: yeah 

300.58 301.56 A: because it's 

300.71 303.48 B: yeah no i'm sure it's done it's just 

302.17 310.15 A: because if people can dream it and and and think it it's happened in real life you know that's what i would say about t._v. 

306.53 309.46 B: mhm yeah that's true 

311.31 314.33 B: i don't know there's a lot of sickos out there [laughter] 

314.70 324.74 B: but yeah i mean that's all i really have to say about this topic is that i don't think i would ever do it because it would it would jeopardize my future my life 

320.68 321.49 A: (( yeah yeah mhm yeah )) 

324.93 330.15 B: and what lies ahead and and it's not worth it to do that for anyone 

327.45 328.26 A: (( yeah mm )) 

330.64 338.69 B: main focus is to protect myself and if that means you know that i can't do that for a family member or a friend or what have you then 

337.34 338.07 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

338.77 343.55 B: you know that that's fine and i would hope the other person would understand that 

344.11 345.14 B: (( and that's )) 

345.55 353.47 A: mhm well of course if it if ah that happened oh well then then and then they'll bring up the love card well if you love me you'll do it 

353.05 355.25 B: (( no well then i i was just gonna say you )) 

353.88 358.12 A: and you say well i don't want to go to jail thank you very much 

356.38 359.95 B: yeah but if they put that guilt trip on then they're not family 

359.45 360.31 A: right 

360.12 370.68 B: so i- if if that's the situation then i would definitely say no because they should understand the situation that i'm put in that that's not like asking a simple favor this is affecting my future 

363.45 364.33 A: (( yeah right )) 

369.08 371.93 A: no it's not no this is not a simple favor 

370.98 379.03 B: and what lies ahead of me that it's not worth it for anyone and i mean especially if they said that to me then i would be like listen then you're not who i thought you are 

373.99 374.86 A: right 

378.58 379.49 A: right 

379.23 380.06 B: so 

381.10 384.11 B: [sigh] but i mean it's it's not like you know 

384.19 389.60 B: it's another it's it's a completely different type of favor if someone were to ask that situation 

388.74 389.50 A: (( mm mm )) 

390.08 394.93 B: but i um i would never be willing to do that or sacrifice that for anyone 

396.91 397.88 B: but 

397.62 398.95 A: me either 

398.16 400.98 B: (( i don't know i just never really gave it )) 

399.90 403.27 A: [noise] whatever you said i say i i i agree 

402.88 404.27 B: mhm [laughter] 

405.32 406.58 B: but 

407.06 412.04 B: yeah i guess i mean that's pretty much sums up my my feeling on the topic 

410.85 411.71 A: yeah 

412.32 413.05 B: (( um )) 

412.35 414.19 A: i feel i feel the same way 

414.85 416.59 B: (( yeah well )) 

415.61 417.80 A: this is not a this is not a 

418.13 427.21 B: it's not like ah like you know like you can give in a little bit it's either all or nothing type of situation it's not like you can help the person half way 

423.41 425.65 A: yeah yeah yeah yeah you're right 

426.81 427.94 A: mhm 

427.32 434.80 B: and kind of protect yourself once you admit to it or you you commit that that's it there's no turning back 

432.60 433.44 A: right 

435.11 436.19 B: so 

436.46 439.75 B: i don't know i would never consider ever doing that 

441.46 442.85 B: but 

443.17 446.68 B: that basically sums up how i feel and there's no way i don't 

444.70 447.87 A: mhm [noise] yeah because i feel the same way 

448.05 453.56 B: know how much longer we have it's that ah how i feel i don't know how much more i can stress it
