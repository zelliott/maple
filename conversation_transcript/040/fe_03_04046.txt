72.71 73.53 B: even 

78.39 84.25 B: yeah definitely well i yeah i lived a year of my life outside of the u._s.

91.75 103.56 B: um and you know it's difficult to assimilate into a new culture so that's always challenging but [noise] man within like six months i loved it i never wanted to come back [laughter] 

104.74 111.37 B: [laughter] [noise] so where do you think you'd want to go if you could live out of the country 

111.88 114.30 A: oh can you still hear me okay 

114.17 115.36 B: yeah 

114.99 118.14 A: i i changed to the speakerphone thing um

118.72 119.76 A: i ah 

119.80 128.00 A: that's what that's harder um i've done a a lot of travelling but i i just don't ah it's a hard ah it's a hard thing i 

127.83 136.60 A: the one that's the closest to here that i've been at not that i necessarily want that but that's a comfort zone thing [noise] is new zealand 

135.73 138.69 B: oh wow 

138.34 139.11 A: (( so that )) 

139.19 141.56 A: that they're they're to me like 

141.49 142.83 B: [noise] 

141.89 154.79 A: three years behind us you know so and they'd love every american they they're they're more up on the sports than most people i know and you know what i mean so it's a it would be a real simple transition 

144.30 147.48 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

154.67 158.15 A: you know as far as culture you know 

158.17 159.84 B: yeah 

158.22 158.89 A: (( com- )) 

159.09 163.56 A: compared to going to you know spain [laughter] or something you know it's 

162.78 164.34 B: yeah 

164.04 167.19 A: it's ah you know they'll it's nice to have the language 

167.26 169.11 A: similar you know 

168.32 172.74 B: definitely that's that can be a real that can be a real stumbling block 

172.57 173.58 A: yeah 

172.83 175.06 B: you know [noise] 

173.86 177.26 A: so i liked i do the problem is i tend to like warmer 

177.38 190.65 A: warmer weather than a lot of places i like to go like you know i- ir- ireland and up you know england and that kind of place but they have you know it's just too chilly i'd rather have something warmer [laughter] 

187.79 189.38 B: (( [noise] )) 

190.32 192.72 B: yeah definitely me too 

192.68 205.15 B: but although i'll tell you i'm from michigan so moving out to california's been difficult because it's screwed up my whole winter i didn't you know i didn't have a chance to have winter it really screwed me up but 

199.55 200.96 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

201.11 201.79 A: [laughter] 

204.99 214.07 B: um so i think like i would love to um i think if i could live anywhere in the world i would definitely consider um south america 

214.11 218.73 B: or a spanish speaking country only because i speak lots of spanish so 

218.61 225.37 B: i think it would be nice plus i'd really like the rhythm of the culture in spanish um speaking countries 

225.18 237.40 B: ah i love the idea of a siesta in the middle of the day you know [laughter] i love the like laid back way of working you know but it's not that they're lazy it's just that they're taking 

237.95 247.76 B: they're taking their time to really um well i don't know when i lived in spain there was a saying they always use that was like do you work to live or do you live to work 

247.74 248.58 A: (( yup )) 

247.95 260.08 B: and it's and it's interesting because that whole idea is something that really affected [noise] me once i actually came back to america so i was um [noise] i was really excited about that 

260.22 269.51 B: and um i think the work ethic and the general family ethic that they have in um spanish speaking countries is something i find really attractive too 

270.66 271.65 B: (( but )) 

270.83 275.18 A: cool i have not ever been to south america so i don't know 

274.52 276.69 B: (( me either [laughter] )) 

276.47 281.18 A: [laughter] well what would you miss the most from here 

278.60 280.06 B: (( and )) 

282.16 284.62 B: (( um i would miss my family )) 

284.95 286.10 B: you know 

286.41 300.49 B: i love my family i'm really tight with you know my dad and my siblings and i think that would probably you know even moving this far away from them now has been hard [noise] just because 

300.73 315.51 B: you know it's such it's such a um pillar of your life i think and it's hard to really move away from something that you know it's like those are the people in your life that you know the best so [noise] and know you the best so i think that'd be the hardest 

313.73 314.66 A: (( that )) 

315.80 317.10 B: what about you 

317.32 322.97 A: yeah it it's the same thing it'd just be it'd just be the family and i guess it's also you know all the 

322.84 327.42 A: norms here you know it's ah you know i- i- i- it's comfortable 

327.24 341.01 A: because you know what's going on when you go some place else it's always surp- big surprises you know about oh man i didn't know they did that here you know [laughter] that kind of stuff but it's mostly family i'd you know i we have right now our 

341.00 349.93 A: you know i've got my daughter and our grandkids are living with now so that would be the hardest me [laughter] and one 

343.78 344.99 B: [noise] 

345.69 348.37 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] 

348.84 354.29 B: [cough] yeah but i mean if you had a million dollars i suppose you could relocate them too [laughter] 

354.04 359.06 A: actually that's what exactly they'd go with us if if at all possible [laughter] 

357.89 359.44 B: mhm 

359.24 360.14 A: so 

359.56 360.81 B: (( yeah )) 

360.20 370.59 A: right yeah that would that would be the that would be the thing but we just made a maj- you know a pretty major move away from our friends so i feel like we've you know sort of the we didn't go to a different country but 

370.42 380.12 A: you know you're still pulling up and leaving and going to a different area where you don't see your friends or call 'em on the phone very often or you know like we've moved forever away far away [laughter] 

376.17 377.98 B: yeah 

379.61 392.40 B: yeah that would definitely be hard that's hard and i sp- ah specially around holiday seasons that's where it really hits me especially thanksgiving 'cause that's the perfect time to get together with family and just pig out for no reason 

392.18 393.53 A: yeah it's true [laughter] 

392.82 398.02 B: so i mean i love it yeah but i you know i'll tell ya i think that 

398.04 405.83 B: you know if you know i don't know like everybody says you only got one life to live so live it you know and and i always think you know 

405.84 410.54 B: it's if you only have a certain amount of time to be on this earth then 

410.56 423.74 B: it seems silly that so many people don't have the opportunity to live abroad or just to experience something that's different from themselves and it's so it's it's yeah 

419.49 420.46 A: (( i ah agree )) 

420.62 424.46 A: totally especially there are so many people are saying oh 

423.80 424.39 B: (( [cough] )) 

424.37 437.32 A: sometime in my life i wanna go to paris or that's like a real common thing that people i've heard a you know a few people say and it's like just save your money i mean that's [laughter] 

428.98 430.42 B: mhm 

436.63 441.64 B: and it's not that expensive to fly out of the country these days it's not 

439.81 441.22 A: (( all it really is isn't it it )) 

441.27 451.27 A: it bugs me it's like is this a lifetime goal you know i mean all we do is we put a percentage away and and we're able to travel overseas every year it's no big deal but 

450.53 451.74 B: right 

451.67 465.61 A: we're disciplined to do that you know because we really really love to travel so if somebody has a lifetime goal it's like man even if you don't want to put the same percentage away put something you'll be going 

465.04 466.11 B: (( [noise] )) 

465.53 470.01 A: you know so anyway it it bothers me when people don't wanna 

470.52 477.59 A: you know reach for those dreams they just wanna wish only but they're not working toward it you know [laughter] 

476.35 483.21 B: yeah yeah well it's amazing because i think living out of the country also gives you an opportunity to see 

483.11 487.40 B: talents that you have that maybe you don't recognize here 

487.19 500.22 B: but that might be alter- like very valuable to other cultures [noise] and um you know and these when i when i've experienced um you know moments in other countries 

500.27 514.67 B: i always think to myself what an amazing cognitive stretch it is when you have to understand the language and you have to understand the way and there's so much and it's like you never think that you can stretch that far until you're actually there 

514.43 519.85 B: and you amaze yourself at the ability that we have as human beings to adapt 

520.05 526.81 B: to environments and languages and foods and travel that are so different than our own 

527.17 528.09 A: true 

527.34 530.46 B: and i i think it's just an amazing ah y- 

530.51 541.32 B: i don't know element of like human strength that we can d- w- that we are capable of doing that and i think of all the other you know people in countries who are refugees who come here 

541.09 553.19 B: and make lives and assimilate and come together and and you know make you know the cult- you know they've developed a richness for different cultures and it's wonderful 

553.46 562.17 B: i think ah you know that's definitely an opportunity i'd love to have in my life and the million dollars in my pocket wouldn't hurt [laughter] i'm where 

559.76 560.92 A: (( [laughter] it'd )) 

561.16 563.73 A: help g- wouldn't it [laughter] 

562.98 567.06 B: [laughter] 

564.33 573.76 A: that'd be fun 'cause well we lived in my my husband was in the service we lived in germany for nine months or whatever so we lived out of the country too which funny 

572.63 576.80 B: [noise] [noise] 

573.76 583.70 A: but um i've always felt when we've gone to some poor like carribean islands and stuff and i'm always going that l- ah talk thinking about oh there's so much business potential here in different 

583.69 587.26 A: you know areas and it's like you just feel like you're more 

587.04 599.89 A: more unlimited or something about what you could do it seems like it and i once they'll tell all the people that come here how they if they feel like that you know like i could be saying and that's why there's so many are so su- 

591.12 592.46 B: yeah 

597.43 598.38 B: [cough]
