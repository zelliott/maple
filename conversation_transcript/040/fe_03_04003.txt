94.92 96.43 A: they have to deal with it 

95.45 98.37 B: well it's the business of the person that they killed [mn] 

98.20 103.66 A: well in the end when they see god or the maker they'll they'll answer for it 

104.12 105.36 A: i don't have to 

105.81 107.54 A: speak up here

141.65 143.41 A: everything about it sucks 

143.67 155.06 A: people with money get away with anything they want and people without money have to go go into court without a lawyer and then they go into court and they get a poked defender that they've never seen before the day of their trial 

155.31 156.66 A: it's sickening 

157.97 164.34 B: i'm not disagreeing with that but i think trying to cheat the system is not helping the that's just making it worse [mn] 

165.25 168.33 A: when we all die we have to answer for our crimes 

168.06 171.15 B: [noise] well that's according to what religion you believe in [laughter] 

168.34 168.90 A: (( [noise] )) 

171.11 174.35 A: no that's that's if you just believe in a creator

185.36 186.81 A: oh yeah 

187.30 191.16 A: [mn] well i i believe you have to answer for your crimes in the afterlife 

192.01 193.97 A: and if you kill somebody that's 

194.23 196.68 A: [mn] that's something you're going to answer for i believe 

198.08 204.64 B: [noise] so you don't think you should real- you should answer for it at all in this life despite what cause pain you might have caused [noise] [mn] 

204.22 216.89 A: well if if the system was good if there was any good in a little bit in the system i i would i would believe in the system but the system's so corrupt right now it's a disgrace 

219.66 222.91 A: and i believe you don't ha- i don't i don't know i 

222.97 226.63 A: i believe you don't have to answer for nothing to these people 

227.04 229.40 A: judges or cops they're so corrupt 

230.11 232.84 B: so if one of your friends burgled a place 

232.80 234.03 A: burgled 

233.40 239.43 B: [noise] yeah or yeah whatever the verb is [noise] well same thing it depends on wh- what type of force you use [noise] 

235.21 236.60 A: robbed 

239.16 240.28 A: yeah 

239.67 240.74 B: um 

241.37 247.61 B: if they robbed a place that caused their robbing it caused the people to go out of business 

249.18 251.74 A: would- wouldn't they have insurance or something 

251.01 256.48 B: [noise] what if they didn't have enough insurance to co- what if they couldn't afford the insurance and what if they didn't have enough insurance to cover it 

256.24 259.12 A: i guess that's their their fault 

259.18 260.61 A: (( because people are go- [noise] )) 

259.97 267.69 B: or what if they couldn't wait for the ins- you know sometimes insurance takes months and months for it to actually come in and what if they couldn't afford to stay open as a result of that 

267.45 275.32 A: well if they find out who robbed them they should go they should go kill 'em they should be allowed to do whatever they want to whoever robbed 'em 

274.83 277.65 B: [noise] but i'm i'm asking about perjury [laughter] 

277.28 281.17 A: what are you what are you what are you asking about perjury would i lie for my friends or rob some- 

279.73 287.30 B: [noise] if you if you know that your friends who did that who basically caused them to go under as a result would you be wi- willing to lie for them on the stand [mn] 

286.76 287.75 A: yes 

287.89 289.04 A: no doubt [noise] 

290.04 292.26 A: i i i would give 'em an alibi 

291.13 297.28 B: [noise] but don't you think that that's a little bit hypocritical with religious beliefs of valuing one life over another 

295.90 298.15 A: i'm not really a religious person 

298.41 303.19 A: i just i just believe there's a creator and wh- at the end you'll go see him 

304.25 305.41 A: (( [mn] i don't know )) 

305.73 308.95 A: this con- i don't know this world's crazy 

311.05 314.00 B: [noise] yes though i i think that our system is very 

314.26 327.49 B: definitely very corrupt and messed up and everything but i think people not answering for things and also i think that [mn] not using models from other countries where they have a lot lower crime and [mn] a lot more trust for their fellow human beings as a result of that 

327.49 330.34 B: is kind of our most hypocritical [mn] 

330.14 332.08 A: (( what country are you talking about )) 

331.87 341.35 B: oh lot's of westernized countries including and even e- even when you look at some things like japan [mn] which you know has a huge population and it has like two murders a year [mn] 

341.48 343.10 A: [mn] oh yeah 

342.40 343.55 B: yeah 

344.64 349.69 A: [noise] i don't know i didn't know about that what kind of um government do they have in japan 

350.11 355.36 B: [noise] i can't i can't descri- you know it's just it's all based on [mn] a lot of it's based on trust 

355.89 358.49 B: and in a [noise] and ah you know 

356.09 357.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

360.53 364.08 B: and belief that you will do something fo- you know [noise] 

363.17 364.15 A: [noise] 

364.37 368.98 B: like i used to live in denmark and which is you know socialist and 

369.93 377.69 B: they they have vari- you know it's a country of five million people but you know we would never ever use that as an example but a city could use it as a model 

378.27 380.20 B: to where you should strive towards 

380.23 382.27 B: i mean they have like ten murders a year 

382.98 384.06 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

385.19 390.56 B: [noise] and they have very very low like recidivist rate like very low where people continue to 

391.04 393.43 B: to ah do the crimes after they've been 

393.58 395.12 B: put in jail you know

402.58 404.81 B: [mn] [noise] i mean the whole range [laughter] 

405.23 409.38 A: yeah i guess i guess there are a lot better countries 

410.21 423.33 A: [noise] but to go and testify against a person that you knew for a long time that you consider a close friend that- that's messed up i think 

416.61 417.59 B: right 

422.61 427.14 B: [noise] i think it depends on what they did because w- i don't know if i'd really want to consider someone a 

427.36 431.88 B: a close friend who would could pain someone to such a degree 

432.02 433.54 A: that would what 

432.83 435.58 B: [noise] who could pain someone to such a degree 

435.71 437.29 A: pain somebody 

436.68 439.40 B: yes who could put someone in so much pain 

439.02 440.75 A: oh pain oh [noise] 

439.82 440.72 B: yeah 

441.19 442.05 A: oh

445.21 446.98 A: (( yeah )) 

447.22 451.76 A: [noise] i don't know i i've seen the government do a lot of scumbag stuff 

451.56 454.33 B: i do too but it doesn't mean that i have to do it as well [laughter] 

454.54 458.61 A: yeah but i don't i don't need to be helping them in any way 

458.63 467.08 A: they they they have all the money in the world to prosecute people [noise] they should be able to re- put their case up without me 

467.39 470.07 B: well they don't have all the money in the world but but [mn] 

467.67 469.07 A: (( stabbing on my friend )) 

470.23 474.41 A: i don't need to stab my friend in the back for them to get their their kicks 

473.34 477.13 B: yeah but you're not just stabbing the government in the back you're stabbing the people that they hurt 

478.61 482.90 A: [noise] i don't know i real- i'm i'm not trying to look at their side [noise] 

482.92 487.76 A: i'm just looking at me and my friend and if he's my friend i 

486.78 490.03 B: i know but there- there's got to be some sense of empathy on your part 

490.26 491.44 A: sense of what 

491.09 492.49 B: of empathy 

492.16 495.53 A: empathy for the people that um were robbed or something 

494.90 495.77 B: (( yes )) 

496.03 497.27 A: nah there's none 

498.30 499.17 A: i don't 

498.41 501.26 B: well to me that's just as corrupt as what the government would do [noise] 

500.97 502.16 A: oh yeah 

501.58 506.46 B: yeah 'cause as soon as you forget how you're 

506.68 512.17 B: i mean the problem with our government is that we only think of we're very hypocritical and only think of ourselves 

512.48 515.87 B: and some of the success of other governments is being able to 

515.99 520.22 B: every decision you make affects a you know affecting other people [mn] 

520.67 523.15 B: thinking of yourself as a group rather than just a 

523.80 525.39 B: a singular motive 

525.49 533.02 A: [mn] [mn] well when you get governments involved that's where the corru- corruption comes see if we if we handled it ourselves 

533.06 540.79 A: [noise] there wouldn't be no problems [noise] like if somebody robbed you and y- you were allowed to go go and do whatever you want to to reprimand them 

541.01 543.45 A: i bet you nobody'd be [noise] robbing people any more 

544.83 552.22 A: [noise] you put child molesters on t._v. and whack and break their legs and then kill 'em i bet you there would be no more child molesters 

551.80 564.17 B: [mn] yeah but there's always going to be child molesters born and th- there's people are going to get away with it and if we have if we have i think the main problem with that is open communication [mn] and people not talking about the fact that they've been molested [laughter] 

564.20 568.58 A: yeah a lot of people are like that think they're ashamed or something 

567.96 571.73 B: and and we also put a lot of shame on the people who were molested 

572.03 574.08 B: so that they don't want to talk about it [mn] [noise] 

573.61 575.06 A: you think 

574.45 578.64 B: oh i think that's [mn] one of the most common things we do in this country [mn] 

578.82 580.92 A: i don't know how they i don't know 

581.34 584.90 A: that's that's a new idea i never thought of 

584.78 588.66 B: [noise] i mean that's why a lo- why a lot of rape victims never turn in their 

588.76 589.85 B: um 

591.05 595.78 B: never tur- never you know [mn] report that they've been raped because once they 

596.11 599.89 B: you know have to talk about it people bring up all the reasons why
