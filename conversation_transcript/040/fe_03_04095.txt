57.75 62.52 B: successful with it in that um i would be persistent with it there's a lotta different 

62.66 77.03 B: avenues and channels that you know a film production company could be successful and it doesn't necessarily mean it would have to be a uh a huge financial success it could be just a success on on the level of getting

78.38 79.35 A: mhm

85.48 86.11 A: (( mm )) 

86.45 88.63 A: [laughter] your initial thought 

88.93 90.66 A: all right um 

90.76 94.31 A: how did you choose a film company 

95.23 104.66 B: yeah that is um well my that's my background is in um as an actor and and actually in a screenwriter

105.07 107.16 B: and uh [sigh] so 

107.20 108.11 B: (( that's how )) 

108.18 108.94 B: (( yeah mm hm )) 

108.78 110.35 A: (( all right )) 

111.52 117.71 A: i think that i would open up a like a travel tour business if 

117.77 123.31 A: i had a choice and money weren't an object and i'm 

124.15 129.74 A: not sure exactly how i'd run it if i advertise try to get people interested and i'd like to 

129.86 131.13 A: tour 

131.33 146.13 A: i live in phoenix so and if people like to see the grand canyon or arizona sights i would take them and um i wouldn't be concerned about how s- how successful it is i just love to travel so i think it would be a great opportunity make some money and do what i enjoy doing 

144.98 147.95 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

150.14 152.59 A: so make to what you're saying you know this 

152.94 156.25 A: really it sounds like this is uh something you enjoy 

156.33 157.93 B: right 

156.47 158.00 A: certainly being an actor 

158.17 159.36 B: mhm 

159.39 162.46 B: yeah it's um the um 

163.87 173.17 B: [sigh] i think the [sigh] the thing that i would i would focus on and and is uh that also makes it enjoyable is is 

173.22 186.22 B: you know building getting a a group of people that uh have uh you know kinda the same vision and and that they would you know wanna be a part of it and and uh that they they would you know really have a desire to do 

186.07 195.12 B: just really good work and [sigh] and uh have a desire to ex- uh excel at doing good work um 

194.08 195.51 A: mhm 

196.02 197.51 B: and um 

198.68 207.52 B: people who are you know pretty uh not laid back in or s- like a slacker but just laid back and you know 

207.65 210.17 B: pretty easy going and not um 

211.22 212.44 B: um 

212.74 218.71 B: not a lotta attitude and and things like that to uh bring to the set and bring to 

218.97 224.98 B: the whole process so putting putting uh the work together i think it's um 

224.96 239.37 B: i was reading an article the other night about uh [sigh] a company- a guy who put together an independent film and that that's one of the things that he um he pointed out i think i i've i look for that but 

239.42 252.33 B: i didn't articulate it the way he had articulated it in his article was that he was looking he was putting together an independent film and what meant most to him was that he had people 

243.17 244.25 A: mhm 

252.52 266.09 B: who were there and they wanted to give you know like a hundred and twenty five percent and they had no attitude you know they just they wanted to do really really good work and they didn't have an attitude about it so you know and i think that's 

257.03 257.89 A: (( okay )) 

263.70 264.56 A: right 

265.18 267.64 A: so it made it easy to work with them 

267.11 270.06 B: yeah yeah 

270.14 272.22 B: yeah and um 

272.32 274.83 B: made it more enjoyable 

273.70 274.97 A: right 

277.04 283.00 B: so that's uh i think that would be one of the hows you know looking for um 

283.22 291.95 B: you know people who have the same vision and uh in terms of you know film production and you know people who wanna give 

292.12 296.84 B: a lot and and not have you know a lotta attitude 

296.02 297.80 A: mhm 

299.51 303.43 A: yeah that that sounds like it'd be interesting it's certainly something you enjoy 

303.44 306.54 B: (( yeah definitely definitely )) 

306.61 312.50 A: you know i think i would enjoy running my own business just the flexibility you know you can 

312.74 313.94 B: mhm 

313.29 320.91 A: work on it when you want and set your own hours and and then also r- really enjoy what you're doing 

321.15 325.65 A: not having to work for somebody else and my idea would combine 

326.21 327.06 A: (( um )) 

327.22 331.95 A: enjo- something i already enjoy travelling around and g- ge- 

332.01 338.31 A: get me up to maybe to travel and also meet other people and show them some of the 

338.56 352.19 A: the beautiful sites here in aria- arizona and you know the other thing that i'm good at is kind of the administration tasks so i'd certainly be involved in organizing the tours and 

352.52 363.35 A: getting people signed up for them and making sure that we have everything scheduled out people understand what the schedule is and that we're following the schedule for the tour 

362.78 365.22 B: mhm mhm 

364.13 365.49 A: and then also uh 

365.54 368.82 A: (( you know giving people a good time and stuff that they get to see )) 

369.22 373.40 A: some of the national beauty here in the state of arizona 

373.47 375.06 B: (( hm mhm mhm )) 

374.53 377.69 A: (( um and how i would run it )) 

378.04 379.93 A: i'm not sure probably we 

381.06 387.32 A: do a little little bit of advertising and and also word of mouth 

387.39 390.87 A: in smarted- starting off small 

390.89 392.87 A: a small group of people 

393.95 397.35 A: and then after you get going with the smaller group start 

397.73 400.20 A: running larger tours for people 

400.72 402.84 A: um then i'm 

402.85 405.45 A: not too w- worried about the success 

406.31 412.36 A: if money weren't weren't an object then i it wouldn't be an object to me it would be en- enjoying what i'm doing 

412.27 413.14 B: mhm 

415.26 420.40 B: mhm yeah that sounds sounds good the um 

422.84 424.68 B: the idea that um 

424.78 429.92 B: you know and and growing a business is i think it's an im- important 

430.24 439.52 B: point in that um you know the businesses don't have to like you know perception might be that a business has to be grown 

440.11 441.26 B: um 

441.53 442.87 B: and um 

444.07 455.15 B: might you know most a lo- i think a lot of people fail a business because they s- they step past some of the growth stages and they think that they need to be at the 

455.21 467.62 B: fully functioning stage and and there's a lot of smaller steps in between of of developing and and growing and and uh nurturing relationships with clients and and um business partners and things but um 

465.28 466.18 A: right 

466.57 469.16 A: but yeah some try to grow too fast 

470.33 476.21 A: and well the obvious thing that the reality sets in where if you're putting 

476.55 482.16 A: your efforts into this full time you still have to pay the bills so at some point 

478.95 481.60 B: (( mhm right )) 

482.52 490.15 A: the mortgage has to be paid and food has to be put on the table and if the business isn't making enough money to do that that's often the time when 

490.27 492.18 A: the small businesses will fail 

492.26 494.03 B: right 

494.15 499.92 B: absolutely yeah there needs to be and i think a good business plan 

499.89 503.10 B: would you know ahead of the game would actually 

503.01 515.12 B: look at that and you know and developing some kind of structure and some kind of you know financial um you know plan and and and gauging out well 

512.75 514.02 A: right 

515.81 527.14 B: at this point you know i [sigh] hope to have the business grown this much and and this is how much it will take and and this is how much income uh will take to support that and support me in the process 

527.40 531.65 B: um and to support other people if if um 

531.82 534.58 B: in fact i have employees working for me 

534.80 535.97 B: then 

536.37 550.09 B: you know a good business plan uh as you recognize would definitely look past or or be able to look down the line it's not one hundred percent but it you know be able to look down the line and and um 

550.02 554.62 B: and stay on top of um uh some of the financial pitfalls 

554.72 558.54 B: that uh starting a business can um 

559.08 560.90 B: can have 

559.92 561.43 A: right yeah i think i've 

561.62 564.63 A: a good business plan is key 

564.64 566.86 A: you know you can also put in 

567.02 571.61 A: some milestones and goals 

571.89 573.05 A: (( kinda give you uh )) 

573.26 578.45 A: something to measure against and you know by this point i'd like to be 

579.33 586.73 A: make break even and by a certain point making enough money to cover all the family bills 

586.65 587.41 B: mhm 

586.77 592.32 A: um and also give you a road map to try to follow um regard 

591.44 592.73 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

592.50 596.00 A: the business developing a good business mind is important 

596.02 597.51 B: yeah yeah 

597.98 599.89 B: yeah [sigh] i think that's probably
