170.59 184.25 B: [lipsmack] and like i said and we had to testify for the state of kansas one time several years ago and that was and the the thing was too i didn't know what my h- ah husband at that time was gonna say 'cause they took me in first and had me testify 

184.11 185.00 A: mhm 

184.39 187.68 B: and then they you know he couldn't hear what i was saying

216.03 218.05 B: mhm mhm 

217.27 221.26 A: i could see it was hard for him to remember what he said last time he told me 

220.15 223.05 B: [laughter] 

221.93 231.31 A: [laughter] he gradually you know it was so easy just to trip him up by just talking to him [laughter] you know it must be hard to remember everything you [laughter] you know 

224.96 227.53 B: mhm right right 

229.66 239.43 B: yeah yeah that that well that's what they say about lying you know when ah and and then that would be the same way with perjury if you go up there and right off the you know they ask you a question 

232.54 233.54 A: yeah 

233.66 234.95 A: (( it's easier mhm )) 

239.20 244.98 B: and you you even a little white lie well then maybe the next question they ask you 

245.38 256.01 B: is going to come back to that first one and you're gonna get you're gonna get flustered so how are you going you know you're gonna make yourself l- if y- if look stupid if nothing else [laughter]

460.87 461.72 B: and i g- 

463.30 464.90 B: i don't think so either mhm 

463.88 464.81 A: no
