1.03 2.07 B: (( hello )) 

1.21 2.78 A: [noise] [lipsmack] hi 

2.36 4.11 B: (( hi i'm rena )) 

4.01 5.94 A: i'm barb i'm from michigan 

5.99 8.34 B: i'm from florida [laughter] [laughter] 

7.43 8.54 A: ah [laughter] 

9.35 11.70 A: do you want to start the discussion or 

11.23 12.83 B: oh go ahead 

12.59 17.42 A: well i've thought of opening my own business i'm very interested in antiques 

17.69 21.23 A: but i live in a area that's extremely rural 

21.52 25.45 A: so i find that would be a big consideration as to what i would do 

21.86 22.42 B: (( [mn] )) 

25.70 26.61 B: uh-huh 

25.70 26.50 A: and you 

28.86 31.23 A: have you thought ever thought of opening a business 

31.57 33.90 B: well i haven't really 

34.11 40.58 B: thought of you know because money situation but they said if money's not a situation no problem 

40.74 45.10 B: i would open some sort of um 

46.09 47.87 B: pet place 

48.30 51.27 B: because i really enjoy pets 

51.76 58.13 A: more like uh [lipsmack] an animal store or uh [mn] or supplies for animals 

57.58 61.51 B: oh i would go ones that's with animals 

61.87 65.56 A: that would be interesting i it would be a lot of work because you'd have 

66.01 69.76 A: you know have to have someone there all the time i would think 

70.37 73.65 A: uh are you in an area that you think that would be successful 

74.00 75.20 B: well 

75.22 77.94 B: i am sort of in a rural 

77.95 79.32 B: area too 

79.53 80.77 B: so um 

81.04 87.72 B: but uh i'm not too far from the hustle bustle place you know i'm out enough 

87.79 88.94 B: but uh 

88.96 90.88 B: i i could uh 

91.11 95.47 B: drive to the you know a place like that and 

95.37 103.35 A: i would c- be concerned about being successful i couldn't open locally because i am extremely rural i'd have to be at least a 

103.37 104.53 A: thirty minute 

104.59 105.84 A: (( drive )) 

105.91 107.86 A: uh to the largest town 

107.90 110.32 A: and it tries to be 

110.33 111.71 A: a town that 

111.96 121.71 A: promotes tourism but it doesn't do a very good job of it it's it's not open on sundays and to me to be a tourist town you have to be open on sundays 

115.49 116.49 B: uh-huh 

121.34 122.32 B: uh-huh 

122.15 127.10 A: and so i would be concerned that i would have to do a lot of investigation before i really 

127.50 129.82 A: went into it i think i'd almost 

130.74 134.81 A: uh call [sigh] wh- what is it the small business administration 

134.67 135.58 B: uh-huh 

135.27 137.61 A: and and try to go that direction 

137.80 140.67 A: to maybe take some classes 

140.87 142.59 A: i don't know i'm 

143.20 151.54 A: [sigh] i'm older we took early retirements so it it's whether i would want to put the energy into it at this point 

146.47 147.70 B: oh uh-huh 

151.07 152.13 B: right 

152.25 157.18 A: i i like being retired at an early age and i'm not sure i want to go back to work [laughter] 

154.84 156.02 B: [laughter] 

156.72 157.68 B: right 

157.73 159.37 A: but that's you know 

158.12 161.89 B: but do you think do you think it would be the uh 

162.87 168.38 B: the more of the tourists that would be looking at antiques you'd get more 

168.34 179.59 A: i it i would think so um i go to antique stores but usually i do it when i go out of state i don't seem to find a lot in this area the ones that are in this area are more 

179.58 187.09 A: junk stores not the good antiques so i think i would almost have to do a tourist business to be successful at it 

181.01 182.03 B: uh-huh 

187.86 191.30 B: and you don't get a lot of tourists there 

189.96 196.04 A: well when you have the stores and no one has set hours and no one's ever open on sundays 

196.05 199.53 A: and um we have cruise ships on the lake 

199.62 202.40 A: and no one's open when they come in 

202.75 208.70 A: so it would be be hard to f- for me to find an area i would almost think i would have to relocate 

208.96 210.22 A: to do that 

210.14 211.09 B: uh-huh 

210.81 211.70 A: um 

211.74 215.79 A: which i would like to do but my husband doesn't want to so that's an- a whole 'nother matter 

215.45 217.12 B: [laughter] 

215.85 217.44 A: [laughter] 

217.55 218.47 B: right 

218.21 221.14 A: what about with the pet store if money was no object 

220.97 225.92 B: if the money were no object um it i don't know if it would be 

226.10 233.01 B: there's a fair you know amount already here but i mean well 

233.49 245.20 B: the area i'm in stretches you know for quite a ways and so i mean w- even with other shops and stuff out there i think 

245.41 248.05 B: (( that ah it would do okay )) 

248.05 250.81 A: [lipsmack] have you ever done anything in that line 

250.92 255.29 B: i have only worked in a veterinary clinic 

255.66 267.25 B: i have never done any other kind of pet thing you know i mean it's a little different from the vet clinic than it would [laughter] be from a pet store but 

267.03 269.02 A: have you ever done any retail work 

269.03 272.75 B: yeah i have i've i've done retail so 

271.84 274.25 A: i would think that would be helpful mhm 

273.39 278.40 B: yeah i've got the you know i got the experience and everything in that in that way 

278.75 279.94 B: (( but [sigh] [cough] [cough] )) 

280.97 283.57 B: ((  )) 

285.45 289.80 A: i don't i would think i would think educating myself would be the biggest 

289.95 291.42 A: thing i would need to do 

291.22 292.21 B: (( school so )) 

292.05 292.83 A: (( uh-huh )) 

293.52 296.79 A: (( [sigh] )) 

296.69 301.01 B: oh yeah [laughter] me too there [laughter] 

300.34 304.09 A: [laughter] i'm not sure that i would do well at going back but uh 

304.23 309.06 A: i would think antique stores in other parts of the country seem to do well 

309.14 313.56 A: there seems to be a craze of people following the antique road show type thing 

313.93 315.45 A: (( and )) 

315.10 320.54 B: [mn] so for like antiques and stuff you've gone out of town and out of state and everything or 

320.29 328.97 A: [mn] uh yes um my youngest child is very interested in antiques and got us going to the antique stores and to antique shows 

329.33 330.09 B: uh-huh 

329.44 332.86 A: and so and i've always had antiques in the house 

333.21 341.27 A: um years ago garage sale type things a lot of it are family things so i've developed an interest and i read a lot about things 

341.18 348.50 A: and i'm one of these people who if i read it i have all this useless trivia in my head because i remember things 

347.16 350.14 B: [laughter] uh-huh 

349.84 351.87 A: often thought i should go on a game show 

352.00 354.70 B: there you go [laughter] 

354.09 355.50 A: but it just 

355.62 361.68 A: it's not something i'd seriously thought about because i hadn't really thought of about going back to work i just at it 

361.79 364.33 A: you know this is hypothetical so 

363.76 365.30 B: hyp- yeah right 

365.19 368.69 A: uh it's not something i probably would pursue 

369.58 376.93 A: but it it is an interesting concept as to what you would do there are people who have dreams of opening businesses 

370.19 370.91 B: (( [mn] )) 

375.71 376.59 B: right 

377.89 381.82 B: if like money were no object type thing or whatever 

380.85 383.11 A: that would be nice wouldn't it [laughter] 

382.17 387.09 B: you know but i mean it is so it's not likely that i'd be [laughter] 

387.66 389.39 B: doing it so but 

390.01 395.04 B: it's something that i've always [mn] enjoyed it's is working with animals [mn] 

395.21 401.89 A: do you have a lot of animals yourself so you h- you know you said you'd worked with in a vet's office but do you have lot of odd animals yourself 

401.83 407.05 B: right now i only have a cat and bird and fish [laughter] 

407.76 410.35 A: well i would think you would need to be knowledgeable in 

410.86 413.00 A: in that area in to you know 

414.08 415.28 B: right 

414.91 418.44 A: uh knowing their needs and and their health and whatever 

417.99 428.66 B: yeah well i'd have to you know before i opened one up or something i'd have to have more you know [mn] educate [mn] on it but [sigh] 

431.15 436.09 B: you know also i'd try to educate myself more on it then open you know a place and stuff but 

433.02 433.90 A: well 

435.94 441.65 A: would working in a pet store give you an education i would wonder or an antique store 

442.13 444.83 A: as to what you needed to know when an 

444.92 453.36 B: it'll probably give you more yeah you know i mean you've got the general knowledge but it'll probably give you more of what you need you know 

454.08 457.66 B: to you know do something like that to have your own 

459.93 466.81 A: i w- for me it would be at the area i live in right now is that there's not a lot of uh rental property 

466.85 468.37 A: to put something in 

468.66 472.47 A: and that would also be a consideration i mean you wouldn't want 

472.65 476.17 A: i wouldn't think i would want to own the building i would want to rent it 

476.57 481.70 A: um but that seems ber- in our area that seems to be what the businesses do 

481.92 484.72 A: i mean even kmart doesn't own their own stores they 

484.18 485.62 B: (( [mn] [noise] right [laughter] )) 

485.06 486.15 A: they rent 

485.80 486.89 B: right 

487.87 490.77 B: yeah i think that would be the way to go too 

490.95 491.83 B: (( you know )) 

490.96 493.85 A: do you much about the small business administration 

493.94 495.75 A: i believe that's what it's called 

495.37 496.69 B: (( [mn] no )) 

496.27 500.78 A: it's through the government and i know they help help small businesses develop um 

501.11 505.19 A: plans to put their business into effect how to borrow money 

505.34 508.61 B: i've heard of it but i don't you know know [mn] 

509.62 510.54 B: (( you know )) 

510.62 513.53 B: i don't know how everything goes 

513.29 515.22 A: i would think that that would be something 

515.30 516.81 A: to look into 

517.06 518.01 B: right 

517.40 522.07 A: but i it would also think you would use a lawyer in some 

522.09 524.50 A: aspects to set your business up 

524.06 528.09 B: oh i'm sure yeah i'm sure you would need one like that too 

527.72 529.56 A: uh would it be something 

529.90 536.69 A: i would think i would only myself and husband be involved in it but would you be interested in doing it with a partner um 

536.84 540.79 A: [lipsmack] there's a lotta of aspects to this i hadn't thought about 

539.72 540.85 B: right 

541.93 545.31 B: yeah you wonder you know a part- you know a partner [laughter] 

545.49 547.07 B: if a partner ah 

546.80 559.84 A: well it it they're saying no [mn] money's no object but to the average person money is a is an object so that you would have to think of of your financing and whether you could finance opening a business on your own 

553.50 554.60 B: right 

559.77 562.60 A: to [mn] uh you have to establish credit to 

562.89 565.88 A: buy things for the store 

563.88 564.90 B: right 

566.35 567.69 A: (( and uh )) 

569.07 570.91 A: [lipsmack] i'm would sure that 

571.40 574.25 A: the small business administration could probably 

574.48 579.70 A: tell you wh- you know how to set that up i would think also the [mn] trade shows 

580.56 583.44 A: talk to people that are in the business 

580.61 581.53 B: uh-huh 

583.42 584.47 B: yeah 

584.62 586.03 A: would help too 

586.14 587.26 B: right 

587.30 592.96 A: i've [mn] i've been to antique shows and people are usually very [lipsmack] the people who are selling 

593.05 598.17 A: are usually very knowledgeable of of their products and are very willing to talk to you about what 

598.21 599.89 A: (( what they do and about their business ))
