27.75 28.96 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

28.86 36.40 B: i never thought about it but i think it'd be fun to open um an exercise business health spa 

36.52 39.89 B: 'cause where we're at there's nothing around us

44.64 45.71 A: okay 

46.06 48.13 A: yeah especially um

71.56 75.47 A: requirements building codes and so forth isn't it 

74.30 75.41 B: uh-huh 

75.75 78.43 A: so that that would be the only 

79.64 81.10 A: perhaps 

82.03 88.90 A: um perhaps difficulty but that could be dealt with very e- easily by hiring a 

89.29 90.62 A: a architect 

90.50 91.71 B: mhm 

91.10 92.80 A: right

153.95 162.74 A: well actually i'm um i'm in the process of beginning a new field uh in my speciality which is i'm a dentist 

162.40 163.47 B: uh-huh 

163.58 169.67 A: and um it's called psychiatric periodontics and i'm writing a book on that 

168.80 171.54 B: mhm that's interesting 

170.11 171.27 A: and 

171.70 172.75 A: um 

172.93 174.31 A: i basically 

174.44 179.86 A: look at the person as a whole as a whole person not just a tooth 

179.55 180.63 B: uh-huh 

181.16 187.44 A: and um you know i have all my training and my army and everything and i have all that 

187.67 188.66 A: um 

188.88 189.92 A: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

190.07 191.29 A: feel that 

192.70 197.22 A: that that dentistry as a profession has become very 

197.62 199.08 A: very um 

200.79 203.28 A: what is the word i'm searching for 

203.95 206.56 A: greedy not greedy 

205.30 205.86 B: (( [mn] )) 

206.65 208.90 A: er dentists have become very 

209.70 212.46 A: you know like a a trade 

212.27 213.47 B: mhm 

213.35 215.27 A: (( become like a trade )) 

216.24 220.84 A: and that's not why i went into uh the healing profession 

220.27 224.08 B: it's more for getting money and not to help the patient right 

222.17 223.76 A: [laughter] 

224.33 225.16 B: [laughter] 

224.43 226.79 A: oh yes forget money 

226.70 227.77 B: yeah 

227.15 231.38 A: if we forgot money there would be there would probably be oh 

231.58 235.62 A: only one percent of the doctors left and dentists left [mn] 

234.27 235.27 B: right 

235.27 249.86 B: i agree i go to a neurologist and just last just last month i went to her and she's in a partnership and she said she's been in one ever since she got out of medical school and she she went to a partnership 

238.26 239.73 A: yeah i've often 

246.53 247.80 A: she did what 

249.26 250.13 A: uh-huh 

250.22 255.08 B: and um well not really a partnership i guess she's working for another business 

254.70 256.03 A: (( oh who's this )) 

255.67 259.21 B: this is a neurologist that i go to i have m._s. 

259.19 260.92 A: oh 

259.97 266.70 B: and so she was telling me that's she's hated it ever since and she's always wanted to get out on her own because they always 

266.59 277.69 B: all they want is the money they don't care about the patient and she wants to treat the patient more so she was gonna go open her own business and she was scared to death 

268.92 269.89 A: yeah 

271.92 272.99 A: yeah 

276.33 277.53 A: yeah 

278.15 280.08 B: so i give her a lot of credit 

278.89 287.47 A: it's just a real it's a real crazy thing you know crazy thing you know [laughter] you call up a bank and you tell them that you're a professional and then 

282.80 283.99 B: mhm 

287.77 295.06 A: they start asking you um all these really really t- ridiculous questions so i- 

295.17 299.54 A: it is i've ch- i've noticed that there's a real barrier 

299.92 301.55 A: a real barrier 

301.69 309.18 A: for um a class barrier you know like a w- uh you have to be born in the wealthy class i believe too 

308.43 309.41 B: uh-huh 

309.58 315.30 A: in order to well in medicine it's a little bit different because 

315.33 317.88 A: you can go into a hospital 

318.11 324.60 A: and you don't have to worry about the state boards and that sort of thing which is 

322.09 323.33 B: right 

324.66 327.60 A: it's it's actually it's a little easier 

327.25 328.43 B: mhm 

327.72 329.71 A: but with dentistry 

329.85 343.55 A: you go into a state and you're gotta have five thousand dollars and a couple of patients lined up to yeah to take your boards and you've gotta be able to sit with two days with those patients 

336.36 337.60 B: oh really 

339.67 340.50 B: hm 

343.34 344.41 B: uh-huh 

343.89 347.35 A: and if they don't show up bam 

347.76 348.91 A: you lose 

349.29 351.74 B: huh i never have heard that before 

350.46 365.04 A: oh if they don't like the lesion they go well we just oh this is a little cavity over here but we don't like think the rest of the mouth is you know is up to par [laughter] and it's like oh 

362.78 363.93 B: mhm 

364.87 366.41 B: [laughter] 

365.70 367.32 A: yeah they can really 

367.92 369.42 A: [mn] it's political 

369.28 370.41 B: yeah 

369.83 375.42 A: i i recently wrote a little article about about it um 

375.72 382.48 A: because i happen to live in florida and if you're uh a dentist 

378.30 379.46 B: mhm 

382.58 385.10 A: and you happen to be from cuba 

385.53 389.66 A: you can go and get licensed the next day you swim onshore 

390.48 394.77 A: but if you're from m- from like um vermont like i am 

395.01 397.44 A: well you're just not good enough 

397.81 398.82 B: really 

398.73 400.96 A: yeah isn't that weird 

399.83 401.91 B: that's upsetting yes 

401.72 405.55 A: well there's something called the cuban mafia you know we have the 

405.83 407.96 A: miami mafia down here 

407.82 408.68 B: (( [laughter] )) 

408.97 411.23 A: [laughter] it's not very nice 

409.10 410.77 B: it's not funny is it 

411.24 412.17 B: [laughter] 

412.08 414.45 A: but what part of texas are you from 

414.31 416.44 B: uh the dallas fort worth area 

417.59 419.84 A: oh okay uh-huh 

419.08 421.55 B: it's right in the middle that metroplex 

420.41 424.58 A: so would you ha- would you open your business over there and 

423.77 427.66 B: we live in a small city and there's no health spas

440.77 449.87 B: but i don't know if i'd ever want to open my own business to tell you the truth but that just popped in my head just because of the area where i'm living
