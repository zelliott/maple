64.55 65.62 B: um 

65.68 72.09 B: well web design um m- most of that's done through the internet um so you wouldn't really have a storefront 

71.60 72.47 A: uh-huh 

72.06 81.94 B: um but you would um notify people and make contacts um through business organizations and um meetings that type of thing 

82.28 87.84 B: um the biggest obstacle to me is sales because i'm not good at sales i'm good at designing but not sales 

87.12 88.80 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] so you do have like some web 

89.15 91.23 A: web design experience and everything 

91.10 92.32 B: yes 

92.05 97.51 A: oh that's kinda neat [noise] but there like a certain type that you'd be most interested in [sigh] 

93.57 94.42 B: but 

97.07 100.14 B: no any type i just like to be creative and um 

100.37 101.21 B: um 

101.87 106.07 B: you know find out what the clients want and then gear it towards what they want 

105.11 106.88 A: uh-huh that's something 

107.66 116.68 A: [mn] that's something i'd love to know how to do and i can never get into like the h._t._m._l. i haven't been able to really figure it out is it something you had to go to school for or 

113.84 114.78 B: yeah 

116.42 124.74 B: yes yeah h._t._m._l. you have to take classes in it and but really most of the time you don't use h._t._m._l. all the time you use other tools 

124.09 124.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

124.61 133.46 B: and then you have to revert back to h._t._m._l. to do some of the work but um a lot of it can be done through different tools that er make it a lot faster and easier 

126.86 128.03 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

133.05 134.46 A: (( uh-huh so it's that's )) 

133.72 135.41 B: more graphically 

135.10 135.78 A: (( [sigh] )) 

135.43 137.21 B: graphic type of tools 

136.55 146.23 A: what's like the average time that it takes to do design like a webpage like just your basic you know not one that would be for a major business you know real indepth but 

140.75 141.70 B: (( uh )) 

145.71 150.17 B: yeah just depends depends on the number of pages and how detailed but um 

150.30 154.99 B: you know i would say a week or two uh for a s- a simple a simple one 

154.03 154.84 A: uh-huh 

155.39 158.23 A: that kinda nice then you could just do that right out of home and 

157.62 169.29 B: yeah that's why i would like to start that type of business so i could work from home and set my own hours because my husband works um unusual hours and th- that would be good for me because i could work those same hours with him 

159.78 161.04 A: yeah that would be 

169.40 170.16 A: uh-huh 

169.46 173.70 B: and you know work on people's things uh you know in the middle of the night when i'm up huh 

174.18 176.25 A: that would that would be great 

175.87 176.83 B: yes 

177.34 178.48 A: (( um [sigh] )) 

178.82 180.86 A: (( trying to think what else [laughter] [sigh] )) 

180.20 181.84 B: [laughter] 

181.37 182.57 A: it's kinda hard [sigh] 

182.87 183.86 A: (( um )) 

185.50 190.20 A: well how you said you went to college for it is this something you'd have to go to ccollege for 

189.71 197.64 B: oh well no i had um uh some classes in it from my previous job um they signed you know me i had classes that i took that that 

194.12 194.91 A: uh-huh 

196.80 201.15 A: [noise] so it's not like like an eighteen month program or anything like that wow 

200.37 204.67 B: helped me right it was just you know specific cl- classes on h._t._m._l. 

205.38 209.13 B: and it lasted for like three days each class 

207.80 208.57 A: uh-huh 

211.09 213.30 A: what about as far as um 

214.44 221.84 A: well you said about the sales and all that how would you go about that would you have to like do an advertise on a website or would it be like business to business calls 

219.85 227.80 B: yeah you do a lot of advertising yeah you can't do you know just send out emails because you know people really get offended by that the 

226.23 234.67 A: right but i mean would would you have to would you be more interested in like calling like your local companies trying to do that way or would you try and do it more a web based [noise] mhm [noise] 

234.16 245.11 B: um [lipsmack] a lot of times i look at people's websites and if i feel that they could need improvement i send them an email saying you know s- making some suggestions on how it could be improved 

245.23 248.18 B: and sometimes i get a response back and sometimes i don't 

252.12 252.78 A: (( uh )) 

253.21 254.14 A: um 

257.12 259.60 A: boy what a subject for them to pick offhand you 

259.13 269.03 B: [laughter] so g- getting back to your crafts um [lipsmack] what would be the first thing you would do to s- uh set up your store what um 

269.39 275.62 B: would you buy materials would you have classes for people to come in and do craft and or 

274.81 275.73 A: (( know [noise] )) 

275.76 278.30 A: [mn] [noise] what i'd like to do is at first go out and 

278.74 283.88 A: and buy all my materials and make you know make all of my own um 

284.07 287.47 A: so that [mn] before i open have a lot of stock already on hand to 

287.35 288.28 B: mhm 

287.54 300.56 A: make a a pretty good variety of things and then maybe later on bring in some things for people that like on consignment for them and then i think it would be great uh to do some actual hands on classes that teach people how to 

301.57 303.86 A: to make some of the crafts and stuff 

303.56 310.37 B: yeah i think they'd be a a big ah need for that how would you go about letting people know about the that would you advertise or 

306.48 308.24 A: [noise] 

310.12 316.32 A: [noise] yeah you'd have to advertise probably in the paper and just word of mouth big signs everywhere [noise] and flyers [noise] 

316.77 318.24 B: and um 

318.72 320.18 B: what obstacles 

320.46 324.52 B: other than money because uh you know [mn] you money is not an object is this 

323.89 326.80 A: [noise] a five year old son [laughter] 

324.63 328.74 B: case study [laughter] oh wh- what other obstacles 

327.37 335.07 A: he's an obstacle on phone calls he's an [laughter] that's right he's my main obstacle is just trying to find the time that 

330.04 331.17 B: [laughter] 

332.12 333.33 B: (( is it )) 

335.29 337.81 A: to ha- actually make the crafts 

337.96 341.99 A: you know and and have the alone time without having to be interrupted constant- 

342.57 347.25 A: you know it it's hard to when you're doing something like that you're cutting or you know anything with 

347.40 350.28 A: hot glue guns and things like that i wouldn't want him around 

350.10 351.69 B: yeah 

350.74 352.12 A: where he could get burned 

352.13 357.75 B: yeah so you would want to do this so you could work from home and have your children in the house too 

355.42 358.97 A: (( and yeah i think it would be great to work from home )) 

359.07 360.96 A: um or mayb- you know 

361.12 369.43 A: maybe have the shop but [sigh] and be open during the day and have family or something help but f- for the most part work from home especially making all the stuff 

369.08 370.08 B: mhm 

370.44 374.64 A: so that i could still be around the family and not have to leave for long periods of time 

374.72 377.79 B: so would you hire employees then to 

377.81 380.17 B: uh take care of the shop while you weren't there 

381.06 387.89 A: [noise] [noise] yes [noise] i think that'd be you know that'd be the nicest thing since like they said money wouldn't be an issue um 

387.92 394.44 A: then you could you know you could kinda give back to the community then [noise] if you could hire somebody to help you instead of having to run it all yourself 

394.20 395.24 B: mhm 

395.19 397.88 A: then you could you know give somebody else a job and 

398.55 400.33 A: [mn] help everybody that way you know 

403.06 409.48 A: and and especially then like i said if later on you could do consignment things too and sell a little bit for everyone 

410.49 412.44 B: where people would make their own mm 

411.92 421.47 A: yeah yes and we could um a lot of shops around here what they do is they'll take stuff in on consignment [noise] so ah i know like in our area the big thing right now 

421.49 423.07 A: is 

423.23 427.23 A: the teddy bears people are dipping 'em in wax in the scented waxes 

427.07 427.84 B: hm 

427.56 429.29 A: those are really popular 

429.21 429.91 B: hm 

429.57 440.68 A: and i know um one of our local s- craft stores right now they're taking 'em in on consignment and so the you know the person will go out and they'll [noise] buy all the materials and they're make that item 

440.74 442.66 A: they'll take it to the craft store 

442.76 446.06 A: and the craft store will sell it for 'em for say twenty percent 

446.19 453.48 A: so if you know you have five dollars in it and you wanna double your money for ten you know the craft store will probably want to sell it for thirteen [noise] for ya 

453.29 454.24 B: oh okay 

454.02 457.14 A: so that they make a little bit and you also make what you want 

456.82 462.92 B: so is it a uh a certain percentage or is it set up based up on individually by by the project 

462.40 469.17 A: [sigh] i know around our area [noise] most of 'em are on a percentage [noise] and they do take twenty percent i've seen as high as thirty 

467.50 469.83 B: okay twenty percent mm 

469.60 471.73 A: but twenty seems to be the average 

471.52 472.94 B: that sounds reasonable 

472.55 481.73 A: yeah it's not really bad and i i mean everybody in you know in that aspect [noise] everybody makes a little bit on it you know you're getting in especially if you enjoy making it to begin with 

478.15 479.03 B: mhm 

484.58 495.19 B: a lot of um crafts are labor intensive um so you put a lot of time in for the the profit margin have you considered you know how that would affect it right 

494.34 496.48 A: yeah that's that's the one thing 

496.71 511.13 A: [noise] that i know you have to stick with something that would be really simple and wouldn't take you a lot of time otherwise it just wouldn't really be worth your while [noise] you know if you enjoyed doing making [noise] that particular craft than it might help you know [noise] a little bit but [lipsmack] 

511.44 512.86 A: (( i know um )) 

513.75 522.75 A: [lipsmack] some of the stuff my husband and i used to do craft shows once in a while and some of the stuff it was just uh the amount of time you put into it for what you could sell it for it wasn't really 

522.91 525.00 A: worth your while it wasn't feasible 

526.54 533.00 A: [noise] but if you could find something that you could get your materials cheap it would be quick to make but still look great 

532.86 533.65 B: (( mhm )) 

533.37 534.39 A: that'd be you know 

533.92 543.45 B: or sometimes when you do several at a time you can keep your costs down because you buy in quantity and plus you do kind of production type thing or something where 

537.92 538.95 A: mhm 

542.13 551.33 A: uh-huh yeah and i know like [mn] there for a while we'd do uh uh the most fun thing i ever did was for the kids at school for their santa's workshop 

552.03 554.58 A: and so we'd make crafts for 

554.90 558.34 A: kids to buy for their parents and everything and then it was just 

558.76 571.16 A: i didn't care how much time i put in because you knew some little kids out there thinking he's really buying something for his mom and dad and you know and so you'd you'd make it as cheap as you could but yet if it took me extra long time to make it i didn't care 

564.45 565.54 B: yeah 

570.91 571.73 B: hm 

571.65 576.38 A: you know and and those were the most fun because we would kind of set up 

576.40 587.36 A: my husband would do one part of it it was like an assembly line then i'd put on you know do this aspect of it and my mom was good at painting so she'd paint the faces and you know you could w- do along that line too 

587.79 588.65 B: yeah 

587.86 589.94 A: kind of get the whole family involved 

594.45 597.01 A: [noise] [mn] have you done any crafting or 

596.93 599.89 B: ah not really i do enjoy crafts but i really haven't
