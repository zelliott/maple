0.59 1.91 A: (( hello )) 

1.80 2.88 B: hi 

3.09 4.12 B: i'm robyn 

3.29 4.20 A: hi m- 

4.36 5.68 A: (( i'm elaine )) 

5.57 6.70 B: hi elaine 

7.18 8.81 A: so perjury 

8.43 12.15 B: yeah would we or would i ever commit it for a 

12.25 13.78 B: (( friend or family [laughter] )) 

12.61 15.86 A: would we be willing to do it on a friend's 

15.99 18.92 A: i wouldn't basically because one 

19.36 25.98 A: i don't lie and two i would not want to suffer the consequences if it were found out that i were lying [laughter] 

25.95 31.90 B: right well yeah for definitely for a friend i i would really say no 

32.21 35.23 B: i th- i mean because friends i mean 

36.16 42.73 B: friends are a little more removed family it it makes it a little harder we got to figure out some how to talk for ten minutes on this so [laughter] 

42.24 46.09 A: oh right depending on what the nature of the case was 

43.74 44.28 B: (( ah )) 

45.46 49.43 B: yeah um but you know i mean but but friends i mean 

46.19 47.65 A: like whether they were being 

50.08 54.22 B: friends you know friends are good and sometimes friends are better than family but ah 

54.51 55.51 B: um 

55.60 58.64 B: i couldn't see doing it for a friend [laughter] and i 

58.75 64.51 B: probably wouldn't do it for a family member either 'cause most people i mean if they did something wrong i 

65.44 72.39 B: mean that's what we're assuming yeah [laughter] if they do something wrong then i guess they have to take pay the consequences for it i w- i'd lead a 

67.12 68.29 A: right then 

71.01 73.71 A: exactly exactly 

72.53 81.19 B: i lead a pretty str- straight life and [laughter] and the things i do wrong i i end up having to pay consequences for but um 

82.37 87.25 B: so how do we talk for eight more minutes [laughter] on this [laughter] [laughter] 

84.62 90.85 A: well [laughter] well let's see we could look at it from the aspect of 

91.27 95.11 A: okay would we be willing to do it um do they want us to discuss 

95.32 98.99 A: ah potential situations on what it 

99.74 100.56 A: [sigh] 

100.76 108.48 A: like like for example as i said if the person were wrongfully accused but the evidence was overwhelming but you knew that they were innocent 

108.13 110.32 B: ah oh okay that's a good one 

108.71 115.99 A: you know you'd be hard you'd be hard pressed to come to their behalf when you knew that the district attorney was trying to 

116.55 118.16 A: you know set them up 

117.90 119.05 B: right 

118.17 123.06 A: just looking looking for a ver- a guilty verdict regardless of what the truth is in the situation 

123.92 129.30 B: yeah i'll bet let's see but if you knew the truth then you could say either 

125.91 126.76 A: so 

130.23 138.03 B: honestly put them somewhere out you know take them put them out of the s- crime scene you know they were at my house that would be the truth or 

138.05 139.26 A: right 

138.08 139.35 B: but i guess if you 

139.48 141.13 B: (( i'm just trying to hm )) 

141.80 142.91 A: it's um 

143.60 152.65 A: it's just a matter of you know whether you you're gonna go with moral absolutes or whether [laughter] you're gonna do right or wrong based on 

153.13 155.62 A: the given circumstances [laughter] 

155.43 163.82 B: yeah well yeah and then you get into the whole thing well oh yeah lets take something simple let's say somebody was doing drugs or something you know something that's 

164.50 168.02 B: you know not necessarily a huge crime to society it's more of a per- 

166.59 171.16 A: or like like a high school student someone had stashed drugs in their locker 

171.13 172.14 B: right 

171.43 174.59 A: and they were innocent but and let's say it was your child 

174.24 175.39 B: okay 

175.13 184.41 A: and and you know your child's never done drugs and you trust them implicitly and they're like i do not know how it got there but all the evidence is pointing to them i mean as a parent 

184.54 186.95 A: that would be really tough [laughter] 

186.82 200.69 B: right but then you wouldn't be having to commit perjury bec- but let's say you knew your kid used to do drugs say let's say he did drugs for two years and stopped and he hasn't touched them since and you know that and then the d._a. asks you you know or whoever 

200.97 202.67 A: oh if they ever had 

201.48 204.01 B: did your kid ever do drugs 

204.04 208.10 B: and i- you know there's no record of it anywhere you know this was all in your house you know 

204.38 205.32 A: yeah 

207.78 209.28 A: oh 

208.30 209.32 B: did you 

209.39 213.19 B: because then you know if you said yes then 

213.30 216.26 B: you know they'd go wow maybe he's doing 'em now 

216.44 222.37 A: [lipsmack] but you know i'd have to look at the big picture and know that your children are looking at you as an example 

216.78 218.23 B: but [laughter] 

221.86 223.35 B: well that's true 

223.28 227.11 A: and and so in that instance it's it's hard 

227.61 232.70 A: i i mean i just i just would have to believe that in the end the good is going to come out of the situation ah ah 

232.93 244.21 A: i mean i mean i'm optimistic that way [laughter] so i mean i would be embarassed in front of my child you know to s- to stand in front of my child and lie when they look at me knowing that i'm lying 

235.31 236.76 B: right right 

242.13 243.37 B: right 

244.08 244.97 B: (( yeah i'm )) 

244.77 246.08 A: so 

245.17 249.32 B: just trying to think of a situ- you know trying to come up with some situations that 

250.91 257.95 A: well you know what the sad thing is is in the news and and television you never hear about the consequences of committing perjury 

257.76 258.99 B: (( well i know )) 

257.90 268.34 A: i mean it's it's like this you know do you swear to tell the whole truth you know [laughter] but i i very rarely ever hear anything about someone's gonna go to jail you know someone's gonna pay a fine 

266.60 267.95 B: well yeah then we're 

268.34 271.29 B: didn't we have a president who did that 

270.83 274.31 A: ah well that's another topic [laughter] 

272.87 277.32 B: (( [laughter] ah i know that's another topic but he committed perjury [laughter] )) 

276.42 281.53 A: exactly well oh and which one would that be [laughter] 

280.10 282.99 B: oh i don't know [laughter] guess there were two of 'em 

281.71 291.92 A: what's that well okay let's see there was the one about um well how about i did not have sex with that girl how about that one [laughter] 

288.57 289.48 B: yeah 

290.49 293.68 B: (( how do you define sex [laughter] pervert but )) 

292.77 295.10 A: (( there you go i mean )) 

295.23 305.07 B: yeah well you're yeah that's bad [laughter] but i think nixon had something too for what i understand [laughter] but that was a little i was pretty young then [laughter] 

304.64 313.13 A: [laughter] oh well next we're gonna go to bush's with no new taxes huh [laughter] that's the former president bu- yeah 

305.39 306.14 B: (( ah )) 

309.40 311.32 B: yeah exactly and 

312.53 315.23 B: yeah then we don't have any ah 

316.05 317.44 B: new i don't know 

317.63 324.21 B: we just spend how many b- b- zillion dollars on a war and then they're you have to cut taxes by that much too [laughter] 

323.94 326.68 A: how many phone calls do we receive in this program 

324.43 325.25 B: oh well 

326.56 328.27 B: i think it's supposed to be three 

328.23 331.88 A: three and then you're not able to participate after that point 

329.16 330.02 B: yeah 

331.70 333.86 B: i don't know how that works after 

334.01 338.20 B: i mean i don't know you it probably depends on if they need more more ah 

339.55 341.61 B: you know more subjects and that 

341.87 349.35 B: what i think's weird is that they're having us discuss a topic which we should we need probably should get back to [laughter] the real problem too 

347.96 349.44 A: hm the topic what 

349.38 356.79 B: we probably should get back to our topic but but you know they have topics that i don't think that's even what this is about it's all about language and sound [laughter] 

351.47 352.57 A: oh yeah 

356.40 359.78 A: yeah like what accents or choice of words 

359.32 361.79 B: i i don't know they're maybe just 

360.37 363.09 A: based on our educational background or 

362.11 363.22 B: (( [laughter] )) 

363.24 366.17 B: i yeah i don't know it it's curious 

363.48 364.82 A: who knows what 

364.99 370.72 A: oh perjury they needed to give us more to chew on than that [laughter] you know because well 

368.13 372.01 B: i know yes no [laughter] 

371.28 375.95 A: ah yeah it pretty much was it's i i'm not willing to do it i mean 

376.04 384.04 A: um if we're talking about my my husband is going to go is is going to go to the guillotine is gonna go to the electric chair 

384.29 388.22 A: you know and i know he's innocent and i'm trying to save his life then 

388.23 391.62 A: i guess i would have to be in that situation you know what i mean 

391.49 398.57 B: yeah well but if you know he's innocent then chance but but it's perjury to you would be lying you know like if he 

391.87 393.05 A: it'd it'd be 

399.34 409.29 B: may have murdered somebody and you don't know where he was that night but you don't think he murdered the you know [laughter] this person but you don't know where he was then that would saying um 

405.29 406.50 A: right 

409.59 414.02 B: i mean he was at home in bed with me all night long [laughter] 

410.15 410.87 A: but 

413.22 419.52 A: right when when and and and i'm a hundred percent certain that i know who committed the murder 

414.26 415.30 B: and 

419.40 420.42 B: right 

419.55 426.97 A: you know and yet all the evidence is pointing to my husband well my we do get the topics don't we [laughter] 

422.87 423.78 B: yeah 

425.79 430.52 B: yeah well i mean so now there you know it's like you know he's innocent but 

430.78 435.60 B: you'd be lying if you said yeah he was sitting right here with me all night you know 

435.29 437.86 A: but i would feel powerless to dissent him 

435.82 436.55 B: and 

437.79 438.96 B: yeah 

438.08 448.40 A: even though even though i know he's been falsely accused [lipsmack] yeah and when you talk about family now did it say a friend it did say a friend it didn't say a friend or a family member did it though 

445.28 447.01 B: yeah it said it said 

448.10 452.42 B: it it said friend or family so the the yeah yeah 

448.62 449.57 A: it just 

450.15 459.55 A: oh did it say friends or family okay well it's kinda hard to differentiate friends and family 'cause if you're just talking about blood relatives you can have a friend that's closer than a brother you know 

452.82 453.66 B: (( i could )) 

458.85 460.66 B: well exactly 

460.74 461.61 B: but 

461.11 462.00 A: so 

461.75 474.07 B: you'd be a little less tied into i guess a friend even though they are as close because like if you were talking about your husband you know there's half your support or all your support [laughter] going to jail [laughter] you know 

474.16 474.84 A: (( [sigh] )) 

474.68 478.41 B: or being you know so i guess that i'd probably be a little 

478.94 489.48 B: it wouldn't be as much of a um moral dilemma um it wouldn't be as yeah wouldn't be so hard to make the decision if it was a friend it's like well sorry buddy [laughter] sorry buddy [laughter] 

489.81 491.38 B: i'm not gonna lie for you 

489.89 495.58 A: [lipsmack] well i was just i would want i'd want truth i'd want the truth to come out 

491.55 492.55 B: but i wouldn't 

495.54 496.51 B: yeah 

495.62 509.63 A: you know a- a- [laughter] it's it's really hard you know if you're if you're on the stand and you're given yes no questions or or even open questions where but you want to say this and you want to say that and you're not allowed to speak 

509.73 513.66 B: right you answer the question [laughter] answer the question don't 

509.89 510.75 A: (( truly )) 

513.88 515.27 B: i know i ah 

516.19 517.04 B: (( i mean )) 

517.30 526.43 B: yeah i just can't imagine lying on the stand well 'cause i like you said i wouldn't want to go to jail or whatever happens to people who perjure themselves i mean 

526.50 539.49 A: [noise] and i don't think um [lipsmack] i don't think the consequences are well known because like we said we know of instances where people did perjure and i think in the instance of clinton i didn't he get a hefty fine 

539.86 543.00 B: maybe i guess that wouldn't be i mean [laughter] 

542.35 548.54 A: i i believe he got a big fat fine which for him probably is just like a slap on the wrist but um 

543.71 545.24 B: right right 

547.33 550.30 B: right yeah yeah maybe that's 

549.08 558.06 A: most of us probably know p- most of us p- probably know are more likely to know what we're gonna pay for a speeding ticket or for a parking ticket but we don't know what the consequences are for p- 

554.13 555.47 B: [laughter] 

558.18 559.20 A: perjuring 

558.91 571.86 B: yeah but i can't imagine if you're you know us on the street if we perjured i don't the fine would be i mean if it if his was a huge amount of money i doubt ours would be as hugh you know we probably had to have been thrown in jail [laughter] 

571.47 577.84 A: yeah but then we could go to the whole o._j. thing where if you're not a celebrity the consequences are a lot more grave 

574.48 575.19 B: [laughter] 

577.49 579.35 B: yeah exactly 

578.47 582.23 A: so so who knows i mean you could be made an example of 

582.13 583.86 B: that's true [laughter] 

582.62 586.60 A: and i guess it depends ah whether there's a lot of publicity behind the case 

586.31 592.10 B: yeah that would be my luck you know i'd be made an example they'd hang me in the street or something [laughter] 

591.18 592.52 A: [laughter] 

592.34 596.74 B: put me in a stock and you know [laughter] have people throw tomatoes at me 

594.38 595.48 A: yeah 

596.65 599.95 A: you'd you'd wear the the scarlet p. instead of the scar-
