5.85 7.49 B: um atlanta georgia 

7.17 12.88 A: hi i'm in cincinnati ohio and we're having a terrible thunderstorm at the moment [laughter] 

10.83 17.13 B: oh i'm sorry we've had our share the past week but today is bright sunny and pretty 

16.59 22.12 A: oh it's ah horrible here and the lightening and thunder are so bad i hope it won't affect the telephone call 

18.47 19.32 B: (( oh )) 

21.79 24.10 B: oh i know well 

23.32 24.66 A: (( [sigh] )) 

24.13 33.99 B: hopefully it won't last too long well [lipsmack] myself i would not commit perjury for anyone because i'm too afraid that they would find me out and then i would be in jail probably [laughter] 

31.96 34.88 A: [laughter] you would be instead of them 

34.70 36.52 B: [laughter] 

35.37 44.02 A: [laughter] yeah i don't know i've thought about that at t- you know like when i watch t._v. shows and somebody does it you know because of a child or a spouse or somebody and 

39.28 41.12 B: (( yeah [noise] mhm )) 

42.97 44.26 B: mhm 

44.45 46.48 A: you know i don't think i would 

46.04 47.28 B: mhm 

46.50 47.43 A: but 

47.87 48.87 A: (( you know )) 

47.92 53.36 B: yeah yeah i i guess it would depend on the circumstances and and what it was and everything 

52.67 55.59 A: yeah there you know it just seems like i 

55.78 61.13 A: i i guess i c- i'm not i can't be one hundred percent you know sure 

59.90 62.28 B: mhm mhm 

61.49 64.27 A: without knowing what the situation is 

63.75 64.98 B: mhm 

64.34 67.59 A: but i would like to think that i would not tell a lie 

67.12 69.39 B: right 

67.76 69.01 A: but 

70.26 73.72 B: i would like to think that too and um 

73.96 84.55 B: i don't know i i think a lot of people have done it and have been found out and sometimes the consequences are a lot worse than they think that they would be so 

84.85 86.36 B: i just 

86.43 89.70 B: find it hard to think that i would be able to do it and 

89.84 91.47 B: without being found out 

91.05 97.11 A: mhm so you you wouldn't you would not tell a lie not for the moral 

91.68 92.72 B: mhm 

97.35 99.23 A: not because of 

100.16 111.08 B: well yeah because it's morally wrong and also because i i think that the consequences for me would be so much greater because it it's usually worked that way in the past so [laughter] i think i learned my lesson 

100.22 100.97 A: the 

111.39 113.11 A: uh-huh so um 

115.37 116.76 A: and i guess ah [lipsmack] 

117.34 120.08 A: boy i i don't know i would just i ah 

120.14 130.59 A: you know just off the top of my head i would say the same thing but then think well i'm sure there are situations out there that i have never been faced with and 

123.14 124.29 B: mhm 

129.34 130.41 B: mhm 

130.54 138.57 A: so i i can't say you know black or white one way or the other that that's definitely what i would do i'm sure there are some grey areas in there 

131.78 132.76 B: (( no )) 

138.79 139.94 A: but um 

140.21 141.58 A: something might 

141.59 143.13 A: might change my mind 

143.03 144.21 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

144.62 152.83 B: i guess um the situa- it depends on the situation and ah that particular case and everything has you know a lot of bearing on it but um 

145.90 146.51 A: (( i )) 

152.46 155.55 A: no i hope i never am faced with that situation [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] 

153.82 157.63 B: i know i know i know everybody you know 

157.81 163.55 B: and i'm sure it would be really hard especially if it was a family member or a friend you know 

163.98 165.39 B: that you um 

165.60 169.21 B: [lipsmack] who's case probably depended on you know 

169.36 175.36 B: your telling the truth or lying for them and it would be a hard situation for anybody to be faced with 

176.72 182.43 A: yeah i think of my kids and you know what i would do for them but i 

178.38 179.49 B: mhm 

180.89 181.84 B: mhm 

182.83 185.04 A: don't even think i'd like to set the 

185.29 189.17 A: example that i wouldn't be completely honest 

187.34 188.40 B: mhm 

189.00 190.22 B: (( mhm right )) 

189.97 190.82 A: either 

191.10 191.91 B: (( yup )) 

192.25 203.35 B: i mean sometimes kids put you in awkward situations and they'll did you hear about that um girl whose family had taken her on a cruise and she wanted to get back to her boyfriend so she wrote some 

203.47 213.60 B: terrorist like notes and well she wanted it to b- appear that way but they found out that it was her i think her family was from from california and [lipsmack] they 

212.70 215.70 A: oh was this the cruise that was out in hawaii a few weeks ago 

214.99 216.67 B: yeah yeah 

215.99 221.57 A: oh i never heard wh- i just knew that that they had found the notes but i didn't hear anything about the the situation 

221.04 223.87 B: so they locked her up and her mother said that 

223.86 236.06 B: she was gonna have to just work it out herself because you know she had no right to do that and that was so awful [lipsmack] she just wanted to come back to be with her boyfriend from the cruise quicker mhm 

233.49 235.11 A: (( oh dear )) 

235.76 241.93 A: oh yeah [lipsmack] there i don't think i would [lipsmack] ah i think i would do the same thing that mother did okay 

241.04 243.51 B: me too she has to learn her lesson 

243.13 244.70 A: (( oh yeah definitely [noise] )) 

243.80 257.91 B: it's gonna be some tough love there because eventually the mother is really gonna start to feel bad but she needs to stick to her guns and teach that girl a lesson 'cause she was like twenty i mean she's not a baby and if she didn't really want to go on the cruise she should have just stayed home 

245.52 246.57 A: (( mm )) 

258.39 264.75 A: well i guess it wasn't a situa- i mean i guess the mother wasn't really asked to to lie anyway i guess it was you know 

264.22 276.88 B: no she wasn't asked to lie mhm she just was asked um [lipsmack] what they were just saying you know um what how did she feel about it and she said that her daughter they were not going to put up any bail and her daughter would just have to um suffer the consequences 

276.65 277.49 A: (( hm [lipsmack] )) 

279.83 284.93 A: no i i i'm that's interesting because i hadn't heard any more about that story 

284.55 287.68 B: mhm i think i s- read it in the paper or something 

287.91 288.70 B: but 

288.74 293.03 B: strange things are happening every day i tell you worse and worse 

293.55 302.22 A: well i love to watch the crime shows on t._v. law and order and the practice and and those kind of ones and you know very often they'll have somebody who lies 

297.19 298.73 B: mhm mhm 

299.13 300.74 B: yeah they're very interesting 

301.82 302.88 B: mhm 

302.69 306.11 A: [lipsmack] and ah of course you know that's all 

306.34 310.07 A: fiction anyway but ah you know they're always found out 

307.27 308.27 B: yeah 

309.72 310.54 B: yeah 

310.86 311.88 B: mhm 

313.69 324.23 B: yeah 'cause usually when you tell one lie you have to tell another one and then you start forgetting you know which one is which and that's what i think would happen to me so i would you know [laughter] 

324.07 336.06 B: eventually you would be tripped up and then they'll go well i thought you said so and so and so then you go you know you try to cover that one and you know it's just um a vicious wave you'll start to weave when you start to lie 

335.86 346.37 A: [lipsmack] yeah well you i ah [lipsmack] when my kids my son was about three or four he had this little friend who just lied all the time and and he was just always being found out 

342.93 344.11 B: mm 

344.96 345.56 B: (( mm )) 

345.79 347.11 B: mhm 

346.38 348.04 A: you know a- and 

348.47 351.87 A: it just got to the point where nobody ever believed anything he said 

351.37 357.36 B: yeah i can imagine i wonder if his parents lied or he had to get that from somebody 

352.14 353.20 A: (( but ah )) 

356.70 358.64 A: you you'd think so 

357.99 359.40 B: mhm 

359.53 360.14 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

361.90 370.61 A: i i i really i i don't know but i i know that my kids were always saying you know chuck said such and such but you know that's not true and and i- 

367.90 368.84 B: mhm 

369.26 370.58 B: mhm 

371.19 374.69 A: they they understood you know that it wasn't the right thing to do 

372.75 373.76 B: yeah 

374.38 375.50 B: mhm 

375.62 377.30 B: well that's good that they did
