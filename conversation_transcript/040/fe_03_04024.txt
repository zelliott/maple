0.07 1.96 A: hi this is dee 

1.16 2.67 B: hi i'm jane 

2.49 3.24 A: hi 

4.93 6.19 A: [noise] 

5.15 7.61 B: um um i guess i wouldn't i mean 

7.71 13.10 B: if you got yourself into hot water friend or no friend it's their responsibility to be responsible for whatever they do 

13.16 15.38 A: yeah that's probably the same way i feel [noise] 

16.72 19.10 B: i mean if they were doing something the shouldn't have been doing 

19.33 26.72 B: they should have known that that they shouldn't be doing it and i don't know i don't want to lie for myself but i don't know that i would lie for anybody else either 

20.61 21.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

25.99 30.07 A: [noise] [noise] what if it was your son or your family member [noise] 

29.75 30.60 B: um 

30.73 31.51 A: [noise] 

31.55 35.07 B: i mean if they're talking perjury as before the law you know what i'm saying 

34.02 34.79 A: [noise] 

34.80 36.03 A: (( mhm )) 

35.23 44.49 B: you know if if they've done something that bad that they're in court for it you know whether it's custody or anything like that you would think that [noise] you know 

37.24 38.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

44.86 48.25 B: i don't know i guess i think that's the it should be no because 

48.42 52.26 B: [noise] um i mean i love my son and all but i don't know that 

52.57 57.76 B: that's gonna teach him anything and and really help the situation 'cause you're not teaching him anything if you're 

54.53 55.30 A: [noise] 

57.85 63.99 B: you know if you lie out of your way out of it you know you're telling him that's all right and [noise] we all know that it's not 

62.97 65.71 A: [noise] [noise] yeah it wouldn't really be teaching 'em nothing [noise] 

65.11 70.55 B: nope and actually you'd probably get yourself in more trouble because then he's gonna think that it is okay i mean 

67.46 68.57 A: [noise] 

69.53 70.42 A: yeah 

70.72 73.93 B: so i don't know i guess for me i don't think that that um 

75.01 77.71 B: really solves anything so i i would say no 

77.91 80.31 B: how about you how about you're family members 

78.48 79.28 A: yeah 

79.75 84.33 A: no i don't think i would either [noise] i don't think i would 

82.07 83.61 B: i mean there's so much stuff 

83.74 85.64 B: going on um 

85.78 90.02 B: right now i don't you know in the world i don't know that [cough] 

87.63 88.50 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

90.22 94.44 B: that would be a very smart thing to do on anybody's part but [noise] 

93.32 95.55 A: no but i bet you people do it all the time 

95.19 97.17 B: oh i'm sure i'm sure they do 

97.27 98.83 B: have you done this before 

97.57 98.54 A: [noise] 

98.67 101.75 A: the fisher study yeah i've done a few of them 

99.45 100.47 B: yeah 

102.91 105.60 A: (( [noise] ah this is probably my fourth one i think )) 

104.76 107.14 B: [noise] yup okay this is my second 

105.97 107.81 A: [noise] second [cough] 

107.20 111.93 B: yeah but i think you know [noise] some of the stuff they've encompassed is kind of creative i guess 

108.27 109.33 A: [noise] 

112.18 115.91 A: yeah some of 'em are easy some of 'em are a little more intense i guess 

117.00 125.54 B: yeah i don't know i don't i just don't think that [noise] it's just the right thing you know ah although i do imagine that depending on the situation everything is different you know what i mean 

117.64 119.15 A: [noise] 

124.57 126.62 A: yeah you know anybody that ever has 

126.70 127.82 B: i'm sorry 

127.18 131.33 A: do you know anybody that ever ever has [noise] committed it 

129.37 131.19 B: um that has no 

131.80 133.50 B: i don't know a lot of people that have been 

133.90 136.98 B: in that situation and that have been you know 

137.11 140.15 B: in court you know what i mean i don't [noise] 

138.44 140.76 A: [noise] mhm where are you from 

140.52 141.76 B: minnesota 

141.24 143.05 A: minnesota i'm in pennsylvania 

142.09 142.84 B: um 

143.26 147.07 B: i don't think that i mean i don't know i mean i'm sure that there are 

146.22 147.41 A: (( [noise] )) 

147.81 153.62 B: maybe there is somebody i don't know i don't know anybody that you know spends a lot of time in a court room which is probably a good thing 

153.37 159.97 A: no i think i probably know some that might have can't be sure but [noise] they may have for their families [noise] 

158.29 165.32 B: yeah i don't think they advertise that you know what i think you know it the situation well you know i was talking about custody or something like that i know 

165.56 168.51 B: um that it gets a little dicey you know 

166.67 169.48 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

168.57 182.80 B: and that's ah you know if that's what you you know what they'd be talking about yeah i mean 'cause that that would be perjury if you said you know so and so was home all the time and you know they're were a good parent and that you know you might think that they might be a good parent but you know 

171.59 174.57 A: you mean child custody or something like that yeah [noise] 

181.70 190.46 A: [noise] [noise] yeah there's a lot of ways you could do that for perjury though just about [noise] a lot of things that'd be said or done [noise] 

188.97 190.50 B: [noise] and i just think that would be 

190.64 193.36 B: you know i think that would probably be harder 

193.53 201.28 B: you know what i mean if you thought that this person would be a good parent or you know maybe they had a you know an incident or something that is hanging over their head and somebody's pushing it 

196.24 196.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

199.48 201.02 A: [noise] yeah 'cause in one 

201.08 205.04 A: [noise] one person's eyes it might be they're a good parent and the other person's eyes they may not be 

204.89 206.39 B: right 

205.78 208.07 A: so it would be kinda hard too to say and 

209.30 215.85 A: i don't know what how a court would decide if you really did perjury or not because what if that was how you felt but it wasn't the truth 

215.73 216.66 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

216.03 218.19 A: (( you know in something like that that kinda )) 

217.77 220.55 B: [noise] you know i'm not just talking about you know 

220.85 223.41 B: did he steal the money or didn't he i mean you know 

221.35 221.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

223.68 226.30 B: then there's the matter of proving it 

225.13 231.94 A: what's i think on the thing when we signed up for these surveys it said if it was like a family member or your best friend 

231.63 232.48 B: uh-huh 

232.26 233.52 A: i think that's what 

233.59 235.28 A: they're sort of basing that on 

235.76 238.80 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i i i just really don't know that i couldn't 

235.80 236.85 A: whether it 

237.92 239.50 A: [noise] 

238.92 243.22 B: knowingly knowingly [noise] say something was true like that 

243.59 251.35 B: and and know that it it wasn't you know what i mean and lie about it i don't know that i could do that um because [cough] i mean [noise] 

244.02 244.59 A: (( mm )) 

245.38 247.63 A: [noise] mhm [noise] 

251.61 256.69 B: depending on it certainly could easily come back to you you know and you know 

256.71 258.57 B: if you're talking about a little kid 

257.05 258.14 A: [noise] 

259.06 263.41 B: i don't know i think it it's just hard i mean yeah you want what's best for the child if that was if that's 

263.51 266.99 B: truly the case you want what's best for the child but 

264.49 265.09 A: mm 

266.61 274.76 A: [noise] well say you if you had a child and then they did something that wasn't even really that bad but they could go to prison of jail or whatever and ah 

275.32 279.43 A: thing for [noise] the rest of their lives until they're say thirty years old or something 

279.58 280.73 A: (( [noise] then would you )) 

281.07 283.72 B: (( [noise] i don't know if i could live with myself if i did though )) 

281.46 288.41 A: [noise] [noise] it would be your own [noise] it'd be your own child you be sending away when you know what they did wasn't that bad 

287.74 289.62 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

289.74 292.59 B: but still i guess i'd just keep for going back for but 

290.39 291.42 A: [noise] 

292.49 295.95 A: [noise] like say maybe he just stole a car or something [noise] [noise] 

296.23 300.74 A: and nobody got hurt or nothing and something like that maybe they're talking about 

298.08 299.51 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

300.20 301.74 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

301.75 311.05 B: i'm sure that could be the case but i still don't know that i would feel comfortable saying that ah he didn't do something or lying about something that he could or could of not have done 

305.40 306.60 A: [noise] 

309.28 309.97 A: [noise] 

310.56 312.03 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

311.85 316.42 B: you know because i mean if he if he stole a car say for instance i mean 

312.47 316.81 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] well let's say it was your car )) 

316.67 322.47 B: right but if he still took it and he didn't have permission i mean obviously i called the police you know 

318.98 320.25 A: (( [noise] but the )) 

322.02 324.02 A: you would call them on your own son 

323.49 326.45 B: if if i though it needed to be done yeah i mean 

324.79 327.08 A: [noise] really [noise] 

326.99 331.41 B: [noise] i guess it really would depend on the situation that encompasses it you know what i mean 

329.26 331.57 A: (( [noise] it's )) 

331.55 332.74 B: if 

332.15 334.52 A: a hard choice to call i guess 

333.47 340.68 B: if i had a if my son went and [noise] and took the car i mean my brother took the my last car with out permission before 

337.56 338.13 A: [noise] 

339.32 341.95 A: [noise] mhm 

340.69 342.18 B: and you know 

342.22 344.31 B: but [sigh] see 

344.37 351.72 B: they knew where i where the car was it wasn't like they didn't know then they knew where he was going 'cause they had told him he couldn't go there and you know so i think it 

348.13 349.23 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

349.31 350.72 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

352.25 353.79 B: (( [noise] but i ha- know )) 

353.84 358.48 B: of people and i have friends who have called the police on their own kid because 

358.49 359.93 B: (( something needed )) 

360.56 366.87 B: to to tell them that this isn't gonna go on this way you can't continue this way 'cause you're gonna get yourself in trouble you know 

366.83 377.86 A: okay well say then he took it to go give a friend a ride to the hospital because something bad happened like it was for a good reason that he took it without permission [noise] and then he got in trouble for just driving 

374.46 375.89 B: (( right )) 

378.74 379.95 A: then would you do it 

379.75 381.83 B: [noise] [noise] would i call the cops 

381.34 382.60 A: would you ah 

383.02 384.86 A: testif- you know against him 

383.47 390.63 B: i wouldn't say that he i would tell the truth i would say that he took it [noise] for a good reason you know he didn't have permission but i would you know 

390.63 391.93 A: well that's true 

392.16 394.31 B: i don't know i mean it it'd be really 

394.80 397.40 B: man it's a hard thing i mean you know i guess 

395.90 396.76 A: yeah 

397.42 400.25 B: ah at first i thought it was kinda more cut and dried but [sigh] 

400.61 402.01 B: i think that there are 

400.79 403.56 A: yeah the more you think about it the more you get into it [noise] 

403.23 407.57 B: yeah i think that there are issues that could come up where it could be very 

408.16 412.92 B: hard to put yourself into a position like that i mean you know 

411.28 412.04 A: [noise] 

413.65 421.73 B: [noise] i guess in the most part i think i'm a pretty honest person [noise] things are pretty much black or white i don't do a whole lot of grey area [noise] 

415.43 416.01 A: (( [cough] )) 

418.86 423.74 A: [noise] [noise] yeah most people gotta pay for what they do so ah [noise] yeah 

421.97 425.10 B: and they should i mean you know 'cause most of the time 

425.35 432.83 B: they know what they're doing isn't right [noise] but they continue to do it because they either haven't gotten caught or haven't been forced to pay for what they've done 

432.85 436.73 A: unless it is a child that's the only they wouldn't really realize it 

434.38 435.32 B: right 

436.82 438.05 B: but 

438.37 441.11 B: (( you know i mean it's kinda one of those things what's it )) 

441.71 453.61 B: what's it worth to you you know what i mean i ah pay me now or pay me later that's kinda the way i've always handled stuff like that and then if you don't [noise] you let it slide now and they figure they can get away with it without 

443.01 443.84 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

453.02 453.95 A: (( [noise] )) 

453.75 466.76 B: doing anything about it it's not gonna stop you know then it's like well the last time i can do it again you know and then it just compounds and then you really got a problem on your hands so [laughter] i'm well thinking that you'd almost be better off 

454.11 456.53 A: [noise] then they'll do it more than once [noise] 

457.40 458.09 A: (( yup )) 

459.84 460.71 A: (( [noise] )) 

460.82 461.78 A: yeah that's 

467.18 469.32 B: depending again depending on the situation 

467.36 468.37 A: (( [noise] [noise] what um )) 

468.50 470.29 A: didn't punish the first time huh 

470.25 476.62 B: well and m- make sure that they understand that this is not something that this is acceptable you know 

476.01 477.02 A: (( right )) 

478.62 479.54 A: (( [cough] )) 

481.77 482.58 A: [noise] 

486.42 489.75 B: what do you think i mean do you do you think that's what the shouldn't happen that the 

488.86 494.61 A: well i think that's pretty much what i think the same but i don't know it is a hard decision 

494.86 499.12 A: if it came down to my kids i don't know what i would do once i was put in that position i guess 

499.03 502.13 B: yeah well you know i think a lot depends on what else is going on 

501.28 505.87 A: [noise] right the circumstances and all surrounding it and 

502.18 503.81 B: i don't think you know 

505.02 506.16 B: exactly 

506.15 509.01 A: consequences and 

506.25 507.31 B: (( i mean if you )) 

509.52 513.87 A: how long it would be they went to jail or whatever would happen whatever 

511.59 512.80 B: well you know 

513.19 514.41 B: i had a 

514.73 520.63 B: you know a girl friend and her daughter ah was skipping school she was doing all this stuff and you know it got to be 

521.46 527.52 B: ridiculous you know everything that was happening and then in her you know she took her car one night 

527.70 530.88 B: climbed out her window at the second floor i mean the whole 

531.97 538.03 B: she called her on it she called the police the police came found her found the car 

537.86 539.85 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

538.16 540.14 B: you know brought her home 

540.34 546.54 B: went to court went through the whole thing um she j- you know she got stuck with community service but 

547.26 556.56 A: well most people on their kids and then when the cops do come they don't really do nothing about it anyway they just do it as a scare tactic too so and they feel bad after they done it 

547.63 548.77 B: she straightened up and 

549.34 550.87 B: straightened up and right 

553.65 555.11 B: yeah well 

556.29 564.68 B: well i i know linda felt bad but she thought it was the best thing to do so she did and [noise] you know now sabrina's back on the you know the right track went to college dah dah dah you know 

563.76 565.75 A: (( well that's good )) 

564.79 566.14 B: you know a good thing 

565.80 567.48 A: what happened to her when she 

567.54 569.70 B: ah she ended up with community service 

569.78 570.64 B: um 

571.31 578.10 B: for you know they went through the whole thing and she had to pay restitution 'cause she got in a she got hit somebody with it i mean she hit someone's ah car 

577.35 584.50 A: see that would be a little more serious than ah it doesn't really specifically say what they are exactly talking about on that subject so 

581.74 583.10 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

583.59 589.00 B: yeah well perjury is pretty i mean it's it sounds cut and dried as it sounds i guess [noise] 

588.14 589.70 A: (( mhm )) 

589.73 591.63 B: but yeah i think it'd be 

592.23 596.22 B: think it'd be difficult to to do that to a your family but on the other hand 

594.87 598.61 A: [noise] yeah and then you gotta worry about your own self too what's gonna happen to you if you did 

598.71 599.67 B: yeah
