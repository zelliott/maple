0.00 1.04 B: hello 

0.19 6.41 A: hello hi how are you my name is gerry and i live in mesa arizona 

1.36 2.25 B: hi 

6.06 10.20 B: hi um this is angeline and i live in [noise] chicago illinois 

9.96 15.63 A: well it's good to ah talk to you this is kind of an interesting program isn't it 

15.03 18.48 B: yeah i was just talking to a friend about um 

18.57 22.69 B: what they could be possibly studying but [laughter] 

21.30 27.41 A: [laughter] i guess i heard it was dialect people's d- mhm people's uh-huh 

24.48 25.83 B: (( [noise] oh dialect )) 

25.86 27.10 B: (( really )) 

27.43 32.21 B: [noise] oh my gosh that that was totally off i did not even think about that 

27.49 28.55 A: (( yeah )) 

31.55 38.74 A: yeah yeah that's that's what i heard [laughter] so anyway but i guess today our topic 

34.10 35.96 B: (( oh interesting [noise] [noise] )) 

38.81 44.87 A: is would we ever commit perjury for a close friend or family member 

44.33 45.68 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

45.06 49.60 A: i guess and i don't know i don't think i ever would 

49.98 53.40 A: i mean i think it would be probably [laughter] testing 

53.49 67.35 A: but um um i don't think if i was in court i i'm kind of leary of the court system so i think and i'm kind of respectful of it so i don't think that i would commit perjury do you i mean 

67.16 71.69 B: um i think i definitely would yeah [laughter] 

68.65 80.62 A: would you yeah [laughter] okay ah yeah i th- i wouldn't i don't think i think i'd be too terrified in case i got caught [laughter] yeah you know 

78.00 79.13 B: yeah 

80.23 82.71 B: well i wouldn't be terrified of getting caught but um 

83.10 86.94 B: [noise] the way t- i mean going with i mean of course it would depend on the situation 

86.72 87.84 A: (( mhm )) 

87.14 89.86 B: but um if it was something where 

90.31 92.72 B: it was if it was a situation where 

91.68 92.89 A: (( mhm )) 

93.07 95.79 B: i felt perjury wouldn't help the situation 

95.65 97.08 A: (( mhm )) 

96.06 100.26 B: and um and i thought that the person no matter how much i loved them 

100.46 103.71 B: should go to jail because they did something really wrong 

103.40 106.14 A: (( mhm )) 

104.11 108.53 B: then then i wouldn't do it just because i wouldn't i i would think that they they 

108.59 109.55 B: should 

109.64 111.03 B: probably try and 

110.68 111.79 A: (( mhm )) 

111.09 112.12 B: um 

112.15 114.52 B: reap the consequences you know 

113.42 116.18 A: (( yeah mhm yeah )) 

114.79 116.72 B: but if it was something where 

117.58 119.94 B: you know i think that it 

118.69 124.50 A: if they weren't guilty or something and they didn't have a good case sort of stuff then i guess we 

121.88 126.21 B: yeah then i would lie to the best of my ability [laughter] 

125.03 135.23 A: yeah i think i think i probably would but i would be very apprehensive i ah because i don't know i guess i just i'm afraid of the court system or something you know 

134.89 135.91 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

135.33 138.84 A: it would be like i would feel like if i was lying on the 

138.85 143.83 A: stand that they'd be able to tell and i'd be terrified that i'd get caught 

143.92 147.00 A: but if i figured i'd never get caught 

147.46 151.85 A: and i think if i really knew that they needed it you know 

151.99 157.05 A: i would but i think if they were guilty of something i don't think i'd lie i you know 

157.16 166.48 A: i don't i don't know [laughter] i guess i have to put myself in the place of what you know if it was my husband or my child or something you know 

165.82 166.78 B: yeah 

167.51 172.20 A: and i don't know what i would do i would be terrified you know 

172.75 173.99 A: (( but ah )) 

174.21 183.21 A: but i don't know so thank goodness hopefully i won't have to ever do that [laughter] oh i know gee 

178.17 179.27 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

179.32 180.51 B: yeah really 

182.25 184.16 B: i think it i think it'd be um 

185.16 186.39 B: i think it'd be 

186.57 194.99 B: 'cause i i think i think the court system is completely screwed up [laughter] so because of that i would i'd probably um 

189.94 191.49 A: oh yeah 

195.25 206.62 B: i would have no remorse in lying in court or anything like that 'cause it's it's so messed up and it's so unfair and it's not it's o- often times it's not the justice isn't even you know 

198.56 199.28 A: (( mm )) 

206.42 207.48 A: no 

206.91 208.28 B: successful so 

207.67 215.58 A: you're right you're right yeah and it seems like they have their either an overkill or a tap on the hand you know 

215.13 216.16 B: right 

215.49 227.48 A: if if you have the smallest offence they want to put you in jail for like a hundred years but if you murder somebody they're all you know they're like oh well you know that's okay you know 

220.75 221.72 B: right 

227.42 232.79 A: i don't know it just is totally and i do think it does need to be major overhaul 

227.43 228.37 B: yeah 

229.53 230.26 B: and it 

232.52 240.27 B: oh definitely 'cause i mean so much of it now is is how is based on how good your lawyer is um how 

233.63 234.36 A: (( yeah )) 

237.90 239.32 A: mhm 

240.29 245.21 B: how um how much of a biased jury that you can get um 

243.89 245.30 A: mhm 

245.27 253.34 B: maybe media attention you know there's so many factors involved that that don't actually reflect your ac- the actual 

254.17 255.20 A: situa- 

254.26 256.92 B: evidence and case and you know 

256.55 258.37 A: yeah yeah 

258.40 259.84 B: so if i was able 

260.17 263.06 B: to sway that anyway 'cause i mean everybody lies 

260.25 261.61 A: (( that's a [sigh] )) 

263.12 264.12 A: oh 

263.58 268.98 B: in court anyway [sigh] so i mean even the lawyers um persuade their 

264.55 267.14 A: mhm yeah 

268.91 280.05 A: you know and i don't know if like even with that lacy peterson case the thing that really bothers me about it is that it seems like the media is trying the man 

269.10 270.40 B: (( clients to lie )) 

280.50 281.44 A: and i 

280.57 282.35 B: the what they're trying what 

281.75 290.06 A: the media is trying the husband you know it's like and i don't know whether he's guilty or not i and i couldn't care less but 

284.47 286.05 B: oh yeah 

290.55 295.92 A: but i don't like the idea that if like we've convicted this man before 

296.24 304.76 A: the media and before the t._v. [laughter] and we don't even know i mean the whole situation or the whole story 

304.07 305.02 B: yeah 

304.79 306.39 A: you know so 

305.40 308.14 B: and of course now because of the media there's like 

308.38 309.65 B: there's more 

309.92 313.74 B: in- um pressure to go along with what the media 

314.03 315.65 B: would like to see happen 

315.25 320.04 A: yeah yeah yeah i don't know so i feel 

315.99 316.91 B: (( you know )) 

318.79 321.70 B: and that's a lot more corrupt than than a loved one 

321.76 325.90 B: lying a little bit for [laughter] for family members or whatever 

323.34 328.00 A: yeah yeah you know oh 

328.18 341.87 A: but ah but anyway i you know i don't know what i you know if my daughter were ever you know in terrible trouble and needed a lie or something i don't i don't know i'd 

342.26 346.44 A: i'd probably i as much as i would want to i don't think i'd be able to 

346.63 349.24 A: but just because i'd be afraid you know 

348.95 349.85 B: yeah 

349.68 357.02 A: but i don't i i don't blame anybody for who does because it's like this whole court system is just all screwed up 

357.59 361.66 A: you know i don't know so have you lived in chicago your whole life 

358.44 359.62 B: yeah 

361.39 367.80 B: oh no i just that's why i thought it was funny when you said that it was to check on dialect because i've only lived here for six months 

365.72 366.67 A: (( uh-huh )) 

367.67 368.92 A: oh really 

368.23 369.31 B: (( [sigh] [laughter] )) 

368.97 376.51 A: well i'll be darned yeah no i i that's what i heard when i you know when i signed up for it you know 

371.54 372.08 B: (( ah )) 

376.42 384.13 A: i guess they're doing a bunch of different studies but that's that's what i heard the main study was based on was different dialects of people 

383.78 384.61 B: hm 

384.42 388.42 A: because they are getting people from all over the country i guess 

387.87 390.24 B: [noise] have you lived in ah arizona all your life 

389.71 398.79 A: um i i've lived here most of my life i i'm fifty five and i've probably been in arizona you know like 

398.89 401.77 A: forty five or forty six years so 

401.19 402.22 B: wow [noise] 

401.83 403.21 A: (( yeah )) 

402.25 408.10 B: yeah i was gonna say you definitely have a dialect i didn't know if that was a arizonian a- dialect or not [sigh] 

404.28 405.48 A: (( [laughter] )) 

406.76 413.20 A: yeah yeah i i did live in arkansas for about ah three years 

413.21 423.01 A: ah and of course it's been almost thirty years but but i do have kind of a ah i i pick up a twang from that at different times you know 

421.48 424.17 B: yeah that's not from arizona 

423.64 429.15 A: ah well i think most of it's arizona [laughter] i guess i would guess since i've been here so long 

426.16 427.27 B: [laughter] 

429.32 433.21 A: you know but ah and you are you from illinois or 

433.28 434.60 B: am i what 

434.01 435.75 A: are you from illinois 

435.83 437.30 B: um no i 

437.61 443.53 B: i've moved around so much so i think that's why i don't have any particular dialect i grew up a lot in texas 

439.48 440.39 A: uh-huh 

441.62 442.64 A: uh-huh 

443.73 448.83 B: i so i got kind of a slurry mouth from texas [laughter] you know the lazy mouth 

446.40 448.41 A: [laughter] yeah uh-huh 

448.43 449.89 A: yeah uh-huh 

449.06 451.96 B: but um and then moved to the north west 

451.71 453.44 A: mhm 

452.22 453.69 B: and so now i'm 

453.56 456.10 A: doing you're in the in chicago 

455.66 456.77 B: yeah 

456.79 457.95 A: (( huh )) 

457.79 461.57 B: it gets really it gets pretty cold in the winter time right now it's um 

458.08 460.15 A: (( is it cold over )) 

461.74 464.57 B: summer is starting to get here it's warm now 

462.92 468.22 A: there uh-huh yeah yeah it's real pretty here too just gorgeous in the eighties 

468.10 477.69 B: yeah i and i heard that arizona has the dry heat right which is good see i- chicago it doesn't get it like extraordinarily hot but it gets very humid 

470.99 472.63 A: yeah yeah 

477.37 478.43 A: mhm 

478.38 480.61 B: 'cause of the lake and stuff 

479.24 480.24 A: oh 

480.49 484.18 A: yeah 'cause you're isn't chicago kind of on a lake i think 

483.72 489.03 B: yeah it's really it's it's completely bordered by the lakes so that's why we get a lot of humidity 

484.34 485.39 A: okay 

487.33 498.57 A: mhm yeah i that would be terrible well let's see when it's hot here it's hot in july and august it's pr- pretty miserable 'cause it's like in the hundred and fifteens 

497.55 500.96 B: [noise] wow [laughter] 

498.67 503.76 A: yeah and it is hot and even if it's and it's dry 

503.99 514.75 A: but it is still hot if you open up a oven you know when you're baking something that's how it feels when you go outside mhm so it is miserable 

508.76 509.78 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

511.48 513.33 B: (( wow t- )) 

514.05 516.34 B: so what is m- what what do most people do 

516.42 521.90 A: um there's a lot of ah tourist industry here and um 

521.99 534.64 A: we have i worked for state government for most of my career but um there's a lot of farming and agricultural in the rural area and then in phoenix i think it's mostly the tourism 

531.11 532.14 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

534.81 545.82 A: you know people coming to visit and that kind of thing and we have you know um some electronic factories and um but we don't have a whole lot of um 

544.64 545.53 B: yeah 

545.88 547.86 A: you know industry here 

548.42 554.54 B: well no wonder why you're um you'd be afraid to um perjure because you worked for the state government for most of your life 

548.68 549.51 A: (( so )) 

554.20 556.84 A: yeah [laughter] 

554.58 560.94 B: [laughter] you probably have a very um deep rooted respect slash fear for the government [noise] 

558.23 559.56 A: (( yeah )) 

560.29 564.09 A: well yeah i probably do and it's and it's like um 

564.20 577.76 A: you know i think it's ah you know i also in in that career i was like a policy writer so i wrote manuals and i had to interpret federal regulations and that kind of thing so 

576.78 577.89 B: yeah 

577.76 582.00 A: it was kind of like it's very it was very black and white you know 

581.19 582.65 B: right exactly 

582.23 584.25 A: [laughter] so 

583.54 585.89 B: that's interesting [laughter] 

584.61 591.93 A: yeah but ah yeah so i probably am you know i'm kind of wary you know kind of like ah 

591.95 599.89 A: since it was my bread and butter it that's probably another reason why i would you know be leary of of ah
