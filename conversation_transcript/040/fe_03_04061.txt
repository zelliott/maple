0.45 1.62 A: hello 

0.95 2.66 B: hi this is lisa 

2.26 3.95 A: hi lisa this is jim 

3.89 4.98 B: hi jim 

4.61 5.90 A: how ya doing 

5.31 6.44 B: i'm fine 

6.42 8.20 A: uh did you hear the topic 

7.76 10.03 B: yes the topic of the day is uh 

10.24 11.95 B: opening your own business 

11.23 13.38 A: yes you have any ideas 

13.16 14.26 B: yes 

14.04 15.00 A: yeah 

14.46 18.63 B: okay i feel like this how a person can really open their own business 

18.68 21.22 B: money talks a blue blue crab walks 

20.45 22.01 A: [laughter] 

21.31 23.30 B: so you have to save money 

22.92 23.93 A: uh-huh 

23.82 29.43 B: so if somebody if you put money away for ten years twenty dollars for ten years 

26.86 27.92 A: mhm 

29.13 30.17 A: mhm 

29.56 32.24 B: then you're saving something for opening something 

31.94 32.89 A: uh-huh 

32.55 34.68 B: you can't save nothing without no money 

34.21 35.48 A: i agree 

34.99 43.51 B: you can't do anything without no money so first of all your first plan has to be how i'm gonna save some money to work toward this goal 

36.57 37.65 A: right 

43.01 48.33 A: that's true i agree with that what what business would you have in mind i i 

47.15 51.80 B: [lipsmack] what business i would have in mind i would have uh either 

49.12 49.70 A: (( yeah )) 

52.04 54.52 B: uh a barber shop 

54.16 55.18 A: uh-huh 

54.80 56.60 B: or a hair salon 

56.37 57.68 A: oh wow 

57.31 68.12 B: and i say a barber shop would be more easier than a hair salon because a hair salon you have to do so many people hair you stand up all day a barber shop is not so bad that's all you're doing is cutting hair 

60.22 61.18 A: mhm 

62.62 63.68 A: right 

64.30 65.28 A: mhm 

67.43 68.94 A: right right 

68.59 72.28 B: and you have to have a skill you don't have no skill you can't do nothing without nothing 

71.87 73.74 A: that's true yes 

72.81 74.89 B: so nothing gets you nothing 

74.32 77.27 A: [laughter] yes 

75.76 80.45 B: so i know that um so i would try to cut hair first learn how to cut hair 

79.96 81.16 A: right 

80.63 81.97 B: which is easy 

81.55 82.53 A: uh-huh 

82.17 83.74 B: (( and you've learned how to do that )) 

83.43 84.66 A: yeah 

84.25 88.26 B: i mean you can a little rent a little uh rent a little booth 

87.99 89.57 A: mhm 

89.20 90.67 B: for like uh 

91.19 92.93 B: six seven hundred dollars a month 

92.55 93.57 A: uh-huh 

93.37 99.62 B: and one day you've got a business you've got a family business and you start off you start off from the bottom and work your way up 

95.50 96.42 A: yeah 

98.99 102.14 A: that's the way to do it yeah i agree 

100.58 102.91 B: you know so that's my idea 

102.14 104.12 A: yeah yeah i 

103.98 109.21 A: you know what when they asked i'm thinking to myself gee what business would i even wanna get into i i 

109.04 118.22 A: i'm on in the financial end of things i i do taxes at the um [lipsmack] uh taxis and i guess i wouldn't mind opening up a a store front 

118.03 126.11 A: and doing something like that but like you said you you really want need the resources behind you to get get started yeah and uh 

123.92 125.14 B: yes 

126.18 136.21 A: i i don't know if i i don't know if i'd wanna do that though i mean i i do it now and i kinda do it at my own pace and i do it out of my house and it's it's uh pretty comfortable but 

135.65 136.78 B: yes 

136.17 148.54 A: um it's it's a major commitment i'll tell you that much 'cause i i see the business owners in the neighborhood and uh a lot of them are there very early and they leave very late and they they work uh some weekends 

148.44 158.88 A: um so if you're gonna be in a business like that i don't know you lose an awful lot of quality time with family that way you know it's it's not as easy as people think you know 

158.00 163.96 B: you know what and and it will become a family business that's what the family we go- we gonna be right there 

159.83 161.67 A: (( mm )) 

163.48 168.74 A: uh that's the way to do it 'cause at least your your family's with you during the day yeah 

164.88 165.91 B: you know 

166.79 167.75 B: yes 

168.07 171.41 B: you know like the families at school why you doing that 

170.48 172.91 A: mhm right right 

171.90 178.63 B: [lipsmack] like okay w- with this business and then you get like a like a like a um uh like in the back where you can cook 

178.79 183.85 B: so you could you could you know cook your dinner you know if you're the boss you don't really have to be there 

180.68 181.62 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

183.34 184.47 A: that's true 

183.89 185.51 B: this is a barber shop 

184.99 186.48 A: right right 

185.54 187.88 B: that's all you'll gotta do is get people to work for you 

187.49 188.80 A: that's true 

188.29 191.63 B: and you only have to be there once once everything is established 

191.05 192.44 A: mhm 

191.91 196.23 B: you know once you see who can trust and who's reliable who's responsible 

195.84 197.03 A: right 

196.59 199.50 B: then you know you can keep that person there all the time 

198.97 201.01 A: right that's yeah 

199.89 202.34 B: so you know until you learn the business 

201.79 216.04 A: mhm right i guess with everything that works you have to get the training first and really know know the subject inside and out before you get into it yeah uh i like your idea is uh is this something you've thought of seriously or 

206.38 207.50 B: yes 

210.31 211.57 B: yes 

215.48 218.70 B: i've i've thought of it v- very seriously because you know what 

217.41 218.31 A: really 

218.74 222.64 B: you know nobody's not gonna give you anything especially not for free 

220.38 221.90 A: no that's true 

222.18 223.25 A: right 

222.65 226.45 B: and you've got to work hard if you really want something you've gotta work hard for it 

225.58 226.68 A: yes 

226.64 229.65 B: you know and um i'm good with money 

227.04 228.11 A: yeah 

229.25 230.80 A: uh-huh oh that's good 

230.40 231.53 B: so 

231.01 232.32 A: yeah 

231.83 243.42 B: but right now financially i'm kinda like like messed up right now because i'm going through a situation right now but i tell ya if i wasn't going through that situation i'd be straight 'cause i could be putting money away every week 

234.90 236.23 A: mhm 

237.36 238.27 A: (( mhm )) 

240.19 241.31 A: yeah 

242.82 244.37 A: right which is 

245.39 249.47 B: now it's like now i can't put no money away right now because of my situation 

247.94 250.22 A: mhm right 

249.88 250.83 B: so 

250.36 255.80 A: well hopefully that'll get straightened out for ya and then you can start to move forward yeah 

254.09 257.59 B: yes so i'm moving forward just saving money 

257.13 258.15 A: right 

257.64 260.38 B: and once i get the certain kinda money that i wanna save 

259.82 261.40 A: mhm 

260.69 263.44 B: then i can talk you know i'll say well i've got 

261.66 262.71 A: yeah 

263.56 265.59 B: ten thousand dollars for this 

265.12 267.17 A: mhm right 

266.31 267.92 B: that's a start to something 

267.62 269.30 A: right plus 

268.59 271.53 B: and between that time i could be going through the training 

271.19 273.89 A: mhm right that's true yeah 

272.94 276.10 B: so right now um i wanna get into the school 

275.50 276.92 A: mhm 

276.58 278.42 B: with the cosmetology 

279.10 286.57 B: because you could do a lot um you know you could do nails you could do feet and you know i could take it a whole lotta other places also 

283.16 284.10 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

286.21 288.09 A: mhm yeah 

287.22 291.38 B: um you could do make up so there's there's so many places you can go 

288.69 289.67 A: right 

290.96 292.56 A: yeah yeah 

292.04 295.35 B: also a barber shop that that specializes in all of that 

294.72 296.67 A: yes some of them do 

296.50 306.22 A: some of them have everything yeah well that's a great goal and and you know also uh if you do save up a bunch of money and you show the bank that you're serious um 

306.05 312.16 A: if you go to uh the s._b._a. small business administration and you show them you're serious and you write up 

311.93 322.14 A: a um a logical uh business plan uh they will give you a low cost loan to help you get started but you have to show them you're really serious about it 

321.61 322.78 B: yes 

322.13 325.34 A: but um i have been there i have been to the s._b._a. 

325.14 339.87 A: and they're good people they really do want to help small business owners get started um they they won't give you a grant unfortunately but they will give ya a low cost loan to help you get started and um that would definitely help 'cause the capital in the beginning is is the tough part 

339.69 341.88 A: you know 'cause you have to rent the place ya 

341.65 349.23 A: might even need some uh some chairs some chairs to cut hair in and and the equipment and all that stuff 

349.04 362.55 A: uh i mean unless you find a place that just went out of business a hair a barber shop or a hair salon that just went out of business and then you can take over their equipment but um if not you have to buy the equipment and so the start up's going to be a little bit costly 

362.40 363.50 B: yes 

362.94 369.45 A: but uh once you get rolling you know and and you do good work and word of mouth gets out you know you're gonna be in good shape 

369.08 370.99 B: yes yes 

369.61 371.71 A: yeah yeah 

371.14 374.88 B: i think i'd make the barber shop like like like a home atmosphere 

374.54 375.58 A: mhm 

374.99 376.92 B: to make people wanna come there 

376.25 379.31 A: right that would be good business yeah 

378.16 382.33 B: you know like you know get your little stereo system get the cable 

380.88 381.85 A: mhm 

382.06 383.18 A: mhm 

382.45 388.06 B: you know to make people wanna come to the barber shop 'cause everybody has to go to the barber shop to get their hair cut 

384.83 386.38 A: that's a great idea 

387.31 390.18 A: that's right that's right you can't live without that 

388.89 392.74 B: so i'd make it like a family atmosphere where they feel comfortable 

390.76 391.79 A: uh-huh 

392.30 393.73 A: right 

393.19 396.21 B: you know try to make it home as comfortable as possible 

395.74 396.95 A: i like that 

396.34 398.69 B: so you know decorate it really nice 

398.13 399.54 A: mhm 

398.93 402.74 B: you know to people in inside like this is really nice 

402.30 408.30 A: right yeah have it yeah bring 'em coming back yeah yeah oh wow 

403.14 406.42 B: you know so that's my idea that's my dream 

407.18 409.72 B: and i know that i'm gonna achieve it 

409.07 421.82 A: okay i like that i like your attitude that's great you know that's half the battle you know the the mind when you convince yourself in your mind that you wanna go in a certain direction and wanna do a certain thing that's that's half the battle right there 

421.08 423.03 B: yes 'cause nobody's gonna give me nothing 

422.66 425.17 A: right no that's you're absolutely right 

423.55 431.58 B: you know so i don't wanna work for nobody i want my own money i wanna do my own thing i want to people to come to me for a job look up to me 

426.93 428.06 A: i agree 

428.39 429.33 A: right 

430.96 435.57 A: right right no it's uh it's the best way to work 

434.65 438.70 B: then i give my nephews a job you know people with some responsibility 

436.52 437.43 A: mhm 

438.15 439.54 A: right 

438.99 441.66 B: you know my son you know uh 

440.15 441.13 A: mhm 

442.10 443.65 B: we'll be secure 

443.33 452.14 A: right no that's an excellent idea and you're right it's it's easier when you can run things there's more responsibility but it's definitely easier and uh oh 

450.84 454.46 B: yes and i'm very i'm very like um very organized 

454.45 455.60 A: that's great 

455.23 460.93 B: so being that i'm organized it'd be so much easier for me to really go in there and run a business 

458.36 459.41 A: mhm 

460.32 462.38 A: right yeah 

461.47 475.89 B: so that's all i need to know is the business sense of it i have to learn the business sense of it and learn the skill once i got that nobody can take the skill away from me just like nobody can take education away from you once you're educated nobody can take that smartness away from you 

464.01 464.90 A: right 

465.95 466.98 A: mhm 

467.61 468.36 A: right 

470.04 471.18 A: that's true 

472.30 473.40 A: that's right 

475.44 482.23 A: mhm yes yes i um [lipsmack] well the person i go to she cuts hair um she's worked 

482.64 488.16 A: quite a while for um the local barber shop here and uh she learned her trade there 

487.98 498.07 A: um actually i think she went to school for a little while and then she kind of worked she rented a chair out in this barber shop and she was doing really well and then the owner had 

497.86 509.36 A: um had to leave the business and uh she ended up selling it to this person that cut my hair and she bought the um the hair the hair cutting shop over and uh now she's her own boss 

509.19 520.07 A: um she ended up moving away so she put her shop in her basement and she's cutting hair out of her basement and she's still doing quite well yeah yeah but the 

517.57 519.01 B: [noise] that's good 

519.43 520.71 B: that's good 

520.08 527.65 A: the thing about it was she was just very friendly very personable uh she does have a cable t._v. and um 

527.53 534.91 A: you know you could probably do a little more in this area like you're talking about she can make it a little bit more homey and uh make you feel 

534.74 540.94 A: um more like it's a place to just relax it still has like a barber shop type of feel to it but 

540.73 553.48 A: uh she between her being a very friendly and um just she's uh a good business woman um you wanna go back you know you feel like you you wanna stay with her and i've stayed with her for years so 

553.40 563.85 A: um you know if you've met the customer and you give him a good good value and you make him feel comfortable and and you know you make him feel like you said one of the family when he comes in 

563.15 564.52 B: yes 

563.96 566.50 A: boy he's gonna come back every time mhm 

565.67 575.30 B: yes just like i got my hair done and i wanted it sawn because you know i really didn't really get treated how i was supposed to get treated the client always win 

572.94 574.06 A: right 

574.96 576.04 A: mhm 

575.48 581.04 B: you know what i'm saying if i mess up say if i mess up a client's hair i'm like come back for a month free 

578.25 579.26 A: mhm 

580.45 581.83 A: right right 

581.20 585.35 B: free of charge you know what i'm saying because that's the way i want to be treated 

582.10 583.91 A: (( ex- exactly )) 

584.75 585.75 A: right 

585.38 589.30 B: so i'm gonna treat people how i want to be treated which is well 

587.30 588.46 A: exactly 

588.91 590.01 A: yes 

589.48 593.07 B: and it doesn't hold me back because i treat them well 

590.88 591.94 A: mhm 

592.48 593.33 A: yes 

593.35 595.88 A: no that's that's exactly right i mean 

595.05 597.26 B: so you definitely have to be a people person 

596.75 598.15 A: yes you do 

597.28 599.95 B: (( you know i mean if you're working with people and then you don't want ))
