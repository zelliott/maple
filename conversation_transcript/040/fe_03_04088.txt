169.31 181.70 A: oh well then you you're well on your way to start something like that and if you already have contacts then you can find a legitimate way to start on the internet with it [mn] you know it's a 

173.41 174.35 B: (( whenever you see )) 

175.55 176.46 B: (( you )) 

181.92 188.92 A: it's a i would love to do something like that as well but i'm just so afraid that i would get caught up in some scam or something [laughter] 

187.88 191.79 B: (( know like pay twenty five dollars for a list i never fall )) 

190.66 191.67 A: mhm 

192.24 194.38 B: (( for that [laughter] but uh-huh for like six )) 

193.15 196.82 A: oh do you i just started it t- also yeah 

195.20 195.93 B: (( months )) 

196.20 200.40 B: (( and i thought oh well that was a big scam and then i started to get assignments )) 

199.87 201.05 A: mhm 

200.91 202.40 B: (( just in the )) 

203.38 205.77 B: (( last two months and i think )) 

204.52 211.73 A: mhm well see i made the mistake and i did pay for the mystery shopping um [lipsmack] list thirty dollars 

211.35 212.11 B: (( i work )) 

212.93 213.85 B: (( for really )) 

214.60 218.92 A: (( and i didn't hear from )) 

219.40 220.19 A: (( them oh )) 

220.26 223.25 A: really [laughter] five different companies now and 

223.00 223.93 B: wow 

223.29 231.13 A: it's really a lot of fun it's um pretty easy money and you know especially if you go like to go out to eat or shop it's 

230.50 237.33 B: yeah like i just got a cantonese assignment like a month ago and once a week my husband can go out to eat you know almost for free 

235.62 236.47 A: (( oh )) 

236.90 238.70 A: uh-huh yeah 

237.45 241.41 B: so i really enjoy it and then you just put it on the computer you know the form 

241.10 242.27 A: mhm 

241.59 246.91 B: so that's that's pretty much my business right now at home but i'd like for it to grow into full time 

246.58 247.72 A: right 

247.01 249.81 B: and then do the typing too on the side 

248.71 249.79 A: mhm 

249.98 262.67 A: yeah the typing one sounds like a great idea actually i was just talking to my husband about this last night i said you know now that my kids are getting older it's it's harder for me to work on the weekends and i would love to have my own business at home 

262.44 263.41 B: right 

262.59 267.67 A: because they have activities now on the weekends when they were babies it worked out just fine 

267.31 276.15 B: oh my one of my girlfriends she has like um three boys they're two and a half um six and eight and they're all getting into activities too especially the older one 

268.18 268.97 A: (( so [mn] )) 

275.53 276.86 A: oh yeah 

276.18 280.80 B: and it's getting harder for her she doesn't doesn't work outside the home but she sells longaberger 

280.53 281.81 A: oh okay 

281.26 287.17 B: and she really enjoys that so that's another good you know home business like sell products like that 

282.68 283.83 A: mhm 

286.57 294.97 A: right right i know a lot of the people i work with always bring in their tupperware books and home interiors and everything else since 

287.94 288.66 B: (( so )) 

294.02 296.66 B: do you have any longaberger people out there or 

296.46 304.19 A: um [lipsmack] not that i know personally i'm i'm familiar with the company and i know my sister in law has quite a few of their things i love it 

299.32 300.25 B: oh really 

303.05 307.98 B: it seems like it's all over the united states i mean now wherever you go they've heard of [laughter] 

304.93 306.71 A: mhm yeah 

307.36 310.93 A: right right well it's nice stuff and um 

309.16 310.62 B: (( it yeah )) 

311.34 318.83 A: yeah that's another idea that i guess yeah that one you you'd have to have a large group of people that you know that you can you know 

318.53 324.27 B: but my problem is i know too many people that sell the baskets and all my family like buys from different people and 

318.85 320.38 A: try to get your sales 

323.42 327.91 A: right right and then you feel like it's kind of a hassle yeah [laughter] uh-huh 

324.30 326.27 B: it's like saturate 

326.63 333.01 B: yeah [laughter] and you are required by the company to sell i think a certain amount every month to even stay a consultant 

332.69 333.82 A: mhm 

333.23 338.00 B: so i don't think they want people just you know sell a hundred dollars here and there they want the big sales [laughter] 

337.44 341.57 A: oh wow yeah that would be kind of a lot of pressure then you know 

338.57 339.35 B: (( so yeah )) 

340.40 345.00 B: yeah so i wouldn't i don't think i'd be interested but um i do collect some of the longaberger 

344.85 346.37 A: oh mhm 

345.77 352.32 B: so i like it i just i would want something that i wouldn't be pressured like you have to sell so much this month and 

346.98 348.33 A: oh yeah 

351.77 356.65 A: mhm yeah yeah that would that would be too much for me too i think i'd rather 

352.44 353.23 B: (( so )) 

356.77 360.88 A: go out to a job than have that kind of sales pressure so 

360.50 361.87 B: right [laughter] 

361.34 363.22 A: yeah so 

362.38 366.15 B: but but it's been two years since i got laid off at a attorney's office 

365.85 367.06 A: oh wow 

366.50 377.55 B: and then i i just collected unemployment for like almost a year since they extended it and then i started you know doing mystery shopping last summer i just typed it in the computer and i thought oh wow look at all this stuff out here 

370.77 371.76 A: uh-huh 

377.22 382.94 A: uh-huh so you didn't pay for any of that you just [mn] found the different companies and things 

377.76 379.49 B: 'cause i always thought it was a scam 

380.67 381.59 B: (( no )) 

381.86 387.75 B: no i just typed in mystery shopping and all these sites come up where you could go in and and apply 

383.99 384.87 A: uh-huh 

386.07 387.38 A: oh 

387.60 388.57 A: uh-huh 

387.83 392.97 B: it just takes forever because you have to type in all your i- information for each company but i was like 

391.21 396.81 A: right right yeah all the applications and i live in a real small town so 

394.71 395.54 B: mhm 

396.87 402.69 A: um the closest big city i am i'm closest to is madison wisconsin 

401.69 404.38 B: oh really i've i think i've heard of that 

402.87 403.77 A: (( and )) 

403.79 412.47 A: yeah and that's that's not anything near like a chicago or you know a real big city so i don't get as many assignments as i'd like but 

411.47 415.08 B: i would to be- um i live an hour away from columbus 

414.63 415.82 A: oh okay 

415.32 424.89 B: you've probably heard of columbus but um i live in a little town called zanesville and it doesn't have very much you know to offer but i do get you know assignments here and there so 

416.30 417.55 A: oh yeah 

420.78 421.62 A: uh-huh 

422.09 422.88 A: uh-huh 

424.85 425.71 A: uh-huh

427.26 438.58 A: yeah i do too i just um got one for a grocery store which works out really nice [laughter] you know yeah yeah so that's it that's a fun hobby i just uh 

432.13 434.73 B: yeah you get like free groceries or 

438.43 443.97 B: yeah it's a lot of people think of it as a hobby but you know unless you live in a big city you probably can't do it full time 

438.59 440.63 A: wish i could get it to pay a little more 

441.02 441.95 A: mhm 

443.79 444.86 A: yeah 

444.24 448.66 B: unless like you know you sign up for every i think there's five hundred and some companies 

448.33 451.24 A: [lipsmack] wow oh i wasn't aware that there were that many i've 

450.64 453.00 B: it's just finding them you know [laughter] 

452.16 456.88 A: right i guess i'd better get back on the computer [laughter] check it out 

454.61 468.50 B: [laughter] yeah i find them on forums too like you you know you have a internet site and you have a forum like a mystery shopper forum and people post like information out there for other fellow shoppers so that's really helpful 

460.54 461.51 A: uh-huh 

462.77 463.72 A: uh-huh 

466.45 467.37 A: uh-huh

486.58 487.54 A: uh-huh 

488.57 492.95 A: yeah i thought so too i thought well i could probably talk for ten minutes [laughter] 

491.84 493.83 B: (( because i like talking on the phone )) 

493.17 497.17 A: [laughter] yeah sure [sigh] yeah so

496.83 497.96 B: yeah 

497.37 505.06 A: other than those jobs i c- i'm i'm not crafty at all so i don't think i could come up with any kind of a craft business [laughter] 

504.11 512.31 B: no i like cross stitch and i like latch hook and needlepoint but i don't you know it seems like craft stores are like populated everywhere though 

507.37 508.41 A: uh-huh 

511.88 513.09 A: right 

512.37 515.14 B: unless you could come up with the unique craft 

514.58 517.60 A: mhm right 

515.25 517.12 B: something that no one else has 

517.43 519.78 B: because i love doing craft so [laughter] 

519.19 520.19 A: uh-huh 

520.38 523.28 B: it's just finding the time you know to do 

520.48 521.49 A: yeah 

522.24 524.25 A: oh yeah do you have children 

523.80 528.51 B: it no i don't have any kids um my husband and i just got married uh four and a half years ago 

524.41 525.06 A: (( no )) 

526.71 527.50 A: oh 

528.08 529.11 A: uh-huh 

528.85 534.16 B: so we're we still feel like newlyweds [laughter] so how many years have you been married 

530.66 532.51 A: uh-huh well that's great 

533.58 539.96 A: um let me see eight years [laughter] had to think about that for a second [laughter] [sigh] yeah 

535.47 537.02 B: eight years [laughter] 

537.68 542.93 B: [laughter] so we have a golden retriever that's our child we tell everybody 

541.69 551.90 A: oh okay oh sure they can i we had one of those but uh with the three kids he was a little too much [laughter] work for me [laughter] [sigh] they're but they're beautiful animals 

547.95 549.83 B: yeah [laughter] 

550.94 554.59 B: well he she's a golden retriever mix we got her at the animal shelter 

554.05 556.30 A: oh that's nice 

555.17 557.42 B: so yeah she's great 

556.84 562.41 A: uh-huh well there you go you can i there are people who dog walk too i guess that could be a business 

557.67 558.36 B: so 

561.92 565.35 B: yeah that i've heard of that before but i just 

563.63 569.73 A: uh-huh i think that's more a bigger city one too where you'd have to have clientele or you know enough to 

568.61 573.17 B: i don't necc- my personally if i would trust someone to come in your house unless you know 

572.77 575.04 A: that's true yeah 

573.57 576.39 B: you know it's just there's so much crime anymore 

576.00 579.17 A: there is yeah that would be a little bit scarier in 

579.06 583.09 B: yeah [laughter] but the idea's really unique you know 

579.72 580.55 A: so 

582.10 583.19 A: mhm 

583.30 584.09 A: yeah 

584.07 584.93 B: so 

584.53 585.86 A: mhm 

585.22 588.83 B: so are you going to pursue i think your babysitting 

588.80 599.89 A: i not at this time because um the last time it was just i felt like i was spending so much time with the other kids that i didn't spend as much time with my own kids
