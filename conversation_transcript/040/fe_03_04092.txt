0.38 1.72 A: hello 

1.43 3.35 B: (( hello [laughter] )) 

2.66 4.40 A: (( hi i'm loretta )) 

4.53 6.20 B: i'm chris how are you 

6.03 7.48 A: (( good how are you )) 

7.28 9.57 B: good 

9.10 14.85 A: i guess we're supposed to be talking about um a business if we could open up our own business 

14.50 18.19 B: right what kind would you hello i'm sorry 

15.42 16.60 A: yeah 

17.37 19.02 A: yes i'm here 

18.78 22.22 B: oh okay [laughter] thought i'd lost you there what kind of business would you open up 

22.20 30.84 A: oh gosh um [sigh] it would run the gamut of a lot of things i guess especially if money were not an issue 

28.11 28.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

30.34 32.26 B: [laughter] 

31.37 37.40 A: [laughter] you know if money were not an issue i could just sit there and be the boss and tell everybody else what to do so 

37.70 41.32 A: huh what kind of b- how about with you [noise] 

38.78 40.06 B: [noise] very true 

40.74 45.62 B: [noise] well um my husband currently works for a um 

45.71 57.93 B: company called minalto business systems and he's always talking about you know how terrible they do things and how he could go into his own business and take all their competition away [laughter] um they sell and service coffee machines so 

53.68 54.79 A: mhm 

54.89 55.73 A: so 

57.43 64.77 A: oh okay so he already has a background as far as kn- as knowing how to to run a business 

64.87 72.34 B: yes he is the branch manager and so you know he sees all the corporate stuff that goes on and he thinks he could do it better [laughter] 

64.95 66.24 A: (( in a sense )) 

71.85 81.22 A: right right huh well i don't gosh for for me i don't know it'd be kind of hard for me to say 

81.26 89.45 A: um i've got a background in human resources and accounting so i think i could do at least that portion of a business 

86.84 87.84 B: [noise] 

88.77 89.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

89.26 102.27 A: but as far as you know like running the whole thing and going out and you know well money again wouldn't be an issue i suppose um you know i guess just making sure that i'm doing everything as efficiently as possible 

102.33 103.50 B: right 

102.85 107.42 A: that's probably where i would be a little leary um 

107.88 115.29 A: because like i said i've i've had a background in human resources and i know like tons of times friends have said oh you should just open up your own business and 

115.13 129.12 A: you know like do payroll for people and if i could do if i could do it working for somebody so- like your husband does maybe just so i could learn about it and then branch off and do it myself and run it myself at least to get an idea 

129.08 142.42 A: on how to run i think then i could do it but for me to just jump in and say okay this is what i'm gonna do and this is how i'm gonna do it i'm you know i'm not sure that i have all my ducks in a row for something like that 

129.33 130.70 B: right 

142.29 150.48 B: right well uh you know it h- helps to have a background in something but you know i think sometimes some people just get lucky with their businesses too 

149.99 151.82 A: yeah yeah 

150.95 154.26 B: it's the right product for the you know the right market 

154.19 167.46 A: right right well and it's so funny that this is the topic that we're supposed to be talking about because i was just talking to my niece yesterday and i'm not quite sure what she does but i think she does something like a notary public kind of thing 

167.66 176.39 A: and she um just went for her notary test so she was telling me about it and she says oh you should do it and in fact this morning i was researching it 

176.20 186.60 A: a little bit on the internet trying to figure out you know okay who is a notary public around where i live and i couldn't find any i looked in the yellow pages i couldn't find any 

186.70 197.41 A: and i looked to see what it takes to be a notary public in this state and it seems fairly easy so i'm thinking hmm [sigh] you know that could be something 

191.08 192.20 B: [noise] 

195.85 196.78 B: [laughter] 

197.50 198.61 A: big you know 

197.73 202.37 B: so is would that be like your own business you contract out to people to notarize 

202.14 210.09 A: yeah well when i was intere- um looking on the internet there was like um [lipsmack] which i never knew there was um 

210.83 216.28 A: mobile notaries i guess where they can come to your place of business or to your home or something 

216.31 226.62 A: to wherever you need them because whenever i have needed a notary public you know i've always gone to a place and had something notarized you know brought my papers and whatever 

218.59 219.62 B: (( wow )) 

226.64 239.08 A: and i guess there's there's um people who will go to you know places of business or you know and i'm thinking like maybe real estate offices or something if they don't have a notary public available or something 

239.14 243.93 B: yeah that's what i was just thinking when you said that like a lot of people i know the last time we refinanced our home 

239.27 240.14 A: (( so i )) 

243.96 246.70 B: um they came here to do the closing 

246.46 248.17 A: yeah and i think that's 

247.21 249.25 B: so you would need a notary 

249.00 259.33 A: right and i think that's what my niece does 'cause i think she works with a real estate company so she goes you know to um to wherever they need her to go to 

259.46 266.34 A: so when i was looking on the internet you know all i could really see was um mobile 

266.32 279.31 A: 'cause there's like w- a um a website that's like one two three notary mobile or something like that and i couldn't find any for my area so i thought hmm you know that might be something to think about and espec- 

278.54 279.89 B: yeah that could be 

279.83 283.63 A: uh you know especially if it's something that you can kind of 

283.87 288.27 A: you know kind of do on your time kind of schedule it around your schedule 

288.36 289.46 A: so 

289.56 290.59 A: (( i don't )) 

289.92 296.77 B: [noise] right i would definitely wanna open a business that i could [laughter] work around my own schedule [laughter] 

294.57 298.31 A: know right now do you work do you work 

297.44 298.32 B: um 

298.44 300.76 B: well yeah i do you know shopping [laughter] 

300.35 302.48 A: yeah okay [mn] 

302.02 305.55 B: so you know i have ch- i i have a daughter and that's why i do that because i 

305.44 317.27 B: you know wanna be able to [noise] be there when she needs me for things at school and be able to you know go to whatever events that she has going on but then also you know while she's at school i have a lot of free time 

317.00 318.64 A: right right 

318.29 324.61 B: so any type of business that would allow me to you know work around her hours and you know kind of 

325.31 326.39 A: right 

325.46 333.03 B: you know like i can i can do a lot early mornings and like evenings unfortunately you know not not a lot of things are open at those times [laughter] 

331.92 344.87 A: right right and you know and it's funny because like sometimes when i've looked in the newspaper for positions they've got like third position and i'm thinking what the heck is third position 

344.72 354.00 A: and it's like i think a third shift it's like from eleven to eight you know it's it's like the time when you're supp- you 

353.94 361.61 A: you're ending your shift when you're supposed to be getting your family ready to go out the door and go to school and you know pack lunches and whatever 

361.42 362.66 B: right 

361.80 366.69 A: so it you know there's nothing that that can really work like that so 

366.79 372.93 A: running a business out of your home or you know where you're kind of the boss would be nice where you could just say 

372.88 384.43 A: either here's my hours that i'm going to work or um you know here's the people that are g- [mn] i'm gonna have working for me and then you can assign the jobs that would be nice too 

384.10 389.62 B: right right just kinda be like the supervisor manager [laughter] who can just you know 

388.07 389.05 A: right 

389.69 391.89 B: not do any of the work [laughter] 

391.03 398.84 A: exactly i have a i have a friend who has uh her own um sh- carpet shampoo business and she and her husband started it years ago 

398.75 413.57 A: and it's pretty much them and sometimes they have one person working for them and i guess it keeps them really really busy but i always tease her husband because you know they do work like six days a week because it is really basically the two of them 

413.51 419.64 A: and i always tease him that every month when it's the employee of the month his picture just keeps going up again 

419.57 421.72 B: (( oh [laughter] yeah )) 

419.94 423.93 A: because you know it's them and that's basically it 

423.75 425.34 B: right 

423.95 424.91 A: so 

425.62 433.68 B: well and i think that you know if you have your own business you you do work more i- you know anybody that i know that has their own business works more hours than people who actually work for a company 

425.79 426.50 A: but 

432.92 438.16 A: right but then again you have more vested in it and you wanna make it be successful 

437.34 439.10 B: right right 

438.59 449.48 A: too you know you don't have that um that attitude you know of [noise] of these people don't know what their doing or you know whatever like that 

449.20 450.81 B: right right and you 

449.93 450.89 A: so 

450.91 461.45 A: y- you you know you you know that [noise] your time is definitely your money and you want to make it work and you only get the most out of your time that you can 

451.09 452.25 B: yeah 

461.60 464.00 B: right that's true and you know that 

461.66 462.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

464.09 476.22 B: every you know ounce of effort you pour into it that turns into some kind of profit is gonna go towards you and not towards some company that you know your paycheck's gonna be the same no matter how much effort you put into it 

475.44 478.27 A: right right exactly 

478.09 492.36 A: yeah and i think that's why sometimes you know like my husband he works for a large company and you know he feels like [noise] and we've probably all been there he feels like you know he's putting out so much effort and the guy next to him is putting out minimal effort 

492.24 502.79 A: and you know they're getting paid the same or getting treated the same and it's like and you know and then you i can understand why [noise] people get that attitude of well why should i work so hard [noise] you know this guy working 

502.10 503.64 B: right 

502.95 503.90 A: (( hard )) 

504.35 505.41 A: (( [noise] so )) 

505.86 513.67 B: yeah i think when you have your own business you work a little harder because you know that you know you're you're it if you don't work nobody else is going to [laughter] 

512.51 524.16 A: [noise] exactly exactly and you know that you and i think that once you get involved in it you also know you know what you need to do or how much you need to do 

524.13 532.13 A: in order to get the amount of money you know that you need to either make it float or you know to start turning a profit too 

532.03 534.03 B: right right 

532.75 544.27 A: start gauging you know well like with my friend with her carpet cleaning business you know we need to do x. amount of carpet cleaning a week to at least cover you know the cost of 

544.20 549.94 A: the product or the equipment and gas to get there and all of that 

550.02 552.99 A: and then x. amount to make a profit 

553.07 557.89 B: right that's true that's true and plus then they have bills on top of that their own personal 

557.63 559.62 A: right right 

558.51 562.75 B: so 'cause they're working six days a week they can't have another source of income 

562.36 563.95 A: exactly 

564.07 565.55 A: [noise] so 

568.12 569.60 A: [noise] are you or aren't you 

570.26 570.92 A: (( okay )) 

571.00 572.92 A: that was my [laughter] 

571.34 572.66 B: (( yeah )) 

573.25 584.44 B: yes and then children make it even more difficult i m- i you know even working at home and uh you know when when school the school year is in i i do just fine it's you know those days that they're off and oh i just feel like 

580.94 582.04 A: mhm 

584.25 589.24 B: uh maybe i do need a office to go to [laughter] some peace and quiet [laughter] 

586.93 587.77 A: (( you know )) 

588.49 599.89 A: i agree with you well um because i have worked out of the home and i've done some book keeping and i have to do it in the middle of the night when everybody's asleep
