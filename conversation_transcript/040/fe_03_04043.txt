0.61 2.79 A: hi my name is three 

2.24 3.41 B: (( hello )) 

4.47 5.47 B: hello 

4.64 6.81 A: hi hi i'm three 

7.17 8.35 B: what's your name 

8.23 9.21 A: three 

9.54 10.54 B: three 

10.21 11.96 A: yeah what's yours 

11.19 13.77 B: this is this is diana how are you tonight 

13.41 14.75 A: good how are you 

14.64 16.02 B: oh good good 

16.81 20.66 B: so we have a a hypothetical question what would you do 

21.53 25.11 B: if you got a million dollars to leave the united states 

24.92 27.03 A: yeah i think question 

28.05 29.95 B: yeah so you'd go for it 

30.45 31.39 A: um 

31.55 36.50 A: yeah i think one thing is i look at it from a long term perspective 

36.56 40.86 A: so uh i'll probably be working for maybe thirty years 

41.06 50.39 A: so in that period of time there's not a whole lot of money for the wallet but how do you know it's like it's like thirty thousand dollars per year 

47.00 47.94 B: uh-huh 

50.47 54.78 A: so i think in terms of money it's too much 

54.96 62.46 A: so uh one million dollars wouldn't make a lot of difference to my decision whether i stay in the u._s. or leave 

62.88 66.30 A: i mean there are other things that would make me leave or stay 

66.40 69.30 A: but a million dollars is not one of them 

70.14 72.10 B: well a million were you born here 

71.91 74.01 A: no i'm not 

73.89 75.37 B: where where you born 

75.23 76.76 A: i was in india 

78.67 82.52 B: and you wouldn't take a million dollars to to leave the united states 

82.04 82.97 A: no 

83.59 87.20 A: i don't know if i will stay in the united states or not 

83.99 84.61 B: (( mm )) 

87.50 88.49 B: (( mhm )) 

88.06 93.06 A: (( but uh i leave it will be for other reasons not for a million dollars )) 

93.07 94.00 B: uh-huh 

95.65 98.10 B: yeah that's interesting 

98.01 98.92 A: [laughter] 

99.35 101.69 A: (( yeah how 'bout you )) 

102.01 102.91 B: well 

102.92 106.46 B: i would be curious i would have to think about it [sigh] 

106.66 110.66 B: for a while i mean i was i was born here so i don't know 

110.87 117.66 B: about living anywhere else although in my mind i have traveled the world through my love of reading 

118.42 121.77 B: you know so i've always been interested in how other people 

122.40 125.91 B: live and survive and and i'm able to make 

126.06 128.63 B: i think some comparisons 

129.20 130.00 A: mm 

129.98 131.06 B: so 

131.60 135.92 B: living in another country would be okay but you would need to be very wealthy 

136.60 137.86 B: i think 

137.56 143.91 A: yeah i mean what if you had to go canada it's not a whole lot different from the u._s. right [laughter] 

142.79 145.05 B: [laughter] 

145.19 148.70 B: yeah we could always ask for you know several million 

149.08 150.05 A: yeah 

149.20 151.20 B: but a million won't really 

153.10 155.77 B: do it in a lot of cases 

155.27 158.55 A: (( yeah )) 

158.27 160.39 B: yeah although i've never worked for 

161.06 164.45 B: any large amount of money or anything like that it's just been 

165.71 167.95 B: whatever my life has brought me so 

167.99 179.43 A: yeah in fact i had an interesting experience i came to the u._s. as a graduate student and uh i used to live on like uh some eight thousand dollars a year 

171.05 172.15 B: (( mhm )) 

180.09 192.97 A: and then uh yeah and then i graduated and i got a graduate degree and uh uh now i get paid a lot more than that and you know overall my lifestyle didn't change at all 

180.48 181.44 B: how many 

192.90 199.95 A: you know i it's like i got probably like [mn] uh a lot more money now that i'm working and with a graduate degree 

200.05 206.38 A: and it was very surprising i have a better car and uh but you know in my if you ask me am i happier 

206.44 210.73 A: uh my answer is no i'm not happier than i was when i was in school 

210.84 216.90 A: so that makes me wonder if i if i'm richer uh it doesn't necessarily mean i'm happier 

217.09 219.80 A: in fact i was happiest when i was in school 

219.90 224.06 A: and since then you know my level of happiness has been going down 

220.16 221.21 B: (( mhm )) 

224.37 232.88 A: so uh that's that's what bothers me the most uh i don't know if it is about being in the u._s. or being outside the u._s. 

233.24 237.39 A: but uh i think more money is not going to help me 

238.74 242.47 B: yeah 'cause what would a million dollars do for ya in iraq you know 

242.93 244.43 B: [laughter] 

244.05 247.30 A: (( yeah [laughter] yeah )) 

246.72 254.42 B: i mean i i just you think about the the statistically of how many what would be your chance of being in the 

254.63 260.72 B: the more than half of the iraqi uh neighbors who who beg for their living you know 

260.71 261.63 A: mm 

261.05 261.93 B: um 

261.92 263.16 A: (( yeah mm mm )) 

262.52 263.71 B: i just can't 

264.07 268.03 B: i just can't really imagine that but then if somebody you know 

269.09 272.27 B: if the balance of of power is is so 

273.08 274.00 B: um 

274.80 278.10 B: off center as it is or was there 

278.21 279.41 B: (( [lipsmack] uh )) 

280.17 284.60 B: where true poverty can exist and and be a norm for people 

285.44 286.33 B: um 

286.10 287.37 A: (( yeah )) 

287.00 290.44 B: i don't know what you you know like in this country i don't think that you can 

291.27 293.30 B: stay poor unless uh 

293.81 297.42 B: you really design yourself to be poor 

298.88 300.75 B: you know what i'm saying you know 

299.16 303.31 A: mm yeah yeah i india's a democratic country 

303.38 310.88 A: so i have never lived outside a democracy but to me it's very tough you know living in a non democratic country you know where 

306.53 307.35 B: (( mhm )) 

311.17 313.82 A: where you are not the person who makes the decision 

313.92 315.89 A: (( that is very unnerving )) 

316.99 321.23 A: you know i i probably could never go to a country that's not democratic 

317.36 318.17 B: well 

321.71 322.74 B: (( mhm )) 

323.06 326.59 A: because it's like grown and it's become a way of my life 

329.41 333.05 B: well that's you know the whole design of this country was 

333.22 335.81 B: people arrived here to get away from 

336.37 338.77 B: you know oppressive society 

338.21 340.46 A: (( mm yeah mm [noise] )) 

339.04 341.64 B: which uh prevented them from 

341.92 342.89 B: uh 

343.66 348.45 B: basically getting your head up and up and above over the crowd of of people that 

348.48 353.03 B: were at the bottom you know you were just stifling there was no room to 

353.47 355.78 B: to live and and not um 

357.93 361.27 B: and not have you know have a future for yourself 

361.46 363.98 B: or choices through a democracy 

365.04 367.43 B: my um my mother's father 

368.32 373.41 B: was a young greek man and in his culture before world war one 

374.27 378.64 B: they he was promised at birth to who he was going to marry when he grew up 

378.57 379.41 A: (( mm mm mm )) 

379.18 383.52 B: and he refused that when he got to that age and he left greece and he joined 

384.02 387.22 B: the united states army which happened to be going into 

387.77 390.35 B: war through germany up into russia 

390.36 391.28 A: (( wow mm )) 

390.51 391.58 B: and he met 

391.62 393.53 B: uh a young russian girl 

394.39 395.55 B: and um 

395.95 397.51 B: fell in love and 

398.29 405.92 B: [sigh] then uh the fighting got really bad and he had to escape up into siberia and he had to stay with his army unit 

406.03 407.20 A: wow 

406.85 407.81 B: and 

408.56 420.10 B: so he had to wait until he got permission to go back across army lines to and which he did he finally got permission and he walked eight thousand miles across that barrier to go find 

420.32 421.42 B: his wife 

420.39 421.85 A: (( eight thousand miles )) 

421.82 422.84 B: (( mhm )) 

422.80 423.92 A: wow 

423.08 424.25 B: he walked 

424.47 427.31 A: [laughter] that must've taken a long time 

424.96 426.06 B: and 

426.70 428.85 B: [laughter] well yeah but we're talking 

429.04 431.52 B: you know war time uh 

432.13 438.90 B: siberia which is not really populated you know so there wasn't a lot of help and it's really his language or people 

438.61 440.40 A: mhm 

439.46 446.96 B: and uh it took him ten and a half months to find her and and get her and her baby out of there and 

447.18 448.09 B: (( um )) 

448.38 451.78 B: they got help from the uh the red cross 

452.15 453.19 A: (( mhm )) 

452.55 455.32 B: got them out of the country and they ended up um 

456.18 460.85 B: going uh getting out and going to china and manila and then they finally ended up in uh 

460.96 462.42 B: san francisco 

462.62 464.38 A: oh wow [laughter] 

462.83 466.05 B: where they started their family life et cetera 

464.73 465.87 A: (( yeah mm )) 

465.89 466.87 A: mm 

467.33 468.23 B: so 

467.53 474.88 A: yeah yeah that's one thing about the u._s. that i really like that it doesn't matter where you're from or who you are 

471.04 471.95 B: uh-huh 

475.27 478.79 A: it's like your future is controlled by you 

478.72 479.67 B: uh-huh 

479.32 484.56 A: because back in my country if you are born to a family that are aristocratic 

484.87 486.04 A: your life is 

486.40 491.57 A: but if you're born to a family that is not you know you don't have a lot of options in life 

491.80 501.75 A: but you know in the u._s. the way i see it i see people you know it doesn't matter where you are from what you are doing or it doesn't matter about your family or where you stand in the society 

501.78 503.66 A: (( like you have all the option )) 

501.92 503.04 B: so you you're 

503.58 506.70 B: you mean like case through system you can't get out of 

506.89 512.80 A: yeah the thing is though uh i i mean i came from a privileged uh class 

512.99 517.95 A: so i didn't see the bad side of it but i do know that it exists 

513.15 513.94 B: mhm 

518.75 532.09 A: and you you know it's really hard because i look at a friend of mine he's as capable intellectually he's as motivated but he simply does not have the same uh same kind of opportunities available to him 

526.61 527.75 B: mhm 

532.18 535.31 A: just because he was born in a family different from mine 

532.20 533.18 B: uh-huh 

537.14 542.97 A: one thing that i see in the u._s. is that is complete i think that's very good and it's kind of 

545.06 546.20 B: (( [laughter] )) 

546.31 549.68 B: i well that's a very striking difference you know is is uh 

550.17 555.66 B: you you know you can't really explain it in a in another way that would be as uh 

555.77 557.35 B: significant 

557.96 558.85 A: mm 

558.59 559.85 B: and i uh 

560.46 564.03 B: i don't know i don't know if it takes a million dollars 

564.68 571.78 B: i think i'll stay where i'm at but i'm i'm an old woman now and i don't really want to go out and adventure i might've when i was younger 

571.96 572.87 A: mm 

573.23 579.60 B: and you know so your age is is uh a lot to say about it and how connected you are where you're at 

579.61 581.19 A: (( mm yeah )) 

580.29 582.64 B: would make a difference i think also 

582.57 583.55 A: mm 

583.71 584.95 B: so you'd agree 

584.86 593.34 A: yeah yeah i agree but this reminds me of the movie uh there was a movie right where a guy is offered a million dollars to 

589.61 590.45 B: uh-huh 

593.38 595.56 A: spend the night with somebody's wife 

595.64 596.94 B: oh yeah 

596.41 599.64 A: [laughter] i forgot the name of the movie
