18.82 19.89 B: wow 

19.91 20.93 B: crazy 

20.13 26.56 A: so and that's that this always gives me the big idea for my own business travel agent 

24.72 25.66 B: (( yes )) 

26.07 27.40 B: oh yeah 

26.57 37.40 A: and bringing um the people into florida and then the most important part of it taking them to the beach and being with them the whole day at the beach 

30.08 31.02 B: uh-huh 

34.62 35.89 B: mhm 

37.01 38.87 B: yeah that sounds good 

38.91 50.94 B: i think i would open like a video store because i like entertainment you know and so people come there and everybody's usually happy because they wanna get a movie and sit down and relax it's not a stressful job i don't think 

42.31 43.34 A: uh-huh 

51.15 55.74 B: and i think i would be pretty good at it because you know i'm kind of organized and i 

54.77 55.82 A: mhm 

55.66 66.33 B: and i you know i make sure everything you know i i worry about the w- i would worry about the workers and talk to them and everything like that 'cause they say if the boss is happy with their workers the workers will be happy with them 

66.59 67.87 A: (( that's right )) 

67.22 69.94 B: so that's that's what i believe 

69.37 79.58 A: yep i agree i agree with that two hundred percent because that's the main idea of mine going to the beach i enjoy going to the beach in florida not to the gulf beach to the 

76.65 77.57 B: uh-huh 

79.82 80.38 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

80.43 81.27 A: (( or )) 

81.37 83.15 A: uh going down the keys 

82.76 83.66 B: uh-huh 

83.31 84.77 A: i enjoy that 

84.20 85.45 B: yeah 

84.84 87.48 A: so if you like your job whatever you do 

87.20 89.42 B: mhm yeah 

87.76 90.06 A: yeah you you will do big 

90.07 91.62 A: (( uh doing a great job )) 

91.28 97.01 B: [laughter] yeah and if you're making other people happy it makes it all m- that much better right 

96.38 97.79 A: mhm 

97.11 109.99 B: yep so people will come and they come back and come back and you've got good business and i mean you don't have to charge a lot of money as long as the people are happy they'll keep coming back you have a few amount of customers but as long as they keep coming back then you've gotta good income 

109.61 122.56 A: exactly exactly that's what i'm thinking too you know if you look through and see what they are charging sometimes for whatever you want yeah they charge a lot they have five customers nobody comes back 

110.23 112.00 B: [laughter] 

112.82 113.72 B: yeah 

117.52 118.95 B: mhm yeah 

119.04 120.05 B: yeah 

120.80 121.78 B: (( mhm )) 

122.33 123.26 B: yeah 

122.64 127.44 A: i would like to have two hundred and coming back yeah 

124.36 125.71 B: [laughter] 

125.94 128.42 B: yeah that sounds good 

128.01 128.96 A: (( you know )) 

128.45 139.85 B: that sounds really good to me 'cause like there's stores over here there's like so many fruit and vegetable stores and there's this one store it's so expensive it's the most expensive on the avenue and you can walk two blocks and go to a different one 

139.76 154.20 B: and she has it's never crowded you go in there and it's like maybe one person in there every time and it's like ridiculous she'd rather charge high prices and only have five customers a day than to lower her p- lower her prices and have like twenty customers a day 

154.04 162.89 B: 'cause the cheapest fruit stand is like two three blocks away it's packed every time you go in there you've got to stand on a long line because they have such great prices 

158.71 159.54 A: (( mhm )) 

162.25 164.25 A: exactly exactly 

162.96 171.44 B: you know i just don't understand some people they're just like greedy all they want is money but you can't you know you can't do that all the time you've got to make your customers today you 

171.09 174.06 A: (( exactly exactly i agree i agree )) 

171.73 172.63 B: (( know )) 

173.49 182.02 B: so i don't know you know that that would be the best thing i guess entertainment i mean it's what is it like a dollar two dollars now anyway you rent a movie the whole family 

182.05 190.22 B: you try going out to a movie theater forget it it's like seven fifty eight fifty nine dollars just to go to the movie for one person 

187.86 188.59 A: yep 

189.80 190.87 A: yep 

190.23 200.10 B: so if you're a family of four which i am how the heck are ya gonna do that you know it's like it'll cost you a hundred dollars to go from here to the movies which is ten blocks away 

194.46 196.10 A: exactly exactly 

197.20 197.76 A: (( [cough] )) 

199.71 200.74 A: (( yep yep )) 

200.17 210.00 B: you know it's ridiculous and the prices inside when you buy the candy my god a candy bar is like two fifty when you could buy it in the store next door like fifty cents 

209.60 211.26 A: (( yep yep )) 

210.01 216.54 B: you know it's terrible and they're allowed to get away with it you know it's like legal robbery [laughter] 

212.73 213.72 A: (( yep )) 

215.31 219.92 A: yeah of course of course that's the same if you go to the feed park you know i i live in near orlando 

219.51 220.53 B: mhm 

219.94 227.12 A: if you go the feed park whatever you want of the seven we have that's fif- that's over fifty bucks one day per person 

223.48 224.43 B: mhm 

226.59 227.99 B: yeah i know 

227.67 233.54 A: so if you go to the feed park okay by myself i live in florida it's not so expensive for us we have the 

233.61 243.36 A: but the tourists they come down four four family four p- a family four persons they they pay at least for something to eat for two hundred three hundred bucks a day 

235.42 236.32 B: mhm 

242.81 256.68 B: [laughter] it's crazy i'm telling you it's terrible you know you can't really live it's gonna be like uh um a luxury you know to go on a vacation in the near future you know what i'm saying because everything is so expensive 

244.99 245.69 A: (( yeah )) 

247.37 248.49 A: yeah 

254.34 255.45 A: (( yes it is )) 

256.03 259.14 A: yes it is and but but what i'd like to do is 

256.65 257.82 B: (( yeah )) 

259.55 264.99 A: to find something to get a real good vacation at a reasonable price 

260.90 261.96 B: mhm 

262.64 263.70 B: mhm 

264.67 265.66 B: mhm

271.39 275.03 B: (( [laughter] )) 

272.46 274.04 A: i keep you in mind 

274.44 276.10 A: because it's very realistic 

276.28 280.06 A: i'm talking about this idea with some friends in mexico 

279.22 280.77 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

280.41 283.28 A: and they want to open a travel agency in mexico 

282.84 283.75 B: mhm 

283.36 286.00 A: and a travel agency here in orlando 

285.66 286.54 B: (( yes )) 

286.77 290.10 A: [sigh] so if we have it i keep you in mind definitely 

289.94 292.29 B: [mn] you think you're up you're able to do it though 

292.05 293.50 A: it looks like 

292.89 293.86 B: uh-huh 

293.65 296.13 A: it looks like they they wanna do 

296.25 300.80 B: yeah so before the year is over you mean or next year [laughter] 

296.72 297.35 A: (( it )) 

298.87 304.07 A: i hope so i hope so by the next within the next couple of months i hope if 

302.73 308.34 B: wow that sounds great especially by that time it'll be the summer time and that's when everybody goes 

307.73 310.34 A: exactly exactly 

308.51 309.49 B: yeah 

309.71 315.88 B: i've been to orlando many times before in the past but i haven't gone anywhere for a couple of years now so 

314.96 315.93 A: uh-huh 

315.98 327.89 B: yeah it's just you know too expensive even to fly my god to fly if you're lucky to get a ninety nine dollars one way you know and they they charge for children starting at three years old you've gotta pay 

322.94 324.06 A: yeah that's right 

327.61 328.45 A: oh 

328.14 329.62 B: (( a full price )) 

329.23 330.04 A: oh 

329.74 331.05 B: isn't that terrible 

330.64 342.97 A: oh they are crazy now they are crazy now and everybody's yelling about oh no i have no money i have no money i'm so poor i have to to cut my employees and stuff like that if you go in look into the place they are there's nobody in 

331.44 332.59 B: [laughter] 

342.78 344.17 B: yeah i know 

343.95 357.76 B: it's so ridiculous they're always going to government oh give us some more money so that we could bail us out and everything like that then you have a couple of airlines like jet blue and stuff like that and they charge low prices how are they able to charge such low prices and then the bigger 

357.58 361.61 B: companies say oh we can't we need money from the from the government 

361.56 364.53 B: you know what i really think the government should do is they should be 

364.36 377.87 B: revise and and give money to like amtrak and the train rails i mean that would be much better than to keep on giving it to the airlines and stuff like that they make so much money and they're always crying we don't have no money you've gotta give us more bail us out 

368.29 369.52 A: exactly 

369.56 370.80 A: exactly 

377.47 378.37 A: (( yep )) 

377.73 391.85 B: but if they would if the government would give to like amtrak and to you know like all the little these trains they would open up i i think that would be much better than flying you'd get to see everything on the ground you know you you don't have to worry you know that much about anything 

388.01 389.44 A: yeah that's very interesting 

391.81 403.46 B: and you just go here and you go there and you can see beautiful country america is a beautiful country you know but the government is always like going for the airlines why do they need it they make so much money 

396.68 397.68 A: definitely 

402.79 404.91 A: no they they have a big lobby 

404.50 405.93 B: it's terrible 

405.52 415.60 A: yeah they have a big lobby and they are lobbying far and down and up and where and so they got the money you know i come from europe and in europe you have a lot of trains 

410.48 411.65 B: mhm 

412.03 413.94 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

415.19 416.36 B: mhm 

415.69 421.55 A: yeah so you sit in a train and you see the scenery you see everything and you can enjoy the ride 

420.95 422.41 B: mhm 

421.36 433.22 A: yeah okay that's one thing that's positive if you go by plane it's fast if you go by amtrak for example from europe down to florida i guess this will be a twenty four hour ride or something like that you know 

425.28 426.61 B: yeah 

429.41 430.70 B: mhm 

432.11 434.08 B: yeah yeah 

433.34 436.99 A: you lose a lot of time but uh 

434.48 435.46 B: yeah 

436.10 442.60 B: well that's why i say they they should put their money into the train system you know the cross country train system 

440.30 441.19 A: yeah 

442.38 452.38 B: and a lot more people i'm sure would go on that you know because now w- what had happened at nine eleven so many people don't wanna go fly i'd rather be down on the ground so i know you know 

452.34 465.96 B: but you know they they they crashed in the plane and stuff like that so then they were afraid so if you if they give the money to the trains i'm sure there would be such a revitalization people would be going all over the place but i don't know why they don't do that 

463.97 464.74 A: (( yes )) 

465.34 470.90 A: so let's so let's open a travel agency let's talk to amtrak let's get some good prices and let's do it 

470.30 474.74 B: yeah it sounds good and i'm sure the government would be happy if you 

472.21 472.99 A: yeah 

474.54 487.89 B: like say the first year if you're so successful then you go to the government and say look i'm this i'm successful and i'm doing this why don't you give us money instead of giving it to the airlines and and if you could prove that you were successful they they most likely they will 

483.29 484.36 A: exactly 

487.46 494.51 A: of course of course that's my that's the intention that's that's the idea to give the people something they can afford 

488.14 489.10 B: (( you know )) 

489.94 492.15 B: yeah like yeah 

493.96 495.87 B: mhm yeah 

494.45 502.70 A: yeah and that they can go on vacation they can can relax because on the other hand if people are relaxed they are better at work 

502.18 512.70 B: yeah yeah and but the only thing that's not good about amtrak is like they charge you like say if you want to sleep on it the sleeper cars they charge you for a rail fare plus a sleeper care 

503.94 504.73 A: yeah 

512.66 513.59 A: (( [mn] )) 

512.91 515.01 B: and that's a little expensive 

514.37 525.28 A: yeah if you go by yourself yes but i i think if you go with a travel agent it's the same as if you go to an airline with a travel agent you can get a price because you say okay i will try to get 

520.73 521.72 B: mhm 

522.35 523.32 B: yeah 

525.70 530.71 A: let's just put put a number a thousand passengers a year or two thousand passengers a year 

530.46 531.40 B: mhm 

530.74 533.96 A: yeah you should you should be able to get a price 

533.89 534.83 B: yeah 

534.07 536.22 A: and i know from the airline industry 

536.05 537.12 B: (( mhm )) 

536.52 538.97 A: yeah you you get half price or less 

538.74 546.40 B: yeah yeah then they they have the frequent flyer miles and stuff like that people don't even wanna fly any more they're too afraid 

540.04 541.31 A: so 

544.94 545.74 A: yeah 

546.09 548.02 A: and amtrak has the same system no 

547.90 550.26 B: uh the frequent flyers 

549.64 552.29 A: frequent right system or something like that yeah 

551.46 553.56 B: (( i i don't really know i don't know )) 

552.68 554.11 A: yes they do they do 

553.92 556.27 B: oh well that's good 

555.06 555.99 A: (( they do )) 

556.13 561.31 A: they have a let's let's call it let's call it mileage program yeah 

559.52 560.67 B: mhm 

560.78 569.56 B: yeah well i really enjoy i i took an amtrak a couple of times to different places and i really enjoyed it i mean you sit there you relax it's clean 

569.36 579.77 B: the people are nice you know there's enough room to move around not like when you're sitting in a little airplane you're like you you can't move because you're like so squished in there's like three people in a row 

579.59 584.72 B: and they they make those seats so small and i'm not a big person i'm small and i'm still so squished you know 

584.20 586.06 A: yeah exactly exactly 

584.68 593.01 B: but at least you go on the amtrak those seats are like so wide you could like fall you know get get stuck in them that's how big they are you could sleep on one 

592.80 593.85 A: uh-huh 

592.93 599.89 B: and it's it's really great i so enjoy it but i don't know for some reason the government they do pay a little bit of
