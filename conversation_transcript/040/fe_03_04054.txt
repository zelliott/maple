103.76 105.84 A: [laughter] 

104.81 107.08 B: um how did you start your business 

107.11 115.75 A: well i started mine because i want to stay at home with my uh twins and uh they're now eight and i started back in ninety three 

111.91 112.76 B: oh 

115.51 116.36 B: okay 

116.44 123.62 A: so that's when i started now i tell ya i've also thought about wanting to do something else and that's a long time i looked at doing hypnotherapy 

123.60 124.63 B: oh wow 

125.74 127.38 A: yeah i thought it'd be neat 

126.20 127.59 B: that'd be awesome 

127.47 141.93 A: yeah that's what i thought and [mn] and i've been institutes where you can learn and get certified in a fairly short period of time uh i just haven't done it because i you know uh i don't know just haven't got to it but i think i'd be good at it because i like talking to people 

134.21 135.16 B: really 

141.66 142.55 B: mhm 

142.02 152.27 A: i like helping uh but at the same time it doesn't cost a lot to get started in such a business i mean uh like for the state of florida i checked on the licensing the license is minimal 

152.14 152.93 B: right 

152.23 158.51 A: uh but the cost of uh of getting through the course is somewhere between fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars 

157.96 158.93 B: mhm 

158.32 172.51 A: and uh you know from as far as advertising uh i believe if i advertised in some of the local papers to start off with and made myself available to doctors and and so forth as an add on to their business to their 

172.30 175.15 A: practice then i think i might be able to do well 

174.83 180.06 B: oh definitely definitely you'd do well so i'm guessing you do well in the business you have now also 

180.11 181.00 A: pardon 

180.76 183.82 B: i'm guessing that you are doing well in the business you have now 

183.80 191.63 A: i'm doing okay i took a break for about nine months and helped a friend with his computer store and that was a mistake you should not leave your business for nine months 

191.18 192.06 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

191.98 193.35 A: [laughter] 

192.21 194.36 B: how many employees do you have working for you 

194.36 195.65 A: just me 

195.05 196.01 B: just you 

195.93 199.00 A: oh yeah see the nice thing about my business i'm a note broker 

198.87 199.69 B: okay 

199.07 205.46 A: the nice thing about my business i don't need anybody basically somebody takes back a note uh not the let's 

206.31 211.68 A: say you take back a note on a house they've sold okay and they're carrying the paper their stuff owner financing 

208.45 209.29 B: okay 

211.31 212.14 B: okay 

211.49 222.09 A: well after a while they real- they sometimes think to themselves hey i don't really need to do this and i don't wanna do it and they wanna cash out they get all their money now and what i do is i broker those notes to investors 

221.91 222.85 B: (( oh okay )) 

224.19 230.96 A: so that's how i make a living uh currently like i said i just think it'd be nice uh you know mostly i work out of my home so 

230.76 239.20 A: that helps because i spend time with my twins ever since they were like uh oh let's see i started in ninety four october they were about four months old 

238.61 241.01 B: are they boys are they girls or one of each 

240.30 244.62 A: they're girls and they're mean i never thought girls would be mean 

241.55 242.47 B: oh 

245.90 248.83 A: but they are they're so mean [laughter] 

248.12 249.51 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

250.62 259.24 A: but you know like i said it's been fun and i've been home and nobody's had to tell me about well you know johnny took his first steps today or you know laurie 

259.48 272.56 A: towards the neighbor took their first step and they uh and so forth i mean i was there i mean i got to watch them take their first steps i got to watch 'em you know uh say the first words i got to give 'em a bath i got to play with 'em you know 

272.42 274.62 A: and so forth uh 

273.31 276.30 B: that is definitely worth starting your own business at home 

276.29 280.03 A: yeah i mean you know how how can you c- you know what kind of 

279.97 293.17 A: uh i guess for me you know a lot of people want to get rich and be millionaires uh they wouldn't like that but for me i can't substitute a price for that 'cause this is my second set of children my others are twenty eight and twenty seven 

293.01 293.87 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

293.45 300.46 A: and i was always working i mean gone gone gone all the time when they were growing up and i said it wasn't gonna happen this time 

297.86 298.79 B: mhm 

301.11 305.00 B: what did you do before you started your this business like what were you doing before 

303.86 305.73 A: uh i was in computers 

305.48 306.44 B: (( oh okay )) 

306.56 316.64 A: i actually did computer consulting uh i worked for a company and did a lot of traveling and so forth and that's like what i said it wasn't unusual for me to leave at six and come home at midnight 

316.05 317.10 B: oh wow 

317.02 320.23 A: and you know i was overseas quite a bit uh you know 

320.51 324.74 A: three or four weeks in europe uh one time i spent six weeks in egypt 

324.71 325.45 B: hm 

325.04 334.21 A: so you know it's just i i was gone a lot and that's the way i always have been ever since uh the older kids you know uh i was always working uh and gone 

334.15 335.19 B: right 

335.27 342.67 A: and i just didn't wanna do it this time and now that they're eight though i sometimes feel like i would like to be gone [laughter] 

341.21 343.95 B: (( [laughter] )) 

344.53 354.97 A: i was glad when school started anyhow but no if you did uh you know would you run it out of your own office uh uh would you carry generalized property casually 

355.76 356.68 A: life 

355.79 356.88 B: um 

357.91 359.81 B: i think i would like to do 

359.95 361.09 B: property 

361.56 362.54 A: property 

362.28 363.16 B: yeah 

363.44 364.39 A: okay 

364.08 375.82 B: i think like what my dad does is he's just an independent he does um car insurance house insurance i think he might do a little bit of life but not too much and he just goes through other companies so 

370.79 371.83 A: (( right uh-huh )) 

376.49 378.43 A: okay he's an independent agent then 

378.64 379.42 B: yes 

379.53 380.42 A: okay 

380.52 394.17 A: well that's a nice life because you've got those capital agents that uh are like and bay farm and farmers but actually farmers there's a lot of independence there but you know what i'm saying a lot of the capital ones that they only recommend their products and that's all they can recommend 

389.60 390.42 B: yeah 

393.57 399.54 B: yeah no i like it how my dad does it because he get people quotes from different companies and try to get them the best deal possible 

399.68 405.64 B: and i like being able to do that and i think that's why he has such a good relationship is that he can help people out like that and they really think that he's 

399.82 400.85 A: excellent 

405.76 407.40 B: doing them a favor so 

407.76 409.35 A: now what was your degree in 

407.80 409.15 B: i like that part of it 

409.78 411.88 B: my degree is actually in biology 

411.94 412.89 B: so 

412.09 413.03 A: okay 

412.94 416.98 B: i was going to go to med school but now i'm actually looking into pharmaceutical sales 

417.09 419.15 A: oh that's a well paid job 

418.66 420.86 B: yeah so um 

421.05 423.07 B: (( yeah so that's what i'm going to do but )) 

423.69 428.79 B: that'd be a fun business to start as well to have my own company and that but that might take a while [laughter] 

428.67 440.24 A: [laughter] do you think your company could provide people to uh work for pharmaceuticals like the you know like the like so many people are doing leasing their employees you know what i'm talking about 

438.02 438.92 B: mhm 

439.66 441.78 B: not especially no i don't 

441.11 446.66 A: well they don't actually have their employees work for them the employees work for a third party company and then the third party 

446.59 457.80 A: company provides all the benefits to the employees and so forth they take their contract negotiation and then they provide 'em to other companies on a need as basis and that's uh and they're called leasing employees you know 

457.81 469.84 A: is like the temporary agencies for lower end jobs but the higher jobs there's a lot of c- not c._e._o.s but middle management people that are actually leased into the company and so when that job ends they move on to another job 

466.59 467.55 B: really 

469.75 470.47 B: hm 

473.20 478.60 A: so i guess that uh helps provide the company a lot of of uh of uh 

478.73 487.09 A: what do i want to say uh savings okay 'cause they don't have to have the the people necessary as far as running you know resources at a high level 

485.78 486.61 B: yeah 

486.97 488.00 B: oh right 

488.23 494.12 A: so would you think maybe you could start a company at where you provide the people that are specialized in pharmaceutical sales 

495.69 497.11 B: (( yeah i may be do that )) 

497.28 499.02 A: that'd be cool wouldn't it 

498.41 499.66 B: that would be cool 

499.57 501.21 A: [laughter] 

500.35 503.62 B: i've never heard of leasing that's really that's interesting to me 

504.10 506.08 A: well do you ever get on the internet 

506.10 507.51 B: would i work on the internet 

507.40 509.05 A: no do you ever get on the internet 

508.44 509.80 B: oh yeah all the time 

509.55 511.28 A: okay do you ever use google 

511.50 514.80 B: yes i do that's my my [laughter] my normal search engine that i use 

514.10 518.99 A: (( same here same here so type it in there put employee leasing in quotation marks )) 

518.50 519.32 B: uh-huh 

519.36 525.63 A: and you'll be surprised uh i haven't tried it myself in fact i was going to try while we were talking here real quick employee 

526.33 530.75 A: e. m. p. l. o. y. e. e. leasing l. e. a. s. i. n. g. 

531.03 536.23 A: see if anything comes up yeah there is a lot that comes up uh twenty one thousand three hundred hits 

536.30 537.29 B: really 

537.28 544.37 A: yeah there's a professional employee organization for you know employee leasing company that specialize in workers' compensation 

544.55 546.08 A: for the construction industry 

547.08 550.04 A: and professional employee leasing inc there we go 

547.09 547.82 B: (( uh huh )) 

550.97 552.42 A: so you'd be able to 

551.06 554.03 B: oh yeah i'm on the same site i just looked it up 

553.54 554.48 A: okay 

554.50 564.63 A: so you'd be able to sp- uh provide employees that specialize just in pharmaceutical sales and i think there could be a market for that because i understand that they pay well but they also require a certain amount of training 

564.38 569.55 B: yeah oh they do that's why this next couple of years i'm just gonna make it general sales experience 

569.79 576.57 B: i mean it's gonna hard for me because i i mean with my biology background i don't have any marketing courses or business courses so it's kind of 

569.96 570.96 A: wow 

576.91 580.56 B: going to be a hard couple of years but once i get in i think i'll love it 

581.24 594.31 A: excellent excellent but uh like i said for me uh i i think i would really like to try the hypnotherapy just and again i don't think it'd be a long uh a a large cost to do it i think it'd be a lot of good 

582.34 583.10 B: yeah 

593.72 597.24 B: i think that would be so exciting to do actually i think that would be really interesting 

597.47 599.95 A: with your biology background now again
