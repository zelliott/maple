12.22 15.25 A: um a service type business from home 

15.38 28.94 A: and um i've looked into you know some things ebay and they seemed a little complicated [laughter] um i'm basically looking for something where i don't need a whole lot of start up capital what about you 

28.91 38.61 B: well um i if i were to start up a business i'd probably do something you know like a personal shopper um type business or something like that because i really 

38.41 51.31 B: i think i'm really really good with like you know refunding and you know using coupons and saving money and you know bargain hunting and so if i can like incorporate that somehow into some type of business 

50.71 51.74 A: (( mhm )) 

51.69 56.97 B: you know i would definitely do that and i would you know use referrals and you know 

57.20 61.28 B: use my friends and you know hopefully network it that way 

61.06 69.35 A: right i did try to do something like that uh a home business using these coupon booklets have you heard about that 

69.02 69.88 B: (( uh-uh mhm )) 

69.89 83.49 A: uh they're coupon booklets that you sell for um to either companies or schools or situations like that and what they do is they buy the books and they use them as incentives 

83.28 93.28 A: they um boy scouts or schools or whatever they would sell them as a fundraiser or stores or businesses can use them as incentives you know 

93.07 103.78 A: um if you buy thus and so you'll get two hundred dollars worth of of um groceries or if you try something out or test drive or something 

103.77 104.65 B: okay 

103.81 104.76 A: so 

104.76 109.67 B: yeah i've heard of that about that before like gold sea and that kind of stuff entertainment books

111.01 111.89 A: yeah 

112.07 122.97 A: well not [laughter] i'm one of those people that i need a partner i'm not i have a lot of good ideas but i'm not real good at at implementation 

122.89 123.88 B: yeah 

122.95 129.14 A: i need a partner i need someone to help me do the business 

128.75 137.34 B: yeah yeah i think it's hard though also you know when you're starting up something i mean i know you know it for me it's just like taking that big step you know 

136.30 137.98 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

137.38 141.53 B: and actually doing it i i find that to be a little difficult sometimes 

141.05 145.72 A: and i think a lot of people fall into that category where they have a fear 

145.53 159.66 A: i don't know whether it's a feel a f- a fear of failure or a fear of success in going into your own business but there's a lot of fear 'cause you're stepping out in something that you know you're not used to doing [noise] 

153.00 154.05 B: yeah 

158.98 160.24 B: yeah 

159.80 170.01 A: yeah i mean it's it's different if you're working [mn] um on a job or something or other and you know you know as long as i do this work you know i'll [noise] get that paycheck at the end of the week 

169.83 178.54 A: but when you start your own business you're you're really hanging yourself out there to dry and it's [laughter] it's a little scary 

177.96 192.49 B: [noise] very scary i'm sure so i haven't done it yet so but you know it would be nice if i if i could actually do it you know or it could get think some idea to incorporate all that into starting some type of business you know

287.01 288.16 B: (( oh really )) 

291.16 304.03 A: taking my exams to be an insurance agent for health and life so that'll be like a home based business that's something that i didn't really have to spend a lot of start up money it was more blood and sweat 

294.30 295.05 B: oh 

303.83 314.42 A: you know just studying the materials and taking the exam and thank god i passed so that [laughter] so that will be something that i'd be able to do from home you know

333.60 334.59 A: yeah 

334.55 339.17 B: i'm kind of not seeking full time employment um 

339.18 349.40 B: [lipsmack] you know right now until after the wedding but you know i i think a home based business if i could eventually do something like that would really work for me you know i think it would be nice to set your own hours 

347.16 354.90 A: well i know home based businesses that maybe you need to stay away from of all of those m._l._m.s that they have 

354.80 356.47 B: mhm which ones are those 

355.28 368.30 A: market it on the internet don't i got trapped in a couple of those just don't go there [laughter] you don't know me [sigh] but trust me they are they are rip offs okay 

357.35 358.13 B: (( oh yeah )) 

364.72 365.30 B: (( [mn] )) 

367.57 368.43 B: (( oh really )) 

368.22 374.52 A: that's not the kind of home based business and you'll end up putting in so much money 

374.37 376.25 B: oh really hm 

375.28 378.43 A: yes into into those 

376.80 378.48 B: i haven't i haven't tr- 

378.60 380.70 A: type of internet things 

380.54 382.43 B: i haven't tried any uh 

382.72 385.44 B: any ones off the internet yet or anything so 

384.63 385.67 A: mhm 

386.17 391.66 B: so not yet but i was kind of i've looked at a few but i think i've seen that one where um 

389.26 390.42 A: [laughter] 

392.61 394.71 B: [noise] uh what was it uh 

395.13 399.34 B: i think i saw something about processing fedex or u._p._s. or something 

398.93 399.97 A: mhm 

399.82 401.81 B: about that one but 

401.84 403.98 B: it seems pretty cool to me [laughter] 

403.63 408.43 A: yeah that's the ones that's the one i'm more or less um went towards 

408.29 409.67 B: okay and you 

408.70 416.53 A: i i got that information but it it's it's a bit involved and you know they make 

414.11 414.91 B: uh-huh 

416.52 424.93 A: the home based business things that they tell you about they they sound really good on paper until you get 'em into your home until you've paid the money and get it 

424.69 425.42 B: (( oh )) 

424.85 435.71 A: and it's a lot more work to it it's mostly marketing and that's the tough part you've just said it yourself these are hard economic times you know with the war and everything 

429.50 430.58 B: mhm 

435.70 436.80 B: yeah sure 

436.52 438.11 A: so [sigh] 

438.03 445.40 A: my husband and i we well like i said we're we're juggling several ideas and that er happens to be one of them 

445.20 459.48 A: but the what i was talking about are these um m._l._m.s where you have to buy something on a regular basis and encourage other people to buy as well in order to stay in the loop 

445.50 446.28 B: oh 

459.48 460.73 B: yeah 

460.23 463.54 A: i did that with a couple of health products 

463.56 464.54 A: so 

464.87 465.93 B: oh 

465.41 466.98 A: yes even 

466.08 467.50 B: didn't quite work 

467.10 481.20 A: it well the the products were excellent but it's just convincing other people to who are looking for a home based business that would be willing to do that same thing you know it's just not that easy 

481.29 487.03 B: yeah it's hard [noise] it's hard to convince other people like if you need to recruit them and you know kind of like 

485.69 489.67 A: i hate that [laughter] [laughter] 

487.06 488.25 B: yeah i know 

488.93 499.33 B: [mn] i'm sure it would be very hard so kind of just like sell like you know tupperware and you know all those type of things you know you get more money if you get people under you and you know [mn] mary kaye 

497.15 500.14 A: mary kaye [laughter] 

499.71 501.58 B: all that kind of stuff so 

500.60 510.73 A: i know i've looked into all of them [sigh] and um i i just don't wanna be in any kind of home based business where i have to recruit 

503.22 504.16 B: (( yeah )) 

510.72 515.61 A: my my relatives and friends to join in with me 

515.38 524.13 B: yeah i i agree with that i don't i just would rather stay home and do my job than have to go out and recruit people like that 

516.55 517.64 A: you know 

523.60 537.19 A: now i did used to do a lot of customer service so i am service oriented i like talking on the phone i like helping people do something and that's why i was thinking of um the u._p._s. thing 

531.05 531.95 B: uh-huh 

537.31 549.36 A: you know if i could if i could help people to recoup dollars or something like that or i even got the one where it's a telephone don't get that by the way the telephone recovery 

537.42 538.40 B: oh yeah 

547.82 548.56 B: oh 

549.22 553.88 A: you it [laughter] it's almost as though you have to be a telephone engineer 

553.91 556.58 A: to understand all of this stuff 

554.04 555.15 B: really 

556.30 557.72 B: oh my goodness 

557.13 566.10 A: oh it's horrible it was uh it's got two thick manuals like two inches thick two different tapes it was like going to class 

565.85 567.01 B: (( jeez )) 

566.51 576.63 A: [laughter] i said do you know what i wanna be service oriented in my home based business but that's a little much i said 

575.79 576.65 B: yeah 

576.45 589.14 A: i you have to learn all of this stuff they've got all these symbols because when you go through the telephone bill you have to be able to pick out what it is they're paying for and what they're being overcharged for 

589.43 594.62 B: yeah that would be really hard because i don't i it's hard to decide for your own phone bill 

590.31 591.45 A: [laughter] 

593.65 599.99 A: (( [laughter] i know [laughter] well they exactly they've got the the two manuals and two ))
