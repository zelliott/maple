104.80 106.06 B: mhm 

105.48 106.71 A: um 

107.14 116.31 A: there's a lot of work involved in it and that as well as any kind of business uh particularly number one first of all you have to 

116.59 128.91 A: [mn] make sure that it's a type of business that is in demand that people need and uh and that the market of your targeted audience the consumers that you're 

122.56 123.86 B: mhm 

128.80 133.42 A: reaching out towards will support that specific type of business 

133.57 138.69 A: uh in my case it's just about anybody 'cause everybody needs a home

138.84 141.83 A: yeah and uh number two 

142.07 144.55 A: um you know 

147.00 150.64 A: quote unquote fictitious name a good name for the company 

150.70 157.40 A: and then uh you're gonna have to be um the company has to be registered in the state you live or you or you live to 

158.92 171.13 A: uh which involves filing corporation papers either as a self proprietor or partnership like l. l. c. or a incorp- or a corporation 

170.49 171.47 B: mhm 

171.14 183.40 A: and that involves a few dollars [sigh] uh once you do that and you have the name and location and the uh principals of the company filed 

184.10 187.41 A: then you know it's just a matter of uh 

187.77 193.55 A: um reaching out to the targeted audience and as in my case uh it's just locating 

193.61 207.31 A: um [lipsmack] vacant lots or buildings uh that are just sitting around and need need to be uh renovated and re- rehabilitated for uh to be lived in 

203.94 205.18 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

207.79 210.97 A: and uh and that involves um 

211.61 218.12 A: going and finding out who the owners are in my case uh the existing lot or building 

218.15 227.65 A: um purchasing it from them and getting a loan from the bank to do the uh renovations 

227.70 235.15 A: and hiring the right types of people that have the experience to do that type of work such as a general contractor with the right crew 

235.30 239.20 A: uh hire an architect if you're going to make structural changes 

239.34 244.94 A: things of that sort and then uh once you do if you're going to rent or sell the units 

244.99 249.82 A: um [lipsmack] hire a real estate broker to do that part for you 

250.23 258.54 A: and then you've gotta have a bank account a corporate bank account so that you can do business with the general public as well as other business 

258.76 259.57 A: (( um )) 

259.81 266.35 A: you know just uh and then you know you have to have a tax i. d. that's another thing too you have to be registered with the i. r. s. 

266.36 269.37 A: so you can pay your taxes in a timely fashion 

269.73 274.24 A: and also network with other businesses um [lipsmack] 

274.34 289.27 A: you know have a synergistic relationship with yours such as um [lipsmack] businesses that deal with uh um real estate that offers uh let well brokers real estate brokers for one 

289.21 290.55 A: and two 

290.84 292.60 A: um 

292.86 297.70 A: [lipsmack] uh let's see off the top of my head um banks 

297.82 309.56 A: uh who provide commercial loans uh their their business partners um city agencies like the the department of city planning uh 

309.71 316.46 A: they they're good too things like that um entities like those um 

316.58 320.18 A: you know uh that's that's essentially 

320.21 329.10 A: what you would need to really be successful and good advertising too that um word of mouth being the best form huh 

329.25 330.34 A: so 

330.60 335.58 A: um that's just so far from my experience that's pretty much been the um 

335.93 342.75 A: the uh case with me and also you know in your day to day travels you also meet with people that are looking to buy 

342.83 355.54 A: and they become good prospects in buying uh units of a building that you may own or are looking to own that you're going to sell so you can build a nice rolodex file of all these potential buyers 

355.68 367.55 A: you know things like that yeah [lipsmack] and if you're buying commercial buildings there is always people that are looking for spaces to rent or to purchase [noise] whether they be a restaurant 

356.66 357.63 B: mhm 

369.15 370.83 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

374.10 379.85 A: owner you know whatever type of business a person's getting into they need commercial space so 

380.03 394.60 A: uh you become a good prospect for them so you know you as you travel around constantly you're always look- keeping your eyes and ears open for people that are looking for spaces to operate their business or looking to buy 

392.53 393.51 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

394.54 398.53 A: for a residential unit or uh residential space to let 

399.04 400.09 A: so 

400.28 408.16 A: yeah you know that's that's that's part of the success of a business and just running it properly and you know following 

408.98 412.64 A: federal regulations and all that good stuff 

413.94 418.46 B: yep yep do you ever like go um buy like properties from auctions or 

417.08 420.31 A: (( yeah um )) 

420.64 429.09 A: i haven't yet but i know some developers who do uh properties that are foreclosed on by banks 

421.73 422.50 B: uh-huh 

428.40 429.31 B: mhm 

430.39 444.64 A: uh that take them over some have these big auctions like and uh you just go there and you could buy them for a thousand for pennies in a dollar rather um and or um 

445.04 449.30 A: you can just pay whatever balance that's outstanding 

449.43 462.82 A: 'cause the banks don't wanna o- they don't wanna own properties they just want their money so you just take it off their hands for the balance that's outstanding and you can just re- rehabilitate the property uh provided you have the capital 

452.23 453.16 B: mhm 

462.21 462.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

464.23 465.33 B: oh cool
