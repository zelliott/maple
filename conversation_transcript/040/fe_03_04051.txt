4.93 6.33 B: lisa 

5.70 8.27 A: lisa hi this is molity 

8.18 9.84 B: (( [noise] hi how are you )) 

9.46 14.12 A: i'm fine do you do you have a sense of the topic of the day 

13.99 17.19 B: yes this is my first time i've called ah so 

16.09 19.51 A: well me too me too lisa so um 

17.40 18.54 B: (( oh okay )) 

18.87 19.67 B: okay 

19.89 23.22 A: the so if we if money were no object what 

23.44 26.95 A: what type of business and how would we go about it is that ah 

26.54 28.29 B: yeah that was the topic 

28.65 29.62 A: okay 

28.84 31.82 B: [noise] um i would probably open a craft store 

31.90 33.42 A: a craft store 

33.17 34.71 B: (( yeah )) 

33.81 34.96 A: oh cool 

35.14 40.56 B: yeah i i i'm i like to make crafts but i'm not really good at it and so i 

37.78 38.50 A: uh-huh 

39.34 40.23 A: uh-huh 

40.70 46.01 B: i probably would like to um mingle with other people craft stores are always kind of busy 

45.67 49.17 A: right it provi- provides um materials for it 

48.40 55.03 B: yeah yeah i think that would be kind of you'd have classes like ceramic classes and things like that i think that would be kind of fun 

49.39 50.37 A: yeah 

55.17 56.79 A: that that would be fun 

57.20 59.93 A: and i i think if 

60.04 71.89 A: money were no object and i've actually started a couple of businesses and money was an object [laughter] so if money were no object then i think 

67.49 70.15 B: [laughter] 

71.95 73.80 A: i would um 

73.97 80.17 A: actually go into the business of speaking at conferences like being a public speaker 

80.16 81.13 B: oh 

80.66 84.23 A: and i i've done that and it's um 

84.44 96.22 A: it's it's a lot of fun and it's ah it's real rewarding because you've got an audience of you know four or five hundred people in front of you and it's um 

97.92 100.16 A: it's quick pay 

100.17 111.34 A: rather than the sort of sixteen hour day stuff that [cough] you do to like piece together income and and being a conference speaker you pop in and you pop out 

111.40 117.55 A: and then and they pay you whatever from five hundred to a thousand dollars so it's kind of it's kind of nice 

117.81 118.84 B: wow 

118.54 120.12 A: yeah now 

119.47 125.71 B: you would have to have a wide range of topics or do you spec- or do you specify one topic you talk about 

124.41 131.13 A: well i i'm a specialist in this in a field called diversity which is intercultural communication 

131.23 134.96 A: and i've i've put together a 

135.11 148.09 A: topic called diversity for dessert and i try to i have in the past i haven't done this for a couple of years um mostly because of the economy but hm um i try to pitch it to 

148.08 151.11 A: professional associations because they have 

151.34 155.09 A: yearly conferences annual conferences like i bet 

155.37 156.81 A: the craft 

157.33 167.20 A: business has their annual craft show or twice a year craft show or the new products come out you know the vendors are showing all the new products 

167.45 175.86 A: and um they also might have talks about how to work with people from other cultures who are going to come into your store 

176.49 183.24 A: stuff like that and it's almost every single industry has some need these days to 

177.50 178.38 B: uh-huh 

184.06 189.73 A: ah learn about how to work with other cultures because we live in a multicultural society 

189.47 195.80 B: [noise] right um i work for a large company and they have a whole department of just diversity 

192.38 193.16 A: uh-huh 

195.37 198.18 A: yeah that's right that's exactly right 

197.24 198.74 B: you know the whole department 

198.94 199.96 A: yeah 

200.12 200.76 B: w- 

200.32 205.76 A: so l- i'm interested in this craft store do you have an idea how you would go about it 

206.18 214.97 B: ah no i probably would look for someone maybe selling their business and maybe just try to get those supplies and things and um 

210.94 211.77 A: uh-huh 

213.94 214.79 A: uh-huh 

215.14 219.95 B: [lipsmack] i just think that um there's a place here in indianapolis i live in indianapolis 

219.42 220.25 A: uh-huh 

220.39 231.44 B: and there's a place here where you can go in and they've got the oh they do like the green pottery pieces and you can paint your own and then they fire 'em up and you like they have birthday parties there for kids 

226.86 228.39 A: oh yeah 

231.01 232.19 A: oh cool 

232.01 237.63 B: and um i think if you expanded that more into not just ceramics but other types of 

237.90 239.82 B: craft items 

239.46 240.51 A: right 

240.35 246.70 B: and but they have birthday parties there and get together for women and things i just that would be kind of fun 

246.35 249.46 A: that would be fun it would establish a 

249.54 254.66 A: a group of like a lot of colleagues that are are surrounded by the same interest 

254.34 257.82 B: right i'm not sure how profitable it would be though 

257.73 267.92 A: well there was a place here i'm in palo alto california near stanford and there there is place here i can't remember what it's called but they had greenware 

262.32 263.09 B: uh-huh 

267.79 273.45 A: and they invited people to come in and like paint their own their own glazes and stuff 

273.50 286.48 A: and then they would fire it for you and they were immensely popular and i think they did go out of business but partly that's because the rental prices here are just ah astronomical 

286.21 287.22 B: oh 

286.55 292.40 A: so right now commercial property's really really low so right now is the time if you're open a site based business 

292.47 298.66 A: that it would work because ah they're you know our our our economy sucks out here 

298.06 299.40 B: yeah [laughter] 

298.93 300.46 A: and um 

300.83 307.90 A: so now would be the time to put something together like that plus people want and are looking for small [cough] 

308.01 309.94 A: investments for fun 

310.02 314.52 A: you know the big investments for fun like going to the big amusement parks and stuff 

314.67 317.22 A: they're too expensive for people right now 

317.16 318.41 B: right 

317.30 327.41 A: that that would go to a ah a a craft store and and do a little something and then have you know like for mom's day or something you know 

326.79 328.09 B: right 

327.57 334.75 A: [noise] and and ah or a group of women getting together that would be very cool i'd like that myself as a customer 

335.54 339.74 A: you know so and i think now's probably the right economy for it 

339.83 346.14 B: right i i'm not sure if i'd make a very good business owner 'cause i'm not very disciplined i probably wouldn't go into work one day 

346.37 348.20 A: yeah well then you get a partner 

346.57 347.69 B: i'd just suck 

348.16 355.49 B: yeah [laughter] yeah i'm not a very disciplined person i don't know if i could be self employed 

348.21 351.50 A: (( [laughter] you know )) 

355.63 367.11 A: yeah oh well i have been and it requires you to be at work at eight thirty in the morning or whatever just like just like anything else i would take my kids to school and then i would come home and start work 

367.14 371.73 A: so it's supposed you know and stay work at five thirty and the kids come home from school 

371.79 374.72 A: and i'd say pretend that mom is five miles away 

374.84 376.73 B: [noise] oh that's a good idea 

375.02 379.35 A: so that they you know they wouldn't be jumping at me every five minutes while i'm still trying to 

378.42 382.43 B: right i wondered how people that work at home with their children 

382.49 383.83 B: do it but 

383.53 388.99 A: yeah when they're really really little you really can't do it because you know they don't they don't know you're there 

388.66 389.89 B: (( yeah )) 

389.07 391.02 A: and you can't shut the door on them 

390.72 392.03 B: right [laughter] 

391.48 402.42 A: you know but when they go to get to be school age then you can and it it gives you the flexibility of being able to go to after school events 

402.68 405.64 A: and ah you know slot them around to 

405.82 408.40 A: [cough] 'scuse me all the things they have to do after school 

408.57 418.55 A: so that's the upside of having your own business and then again if you have a partner or a trusted employee to watch the store while you're gone 

416.96 418.21 B: [noise] 

418.63 421.47 B: yeah that's what i would need because ah 

421.56 426.33 B: i tend to call in sick a lot or take a lot of vacation days at work so 

425.04 425.81 A: (( do you )) 

426.21 429.57 A: that sounds like you don't enjoy the work ah [noise] 

426.51 427.28 B: i 

428.69 429.45 B: (( ah )) 

429.46 432.77 B: i just enjoy everything [laughter] i enjoy free time 

432.80 433.87 A: yeah 

433.40 436.67 B: vacations i'm a vacation person so 

436.03 436.81 A: yeah 

436.94 444.99 A: you know what they say about entrepreneurs though [cough] that an entrepreneur is a person who would spend sixteen hours a day doing what they would not 

445.02 447.55 A: do eight hours a day working for somebody else 

446.89 456.19 B: [laughter] that could be there also a difference when you have to do something and wanting to do it i think there's a big difference there sometimes too 

452.50 454.57 A: y- exactly exactly 

456.27 458.65 A: yeah oh is that our tone are we done 

459.05 459.94 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

459.64 461.18 A: is that our ten minute tone 

461.91 463.68 A: that went that went fast 

462.02 466.40 B: um i guess so because i'm on my cell phone and it's says um 

466.53 468.79 B: i'm at twelve forty now 

468.79 469.59 A: (( oh )) 

469.47 472.29 B: and i think it was a little after two when you came on 

472.04 475.09 A: did you did you hear the tone or is it just somebody 

474.22 475.86 B: no i didn't hear any tone 

475.21 478.76 A: okay it may have been somebody trying to ring through here on the call waiting 

477.69 478.55 B: oh 

479.10 479.91 B: okay 

479.27 483.46 A: so [cough] um i think that they'll be more obvious than that 

482.66 483.73 B: (( oh okay )) 

483.61 484.54 A: um 

485.71 490.42 A: and with my business the hardest part would be the 

488.52 489.22 B: (( [noise] )) 

490.75 495.06 A: start up phase putting in tons and tons of hours getting together 

495.19 496.14 A: (( the )) 

496.25 506.26 A: ah the collateral for sending out you know marketing packets like i already have a demo video but of course i was a lot younger then and i don't think i even look like that now 

496.29 496.85 B: (( [noise] )) 

506.13 508.79 B: [laughter] 

506.49 507.99 A: (( and ah )) 

508.58 510.79 A: you know then sending that out 

510.99 513.60 A: and now what was that you heard that tone 

511.24 511.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

513.74 514.44 B: (( no )) 

514.32 518.46 A: (( [laughter] i'm hearing all kinds of stuff on my end )) 

518.55 519.68 A: um 

520.12 523.34 A: and then and then c- just contacting conference 

523.67 532.05 A: planner after conference planner after conference planner and and making sure that um you get known and it's just what 

525.54 526.29 B: [noise] 

530.92 532.10 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah my )) 

532.30 535.47 B: father does um consul- consulting work 

535.05 535.99 A: uh-huh 

535.83 538.80 B: and um he goes round the conferences 

538.72 539.71 A: yeah 

539.02 543.30 B: he he does um emergency planning 

543.91 547.98 B: um teaching communities and businesses to plan for disasters 

547.44 549.06 A: oh really yeah 

548.44 549.47 B: yeah 

549.60 552.83 A: so does he get paid when he gets goes to conferences or is he 

552.18 563.34 B: yeah yeah he gets um he goes to different fire departments and then to different businesses and [noise] then conferences and there's a lot of fire department conferences that's a big conference area 

555.82 556.66 A: yeah 

561.25 561.92 A: y- 

562.70 563.99 A: y- yeah 

564.02 564.88 A: yeah 

564.03 567.94 B: fire service emergency rescue services 

567.82 568.85 A: right 

569.20 576.49 A: now are they conference are they like continuing education conferences or are they conferences for 

576.62 577.91 A: um 

577.91 590.67 B: i think like the magazines there's a fire rescue magazine they have a conference and it's more of trying to get a bunch of suppliers of fire emergency apparatus together to sell and then they have conferences over to the side to get people 

584.68 585.62 A: (( oh right )) 

590.27 592.09 A: right right
