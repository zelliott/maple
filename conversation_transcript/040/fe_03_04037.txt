0.00 3.40 B: [mn] hi my name's tim i'm in los angeles 

4.79 7.35 A: ah i'm marie i'm in san diego 

7.48 14.97 B: oh hi it's a compelling topic don't you think one million dollars to leave the united states [noise] 

11.15 11.98 A: huh 

12.83 13.61 A: wo- 

14.30 15.54 A: would you do it 

16.13 25.68 B: i i think i would i don't know though i i never thought about it in those terms before i mean there are places you could go that are just about as good like canada or something like that [mn] 

26.66 33.02 A: [mn] yeah that's true i don't know ah at first i was thinking probably i wouldn't 

32.88 33.81 B: really 

33.17 36.04 A: i wouldn't leave for a million dollars just because 

36.32 37.19 A: like 

37.08 38.03 B: mhm 

37.30 51.84 A: the state of the united states right now it's um i don't know it's it's like you have freedom you have freedom of speech and like you have everything else i mean there's the good and the bad but like you know what i'm saying like it's like a good balance you can't really get it in other countries 

45.88 46.84 B: mhm 

50.66 56.75 B: yeah yeah well we've definitely been able to live here so far so obviously it works for us in some way 

56.68 62.41 A: yeah because i mean i'm um i grew in the philippines like for five years and like 

62.08 63.56 B: oh yeah 

62.94 65.18 A: in i don't know i mean 

65.93 72.67 A: i would still want to retain my u._s. citizenship just because there's so many benefits you know like medicare and like 

69.74 70.71 B: mhm 

72.69 81.95 A: all those other things you don't like you don't get that like in other countries at all like [noise] if you get like a disease it's like they take care of it with their own means you know 

77.77 78.83 B: mhm 

82.02 91.56 B: [mn] right well certainly in some countries but i mean i actually find that kind of ironic because you know how the philippines came to become a u._s. possession in the first place 

91.29 94.77 A: (( [noise] yeah because yeah the whole yeah i know what you mean )) 

91.58 92.48 B: don't you 

94.39 95.54 B: well i mean 

94.73 106.90 A: yeah well it's k- it i i i was looking into that like you know the history of like because like you know all the countries got colonized like third world countries were colonized by the united states but it's like irre- irreversible you know like 

101.32 102.36 B: yeah 

106.74 107.54 B: yeah 

106.90 111.61 A: [cough] like most people over there are like are more like pro american like they want to be american 

111.49 117.00 B: yeah well i guess they are now [laughter] but i understand they had to kill hundreds of thousands of people to make it that way [mn] 

116.40 119.73 A: yeah ah yeah i mean i totally see that but it's 

119.82 120.63 B: yeah 

119.99 124.24 A: i don't know it's i don't know that's kinda contradictory i mean what do you think like 

123.29 135.13 B: yeah well for me that's just kind of the contradictory nature of america i mean on the one hand we have all this wonderful freedom but [mn] like if you get in the way of the authorities you could get shot down just like any of the filipino rebels did [mn] 

135.11 145.89 B: so i don't know i mean i feel it's like okay if you play within the system you have like a pretty good chance but i mean even totally innocent people can get messed up i don't know 

135.47 137.42 A: yeah that's true 

141.61 143.01 A: i mean i think 

145.98 157.01 A: yeah but aren't like i mean i guess if you go to a third world country that wouldn't be like a good idea but if you were to go to like europe and you had a million dollars like that would be a totally different story you know what i'm saying 

152.16 153.16 B: yeah 

154.05 155.18 B: yeah 

156.13 165.62 B: yeah well i mean there are totally cultured countries you could go to i mean plenty of english speaking countries too canada united kingdom you know australia 

164.46 177.97 A: yeah that'd be actually that wouldn't it you know that wouldn't be a good idea and it would be a good idea you know because other people can get settled in like south american countries or other countries that like have their own type of wealth and you know 

169.76 171.55 B: (( hm )) 

173.56 174.48 B: yeah 

177.06 178.62 B: yeah 

177.80 188.33 A: freedom i guess so i guess it's not it's good and bad they probably asked the question just because like um of the whole terrorist thing [laughter] that's what i i was thinking 

179.31 180.15 B: yeah 

181.70 182.53 B: yeah 

186.35 195.01 B: yeah they certainly seem to be asking political questions like that i hope we don't go on like lists for like [laughter] you know who believes what you know 

190.30 191.53 A: yeah we 

193.20 200.44 A: i know oh i'm pretty sure they probably like listen in to calls and stuff but that's not really one of my worries like 

198.10 199.17 B: yeah 

199.75 207.30 B: yeah well i think that's good though i mean i think everybody should talk about these things openly and like listen to what other people have to say 'cause 

206.64 210.88 A: yeah but like in san diego like if if they were to bring it up like 

208.97 209.82 B: yeah 

211.13 215.01 A: like a lot of people in like southern california are so like 

215.26 219.74 A: like pro american to the point where [mn] like it's unquestionable 

217.65 218.52 B: mhm 

219.88 222.11 A: you know like i saw this 

219.92 223.80 B: yeah well that's the natural state of things i guess 

223.58 226.82 A: yeah well 'cause i'm from northern california and i guess it 

225.86 227.01 B: oh really 

226.80 228.83 A: yeah and it has a more open 

228.73 242.98 A: like understanding of like culture and religion and like am- because like to them like being american citizen means like having the freedom to actually question like what's going on in the government as well like that's the way they're trying to fix it you know 'cause like 

229.28 230.31 B: yeah 

237.99 239.07 B: yeah 

242.46 243.73 B: right 

243.08 248.33 A: it's always been in history you know like the people like rebel and always something you know like [mn] 

246.44 247.42 B: yeah 

248.45 250.73 A: like civil rights and all that you know 

248.66 249.66 B: yeah 

250.71 251.77 B: yeah 

250.88 257.47 A: but people down here are so like you know it's like the what do they call it the finest city in america 

252.94 254.00 B: right 

257.16 259.39 B: oh really [laughter] is that what they call it 

258.19 260.73 A: yeah they call san diego that 

259.97 271.02 B: cool wow well as somebody from between those two places i [laughter] i have to say i think it it is important to question what's going on and [mn] i mean you have to be 

270.79 276.22 B: faithful to your country first and that doesn't always mean being faithful to whatever government happens to be in charge 

276.28 277.77 A: that's true 

277.19 290.39 B: i mean think of it like almost anyone can get elected under the circumstances these days so i mean do you really want to leave that power like up for grabs [mn] i mean we have bush now but who could come next 

277.86 279.59 A: (( it's kinda scary )) 

282.94 284.18 A: wow 

286.72 287.73 A: (( i was just )) 

289.75 291.17 A: that's true 

291.17 292.67 B: (( yeah )) 

291.51 298.26 A: i don't know i think like they all set it up though the whole bush thing 'cause [mn] i don't know there has to be something else 

295.42 297.28 B: yeah i think 

297.61 301.26 B: yeah well you're not the only person who thinks that [laughter] 

300.45 314.10 A: i know i mean like it's i don't know in some way like i don't read much into the news but if you look like through the lines and it's kinda like weird how the like the like the events like roll through you know like first and 

302.41 303.86 B: (( mm )) 

307.30 308.33 B: mhm 

313.31 314.32 B: yeah 

314.27 315.54 B: (( oh i know )) 

314.43 315.59 A: i don't know 

315.48 325.45 B: well i mean [mn] the supreme court decided the election for one thing i mean when they handed down that ruling that those votes had to be counted that in effect decided who was going to be president [mn] 

325.39 338.57 B: and i don't know if to me that's kind of scary that like a panel of like these justices you know can decide who the president is gonna be and then the president can turn around and launch a war against any country in the world without having to answer to anyone 

330.31 331.99 A: can like decide 

332.67 334.33 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

338.41 342.60 B: i mean to me it's like how long can it be before that power gets abused mm 

343.24 344.96 A: (( i know you know i mean it's )) 

345.01 349.09 A: [mn] i i guess it's kinda like you can't really control that you know 

349.28 352.09 B: yeah that's what i'm i guess that's what worries me 

349.64 350.44 A: (( like )) 

350.54 354.77 A: he's outta control it's like what you can just do yourself you know 

354.04 363.01 B: yeah well a million a million dollars to leave america though i mean looked at in in those terms like could you do it or would you even want to do it 

354.96 356.44 A: that's really scary 

361.10 362.81 A: but a million dollars 

363.03 368.52 A: like a million dollars it's like i- if you want to go to a rich country that wouldn't be that much money 

368.01 371.82 B: yeah no it's true you can hardly buy a house in los angeles [laughter] for a million dollars 

371.08 380.29 A: yeah you know but like if you were to go like i mean if you were trying to like a vagabond life then that's pretty like you know it's pretty good like 

372.39 374.35 B: yeah it's true 

377.16 378.15 B: yeah 

379.01 384.89 B: yeah but who wants to live like a vagabond for the rest of their lives and be banished from their native country you know [noise] 

384.72 390.84 A: well unless you can go to philippines and you know like use that to buy a plot of land and [laughter] [noise] build your own house 

388.05 394.28 B: yeah yeah i guess philippines wouldn't be considered united states would it it's a it's an independent country 

392.53 393.53 A: no 

393.67 397.66 A: no it's not it's um they um they separated in like the nineteen 

397.77 401.74 A: nineteen hundreds and they gained independence or was it nineteen ten but it's 

399.81 403.29 B: oh is it still like a protectorate or something 

403.39 404.79 A: no like 

404.71 407.91 A: um i don't think it is because um you know how they had that 

407.78 421.65 A: the um the military base there they they wanted all the american the american bases out like i i think it was like nineteen i don't know it was before though i i know that they're gone now but we were thinking of getting like maybe getting filipino like um 

407.87 408.70 B: yeah 

411.35 412.26 B: yeah 

412.99 413.87 B: (( right yeah )) 

418.06 419.08 B: right 

421.60 425.50 A: filipino american alliances going just because of the whole like terrorist thing 

424.04 425.00 B: yeah 

425.19 433.18 B: [mn] that's true i understand the philippines has a big problem with terrorists and som- tourism themselves don't they do you hear about that much 

430.92 432.61 A: yeah 'cause there are um 

433.14 441.83 A: yeah because there's a lot of muslims that live in the south like the whole al qaeda network's probably like linked to that indonesia is like right to the left of that 

436.38 437.27 B: right 

440.29 444.12 B: yeah i know there have been those sort of muslim separatists or whatever right 

443.37 445.46 A: yeah i mean like 

445.68 451.44 A: i don't know i ah i only believe that's like mus- muslim fen- fundamentalism because like like 

449.65 450.98 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

451.53 459.00 A: you know some of them aren't really that bad you know it's like they're being portrayed like really negatively about it but i don't know 

456.48 457.50 B: mhm 

457.72 461.11 B: [mn] yeah i guess there's two sides to every story [noise] but 

461.66 463.00 B: (( [mn] [noise] i don't know )) 

461.83 465.98 A: i i don't know like a million dollars wouldn't be a lot like 

465.41 471.67 B: [noise] no i agree i don't know it would a l- enough like 'cause [mn] i don't know 

470.40 478.87 A: could trade that in for like i guess if you you're not asking for like comfort you know comfort that's basically what america's about like comfort 

472.44 473.94 B: yeah 

475.82 476.92 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

478.81 486.45 B: yeah and i don't know about never being able to return i mean there are a lot of people that i know and i'm sure you do too who like you would never be able to see again 

484.55 485.71 A: (( yeah i )) 

486.72 490.82 A: mean and probably like if you want to go the extreme of things you know like 

486.78 488.67 B: and that would be a real bummer 

490.93 492.19 B: yeah 

491.12 498.18 A: you know what i'm saying like i don't know that's yeah i woul- i- i i don't think i would if i- [mn] it means i wouldn't be able to return 

493.57 494.61 B: yeah 

495.93 497.02 B: yeah 

497.95 502.04 B: [mn] do you think there's a price at which you would accept the offer 

502.56 507.70 B: i mean like a hundred billion dollars or something like that 

507.32 509.60 A: i don't a hundred billion 

509.12 522.44 B: yeah well like i mean think like for a hundred billion you could like create your own country off the shore of california or something [laughter] you know so i guess there is a price where it becomes and you could like invite everyone you know like to come and stay for free [mn] 

509.73 511.96 A: that's like you could [laughter] 

513.48 516.22 A: that's what i was gonna say [laughter] 

522.37 524.06 A: yeah i mean 'cause like 

522.47 524.53 B: that would be kinda cool 

524.37 531.79 A: yeah that'd be that would be a different circumstance but one million the stakes is like that's i mean one million like in these days is really small 

526.32 527.47 B: yeah 

530.97 539.87 B: [noise] i know it's true if you want to consider a whole person's lifetime and not ever being able to work in the united states which let's face it is like the best way to make money in the first place [mn] 

532.68 533.65 A: (( you know )) 

536.94 537.94 A: yeah 

540.42 541.64 A: wow 

540.46 548.48 B: so i don't know yeah i don't know i think i'd have to turn it down on purely self interest grounds myself just 'cause the amount's too small 

547.19 551.16 A: that's yeah i don't the comfort the comfort thing is a big thing 

549.17 550.89 B: yeah 

551.22 554.63 A: 'cause like you've got to go move to another country real you know 

554.39 558.83 B: yeah it's true you've gotta s- you know change your whole life and like 

557.34 560.95 A: i think that's really like a terrorist question [laughter] 

560.58 567.79 B: yeah [laughter] i know well what would the terrorists say yes for one hundred million ah one million i would do it yes [laughter] i don't know 

567.00 569.61 A: i know that's kinda that's sad 

569.07 575.03 B: i'm sure there are some people who are like yeah i'd love to go back to [noise] like whatever country i just came from yeah 

573.33 580.08 A: yeah a- i'm pretty sure if you were like you were like raised in another country it would be a different you'd have a different perspective 

577.38 585.63 B: yeah yeah i mean then it would be a piece of cake like you know yeah return to like you know poland or wherever and bring a million dollars to help my whole family 

580.73 581.75 A: yeah 

585.49 587.27 A: (( in american dollars )) 

585.53 592.57 B: i can see for some people that would be a great idea but yeah [noise] 

588.54 590.00 A: that is true 

590.01 593.87 A: i guess it's like it depend- it varies for different people you know 

593.90 597.78 B: yeah it does it totally depends on your circumstances i guess 

597.94 599.95 B: (( so the price would be )) 

598.15 599.14 A: i don't
