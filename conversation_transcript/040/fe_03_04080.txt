8.41 17.78 A: [mn] [laughter] well i work in an r. and d. company and i would i don't know i haven't given this a lot of thought obviously since the call just arrived but 

16.88 17.75 B: right 

17.61 24.29 A: i would probably um at this point uh i'd like to open up a consulting business um 

24.27 35.02 A: perhaps uh in the area of technical management um i'm i've been at this for quite a while i'm uh sixty two years old so 

35.29 49.79 A: [sigh] you know it's the kind of thing where i i don't want to uh try to um start a new start up that's going to take twenty thirty years to to blossom um [lipsmack] but i'd like to you know i could i could enjoy something um 

43.84 44.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

45.48 46.65 B: right 

49.82 52.40 A: that i just described how 'bout yourself 

52.87 55.94 B: [lipsmack] well [mn] i don't know maybe 

56.42 57.51 B: (( um )) 

58.33 62.37 B: i guess a sewing business i do have a uh-huh 

60.79 62.27 A: sewing uh-huh 

62.59 69.04 B: i have a small sewing business in my home and maybe i guess i could make one a little bigger [laughter] 

68.44 73.08 A: i see well that's interesting so you already have have that what uh 

72.03 74.51 B: i i do like custom sewing 

74.14 75.09 A: uh-huh 

74.68 76.05 B: in my home 

75.53 77.47 A: uh-huh well that's great 

77.36 78.17 B: so 

77.50 81.92 A: what uh what sort of thing i mean do you make clothing for people or 

81.62 87.10 B: um that and do wedding gowns and dresses and just things like that 

82.19 82.80 A: (( re- )) 

84.15 85.04 A: uh-huh 

86.53 88.99 A: right right well that's 

87.96 91.05 B: so i guess i could expand on that [laughter] 

90.58 91.52 A: right 

91.61 95.19 A: well i guess one of the questions we should maybe address is um 

95.35 100.02 A: okay now you'd open up a sewing business i'd open up a technical 

100.05 104.90 A: management consulting business um how would you go about it [mn] 

106.66 108.10 B: (( [sigh] well )) 

108.67 110.40 B: i don't know 

111.01 115.05 B: i guess i would perhaps still have it in my home maybe 

115.42 130.03 B: make uh more of a showroom or something like that right now i just use my sewing room but [noise] i might make a little area where i could um have clients come and be fitted and measured and everything so 

121.37 122.23 A: uh-huh 

129.30 130.19 A: sure 

130.77 134.25 A: well that sounds good and do you would you uh envision 

134.73 139.73 A: [mn] hiring people i'm trying to remember if they said that money was no object d- did you recall 

138.57 140.71 B: yeah i think they said that [laughter] 

140.00 148.18 A: oh that sounds wonderful well you should go to fifth avenue or something in new york and uh [laughter] do this up uh in a full blown way 

145.27 146.30 B: [laughter] 

148.25 152.87 B: yeah it would probably be simple i live in a small rural area so 

152.00 152.88 A: uh-huh 

153.26 154.20 B: um 

154.51 158.78 B: it probably wouldn't be too much different maybe than what i've got now so 

158.18 167.23 A: right so one of your it sounds like one of your values is to [lipsmack] stay stay in your home and uh do you have a family 

165.20 166.34 B: right 

166.94 172.90 B: um i still have one daughter left at home a teenager and then my other my boys are married 

172.32 182.34 A: uh-huh right yeah well it's um we have two sons they're both grown and married and have children of their own now but uh 

173.53 174.60 B: so 

182.85 195.49 A: yeah i can understand a desire to stay at home or at least in your home there's also i also have a or see some value in getting outside of the house so you know having um your own 

186.48 187.43 B: mhm 

195.60 198.69 A: sort of boutique shop in the center of town 

198.52 199.57 B: yeah 

198.94 203.41 A: might um [lipsmack] might help with your with your business if you had a nice 

203.45 214.55 A: like a nice storefront where you could display the kinds of things that you do and attract attention to it w- would you consider something like that if you if you [laughter] were to go down this hypothetical path 

208.82 209.93 B: mhm 

214.02 216.58 B: [laughter] well that would be nice 

216.28 223.15 A: yeah yeah is there enough business in your town do you think to uh justify that sort of thing 

217.63 218.65 B: yeah 

220.28 221.36 B: um 

222.66 229.04 B: [lipsmack] there might be as far as like a sewing business because really there there isn't anything there's no 

229.14 242.03 B: shops that i can think of that you go you can go there unless you went to like a drycleaners which they'll sew on buttons for you [laughter] for you or something but um i guess yeah if i really thought it about it would probably be a good thing [lipsmack] 

235.26 237.57 A: [noise] yeah right right 

241.36 243.09 A: yeah sure 

243.10 249.45 A: well you know one of the things that um that we've done uh over the last few years is um 

249.44 258.39 A: we've had a really wonderful seamstress uh we have a um vacation home on cape cod that we will eventually retire to 

258.59 264.07 A: and um my wife has been decorating it so we've had this great seam- seamstress 

264.07 267.05 A: making you know drapes and um 

267.01 272.70 A: valances over the windows and things like that and uh i would imagine if you're 

268.53 269.58 B: mhm 

272.49 282.99 A: you know good at sewing and enjoy it um something like that would or could expand you know the kind of business that you could do um 

281.99 283.48 B: mhm 

283.12 285.54 A: but uh maybe that's not as uh 

285.85 295.68 A: as demanding as uh making wedding gowns i would think wedding gowns i i don't know much about it but i would think wedding gowns would be difficult i mean that'd be very challenging 

294.07 296.64 B: well that's something i like so 

295.99 296.87 A: uh-huh 

297.12 301.12 A: so you like that better than the the draperies and stuff like that 

299.58 304.61 B: yeah and i i do like curtains and things like that um 

303.04 303.92 A: uh-huh 

305.42 310.75 B: so yeah but you know as i said i'm in a rural area i live on a dirt road 

308.87 309.85 A: right 

310.19 311.33 A: oh do ya 

310.83 312.02 B: [laughter] yeah 

311.35 312.74 A: oh that's great 

312.65 314.27 B: so um 

314.48 316.27 B: yeah it wouldn't be like 

317.07 321.19 B: you know like it would be a real blooming business i guess 

320.64 322.51 A: [cough] right right 

321.34 323.37 B: but it's enough for me [laughter] 

322.75 324.29 A: yeah sure 

324.36 325.86 A: well that sounds nice 

326.18 327.18 A: um 

327.86 335.90 A: [lipsmack] w- with regard to a technical management kind of consulting business i i haven't even really thought about how i would go about that but 

336.01 344.74 A: i think what i might do if i were to do that would be to um [lipsmack] i'd i'd start by networking you know and and contact people that i know 

342.50 343.52 B: mhm 

344.81 350.55 A: so i'd probably send out letters or something like that and i'd probably get on the phone and start 

348.14 349.13 B: mhm 

350.56 352.25 A: calling people [lipsmack] 

352.52 358.72 A: to go b- and i'd probably start out working out of my home also um because uh 

356.35 357.37 B: mhm 

358.81 360.74 A: i think it would be hard to 

361.08 367.56 A: uh to to you know to get to set up an office and and incur that expense of course 

366.62 368.20 B: mhm 

367.63 381.53 A: uh if if money were no object i guess there'd be some some merit in in doing that but i think i'd have to specialize i mean i'd i'd have to um i'd have to offer services in 

374.29 375.33 B: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

381.63 390.22 A: those fields that i've um that i've been working in and and not try to cover the waterfront i'd you know i find that too many people when they 

390.39 400.87 A: try to be all things to all people they they're not good at at almost anything and it sounds to me like you've already kind of done that you've already in your with your 

401.40 408.07 A: skills um that you've already uh specialized on wedding gowns and that sort of thing which is 

408.08 411.85 A: and it sounds like you wanna continue you would wanna continue to specialize 

411.37 412.56 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

412.17 415.37 A: yeah i think that's that makes a lot of sense 

416.02 416.98 A: um 

416.82 418.57 B: now what state are you in 

418.40 421.01 A: [lipsmack] i'm in massachusetts so 

419.67 421.87 B: oh okay i'm in ohio 

421.44 428.00 A: ohio yeah well i work in the boston area i work in cambridge and um 

422.04 423.31 B: mhm 

426.86 428.38 B: oh mhm 

428.33 442.27 A: uh as i say someday we're planning to retire on cape cod i have some friends there that um [mn] that consult but this guy this one fellow that i'm thinking of he consults to people that he used to work for 

442.34 455.74 A: um so he he in fact he goes to ohio to consult he's a he he used to be the chief financial officer of a company there and he he goes there to to consult for this um 

442.36 443.88 B: (( [lipsmack] oh mhm )) 

455.86 468.12 A: this fellow and i asked him about traveling from cape cod he said well he said you know [lipsmack] the guy that i work for sends me his private jet [laughter] and he gets in the jet 

465.54 466.72 B: oh 

466.86 467.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

468.09 469.52 B: [noise] 

468.10 474.06 A: on cape cod and gets off in ohio and um that sounds pretty ideal to me um 

471.44 474.42 B: [laughter] 

474.73 481.41 A: because otherwise commuting out of c- you know cape cod's kind of remote and so commuting out of there to 

481.95 485.91 A: centers of [sigh] technology would be difficult um 

485.56 486.90 B: mhm 

488.24 489.39 A: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

488.98 489.76 B: (( hm )) 

490.46 493.31 A: but i don't know it sounds like w- 

493.38 506.20 A: you know the other thing to to make something like this very successful what what would you what would you think about doing in terms of spreading the word and advertising are are there magazines you could you could um publish in or 

506.21 514.18 A: would you would you even want to do that to try to get business from a wider a wider area than your own um 

514.82 517.67 B: i don't think personally i would 

515.64 516.70 A: community 

517.05 517.96 A: uh-huh 

517.74 518.77 B: um 

518.78 524.71 B: i know from the past just simply word of mouth has kept me as busy as i want to be 

524.37 526.41 A: oh that's great 

525.47 526.58 B: so 

526.72 529.10 A: so there must be a lot of weddings in ohio then 

528.50 530.71 B: (( [laughter] )) 

529.50 532.98 A: [laughter] how how long does it take you to do a wedding gown 

532.97 534.12 B: um 

534.38 535.69 B: not very long 

535.74 536.85 A: really 

536.22 539.70 B: [laughter] i hate to say that 'cause it sometimes um 

540.52 548.48 B: well i mean it really doesn't take me that long i could probably do a pretty nice wedding gown in two days two working days 

548.11 549.61 A: [noise] really uh-huh 

548.80 549.85 B: right 

550.11 551.14 B: um 

551.76 556.26 B: but people where i'm around in this area 

556.87 560.34 B: you know i just end up not making that much money 

560.08 560.95 A: uh-huh 

560.87 563.38 B: um which i know that if i 

564.32 569.59 B: did things more in a bigger area or something i could make a lot more money but 

568.76 569.65 A: sure 

569.60 573.94 B: um just where [laughter] i'm kind of like from a hick town area 

573.62 574.52 A: uh-huh 

574.41 575.64 B: so it's 

576.13 579.84 B: sometimes i'm lucky if i make five or six dollars an hour 

579.48 585.94 A: oh dear well that's not enough well if you have more work than you can handle have you thought about raising your prices 

580.25 581.34 B: yeah 

581.55 582.54 B: right 

586.16 587.37 B: um 

588.26 591.91 B: [lipsmack] i just don't really think it'd be feasible around here 

591.52 596.69 A: because you'd you'd too many people just couldn't justify a higher price 

594.92 597.05 B: right right 

596.75 598.67 A: yeah 

598.14 599.26 B: yeah 

598.72 599.95 A: yeah well that's
