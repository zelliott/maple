103.44 106.17 B: so you like to go scuba diving a lot 

106.07 109.47 A: oh yeah i love scuba diving i go all the every chance i get 

107.59 108.49 B: so 

109.17 113.51 B: where exactly is there a place to go scuba diving around missouri 

113.14 117.00 A: well there's some rock quarries and stuff we always fly somewhere 

116.77 118.18 B: (( ah )) 

117.52 122.43 A: we i go to panama city or the caribbean or wherever 

122.14 128.74 B: yeah rock quarries make sense do you get down in there and find a whole bunch of like broken down stuff and 

128.11 130.17 A: yeah yep 

128.98 133.95 B: some stuff people throw away and just all kinds of things down in there 

133.63 135.27 A: mhm and like 

134.33 149.10 B: we've got some rock quarries up here that we always you know there are rumors that if we could get down to the bottom we'd probably find some cars and you know a whole bunch of other stuff but none of us actually know how to scuba dive so we just stick to jumping off the cliff 

149.69 150.96 A: how deep is it 

150.62 155.29 B: [lipsmack] uh probably around fifty sixty foot something like that 

154.26 155.68 A: (( all right man )) 

155.53 156.76 B: yeah 

156.12 158.85 A: somebody that could scuba dive would be able to go down there 

158.40 170.58 B: yeah yeah it wouldn't be too awfully much of a problem it's just deep enough to where you know we can jump off and know that there's enough water down there and actually break us and nobody actually get hurt or anything 

159.63 161.29 A: and if it's clear 

168.03 169.18 A: (( yeah )) 

170.34 171.04 A: (( [cough] )) 

171.08 173.39 A: (( that's cool we uh [mn] )) 

171.77 180.93 B: 'cause you know there's there's no fun in doing extreme sports if somebody's gonna end up getting hurt 'cause i mean i know it's gonna happen sooner or later but it's better to try and be safe 

179.09 180.11 A: (( by accident )) 

180.83 184.01 A: yeah there's no sense in putting yourself in danger 

183.45 190.61 B: yeah i mean though maybe kinda like a simulator type thing so it gets your adrenalin flowing and you know 

189.97 192.93 A: yeah yeah but nothing nothing stupid 

190.90 192.06 B: but you know 

192.65 198.37 B: yeah nothing that's actually gonna permanently injure you or you know really mess you up in any way 

198.23 209.27 A: yeah there's people that dive off these cliffs up a current river you know here around where i live it's basically just a river with a really steep current and people canoe down it and tube down it 

203.77 204.84 B: mhm 

210.29 213.89 A: and then there's people jumping off these cliffs like sixty foot off 

213.91 215.74 A: (( sixty foot up in the area )) 

215.60 216.63 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

216.03 221.15 A: and i was scuba diving and watching them they were missing logs and stuff by just feet 

221.28 222.59 B: jesus 

221.96 225.06 A: and if there's not or stuff in the water and 

225.10 226.66 A: (( people are just stupid )) 

227.02 228.85 B: yeah [noise] gee 

227.87 229.24 A: jump anyway 

228.96 239.59 B: anywhere we go to go jumping like that we always make sure you know 'cause we'll get down in there we'll swim around in the water down below where we're going to hit and we'll you know even if we don't have scuba gear 

237.06 237.92 A: (( mhm you )) 

239.54 247.64 B: you know we'll sit there and just check down underneath it with the little bit that we can see and you know make sure that there's nothing too awfully big in the way 

240.14 241.09 A: (( know )) 

247.67 259.68 B: [mn] but uh we found out not too long ago that if you're jumping from over a certain height the key is to throw off some kinda little rock or something right before you jump to break the surface of the water 

248.34 249.63 A: (( face plant )) 

260.12 266.93 B: 'cause you'll end up hurting yourself you know at least a little bit yeah if you jump from a good seventy five hundred foot 

262.61 263.51 A: really 

266.70 277.85 B: you know the just colliding with the water is it you would think you know it's water it's not gonna hurt too much but you know you'll end up with a a slight staying on your feet and you know 

267.05 267.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

277.56 278.39 A: yeah 

277.80 286.61 B: they might bruise just a light little bit or or anything but it's nothing to just grab a rock toss it off and then jump right after it that way it breaks the surface tension 

286.56 288.39 A: well how big of a rock 

288.17 293.54 B: uh just about the size of your fist maybe even smaller you know nothing too awfully big [noise] 

293.64 297.06 A: well i didn't have any idea about that that's cool [mn] 

296.67 308.96 B: mhm my brother was the one to kind out about uh if you jump from too high without breaking the surface tension you'll end up hurting yourself 'cause he jumped and his knees were sore for a week 

298.17 299.10 A: (( [mn] yeah what did )) 

309.00 317.91 B: 'cause we went to this new rock quarry that a friend of that it had been blocked off for years but a friend of mine uh knew a guy that had a key to get in 

318.03 318.84 A: (( ya )) 

318.21 324.62 B: so we got in there and you know we only got to jump for about an hour or so before somebody showed up and told us we needed to leave 

324.91 332.63 B: but you know there was a big old hundred foot jump there and that was the tallest one my brother had ever jumped off of yeah [lipsmack] 

325.43 326.24 A: (( do )) 

331.81 334.43 A: (( so what's it like falling a hundred foot )) 

335.44 338.45 B: kinda like flying for about a second and a half 

338.82 350.32 B: [mn] you know you just kinda your heart starts racing and i mean it's like it's a great thrill but it's over really quick and you know as as soon as you hit the water and everything 

350.37 360.35 B: just the fall alone gives you the energy to climb all the way back up there and then once you get up there you know the first thing you wanna do is jump right back off and it just 

360.12 368.94 B: it's over so quick but it's so great that's why one day i'm really gonna try skydiving actually get the falling experience for a little while there 

365.90 366.94 A: (( [noise] cool )) 

369.06 372.41 A: so it only takes about a second and a half to go a hundred foot 

369.14 369.70 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

371.99 380.22 B: well actually it takes more like three or four seconds but you know when your your heart's racing like that you know everything seems to go a lot faster 

379.83 383.17 A: yeah it'd be a lot cooler if it lasted a whole minute or something 

382.69 395.43 B: oh yeah that's why you know as i'm saying you know to open some kind of goods store where i had everything i needed to uh you know do some kind of skydiving or something like that like i've seen do you ever watch real t._v. 

385.56 386.28 A: yeah 

395.43 398.71 A: uh my older brother watches it all the time so i know what it is 

398.22 411.28 B: yeah they've got like that show where they show like people sitting there jumping out of a plane with like uh snowboards on and stuff like that using them to help them spin and twist and do all kind of flips and stuff like that 

411.16 413.84 B: i think that'd be interesting to try 

411.23 412.13 A: cool 

414.00 423.87 A: yeah my older brother is into all that he likes any kind of extreme sport and i'm more of just the football and [laughter] swimming type and just like go out in the pool 

423.86 424.88 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

423.96 426.38 A: (( or football football's what i like )) 

424.91 428.12 B: i recently got into where you know i've i've been a 

427.89 433.07 B: i was rather lazy with sports for a while 'cause i wasn't very good at 'em and [mn] now my 

433.02 444.12 B: my wife's son has got to the point to where having all his little friends are starting to play backyard baseball and football and all that so you know i started to play with them so 

439.40 440.27 A: mhm 

444.46 449.94 B: getting into a little bit more shape but the reason i really got into extreme sports was because i 

445.21 446.13 A: (( cool [noise] )) 

449.77 463.85 B: you know i used to watch the x. games stuff like that on t._v. a little bit and i thought it was kinda cool but you know i didn't think it was anything that i would ever actually be able to do really well you know because they've been practicing for years upon years 

460.85 461.63 A: yeah 

463.84 464.59 A: yeah 

464.07 466.43 B: and uh then i uh 

466.53 471.47 B: i met this guy that lives in my uh my hometown his name is seth kimbro 

471.41 482.98 B: he's a professional b._m._x. biker he uh he hangs out on the matt hoffman team he he's you know come in like second place in the x. games several times on the b._m._x. 

474.64 475.87 A: (( cool mhm )) 

483.08 485.84 B: you know and he sat there and he showed me you know 

485.75 491.18 B: just how you know it's not too awfully hard all you have to do is actually sit down and practice you know 

490.99 501.67 B: a little bit you know the reason he got into it was because him and his friends used to just hang out and play on bikes and you know they started to try and show off and he just had a knack for it 

501.46 511.17 B: so if you like extreme sports all you have to do is just you know try a little bit of each one find out which one you just have a little bit of a knack for and then stick with it 

510.49 517.80 A: [cough] yeah my little brother and all his buddies they're bicycle people they like jumping ramps and doing three sixties and flips and all that 

517.26 519.59 B: yeah yeah 

518.09 523.20 A: and he's fifteen and he's had a broke leg and several hundred stitches 

522.99 524.07 B: ow 

523.39 525.44 A: but he loves it 

524.93 526.46 B: yep yep 

525.73 533.96 A: seems like over the last three or four years he's had i bet ya he's probably had five hundred stitches in his legs and arms from where he's just had a wreck 

533.71 537.86 B: yeah well that's what happens but as long as he's having fun you know 

538.01 539.60 A: yeah yeah he loves it 

539.38 544.77 B: yeah sometimes a little bit of pain is the price you play or the price you pay 

540.21 542.48 A: like and i've played six years of football 

544.58 546.26 A: (( yeah that's why )) 

545.00 551.06 B: like last night man i jammed my finger real good last night 'cause i went to a concert up in atlanta georgia 

551.02 551.73 A: yeah 

551.45 557.86 B: and i went to go up my brother's favorite band i don't know if you've ever heard of 'em it's an old industrial band called ministry 

557.96 559.29 A: (( i've heard of 'em cool )) 

559.04 565.09 B: yeah they uh actually were touring the east coast for once so we decided to go see them and you know 

565.25 575.37 B: we got down in the mosh pit and i jammed my finger and my brother scuffed himself up a little bit and you know but i had a great time so i'd say it was worth it 

573.05 573.75 A: yeah 

574.93 579.21 A: i've played six years of football and never had any broken bones or anything 

578.37 583.07 B: i've never broken a bone in my body but i've jammed my fingers quite a few times 

583.91 591.18 A: i got i ended up getting a a broken nose a month after football session was over though and i thought i was 

589.76 591.56 B: oh that's that's irony 

591.88 597.16 A: [mn] yeah and my friend he walked up and sucker punched me 

595.01 595.80 B: uh-huh 

596.80 598.07 B: (( ah )) 

598.17 599.89 A: a thirty year old man drunk and i
