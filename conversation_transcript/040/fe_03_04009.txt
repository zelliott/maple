23.97 25.62 A: very very hot 

25.17 26.27 B: (( wow [mn] )) 

27.08 29.50 A: so how does this work just 

28.36 32.44 B: um well i guess we're supposed to talk about was it perjury would we 

31.55 37.23 A: yeah would we would we commit perjury for a close friend or a family member 

34.52 36.48 B: for a friend i'd probab- 

36.88 41.37 B: well i tell ya i probably would [laughter] i mean it depends on 

39.08 43.31 A: [laughter] i guess it depends what type of perjury it is 

42.48 45.61 B: yeah exactly like what the what's the situation 

43.59 49.28 A: i mean if it's to help somebody out of a bind but if it's perjury like in a court of law 

49.52 51.22 B: yeah that's true 

50.22 54.40 A: that that's a you know i don't know if i i don't think i could do that li- 

53.87 63.13 B: well if it was like a court of law like it was a criminal case and the guy was like you know he murdered you know like a family member murdered someone and i'm trying to s- i wouldn't lie about that 

60.61 61.64 A: right 

62.45 63.41 A: no 

62.93 77.82 B: but if it was like ah maybe like a civil case and maybe like a landlord saying oh the guy never paid his rent on time or whatever you know i might say well you know he's a good guy you know 'cause he's a family member i mean i don't know maybe i'd lie b- bend the truth a little [laughter] 

74.17 75.63 A: exactly 

76.60 81.00 A: but yes um right it's depending on the form of perjury 

80.39 82.17 B: yeah exactly yeah 

81.46 87.35 A: you know and it's supposed to be an l- like you just said a landlord a landlord tenant situation 

86.69 88.28 B: [laughter] 

87.55 89.39 A: [lipsmack] um 

89.40 95.81 A: let's face it [laughter] sometimes we've all been in that bind where we didn't have the money to pay the rent yeah 

93.71 95.17 B: exactly 

95.50 96.82 B: yeah 

96.68 100.08 A: have you had that have you had that come up where you've had to lie for somebody 

99.48 105.64 B: i've n- well i've never been in court other than just being a juror um but just lying for someone i think 

105.66 108.78 B: like i've lied for people as like a reference before 

108.67 109.95 A: yeah 

109.06 118.90 B: you know like i've said oh i've been that person's boss and really like i've only been their you know co worker c- just 'cause they're like a good friend and they left on bad terms and you know i didn't wanna 

117.82 120.44 A: and you know what kind of skills they have anyway 

119.56 121.19 B: exactly so i 

120.47 122.70 A: i i've done that myself 

121.81 126.12 B: yeah so that's like a little white lie i guess we would call that 

125.01 126.37 A: yeah 

126.17 130.14 B: and i'm sure everyone lies on their resume [laughter] 

130.40 134.74 A: yeah well touch it up a bit right [laughter] [laughter] 

132.17 136.44 B: exactly slant it so it's so it's so [laughter] 

136.25 138.08 A: (( exactly )) 

136.81 138.12 B: [laughter] 

138.67 144.19 A: to take the experience you have and turn it towards the job you're looking for [laughter] 

143.79 145.73 B: yeah exactly 

145.11 146.48 A: yeah 

146.45 152.37 B: but ah the hardest thing about this by the way is to keep the conversation going for ten minutes [laughter] 

151.56 153.02 A: that's a long time 

152.43 153.99 B: (( it is [laughter] )) 

153.49 157.50 A: yeah i i talk on the phone all the time too this is my job 

157.07 158.16 B: (( oh wow )) 

157.93 161.06 A: but um it this is a little different [laughter] 

159.76 161.41 B: yeah 

161.08 166.02 A: 'cause usually i'm just like the one doing all the talking telling people how they you know what i mean [laughter] 

163.33 166.42 B: i know [laughter] [laughter] 

166.25 181.00 B: well it's funny the last call i had the lady thought that only she was supposed to talk so whenever like i added my two cents she thought i was interrupting her and she's like oh well let me go back to what i was saying so for nine minutes i was just listening to her [laughter] [laughter] yeah it 

178.89 180.75 A: (( oh my goodness )) 

180.92 182.84 B: was kinda funny 

181.13 182.68 A: [laughter] 

182.69 184.80 A: oh she probably thought that 

184.39 186.67 B: like i was from the school or something 

185.88 188.15 A: yeah like you worked for the 

188.70 190.85 A: the um university there 

189.81 191.67 B: yeah 

190.97 193.52 A: yeah wow [laughter] 

192.66 202.64 B: yeah i figure as long as they have conversation recorded for ten minutes yeah they're just trying to study you know our ah our language and i think our tone of voice yeah 

201.04 201.89 A: voice 

201.90 204.74 A: tone of voice voice patterns that's what i heard 

204.79 208.43 A: so i wonder why they come up with all these different topics does it get people going 

207.01 207.77 B: just 

207.84 210.23 B: yeah just so we have something to talk about [laughter] 

209.84 219.24 A: yes yeah i i was offered one a couple of days ago but i was a little nervous about the topic of conversation so i declined it 

217.73 219.97 B: oh really do you remember what it was 

219.29 221.29 A: yeah it was um 

221.98 227.58 A: [lipsmack] about the iraq war how i've yeah feel about what was going on in the middle east 

223.44 224.67 B: oh wow 

226.16 228.79 B: hm 

228.04 233.21 A: and it always seems to cause arguments so [laughter] i didn't want to touch that one 

230.35 231.70 B: [laughter] 

232.59 233.74 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

233.48 238.84 A: i have several brothers all in the service and yeah so i kinda have a a 

235.66 236.92 B: oh wow mhm 

239.24 244.54 A: a pro ideas of what's going on in the middle east but i don't wanna 

244.90 251.00 A: push them on people who are against it it just doesn't seem right i don't think that was a good choice of topic [laughter] 

246.72 248.40 B: right i understand 

250.45 253.73 B: yeah i don't blame ya [laughter] 

253.56 257.44 A: yeah so what other subjects did you discuss in your other ones 

256.67 263.52 B: um trying to think of what yesterday's was i just already put it out of my mind it was something about 

264.17 270.55 B: oh god i don't even remember isn't that sad [laughter] [laughter] but um 

267.05 268.25 A: [laughter] 

270.72 274.33 B: god i can't remember it i know it'll come to me but um 

274.74 278.76 B: the first one was about um minimum wage i remember that one 

278.54 279.47 A: oh 

278.86 283.12 B: and whether five fifteen is a sustainable amount to live on 

283.32 288.15 B: and i was talking to someone from ah he sounded like a really young guy from wisconsin but 

283.59 284.30 A: (( [mn] )) 

287.59 290.36 A: right and what'd he what'd he feel 

290.22 294.02 B: well he was actually he he was really ah 

294.48 307.47 B: like he was definitely like you know he didn't know much about like what people make and like what what type of budget people need to live on and so i was like well five fifteen seems like an okay number but there's some people that work really really hard you know and they work 

307.43 313.95 B: you know they kinda work like harder than people like c._e._o.s and they only make five fifteen an hour it doesn't seem right 

310.73 312.76 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

313.31 316.11 A: i always wonder if there are people out there who are 

316.17 317.79 A: making it on that 

317.38 318.48 B: (( i know )) 

318.37 321.82 A: on five fifteen i mean when i starting working years ago i'm thirty eight 

321.47 322.21 B: (( mm )) 

322.10 325.33 A: so i mean years ago minimum wage was three thirty five 

325.19 326.29 B: wow that's 

325.36 328.06 A: when i started working but things were so 

329.09 331.02 A: not th- they were so much cheaper 

330.62 331.98 B: yeah 

331.95 337.98 A: we're very expensive i mean i remember the first apartment i rented cost me like a hundred and sixty five dollars a month 

337.24 339.10 B: oh wow [laughter] 

338.11 340.65 A: yeah it's quite a long time ago [laughter] 

340.12 343.38 B: well i'm thirty two and i my first apartment was four hundred a month 

343.25 347.34 A: wow my first apartment was down here in florida though so florida's 

344.18 344.98 B: and 

346.43 347.28 B: (( mm )) 

348.15 353.96 A: quite it's not it's not quite as expensive i have a two bedroom two bath for six fifty two right now 

350.61 351.51 B: yeah 

353.76 354.57 B: (( hm )) 

354.48 355.76 A: which um 

355.86 358.62 A: you know i'm from philadelphia and that's not 

357.45 358.36 B: (( yeah )) 

359.12 362.35 A: m- you don't find apartments this cheap up there [laughter] 

361.89 366.09 B: yeah well boston's outrageous right now so it's it's 

366.11 368.16 A: yeah my best friend's from boston 

367.51 368.43 B: oh wow 

368.45 376.01 B: it's ah i think it's something like i mean i would think a two bedroom right now would probably be like eighteen hundred in the city 

368.62 369.53 A: yeah 

376.40 378.23 B: maybe two thousand 

377.53 378.63 A: (( wow see )) 

378.26 384.93 B: yeah oh i remember yesterday's it was about um comedy what's acceptable and what's bad taste [laughter] it 

384.83 386.48 A: oh okay 

385.45 388.39 B: was a really tough subject to talk about for ten minutes 

388.26 391.48 A: ah yeah i guess so especially people that don't get in to comedy 

391.01 392.44 B: yeah 

391.95 395.47 A: i like stand up that's a big a like that a lot so 

393.79 395.60 B: yeah me too 

396.14 399.33 A: i think the people they should keep politics out of it but 

398.86 400.24 B: [laughter] 

399.98 403.38 A: we're seeing that's happening anyway with like with janeane garofalo 

402.89 409.59 B: oh i know and like you watch like the late shows like letterman that's all they co- that's all they joke about is politics you know 

408.72 411.52 A: that's all they joke about 

410.13 411.64 B: (( [laughter] )) 

412.02 417.31 A: and i don't know does it do- does does it ever make you feel uncomfortable if you disagree with them 

417.48 427.82 B: it sorta does well see comedians they always just poke fun at it so it's not really like you know like the different terror levels when that first came out like everyone was joking about the colors and everything 

426.99 428.38 A: yeah 

427.78 435.34 B: and i'm like you know i think it's a serious issue but like i don't think by them joking about it it did it any disservice or anything you know 

434.00 435.47 A: (( [mn] right )) 

435.70 437.79 B: so yeah i'm okay with it 

437.35 443.61 A: but like with the like with letterman and s- and leno and bill maher he's another one 

443.34 444.75 B: (( mhm )) 

444.38 447.28 A: that if you i actually met him 

446.90 447.89 B: oh wow 

447.60 449.80 A: yeah about a year and a half ago 

450.19 457.35 A: and we were we were talking about stuff in the middle east and he made me feel very uncomfortable and i thought ah 

454.18 455.19 B: huh 

457.76 461.78 A: just because i feel a little different than him he shouldn't make me feel this way 

461.48 462.34 B: (( mm )) 

462.37 463.33 A: (( you know )) 

462.48 466.81 B: well some people are just outspoken and i guess comedians definitely follow in that ah [laughter] 

466.99 470.22 B: you know they definitely they have an opinion and they stick with it 

467.14 468.47 A: yeah 

470.04 473.60 A: yeah but just because they do stick with it i think sometimes it's 

474.16 481.61 A: i dunno like barbara streisand i love her music but she gets on my nerves with all the with the her political viewpoints 

477.97 479.46 B: [laughter] 

480.91 482.30 B: (( [laughter] )) 

481.83 487.67 A: it's like you have to listen to my political viewpoints or you don't get my albums you know [laughter] [laughter] 

486.22 487.20 B: wow 

487.77 489.22 B: [laughter] 

489.63 491.06 B: that's funny 

491.24 497.09 A: i don't know i guess 'cause i grew up in a situation at home where you you didn't talk about religion and politics 

496.99 498.69 B: (( hm )) 

497.48 500.69 A: i think that's why people make me uncomfortable when they talk about it 

500.66 503.85 B: yeah i think you're right 

502.42 511.97 A: because yeah it just seems like no matter what conversation you're in with who the other person has totally different views which is a wonderful thing that's why we all live in america 

508.51 509.70 B: mhm 

511.25 512.53 B: right 

512.64 516.46 A: you know but it just sometimes it can lead to a lot of arguments [laughter] 

515.62 519.71 B: yeah try dating someone who thinks totally different views [laughter] than yourself 

519.47 522.82 A: exactly i've been there done that [laughter] 

520.06 521.05 B: [laughter] 

521.27 526.50 B: [laughter] you know it it's fun for a while and then after that it's like okay you know
