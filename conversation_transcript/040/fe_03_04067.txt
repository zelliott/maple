22.52 26.76 A: probably like a travel business like a 

26.81 33.44 A: like if money weren't an an issue like something like travel related yeah 'cause i like to travel and uh 

30.51 32.40 B: really [laughter] 

33.76 36.26 A: because it seems like they make a lot of money so 

36.05 40.93 B: [laughter] yeah a- actually i i i used to work at a travel agency it's um 

36.36 37.43 A: [laughter] 

40.99 53.09 B: it's probably one of the less glamorous jobs that you can get [laughter] yeah i i know it seems definitely but uh it's it's uh it's it's pretty dry i can say [laughter] 

44.46 46.22 A: oh wow [laughter]

53.07 58.23 B: i don't know so um [lipsmack] i i have absolutely no idea what kind of business i'd open i i 

58.76 66.64 B: guess i'd probably go into software because i love playing around with that kinda stuff all the time [laughter] it'd be nice if you never had to worry about a bottom line or you know

512.47 513.68 A: yeah 

512.49 519.31 B: uh yeah [laughter] it's it's been really interesting i mean these last couple of months just following stuff that i it's i mean 

519.34 521.24 A: yeah 

519.42 530.82 B: the but you aren't generally i mean i mean obviously not like you you need any help for this but like you know i i mean you obviously don't hope for conflict or anything but it i mean it's it's pretty bad when it 

530.92 532.98 B: actually doesn't end up happening so 

532.32 537.10 A: it's funny ever since like the last election it's like politics all over the place you know 

536.36 538.28 B: yeah seriously i mean 

538.33 549.36 B: and and certainly remembering back to like you know two thousand and one when we thought like this stencil research was gonna be like the big like the make or big issue with bush's presidency it was always just like shocking how much 

549.07 550.42 A: wh- the which issue 

550.04 552.63 B: uh the stencil research i mean 

551.87 553.70 A: oh yeah that's right stencil 

552.64 562.41 B: when he did the big like policy address i mean it was like a month's worth of news on that [laughter] but like the the political landscape really has become much more dominate i don't know 

555.19 556.18 A: that's right 

557.13 558.59 A: that's right what 

561.74 570.64 A: yeah i really liked the election actually i really liked liked following like what's what's the next step by step by step and like what's gonna happen next you know 

565.17 566.29 B: oh really 

570.16 572.17 B: the in terms with the two thousand 

571.49 580.21 A: no i mean uh the presidential one when they you know with their big problem i really had a good time with that i'm not i'm not really like into politics i i get into it but i don't like to 

573.82 575.28 B: oh yeah 

579.62 581.05 B: [laughter] 

580.19 587.06 A: you know like i just i never feel like any conversations get anywhere with me 'cause it's they get really just too heated 

583.66 585.16 B: [laughter] 

586.38 599.89 B: yeah no that's true i mean i i myself i'm a democratic but i i have a friends who are republicans here as well and i i just it's really funny 'cause you know you can always you can always have a good fight with somebody [laughter] about it i do you have a favorite 

597.23 598.73 A: [laughter]
