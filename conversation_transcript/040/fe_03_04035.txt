40.07 40.92 A: and that 

43.81 53.10 B: i don't think that i could i i value truth and honesty and what where as i don't have a whole lot of faith in

112.69 117.52 A: oh ah and i've c- been caught in the same situation too uh-huh 

114.51 115.98 B: [noise] 

118.08 120.03 B: (( oops i don't know what that was )) 

119.56 121.18 A: [laughter] i don't either 

120.37 122.85 B: [laughter] [noise] 

121.50 127.78 A: you you're all right though because the only thing is i was a witness in in a trial that happened 

125.90 126.93 B: right 

127.65 128.47 B: [noise] 

127.87 137.11 A: and i know exactly what happened 'cause i saw it and the man that was on trial told it just like that and the next man stepped in and lied 

128.94 130.22 B: [noise] 

131.15 132.37 B: [noise] 

134.27 135.22 B: right 

137.06 138.75 B: right 

137.93 139.42 A: and 

139.48 143.52 A: the guy lost his case and and he was not wrong 

143.55 148.20 A: and his lawyer told him later if you'd a l- if you'd a said what i told you 

143.64 144.86 B: right 

148.38 152.03 A: and the man said well i just couldn't say that because it wasn't true 

152.15 153.58 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

153.11 157.19 A: and and i thought wow [laughter] 

156.40 160.05 B: well i guess i'd say if in this life 

159.82 160.90 A: yeah 

160.24 163.61 B: i was wronged by being honest 

163.24 165.01 A: then what happens next 

163.71 166.77 B: that the lord still knows that it was right 

167.08 168.08 A: right 

167.27 168.88 B: (( and )) 

168.20 172.79 A: you could look at that as just a tri- i mean you know a trial that you went through or 

172.36 173.32 B: [noise] 

173.16 182.77 A: a yeah that ah yeah because what do they say you know anything you do here doesn't really matter to people it it matters to god 

173.90 175.82 B: (( right )) 

180.14 181.16 B: right 

182.55 183.54 B: right 

183.34 184.55 A: uh-huh 

184.47 192.07 B: and it's it's our eternity that we're facing and possibly you know maybe it would be a trial that he put forth for 

192.11 193.03 B: um 

193.39 194.33 B: that 

194.59 199.49 B: that i would that i'd be tested as to whether or not my character 

196.95 198.25 A: mhm 

199.60 200.68 A: right 

199.85 201.19 B: mattered to me 

201.22 206.41 B: or if it was something that i was willing to throw away because i didn't have faith in 

207.19 209.06 B: institutions 

209.09 210.52 A: right 

209.21 211.57 B: um being the legal system 

211.41 212.58 A: mhm 

212.58 215.76 B: (( um and and then there's times throughout )) 

216.26 219.94 B: [noise] there's always times throughout our life where we're faced with 

221.04 230.91 B: what would make things better for us but what's and then what's right and and it's really tempting to say well 

231.14 233.38 B: you know if i say it this way 

233.07 234.06 A: (( yeah mm )) 

233.42 235.82 B: then the the good guy's gonna win 

236.60 244.54 B: but that doesn't make it right and i've gotta uphold to my children that there is a moral right 

244.77 246.03 A: correct 

245.42 253.46 B: um even if it's even if my kids don't see it that's my life has to stand for that that there is a moral right 

253.70 255.06 B: and ah 

255.73 257.44 B: so i j- i just don't think i 

258.31 267.10 B: could um even if it meant difficult situations 'cause i'm sure that sometime in my life i may be faced with 

267.21 270.68 B: a difficult situation like the one you say that you went through 

270.20 284.30 A: yeah because i'm go ah let's let's go to to real real extremes since you say you have children what if one of your children really did hurt somebody intentionally and they were gonna get the death chair for this 

284.40 287.96 A: but all you had to do is say it was an accident 

287.99 288.98 B: right 

289.38 295.32 A: see i don't think i could really answer their question i don't think none of us really know because 

294.41 296.52 B: not not until you're there 

296.13 300.84 A: i could let maybe one of mine go to jail but i don't think i could let one of 'em die 

300.80 302.00 B: mhm 

301.31 304.76 A: but then i know i'd have eternal punishment for the lie 

304.69 305.68 B: right 

305.37 307.42 A: but some mothers would do that 

307.58 308.84 B: right 

308.01 313.64 A: i i yeah i think kinda think that's a loaded question we're discussing because until you're faced with it 

314.19 316.55 A: ah to a real severe height 

316.57 317.60 B: (( [noise] right )) 

317.45 319.47 A: uh-huh but now 

317.76 324.94 B: you know it's just a matter of okay would i go and i perjure myself for a friend or family member because they havn't paid their taxes 

324.00 326.72 A: right no i would not 

325.13 339.75 B: yeah ah no i wouldn't i i absolutely wouldn't do in that kind of an instance um and i don't believe that i would do it in any instance but it's like you said there are those instances where it really tests the human character 

333.45 334.37 A: right 

338.05 347.94 A: down to the core yeah uh-huh ah i think we're about the same type on that because it would take well really really really major something 

340.10 341.09 B: right 

348.05 349.00 B: right 

349.97 350.96 B: um 

350.86 356.60 B: no and and you know if if it came down to one of my kids and it was a matter like you said 

356.42 366.49 B: where they'd serve time well you know they just like i have to face god with what i've done in my life they're gonna have to do that and they're gonna have to face the consequences i'm not doing them any 

356.53 357.24 A: (( mm )) 

360.64 361.66 A: right 

367.04 370.10 B: any favor just by getting them out of something [noise] 

369.74 374.13 A: no i don't think i could i mean i think mine would just have to do the time 

373.93 374.93 B: right 

374.18 384.18 A: it's up that serious serious thing that you never expected there might be one instance where i'd have to say yes i would the rest of the instances i'd say no 

378.11 379.22 B: right 

384.13 385.99 B: right right 

384.83 391.51 A: [laughter] and then i and the one i would be in decision it would be all decided then mm 

386.66 387.70 B: (( and and )) 

391.75 395.35 B: right right well and it would also 

395.69 403.10 B: um i look at i look at some cases where see i believe in like corporal punishment for children 

403.30 410.95 B: well certain states don't don't authorize it they they think that it's child abuse um 

409.74 414.26 A: i i don't ah believe in corporal punishment for minors either 

414.25 420.35 B: well and so the case would be well if you're faced with losing your children to the state system 

420.19 421.27 A: right 

420.59 421.69 B: um 

421.74 422.74 B: well 

422.96 428.87 B: i i don't know i mean that's not that's not committing perjury for somebody else but still that would be 

428.92 431.48 B: committing perjury and um 

430.44 431.36 A: yeah 

431.73 434.30 B: but i i don't think i would either 

434.34 439.67 B: even even in the situation i'd let the the moral ground stand for itself i think 

439.37 440.63 A: yeah 

440.21 444.42 B: again it's when you're faced it do you what do you do 

445.02 446.05 B: and ah 

446.19 447.79 B: so i don't i don't know 

448.29 454.55 B: any any further i mean i i know there has to be situations out there where people say well 

454.63 458.34 B: i mean you see 'em o- on t._v. in situations like that all the time 

457.41 461.79 A: yeah well there are situations that come up that are just 

461.90 466.81 A: totally totally obvious to everyone that it was a deliberate cruel thing 

466.81 467.74 B: right 

467.06 469.88 A: and then there are other situations that come up 

469.90 473.62 A: that it in actuality was an accident 

473.42 474.72 B: right 

474.12 478.52 A: but there was a law like a child that wasn't fastened in their seat belt 

478.38 479.35 B: right 

478.53 482.33 A: everybody knows they're supposed to fasten those children in those seat belts 

482.15 483.51 B: (( [noise] right )) 

482.87 487.48 A: and when one does get killed it is involuntary manslaughter 

487.48 488.45 B: right 

487.55 491.79 A: but it was actually failure to belt buckle the seat belt 

491.64 492.69 B: right 

492.16 494.20 A: you know and morally 

494.29 499.53 A: which one is are there you know is the good lord gonna come down on 'em for you know 

498.69 499.69 B: right 

499.69 513.32 A: and sometimes i i you know i've seen a man on t._v. i don't know of any of the factual parts except what the t._v. said but where a man did just that his two year old was killed because it was not in a seat belt and he's in prison right now for mur- or 

513.49 516.73 A: ah involuntary manslaughter i think they got him for 

516.64 517.84 B: right 

517.27 518.28 A: and 

518.63 527.78 A: that you know he should of done something for it but this man left a wife and three other children and he's in prison for like twenty five years 

528.07 529.36 B: right 

528.76 530.79 A: and it's like now wait a minute 

531.09 537.53 A: he could be out here earning a living for that wife and three kids they could of come up with some other kind of punishment for him 

536.66 546.05 B: well that and the the social deterioration that comes from now i don't know this case from that being away from his other children 

543.50 546.87 A: it was just i don't know him personally right 

546.52 548.71 B: they say that that ah ah 

548.81 553.44 B: that those other children will grow up to be more moral characters 

553.45 557.46 B: if he is there unless he's completely 

557.47 558.39 B: (( ah )) 

558.31 559.68 A: yeah 

559.01 562.07 B: you know um immoral and all that 

560.37 561.45 A: you know 

561.83 573.06 A: this might have been a good man it might have been a bad man because i don't know him it was just a television thing a couple of years ago but it just always got me that boy now something is wrong with the system there 

562.15 562.95 B: um 

567.96 569.02 B: right 

572.83 574.08 B: (( mhm )) 

574.27 576.54 B: well that and somebody who 

576.09 580.02 A: and it is ah you got to stop and take two now there's a life gone 

580.10 581.46 B: right 

580.89 585.98 A: you know but there's really three children that's really messed up now 

582.32 583.61 B: but you know 

586.33 599.89 B: there's something wrong with the legal system though in where everybody there has to be somebody doing paying for something no matter what the case that man is gonna live with the fact that he has killed his child for the rest of his life 

598.32 599.95 A: right
