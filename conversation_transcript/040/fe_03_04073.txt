5.29 8.32 A: and i'm joanna i'm from pennsylvania 

9.72 12.03 B: hello i'm pat i'm from virginia mhm 

11.51 12.67 A: okay 

12.78 13.73 A: uh 

14.30 18.53 A: i i always thought i would like to open a travel agency 

18.98 23.10 A: and i don't even know why i love to travel maybe that's [laughter] why 

23.55 26.54 A: but i would have no experience with it 

26.87 28.48 A: what are your thoughts 

28.27 29.74 B: well i think about 

29.92 34.64 B: opening a business and if it was um up to me it would be a homeless shelter 

34.83 38.50 B: because um i see a lot of um persons 

35.11 35.94 A: ah 

38.83 43.03 B: around um my community that you know that it bothers me 

43.13 45.77 B: that we don't have more shelters 

45.98 48.00 B: to for the homeless even for the winter 

48.44 54.50 B: and the summertime and to be self sufficient and what i mean by that is it would be run by a former persons 

54.69 57.12 B: who were homeless they would will learn skills 

57.13 58.71 B: at at the centre 

58.98 62.43 B: um you know th- if they have a cafeteria that they will run 

62.48 64.87 B: they will learn how to um prepare food 

65.13 70.32 B: um they might have a travel agency in the- inside of there learn how to you know 

70.05 71.10 A: mhm 

70.43 73.52 B: uh they might have a computer center there learn how to use the computer 

73.61 81.28 B: just put themselves back into the community you know as a functioning person that'll be self you know fully self sufficient you 

81.30 84.00 A: that yeah that's an excellent idea 

85.08 87.55 A: have you had any experience in businesses 

87.33 93.28 B: know um [mn] n- no not [mn] not that th- of that nature no uh-uh 

93.52 94.91 B: ((  )) 

93.60 96.37 A: i haven't either and i um 

95.54 105.95 B: major but but i know i would be um successful at it because i would use my um journalism background the skills i have for that and really market it 

103.78 104.85 A: mhm 

106.05 117.73 B: you know i won't would need you need any government money or any city you save the money but i will you know you really whatever you do you have to screen people because people will see something that's good and workable they'll try to you know 

118.61 130.18 B: find a scam out of it you know i wanna to make sure that the persons that are actually in it were actually they were actually homeless they actually you know maybe some of the p- everyone there cannot be employed be a homeless person 

120.01 120.90 A: right 

121.75 122.31 A: (( [cough] )) 

130.08 134.78 B: (( or a former homeless person but [mn] obviously someone who could contribute back to the community )) 

134.80 136.96 A: yeah i agree definitely 

137.86 139.79 A: yeah that's an excellent idea 

137.97 138.65 B: oh 

139.23 140.32 B: (( mhm )) 

140.47 146.15 B: and your travel agencies what er um actually you know would you target for that mm mm 

146.01 150.52 A: i don't know i think it [cough] when my daughter started college several years ago 

150.50 164.33 A: um i said oh i should go with you and take they had courses on travel agency and she said why don't you and i just kinda of you know how many how many senior high school students want their mother in college with them 

164.40 174.24 A: [laughter] but i also wished i'd a done it but ah like i say i don't have a lot of experience i took some college courses when we had to interview 

174.30 180.34 A: somebody that had a job that we admired and i did interview a lady that was uh [lipsmack] 

180.64 187.59 A: uh run a travel agency and i'm sure there's more to it all i see is the glory side and the and the ah 

187.70 191.43 A: the reduced trips you get and all that kind of thing 

191.47 196.07 A: and i know there's a lot more work to it to that but i just think it would be super interesting 

197.51 199.26 A: i think it would uh 

199.71 207.64 A: you could put as much or as little time in it as you wanted as big as you wanted to get or if you just wanted to stay a real small business 

208.78 217.12 A: but uh my husband is self employed so i know from that end of it there's a lot more work to being self employed then a lotta of people know 

216.77 218.60 B: (( [noise] mm right it is it is ah )) 

218.73 220.30 A: a whole lot more 

219.80 224.31 B: with with payroll and what not and taxes and everything that to keep up with 

222.72 223.76 A: right 

224.42 229.68 B: yeah there's it's probably quite a few things you we have to um maintain being self employed 

229.57 231.17 A: i would think so too 

230.72 231.82 B: yeah 

232.45 238.00 A: yeah uh and another thing i often thought about was a daycare center i love children 

238.32 242.54 A: [lipsmack] but i think too that that would take a special kind of person 

242.29 249.60 B: yeah because with all the um you know the the laws of the city and the state and the licenses that you have to have 

249.69 253.26 B: (( and the teachers that have to be certified )) 

252.74 254.55 A: right it 

253.30 264.44 B: um it that takes a lot that takes a lot the type of meals you have to serve i have a girlfriend who u- who did who went into that she went into a i don't care about how long she stayed into it but it it was a lot yeah 

265.05 270.61 A: yeah and it's not just as simply as opening your doors and loving children it's a whole lot more to it yeah 

268.69 269.98 B: (( right mm mhm )) 

270.86 277.52 B: and then you know the insurances that that issue you know make sure the kids were you know well provided for and whatnot 

273.72 274.54 A: yeah 

277.90 281.60 B: and then if a- anybody got hurt then that's a different issue [laughter] mhm 

281.74 283.88 A: yeah boy that would be awful 

284.00 286.44 A: if they got hurt while they were in your care [noise] 

286.04 287.12 B: right 

287.36 289.93 B: so that's why i think uh mm uh 

290.17 296.17 B: working with the homeless shelter you know as buying a site for it because you know sometimes people you 

296.24 299.26 B: know they don't want certain things in their neighborhood and 

299.30 301.15 B: so you have to fight that issue 

300.88 302.48 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

301.30 306.55 B: and you know with the city and the state and [noise] who are the type of people you'd want to um 

306.64 320.84 B: target the type of people you gonna how many people are you gonna service a year or services you know you're gonna provide and then of course you know if something is runs successful [noise] you know the the state or the city they might wanna to come in on it and you know and help with some of the funding 

320.42 321.39 A: right 

320.97 328.50 B: not that you would need them but you know it being if is a successful they might wanna tag in on it because it's in their community and it makes them look good 

328.44 333.41 A: and you would have to have uh [lipsmack] uh preparations for children too 

333.07 334.17 B: right 

334.33 339.29 B: yeah with kids single parent you know coming in 

335.87 336.74 A: right 

339.18 340.26 A: right 

340.68 348.54 B: and you might have i i might have be involved in putting like some kind of schooling together for them could get transition them back into you know the workforce 

348.35 349.27 A: mhm 

348.88 352.33 B: you know transfer the parent as well the kids back into the school system 

351.04 361.99 A: yeah that sounds like it would be really interesting that really fulfilling i think you would feel like you really really did give something back if you could do that 

362.58 364.21 A: yeah that would be neat 

363.83 374.79 B: mhm mhm with all the and then you know with the clothing and what not and show them how to dress and get ready for work and prepare meals and um how to um 

376.42 388.69 B: do their finances as well as paying rent and other things and other things that go with that u- utility bills and whatnot just the whole nine yards 'cause when you're out on the street you know you don't it's not like that you don't have a care in the world but you know you just don't have anything 

378.84 379.89 A: right 

388.57 389.61 A: right 

388.83 395.26 B: you know to fall back on and then how to save your money how to open a bank account how to write a check you know all that [mn] mhm 

394.49 395.72 A: oh yes 

396.32 401.51 A: mm that would be interesting we in a very small way we contribute here uh 

401.94 405.92 A: [lipsmack] to a sal- a salvation army homeless shelter uhm 

405.95 415.63 A: different groups i belong to we collect the little sizes of just the soaps and shampoos and and all that kind of thing and donate to the shelters 

415.71 419.50 A: but that's just a very small thing but they seem to appreciate it 

418.89 423.60 B: i'm sure they do you know you know any small donation you know it's better than nothing 

423.20 424.23 A: right 

423.64 425.58 B: it all contributes to the whole 

426.45 430.08 A: right they have a big job what they do is very important 

429.98 432.39 B: mhm mhm and volunteerism is important as 

432.45 439.35 B: far as you know getting those people you know helping out we we don't have the salaries to pay people to do that sort of thing 

435.37 436.51 A: right 

439.15 440.34 A: (( oh yeah )) 

439.48 444.55 B: and of course it's non profit and non profit they don't it doesn't pay that much you know anyway 

445.05 448.31 B: (( but it has to be a person who's really working from the heart mhm )) 

448.13 451.63 A: [sigh] yeah and all the paperwork that would be involved in that 

452.17 452.77 A: (( [sigh] )) 

453.91 457.06 B: [mn] so all of that will um you know just depends on 

457.15 463.09 B: you know how's house we see you know by the community and whatnot what kind of site you could get for it i think if money weren't an object 

461.72 462.65 A: right 

465.44 466.76 A: right 

467.05 468.35 B: ((  )) 

467.14 470.71 A: (( but [mn] )) 

471.13 471.77 A: [sigh] 

472.45 477.11 B: for other people mhm yeah i- it definitely would be a um an asset not to worry about the money 

476.67 477.70 A: (( right [noise] )) 

478.33 483.44 B: worry about the money but you have to use the right have still have the right marketing tools to get out there 

483.47 485.15 B: (( you know to market your product )) 

484.96 485.82 A: right 

485.44 492.71 B: like for a travel agency i'm sure there are plenty of travel agencies but what can you do [noise] to make yours different from someone else's 

492.60 506.46 A: exactly and maybe because we not that we've travelled a lot but we've dealt with some of them and some i would go back to in a minute because i was so pleased and some i wouldn't and that just kinda tells me what i know i would not do 

493.40 494.54 B: (( right mhm mhm )) 

507.48 508.66 A: but uh 

508.97 512.16 A: it would be a big step but i think it would be fun to try 

511.80 512.71 B: right 

514.01 519.51 B: and you know e- everybody you gotta venture out there because if you don't get out there you would never know how 

519.57 522.50 B: successful or you know failure you are or anything 

522.11 523.17 A: right 

522.58 524.80 B: unless you got out there and tried it 

525.94 527.65 A: that's exactly right 

528.44 531.65 A: and it's not often you get to start y- ah 

531.78 535.46 A: when you can start a business that money is not an object 

536.05 538.46 A: because that's usually the main object 

539.92 542.25 B: mhm that's true it really is 

542.28 543.51 B: but um 

544.32 545.78 B: shortly um 

546.47 551.48 B: i would prob- also have to consider whether we use a building that was already um 

551.65 555.69 B: there or will i have to build from the ground up more than likely i would probably use a building 

555.71 557.37 B: that was not being used 

557.49 560.69 B: in an area where you know that- i would benefit 

560.54 561.66 A: yeah 

560.71 564.63 B: (( that's [mn] assuming i can get get you know [mn] purchase cheaply and then may )) 

564.63 565.58 A: right 

565.72 570.32 A: and then you'd probably still have to do a lot of work to it to make it suitable for your needs 

569.05 580.80 B: right right right with the plumbing and the painting and how many rooms i need for this how many rooms i'd d- need for that need for that and how big a building how many people am i going to you know because i don't wanna turn anybody away 

570.61 571.17 A: (( [sigh] )) 

575.17 576.20 A: right 

580.98 584.35 B: (( but you know it depends on how large a building i can find )) 

584.85 588.88 B: to service th- you know service you know provide the services i need 

588.80 589.77 A: mhm 

590.11 593.72 A: and i'm sure there would be a lot of need for that [sigh] 

592.29 593.28 B: mhm 

593.64 595.82 B: and where would you base your company out of 

595.87 597.10 A: (( ah )) 

597.24 599.95 A: probably not my home there again from experience
