1.12 2.31 A: hello 

2.10 3.45 B: hello 

3.23 5.60 A: hi how ya doing my name's joe 

4.11 4.67 B: (( [mn] )) 

5.50 7.31 B: and my name is too 

7.47 10.65 B: [laughter] and who would like to go first on your idea about business 

10.93 14.79 A: oh i don't know do you have any uh ideas off the top 

14.84 16.42 B: actually i do [lipsmack] 

16.40 30.71 B: uh i live in the uh um west virginia ohio kentucky area and within this area there's a very very uh just a large amount of uh diabetes uh heart disease 

21.52 22.77 A: (( okay okay yes )) 

30.78 44.71 B: uh different types of uh uh blood disease you know like that and ordinary diseases and uh my idea for a a business which i have very seriously thought about opening and i'm still kinda bouncing it around is uh 

44.77 55.26 B: a restaurant chain that would supply uh the patrons with all health food nothing but uh maybe have a dietitian 

55.27 58.39 B: that uh would uh guide the chefs uh 

58.37 70.90 B: in the way of preparing food that would be healthy for everyone because in all too many issues on holidays and and just going out to dinner all too often certain family members due to their illness uh 

70.82 78.80 B: either have to stay home or go out and and have a type of cuisine they shouldn't have or uh settle for less 

78.77 82.25 B: and in uh this type of chain that i'm speaking of 

82.08 91.18 B: this would be something that would be good for everyone uh it's something that you could do i believe without it being terribly pricey 

91.01 100.74 B: uh it would be healthy even even with the the youthful ones who may be taking their grandparents out to eat who may be weight it could be diet uh you know in high in protein 

100.60 108.88 B: uh things that would curb cholesterol or actually lower it i i think it uh that's a pretty good idea especially in this area what do you think 

108.36 113.21 A: [mn] actually i think it sounds like a good idea it's also interesting because i've thought uh 

113.32 116.59 A: in the past i mean i think most people have gone some processes 

118.72 124.75 A: and um [laughter] i've actually thought of you know not specifically for heart disease diabetes that sort of thing but 

124.77 126.53 A: like recently i uh 

126.85 130.43 A: you know the last six months or so i was actually j- joined watch weights 

130.64 141.45 A: and uh you know you get all these frozen meals things like that they sell you know no one really likes that kinda stuff at least from my perspective 'cause uh they just don't quite taste the same as uh going out to eat 

141.63 145.10 A: and uh i've also thought about you know when you think of healthy 

145.17 156.18 A: restaurants and i think about uh you know opening something that would be you know kind of like a weight watchers type of restaurant where you know you don't have to count points you know these things are taken care of for ya 

155.66 159.62 B: absolutely that's the sort of thing that i'm speaking of something that uh 

159.56 173.85 B: that that would uh meet the needs of the uh people who may be overweight uh dietitians uh a right or a d- dietitian right there uh who would uh be even uh choosing right down to the the amount 

173.79 179.72 B: for their portions and uh and just the different a- array of uh types of foods that you could eat 

175.72 176.83 A: right 

179.66 190.63 B: which uh would be uh well i mean you you could actually step up as a patron and maybe even announce what your uh uh what your uh uh problem may be and uh 

189.58 194.11 A: right and have something tailored for you know maybe have different things that are geared toward 

191.36 192.37 B: yes 

193.57 201.42 B: i think that the only other issue uh pertaining to that would simply be location location location 

201.29 216.20 B: i really do i think something like that would go over big around here and i've discussed it with uh my girlfriend before and well a few other people and they're like well no no one's really going to go for that or else the clientele's gonna be so small you're not going to be able to keep the doors open 

201.60 202.70 A: (( very certainly )) 

216.24 217.16 B: but 

216.52 227.85 A: yeah but if you think about it i think it depends on how you market it you know you obviously want to market to the select groups of people that have you know existing problems that they need to work around for health reasons but 

225.50 233.16 B: right i would be willing to bet that there's more people who do have at least one of these conditions in this area than don't 

233.26 239.64 A: yeah but even so i think just the notion of having a healthy restaurant um you know 

239.79 254.41 A: goes a long way i mean you look at the fast food chains for example one of the reasons subway has boomed recently is because of the big gerard thing right you know there's there's a limited selection of places people can go and and uh find that type of you know find something that's uh 

245.62 247.71 B: absolutely yes sir 

253.14 258.80 B: that's very true and and i mean i'm i'm a patron of subway myself just for that reason 

258.19 260.22 A: [laughter] that's the same same with me 

259.77 268.56 B: really is yeah but it went over well and the way i would present it is when you say health food per se it turns people off 

260.83 261.83 A: yeah 

268.56 269.61 A: right 

268.62 283.56 B: but if you come off with something uh a commercial uh uh something in in the way that hey this is some place where we can all go and eat and remain healthy in a smoke free environment i think that the multitudes would just swamp you 

283.39 292.71 B: in a small town just like huntington west virginia i think that that people would just swamp it i think uh a lot of people would really take advantage of that 

291.84 296.48 A: i mean the kids there's just the conception that h- healthy food doesn't taste good right 

296.37 297.68 B: (( right )) 

296.47 309.12 A: so you have to somehow get over that perception and you know i know i've had many healthy meals things like that that uh you know could taste good can you know have tasted good and um it's just getting over that perception 

305.91 307.03 B: yeah 

308.47 316.07 B: absolutely and and myself w- with all the different inflictions that i have had i've had a heart attack and i am diabetic 

315.92 323.72 B: uh a few different other things i mean i i myself here at home have prepared food for myself 

323.38 324.35 A: right 

323.79 334.38 B: uh using these types of substitutes and all that it takes to keep things healthy and and i've been very satisfied with with what i've done myself so i- i've sold myself 

332.41 333.23 A: right 

335.14 339.76 A: yeah i mean one of the one of the challenges though in the restaurant business is just in terms of uh 

340.18 341.30 A: you know there 

341.50 345.20 A: could be a large start up cost things like that depending on how you know 

345.31 346.87 A: how you want to start 

347.17 349.50 B: yeah yeah 

347.22 352.31 A: um you know 'cause obviously there's a lot of equipment oh is that 

349.90 360.07 B: i've given this a lot of thought and and i really when you stop and think about it and of course you're gonna have to have a lot of the same uh types of uh of uh 

360.10 366.43 B: uh you know oven and this and that and all like that that uh all other restaurants do 

366.34 381.02 B: but uh like any other business which i have owned my own business before and i do know that you do have to start off small and then you when you expand you can't expand by one you have to expand by uh three to four or 

380.35 381.54 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

381.17 386.49 B: or else if if you don't that the other will you won't make anything on it because 

386.31 400.37 B: uh uh the running of it will eat itself up it would just eat itself alive you would have to expand by three to four stores rather than just opening one then opening another because the second one would just you it wouldn't 

400.19 404.15 B: it wouldn't pay the taxes on itself by the time you got done paying the help 

404.09 418.57 B: and uh and uh you know all your supplies and and the upkeep and then the running right down to the electrical bill so when you would expand i've learned uh the hard way you would have to expand by like say three to four restaurants rather than then one 

408.68 409.72 A: right 

418.96 428.09 A: it sounds like you've uh you know seriously thought about these things what do you think are deterrents and i mean obviously there's uh you know the financial issue of coming up with the initial cash 

419.05 419.61 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

428.31 432.82 A: all that i mean there are reasons why you feel that you know 

433.25 441.45 A: you haven't made a leap to do something like this maybe because you're there is some portion of probability that it might be unsuccessful or 

441.92 442.77 A: (( you know )) 

443.68 454.61 B: well i i think uh a lot of it in all honesty uh comes down to uh a matter of guts those who are willing to get out there and take the risk and uh learning how 

452.40 453.26 A: yeah 

454.60 457.05 B: to uh find the fundings 

456.97 470.24 B: which there are fundings out there you know small business loans and this and that which you you can lose your butt on if it's not a success but you have to really be positive in their thinking and positive in your uh movement 

470.15 478.45 B: and uh know that you've got a good idea and how to market it and i think that if if you've got that i think you've got a success on your hands 

478.44 479.52 A: right 

480.08 483.74 A: right and do you think there can you think of any restaurants that try to do that 

483.54 494.12 B: i have never seen one in this area yet other than subway itself which you mentioned which uh in the get go with the way the uh health issue 

494.07 500.10 B: wasn't wasn't really really the uh most forthwith issue about subway 

500.42 508.33 B: and then they came up with the commercial as you said again uh about gerard and boom it took off and it took off big time 

506.84 513.79 A: right and they're like the i think the second fastest growing chain right now you know in the u. s. so 

514.87 526.56 B: well you know i mean mcdonalds is probably one of the most successful stores that's ever existed but in the the very you know last few years uh it's it's come to be called com- common knowledge 

526.39 536.76 B: that uh mcdonalds is probably the most unhealthy place you can go to eat the big mac is there's more calories in a big mac than any other sandwich on the market and it's 

531.32 532.34 A: (( right [mn] )) 

535.78 536.75 A: uh it 

537.07 538.53 B: it really has 

539.06 547.82 A: it has but like the thing the reason i mean they're they're big claim to fame is just in branding i mean they're masters of branding and just putting the big uh 

548.08 551.24 A: you know the big arches in everyone's heads [laughter] 

550.38 553.81 B: absolutely yeah marketing means a lot 

551.46 552.37 A: yeah 

552.40 554.87 A: they they take a different approach 

554.41 561.44 B: yeah yeah everyone has to have their own individual approach i couldn't agree with you more but uh 

561.30 571.28 B: i mean i've i've thought of several different things that i thought might take off but uh i'm i'm i'm convinced after owning my own small business once which was one 

571.18 577.74 B: which uh i had contracts with uh some of the bigger restaurants around here and going and refurbishing the floors 

577.54 578.64 A: mhm 

577.58 586.22 B: and stuff like that and it took off and and really did well i mean the first year out we knocked down like fifty three grand it was pretty decent you know for starting off but 

586.24 595.09 B: but i have a uh very bad back i've got two uh vertebrae in my back that are just disintegrating and and it just to where i couldn't do it anymore 

592.47 593.99 A: that's pretty critical 

595.55 596.81 B: so it would have 

596.00 598.16 A: yeah that's what's tough 'cause actually
