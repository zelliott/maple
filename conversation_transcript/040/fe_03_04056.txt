96.95 106.59 B: and it's hard i know it's you know it has its challenges but i don't like uh i usually the people i've worked for i've worked for small companies and the people i worked for i always felt like i could do a 

106.54 114.87 B: better job [lipsmack] so i guess what we're supposed we're supposed to talk about if you open your own business uh you know what kind would it be i think that was the question 

114.21 115.98 A: right what kind 

115.43 123.32 B: and what and if you felt you'd be successful at it and i didn't write down i didn't take notes [noise] so [lipsmack] um maybe you did 

122.03 122.59 A: (( [mn] )) 

122.70 130.40 A: that's exactly what it was i mean whether w- what type of business and whether we think we would be successful at it 

129.61 133.96 B: so what since you haven't done it before if if you did even though you're 

134.08 137.03 B: think- contemplating it what kind would you open [sigh] 

136.79 140.51 A: mhm i believe i would um 

140.61 147.69 A: i would be interested in the idea of opening a um some sort of 

147.77 150.78 A: work out place gym 

149.79 150.59 B: uh-huh 

150.85 152.15 A: where 

152.35 156.87 A: martial arts and special and uh personal defence 

157.03 167.23 A: um would be would be taught and that would be the main uh the main focus along with with um you know uh 

167.98 170.25 A: [lipsmack] physical training and uh 

170.73 172.56 A: and that sort of activity 

172.09 174.35 B: mhm so is that a hobby of yours now 

174.62 179.76 A: it's [mn] a little more than a ha- uh than a hobby it's it's more of a 

178.34 180.27 B: (( something you- you're involved in )) 

180.19 182.15 A: right yes it's 

181.31 182.18 B: okay 

182.61 187.32 B: but on a on a uh a recreational basis it sounds like it's 

187.52 193.35 A: a little more than that i mean i on a recreational basis yes because i i don't make 

192.21 194.80 B: not a business for you now obviously 'cause that's 

194.06 199.26 A: not a business exactly exactly so yes it is a recre- on a recreational basis yes 

198.48 199.40 B: okay 

199.51 202.86 B: so um what do you think you'd be uh 

203.17 204.92 B: successful at it 

204.26 208.18 A: [mn] i think i would be successful at it because um 

208.33 209.31 A: uh 

209.34 211.51 A: mainly because i am 

211.69 212.82 A: uh 

212.88 216.35 A: i know exactly what someone um 

216.43 224.29 A: needing that service or or being involved in that activity is looking for and um 

224.73 238.59 A: [lipsmack] and i myself would be would be there all the time so that being one of the most necessary uh parts of of um owning a suc- successful business 

239.71 242.83 A: in which the service is provided um 

242.99 247.68 A: you know i think i think i i'd i would have that those those two um 

247.78 251.20 A: uh elements covered by 

249.92 250.78 B: (( mm )) 

251.31 258.70 A: me being a part of it not only an active part but also uh making a a constant active presence 

258.45 259.88 B: mhm 

259.88 263.32 A: so yes i i believe i would be successful at it 

263.09 271.46 B: okay i there were three or four questions that i heard and i didn't write them down [laughter] so i don't know if that did did you write down the question when they when they put ya on the phone 

271.28 275.83 A: no i did not but i really that's all i remember 

275.92 276.96 A: um 

277.50 279.17 A: the topic being 

278.63 283.84 B: okay 'cause i i thought there were there were like four questions they rattled off um 

284.63 285.87 B: before 

286.01 287.55 B: and uh 

288.21 291.88 B: you know so uh that's all i wrote down [laughter] 

290.83 294.52 A: so would you would you consider opening a different business 

294.42 308.00 B: well i have i have my own businesses now i have i kinda have become a um [lipsmack] of gosh like a consolidator i've got four or five companies that i sell different marketing uh tools for 

307.78 308.62 A: uh-huh 

308.06 314.04 B: mostly internet related [lipsmack] and so i'm basically i basically have my own business right now 

309.80 310.65 A: okay 

314.12 319.43 B: and uh so that's you know once i'd had my own business i i realized uh 

320.15 324.12 B: i couldn't you know i could probably never go back 

324.06 324.98 A: right 

325.68 331.54 B: to working for someone else although i have a part time job too and i hate it [laughter] 

330.90 333.14 A: i understand well 

332.01 333.88 B: (( i absolutely hate it )) 

333.26 335.31 A: are you successful at your business 

335.08 340.94 B: um yeah we're starting to uh you know the one product is starting to you know kinda get some traction 

340.83 341.80 A: mhm 

341.21 342.35 B: uh 

343.62 350.65 B: so yeah it it looks like it's gonna within you know the thing is once you even once you make the sale in in what i'm doing it take it could take 

350.73 355.47 B: you know two or three months to see you know some income from it so it's kinda [sigh] 

355.99 365.81 B: uh you know it's not for everybody that's for sure and and if you're used to a regular paycheck it really isn't for you [laughter] and if you have if you have to you know if you can't 

358.57 359.39 A: right 

363.22 364.18 A: right 

365.79 380.71 B: do without that it's uh it's a definite challenge for most people and most people [lipsmack] uh you know they they uh get into it and they don't realize how much of a job it you know it's kind of a job having a a business basically [lipsmack] 

380.17 380.99 A: right 

382.00 385.03 B: um so that's you know that's not 

385.40 396.94 B: i mean it's it's okay with you know i'm i'm okay with it but i know most people wouldn't be 'cause it it's you know on a certain kind of a thing in fact even when i had my court reporting business i you know the lawyers 

389.24 390.01 A: right 

397.25 405.45 B: i worked for lawyers and lots of times i the bills always went to the lawyer but the lawyers sent them on a lot of time to their clients and it would i would never know 

405.34 412.26 B: when i was going to see my money so i had to have a lot of money [mn] into the pipeline to make sure i had some money [mn] 

412.28 414.67 B: coming out the other end 

413.68 415.12 A: right 

415.33 417.43 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah i )) 

415.33 416.55 B: yeah 

417.72 420.81 A: i know exactly how that works 

419.39 422.47 B: and i'm what what kinda business do you work for now 

423.55 427.83 A: mm i am a translator an interpreter um 

426.57 427.54 B: (( oh okay )) 

427.92 431.20 A: so i've worked along with court reporters a lot 

430.51 438.63 B: i you know that's interesting 'cause i the good i don't know i as- i'll i'll assume you're a good one but i remember working with many bad ones that would 

438.71 449.13 B: you know they wouldn't change the uh from first person to t- they would kinda put it he said this and instead of and that was oh that used to drive me crazy 

445.00 446.22 A: exactly 

448.53 449.50 A: yeah 

449.21 456.92 B: and i thought wow you guys need to go back to you need to learn how to do this and then well the worst ones were the ones that would talk with the witness for 

452.95 453.91 A: right 

457.33 462.91 B: you know five minutes and then the answer would come back yes [laughter] 

460.71 462.66 A: [mn] yeah i know 

462.70 471.98 A: i know i i get you know i gotta lot of comments you know um in the lines of oh my god you know w- what a 

472.18 479.64 A: what difference you know what a big difference it is to work with someone who knows what they're doing and um 

479.15 480.86 B: especially in the legal field 

480.64 482.10 A: right i mean it's 

481.09 488.09 B: you know it's one thing to just do that for a con- you know so that the person can converse in a normal setting just in a regular conversation 

487.94 488.85 A: right 

488.13 491.77 B: but it's a whole other thing to do it in a legal [lipsmack] setting 

491.80 497.02 B: 'cause the lawyers want it verbatim they don't want about they want it verbatim 

496.91 498.05 A: exactly 

497.40 502.69 B: and it's pretty obvious when you know you c- the the interpreter carries on a five minutes conversation 

502.99 508.11 B: [lipsmack] and comes back and says yes that they're not interpreting everything that person said 

503.28 504.22 A: right 

507.27 509.36 A: yeah it's very obvious 

508.41 511.18 B: they're kind of paraphrasing it 

510.61 512.95 A: yeah it's very obvious it's in- 

512.94 519.63 A: interpreting especially court interpreting legal interpretations have come a long way 

519.52 522.76 A: and um you know in many cases 

522.53 527.72 A: lawyers won't work with you unless you're certified by the state and so on so 

527.49 538.12 A: you have to i mean it's it's got to the point where you can't work work at it if you if you don't know how to do it it's getting there 

537.57 538.86 B: mhm 

538.24 542.13 A: not quite there yet but it's it's getting there 

541.98 544.52 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] [cough] )) 

542.92 544.73 A: yeah 

544.64 558.40 A: but see that's the thing i mean i i would not wanna open my own business in that and and it's a service i provide and and i consider myself very good at it and um 

551.55 552.91 B: (( right mhm )) 

558.50 565.61 A: but dealing with to to have to deal with all that entails being an owner 

565.45 579.51 A: of a company of that sort it just doesn't appeal to me at all i would much rather you know be a part of a team i would much rather you know have a have a boss and that's just but of course we're you know 

579.92 587.51 A: we're all different and that's what probably makes makes it a a more a somewhat bearable place 

581.02 582.29 B: right 

587.25 595.90 B: right well especially when you're dealing with uh a person that you know i know i what's what's the female male breakdown in your business as far as 

588.05 588.97 A: (( you know )) 

596.26 597.68 B: that do that 

597.39 599.89 A: well um i
