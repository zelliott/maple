0.41 3.48 B: hi this is tammy who am i speaking to 

1.93 3.02 A: hi 

3.33 4.52 A: this is kelly 

4.34 5.75 B: hi kelly [laughter] 

5.35 6.77 A: hi [laughter] 

5.95 10.66 B: i understand uh we're to talk about starting a business would you like to start or should i 

10.34 11.81 A: um you can go ahead 

11.66 18.37 B: okay um i think it's a really interesting topic um i have thought about starting a business i 

18.52 21.34 B: if i were to start a business i [sigh] 

21.47 27.21 B: think i would start um a retail business like i would probably 

27.52 31.48 B: sell like uh d._v._d.s or books or something like that 

31.28 32.13 A: uh-huh 

32.16 38.01 B: i i just because i'm in florida and and retail business is the only thing that's making any money here right now 

37.76 38.94 A: oh wow 

38.61 42.05 B: i mean i would have to maybe kind of do some 

42.24 44.16 B: surveying or 

44.41 49.49 B: you know i i guess i would want to have some basis for knowing for sure that that would sell 

49.15 50.20 A: mhm 

50.00 51.37 B: but um 

51.49 55.41 B: i mean i don't know what it would be like in other parts of the country but i know that here 

55.62 65.23 B: the service related businesses are really having difficulties whereas the retail businesses are doing fairly well because we're still getting a lot of tourists here 

65.00 70.64 A: oh i'm from i'm from baltimore and pretty much anything goes up here 

66.06 66.91 B: so 

70.27 72.20 B: oh well [laughter] that's good 

71.03 72.67 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

72.11 85.80 B: that's good i we've we've had some effects from the economy um which would of course have to affect you know the amount of money it would take to start a business and also would have to affect whether you'd be able to keep the business going in a profitable way [mn] 

85.14 87.32 A: right that would be my concern 

86.95 98.70 B: w- exactly exactly because um even if you have the money to start it um and you can afford to lose it if you can't keep it going then you know i don't think you'd be considered successful [laughter] so [laughter] 

95.87 96.79 A: right 

98.03 100.18 A: no not at all [laughter] 

99.74 104.68 B: um you know i don't i think too um i would want to look into 

104.72 115.95 B: um what the prevailing rates are in terms of what i would have to pay people to work in the business and that kind of thing because i think that could have an effect too if if i were unable to get the right kind of people 

115.97 118.69 B: to work in the business then i don't you know 

117.22 118.13 A: right 

119.61 120.53 A: yeah that's 

119.71 123.09 B: i i i don't know if that's a problem up there but 

123.18 124.77 B: it can be here 

123.19 124.24 A: um 

124.61 133.21 A: well yeah i think well we have a lot of people that own their own businesses up here and it seems they do well but you have to wonder if you're going to be over saturating 

133.21 134.15 A: or 

134.11 148.97 A: if you have enough clients or or customers in my area mainly service things go because people are so busy up here like errand services or um secretary services um those kinds of businesses do well up here 

148.88 150.93 B: right yeah yeah 

149.10 149.80 A: uh 

150.33 153.76 A: but i would be a little nervous starting my own business because 

153.98 156.36 A: it's just such a big leap [laughter] 

156.00 169.91 B: it is a very big leap but i think you have to a lot of self confidence to do it and i you know whereas i have seriously considered it uh with the economy the way it has been i've been kind of hesitant i don't know if um 

169.97 181.62 B: [lipsmack] it would be possible to do it you know on a trial basis while still working or if you would have to just jump in i would be a little worried about trying to do it on a part time basis that you wouldn't really get a good 

181.70 184.67 B: um you know reading on whether you were 

184.74 186.75 B: selling or or you know 

186.89 192.02 B: i i just think it would be difficult so i'm i'm thinking you would have to just jump right in and 

186.93 187.82 A: mhm 

192.15 195.04 B: and um risk your money [laughter] and 

194.58 195.86 A: [laughter] 

195.13 200.39 B: um you know i i do i have noticed in the papers here that there 

200.44 213.83 B: seems to be a lot of demand for i mean and and this is strange but a lot of demand for like used books and um text books and things like that there aren't a lot of bookstores here 

213.45 214.64 A: oh really 

214.13 217.86 B: but there are a lot of retired people who have a lot of time to read 

217.76 221.09 A: wow you would probably do great in a business like that then 

220.81 230.60 B: so yeah i wonder if if you know that would be successful here the only real bookstore we have here is barnes and noble and they don't carry a lot of titles especially titles that are out of print 

230.81 231.73 A: wow 

230.82 236.01 B: and a lot of these older people you know the stuff they're looking for is not the current stuff 

235.56 237.61 A: right right they want the older stuff 

237.17 240.76 B: they want the older stuff yeah and a lot of them are going back to school 

238.09 239.23 A: (( [laughter] on a part time )) 

241.06 242.11 A: (( basis and so they )) 

242.61 244.34 B: (( really well textbooks )) 

244.42 247.10 A: (( want textbooks oh do they )) 

246.55 248.07 B: (( do well up here also )) 

247.62 253.26 A: yeah oh yeah you can oh yeah clean up if you would sell to college kids if you put a ad in the paper 

253.29 256.50 A: you would just clean up because they're so expensive 

256.24 264.28 B: oh i know when i was in graduate school i spent a lot of money on textbooks and you know maybe i would do well at a business like that just because i'm familiar with books 

264.01 264.96 A: mhm 

264.99 275.66 B: you know i think maybe that would have to do with your success in a business too would be whether you do a service or a retail would be if you have some knowledge of what you're doing 

275.49 276.74 A: exactly 

276.27 282.29 B: because i do think a lot of people try to just buy a franchise or start a business in something they don't know anything about 

281.55 288.23 A: exactly and most of those end up failing yeah you can't sell a product or a service unless you know what you're doing 

284.43 286.19 B: yeah [laughter] 

287.84 294.82 B: that's right even something like books i mean people who are buying them want you to know when they ask questions and so 

292.80 294.03 A: exactly 

295.08 300.31 A: when i walk into a bookstore i want someone to be able to tell me something not have to look it up myself 

295.12 296.17 B: i don't know 

300.02 302.56 B: oh it's hard to look up that kind of stuff 

302.22 303.39 A: mhm 

303.09 311.71 B: i mean even if you go into you know a big bookstore like a college bookstore and starting asking about names of books and authors and it's very difficult 

312.04 313.27 A: (( yes it is )) 

312.19 318.49 B: so yeah i would wanna be able to at least provide some sort service if i were going to have a business along with selling the product 

318.09 319.60 A: mhm 

318.87 329.69 B: so i don't know i think there's a lot to consider you know in in getting into something like that and i think you know there are a lot of things that might be different in different areas for example here 

329.89 334.81 B: the cost of renting space is very minimal because there's so much space available 

334.53 335.64 A: (( oh )) 

335.26 339.65 B: but i'm guessing that in other parts of the country it's probably just the opposite 

338.95 341.32 A: it is just the opposite [laughter] 

340.60 344.13 B: that it would cost you a lot of money to rent space up there i mean 

343.35 344.70 A: absolutely 

344.32 350.27 B: yeah and see it would be really inexpensive here so your costs of running a business would be less here probably 

349.91 350.91 A: mhm 

350.92 358.80 B: so i mean [laughter] plus our tax rates are pretty low and i that's something you have to consider i guess is you know what you're gonna pay in taxes so 

359.17 362.73 B: i i just think there are many many things to consider [laughter] 

362.66 364.07 A: absolutely 

363.48 367.68 B: but i think there are many good books out there which would be of help in the subject 

367.05 370.09 A: [laughter] and you could sell those books in your store 

368.00 369.07 B: [laughter] 

369.70 371.21 B: yeah if you could just uh 

371.31 376.13 B: find the time to read them all you know and i'm sure there's a lot of information on the internet 

375.92 377.18 A: oh i'm sure 

376.77 379.91 B: um not all of it which is probably extremely reliable 

380.28 383.25 A: no you do have to watch the internet sometimes [laughter] 

382.59 384.76 B: [laughter] yes i would think so 

384.79 393.47 B: but still in starting a business i think you'd wanna look at anything you can get a hold of that would be useful in you know at least providing a point of view 

393.62 394.59 A: mhm 

393.97 396.55 B: as to what you should do or how you should do it 

396.90 400.36 B: because i mean i've never run a business of my own before 

400.15 401.37 A: no me neither 

401.28 408.48 B: so you know while i know some of the things that might be involved because i've worked in retail management i don't know a lot of things 

408.67 413.60 B: because i would think it's very different if you have your own business and it's a small operation 

413.34 418.95 A: right you'd have to probably hire somebody to do your books and make sure you're keeping it legal 

413.93 415.30 B: then if you know 

416.80 421.17 B: right then if some big chain store who has all their procedures in place and 

421.00 422.11 A: right 

421.70 424.52 B: you know you'd have to develop all that yourself 

425.19 429.12 B: and you're right i mean you'd probably have to hire somebody to do your books and [laughter] [sigh] [mn] 

428.59 431.71 A: sure and make sure you're keeping everything legal [laughter] 

431.32 435.50 B: right right because you know you can't be in business and uh 

435.67 449.11 B: and not pay attention to what you know the tax laws are and and you have to ha- i mean i don't know what it's like there but here i mean you have to have a license from the city to operate a business you have to have a sales tax permit from the state and 

448.93 450.37 A: it's the same here 

449.81 450.75 B: is it 

450.39 451.53 A: i believe 

451.49 456.44 B: oh so you i mean you just can't walk out and say oh today i'm gonna start up a business 

455.87 457.19 A: exactly 

456.48 460.94 B: [laughter] and then just start it up without going through some hoops first [laughter] 

461.11 472.64 B: i mean you really have to check into this to find out what it is in your area because i know when i lived in minnesota it was completely different in a lot of those small towns up there they didn't even require you to have a license 

469.26 470.19 A: (( yeah i think )) 

472.56 473.60 A: wow 

473.18 477.12 B: to run a business you did have to have a sales tax permit from the state 

476.68 478.20 A: but no license 

477.57 484.35 B: but no license from the s- most of those towns around where i lived were so small you know they wouldn't even think of something like that [laughter] 

483.20 490.63 A: well here in baltimore i mean if you if you try to sell food at a flea market or something you have to have a license though i mean they're like license crazy 

490.18 502.00 B: yeah it's pretty much that way here too i mean if you're a temporary like if you had a garage sale you wouldn't need a licence but if you were going to start a business in a physi- permanently physical location which i assume 

496.08 497.45 A: right right 

502.15 507.77 B: if you were going to start a business that's probably what you want to do [laughter] you would r- you would have to have a licence 

508.11 517.98 B: and you would ha- you know you'd have to sh- you'd have to have someone like you said either hire someone to do your bookkeeping or have some sort of record keeping to show where you got your inventory from and 

518.03 524.83 B: you know because they're going to check into that kind of thing [laughter] so i mean you'd have to be somewhat careful i would think 

520.64 521.61 A: right 

524.87 527.10 A: i wouldn't even know where to begin on that 

526.49 530.77 B: [laughter] like i said i think it would take a lot of research to know where to start 

530.37 531.77 A: absolutely 

531.43 538.44 B: because that's the the most overwhelming thing i think about starting a business it's just there's so many facets to it 

538.63 540.31 B: you'd almost have to like 

540.59 544.24 B: make an organization book or a chart or something 

544.01 545.11 A: mhm 

544.38 546.71 B: to make sure that you covered everything 

547.19 552.02 B: because if you didn't you might accidentally slip up and not get some certain licence or 

552.06 553.01 B: you know 

553.55 555.70 B: something like that and then uh 

555.81 557.82 B: you'd be in trouble down the road 

557.43 566.05 A: yeah ex- [mn] yes big trouble especially with your taxes if it were a tax thing i know a lot of our colleges around here offer classes on how to start a business 

561.32 562.37 B: yes 

565.63 567.29 B: oh do they really 

566.65 568.10 A: mhm 

567.49 572.07 B: oh that would be really helpful if you're you know because they don't do that here 

569.09 570.06 A: yeah 

571.78 572.74 A: really 

572.27 578.16 B: i remember them doing that in minnesota in like the technical colleges and the community colleges 

577.51 578.75 A: mhm 

578.28 581.37 B: but they i haven't noticed that they do that here 

581.38 583.27 A: yeah that that would be helpful 

583.00 586.77 B: but i would think that you know there probably 

587.25 588.65 B: i don't i don't know i 

588.95 592.07 B: there may not be a lot of people here who are interested in that 

591.86 592.70 A: uh-huh 

592.43 596.42 B: because i would guess a lot of people who come down here to start businesses come from up there 

596.27 598.10 A: oh right so they already know [laughter] right 

597.37 599.89 B: they already know yeah [sigh] they already know
