0.32 1.51 A: hi 

2.00 3.97 A: hi peggy my name is burt 

3.88 4.91 B: hi 

4.66 5.78 A: (( how are you )) 

5.72 7.25 B: (( okay [noise] n- )) 

6.50 9.64 A: okay so our topic is ah 

9.65 13.75 A: do we think that we would ever commit perjury for a friend 

13.75 16.14 B: no i don't think i would 

15.58 19.95 A: [laughter] that's what i say too and i guess we're supposed to discuss that 

19.43 22.67 B: yeah [laughter] i know i sure wouldn't 

20.84 21.95 A: yeah 

23.29 37.68 A: i agree i can't think of um i i as far as i can say now i would not i i can't think of any situation that i because i'd tend to think i'd be doing more harm than good in the long run mm 

29.13 29.93 B: (( right )) 

35.50 36.77 B: right 

37.63 38.67 B: right 

39.39 42.32 B: and that ah yeah and um at this 

42.67 46.89 B: ah i w- you know a friend wouldn't ask you to do that 

47.04 48.13 A: excuse me 

48.05 50.66 B: a friend would not ask you to do that 

49.95 59.19 A: well that's true it couldn't be much of a friend i don't know i can't recall if they said friend or family and family member but i think it was just friend i'm not sure 

51.76 52.64 B: no 

59.08 73.57 A: but and i guess now because the topic's hypothetical we have to kind of think of like what kind of situations would arise that w- would happen that would make us even think this and i i'm thinking like say 

59.18 60.25 B: yeah 

63.28 64.30 B: yeah 

71.33 72.50 B: yeah 

73.88 80.39 A: oh i don't know what my friend could have done but somehow oh [laughter] i don't even 

78.99 80.00 B: [laughter] 

80.78 86.98 A: know can't think of i i let's say they were at the wrong place at the wrong time 

81.35 81.95 B: (( ah )) 

86.32 87.93 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

87.32 91.54 A: and they hadn't really robbed the bank [laughter] and then the bank 

89.80 90.73 B: (( [cough] )) 

92.03 93.87 A: somebody identified them 

93.92 95.26 A: and 

94.07 94.96 B: uh-huh 

95.60 104.96 A: i guess let's say we were also in the bank no i'm i'm go- and would we commit perjury now i don't know if we told the truth we'd be okay 

104.93 106.54 B: yeah [laughter] 

104.99 114.04 A: and i'm try- [laughter] i'm not getting anywhere with this one [laughter] ah as far as ah well i guess we'd have to say the friend did it then 

108.73 109.51 B: (( [laughter] )) 

114.02 115.59 B: (( [noise] )) 

114.19 117.25 A: she did rob the bank and ah 

116.24 117.28 B: yeah 

117.30 120.08 A: you know but her baby was starving 

119.56 125.71 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

120.35 123.61 A: would that give us a reason to um 

124.26 131.45 A: you know ah commit perjury to save her so she wouldn't have to go to jail and you know so she could stay with her baby 

126.75 127.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

128.36 129.23 B: right 

131.47 140.31 A: and i guess i if i'm a good friend i would say i won't lie for you but i'll take your baby when you go to jail [laughter] and take care of your baby 

131.52 132.57 B: right 

132.99 133.88 B: yeah 

137.78 139.45 B: [noise] 

140.52 147.97 B: well i would um god that's so hard that's a hard question [noise] um 

145.99 149.44 A: are you getting a b- a lot of interference on your phone mm 

149.51 154.12 B: no but do you know i guess i'd better get go get a good um 

154.27 161.65 B: ear bud again 'cause this one's for some reason everybody says that um it makes a noise 

161.19 163.83 A: i'm hearing a lot of noise yeah 

163.18 166.57 B: ah should i take it off and just talk on my regular phone 

166.50 169.36 A: i don't know is it would it take long to do 

166.72 168.00 B: my cell phone

177.38 179.17 A: yeah that's much better 

178.97 182.27 B: (( okay i don't know what's wrong with these dumb things )) 

182.08 183.78 A: yeah now back to the 

182.94 186.29 B: i i think you have to really have an expensive one 

186.00 190.74 A: uh-huh that could be so so can you think of any 

187.02 188.00 B: you know 

188.81 189.74 B: yeah 

190.83 195.10 A: any hypothetical that we you could come up with as to 

191.22 192.05 B: (( [sigh] )) 

192.73 193.85 B: that's better 

194.13 195.52 B: perjury 

195.65 200.56 A: yeah to commit that we would commit perjury for a friend or or you would 

196.45 197.45 B: um 

201.39 205.97 B: i'm really not sure what the work perjury is actually 

204.69 205.47 A: [laughter] 

205.78 208.78 A: ah yeah as far as i know it's just lying under oath 

208.82 210.65 B: oh yeah um 

208.98 219.71 A: when you're on the stand and they swear you in and you you put your hand on the bible or however you do it you know and you raise your right hand and you say i swear that you know that i agree to tell the truth 

218.18 226.10 B: well i would just tell the friend that um i couldn't really lie for him but i could tell the reason why 

226.12 229.35 B: the circumstances was there 

229.24 231.09 A: yeah yeah 

230.39 232.52 B: you know because 

233.09 236.86 B: committing perjury could get me in a lot of trouble 

236.16 238.38 A: well that's true i mean it 

237.73 244.02 B: and and i would have to explain to the friend that ah even though 

244.87 252.28 B: it was wrong for him to do what he did i c- still can't um get him out of trouble 

251.99 253.22 A: yeah 'cause it 

252.48 253.54 B: for lying 

253.41 258.87 A: yeah and i'm sure depending you know that you we would be doing our friend a favor 

258.83 261.90 B: right we wouldn't be doing him any favors 

258.97 260.32 A: by lying 

261.43 262.83 A: yeah because 

261.99 269.04 B: actually be harming him more and then we'd end up in jail for lying if we got found out 

266.91 278.02 A: yeah and ah if this friend actually did do i'm assuming it's some sort of a crime if we're you know on the stand committing perjury um 

271.32 271.95 B: (( [cough] )) 

275.28 277.06 B: right burglary 

278.29 281.28 A: ah i think that if we lie for him 

281.37 291.94 A: or her we're not doing them any favors because they're gonna think wow i got away with it assuming that we're so important to the case that you know that case is decided on our perjury 

286.52 288.28 B: yeah yeah 

289.33 290.41 B: right 

290.97 291.81 B: right 

291.91 302.03 A: and so that's not helping that person any i mean that's like we don't lie for our kids [laughter] you know and we teach them not to lie 

294.70 295.87 B: no it isn't 

297.98 299.23 B: (( right )) 

299.42 300.28 B: [laughter] 

301.79 302.87 B: right 

302.29 315.18 A: so um but that's a and you know i know they 'cause one thing i always learned in school i had a professor who would say never say never [laughter] yeah [laughter] and yeah and i 

310.48 314.32 B: [noise] oh well that's true that's true 

314.35 318.90 B: but now if you on the other hand if you had to commit perjury 

318.68 319.56 A: (( mm )) 

319.55 320.60 B: (( you know )) 

320.90 323.31 B: that may come up 

323.49 325.41 B: as a different circumstance 

325.40 336.28 A: yeah yeah i mean and that's it i can't imagine all the hypotheticals that could come up and ah you know i i at this point i can't imagine 

336.30 343.04 A: ever committing perjury to to help to help to help anybody and ah but i'm not saying that 

337.80 338.96 B: (( [noise] right )) 

340.26 341.28 B: right 

343.23 356.48 A: ah something couldn't happen that i might think about it i don't think i'd do it but you know i i'm not so hundred percent sure that you wouldn't think about it in certain cases i mean you know you if you would say 

346.54 348.46 B: [laughter] 

352.37 353.38 B: right 

354.22 355.34 B: right 

356.44 360.46 A: boy it's really gonna be a travesty of justice if this person 

360.36 372.04 A: is convicted i think it's possible then you're gonna think about it and i mean i just don't i can't imagine doing it but i won't be so pious as to say i would never even think about it 

371.56 373.05 B: (( [cough] right )) 

372.54 374.55 A: so ah you know i wouldn't 

373.79 374.71 B: right 

374.66 377.85 A: but ah it would be a terrible situation to be in 

377.80 379.12 B: it would be you 

378.83 379.86 A: yeah 

379.13 380.30 B: (( know 'cause )) 

380.80 392.52 B: you know ah also um sometimes you can commit perjury without even knowing that you did it [noise] because sometimes if a person tells you [noise] like 

392.65 397.55 B: you know they committed something and then um 

398.04 404.56 B: well or they didn't commit something and well say they committed something and then they 

400.03 401.27 A: (( i yeah )) 

404.71 405.65 B: (( ah )) 

405.74 417.24 B: said that they didn't commit something and then you were under oath and you said hey ah you know this guy said he didn't do it it was just 

411.33 412.12 A: (( mm )) 

415.93 421.04 A: well but then see that that's that's honest though that that would be honest i i don't think that 

418.71 419.63 B: right 

420.02 423.92 B: but it would be kinda like honesty perjury [laughter] 

422.97 436.82 A: yeah [laughter] i don't think they could get you on that [laughter] 'cause that was to the best of your knowledge [laughter] i think you have to know that you're lying you know i i really i really think you've got to know 

424.24 424.86 B: (( mm )) 

426.21 428.08 B: uh-uh no i hope not 

429.03 430.64 B: [laughter] 

432.23 434.32 B: yeah yeah that's true 

436.83 443.91 A: so ah but ah no it's it's a tough one for me because i can't you know i really 

440.91 442.42 B: yeah me too 

443.94 454.36 A: can't think of a hypothe- i you know it i i'm thinking trying to think of a hypothetical where i would say gee maybe in that case i would do it but i can't come up with one 

454.35 457.89 B: [noise] [sigh] you know we could always think of um 

454.39 456.30 A: you know it's i just 

458.24 459.45 B: o._j. 

459.36 465.68 A: ah you know i've been thinking of him since we started this [laughter] and ah 

459.46 460.38 B: [laughter] 

462.63 464.23 B: (( [laughter] )) 

464.75 467.28 B: i mean he'd lie good 

466.79 471.02 A: yeah i know yeah he testified in his second trial the civil suit 

470.12 471.08 B: right 

470.90 483.43 A: and perjured himself from one end of the day to the other and of course he's off free well playing golf in florida [laughter] but supposedly he has to of course there's not jail for civil suits but he should of 

474.01 474.63 B: [laughter] 

476.07 478.16 B: i know but 

483.28 494.98 A: ah he's supposed to have paid the people lots of money which i guess he never did so ah but no i would find ah i can't think of a good hypothetical i mean and i suppose there are times when it would say 

487.13 488.18 B: mhm 

494.95 503.91 A: your child if you said your child and would you commit perjury and then you because they were going to go to the electric chair if you didn't 

503.92 505.57 B: well that's true 

504.07 504.77 A: see 

505.10 507.63 A: yeah i mean that could be a tough one 

507.50 508.64 B: yeah 

507.64 512.58 A: i mean specially if you thought your kid really was good and had repented and would never do it again 

512.48 526.53 B: you know i remember seeing a movie about this lady that did commit perjury sort of because she knew that her son had killed his girlfriend and she tried to hide it 

512.60 513.47 A: (( ah )) 

523.87 524.97 A: mhm

532.88 534.01 A: yeah 

533.16 537.62 B: 'cause she she knew but she didn't want to say anything 

535.88 539.18 A: mhm mhm yeah 

538.27 544.20 B: because she knew that they were having trouble and that was a t._v. movie that was with um 

542.69 543.70 A: yeah 

544.32 550.56 B: [lipsmack] gosh i can't think of her name now it's the one that lives that used to live in ah corpus christi

562.41 564.63 B: i really don't [laughter] 

563.64 572.88 A: [laughter] i like murder stories [laughter] yeah a good myst- as long as it's a good mystery i don't like violence i don't need to see the murder you know [laughter] but if 

565.79 566.58 B: (( you do ))

587.94 589.03 B: mhm 

590.17 595.50 A: but no a- as far as i can say right now i can't imagine a hypothetical case that would 

595.79 597.09 B: maybe 

595.83 599.60 A: get me to commit perjury but and i hope i never [laughter]
