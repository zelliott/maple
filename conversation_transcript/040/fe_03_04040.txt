0.54 1.55 A: hello 

0.74 2.00 B: hello 

2.09 3.13 A: uh hello 

3.15 6.91 B: hi i'm vince uh from california 

5.45 7.94 A: uh hey vince i'm jeff from california 

7.52 14.22 B: oh what part of california you from i'm from l._a. too actually near the area 

8.95 10.19 A: uh los angeles 

12.73 15.97 A: okay yeah i'm i'm not too far from you i'm in glendale [mn] 

15.76 16.94 B: oh okay 

17.28 21.12 B: um how would you feel with a million dollars and leaving the u._s. forever 

20.78 25.72 A: uh i'd leave tonight [laughter] yeah for a million bucks absolutely [laughter] 

22.23 24.22 B: oh really 

25.39 32.71 B: um i don't know if i could stay out forever if if i could return i would take it but you know there's there's so much opportunity here 

33.36 34.68 B: where would you go 

34.47 43.07 A: i was thinking about that um probably costa rica 'cause it has everything los angeles has but not nearly as many people [laughter] 

41.74 42.83 B: that's true 

42.98 50.78 A: but probably somewhere around there but i'd probably take about you know a couple of years to find like the ideal spot i mean a million dollars would last a while i would imagine 

50.79 54.60 B: that's true in in many developing countries that that is the case 

55.18 58.84 B: although i think that i'd keep my opportunities here 

59.16 65.72 B: it'd just be hard for me to leave a country you know i was born in and grew up in and all that sort of thing mhm 

63.55 66.68 A: mm oh sure i mean i'm sure you have family too 

66.49 71.08 B: and there's just a lot this is the land of opportunity too and of itself 

66.87 67.71 A: yeah 

71.29 81.61 A: yeah that's that's true it's uh it'd be difficult i mean i actually i i lived in europe for a while when i was younger and so i i had i was i was gone for seven years and i i missed the united states a lot [laughter] 

81.77 85.83 A: you know when when i was there so i can definitely appreciate it i would probably miss it more now 

81.82 82.88 B: uh-huh 

86.19 90.03 B: yeah i mean that is a large sum of money 

89.80 94.27 A: oh most definitely i mean that that would make that would make finding the place uh 

94.35 95.93 A: uh very enjoyable 

95.79 98.21 B: oh yes it'd make it much easier 

98.11 103.79 A: [noise] and also you could buy a laptop so you could still be in communication with everybody which would be pretty cool 

103.89 105.19 B: oh yeah 

106.93 107.80 A: i guess 

107.34 110.24 B: um you definitely got a phone too 

110.08 120.57 A: oh yeah yeah [noise] i mean it's it's a lot easier to do now than before you know like just sending email transactions and you know digital photos and stuff that'd be pretty cool 

120.20 124.16 B: oh there's nothing like being at home is there 

122.70 131.65 A: well yeah it depends yeah exactly you know home home is where you take it though [laughter] you know home could be easter island with a million bucks [laughter] 

130.78 132.44 B: that's true 

132.51 138.35 B: if you have a nice workstation and so forth like that could make it almost a virtual home 

136.71 148.93 A: yeah exactly exactly i mean as long as i can communicate and you know get get the uh get you know the information on what's going on you know in the united states while i'm not here i think i'd be all right for a little while anyway hm i 

146.45 151.58 B: mhm and i oh go ahead 

150.40 154.39 A: was just saying i guess the hypothetical is y- you have to leave and not come back though right 

154.20 156.52 B: yeah that's really tough 

154.70 157.24 A: [laughter] yeah that that would be tough 

157.14 163.91 B: you know like for two years or three years you know i could see it but just um there's so much liberty and so much to do here 

164.23 169.96 A: yeah it's and i think if you if you leave you you tend to miss it more because you really you recognize the difference 

168.37 173.72 B: mhm 

170.76 177.03 A: and i'm i'm sure i mean i'm sure i did you know when i was in europe and yes i'm sure if i left now i'd probably 

177.10 179.99 A: miss the united states you know pretty soon afterward 

179.55 181.09 B: what part of europe [mn] 

181.41 183.34 A: i used to live in belgium 

183.07 184.39 B: oh okay 

183.97 186.19 A: yeah so i was there for seven years 

186.48 189.72 B: so sort of the french sort of german sort of mix 

189.11 193.06 A: and uh yeah basically it's yeah exactly it's it's uh 

193.38 197.21 A: it's it's a federation now of of french speakers and flemish speakers so there is 

197.67 202.60 B: oh flemish that's right flemish which is a derivative of german right is that the 

197.68 198.64 A: yeah 

199.32 200.29 A: yeah 

201.14 203.74 A: well yeah it's very it's very similar to dutch 

203.47 206.29 B: term uh-huh it's a germanic language 

204.23 211.09 A: yeah exactly yeah and any other the the french people don't get along with the flemish people just like you know the 

211.28 215.67 A: you know ireland don't get along with the british and it's the same everywhere around there [laughter] 

215.55 220.89 B: uh-huh mm so it's like a south north sort of thing in their own country 

218.85 221.77 A: yeah it's always economic and it's economic there too 

221.85 225.63 B: and like what the germans probably have the upper hand or the germanic 

224.33 231.88 A: no i think the french do actually yeah the french traditionally have had all the you know manufacturing jobs and the good agricultural jobs 

225.99 227.70 B: oh really okay 

230.16 231.45 B: (( mm )) 

232.25 235.16 A: and the flemish had you know pretty much what's left 

234.97 239.97 B: so it's a political it's been a political sort of bias there 

238.48 248.17 A: yeah but but the thing is it works though because they they just have have a confederation so they have two separate state essentially and and they get along [laughter] you know which which is pretty weird too 

246.26 251.14 B: (( ah kind of a wild idea )) 

249.59 252.24 A: yeah i know it's amazing you know they actually do 

252.37 263.83 B: now costa rica is an interesting choice because i know it has a fairly stable government they call it the switzerland of latin america mhm 

259.82 270.76 A: yeah and it's supposed to be beautiful too i mean i've never been there but i've seen pictures it looks gorgeous and they got a they got a rain forest there and and ruins and and pretty good food i'm told 

267.13 269.02 B: yes 

270.48 282.76 B: i've i've i've also thought thought ballese would be an interesting choice because it's uh you have english speakers i mean i speak spanish but the english would help um you have the the galapagos which are close by i believe 

275.39 276.33 A: oh yeah 

277.47 278.96 A: oh definitely 

283.04 284.06 A: oh yeah 

283.09 285.61 B: so there there's a lot of beauty there too 

285.20 288.10 A: oh i yeah actually that's one place i really would like to go 

288.20 289.24 B: ballese 

288.88 290.52 A: no galapagos 

290.39 294.62 B: yeah the galapagos it's it's supposed to be something else 

291.43 292.23 A: yeah 

293.18 297.98 A: yeah yeah i think that'd be incredible you know it's so pristine if it if it is still pristine 

296.81 302.06 B: i think it's supposed to be pretty good 

299.43 304.53 A: yeah yeah i there was that um oil slick though remember like a couple of like a year ago 

304.52 306.16 B: yeah 

305.18 309.33 A: uh i couldn't believe that there was any there was an oil ship anywhere around there 

309.27 317.69 B: (( that's terrible mm what do ya think of this fisher study )) 

310.08 312.89 A: and and i didn't think it was like a you know where they went 

316.20 326.63 A: i think it's a pretty interesting idea i mean i i don't know obviously you know all the different things they're doing you know what they're what they're testing particularly but it's it's a neat it sounds like a pretty interesting project doesn't it 

321.27 322.42 B: uh-huh 

326.54 328.46 B: yeah how did you find out about 

328.23 330.37 A: ah l._a. weekly 

328.51 332.23 B: it oh really it was in the weekly 

331.56 333.75 A: it was in the weekly where where did you see it 

333.47 344.91 B: um i was just looking on the internet going on some like i think it was well volition dot com mentioned it and some other mystery shopping companies mentioned it you know it was like a discussion board [mn] oh go 

341.04 341.86 A: oh 

342.91 344.89 A: oh okay yeah i 

345.28 346.99 B: (( ahead )) 

346.00 351.01 A: i was just saying the lady when i talked to her i think she said there were like like several thousand participants 

351.18 363.33 B: yeah how many calls have you done yeah same here but you could do more though i think yeah it says that that if you say yes they may may pick you to do more 

351.77 353.35 A: it's a pretty big program 

354.61 356.38 A: uh this is my third 

358.44 359.44 A: (( oh can you )) 

363.62 365.67 A: how cool yeah 

364.82 367.36 B: 'cause i like it's easy money 

366.95 371.17 A: yeah i mean you know it's [laughter] sixty bucks an hour that's that's more than i make consulting 

371.05 376.35 B: that's what i'm saying you know sixty bucks an hour is higher than most people's billing rate so what the heck 

374.77 376.10 A: yeah no kidding 

376.13 383.05 A: no kidding yeah and that's i'm glad you told me that i didn't know that i thought that you know once you did your three you were done but yeah i would i'd love to do some more 

381.33 389.84 B: mhm i understand that that they're not the only university that's done this before that there's other universities that have done this 

388.30 393.78 A: oh really do do you know anything more about like what they were studying or like what they were trying to what what are they trying to accomplish 

393.75 398.04 B: i think they're trying to analyze how we conduct conversations and these are sort of uh 

398.20 400.01 B: icebreakers 

399.78 400.68 A: (( ah )) 

400.22 406.11 B: you know that's a good one a good topic like where would you what would you do with a million bucks or move or not i think that's a great topic 

405.81 409.91 A: well certainly yeah it's it's an easy one to to discuss 

410.08 418.29 B: i've i've had a couple of others one was the minimum wage and the other one was uh about the war in iraq and that's sort of past tense already 

416.83 420.61 A: well yeah you you have to be really topical or you miss out [laughter] 

419.75 423.19 B: yeah how 'bout you what did you have 

421.77 425.93 A: actually i did all mine tonight so i've i've had the same [laughter] i've had the same uh topic 

425.71 431.53 B: oh you just talk and what did the other people have to say about this 

428.91 438.32 A: uh well very much i mean in my small sample of three uh all all would have problems leaving you know and and all would miss the united states pretty quickly 

432.89 433.78 B: uh-huh 

438.11 440.54 B: oh it would be a it'd be a tough call 

440.06 445.96 A: yeah yeah exactly i mean and none of them said oh yeah you know where do i sign i'm leaving you know [laughter] 

444.87 448.07 B: (( mhm go ))

448.73 450.47 B: ahead 

449.24 456.34 A: saying i wouldn't have minded you know discussing you know some of the other ones that you had like the you know iraq war and the other ones 'cause 

454.58 458.69 B: mhm 

456.95 460.17 A: that's pretty interesting too but like you're right it was over too quick [laughter]

503.27 512.57 A: well it was just a little uh a little display ad a little ad and uh it said uh you'll get paid ten dollars each time you're on the phone and you could also earn a thousand dollars 

507.28 508.31 B: ah 

513.35 516.12 A: then it has just a little bit about you know the fisher project 

516.19 519.26 A: i mean just like a just like a paragraph i mean you know not that much 

516.32 518.41 B: oh good 

519.46 521.80 B: yeah 

520.58 531.65 A: but yeah i mean i i remember when i talked to the lady who was setting it up 'cause i i signed up over the phone and she was really friendly and and you know she talked to me like twenty minutes and you know kinda went over the program
