60.68 69.70 A: well you know this is the most interesting one yet because the last two were with guys and we agreed on the subject so it was hard to fill up the ten minutes because 

63.05 63.92 B: yes 

68.75 70.89 B: i know it was 

70.27 74.40 A: but this one's interesting 'cause it opens a i would like to go into something where

77.32 79.30 B: yeah that would be nice 

79.33 83.09 A: like i've been thinking about going into one of those um 

83.55 93.27 A: businesses where you could access a website that say the city owed them money like once a year the city puts out a [cough] 

90.19 91.20 B: mhm 

92.73 95.14 B: oh yes i know it mhm 

93.60 101.90 A: bulletin and i don't know that everybody sees it and wouldn't it be fun to call people up and maybe take like ten percent something real fair 

100.18 101.19 B: yeah 

101.40 102.56 B: mhm 

101.95 105.42 A: and take the bigger accounting call people up and say guess what 

104.97 106.21 B: yeah 

105.53 108.79 A: i know where you can pick up fifty thousand dollars right now 

108.42 116.38 B: yeah that would be that that would be interesting i mean there's so many different businesses that i wanna get into you know like 

116.31 127.58 B: i live in new york where i feel that insurance is the hardest to obtain and to keep [noise] hold on one second john don't do that the hardest to obtain and to keep here because 

127.41 131.05 B: the prices are just outrageous you know it's like 

130.86 143.57 B: you pay for insurance but they really don't want you to get into a car accident or anything like that [noise] so i i feel and like i've always felt like you know if i had the money i would definitely open an insurance company in new york 

134.26 135.62 A: [laughter] 

143.62 148.15 B: you know a place where people could get reasonable priced insurance 

147.55 148.97 A: is it possible 

148.87 154.46 B: um i don't it's it's it's really hard you know i don't how how har- 

153.72 156.72 A: are you talking about like health or car or 

156.01 160.68 B: car insurance like auto insurance home owner's insurance things like that 

159.62 163.06 A: i didn't know people in new york actually drove cars 

162.52 164.52 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

163.55 165.75 A: 'cause the few times i've been there 

165.99 169.09 A: i've just seen billions of cabs 

168.38 169.81 B: [laughter] 

169.38 171.89 A: really i i i don't think i ever saw 

170.43 171.55 B: well that's 

172.26 174.27 A: [mn] well i suppose i guess 

174.33 176.15 B: that's in the city 

174.38 176.76 A: over that hudson river bridge or 

176.34 179.71 B: that's mostly in the city that are all the um 

179.95 190.32 B: all the cab drivers but [mn] outside of the city i mean there is there are so many cars on the road and that's why traffic is horrendous here i mean it's nothing like l._a. 

190.31 195.96 B: where i know they have yeah but it's it is really here bad here traffic and 

190.56 192.86 A: [sigh] l._a.'s certainly treacherous 

196.38 208.32 B: you know it's hard for people to get cars you know i'm young i'm i'm only twenty five and everybody that i know either has their insurance in their mom's name or this one's name or that one's name because it is so expensive here 

208.97 210.19 A: jeez 

209.56 221.25 B: you know and then i also think um have thought about you know i have two children as well and i said you know if i had the money i would open up a children's only bank in new york because they have them 

220.15 223.17 A: a children's only bank what a good idea 

221.27 222.44 B: yes 

222.64 224.24 B: they have them though 

224.18 229.50 B: outside of new york i only know of one place that actually has it i think it's in iowa or something like that 

229.36 235.59 B: and you can you know i can open an accan- account for my kids and they can get a checking account and an a._t._m. card and all of that 

235.37 249.10 B: but you know they can't really we can't do deposits unless it's through the mail so i think if they had things like that in new york you know would just bring up a child's morale it would teach them so much more and you know so there's so many ideas i have on 

248.90 253.65 B: you know businesses that i would open up and everytime i have an experience you know i go 

248.96 249.84 A: uh-huh 

253.72 260.93 B: if i had the money i'm going to open up a place like this you know and i'm gonna open up something like that 'cause things are so difficult sometimes out here 

261.39 264.60 A: well it's a it's a jam packed state isn't it 

263.98 265.55 B: it is 

265.80 267.29 A: i mean boy 

267.39 268.98 A: it's like [mn] 

269.25 271.84 A: when i was there so many years ago 

271.87 279.07 A: i was uh closer to your age i'm fifty three now and um there were eight million people in the city then 

274.69 275.65 B: mhm 

279.09 280.95 B: yeah 

280.67 282.34 A: you know um 

282.86 288.03 A: which our er las vegas has just now gotten to um 

288.10 294.30 A: [lipsmack] a million point three which is one of the reasons why i moved it was just ridiculous 

294.25 295.40 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

294.79 297.55 A: everything is is impossible there now 

297.80 301.12 A: because it's still the little valley it always was [noise] 

299.55 301.76 B: yeah yeah 

302.67 313.61 B: [noise] but it's also because they've made it so um easy for people to buy homes to get cars 'cause we okay when we started going to vegas when i turned twenty one a couple of years ago 

302.76 303.95 A: you know [noise] 

313.92 321.50 B: when we left there my husband was like well maybe we should move here you know let's just fax out some resumes 

321.49 332.86 B: because we had spoken to people out there who had told us that you know they had got gotten hired over the phone for forty and fifty thousand dollar jobs because you know they really needed people out there to work 

332.97 334.23 A: that's true 

333.23 334.04 B: and 

334.11 346.49 B: and how the unemployment rate was so low this one woman told us that she was in her car for about two months before she even had a company to finance her they told her you know just take the car we will find you a bank 

346.44 352.40 B: you know it she was having her house built from the ground up the way she wanted it 

351.44 353.53 A: everything's real real new here 

353.21 355.78 B: for for a couple grand you know 

355.83 361.38 B: down where in new york you need at least twenty thirty grand to get into any home 

360.73 362.10 A: jeez 

361.60 367.52 B: you know and out there you know you could get an apartment for six hundred bucks with two bedrooms and 

367.55 372.45 B: you know i have an apartment with three bedrooms and we're paying like sixteen hundred bucks 

372.85 374.07 A: (( wow )) 

373.38 382.05 B: so you know like we left there like wow you know maybe we should move there and then there was the whole you know i love to gamble so maybe we shouldn't 

381.54 382.73 A: [laughter] 

382.15 395.78 B: but you know it really crossed our mind and every time we go or every time you know something comes up we're like you know maybe we should just fax it out there maybe we should just see how things go you know go out there for a couple of years and then come back or something [noise] 

392.99 393.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

396.29 398.80 A: [noise] well you know you really would like it 

398.16 399.87 B: oh i love it i know

400.23 401.30 B: i love it 

402.65 404.05 B: mhm 

404.00 404.91 A: um 

405.56 410.26 A: [sigh] y- you know i guess because seeing as there are so many zillions of people there 

410.56 418.65 A: you the and the competition i mean everybody there is educated and and aggressive and [noise] uh you know 

414.85 415.77 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

418.84 420.76 A: ambitious out here it's

452.21 453.42 B: yeah 

453.44 454.35 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

453.70 459.90 A: so actually though i never [noise] [mn] real- really i never sold sex 

459.49 460.43 B: mhm

485.80 486.95 B: mhm 

486.50 487.65 A: (( and )) 

488.49 494.45 A: they didn't care if they talked about sex or not at all and i realised that they were calling for 

491.29 492.36 B: mhm 

494.49 497.69 A: reasons i never anticipated and 

496.53 497.50 B: mhm 

497.73 501.37 A: so my ex husband came over one day and he said what are you doing in bed 

501.38 505.21 A: at two o'clock in the afternoon and i said i'm just so tired because 

503.06 503.97 B: mhm
