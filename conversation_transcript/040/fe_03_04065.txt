1.71 2.85 B: hello 

1.80 2.95 A: hello 

3.13 4.72 B: hi my name is mary beth 

4.79 6.70 A: hello mary beth i'm jeff 

6.51 10.85 B: hi nice to meet you so what kind of business would you open 

7.83 9.09 A: nice to meet you 

12.33 14.60 A: well considering if 

14.64 19.18 A: if i could open my own business and earn enough money to 

19.64 28.23 A: take care of my needs i would open some and this sounds very escapist but a nice little tiki bar on a beach somewhere 

28.69 29.85 B: (( mm )) 

29.41 37.79 A: it's all cash it's a great environment and even though you work a lot in that industry 

38.29 48.04 A: ya ya can't beat being on the beach to have the business you own i currently own a business which is probably the reason i would um consider that 

47.61 49.20 B: ah 

48.97 50.48 A: what would you open 

50.23 55.32 B: [lipsmack] um i think i would like to have some sort of 

55.61 63.33 B: um travel or tour guide business um but i'd really what i'd really like to do is 

63.73 71.98 B: uh participate in some sort of non profit foundation that would fund trips for under privileged kids maybe 

71.29 72.16 A: sure 

72.05 79.11 B: um although i don't know if that's considered a successful business [laughter] because it would be non profit um 

79.47 85.95 B: but uh i mean it sounds like you have an appreciation for travel too because you appreciate the beach so 

85.58 86.43 A: oh 

85.98 87.01 B: um 

87.04 87.96 A: yes 

87.61 88.29 B: i 

88.72 90.64 B: i think that could really 

91.30 99.50 B: i don't know i think it could make a difference in the lives of a lot of people i mean i think that probably our whole country would be better off if we traveled more and saw other cultures 

99.60 100.78 A: well i agree 

99.79 103.00 B: or had more exposure to other other cultures 

102.36 104.52 A: i agree wholeheartedly um 

104.84 112.54 A: when i was a kid i had the opportunity in one year to go to the soviet union communist china and south asia in 

112.30 113.85 B: (( wow oh )) 

114.08 120.70 A: all all in the space of one year and i've never looked at the world the same since 

116.55 118.09 B: my goodness 

120.29 122.01 B: oh wow 

120.81 122.06 A: i now 

122.11 128.61 A: you know i ended up getting a minor in russian studies intended to go to work for the c._i._a. 

128.88 142.60 A: did not and and now ironically unwinding the business i own a piece of that is an investment bank but i look at the world on a global perspective and kids don't do that now 

142.23 143.68 B: yeah 

142.60 145.44 A: they don't they don't see beyond m._t._v. 

145.02 146.64 B: yeah 

148.32 149.90 A: what um 

150.93 162.99 A: i guess back in the vein of the call what would define success for you in opening a business i mean do you just wanna earn enough to live do you wanna get phenomenally wealthy is it 

162.94 167.67 A: one of the kids that went on one of these trips became president 

167.12 172.08 B: [laughter] um gosh i haven't thought that far ahead i mean at at least for my- 

172.29 178.96 B: for myself i mean i would consider it successful if i kept wanting to do it um i don't 

177.56 178.31 A: sure 

179.85 190.67 B: i don't anticipate that i'll ever be rich [laughter] regardless of what i do um so you know i don't really see that as a possibility or the kind of goal that i wanna work toward anyway 

184.29 184.85 A: (( [mn] )) 

190.42 191.29 A: okay 

190.62 195.39 B: um so yeah i think i think it were something that i've i've 

195.73 198.69 B: got rewards from and um 

199.84 205.70 B: felt satisfied with enough to keep doing it that's what i would consider successful and 

205.78 210.45 B: [sigh] you know what the criteria are [laughter] i'm not really sure because this is 

209.59 210.60 A: oh sure 

210.51 214.93 B: a fantasy that i came up with in the last few minutes [laughter] um 

217.68 218.96 B: what about you 

219.50 228.66 A: [lipsmack] it would be considering i'm unwinding a business now simply because i hate to go to work on monday morning anymore 

229.17 229.93 A: i mean 

229.99 235.57 A: i woke up yesterday sunday morning six twenty my first thought was oh hell 

235.74 238.72 A: it's sunday the weekend's half over 

238.70 240.27 B: (( [mn] )) 

240.31 248.29 A: so for me yeah that's why i want that escape kind of thing with something like a tiki bar on the beach 

246.81 249.54 B: (( [lipsmack] ooh [noise] mhm mhm )) 

248.37 254.31 A: i would enjoy it it's social i earn enough to pay room and board 

254.42 261.05 A: that's that's what it would take for me just that ability and willingness to keep doing it [mn] 

262.55 264.36 B: and where would you be willing to go 

265.22 274.76 B: for your business i mean you said on the beach but would you be be willing to go say to the beach on bulgaria or would it would you want it to be a certain area 

271.72 272.71 A: well 

274.11 284.25 A: well preferably the united states preferably the east coast of florida or the um north carolina [lipsmack] it's 

285.43 293.70 A: it's funny you mentioned somewhere like bulgaria because i would go somewhere like romania or bulgaria but i have a russian minor 

294.03 295.19 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

294.32 300.21 A: and it's probably not necessarily where you find a lot of tiki bars so i'd probably do very well there 

300.09 304.22 B: [laughter] that's true [sigh] 

304.00 309.14 A: [lipsmack] and yeah but i do have that certain element of ambition that 

309.50 310.51 A: you know 

310.72 313.97 A: would eventually kick in that i want to 

314.01 316.64 A: end up being the best in the business 

317.91 325.88 B: and do you feel like this is something that you you would realistically pursue now at this stage in your life i mean you said you're sorta making changes right now 

325.93 327.08 B: in your business 

325.97 337.37 A: well actually uh at at this stage in my life i probably would um [lipsmack] i am looking at a very different opportunity so i wouldn't consider it right now 

334.40 334.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

338.10 341.05 B: so this would be maybe something a winding down 

341.43 349.54 A: you know ironically t- the opportunity i'm looking at is only about an eighteen month opportunity and after that i would consider it 

341.73 343.27 B: sorta job later on 

349.30 350.97 B: (( [lipsmack] ah )) 

351.14 353.10 B: so you would have time to plan it anyway 

353.42 361.81 A: oh yeah i mean and i could conceivably see if i out this um engagement for the next eighteen months 

353.94 355.29 B: i mean in eighteen months 

362.23 364.41 A: i might do that after the fact 

365.86 372.03 B: wow and so do you have a family that you would take with you or is it just you you don't have any responsibilities 

369.25 369.95 A: (( no )) 

370.26 372.59 A: it's just it's just me 

372.33 372.89 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

373.73 374.84 B: wow 

374.91 388.08 A: and that does make it a lot easier it's not like i'm uprooting a wife or children or anything like that i mean i have a few relatives but no close immediate family so 

377.69 379.33 B: yeah 

381.12 382.36 B: right 

382.64 383.72 B: right 

387.43 388.26 B: right 

388.26 392.63 A: that gives me a certain element of flexibility now the ironic thing is 

392.90 395.51 A: leaving the friends that i have 

396.80 397.94 A: (( you know it's )) 

396.90 399.16 B: i don't see that as ironic at all 

400.15 400.72 A: (( [mn] )) 

400.97 410.32 A: yeah oh you're exactly right it is not ironic but that would be the toughest thing leaving the close friends to do something like this 

409.74 413.18 B: right right like having a having a permanent social connection 

413.01 413.79 A: sure 

413.71 416.27 B: sort of yeah that makes sense [lipsmack] 

417.46 425.70 A: [mn] what would it take for you to start either a travel oriented business or a travel oriented business that 

426.24 428.73 A: takes on privileged kids somewhere 

428.59 430.67 B: um probably a 

430.83 434.84 B: a huge source of funding [laughter] um 

433.70 436.75 A: oh gosh that sounds different [laughter] 

435.70 438.00 B: [laughter] 

437.04 441.36 A: i'm an investment b- or i am soon to be a former investment banker so 

440.35 441.89 B: oh wow 

442.17 443.37 B: um 

443.33 455.66 B: uh i think that's what it would take for this at this point i'm i'm finishing up graduate school i'm trying to decide what what realistically i want to do next and well my degree's in english so 

451.61 453.37 A: what kinda degree are ya getting 

454.80 455.91 A: (( oh okay )) 

455.54 463.12 B: so if you just you know if i just looked for a job in my degree i'd be pretty limited so i'm you know kinda trying to think outside the box 

460.45 461.17 A: sure 

463.29 464.24 B: um 

464.38 471.27 B: and that's something that i'm you know i'm i'm interested in travel and have benefited from it myself and [sigh] um 

471.29 476.63 B: you know i think it's something that i would i would care enough about that i would be willing to invest the time and energy 

476.91 482.11 B: to do it um but i mean obviously i've been i've been in school for 

482.12 487.03 B: my whole life basically [laughter] and don't have funding myself but i guess it would just be a matter of 

487.66 493.34 B: you know if i wanted to take the initiative now to write grants or you know to apply to some 

493.67 496.80 B: i don't know something like a gates foundation or something like that 

496.81 497.81 B: um 

497.98 500.37 B: to see if there's anyone whose interested in 

500.74 503.12 B: sponsoring it um 

503.51 504.93 B: but i'm also 

506.24 512.14 B: in the middle of starting a family right now [laughter] so um so so i don't know if 

508.64 509.81 A: oh my 

512.22 518.71 B: you know if if realistically that's something that i could do because i think it would take an an awful lot of energy 

519.56 523.51 B: to get going and it would take a big time commitment um 

524.01 529.55 A: you know you could probably look at some type of home based travel agency sorta thing 

529.49 530.81 B: (( mm )) 

531.32 536.30 A: i mean that would probably at least get your foot in the door 

535.94 537.07 B: right 

537.27 540.57 A: it accommodates you starting a family and then 

540.83 544.39 A: once as you build up the industry contacts you could 

544.63 550.61 A: then begin to develop some type of sponsorship program for kids to go somewhere 

550.26 552.20 B: yeah i mean that's 

553.05 562.92 B: it's it's something that i've thought about kind of on and off just you know not ever really seriously developing a business plan or anything but just kinda thinking that that might be interesting and 

563.00 564.23 B: and rewarding 

564.35 565.34 B: um 

565.53 576.16 B: but that i mean that's definitely a possibility because i am definitely um i am at the stage where i'm just in the decision making process i i don't have any commitments right now to a particular job 

576.52 577.47 A: (( well sure )) 

576.84 577.49 B: um 

577.51 578.44 B: so 

579.17 587.51 B: yeah so i don't know i mean i don't know what i i think with the economy what it is right now [noise] there probably wouldn't be the interest now that there might be a better time but 

586.77 587.71 A: oh no 

588.37 595.84 A: this is and that's the other hesitation i would have about a tiki bar or something like that it's a lousy economy to start anything 

595.79 596.84 B: yeah 

596.96 597.70 A: so 

597.87 599.89 A: well according to my time we have
