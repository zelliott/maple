38.25 40.00 B: (( yeah who ))

48.01 54.74 B: to lie for someone else i mean if they [noise] if they messed up and they required that no i don't think i would 

54.27 55.71 A: exactly they 

55.74 64.60 A: say it was um a best friend they knew what they were doing was wrong and somehow they caused injury to someone else whether it be financial or

62.64 63.87 B: right 

64.84 67.82 A: loss of life or anything they knew it was wrong and

71.47 73.78 B: [noise] 

72.54 73.57 A: for that

98.40 99.39 A: mhm 

101.51 104.69 B: i don't know i i don't even think for a family member 

104.88 109.47 A: and it really is hard too because it seems like no matter what you can get caught 

108.94 110.03 B: right 

111.92 118.09 A: and i don't know there are circumstances where i think lying is somewhat forgivable i mean if you're 

118.13 122.18 A: [noise] doing it um to spare someone's feelings but 

122.66 125.05 A: in court that's completely different 

124.54 125.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

126.79 127.59 B: [noise] 

127.87 129.80 B: [noise] right [noise] um

135.27 136.10 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

136.97 148.15 B: and they've been in situations where y- i i imagine i could have lied to bail them out [noise] and you know given them an alibi or something like that [noise] and no i mean 

148.38 151.15 B: they messed up [laughter] 

150.47 153.16 A: (( well and it's a learning experience for too )) 

152.48 154.77 B: [noise] right 

154.16 161.27 A: you know maybe if they do get caught and they have to pay the penalty maybe they won't commit crimes or whatever again 

159.93 160.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

161.02 172.41 B: [noise] nope they continued to but you know that was just their lifestyle but you know if if i would have that first time given them an alibi the first time i was able to you 

164.23 165.53 A: oh no 

172.66 177.61 B: know that would have put me in the same boat with them [noise] and they would have still continued to get in trouble 

177.64 178.91 B: (( so [noise] )) 

177.64 179.84 A: but but th- yeah that's a really good point you 

180.55 183.17 A: would be sinking kind of to a level that's not 

181.62 182.45 B: [noise] 

183.67 184.59 A: you 

184.04 186.41 B: (( [noise] right right ))

196.10 197.49 A: (( yeah )) 

201.96 208.42 B: i'm sorry that has nothing to do with the topic [laughter] [noise] he still has to get out of the cabinet 

204.44 205.95 A: [laughter] 

208.37 209.69 A: (( oh )) 

209.27 211.20 B: [laughter] 

210.35 213.02 A: (( [laughter] um what about )) 

213.26 225.00 A: what if okay this is kind of an off the wall thing but what if someone um i don't know committed murder because ah okay let's say it was a woman and her husband beat her right 

225.02 225.96 B: okay 

225.40 229.92 A: um and she killed him kind of in self defense 

230.41 232.88 A: would you be willing to lie for that 

232.33 236.75 B: no because she would get off for that if she killed him in self defense 

234.82 235.80 A: okay 

237.49 238.37 B: (( no )) 

239.40 247.67 A: that's just kind of a i don't know i can't think of anything else to say on this topic [laughter] we're both pretty much in agree in agreement it's it's not right 

245.33 249.57 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah well i mean the flip side of the coin let's see if 

251.36 256.04 B: if you did lie and you weren't caught would your conscience bother you 

256.48 258.37 A: i would feel so guilty 

258.92 262.57 A: i can't even take a newspaper without feeling bad 

261.94 264.31 B: i know i and the 

263.43 266.26 A: [laughter] much worse lying in front of a judge 

265.81 266.79 B: (( right )) 

266.71 268.90 A: after swearing on a bible 

268.54 269.26 B: (( right )) 

270.42 271.32 B: (( and ah )) 

271.57 276.17 B: i don't know i would probably think what kind of example am i setting for my children 

275.76 278.28 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah absolutely )) 

277.46 282.32 B: especially if someone else knew i mean they'd be looking at me going you're lying 

282.05 284.03 A: [noise] mhm [noise] 

282.86 288.90 B: especially if they were in the court room or there with me when this was going on and yeah i mean 

286.87 288.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

289.51 290.62 B: (( i don't know )) 

290.80 292.55 B: i would probably feel like um

294.10 294.68 A: (( [noise] )) 

296.34 298.10 A: (( yes yes )) 

297.32 300.55 B: [laughter] yeah it would just haunt me [laughter] 

299.85 306.19 A: oh definitely and it it would come out eventually and i don't know about you but i'm not a good liar [laughter] i 

306.21 307.23 B: (( no [laughter] )) 

306.63 313.49 A: mean i i said to my eyes maybe shift a little bit and i look down at my feet i it's very hard to do 

314.56 318.70 A: (( [noise] and i'd get caught maybe like are you lying and i'd say yes [laughter] )) 

317.34 319.09 B: [noise] [laughter]

383.35 385.93 A: huh well that's interesting 

386.00 387.94 A: yeah i haven't talked to any guys yet i 

387.18 388.56 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

388.23 389.09 A: (( don't know )) 

389.79 392.25 A: [noise] um let's see more on perjury 

392.44 397.29 B: [noise] is there any other sort of perjury besides in the courtroom 

397.91 403.08 A: i think it's only a [laughter] i'm not too good with political science but um 

403.44 408.30 B: is it i mean there's legal documents too ah or is that considered fraud 

403.72 404.58 A: i 

409.52 412.59 A: oh that might be perjury too you're right maybe it is 

413.51 419.79 A: like if you lie on um i don't know a department of transportation i suppose anything 

419.91 423.53 A: governmental that you would be lying on that might be considered perjury 

424.02 427.48 B: now i know notaries aren't supposed to notarize their own documents 

427.81 431.66 B: um is that considered perj- perjury or do you know 'cause um 

432.83 433.63 B: (( ah )) 

433.01 435.23 A: (( they notarize their own documents )) 

434.64 436.72 B: they're not supposed to 

436.63 440.40 A: right you're supposed to be a notary of the public or whatever 

437.30 438.53 B: and yet 

439.83 444.32 B: yeah and [noise] i well an old friend of mine a long time ago 

444.40 447.14 B: she used to notarize her own documents 

447.52 448.26 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

447.85 449.58 B: is that considered perjury 

449.93 451.00 B: or fraud 

451.50 452.42 A: (( i wonder )) 

452.44 454.39 A: that may be considered perjury 

455.30 459.86 A: 'cause maybe i'm thinking maybe perjury is um a greater offence 

460.74 464.56 A: maybe lying with anything that has to do with the government and that would be considered 

464.58 466.07 A: i suppose i don't know 

466.17 469.61 B: so if you knew someone perjured themselves would you tell 

471.27 473.16 A: oh that's a tough one 

474.98 480.58 A: and that comes to the whole ah would you betray your friends would you go out of your way 

477.89 479.47 B: (( right )) 

481.31 482.87 A: to betray your friends 

484.14 486.40 A: especially for a minor offence 

488.61 491.07 A: i don't know that's a hard one what about you 

488.71 489.51 B: yeah like 

493.55 495.92 B: i don't know i probably wouldn't tell 

496.30 501.44 B: i would probably hope that their conscience would get the best of them and they would tell on themselves 

501.48 508.24 A: mhm see they just if you're already involved in the situation like when you're um subpoenaed to go to court 

508.64 512.55 A: then you're already involved and you know you might as well tell 

512.71 515.14 B: right i mean if they ask you 

512.81 515.96 A: all that you know but if you're not involved 

517.66 521.32 A: then you would have to step up and actually [noise] say something [noise] that's a hard one 

522.28 523.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

524.25 525.13 A: [noise] 

524.49 530.22 B: i know i would hope that i would never be involved in a situation like that where i would have to like 

528.53 530.26 A: oh absolutely [noise] 

530.32 531.15 B: (( you know )) 

531.44 532.81 B: testify against 

533.26 535.67 B: friends family 

535.09 537.70 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

537.17 540.10 B: distant relative [laughter] 

539.13 542.93 A: right i was watching i don't know if you ever watch dateline or 

542.95 549.60 A: nightline any of those shows but i was watching one last night where a guy actually turned in his best friend who was an arsonist 

550.37 554.68 A: and he went through all this trouble to try and get him to um 

554.70 560.72 A: admit [noise] to his crime and then he had police right there and he arrested him immediately but 

561.78 564.23 A: even that i would feel kind of guilty [sigh] 

564.28 571.11 B: well yeah your best friend but you you know if it's your best friend wouldn't you think it would kind of be a betrayal 

571.83 579.66 A: [noise] oh yeah because you would feel like you actually knew that person and then that person [noise] you trusted them and you wouldn't think that they would do something [noise] that bad 

579.28 580.75 B: right so then 

581.03 583.54 B: to me they wouldn't be your best friend anymore 

583.31 587.73 A: [noise] mhm they'd kind of lose that status [noise] [noise] 

587.08 594.96 B: even granted i believe in unconditional love and um i i certainly love my best friend unconditionally but 

595.83 598.73 B: i don't know i- if if you do something like that 

597.52 599.89 A: [noise] to that extent right if they if they
