12.05 14.21 B: interesting ah topic huh [noise] 

13.71 16.90 A: yeah i know i've often wondered if i would 

16.91 20.12 A: you know stick up for a family member 

19.68 20.89 B: mhm 

20.28 22.15 A: isn't that kind of the question 

22.05 26.54 B: right yeah would you commit perjury for a f- a i think they said a family member 

26.19 27.34 A: yeah 

26.57 28.72 B: a close f- a close friend or family member 

28.52 31.37 A: right i kno- i know that is a tough one isn't it 

30.71 35.53 B: shall i shall say ladies first 'cause ah [laughter] this is a to- a tough topic [laughter] 

33.20 34.36 A: oh okay 

35.31 36.46 A: well i 

37.28 43.16 A: i think that i don't it's hard to say 'cause i'm really a a pretty good person i'm very honest 

42.45 43.73 B: right 

43.29 45.63 A: and i i try to do the right thing 

45.23 46.71 B: mhm 

46.24 47.50 A: but um 

47.75 55.90 A: i don't know it's just it's hard to say i don't know i might i might i don't know [laughter] it depends on how bad it is i guess 

50.74 51.62 B: (( would you )) 

53.01 54.55 B: do y- do you think 

54.93 64.06 B: right yeah i just was gonna say do you think that it would a situation [noise] of perhaps what the wh- the extent of the consequences might be whether you would do it or not [noise] 

64.64 73.62 A: yeah that's probably it if it was if it's something really if it was a really bad thing i would i just i couldn't live with that person like if it was a murder or [mn] 

71.12 72.19 B: mhm 

73.82 75.56 B: right right right [noise] 

74.21 75.72 A: ah maybe even 

76.50 88.77 B: i i i think i mean it's it's for me you know while the the challenge would be there to do the right thing [noise] it's it's it's cut and dry for myself i b- i i believe i like to think in those circumstances because 

76.61 77.55 A: i don't know 

88.60 93.97 B: it's as you said it is a matter of honesty and if i intend to be honest and do the right thing 

94.07 102.83 B: [sigh] sometimes doing the right thing isn't always the the the most expedient or the most liked thing yeah 

100.77 104.49 A: mm 'cause you you kinda have your family at stake too 

104.07 105.61 B: right right 

105.00 109.30 A: um you know you think okay i could be putting my husband in prison 

108.92 110.00 B: mhm 

109.37 113.61 A: for life what that's gonna really mess up my our life here 

112.82 113.84 B: yes 

114.39 116.21 B: yes i- 

114.78 117.87 A: oh boy that's that is it's really hard isn't it mhm 

117.04 129.03 B: it's it's it's it's hard but i guess you know i i [noise] i believe in in trying to follow bible principles [noise] ah on a daily basis and that you know the you run across bridges like that 

129.09 137.56 B: ah where again the the right thing to do is not the easy thing to do or the most well accepted thing to do 

137.97 141.65 A: so it's kinda like it goes back to what would jesus do in this situation 

141.03 143.59 B: exactly you know and 

142.10 144.54 A: ahah that's kind of a neat way to look at it 

143.98 147.14 B: yeah yeah and i- if you do it that way because it's real easy right 

147.19 154.11 B: you know y- y- y- i- if you or if you chose to imitate that you know i mean we all know what he would do and it's not i- it's not a matter of of 

154.14 169.08 B: of loyalty a- or s- or i guess it is a matter of loyalty but it's a matter of who you're gonna be loyal to whether it's to the family member or to christ or to god or to [sigh] or to th- th- the legal system you know which which asks you to be honest too because if we do it 

160.72 161.96 A: right 

169.09 171.91 B: if we condone it then we we really have to condone 

172.20 176.86 B: the the n- the next door neighbor who may have you know perhaps b- done some you know 

177.07 179.74 B: you know done something wrong and somebody covered up for him 

179.46 180.71 A: right 

180.41 187.63 B: you know we can't we w- and and and then you know bec- because once you open a can of those kind of things is [mn] what they say is the the horse is out the gate 

187.55 190.59 B: on on that then everybody gets to say well you did it 

190.36 205.20 B: you know and suppose the next door neighbor was [noise] you know perhaps a an a a you know a sex offender or [noise] something that you know threatens not just one person but a a community of people would we want somebody to to lie for him or her 

190.62 191.87 A: right right 

204.75 205.85 A: (( mm uh-huh )) 

206.37 207.17 A: (( yeah ah )) 

207.56 210.31 B: [noise] and quite a what they say quite a pickle right 

209.67 215.16 A: right i suppose i think it just goes back to the degree of the of the wrongdoing and 

210.34 211.69 B: [laughter] but 

214.51 216.15 B: (( yeah )) 

215.20 222.93 A: and i think that like you know i think we both agree that if it's something really serious well what would you do if it wasn't as serious 

223.00 223.98 A: i mean 

225.08 232.29 A: ah what would be a l- what would be a lesser ex- maybe to you found that someone in your family stole something out of the store 

225.28 226.86 B: i think i think i think 

227.23 228.19 B: (( hm )) 

232.09 233.09 B: mhm 

232.35 233.87 A: would that be a lesser 

234.20 236.92 A: or would it be have to be a little greater than that [mn] 

236.33 243.85 B: well it would be i- i think in all [noise] for myself i think it it it it all is on the same playing field if a person 

244.27 251.38 B: is is [noise] guilty of something [noise] that i've come to know about i really do have a community responsibility 

250.75 252.66 A: okay yeah 

251.62 263.00 B: you know and a and a individual responsibility to to be honest because it's it it comes back in a sense that if i condone i i can't if i condone it for myself i'd i really do 

263.51 268.63 B: without ah you know if i if i'm not wanting to be a hypocrite have to condone it for others and the other people may may you know 

266.53 268.43 A: i see what yeah 

268.55 269.74 A: right 

269.41 273.41 B: the person who like for example where i i used to work they had drug tests 

273.41 276.38 B: and people would do all sorts of ah [noise] you know 

276.38 291.23 B: trickery things to to get around that ah you know swapping bottles of this and you know all kind of stuff and and they know about it so if i'm if i'm gonna lie for one person then i should be [noise] ah willing to say it's okay for the person who's driving my kid on the school bus 

281.20 282.21 A: uh-huh 

291.32 303.02 B: to do it because somebody lied for him you know i- i- it becomes bigger and bigger issues and i think i think that is ah the the one of the moral problems that that society has is that 

293.86 294.84 A: uh-huh 

296.70 297.99 A: (( right )) 

303.39 304.40 B: ah 

304.44 308.12 B: you know i as an individual may minimize what i think is 

308.59 313.65 B: you know so this wasn't so bad i'm only it's my son it's my brother it's my whatever 

311.83 315.58 A: right you just you justify it you can't justify it 

313.73 317.49 B: right but but but want to throw the first stone [laughter] 

316.56 318.58 A: right i see yeah yeah 

317.60 319.04 B: at the next person 

318.92 331.66 A: i was kinda brought up wi- [noise] my mom and dad would well my mom would say if you get in trouble at school you're gonna get in worse trouble when you get home and i think that's a good thing to you know we kinda raised our kids that way too you know i'm not gonna well first you're gonna find out what happened 

324.77 325.98 B: yep 

328.60 329.98 B: exactly 

331.09 332.46 B: mhm 

332.29 335.33 A: and i'm like i said i'm honest so i'm gonna i'm gonna be 

335.34 338.07 A: i'm gonna [noise] look at both issues you know what i mean 

337.69 339.49 B: right 

339.59 340.84 A: (( [mn] so )) 

339.74 345.40 B: you know but but i guess when it comes down to to brass t- you know [mn] i guess then then really what it is is then [noise] 

345.72 347.81 B: when it really happens 

347.90 359.07 B: [noise] where do we stand you know if if if the actual incident were to happen that a f- close fa- fam family member or friend or relative co worker w- is in a situation where [noise] 

359.00 365.75 B: you know we know about what they've done or where they've confessed something that they've done but we would we would would we really stand there 

364.73 366.05 A: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

365.85 377.62 B: you know and and take the heat or or and or um and believe in what we're talking about [laughter] will we remember this conversation even [laughter] i remember i talked to ah a woman from idaho [noise] you know [laughter] and we both said it you know 

372.05 373.17 A: right 

374.42 375.65 A: [laughter] 

377.37 380.28 A: yeah i think we both pretty much agree on the same thing 

380.09 381.90 B: mhm 

380.79 385.86 A: it sounds like you've kind of you've g- did you say went to did some bible studies or something or went to the bible studies 

385.66 389.20 B: yeah yeah i i'm a i'm a bible myself i'm one of jehovah's witnesses 

387.99 388.68 A: uh-huh 

389.40 392.54 A: that helps too to have good you know moral um 

391.56 392.34 B: yes 

392.97 395.69 A: and ah being a christian helps i think too 

394.58 401.32 B: right it does ah d- do you ah study the bible is that where your your center is coming from here as well 

399.64 413.33 A: yeah you just kinda go by what the bible says you know what would you know what would jesus do about the situation and sometimes that can make it [mn] it's easier to answer something when you can go back and say well what would jesus do about that you know 

402.18 403.57 B: (( mhm now )) 

405.93 406.75 B: right 

413.11 414.40 B: that's exactly 

413.36 420.91 A: well jesus never sinned so you know [laughter] of course we're not jesus we do sin so that's probably why it would be harder for us 

420.31 424.44 B: yeah we have a we have a we have a tough road to follow but it can be followed 

423.93 425.12 A: yeah 

424.53 430.62 B: um now are in idaho is is are you in a small community or a larger city or 

429.62 435.37 A: ah we we're in a small smaller community but we're really close to the capital boise 

435.01 435.89 B: okay 

435.48 437.79 A: so we're about forty miles from boise 

437.30 438.25 B: okay 

437.90 438.82 A: our 

438.83 440.81 A: [mn] i said capital of idaho i mean 

440.52 445.93 B: right right and i'm in ah philadelphia which is the biggest city here in pennsylvania yeah 

441.11 442.24 A: yeah 

444.31 447.21 A: oh yeah and you're right in the city right yeah 

446.47 456.69 B: right right so [noise] it's interesting that even even though we're i guess ah diverse in in terms of you know our backgrounds because i know smaller communities probably have ah i guess in my opinion would seem to have 

456.90 461.68 B: to be to be closer knit and and be a more value oriented whe- whereas the city 

461.37 462.44 A: (( uh-huh different )) 

461.84 467.52 B: you know sometimes can be ah you know well i tell ya i if i could just speak for [noise] my neighbors it seems like [mn] 

467.54 481.72 B: you know ah most peo- i would be i would be on the the [noise] ah wrong side of of the argument if if we were to ask most of my neighbors and you know so it's interesting to see that at least you know there's some commonalities despite the fact that ah you know we we're we're in 

481.53 482.77 B: (( different ah )) 

482.85 484.56 B: you know demograph 

483.88 485.75 A: uh-huh yeah 

486.31 489.18 A: well it sounds like we've got that common ground you know 

488.18 489.60 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

489.43 492.04 A: ah knowing the lord you know so 

491.38 492.74 B: right 

492.12 493.57 A: that would maybe 

493.87 498.76 A: you know that probably helped a lot today [laughter] you know where we both agreed pretty much 

496.04 497.73 B: that's i- exactly 

498.43 501.60 B: exactly how big is your your town 

501.57 504.89 A: yeah oh it's about there's about five thousand yeah 

504.15 505.29 B: [mn] oh wow 

505.00 506.55 A: four or five thousand people 

506.79 514.48 B: [laughter] i've probably got that many people within twenty square blocks [laughter] i said i said oh wow i said i've probably got that many people within twenty square blocks 

507.87 508.85 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

510.16 511.09 A: (( huh )) 

513.04 514.94 A: [laughter] isn't that something 

515.03 515.82 B: (( mm )) 

515.13 518.76 A: yeah and i grew up in a town that's about oh seven hundred people 

518.47 520.01 B: you're kidding [laughter] 

519.06 522.18 A: a little tiny town called regan in idaho and it 

522.24 524.50 A: we were surrounded by mountains 

524.59 529.85 A: so did we [mn] sure felt protected and then we moved to closer to boise and then 

526.39 527.50 B: well that's great 

529.94 535.90 A: there was a little bit of difference for me so i would if i lived in philadelphia boy i wouldn't know what to do [laughter] 

535.08 538.53 B: [laughter] you you you're considered a ah 

538.83 548.46 B: you know you're considered like living in the suburbs in a sense in the city if you've got you know ah an acre of land around you you know [noise] oh goodness you know you're [laughter] 

547.30 548.77 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

548.72 554.00 B: but but again those things i i guess getting back on that subject it does kind of affect ah 

548.87 550.02 A: wow [noise] 

554.64 558.74 B: the values you have here this i mean the city here has got 

558.78 563.38 B: [mn] crime left and right i mean it's just you know our our newspapers probably would be 

563.58 571.47 B: [noise] you know horror movies for you all and people yes- just yesterday honestly i was walking down the street i said you know i'm probably walking next to people who have 

565.85 567.35 A: oh yeah 

571.56 585.31 B: you know done this and that and the other or know about this that and the other ah yeah i- i- i- it's kinda creepy sometimes i mean philly is relatively safe i guess compared to other big cities our crime you know is is down if that's a it sounds like an oxymoron but nevertheless [mn] 

572.73 573.29 A: (( [mn] )) 

574.59 576.24 A: really [noise] [noise] 

585.35 592.21 B: but the values that people have do weigh upon their ability to make the best decision when it comes to 

592.64 595.67 B: [mn] perjury and you know telling the truth or 

595.04 596.17 A: uh-huh 

595.69 597.38 B: things along those lines 

597.43 599.89 A: right well do you feel a lot
