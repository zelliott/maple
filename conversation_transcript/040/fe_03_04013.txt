0.03 4.32 B: hi my name is corrie and i did not hear the question 

4.32 15.36 A: [laughter] i'm matt and the question is incredible they're asking ah whether we would be either of us would be willing to commit perjury for a close friend or family member 

16.00 21.96 B: oh my goodness ah [laughter] that's a pretty deep discussion [laughter] um 

17.36 18.57 A: yeah 

21.02 22.88 A: yeah 

22.14 26.54 B: i don't think i would be no i don't think i would [laughter] would you 

26.91 35.32 A: i think it would [mn] the answer is no the only thing that i could think of that would change that answer would be if um 

36.64 39.80 A: crazy situations like say you're in nazi germany 

39.80 40.83 B: uh-huh 

40.10 41.10 A: (( ah )) 

41.15 46.46 A: i can imagine ah lying to protect ah someone that i'm hiding 

46.32 47.66 B: mhm 

47.00 49.14 A: but other than that no 

49.10 54.93 B: well that's a good point i mean if it depends upon the s- the the laws of the state that you exist in 

55.16 61.01 B: so if if you think the laws are fundamentally screwed up and it's toltar- totalitarian regime or something 

61.05 62.05 A: yeah 

61.20 64.17 B: then yeah that's you're right i mean [mn] 

64.19 66.26 B: there would be instances where 

66.55 69.03 B: you'd put your family before 

69.07 71.42 B: the laws and protecting yourself 

71.51 76.19 A: yeah yeah fortunately i don't think that's the state here 

76.17 84.06 B: exactly [laughter] i guess they mean with taxes and [mn] if somebody commits a crime and and all that stuff 

84.35 87.53 B: so i don't [mn] even know of any instances of people 

87.63 93.46 B: other than things i've read in the paper [laughter] of people committing perjury for their family 

93.82 99.04 A: [laughter] [mn] yeah i guess most instances that i've heard about would be cases of the mob or 

99.33 100.39 A: um 

100.77 103.98 A: or i don't know i could im- i could imagine 

104.38 108.13 A: now i personally don't agree with this but i was talking to m- 

108.22 117.36 A: ah my aunt last night and i guess she had a friend who the brother assaulted the daughter 

117.47 123.76 A: and the mom took the side of the brother against the daughter with the cops i don't know if that's exactly perjury or what the deal is 

117.70 118.31 B: (( [noise] )) 

124.25 125.34 A: but ah 

124.31 128.93 B: [mn] yeah i i think it's perjury if you ah if you 

128.94 131.20 B: swear i- in front of a court 

131.60 132.53 A: okay 

131.78 134.14 B: i think that's just lying to the police 

134.19 140.78 B: [mn] ah i think perjury is when you actually commit yourself before court or sign 

141.08 144.70 B: you documents saying something's true when it's not 

145.48 146.68 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

146.56 148.87 A: right yeah 

146.86 147.85 B: (( but i guess )) 

148.00 151.87 B: testifying to police the story i don't know if that's 

151.92 153.64 B: i guess it's perjury if 

153.79 157.82 B: they're called before the court and have to repeat it 

157.08 158.10 A: (( [mn] right )) 

158.40 159.36 A: (( hm )) 

159.19 165.24 B: and i think [mn] there's probably a lot of perjury committed with taxes and stuff like that 

164.60 166.39 A: [mn] yeah i would guess 

167.13 170.54 A: and probably people will rationalize it by saying 

170.68 178.42 A: ah oh it's not really lying because ah of these complications so they should've taken it into account anyway 

178.29 179.44 B: mhm 

179.38 184.73 A: i'm guessing that's what most people would do it's still unethical but if it's questionable then 

182.30 183.37 B: mhm 

185.20 192.35 B: and i guess if somebody [mn] maybe there's instances of people committing murder because 

192.51 194.78 B: they were attacked by somebody else 

195.48 201.58 B: ah like say like a neighbor attacked you and there's i don't know some bad blood there or something and 

195.61 196.85 A: right 

201.04 202.28 A: right 

201.64 209.78 B: and you're trying to protect your family saying they didn't really do it ah it was self defense or i don't know [laughter] um not necessarily perjury 

209.98 217.51 A: i suppose that leads to the one case where i might i might consider it actually and that would be if ah 

218.94 224.01 A: the one set of laws in this country that i do think are a little screwy 

224.03 231.33 A: are um immigration laws and protecting um protecting immigrants with illegal i was raised along the border 

231.50 233.54 A: and there are quite a few people who 

232.72 233.30 B: (( mhm )) 

233.33 247.65 A: who come across the border and look for employment and that's technically against the law but would i would i make certain that every ah person who comes for employment if they're really needing help is a united states citizen 

247.69 248.77 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

247.98 249.85 A: ah i don't know 

250.52 254.77 B: yeah it depends what you what your views are of this country overall i've 

254.91 265.19 B: ah just been challenged in this whole area i went and spent a whole summer in europe and [mn] they i didn't realize how bad our laws are for for the new immigrants 

265.17 276.73 B: i had just shut shut my eyes to it all and maybe i'm guilty of that drawbridge mentality well my grandparents are here now and you know tough luck to anybody else who can't come afterwards um 

265.24 266.96 A: yeah 

275.85 277.34 A: [mn] yeah 

276.77 286.33 B: [laughter] but that's a whole other thing but yeah i but i always felt like if you made it to these shores no matter how you got here even crossing a a border illegally ah 

286.36 291.01 B: you're in and this is a country that should present opportunities for everybody who can get here 

291.09 292.61 A: right right [mn] 

291.85 295.42 B: but i think that's changed in the last thirty years that whole 

295.54 296.81 B: viewpoint [mn] 

296.64 301.40 A: yeah i think people have started to get paranoid and selfish economically selfish 

301.30 302.28 B: mhm 

301.56 305.90 A: america for americans the whole pat buchanan attitude 

305.37 308.00 B: yeah and what is an american [laughter] 

307.95 308.86 A: yeah 

309.19 313.02 B: i mean ah technically he's not really an american he's irish [laughter] 

312.20 314.40 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

313.92 319.89 B: [laughter] if you want to go back that far and even the indians aren't american they came over the anda- the 

318.32 319.49 A: right 

320.00 322.20 B: (( andalusia plain [laughter] )) 

321.74 323.63 A: (( right right [mn] but )) 

323.23 325.00 B: so it is that sort of [mn] 

325.28 328.07 B: (( that drawbridge mentality i always say that's ah the )) 

328.38 330.68 B: best way to describe it [mn] 

330.80 332.70 B: (( nobody else can come in [laughter] )) 

332.60 343.87 A: someone was telling me that we actually have the same refugee policy in place that that was present in world war two that turned ah boatloads of jews back to hitler 

344.54 347.56 B: i would not be surprised [laughter] 

344.88 345.56 A: (( i don- )) 

348.40 360.06 B: ah [mn] this is a point of contention i have with a lot of people i mean they seem to forget all that that america wasn't helping found the state of israel initially [laughter] you know they say that america has that has been its whole goal 

359.87 371.73 B: and i think that that whole principle still exists with certain nations i think it depends on the country if we like the country we'll let 'em in but if it's ah you know [mn] haitian refugees turn 'em back 

371.84 373.56 A: yeah 

372.58 379.28 B: you know but if it's cubans let 'em in 'cause we want to show castro how much how bad a guy he is so everybody's fleeing 

379.30 382.23 B: so it's so it's like they pick the countries that they'll 

379.40 380.41 A: right 

382.25 385.35 B: they'll allow there's definitely hypocrisy in the policy 

385.97 386.79 B: but 

386.87 388.21 A: that's crazy 

387.98 390.45 B: it is it totally is and i guess 

390.55 400.76 B: maybe if there was a circumstance i knew somebody was fleeing a country that was bad but america didn't think was bad and it was against the law for them to come i don't think i would rat out the person 

400.95 411.97 A: [mn] yeah i think yeah i agree that's the one place where i think that i i might be willing to commit perjury is if it was called ah turnover this person who's fleeing for their life 

411.75 413.81 B: (( exactly you know )) 

412.41 415.19 A: ah from a a repressive country 

415.26 419.31 B: ah naturally i would report any terrorist or [laughter] you know somebody who i'm 

418.47 419.73 A: right 

420.12 422.10 B: [noise] suspicious about but 

422.12 429.05 B: there are a lot of innocent people that gr- get grouped in oh well they're dark they're this you know they must be bad [laughter] but 

428.39 430.16 A: right 

429.06 433.69 B: they just want the same thing that we all want to live peacefully and freely and 

433.82 435.00 A: right 

433.91 435.31 B: (( a life for their families )) 

436.13 437.00 B: (( [noise] so )) 

437.23 440.07 B: (( i don't know the world's crazy these days [laughter] [noise] )) 

439.67 441.38 A: it is it is 

441.79 445.25 B: we have less compassion i think in a lot of circumstances 

446.43 448.99 B: (( and i would i'd be curious ho- you know ah )) 

449.20 456.51 B: how many people are really locked up who really shouldn't be locked up you know i i think there are a lot of bad people out there but 

456.80 457.79 B: (( i don't know )) 

458.99 464.38 B: i think there are people that they just don't want on the streets anymore and they'll keep 'em there forever [mn] 

464.47 472.57 A: [mn] [mn] yeah i don't know i don't know how one would even measure that our justice system definitely sounds better than a lot of countries i 

472.83 473.79 A: (( ah )) 

472.88 475.81 B: yeah i think you're right there [laughter] 

475.58 477.88 A: but there's probably gonna still be problems 

479.09 480.50 B: [noise] i'm sure [mn] 

481.44 482.32 B: (( so )) 

483.46 486.81 B: what's after perjury [mn] isn't there another term that's 

487.58 490.12 B: worse than perjury [noise] but along the same lines 

491.03 493.02 A: [mn] let's see there's 

492.16 493.99 B: (( are there certain degrees of )) 

494.02 495.13 B: perjury 

495.58 503.36 A: well there might be i i mean treason say protecting a spy or a terrorist or something that could be pretty bad 

503.40 506.67 A: but i don't know if that's considered along the same lines 

506.57 507.70 B: yeah 

506.87 509.26 A: of if that's considered a different kind of crime 

509.55 512.72 B: or innocently protecting someone 

513.67 517.60 B: i mean if somebody's a spy you might not know it [mn] 

517.50 518.54 A: right 

517.80 526.95 B: like that like that chinese woman who was just arrested that was she was working with the f._b._i. guy and [noise] he was sleeping with her [noise] but didn't know she was a double agent 

526.59 527.88 A: right 

527.04 538.79 B: but she he thought she was helping the us [noise] so i think when you get into that whole sphere of spying and everything you open up a whole can of worms potentially for a lot of perjury [laughter] 

538.61 540.63 A: right right 

540.29 541.79 B: (( [noise] so )) 

543.15 544.63 B: [noise] anyhow [laughter] 

544.81 546.60 B: any other questions that we can 

546.73 547.78 B: answer 

547.70 554.54 A: [mn] i don't know i think that this topic's about exhausted but the ten minute limit on this phone has not been exhausted 

553.95 558.80 B: i i think i will always remember to read up on ah 

558.98 562.35 B: [noise] legal issues before making these phone calls [laughter] 

561.98 565.15 A: yeah well the the last three topics 

565.19 568.35 A: i didn't accept one of them was 

565.84 566.68 B: [noise] 

568.69 578.76 A: i think one of them was comedy and i don't watch television so [mn] um and then the other one was life partners and i thought i'm not going to talk with a perfect stranger about life partners forget it 

571.79 572.74 B: uh-huh 

577.93 590.72 B: oh that's funny [laughter] i i think i might have answered that ah had that question but we made it that it wasn't about intimacy it was about just things that you like in people we kept it very general 

579.73 580.31 A: (( [mn] )) 

589.29 590.45 A: oh okay 

590.91 591.85 A: hm 

590.94 592.39 B: (( so [noise] )) 

592.47 598.70 B: ah just good good qualities in individuals that you want to spend your life with nothing 

597.96 599.51 A: hm
