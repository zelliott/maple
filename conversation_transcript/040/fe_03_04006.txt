43.38 54.95 A: and you know anything like that even if it was for a close friend i don't think i can live with the guilt i think i would probably try to convince my friend that you know that would be the wrong thing to do and

115.78 118.60 B: if like i don't know what like 

118.80 129.35 B: if it's not i don't know like i'm i'm thinking white lie like if you can help p- people to live longer if you tell this kind of things i think i don't know whether i would do that 

129.86 130.90 A: yeah 

131.09 133.03 B: y- you you know what i mean 

132.44 136.36 A: yeah 'cause then you have to live with that knowing that you did that you know 

134.24 135.16 B: right 

135.97 136.91 B: uh-huh 

136.43 138.06 A: even if it is you know 

138.42 143.81 A: if it's a close friend i think a close friend would understand your feelings on it 

142.16 143.20 B: mhm 

143.95 144.84 B: right 

145.42 148.54 A: you know i don't think that they would expect you to do something wrong for them 

148.42 149.41 B: (( uh-huh )) 

150.30 153.24 A: i mean that's that's my feeling a friend shouldn't 

153.64 156.59 A: you know expect another friend to do something wrong 

156.54 157.50 B: right 

157.30 159.40 A: to you know just to to help them out 

159.71 160.65 B: mhm 

161.68 170.06 B: yes yes i i guess that's right but sometimes people do this because for their like um benefits to do this 

170.58 172.17 A: oh sure yeah 

171.32 172.36 B: mhm 

172.79 174.45 B: then with the uh-huh 

173.00 173.95 A: (( but the )) 

175.18 186.54 A: yeah but but they're saying er would you do it to help out a close friend but i don't know what benefits that would be for me except knowing that i helped my friend but that's not that's not really that's not er 

178.41 179.27 B: right 

186.49 190.30 A: that's not really helping a friend by helping them to do something wrong 

187.83 188.71 B: right 

189.99 200.59 B: right i think days ago i saw a movie about law and order in t._n._t. it talks about a girl who was like raped i- in a in a pub 

196.33 197.22 A: mhm 

200.65 208.38 B: and then actually he was ra- she was raped by several guys and one of the guy's close friend was there watching it 

208.26 223.13 B: and like h- he was required to like to speak in the court and he has like kind of struggled like he sh- should he tell the truth so that so that then his friend will be in jail if he don't tell the if he like he doesn't tell the truth the girl like will 

223.25 231.54 B: will can see that that he did he was not raped but he was you know that kind of thing it's like he you know tried to ask a man either you know to 

231.49 245.43 B: have sex with her those kind of things and i was at that time i was like if b- before i know that the boy did tell the truth in the court i was trying to like tell him my heart says oh just tell the truth 

245.03 245.87 A: yeah 

245.69 250.94 B: so that you know i think if you tell the truth and you are like on the justice side 

250.81 252.03 A: right right 

251.36 252.33 B: mhm 

252.15 254.70 A: you know how the what they say the truth sets you free 

254.41 256.04 B: right [laughter] 

255.22 257.93 A: i believe that [laughter] [laughter] 

256.34 258.95 B: right the truth sets you free [laughter] 

258.12 266.79 A: because now how would he you know doing something like that even say lying for your friend like that just to save him in court but now what you're doing 

262.37 263.29 B: right 

265.13 265.96 B: mhm 

266.56 278.86 A: is you know in your heart that your friend is guilty 'cause you were there and you witnessed it so now you have to live with that the fact that this that your friend even if it is your friend got away with doing something wrong to another human being 

270.96 272.08 B: mhm 

278.61 280.66 B: right mhm 

279.37 289.81 A: you know i mean i i don't think i can live with myself though i wouldn't want to be put in that spot but if i had to be i think i'd tell my friend that you know i was gonna tell the truth 

284.43 285.46 B: uh-huh 

289.49 290.41 B: right 

289.79 295.24 A: and you know if that was gonna destroy our friendship or hurt him in any way i'm sorry but what he did was wrong 

295.15 296.92 B: uh-huh right 

296.27 298.91 A: you know that that's that's how i feel about it 

298.78 301.71 B: mhm well that's really very true 

302.05 306.21 B: is you now i think that's right [laughter] 

305.55 318.56 A: [laughter] [laughter] it's hard of me you know just think of yourself if you were gonna do something wrong yeah well i don't know i guess if it was turned around you'd want somebody to to stick up for you but that's not really doing the right thing 

306.77 307.76 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

318.12 319.72 B: right and it 

318.86 321.54 A: and they're not helping you out either by doing that 

320.53 330.58 B: yeah and when the truth is set free and then i think like people will be intimidated by doing like wrong things again like by doing bad things again 

330.43 331.53 A: that's right 

331.16 333.17 B: yeah if you're like you 

333.19 341.73 B: people like do not tell the truth and now the people person will think oh this time i was not like i was okay i was not caught maybe i can do it again 

341.78 343.06 A: that's right 

342.13 348.12 B: to the world will like evil and and more like more like bad and evil so 

347.19 351.04 A: oh definitely there's so much evil around and that's the reason why 

348.45 349.48 B: mhm 

350.92 351.93 B: right 

351.23 354.30 A: because people don't care about other human beings anymore 

353.97 355.73 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

354.60 362.72 A: you know they're they're willing to lie and cheat and steal and and everything kill for them i mean it's it's getting a little crazy you know 

360.03 360.96 B: right 

362.25 363.34 B: mhm 

362.78 365.08 A: i think somebody's got to stand firm 

365.14 370.99 A: you know in their beliefs and do the right thing and then maybe everybody else will start doing the right thing 

367.43 368.46 B: mhm 

369.82 372.48 B: right yeah the w- the wo- yes 

371.06 373.68 A: you know make this place a better world to live in 

373.28 374.45 B: right [laughter] 

374.10 375.79 A: [laughter] 

374.65 377.74 B: make the world a better place for everybody 

377.35 378.61 A: that's right 

377.99 387.98 B: mhm because the bad person who has to to be punished so that he will not have be like the kind of um you know conscience to do this again 

387.95 388.77 A: right 

387.96 394.04 B: like he will be self conscience like oh i shouldn't do this otherwise like i will be put in jail or something 

395.57 396.48 B: so 

396.52 406.85 A: yeah i think we need more religion back in the world [laughter] [laughter] oh yeah i think so i think people if people went to church more they wouldn't have those kind of beliefs you know 

396.70 397.87 B: i was thinking 

399.56 400.88 B: you really think so 

402.43 403.63 B: mhm 

406.93 414.80 B: um i was thinking that people went to church sometimes people went to church they they did not really believe in christ 

415.13 416.18 A: that's true 

416.33 418.98 A: that's v- very true there's a lot of hypocrites there you 

416.44 417.19 B: so 

418.70 419.57 B: right 

419.54 420.34 A: (( know )) 

419.75 424.01 B: i wou- yeah i think definitely that um where i think people need 

424.32 430.63 B: christ in their hearts and if there's always like really fast to my belief 

430.74 431.64 A: mhm 

431.24 434.74 B: you know i yeah i was thinking about that because a- at that 

435.01 439.74 B: before i like really believed in my in my chris- like my belief 

439.49 440.53 A: mhm 

440.13 448.25 B: i was like also hypocrite like i i sometimes like don't don't like do things especially to myself 

448.15 449.20 A: mhm 

448.64 453.52 B: but now i always like rely on him so that i can do things better 

453.47 454.37 A: right 

454.07 455.56 B: (( right so the )) 

454.66 463.79 A: yeah we all have to have some some l- a little bit of help even from above you know [laughter] we need that help you have to have something to believe in and you have to have something to follow 

457.73 458.68 B: right 

459.01 460.46 B: mhm right 

463.39 464.45 B: right 

463.87 467.86 A: otherwise everybody would be doing whatever they want you know 

466.98 468.52 B: mhm 

468.33 476.75 A: we have to go back to the the the times like little house on the prairie [laughter] where everybody had such good beliefs and that was the law you know 

472.75 473.70 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

476.14 476.98 B: (( mhm mm )) 

477.24 479.63 A: and people didn't commit those kind of crimes 

479.22 480.20 B: mhm 

481.77 486.72 B: yeah so do you think that the law um s- law is always just 

487.60 488.99 A: no i don't 

489.31 495.68 A: it's not always just it's not i- it it it definitely benefits the guilty and not the innocent 

496.18 497.09 B: why 

497.80 498.88 A: well [sigh] [lipsmack] 

500.29 503.81 A: you can be right about something and you have to 

504.50 507.58 A: i- if you're innocent you have to prove that you're innocent 

507.14 508.10 B: uh-huh 

508.00 512.20 A: and if you're guilty you still have to prove you're innocent 

511.97 512.97 B: uh-huh 

512.33 515.66 A: and it's very hard that's why a lot of people i think get arrested 

515.64 516.72 B: mhm 

516.10 518.14 A: and for the wr- you know 

518.28 529.85 A: there are innocent people that get arrested you hear that all the time you know and they they hold them in jail for a week a month whatever it is years some times and that's because they couldn't prove that they were innocent even when they were 

520.99 522.34 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

525.25 526.35 B: mhm 

529.71 530.83 B: mhm 

530.18 533.36 A: but for the guilty person look at o. j. simpson 

533.35 547.79 A: how he got away with what he did we all know he's guilty but they could not prove it and that's the whole thing they have to prove that you did something wrong but the person who didn't do anything wrong if they can't prove that they weren't there at that time they're still held guilty 

533.40 534.22 B: mhm 

535.04 536.00 B: mhm 

536.63 537.44 B: mhm 

538.08 539.11 B: (( right right )) 

546.99 547.81 B: mhm 

548.26 553.69 A: you know i i i don't i don't care for the justice system too much i don't think it really works in our favor 

553.79 554.76 B: uh-huh 

554.02 557.79 A: but [laughter] but [laughter] i really don't 

555.29 556.23 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

558.02 560.25 A: but you know it's uh 

560.34 562.80 A: it's good for the guilty [laughter] 

562.01 563.24 B: mhm 

563.35 564.22 B: well 

563.41 567.24 A: well we can't help these people to be guilty that's for sure [laughter] 

567.03 577.72 B: yeah i i i i think what you have said like use kind of um paradox when you said th- the um the law system is like good for the guilty 

567.30 568.14 A: [laughter] 

577.44 578.43 A: mhm 

577.81 582.10 B: but actually like y- you know why we have law because we want to like 

582.22 588.39 B: to to do benefit for the good so that and prevent people d- doing something evil things 

588.51 595.19 A: yeah but it only it only keeps the good people from doing the bad things it doesn't stop the bad people from doing the bad things 

592.40 593.27 B: uh-huh 

594.55 595.99 B: [laughter] 

595.32 599.89 A: they still do it anyway they do it anyway and they hope to get to get away with it 

597.08 598.11 B: (( right )) 

599.54 599.89 B: (( oh ))
