9.99 12.64 B: the weather looks like it's gonna storm but otherwise it's okay 

12.15 15.54 A: yeah yeah well i'm in rocksberry it got pretty windy all of a sudden 

15.09 16.39 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

15.79 19.74 A: yeah so uh opening businesses eh 

19.33 33.90 B: yeah um i don't know i guess i was just thinking about that if i opened my own business it'd probably be something like a pharmacy um either a pharmacy or something like a doctor's office where you could hire doctors because like where you get the most money and what's not affected by the economy isn't that true 

20.20 21.35 A: hm 

25.92 26.88 A: yes 

33.70 34.69 A: yes 

34.22 37.08 B: you know doctor doctors are not affected 

37.44 44.13 B: they're they're still gonna be able to charge the insurance companies a lot of money and pharmacies are still gonna be able to charge a lot of money for prescriptions 

43.91 44.85 A: yes 

44.58 45.89 B: so what do you think 

45.80 47.85 A: uh well [laughter] 

47.87 52.59 A: uh i guess that's all true doctors and and morticians and such 

52.53 53.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

53.09 55.51 A: you know they'll they'll always have a steady supply 

56.13 67.42 A: uh some doctors might be hurt such as those who deal in elective surgeries and cosmetic surgeries and the like by a poor economy but other than that you're right 

67.08 69.52 B: well what kind of business would you be interested in opening 

69.48 71.66 A: uh well 

72.08 77.95 A: i probably wouldn't have the heart to to run a successful business you know uh 

78.31 82.66 A: unless it was something so good that i that i had a large enough margin to 

82.88 84.77 A: to be generous here and there 

85.63 87.54 A: (( you know i'd i'd want to uh )) 

87.98 92.92 A: uh [laughter] maybe maybe a bookstore or a music store 

93.39 98.25 B: you wouldn't be opening like a business mostly for money mostly just like or pleasure entertainment 

97.90 109.16 A: yes yes and hopefully it would work out but uh you know i wouldn't if if i had a million dollars to invest i wouldn't hire me as a general manager 

108.94 110.54 B: any particular reason why 

110.79 114.15 A: uh it's just not what i'm after you know 

115.24 116.96 A: that's that's all i can tell you 

116.62 124.82 B: what if you'd have like a i guess like a million dollars and you can invest it in either other than that you'd probably lose it would you then just do like a bookstore something that would be 

124.86 128.04 B: assuming that you'd have to open a business or something that would make more money 

127.81 136.20 A: well uh i'd i'd probably invest most of it and check in once a day and uh have some sort of venture 

136.47 139.14 A: you know some place where i sit and uh 

139.67 141.34 A: make recommendations 

142.07 145.71 A: and i'd have a bookstore with very few bestsellers in it 

145.53 148.84 B: and then what about if you could hire a manager for your business 

149.42 152.31 B: then would you change i guess your business preference 

152.55 153.76 A: uh 

153.97 158.98 A: [laughter] it would you see i 

159.10 162.04 A: any profit would be consequential you see 

161.44 162.34 B: mhm 

163.17 164.47 A: and uh 

164.53 168.62 A: you remember you ever read about when the when the beatles started their own record company 

168.66 169.53 B: (( no )) 

169.52 170.54 A: well they 

170.88 180.16 A: it was a very idealistic venture and they didn't know much and they they got ripped off severely they lost a lot of money people were stealing left and right 

180.30 184.47 A: and i would i would try and do something like that but without uh 

184.80 188.46 A: without the latter part of it if such a thing is possible 

186.68 187.45 B: (( [laughter] )) 

189.75 190.67 B: okay 

190.43 193.98 A: i know it's i know it can be done it's just very difficult 

194.78 195.68 A: so 

196.06 198.19 A: i'm sure this all sounds very foreign 

198.21 199.04 B: [laughter] 

199.77 203.39 B: would you be interested in opening like anything else besides like a bookstore a music store 

203.48 208.57 A: uh well i'm sure i could think of something that's all that occurred to me all of a sudden though 

209.74 215.20 B: [noise] yeah i think if you're actually making the profit i would think i i go to [noise] business school so 

212.33 213.28 A: yes 

215.60 216.51 B: um 

216.10 222.54 A: (( yeah yes )) 

216.86 221.05 B: i think at that point a profit would be very important if you're opening a business and you don't the money you've just 

221.13 223.06 B: got to make money out of it 

222.62 224.15 A: of course yes 

224.49 225.07 A: (( [mn] )) 

225.36 227.62 A: was is this your your first call 

227.43 228.21 B: yes 

227.96 230.58 A: oh yeah last week it was uh 

230.69 232.19 A: sports on television 

232.31 233.46 B: (( oh really [laughter] )) 

232.86 234.81 A: which was a little bit easier for me 

234.98 237.88 A: even though i don't watch much sports on t._v. either 

236.90 239.37 B: (( yeah i think that would be a harder topic for me )) 

238.72 243.57 A: yeah [laughter] [cough] hm 

239.79 242.57 B: (( sports on television i don't know much about sports )) 

243.03 247.64 B: what about that's actually an interesting idea like opening like a sports arena like a sports um 

247.65 248.49 B: sports 

248.50 251.95 B: like a center for like children or teenagers or something 

251.61 252.73 A: oh sure 

253.27 256.53 B: that could actually be quite profitable if you charge money for like a gym 

255.29 258.25 A: (( yeah )) 

257.34 259.13 B: for sports and stuff like that 

259.24 265.31 B: and you could actually have it probably sponsored by the city like introducing children and teenagers to fitness 

259.44 265.00 A: (( yes )) 

265.05 267.54 A: yeah yes and there'd be a lot of supervision 

267.74 269.79 B: does something like that already exist do you know 

269.75 271.04 A: yes yes 

270.87 275.65 B: oh so then that doesn't like for children actually is it government sponsored i mean does 

275.81 278.15 B: the government actually give more money towards it 

278.39 281.45 A: uh you mean after school uh 

281.42 290.87 B: well i guess it's kinda like yeah like after school like fitness programs but not necessarily sports but also like gyms and individuals are shown how to properly use different sort of equipment 

290.87 291.66 A: huh 

291.45 292.65 B: things like that 

292.05 293.91 A: well it's think it's kinda you 

294.19 301.44 A: know i remember when i was a kid there was the salvation army uh in the in the eighties and it cost a quarter to get in 

301.30 310.79 B: but doesn't the salvation army usually it's only for like i guess the lower class or the poorer children in the area i guess it's kinda segregated if you know what i mean the salvation army 

307.25 309.95 A: uh well 

310.34 316.59 A: now they're they're all over the place you know this is a half decent area and we've got a salvation army right up the street 

316.98 318.96 A: (( in the adult rehabilitation center )) 

319.54 320.75 A: and uh 

320.90 324.46 A: with a decent gym you know and they had a basketball court and a game 

325.33 328.10 B: and you just paid each time to get in or is it like 

325.84 329.72 A: room yeah twenty five cents 

329.35 330.34 B: (( oh okay )) 

329.97 331.34 A: yeah [laughter] 

331.52 335.05 A: it was a a token fee then it was a dollar later on 

335.53 337.70 B: are they still open do they still do something like that 

337.56 342.30 A: i don't think so i'm not sure why probably insurance costs 

342.14 343.06 B: insurance 

343.13 346.64 B: isn't it like can't like parents be forced to sign a release waiver for this 

346.37 348.24 A: what was that 

347.09 350.70 B: can't like i guess parents or whatever sign a release waiver for 

350.66 354.35 A: uh perhaps but most such waivers don't hold up 

354.87 363.71 A: you know if if there's a puddle of water on the floor you know if the parents sign the waiver if the kid slips and gets hurt uh it's a lot of trouble regardless 

364.15 365.27 A: even if 

364.25 366.34 B: really even if there's a waiver signed 

365.64 373.73 A: even if it was just five minutes before that another kid whose parents signed a waiver spilled the water on the floor if somebody slips and falls there's big trouble 

372.14 376.45 B: but then who they sue do they sue the people that didn't clean up or the 

375.61 377.06 A: that's correct 

378.30 379.77 A: (( yes yes )) 

380.14 383.89 B: [mn] yeah i'd figured that they'd have some kind of like special insurance protection for that 

383.59 386.51 A: uh well you know 

387.55 388.58 A: (( [noise] )) 

387.58 392.81 B: or they'd be i guess like you know make sure no food or drinks and make sure that it's all carefully done 

388.60 390.62 A: a lot of 

392.88 400.10 A: well you have to hire a lot of people to monitor that and then you can't have twenty five cent admission if you have a lot of monitors 

400.51 401.62 B: that's true 

401.26 406.57 A: so the fear of injury has squashed a lot of fun in this country in the last ten or twenty years 

406.61 411.03 B: well i guess the question is is it still um like do these things still exist 

411.56 413.90 B: if insurance is still an issue for them 

413.56 421.30 A: yeah yeah no the school district of philadelphia pays uh about four thousand dollars a kid per year just for insurance 

421.08 422.68 B: just for insurance 

422.06 423.90 A: yes yes 

422.85 427.05 B: i thought the total cost of children going to school is like five or six thousand dollars 

427.85 430.76 A: yes and a large proportion of that is insurance 

431.07 436.93 B: really i i wonder why it's that high you'd figure like it's not that it's something like very common 

431.70 434.34 A: yes 

436.61 441.25 A: well there's fire and other building problems and there's uh 

441.42 454.52 A: injuries that students inflict upon each other for which the school district is responsible and there's uh the occasional abuse suit teachers upon students which everybody pays for 

454.19 459.19 B: well yeah i never knew that insurance was so high having gone through the philadelphia school district 

456.63 458.25 A: yeah 

459.94 460.71 B: well 

460.67 462.64 A: [mn] it's terrible 

462.15 464.74 B: well then maybe an insurance company would be a good venture 

464.46 465.53 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

465.15 473.17 B: even though insurance companies are very good like i guess keeping a brand and that you're having a brand name but if you come into the market with a lower price then 

471.91 473.74 A: (( [laughter] )) 

473.79 476.92 B: you could probably get a lot of customers very quickly and then 

477.18 479.51 B: as long as you keep them satisfied build from there on 

477.26 478.65 A: (( [mn] yes )) 

479.43 480.39 A: yes 

481.04 483.67 A: all right so 

484.01 485.56 A: and uh you know 

485.88 490.24 A: a restaurant is fun but of them fail it's said 

489.84 495.95 B: yeah i think restaurants isn't it like a ninety percent i think out of like all new businesses there's like there's like over ninety percent fail 

495.64 497.36 A: yes 

496.13 497.84 B: in the first six months or something 

497.91 499.27 A: (( [mn] )) 

499.75 504.05 A: and uh what else is there well you look at 

504.28 510.80 A: try and look at what's successful like you know chinese takeouts for example they have all their relatives working 

510.21 514.40 B: well yeah but i mean with all the stuff going right now it's not a very successful business to open 

514.42 517.71 A: yeah well huh it's 

514.96 515.75 B: [laughter] 

516.54 529.29 B: i mean there's actually one that just opened like uh near my house a chinese takeout place and it was you know they give a thirty coupon and it's like three dollars or two fifty a meal and it was still relatively when i walked into it like it's you know it's the first week of opening 

525.09 525.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

529.17 532.40 A: well that's just because of s. a. r. s. right all of a sudden 

531.02 536.30 B: yeah but i mean but i'm thinking just something that could be so easily affected by the economy or things that are going on 

535.94 536.91 A: yes 

536.25 548.42 B: while you always need car insurance you always need a hospital you always need a doctor there are certain things just like you know um in academia you usually always need teachers and you always need professors at universities [noise] 

547.67 548.61 A: yes 

549.42 551.01 A: (( all right huh )) 

551.03 558.66 A: well i guess uh you're you're probably safe with the the two that you came up with well doctors and [mn] undertakers 

558.03 558.97 B: mhm 

558.78 560.04 A: hm 

559.40 560.64 B: yeah 

560.38 562.61 A: i'm sure you could come up with another one or two 

563.08 564.07 B: (( [laughter] [lipsmack] )) 

565.29 567.18 A: [noise] so where do you to school anyway 

566.82 568.07 B: i go to penn 

567.88 571.66 A: oh yeah okay and where you come across this 

568.08 570.14 B: actually just graduated 

571.72 573.64 B: (( uh um on a website )) 

573.47 575.93 A: (( oh i got it out of the philadelphia weekly )) 

575.69 579.59 B: oh okay yeah they have it like advertised in different types of websites 

576.33 577.26 A: yeah 

579.04 579.95 A: yes 

580.43 581.69 A: (( all right )) 

581.29 584.99 B: it's funny how people like they put people like connect people in the same city 

584.67 588.45 A: yes well it the last time i spoke to a lady from winnipeg 

588.81 589.56 B: oh 

589.62 591.38 A: yeah
