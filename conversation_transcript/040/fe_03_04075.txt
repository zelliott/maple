15.41 17.82 A: (( yeahs [laughter] )) 

16.71 23.95 B: ah well the only kind of business that i think i would be into would be arts and crafts because i like 

22.60 27.11 A: (( oh we're on the same wavelength then [laughter] )) 

25.17 30.91 B: [laughter] because i like to do a lot of crafts and i have done craft shows 

30.72 31.82 A: oh cool 

31.66 32.71 B: right 

32.73 34.51 A: what kind of crafts are you in to 

34.29 42.44 B: well i like miniatures for doll houses and just ordinary crafts you know for the uh house uh 

42.39 52.08 B: oh wreaths for the front door and uh little cut outs of wood and all but it's gotten so that it hasn't been that profitable because they've been 

51.88 64.63 B: raising you know you would do them at various malls or churches or so on and the price that they want for a table any more is like a hundred dollars and i mean that's like for one day or 

64.44 71.16 B: sometimes two days so sometimes you know you hardly make enough for the hours that you put in 

71.05 72.06 A: right 

72.29 77.13 A: if i could start a business i think i'd do candles i i like the candles 

74.89 76.00 B: candles 

76.47 78.01 B: oh do you make them 

77.91 80.71 A: yeah i made some today i made blueberry today 

80.30 81.67 B: oh 

81.22 87.14 A: uh they're made with the soy wax which is a natural wax made out of vegetable oil 

86.93 88.13 B: oh mm 

88.51 91.92 A: and so that's that's what i'd like to get into 

91.55 94.17 B: oh i've never tried my hand at that 

93.82 95.61 A: oh it's it's simple 

95.38 96.50 B: mhm 

96.27 99.58 A: it's uh just the wax flakes and ya melt 'em in a 

99.66 108.63 A: pot and get 'em to the temperature of one hundred and seventy five and then you add your color and when it cools down to one forty you add your fragrance 

103.56 104.39 B: (( do you )) 

108.78 113.02 B: do you have to have a lot of molds then various different moulds 

112.48 117.43 A: no i'm making them uh and pouring them in the eight ounce jelly jars 

116.49 120.57 B: oh mhm and then do you d- decorate the jars 

120.89 126.16 A: no not really because they're got already the decorative lids that i screw back on 'em 

126.24 127.30 B: oh 

127.42 128.61 B: mhm [lipsmack] 

127.89 132.78 A: so i thought i'd try that for a little while just uh family and friends 

131.00 132.04 B: now where do 

132.40 139.59 B: oh right that's- that's what i do most of my crafts for any more is you know for the neighbors and family and friends 

139.41 140.39 A: right 

140.27 141.24 B: right 

141.38 147.73 B: uh [mn] do you find it very profitable though making these candles i mean how is the expense [mn] [noise] [noise] 

147.90 160.10 A: [lipsmack] well uh the other day i spent one a hundred and forty dollars and that included fifty pounds of my soy wax which a pound will make two eight ounce jelly jars and a little bit left over for like a little 

161.04 162.48 A: and the 

162.91 168.21 A: fragrances my colors my wicks that included everything 

168.49 172.43 A: and i can probably make probably a hundred and fifty candles out of it 

171.74 173.29 B: (( oh [mn] )) 

172.61 174.79 A: so that isn't too bad 

174.13 178.51 B: er no so it would be almost like a little over a dollar a candle 

178.32 183.41 A: right right and then you know the jars and stuff like that was separate so 

178.89 180.86 B: right mhm 

183.01 184.10 B: right 

183.49 185.60 A: you'd have to count that cost too 

185.13 189.21 B: right mhm it sounds like a fun project 

189.11 193.48 A: right [laughter] and i do a lot of coupon and refunding so 

189.79 190.86 B: [laughter] 

192.57 196.35 B: oh do you do you belong to refunding makes sense 

195.93 199.64 A: (( yes plus i figured that was a )) 

196.55 198.04 B: [laughter] 

199.86 206.00 A: so we could make a business by uh yard selling flea markets [laughter] 

201.03 201.68 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

203.05 207.88 B: [laughter] [laughter] do you read chit chat every day 

207.58 208.99 A: (( exactly )) 

208.39 218.38 B: oh yes [sigh] you know when we go away on vacation and come back oh it's terrible i gotta get caught up with all all the days that i missed [laughter] 

209.27 210.98 A: (( [laughter] )) 

217.36 219.85 A: exactly exactly 

219.67 221.23 B: mhm 

220.59 222.18 A: and what was your name again 

221.85 223.62 B: karen hendrix 

223.16 224.16 A: karen 

223.91 224.86 B: (( right )) 

225.10 226.51 B: in ohio 

227.47 229.19 A: and mine is julie 

229.10 230.16 B: right 

230.52 231.83 B: mhm 

231.18 238.19 A: oh well cool i i i figured you know the 'cause i i've noticed where a lot of people were was gonna sign up for that sur- 

232.06 233.04 B: right 

237.68 242.66 B: right because that's where we saw it on chit chat right mhm 

240.78 243.66 A: yep yep i signed up last night 

243.31 244.90 B: oh oh so did i 

244.72 246.00 A: well cool 

245.36 248.42 B: so this was real quick response wasn't it 

247.78 250.25 A: yes it was real quick 

248.58 258.95 B: right mhm but you know really we i i don't know if i'd really want to have my own business when you stop and think about all the taxes that you have to pay 

258.86 270.49 B: and you know all the expenses you know like if you wanted to sell your candles or i wanted to sell my crafts in a store i mean [mn] you know your time you would get nothing for it 

270.34 282.28 A: exactly well plus uh it's my understanding like i'm making the candles that if you like would sell in like wholesale sort of to like a business you would have to have liability insurance 

279.16 280.22 B: mhm 

281.79 284.62 B: [mn] right and that would cost you a fortune 

284.03 285.69 A: exactly so 

284.93 285.94 B: right 

286.11 294.84 B: so consequently i just do it you you know where you do make out good though with with crafts and things like that if you work in an office 

294.50 296.40 A: (( exactly )) 

295.18 305.51 B: and you take one thing and put it on your desk and everybody wants to know where did you get it and i mean the- then you can really make a a profit 

305.04 306.00 A: right 

305.54 313.50 B: but otherwise i mean if you have to go and sell it on your own and you know contact businesses it it really isn't worthwhile 

313.37 314.59 A: (( right )) 

313.71 318.56 B: i don't think so you know your time you're getting about ten cents an hour in the long run 

318.30 320.73 A: exactly if you even make that 

320.19 321.75 B: (( oh er right )) 

321.13 328.77 A: you know because you spend a lot of time on the internet finding out where to get your supplies the best prices and 

325.35 327.00 B: [mn] er right and then 

327.87 339.48 B: yes or if you go and get them locally you know your gas and your time to go and pick them up and all so in the long run you know i i i don't think i would wanna have my own business 

333.76 335.23 A: yeah 

339.19 341.28 A: i don't think so too neither 

342.20 349.83 A: i i mean i've thought about doing several different businesses i mean i have ideas all the time but nothing ever pans out 

349.22 352.27 B: (( right right mhm [noise] [mn] [sigh] )) 

350.24 351.60 A: [laughter] 

351.96 358.33 A: because eventually you get tired of it especially the same craft over and over the same candle or 

356.56 357.66 B: (( er yes )) 

357.91 359.08 B: yes 

359.29 365.52 B: you know unle- unless you're doing like different shapes and all but even after a while that gets old hat 

365.05 374.28 A: it d- it does i mean especially if you get too much of a demand and there you are just having to make it over and it's it's not as enjoyable 

366.11 367.46 B: right 

374.42 375.86 A: any more to you 

375.49 381.23 B: you're not being creative you're just uh like a robot you know yes 

376.93 378.29 A: (( exactly )) 

379.33 383.27 A: (( a repeat repeat [laughter] so )) 

381.48 385.91 B: yes mhm no i like to do all different things b- 

384.70 387.74 A: (( and that's the way with me crochet and )) 

387.69 390.06 B: now i knit i don't crochet 

390.10 391.18 A: oh cool 

390.94 391.93 B: right 

391.31 393.17 A: i i i crochet 

393.02 395.32 B: mhm [noise] right 

394.06 397.52 A: but i don't i don't do that a whole lot anymore but 

396.89 401.37 B: right well i like miniatures and i belong to a miniature club and we 

401.36 412.35 B: meet every month and we make little miniatures for our dollhouse and then i did sell some of those at craft shows but you know when you go to a regular miniature show and you see the prices 

412.11 423.59 B: like five ten dollars for just some little thing and then when you go to a local ordinary craft show and you ask two dollars for it the people are oh two dollars that's ridiculous 

423.00 428.03 A: yes they don't understand the time and the money and the effort put into it 

427.38 429.57 B: right mhm 

429.23 430.26 A: so 

429.58 433.75 B: right but i enjoy doing it for my- you know my self
