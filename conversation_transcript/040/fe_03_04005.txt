3.96 5.21 A: how are you 

4.10 5.13 B: hi 

5.24 5.96 A: (( [mn] )) 

5.80 6.88 B: how are you

14.86 18.10 B: uh danielle hi uh my my name is susan 

18.22 23.03 A: susan okay well we're supposed to talk about perjury 

19.92 20.95 B: yeah 

23.41 26.32 B: perjury oh okay [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

25.35 29.98 A: and and whether we would [lipsmack] uh commit perjury for a good friend 

30.26 36.26 B: oh okay so wh- what do you uh what do you usually perjure [noise] 

37.77 39.89 A: well i don't think i would c- commit 

40.15 44.06 A: perjury assuming that it would be putting myself in jeopardy 

45.16 46.42 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

46.90 53.23 B: uh can you spell perjury wh- what what uh i need to look up in dictionary [laughter] 

52.69 55.03 A: okay it's p. e. r. 

54.97 56.43 B: p. e. r. 

56.36 58.98 A: j. u. r. y. 

58.79 62.37 B: [noise] p. e. r. j. u. r. y. 

62.23 63.07 A: right 

63.72 65.08 B: (( ah )) 

66.67 68.51 B: oh i see 

68.51 70.76 A: what does it say [laughter] 

70.12 74.29 B: (( uh [laughter] it's like er to make a false statement )) 

74.01 75.23 A: (( yeah )) 

74.43 77.79 B: is that right oh [laughter] 

75.69 77.72 A: right it's to lie 

77.99 80.99 B: oh i see i mistaken [laughter] 

79.77 80.33 A: (( yeah )) 

80.73 87.15 A: so i think the the question is whether we would lie um for a good friend 

84.93 85.91 B: mhm 

87.32 88.37 B: oh 

88.44 92.46 B: i i think it depends on how serious it is right 

93.05 95.41 B: what do you think [laughter] mhm 

93.23 94.03 A: that's 

94.78 98.37 A: oh that that's true if it was if it was just a little 

98.44 103.04 A: minor thing that would help them and wouldn't hurt anybody else then i would probably 

103.88 105.99 A: be more likely to go along with that 

103.91 104.95 B: mhm 

106.52 118.27 B: yeah i think um does that does a perjury mean that it's in front of a jury or it's just something that we do sometimes uh among talking with 

118.31 119.69 B: among friends 

121.16 124.02 A: well i wouldn't do it in court no [laughter] 

123.41 128.62 B: [laughter] oh okay yeah in court we gonna uh to commit any perjury right 

128.14 129.88 A: no no 

129.85 133.32 B: yeah but i think sometimes 

133.36 135.12 B: (( um mm like uh i )) 

135.52 137.16 B: like i probably won't 

137.19 141.17 B: because if i know like my friends did something wrong 

141.50 147.69 B: and somebody asked me i'd probably won't tell him the uh exact story [laughter] yeah 

147.25 148.36 A: yeah 

148.56 149.46 A: well 

149.68 150.60 B: mhm 

149.75 155.17 A: again it uh in my case i think it depends on whether anybody else would be hurt by it 

155.26 160.67 B: uh-huh yeah and and i also think that it depends on how serious 

160.93 163.34 B: the mistake or crime is 

162.57 164.38 A: mm mhm it 

163.56 171.15 B: (( i think if it yeah i think if it is really serious then i think uh we shouldn't lie [laughter] )) 

171.49 173.99 B: (( for a friend uh and maybe )) 

171.55 176.36 A: well i think it and and maybe i haven't looked up the definition but i think 

176.58 182.42 A: i usually associate perjury with something legal so maybe it does mean 

180.94 182.32 B: oh legal 

182.53 183.54 B: mhm 

182.78 186.17 A: maybe it does mean more serious situations 

185.60 187.40 B: [noise] oh okay 

187.91 200.63 B: uh if it's er more serious situation i think then probably we shouldn't do any perjury but we can remain silent right if we don't want to like hurt our friends or family 

194.03 194.88 A: yeah 

198.52 199.69 A: yeah 

201.36 204.41 B: we can select not not to say anything 

201.41 202.82 A: [noise] that's true 

205.09 207.47 A: that's true that's another choice 

205.48 206.29 B: (( right )) 

207.43 208.82 B: oh okay 

209.38 211.07 B: so h- have you ever 

211.09 211.96 B: um 

212.32 215.64 B: have you ever been um a jury duty 

216.14 219.79 A: um no i have been called for jury duty 

220.01 222.54 A: um and i've been 

220.12 221.10 B: oh 

223.11 228.00 A: up for cases none of them involved perjury [noise] um 

228.31 229.27 B: mhm 

229.06 233.33 A: but i never was selected for the jury so i have never sat on a jury 

234.18 238.41 B: ah i see so you never have to go to the courtroom 

239.03 240.00 A: no 

239.37 241.18 B: too oh okay 

242.03 244.40 B: (( [noise] oh that's good i have never i )) 

244.46 248.70 B: i have never been to the court actually [laughter] i don't 

247.23 249.11 A: you haven't either no 

248.74 251.39 B: (( [mn] yeah i've never been uh )) 

251.93 254.59 B: e- either a verdict or 

254.83 259.42 B: (( or j- jury i have never been there [laughter] so )) 

256.63 257.67 A: right 

258.24 261.22 A: no i have never uh i guess i never have either 

261.75 265.50 B: ah [laughter] i'm glad i don't have to [laughter] 

264.37 271.83 A: yeah [laughter] um i'm just remembering things on television i guess when when they talk about people committing perjury 

265.94 266.99 B: it 

271.77 272.78 B: uh-huh 

273.41 276.07 B: yeah yeah most of the 

276.17 278.95 B: what i know is from the [noise] t._v. 

278.68 280.65 A: yeah well uh 

279.56 281.80 B: yeah like from the newspaper 

281.81 285.06 A: i wonder what the difference is between 

285.03 286.02 B: uh-huh 

285.47 288.60 A: er why they say perjury instead of just saying lie 

289.12 292.45 A: there must be more to it than just being a lie 

289.39 290.33 B: oh 

292.87 299.39 B: oh yeah then i think it's probably uh like you said er are related to a legal issue 

299.08 300.74 A: yeah that's 

299.74 301.62 B: not just a common 

301.88 303.12 B: situation 

302.12 304.14 A: that's probably it 

303.94 305.06 B: mhm 

305.25 305.81 A: (( [cough] )) 

306.13 314.36 B: yeah [noise] so er uh h- how many time have you been called for this uh conversation this kind of um conversa- -tion

399.81 400.73 A: um 

399.83 400.85 B: mhm 

401.52 409.08 A: or if i don't think the actual topic is important they just wanted to keep us talking [noise] for them to under- 

405.73 406.62 B: mhm 

409.22 410.18 A: to 

409.53 411.71 B: oh yeah i think 

411.58 413.07 A: study it somehow 

413.53 420.62 B: yeah so we should go back to the perjury [noise] topic right [laughter] we've been off topic for a while 

416.91 418.22 A: [laughter] 

421.73 422.72 B: (( so )) 

423.42 429.99 B: i i know i have a friend he went to the court for a month to perform the jury duty 

423.62 424.24 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

431.08 432.71 A: for a month

440.30 441.32 A: (( oh )) 

441.29 443.77 B: yeah i heard it's a murder case 

444.51 446.62 A: wow that's a long time 

446.59 449.17 B: yeah that's why it took him so long 

449.03 450.16 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

450.00 456.01 B: uh i heard that it's uh finally [noise] i think they they decided the uh 

456.10 458.14 B: [lipsmack] the person is guilty 

459.40 460.48 A: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

460.67 461.86 B: yeah 

461.72 464.68 A: well i wonder if there was any perjury in that case 

465.14 469.15 B: hm yeah i don't know but i think somehow 

469.32 475.54 B: somehow i think people are not totally honest yeah even in front of a jury [laughter] 

473.76 475.39 A: no unfortun- 

475.44 479.62 A: i think you're right that's that's unfortunately the case 

479.69 482.55 B: yeah i think that's er human 

480.36 483.10 A: and uh dishonesty is very common 

483.23 486.41 B: yeah and it's a human nature i think [laughter] 

487.99 492.02 B: especially the defendant himself i think that er 

491.85 493.05 A: yeah 

492.40 495.36 B: e- everyone will try to like uh 

495.83 498.85 B: try to make himself look good and 

499.01 502.32 B: [laughter] not to be sentenced to any penalty 

500.53 501.64 A: yeah 

502.79 503.70 A: yeah 

504.00 504.70 B: (( [laughter] )) 

505.71 509.62 B: so a- and it's hard to tell if the person is lying right 

510.51 513.72 B: i know they have some lie detectors but i 

510.68 511.53 A: yes 

513.97 517.57 B: don't think that's er er that's a uh 

517.73 520.73 B: one hundred percent uh correct 

519.38 525.15 A: yeah except for my children i can do pretty good with telling my chil- when my children are lying [laughter] yah 

524.71 528.86 B: oh really [laughter] h- how many kids do you have
