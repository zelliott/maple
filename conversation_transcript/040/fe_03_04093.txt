75.39 76.65 A: (( mhm )) 

80.21 93.40 B: groups so in that case i might be writing about a a non profit organization's particular program you know they might have a program where they give bikes to underprivileged kids or something like that so so i kinda enjoy it because i get to learn a lot about 

85.54 86.82 A: oh okay 

88.61 91.23 A: mhm oh okay well it's 

93.29 99.17 B: a lot of different things in the community and you know it's neat keeps me active how about you 

96.27 97.98 A: oh that's nice uh-huh 

98.50 113.41 A: well [lipsmack] i was just discussing this with my husband the other day and i was thinking if i had uh to do a business and i had no money problems in the world i would go out and start up my own bakery [laughter] um my own bakery yeah because i really love to cook and really love to bake 

108.03 109.30 B: your own what 

109.47 111.58 B: (( bakery oh that's great )) 

113.25 122.24 A: and i was just telling my husband you know if you could make competitive donuts and stuff like that and you know um like the cakes i don't like them that they make here in the big stores and stuff you know like kmart and 

120.81 122.07 B: mhm 

122.30 124.17 A: i think they're just too too dry 

124.02 125.15 B: mhm 

124.41 137.09 A: so i like to make the cakes [noise] that are a little more moist [laughter] and decorate them for birthdays and stuff you know and start out with um like starting it running from home and give free samples to people and once they like it 

128.56 129.76 B: (( oh that's great )) 

135.18 136.17 B: mhm 

137.04 140.05 A: you know then that's how you attract customers 

139.58 142.19 B: oh yeah that's a great way 

140.09 144.15 A: yeah so i'd like to start it off low scale and then make it a big thing 

143.97 146.62 B: so do you think you might pursue it or 

145.48 150.38 A: i might pursue it but i need some capital for that which i really don't have right now [laughter] 

149.26 154.52 B: yeah that's hard 'cause i guess you'd have to work in your own kitchen to get started and 

152.34 161.15 A: exactly and yeh [lipsmack] and then if it's if it get goes well then hire people and so on and so forth so maybe it's something in the food service industry most probably 

160.84 165.29 B: oh that would be interesting do you have a background in that or is it just an interest 

161.90 163.27 A: yeah 

163.55 166.85 A: well act- just mys- my own inner interest 

166.68 167.62 B: okay 

166.74 176.10 A: that's all yeah or besides that i'd like to go out and do some um flower arrangement yeah you know i i like you know the store michaels they have [mn] you know 

171.92 172.91 B: uh-huh 

175.43 176.21 B: uh-huh 

176.00 182.87 A: yeah i've learned a few classes from there so i was just thinking you know i mean let's go and decorate somebody's wedding or something else 

181.88 191.59 B: oh yeah that'd be great i tried to do that once for somebody [laughter] for a favor for a family member it came out okay but it it was not something i think i would ever do again it 

186.08 187.39 A: did it work 

188.55 189.85 A: (( mhm )) 

190.55 199.84 A: do again yeah it it seems pretty interesting but it's really competitive i mean i don't know how how i'd stand in that market but i'd like to give it a shot and see if it works out 

191.93 194.22 B: (( takes a lot of time and )) 

199.33 203.95 B: mm have you done any research into either one to kinda see what would be involved 

201.62 206.44 A: well just books and and [mn] personal just experiments and stuff like that 

206.31 220.64 A: and also um just making stuff for the house and decorating the house and stuff and i've i've made a few for my sister like flower arrangements and stuff and i keep on baking so they know i'm you know [laughter] so when anybody come to my house something is ready and prepared 

217.29 218.14 B: (( mhm mhm oh )) 

221.14 223.57 A: to eat and stuff yeah so 

221.15 222.97 B: (( that's good )) 

223.06 228.03 B: so would it be a second job or is it are you do you work now or 

226.97 234.30 A: well i'm a stay at home mom now i used to work at bank before yeah you too yeah so my daughter was born ten months ago 

228.91 230.91 B: okay i am too [laughter] 

231.15 232.60 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

233.90 235.22 B: (( oh okay )) 

234.40 241.52 A: yeah so you know i mean i just i just can't put her in daycare i mean it's just too hard for me yeah [laughter] what about you 

238.09 241.07 B: i'm the same way [laughter] 

241.24 246.22 B: yeah i'm the same way you know that's part of why i started working on my own um 

242.37 243.27 A: uh-huh 

244.76 246.11 A: [noise] uh-huh 

246.18 249.17 B: actually when i left my last job 

249.05 261.67 B: um they kind of kept me on part time for a while 'til they hired somebody so that kind of got my feet wet i kind of got at the handle for can i work and you know watch her at the same time and it is hard but 

251.65 252.80 A: (( mhm )) 

253.27 254.98 A: uh-huh are you into h- 

256.27 257.75 A: [laughter] 

258.33 260.99 A: it's it's hard uh-huh 

261.20 275.35 A: i was thinking about it but i'm just like it's too hard you know i mean your kid needs you and then you come home and it's just really hard and i'm just like forget it i can put work later and i have to take care of her first when she's five years old then maybe i'll think about it [laughter] 

264.30 265.38 B: yeah 

267.97 269.23 B: yeah 

271.96 273.09 B: yeah 

274.20 278.93 B: yeah well the nice thing about what i do is i can i pretty much just work when she's sleeping 

278.35 279.84 A: (( mhm )) 

279.11 287.60 B: so um you know i can kind of schedule my phone calls and occasionally i have to go in for a meeting or or whatever but i try to work 

284.85 285.80 A: uh-huh 

286.97 288.93 A: it must be nice to work from home 

288.51 296.37 B: [mn] it is it's ni- i mean it's it's hard to juggle sometimes if i have a huge deadline or a lot or projects going on at one time it 

289.02 290.16 A: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

295.39 296.45 A: uh-huh 

296.43 300.92 B: sometimes i feel overwhelmed because i am limited in the amount of time i can work because 

300.07 301.81 A: exactly that's true 

301.05 303.70 B: i need to spend most of my time with her 

303.00 303.96 A: uh-huh 

303.62 309.38 B: but overall you know i think it's kind of nice it's kind of a good balance and if nothing else it 

306.63 307.94 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

309.29 321.37 B: just keeps me you know involved and active and you know for when i when i do decide to go back to work full time some day or i'd love to just be able to do this full time some day so 

312.98 315.23 A: that's good that's really nice 

317.10 318.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

319.46 323.88 A: that's true [noise] it's a good business that you've started yeah 

322.19 332.78 B: yeah so that's the only bad thing is i don't always feel like i have the time to put in to get more clients and you know do the other things i could do to build the business but 

331.13 333.14 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

332.84 338.67 B: you know i'm trying to just keep it under control right now 'cause i really only wanna work part time right now 

335.78 336.91 A: that's good 

337.63 343.83 A: that's yeah that's true and plus in business you set your own rules so i guess that's that's that's good yeah [laughter] 

341.68 342.79 B: yeah 

342.76 346.66 B: yeah i think you know i think there's good and bad things i think the hard thing too is 

346.61 353.85 B: you know with any business that you start on your own you just you never know when the next job is gonna come or when 

353.78 367.51 B: the next order would come in your case you know so you y- see i've found that it seems to be feast or famine i either have so many projects i can't hardly do them all and then i finish them all and i don't have anything for a month you know and then you start to get worried 

355.73 357.69 A: (( that's true [noise] )) 

362.61 363.44 A: (( mhm )) 

365.33 369.19 A: that's how it is all at least they come all of a sudden otherwise they don't come at all 

368.69 378.73 B: yeah because then you start to get worried and you think okay i need you know i need to get some more business so and everybody i've talked to has their own business seems to run into that 

369.28 369.86 A: (( [noise] )) 

373.18 375.48 A: [laughter] [laughter] that's true 

376.86 380.15 A: so how do you advertise your business do you go on the internet 

379.73 391.42 B: i really i don't do any advertising 'cause it's just word of mouth so far i mean i just work with people i know and then they refer me to other people they know and i've just kind of built it up through referrals but 

381.38 382.47 A: mhm 

383.47 384.40 A: (( mhm )) 

387.49 388.60 A: (( mhm )) 

390.48 398.12 A: [noise] oh okay because that's what i was wondering if you start a business how to reach the masses to let them know you know that i am doing this [noise] 

395.97 409.26 B: yeah and and in you're type of business i think that would be a little different you probably would need to probably do some more advertising just locally in your community you know whether it be a mailer to people's houses or 

399.50 400.46 A: (( mhm )) 

404.40 406.15 A: right mhm 

407.93 412.15 A: right give them free samples and yeah 

409.38 409.99 B: (( um )) 

410.29 413.97 B: yeah you know try to get in um 

414.10 415.84 B: you know i don't know do 

416.06 426.90 B: a bake sale at an event you know sell some of your items at a local event like a fair or something you know i don't know i don't know where you live or what would be in your community but you know if there was something like that you could 

417.89 419.23 A: exactly 

419.73 420.85 A: mhm 

423.75 424.71 A: uh-huh 

426.89 431.78 B: kinda get your face out there and have people try your product so 

428.30 430.71 A: yeah mhm 

430.78 436.12 A: that's true so um how did you start with the publishing business did you come across it [noise] or 

436.01 443.20 B: well it's kind of what i always i was always in public relations and i'd always thought some day it would be nice to work on my own 

438.78 439.92 A: (( mhm )) 

442.54 443.93 A: mhm 

443.26 451.00 B: um so it's kind of what my where my background was um so it just kind of naturally led into that so 

446.67 447.81 A: (( mhm )) 

449.68 453.85 A: [noise] one more interesting thing i i liked is um i like to do taxes 

453.47 454.53 B: (( mhm )) 

453.70 467.32 A: yeah so i thinking you know if you go to like that h&r block thingy and learn from there you know how to make taxes and all you could you know go ahead and make uh fifteen dollars i mean just start with a small fee and then build it up once you become an expert at filling out taxes for people 

463.24 464.16 B: mhm 

467.10 468.05 B: uh-huh 

467.36 470.76 A: during the tax season i mean that's not a bad business to start with too 

470.19 483.48 B: no not if you enjoy it i don't enjoy it [laughter] [laughter] i don't think i would be good at that in fact that's one of the things i'm finding is very complicated when you have your own business is your taxes get very very complicated so 

472.24 474.35 A: you don't enjoy [laughter] 

475.24 476.35 A: [laughter] 

477.64 479.31 A: complicated that's true 

481.40 489.74 A: that's true but if it started word of mouth oh that's person's really good and you know you start with a small fee and you know once you customer then you can start raising the fee 

486.87 487.97 B: yeah 

489.62 494.91 B: oh yeah i mean i would pay somebody to do my taxes [laughter] so that's a good idea 

491.59 499.14 A: exactly [laughter] like i mean around a lot of like these big companies they charge like two hundred dollars for per return or something i mean we can't go that a head 

498.92 511.84 A: but yeah if you they work from home and during the tax season if you have time you know to do a lot of people's returns and make it a business i mean just for the tax season but you could earn pretty good yeah as a side income yeah i mean i i don't know i mean 

500.88 501.95 B: mhm 

503.88 504.75 B: yeah 

505.16 505.72 B: (( [mn] )) 

506.50 509.58 B: oh yeah and that would give you flexibility too 

511.79 518.25 A: i don't money would is not the only pa- object i mean if you do have a lot of money it's like you should put your hand in where you know what to do 

518.48 523.64 A: i mean you start investing in the stock market and stuff and you know that's a little risky thing 

518.48 519.46 B: right 

523.43 524.49 B: yeah 

523.82 525.59 A: yeah so i mean 

524.59 528.30 B: but you gotta do something you enjoy doing too you know 

526.31 534.21 A: that's true you're correct that's right so i mean i don't know i mean there's a lot of wild ideas in my mind but you need a lot of capital for [laughter] them 

533.45 535.38 B: yes that's hard 

534.70 543.38 A: yeah so let's see maybe in the future when when something you know get some cash or something else started as extra money you know 

542.32 555.27 B: yeah that was the one good thing with what i do is i i didn't really need much capital i just need my computer and my internet access and things that i pretty much already had you know i had to i had to buy a fax machine and a couple of other things but 

547.02 548.39 A: that's true 

549.18 550.00 A: mhm 

551.03 552.00 A: uh-huh 

554.10 558.53 A: yeah i guess it it doesn't like but they'll stay with you there's not gonna be like income that's 

557.86 565.95 B: i'm not producing a a tangible product it's more you know my product is what i write so or my plans i develop so 

560.27 561.31 A: mhm 

562.88 564.29 A: exactly 

564.88 568.93 A: that's true that's true so do you go to the publisher and publish your stuff or 

568.49 582.41 B: so no it's not really things that are publi- it's more just working directly with individual companies and organizations so um no so i don't even have to go that route 'cause it's not like fiction where you work through a publisher to get a book it's more you know 

573.07 574.02 A: (( mhm )) 

574.27 575.22 A: (( mhm )) 

578.30 579.16 A: oh 

581.04 582.02 A: uh-huh 

582.40 588.86 B: this hospital might have their own um newsletter that goes out to the community and they want me to write some articles for it 

586.53 587.54 A: mhm 

588.24 590.76 A: oh okay that's that's interesting 

589.03 599.89 B: so i just work directly with them yeah find out what topics they wanna cover and then i do the research on the topics and interview people who would be experts you know 

590.87 592.72 A: mhm oh 

593.71 594.58 A: (( mhm )) 

595.48 597.14 A: (( mhm )) 

598.79 599.89 A: (( [noise] mhm ))
