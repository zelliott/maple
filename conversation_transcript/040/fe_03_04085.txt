95.54 96.61 B: right 

96.74 109.32 A: you know and i thought that was a good way especially for people that work you know to still do it so i think i would you know rent out booth space you know or either just take st- stuff strictly on commission you know something

113.62 119.91 A: but i would give other people the opportunity to to make money too you know not just just myself 

117.59 118.62 B: right 

119.54 127.69 B: have you checked with like other stores and stuff in your area to see if they'd be interested in selling your crafts and your mother's crafts on commission to get you started uh-huh

170.10 172.97 B: no you're going in the hole [laughter] 

171.51 172.94 A: mhm [lipsmack] 

173.20 175.45 A: but how about you what kind would you 

175.77 179.73 B: so oh i think i'd open up a animal pre- reserve 

180.10 181.67 A: mm that'd be neat 

180.63 184.65 B: and a a rescue place for animals 

184.44 185.66 A: yeah 

185.43 194.97 B: so uh i've worked with uh wildlife rescue here in indiana around the forestry and lake munro and all for the last five years and

221.44 223.63 A: mhm yeah 

224.35 235.95 B: doing that i find i can do crafts just like you said i can do crafts at the same time uh i was asking about selling things on consignment with other stores and all because that's what i do here 

236.04 248.93 B: i uh do a lot of nature photography of the animals and stuff that way and make my own cards and things and sell 'em then at the different shops and all around uh lake munro and the forestry 

248.75 250.05 A: oh 

249.47 251.81 B: for them to sell for souvenirs 

251.56 252.75 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

252.06 265.58 B: and uh that was something that [mn] we didn't have anything a- [mn] anyone around here that had postcards or anything of the lake or the forest and all and i started doing it and started getting a lot of the animal pictures and stuff in 

265.69 267.17 A: oh 

266.18 267.40 B: and uh 

267.87 270.81 A: [lipsmack] i know uh have you ever heard of realfoot lake 

270.80 271.92 B: yeah

293.01 305.22 B: so it goes pretty good there and so people don't have to drive way out of their way to try and find a souvenir shop [laughter] they can go to a little bait and tackle store and find things [laughter]

432.33 434.27 A: (( mhm yeah [noise] [noise] ))
