0.26 3.05 A: [mn] hi this is nerang vengatayson 

2.50 5.76 B: [mn] hi this is linda i'm in texas where are you 

5.62 7.65 A: i'm in texas as well in austin 

7.30 12.26 B: oh i'm in austin also how interesting would you like to start first or would you like me to 

9.60 10.70 A: [laughter] 

12.23 18.22 A: ah you can go ahead [noise] um actually i'm wondering what the definition of perjury is that they're going for 

17.70 29.59 B: well that's interesting um i don't know i was thinking in a more of a legal definition like in a court situation but i guess we could go as far as just lying to protect your friends and family if you'd like to [laughter] go that direction 

29.27 32.33 A: (( [noise] okay sounds good [noise] do you want to go ahead and start and i'll )) 

31.35 45.21 B: okay would i commit perjury to um protect a close friend or family member no i wouldn't i i love my family and i love my friends very much but unfortunately or fortunately i'm very law abiding 

45.01 58.60 B: and there is no way that i would lie in court to protect someone now would i tell a little white lie to protect someone's feelings probably if someone asked me if they were fat i mean that's that's a pretty 

58.50 64.40 B: pretty limited um definition but i would go that far but not legally how about you 

60.18 61.95 A: (( right yeah )) 

64.39 67.18 A: ah i think mostly i th- i would not 

67.17 81.23 A: just because i think it it's best to ah stay truthful in everything i think that goes along with with my beliefs just to be true be moral in everything but i think however if the if the situation did come up where i may have to like 

81.12 90.59 A: that would affect ah possibly the life of family members like whether they would die because of it then it is then it is possible that i would say a lie just to protect them 

90.01 99.62 B: okay give me an example what if they committed a serious crime like killed someone and you were able to say they didn't do it would you go that far 

99.14 106.57 A: [noise] well if if they had actually like s- killed someone i think that they deserve to pay the time for ah pay the time in jail 

106.42 120.60 A: or i i don't think that they should deserve to die for that but i do think like f- like for example if i know something if their intention was not to be how it turned out then i think i might lie to protect them like for example if 

120.46 133.17 A: i i don't know on a s- on a simpler basis say they were there it was an exam and they they weren't they didn't mean to be cheating they were just happen to like [mn] be you know taking a like they just looked up and all of a sudden they someone who someone was walking away and and they saw the answers 

132.95 135.79 A: and they just happened to circle it but they weren't really going for it 

135.67 144.75 A: then i may i may say okay they weren't really trying to do it then if they don't caught i'm not gonna l- like even if they even if somehow they say oh a few answers are the same 

144.60 151.15 A: i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say oh they must have cheated i'll lie and say i'll give them the benefit of the doubt by lying and saying oh he didn't cheat 

150.93 158.93 B: okay i can i can sort of agree with that i also think if they didn't do something and if we go back to that legal situation and 

155.95 157.00 A: (( mm )) 

158.22 159.43 A: right 

158.69 171.03 B: they didn't commit a crime but yet if i don't lie it'll make it look like they did i could be doing it i i might give someone an alibi when i know they didn't do what they were accused of [mn] 

160.39 161.44 A: (( mm )) 

164.50 165.33 A: uh-huh 

165.71 166.84 A: (( definitely )) 

171.27 173.58 A: right if the alibi didn't happen 

171.76 176.82 B: because it's the only way they're going to to be able to get off so i can see doing that also 

174.80 175.72 A: right 

176.36 188.96 A: i i yeah in only the few circumstances but i- in an outright sense where i know exactly that they committed something or they did something wrong i think that even if they are family they should pay the price i'll feel sorry for them but i think they deserve to 

188.78 193.94 A: you know m- take the time i'm not gonna like lie for them to protect them situation 

192.40 197.14 B: well i agree with that so and and i don't know i have children do you have children 

196.46 198.94 A: [mn] no i'm i'm a college student right now 

198.38 204.50 B: okay so you would be talking about your parents and i think it's a little different situation when you have children 

201.53 202.50 A: yeah 

204.31 216.16 B: [mn] but i do know people who've been put in that situation by college aged students where they had perhaps been drinking and then there'd been an accident they'll say their their student didn't drink 

204.52 205.41 A: mhm 

210.52 211.43 A: uh-huh 

212.78 213.58 A: right 

215.92 216.93 A: uh-huh 

215.98 227.08 B: [mn] i'm not sure how protective that is and i don't know if you've or any of your friends have ever been in that situation i'm not sure that's good for the person for you to lie for them in that case 

222.06 223.05 A: uh-huh 

224.66 225.46 A: right 

225.98 226.82 A: mhm 

228.24 239.51 A: well i would i would for me i think like personally like i i drink rarely myself and if i do it- it's on very few occasions and it's only because like i'm at a friend's place and i know i'll be crashing the night there 

239.16 240.15 B: right 

239.46 253.41 A: but i [mn] personally if if you did take the time to drink and you end up driving and you cause an accident then i think that's one of the occasions where there should be no lie like it was your own fault how much you [noise] drink and you should have to pay the price for that 

252.85 261.12 B: [noise] [mn] well i agree with that also um what other what other strange situations can we come up with i can't think of anything right now my brain must be 

253.57 254.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

259.43 270.25 A: i know i'm i'm tr- i'm trying to think like of a you know a situation that like would present itself where you may [noise] have to be forced to say even a small lie just to protect to an extent 

269.67 270.79 B: right 

270.38 281.94 A: i think we've pretty much covered ah pretty good topics about like you know in case that they needed an alibi that's a that's a good one or in case they're in a you know a life or death situation and they they have to have a lie 'cause they can't protect themselves any other way 

281.81 282.86 B: right 

282.40 283.66 A: but 

283.06 287.52 B: but i think a lot of people would go farther just to protect th- a- 

287.59 296.25 B: [mn] fr- i see it among friends in young people [mn] to perhaps make them look better in the eyes of their parents [mn] um 

289.84 291.15 A: mhm 

294.91 296.09 A: (( mhm right )) 

296.20 301.73 B: will lie about their friends [mn] and i remember seeing this when my kids were like in junior high 

298.05 298.78 A: (( right )) 

301.54 302.46 A: uh-huh 

301.57 315.70 B: [mn] they would say oh so and so wouldn't do that even if i know so and so had done that because they wanted me to think their friends well to allow them to see their friends i think is part of it you don't want to lose that that closeness with your friends 

307.54 308.27 A: yeah 

312.13 313.32 A: (( right [noise] )) 

315.05 320.86 A: yeah that that that's a that's a big thing but i don't know i- in my position whenever i have like 

320.67 332.54 A: said something like oh this guy won't do it it's it's usually more in a sense of like in his moral beliefs like if it co- like if it comes down to oh would this guy do some a c- a crime or would he commit something like that 

332.45 338.76 A: i would say oh no i don't think he would but usually when it comes to i think like oh would this guy drink or would this guy do something like that 

338.52 349.07 A: most often like within friends y- you you don't you don't lie about it but sometimes if you know that their parent would be a l- a little against it then you tend to say like oh yeah i've never seen him drink or something like that 

348.28 354.93 B: that's right yeah i understand that too yeah [mn] ah i think it's just it's a matter of um 

355.82 366.68 B: [mn] protecting others' feelings more than anything else but i can't even envision a life or death situation i guess since i've never been in one maybe it would be a different situation 

359.04 361.09 A: (( yeah i- )) 

364.36 365.11 A: (( i- it's )) 

366.60 377.12 A: yeah i- i don't know it- it's difficult to it's difficult to come up with a proposition i gu- i can only think that it it could happen i- i'm not able to come up with an actual situation where you would be forced to 

376.91 383.64 A: have something like that come up i don't know i'm trying to think like you and maybe in like a movie or something another example 

383.45 385.64 A: of something something would be similar to that 

385.65 398.86 A: ah the only thing i can think of is is even if the person if the person had a alibi and they couldn't give it because of they had their own personal reasons but perhaps they could tell you and then you could just lie and make another alibi or make up a lie to protect them but 

395.98 397.11 B: right 

398.19 404.61 B: that's the classic movie situation where there's been an affair and you don't want to admit that to someone else though [laughter] 

400.31 401.25 A: yeah 

402.48 413.96 A: or something yeah someone did something that like [noise] even if it's even if it's not bad a harm to anyone else they did something on their own and you don't want to you know open it up so you just make up a lie and give them something else 

413.67 414.51 B: sure 

413.85 421.33 A: but on their own i'm t- i'm trying to think what could be what could make something like that it's pretty difficult 

420.18 420.93 B: (( [mn] )) 

421.05 432.77 B: yeah i'm not sure and i i don't know what causes people to commit if we go back to that legal definition because we've really stalled on this if we were in court and there were were someone in our family who had 

426.37 427.31 A: yeah 

427.80 430.31 A: (( mm mhm mm )) 

432.84 434.32 B: possibly 

434.14 446.20 B: been responsible for for a situation that's happened we'll we won't say he killed someone but there's a serious situation that this person does face jail time for and you're not sure whether they did it or not 

443.63 444.28 A: uh-huh 

446.01 456.18 B: [mn] but you know that if you say he was home with me that night that he'll get off [mn] you're pretty sure he wouldn't do it but you're not really sure now would you lie 

451.69 452.70 A: yeah 

454.90 456.16 A: (( yeah if )) 

456.37 457.67 A: (( i i i think )) 

457.54 471.71 A: i think first i would i would definitely have to talk to him first because i i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to jeopardize my my honesty and like my truthfulness like how people view me and my word i wouldn't want to jeopardize that by immediately jumping out and saying that it didn't happen 

471.48 483.66 A: like like my friends are my friends and and i figure i've i know them pretty well but there are times when like friends or even i make i may do something that like another friend might be like wow i never thought nerang would do that 

483.52 484.63 A: (( like i mean )) 

484.41 492.80 A: [mn] like even for a simple example like before i came up here m- um all my friends were like oh nerang would never join a fraternity and now i find myself joi- in a fraternity 

492.61 499.75 A: so i mean just like something simple like that i would definitely want to go t- like i've seen it happen myself so i would definitely want to take the time to 

499.52 512.56 A: go talk t- to my friend and see you know can you explain like whether you were doing something or why would you have done it like if if i if i knew that they probably had no intent to want to hurt someone else and they were in that position 

512.32 518.68 A: then perhaps i would be i would be moved to more to saying oh yeah he was with me and and i would lie 

518.48 531.95 A: but if i possibly even thought that he had some you know had some like brush up or maybe a possible fight could have occurred previously or he had something he'd been wronged by that person then i would definitely go ask him you know did you make did you try and like you know 

531.79 538.93 A: take your anger out because of what he did earlier or what she did earlier to do that and now y- you did this you know i would definitely want to check with them and see 

538.70 549.82 B: yeah and i think there again it comes to if you trust the people that you're close to if you trust your friends or your family members you will trust them to tell you the truth so you don't have to if you lie for them it's not 

543.13 543.99 A: yeah 

546.64 547.69 A: definitely 

549.61 554.22 B: [mn] it's a little different than saying no he didn't do it you're just giving him 

552.61 553.49 A: right 

554.67 558.82 B: [sigh] sort of an alibi i guess we're back to that situation again 

556.86 557.67 A: yeah 

558.43 565.55 A: giving them the a little help b- just because you know that they'd be honest enough to tell you w- if they'd committed something like that or not 

564.85 565.98 B: right 

566.00 580.14 B: [mn] i actually that sort of reminded me of a situation that my brother found himself in with a b- a young man that lived across the street from them was sort of close to his children when they were in high school had gone to a bar one night had started a fight 

573.90 574.76 A: uh-huh 

579.91 581.18 B: and the 

580.04 581.04 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [mn] )) 

581.26 588.52 B: he'd started the fight but the other guy obviously was involved in it too the other young man ended up dying he hit his head on something and 

587.52 588.68 A: oh wow 

588.36 598.33 B: several months later i mean he was in a coma for a long time [mn] so the question was how far would they have gone to protect that boy and they would've gone you know to the moon 

591.74 592.64 A: uh-huh 

598.35 599.90 B: to protect him and my 

598.37 599.50 A: right
