0.00 2.00 A: (( [noise] how's it going )) 

0.29 1.40 B: hello 

1.74 2.96 B: hi i'm dan ah 

2.94 5.37 A: i'm brett [mn] [noise] where you from [noise] 

4.82 7.59 B: i'm in washington d._c. what about yourself 

7.47 9.13 A: brooklyn new york 

9.80 10.89 B: (( okay okay so )) 

10.16 11.07 A: so would 

11.12 12.44 A: would you ah 

12.55 14.45 A: commit perjury for a family member 

15.07 20.92 B: probably yes um it kind of i mean obviously it depends on the context of the crime if it was ah 

16.78 17.67 A: [noise] 

21.06 23.63 B: you know something just small like shoplifting where they 

23.64 28.78 B: you know the punishment wouldn't be too harsh and they were in the wrong i might not be so [mn] 

29.47 34.80 B: easy to do it but if it's a [mn] i don't know a murder charge or something you know i i have i think i 

29.54 30.59 A: (( right )) 

33.93 37.41 A: wait so if they do something worse you're more willing to do it [noise] 

36.80 48.52 B: i i think so you know it sounds weird as i'm saying it but think of the consequences you know your family a family member going to jail for the rest of their life versus ah you know paying a hundred dollar fine or something 

48.23 53.19 A: [noise] right right but i mean they killed someone shouldn't they be punished for it even if they are a family member [mn] [mn] 

54.17 56.98 B: yeah but that's i'm i'm not going to be the one that put them there 

58.16 63.68 A: well i mean somebody has to i mean so you're saying they should get off scot free and go unpunished for their crime 

65.44 74.79 B: [mn] in the broader sense of course not but if you are sitting in a court room [mn] and knowing you're the one who's going to be responsible for putting your father or sister or mother behind jail 

70.46 71.22 A: right 

74.63 87.60 B: for the rest of her life like that's that's an unheard of burden i think i don't think it's something you can really appreciate 'til it's actually happening to you i guess ah i guess a p- a point that i'm thinking about as i as i say that is that [mn] 

80.97 82.00 A: that's true 

87.87 95.95 B: you know i circumstantial if there if there was some sort of may- if we're talking about murder if there was a a self defense cause that you know 

89.39 90.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

95.94 103.79 B: you you you believe to be true even if the prosecution isn't going for it you know you might feel that it's your obligation to your family 

102.54 113.82 A: right [noise] right but i mean i'm i'm ta- like in a situation where it's clearly they've committed the crime they did it willfully and then suddenly they want to get out of the situation like how [mn] 

104.23 105.13 B: ah 

112.28 117.03 B: [mn] yeah yeah i do think personal responsibility is is needed so 

117.22 122.61 B: [mn] yeah i guess i wouldn't be as willing in that situation [mn] i- i- i'll i'll retreat a little on what i said immediately [mn] 

122.50 124.05 A: [laughter] 

123.62 127.96 B: [laughter] wh- what about what about you have you ever been in a situation like that even if it wasn't perjury you've 

124.35 129.62 A: (( [noise] [noise] um )) 

129.54 131.17 B: got a lie to cover someone 

129.88 136.09 A: ah not not real- i mean like when i went to school there were various 

136.22 142.04 A: fraternity things where we had to present statements that were not entirely true so 

142.21 147.09 A: our fraternity wouldn't get in trouble but i don't think it was legally perjury [mn] but ah 

147.76 154.63 A: well you know i mean yeah i definitely have very flexible morals i definitely you know i look out for those people that are closest to me and so 

154.71 159.04 A: in a situation where yeah if somebody's going to be in serious trouble i think i'd probably do it 

159.12 160.76 B: you'd probably commit perjury 

160.46 163.25 A: yeah yeah sure i mean 

163.35 172.19 A: i don't know i i think you know you look at it from a purely like [noise] you know break down the situation standpoint you say well what are the chances of me getting caught you know 

171.07 173.26 B: [mn] yeah i mean tha- that- that's a 

173.34 180.26 B: ah i'd say a big factor because my guess would be you know ninety percent of perjurers don't get caught 

180.08 181.99 A: right 

180.28 193.12 B: because they're only perjuring themselves on something they know that can't be proven otherwise like sure i can say so and so was with me at eight o'clock because i know there's no way to prove it otherwise even if they weren't with me 'til nine o'clock or you know whatever the case is i watch a lot of ah law and order on t._v. so 

184.37 185.19 A: right 

192.64 193.90 A: [laughter] 

192.93 195.52 B: [laughter] that's where most of my opinions are coming from [mn] 

194.88 196.42 A: [laughter] right 

196.43 207.39 A: right so i mean but all i mean you know would you be able to live with yourself afterwards you've just gotten your brother or sister whatever like off a murder rap right and you know she murdered someone 

207.86 208.77 A: you know 

209.02 209.92 A: (( i mean )) 

210.10 219.43 A: [mn] i guess there's there's like the analytical standpoint well i'm gonna get away with this and this person's very close to me and i want them out of jail but then can you live with the guilt afterwards you know what i'm saying 

218.98 225.63 B: mhm [mn] well i mean the worse guil- yeah the worse guilt though is that can i can you live with the fact that you're responsible for them being in jail 

225.76 226.72 A: that's true 

226.82 228.62 B: [laughter] i mean i [noise] 

227.57 229.96 A: but you're not responsible you didn't commit the crime 

231.09 237.55 A: you know and they're ultimately the ones that the one that's responsible you could've like sprung 'em out 

238.28 239.21 A: but 

239.73 246.33 A: you know i mean i mean really who the blame doesn't fall on you it's not like you murdered someone 

244.03 244.94 B: [noise] 

245.95 260.28 B: right but i mean it just really to two situations i can think of one is say you're brother got in a bar fight and killed someone you know heated emotions situation gone awry but he's clearly in the wrong 

255.94 256.73 A: right 

260.25 273.10 B: the other one is say you're sister is in abusive relationship and one day she fights back and throws a vase at the guy and he hits his head and and dies you know wouldn't you rather 

271.63 272.50 A: right 

273.45 279.54 B: d- can't you see where there's situations where it would be more acceptable [mn] morally to cover 

279.90 281.53 B: (( for your sister or your brother )) 

281.71 293.11 A: yeah i mean yeah but i mean the law's going to take that into account too it's not like she's gonna get you know she'll probably get some kind of either self defense plea or you know probation suspended sentence 

290.58 291.57 B: one would hope 

292.35 296.98 B: right but i mean there are i would assume there are situations where 

295.90 299.45 A: i mean abusive relationship or not she's ended somebody's life 

299.49 301.51 A: their life is over 

301.77 302.71 A: you know 

303.28 304.46 A: i mean 

306.25 312.04 A: ta- well actually so would you i guess you would perjure yourself too if you were in that situation right 

312.06 315.05 A: say you've committed murder and you were trying to get out 

315.18 316.74 B: yeah i mean 

315.39 316.54 A: right 

316.91 321.16 A: and you'd clearly come up with an alibi you're doing anything you're looking out for number one right 

320.45 322.96 B: right i mean i- isn't that what everyone's really doing 

322.97 323.88 A: yeah 

323.41 325.23 B: i mean otherwise 

325.33 338.15 B: ideally people everyone who pleads guilty would be guilty and everyone who pleads not guilty would actually be innocent but that's obviously not the case since people plead not guilty and are eventually convicted so people are always looking out for themselves they're not willing to take responsibility for their actions 

334.03 334.92 A: right 

338.15 344.50 A: right so but ah so how far does it extend like a close friend would you commit perjury for him 

344.30 345.18 B: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

346.85 347.74 A: like 

347.15 356.03 B: you know i of course there's there's no yes or no answer [laughter] you know i i would like to think that i would not commit perjury for a friend on a murder rap um 

356.82 361.21 B: unless i thought there was some sort of situation that was inline 

361.25 367.69 B: that was going that somehow justified it that only i could i had the burden of pr- of compensating for that 

367.15 373.64 A: so you're basically saying though y- you don't trust the law [noise] to determine what's just or whether or not 

374.07 377.12 A: you know ah a murder a crime is justified 

374.89 378.02 B: y- i i i'm on- i'm scared to put it to a risk 

378.39 379.20 A: (( what )) 

378.73 382.53 B: i would be i would be scared to put it to that risk 

382.63 386.81 B: you know i i i do like to have trust in the law and that eventually the right things are going to happen 

382.96 383.70 A: right 

387.25 396.95 B: but i mean there have been checkered incidents in history and you know whoever my friend or my brother is in this case [laughter] may not be the most significant case ever but [mn] 

396.90 407.17 B: i- i- it's it- it's gonna be a huge risk weighing down on you and probably in the end i would after con- i would probably ah stay on the truth 

407.36 411.52 B: or try to avoid having to say anything on the matter [laughter] 

407.66 408.47 A: so 

411.36 412.34 A: right 

412.35 413.31 A: right 

413.12 422.83 B: i mean would you what if [mn] what if your brother came into your apartment one night and said i just killed someone on the street i mean would you run to the police right away and call 'em in 

422.89 425.12 A: no obviously not right 

424.58 428.58 B: [mn] yeah i mean isn't isn't this just that's just the one variation i 

427.40 439.78 A: but that's that's not per- that's not directly breaking the law i guess it's aiding and abetting maybe but [noise] but i mean you know you first you discuss oh my god what are we gonna do blah blah blah like 

432.10 433.43 B: think it is yeah 

437.70 438.70 B: right 

440.33 444.01 A: and then figure it i mean you probably try to 

444.14 450.86 A: either he has to turn himself in or figure out a way to get out of it it's not like you're gonna run and call the police and be like come get my brother 

450.32 456.02 B: right i mean it's just a sort of a a different variation on the same question of moral obligation [lipsmack] 

455.59 461.04 A: right but so i- in a lesser crime you would be less likely to perjure you think 

461.43 462.60 B: yes 

462.81 463.56 A: why 

463.99 467.24 A: go on a hundred dollars life in prison it's pretty much the same right 

466.59 469.45 B: (( [mn] i don't know if i'm gonna give you that [laughter] [laughter] do )) 

468.60 469.22 A: (( [laughter] )) 

471.47 472.58 A: well i mean 

473.02 481.75 A: is is if you perjure in like a murder case is that a more punishable offence than perjuring in like a shoplifting case do you know 

481.20 483.32 B: you mean by law is it i have no idea 

483.14 484.87 A: (( yeah 'cause )) 

483.76 494.57 B: um i mean i would guess there's probably i don't know if there's such a thing as like first degree second degree perjury [noise] or if there's just sort of different penalties they can impose you you know maybe you can get a fine maybe you could go to a jail for a year 

494.66 495.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

494.97 496.34 A: right 

495.71 497.03 B: (( [mn] so )) 

497.48 498.21 A: mm 

497.52 498.46 B: (( i don't know )) 

498.91 503.51 A: hm ah did you ever see the movie sleepers 

501.14 501.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

503.65 510.04 B: yeah with the kids right what was what was the case in that i i mean i saw it when it came out years ago 

505.45 507.01 A: yeah and the 

508.17 512.98 A: i it was the kids had been like sexually abused by this the 

513.25 514.91 B: by the prison guards 

513.38 514.31 A: their 

514.56 521.82 A: juvenile detention prison guards or whatever and then so they murdered him 'cause they saw him in some restaurant and then 

522.16 526.46 A: their other friend who had also been sexually abused by him basically set it up to 

526.88 530.64 B: yeah yeah but that was that's a little far fetched when he was a lawyer right 

527.09 528.65 A: [noise] to like get them off 

530.09 534.69 A: right right but then his final his final thing was he got the priest 

535.05 540.20 A: to ah perjure for them to say that they were at a basketball game with him 

539.26 541.75 B: [laughter] really i i don't remember that but [laughter] 

542.95 548.65 B: i mean but that- that's a case that most people considered somewhat justifiable murder you know 

548.95 558.36 A: [noise] yeah but what is justifiable murder what do you mean there's no such thing as justifiable murder ending somebody's life their life is over you don't have the right to take that into your hands 

558.10 563.38 B: well but what about the fact that this guy was a monster and abusing fourteen year olds he was supposed to be in charge of [lipsmack] 

563.58 564.15 A: (( [noise] )) 

564.84 572.44 A: well i mean so he should be punished for that but he shouldn't be murdered it's not like if he got arrested and sent to prison for that he'd be given the electric chair 

572.43 573.48 B: that's true 

572.56 573.51 A: you know 

573.77 577.42 A: i mean he'd spend what like maybe years in prison or something 

577.87 579.03 B: are you a lawyer [laughter] 

579.68 580.62 A: (( what )) 

580.03 581.20 B: are you a lawyer [laughter] 

580.88 584.18 A: no no i'm not i'm a writer [noise] actually 

583.80 585.12 B: oh me too [laughter] [mn] 

585.17 585.89 A: are you 

586.23 586.92 A: [noise] 

586.89 588.01 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

587.87 589.04 A: (( what do you ah )) 

589.08 598.37 B: i work ah i work on i just left from a magazine to more like a business communications newsletter type thing but overall i consider myself a writer what about you 

595.21 595.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

595.98 597.01 A: oh okay 

598.50 599.95 A: [noise] ah fiction
