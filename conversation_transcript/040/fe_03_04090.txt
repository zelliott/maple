1.35 4.43 A: [noise] [lipsmack] i'm debbie from illinois [noise] 

4.08 6.69 B: hi i'm patty from minnesota 

9.22 10.51 A: [laughter] 

9.25 12.18 B: now the topic is a business now correct 

11.74 14.07 A: uh yeah we're supposed to 

12.68 13.94 B: yeah 

14.21 18.92 A: discuss a hypothetical situation if money wasn't an object 

17.17 22.54 B: yeah well i already have [laughter] i have two businesses i would love it if money wasn't a matter 

22.71 23.83 B: um [laughter] 

23.89 29.40 B: and i suppose with the i do have a s- a salon and day spa business right now and a daycare business [lipsmack] 

29.30 31.95 A: [mn] oh daycare i don't think i could do that 

31.32 42.80 B: yeah [laughter] and the money isn't an issue for that i i think the salon and day spa business the money's an issue because it's so much overhead and we haven't been open real long so we'd probably expand on that if money wasn't an issue 

42.75 47.83 B: um but i do think owning two businesses now i can't think of another one that i'd wanna start 

47.39 49.11 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

48.20 49.10 B: do you have a 

49.88 51.70 A: [mn] i don't know what i'd want to start 

53.79 57.37 B: you can't think of anything that would sound intriguing [lipsmack] that 

58.59 59.72 A: mm 

59.78 62.47 A: growing flowers how's that 

61.45 62.47 B: (( sounds fun )) 

62.79 64.95 A: yeah i like flowers 

64.64 67.27 B: you'd just set up a greenhouse or something to get it going 

67.40 71.12 A: oh yeah you'd have to have a greenhouse and then all kinds of the plant 

71.94 74.51 A: that'd be really expensive [laughter] 

74.05 76.83 B: yeah a greenhouse would be to set it up 

75.79 77.96 A: fortunately money's not an option huh 

77.49 80.26 B: yeah it isn't an option so you could do that if you wanted to 

80.20 82.36 A: [laughter] yeah 'cause the ones from like 

82.38 85.72 A: tulips from like holland and stuff are really expensive 

85.54 93.52 B: yeah i don't grow things not even in my house i don't have the time to keep track of the watering of them and they end up dying so i don't even b- bother starting 

89.13 90.47 A: [noise] 

93.46 95.67 A: oh i like growing stuff 

94.98 104.13 B: yeah if i were to do it again though i think um if i started another business my kids are twelve and thirteen i'd probably start something that would involve them that they would be interested in 

103.88 104.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

104.68 110.94 A: [noise] yeah mine are oh let me see i've a nephew that lives with me he's like fifteen gonna be sixteen 

111.10 117.64 A: i've a fifteen year old one gonna be fourteen next month one gonna be twelve next month and a girl who be 

118.47 119.73 A: she's just ten 

119.36 133.96 B: [noise] oh so you're busy i think my kids my kids are starting to get interested in business and stuff at school and they do different projects at school as business owners and what they would do so i think it would be fun to start something that they would be interested in if money wasn't an object something that would be a learning experience for 

120.97 122.13 A: (( oh yeah [noise] )) 

134.07 135.60 B: [lipsmack] for kids 

135.85 138.28 A: yeah my my two girls 

137.84 138.40 B: (( [noise] )) 

138.82 142.41 A: they think it's kind of fun watching it start from nothing and then growing 

142.24 143.86 B: oh exactly that would be fun 

144.12 144.70 A: (( [cough] )) 

145.11 147.04 A: yeah they love doing that kind of thing 

147.61 149.09 A: [noise] some of them anyway 

147.66 151.04 B: [noise] yeah they and they could help with it too which would be nice 

150.75 152.68 A: yeah it's something they could get into 

152.54 158.78 B: and you could do it some you could do it if you had a big enough yard you could do it at home [noise] so you could work from home [noise] which would really be a bonus 

158.05 161.92 A: oh yeah yeah actually i have a pretty big yard so 

161.90 163.36 B: (( [noise] )) 

163.06 166.37 A: and flowers huh they don't take up all that much space 

166.27 167.98 B: [noise] [laughter] no they don't 

167.60 169.36 A: [laughter] 

168.30 173.97 B: no if you had a greenhouse you could probably do a lot with different seasons because you probably you're a little bit 

174.04 178.43 B: longer s- growing season than we have in minnesota but probably not too much longer 

178.36 180.36 A: not too much longer here 

180.09 184.06 B: yeah and if you didn't have a greenhouse you wouldn't be able to do it you'd have such a short time 

181.60 182.34 A: (( [cough] )) 

184.04 187.45 A: [noise] yeah well i have a basement too 

185.99 186.86 B: (( 'cause it )) 

187.31 188.78 B: [lipsmack] yeah that would help 

187.89 189.58 A: you could put lighting in there 

189.46 192.60 B: yes [noise] 'cause we haven't gotten [noise] anything in 

190.34 191.61 A: (( that's all you need )) 

192.81 196.71 B: [noise] we haven't gotten anything in our ground yet [noise] 

195.42 200.40 A: [laughter] i've got just a few things i've got a garden that my dad's already started 

199.78 207.72 B: oh yes it's been [noise] it took so long to get warm and now it's freezing cold it's been so much rain we wouldn't be able to plant anything and 

200.99 201.91 A: (( [cough] )) 

207.23 209.01 A: yeah 

207.89 212.40 B: that would be a hard business to start because you're so dependent on the weather without something to cover it 

212.37 218.51 A: [noise] yeah but if money's not an option you don't really have to worry about that [laughter] 

215.81 217.90 B: [lipsmack] well exactly that'd be wonderful 

218.24 227.91 B: yeah if the money wasn't an option i would probably expand my salon business a little bit and pay off some of the overheads so i wouldn't have to worry about it and 

227.26 230.72 A: yeah you'd just do what more tanning beds and 

229.49 238.61 B: well we don't do the tanning beds but we'd probably expand um the nail area put in more pedicure spas and stuff that seems to do the busiest in the summer 

231.05 231.82 A: no 

238.78 242.25 B: and that's that's the area we have to turn customers away right now 

238.91 240.76 A: yeah 

242.05 242.94 A: ooh 

243.34 246.14 B: and that's hard to do [laughter] 

244.76 247.21 A: yeah you might wanna hire more personnel 

246.76 253.17 B: well it's not it's not the personnel that's the problem it's if you have to a you have to have the space to do it yeah and 

250.12 251.46 A: space 

251.55 253.42 A: (( yeah )) 

253.52 256.98 A: i don't know i'd think it would be kind of hard to find somebody to do your 

253.65 254.43 B: we don- 

255.73 257.75 B: (( [sigh] )) 

257.25 258.93 A: that'd be good enough you know 

258.73 265.06 B: yeah we don't have problems with that it's just that the pedicure stations because they're a little whirlpool station and the big chair 

265.31 267.83 B: takes up a lot of space to put those in 

267.97 268.97 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

268.19 275.36 B: and realistically you're not getting for the rent that you pay you're not and the exp- cost of the chairs you're not getting the revenue back in for that 

275.18 276.82 A: (( [noise] yeah [mn] )) 

276.07 279.16 B: you make a lot more money with the hair stylists 

279.87 282.03 B: in the same amount of space 

281.28 283.65 A: you could always expand and put tanning beds in 

283.82 294.53 B: [lipsmack] well we haven't done that they are popular but we've got some in the area that are that are j- strictly tanning that's what they do and the insurance on those is so high 

285.21 287.31 A: those are pretty popular [laughter] 

294.95 296.57 A: yeah but if you kinda 

296.76 299.30 A: a lot of them like the one stop shop thing though 

299.79 301.15 B: right that's true 

301.04 304.13 A: you do the tanning get your hair done your nails all at one time 

303.06 310.11 B: [mn] yeah but see we do um skincare and massage and stuff and we teach the whole health and you can't really 

304.89 305.47 A: (( [cough] )) 

310.10 320.52 B: teach people to use good products on their skin and take good care of their skin and then have a tanning bed in the same place yeah exactly it's a real contradiction of what we're trying to teach people to do for their skin [laughter] 

314.11 316.02 A: and then go tan [laughter] 

319.82 324.06 A: yeah i don't tan so my sister tans but one of 'em anyway 

321.70 322.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

324.46 326.28 A: i never tan [mn] 

325.72 329.21 B: yeah it's a good money making business that'd probably be a good one to start 

329.64 331.94 A: yeah i don't usually have enough time to even 

332.49 335.01 A: see myself let alone go tanning [noise] 

336.70 338.56 A: running around all the time 

337.03 342.33 B: yeah [lipsmack] yeah i [mn] i rarely go tanning unless it's before a vacation or something and i don't wanna burn 

342.52 344.09 B: to a crisp 

342.63 345.30 A: yeah see if if you grow flowers mainly 

345.72 347.22 A: little fertilizer 

347.47 349.45 A: they pretty much do the job 

349.21 351.11 B: right exactly 

350.33 354.03 A: doesn't take time not much of it [noise] 

353.49 355.75 B: well and if you're doing it in the greenhouse you're not weeding 

356.71 359.70 A: yeah because yeah well 

359.81 365.08 A: i don't know i think you kinda have to have more than one greenhouse because you wouldn't want cross pollination going on 

365.12 371.80 B: oh that's true or separate rooms with like the plastic dividers i've seen those too with the plastic curtains that kinda keep things separate 

367.89 368.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

371.48 375.84 A: yeah 'cause i don't think i'd want cross pollination between certain things 

376.68 380.24 A: i mean if you were growing like white tulips you don't wanna end up with 

380.29 381.85 A: yellow ones 

381.41 382.57 B: no that's true 

382.02 383.98 A: [laughter] 

382.95 388.73 B: and somebody who doesn't grow flowers like me wouldn't consider wouldn't even think of it [laughter] as being an issue 

388.83 391.84 A: hey i remember a little bit from my uh 

391.62 394.05 B: horticulture yeah [laughter] 

391.88 395.23 A: biology class [laughter] 

394.38 397.25 B: yeah i took a little bit in high school too but not enough where 

397.63 399.31 B: [noise] i've used it at all 

399.40 401.72 A: i had one in college 

403.26 406.92 A: [noise] but i only went to college for a couple of years didn't even get a degree so 

406.66 410.88 B: oh [laughter] you may have to go back if you're gonna start your own horticulture your own 

407.45 410.15 A: [laughter] 

411.12 412.38 B: flower business 

412.17 413.98 A: oh yeah and that class is 

412.86 416.96 B: go back and take a f- take a couple of courses and learn a few more things 

416.86 418.18 A: (( oh i remember )) 

418.26 422.05 A: i uh knew some people in that class and that was kind of brutal [mn] 

422.00 423.21 B: [laughter] 

422.21 425.55 A: you had to know all the names and the scientific and everything 

425.41 426.60 B: wow 

426.73 428.82 A: that was really rough 

429.22 430.67 A: i remember that one 

431.98 436.60 B: [noise] [lipsmack] yeah that makes it difficult when you're starting a business you need you need a lot of education 

437.01 441.68 B: you need to know exactly what you're doing and what you're getting yourself into and sometimes you 

440.41 441.59 A: yeah you need a 

441.85 444.56 B: even a well planned adventure 

444.69 446.76 B: you get you're in for a few surprises 

446.70 449.41 A: well you need a good background in what you're gonna do 

449.03 453.59 B: yes yeah and you need a lot of funding so boy if money weren't an object that'd be a great thing 

453.79 458.95 A: yeah i'd probably know enough about flowers to grow them and do all right at it 

461.13 462.56 A: it wouldn't be too bad 

462.11 468.73 B: yeah especially if you don't have worry about losing money right off the bat until you can start making something that'd be real- that'd be the ideal way to open a business 

468.86 473.15 B: just to have to have the proper funding so you're not constantly putting money into it 

468.99 470.73 A: yeah you'd probably 

472.98 476.89 A: yeah you'd have to really though start finding a customer though 

477.39 479.60 A: you know like flower shops and 

478.99 480.40 B: oh yeah you'd have to 

479.72 486.31 A: or the bigger chains before like way before because they're only so long you know at perfect 

486.07 493.43 B: right yep and if you can't market your product then you don't have it doesn't matter how good you are at it if you can't get it out there and can't sell it [lipsmack] 

492.92 494.16 A: yeah 

494.29 497.78 A: and they're only a they got a peak point there so 

497.75 505.58 B: right you see these little guys with their car set up on the corner selling you know proteuson flowers or what not but i don't know how much they can possibly sell to make it worth it 

506.18 509.20 A: unless it's just like a part time hobby kind of thing 

508.70 509.98 B: right 

510.63 512.22 A: and a lot of them are 

512.69 518.73 A: a lot of them are like farmers and all that so that's not their you know their full time job 

518.66 521.77 B: right they're just making a little extra cash on the side [lipsmack] 

518.78 520.11 A: kinda something they do 

521.08 523.28 A: yeah a little bit on the part time thing 

523.54 525.71 B: or you could do the farmer's market or something 

526.08 527.57 A: yeah 

526.16 531.58 B: [lipsmack] you can get involved in that kind of stuff farmer's markets a lot of places will just allow vendors to come in 

531.59 537.28 A: [lipsmack] yeah and you'd be in good business on mother's day and valentine's day [laughter] 

534.69 536.97 B: oh exactly yes [laughter] 

537.66 540.69 A: you'd have some just a couple of really big days 

540.52 545.98 B: right and that's that's where a lot of businesses are you kind of make up for the businesses 

545.65 553.58 A: well farmer's though you have like easter a lot of people get easter lilies i know my dad buys my mom easter lily every year has to have one 

553.47 557.50 B: oh yeah and poinsettias at christmas time yeah the boy scouts here sell poinsettias 

557.61 559.17 B: like they're going out of style 

558.46 561.74 A: yeah and he buys her one of them every year for christmas 

561.43 563.20 B: right 

562.42 574.37 A: i mean the last easter lily i had to drive all over kewanee and then it turned out it was right uptown was the one i found 'cause all over kewanee was out my dad's the type that waits 'til the last minute 

567.34 568.50 B: [laughter] 

568.85 570.05 B: (( wow )) 

574.01 575.94 B: yes oh that's a [laughter] 

574.58 575.61 A: [laughter] 

576.22 577.42 B: that's a guy thing 

576.23 579.96 A: i always try to remember ahead of time and ask him what do ya need 

581.40 586.85 A: 'cause he will wait until the very last second to tell me he wants something for her it's it's crazy it's like okay 

581.46 582.74 B: (( then you could pl- [lipsmack] )) 

585.72 591.68 B: oh that's the way it is with our salon and day spa business we sold hardly any mother's day gift certificates and 

591.73 592.51 B: (( then )) 

592.91 594.44 B: (( on friday and )) 

593.96 596.41 A: ((  )) 

594.82 596.34 B: (( saturday we sold five )) 

596.98 599.89 B: (( thousand dollars worth each day you know [laughter] yeah [laughter] ))
