112.98 114.04 B: um 

114.23 117.93 B: [lipsmack] i mean i suppose they could come visit but most of them are

129.96 131.63 B: really mhm 

130.70 132.25 A: yeah 'cause we just 

131.73 132.62 B: though 

132.41 133.68 A: so busy 

134.16 137.06 B: [lipsmack] um so what would you miss the most 

138.26 139.70 B: if you had to leave 

138.64 141.64 A: i just think the sense of belonging 

142.18 143.55 B: yeah

146.07 147.31 B: mhm

167.86 177.29 A: and i just [sigh] canada might be okay but it's still different i mean the times that i've gone to canada it's [sigh] 

174.82 175.54 B: right 

177.37 185.89 B: uh-huh well i've only been a couple of times but it seems pretty similar to the u._s. to me like i wasn't there for very long i was only there for like 

182.52 183.98 A: similar but different 

184.47 185.59 A: yeah 

186.52 188.71 B: you know a few days at a time but 

187.93 189.17 A: mhm 

189.21 192.27 B: it seemed very similar to me i don't know [lipsmack] mhm 

192.06 200.58 A: i don't know either i i guess um i've just lived in different parts of the country and even different parts of the country are strange to me 

201.01 204.34 A: you know the americans yeah 

201.29 202.46 B: really 

203.32 205.01 B: the huh where do you live right now 

205.06 207.07 A: [lipsmack] i'm a mid westerner 

206.96 209.49 B: uh-huh yeah yeah i am as well 

207.52 208.45 A: i live 

209.16 210.28 A: oh are you 

210.20 218.78 B: mhm yeah i lived i went to school in chicago i worked there for a couple of years and um now i'm in saint louis so 

218.12 220.31 A: oh i'm in wisconsin 

220.36 221.46 B: oh 

221.20 223.14 A: but i was born in michigan 

223.40 224.67 B: (( okay mhm )) 

224.43 228.62 A: so and all the family is right around here so i'm pretty familiar with 

228.77 230.93 A: with canada too 

230.59 231.45 B: (( mhm )) 

232.31 234.79 A: wish they'd considered alaska 

235.18 236.36 B: really 

235.74 240.41 A: well who's but were not going to get a million bucks so why even think about it 

239.99 244.77 B: right [lipsmack] well i don't know it's just the topic [laughter] so 

243.03 244.31 A: yeah 

244.81 248.13 B: um so what were the other things they said what would you miss the 

248.08 249.43 A: (( what would you )) 

248.54 250.58 B: (( the most and then )) 

249.44 250.86 A: miss the most 

250.91 252.62 A: and um 

253.48 260.86 A: if you went what country would you go to and i think we're both pretty much agreed on canada 

260.82 271.26 B: right well just because it's closest and i actually have some uncles i think i have an uncle and a aunt up there that i never see but yeah i do have some family there actually 

266.75 267.83 A: oh 

271.10 274.54 A: well what i like about it is they speak our language 

274.62 276.89 B: right well you could go to england 

275.78 282.28 A: but as long as we as long as we go to the english part instead of french quebec 

282.21 283.14 B: right 

283.45 286.22 B: well if you want to speak english you can go to like 

283.67 286.84 A: (( [noise] well england's so far away england's )) 

287.11 288.17 B: what's that 

288.27 289.98 A: so far away 

289.66 294.92 B: right but they speak english [laughter] if that's like your primary concern um mm 

291.46 292.80 A: yeah 

294.94 303.24 A: well i think that if i went to a country where they spoke the same language as me i wouldn't feel as 

303.82 304.89 A: alone 

304.90 305.92 B: right 

305.01 306.63 A: you know um 

307.03 311.66 A: because that's that's half that's three quarters of the barrier 

311.77 316.36 A: when you when we go to different countries if we can't speak the language 

316.39 319.33 B: mhm mhm so do you don't speak any foreign languages 

319.67 323.64 A: no a smattering of spanish but nothing to speak ab- 

323.74 325.69 A: nothing to speak of 

325.90 331.64 B: [noise] i took some french in college but i'm definitely not fluent [laughter] 

331.25 343.64 A: well that's the funny part i was a spanish honors student and i don't remember any of it you're i think that it's the old adage if we don't use it we lose it 

336.13 336.98 B: oh 

337.32 338.48 B: really 

343.37 345.08 B: yeah that's true 

346.17 347.22 B: yeah 

347.27 349.71 B: [lipsmack] um yeah that matters a lot 

350.35 350.94 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

351.19 355.62 B: um so were there any other parts to the question that they asked i don't remember 

354.99 359.37 A: [noise] [laughter] lets see um 

363.15 365.43 A: what we miss the most 

366.99 369.22 A: i can't remember any other 

370.33 372.00 A: any any other parts 

372.24 374.51 A: so what would you do with the million bucks 

375.56 377.10 B: (( um )) 

376.42 380.37 A: we'd probably have to buy a decent place to live in canada 

380.42 387.60 B: right right well i don't know if the million isn't like a million after taxes then 

387.96 391.13 B: yeah i'd probably probably get a house 

391.55 394.16 B: maybe travel a little bit um 

394.76 400.06 B: invest it all those cliches that's not [laughter] not the greatest thing to do 

399.75 401.19 A: [noise] i know 

400.39 402.37 B: but um [lipsmack] 

403.56 411.93 B: yeah well it's not like such a large amount of money that you'd never have to work again type of thing but um specially after buying a house 

412.64 414.34 A: i'm telling ya 

412.84 413.85 B: (( but ah )) 

415.65 419.22 B: yeah so that's probably what i'd do buy a house and then travel some 

419.52 420.92 B: and look for a new job 

419.75 421.53 A: yeah 

421.16 421.78 B: (( [laughter] )) 

421.82 428.45 A: yeah you you're not married i'm not married we can we could probably ah find a husband 

429.14 430.60 B: mm maybe 

432.03 432.86 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

433.55 436.54 B: um so what would you do would you do s- 

436.66 438.87 B: the same sort of thing travel and 

437.82 439.97 A: well [sigh] 

440.60 441.22 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

443.16 444.13 A: i 

444.54 447.13 A: i guess i'd have to consider it 

448.81 451.67 A: but canada would be as far as i'd go 

452.44 454.04 B: now what would you do after 

453.04 460.16 A: you know i just don't like the idea i'm a typical american i don't like the idea of someone telling me that i can't come back 

461.00 462.32 A: i'm just so 

462.45 471.21 A: you know as long as i've got choices and what if i get there and i don't like the water or s- some stupid thing 

472.73 476.21 B: um you could buy bottled water at the store [laughter] 

475.49 476.93 A: ah 

476.60 478.82 B: with your million dollars 

478.21 479.66 A: yeah 

480.13 485.64 A: i don't know i i i guess i'd go to i guess i'd go to canada 

486.59 490.47 A: c- you don't need a a passport there do ya 

490.61 491.99 B: (( to go to canada i )) 

491.44 492.96 A: yeah 

492.06 494.84 B: think you might actually i don't know 

495.32 497.21 A: i don't think i used one 

495.56 498.35 B: these days they're i think the immigration stuff is 

498.71 500.92 A: oh it's getting difficult 

499.84 502.95 B: more yeah it's definitely harder but 

502.70 505.46 A: the canadians sure like coming here 

503.13 503.96 B: (( i don't know )) 

505.79 506.89 B: what's that 

506.61 517.41 A: the canadians sure like coming here you know um i know a lot that are ah were born in canada and and they've even not got dual citiz- citizenship 

517.13 518.93 B: oh yeah hm 

518.45 520.22 A: yeah 

520.54 528.02 A: i had a girl friend down in florida that moved here from england and oh she was homesick for her country 

528.10 529.19 B: (( really did )) 

528.85 529.93 A: yeah 

530.30 531.52 B: she go back 

532.05 534.11 A: yeah eventually 

533.97 534.80 B: (( hm )) 

535.50 537.71 B: [lipsmack] well i don't know 

537.79 540.30 B: if their restriction was 

541.03 547.94 B: we had to move somewhere else but we could come visit i would probably do it but if it was like we can never come back to the united states ever 

546.15 547.59 A: (( [noise] right )) 

548.44 550.01 B: then ah no 

549.03 550.79 A: well that's not feasible 

550.64 553.21 B: yeah that's that's a lot harder 

552.96 554.03 A: right 

554.90 555.91 B: (( [noise] so )) 

556.02 558.01 B: (( [lipsmack] i don't know an interesting )) 

557.16 559.32 A: but you know in like with 

559.23 572.32 A: it depends on what country you're from and what country you go to but we have ah different treaties with different countries and and like my girl friend from england she had to leave 

572.41 574.58 A: the states every year 

575.42 576.42 B: (( question really hm )) 

576.08 577.07 A: yeah 

578.10 586.64 A: she didn't necessarily have to go back to england but it'd be interesting to know if what kind of stipulations there is between 

588.61 592.77 A: it's anything to m- go into lightly i guess 

593.82 596.81 B: that's strange why did she have to leave every year 

597.40 599.89 A: it was just part of our ah
