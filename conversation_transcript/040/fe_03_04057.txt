122.46 123.62 B: i know 

124.24 126.72 B: that's why you take the money like there's a 

126.13 130.20 A: yeah [laughter] yeah it'd be a very small thing to do 

130.00 133.52 B: store around south street philadelphia record exchange where 

133.82 136.51 B: i think it's three or four guys who own it and they're

160.01 161.01 B: wow 

162.52 163.49 B: huh 

163.39 165.21 A: so it's kinda interesting

165.49 166.40 A: yeah 

167.87 175.37 A: i'm looking into it i have a lot of uh you know i haven't sign- signed sealed and delivered anything yet but i'm uh i'm i'm heading in that direction 

175.41 186.77 A: you know i need s- you know some backer well for this thing money wouldn't be an option but generally speaking i'm looking for some backers and you know so and it would initially once 'cause once the ball gets rolling then everything's fine 

175.42 176.21 B: wh- 

179.61 180.80 B: (( [noise] right )) 

186.17 189.65 B: what'll be the first couple of steps to sign a backer and then find a location 

189.59 192.64 A: oh lo- location i pretty much um 

192.46 203.49 A: [lipsmack] have an idea i wanna i wanna kinda i wanna stay down south i mean even though up here i i go down south a lot and it's missing it's missing down there like new or- not necessarily new orleans itself but like 

203.26 209.31 A: florida the atlantic area 'cause th- those places are are thriving now and 

205.54 206.47 B: huh 

208.21 210.19 B: (( oh so you don't want to do it in new york )) 

209.64 213.78 A: [mn] no i don't know uh i think new york is a little um 

213.91 218.76 A: [lipsmack] there's too much of a good thing here there's like i think too many people are doing it 

215.73 216.69 B: right 

218.19 220.17 B: right so would you move 

219.80 231.48 A: [mn] oh well that's part of the thing i don't not looking to move now and i don't and uh i just wanna get get myself established down there set it up and have somebody run it for me down there 

230.89 236.17 B: right that's the most important thing would probably be once you get it all established finding like a good booker 

231.55 233.16 A: and um 

236.15 239.30 A: yeah exactly you know so like i got the um 

239.24 245.44 A: [lipsmack] i i have uh i have some people that are wil- are willing to run it but you know they wanna you know 

245.33 258.54 A: make a decent amount of money and when you start out you can't pay good so you know but again for this thing money wouldn't be an option so [laughter] you know if money wasn't an option then yeah you know give 'em you know like something compatible or just to 

247.94 248.96 B: right 

251.16 252.83 B: right [laughter] 

257.99 262.13 B: yeah if money wasn't an option i'd i'd open up an arena you know [laughter] 

260.49 271.17 A: [laughter] yeah exactly if money wasn't an option i'd have a little back persuade them to come play every two weeks or whatever you know but uh actually i think he's playing down in philly too
