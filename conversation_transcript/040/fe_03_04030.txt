79.70 86.60 B: well you know it's a situation where you know i might be tempted to do so but ah 

79.75 80.77 A: (( ah [mn] [mn] )) 

87.17 89.78 B: there's that's one thing about 

90.70 94.66 B: [mn] my bringing up anyway let me put it that way 

94.99 97.09 B: in other words you wouldn't do it [noise] 

96.68 99.55 A: [noise] yeah so is there a situation where you would do it 

100.39 105.56 B: no not i- not in that situation if it- it's [noise] in regard to murder [noise] 

105.85 109.68 A: ah what about i don't know something some lesser crime 

110.38 113.25 B: in other words um 

113.19 119.44 A: i don't know um i don't know maybe drunk driving and then they ask you how many drinks did he have at your house [mn] 

114.49 115.29 B: (( ah )) 

116.43 117.47 B: okay 

118.91 120.95 B: yeah well [noise] 

121.42 122.91 B: (( ah [noise] )) 

122.63 124.88 A: drunk driving no no um 

125.22 127.49 A: nobody hurt [mn] you know no accident 

127.17 128.94 B: yeah well 

129.53 131.17 A: how many drinks did he have with 

129.62 133.43 B: [mn] ah ah still that would be difficult to do ah 

133.92 141.38 B: course first of all he wouldn't be drinking at my house because we don't drink i mean you know alcoholic beverages 

138.85 139.92 A: well 

140.93 144.51 A: [laughter] well okay so let's say you were out at dinner 

144.42 145.24 B: (( yes )) 

144.93 149.96 A: and he ordered a couple well then it would be on the receipt but i don't know let- let's say that he ordered 

149.85 161.60 A: two drinks but um so the receipt's gonna show just two drinks but i don't know some best of his was at the table next to you and sent over two rounds of drinks that aren't gonna show up on the receipt 

162.22 165.63 B: well i'd have to say i don't know [laughter] i didn't 

164.73 166.61 A: and then they say how many 

165.66 168.14 B: i didn't see how many drinks he had 

167.48 168.61 A: (( [laughter] )) 

168.20 169.34 B: [laughter] 

169.60 171.11 A: but you did see 

170.27 173.80 B: i see what i'm doing i'm trying to evade the 

172.90 176.28 A: [laughter] you're gonna evade you're gonna say i don't know i wasn't paying attention 

173.92 175.37 B: (( question [laughter] )) 

175.57 176.31 B: (( [laughter] )) 

177.01 178.39 B: (( [mn] ah )) 

178.28 190.80 A: but let's say you did really really know because you noticed that he ordered two and you like were kind of surprised that he drank the other two like you were paying attention 'cause this was sort of unlike your friend to be drinking four drinks [laughter] 

180.77 181.61 B: (( yeah )) 

187.36 189.37 B: (( right yeah yeah )) 

191.55 198.26 B: ah i i still don't think i would because it's kind of ingrained within me 

198.55 201.17 B: in other words eventually you know 

199.47 201.01 A: but 

201.50 205.76 B: in most cases the truth comes out as my mother used to say 

204.18 206.14 A: yeah well 

206.34 209.07 B: i can tell it'll eventually come 

209.11 211.97 B: out [laughter] the truth will come out 

211.51 215.33 A: all right so for your friends with the drinks you're going to pretend that you really didn't know 

215.23 216.45 B: right 

215.82 222.07 A: you're not gonna lie and say he didn't drink or he only had two you're just gonna say i really don't know 

219.16 220.39 B: (( no no )) 

221.67 223.58 B: no i wouldn't 

224.35 225.41 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

226.49 227.22 A: (( all )) 

227.23 227.88 A: (( right )) 

229.14 233.49 A: okay [mn] ah i don't know no i do- i mean for me i i wouldn't 

234.39 234.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

235.63 236.82 B: [laughter] 

236.03 240.53 A: i would- no no no i mean i wou- i definitely wouldn't perjure myself um 

239.36 240.21 B: right 

240.54 250.01 A: obviously if you know something and you don't want to particularly reveal it [mn] i mean [mn] y- y- you might try to find a way to 

245.39 246.38 B: yeah 

247.24 248.09 B: yeah 

249.89 251.05 B: get around it 

250.25 252.94 A: to evade it um but 

253.05 256.11 B: well you know i i could say this 

253.33 254.00 A: (( i- )) 

256.73 261.50 B: that if it would cau- cause um [mn] 

262.89 263.99 B: (( ah )) 

265.16 266.44 B: [noise] let me think of it 

267.09 274.15 B: [laughter] [noise] i think there are times that i might like ah if it meant um 

274.26 282.89 B: uh creating ah a- a- a big stink about something that you know that wasn't a wasn't that ah [noise] 

283.22 284.81 B: grave of a matter 

283.38 284.30 A: (( [mn] so a- )) 

284.71 289.99 A: right well i guess i'm picturing 'cause i mean 'cause they said perjury which to me is lying 

289.59 290.88 B: right 

290.45 295.80 A: lying b- it isn't just lying it's lying before a court you know sworn testimony 

293.43 295.15 B: oh i see 

295.59 296.93 B: yeah 

296.43 310.67 A: i i think that's the definition um you know like like bill clinton with it depends on what your definition of is is but no i mean yeah i mean perjury is is testimony you know sworn testimony before a court or other you know sort of similar 

298.12 299.17 B: (( [noise] well )) 

302.97 303.92 B: right 

308.79 310.13 B: i see 

310.39 311.62 B: okay 

311.19 313.39 A: so then it isn't like 

313.49 317.59 A: you know at w- at work where you just might not say something [laughter] 

313.74 314.57 B: (( i )) 

316.96 324.52 B: right or [noise] or try to protect somebody from losing his job or or something like that 

323.28 325.08 A: yeah yeah 

326.08 327.27 B: um 

326.12 330.49 A: you know you you notice the guy came in late but you just don't bring it to anybody's attention 

327.75 328.60 B: yeah 

330.22 333.03 B: right ah it's ah 

333.63 334.55 B: you know 

334.88 338.54 B: going before a court and so forth i [noise] 

338.59 341.76 B: have three sons that are in law enforcement [mn] 

342.40 347.44 B: and [sigh] you know some of the things that happens in courts and so on ah 

346.75 347.73 A: yeah 

348.12 351.09 B: ah i i- in other words i'm 

350.13 354.24 A: including plenty of law enforcement people perjuring themselves [laughter] 

353.24 358.38 B: [mn] right but the thing is having seen it in courts that people 

357.64 358.56 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

358.51 363.41 B: try to protect lie for somebody and ah 

363.44 365.47 B: they get themselves in trouble 

365.31 366.46 A: yeah that's true 

366.00 370.49 B: legally and so i'm gonna protect myself [laughter] 

370.25 377.31 A: yeah no i agree with that i mean i'm not perjuring myself i mean actually i i mean i'm an attorney and i'm not putting my license on the line for anybody 

372.71 374.39 B: no right 

376.79 377.97 B: right 

377.41 384.86 A: ah you know i- i'm not an- and i think the whole idea that like you said like [mn] hopefully somehow the truth comes out 

384.20 385.40 B: (( yeah right )) 

384.87 385.96 A: um 

386.29 393.18 A: [mn] you know i'm not adding to that by lying even if i know for sure this is my best friend they didn't murder anybody 

393.21 394.26 A: um 

395.35 401.13 A: [mn] somehow there's gotta be some proof of that somewhere and you're not gonna get me to lie for you 

400.80 402.36 B: (( [noise] [mn] right )) 

401.84 402.75 A: i may 

403.12 404.18 A: you know 

405.18 413.80 A: [sigh] give you the benefit of the doubt that okay well i looked at my watch it said nine thirty and you know maybe they dawdled around the house for another few minutes saying good bye 

413.45 414.71 B: mhm [noise] 

413.97 415.01 A: you know 

414.76 416.03 B: (( right [noise] )) 

416.11 422.22 A: and and then th- and it could have been as much as five or ten i don't know but um you know but [laughter] 

419.36 420.67 B: yeah right 

422.84 423.79 A: um 

424.46 427.05 A: [mn] i'm not giving you that you were at my house to ten 

425.84 426.82 B: yeah 

427.42 430.32 B: well if if i really knew 

430.68 436.56 B: you know exactly i mean that's the way i would i would do it i mean 

436.81 445.00 B: to tell the truth in regard to the matter i not that [mn] in other words it would be difficult to do because ah 

443.35 449.61 A: yeah yeah if i sat there and looked at my watch and it said nine thirty and i said okay it's nine thirty you've gotta go now 

449.04 450.36 B: right 

449.86 451.91 A: then i'm stuck with my nine thirty 

451.51 453.20 B: yeah 

453.28 456.65 B: so hm again ah 

458.42 462.88 B: have i lied in the past i'd i'd be a liar if a told you i hadn't 

462.51 464.16 A: yeah everybody's lied 

463.09 467.17 B: but it's not in i've not been to court [laughter] 

465.99 466.87 A: [laughter] 

467.46 468.83 B: i mean in 

468.19 469.51 A: (( i guess [mn] )) 

469.59 472.80 A: no wait we actually asked about perjury now what if it was yourself 

472.94 475.58 A: like let's see what's at stake 

475.48 476.73 B: (( ah )) 

476.11 478.36 A: (( i don't know um )) 

478.64 480.98 B: in other words it could be my job 

481.50 482.83 B: (( ah )) 

483.03 491.87 B: it could be [noise] ah protecting my own family or to cover up for my own family [noise] ah 

487.72 488.90 A: yeah 

491.99 493.59 A: like like you're 

494.11 494.69 A: (( [mn] )) 

494.93 503.98 A: your your wife is selling a bunch of stuff on ebay and not reporting her ea- her earnings [laughter] [laughter] they're coming after you for tax evasion [laughter] 

499.14 500.00 B: right 

501.12 502.39 B: ah now there's 

503.14 507.72 B: yeah well that see there's the difficult part [laughter] 

506.21 507.09 A: [laughter] 

508.02 508.92 B: funny 

508.03 510.09 A: and now you know [laughter] 

509.33 513.42 B: [laughter] yeah but the point is ah 

510.80 512.04 A: [laughter] 

513.17 514.99 A: [laughter] 

514.04 520.87 B: i've you know ah i found out in as time has gone along i'm seventy five years old so 

521.04 530.22 B: i've filed a number of income tax ah forms and there i've found out that i there were things i could have deducted that i didn't 

524.40 525.59 A: mhm 

525.79 527.03 A: hopefully 

529.70 530.65 A: yeah 

530.65 533.72 B: (( and so ah )) 

534.45 537.79 B: anyway i got to the place that um 

538.18 539.61 B: (( i would ah )) 

539.69 543.24 B: well now look look here i can take this off 

543.66 548.05 B: and yet in my own mind i i i wasn't sure that i could [laughter] 

547.19 548.19 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

548.45 553.35 A: well it's like that that what is it the one on on like charitable donations there's you know 

552.24 553.16 B: yeah 

553.82 560.85 A: and i think you can take like five hundred dollars without having receipts or itemization or whatever and 

558.41 559.25 B: right 

561.02 563.39 A: you know i think everybody just takes that 

563.31 567.48 B: yeah whether they did or not [laughter] 

564.07 564.96 A: i mean 

565.69 566.93 A: yeah i mean 

567.00 573.72 A: no i think most people i mean i could probably i mean any i i mean i do it but i know in any given year i've i give away stuff 

573.61 578.02 B: yeah so that's that's my point too is ah 

574.48 575.73 A: but 

577.31 589.37 A: i mean what is it really worth i don't know what are my old clothes really worth you know but household stuff whatever but but i figure all in all in a year it's probably gotta add up to five hundred but i don't ah you know 

581.34 582.25 B: right 

588.90 590.29 B: yeah right 

589.52 590.87 A: never sat there and actually 

591.30 596.48 A: analyzed it to worry if i was claiming five hundred when it should've been four seventy five 

595.83 598.97 B: yeah yeah i understand 

598.50 599.66 A: [laughter] 

599.05 599.90 B: well being a
