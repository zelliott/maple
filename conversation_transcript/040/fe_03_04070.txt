185.04 187.71 A: uh different uh karmic 

187.80 189.49 A: situations in life 

189.64 193.12 A: and whose to say um that perhaps 

193.35 197.00 A: my path uh has already been predetermined 

196.89 198.66 B: [noise] [lipsmack] what do you mean by that 

198.50 199.82 A: (( i beg your pardon )) 

199.42 201.72 B: what do you mean by it's been predetermined 

201.74 203.05 A: predetermined 

202.71 204.04 B: yeah 

204.08 212.35 A: well um it came as quite a shock to me when my fourteenth amendment rights were violated in nineteen eighty two 

212.63 221.96 A: and all my money was taken from me because i was a woman and so therefore i was not allow- [laughter] i just was not able to proceed 

222.00 225.62 A: in purchasing a dental practice you see 

225.56 227.84 B: [lipsmack] what do you mean your money was taken from ya 

225.89 226.61 A: so 

227.51 228.54 A: well 

230.64 241.65 A: the uh there are there are ways in um certain states uh for are you familiar perhaps you may be familiar with the fourteenth amendment 

241.02 242.55 B: no not really 

241.94 246.35 A: that um [lipsmack] well actually abraham lincoln 

247.48 256.40 A: uh proposed that amendment so that uh black men and black men could be treated the same as white 

256.44 263.94 A: men however what we left out of th- the equation of course is women women still do not have equal rights so 

264.13 272.93 A: women are still considered according to the supreme court decision i think it's nineteen seventy f- uh eighteen seventy five blackwell 

273.15 275.62 A: is that women are only [lipsmack] 

275.83 276.69 A: (( um )) 

277.21 279.83 A: property they're they're like um 

280.21 285.49 A: they were born they were created to be wives and mothers only so they 

285.64 295.23 A: don't have the same kind of rights and i know i'm going on a little bit but what happened was that my family it turned out 

295.24 303.94 A: didn't was not supportive of my becoming a professional and so what they did was behind my back they went to um [lipsmack] 

304.24 305.45 A: they went to 

305.63 307.37 A: uh the court 

307.52 309.25 A: they went to the court 

309.32 311.75 A: and uh had um 

311.82 313.26 A: basically 

314.13 322.00 A: didn't what h- had they been doing here in the united states for a long time putting putting women um who might be slightly eccentric 

322.63 329.55 A: maybe very eccentric as in my case [laughter] um out of view you know and to 

326.60 327.18 B: (( [noise] )) 

328.93 331.78 B: but how can your family go to the courts and do that though 

331.38 333.60 A: well they my brother is a lawyer 

333.46 336.43 B: yeah but what gives them the right to do that 

333.62 334.80 A: and 

335.93 347.58 A: [lipsmack] um probably nothing uh now that i i have a ten million dollar lawsuit and um he was actually acting uh unjustifiably because um 

348.92 354.41 A: [lipsmack] according to the uh code of ethics of the american bourke association 

354.46 357.78 A: uh a lawyer who represents a client 

358.48 360.55 A: is should not ever 

361.35 364.37 A: conduct an adverse ruling 

364.55 367.22 A: against that same client 

367.54 369.28 A: so we did that but 

369.45 371.50 A: um you know since 

370.23 374.03 B: so is is that affecting you starting your own business then or what 

374.00 379.23 A: well the the hypothesis that was given to me was that 

379.40 382.42 A: yes well of course i was homeless 

382.78 387.15 A: since nineteen eighty two i've i've been homeless you know living in 

387.28 393.26 A: one dwelling after another um different ashrams i've lived in ashrams uh 

389.53 391.01 B: [mn] so your fam- your 

393.57 401.10 A: all over the country you know but which has which has definitely allowed me to become more spiritual 

400.83 402.18 B: so your family 

402.48 405.19 B: took you to court or took your money away 

404.21 407.41 A: no they didn't take me to court they did it without even 

405.33 406.37 B: no but 

407.05 409.10 B: right but they they took your money away 

408.82 410.23 A: yeah 

409.60 411.08 B: behind your back 

410.39 415.58 A: i didn't even i have never seen it it was just a slight of hand it was just 

414.35 417.43 B: and and then and then they left you homeless 

417.14 427.63 A: yeah they just i don't um it's like the old pattern of if someone is doing something that you don't them to do 

427.66 432.79 A: you uh make them suffer for it and then they'll maybe they'll change their ways 

433.10 436.04 B: [mn] i'm confused though 'cause on on what grounds 

435.07 437.87 A: you're confused well um 

436.70 438.97 B: [laughter] i'm sure you are too but 

438.64 442.37 A: [laughter] no i'm not confused at all uh not not a bit 

441.48 446.59 B: what on what grounds did they have to take this your possessions away from you 

445.27 450.58 A: well i mean again you know blackwell versus the supreme court decision is that women 

450.49 463.22 A: my mother had nine kids so um it was probably her opinion and my father's opinion and every man in my family's opinion that women were created to have babies and to be mothers and wives so 

462.16 470.85 B: right but but were they thinking that you were unstable and you couldn't take care of yourself or what i mean if you're a healthy human being 

467.53 474.87 A: no i don't i think that they just no they just uh you know there are people out there who are bigots 

475.03 479.65 A: there are there are bigots and i've come to realize that you know my family 

479.50 491.36 A: are like that they are bigots they are bigoted and and and and it's taken me some time to come to understand how i was betrayed it wasn't easy for me to 

491.74 493.84 A: understand that at all 

493.89 496.73 A: and you know i've been going on for years [laughter] thinking 

496.96 504.09 A: not without without really too much of a clue but since i'm a poet poetess and i've i've 

502.92 503.54 B: [noise] 

504.22 505.94 A: i've uh i 

506.23 514.34 A: started to write my poetry and i've actually i'm i'm now entered into a semi finals in a poetry contest 

514.36 521.83 A: but that has helped me to break with some of the blocks that kept me from realizing 

522.10 525.30 A: the you know how my family did betray me 

525.35 530.22 A: and maybe maybe even how my mother betrayed herself i mean because 

525.37 526.88 B: so [noise] 

530.25 535.84 A: i knew i'm the the oldest girl in the family but you wanted to say something 

535.70 544.60 B: no i i was just wondering is this like all the stuff that you've gone through is that some of the reasons why you wanna start the the type of businesses that you wanna start 

544.86 546.56 A: [lipsmack] well 

546.48 557.30 B: i mean is it kinda like 'cause that's that's almost like in helping profession as far as like the dentistry but also with the uh um treating the person holistically 

548.57 549.48 A: when 

551.07 552.71 A: yeah 

552.83 554.55 A: yeah 

554.61 555.66 A: i know 

557.21 568.98 A: well my uh dr goldman from boston university uh he was a great pioneer in periodontics i didn't know him personally but he was the like the founder 

569.05 573.71 A: of boston university's school of graduate dentistry from which i graduated 

573.71 587.13 A: and um we were always taught during the four years of dental school to look at the whole person of course when i graduated and i went into the army i was just a you you know plain old tooth doctor you know 

587.45 590.99 A: (( sit down open your mouth do it you know boom boom boom )) 

591.25 594.07 B: did you do did you do the dentist thing in the army or 

591.45 592.63 A: and 

592.87 595.19 A: (( of course excuse me )) 

594.61 598.17 B: did you do the dentist thing in the army too were you a dentist okay 

596.57 598.50 A: of course yeah of course 

598.74 599.89 A: i was in
