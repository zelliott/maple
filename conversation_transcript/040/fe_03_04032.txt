26.72 30.29 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] i don't know 'cause some of our laws right now i think are 

30.48 34.33 B: should need to be changed so if it was a law that i didn't agree with 

34.95 36.23 B: maybe 

36.45 40.09 B: i don't know i guess it really depended on the situation 

39.89 43.06 A: yeah and and and the repercussions 

42.81 45.77 B: of course [laughter] 

43.54 44.77 A: [laughter]

71.61 77.46 B: my grandma actually had was in a nursing home and she fell and broke her back 

77.63 84.15 B: and they um left her laying there for twelve or nine hours before calling the doctor or myself or my mom 

83.76 85.09 A: oh my god 

84.66 87.60 B: so my mom's got a law suit against the nursing home 

87.90 93.67 B: so i had to go in and they had to ask me all kinds of questions [laughter]

101.88 113.13 B: it's okay she passed last year it's actually been three years since the fall but it just is all tangled up and they keep postponing it and it's just kind of taking forever [sigh] 

113.06 117.42 A: yeah i i'm know about that i had a couple of law suits that took forever 

117.10 118.60 B: yeah 

119.16 120.58 A: including one 

120.79 128.60 A: one i had recently that that um they thought i was lying and the others other party said i was lying yeah 

126.19 127.90 B: really 

127.98 129.28 B: that's a shame 

128.85 135.59 A: mhm but i but i i wasn't as a matter of fact i was more truthful than my lawyer would really like me to have been 

135.01 137.04 B: [laughter] 

136.77 139.46 A: but i've always 

139.98 145.03 A: really much more come out ahead by telling the truth although 

146.25 152.42 A: for somebody else it might not work in certain situations i i found that it for me it has 

149.45 150.64 B: right 

152.14 156.76 B: right honesty is the best policy really even though some people might not want to hear it 

156.57 159.87 A: yeah i know the my mother had drilled into my head 

157.06 158.69 B: [laughter] 

160.07 161.25 B: yeah [laughter] 

161.39 162.34 A: and um 

161.50 169.14 B: i don't know i don't i have a daughter she's eight i don't know what i don't know if i would lie i guess it just depended on really what 

169.51 171.26 B: was happening 

171.77 176.26 B: if i thought she was really at wrong and at fault 

176.69 182.70 B: i would probably want her to learn from her mistakes but if i didn't think it was fair 

180.17 181.93 A: but how much 

182.10 185.05 A: yeah i mean like how how 'cause some 

185.72 189.52 A: some um the p- punishment for whatever it might be 

189.64 197.43 A: is just too devastating i mean you don't need to learn this lesson i mean why what what for why do you have to learn something 

191.97 193.19 B: (( right )) 

193.77 195.02 B: right 

197.74 202.00 A: you know i i mean in the end i mean what's the difference 

198.53 199.58 B: yeah 

201.64 202.78 B: right 

204.08 206.24 B: so how'd you find out about this study

224.88 227.08 B: oh really [laughter] 

225.08 234.38 A: [laughter] and it was it was hard you know a- and he was um i think he was trying to impress because he was 

234.75 240.92 A: um he was thinking of unity day or i i mean we had to think of a holiday that um 

241.87 243.41 A: we might like 

244.17 245.08 A: um 

245.81 246.84 A: (( you know j- a ))

262.84 263.88 A: okay 

264.46 265.85 B: perjury 

265.63 267.17 A: perjury right 

266.45 267.95 B: yeah 

267.23 276.06 A: i'm pretty sure i'd probably oh i guess that i'd probably i'm ah generally not a liar and i'd probably try to skate around the truth 

275.93 277.69 B: [laughter] 

276.16 278.32 A: if it was [laughter] 

277.71 279.95 B: exactly [laughter] 

278.60 285.19 A: if if it was gonna hurt either me or my loved ones but in the end i mean if it was 

281.92 282.99 B: (( [noise] right )) 

285.58 290.18 A: too too deep of a lesson to learn i would definitely lie 

290.08 292.11 B: yeah i think i would too 

292.70 296.93 B: 'cause some of our laws just really need to be reworked in my opinion 

296.41 297.53 A: mhm 

301.40 303.46 A: let's see if i've lied recently 

303.29 305.45 B: [noise] [laughter] [laughter] 

303.58 307.36 A: [laughter] well we have to talk about it so [laughter] 

309.58 311.43 B: i was under oath today 

311.65 313.48 A: right so you didn't lie 

313.10 314.57 B: no i didn't 

316.09 323.65 B: no and my mom also was depositioned and she also had to take an oath and as far as i know she didn't lie either [laughter] 

324.12 326.16 B: it's a sad case 

325.68 327.63 A: yeah 

327.64 331.11 B: they ah we actually came in and they had ants 

331.29 334.56 B: all over her bed and ants were crawling on her 

335.11 337.19 A: oh my god 

336.57 342.46 B: and we complained and threw fits we brought in ant traps and ant spray 'cause they wouldn't do nothing 

342.59 346.11 B: and she was only there a month she had the stroke 

345.80 346.77 A: mhm 

346.56 353.88 B: we put her in the nursing home and she was only there a month before she fell and broke her back and we we moved her out of there of course 

354.58 358.14 B: and we actually got a deposition before she had passed away 

358.24 367.35 B: so we kinda got her side and she you know said yes there was ants on me but they're they're saying we're lying that there wasn't no ants because their people didn't um 

359.90 360.93 A: mhm 

365.55 366.26 A: (( oh )) 

367.72 371.59 B: write it down in the record book or the complaint book 

371.55 375.27 A: well i guess not [laughter] yeah why would they 

372.85 374.32 B: right of course 

374.74 377.17 B: right you know 

375.40 376.04 A: (( um )) 

377.80 384.52 B: yeah they they asked me the same question like ten different ways to i guess try to see if i was lying or tripping up or something 

382.75 385.21 A: mhm yeah 

384.77 387.24 B: same answer every time 

392.21 392.89 A: hm 

392.99 395.55 A: [laughter] 

393.92 398.31 B: [laughter] it's a weird question to talk about huh 

395.67 396.32 A: (( ah )) 

397.92 402.53 A: yeah um ah and just one perjury perjury perjury

406.29 410.82 B: (( [noise] yeah we would [laughter] )) 

408.26 414.24 A: yeah [laughter] we'd lie oh boy i mean and it doesn't make us bad people 

414.28 415.14 B: (( no )) 

415.00 420.58 A: it just makes us good people because we care about who we love 'cause you can get in trouble for perjury 

420.32 421.58 B: that's right 

420.92 425.04 A: but we don't want who we care about to be hurt 

424.30 425.29 B: right

445.02 446.09 B: right 

446.10 447.69 B: well you know 

446.48 454.40 A: well he didn't really i mean you know if you could work it out mentally whereas you're not really lying 

454.91 455.93 B: right then 

455.78 464.12 A: then you're not really lying you're just you're sort of on the very edge of a lie [laughter] hm 

461.65 463.38 B: [laughter]
