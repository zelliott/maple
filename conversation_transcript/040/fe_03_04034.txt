17.53 19.69 B: (( yeah )) 

17.83 27.46 A: i i think that it's a pretty relative situation that's i think it would be pretty difficult to say about you know to generalize about it to say that i would or wouldn't for a friend or 

27.74 31.15 A: or family member it could depend on the situation 

28.97 30.33 B: (( mhm )) 

32.55 33.63 B: (( i couldn't )) 

32.66 33.80 A: what do you think 

34.84 45.04 B: i've never been able to in the first place my my ah straight laced truthfulness gets me in trouble [laughter] to much in in my situation i just [noise] 

41.84 43.60 A: oh yeah 

45.36 51.45 B: i've not ever been able to but i have to say if it were were my husband or child [noise] or mother or something 

51.61 53.90 B: i'd sure be hard pressed 

54.46 58.37 B: you know it would be a hard thing to do you know not 

54.77 56.55 A: i know i feel like 

57.40 59.18 A: i totally agree 

58.90 60.43 B: you know it wouldn't be like 

59.27 62.65 A: especially if it was a a child you have children 

62.28 64.06 B: yes i have a little baby 

64.24 66.31 A: oh how old is she or he

68.19 69.31 A: wow 

71.20 76.46 B: i'm sure she could probably get into something and do something and do something no she didn't do it or yeah she did it hm 

76.39 81.32 A: i know especially if it's like the difference between like you seeing your baby or not 

80.68 86.67 B: [noise] mm yeah that would be yeah that that would be a hard one 

81.65 83.55 A: you know like ah 

86.26 88.32 A: it would be really hard right 

87.66 90.90 B: mm i think so [laughter] yeah 

90.29 102.73 A: i think so too i think that i would it would really depend but i think that i'm not necessarily a straight laced person but i think that under the pressure of of the court system and and being in that kind of situation it would be really hard to lie 

103.66 107.20 A: knowing kind of like the ramifications of lying 

106.63 109.80 B: (( [noise] oh yeah mhm yeah )) 

108.70 110.96 A: you could end up in prison and then 

111.39 112.84 A: (( no one needs that )) 

113.33 115.53 B: [noise] yeah yeah 

114.15 115.08 A: um

150.53 151.60 A: but ah 

153.04 161.13 B: i don't know how long they want us to talk about that 'cause that's kind of a most people pretty well kinda have a straight answer on that one don't they 

153.37 154.46 A: that 

160.36 171.41 A: i know it's like how do you really talk about that without specific circumstances to talk about i've never even been in a court before i've have you ever had to be in a court situation where you've even had to do that 

163.07 163.92 B: (( [noise] )) 

165.95 167.03 B: yeah 

167.86 168.51 B: (( no )) 

170.85 172.68 B: no no 

172.69 179.20 B: no and i dare say that would be a intriguing situation you know if it was somebody else hard as that would be you know 

179.47 181.75 B: i'd tell the truth but 

182.08 189.88 A: the closest i've come is i i got a speeding ticket once then another speeding ticket i got a ticket because my one of my tail lights was out 

184.85 186.26 B: yeah 

186.86 187.63 B: (( [noise] )) 

189.46 190.47 B: (( mhm mm )) 

190.08 198.62 A: and then i went back to court and the guy was like so did you get your tail light fixed and i said that i did even though i didn't 

198.16 200.29 B: yeah yeah 

198.83 205.08 A: and so he's just like well i need to see your car then so i was kinda stuck right there like i was caught in a lie 

202.03 203.14 B: (( yeah )) 

203.52 204.57 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

205.69 215.42 A: and he's like well you need to go get your car and i need to look at it but i was like well my car isn't really available right now so i had to go and get it fixed and then bring it back 

212.56 213.43 B: yeah 

214.14 216.14 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

215.80 222.61 A: but it kind of made me really nervous just that feeling in my chest of knowing that i had gotten caught in a lie 

221.80 224.04 B: (( [noise] mm mhm )) 

222.75 232.08 A: even just for something as small as that made me made me so uncomfortable because i think that part of it is like feeling so incredibly intimidated by the law system 

224.87 226.50 B: (( oh yeah )) 

230.94 232.05 B: (( yeah )) 

232.74 234.06 A: and um 

233.41 235.64 B: (( yeah )) 

234.34 237.91 A: just having like this like strict white man in front of me 

238.15 244.55 A: um you know being so so cruel and unforgiving about kind of like the dumbest thing 

243.01 252.49 B: hm yeah it's like not everybody has the money to fix the tail light upon [noise] immediately finding out you know or headlight for that matter it's like what do people do 

249.68 250.83 A: i know 

252.87 254.00 A: i know 

253.43 256.51 B: [noise] go to your rich uncle or something oh yeah mhm 

255.98 257.67 A: yeah exactly 

257.24 264.51 B: [noise] but well i i did something one time i went um i was speeding in the middle of the night and then um 

265.11 277.32 B: i got caught and i knew i was going like fifty in a thirty and when they pulled me i had never been pulled over and when they pulled [noise] me over my heart dropped and and ah it was just like 

278.12 286.73 B: there was no way to lie and no reason to it was real fun because you know so i'm like oh god you know it's one in the morning i'm tired 

281.18 282.32 A: i know 

286.64 293.33 B: i'd been arguing with my husband i didn't have the baby in the car with me 'cause she was with my mom and i'm thinking 

293.44 297.22 B: oh shit just what i need 'cause you know we had no money 

297.27 301.50 B: been behind on our bills i'm like oh for pete's sake what am i gonna he's like 

301.31 314.59 B: he was really nice he he couldn't have been much older than me and it was with another sheriff there was two of 'em that pulled me over i'm thinking oh god this is you know they didn't have anything else it was a little bitty town you know in the middle of the night 

308.00 309.41 A: oh no 

313.72 314.97 A: right 

314.72 316.67 B: (( so he goes )) 

317.08 319.62 B: do you know why we pulled you over i'm thinking 

320.14 321.05 B: (( yes )) 

321.20 322.58 B: i was speeding 

323.27 324.29 B: he's like 

324.50 328.65 B: any particular reason why i said yeah i'm just trying to home to my husband he goes 

329.26 332.70 B: it's the middle of the night and you just weren't paying attention right 

333.22 345.53 B: yeah whatever floats your boat he goes i'll let you off this time just you know watch he said you know just watch your speed on up the road and have a good evening [laughter] yeah yeah 

340.66 341.83 A: oh wow 

342.19 343.67 A: you were lucky 

344.31 347.74 A: your heart was probably racing and then you get off scott free so 

346.03 351.75 B: oh god i thought i was gonna die right there and i i would have i would have 

350.07 352.47 A: you've never had to pay for a speeding ticket 

351.96 354.96 B: no that's the only time i've [laughter] ever been caught 

355.61 359.30 B: [laughter] yeah well i usually don't 

355.95 358.00 A: that's kind of lucky 

359.34 360.53 B: typically 

360.58 362.84 B: speed to that degree 

362.54 364.81 A: yeah most of the time you don't have to 

364.79 366.59 B: [laughter] no that was 

365.46 368.14 A: most situations it's not necessary at all 

367.74 374.34 B: that was so funny though i'm like hm there's no other way to say it and he was kind and i guess 

374.26 387.18 B: most people don't they try to talk around it even when they get caught there was no talking around that was dead singer so you know i guess in a situation when it just comes down to it if that's the way it is that's the way it is and you know 

387.24 389.54 B: it's just easier for me not to try to 

389.77 398.94 B: cover up for it just accept the consequences which ever it is and just go on you know whether it's a child or or a husband or something you know just 

392.18 393.71 A: i know i agree 

393.73 396.69 A: i agree i think accepting the consequences is 

399.30 403.70 B: [noise] you know it's it's just so much easier [laughter] than trying to lie about it you know 

400.20 401.34 A: yeah 

403.13 412.72 A: i know when i think about this situation of like bill clinton getting caught with the with the perjury i kind of feel like i wish he would have just told the truth because then he would have been more respected 

406.78 408.12 B: (( oh god )) 

412.42 413.56 B: (( oh god )) 

412.62 418.16 A: in some ways because i think the situation was worse because he lied about it as opposed to just being like 

417.88 418.88 B: yeah 

418.13 427.77 A: yes so what i'm like a stupid white man and i like slept around with my with this woman like who cares like the american public needs to learn to accept to like 

421.15 422.56 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

427.96 430.96 A: not every single human being is willing to be 

431.50 432.99 B: (( yeah )) 

431.59 434.80 A: you know s- so tied to their wife in that way or whatever 

434.43 442.17 B: but i think his things was just trying to lie blatantly about it when it was [noise] right there you know caught 

440.05 442.62 A: he was still yeah he was still caught 

442.63 444.32 B: [laughter] yeah 

443.62 447.83 A: i know he would have been so much more respectable if he would have just been honest 

447.29 450.95 B: that makes you wonder what else he lied about probably everything 

449.49 457.21 A: that's exactly it you know like that's how he lost the american public's trust is through that i think even less than the actual act itself 

457.06 460.81 B: (( hm yeah oh yeah yeah yeah )) 

457.27 458.96 A: well that's hard to say 

462.37 463.29 A: um 

463.54 464.31 B: (( hm hm )) 

463.70 468.72 A: but i don't know i never really actually paid that much attention to the trial or anything so i'm kind of talking 

467.07 469.92 B: oh god no i got better things to do than 

469.80 471.60 A: i know than care about 

471.04 472.64 B: deal with that i mean 

472.07 476.22 A: bill clinton's penis [laughter] 

473.92 474.59 B: yeah 

475.46 481.86 B: or anybody else's for that matter at this point i got other fish to fry around here that's 

478.02 479.38 A: yeah 

480.28 483.47 A: i'm sure what what kind of what kind of work do you do in florida 

482.95 484.29 B: i'm a home maker 

484.35 487.44 A: mm with your nine month old baby 

484.98 486.48 B: (( are you are )) 

487.04 488.56 B: yeah 

488.06 490.20 A: i'm sure that keeps you pretty busy i 

489.63 499.33 B: oh me yes yes my husband does food service he's food service management [noise] so that keeps us kind of on our toes time wise you know 

491.32 492.69 A: bet it does 

499.26 500.32 A: i bet 

499.38 503.44 B: but before i had her i did some stuff with g._m. ah 

504.57 513.67 B: i don't know how they did it they used like when you'd buy a car and they'd do their g._m. financing i guess your paperwork would go back to like the dealer or a special place 

513.53 527.16 B: well they opened up a thing in florida where all of the paperwork for that particular like the south east region or the north east region goes in this one building now instead of having to call this dealer or that dealer you know it's just all in one place 

527.36 541.45 B: so that's what we what we used to do was get all these files in and then when people would pay of their cars or trade 'em in or something um we would send out the titles so i would sign car titles that's interesting [laughter] you know 

527.78 528.71 A: oh wow 

538.80 540.67 A: oh yeah 

541.38 543.07 A: well yeah it is interesting 

542.86 543.92 B: (( well what do you )) 

543.05 558.02 A: that's amazing i actually just moved to new york city so i spend a lot of my time thinking about what people actually do with their lives [noise] because i'm like i'm totally unemployed looking for work and i'm like what does that person do what does that person do and it's kind of fascinating 

548.92 550.17 B: [laughter] 

557.74 558.63 B: yeah 

558.39 570.25 A: 'cause it's never like when you when you're growing up as a kid thinking oh i'm gonna grow up and i'm gonna be a fireman or i'm gonna be a teacher it's like one of these ten categories of wh- of career and but most people don't fit into that with their husbands i 

563.33 564.90 B: (( mhm )) 

569.41 571.40 B: oh there's just so many different 

571.90 573.51 B: things to do 

574.20 577.42 B: that you just kind of happen into a lot of times you know 

574.32 575.21 A: know 

576.81 578.14 A: exactly 

578.32 579.32 B: so 

578.76 582.49 A: all that really matters in the end is just kind of being a good person so 

582.64 586.18 B: mhm so what what do you wanting to do up there 

585.77 594.09 A: well i'm an i'm an artist i just graduated from college so i'm looking to work for artists and i was working for artists in the city until they 

594.11 595.89 A: stopped needing me 

595.70 597.27 B: ah hm yeah 

596.12 598.34 A: so now i'm kind of in between 

598.44 599.89 A: (( um in the limit ))
