174.25 175.23 B: um 

175.69 178.86 B: see i i really think um 

179.25 181.05 B: i really think that

189.15 190.29 A: mhm 

190.27 197.59 B: you know what i'm saying instead of lying and saying oh well you know something to saves somebody's life 

197.17 198.30 A: mhm 

198.49 213.25 B: that's what i'm think- you know if what i had to say is it gonna save somebody's life [mn] but the bible tells me that a lie is a sin and i shouldn't be doing that and i have to rely 

208.88 209.76 A: correct 

213.20 217.12 B: on [mn] that god's gonna take care of me 

217.19 218.57 A: and that person 

217.56 222.30 B: in whatever situation lying is not the answer 

223.08 225.85 A: [mn] yeah i mean i [mn] i really [mn] 

226.02 230.31 A: that is a very very good question it's a good study that they're doing because 

228.96 232.65 B: i- it's tou- it's tough to stick to your guns 

231.76 233.20 A: mhm 

232.95 237.65 B: you know 'cause there's certain situations where [mn] 

237.64 241.93 B: maybe a lie might help save someone's life 

241.30 242.37 A: mhm 

241.69 256.45 B: but that's not g- what god wants us to do god wants us to stick to the ten commandments and [mn] see that's what i've chosen to do now jennifer [mn] because i'm really a christian 

251.70 252.87 A: mhm 

256.39 259.61 B: person and i really do follow 

260.22 261.60 A: what the word is 

260.74 262.77 B: what the bible tells me 

263.18 267.39 B: as much as i mean i do occasionally sin 

267.03 268.19 A: mhm 

267.54 272.30 B: because i am a sinner obviously i'm human but 

270.65 271.63 A: mhm 

272.49 274.40 B: really 

274.46 279.16 B: [lipsmack] i've put my hand my life in god's hands 

279.54 284.23 B: [mn] and i'd rely on god to take care of me

314.88 316.07 B: [laughter] 

318.40 325.94 A: um i i know that it's it's gonna be something hard gr- you know as they grow up that's another thing when it comes to 

326.28 328.44 A: [mn] my children as as 

328.54 330.93 A: much as i myself

335.30 336.28 B: (( [noise] right )) 

341.34 345.28 A: my first response is yes i would lie for my family 

345.29 347.33 A: um but i i 

348.07 351.55 A: that's what stops me you know i- i- [sigh] 

351.78 358.93 A: it's tough you know 'cause i know when i was growing up and [lipsmack] um you know 

359.08 361.04 A: the way my mother raised me 

361.54 375.50 A: was a little off although sh- you know she was christian she also raised me to stand by your family one hundred percent and you know [mn] it's hard because like you said you know the bible says thou shalt not lie but 

365.96 367.36 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

368.59 370.05 B: (( right [noise] )) 

375.68 377.35 A: on the other hand 

377.60 388.65 A: [mn] your f- you know your family is so important and you know one thing that you know if i would get in trouble with school or or something like that you know she 

388.84 392.21 A: would lie or or cover for me 

392.15 404.52 A: or whatever 'cause she knew i was a good girl and there had to be a reason behind it you know and then she'd pull me aside you know and then she'd talk to me about it later and yes she would you know discipline me or or do whatever she had to do but 

396.52 397.72 B: right 

404.60 407.20 A: to keep me i guess 

408.09 409.23 A: [mn] from 

409.47 412.55 A: you know getting in trouble with school or or 

412.89 414.86 A: anything else that [lipsmack] 

414.98 421.19 A: you know like i said she'd defend me first and then and then she'd give me the discipline you know 

415.24 416.36 B: uh-huh 

420.38 422.79 B: right i got ya 

421.85 425.65 A: which i- it's it's hard you know 'cause it's still lying 

425.72 427.03 B: right [noise] 

425.96 428.22 A: you know but [lipsmack] 

428.20 430.98 B: [noise] see the thing is you can always 

428.44 430.65 A: i appreciated it as a child 

431.12 441.01 B: [noise] like rationalize almost anything so the thing is [noise] it's kinda like at some point in your life [noise] 

441.75 444.00 B: you know i could you know 

444.97 453.16 B: there's always a reason why you could do it you know [noise] 'cause once you start doing it [noise] you know it's 

448.29 449.39 A: (( [noise] mhm [mn] )) 

453.86 457.16 B: easier to keep on you know [noise] 

456.64 458.03 A: right 

457.70 462.98 B: i mean you know what i'm saying [noise] 'cause you got kids and all that so 

459.44 460.42 A: oh yeah 

463.30 465.00 A: yeah it is it's 

465.19 468.80 A: it's a difficult thing because i'd want to defend 'em to the end 

468.87 471.45 A: you know but then on the other hand it's 

471.57 474.84 A: [mn] you know a question of should you not lie so that 

471.86 472.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

475.11 476.26 A: they 

476.20 476.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

476.58 479.80 A: [mn] so that they learn the correct way and they don't learn to lie 

476.93 478.23 B: (( right [noise] )) 

480.09 481.27 A: you know 

480.93 482.83 B: right 

482.42 484.08 A: [lipsmack] but um 

484.87 491.42 A: yeah i mean i [mn] i would have to say unfortunately when it comes to things like what you said about you know saving somebody's life 

491.61 494.33 A: or or something along those lines 

494.67 498.15 A: that i would be the first to commit [laughter] that sin and to lie for them 

494.88 496.01 B: (( oh )) 

498.26 499.70 B: right 

498.74 499.94 A: you know 

501.15 502.17 A: (( [mn] um )) 

502.28 503.45 A: did you h- 

503.48 505.46 A: have you always been a christian 

505.40 507.17 B: (( right [noise] ah no )) 

506.77 507.64 A: no 

507.82 513.70 A: so like you said at that point in your life you would have lied but now that you now that you have 

510.44 512.43 B: [noise] oh sure 

513.11 516.61 B: [noise] and sometimes it's still hard not to 

516.03 517.26 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

517.71 521.74 B: you know [noise] that's one of [noise] the easiest things to do 

521.30 534.19 A: it is it's hard to draw the line you know because there are so many people that say well it's just a little white lie but it's not really 'cause it's still a lie [laughter] [laughter] you know 

529.74 532.89 B: right oh i know believe me
