222.31 224.09 A: that's a good sport 

223.53 233.10 B: yeah it's not bad you know what's uh really big on the east coast here is um lacrosse i don't know if that's gone up by you guys but i mean that blew up over here like it's like the new rage

248.44 249.41 A: yeah 

248.80 254.04 B: and uh it's it's kind of like a hockey but but you know the ball is obviously passed in the air 

253.74 254.57 A: yeah 

253.90 263.92 B: and uh you know you have a goalie i think it's like six guys on each side or nine guys and yeah just you know like like any other sport with a goal except it's just with this particular stick

363.49 367.11 B: mhm mhm yeah 

366.19 370.85 A: but um it's quite an interesting thing here the these surveys isn't it 

370.30 376.31 B: yeah yeah exactly i think w- what is this one exactly about i think how you speak and where you're from or something like that 

375.82 378.93 A: [mn] i don't know i really don't know to be honest with you 

377.73 381.01 B: [laughter] yeah yeah 

379.06 384.72 A: uh it's pretty interesting they got different topics i don't know have you been on any different calls 

384.32 388.14 B: yeah the other one i was on was uh something about september eleventh 

388.26 391.40 A: yeah i had one kind of like that and 

391.46 394.90 A: what's the other one on security in airports was one 

394.72 395.82 B: oh yeah 

395.20 397.53 A: i'm not sure about the rest of them but 

397.48 399.70 B: yeah um 

398.38 400.28 A: it's kind of a neat thing 

400.07 407.34 B: yeah that's that's the one handy thing around here like you know s- q- quick money doing these like surveys and sorts of things like that a 

407.01 408.21 A: yeah 

407.68 410.46 B: little uh a little beer money on the side you know [laughter] 

409.65 411.42 A: oh heck yeah that's good 

411.25 425.57 A: i used to do it uh when i lived in san diego there were these couple of companies they did all kinds of different surveys you go in and they'd show you like beer commercials and things like that and you'd you'll give them your opinion and they give you twenty bucks or something for half an hour or whatever 

424.05 425.45 B: yeah 

425.39 427.01 A: that's kind of a cool thing 

425.49 426.75 B: that that's 

426.86 429.23 B: yeah not not not too hard work you know 

428.79 431.79 A: [laughter] no no i can do that a lot [laughter] 

429.40 431.02 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

431.07 434.06 B: exactly here's my opinion thanks [laughter] 

433.34 437.27 A: yeah yeah no problem but uh 

438.06 443.91 A: never ran into that up here but you got to be in a big city for that usually i think so [noise] 

441.48 444.30 B: yeah yeah definitely 

443.96 447.85 A: it's pretty interesting so what's the weather doing out there 

445.49 446.56 B: mhm 

447.63 461.16 B: uh it's finally gotten better we had probably had the worst winter we've ever had in history well like since i've since i've been living here so uh finally it's reached like sixty degrees on a consistent basis so we're doing uh doing a little bit better how about how about you guys 

454.20 455.10 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

460.40 474.11 A: cool well uh it was fairly nice the last couple of weeks but the last few days it's been rainy and cold ready to be anywhere trying to get ball season going you know and [laughter] it's nasty but hopefully tomorrow it'll be a little nicer so 

469.23 470.76 B: yeah exactly 

473.64 481.24 B: yeah i think uh the worst is probably over because i don't i can't imagine that this sort of weather that that winter can hang on much longer you know 

480.91 485.80 A: right right i'm you know winter's too long anyway man i can 

485.31 486.88 B: [laughter] 

486.94 491.05 B: yeah there there must be a little bit of shock like going from san diego to uh saint louis 

490.62 493.86 A: [laughter] yeah actually i'm up by minneapolis now yeah 

493.55 494.91 B: oh really wow 

493.95 500.42 A: [laughter] even worse [laughter] yeah it was quite a deal but um 

496.08 498.51 B: yeah that's crazy jeez 

500.55 503.23 A: oh well you go where the money takes you 

503.00 505.03 B: exactly exactly

507.11 508.94 A: so what are you going to school for 

508.65 521.69 B: uh advertising so yeah hopefully hopefully it works out i'm i'm not entirely sure like yeah i've been looking for jobs but the reality is that right now it's just a especially in advertising that's the first thing companies tend to cut you know 

510.26 511.17 A: oh yeah 

521.06 522.29 A: right right 

521.62 524.36 B: so they're really not hiring anybody so
