33.24 40.77 B: yeah it's that's about we could have a dog but um my husband's in the navy and he's currently deployed and we just moved so 

39.98 41.92 A: oh is he overseas over

48.78 49.98 B: yeah thank you 

50.38 52.04 A: um 

50.99 52.93 B: (( well what kind of fish do you have )) 

52.80 65.43 A: actually right now i just have oh god i ha- i've had varieties over the last couple of years i started off the first time i started off um having fish was um like twelve years ago i had gotten a whole bunch of african sicklers 

65.75 69.83 A: but the suckers get so big in the tank and they yeah i used to have um 

70.26 76.45 A: two fish that were just so big i just they were just dwarfing the tank so i had to get rid of them 

74.40 75.66 B: [laughter] 

76.14 78.43 B: do they grow to the size of the tank 

78.21 85.93 A: um the sicklers will grow to the size of the tank i remember when i was in college my roommate used to have ah two um 

86.33 90.88 A: oh what the heck were they called one was a jack dempsey the real big one um oh i forget 

89.99 91.65 B: like an oscar type 

91.14 92.81 A: the oscar yes thank you 

91.90 92.88 B: yeah okay 

92.99 95.59 A: um it was so big it was um 

96.05 99.68 A: but we had a huge tank in in our apartment at school 

99.82 103.33 A: um but the other tank we had was a piranha and i always wanted to get a piranha 

103.07 104.90 B: [laughter] 

103.99 110.76 A: they are they're so cool to watch but they are very timid when they're they're single they get very aggressive when there's more than one 

108.29 109.28 B: (( oh )) 

110.65 112.04 B: oh that's interesting 

111.95 114.09 A: yeah so if you have one 

114.48 118.31 A: it's perfect because you can play with it stick your hand in it and the fish won't attack you 

118.45 119.71 B: (( oh wow )) 

118.56 120.39 A: but two in a tank 

120.20 121.31 B: forget it 

120.75 122.09 A: forget it 

121.48 132.64 B: i didn't know that that's i just assumed that they were all piranhas you know they all had that instinct to them so it it must be a kind of hunting type thing or a packed animal 

132.17 138.11 A: i would imagine so i mean i don't really know much about piranhas i never studied them but i just remember that ah 

138.30 144.74 A: even he said that ah and i talked to people who have had piranhas in the past and they have all said the same thing you get one 

144.67 158.52 A: they're fine you get two they're they're pretty bad even with one unless unless it's a fish that's smaller if you get a size fish that's as large or larger than a piranha you can have the two in the tank together and they'll they'll coexist 

158.22 159.14 B: huh 

158.99 164.24 A: but if you put a piranha in a tank and you put like a goldfish or whatever the piranha hunter's can eat the goldfish 

163.72 165.03 B: sure [laughter] 

164.48 166.23 A: we used to put mice in it [laughter] 

165.99 167.72 B: oh my gosh [laughter] 

167.05 174.96 A: [laughter] and as soon as the piranha hits it and draws blood then the piranha just loses it's like um a shark it smells blood it goes nuts 

173.62 175.63 B: right right 

175.88 181.73 B: do th- and was it the typical like you hear like you know they can clean a cow off in you know a couple of minutes or something 

181.37 192.36 A: oh i imagine as a as a pack of piranha they can yeah but um as individuals i don't think they can my roommate came home one night and he used to sit there and stick his hand in it and play with it 

184.83 185.90 B: yeah 

188.57 189.40 B: (( okay )) 

191.77 193.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

192.56 198.09 A: i'm like you're nuts his name was bill johnson and then back to the day there was a skier was named bill johnson 

198.16 201.55 A: his nickname was wild bill he won this olympic gold medal in the downhill 

201.48 202.54 B: oh wow 

202.10 205.63 A: so we we tagged our roommate's name wild bill [laughter] 

204.92 207.86 B: [laughter] well yeah sticking his hand in the piranha tank 

207.12 208.71 A: he was retarded 

208.33 210.53 B: we just have a little um 

210.63 217.03 B: ah i think you'd call a japanese goldfish he is the kind that's got the big huge eyeballs that look like they are popping out of his head and 

212.63 213.86 A: oh yeah 

214.81 215.89 A: yeah 

216.65 218.05 A: they're neat looking 

217.47 222.27 B: yeah and he's actually pretty funny he does tricks and stuff i i don't know how 

222.13 233.90 B: maybe it's coincidence but you can go up to the ca- or up to his ah tank and like tap on the top of it and he'll do flips he'll like flip over and flip around at first we thought he was just screwing around and then 

233.72 242.46 B: every time if you go up there and you tap on th- on the top of it he'll come up and then do little flips and swim away and [laughter] and if he wants more food 

242.43 249.15 B: he comes up to the top and like hits his tail you know like a shark or a dolphin might do or something or a um 

248.09 248.87 A: (( mhm )) 

249.19 256.89 B: but you know he comes up and he and he flaps the water and then if you feed him more he'll behave but if you don't give him food he'll just keep doing it until you feed him so 

256.73 257.94 A: no kidding 

257.59 269.14 B: yeah he's quite entertaining but i think he's going to be one that grows to the size of the tank because we bought him just at walmart and he was like two dollars or something and he was little biddy and now 

269.18 276.81 B: he's in a um about a three gallon tank just one of those small ones and he's really almost too big for the tank so we are gonna 

275.98 288.13 A: [noise] well you know what kind of fish they are those are because i have friend of mine who does aquariums outdoor aquariums those are japanese goldfish they actually are bred to be put in those big outdoor tanks 

287.69 289.03 B: oh like a koi 

288.69 289.71 A: yes 

289.35 292.98 B: 'cause see i thought they may be related to a koi bu- 

292.22 299.04 A: they are but the thing about the difference between a koi and those kind of goldfish is a koi i'm watching my two kissing fish now kiss 

298.48 300.13 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] [noise] )) 

299.42 302.21 A: i'm sitting here cra- cracking up they're both kissing each other 

301.63 303.25 B: [laughter] 

302.53 310.90 A: the bigger one chases the little one around the tank i guess they're one's a male and one's a female and now they're the female's hiding inside a little log and the male's kissing her 

310.33 312.14 B: [laughter] 

310.98 312.47 A: it's hysterical 

312.82 314.43 A: (( oh how cute )) 

313.90 315.77 B: [laughter] that is pretty funny 

315.42 322.86 A: but i am i have a client that that that like loves these things and she has those kois and she said the one thing about a koi is that 

322.95 329.14 A: you ca- you don't have to ever take them outta the tank during the wintertime they'll freeze in a block of ice 

329.24 332.59 A: and then when the weather changes and the water starts thawing again 

332.85 334.58 A: they'll start coming back to life 

334.34 335.69 B: really 

335.11 341.29 A: they have ther- they have um some kind of insulator that they put in that they they start 

342.03 343.60 A: um i guess 

344.08 354.61 A: by instinct they start generating this this like ah um like a radiator fluid type of a thing and it it it keeps their body from freezing completely during the winter time 

345.31 346.18 B: yeah 

354.03 356.35 B: wow like antifreeze in their blood or something 

355.54 361.61 A: yeah and they can they can literally freeze their body through the whole summ- through the whole wintertime in a block of ice 

359.64 360.73 B: wow 

361.93 367.96 A: and then when the weather starts changing and the water starts warming up they they're fine they come back to life again 

365.46 366.48 B: they're fine 

367.59 374.41 B: that's re- well my parents have um a huge koi pond but they live in louisiana so it never gets that cold yeah 

372.36 375.99 A: it never gets cold down there right so they live they live twenty four seven they 

375.38 389.91 B: yeah so they're fine you know every once in a while like a every couple of years it'll get pretty cold like i think about two years ago they had some snow but it only lasted a day or two and you know they just went out there and kept stirring it up to make sure it didn't freeze but they were fine 

388.55 390.44 A: don't have to worry about it and 

389.85 394.72 B: yeah that's inter- i'll have to tell them that 'cause i i don't think they know not that they have the problem but [laughter] 

394.09 408.93 A: they can go on the internet and check it and read about 'em but um i know that this woman that i talk to she loves her fish and she's like she said the only problem is that in the wintertime these fish will what they do is they all group up in the middle of the tank and they live like a and also it looks like a ball of fish 

396.12 397.25 B: yeah 

408.34 409.76 B: oh wow 

409.15 412.62 A: and they all sit there and and survive through the wintertime 

411.22 416.52 B: so you don't feed them or anything like that cause they're they're in ice so she doesn't have to feed 'em or 

413.28 414.07 A: huh 

415.92 419.46 A: she doesn't do anything they're dormant they're just laying there 

418.81 421.10 B: like a bear that's really interesting 

419.53 420.38 A: yeah 

421.05 428.30 A: i was floored when i heard that and it's like there's only a couple of different animals in the country or in the world tha- that will do that and one of them is a fish 

422.83 423.95 B: yeah 

427.93 430.46 B: where um where does she live 

430.02 432.59 A: we live up up in ah pennsylvania 

432.01 434.79 B: oh okay oh yeah then it definitely gets cold enough 

434.18 438.63 A: yeah i i actually live up right up by the philadelphia and that's where we live that's where the my client lives 

438.15 452.60 B: well we just moved here i'm in northern or southern virginia norfolk but we just moved here from ah hawaii we lived on the island of kawai and they have all the resorts there and you know huge huge koi ponds and 

442.76 444.38 A: (( ah love norfolk )) 

451.66 458.76 A: yeah well you suckers had your ah we were supposed to go to kawai for our honeymoon and you suckers had your hurricane at the time and they closed our island down 

458.19 460.51 B: oh was that when the aneke came through 

460.11 461.50 A: yep 

460.90 462.51 B: um we um 

462.05 463.58 A: that was like eleven years ago 

463.11 472.14 B: yeah yeah we lived there for about two years ah my husband was stationed at pacific mussel range and um but they had these just humongous 

472.23 483.66 B: ah koi ponds that i would say one of them took an acre cause it just went over the whole property the hyatt and they had these gigantic koi i mean these things were probably 

478.93 480.22 A: holy crap 

483.77 487.18 B: oh i don't know five six seven eight pounds probably 

486.74 489.99 A: well you know what koi are they are just they are just carp 

488.23 489.17 B: no 

489.84 491.24 B: (( oh are they really )) 

490.66 493.14 A: that's all that's all goldfish are goldfish are carp 

492.98 494.48 B: i didn't know that 

494.04 495.60 A: yeah i mean i 

494.80 496.85 B: they're expensive [laughter] 

496.14 505.73 A: yeah they're very expensive i guess they bre- they're like anything they're bred to be a certain level but um they're just plain old good old carp that you can get in a river [laughter] 

500.34 501.55 B: right 

505.13 510.20 B: wow i didn't realize that well it's like here in virginia we um fish and 

510.27 519.14 B: we we go out in the chesapeake bay and we fish for um blue fish ususally but we wind up catching all these stupid croakers and croakers are horrible they're trash fish 

518.98 527.87 B: i was in the store the other day in farm fresh and they were selling croakers [laughter] i thought oh my gosh [laughter] [laughter] who would want to buy that but people were buying 'em ah 

524.64 525.76 A: ooh 

527.47 531.97 A: the people like i grew up in upstate pennsylvania up in the pocano mountains 

531.42 532.26 B: (( ah )) 

532.33 539.24 A: and up through there you know we have the susquehanna river if you are familiar with that and it is a pretty 

539.38 546.21 A: it's a pretty blucky river 'cause of all the coal mines that have run their sulphur into the water so it makes it really yucky 

543.53 544.49 B: right 

546.28 558.80 A: the only thing that really lives in the water now is carp and people are up there and you're and you'll see carp five six seven feet long and people will catch them and they'll eat them but it's the it's a it's a trash fish 

558.37 560.92 B: yeah like a croaker yeah 

559.80 565.15 A: yep just like a croaker yeah i know what croakers are but yeah it's it's a trash fish and it's disgusting 

564.95 566.52 B: and the people are eating them yeah 

565.79 571.13 A: and the people are eating them so like you know if you've got your goldfish in the water you're basically looking at a carp 

571.00 573.92 B: [laughter] that's really interesting i i didn't know that 

573.53 575.99 A: and that's why they're so cheap they breed easily 

575.52 589.16 B: yeah 'cause we bought ours at walmart like i say it was about two dollars or so but i know when my parents bought the koi to put in their pond and they bought the small ones um they were very expensive i i off the top of my head i don't remember exactly how much but 

589.09 594.18 B: i think the big one that they bought that was like the breeding one or something was a couple of hundred bucks 

593.71 595.07 A: oh really 

594.43 599.89 B: yeah and i think it was like guaranteed to breed or guaranteed to have offspring that were
