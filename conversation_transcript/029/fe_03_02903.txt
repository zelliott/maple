97.19 98.10 A: oh 

97.36 99.76 B: and the person was in [sigh] 

99.82 107.45 B: i think colorado [noise] and then my husband did it once [noise] and that person was in [noise] california [noise] 

107.48 109.64 A: yes i had somebody from texas 

109.15 111.86 B: [noise] what was that 

109.76 110.90 A: last time 

111.63 116.12 A: so i've only done it one other time that [noise] i've been home and available for 

116.13 123.91 B: yeah well honestly the first time they ever called they called my husband and i the same night like about an hour apart 

116.57 118.11 A: [noise] these studies so 

124.06 132.56 B: and the topic was not one and he didn't know that they had called when they called me and i didn't take it because 

133.08 138.34 B: [noise] not here nicole i'm sorry hang on one second not here here okay up there um 

135.16 135.98 A: (( okay )) 

138.71 144.53 B: that [noise] i guess i wasn't comfortable with the topic so i didn't accept it and then an hour later they called him 

144.70 155.56 B: and h- he was like in a [noise] different part of the house or something so he didn't [noise] know that i had gotten called and that i didn't accept it [noise] and it turns out that it was the same topic and he also wasn't comfortable with it 

155.41 166.91 B: so he also turned it down [noise] and it was like and then we compared notes and we were like oh that is so funny that neither one of us was comfortable with that topic [noise] then the next i think it was like [noise] two days later 

163.31 167.60 A: (( yeah )) 

167.67 173.68 B: [noise] again we both got called on the same night again it was the same t- [noise] it wasn't the same topic as the first night but again 

173.85 180.43 B: [noise] whatever topic was his was mine so it must've been the topic for the night and we both on that one felt comfortable so we both 

180.59 186.00 B: [noise] um conversed and that was back in [noise] the beginning of march [noise] [noise] 

184.78 199.15 A: yeah the first time i think i i declined it because i didn't like the topics and the second time i accepted it and then i couldn't find my pin number so i hadn't called in or anything and i'm thinking okay you know they'll probably never call me again and [laughter] 

187.84 189.64 B: [noise] right 

193.43 194.67 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

195.46 196.03 B: (( [noise] )) 

197.57 200.88 B: [noise] well actually i think if i 

201.17 205.60 B: [noise] remember correctly [noise] i think there was a problem [noise] 

205.66 216.01 B: they had stopped making calls for a while because of whatever the problem was [noise] jessica it's time to start calming down okay it's getting late um 

205.73 207.05 A: mhm 

211.25 214.30 A: (( yeah )) 

216.24 217.92 B: and what happened was 

216.51 217.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

218.09 224.38 B: i guess like we hadn't heard in a while and then i enquired [noise] as i called i called [noise] the eight hundred number 

224.36 226.95 B: and i said um gee you know 

226.86 230.90 B: we only had gotten called twice [noise] the first time and we had turned it down 

230.79 241.45 B: um we haven't gotten paid or anything you know what's you know what's going on [noise] and they'd explained that they had stopped making calls for a while [noise] and that you would get paid after your third 

241.23 246.86 B: call and i says oh so then it hasn't ended [noise] 'cause like a month had gone by and they said no it hadn't ended 

246.92 254.81 B: and they said you know so after you get your third [noise] call they will well then the other day on the internet i get a message that they were 

254.73 265.81 B: [noise] they were looking more for males so i then i then [noise] resubmitted my husband's information [noise] and so just now when my daughter [noise] handed me the phone 

257.84 258.69 A: oh 

261.59 262.43 A: (( uh-huh )) 

265.76 273.78 B: i said no don't don't be handing it to me [noise] this is for your father he's participating now [noise] i figured you know like my [noise] that i was done 

273.33 274.16 A: right 

273.62 284.93 B: [noise] because it's been [noise] so long to let you know [noise] the time that i did [noise] participate was back in the beginning of march [noise] and my daughter says no mom it they specifically said your name [noise] so i was like okay hand it to me then 

285.00 292.50 B: [noise] in the meantime here they had told me you wouldn't get paid until after your third call [noise] and what comes in today's mail 

292.51 304.95 B: but a ch- uh two separate checks [noise] one for him and one for me [noise] so go figure i so i you know i don't even know any more [noise] and then last week he and i what was that what was that 

295.36 296.46 A: [laughter] 

300.72 303.42 A: nice surprise [laughter] 

303.99 307.15 A: nice surprise [laughter] 

304.90 309.69 B: yeah and then last week we both [noise] he and i also jess off to bed 

309.77 315.28 B: jess off to bed last week we both got called [noise] and we thought [noise] 

315.76 327.19 B: a- and it turned out like the person was saying something about this is so and so for a survey [noise] but we knew it wasn't this survey [noise] because this one does that automated thing first [noise] you know like the mechanical 

327.17 340.08 B: [noise] caller with the telling you to press the options and um [noise] and so this this thing just it just happened to be a [noise] fluke think that right after they had asked for the men [noise] and i resubmitted 

331.32 332.19 A: right 

340.42 341.47 B: um 

341.30 345.77 B: [noise] these other places were calling for a survey [noise] something about [noise] like because we're about 

345.55 356.84 B: an hour an hour and a half north of new york city [noise] they're trying to get people like to answer questions [noise] about whether people are still [noise] going into manhattan [noise] after the nine eleven thing 

354.53 355.60 A: oh 

356.60 357.57 A: right 

356.70 360.92 B: [noise] are they still going in [noise] are they still sight seeing [noise] are they still shopping 

360.93 364.69 B: you know it was one of those kind of surveys [noise] so it had nothing to do with [noise] 

362.85 364.62 A: yeah 

365.07 373.87 B: this study at all [noise] and at first i was [noise] thinking that they did [noise] well i think we've gotten off the topic here [laughter] [laughter] [noise] 

368.78 370.20 A: right 

370.65 371.92 A: i think we have too 

372.38 376.00 A: [laughter] anyway except for baseball [laughter] 

374.21 377.32 B: so how so how are the mariners doing 

377.71 382.38 A: actually they're not doing too bad yankees are doing a lot better but [laughter]
