32.22 33.20 B: right 

33.89 43.72 A: i would say that that's kinda hard for me um i'm sort of like i first of all i'm a philadelphia fan so i and i i basically i'm interested in every sport that uh 

43.82 52.37 A: that the philadelphia tea- that that that uh is in philadelphia and uh of course i was actually i was watching the flyers tonight and unfortunately 

51.35 53.42 B: did they win is ottawa out 

52.83 56.74 A: yeah no ottawa yeah ottawa won the series they beat 'em so 

56.28 57.96 B: oh i'm sorry to hear it 

57.17 63.42 A: that's all right i won't be watching hockey any more for well i'll probably watch uh you know the stanley cup finals but uh 

59.30 60.37 B: [laughter] 

63.41 65.92 A: i mean i i usually get around i i 

65.76 79.31 A: you know obviously it depends a lot on how my team's doing i mean if the if the baseball team's doing real well i'll watch a lot of baseball if they're not i'll you know i'm not watching baseball same thing with hockey basketball i mean there's fixtures 

79.12 83.29 A: fortunately right now even though the flyers are out the sixers are still in it yet so 

84.12 85.49 A: um 

85.86 91.61 A: but uh yeah i mean that that's and as far as how many hours i spend watching it um 

92.09 95.08 A: that's hard to say i i mean usually there's 

95.32 105.92 A: a game on if if if if my team's in the playoffs for instance they're usually playing every other night so i'll be watching probably about maybe three hours every other night during the week 

105.69 106.42 B: mm 

107.63 114.43 B: um well i don't i'm not a really big sports fan except for hockey hockey is is the only sport that i'm really into 

113.80 115.12 A: mhm 

114.48 121.61 B: and um my favorite team is the capitals and i don't have cable so [laughter] being on the west coast i never get to see them 

118.84 122.90 A: oh man [laughter] boy this is a really hard one for you then 

122.51 127.07 B: yeah but um especially since um the the the fir the uh 

127.26 137.69 B: playoffs started with hockey i've been watching a lot more so maybe i don't know five or six hours a week and just whatever i can and then go out like to the bars and maybe watch those ones that aren't on network television 

130.28 131.31 A: mhm 

137.30 138.64 A: mhm 

138.04 143.61 B: um other than that god i don't think i watch anything maybe some figure skating [laughter] i don't know if that counts 

142.85 145.64 A: oh yeah well hey that's yeah that's a sport yep [noise] 

145.40 150.37 B: so like the olympics maybe but other than that um oh what was that beep does that mean something 

149.70 153.44 A: oh that was that was my volume button i i was just turning it up a little bit 

153.16 154.17 B: (( oh okay )) 

154.31 155.34 B: um 

155.46 160.42 B: so yeah i don't know what else to say um do you know how long we have to talk or 

159.79 161.69 A: i think we have ten minutes 

161.58 162.98 B: okay [laughter] 

162.33 170.75 A: so i guess we can just yeah try and i know i had this i've i've done a couple of these already and some of the topics are just i mean they're kinda silly it's like 

170.60 180.14 A: how are you how are you supposed to get ten minutes out of it but you kinda just go on about whatever and once once the they they warn you when it's ten minutes and uh 

181.30 184.97 A: so um yeah i'm trying to think here of uh 

185.14 190.20 A: another t._v. sport that well one one thing is every now and then i'll watch soccer 

190.31 195.09 A: i don't kno- when like when the world cup is going on and whatnot on t._v. um 

195.02 206.05 A: it's it's always fun to watch that every now and then especially like i i get kick out of the the uh announcers sometimes how when they score a goal and everything they go crazy and everything i just find that really funny 

204.35 205.28 B: yeah 

206.37 209.02 A: so i'll i'll watch soccer every now and then 

208.95 217.49 B: well that sounds cool and and also you get kinda what i like about the olympics is you get to see other countries and most most stuff that we watch is all just domestic so i 

209.10 210.11 A: um 

214.49 216.02 A: exactly yeah 

216.12 225.27 A: mhm yeah the olympics are are a great thing to watch too as well it's a shame that there isn't more international um you know sports on t._v. 

225.07 231.75 A: more coverage of them um because yeah i just i like that whole thing where you have all the different countries competing against each other 

226.37 227.27 B: right 

233.97 235.52 B: mm so are you a student 

235.23 241.43 A: yeah i- i'm a i'm a sophomore at penn state right now i'm actually it's it's finals week so uh 

241.45 246.11 A: i'm getting ready to uh get outta here i'll leaving uh in um on wednesday 

246.19 247.63 B: that sounds good 

246.99 253.97 A: to go home i my hometown is in um allen- around allentown p._a. which is in east central pennsylvania 

253.29 254.98 B: so you're not too far from home mm 

254.95 259.99 A: no it's it's probably about an hour and fifteen an hour and thirty minutes north of philly 

263.09 265.54 B: and uh then do you watch like college sports or 

263.22 264.28 A: and uh 

265.19 266.43 A: what's that 

265.85 269.58 B: i was just wondering if you watched college sports or something just trying to think of other things 

268.09 279.16 A: oh yeah well penn state i mean we're big on football here so that's one thing i i'm actually i go to the games because obviously i'm here and then i'm also part of the uh the marching band 

279.24 286.28 A: so i mean i'm whenever we have a home game i'm i'm down on the field so sometimes i get on t._v. myself but uh 

282.90 284.35 B: (( that that sounds really )) 

286.78 287.87 A: um 

288.73 290.45 A: uh let's see 

289.51 294.54 B: yeah i went to george washington university so our basketball team get a lot of coverage yeah 

292.76 293.81 A: oh yeah 

293.86 295.67 A: mhm yep 

296.24 300.11 B: [laughter] i have nothing to say about this i'm so sorry 

299.29 304.74 A: i know hey that's all right i'm kind of you know drawing a blank right now myself i really don't know 

304.91 309.62 A: i mean i guess we've been on here for probably close to five minutes now so 

309.85 313.76 A: we'll see or hopefully we can get something out in another five minutes yet 

314.20 315.53 A: um 

315.52 322.75 B: well say you're on the east coast so do you i mean the other hockey scores from tonight do you know or did you just watch the flyers game and that was 

322.08 332.00 A: well i i you know i [sigh] it's hard to say um i'm sort of one of those that's like you know i just like my team and i really don't like anybody else 

331.37 332.40 B: [laughter] 

331.94 337.24 A: and especially the team that beats my team i don't like to see them do good in the rest of the playoffs so 

336.40 337.94 B: i'm the same way 

337.57 338.81 A: [laughter] 

338.20 348.71 B: i was so glad new jersey just um just knocked camper bay out of out of the playoffs and camper bay who uh who beat washington so i was very happy to see that even though i don't have any 

341.74 343.03 A: mhm 

347.28 358.51 A: yeah exactly yeah i'm looking i hope that i mean the flyers have had some tough battles against jersey in in the finals in past years and unfortunately jersey's gotten the uh 

358.39 365.49 A: better end of the stick but uh you know i i i'd like to see i'm actually gonna be cheering for them to be ottawa in the finals 

363.66 364.36 B: [laughter] 

366.10 380.63 A: so i probably won't watch much of that series but uh you know yeah when the final when the stanley cup final comes i'll probably watch and so that'll probably be a good again they they they play the playoff games every other night so a good three hours every other night probably 

380.43 391.16 B: do you if when that comes on whether it'll be 'cause i know that a._b._c. has started um broadcasting all the saturday games you know when the when the finals start do you think that will be on network t._v. or just on cable 

389.89 397.58 A: um it's i've heard yeah that's that's a good question um because most of the playoff games are on um 

397.61 404.86 A: e._s._p._n. and whatnot during the week um whether they'll be on a._b._c. during the week now for that or or not i'm not sure 

398.40 400.07 B: or like fox sport 

404.94 405.98 A: um 

406.66 414.60 A: they they very well could be on a._b._c. i th- i know a._b._c. is tied in with e._s._p._n. and i mean e._s._p._n. is is the 

413.93 415.39 B: and it's all disney 

414.72 416.98 A: yeah so 

416.05 418.73 B: yeah that would be really cool i would love to watch more 

418.73 420.24 A: mhm 

419.57 422.65 B: but not you huh the flyers are out so it's all over 

421.66 423.13 A: exactly 

423.48 429.89 A: but yeah hockey is just be- i mean that's that's probably one of my more favorite sports to watch on t._v. because it's so fast paced 

429.29 431.37 B: exactly you never get bored 

429.91 432.66 A: i mean it's back and forth constantly 

431.93 443.62 B: yeah that's what that's what i really like most other sports are so slow compared to like baseball and and football just seem to take forever and though even though hockey's just as long it doesn't feel that way right 

437.52 438.45 A: mhm 

439.56 440.72 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

443.01 449.17 A: exactly yeah probably the long the thing about hockey is they have the uh the fifteen minute intermissions 

449.18 453.75 A: i mean and a lot of that's due to the the television networks and whatnot so they can get in their 

452.62 453.51 B: yeah 

453.80 455.66 A: you know half time uh 

455.92 461.54 A: uh analys- game analysis and all that jazz and then they have the commercials and everything too so 

461.64 465.40 A: that's probably one of the big reasons why it goes as long as the other sports 

466.88 478.62 A: but uh yeah i mean baseball i at one time i was probably more of a baseball watcher just because that was that was the sport i used to play i didn't the only i i didn't play any other sport but baseball so 

478.84 489.05 A: back you know i i watched the philly's a lot more back in the early nineties and the mid nineties and they were of course and one year they went to the world series so i was watching them then 

489.79 490.83 A: but uh 

491.64 493.73 A: yeah i mean um 

494.06 501.76 A: i'll probably be watching more of the basketball playoffs right now too because of the fact that the sixers are still in it but uh [noise] 

501.16 504.01 B: yeah everybody out here is really pleased about the lakers 

503.97 509.01 A: what's tha- wh- oh yeah you guys have the lakers in the playoffs right now yeah 

509.79 520.70 B: i don't know southern california fan- fans seem to be really fickle though as long as their team is doing well they're all excited about 'em but when they're not they just ignore 'em like this is the first really good season the mighty ducks have had 

520.19 521.15 A: mhm 

520.52 525.49 B: and you know all of a sudden all these people are coming out of the woodwork support them and it's kinda the same thing with the angels 

525.19 526.24 A: mhm 

525.63 530.65 B: and the end of you know the last baseball season when they you know i guess they won the world championship 

527.89 528.98 A: mhm 

529.88 534.61 A: right exactly yeah yeah that's right they anaheim won the world series so 

534.92 541.87 B: and before that i mean you'd see when when you watched games on t._v. and stuff the half empty stands because nobody cares you know unless we're you know 

540.38 541.39 A: mhm 

541.91 545.04 B: doing really well seems really fair weather fans out here 

542.76 543.69 A: mhm 

545.34 555.13 A: yeah i mean there's probably i would think that because of as of late with the lakers doing real well and the you know anaheim winning the world series there's probably maybe a increase in 

555.14 569.31 A: in people uh watching you know the california sports out there on t._v. because of that you know people they can't get to the games all the time you know people who have busy work schedules probably watch are probably watching a lot more now 

571.01 572.07 B: (( yeah and that's how they )) 

573.60 579.06 A: i think we're almost to ten minutes probably a c- probably a couple maybe like one or two more minutes yet 

574.98 575.62 B: [laughter] 

578.48 579.25 B: [laughter] 

580.44 583.78 B: i feel so bad that i'm just drawing a total blank [laughter] 

582.97 584.97 A: hey that's all right 

584.74 587.39 B: what the other topics that you've that you've had to do 

587.27 593.98 A: well the other one actually i got two calls on it was the um uh something about the wor- the world trade center 

594.20 599.96 A: um and the nine eleven thing uh and it was basically asking how did that did that change
