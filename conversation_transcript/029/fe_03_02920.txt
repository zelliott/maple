32.40 38.02 B: yeah base baseball's a bit hard to watch on t._v. it's more something you go to the ballpark to watch 

36.98 45.26 A: yeah well uh maybe if i watch baseball i don't sit there and watch the whole game you know i watch it a little bit unless something exciting's going on i'll fli-

60.31 61.69 B: exactly 

61.70 68.75 B: yeah it it hasn't caught on as much united states as much as you know up in canada or or european places but i hope

95.80 97.09 A: sporting 

97.06 109.08 A: uh team for dallas now and and uh you know if you'd have told me that a few years ago i'd have thought nah nobody'll ever watch hockey i mean you know they'd never even seen ice what would they want to watch hockey for [laughter] 

106.83 110.57 B: right yeah [laughter] about hundred degrees in there how're you going to put ice in 

109.01 123.87 A: yeah i mean you know you know but it's really caught on i mean it's uh uh and and when they brought the team in i thought nah you know that's not going to last [laughter] yeah but i mean i thought it wouldn't last just because there wouldn't be enough people 

115.82 120.81 B: [laughter] yeah that's a good team it's a great team now they're playing really well 

124.08 136.29 A: you know locally to go to the games that really understood sport or cared about it or had ever played it or you know 'cause usually people i don't know about you but i mean you know i i like to watch sports that i'm you know that i play 

129.38 130.50 B: right 

135.81 137.29 B: oh yeah absolutely 

137.00 141.37 A: or uh you know or uh uh something like that so 

141.48 146.29 A: uh i didn't really think they would but uh who's your favorite hockey team 

145.71 148.73 B: i live in colorado so i'm an avalanche fan but [laughter] 

147.89 149.88 A: oh really yeah 

148.74 152.36 B: yeah did didn't turn out real well for them this season but 

151.65 158.30 A: well yeah but you know they're just kinda like uh uh the the texas teams you know they come and go 

157.90 159.46 B: yeah they do indeed [laughter] 

159.09 162.02 A: [laughter] so you know you just kinda got to 

162.18 171.85 A: uh stick with the guys that you know and see what goes on but i enjoy watching the hockey a little bit but i don't i don't really understand the game you know i didn't grow up playing it so 

170.55 177.76 B: yeah yeah you have to i mean there's a lot of rules involved and if you don't if you don't know know what's going on it it can get confusing pretty fast 

173.50 174.76 A: yeah 

176.87 182.72 A: well yeah but you know it's a game that's exciting just the same i mean you know it's uh it's uh 

180.24 181.53 B: right 

182.76 189.09 A: it's i think probably so- uh you know soccer is a harder game to watch if you don't understand the rules 

188.24 190.90 B: yeah it's really slow it's real i mean 

189.88 201.14 A: yeah well and you don't know why they're doing this or doing that but in hockey i mean you know it it kinda moves so fast that that there's enough excitement that you may not really understand why 

191.25 191.81 B: (( [mn] )) 

201.10 213.28 A: one time somebody got the penalty box and next time they didn't or that they've had a face off or something but it you don't really care 'cause it doesn't last long enough to distract you you know [laughter] you don't see [laughter] you're real busy watching the action again you know 

204.13 205.29 B: right 

208.92 212.23 B: exactly [laughter] yeah 

212.75 214.52 B: yeah they're right back to it 

213.87 215.99 A: yeah but uh 

216.10 218.29 A: anyway well um 

218.01 220.17 B: so you are you still living in texas right now 

219.60 225.88 A: yeah yeah i live in a little town called tyler texas it's about a hundred miles uh east of uh dallas 

225.57 228.01 B: so so you're a cowboys fan then 

227.61 230.59 A: uh yeah i like the cowboys i always have 

230.61 241.19 A: although i've kinda given up on 'em lately but uh [cough] [laughter] yeah i think i think they're in worse than that i don't know i mean you know they're uh but you know they 

232.78 235.33 B: yeah they're in the rebuilding phase it seems 

241.41 252.42 A: they the people around here you know we're so spoiled at having 'em win uh a playoff at least almost every year that they existed forever uh that you know if they don't win 

252.49 261.89 A: uh win a a wildcard or a playoff there they think they're really horrible and you think about some there's so many teams that you know struggle along and they 

257.34 258.47 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

262.27 270.68 A: uh you know they haven't won a a playoff game in years and they win one and people are big fans of 'em and follow 'em and keep up with 'em and all that kind of stuff but 

269.94 271.46 B: yeah 

271.62 275.32 A: uh i've got a uh uh son that lives in denver 

274.99 276.10 B: oh really

286.16 287.39 A: yeah 

288.38 291.52 A: do you really [laughter] yeah 

288.99 299.68 B: yeah i i don't play for the varsity team but i play on some skates down there and that's a great school man that's a my my uh grandpa used to be a professor there but 

293.37 294.91 A: yeah yeah 

299.01 300.45 A: is that right 

299.97 301.27 B: yeah 

300.47 303.12 A: yeah are were you born and raised in colorado 

302.52 304.50 B: i was born and raised in denver 

303.73 313.79 A: yeah well you've been there all your life well my son really loves uh snow skiing and uh things like that you know so he's really had a ball when he's while he's been up there you know 

312.79 315.06 B: [noise] yeah i bet it's a great great town 

314.61 315.79 A: yeah 

315.18 323.35 B: the guy the broncos are the broncos are kind of in the same the same boat as your uh your cowboys right now though they're kinda slumping off a little 

321.13 322.51 A: yeah they're kinda 

322.67 324.84 A: yeah they they well you know they 

324.78 339.06 A: they you have great players like those teams had you don't replace those guys easily i mean you know that just doesn't happen and when they changed the [sigh] you know they've got so much finance stuff in the salary caps and everything these guys you know they can't put together 

328.66 330.42 B: yeah 

339.03 345.65 A: these uh you know whoever's got the most money te- gets the best team deals anymore you know so 

343.79 348.19 B: right jerry jones has got a lot of money though so who knows 

346.85 353.20 A: yeah he does but i mean you know you can only spend so much of it doing one thing or another and i think he's made some pretty dumb 

349.88 351.30 B: yeah 

353.18 361.50 A: choices in the last few years well yeah i was kinda surprised with that too because i if nothing else i figured he would be a draw 

353.71 356.16 B: i can't believe he got rid of emmett smith 

361.44 369.41 A: for as long as he played just 'cause of the fans you know that he would be a good ticket draw i mean he's he's he's uh you know 

364.78 366.38 B: yeah exactly 

369.47 374.04 A: past his time i'm sure and he's not going to ever uh 

374.21 384.97 A: you know do anything on a consistent basis that's you know real fantastic but he he came through in the patches last last year when he needed to 

384.61 387.29 B: [noise] yeah he's he's proven himself for sure 

386.24 391.75 A: and i'd hate to think that i i mean i would hope that if i was his age i could 

391.58 392.38 A: you know 

392.22 400.66 A: be able to do something like that i know i wouldn't be able to you know i'd be wore out but uh he was lucky too i mean you know he he had a good career 

395.37 396.46 B: right 

400.62 410.95 A: to as long as he's played to not have any more uh damage you know in that position 'cause you know that's a pretty easily uh you know uh 

405.86 407.34 B: oh yeah 

411.10 414.95 A: uh those guys don't don't make it very long 

414.15 416.94 B: they take a take a lot of hits in the running back position 

416.57 418.58 A: yeah yeah 

417.45 424.10 B: so we've not got tyrell davis now one one of the best but but then he took that twenty a._c._l. and that was it for him so [noise] 

423.17 431.29 A: oh yeah well you know that's yeah that's a you know uh that's a a tough tough way to go 'cause i mean you know 

431.94 440.72 A: he's just kinda out with that deal but i think they get such good i i don't know what kind of contract he had but you know they those football players they they've got some agents that 

440.61 441.63 B: yeah 

440.68 451.38 A: you know some of 'em get paid wasn't it a bronco that play played that was real high pi- high pick and he not got wasn't it wasn't he didn't he i can't think of his name but i thought he played with the broncos that 

451.28 459.78 A: he played about three games and got hurt and he had a contract that said that they had to pay him whether he played or not yeah 

457.35 458.55 B: oh really 

458.67 460.39 B: a draft pick 

459.74 468.84 A: yeah so it's been a coup- it's been probably five years ago or something i think they better than that it may have not been with the broncos i don't know it might have been somebody else but 

462.96 465.33 B: oh i don't i don't remember that 

467.97 469.93 B: yeah there's been a couple of those 

469.62 479.23 A: but uh i thought now that's the kind of deal i need [laughter] i'd stub my toe i'd be hurt for life you know that'd be the end of it right there as long as just send me a cheque [laughter] 

472.26 473.59 B: yeah no kidding 

474.68 475.81 B: [laughter] 

477.47 486.64 B: you you got a guy like ryan lee who comes out and signs some huge contract i mean he can't play the position and you know gets passed round a little bit and still getting paid so 

482.64 483.74 A: yeah 

485.96 490.12 A: well yeah you know it's not a bad deal if you can pull it off i guess but 

489.41 494.05 B: so do do you get a lot of uh football coverage down there i mean do you get a lot of games or 

493.16 498.82 A: oh yeah we do i've got a satellite dish so i get you know pretty much whatever i want to watch 

497.81 501.65 B: do you do you buy that package that n._f._l. sunday ticket or whatever 

501.14 514.65 A: uh no i haven't as uh so far because i've had you know enough games where i you know things that i was really interested 'cause i'm not big on college bowl and uh except for the local schools and i get those anyway so 

510.26 511.33 B: uh-huh 

514.99 522.10 A: uh you know i think that package is really cool but you know you can't even watch all those games i mean you'd have you'd have 

519.99 522.90 B: yeah if you they're all on at the same time 

522.10 535.07 A: yeah [laughter] i mean you gotta to have you gotta have all kinds of recording equipment [laughter] if you want to see 'em all [laughter] [laughter] but uh how about you on the hockey games do you watch uh cable or or yeah 

525.75 528.78 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah exactly 

534.06 544.21 B: yeah i got a i got a dish as well and we're actually thinking about getting that uh they got a center ice deal it's like two hundred bucks for the whole season but i mean there's like a thousand hockey games so i mean 

543.20 552.54 A: yeah that's like trying to watch basketball or something i mean you'd never see them all but but if you got to see all the games you wanted to you know that were really important to you it'd probably be worth it [noise] 

545.24 546.63 B: right 

551.72 566.35 B: [mn] right yeah i think it it it'd be interesting to see just to kinda see you know to be able to follow teams like east coast teams that i don't i don't get to see out here except for like sports center you know you get to see one little clip but to actually follow a team like 

563.89 565.04 A: yeah 

566.22 571.20 B: you know ottawa senators or a team that you that no one really knows about out west so 

570.58 583.19 A: yeah well yeah and you could kinda keep an eye on the competition for your team too you know which if they uh if they get into the finals and stuff it's one of those teams that they're going to be playing uh at some point in time so yeah 

571.30 572.53 B: could be interesting 

575.06 576.38 B: exactly 

580.63 581.63 B: right 

582.45 592.49 B: is it but hockey's like the n._b._a. right now where where whoever comes out of the west has really got the the big dominant chance of winning it 'cause the the west has just hit a dominant conference but 

591.83 592.97 A: yeah 

592.72 596.99 B: but i mean yeah there there's a i might like a team that you just don't get to see so 

597.09 598.28 B: it'll be interesting 

598.64 599.89 B: but football you get to see
