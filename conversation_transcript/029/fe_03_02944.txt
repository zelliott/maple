67.03 69.01 B: and so i would watch 

69.08 70.67 B: basketball then 

70.79 76.72 B: and i still occasionally watch a little bit of baseball on t._v. 

76.37 84.21 A: mhm i do like i do watch a little bit of baseball on television especially when david jesters plays um [lipsmack] i will watch

117.80 131.73 A: now i um i i'm in indianapolis indiana so we just um pacers just went to the finals i don't like n._c._a. ball as much because i feel college ball has more heart but i was watching the play offs with the celtics uh with the pacers

142.78 150.86 B: but i'll tell you there's not a whole lot for me to say about sports [laughter] [laughter] it's going to be a long ten minutes [laughter] 

145.52 147.62 A: about the celtic yeah 

148.05 148.93 A: (( now )) 

149.88 155.59 A: um i i i do like seeing some of the coverages of the boston marathon 

155.08 156.11 B: uh-huh 

155.71 162.69 A: and the different uh marathons um this weekend we had the five hundred the five hundred uh mini marathon 

157.84 158.88 B: mhm 

162.22 163.31 B: yeah 

162.73 167.17 A: and that was really sp- it was neat to see i watched the whole hour and a half of that coverage [lipsmack] 

166.42 168.95 B: oh wow yeah 

167.57 173.45 A: um it was they have the elite runners of course which finished the uh track in less than an hour 

172.86 173.87 B: uh-huh 

173.52 175.42 A: of thirteen miles 

174.73 182.46 B: yeah well you know i i do enjoy track and i i will watch that occasionally just about the only time i watch sports 

183.05 186.38 B: on a regular basis is during the olympics 

185.79 187.40 A: oh yeah yeah 

186.57 191.36 B: yeah and then it's then it's somehow it's fascinating to me then 

191.02 194.16 A: 'cause amateur sports have much more heart 

193.55 197.25 B: it you think so is it just because it's not about the money then 

194.47 196.50 A: i i i believe that 

196.75 197.78 A: uh-huh 

197.39 198.35 B: yeah 

197.96 201.19 A: it's about just their achieving their personal best 

200.56 203.06 B: right yeah yeah 

201.96 205.83 A: and so i do like amateur sports or college sports much better 

205.30 208.95 B: well did you know that they are going to start 

209.21 212.81 B: referring to ballroom dancing as professional sports 

212.12 217.78 A: and i agree i think it needs to be it's a it's hard work though they are ath- they are athletes 

215.01 216.25 B: it is 

217.20 222.11 B: and it is fascinat- it's no less fascinating to watch than ice skating 

221.66 222.70 A: mhm 

222.75 223.72 B: yeah 

222.79 233.23 A: yes it is and they um were airing some [lipsmack] pu- public television stations were airing the um uh ballroom and the latin dance championships 

231.39 232.55 B: uh-huh 

232.62 236.19 B: oh the latin dancing is fabulous isn't it yeah 

234.38 239.22 A: yeah the it is they they it and it and i they deserve to be a sport 

238.00 238.84 B: (( mm you [noise] )) 

239.87 251.08 B: find it really heartening to think that they're going to classify dance as a sport because there was certainly a time when people thought that dancing was just kind of effeminate 

244.91 246.00 A: mhm 

250.68 251.84 A: mhm 

251.85 256.80 B: and now it's considered a sport and it is a sport you're absolutely right it 

255.64 267.72 A: it is it it takes athleticism dedication um mm and grace and they've got to practice yeah and then they always try to go above and beyond what they've you know done before 

257.85 259.77 B: yeah and grace 

260.65 261.59 B: yeah 

262.57 263.51 B: yeah 

267.12 278.72 B: yeah that's right you know i grew up in south eastern missouri and we had a football team that the coach made take dance classes dance classes and 

277.35 280.18 A: oh to help their balance and coordination 

278.77 282.03 B: exactly yeah [noise] yeah 

282.43 288.40 B: i thought that was very open minded [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

285.54 287.30 A: mhm mhm 

287.42 291.35 A: um and just like figure skaters'll take ballet and things like that 

289.99 291.10 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

291.20 292.39 B: yeah 

291.81 305.96 A: and then now um anymore you know they thought figure skating was effeminate but those male figure skaters are athletes they are conditioned well and then they um anybody that can do a mid air flip and land on some on ice skates [laughter] 

296.63 298.40 B: [noise] that's right [noise] 

298.91 300.44 B: (( yes they are [noise] )) 

302.78 303.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

303.42 304.35 B: yeah 

305.24 316.14 B: and you know that when they're not actually doing their um [noise] routine they're in a gym working out yeah [noise] taking good care of themselves yeah 

312.07 313.26 A: yeah 

314.59 315.75 A: mhm 

316.05 320.90 B: so do you ever cruise the channels and [noise] look for something like that on t._v. 

320.56 326.25 A: yeah like when the olympics are on of course you watch whatever co- coverage of the olympics are on any channel 

324.90 325.52 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

325.82 327.85 B: uh-huh yeah [noise] 

326.42 327.53 A: um 

327.60 329.44 A: and just like with um 

329.89 337.65 A: and with figure skating if that is on um i will watch it just 'cause it um and those are those are fun sports 

334.28 335.72 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

336.99 338.31 B: yeah 

337.84 339.89 A: and any swimming events 

340.00 344.94 B: oh swimming too huh how about uh golf will you watch golf 

344.38 351.46 A: [mn] no i i will watch golf occasionally just to see how tiger is faring uh but other than that no [laughter] 

348.55 349.59 B: uh-huh 

350.62 354.57 B: yeah i think it's pretty boring [laughter] how about tennis 

352.14 359.43 A: yes yes and just like tennis is and bow- and bowling too i think those are boring sports to watch on television 

357.91 361.18 B: yeah i absolutely agree yeah 

359.95 368.43 A: and now they're airing pool as a sport you know pool has always been a sport but they're airing it on e._s._p._n. and i'll laugh at that when i see that 

362.64 363.90 B: (( oh are they )) 

367.86 371.69 B: yeah i i guess i do consider it a skill 

371.24 372.51 A: mhm 

371.89 379.74 B: but not one i possess but [laughter] but yeah uh i not really a sport i mean you don't have to you 

373.37 375.51 A: right [laughter] 

379.83 383.45 B: you can be three hundred pounds with a giant beer belly and 

382.31 387.72 A: and then do bow- and and do pool yeah uh-huh and bowling yeah 

384.52 386.25 B: yeah yeah yeah 

387.12 393.72 B: which just goes to show that they will put anything on t._v. [laughter] 

389.94 391.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

392.77 395.70 A: now the kentucky derby was aired yesterday 

395.18 402.22 B: oh that's right i missed that oh i agree well anything that has horses in it is worth watching 

395.92 398.90 A: so that was fascinating yeah that was fascinating 

401.63 403.29 A: mhm mhm 

402.36 408.13 B: [laughter] from westerns to sports the um yeah i enjoy that too
