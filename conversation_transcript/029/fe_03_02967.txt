6.26 7.96 A: hi karen how are you 

7.57 12.24 B: doing good well what about sports do you watch a lot of them 

11.87 20.70 A: [laughter] [laughter] i don't i i i barely have a t._v. i mean [laughter] i get channel seven so and i didn't you know even if i did i wouldn't watch sports on t._v. really unless 

15.94 16.61 B: oh 

20.71 23.23 A: i was with somebody who was watching them what about you 

23.02 31.72 B: yeah no i don't e- even my husband doesn't watch them so the only ones i like are the g- olympics and i love to watch ice skating so 

29.19 30.12 A: yeah 

30.76 32.80 A: yeah me too [laughter] 

32.03 35.86 B: yeah when that stuff comes on i like it and if there 

34.82 36.17 A: and gymnastics 

35.98 45.59 B: yeah if there's any kind of um like the uh finals or anything like in basketball if my home team is in it then i'll watch that but 

36.65 37.23 A: (( mhm )) 

45.92 49.73 B: other than that i don't watch we don't watch any sports 

49.26 60.67 A: yeah i d- i mean i don't either i [mn] i d- like i said i only watch it if the person i'm with were watching you know and i uh soccer was pretty much something that the my ex boyfriend watched a lot so i was i would watch that but 

60.74 61.74 A: um 

62.32 71.85 A: the thing is i d- i actually don't like the way they talk on the sports show they drive me bonkers the way that they i feel like people are constantly yelling at me and i just can't handle that so 

71.81 75.46 B: right and it's and it's just a constant chatter 

75.02 76.21 A: mhm 

75.53 84.23 B: it doesn't even stop even when they're doing like the ice skating one sometimes you have to just turn off the sound because it just i'm just like okay be quiet for a minute 

80.60 82.51 A: i know 

83.52 88.50 A: [laughter] which is part of the reason why i didn't mind watching the soccer so much 'cause they were actually um 

88.29 100.58 A: you know if it was like a british league or something it would be the british commentary and they don't do that they just shut up if there's nothing all that particular going on you know they'll they'll just name the people that the ball is passed to you know and i thought that was so much better 

95.58 96.59 B: right 

98.86 99.77 B: (( b- all right )) 

100.25 105.03 B: right well i mean like if you want every little move you can you go listen to the radio 

100.87 101.75 A: so 

105.42 107.74 B: you know but if you watching it 

105.54 107.44 A: yeah i know 

107.47 112.62 A: i know [laughter] you don't really need the play by play when you're watching it right there [laughter] 

110.40 111.00 B: (( mm )) 

111.35 119.41 B: no no you don't you know mainly i look at the big the big games like you know the superbowl or stuff just for all the hype 

112.79 113.76 A: so 

119.24 121.55 A: right exactly yeah 

120.15 132.81 B: but as far as entertainment uh there's too much other stuff going on and i'm like you i don't have uh just the basic i don't even have cable we just have the regular channels so we're not going to take any of the e._s._p._n. or none of that 

128.05 129.25 A: right me too 

132.51 133.46 A: right 

132.66 135.90 B: so and i'm real thankful my husband doesn't p- 

135.06 137.14 A: (( oh i don't uh [laughter] i know )) 

135.98 142.98 B: you know 'cause i know some that i mean it's a- it's constant and it's all the time and it's like you know i- i- 

142.08 144.99 A: that's the thing i mean if you you know 

145.03 151.68 A: are dating somebody that that watches sports it's always on there is always something to watch 

151.17 152.36 B: right 

151.87 154.78 A: and and i had it's so tedious to me but 

154.02 164.92 B: right you know like i don't mind it every so often or even if it's the home team of like football or basketball or whatever so it can just goes to that season you know but 

157.46 158.32 A: mhm 

160.99 162.04 A: mhm 

163.28 164.67 A: right right 

164.89 173.09 B: it's most people it seems like it's it's fanatical you know it's like every sport that comes on [noise] it's every all the time 

169.13 169.80 A: (( i )) 

169.95 170.64 A: (( know )) 

173.05 174.11 A: i hear you 

173.17 174.30 B: (( you know )) 

174.35 176.15 B: so and it's kind [mn] 

175.15 187.02 A: i i just i don't i mean i- it's funny though because i think they're boring i don't see what's so intriguing about them but at the same time my ex boyfriend he he didn't see what was so interesting about things like sitcom for him 

187.11 193.19 A: the the real the realness of sports made it much more interesting than anything else so 

192.56 202.58 B: exactly that's funny that you mention that because my husband when we were first married he could not stand sitcoms he likes just you know p._b._s. and all those kinds of things 

200.61 201.48 A: right 

201.65 203.00 A: yeah 

202.50 214.55 B: a- because he couldn't stand sitcom 'cause you know i don't know i guess he was the same way didn't see the use in it and that's so funny that you used that that uh uh example because that's exactly the way he uh s- 

207.74 209.53 A: [laughter] 

213.83 215.05 A: that's funny 

214.80 223.35 B: i know i guess he's gone to the nature type of channels and the scientific channel and stuff instead of the sports and all of that that wouldn't 

219.15 219.99 A: right 

221.66 224.63 A: i ge- yeah i know i guess it's the same sort of idea huh 

224.04 238.48 B: yeah yeah well i've got sports people in my family you know and my dad loves them and my nephew he plays all the games you know and then i've got a brother-in-law but it's just never something that's filtered down to me i mean i've got 

224.76 226.51 A: oh that's interesting 

238.56 241.48 B: i like to go to games like 

240.42 242.00 A: [noise] yeah me too 

241.52 248.46 B: if the kids the niece and nephew and my when my daughter when she was in high school playing volleyball loved to go to all that 

248.14 249.00 A: right 

248.82 252.84 B: but on t._v. and then in the sports and then 

253.19 260.71 B: i don't know it's gotten to be where it's kind of like show business it's it's more like it's a hollywood thing instead of just a real 

257.18 258.74 A: it is 

260.24 261.55 A: yeah 

261.06 264.00 B: like the sports you see when you go see the kids play 

263.39 265.56 A: i agree yeah you know and i mean 

264.57 265.57 B: yeah 

265.69 274.59 A: i enjoyed going to baseball games with my with my dad you know when i was a kid and all of that other stuff and i i like going to games to watch them live too but 

270.51 271.66 B: yeah 

274.91 278.21 A: i i guess maybe 'cause i don't have to listen to all that talk i just it's 

277.55 290.65 B: right well plus i like going to the live games even if it's the professional games because of the venue you know like w- i'm down here in houston and so we had the astrodome and i loved going just to see it 

284.44 285.33 A: yeah 

285.37 286.22 A: yeah 

289.41 291.62 A: yeah that's true huh [laughter] 

290.88 298.87 B: yeah and now we've got a new stadium so it's the big thing so you know i go just for that kind of stuff you know it's like a show 

295.78 297.67 A: right [laughter] 

298.53 301.15 A: right [laughter] that's so true yeah 

299.88 304.83 B: and on t._v. i'm like oh i just can't stand it it's just non stop you know 

304.39 314.74 A: right well i d- yeah i i just there you know i guess the other thing is that if i go to a game i can people watch too you know once i get bored with the game i can just kind of look around at 

305.17 306.22 B: anyway 

314.18 317.49 B: oh most definitely oh yeah 

315.07 318.33 A: [laughter] so i don't get to do that sitting at home in front of my t._v. 

317.92 322.40 B: yeah and oh yeah i love doing that anyway watching the people you know 

321.47 323.05 A: right right 

322.25 334.35 B: that are watching it and you can uh you get caught caught up in the game you know when you're there live and everything 'cause they got the little cheerleader or the or the person that's in the outfit you know whatever their mascot is you know 

326.85 327.80 A: yeah 

333.35 334.96 A: right right 

334.24 345.27 B: and stuff like that so you know what we've been doing lately is going to the um uh we did it earlier in the year was going to the uh high school football games even though we don't have anybody in high school anymore 

344.98 346.53 A: oh really 

345.79 349.39 B: yeah we just go to the local ones and it's fun it's so much fun 

349.51 358.22 B: yeah 'cause you you really do that you watch the people and you can watch the game and you're right there and then the half time is fun you know [laughter] all of that's fun 

353.05 354.17 A: yeah 

355.82 357.69 A: right [laughter] 

358.11 361.98 A: well it's probably considerably cheaper than going to a real football game now that it's 

358.42 359.22 B: so 

361.18 366.09 B: oh yeah most definitely i mean we sit right on the front too you know we just love it 

361.99 363.52 A: like the entertainment industry 

365.90 367.01 A: that's cool 

366.15 371.44 B: yeah yeah we like to do different things like that and that is some of the types of stuff we do but 

371.52 375.18 B: as far as on t._v. i think that's just for 

375.34 376.77 B: i don't know i guess 

377.79 381.20 B: hard core sports people or something [laughter] 

378.92 379.91 A: i guess 

380.05 387.86 A: but so many people get into it i i really i mean my friend has gotten into football which blows me away 'cause we you know 

382.39 383.60 B: yeah 

387.98 395.72 A: she doesn't seem like um the kind of person that would get into it but i just i don't know how they can especially since you spend so much time waiting for something to happen 

395.66 396.59 B: right 

396.68 397.45 A: so 

397.21 410.48 B: exactly and it is just like they run up and down and then they just in football it drives me nuts you know i'm like why don't they throw it every time because when they don't when they try to run they just end up in a pile [laughter] 

402.03 403.05 A: yeah i 

404.08 405.66 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] i know )) 

407.91 411.81 A: [laughter] nothing much happens [mn] it 

410.93 420.64 B: and i know it's a lot more to it than that i mean i understand that but it just looks that way it looks like you know you're not going to get anywhere you just you just all end up in a pile 

416.06 417.45 A: does you're right 

417.63 419.50 A: (( [laughter] it does [mn] )) 

420.06 423.71 A: yeah you think oh god they've only gone five yards you know and 

422.83 430.35 B: exactly exactly and i tell you the that's the thing watching baseball on t._v. is even worse 

424.17 424.99 A: yeah 

429.61 431.65 A: yeah i know i know 

430.43 435.35 B: that's why i don't mind going out to the live moment on t._v. it's just so slow 

433.77 436.07 A: (( i know )) 

436.28 450.86 B: and my nephew he does all the stats he loves all that he's got this thing with math yeah so i enjoy it if he's around or whatever because he'll be talking about all these people and what they're doing comparing them and everything you know that kind of makes it a little more interesting 

439.72 440.97 A: oh really 

448.56 449.40 A: yeah 

450.13 452.23 A: and you see that's true that does i mean 

452.31 460.67 A: i i i mind i don't mind watching the sports on t._v. as much when i've got somebody who's sitting there you know telling me some other interesting stuff about it you know it 

460.47 469.30 B: yeah like i always enjoy that if i go to my mom and dad's house if he's if we're if he's got something on he'll tell me well about this person or that person you know it is 

461.00 461.81 A: (( helps )) 

468.04 469.80 A: yeah yeah 

469.11 476.94 B: and so um and i guess that's part of it if you really get to know the players and the history and stuff maybe it's more interesting i just 

474.56 475.37 A: right 

475.48 478.85 A: right it's kind of like a a male soap opera or something [laughter] like that 

478.21 489.41 B: [laughter] exactly i just don't want to take the time you know i love the figure skating though i record that i have tivo and i told it anytime you do figure skating to record it 

480.02 480.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

481.31 482.99 A: [laughter] i know 

484.35 485.70 A: (( i do too )) 

488.55 490.83 A: i like that too um 

489.75 498.50 B: yeah so and i was just watching they had one last i think just this past weekend they had one from uh from hallmark anyway

506.75 508.27 A: i i'm not i [mn] 

508.38 516.92 A: i'm i'm more into the ice dancing you know what i mean i think that it i like watching it when it's really pretty yeah so the jumps don't really do all that much for me but um 

512.85 513.80 B: right

536.77 539.72 B: (( i saw that once too and it was very interesting )) 

537.90 538.64 A: (( [mn] )) 

539.20 540.82 A: (( it is [laughter] i )) 

540.03 547.63 B: it wasn't the cheer cheerleader uh much altered but [laughter] it was right totally different
