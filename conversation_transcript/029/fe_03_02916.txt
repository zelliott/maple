149.77 156.18 A: like that [laughter] are there are there any sports that like you absolutely just don't like like you just change the channel when

171.44 183.35 B: and i'll [laughter] stop uh believe it or not golf isn't too bad once i started at first it was like oh my god who the heck wants to watch these guys hitting around a ball and you know how boring is this but uh my friend's father 

183.53 194.41 B: uh he explained it to me and what not and everything looks like so perfect on the greens and it's really got like a lot of hills and valleys and stuff to it that you don't see because they all look like something off a postcard 

187.94 188.54 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

193.87 194.68 A: uh-huh 

194.33 205.08 B: you know and it looks like so smooth and everything i'm like how hard is that he's like oh no no it's the way they do it and blah blah blah and you know he explained it all to me and everything so that's kind of neat once you understand it you know 

204.33 206.10 A: oh cool yeah 

205.81 206.84 B: so because 

206.16 208.56 A: no i've never i don't think i've ever watched golf 

208.66 216.35 A: i kind of i guess my take on it was like you before like oh it's who wants to watch like a whole [laughter] bunch of people like hitting a ball [mn] i just don't 

214.96 219.23 B: yeah um i know what's the deal with that you know [mn] 

217.80 218.95 A: (( yeah )) 

219.42 222.16 B: [laughter] so do you um do you watch baseball at all 

222.47 228.70 A: um [lipsmack] no not really um i like i d- prefer to watch it in person like 

228.01 233.25 B: [noise] is it different i i would imagine maybe it's a little more energy to it or something 

229.23 229.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

232.89 236.99 A: yeah yeah yeah on t._v. i don't know you just don't get like the feel 

237.30 244.58 A: it just it's kind of boring on t._v. like basketball's a lot more like fast paced and it's like um you know the action kind of keeps 

244.76 253.32 A: on going but baseball's kind of slow of t._v. but in like when you actually watch it in person it's it's pretty fun 'cause there's like this w- you know it's like 

253.44 257.24 A: you have the hotdogs and you have the green and just it's like 

257.05 258.32 B: oh that's cool 

257.82 259.18 A: (( i know yeah )) 

258.98 264.05 B: you know and as uh see yeah i should probably go to a game sometime i hear you know everybody around here 

264.32 268.09 B: loving to go to the games [cough] excuse me [noise]

335.59 336.91 B: oh okay 

336.08 350.92 A: um yeah i haven't been living here too long but um probably like yeah i wondered like right now the mavericks are doing like really well so everyone's really behind them and there's like a lot of like basketball fever but other than that n- probably not out of the ordinary 

347.52 348.25 B: (( mm )) 

350.68 353.03 B: (( no not out of the ordinary yes but )) 

351.38 351.95 A: (( [mn] ))

407.54 413.82 B: oh my god it looked like these big curved net things but they're like made of plastic and they're whipping this ball at each other 

410.64 411.81 A: (( mhm )) 

413.93 421.35 B: it's like a a good sized ball i'd say it's probably like a little smaller than a than a uh like a basketball or something maybe

426.59 427.26 A: uh-huh 

426.79 439.95 B: but it's not super huge and they're like humming this thing at each other like a hundred miles an hour and they're trying to catch it in their hook thing and they're all you know they've all got like major coin men on them i'm sure they'd knock you for a loop if the ball ever hit you 

431.20 432.39 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] uh-huh )) 

440.02 450.47 B: it's probably made out of i don't even know what you know but it's it's just crazy and i i watched a little bit of it on t._v. i'd seen it surfing on like the e._s._p._n. or one of those channels you know and you go buy them

483.41 484.31 A: (( uh-huh [noise] ))
