295.39 300.13 B: well yeah i mean it's like you can watch it for like a minute or two then it all looks the same 

298.83 299.68 A: mhm 

300.24 309.10 A: yeah yeah that's true 'cause you're you're not really seeing the details of the cars and they're not like they're that different in color they're mostly white with some stuff written on it with their sponsors 

309.02 313.27 B: yeah especially they're going so fast you can't really you can't see 

309.36 310.18 A: so 

312.46 322.99 A: yeah it'd be different if every car was like one was purple one was aqua you know what i mean like they were very different colors you could be like i'm going for purple but no they're not but it must be something mm 

320.38 320.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

321.11 322.06 B: (( do you have any )) 

323.14 329.72 B: yeah i guess i see there's some kind of attraction in racing racing in general i think there's like a like a thrill 

327.42 328.41 A: yeah 

329.81 330.77 A: uh-huh 

330.10 336.76 B: sort of thing for people that are into it like i [mn] that's why like horse racing there's so much gambling and everything [noise] 

332.16 333.49 A: yeah yeah 

336.24 338.05 A: that's true that's true 

337.90 343.42 B: (( must be like something psychological about watching watching race i don't know that's what i think )) 

342.47 343.11 A: (( [laughter] )) 

343.70 344.87 A: maybe 

345.86 346.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

346.89 352.13 B: maybe i'm a psy- i'm a psych major so maybe uh maybe i'll do my thesis on that [laughter] 

351.25 356.03 A: yeah that sounds good [laughter] be a lot of people who want to know that you know [laughter] 

356.16 357.46 B: yeah [laughter] 

356.23 357.40 A: (( especially if you can )) 

357.64 366.70 A: especially if you could do it a co- a co- uh with uh by i guess urban venues or something urban cities 'cause like which one could support the market or not 

367.04 369.08 B: yeah ba- [laughter] basically 

367.06 367.78 A: (( you know )) 

370.26 370.99 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

372.71 373.42 B: (( so )) 

373.61 375.80 B: so back to the original question 

376.07 376.91 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

376.58 377.50 B: (( that's good )) 

376.92 382.94 A: more team sports i know and they got two people who are not really that big of a sports fan [laughter] but you know 

382.51 384.21 B: yeah [laughter] [noise] 

383.34 388.08 A: i answered the wrong que- question [laughter] well i do have to say this it was so funny um 

388.12 392.80 A: 'cause i'm in philadelphia you know it it's not a big uh college team you know 

392.67 403.33 A: uh city [mn] not one like penn state's the closest big i guess football and and and not very many people even follow that here so 

397.67 398.66 B: (( high penn )) 

398.71 400.85 B: (( u. penn yeah )) 

403.25 418.18 A: after the ohio state beat um the um university of florida i'm all like or university of miami the hurricanes i'm all psyched i go to work the next morning i went did you see that game and blah blah blah and everybody's like oh that's nice they won and it was just it 

417.05 419.01 B: [laughter] 

418.38 432.93 A: was a really good game it was like double overtime you know the qua- one of the players got i think the quarterback got hurt one of the hurricanes and you know the hurricanes have like they're the most winningest team i think in college football history 

420.08 420.82 B: [noise] 

432.72 436.99 A: like it it's ridiculous and ohio state you know was undefeated but 

437.43 446.17 A: you know in terms of stats they couldn't compare and then for them to win at like in double overtime and then college ov- overtime is different from 

437.57 438.13 B: (( [noise] )) 

443.55 444.14 B: (( [mn] )) 

446.17 447.13 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

446.85 452.89 A: pro overtime and it was it was just a good game [laughter] i was like you know you could you might not have 

451.38 452.55 B: (( yeah and don't )) 

453.04 458.62 A: [laughter] you didn't have to be into football to like that game it was just you know that exciting but 

458.58 465.16 B: [mn] yeah well that's like the new york teams is that like some of them are real exciting like the nicks 

461.61 462.54 A: uh-huh 

465.07 474.12 B: they they always have bad records and they never make it too far but most of their games go down in like the last sixty seconds of the game 

468.52 469.84 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

473.86 476.11 A: (( really [laughter] [mn] so you'll )) 

474.93 478.66 B: yeah like yeah they'll be winning by thirty five points 

476.35 477.87 A: (( watch it to the end )) 

478.28 480.03 A: oh no 

478.82 490.02 B: and then and then lose you know by two points to end or or the other way they'll be losing by thirty points and come back in a minute they're just like they're an exciting team 'cause you never know what's going to happen 

485.77 487.53 A: [laughter] 

489.91 497.47 A: yeah yeah and that that's mostly what you pay for i think 'cause i guess the people who foot the lakers would beg to differ 'cause 

496.81 498.82 B: (( yeah )) 

497.58 502.34 A: you know they they oh 'cause just like pretty they handle a game usually but 

502.47 508.16 A: you know it is nice to have like some excitement to the game 'cause if after that if they're winning by that much 

502.55 503.31 B: (( yeah )) 

508.12 519.28 A: and you know that they're not going to if they're not a team that can lose and you know the last half or the last twenty min- or last ten minutes you go home early 'cause it's not worth watching 

518.16 523.40 B: right yeah it's something you know like when you go to like the yankees you just know that they're going to win 

519.52 520.32 A: (( so )) 

523.42 525.58 B: that you know you may as well not even come 

525.67 533.08 A: yeah yeah i was going to say new york is such a baseball town i guess mostly 'cause the didn't the yankees and the mets have that subway um 

525.99 527.60 B: (( you know stay at home watch they )) 

532.68 536.94 B: (( had yeah coupla years back they had the subway series yeah )) 

533.99 535.19 A: yeah 

535.72 542.62 A: and everybody was like is anybo- is the rest of the country going to watch i don't know if they did or not i didn't but [laughter] 

541.08 544.06 B: [mn] [laughter] so the rest of the country didn't care right 

543.86 554.61 A: yeah i was going to say you know if anything is like the worst series to have it's that you know i don't know what could be besides like what the cubs and white sox are they in the same city yeah chicago 

549.09 549.97 B: (( yeah )) 

553.17 555.81 B: [noise] um yeah chicago yeah 

555.16 561.26 A: yeah i'm like that but i think i think they're in different divisions too or different leagues so that could happen presumably happen 

559.79 563.38 B: yeah well the yankees well the yankees and mets are [mn] yeah 

563.31 568.91 A: yeah so i mean that would the same equivalent like who would care you know 

563.61 564.55 B: (( i think chic- )) 

566.98 572.62 B: right right yeah well new yorkers care [laughter] you know [noise] 

571.55 578.32 A: new york well new yorkers care and new york is a a quite it's a huge i guess 'cause you probably get people from northern new jersey to go too 

578.34 580.76 A: 'cause does new jersey does it have a baseball 

578.52 580.47 B: (( yeah sure that's right because )) 

580.92 584.53 B: no they don't have any any they have a basketball team and they have um 

584.67 586.77 B: they have uh a hockey team [noise] 

586.74 588.06 A: (( uh-huh they do )) 

586.89 591.51 B: and actually the two the two new york football teams are located in new jersey 

591.42 596.87 A: oh are they really see i thought the the jets were new jersey they're new york jets 

592.92 594.25 B: yeah 

596.60 599.51 B: yeah new york jets but they're located in jersey 

599.10 599.95 A: oh
