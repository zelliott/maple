61.68 62.69 A: um 

63.08 64.25 A: we um

77.01 80.25 A: yeah it was syracuse that's who we lost to 

78.05 79.29 B: syracuse 

79.49 84.12 B: i think we lost in the elite heat to somebody 

83.88 87.04 A: kentucky has a pretty good team though normally 

86.79 88.27 B: yeah we 

87.11 89.65 A: i mean we've been knocked out by 

89.69 91.29 A: kentucky before 

91.13 92.86 B: (( yeah )) 

91.56 94.46 A: and that's not a very pleasant experience [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

93.88 100.20 B: this year we were favorite to win we'd blown everyone out all year and then we just fell apart against 

100.11 102.07 A: and see kansas 

100.69 102.28 B: some 

102.23 103.28 A: um 

103.95 114.22 A: they didn't at first they didn't pick us to be a favorite in fact we were a number two seed and roy williams was a little disappointed because he thought we should be a number one 

113.64 115.53 B: (( [mn] right )) 

114.91 116.14 A: and uh 

116.40 118.27 A: but we um 

118.42 126.77 A: might not have won but you know the the big one but we went pretty far yeah really good performance i thought 

121.54 124.57 B: whatever respectable performance 

127.06 129.99 A: and uh it was it was sad to 

130.04 132.29 A: lose but it was even sadder 

132.34 138.30 A: that just weeks later that we found out that we were losing our coach too to north carolina 

135.93 137.79 B: right 

138.25 139.96 B: yeah 

138.78 140.64 A: so i hope they appreciate him 

140.25 142.39 B: [laughter] hopefully so 

142.08 144.97 A: but um so and so you're from kentucky 

144.48 145.74 B: yes 

145.20 146.36 A: oh okay 

146.70 148.09 A: [lipsmack] so um 

148.57 150.90 A: how did how did you go about getting 

152.03 153.40 A: (( ju- um )) 

154.20 159.29 A: [lipsmack] did did you get letters or something or you know like emails from the survey place to 

158.39 165.99 B: um i'm actually a linguistic student myself so i kind of um keep up with things in the linguistic community and uh 

165.96 173.54 B: a friend of mine was actually trying to get um who does computational linguistics was trying to get everyone she knew to um 

173.69 175.33 B: take this so 

175.06 176.32 A: (( oh that neat )) 

175.59 177.75 B: sounded like a good idea what about you 

177.67 184.02 A: well i just um i don't i think i found it on a board or something and i emailed them or 

184.37 190.07 A: something or i signed up for it and then i've caught have you is this your first call or have you done it before 

189.34 192.36 B: uh this is my second i did it once before 

191.86 195.13 A: right i've had a call i've done it one other time too 

195.14 197.59 A: and um a lot of times 

197.91 200.61 A: i've i think i've missed a couple because 

200.83 203.62 A: when it first did it then it um 

204.07 206.50 A: i didn't know what was going on so 

206.07 218.23 B: yeah it can be kind of confusing when you first pick it up what it is a- and th- before they change the system you had to get your pin number so you have to scramble for the pin number that you wrote down somewhere and 

207.79 210.25 A: and then you hang up before you know what's going 

215.03 222.00 A: [laughter] yeah yeah so uh i guess we should stay on the topic i guess about 

220.75 225.41 B: oh yeah so how how much did you watch uh basketball when it was on 

224.03 229.00 A: it's oh i'm big k._u. fan i watch i have watched basketball 

229.11 235.62 A: um i started watching actually i didn't you know i'm from new orleans and uh well i'm not from new orleans but i've lived here 

235.90 237.10 A: for uh 

237.13 243.92 A: t- twenty f- almost twenty seven years twenty six years [lipsmack] and um i became 

240.82 242.55 B: mhm 

243.98 255.66 A: more involved in the basketball um probably about twenty years ago well no not no um probably more like fifteen years ago 'bout when r- roy started when roy was the coach 

255.22 256.96 B: mhm 

255.70 258.73 A: and he'd been coaching probably a year or two 

259.08 261.95 A: and uh we had larry keane no 

263.00 265.70 A: no not larry keane bird 

265.11 269.81 B: bird yeah yeah [laughter] i don't know if larry keane would be a good basketball player [laughter] 

265.94 268.34 A: larry bird [laughter] two two different 

268.98 278.43 A: no [laughter] anyway larry bird was before but i never watched him coach i didn't even know who he was until i'd seen him on t._v. 

278.02 279.86 B: right 

278.88 289.95 A: but um yeah i just i got involved watch you know listening because i worked you know the late shift at work and everybody would bring in radios and stuff and 

286.79 288.75 B: right 

289.93 297.25 A: so i started listening to it and then i just i don't know i just hooked because they were just so you know so good 

295.81 297.01 B: easy to do 

297.68 299.74 A: and um as far as football 

300.22 302.36 A: i never was into football 

302.25 308.81 B: it yeah it's not nearly as elegant to the sport i think uh people running into each other not terribly interesting 

309.21 316.95 A: um i just never could understand the game i mean uh the the chiefs are a really good team and 

317.12 330.91 A: my daughter loves watching the chiefs play but i just you know when if they go you know into the play offs or something then i watch a little bit of it but uh and then the superbowl 

327.57 329.00 B: right 

330.97 333.45 A: i watch it only for the commercials 

333.21 336.43 B: yeah i think that's what most people do actually [laughter] 

333.77 335.38 A: [laughter] 

336.19 339.03 A: and so is there any like um 

339.90 343.25 A: um professional basketball teams that you 

342.90 344.89 B: not really um 

343.29 344.18 A: follow 

344.42 347.79 A: yeah me neither i li- i j- i like college basketball 

347.32 361.92 B: and especially in kentucky i mean basketball here dominates everything like dur- during the n._c._a. tournament the schools pretty much stop you just whenever a game comes on classes stop and people watch them people are obsessed by it yes 

359.49 365.00 A: that's just that's exactly the way new orleans is exactly well of course you know 

365.23 366.22 A: (( um )) 

367.03 372.08 A: you know this is the place where it's supposed to beware of the fog you know fog allen 

372.76 373.76 A: um 

374.26 375.72 A: was uh um 

376.14 378.92 A: the one that brought basketball to 

379.21 382.03 A: k._u. and everything and so um 

380.18 381.93 B: mhm 

382.47 386.86 A: yeah it's pretty big we're pretty big on basketball here and that's all everybody 

387.02 390.34 A: talks about now i don't know it might be a little bit different 

390.00 391.87 B: yeah that's pretty much 

390.37 391.41 A: story 

391.61 395.24 A: this year with bill self we got him from um 

395.93 399.51 A: i don't even know where he came from [laughter] 

398.24 399.35 B: somewhere [laughter] 

399.54 401.44 A: s- well he was um 

401.53 404.54 A: a coach for alabama maybe 

404.34 405.53 B: that sounds 

406.18 414.85 B: yeah of course our firm did really horrible last year but i don't i don't know if their coach might have left them or i'm not sure what happened 

407.20 407.77 A: (( [mn] )) 

413.29 415.01 A: well he was horrible 

415.05 420.66 A: then um no wait a minute he's the one that got fired didn't he see there's been so much going on 

418.79 420.62 B: yeah 

420.85 429.88 A: on t._v. about different coaches getting fired and everything i'm getting the schools mixed up yeah it wasn't him then [laughter] 

424.22 425.95 B: hard to keep it straight 

428.61 432.86 B: [laughter] yeah i didn't think anybody would hire somebody who'd just been fired from somewhere else 

431.07 434.54 A: no he was the one that he was the one that um 

435.65 442.70 A: [noise] the alabama coach was the one that was caught like in an [sigh] partying or something with yeah okay okay um 

439.27 441.19 B: yeah yeah that's it [mn] 

443.08 446.21 A: [noise] oh where did he come from then i have no idea 

446.76 450.02 A: illinois maybe or iowa no 

449.76 450.94 B: (( uh )) 

450.47 457.03 A: i don't know but anyway so you know but everybody's you know welcoming him you know and um 

456.38 458.26 B: right 

457.50 463.64 A: but it's kind of curious that you know what it would be like if we played north carolina 

463.44 465.23 B: oh oh that i'm sure that would be 

463.82 469.39 A: and then beat them you know with roy being the coach [laughter] you know the uh 

468.70 470.59 B: right 

469.52 473.85 A: our ex coach so that would be a pretty interesting game if we ever got to play them 

473.58 477.54 B: yeah i i guess you all don't play them during the regular season 

474.51 475.44 A: (( and um )) 

477.01 478.61 A: no we don't 

477.80 488.00 B: oh 'cause if you do get to play them you'd probably beat them because i've heard they aren't very good at least they don't seem to have done very well the past few seasons they used to be quite uh good though 

484.49 485.98 A: (( [noise] [noise] hm )) 

488.24 490.01 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah um )) 

490.05 491.21 A: we um 

492.22 499.37 A: sometimes they they play some um pre games you know before you know the pre games before the tournament over the 

498.17 503.02 B: right the real season the regular season 

499.52 505.17 A: [lipsmack] what do you call it yeah the real season starts and some and roy used to um 

505.37 515.72 A: set up te- you know set up with certain schools you know that he wanted to play and so maybe you know there's just always that chance that that could happen you know 

512.38 514.07 B: that could happen 

515.77 520.31 A: in the pre season so [lipsmack] i don't know it would have been pretty interesting [laughter] 

519.87 532.64 B: yeah we have a big rivalry here because the person that used to be the coach at kentucky uh left for the n._b._a. and now he came back as the coach of our arch rivals in louisville just ninety miles away 

532.35 533.56 A: wow 

532.71 537.62 B: so that's a very interesting situation if they play each other every december 

537.67 539.74 B: um and it's always 

539.90 541.39 B: a huge 

542.22 543.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

542.34 543.35 B: (( deal )) 

544.48 556.25 A: yeah boy this is seems like a long ten minutes last time i did this we was talking about something that w- you know wasn't even of interest to me so much as the basketball is 

555.51 557.31 B: right 

556.10 562.94 A: and and i got talking to this person and it it you know we just kept talking next thing we knew the time was up 

562.58 564.43 B: yeah 

563.44 566.75 A: and so it's it's kind of weird 

565.76 568.69 B: yeah it's a kind of strange last 

567.16 569.15 A: so what time is it there 

568.78 575.36 B: here it is that's a good question it's eleven thirty five so i guess it's what a couple of hours earlier where you are 

572.10 573.39 A: oh okay 

574.46 581.22 A: just one just one hour yeah well you're up late then aren't you and i thought it was late for me getting a call 

575.69 576.89 B: just one hour 

578.88 579.86 B: (( i reckon )) 

580.66 585.42 B: [noise] well i'm a college student in finals weeks so uh the entire sort of um 

585.50 589.18 B: [lipsmack] sleep schedule and everything goes out the window [laughter] 

588.91 590.43 A: oh i see 

590.51 599.89 A: yeah my daughter she's uh she's going she's got finals she's got finals this week too and i think she said that tomorrow's her last day 

599.43 599.89 B: (( oh ))
