271.03 272.68 A: okay yeah 

271.37 280.22 B: um i watch baseball once in a while but uh not too often and i suppose it's as a spectator 

280.33 284.69 B: uh football and basketball feel to me like they're the most interesting 

284.78 285.79 A: yeah 

284.92 288.42 B: um i kind of once in a while i watch tennis 

288.72 292.00 B: uh that feels kind of interesting to me 

291.24 293.19 A: yeah 

292.10 295.67 B: i don't much like to watch uh soccer 

295.72 298.15 A: no i don't like that at all 

297.28 309.89 B: it feels too slow and usually the uh ability to follow it on a television set is kind of hard um they can't m- get the camera 

306.33 307.46 A: yeah 

309.92 318.24 B: action fast enough they you know they can't like zoom in on stuff quickly enough so the action always feels like its 

314.44 315.62 A: right 

318.37 320.29 B: in long shot 

320.02 321.06 A: right 

320.45 322.16 B: yeah so uh 

322.25 326.60 B: so i haven't i haven't drew gotten too interested in that

385.02 394.00 B: yeah yeah that's that's pretty much the thing that happens to me i tend to be more uh interested in 

394.41 395.72 B: uh 

396.37 411.25 B: the crowd responses to stuff so uh i guess i'm uh inclined to watch um you know like the superbowl more than regular football games because the crowd is usually so into it 

408.39 409.57 A: right 

410.66 413.89 A: right that's what i'm talking about yeah 

411.37 420.53 B: so it's just fi yeah if i get the sense that there's a lot of excitement um around the game then then i can get more interested in it 

415.57 416.72 A: yeah 

419.89 422.52 A: and i like rivalries you know 

421.07 430.99 B: i'm not like a hardcore not like a hardcore fan that like you know follows the team no matter whether they win or lose or anything like that i'm 

430.02 431.32 A: right 

431.12 433.34 B: i'm much more uh 

433.55 436.93 B: uh interested in kind of the spectacle maybe
