79.30 80.68 A: yeah 

79.41 84.98 B: and i kind of keep up on them but not i don't i don't like to sit there for a whole two hours 

84.87 95.21 A: [laughter] yeah i grew up like um i'm from boston and my family's always been like super into sports so we used to go to 

85.18 86.30 B: [laughter] 

93.05 93.74 B: (( mm )) 

95.09 105.76 A: like people are like really motivated about sports teams here like you really have to hate the yankees even if you don't follow baseball you have to hate the yankees it's like a really big thing 

99.10 99.94 B: (( oh )) 

103.06 103.85 B: (( mm )) 

104.63 105.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

105.45 106.39 B: yeah 

105.74 118.44 A: and so like i used to go to baseball games all the time with my family when i was younger and like we'd go to like celtics games and watch larry bird and stuff but i don't know anything about those sports now and like 

117.43 118.46 B: yeah 

119.65 127.86 A: i don't know but like i used to like [mn] i actually used to figure skate so i'd watch that and be really really super interested in it 

127.12 135.38 B: uh-huh [noise] yeah but i like um watching the water skiing and things like that too 'cause we got into that so 

128.39 129.21 A: but 

135.73 139.37 A: oh really but it but you can watch water skiing on t._v. 

135.76 137.24 B: um i guess that it 

138.99 142.61 B: oh i've seen the competitions where they um 

142.70 147.59 B: you know do skiing competition competitions on e._s._p._n. every once in a while 

147.45 148.33 A: uh-huh 

147.80 156.23 B: and so that's kind of fun to watch but it's not something that [noise] uh well usually we just happen on it by chance i have you know i haven't really followed it close enough to know 

156.24 163.30 B: when they you know show it and and stuff [laughter] but it is fun to watch 

161.14 165.09 A: yeah well so do they like go over jumps and stuff 

164.65 177.60 B: yeah and they'll um have them go through the the ropes and balls so they have to cut real close and if they knock something over or hit a ball then they you know knock points off and 

177.85 181.98 B: so they kind of go on their skill of of maneuvering in the water 

182.12 185.52 A: that sounds cool so do you do you do that 

183.36 184.46 B: yeah 

184.93 190.35 B: no [laughter] just wishful thinking [laughter] just do the regular 

185.76 187.19 A: [laughter] 

188.40 189.75 A: [laughter] 

190.46 200.87 B: slalom and then nothing nothing more than that [laughter] but well my husband's really good he looks like a lot of the skiers on t._v. but we don't have the balls and all that to do that 

194.43 195.44 A: well 

200.96 204.68 B: but he does really good so it's kind of fun to watch [noise] 

204.40 216.52 A: yeah i know it's it's like way more fun to watch a sport if you at least know like a little bit about it and you've experienced it to some extent 'cause then you can be like i know that that's really hard what they're doing right now [laughter] 

210.75 212.11 B: (( yeah i think )) 

215.67 219.90 B: right you appreciate it more too [laughter] so that's true 

218.43 219.75 A: yeah 

220.31 224.03 A: yeah i guess i used to play a lot of sports when i was younger and 

224.09 232.03 A: i'd watch a lot of things on t._v. and like now that i'm thinking about it 'cause i used to ski a lot when i was a little kid and um 

230.82 231.71 B: mhm 

232.59 246.43 A: uh yeah i'd like be in to watching people especially like since when i was in like junior high in high school and stuff like skiing got more popular to watch on t._v. 'cause it was like it got like more extreme or something [laughter] 

242.47 243.48 B: uh-huh 

245.93 247.30 B: yeah 

247.00 261.58 A: so that was kind of fun but i don't know now i haven't even got cable so i don't watch anything like on t._v. although um i'm an artist and i do a lot of art about professional sports now it's just really kind of funny 

248.28 249.30 B: uh-huh 

251.98 253.58 B: oh well [laughter] 

261.24 263.94 B: yeah [laughter] 

262.32 263.85 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

265.08 266.92 B: oh gosh um 

267.33 274.22 B: so i guess as far as how often i watch it it's there's like [laughter] no times per week really it's more like 

274.43 276.40 B: two or three times a year i 

276.10 277.48 A: [laughter] 

276.63 279.03 B: personally watch [laughter] 

278.60 283.41 A: yeah do you find that when you watch the superbowl you watch it for like commercials 

282.78 296.50 B: yeah so that i like that better actually 'cause like it's so repetitive to watch football they go over and over you know plays and it just gets kind of boring and uh the commercials are interesting you never know what's going to happen [mn] 

285.80 286.98 A: yeah 

296.06 304.57 A: yeah i think it's kind of weird that they're like two big american sports i like football and baseball 'cause like they're really slow sports you know 

304.13 305.28 B: mhm 

304.66 311.87 A: lot of stopping and starting and things like soccer and basketball at least the action's kind of continuous 

311.67 313.46 B: mhm that's true 

312.50 319.33 A: and then like really like like baseball's like the most boring game to watch it's like more commercials than anything else 

316.61 317.73 B: yeah 

319.22 322.71 B: that and golf [laughter] golf is over 

321.15 323.68 A: um and do you ever watch golf 

323.42 326.06 B: r- no i i couldn't stand to 

325.97 327.42 A: [laughter] 

326.11 335.87 B: uh but i've been um we've been flicking through the channels and it's like oh my god how could you i guess you haven't that's another thing you have to play it to enjoy it maybe [laughter] 

335.37 341.33 A: yeah yeah my my family is super into golf and that's like that's what's on all the time 

335.98 336.77 B: (( so )) 

341.58 343.81 A: at their house when i go see them 

343.77 344.81 B: yeah 

344.01 352.86 A: but i i can't watch it it doesn't make any sense to me i mean like the rules of the game make sense like fairly easy [noise] you just aim at the hole 

352.75 354.12 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

352.77 365.11 A: but [laughter] but i mean like watching people play it i mean it's it's such like a personal game anyway [noise] all about challenging yourself and i don't know what anybody would ever want to sit there and watch that 

358.93 360.12 B: yeah 

364.56 370.17 B: i know i i don't either even my husband who likes sports doesn't like that 

367.37 368.46 A: [laughter] 

370.65 371.76 A: [laughter] 

370.81 372.94 B: [laughter] it's kind of 

372.79 380.59 A: i mean it's really funny that um getting up going paired up to talk about professional sports when neither of us are really into them [laughter] 

379.73 390.67 B: i know [laughter] oh well i think they're just seeing how two strangers talk or something is great and on different subjects you know how where they like go with it or whatever so 

385.63 386.95 A: yeah 

390.67 396.52 A: yeah oh well i think it's like really funny 'cause i think they're trying to take topics that are definitely like um 

396.67 405.77 A: a common denominator between people and for us it seems to be that it's like neither of us watch them and don't understand why other people want to watch them 

404.45 409.39 B: i don't know [laughter] that could be it [laughter] say what's wrong with them [laughter] 

406.35 407.42 A: [laughter] 

409.18 414.39 A: exactly i would much rather watch something else like a plot or some sort of murder's going on 

409.75 410.50 B: yeah 

412.81 413.98 B: yeah 

414.22 415.29 B: i know 

414.55 416.31 A: (( be more interesting )) 

416.30 419.27 B: and it just seems oh i guess maybe 

419.44 424.00 B: run two hours but when it's sports and they're rehashing things and 

424.59 430.40 B: uh timing things it just doesn't keep my attention like a story or plot like you said just d- doesn't 

429.86 432.81 A: yeah it's definitely like 

433.22 446.15 A: i don't know i mean even though something does get results at the end like somebody wins over somebody else you know that it's not making a huge difference in their lives 'cause they're professional athletes and all they want really is to have million dollar contracts so [mn] 

440.78 441.91 B: mhm 

445.65 447.01 B: yeah 

446.41 453.53 A: [laughter] they don't really like need this game but and it's like pro people like their personal value is like 

447.10 448.87 B: well they're fine [laughter] 

450.09 451.16 B: i know 

453.63 458.87 A: i don't know like i when the patriots won the what is it called superbowl 

458.93 464.47 A: yeah the superbowl [laughter] i was um in the middle of like the big college part of boston 

464.36 478.54 A: and uh i was in a restaurant and you could like hear it when they won you could hear it like all around the city and it was just like cars started honking and people started yelling like everybody was so happy 'cause like no boston sports team had won like that for so long 

478.53 488.84 A: and it was just like like everybody knew and it was such a big deal and like for like you know a week everybody was just talking about how excited they were about how the patriots won and 

488.50 489.60 B: mhm 

488.75 497.06 A: it was just like the biggest thing and it was like wow we really got respect from the rest of the country it was like no we don't some of the team aren't even from here 

497.11 499.82 B: [mn] [laughter] mhm [laughter] yeah 

500.01 501.12 B: i know 

501.17 502.34 A: [laughter] 

502.87 503.44 B: (( [noise] )) 

503.58 504.60 B: gosh 

504.69 505.55 B: um 

506.48 514.28 B: [noise] now what do we talk about [laughter] gosh the last one was i did have you done any of others of these 

508.59 510.93 A: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

514.08 516.25 A: i did a family one last time 

516.49 522.49 B: oh ne- oh we i had a health one um your health in the winter time and what 

522.33 523.55 A: [laughter] 

522.95 524.63 B: [laughter] 

523.90 532.70 A: well i used that's a really good one people love to talk about how they're healthy they are if not healthy uh people want to talk about their ailments 

529.35 530.28 B: uh-huh 

532.61 540.70 B: yeah and so [laughter] the person that i talked to she had lots of things wrong and so that pretty much [laughter] ate up all the time so 

537.23 539.15 A: [laughter] 

540.65 545.89 A: [laughter] that's really funny yeah i talked to somebody last time about um 

541.77 543.06 B: [laughter] 

545.86 550.86 A: [lipsmack] whether about family and he was like estranged from his family 

550.57 551.93 B: oh wow 

550.73 555.25 A: and i was super close to my family so it was a really weird discussion 'cause i was like it 

553.82 555.08 B: yeah 

555.06 566.69 A: was like i love my family i love having them close by i think it's great and he was like yeah i live like two thousand miles away from my family never talk to them and i was like i'm really sorry [laughter] 

563.25 564.39 B: wow 

565.88 567.54 B: (( oh dear relate )) 

567.61 569.67 B: two opposite ends 

569.16 578.32 A: yeah that i mean not even once after 'cause we had completely opposite experiences so it was like really easy to discuss that you know 

570.03 570.89 B: wow 

575.22 576.33 B: mhm 

577.77 579.79 B: yeah that's true 

580.01 581.24 A: (( [cough] not )) 

580.43 583.25 B: did he say why he was estranged from them 

583.42 587.86 A: really it just seemed like he had like a bad relationship with his family forever 

587.07 588.54 B: (( yeah hm )) 

587.87 591.29 A: um like when he like left home he was like leaving home 

591.35 598.47 A: and i was like well i hope that you form a support system other than your family [laughter] didn't really know what to say to him 

596.31 597.43 B: yeah 

597.89 599.31 B: i know [laughter] 

599.03 599.95 A: (( and it was kind of ))
