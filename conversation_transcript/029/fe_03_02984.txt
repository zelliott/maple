154.37 155.29 A: right 

154.89 163.14 B: he yelped and whimpered for three days in a row every time we did that so i finally said to my husband you know i can't take it anymore

184.77 190.79 A: well we got 'em we got two of them and they won't separate they have to be in the same one or they won't go in 'em 

187.86 188.75 B: (( oh )) 

191.54 192.34 A: so 

192.26 193.17 B: oh 

192.93 195.94 A: waste of money there 'cause i had my my 

195.86 208.90 A: lab mix was the first one i had and after a year of having him i got the greyhound and they just are inseparable at this point and i've him the greyhound for over a year now and they just won't leave each other alone 

197.58 198.53 B: mhm 

203.34 204.16 B: oh 

209.24 213.45 B: [laughter] well greyhounds are are really neat dogs they have um 

213.74 218.49 B: i i just saw something on uh i think animal planet i don't know about rescuing 

213.79 215.05 A: they have some issues 

218.64 223.64 B: the greyhounds that have been in races and and all that that's really neat really is 

220.59 222.37 A: yeah 

225.45 233.00 A: this was from a actually he was just in a pound he we think he's probably a mix probably not a full blood and they were gonna put him down so 

229.57 230.54 B: (( so oh )) 

232.76 233.43 B: (( ooh )) 

233.15 236.21 A: we went down and got him 'cause he was just so cute 

235.50 236.80 B: (( oh yeah )) 

236.22 242.84 A: and but he was he had all he had was kennel cough but because they were overcrowded anyway they were gonna put him to sleep 

242.25 243.41 B: (( oh )) 

243.21 251.73 A: and i said you know i i work at i worked at a vet's office at the time and i was like i can get him medicated and taken care of don't worry about it 

246.69 247.67 B: mhm 

250.95 251.84 B: oh 

252.04 256.47 A: [mn] we didn't even know we were gonna keep at first i just felt bad for him to go 

256.29 259.94 B: oh yeah oh i know i know i'm 

257.12 258.14 A: you know 

258.72 259.81 A: (( but )) 

260.32 268.98 A: he has he was a weird dog when we got him greyhounds from the track are supposed to be pretty odd they they don't know how to turn right 

260.41 262.80 B: i would do the same thing [laughter] 

269.13 269.87 B: oh 

269.40 272.83 A: because they're so used to going left around the track 

270.07 271.33 B: they're always going left 

271.46 272.58 B: oh yeah 

272.99 275.63 A: and they don't understand you know like glass 

275.83 278.33 A: because most of their lives they've spent crated 

278.24 279.93 B: oh yeah 

279.32 286.70 A: and they don't understand anything like stairs glass it just freaks them out it takes a long time to get them used to just being at home 

286.23 288.34 B: right right oh 

288.67 294.12 A: but mine we he we're pretty sure he was abused and he just had some strange 

291.60 292.46 B: mhm 

294.50 298.76 A: [laughter] quirks maybe i guess you'd call 'em like he wouldn't walk through doorways 

296.63 297.58 B: yeah oh 

299.70 304.72 A: and i don't know what happened to make him not wanna do that but 

303.26 305.02 B: yeah well you never know 

305.22 307.57 B: you don't sometimes you don't wanna know [laughter] 

305.53 306.45 A: he 

307.32 316.62 A: he used to be so shy and kind of mean at first just real protective of food because what we'd heard was that he was kept with three dogs with very little food 

310.08 310.95 B: mhm 

315.78 316.59 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

316.63 324.79 A: so he had some food issues [laughter] with making sure he you know he didn't never know if he was gonna enough and if my other dog came near it he just went crazy 

318.30 319.23 B: oh 

325.12 332.35 A: but after a couple of months he just became amazing he's completely blossomed and he's a good dog 

333.26 335.43 B: (( mhm oh [laughter] oh yeah )) 

335.47 339.21 B: and then you have pit bull was it wow [laughter] 

337.09 338.77 A: mhm 

339.41 342.58 B: are they um as like what 

342.79 346.21 B: we perceive them to be or i mean is yours like a gentle 

345.22 348.03 A: absolutely not just 

346.31 347.22 B: yeah 

348.20 351.49 B: i know that but you know i just [laughter] 

348.39 349.26 A: (( the )) 

349.31 349.96 A: (( thing )) 

350.48 356.20 A: the thing about that is is it's become such a they've become kind of a fashion statement for a lot of people 

356.05 357.37 B: yes 

356.71 363.45 A: and i see them all the time now i used to never see them walking around in our neighborhood but people everywhere have them 

363.83 367.96 A: and people just don't know how to treat them they are hard to 

369.13 370.42 A: socialize 

370.11 370.99 B: right 

370.62 376.61 A: they're kind they they don't have any human aggression at all they don't hate people they love people but they 

375.18 376.20 B: mhm 

376.53 385.87 A: can have a lot of dog aggression where they get nasty with other dogs and that takes a lot of work to get that straightened out 

380.98 381.78 B: (( oh right )) 

386.78 397.84 A: but if anything they're just brill- i mean they're smart they're smart and they're sweet and they're dopey and they're everything that you don't hear about 

390.56 391.51 B: yeah 

395.52 396.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

396.47 397.41 B: yeah 

398.37 399.02 B: (( mm )) 

398.62 403.97 A: you always hear about you know the ones that get in trouble because they're strong too 

402.61 403.52 B: right 

403.56 404.69 B: (( oh i know )) 

404.03 406.83 A: they are strong so i guess if they were gonna bite you 

406.50 407.40 B: right 

407.07 409.28 A: what they would you know they would hurt 

408.79 411.84 B: right well you know i i know that 

412.53 417.75 B: i know if my dog my dog is not strong i have a little dog [laughter] but um 

416.05 417.03 A: yeah 

417.80 422.26 B: but he he's just as protective you know i mean he's oh 

420.38 421.87 A: right definitely 

422.27 423.37 B: i tell you 

422.41 428.67 A: i did uh i did a lot of research before i decided that i was gonna get any mix with a pit- with pit bull in it 

423.45 424.19 B: so 

428.04 429.07 B: mhm 

429.03 439.37 A: and they're very actually there's a list i don't know if it was the center for disease control that did but there's list of which dogs are more likely to bite 

439.16 440.27 B: mhm 

439.64 443.13 A: and golden retrievers were the highest 

442.56 443.89 B: really 

443.25 449.52 A: and they're the ones that have the biggest biter and there's other dogs that are just everyday dogs 

449.15 450.22 B: yeah 

449.61 455.43 A: that you wouldn't expect and nobody talks about how they bite people all the time but there's a lot of them 

453.29 454.09 B: right 

455.67 458.29 A: and they're real- and pit bulls are actually pretty low 

458.14 459.18 B: yeah 

458.94 463.19 A: as long as you know and i guess that's as long as they're treated right that's 

461.68 463.03 B: right oh 

463.82 468.98 B: i know it's just what you see on the news all the time when they put those horrible cases on 

469.13 470.10 B: where 

469.33 470.61 A: and i hate like 

470.19 472.35 B: i know it's so sad 

471.76 480.53 A: they're trying to pass laws and some states already have them were if a pit bull gets caught out instead of putting it into the shelter they automatically put them down 

480.03 481.52 B: (( oh oh )) 

480.90 487.45 A: and it's happened in a lot of places and in a lot places they're even banned like you can't even own one [laughter] or you'll get fined 

485.92 489.10 B: really oh i didn't know that oh [lipsmack] 

488.91 493.01 A: there's a lot of cities that have laws that say you cannot own them at all 

493.96 496.71 A: and if they if they find one on the streets they'll kill it 

497.53 503.51 A: because they're just so they're so afraid of these dogs that are just nothing like they're 

502.59 506.47 B: oh oh that's uh that's very sad it really is huh 

507.50 508.33 B: (( [noise] i )) 

508.53 510.01 B: i don't know i 

511.37 518.59 B: um i remember seeing something on the news um how they found some kind of dogs where um 

519.62 523.15 B: and they well they found video tapes of them like 

523.17 531.32 B: you know training these dogs but never pit bulls to fight and they were so mean to 'em i mean these people are just so mean 

525.74 526.90 A: mhm 

531.33 538.11 B: that do this and they train them to like get into these fights so they can bet and all that oh that's so horrible 

535.52 536.74 A: right 

537.82 540.82 A: and they do really bad things to them to get them to do that 

540.02 542.79 B: they do they do and i was cr- 

540.95 543.11 A: (( they starve 'em )) 

543.09 543.92 B: oh 

543.49 547.06 A: and they'll put food near the other one and just it's oh 

545.42 546.33 B: yeah 

546.58 556.21 B: yeah and it just makes me cry it really does i just have such a big heart for for dogs especially i mean i like all animals but i just love dogs 

555.65 556.96 A: yeah 

556.33 558.16 B: i do you know that 

557.14 562.77 A: i can see where people could be scared i mean mine is he's got a lab mixed with him so he's kind of 

562.47 563.38 B: (( yes mhm )) 

562.57 575.76 A: he's little different than a full blood i would guess he's pretty athletic like a lot of full bloods don't like he's a frisbee dog he loves frisbee and he loves the water and he just he he's got a lot of lab in him but he looks mostly like a pit bull 

563.49 564.53 B: mhm 

570.51 571.47 B: yeah 

573.35 574.29 B: mhm 

575.36 576.20 B: oh 

575.76 584.32 A: so people are scared of him all the time but once they actually see him they're just like he can't be a pit bull i'm like yeah he can he is 

581.91 582.72 B: (( [laughter] yeah oh )) 

584.40 590.96 A: but he's very protective like he just i mean he will let you know if you're in the wrong spot near me 

586.07 586.69 B: (( mm )) 

590.56 591.53 B: yeah 

591.77 593.23 B: oh yeah they do 

592.48 599.27 A: 'cause when we go down you know we got for a walk and people will come up and try to talk to us and he's just like wait a minute [laughter] 

598.95 599.89 B: [laughter]
