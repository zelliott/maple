197.69 198.82 B: um 

200.30 207.58 B: yeah i think of that as as kind of an art form too i mean they're they're striving more for a it looks like dance 

207.65 208.89 B: than um 

209.25 210.95 B: than in mastering uh 

211.22 213.69 B: i guess they have to master the technique 

213.77 218.84 B: uh but when i watch it i watch it just for the sheer beauty of it so i think of it as artistic um 

219.23 227.88 A: yeah yeah i agree but i don't know it's kind of hard not watching sports when you're in l._a. like especially the lakers since a lot of people are into them

538.63 539.33 B: (( mm )) 

539.69 551.38 B: yeah it is there's uh more energy yeah it's a lot of fun and i did like football when i was in high school when we would actually go to the games for the same reason 

551.58 555.28 B: you know your friends are playing and you know you got more from it 

555.43 557.13 B: i don't really like watching 

557.79 559.01 B: that on 

557.90 562.28 A: so what sport would you say you watched the most pretty much hockey

563.99 564.99 A: (( that's cool )) 

564.09 567.49 B: uh and after that it would be basketball 

567.57 572.61 B: uh which i actually started to enjoy watching uh with the girls so 

572.93 573.91 A: (( basketball huh )) 

572.96 575.55 B: i mean they're very enthusiastic fans 

575.67 579.17 B: so and and they really know the game and they understand the players 

578.02 581.35 A: sometimes sometimes they're a little bit too enthusiastic 

580.42 588.70 B: [laughter] my girls yeah they are 'cause uh they uh they get incensed if they think there's an injustice towards the team 

588.33 596.81 A: oh we had some riots here when the lakers won the the playoffs last year and and the year before that but 

595.11 599.95 B: mm yeah well fortunately my my girls aren't that crazy
