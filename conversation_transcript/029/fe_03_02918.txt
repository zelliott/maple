213.85 215.67 B: [laughter] 

214.82 220.17 A: how hard is it for them to get now if they put little people [laughter] and tried to 

218.51 221.72 B: mhm that's why i like iveson that's why i like iveson though 

221.59 228.28 A: okay because it look how tall they are is it is it really a big challenge for them to get it into the hoop 

227.95 232.70 B: [mn] seriously seriously it is especially when you go against a bunch of athletes you know 

229.71 231.13 A: well i guess it is 

231.18 234.02 A: well i guess they're all equal yeah 

233.44 243.34 B: yeah because uh especially if i- a- and now if they go against like some high school players then there's a different story because all of them are like they're not as talented you know 

238.28 239.58 A: yeah 

239.63 240.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

241.18 244.19 A: [laughter] well that's true 

243.97 248.43 B: yeah but it uh because i'm a i'm a basketball player you know what i'm saying i play basket 

247.40 250.21 A: are you oh really you play basketball wow 

249.06 253.51 B: yeah so i have to protect my sport [laughter] yeah yeah [laughter]

254.37 255.15 B: (( yes )) 

257.65 259.33 B: yeah definitely definitely [mn] 

258.90 265.77 A: but i don't know about watching because to me it seems like they do it so easily i mean well i guess not i guess not but it's just 

264.54 268.21 B: yeah because there is there's so much talent in them a lot of people [mn] 

266.41 278.51 A: well there's so many you know that are talented i guess they're all equal but i don't know to me they're tall so it's so to put it in the hoop what's the big deal i mean they just dunk it in i don't know i mean it's 

268.64 269.94 B: yeah 

274.72 276.05 B: [laughter] 

276.29 277.55 B: (( yeah i hear you )) 

277.70 278.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

278.75 283.01 A: for me it's more um um i'm shorter for me it's a big challenge to get it in the hoop

284.40 286.21 B: oh you're five four mm

287.31 290.19 B: [mn] [mn] yeah i'm six i'm i'm six three 

289.58 293.28 A: well that's 'cause you play basketball [laughter] that's why you play basketball 

291.06 294.03 B: yeah yeah yeah [laughter] [mn] 

293.32 297.48 A: [laughter] that makes sense you know
