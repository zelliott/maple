66.74 68.51 A: one of those

92.20 93.62 A: yeah that's neat 

92.99 102.84 B: i used to have cats as i grew up 'cause you know i really like cats but my husband's allergic to 'em and now i've been away from you know having cats i'm kinda 

102.74 103.63 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

102.93 105.92 B: not as fond of 'em [laughter] 

103.99 109.48 A: i'm not real crazy about 'em myself [laughter] actually especially when i have to clean up the litter box [laughter] 

108.93 110.11 B: yeah 

109.66 112.82 A: but um and she's she's a house cat but when it gets 

113.03 115.64 A: when it gets warmer she our 

115.72 128.18 A: screen door's not shutting right and she kinda helps herself to outside and i gotta worry about the other night she got out she's screaming under the house i was thinking where is that noise coming from 

120.16 120.98 B: [laughter] 

125.17 126.34 B: [laughter] 

128.43 133.27 A: and here the cat was outside with one of the neighbor guys the neighbor cat 

128.60 129.55 B: yeah 

133.52 143.67 B: uh well i think all pets are great i mean they're just companionship and especially if you're you know home by yourself or something so you won't feel so lonely [laughter] 

133.68 134.66 A: (( and he )) 

135.20 136.04 A: (( was )) 

138.21 139.57 A: oh yeah yeah 

143.15 146.75 A: that's for sure i just got my dog in in november 

146.77 150.67 A: and thank god they're here else i'd be going stir crazy 

148.63 149.94 B: yeah 

150.36 151.30 B: huh 

150.71 152.80 A: but they keep me a lot of company 

152.14 154.33 B: yeah 'cause my mom her 

154.38 163.82 B: it's just her and my father at their house now since all of us are grown and she has a dog and well she had a cat and she also has a dog and the cat passed away and 

163.73 175.01 B: she was so depressed she felt like she lost a big part of her family 'cause it you know she was just used to for years it being her my father and then the cat and then the dog or the cat and the dog [laughter] 

166.96 168.72 A: (( oh oh )) 

172.30 173.26 A: (( [noise] right )) 

175.03 176.18 A: (( oh )) 

175.71 185.18 B: so but i think i don't know pets are i think they're nice to have we just you know haven't had any so once we get this dog it's gonna be a little bit different i mean 

179.54 180.92 A: (( definitely mhm )) 

185.22 190.65 B: we're i'm sure we'll spend you know time in the morning feeding it and giving it water 

190.78 199.99 B: and then hopefully in the afternoon we'll spend an hour or so you know outside running and walking and playing with it and you know then again 

198.77 203.37 A: yeah they need this they need lots of lots of running time yeah 

202.70 213.75 B: yeah so i mean if we could least you know spend a little time in the morning and a little time in the afternoon and you know several hours in the evening roaming around the yard and that was it i think it'll be happy [mn] 

212.14 217.20 A: growing up with a puppy that's gonna be great my son's fourteen now and he's 

217.88 221.66 A: he's had this one since we moved here since he was just a puppy 

221.79 233.42 A: and he takes her to bed with him he's he's as big as my husband but he takes [laughter] he comes looking for her at nighttime before he goes to bed and takes him in bed with uh takes her in bed with him 

224.80 225.67 B: [laughter] 

229.04 229.82 B: [laughter] 

231.30 232.41 B: aw 

233.67 239.66 A: he just can't sleep without her it's just the funniest thing 'cause they're two of the biggest you know they're big guys 

239.04 240.64 B: yeah 

239.79 241.47 A: and there's this little tiny 

241.89 247.80 A: [laughter] and she's well nine ten years old but she just knows where to go 

247.92 248.82 B: huh 

248.83 252.81 A: and and they they don't sleep unless one's with the other 

252.64 255.53 B: well that's kinda neat kinda his little guard dog [laughter] [laughter] 

253.65 261.57 A: yeah it's funny how they and she is she is a good well you know those little ones those little yappy things but uh [laughter] 

258.82 262.09 B: yeah they'll chase anybody off and bite their toes off [laughter] 

262.20 270.19 A: they won't hurt you much but but i know every time the door you know somebody knocks at the door she's [mn] [laughter] 

269.61 270.67 B: (( [noise] [laughter] mm )) 

271.79 275.73 A: but you know she does i mean she does the percepting job 

275.56 280.55 B: yeah well i figure you know once we get this dog it'll be nice if i 

280.69 285.48 B: you know anybody that comes up that's strange i'll hear it bark when it's outside and 

284.69 286.19 A: [noise] yeah that's a help 

285.83 288.70 B: so that'll be nice 'cause i'm not used to that now 'cause it's been 

288.59 302.70 B: you know just so quiet and i hear something i don't hear people come half the time so if i have a dog outside i'll hear it bark and i'll know it's gonna be you know around and [noise] it'll be a little different spending you know i'm sure 

298.55 299.74 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

302.75 312.21 B: three hours a day at least you know taking well between feeding and playing with it and you know it's gonna be a little change to our schedule but it'll be worth it [laughter] 

311.70 315.96 A: it will i mean people don't realize what a an asset that is 

315.84 316.82 B: yeah 

316.21 322.50 A: just from the barking standpoint i mean that's a deterrent like whenever you hear 'em talk about you know 

323.02 331.30 A: robberies or whatever the deter- the deterrent is whether they hear a dog inside i've noticed that like when i at work they used to have 

324.40 325.41 B: yeah 

326.91 328.77 B: right yeah 

331.78 334.81 A: you know different seminars and stuff about safety and 

334.89 338.19 A: whatever and that was a big issue is whether 

338.86 340.11 A: (( you know uh )) 

340.89 342.62 B: yeah 

341.86 347.10 A: whether they hear something when they come to your house which is good i don't worry too much about that here but 

344.88 345.86 B: right 

346.92 355.21 B: yeah but you never know i mean i'm just kinda paranoid 'cause i don't think really any problems in my area but you always kind of paranoid 'cause you watch the news [laughter] 

348.48 349.61 A: that's right 

352.65 353.79 A: [laughter] 

354.86 356.78 A: that's true i mean you never 

355.58 361.27 B: but yeah but uh it'll be fun once we get it [noise] i'm looking forward to it [noise] so 

362.92 364.89 A: have you picked out a name for him 

364.59 366.24 B: [noise] um well 

365.08 366.35 A: or her [laughter] 

366.26 370.20 B: my son keeps saying he's gonna name it weenie from oswald [laughter] 

369.61 370.84 A: (( [laughter] )) 

370.29 373.44 B: so we're saying well maybe we'll think of something else before then 

373.28 375.00 A: (( [laughter] that's cute )) 

373.67 384.91 B: [laughter] but i've heard that pets are kind of therapeutic too so you know just 'cause of the you know calm you down and relax you when you sit there hm 

380.55 381.81 A: oh yeah 

383.50 385.18 A: i used to um i 

386.01 389.32 A: used to go over to a nursing home one of my mother's 

389.39 392.13 A: aunts live in there and they used to have a pet day 

392.41 395.78 A: where people volunteers would bring in their pets to sit with the 

396.43 398.31 A: mostly older people 

398.71 400.55 B: yeah 

399.17 402.67 A: and and it they're great with them it's just amazing 

403.21 408.71 B: [noise] yeah i just recently visited a family friend in a nursing home and they had a couple of dogs 

408.64 422.47 B: um running around in there and one of them they i guess they allow you to bring your pets there and actually one of them was one of the ladies who worked there she brings her little small poodle in i was surprised 'cause i didn't even know that they allowed you to take pets to a place like that so that was really nice 

409.86 411.38 A: yeah 

422.61 429.17 A: [laughter] i i notice that it was just you know they have a special time that you can do it and i just thought that was the best 

428.88 433.48 B: mm at this place they actually allowed the residents to bring their own pets with them 

431.99 432.71 A: (( you know )) 

433.19 434.08 A: wow 

433.49 442.64 B: so that was good 'cause if you're an old person that's had you know an animal for awhile they're gonna really be lonely if they're going to a new house and then they can't take their pet [laughter] [laughter] 

441.12 442.11 A: right 

442.51 444.32 A: (( yeah i hadn't thought about that )) 

444.60 445.44 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

445.83 458.13 B: you know plus they need the companionship a lot of time too and they're you know going off there by theirselves a lot of the time and unfortunately a lot of people don't get visited very often too in those places sometimes but 

457.79 459.09 A: yeah 

460.39 462.86 B: basically i think pets are great [laughter] 

462.03 464.34 A: [laughter] me too 

464.74 467.97 A: i mean i uh i've had them as long as i've been 

468.66 470.43 A: in this house anyway 

470.90 474.83 B: i actually had rabbits in the past i'm sorry go ahead 

471.50 474.01 A: actually since i was little oh really 

474.22 475.27 A: (( no it's all right )) 

475.01 478.95 B: [mn] i i actually had rabbits in the past also like little dwarf rabbits 

478.62 479.83 A: (( oh yeah )) 

479.23 482.43 B: when i was little i used to get those like when i was a teenager 

482.50 486.37 B: i'd get those and have a big giant cage outside 

485.05 487.74 A: they last they last long yeah 

487.00 494.24 B: [laughter] um i think i think i had one that was lasted almost a year and you know 

493.90 498.03 A: those little rodents kinda [laughter] don't seem to last too long 

495.89 496.97 B: [laughter] 

497.67 499.02 B: (( [laughter] well )) 

498.16 501.85 A: we've had hamsters and they don't last at all around here 

500.57 511.64 B: oh i used to get hamsters a lot too when i was little and my sister had one that lasted i think she had it for like two or three years 'cause i remember it was we were like amazed that a hamster had gone on that long [laughter] 

510.95 512.85 A: [laughter] that is amazing 

512.33 516.32 B: in that time i i had gone through probably ten of my own [laughter] 

513.32 513.94 A: (( [laughter] )) 

515.24 516.37 A: [laughter] 

516.60 525.70 A: i tried a couple of years ago we tried to get we you know the whole habit trail thing and bought him a hamster a week later the thing was frozen 

521.12 522.35 B: yeah 

525.74 530.21 A: on his back and like it was traumatic for me i mean like [laughter] my son was 

527.22 528.09 B: [laughter] 

530.36 535.89 A: all right he said oh what's the matter with the with the hamster [laughter] i was 

533.96 536.19 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

535.99 537.21 A: (( devastated )) 

537.29 542.27 B: yeah i thought i i would try to do everything right when i was little and i'd take care of 'em and they'd 

537.93 538.99 A: [laughter] 

541.02 541.80 A: (( mm )) 

542.45 544.92 B: (( just up and die [laughter] )) 

543.44 548.76 A: so we went and got him another him and um darn it the next week it wasn't dead [laughter] 

548.12 550.07 B: yeah that's that's how mine 

549.25 550.10 A: but 

550.09 553.78 B: i'm wondering a lot of time if we get 'em and they're already sick [laughter] 

550.32 551.51 A: that's pretty 

552.94 557.81 A: that's what i thought and and we called the pet store and they said well just bring it back 

557.45 558.74 B: mhm 

557.94 560.36 A: (( put it in a box you know and bring it i said ooh )) 

560.96 562.02 A: bring it back 

561.75 562.72 B: [laughter] 

562.89 564.28 A: so we did that 'cause 

564.42 566.94 A: it's fairly common apparently 

566.64 567.72 B: yeah 

567.10 568.82 A: wet tail or or 

569.73 573.78 B: yeah i remember now that you said that i remember some of ours would get that 

570.09 570.85 A: (( something )) 

573.29 574.60 A: yeah 

573.92 575.67 B: 'cause i think there was medicine 

576.36 577.57 B: [laughter] 

576.83 585.49 A: well i had no idea and then each time we would get one and it would die [laughter] and i would just feel horrible i said we have put this habit trail away [laughter] 

585.15 587.87 B: [laughter] go to a fish or something [laughter] 

586.30 587.13 A: yes 

587.78 594.03 A: we'll that's what we're gonna do next i think for his birthday my husband and i i think are gonna do a fish tank about 

593.64 598.03 B: yeah we had a a large fish tank we just got rid of it [laughter] 

594.60 595.80 A: (( a fifty gallon [mn] )) 

598.78 599.89 A: we used to
