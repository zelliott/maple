243.09 252.07 A: i guess we're straying off topic [noise] so when you or who is you're uh so do you get roped into watching football quite a bit or you said that you normally watch

282.27 292.73 A: and sometimes i think i'm still too much into sports but i used to be so much worse it's like so i played 'em in in high school and it's just easy to keep watching 'em but 

293.21 304.08 A: i used to i used to i guess not think of watching sports as as such a waste of time as i do now but it's like um if you watch a couple of football games you're whole day is shot 

303.50 304.65 B: right 

304.69 305.73 A: so 

305.86 306.96 A: (( you know ))
