114.78 124.01 A: i'm not a a particular sports fan and i don't the only game i've ever gone to that i can recall was in chicago that's where i'm originally from 

123.65 124.94 B: yeah 

124.13 134.22 A: and i went to uh a football game once in about nineteen fifty eight and i and i went to uh a basketball game in san francisco uh 

134.83 138.79 A: the my friend's grandson was playing with uh high school 

138.42 139.62 B: (( yeah )) 

138.89 141.32 A: i'm not a sports fan because 

141.67 144.05 A: i have particular sports that i do like 

144.06 149.20 A: but i'm not diligent about you know watching anything or being involved in it because 

146.86 148.11 B: yeah 

149.25 150.39 A: i think 

150.60 161.60 A: when i was a kid growing up it looks like to me that i was never really good at any sport i used to try to run like with my brother and i could never beat him running 

159.15 160.12 B: (( yeah )) 

161.76 165.13 A: and then when they'd have you ever heard of field day 

165.32 167.87 B: uh yeah at the end of school 

168.00 175.15 A: well yeah probably around the end yeah something and they used to have field day and we'd all get out and participate in like uh 

169.86 171.41 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

174.74 177.91 B: the long jump and yep yep 

175.77 176.95 A: yeah right 

177.31 181.63 A: all of that and there was nothing that i seemed to be good at and 

181.60 193.95 A: you know it just kinda made me feel bad i tried to play bas- uh baseball a couple of times and so basketball happens to be my favorite sport and then like i like ping pong and i i do like tennis 

194.09 194.94 B: yeah 

194.23 195.91 A: and that's that's about it 

196.11 198.51 B: well do you watch the tennis matches on t._v. 

198.18 199.94 A: i don't watch a lot of t._v. 

199.36 204.78 B: no you don't see i don't i don't either i don't have the time anymore with those little kids running around 

204.59 205.59 A: yeah 

204.98 216.00 B: um but i i will turn on a a basketball game every once in a while and then special games you know the um the superbowl or the olympics 

215.25 216.57 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

216.12 222.15 B: things like that i usually try and catch a lot of that um just because it's such you know a big deal 

218.96 220.08 A: mhm 

221.91 222.95 A: (( yeah )) 

222.54 227.60 B: um but i don't think that i can say that i watch anything regularly 

227.50 228.40 A: (( mhm )) 

228.17 230.66 B: because i just don't get that t._v. even turned on 

230.36 239.89 A: well if the t._v. is on and somebody's watching a g- a game like basketball i wat- and football uh really turns me off 

235.42 236.40 B: yep 

239.79 247.15 A: and one thing i hate about football is the way those guy go up and tap those other men on the behind i hate that i think that is so 

244.15 247.62 B: [laughter] 

247.14 258.17 A: there's something about it i don't like and all that roughage and people getting their hurt and all that so that i i like i think the reason why i like basketball more is because 

247.86 248.58 B: [laughter] 

248.79 250.47 B: [laughter] 

250.83 252.89 B: yeah 

258.10 262.35 A: you can see exactly what they're doing they're trying to get that ball in that basket [laughter] 

261.64 263.86 B: right [laughter] 

262.38 268.39 A: you know and then when i was in high school we used the girls had to play basketball 

268.03 269.32 B: did they yeah 

268.43 274.67 A: and yeah i remember when they were teaching us how to sh- shoot and they how they showed us to shoot and i still remember that 

274.14 276.70 B: [laughter] oh 

274.88 277.07 A: so i'm not a sports fan 

276.86 278.67 B: yeah yeah 

277.51 285.53 A: i'm just not and all that hoopla and uh and it does it's okay for other people i'm not even about to try to condemn it but it's just that it's not me 

285.35 289.70 B: yeah yeah i guess i agree i guess i agree 

286.08 286.84 A: mm 

288.32 292.55 A: i was so disappointed when they said sports i said they don't wanna hear what i gotta say 

290.27 297.83 B: [laughter] well i don't think they care about our opinions they just wanna get us talking 

292.97 293.80 A: (( mm )) 

297.75 298.65 A: oh 

298.33 300.49 B: so uh yeah i i think 

299.76 302.66 A: you don't think they really care i thought they they they're trying to 

302.00 303.69 B: [mn] no i think 

302.68 305.04 A: do some type of type of research or 

304.64 308.99 B: well it is research but i think they're researching more like um 

309.85 316.90 B: how we talk to each other and our speech patterns and the things we say you know but not our opinions just you know 

311.69 312.40 A: (( mm )) 

315.34 321.41 A: oh yeah i think i'd i you know i do think i remember hearing them say that it's been so long ago 

321.46 326.34 A: uh my god it's been about maybe a m- maybe almost two months ago that 

326.39 329.11 A: i called that number to participate in this 

327.50 328.31 B: yeah 

328.80 329.89 B: yeah 

329.29 338.93 A: i got it uh the this information out of uh some newspaper i was reading and i do remember that they did say something about speech patterns and wherever i wrote 

338.99 342.35 A: the uh particulars down but i don't even know what i did with 'em 

342.05 343.86 B: yeah is this your first call 

342.55 343.31 A: and 

343.63 348.03 A: no uh you know they couldn't reach me for a while 'cause i wasn't at home 

344.21 344.90 B: no 

347.59 348.54 B: yeah 

348.15 357.55 A: and when i would call and check my messages and found out that they had called i said oh my god i'm so disappointed i did wanna participate 

355.78 356.34 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

357.61 361.16 A: but what happened was last week i happened to be here and they called 

360.85 361.62 B: yeah 

361.29 362.50 A: and so 

362.59 367.84 A: monday they called and tuesday they called and we did illness and we did uh 

367.95 368.98 A: (( food )) 

368.97 369.89 B: okay

373.17 381.05 B: [noise] [laughter] well let's see i guess if we were gonna sum this up then we would say that neither of us is particularly 

374.17 375.17 A: (( [laughter] )) 

381.11 390.41 B: interested in in professional sports on t._v. um unless it's you know maybe a special occasion you know a special thing or something or 

390.10 390.96 A: (( mm )) 

390.45 397.60 B: or um if somebody else in the family is already watching it i guess that would be to to sum it up 

394.41 395.34 A: yeah 

396.96 403.20 A: yeah oh for myself i would just say i glimpse it i just glimpse it if if it's on and other than that
