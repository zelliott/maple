143.52 151.90 A: i don't usually have a lot of i mean i have s- you know i have some friends that are i have one friend that's a huge dallas stars fan 

151.82 152.72 B: okay 

152.52 153.66 A: so 

154.44 159.52 B: do you think that um sports being on t._v. is maybe a bad thing or 

159.55 160.35 A: no 

160.39 161.89 A: not really i mean 

160.93 163.53 B: you're not an advocate for one way or another it 

162.15 165.23 A: it's just yeah it's just really a personal preference 

163.70 165.20 B: just doesn't really interest you 

165.61 169.72 B: that's your own personal opinion towards it i guess 

167.57 175.16 A: yeah i never even uh i never played little league when i was kid my brothers did but i just never did 

175.02 175.99 B: okay 

176.71 180.53 B: uh yeah i'm a little bit of a sports buff 

180.48 181.06 A: (( so )) 

181.00 185.44 B: (( so yeah uh [mn] you recall what the other )) 

184.42 187.16 A: [laughter] so where so where are you from mm 

186.14 189.49 B: uh i'm originally from new york and uh now i'm living in uh 

189.74 191.43 B: washington d._c. 

191.43 192.68 A: mhm 

192.27 197.71 B: yep [noise] uh let's see what else can i think about sports 

198.18 203.49 B: um [mn] we actually have a big thing going on here's i i don't know if you're aware of um 

203.58 210.92 B: [lipsmack] one of the the uh baseball teams the montreal expos they trying to contract the league and uh maybe get rid of them 

210.94 215.13 B: and um th- the d._c. area which includes um 

215.86 222.57 B: virginia and maryland they're they're trying to attract and build a new stadium so maybe we could um 

217.34 218.17 A: right 

222.63 229.42 B: have them if they choose to move and not get rid of the team and it's kind of a a big thing going on here 

227.19 227.84 A: (( mm )) 

229.56 234.43 B: seeing as hopefully uh it would be a uh a good thing for the city [sigh] 

236.11 240.24 A: [noise] is that gonna be a big deal for them to move from canada to the u._s. 

239.68 244.40 B: yeah uh definitely be a big deal but the the reason that um they're probably moving is 

244.43 246.90 B: they're losing a lot of money um 

247.02 259.64 B: in part to to no one really going to their games and very little t._v. revenue and i think that it would uh really beneficial to the owners if they would uh bring them here 

251.10 252.11 A: (( hm )) 

260.02 261.68 B: but who knows 

262.19 263.87 B: we'll see 

263.52 266.43 A: yeah 

266.48 271.18 A: [cough] so would they be be based like are they talking about basing them right in d._c. or 

270.37 274.53 B: yeah that that's actually one of the uh big debates is that um 

274.55 281.71 B: d._c. has a very strong mass transit system that runs through maryland and virginia and the district 

281.76 288.59 B: and they're deciding you know if they were to put in the district there isn't really much room because it's a very small 

288.39 300.55 B: area where they'd be able to put it and if then if they were to take it into virginia would it be accessible for um washington d._c. residents so they'd want it very metroable accessible so 

290.67 291.38 A: (( mhm )) 

300.52 307.94 B: there may have to be some concessions made if they have it in virginia and then the problem was where to put it really if they were to have it in the district 

307.82 308.75 A: (( mm hm )) 

308.93 311.84 B: [sigh] it's a big juggling act 

312.36 315.67 B: so have you ever done uh any of these before is this the first one you've done 

315.30 318.52 A: [laughter] so this is the second one actually i did uh 

316.72 318.23 B: second one okay 

318.71 320.83 A: i got one call um i 

321.52 325.16 A: think it was thursday night last thursday night 

324.57 325.50 B: okay 

325.84 326.77 A: so 

326.55 328.26 B: uh what was the topic for that one 

328.24 333.05 A: we were actually talking about well t._v. again we were talking about reality t._v. shows 

332.31 335.37 B: (( oh that sounds like a good do you watch any of that )) 

335.06 339.28 A: um the only one that my wife and i ever really watched was the amazing race 

339.05 340.01 B: okay 

339.61 341.68 A: we got a huge kick out of that one 

341.24 344.87 B: yeah i had one yesterday on bioterrorism 

344.29 345.13 A: wow 

344.88 345.98 B: yeah 

345.34 347.62 A: that'd be [laughter] interesting 

347.04 348.24 B: yeah it was 

349.33 355.94 B: um [mn] i guess so so your wife does does she have an interest in sports at all or not so much 

355.65 358.99 A: t- the only she is a denver broncos fan 

358.63 360.32 B: oh good types 

359.26 367.19 A: and that's the only televised sport i have ever watched was when the broncos went to the superbowl she you know wanted me to watch it with her so 

366.60 369.11 B: yeah they went to it a couple of times back to back 

368.15 368.90 A: yeah 

369.26 371.18 B: then terrell davis left 

372.06 374.44 B: (( um hm )) 

374.48 376.87 A: so that's that's pretty much it 

376.43 379.02 B: yeah what were the other do you uh 

380.27 385.86 B: t._v. [mn] i wish they could remind us i didn't really listen to the whole introduction 

385.95 393.15 A: i didn't catch the whole introduction i was in the living room eating dinner and i let the uh answering machine [laughter] pick it up 

387.85 388.79 B: oh really 

392.13 394.14 B: (( oh okay [noise] yeah )) 

393.94 396.39 A: so i actually uh 

396.68 400.41 A: ran in and grabbed the phone and i didn't even catch the whole introduction 

399.96 402.12 B: yeah 

401.02 404.69 A: it'll be on my answering machine when we're done but 

404.54 409.18 B: what other things could we talk about uh professional sports being on t._v. 

409.19 411.24 B: (( um [mn] [mn] )) 

416.70 424.91 B: do you think that the um the networks profit uh maybe too much from uh having professional sports or do you have any opinion on that 

425.15 426.03 A: um 

426.68 431.48 A: not really i mean my personal opinion is i think a lot of the sports players 

431.85 433.87 A: are paid way too high 

433.33 434.59 B: mhm 

433.95 434.84 A: (( you know )) 

434.86 439.88 A: that that does kind of disturb me a little bit you know especially here in dallas 

437.26 438.55 B: mhm 

439.94 441.14 A: the uh 

441.58 444.03 A: you know i mean the dallas cowboys 

443.78 444.62 B: okay 

444.31 447.62 A: are kinda like the definition of criminals 

448.20 449.17 B: okay 

448.44 456.05 A: you know most of the dallas cowboys [laughter] at one point or another are wanted for some kind of crime and you know typically 

453.93 454.98 B: really 

456.12 458.94 A: they usually get off the hook because 

457.72 459.24 B: this i didn't know 

459.76 465.27 A: oh man i mean these guys have been busted for rape they've been busted for 

466.14 471.68 A: just all kinds of crap there's one guy just recently was involved in a major hit and run 

471.61 485.29 A: just killed these two guys on the side of the road somebody had like you know been in a little accident and these two guys pulled over to help 'em got out of their car and he just come comes by drunker than a skunk slams into them kills them both 

485.16 486.12 B: okay 

485.80 491.18 A: and i think they they take it a whole lot easier on them because 

491.39 494.16 A: [cough] you know they don't want the team to lose 

494.66 499.11 A: a good player and so i think the judges actually take it easier on them 

495.61 496.52 B: uh-huh 

498.54 500.23 B: yeah which i guess is 

500.70 503.86 B: i guess we could kind of link that up to 

504.47 512.41 B: them making a lot of money and then making more money for the networks and kinda have a whole big business kind of monopoly in terms of that i guess 

507.60 508.51 A: (( oh yeah )) 

519.70 523.34 B: (( [mn] sports sports )) 

523.91 533.08 B: so i guess yeah if a sport that interested you was on t._v. as you said before you would have really no interest in uh viewing that i guess right 

532.31 535.04 A: but yeah probably not i mean it's just uh 

535.31 535.87 A: (( [cough] )) 

536.08 538.59 A: you know i mean what're you gonna do watch somebody else 

538.88 540.72 A: dive or watch you know 

540.60 544.37 B: d- diving as in like kinda part of swimming or or you mean scuba diving

555.72 563.59 A: now the figure skatin- figure skating i used to like it and it's gotten a little annoying over the last couple of years but all a bunch of prima donnas but 

560.88 562.02 B: yeah 

562.99 563.98 B: [laughter] 

565.04 565.95 A: (( i don't know )) 

566.28 573.76 A: my wife actually used to work for uh u._s. swimming we used to live in colorado springs and she worked for um

587.09 588.59 B: oh okay oh 

588.37 589.36 A: so 

589.84 593.29 A: she's into a lot of that when the olympics are on but 

594.10 595.96 B: but other than that that's uh 

596.20 599.51 B: that's pretty much the extent of it and and besides her broncos 

599.55 599.89 A: (( yeah ))
