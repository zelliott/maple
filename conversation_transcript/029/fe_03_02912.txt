7.67 8.99 B: oh really 

8.30 9.23 A: yes 

9.05 14.52 B: well i would uh think that uh baseball is one of the two most perfect games ever invented by man you know 

14.24 17.47 A: [laughter] of course [laughter] what would the other one be 

17.01 18.08 B: chess 

17.72 19.46 A: chess on t._v. 

19.77 23.48 B: well i don't watch it just a games to play or to uh 

23.67 25.13 B: chess isn't really a

25.65 27.18 B: a spectator sport 

26.50 28.76 A: yes i didn't think so [laughter] 

27.78 35.72 B: that's why i said games and not yeah do do you watch mu- 'cause i gave up watching most sports on television actually for some reason 

28.77 30.34 A: oh okay [laughter] 

35.65 40.18 A: um i usually just i don't watch anything other than baseball if i'm uh 

40.85 47.27 A: um usually i mean baseball now i don't even get to watch it because they the restrictions now that go with it 

47.68 48.66 B: what do you mean 

48.25 55.55 A: well in new york you can't watch um the yankees basically anymore unless you have a specific um t._v. program so 

55.78 57.05 A: i don't watch any 

56.77 58.76 B: mean you you have to buy a package 

58.19 60.49 A: yeah to have to buy a certain network 

60.18 63.17 B: wow well i'm from philadelphia they don't they don't have that yet 

62.57 64.68 A: oh [laughter] yeah 

63.94 66.93 B: so so the yankees are basically only on cable 

66.70 76.16 A: it's only on a um it's only on the network called y._e._s. and it's not even part of a a cable package it's like you have to buy cable and then you have to buy a different package on top of it 

75.53 77.24 B: (( [laughter] it's )) 

76.41 79.26 A: so it's like you spend so much money so you don't even 

79.59 81.39 A: it's not worth it [laughter] 

81.34 83.65 B: kind of like inheritance tax isn't it 

83.09 84.77 A: exactly [laughter] 

83.87 91.52 B: where your your [laughter] your parents already spent their their entire lifetime paying taxes on their stuff then when you get it you have to pay taxes again 

89.32 89.98 A: (( [laughter] )) 

91.05 92.69 A: yes [laughter] 

91.87 93.18 B: they're double dipping 

92.78 94.02 A: yes [laughter] 

93.37 100.04 B: i always thought that baseball was the only sport that was actually uh uh uh fun to listen to on the radio 

99.65 100.68 A: uh-huh 

100.97 102.55 A: yeah i mean i 

101.01 104.42 B: you know the the other sports are much too quick or something you know 

104.07 105.28 A: (( yeah )) 

104.86 107.79 B: maybe it's because the you know the other sports are oblong 

107.40 108.43 A: yes 

108.55 111.16 B: you know whereas the the baseball is round 

110.57 115.30 A: yeah [laughter] that's true do you watch any other sport beside baseball on t._v. 

114.38 121.81 B: well i i uh i follow the other sports but i'll watch them for a while but i don't know what it is either my concentration level's 

122.33 127.13 B: is is so weakened now i can't i just can't sit there and watch unless i'm with someone else 

126.54 127.55 A: uh-huh 

127.37 128.24 B: you know 

128.08 131.24 A: yes i agree with that it's kinda boring by yourself 

131.74 137.60 B: but uh like i said like like except for baseball i'll put that i can put that on the radio that's fine 'cause you can do st- other stuff 

137.02 138.56 A: (( yeah )) 

138.25 143.35 B: but other uh other women most of most women that i that i've spoken to they'll they'll watch uh 

143.70 146.08 B: they'll watch uh figure skating 

145.50 146.81 A: (( no )) 

146.82 150.41 B: which which i'm not ev- uh uh which i'm not sure it's even a sport 

149.84 152.43 A: [laughter] oh i guess i consider it a sport 

152.22 158.78 B: well someone someone uh came up with the idea that it it can't be a sport if you can't prevent the other person from scoring [laughter] 

158.63 162.79 A: oh okay [laughter] yeah that's the uh figure skating 

159.61 160.47 B: so 

161.92 170.42 B: which would eliminate golf but also would eliminate all the the uh you know uh track and field because track and field certainly are legitimate sports and gym- gymnastics as well 

166.69 167.65 A: yeah 

170.03 173.55 A: well golf too i mean they consider golf a sport you know 

171.42 178.67 B: that's what i mean golf yeah i mean yeah you know you don't even golf you don't even play with the person that [laughter] you're competing against necessarily 

177.46 179.86 A: exactly so 

179.03 181.59 B: you know like tiger woods is like three holes ahead of you 

181.23 183.97 A: yeah [laughter] true oh 

183.80 189.85 B: yeah and then they have this other stuff like floor dancing you ever see that stuff the stuff with the streamers [laughter] 

186.37 187.48 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

188.84 191.00 A: (( [laughter] )) 

190.39 192.43 B: so i don't even know about that 

191.49 193.69 A: the rhythmic gymnastics yeah 

193.14 196.22 B: but the other thing about uh like sports on television 

196.55 201.73 B: uh they se- they they they seem to be putting more and more commercials in there too 

201.21 204.39 A: well that's yeah that's how they pay for it 

202.54 206.58 B: and there's more stop yeah and there's more stoppage in the action 

205.89 211.58 A: yeah well i think that's how a lot of the um salaries get paid too though i mean that's why these 

210.45 214.09 B: [sigh] well that's exac- that's why the salaries are spiraled out of control 

213.40 226.05 A: yeah exactly that's one of the biggest things too that's why i'm not a sports like basketball i used to like basketball and and now i just have no desire to watch it because these me- men make outrageous money for for what putting a ball in a hoop 

225.54 226.48 B: uh-huh 

226.10 227.14 A: (( you know )) 

226.77 230.31 B: well i think they uh uh aren't they isn't baseball and and 

229.67 235.58 A: baseball yeah has to be one of the worst yeah i mean yeah and the yankees are probably right up there 

231.30 232.26 B: yeah 

234.37 239.43 B: 'cause too well maybe maybe 'cause i don't follow uh basketball and i don't know the game as as well 

238.84 240.22 A: mhm 

239.60 249.35 B: but it uh it's not as bad for uh basketball to to my mind as it is in in baseball which is it's it's all uh sta- stat- uh driven by statistics 

248.89 250.44 A: oh yeah definitely 

249.36 256.47 B: i mean you know you know somebody said two forty five they certainly shouldn't be making two point five million dollars a year and that's probably low end 

253.92 255.10 A: yeah 

255.84 257.98 A: yeah and some of these 

256.56 260.38 B: (( but i i think uh i think uh the uh the um )) 

260.59 261.70 B: the uh 

262.04 263.62 B: what do i want to say the uh 

264.60 268.11 B: the average salary of baseball has has gone up over two million dollars now 

267.59 269.30 A: oh yeah definitely 

268.70 271.34 B: the av- the average salary [laughter] [mn] 

270.49 274.90 A: [laughter] well yeah they i mean these guys make a lot of money for 

275.30 284.14 A: you know and when they get injured they have nothing else to go forward you know and they basically made their money you know for one season two seasons they could have made you know 

284.48 287.72 A: basically what somebody normal joe had made in a lifetime 

287.55 289.68 B: yeah 

288.24 290.15 A: it's ridiculous [laughter] 

290.62 292.19 A: but yeah 

291.38 299.94 B: but but the same on t._v. too is with a guy uh you watch probably watch enough baseball where they go to a commercial and and you come back and you're like in you're in the middle of a count you 

299.26 301.79 A: exactly which is yeah 

300.39 307.53 B: know how did how did that guy get off first base [laughter] what happened here how come it's three to one [laughter] 

302.60 305.62 A: yeah that's i i don't yeah 

306.31 309.95 A: i'd rather be sitting in a game than [laughter] actually watching it on t._v. 

308.70 312.70 B: i actually went to i actually went to the uh the uh phillies home opener this year 

312.06 313.12 A: uh-huh 

313.00 320.53 B: you know and and the weather was uh kinda kinda nasty but the worst thing was it was like five you know five to one before i got to my seat [laughter] 

319.61 321.34 A: (( [laughter] )) 

320.68 324.41 B: so that was kinda bad and then the the next day they won like thirteen nothing or something 

323.80 324.88 A: uh-huh 

324.45 326.15 B: (( so i went to the wrong game )) 

325.55 330.10 A: yeah exactly [laughter] you can never tell but yeah 

330.20 332.24 B: (( well i think it's this cable thing too )) 

331.80 335.18 A: oh well that's yeah that's that just a racket in new york 

333.73 341.95 B: but i mean they they they'll pay these outrageous prices because they have they you know they have to put something on television they have some yeah you know they need something to fill up their airtime [cough] 

338.53 339.52 A: (( yeah and )) 

341.32 345.93 A: it's just the yankees though too that have this special network the mets play on regular 

345.08 347.85 B: well weren't they weren't the yankees on m._s._n. before 

347.51 349.67 A: they were not last year the 

348.58 351.93 B: oh m._s._g. my mistake madison square garden network 

349.71 350.68 A: (( yeah )) 

351.23 352.47 A: two years ago 

352.55 357.05 A: last year they were on the y._e._s. network that was the first year that steinbrenner did it 

354.82 356.01 B: is that part of 

356.71 359.27 B: is that part of uh madison square garden or 

358.43 365.08 A: no it's a different total different package it has to do with um you have to buy that um digital cable or something 

364.67 367.18 B: what does y._e._s. stand for yankee something 

366.61 373.31 A: yeah yankees entertainment systems or something like that 'cause steinbrenner owns the the uh network 

369.06 370.83 B: [laughter] 

373.13 375.32 B: oh come on now that's that's almost [mn] 

374.11 376.10 A: yeah he doesn't have enough money 

376.11 377.49 A: [laughter] 

376.68 381.94 B: [laughter] uh uh they used to uh they used to not allow that didn't they [noise] 

381.15 395.22 A: yeah and i think they allow yeah last year was the first year they allowed it and then a lot of people complained and then they dropped the package down a little bit this year but you still have to have some kind of satellite dish or digital cable or something to get the network 

394.69 405.47 B: [noise] well probably i'm mistaken but one time you couldn't you couldn't own like uh like a newspaper and a radio station in the same market they wouldn't let yeah they they want you to have conform no 

400.32 401.74 A: yeah a monopoly 

401.94 402.89 A: mhm 

403.60 406.64 A: oh now they don't care 'cause he's probably paying off 

406.91 410.67 A: you know the mayor of new york a nice penny to the side of it 

410.24 413.14 B: well like down here they have uh like comp cast sports 

412.54 413.54 A: uh-huh 

413.18 419.83 B: sports network now and they have obviously they have the the television outlet but they own the sixers they own the you know the basketball team 

419.20 420.26 A: uh-huh 

420.10 422.50 B: you know and they have and they own the flyers so 

422.21 423.48 A: yeah 

423.59 425.38 A: (( well yeah but you know )) 

423.90 430.64 B: [laughter] so it so they they actually uh bought something to put on their [laughter] 

430.47 434.28 A: [laughter] yeah you buy something to put on your network [laughter] 

430.96 436.13 B: to put on their put on their television network yeah well now that we have this television network 

435.43 439.29 A: yeah exactly why not let's just buy a team [laughter] 

436.30 437.84 B: (( what are we going to put yeah )) 

438.58 446.67 B: but apparently the the the guy who owns this comp cast is uh uh now is one of the largest uh communications magnates in the world 

446.07 447.12 A: uh-huh 

446.76 452.48 B: 'cause he he merged with somebody just a while ago so he's worth over i don't know how many billions of dollars now [mn] 

451.92 454.25 A: oh yeah like they don't have enough money 

454.38 457.12 A: they need to just keep getting more [laughter] 

456.94 459.29 B: (( [mn] i don't blame 'em for that no but )) 

458.13 460.52 A: no exactly oh yeah good for him 

461.43 463.05 B: but we uh 

463.12 469.22 B: i figure that that uh is obviously the wave of uh of the present 

468.07 469.24 A: mhm 

469.34 476.37 B: i mean 'cause you can't you can't have you can't have like family ownership of a of a team anymore because uh you can't pay for it 

475.76 477.18 A: yeah 

476.64 483.42 B: so you have to have it has to be owned by a corporation and if it's a media corporation 'cause uh doesn't w._g._n. in chicago don't they own the cubs 

483.09 484.50 A: i think so yeah 

483.74 485.76 B: yeah now turner used to own uh 

485.53 487.19 A: turner used to yeah he 

486.63 491.13 B: before he sold uh you know turner broadcasting which i believe he did right 

490.53 493.30 A: i think so i think he just sold the last year or two years ago 

492.21 493.99 B: to c._b._s. or something 

493.58 494.83 A: (( t- t._n._t. )) 

494.59 495.64 B: t._n._t. 

495.13 496.41 A: (( yeah )) 

496.10 499.59 B: but he had you know so so there was that 

498.46 499.92 A: [laughter] 

499.93 506.74 B: and rupert murdoch he has a hold of the ch- the dodgers they say they're run- he's running that franchise into the ground which is [laughter] i 

499.95 500.72 A: yeah 

502.53 503.66 A: (( oh jeeze )) 

507.10 508.51 B: don't know how you do that 

507.93 511.70 A: no exactly well they're thinking about moving the yankees to new jersey now 

511.56 512.51 B: again 

512.12 513.49 A: yeah they 

512.68 521.26 B: 'cause they remember he was uh steinbrenner was was yapping about the the the state of yankee stadium a coupla years ago and the you know 

518.55 519.51 A: yeah 

520.30 523.19 A: well they're supposedly building like a new stadium near 

522.72 525.85 B: they uh they they can't possibly do that do you think 

525.24 529.88 A: i don't think so i mean i don't know how new yorkers would feel about that 

527.99 530.64 B: the people the people of new york wouldn't allow it would they [mn] 

530.07 534.58 A: i they they would have no choice i think because bloomberg would get paid enough for it 

534.62 540.56 A: the mayor of new york why not you know he's going to make enough money for the city why not sell the yankees out 

540.88 541.77 A: so 

541.34 544.62 B: well how would the how how is the mayor involved i don't understand 

543.98 552.21 A: because they would have to pay for because i think they have a contract with the stadium or something to do within the bronx and they would get paid out or something 

552.86 559.07 A: something to he would make new york city would make a lot of money on a deal i i am assuming yeah 

557.53 558.59 B: really 

559.31 565.89 A: i mean i don't know how i mean they're stating that they're going to build a stadium by next season in new jersey by giant stadium 

566.30 569.11 A: so i don't know how quickly that would be built and 

568.01 573.08 B: so they're going to have two football teams and one of your baseball teams will be playing in new jersey [laughter] 

572.39 574.19 A: and our hockey team 

573.88 576.93 B: and the hockey team but the rangers don't play in new jersey 

574.61 575.54 A: yeah 

576.12 580.77 A: well the the jersey devils but a little you know they you know 

581.49 582.67 A: (( people still )) 

581.52 591.36 B: yeah another thing i just read i was reading in the paper yesterday speaking of sports on television that uh the time the all star game the outcome of the all star game it's a home field advantage in the world series 

590.97 592.26 A: oh really 

591.71 599.95 B: yeah they want the winner of the all star game uh obviously whether it's american league or the national league whoever win you know whichever league wins the world series the the all star game that league will 

597.42 598.44 A: uh-huh
