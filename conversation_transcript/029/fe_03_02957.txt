180.03 181.62 B: well um 

181.73 186.61 B: because i'm from l._a. and i'm a laker fan but 

186.72 195.42 B: not necessarily a diehard you know when they start missing things i just have to walk away from it and i know they do better when they're down

253.06 254.35 B: but um 

253.58 264.07 A: yeah i mean well i find i mean it's so early in the season i mean come you know playoff times i mean i'll i'll watch you know every game every night you know so i mean and i mean it just 

261.08 263.65 B: right right and especially if it's 

263.94 266.41 B: if it's good playoffs like 

265.99 269.78 A: right well the yankees are always in the playoffs [laughter] 

266.63 268.34 B: like the angels was 

268.73 275.43 B: oh yeah yeah you know um well at the beginning everybody's in in the in the playoffs

276.84 277.76 A: yeah 

280.29 281.17 A: right 

280.55 283.28 B: and once they start narrowing it down 

283.51 295.91 B: um i mean last year the the angels ga- the series the whole thing was just incredible and not just because they're from here but it was you know they were down out so many times
