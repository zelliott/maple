61.57 72.24 B: yeah [laughter] and i don't know if it's a professional or uh no or i don't know i suppose it is because there's a a lot of money attached but that's really the only sport that uh 

62.82 63.94 A: oh 

72.95 74.20 B: that i 

74.38 81.99 B: participate in myself and that that i would be interested in watching sometimes tennis i'll watch tennis if it

84.60 99.26 A: um i like actually i like basketball and i like watching football too and i like tennis and recently um i don't play golf but my boyfriend plays golf and he taught me all the rules so 

99.14 103.32 A: i've started to watch golf and i never thought i'd do that but um [laughter] 

103.39 104.43 B: yeah 

103.72 111.73 A: um yeah but i don't have uh cable t._v. i got rid of my cable because i wasn't watching so much 

111.83 112.72 B: oh 

112.19 118.51 A: so it's it's hard for me 'cause i don't have you know the e._s._p._n. or t._n._t. to watch the sports 

118.03 119.53 B: yeah yeah 

118.64 123.78 A: and like i really only watch i don't watch t._v. really anymore so 

123.88 125.98 A: um i yeah 

123.99 133.85 B: well i don't either [laughter] i really don't i do have cable t._v. but now you mentioned golf i will watch golf but that's ju- that's usually during 

126.75 128.12 A: yeah i mean 

133.78 146.61 B: channel flicking um surfing uh what have you and and not that i'm that interested in golf but i like to be it's usually played in a beautiful spot where it's sunny and green in the middle of winter 

135.77 137.42 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

143.89 145.52 A: yeah 

146.27 147.59 A: (( exactly [laughter] )) 

146.64 148.45 B: so [laughter] 

147.66 149.76 A: nice to look at [laughter] 

149.03 154.09 B: so that's kind of nice so you don't follow hockey then i suppose 

153.85 159.65 A: yeah [lipsmack] no not really um i have a couple of friends who really like hockey but 

159.70 164.33 A: i just never got into hockey i know it's really popular in [laughter] but 

164.47 165.42 B: yeah 

164.65 167.71 A: um yeah and i mean 

167.71 180.41 A: i'm pretty much game for watching or i was when i had cable t._v. i would watch you know whatever was on and so i you know i've watched a few hockey games but um now that i don't have it i really 

180.22 188.08 A: like i honestly watch maybe three nights of t._v. a week and that's probably just like catching the news um so 

185.62 186.48 B: yeah 

188.25 196.36 A: yeah but i would i'd be willing to watch more hockey you know or if if my boyfriend got more involved in hockey i'm sure i'd go to the games or something but [lipsmack] 

195.50 198.69 B: yeah does he does he play hockey at all 

199.24 212.33 A: um i think he did a little bit when he was younger but um but now you know he plays golf more and um but nah football sometimes but but mainly golf 

202.01 202.83 B: oh 

212.03 219.26 B: yeah i i think i think the topic was was also how how many hours a week do we spend 

219.05 231.65 B: watching professional sports of t._v. and and i really would have to give a zero for that because maybe if i watched sports on t._v. it it'll probably be about um 

219.56 220.47 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

224.96 225.90 A: yeah 

231.89 236.92 B: less than once a month so maybe maybe ten hours in a year 

234.19 235.38 A: (( yeah uh )) 

237.28 239.45 B: is basically what i 

237.47 238.88 A: it it 

239.34 248.67 A: it's the same thing for me i mean like i said i watch maybe thirty minutes to an hour of t._v. or and that's spread over the whole week and you know they don't 

246.92 247.59 B: (( uh )) 

248.66 262.43 A: i know sometimes they play the sports on i get only like n. n._b._c. and the major check on a._b._c. c._b._s. um but like i don't know they don't uh i really don't watch sports anymore i used to watch all the time 

255.28 256.21 B: yeah 

262.31 266.05 A: like on e._s._p._n. but um now not so much 

264.20 265.07 B: yeah 

265.85 266.83 B: uh-huh 

266.07 268.92 A: i have a very low answer too [laughter] 

268.88 271.15 B: [laughter] well 

270.19 272.34 A: but yeah 

271.99 281.47 B: well [laughter] what about uh what about with when you're talking about boyfriends it's uh you you're probably of the younger generation what about um 

273.50 274.73 A: that's okay yeah 

281.48 285.32 B: the the college teams and that what about the um 

285.59 289.83 B: oh what is it everybody watches on new year's day all those bowls 

290.04 296.97 A: oh um you know i'd i do like i'm i'm actually not that young i'm twenty seven but uh [laughter] 

296.11 301.31 B: oh well i'm sixty [laughter] so you're young [laughter] 

297.92 299.28 A: oh okay [laughter] 

300.16 303.99 A: yeah oh i'm not in college i'm not like college young so [laughter] 

303.36 305.08 B: no okay [laughter] 

304.24 312.27 A: but um but i don't watch college i never even when i was in college i didn't watch the college sports as much but um 

311.01 311.97 B: yeah 

312.08 319.39 A: i went to a women's college anyway and they didn't really have you know didn't have the teams in basketball and football [mn] 

319.81 324.78 A: they they did but they didn't have them like a coed school would 

324.28 332.85 B: yeah yeah yeah so do you think that um that there's too much sport professional sports on television these days 

325.15 326.14 A: um 

333.03 336.34 B: um i i know you said you don't really watch 

336.29 349.60 A: yeah when i used i mean i had cable last year and i would watch last year but i would watch it on like e._s._p._n. they'd have the games and you know that's a channel just for sports so that's understandable 

337.12 338.30 B: (( much t- )) 

349.28 350.24 B: yeah 

349.75 363.48 A: and then they'd have um you know on the weekends sometimes on the major stations but i i don't think it's too much because i i mean it doesn't focus all on the one sport you know there there are varied sports that are 

355.11 356.04 B: uh-huh 

363.42 369.57 A: that are shown and like i don't find professional sports on t._v. annoying but i find like 

369.77 376.49 A: a lot of those reality shows annoying [laughter] so i'd rather get rid of the reality shows than sports [laughter] 

372.05 373.77 B: mhm mhm 

376.42 386.06 B: yeah but you know you mentioned that that they're they're and and i'm just as you're talking i'm thinking there are there are channels that are sp- specific sports channels 

386.02 399.12 B: and i i or uh specific golf channels and that type of thing and i think that's terrific mind you it's um if you don't have cable i don't think you have access to that but at least i find i have a choice 

392.05 392.85 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

398.89 400.59 A: yeah exactly 

399.51 410.61 B: um now living here in canada w- w- when i was younger it was uh say every saturday night it was called hockey night in canada um and uh that was that was before cable 

408.01 408.81 A: oh 

410.48 417.81 B: so you were pretty well forced to watch hockey every saturday night i found that annoying because no i'm not interested in it 

410.62 411.57 A: yeah 

417.13 419.45 A: [laughter] yeah 

418.02 426.84 B: at at all and uh well right now i s- i do know it's the stanley cup play offs and uh it's the big thing but i'm certainly 

424.26 425.26 A: uh-huh 

425.98 426.97 A: yeah 

426.96 431.53 B: you you know i catch it on the news as to who's um who's playing 

431.30 443.76 B: you know it's funny that i'm here in vancouver in canada and and there's a big game tonight between our hockey team and and minnesota and everybody's rooting for minnesota 

440.39 441.18 A: oh 

443.00 444.96 A: really why is that 

443.63 448.84 B: how's that how i don't know i guess they're better players maybe 

446.21 447.87 A: [laughter] 

448.87 453.48 B: if i watched i'd probably find out [laughter] 

448.95 449.99 A: oh 

452.69 455.55 A: [laughter] that's funny though [laughter] 

455.00 459.60 B: it is yeah i just happened to hear that on on the radio [lipsmack] 

459.28 461.82 A: oh 'cause usually um 

460.02 460.87 B: yeah 

461.81 470.88 A: like a team they they like to play at home 'cause it's like a home court or whatever advantage and they have the fans on their side to give them a little extra boost but 

467.19 468.17 B: yeah 

470.78 471.65 B: yeah 

470.80 479.44 A: if um the fans are rooting for the other team when they're playing at home [laughter] it could work against them yeah work against them but 

475.21 478.68 B: that's pretty sad yeah it is 

479.19 485.21 B: it is it is now did you say you have done this this um fisher thing before 

480.83 481.58 A: (( oh well )) 

485.40 490.31 A: um i did it just once before just the other night so this is my second time 

487.80 488.51 B: oh 

488.55 489.46 B: yeah 

490.07 492.27 B: oh me too me too 

491.36 494.82 A: yeah yeah so i guess it's just one more we can do 

492.47 493.46 B: yeah 

495.17 496.82 B: oh is that right 

496.54 501.96 A: yeah i think i think they said three max but then they might choose some more people to do some more 

501.63 515.49 B: [noise] yeah or if you have five phones or something i i'm not sure i'm not even sure that it it's it's actually um working up here in canada because the like there's no state to enter or there's no 

504.79 506.46 A: yeah yeah 

515.22 522.47 A: oh well as long as they have your address you put in the fields right then they should be able to pay you like that 

515.92 517.63 B: real address so 

522.38 527.06 B: uh yeah but there's no room for a zip code or anything 

526.92 532.11 A: huh is there maybe there's a phone number you can c- on the website i didn't notice maybe
