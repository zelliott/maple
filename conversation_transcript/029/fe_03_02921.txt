53.21 54.66 B: mhm 

53.62 60.96 A: but now lately i haven't been watching as much i w- watch the play offs but i haven't had the time to watch every single game like i used to 

60.93 62.46 B: right 

61.33 65.17 A: and i watch the play offs for almost every sport i watch the hockey play offs i watch 

65.25 67.17 A: football play offs um

79.42 82.14 B: the you said the lakers were your favorite team 

81.62 82.68 A: yeah 

82.62 90.68 B: what do you think about all the coverage that they have of like the play offs like on all night every night and everything taking over regular programming 

90.33 96.44 A: oh i don't mind because i find the regular t._v. pretty boring anyway [laughter] at least the games are fun to watch 

96.26 97.29 B: right 

96.88 104.02 A: i i wo- i used to watch every team all weekend you know n._b._n. n._b._c. everything i just haven't been doing it as much as i used to 

104.11 109.55 A: um i have teenage sons that are into it and they watch it all the time [mn] 

104.14 105.54 B: right 

109.51 124.32 B: right most ti- uh most people that i talk to they like don't watch the n._b._a. until like the play offs because they say during the season it's not really as competitive as it should be but during the play offs it's like win or lose uh i mean we don't go home 

124.20 128.08 B: and so it's like better competition what do you think about that 

126.87 139.98 A: yeah i heard people say that but when i was really into it i enjoyed every game and i like to watch it's just fun to watch and certain teams were more fun to watch than others you know and certain match ups but 

130.93 132.26 B: yeah me too 

140.00 142.57 A: if you enjoy the sport and enjoy your team 

142.59 153.79 A: you get really into it i got to know a lot about it each individual player and you have your favorites that you root for and even your bench warmers that you're always hoping are going [laughter] to get in there and get their chance [mn] 

149.52 151.34 B: (( right )) 

151.80 154.50 B: yeah right 

154.75 158.55 B: what are you what do you think about the salaries that the players receive 

159.49 167.96 A: hm i think they are kind of ridiculous in a way but people make so much money off of them i mean why shouldn't they get 

166.01 167.33 B: yeah 

168.10 172.61 A: a big chunk of it i i don't know w- should we- should the owners get all the money that 

173.05 179.91 A: you know they market them so much and make so much off of them they should be the ones to benefit the most from their name and their 

180.37 182.43 A: being yeah 

180.52 192.61 B: abilities uh yeah [lipsmack] i feel the same way i mean the um industry makes so much money and the owners you know they profit so much from like sales from you know the arenas the 

186.48 187.54 A: right 

191.95 192.89 A: mhm 

192.61 207.37 B: you know the um shirts and caps and all this and you know i do think the athletes make a lot of money but [lipsmack] i mean they are the ones out there s- you know sweating and getting hurt and running up and down the court 

196.06 197.12 A: right 

204.22 205.32 A: mhm 

206.79 209.65 A: right they should be the ones to benefit [laughter] 

207.28 208.54 B: so i mean you can 

208.95 215.23 B: yeah so it's kind of like up in the air for me because i mean if they don't get it who's going to get it [laughter] 

214.47 218.02 A: right why should someone else profit from their name and their 

215.24 217.10 B: (( so and )) 

218.33 219.56 A: talent 

219.14 221.40 B: their abil- yeah so cool 

220.60 226.13 A: so you know i don't know maybe i know a lot of people it is ridiculous the amounts of money they're getting paid now but 

226.20 231.27 A: the money's being made i mean if they'd reduce the prices so we could actually go to a game that would be great but 

231.23 233.94 B: i know it's like the prices are going up 

231.71 232.67 A: [laughter] 

233.81 240.76 A: yeah i can't afford to take my kids to the game i mean we've only gone a few times it's expensive here well i live in l._a. so [mn] 

240.24 241.71 B: oh you do oh okay 

240.92 250.81 A: yeah so to see the lakers you know you're talking probably for the three of us a hundred and fifty dollars by the time you park and go there and get a ticket that's anywhere near decent 

247.09 248.30 B: wild 

250.85 261.91 B: yeah 'cause i know that um just like a couple of years ago the mavericks were like terrible and you can get a ticket for like a good ticket for like eight to ten dollars now [laughter] 

260.78 261.54 A: oh 

262.24 271.92 B: tickets are like a hundred and something a nice ticket is at least fifty dollars so it means like almost triple triple quadruple since you know they started winning 

267.00 268.16 A: yeah 

270.34 278.90 A: yeah a good ticket in l._a. is three hundred dollars during the regular season well forget it you're not even going unless you're rich 

273.43 274.62 B: wow 

277.01 278.65 B: yeah 

278.98 279.99 B: right 

279.53 285.63 A: so i mean if they could reduce that and then reduce their salaries that would be great but it's not going to happen so [laughter] 

285.99 286.56 B: (( [mn] )) 

286.71 295.35 B: what do you think about the kobe and um shaq little whatever they had or whatever of the teams the team this year 'cause i like the lakers too 

295.24 303.17 B: 'cause the mavericks always seem to lose in the first or second round so i have to move to another team and the lakers that's my team that i think will go all the way [laughter] 

299.29 300.19 A: yeah 

302.09 308.19 A: yeah um you know i i didn't follow the regular season as much as i usually do so i don't know um 

306.71 307.49 B: mhm 

308.70 312.11 A: you know i think well shaq was out for quite a while 

311.86 313.40 B: yeah he was hurt 

312.20 313.01 A: so 

313.10 314.08 A: um 

315.51 319.61 A: you know i don't know that much about this season everything that happened 

319.64 321.98 A: and i'm watching it now but 

322.13 322.78 A: (( [cough] )) 

323.67 326.30 A: you know i haven't been following it as much as i did 

326.55 333.76 A: they they get they're like the brothers i think they get along and they don't get along but then they usually come together i mean kobe had a great year 

330.99 332.67 B: right 

333.83 339.18 A: i think his best ever with all those forty point games in a row and 

339.41 341.52 A: broke some records i think so 

342.02 343.01 B: yeah 

343.08 353.04 B: i think um a lot of people complain about the play offs being on television but i think it's good especially with the war just being over it's a good pastime for people to get away from 

349.85 350.87 A: mhm 

353.04 360.44 B: you know the war coverage and all that type of thing and just kind of relax and look at some sports so 

354.51 355.48 A: right 

360.72 364.03 A: right yeah well it was always a good thing 'cause it's 

364.05 372.59 A: i i'm a single parent of two boys and it was something that we could always do together we always looked forward to laker games you know we'd get pizza or 

366.16 367.56 B: mhm 

373.04 382.11 A: g- get dinner and sit in front of the t._v. and that's something they would do with me you know even now they're fifteen and seventeen but there's not a lot that your boys want to do with their mom [laughter] 

376.78 378.56 B: [noise] oh yeah 

381.46 383.01 B: right 

382.13 389.45 A: it was something we shared in a common interest and we could always do that together we always did it was just fun for us [mn] 

387.07 387.86 B: yeah 

389.52 390.52 B: (( yeah it's a )) 

390.76 394.49 B: yeah you know a good family gathering just to sit around and 

392.79 393.85 A: (( right )) 

394.06 398.12 A: fun and there's a lot worse things you could be doing with your kids 

397.23 403.98 B: yeah that's what i'm saying it's not x rated i mean it's like all the stuff on television now is like you know so 

398.25 398.89 A: (( [laughter] )) 

399.23 400.54 A: (( right )) 

403.23 404.14 A: (( uh-huh )) 

404.65 406.00 B: (( mature )) 

405.62 410.68 A: right it was something we could do and just have fun doing it and it was a different 

410.84 416.43 A: game every night you're not going to see a rerun you know [laughter] it's going to be different [laughter] so it 

413.83 417.95 B: [noise] [mn] right that's true that's true i don't think i would like that 

416.54 419.99 A: was always exciting and we always enjoyed it 

420.13 423.35 B: so do you like football also or just really basketball 

421.93 428.70 A: um i like it when i watch it i have to have someone to root for i'm not re- i don't have like a team so i just 

429.06 441.28 A: if uh if i know like get to know any particular stories about the players then i'll root for them and i usually root for the underdog that's kind of how i am [laughter] when it comes time for the play offs in superbowl whoever they don't think's 

434.38 435.91 B: (( right [laughter] ))

549.90 553.88 A: i just grew away from that and it wasn't that exciting anymore 

554.14 566.47 A: it never was really that exciting i just really liked the players and we used to meet them all the time so it was fun back then but now you can't meet them because they're locked up there they don't park like out in the public area anymore for security 

567.31 569.81 B: what do you think about the w._n._b._a. 

570.21 574.99 A: you know i thought i would like it but you know it's just not the same [laughter]
