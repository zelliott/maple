81.24 87.28 B: [laughter] right [sigh] yeah i i tend to watch like i said i'm i'm a dodger fan so 

87.53 93.11 B: you know i keep up with [sigh] the team although this year they have kind of a lousy team [laughter] 

92.59 99.65 A: [laughter] well as [mn] the giant football's the same way they always have a lousy team but they do good once in a while [laughter] 

98.75 99.71 B: uh-huh 

100.04 106.86 B: mhm so [mn] how often do you watch 'em [mn] i mean do you watch 'em on t._v. at all or 

106.48 112.52 A: well usually w- yeah on t._v. we've been to a couple of giants games in new york at the stadium but 

112.90 113.82 B: uh-huh 

113.64 118.68 A: 'cause we didn't live too far we used to live closer but now we're in massachusetts we used to be in new york [laughter] 

118.32 119.53 B: oh uh-huh 

119.63 120.53 A: (( [noise] so )) 

120.44 121.32 B: oh 

120.59 125.98 A: that's i think that's why i started to like that team 'cause we had gone to see 'em a few times 

125.40 126.60 B: right right 

127.36 133.98 A: and like i said my husband really likes football so he'll watch all the games but i seem to only pay attention when the giants are on [laughter] wow 

127.60 128.97 B: yes i 

130.80 131.86 B: [laughter] 

133.36 144.78 B: right right well that's like my nephew he loves basketball he don't care who's playing basketball little kids big kids profe- you know [sigh] and can tell ya any and everything [laughter] about it 

144.03 144.78 A: (( great )) 

145.21 160.11 B: but um no i i go to dodger games i've been going to the games um [lipsmack] gosh for about fifteen years now i guess [sigh] and i'm getting ready to go to another one next week [laughter] 

159.37 163.18 A: it's much better when you can go in person instead of watching 'em on tv 

162.29 171.53 B: [sigh] right right but sometimes i like i i prefer 'em on t._v. because sometimes you know they have like controversial calls and things 

171.00 173.46 A: [laughter] right you know what's going on a little bit better 

172.87 180.35 B: right and they'll show you the replays and you get to they'll slow it down you can say oh yeah he was out you know or [laughter] 

178.91 180.44 A: yeah that's true 

180.30 189.70 B: [sigh] you know whatever they stopped doing that at the stadiums they used to do replays and stuff but they they stopped doing that because you know if an umpire's 

189.64 196.99 B: makes a bad call you know they're i mean it's then you can't go back and change it and the fans get all kinda crazy 

191.26 192.13 A: right 

196.39 197.71 A: right [laughter] 

197.17 199.02 B: [laughter] you know so it's like 

197.96 199.91 A: (( have a riot on your hands [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah )) 

199.18 203.18 B: [laughter] right right [sigh] oh so [lipsmack] 

203.33 211.51 B: i guess that's why i don't go to football games the only football game that i went to [sigh] raiders and somebody else i forgot about twenty years ago 

211.38 221.14 B: i mean those fans are crazy and that was twenty years ago and i can't ima- oh i couldn't go to one today [sigh] oh it's just scary [laughter] 

216.11 217.47 A: right yeah 

220.13 224.45 A: [laughter] and at least if you're home watching it on t._v. you don't have to worry about getting hurt or anything 

224.08 226.63 B: right right and you could turn 

225.26 227.75 A: [laughter] you can just watch and say oh my god look at this 

227.49 232.42 B: right right [laughter] you know you can turn if off [laughter] 

228.39 229.12 A: [laughter] 

231.57 232.75 A: right [laughter] 

232.78 235.92 B: you can go and come back [laughter] and pick it up you know 

235.44 236.40 A: (( yeah [laughter] ))
