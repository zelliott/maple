92.48 103.57 B: it's um it's [laughter] kind of interesting i i don't know why i like to watch it i just find it kind of um hilarious to watch these five hundred pound guys moving these incredibly huge weights 

103.70 112.66 A: yeah i um i've seen that one time uh they had some kind of competition where they had to pull these trucks 

112.54 120.94 A: they had these dead weights that they had to lift and carry a certain distance between their legs um 

118.49 121.15 B: exactly exactly 

121.11 122.24 A: and 

121.46 124.53 B: by throwing blocks over their heads over these walls

126.04 127.92 B: yeah 

127.40 136.53 A: you know i just thought to myself if i even thought of doing something like that i would have completely you know paralysed myself

141.51 142.94 A: oh yeah 

142.34 151.23 B: one time they had to run seventy five yards carrying an anvil and i was just thinking to myself i couldn't even push an anvil [laughter] much less run with it 

150.49 153.99 A: it it really is incredible uh [mn] 

152.43 159.02 B: yeah do you watch uh do you watch all the n._f._l. teams or do you just pick your favorite team 

158.11 164.36 A: uh really i'm i'm kind of limited to what comes on in my area i um 

164.34 177.02 A: limited myself uh i i used to have direct t._v. but then decided that i was watching uh too much that we as a family were watching too much t._v. 

169.35 170.52 B: yeah 

176.98 180.36 B: i had to turn off my cable yeah 

177.10 178.25 A: and we 

178.92 181.85 A: and we turned if off uh 

182.15 188.24 A: so we're just watching what's what's on the airways you know in the local area 

187.66 194.08 B: [noise] [noise] i took it a step further i uh i turned off my cable completely and i just got rid of my television 

194.09 195.33 A: oh really 

194.11 198.66 B: so whenever i yeah whenever i watch television it's at the bar or at a friend's house

202.43 212.61 B: it was uh it was either that or just give up all other hobbies and i couldn't do it like i had to have uh i had to have other hobbies and television wasn't wasn't going to be included in it anymore 

212.46 215.07 A: yeah i uh well i 

215.35 220.77 A: i uh don't go that far uh i still have a uh 

220.63 221.38 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

221.03 223.53 A: a young son uh who's uh 

223.58 226.41 A: you know thirteen years old and uh 

226.33 230.35 B: can't get rid of television then completely with a thirteen year old around 

228.80 237.58 A: no and i i encourage him to watch uh public t._v. and that's really our favorite channel um [sigh] 

236.47 240.06 B: oh yeah yeah what time of the day do you usually watch [noise] 

238.00 238.75 A: (( and )) 

240.06 243.03 A: oh it's uh when i get home in the evening 

242.87 245.95 B: [noise] mm me too yeah 

243.37 244.22 A: uh 

245.09 256.27 A: uh and uh then on weekends uh and uh then i uh i like to watch the british comedies those are usually my favorites 

253.01 255.70 B: oh yeah those are quite good 

256.65 270.55 B: it was bad with television i mean like with sports especially on the east coast i would have to stay up until about you know one in the morning if i was watching a hockey game and it went into overtime so for me television just became too much of a time drain 

270.48 279.03 B: like you know with basketball being a four hour game or football being a four three and a half to four hour game it's it was just too much time for me after a while 

278.56 282.36 A: yeah you know i i grew up in chicago 

282.41 284.80 A: and hockey of course was 

284.25 285.96 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

286.28 287.16 B: yes 

287.74 289.13 A: what was that 

288.91 291.17 B: hockey was the one you watched the most [noise] 

290.47 298.53 A: oh uh no uh well i i used to uh to to watch hockey uh went to a game um but um 

298.41 313.05 A: one of the things uh that that always uh kind of turned me off even though it really is uh i guess a big draw where the most fans uh even though most fans don't admit it is the fact that uh 

312.88 322.50 A: it's uh the the violence the fights you know some of the some of the best fights i've ever seen [laughter] have been in a in a hockey rink 

317.30 319.11 B: yeah 

319.69 321.03 B: [laughter] 

321.90 325.08 B: yeah or a baseball diamond for that matter [laughter] 

322.65 323.48 A: uh 

324.46 327.68 A: or well yeah but but you know 

326.85 330.08 B: mostly the hockey the hockey guys are really crazy 

329.25 341.73 A: yeah they really really are i would daresay that uh most of those toothless smiles come from those right wings and left hooks you know with the specially with the hockey sticks uh 

338.54 340.51 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

341.61 349.52 B: between the redwings and the colorado avalanche i think in one in one season alone they had three to four different fights 

349.53 354.18 B: and some of these fights would go on for ten minutes it was uh it was incredible to watch 

354.28 357.80 A: oh it it really is something else uh but uh 

358.29 359.46 A: i um 

360.22 370.04 A: i i i for some reason just couldn't um uh find that much interest uh in in in that particular sport uh 

370.29 375.88 A: but my my wife uh she enjoys basketball and that's uh 

371.11 371.71 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

375.81 390.46 A: you know when when when the n._b._a. finals uh come on that's uh what you'll find uh most of the time uh er on the weekends you know those those games will be on t._v. and when when she's home uh both of us will be watching that uh 

386.72 387.93 B: right 

390.01 392.94 B: well that's great that you guys watch it as a whole family 

392.28 402.12 A: yeah um you know that well that's one of the reasons why i particularly wa- like to watch it because both of us enjoy it uh 

401.57 403.30 B: oh that's great 

402.45 404.13 A: and and that's uh 

404.28 409.60 A: you know when when when you've got you know the whole family looking at it you know it uh 

409.65 416.33 A: i'm not saying it's quality time [laughter] but it comes close to it yeah yeah and it uh 

412.36 419.49 B: at least you're together yeah like whenever i watch sport it's definitely with friends around the television 

419.69 426.34 B: it's you know watching television alone is okay but it's it's usually better to watch especially sporting events with friends [noise] 

425.63 435.56 A: oh yeah yeah you know i i guess most of the enjoyment comes from making those comments and uh expressing your opinion as to how the play could have been better 

435.28 437.55 B: yeah yeah 

436.09 439.43 A: and um how to improve it the next time but 

439.45 440.64 B: [noise] totally 

440.73 442.18 A: so um 

442.54 444.19 B: [noise] the um 

443.04 443.67 A: (( i )) 

444.47 447.25 B: the best thing that's going on right now is that uh 

447.56 460.95 B: uh living out here in los angeles and watching the lakers play and my home team the pistons are still in it so i'm i'm hoping against hope that the pistons stay in it long enough to make it all the way to the finals so they can play the lakers 

460.58 461.79 A: oh yeah 

460.90 466.47 B: that way i can watch my home team and and my new home team play at the same time 

466.02 468.23 A: now uh how 

468.34 471.61 A: lakers are still in contention aren't they uh they're 

471.05 481.12 B: lakers just uh they just completed uh the first round they they beat the uh jeeze who did they beat 

480.99 490.10 B: i can't remember who they just beat but they uh they advanced to the second round and the pistons did too by [sigh] winning their seventh game they had to come back the pistons were down 

490.53 495.69 B: i think they were down three one and they came all the way back to win it four to three 

494.85 496.52 A: well that's great [mn] yeah 

495.92 498.51 B: yeah it was it was amazing [laughter] series 

498.88 510.12 B: but unfortunately for me the hockey team uh redwings lost in the very first round to the mighty ducks and that just that just killed it for me i mean when your team ex- exits first round that just hurts 

509.43 516.17 A: [laughter] yeah i'm not laughing at that but i but i know what you mean yeah [laughter] 

514.85 526.21 B: it was it was it was bad 'cause i you know i spent a hundred dollars to go to the game over here in uh anaheim and and it was game four and that was the last game they lost and i was just like oh look at that great timing 

518.92 520.07 A: oh gee

563.64 574.31 B: the uh watching uh sporting events for the university of michigan i mean those games held a lot more interest for me than any of the other uh professional games out there [noise] [noise] 

574.27 582.05 A: oh yeah i you know there there's another sport uh growing up in chicago i came to uh appreciate softball
