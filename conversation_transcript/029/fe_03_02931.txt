453.69 458.17 A: thinking they're too funny and too important then more important than sports so 

458.36 460.95 A: i quit watching that i uh 

461.22 464.83 A: i used to watch a lot more than i do i think i'm thirty two 

464.96 468.84 A: and i think every year i watch less sports and care less about it and 

468.02 473.21 B: [noise] [mn] well you just get busy especially with a baby i mean it just becomes less important 

472.60 475.77 A: yeah i would agree that's a pretty good way to put it as a 

475.81 479.73 B: you don't have time to sit around and watch t._v. if you have a two year old 

478.30 482.25 A: is there uh is there like a home team like is it uh 

482.24 483.81 B: yeah we have the packers 

482.55 486.54 A: the vikings and the the badgers okay so is that like 

487.16 489.16 A: definitely watching that 

488.55 490.96 B: we have the packers and the badgers yeah and then 

490.36 493.12 A: and rooting hard big time 

493.54 502.36 B: well pretty much because our our we have uh you know we're from green bay and the population's like a hundred thousand so to have an n._f._l. football team in a small town it's 

493.73 494.84 A: for 'em 

502.29 503.24 A: yeah 

502.69 504.39 B: it's a pretty big deal 

504.28 505.15 A: ah 

505.26 509.28 A: yeah see we've only been in dallas for like five years so i don't have a real loyalty for 

509.52 513.61 A: for any of the teams here so i don't really watch 'em on t._v. have you been to a game do you go 

509.59 510.58 B: okay 

511.74 514.41 B: do you go to do you actually go to the games 

514.06 518.95 A: (( i've been no i've only been to like to two cowboys games my whole life ever before i even lived here what about you all )) 

516.56 517.48 B: okay 

518.76 527.04 B: yeah we go my husband goes to way more than i do but i mean it's just part of even recreation on the weekends to go out and 

525.96 528.05 A: isn't it like impossible to get tickets 

527.83 529.58 B: no it's very possible 

529.44 530.99 A: (( huh okay )) 

529.92 533.98 B: because it's shareholders own all the tickets so 

534.04 538.82 B: to to know of a friend that has season tickets it's it's easy to get them 

538.71 542.40 A: ah are the games always on t._v. or are they they're always sold out aren't they 

542.44 547.74 B: yeah they're always sold out and yeah they are they are always on t._v. as well 

543.85 544.69 A: okay 

547.59 552.81 A: so they all like have a big party and plan the weekend around it or is it just a just like any other game on t._v. 

552.99 554.99 B: in oh no every i mean 

556.04 566.58 B: every weekend there's like packer parties and the bars all like center their weekends around them and the hotels and everything it's it's a pretty big deal in green bay [laughter] 

566.43 569.73 A: so watching the games on t._v. will you watch it at home or do you go to a bar 

569.91 571.28 B: it just sometimes i 

570.02 573.00 A: if you're assuming the ki- assuming the kid's not in the picture 

572.06 576.68 B: yeah it it just depends on the weekend and what we have going on otherwise 

576.28 577.22 A: okay 

577.77 578.91 A: okay 

578.28 579.04 B: (( so )) 

580.10 586.72 B: and then and then the badger football team is pretty important [noise] as well yeah 

584.93 585.97 A: really 

585.99 586.99 A: okay 

587.01 588.10 A: (( i uh )) 

588.69 595.19 A: 'cause they're coach alvarez yeah i i've watched them some they were i think i think i watched them in a ballgame this year 

594.84 595.81 B: okay 

595.65 597.50 A: i think i'm not even sure 

596.77 599.95 B: when ron dane was doing really well do you remember that
