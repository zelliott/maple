233.88 234.79 B: right 

234.51 235.75 A: so interesting 

235.46 238.68 B: yeah 'cause i signed up yesterday i'm surprised they called already 

238.39 250.96 A: yeah yeah i mean i literally i literally signed up yesterday so i thought you know it would be like you know you enter a queue somewhere and you could be somewhere down the line and be sporadic at that but it's pretty uh pretty rapid turn around and you've done a 

249.81 250.62 B: (( [noise] so i )) 

250.85 252.31 B: i'm sorry 

251.56 254.24 A: i'm sorry you've done a couple of these or already

262.36 263.07 A: (( [noise] ))

274.57 276.11 A: (( all right so i )) 

274.83 275.83 B: (( [cough] ))

278.92 280.04 B: i'm sorry 

279.91 286.09 A: i wonder why they have you focus on pets in- intonation and stuff like that and why that 

284.05 287.57 B: i don't know i think they just give you a topic to talk about 

286.96 288.85 A: yeah free range 

289.50 290.14 A: (( mm )) 

289.50 295.81 B: i mean the one they gave the initial one they gave uh was kinda funny i'm just trying to think of what it was i know it made me laugh 

295.63 296.57 A: [laughter] 

296.24 297.04 B: oh 

297.36 300.86 B: if you could uh give up talking to your best friend 

300.32 301.15 A: (( mm )) 

302.21 305.21 B: or have a million dollars which would you choose 

304.62 307.45 A: [laughter] no question 

307.00 308.34 B: [laughter] 

307.56 317.57 A: [laughter] well heck i got or maybe i'd give up talking to my best friend and got that million dollars and then i'd sort of talk with them through the internet or you know do a friend liaison or something 

317.58 321.74 B: right and i thought that was an interesting topic 'cause i had to think about that one 

319.93 321.01 A: (( yeah well )) 

321.49 328.72 A: yeah well yeah if it was like if it was a hard rule that would probably be a lot harder you know moral ver- or moral versus actual immediate reward [noise] 

329.50 330.88 A: (( i think )) 

329.79 331.97 B: [noise] but i think i'd take the money 

331.57 335.42 A: yeah yeah well it's like it's you know basically you work the rest of your life or uh 

336.02 344.22 A: you know or give up one person it's you know as good as is or at least i mean even though you're giving no to that person they're still your friend it's just that you can't talk to them 

343.64 344.94 B: right [noise] 

344.53 345.16 A: (( mm )) 

345.42 349.33 A: yeah i think you're right because it's a long i think it's a big sacrifice to make 

348.35 351.50 B: well if you gave them a little bit of it they wouldn't mind either 

351.31 359.43 A: yeah right yeah yeah you get that and you can't talk to 'em but you figure send some their way and you're both hey even split you know you're both happy [noise] that's 

354.42 355.04 B: (( [cough] )) 

357.34 358.23 B: yeah

373.77 377.48 A: i guess they i'd imagine they do this like general all over the united states 

377.35 378.66 B: i guess so 

378.79 380.93 B: yeah i'm calling from philadelphia 

380.89 383.56 A: (( [noise] yeah you're in a landmark ))

389.68 390.63 B: (( [noise] )) 

392.51 393.47 B: (( right [noise] )) 

393.33 395.29 A: but uh [laughter] yeah they're 

395.45 399.89 A: mm kind- it's kinda uh dead today but plenty of worse things to do 

400.37 405.10 A: what kind of st- what kind of stuff do you do i mean i'm i'm a programmer so i write code but 

404.63 411.50 B: um i just work i'm i'm doing scheduling i do scheduling for the technicians here it's a fire inspection service 

409.27 409.92 A: (( mm ))

412.78 415.29 A: big place or like a big old mm 

414.73 419.77 B: it's a big warehouse but i mean there's only like about fifteen twenty people that work here 

419.60 422.64 A: okay so more space than actual you know crammed in there 

422.06 423.16 B: (( right [noise] )) 

423.13 424.09 A: that's cool 

424.68 436.53 A: yeah no i guess they're they are actually uh this is the manufacturing place so they have uh you know they have like a front office area you know with like you know all staff people and then you like walk out on the other side of the building and there's this huge manufacturing plant with all kinds of gear 

436.57 438.28 A: strewn around 

438.90 439.74 A: (( it's uh )) 

440.34 442.68 B: but you work in the offices correct [noise] 

440.35 441.36 A: (( [lipsmack] different )) 

441.93 452.83 A: yeah yeah i work i'm working on my ass doing programming and stuff like that supporting you know supporting out those guys out there immediately but the guys who use the information are you know try and get at the information but 

453.13 453.86 A: (( you know )) 

454.94 456.36 A: i guess their information 

456.66 457.54 B: mhm 

458.61 462.52 B: okay we've been talking for nine minutes fifty seconds 

460.47 461.64 A: yep eight 

462.25 470.09 A: yeah so it should be cutting off pretty soon i have eight minutes and forty five seconds so it should be cutting off [laughter] i'm sure people run out of stuff you know 

465.44 466.66 B: oh okay 

470.21 473.25 A: i don't know if we're allowed to talk of other things or if there was a monitor or 

473.38 475.15 A: you know big brother was watching yeah 

473.61 476.51 B: well i they're just trying to get the voice really 

475.88 477.10 A: yeah 

477.16 479.28 B: what is it linguistics or something 

479.07 485.58 A: yeah i think i think it's some kind of voice recognition program or you know they're trying to improve some kind of outer rhythm for voice recognition 

485.54 486.46 B: right 

486.98 491.50 A: seems neat i'd love to you know sorta see what happened you know if it actually makes an improvement 

490.53 491.69 B: [laughter] 

492.30 495.00 B: i didn't see any improvement after the cellphone one 

494.93 501.89 A: yeah was there i mean do you what is it actually electronic they improve or like what is it that they actually kinda produce 

500.50 503.39 B: i really don't know what they're trying to find out 

503.10 504.76 A: mhm it will be 

503.57 509.60 B: i thought maybe the different people's backgrounds and the way they spoke in different areas 

509.50 511.23 A: yeah 

511.28 515.69 A: maybe that's the sort of thing that you have information that that then can be you know factored into 

515.95 518.47 A: [noise] you know programs that are sold or or you know 

518.85 520.70 A: i don't know maybe different features 

521.19 525.69 A: like you know now that you can you can use your voice to uh call somebody on a cellphone 

525.46 526.46 B: mhm 

526.07 527.45 A: it's that kind of stuff you 

527.73 529.01 A: don't see it right away 

530.59 532.25 A: i almost have ten minutes 

532.61 533.75 B: oh really 

533.46 537.52 A: yeah i ten minutes just now but i'm sure there's like another minute where 

537.67 540.65 A: you have to like dial into the system or something like that [noise] 

540.34 545.30 B: oh 'cause i have eleven something but that's when they called and they had to patch through 

543.31 544.82 A: yeah yeah 

545.26 546.31 A: yeah 

546.32 552.13 A: no mine starts like at right at the like i say i think it's as soon as it actually picked up on me or as soon as it started ringing so 

552.53 553.89 A: another minute or so 

553.00 555.17 B: did they call you or did you call in 

554.89 559.15 A: they called me i didn't know you could actually call call them at all they just said 

557.98 560.29 B: yeah you can they give you a password 

560.03 560.85 A: huh 

560.87 566.76 B: so i'm gonna try i was gonna do that today actually 'cause i said i'd call between i said i wanted calls between two and four 

566.49 567.50 A: mhm 

566.87 570.99 B: and they called be- well i guess they called right almost just before two [noise] i'm 

570.81 574.01 A: actually yeah you're right two two o'clock on the dot so that's 

574.47 578.50 A: i'm surprised because an automated system just makes those calls or connects the calls 

579.00 580.57 A: has a cue [mn] 

580.96 582.47 A: that's pretty cool 

581.26 584.60 B: waiting for someone to walk in saying what are you doing on the phone so long 

584.54 586.67 A: [laughter] 

587.32 590.13 B: (( 'cause usually i'm on and off on and off [noise] )) 

589.68 590.99 A: yeah 

591.60 597.09 A: yeah i guess i you know i rarely use the phone usually it's all like electronic based i can actually see it before it comes in [noise] 

596.99 598.12 B: uh-huh
