101.94 102.85 B: uh-huh 

108.48 110.45 B: round yeah

115.87 117.32 A: mhm 

116.67 125.30 B: um and i had friends who were very interested in hockey and that's kind of a nice fast moving sport just a little just a little too violent for my tastes frankly 

121.76 123.16 A: yeah 

124.50 126.81 A: it's yeah and 

126.89 141.38 A: baseball is definitely too slow moving i i i did at one time i used to watch some basketball and like right now i have people um liv- uh living around me who watch basketball but i just 

129.39 130.27 B: (( [noise] )) 

130.87 131.69 B: mhm 

134.26 135.13 B: uh-huh

140.25 141.50 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

141.78 152.17 A: i don't really have um time to watch and as far as like teams i used to kind of follow teams just by list- by listening to what the scores were because 

143.57 144.41 B: uh-huh 

148.47 149.52 B: oh really 

151.51 153.97 B: where are you watching from or talking from

173.23 175.04 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

175.44 184.63 B: uh i i hardly ever watch t._v. though you know so i hardly watch sport you know i mean the olympics certainly don't happen more than once every four years 

183.89 185.00 A: right 

185.12 187.84 B: so i don't watch them more often than that 

187.22 188.19 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

188.48 191.33 B: but i have friends who watch baseball and thin- 

191.37 193.68 B: think it's so wonderful i saw 

193.78 194.79 B: (( uh )) 

194.81 204.23 B: anger management and there was something from yankee stadium there or allegedly from yankee stadium and with the former mayor guiliani 

204.30 207.87 B: and i and he was a big baseball fan 

207.11 208.93 A: mhm yeah 

207.99 215.81 B: you know that's about all i think of that but i you know i really don't i would never watch baseball on on television you couldn't pay me to do it 

215.21 220.22 A: i know it's i can't imagine like sitting down and spending 

220.37 225.26 A: spending the better part of a day watching a game when there's so much else to do i 

221.99 222.96 B: yeah 

224.55 229.23 B: yeah yeah or just doing nothing rather than that frankly as far as i'm 

225.57 226.58 A: so 

228.68 230.29 A: yeah 

229.49 234.59 B: concerned but you know as i said i i could watch tennis but i i don't you know 

234.42 235.57 A: yeah 

234.62 236.30 B: (( don't do it very much )) 

236.86 240.39 B: and don't really watch any sports on t._v. i mean 

241.15 242.07 B: (( i can't )) 

241.40 255.74 A: yeah if i had like there's a guy living in this in the dorm and like um who is like on the football teams and like plays basketball and so he watches like a lot of sports and um 

246.75 247.65 B: uh-huh 

250.03 250.93 B: uh-huh 

251.84 252.92 B: oh really 

253.26 254.10 B: uh-huh 

254.60 255.55 B: uh-huh 

255.84 269.50 A: but i don't really i i used to dance so i you know um um i i've never really i never really played on a sports on any kind of sports team which would probably have made me more interested in watching it but 

258.84 259.74 B: uh-huh 

265.65 266.98 B: [laughter] 

267.86 270.83 B: yeah neither did i. [laughter] 

269.89 274.52 A: yeah so that that that aspect of it is not there for me 

274.11 276.74 B: yeah yeah not for me either 

276.54 277.72 A: yeah 

277.11 282.14 B: but i can understand how people get interested in you know their their speed and 

283.29 290.30 B: they like i had um one of my brothers um played basketball in um college 

290.76 302.21 B: oh it was high school and my other brother was in um law school at the time and out in west in a western city and and they were getting the chicago newspapers where my younger brother was 

301.96 303.05 A: mhm 

302.43 309.67 B: and reading about it and then he this same brother goes to basketball games college basketball they both live in the same western city now 

310.16 316.26 B: and i guess in that place basketball is a big deal i don't know whether they broadcast it or whatever 

312.97 314.09 A: yeah 

316.11 323.83 A: yeah especially like um my my family lives in in new mexico that is where 

322.90 324.16 B: oh mine too 

323.99 328.37 A: yeah really and there's not really any um 

324.86 325.86 B: uh-huh 

328.39 329.30 A: any 

329.50 333.07 A: like sports to go to as much 

331.75 334.61 B: they go to the basketball games from the university 

334.21 343.50 A: right well there's that and then but then like in a lot of in big cities you can go to the major league games that are in in town but i i think it's 

342.06 342.91 B: uh-huh 

343.31 349.40 A: there is more people who have to watch t._v. have to watch it on t._v. because of there's just 

347.33 348.20 B: uh-huh 

348.97 351.40 B: that it isn't there yeah 

349.94 351.65 A: right so 

351.96 353.42 A: um but 

352.64 354.25 B: yeah 

354.50 362.82 B: yeah uh i can imagine people watching hockey 'cause at least you know it moves around fast and 

362.24 363.17 A: (( uh-huh )) 

363.41 367.65 B: um you know and i guess there's interest in the players and stuff 

367.90 369.16 A: yeah 

368.58 369.46 B: uh-huh 

370.25 374.29 B: i guess football players too some of them seem to become um they've 

374.33 380.33 B: uh you know these major league major [cough] i don't know what they're called are they called leagues football leagues 

379.71 381.27 A: yeah 

380.66 381.61 B: um 

382.03 386.33 B: they become sports announcers after they retire and stuff 

386.08 387.42 A: yeah 

386.79 394.72 B: i knew somebody who had some business dealings once with joe namath and i guess that was broadcast i mean he when played it was broadcasted a lot 

394.19 395.32 A: mhm 

394.74 396.47 B: (( or broadcast a lot )) 

395.52 396.56 A: right 

396.95 407.58 A: yeah some people um they become very and i i had that with football they were i would i would start to enjoy watching the certain quarterbacks and so i would 

396.95 398.06 B: (( uh-huh )) 

401.93 402.88 B: uh-huh 

407.13 408.20 B: oh really 

407.60 409.22 A: yeah i'd like 

409.44 412.60 A: so then i would follow a team and be um 

412.58 413.64 A: and that's 

413.57 422.02 A: there was there was one time at one point when i was when i was really into football and would watch a lot and just like sit down and 

419.37 420.82 B: uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 

421.91 430.26 A: my it was very it was strange because my mom at the time was teaching me how to knit so i would be it was over a christmas break in school and 

426.69 427.43 B: uh-huh 

429.04 429.89 B: uh-huh 

429.93 430.74 B: uh-huh 

430.12 443.52 A: i was like i just spent my christmas break knitting and watching football and my parents would come home from work and be like what are you doing [laughter] but it was it was fun it was just kind of a one one good thing about watching sports is 

434.66 436.10 B: oh right 

437.57 438.52 B: uh-huh 

443.37 449.38 A: if it just to wind down is kind of a nice um um just mindless 

446.82 458.79 B: yeah i think i think a lot of people do watch them because of that and listen to them you know you hear in um tellies and whatnot that are talking about the score and 

451.75 452.76 A: right 

458.18 459.68 A: mhm 

459.06 473.88 B: i have a friend who um lives with this old guy up town he uh listens and watches to watches the baseball and his friends discuss they come over and discuss the scores and did they do well and where the pointers good and stuff 

473.14 479.04 A: mhm yeah it's just kind of a good way to connect and blow off steam and 

478.21 492.36 B: yeah and this guy used to play tennis but he's about ninety now and he's mostly wheelchair bound except for a little walking around his apartment and you know i i guess it's a kind of a way to wind down or blow off steam or whatever a fan decides 

484.78 485.82 A: mhm 

489.94 491.04 A: right 

492.07 493.24 A: right 

493.43 495.59 A: yeah it can be good that way 

495.13 507.90 B: yeah i remember when my father used to watch boxing he would spit on his hands [laughter] and get real excited about it it's so ridiculous in retrospect people beating each other up even if there's padded gloves it's kinda disgusting 

499.78 500.98 A: (( [laughter] )) 

503.17 504.21 A: yeah 

507.35 509.69 A: yeah yeah my dad played 

509.53 523.84 A: played baseball pretty seriously but he he doesn't like watching it they my parents my parents like watching golf and i don't know how i don't know how they can do that and whenever whenever they play whenever they're watching golf i just go shut myself in my room [noise] because it's just 

511.01 512.47 B: [noise] 

512.99 513.85 B: oh really 

515.67 516.77 B: oh really 

517.81 519.36 B: (( [laughter] )) 

520.90 521.46 B: (( [mn] )) 

522.66 523.87 B: uh-huh 

523.79 530.40 A: that's even like it's even even more slow moving than baseball but [lipsmack] and so 

527.70 528.57 B: uh-huh 

529.65 535.95 B: but it's it's just i think as well it seems a little nicer than baseball at least they're not running around in the dirt 

535.33 537.82 A: right yeah and there's 

536.95 537.75 B: uh-huh 

538.17 548.49 A: um somewhat more like there's different because there's different people going around at different times so they can move to different um sections of the course but so 

544.29 545.30 B: right 

546.23 547.09 B: uh-huh 

547.79 550.13 B: and sometimes the ball goes in the water 

549.59 552.18 A: yeah [laughter] and then it's kind of amusing 

551.74 554.25 B: yeah yeah 

552.38 553.63 A: but um 

554.47 555.41 A: um 

555.83 565.06 A: yeah i don't [mn] at this point i i really i don't i don't watch sports live and i don't watch on t._v. either because i just 

561.16 562.05 B: yeah 

563.77 565.75 B: yeah i don't either 

565.16 569.35 A: yeah there is not not too much of draw 

569.15 570.09 B: (( yeah that )) 

569.32 582.79 A: although it's i mean then there's when i'm around people of course that who watched who watch it and i kinda you sometime feel kind of um out of the loop but usually it's like oh well [laughter] 

574.16 575.91 B: [laughter] 

576.04 576.91 B: uh-huh 

578.78 579.62 B: uh-huh 

580.68 581.57 B: uh-huh 

582.78 586.19 A: it's not a big problem i i have other things to talk about 

585.63 587.79 B: yeah yeah 

586.64 587.52 A: but 

587.67 590.67 A: um it's it can be a big thing 

590.20 599.12 B: yeah especially around superbowl time i mean you see all these ads about the food for the parties sort of thing and all these people who do watch it 

592.28 593.57 A: exactly 

596.25 597.53 A: (( [noise] right )) 

598.94 599.95 A: yeah 

599.47 599.89 B: they
