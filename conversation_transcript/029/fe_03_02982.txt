21.18 26.88 A: uh i just stay too busy now to have an animal 'cause i'm we're on the go alot how about you [mn] [noise] mm 

26.10 36.38 B: i was actually raised on a farm when i was younger and don't live on a farm anymore but i have a seven week old kitten a couple of hamsters and a couple of cockatiels [laughter] 

37.07 43.04 B: that i love very much and actually here at four thirty we're gonna take the kitten to the vet 

43.59 46.47 B: 'cause we just adopted him from the pound last week [noise] 

46.28 52.89 A: well good for you good for you i'm a detective at the police department here in the town i work in and i just walked away from my animal control officer

56.85 58.23 B: (( oh wow [noise] )) 

57.56 62.59 A: uh i've managed to resist i'll take a cat or dog home occasionally if i know somebody wants one but 

62.91 64.56 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

63.32 67.44 B: that's actually what i wanna [mn] i'd love to be an animal control officer 

67.34 68.62 A: mhm 

67.72 74.47 B: 'cause i i think that's something that greatly needs improvement in our society is cruelty to animals 

74.27 76.36 A: it really does um 

75.52 88.28 B: i actually sat here all day yesterday and watched animal planet and commented on different shows and i like to watch animal precinct and animal cops and it makes me angry but it makes me wanna do something so 

88.08 99.06 A: yeah yeah well they the the guys here think that just 'cause i'm [mn] a girl i should get things that where you're supposed to care so i get most i get most of the dog the abuse cases 

95.41 97.09 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

99.10 100.69 B: yeah 

99.13 104.45 A: and uh it puts me two ways i either get so mad with the people i wanna go out and bring everyone one of them home 

104.10 105.15 B: yeah 

104.57 107.59 A: or i just run around and take everybody's animal away [laughter] 

108.22 112.41 B: well that's understandable 'cause most of 'em don't deserve 'em in the first place 

111.73 122.09 A: so right they call 'em pets and then and then you see the uh the pit bull and the rottweilers uh the the guys walking round town with them with a great big long chains i mean the kind of chain you'd 

122.58 128.96 A: look like it'd be strong enough to hold up a horse [lipsmack] and what they're doing in in and i live in penn here we have a problem just recent with um 

129.14 130.71 A: they're raising 'em to fight 

130.34 132.09 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

131.41 133.20 A: and and yet they say well 

133.39 135.62 A: these dogs are safe around my child you know 

136.59 140.36 A: which is why i gave away my last we had a dalmatian my son was a fireman 

140.50 145.51 A: um and so even though he didn't live at home i got a i brought a dalmatian just to be traditional 

145.54 146.37 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

145.76 148.70 A: but dalmatians when they get older um 

148.99 149.87 A: develop 

149.96 152.37 A: i forget if it's hearing or vision problems 

152.42 153.19 B: hm 

152.72 155.38 A: hearing 'cause it goes deaf and they get ugly [noise] 

155.66 161.61 A: and he he trapped on the back porch one day and i said that's it [laughter] he has to go somewhere else so 

161.65 168.02 B: (( [mn] uh to most people to most people they're just property that's why they i don't know they )) 

162.02 163.60 A: (( we found a home for him and yeah oh mm )) 

168.34 172.60 B: there's a [mn] a episode of animal precinct last night where a guy 

173.10 177.88 B: to punish his cat for scratching him he stuck his face in the open flame of an oven 

178.42 179.28 A: [mn] 

179.12 192.50 B: and it oh i i mean of course they took the cat away obviously but i mean they they would have to given the situation but i mean this are horrible i i can't i i love animals i absolutely cannot believe someone would 

192.49 194.65 B: ever ever do that to an animal 

194.72 201.37 A: i i believe [laughter] uh and that's one of the first signs of if if a child is doing something cruel to animals 

201.45 206.40 A: uh they're going to grow up to be a a perverse or uh um uh offender 

207.00 208.74 A: of the larger laws you know 

208.87 212.56 A: rape or or or armed robbery or battery i mean you know major 

213.25 216.92 A: anyway so major psychological defect when you can harm an animal 

216.87 218.25 B: makes sense though 

216.98 220.07 A: (( especially getting joy out of it it's disgusting you know )) 

218.68 220.41 B: yeah 

220.57 231.91 B: yeah my [mn] my sister [noise] when i was younger had a uh wolf hybrid dog that liked to run and it broke every i mean you you could put it on a logging chain and it would break it and run but 

226.06 226.95 A: mhm 

232.01 238.95 B: it actually when it broke loose and ran one time my mom and sister went after it and they found this 

239.30 249.15 B: i don't know ranch or farm or whatever this woman claimed that she lived on but like every i mean they took tons of pictures [noise] all of her animals were in like horrible conditions 

248.27 252.86 A: i know and the people say yes we're protecting them from the life they would have in the wild 

252.99 254.66 A: (( no you don't [laughter] )) 

253.02 267.43 B: but they like it was her private property i mean like she threatened to sue my mom and everything so my mom couldn't do anything about it she went to the police and everything but they couldn't get my t- the law prohibited her from doing anything of it uh anything about it 'cause she was just you know 

257.46 258.42 A: yeah 

267.81 277.97 B: just a civilian and she couldn't and 'cause all the pictures and everything and she had dead animals laying all over the place and she just wasn't taking she 

278.47 280.35 B: wasn't taking care of any of them 

280.32 288.28 A: well i don't i don't know if we're abusing i don't think we're abusing the laws but i'm an officer and i can read the you know the laws myself but we're real [mn] we're fairly quick to animal 

288.36 291.80 A: i think actually we can take an animal away easier than we can take a child 

292.01 294.13 B: really well yeah that would 

293.07 296.29 A: and and get it sent through the court satisfactory 

295.88 298.84 B: that will probably make sense 

299.54 300.67 A: [noise] 

300.13 305.75 B: i don't know i would definitely live on a farm again if i had to so i loved it absolutely loved it 

304.73 305.56 A: (( well but )) 

305.78 310.36 B: 'cause if you if you you can friends you can have people hang out with you always have something to do you 

305.83 307.01 A: (( yeah )) 

310.70 311.56 A: mhm 

310.77 314.91 B: can go out and hang out with the animals and we had 'em in the fair every year 

315.49 321.47 B: like every spring we'd start you know grooming them you know raising them to take to the fair and 

321.85 323.48 B: we had barn school 

323.60 325.09 B: it was so much fun 

325.70 327.48 B: but we had to move 

325.88 326.81 A: (( [mn] you know my )) 

327.17 334.26 A: my daughter in law was raised on a farm in oklahoma and she uh she's always talked about that and my son says i'm a city boy you know you 

333.63 334.73 B: [laughter] it's a 

334.47 340.46 A: your mom lives two miles away go to her farm and [laughter] and come home without smelling like a horse or a cow or something but 

342.06 343.55 B: (( lot of work though )) 

342.07 342.96 A: (( uh pigs )) 

343.89 351.63 A: yeah and and i just it's just not my my thing i'm glad somebody does it tell me about your cockatoos though 'cause i'm more uh you know [noise] 

344.46 345.30 B: (( [mn] )) 

351.29 356.77 B: they're um we had four we had two two breeding pairs but one um 

357.11 362.23 B: one was quite old and he died of old age so now we have the one boy and two girls and the 

362.44 371.98 B: females will absolutely pick on him to death they don't like unless unless they're just in a cage by themselves the male and the female they don't like males being in their cage 

372.13 373.91 B: so he's bald [laughter] 

374.19 377.91 A: interest- sounds a lot like the human race [laughter] 

374.21 375.71 B: (( you should see after they )) 

376.60 383.21 B: they've pulled all his feathers off his head i mean they get along he just never grows his feathers back 'cause apparently they don't 

380.36 380.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

382.26 386.55 A: but do they ever get a chance to to um to run uh no i'm sorry fly 

386.36 387.90 B: to fly um 

388.28 393.94 B: their wings were clipped before but they're anyway they've grown out since then 

394.17 404.58 B: and we let 'em loose every once in a while but not too often 'cause i'm afraid somebody'll you know open the door and 'cause we live in a trailer and our door tends to come open by itself sometimes [laughter] so i'm 

403.95 404.55 A: (( yeah )) 

404.68 407.15 B: afraid one of the birds will take off and fly but 

407.19 412.50 B: i haven't uh gotten to the point of introducing them to the cat yet so i don't know how that's gonna go 

413.03 422.53 B: but he's just he's just a baby so so he won't try anything yet but [noise] it's funny they'll be all quiet and you'll walk through the kitchen and they'll start whistling at you and 

413.16 413.93 A: (( yeah )) 

422.86 428.31 B: my fiance's mother actually taught them to whistle um jingle bells out of tune 

428.52 429.55 A: oh neat 

429.62 430.53 B: (( so )) 

430.11 433.64 A: (( well they were copying her voice i guess she yeah she sings out of )) 

431.44 437.63 B: yeah she's all she's all off key so they're all off key they whistle jingle bells all day long off key it's horrible [laughter] 

437.35 439.61 A: we had a we had a black crow when i was 

439.66 444.19 A: in kindergarten at my grandmother's which was down the street and it could uh

449.53 451.41 B: (( [mn] that'd be interesting to hear )) 

451.39 456.78 A: know it was funny 'cause we we'd go and tickle my sister so it laughs the crow would laugh 

452.84 453.82 B: i want 

456.39 457.98 B: (( [laughter] i've )) 

457.28 457.95 A: (( so ))

464.98 465.88 A: mhm 

465.20 469.25 B: somebody would come to the door and the poodle would start barking and the bird would start barking 

469.31 471.22 B: and you couldn't tell which was which so 

469.35 470.01 A: [mn] 

471.02 472.07 A: yeah 

471.61 476.55 B: they just sounded like a bunch of dogs running round the house barking 'cause the bird would mimic the poodle 

476.70 479.24 B: and then the bird would mimic the vacuum cleaner 

479.46 480.40 A: oh 

479.47 482.53 B: so it would make vacuum cleaner noises 

481.58 485.17 A: hey that's that's better than having a alarm system 

485.35 493.86 B: yeah and my um i don't know where they i i don't remember where they got it from and they don't remember like 

485.81 487.02 A: for the people there 

494.35 505.87 B: [noise] 'cause it came into her mom owned a pet store and it came into the pet store so they don't know who owned it before but the bird will like randomly like at any point in the day for good reason say let's go upstairs ray 

500.39 500.95 A: (( mm )) 

505.99 507.67 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

506.35 513.78 B: so really [laughter] that's what they taught it to say so it still says it probably now and every- like

533.11 541.51 B: where i'm in such a small space and so many people in this area don't take care of their dogs and they let 'em run loose i'm afraid to put a rabbit outside in a hutch 

541.39 542.68 A: right yeah 

542.14 548.78 B: 'cause i'm afraid that they 'cause they don't care like sport around here they don't they don't care whether their dogs don't eat 

549.33 553.38 A: would you raise it for uh just discipline or would you raise it for a pet 

552.61 565.07 B: uh we raise them for pets we raised them for show we operated uh a business and we sold 'em for you know for pet or for show and there were some that we- that we sold for meat of course that wasn't my choice 'cause i was just a kid but
