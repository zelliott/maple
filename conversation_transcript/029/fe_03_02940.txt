108.18 109.33 B: mhm 

108.75 111.35 A: but not too much of that either 

111.41 117.08 A: i don't know the sports the big things the football and baseball and basketball just 

117.49 123.19 A: the amounts of money that the people make just pisses me off [laughter] i guess 

121.48 123.03 B: [laughter] 

123.22 127.08 A: i guess i'm probably a little more interested in 

127.42 131.95 A: but still not interested but more interested in maybe college 

131.87 133.67 B: oh i see i see 

133.07 134.79 A: because you know they're 

135.23 137.96 A: at least they're not getting paid those big bucks 

138.07 139.17 B: i know 

138.43 139.69 A: it just 

140.14 142.19 A: i don't know and to go 

142.23 144.77 A: in person to a game and pay 

145.48 146.38 A: you know 

146.00 147.65 B: that much money 

146.72 150.05 A: fifty or a hundred two hundred dollars to go see a 

150.16 153.19 A: a game or something just seems ridiculous 

152.99 154.10 B: (( i know )) 

154.36 156.40 B: um i rarely go 

154.64 155.84 A: seem like 

156.55 159.71 B: unless my friends are pushing me a lot 

156.77 157.60 A: i 

158.41 161.06 A: hardly ever been before i've 

161.26 167.64 A: i guess i went to a hockey game a few years ago and that was kinda fun but we're supposed to be talking about on television 

167.69 168.60 A: um 

167.71 169.31 B: right 

168.75 174.52 A: i guess i was most interested in in golf watching tiger woods because that was such a 

173.19 174.41 B: right 

174.43 176.94 B: it was amazing like when he 

176.68 177.46 A: [sigh] 

178.03 179.02 B: yeah i 

178.15 181.27 A: how could a kid just just just 

179.63 180.81 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

182.32 185.51 A: pick up and just seem to know the sport 

185.14 186.66 B: (( [noise] right )) 

185.69 187.40 A: and be so natural 

186.99 192.51 B: mhm i i guess it was more of a genius thing than i 

193.27 194.43 B: rather than 

194.71 198.42 B: that i have more interest in golf personally you know 

197.66 200.50 A: mhm mhm right right me too 

199.13 201.63 B: because he plays so well [sigh] 

201.09 208.49 A: right and all you hear on the news is just he's on there all the time until just recently i guess he lost some kind of a 

208.94 210.06 B: right 

208.97 215.88 A: was it the masters or one of those big things that somebody else won it instead of him he came in second i think and 

215.23 216.26 B: right 

215.91 217.18 A: that was kinda 

217.72 221.50 A: i guess everybody can't win all the time but 

219.69 221.83 B: win all the time right 

222.93 226.76 B: [sigh] yeah that's amazing i think so too um 

227.81 229.50 B: [lipsmack] what else 

228.10 230.37 A: and i guess golf has been 

230.92 235.55 A: the i saw something on t._v. about it the other day that they are um 

236.90 238.05 A: (( [lipsmack] giving )) 

238.19 246.06 A: like ten minute lessons or something free to kids all over the united states trying to get them to um 

242.43 243.33 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

243.59 244.98 B: that's nice 

246.38 253.90 A: interested in the sport and somebody was saying what could you learn in ten or twenty minutes or something like that and they said 

248.46 249.52 B: mhm 

254.09 259.42 A: [sigh] you'd be surprised be- and another thing is you can't keep kids' attention that long 

259.05 260.77 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

259.58 261.89 A: but that they could teach 'em something 

261.73 262.89 B: mhm 

262.27 263.86 A: and i guess different 

264.37 273.89 A: clubs and golf courses or something are giving these lessons but i thought about my grandsons but i don't know how to didn't know how to find out 

274.26 275.68 B: oh i see 

274.30 274.95 A: (( so )) 

275.37 278.50 A: where where do you live what state

283.17 283.91 B: (( mm )) 

284.02 285.49 A: quite a ways away 

285.03 289.76 B: right i am a law student so 

288.39 289.97 A: mhm mhm 

290.13 293.67 B: i mean it like every single time there's some 

294.65 300.19 B: basketball or baseball among like college league 

299.81 301.36 A: mhm 

300.67 308.57 B: there's a big um thing going on among us and i'm like hm that's too much [laughter] 

309.27 310.94 B: [sigh] yeah 

310.88 317.26 A: but you know like i have cable t._v. so i have e._s._p._n. but i just never watch it 

316.22 321.15 B: right sometimes my friends come over to watch professional 

321.01 322.29 A: mhm 

321.25 324.05 B: baseball and football 

324.08 329.44 B: but usually i'm just you know having pizza on the side 

329.59 334.67 A: yeah i never have really understood any of them really probably basketball 

329.65 331.17 B: [laughter] at the corner 

334.89 341.39 A: would be the one i'd probably know the most about which isn't much but in that's um 'cause 

341.48 344.03 A: i guess 'cause i'm from indiana 

343.37 344.49 B: oh i see 

344.09 345.32 A: and that's 

346.18 350.08 A: [sigh] really oh man that's really big there 

350.15 351.94 B: right um i 

350.52 351.55 A: and uh 

352.26 357.21 B: i don't think i really like ice hockey it's too violent 

356.76 359.90 A: it does seem to be pretty violent but it um 

358.49 359.38 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

359.92 367.87 B: to me if there's more like violence 'cause they get mad and they beat up each other rather than playing the sport 

367.24 372.51 A: mhm mhm but things like i don't [mn] i just don't understand 

373.64 377.86 A: football it doesn't make any sense to me 

374.73 375.87 B: the rules 

378.42 382.85 B: i sometimes root for patriots because i'm from boston 

382.56 384.05 A: mhm mhm 

383.67 384.66 B: but 

384.74 391.50 B: [laughter] other than that like i have very little interest in sports in general 

392.38 398.05 A: i wasn't even sure when they called me if i was going to even try this call because 

392.74 393.71 B: (( because )) 

397.26 398.55 B: mhm 

398.30 408.19 A: when it came up the topic of sports but the last time i've done one of these once before and it said the topic after you got on it seemed like and they gave us 

408.75 410.63 A: three or four choices 

410.40 411.90 B: oh i see 

411.44 412.48 A: and i thought 

412.75 420.55 A: i didn't know why so when it said sports on t._v. i thought well maybe there'd be some more suggestions of what to talk about 

419.98 421.42 B: (( [noise] right )) 

420.85 422.17 A: this is kinda 

422.32 428.42 A: this is very strange program thing but i thought i'd try a couple of times and see what happens 

425.40 426.79 B: [laughter] 

427.96 429.05 B: right 

428.91 431.07 A: (( i don't really understand )) 

431.91 435.90 A: what it is i signed up for except it's kinda interesting 

433.84 434.89 B: uh-huh 

436.39 437.35 B: i guess 

436.57 442.60 A: talking to people i talked to the other lady i talked to also another woman was um from uh 

442.70 443.87 A: new york 

443.74 445.04 B: oh i see 

445.19 446.33 A: (( and uh )) 

446.73 449.44 B: um actually this is my first time 

449.28 451.81 A: is it yeah this is my second so 

452.31 453.25 B: (( i see [sigh] ))

461.29 462.87 B: on tv 

466.43 469.94 A: i don't know the the other thing about it is 

470.14 472.91 A: not just the sports i guess it must be 

473.17 479.44 A: must be an awful lot of people that watch it even though we're not two of the ones that do because of the the 

478.00 479.30 B: (( right [noise] )) 

479.84 484.54 A: advertisements that how costly they are 

482.61 486.57 B: right like if if you watch superbowl like 

486.35 488.21 A: oh my god 

486.92 489.35 B: there's so much commercial

504.44 505.76 B: mhm 

505.18 506.97 A: a little bit but 

506.61 517.71 B: i think it's an annual thing if i watch superbowl because it's just you know once in a year and you know people get together and have food and 

517.47 523.26 A: right but i wouldn't turn that on by myself just sitting here in my house i don't think

557.31 558.40 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

560.30 565.13 A: that they went over the topics and there were like i said i think there were four topics 

565.60 574.74 A: and they went over them so fast and just once and you couldn't like push a button to replay the topics you just had to start talking 

573.20 574.60 B: oh i see 

574.78 577.59 A: and that was what i left for a co- for a comment
