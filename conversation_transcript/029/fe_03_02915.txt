198.67 199.61 A: did it 

199.43 201.54 B: yeah it was kind of uh 

202.25 203.70 B: (( i don't know it was kind of slow )) 

202.34 203.10 A: oh 

203.82 204.52 A: oh 

204.82 206.94 A: so what do you think about the war that's going on 

207.47 212.81 B: um i'm kind of a little embarrassed to say this i have no idea [laughter] right 

212.40 213.54 A: (( [mn] don't )) 

212.91 219.14 B: i don't pay attention yeah it's really depressing i like tried to follow it for a little bit and i just got frustrated so i just kind of 

218.53 219.43 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

219.31 229.24 B: nah but my brother just went into the army and so i guess i should pay more attention to it isn't the war over now though didn't they like accomplish they threw out saddam and 

225.62 226.86 A: yeah 

228.94 231.79 A: yeah they just haven't been able to find saddam yet 

232.19 233.35 B: yeah 

232.74 239.04 A: but they haven't found him but they just dug up what over thirty bodies in shallow graves people that were just executed 

239.07 241.06 B: oh really that's awful 

239.54 243.71 A: over there yeah yeah lot of controversy about why we're over there 

243.91 245.33 B: yeah i know 

243.96 245.80 A: you know why our people are over there 

245.96 247.42 B: (( oh yeah )) 

246.01 248.17 A: well they're over there to protect us 

248.29 250.06 B: yeah definitely 

248.37 250.85 A: that's basically what it comes down to you know 

251.44 261.20 B: i don't know i just feel kind of bad i'm always like against going into like you know someone else's house and telling them how to clean it you know even if they're not doing it the right way it's just kind of like you know 

257.42 258.50 A: right 

259.22 260.32 A: yeah 

261.66 268.72 A: oh it i guess in some similarities it's the same way but in others it's not when we're talking about mass destruction and what 

268.78 271.11 A: they could do to our country 

271.23 273.40 A: you know when you've got saddam hussein 

271.38 272.48 B: that's true 

273.55 277.09 A: and the power that he did have over all it feels like another hitler 

277.68 284.81 A: you know and uh with the amounts of mass destruction that he did say that he did have could have harmed people here 

284.90 290.44 A: so i think by us going there to um shake him down and get him out of office 

290.60 298.54 A: and rebuild will will be much better for that country i think it's awesome that we did that for for that country that's helping 

298.69 301.41 A: isn't that what we're all supposed to be doing is helping each other 

301.43 303.16 B: yeah hm 

302.02 302.94 A: you know 

303.08 306.73 A: let them have a real life now over there freedom too 

307.25 309.08 A: see they didn't have that before 

309.56 311.10 A: not like we have 

311.27 316.00 B: i don't know did they ever take a a poll of the majority of the people to see how they felt 

311.31 313.02 A: it'll take time to rebuild 

315.99 321.27 A: i have actually i have and every person i've talked to through this survey 

321.67 325.24 A: has has felt very similar the way i have felt 

325.12 326.25 B: oh really 

325.71 336.66 A: yep and it's so ironic because i've watched so many television news shows about all the people that are protesting against this war and i've yet to talk to one person that's protested it against it 

336.30 340.04 B: i actually protested just because i'm like very anti war [laughter] i'm like 

339.70 342.24 A: well i'm anti war too please don't get me wrong 

341.96 351.63 B: yeah i know i think it's more like i'm at college forever you know like there's a war and all those people protest [laughter] like you know it's kind of in the spirit of college but um 

342.72 343.73 A: but 

350.40 358.15 A: yeah but do do but do the and i'm not saying that you don't know what you're fighting for but you said you just had a brother that went into the service 

357.78 366.93 B: yeah he went into the service yeah our mother is upset um well he's a a helicopter he was training to be a a helicopter pilot 

359.30 361.04 A: okay what branch did he go 

366.88 367.78 A: okay 

367.50 370.96 B: and our mother is like hysterical she's beside herself so 

370.94 379.46 A: right and i can understand that i can i've got a teenage son who is going to be uh signing up to go to uh into the service at the end of this summer sure and i've got 

377.14 378.36 B: oh really 

378.42 379.41 B: wow 

379.48 385.66 A: had two brothers over there older brothers forty nine and fifty years old that were over there they left their families to well they had to go 

385.78 398.44 A: but that's what they went in for you know to protect us and to protect our country and i guess when you have somebody that's been in the service for so long you really have a better understanding as to why they go they don't go for choice to go kill people 

398.70 401.94 A: but if your life is in danger wouldn't your brother try to protect you 

401.90 403.89 B: oh yeah most definitely 

403.14 411.79 A: well that's and that in the same fashion that's what our men and women are doing they're trying to protect us from the osama bin laden's and the saddam hussein's 

411.94 412.89 A: you know 

412.20 422.22 B: see i i agree with that but my whole problem is is that i really don't like bush and i really feel that like if regardless of what was going on that he would have picked a war with someone that's just how i feel 

422.06 436.42 B: so it's i like i guess i have kind of a jaded outlook on it 'cause i feel like he just wanted something you know that maybe he might have created i'm not to say that you know saddam i mean saddam has been like a reoccurring problem but i just feel like he wanted to finish like what daddy didn't or what daddy started 

436.23 437.25 A: right 

436.24 444.08 B: you know with the gulf war that's just why i'm like a little less like for it because i really don't like him [laughter] like i really don't like him 

443.76 450.06 A: sure and and there's a lot of people that don't like bush but there's a lot of presidents that we've had in the past that didn't have the balls enough to do something either 

450.27 452.65 B: well that's true too yes it's 

451.37 452.31 A: you know 

452.55 457.81 A: you got to have balls to run this country you got to have balls i mean i hate to use that term but 

458.10 461.66 A: you know uh if i felt somebody was threatening my family 

461.77 466.68 A: boy i'd be the first one right there with my nine millimeter protecting my family you know 

464.82 465.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

466.75 477.32 A: and i have family i had family that was in the world trade center they got out but i'm just as angry as as everybody else is that didn't really or have someone has had somebody that died in that world trade center 

477.59 487.09 A: you know so [mn] it kind of hits close to home when you've got a loved one [lipsmack] that came that close to death because of somebody else's stupidity and their money and their power 

483.61 484.66 B: yeah 

487.27 490.97 A: so our president what was he to do just sit back 

491.34 493.19 A: screw it just just you know 

491.65 506.46 B: well just to play devil's just to play devil's advocate just that i'd be curious as to what you think what do you think about like this whole thing in in us going into like you know israel and palestine and just trying to like put our foot down them you know it i feel like it's all somewhat tied in you know 

506.25 514.26 A: well somebody has to do it and they don't have enough enough good people in their country to do those things for them 

506.36 507.09 B: like 

514.61 522.66 A: why not whether it be bush or be clinton or be the next president somebody's going to have to do it this war has got to the wars have to stop 

523.29 530.21 A: everybody argues about the stupidest things i'm not going to ask you about your religion because that's your business 

525.99 527.76 B: it's true it's really true 

530.25 535.35 A: right and what you believe is is how you feel that's that's good for you 

530.96 532.10 B: mhm 

535.41 544.65 A: i'm i'm glad for you and if that's the way you want to live your life fantastic i am not going to sit here and be judgmental and tell you you have to believe what i believe like these other 

544.71 547.04 A: powerful people think that they are like 

547.21 548.28 B: that's true 

547.32 560.10 A: you know over at israel and [laughter] in iraq and all those places look at africa starving people we can't even take care of our own people but what is this country doing we're sending aid to those people to try to help them rebuild 

561.01 564.57 A: you know that's what life is all about is helping people 

564.58 570.23 A: so yes innocent people do get killed innocent people get killed on the highway by a drunk driver 

570.50 571.36 B: right 

570.53 573.61 A: do you see people going out protesting the drunk drivers 

574.58 580.02 A: sure you've got m._a._d._d. and you've got uh the artists against drunk drivers but it's never going to stop 

578.55 579.54 B: mhm 

580.24 586.58 A: it's never going to stop that's like the people over in the f- n- in japan or china you're only allowed to have one or two children 

586.62 588.77 A: you have three you have to have an abortion 

589.35 590.74 A: communist countries 

591.17 597.22 A: is that the kind of country do you want to live in where you erase the freedom of speech and everything else in this country 

597.33 599.67 A: hell no i wouldn't want to live like that 

599.33 599.89 B: right
