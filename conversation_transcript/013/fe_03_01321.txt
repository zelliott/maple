0.14 1.86 B: bayliss lee 

1.53 3.24 A: uh pat greg 

5.07 17.80 A: and no i don't i think publicly owned places can ban smoking certainly but i don't think privately owned public places uh the government should make that decision for them 

18.00 19.24 B: i agree 

19.20 24.38 A: (( [laughter] we don't have a lot to talk about do we [laughter] are you a smoker )) 

19.87 21.10 B: [laughter] 

21.53 26.02 B: [laughter] no my husband is though 

25.73 27.56 A: are you a former smoker 

27.15 28.03 B: no 

27.93 30.04 A: oh okay i'm a former smoker 

29.49 30.59 B: you are you 

30.33 35.79 A: yes and it's been a number of years and i quit cold turkey and i'll never do it again 

35.47 37.17 B: well that's great 

37.11 38.41 A: uh however 

38.49 41.97 A: i do think those people that want to have the right to do it if they choose to 

41.48 42.70 B: i do too 

42.90 46.98 B: but then i think too that you know um i had a um 

47.10 50.93 B: friend who um got lung cancer from secondhand smoke 

51.14 53.28 A: and never smoked a day in in 

52.40 55.57 B: and never smoked mhm 

54.06 56.34 A: yeah so i mean how do you 

56.42 59.48 A: how do people rationalize that 

59.20 64.35 B: i don't know because you know you think it's so unfair but 

64.37 69.09 B: then again i think everybody from the first amendment have their rights you know 

68.93 69.84 A: yes 

69.11 72.24 B: um now we can definitely because you know 

72.24 86.46 B: y- years and years ago people could smoke at their desk because we had you know 'cause i remember in the workplace they could smoke at their desk if they had ashtrays you know they they weren't didn't have to go outside or go into a restricted area just to smoke 

75.99 76.93 A: yes 

81.47 82.35 A: yes 

83.67 84.63 A: right 

86.42 93.20 B: only until i think the legislature and people got behind it that you know did they actually start to 

93.65 102.90 B: make you know rules for and i i sometimes feel sorry for the smokers in the wintertime having to have to go outside to smoke [laughter] or in the rain [laughter] 

102.23 103.46 A: yeah 

102.92 109.62 B: you know because if that's the choice you know i think they should have at least an area for them you like at the airport 

109.65 115.94 B: um my husband and i was going through the airport in atlanta and they have a designated room now [mn] 

109.72 110.71 A: yes 

114.34 115.35 A: mhm 

116.00 128.24 B: of course the ventilation was absolutely horrible in there 'cause i walked in there but i couldn't take it too much so i just had to leave him in that room and get and get out because it just was too bad 

120.08 120.89 A: (( [laughter] )) 

122.48 123.34 A: yeah 

125.85 126.83 A: (( yeah )) 

127.49 128.29 A: yes 

128.62 132.15 A: i don't i don't allow anyone to smoke in my house or my car 

132.11 138.25 B: right now i don't like 'em smoking in my car but in my house i i i don't really um 

132.32 133.27 A: and it's 

138.40 147.57 B: push the issue if they smoke because my husband smokes and he pays the mortgage and he told me that if he paid the mortgage he was gonna smoke [laughter] in his house i said 

145.37 159.59 A: well but i mean you live with him and you knew that he was so you know you kind of have to pay the price but i mean if i choose to go to if if a restaurant makes its own decision that they want to be a non smoking restaurant 

148.26 150.82 B: yeah yeah that's different mhm 

154.63 155.47 B: uh-huh 

159.25 160.29 B: right 

159.66 162.82 A: uh there are certainly a ton of us that are gonna go there 

162.49 163.50 B: right 

163.02 166.25 A: if the food's horrid i'm not gonna go there regardless 

165.71 167.76 B: that's exactly right you know 

167.37 168.37 A: um 

167.98 170.23 B: whether people smoke or not [mn] you know 

169.43 171.30 A: whether people smoke or not 

170.59 172.85 B: mhm i agree 

172.70 175.21 A: so i don't feel i don't know 

175.23 178.51 A: my sister is the only one left in our family that smokes 

178.01 182.68 B: i'm trying to get my husband to stop so badly because he he's he's um 

183.48 190.30 B: he's overweight not overweight overweight you know but overweight for our our age now you know um 

190.81 203.14 B: well i guess you'd say he he's about six six one but he weighs about two thirty like that's not too bad but but it i guess we were so much smaller twenty years ago [laughter] when we got married 

196.10 197.09 A: mhm 

201.22 202.87 A: [laughter] 

203.17 207.03 B: and i guess it's just that um he's been smoking the whole time 

207.62 210.66 B: so i wish that he would you know stop 

210.28 213.30 A: stop does he does money impress him 

213.41 214.40 B: i beg your pardon 

213.94 216.84 A: d- does money does the money issue get to him 

216.97 218.80 B: um no mhm 

217.45 224.18 A: because that's one of the things that i say to people is you know if you smoke three packs of cigarettes a week 

224.14 232.83 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] okay it's uh yeah because they're like three ninety nine a pack 

224.30 226.99 A: that is like ten dollars 

232.17 241.14 A: yeah so if you're talking like eleven dollars a week times fifty two i mean that's five hundred and seventy two dollars you can take a vacation 

233.02 235.01 B: and 

237.94 238.88 B: mhm 

241.01 245.83 B: yeah you could really could and i think he probably 

242.38 244.06 A: for that [laughter] 

246.96 251.15 B: um maybe cl- if he's not a pack a day he's close to a pack a day 

251.25 252.39 A: yeah 

251.95 261.02 B: you know and uh and like i said and high blood pressure run in his family and you know those kinds of things and he drinks and you know those kinds of things i wished he 

253.36 255.29 A: i think i did that wrong 

261.10 264.59 B: you know because of all of that i wish he would stop smoking 

264.68 274.56 A: okay he's i did that i did that calculation incorrectly if you smoke a pack a day and it costs four dollars for a pack it's about it's almost fifteen hundred dollars a year 

271.23 272.02 B: mhm 

274.31 275.49 B: (( oh okay )) 

275.29 277.83 A: that's a lot that's almost an i._r._a. 

277.37 279.62 B: it is it really is 

279.73 284.13 A: you know and it that exponentially is gonna increase in value [laughter] 

283.21 286.57 B: uh it sure is and it just keep going up and up and up 

286.69 288.44 A: that's a lot of money 

288.00 290.68 B: it sure is a lot 

288.98 292.17 A: so yeah i'm too cheap i wouldn't be able to do that [laughter] 

291.37 295.03 B: i know but he he has he has no problem about that 

294.72 296.10 A: yeah huh 

296.03 301.05 B: he has no problem with paying that yes mhm 

298.04 299.60 A: so do you work

327.92 328.87 B: (( yeah ))

338.85 339.55 A: (( oh )) 

339.64 341.62 A: okay never heard of it 

340.71 343.82 B: and my husband happen to have the t._v. always has it so loud 

343.92 349.35 A: oh is he has he does smoking affect his hearing [laughter] 

347.20 354.91 B: no he just for some reason it's because he got that um that bowls entertainment center you know in the in the house and so 

352.35 353.98 A: oh yeah 

354.69 364.04 B: he likes to be in like he's in a theater or something [laughter] right that's it surround sound that's it i'm going like 

357.57 359.27 A: surround sound 

359.50 361.22 A: surround sound 

362.65 368.68 A: well do you go i used to bowl and i would come home and wash everything 

368.99 374.48 A: i mean i wouldn't even wear a coat in because i knew i was gonna come home smelling like cigarette smoke 

374.11 375.26 B: oh really 

374.64 379.50 A: and um and i'm not so sure that's where i didn't really get asthma 

379.64 382.76 A: or that it wasn't complicated by that then 

379.68 380.77 B: oh okay 

381.36 383.18 B: mhm 

382.95 383.97 A: um 

384.48 389.20 A: but it's uh anybody that knows me knows that uh they cannot smoke in my house or my car 

388.87 389.82 B: right 

389.30 394.59 A: but if they wanna go someplace with me and they smoke i'm happy to stop as many times as i need to 

391.92 392.76 B: mhm 

394.44 395.31 B: okay 

395.34 396.29 B: yeah 

395.45 398.45 A: but that means that means we need to leave an hour earlier 

398.18 399.35 B: right 

398.68 402.11 A: so if we need to be there by eight in the morning we have to leave at seven 

401.69 403.86 B: oh okay i see i see 

403.03 407.06 A: so and and i think that's fair for me 

406.62 407.96 B: it is 

407.32 410.69 A: it is and i would rather drive because if we go in their car then 

409.79 412.31 B: car then you can't you don't have a choice if 

411.63 413.87 A: i don't have a choice yeah 

412.34 414.77 B: right now some people 

414.91 417.10 B: like my girlfriend um 

417.03 422.55 B: my husband smokes and she doesn't and she and she doesn't allow it in her house so he smokes out on the patio when we go visit her 

422.10 423.08 A: mhm 

422.40 426.53 B: but if she's in our car he's gonna smoke and she's gonna fuss 

426.31 438.53 B: and [laughter] that's gonna be a back and forth thing you know and so if we go in hers then he can't smoke and so he'd rather go in his and he said he'll never go any more without his car [laughter] you know so 

429.38 430.40 A: yeah 

437.89 440.45 A: well and i can understand his point 

440.14 441.56 B: yeah 

440.89 444.91 A: but you know i don't understand people's point in airplanes 

444.95 448.88 A: because people the people who don't smoke don't have any place to go 

446.18 447.59 B: oh yeah 

448.32 453.04 B: no they don't and you remember when airplanes did have that you know airplanes um 

453.49 460.57 B: you know they they uh at one time it was in the back of in the back of the plane was uh the smoking area 

455.34 456.99 A: had smoking areas 

459.95 466.18 A: right but all it i mean even then i said you know all we're doing is recirculating the same air how can this be 

464.53 466.16 B: right 

466.37 468.77 B: that's exactly right 

467.34 470.88 A: this is uh this is not a viable thing we're doing here 

470.82 471.86 B: no 

471.69 486.53 B: uh-uh but so they just stopped all of the stopped all of that smoking so really it doesn't bother me now my husband and i take a flight [sigh] you better believe he can't wait till he gets off that plane [laughter] and goes to that that little room [laughter] to suck a cigarette 

480.63 482.18 A: [laughter] 

482.86 484.49 A: [laughter] 

486.56 487.74 A: well 

486.85 488.66 B: i guess it's addictive though 

488.62 492.74 A: it is very addictive it's very a- and i always thought that [noise] i was 

493.13 496.41 A: more addicted because i not only smoked but i smoked menthol 

496.18 498.12 B: right yeah he smokes menthols too 

497.74 500.38 A: but i never smoked till i got to my office 

500.26 501.26 B: (( oh okay )) 

500.93 502.34 A: now my sister 

502.45 504.41 A: when her feet hit the floor 

503.08 508.56 B: mhm w- oh okay well if 

504.68 507.11 A: in the morning she's got a cigarette 

507.79 512.04 A: so i think she's i think there's an addictive level that i have no knowledge of 

511.46 517.36 B: oh okay because believe me the first thing in the morning he picks up his cigarettes [laughter] 

517.09 519.92 A: yeah i just think that there's something 

519.94 522.19 A: something happened there that is 

522.47 524.78 A: so much more addictive than what i knew 

524.55 525.71 B: right 

525.83 530.90 A: and i wish i wish somebody could come up with i mean i know my sister wants to quit 

530.55 531.48 B: yeah 

531.01 532.55 A: but i also know that 

531.49 545.53 B: and i know my husband does too but he just he does not have the willpower or the stamina to stop and believe me my h- my daughter has been she's been trying to get her dad to quit smoking we only have one child and [laughter] he tried 

545.65 554.81 B: and believe me before the week was out we wanted to go buy him a carton of cigarettes ourselves god he was a 

551.65 554.03 A: [laughter] he 

554.95 565.90 B: bear i thought i told her i said kalanza i said let's just go get him a pack of cigarettes because we're gonna kill him [laughter] he is going to be dead 

565.65 569.80 A: needs to like go in the go in the service or something and be away for six months 

569.67 570.74 B: yeah 

570.08 571.65 A: and quit while he's gone 

571.52 575.57 B: yeah ain't that the truth i mean he was a 

575.58 585.86 B: bear i was like oh if cigarette smoking make you act like this then you just don't need to give it up you just need to go on and smoke because you're about to drive us crazy [laughter] 

581.83 583.15 A: [laughter] 

583.61 586.82 A: [laughter] is this your first call like this 

586.46 587.51 B: yes 

587.30 592.05 A: okay it is mine too so i have i have no expectation as to what's going to happen 

588.60 589.64 B: is it 

591.77 599.55 B: oh i don't either i just did it for a survey part i was like you know and plus i like to talk anyway so no big deal [laughter] and my 

595.45 596.34 A: yeah 

597.52 599.89 A: [laughter] well i i didn't know whether you
