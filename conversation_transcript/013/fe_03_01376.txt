1.30 3.43 A: hello my name is tara 

3.11 7.31 B: hi tara [lipsmack] so we're talking about um 

7.62 11.18 B: oh if schools should be able to 

12.03 14.29 B: uh censor what our kids read 

14.01 15.23 A: right 

14.62 16.16 B: i think so 

16.46 21.64 B: i uh i recall when my daughter was my daughter was in about um 

22.46 27.24 B: oh third grade maybe and she went to a public school at that time 

27.40 32.18 B: and they were reading a book about uh i think it was a farm dog 

32.29 43.68 B: and s- s- certain things she brought the book home and and certain things in that book uh the farm dog would kill the chickens however like some of the words would be like um 

44.37 48.36 B: murder bloody murder this is how the dog would talk you know 

48.48 57.67 B: and killing those those types of words and i actually went to the school and told them what are they doing letting little third graders read this stuff you know 

51.53 52.66 A: mhm 

57.82 64.13 B: in in in this neighborhood there's enough little kids that are on their own with with crime and whatnot that 

64.03 75.05 B: they don't need to be reading it in school you know even though it was just a dog and a chicken but just the the words i don't know i think schools should uh censor what the kids read 

69.54 70.58 A: mhm 

73.59 75.80 A: oh i do too definitely 

75.95 84.81 A: and i think not you know all the way up all through high school sometimes some of the stuff i have children in a private catholic school and 

79.53 80.97 B: yeah 

83.65 85.45 B: mhm 

85.03 90.49 A: they read books with dirty words in 'em [laughter] and i'm paying for a catholic education 

87.21 88.86 B: is that right 

89.88 98.02 B: well y- i sent my daughter to catholic school up until this year and i i don't think that i ever found anything like that um 

96.82 102.12 A: you know and and this point the point of the one book they were reading was 

102.20 105.73 A: they were trying to make it look bad you know they they were trying to 

104.32 106.06 B: mhm 

106.10 110.97 A: decimate that character but i don't know i think they should and i think public schools too 

111.22 113.76 A: um private schools probably get by with 

114.50 121.48 A: um things in different ways than public schools you know it's re- like regulated on a individual basis you know each school but 

119.78 120.74 B: (( uh huh )) 

121.51 124.83 A: um i don't think they do enough of that sometimes 

124.73 126.66 B: yeah 

125.00 134.21 A: you know or a photograph saying even those national geographic there's been questions about that you know just because the photographs in the magazines it's educational 

129.97 131.00 B: (( uh huh )) 

132.14 134.71 B: (( right uh huh )) 

134.42 139.76 A: and you learn about the natives but you know what adolescent girls and boys are doing you know so 

139.08 140.43 B: right right 

140.13 143.44 A: they look at things differently than you and i do [laughter] you know 

142.00 148.31 B: yeah i remember the first time i saw a national geo- geographic when i was young you know and i was shocked you know 

144.71 145.52 A: (( me too )) 

146.07 146.97 A: me too 

147.92 153.56 A: me too i remember boys taking it and going into the little reading area and laughing 

153.46 155.50 B: (( uh huh right right )) 

153.67 158.82 A: you know and and that's part of growing up but i don't want my kids exposed to that at school 

156.01 157.12 B: (( yeah )) 

158.53 163.37 B: well no uh uh not uh unless i say it's okay 

163.26 164.84 A: right right 

163.77 172.16 B: yeah you know ask me if it's okay for instance when i was in school um health class we learned sex education 

172.18 178.28 B: and um at that time i don't recall that any note was sent home to the parents or whatnot 

177.32 179.22 A: right they probably didn't no 

179.07 188.47 B: you know and i'm i'm forty and uh i think these days it's uh i think they they do um 

180.78 181.99 A: yeah me too 

187.59 190.69 A: yeah they our school does where my kids are 

189.16 191.26 B: mhm mhm mhm 

190.96 194.10 A: and um you know i know there's certain things they 

194.16 207.52 A: they won't like some articles and things they won't allow it they talk about sexual rituals in other countries and things like that they they don't expose kids to stuff like that but i think whatever our kids are seeing if it's not normal 

201.11 202.14 B: oh 

207.57 210.33 A: conversation or it's not something we would 

210.35 213.75 A: um not have a problem with they should pass it by us first 

213.59 220.45 B: i think so too now my daughter is learning in health about anorexia and um and the other one uh bulimia 

219.77 221.28 A: (( bulimia mhm )) 

221.23 230.17 B: and i i almost think that they should've asked me if it's okay that that that is you know a topic i'd approve of because in a way i don't 

230.06 231.09 A: mhm 

230.16 237.98 B: because she's learning something she never knew about you know and um sometimes i think that it teaches the kids how to do certain things 

232.38 233.38 A: right 

237.32 239.50 A: oh i do too i do too 

239.20 240.16 B: you know 

240.25 241.47 B: and uh 

240.39 246.87 A: and different kids would react different ways too i don't know i think you should always know when it's anything 

245.03 246.36 B: yeah 

247.54 249.87 A: that's just my personal opinion 

247.60 252.09 B: that's yeah yeah i'm hoping you know now let's see she's in 

252.17 264.11 B: uh sixth grade and i'm hoping you know when their i don't know when their their sex education starts but first of all the health teacher is this old guy and i don't think she'd feel comfortable learning from him anyway 

263.29 264.52 A: mhm 

264.11 272.27 B: but uh give me a choice because actually i'd rather uh inform her of that i'd prefer to do that myself 

269.17 270.22 A: mhm 

271.24 284.91 A: yeah i prefer that with the sex education too but it's a mandatory program within the where i'm in st louis in the catholic archdiocese here and it's a good program but i just think i'd rather my kids learn it from me 

273.65 275.30 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

284.66 285.59 B: (( uh huh )) 

284.93 294.25 A: than from some you know sixty year old gravelly voiced woman or man [laughter] you know like oh that's a good ex- their first experience [laughter] hearing about this you know 

288.61 291.65 B: right yeah 

292.64 293.53 B: right 

293.76 295.32 B: yeah 

294.59 309.12 A: but um and by choice i tend- i tended to go over those particular sections at home first so that it came from me first but even you know anything if there's something that's gonna come up in a novel or something they're reading for literature 

302.80 303.74 B: mhm 

309.01 319.99 A: if we know first we can even put it into a different context at home or well you know this is how some people are but this is how we're trying to raise you and you know so that 

312.82 315.00 B: right mhm 

320.46 323.73 A: you know they're gonna figure out that stuff's all out there but 

323.05 324.42 B: yeah 

323.80 327.03 A: i would like my influence being the first influence 

326.54 340.79 B: yeah i haven't uh discussed that in t- uh in detail with my daughter [laughter] yet uh but my son is is almost nineteen you know and and i have with him when he was like seven for some reason it just seems harder with my daughter 

332.15 333.50 A: mhm 

340.53 341.63 A: mhm 

340.89 353.31 B: um but uh my daughter uh her little friend they ha- she has a boyfriend you know the not my daughter but her little friend and the boyfriend and the girlfriend were holding hands at school 

353.58 358.09 B: and the principal said you know what is this uh what are you doing holding hands in school you know 

358.35 367.47 B: and so if they're gonna be that um aware of what the kids are doing i do hope that they are going to be conscious about 

367.71 374.84 B: what they're reading you know when the time comes you know i never did get that book um 

369.29 370.45 A: right 

371.36 372.78 A: mhm 

374.89 389.06 B: uh when she was in third grade taken out of the school or off the library shelves um you know i had a meeting with the the principal and and sent emails to the school board and whatnot and everybody just blows it off like it's no big deal 

378.63 379.70 A: mhm 

388.26 389.37 A: i know 

389.09 402.14 B: and you know with with the the young kids that are home with a single mom and i'm a single mom but but i work to where i can always be with my kids but a lot of mothers don't so these kids come home from school by themselves 

397.65 398.49 A: mhm 

401.98 407.42 B: uh come home and they're exposed to that element out there and plus their reading 

407.26 417.13 B: murder bloody murder regardless if it's coming from a dog who killed a chicken you know and and talking about the blood everywhere i mean that's just not necessary there's so many other things that they can 

408.53 409.91 A: mhm 

417.47 418.47 A: right 

417.51 419.79 B: read about you know 

418.72 419.81 A: yeah i 

419.84 424.80 B: read about the there was a kid who who helped the the hungry man or something you know 

424.27 425.74 A: mhm 

425.12 426.64 B: but um 

427.25 441.16 B: i don't know i'm i'm surprised i got this call though [laughter] 'cause i haven't had one in a long time and i was just uh reading on that uh on one of the the bulletin boards about this and and everybody was saying oh did you get another call yet i 

431.05 432.27 A: yeah 

441.31 442.66 B: i i didn't get one 

442.01 444.52 A: yeah this is only my second one too 

444.08 445.61 B: yeah mine too 

445.28 451.15 A: and it's been quite a while for me too and my last one believe it or not was on education also 

447.25 448.28 B: yes 

450.60 451.68 B: oh
