2.22 4.33 B: hi leeann my name's stephen 

4.18 5.22 A: hi 

4.88 5.89 B: how are you 

5.61 16.05 A: i'm doing pretty good that's actually my brother's name [laughter] very odd um topic is minimum wage what did he say it was five fifteen five twenty five 

6.66 7.76 B: [laughter] 

8.50 10.02 B: oh easy to remember 

12.90 13.73 B: right 

15.58 18.52 B: i guess it's going up to that yeah 

17.96 21.39 A: i don't think that's enough not for people who are trying to live on it 

20.96 23.13 B: no i i totally agree 

22.70 32.40 A: yeah i mean for the teenager that's out there just making spare money you know on the weekends that's plenty but uh i remember when i was making that wage in college and it wasn't enough to even pay for the books you know 

32.24 35.11 B: right but then on the other hand i mean 

33.13 34.00 A: so 

35.65 41.44 B: if it goes a lot higher to where someone can support themselves a lot of the businesses can't afford it 

40.97 43.88 A: exactly exactly it's kinda one of those 

42.04 44.45 B: so it's kind of a catch twenty two 

43.99 52.57 A: double edged swords there [laughter] brings all the prices up higher for everybody else so we can't afford anything either [laughter] it's 

45.70 47.01 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

51.38 52.77 B: right 

52.83 60.75 A: one of those hard areas of life where you just say well i guess you gotta go back to college now [laughter] i mean you know it's a terrible 

57.87 59.84 B: [laughter] 

59.99 62.37 B: it's true that's true though 

60.98 66.86 A: it's terribly true that you have to go to college now to be the manager of a blockbuster for the rest of your life you know it's 

65.68 66.83 B: (( right )) 

66.80 77.64 A: it's really sick but you know unfortunately that's the way it is so i would think going up to five fifteen hm i thought it was already higher in this state i guess i'm really out of touch [laughter] 

75.71 76.90 B: yeah so 

77.44 81.41 B: yeah i thought it was yeah i thought it was like closer to six for some reason 

79.29 83.42 A: six something yeah i did too i d- maybe it's the minimum 

83.57 86.67 A: maybe it's what they're considering the minimum uh [sigh] 

86.97 96.40 A: you know minimum requirement for and then the the states can have their own i guess i don't know i think it's higher here i really do i think it's six something 

92.05 92.93 B: (( right right )) 

96.29 97.80 B: what state is that 

97.57 98.49 A: oregon 

98.37 99.78 B: oh 

99.23 103.93 A: i think it's just over six dollars here but you know like i said i might be out of touch too i haven't 

103.11 106.20 B: oh really different states have different minimum wages huh 

106.03 108.42 A: oh i think they do yeah 

107.22 108.87 B: oh i didn't know that 

108.47 118.19 A: yeah i think they do you know see how out of touch i am i have no clue [laughter] just glad not to be making minimum wage personally [laughter] 

111.52 112.82 B: [laughter] 

115.70 117.30 B: [laughter] 

117.72 118.99 B: right

120.40 124.46 B: [laughter] yeah some people don't even have that these days 

123.94 133.15 A: well he was teetering he was teetering his current company was going out of business and so he had a six months looking for a job before he found you know something but uh 

132.33 134.41 B: mm oh that's scary huh 

133.73 136.77 A: yeah it is [laughter] 

136.57 150.51 A: [noise] but anyway [noise] ten minutes to talk about minimum wage [laughter] i think mostly they're just looking at our linguistics patterns anyway or something like that i don't well it said it's a language study 

139.76 143.29 B: [laughter] it's rou- that's rough huh 

146.86 148.58 B: oh really [laughter] 

150.35 157.21 A: i do- so i don't know how how much they're really listening to our topic they just wanna give us something to talk about [laughter] 

156.12 159.50 B: they just throw two strangers in the mix and see what happens huh 

158.49 162.60 A: there you go there you go and they say hm what'll happen 

160.58 162.04 B: kinda weird [laughter] 

162.74 165.77 A: so i'm in oregon where did you s- did you say where you were 

164.39 167.72 B: um no i i'm in california 

167.12 174.06 A: oh well not too far away somewhere i've actually been in this country [laughter] i haven't been too far so 

171.20 172.77 B: [laughter] yeah 

173.38 175.31 B: yeah i've been up to oregon too 

175.02 177.45 A: yeah yeah 

176.16 179.70 B: it's nice up there except it it seems to rain every time i go up there 

179.21 189.74 A: well that's because it pretty much always rains here it's raining right now it's there's like you know two weeks total during the whole summer where it doesn't rain no i'm just kidding it's more like four but you know [laughter] 

180.85 183.36 B: [laughter] 

188.13 191.71 B: oh man doesn't that doesn't that get you so depressed 

191.43 201.33 A: not if you've grown up this way i mean i've i've kinda grown up with it and and so actually for me when it's when i was in california it was like seventy degrees i was like hot you know 

193.01 194.61 B: oh you grew up up there 

201.05 202.00 B: right 

201.38 207.46 A: [laughter] and when it's like a hundred degrees or ninety degrees you know everybody thinks they're dying here so 

202.44 203.32 B: [laughter] 

206.59 208.48 B: [laughter] 

207.57 217.82 A: it's all in your blood stream i know people that moved from california to here and they went around wearing jackets most of the year for the first five years you know [laughter] till they got used to it but 

214.48 215.39 B: right 

218.17 221.33 A: (( yeah yeah anyway )) 

222.10 224.83 A: (( la la la la la la [laughter] )) 

224.14 227.81 B: (( right [laughter] minimum wage okay [laughter] )) 

226.82 228.52 A: minimum wage 

228.49 230.35 B: [laughter] ten minutes so 

230.17 244.92 A: yeah i mean i don't own a business so it wouldn't you know affect me directly but i could see how it would totally you know it would be difficult on the whole economy if you raised it too much at a time and you can't raise it unfairly compared to how everybody else's wages are raised every year and 

239.37 240.21 B: right 

244.26 247.44 B: yeah but depending on where you live like if you live out here

247.81 248.40 A: (( [noise] )) 

248.72 249.98 A: you could spend [noise] 

250.56 262.37 A: exactly exactly yeah that's why i'm that's why it lends me to think that there is [noise] some variation by state and i'm just wondering if this is like the law for this is what your minimum can be for minimum wage or 

251.40 253.14 B: at you know you'd have 

253.80 254.92 B: (( well what do you do ))
