72.98 74.31 B: (( [cough] let's see )) 

74.36 75.31 B: (( um )) 

75.73 76.81 B: i think 

77.12 83.36 B: personally you know just my personal experience i don't have any kids or anything like that but 

83.82 88.88 B: the violence in today's youth and i think it has a lot to do with i'm on the phone 

89.04 92.29 B: um i think a lot has to do with um 

93.08 94.13 B: (( um )) 

97.58 105.30 B: the t._v.s the radios um the kind of materials that that they are looking at without their parental permission 

105.44 109.95 B: um especially a lot of violence on television it's uh these games that they have out 

109.76 110.91 A: oh yeah 

110.30 120.58 B: and you know a lot of people don't they don't understand that you know a a child has to be taught how to do certain things um you 

118.48 119.48 A: mhm 

120.66 125.12 B: know and the cartoons and and the games that they have now they're so violent and 

125.81 133.35 B: they don't their mind can't comprehend that joe blow got killed but he was back on the next segment 

133.37 143.78 B: you see so- i'm saying and they they have these guns and these weapons and stuff and you know they don't really don't have the the mentality to have it to actually fathom that 

133.64 134.51 A: right 

134.76 135.61 A: yeah 

143.83 145.52 B: this is something that's 

145.71 146.73 B: you know 

146.76 153.40 B: serious yeah this is this is not pretend this is not pretend this is this is reality 

147.93 149.38 A: that it's pretend 

151.08 151.94 A: yeah 

153.00 154.14 A: mhm 

153.56 155.04 B: and 

155.15 166.91 B: if you don't if somebody doesn't take t- the president and and putting their foot down saying look this is the material that's appropriate that's appropriate you know because the maybe the parents don't have the whether all 

167.10 169.36 B: to you know to be able to to um 

170.26 171.59 B: to actually 

171.63 182.75 B: know the difference between what's good material and what's not just give them the benefit of the doubt well maybe they're not paying attention maybe because you know today's youth most of them are latch key kids anyway you know they don't have um 

174.76 176.52 A: maybe they're not paying attention 

180.65 181.55 A: right 

182.80 185.56 B: may- maybe if they're lucky they have one parent home 

185.41 186.27 A: right 

186.11 190.15 B: okay if they got two parents both of them probably working full time jobs 

189.95 190.94 A: mhm 

190.30 194.28 B: you know probably two full time jobs just to make it ahead you know what i'm saying 

194.19 195.01 A: right 

194.22 206.59 B: so they're not probably monitoring them you know the kind of material they read or or their activities period so somebody has to bear it you know what i'm saying i think the schools should have that right 

206.49 210.49 B: public and private um neither one should be you know 

210.60 212.58 B: you know neither one should have 

212.64 220.97 B: you know it shouldn't be the there shouldn't be like okay the private schools versus the public school i think both of them should have the the right to do that 

220.93 224.00 A: and who who do you think should make that decision in schools 

223.90 231.55 B: who the board of directors definitely the principals the teachers um it should be it should be set up in their policies [sigh] excuse me 

232.09 237.31 B: it should be already read in the policies if it's not read in the policy an addendum should be made to the policy 

237.24 244.08 B: um and you know and the parents have a problem with that they can go to the little old p._t._a. meetings what have you be and voice their opinions or 

243.99 253.52 B: whatever you know um i'm all for that too but i i do believe that that you know someone need to be screening the material they're reading you know 

252.75 254.54 A: mhm mhm 

254.38 258.36 B: that's just my little input i may be the i may be off track or something but 

258.65 264.14 B: i don't know i just that that's my little is that my five minutes [laughter] 

262.38 267.40 A: [laughter] well i i agree with you um 

266.52 267.34 B: uh-huh 

267.44 272.15 A: i have three school age children i have a ten year old boy 

271.77 272.77 B: mhm 

272.18 275.12 A: an eleven year old boy and a twelve year old girl 

274.80 275.68 B: (( okay )) 

275.68 280.07 A: and um they do they do have to do a lot of reading for school 

279.64 280.69 B: (( mhm )) 

280.38 285.90 A: and i'm probably on the very conservative side of parents they they go to public school 

285.52 286.32 B: okay 

286.30 292.81 A: um but we happen to be christians we go to church every week and a lot of our friends have kids that go to private christian school 

292.42 293.26 B: (( okay )) 

293.07 300.64 A: but we chose to send our kids to public school and i actually don't agree with one of the books that they did read 

300.33 301.35 B: really 

301.14 305.32 A: um they had to read harry potter and the chamber of secrets 

304.86 305.66 B: okay 

305.51 308.87 A: which is like about mysticism and and witchcraft 

308.49 309.49 B: mhm 

308.92 312.13 A: magic and and we really don't believe in that 

311.70 312.55 B: (( okay )) 

312.78 314.46 A: (( [lipsmack] but if figured )) 

315.17 324.11 A: you know hopefully upbringing that we're giving the children has more influence tha- on them than one book that they're required to read for school 

323.77 324.53 B: (( okay )) 

324.87 332.08 A: you know so i i do believe the schools have the right to censor the books but i don't believe they're tough enough on what they're 

332.35 334.59 A: what they're allowing the kids to read 

334.92 337.00 B: [lipsmack] and that's that was mainly 

337.04 339.98 B: that potter and the harry potter thingy 

339.84 340.77 A: yeah 

341.23 343.61 B: by it being such a popular movie 

343.55 344.56 A: yeah 

344.13 348.33 B: um that's that's that might be one of the reason why they selected that material 

348.16 353.12 A: oh i'm sure because they wanted they want to have the kids read things that they're interested in 

348.38 349.24 B: uh 

352.36 353.98 B: (( yeah definitely )) 

353.71 365.09 A: which is very good because the kids wanna read things they're interested in if they make them read stuff about you know pottery back in the sixteen hundreds they don't give a a rats butt about pottery in the sixteen hundreds 

361.79 363.47 B: they don't get into that [laughter] 

364.27 365.18 B: true 

365.58 368.53 A: so they have to give 'em things they're interested in 

367.98 368.95 B: mhm 

368.60 374.20 A: but the only time it creates a problem is when the parents don't agree with what they're making the children read 

373.70 374.52 B: true 

374.64 384.83 A: but i think it's the parents you know th- if i went to one of my kid's teachers and said i don't want my child to read harry potter she would definitely let me pick an alternate book 

384.34 385.61 B: good 

385.12 387.12 A: that wouldn't be a problem but 

386.55 387.21 B: (( okay )) 

387.53 394.31 A: you know for a lot of parents they get their nose bent out of sh- then they pull their kids out of school and they end up home schooling their children 

393.62 394.73 B: mhm 

394.60 396.59 A: because they don't want 'em exposed 

394.78 395.84 B: (( and then a- )) 

395.97 397.48 B: and then did you know i 

397.88 399.57 B: that right there 

400.46 403.50 B: i think the home schooling thingy 

403.63 407.54 B: i it's i- i- it has its pros and cons um 

406.40 407.40 A: mhm 

407.55 416.67 B: you know the the pros is the child's getting a lotta attention [lipsmack] gets a lo- is getting you know might be getting the required uh materials that that person needs 

411.09 411.88 A: yeah 

416.71 420.54 B: but that child also misses out on 

420.70 422.16 A: socialization 

420.90 435.66 B: the natural yeah the socialization skills the natural bonding you know what i'm saying the childhood bo- i missed that a lot you know the that childhood bonding process by moving around a lot you know i'm from new york and um and um 

423.68 424.74 A: mhm 

431.41 432.40 A: yeah 

433.46 434.59 A: oh okay 

436.08 437.59 B: (( i left there when i was young )) 

437.64 447.16 B: and i came to the south and it was a big difference um uh the first place i went to in the south was alabama and it's that's 

447.39 450.96 B: no reflection on you or anything like that but it's redneck city 

450.66 451.85 A: right right 

451.01 460.04 B: and they own up to it you know so it's not i'm not saying anything you know that they don't know or anything like that [laughter] but they own up to it um and i was so 

452.53 453.61 A: mhm 

457.74 458.63 A: yeah 

460.61 467.25 B: how can i say i guess i was blindsided or i maybe i was just i don't know ignorant of the fact of um 

467.02 469.42 A: well you were a child you had no idea 

467.27 468.69 B: the mentality 

469.15 483.25 B: well not only that it's the fact you know we don't do you know the racial thing wasn't really a big thing in new york you know we didn't you know it wasn't like that i had friends who were white chinese puerto rican whatever they be and it was it was cool but when i got to the south 

475.56 476.63 A: mhm 

483.55 486.85 B: i noticed more you know more of the caucasian 

486.89 487.87 B: (( um )) 

488.03 495.62 B: race i gravitated towards them most because the african americans were like real standoffish and how you it was like 

495.65 506.18 B: i can't understand that you know it just didn't you know it just you know and i was like perplexed there for many many years but i missed out a lotta that that you know 

497.36 498.45 A: yeah 

507.09 517.98 B: like for instance like okay like if i go to a family reun- i mean not a family but a my classroom my my uh [noise] high school reunion i'm not gonna know too many people because we didn't really go through you know that whole process together 

511.39 512.66 A: right right 

512.92 513.80 A: yeah 

517.64 523.16 A: you didn't get that chance to go to kindergarten with the same kids and graduate high school with those same kids 

518.82 521.64 B: i didn't get that chance yeah 

522.29 535.86 B: yes definitely and they miss that with the home school i i'm not saying i'm against home schooling i'm you know uh if you can get the education get it you know i went to parochial school also [lipsmack] 

523.23 524.80 A: yeah yeah 

525.46 526.43 A: yeah 

529.38 530.33 A: yeah 

533.10 533.97 A: right 

536.02 542.55 B: um and that was pretty cool versus public school so i've got that you know that experience of having both 

542.38 543.30 A: yeah 

542.64 545.49 B: um but there's nothing like 

546.33 547.82 B: that bonding 

547.98 551.27 B: (( that i i'm trying to think of [mn] a part- it's a particular )) 

548.24 549.18 A: right 

551.63 554.83 B: word that i'm looking for and i just can't grasp it right now but anyway 

553.85 557.84 A: you know what it is it's it's you don't learn the relationship skills 

557.23 559.56 B: yes something is missing 

558.04 563.46 A: because you don't you don't have to go through a long term relationship with anybody because you're moving 

562.99 564.75 B: yes definitely 

564.39 571.07 A: you don't have to work out problems and and figure out who are your real friends and whose not because you're not there long enough really to worry about it 

570.45 579.22 B: and that's the same thing with the home schooling you know you don't have that you know that that option of or that luxury of of certain things that 

572.46 573.37 A: yeah 

579.48 582.70 B: you know that we did when we was in high school and elementary school 

582.36 583.50 A: right right 

583.24 590.67 B: but back to the public thing and the private thing have we talked ten minutes yet [laughter] i'm at work you know i got my i got one ear 

587.62 588.61 A: [laughter] 

590.85 597.63 B: doing what i'm doing here and i'm trying to have a um a an intelligent conversation with you [laughter] 

595.78 597.56 A: [laughter] 

597.65 598.97 B: and i'm tired 

598.12 599.89 A: i don't i don't think it needs to be
