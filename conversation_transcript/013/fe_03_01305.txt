133.94 135.01 B: oh okay well that's

138.96 140.99 B: that wendy does a really good job and

143.36 143.83 B: um 

144.07 149.12 A: yeah i think she does (( )) i for some reason i i haven't really gotten a lead that has 

144.30 144.59 B: (( )) 

149.65 151.75 A: has helped me yet but or 

150.89 151.75 B: oh okay 

151.91 153.28 A: or else i was uh 

153.80 156.69 A: it was the wrong date or i was going to be traveling or something that 

156.46 159.03 B: right that something that well let's stick with it um 

159.43 162.13 B: it i guess my the the fee that i paid it 

162.50 164.68 B: paid itself off i think within like three days 

164.60 165.32 A: wow 

165.36 169.03 B: yeah she she was really on the ball she was sending me things and 

169.45 169.95 B: in it 

170.14 173.61 B: i like her service because for me you know um 

174.11 175.39 B: being so busy with my kids 

175.56 176.90 B: the little ones and everything 

177.07 178.56 B: i don't have the time it seems 

178.95 183.88 B: uh in a day to log on i think a lot of the people that are snagging these jobs 

184.48 186.62 B: they get them as soon as they pop up you know and 

186.81 187.81 B: i'm not online

190.87 192.92 B: you know usually i'm on earlier in the morning then 

193.15 194.18 B: late at night but 

193.99 194.49 A: mhm 

194.66 196.65 B: that was just my philosophy and i thought well 

197.26 199.82 B: you know with her helping me out just sending them to me that 

200.25 202.38 B: saves me going to those certain sites you know and 

202.33 204.06 A: i thought it would help me because it i thought 

202.95 203.38 B: looking 

204.69 208.85 A: i was in a lot an area where there's a lot of competition so i thought i might
