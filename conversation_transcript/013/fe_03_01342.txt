98.89 102.36 A: okay what do you think about censorship in public schools [laughter] 

102.30 106.52 B: um well i i have two different thoughts on it i guess that's 

107.93 112.54 B: um depends on what ah the topic is ah but i 

113.19 115.82 B: have mixed feelings on whether 

116.64 120.21 B: religion should be censored or versus 

120.58 125.59 B: i guess science and then there's also 

126.04 130.75 B: fiction and um depending on content 

130.81 136.46 B: but i also have feelings on on what um who gets to decide what's censored 

136.88 138.82 A: yeah yeah i do too 

138.64 140.12 B: yeah so 

139.20 141.91 A: (( ah personally ah )) 

142.54 143.39 A: (( ah )) 

145.03 151.46 A: just my opinion of course but but ah i i was sorry when they removed the prayer from the schools 

146.58 147.31 B: (( yes )) 

151.22 152.91 B: yeah 

152.48 159.70 A: i think if you're allowed to have a choice then it should be your choice to be able to pray 

160.07 162.05 A: not to just not pray 

162.53 163.43 B: right 

162.83 167.98 A: they removed the it seemed like to me they removed the choice from the people that wanted to pray 

168.39 170.32 A: they no longer have choice 

170.85 172.67 B: they no longer have what 

171.01 171.95 A: (( you know )) 

172.50 177.54 A: it it seemed like they removed the choice from the people that wanted to have prayer 

177.62 180.88 A: ah they no longer had a choice it just 

180.55 185.83 B: right what was the and what prayer do you mean the 

181.25 182.48 A: (( no prayer )) 

186.60 187.87 B: morning prayer 

187.81 195.37 A: yeah you know i i understand that that ah different cultures have different ah 

195.56 197.95 A: religions in different ah 

199.57 200.59 A: (( well )) 

201.88 204.03 A: i can't think of a word there 

204.77 207.32 A: ah object that they pray to 

207.10 208.19 B: mhm 

207.58 210.89 A: and maybe they could just have ah 

211.07 216.52 A: a couple of minutes of silent time you could either say to yourself 

216.59 219.98 A: what you wanted to or not say what you wanted to [laughter] 

219.83 220.96 B: yeah 

220.36 224.04 A: i don't know i understand that everybody doesn't 

224.37 225.84 A: (( isn't ah )) 

226.37 233.01 A: a protestant or a catholic and everybody doesn't say the lord's prayer but 

231.98 233.75 B: mhm 

233.33 234.11 A: (( i )) 

234.49 237.54 A: think that things got worse in the school when they 

237.81 239.54 A: stopped doing all that 

239.47 241.48 B: oh yeah 

241.08 242.41 A: in my opinion 

241.98 243.61 B: yeah i'm not sure um 

243.95 246.28 B: well as i guess 

246.65 251.98 A: but my children are older and so they were in school when the prayers were stopped 

252.11 252.95 A: so 

252.27 253.96 B: right 

253.07 258.20 A: so there was some years of their schooling that they did say the prayer 

258.01 261.15 B: yeah well i i grew up in 

259.07 260.21 A: (( and )) 

261.19 263.79 B: school in saying the prayer um 

263.98 265.40 B: every day but i 

266.23 276.18 B: um but i'm not christian and so it didn't really make sense to me i was saying this prayer that i didn't know about anything about and so and 

271.31 272.38 A: uh-huh 

275.76 280.21 A: you probably didn't appreciate being forced to say something that you didn't 

279.62 283.93 B: yeah i didn't i was pretty young so i didn't really know that i was being forced and if i 

283.99 290.52 B: i mean if i if i didn't want to i wouldn't participate i would just stand there and say nothing but i didn't really know what it meant 

290.51 295.21 A: well you know it's funny because i'm a catholic and grew up catholic 

295.31 300.46 A: and in the lord's prayer we don't say the last part of it catholics 

301.00 311.41 A: for thine is the kingdom you know that part of it and so when the other people around me would be saying that i would just be silent [laughter] 

304.17 305.27 B: right 

311.12 312.28 B: yeah 

311.67 315.69 A: and it never bothered me that they said a different prayer 

315.84 320.41 A: than i didn't really say a different prayer i just omitted the end of 

319.31 319.99 B: right 

320.63 325.19 B: but by keeping by keeping that prayer in there they are kind of not really 

320.86 322.93 A: (( it i'm like you )) 

325.27 327.97 B: they're only catering to the christians 

327.51 331.84 A: yeah they were only catering to protestants and i didn't raise about it 

332.15 333.22 B: but i mean 

332.37 333.47 A: (( you know )) 

333.41 339.09 B: but i mean you had the option of not saying the last bit but for me none of it made sense to me 

339.22 343.54 B: so i know to me it makes more sense for them to take it out because 

339.40 340.78 A: yeah 

343.63 348.77 B: you know there may be a lot of people that are not christian or whatever and they don't or they don't 

349.29 353.70 B: believe in any religion or they don't say they don't say prayers so um 

353.86 357.52 B: maybe they should have a moment of ssilence for everybody or maybe they should have a ah 

358.36 360.04 B: maybe they should have a 

360.74 367.50 B: everyone gets a headset and gets to pick your own prayer or something give them a choice i don't know but ah 

364.46 365.80 A: yeah 

367.80 373.05 B: it makes it doesn't make sense to me that they can have choose one prayer for everybody 

373.53 375.16 A: well yeah that's true 

375.09 375.88 B: (( yes )) 

375.60 376.64 A: (( um of )) 

377.13 382.94 A: course back when i was going to school it was a long time ago and and 

383.21 384.28 A: we didn't 

384.62 386.07 A: really consider 

386.92 388.57 A: ah a lot of 

388.83 399.12 A: rights of other people [laughter] including including this is our prayer so you're going to say it and ah yeah you you make a valid point there 

391.02 391.84 B: yeah 

395.09 396.03 B: (( yeah )) 

398.92 399.73 B: mhm 

399.63 402.36 A: and ah i just 

402.43 404.21 A: to me it just 

405.70 410.90 A: you know i just i just really hated for 'em to take it out it it seemed like 

412.14 413.74 A: well i just don't know 

413.79 414.59 A: if 

414.08 423.30 B: so um you seem to agree to agree with me when you say that it doesn't make sense for them to have the prayer in there because it doesn't make it doesn't pertain to everybody 

422.57 424.82 A: yeah it doesn't pertain to everybody 

423.53 430.28 B: but you also want you didn't you seemed you're saying it's a shame that they took it out so you'd like to have a different option that they 

429.50 437.36 A: i'm kind of divided yeah i'd like to have like i said earlier maybe ah an option where 

437.62 444.12 A: everybody would get together i don't i don't know how it was in your school but in mine we all gathered in the auditorium 

443.96 444.90 B: right 

444.29 445.38 A: and ah 

445.71 448.66 A: they said the pledge of allegiance and the morning prayer 

448.49 449.48 B: right 

448.89 449.98 A: (( and ah )) 

450.03 457.01 A: maybe they could just gather all gather in there and just have a couple of moments of ah ssilence 

457.14 458.00 B: right 

457.36 460.02 A: and ah reflect upon 

460.08 461.53 A: peace or something 

461.93 463.59 B: yeah 

462.53 467.39 A: instead of a prayer maybe peace or or ah 

468.34 470.30 A: caring about one another 

470.33 472.31 B: yeah that's a good idea 

470.98 472.00 A: (( you know )) 

473.18 476.78 B: yeah respecting each other i mean that would be that would go a long way 

476.66 478.59 A: yeah yeah it would 

478.83 481.17 B: yeah so um 

482.83 485.65 B: yeah i guess for us it was ah 

485.99 493.93 B: we were just in our in our classrooms in the morning and it would be announced over the p._a. system the prayer so ah 

493.83 496.39 A: yeah my children ah when they were 

496.52 501.92 A: ah going to school i think that's how they did it just in in the classroom 

499.27 500.95 B: right 

502.04 502.85 B: (( ahah )) 

503.20 504.97 B: so what part of ah 

505.15 510.45 B: what ah where are you calling from or where are you connected from houston 

508.47 511.13 A: houston ah houston texas 

510.68 511.90 B: oh yeah 

511.62 512.64 A: where are you 

512.67 515.14 B: i'm in ah in canada in toronto 

515.08 517.10 A: oh really cool 

516.00 516.82 B: yeah 

517.71 519.75 B: yeah so ah 

520.58 522.64 B: um i guess ah 

523.12 525.51 B: what other kind of censorships are there i mean there's 

525.84 527.04 B: for me i'm 

528.01 529.94 B: i can think of um 

530.53 535.95 B: when i when i think of the word censorship i think of ah you know some large companies like 

536.87 540.77 B: indigo or chapters or large book companies that are 

540.79 541.95 B: um 

542.87 551.55 B: censoring things because they decide not to carry something and and the big come the big book stores that they that they get to 

546.48 547.82 A: yeah 

552.27 556.89 B: you know they they ah wipe out a lot of the small companies 

557.08 565.88 B: and then the small companies would have been around to serve the smaller markets where they you know those books are not where those you know where those books are 

565.90 567.78 B: people need those books but then 

567.98 572.78 B: if chapters is taking over for all those small companies [noise] and they're cornering more of the market then 

572.84 575.90 B: they get to decide who gets what and pretty soon 

576.06 578.23 B: you know they'll be 

579.11 589.92 B: they'll be deciding what books we read and i'm sure it translates to the school too they won't ah if they don't ah they don't like something to censor 

589.13 590.30 A: they've been doing 

590.32 594.19 A: they've been doing that for years censoring books in schools 

592.30 593.02 B: (( sorry )) 

595.01 597.15 A: weren't weren't they in your school 

596.94 598.61 B: weren't they doing what
