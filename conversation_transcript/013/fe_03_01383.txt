31.61 35.49 A: okay do you i take it you like it there you've been there sixteen years 

35.03 42.31 B: it's it's more laid back than than illinois and you don't have to deal with the the rough harsh winters 

41.79 45.01 A: well you're absolutely right absolutely 

43.16 49.17 B: [laughter] i i don't i don't miss the winters up there at all 

48.92 52.47 A: that's good that's you know you're the first person 

52.45 56.42 A: who i've ever talked to that was born here 

56.40 69.84 A: and moved to a warmer climate and hasn't said that you miss the cold or the snow you're the first person that's said you don't miss it and i find that so refreshing because i wouldn't miss it either 

63.72 66.81 B: [laughter] 

69.28 75.00 B: [laughter] yeah so okay 

71.89 73.31 A: (( [sigh] )) 

73.91 80.26 A: so today's topic is should censorship it's about censorship should students be 

80.45 85.58 A: um banned from reading certain books is that what i read is that what i heard rather 

84.17 91.86 B: yes is this is a paid survey are we getting paid for this okay i wasn't i wasn't sure 

87.73 88.58 A: (( yeah )) 

88.77 89.64 A: yes 

91.75 104.03 B: okay um one of um the the subjects that's going around in oklahoma is uh the right for children to read the bible in school is that in illinois yet 

104.06 105.27 A: (( um )) 

105.37 106.93 A: no it's not 

106.66 114.39 B: okay well they are offering it in oklahoma as a secondary choice to social studies 

114.01 115.34 A: oh really 

114.72 124.41 B: yeah i think it's a good idea because i think uh i think there's lots that can be learned from reading that book uh any 

115.50 116.61 A: (( that's interesting )) 

117.02 118.25 A: that's interesting 

124.37 132.14 B: any time you know there's so much in it that is culture and and um you know biblical and 

131.98 144.01 B: and so i don't think it should be censored from the schools i think they should have the right to choose whether or not they can read the bible in school or not what do you think 

142.45 148.88 A: i like the idea of choice because choice does not infringe upon 

149.88 153.28 A: different people's religions or religious beliefs 

153.00 155.26 B: i believe that right 

154.93 160.18 A: so so choice is is good i i don't like that it would be mandatory 

157.09 158.47 B: yeah 

160.22 166.10 A: for everyone because then i believe it would infringe upon people's rights but 

165.31 172.94 B: right because it's not right for everybody no you know i un- uh but i do believe that choice is a good thing for children to 

172.74 181.41 B: have it uh one way or the other if they would like to choose to read it as a secondary book in school i think they should have that option 

181.14 183.82 A: definitely that's that's not a bad thing 

183.49 194.97 B: no and what about um okay censorship pornography definitely no they i don't think it should have any place in schools 

194.39 196.38 A: definitely not i agree 

196.17 210.10 B: um it now i know that it it's uh some people kinda tend to think that it's a um [lipsmack] um breaking their uh one of their rights uh for freedom of speech 

210.23 211.93 B: but i think 

211.99 217.44 B: filters would be good you know like in the libraries and stuff where they have um 

217.39 230.56 B: uh people coming in from different areas and um i think you know a lot of times i use the public library for porna- pornography and and i think that 

230.99 241.04 B: i think it needs to be filtered where the kids don't see it you know i i don't i don't believe that certain age children have any right to 

241.10 243.11 B: that kind of um 

245.12 246.62 B: what do you think 

246.42 249.23 A: i i agree i agree that uh 

249.96 251.33 A: children 

251.66 253.83 A: and i would say uh 

254.17 260.84 A: eighteen and under and eighteen may be be a bit old but eight- definitely eighteen and under minors 

261.16 271.29 A: don't have the right to choose whether or not they want pornography or not or or should have access to pornography or not i- i don't believe that they have that right 

272.21 278.33 B: right i and and they're they're they're not an adult yet and e- they're still 

276.29 277.25 A: right 

278.40 289.04 B: a teenager and uh you know back when i was coming up uh it was a law you couldn't drink until you were twenty one well i kinda believe the same thing about 

289.27 302.90 B: pornographic and and you know x. rated material and stuff i i'm still live a bit more like the old type world does i'm not caught up with the the fast moving pace of uh 

302.99 309.42 B: of um exploitation and [lipsmack] i just don't see it 

308.70 315.71 A: [noise] i agree i agree with that i believe that kids are growing up too fast nowadays anyway 

315.30 316.80 B: mhm 

316.44 320.23 A: and they're exposed to a lot more than i was as a child 

319.91 323.53 B: mhm keep 'em children longer 

323.67 324.98 A: that's right 

324.65 325.71 B: you know 

325.49 326.68 A: (( well uh )) 

325.68 340.64 B: i think if we got rid of uh some of the stuff that that that should be censored you know the pornography and and bad language and and gangs i think if they they used more interest to 

340.77 348.83 B: keep children away from that sort of thing that they would grow up happier and healthier and um 

349.59 351.82 B: you know but getting 

351.84 358.62 B: getting to the root of it and eliminating it i just [mn] there w- how do you do that 

358.47 372.33 B: you know how do you get rid of all the vulgarity and and the pornography and just you know i how do you do that how do you keep it out of their their sight and out of their schools and 

371.95 375.61 A: (( [noise] and you can't b- at least [cough] [mn] )) 

377.19 382.55 A: to me a beginning always is in the home if you 

381.62 383.34 B: definitely 

382.74 388.52 A: if you teach your child that that exists because it does 

387.94 388.90 B: mhm 

388.67 389.64 A: uh 

389.79 393.26 A: but then offer then- m- them an alternative 

393.99 398.93 A: or a um a very plausible explanation or reason why 

399.18 403.18 A: they should not participate in that in that behaviour 

402.91 404.86 B: mhm 

403.71 404.87 A: uh 

405.52 409.19 A: then half of the battle is won 

409.23 412.42 B: right but then they're faced with peer pressures 

412.45 421.76 B: you know peer pressures that say oh come on try this let's do this um you know and and they get wrapped up into the 

422.17 434.19 B: the the fun of it right now you know they don't think about the long term consequences and and that's where they end up with problems 

429.71 430.55 A: sure 

434.44 435.73 B: but um 

435.76 439.45 B: i i really think that they need to censor 

439.53 444.02 B: uh use more filters in what they're putting on the internet 

443.98 455.05 B: you know um i don't think children should have access or be able to accidentally drop into a site where uh they shouldn't be 

455.16 456.33 A: i agree 

455.34 467.72 B: you know i i think they're setting theirselves up for a disaster either uh by some pervert or um you know online or in public you know they could be blotched 

467.71 470.55 B: and um i really think they need to 

470.58 477.09 B: find a way to filter it where the kil- kids just don't happen to stumble into it 

477.26 479.99 B: certain passwords or something 

481.14 485.31 A: right mm and and that's gonna be very hard to regulate 

484.67 486.32 B: mhm 

485.69 489.86 A: very hard so i i guess it would come down to filters in the home 

490.65 494.52 B: yeah through the [mn] by your home computer 

494.27 494.99 A: (( yeah )) 

495.01 497.11 B: yeah that's a good idea though 

497.99 511.46 B: i don't have it on my computer yet but my little girl doesn't really have uh uh that much to do with it right now she's just starting to get the feel of computers and and she is eleven 

508.84 510.07 A: how old is she 

511.25 512.21 A: (( okay ))

517.29 520.94 B: oh well you know what my oldest daughter is thirty three 

521.13 523.81 A: (( and you have an eleven year old ))
