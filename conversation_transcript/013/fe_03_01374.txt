0.23 1.42 A: hello 

1.49 4.68 B: hello uh what's this about 

4.09 8.28 A: i think it said um do you think the government has the right to 

8.41 12.05 A: prevent students from reading certain books in school 

12.33 17.65 B: okay um when i picked up the phone there was a recording already in progress 

17.30 19.86 A: okay did did you did you 

17.97 23.74 B: and uh i i i don't know whether this is uh some sort of polling outfit or or what 

23.15 30.95 A: okay well i knew what was going on because i had signed up for it it's a it's like a study a research study type thing and i think it's to um 

31.97 41.48 A: uh to learn how people i don't know communicate or something um and so they just present a topic and then we're supposed to like talk about it for ten minutes or something like that 

34.84 36.19 B: [laughter] 

37.66 38.73 B: yeah 

41.13 44.05 B: oh that's that's okay are are they paying you for it 

43.84 46.77 A: yeah it's like supposed to be ten dollars a call 

47.27 49.05 B: oh um 

48.15 50.41 A: (( did you not sign up for this or )) 

49.94 57.42 B: i don't know exactly what's going on with it but uh it's quite possible that someone else here did so um i'll just go ahead with it 

51.76 52.76 A: not sure 

55.60 58.09 A: mhm okay 

57.48 60.92 B: uh regarding the the uh school book issue 

60.95 65.82 B: uh i used to be a teacher out in california so i have a a bit of a bias on that 

63.96 64.77 A: oh 

65.49 67.16 A: well you come and yeah 

66.92 68.60 B: yeah 

67.28 68.59 A: well that's interesting 

68.78 69.87 B: yeah 

68.82 70.23 A: so what do you think 

69.99 74.08 B: [lipsmack] well i think that at the college level 

73.40 74.27 A: mhm 

74.23 77.32 B: there should be no censorship whatsoever 

77.40 81.07 B: you know you're you know by the time you get to college you're on your own 

81.00 83.20 B: and you you make your own choices 

82.87 83.70 A: right 

83.14 96.43 B: but for the elementary school and the high school levels uh yeah gradually you have to open it up and you have to realize that kids are curious about what they're curious about and they should at least be able to get the truth about things 

88.81 90.50 A: mhm 

92.44 93.33 A: mhm 

95.55 97.34 A: mhm so do you think 

97.52 106.41 A: any topic is is okay as long as it's age appropriate or do you think there are just some topics that should be prohibited depending on the age or 

105.23 109.26 B: well i think that some topics are not age appropriate 

108.66 110.79 A: yeah well uh yeah 

109.65 123.29 B: but uh you know as far as you know as far as for an adult i would say no censorship whatsoever and i would consider college students to be effectively adults even though they're [laughter] don't really show up much maturity yet 

122.83 126.35 A: no it usually takes a few more years than [laughter] 

124.81 135.13 B: yeah but you know y- you have to pretty much uh say okay this is where the line is you you get out of high school you go into college you're you're an adult for general purposes so 

129.13 130.87 A: mhm 

135.18 142.38 B: uh the whole point of college is to be able to study anything and hopefully to find out what the truth about things is 

138.99 139.96 A: mhm 

141.99 144.74 A: n- what grade did you teach or what did you teach 

144.11 153.11 B: uh i worked as a sub so i covered a lot of grades but i tended to specialize around uh uh twelfth grade uh tenth grade uh history civics things of that nature 

152.73 155.08 A: okay so you dealt with the older kids then 

153.13 159.17 B: yeah yeah um when you're dealing with the uh high school population 

159.59 166.61 B: you're dealing with people that can actually handle some fairly complex ideas and uh they should be given the opportunity to 

163.29 164.66 A: yeah 

166.59 173.31 B: you're also dealing with uh quite a few people who are not mature enough to find a floor with their hat [laughter] so 

171.87 173.61 A: mhm 

173.24 184.75 B: they have to be protected to some extent but uh i think as far as censorship that's a bad word um making available 

184.77 190.21 B: uh things you know being discreet in what you make available is um is okay now you yeah 

187.56 188.54 A: mhm 

189.22 197.79 A: well do you think it's the government 'cause that was i think the question does the government should they be determining that or do you think that should be someone else's 

196.21 196.77 B: (( [cough] )) 

197.13 204.29 B: well that gets into a very interesting thing because a local school board is in essence part of a government 

199.86 200.95 A: yeah 

203.44 205.38 A: yeah the local government yeah 

204.42 211.40 B: yeah so it's at what level do you want it to go now i would say that the at the federal level they should stay out of it 

206.56 208.10 A: mhm 

210.60 211.60 A: yeah 

211.19 221.84 B: and at the state level uh they should set the curriculum and you know the minimum standards for graduation from one grade to the next and possibly some standardized testing along those lines [sigh] 

217.54 218.66 A: mhm 

221.13 221.84 A: mhm 

221.83 231.13 B: but as far as what goes in the library and you know somebody gets a little wild here and wants to ban huck finn or something like that i think that's ridiculous [laughter] you know 

228.72 231.08 A: (( yeah )) 

231.25 238.44 A: do you think kind of local communities should decide for their for themselves as to what they wanna allow and not allow or 

231.72 232.45 B: (( [sigh] )) 

235.85 236.99 B: well 

237.36 241.27 B: you know there's there's always gotta be a balance between 

241.18 255.90 B: uh local community and national community and the individual's rights now you know kids basically are learning how to handle their rights so they're not really competent yet now i wouldn't wanna hand machiavelli 

244.36 245.48 A: yeah 

246.19 246.99 A: yeah 

252.70 254.00 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

255.82 257.65 B: to a third grader 

257.99 261.86 B: uh he might get some ideas but he may remember what they are 

261.49 262.74 A: (( yeah )) 

261.89 265.36 B: i'd be a little reluctant to hand it to a middle school kid 

264.86 266.85 A: now what book are you talking about 

265.86 268.93 B: uh nicola machiavelli the prince uh 

268.92 279.04 B: this is a politics down and dirty from the uh italian uh renaissance area uh he's he's the guy that advocates the idea that the government the prince 

274.26 275.49 A: (( oh )) 

278.68 280.05 A: mhm 

279.01 291.16 B: has to be above public morality because he has much more responsibilities and he was actually writing for an audience of princes so he was you know telling them what they wanted to hear so they'd pay him 

283.61 284.76 A: oh okay 

290.47 292.29 A: mhm 

291.04 295.03 B: but it's a it's a classic in political thought 

295.14 300.05 B: now it's also uh amoral you know to the point of being 

300.16 306.03 B: oh you know you don't you're not too sure you wanna turn this kinda ideal loose on on undeveloped minds 

305.47 306.35 A: mhm 

306.54 311.40 B: um carl marx uh has done in his book on 

310.80 312.68 A: that's psychologist isn't it 

312.34 317.00 B: uh um no freud was the psychol- psychology guy 

316.91 321.16 A: i just remember i remember that name sounds familiar from when i had a psychology class marx or 

320.43 325.11 B: well he was involved with that too but he was basically in c- in uh communism 

325.24 326.30 A: okay 

325.96 334.52 B: you know he did some he was a german guy and did some work uh beautiful work in economic theory regarding the uses of capital money 

334.37 336.06 A: mhm 

334.53 349.14 B: and then the uh the communist party formed using his ideas and and lenin was the more political one but the ideology was marxist it's like saying american political thought that the ideology is adam smith's um 

341.14 341.88 A: mhm 

349.64 360.08 B: uh wealth of nations or something which is capitalism and it it you know you pretty much like to contrast 'em but if you turn [sigh] something like that loose on 

351.16 352.34 A: mhm 

360.16 362.73 B: a high school kid that is 

362.61 375.63 B: against the control elements in his own society they're liable to hook onto anything that's against what they're against yeah and yeah and this is why you know you get your russian teenagers would 

366.60 368.72 A: mhm 

370.39 373.07 A: and just gonna run with it and yeah 

375.45 383.96 B: would advocate capitalistic ideas just because their parents were communists [laughter] you know it had nothing to do with the rightness or wrongness of the of the system 

377.65 380.46 A: they're against communism yeah 

383.38 386.31 A: it just serves their purpose at that time so 

385.74 396.11 B: yeah well you know kids wanna rebel and they'll rebel against whatever they've got to rebel against so you know you can't really take 'em too seriously but this is how they learn to be serious 

388.98 390.00 A: yeah 

395.87 398.57 A: yeah but also i guess censorship kinda 

398.59 401.96 A: promotes rebellion too don't you think 

401.29 411.93 B: well yeah forbidden fruit tastes sweeter and all that stuff and if you can't you know if you can't get good biological information without a lot of foof around school you're gonna wind up doing your research in playboy 

402.15 403.42 A: [laughter] 

404.32 405.54 A: (( yeah )) 

409.44 410.43 A: yeah 

411.65 412.76 A: yeah 

412.18 416.14 B: which uh you know for adults is one thing but for for kids it's 

416.32 422.67 B: um you know too much fantasy and not enough reality [laughter] 

420.46 427.19 A: yeah don't you find though today that kids know i mean a lot more now at younger ages than what they you know 

427.02 433.13 B: well they they have access to a lot more and their ability to tell 

427.47 428.90 A: used to 

430.53 432.29 A: (( mhm )) 

433.04 448.03 B: the truth from from the fantasy is is not well developed when you see stuff over and over and over and over again on television you start considering it real because you've seen it while in real life you're probably not gonna see it that often you know 

435.09 437.05 A: mhm 

443.08 444.30 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

447.05 448.45 A: yeah 

448.03 455.95 B: um i've seen lots of lot of crime shows on t._v. but the you know actually seeing people getting shot on the street that's pretty rare [laughter] you know 

454.02 459.67 A: yeah well i guess some young minds can't discern necessarily or just 

458.20 471.53 B: yeah and you know it's it's kinda strange because the the violence that you have on t._v. is sanitized and when you run into the real stuff if all you've known is what's on television and you don't know what reality is 

469.17 470.22 A: mhm 

471.08 473.43 A: mhm 

471.59 473.94 B: you know you can't cope with it [lipsmack] 

474.05 479.78 B: you have people go into the military and they take basic training and they get out on the rifle range they learn how to shoot 

479.78 489.00 B: you get 'em in combat and the first time they see actual blood coming out of somebody they're worthless [laughter] you know i mean these are guys that can't wring a chicken's neck and cook it 

482.41 484.43 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

488.02 488.91 A: yeah 

488.99 500.81 B: you know there is something basically off there because they haven't been taught the reality of what life and death is about most of 'em most of 'em learn about morality from their friends being in car wrecks 

493.68 495.26 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

496.41 497.81 A: yeah it's kinda 

500.30 501.34 A: yeah 

500.76 504.69 B: [laughter] this is you know it's strange 

503.71 507.95 A: another thing with the military it's kinda been glorified and idealized and 

507.70 520.55 B: [sigh] well it's uh it's done for a purpose and the purpose generally boils down to keeping as many of your troops alive as possible and winning and um what we've seen in the iraqi situation has been 

514.55 515.33 A: mhm 

520.64 525.74 B: probably the cleanest war we've ever been in as far as our own casualties are concerned 

525.11 525.99 A: yeah 

526.66 530.48 B: and uh [sigh] you know it's it's kind of 

530.61 533.87 B: a good feeling that the the government now 

533.72 546.15 B: cares that much about the individual troop that they try to protect 'em i think that comes with you know you you pay 'em a lot more you train 'em a lot more they become more valuable you don't just send 'em out there with a gun and say you know if you come back we'll pay ya 

537.06 538.87 A: mhm 

546.67 549.42 B: uh which is the way it was for many years 

548.79 549.63 A: yeah 

549.45 550.47 B: (( [sigh] but )) 

550.73 554.05 B: um um i've been monopolizing the conversation what's your thoughts on 

553.51 558.28 A: [laughter] that's okay i'm learning stuff here um 

555.09 555.79 B: it 

556.11 558.45 B: [laughter] 

558.66 568.80 A: i don't know i mean y- you know a lot of what you said i pretty much you know agreed with it's all kind of really it's all kind of relative each situation is individual and you know depending on the 

562.79 563.76 B: (( [laughter] yeah mhm )) 

568.76 576.75 A: age of the child you know what grade they're in and and really you know their level of maturity i think that just kinda depends but i don't think you can really just put a 

576.68 579.95 A: a blanket censorship necessarily on you know 

579.46 581.12 B: yeah 

579.85 588.99 A: on things i think that's why i think it has to somewhat still stay in in the hands of the parents or the just the local community 'cause you have to take 

581.24 582.56 B: (( mhm yeah [sigh] )) 

588.83 597.24 A: individual you know situations and people into consideration when deciding what they need to be exposed to or what needs to be made available to them and stuff 

592.40 594.22 B: mhm 

596.58 599.89 B: yeah [sigh] there is always a dynamic tension between
