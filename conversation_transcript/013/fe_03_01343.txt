43.77 46.15 B: decisions and not a school's decision 

46.68 52.78 A: i absolutely agree with that i also i also i also think that um 

53.21 56.67 A: i think you limit the knowledge that a a child can achieve

79.45 80.73 A: yeah 

82.01 84.26 A: (( [sigh] i agree with that [sigh] )) 

85.64 87.54 B: i don't think censorship is 

87.61 88.33 B: ah 

89.00 90.25 B: censorship 

90.42 91.67 B: is not 

93.64 95.54 B: it's it's a family thing 

96.44 97.25 A: uh-huh 

96.72 98.49 B: parent to child 

98.88 99.84 B: um 

99.86 102.23 B: spouse to spouse as far as that goes 

102.32 106.32 B: but it's not a government thing and it's not a school thing 

106.76 107.69 A: uh-huh 

108.16 111.78 A: well i guess i i definitely agree with you i think um 

112.48 116.47 A: unfortunately i think our country our nation is is getting toward ah 

116.64 124.72 A: more government involvement in a whole lot of areas that are typically [cough] reserved for parents 

124.61 125.71 B: that's right 

125.74 128.77 A: such as yeah exactly 

126.16 127.38 B: for family 

127.96 129.59 B: for families yes 

129.57 131.40 A: and that's kind of scary but 

131.03 134.28 B: well you know we're paying these people to do this 

134.94 136.63 A: (( yeah that's you know )) 

136.64 137.50 B: you know 

137.06 138.05 A: (( censors )) 

137.94 144.46 B: you know and and we're getting government government's going to completely rule our life it's not 

144.47 146.44 B: we're not going to have the freedom 

147.98 150.15 B: you know they're already trying that with guns 

149.98 150.91 A: uh-huh 

150.81 152.91 B: they've been trying that for years with guns 

152.61 153.74 A: yeah

156.75 157.86 A: okay 

157.89 159.00 B: (( and ah )) 

159.20 161.81 B: handguns i don't believe there's a 

163.54 167.23 B: ah i don't know i don't think they need to be as available as they are 

167.89 170.52 B: but if a crook wants them he's going to get it anyway 

170.50 181.92 A: yeah i think i think the the scariest part about the way our government is starting to censor different areas of our lives are the way that they tell us that this is what we want 

178.16 179.14 B: mhm 

182.03 184.81 A: and for some reason we we buy it 

182.32 183.00 B: (( mhm )) 

184.80 186.08 B: well yeah 

186.10 189.77 B: well and we don't have we don't really have rights 

189.98 191.23 B: where do you live

193.43 197.87 B: okay i'm in well i'm in rocks springs wyoming but i do live in denver colorado 

197.51 198.41 A: okay 

198.13 199.62 B: and um 

199.65 206.27 B: but um a few years ago california they took a vote so that they could ah 

206.35 207.23 B: um 

207.82 211.74 B: not have to pay for all the immigrants that were coming in 

211.32 212.27 A: uh-huh 

211.56 225.72 B: and the citizens and and once a woman comes in and has a child then they are a citizen and and then the whole family can be a citizen well california voted against that and they appealed it and california lost now what's the use of having 

218.54 219.41 A: uh-huh 

225.76 227.11 B: the public vote 

226.86 228.24 A: [laughter] 

228.03 230.76 B: if it's not going to stand up what's the use of having it 

230.49 235.01 A: i agree i i i mean i'm aware of ah that they did um 

235.06 239.82 A: have a vote i didn't i didn't follow it to find out what happened that is interesting 

238.40 239.79 B: (( oh yeah )) 

239.85 245.98 B: they've voted that that ah people could not come in and just give birth to a child to make it a citizen 

246.03 253.22 B: and by god the california some some place took california to court and they had an appeal 

253.73 262.24 A: that is that is interesting i mean unfortunately i agree with that law and i agree with the fact because that's a feder- that's a federal law not a state law 

262.15 263.08 B: uh-huh 

262.55 267.44 A: and i know that state laws can't pa- with the states can't pass laws that ah 

267.81 270.50 A: that um go against federal laws 

270.59 271.80 B: (( yeah but that's )) 

270.85 273.35 A: that was interesting all all 

272.76 279.98 B: that's true but how many of us other states have the problem that california does that they have to support all these people 

280.04 280.94 A: (( mm )) 

281.45 284.86 B: california and texas and arizona 

284.65 285.92 A: and florida 

284.91 286.79 B: and florida 

286.92 296.81 B: they get all these people that come in and and california's hit the worst because they come straight up from mexico long enough to have a child and then the whole family can move in 

296.82 300.60 A: uh-huh ah i'm i'm sure they are pregnant when they get here anyway 

297.25 298.86 B: and they're supporting them 

300.72 304.83 B: well well yeah they're pregnant they're ready to deliver 

304.21 305.23 A: uh-huh 

305.08 306.87 B: they come in at eight months 

306.66 308.21 A: uh-huh i'm sure 

307.49 308.24 B: and 

308.46 318.88 B: you know they're not even established they just come in long enough to have that child it's an american citizen then the whole family gets to stay and california is absolutely 

319.15 324.60 B: i mean it's busting their budgets because they have to pay medical on all these people because they don't have jobs 

324.79 326.66 A: wow that's interesting 

326.53 327.71 B: yeah you know 

327.83 330.63 B: so so where is our freedom 

331.20 333.80 B: our freedoms are being taken away more and more every day 

333.94 334.82 A: (( mm )) 

336.04 338.93 A: i i like i said i totally agree 

338.83 340.07 B: (( yeah you know )) 

339.37 341.92 A: it's an interesting situation in california 

341.55 348.55 B: yeah it is and i mean california is a big state there's no doubt about it but as you get more people that are not working 

349.21 352.97 B: than are working then it's going to affect the whole government 

353.90 355.58 B: not just california 

355.35 356.51 A: (( mm mhm )) 

356.30 357.55 B: (( you know so )) 

357.61 362.18 B: anyway that's just my opinion for what it's worth [laughter] 

360.88 364.64 A: [laughter] well like i said i i i definitely agree um 

365.25 366.36 A: (( yeah )) 

365.33 371.45 B: and what california voted on that for was to try and control it not let these people come in 

372.46 375.09 B: in and in a week have a baby 

375.33 377.26 B: and then take up citizenship 

379.56 380.29 A: but 

379.96 385.43 B: we're a free country and anybody has the right to live here there is no doubt but that's not the way to do it 

385.54 390.51 A: (( mhm i agree i agree that is actual fact )) 

396.21 398.26 B: okay so what else do we have to do now 

397.97 401.45 A: an actual fact i think we just have to keep talking about censorship 

401.53 402.59 B: oh okay 

402.21 403.23 A: um 

403.81 410.40 A: you did bring up i mean you brought up an excellent point with the with the guns and and and the fact that we don't have freedoms 

410.33 411.23 B: uh-huh 

411.08 415.16 A: and and you know like i say i just want to reiterate the fact that you know we're taking 

415.56 420.59 A: we're taking the the the raising of the children from the families 

420.45 421.99 B: that's right 

420.75 429.07 A: and just putting it in the hands of the government and what like i said what blows my mind is that they can tell us this is what we want 

429.37 430.68 B: that's right 

429.46 436.59 A: and and almost as if we were in a trance we we we you know shake our head and agree yeah this is what we want 

437.23 438.37 A: and 

437.54 439.16 B: and if we don't want it 

439.32 441.15 B: what do we do to stop it 

439.66 442.59 A: if you talk if you talk to people just just you 

442.64 445.89 A: know people that you come in con- contact on a daily basis 

446.00 452.36 A: and you will see most of them agree with how you feel but yet the country is being ran ran in a different way 

452.62 453.31 B: (( mhm )) 

452.76 458.86 A: you you kinda of wonder you know where are all these people that want the country to be ran the way it's running 

459.83 463.01 A: for them to tell us you know this is what the people want and 

462.72 463.36 B: (( mhm )) 

464.13 468.00 B: make the decisions for us and tell us that's what we've decided 

467.25 469.19 A: exactly exactly yes 

469.39 470.24 B: yeah 

472.38 473.56 A: something else 

472.70 474.74 B: yeah we think we think alike 

475.06 476.93 A: it's it's something else i tell you 

477.29 478.64 B: yeah it is 

482.60 485.14 A: yeah and like i said i i 

485.94 498.57 A: just it it amazes me how how how slow the learning curve would be or how how slow the learning would be itself if we were to censor the ah reading material you know on the kids in school 

498.50 499.74 B: yeah 

499.01 504.78 A: because i mean you know do you gather so much knowledge on your own by reading 

503.04 503.98 B: uh-huh 

505.10 508.84 B: and censorship censorship is ah 

508.99 512.11 B: that should be a family thing it should not be a government thing 

511.74 513.00 A: mhm 

512.87 521.91 A: and and i don't want to say this in the wrong way but i i i somewhat equate the kids in school with the criminals and the guns 

521.79 533.26 A: if the kids want to get material that's censored they're going to get it just like the criminals if they want to get guns they're going to get it or whatever you know whatever whatever's outlawed that you know it's always going to be a market for it 

525.17 526.52 B: that's right 

529.33 530.89 B: that's right 

533.32 535.29 B: that's right that's right 

534.79 535.91 A: so you know 

536.43 538.08 B: that's right 

536.47 538.90 A: i think it's a waste of time it's it's it's 

539.00 542.14 A: adding more bureaucracy as if we need that 

541.94 542.93 B: (( oh yeah )) 

544.12 545.50 B: yeah that's right 

546.24 548.21 A: (( mhm that's very interesting )) 

548.83 549.55 B: yeah 

553.59 554.85 A: (( but um [cough] )) 

556.77 559.39 A: (( like i said i don't have any kids at this time so )) 

559.62 560.77 B: how old are you 

560.72 561.90 A: i'm thirty one 

562.40 564.30 B: oh i'm thirty years older 

564.26 565.70 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

564.92 567.61 B: [laughter] 

568.99 571.38 B: and there's no rush to have them huh 

571.30 575.05 A: no no rush to have 'em i mean you know it's 

571.89 574.08 B: [laughter] 

576.17 589.45 A: i've i've i've wrestled with that decision for a long time as far as you know do i want to raise a kid and and you know in this country and this day and age and i go back and forth so um 

580.75 581.53 B: uh-huh 

586.39 587.22 B: uh-huh 

589.24 589.99 B: yeah 

590.35 592.35 A: as far as today it's no 

592.39 595.17 B: [laughter] 

594.14 597.68 A: no next week next month it may be different but 

596.94 599.89 B: yeah having the right person with you makes the difference
