147.90 159.52 B: but uh let's see why else isn't that a good minimum wage i mean out here we have so many uh migrant workers and you know they'll work for even less than that 

156.59 157.41 A: yeah 

159.31 162.38 A: yeah well here we got people coming in from canada 

159.78 160.59 B: so 

162.31 163.17 B: uh 

162.95 167.30 A: and they take a lot of jobs you know so 'cause they can do it a lot less 

167.37 172.15 A: they take their american money bring it up there and they get a dollar forty on our dollar 

172.07 173.43 B: oh my gosh

176.76 179.98 A: so they get a forty percent increase right off the top 

181.29 186.05 B: but just five dollars an hour that's just ridic- uh five fifteen 

186.40 188.45 B: is absolutely ridiculous it's 

189.09 191.96 B: i can't even imagine trying to live off that

200.04 201.57 A: (( that but )) 

200.86 202.32 B: something like that 

202.34 203.58 B: but

235.40 237.73 B: that definitely would well 

236.97 240.11 A: but i mean that just gives me a lot more bills too so 

241.45 242.76 B: that's well 

243.13 246.67 B: i guess [laughter] i wouldn't know but 

246.73 249.24 B: do you have a problem with people being able to pay the rent 

249.29 252.85 A: um a little bit once in a while not not too often 

251.74 254.48 B: see they're making five fifteen an hour [laughter] 

253.90 261.01 A: [laughter] actually there ain't too many people up here that does make minimum wage most of our jobs do pay more but

318.86 319.83 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

320.01 321.32 B: yeah 

322.66 324.06 B: oh i mean 

324.61 328.35 B: the minimum wage does not reflect the economy it's that simple 

328.55 330.29 A: yeah it doesn't 

330.13 331.31 B: and then 

330.38 334.82 A: and then and then we turn around and we support people that we we're we're gonna bomb 

334.52 335.48 B: right 

334.99 338.82 A: you know it's like oh why don't we just use the money here instead of there 

339.12 340.04 A: you know 

339.86 342.03 B: we have so many homeless 

341.90 343.03 A: yeah 

342.40 345.74 B: and um we have so many street people here 

345.50 350.51 A: i've always said that i've always said that we should help our own and not send money everywhere else 

350.85 354.28 A: i mean you get those people over there that are having you know ten twelve kids 

351.04 352.19 B: yeah 

354.61 355.52 A: you know 

355.17 356.09 B: right 

355.86 357.91 A: and then they they can't even afford one 

358.98 362.14 A: but i don't know it's i guess that's none of my business what they do 

362.20 362.76 A: (( [noise] )) 

362.24 364.04 B: [laughter] 

363.73 367.39 A: but [sigh] but i'm against helping other people until we help ourself first 

366.78 367.74 B: right 

367.63 372.57 A: well and that minimum wage doesn't help us it's helping [laughter] everybody else i guess 

373.08 378.93 B: well i think that they're actually getting more [laughter] than we would get working at minimum wage 

376.37 377.26 A: yeah 

379.24 380.08 B: (( you know )) 

379.98 381.03 A: yeah 

380.44 385.15 B: and they just i mean our state just slaughtered our school 

385.94 399.62 B: and you know here's the president saying he's gonna give more money to schools but the state here is saying take it from the schools first and they're they're thinking about cutting back school hours and school days so they don't go as of- as long 

399.62 400.78 A: yeah 

400.07 401.90 B: you know i what does that do 

401.33 403.58 A: they're talking about adding more to ours [laughter] 

403.04 407.17 B: oh well there you go [laughter] well now i know where ours is going 

404.03 406.16 A: [laughter] well they just 

406.97 408.65 A: our town just built 

409.02 412.70 A: a brand new school so our taxes just tripled so [laughter] 

412.52 413.43 B: oh 

413.26 414.53 A: (( but )) 

414.89 415.75 B: wow 

415.95 421.17 B: well i guess there you're probably in the same boat then that people couldn't live off minimum wage 

421.11 426.26 A: yeah i don't i don't know how they do it the people that live around here uh i think most of the minimum wage people up here 

426.37 428.61 A: are like teenagers still going to school 

428.66 429.45 B: (( oh )) 

428.73 434.43 A: i think if you know if they're out of school and working and living i think they're making more than that 

435.24 438.97 A: but i think it's the teenage kids that are taking the jobs that are minimum wage 

439.22 441.07 B: well do you think there's more 

441.48 444.04 B: work there that's higher paying 

444.36 446.43 A: yeah i think there is um 

444.56 446.33 B: or it's about equal 

446.57 449.36 A: i don't really hear too many people that are getting paid under six 

449.54 451.35 B: yeah 

452.13 457.16 A: so i mean our our little convenience stores our little convenience stores usually start around six fifteen seven 

452.20 454.26 B: yeah i i think minimum wage 

457.19 459.65 A: you know somewhere in that area 

459.08 461.15 B: it's probably like the fast food 

461.38 466.86 A: yeah like wendy's mcdonalds you know the malls the mall type you know younger kids that are 

463.34 464.83 B: yeah 

467.07 471.41 A: part time and stuff like that i think they're somewhere around minimum wage 

471.67 475.47 B: well i guess they could survive but they would have somebody else supporting them 

475.06 477.32 A: yeah exactly yeah 

476.04 479.04 B: you know there's a a family 

477.63 480.34 A: contributing to the household yeah 

479.49 483.33 B: but a a family couldn't live on it even with two parents 

483.81 485.84 B: or two people i would say 

486.07 488.06 B: even if they don't have kids 

488.34 492.02 B: if they were both making mi- minimum wage they still wouldn't be able to 

491.89 497.04 A: hm no i don't i don't see it i don't see it [laughter] i mean if they didn't have kids it would be easier 

492.39 493.72 B: have a household 

497.34 499.40 A: but who doesn't wanna not have ki- you know what i mean 

499.17 500.06 B: right 

499.67 501.71 A: i mean that's just 

501.29 503.89 B: well that's my opinion but [laughter] 

504.57 509.10 A: it's like the um minimum wage goes up so slow as to where 

509.61 513.78 A: the cost of living for like a union goes up like three percent a year 

514.16 516.40 A: the minimum wage doesn't even come close 

516.20 517.43 B: (( oh pshaw )) 

517.10 520.44 A: you know so it's like the union people are getting a lot more a lot faster 

521.11 526.65 A: so they ought i think they oughta set it up so it goes up you know with you know the cost of living 

527.30 528.82 A: which i don't think it is 

528.96 531.69 B: i think my last minimum wage job 

531.71 538.89 B: was in the mid eighties and i started like three i mean um five thirty five i think 

539.02 539.85 A: yeah 

539.23 547.71 B: you know so [laughter] that shows the minimum wage isn't moving much even if ours now is like five eighty five or something 

547.93 550.12 B: i- it still hasn't even gone up a dollar 

550.37 552.26 A: yeah see up here i 

551.10 555.36 B: you know that's ten years that's fifteen years 

552.79 553.48 A: up 

554.24 558.98 A: yeah i haven't i didn't i never started a job like that when i what i did was 

559.16 564.83 A: when i got out of school i did a job i got i started right into sheet rocking so i started right off at seven so 

564.57 565.45 B: yeah 

564.86 566.28 A: i never you know 

566.66 569.15 A: i've never actually had anything under seven but 

569.30 574.15 B: oh well when when i had minimum job minimum wage jobs i had three 

575.38 578.96 B: and i had a young child so he had to come to work with me 

575.56 576.26 A: (( uh-huh )) 

578.66 579.97 A: that must have been rough 

579.69 584.40 B: yeah [laughter] it was it was but that was the only way to survive so 

584.25 586.75 A: (( yeah well )) 

588.15 595.86 A: i mean like i said we struggle and i you know i don't make i don't get paid that bad 'cause i do a lot of overtime you know which is time and a half so 

593.78 594.62 B: uh-huh 

596.09 598.68 A: i couldn't survive if we didn't if i didn't do overtime 

598.54 599.89 B: does your partner work
