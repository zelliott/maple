58.51 60.57 B: ridiculous all i raise is fifteen cents 

72.17 72.91 A: to be (( )) 

72.36 72.77 B: (( )) 

73.35 76.41 B: i think it's to be raised i don't know if it's actually been raised yet 

74.81 75.52 A: right 

76.51 77.24 A: yes 

76.90 79.94 B: um do you know if this is just for the state of pennsylvania or 

80.24 82.29 A: i don't know because i'm in georgia 

80.52 80.99 B: uh 

82.92 83.39 B: oh 

89.07 98.23 A: you know but uh fifteen cents you know but i imagine when you're making that amount fifteen cents look good it looks good when you're making more fifteen cents on the hour you know 

89.43 90.09 B: oh really 

97.23 97.52 B: true 

97.61 97.93 B: true 

98.73 99.46 A: but um 

98.94 99.23 B: true 

99.58 106.97 A: it seem like it's such a little amount but if you in this position and and that's how much you're making every little bit help 

107.67 108.20 A: you know 

107.87 108.20 B: yes 

108.31 108.97 A: mhm 

108.56 110.67 B: definitely i i actually worked um 

111.13 113.12 B: minimum wage over the summer as a lifeguard 

113.53 117.42 B: and uh in north carolina i believe the minimum wage is five twenty five 

113.69 114.59 A: oh okay 

117.66 118.06 A: okay 

117.93 123.72 B: and um it was you know it's it's really not much money and actually a couple dollars does make a huge difference 

124.23 125.16 B: after a while i mean 

125.63 129.68 B: you know or just however much you can get an an extra fifteen cents (( )) 

130.11 131.48 B: it's a much larger percentage 

131.88 136.78 B: um of you know five dollars an hour than of you know thirty dollars an hour or something like that 

136.52 145.32 A: i ye- yes and usually the person who make the lesser amount it seem like they be the one to do the hardest work and also fifteen cents will put you in a different bracket you're paying more tax on it 

152.32 155.59 A: and they are getting by but just getting by the skin of their teeth you know 

155.98 159.11 A: and plus uh if you make fifteen five fifteen an hour 

159.51 164.28 A: uh twenty hour you got to pay for the sa- pay the same amount for when you go to the store to get things 

164.95 167.83 A: so i think it should be more but i i really do believe 

168.27 169.20 A: the reason (( )) 

169.37 174.31 A: ones who pay minimum wages is the companies who don't have as many employees 

174.50 175.36 A: employees yes 

175.88 177.80 A: so that's all they can afford you know 

178.16 181.80 B: true yeah the smaller businesses can't afford really large salaries 

181.56 182.12 A: right 

182.22 182.65 A: right 

182.23 182.63 B: and 

183.33 183.91 B: um 

184.64 185.50 B: uh i guess 

185.79 190.68 B: it it benefits you know uh the gross companies and everything if minimum wage stays low 

190.89 191.24 B: but 

191.52 192.26 B: if someone is 

192.90 194.67 B: if someone is doing a good job you should 

194.87 200.67 B: you know pay them a certain amount and then if they're not doing a good job you should fire them and i mean there should be a minimum wage because 

195.87 197.01 A: right 

198.70 199.65 A: that's true 

201.37 204.39 B: it it would just be ridiculous if they weren't any minimum wage 

204.61 205.06 A: right 

204.72 208.67 B: and then people just had salaries of like a dollar an hour or something that's just not even worth 

209.03 210.32 A: i know when i 

209.21 210.41 B: you know (( )) 

220.42 220.97 A: will you make 

220.42 220.98 B: oh wow 

225.69 227.78 A: (( )) made to do that but still 

227.97 232.23 A: even back that far it i'm saying had it still haven't come no farther than five dollars 

232.66 236.00 A: something you know something is is like in somewhere 

236.45 238.91 A: somewhere you know and uh 

239.07 242.35 A: i i really think of minimum wage even if you made six 

242.82 253.30 A: that seem a little better because forty hours that's two forty you know but forty hours at five dollars an hour that's like what two hundred and i guess that is better i don't know 

253.34 254.56 B: (( )) it is a little 

254.74 258.56 B: a little bit better i mean actually fifteen cents does make a difference in the long run 

258.29 260.40 A: right right right 

258.96 259.27 B: um 

259.81 265.10 B: i thought that maybe it would be a good a good idea for them to have minimum wage for different types of occupations 

264.81 266.88 A: well then that sounds good 

265.19 266.99 B: varying varying levels of 

267.25 268.22 A: that sounds uh 

267.54 269.36 B: varying levels of minimum wage 

269.48 270.01 A: right 

269.80 270.76 B: for example 

270.86 272.01 B: the minimum wage 

272.52 273.29 B: for 

274.18 275.99 B: i don't know a construction worker 

276.46 280.68 B: should probably be more than the minimum wage for a lifeguard because when i was a lifeguard you know 

280.97 283.42 B: i most of my job was just sitting around you know 

283.21 283.73 A: right 

284.07 284.73 B: um 

285.13 291.68 A: well i think on the construction workers they make good money anyway i don't think they have that i believe those minimum wages for people who 

291.93 293.46 A: like who work in restaurants 

293.93 296.40 A: and hospitals you know the low uh 

294.55 295.10 B: (( )) 

296.62 303.82 A: you know hospital like for the kitchens and cleaning and uh fast food places things like that but when you come to construction workers 

304.30 307.00 A: i don't believe that i don't think so i don't believe that 

306.53 310.56 B: well when you well when you have people uh of my age uh i'm 

310.96 312.20 B: college student um 

312.64 315.32 B: when you have people working construction or 

315.65 318.76 B: some some of my friends worked construction over the summers when i was in high school 

319.05 320.58 B: and they would make minimum wage just because 

320.90 321.21 B: they 

320.94 322.02 A: oh really 

321.35 324.39 B: wouldn't operate any of the well they couldn't operate any of the machinery or anything 

324.12 325.76 A: oh right right 

324.75 325.79 B: they still had to work like 

326.11 326.92 B: really hard 

327.01 327.93 A: right 

327.22 329.72 B: whereas i was just being a lifeguard and you know just 

329.86 330.52 B: you know 

330.94 332.29 B: hang around the pool all day 

332.65 334.98 B: and i was making the same amount of money that they were so 

335.24 335.77 A: oh 

335.40 336.16 B: you know i think that 

336.73 337.31 B: um 

337.95 344.08 B: i think that minimum wage is important but i think that i think that there should be different minimum wages depending on what job you're doing if you're 

344.33 345.57 B: if you're cleaning up or 

345.93 349.58 B: i mean if you're if you're working at a restaurant or something you're obviously going to be working pretty hard 

346.99 347.37 A: mike 

347.51 348.49 A: (( )) 

349.68 350.05 A: mhm 

350.49 358.94 A: that's true that's true you should get more if you're working on uh uh a construction worker should be worke- making more than uh 

359.54 364.84 A: a lifeguard but then you shouldn't play that cheap neither you know that's life in hand you know 

365.21 366.80 A: taken some person life in hand 

365.40 365.87 B: that's true 

367.43 368.00 B: that's true 

368.03 373.38 A: you know are you goi- just (( )) and and that's right you know but that's the way it is sometimes 

373.74 381.94 A: and it should go up i think it should go up they need to go up some i i i don't like that now that's my opinion i i think it should go up some 

374.57 374.95 B: yeah 

382.54 383.30 B: well i don't 

382.64 383.12 A: you know 

383.42 390.21 B: i just don't see why people would propose to raise it fifteen cents at all if they're going to do anything why don't they just propose to raise it fifty cents or twenty five 

395.24 406.90 A: and was it it was at four something and then it's five it's going to go up but has it been up (( )) it went up already are they thinking about it i don't know and you know if you think about this this is something to look into you know what is this 

407.21 409.09 A: thing but you don't think about it when you 

409.34 414.28 A: not making that mu- that amount or you're not working or even if you're working you don't make that amount you know 

414.87 415.65 B: true 

414.88 420.65 A: so i think so but five fifteen (( )) least six seven dollars you know 

421.12 425.42 A: but it but like you said it's small business is the one that have to pay that out you know 

425.81 428.21 A: but uh somebody have to do it i guess 

428.86 429.58 A: mhm 

428.96 429.68 B: well i don't 

429.84 430.48 B: i don't think it's 

431.02 432.47 B: it it if i were an employer 

432.58 433.50 B: i wouldn't even 

434.10 437.07 B: i wouldn't pay any of my employees minimum wage i would at least pay them 

437.49 440.48 B: slightly above minimum wage because to pay someone minimum wage 

438.76 439.23 A: right 

440.76 442.10 B: is kind of like telling them 

442.31 443.75 B: if i could pay you less i would 

443.81 446.10 A: that's right that's right that's right 

444.34 444.81 B: you know 

445.51 445.91 B: so 

446.58 451.46 B: uh i if if i were if i were making five let's say the minimum wage got raised to five fifteen 

451.97 454.30 B: i would appreciate getting at least you know 

454.64 458.99 B: five twenty five as opposed to five fifteen just so that i'll know that i wasn't getting the absolute minimum 

465.36 465.98 A: well (( )) 

466.15 473.76 A: you want seven dollars so i you know you look at the seven dollars but that beat that's better than five fifty five i mean five fifteen you know 

473.64 474.40 B: oh it's definitely 

474.23 475.85 A: but i i do believe 

476.31 480.69 A: that is i believe the reason why they put that minimum wage that mean you can't go below it 

481.54 484.06 A: because most places you go to they do pay more 

484.70 485.54 B: well if you 

484.85 490.63 A: i think so don't you think so uh or you work somewhere that that really has played the mini- paid the minimum wages 

491.00 495.65 B: well i know some people that um got paid less than minimum wage if they were working in a restaurant 

494.65 496.89 A: really oh yes yes 

495.92 496.24 B: well 

496.52 497.62 B: but that's because you 

497.72 500.11 B: you factor in tips as part of the wage 

500.27 500.65 A: yeah 

500.51 503.05 B: so i knew people who were making less than five dollars 

503.51 504.89 B: um waiting tables 

504.84 506.09 A: that's right 

505.19 508.11 B: but would end up coming home with more money than i did because 

508.52 511.69 B: they get tips and then they don't have to pay taxes on tips 

509.27 510.11 A: (( )) 

511.46 512.63 A: right right 

512.31 512.82 B: and 

513.04 513.46 B: you know 

514.04 516.60 A: i was somewhere and this girl i think she was making two 

514.39 514.81 B: so 

516.98 523.94 A: two fifty an hour too and that that was years ago in a restaurant but you getting tips but then if (( )) some people don't leave tips 

524.47 529.05 A: and then you know but you i imagine you do over the period of eight hours you do get something you know 

524.69 525.13 B: oh yeah 

529.43 530.79 A: and that makes up the difference 

529.57 530.46 B: oh definitely 

530.93 533.18 A: you know uh-huh uh-huh but 

532.61 536.59 B: and it and if you're really good and if people who are you know are really friendly and whatever and people 

536.75 537.51 B: tip you well 

537.05 538.63 A: will tip you well 

538.12 539.88 B: end up making even more so it 

539.43 540.08 A: right 

540.40 541.16 A: (( )) 

540.54 544.76 B: i i i actually like that idea of of tipping it's too bad more jobs don't work like that 

548.86 549.93 A: usually if the if 

550.15 560.53 A: you know you have the young mens of ladies takes your bags out and they help you and they tell them not to tip you but you give them something but nowadays they don't have anybody help you take your bags out you take them out on your own you know 

559.38 559.78 B: true 

560.72 562.17 A: everything but
