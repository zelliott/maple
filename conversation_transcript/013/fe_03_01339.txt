42.86 43.97 B: divorce 

44.12 44.96 A: okay

47.81 50.34 B: been together for like for thirty years and 

50.11 51.25 A: yeah 

50.69 51.70 B: um 

51.35 52.25 A: (( the )) 

52.91 55.34 B: [noise] i didn't really have a lot of friends who 

53.25 54.31 A: (( kind of thing to )) 

56.28 57.02 B: like 

57.04 59.45 B: went through a divorce or anything like that 

59.78 65.62 A: but it is actually i mean there are divorces are becoming more common these days i mean 

65.91 67.57 B: yeah i think people 

65.93 66.71 A: (( marriage )) 

67.89 69.89 B: like rush into things 

69.70 70.96 A: mhm 

70.72 72.05 B: too soon 

72.00 72.74 A: (( yes )) 

72.11 80.31 B: and then they decide it's really not for them and end up that's why i think there's more divorce 

75.58 76.89 A: (( mm )) 

81.37 90.63 A: i also think it's [noise] like due to a change in values as well in terms of like it's more okay to have a divorce nowadays than it was say maybe twenty thirty years ago 

90.69 92.35 B: yeah yeah it is 

91.94 97.51 A: [noise] people say [noise] think it's okay now because i guess i don't know maybe because of television and um 

97.71 101.54 A: your still family being not so close as it used to be 

101.50 102.64 B: mhm 

102.58 111.20 A: 'cause maybe twenty five years ago people would i mean they would say they've just stayed together for the sake of the kids and maybe even tolerate a little more than they would nowadays 

111.83 115.82 B: yeah and then there are so many people who are just not getting married 

115.43 118.82 A: mhm yeah that's that's also increasing a lot 

118.48 119.72 B: mhm 

119.78 120.84 B: that might 

120.04 125.03 A: actually in my i come originally from um india where ah 

125.14 131.71 A: it's still not that common to have divorce it's like a pretty big shock if somebody gets divorced but even that's changing nowadays 

131.91 132.93 B: (( uh-uh )) 

132.58 136.66 A: like ten years ago div- divorce was almost unheard of 

136.72 137.74 B: oh 

137.30 139.64 A: but now that's changing as well i guess with 

139.89 141.89 A: television and the internet and people 

141.95 144.88 A: people becoming more like each other in different parts of the world 

145.28 146.49 B: mhm 

147.26 148.76 A: yeah and um 

148.90 150.63 A: i guess it's it's a 

151.47 155.95 A: question of tolerances where people have left other interesting things nowadays i mean 

156.04 158.82 A: a minor thing can just cause people to get a divorce 

160.79 162.35 B: yeah i think so 

163.52 166.00 A: yeah and possibly i don't know 

166.08 167.23 A: may be having 

167.69 169.41 A: closing closer to your 

169.55 172.72 A: (( family might help reduce the rates maybe like i )) 

173.06 175.80 A: guess if your parents set a example then you would 

175.82 177.53 A: follow that i guess 

178.05 181.02 B: yeah then i know people too who are like 

181.05 185.93 B: divorced parents and like they don't want to be like their parents they 

185.42 186.29 A: (( okay okay )) 

186.04 188.03 B: they want to be with someone 

188.56 189.48 B: who they 

188.79 191.41 A: (( um )) 

189.91 191.74 B: plan not to divorce 

192.78 196.21 A: i guess i guess i hopefully nobody plans to get divorced 

195.85 197.32 B: yeah [laughter] 

196.84 198.48 A: it just happens 

198.36 199.31 B: mhm 

198.67 208.62 A: yeah i know um yeah and maybe it's also um a question of just ah working things out sometimes and people you 

209.01 212.23 A: know decide that they don't have the patience to do that any more 

214.64 215.64 B: yeah i think 

215.77 222.87 B: we're kind of like a disposable society if you don't like this thing throw it away and get another one so 

221.97 224.26 A: and try on something else 

224.49 225.32 A: yeah 

225.02 225.81 B: (( yeah )) 

226.87 228.55 B: you know people 

229.23 231.96 B: are so quick to ah make a change 

231.68 232.65 A: (( yes )) 

233.73 234.33 A: (( yes )) 

235.65 237.52 A: (( very much so )) 

237.74 241.81 A: it's not a very it's not a very pleasant circumstance but 

242.74 249.77 A: sometimes i mean sometimes divorce is a better option than suffering and living in living with a lot of tension 

251.47 254.35 A: and some things just don't work out and you have to get out of it 

254.40 256.83 B: mhm especially if there are 

256.96 259.20 B: children involved 

258.59 265.54 A: yeah then it gets messy and i guess it shakes their confidence for having relationships later 

266.00 267.26 A: (( i mean they )) 

267.64 271.34 A: have the fear that it can always end in a break up if they 

271.39 273.72 A: have seen their parents go through the same thing 

274.03 274.85 B: (( mhm )) 

277.04 280.94 A: (( right but me when i haven't had too many friends or )) 

281.45 284.50 A: relatives or people i know who have got divorced but 

284.62 287.95 A: yeah it is a really high end of 

288.38 296.89 A: i've read somewhere that it's likely even higher in europe where they almost half the marriages end in divorces or something like that 

296.55 297.52 B: oh 

297.42 299.08 A: (( which is like really high )) 

301.12 304.29 B: i know i probably know more people whose parents 

304.48 306.23 B: never got married 

306.05 307.03 A: okay 

306.32 308.04 B: in the first place so 

308.68 310.31 B: than yeah 

310.76 312.55 B: divorce never came up 

312.66 313.65 A: okay 

312.79 317.09 B: but still they didn't have you know they didn't live in a two parent household 

317.15 318.03 A: okay 

319.26 327.28 A: i mean yeah but the institution of marriage has less meaning nowadays as in it's okay to live unmarried and 

327.52 328.70 A: (( the )) 

328.85 333.95 A: the olden days that they were living in sin and things like that and that's all okay nowadays so 

334.34 336.76 A: i guess people are waiting longer to get married 

337.12 339.90 B: yeah i think they take it for granted 

340.27 341.21 A: mhm 

340.71 343.94 B: like what it [noise] really is supposed to be about 

344.27 344.96 A: (( yes )) 

347.31 348.83 A: mhm 

352.12 355.23 B: people shouldn't rush into it 

355.46 356.53 A: (( mhm yes )) 

357.43 359.46 A: (( take their time and get to know the person )) 

364.27 365.47 B: (( otherwise )) 

365.84 367.05 A: mhm 

367.04 367.84 B: (( um )) 

372.16 374.60 B: it doesn't seem like i don't think that 

376.00 378.06 B: so many people like 

378.42 385.07 B: as far as like this new generation of children who are like have divorced parents are going to be like 

385.78 387.79 B: any worse off than 

388.15 389.11 A: okay 

389.21 396.61 B: other kids and most of the time in two parent families but their their lifestyle would be a little different 

390.68 391.53 A: okay 

396.77 398.04 A: mhm 

397.45 399.95 B: but you know most of the time 

400.56 401.64 B: they're just 

401.73 405.75 A: yeah might i say even make them a little more independent not having 

405.16 406.31 B: mhm 

406.20 409.41 A: people to look after them i mean not having two parents so it 

409.65 411.29 A: might make them a little more 

411.66 413.28 A: i mean they can 

413.37 415.33 A: (( fend for themselves maybe )) 

416.19 421.32 A: but it is hard sometimes and i guess being a single parent is really hard 

427.65 431.83 B: do you know how long um these conversations are supposed to be 

431.96 434.83 A: i'm not exactly sure actually 

434.31 435.14 B: (( oh )) 

435.17 436.74 B: (( this is my first time )) 

435.55 436.67 A: (( maybe )) 

436.90 438.90 A: yeah mine too [laughter] 

439.41 444.88 A: yeah i don't know maybe when we are done discussing it we just stop i guess i don't know
