37.97 39.03 B: um 

38.03 39.27 A: what what 

39.89 44.37 B: i'm i'm very liberal so i'm not in favor of any kind of censorship 

44.79 46.52 B: um i think that 

46.62 52.95 B: just banning books will will foster people's um attention and then it will just have the opposite effect 

53.21 56.65 B: so they'll make people more interested in that which they can't have 

58.02 59.06 A: well i don't 

58.13 59.19 B: (( what do you think )) 

59.23 66.00 A: i don't know if i'm liberal or not but i i i don't think that people should be able to 

66.79 69.20 A: to not 

69.24 72.80 A: ah be allowed to read what they'd like to read 

74.05 75.01 B: right 

74.40 78.78 A: i i don't understand why even now there are some books that are 

78.86 79.90 A: (( that are a- [mn] )) 

81.31 88.39 A: that are not allowed ah to be read in you know certain grades or whatever and and i'm not sure i understand that 

88.78 92.54 A: you said being liberal you think that allows 

92.73 99.53 A: or that that because you are that means that you don't think there should be any censorship at all 

99.92 101.68 B: well um 

102.42 112.06 B: n- for the most part i mean i i believe that you know the first amendment was created to so that we would be able to read what we like and to have access to any kind of material that we would like 

111.97 126.64 B: um and to be able to say what we want read what we want i think that's basically the essence of the first amendment and um i mean i i understand how some literature could be considered harmful to people who are especially at a young age where they're more impressionable 

126.51 128.16 A: (( [mn] well what [mn] )) 

126.68 127.87 B: but um [noise] 

128.60 130.22 A: what about ah 

131.05 141.90 A: getting off of books for just a second what about movies and things like that do you think they should be allowed to be seen by a- i mean a a age appropriate is what i'm getting at but ah 

140.90 141.90 B: mhm 

142.04 143.76 A: do you think that's okay 

142.49 143.36 B: um 

144.27 153.43 B: well i think that it it's good that they're that um you know that guidance is is encouraged i mean if you if you're under the age of 

153.56 168.25 B: um thirteen you know you shouldn't you should be able to see a p._g. thirteen movie but with the supervision of somebody else you know i don't think that necessarily you should have access to any any rated movie at any age you know 

168.05 172.72 A: [noise] [noise] let me ask you have you seen or ever heard of the move the song of the south 

172.94 174.35 B: oh what's it called 

174.52 181.93 A: song of the south it's an old cartoon type movie with ah the song zippedy dooh dah came from 

182.01 184.02 B: (( no i don't think i've ever heard of )) 

183.63 184.56 A: oh 

185.02 185.74 B: (( that )) 

185.07 194.58 A: well that's too bad [laughter] because i wanted [laughter] what well all right let's took about the a book of mice and men have you have you read that [mn] 

186.39 187.71 B: [laughter] 

192.73 193.83 B: right yeah 

194.32 196.37 B: (( yes i have )) 

195.89 198.77 A: what why do you think that's banned some places 

199.43 208.95 B: um i wasn't aware that it was banned i know books like um huckleberry finn or you know mark ah you know books by mark twain have been banned before um i think 

207.87 209.15 A: (( w- why )) 

209.58 216.64 B: i think it's just because some of the ideas presented at the time were very controversial and um you know they might 

217.21 221.16 B: i guess some of the ideas are maybe a little bit too too liberal for 

221.55 225.11 B: places i guess especially in the south like the idea of um 

225.53 229.64 B: you know a of black people having any kind of um 

229.78 230.92 B: (( any rights )) 

231.44 233.36 B: of their culture at the time 

233.46 235.57 B: so because they didn't want 

234.63 235.78 A: so do you think it was 

236.40 239.90 A: so you think it was all right to have them banned 

239.02 246.09 B: no i i don't but i'm just trying to ah you know offer a reason as to why they might have been banned at the time i don't agree with them being banned at all 

246.45 254.98 A: oh good because i don't i don't you know i'm i'm a big mark twain fan actually i've been through hannibal quite a few times and and i 

255.34 257.61 A: i just don't understand why 

258.68 263.53 A: it sounds li- it sounds like politically correctness to me political correctness 

262.66 273.90 B: yeah definitely i think people are just kind of scared also if anything challenges their belief system if you live in a stable community where everybody kind of things the same anything that might change that is a threat you know 

274.35 281.81 B: so um that would be an unwelcome kind of thing if you're happy with your current situation you you wouldn't welcome any kind of change 

282.60 287.32 A: yeah but i i don't know that i agree with that i think changes are at least 

287.33 289.40 A: (( a the )) 

289.43 292.98 A: the accessibility to change should should be 

293.13 295.70 A: looked at positively by everybody 

295.40 301.39 B: i agree i mean i think change is very healthy and i think that to be settled into one kind of mindset is very 

301.57 315.16 B: you know it's in a way um you know people are kind of ignorant if they're so narrow minded so i think that change is good and um you know they should welcome any kind of different viewpoint but unfortunately a lot of people um 

315.19 317.08 B: don't have that kind of mindset 

317.18 318.12 B: you know 

318.27 319.47 A: well you know 

318.44 322.68 B: anybody who thinks differently than they do um they just want to get rid of or ssilence 

322.93 331.49 A: i find it interesting that you began by by saying that you were a liberal and and this way and and i don't think of myself as a liberal but i 

331.56 343.43 A: am listening to you and and talking to you and you to me and and it seems like we both [laughter] agree on a lot of things and yet we say we're the opposite so maybe that's good 

338.73 339.69 B: right 

342.39 344.34 B: well do you think that you're a conservative 

344.62 349.22 A: no i don't know that i'm a conservative so much as that i i i don't 

350.32 353.98 A: [sigh] i don't know i i i i'm i guess i l- 

355.31 368.62 A: look at what people call a u- would you consider yourself on the left then well quote i hate terms but i [mn] that's what liberals seems to claim to be on the left is that how you'd look at yourself 

368.81 378.36 B: yeah i mean i i don't think i'm unreasonably to the left i'm not an extremist but um i do agree with a lot of the you know left wing agendas i always vote to democratic 

378.41 379.48 B: so um 

379.06 384.21 A: well now see now now see that that's where i think i have a problem about vote wh- why 

384.28 390.21 A: when you say you always vote democratic i i'm a registered independent and i have been for a while and but i vote for i [mn] 

390.34 398.07 A: always think that i should vote for the person not because they're republican or democrat but because the majority of what they 

398.73 408.00 A: think is the way i think [mn] even though if some of them some things aren't that you i i've never found anybody that agreed everything the way i thought it should be 

407.64 413.67 B: well that's the way i mean i don't think you can find somebody who will see eye to eye on every single issue that you know 

413.96 415.97 B: that you do but um i 

414.38 415.06 A: [noise] 

415.97 423.95 B: mean i usually i do look at the person you know i i i have certain issues that i feel most strongly about and as long as the person 

423.94 438.68 B: you know um would vote the same way that i would on ah those those main issues then i would i would vote for them and in most in most cases the democrat candidate usually does you know they're in support of what i'm support of 

438.38 445.21 A: well what if one person had everything that you liked about him but he didn't want 

445.44 449.20 A: certain books read in in the classroom 

449.87 452.79 A: would that still be okay to vote for him then 

453.43 460.48 B: well um i mean would it be his personal opinion or would it be something that he would try to make into law you know 

458.51 459.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

459.35 461.28 A: something that he would try to do 

461.55 473.84 B: well i don't know if i could support him then you know because first of all i i don't i kind of think that would inconsistent like if he if he agreed with everything else that i agreed with then i think that that that would be a little inconsistent with his other views 

473.94 474.99 B: (( you know [noise] )) 

474.51 479.84 A: [noise] well i i i'm not i don't know about that i 

480.03 482.43 A: (( ah hm )) 

483.09 487.67 A: my daughter i- i- is is is a catholic 

487.86 489.76 A: but yet she 

489.72 490.29 B: (( [noise] )) 

490.14 491.91 A: isn't 

491.93 494.10 A: she is more 

494.62 496.08 A: pro 

496.61 499.91 A: life than pro i mean pro choice than pro life 

499.81 500.74 B: uh-huh 

501.57 503.05 A: do you think that's 

503.86 508.80 A: i mean so i and so i think people can be directed in one in one 

510.08 516.04 A: direction and and still ah have certain things that they are vehemently opposed to 

516.48 523.55 B: really well i think a lot of factors go into it i mean maybe just the fact that she's a female could play a large part in her decision about abortion 

523.62 525.04 B: you know um 

525.26 527.24 B: not necessarily just because 

527.32 532.99 B: you know of your religion you're going to think you know the same way as most people in that religion 

533.36 534.37 B: you know 

534.39 537.00 B: um i think a lot of factors go into um 

537.69 539.44 B: like a lot of factors influence 

539.60 542.45 B: the way you think about different things you know 

542.91 550.37 B: um [noise] i'm jewish so i would support somebody who who would be a jewish candidate probably i wouldn't support anybody who 

544.50 545.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

550.47 554.85 B: you know is um anti semitic definitely like that's that's very important to me 

556.69 562.06 A: how how do you feel about the current ah war situation i mean put it that way 

562.67 567.88 B: um well you know i i try not to involve myself too much in um 

568.57 574.65 B: in in political affairs and i try not to read the newspaper i try not to watch t._v. because i find it very depressing 

574.76 580.95 B: you know i i don't i mean i i feel that saddam hussein is is a very evil person and what he's done 

578.11 578.77 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

580.92 587.97 B: to his people is just atrocious and i do believe you know that something should be done about that i just don't know if we've necessarily 

587.85 599.86 B: tried you know alternate means aside besides war you know i don't know if we've necessarily explored all the different alternatives then again i i really don't know i haven't [noise] you know i've purposely tried not to know
