47.53 51.37 A: on the book banning i believe that 

51.92 56.22 A: i i i i believe that it's a 

56.81 60.54 A: good thing i believe the schools 

60.56 66.15 A: sometimes we force our schools sometimes to act in loco parentis 

66.79 68.85 A: for the parents 

69.02 78.64 A: and not everything needs to be exposed to the individual at at one time you get you show a little 

79.69 84.20 A: you show a little knowledge in some areas you whet that knowledge 

84.36 88.80 A: and you continue to 

89.79 96.86 A: if you plant the seeds of knowledge in one area it will grow there and from those seeds 

98.48 101.54 A: will sprout other ideas in other areas 

103.13 109.07 B: okay but so you feel that it it is okay to ban books from the school systems 

110.02 114.18 A: i believe if the if the parents won't do it 

114.26 118.18 A: the school somebody has to do it 

117.63 130.03 B: okay the thing is though i i could see pornographic material but in the past there have been sections of the country even harry potter books that people think for some reason are evil 

130.02 133.77 B: and are actually innocent ah books 

133.87 135.45 B: (( that ah )) 

135.49 143.53 B: people want to ban them and they've been a lot of classics that have been banned because for some reason people 

143.63 152.04 B: were against them for outlandish reasons and they ended up being classics and on the best seller lists and and 

152.36 161.95 B: people could learn from them so i myself feel that unless it's proven to be pornographic material which we wouldn't any child to be exposed to 

162.24 165.09 B: i don't think any any book should really be 

165.64 168.33 B: other than that should be outlawed 

167.79 170.66 A: [mn] i'll throw a couple of curves your way 

170.24 171.25 B: okay 

170.84 174.58 A: the anarchist's cook book for one 

175.77 186.35 A: books which were written by say abbey hoffman and jerry rubin in the seventies soul on ice by eldridge cleaver 

182.40 183.82 B: mhm 

185.97 187.12 B: right 

188.24 196.04 A: there is no there is no reason why in my mind why a school would want to 

197.53 201.10 A: use these in a school by 

201.21 204.21 A: definitions of school meaning 

204.35 208.38 A: ah grammar middle to even 

208.40 210.96 A: i would say sophomore in high school 

211.44 218.17 A: to use any of these books however if people wish to read them on their own 

218.76 222.54 A: they're more than more more than free to do so 

223.61 225.83 A: do you see where i'm coming from 

225.26 233.59 B: um i could see your point in a way but if they had a school library maybe they weren't near a public library 

234.05 235.10 B: um 

234.89 243.26 B: i don't know i mean maybe they wouldn't have any other chance to get the books i haven't read them i kinda know what their philosophy is 

243.06 250.58 B: and i don't think that if someone reads a book about a certain topic that that would ah change that person 

251.38 260.01 B: into an anarchist just like i don't think if you re- read a book about a drug addict you're going to become a drug addict or a murderer 

260.40 264.79 B: i i don't believe that just like if i were to see a film on such 

264.82 268.17 B: i wouldn't be influenced by that to go out and 

268.76 270.20 B: murder someone 

270.60 272.88 A: yes but do we have to 

273.44 284.42 A: make it mandated that people young people should have to be exposed to this at an at an early age 

284.29 285.89 B: how about high school 

286.57 289.82 A: again i will use the reference of 

290.69 292.76 A: past the sophomore year 

293.70 298.30 B: i think um usually you're fifteen in sophomore year 

298.97 300.77 B: that by that point 

301.09 302.32 B: (( you're )) 

302.69 309.01 B: you should be mature enough and indi- individual to be able to think for yourself and make your own decisions 

308.61 310.89 A: oh dear lady i don't know 

311.40 314.27 A: what neighbourhood you live in or 

314.61 320.39 A: where you what your background is but i most heartily disagree 

320.42 333.38 A: i have met fifteen year olds i have met twenty year olds who can't walk and chew gum at the same time maturity isn't defined by a number maturity is 

333.45 337.07 A: defined by the person themselves 

337.65 341.38 B: sure i mean there's people out there that are fifty 

341.45 342.78 B: forty 

343.40 346.68 B: twenty one that are immature 

346.83 355.05 B: and there are some fifteen year olds that are mature as well and they are still children under eighteen they are still children 

355.28 365.51 B: and as i said before i wouldn't want to expose them to any pornographic material but i don't think that banning books like who's going to make the decision 

366.23 367.91 B: to ban the books 

367.30 371.19 A: the parent that's why we have parents 

370.95 378.39 B: so the harry potter books could be banned because the parents think that it's a witchcraft book 

378.80 381.58 A: (( well eventually )) 

381.78 385.68 A: eventually if someone wishes to read a book 

386.25 391.95 A: long enough they'll find a way to read a book i can only use my experience 

392.01 394.97 A: as a point of reference in this 

395.40 398.00 A: i came from a background which 

399.84 401.16 A: although 

401.42 404.37 A: although i was a hippie way back 

404.74 409.10 A: way back in the day if you'll excuse the expression 

406.66 407.83 B: [laughter] 

409.63 412.42 A: (( that )) 

412.82 426.39 A: my parents weren't happy when i brought home jerry rubin's or abbey hoffman's do it or eldridge or that i wanted to read eldridge cleaver soul on ice 

426.10 427.54 B: did you read them 

427.10 428.37 A: yes i did 

428.07 430.08 B: and your parents allowed it 

430.25 435.73 A: they they weren't happy but it was with my money with which i bought these books

437.62 438.79 A: oh no 

439.89 442.74 A: (( no no no no i was )) 

444.87 451.58 A: oh gosh i wish i had a point of reference i'll give you a point of reference for my age i'm forty eight right now 

451.22 452.32 B: okay 

452.20 457.98 A: ah i read them during my high school 

458.90 463.27 A: during my high school year i guess about 

462.70 464.83 B: so it's about thirty two years ago 

463.77 466.01 A: i guess about sophomore 

466.07 471.39 A: sophomore so as when i turned into a hippie for lack of a better term 

471.42 473.15 B: well i guess like a rebel 

473.28 474.53 B: for the time 

475.35 479.14 A: it's i i'm ancient what can i say 

478.81 488.14 B: ah i wouldn't say that it's a number but i'd say every teenage year has a rebellious 

488.42 493.72 B: whatever age they grow up there's some way to rebel like in the past 

491.62 492.79 A: oh yes
