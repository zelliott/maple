1.37 3.18 A: hi this is sharon 

2.81 4.08 B: hi sharon 

3.75 4.96 A: how are you 

4.58 9.67 B: good this is strange uh this is the second call this evening i'm doing [laughter] 

8.65 11.61 A: i know me too it's very weird 

9.78 18.87 B: is that right and it's the same topic oh well that's fine this'll be the third call so then i'll get a check too [laughter] i guess so 

12.41 13.56 A: yes 

16.48 18.27 A: (( oh that's good )) 

19.59 21.86 A: (( uh s- so what do you think )) 

19.60 20.91 B: well 

21.28 23.92 B: well i think um that 

24.01 32.72 B: the schools need to be real careful uh what they let the kids uh read uh my daughter when she was in about third grade [lipsmack] 

32.91 41.05 B: was reading a book it seemed harm- harmless enough until i started reading it about a dog who lived on a farm who killed a chicken or something 

40.73 41.94 A: mhm 

41.30 48.86 B: but the words in the book were uh they were words like uh murder bloody murder which the dog would say 

48.97 52.28 B: and blood everywhere and and talking about killing 

52.32 60.03 B: now it's all fic- you know fictitional characters but still to a young child that can leave an impact 

59.80 74.20 B: and even g- give 'em nightmares and i tried to get that book removed from the school and nobody listens you know and and uh i mean the kids a lot of kids uh go home to to no parents there these days you know 

61.67 62.61 A: right 

73.40 74.70 A: mhm 

74.04 82.59 B: well that's the last thing they need to be reading is murder and killing you know there's a lot of other things they can read like how a little kid helped a poor man or something you know 

76.97 78.26 A: right 

82.30 83.51 A: sure 

82.92 83.75 B: mhm 

84.39 90.71 A: no i know you know it's just so funny because it's such a fine line 

91.54 99.08 A: i i think like i don't believe in censorship i believe that people can do and believe and r- read what they want to 

94.59 95.46 B: uh-huh 

99.69 105.08 A: but is it really ce- but i don't think it's really censorship if it's like something like in your instance 

104.43 105.24 B: mhm 

105.14 109.31 A: like i feel that you have a right as a parent 

109.57 113.43 A: to stop this you know your child from reading this book 

113.07 119.84 B: right but but my complaining and trying to get it off the shelves had i succeeded would that have been censorship 

118.43 125.72 A: only h- h- hold on a minute russ get the door i think they're here i'm sorry i'm sorry go ahead 

125.04 131.00 B: would would if if i had succeeded on getting the book off the shelves would that have been considered censorship you know 

131.47 138.44 A: [sigh] well i i don't really consider that censorship i i i consider that like a concerned parent [laughter] 

137.13 139.15 B: mhm yeah 

138.87 147.52 A: but i like it if if if like i feel like it's the mayor or the town or the government of a town has you know has a list of books that the kids can't read 

146.85 148.36 B: right 

148.04 154.57 A: for political reasons or you know like w- the last person i was talking to we were talking about like huck finn 

154.45 155.64 B: (( yeah )) 

155.03 157.51 A: like huck finn to me 

157.68 158.57 A: i mean 

158.62 161.84 A: i don't think a child should read it but a high school student can 

161.51 162.63 B: right 

162.00 163.47 A: you know what i mean 

162.71 173.18 B: yeah because at that age when they're younger they're a little more uh it's easier to influence their minds you know but uh when they're older they can make their own decisions 

169.30 170.85 A: (( [sigh] yes )) 

172.74 173.68 A: right 

173.33 174.67 B: and uh 

174.87 181.67 B: but you know for instance teachers could lose their jobs over letting students read certain types of literature 

181.36 182.44 A: yes 

181.89 183.26 B: um 

183.75 187.45 B: that's kind of a touchy subject there you know 

185.62 186.40 A: (( yeah )) 

186.64 191.46 A: right no i i i i've no no no i know it's it's it's it's a very 

191.66 199.39 A: sticky situation 'cause like if you really think about what censorship is like in all the i think it has a lot of different definitions 

199.31 204.01 B: yeah right and that's right and who decides it 

200.79 201.60 A: you 

203.33 210.34 A: right that's my whole thing you know uh that that's like it's a very weird thing to me 

204.07 205.37 B: yeah 

205.61 206.76 B: right 

209.84 210.82 B: mhm 

210.60 215.94 A: to say that and you know and part of the other question that we gotta talk about was like private or public schools 

215.53 225.96 B: yeah well i don't know how different it is i sent my daughter to um [lipsmack] a private school for a few years and she goes to public school for the first time this year 

216.42 217.58 A: [sigh] 

225.60 226.63 A: mhm 

226.09 232.45 B: but um i didn't uh i don't think i saw any difference really 

232.52 235.13 B: in the two censoring anything 

235.54 243.06 A: do you think that d- do you feel like private you don't feel like the private school can censor more than a public school or vice versa 

241.70 248.13 B: you know what i bet they could i'll bet they could uh i just don't believe that i saw it done 

248.46 253.50 B: in fact you know my experiences with private school uh were wonderful um 

253.97 255.26 B: you know when i 

255.40 265.22 B: if i had a problem if there was way too much homework or whatnot it was taken care of immediately whereas the public schools always blew off my concerns as if it didn't matter you know 

263.11 264.01 A: hm 

265.04 266.50 A: that's interesting 

266.01 274.95 B: yeah it it was it was uh no her private school was was very small she had in her class you know there was one 

275.00 281.48 B: um grader one class for each grade level so it was very a small school which may have made a difference as well 

277.91 278.95 A: mhm 

281.19 282.07 A: right 

282.00 283.24 B: so i don't know 

283.65 291.88 A: right you know y- you just don't know like i don't know my kids go to a public school and um 

286.61 288.65 B: yeah 

290.00 290.85 B: uh-huh 

292.43 296.08 A: i think you know from what they've read it's been okay 

296.15 304.82 A: but i can tell you like in third grade my daughter read roald dahl books like that's like matilda and the charlie and the chocolate factory and 

303.80 304.71 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

305.19 312.23 A: and he's kind of very odd and and h- a lot of his books are very anti adults and [laughter] very anti parents 

310.84 314.18 B: mhm now which and which was that 

313.60 319.00 A: road dahl so like matilda do you know they also have a video of matilda 

316.41 318.08 B: uh-huh yeah 

318.82 321.43 B: i think my daughter has that book actually 

320.83 321.98 A: yes 

322.11 327.52 A: and it's 'cause [mn] they had the twits and j- james and the giant peach 

328.38 335.57 A: and it's just very interesting because um reading that in third grade i mean the kids think it's all in fun 

335.16 336.28 B: mhm 

335.59 337.92 A: but it's like as an adult reading the book 

338.39 344.05 A: they really make parents and adults be out to be horrible [laughter] 

341.48 345.27 B: oh really [laughter] well i think maybe i'd better read that 

344.63 349.13 A: [laughter] yeah i mean it it's just funny because you don't 

349.32 360.67 A: like i wouldn't censor them from reading it because it made them wanna read it like like that's ch- the k- it made the kids wanna read more and more of these books so how can you stop them 

352.61 354.01 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

360.26 361.47 B: i know 

361.79 369.82 A: so to censor because they're against adults or against parents is really kinda hard to me because it's encouraging them to read 

367.35 368.46 B: yeah 

369.19 371.14 B: right right that's right 

371.18 375.95 A: so you know it's i i find it very interesting like i don't know 

374.67 376.98 B: yeah um 

377.56 383.92 B: well you know like the the other lady i was talking to was talking about for instance national geographic 

383.30 384.50 A: mhm 

383.93 389.37 B: i don't think i really want my daughter seeing that you know i remember the first time i saw it you know [laughter] 

388.81 389.98 A: right 

389.33 399.50 B: and i was in shock and and of course um our sex education and health class i wanna make sure they'd they'd better ask me for my permission before they teach that to her you know 

399.27 406.30 A: right but do you right but do you feel they should i mean would you want someone in telling you that you c- they can't 

399.58 400.53 B: uh 

406.72 415.66 B: um that they can't teach it uh no i think the parents should be given the choice if they want someone to teach it or if or if we should teach it to them 

408.83 409.80 A: teach it 

415.07 416.36 A: (( r- right )) 

415.72 424.15 B: and if for instance i don't want her to learn it in school from her her grouchy old you know ninety year old health teacher who doesn't really care that much 

423.84 424.78 A: right 

424.17 427.49 B: uh she'll be put in another classroom for that time 

427.30 428.38 A: right 

427.83 437.09 B: and like i said right now she's learning about um anorexia and bulimia which i wish i would've been to me that's almost teaching them how to do certain things 

436.48 437.68 A: mhm 

437.10 439.10 B: you know it's kinda worries them 

439.37 440.00 A: (( oh )) 

439.38 445.43 B: uh they there are certain things i think they should ask us if if we want our kids to learn that from someone else 

444.80 447.35 A: r- right and th- they don't do that 

446.95 447.87 B: no 

448.38 449.78 B: (( and i think )) 

448.74 454.45 A: right i i i think like there was t- i think like guidelines should be sent home to the parents i agree 

453.87 459.31 B: yeah i mean they they send them home if you're gonna let your kid go on the internet you know you have to have permission to 

454.55 455.72 A: [sigh] 

458.66 459.70 A: right 

459.32 466.31 B: to let them go on the internet at school but then other things are just assumed it's okay when sometimes it may not be 

466.29 470.81 A: right like i i f- but see but i don't call that censorship 

466.44 467.42 B: (( you know )) 

470.86 471.97 B: right 

470.95 473.03 A: do you call that censorship 

472.38 473.99 B: no i don't 

473.97 480.03 A: i i i'd i'd call that a concerned parent [laughter] 

474.17 475.24 B: uh 

476.95 478.28 B: yeah 

478.79 484.25 B: yeah i don't call it censorship uh i mean if 

484.31 487.64 B: if the school was uh refusing 

487.71 489.01 B: to 

489.23 493.14 B: teach it that would be censors- censorship you know 

492.32 494.79 A: right right 

493.31 494.43 B: um 

494.84 502.27 A: or if someone else said they can't learn this ye- y- y- yes but i th- i think a lot of it's up to the parents 

498.03 499.30 B: right 

501.70 503.28 B: mhm 

503.10 511.73 A: i think you know i think you're right i think you know if this subject was being taught in school you should've you should be made 

512.27 517.16 A: aware of it first and to see what the curriculum is 

513.33 514.98 B: mhm right 

516.78 517.95 B: definitely 

517.80 523.94 A: like i know in our school in the fourth and fifth grade they teach you know uh fourth grade is puberty [lipsmack] 

523.68 524.58 B: uh-huh 

524.26 526.02 A: and they send home 

526.24 537.78 A: um guidelines of what they're gonna teach and then they have a meeting before with the parents to discuss what they're gonna teach and then you have the option before and after whether you want your kid to learn it in school 

530.71 531.87 B: oh 

532.80 533.84 B: uh-huh 

537.08 538.53 B: oh 

538.56 540.09 B: that's interesting 

539.38 541.06 A: and i think that's a good thing 

540.66 542.01 B: i do too 

541.73 551.00 A: i think that's a really good thing because it's getting the parents involved and it's giving a parent t- the right to say yes or no and i don't think that's censorship 

543.55 544.82 B: right 

548.76 549.73 B: yeah 

550.61 552.40 B: no no 

552.47 555.78 B: uh i mean you know if if they 

555.80 564.22 B: but almost in a way like all of this war thing and everything could also in a way be censorship i mean we're only we're only really getting a certain view 

564.25 571.82 B: of what's going on you know we're not getting the view from from some of the other uh t._v. 

565.49 566.68 A: mhm 

571.92 576.61 B: stations or whatever uh we're only getting a view of what our government wants us to see 

576.19 577.40 A: mhm 

576.74 579.93 B: so in a way that could be censorship 

579.76 581.62 A: oh yeah absolutely 

580.98 581.96 B: you know 

581.79 582.81 A: yes 

582.00 587.03 B: because i i go on this the arab news website which is an english arab uh 

587.62 599.89 B: en- english arab newspaper on the internet and it's really interesting to see their views you know i mean and they let the american people or people from all over the other uh all over the world speak their minds 

590.16 591.23 A: mhm 

593.61 594.58 A: right
