1.09 2.17 B: hello 

3.32 5.14 B: hi i'm lindsay wiltshire 

5.62 6.56 A: i'm sorry 

6.62 8.86 B: i'm sorry i said i'm lindsay what's your name 

8.53 9.79 A: i'm deborah 

9.63 10.97 B: deborah hi 

10.60 13.39 A: [laughter] don't you love these calls 

13.79 15.55 B: i know they're funny 

15.60 17.76 B: um what do you think 

18.18 20.18 A: whether or not public schools should 

20.40 23.16 A: [noise] i didn't catch the last of it was it 

22.58 26.54 B: oh i i think they said do you think that public schools should um 

26.58 28.71 B: allow um books 

29.26 36.49 B: allow cer- allow books to be read like all books or do you think they should be able to ban certain books public and private schools 

34.63 35.68 A: i think they should 

36.08 38.55 A: i think they should be able to restrict 

39.33 41.83 B: yeah that's kind of how i felt [noise] 

41.61 45.24 A: i mean banning is a bit too ridiculous unless it's 

46.00 47.84 A: so outrageous it could 

47.90 48.91 A: um 

50.19 53.82 A: [lipsmack] and be an adverse effect on the students 

52.66 53.66 B: mhm 

54.22 57.38 A: um there are a lot of things that aren't age appropriate 

58.37 63.92 B: mm i think it depends on the age and and the level of of the student and the maturity 

63.40 64.67 A: exactly 

64.20 67.28 B: of them but yeah i agree with 

68.83 77.93 B: well [sigh] i don't even know if restricted is the right word of course so far as back to you you know as a parent you should be able to 

78.23 85.95 B: kind of have more of a say in what your kids should read and what they shouldn't read now i think required reading is a completely different story but 

86.06 88.33 B: (( you know as far as )) 

88.82 92.08 B: banned books i really have a problem with 

92.61 97.37 B: people really banning them because there really it seems like it just really shouldn't be an issue if the parents 

97.42 99.03 B: and other people 

99.53 102.83 B: you know kind of did their jobs then it wouldn't be a problem 

103.21 106.13 A: true but um 

106.30 111.92 A: like is it like [mn] banning is i don't think the answer to anything but a parent should have the 

112.45 114.40 A: option to 

114.66 118.04 A: opt out their student if they have any objections 

116.28 117.31 B: yeah 

118.03 120.75 B: oh definitely definitely i feel that way 

120.26 121.52 A: and have something 

121.60 123.56 A: alternate available 

123.37 124.45 B: mhm 

123.81 127.31 A: i i think what what brought to mind um 

127.47 130.18 A: the sort of question was some schools 

130.21 134.46 A: the parents in them tying to attempt to ban the harry potter books 

135.44 137.29 B: yeah um 

137.42 140.24 B: i have a you know but some people think 

140.61 142.29 B: (( i don't know )) 

143.61 144.64 B: it 

147.51 156.07 B: just seems like that would it seems so extreme to me but at the same time i mean people have a right to their opinion and if they don't want their kids again 

156.08 161.58 B: you know if you have if there's a book that's offensive to you for any you know and your parents can say this is offensive 

161.74 169.20 B: you know i don't want my child reading this can you please read something else you know that seems you know appropriate but mhm 

168.46 176.50 A: right uh i think my kids are all out of school now but when my youngest was in high school just a few years ago 

176.50 183.98 A: uh they sent home permission slips for the kids to watch an r. rated movie in school 

184.14 185.60 B: (( and how old were they )) 

185.56 188.35 A: an r. rated movie and i said no 

189.57 193.00 B: how old how old were the kids whenever they were given this permission 

192.41 193.99 A: juniors in high school 

194.36 195.98 B: juniors in high school 

195.53 197.02 A: right but 

196.02 200.89 B: yeah still if it's not appropriate for the m._p._a._a. you shouldn't be showing it in school 

200.58 203.25 A: exactly exactly so 

203.60 206.52 A: um but others i mean there's been 

206.56 211.35 A: big deals over all kinds of books some that don't really seem that 

211.89 213.98 A: terribly inappropriate 

214.57 217.92 B: oh yeah i mean same here well even 

219.39 221.41 B: school and um 

221.79 224.59 B: they whenever i was in high school they would 

224.94 227.88 B: offer they would have times where they would let you read 

228.22 241.42 B: not necessarily a banned book but you could pick the books that you wanted to read that weren't on the normal reading list and um you know even if they were you know like catcher in the rye or something like that books that are you know generally not 

233.02 233.83 A: (( ahah )) 

241.61 252.17 B: they they won't make they're not school sponsored readings but at the same time they're good books that happen to have some different you know content to it that is considered inappropriate for some 

252.06 253.56 A: for some mhm 

252.36 261.47 B: and it was kind of nice that they kind of gave us everybody an out that way so that if they wanted to read it they could they could kind of explore they could do what they wanted to do with it 

261.85 263.36 A: well that's more appropriate 

261.85 274.06 B: and that was nice and of course you know this is when i was a senior in high school and you know catcher in the rye was nothing compared to some of the other things that were out there so 

274.25 275.08 B: it was 

275.36 279.12 B: i really liked it i really liked it that they did that at the time because it 

279.82 283.48 B: you know at the same time once you get to that age it seems like you're either 

283.90 287.81 B: going to think like an adult or you're going to think like a child and 

288.26 293.45 B: [sigh] i don't know it just i have a hard time i'm sorry 

291.25 292.66 A: well they were books
