263.39 264.49 A: oh yeah 

267.35 278.84 B: pet stores selling bunnies now and i've got lots of strong opinions on the subject of rabbits you know because there's a lot of in- misinformation out out there about them and um yeah and it's 

276.90 281.90 A: really as far as domesticated rabbits or r- oh okay 

280.01 290.10 B: yeah right right [sigh] and so you know it's sort of treated casually and um you know those of us who are devoted to them 

290.15 291.22 A: [laughter] 

290.53 294.49 B: (( [laughter] oh my god you know um )) 

295.81 305.48 B: so but um yeah so they they eat up a lot a lot of time too actually they re- require quite a bit of care i find oh

307.15 317.21 B: i do i do i do they're really really sweet really funny they've got nice little personalities they're all [laughter] you know 

311.28 312.12 A: huh

317.32 321.93 A: do they do you keep them together same cage or separately 

321.66 334.91 B: in in the past i've always been able to we call it bond them um they b- bunnies are form very close attachments with each other which is one of the sweet things about them 'cause they're like 

326.11 327.16 A: uh-huh 

333.55 334.64 A: i see [noise] 

335.00 340.82 B: show their affection for each other all the time and they lie together and they groom each other and

345.54 346.46 A: huh 

347.03 349.61 B: which is not typical of animals you know 

349.16 361.24 A: [noise] yeah if i if any if any animal could do it though i think it would be rabbits they're they seem i don't know in general pretty cuddly and pretty easy going it seems like they'd be able to make friends i don't know 

349.93 350.98 B: um 

361.42 363.27 B: [laughter] there's another 

361.46 366.32 A: but wild animals are are wild animals maybe that's just a misconception i have 

365.63 374.71 B: yeah well of course they're not they're not they're not wild they're actually a different species than the wild uh bunnies um [sigh] 

371.75 372.76 A: okay 

375.78 384.93 B: but um actually they can be very very fierce and they will fight to the often fight to the death when they fight yeah so 

383.04 384.02 A: really 

384.80 394.16 B: and they will they're also much fiercer than most people think you know i mean people yeah some people are like afraid of getting getting bitten with 

389.26 390.40 A: yeah 

394.07 395.04 A: (( [laughter] ))

438.92 440.38 A: oh really 

439.77 451.36 B: yeah 'cause they have like these slightly bulging eyes that look all around they can look up you know to watch out for the hawks and stuff that are coming down to get them and they can look in front and back and sides [sigh]
