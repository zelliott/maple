10.42 13.18 B: anyway i guess we're supposed to talk about uh 

13.31 16.01 B: preliminary drug testing before for employment 

17.46 18.97 B: and um 

19.26 23.27 B: i i know uh the agency i work through recently 

23.52 24.29 B: just started 

24.55 25.15 B: um 

26.27 30.44 B: you know doing that (( )) people that were coming on board with our company 

30.59 31.73 B: and uh 

32.66 38.56 B: and we had a new person brought into our department and they called and said you know she would need to be scheduled to 

38.99 39.97 B: you know go down 

40.39 47.09 B: to wherever they held the testing and then the supervisor said you know that uh 

47.98 48.46 B: that 

48.97 58.23 B: er the the woman from the agency said our supervisor said that we were going to have to participate in it as well and and for me personally it didn't really 

58.50 59.93 B: matter either way 

60.20 69.31 B: and i know a lot of companies are doing it nowadays but i know two other employees i work with were really irate about it and granted they'd been there a lot longer than i had 

70.21 71.47 B: and so it it 

71.69 73.89 B: it developed quite a controversy within our 

74.63 76.23 B: area you know our department 

77.41 78.25 B: and um 

78.97 85.58 B: and then turned out you know they they inquired to the supervisor (( )) been there four or five years 

85.89 86.48 B: why 

86.64 90.84 B: why should we have to do this you know we we didn't just join the company 

91.51 95.02 B: and so he said oh he said i guess 

95.47 98.11 B: the agency misunderstood you know he said i wanted 

99.21 100.35 B: the employees that are already 

100.51 101.37 B: here you know 

101.92 104.55 B: to be grandfathered over they don't have to take it but 

104.82 106.13 B: the woman at the agency had 

106.62 108.61 B: misunderstood what he said 

108.79 113.65 B: so everything in the end you know was resolved but it was kind of interesting for a few days 

114.38 120.32 B: listening to all the different disputes going on within our department you know what different people felt and thought about it 

121.66 124.80 B: but um i don't know have you had any experience with that or 

125.44 127.00 A: no um 

127.30 128.39 A: i know it's illegal 

128.51 132.10 A: if they ask you to take a drug test before they you're actually hired 

133.30 134.84 A: but once you're hired i know 

135.52 135.92 A: that 

136.23 137.56 A: they can ask you to do whatever 

138.12 141.88 B: right yeah the girl was hired and then like within a couple days that's when they 

141.43 141.80 A: right 

142.70 143.52 B: they asked her 

143.97 145.99 B: to go down but i think 

146.49 152.51 B: what they do what i've noticed in applications now you know they say are you willing to take one you know 

153.05 154.04 B: if you are hired 

154.53 156.24 B: so you kind of already know ahead of time 

155.23 155.78 A: (( )) 

156.99 158.54 B: you know what's going to happen 

159.58 159.90 A: right 

161.82 162.74 B: but um 

163.00 164.65 B: but i i see it's a lot more 

165.32 166.08 B: predominant 

166.17 167.06 B: you know now 

167.92 168.92 B: than it used to be 

170.90 175.56 B: and i've been looking you know for a new evening job and (( )) even just the hotels and 

175.90 176.68 B: restaurants 

175.98 176.39 A: right 

176.79 180.39 B: have it you know at the back of the application you know are you willing 

180.63 186.35 B: take a drug test are you willing to even you know if necessary have a complete physical and 

187.68 188.31 B: and it's like 

188.48 190.49 B: jeeze 

190.61 193.79 B: pretty heavy duty just for a little part time job you know 

193.91 197.19 B: i mean i could see 

197.59 198.29 B: it was for a 

199.08 201.44 B: full time corporate position maybe 

201.07 203.35 A: f._b._i. 

202.19 203.84 B: yeah really 

204.79 205.55 B: but um 

207.47 210.28 B: that's kind of what i've experienced at least lately you know 

210.44 211.05 B: with it 

212.20 214.69 A: do they schedule after you get hired um 

214.87 215.84 A: do they schedule 

217.55 218.14 A: you know 

218.35 218.88 A: uh 

219.66 222.10 A: test (( )) known about it later 

222.35 224.25 A: like every so many months 

224.34 224.94 A: or 

226.56 228.85 A: anything like that or is it just like a one time 

231.13 231.60 A: deal 

232.09 233.51 B: well um 

234.23 234.99 B: you know 

235.11 238.70 B: for me this is all been recent you know my experience with 

239.05 241.71 B: with it myself but um 

242.14 245.23 B: from some people i've talked to in some other companies 

245.37 246.59 B: um like 

246.70 248.15 B: p._g. and e. which is our 

248.51 248.99 B: you know our 

249.99 254.63 B: uh utility company our main utility company out here um 

255.35 257.77 B: you know they require it when you're hired and then 

258.22 258.81 B: you know 

259.01 260.80 B: they don't have to tell you they can just 

260.90 262.53 B: come and tap you (( )) shoulder 

262.91 263.99 B: and say oh you know 

263.21 263.59 A: right 

264.24 264.98 B: (( )) we mean 

265.52 267.20 B: you know uh periodically 

267.64 268.06 B: and 

268.24 269.52 B: just test you at random 

269.89 274.39 B: doesn't mean they test everybody but you know they can go at random at pick different people and 

274.65 277.29 B: ask them that you know come and take a drug test and 

278.36 281.57 B: and uh they don't have to forewarn you i guess they can just 

282.60 283.48 B: you know come up and 

284.64 286.30 B: ask you to come take one 

288.05 289.04 B: so 

290.52 291.43 B: that's uh 

291.80 293.56 B: another interesting part to it you know 

296.08 298.23 B: in that our society has become so 

298.78 300.82 B: that we have to have so many 

301.04 304.20 B: res- regulations you know 

301.05 302.11 A: right 

305.02 305.39 B: (( )) 

305.87 307.35 B: not like the old days 

307.95 308.40 A: right 

310.24 310.85 B: but um 

311.77 313.63 B: but that's you know mostly 

313.96 318.01 B: my experience with it is more recent and then just but you know different people i've talked to that 

318.83 320.64 B: work for bigger companies you know but 

321.00 322.39 B: what's starting to change and 

323.17 324.00 B: in that regard 

325.81 327.71 A: do you think that they should be able 

328.48 331.52 A: or allowed to do that or do you think that's like a private 

332.66 333.38 A: thing or 

334.04 334.51 A: you know 

334.64 335.50 A: what do you think about that 

336.08 337.83 B: well um 

339.41 341.29 B: you know i guess it kind of depends on 

341.63 344.37 B: what um the circumstance is i mean 

344.88 345.56 B: um 

346.36 352.21 B: i mean i suppose to some degree it's a good thing it protects depending on what their position is you know especially if they're working with like heavy 

351.44 352.11 A: (( )) 

352.33 354.60 B: machinery or something i mean 

355.36 357.30 B: you know you don't want somebody uh 

358.26 359.93 B: under the influence of things and 

360.73 363.51 B: and not operating machinery correctly and having 

364.43 366.35 B: you know some serious accidents occur 

366.40 366.69 A: (( )) 

366.53 368.26 B: not only you know it could only 

368.82 371.21 B: harm that individual besides others you know 

372.49 373.14 B: but um 

374.79 377.48 B: i don't know you know (( )) something 

378.52 379.77 B: not really uh 

381.51 383.06 B: irrelevant you know to your 

383.66 384.19 B: work 

384.48 386.47 B: time and it's just something from your 

388.59 392.30 B: how would you (( )) say your you know leisure time and it's nothing 

393.03 397.23 B: too major or heavy duty shall we say uh i think uh in that regard 

395.07 395.33 A: (( )) 

397.41 400.10 B: should kind of be less personal but i guess it 

400.89 404.84 B: there's so many issues now that have come to light you know and 

405.41 406.23 B: the last 

407.32 411.90 B: ten or fifteen years where i guess a lot of companies feel it's necessary because there's so many 

412.49 413.45 B: issues that came 

413.56 415.01 B: became prevalent you know 

415.86 416.17 A: yeah 

416.92 418.39 B: so it's kind of a it's hard 

418.75 419.41 B: you kind of 

420.23 424.79 B: in some ways you can understand why people want their privacy but say other time you know if other people 

425.51 427.66 B: abuse things so much they have to 

427.90 429.00 B: do something protect 

429.11 430.61 B: their company too you know 

433.95 435.36 A: i know other people around them 

436.95 437.56 B: i'm sorry 

438.05 439.63 A: and other people around them that 

439.74 440.63 A: you know work in 

441.40 442.27 A: with them or 

446.88 449.95 B: yeah that's yeah that's just it too you know i mean 

450.26 450.61 B: if 

450.91 458.43 B: somebody's coming to work always under the influence or something and not really being productive and everybody else is working hard that's not right either you know 

463.06 464.80 B: but i know like a couple of people that 

465.29 470.01 B: you know were that i was referring to had been there like four and five years you know i mean 

470.28 471.36 B: basically 

471.79 472.62 B: what they were 

472.73 473.80 B: mad about is because 

474.11 475.19 B: you know what they 

476.61 478.71 B: did in their leisure time was so 

478.84 479.81 B: limited and 

480.32 483.40 B: wasn't re- had nothing to do with when they were at work but 

484.16 486.87 B: definitely if they took a drug test it would show up you know 

487.14 487.49 A: right 

487.55 491.69 B: and they and they were kind of upset about that because it was like their use was 

491.80 492.93 B: limited and it was some 

493.49 494.05 B: nothing 

494.23 499.38 B: harsh no narcotics or you know shooting up or anything of that nature just 

499.49 500.01 B: you know 

500.21 501.81 B: real limited light 

502.57 503.91 B: use of 

505.27 507.66 B: recreational so to speak 

507.98 510.00 B: and so they were pretty mad because it was like
