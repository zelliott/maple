1.73 2.96 B: hello 

2.38 3.89 A: hey how are you doing 

3.66 4.92 B: all right 

4.61 6.34 A: um my name is aladdin 

6.55 8.29 B: (( my name is tammy )) 

7.69 8.93 A: hi how are you doing 

8.54 10.09 B: (( all right )) 

9.18 12.29 A: so the topic is public school and private schools 

12.49 18.06 B: i guess is this censorship um um i it says censorship 

14.52 15.54 A: what's that 

18.12 19.05 A: okay 

18.13 25.36 B: but i i'm trying to figure out what the lady just said a while ago something about in schools something being talked about in schools 

24.69 29.85 A: yeah in schools and um about books certain books that ah students read 

29.64 31.08 B: oh okay 

30.48 33.67 A: and whether i think it's good for them or not 

34.40 37.10 B: you mean as far as exclusive books 

36.65 37.82 A: yeah 

37.20 38.51 B: (( oh okay )) 

38.38 40.30 A: okay so what do you think about it [laughter] 

39.91 47.35 B: [laughter] um i mean it's okay i think to me it's okay for the 

47.47 51.01 B: the older teenagers you know like they're in high school 

49.14 49.99 A: uh-huh 

50.52 51.70 A: yeah 

51.13 57.51 B: ah but not for the younger children because i have two daughters nine and five and i wouldn't want them to go 

57.65 62.95 B: in the library in the in the you know in their school and pick up something 

59.20 60.10 A: uh-huh 

62.96 64.71 B: and then you know 

64.76 69.00 B: uh-uh they i i just don't i don't agree with that 

67.71 69.97 A: that's not appropriate for them yeah 

69.11 70.66 B: no it's not 

70.35 75.75 A: yeah but well yeah i think so too but you know reading and um 

76.34 77.71 A: you know um 

78.18 83.25 A: improving the skill of reading and all of that is good but it has to be like ah a teacher 

83.38 87.02 A: ah looking up all the topics of the books the students read 

86.71 87.90 B: right 

87.64 88.98 A: yeah 

88.66 100.99 B: i just you know i mean like i say it might not be appropriate for the older teenagers you know because everything's so explicit now you know lyrics to songs and all the you know 

101.01 106.12 B: rap groups and stuff you know that is explicit words you know they're 

102.90 103.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

106.30 112.97 B: you know listening to that and you know i don't uh know to a certain point 

113.04 120.58 B: i don't think that it's good for them at all you know and in another sense so you know it's really not good for none of them 

115.34 117.58 A: that's right it's found everywhere 

120.20 121.63 A: mhm mhm 

120.93 132.44 B: um but you know you if they're going to do it you know if you tell them not to that's how soon they're going to sneak behind your back and and and you know either read it or listen to it so 

122.37 123.41 A: that's right 

131.57 136.67 A: definitely so you got to like encourage them into reading some books and you've got to be there for that 

136.07 137.44 B: yeah 

136.77 139.30 A: yeah that's right that's right 

138.07 144.62 B: yeah but then again you can't watch them for twenty four hours [laughter] yeah because you can't 

141.58 146.54 A: well you ca- exactly exactly but you got to know like you got to do that with the teachers 

146.56 153.47 A: so you would know what your kids are doing at school and ah what kind of books they read and what's hottest to have and all of that 

148.98 150.37 B: right 

152.84 153.97 B: (( right [noise] )) 

153.53 164.94 A: so i think private schools um are much better than public schools because um they like um it's their focusing is more concentrating and they take care of the kids much better i guess 

164.13 175.81 B: yeah that i think that with the pub- ah for the private schools i think they have smaller amount of ah children in the classroom so they can give them more individual attention 

172.97 173.87 A: mhm 

175.51 176.63 A: yeah 

176.00 181.00 B: and and keep a closer eye on them but you know public school there's no way 

180.83 181.90 A: that's right 

181.07 183.59 B: you know because there's there's too many 

183.73 189.64 B: you know the public schools now are overcrowded so um you know they can't keep a eye on 

186.52 187.61 A: that's right 

189.82 193.08 B: ah who's doing what and where you know 

192.23 193.63 A: mhm mhm 

193.71 194.68 B: um 

194.00 206.52 A: that's right there's no much attention for that so you wouldn't know the type of books they read and and who was taking care of that you wouldn't even trust the teacher you'd need to like be there every time 

196.63 197.96 B: [cough] no 

200.74 203.70 B: no you wouldn't unless you went up there [laughter] 

206.40 207.39 B: true 

207.06 208.35 A: that's right 

208.45 211.09 B: yeah because ah atlanta 

208.45 209.89 A: so where are you from 

210.68 211.86 A: (( oh okay )) 

211.82 214.42 B: yes it's pretty hot down here today 

213.73 215.33 A: oh yeah it's 

214.46 217.93 B: yeah it's eighty one degrees so yeah 

215.65 217.09 A: oh my god 

217.31 218.69 A: oh my god it's 

217.99 221.88 B: well it's it's good compared to the you know rain we've been having so 

221.20 222.16 A: oh 

222.94 223.89 A: okay 

222.98 224.16 B: but um 

224.78 231.95 B: yeah i had called earlier and they couldn't find nobody d- you know because you can call in and do it now 

231.39 232.79 A: that's right yeah 

232.10 242.28 B: you know and i didn't know about that so ah i just called in where i could go ahead and get my three calls over with because this is you know if you wait for the computer to do it you might be waiting forever 

241.75 246.44 A: that's right but i think we still have to be like talking at the topic for 

246.01 247.06 B: okay 

246.45 249.62 A: like straight ten minutes and you know 

250.29 251.28 B: well 

250.40 251.34 A: (( still )) 

252.04 253.52 B: i mean you know 

252.18 255.16 A: well i don't know i don't have anything in mind 

255.50 259.03 A: but um well i'm not into reading so much so 

258.49 259.57 B: right 

259.43 262.02 A: i don't really enjoy reading and 

261.40 274.78 B: i read occasionally ah but you know i have to i watch what my daughters and them read um you know and i watch i kind of keep an eye out on ah the cable channels that they watch 

262.98 264.29 A: yeah 

266.39 267.61 A: definitely 

274.22 275.45 A: mhm 

274.78 279.71 B: because my daughter um both my daughters are into the videos and 

279.68 290.18 B: um you know one of them likes rap and one don't and you know it's like okay it's explicit you know some of it's explicit and i'm like uh-uh 

284.00 284.78 A: oh 

290.04 291.35 A: that's right yeah 

290.34 296.70 B: ah just like the books and ah you want you know they want to get hold of the books and i'm like 

292.68 293.81 A: that's right 

296.85 306.14 B: no but um what they need to do is i would think is just go age appropriate and maybe 

306.27 318.97 B: ah breakdown you know the categories of books for the proper ages you know and and if there is any explicit books in the in the school inside the library they need to you know 

311.73 312.80 A: mhm 

317.58 318.38 A: mhm 

319.01 320.45 B: get rid of them 

319.82 321.79 A: that's right that's right 

321.30 325.73 B: um i can't think of really nothing else that they could do i mean 

325.62 336.94 B: you can't guard a child twenty four hours you know ah i know i can't and if they're not at school and they're not with you and they're somewhere else it's like okay 

327.86 329.94 A: that's right that's right [noise] 

337.06 338.85 B: how do you know what they're doing 

338.38 339.88 A: (( exactly [noise] )) 

339.24 348.27 B: you know but you that's where you have to have trust in your children and know that they'll make um a pretty proper decision 

342.48 343.67 A: exactly 

347.92 349.02 A: mhm 

348.29 354.05 B: you know i mean a a a right decision on what not to do and what to do so 

353.82 355.02 A: mhm 

354.42 355.41 B: um 

355.48 358.17 A: oh that's right that's right i think yeah 

357.40 365.42 B: i don't know because when i was growing up in in my school um you know i graduated in eighty three so i when i was in school in 

365.61 377.64 B: you know from s- sixty fi- i mean well si- about sixty seven sixty eight um you know when i went in my library in the school you know we didn't what explicit was you know we didn't 

370.48 371.52 A: mhm 

375.92 376.85 A: (( uh-huh )) 

377.57 382.68 B: have no books like that and and we didn't have to worry about um 

379.05 380.44 A: oh yeah 

382.73 391.64 B: you know not watching something on t._v. that was bad for us or or listening to this type of music or anything or reading any kind of books out of the library because 

391.65 395.29 B: all of it you know was o- it was okay you know so 

393.92 394.87 A: mhm 

395.80 398.04 B: but you never know these days 

397.43 403.04 A: besides it wasn't that open you know saying that it was like um everything was under control and now 

399.85 401.00 B: right 

402.10 403.26 B: right 

403.06 406.76 A: everybody wants to know everything and so you end 

404.72 405.87 B: right 

406.16 410.15 B: yeah because you know th- with everything's going on with all these children 

409.91 410.87 A: mhm 

410.24 421.80 B: you know they're um you know you didn't i didn't know what molest [mn] you know being molested was you know back then and you know all these children being abused and molested and stuff and so 

415.61 416.66 A: mhm 

420.94 423.03 A: oh yeah yeah exactly 

421.84 425.49 B: it's it's a lot going on um you know i c- 

423.34 428.36 A: exactly and they read stuff that makes them curious to do what's in the book so 

426.44 429.14 B: yeah to try yeah 

428.40 431.40 A: that's right that's right that's terrible stuff 

429.44 435.75 B: yeah there there's a lot of books that you know tell you how to do this and tell you how to do that [laughter] 

433.77 444.33 A: that's right that's right and unfortunately you probably will find these books in like [mn] school libraries so i think they have to like control this and 

443.72 445.53 B: yeah 

444.42 450.22 A: ah see what the kids are reading and all of that and always report this to their 

448.48 451.39 B: i just think you know like if they're in the library 

450.92 451.91 A: mhm 

451.29 456.91 B: and they're reading a book that um you know either the librarian or the teacher 

452.65 453.55 A: mhm 

456.80 470.15 B: said you know ever so often you know come by on me and kind of acknowledge the kind of book they're reading and what it's about and stuff you know and see if it is explicit you know 

463.49 464.43 A: mhm 

465.03 466.32 A: mhm 

468.92 470.83 A: yeah yeah 

470.23 473.41 B: and you know kind of keep a mon- monitor them 

473.02 474.11 A: that's right 

473.67 477.86 B: um that's the only way that i could see that they could do that so 

474.12 475.14 A: that's right 

477.10 479.48 A: that's right that's right 

479.71 480.96 A: (( well i don't know )) 

481.20 486.80 A: [laughter] i guess the i don't know there's nothing else to talk about in this subject [laughter] 

484.18 485.22 B: [laughter] 

485.95 490.64 B: yeah i mean there's only so much um you can talk about censorship 

490.20 491.32 A: what's that 

490.98 503.26 B: i said there's only so much censorship you can talk about [laughter] um you know maybe they could get together and pass a law i don't know that you know them kind of books are not allowed in the school system 

494.01 496.58 A: that's right yeah that's right 

502.84 503.96 A: mhm 

503.40 507.48 B: and ah you know ban the books from there i don't know um 

506.41 507.41 A: mhm 

507.87 511.02 B: i doubt they would do that though um 

511.19 513.53 B: because they got a lot of people that put out 

513.16 514.31 A: yeah 

513.72 518.15 B: books like that but they're mainly for the older crowd um 

516.88 517.86 A: yeah 

519.28 523.41 B: so i don't know i don't even read books like that so 

519.35 520.21 A: (( well )) 

522.65 525.24 A: oh me too i mean i don't really enjoy it 

525.19 532.15 B: yeah i don't i don't read you know that much and when i do it's it's not nothing like that so 

532.09 534.06 A: well like novels or 

533.56 534.84 B: yeah 

534.22 542.21 A: like stories yeah so i don't know kids are getting curious these days they want to know everything about this things that 

536.46 537.39 B: but 

539.36 540.26 B: yeah 

541.26 552.08 B: yeah and then curiosity killed the cat you know the curious you go and and try to do it you know instead of you know and they're not going to come to mother and father and say well 

543.48 545.26 A: exactly 

546.64 548.35 A: that's right that's right 

551.98 552.90 A: mhm 

551.98 566.39 B: ah i read this you know um you know what is this you know they're not going to do that they're just going to go because the- they're feeling peer pressure from their friends and they're going you know go along with them because they're trying it you know and that's where they get in trouble 

560.22 561.21 A: mhm 

564.11 565.46 A: yeah that's right 

566.00 567.00 A: that's right 

567.55 573.44 A: that's right that's right you've got to always watch what they read what they watch and the friends they're hanging out with 

571.12 572.00 B: yeah 

573.35 580.56 B: yeah and then some of the other children's parents you know really is not paying attention to them and really don't care what they're reading 

578.35 579.45 A: yeah 

580.21 582.16 A: it feels like they don't care 

582.12 583.32 B: right 

583.23 585.43 A: yeah i know i know 

585.95 587.44 A: well you know [noise] 

589.51 590.74 A: (( um )) 

590.97 591.92 B: (( and i don't )) 

590.97 595.59 A: so are your kids in public schools or private school okay 

592.82 594.73 B: yeah they're in public school 

594.86 599.89 B: and i'm i'm i don't like that because see private school is is more expensive
