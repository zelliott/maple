29.22 29.78 A: (( [cough] )) 

30.09 34.68 A: they just did the same one a little while ago with me same 

33.94 34.83 B: oh 

34.84 36.28 A: exact survey 

36.61 37.67 B: really 

37.31 43.54 A: yeah i don't know if they do it three times in a row for the same survey see if they get different answers or 

43.80 47.90 A: what's going on this is this is the first time i've ever done this too so 

45.48 46.25 B: (( ah )) 

48.08 49.17 B: okay 

50.49 61.06 A: anyway censorship of books in school [laughter] yeah i agree to a point that ah some books should be censored um 

61.92 63.24 A: but not all 

61.96 63.08 B: (( [mn] what )) 

63.09 69.26 B: what what instances do you think that they should be censored i mean censored for what reason 

69.20 72.87 A: well like ah pornographic books and 

72.28 73.98 B: oh yeah yeah 

73.61 82.01 A: you know there's a lot of that stuff that they have access to in libraries that ah students shouldn't be allowed to get to 

78.54 79.42 B: (( mhm )) 

82.86 83.99 A: um 

85.16 89.95 A: i don't know too much about ah all the books that are out there but 

90.01 92.25 A: you know what they're talking about what kinds [cough] 

95.23 97.52 B: yeah i i don't know um 

98.50 99.53 B: (( i mean )) 

99.88 107.43 B: just censorship as far as what is on an approved reading list or what they carry in the library i don't 

107.58 108.59 B: i mean 

109.02 115.49 A: well it sounds like what they're talking about is whatever they feel that they want to censor they censors 

109.31 110.11 B: (( um )) 

115.45 116.57 B: yeah 

116.01 116.99 A: um 

117.41 123.40 A: and i guess that's the question they're asking us if we feel that they should have that right to censor 

123.71 128.21 A: books at [noise] at will 

127.72 128.75 B: yeah 

129.15 130.09 B: um 

131.02 132.24 B: i mean i guess 

132.90 133.95 B: (( they )) 

134.01 136.67 B: you know should be able to censor for 

136.86 140.74 B: you know like you said pornographic reasons or 

140.97 145.52 B: but then you know again who's to say what's pornographic and what's not 

145.21 146.15 A: yeah 

145.48 158.04 B: you know what's pornographic and what's a you know literary classic you know i don't know i mean it seems like you know the instances you read in the news where they're trying to censor books always 

150.75 151.59 A: well 

158.33 159.28 B: (( seems )) 

159.47 171.05 B: for an illogical reason i mean you know schools that censor things like you know tom sawyer or huckleberry finn i never understood that 

168.79 169.63 A: yeah 

171.49 172.46 B: um 

171.53 176.23 A: i think a lot of it depends on you know what age the kids are 

176.22 177.59 B: yeah 

178.01 179.07 B: um 

181.74 185.33 B: yeah i mean that's that's true 

185.55 186.63 B: um 

188.41 190.14 B: i don't know i guess you know like 

190.66 192.62 B: public schools should just have 

193.01 195.63 B: public and private i mean usually 

196.18 197.21 B: there's just 

197.30 202.58 B: certain books that you know just year after year the students are required to read and 

202.87 203.92 B: um 

206.54 211.57 B: i don't know i've never you know personally had any experience with censorship of books 

211.60 216.09 B: you know i mean it it was never an issue when i was in school 

216.53 217.79 B: as far as 

217.84 221.34 B: you know not being allowed to read certain books 

221.58 224.54 A: yeah i didn't have that problem either um 

224.84 227.60 A: that's a whole different generation or two 

228.44 229.01 A: (( [cough] )) 

230.16 231.15 A: um 

234.11 236.10 A: i don't know you know there's a lot of 

236.91 242.56 A: stuff that's too graphic i don't really think that young kids should be able to you know have access to it 

242.87 245.72 A: um 

246.03 248.82 A: actually pornographic material 

249.14 250.71 A: (( anything that's )) 

249.58 250.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

252.58 260.12 A: not ah appropriate for kids to read if you wouldn't let them read it at home then i don't think i don't feel that they should be able to read it 

257.92 261.80 B: yeah you wouldn't want them reading it in school yeah 

266.69 267.61 A: (( [mn] are )) 

269.76 270.86 A: you still there 

271.03 273.49 B: yeah i'm sorry i'm driving trying to 

273.96 276.19 B: not to get killed um 

276.71 277.90 B: yeah i mean 

278.55 281.16 B: i i agree with that you know if you don't 

281.21 287.97 B: if a parent wouldn't want them reading it in the home certainly they wouldn't want them reading it in the school um 

290.92 298.00 B: [noise] i mean it it some of it has just got to be common sense you know i mean what's appropriate for what age group 

297.77 298.67 A: yeah 

298.06 303.89 B: you know i mean some of it just seems so you know common sensical but 

302.51 303.07 A: (( [cough] )) 

304.83 305.79 B: um 

306.76 307.82 B: (( i don't know )) 

311.29 312.92 A: (( yeah i don't know it's ah )) 

314.54 321.86 A: it's hard to really know what kind of books they're talking about you know if there was examples and you've read them yourself you'd know 

321.89 324.23 A: no i don't want my kid to read that or 

324.60 325.60 A: um 

325.62 327.33 A: i think that's okay 

327.52 328.29 A: (( but ah )) 

327.54 328.81 B: yeah 

329.52 330.53 A: (( um )) 

335.34 335.99 A: [cough] 

338.93 340.71 B: (( i don't know i mean )) 

342.43 343.38 B: it 

343.61 350.88 B: it seems like you know parents should be able to control what their you know kids are reading and i don't know maybe 

350.94 352.05 B: um 

352.88 354.71 B: you know at the school 

354.98 356.01 B: you know 

356.41 357.37 B: (( ah )) 

357.72 366.39 B: have the parents play a more active role and and get their input you know maybe it wouldn't be such a problem in some areas 

366.26 369.10 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

370.54 372.04 A: i don't know there's 

373.52 376.94 A: [noise] i say there's a whole spectrum of books out there that ah 

378.59 383.53 A: i'm sure are not appropriate for children i still don't want 

382.58 383.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

383.90 387.89 A: to school has the right um 

388.16 389.33 A: (( to censor )) 

390.30 392.52 A: (( them but i guess what )) 

391.54 405.99 B: yeah i mean i don't know if you know well what kind of context they mean i mean censor in in respect to you're not having them in the school library or censoring or you know not part of a class curriculum 

406.07 407.21 B: i mean 

408.32 409.50 B: i don't 

410.27 415.13 B: you know it's hard to censor a public library you know um 

414.27 415.53 A: yeah 

415.43 423.69 B: and in in that sense you know as far as what books children read from the public library you know that's a that's the 

424.03 434.83 B: responsibility i think of the parent to you know decide what's appropriate for the you know the child to be allowed to take out of the library 

435.08 436.84 B: you know um 

435.97 436.77 A: yeah 

437.16 438.53 B: you know maybe 

438.68 452.81 B: children of a certain age you know when they check out a book from the library they should you know need to be accompanied by their parent too you know so the parent's aware that they're checking out whatever content book they've chosen 

452.82 463.33 A: yeah oh my gosh so you know just like they do at the movies you know p._g. rated or whatever you have to be a certain age to get those books from the library but um 

458.09 459.20 B: yeah 

463.53 465.36 A: (( i don't know [noise] you )) 

469.13 470.42 A: know it's 

470.60 475.79 A: it's a tough one actually you're not there all day long to monitor what they read 

476.61 477.48 A: um 

476.80 477.87 B: (( yeah i don't )) 

478.95 481.50 B: know and in one sense i mean 

481.52 485.14 B: at least they're reading you know [mn] i mean 

485.50 486.33 B: it 

487.19 488.46 B: it's it's 

488.53 493.47 B: an actual book and they're actually reading instead of like sitting in front of the t._v. 

493.53 495.78 B: i mean i know there's a lot of you know 

495.93 500.53 B: garbage out there you know and the content of books are bad but 

500.68 501.74 B: you know 

503.62 504.37 A: (( [cough] )) 

504.87 506.07 A: yeah it's 

507.14 509.52 A: there's a lot of it that they can get into 

507.64 508.60 B: (( [noise] )) 

509.79 510.94 B: yeah 

511.06 512.74 B: but even you know 

512.76 515.08 B: i think reading a violent book 

515.58 516.55 B: you know 

516.70 520.06 B: better than sitting in front of the t._v. and 

520.26 523.16 B: watching something violent at least you're coming 

523.34 525.91 B: using your brain a little more by reading 

526.87 527.68 A: yeah 

527.06 530.94 B: at least they're kind of you know kind of developing more 

531.20 532.50 B: by you know 

532.80 533.91 B: reading 

534.00 539.41 B: than sitting on the couch watching something i don't know i mean i'm kind of going on a tangent 

539.30 545.13 A: [laughter] that's all right it helps get rid of that ten minutes [laughter] [laughter] 

540.53 541.33 B: (( ah ))
