23.90 26.03 B: (( i'm a bar smoker )) 

25.93 26.87 A: oh 

26.52 28.60 B: that's what i would call myself 

27.99 31.38 A: okay so like whenever you go out you'll maybe have a couple of cigarettes 

31.04 32.37 B: yeah 

31.70 33.19 A: all right that i guess that's 

33.49 44.23 A: yeah i've done that a couple of times but i kinda stopped because uh didn't make me feel too good i kinda got sick but that might have been 'cause excessive alcohol but anyways um 

45.32 49.31 A: so uh we had to talk about smoking prevention programs and whatnot 

49.15 50.60 B: yeah 

49.97 51.76 A: okay so uh 

51.65 54.63 B: [sigh] and in public places so 

53.65 55.57 A: oh yeah 

56.19 59.28 A: okay so like yeah what do you think [laughter] about stuff like that 

58.33 61.36 B: well actually where i live 

61.44 65.57 B: they have banned smoking in most of the restaurants 

66.12 67.26 B: um 

67.31 76.65 B: and unless they serve x. amount i live in a college town unless they serve x. amount of liquor sales or whatever so 

70.92 71.78 A: uh-huh 

76.80 80.21 B: basically what has happened is 

80.55 86.23 B: um quite a few businesses have just discontinued the food 

87.03 90.90 B: so since they banned the smoking um 

91.39 95.06 B: i know of at least four businesses that have 

95.18 98.49 B: either closed or just quit serving food 

98.72 101.13 A: (( [noise] oh wow i didn't know that so )) 

99.48 104.28 B: um because of the smoking at least here where i live so 

103.36 104.23 A: uh-huh 

104.39 108.10 B: you know i used to think that oh it's no big deal 

108.03 108.94 A: mhm 

108.13 109.18 B: (( but )) 

109.44 111.49 A: i guess it's affecting small business 

109.62 114.12 B: on the other hand i used to go to two of the restaurants that are now closed 

113.46 116.43 A: oh okay wow yeah so it's personally affected you 

116.71 118.55 B: yeah i would say so 

118.34 119.41 A: okay 

119.54 127.49 A: oh uh yeah um actually like um my parents own a restaurant uh back home and um 

127.61 132.85 A: like we don't have any laws on smoking in texas but um 

131.59 132.55 B: uh-huh 

134.00 135.19 A: like 

134.02 136.86 B: but do they allow smokers in the restaurant 

135.38 143.78 A: yeah yeah we have a separate smoking section and everything but i mean it hasn't ever been like a problem or anything but uh i think like 

143.63 150.48 A: these type of programs would i think hurt a lot of small businesses in the end and i mean you've personally been affected 

147.91 152.94 B: yeah because if your parents if if none of those smokers went in there any more 

152.36 157.48 A: yeah yeah i mean and a lot of people do request that separate smoking section 

157.86 161.48 A: you know so um i guess it's a 

157.94 159.00 B: right 

161.87 169.60 A: i i i would kinda be against the smoking in public places program 'cause it does hurt a lot of small businesses 

170.01 174.15 B: yeah yeah that's that's what i would say i mean 

170.67 171.81 A: but 

175.04 177.03 B: i just think that it 

177.04 178.84 B: it [sigh] 

179.43 181.53 B: i don't know i mean 

181.63 186.08 B: smokers will say that it's getting harder to smoke anywhere so 

184.97 187.09 A: yeah yeah i i would 

186.12 189.61 B: and it's still legal so you know 

187.58 188.46 A: uh-huh 

190.09 197.07 A: i didn't yeah i mean i don't advocate smoking at all because i know what it can do to people and i've seen a lot of people go through 

197.33 203.51 A: uh tremendous illnesses and and i guess like these type of programs are meant to 

203.97 210.19 A: prevent people from getting [laughter] [mn] it's meant to deter smoking more and more right 

209.61 215.15 B: right and to and to reduce your exposure to second hand smoke 'cause 

214.11 216.44 A: yeah and i guess that's uh 

215.14 229.36 B: well at least the the smoking prevention ads that they play here are like if you work in a bar you're exposed to five cigarettes an hour it's like smoking five cigarettes an hour or something like that 

228.95 238.39 A: oh wow i i've never seen an ad like that oh that's a but those are like scary statistics right that a lot of people would just like try to 

230.57 232.54 B: (( some yeah )) 

238.18 240.63 B: yeah i don't know if they'd believe 'em or not 

239.96 251.97 A: yeah and i guess they're just scare tactics that people wanna use to prevent more people from [noise] taking up smoking or from or maybe support the uh the program to uh 

253.05 255.70 A: ban it in public places and whatnot 

255.43 260.31 B: i think the best my personal feeling is that the best 

260.44 266.35 B: preventative it's not i haven't really seen too many people successfully quit smoking 

266.00 267.13 A: (( oh okay )) 

266.67 272.00 B: i think the easiest thing is to keep people from smoking 

271.81 274.81 A: oh okay 'cause once you start it's hard to quit 

272.86 273.93 B: so 

274.30 277.87 B: once you start you can't seem to quit 

277.43 278.60 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

277.97 281.20 B: so if you just don't start you know 

281.21 283.35 B: i'm not sure how 

284.14 293.55 B: effective these these cheesy ad campaigns are i mean i would i don't know what they're doing with smoking prevention in the schools but 

293.69 294.62 B: i'm 

294.83 300.00 B: you know i mean for the younger kids but that's where i would rather see them use the 

300.99 302.07 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

301.04 304.21 B: i'd rather see 'em use the money towards you know 

304.13 317.81 B: my husband's parents he's he's forty and his parents quit smoking because he came home from school every day for months on end going cigarettes are bad and you need to quit smoking or you're gonna kill yourself 

317.76 320.34 A: oh wow so like okay 

318.11 319.11 B: (( you know )) 

319.63 323.67 B: and they quit smoking because he was just harping on 'em all the time 

321.11 322.11 A: wow 

322.91 326.39 A: yeah [laughter] yeah um 

324.05 325.03 B: you know 

325.52 330.40 B: and he's never been a smoker even not even socially i mean 

327.48 328.57 A: (( oh okay )) 

330.18 331.31 A: mhm 

330.73 332.15 B: so whatever 

332.20 334.80 B: they did at his school sunk in 

334.74 341.93 A: yeah i imagine also like nowadays they have all those uh truth commercials i don't know if you've seen them yeah 

340.39 343.45 B: yeah just eliminate lies 

342.81 347.48 A: yeah yeah yeah and uh i think those are really effective 

347.51 358.38 A: like uh they always get me thinking about like what kind of uh tactics the big tobacco companies are using and like 

359.34 365.94 A: things like how how bad smoking is for you how bad smoking is actually for you you know 

366.15 366.94 A: like 

366.22 369.08 B: right in what they've covered up and 

368.12 379.01 A: and those are like mainly targeted towards teenagers 'cause teenagers are in the ads and i think those that's where i think smoking actually starts right like mostly in your teenage years 

377.29 384.18 B: if not junior high yeah young teen i mean i know some people that were young teenagers 

383.58 385.01 A: (( [noise] yeah yeah yeah )) 

384.40 387.77 B: you know like twelve thirteen fourteen 

387.10 389.05 A: oh okay yeah 

388.58 391.61 B: so yeah that that makes sense 

390.96 396.45 A: yeah those are and they always come on during like shows which are like directed at teens 

395.28 397.11 B: teeny bopper shows 

396.43 401.97 A: or not even teeny bop- like uh i i remember i used to watch wrestling when i a few years ago 

401.61 403.32 B: yeah yeah 

401.94 411.67 A: [laughter] when i and so like always i saw truth commercials during that time and uh i guess it just made sense because of the audience you know 

411.44 412.45 B: uh-huh 

413.16 414.09 B: uh-huh 

413.31 413.87 A: (( [cough] )) 

413.92 424.43 A: but i don't know how much the government like itself is actually doing to like or the federal government is doing to prevent more prevent kids from smoking you know 

424.53 426.45 B: right i mean 

429.00 443.21 B: 'cause don't i mean i can't remember but one of my friends is canadian and he said in canada cigarettes are like five or six dollars a pack so a lot of people don't smoke because it's too expensive 

442.52 457.16 A: yeah but like i've i know like that the like i've i've seen studies that like show that like the uh like elasticity of demand for smoker smokers like who already like are smoking they would pay like 

443.37 444.32 B: i mean 

457.14 469.11 A: a premium [noise] on that like because of the taxes and everything with all the taxes like it's hard to because of like the difficulty in quitting they would pay that extra price you know 

468.79 472.30 B: right but maybe it would deter people from starting 

472.28 473.62 A: yeah maybe 

472.95 477.16 B: i mean like how many thirteen year olds wanna blow six bucks 

477.21 481.40 A: yeah i know i know 'cause they would uh rather be spending on something else 

481.31 483.27 B: yeah like you know 

483.32 485.94 B: video games or something i mean 

485.98 486.55 B: (( [sigh] )) 

487.40 491.39 A: [noise] yeah probably probably something they would like a little more you know 

488.27 489.32 B: i mean 

491.68 496.10 A: but like obviously there's like uh peer pressure and whatnot to 

496.16 499.03 B: well right and then i think more 

496.64 497.59 A: [noise] 

499.36 501.50 B: i think more people that are 

501.71 506.95 B: if your parents smoke you have easier access to cigarettes 

507.51 511.62 B: so there's more of a chance that you could start smoking 

511.21 514.13 A: yeah yeah probably i i would definitely see that 

512.57 514.80 B: you know because i mean 

515.81 521.70 B: my mom who died of lung cancer smoked three four five packs a day 

521.35 522.67 A: oh wow 

522.09 526.64 B: i mean so there were cigarettes ashtrays everywhere 

526.65 527.77 A: (( oh okay )) 

527.13 528.56 B: you know so 

528.43 531.35 A: so you had a very easy access to 

530.62 532.94 B: oh yes yes i mean 

531.62 538.82 A: but did you like was that an affecting factor why you started smoking or did you ever like smoke like regularly 

538.20 539.12 B: (( uh-uh )) 

538.92 539.89 A: okay 

539.29 542.01 B: there's four kids in my family and only 

542.11 544.91 B: only um one of us smokes 

545.53 553.75 B: i mean and she's hardcore smoker and the other three of us never have really smoked and probably never will 

553.34 554.49 A: [noise] oh okay 

553.93 562.69 B: um i mean other than the social actually one of us i don't think she's ever probably even lit a cigarette um 

556.31 557.36 A: (( [noise] )) 

560.62 562.79 A: (( [noise] oh okay [noise] [noise] )) 

564.54 566.49 B: well i know 

567.59 569.58 B: that um 

572.06 578.32 B: i guess because my mom was such a heavy smoker she had real obvious 

578.98 584.40 B: you know like the hacking cough from about forty on and stuff like that 

584.24 585.43 A: (( oh okay )) 

584.54 585.53 B: that i 

585.61 588.07 B: i can remember you know 

587.02 587.98 A: mhm 

588.40 590.94 B: and so i think that did kinda 

589.63 593.06 A: was that a deterrence yeah i can imagine that that kind of like 

592.23 595.07 B: i mean that was kinda of a deterrent yeah 

593.97 599.89 A: really prevalent uh effect would deter people from or teens most
