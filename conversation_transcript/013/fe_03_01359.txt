0.79 2.01 A: hello 

1.55 2.67 B: hi 

2.49 4.76 A: hi my name is kevin how are you 

3.80 5.28 B: my name's jenny 

5.00 6.90 A: jenny where are you from jenny 

6.37 8.63 B: pavilion new york where are you from 

8.20 12.40 A: i am uh i'm from portland oregon but i'm going to school in provo utah 

12.27 14.46 B: utah so this is all the way out in utah 

14.25 16.20 A: [laughter] 

15.72 17.94 B: so did you catch that topic 

17.89 19.76 A: yes i think we're supposed to talk a- 

18.02 20.62 B: it was about school i couldn't quite hear it 

20.19 25.15 A: i think we're supposed to talk about should public schools have the right to censor certain books 

24.90 32.37 B: ah yeah okay i couldn't hear all the rest of it my family had the t._v. on too loud and i was heading for another room but i didn't make it 

27.69 29.57 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

31.91 33.86 A: i understand 

33.39 34.55 B: no i don't 

34.60 36.22 A: oh you don't i'm sorry 

36.36 37.40 B: i don't 

36.92 41.52 A: th- the question was should public schools be able to censor books 

40.87 42.39 B: books i don't think so 

42.22 44.05 A: okay i don't either 

44.05 45.72 B: i don't think it's right at all 

44.16 45.10 A: well 

45.59 48.27 A: i don't think so but at the same time i don't think 

48.42 54.11 A: certain like adult material of a book should be available to my child at school either 

53.54 60.03 B: well there is certain things like i would say like you know obviously pornographic books and crap they shouldn't be reading that 

59.76 60.67 A: uh-huh 

60.72 64.41 B: but then again who decides what's pornographic and what's not 

64.06 73.79 A: exactly and then there's always the difficult decision you have social morality you know because what's pornographic to joe down the street isn't necessarily pornographic to someone else 

65.15 66.43 B: that's the problem 

73.39 77.99 B: yeah and there's places that they had books like tom sawyer being banned 

77.93 79.20 A: that's ridiculous 

78.71 83.95 B: because they had the n. word in them well god that was written a hundred and fifty years ago what do you want 

80.44 81.46 A: yeah 

83.60 92.81 A: [laughter] well i i completely agree with that so i guess the real question lies in how you decide which books to be you know are not appropriate 

92.80 95.39 B: that would be the difficult decision i suppose 

95.10 96.52 A: yeah how would you 

95.40 102.08 B: because you're gonna have prudes out there that want every little thing and they're only gonna be reading goldi- goldilocks throughout their lives 

98.53 99.54 A: uh-huh 

100.99 103.29 A: [laughter] 

102.40 107.46 B: and you got people out there that don't care what they read and they're gonna be reading stuff that they shouldn't be seeing 

107.67 109.44 A: yep oh i agree 

109.93 110.81 A: well 

110.92 113.71 A: [lipsmack] so what do they do [laughter] i guess 

113.85 119.36 B: well i guess it depends on where you live you know i think down south they're more tending to 

120.03 125.27 B: i guess you could say prudishness and they're go- they are more likely to block more things than they are up north 

121.73 122.64 A: uh-huh 

124.89 125.97 A: that's true 

126.54 127.55 A: (( that's true )) 

126.69 129.37 B: because the northern people don't seem quite as 

130.45 134.06 B: i don't know prudish [laughter] i guess it's the only good word for it 

133.50 139.45 A: do you think uh a parent you know how they have the school board committee which is elected do you think an elected committee for that would work at all 

140.25 141.53 B: um 

141.70 148.80 B: yeah i guess within reason because i guess if you're living in a certain section of the country and they really really despise 

148.93 154.05 B: certain types of books if they all vote on it and that's the way it oughta be i suppose 

153.66 155.22 A: yeah 

155.15 160.07 B: but there shouldn't be like a i don't think there should be like a national board of standards or something 

158.99 163.25 A: [noise] no i'm i'm completely against having some central committee 

161.12 170.12 B: because then again it's like you're deciding for one section of the country that's gonna have different values than another section of the country and there's just gonna be big arguments over it 

167.16 168.59 A: exactly 

169.84 174.05 A: yep i think that's a great idea is just having the a central 

174.15 184.10 A: school board or committee that's voted upon and they can oversee books that are in question but in general i think it's better just to [cough] have censorship in the family right i mean you 

183.63 188.40 B: yeah that too and i suppose there would be like if you had 

184.69 185.73 A: [noise] 

189.18 203.13 B: a really backwards school system which obviously there's gonna be a few and they were voting out all sorts of books right and left there should be like a state review board that you if you were as a parent could appeal it to if you wanted to 

193.47 194.44 A: uh-huh 

202.83 203.64 A: true 

204.02 206.51 B: because there is gonna that is gonna happen too 

206.35 214.17 A: yeah well and i'm sure some individuals feel very strongly about certain books and they'd never ever give in so there needs to be an outlet to you know 

214.13 228.35 A: if they don't want their child exposed to that they simply need to be responsible that their child doesn't get exposed to that you know and they i mean there's things all around life your children need to realize that you know you can't be guarded away from everything you just need to learn on your own that that's appropriate and that's not appropriate 

227.90 233.68 B: there's also um the schools could make allowances you know read this book or this book 

233.34 234.19 A: uh-huh 

234.24 235.70 A: that's a good point [mn] 

234.87 240.33 B: have a couple of lists not just like when i was in school it was like read this book whether you like it or not 

236.26 237.82 A: yeah i like the alternative 

240.29 250.97 A: yeah no i'd say that's a good book uh that's a good point is having the alternative in fact when i was at school they had that they had a you can read this and if your parents deem that it's not appropriate then you read this one 

250.59 254.39 B: no we didn't have that everybody read the same book no matter how boring it was 

253.82 256.19 A: [laughter] where'd you grow up 

255.69 257.72 B: um new york western new york 

257.34 258.30 A: okay 

258.43 263.48 B: but i i like reading a read a lot of books but uh 

261.73 262.76 A: uh-huh 

263.62 268.32 B: some of the books they used to make you read in school like shakespeare i found intolerably boring 

267.73 270.66 A: [laughter] [noise] 

269.25 273.84 B: and that other guy that wrote the pearl and stuff like that oh 

273.82 274.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

273.90 275.42 B: that was terrible too 

274.99 276.38 A: yeah 

276.25 277.97 B: but they make you read that stuff 

277.27 281.97 A: [noise] yeah yeah did your parents ever have any say in it at all 

281.57 286.01 B: no no it was just these were assigned books and you read 'em that was it 

285.54 288.80 A: yeah it's the whole the state knows better idea 

288.21 294.89 B: but they never picked anything bad like i said it was like shakespeare and uh hemingway and stuff like that 

292.58 293.59 A: (( the classics )) 

294.76 295.58 A: okay 

296.75 298.14 A: well interesting 

298.18 304.15 A: so you think that uh public universities would have the same level as uh a k. through twelve 

304.52 306.08 A: kind of censorship thing 

304.77 309.20 B: no i think public universities the kids are old enough they should read what they wanna read 

308.65 310.54 A: yep i agree too 

310.03 311.40 B: they're gonna anyways 

311.10 313.80 A: yep [laughter] yeah good luck making a 

313.39 318.27 B: yeah good luck making a college kids oh no you can't read this book that'll make 'em all read it 

313.82 314.71 A: college 

316.19 317.11 A: (( kid )) 

317.71 319.05 A: exactly 

318.44 324.21 B: i guess that would be a good way to get 'em to read it ban it and then uh they'll all be out there on the internet getting bootleg copies of it 

320.01 321.63 A: [laughter] 

323.28 326.41 A: [laughter] just put censored on everything huh 

325.85 326.83 B: yeah 

326.74 328.54 A: that's a good point 

328.26 329.56 B: they would too 

329.36 335.69 A: yeah oh absolutely i'm actually graduating i'm a masters student right now at uh brigaman university 

335.14 336.77 B: oh really cool what do you take 

336.64 342.39 A: uh management information systems it's a business degree with an emphasis in information systems 

342.07 347.44 B: i thought about going back to school and getting a i only got an associates degree i'm a registered nurse 

346.83 348.70 A: oh yeah well my wife's a nurse 

348.92 361.33 B: well i've thought about going back because uh they treat registered nurses differently if you're an associates degree or you're a bachelors degree you both have to take the exact same state board exam but you're not treated the same 

358.42 359.39 A: uh-huh 

359.40 360.31 A: (( yeah )) 

361.10 362.08 A: (( really you )) 

362.17 367.58 A: see my wife came out she she got her associates worked for six months and then went on to get her b._s._n. 

362.25 363.09 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

367.79 375.23 A: and then she was able to go and she did management in the home health agency and so she never really had the whole hospital with a b._s._n. 

375.13 377.87 B: i've never worked in a hospital either i do home health care too 

377.47 378.58 A: oh you do 

378.39 381.45 B: but now lately i have been considering going to a hospital 

381.10 384.35 A: yeah oh well that's interesting 

382.75 386.29 B: just because uh kim- home healthcare can be a bit of a butt pain 

386.08 387.44 A: yeah 

387.05 391.46 B: you know you get uh too involved with the patients' families and uh 

391.69 393.20 B: then they uh 

393.45 401.22 B: you know they want things they want you to do things their way and it's like well i'm sorry but i have to follow the doctor's orders and they don't wanna hear it 

399.25 400.20 A: uh-huh 

401.02 402.32 A: (( oh )) 

402.50 410.43 A: well yeah i mean right now is a great time to go back to school i mean there's a lot of incentives in texas even some hospitals i've heard that'll pay for you to go back to come back and work for them 

410.04 411.02 B: oh really 

410.66 412.23 A: (( yeah well when we )) 

411.12 415.11 B: yeah we got some tuition reimbursement stuff up here if you wanna go to the big city but 

415.17 418.36 B: that's like an hour's drive and i i don't know about it 

417.46 418.82 A: and where are you from again 

418.70 421.31 B: um halfway between rochester and buffalo 

420.96 424.74 A: oh okay we my wife and i were out there just a year and a half ago 

424.95 432.87 A: we were out towards uh well we went through uh rochester and we went down through palmilla and kinda over towards ohio after that 

431.78 433.25 B: mhm yeah 

433.38 438.10 B: yeah my brother in law goes that way every week he's a truck driver he goes to kansas city 

435.71 436.36 A: (( it's )) 

436.39 438.86 A: a beautiful beautiful area you live in 

438.82 442.13 B: yes it's very nice i was out in utah once 

440.23 441.18 A: especially in 

441.83 443.30 A: really where which part 

442.24 450.41 B: i used to take my grandma to las vegas and every year we'd go and every year we'd pick a different state to drive through from las vegas 

445.16 446.13 A: oh really 

448.40 449.74 A: [noise] 

450.24 451.68 A: well that's a good idea 

450.76 457.04 B: just to look around you know we went up we made it up to into utah and looked around some state park that was there and then drove back 

451.90 452.72 A: uh-huh 

456.62 462.57 A: [laughter] well yeah southern utah's got some beautiful state parks really are 

462.23 466.54 B: this one was pretty cool it had this hanging valley on the side of some mountain it was really neat 

466.25 468.47 A: huh well that's kinda cool 

468.16 473.01 B: on the bottom corner i think you know near las vegas it couldn't be hard to find 

472.45 475.85 A: yeah it might be zions or uh arches or one of those two 

477.42 480.85 A: well neat well i don't know if there's anything else we gotta talk about 

480.25 483.02 B: well you have to talk until they tell you to stop 

482.45 484.21 A: oh okay 

483.04 487.84 B: and it's been almost eight minutes so it shouldn't be too much longer i've 

487.01 489.43 A: well do you have any chil- and what what's your name again 

489.04 490.01 B: jennifer 

489.64 491.26 A: jennifer do you have any children 

490.87 493.88 B: nope nope i have twelve nieces and nephews i think 

493.01 494.94 A: oh hey well that's great 

493.92 497.68 B: you wanna kid to spoil you borrow one of them spoil 'em rotten and give 'em back 

496.96 503.94 A: [laughter] actually that's the way to go because my son if i spoil him he just cries and cries and i have nothing else to i mean you wanna give him back to 

503.77 511.46 B: [laughter] well i my sister does home schooling so she doesn't have the problem with uh schools banning books or anything like that 

504.87 505.73 A: (( so )) 

510.18 513.93 A: yeah what do you think about home schooling that's an a an issue i'm 

512.82 514.48 B: it's a good idea really 

514.20 515.84 A: it's a good idea 

515.24 520.30 B: i think so because um my niece according to my niece she's fifteen 

520.44 530.32 B: and she says she was talking to her friends up in school the other day and her according to her friends she is not the only one that is not on drugs or alcohol in the entire class 

528.66 529.69 A: wow 

530.00 531.03 A: wow 

530.67 535.11 B: and this is a semi rural school avon new york it's not the big city 

532.84 534.00 A: (( that's amazing )) 

535.30 536.16 A: (( ugh )) 

535.60 542.10 B: and they seem to think that everybody in that class is either taking drugs or drinking alcohol 

541.60 543.07 A: that's horrible 

542.58 546.20 B: and becca is home schooled so she has no access to any of that stuff mhm 

545.53 553.21 A: yeah my only concern with home school is i had a a friend who's fairly intelligent he and i went through school and then he left in eighth grade went to home schooling [noise] 

553.57 560.55 A: he didn't have the self-discipline to kinda do the homework and i don't think his mother who was home schooling him really pushed it as much 

560.59 568.53 A: and so he got behind and then he was also socially he's kinda outta whack when he came back his senior year to kinda try to do catch up he 

568.51 580.48 A: he didn't know how to handle certain situations with people because he'd been sheltered at home for so long so i guess there's you have the flip side for both of it i'd love to guard my children from all the junk that's out there but at the same time they need 

572.73 573.78 B: yeah 

579.60 588.21 B: well there's also home school groups like she takes the kids to home school group every thursday where they have like a gym class an art class and a music class 

583.91 584.75 A: oh 

587.91 589.30 A: oh that's good 

588.71 591.25 B: so they do get to interact with other kids 

590.69 591.59 A: uh-huh 

591.78 597.30 B: but they don't have the uh you know problems with being alone up at the school all day and 

596.60 598.15 A: exactly 

597.49 598.92 B: stuff like that 

598.36 599.89 A: well i'm sure she'd be a
