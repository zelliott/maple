6.61 7.81 B: and um what do you think 

8.86 9.71 A: um 

9.92 14.04 A: i'm uh actually i'm a student at um a freshman in college right now 

14.60 15.85 A: and uh 

16.21 20.30 A: i think that like the minimum wage i don't know it i think it depends on like where you're living 

20.56 25.16 A: because like i live in connecticut and i unders- like it's the the um 

25.78 34.33 A: it's why it's really expensive to live in connecticut and like a lot of my friends get paid a lot of money and if i was like making the minimum wage um compared to them like 

34.67 36.78 A: i wouldn't really like i don't know 

37.00 40.34 A: um and my other friend i have a friend that lives in oregon and like 

41.20 47.54 A: they get paid like the minimum wage there for like regular jobs but like pay like eight and nine dollars where i live 

48.53 49.25 A: so 

49.68 50.28 A: i don't know 

50.82 54.47 A: but it it doesn't matter as much there because everyone gets paid the same 

54.82 55.49 A: what about you 

56.26 58.22 B: i think it's probably 

58.85 61.66 B: sufficient as long people realize it's minimum 

61.78 62.29 B: wage 

63.08 66.41 B: and that people really don't try to take advantage of other people by 

66.70 67.57 B: keeping them at that 

67.88 68.81 B: too long a time 

69.87 71.61 B: especially people who have families 

72.06 74.88 B: and can't afford to live on five dollars and ten cents an hour 

76.60 78.11 A: where uh where are you from 

78.76 79.15 B: florida 

79.92 80.42 A: florida 

80.65 80.99 B: uh huh 

82.13 82.62 A: um 

83.96 88.96 A: i don't like do you know like a lot of jobs that get paid minimum wage that like aren't waitressing like 

89.65 91.87 B: well an awful lot of uh 

93.20 94.64 B: well like uh 

95.58 100.15 B: apprentice jobs where there's someone who's just coming into the workforce and learning a job 

100.39 102.44 B: a lot of service jobs are like that 

103.12 104.24 B: a lot of uh 

104.38 104.96 B: i think 

105.42 108.52 B: mcdonald's and burger king et cetera et cetera 

109.08 111.53 B: think that most of those start out at the minimum wage 

111.97 112.42 A: really 

112.45 112.96 B: yep 

114.30 115.88 A: do you think that's just the florida thing 

114.47 114.73 B: (( )) 

116.59 118.90 B: no i think this is pretty wild widespread 

119.82 121.50 A: cause i think that um 

122.16 125.04 A: people that started working at mcdonald's up where i live 

125.19 127.88 A: probably start at like seven dollars maybe 

128.32 128.76 B: oh 

129.94 130.84 B: well i suppose that 

130.98 133.03 B: depends on the part of the country you're from then 

133.47 137.32 A: yeah i i really don't feel like that there's any jobs around where i live that 

137.48 140.22 A: pay minimum wage except for waitressing and they 

140.32 142.68 A: pay minimum wage just because you get tips 

144.49 145.89 A: and uh it makes up for it 

146.18 148.52 B: well actually waitress and waiter jobs 

148.65 149.08 B: pay less 

150.21 151.26 B: and that that's because 

150.72 152.01 A: than less than minimum wage 

152.12 152.42 B: yes 

153.64 155.42 A: i don't know i didn't know that 

154.91 156.50 B: because they make it up in tips 

157.59 157.96 A: right 

157.98 160.71 B: a lot of um jobs related to 

163.23 164.95 B: tourist industry are that way 

165.63 166.04 A: mhm 

165.97 169.83 B: they pay less because they expect you to be able to make it up in tips 

170.77 172.57 B: and some people really like those jobs 

172.89 174.42 B: for the very reason that their 

174.56 176.10 B: tips usually are pretty good 

176.82 179.15 B: and they get paid according to the service they give 

180.09 182.46 B: instead of just um the number of hours they work 

183.51 184.09 A: how 

184.36 186.65 A: have you waitered or waitressed before 

186.97 187.69 B: oh yeah 

187.06 187.77 A: like how 

188.39 189.29 B: yeah i've done that 

188.65 189.07 A: what 

190.47 191.33 B: been there done that 

192.09 194.74 A: how below minimum wage do they pay 

194.99 197.74 B: you know i don't even remember because it's been too long ago 

198.48 198.83 A: hm 

198.86 199.38 B: um 

200.05 204.23 B: actually when i was doing that the minimum wage was twenty five cents an hour 

206.38 207.72 A: really wow 

209.00 209.44 A: that (( )) 

209.06 209.35 B: yeah

228.18 233.60 A: um yeah my grandpa's um like seventy six or something and he was trying to get me the 

233.72 235.62 A: teach him how to use the internet 

236.04 236.47 A: but 

237.18 237.55 A: yeah 

238.20 241.53 A: that's great it's crazy how like much the minimum wage has changed 

241.99 244.35 B: oh yeah and it hasn't really kept up with 

245.06 247.11 B: the way things are in society 

247.94 248.33 B: um 

249.19 252.40 B: i had a business for years and i would hire people 

252.97 254.26 B: who were totally untrained 

255.05 256.48 B: and at the time 

257.73 261.35 B: (( )) of minimum wage was around three dollars or three and a quarter 

262.41 264.15 B: and i never paid anybody that 

264.73 267.26 B: no one can survive on on a 

267.86 268.87 B: very low wage 

269.56 270.00 A: yeah 

270.70 272.48 B: right now five ten an hour 

272.96 275.00 B: i don't see how they can survive on that 

275.91 276.39 A: yeah 

277.25 279.27 A: that's i yeah i know what you mean 

279.44 279.82 A: (( )) 

280.57 282.54 A: do you think it's not keeping up with inflation 

284.52 287.37 B: well uh actually i'm not one to 

288.37 288.75 B: tout 

288.98 292.15 B: minimum wage i think people need to be paid what they're worth 

293.07 297.17 B: and um for some people that five ten an hour paid more than they're worth 

298.74 300.36 B: five ten an hour being robbed 

301.66 301.98 A: hm 

302.50 303.07 B: i don't like 

306.04 307.59 B: people need to be paid what they're worth 

308.94 310.93 A: what about for jobs that 

311.08 313.33 A: um don't really require uh 

313.55 314.13 A: a lot of 

314.77 315.18 A: work 

315.45 316.20 B: a lot of skill 

316.51 318.15 A: yeah that's the (( )) 

317.61 319.11 B: sometimes 

319.81 322.03 B: eh the government interferes with that too 

322.11 323.51 B: and eh they they 

324.13 325.33 B: don't give children 

325.74 326.37 B: young kids 

326.88 330.19 B: an opportunity to learn and and uh develop skills 

330.89 331.95 B: like in florida 

332.23 333.40 B: they uh if you're 

333.77 334.95 B: under sixteen 

335.57 336.18 B: and you want to 

336.31 338.09 B: get a job you have to have your parent 

338.20 338.63 B: sign 

340.08 342.67 B: sign a they sign a waiver allowing you to work 

343.41 343.82 A: right 

344.48 347.88 B: and you're not allowed to do certain things you're not allowed to (( )) 

348.36 352.48 B: actually the thing says you're not allowed to wrestle alligators but who does that anyway 

353.31 354.37 B: and um but 

354.55 356.51 B: the whole thing boils down to 

356.61 357.14 B: um 

357.50 360.14 B: we need to have a way for people to learn 

360.82 362.45 B: a skill or job 

363.29 364.92 B: and and we don't need to put 

365.20 366.09 B: binders on 'em 

367.70 369.67 B: when i was young i worked in the steel mill 

370.17 370.73 B: sixteen 

371.64 372.01 A: hm 

371.92 372.65 B: and um 

373.40 374.57 B: i didn't hurt me 

375.67 379.32 B: and i think a lot of people and i'm earn i earned a very good wage 

379.77 382.58 B: the minimum wage was fifty cents then 

383.23 385.72 B: my minimum wage was a dollar twenty four 

386.32 386.70 A: wow 

387.26 389.53 B: so you know i got paid for what i did 

389.94 390.32 A: right 

394.62 395.54 B: and we ought to make the (( )) 

395.69 396.10 B: -tunities 

398.54 399.01 B: minimum 

400.61 403.49 B: only says that this is the least we should pay 

405.63 406.72 B: not necessarily 

407.62 408.68 B: an indication of what 

408.86 410.25 B: we should be paying 

411.22 412.47 B: the minimum that we should 

413.44 414.58 B: according to law pay 

415.57 415.96 B: so 

416.29 417.12 B: consequently 

418.48 423.63 B: people who start in an industry or a job let's say you started as a maid in a 

428.73 429.44 A: housekeepers 

428.94 429.27 B: -tel 

429.69 431.51 B: yeah in a ho- in a motel 

430.44 430.73 A: oh 

431.87 432.25 A: mhm 

432.32 436.48 B: you have certain amount of work you have to get finished everyday 

436.98 438.08 B: at a certain time 

439.41 442.21 B: and if you're really good at it then you can do more than that 

443.95 444.28 B: do 

444.36 445.32 B: uh and you 

445.44 447.93 B: have the opportunity to do that you ought to be paid for it 

448.75 449.15 A: right 

450.17 452.34 A: so you think that a lot of pe- a lot of 

452.50 455.02 A: um places take advantage of the minimum wage 

455.22 455.67 B: i do 

457.50 458.65 B: and i think it's wrong 

459.18 459.86 B: think um 

459.35 460.64 A: right 

461.34 462.10 A: well i agree 

461.36 462.13 B: but that's see this 

462.26 462.55 B: it 

462.69 463.04 B: it 

463.25 464.11 B: build in greed 

464.81 465.22 B: um 

465.98 469.59 B: if you give somebody the opportunity to take advantage of somebody else 

470.44 470.99 B: sometimes 

473.19 473.63 A: right 

475.76 477.82 B: mandate by law away 

479.16 479.71 B: five dollars 

483.36 484.76 B: greedy you're going to pay you that 

485.71 486.00 A: right 

487.92 489.49 B: you maybe worth a whole lot more but 

488.23 488.55 A: what 

489.63 492.08 B: the law only says five ten so you 

493.74 494.09 A: right 

495.18 498.43 A: what about um like competing businesses though that need 

498.54 499.39 A: employers 

500.79 502.80 A: like they're going to offer more right 

503.72 505.96 B: sometimes that depends on the job market 

506.96 512.50 B: uh right now in florida i think a lot of people would be glad to work for five dollars and ten cents an hour
