0.61 2.47 A: hello hi 

2.44 4.64 B: hi i'm lindsey what's your name 

5.36 9.23 A: i'm ed diskowski in durham north carolina 

8.67 12.02 B: oh i'm in dallas texas so pretty far down 

11.85 15.78 A: i c- i can't i i'm a little hard of hearing i can't hear you 

15.70 18.67 B: oh i'm sorry i said i'm in dallas texas 

18.34 19.62 A: oh okay 

20.18 21.37 B: uh so 

20.71 24.34 A: i didn't quite get what the subject was could you tell me 

23.77 32.03 B: um it's censorship in the schools do you feel that public or private schools have the right to ban books 

31.62 32.51 A: oh 

33.72 37.73 B: or no not the right to ban books but have the right to restrict reading i think 

37.10 38.39 A: oh okay 

39.30 40.21 B: (( [noise] you know )) 

39.41 40.89 A: well i 

40.91 42.95 A: i don't think 

43.11 51.13 A: public schools have a right to restrict reading but private schools i guess can do what they want [laughter] 

49.88 52.17 B: [noise] i guess so it depends on i guess 

52.33 58.43 B: the only thing i would say is that the private schools are receiving funding like federal funding then they need to 

58.69 60.23 B: you know keep their 

60.65 63.40 B: (( i don't know themselves in line )) 

61.68 69.57 A: okay i'll agree with you there if if they're getting public public funding then they should not be able to restrict i'm in favor of 

70.23 72.87 A: more the more information you have the better 

73.07 75.03 A: so we should open 

75.93 76.90 A: uh 

76.66 77.71 B: yeah 

77.98 83.18 B: [mn] i agree with that to the most for the most part it just seems like they're so 

78.08 79.29 A: (( everything should be [lipsmack] )) 

84.70 91.77 B: there's so many books out there and i am not a fan of censorship in general um but at the same time i think if i were to have children 

92.17 102.20 B: i would be a little bit wary if they came home and were reading something that i and i don't know what that would be particularly um that i would find really offensive but i 

101.47 107.72 A: oh yeah that yeah it has to be appropriate for the children's age of course i i agree i agree with 

102.76 103.78 B: (( know )) 

105.41 107.52 B: (( right i mean )) 

107.81 115.27 B: you know at berkley they study the you know the poetry of tupac shakur you know rappers and i kind of just have to 

115.66 122.05 B: that's fine it's you know it's college and i think it should be in a pub- at a private college instead of a public one but 

122.26 131.09 B: you know as long as my kid isn't coming home doing something that i find highly offensive i think it's good for them to to read and also to learn why 

131.46 140.58 B: to find out why things are banned because a lot of the times i really have no idea why a book was banned uh it's like the people that ban the harry potter books 

141.19 144.60 B: i find that insane [laughter] i find that really crazy 

141.37 142.00 A: (( you )) 

143.03 144.08 A: oh really 

144.24 146.76 A: harry potter's been banned [laughter] 

146.15 154.78 B: well a lot of people don't like harry pot- a lot of um very conservative people don't like harry potter because he um 

154.81 160.12 B: because it talks about witchcraft and sorcery and things like that but 

156.61 157.89 A: oh i well 

160.87 164.46 A: but it's but it's just a fairytale sort of 

160.88 161.95 B: which 

164.05 172.03 B: yeah oh i agree and i think that i mean i've read the harry potter books i think they're they're very well written and they're good stories and you know i'm 

171.81 180.03 B: like you it's not profane and whatever gets the kids interested in reading it's a lot better than most most of what's on t._v. so 

179.56 180.43 A: right 

180.47 181.58 B: (( you know )) 

180.59 189.15 A: yeah i remember when i was a kid i i used to read uh fantasy books that weren't necessarily true to life but i enjoyed them 

189.07 190.65 B: oh yeah 

189.82 192.05 A: i remember reading about brer rabbit 

192.29 193.66 B: oh yes 

193.09 194.87 A: [laughter] i 

193.95 197.00 B: i think actually brer rabbit has been banned 

196.91 197.81 A: pardon 

197.94 204.19 B: i think that was that's been banned i the uncle remus uncle remus has been banned 

199.69 200.79 A: (( oh you do )) 

202.31 204.72 A: yeah uncle remus right 

204.30 210.91 B: mhm uncle remus has been banned because it portrays african americans in a 

210.94 213.37 B: light that is not appropriate 

211.84 212.74 A: oh 

212.84 214.63 A: i see oh okay 

213.81 223.44 B: but i yeah i grew up on them i never thought of it that way i just thought of uncle remus as uncle remus but i think that sometimes stuff like that makes you more think more about 

218.81 220.12 A: yeah right 

224.27 228.34 B: makes you think of things in a light that's really not good that you never thought about before 

227.78 228.99 A: yeah 

228.48 230.12 B: yu- which is sad 

230.46 232.05 B: but and like 

231.06 231.86 A: (( yeah i [mn] )) 

231.88 235.72 A: i think people tend to take things to extreme sometimes 

232.07 233.14 B: yeah 

235.13 241.35 B: oh i think so too i think that most of the time what they talk about is are things going to extremes 

241.42 244.01 B: and but 

244.02 249.18 B: most- mostly i don't have a problem with it if it's if it's really 

249.38 253.18 B: if it's age appropriate i don't have a problem with it i wouldn't want 

252.77 253.63 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] okay )) 

253.45 260.84 B: you know ten year old children reading the catcher in the rye where he's spouting out this and that every second but 

261.17 263.53 B: you know if you're in high school and you 

263.64 266.20 B: hear that left and right anyway 

266.38 271.61 B: you know i mean i think that they shouldn't have to read it but i don't think it should be banned 

271.92 272.91 B: (( you know )) 

272.56 274.21 A: well i pretty much agree with you 

274.80 279.18 B: yeah i think most people are kinda like that just 

279.33 282.38 B: uh i think it would be interesting to talk to someone who really 

282.65 283.56 B: felt 

283.67 285.62 B: really one way or the other 

285.84 288.18 B: most people are pretty middle of the road 

289.57 290.75 A: yeah 

290.95 300.08 B: i would wonder what it would be [mn] so it'd be interesting to see what people would think but at the same time i don't even have children so i don't know how that would affect 

300.37 301.89 B: you know my point of view 

301.63 305.93 A: yeah we don't have children either so it hasn't been a problem for us 

305.69 306.95 B: right 

307.38 313.59 B: and i wonder it's it's funny i talked to a lady earlier that had children and but she she pretty much felt the same way she said that 

313.71 321.04 B: one time her kids in high school came home with a permission slip to watch an r. rated movie and she didn't think that that was appropriate 

320.61 321.70 A: say it again 

321.08 327.38 B: for them um her children came home once with a permission slip to watch an r. rated movie 

326.79 328.27 A: (( oh oh okay )) 

327.83 331.02 B: and she th- she didn't think that that was appropriate and 

331.13 331.95 B: (( you know )) 

332.67 337.22 B: i don't know if i would have had a problem with it or not but i guess it would have the movie 

336.82 339.36 A: uh huh well i guess it would depend on the book 

339.23 342.03 B: that as well [laughter] so 

340.13 341.06 A: yeah 

342.51 344.49 B: but there's so much 

344.54 353.82 B: and culturally even i mean we were talking about there's so much violence in american society that's considered just completely appropriate 

353.74 362.85 A: yeah i i don't like violence i don't even like watching violence on on television i won't g- i don't go to violent movies 

353.93 355.16 B: and 

362.84 370.58 A: but i think life should be enjoyable and i don't i don't get any fun out of watching people get hurt 

371.01 372.44 B: oh me neither 

373.21 376.74 B: it's crazy that that seems so appropriate but yet 

377.04 383.22 B: you know coarse language or you know sexual situations people have this huge problem with 

383.10 384.31 A: yeah 

383.70 385.66 B: when to me that's 

385.68 389.20 B: more natural than the violence 

387.83 388.76 A: (( yeah i )) 

388.79 398.31 A: i don't object to coarse language since that's that's real life uh if pe- if that's the way people talk well uh why can't we accept it 

393.93 395.41 B: mhm 

396.66 397.73 B: yeah 

398.46 399.78 A: but uh i don't 

401.12 402.24 A: enjoy 

402.48 404.98 A: violence just for violence sake [lipsmack] 

406.86 409.66 B: (( no i don't know but i i think whenever )) 

409.60 422.72 B: i do have kids i will still read them uncle remus [lipsmack] [laughter] and i will read i will read them little black sambo was the other one that was that was banned that was for young children 

412.99 415.46 A: yes good [laughter] 

421.08 423.66 A: oh yeah i remember about that one yeah 

423.04 429.59 B: i remember little black sambo if i can find a copy of little black sambo i will read little black sambo because i love little black sambo 

429.78 432.18 B: and you know just 

432.28 442.78 B: so many things that just and they will get harry potter and they will get the oz books and the chronicles of narnia and just all of those 

442.82 443.75 B: so 

444.00 447.25 B: i can't imagine limiting my children that way 

447.19 449.26 A: yeah okay good 

448.31 450.65 B: but to your expense 

451.00 452.27 B: (( uh )) 

453.18 455.97 B: so how did you end up doing this survey 

456.57 458.87 A: how did i get get involved 

458.30 459.68 B: mhm 

458.97 461.82 A: oh let's see i think i saw
