499.98 501.31 B: it's um 

501.40 508.24 B: from when i talk to people they always say you have to exercise a little bit before you work your way into that class because 

507.45 510.53 A: yeah you can't just do it as a beginner 

508.40 509.50 B: you sometimes 

510.19 512.66 B: yeah sometimes the instructors 

511.53 515.62 A: like start out with a routine at the gym and then work your way up it [laughter] 

513.82 514.90 B: mhm 

514.92 523.45 B: yeah they because it exercises your arms and your legs they say you have to kind of get used to kind of be a little coordinated too [laughter] to keep up with all the different exercises 

522.94 524.33 A: that sounds fun though 

524.13 533.76 B: mhm there's some people at the gym i go to they're i mean they're older like in their sixties and they're doing the spinning it's and i'm thinking i can't even do that [laughter]

535.66 537.41 B: do you run or anything 

537.37 543.32 A: no i i never was much of a runner like i was running i don't like i'm not like i told you because i'm in an apartment 

543.09 544.05 B: mhm 

543.50 548.99 A: i don't just like there's not like a neighborhood neighborhood to run out like 'cause there's like a busy street right there

573.45 579.93 B: not do that not hurt it and so i guess with the roller blades because you've got the ankle support it doesn't hurt as much so 

579.09 579.94 A: yeah 

580.61 582.98 A: i used to play soccer for like five years
