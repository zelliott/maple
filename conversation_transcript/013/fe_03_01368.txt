8.07 9.25 B: like yeah 

9.88 14.82 B: censorship [mn] um i think it can lead to to even 

14.37 16.49 A: um neither do i 

15.14 17.62 B: more ills and and woes 

17.91 21.79 B: and control that we don't want to have i think 

21.86 22.85 B: that 

23.46 33.81 B: reading can help develop a sense of responsibility if those communication lines are kept open and nurtured and when kids are reading 

34.45 37.61 B: [mn] they're encouraged to ask questions and to 

36.20 38.47 A: correct um 

37.99 42.81 B: talk about things that trouble them or concern them or the things that they like or 

39.96 46.49 A: about the only thing i might disagree upon is um if it's um 

46.82 48.56 A: used in a harmful way 

60.61 62.25 B: yeah i guess we can 

62.61 68.58 B: all do our part because it's a it's a topic that comes up from time to time 

64.47 65.64 A: (( [noise] correct )) 

69.41 72.25 B: and i know that as taxpayers 

73.05 74.72 B: we have 

75.18 79.74 B: a say in what happens in th- our public our local public school system 

80.51 83.02 B: i don't have any children in school 

83.97 89.54 B: i think parents of children who are in school have even more power and more say 

87.37 91.76 A: right and it it it's a ban uh uh like a book club or 

90.05 93.96 B: in things like censorship or no censorship 

93.99 95.08 A: oh okay 

97.74 100.41 B: they're like the stake holders in this whole thing 

98.92 99.90 A: oh 

114.34 115.44 A: correct 

129.05 130.77 A: mhm 

135.40 137.05 B: exactly 

137.68 144.16 B: and and i just hate to think of the way it it snowballs out of control and uh you know uh 

144.34 145.19 B: these 

146.19 158.42 B: people go out and start burning things and having these bonfires and throwing books on 'em and you know that's what scares me it it turns into like a mob scene a 

157.97 158.70 A: mm 

158.70 164.84 A: [lipsmack] well i know uh growing up myself um we probably were restricted though 

164.84 173.82 A: in reading from a private school more than we were restricted when i entered a public school system 

174.09 175.90 A: so um 

176.16 180.91 A: therefore i went to the public school system because i had the freedom to 

177.73 179.03 B: exactly 

179.53 181.25 B: and the only way 

181.15 182.97 A: choose what books i wanted 

181.41 190.39 B: anything can be accomplished is to talk about it not to you know form an angry mob and burn and and destroy 

182.98 185.70 A: and at the private school we were not 

190.54 195.20 B: but rather be creative and and communicate 

195.88 197.33 A: mhm 

197.60 210.42 A: but then but then they also didn't um because it was a private school it was um more religious an- based so you had um the freedom to read anything pertaining to 

210.82 211.62 A: (( uh )) 

212.36 212.99 A: (( uh )) 

213.21 214.89 A: religious um 

215.50 224.20 A: medias and able to read uh freely and teachers were teaching a religion class at that time 

253.61 257.64 A: yeah we used to say the pledge of allegiance every day or daily 

257.94 261.16 A: and i believe that is ruled out now [laughter] 

265.64 267.19 A: so mm 

267.87 269.45 A: right correct 

270.08 273.28 A: choose to and if and i do know um 

273.38 274.50 A: um 

275.05 281.44 A: children here in our area that go to the private schools um they might not be that um 

281.56 293.81 A: um religion but they are able to um freely choose what books they read um at their school but in [mn] but in the other 

293.82 305.47 A: essence at the public schools um it's you have more freedom to read whatever you want to read in the public schools there's a lot more freedom there than the private school sector 

308.84 314.06 A: and i went to both and i have brothers and sisters that went to all private 

314.29 317.59 A: and there was only two of us allowed to go to the public 

318.14 321.45 A: because our parents thought that was less of an education 

321.94 324.23 A: but yeah we turned out pretty good 

324.36 325.64 A: [laughter] 

351.44 356.61 A: [noise] correct my my parents definitely encouraged reading um we were giving 

356.69 360.79 A: given more play time if we read more books and and um 

360.77 373.40 A: when my mother let us go to the public library or little book store she did not uh she wanted to see the books but she didn't she never said no you can't read that mhm 

374.04 379.34 A: so um um we grew up reading and being awarded for reading 

381.02 382.29 A: yeah 

398.56 404.01 A: so did my brother and he was given an award for reading about every book that they had in the library 

404.58 409.50 A: so but that's that was eight years of school so you could about read every book 

412.57 418.10 A: so [sigh] uh [laughter] 

448.55 455.57 A: correct yeah any time you read um you have that uh freedom and new possibilities and more knowledge 

456.03 464.41 A: um so i i disagree on censoring um reading materials in the school system 

478.20 479.28 A: correct 

488.75 490.59 A: mhm 

500.25 501.38 A: correct 

502.20 505.33 A: um [mn] 

508.29 514.82 A: yes and when we were going to school my mother was active in the uh school system and p._t._a.s and 

515.00 517.16 A: uh parental guidance 

517.20 518.77 A: and um 

518.82 520.94 A: i know that 

520.96 525.62 A: we didn't have um a a censoring of 

525.69 529.08 A: of books when i was going through the system 

529.12 531.43 A: um and today i would 

531.85 541.96 A: uh hope that our children and the children children after that would be able to uh freely read and be able to give that knowledge to someone else 

549.33 550.48 A: [noise] 

564.22 578.32 A: right because one person's [sigh] attitude towards one piece of uh information from a book should be banned and if you congregate ten people um 

579.34 583.52 A: and they all disagree then who's really right 

596.55 597.64 A: (( correct ))
