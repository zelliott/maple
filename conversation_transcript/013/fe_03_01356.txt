150.72 151.57 B: (( about [laughter] but )) 

154.10 155.35 A: were doing you know 

155.43 156.27 A: uh 

156.11 160.94 B: (( i think that was probably an inappropriate book in that grade to )) 

156.35 157.16 A: so 

161.92 166.12 B: (( have [laughter] at school but i still you know i still wouldn't want someone telling ))

171.56 172.32 B: (( in )) 

173.24 174.02 B: (( school )) 

174.44 179.86 B: (( i i actually i got upset when she was called to the office because someone said you know she was making )) 

180.10 182.62 B: (( fun of them or or gonna tell a story about )) 

181.87 183.65 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

182.71 186.81 B: (( them or something i'm just really um i don't know i'm non censorship i guess mm )) 

186.71 187.95 A: i think so 

186.83 188.32 B: (( uh if you )) 

190.10 192.88 B: (( sp- put your child in a private school )) 

192.90 200.63 B: (( they're probably gonna have rules that say i guess i wouldn't put them in if they said this is a list of books or something )) 

202.17 203.06 B: (( to )) 

204.80 206.99 B: (( that effect you're child can't read )) 

204.90 205.92 A: yeah 

206.57 210.05 A: i i well i i agree i agree and and uh 

210.21 215.99 A: i think so may- wonder if it would be different for us thinking that way if it's 

217.37 218.51 A: (( a )) 

220.14 221.58 A: private school 

229.36 237.07 A: yeah but if they're in a private school does the private school have the right to say 

231.67 232.55 B: right 

237.72 238.79 A: uh 

240.07 243.02 A: you can't read this i i still don't think so 

242.81 252.00 B: i don't i s- i don't see how they even could enforce it unless it's you can't read this at school or bring this book to school how what is to stop a child from reading a book you know anywhere else 

251.79 253.49 A: yeah yeah that makes sense 

252.45 258.16 B: and i went i grew up in private schools and went to a private christian college and um 

258.30 272.58 B: yeah i'd stop i was never ever confronted with that now we have i live in a very conservative area of the state of michigan and every once in a while something'll come up like uh we had in a in a city very close to ours basically a a suburb of grand rapids that 

272.68 273.80 B: um 

273.88 284.98 B: a father was all upset about a steinbeck novel i think it was of mice and men and he thought the racist um things were unnecessary and so it you know were censored and everything and 

278.91 280.40 A: (( uh huh-uh huh-uh )) 

284.88 289.56 B: you can't take a great piece of literature like that and say the whole you know 

289.66 295.64 B: class the whole school can't read it because one parent finds it offensive you know it's just not 

295.35 296.93 A: yeah because you'd never 

295.70 297.77 B: it's not fair [laughter] 

297.14 297.93 A: no 

297.99 310.94 A: and additionally it's it's like you were saying that particular book or any of steinbook -beck's and i guess i've been reading the paper they've been banning some schools somewhere had been banning you know certain books i just don't believe 

309.67 311.20 B: or harry potter even they're 

311.11 315.80 A: yeah yeah and i don't believe that oh gosh yeah i heard that i forgot that 

311.59 313.00 B: (( also banning harry potter )) 

314.67 319.69 B: and i mean can you imagine with all the things going on in the world they're worried about kids reading harry potter 

319.70 320.67 B: (( i mean [laughter] )) 

319.94 320.95 A: i know 

321.33 324.51 A: it seems like their priorities are kinda messed up or something 

324.21 328.27 B: right i know i don't know what they're really trying to achieve with that but 

324.61 325.42 A: uh 

327.56 330.18 A: yeah well i've heard that uh 

330.48 331.50 A: uh 

332.28 341.56 A: grand rapids when i was growing up the guy across the street i guess they'd all moved from grand rapids he was a furniture maker a retired yeah which i you know there's a lot around there 

338.48 339.41 B: (( mhm )) 

341.47 342.30 B: (( w- he was )) 

341.59 346.67 A: and they used to they used to tell me how conservative it was the woman uh 

347.05 359.36 A: i guess his daughter taught voice and she was also an also an actress so she was on doing damn yankees and whatever it all was w- you know and i think people they were saying some of the neighbors were 

349.10 350.00 B: (( mhm )) 

351.03 351.96 B: right 

355.45 356.36 B: (( mm yeah )) 

359.17 360.14 B: yeah 

359.49 362.10 A: upset that she would do that 

361.56 363.65 B: yeah i can see that i 

362.83 370.52 A: yeah but it was funny where where i was living in in houston that's where i grew up the people were kinda the same way they said i just can't believe that person is a 

366.89 367.76 B: (( mhm )) 

370.53 371.93 A: (( is a uh )) 

371.98 379.19 A: actress [laughter] you know and you you're like going wow kinda like your harry potter comment you know why would you do it or whatever 

373.29 374.12 B: right 

376.82 386.99 B: right right no we're very very conservative here when i first came up here to go to college because i was raised in florida um i couldn't believe um 

387.04 391.73 B: you know how conservative it was around here n- and and nothing was open on sunday 

391.97 395.50 B: and people just did the whole you know they stayed [noise] home on sunday 

396.58 397.58 A: yeah 

397.10 398.84 B: it did you hear a beep i 

399.47 400.68 A: uh 

400.05 403.53 B: heard like a little beep i hope it's not my battery in my phone [laughter] 

403.81 406.97 A: i didn't and mine was starting to warble uh 

407.12 409.94 A: we're new to cellphones i'm talking on a cellphone and it's 

409.23 410.10 B: uh-huh 

409.98 423.53 A: it just drives me nuts i just think it should be like the regular phone and work all the time and stuff and plus you can be places and it just quits and you're going like you know so anyway that's something but i don't think it was mine it could've been your battery 

411.49 412.48 B: does it 

413.79 414.76 B: right 

418.44 419.52 B: (( oh god it )) 

422.89 427.75 B: could've been because this is the phone that is hooked up to my computer so i don't use it that much 

427.52 433.76 A: that that's the bane of our existence all the batteries running down in in phones it's just it's literally stupid 

429.68 431.90 B: [laughter] i know 

433.39 441.98 B: i know it is you're right well how do you like this so i i'm one of the few people in the world who doesn't have a cellphone because i really don't want anyone calling me right now [laughter] 

442.05 446.62 A: well i i'm with you and it's kinda dumb because my girlfriend got one 

446.34 447.29 B: yeah 

446.91 450.34 A: uh she's starting she started working kind of across town 

450.54 453.55 A: and she doesn't like to ever running out of gas or whatever 

452.97 453.98 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

453.79 465.50 A: well so then it was okay and it was kinda neat to call her if she was at the store or something well then we had verizon it was twenty bucks more and they gave you a free phone twenty bucks more a month 

465.14 466.21 B: (( mhm )) 

465.89 467.96 A: [lipsmack] and we could share the deal 

467.71 468.63 B: okay 

468.00 470.24 A: so i just dropped long distance 

470.10 470.97 B: (( right mm )) 

470.83 485.43 A: and uh with at&t and just use it for long distance plus she and i call uh you know the odd occasion where we're separated doing something you know whatever so i like it but it's also kinda like a ball and chain uh around you you know 

479.98 480.82 B: mhm 

483.80 484.66 B: yeah 

485.19 487.31 B: she can always get a hold of you [laughter] [laughter]

494.46 495.52 B: oh my god 

494.78 504.44 A: they ever did just because of that and they call her you know whatever so [laughter] i think you're cool to keep away from the cellphone not that they're hideously bad but uh 

495.90 497.04 B: (( mhm )) 

499.58 500.65 B: oh my god 

503.96 513.06 B: no no but i mean everyone's always talking on 'em and my daughter well actually she did get one but she ha- she had to pay for it herself the minutes and she didn't keep it up but [noise] 

504.69 505.67 A: yeah 

510.80 511.85 A: uh-huh 

513.27 521.87 A: well i tell you what i'm scared of uh and i am one of those i've answered it in the car two or three i did hear a beep two or three times and it 

522.05 523.06 A: uh 

523.58 530.37 A: then i'm talking and driving and i'm not good at that you know like we all get mad at everybody and so i hate that i wish they would make the law
