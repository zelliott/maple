226.29 237.26 A: [lipsmack] eat i i forgot what her diet was all about but anyway she did a good job whatever she did she got that weight off because that's all she was worried about was you know being able being able to fit back into her old clothes 

236.68 238.59 B: right yeah 

238.56 242.64 A: she got the i did it with her one night and man 

242.90 244.46 A: that was no joke 

244.61 246.70 B: that looks hard 

246.47 247.76 A: [laughter] 

247.62 252.44 B: i don't think i could do that i couldn't i don't i don't have the stamina for that 

249.71 250.58 A: (( right )) 

254.49 255.37 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

255.37 256.65 B: not at all 

257.21 261.21 B: i always think i would like to take up swimming i think that would be a good 

261.69 262.91 A: swimming 

262.31 265.01 B: yeah a good exercise 

265.22 273.60 B: ah but i'm also a big wimp so the pool has to be heated [laughter] because i'm not swimming if it's cold 

269.53 271.24 A: [laughter] 

273.61 275.17 A: [laughter] 

274.50 280.22 B: and i don't swim in the ocean and so it's like yeah that's probably never going to happen either 

280.57 281.78 A: [laughter] 

282.23 283.17 B: mhm 

282.33 283.20 A: (( well )) 

283.61 288.41 B: they say that uh like you know even horseback riding is good exercise 

288.57 291.05 B: so sometimes i try and get out and do that bu 

292.24 293.11 A: who 

292.86 300.65 B: i think if you just if you don't do something on a regular basis just doing it once in a while i guess it doesn't really help at all 

301.34 302.47 A: right 

301.49 305.61 B: i i guess you either need to do it you know or not do it 

306.93 310.68 B: but and so mostly i don't do it 

310.93 311.58 A: [laughter] 

312.32 314.01 B: so how old is the baby 

314.37 318.91 A: um the baby is eight months she'll be nine months on the thirty first 

318.29 322.19 B: oh okay boy that's pretty good it took me 

322.35 328.20 B: it took me a number of months to lose my my baby weight and get back in my jeans [laughter] 

328.11 332.51 A: yes so [mn] that's what i was saying she did good she was committed 

332.58 335.90 A: that was all she was worried about got to get this weight off 

335.92 339.01 A: she was committed to doing that and she did it 

335.94 336.84 B: oh 

339.45 342.12 A: (( now if i could commit myself to uh )) 

342.24 347.94 A: losing my little tummy and gaining a little muscle a little buff buffness 

348.50 349.55 A: [laughter] 

349.09 350.64 B: right 

350.66 352.17 B: i know it's like 

352.19 361.72 B: i could i could use to you know tone up a little bit i don't necessarily need to lose weight but i certainly could use some toning [laughter] 

360.93 362.20 A: right 

361.94 367.07 B: i- i've hit forty and i've noticed that i'm not near as toned as i used to be 

367.20 370.57 B: used to be i didn't have to work out and i stayed you know 

370.34 372.24 A: (( [noise] [noise] right right )) 

370.64 372.47 B: fairly toned but 

372.70 374.26 B: not any more 

374.89 379.57 B: my big problem is it's just the commitment is just making the commitment 

377.87 378.75 A: right 

380.03 384.40 B: they say if you can do it like thirty days in a row then it becomes a habit 

384.89 386.19 B: but um 

386.93 391.35 B: i ah i've never done it for thirty days in a row [laughter] 

390.65 391.70 A: [laughter] 

392.30 397.88 A: (( well i've done it for thirty days in a row and it wasn't a habit for me that's like [mn] when i was in the military i was you )) 

398.08 399.50 A: know always 

400.79 402.29 A: working out 

401.65 402.84 B: right 

402.47 404.33 A: but now you know 

404.69 411.93 A: got a job living out in the suburbs you know and like you say after you get home you just want to relax 

412.34 413.64 A: [laughter] 

412.88 420.53 B: yeah you know and then it's like you know by the time you mow the lawn and do it's like that's it that's all the workout 

420.89 422.01 B: you know 

422.20 423.90 B: i can stand 

426.44 434.84 B: i'm trying to think what else i've done to try to get myself to you know at least be committed to some sort of exercise 

434.86 445.38 B: because i'm sure that i've tried a number of things but i'm not coordinated enough for any of those aerobics or step classes i like trip over my own feet 

445.78 455.67 A: i've done that before but the place i was doing it at this place they called running shoe and they have all these basketball courts but in the mornings they have like aerobics 

456.41 460.53 A: so i was going with a co-worker of mine out there and um 

461.41 472.81 A: it was too far you know way out of the way for me to go out there in the mornings you know five thirty and get up go out there then you have to drive all the way to work you know i have to take a shower of course afterwards 

465.15 466.12 B: oh 

473.15 474.63 A: so it was just too much 

474.81 476.42 B: oh yeah 

475.61 478.33 A: i probably could have found something else closer to work 

478.93 483.56 A: (( i guess i always when i was going out there was because my co-worker invited me out there )) 

484.99 495.01 B: my husband now y- you mentioned basketball now my husband he tries to get out like with the guys you know and at least play some basketball and stuff like that to 

495.11 497.39 B: at least help keep in shape 

497.80 499.66 B: that's always a good thing 

499.67 503.32 A: that's one of my uh favorite sports to play the basketball 

502.53 505.19 B: is it well that's good exercise then 

505.89 511.38 A: yes but but like you say it's a matter of doing it [laughter] 

508.73 518.01 B: well yeah ahah yeah doing it once every six months doesn't really count as you know [laughter] as an exercise regime 

518.35 519.85 A: right 

520.07 530.62 B: we- of course you know they used to say if you just did something three days a week now i i was reading that now they're saying it's like if you really want to be healthy you're supposed to exercise five days a week 

531.48 535.58 B: i'm like oh man i could never exercise five days a week 

537.71 540.22 B: that's just way too much for me 

540.64 545.64 B: i mean i could remotely maybe get one or two days but i could never get five days 

547.08 551.70 B: so i just run up and down the stairs in my house chasing after kids and dogs and 

551.75 556.04 B: anything else that works its way inside and i call that my exercise 

553.20 553.76 A: (( [mn] )) 

555.67 561.68 A: (( [mn] [laughter] i heard that yeah we all need to go for that )) 

561.17 567.82 B: yeah i know i figure i got a three story house it takes me a while to run up and down stairs 

568.84 572.51 B: [laughter] i'm like oh got to go to the basement okay i'll run down the stairs you 

573.34 580.88 B: know they say too that what you should do is like when you go grocery shopping or go to the mall you should instead of parking closest park the furtherest away 

577.73 578.54 A: (( ahah )) 

581.17 589.96 B: so that that way you at least get a little bit of you know exercise walking through the parking lot to go to the mall or [laughter] or whatever 

587.17 588.29 A: [laughter] 

590.59 592.81 A: (( [mn] yes [noise] it sounds logical )) 

593.11 599.89 B: yeah i had a girlfriend who did that i mean she took every you know it's like she didn't necessarily get to the gym a lot
