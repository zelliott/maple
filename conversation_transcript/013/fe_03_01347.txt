0.10 1.39 B: tiffany 

1.16 2.42 A: billy 

9.47 11.55 A: [noise] i don't know what we're supposed to do 

11.41 13.02 B: (( i don't either [laughter] )) 

12.48 14.07 A: good that's two of us 

14.75 17.09 A: are we supposed to discuss the topic 

17.28 19.21 B: ah i guess possibly 

19.83 20.78 B: um 

21.99 23.96 A: would you like to go first 

23.42 24.18 B: sure 

24.22 25.05 A: (( okay )) 

24.57 28.54 B: i i feel that the children should be able to read um 

29.44 32.39 B: a vast majority of the items that they would like to read 

32.45 38.44 B: ah things that are like rated rated r. and and items like that i don't believe should be there 

38.60 42.57 B: um i especially feel that if they want to read the bible in school they should be able to 

44.99 50.04 A: well do you feel that because about what it sounded like the question was 

49.91 62.12 A: do you feel like you your child or or if you don't have children your sister brother whoever's children should have to read whatever they put in front of 'em because it sounded like they they're 

62.62 68.53 A: asking also the possibility of if we want your children to read ah 

68.91 77.17 A: like they were doing up in carolina said that reading this the the what was it the ah scriptures of the 

77.16 89.71 A: muslims the koran i believe it is they were going to make that part of the curriculum and they will have to do it do you feel like that they should be able to tell you what they have to read especially when they're children 

78.10 79.05 B: mhm 

80.42 81.30 B: mhm 

90.47 94.87 A: or do you think that it should be more the parent in 

95.14 101.11 A: i mean the parent should have some input should be able to say look if i don't want my children subjected to this 

101.35 103.47 A: that should be my right 

102.72 104.01 B: exactly 

104.20 108.04 B: i think the parent should have have more say so over it 

104.21 105.11 A: (( good )) 

108.02 118.96 A: mhm i don't think the parent should be able to go in and get somebody fired because they don't want to do the same thing but in the same ah 

118.94 123.77 A: same situation i don't think that the schools or the teachers have the 

124.57 129.70 A: force anybody to do something that they shouldn't that they don't want to do 

129.80 130.72 B: that's true 

130.75 134.24 A: i also kind of feel that ah that they don't 

134.75 140.83 A: our people enough input on this i mean because i know when there were kids here 

141.89 150.79 A: we never got a month a month criteria of saying what was going to be subjected what the kids were going to be subjected to 

150.97 153.80 A: to you know be able to have any input you know 

153.99 156.43 A: i mean i know there's so much to do 

156.72 158.72 A: trying to teach children 

158.57 171.53 A: and so much to try and run a school and a classroom they really don't have the time to put everything on the plate in front of parents but i think they ought to have some type of gathering other than the p._t._a. where the parents if they wanted to could go 

171.34 174.17 A: and find out what their kids were going to have put in front of 'em 

175.20 178.46 B: right but then what happens when they deviate from the curriculum 

178.56 182.19 B: you know for unforeseen circumstances or something 

182.50 193.01 A: well i mean it to me it falls back like when i i was a kid in school if you had a a religious preference not to want to cut the frog up you didn't have to 

183.08 183.82 B: (( you know )) 

193.17 194.18 B: oh okay 

194.37 202.14 A: you know i mean it's it's gone from the way out i mean 'cause i know age doesn't matter but i'm um early forties 

202.13 203.19 A: and ah 

203.17 209.70 A: when i even back then when i went to school if you if you said that you really didn't want to do it for that reason 

209.61 219.48 A: you really weren't forced you weren't penalized for it you had to do some other yin yang whatever 'cause i know there was a couple of little girls that got out of doing it by that method 

219.03 220.13 B: [laughter] 

219.80 228.29 A: and um i mean i don't fault 'em for it i mean and whatever method they wanted to do but ah you know i i don't think 

228.46 232.93 A: i think there should be some way to make 'em still 

233.19 236.95 A: get the educational values out of it but you you know 

238.36 250.82 A: i don't know i just i feel like they're trying to they're forcing people into um exploring avenues that they really don't they don't care about they have a hard enough time dealing with their every day life with the 

250.96 252.45 A: the things that they 

252.68 255.37 A: you know need to do and need to take care of 

253.86 260.42 B: yeah have to do in school well how come then so many parents are opting for home schooling 

260.87 267.71 A: well now that helps that the i feel like the reason why they're doing that is because of um 

267.94 269.44 A: it gives ah 

269.97 283.34 A: whichever male or female parent that's that's getting to stay at home it gives them more of a feeling of fulfillment i mean because just being there and running a household that kind of bites but if you're not there 

273.49 274.38 B: uh-huh 

280.85 281.60 B: uh-huh 

284.20 288.70 A: then your child's a latch door or whatever they pass key kid 

288.07 289.12 B: latch key 

288.93 300.68 A: yeah and ah then then the child doesn't have the supervision during those hours when when you can't get away from the job yet or you miss those holidays because of it 

300.52 301.50 B: mhm 

301.15 314.46 A: yeah i i i don't know i mean because i know there was a guy in the neighbourhood right up the street and he worked at i._b._m. and he managed to go ahead and and retire from i._b._m. when his little girl started out in kindergarten 

314.31 320.04 A: and um he was at the school and acting like a a 

320.52 324.31 A: a god what did they used to call them um 

322.89 323.51 B: (( [mn] )) 

324.76 328.92 A: i don't know the parent when a parent went out like a teacher's assistant 

328.71 341.31 A: but ah he was like that and i thought well you know that's got that's got to be great but then when i started hearing about him wanting to impose his ideas and you know 

341.17 345.05 A: get the kids to do the way he wanted to i started thinking to myself wait a minute 

345.04 358.37 A: now i think the teacher needs to be there you know because right now it's just like you know i mean if you send your kid over to your neighbor's house to play you kind of give them the authority to you know say look 

358.41 364.95 A: don't play with my kids do play with my kid you know whatever you do you have given them that that okay 

361.18 362.28 B: mhm 

364.72 365.65 B: mhm 

364.86 375.56 A: who are these parents walking off the street they don't they don't go to school to be educators they don't have to you know they just they walk in the door and they go hey 

375.49 384.16 A: look at me how do you like the way i'm dressed i think i'd like to help out in the classroom i'd like to help out in the gym i'd like to help out in the library 

384.60 388.11 A: i don't know it kind of got i was like wow 

387.98 388.54 B: (( [cough] )) 

389.36 394.51 A: all that kind of worked itself out but nowadays you hear so many um things 

393.32 395.34 B: weird things yeah 

394.65 397.27 A: yeah you don't know if if 

397.92 405.13 A: i don't know you can't there can't be enough watchful eyes on children caring watchful eyes there can't be 

402.01 402.82 B: yeah 

405.29 413.33 A: and i mean i just i have a hard time when i i received questions saying do you believe in um 

414.00 416.61 A: ah conservative values or 

416.70 422.07 A: rebel values and i think to myself well there are parts that there are parts 

421.75 422.61 B: right 

422.59 425.27 A: yeah and and there are some things that are just 

425.32 428.96 A: that just make sense no matter if you're liberal or conservative 

429.22 434.28 A: and it rolls back to that same thing about the about the classrooms and the and the teaching 

434.29 436.14 A: i mean as long as they 

436.59 438.53 A: put enough of a twist on it 

438.78 440.61 A: where they can say look 

440.75 441.87 A: this 

442.09 444.40 A: can be looked at in two different ways 

445.32 450.84 A: you it's it's it's up to you to draw out of it what you're going to get 

450.45 451.31 B: right 

451.38 463.28 A: you know but i'm i'm worried that you know some [noise] some nut can get in there and and say okay well we're going to start we're going to start studying satan because back during medieval times you know 

463.31 464.71 A: like wow 

465.07 467.75 A: coming across that in your kid's homework 

467.70 468.89 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

468.93 471.04 B: yeah that's not a not a good thing 

471.72 473.10 B: no um 

473.20 476.70 B: i [sigh] feel that a lot of people that well 

476.89 481.05 B: the ones that can afford to do so and have the luxury of it i should say 

481.15 489.19 B: are opting for home schooling i mean there is a curriculum you have to follow there are tests that have to be submitted i mean it is state governed 

485.92 486.88 A: mhm 

487.12 488.25 A: mhm 

489.73 501.10 B: but um kids that just can't make it in the school system you know for one reason or another say they're maybe a._d._h._d. or you know some type of learning disability or 

501.50 506.33 B: the parents don't agree with what the public school is teaching them and that type of thing 

505.98 507.15 A: mhm 

506.59 509.32 B: you know what do you do you you 

509.50 515.09 B: [mn] you don't want to keep sending them some place where you know they're not receiving what they need what you feel they need 

514.50 515.69 A: mhm 

515.07 525.01 B: you know um such as reading these books and that book and what not you know [mn] they don't do things like i had back in my school i mean i'm mid thirties 

518.93 520.11 A: mhm 

522.97 523.86 A: right 

524.57 525.78 A: mhm

546.13 547.64 A: mhm 

547.00 550.98 B: you know and then mom has to do it all but i try 

551.23 557.81 B: so my my son has challenges and the teachers are saying you know that he's just 

558.14 564.04 B: sitting there and not learning and not wanting to do anything well he's young you know give him time 

560.86 561.73 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

564.38 568.33 B: [mn] forcing him is not going to help him get to doing it 

568.46 572.64 B: you know reading any faster writing any faster learning his spelling words you know 

573.32 575.20 B: it just doesn't happen 

577.57 580.71 A: yeah well that is where 

581.13 584.30 A: home schooling really would help out a lot because you can 

584.31 598.21 A: you can turn it into more of a game and have it on a reward system and you know just so many other avenues that you can explore that they can't do in school but um when it comes to 

598.32 599.95 A: what they're going to study
