0.69 1.90 A: (( hello )) 

1.42 3.38 B: hi i'm jessie 

3.32 4.87 A: i'm fred 

4.27 5.07 B: hi 

5.93 7.58 A: (( ah so )) 

7.61 11.61 A: no i i don't think that they ah should be ah 

11.96 15.23 A: like made to read certain books i guess 

15.32 18.01 B: well i guess it depends on what kind of book it is 

17.87 18.99 A: yeah 

18.24 20.74 B: i mean if it's really controversial then 

21.12 24.48 B: i mean if it's a public school then i don't think you should 

25.02 26.98 B: but if it's a private school and 

27.14 28.32 B: there's a 

28.52 30.14 B: level of 

31.54 34.83 B: mm well yeah it just depends on the topic of the book 

35.46 39.46 A: [noise] yeah [noise] okay 

39.19 40.19 B: i mean 

40.67 42.91 B: let's say the topic is religion 

43.02 43.84 A: (( ahah )) 

43.60 52.18 B: and if it's not a parochial school or any other religious institution then i don't think you should be forced to read a certain book about a certain religion 

52.82 54.78 A: right 

55.41 65.53 A: i mean [mn] yeah i know i know like certain certain books are banned from uh from schools you know that like have a lot of ah i guess 

66.10 68.70 A: curse words in them or like ah 

67.50 68.27 B: yeah 

70.37 82.41 A: i don't even know [laughter] actually what books are banned but [noise] i do remember in high school there being some books being banned and stuff and um it was just you know basically it went before some board or something 

82.38 87.66 A: you know and for some reason they just decided rather i guess 

87.81 88.59 A: oh 

89.07 90.06 A: um 

90.89 95.39 A: i don't know i don't know exactly how they decide but they just decide you know to 

95.61 99.74 A: ban that book from [noise] from the reading list of a school 

99.77 106.95 A: and i mean you know there are a few quite a few books that may be considered 

107.67 111.93 A: by like you know conservative school board members to be 

112.08 116.24 A: inappropriate but you know that's like a conservative 

117.33 120.73 A: committee you know who may decide something like that so 

118.40 119.17 B: yeah 

121.47 122.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

122.23 124.95 B: i guess it also depends on their community standards 

125.15 125.98 A: (( ahah )) 

125.25 131.16 B: i mean if you live somewhere in kentucky where it's very religious and conservative then 

131.83 132.74 B: you know 

133.53 138.36 B: the majority should be allowed to decide what books should be banned 

139.06 142.50 B: i mean a minority can't rule over the majority it 

139.41 140.28 A: yeah 

143.77 145.48 A: no that's true but i mean 

146.09 149.53 A: yeah i guess i guess especially with the reading [noise] assignment 

149.84 150.99 A: (( you ah )) 

152.57 157.74 A: [noise] you don't really have a choice as to what you're going to read whereas if you know if you just give 

158.03 167.78 A: the students free rein to read what they like [noise] you know then then i would [noise] argue more against you know [noise] censorship and having a 

168.22 171.90 A: restricted list [noise] of what they could read [noise] so 

174.64 179.67 A: [noise] but uh i grew up in ah [cough] you know like the east coast 

179.81 193.18 A: fairly liberal environment you know and even even so we still had certain books that were not you know on the reading list or or i guess the other the other thing is that you know they're also deemed to be 

193.28 194.80 A: not valuable 

194.97 200.27 A: you know educationally and whatnot again that's very subjective 

200.73 205.54 B: also depends if it's higher education for example if you go to university 

206.82 209.73 B: and there's a purpose in reading that book 

207.02 207.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

211.01 212.54 B: for a certain class 

212.28 214.30 A: mhm 

213.29 215.83 B: for example like race relations or something 

215.85 218.88 B: i know there's a book called that n. word 

219.52 222.47 B: and people it's very controversial 

223.43 225.43 A: mm i haven't heard of that book 

226.18 230.53 B: oh it's not called the n. word but i'm just saying it's i know it's the n. word 

228.56 230.20 A: (( oh oh oh [mn] )) 

230.25 235.83 A: yeah yeah okay yeah i guess i have heard of that yeah 

236.50 237.59 A: um 

239.84 244.26 A: yeah but it's really just the title that's controversial i think so 

242.41 243.65 B: yeah 

247.16 248.28 A: um 

251.43 252.44 A: (( i don't know )) 

255.20 257.67 B: well ten minutes seems a lot 

257.10 262.15 A: [laughter] it does um hm i'm 

263.87 271.06 A: trying to think of like books that i've read recently you know that could be considered controversial um 

271.24 273.31 B: i guess harry potter 

273.96 276.45 B: in elementary schools some districts are 

275.31 276.33 A: mhm 

276.54 278.13 B: banning it 

278.54 280.80 A: some some schools are banning it 

280.24 281.53 B: yeah 

281.96 283.98 A: because it's um 

283.97 285.93 B: like magic and sorcery 

285.18 290.88 A: yeah magic and uh like a pagan kind of stuff or whatever 

289.28 290.19 B: yeah 

290.52 291.54 B: yeah 

292.40 294.40 A: yeah even um 

295.46 299.50 A: i guess ah what was that game it was 

299.79 301.48 A: popular a while back 

301.55 302.74 B: the ouija board 

301.80 302.86 A: uh 

303.09 306.46 A: no not ouija it was with cards and ah 

306.93 308.67 A: dungeons and dragons 

308.24 309.61 B: yeah 

309.28 314.54 A: like i think some schools banned that because you know they felt like there were some 

314.72 319.68 A: violent outbreaks or whatever at at certain schools related to that 

320.50 323.07 A: um [noise] so i mean 

324.11 324.99 A: yeah 

327.14 330.82 A: [noise] like i you know it's easy to say you're ah you can 

330.99 342.45 A: just have an open society and stuff like that but then when you have books that you know that instruct people how to make bombs or [noise] you know things like that you have to draw a line somewhere too 

337.88 338.60 B: (( yeah )) 

343.73 344.97 A: (( um [noise] )) 

345.14 346.52 A: which is you know 

346.67 353.96 A: more of a general censorship kind of thing than just in schools [noise] and what students should be allowed to read so 

354.26 362.97 B: i mean in an ideal world there should be free speech whatsoever but but considering we're not perfect human beings there should be restrictions 

358.02 359.25 A: r- yeah 

367.28 371.48 A: yeah i i'm just curious as to how uh 

371.93 373.86 A: how it's decided 

374.39 383.54 A: you know in communities what books are able to be read by students and which ones aren't or which you know are on the reading lists of assigned books if you 

383.63 389.14 A: if you have a summer off you know what what books make it on the summer reading list 

385.18 385.94 B: yeah 

390.52 395.74 A: um you know if it is in fact a community kind of decision you know like in 

396.08 400.39 A: kentucky or wherever you're talking about you know 

400.83 407.61 A: if the members of whatever committee and i guess it's a committee you know that decides 

407.67 413.53 A: this kind of decision maybe it's just you know the superintendent of schools i really don't know 

413.87 415.40 A: (( um you know )) 

415.73 418.58 A: how are the people who make that decision 

418.64 421.80 A: elected or you know appointed or whatever 

422.37 424.51 A: and it probably varies from place to place 

425.35 427.97 B: i also think there should be options available 

428.15 435.27 B: i mean if you are objecting to a certain book then you should be able to read another book of equal literary merit 

435.78 437.82 A: mhm 

437.43 442.37 B: but i don't know how practical that is considering public education and its 

442.40 443.79 B: current status 

443.64 450.01 A: yeah i mean yeah of course and just the availability of books probably 

449.62 451.06 B: yeah 

450.55 451.58 A: (( so )) 

451.67 452.43 A: (( mm )) 

453.74 455.16 A: yeah if you 

455.69 460.82 A: if you make uh every book or s- several books available you're going to have to buy you 

460.96 463.61 A: know a different copy many copies of 

463.67 464.92 A: different books 

465.37 466.27 A: (( so )) 

466.65 467.26 B: (( mhm )) 

469.42 470.20 A: (( mm )) 

471.40 472.47 B: i mean i get 

472.52 476.33 B: into arguments like this all the time like free speech flag burning 

476.28 477.11 A: (( ahah )) 

476.60 478.40 B: like the nazi parade 

478.61 479.49 A: (( ahah )) 

478.64 480.34 B: (( stuff like that )) 

480.25 482.13 A: you get what email 

481.84 483.68 B: no i get like arguments 

483.29 484.64 A: oh arguments 

483.75 485.73 B: with like random people 

485.65 486.41 A: (( oh )) 

486.51 487.56 A: really 

487.27 488.60 B: yeah 

488.14 489.35 A: (( oh okay )) 

491.38 492.61 A: um 

493.02 496.64 A: i don't really uh get into arguments about it with people 

496.84 498.34 A: but 

498.27 512.48 A: i guess i'm not uh that that vocal about things either i mean you know i don't i don't think like the the k._k._k. should have you know like free speech rights or anything um and i know go 

508.93 509.78 B: yeah 

511.26 512.28 B: i mean their 

513.21 514.49 A: (( ahead i'm sorry )) 

514.08 518.68 B: oh their purpose of existence is like to incite violence and hatred i mean 

518.49 519.65 A: right 

519.04 521.30 B: why should we protect their free speech 

521.17 523.24 A: mhm 

524.83 526.05 A: (( yeah and )) 

524.91 527.03 B: and flag burning i mean 

528.00 529.31 B: it's not 

529.55 532.58 B: to that extremity but i mean 

532.62 536.52 B: it stands for a country and like it or not you live in this country so 

536.80 537.78 B: i mean 

537.80 539.03 B: why burn it 

539.47 540.38 A: right 

545.37 548.00 A: yeah i don't know i think that that's 

549.99 554.51 A: i think it's uh you know disrespectful and everything but i 

554.81 560.19 A: do see [noise] you know it in the purpose of like protesting i guess 

560.10 571.09 B: yeah it's one thing to protest and say the government is doing something wrong but it's another to like outlandishly burn a flag i mean it represents a country it's like our history 

570.95 573.61 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

574.86 575.64 A: (( mm )) 

576.59 580.42 A: so what do people usually argue on the side of 

580.45 582.54 B: that they should be given free speech 

582.29 583.96 A: yeah 

588.83 593.61 A: huh [mn] i guess there isn't much of a debate here uh i'm 

591.37 592.12 B: yeah
