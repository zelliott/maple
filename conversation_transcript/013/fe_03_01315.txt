14.08 20.39 A: i think it infringes on people's rights but i'm not a smoker so i'm happy about it 

29.62 30.28 B: you go 

29.64 30.59 A: no it shouldn't 

30.90 32.69 B: i think that is wrong i mean 

32.96 36.33 B: me and my husband like to go out and eat and we can't go out to eat 

36.43 38.52 B: at some certain restaurants because 

39.08 40.10 B: they won't let us in 

40.26 41.54 A: wow yeah 

41.70 43.27 B: and i don't think that is right 

43.65 43.97 A: i 

50.95 57.47 B: it's it's a disease it should be handled like a disease it's i mean you don't put people who have cancer in the corner 

57.70 58.91 A: right right 

58.54 59.06 B: you know 

59.74 64.11 B: i think it is for them to face and i think you know a support group is great but it's 

64.29 66.90 B: when they feel the time is they should 

67.54 68.08 B: join it 

68.42 70.82 A: i think what they are i think what 

71.15 74.06 A: they are edging towards is making smoking illegal 

73.42 78.26 B: i i feel that way too at times 

78.40 88.14 B: i really do i i think it's i think it's becoming more and more um looking that way it seems like it is going to be treated as a drug at some point 

87.77 88.30 A: right 

88.91 91.07 A: i think there are some people that um 

89.01 89.72 B: (( )) 

100.54 100.88 A: smoke 

100.96 104.42 A: his entire life and now he is like up there in age 

104.76 106.90 A: and he is hacking and stuff now 

107.17 107.89 B: mhm 

107.88 111.02 A: from the smoking and he almost smokes like a pack a day 

108.41 112.15 B: mhm 

111.72 113.40 A: so i don't know i guess 

113.63 115.15 A: from that perspective 

115.57 118.80 A: i kind of also think it is a good thing because 

119.30 119.72 A: if 

120.05 122.01 A: if a lot of places don't allow them to 

122.85 123.83 A: they smoke less 

132.43 132.89 B: i 

147.77 149.73 B: i mean it is great that somebody wants to help them but 

150.36 151.40 A: right -cause i think 

151.52 154.40 A: i think that is why the legislation is passing because 

155.19 161.22 A: these companies have the argument that they are actually helping the people that they are restricting 

161.06 161.69 B: yeah 

161.82 168.52 B: but but at the same time you look at the lawsuits that are still being filed and you know what are they going to do all of a sudden 

184.11 191.00 B: who knows what drug overdose or whatever from taking a certain drug i mean that's i mean that is what it is leaning towards 

187.64 188.43 A: argument 

191.01 191.28 A: mhm 

192.39 195.30 B: that i just don't feel that is right for them for those people 

195.67 198.46 A: i don't know i i guess i'm i'm kind of um 

199.74 205.81 A: i'm a little in the middle about it i i i don't i don't think it is right to take away people's rights but 

206.84 210.80 A: at the same time if it is going to help them in a long-run kind of way 

211.25 211.78 B: mhm 

212.20 215.31 A: i don't see it as as uh as the worst thing 

220.86 221.84 B: you'd just be able to 

221.93 223.92 B: control your rights and keep your rights 

224.71 230.53 A: but but then i think that one of the reasons too why they are banning a lot of public smoking is because 

230.23 231.02 B: mh- 

237.30 240.94 A: to subject other people to smoke like for instance i have asthma 

239.72 240.16 B: (( )) 

240.79 241.60 B: right 

241.17 243.55 A: so whenever someone lights up around me 

243.74 245.46 A: i know have a health problem 

246.08 247.97 B: exactly 

247.18 251.18 A: so i mean i think they are also doing it from that perspective which is 

251.47 253.06 A: i have to be for 

253.17 254.52 A: one hundred percent 

256.25 256.85 A: yeah 

256.44 256.88 B: yeah 

257.20 264.29 B: i i can see both both sides of the story but you know being a non-smoker myself and living with a smoker i can kind of see where 

264.67 267.42 B: you know you would want the person to stop smoking and and 

267.53 278.61 B: don't get me wrong i do but on the same hand i don't think that if it is not immediate or he shouldn't be kicked out of a restaurant or that kind of thing either 
278.37 279.65 A: what did you say your name was 

279.60 280.51 B: my name is cheryl 

280.62 283.54 A: okay so so what do you say 

283.70 289.18 A: when when smokers do have the right to light up in in in a restaurant 

289.31 294.26 A: and there are like people like me who have asthma whose health is affected by the second-hand 

293.57 295.53 B: if someone said something to us 

295.67 300.02 B: my husband without a doubt would immediately put out his cigarette 

298.92 301.17 A: and not all people are as kind 

307.70 312.56 B: to not put out his cigarette or what have you because he wouldn't he is not that 

313.11 313.53 B: you know 

314.33 319.72 B: yeah i i guess you are right in that point and in that perspective not all those people are are as 

319.36 324.91 A: (( )) and trust me trust me you know i've been in situations where 

325.24 327.00 A: someone has lit up and 

327.70 330.53 A: and i'd want to ask but i dare not 

330.17 336.02 B: -cause you can -cause you can just tell by the look on their face that they are not going to 

331.13 332.47 A: (( )) situation 

335.79 339.22 A: look on their face that it is going to be an argument if anything so 

339.99 349.50 A: i don't know i i guess it protects people's rights like myself too so i i hate to have it infringe on some people's rights 

349.72 350.40 B: right 

350.45 358.82 A: but then i have i'd hate to be subjected to second-hand smoke too so i thought what they did when they started separating public areas 

358.96 359.55 A: um 

359.11 361.17 B: see i thought that was a good idea 

360.73 363.16 A: and non-smoking that that was a great idea 

363.51 366.65 B: mhm and i think that is the way it should stay 

364.41 365.51 A: to know you know you can 

365.87 367.30 A: separate every area 

367.68 368.27 A: there are 

367.88 368.41 B: right 

368.41 369.80 A: common areas but 

370.36 372.15 B: and i think that is the way it should stay 

372.20 378.92 A: i i i thought that that would be good that that would be good by separating the areas i guess they are 

379.69 380.74 B: they are not willing to 

379.69 381.92 A: you just have some people who are extremist 

389.84 397.38 B: and the government is making this an illegal an illegal habit such as you know drugs or whatever when you know they should be treating it 

397.49 399.07 B: like a disease 

399.06 399.66 A: right 

399.80 401.25 B: you know and and and 

407.32 407.71 B: you know 

419.54 421.84 A: i i'm going to be devil's advocate for a minute 

419.72 420.32 B: mean you may 

422.48 424.13 A: when you've got cancer 

424.43 426.06 A: you don't have a choice about that 

426.74 427.37 B: right 

426.79 429.09 A: but you do have a choice to smoke or not to smoke 

430.66 440.83 B: well yeah you're you're right but at the same time you know they you do have that choice but they shouldn't make you know they shouldn't make you 

440.95 443.85 B: feel terrible about it about making that choice 

442.65 446.73 A: they shouldn't and i know that that probably ma- makes smokers feel really bad 

447.74 451.14 A: and i i try to say encourage my dad 

451.53 456.40 A: you know when are you going to stop do you want to stop 

460.59 461.42 A: right 

465.25 471.42 B: and you know and it is you know and he is to the point where he is finally going okay you know i've 

471.62 477.58 B: you know he is making a a a (( )) effort to quit by a certain date and you know 

476.79 480.28 A: don't you think that laws like this encourage them to 

480.49 481.05 A: have a 

481.35 484.04 A: little stronger reason to quit though 

489.71 501.63 B: and then they can look at the outside and then look in at themselves but i think that they need to have that self-motivation before they can before they can go that far 

502.86 504.90 B: they have to be self-motivated to quit 

505.12 508.20 B: they have to want to quit 

507.68 508.27 A: they do 

508.45 509.61 B: you know 

508.56 509.70 A: they definitely do 

509.78 511.89 B: if they don't want to then 

512.04 515.98 B: there's there's is just nothing in the world you can do to help somebody like that
