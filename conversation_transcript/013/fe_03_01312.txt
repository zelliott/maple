13.52 14.34 A: so we start now 

16.74 17.08 B: go ahead 

23.63 24.79 A: altogether i think 

25.35 26.80 A: smoking is not going to be banned 

29.69 31.81 A: -gardless of whether anybody try to do it (( )) 

35.13 37.11 A: they have all these truth commercials on 

37.26 38.04 A: t._v. now 

38.87 39.58 A: talking about about 

39.84 40.98 A: how many people died 

42.64 43.80 A: but still people smoke 

46.32 47.38 A: it's not stopping anybody 

49.60 53.42 B: currently where i live it's currently banned to smoke in public um 

54.17 54.66 B: areas 

54.80 56.17 B: restaurants things like that 

56.96 62.02 B: and i believe that's a good thing cause secondhand smoke is becoming more and more of a problem nowadays 

66.94 70.02 B: um currently you can't smoke in restaurants or in 

70.83 71.74 B: you know in shop 

71.97 72.44 B: but you can 

72.54 75.23 B: still smoke in bars and things like that where they don't serve 

78.30 79.76 A: what what state are you in now 

79.89 80.27 B: florida 

80.70 81.05 A: oh 

84.04 85.84 A: well i i haven't been down here long 

87.61 88.08 A: maryland in 

88.23 89.00 A: some places 

89.95 91.02 A: they allow you to smoke in 

99.47 100.90 B: well it's cut down um 

102.03 102.52 B: cut down 

102.66 103.21 B: on 

104.08 106.26 B: hasn't cut down we just started in january 

106.73 112.07 B: hasn't cut down on too many people not going into restaurants things like that that's what they thought at first was going to happen 

113.09 115.53 B: but it's actually made for a more like 

115.82 116.21 B: pleasant 

116.58 117.72 B: atmosphere inside 

118.56 120.40 B: you don't walk into somewhere and start coughing 

120.75 122.48 B: people aren't like smoking while you're trying to 

123.38 123.71 B: you know 

123.96 124.92 B: kind of for some people 

125.92 128.38 B: if they're allergic to smoke things like that it's a problem 

129.62 130.29 B: so overall it 

130.39 131.36 B: like been good here 

141.73 145.20 A: well i i also think it's a good idea to ban smoking in public places 

148.20 150.23 A: but i still don't think that's going to stop anybody fr- 

150.43 151.01 A: trying to smoke 

154.22 156.08 B: well here if they do they're asked to leave 

157.72 159.38 B: so i mean and it's become 

159.53 161.62 B: it's a law so it's enforceable 

163.24 165.44 B: it would they had a hard time passing the law but 

165.57 167.83 B: they were kind of actually shocked that they actually passed it here 

173.75 174.96 B: but overall it's done a lot of the good 

184.08 185.08 B: what state do you live in 

186.07 187.34 A: i live in florida also 

188.40 190.12 A: but i've only been here seven months 

195.30 196.18 A: been out of here 

196.90 197.73 A: out of saint pete 

199.09 200.04 A: for about four months 

200.91 202.39 A: public restaurant for a while 

204.40 205.36 A: so i don't really know 

205.55 207.33 A: that much about people smoking in 

207.62 208.27 A: restaurants 

209.11 209.67 A: public place 

216.01 217.77 B: overall i think it's more of a health thing 

218.29 219.08 B: that people are 

219.21 220.64 B: that's the reason they passed it here 

221.42 222.64 B: is to prevent you know 

222.75 223.16 B: the 

223.63 226.92 B: the harmful results of you know mainly secondhand smoke even 

227.14 227.46 B: for 

228.11 230.00 B: it's also become kind of a workplace thing 

230.11 232.33 B: for people like waitresses and things like that 

233.15 235.24 B: because they're having to be exposed to it and they're worse 

235.36 235.92 B: workplace 

237.69 239.42 B: whereas um they aren't you know 

239.88 241.02 B: they can't exactly leave 

242.46 244.39 B: you know while they're serving somebody if they're smoking 

247.29 248.88 B: so i think that's a big part of it as well 

257.62 259.92 A: i don't even think people should be smoking period 

262.12 263.60 B: well that you can't exactly ban 

264.17 264.81 A: well i know 

265.31 265.91 A: (( )) 

266.72 267.46 A: said that'll never 

269.72 270.68 A: my opinion they should 

271.97 272.25 B: yeah 

276.55 277.77 B: based on the fact that it 

277.86 278.55 B: more of a 

278.66 279.45 B: a habit that 

281.21 282.69 B: you don't need that many 

283.04 283.86 B: like immediate 

284.16 284.69 B: adverse 

285.83 289.56 B: effects on people like you do with alcohol like if somebody drives while under the influence 

290.64 293.39 B: with smoking they're doing it more because it's a habit 

294.23 295.63 B: they need the nicotine kick 

297.64 298.14 B: it's like that 

299.85 302.26 B: they don't really think about like the adverse reaction 

302.85 303.43 B: know like 

304.01 305.03 B: they're smoking blowing 

305.13 306.21 B: smoke in somebody else's 

307.35 308.10 B: um face 

308.93 309.79 B: the long term effect 

309.92 310.65 B: lung cancer

388.94 389.48 B: people 

389.70 392.10 B: people still smoke it's just they go outside to do it 

393.60 394.22 B: and

400.59 400.89 B: here 

401.81 402.91 B: they've actually done 

403.58 404.35 B: (( )) 

403.88 404.86 A: they should do here 

405.06 405.40 B: what

407.33 408.10 B: yeah well they have 

408.30 409.29 B: pretty much tied but 

409.46 410.65 B: (( )) 

416.95 418.51 B: but it's cut down a lot of it though 

419.64 420.44 B: restaurant now 

421.84 423.44 B: there's not ashtrays on all the tables

438.04 438.40 B: yeah 

438.60 439.83 A: i don't know why they did 

441.13 444.32 A: i don't know who would come into mcdonald's and just sit down and smoke anyway 

445.28 445.98 B: quite a few people 

453.14 453.80 A: i don't get it 

454.71 456.30 A: i don't know why they do stuff like that 

460.20 460.69 B: it's a habit

468.99 469.87 B: satisfy the craving 

473.51 474.69 B: but a lot of people thought that 

475.81 476.79 B: doing that here would 

476.90 477.61 B: get rid of um 

478.48 479.25 B: a lot of the business 

480.10 480.36 B: but 

480.88 483.70 B: if people want to go out to eat then you know they're going to have to deal with it
