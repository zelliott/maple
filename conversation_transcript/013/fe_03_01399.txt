49.09 54.80 A: well guess what me either but it's a very uh interesting topic 

55.28 59.88 A: i haven't exercised in a long time [laughter] 

58.77 60.85 B: are you married with children

79.38 81.17 B: to exercise

82.98 90.91 B: no and my husband my husband exercises and i gained wei- i didn't weigh till after i had my third 

86.86 87.86 A: (( isn't that something )) 

90.50 91.98 A: mhm 

91.37 97.79 B: so for the last i'd say i didn't gain weight till she was about two so the last five years or so 

97.42 98.61 A: okay 

97.82 106.71 B: i've put on some weight that i'd never had before and yes i would like to take it off and get on a regular exercise routine how about you 

101.16 102.67 A: right 

104.35 105.57 A: (( sure )) 

105.98 117.81 A: mhm oh yeah definitely because as i'm forty so as i get older you know what i mean i i know exercising is very important and it's something that i need to start doing 

117.58 126.22 B: well it doesn't get any easier i just turned forty four my husband just turned forty yeah the body changes doesn't it 

123.28 124.52 A: oh really 

125.94 129.23 A: yes it does i noticed that at forty 

126.73 127.52 B: and my 

128.87 137.58 B: uh yeah abou- that that it doesn't get any easier and i don't have you ever tried i don't know if you if you are at an appropriate weight or not 

129.82 131.77 A: [laughter] 

137.36 140.82 A: no i'm not i am overweight [laughter] 

139.67 147.31 B: i'm slight- i'm i would say i'm maybe twenty twenty or so pounds overweight at this point i don't hopefully not get any more but 

144.30 145.40 A: mhm 

147.23 157.20 B: uh it's just the um getting the momentum and finding the time to do it i suppose if i weren't on the phone [laughter] i could probably go uh 

152.25 153.52 A: mhm 

157.11 165.71 B: exercise but or take a walk or something during the day but uh and we do have exercise equipment at home do you have exercise equipment at home 

159.52 160.77 A: mhm 

160.78 161.83 A: mhm 

165.41 173.08 A: ah yes my husband he has weights you know at home and i could use those 

170.27 171.20 B: mhm 

173.67 174.82 B: that's true 

174.03 176.84 A: and should use those [laughter] 

176.00 180.00 B: we've got uh i think a nordic track we've got a nordic track and then we got 

178.53 180.74 A: mhm oh do you really 

180.09 190.84 B: yeah and then we got one of those other things that you can do legless and those arms pulls it's like a total fitness thing so we have two things both of which are in our family room 

190.65 193.94 A: oh okay yeah mhm 

191.04 204.61 B: we've a small house so there's no place to put anything so i guess i don't have any excuse we used to belong before we had kids we used to belong to the belly fitness center fitness center and would go on a regular basis to exercise 

200.06 201.56 A: yeah uh-huh 

204.11 205.58 A: right 

204.54 207.28 B: before you had kids did you do the same thing 

206.90 214.71 A: yes definitely and you know i used to run and swim and you know do everything 

214.93 217.27 A: but of course that is no excuse 

216.82 225.88 B: no i i guess it isn't let's see i have let's see when i stop exercising uh i took pregnancy exercise classes 

225.65 226.68 A: mhm 

225.89 229.92 B: so i did exercise while i was pregnant which made the deliveries easier 

229.66 231.11 A: right 

229.97 233.77 B: and after i had the babies i never got back to it 

233.38 238.18 A: to it yeah i see that when i had my third one i lost a lot of weight too 

237.75 250.73 B: uh i lost a lot of weight i lost not only my weight but my pregnancy weight but extra weight besides that but then i don't know what it was at thirty eight boom i i started to put on weight and and 

243.21 244.53 A: mhm 

247.89 249.34 A: yeah 

250.63 254.05 B: maybe it's the bad eating habits too the fast food doesn't help 

253.89 255.17 A: no it doesn't 

255.19 257.26 A: and you know with having kids 

257.54 262.63 A: that makes it easy to go to fast food places [laughter] 

260.14 268.77 B: uh that's that's true and th- the sad part about it is my kids don't always eat right either their grandparents tend to give 'em 

269.28 271.04 B: junkie food sometimes 

270.51 272.04 A: uh okay 

271.07 285.12 B: uh here's candy here is candy here's donuts here's cookies and and i normally don't carry a lot of that stuff in my house except for the girl scout cookies because i got two girl scouts in my house what what about your household do you carry a lot of junk too 

273.08 275.86 A: oh yeah that's true that's true 

277.70 279.02 A: yeah 

281.24 282.92 A: oh do you good for you 

284.61 297.17 A: we do that's that's my biggest problem is that we do have a lot of my husband's always buying donuts but he exercises [laughter] but he's always buying donuts and you know i eat a lot of the junk 

290.46 291.30 B: mhm 

297.21 298.58 A: junk food 

298.40 305.13 B: did he um either of you of you make a new year's resolution to like exercise or lose weight or 

305.19 306.14 A: no 

306.79 309.58 A: not i and not him either 

307.63 308.42 B: (( do )) 

309.07 311.13 B: you bicycle ride or anything 

310.80 316.19 A: no [laughter] see i work at home so it makes it kinda difficult 

315.92 329.85 B: uh i yeah i suppose i i'm trying to think of an excuse why i shouldn't be doing it but i really can't i probably could find some time during the day but there's always something to do around the house or or or some other work 

324.43 325.53 A: mhm 

327.88 329.07 A: right 

329.58 341.09 A: yeah and you know that's the thing i'm i'm trying to figure out why i do make excuses to be honest with you i'm afraid to start exercising thinking that i'm gonna hurt something [laughter] 

340.46 346.21 B: uh that that for me that would probably be part of it my doctor told me the best thing to do was just to start walking 

345.92 347.19 A: mhm 

346.55 357.44 B: and he said that if i would just walk a couple of miles or walk around the block he said the it the increase in calories that would get burned lasts for nine hours 

357.05 358.22 A: oh really 

357.63 359.59 B: after i would walk 

359.00 360.07 A: (( mm )) 

359.62 361.22 B: so um 

360.88 362.44 A: that's good to know 

361.65 367.73 B: yeah maybe i'll do that probably because i never had a weight problem all my life i really didn't pay much attention to it 

365.09 366.14 A: mhm 

367.31 368.64 A: right 

367.83 375.82 B: and then when i was really really really skinny i wasn't happy being real skinny i didn't feel good i don't know about you but i didn't feel good being real thin 

371.69 372.72 A: mhm 

373.16 374.49 A: right 

375.65 377.18 A: yeah 

376.22 379.85 B: but uh no i suppose i suppose that i should 

380.06 387.12 A: you know what maybe that's why we choose not to do it because you know i didn't feel good when i was skinny either 

388.03 394.85 B: and i didn't i wasn't eating ri i mean i just wasn't eating i wasn't hungry i didn't i have more ener- well i don't have a lot of energy but i have 

390.63 392.52 A: mhm mhm 

395.09 397.62 B: i think i get more energy when i exercise 

397.50 398.28 A: (( mm )) 

398.34 399.79 B: when i do exercise 

398.87 400.50 A: definitely 

399.84 403.73 B: yeah i think i'm maybe my mental well being might be better too 

403.36 404.54 A: mhm 

403.78 412.91 B: i know they say exercising in the morning is good and i know parents at school who jog real early in the morning i can't even imagine it are you a morning person 

408.86 410.31 A: mhm 

410.98 412.33 A: right 

412.41 423.09 A: i am a morning person and so that's what i really should get up in the morning and do something you know before everybody gets up that's why i like to get up early early 

423.12 426.03 A: you know because nobody's up and it's quiet 

426.08 428.53 A: you know maybe i should get up and do something 

428.30 435.24 B: when i was in college i used to do that stuff and weightlift um and bodybuild all that stuff 

434.79 435.84 A: oh really 

435.33 438.01 B: yeah i was into body building for a while 

437.88 438.94 A: (( oh cool )) 

438.22 439.85 B: and uh 

438.95 440.38 A: that's good for you 

440.00 441.78 B: uh yeah i think it prob- 

441.98 447.54 B: i never looked so good i had put muscle on because i was very thin the doctors said it was a way for me to put on some weight 

447.29 448.38 A: okay 

447.98 456.47 B: was to weightlift and body build and and uh i put on a little bit but not a whole lot and then it gave me an appetite and i was actually able to eat better 

449.22 451.31 A: mhm mhm 

456.18 457.04 A: okay 

456.47 463.72 B: but and i felt good not eating chocolate and all the junk anymore and then i didn't want it but then all of a sudden and once you start on it [laughter] 

459.73 460.95 A: right 

461.76 463.06 A: (( mhm )) 

464.36 466.05 A: you get that taste again 

465.44 467.13 B: well i'm a chocoholic 

466.93 467.84 A: me too 

467.39 469.90 B: and my husband's side of the family likes to eat 

469.83 470.90 A: okay 

470.45 477.95 B: and i uh probably could care less whether i had a meal or not and they like to eat out at restaurants good restaurants 

477.37 478.87 A: mhm 

478.25 479.70 B: casual restaurants 

479.71 482.93 B: uh they like to eat out all the time do you do you eat out a lot 

481.45 482.34 A: okay 

482.90 487.26 A: yeah we do we do a lot of fast food places 

486.67 488.10 B: oh okay 

487.33 489.92 A: you know instead of home cooked meals you know 

490.45 495.64 B: mm yeah so uh i suppose i should do some diet cooking but uh 

492.53 493.76 A: (( well that's interesting ))

520.35 521.58 A: (( yeah well )) 

522.44 526.74 B: exercising or losing weight i think you have to both eat right and exercise
