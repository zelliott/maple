17.94 19.13 A: why don't you 

18.94 32.56 B: [lipsmack] um well my job i work in theater and um my hours are really kinda screwy i kind of work from about early afternoon until usually about ten or eleven at night 

32.72 40.98 B: and then in the mornings after i you know i get home and i wanna stay up and t._v. and unwind then when i get up in the mornings i don't feel like it so 

40.99 44.84 B: i haven't put it into my schedule yet but i do need to 

45.39 46.96 A: do you um 

48.00 54.19 A: uh work the box office or do you work uh as an actress or 

51.36 52.90 B: i'm actually um

55.62 56.58 A: (( ah interesting )) 

57.97 64.18 B: so i tell everyone what to do and during the rehearsal period i um direct and whatnot but 

65.10 66.45 B: it's a lot of running 

66.49 70.04 B: but it's not really [laughter] exercise [laughter] 

69.96 71.06 A: [laughter] 

72.58 77.10 A: in a way you could consider that there's some exercise involved with your job right 

77.03 78.46 B: yeah that's true 

78.35 83.63 A: i mean you walk around at a hurried pace and you know you're hustling around getting things done 

83.57 84.99 B: that's true 

85.21 86.41 A: yeah 

85.76 88.36 B: but the bad thing is is that i smoke 

88.45 89.40 A: (( uh )) 

89.34 97.64 B: [laughter] so that kinda cancels out any of that so i gotta quit that and i gotta start doing something walking or something 

89.49 90.56 A: that'll do ya 

98.16 101.55 A: mm walking is a good start bicycle's even better 

99.60 100.85 B: [laughter] 

101.50 104.86 B: yeah that's true my husband rides bikes but i don't 

105.14 107.07 B: i used to but then 

107.10 111.44 B: my sister borrowed my bike and got it stolen so that kinda wound that up 

111.16 112.30 A: (( yeah )) 

111.61 113.64 B: [laughter] 

113.82 119.47 B: i guess if you could chase a two year old and count that as exercise and i do that every day so 

119.03 121.20 A: that is definitely exercise 

120.57 122.96 B: [laughter] 

122.99 124.69 B: most definitely 

125.34 127.67 A: yeah two year olds are a handful aren't they 

127.54 128.38 B: (( oh )) 

128.83 130.16 B: (( that's the truth )) 

131.37 132.79 A: [laughter] 

131.88 133.79 B: do you exercise [laughter] i i 

134.20 135.67 B: mean what what sort of 

134.25 136.83 A: yeah actually i do um 

136.61 139.41 B: i mean do you exercise every day twice a week do

153.34 154.47 A: um 

155.56 164.67 A: m- my instructor has this small gym type place it's j- it's basically just um a couple of punching bags and a big mat in front of a large mirror 

165.11 166.04 B: okay 

166.10 172.31 A: but it's a really good workout really s- um strenuous in the cardiovascular and uh 

172.51 174.80 A: muscle conditioning uh 

174.92 177.90 A: mental conditioning huge on mental conditioning because 

177.98 191.62 A: you know w- when you're trying to avoid getting punched in the face and you're trying to punch somebody else in the in the ribs you know you gotta be completely on point with all that yeah exactly exactly so 

185.43 187.70 B: pretty quick yeah 

190.93 196.20 B: i- i'd like to do something like that except for we live in a really small town now we moved here about a year ago 

196.35 202.11 B: and really the closest place for any of that would be about an hour away 

202.33 203.51 A: (( yeah )) 

202.91 208.04 B: we have a really small gym here that's owned by a local person but i mean it's 

208.51 210.69 B: it's kinda crappy so 

210.24 211.46 A: (( yeah )) 

210.82 217.10 B: [laughter] they kind of just give you a key and you go there and you work out and lock up when you're done so it's not 

216.23 217.90 A: oh that's not so bad 

217.30 225.50 B: see i need somebody to show me what to do and what i need to do and how long that i need to do each thing so that's not really 

220.30 221.21 A: [laughter] 

221.96 222.86 A: yeah 

224.64 226.53 A: mhm 

225.51 227.45 B: good for a person like me 

227.76 231.22 A: yeah um do you have mornings available to you 

231.73 237.94 B: i do but i usually waste those mornings i sit around and not do anything i 

238.18 241.32 A: mm well try going out and uh 

241.65 243.88 A: you know just walking around and seeing stuff 

243.90 244.79 B: need to 

243.95 248.08 A: it definitely helps not only your body but definitely your overall mood 

248.44 258.14 B: yeah i think it would help a lot i used to skydive but i haven't done that since i got married 'cause my mother in law threatened to kill me [laughter] if i did it any more so 

248.55 249.47 A: i mean 

257.71 264.11 A: oh you shouldn't be afraid of anybody especially your mother in law if you if you've been able to jump out an airplane before 

260.89 262.94 B: (( [laughter] )) 

263.77 265.22 B: (( that's true )) 

265.00 268.21 A: you know i mean honestly if you can jump out of an airplane 

268.22 270.00 A: you can handle a mother in law 

269.54 274.48 B: [laughter] that's the truth [laughter] 

274.73 287.35 B: especially after i had my child she was said you know you know absolutely not [laughter] she's pretty feisty but she she lives in pennsylvania and we live in georgia so she wouldn't know 

280.73 281.78 A: (( oh )) 

282.47 283.48 A: yes 

287.75 292.26 A: yeah exactly [noise] what doesn't what she doesn't know won't hurt 

288.79 289.85 B: [laughter] 

291.67 294.84 B: that's right [laughter] 

294.31 297.55 A: (( her [noise] )) 

296.48 300.52 B: yeah that was pretty much the only exercise that i was doing for a while 

300.65 301.66 B: and then 

301.81 311.16 B: mm when i was younger i took dance for about eleven years for about six to eight hours a week so but after that i just i stopped [laughter] 

308.28 310.11 A: mhm 

311.53 314.27 A: (( yeah [noise] let's )) 

314.71 316.21 A: (( see um )) 

317.69 321.83 A: daily exercise helps me to maintain my 

322.22 325.13 A: mood and definitely my confidence 

325.15 326.99 A: in myself uh 

327.39 332.91 A: (( you know just being able to yourself and know what you really can do in a situation )) 

333.70 335.97 A: [mn] it's al it's always positive [laughter] 

335.40 336.53 B: right 

336.53 337.73 A: yeah 

336.57 344.91 B: yeah i think it would help me feel a lot better because my husband always teases me about my poor diet and [laughter] lack of exercise so 

345.01 348.01 A: well you should tell him to stop teasing you and start helping you 

346.50 354.19 B: [laughter] yeah exactly while he's sitting on the couch smoking cigarettes he's not really [laughter] getting a lot of exercise either 

354.16 355.58 A: yeah exactly 

355.20 357.62 B: (( so [laughter] )) 

356.89 359.25 A: go tell him what's up [laughter] [noise] 

358.28 367.98 B: yeah exactly but he joined the gym in tallahassee so when he's down there working he gets to work out but it's just not real convenient for me 

366.30 367.16 A: (( fair enough )) 

368.15 372.89 A: oh yeah yeah understandable how far away from tallahassee are you 

369.05 370.62 B: (( [laughter] )) 

372.67 373.99 B: about 

374.18 375.83 B: sixty miles 

376.41 378.71 A: wow that's a pretty good distance 

378.35 380.00 B: yeah [laughter] 

380.06 380.88 A: huh 

380.47 386.50 B: but i mean you know like i said there is that one gym here but i mean it's crappy so 

386.06 388.61 A: you know even that just go in there 

388.74 391.81 A: and just uh work yourself until 

391.86 394.75 A: you feel your heart rate accelerate 

394.08 394.94 B: uh-huh 

394.85 402.75 A: you know you do that a couple of times a week you start going in there a little bit longer and trying out different things it's not so much like 

403.06 414.29 A: having somebody there to to help you out like to show you stuff 'cause you could figure it out all all you're really doing is really lifting stuff up and putting it back down but the key to all that is just go slowly you know 

407.26 408.24 B: (( mhm )) 

414.03 418.48 B: right well how long do you think i need to at first when i start out i mean 

414.85 415.74 A: (( and do- )) 

418.12 421.35 A: try ten or fifteen minutes at the mo- at the least i mean 

421.74 424.01 A: fifteen minutes is a good workout 

423.47 432.81 B: okay well that's probably why i don't like to then because i always go and i think that i need to be there an hour or something [laughter] and then you get 

428.92 430.74 A: oh not even close 

431.57 433.24 A: once you start sweating 

433.78 438.89 A: once you seriously start sweating and breathing hard that's when you know that you've reached 

438.90 442.23 A: um a line and that that's your 

442.25 448.19 A: that's the beginning of your threshold right there basically and that that's when you're starting to really exert yourself you know 

444.23 445.24 B: okay 

447.82 448.71 B: uh-huh 

448.35 454.38 A: so if you can maintain that kind of exertion level that kind of intensity for at least five or ten minutes 

454.20 455.21 B: mhm 

454.47 456.66 A: you're really you're doing good because 

456.68 460.81 A: you only need to work out maybe fifteen twenty minutes a day every day 

460.83 461.81 B: okay 

460.84 468.70 A: you know or even just twice three times a week 'cause even that little bit will just stimulate you to wanna go in there more and more you know 

468.73 477.88 B: that's true well i think i'll start doing that i mean i i've been wanting to i just you know have made excuses about well i'm busy and [laughter] 

477.27 479.90 A: yeah i i've done the exact same thing and then 

478.87 480.96 B: [laughter] 

480.29 486.06 A: i finally just got on it and just i haven't looked back i love it you know now 

484.74 486.00 B: well how long have 

486.43 488.93 B: how long have you been doing it regularly i mean 

488.85 490.66 A: um since december 

488.98 491.81 B: uh years or recently or 

491.68 497.49 A: well i've always been really active i played soccer for about fifteen or sixteen years of my life 

493.33 494.12 B: mhm 

497.68 501.40 A: [lipsmack] and then i uh snowboarded about 

501.77 504.91 A: it's probably my thirteenth season now and 

505.58 509.30 A: um [sigh] always been into hiking and running around 

509.45 511.46 A: (( i just went to play golf today )) 

512.05 512.79 B: wow 

514.22 518.51 B: yeah we have a nice golf course maybe i could do something like that [laughter] 

514.65 515.86 A: yeah i keep pretty 

517.92 522.84 A: yeah even just walking around the the grass for a few hours you know is good stuff 

523.28 524.78 A: plus you'd be outside 

524.47 528.35 B: yeah that's true and it's always real warm here what state do you live in 

528.30 529.37 A: utah 

528.91 530.35 B: utah okay 

530.94 534.00 B: it's not as warm as it [laughter] is here 

533.20 535.15 A: it was actually really nice today 

535.40 536.34 B: (( hm wow )) 

536.82 537.94 A: spring time 

539.23 543.40 B: snowboarding i [laughter] i don't think i'd ever be very good at that 

541.32 543.07 A: yeah 

543.36 544.39 A: [laughter] 

543.71 550.88 B: i went snow skiing one time in pennsylvania when we went to visit my husband's family and it was not successful at all [laughter] 

551.45 552.95 A: yeah that's a hard one 

552.50 555.28 B: i thought i would be good at it but then you know i'd 

555.64 557.31 B: practise on the little 

558.10 562.59 B: kids' thing where you hold on to the little bar and it pulls you 

561.64 562.61 A: uh-huh 

562.61 570.59 B: and then my husband said you're ready you're ready and this is a baby hill come on and you're ready for it and [laughter] yeah it was not 

567.40 568.85 A: baby hill huh 

570.46 578.54 B: i kept making myself sit down just so that i could stop 'cause i thought i was going too fast and i was afraid i'd roll down the hill or something but 

578.83 582.03 B: the snowboarding looks like it would be a lot more fun 

582.09 583.57 A: oh it definitely is 

583.36 585.03 B: is it easier or 

585.29 588.61 A: um i'd have to say that it's a lot easier to learn 

588.33 589.32 B: okay 

589.94 591.43 A: yeah 

591.29 593.72 B: because i can water ski and i can 

593.95 595.01 B: do that little 

595.57 597.69 B: kneeboard or whatever but 

598.67 599.89 B: (( hm i thought i'd be able ))
