0.74 1.94 A: hello 

1.64 4.25 B: hi this is jackie how are you doing 

3.70 6.43 A: [laughter] good this is julie i'm fine 

6.89 16.57 B: uh well julie in response to the question i think it does help um i am not a smoker and i i think it's something that just brings the awareness out 

16.70 18.54 B: of what smoking can do for you 

18.42 26.81 A: yeah i think it helps minimally i am all for the banning of smoking in public places i'm not a smoker either so i am all for that 

25.02 25.91 B: well 

27.01 31.95 A: it [laughter] it we we don't like coming home from restaurants smelling like a big cigarette 

32.09 44.41 B: well i can't say that i'm all for it because if we totally take it away from them then the smokers will say they have no rights but i think that there should definitely be a smoking section that is 

32.15 33.63 A: and breathing [noise] 

44.27 50.46 B: away from the non smoking section so that you don't have to go through a smoking section to get to a non smoking 

50.83 54.37 A: well that's a good point but as for their rights [laughter] 

53.89 55.86 B: well right they have rights that 

54.43 58.58 A: i guess i don't really we have rights too that we don't have to to breathe that in 

56.76 60.70 B: right we have rights too and so many times our rights are not 

60.73 62.58 B: heard or paid attention to 

62.25 63.44 A: exactly 

64.71 67.65 B: so okay did we answer that question [laughter]

107.72 110.77 A: oh all right i wonder how we're doing [laughter] 

110.13 112.06 B: uh [laughter] i don't know 

112.23 115.65 B: obviously not too good since we can't make mr computer go on [laughter] 

113.70 115.00 A: [laughter] 

116.20 118.37 A: maybe we should be quiet for a little bit hm 

117.88 118.93 B: (( maybe okay )) 

125.62 126.40 B: [noise] hm 

126.36 127.42 A: (( [lipsmack] okay )) 

127.75 131.97 A: [noise] um let's see do you have your little sheet that it tells 

131.48 133.39 B: no i'm in the car 

133.28 136.89 A: when you may receive a call p._i._n. followed by pound 

138.70 140.38 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

142.18 143.49 A: (( dit dit dit dit dah answer the )) 

144.93 148.25 A: doesn't say anything i guess we're supposed to go on for ten minutes [sigh] 

148.33 149.26 A: (( hm )) 

149.38 151.07 B: okay 

150.48 153.95 A: um i think let's see 

155.86 159.13 A: um hm i think i said what i think 

159.47 163.99 A: we ask you to speak on a proposed topic for at least eight minutes oh okay so we're supposed to go on 

159.87 160.56 B: (( uh-huh )) 

164.02 170.00 A: um all right smoking do you think the advertisements is that what it said do you think the advertising and stuff have made a difference 

171.70 174.51 B: i think it makes an awareness in the younger generation 

173.60 176.47 A: is is that what it said okay i didn't i didn't really 

175.71 181.87 B: well well it was talking about the awareness is it is it m- minimizing 

182.03 188.00 B: the smokers is the way i interpreted the question and i think it's making an awareness in the younger generation 

183.51 184.45 A: yeah 

184.68 185.56 A: yeah 

188.07 189.08 B: um 

189.02 191.71 A: you know i think it is too but aren't the um 

192.28 198.63 A: the statistics show that there's even more [noise] younger aged kids smoking today than than like in our time 

197.68 201.06 B: than before like like like in our time um 

198.90 199.84 A: yeah 

200.23 205.53 A: so even with the knowledge they're still continuing to to smoke i don't i don't get it 

205.62 207.20 A: maybe it's a coolness thing 

207.01 211.74 B: well i think it's a you know it's a coolness thing and then some of it's a lack of parental guidance too 

211.59 218.73 A: [lipsmack] yeah but then there again the cigarettes are what up to three bucks a pack or something where are they getting the money for this stuff i don't understand but um 

218.10 227.44 B: well uh but then so many that that's where the parental guidance comes in though because parents give 'em money and drop 'em off at malls or drop 'em off here or there or whatever 

221.54 222.87 A: yeah 

227.58 229.39 B: just so the parents don't have to deal with 'em 

229.40 231.02 A: yeah yeah 

230.33 237.76 B: so it's you know it's and the kids are gonna find a way somebody thinks it's cool and so yeah they'll pick it up for you and 

233.79 234.67 A: oh yeah 

236.76 244.63 A: yeah so you think the restaurants and things should have a separate entrance for sm- for non smokers is that kinda what you were saying 

244.16 245.14 B: yeah 

245.23 248.39 B: almost like a a segregated issue 

248.37 260.95 A: yeah see i think that would i think that would almost cost them more money to to you know rearrange and configure their restaurants than it would be just to say 'cause like in california and everywhere that they've already banned it i think their business is picking up 

249.69 250.98 B: (( well you know i hate to )) 

261.49 268.64 A: i think that that's what has come back on the news anyway is that their business is actually increasing that since they've increased or since they've cut out smoking 

269.64 272.71 A: so that's probably the cheaper option for them if you 

269.68 270.71 B: (( now yeah )) 

271.92 278.60 B: i think for the for the businesses it's a cheaper option um and and i think if 

278.62 279.42 B: i mean 

280.04 283.42 B: i'm i'm totally against it i can't stand the smell of it 

282.72 284.46 A: (( i know [laughter] i am too )) 

284.40 286.42 B: [laughter] but at the same 

285.09 294.47 A: i feel bad for my kids i have young kids and when we go out to eat they're just i even have a little you know one year old and he just breathes in all that stuff and it's just 

293.95 300.06 B: well my mother smokes and i have a two year old and you know he'll tell her grandma you stink 

299.66 309.44 A: yeah you know i've got a i've got a friend that he she's got a little baby a little eight month old baby and he will not even go to his grandma 'cause she smells like cigarettes he he yeah i 

301.05 302.02 B: you know 

308.17 308.99 B: (( yeah )) 

309.27 313.33 B: well you know and they walk in the house and you smell them before you ever see them 

312.76 313.98 A: know i know 

314.11 315.76 A: i just i'm 

314.43 318.75 B: and this you know how can you walk around smelling like a wet ashtray 

318.56 323.85 A: i know i'm totally for the banning i i i don't i i mean i understand the rights and everything 

319.57 320.50 B: and then 

323.47 324.98 B: right 

324.42 336.07 A: but [sigh] come on i i don't know it we have rights too if they if they wanna kill themselves i think they should go somewhere else and kill themselves and i think they can go a whole hour without a cigarette at a restaurant 

336.18 338.55 A: i mean if they can't they're in big trouble 

339.75 341.02 A: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

341.20 346.83 A: as i cough [laughter] as i have the smoker's cough there oh jeeze 

342.49 344.32 B: [laughter] 

346.09 350.76 B: well and they say second hand smoke is just as dangerous if not worse than primary smoke 

349.87 359.46 A: right 'cause it's not filtered yeah that's i don't know and airports at least are making 'em go outside i mean i think that's you know why can't they say go outside 

353.14 353.92 B: (( [noise] )) 

357.91 366.30 B: but if they're gonna make 'em go outside make 'em go far enough away from the building so that those of us who do not smoke don't have to walk straight through it 

365.59 368.34 A: exactly yeah that's a good point too 

366.85 378.88 B: i mean what's the point of making them go outside if they're gonna be clamored around the door so that it either rushes to the doors when the doors open or you walk through a pillow of blue smoke trying to get in 

376.70 379.96 A: [laughter] yeah yeah that's true 

379.18 382.68 B: it's like going to a nightclub you you smell the same way 

381.03 381.80 A: that's 

382.27 393.05 A: yeah now nightclubs i you know that i guess i don't know that's gonna be really hard to to try and ban that but restaurants i don't know i just think it's the restaurants are for families to go out and have dinner 

393.05 397.97 A: we don't need to breathe in that crap i choose not to go to nightclubs because of that reason i don't want to breathe the smoke 

396.66 399.09 B: well i do too i don't like the the smoke 

398.25 405.49 A: but restaurants come on they're for everybody and i i i you know if they wanna go drink and smoke go tell 'em to go to a bar and have bar food 

405.38 416.10 A: that's what i feel [laughter] yeah [laughter] and i've just recently gotten this bad since i've had kids i mean i i didn't really mind it before but since i've had kids i just [sigh] 

407.11 408.19 B: go for it 

409.06 409.94 B: (( yay )) 

416.33 421.98 A: i i just feel sorry for them i mean i've already had my damage done to my lungs breathing in everybody's smoke but 

422.20 424.14 A: [lipsmack] i don't want them to [sigh] 

424.58 425.48 A: so 

425.91 427.74 B: and i think the 

427.97 439.46 B: the tobacco makers should be the ones that have to pay and i'm sure they are but i you know i've never done the research for all of the commercials on smoking 

439.52 440.28 A: yeah 

439.59 444.54 B: and b- you know against the smoking and stuff that should not come out of my money 

444.07 446.42 A: exactly exactly 

445.49 452.36 B: i mean that's a choice i don't make so therefore those people that are w- that are willing to pay the three or four dollars however much it is 

451.57 453.37 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

452.79 456.95 B: they can pay to educate themselves on their retarded behavior 

456.59 460.60 A: exactly i'm for that i hear ya i agree with ya there [sigh] 

460.57 461.51 B: so 

461.26 465.49 A: and as far as them taxing cigarettes you know you go for it if if you 

464.81 466.14 B: tax it all 

465.64 473.25 A: tax it all [laughter] that's fine they can afford a four dollar pack of cigarettes they can afford to pay more taxes and you know 

472.69 482.71 B: if e- exactly you know if if they think they can't live without it if they have to pay that four dollars well then let 'em charge 'em 

477.65 478.74 A: mhm 

482.82 491.08 A: that's funny you say they can't live without it they can't live with it it's just you know it's like how can you i know [laughter] i know it is [cough] 

483.18 484.69 B: it's unhealthy 

487.56 488.87 B: it's an oxymoron 

492.21 493.90 A: okay let's see 

494.36 495.23 A: (( so )) 

495.68 496.88 A: um 

498.84 500.01 A: (( what hm )) 

499.88 503.78 B: so now where you have they totally banned it in all your restaurants 

503.66 507.88 A: oh no no i think just a couple of small towns here have 

507.52 511.20 B: now i know um one of our tex mex restaurants 

511.56 513.93 B: has banned it on sundays 

514.44 516.74 A: (( [noise] oh really you know what that's true one of our )) 

515.78 518.37 B: during certain during lunch hours 

517.80 522.85 A: yeah one of our pizza places here has banned it on the weekends from like five to midnight yeah 

520.88 521.84 B: right 

521.92 529.47 B: and i guess that's more of a family time you know but like from lunch to like seven it's banned 

525.00 526.03 A: yeah 

529.08 534.74 A: yeah so they're definitely probably hearing complaints and the restaurants are trying to do something about it i guess and they're 

534.14 535.18 B: right 

534.79 536.39 A: yeah [sigh] 

536.62 538.35 B: i think that um [lipsmack] 

539.32 540.84 A: (( but it just )) 

539.92 544.69 B: another thing that unnerves me other than the fact that you have to walk through 

544.75 547.37 B: the smoking section to get to the non smoking 

547.60 550.93 B: is the fact that they're you know not separated enough 

550.43 556.53 A: oh i know it cracks me up some of these restaurants have smoking like you know one table next to you is smoking 

555.44 559.84 B: the very next booth is non it's non smoking so it's like what's the point 

556.69 558.29 A: yeah yeah that's 

559.19 562.40 A: yeah exactly that is not even 

560.97 564.08 B: or you walk in and the smell hits you 

563.82 564.90 A: yeah 

564.30 566.96 B: even over the aromas of the of the restaurant 

566.33 570.84 A: yeah and then they try to put the ceiling fans in to try and you know blow it out it's like 

569.54 572.17 B: yeah l- let's lift it up right 

570.93 574.17 A: yeah let's [laughter] yeah just blow it all over the place 

575.67 576.47 A: [cough] 

575.82 576.88 B: so 

576.53 577.58 A: i don't know 

578.40 579.79 A: [lipsmack] has it been eight minutes 

579.16 580.98 B: that was an interesting topic 

581.01 585.04 A: very interesting and it's something i feel very strongly about too so i 

585.40 586.59 A: i don't know i guess 

588.00 590.64 A: i don't know if that's what they wanted to hear but 

591.61 594.82 A: [laughter] [noise] sorry about that toy box 

594.20 594.90 B: oh 

597.66 598.35 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

599.16 599.95 A: i just punched
