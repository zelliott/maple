38.21 39.16 A: (( cool ahah )) 

38.79 39.66 B: um 

39.83 43.68 B: my feelings on on the subject is i think that um 

44.25 49.62 B: and i i have attended public schools before most of my school career was public school 

49.68 51.78 B: um i feel that 

51.83 57.95 B: the public schools do have the right to censor um what books students read 

58.22 62.52 B: um for the simple fact that whatever a person 

63.02 64.60 B: it has been proven 

64.72 67.01 B: um by studies and even um 

67.10 75.45 B: i think you can relate to this too even from your own personal experiences that what you read can influence the way you think and the things that you do 

75.96 81.35 A: yeah i totally agree with that i have um a daughter that's at high school now 

81.09 81.91 B: mhm 

81.62 82.75 A: and 

83.02 94.38 A: and um there's a lot of the books that she's reading that i ended up reading uh back when i was in high school and that i've one that's out of high school 

94.49 100.06 A: but yeah you're right even so- a lot of the magazines it's nothing but trash 

99.67 100.61 B: mhm 

100.29 110.68 A: you know but unfortunately you know those are being sold at the you know at the check out stands so those can't really be censored unless a parent gets hold of them and flips through them and checks them first 

110.37 111.59 B: (( [cough] right )) 

110.99 112.92 A: but as far as the 

113.05 115.56 A: you know the books that are going through the school 

115.58 119.61 A: in a certain [mn] certain reading material um 

119.68 122.48 A: depends i guess it really depends on the 

123.28 128.19 A: subject like they had a my daughter um she just finished 

128.40 130.80 A: doing a a mythology class 

130.61 131.90 B: mhm 

131.26 136.26 A: and so she was reading a mythology book and it was i mean you you had to do 

136.34 142.72 A: you know three fours of the book and then one part um one fourth dictionary just to know what they were talking about 

142.18 143.10 B: right 

142.79 143.76 A: you know 

143.80 145.45 A: (( but um [mn] )) 

146.43 151.97 A: y- you know the it- it's basically in in the english classes where um 

152.26 154.16 A: a lot of the teachers 

154.75 160.22 A: you know just like throwing books in there um i remember reading romeo and juliet 

157.27 158.24 B: mhm 

160.06 160.97 B: mhm 

160.60 161.62 A: um 

162.05 165.93 A: what was the other one um my daughter's now reading to kill a mocking bird 

165.58 166.57 B: mhm 

166.36 167.44 A: (( you know )) 

168.45 173.89 A: they're really great they're showing you different ways of establishing the english language 

173.61 174.55 B: right 

174.25 175.29 A: (( you know )) 

175.36 176.62 A: (( but um )) 

176.73 178.14 A: other than that 

178.76 180.20 A: you know ah i- ah 

181.11 190.09 A: it's it's really hard i i know it is hard because you ha- for the teachers especially for the schools you know 

190.84 193.30 A: to pick a book that would grab 

194.19 196.13 A: everybody you know people's attention 

195.83 196.85 B: mhm 

196.20 198.06 A: and i know like [mn] 

198.48 204.57 A: even romeo and juliet you read the book you don't really understand the book you watch the movie at school 

204.33 205.76 B: right [laughter] 

204.73 213.18 A: you know um [mn] it it now happened nowadays i mean you get a tea- you get a child to read a book you're lucky it hasn't been shown on video 

212.89 213.90 B: mhm 

213.64 216.16 A: you know but um 

215.57 220.35 B: that was a part of my experience too [cough] studying language arts and english 

221.46 224.10 B: when we read shakespeare in high school 

224.30 228.47 B: i understood a little bit of what um was being said 

228.11 229.51 A: mhm 

228.75 234.31 B: but it ah it didn't really come together until like you said they showed the movie 

233.97 235.25 A: yeah 

234.58 237.24 B: in class and um 

237.39 239.28 B: i think too that 

239.66 240.61 B: um 

240.78 253.21 B: you know kids i mean and you know children in public school they come from all different types of backgrounds and some parents you know they are really interested in what their kids are learning 

247.24 248.30 A: (( mhm )) 

253.36 259.86 B: and will sit down and explain to them what it is that they're reading and that other parents they're just not there for them 

259.96 268.59 B: or even you know the student may not even have parents they might be you know adopted or foster children of someone 

260.01 260.90 A: yeah 

267.14 268.12 A: mhm 

268.76 270.00 B: and um 

271.17 273.63 B: you know we i i think 

274.43 280.33 B: because of um the fact that i you know not too long ago graduated from high school 

280.59 288.78 B: and it was kind of embarrassing having to read certain types of ah reading material that the teacher picked out that was very explicit 

289.20 296.64 B: and uh i would go home and i would tell you know my folks i i would be like you know they have us reading this stuff in class 

296.93 298.21 B: (( and ah )) 

299.23 306.00 B: and it wasn't the classics i mean it was stuff that dealt with sex and things like that and um 

303.86 304.84 A: mhm 

306.63 309.89 B: and i think there was just some things that are unappropriate 

309.89 313.45 A: well see more so now th- those type of i- 

314.00 321.96 A: it's getting i think within the last couple of years most of that those books unless it's a higher grade level are not to be 

322.28 324.80 A: (( read you know um )) 

323.10 324.21 B: mhm 

325.79 330.66 A: but they're they're trying to they're trying to stay away from now uh 

330.69 331.96 A: violence 

331.67 332.60 B: mhm 

332.20 333.44 A: (( but you know what )) 

333.66 340.78 A: an- and it's really strange you can't stay away from violence because like we said romeo and juliet there's violence in that book 

338.61 339.46 B: mhm 

340.44 341.36 B: right 

341.11 342.21 A: you know 

342.22 348.60 A: and it it seems like there's violence there's sex in in all the books and see when i was growing up 

348.80 352.87 A: because i come from a a service background um 

353.28 357.17 A: [mn] half the time i was in public school the other half i was in private school 

356.74 357.63 B: mhm 

357.36 358.60 A: you know in 

358.78 360.82 A: but in private school 

361.20 365.70 A: um i was dealing with a lot more of ah 

365.97 370.74 A: religious materials opposed to you know um 

367.70 368.58 B: right 

370.83 373.82 A: there's a log- there's a logical you know um 

374.15 375.98 A: books and stuff like that 

376.17 377.14 A: like 

377.24 380.68 A: you know we weren't in in private school we weren't allowed 

380.78 382.92 A: to read to kill a mocking bird 

383.37 386.47 A: you know and and uh public school is yes um 

387.71 390.92 A: but it it's really hard 

390.95 392.47 A: you know um 

393.86 400.76 A: to say because i know you know the curriculum nowadays is a lot is getting to be a lot more strict 

399.54 401.76 B: mhm right and 

400.85 403.91 A: ah but they're trying to stay away from the violence 

403.45 406.95 B: mhm and people's standards are different too 

404.19 405.06 A: you know 

407.37 412.31 B: um it's just like you know some some families will allow their kids to listen to 

407.50 408.75 A: yeah 

412.33 415.05 B: you know violent sounding music for example 

415.04 416.42 A: mhm 

415.18 419.85 B: um whereas you know other families you know they stay away from that completely 

419.83 420.73 A: right 

420.24 424.85 B: and ah you know it's a lot of a lot of issues to look at 

424.96 436.02 B: um i think when it comes to reading materials um in the public school system i think there should be a whole lot more parent teacher um communication 

436.51 438.66 B: in regards to things like that 

439.56 442.63 A: ye- yeah as far as parent teachers uh 

442.96 444.00 A: you know 

444.01 447.71 A: the- them talking it's a lot easier to do that 

447.07 448.04 B: (( um mhm )) 

447.74 451.01 A: when your child is at elementary school 

450.87 451.86 B: yeah 

451.23 456.02 A: and and junior high but when you get into the high schools um 

456.22 460.64 A: i mean you can talk to the teachers and all that but as far as really 

460.77 465.64 A: completing as far as the curriculum goes it's a lot harder 

465.28 466.27 B: (( mhm right mhm right )) 

466.01 466.98 A: um 

467.00 474.85 A: because they've got a lot more to deal with because they're dealing with um they're getting ki- kids prepped for college 

475.20 478.56 A: you know and if you read a certain book then 

479.03 485.66 A: what they're gearing towards is if you are reading this book now and if you go to college more than likely you'll end up reading it again 

486.19 487.31 A: (( you know )) 

487.37 488.49 A: but 

489.30 493.38 A: to me if you're gonna if you're gonna read a book and you want 

493.58 497.76 A: you know to get the point across the book needs to at least have some 

498.68 500.27 A: kind of ah 

501.32 503.18 A: (( [lipsmack] oh i don't know um )) 

503.25 513.13 A: enthusiasm in it you know otherwise you can have a child you know sit there reading maybe one page a night and falling asleep 

504.70 505.63 B: (( mhm right )) 

513.67 523.82 A: you know um but yeah like the classics romeo and juliet and the mythology book that she had to read too i mean some of the english language in that 

523.97 525.64 A: it was really hard 

525.45 526.34 B: mhm 

526.10 528.68 A: you know it was and um 

529.63 532.68 A: well the english language to begin with is hard anyways 

532.41 533.36 B: mhm 

533.12 537.27 A: you know but uh you know it is um i feel 

537.63 538.55 A: that 

538.74 540.85 A: you know it's a lot easier 

540.99 542.19 A: if 

542.74 547.59 A: they would ask for our opinions on what books through the throughout the year 

547.42 548.42 B: mhm 

548.17 549.13 A: you know 

549.26 550.12 A: um 

550.20 552.18 A: instead of just 

552.44 555.08 A: here you're reading this book this semester 

555.31 556.40 B: right 

555.64 557.89 A: you know and you don't have any say so in it 

557.52 558.67 B: mhm 

558.41 565.93 A: you know by that point you know all the t- other students in you know in the whole school district have uh you know on the same curriculum 

566.53 568.61 A: (( you know and so you don't have )) 

568.79 571.06 A: a way of censoring anything 

571.89 573.00 B: (( yeah )) 

572.05 577.65 A: and unless a parent and some parents unfortunately some parents have not read 

577.77 580.68 A: some of the books that the students are reading 

581.09 585.00 A: so they have no way of censoring it unless they read it afterwards 

585.41 595.47 A: you know and i feel that if they're going to have a student read a book at least ask the parent well have you read this book if not you know um 

595.62 599.89 A: you could get a copy here so you could read it along with your student so you can understand 

598.85 599.62 B: (( right ))
