57.10 59.32 A: everybody else was doing it and if you didn't

184.21 184.96 A: yeah 

184.36 184.94 B: but uh 

185.32 185.91 B: uh i mean 

186.08 190.58 B: what made me more sensitive to smoking i have a c- some friends that smoke my stepdad smokes and 

191.53 194.26 B: so i've i've been around it i just don't like it but 

194.37 199.74 B: with the girls now that we go out to certain restaurants like one of our favorite restaurants here is also a a bar 

200.58 201.14 B: and 

201.24 205.27 B: they have like a three or four foot wall separating the bar from the dining area and the smoke just 

205.36 208.62 B: drifts across and we we won't we won't go back now because 

206.20 206.58 A: mhm 

208.76 210.34 B: little girls inhaling that 

210.83 212.06 B: as we sit there and we don't 

211.99 212.36 A: right 

212.40 213.93 B: we decided we didn't like that so 

213.70 216.60 A: right well when i take when my boys out and we go to restaurants 

217.21 218.63 A: and it's just us 

219.10 221.26 A: we we don't sit in the smoking section 

221.78 223.50 A: if i either go out to eat with somebody 

223.68 226.68 A: i never sit in a smoking section i never i always respect 

227.53 229.00 A: it's just never a question 

229.21 229.62 B: right 

229.22 232.08 A: you know if they don't smoke i don't even think about it but 

232.60 234.34 A: now if we go somewhere with my husband 

234.99 236.21 A: that's a little different 

236.62 237.08 A: um 

237.54 238.59 B: is he a smoker as well 

238.65 239.70 A: yeah he is 

239.88 242.42 A: and i i don't know if he could handle it 

242.63 243.03 A: so 

243.24 244.27 A: we always sit 

245.06 247.27 A: in the smoking section whenever he's around 

247.90 248.34 A: oh 

249.89 253.62 A: but the kids don't like it and they will complain and i don't mind that they complain 

254.61 255.01 A: uh 

255.45 258.42 A: if they were a little older i'd give them the choice to go sit somewhere else 

258.60 259.10 A: you know 

259.21 259.64 B: yeah 

259.83 264.69 A: and but and i don't want my influence or our influence onto them i'm hoping that they'll 

265.53 266.75 A: do the opposite 

267.02 268.20 B: you know i've i've actually 

268.90 271.83 B: most of the the kids that i grew up with whose parents smoked 

272.90 273.34 B: i mean i 

273.51 275.45 B: i can't say that i ran a test or anything with 

275.99 276.63 B: statistics but 

276.73 277.69 B: from what i remember 

278.11 280.89 B: most of the kids that had smoking parents grew up disliking it 

281.46 287.47 B: and it was the kids who thought it was glamorous or were pressured into it that didn't that had no experience in it that kind of got sucked in 

287.71 288.15 A: mhm 

289.12 290.25 A: well i had um 

290.40 292.10 A: you know like i said i think a lot of mine was 

292.21 298.63 A: peer pressure and trying to fit in somewhere is how it started and then with my my parents my my daddy smoked when i was real little 

298.94 303.23 A: but he had quit so i was never around it from them but because my parent 

303.53 304.03 A: they were 

304.18 307.94 A: it was constantly you know it was definitely a house divided against itself 

308.73 309.41 A: so 

309.62 312.12 A: my respect for my i don't know my parents and 

312.60 315.34 A: for their wishes for me to abide by the time 

315.96 319.50 A: smoking was something that i knew they didn't like and knew knew it wouldn't condone which 

320.40 323.44 A: you know i guess being rebellious you know i never smoked around them 

323.57 323.99 B: right 

324.32 324.80 A: um 

325.06 327.89 A: but if they'd leave i'll you know i would go outside and smoke and (( )) 

328.03 329.54 A: if they smelled it you know they'd 

329.66 330.41 A: (( )) see it 

331.23 331.75 A: but um 

332.91 333.33 A: well 

333.69 335.28 A: fifteen (( )) years later 

335.64 337.61 B: yeah so have you ever tried to quit 

338.32 338.93 A: um 

339.30 341.24 A: only when i wasn't pregnant because 

341.43 342.29 A: the smell 

342.79 343.20 B: mhm 

343.14 344.29 A: would just make me throw up 

344.47 346.19 A: like i could never be around somebody that 

344.48 345.06 B: did you smoke 

346.30 346.64 A: smoke 

346.94 348.38 B: so did you smoke during pregnancy 

348.54 349.10 A: no 

349.29 350.08 A: i i think the 

350.20 351.65 A: you know before the first 

352.55 353.47 A: before you really knew 

354.19 356.20 B: right so the first the first two months 

354.26 355.15 A: that you were pregnant 

355.45 356.11 A: yeah but 

356.27 362.19 A: after that though i you know i had morning sickness so bad and everything with the even fried food i couldn't go into restaurants 

356.37 356.88 B: (( )) 

362.85 364.38 A: i'm a i was just that sensitive 

364.65 365.02 B: right 

365.26 366.85 A: anything would make me throw up 

366.90 367.45 B: yeah 

368.21 368.86 B: well um 

368.99 369.66 B: so you've 

370.06 370.83 B: you've never 

371.29 373.54 B: having never attempted to smoke do you have an opinion on 

374.66 377.75 B: programs or nicorettes or things like that that try to help people quit or 

377.39 379.48 A: i've never tried any of that my husband and i 

379.81 381.55 A: had talked about trying something 

382.39 382.94 A: um 

384.62 386.68 A: we used to smoke in the house so we had 

387.02 389.26 A: which is really kind of a recent thing that we've done 

389.53 392.42 A: it's not smoke in the house to get us to try to cut down because we do 

392.96 393.97 A: plan on quitting 

394.09 398.51 A: and we're going through a lot of remodeling with the house and we and we just don't want any of that in the house 

399.02 400.28 A: let alone you know around the kids 

400.79 401.19 B: right 

401.60 405.59 A: so we're trying to do it but i think we're going to try to do it on our own 

406.58 409.04 A: i don't know we may need i've never tried the patch 

409.77 410.12 B: okay 

411.02 411.62 B: yeah i i've 

412.10 412.54 B: just 

412.11 412.88 A: or any other 

413.10 413.67 B: my 

414.67 415.56 B: non 

415.69 417.42 B: expert opinion is that uh 

418.69 420.15 B: they don't seem to be too effective 

420.27 421.15 B: that um 

420.29 423.90 A: right well that's why we haven't tried it and my husband is a surgical nurse so 

422.06 422.72 B: yeah it's like 

424.41 425.02 A: uh we could get 

425.18 426.71 A: prescrip- you know -scripts to 

426.91 428.59 A: of the over the counter stuff and we just 

429.36 431.13 A: i think we know that we have to do it when 

431.74 433.45 A: our will is strong enough to complete it 

434.81 437.26 B: so what what's going to make your will strong enough to complete it 

437.78 439.23 A: i don't know 

440.42 443.06 A: i don't know it's very hard see i don't have to smoke 

444.00 449.40 A: and i can go i can go without smoking but when my husband's around it's very hard for me and i'm not trying to put the blame on him 

449.81 451.96 A: that's where my will comes in too i realize that 

452.22 454.12 B: well i'm i understand that my wife and i 

453.47 453.95 A: it just 

454.42 455.94 B: bounce off of each other like 

456.09 458.14 B: you know we'll say we're really going to get in shape 

458.01 458.62 A: yeah 

458.39 459.03 B: and um 

459.48 460.90 B: you know we get started and then 

461.33 463.13 B: uh we get busy instead of 

464.22 468.76 B: you know getting onto each other one person slides or one person goes hey i want a brownie and the other goes okay 

468.65 469.25 A: yeah 

469.38 470.87 B: instead of going no you can't have a brownie 

471.11 471.47 A: yeah 

472.50 473.38 B: completely understand that 

473.61 474.23 B: you do kind of 

474.85 477.70 B: want to please and go with the easy route 

478.01 482.95 A: well when they're right there kind of you know and for a smoker someone will grab a cigarette when they're 

483.49 485.08 A: feeling stress come upon them 

485.31 485.71 B: right 

486.05 487.52 A: or you know paying bills 

487.95 491.21 A: or whatever and so that's that's one reason why we're not doing it in the house anymore and 

491.30 491.71 B: mhm 

491.73 493.20 A: so we've made a lot of changes 

494.43 495.48 A: we're trying to better 

495.58 496.50 A: things right now 

497.92 499.42 A: in our household so 

499.57 501.17 A: i mean we're not even um 

502.16 504.94 A: watching t._v. i know it's going to sound stupid but 

505.37 506.59 A: i mean we've made a fixed month 

507.24 507.62 A: thing 

507.76 509.50 A: to where we're not going to watch t._v. 

507.95 508.35 B: (( )) 

508.45 508.88 B: i 

509.69 512.18 B: i grew up not watching t._v. i don't find that stupid at all 

512.75 513.88 A: yeah well you know 

512.88 514.20 B: we we waste a lot of time 

514.38 516.18 A: the kid i can see it rubbing off on the kid 

517.06 519.35 A: and we had punished them for two weeks
