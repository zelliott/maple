21.25 22.55 B: in schools right 

22.84 26.51 B: okay and whether or not schools have the right to 

25.23 28.24 A: we we should be uh have the right to do that yes 

27.61 28.49 B: okay 

29.19 42.01 B: ah well i guess i feel that it it kind of depends on the book and what it is if it's a classic book like tom sawyer i i don't think they have the right to to censor that 

44.01 57.42 A: okay um well it's ironic because i spoke to someone the computer called me twice on the same topic yeah i just spoke to someone about an hour ago and we were just talking about um you know the um 

50.53 51.46 B: oh really 

57.58 61.32 A: the uh same subject and we kind of felt that um 

61.43 62.26 A: um 

62.29 63.66 A: it was um 

63.92 73.61 A: a sort of a good thing for the ah schools to censor the books because a lot of times the um students um are not exposed to 

73.73 74.75 A: um 

75.06 78.50 A: as many um areas of life um 

78.59 85.71 A: that they could be exposed to by learning you know some of the classics and and uh um [cough] 

86.16 88.55 A: reading about all kinds of topics 

88.56 90.42 A: and understanding um 

90.53 91.46 A: um 

91.59 95.20 A: ah other cultures and and um 

95.58 99.03 A: um you know understanding some of the things that happen 

99.27 107.07 A: um you know to society and uh why society you know is the way it is today and and um 

107.62 112.57 A: you know and i kind of felt she and i both kind of felt the same way in terms of 

112.91 116.40 A: if they don't know about a lot of things if the ins- 

116.51 120.61 A: if the school does not expose them then are how they going to ever learn 

120.38 122.75 B: [mn] mhm right i yes that's 

122.89 128.59 B: that's kind of the way i i feel feel too if it's ah you know a uh classic work 

125.35 126.30 A: mhm 

128.29 129.24 A: (( mhm )) 

128.66 130.29 B: ah 

131.32 135.36 B: there's no i don't think there's any reason to censor ideas 

135.58 136.57 A: mhm 

135.91 143.51 B: um and even and even words um depending on depending on the context 

143.31 144.28 A: mhm 

145.09 150.10 A: okay but i thought they were in in terms of books are are you talking about in terms of 

150.70 156.26 A: th- the the the things that are written in the books y- uh the the ideas in the 

156.28 158.63 A: and you know are you just talking about 

158.90 166.83 A: the books themselves in terms of what they what they suggest that these students read and learn 

166.79 171.01 B: um i don't i don't think i don't think the ideas 

171.15 174.43 B: should be censored i i i guess i'm not 

174.81 175.65 B: ah 

176.16 181.31 B: i think i follow your line of thought that that that it's 

181.42 182.32 B: if 

182.84 186.71 B: um given the two choices i would rather not censor 

186.82 187.76 B: or 

188.00 194.79 B: or i would rather err on the side of exposing them to something rather than trying to protect them right yeah 

194.22 198.46 A: right right and and and we- you know uh 

199.09 201.77 A: we we both kind of felt that 

201.87 202.70 A: um 

202.75 204.83 A: a lot of the students um 

204.92 206.04 A: nowadays 

206.47 208.96 A: don't know how to um 

209.46 217.30 A: um interpret a lot of things don't understand a lot of things don't know much about any other culture all they know is 

217.31 229.62 A: is what you know they put more emphasis on music and sports than they do on learning about life and and learning about like i said other cultures other civilizations 

224.99 226.02 B: (( right right )) 

229.57 240.22 A: uh learning about history where we came you know what what happened in the past how can we study the past to to learn how to make the future a little better if we don't 

239.41 253.68 B: well yeah so much of so much of those ideas and and and concepts like that are are are also to help them teach teach them how to learn and how to accept others and [mn] how to view others and and not 

251.82 253.51 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

253.99 255.03 B: um 

256.31 258.42 B: argh what am i what am i trying to say they're 

260.09 274.55 B: they're like you said exposing them to different ideas and and and different vantage points but it's also also too it's helping them t- to try to learn that it's okay to form their own thoughts and their own opinions about things 

264.05 265.09 A: mhm 

266.36 267.57 A: mhm 

272.55 278.38 A: that's right that's right and also not to just accept anything that's said you know some 

278.40 282.59 A: in a lot of times we'd be we just because we someone 

282.86 286.49 A: you know has a p- a particular philosophy about the way 

286.35 299.05 A: a certain thing should be done that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to agree with it that you should have your own formulate your own ideas and your own opinions about a lot of things and also um question 

289.87 291.04 B: no right 

299.66 301.62 A: you know you know uh uh 

301.13 302.16 B: right 

302.58 309.19 A: the lady that i spoke to earlier she was just saying that um some of them have no idea why we why we're in this war 

309.37 314.63 A: uh can't think can't don't you know they don't understand anything don't even know what's going on 

314.68 316.71 A: um um 

317.47 324.98 A: ah because we don't they don't they don't really take time to try to read and try to learn as much as they possibly can 

324.38 336.19 B: right mhm right and and yeah like like we we just said it's important for them to try to learn that that opinions that they form are just as valid as opinions that someone else has written 

335.91 339.52 A: written that's right or what someone else has told them in terms of 

338.45 339.19 B: right 

339.33 347.88 B: yeah just because somebody can sit at a typewriter and put their thoughts down doesn't mean that their thoughts hold any more water than what a seventeen year old's thoughts are mhm 

347.60 349.23 A: right right 

349.48 350.90 A: so um 

351.38 357.08 A: and and we were just thinking in terms of of of of um learning about um 

357.34 359.81 A: ah just life in general 

359.82 365.40 A: work ethics you know um what it really you know what what it really 

366.19 380.79 A: what people really had to go through in terms of working we were just thinking in terms of parents giving their kids everything not understanding what it is to get out there and and and and um and really work 

381.25 386.55 A: um and [mn] we're going back to learning about the past 

386.87 392.50 A: uh you know and um um because you you hear a lot of people s- a lot of young people saying 

393.12 398.39 A: oh i wouldn't do that or i couldn't do that or i'm not going to do that um 

398.44 404.36 A: you know um or i didn't underst- i didn't realise that we had to go through this or 

404.42 418.92 A: did they have to walk five miles to go to school you know they didn't they don't yeah if they didn't if you don't if you don't try to study what has happened oh i wouldn't dare walk five miles to go to school oh yes you would have in that you know during that time 

406.60 408.80 B: (( mm right right yeah )) 

411.57 412.34 B: right 

415.26 417.25 B: right well they just have to under- 

418.50 422.55 B: yeah people they just have to understand that people do what they have to do and 

421.97 423.38 A: right right 

422.93 425.22 B: and and they do what they have to do 

423.46 424.41 A: and 

425.27 428.19 B: when when they have to when it has to get done 

427.87 436.74 A: right right and like but if they don't understand what like if they don't read about what went on in the past if they don't 

436.77 439.03 A: you know understand some of the 

439.16 441.07 A: some of the the the 

441.13 442.39 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

442.87 450.57 A: you know the pitfalls and the problems and the good things and the bad things and and you know [mn] you know 

450.64 451.26 A: (( ah [lipsmack] )) 

451.40 452.74 A: and you know 

452.51 460.42 B: mhm well it's it's what's the old saying that ah those that don't learn history are are are doomed to re- 

460.64 461.35 B: re- 

461.90 463.56 B: repeat history 

463.06 465.39 A: right that's right that's right 

464.58 466.45 B: so [mn] you know there's 

466.66 477.63 B: [sigh] you know other other than thoughts and ideas from people that have have lived before us there's also we can learn from what what they've done right and also from what they've done wrong 

477.19 479.52 A: wrong that's right that's right 

479.62 481.55 A: so you know um 

482.30 485.06 A: and i guess that's one of the reasons why i i 

485.11 488.15 A: you know i just kind of think that you know 

488.26 493.11 A: they you know they should censor and and should um 

493.51 494.34 A: um 

495.80 496.84 A: you know 

497.00 500.90 A: help you know help students become more exposed 

500.17 501.02 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

501.08 503.55 A: to as much as they possibly can 

503.19 515.78 B: right well i mean yeah even even if ideas um even if the the ideas written by today's standards are wrong there's something to be learned about that about how times have changed even 

513.10 514.24 A: mhm 

515.16 520.55 A: that's right that's right that's right and we were talking about the fall of the roman empire 

520.92 522.95 A: and and um 

523.03 529.72 A: you know learning from that civilization which was one of the the the greatest civilizations untold 

530.00 535.72 A: and what went wrong there are we are we doing some of the same things that they did back in 

535.06 536.18 B: (( mhm hello ))
