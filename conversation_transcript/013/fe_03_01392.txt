71.84 75.35 A: oh i just say i do walk because it is healthy for you 

75.35 82.94 B: yeah and the main form of exercise i get is just walking um i work a part a just a part time job at a department store 

82.89 89.32 B: and i walk like around you know just hanging up clothes and stuff like that walking back and forth 

89.21 103.25 B: so i do that then i have a full time job in school so walking back and forth with school and stuff like that i mean even when i'm like say like today you know just get out and walk a little bit on my lunch break do stuff like that but as far as 

99.71 100.83 A: right 

103.22 108.09 B: going into a gym and stuff like that i really don't have time for it um 

108.21 115.33 B: but i was saying that even in in terms of exercise i would rather do something more like a karate or 

115.25 125.13 B: something that involves like other people instead of like when you go to the gym and you are just like working out by yourself and everything i would rather do something more interactive [noise] 

125.16 127.43 B: like a karate or kick 

127.71 130.73 B: what is it the kick boxing course or something like that 

131.56 132.58 A: right 

131.71 132.59 B: but 

132.68 134.46 B: other than that no 

135.17 144.36 B: so i mean i don't have time for it but i would like to get you know when i do get the time to do i would like to go to a gym and work out um 

144.56 148.36 B: and then i want to do something or go to a gym where they have like water aerobics 

148.38 155.86 B: because i can't swim and i want to learn how so even with that just doing the water aerobics in the water and stuff like that i think that'll be fine 

157.29 158.34 A: right 

158.37 159.14 A: [sigh] 

161.44 163.24 A: (( um )) 

161.77 165.56 B: now what other forms of exercise do you get i mean it's just 

165.97 168.92 A: oh what other form of exercise do i get [noise] 

171.68 172.64 A: hello 

171.92 173.33 B: hello yes 

173.11 184.29 A: i'm sorry that's my box um i would just say basically i just the only thing i do is just walk but if i could exercise i would just maybe i would just take up um 

185.86 193.26 A: [lipsmack] um basketball or something because basketball is a good exercise to take up you know because you're running this 

191.28 192.36 B: (( yeah )) 

193.32 194.13 A: (( is )) 

194.46 197.21 A: sweat you take on a lot of um 

197.93 202.06 B: i mean basketball is good like as far as cardio because it's good for your heart 

201.77 202.85 A: right 

202.27 204.45 B: so that would be good um 

204.90 208.40 B: (( i mean there are a lot of things that can be done and i don't think that )) 

209.02 213.12 B: you know just going into the gym is necessarily going to make someone healthy 

213.30 228.05 B: um i think it does have its have its benefit but yet and still i mean like there are people that go to gyms and they have heart attacks like on tread mills and stuff like that so just going to a gym does not does not necessitate or ah like 

221.85 222.82 A: (( yes )) 

228.16 234.21 B: like health or good health i mean it doesn't you know what i mean make someone healthy to go to a gym 

234.97 241.87 B: but um as far as having all the equipment to work out every part of your body they have that 

241.94 249.54 B: but other than that i mean [mn] if you can find something else a- as a more as opposed to going to a gym i would rather do that 

250.07 251.10 A: right 

251.21 257.22 B: so i mean i like it i like walking i mean i get a lot of walking in and that's basically what 

255.16 258.15 A: okay walking is the best exercise so 

258.15 260.49 B: yeah and i mean and i think then 

258.19 258.75 A: (( yeah )) 

260.58 265.23 B: y- you can exercise all you want but it depends upon what are you putting into your body 

265.45 266.85 B: you know so 

266.88 277.93 B: but i mean i don't eat health food and stuff like that i would like to [noise] but i'm always going and i'm always on the run so i just grab what i can 

278.01 280.44 B: and i'll have that but um 

280.81 290.63 B: i think health foods are you know something that's healthy is like very important because you defeat the whole purpose of you know exercising sometimes if you don't put the right things into your body 

290.90 291.87 A: right 

292.15 292.93 B: so 

292.98 295.55 B: i mean but other than that i mean that's what i 

295.64 297.53 B: i mean that's what i do 

297.61 300.21 B: so if you were to work out where would you work out at 

300.44 304.33 A: if i was to exercise i would probably 

305.43 310.94 A: um i would just walk like i generally do walking because i think walking is the best exercise that you can do 

311.03 322.33 A: because we do exercise i do exercise why do i walk because it's good exercise and that's the best way to exercise by walking because you're stretching everything your legs 

322.34 326.32 A: your arms your muscles your mind and your body 

326.56 330.10 A: you know that's the best exercise that you can do 

326.74 329.63 B: (( [noise] yeah yeah )) 

330.32 331.59 A: by walking 

332.28 333.79 B: yeah that 

332.46 335.92 A: walking helps everything your heart your lungs 

336.08 337.92 A: everything in your body 

336.17 337.05 B: (( and if )) 

337.65 341.39 B: it really does i mean and it's really you know it's really good and it's 

340.33 349.16 A: if you think about it you don't need any machine or anything cause basically your body is a machine for you to exercise and walking is the best one 

349.33 351.58 B: [noise] yeah walking is the b- i mean 

350.39 351.47 A: (( it )) 

352.02 356.58 B: it is the best and not only that i mean you could do it with friends and stuff like that i mean 

356.65 366.33 B: so you can really get out a- a lot out of walking even though with today being a nice day just being out being able to get out and take a walk i mean is like really refreshing you know 

366.37 367.69 A: (( is )) 

367.72 373.94 B: especially after being like in the house all winter long you're like just because you can't really enjoy it 

373.34 374.58 A: yeah 

373.97 378.47 B: you know and you didn't have really have the opportunity to get out and walk like you wanted to 

378.81 381.89 B: i mean and the only thing [noise] i mean i'm pretty healthy 

381.98 388.66 B: (( and you know i'm like pretty fit or whatever but the only thing that i would want to do if i had to do anything would be just to tone up my stomach )) 

388.95 390.91 B: i mean but that would be it 

388.99 390.00 A: okay 

391.19 392.11 A: right 

392.39 394.93 B: because i'm like pretty well fit and i mean 

395.31 401.64 B: i really don't need i mean i i feel like i really don't need to do anything right at right now [noise] 

400.36 401.32 A: okay 

402.82 403.78 B: so 

403.71 409.59 A: if you did exercise every day why would why do you exercise if you did 

408.58 409.42 B: why 

409.57 412.61 B: if i did why do i exercise why would i 

411.33 412.32 A: right 

413.20 415.99 B: i guess it would be for um [mn] 

416.28 420.44 B: actually if i did do it every day let's see 

420.84 423.00 B: i mean basically i guess for 

423.33 426.35 B: for me i guess it would just be personal right now i mean 

426.43 429.94 B: i could say health but then i might right now i might 

429.02 432.17 A: (( it would just be for a goal ah )) 

432.36 436.82 A: or just for health reasons or just for 

436.91 442.67 A: just to have people just say oh this lady exercise all the time 

438.46 439.75 B: probably for 

442.14 447.39 B: [noise] yeah i would say probably for a goal for me at this point it would be just be for a goal 

444.74 445.75 A: okay 

447.45 448.79 B: i mean now 

448.92 453.69 B: it would just be for a goal i mean just a personal goal i mean it wouldn't be for anybody else 

453.26 454.18 A: right 

453.75 462.68 B: i mean of course it would help like with health and all that but i mean and you need that and i'm like i'm pretty healthy but it would be for a personal goal not for um you 

462.82 467.62 B: know not just for somebody else to be like oh this person works out you know 

466.12 470.41 A: right some people do it for men attention you know why do they 

469.60 476.69 B: yeah see and that's not me i'm like i don't care and it's just like so it would just be personally for me 

470.54 471.55 A: (( you know )) 

476.90 477.79 A: right 

477.19 478.18 B: (( you know )) 

478.72 480.16 B: because i feel like this 

480.17 494.14 B: what happens after you after you have done all that and if it's not for you anyway and it's not satisfying to you it defeats the whole purpose i mean because who cares i mean they can walk away they can have like the perfect body and you know what i mean 

493.79 502.82 A: right if you're not exercising for yourself then what difference does it make but a lot of people don't exercise for their self they do it for other people 

496.01 497.30 B: exactly 

497.70 499.15 B: because not something 

500.93 502.41 B: yeah and it's not 

502.98 510.67 B: yeah and who's to say that they're still going to be satisfied with the body that you get afterwards you know so it has to be for you it has to be something personal 

506.85 507.75 A: yeah 

510.27 511.74 A: mhm 

510.96 516.54 B: so i take it more personal i'm like because i don't care as long as i'm happy with me then that's all that matters 

516.65 526.36 B: you know and i mean i've just always felt like that it doesn't matter how anybody else feels about me as long as i'm happy with my weight and stuff like that i can say it doesn't matter 

526.46 536.25 B: i mean even though i'm healthy and i'm fit you know stuff like that i would just tone up my stomach but it doesn't come from exercise i guess it's just because i have a fast metabolism 

526.54 529.89 A: yeah yeah see i would if i did exercise 

530.30 534.17 A: i would exercise i'd do i would exercise for ga- 

535.50 536.51 A: right 

538.27 550.73 A: see i d- i burn up a lot and i'm i'm a real small person so i when i if i did exercise i wo- probably would burn off all my body fat because there's really that much not body fat on me but 

550.50 556.95 A: if i did exercise run and jog i probably would sweat a lot and you know that is like when i eat 

557.59 560.83 A: i don't gain no weight or anything it's just 

561.63 564.16 A: s- that my body weight stays the same 

564.55 568.20 A: so if i exercise it basically would be just for tone it's 

568.78 570.33 A: not to lose weight 

570.49 575.38 A: you know some people exercise to lose weight some people exercise to gain 

575.39 580.31 A: i mean like to lose it some people do it to tone their bodies 

588.05 589.56 A: did we get clicked off
