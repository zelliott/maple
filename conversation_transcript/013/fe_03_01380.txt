3.03 5.22 B: hi my name's phyllis 

5.20 6.67 A: hi i'm alison 

6.73 11.36 B: i pr- i pressed the wrong button because it asked you if a cellphone or a um 

11.86 15.77 B: a cordless phone and i pressed the wrong one [laughter] i don't know if it makes any difference 

14.34 15.34 A: (( oh )) 

16.05 19.93 B: um w- i i didn't understand the question did you hear it clearly mm 

16.22 17.43 A: i don't think so 

19.64 22.42 A: um i think that it was just um 

22.57 27.75 A: talking about cens- censorship and if private or public schools have the right to 

27.77 30.84 A: um have ch- children read certain books 

31.74 33.28 B: that's a good topic 

33.07 34.52 A: [laughter] 

33.75 37.91 B: are you a mom or a grandmom or you sound too young to be a grandmother 

35.76 37.45 A: uh no 

37.81 41.11 A: (( yeah i'm a freshman in college actually [laughter] um well let's see i feel that ))

43.09 45.50 A: ((  )) 

46.61 48.49 B: [lipsmack] how do you feel about that 

47.49 55.43 A: ((  )) 

55.96 56.90 A: (( kids i )) 

58.04 67.79 A: ((  )) 

67.86 69.98 A: (( about it at least you know if if it's )) 

70.17 73.63 B: um as parent and a grandmother i disagree 

73.74 78.61 B: i don't think that a bunch of teachers should have the right to decide what your kid reads 

78.58 93.05 B: um i think that a curriculum ought to be presented to the parents ahead of time so that they know what their child is gonna read there's a lot of things that kids are reading and hearing in school these days that are totally opposite of what their parents want 

93.64 96.63 B: and i believe that the parents have priority 

96.89 101.89 B: over the teachers i don't believe that teachers have been given our s- our children 

102.20 105.99 B: you know uh my grandchildren are all in a private school 

106.32 111.83 B: um so we know what they're reading and and um what they're hearing and 

111.87 122.71 B: um i don't believe that some teacher can just come up and assign your child something that could be totally out of his sphere that he wouldn't have anything to plug it into it could be a 

122.82 128.93 B: [lipsmack] immoral book i- and that's all relative according to a lot of people it could um 

129.46 130.27 B: um 

131.59 134.11 B: it could set the stage for family 

134.51 136.40 B: um disharmony 

136.65 141.25 B: because their the parents have taught them one thing and they're learning another in school 

141.89 148.35 A: (( a young child they'll bring it back and they'll say you know mom grandma you know what does this mean and you know at least )) 

148.49 149.58 B: right 

148.57 153.06 A: (( it gives you a chance to explain why you don't believe that or why you do )) 

153.24 156.97 A: (( a what there are now assignments in public school where )) 

156.98 157.87 A: kids 

158.47 165.37 A: (( are told not to tell their parents that they had it that there are questionnaires that the kids have about families that they are told )) 

165.33 175.17 A: ((  )) 

173.84 177.39 B: do you know there's actually assignments in class where the kids are told 

179.15 180.06 A: (( the parents )) 

180.14 181.31 B: (( they are not )) 

183.56 184.51 B: (( to tell )) 

186.32 187.46 B: (( their )) 

193.38 194.27 A: (( there there are so )) 

194.91 198.13 A: ((  )) 

211.49 212.62 B: parents 

213.28 214.84 B: (( weird [laughter] that's )) 

215.27 216.19 B: (( weird )) 

220.13 221.02 A: (( unacceptable what's )) 

220.24 225.95 B: and those children are just little fragile minds innocent naive 

226.00 232.00 B: and for people to expose them they have sex education classes in kindergarten 

232.01 238.99 B: where certain groups of people are coming in and making presentations to five year olds about sex when they should be out playing in a sand box 

238.52 242.11 A: moral what's immoral okay [laughter] that is really weird i didn't know that 

241.75 251.05 B: yeah there's a lot going on and a lot there's a lot in fact there's a whole grass roots movement of parents and and grandparents and and some teachers and 

251.15 262.36 B: um people who are really concerned about what's going on in private in public schools in fact there is a huge movement to pull them out and put them in uh home schools home schools are gaining more credibility all the time 

263.01 263.67 A: mm 

264.23 265.30 A: interesting 

265.23 273.64 B: you know but i i still believe that the parents should have the final say over what the children are exposed to when they're adult they can make whatever adult decisions they want 

273.61 274.38 A: right 

274.15 275.05 B: you know 

276.11 276.89 B: um 

278.24 278.80 A: (( [noise] )) 

278.84 279.72 A: uh 

278.88 279.72 B: you know 

280.50 285.35 B: we talk to my grandchildren you know when certain issues come up we talk to them 

285.40 295.68 B: but we plug it into something that gives them a foundation we don't just throw a crazy idea out there that scares them to death my little three year old granddaughter is in a in a daycare 

295.80 301.70 B: and uh they're reading books about monsters she's never learned about monsters at home 

300.44 302.57 A: oh [laughter] 

301.67 314.15 B: she's terrified of monsters she sees monsters in closets monsters in an empty dog kennel she sees monsters out under her bed she learned this in daycare who gave them the right to bring up monsters 

307.02 308.20 A: [laughter] 

314.34 319.33 B: why aren't they playing with baby dolls and tea sets and little toy trucks and things like that 

319.30 321.02 A: (( oh poor kid )) 

320.97 324.30 B: yeah i mean she looks under her bed for shoes and there's a monster 

324.19 325.33 A: [laughter] 

325.33 328.47 B: somebody needs to be making decisions 

328.54 334.68 B: based uh you know and that's my daughter in law's fault you know she should be checking out what they're 

334.76 335.77 B: um 

336.15 337.38 B: (( [lipsmack] uh )) 

337.62 343.05 B: my son is a single parent you know but his wi- ex wife put her in this daycare 

343.14 346.44 B: and she doesn't check to see what they're learning there 

346.55 348.88 B: you know but katy's terrified 

349.15 354.58 B: and so i i believe that certain books should be censored i believe the parents should have a right to censor them 

354.77 359.24 B: saying my child is not ready for this or i don't want my child exposed to this 

358.93 360.98 A: uh huh yeah well what grade do you believe 

361.10 365.28 A: maybe that should be lifted that censorship or never 

366.53 377.08 B: i think it depends on you know there are certain things books that my grandchildren see in uh in their private school they go to a christian school that public schools wouldn't allow 

378.17 378.96 A: right 

378.29 385.82 B: you know and so censorship what's right and wrong is in the hands of those who have authority 

385.97 386.92 B: you know 

386.82 387.66 A: (( uh huh )) 

386.95 389.52 B: you have to have something that you base it on 

389.98 400.53 B: there's a reason we've got them in a private school because of what they're learning in public school and not learning my my second grade grandchild can read as good an eighth grader because she's learning phonics 

400.69 401.58 A: mhm 

401.32 412.39 B: you know but they're not teaching that in public school so i really believe you know [mn] the constitution places a child in the ri- in the hands of the parents not in the hands of the teachers 

412.34 417.97 B: and i really believe that's where it belongs and i believe the parents should have a right to see the curriculum 

418.29 422.55 B: [lipsmack] what books are gonna be used what uh subject matter is gonna be brought up 

422.77 425.91 B: you know if it's anything other than reading writing and arithmetic 

426.99 431.88 B: you know but i'm coming from sixty years of parenting and grand parenting 

431.76 432.68 A: (( [laughter] )) 

433.59 434.49 A: true 

434.85 435.63 A: um 

437.30 438.80 A: let's see uh 

439.71 443.35 A: i guess i don't have as much experience i suppose but 

443.57 446.20 A: it does make sense that there should be some 

446.38 455.67 A: type of well even in public schools you can still if you're a parent you can still go in and you know ask about that kind of stuff and see because i started out in uh 

455.83 461.87 A: private school up 'til about fourth grade and then i moved so then i went to public school but 

462.24 464.31 A: i believe you know i learned 

464.47 469.92 A: i think i was ahead when i because i was in private school but that's also a lot of money and uh 

469.98 482.93 B: it is a lot of money but you ha- your kids are that important but you know um it's that important to us different people have different values it's that important to us there's four of them so you can imagine how expensive that is 

470.07 470.76 A: (( you know )) 

473.40 474.47 A: right 

481.74 484.53 A: yeah that's a lot of money [laughter] 

484.06 498.06 B: that is a lot of money but there are also and i have seen these too where the national teachers' association actually has a book on how to handle parents that are upset that come in protesting about something being read or discussed 

498.95 502.94 B: and so they put the parent off a certain way 

503.44 510.82 B: and so they they censor the parent from the from the curriculum and separate them from what their child is learning 

512.19 513.12 B: you know 

513.20 516.76 B: um a when i was growing up i was in a public school 

516.81 521.85 B: there were no options and my parents wouldn't have cared if there was an option i was put in a public school 

522.23 523.60 B: and 

523.68 526.64 B: i learned things and read certain books 

525.31 525.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

527.10 538.03 B: that i had never been exposed to and it it screwed me up you know it it gave me nightmares it it did all sorts of things it's like i i wasn't ready to talk about these subjects 

538.45 550.04 B: [lipsmack] and um i understand little katy at three [laughter] you know that's terrified of she sees monsters everywhere you have to constantly reassure her and she never was exposed to that because we didn't read about 

542.35 543.20 A: [laughter] 

550.20 553.09 B: pretend creatures that were gonna grab her 

553.16 554.06 A: yeah 

553.54 554.48 B: you know 

555.54 557.36 B: so i really um 

557.67 560.70 B: [lipsmack] i'm concerned you know one school will censor 

560.81 563.36 B: um you know uh 

564.19 570.14 B: a book you know that has anything to do ab- that if it vaguely approaches god a public school will 

570.35 572.28 B: but a private school will 

572.32 573.97 B: censor a book about 

574.03 575.61 B: sexual immorality 

575.85 576.87 A: right 

576.64 582.72 B: you know so i think i think pri- uh schools should have the right to 

583.71 588.26 B: i think parents should have the ultimate censorship right personally 

588.35 589.28 A: what if 

588.39 591.51 B: because most parents are good parents and love their children 

592.02 599.95 A: true but in a school you know a class of thirty students or you know twenty students all the parents have different decisions so
