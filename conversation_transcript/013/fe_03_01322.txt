22.82 24.19 B: well 

23.20 24.55 A: i think they should

28.16 29.26 A: oh okay 

28.74 29.99 B: and uh

33.42 34.67 A: yeah 

34.48 46.69 B: and you think you know that has got to help you that's gotta hinder your health as well just just smelling that and i think especially with uh young children in place- in public places 

40.49 41.83 A: yeah that's true 

46.08 47.65 A: yeah 

47.51 54.84 B: that we have to worry about them i don't know what do you think about the the hotlines and things like that 

55.04 56.48 A: the hotlines 

56.77 61.27 B: i'm i've seen them here in utah where they have like hotlines 

61.41 65.96 B: people who they treat it just like an addiction of anything you know you can get uh 

66.25 69.53 B: you can call for help if you have a smoking problem 

67.99 74.20 A: oh yeah yeah i think that's pretty good 'cause it helps you know people that are addicted to 

74.32 78.15 A: other types of drugs as well as cigarettes [laughter] 

77.75 79.10 B: right 

78.30 79.66 A: yeah so 

79.47 83.06 B: i mean i think it's nice that it's now getting more attention as a real drug 

83.55 85.17 B: than it used to 

85.25 86.89 A: okay yeah 

87.01 87.89 B: (( uh how )) 

87.12 89.60 A: are you're calling from the state of utah 

89.22 90.61 B: i am 

89.87 92.36 A: wow i'm in georgia 

91.94 93.08 B: in georgia 

92.70 93.65 A: mhm 

93.31 95.28 B: i have a roommate from there [sigh] 

95.54 100.10 B: um and how how are the anti smoking laws in georgia 

100.24 104.22 A: well right now they um ban you from smoking in public places 

104.80 113.26 A: so i don't know how the law is in utah but they just passed a law where you you can't smoke in public places in georgia 

113.59 118.91 B: that that's how it is in utah i believe at least every time i've gone into a restaurant i haven't seen any smoking 

118.03 119.40 A: yeah 

119.53 125.38 A: they just passed the law here in georgia so i think it's been passed now for about three months so 

125.17 127.23 B: was there a lot of opposition to it 

127.19 129.11 A: no not really 

128.93 130.03 B: not really 

129.58 134.47 A: 'cause a lot of people opposed you know smoking in public places and i was one of 'em so [laughter] 

134.93 136.22 B: (( well that's good )) 

135.69 136.78 A: yeah 

136.52 137.92 B: that's good 

138.17 139.66 B: (( um )) 

142.74 144.60 B: trying to think here [laughter] 

143.63 144.70 A: (( [noise] [laughter] [noise] )) 

145.60 146.81 B: um 

148.44 156.10 B: so which places does that affect does it uh is it all public places like for example does that affect um 

156.28 158.97 B: employ- uh employers 

157.65 164.57 A: well actually what what happened is the the the the companies won't be um fined 

164.46 174.64 A: what they're doing now they're just fining the people that are smoking that's what i was told so it was on the news so basically they've you know they catch you smoking in public places they'll fine you 

174.50 179.92 B: so a public place could also be like a company just like a private company 

176.73 177.48 A: like 

178.35 182.47 A: yeah like offices um restaurants and stuff like that 

183.35 184.68 B: that's good 

184.16 185.35 A: yeah 

184.74 187.11 B: then it doesn't make it awkward for employees who don't 

187.71 192.91 B: want that they don't have to feel like they're they've they're they were risking their job 

192.70 194.21 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

193.30 195.90 B: in speaking up against that 

196.79 198.00 B: um 

199.87 202.97 B: what how do you feel about uh 

204.05 207.29 B: how how effective do you think the the programs are for 

207.46 212.19 B: that are available for anti smoking like to help people stop smoking 

213.11 215.46 A: [noise] how effective do i think of what now 

215.41 218.57 B: (( like in the in the little prompt it talked about )) 

218.75 219.77 B: uh 

220.88 226.93 B: what we thought about pr- the the programs that are out there for that help people stop 

225.37 229.97 A: oh you mean as far as like the nicotine patch and all that well [sigh] 

230.36 234.83 A: mm that's a good question i'm not a smoker so i don't know um 

236.00 239.08 A: [noise] i think it's it's it's probably 

239.11 243.84 A: effective if you probably use it it you know if you use it properly 

243.89 247.62 A: um hm i haven't really gave it that much thought 

247.86 248.86 A: um 

249.75 258.18 B: yeah it th- this isn't something i've even much thought too either being a non smoker and it my family no one in my family smokes although my grandfather did smoke 

252.51 255.51 A: (( yeah )) 

258.13 259.17 A: wow 

258.25 260.15 B: he he quit 

260.25 262.75 B: but he went to chewing tobacco instead [laughter] 

261.21 268.56 A: well you know what i see a lot of com- commercials they have a lot of campaign- campaigns on t._v. about um you know like um 

268.78 277.43 A: like what what can cause you know what what what's the leading cause of cancer is from smoking and stuff like that have you seen those commercials 

276.56 278.10 B: i have 

277.51 281.18 A: yeah and they really talk about you know like um 

281.67 295.08 A: you know a lot um a lot of the tobacco companies are saying that um like back in the early sixties that that was the main cause of people catching cancer and now like they did a recent survey with the same company there's 

294.94 305.00 A: they're acting like they don't know what they're talking about as far as you know what they said about twenty years ago about tobacco you know is a is the main cause of cancer have you heard that um 

304.88 316.31 B: i heard a little bit of these these studies like the same ways that you're like through the t._v. and and through newspaper and i think that's good that it's getting out there and because it 

307.34 308.68 A: yeah 

313.90 315.34 A: yeah 

316.33 319.57 B: i think a lot of people saw s- smoking 

319.78 321.01 B: as 

321.88 334.12 B: it it wasn't a very serious thing and and granted it's not as serious as some of these harder drugs but i think it needs to be considered i'm i'm not talking about like 

324.07 325.77 A: mhm 

330.38 331.53 A: yeah 

332.97 337.30 A: because some of the ingredients they put in cigarettes you'd be amazed on what they put in there 

337.62 344.53 A: i mean they were naming some of the stuff i can't remember exactly but they put a lot of harmful stuff in there i mean you know 

345.25 346.36 A: [laughter] 

346.61 349.57 B: well it sounds it's nasty that people are taking this in 

349.32 351.35 A: yeah 

350.42 358.06 B: um yeah it i i think through these uh through the education people are getting through some of these public advertisements 

358.12 359.72 B: it will be good 

359.63 363.61 A: and one thing i'm glad that they don't do any more is like um 

363.83 366.72 A: basically market the cigarette brand like 

366.75 370.16 A: i used to see the cigarette brand like on um [lipsmack] 

370.31 381.61 A: like at the at the at the gas station and stuff they used to have like the the salem um like the um the billboard or whatever but i don't see that any more like i used to so 

381.82 392.82 A: i think that's a good thing as well so they're not marketing it like they used to but now what i'm noticing is a lot of young teenagers now are smoking have you noticed that in utah okay 

393.16 394.22 B: um 

394.26 400.23 B: i haven't noticed it so much in utah i'm also i'm i'm from texas i'm going out to sch- i'm here at school 

399.90 401.14 A: oh wow 

400.51 405.16 B: but i i have seen that in in texas and that's a little disconcerting 

404.97 406.19 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

405.46 407.39 B: and it 

407.71 414.80 B: it makes me wonder how effective is the the advertising campaigns 'cause i think now it's gotten to the point people know 

415.42 417.56 B: i mean maybe in the sixties 

417.91 420.22 B: the the people didn't know 

420.26 422.29 B: how harmful it was 

422.55 427.53 B: and now it concerns me kids that that know exactly what they're taking into themselves 

424.23 428.52 A: yeah yeah 

428.11 441.45 B: and i i guess you can't s- stop the the public awareness as saying okay well then the commercials aren't doing it i think that's good so people know when it's on them this time instead of as before smoking 

442.12 453.10 B: um we we have all these lawsuits against the cigarette companies saying you didn't tell us now it's gonna h- people are gonna have to have take their own personal responsibility if their health gets messed up 

453.06 457.13 B: they can't say no one told me that i was going to get cancer 

457.04 458.61 A: yeah that's true 

458.34 462.69 B: a- and i think that's a good thing we won't have any more of these lawsuits 

463.36 472.18 B: i don't not that i'm siding with the the cigarette companies saying that that they shouldn't be sued because i think what they did was despicable 

471.42 482.76 A: now have you have you ever been told that secondhand smoking is uh is is is more serious than than a person that smokes that you know actually smokes a cigarette have you ever been told that before or 

482.35 484.54 B: i haven't why would that be 

484.27 490.93 A: well i'm not really sure but i heard that before that like secondhand smoke if you're like inhaling a cigarette 

490.94 492.78 A: it's more um 

493.10 496.49 A: dangerous than a person that's actually smoking the cigarette 

497.26 498.31 B: huh 

498.77 507.45 A: yeah i heard that a lot of times so i don't know how i don't know how it how it's you know how they came up with that but i heard that before 

500.31 502.28 B: that's interesting 

507.99 512.32 B: i remember that i i i actually have heard that thinking about it now 

512.01 513.65 A: yeah 

512.55 515.78 B: and i'm trying to remember the reason and i can't off the top of my head 

515.90 519.08 B: and i think that's why they're passing all these laws there's a 

517.53 520.79 A: yeah and then a lot of uh i see a lot of like 

521.12 532.31 A: people smoke while they're pregnant and i think that is so disgusting i mean how can you inhale all that sm- and that's that's that's that's that's i can't i can't imagine someone doing that i mean 

532.46 541.61 A: it's like they don't have any consideration and it makes a lot of the kids that the parents that do smoke while they're pregnant the kids have like defects and stuff when they're born so 

541.19 542.50 B: yeah 

541.88 543.18 A: yeah so 

544.72 545.57 B: that's 

546.65 552.92 B: um yeah that's [sigh] i i understand the whole personal choice thing 

552.76 566.26 B: i don't agree that people should treat their bodies that way i think you know our bodies are are a special thing and and people need to know that that what they're doing to themselves is bad but people should not be allowed to hurt other people 

566.38 567.34 A: yeah 

567.26 579.47 B: and like they were talking a- about in the prompt the the these laws against that and i i'm i'm grateful for those [laughter] targeting a the 

577.09 578.30 A: yeah 

579.59 583.13 B: the targeting that especially 

583.35 587.65 B: getting out there and saying you c- you can hurt yourself but you can't hurt other people 

587.23 588.32 A: yeah 

588.16 591.79 B: um and what do you do for for pregnant women then 

591.92 595.12 B: 'cause that you know that's hurting someone else [laughter] 

594.62 596.64 A: what can you do for pregnant women 

596.16 599.89 B: yeah i wonder what you can do for that and say uh make it against the law to smoke
