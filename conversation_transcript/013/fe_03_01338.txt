11.68 14.31 B: okay so we can start talking about the topic 

14.60 17.16 A: yeah so what do you feel about that 

17.75 18.45 B: um 

19.14 20.49 B: well i think um 

21.91 23.75 B: i think that's a good thing to do 

24.33 35.68 B: i think cause here in america um there are many people who are doing kind of strange things and uh i'm sure companies don't want um 

25.83 26.09 A: hm 

35.80 38.27 B: those people who are 

38.46 44.34 B: like on drugs or something like that cause they might do something bad to the companies 

40.64 41.12 A: mhm 

44.50 45.03 B: so 

45.88 46.36 B: um 

47.12 48.41 B: what do you think 

48.30 51.81 A: so i think you know it's okay for me at least 

52.29 52.89 B: uh huh 

53.24 54.10 B: that's by 

53.31 55.37 A: yeah i think you know yeah 

55.73 59.71 A: but as a company can protect your privacy you know by 

60.09 63.54 A: not ah telling everyone the result you know 

64.20 66.12 A: just the company know 

66.29 70.57 A: do you use one i mean do you pass or fail in the drug test 

70.81 71.37 B: uh huh 

71.22 76.29 A: yeah okay that's just keep for the record not you know for everyone 

76.94 80.49 A: so i think that in this case it will be okay you know 

80.64 81.58 B: i think so 

81.40 84.71 A: so yeah it's kind of the company can 

85.70 87.95 A: take the drug test and uh 

88.29 90.42 A: you keep the privacy right 

90.36 91.16 B: that's right 

91.22 91.90 A: eh 

91.65 92.69 B: and i think 

92.83 93.39 B: i think 

93.56 97.58 B: companies i mean the the companies have the right to 

97.68 98.67 B: to you know 

99.03 99.44 A: yeah 

99.33 101.41 B: do that one i guess i'm cause 

101.54 102.86 B: they don't want um 

104.03 108.56 B: strange people i don't know but but if i'm asked 

108.85 116.15 B: to to you know to go through that kind of procedure i'm all for it like uh you know cause i don't do anything bad 

116.30 116.79 B: so 

116.36 116.86 A: mhm 

117.25 126.26 B: uh it's going to be good opportunity for me to to prove that i am the right person to work for the company stuff like that 

126.47 127.00 B: so 

127.04 129.14 A: yeah i have the same idea 

130.26 132.32 A: yeah and so you know if 

132.88 134.35 A: someone you (( )) maybe 

134.65 137.51 A: get some strange behavior to you right 

138.05 139.13 A: so weird so 

139.60 141.83 A: i think that's good policy 

142.33 144.76 B: i think so 

144.17 144.48 A: uh 

145.19 145.70 B: um 

145.98 146.46 B: yeah 

146.85 147.34 B: um 

148.46 150.51 B: do we have to continue this conversation 

150.64 151.54 B: uh longer 

151.77 155.29 B: a little bit longer i don't know this is my first time to do this 

152.14 152.91 A: hm 

155.67 157.58 A: yeah me either 

157.15 158.31 B: so so i don't know how 

158.46 161.27 B: to end this but anyway um 

160.79 161.30 A: uh huh 

161.87 165.03 A: maybe you can talk anything you want 

164.06 170.35 B: yeah i guess so anyway um let me see what else um 

171.54 177.28 B: so do you think that those people who refuse uh uh to take the test is 

177.47 183.06 B: uh mainly because they want to protect their privacy or something like that 

183.55 187.41 A: hm yeah i think that's maybe part of the reason 

187.28 188.51 B: yeah i think so 

188.11 195.71 A: yeah not all of the reason right so (( )) refuse you can think of maybe he use the drugs right 

190.26 191.29 B: that's right 

195.97 196.54 B: mhm 

197.49 199.07 A: yeah but 

199.33 200.05 A: maybe 

200.18 200.60 A: not 

201.67 204.27 A: one hundred percent right at least uh 

204.64 206.07 A: seventy percent right 

205.93 207.01 B: that's right yeah 

207.13 207.65 A: uh huh 

207.89 211.41 A: maybe few people really care about their privacy so 

213.00 214.62 B: but i think if mhm 

213.14 214.29 A: but at at least 

215.02 218.04 A: but at least i think th- that's the good policy 

219.49 221.03 A: ah most ah at least 

221.24 223.90 A: in you know not (( )) but 

224.34 225.27 A: alright for me 

227.49 232.73 B: it's kind of strange isn't it if if someone um refuse take the test 

233.24 240.15 B: um the company might think okay maybe you're kind of afraid of the result or something like that you see what i'm saying 

240.43 246.98 B: it's kind of a hard to tell uh whether or not the person doesn't want to take the test because he 

240.45 241.03 A: uh huh 

247.12 255.20 B: he has been or he or she has been on drug or he he's worried about his pri- or his or her privacy you know 

254.87 255.55 A: (( )) 

255.55 257.04 B: the company can't tell 

257.52 258.08 B: uh what 

258.41 258.76 B: the 

258.93 259.92 B: the the motive 

260.36 261.30 B: the person has 

262.01 263.78 A: wh- wh- what do you feel about drugs

306.34 308.90 B: i know that's true maybe they want to 

309.08 312.06 B: escape from reality or something like that i don't know

312.78 314.38 A: yeah but you know after you 

315.82 317.50 A: if you just get you know
