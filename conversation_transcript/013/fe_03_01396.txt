91.79 94.34 A: husband to do some lessons so 

94.42 103.18 A: um we actually wanna start doing lessons and i know that that's a good way to to work out it's you know you're required to go as well as

105.83 107.11 B: oh yeah 

107.01 111.88 A: uh that's what i wanna do i've been to a couple of functions where i've been able to do that but 

112.57 122.42 A: i wanna actually be able to do it a couple of times a week that way you know 'cause a regimen is important you can't just do it one time and expect it to really work so 

121.93 123.66 B: [laughter] yeah 

123.52 124.53 A: (( you know )) 

124.61 126.44 A: (( so i'm trying to )) 

126.48 127.88 A: (( do a um )) 

128.74 136.25 A: a regimen of that and and walking is also good because it gives you chance to clear your head a little bit and and um 

136.31 139.05 A: do the things that you need to do and 

138.43 144.18 B: yeah if the weather gets good i'll probably be working outside i guess that's exercise planting the garden and 

144.23 145.30 A: mhm 

144.70 150.97 B: working on my raspberries gotta trim those down and it won't be long and we'll have to start the mowing the lawn

174.44 175.30 B: (( so )) 

175.55 183.85 A: definitely so you know that's something you know being out in the garden working and exercising like that does something that um 

184.37 187.14 A: kinda will work out your arms a little bit you know 

187.01 188.57 B: yeah yeah 

187.22 189.64 A: if you wanna be able to do something uh 

190.33 195.58 A: you know to work the whole body you know what i mean as well as clearing your mind too 

192.58 193.66 B: yeah 

196.10 199.41 A: so sometimes that's the hardest thing to be able to 

199.30 204.01 B: i do a bicycle too that uh has flat tires so hopefully i'll get those 

203.12 205.04 A: [laughter] 

204.36 207.59 B: taken care of and so i can ride my bike again this summer 

207.30 210.97 A: what you do you can boost it up in the house and make it a stationery bike 

210.64 216.33 B: oh well there is one in the house here but it's not handy so i don't use that very often 

216.37 217.75 A: oh

248.25 249.26 A: mhm 

248.68 253.71 B: i go up and down the road and pick up cans 'cause we've got a five cent deposit here 

253.92 255.34 A: oh okay 

253.97 262.92 B: so it's sort of a double dose thing i get my exercise and then i go down and you know out in the ditches and pick up some cans that are nickels [laughter] 

256.58 257.83 A: yeah 

262.82 265.94 A: wow that's pretty good 

265.61 266.76 B: yeah 

267.24 275.58 A: that's pretty good at least that something that you're still being active with and you know what the more active you are the younger you are [laughter] 

271.49 272.63 B: right 

274.87 279.01 B: well yeah yeah i was actually probably more active

352.37 354.94 A: wow what'd you do track and field 

354.76 361.36 B: yeah i did the shot and the discus which i've never done before see we didn't have track when i was at a school 

358.24 359.89 A: oh my word 

361.19 362.20 A: okay 

361.67 370.25 B: and uh and then i did the hundred and the two hundred and then we had to do the fun run with the with the grandkids so that was another two hundred 

370.94 371.75 A: (( mm ))

374.06 375.32 A: oh okay 

375.24 381.27 B: but there weren't that many participants in my category so i ended up winning [laughter] you know 

380.88 382.70 A: oh that's great 

382.13 387.14 B: so we got we got medals or ribbons or whatever it was and the kid uh 

385.96 387.10 A: mhm 

387.20 392.56 B: ashley she's the one the does track and she did too and she was all excited about that so 

392.77 399.30 B: so we you know we've paid kitreole with the kids and stuff so that sort of keeps you young too 

396.72 398.11 A: (( okay mhm )) 

399.22 402.32 A: oh definitely definitely 

401.71 403.37 B: you have some grandkids 

403.25 406.19 A: no uh-uh i have a fifteen year old 

406.22 407.29 B: oh 

407.00 408.38 A: but um 

408.75 411.50 A: he's very active and uh 

411.26 415.10 B: so you're probably still running around does he participate in sports and stuff 

414.29 418.25 A: yeah he he plays basketball about two or three times a week 

418.69 420.22 A: sometimes more 

420.04 421.03 B: yeah 

420.36 425.39 A: so you know they kinda keep him busy but i was more active than [mn] you know a 

425.79 427.32 A: couple of years ago 

427.43 430.04 A: i had um very serious 

430.07 436.96 A: brain surgery so that kinda hindered my ability to work out the way that i did before 

436.96 437.82 B: (( mm )) 

437.23 444.27 A: so i have to kinda be real careful that's why i say walking is something that i can do on my own pace you know what i mean 

444.02 445.41 B: yes right 

444.63 449.71 A: it's not like doing a an exercise tape or going to 

449.87 452.06 A: you know a little old um 

452.08 458.78 A: aerobic class it's nothing like that so i can kinda do walking on my own pace you know kind of thing 

454.19 455.17 B: uh-huh 

458.58 459.63 B: right 

458.99 465.99 A: so because i have those health issues i have to kinda pace myself and do it whatever way is gonna kind of make me comfortable 

466.16 469.63 A: but you know i know it's important not only to 

469.80 477.77 A: physically exercise but it's important to eat right too because if you don't whether you exercise or not your body'll tell you 

477.94 482.65 B: right right right well i try to exercise once in a while some- 

478.57 479.57 A: (( so yourself )) 

482.74 486.20 B: sometimes too and i'm just sitting around or something you know 

486.15 487.22 A: mhm 

486.55 497.27 B: you will feel but uh not as much as i know i should but once it gets nice out again and i'm outside and then you see me get enough exercise [laughter] 

489.72 491.48 A: (( yeah )) 

496.51 498.26 A: (( you can always skate )) 

497.67 502.13 B: well you see we're also on the farm so we're out in the country and we have 

499.92 501.27 A: (( oh a )) 

502.51 503.44 B: (( you know )) 

503.20 504.76 A: lot of land 

505.06 510.23 B: [laughter] yeah yeah although we do have it rented out because my husband's we're both retired 

509.85 511.13 A: oh okay 

510.24 513.87 B: i this is my first year not teaching for thirty two years so 

513.05 514.75 A: (( wow )) 

515.16 518.23 A: wow that's great that is beautiful 

516.56 517.49 B: so 

518.64 520.54 A: (( ooh so you )) 

519.65 532.72 B: i've gotta i gotta i'm working on some stain glass and that's in the basement so i get my exercise going up and down the steps [laughter] i guess that's not enough but sometimes the phone rings and i'm up and down and up and down 

528.96 530.08 A: [laughter] 

532.22 533.74 A: mhm 

532.98 534.34 B: but uh 

535.56 537.49 B: oh i don't know i i guess 

538.12 543.10 B: and i usually walk fast whenever i walk just about anywhere so i guess that's uh 

541.73 542.68 A: mhm 

543.46 544.88 B: a good thing 

544.58 546.56 A: mhm brisk walking 

546.46 547.94 B: yeah 

546.96 548.69 A: (( because it helps you to have cardio )) 

549.01 550.49 B: (( right right )) 

549.46 554.43 A: mhm and do you eat um a lot of salads and green vegetables 

555.33 556.27 B: (( uh )) 

556.32 559.57 B: not as many probably as i should but [laughter] 

559.73 562.08 A: (( uh-huh 'cause they say like fruits and vegetables )) 

562.55 564.61 A: and like greens and those kinds of things 

563.91 565.52 B: oh yeah yeah 

564.76 568.63 A: are the best diets to have because they help to keep your cholesterol down 

568.51 570.33 B: right yeah 

569.02 569.96 A: um 

570.22 579.09 A: so that even if you don't exercise you know your cholesterol is not high or you don't have to worry about clogged arteries or anything else like that 

578.44 580.41 B: right yeah 

579.51 581.69 A: 'cause i know you know that's important 

581.94 585.72 A: you know especially 'cause we as people nowadays the things that we eat 

585.98 590.83 A: is not always good for us it tastes good but it's not always good for us you know what i mean 

590.97 595.10 A: and we almost end up craving the food that's not good for us 

591.00 592.88 B: right right 

595.33 599.89 A: so we have to make sure that you know let's just say that an apple a day
