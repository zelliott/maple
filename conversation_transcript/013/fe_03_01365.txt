0.18 2.57 B: hello hi i'm betty 

0.43 1.51 A: hello 

2.66 3.99 A: (( hi i'm angelique )) 

3.97 6.58 B: i'm calling from d. c. where are you calling from 

6.79 8.35 A: um from new jersey 

7.99 12.27 B: oh okay [laughter] [laughter] listening to the topic um w- 

9.32 10.22 A: [laughter] 

12.73 21.15 B: we're retired military and it's like my children as they grew up they were always in private schools and there was censorship 

21.78 25.44 B: but now that i've got a child in public school 

26.08 36.30 B: i i really think we should continue the censorship because right now public schools are just getting everything thrown in at 'em and it's it's it's not good material what do you think 

36.96 50.59 A: um well i think that there's a big difference um between public and private schools mainly that you know private schools are not able to be regulated by the government because their you know the funding comes from themselves and [mn] 

50.02 50.98 B: correct 

50.66 56.93 A: and the families whereas you know the public schools are funded by the government and therefore um you know 

56.06 58.63 B: but but they're our tax dollars a- 

57.07 58.15 A: they have to 

58.85 69.03 B: and so it's still in a way private donations because these are our tax dollars these are our tax dollars that are funding these schools though so to me it's still like a private donation 

59.37 60.07 A: (( don't )) 

62.08 62.98 A: you think 

69.70 74.19 B: so i think we should have better control over both sectors private and public schools [mn] 

74.43 76.01 A: well no i mean 

76.07 84.59 A: like the the schools are in state jurisdiction so i think it's really up to the state but they still i mean and the state has to um you know of course pay 

84.55 94.08 A: respects to the to the larger federal government and you know i think that um when the when an outside force is regulating a school then um 

94.11 97.53 A: [lipsmack] we kinda have to play by their rules and you know 

97.89 108.96 A: we we're guaranteed the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press by the first amendment and because of that you know i really i think that cutting the censorship in public schools would kind of go against the competition 

109.73 116.34 B: but we we should all it it should be an equal basis because that's the only way we're going to make an equal educational system 

116.91 127.48 B: um because in private schools you're requiring more um of the teachers more certification better training and we have had so many teachers in 

127.72 130.21 B: public schools that aren't even certified 

130.61 132.44 A: [lipsmack] that are not certified 

130.62 131.68 B: so may- 

132.00 133.89 B: that are not certified teaching 

134.06 135.87 B: especially in this area 

134.29 135.27 A: (( i )) 

136.23 139.28 A: i yeah i i don't really know about that i mean um 

139.05 153.69 A: my grandmother was a teacher in a public high school for many years and i mean i've i've never heard of um a school of public schools you know not hiring certified teachers but i mean if that's a problem then i think that certainly you know teachers should be certified 

153.22 156.11 B: they've got um people coming in from other um 

156.65 162.67 B: um degreed areas and they're letting them teach while they work on their certification things like that 

162.65 174.49 B: in in a private school it's mandatory because you're trying to give that child the best possible education there is and censorship does help on that because [sigh] 

162.89 163.77 A: oh 

174.96 177.84 B: a lot of facts in our literature 

178.34 179.92 B: you know isn't complete 

180.38 184.81 B: we went through uh the monument today in d. c. and read a lot of the um 

180.45 181.84 A: mhm 

185.19 186.10 B: um 

186.62 195.12 B: the speeches from the presidents and um we looked at martin luther king's um march we looked at uh i i mean just 

195.36 202.40 B: tons of history things i didn't even know existed and private schools do teach that 

198.93 199.64 A: (( did you )) 

202.43 207.44 B: public schools uh they lack so much so censorship is good 

207.55 212.87 B: because it's gonna get the the basic knowledge that you need out there first 

212.80 226.60 A: well i certainly agree that you know the basics should be taught in every school and i mean i think that should definitely be part of every school's curriculum um and i i mean i grew up in a in a public school and um you know i think that i was given a very good education 

226.27 227.18 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

226.59 228.04 A: and um 

228.18 239.85 A: [lipsmack] i think that i i don't think you could say one way or another that you know public schools do not teach this or do teach this i think that you know varies slightly but um in terms of in terms of censorship of you know specific books 

239.91 250.23 A: in public schools um i just think that it's it's a very delicate situation i mean it's going lead to a very slippery slope and if you say well if um some pupils parents say well this one book 

250.11 258.87 A: you know it goes against our our ethics we we don't like it you know we don't think it should be taught you know we don't want our children reading this then who's to say that something else that you know 

254.43 255.29 B: (( uh huh )) 

255.79 256.54 B: (( uh huh )) 

259.08 264.45 A: that may not be so controversial might get banned and you know who who knows where it's gonna stop and soon 

264.25 279.15 A: you know we'll end up in situation like nineteen eighty four you know where um where there's just you know there's total control of everything and you just don't have access to anything you wanna read not that that would happen but it's something that could potentially happen and if you if you just start banning books 

274.63 275.37 B: (( uh huh )) 

279.35 284.13 A: um just you know on the basis of that they go against what you believe is correct 

283.76 291.77 B: i guess being military we've um for twenty t- twenty seven years everything's been censored for us so it doesn't bother us as much um 

291.90 305.08 B: like with the war that's going on right now i think we're putting too much on television we're telling too many facts you know get the basics out there and leave the rest of it alone you know a a child has to have a basic primary education 

305.30 311.52 B: and that's what censorship does that's what i've seen so far with with my younger children going to school 

311.97 315.91 A: well you mean by censorship giving a better education you're just saying that um 

316.24 323.57 A: if if you were choosing between something like uh i don't know of mice and men versus the history of the united states 

323.92 326.69 A: um you would choose the history of the united states right 

326.22 328.09 B: correct i would 

327.17 329.52 A: well i i don't really think that there should be 

329.54 342.40 A: that there doesn't really have to be a choice i mean i think that you can allow both in the curriculum i think what the question is saying though is that um if there is a book you know say say of mice and men which was a banned book um 

342.68 345.10 A: and you know i have some 

343.86 345.22 B: but there was reas- 

345.23 346.98 B: there was a reason for banning 

347.18 348.32 B: that book 

348.31 349.30 A: right 

348.69 350.34 B: it it's [sigh] 

350.83 352.17 A: i'm sorry what did you say 

352.00 355.00 B: [mn] it's kind of hard to explain i'm a black american 

354.95 355.81 A: mhm 

355.55 358.97 B: and it just went against so many beliefs that we had 

359.17 362.97 B: it really did um it brought too much controversy 

360.77 361.64 A: right 

363.11 364.58 B: into the system 

364.68 366.06 B: those types of books 

364.91 371.19 A: right but sometimes controversy is good i mean a lot of times if you know if everybody's secure in their thinking and um 

371.12 379.62 A: you know nothing ever challenges their belief systems then there will be no change and i mean you might think that change is not good but i mean especially being a black american 

373.70 374.27 B: (( [mn] )) 

379.49 380.87 A: what if you know 

380.69 394.65 A: like say the american south say um you know we banned huckleberry finn so there'd be a lot less literature saying that you know black people should be given their rights would you be in favor of you know keeping the status quo and not you know introducing any change sometimes change is good 

394.14 398.34 B: well correct sometimes change is good but it's got to be gradually brought in 

394.46 396.36 A: sometimes change is necessary 

398.98 408.40 A: right right i agree but i just think that um controversy is something that that's needed otherwise we're going to settle into our narrow way of thinking and that that'll just breed ignorance 

408.18 415.91 B: but in school too much controversy is disruptive i think we don't have enough control in the schools as it is now 

412.09 413.52 A: but it 

415.73 424.34 A: but it's kind of hard to determine how much is too much controversy you know what i'm saying like who who is to determine i think it's just a it's a value judgment you know 

424.43 428.53 B: well that's what the private schools do they determine it and it 

424.62 425.49 A: um 

427.86 438.04 A: right exactly i think that private schools are well within their jurisdiction of doing that but for public schools um i really i i'm just not so sure how that could be regulated you know across the nation 

437.62 444.26 B: in d. c. um they've got this program where you can choose to let your child go to public or private school 

444.30 450.48 B: and th- it could be funded by the government and a lot of people are choosing the private sector because of that because they feel that 

450.53 451.53 B: um 

451.73 453.32 B: the children are are 

453.52 459.47 B: getting vast more information from the private sec- um private sector 

459.31 460.42 A: mhm 

459.44 471.09 B: also did you hear a news um interview about six days ago a congressman came on television and said he would rather drop twelfth grade and in- introduce pre k. 

471.74 473.12 B: into the system 

473.80 478.14 B: saying that's where we're gonna learn the most information when the child is a the 

478.24 481.74 B: at the you know the very tip of life learning 

481.88 483.83 B: why should we drop something 

484.25 485.39 A: right 

484.38 489.65 B: we've got children i mean just passing on in life they can't read 

489.73 490.73 A: mhm 

489.96 491.99 B: our public schools have given up 

492.04 493.66 B: that uh censorship 

494.10 496.85 B: challenges a child it really does 

496.82 497.80 A: mhm 

497.53 500.91 B: i really do i think it makes a child think 

501.14 502.67 B: and be motivated 

502.74 504.90 B: and encouraged to wanna learn 

505.93 508.76 A: [lipsmack] um you sorta you think censorship does this 

509.20 510.78 B: repeat that i'm sorry 

510.75 515.30 A: uh i'm so- uh my phone is i don't have a very good connection what did you say um 

515.20 525.21 B: i think the pub- um the private schools with their censorship the materials that they're introducing to the children it encourages the child to think more 

515.45 516.22 A: you should 

525.22 529.63 B: be more independent and more active in their community 

529.71 536.35 A: discuss [lipsmack] well i mean i i don't think you can you know um necessarily exte- extend that ex- 

536.27 545.82 A: sorry extend that to um to the rest of the nation you know saying that all private schools are better in the curriculum than public schools because i know at least in my home town 

544.23 545.64 B: well correct 

545.76 554.23 A: um our public school is actually it produces more you know leaders in the community than does our private school which is 

553.06 557.56 B: are those the schools um schools for the arts are you talking about those type schools 

557.12 570.38 A: no no i'm just talking about our regular public school i mean i grew up in new jersey and i grew up in a very small suburban town and we have a public school and we also have a private school within our town and you know the private school is smaller um [lipsmack] 

562.58 563.52 B: (( uh huh )) 

566.76 567.61 B: okay 

570.38 576.40 A: you know it's it's a whole different curriculum and the statistics show that you know more kids 

576.41 584.47 A: you know a higher percent like the the ratio of kids who go on to college is higher in a public school than it is in the private school i don't think you can 

582.84 587.97 B: well no no back up on that one you've got to also realize there's more children in 

588.19 590.47 B: public schools than private schools 

588.46 592.41 A: yeah but that's why i said exactly but that's why i said the ratio of students 

591.58 594.15 B: oh okay okay i didn't hear that part i'm sorry okay 

594.09 599.89 A: right so i so that's why i'm just saying that you can't necessarily say that oh private schools are better than public schools
