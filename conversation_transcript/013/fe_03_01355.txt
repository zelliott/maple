0.00 1.92 B: and i think that's just horrible i mean 

0.00 1.05 A: hello 

1.56 2.54 A: hi 

3.54 7.89 B: well i went to a private school myself for thirteen years and i thought that you know 

3.78 5.11 A: i'm michelle 

8.28 14.57 B: the the sheltering is at some point is is is a good thing i mean at that age they don't need to know 

14.76 28.53 B: what they what they tell them i mean [laughter] there's so much information out there and some of that has the right it should be a parent's right to do that and to tell them that and there's a limited amount of information that they really need at that age 

17.70 21.85 A: (( mhm )) 

26.34 30.55 A: yeah my daughter is in public public middle school and 

31.15 33.45 A: it's pretty much anything goes 

34.71 37.46 A: i'd rather it didn't go but [laughter] 

37.05 40.18 B: and i think that's not some place it belongs at school i mean 

40.19 45.25 B: yeah they need to know about the birds and the bees but that's something that should be told at home 

49.59 50.67 B: i mean 

50.62 51.65 A: [laughter] 

52.78 64.29 B: when i think that there's a lot of it that it's it's you know you have your own way you want to tell it and you know whether would depending on your religious background what you feel that they need to know and the more that they know the more 

57.91 60.02 A: yeah they don't they don't 

61.99 66.87 A: like for instance they don't they don't censor the the sex education 

64.46 68.01 B: i think that it opens up doors that you really don't want open 

67.42 70.22 A: i censored it i opted her out of it i said no 

68.55 75.90 B: you know i mean they appear the stuff and they think this is all good you know and that's the last thing on the earth that you want for a child you know 

70.57 71.37 A: when 

73.60 74.49 A: that's 

75.99 79.85 B: you know they gi- i mean look at the even in the past history look at the sexual 

78.38 83.07 A: that's what i told them i said when i want her to know about that i will let her know 

80.40 83.79 B: changes that have happened in the last fifteen years i mean 

83.27 86.42 A: you know [laughter] and i did let her know but in my way 

83.91 89.94 B: kids are having babies that are fourteen twelve years old you know that's obscene there's no reason for that 

90.30 95.16 B: i don't know i just think it's horrible i think that that's part of the reason that we you know 

95.28 103.58 B: don't have our child in the public school you know i think that that's they have the right to do that and i know at the catholic school that we have my son at it's not 

101.62 103.13 A: yeah yeah 

103.66 106.81 B: that they're very careful what they tell them you know 

106.76 108.41 A: [laughter] 

110.91 111.94 B: i agree 

122.85 124.74 A: mhm 

125.34 126.39 B: mhm 

131.27 132.34 A: yeah 

133.07 141.16 B: what you know what is wrong with having morals i mean what's wrong with teaching that as part of the curriculum i mean whatever happened to i don't know abstinence 

140.50 144.91 A: that's i think that's the way it should be even even in public schools [laughter] 

141.45 142.92 B: i mean you know 

143.53 152.05 B: no that's something that they don't teach and i think that that's bad because you know if they are going to do the deal they should do the whole deal and not just do 

145.14 146.82 A: i mean they don't need 

147.31 150.50 A: they start they start that off in the the fifth grade 

151.30 156.10 A: and i was shocked because i said well i need i want to see the curriculum 

152.05 159.87 B: the small chunk that looks fun you know the one with the responsibility and everything else that goes with all those things that you're telling 'em you know how to do 

156.24 158.99 A: you know before i give you my yes or no 

159.40 161.38 A: i looked it over and it's like 

161.60 166.61 A: there's no morals it's just well this is what you do and this is how you do it 

165.91 171.73 B: yeah i think that's i think that's hard and you know i wish that you know even in this area that the public schools would do that but they're very 

172.01 185.33 B: i won't say blatant but bold about it you know but they are very forthcoming and it's like you don't they don't want the parents to know you know any they want us to know as very little as possible so they don't make a big issue out of it well it is a big issue 

174.97 178.01 A: they definitely don't teach that 

187.48 188.15 B: [laughter] 

188.05 189.14 A: [laughter] 

193.69 198.26 A: yeah they teach them how to but not how to say no they don't want to 

196.67 208.20 B: yeah and i think that's that's horrible i mean you should have a right to walk into a classroom and to find out what's being taught and without having to you know give three days advance notice is what they want up here at the prep public school here 

208.64 221.94 B: before you actually get into to see you know your own student which to me is a bunch of garbage you know i want to know walk in and find out what they're teaching and i don't want to be announced so everything can be changed i want to be able to have the right to do that 

218.67 230.20 A: yeah they don't like me at my daughter's school [laughter] because i'm nosy and i want to find out what they're teaching her and they just kind of wish i'd fade into the woodwork and let them get on with what they want to do 

221.99 223.12 B: and you know 

237.64 238.69 B: mhm 

250.99 260.19 B: [noise] well i think that's that's fruitful i mean if more people knew that they would do that and if they would do it then a lot of the stuff would be shocked by what their kids are being taught 

255.71 259.11 A: i've seen that's what i do i show up and i say i need to 

259.16 263.65 A: i need to go and ovserv- observe in the classroom and 

263.72 266.60 A: by by california law they have to let you 

264.96 266.08 B: exactly 

267.64 268.72 B: i think that that's 

267.70 271.25 A: and they don't like the fact that i know that they have to let me 

268.88 274.50 B: hard and you know and it's hard as a parent to you know it's like they're sneak the stuff by us 

271.95 273.69 A: but but um 

274.61 277.67 B: you know and i think that's horrible and that's again why 

274.68 279.99 A: they have to they have to let you without any advance notice according to the law and so 

277.78 281.49 B: you know we're sending part of the resource to a private school 

280.09 284.14 A: a lot of parents don't know that a lot of parents think they have to call and make an appointment 

281.85 286.74 B: they're very structured in what they tell the children and they think that this kind of stuff should be taught at home 

286.71 288.16 A: and they don't like 

286.95 296.82 B: um and yeah they grease over parts of it when they get older but they don't go in depth and and hand out condoms and things like that because they don't believe in it and they believe it's wrong 

294.01 298.35 A: they are not you know if they are not doing anything wrong what's the what would be the problem 

297.11 300.88 B: you know and that's what i believe you know that's not something that 

301.22 307.39 B: you know an eighth grader or ninth grader needs to know or care about you know they should be worrying about other things 

301.68 302.38 A: (( mhm )) 

319.96 321.15 A: mhm 

322.84 333.69 B: well exactly you know but they're forcing children to grow up early by teaching them this kind of stuff and by putting it out there putting it out on the table you know they wouldn't know about it and they wouldn't care 

330.38 331.30 A: mhm 

333.56 343.28 B: but it's bringing attention to it so it's it's drawing the kids into it and i think that that that's bad and that's where part of our problem is coming from because the society is just going to pot because 

340.66 346.46 A: yeah yeah i'm lucky in that regard no my daughter's not 

343.66 347.65 B: they teach 'em what they want but they don't teach 'em the morals and the responsibilities that go with it 

347.03 352.93 A: like the other you know most of the girls are oh i have a boyfriend and things like 

353.00 356.51 A: i mean i didn't even think about until i was maybe in high school 

360.22 365.91 B: well there's nothing wrong with that i mean unfortunately all that stuff comes quick enough but you don't need to force it 

366.83 369.56 B: yep i agree my son was only 

369.60 372.55 B: he's going to be six in june and that's you know 

370.98 371.88 A: mhm 

372.91 376.55 B: it's good that they are naive that's what children are supposed to be 

376.69 377.63 B: you know 

377.64 386.11 B: [cough] and unfortunately they're forced to grow up so quickly now with everything you know and it's like that is like that should be the last thing on their mind at you know 

382.94 385.01 A: (( yeah )) 

385.03 391.14 A: so i mean i'm lucky that way because she's not she's i guess i guess she'd be considered immature 

386.35 388.10 B: at that young age you know 

391.89 394.03 A: but i prefer it that way [laughter] 

397.64 400.79 A: yeah i mean she's still a child let her be that way 

404.27 405.16 B: mhm 

409.82 410.97 A: yeah 

412.34 413.51 B: yeah 

417.55 422.82 B: i mean you know you have to do what you have to do to keep control because you know the school's obviously not going to give it to you 

421.58 425.97 A: yeah i'm looking i'm actually looking into home schooling because it's just gotten 

422.96 423.90 B: you know 

424.19 426.14 B: and you know 

426.34 428.88 A: as they've moved up in grades 

426.43 434.06 B: it's it's not you know the majority of people would be shocked to find out what their children are being taught and if they knew and they got involved and they knew 

429.21 430.79 A: worse every year 

431.86 438.01 A: and private school is not an option for us because we're a you know a single income family so 

434.03 442.93 B: they'd be screaming to high heaven you know but it's the those few people that push the stuff through you know that actually get involved and stuff 

438.41 443.10 A: i'm going to look into i'm looking into home schooling for them i think that would be 

443.09 448.33 B: and they're the lunatics that thinks that this is a great thing you know 

443.17 446.04 A: at least then i know i can control everythi- you know 

446.57 450.19 A: what they what they do and don't read and learn 

448.32 460.90 B: because they don't want to have to deal with it at home they think that if they can push it up on the school the school will do it then oh yeah then they're good you know then they're off the hook they don't have to worry about it well those are the kids that are running the streets you know 

461.10 465.53 B: [laughter] it's like it's just horrible because you know even when i was growing up 

466.09 472.83 B: there wasn't kids going out and getting pregnant at that age i mean it was almost unheard of you know now it's an every day occurrence 

470.34 471.31 A: mhm 

478.45 485.24 B: and i think it's a good idea that's the thing that hurts it's painful to hear is that these young girls think that this was a good idea 

485.30 492.18 B: an- and these boys think that this is a big joke that they've got you know so many kids i mean where's the responsibility part 

488.34 489.50 A: mhm yeah 

506.27 509.01 A: yeah yeah they're younger and younger 

507.80 509.37 B: no that's messed up 

509.22 512.06 A: hearing 'em hearing about it 

510.98 512.92 B: mhm a fad 

513.18 517.03 B: because that child's life is going to be messed up for a very long time you know 

518.57 520.59 A: oh yeah life's i mean 

524.04 528.70 B: well how are you going to feed it and how are you going clothe it and how are you going to you know i mean just everything 

525.73 531.21 A: i had a niece that was invited to a baby shower of a fourteen year old 

529.22 531.27 B: the they're children are 

531.34 536.20 A: and the fourteen year old thought nothing you know oh this is great she is happy 

532.56 533.46 B: (( yeah )) 

533.66 536.19 B: well there's so much work and you know it's like 

536.37 547.93 B: you you need to give 'em what they have a right to you have a right to love and attention and time and all the stuff and at fourteen you don't even have enough comfortable in your own nor much less take care of an infant 

537.33 539.44 A: and i'm going no 

539.83 541.42 A: you shouldn't be happy 

543.01 544.68 A: you should be in shock 

549.71 552.04 A: mm yeah 

552.42 558.21 A: you should be thinking should i give this baby up for adoption because there's no way a fourteen year old can do it 

561.05 563.64 B: yeah that's the last thing you want to do is condone that 

562.88 567.14 A: it's ha- it's hard enough when you're an adult and you do it 

582.35 583.41 A: no no 

584.65 586.01 B: set the table george 

585.39 590.65 A: so i told my sister you better not be letting her go to that baby shower that's just you know giving her 

591.73 593.81 A: teaching her to think oh it's okay 

596.79 599.95 A: mm so like i'm the oldest of
