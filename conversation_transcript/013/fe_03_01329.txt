55.82 60.89 B: okay so they're saying that it's five fifteen now and what do we think about 

61.14 66.04 B: what is the question cause i was i was over (( )) about this pen number 

61.17 62.49 A: or no i thought it 

66.20 68.55 B: what's the question 

68.10 72.34 A: how do we feel about an increasing to five fifteen so i i wonder what it is 

72.51 73.26 B: oh my 

72.75 73.19 A: now 

73.72 74.70 B: how do we eh 

73.85 75.94 A: but regardless i don't think that's enough 

74.81 78.92 B: feel about increasing oh to five fifteen you mean it's lower than that now 

79.79 83.27 B: how do we feel about it increasing to five fifteen is that the question 

80.09 80.41 A: i 

83.46 83.74 A: yep 

83.87 86.64 B: okay well i'm all for it 

86.41 92.02 A: i think they should it increase more cause nobody can make a living on it now and unfortunately there's too many uneducated people out there 

87.72 88.51 B: yeah 

92.06 93.09 B: yeah i cannot 

92.65 93.13 A: then a 

93.39 93.84 B: yeah 

94.49 97.07 B: i cannot imagine anybody trying to work 

97.24 105.68 B: uh an hour for five fifteen and then whatever you can possibly buy for fi- to work all hours for five fifteen 

105.42 107.56 A: never mind after you pay day care and everything else 

107.48 108.16 B: yeah 

108.31 109.13 B: yeah 

108.40 111.37 A: i mean that that doesn't even cower cover the hourly rate of 

111.54 113.57 A: day care so i guess i'm in full support of it 

113.71 114.69 B: yeah yea- 

114.25 114.65 A: um 

115.51 125.42 B: yeah i am too i'd that's it i'd i i really that's it i don't know what it is i would've guessed it higher higher than that so i definitely believe it should be at least that or more 

125.28 130.51 A: i thought it was five twenty five an hour and my friend sitting across the table just said she thought it was five seventy five an hour 

125.61 125.88 B: (( )) 

130.58 136.53 B: well we'll have to we'll have to do a little research and find out what it is but 

131.66 132.06 A: so 

136.50 137.42 A: yeah 

137.33 149.22 B: yeah i just think with the cost of living nowadays that i just i just can't imagine it being that low and then i suppose you can get in not that i know anything about this but you know you have 

137.73 138.00 A: (( )) 

150.80 153.34 B: people get paid like um 

153.51 156.71 B: that don't work like people on uh welfare and things 

157.14 158.07 A: yeah well 

157.21 158.68 B: like how much do they get paid 

158.95 162.62 A: don't even get me started on the welfare system cause i i find that 

160.57 161.01 B: yeah 

162.88 167.12 A: they make it so hard for people to get off cause the lose everything if they make even a penny of money 

166.88 170.72 B: yeah and see that's it i mean if it's this is only going to be that much 

171.19 173.85 B: i mean how much do they get paid and then 

174.34 175.76 B: and then that might 

176.02 185.90 B: not look very good to them so therefore why bother you know that's it so i think it you know even in that respect it needs to be higher too 

180.45 181.06 A: mhm 

186.21 186.73 B: so 

186.41 186.77 A: (( )) 

187.25 189.67 A: just out of curiosity where do you live

290.09 290.49 B: yeah 

291.10 295.74 A: will make it but they should- shouldn't put it onto a national standard it should be by location 

295.91 297.71 B: yes yes mhm 

297.36 299.35 A: or they should make cost of living standards 

299.64 300.08 B: yeah 

300.66 303.27 B: yeah i'm sure that there's other things to be considered 

301.16 301.56 A: so 

304.05 304.61 B: yeah 

304.35 304.69 A: yeah 

305.02 312.97 B: but i yeah i'm i'm definite i know that your area you know is way is a lot more expensive than ours we're very rural here and

375.55 376.04 B: uh-huh 

376.33 386.54 A: it's it's fine cause you can do it on your own hours but uh a regular nine to five job at five fifteen an hour well let's face it you're making forty five dollars a day after taxes it's twenty five and 

386.99 390.59 A: five days a week so you're taking home between a hundred and a hundred and fifty dollars a week 

390.56 392.74 B: mhm mhm (( )) 

393.16 397.76 A: i mean for a college student or a high school student not even a college student but a high school student that's fine 

397.77 398.18 B: yeah 

398.19 403.36 A: even that's cutting it tight cause most times they have bills they have to pay such as car insurance and everything like that

404.00 404.77 B: yeah yeah 

404.90 405.84 A: (( ))

501.37 503.02 A: uh-huh 

501.98 511.75 B: you know but um no i i forget you do get so many thousand dollars at the end of the year for being a resident there but the cost of living is very high in alaska

512.51 515.88 B: uh yeah th- it is but um 

522.01 523.92 B: groceries are a little bit better and 

526.76 529.76 B: you know in the military it's very feasible to live there 

530.18 534.13 B: but uh well i don't know groceries are very high in alaska but

540.92 541.34 B: yes 

541.50 548.73 B: mhm when you're in the military and that's not so bad but i mean i'm just thinking if you just were a resident in a alaska 

542.27 542.57 A: mhm 

547.77 548.27 A: mhm 

549.00 551.16 B: it's just such a different life style i just 

551.70 554.19 B: that's it there's not a lot uh 

554.72 556.57 B: that they do i i guess 

556.75 567.43 B: it's just it's just so basic and common and it's it's a pretty neat we've i've been up twice and and i've i really enjoyed it i (( )) it's gorgeous
