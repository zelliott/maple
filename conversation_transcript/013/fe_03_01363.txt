0.00 1.82 B: hi my name is sue 

1.74 3.58 A: hi i'm ann 

4.00 4.97 B: hi ann 

4.68 6.21 A: hi how are ya 

5.60 7.25 B: good how you doing this evening 

6.48 8.07 A: good good thank you 

8.56 11.70 A: thank you i just got off the phone about an hour ago doing this one 

11.46 13.89 B: so did i i don't know what's going on 

13.40 15.50 A: oh interesting oh 

14.69 19.99 B: they said three calls but i thought it was three wednesday's apart but maybe i'm wrong 

19.67 23.10 A: [laughter] well you got one more to go then yet ay 

24.13 29.77 A: [lipsmack] yes so you probably discussed this with somebody else as well so you've got some 

29.53 35.16 B: yeah i um myself feel that censorship is very dangerous 

35.17 40.03 B: because um there have been a lot of books that are classics that have been censored 

40.18 43.54 B: and for whatever reason because 

44.07 55.91 B: people in a certain area or um parents were alarmed like the harry potter books uh i don't think there is anything wrong with them and it gets children to read which is a great thing 

56.10 63.31 B: and you discover a whole new world from reading and it doesn't mean that a child's gonna become a witch 

56.15 57.09 A: right 

59.60 60.27 A: you 

63.20 63.93 A: (( no [laughter] )) 

63.67 74.07 B: because they read a book about harry potter it's fantasy just like the wizard of oz and bewitched and all kind of things um i'm trying to think 

67.56 68.50 A: (( yes )) 

69.45 70.69 A: yeah like 

72.23 74.67 A: yeah let your imagination go 

74.26 76.67 B: right nancy drew books 

74.92 75.98 A: yeah 

76.84 77.76 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] y- )) 

76.87 84.27 B: um you know there's plenty of books that are great and that doesn't mean that a child is going to be influenced 

84.73 98.13 B: if they read about murder to go out and murder someone i think a worse the worse thing is the violence on t._v. and [lipsmack] and such i mean kids can learn a lot from reading about whole different worlds other cultures 

98.08 103.30 A: oh i agree i agree totally yeah like a- and how are they going to find out if they don't read 

103.49 104.64 B: right 

104.01 114.32 A: you know like if it they're listening to a parent or or um [lipsmack] or whatever even a teacher uh who isn't supposed to be biased but usually there is some bias in in 

114.72 120.21 A: whereas a book they've got the option to read different books and and get a true picture 

120.99 125.04 A: so no i totally agree that uh it should not be censored but 

125.26 126.72 A: it happens 

126.28 135.60 B: oh i know and it's interesting the last person i spoke to was a gentleman and he um was for censorship 

135.70 141.67 B: and he said that he actually brought up the thing with anarchists 

141.66 149.05 B: he m- mentioned like um i don't know jerry ruben a- eldridge cleaver he said he was a child of the sixties 

149.05 160.10 B: and he actually went out and bought these books and he said my parents didn't like it but they allowed me to it [laughter] so i'm like why would you be against it but then the phone went dead and 

156.12 157.34 A: yeah yeah 

160.12 165.10 B: so i didn't get to h- hear his answer i'm like they let him discover for himself 

160.25 161.13 A: (( oh )) 

165.42 166.37 B: that 

166.64 170.43 B: you know of what these people's thoughts and opinions were 

170.47 174.01 B: and he changed and i guess 

174.13 183.52 B: he learned what they thought and that didn't mean that he became an anarchist trying to overthrow the government or whatever but he said that um 

181.49 182.15 A: (( mm )) 

183.52 194.18 B: he you know in my hippy days he said it was it was interesting but i didn't get to ask him why he felt that it was okay that his parents didn't 

192.92 193.85 A: (( oh )) 

194.22 197.77 B: uh stop it and now he's totally against it 

194.29 195.62 A: [sigh] yet he 

197.39 206.36 A: interesting yeah it must it must have um [lipsmack] yeah been interesting to find out what his answer might have been but yeah it it seems to be um 

206.67 215.46 A: like in the sixties or whatever the seventies whatever they there was less less worry about this kinda stuff and it seems to be um 

215.96 219.70 A: more so now which i'm not sure why that is that it uh 

221.08 228.15 A: they say there was as much crime and goings on then as there is now but i guess it wasn't so sophisticated i'm not sure 

229.05 242.56 B: i i don't i just don't understand why people would ban books i mean i could see if something is totally pornographic that it would be harmful to a child that of course i could see banning that 

242.44 244.83 A: [sigh] yes yes 

243.93 254.42 B: but i wouldn't wanna see um a young child exposed to pornography but then on the other hand all they have to do is turn on their television sets m._t._v. and they get 

254.74 256.33 B: a lot of uh hm 

254.83 267.44 A: yeah yeah [lipsmack] no it's true it's true like the last call that i was on too she asked me how uh w- what i thought about you know the books on how to build bombs and and all this stuff right so 

267.82 269.18 A: i mean it i- 

269.33 276.07 A: it was a tough question because you know like they should be banned from certain people but how do you who makes that call 

276.88 284.67 A: you know and and and i mean if somebody's if if there is a will there's a way people will get the information whether the book's banned or not 

284.34 287.11 B: uh yeah i yeah i totally agree i mean 

286.23 288.62 A: if they're so inclined right 

287.59 289.57 B: right i mean i don't think 

290.02 293.16 B: i'm sure it's available out there but i wouldn't 

293.43 296.03 B: myself even go to the trouble to 

295.88 297.09 A: no because 

296.06 298.05 B: locate something like that 

297.22 304.93 A: no no but [lipsmack] no and and i know i i'm i know you're from the southern states i can tell by your accent 

304.53 306.61 B: oh actually i'm from philadelphia 

305.99 307.33 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

306.71 308.25 B: born and raised 

307.56 310.16 A: (( are you oh no i can hear an accent )) 

308.36 309.14 B: you're 

309.36 312.06 B: you're the not the first person that's said that 

311.49 313.74 A: oh well yeah 'cause [lipsmack] 

312.40 319.06 B: i've gotten that um at my place of work [laughter] that's interesting are you from philly too 

316.04 318.04 A: (( [laughter] )) 

318.98 321.36 A: no i'm from canada from vancouver near 

321.16 322.64 B: oh okay 

321.66 323.24 A: b. c. so 

323.36 334.48 A: yeah and i just was gonna say like uh one of our school districts here has uh there's been a big going on and on battle with uh banning um [lipsmack] books on homosexuality 

334.53 339.00 A: you know like like the lesbian the books i guess some parents have uh 

339.35 346.59 A: obviously there is parents out there there's children out there that are but um they've th- for whatever reasons the school board has thought that 

346.75 351.35 A: that the children shouldn't be allowed to read these books right [lipsmack] 

351.03 353.93 B: is it grade school or high school or mm 

353.04 357.10 A: grade school elementary yeah the lower grades 

356.28 361.36 B: and uh does it talk about actual uh i mean se- sexual things 

360.41 369.98 A: no no it's just like like it's like a like a a grade three four little reader you know like it's and it's i've got two moms or i've got two dads and 

369.09 370.57 B: oh and 

370.00 372.30 A: this kind of thing and and it's um 

372.93 376.58 A: it's a it's quite a bit of controversy here because because 

376.69 384.25 A: some people like when either you really believe o- or you really believe whichever way right like and it's and it's getting the school board is um 

381.45 382.69 B: right 

384.75 390.42 A: and then it becomes political right like like the way to get voted in again and all this stuff so 

387.03 388.26 B: oh yeah 

390.88 396.24 B: yeah whenever politics gets into it it's just crooked around here anyway 

393.53 395.71 A: yeah like it's yeah 

395.85 398.62 A: yeah yeah i'm sure it's all over but 

399.21 410.49 A: but uh it it's it's hard to you sit and listen right and just 'cause it doesn't doesn't affect you personally doesn't i mean at the moment it doesn't affect you personally [laughter] right like like uh 

408.17 409.33 B: right 

410.74 415.08 A: but but it it's it's interesting how um 

415.37 420.04 A: somebody gets their mind set on something and it just they go with it and and uh 

420.66 421.92 A: sometimes they win 

422.36 423.80 B: mhm 

423.16 429.11 A: because these books have been banned which i think how are the kids gonna find out if it if if if uh 

429.63 433.43 A: there's biased parents that want it banned then 

433.57 436.75 A: then they're gonna give th- their children a biased opinion 

437.31 440.35 A: and and the kids will never know the truth 

439.55 443.99 B: they're they're bringing their children up in such a narrow world 

443.40 446.23 A: i belie- yeah yes it's a 

445.38 447.94 B: and everything's not one way 

447.81 448.67 A: no 

448.25 451.65 B: there is two sides to every situation and 

449.43 450.80 A: to everything 

450.97 452.89 A: (( yes yeah [lipsmack] )) 

451.66 453.71 B: it just uh reading 

453.82 458.29 B: i think expands your mind and it just teaches you so much 

458.31 465.44 B: i don't know if you've um ever participated in any book clubs but it's really interesting how 

458.40 459.23 A: oh 

465.83 475.94 B: you know uh h- i don't know five ten people in a book group can read one book and everyone comes together and and has a different opinion on it 

475.31 485.33 A: yes i i haven't belonged but i've uh i've seen well there's there's the odd movie or whatever where there's been a book club and i've seen that happen and i didn't i didn't know it happened in real life 

485.30 487.79 B: it really it really does um 

487.23 487.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

488.36 493.91 B: i mean everyone gets something out of it and it's just it's interesting how everyone gets something different 

493.73 494.61 A: oh 

493.95 496.06 B: and how they can just 

496.07 497.26 B: say that 

498.24 500.64 B: you know ban it completely 

500.73 501.57 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

500.85 504.87 B: unless it's pornographic material uh for a young child 

504.89 511.53 B: i just feel that how can they there's been so many classics that they've tried to ban and 

511.40 512.28 A: yeah 

511.72 515.61 B: or political books that they've tried to ban and i- it's just 

515.80 520.51 A: and they just turn out to yeah yeah it's yeah it doesn't happen 

515.94 517.36 B: it's insane 

521.01 525.43 A: i n- i remember i went to a private school in grade twelve and and um 

525.54 529.85 A: th- the one of the girls that my classmate said was a resident 

530.69 533.54 A: and she was reading catcher in the rye [laughter] 

533.12 537.13 B: right i think that might have been one that would've been banned years ago 

534.81 536.30 A: [laughter] yeah like 

536.71 538.82 A: yeah like they took it away from her 

539.40 543.00 A: and i remember my grandmother reading peyton place you know 

543.01 544.74 B: oh yeah 

543.63 556.12 A: and uh and she had to cover it to read it [laughter] because she didn't want anybody to know she was reading it you know but i mean this i this is a bit off topic but it was [lipsmack] it's how ideas [lipsmack] 

547.57 548.56 B: [laughter] 

556.80 565.94 B: it's funny you say that i- because when i was a child i loved to read as well and my mom was reading rosemary's baby 

556.84 557.83 A: happen 

565.57 566.84 A: oh [laughter] 

566.12 571.07 B: and i sh- i'd snuck it because i was- it was supposed to be you know 

570.83 572.24 A: yeah yeah 

571.32 577.44 B: scary and she didn't want me to read it and so that whole thing about putting a ban on it 

577.51 579.67 B: i s- s- snuck it and read it 

579.24 579.92 A: (( yeah )) 

580.41 587.35 A: [laughter] well you think you're missing something so you go [laughter] you go outta your way to try to find out what it is 

582.80 584.54 B: [laughter] sure yeah 

586.27 589.13 B: and i think the kids would do that too they prob- 

588.10 591.89 A: i i believe so you know like w- like what are they trying to hide 

591.83 599.52 B: right it's just to me it doesn't make sense especially with the harry potter books because it's so many kids love them 

598.89 599.89 A: (( oh i mean ))
