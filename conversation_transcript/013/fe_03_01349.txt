7.49 8.71 A: you what 

8.49 10.71 B: oh i just had a kid come into the room 

10.63 11.83 A: (( oh okay )) 

10.88 12.33 B: your name was lisa

16.52 17.66 A: okay 

17.73 20.38 B: and i i totally forgot about this project 

20.15 22.48 A: so did i [laughter] 

21.24 24.29 B: [laughter] it's like this is who [laughter] 

23.00 25.64 A: okay the topic i- i- is on 

24.80 27.60 B: is cen- censorship with books 

27.02 29.40 A: right and do you believe that 

29.94 31.56 A: the school have a right 

31.60 32.73 B: right 

31.65 33.69 A: to censor what books the kids read 

33.36 37.69 B: well they they did say private and public i think in a private school they do 

37.53 39.82 A: oh i agree with you a hundred percent there 

39.01 50.39 B: because you know it's their parents are paying for them to have a very set curriculum and very controlled but in a public school setting i don't think so i i think that should be up to the parents [sigh] 

43.86 45.18 A: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

50.26 52.66 A: yeah i i i agree with you there too 

53.28 62.89 A: uh there are some books out there that some kids would like to i mean i've even seen a t._v. show where that was the topic and this kid was getting kicked out of school for reading huckleberry finn 

62.89 72.42 A: and because it wasn't in the school curriculum and and i saw nothing wrong with that book you know i- i- i- i i didn't understand you know if it's in the public library [laughter] 

72.20 76.63 B: yeah i- i'm not sure why they would do that there's a lot of racism in that book 

76.48 77.51 A: right 

77.12 84.62 B: but racinism is something that children need to learn about and i'd rather them learn about it in a fantasy setting than in real life [laughter] 

80.29 81.69 A: that's right 

83.93 85.07 A: exactly 

85.09 88.47 A: and and the teachers are there to guide them in the right direction 

88.53 89.74 B: mhm 

88.75 91.63 A: a- as far as any racism or something like that 

92.61 93.62 A: (( so )) 

93.35 99.17 B: right i haven't i have not run into any problems with that yet with my my kids my oldest is only eleven 

98.89 103.05 A: okay my my only is two and a half so i i've got a lot way to go 

102.86 108.60 B: you got a long ways to go yeah [laughter] but i would have a problem if the school was to tell me [mn] 

108.70 111.30 B: what my children could not read 

110.71 112.85 A: exactly exactly 

111.52 120.20 B: i'm i'm very involved with their education and i do a lot of research and i choose books for them that i want them to read sometimes based on 

120.31 122.95 B: different concepts that i want them to learn 

122.58 123.54 A: mhm 

123.12 126.75 B: um i just picked a book called island of the blue dolphins 

126.70 127.62 A: okay 

127.33 135.03 B: which deals with a- abandonment and survival and living a- alone a girl who's abandoned by her family 

135.99 136.94 B: and 

137.29 144.22 B: i i think it's a great great book [laughter] i read it first and it talked about inner strength and 

142.34 143.33 A: (( [mn] [cough] )) 

145.54 158.02 B: they did have it it was a fantasy setting they were they were i think on a tropical island and everybody moved and they like forgot her [laughter] and they all moved accidentally without her and left her behind [lipsmack] 

153.91 154.72 A: (( oh )) 

157.92 158.63 A: (( mm )) 

159.13 162.56 B: but she had to look to herself then to survive and 

161.80 162.96 A: exactly 

162.63 164.66 B: i thought it had really good 

165.60 172.95 B: r- really good messages and i- i- it did send my daughter into tears a few times because she was crying and said 

170.56 171.61 A: (( mhm )) 

172.27 173.24 A: sure 

173.26 173.99 B: but 

174.27 175.42 B: you know that's 

175.82 179.47 B: those emotions too are all part of life and 

179.05 181.10 A: well that's right that's right 

182.14 184.27 A: you know i wouldn't want my um 

185.26 192.98 A: the school to have my child reading books about you know th- the k._k._k. and um white supremacism and things like that 

193.04 195.64 A: you know i wouldn't mind them banning that kind of reading 

195.99 197.19 A: um 

197.46 202.25 A: but things like well like you're talking about that that would instill a certain message into 

202.35 208.07 A: the child you know to help them with with their growing up a- and the turmoil that they're going to go through 

203.12 204.25 B: mhm 

207.68 216.81 B: right well you still may at p- some point may want to have your child read a book on the k._k._k. and that would open up then an opportunity for you to discuss 

208.08 209.19 A: trying to reach 

213.04 213.97 A: mhm 

216.73 217.71 A: right 

217.23 221.58 B: th- those situations and for you to help guide their moral outlook 

221.62 226.85 B: as opposed to them hearing about it on some talk show or 

226.16 228.13 A: [mn] oh oh sure yeah 

227.11 228.32 B: because it's [noise] 

228.53 233.72 B: so you know it's like i i would have a problem if their school was to assign a book on the k._k._k. 

233.13 237.17 A: oh yeah that's basically that's that that's really that's what i what i'm thinking yes 

235.55 236.28 B: but 

236.46 246.80 B: yeah but if i- if i want to my children to read it and it'll help open dialogue i have problems with the i- the homosexuality issues so 

247.12 251.07 B: i [laughter] i have to get books to help me with those and [mn] 

250.14 251.79 A: sure sure 

251.84 255.57 B: and help me with the dialogue and sometimes that that just helps 

255.61 256.25 B: [laughter] 

256.82 259.59 A: yeah i i think no one should um i 

259.68 264.42 A: i to me it's up to the the individual's choice on what they read or listen to or watch 

264.32 265.35 B: mhm 

264.97 270.47 A: you can change the channel you cannot buy the c._d. huh and you could just not read the book 

271.00 275.46 A: you know so i i don't think the schools should ban the the public schools should ban it 

273.97 279.73 B: mm mm right this i- it's too sensitive and it crosses too many family barriers and 

279.04 280.19 A: (( mhm [mn] [mn] )) 

280.00 280.94 B: different 

281.29 289.26 B: you know like huckleberry finn i can't imagine why anyone would have a problem with that that was classical literature i think i read it in school when i was a kid 

285.49 286.17 A: e- 

288.27 296.93 A: exactly exactly you know and it was so funny for for me to see a t._v. show that that addressed that book in particular and i was like jeez 

289.64 290.20 B: (( mm )) 

297.14 303.59 A: and i'm sure the show was family ties i saw it on a rerun recently and i and i was like wow [laughter] 

299.32 300.39 B: mhm 

305.09 306.03 A: (( i- )) 

305.31 312.74 B: actually one of my favorite stories is the king and i and i- it deals a lot with with slavery and polygamy [laughter] 

308.22 309.22 A: (( i- mhm )) 

312.75 315.16 B: some guys like fifty wives [noise] um 

315.55 316.94 A: oh yeah 

318.85 326.92 B: i can't really decide what what we shouldn't be doing it's so hard to think of ten minutes worth of stuff i'm trying [laughter] [lipsmack] 

324.32 325.30 A: i know 

325.89 327.10 A: (( [cough] )) 

327.40 329.52 B: so do you read to your child now 

329.30 331.79 A: oh i've been reading to him since before he was born 

332.41 334.79 B: oh before you started before okay i 

332.53 333.72 A: and he um 

334.36 344.45 A: he absolutely loves books um he he's to a point now though that i'm being being only two and a half uh he has a very large vocabulary already 

336.21 337.23 B: mhm 

344.14 345.24 B: mhm 

344.42 356.33 A: joseph i mean he he he'll read the pictures to me you know tell me the story you know like tell me the story and he'll tell me you know what's happening in the pictures and sometimes he just gets frustrated and he'll say the end and walk away 

356.40 357.51 A: you know he 

356.50 360.87 B: yeah i i have a one and a half year old too and her favorite are the counting books 

360.74 361.52 A: uh-huh 

361.03 364.60 B: she likes counting books counting back and forth [laughter] 

364.79 366.06 A: oh that's great 

365.69 373.57 B: it's it's funny because she'll put the book in the different directions the going up and down and you know she really enjoys that and 

366.24 367.14 A: great 

374.45 378.61 A: yeah mine's mine's got been into books since god i can't even remember when 

379.10 380.58 A: always had books 

381.07 391.58 B: yeah i started them at at birth i didn't start at before that [laughter] but at birth and w- with the children i i- i find it really hard but i try to find books that show 

391.49 406.38 B: kids of different ethnic groups and stuff all together i live in california which is very ethnically diverse it's actually hard to find books like that it's it's especially ten years ago with my older one there was like none it was very difficult 

394.06 395.86 A: oh sure sure 

399.87 401.20 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

406.48 410.52 B: they would you could find all the different races but not all together [laughter] 

409.88 410.79 A: right 

412.12 415.56 A: also i like um i have him watching the disney channel all the time 

415.33 416.49 B: mhm 

415.65 420.04 A: and you see a lot of the the diversity in the races on 

420.18 425.10 A: even the cartoon scam ring that's on in the morning and i i think that is fantastic 

422.60 424.62 B: mhm 

425.42 429.45 A: um because he does have cousins that are are inter racial 

429.59 435.70 A: and i i don't want him grow you know i want him growing up loving all a- and um 

436.49 437.73 A: understanding 

438.82 439.78 A: (( so )) 

439.81 445.49 B: yeah that's kinda i i been teaching sorta like that it's more like accepting it's that you don't think anything of it 

443.90 444.87 A: yes 

445.26 446.33 A: (( mhm )) 

445.67 451.16 B: you know someone's skin color is not a- any more interesting than having different colored hair [laughter] 

450.41 452.39 A: and that's right that's right 

452.01 457.20 B: and it works using books and programs like that does work my children are very 

457.62 462.85 B: accepting and open and it took my older daughter's got a blind boy in her class now 

463.57 477.52 B: and it took me a long time to figure out that he actually was blind [laughter] because he was just so accepted and she thought nothing of it and she talked about him like he was anybody else and i had asked her if he was blind and she said no but he had a braille writer 

466.49 467.54 A: really 

469.80 470.80 A: uh-huh 

477.78 482.79 B: [laughter] and all his his work has to be translated so i was trying to figure out what what was going on 

482.52 483.63 A: (( right )) 

484.34 485.94 B: but she she just 

486.65 490.30 B: th- that i knew that he was blind she didn't really give that much thought at all 

489.95 492.07 A: a- at that age they probably don't 

490.50 491.72 B: it was just much more 

492.08 494.49 B: much more interesting that he had a braille writer 

494.67 495.92 A: exactly 

496.02 497.16 A: exactly 

496.03 496.88 B: (( [laughter] )) 

499.41 503.17 A: and you've got to teach your kids that there is there are people out there that are different 

503.20 504.23 B: mhm 

503.21 505.28 A: (( in -n -n many different ways )) 

504.72 512.16 B: yeah i'm really glad she's getting exposed to someone like that at such a young age and is so accepting of him and 

508.70 509.51 A: (( mhm )) 

512.35 517.46 B: that he was his parents did not segregate him he's in their with the rest of the kids 

518.05 520.10 B: doing the same things 

522.52 536.91 A: and in fact i i'm a little nervous that [mn] i won't be able to keep up with him once he starts [laughter] school and and the homework assignments that he brings home um i'm i'm really fearful that i won't be able to help him with his homework the way the kids are so much more advanced than i was a child 

537.07 537.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

537.35 540.71 B: well if you're a stay at home mom you can get involved at school 

540.55 542.31 A: yeah well see i work full time 

540.86 541.95 B: so you're right 

542.04 544.43 B: ah oh that makes it harder 

544.09 545.36 A: yes it does 

546.31 550.99 B: and it sounds like you may have a bright one though too so they have a the gate program 

550.78 551.89 A: (( mhm )) 

551.21 553.90 B: well at least here in california they have a gate program 

554.02 557.77 B: it's for the the gifted and talented education and 

556.47 557.31 A: right 

558.44 564.65 B: they challenge the kids more at school th- their assignments are modified and then they have additional classes 

564.36 565.42 A: (( right )) 

564.76 572.85 B: that are after school that are really fun they do things like plays and have science projects and stuff and it really helps with that 

569.23 571.20 A: (( mhm )) 

573.03 579.86 A: yeah i i plan on relying on the school to you know broaden his horizons and and extend his mind as much as they can 

579.57 580.69 B: mhm 

580.87 586.16 A: so getting back to the topic you know i i really don't agree that they should censor 

586.45 587.98 A: you know what he reads 

588.10 589.08 A: (( um )) 

591.02 592.87 B: what should they censor it based on 

593.80 596.29 A: well that was the topic of th- on books 

596.68 597.89 B: mhm 

597.29 599.89 A: for tonight it was the topic censoring the books that they re-
