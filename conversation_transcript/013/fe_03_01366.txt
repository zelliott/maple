0.00 1.51 B: this is krisha 

1.34 3.04 A: hi this is travis 

4.48 5.50 A: how are you 

5.29 6.66 B: (( good how are you )) 

6.47 7.89 A: (( good good )) 

7.27 8.41 B: [laughter] 

8.55 11.35 A: [laughter] i haven't done this yet so this is my first time 

10.16 13.00 B: (( i know me either i didn't know there were gonna be two of us )) 

12.99 14.65 A: yes yeah so 

13.88 16.65 B: well that's a very broad subject um 

16.23 18.67 A: very broad i'm a teacher so 

18.21 21.26 B: oh no so you really have an opinion 

21.38 24.98 A: no not really but uh yeah so what do you think 

22.27 23.52 B: (( oh okay )) 

24.46 25.96 B: (( [laughter] um )) 

26.66 27.85 B: (( i'm gonna say )) 

27.89 33.44 B: no but only because um i think it's the parents' responsibility to uh 

32.43 33.40 A: yeah i 

34.61 41.38 B: i think i think if the parents are are are um educating their children that whatever they read isn't gonna have the same effect 

41.63 48.34 A: i i agree with that uh except for at the same time you might have parents irregardless of whether or not let's say 

48.15 60.38 A: you do let's say for example i've heard of schools banning like slaughterhouse five and so what say the parents are educating them what the problem is is that the parents still may have a problem with them reading that magazine or that book does 

61.08 62.46 A: that make sense 

61.91 63.72 B: that does make sense 

63.83 64.90 A: (( so um )) 

63.83 64.53 B: i 

64.96 72.56 A: [sigh] i i don't know i don't think you should um and of course you would love to have parents that are educated themselves and have a 

72.50 85.27 A: a uh a a broad out- you know an outlook on life or on education but at the same time i i don't think it matters where you're gonna be that you're gonna have parents that are ignorant or have different views than what the school system has 

85.51 88.68 A: so th- that's gonna play a lot into it 

88.12 95.23 B: so uh in other words we might need some censorship because the parents just aren't educating their children or their parents don't want them to read the book 

94.95 107.00 A: yeah i think the i think the personally i think that the parents would have a bigger problem with it than a lot of the kids and their parents are gonna be the one that you know they're going to complain 

106.87 107.78 B: (( yes )) 

107.36 111.86 A: and when they complain then the school's are gonna back down [laughter] 

111.90 119.34 A: there's no if ands or buts the schools will back down and [sigh] say okay your kid doesn't have to read that so i 

118.81 123.57 B: so is the question really does the school have a right to put it f- put the book out anyway 

124.55 127.89 A: i don't yeah i i guess i don't know i don't i don't 

127.93 129.57 A: know what i would think of 

128.47 137.11 B: now i'm thinking well the parents are paying for the school with their tax dollars so i guess maybe they should have a little bit of a say in what books are going out there 

132.75 133.88 A: (( [mn] sure )) 

137.35 149.16 A: yeah yeah i agree with that but at the same time you know maybe a parent i don't know i mean you have a lot of you know you have to think a large per- percentage of the population of your students their parents are 

149.49 152.78 A: probably uneducated or under educated 

152.23 152.98 B: (( yes )) 

152.93 164.47 A: and so they may have a totally different view than what the k- you know the kids are you know dad or mom works in a factory uh you know they might not see the attributes of a piece of literature 

164.44 169.40 A: that they uh the teacher does or you know or what the school believes at how it could benefit 

169.42 170.79 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

169.87 173.87 B: and if you if you were catering to every single parent's um 

174.33 180.02 B: opinion then i i can't imagine you would have much left in the schools to read 

178.40 179.40 A: well no 

179.87 183.46 A: no and depending on your school systems there isn't like you know 

183.57 188.80 A: they have to read just i don't know not even some of the classics they can't read so 

189.36 192.99 A: [sigh] not being a literature teacher i don't know you know 

193.04 201.61 A: quite a bit but i don't know uh currently our students are reading grapes of wrath so they're having a big problem with that 

201.02 201.98 B: why 

202.49 207.66 A: oh well it's a pretty bland book that and i.e. teaching this to their schools so 

208.04 209.10 A: the uh 

209.11 219.56 A: they're doing more of a movie and looking at excerpts than they are actually reading it but we did have parents complaining we were uh we had some students reading catcher in the rye [sigh] 

219.77 220.80 B: mhm 

220.52 224.21 A: and uh it's more of a coming of age book 

224.67 226.62 A: and i think that's the right one 

226.65 231.26 A: and um [sigh] we did have some problems with that 

230.67 234.36 B: did any parents pull their kid out of the class or just say my kid's read this 

232.88 243.74 A: uh didn't pull out but isn't is more of an optional that they could read for like extra credit and one or two of the parents did not want them reading it 

243.42 247.70 B: so it went from being an assignment to being extra credit because the parents objected 

246.10 249.93 A: well it yeah yes exactly 

250.10 251.04 A: so 

251.27 254.20 A: it went to being you know more extra credit but 

254.41 262.18 A: uh i don't know and who knows that the kids the children are going to get the analogies in there or what not you know they might read shakespeare 

262.22 264.94 A: [sigh] and there's just some you know there's some 

265.12 273.45 A: uh lewd language in there if you actually understand it so should i don't know i guess we might we som- we're somewhat getting off track i suppose but 

272.39 279.91 B: [laughter] i i'm really on the fence on the issue too because i i i don't wanna see his stuff banned i don't think it should be banned but um 

279.13 280.85 A: no i agree with you [sigh] 

280.29 282.41 B: i think the parents should have a say 

282.33 292.32 A: i think the parents should have a say to a point but when their children rea- reach a certain age you know they don't say who their kids can date probably per se or what their kid can do 

292.56 304.40 A: uh the child should have a right of whether or not they wanna believe that or not it's part of helping them to you know uh get their own sense of identity and get their own you know ideas for themselves so 

303.99 305.17 B: exactly 

305.01 314.66 A: i i don't necessarily believe that the parents should have a say on what could be censored i don't know it's a it's a very mixed topic and i'm sure 

314.94 326.61 A: [sigh] but i think it i and i think it differs censorship differs at different schools as well i uh i do work at a uh a catholic school also 

326.81 334.85 A: uh doing some tutoring and there the children are much more or the parents are much more open to higher education 

335.48 340.54 A: and letting their children read more books and what not that they don't censor so 

340.08 341.35 B: they don't censor 

341.58 343.89 A: uh not nearly as much 

343.66 347.58 B: gee that that's the environment where they can it's a private school right [mn] 

346.90 353.52 A: yeah oh definitely but i see more leeway there than i do at the public schools 

352.96 355.24 B: i am really surprised 

354.74 358.50 A: well you know most of these parents have money 

358.80 365.52 A: you know i mean when you're talking you're you're talking about a parent paying seventy five hundred dollars a year per kid 

364.95 366.09 B: yeah 

365.69 372.30 A: most of them have got like a really good job or something and they they have a higher level of education than your public school students 

370.44 371.69 B: oh so they're more 

371.94 373.82 B: they're more open to the literature [mn] 

374.14 376.72 A: that's what i'm assuming from what i've seen 

377.45 380.76 A: they're more open to letting their children explore things 

381.24 384.57 A: than i think a lot of public school parents 

385.26 389.13 A: so and i could be totally wrong this could just be my 

387.94 391.63 B: no that's a good theory that's a good theory [laughter] 

390.03 390.73 A: yeah 

391.42 393.44 A: (( so i don't know )) 

393.46 396.79 B: i'm trying to think if there's anything else you can ban besides books 

396.79 406.87 A: uh well i'm sure you can ban certain uh you can censor certain things like uh kansas has had the problem with uh teaching evolution and not teaching it 

407.98 409.12 B: oh yes 

408.22 409.14 A: in the 

409.31 422.46 A: [sigh] in their school system so you can have that as well you know what do you wanna teach and i i w- i was reading the other day i forget where at but um you know they wanna teach creation as you know creationism 

422.35 429.11 A: within a school district and you know that's a real touchy k- subject of how do you word it you know 

427.96 430.67 B: and doesn't that cross over church and state 

430.51 439.53 A: right you know so they wanna have something that says you know a creator or a god not go- you know not any specific god 

440.02 445.10 A: could've created or how did they call it like a divine creator or a devine 

443.79 444.56 B: yeah 

445.12 451.03 A: something created you know like the mult- you know cells or what not so and that can be censored too 

451.06 451.99 A: so 

452.38 456.69 A: uh i don't know i mean i live in the bible belt so 

456.94 466.35 A: there are a lot more people pro creationism than let's say per per se evolutionism or evolution i guess that'd be 

466.65 469.64 A: so i they can you know censor that 

469.32 474.92 B: does that community have anything in sp- anything specifically that they censor more than others 

474.39 480.43 A: uh no not re- not that i've seen no there may be but uh 

480.49 485.89 A: [sigh] i'm not familiar with the biology and what they teach you know the biology section of the school 

485.45 486.42 B: yeah 

486.16 494.47 A: um so i'm not sure but i'm sure that it is a it can be censored especially if the parents come in i think parents play 

494.87 502.50 A: play a bigger part than most people think you got a parent come in and hoo and holler there might be a hundred students but one parent comes in 

502.65 507.11 A: the uh faculty and the uh mainly the administration are going to 

507.23 510.29 A: cater more to that parent because they're raising a big fuss 

508.70 509.85 B: because they made 

510.07 511.46 B: the most noise 

511.35 516.24 A: that's right and it shouldn't always be that way but that's how it usually works 

516.42 517.56 A: so 

518.12 526.12 A: you know there might be a small percentage of the population of the you know the parents within the school but [sigh] they're making their voice heard or [sigh] 

526.40 528.70 A: you know heard louder so 

529.20 531.66 A: they have a larger say i think 

532.72 534.00 A: i i don't know 

534.24 543.12 A: but i don't have any children so i don't kn- i don't know what i would think on that if i had children and you know per se wanting you know whether or not i wanted them to 

535.81 538.24 B: yeah me either yeah [laughter] 

543.22 546.17 A: uh hear something or read something 

546.36 548.34 A: so i don't know 

548.73 551.56 A: but i you know not being in that position 

551.00 558.96 B: i think there's maybe a few things i wouldn't want my kids exposed to i once uh worked in a in the library in junior high and found a book on hunting 

559.49 568.10 B: and i didn't think that was appropriate [laughter] th- the kids my age what was i sixth grade learn how to kill animals so i removed the book from the library 

561.81 562.69 A: sure 

567.94 569.80 A: [laughter] 

568.52 570.59 B: [laughter] 

570.70 572.18 A: okay 

571.80 574.41 B: so i was practising my own censorship 

574.38 576.39 A: yes you were practising your own 

575.83 577.52 B: in the sixth grade 

577.81 581.18 A: [laughter] that's interesting 

578.95 580.07 B: [laughter] 

581.84 583.04 B: but you know 

582.08 583.06 A: (( so so- )) 

583.19 584.40 A: (( should you know )) 

583.45 584.01 B: (( [mn] )) 

584.47 588.81 A: should they remove that then should it have been removed other than you removing it 

589.13 590.43 B: i uh i 

591.63 592.68 B: think so 

593.49 598.49 A: right and what else then you said you had a couple of things that you think you would censor 

598.86 599.95 B: oh uh
