26.59 28.78 A: right i believe that too 

30.14 32.12 B: okay [laughter] 

31.50 34.04 A: and what else what are we doing anyway 

33.79 41.14 B: um [cough] we're [laughter] we supposed to discuss this topic for ten minutes [laughter] 

35.16 36.19 A: [laughter] 

40.08 47.17 A: discuss the topic of whether students should be allowed to read whatever they wanna read in public schools or in private schools

74.79 75.76 B: um 

79.27 88.87 B: well i guess because um i don't know if you remember when they were trying to ban some books from being read in school like the harry potter books

88.47 89.36 A: (( right ))

118.55 120.28 B: right exactly 

119.63 122.96 A: they shouldn't expose other children to that

159.01 160.05 B: but um 

160.20 164.31 B: yeah i i agree with you there that they have to uh 

164.67 167.26 B: have some kinda guidelines 

166.67 167.98 A: yes they do 

168.32 169.10 B: um 

168.35 179.39 A: because some people wouldn't want their children to go to school and read some of those things or even hear about 'em or even know the words i i don't no i don't think that's good 

175.55 176.81 B: mm right 

178.51 180.82 B: right just like the war now 

180.63 183.75 A: right a lot of that people don't want their children to hear 

183.31 186.56 B: right but it's gonna be in history books you know [laughter] 

185.93 188.96 A: yeah one way or another maybe not right 

188.38 190.14 B: right right

200.27 204.57 A: okay and so you just discuss it and then what do they do with it 

203.98 212.43 B: um i don't know what they do with it i guess they listen to it and see what everybody's thinking i don't know [laughter] but um 

210.74 211.48 A: (( oh )) 

211.60 216.84 A: well like i think getting back to that i think that children should be protected 

217.35 221.48 A: uh little children should be protected from things and i think it's um 

221.57 233.90 A: you know up to society to try to protect 'em and and i don't i don't think they should be exposed to horrible awful murder and rape and all those things that um 

233.40 234.51 B: right 

234.53 235.46 B: right 

234.65 248.50 A: i i when i was in the sixth grade i had a teacher who every morning read us what was in the paper about the suzanne dagnon murder and you won't remember it because you sound a lot younger but it it was horrible and it stayed with you your whole life 

241.84 242.97 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

248.01 254.24 B: right yeah well yeah that to me is torturing children [laughter] basically 

252.67 253.65 A: well 

253.70 254.90 A: mhm 

254.25 256.69 B: um but yeah i um 

257.45 268.87 B: i agree with you that uh there should be some kind of a guideline there uh maybe age appropriate um but this getting back to harry potter 

268.89 274.05 B: to me i that's for all all ages i even read 'em [laughter] you know what i mean 

273.07 278.96 A: yeah well harry potter is like a fairy tale anything that they know is not real is fine 

278.62 280.09 B: (( right b- )) 

279.22 283.15 A: they should be a i mean it's everybody reads harry potter 

282.48 287.57 B: right but you still had those parents trying to ban 'em from school

298.58 302.04 A: well people have tried to ban halloween too it's the same thing 

301.80 308.94 B: right right like in school we don't have halloween parties anymore we have harvest parties 

304.67 305.77 A: mhm 

306.96 307.96 A: right 

309.08 315.73 A: yeah and because it's supposed to be evil but all that is just you know it's fantasy and children know it

333.23 335.67 A: yeah i've been um 

335.88 343.02 A: in a situation when my children were in grammar school that one of the people in the p._t._a. was trying to ban a lot of books but they weren't 

343.02 355.99 A: horrible books they were more harry potter sort of things too oh i know what it was i think it was the um remember when they had the black rabbit and the white rabbit and they and they were friends 

343.99 345.12 B: mhm 

346.26 347.34 B: right 

356.04 360.67 A: that was they tried to ban that now wasn't that stupid 

356.89 357.96 B: yes 

358.02 359.10 B: yes 

360.35 364.49 B: yeah why why is that is that because of the colors

364.80 366.21 B: yeah 

366.04 368.01 A: yeah that was really bad 

367.42 369.95 B: yeah oh gosh

373.26 376.15 B: oh yeah oh 

375.01 379.00 A: but and they may have done it because that's not around any more 

378.42 381.75 B: mhm well just like they banned pledge allegiance 

382.37 387.88 A: uh yeah but it is that's because it says god in it and they're trying to separate church and state 

384.86 385.78 B: (( yeah )) 

387.26 394.61 B: yes which to me is silly i mean we said a pledge of allegiance every day [laughter] 

392.83 398.57 A: it is it is silly because that's what it says are they going to ban quarters 

398.01 399.87 B: [laughter] exactly 

399.64 403.53 A: isn't that where it says in god we trust or is that dimes 

403.23 407.18 B: um i i really don't know i tell you it's one of 'em 

405.58 406.53 A: yeah

411.78 413.79 B: yeah that's true but 

413.03 415.86 A: um it's just it's your heritage 

415.62 417.50 B: right right 

417.42 421.38 A: but i do think they should ban the confederate flag so there you go 

420.75 424.23 B: well yeah [laughter] me too 

423.39 425.46 A: but that's not books 

425.26 426.51 B: right 

426.20 429.01 A: (( so i i um i don't know i mean i )) 

429.99 434.65 A: [lipsmack] i don't know that but i know some of the things i read i certainly wouldn't want my children reading 

434.62 438.65 B: well yeah yeah like i said it would have to be age appropriate 

438.85 440.95 A: mm some things aren't 

440.58 441.69 B: right 

441.10 442.92 A: ever age appropriate 

442.44 443.65 B: no

467.99 469.37 B: oh really 

468.77 476.13 A: yeah so well i suppose we should talk about more books how many how long is ten minutes anyway [laughter] 

469.57 470.90 B: oh 

473.40 474.21 B: ye- 

475.53 481.99 B: [laughter] i don't know i think it should soon be up uh at least it feels like it huh [laughter] 

479.43 480.27 A: uh-huh 

481.30 485.01 A: uh well yeah because you can't think of that much to say about it 

484.43 486.34 B: right right 

485.71 489.26 A: if you disagreed i suppose you could argue but um 

489.28 491.62 B: [laughter] yeah oh 

490.48 494.36 A: but the people with children feel pretty much the same way 

493.88 495.41 B: right uh-huh 

494.82 496.70 A: i actually have five 

496.36 497.56 B: oh do you 

497.31 498.43 A: yes 

497.84 499.13 B: (( oh my )) 

499.16 500.02 B: well 

500.28 503.48 B: um all different ages i mean 

503.17 505.87 A: yeah all different sexes so 

505.66 506.66 B: uh-huh 

506.07 511.01 A: three boys two girls um and i i have grandchildren as well 

510.71 512.07 B: oh okay 

511.90 515.72 A: who are in public school but i've had children in private school 

515.10 516.30 B: oh have you 

516.80 522.90 A: but they're they're all grown now and so you know it wasn't such an issue they didn't have such 

522.93 525.02 A: trashy books back then 

524.59 525.79 B: right 

525.84 529.88 B: right yeah i don't think they should be able to take those um 

530.01 532.41 B: i call 'em smut books um 

531.56 534.65 A: well that's right but 

532.97 536.79 B: ye- those romance novels or whatever you wanna call 'em 

536.40 547.12 A: but who you but you see some people have a different idea of censorship like if you go to the movies or if you if you watch t._v. it's all full of um 

547.05 554.20 A: obscenities everything is so the children have really been exposed to that and yet they're not allowed to use the words 

548.01 549.06 B: right 

553.56 554.91 B: exactly 

554.81 555.85 A: so 

555.99 557.46 A: i think it's pretty 

557.47 558.82 A: hypocritical 

559.23 560.72 B: yeah that's true 

560.28 568.01 A: to let them go to movies which i think it's fine to let them go but i mean then they hear all these words and if they use it then they're 

568.12 571.10 A: they're banned from school or something that's wrong 

571.03 572.07 B: right 

571.81 573.46 A: they're just words 

573.55 575.05 B: right right 

574.77 575.80 A: but 

576.13 587.12 B: yeah i you know uh with the flag uh to me that's not religious you know that's just american [laughter] 

576.61 577.48 A: (( anyway )) 

587.06 589.59 A: you mean the re- the american flag 

589.02 590.32 B: yeah 

589.75 593.95 A: oh yeah well no that's not religious but it's because it says 

590.45 591.66 B: you know 

593.84 594.89 B: god 

594.22 596.87 A: under god that's why 

595.12 596.37 B: yeah 

597.10 599.89 A: it's not that those people don't respect the flag it's
