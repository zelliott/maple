117.58 118.35 A: oh 

120.52 129.51 B: time to find a place that actually gives the lessons and now we finally have it but it's just now a matter of carving out the time to go 

129.68 132.97 B: um you know we've been to a couple of functions where we 

130.02 131.22 A: right 

133.13 143.10 B: um you know where they play salsa or milengay music um but i know how to do it my husband doesn't so it's kind of difficult you know what i mean oh yeah 

142.13 144.12 A: (( ahah yeah )) 

143.79 146.47 B: because i do it myself and then he's not but then 

146.62 150.38 B: ah we've even tried walking um 

150.66 160.02 B: in the evenings you know after work and that way it gives us a chance to talk and spend some time you know just walking you know away from the kids or whatever 

160.83 161.65 B: so 

160.86 166.68 A: it's hard it's hard to find the time to work out when you're working full time you know it's like 

165.23 166.35 B: mhm 

166.89 173.96 A: it's ah in the mornings i'm too tired and after work i'm not very motivated so um 

170.90 174.42 B: mhm you almost have to do it at lunch time 

174.75 182.14 A: yeah i try to do that i i have a gym that i'm a member of and so i make it over there during lunch occasionally and that works pretty well 

179.83 180.83 B: mhm 

181.80 184.46 B: (( oh okay that sounds good )) 

182.17 182.91 A: yeah 

185.24 189.79 B: but then you're so tired i mean you're so hot it's difficult to go back to work 

190.08 195.08 A: yeah i wish they had more showers like our building doesn't have a shower [noise] in it um 

195.30 197.83 A: otherwise it would be great did you just hear a loud beep 

198.00 199.25 B: yeah i did 

199.21 200.51 A: yeah huh 

200.45 202.24 B: is that the battery of your phone 

202.25 204.71 A: no it must be something on their end 

204.53 205.62 B: (( oh okay )) 

205.79 208.04 B: all right but um 

208.79 216.02 B: yes see that's the thing is trying to work out but you know it's interesting i was watching the show um oprah winfrey 

216.11 218.87 B: and she is forty nine years old 

216.21 216.93 A: (( ahah )) 

219.24 227.30 B: and she's recently just seen the need within the past couple of years to really be in shape because before that she was up and down with her weight 

227.41 228.32 A: right 

227.57 230.83 B: and she works out in the gym six days a week 

231.15 232.28 A: wow 

232.10 233.37 B: (( six days a week )) 

233.66 234.77 A: that's a lot 

233.84 235.82 B: (( for two hours )) 

236.44 237.62 A: wow 

237.55 240.06 B: that's but she has a personal trainer 

240.07 244.43 B: and she's been able to get her weight down and keep it down 

245.26 247.15 B: but a lot of times people 

245.32 246.66 A: (( yeah )) 

247.33 252.41 B: will want to exercise not just for weight loss but just to maintain and just to be healthy 

252.42 253.16 A: (( ahah )) 

252.56 256.95 B: because you know as people we eat the wrong foods all the time anyway 

257.25 258.04 A: yeah 

257.47 262.04 B: foods that are high in cholesterol and things like that so we have to kind of keep our heart going 

262.30 263.43 B: um 

264.08 268.32 B: but they say there's a lot of things that that you can do for exercise too 

268.67 269.82 B: (( you know what i mean mhm )) 

268.88 269.59 A: (( yes )) 

270.01 281.27 A: well another thing i find it hard to do is cook well because you know i come home from work i'm usually really tired and really hungry so it's easier to make something fast that's unhealthy than to actually spend the time to cook something good you know 

280.52 283.37 B: exactly unless have you a salad already made mhm 

283.70 285.42 A: right exactly 

285.37 288.39 B: already made up in the beginning of the week or something like that 

285.93 286.49 A: (( [mn] )) 

288.72 289.91 B: and then um 

290.30 296.24 B: if you get a chance to do that plus a lot of times too i mean we're so busy and 

296.70 302.64 B: there's no more normal nine to five jobs any more now jobs can be ten hours a day mhm 

301.98 312.67 A: yeah i know it's it's it's horrible i mean it seems like working hours are getting longer and longer you know and companies will offer some perks like you know 

308.55 309.79 B: mhm 

312.75 318.22 A: to keep you at work but i would rather work fewer hours and make less money to be honest you know 

317.83 318.91 B: mhm 

318.97 322.53 B: mhm that way you have time to enjoy the money you make it's either it's either you 

321.93 330.30 A: (( exactly right yeah well )) 

323.07 323.93 B: (( have money it's )) 

329.89 332.04 B: (( either you have a job but no time or you don't have a job and you have )) 

332.20 333.11 A: right 

332.24 336.29 B: ((  )) 

337.43 338.15 A: (( yes )) 

338.02 341.68 B: you know what i mean you can run in the park jog around 

341.77 346.75 B: even some people that friends of mine they walk around the park in the evening 

347.28 357.96 B: you know what i mean like a bunch of my girlfriends and i may get together and we'll just do a brisk walk you know i mean around the park but then you've got to worry about safety issues 

347.82 348.88 A: yeah 

353.78 354.51 A: (( ahah )) 

358.72 363.02 A: that's true i try to ah try to [noise] like a lot of my 

363.08 376.54 A: ow that hurt a lot of my friends you know they want to when they want to socialize they want to go out to eat and ah but that gets expensive going to restaurants and stuff so i try and switch them to do things like go to a walk go for a walk together and that way 

376.55 384.42 A: you're not eating unhealthy food you're not spending a lot of money on eating out and you get to spend time with them and exercise at the same time and that works pretty well 

383.86 385.77 B: mhm yes or even skating 

386.99 389.58 A: (( skating um i haven't really done that )) 

387.71 388.46 B: yes 

389.01 391.36 B: skating is very good exercise 

391.35 393.21 A: oh like inline skates 

393.04 407.05 B: yeah or roller skating ice skating all of that is excellent excellent exercise yeah it's very good like it works like your legs and stuff like that your lower body plus it helps towards um 

394.60 395.19 A: (( ahah )) 

402.65 405.03 A: (( hm )) 

407.09 408.68 B: cardiovascular 

409.05 412.71 B: um what's that skating bowling 

414.25 416.08 B: you know what i mean all those things 

414.74 415.85 A: never been bowling 

416.29 417.88 B: yeah because it helps 

416.68 419.37 A: do you er do you bike at all 

419.72 421.24 B: do i ride a bike 

421.13 421.83 A: (( ahah )) 

421.61 427.10 B: i haven't rode a bike in years because i had um serious surgery a couple of years ago 

425.99 426.91 A: (( oh )) 

427.19 434.16 B: so i haven't um i actually want to start doing that again even if i do like a um a stationary bike 

434.37 438.43 B: um i don't think that i'm secure enough yet stationary enough to 

438.50 444.32 B: get on a real bike and actually be able to go but a stationary ba- bike um 

440.02 440.93 A: right 

441.76 442.53 A: (( ahah it's )) 

444.73 447.12 B: would actually be pretty good for me 

447.38 448.28 B: yeah 

447.47 451.80 A: a lot easier on your joints than running or anything like that that's for sure 

451.24 454.78 B: (( yeah yeah because they say jogging is not good for women )) 

455.92 459.39 A: yeah i think jogging in general is pretty rough on your body 

459.04 460.86 B: (( yeah it's bad on your knees )) 

461.02 464.88 B: on your ankles on your legs it's just all around 

465.22 466.26 B: can be 

465.62 466.40 A: i've 

467.69 468.58 B: go ahead
