6.36 7.57 B: (( nice to meet you too )) 

9.76 12.62 A: require students to read certain books 

12.11 14.95 B: i think that's what it said i couldn't really understand it 

14.66 18.50 A: no it sorta talked too fast but i guess we could act on that presumption 

18.24 19.51 B: mhm 

18.84 24.40 A: you know and then uh my husband answered it first and he said uh it was talking about censorship 

24.14 25.63 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

24.92 29.35 A: okay uh what did you understand from that because i didn't answer it first 

29.37 30.25 A: i didn't 

29.41 34.24 B: (( all it said was just censorship and then about the books yeah well i guess like certain books that they make you read they )) 

32.16 33.07 A: okay 

33.98 38.41 A: okay so um it wants us to talk about required reading 

39.17 44.03 A: and i guess uh censorship it thinks uh we should say whether 

44.52 46.22 A: someone should 

46.95 49.50 A: have to read material 

50.93 56.02 B: (( would make them read mhm yeah well i mean harry potter and like those yeah you know and then i personally did nine years in library service and i don't think that anybody can tell )) 

54.25 56.83 A: [noise] yeah like a reading list in school 

56.45 57.34 B: (( anybody what )) 

56.94 58.97 A: you know because otherwise 

57.87 58.68 B: (( not )) 

59.18 64.64 A: how are you gonna know what to read i know 

65.09 74.66 A: think about some things that are controversial that they don't they always complain about like um 

67.65 68.82 B: (( to read you know i mean even )) 

74.08 77.64 B: (( including you can ask my mom what necessarily your parents if you wanna read something because )) 

76.31 78.52 A: well that for one thing 

78.55 79.52 A: (( or things )) 

79.68 81.28 A: (( like older )) 

81.10 82.13 B: (( she took gone )) 

84.28 88.75 A: (( things like to kill a mocking bird whenever that comes up )) 

89.43 90.61 A: (( on a )) 

90.25 91.19 B: (( with the wind )) 

92.61 93.61 A: (( list )) 

93.75 94.93 A: (( there's always )) 

96.99 97.76 A: (( some )) 

97.77 98.62 B: (( away from )) 

99.11 103.04 A: (( people that are like not wanting people to read )) 

102.92 105.05 B: (( me when i was eight )) 

105.62 108.85 A: (( it because of the racial things in that mhm uh-huh )) 

109.89 111.25 A: (( i )) 

112.30 113.15 A: (( agree )) 

114.24 115.06 A: (( with )) 

115.30 117.13 A: (( that )) 

117.24 122.82 A: because and i didn't appreciate it and she never had any success at at controlling what i read 

117.81 118.92 B: (( you know mhm )) 

122.67 123.54 B: right 

122.89 126.21 A: because i just went to the library and read it in installments 

126.15 130.05 B: i mean it's better than watching t._v. the things that they see on t._v. anyway 

129.30 141.63 A: yeah i don't think anybody has the right to tell anybodys what they should or should or should not consume but as far as like reading lists in classes because they were gonna be on a topic 

141.88 148.69 A: and we need to hear how you feel about things like say golding lord of the flies that's a controversial book 

149.24 153.74 A: i can't discuss the rowling books with you because i haven't read those 

153.10 154.46 B: i haven't either 

153.94 163.57 A: you know but um are people against those because they have elements of uh say mysticism or magic or supernatural things those are things that also 

154.74 155.53 B: (( mm )) 

161.02 161.81 B: mhm 

163.91 166.16 B: but some kids 

165.01 167.19 A: incite or excite people 

167.23 172.60 B: right but some kids just really they enjoy reading things like that and 

171.32 173.59 A: well they sure do and you know they 

174.61 184.49 A: on the one hand people kinda wanna protect 'em while they think they're vulnerable and their their minds are growing and everything and they're afraid of certain topics you know 

184.45 185.46 B: yeah 

184.84 186.94 A: i might be inclined to think 

187.34 189.09 A: if i had children 

189.45 191.34 A: that books with 

191.54 196.14 A: say sexual content would disturb me for 

193.39 194.77 B: mhm 

196.23 203.58 A: certain ages i would wonder what was appropriate but again like i said you know they had no luck controlling what i read when i was a kid 

203.57 204.69 B: right 

204.67 207.14 A: and when i was a librarian 

207.30 209.86 A: i never tried to tell anyone 

210.28 211.91 B: so they can't read 

211.28 220.78 A: that they oughtn't you know what i would tell parents and i did in childrens services specifically [noise] was that they should read the material themselves 

221.03 223.83 A: and see just how uncomfortable they were with it 

223.24 226.27 B: yeah i agree with that the parents should read it 

226.48 232.61 A: they should read pretty much everything their kids read and then let the kid have a chance to decide you know 

228.68 229.76 B: mhm 

230.94 232.68 B: mhm and if they 

232.96 241.82 A: you can't control what's in another person's mind and then people read and write and it's a way that we have of [noise] communicating and understanding one another 

241.32 242.29 B: mhm 

242.25 244.05 A: and experiencing 

244.18 250.55 A: ideas and places that you might never get to go or be otherwise except for in the pages of a book 

250.99 253.25 A: [noise] so i'm totally like 

253.70 256.14 A: let's not censor you know 

255.73 257.53 B: i agree with that too 

256.71 259.02 A: but i'm not a parent 

259.17 259.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

259.54 261.95 A: are you you i hear a baby 

261.42 265.14 B: yeah i have a baby and a three year old so they're not old enough yet to 

263.06 269.29 A: yeah so you wouldn't but but you might have some ideas about how you'll feel later 

269.81 271.09 B: well i mean 

271.16 272.07 B: um 

272.22 275.03 B: i have a degree in early childhood education so 

274.32 275.34 A: uh-huh 

275.25 279.15 B: i mean as far as reading lists i think 

280.06 281.29 B: i mean uh 

281.61 286.82 B: i don't really think that most books that are offered in a public school library would be 

287.65 293.77 A: [noise] really objectionable a lot of the things that people object to they seem to be what we would might consider classics 

289.74 290.73 B: mhm 

293.10 294.44 B: right 

294.16 295.12 A: you know 

295.64 304.98 A: or some of some people who read would consider classics but then some people are just afraid of ideas some people are terrified of ideas 

301.23 302.83 B: (( mhm or else it )) 

304.20 305.84 B: well i mean like the new 

306.14 306.97 B: (( um )) 

307.25 309.45 B: harry potter things 

309.60 316.86 B: if i think they think you as a parent you should talk to your child about it about what's real and what's not 

316.29 318.07 A: right exactly 

318.93 321.72 A: that's that's more like a discernment issue 

321.52 322.56 B: mhm 

322.56 325.09 A: you know and then kids they do get um 

325.61 327.74 A: absorbed in things 

327.83 328.83 A: you know 

327.97 330.41 B: but it's just like television though 

330.21 336.97 A: it is and i'd prefer that they be absorbed in a book than flickering images on a screen 

334.94 335.85 B: mhm 

336.42 337.43 B: me too 

337.13 338.15 A: you know 

338.20 343.19 A: because at least they're doing their reading skills and learning new words and stuff 

342.85 345.01 B: and imaginations their 

344.33 351.81 A: i'm thinking when i was a child and i read the tolkien series for the first time i was pretty captivated and i still enjoy it as an adult 

351.51 352.58 B: mhm 

352.40 355.90 A: you know but nobody ever tried to tell me i couldn't have that 

356.57 357.60 B: [laughter] 

357.18 358.16 A: you know 

357.92 360.16 B: mhm and that's a fantasy but 

359.93 364.72 A: has anybody ever tried to keep anything from you did your parents let you read freely 

362.97 363.95 B: no 

364.44 366.88 B: no they didn't keep anything for from me 

366.43 368.33 A: what part of the country are you in 

368.47 370.15 B: uh i'm in arkansas 

369.83 377.82 A: oh okay and i'm in georgia so we're kind of in sort of similar neighborhoods in a way as far as you know being in the bible belt 

375.80 376.77 B: mhm 

377.27 378.45 B: mhm 

378.30 379.32 A: you know 

379.70 387.00 A: i'm not um i remember my mom taking gone with the wind away from me and then later she tried to take summer of forty two but i got it back 

386.78 387.74 B: [laughter] 

387.41 391.90 A: and if you didn't read that that had that was probably about sexual content that she was disturbed 

391.92 392.68 B: hm 

392.01 397.25 A: and then when you don't understand things about it [noise] about what you're reading 

395.06 395.99 B: mhm 

398.00 399.80 A: as you're reading it 

400.59 405.26 A: it doesn't do that much harm [noise] i don't think it didn't hurt me i mean 

402.63 403.31 B: (( mm )) 

403.46 404.35 B: (( no i )) 

405.91 408.40 A: with that book summer of forty two 

408.28 410.66 B: (( mean as long as it's age appropriate )) 

410.41 413.67 A: yeah but these things were not regarded as age appropriate 

413.50 414.47 B: oh 

414.12 418.02 A: you know that was that was probably why she was trying to protect me from that 

417.41 418.79 B: yeah 

418.42 422.88 A: because they were pretty mature i mean gone with the wind for an eight year old you know 

422.52 423.99 B: yeah true 

423.05 425.29 A: she had some issues with that 

425.95 429.43 A: but i still i st- i went and got it i slipped and read it anyway 

429.25 430.44 B: [laughter] 

429.70 431.51 A: at the public library 

431.99 435.13 A: because i couldn't stand it i was halfway through it 

434.57 436.01 B: (( well yeah i m- )) 

436.22 438.89 B: once you get hooked in a book it's hard to 

438.92 440.38 B: just put it down 

439.75 442.55 A: it was really really hard to keep me from reading 

442.47 443.41 B: mhm 

443.01 450.41 A: you know and and nobody does try any more of course you know i mean i'm in my forties and nobody's gonna try to tell me what to read and what not to read 

449.85 451.52 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

452.05 456.15 A: but it's it's difficult to control people and what's in their minds i just think 

456.39 460.44 A: having been a librarian i gotta i gotta say censorship is not the thing 

460.51 463.71 B: right and you know a lotta books you about a lot of 'em 

463.94 469.11 A: um i'll i can say another one that gets on school reading lists um huckleberry finn 

469.45 470.40 B: mhm 

469.51 472.43 A: people have a cow when that book comes up 

472.03 473.08 B: mhm 

472.97 474.14 A: because of 

474.56 481.49 A: ethnic usage you know and then maybe they don't read it in context and realize 

481.65 492.37 A: exactly what mark twain was saying about how wrong he felt about how it was to treat other people differently because of the colors of their skin and everything and he was very much against slavery 

492.46 493.43 B: mhm 

492.72 500.19 A: but people that have not read his works would not realize that because he uses the n. word on a re- regular basis but 

499.29 500.14 B: right 

500.27 507.44 A: that was common in his time it was it was kind of [noise] i don't like to say appropriate but 

507.46 509.65 A: it was what he knew [noise] 

509.85 518.01 A: but if you ever read more about him [noise] and how he felt growing up seeing people for sale he didn't like it at all 

510.00 510.96 B: well if 

517.55 521.69 B: mhm but that's the word that they used for it yeah 

520.54 523.89 A: that is exactly what they used for it 

522.44 524.49 B: they didn't change it to like 

524.23 525.86 A: in that day in time 

525.41 526.64 B: mhm 

526.51 530.42 A: you know when people were property when he was born people were property 

530.08 530.96 B: mhm 

530.83 536.20 A: and you know they did what they knew how to do then and when when they learned better they did better 

537.20 539.25 A: so i like the topic 

539.87 543.76 A: of of censorship the other one i got is this your first call 

543.35 544.53 B: yes 

544.44 545.64 A: let's see 

545.82 551.24 A: i got one more before about um your sources of news information 

551.29 555.27 A: and i had a interesting conversation with a woman from vancouver 

555.68 556.30 B: (( mm )) 

555.91 560.58 A: about you know different sources where you gotten most of your news if it was print or 

560.76 563.27 A: television media or whatever you know 

562.60 563.85 B: yeah 

564.41 567.15 A: and this was this was 

567.43 572.34 A: two and a half weeks ago i think i i wrote it down the date and i don't have that paper around me right now 

572.54 575.27 A: but the war was just starting to happen then too 

574.97 576.60 B: oh yeah 

576.05 579.76 A: so we were both listening and reading plenty of news you know 

578.68 579.76 B: (( mhm b- )) 

579.97 586.08 A: um it wouldn't be good for people to censor that kinda information and keep from us 

586.15 589.65 A: which is like who's to say they don't to a degree 

589.44 590.77 B: yeah they do 

590.32 598.20 A: i mean i'm sure they have to edit what they put out but it seems to me like we're getting and awful awful lotta information does it seem like that to you 

592.45 593.47 B: mhm 

597.44 599.89 B: yes more than what we should i think
