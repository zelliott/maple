2.34 3.27 B: hi 

2.86 5.21 A: hi my name's jessica 

5.02 6.03 B: i'm meredith 

5.92 7.50 A: nice to talk to you 

7.16 8.45 B: nice to talk to you too 

8.99 10.13 A: um 

10.40 15.54 A: okay well the only trial that i can really think of that i watched was the o._j. simpson of course 

15.60 23.68 B: yeah i kind of avoided that one just because there was so much hype going on around it um i mean i remember being in high school and um 

24.48 30.18 B: what's it called you're do you remember that trial where like it was one of the kennedy cousins i think was 

29.71 31.10 A: yeah the 

31.15 32.29 A: yes 

31.86 34.71 B: what was her name susan smith or something like that 

34.08 37.24 A: yes yes i believe you are right 

37.10 41.11 B: and she had a she had a blue spot on her face for like the whole thing 

41.36 43.76 B: and then they revealed her name afterwards i think 

44.82 48.12 A: i don't remember that part of it i only remember 

48.14 49.43 A: i remember the 

49.47 52.06 A: big hype on it being a kennedy of course 

51.70 53.22 B: right right 

53.00 54.12 A: yeah 

53.43 55.32 B: because it always is when it's one of them 

55.21 61.53 A: yeah the only i'm trying to think of another trial besides o._j. simpson that was hyped um 

62.77 64.89 A: something more recent probably 

65.29 68.91 A: well the the blake one going on right now will be 

69.07 70.19 B: what's that one 

69.89 71.89 A: the blake the um 

72.63 74.79 A: he was in dragnet 

74.80 76.43 A: he killed his wife 

76.10 78.39 B: oh that guy okay 

76.88 79.84 A: yeah ronald blake is his name i believe 

79.41 80.40 B: okay 

79.96 82.72 A: yeah he was accused of killing his wife 

82.78 87.54 B: right i think i remember reading about that on the internet but i actually don't watch a whole lot of television these days 

87.48 89.20 A: it's too depressing 

89.84 92.57 A: [laughter] all the trials and everything it's too depressing 

90.18 91.17 B: yeah 

92.43 97.17 B: i used to watch like you know judge walkner all the time when i was little [laughter] 

95.31 96.90 A: [laughter] 

96.95 100.46 A: yeah i like judge judy she just tells it like it is 

100.72 102.55 A: she's always yelling at 'em 

102.32 105.81 B: but i think that's more supposed to be like entertainment than 

105.84 108.30 B: than really you know actually watching 

108.58 111.71 B: um you know criminal or civil justice in progress 

112.11 113.82 A: very true very true 

114.39 115.55 A: she um 

116.62 127.24 A: i think it's kind of acting and when it gets to that point i can't maybe there are people that actually do those kind of things [laughter] that are on there but i don't know i've never seen it happen before [laughter] 

127.03 137.50 B: yeah i kind of get the impression that it's a very jerry springer kind of [laughter] kind of kind of person that you know that has their that has their disputes settled on television 

137.30 138.57 A: very true 

138.60 140.00 A: [cough] very true 

140.59 141.59 A: um 

142.42 145.99 B: but so do you think that do you think that big trials should be televised 

146.86 147.81 A: um 

148.44 153.14 A: [sigh] i don't know i would have to say that i would think that in some trials i mean 

153.38 160.01 A: it probably does affect or sway the jury although they're sequestered or whatever not supposed to see anything and i just [noise] you know i mean 

160.47 163.37 A: i can't imagine that they don't at least hear something 

163.41 174.59 B: yeah and it has got to be really hard on the on the people that are in the jury you know being separated from pretty much everything for such a long period of time because these important trials always last a really long time 

166.89 168.02 A: right 

169.69 171.22 A: exactly 

174.32 183.87 A: exactly i would you know i mean if i was to be on one of those i would think that it would just be easier to keep the cameras out of the t._v. out of out of the courtroom 

184.18 185.72 A: and it would save a lot 

186.05 188.02 A: you know of the hassle 

188.23 193.10 B: right i wonder if people really differentiate in their minds between um 

193.68 198.28 B: um you know between really large trials and smaller things like judge judy 

199.25 201.18 A: i don't know i mean 

202.02 207.22 A: i don't know i mean i found i watched i actually was in school when the whole 

207.34 215.15 A: o._j. simpson thing happened and the teacher was always emphasizing and talking about it and you know watching bits and pieces about what's going on 

215.21 224.36 A: and when i i have to think that some of the t._v. and how they actually show it kind of makes you sway your opinion 

224.58 225.51 B: yeah 

225.94 227.33 A: i don't i mean 

227.75 240.11 A: i of course i mean i have my own opinion about him being guilty but [laughter] at the same time you know i mean i'm sure there's a lot of evidence too that could have maybe persuaded someone to think differently 

233.00 234.01 B: [laughter] 

240.39 245.78 B: right yeah i mean it's hard to say i personally think he was guilty too 

245.54 251.56 A: right [laughter] but there has to be some reason i mean that those all those jurors found them 

246.19 247.04 B: [laughter] 

251.63 252.92 A: not guilty 

253.76 258.56 B: right and i don't really know what that would have been it was also it was also a long time ago 

255.79 257.98 A: i don't either [laughter] 

258.23 265.43 A: right everything i saw on t._v. [laughter] would totally make me think he was guilty but i mean i 

263.77 265.23 B: [laughter] 

266.21 272.69 A: mean i mean they could have very well just been more afraid of more riots and stuff like all that other kind of stuff oh the rodney king one 

271.05 273.58 B: oh the like after rodney king yeah 

272.72 281.17 A: there's another one [laughter] yeah that that was kind of scary i don't know where you live but i'm only probably about 

281.41 283.33 A: forty minutes from la 

283.00 288.18 B: oh wow yeah i was in houston at the time that that happened and yeah now i'm in iowa 

285.69 286.87 A: yeah 

288.15 289.37 A: oh wow 

288.90 292.20 B: yeah far from anything big [laughter] 

291.50 292.92 A: must be nice 

293.10 295.11 B: it gets kind of boring after a while 

294.55 300.35 A: [laughter] well i'd i'd like a little less excitement 

300.17 302.20 B: [laughter] i can understand that 

302.73 303.58 A: but 

302.83 306.86 B: so were you actually in town when the riots happened 

307.08 312.64 A: no no i was you know actually i think i was only 

312.69 313.89 A: god what 

314.81 317.43 A: (( seventeen when that happened [laughter] )) 

316.83 317.67 B: okay 

317.81 323.32 A: so i you know i wouldn't be down there i i live about forty minutes 

323.33 324.96 A: forty miles north 

325.14 333.43 A: so you go down there for everything i work down there but at the same time when i was younger i didn't leave town so i mean it wasn't a big thing for me except to watch it on tv 

333.43 334.32 B: okay 

334.74 336.59 B: still it had to be pretty frightening 

336.80 341.97 A: yeah because you know you kind of all know where they are going to go with that you just 

340.60 341.26 B: (( [cough] )) 

342.23 345.56 A: you don't know how far or whoever's going to take it 

345.43 348.83 B: and you have to wonder just how much the media coverage you know 

349.61 352.67 B: led to the situation being even more racially charged mhm 

352.02 354.31 A: oh i'm sure very much so 

354.95 356.45 A: very much so 

357.07 362.01 A: especially just like what the rodney king thing then turned into you know 

362.14 364.98 A: the big riots there and then that reginald dennie guy 

365.42 367.90 A: the white man that got pulled out of the 

367.94 369.07 A: car 

369.47 375.46 A: you know then it turns into two separate things and i don't know just turns into way too much 

376.28 377.46 A: but um 

377.82 384.97 B: it seems like people are willing to turn just about anything into entertainment today though i mean just look at how c._n._n. has been just non stop war coverage 

384.39 392.58 A: oh yeah everything anything anything to get people to watch it and i mean we know everybody knows we're going to watch it 

393.60 397.06 A: but i mean as far as trials i don't really find them as you know 

397.11 402.81 A: of course right now what's going on in the world is big news but as far as trials i mean they don't really 

402.87 406.76 A: affect me so much i guess i don't really find too much entertainment value out of them 

407.42 408.92 B: yeah i mean 

409.66 411.44 B: i guess there are people who 

411.48 417.27 B: find it sort of you know interesting the way that watching a car wreck is interesting [laughter] 

416.39 419.02 A: yeah that's very true though 

418.72 422.97 B: you know look at the horrible things that people can do to people through joseph conrad 

421.28 422.20 A: yeah 

422.96 424.48 A: (( yeah or even )) 

424.54 431.32 A: just exactly like you said even like you know look he loses it at traffic and you got to think at you know that's still someone's life 

431.07 432.01 B: right 

432.35 435.14 A: and that's still something that happened to somebody 

435.72 437.33 A: just you know i mean 

437.49 439.03 B: but i wonder if it kind of 

439.23 448.76 B: distances people from the actual you know fr- fr- from what really went on like if we're watching it on t._v. then it's kind of like watching a story 

449.05 450.91 B: something that really didn't happen 

450.85 455.70 A: oh yeah i was i mean in a lot of ways it's like a daily sit com or daily you know 

455.35 456.21 B: [laughter] 

456.43 459.08 B: in a really sick and twisted kind of way 

458.76 463.77 A: yeah it it well it is you get to find out oh this is what happened today and 

463.99 471.81 A: yeah you know the other recent one that was on there now that i'm thinking about it is that david westerfield from san diego that killed the little girl um 

472.39 475.72 A: out here in san diego oh gosh what was her name 

475.89 477.77 A: van dam danielle van dam 

478.20 479.78 B: i don't think i remember that one 

480.56 483.85 A: yeah that one was on t._v. i don't know if it was on t._v. everywhere 

483.94 488.29 A: but at least out here because it's so close it was major news 

487.77 493.00 B: right i wonder if they're going to do anything with the guy that kidnapped that little girl in utah 

492.56 501.42 A: the smart girl i'm curious to see what happens you know because it happened so close to when the war started it has i think it kind of got put on the back burner 

493.64 494.61 B: yeah 

501.30 502.47 B: that's true 

502.44 505.49 A: i think if all this hadn't been going on it probably wouldn't have 

505.58 507.69 A: been put so much on the back burner 

508.21 512.65 A: i'm i'm very curious about it 'cause he seems like a very strange man 

512.61 525.88 B: oh i know it's bizarre and like just and the fact that he managed to drag her up into the hills and like she didn't res- you know and he somehow managed to make her not respond when people were calling for her and she could hear them 

518.94 519.94 A: yeah 

525.83 532.39 A: yeah well from what i understand from when i at least heard on the news of course and read in the paper she 

532.61 541.06 A: she was his wife supposedly they had you know these listed vows and that was it [laughter] she was led to believe she was his wife 

541.61 548.48 B: that's just so weird i could i could i could just never imagine being in a situation like that even if i were the kid i mean 

547.87 549.53 A: i know exactly 

548.93 551.53 B: i would do like anything i could to escape 

550.80 554.10 A: exactly and at fifteen years old you're old enough to 

554.25 555.32 A: you know 

555.41 558.72 A: you're walking all over the place you run in somewhere 

558.49 561.01 B: right right exactly that 

560.31 564.86 A: yeah i i i don't understand how that happened either but 

565.14 567.24 A: i'm very curious to see what 

566.62 567.52 B: (( one )) 

567.97 571.79 B: will probably end up being a good candidate to 

571.84 575.07 B: end up on television just because it was so bizarre 

574.85 576.22 A: very much so 

576.24 578.88 A: i i mean it is very bizarre 

580.23 585.39 B: i wonder if people you know [cough] are watching these things to try and like 

586.16 591.33 B: understand for themselves the motivation for what makes people commit crimes or something i mean 

592.14 597.40 A: you know i i don't understand the reasoning for having the trial on t._v. first i mean i just 

597.68 599.89 A: it's not entertainment value and the kind of thing
