12.71 14.20 B: so what do you think about smoking 

14.87 15.76 A: smoking well 

16.20 19.19 A: um in terms of the question that should it be banned 

19.58 21.09 A: um in public places 

21.49 22.02 B: mhm 

21.87 22.31 A: i think 

22.44 23.96 A: i i do agree i think so 

24.98 25.43 B: why 

25.97 27.71 A: why because um 

28.72 29.26 A: uh 

29.57 32.88 A: in the danger of secondhand smoke are great enough that 

33.58 34.34 A: that it's not 

34.46 35.86 A: it's not safe to have it 

36.11 36.82 A: around 

36.92 37.77 A: especially when like 

38.38 40.36 A: a vast majority of people don't smoke 

40.61 41.02 A: so 

41.16 42.34 A: you know a minority 

42.83 43.13 A: would 

43.35 43.93 A: be 

44.06 44.82 A: causing 

45.12 48.47 A: you know possible health problems for a majority and that's not very fair 

49.40 50.03 B: well 

50.70 52.21 B: suppose it depends what you call a public 

55.19 55.52 A: right 

55.42 57.94 B: the the um 

58.48 60.76 B: the dangers of secondhand smoke have hardly been 

60.95 61.42 B: proven 

71.66 72.00 A: true 

78.00 78.94 A: well i mean 

79.83 80.96 A: the i agree but 

81.39 81.91 A: um 

82.60 86.48 A: you know there's some things you can do and some things you can't obviously they're trying to 

86.83 90.36 A: control uh car exhaust also but there's a limit you can't 

90.82 94.30 A: you can't have a society function without automobiles at this point 

94.68 97.73 A: but you know every step can do to make 

98.20 100.91 A: society a safer healthier place should be taken 

101.44 103.61 A: at the you know at at the cost of 

103.98 105.95 A: leaving a min- minority of people 

106.22 107.84 A: in slight discomfort 

108.33 109.86 A: you know you can prevent a lot of 

110.07 110.62 A: (( )) 

111.63 113.28 B: well what would you consider a public 

114.47 116.51 A: um any place where 

117.24 119.60 A: any place outside of the private sector where 

120.14 120.86 A: where um 

121.46 121.74 A: like 

121.89 122.90 A: where people 

123.11 124.07 A: live 

124.27 124.88 A: together 

125.26 126.50 A: people work together 

128.32 129.54 A: any any place like that 

130.14 134.57 B: so you're calling inside buildings public places what about outside buildings 

135.10 138.54 A: outside within a certain range of the outside building 

138.75 143.24 A: ou- out within certain range outside a public building i would also consider that public 

144.76 145.85 B: what kind of range 

146.12 147.71 B: cause now you're talking about 

147.83 149.47 B: banning somebody's right to 

150.77 151.79 B: smoke in the 

153.14 153.58 B: really 

154.15 158.75 A: well i i think uh you know experimentally scientifically it can be determined how 

159.12 161.41 A: how far a safe range is that 

161.60 165.04 B: well they haven't even experimentally established 

161.84 162.45 A: somewhat 

165.14 167.62 B: um that secondhand smoke is actually dangerous 

167.95 170.04 B: just that some people who do not smoke 

186.99 189.37 A: that's true but um i think that 

190.01 190.42 A: studies 

190.81 194.72 A: then studies if they haven't concluded on anything yet then they shouldn't be done 

195.19 196.68 A: it seems logical that 

196.95 198.62 A: secondhand smoke would cause 

199.31 200.12 A: uh a lot of 

200.50 200.98 A: uh 

201.11 203.48 A: health concerns similar to those of smoking 

203.91 206.28 A: given that you know the the 

206.39 207.00 A: smoke 

207.32 209.44 A: being exhaled by smokers and 

209.78 211.48 A: uh consequently inhaled by 

211.85 213.87 A: non smokers is is is the same 

214.53 215.01 A: so 

214.54 216.79 B: oh j- don't you think that non smokers should just 

216.92 217.99 B: stay away from the place 

220.02 220.42 A: well 

220.55 222.14 A: i mean is that fair that 

222.43 224.87 A: a majority of people would have to stay away from 

225.14 227.37 A: people just because they choose to 

226.49 226.93 B: is it 

227.09 228.30 B: fair that one 

233.76 237.64 A: it's not it's not just an imposition of will it's a matter of 

238.04 238.57 A: um 

239.11 240.56 A: if if both people 

240.81 244.08 A: if both people can't you know be living in comfort 

244.28 246.37 A: at the same place at the same time then 

246.84 247.40 A: then the 

247.71 248.71 A: people who 

249.22 249.71 A: um 

250.06 252.74 A: have the greatest voice the people who um 

252.92 254.31 A: have the greatest number should 

254.74 257.80 A: uh you know democratically be allowed to 

258.27 259.80 A: not necessarily dictate 

260.11 262.52 A: uh new something different but you know 

262.90 267.29 A: the their view has a little bit more weight er substantial bit more weight 

267.77 269.11 A: as a result of their 

269.26 271.00 A: um more num- greater numbers 

271.96 272.60 B: but that 

288.91 289.64 A: well um 

289.86 293.88 A: well i mean logically speaking uh obviously logic has to be taken into 

294.01 295.02 A: into account also 

311.19 311.48 A: uh 

323.96 324.28 A: uh huh 

335.64 338.48 B: there's just this thing uh been decided 

338.64 341.63 B: arbitrarily that uh it's a public 

342.76 343.21 B: so 

358.96 359.68 B: so 

366.50 371.54 B: the patrons and the establishments um will say okay well you can't smoke 

372.08 373.49 A: well well i guess i 

373.69 377.40 A: then i'd have to change my opinion to some extent in a place where 

377.80 379.36 A: if if if it is true that 

379.63 380.90 A: a majority of the 

381.00 381.71 A: people that 

382.13 386.19 A: um go to you know such bars and restaurants are people that smoke 

386.56 387.56 A: if a majority 

387.89 389.03 A: that you know if it's 

389.26 390.90 A: if it's proven that a majority 

391.36 395.20 A: of the customers are smokers then then yes i agree that 

395.58 397.68 A: then that it shouldn't um 

397.98 399.79 A: fall under the same jurisdiction but 

400.28 402.70 A: i don't believe that many places 

403.24 404.09 A: uh would 

404.27 406.79 A: fall under that category because of the 

407.01 407.83 A: you know the huge 

408.24 409.57 A: differences in the number of 

409.83 412.34 A: smokers versus non smokers there are so many more 

412.65 413.67 A: non smokers 

414.11 414.60 A: that 

415.24 415.82 A: um 

416.44 418.78 A: that it's it's rare that that occurs 

419.21 421.58 A: that a you know a place of business 

422.11 423.98 A: a public place of business would 

424.37 424.98 A: have 

425.24 428.39 A: greater number of non smokers than smokers and therefore 

428.74 430.06 A: because of the fact that 

430.48 432.69 A: it's it's a potentially possible that 

432.99 433.89 A: non smokers 

434.02 434.56 A: can 

434.71 437.65 A: be injured the habit of smokers 

438.09 439.28 A: in those places 

439.55 441.04 A: that they should not be 

441.59 445.38 A: they should not have to subject themselves to possible harm just for 

445.80 447.41 A: wanting to go to the same place 

447.38 449.48 B: that's if you're going to legislate against 

448.02 448.70 A: (( )) 

449.61 451.61 B: possible harm um 

452.12 456.78 B: you know then nobody would be allowed to do anything especially drive cars for example 

455.28 458.16 A: i i i'm just saying i'm just saying possible harm because 

458.53 459.89 A: uh you mentioned that 

459.72 460.87 B: it's not proven 

460.12 463.25 A: it hasn't been scientifically proven that secondhand smoke 

462.42 462.98 B: mhm 

463.71 465.89 A: does but i i also have heard 

466.17 468.07 A: studies that say the opposite 

468.47 469.18 A: so i guess 

469.58 470.04 A: you know 

470.21 471.94 A: more study is needed on that topic 

472.26 473.09 B: i agree with you 

473.28 475.08 B: i (( )) agree with you do you smoke 

475.56 476.19 A: no i do not 

478.02 478.76 A: right 

480.73 481.48 A: right right 

482.56 483.24 A: i understand 

491.10 492.40 B: allow smoking 

492.84 498.36 B: non smokers have a choice of staying out (( )) going to other places where there are not don't you think 

493.09 493.39 A: uh 

497.93 503.46 A: right but at the same time if uh bars ban smoking non smokers i mean smokers have the choice of 

503.77 505.01 A: you know being there or not 

503.96 504.79 B: staying home 

505.19 505.79 A: exactly 

505.93 507.64 B: well that's why should they 

508.39 509.82 A: but wh- why should uh 

508.99 514.27 B: why should then when the bar owners themselves do not require that 

514.62 521.86 B: and it's the local government in the place that i'm actually living that is imposing that rule it's not people 

514.82 515.09 A: well
