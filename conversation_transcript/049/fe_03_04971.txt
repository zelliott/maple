122.70 126.05 A: um but not not really even so much in the wintertime 

125.52 138.07 B: yeah it's tougher during the wintertime you know because i mean there's especially there's so many holidays during the winter you know it's just difficult to get motivated when they're like expected to be somewhere every single weekend and you're out shopping and stuff 

130.97 131.86 A: (( mhm )) 

135.90 141.88 A: sure now now now do do you live in a climate where i mean the wintertime's not a problem that you can't get out or

143.09 143.99 A: okay 

143.82 148.34 B: yeah it's kinda tough [laughter] especially since i don't ski so that's not a good thing 

147.12 148.07 A: sure 

148.14 150.69 A: well you live in new england and you don't ski

150.86 153.99 A: (( you're the one okay [laughter] )) 

155.99 160.00 A: now now you're not originally from there because you don't have any kind of new england accent at all 

156.27 157.02 B: [laughter] 

159.40 160.54 B: really 

160.32 161.46 A: really 

161.04 161.68 B: (( huh )) 

161.85 165.13 B: okay i'll have to work on that then huh i don't know 

163.45 170.23 A: [laughter] that's it it was kind of funny i mean some some of the snowstor- i i'm in pennsylvania 

169.45 170.71 B: (( [laughter] oh okay )) 

170.02 179.58 A: and some of the snowstorms we had this past winter i was kind of thinking i i've just i've just pushed over forty now so i'm i'm officially middle aged for the last five months 

178.87 179.92 B: okay 

179.37 194.17 A: um but we had uh you know the one big snowstorm that we had we talk about being in shape and working out and what have you uh i kinda imagined myself no i'm still in fairly reasonable shape but uh i imagined myself as one of these statistics that was going to fall over uh shoveling snow 

193.75 195.15 B: [laughter] 

194.27 199.59 A: i've got a lot of we we we live in a fairly mature neighborhood for lack of a better word 

199.31 199.92 B: (( yeah )) 

199.64 210.03 A: and uh i went out and shoveled my driveway when we had the big snowstorm work worked out pretty good uh i don't have a snow blower and uh saw one of my neighbors helping out a second neighbor 

203.49 204.30 B: (( yeah )) 

206.25 207.05 B: okay 

209.94 210.81 B: oh 

210.10 214.48 A: and it just kinda the chain reaction i wound up shoveling out seven driveways that day 

213.70 217.49 B: [laughter] oh my god i definitely could not do that [laughter] 

217.13 219.32 A: i was sore for about three days 

218.73 221.62 B: i can imagine yes definitely 

220.56 225.38 A: what what i found though is like for instance i playing softball 

225.64 230.59 A: uh you know you got a certain if i'm pitching or if i'm playing the infield i've got a certain 

230.41 243.62 A: muscle group that i'm working out we had uh our catcher didn't show up the game that we played last week so i wound up catching well that squatting behind the plate it's co- completely different muscle set and the same thing for about two days afterwards my uh 

232.10 232.91 B: yeah 

235.14 235.95 B: okay 

243.62 253.33 A: you know my shins my thighs all those leg muscles normally they don't get a pretty good workout um and i think that's why i like it you know they they have like you've heard the saying no no pain no gain 

245.02 245.79 B: (( yeah )) 

247.93 248.69 B: (( yeah )) 

252.96 254.31 B: exactly 

253.74 257.81 A: i just don't like pain [laughter] 

255.18 256.07 B: [laughter] 

257.32 258.40 B: (( not a good thing )) 

258.93 263.10 B: (( no i know it well it's tough 'cause i tried what was it pilates )) 

263.03 264.31 A: mhm 

263.50 272.90 B: and the thing was dazzling but they worked muscles that i just did not even know i had it was [laughter] it was unbelievable i'm like i didn't even know there was a muscle there so 

270.14 271.27 A: mhm 

273.86 274.85 B: (( it was un- )) 

274.11 277.23 A: now do you have kids are they involved in any sports and activities 

276.96 279.62 B: um no kids so thankfully 

278.10 278.92 A: okay 

279.64 281.28 A: [laughter] 

279.76 282.47 B: no [laughter] don't have to be doing carpooling no 

281.99 283.29 A: right 

282.56 289.38 B: but i think that might i don't know i don't know that would be more helpful you know to get the kids out there be out there with the kids and everything 

288.11 296.50 A: well it i mean it it makes it more difficult sometimes uh i have two kids that are older and out of school now but uh my youngest is still 

296.39 306.22 A: [cough] she'll be starting high school next year and what you find is you start to get involved with taking time away from yourself in i i've coached a lot of my kids' teams 

305.92 306.76 B: okay 

306.10 312.99 A: uh i kind i i'm kind of the guy who says you know uh if you can't find anybody else to coach go ahead and call me 

312.26 313.13 B: (( okay yeah )) 

313.24 321.99 A: and at that point my wife looks at me and says you realise as soon as you say that they stop looking right [laughter] because they've just found me i mean why why look for anybody else okay 

313.30 314.91 B: and they always do [laughter] 

317.57 318.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

318.64 319.91 B: (( exactly )) 

321.94 322.79 B: [laughter] 

322.14 323.75 A: great we've got a coach

325.27 329.77 A: wind up and you know the you you kinda try to keep involved with uh 

330.05 338.15 A: you know you keep up with what the kids are doing you send them out to run laps maybe uh maybe you take one lap around the field and you send them out for three but um 

336.04 336.73 B: (( yeah )) 

338.25 341.84 A: i like to think that i'm not grossly out of shape but i could do much better 

341.32 348.20 B: yeah i think we all can 'cause like what is it like sixty percent of the u._s. is overweight now or something 

341.95 342.78 A: [laughter] 

347.74 349.17 A: is that right 

348.43 352.09 B: i think so it's it's i heard it on oprah it's kind of disturbing 

351.02 351.80 A: (( oh )) 

352.51 354.79 A: for for for all the people to talk about all right 

354.31 355.26 B: [laughter] 

355.00 358.13 A: [laughter] but i'm a i 

356.63 358.36 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

358.43 366.76 A: i they say that the exercise equipment industry is one of the you know largest or fastest growing industries in this country

397.02 398.35 B: (( for the summer [laughter] )) 

398.42 406.57 A: i i thought about if if somebody hasn't invented this i think they could make a lot of money off it and whoever these calls is probably going take my idea run with it and become a millionaire 

404.63 405.56 B: [laughter] 

406.50 407.75 B: [laughter] quite yeah 

407.06 409.49 A: i think what they ought to have is a stationary bike 

409.56 414.88 A: hooked up to a generator to a t._v. so if you want to watch t._v. you gotta be pedaling the bike 

411.66 413.02 B: [sigh] that 

414.25 415.96 B: (( yep definitely )) 

414.90 417.66 A: you quit pedaling the bike the t._v. goes off 

417.10 418.03 B: [laughter] 

417.84 420.82 A: america would not have an obesity problem with their kids 

420.38 421.71 B: exactly 

421.10 426.62 A: talk about kids watching too much t._v. that's great watch all the t._v. you want but you have to work for the electricity to make it go 

426.68 429.60 B: that would be a very good idea i think we should try that 

429.09 429.88 A: i 

432.99 437.31 A: but like i said un- undoubtedly i'll see it on i'll see it uh around 

438.33 440.83 A: roncker will be selling them next year on t._v. 

439.49 440.47 B: [laughter] 

440.66 441.51 B: (( i know )) 

440.84 441.88 A: [laughter] 

442.00 447.60 B: amazing how much how many like you know ab things they have out there every three minutes there's one 

445.83 446.67 A: sure 

447.85 458.48 A: and they and they i mean they all like they're all very gimmicky uh you know and you're right i mean the no pain no gain thing if it you know if it if it's not working i don't think it's going to work for you 

451.56 452.68 B: (( i know )) 

458.24 464.99 B: exactly well like what was it the thigh master i couldn't i could not resist buying the thigh master i bought

477.17 478.06 A: right 

477.40 482.49 B: so i'm like how do they expect that to even do anything if it you don't even feel it doing something 

482.53 493.06 A: the first piece of exercise equipment i ever that that i remember being cognizant of and this probably goes back thirty years it was this string on a pulley that you attached to a doorknob 

492.66 493.52 B: yes 

493.42 499.65 A: you remember that you laid on the floor in front of it and you would pull your leg i mean pull the string down and your leg would go up in the air 

494.06 494.96 B: [laughter] 

499.29 500.56 B: yep [laughter] 

499.97 506.06 A: and i remember them just sell i mean they sold more of those than they did slim whitman albums i think it was um

529.24 530.41 B: (( forced exercise )) 

531.91 540.61 A: may may maybe it's a different we kinda live a little out in a more rural area i guess the kids are maybe i don't know if they're working on the farms but they must be more involved because i don't see the real 

540.71 548.72 A: you know obesity in kids that you hear about i mean i'm looking here and there's there there there might be a couple three of them but they they they all seem to be in pretty good shape 

542.67 543.64 B: (( [sigh] yeah okay )) 

548.91 554.34 A: of course they're still fourteen so let them get out of high school and get lazy maybe things'll change 

552.19 553.96 B: (( [mn] exactly )) 

554.37 555.30 A: [laughter] 

555.36 560.45 B: exactly yeah they don't have to walk between classes you know at college anymore and stuff like that 

560.46 569.15 A: and and maybe that's what it was with me too i know when i was going to school i had our three schools were all in our neighborhoods elementary junior high high school i just i mean i never rode a school bus to school 

568.93 571.04 B: yep i think that makes a difference 

569.85 570.51 A: so 

571.63 577.62 A: and and of course i walked you know both ways uphill in the snow up to my you know snow up to my chest
