48.18 52.32 B: so i didn't even understand the ah the topic of the day did you hear it 

51.97 64.11 A: i [mn] i heard first i heard censorship and then i heard ah today's topic is something about public schools it was i think ah should public schools 

63.52 66.67 B: do something about books kids read 

64.91 67.78 A: be allowed to censor certain books 

67.95 72.48 B: oh censor books yeah i think they should what do you think 

70.01 70.94 A: yeah 

72.14 76.37 A: i think they should too i i mean i always heard about that ah 

76.43 78.89 A: that hitler book being censored 

79.08 80.56 A: (( mein kampf )) 

79.29 80.00 B: (( mm )) 

80.93 82.24 B: oh the new one 

81.91 88.02 A: no no this is way old he he wrote this i guess when he was during his rise to power he wrote 

87.13 88.20 B: okay 

88.07 89.73 A: a little book um 

89.76 101.24 A: and i i suppose that you know they were they were censored first in germany and then censored is all schools but that was always the running joke that that mein kampf was among the books that are 

101.17 105.64 A: that were censored but i don't i don't think the kids should be reading certain books 

101.31 101.92 B: (( [mn] )) 

105.37 113.51 B: yeah i guess they i guess they would think that's like an infringement but look how they're infringing on all the other rights what the hey 

113.27 114.27 A: yeah 

113.90 118.72 B: you know if it's something that gonna make things safer or our worlds a little safer 

118.90 122.26 B: you know as far as kids minds are concerned 

122.33 129.24 B: i think it should be censored because um right now they can just bust into your home without even a warrant 

129.38 130.83 B: and it's okay 

131.09 132.96 B: you know and if 

133.07 135.10 B: really they 

134.19 140.00 A: they c they can bust into your home without a warrant i thought that was one of the second amendments search and seizure 

139.83 142.86 B: no they changed that for new york city 

142.53 143.53 A: really 

143.00 146.21 B: yeah giuliani changed that 

143.89 144.94 A: oh no 

146.89 154.42 B: [noise] the police they can basically they have ah wide broader powers since the nine one one incident 

153.91 157.64 A: [mn] oh okay well yeah that's that's understandable 

155.39 156.98 B: mhm 

157.39 164.14 B: yeah all these crazy broader powers they are actually just snatching up our rights 

164.18 174.93 A: but it's it's strange because if you censor a book i i think that i definitely think that certain books should be censored because the teachers and ah the administrators 

174.87 186.24 A: they can use their better judgement and say okay you know what this this isn't appropriate for the curriculum and i think this would you know lead kids to maybe emulate something in the book or ah 

184.46 185.31 B: (( right )) 

186.21 194.45 A: you know give them bad ideas so i think certain books should be censored but then the trouble is if you censor it they wanna read it more 

195.30 202.01 A: you know just like if you tell the kid ah you can't play video games you know he wants to play video games 

202.03 204.40 A: it's it's like reverse psychology 

203.66 205.76 B: it comes down to parents too 

205.76 207.07 A: yeah 

206.74 207.95 B: you know 

208.41 214.06 B: um i don't know parents just they don't really deal with their kids [laughter] 

214.33 225.69 B: from what i see you know they just allow their kids to do what they want they ask then what they want you know you have to discipline a child you can't always ask what to they want 

225.63 229.57 A: 'cause they don't know they don't know what's good for them in the greater scheme of things 

227.55 228.93 B: (( right )) 

229.50 232.37 B: right and i see that a lot you know 

232.59 236.74 B: it's like well how do you want to do this and i'm like listen 

236.84 240.13 B: you're supposed to guide that kid and tell him how to do it you know 

240.30 248.79 B: or how what do you want what do you want to do about this and i don't know but censorship in schools i think 

248.83 250.13 B: why not 

250.74 252.98 A: yeah i agree i think that ah 

253.07 257.93 A: the the question was should should they be allowed to censor certain books 

258.12 261.07 A: and i think definitely they should be allowed to i mean [mn] 

261.13 263.63 A: the kids won't even know that it's censored i 

263.99 270.26 A: mean they they they just get their textbooks history math science 

266.46 267.53 B: right 

269.76 273.77 B: so i guess that means they'll be checking book bags i doubt it 

273.63 276.12 A: no no well i don't i don't think ah 

276.40 286.22 A: i don't think it'll even get to that because if it were censored [mn] i thought they meant ah censored in terms of the regular curriculum like if a if a teacher wants to be 

286.09 292.01 A: you know crazy and and let's say let's say it's a history teacher and the history teacher assigns 

292.14 296.81 A: that hitler book for the curriculum it should be allowed to be censored because 

293.02 294.40 B: yeah 

294.65 295.88 B: okay 

296.84 309.53 A: if it were censored the kids would never even know it existed 'cause kids really don't read on their own at that age um they you know they would read for pleasure and even if they read for pleasure it's not part of the curriculum anyway so then 

301.97 303.20 B: true 

309.53 314.05 A: so i think i guess that's where where i stand if it's if it's on their own 

314.16 322.23 A: if their reading on their own then it shouldn't be censored but if it's a school part of the school curriculum then books should be allowed to be censored [laughter] 

320.01 321.73 B: oh definitely 

321.80 326.53 B: definitely and you are so right i just i agree with you so much 

326.54 333.65 B: you are so right you know and um you're right [laughter] i totally agree 

333.54 339.50 A: still i guess i i wish i had know ah i wish the ah recording had told us what kinds of books 

339.84 345.37 A: were censored because that's the only one i can think of i mean that was always just a running joke 

339.84 340.85 B: (( [laughter] hm )) 

345.69 349.22 A: that that book it it was like his memoirs 

346.86 350.20 B: i wonder why they even thought of censoring 

350.73 351.78 B: um 

351.26 352.70 A: oh books 

352.09 355.63 B: yeah is is something going on right now 

355.84 363.20 A: ah i don't know i really don't know i'm really i'm desperately trying to think of other books that were censored 

363.62 364.99 A: (( ah )) 

365.05 366.76 A: something [mn] was there 

367.06 370.03 A: carnal knowledge was that a movie or a book 

370.06 372.41 A: that was a that was in the seventies though 

370.29 371.68 B: sounds like a 

372.54 373.90 A: that was ah 

373.53 374.44 B: (( [mn] )) 

373.96 377.47 A: i'm trying to think of what what else was censored but 

377.71 382.49 A: i don't know i i just don't think that it would even make it to the to the kids' minds you 

382.65 383.73 B: right 

382.72 385.76 A: know i really don't think that kids are out there looking 

385.30 389.45 B: (( for for controversial books to read [laughter] )) 

385.87 388.34 A: for books that are censored yeah 

388.52 391.36 A: especially at that age they just think about playing 

390.94 397.78 B: or or or novels regular novels the those steam ah jackie collins type novels 

392.51 393.59 A: yeah 

393.75 395.02 A: exactly 

397.04 398.31 A: yeah 

398.06 400.89 B: ah and the boys look at playgirl or whatever 

400.63 405.18 A: ri- well yeah boys look at playboy and girls look at playgirl 

403.47 404.68 B: playboy 

404.95 406.31 B: okay 

405.31 410.69 A: although sometimes it's the opposite hm 

407.82 409.77 B: okay 

410.05 416.68 B: [laughter] true so ah [lipsmack] i don't know i mean what can i say you've said it all [laughter] 

416.90 418.89 B: you totally said it all 

419.03 420.37 A: well i guess ah 

419.12 422.30 B: yeah you've been in you grew up in new jersey 

421.88 425.51 A: yeah yeah i lived bergen new jersey my whole life 

425.06 427.31 B: oh okay yeah lived any 

425.86 428.23 A: just moved to cliffside park last year 

427.84 434.59 B: i i looked for a jobs out there i was in east orange too i stayed in east orange for eight years 

433.38 437.23 A: and in my high school i don't think there were any books that were censored 

437.81 440.85 B: mhm no i'd never even heard of it 

438.00 444.80 A: i mean well that's that's just the point i mean if there were any books that were censored i certainly didn't know about it because they were censored 

444.97 451.83 A: and i wouldn't i wasn't going out and looking for books that were censored to bring it in and say hey look can we read this in class 

451.03 452.61 B: exactly [laughter] 

453.14 460.37 B: exactly students aren't even thinking like that they were basically trying to get away from the books that they have to read now as it is 

455.91 456.79 A: yeah 

459.14 464.53 A: exactly exactly i remember that every single book i ever got was boring 

463.97 466.85 B: (( boring oh blah i gotta do this )) 

464.79 471.49 A: and i would never read it on my own i think the only one i read on my own was the catcher in the rye 

471.44 480.25 A: and that was because i you know a teacher had recommended it to me but i see i always thought that the books were better when they weren't assignments 

475.45 476.49 B: mhm 

480.51 481.79 B: mhm 

480.54 491.23 A: you know if if you didn't have to read chapter one and write a journal entry about chapter one you know you just got through it but you can you could read it before going to bed or something or 

484.69 485.78 B: [laughter] 

491.50 496.01 A: you know you could read it on the bus and it was a- i think i retained it better 

495.88 500.89 B: (( and do you know why you can't you can't leave it up to kids i don't know )) 

501.71 502.81 B: (( i don't know )) 

503.30 511.40 B: that decision if you give them controversial i guess in a way that teachers are trying to probably give them controversial thinking 

511.62 512.85 A: yeah 

512.54 515.77 B: trying to make them look at controversial thinking 

515.78 518.26 B: and maybe be able to analyze it 

518.94 520.02 A: i see 

520.17 534.08 A: but they but they're too young to to be able to understand see kids kids think in the short term they they don't know that if they eat candy and don't brush their teeth their teeth'll fall out ten years from now 

533.53 535.49 B: but they say start them early 

535.08 547.25 A: they just se- yeah they just see the short term i want candy now i want to go out with my friends now i wanna you know they so i i don't even know that they would 

547.30 548.74 A: see that far 

549.53 550.38 B: (( hm )) 

551.54 556.18 A: you know i don't even think that like i said i don't think that they would go out and 

555.14 564.70 B: i don't know you got a lot of crazy kids out there high school students and junior high school students it's sad they've they freaking um you know gone 

557.96 559.15 A: [laughter] 

560.90 561.97 A: that's true 

565.53 567.38 B: they're gone and it is 

566.17 572.55 A: well i i think that well i know a friend of mine ah got in trouble for wearing 

572.58 574.76 A: a nirvana tee shirt 

574.83 575.91 B: really 

575.27 583.50 A: yeah he he wore a tee shirt that said nirvana i think it was the one with ah it has all the organs on the front 

583.15 584.02 B: oh 

583.61 586.79 A: ah like a it's just like a like a human being but instead of 

586.94 598.61 A: showing the skin it shows the heart and the liver and the kidneys and all the organs so he got in trouble for ah for wearing that and that's censorship 'cause he had to go home and change his clothes 

594.62 595.44 B: uh-huh 

596.63 599.00 B: right that is that is 

599.08 599.89 A: but
