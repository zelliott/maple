253.96 255.12 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

259.80 268.88 A: [noise] right no i i understand that i mean not everybody can do the same thing some people don't have the the muscle power to do bicycling 

268.44 269.34 B: right 

268.92 272.61 A: and so they do other things like maybe step aerobics or 

272.05 272.89 B: uh-huh 

272.83 281.45 A: but uh it's good to have a a balance between exercise and eating and [noise] and vitamins and definitely taking the supplements 

277.73 278.54 B: uh-huh 

281.72 286.23 B: yes yes i i hear one of your animals in the background 

285.87 289.98 A: yes that's the cat he's very annoyed because i'm not paying attention to him 

289.51 296.71 B: oh isn't that isn't that the truth when you're on the they're like they're like children really when you're on the phone and you're not paying attention 

293.69 295.09 A: oh yes [noise] 

296.94 309.07 B: yes in fact i i just came in from outside and uh there was a notice in the mailbox someone in the neighborhood has lost their ferret and i felt so badly for 'em because i don't know what their chances are of finding a ferret 

309.00 316.80 A: well possibly better than just finding an average cat or dog i mean it would be difficult to spot but it would be unique 

316.81 318.85 A: 'cause not everybody would have one 

317.56 319.75 B: i wonder if it would go far 

319.83 320.99 A: [sigh] um 

319.91 322.87 B: wander off further i don't know 

321.98 329.87 A: i'm not sure i i don't have any experience i don't know if they're like cats and dogs that kind of home in where home is and kind of stick around 

328.27 329.22 B: (( yeah )) 

329.29 330.53 B: i wonder 

331.08 334.02 A: but one can hope that they'll find it [noise]

338.23 340.64 A: um 

341.51 354.31 A: uh i don't believe in a lot of the exercise uh gurus the ones out there that advocate just this type or just that type or the 

353.25 362.36 B: no i think as you say i think walking is as perfect an exercise as you i really believe that walking and swimming and i think you're perfect 

357.24 358.22 A: mhm 

362.59 364.58 A: oh it it's great with

445.80 447.25 B: yes i know 

446.87 451.90 A: i don't mind planting the yard but i don't necessarily want to do it if it's raining hard [laughter] [noise] 

452.12 454.55 B: no not if it's raining hard 

452.37 453.20 A: but let 

453.93 458.35 A: but let's see we'll get back on topic [laughter] here or try to uh 

456.08 457.00 B: okay 

457.32 459.16 B: what about exercise 

458.87 462.79 A: about exercise um [noise] the um 

462.42 467.08 B: when do you feel is the best time to exercise morning 

467.01 472.02 A: for me the the the best time to exercise 

470.93 472.89 B: when you're least tired 

473.18 485.69 A: well it it's hard for me because most of my walking exercise comes walking to and from work and walking at work i actually walk probably five to ten miles a day doing that easily 

480.71 481.65 B: uh-huh 

484.99 487.35 B: well that's won- now uh 

487.46 489.41 B: you walk rain or shine 

489.15 490.80 A: [sigh] i walk rain or shine 

490.80 504.96 A: the only time i don't walk is if i'm going to be sent out of the area say for tomorrow if they're going to send me to elmira new york or something like that [sigh] then i would take our vehicle and just so i have it there to go 

495.67 496.58 B: uh-huh 

499.06 500.58 B: uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 

504.77 519.10 A: but i would still be doing all the walking in and around elmira and whatever i had to do there i also do lifting of boxes and uh some other stuff so i do get some exercise even if i don't get to walk as much as i like 

509.76 510.66 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

519.44 521.93 B: but you must keep yourself very trim then 

521.64 525.65 A: i'm well not as trim as i'd like because 

524.64 528.63 B: well i mean you do you know five miles a day that's great 

528.03 530.70 A: right [noise] but i it 

529.79 532.12 B: and i imagine you walk briskly 

531.41 545.10 A: [noise] i walk briskly sometimes more briskly than others if it's really cold but it [noise] it i'm one of those where i'm not really overweight but i have more weight than i'd like but my system doesn't want to let go of it [noise] 

534.93 535.77 B: uh-huh 

545.03 553.19 A: it's like a plateau [noise] that it's reached it says michael you're not really ideal weight but i'm not going to let go of this you're going to keep this 

545.65 546.47 B: yes 

547.08 547.99 B: yes 

551.86 556.71 B: yes yes i i know what you mean there your body seems to say 

554.58 567.93 A: but i'm i'm happy i'm keeping fit i had uh i had my cholesterol checked the other day and both good and bad were down the doctor was very very pleased with my cholesterol count 

567.76 571.25 B: and you you're not on anything that you've done that naturally 

569.63 577.44 A: i'm i'm not on anything uh the only thing i think that affects the cholesterol that i have that i intake is garlic 

578.06 578.74 B: you 

579.56 581.79 B: does garlic affect cholesterol 

581.73 589.98 A: evidently i've i've heard some stuff that says [noise] that garlic is supposedly very good for you it has an effect on the cholesterol level 

584.54 585.55 B: (( have you )) 

588.13 589.22 B: right 

590.06 597.42 A: uh and because i like garlic a lot uh i eat garlic in sauces i eat 

597.25 598.04 B: uh-huh 

597.69 599.89 A: uh in just about everything we 

599.21 599.89 B: have you ever
