55.76 65.61 A: well by as far as doing things i've um couple of days ago just before memorial day i i built a little biddy miniature temporary deck out of our backdoor 

65.01 66.31 B: (( oh yeah ))

70.46 84.18 A: and wanted to have folks and we just got off sewer and um or got off septic in february so that the septic tank was right outside the backdoor so we have this just mass of dirt and i thought let's get rid of that [laughter] 

79.47 80.60 B: [laughter] 

83.69 88.98 B: [laughter] i hear ya we got like a ton of leaves out here that really need to be raked

104.78 107.15 B: how far are you from beaumont uh-huh uh [mn] 

104.82 106.18 A: and let's see 

107.04 113.71 A: beaumont is uh near the border of louisiana it would three four 

114.17 119.33 A: maybe four and a half five hours from here it's about three hours to houston and then an hour 

119.84 122.60 A: or two to beaumont 

121.22 124.44 B: yeah i got a good friend that lives in beaumont 

123.89 124.66 A: mm 

124.75 126.20 B: but 

126.03 133.73 A: i guess the other exercise i would get is bicycle riding i do i do enjoy my bicycle though i've as years go by i i seem to ride it less but [laughter] 

133.96 139.21 B: i know i used to love to do that i used to have a raccoon that used to ride the bike with me 

138.70 142.05 A: a raccoon [laughter] you mean like on the bicycle 

139.80 141.24 B: a raccoon 

141.63 144.58 B: yeah oh yeah i mean 

142.39 145.38 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

144.69 148.72 B: back when i was a kid you know had the banana seats you know 

146.31 150.55 A: yeah oh yeah 

149.30 153.21 B: and he'd put his hind legs on the seat and his 

153.22 158.06 B: front legs would be up on the handlebars and we'd just ride all over the neighborhood 

157.62 160.32 A: was it a pet oh my 

158.57 159.44 B: yeah 

160.16 162.50 B: yeah he was a good pet too 

162.61 163.62 A: i've uh 

164.13 171.81 A: a friend of mine back when i was about seven or so had a raccoon and i i was always scared of those things 'cause he kept it in a cage and it was mean 

172.05 173.48 B: well mine 

173.49 180.65 B: um i had gotten sick the last day of ninth grade and was in the hospital for three weeks 

180.73 188.84 B: and my dad had to put him in a cage while i was in the hospital 'cause my mom wouldn't take care of him and my dad was working all the time 

188.62 189.66 A: (( mm )) 

189.22 192.87 B: and when i got out the hospital he was wild 

192.69 194.50 A: yeah 

193.09 195.26 B: that three weeks i mean 

194.63 197.73 A: yeah they'll do that 

196.53 203.38 B: oh yeah but i had him for a good couple of years and me and that raccoon had some good times [laughter] 

200.51 202.49 A: that's good 

203.55 218.28 A: yeah also behind the house we have about eighty acres of woods that's owned by the city [lipsmack] and on the other side of that is a creek that runs all the way through to downtown austin there's a a natural spring called barton springs and and they've got a a big uh swimming pool 

208.55 209.60 B: oh wow 

217.99 218.99 B: uh-huh 

218.30 227.59 A: where where the springs are so this is up this is about five miles upstream of that so sometimes we like to walk down to the to the creek 'cause there's a hike and bike trail that'll go all the way to downtown too 

227.42 229.69 B: oh i bet that's as neat as anything 

228.63 229.29 A: so 

229.53 231.57 A: that's another piece of exercise 

231.13 232.49 B: really 

232.07 232.96 A: (( but uh )) 

233.10 247.96 A: i've never gone to a gym i think lifting weights would be dumb 'cause i could do things like build a deck [laughter] you know rake the yard right or [laughter] chase the dog if it escapes [laughter] 

238.12 239.27 B: uh-huh 

239.60 241.83 B: rake the yard [laughter] 

245.25 247.80 B: definitely [laughter] 

247.89 252.08 B: i know i got a grandson i could get a lot of exercise with him 

252.54 258.30 A: do you have arthritis or or or an ailment what what what's preventing you from walking 

252.69 253.46 B: i had a 

257.92 260.34 B: i was in a wreck four years ago 

260.14 261.42 A: oh no 

261.63 264.89 B: messed up both of my legs and 

264.97 266.43 A: you didn't lose them did you 

266.47 267.48 B: pardon me 

267.05 269.13 A: i mean you still have your legs don't you 

268.56 270.60 B: yeah but [laughter] 

269.93 273.47 A: but they're not too good oh that's a shame 

270.89 272.23 B: not too good 

273.91 277.60 B: yeah so i gotta get both knees replaced but 

277.03 278.02 A: ouch 

277.89 283.11 B: you know i've started gaining weight like crazy after the wreck 'cause i couldn't walk and now they 

282.33 283.79 A: right 

283.36 287.26 B: they said well you gotta lose weight before we can do this but [laughter] 

286.61 288.32 A: yeah 

287.33 291.09 B: how are you supposed to do that if you can't walk or do anything you know 

290.50 295.13 A: [sigh] well if you can't walk you can't walk to fridge so that's one way [laughter] 

293.74 299.36 B: i know and i don't go in the kitchen but i have a husband that is constantly wanting to feed me 

299.25 301.35 A: (( i don't know that )) 

300.40 302.13 B: (( mhm )) 

301.42 303.35 A: that sounds like an error [laughter] 

303.28 308.40 B: and i keep telling him you know i don't want this i don't want it 

307.81 309.25 A: right 

308.60 311.49 B: well my job is to take care of you [laughter] 

310.99 313.10 A: (( well shoot )) 

312.54 318.03 B: and then i'd start drinking water you know 'cause i drink a lot of tea and a lot of coffee so 

317.47 318.71 A: oh okay 

318.31 325.51 B: i bought a lot of bottled water this past month and i've been drinking water he's still bringing me tea [laughter] 

324.97 328.94 A: [laughter] well if they fix your knees will you be able to get up and about again 

328.96 330.54 B: (( i hope so )) 

330.68 331.70 A: wow 

331.24 333.27 B: i really do because i really 

332.61 336.17 A: my dad got into a wreck where a drunk driver hit him and uh 

335.22 335.87 B: (( mm )) 

336.24 347.15 A: he had to give up golf and everything he was pretty active and now he's in his up upper sixties now and he's uh he can walk okay but it just hurts him every now and then but he is he has had work done on both knees 

341.53 342.45 B: (( mhm )) 

347.09 348.04 B: well 

348.09 352.90 B: i've had both of them operated on and it didn't work i mean 

349.50 350.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

353.27 362.58 B: they give me all kinds of shots all different kinds of experimental stuff and nothing would hold i mean it just nothing would work 

357.77 358.61 A: (( hm )) 

362.52 364.32 A: yeah 

363.19 368.56 B: i can walk like from the bedroom up to the dining room to my computer and 

369.18 371.86 B: that's it [laughter] you know sit down 

370.84 374.59 A: [laughter] well exercise is important both for body and mind i believe 

374.20 378.00 B: yeah i believe that too i really do 

379.17 380.02 B: but 

379.35 381.49 A: have you taken many of these calls 

381.49 386.01 B: this is my third one i've missed quite a few of 'em because i don't get 

384.71 386.42 A: yeah i think i missed some too 

386.12 387.07 B: huh 

386.84 389.43 A: i think i've missed some too sometimes i'll hear 

389.59 393.44 A: some trail end of a mach- of a message on the machine and then it cuts off 

391.86 393.76 B: and you same here 

394.12 395.24 B: same [laughter] 

394.39 406.09 A: but i think the first one i took i wasn't sure if there was a human on the other end 'cause [laughter] it was really weird the guy was uh maybe he just didn't have much to say but [laughter] i thought this could be a program do you know who alan turing was 

407.01 418.39 A: he was a mathematician he was an english mathematician and he helped crack the uh german code in world war two and then as soon as world war two was over they booted him out because he happened to be homosexual which is 

407.27 408.02 B: [laughter] 

411.95 412.86 B: (( oh uh-huh [laughter] )) 

418.23 424.37 A: you know too bad that was his that was just the way he was but he was enormously intelligent mathematician 

420.55 421.45 B: right 

424.28 430.17 A: and uh one of the things he devised was this thing called the turing test which is basically if it quacks like a duck 

430.08 443.34 A: and in his test you have uh two like typewriters or whatever 'cause this was in the forties when he thought of it but his basic premise was if you're communicating with something and you can and they act just like a human how can you tell it's not you 

444.15 450.41 A: know how do you know that it's a really a machine or a person on the other end you know and and his uh 

445.24 446.18 B: really 

447.81 448.97 B: that's true 

450.22 460.68 A: his test is used widely in computers and voice recognition and all sorts of stuff these days 'cause it's it's a very interesting little premise you know how do you know what is a human [laughter] 

460.05 462.26 B: well i never thought about it like that 

461.65 466.55 A: hm and i think that's part of what this study is 'cause they're they're trying to teach the machine how to talk 

466.80 469.72 A: you know how to how to understand 

466.81 469.79 B: well do we get more than three calls do you know 

469.77 470.83 A: pardon me 

470.36 473.96 B: do we get more than three calls or three calls and that's it 

473.35 485.17 A: i think this is my fifth call but i was i was hooked up with them the first time and they had some they had some complications with accepting the calls or whatnot they kinda straightened out some bugs i think this is my this is number five for me 

484.78 488.21 B: oh oh i thought it was three and that was it 

487.98 493.67 A: well maybe it is 'cause i i think i had done two on the old system so maybe maybe this is my last one who knows 

491.02 492.15 B: (( oh okay )) 

492.91 494.07 B: (( okay )) 

494.70 498.07 B: i don't know i think it's been pretty kinda interesting 

497.94 506.81 A: [sigh] yeah [mn] well after one of the other ones i was i was thinking you know this if the whole idea of this is to teach the computer how to understand conversation 

498.71 499.37 B: (( they )) 

499.50 500.24 B: (( were )) 

506.79 516.95 A: you know you and i are strangers and we've never talked before it would be really interesting to have it monitor a conversation of people that knew each other 'cause for example my best friend that i've known since i was ten 

516.84 524.53 A: and i can have enormously varied conversations that just in a in a word we can be on a totally different tangent 

519.91 521.15 B: (( mhm )) 

523.20 526.01 B: oh definitely i know [laughter] 

524.89 525.73 A: so 

526.17 528.28 B: do that same thing here 

527.77 539.30 A: yeah [laughter] so i'd be curious if they ever if they ever try that it it may overload the computer though [laughter] you know [laughter] 

533.54 534.68 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

534.71 536.08 B: (( possibility )) 

537.81 539.41 B: [laughter] well 

539.95 541.27 B: (( mm mm mm )) 

540.74 543.12 A: shoot but is it dark out there yet 

542.98 544.80 B: it's yes 

545.28 547.69 B: just looking outside yeah it's dark 

547.37 548.90 A: [laughter] 

547.86 551.22 B: and hot oh man it's been hot the last few days 

551.44 556.73 A: well we've had thanks to all those fires from mexico it's been fairly cool cooler than normal 

555.46 556.45 B: really 

557.50 562.06 A: but those'll those'll stop eventually and we'll be back to a billion degrees 

561.67 562.93 B: oh i know 

562.39 569.38 A: [laughter] we're far enough inland to where there's really no respite from you know any coast or anything 

563.36 564.23 B: (( i think )) 

568.64 572.22 B: oh i know i went to beaumont oh a couple of years ago 

572.37 574.19 B: we went in june 

574.00 575.85 A: mhm 

574.58 576.49 B: july i forget now 

576.55 580.97 B: god it was hot out there i thought it was hot here too 

578.32 580.52 A: oh yeah 

581.44 585.08 A: and so muggy 'cause you know we're close to the coast 

582.51 583.59 B: uh-huh 

585.55 587.52 A: [sigh] but 

587.74 592.13 A: (( i don't know though i moved down i'm from chicago i moved down here 'cause i got tired of shoveling snow )) 

592.33 595.78 B: [mn] that's what my husband he came from ohio he said 

594.52 596.73 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

595.96 599.89 B: he got enough of the snow there and he he 

598.59 599.95 A: (( [laughter] yeah ))
