18.54 20.14 A: oh just an hour and a half 

20.41 21.80 B: (( well yeah )) 

20.44 24.33 A: north still cold there 

23.95 32.26 B: [noise] actually today we had a better day at ah we had some sunshine it was in the sixties but it was tolerable the rain's stopped 

31.70 33.14 A: well that's pretty good 

32.47 34.01 B: your rain stopped 

33.92 41.07 A: yeah actually we had a really nice day today look it looked like it was going to rain for a while but it just stayed nice sixty five degrees of so 

36.17 37.25 B: oh great 

40.43 44.42 B: yeah supposedly we're gonna have a next full week of rain 

44.15 46.22 A: yeah so censorship 

46.52 48.81 B: okay censorship 

48.21 50.48 A: yeah this is my first time on here 

50.18 57.86 B: well you know i worked in a ah public high school system for twenty years 

57.46 58.42 A: cool 

58.71 59.95 B: censorship 

60.17 62.46 B: being a catholic too 

62.77 65.01 B: you know that's sort of ah 

65.73 68.58 B: you know that that puts boundaries on you 

68.88 70.12 B: i think 

70.93 73.75 B: do i want them to read anything 

74.21 77.25 B: i don't think i do you probably do don't you 

77.18 79.32 A: (( [laughter] )) 

77.89 81.00 B: well you're younger i can tell by your voice what 

80.63 82.81 A: well that's true um 

83.06 87.59 A: well i i mean i just think that it should be up to parents not not up to 

87.55 99.52 A: the school system to forbid kids to read certain things just because it's a slippery slope once you say that the school board or the principal or whoever can tell the kids no you can't read this book 

99.47 105.69 A: um you know you may control it now you know maybe they're following a catholic approach now 

100.67 101.60 B: mhm 

105.68 115.22 A: ah but what if they're following an evangelical christian approach tomorrow or a jewish approach tomorrow or a muslim approach tomorrow so 

112.93 121.10 B: well see i i had that i have a child that was very very much into the catholic church and married a jewish girl 

120.88 122.56 A: mhm 

121.29 126.04 B: and now he more or less is following the jewish traditions 

125.72 127.45 A: mhm 

126.54 131.79 B: but as far as getting back to the you see in the in the city school district that i worked in 

132.48 138.34 B: we we had very they were very poor kids ah parents ah 

138.63 148.18 B: parents were not really educated and they didn't give a darn what their kids read or didn't read so therefore they did need some guidance wouldn't you think 

144.43 145.77 A: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

147.81 157.53 A: well guidance is one thing but but it [mn] my as my understanding with censorship or banning that's something different in my mind 

156.95 158.62 B: i know i know 

157.66 159.78 A: i think i mean of course the 

158.73 165.97 B: you you don't wanna say that you know this book is here and this has got to come off the shelf and it can not be read 

165.34 174.38 A: right i mean i think that last year i i could be wrong maybe you know i think harry potter was the number one ah book that was taken off high school shelves 

166.06 166.79 B: yes 

172.27 173.19 B: right 

173.54 174.49 B: (( yeah )) 

174.29 184.60 A: and it's just this kind of thing that just i mean the pettiness of it it's sort of like the people who are most likely to want to ban books 

184.62 195.01 A: are also maybe potentially because they're sort of self selecting out the people who don't care so much may be more petty about it [laughter] if you know what i mean so 

193.28 194.02 B: (( [mn] )) 

193.85 197.97 B: yes i i i i i follow you and i know what you mean 

197.76 209.35 B: and i i you know when you say banning books and taking them off the shelves i i get visions of nazism and you know how they went in and burned the books and did all that kind of thing and and certainly you don't want anything 

206.93 208.74 A: yeah 

209.79 220.62 B: ah but you know i don't know i i feel badly for our teenagers today when i look at television and when i look at what what's out there for them to read 

220.84 222.91 B: do you disagree with that 

221.07 221.69 A: (( no )) 

222.94 223.87 A: (( no )) 

223.60 225.49 B: what do you think of a of 

223.96 228.55 A: i i i mean that's your personal opinion i can't i can't disagree that's 

227.21 231.15 B: no no no of course you can disagree i'm asking you your opinion 

229.84 230.75 A: um 

230.98 238.96 A: well i guess let me answer in two parts one is i'm i'm not sure that there's a real need to feel sorry for them today 

238.58 239.68 B: you don't 

239.27 242.55 A: i'm not sure ah whether or not 

240.59 243.10 B: oh jason it is jason right 

242.75 244.07 A: nathan nathan 

243.28 246.54 B: n- nathan i'm sorry nathan may i ask how old you are 

244.30 245.42 A: yeah 

246.19 247.50 A: i'm twenty four 

247.28 249.83 B: oh nathan yes you're twenty four 

249.42 251.94 A: [laughter] 

250.02 252.14 B: [laughter] ah 

253.06 253.97 B: (( ah )) 

255.22 263.95 B: it doesn't disturb you when you turn that t._v. on and it's shooting and it's ah all this this 

265.04 266.09 A: well 

265.08 268.04 B: no no it doesn't dist- well you're young 

266.85 279.35 A: well no don't say that yet i you know i ah i don't obviously i don't think that's great [laughter] and um i think that especially um kids who don't have a lot of parental oversight 

268.87 270.30 B: what what what 

272.06 273.10 B: yes 

278.58 280.42 B: (( that's right and and )) 

279.20 282.59 A: um you know i think that they may develop a 

283.32 290.70 A: mis- you know they may develop misunderstandings about what a civil way to live is [laughter] 

286.06 287.98 B: and i think 

289.04 297.10 B: right right and this is that's exactly it what a civil way you know in in in our paper this morning 

297.22 299.76 B: we had a young man stabbed 

301.06 306.09 B: by another young man they were at a party and they were having a fight over a girl 

306.23 307.42 A: (( oh jeeze )) 

306.90 308.22 B: he died 

308.03 309.80 A: right 

308.90 315.23 B: you know a fight over a girl they're eighteen they're nineteen they're at a party 

315.63 317.27 B: it's it's just 

317.84 319.61 B: isn't that mind boggling 

319.26 323.28 A: oh it's mind boggling and but the second part of my answer was gonna be that 

323.41 338.14 A: a lot of this stuff that happens today that's reported widely in the media happened a hundred years ago as well and it's i think it's a widely held misperception that somehow the past was better safer healthier 

338.05 344.63 A: um but really if you look at human history that's not really true [laughter] i mean 

340.60 341.51 B: (( oh i )) 

342.65 346.77 B: didn't didn't we always kill one another didn't we always 

345.38 349.22 A: yeah unfortunately you know [laughter] 

347.12 352.10 B: didn't we always go to war didn't we always i mean go back into the 

350.25 363.22 A: yeah i mean think well think think back to your catholic faith i mean a lot of what you find in your religion is talking about the darker side of unfortunately the darker side of life and human nature and i think that it's 

353.78 354.63 B: yeah 

360.86 361.83 B: of life 

361.91 362.76 B: yes 

363.03 367.78 A: it's not something that t._v. alone can be blamed for i think it needs to go 

367.95 377.59 A: it needs to go further than that [laughter] you need to go further than that to look for culprits i agree though i think you know you turn on the t._v. and i can totally see why you would be dismayed 

377.45 383.47 A: that kids would be watching some of this stuff or reading some of this stuff ah i'm not disagreeing there i'm just not sure that that's 

379.10 380.72 B: (( yes yeah )) 

383.50 386.33 A: first of all that that's really the root cause 

386.06 388.12 B: well nathan can we begin there 

388.27 389.31 A: sure 

388.77 392.30 B: [laughter] i i mean you know where do we begin 

392.51 397.14 B: i i'd like to know where we begin you know i have seven grandchildren 

396.76 398.89 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

398.04 400.10 B: and um 

400.46 411.73 B: you know i have seven different types of grandchildren some leaders some followers and sometimes i get very very afraid 

411.53 412.44 A: (( hm )) 

412.58 418.97 B: watching them and and and listening eh listening to the so- you know when they get in the car with me 

418.79 419.82 A: yeah 

419.08 422.82 B: i go nuts i mean they right away they turn this radio on 

422.88 424.04 B: and you're getting 

423.00 423.89 A: mhm 

424.91 427.03 B: you know i don't even know what they're saying 

427.15 428.42 A: [laughter] 

427.57 431.13 B: i i yeah i can't follow it but you know i know it's not good 

429.57 430.61 A: yeah 

431.66 432.64 A: yeah 

431.96 437.30 B: and there they are they're hipping hopping around in the back of that car and they're going up and down and 

437.43 451.17 B: you know i guess i'm getting to be too old but it it bothers me and as far as censorship is in one way i don't like it we had it in catholic school a great deal censorship when i went through yes we did 

445.16 446.08 A: mhm 

448.73 450.53 A: mhm 

451.25 453.17 A: that was a private school though 

452.95 455.18 B: oh yes that was a private school 

453.81 456.64 A: right there's there's a big difference between 

456.58 469.29 A: what the government does and what people do when they choose to put their kids in a private institution right because you get the public education for free right so that's where that's 

461.21 462.12 B: yes 

462.62 464.50 B: yeah yes yes 

466.26 467.38 B: yes 

467.65 472.27 B: yeah but i don't think we do you feel we have a lot of censorship 

472.49 476.51 B: now these harry potter books that you said they were banned but didn't they put them back 

476.50 485.53 A: well it depends on the district and you know i don't think censorship is common in public schools today i think that there are political elements who wish it would be common 

477.08 479.02 B: the ban the ban was 

480.94 481.80 B: no 

482.39 483.28 B: no 

485.50 494.50 A: and that and that in fact the government would if i were them ideally would decide what anybody could read at any time and that's the scary part [mn] 

485.67 486.65 B: well 

493.70 497.06 B: oh that would be terrible no that that's not us 

496.89 506.88 A: i i'm not saying it is but there are people like that and once you create the ability to do that how do you know who is going to use that tool that weapon 

498.81 500.03 B: no but i mean 

500.73 502.42 B: yes there there would be 

506.03 508.88 B: you're right i i agree with you 

507.42 516.12 A: you know it's kind of like it's kind of like nuclear weapons [laughter] you know mankind can create those but can you really in the end control who uses them 

510.84 511.74 B: i know 

515.52 517.48 B: no we can't can we 

517.37 520.72 A: no obviously not so [laughter]
