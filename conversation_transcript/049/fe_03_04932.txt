1.58 3.03 B: (( hello )) 

1.62 2.77 A: hello 

2.81 3.91 A: hi 

3.05 5.86 B: hi [laughter] hi i'm dale 

5.77 7.12 A: hi my name is yen 

7.34 8.86 B: yen okay 

9.23 16.03 B: well i'm afraid i didn't totally hear the topic um it was [mn] 

16.14 21.06 B: did i feel something about the divorce rate has impro- has affected 

21.10 24.77 B: mm um has affected me did you hear it 

23.78 27.59 A: yeah i i heard it something like divorce about like family value 

28.66 32.70 A: or something uh i can't really hear [laughter] it it's really fast 

28.86 29.91 B: right 

32.37 39.90 B: yeah well [mn] i guess it was the same problem i had [mn] i i think the the topic was do i feel 

40.12 41.89 B: that the 

42.40 44.45 B: divorce rate has 

44.99 46.54 B: affected me 

47.58 48.52 A: oh okay 

48.48 52.71 B: something like [laughter] that [mn] so um 

49.56 50.78 A: [laughter] 

53.61 57.42 B: well i think the divorce rate's always been fairly high [mn] 

58.10 61.19 B: not always but in in recent history 

60.99 61.94 A: uh-huh 

62.18 64.36 B: so i can't say that um 

64.93 69.68 B: [mn] currently you know there's any it has any affect on me 

70.23 80.13 A: um well i think like more divorce uh has like um has a certain impact into like american values 

80.25 88.83 A: such like um used to be like like fam- like family values you know it's it's really big deal of having like a nuclear family with 

88.94 98.57 A: like two parents and like not just kids but now it's more like a single parent is not um is not as bad as before you know what i'm saying 

99.27 111.81 B: right it well it's not it's not as un- it's more common anyway yeah um i know there have been i've read about studies you know showing that 

103.83 107.10 A: yeah yeah 

112.44 117.88 B: children raised in two parent homes um 

117.97 120.92 B: tend to have fewer problems i guess 

121.02 122.04 B: um 

122.12 126.77 B: i don't know maybe there've been something more recent i remember that from several years ago 

126.18 133.08 A: yeah i think the recent one is they refuted that one i just read like a [mn] i read a article like a few days ago saying like 

129.11 130.30 B: oh really 

133.41 147.01 A: um it's not like psychology it's saying like before uh psychologists used to think like um yeah like children will have less like more problems if they are raised in a single parent but they just recently refuted that so i don't know [laughter] 

142.08 143.19 B: mhm 

145.80 146.93 B: wow 

147.05 150.39 A: i guess maybe the ideologies [mn] keep on changing 

150.38 153.34 B: yeah i guess so that's interesting then 

153.28 164.91 A: yeah but i do feel like having both parents is is better or in a way like reinforcing the family values because you do have like two people to look up to 

165.11 167.74 A: rather than just one because they say 

167.91 173.82 A: like you have a son and then he's raised by a single mother it's really hard for that son to find a father role figure 

174.60 176.51 B: oh i totally agree 

176.60 177.50 B: (( um )) 

176.76 178.56 A: yeah 

177.72 182.97 B: i happen to have six children myself and and feel very 

180.87 181.78 A: uh-huh 

183.25 193.36 B: um strongly about the values that we have instilled in them and and we make a conscious effort to really um 

193.29 203.99 B: teach them to be what we consider you know morally upright and um what wh- what we consider to be have our family values and it it certainly does 

205.21 209.17 B: make it easier when you have two parents as you say you've got 

209.23 211.55 B: two different role models and 

211.85 213.23 B: and um 

214.66 219.15 B: it's a more stable environment maybe also because 

220.56 223.07 B: you have two parents who are at home 

223.13 227.26 B: instead of you know dating and and having a 

223.19 224.17 A: uh-huh 

227.54 230.45 B: maybe um changing 

232.00 238.82 B: [mn] a variety of opposite sex parents or or adult figures in their life maybe 

238.64 240.48 A: mhm 

240.23 243.73 B: so that would also increase his add to the stability 

243.76 255.58 A: yeah also i think like parents who are or parent who are dating have less time for their kids because they do have to establish like their relationship of their own 

248.74 249.76 B: mhm 

251.42 252.84 B: that's true 

256.79 257.82 A: so then 

256.96 258.45 B: that's true 

258.39 262.69 A: yeah so i guess like kids might get ign- ignored so then um 

262.75 273.09 A: they grew up with less attention and then i've been reading like um kids who have re- who received more attention when they were small grow up to be more confident uh 

273.06 282.67 A: like better performance like academically and socially so then they're like even smarter and stuff so i was thinking like 

275.72 276.73 B: mhm 

277.42 278.39 B: (( well )) 

280.09 281.65 B: (( well that makes sense )) 

284.76 286.99 B: that make a lot of sense to me 

287.17 288.50 A: yeah 

287.57 289.47 B: that that that would be the case 

289.56 290.79 A: yeah 

289.69 295.35 B: uh giving them more self confidence because they're not constantly struggling to get attention 

292.22 293.10 A: uh-huh 

295.22 296.36 A: yeah true 

296.52 297.58 B: yeah 

296.79 304.39 A: so i think yeah also i think it's also somehow like you know how divorce rate in u. s. is also getting high 

304.53 305.61 B: mhm 

304.69 306.88 A: it's it's like over fifty percent now 

306.83 307.68 B: (( is it )) 

307.04 310.54 A: so we have more divorced parents than we have married [laughter] 

310.78 311.92 B: wow 

312.15 314.97 B: well i have uh i happen to 

316.18 322.11 B: m- my community and my my social group you know is a pretty stable 

322.23 323.56 B: um 

324.17 331.28 B: situation for most people i think i'm i'm not exposed to that too much anymore i used to be uh 

332.98 337.31 B: where my peers were divorcing more but things seemed to have [laughter] settled down 

337.16 338.30 A: uh-huh 

337.32 342.36 B: in my um group so i i wasn't aware that it had was still climbing that's 

343.88 345.62 A: yeah like 

344.12 345.40 B: i'm sorry to hear it 

345.45 360.44 A: um like i'm a college student right now so then um a lot like quite a few of my friends their parents are either divorced or remarried and then i think it does like affect them although they don't show it like 

354.12 355.19 B: mhm 

360.48 366.68 A: um because you can't no matter what you can't replace your biological father with like your foster father 

366.66 367.85 B: mhm 

366.74 368.54 A: like no matter what it just 

368.77 372.02 A: i i don't know it just it's just different for them 

369.01 370.13 B: yeah 

371.15 373.51 B: there there you're right there's something 

374.05 376.67 B: in born in us about that i think 

376.76 381.49 A: yeah so i don't know i think like um 

381.54 383.14 A: like uh if 

383.29 392.80 A: like a lot of us [mn] personally i feel like a lot of family values are gone because like uh sometime in college i notice like um 

393.20 397.64 A: to go out more like liberal to sex and stuff which is 

397.67 407.47 A: sort of against like s- sort of american family values like the more traditional ones so i i'm not sure if i can attribute that to 

401.83 402.89 B: mhm 

403.58 404.78 B: mhm 

407.64 413.44 A: um like the high divorce rate but i think it does have like a certain effect to it 

412.82 416.94 B: well a a parent who's dating and and having 

418.07 425.06 B: at least intimate relationships you know with other people certainly doesn't help a a child 

425.86 427.30 B: (( have um )) 

427.32 429.79 B: strong feelings about uh 

430.24 431.30 B: about 

431.57 434.18 B: the values in that situation 

434.20 435.81 A: yeah definitely 

435.25 436.07 B: (( so )) 

436.20 446.01 A: like when yeah when they when they see their parents having like just like switching partners all the time they too would feel like oh it is okay it is just 

444.46 446.31 B: yeah yeah 

446.50 448.20 A: yeah 

447.40 449.89 B: well i think i think that's right 

450.18 455.89 A: yeah um like in my community like it's pretty liberal because i live in l. a. 

450.27 451.08 B: um 

455.85 456.84 B: mhm 

456.60 463.71 A: so then like um like the sort of family traditional family value is not as emphasized 

463.80 465.21 A: as before 

465.52 467.69 A: i when d- when during my parents age 

467.81 479.85 B: yeah yeah well my children see that um in their peers too i have um i i have a son who's in college and i have a daughter who's in high school 

479.98 481.44 B: (( and um )) 

481.52 486.21 B: i guess now that i think about it probably the majority of their friends 

486.61 490.63 B: don't live with both of their biological parents 

490.58 491.99 A: yeah 

491.41 498.68 B: or even both adopted parents but um you know they they come from a home that's been divorced 

498.39 500.32 A: mhm 

500.37 502.63 A: yeah definitely 

500.54 501.41 B: um 

501.88 502.70 B: yeah 

503.40 509.09 A: like hello oh sorry go [mn] oh i thought i got cut off 'cause i'm using a cell phone 

505.42 507.40 B: i'm still here [laughter] 

509.99 515.83 B: [mn] did it take them a long oops i'm sorry i forgot i got i was about to get off the topic [laughter] go ahead 

510.07 511.51 A: (( so yeah )) 

512.34 512.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

514.91 517.04 A: oh no oh okay um 

517.26 519.76 A: uh like for 

520.20 530.31 A: like i think like certain family val- like uh like i think the family values that are lost mostly were like like the respect for parents and then 

530.56 542.19 A: it's more uh like um like sort of like having sex after marriage like those kind of values you know like more pertinent to like parent like whether or not you have some adult to talk to 

542.16 543.20 B: mhm 

542.49 545.26 A: those kind of [mn] like problems what do you think 

545.62 547.95 B: uh i think you're you're right 

548.00 548.97 B: yeah 

549.10 550.13 B: the 

552.39 556.22 B: a- as far as the [mn] different family values 

556.74 559.27 B: that are affected by um 

560.17 563.68 B: children who are from who are in a a divorced 

564.54 566.06 B: family um 

566.95 573.84 B: you know there are more than just the parents dating i guess that as far as which what values would be affected 

574.48 576.56 B: the importance of 

577.34 580.47 B: being home together and 

580.80 585.26 B: developing traits like honesty and and 

585.73 586.72 B: the 

587.07 589.45 B: dependence on the core 

589.77 594.43 B: family and and maybe responsibilities and 

594.66 599.95 B: um i i think all of those things are affected when a [mn] a child doesn't have a
