209.99 218.17 B: well yeah like i said i bought that pedometer and i'm i really i know that i'm getting ready to turn thirty in [noise] a coupla years and 

217.46 218.71 A: (( mhm )) 

218.19 220.69 B: i know i need to start now [laughter] 

220.27 230.20 A: yeah 'cause trust me it doesn't get any easier as you get older [laughter] and it's just it's a matter too of um once you get in the habit it's no big deal i mean if you just make it a point to 

223.67 225.45 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

230.23 236.61 A: now now you have a young kid there i hear right yeah so it it so that that's exercise in itself 

232.26 233.35 B: (( yeah )) 

236.00 237.51 B: [laughter] 

236.86 239.69 A: um how old is she how old he or she 

239.04 240.85 B: he he's one 

240.40 241.68 A: oh okay 

241.71 246.84 A: so give it another year and a half two years you'll be running around chasing after him all the time anyway 

244.64 245.86 B: [noise] 

246.25 248.18 B: [noise] probably so [sigh] 

246.92 249.25 A: so you'll definitely get in shape with that 

249.04 250.06 B: [noise] 

249.33 251.83 A: um trust me i know these things 

251.77 253.17 B: [laughter] 

252.01 253.88 A: (( and um )) 

254.49 259.87 A: you'll uh you know so that'll do it but if you just get in the habit of like going out for half an hour after dinner 

259.71 262.76 B: yeah it's a matter of finding the time 

260.18 261.71 A: and walking it's usually 

261.84 263.26 A: mhm 

263.17 264.25 B: but uh 

264.03 268.26 A: well just pack the munchkin up and go [laughter] walk'll do you both good 

265.98 270.83 B: [laughter] yeah i wish he could walk 

270.50 276.03 A: mhm well i mean you know getting him getting him out in the air is just you know is good in general so 

276.11 283.78 B: [noise] yeah we like to walk and jump rope and we actually have a weight bench here or like one of those home gym things 

280.30 281.98 A: (( um )) 

282.53 284.53 A: (( mm mhm right right )) 

283.99 285.81 B: but i don't ever use it 

285.36 291.87 A: [lipsmack] well if you got it there you might as well i mean just you you have to be careful with that because when people um 

289.63 291.07 B: [noise] 

293.07 300.87 A: especially you shouldn't you shouldn't do that alone simply because if you hurt yourself you're going to you know what are you going to do isn't 

299.63 301.64 B: it's the kind with the um 

301.74 307.82 B: it's like got the weight the weights in the back and and then you're like yeah 

302.61 304.15 A: yeah it's a gym pack 

305.02 306.98 A: right yeah a gym pack yeah 

307.18 312.91 A: but the uh still i mean you can still hurt yourself you can still pull muscles or just you know if you're not careful yeah 

311.23 317.76 B: really i haven't even i've used it like i've probably sat down on that thing like maybe once or twice just playing with it but 

316.64 317.96 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

317.93 321.72 B: [noise] i don't know i just i i'm out of shape and 

321.83 324.34 B: i just [laughter] don't see myself kinda 

323.33 324.24 A: that's 

324.41 326.58 B: do working out on that thing 

326.35 334.18 A: that's the toughest part the the toughest part is when you're when you first get started and most of the time most of us start working out again 'cause we are out of shape 

334.00 335.58 B: re- really [noise] 

334.48 338.53 A: and it's the most frustrating time to do it because you can't do the things you want to do 

338.71 351.91 A: it's very tiring and you don't really necessarily see a lot of progress initially because you you'll start to feel it but you won't actually see it because your body's got to burn off you know it's got to burn off the extra fat cells that we're not using 

349.34 350.47 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

351.94 356.41 B: [noise] yeah i've got a lot of little baby weight [laughter] 

351.99 353.90 A: um and it's 

355.59 358.34 A: mhm yeah well that's that's 

356.83 358.47 B: that i need to get rid of 

358.36 363.33 A: that's the other thing the [mn] you know well walking and biking and biking is really good for that 

363.46 365.92 A: um yeah 

363.55 365.20 B: i don't have a bike 

365.99 366.87 B: but 

367.65 369.22 B: i don't know i i 

369.35 372.30 B: [noise] think walking might take too long [laughter] 

371.38 372.41 A: (( um )) 

372.71 375.79 A: again you know all you have to do is a half an hour and you know 

375.11 379.00 B: but if you say just half an hour i guess i could commit to that 

378.25 382.11 A: yeah i mean that's all you really and if you know just um 

382.61 391.79 A: pack up pack up your son and uh you know go with him you know put him put him in the stroller and go and it's you know it'll do you both some good where do you where do you live 

384.98 386.68 B: [noise] 

391.54 395.94 B: [laughter] uh i live in a small town in mahoney north carolina [noise] 

394.94 398.91 A: okay okay yeah so long as there are places to walk around there you'll be fine 

397.79 402.44 B: (( yeah there is a little sidewalk right in front of my house [laughter] all i have to do is go out there )) 

401.81 410.48 A: that's good that's good 'cause a lot of peo- you know a lot of people live in places where it's tough to it's tough to walk around i mean i'm i'm about fifteen minutes out of manhattan 

410.45 412.19 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah )) 

410.71 414.54 A: (( um so i mean i i uh you know i'll go )) 

413.07 417.38 B: well everybody round there walks round there don't they everybody around there walks 

414.64 415.64 A: i'm sorry 

416.40 421.94 A: oh absolutely absolutely um and it's really funny too 'cause every once and a while i run into people fr- i 

421.79 431.95 A: used to work in the music business and i'd run into people they'd be come in from the west coast and they'd be like are are aren't we going to take a a cab it's four blocks and like no we're going to walk get yourself get yourself ready 

425.81 429.15 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] ))

432.11 437.26 A: you guys are the exercise nuts over the west coast uh you know get ready for it 

435.96 438.74 B: yeah 

437.54 439.29 A: and we uh 

439.91 442.63 A: you know we didn't have any problem with that we just uh 

440.03 441.05 B: [noise] 

442.87 443.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

443.50 447.78 A: i i corralled them and said no we're walking to the venue go 

446.46 449.04 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

448.13 451.65 A: oh woo woo woo no move you need the exercise 

449.06 450.18 B: [laughter] 

450.90 451.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

452.30 453.08 A: (( so )) 

452.41 454.80 B: [noise] yeah definitely 

453.80 456.60 A: so we we definitely walk all over the place i mean you know 

455.44 456.41 B: [noise] 

456.85 464.37 B: well that's good i i need to start walking more [laughter] this is my wakeup call here right here 

457.85 459.22 A: mhm 

460.32 462.13 A: yeah you know why 'cause it's it's 

463.84 471.83 A: yeah well i i'll tell you it's it's low impact you know so it's not going to do damage to your knees or anything it's excellent for your abdominal muscles 

467.44 469.03 B: (( [laughter] )) 

469.92 470.48 B: [noise] 

471.88 477.27 A: it's excellent for getting you know uh the especially like after a pregnancy 

474.80 475.90 B: [noise] 

477.08 478.20 B: yeah 

477.45 484.03 A: it's really one of the best things you can do because it's low impact it's not like you're running or jogging you know 

483.10 486.84 B: [noise] so how long do you think it'll be before i see any progress 

486.75 497.90 A: so well if you go out and you do it conscientiously on a daily basis i mean you know you'll start to feel better and you'll you know you're not going to see it immediately but you'll start to feel better you'll notice that you know it doesn't 

498.23 505.59 A: the legs don't bother you as much when you do it after a few days that you know you'll find you're getting your uh you you're getting your wind back 

500.24 501.50 B: (( [noise] )) 

505.75 507.82 A: um so i mean 

506.65 508.28 B: [noise] 

508.63 511.29 A: as far as actual uh 

511.74 514.91 A: you know actual reduction in the weight 

512.31 512.89 B: [noise] 

513.77 514.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

515.00 522.21 A: if you do it every day and you gradually go a little bit longer every day um you know within a month 

515.18 515.77 B: [noise] 

518.61 519.57 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

519.86 523.64 B: [mn] yeah [noise] so how long do you think i should start out at 

524.05 535.31 A: oh about a half hour i said which is normal which is like that's a little bit over it's for for the average person walking three miles an hour now if you're taking your son it's going to be a little bit slower than that with the stroller what have you 

531.37 532.46 B: [noise] 

534.27 536.06 B: [noise] [noise] yeah 

535.40 537.57 A: um you know a mile 

537.86 543.16 A: mile and a half that's all i mean a mile the average person walks three miles an hour 

543.70 546.37 A: so you gotta figure that's you know 

543.80 544.77 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

546.52 551.79 B: so how i i got that pedometer what do you think would be a good number to start with for uh 

546.99 548.10 A: fifteen minutes 

552.64 554.09 B: steps per day 

554.36 558.73 A: steps per day depends on your stride [laughter] obviously but uh 

557.86 562.37 B: yeah they say they say ten thousand steps is like a good target 

562.17 567.47 A: yeah that probably sounds about right i haven't figured it out exactly but you got to figure miles five 

567.86 568.78 A: (( times [mn] )) 

568.51 572.75 B: [noise] i think it's like fifty uh fifty inches per step 

572.59 579.28 A: yeah yeah so that's probably that's probably about two and a half three miles which is yeah that's like in that's like maybe an hour 

573.33 574.54 B: with that thing 

579.34 580.56 A: um 

580.67 583.44 A: but that's that's fine um 

580.71 581.49 B: oh 

583.10 585.29 B: but that's like all day long 

585.00 590.62 A: right right so i mean if you figure if you go for a half an hour walk you probably knock off about half of that 

589.01 589.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

590.55 595.21 B: yeah [noise] 

591.26 593.71 A: (( you know and um )) 

594.82 599.53 A: it uh so long as you keep it consistent and you get into a into the habit of just 

598.19 599.89 B: (( so how long do you work out do ))
