0.43 1.70 A: hello 

1.34 3.86 B: hi ah i'm veronica 

3.68 5.19 A: hi i'm louis 

4.87 11.91 B: hi louis um i guess we're supposed to talk about whether public and private schools have the right to censor 

8.24 9.98 A: [laughter] 

11.75 13.05 A: that's right 

11.92 14.29 B: ah books for their students 

14.36 17.82 B: um have you had any experience ah in this arena 

17.82 19.15 A: (( um [mn] )) 

19.82 22.62 A: you mean in this or in the ah [laughter] 

21.70 25.87 B: in in in being at a school where this was an issue or 

25.36 29.70 A: um no not really not ah i haven't been to school in a while 

29.56 30.79 B: mhm 

29.71 31.87 A: (( ah but ah )) 

32.18 37.13 A: i mean my feeling on censorship i think it there are some things that are not proper 

37.19 39.32 A: ah in some ways to 

39.81 40.61 A: you know 

41.09 47.26 A: to give out for for school kids there there's maturity levels ah that i think you have to consider 

47.33 49.70 A: but then you have the 

49.93 55.00 A: who is the judge of that and that's where you know censorship i think doesn't 

55.16 57.69 A: i'm not sure where how that all fits in 

57.94 68.96 B: right and i don't know in in the existing systems whether these decisions are made by the school board or the principal and faculty or the parents' association or 

68.81 74.86 B: who actually determines what is suitable and what is not suitable i know 

70.82 71.80 A: (( what )) 

73.91 76.74 A: right and i think in a case it would be you know 

76.87 91.77 A: probably would be a good idea to have everyone involved ah the parents of course should have a say in what's what's being censored and what's not the teacher who's teaching th- the child ah you know or the authorities i should say 

80.08 81.14 B: mhm 

91.85 96.22 A: that are involved in this but i think the parents are a very important part of this 

96.83 97.97 A: decision 

97.75 103.62 B: i would think so too i've i have heard of um controversy over 

103.72 114.57 B: teaching huckleberry finn for example in high schools um because of the n. word because of the some of the character's attitudes towards blacks 

114.29 115.26 A: right 

114.63 125.04 B: and all that and and i i watched a program on public t._v. about it once and parents were very very upset that this book was being taught in in their childrens' school 

125.05 130.20 B: because they felt that even just using the n. word was was 

130.42 136.51 B: so um degrading and shameful and horrible to their students of color 

133.86 134.91 A: (( [noise] )) 

136.42 151.24 B: that that it was just it was too awful and yet the whole thrust of huckleberry finn is anti slavery and and trying to show that blacks are people just just as whites are and sometimes they're of a higher moral character 

144.48 145.62 A: (( right )) 

151.27 152.18 A: right 

151.38 153.62 B: so ah i don't know 

153.90 168.25 B: i don't know what the i think in some s- schools it was banned and in other schools [mn] even in spite of protest um the book was kept on on the reading list and i and i think one of the schools used the strategy 

168.28 175.29 B: of allowing the students to choose if they wished to read the book so that if they or their parents found it offensive 

175.38 187.64 B: they could elect to read something else or [mn] and maybe in case like that where this is considered like you know the great american novel of that a certain point in in american literature history 

175.80 177.02 A: right 

185.26 186.56 A: [laughter] 

186.89 188.89 A: right right 

188.21 192.25 B: that it would be um up to the parents yeah 

190.20 200.57 A: appropriate yeah well i think you know ah my my view that is that it's it's literature and so in the times that it [mn] that this was written 

197.16 198.24 B: mhm 

200.61 209.65 A: that word for example ah was used often and it was part of i guess part of the culture of how things were were being thought of 

209.31 210.30 B: mhm 

210.00 211.29 A: um 

211.46 219.02 A: and it's just indicative of the times i don't think it has anything bearing well i guess in some cases i mean obviously we still have 

219.09 230.37 A: ah for example predit- prejudices going on now ah but those those times it was very normal to have that kind of vocabulary not not saying that it's correct 

227.88 228.80 B: right 

230.38 231.72 B: exactly 

230.40 239.28 A: you know knowing what we know now but that's the way it was then and it is a book i mean [mn] despite that like you say it does have 

239.27 245.63 A: ah you know good points about how slavery is is bad and and so on and how 

245.82 253.60 A: i mean th- the point the point of the book really should not be about what words were used in it but what the whole 

253.99 256.24 A: you know story says 

255.81 257.45 B: mhm mhm 

256.87 262.51 A: um but even if the story had something that you know maybe mm 

262.65 267.59 A: i don't know i don't know may- maybe the story was portrayed negatively 

268.22 280.52 A: [sigh] and if you're studying some sort ah author or storyline of of whatever time that it was or trying to prove a point to someone then why not use it as well i mean it's just 

280.95 281.79 A: you know 

282.27 286.77 B: right and but the hard part is who who makes the ultimate decision 

285.58 287.74 A: exactly exactly 

286.98 290.58 B: and what criteria do they use to make that decision 

290.65 300.45 B: as you said earlier i think everybody needs to v- be involved in that ah the parents the the faculty the principal the school board all that kind of stuff 

290.86 291.88 A: (( you're right it's )) 

294.35 295.33 A: right 

298.75 300.36 A: sure sure 

300.98 307.25 B: and obviously in a school situation rather than just like at the public library or out in the world 

301.75 302.31 A: (( [mn] )) 

307.67 319.92 B: every thing that's that's on the reading list or in the library is controlled to an extent simply because of the limits of time and space and all that sort of stuff so somebody make a decision about everything that's there 

314.71 315.80 A: sure 

320.01 328.66 B: and i don't again i i'm not familiar with the workings of the educational system enough to know who is ultimately responsible for that decision [noise] 

327.85 336.86 A: right well i think um you know there probably is an imbalance and maybe this is where it all comes out and people don't feel like they're part of it or 

336.84 340.79 A: ah like i said i i think parents have a big say 

340.69 341.90 A: um 

341.80 352.69 A: well i mean obviously they're not they're not the authority about what children will benefit best from in teaching of ah literature and all that 

352.59 364.77 A: but but they can certainly understand if you had a parent and let's say involved in this they can certainly understand you know if if the outcome of the story even though it has all this information 

364.69 373.20 A: ah is a positive one then i think a parent would say yes that's a good book regardless of what the words that are used in in inside of it 

372.70 374.04 B: mhm 

373.43 374.59 A: um 

374.61 375.23 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

375.28 378.01 A: you know as far as like ah l- let's say 

378.22 381.20 A: that we're using just words um 

381.44 387.93 A: to describe someone but then there are things such as you know sexual nature or um 

386.66 387.50 B: (( mm )) 

388.11 390.02 A: ah you know ah 

390.83 398.25 A: um um gore maybe you know how how young do you start all this that's that's another issue and again that's all 

398.35 401.75 A: the authorities and the parents they all have to get together 

401.80 405.55 A: now censorship is one of those things that um 

405.61 408.21 A: i feel again is um 

409.21 415.15 A: you know [laughter] there's there will always be one person um [lipsmack] 

415.79 424.89 A: who is maybe a little bit extreme actually speaking of censorship i just had ah i w- i was watching the other day this ah program on t._v. about um 

418.04 419.03 B: mhm 

424.78 432.27 A: about films and there was a period right after for example the um marlene dietrich and um 

432.64 435.44 A: you know mae west tho- those types of movies 

435.03 436.23 B: mhm 

435.62 438.56 A: there was one man who was 

438.80 444.19 A: [mn] a religious you know fanatic he was a catholic um 

443.16 444.07 B: uh-huh 

444.25 450.20 A: and he was so fanatical about it he thought tha the movies were portraying 

450.10 460.78 A: ah content that should not in so for thirty years because of this one person who felt this way and i'm sure he had his you know people who followed him in bits here and there 

460.87 466.04 A: because of him thirty years of film were really um 

466.22 468.99 A: [lipsmack] limited in what they could show 

469.06 471.19 A: even though [mn] it 

471.37 481.40 A: wasn't necessarily offensive to everyone but it was offensive to him and what he believed and that dictated thirty years of film not being 

473.52 474.89 B: right 

480.84 484.98 B: was he in a a position of power in the motion picture industry 

483.95 496.03 A: he was yes yes and he didn't start out that way ah but he was in there ah you know and then slowly climbed up and when he had the chance he completely he came out with this 

485.40 486.69 B: oh 

495.96 506.14 A: ah code in what people could say and not say and what they could show and not show in the film and that lasted thirty years 

504.34 505.51 B: mhm 

505.98 506.81 B: wow 

506.10 515.79 A: and that's why you stop when you watch the black and white movies for example like mae west now you know how mae west was very um you know she was full of innuendos 

515.46 516.39 B: yes 

516.14 518.03 A: um wh- 

518.06 532.92 A: that stopped and in consequence i guess some careers also stopped ah and mae west and because that was her nature to be so full of those ah innuendo you know her film career ended 

523.73 524.75 B: (( oh my )) 

532.79 538.37 A: but it didn't allow the freedom to say or do the things you know film 

538.48 543.63 A: film and books and all these things these are expressions of people's you know 

543.68 545.03 A: (( ah ah ah )) 

545.16 547.91 A: ways of what what they wanna say 

547.82 550.02 B: right or their vision of the world 

547.94 549.24 A: but they were 

549.32 554.78 A: their vision of the world and they and and their views were 

554.87 558.20 A: you know because of this one person were said to be 

558.22 559.60 A: wrong 

559.09 559.78 B: (( hm )) 

559.82 562.11 B: and their expression is stifled 

560.30 568.13 A: and that's not necessarily true exactly they were stifled and that's not necessarily good in my pinion you know i mean if if 

563.00 564.39 B: yeah hm 

565.20 566.88 B: right right 

568.40 571.06 A: if a parent for example with children 

571.17 572.87 A: if a parent doesn't 

573.45 582.82 A: want to you know have their child see this they just won't take them there or won't let them watch t._v. or i mean that's just 

578.92 579.70 B: right 

583.22 585.12 A: where ah where do you live 

585.33 588.08 B: i live in in the pacific northwest in seattle mhm
