134.32 143.18 A: [lipsmack] when you go out to eat th- that's when you put on the pounds because you figure at a restaurant you just tend to eat more you're not as conscious i think like if you were eating home 

141.29 142.25 B: well n- 

142.53 150.41 B: and i understand that from uh a lot of the research that they've done recently is that the restaurant portions have gotten larger over the years 

150.40 151.35 A: oh 

151.64 158.76 B: and uh that's a problem because uh people uh tend to want to eat the entire thing and get your money's worth
