11.79 14.28 A: cool daytona beach florida 

13.68 20.41 B: y- you know i didn't get the first part of the question of the uh topic what was it 

19.62 25.48 A: it d- deals with divorce rate h- has divorce rate changed your outlook in uh 

25.54 28.82 A: family values and stuff like that 

27.32 29.11 B: uh-huh oh okay 

29.31 38.36 A: and uh do you think it like you know changes us and yeah so yeah i personally i guess you know i this is the first time i've ever done this 

38.52 41.60 B: [laughter] yeah this is my last call 

39.49 40.65 A: (( but )) 

41.42 43.56 A: right on well um 

43.57 46.79 A: i been through five divorces 

46.25 49.44 B: [laughter] oh oh my goodness 

48.66 50.39 A: not personally 

50.34 52.43 B: oh okay okay 

51.63 54.48 A: as uh a child 

54.24 55.72 B: oh goodness 

55.77 59.10 A: so my mom was married five different times 

58.79 60.32 B: oh my 

60.56 61.90 A: (( yeah )) 

61.94 66.44 B: so i'm sure you have quite a different outlook on marriage huh 

66.05 73.06 A: yeah exactly so yeah i i i do believe that the divorce rate has changed my perception of family values 

73.66 75.53 A: [laughter] 

74.64 85.59 B: yeah um well i mean that's interesting you know because we always think about it from the people who are getting the divorces but the ones most affected are the children 

82.52 83.51 A: mhm 

85.81 88.22 A: yeah i i i would believe that 

86.13 87.48 B: and there's no way 

87.63 88.83 B: you don't think so 

88.45 90.20 A: i would i would believe that 

89.60 104.01 B: oh oh definitely because they have no way of knowing anything to get any better because they haven't experienced anything worse they have no way to measure their feelings and so those emotions stay with them you know 

90.22 91.81 A: i i do believe that 

104.80 108.52 B: so that's that's interesting to hear you say that because um 

109.44 111.82 B: now my parents always stayed together 

111.82 113.18 A: oh great 

112.55 114.41 B: and you know 

114.53 119.44 B: it's [mn] you know you wonder with all that they went through was it worth it 

118.56 121.35 A: through thick and thin yeah i think it was worth it 

120.72 130.14 B: yeah from a child's perspective there's no doubt about it you don't care what happened to 'em you don't care what they're going through or what their issues are you just want a whole family 

129.54 134.03 A: yeah it just makes sense to me that you know once yo- once you have a family started that 

134.04 135.78 A: you work your way through it you know 

135.59 137.35 B: are you married now 

136.75 138.50 A: no never been married 

137.90 139.86 B: [laughter] 

139.39 140.48 A: never been 

140.06 142.31 B: that's funny yeah 

141.17 151.24 A: and like my relationships in in the beginning was like um basically the only kind of women that i could really feel myself attracted too were um 

151.41 165.96 A: i don't know they they weren't stable they was like more like the whores and the and all that stuff you know the women in the bars that were loose and kind of stuff like that then the the the level of responsibility on my end was minimal 

157.00 158.07 B: really 

160.40 161.36 B: uh-huh 

165.81 166.99 B: yeah 

166.08 176.04 A: and and i and i it's like that the whole commitment thing they talk about like the [laughter] you know it's like he's a he's a he's he's got a problem with the commitment word 

169.10 169.95 B: (( mhm )) 

175.79 177.18 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

176.02 187.35 A: you know like i was probably the epitome of that you know what i'm saying and and it's like i long deep inside myself for a relationship that would last forever 

179.96 180.94 B: uh-huh 

187.03 187.95 B: (( mhm )) 

187.27 196.18 A: and i find myself looking for that but it's like the whole trust factor and stuff like that i just just you know can't do it 

195.92 204.62 B: yeah you know it's funny because of what you went through and my parents are together and i kind of share those same views as far as trust is concerned 

204.46 215.11 B: because not even so much of the divorce rate but because of all the things that go on now it's such a tasking you know relationships are a lot of work 

214.81 216.50 A: mhm 

215.64 219.14 B: and you put so much effort into them 

219.38 222.23 B: and sometimes you don't get out what you should 

222.64 228.54 B: and the two parties are always going to be concerned with who's gonna win this one 

222.69 223.48 A: (( yeah )) 

229.16 234.14 B: and how good how positive is that not that positive [laughter] 

233.77 238.70 A: so when when you grew up were you a single child or did you have did you have siblings 

238.12 241.40 B: i have one sibling and we we're only two years apart 

239.42 240.17 A: yeah 

241.03 252.78 A: yeah yeah so like do you remember waking up like [mn] like you would fight with your brother or your sister whoever it was when you guys are like scrapping you you hated each other you didn't want to see each other leave me alone 

241.48 242.32 B: so 

252.80 258.11 A: you know and then and then there's like the next day you'd wake up 

252.85 254.16 B: oh sure 

258.25 260.94 A: and you'd look at each other and say well what are we gonna do today 

261.31 263.09 B: true as children 

261.81 262.82 A: did did 

262.85 264.64 A: did you ever have that happen 

264.15 268.57 B: as children [laughter] yeah a- as children 

265.24 267.02 A: yeah yeah 

267.14 268.06 A: and so 

268.45 274.85 A: so it's like here we are children i remember m- my brother and i were close sixteen months apart we're fighting you know it was like 

274.62 286.12 A: we had this big thing going on and then the next day we wake up and we kind of like wake up next you know it's like well what are what are we gonna do today i don't know let's go you know and out the door we went and and and that's kind of the way it was 

286.17 293.26 A: most of the time we got along but you know in in the family unit it's like the husband and the wife 

287.87 288.81 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

293.80 297.36 A: it wasn't like that it wasn't like well what are we gonna do today 

296.96 301.28 B: and role models are so drastically important 

300.52 313.75 A: it was like more like you know i hate your guts get out of here you you know scumbag [laughter] you know and all that stuff you know you filthy bitch and and back and forth and and and and not that that unconditional love 

305.14 306.43 B: [mn] uh-huh 

308.28 309.17 B: [laughter] 

309.86 310.81 B: uh-huh 

313.71 318.17 A: that i felt when i was a a a a young kid with my brother or my sister 

317.85 329.59 B: well i think even now with children not even going through what you're talking about it's so you know people think that divorces are just another option 

330.31 342.76 B: and they very seldom think of the consequences that go with that you know i see you you see me we like each other for a year we have kids hey maybe we'll make it maybe we won't 

342.49 343.24 A: (( yeah mm )) 

342.77 347.21 B: and there's so much more to it than maybe we'll make it maybe we won't you know 

347.16 348.07 A: (( so [mn] )) 

347.42 358.79 B: and you can't go into that with those views and i think that's what happens now people go into it thinking well if it don't work we'll get a divorce it's not but that's that's just not it that's just not it at all 

358.83 364.89 A: so the divorce rate and stuff like that that's going on has changed our family values has changed our personal values 

359.03 360.24 B: it is a 

363.29 364.12 B: oh no 

364.31 366.27 B: oh no doubt about it 

365.62 370.50 A: that you know we just go and do it and say well if it works it works and if it doesn't well fine and and 

369.40 383.91 B: well i think that's what most people do but since i see that since i'm thirty plus and i see so many people getting married and that's the case i feel much stronger now that if i should meet someone then it definitely will not be that way 

384.34 388.22 A: yeah it's that's that's if you want to find the right one th- th- th- the right person 

384.89 385.91 B: you see 

386.81 396.81 B: oh no doubt about it no doubt about it and to really think about this decision as the most important decision in my life that is not transferable 

396.80 399.49 A: so like when you go out or or when you 

399.54 406.85 A: when you like [mn] you know like when like are you in a relationship now or or when was the last time you were in a relationship yeah 

406.56 415.28 B: well it's been a while since i've been in a relationship but i found that it's so hard for one 

415.31 416.77 B: to get together 

417.24 420.28 B: you know [mn] you know as you get older it gets harder 

420.40 429.94 B: you know it's not as cute anymore the innocence isn't there and so you can basically you know and and it's hard to find a man who's thirty plus that does not have children 

430.44 436.57 B: and having to take that into effect which is a lot and i'm sure men say the same thing you know mhm 

433.20 434.29 A: (( yeah [mn] or )) 

435.14 436.42 A: exactly 

436.43 449.69 A: you know and and and i've over overcome that personally in myself you know that i [mn] i'll never be with a woman that has kids all that extra baggage the other man in her life that she's divorced now she got the she divorced him 

448.36 451.32 B: and they just never leave it just never leaves 

449.81 461.72 A: you know what's it gonna be like you know so he's always in the picture there's all this stuff going on i s- you know and so now it's like i've gotten to the point in my life where where i i would be willing to accept a woman into my life 

453.26 454.52 B: right 

461.55 471.78 A: that has a kid because like i am older i'm more mature and i've you know come to an understanding within myself you know that i i i love myself more but you know 

470.81 476.41 B: i'm older and i'm mature too but i i don't know if i'd consider that [laughter] [laughter] 

474.43 480.09 A: yeah but see well see you know [mn] you said you were like thirty plus you know it's like i i'm forty five now 

478.14 479.34 B: right 

479.98 481.49 B: right 

480.54 486.79 A: so [laughter] so i mean it's like you know i take that into consideration and where am i at now you know 

485.63 500.53 B: right and and you know i take it into consideration too but it still is a lot honestly speaking it still is a lot and um i don't have kids so i i mean if i had children and he had children then it would be oh you know what i mean 

489.53 491.30 A: yeah yeah it is 

492.76 493.57 A: yeah 

500.73 514.18 A: yeah the brady bunch kind of buzz and i've got friends like that you know that that are like he's got kids she's got kids let's get together and we're together and so it's gonna we're just gonna like live this life out god's gonna take care of us it's going to be okay 

501.04 503.13 B: but it's hard 

505.69 506.68 B: you know 

513.91 515.41 B: right 

514.25 523.43 A: [laughter] you know and like myself not having kids you know and and so like i would look for a woman in my sense l- like that was like you 

523.42 524.51 B: right 

524.04 534.63 A: you know that was still able to have kids if she wanted to have kids maybe but doesn't have kids but you know it's like there's it's not like that because like most of the women that i see already have kids and are divorced 

534.09 535.48 B: exactly 

534.85 536.51 A: you know that are older [mn] 

535.92 539.70 B: and it's bad enough getting old and having emotional baggage 

539.47 540.43 A: mhm 

539.72 542.72 B: but the physical is also a lot too 

542.87 548.42 A: so how does how does the divorce rate thing you know how do you think that's gonna affect 

548.84 551.91 A: us as a society or as a nation 

552.21 553.84 A: in the future [mn] 

552.27 566.76 B: i think i think most people are not like myself not saying that i'm so great but i think that most people think that marriage is something you can go in and get out of i don't think that most people take it as seriously as they should 

562.58 563.29 A: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

566.80 569.10 B: and i don't think that people 

568.96 572.53 B: because of how things are now really invest the time 

572.39 585.22 B: to investigate it not only that other person but themselves you know and and they just don't take the time to do that because they're looking at the numbers and they're looking at it and it's like di- 

587.02 599.89 B: are you there i'm sorry it's it's it's like divorce is so optional for them they really think that it is an option to be divorced it's an either or it's a button you press it's something that happens and you know 

587.09 587.97 A: hello 

588.39 589.70 A: (( yeah i'm all right ))
