173.36 178.51 B: [lipsmack] yeah um i know that ev- that every job that i've been in they've tested for drugs so 

178.72 181.99 B: yeah that's that's a stipulation of getting hired [sigh] 

181.85 182.73 A: (( you know [noise] )) 

182.04 184.38 B: you know and 

182.77 191.25 A: (( mm let let let me ask you to tackle this ah do you feel that drug use is highest among men ))

202.87 207.77 B: [sigh] i'd say it's a peer pressure thing gotta look cool gotta look cool 

205.33 206.41 A: peer pressure 

207.59 209.16 A: (( okay [noise] )) 

208.46 209.38 B: (( [sigh] you know )) 

209.51 214.68 A: eh ah i think the girls are catching up [laughter] [laughter] 

212.54 218.95 B: [noise] [laughter] hell i think there's some out there but i still think i still think over- overwhelmingly it's 

218.83 231.90 B: it's it's a guy thing and you know it's the same with alcohol you know the guys got you know they like doing this stuff 'cause they gotta look [sigh] they gotta look a certain way and they think that this could project an image that's gonna make them cool or 

220.72 221.68 A: uh-huh 

227.85 228.93 A: right 

231.82 234.69 B: give them respect or something like that and it it 

234.83 236.71 B: [sigh] you know it's [noise] 

235.41 236.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

236.49 240.86 A: mm yeah do do you think i don't know do they i think they asked the question 

240.89 246.50 A: ah is it a violation of one's privacy to test for drugs 

246.36 250.06 B: [sigh] oh no [laughter] if you don't wanna work then ah 

250.16 256.61 B: you know you might as well not go and apply for the job so [laughter] if you don't want a test then you might not want to go and work so 

256.44 258.22 A: [noise] right right right 

257.23 258.37 B: i mean that's 

258.82 260.18 A: (( [noise] ah yeah )) 

258.89 260.38 B: (( you know that's [noise] )) 

260.70 269.70 A: yeah my my take on that is i i i am in agreement with you [noise] ah it's not a violation of one's privacy because when you hire a person 

269.65 276.74 A: if that person is a drug user then that that problem will become the company's problem 

276.31 277.55 B: mhm 

276.51 288.17 A: because of poor performance or maybe getting hurt on the job [sigh] uh maybe from yeah i- if if the person owes someone some money a hitman comes to the job and putting other people's life in jeopardy you know 

281.01 281.97 B: (( uh-huh )) 

288.00 293.33 A: so it go it go beyond a a drug use go beyond the person using the drug 

288.09 289.49 B: (( [noise] yep )) 

293.58 294.99 B: most definitely 

294.98 297.30 A: go beyond that so it's not a 

297.40 302.27 A: i don't feel like a like a test for someone for drugs it would be invading 

302.29 304.30 A: that person's privacy 

303.34 305.11 B: (( [noise] [mn] yep [mn] )) 

304.56 309.69 A: um because they're damaging not only themselves but their loved ones and friends and everyone else 

308.86 318.13 B: mhm yeah they're making it everybody else's problem once they once they do something that [sigh] that injures somebody else or you know kills them you know that's 

316.91 317.79 A: right 

319.92 321.38 A: yeah that that is true 

319.95 324.93 B: [sigh] yeah i i don't think it's i don't think it's anything of an invasion of privacy 

324.77 326.15 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

326.89 330.84 A: (( yeah yeah i wonder wa- was there another question that they asked )) 

331.50 341.56 B: i'm not for sure what the other one was [sigh] my phone was kinda my phone was kinda cutting out but [sigh] i think it was just uh- the first one and that one that you just brought up so 

333.58 334.90 A: i'm not either 

336.80 337.58 A: uh-huh 

340.68 341.44 A: (( mhm ))

459.74 461.77 A: right right 

462.05 464.49 B: (( and i ah you know i personally [sigh] )) 

464.48 477.78 B: personally i didn't ah i didn't think what they did was right because i know that they fired some other people for little things you know they were you know almost ki- you know hurting themselves but they [sigh] you know there was no drugs involved but you know [lipsmack] 

474.32 475.14 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

478.12 483.89 B: there's just a lot of people protected so and ah you find that and i guess you find that in certain jobs

500.05 510.87 B: i don't i don't think they should be doing that [laughter] tell you the truth it- it's you know it's just kinda giving permission to smoke you know and get high [noise] and 

507.81 508.75 A: right 

510.04 511.02 A: right 

511.03 519.32 B: you know and if that was the case they better be doing it in a [noise] controlled area where they're being watched for that [noise] time while they're doing it you [noise] know in a [noise] hospital setting 

516.33 517.22 A: (( uh-huh )) 

519.36 522.54 B: and you know they're not going to leave until after that you know 

522.65 527.13 B: [noise] but they shouldn't be trying to legalize it [sigh] that's that's ah
