408.91 422.07 B: she was applying for jobs and she would have to put that down and in a way it's detrimental to say okay i had this surgery and i'm on these drugs 'cause they may just discriminate on the fact oop we don't want somebody working here that's you know 

421.97 426.87 B: their brain [laughter] that but when she'd be tested she'd have to 

423.03 424.44 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

427.34 436.58 B: you know 'cause she was working like for stock brokerage firms and you know more you know like corporate america where they definitely test everybody [noise]

496.58 509.53 B: i find that a little wrong because they're saying okay well you know if you're given a probation or you've learned your lesson or given a fine and yet it's still held against you if the criminal record follows you for life 

507.01 508.02 A: right
