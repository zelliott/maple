38.44 50.61 B: for me uh i don't have any problem you know of uh if you have a business and you uh want to have ah any good business you have to make sure that you have the right people working with you 

41.24 42.21 A: yeah 

50.44 53.27 A: that's true that's true i i agree i agree with you 

51.33 52.54 B: um 

53.34 56.61 B: so if if if you want to work with um

59.48 60.33 A: yeah

65.31 66.68 B: i mean you can 

67.47 72.13 B: you can say no you have to uh do what they uh ask you to do 

69.52 70.37 A: right 

72.13 83.21 A: you know what i tell you i i agree what you saying i think that they should be tested um because if you under the influence of drugs there's a possibility that that that somebody's life may be in danger or something like that 

82.26 83.59 B: (( uh uh-huh )) 

83.18 95.89 A: you know so i i definitely agree with that but at the same time i do kinda feel it's an invasion of privacy so it's kinda a it's kinda a catch twenty two situation you know but uh just taking the lesser of the two evils i guess it's something that has to be done 

95.99 106.47 A: um i work for uh myself i'm a subcontractor and um they test us um they spot test us every once in a while so i i mean i have no problem with it 

106.41 112.89 A: you know just 'cause i know some guys work they were working they were under the influence of marijuana few was under the influence of cocaine 

111.82 114.20 B: mhm 

112.89 120.29 A: and they um they they screwed the job up and i had to go in uh one night and um and redo all that work 'cause these guys were 

119.31 120.27 B: mhm 

120.15 131.24 A: were screwed up so i definitely feel that that they should uh testing should be done um spontaneously and without without um any expectation or without notice you know what i'm saying 

130.11 131.38 B: (( exactly )) 

131.98 133.94 B: the only thing that i would um 

134.84 137.57 B: consider um wrong is that 

137.59 141.56 B: probably there are many people who have drug issues 

141.86 143.13 B: um 

143.16 150.89 B: because that they can't get a job and and and they uh in some ways if er um 

150.90 157.30 B: if um company don't don't give them opportunity to 

157.73 160.51 B: to be um productive you know 

160.16 164.97 A: yeah you should get a second chance yeah i i i agree with you on that yes kinda like yeah 

161.96 162.81 B: (( exactly )) 

163.67 167.75 B: probably that's that's the only thing i would i would um 

168.21 176.27 B: object about drug testing you know i was working uh 'til one month ago in a drugs um in a drug 

170.39 171.47 A: yeah 

177.27 178.21 B: um 

178.53 182.85 B: program um i was a um 

183.30 187.13 B: the a kind of the director of the program 

187.27 190.33 B: and um you hear 

190.95 194.62 B: these stories all the time people who want to 

193.55 195.13 A: right that's true 

194.78 198.96 B: get a job and they can't get a job because they are drugs 

198.93 200.16 A: yeah 

199.13 201.08 B: yeah taking drugs 

201.71 212.35 A: well i tell you i was in the navy for six years and they used to check us spontaneously also they they caught a few guys out there that were using coke and uh i was in a submarine and i'm gonna tell you [noise] man 

209.05 209.86 B: (( oh )) 

212.32 217.99 A: ((  )) 

213.73 214.58 B: (( no problem )) 

219.91 221.03 A: i'm sorry 

220.80 222.42 B: ah no problem 

221.67 224.44 A: you know i got the kids here they get a little stupid i gotta let them know 

224.52 235.59 A: um yeah um they a couple of gu- well i was about to say again you know i was on a submarine and um it got a little you know that was really dangerous there was so many things that could go wrong so we want to make sure everybody was 

224.65 225.44 B: (( [laughter] )) 

235.43 249.21 A: was basically up to par and they were sharp and they you know their minds were sharp and everything it was you could make one mistake you could kill everybody yeah one we had one guy pushed the wrong button one time on a hertz um hertz uh power which powered some of the um um 

241.85 242.71 B: wow 

249.19 250.63 A: i forget what it powered 

250.76 251.46 B: (( uh-huh )) 

250.79 263.06 A: and it knocked out our power we were we were we were adrift out at sea we had to operating under water you might of flooded might not been able to got back up and we had backups also but i mean it was pretty it's pretty dangerous so i mean 

262.09 264.18 B: yeah it's risky 

262.83 275.43 A: definitely definitely should be tested no doubt about it you know no doubt about it but at the same time if you make a mistake i think you should be given an opportunity at least once as a minimum to rectify and say well i made a mistake 

275.26 287.16 A: that um i won't do it again and even if you fall off twice you know i people should be given a chance you know i don't think it's fair we're human we we err we make we make mistakes we sin so there's nothing we can do about it it's just the ones that got 

278.57 280.05 B: (( mhm yeah exactly )) 

287.27 289.15 A: are the ones that got in trouble 

289.27 294.51 B: i'm i'm probably the if you uh the first time you are applying to that job 

294.53 299.37 B: the the company should be um i mean the company had 

300.17 307.54 B: some kind of social responsibility to pull this guy and uh warn him i don't know kind of 

307.57 312.37 B: okay go to program and show us that you are clean and apply again 

311.54 312.10 A: (( [mn] )) 

312.11 315.55 A: (( right okay all right uh i i un- ))

321.51 324.12 B: (( that's uh i mean )) 

324.44 335.68 A: yeah i tell you this drug drug problem is so is so rampant now i mean actually with the neighborhood i i just recently moved back to new york city ma- matter of fact wh- wh- where you calling from as a matter of fact i was always at 

325.43 326.66 B: um 

334.56 336.01 B: (( new york )) 

336.20 337.65 A: pa- pardon me 

337.59 339.15 B: i'm here in new york 

338.90 340.34 A: oh you in new york also 

340.02 341.02 B: yes 

340.66 348.99 A: oh cool cool yeah the last person i talked to was in chicago but um i tell you man here in new york it's so it's so much out here it's just ridiculous 

348.86 356.25 A: (( um hold on a second i'm gonna tell you right now this is the last time i tell you i hear a a a voice raised again you're both getting out of here )) 

356.32 359.91 A: (( try me again i'm on a business call )) 

361.50 365.19 A: (( these kids are crazy man um yeah )) 

364.02 366.11 B: (( [mn] where did where did you work before )) 

365.78 372.05 A: yeah it's it's it's it's bad man it's just so much stuff out here man it's like it's around you every day 

371.85 383.54 A: and i guess the temptations kinda ge- overwhelm people but the thing is if you know you got something to do and you know that that that drug use could possibly harm yourself and your body to the work that you're doing 

383.31 387.70 A: you need to kinda just say no or just not even work at the job 

387.58 388.79 B: mhm 

387.63 398.58 A: you know you got people working around machinery around high pressure air you know pneumatics pneumatic drills or high pressure air like you know we had a we had a incident aboard a submarine one time where 

399.04 406.13 A: we had a high pressure air link and the pressure in that particular line was like five thousand no i think it was like three thousand psi 

406.48 416.70 A: so i heard it when it popped and you could hear the air coming out but you couldn't see it so the guy was gonna stick his hand in the where the valve was had to cut it off so i grabbed him before he put his hand in there 'cause 

407.28 408.03 B: yeah 

410.97 411.67 B: (( oh )) 

416.55 422.60 A: that air would of took his hand right off it was would've been like fire burning and his hand would've been gone so 

418.43 419.37 B: uh-huh 

422.42 433.98 A: you know in that case you got to know where to isolate it from from other areas and what not but they say the guy was drunk and it just happened to stick his hand in there do something stupid he would of lost his life he would of lost his hand at least 

428.97 429.79 B: (( mm )) 

434.09 439.75 A: you know so i mean it it's very it's very you know important that these people realize that you know 

439.52 444.22 A: first of all using drugs it it messes your brain up anyway i don't like it but i smoked marijuana 

442.47 443.31 B: yeah 

444.18 447.79 A: i used to years ago i don't get messing around on that stuff i might drink occasionally 

447.77 462.77 A: and i won't drink if i know i'm going to work i mean i had to go to work this morning this guy pressing offering me a drink i didn't drink now that i'm off i may having a drink you know so i don't i don't see what i don't understand what people are really thinking about when they when they know they using drugs and they know it's a possibility that their mind might not be sharp 

450.26 450.91 B: (( uh-huh )) 

453.60 455.42 B: mhm 

462.59 464.94 A: i don't get it i really don't 

465.09 475.37 B: but you never never ever have a problem with you i mean [mn] um bad feeling when you are requested um for drug testing 

475.59 477.57 A: ah i do kinda feel 

477.71 483.46 A: it's an invasion of my privacy but at the same time i understand it's something that's necessary 

483.46 484.62 B: (( mhm )) 

484.01 486.06 A: (( you know it is necessary )) 

485.85 499.17 A: um i have a friend that's a truck driver and they test them every on- he he gets tested every once in a while you get a guy that's out you know getting high on on coke or smoking marijuana or you know he's driving this big rig 

495.98 496.88 B: uh-huh 

499.05 512.39 A: you know sixty five seventy eighty miles an hour on a highway man you could hurt some you could kill somebody so i mean i mean in a case like that i think the the results re- uh outweigh the the inconveniences you know what i'm saying 

502.83 503.70 B: well 

511.75 512.80 B: uh-huh 

512.98 518.65 A: so i definitely i definitely feel it's just something that's that's that's necessary it really really is 

518.79 519.69 A: (( you know )) 

518.86 522.91 B: i totally agree uh i just have been tested once 

523.16 526.08 B: and for me there was nothing i mean 

526.23 533.15 B: i think if you are clean you don't have to worry [laughter] about it that's about right i think the people who are against 

530.97 533.86 A: (( yeah that's it if you're clean you don't have to worry yeah )) 

533.69 535.47 B: against uh um 

535.98 540.06 B: drug testing it's because they have something to uh 

540.61 543.45 B: (( to hide they have to hid it i don't know to to mhm mhm )) 

542.90 557.65 A: yeah and then it's illegal on top of it you know you're doing something illegal so i mean why i mean if you're gonna do if you're gonna do something do something but don't jeopardize other people's lives in the process that's the way i feel you see if you work in a job 

558.22 562.75 A: and you you're risking somebody's life or you're risking somebody's livelihood 

562.92 566.78 A: you know let's say if you work in corporate america and and and they testing you and you 

566.58 580.47 A: make a mistake on a on a contract or or a transaction that you made your mind is not sharp you costing this company a lot of money so that's their livelihood i i can i can i can definitely understand that you know obviously having a drink after work 

580.26 592.78 A: you know i don't think there's anything wrong with that and they're smoking the marijuana and all that stuff there i mean you know i i don't think i don't think that's i don't think that's right and it and it is illegal so i mean you suffer the consequences that's just so- some of the 

592.77 597.21 A: little things that we have to put up with being citizens here and i think it's for the i think it's for the 

597.28 599.95 A: for the overall wellbeing of of of the uh people
