145.25 146.63 A: well that's nice 

146.22 160.48 B: yeah uh it was ki- kind of a miserable winter because it was constantly just right out freezing or just below but uh it never got down like you guys you know ten below or anything like that but it was sitting right at twenty eight twenty nine degrees almost every night so it was kind of like 

153.11 153.96 A: right 

159.07 165.43 A: oh it was horrible so that limited my uh i wasn't about to go out walking when it's twelve below zero you know what i mean [laughter] 

160.48 161.72 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

164.68 175.12 B: i un- i understand perfectly [laughter] yeah so do you uh uh other than your physical therapy uh before you broke your arm did you do any kind of exercising like that or 

174.97 182.25 A: not really you know i was i was working retail myself so i was on my feet all day and that kind of stuff so 

176.24 176.99 B: no

180.75 181.78 B: oh yeah 

182.48 192.76 A: i real didn't really do too much other than that you know just like i said during the spring and summer i'd go out and do you know walk around the block or something just to get outside and enjoy the weather 

182.72 183.84 B: yeah 

192.49 195.29 B: yeah it it well you know there's uh 

195.39 197.35 B: certain amount of energy or um 

197.66 201.57 B: exercises you know therapy type stuff i mean not therapy but uh 

202.13 206.07 B: uh heart you know healthy stuff when you do walking and stuff 

205.59 207.25 A: exactly gets the 

207.12 207.76 B: (( you know )) 

207.58 209.55 A: the cardio rate up there 

207.98 208.65 B: (( but )) 

209.27 213.30 B: you know right exactly and if if you don't stroll you need to walk a little bit i guess [laughter] 

212.47 214.22 A: exactly 

213.80 216.40 B: [laughter] yeah but i was uh 

216.55 222.68 B: i feel like i i do a lot of exercise during the day so i um by the time i get home i'm ready to sit down and relax a little while 

222.15 226.00 A: right it's like i need to take it easy now [laughter] i'm worn out from the day 

223.03 223.71 B: (( [laughter] )) 

224.26 225.35 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

225.72 227.63 B: yeah yeah 

226.94 235.15 A: so yeah i've thought about joining the gym a couple of times and i'm like am i really going to go there i'm going to spend that money and for what never go you know [laughter] 

235.10 238.03 B: yeah that's my idea that it's um 

236.01 237.10 A: [laughter] 

238.23 242.35 B: the the gym i just don't have time to go anywhere you know extra like that at all 

241.91 243.06 A: right 

242.47 245.47 B: so so i i knew i would be wasting my time there 

245.50 248.65 B: but uh i i well when i first got this machine 

248.90 251.37 B: uh it's a cardio something 

251.41 258.48 B: but it's one of those uh where you pull you know you sit on the seat and you pull your own weight and you lift it up and it's got several like ten different settings or something 

257.89 258.97 A: okay 

258.54 265.86 B: and i was amazed the first time i got on it i couldn't do three minutes at the lowest setting and i thought you know i'm in better shape than this 

263.29 264.19 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

264.93 267.98 A: [laughter] it's like wait a minute something's wrong here [laughter] 

266.65 273.33 B: [noise] yeah [laughter] and i finally got so i could do the ten minutes you know they that's what they recommend without too much trouble then i thought 

272.48 273.78 A: right 

273.36 276.03 B: now well let me go up a notch you know [laughter] 

275.18 276.55 A: mhm 

276.14 285.18 B: but i i actually i don't do that as often as i should because by the time i get home my legs are tired and i'm ready to sit down and relax and by the time i'm relaxed then i don't want to get back up again so 

276.63 277.52 A: it's a 

282.04 283.40 A: right 

284.88 291.86 A: yeah but it's amazing when you think about it when you actually start to do something like that you're like man i should be able to do this what's the matter with me 

290.72 297.50 B: yeah [laughter] yeah actually the first time i got on it i couldn't put three minutes on and i thought oh no this is something wrong here you know 

295.82 300.65 A: [laughter] it's like i should be able to do this easy what's the matter with this [laughter] 

299.43 313.73 B: [laughter] yeah what you know i'm just lifting my own weight a few times you know that that can't be that bad but you know it it was amazing how how difficult it was to begin with but you know it didn't take but just three or four weeks and i was able to you know on a regular basis where i could get down pretty quickly 

304.38 305.40 A: right 

313.45 320.10 A: right yeah and then you got to be careful when you're doing exercise like that too you don't want to start too fast or you know you get yourself hurt too 

313.90 315.21 B: and then 

318.96 319.99 B: yeah 

320.05 326.04 B: yeah i didn't i didn't jump into it real hard if i got tired i just you know quit you know i i worked my way into it you know but 

325.34 326.38 A: right 

326.04 337.68 B: i then uh it i went through a spell where i wasn't able to do it for a while like when i got back on it i was able to get back up to the ten minutes within couple of days which ki- kinda surprised me you know that it came back that quickly 

334.10 335.04 A: okay 

336.98 338.38 A: right 

337.78 342.87 B: you know but uh i think a lot of it is breathing as well as the lifting and things like 

341.48 342.88 A: exactly 

342.90 348.96 B: that but i find most exercises are boring and i think that's why most people don't do 'em very long 

348.38 354.81 A: i know like lifting weights and stuff like that to me it's like boy this is exciting whoop de do da [laughter] you know 

353.08 354.22 B: yeah [laughter] 

354.33 361.65 B: yeah i did that with my brother in law and uh coupla friends and i did that we were just about two years we'd go out twice or three times a week and lift weights 

361.57 370.71 B: uh we had uh a machine you know one of those gym machines where you could you didn't have to physically lift the the barbell type thing but it was it was on pulleys and chains and all that kind of stuff 

366.62 367.58 A: right 

370.35 371.43 A: right 

370.78 377.06 B: but uh you know when you got four five people there it's not too bad because then you talk about it and you know a little competition that's not bad 

376.10 379.18 A: yeah you can sort of interact with people and 

378.09 385.52 B: [laughter] yeah but just to sit down and say well i got a fifteen minutes of workout you know in front of me here and there's nobody to but me to do it 

384.56 387.96 A: [noise] there's just me and this steel here all right this is fun 

385.83 386.39 B: (( [mn] )) 

386.71 392.19 B: yeah [laughter] you know yeah i won- yeah i wonder what this all really leads to you know [laughter] 

391.26 392.90 A: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

392.58 393.46 B: (( yeah so )) 

393.27 396.02 A: kinda like this is boring is it over yet [laughter] all 

394.84 395.70 B: yeah 

395.91 403.61 B: yeah that's exactly right you know i've i've seen people who ride their bicycle you know a stationary bicycle in front of the t._v. or read a book and that kind of stuff 

403.11 404.38 A: right 

403.79 409.24 B: and i've often wondered you know does that really do anything they're not concentrating they're probably going at a slow rate 

408.86 410.04 A: probably 

409.81 414.57 B: yeah so [lipsmack] so you know but maybe they're doing more than i am so who knows [laughter] 

413.54 420.41 A: yeah now you you see some of these gyms they got all that stuff there they got the t._v.s right in front of the bike and all that kind of stuff but 

419.03 419.75 B: yeah 

419.81 430.87 B: yeah yeah for one reason because people get bored you know even even if you go to a gym you have to have something to occupy you know something to you know either occupy your time and keep you from getting bored or something to drive you on you know 

422.20 423.55 A: (( exactly [mn] )) 

430.18 431.51 A: right 

430.93 436.81 B: and if you don't go with someone for a little competition you know then it i think most people quit because it's just boring [noise] 

436.22 442.88 A: right unless you take one of those classes or something like that but then you got to dedicate the time to do that because those classes are 

440.99 451.96 B: yeah yeah yeah i i wouldn't mind taking one of one of those aerobic classes when you know with the one of those young girls that teaches you know but i probably couldn't keep [laughter] probably couldn't keep up with her [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

446.52 447.67 A: [laughter] 

447.73 448.72 A: [laughter] 

449.20 454.16 A: that makes it exciting [laughter] you drop on the floor from exhaustion [laughter] 

453.02 455.46 B: yeah get my heart rate going anyway right 

454.60 456.80 A: (( that's right [laughter] )) 

455.80 462.40 B: but what i'd have to do is ask her are you uh uh trained in mouth to mouth resuscitation or something [laughter] [mn] 

459.82 463.63 A: [laughter] [laughter] can you save me if i die 

462.69 466.48 B: yeah yeah exactly [laughter] [mn] 

466.63 470.08 B: one of our uh radio announcers here uh locally 

470.15 473.22 B: him and his uh cohort on on the radio they were 

473.03 486.85 B: taking um had a personal trainer they were going to a gym and they had a personal trainer working with 'em and every day they'd come in and give a report you know how she had tortured them the day before [laughter] and they the the third person on the on the st- uh 

477.10 478.01 A: right 

481.27 482.96 A: [laughter] 

486.75 495.86 B: radio there is a lady and she said well why do you keep going back and they keep saying well she looks so good and she's going to make us look good [laughter] you know but she tortures us she's trying us kill us you know

497.91 500.65 B: works us hard yeah um but 

499.59 501.54 A: oh my goodness 

502.13 507.88 B: i've just never uh never had the ti- time really to go uh well i shouldn't say never but 

508.07 519.79 B: recently anyway i've never had the time to go in and spend thirty minutes or an hour at a gym you know even if you go in for thirty minutes it takes you thirty minutes to get there and thirty minutes to come home you're talking about hour and a half two hours to do the thirty or forty minutes worth of workout [mn] 

519.05 524.45 A: [noise] exactly and you you know you got to get changed and shower and 

523.87 529.52 B: exactly you know and it just it just takes so much time to do so you know just that one little activity 

528.97 530.39 A: right 

529.84 533.61 B: you know that you know i just say well i'll just do something different you know [laughter] 

532.59 538.35 A: and then you're like am i really accomplishing anything and then they want you to get a personal trainer which means they make more money 

536.86 537.70 B: yeah 

538.03 539.66 B: yeah exactly yeah 

538.91 540.87 A: that's basically what that means 

540.60 550.94 B: yeah [laughter] yeah so it just a never ending battle but you know i i i do think that most americans probably should exercise more i know i should but uh you know 

547.52 548.57 A: right 

550.09 553.64 A: yeah 'cause america's are very seden- sedentary society
