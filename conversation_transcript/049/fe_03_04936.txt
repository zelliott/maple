50.34 52.30 B: (( [noise] i )) 

52.37 64.35 B: don't know i think it's about fifty percent level i i think that's mostly in the u. s. it's what the statistics that i read i don't think it's as bad around the world as it is in the u. s. i think it's just a greedy country 

64.39 66.97 A: yeah i think it is higher here than other places 

65.72 69.29 B: (( [laughter] i don't know how to say it ))

81.15 82.73 B: uh 

83.51 85.85 B: i'm willing to get married but uh 

86.06 88.40 B: seems that people are very independent today 

88.79 90.04 B: i don't know 

89.72 95.16 A: yeah that's true especially women are more independent than they were in the past 

94.51 96.68 B: yeah i think that's what it is 

96.69 97.71 B: uh 

98.15 101.59 B: i don't know it's hard to put in words 

102.00 103.71 B: (( i don't know if it's uh )) 

105.65 113.90 B: [sigh] i don't know what marriage is i know i'm fortunate enough to know marriages that have worked for a long time and uh 

114.50 116.06 B: i see 

116.60 119.07 B: i see how it works uh 

119.84 125.15 B: i don't know i ask 'em i ask older people uh that have made it work who've 

125.22 127.27 B: [mn] stuck together and they uh 

128.13 130.53 B: they're generally uh 

132.02 134.65 B: they don't think too much they say um 

135.56 137.82 B: my buddy's mom says that uh 

138.21 145.56 B: there's a certain amount of vinegar [laughter] to i guess to life so that's marriage i mean 

145.74 148.06 B: i didn't really sp- specify with 

148.37 153.25 B: marriage but uh i asked her about life and she said there's a certain amount of vinegar and uh 

154.01 161.43 B: they she in particular they walk a lot and they're in their eighties and they've been married about sixty years 

157.67 158.97 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

161.28 162.34 A: (( [mn] wow )) 

162.02 163.68 B: yeah so 

163.72 166.18 B: it can work it i 

166.48 167.94 B: [mn] there's a certain i 

168.54 170.91 B: it's a certain amount of anger or something 

171.51 176.57 B: i don't know what i don't know how to say it uh they walk on the opposite side of the road a lot they walk out in tr- 

177.73 182.41 B: [noise] they walk out in traffic and uh they been 

182.61 188.27 B: lucky enough to s- you know not get hit and s- and stay together and everything they have a big family 

188.38 188.94 A: (( [laughter] )) 

188.83 190.57 B: but then i see uh 

191.23 193.79 B: other sides of the ballpark where uh 

194.54 195.57 B: people 

197.59 207.07 B: [noise] it seems like they just don't want to uh make it work i think that's what it is if you want to make it work it'll work you know that if you have a goal 

207.63 211.01 B: i i it's probably sad to say but i think a lot of people just don't [mn] 

211.80 214.27 B: have goals or high standards 

214.47 216.47 B: [noise] i don't know what it is 

216.68 219.58 B: i have the distinct 

221.27 222.35 B: uh 

222.51 231.30 B: my mom was first in her class so and my my mom and dad were opposites but they're they're fi- their ma- their marriage lasted like forty years but uh 

227.38 228.84 A: (( mm mm )) 

231.15 232.04 A: (( wow )) 

231.45 243.27 B: my m- yeah my mom was first in her class in a catholic school and my father and my mom was k- kind of average in common while my father came from a fairly wealthy family and uh 

243.77 253.25 B: they took him out of school when he was young like in seventh grade my father so he was i mean he wasn't stupid but he certainly wasn't educated by any standards 

253.36 257.28 B: so he started uh working for his father when he was fourteen 

257.70 260.50 B: so he wasn't educated my mom was uh 

260.63 263.54 B: you know had all the brains and everything and uh 

263.72 272.35 B: they somehow got together and they lasted about forty years and uh yeah i don't you just never know [mn] it's it's stra- it seems like today that uh 

267.21 268.47 A: (( mm )) 

273.41 277.94 B: i don't know people squabble a lot and they there's a lot of space between people uh 

278.56 281.08 B: i prefer being close but uh 

281.48 290.76 B: it hasn't been [laughter] successful for me [laughter] i can't say that i've been successful at it you know i used to try to be close and then uh 

286.30 287.39 A: (( mm )) 

291.54 297.91 B: you know she used to tell me you know i was whipped and she didn't want me whipped and everything and i said i didn't know how to act 

297.95 299.18 B: 'cause when i was young 

301.48 310.33 B: [noise] when i was younger it it seemed to work being close to women and girls or whatever but then as i got older it seemed like uh 

310.67 314.74 B: they wanted their space so then i asked my buddy's parents again and uh 

315.95 321.78 B: i guess [sigh] there's something to be said for being close but yet doing 

322.14 330.25 B: activities without each other and doing activities with each other so i guess it has to be a happy medium i learned from my one boss he was saying 

329.98 330.80 A: (( [laughter] )) 

330.73 341.40 B: i don't know how to say it i thought by now that i would have like three or four kids and probably been married about you know ten years at least if not fifteen 

342.12 343.34 B: but uh 

344.12 344.68 B: (( [mn] )) 

344.87 350.45 B: who knows what normal is anymore i think normal to me anymore is 

352.26 357.28 B: [mn] you know somebody that's genuinely nice and uh 

356.43 357.92 A: mm mhm 

357.37 362.23 B: and and says stuff that they wouldn't mind people saying to them you know what i mean 

361.17 363.21 A: (( mm mhm )) 

362.60 364.74 B: 'cause nobody wants to hear 

365.56 372.65 B: something that they don't uh they don't like you know what i mean i was at work tonight and the people are coming in and uh 

373.04 385.90 B: you know i don't want to hear any negativity i certainl- [laughter] you know i i don't want to hear negati- i try not to be negative towards people but if they're going to be negative towards me it's it's kind of hard i as i've gotten older i don't even feel like dealing with 'em 

374.97 376.74 A: (( yeah mhm [laughter] mm )) 

385.25 386.34 A: (( [laughter] )) 

385.83 391.85 B: so what i [mn] well i either ignore 'em or or i override 'em i'll try to you know talk over 'em and uh 

392.37 398.05 B: you know say probably too much but when i was growing up and the way i was brought up was 

398.84 402.22 B: you know to try to vent the anger out and uh 

402.24 408.31 B: try to make friends with people who no matter [mn] who they are or what they are so hopefully 

408.57 412.03 B: if you have faith you know you you just keep going and uh 

412.16 417.80 B: people out here are you know they they understand but it seems like today that uh 

417.88 425.78 B: it's different uh people are so picky about words i guess i'm one of 'em i i guess as you get older you get more picky about words i don't know 

425.87 432.49 B: when i [mn] now i still feel like i'd rather be friendly and say the wrong thing to somebody 

432.54 442.28 B: than sit there and not say anything and be like a mutant and i know that that's like against corporate policy anymore in the corporate world like they'd rather you just shut your mouth and not 

442.43 443.94 B: say anything 

443.75 458.05 B: like if you're going to say the wrong thing then don't say anything at all but i still disagree with that because y- you're supposed to have faith and no no matter what it is whoever it is or whatever it is if it's an old shoe on the [laughter] side of the road that you praise 

457.97 461.64 B: or if it's god or whoever you know what i mean 

460.47 461.13 A: [laughter] 

461.42 462.34 A: (( yeah )) 

461.71 464.52 B: i think that you're supposed to have faith 

464.61 472.83 B: that if you're trying to be friendly and you're trying to be positive no matter even if you are negative 

473.22 483.26 B: then you'll get taken care of by something or somebody but today it seems like people don't want to hear anything negative and it's almost impossible because people get so 

483.29 488.67 B: many different viruses and and and c- corruption within the the people that they meet you know 

488.91 491.07 B: i'm at work tonight and uh [mn] 

491.59 497.70 B: i'm trying to help the kid out i'm working with and i'm like fifteen years older than him and i have a lot of experience more than him 

497.77 501.02 B: and i'm trying to be as nice as i can and you know [mn] 

501.60 502.77 B: you know 

502.90 513.93 B: [mn] very specific and [laughter] you know tell him where things are and what to do and how to get there and then all of a sudden i have this virus that i had like this number virus from last night that i had where 

513.96 519.78 B: i [mn] i i turn like dyslexic every once in a while and it happened last night where i had a uh 

519.84 521.87 B: address and it was uh 

521.87 536.46 B: sixteen twelve and i i went to sixteen twenty one [laughter] [laughter] then tonight he goes to twenty one oh four and i'm sending i'm sending him to sixteen oh four and the guy probably thinks i hated him and did it 

525.10 527.30 A: (( mm mm )) 

528.73 529.64 A: (( [laughter] )) 

533.13 534.70 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

536.28 538.52 B: (( vindictively you know what i mean )) 

538.01 539.09 A: (( [laughter] i know )) 

538.57 546.19 B: so i guess that's what happens in marriages i guess i guess if you do that to your wife and she thinks that you're really being vindictive and you're not 

545.57 546.85 A: (( mhm )) 

546.24 555.05 B: then i can probably destroy the whole marriage or the whole relationship or beginning of it one of my buddies i worked with recently told me that uh 

550.85 551.73 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

555.35 559.19 B: he was engaged for eleven years before he got married and then he got 

559.61 563.83 B: he got married eleven years later and it worked they just had a kid so 

559.68 560.56 A: wow 

563.77 564.33 A: (( [mn] )) 

563.93 566.76 B: it i i think it takes all different kinds 

566.56 567.93 A: mhm 

567.71 571.88 B: it [mn] [mn] everybody's different and maybe people meet and uh 

572.69 574.13 B: you know they 

574.17 585.40 B: they get married after two months but i think generally probably like i'd say like two or three or four excuse me two three four years probably would be the uh 

586.28 599.95 B: probably the minimal in a relationship today to make it work but you know what women get very frustrated and they want to rush into it seems marriage that's what i found they want to they want to rush into it but i think that 

594.83 595.84 A: (( mhm )) 

596.93 598.01 A: (( mhm ))
