1.60 2.71 A: hello 

1.93 5.68 B: hi [mn] hello i'm chip hamlet 

5.14 8.18 A: oh i'm paul armstrong [cough] 

9.31 13.19 B: what ah what do what do you think about that 

12.93 15.37 A: ah i tell you what man um 

16.33 22.88 A: an- anything that anybody can do to slow down the drugs [mn] i'm all for it and uh 

22.91 23.96 A: because 

25.51 27.55 A: everyone knows it's against the law 

28.29 33.92 A: everyone knows that you understand what i'm saying so it's like if you go on the job 

28.39 29.41 B: right 

35.53 44.27 A: uh the average person knows that most jobs do drug testing or they don't want their employees using drugs 

44.70 46.56 A: so um 

46.91 52.61 A: this is something i think [mn] should be a strong deterrent against people using drugs 

51.91 59.22 B: right and so it's kind of it it should be like common sense because the people know going into the job that they're gonna have to be tested so 

59.62 61.02 B: it's just uh 

61.13 63.82 B: it's ju- it's more of a personal decision 

63.74 65.50 A: yeah yeah 

64.60 69.05 B: yeah my my only quarrel with it is that it it seems like you know getting 

68.96 80.97 B: getting somebody i mean i'm sure you've had to take a drug test for for a job before but it is it is kinda demeaning to have to go to the bathroom in a cup for somebody you know while they while they stand in the bathroom with you you know 

81.54 85.62 A: yeah i i i imagine that can be [mn] 

86.40 89.23 A: yeah i i imagine that can be uh 

90.23 91.57 A: um 

93.29 96.60 A: rather dis- you know unpleasant you know ah

108.38 109.46 B: oh okay 

108.91 111.36 A: but before that 

112.23 115.75 A: i never had to take a drug test [mn] but uh 

116.06 116.86 A: i 

116.98 119.23 A: to be very honest with you 

119.28 128.47 A: i really i don't think i would mind it you know may may maybe if i you know maybe if i went in a stall you know so like you you know you know you know how you have the 

121.96 123.30 B: you don't think you would mind 

128.33 140.13 A: stalls in the bathroom or something like that you can go in a stall where you know maybe semi private and you can do it and [mn] and i don't i don't think i would mind it because see 

129.45 131.06 B: right right 

140.32 148.49 A: i know see now the different times i was on jobs okay while i was working for other people now i used to drive uh 

144.68 145.59 B: right 

148.50 160.13 A: tractor trailers over the road i was driving for the pepsi cola company you know hauling pepsi cola's this kinda thing and uh from time to time you had to ride with other people 

150.62 152.43 B: mhm 

159.81 160.84 B: right 

160.23 161.98 A: and man i'm telling you 

162.14 168.10 A: uh i there are times when your life is your life is actually in somebody else's hands 

167.87 169.82 B: right right 

168.68 170.16 A: and uh 

170.26 178.23 A: i i know for myself i was in one situation where a guy was driving a truck and this guy was on drugs 

178.13 179.33 B: oh wow 

179.07 190.65 A: you know and it's a scary thing when you see some things happening and he kept having uh different problems you know with his driving and so finally they hauled him in and gave him a drug test 

190.22 192.07 B: mhm 

190.76 192.84 A: okay and 

193.46 206.83 A: [sigh] he he wound up losing his job but at the same time if they had a done that let's say if they had a done it before uh before they hired him well the close call that we had probably never would've happened 

206.48 208.89 B: right it's a good point 

208.31 214.47 A: you know so i i don't i don't think i would mind it i and and because i mean you know 

214.72 215.87 A: um 

217.05 222.41 A: of course it of course you know you have some innocent people or some people who are not guilty of drugs 

222.46 230.28 A: uh might have to go through you know go through some unpleasant or demeaning things but at the same time uh 

226.15 226.99 B: [noise] 

230.54 232.16 A: it'll help them 

231.98 233.72 B: right 

232.64 233.45 A: you know 

233.89 237.60 B: so do you do you think and on that note do you think if you 

237.72 239.62 B: if you owned uh 

240.20 246.33 B: say a trucking company or something you think you'd probably have a a drug test policy 

245.62 251.10 A: absolutely no question about it no question about it 

248.91 252.25 B: right because something something as something as uh 

252.55 259.19 B: as uh as risky as driving around with in in a big big eighteen wheeler like that you'd want to make sure 

258.09 260.94 A: well let me let me let me put it to you this way 

261.10 262.15 A: (( uh )) 

262.76 265.49 A: i ah i do contract work 

265.10 266.28 B: oh okay 

265.73 267.82 A: okay and uh 

268.56 281.26 A: and i sometimes you have to hire people i have i have a number of people you know very few people that uh we employ but uh it it's very embarrassing to me er to go out on a job 

276.25 277.30 B: mhm 

281.25 289.84 A: and you got a guy out there half drunk or he or he's doped up and the customers are they're they're angry and they're complaining 

283.82 284.93 B: right 

290.02 291.67 B: (( that's right )) 

290.07 298.24 A: you know not not only are we talking drugs here we're talking alcohol you know that kinda thing there's a guy out there you know he's out there supposed to be working 

294.22 295.24 B: (( sure )) 

295.46 296.25 B: sure 

298.23 307.50 A: he takes a lunch break and he's out there drinking beer you know and then you go and and a lot of times these guys get hired here their clothes are falling off of them pants half falling down 

307.57 308.61 B: right 

307.66 308.52 A: you know 

308.79 310.88 A: it's uh it's ridiculous 

311.06 312.13 A: and so 

311.23 312.98 B: right 

312.35 314.68 A: it even in that sense 

314.74 315.79 A: (( um )) 

316.19 326.41 A: i but i don't have a drug test but i tell you uh whenever i hire anyone the very first thing i ask him is you know does he drink does he use drugs 

326.21 327.38 B: right 

326.79 328.67 A: then i'll and uh 

328.86 341.52 A: and and like when i first put a guy on i kinda monitor him i i might i might drop in or show up at a time where he's not expecting it and um i watching him close i'm looking at his eyes i'm i'm listening to him talk 

337.40 338.48 B: mhm 

341.46 343.87 A: i'm i'm seeing if his speech is slurred 

341.47 342.51 B: right 

343.56 345.79 B: watching body language sure sure 

344.74 355.08 A: right right and and so uh no we don't have a drug test but at the same time um you know what i do is just not big enough to warrant it you know 

354.64 356.29 B: right right 

355.10 360.55 A: but like what you're saying about a uh a big trucking company absolutely 

359.89 360.80 B: true 

360.52 372.11 A: absolutely and i can't even afford to deal with people that uh want to do that kinda thing even on a small scale like you know small scale business like what i do 

372.22 378.53 B: mhm right so it's just it's kinda of a qu- it's not just a question of safety but it's 

378.47 390.02 B: professionalism and making sure that you get the the quality of work out of the person that that you know that they're capable of if they're not they're not drunk or high or something 

389.34 390.85 A: absolutely 

390.52 392.36 B: (( right yeah )) 

391.47 404.46 A: absolutely so in in that sense i i um i'm all for it and [mn] and i i believe in random drug testing that's just like these guys that play baseball and football 

404.86 410.83 A: you understand what i'm saying you know you got guys out there uh you know multi million dollar contracts 

406.12 407.36 B: right right 

410.76 412.59 B: mhm 

411.64 420.34 A: you understand what i'm saying and and he cannot [laughter] he just can not control himself not to use drugs 

413.04 414.13 B: yeah 

420.54 427.38 A: and then he's angry then he's angry because they're they're drug testing and he got caught on drugs 

427.68 435.53 A: they suspend him from the n._f._l. and from the from from the professional baseball leagues for such things and and they know 

427.90 428.79 B: right 

435.61 442.15 B: and here he is play playing money for i mean making a ga- i mean making money playing a game you know 

442.94 444.45 B: you think they'd get 

443.00 446.51 A: right and and and i and i sit there and i marvel at it i say 

446.64 453.00 A: you know if if someone gives me a multi million dollar contract you understand what i'm saying 

452.92 454.01 B: right 

453.42 456.42 A: the least i can do is stay off a drugs 

455.91 457.62 B: [laughter] right right 

456.43 465.34 A: (( you know and then then it's like they catch these guys and then they turn right around and do it again [laughter] [laughter] it's ridiculous man )) 

461.04 463.67 B: yeah yeah 

465.18 467.33 B: that's audacity for you yes 

466.97 477.67 A: yeah it's it's ridiculous and and and you got you know i was looking at this one program the other night uh it had this kid he murdered a lady okay 

476.96 477.67 B: (( mm )) 

478.47 480.74 A: and but 

480.75 487.11 A: when he was born his his his mother first of all his mother his mother and his father were first cousins 

487.50 488.41 A: okay 

488.33 490.13 B: wow that's uh 

488.97 494.13 A: okay so that that he he's he's got some mental defects just in that area 

492.94 495.02 B: [laughter] right right 

494.39 500.20 A: okay then then they come to find out when they did a history on his mother and his father they were drug users 

501.11 501.88 B: (( mm )) 

502.51 516.51 A: you understand what i'm saying i i i tell you everything that i've ever uh studied or looked at or read about uh they need to stamp drugs out and and and i'm you know i've i've i've heard of people 

503.65 504.85 B: right 

516.46 527.15 A: talk about how that the the penalties for getting caught or getting charged with drugs are too stiff and not no they're not stiff enough that's the way i feel about it 

527.33 528.36 A: you know 

527.48 541.81 B: well then i mean one problem uh that you have is that our you know our prisons are are pretty overcrowded and a lot of that you know a whole whole lot of those are uh are drug offences and a lot of them aren't violent drug offences 

542.05 543.68 A: yeah well that's true too 

542.40 556.13 B: like it's just it's like drug possession in someone's own home you know or something like that so it's like and i mean i you know i i agree with you uh drugs are dangerous but it's like you know we gotta we kinda gotta 

556.14 564.45 B: a tax uh tax dollar problem here too i mean we've got we almost don't have room for the the guys who are committing the real violent crimes you know 

564.50 575.55 A: yeah yeah that that's true too i i agree with that uh but you know ev- every case i think you should be judged on its own merit if you got someone doing say 

573.91 574.93 B: right 

575.55 589.58 A: uh small scale pot in his home or something like that yeah you should handle that i think that should be handled differently the problem with the the problem with the the the jails is that you you got too many people in jail that really shouldn't be there 

589.37 590.44 B: right 

589.86 596.10 A: yo- you understand what i'm saying oh they just like you you look at these you look at these programs sometime uh 

591.20 592.19 B: right
