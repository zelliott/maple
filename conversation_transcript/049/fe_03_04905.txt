0.61 2.83 B: hello my name if vicki 

2.92 5.02 A: hi my name's dennis 

5.10 6.32 B: hi dennis 

6.61 9.19 B: [mn] well what do you think about drug testing 

8.90 12.77 A: oh it don't bother me i'm used to it i've been going through it for eighteen years 

12.45 13.89 B: (( no really )) 

13.34 18.98 A: yeah i'm a truck driver and we get surprise drug tests all the time i we- i had a 

20.00 21.14 A: (( oh )) 

21.66 23.85 A: eight of them one year 

23.86 24.89 B: wow 

24.55 26.37 A: they're just 

24.95 25.85 B: well 

26.51 28.08 A: go ahead oh 

26.73 27.76 B: go ahead 

28.10 32.18 A: i was going to say just with the truck drivers they can do random drug tests whenever they want to 

32.38 34.97 B: mhm i think that's a real good idea 

32.55 33.61 A: like 

34.94 36.75 A: yeah i think there ought to be 

35.78 36.72 B: because 

36.87 38.16 A: go ahead 

37.87 39.44 B: no go ahead [laughter] 

38.69 43.40 A: [laughter] i was gonna say i think there ought to be a mandatory drug trust to even get a driver's licence 

44.47 47.85 A: that way all these little high school kids and stuff couldn't get you know 

44.86 45.61 B: (( mm )) 

48.83 50.44 A: i don't know there's a 

50.55 56.10 A: i guess it just i know so many people that do drugs that i don't think should be out in public at all and 

56.99 63.16 A: they're just there gotta be some way to regulate the drug use and that would help it right there if they started doing 

63.36 67.97 A: mandatory drug tests on everybody that happens to have a driver's licence 

68.87 72.22 B: yeah well i think that's a little too invasive for me 

72.24 74.75 B: um i personally 

74.86 76.30 B: have no 

76.40 80.49 B: you know i have no inclination i have no dealing 

80.58 91.20 B: whatsoever with drugs i mean [laughter] that's the last thing i ever think about in a day you know when i wake up i i simply have no pull 

86.85 88.21 A: yeah 

91.49 96.94 B: in my life that have anything to do with drugs so i guess i'm blessed in that respect 

96.66 98.79 A: yeah 

97.51 105.80 B: because um you know in fact i don't know anyone who does drugs and most of the people that i know don't drink either so 

106.13 107.06 B: um 

107.30 110.16 B: i guess my world is different than yours 

110.88 121.36 A: well i don't associate with people that do drugs but i know i know of people that do drugs and i'm standing here putting beer in my refrigerator right now 

114.54 115.44 B: right 

117.36 118.24 B: right 

121.48 130.61 B: [laughter] okay well uh what i think about what i think about drugs and drug testing 

123.57 125.37 A: (( but )) 

130.68 134.89 B: is that you know people people who need drugs 

134.91 136.88 B: are looking for something 

137.06 146.45 B: and you know to me it's probably something missing in their lives or something that they're not happy about and so they're seeking something so 

146.61 152.94 B: i don't think that you know i don't like the u._s. government or the you know state government 

153.52 158.71 B: to you know be invasive and to try to um you know to try to 

158.86 162.77 B: tell people what's right and wrong just like i don't like george bush 

162.81 169.18 B: uh you know acting like he's a chief preacher and chief you know god expert 

169.60 179.10 B: um you know when i think he's supposed to be the president of the united states i cringe every time i hear the man talking on television because you know 

179.07 190.49 B: the he's not about god he's supposed to be doing things for the economy and so you know when i hear when i hear them talking about you know drug testing 

190.68 200.19 B: it's just like another big brother thing to me and i don't you know people should learn how to deal with their own problems and how to live their own lives 

194.55 195.23 A: [noise] 

200.86 204.81 B: and you know i guess we need to bring light into the world 

204.52 205.85 A: (( yeah )) 

205.34 210.72 B: perhaps other than you know drug testing just like with kids you know you can't make them 

210.75 212.88 B: behave they're gonna do 

213.03 218.49 B: well you know they're gonna do what you teach them they're gonna do what they learn in life so 

215.39 216.62 A: yeah 

218.55 221.96 B: you know when people do drugs it's a sign of something else 

221.62 223.02 A: [mn] 

222.26 226.69 B: so but i also i do think that you know i agree with you 

226.78 230.16 B: that it's a really good thing for truck drivers because 

230.27 234.94 B: you know it's a dangerous world out there on the highway look what happened this weekend 

234.89 236.85 A: yeah [noise] why what happened this weekend 

236.91 243.61 B: well i live in maryland and there was a huge there was a huge like fog uh 

243.99 251.18 B: on highway sixty eight in western maryland and there was like a sixty car pile up in the fog 

245.55 247.36 A: mhm 

251.00 252.13 A: wow 

251.31 258.02 B: and there were like the the high the interstate was closed until just you know a few minutes ago 

257.71 258.78 A: wow 

258.51 270.31 B: i mean it was a huge i saw pictures of it on t._v. and i couldn't believe it there was just like cars crashed all over the place and i think that you know i i don't think that had anything to do with drugs 

270.34 277.18 B: but imagine trying to manipulate a truck in that when you're on drugs i mean forget it 

273.94 275.68 A: yeah 

277.08 281.04 A: well i i don't think it's fair that truck drivers have to do 

277.63 278.31 B: (( so )) 

281.11 283.81 A: surprise drug tests but yet 

284.26 295.47 A: any individual that wants to can get in a car and drive from maryland all the way to california without any kind of regulation at all they can drive as long as they want as fast as they want 

295.51 298.38 A: but yet in a truck you can't drive over ten hours 

298.78 300.08 B: oh really 

299.50 305.94 A: yeah you know that's a federal law you can't drive more than ten hours without stopping and taking an eight hour break 

306.26 314.16 A: but yet anybody that wants to can get in their own personal car and drive as far as they want to without taking any kind of a break 

311.03 311.65 B: (( mm )) 

315.00 316.69 A: and it 

315.00 326.26 B: well but that may be protecting truck drivers because don't you have a lot of pressure from the people that hire you to get your take get your stuff there and to hurry it up and not to stop and 

325.80 337.42 A: [sigh] mm some companies yes the company i work for no they always tell us if you get tired stop and sleep you're more important than the load is if the load ain't there on time if they don't want it we'll take it somewhere else 

332.87 333.73 B: mhm 

337.67 344.92 B: right but it seems like for some people that some companies might be you know might be using that 

338.65 340.27 A: but 

345.33 348.69 B: to help their people you know it might be a protection 

346.73 348.27 A: well it 

348.51 358.85 A: yeah they're the government's really gotten down on that if they can prove that these companies are forcing these guys to drive further than they're supposed to when they're fine and 

357.19 357.86 B: (( mm )) 

358.95 359.75 A: (( but )) 

360.63 368.54 A: i don't know drug testing doesn't bother me but i think it oughta be for anybody on a vehicle that's in a on like federal highways 

368.69 369.76 B: mhm 

368.98 373.27 A: you know 'cause i can get pulled over at any time and have to pee in a cup and they can test me 

373.59 374.71 B: really 

374.13 379.91 A: yeah and i think it oughta be for anybody in a motor vehicle on a federally governed highway 

375.24 376.35 B: wow 

379.63 391.12 B: but why i mean why would people be driving a truck with that big huge responsibility and be doing drugs what do they do smoke dope in the truck or what 

391.13 395.43 A: i uh anything alcohol dope uh 

395.81 397.96 A: speed to stay awake 

398.05 401.33 A: some you know there's all kinds of stuff people do 

398.13 399.81 B: oh lord 

401.35 405.95 A: i've heard of people doing heroin in drug you know in the trucks before and 

405.30 406.35 B: [laughter] 

406.63 409.85 A: there is a lot of oh no you hear guys talking 

406.79 408.31 B: you're kidding 

408.76 412.28 B: you know i must be really naive because um 

412.33 419.71 B: you know when i'm out driving and i love to dri- i mean i love to drive i you know i've driven from like colorado 

419.66 429.81 B: to new york and from new york back to colorado and i mean i love to just get in the car and go you know and i always feel safe when i see all the truck driver 

426.10 427.91 A: mhm 

430.04 443.52 B: in the you know on the road i always have confidence that you know oh i don't need to worry about him he's gonna stay in his lane he's gonna you know i always feel totally confident that truck drivers are really with it maybe 

443.50 445.04 A: well for the most part 

444.11 446.59 B: maybe i should re-look that position 

446.32 459.17 A: no for the most part i'd say ninety nine point nine percent of them are you know just like there's the one percent of anything out there that's bad you know just like remember what bikers used to be like 

455.66 457.02 B: yeah 

459.22 460.20 B: yeah 

459.83 464.22 A: you know there was the outlaw bikers and stuff that's one percent 

464.43 465.87 B: yeah okay 

464.78 468.20 A: you know i bet if you pulled over a thousand trucks 

468.27 472.91 A: within a twenty four hour period you wouldn't find anybody on drugs 

470.35 471.20 B: uh-huh 

473.21 474.13 B: right 

474.26 479.80 A: but then on the next day you might pull over a thousand trucks and end up having ten guys on drugs 

480.31 488.10 A: and it's just you know and it's and it's more of a far east coast and a far west coast 

480.70 481.62 B: wow 

487.63 488.52 B: mhm 

488.21 489.30 A: you know it's 

489.39 494.28 A: it's a lot of the midwestern stuff you don't hear 'em even talking about it but you get out on the coasts 

494.34 496.06 A: and it seems like 

496.13 502.67 A: the further west you get or the further east you get the filthier the radio gets the c._b.s yes 

499.09 500.25 B: mhm 

501.75 502.55 B: wow 

502.82 503.74 A: (( but it's )) 

504.02 505.23 A: i don't know why 

504.65 515.90 B: it must be like a whole new world maybe they should do a reality show on truck drivers and drugs [laughter] not truck drivers and drugs but truck drivers you might be interesting 

511.03 512.59 A: oh they have before 

514.15 515.92 A: yeah 

516.43 517.58 A: well 

516.71 518.75 B: do people have computers 

519.31 520.55 B: in the trucks 

520.20 521.02 A: yeah 

521.38 522.58 B: you're kidding 

522.13 524.04 A: no they do they have 

523.03 525.94 B: and like like you get email and everything 

525.58 526.51 A: yes 

526.76 529.31 B: oh lord you're kidding 

529.03 530.58 A: no they have uh 

530.77 537.88 A: um matter of fact there's a couple companies that have satellite receivers on the trucks 

537.94 539.65 A: and they can 

539.73 549.40 A: type via computers back and forth to their dispatchers and the dispatchers will tell them this is the address you have to go to you have to go take a drug test within the next twenty four hours 

549.75 556.49 A: and they'll have to drive to the address and go take a drug test within that time frame and if they don't 

553.74 554.66 B: mhm 

556.55 564.96 A: they have shut offs on the truck these dispatchers can actually shut the trucks off from remote areas so the trucks won't run any more until the guy gets a drug test done 

563.23 564.43 B: wow 

565.94 571.92 B: gee and so they just do it randomly or they do it to guys that they might suspect 

571.90 573.45 A: say that again 

573.49 580.49 B: they just do it randomly or do they do it to guys who you know they suspect of maybe 

580.06 581.87 A: there's actu- 

580.89 582.59 B: you know that they're doing it 

582.21 592.47 A: there's actually a national department of uh transportation the federal government has that has a computer that'll that just throws names out 

588.67 589.64 B: right 

592.92 595.34 A: and it's a random thing 

595.36 599.89 A: and the year that i took eight in a row i had worked for this company for
