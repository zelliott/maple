46.80 47.83 B: uh 

49.25 52.41 A: so what was she said something about divorce 

51.98 56.98 B: yes does the the rise in divorce rates 

57.14 61.43 B: cause you to look at marriage and the sanctity of marriage 

62.15 63.95 B: um differently 

63.42 64.29 A: (( oh )) 

65.08 66.20 B: um 

66.45 68.52 B: i have to say it does 

68.72 71.06 B: um at least in it 

68.77 70.59 A: yeah 

71.46 74.70 B: i'm seeing that people that have been married for 

74.75 87.33 B: for ten and fifteen years are divorcing now where um probably a little bit further back that was if you if you made it five years you were going to be married forever 

87.11 93.74 A: yeah yeah i don't know what the reason is for all that stuff but it uh 

94.14 96.20 A: i don't understand it i 

95.81 97.11 B: (( you know yeah )) 

96.70 97.95 A: really don't [mn] 

97.47 98.97 B: i really uh 

99.08 107.23 B: i think people take marriage too lightly and because of that that is forcing the divorce rate up 

107.30 109.16 B: um people aren't 

109.64 113.66 B: having a long enough courtship aren't getting to know 

114.08 120.71 B: um their perspective mate before they're before they're jumping off into it uh 

116.48 118.26 A: yeah 

119.67 123.72 A: yeah a lot of rather spontaneous marriages 

123.34 125.20 B: right right 

125.29 126.23 B: um 

126.28 132.87 B: look i've been dating this girl for for three to six months i'm ready to get married let's get married and move off 

132.81 138.87 A: yeah yeah [laughter] yeah yeah well uh i think we were 

139.21 142.34 A: dating for about two and a half years 

141.75 144.40 B: well my wife and i dated for uh 

145.09 147.12 B: at least two years 

146.75 148.49 A: yeah 

147.21 152.12 B: i remember i wanted to date for for three to three and a half but we didn't make that 

152.01 155.51 A: (( [laughter] )) 

152.51 155.73 B: [laughter] 

155.99 157.34 B: but uh 

157.39 159.13 B: yeah i think that uh 

160.58 167.56 B: that because so many other people are doing it the divorce band wagon is just getting bigger and bigger 

167.39 171.46 A: [mn] yeah the increasing number makes it seem 

171.49 178.79 A: um increasingly acceptable and uh consequently that causes it to increase more 

173.90 175.36 B: right exactly 

178.04 179.08 B: mhm 

181.36 182.15 B: (( mm )) 

182.13 183.25 A: (( [mn] that's uh )) 

183.32 185.89 A: it's too bad but that's the way it is 

185.39 187.11 B: yeah 

187.47 190.82 B: uh do you think that society as a whole 

191.56 198.96 B: sees divorce as okay now unlike um say twenty thirty years ago 

200.50 202.98 A: (( well )) 

202.99 212.24 A: there is a different attitude towards that but i don't know exactly whether i guess you'd say it's acceptable uh 

211.48 216.35 B: it it's definitely more acce- acceptable today than whenever i was a little younger 

215.59 218.76 A: yeah yeah 

218.02 219.02 B: um 

220.12 223.39 B: neither of of my parents 

223.56 228.06 B: nor my grandparents um ever knew what a divorce was 

228.38 233.70 B: or uh ever had to go through it i come from a family where 

233.78 238.12 B: uh my dad is on his third 

234.32 237.23 A: (( yeah )) 

238.46 239.02 A: (( [mn] )) 

239.29 240.36 B: wife 

240.68 244.33 B: and my mother's on her second husband um 

243.68 250.30 A: (( yeah right )) 

244.65 257.41 B: my wife is is in the same boat and because of that i actually look at marriage as um something that really has to be worked on before you make that commitment um 

258.91 261.51 A: (( yeah i uh i )) 

261.80 264.63 A: don't know our our backgrounds haven't uh 

265.14 278.10 A: when i was growing up see i grew up during the depression and uh [mn] there just wasn't th- there wasn't any divorce i mean nobody around nobody i knew had ever got divorced 

268.37 269.31 B: yes sir 

277.09 279.01 B: right 

278.21 279.99 A: (( and )) 

280.13 281.62 A: but it uh 

280.51 281.07 B: (( [mn] )) 

282.16 283.90 A: it has changed 

284.32 286.07 A: definitely changed 

286.51 287.66 A: (( when i )) 

288.59 295.02 A: my mother and dad were married for their life and and uh 

296.08 300.62 A: my wife's families there's no divorces in that

328.70 339.82 B: [laughter] oh yeah um that seems to be uh my father's problem is uh even though he's married he he doesn't like to stop looking around 

329.48 332.73 A: (( [laughter] )) 

335.67 336.36 A: (( [mn] [mn] ))
