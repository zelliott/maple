524.57 525.82 A: don't do the right 

524.63 537.06 B: i know but um you know just like you said i'm i'm try i'm gonna try to get back on some kind of a routine but everything i seem to think of to exercise i don't i um 

537.15 540.36 B: i hurt myself [laughter] so 

538.42 542.45 A: uh-huh well the walking the walking is the best 

542.57 543.64 A: um 

543.53 545.04 B: yes it is [noise] 

543.68 556.50 A: i've had i've had several doctors tell me that walking is the best exercise form of exercise there is because it gets your heart rate up it gets your breathing up and it gets your system circulating right and uh 

556.50 561.49 A: uh and it's not hard on your joints walking as opposed to jogging 

561.58 565.98 A: and uh just a lot of pluses for it and uh 

565.21 566.25 B: yeah 

566.06 573.85 B: uh you know if e- even though you got arthritis you've got to keep walking i know some people that's got it and they say 

573.64 587.56 B: well it hurts but then there was one doctor told this person that's got arthritis in his knee he the doctor told him he said you've got to walk he said because it's gonna hurt but 

587.43 591.54 B: when you walk and you get it built up it won't hurt as much 

591.08 593.11 A: not as much that's right 

592.70 594.61 B: so um you know 

593.56 598.60 A: and the less and the less you walk then the more it is gonna hurt when you do walk so 

598.01 599.95 B: oh i i know it howard i know
