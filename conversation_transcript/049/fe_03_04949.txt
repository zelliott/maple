0.49 3.42 B: hello my name is roselle [cough] 

5.83 6.86 B: hello 

6.55 7.78 A: hello 

8.07 9.63 B: (( hello [laughter] )) 

9.02 10.80 A: (( hi this is anthony )) 

10.30 12.93 B: hi this is roselle how are you today 

12.46 14.99 A: good good good 

14.22 15.17 B: um 

15.69 17.35 A: so do you know the topic 

17.50 28.21 B: yeah is it uh should public schools forbid children to read certain books they call that the question of censor- censorship what do you think 

26.58 27.63 A: yes 

28.25 32.56 A: uh i i definitely think they shouldn't uh 

32.66 33.70 A: ban 

33.93 37.26 A: books uh for uh public schools how 'bout you 

37.06 42.15 B: so you think any book that exists a school child child ought to have access to it 

42.56 46.66 A: um that's a good question i guess uh 

47.90 55.60 A: there's there is a there is a question of what [mn] you know what a book is you know i could kind a type something up and then call it a book right 

48.14 48.83 B: (( [mn] )) 

54.93 67.78 B: well that's true too that's true too um i think i think freedom is good and variety is good but um i think there there are themes that are not appropriate for school children at all and i think 

66.91 67.94 A: like what 

68.13 76.25 B: um sexual themes wh- i mean would you want your school child exposed to that and allowed that they have that at school would you allow it at home 

76.36 81.85 A: well it depends uh what exactly you're talking about you know i mean if you're talking about like a uh 

82.44 86.90 A: uh hustler uh magazine or something like that of course not but 

86.32 88.35 B: right right exactly 

87.13 91.73 A: it depends that why i said it depends on what like they they're defining as a book you know 

91.04 100.83 B: right that's true that's true but i mean there are actual books that have the same contact content say i never i never read madonna's book she put out 

100.46 101.54 A: sex 

101.27 105.35 B: y- yeah i think that was the name of it but you know that's an actual book 

105.10 106.70 A: yeah that's the thing 

105.38 109.53 B: and there's no way you'd want to give that to a child um to me i mean 

109.51 119.00 B: they call it an issue of censorship i don't think it's an issue of censorship i think it's an issue of what's appropriate for a child i mean what are you teaching that child it's not that 

118.86 128.20 B: it's not that we have to give them narrow little minds but i mean i wouldn't i wouldn't do that to my child to give them something that that they're not ready to handle like that 

127.51 132.13 A: hey that's a good point that's a good point how 'bout if they just said novels 

132.55 141.80 B: uh that's a good question too 'cause there's there's there are novels around that are they may as well be pornography as descriptive as they are and you know 

141.53 142.46 A: like what 

142.53 150.16 B: well like like say the harlequin romance novels you'll see in the aisle at walmart or whatever like that see i don't think that should be 

143.39 143.96 A: (( [cough] )) 

146.45 148.49 A: oh yeah yeah 

149.94 164.43 B: i don't think it's censorship to say don't give that to schoolchildren i think it's just i just think it's just commonsense you know obviously it's available on the common market it's not being censored but [mn] neither would i give it to a child you know it's [mn] 

160.40 161.71 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

162.72 169.38 A: that's a ve- that's a good point yeah i don't know what parents would maybe uh say that they don't care about uh 

169.67 179.55 A: uh allowing their their uh kid to read something like that but i guess there are some uh libertarian parents parents [laughter] that wouldn't really care i don't know 

172.99 174.35 B: yeah 

175.80 177.95 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

178.81 189.28 B: yeah you know that's true that's where [cough] oh really you know that that makes i have one daughter she's one year old yes it does it changes how you think sometimes too 

179.65 181.35 A: i don't have kids so 

181.90 183.25 A: you have kids 

184.00 186.01 A: oh so that makes a lot of difference 

188.46 191.44 A: (( yeah that's [mn] i i couldn't see that )) 

190.82 196.22 B: but see where where kids are accessing the internet too i really [mn] i think that 

193.66 197.05 A: oh my god that don't even get me on that 

196.48 204.58 B: yeah i think that i think that should be i think it's good but i think it should be monitored carefully because it could be the same kind of 

204.59 210.12 B: thing that would not be good for them if it you know 'cause there's a lot on the internet that is bad 

208.94 219.09 A: oh yeah i mean 'cause i i don't have that at home i have to go to the library and sometimes i sign up to use it at the library and i see like twelve year old kids and and they're looking at porn- uh pornography 

218.30 221.25 B: you're kidding wow that's disgusting 

219.16 224.82 A: yeah and you and you tell the librarians and and like you know the they don't do much 

223.44 227.24 B: you know there was actually a law that um 

227.49 234.05 B: i don't remember if it was one of the states or if it was federal i think it was one of the states wanted to pass a law 

234.07 240.00 B: saying we will have filters at libraries so that kids can't access that stuff [mn] 

237.64 238.59 A: yeah 

238.88 243.49 A: and the librarians were against it yeah i remember that yeah 

240.35 241.19 B: (( yes )) 

241.32 244.66 B: and they shot it down [mn] i thought it was crazy but 

243.74 246.11 A: that that that i didn't understand 

245.44 248.48 B: no it's like that's not censorship that's 

249.10 251.43 A: th- that's like you said appropriateness 

249.56 250.47 B: that's 

250.79 253.39 B: yeah exactly and 

252.27 264.24 A: i don't see why what kind of research used they they need seeing like uh like uh you know whatever topic it is on pornography like uh pictures and stuff like that you know 

263.90 265.25 B: yeah 

264.62 272.14 A: but you know the other thing about uh like banning certain things is that it entices the the kids even more to see it you know what i mean 

268.06 269.02 B: yeah 

271.37 274.15 B: well that's true uh it does i mean 

273.87 275.62 A: like that guy eminem 

275.69 277.00 B: yeah 

276.39 279.06 A: he's another one that's like a current uh 

279.19 281.14 A: censorship topic you know 

280.85 287.37 B: yeah i don't know what the attraction is with him except that he's supposedly bad i mean 

287.02 288.29 A: (( like a rebel )) 

287.33 296.98 B: i [mn] yeah he's a rebel i mean that's i you look at him he doesn't look nice he doesn't sound nice i mean what is the attraction but except he's a rebel 

296.68 300.41 A: well yeah like you know i guess kids are drawn to that rebel figure 

300.03 302.47 B: yeah i guess [mn] 

301.47 307.60 A: and the more you try to ban him the more [mn] you know they they'll they'll try to sneak tapes from their friends or whatever 

307.02 310.60 B: yeah well that's a point too i mean there has to be 

311.37 319.23 B: well if you're talking about your own children or whatever there has to be a relationship there to where you're not just saying don't do this and don't do that but where 

319.25 321.91 B: where there's understanding going on you know 

321.92 331.14 B: don't do this but this is why and because it's not good for you and as you get older you'll understand better and you'll you'll be responsible for making those decisions yeah 

330.92 334.33 A: yeah i guess uh some parents uh 

334.42 343.02 A: i i don't know i don't have kids but they say a lot of parents don't have the time you know to monitor their [mn] kids uh internet use and and such 

340.12 341.34 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

343.06 357.89 B: or they'll yeah that's true and they'll the ones that do try to monitor it's like they'll just tell the kids what to do but they don't have time to explain you know this is why it's important and without that that's why kids rebel because they're like that's restricting me 

355.22 358.21 A: that's a good yeah there's no rational yeah 

357.72 361.80 B: yeah [mn] stop restricting me you're just doing this to me i don't understand it 

360.94 363.29 A: just for the sake of punishing yeah 

362.68 364.58 B: yeah yeah no kidding 

363.43 365.08 A: that's a good point too 

365.29 367.21 A: yeah that's a very good point 

365.61 368.97 B: there has to be there has to be understanding both ways 

368.71 373.36 A: that you're actually looking out f- you know for their uh wellbeing 

371.68 372.64 B: (( right )) 

372.79 375.74 B: right and where they have something to say 

375.89 380.19 B: i i think that is so important with with children as if 

380.16 392.17 B: if you want them to hear you then when they have something to say you better listen to them 'cause that's something i when i was growing up i mean i grew up i had wonderful parents but they didn't listen i mean 

384.48 385.69 A: oh yeah 

392.20 397.45 B: when i said something it wasn't always important so i got to the point i didn't want to listen to them either you know 

396.60 400.13 A: ah yeah that's true that's a good point 

398.24 401.95 B: you know it goes both ways you got to listen if you want to be heard yeah 

401.20 407.12 A: yeah right you got to validate them yeah the thing is when i heard the topic uh i remember like when they 

407.26 414.60 A: i don't know when i was like younger when they were talking about banning certain like classic books like uh huckleberry finn and things like that 

413.52 425.74 B: oh my goodness i think yeah i think that is really stupid and see that's where i think it's actually what i would call censorship i think that i think that there should be free access to those 

414.86 415.82 A: you know 

425.09 432.37 A: yeah and then some ye- yeah that's the thing that's why like it depends what they define as you know a book because some people uh 

430.13 431.51 B: right 

432.79 442.65 A: like you said those those [laughter] those supermarket uh n- books yeah i guess some people would consider them books but [laughter] i don't know 

436.31 438.43 B: harlequin novels yeah 

440.61 441.26 B: (( well )) 

441.71 454.38 B: [laughter] technically they are [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] oh that's true and you know it's so much 

443.66 448.86 A: uh yeah i mean i guess anything you can read beyond ten pages i guess is a book i don't know 

449.02 450.80 A: and so they have to define 

454.33 465.48 B: how you use words to present something because they can say censorship about not allowing huckleberry finn to be read or they can say censorship about not allowing pornography 

465.31 471.93 B: and to me i mean yeah to me that's misrepresenting it but i think it's i think i think it's just a way 

465.39 467.14 A: it yeah [mn] that's the thing 

467.60 468.80 A: (( you )) 

472.22 475.29 B: when they have an agenda they say it that way you know 

474.81 477.95 A: got to be specific about what they mean exactly 

476.80 479.06 B: yeah yeah no kidding 

478.06 480.27 A: it's too broad too broad a topic 

480.15 484.15 B: i'm curious what they're using these conversations for do you know 

484.41 485.86 A: um 

485.06 488.12 B: it's just like an opinion survey only broader 

488.21 496.42 A: well it it's it's more like i think um not about our opinions but about uh like how we use how words it's like a linguistic study 

496.23 497.21 B: really 

496.75 497.95 A: yeah 

497.37 501.52 B: so it's not about what we actually think but how we express it 

498.92 500.84 A: no no they don't care 

500.89 506.90 A: yeah exactly they don't care about what we think [laughter] they just want to hear what words we use 

502.24 509.70 B: [laughter] [laughter] i think that's funny [laughter] 

507.65 511.14 A: yeah they just want to hear us ramble 

509.71 510.88 B: (( [mn] )) 

511.24 515.34 B: okay well i guess we can ramble then [laughter] 

513.70 517.24 A: yeah i don't know how many more minutes we have do you [mn] 

516.43 521.46 B: yeah i don't know how much longer i can talk about censorship either but [laughter] 

520.37 523.84 A: well i guess you know y- you say you have a one year old 

523.88 525.62 B: (( yeah she'll )) 

524.59 530.16 A: so when when she she gets a little older then you'll definitely be uh having more to say about this 

530.18 539.99 B: yeah probably i will i'll have to i'll have to face it in more specific things rather than just as a general you know i have an opinion about it now but 

539.55 540.49 A: yeah 

540.25 543.53 B: that's yeah you're right it'll be [mn] a lot more practical 

543.56 549.02 A: yeah 'cause you also got to think back like when you were young too and what like your parents were saying they should ban 

546.53 547.66 B: yeah 

547.86 548.93 B: yeah 

548.98 550.33 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

550.78 556.78 B: if you could see when i was little i remember when i was six years old and i was so excited about going to school 

550.94 551.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

556.47 557.55 A: yeah 

556.94 558.40 B: and 

559.06 569.20 B: [lipsmack] i think oh i think my parents didn't realise that but i just assumed because i because you know i was six and all the children went to first grade when they were six years old i assumed that i would 

569.07 583.39 B: and i didn't know it but they had decided in the meantime to home school me which wasn't a bad thing i mean they did and i i had a great education but i remember i remember just thinking [mn] 

574.12 575.02 A: (( oh )) 

583.53 589.89 B: i i remember being so disappointed when i found out i'm not going to school in the fall you know and i was only six years old 

588.29 591.55 A: oh they just sprung it on you last minute 

591.45 599.89 B: well they didn't know i was uh they didn't know i understood as much as i did or that i was planning on it and looking forward to it they didn't realise that 

595.90 597.29 A: uh
