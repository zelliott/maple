94.63 103.87 A: almost a month because ah yeah i can't really um i can't really do anything i have a really bad injury that i haven't got it diagnosed yet but it's pretty painful 

95.87 97.03 B: oh 

103.53 104.37 B: really 

104.18 108.38 A: so yeah so i've been i've been kind of out of commission it's pretty bad

117.64 118.82 B: what did you do 

119.70 127.43 A: i'm not exactly sure i was having um i think i might've um well first i thought i might've pulled some muscles while i was lifting 

121.08 121.90 B: oh 

126.87 127.85 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

127.53 139.93 A: ah because i was feeling a little bit of pain but it wasn't too bad i mean it was painful it would get worse and then it would get better and i just kind of just chalked it off as just normal everyday pains and i would take some hot baths and whatever 

140.01 141.34 A: and then um 

141.62 148.23 A: [lipsmack] it but i wasn't going to the gym because i didn't wanna um throw it out again and then a couple of weeks ago i was riding my bike 

145.82 146.65 B: right 

148.24 152.81 A: and um i was going up on a curb and i hit the curb and um 

152.93 163.77 A: and i kind of jarred my back and ever since then i've been out of commission it's i i don't i don't even know what it is i'm i'm probably gonna go to the doctor one day this week like ah in the emergency room because um 

154.84 155.62 B: yeah 

163.80 168.53 A: i don't really have a doctor so um yeah so i just have to um 

165.59 166.67 B: oh 

168.64 180.43 A: i'm just gonna try to go to the emergency room and see if i can get a diagnosis 'cause it's pretty painful um i been taking yeah i've been taking some painkillers just to get by because without that i wasn't i couldn't even function you know 

173.99 175.37 B: it sounds terrible 

180.12 181.80 B: you should maybe go today 

182.04 189.55 A: yeah well today it's actually not as bad as it's been which i i took a few pain killers yesterday and that kind of made it feel better but 

189.16 191.30 B: maybe you just pinched a nerve or something 

191.36 198.07 A: might you know from people i talk to i think i either um pinched a nerve or um 

198.26 199.64 A: (( [lipsmack] um [lipsmack] )) 

200.60 211.26 A: have a herniated disc or slipped a disc or something like that or have sciatica one of those three things like that's just all that i could think it might be just from just talking to people 

202.44 204.23 B: oh yeah yeah 

210.80 211.82 B: yeah 

211.18 225.28 A: but um it it's pretty bad because i really like to work out and i really like to be in physical shape and ah i'm not now because i can i can't i can't do anything you know so it's kind of really disappointing to me you know 

222.38 223.28 B: yeah 

225.36 226.50 B: yeah 

225.88 229.95 A: so 'cause i mean i think it's pretty important to stay in shape you know and um
