0.00 1.56 B: see how i do hello [noise] 

1.23 3.27 A: oh hey my name's alex 

2.97 5.17 B: hey alex this is chris how you doing 

4.22 6.07 A: [noise] hey chris [noise] 

5.29 11.71 B: [sigh] ah all right so we're talking about a c- topic i don't know much about [laughter] [sigh] 

12.12 13.46 A: really 

12.80 15.60 B: ah divorce yeah 

15.48 18.17 A: well i think that um 

18.45 20.60 A: the increase in the divorce 

20.68 30.11 A: i i think society's kind of changed in a way that people aren't really expected to um remain 

23.39 24.27 B: mhm 

30.34 33.35 A: chaste before before marriage 

31.48 32.40 B: oh 

33.17 34.10 B: right 

34.25 37.85 A: so there you know i think prior there was a 

38.68 47.47 A: [sigh] kind of [sigh] [mn] you need to get some so you you got married so that you were allowed to [noise] let your juices flow 

43.36 44.41 B: right 

47.28 51.28 B: right right well ah i suppose i mean 

51.42 52.81 B: are you married 

52.00 54.19 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] no i'm not married [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

53.17 56.63 B: oh okay i ah ah the thing about it is um 

56.95 60.78 B: you see if you get divorced these days you basically have to ah 

61.09 64.78 B: um pay your wife half of everything you make 

65.02 67.78 A: (( right unless you have a pre-nup )) 

65.17 66.62 B: (( a- and and ah )) 

67.47 71.96 B: right and even if you do have a pre-nup ah they could still be contested 

71.43 73.15 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

72.10 77.55 B: and ah i dunno i think that's kinda a a little off balance right now 

77.60 80.59 B: especially since ah women can work 

79.98 87.39 A: [noise] although there have been ca- there are i mean i think they get more media attention 'cause they're so rare [noise] but ah there have been cases of men 

87.54 90.08 A: getting [noise] alimony payments 

89.33 98.63 B: [noise] [sigh] yeah that happened with ah jennifer lopez and ah her husband yeah yeah he got like twenty million dollars or something like that some crazy amount of money 

92.56 94.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] and chris judd )) 

98.23 99.40 A: uh-huh 

98.76 112.94 B: so it worked out in his favor but i think nine times out of ten the husband has to you know give the wife tons of money [sigh] even if he doesn't make a lot of money he has to basically give half of what he makes [sigh] and ah i i dunno i think that's kinda rough 

103.21 104.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

110.03 111.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] [sigh] [noise] )) 

113.07 118.33 A: yeah yeah that that is rough [noise] that is rough but i think [noise] you know [noise] 

115.17 116.18 B: yeah 

118.78 125.20 A: [sigh] i think all the things that drove people to get married [noise] in the past [noise] are no longer 

121.94 122.84 B: (( uh-huh )) 

125.24 127.80 A: [noise] really in effect [noise] 

127.51 131.63 B: uh-huh so why do you think people get married ah these days 

132.94 134.43 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

134.65 136.18 A: i think tradition 

136.04 137.11 B: yeah 

136.62 141.16 A: [lipsmack] and i there's is still cer- a certain element of you know 

142.01 145.72 A: women have this dream of getting married and men just kind of [sigh] 

145.73 146.95 B: go along with it [laughter] 

146.29 151.39 A: ex- yeah they expect that [sigh] they'll get married at some point 

150.79 155.46 B: right right right well i guess i mean if you're gonna have kids it's probably a good idea to get married 

155.01 156.62 A: yeah definitely [lipsmack] 

156.06 162.72 B: but ah i i mean if wh- when people get married and don't have kids i don't really get the point of that you know like why bother you know 

162.88 166.97 B: why not just um you know live together or whatever you know [sigh] 

167.44 169.74 B: but ah yeah you know i guess [noise] [noise] 

167.47 168.31 A: right 

168.95 171.41 A: well i mean at the same time there's kind of a 

173.22 175.98 A: the whole experience of getting married i mean 

176.05 182.28 A: not necessarily getting married like in a vegas chapel but getting married like in the traditional sense of 

181.61 182.48 B: uh-huh 

182.32 185.05 A: getting engaged and then having the 

185.13 191.90 A: you know long engagement where you get ready for the humongous wedding and making all those decisions and you know 

187.97 189.07 B: yeah 

192.09 194.77 A: kind of making two lives as one 

194.81 197.28 A: it kind of is a marking 

197.67 204.84 A: marking spot or a change in the relationship and it and it puts like a new beginning to it [sigh] so i 

199.89 200.99 B: yeah 

201.25 202.36 B: yeah 

203.75 205.19 B: yeah i suppose so 

204.91 207.04 A: i mean i think it still has an effect 

207.00 208.41 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

207.91 213.37 A: um you know if two people are together and they just live together and just kinda [mn] 

213.79 215.30 A: work at it you know 

215.35 217.16 A: just do what they're doing 

217.20 221.95 A: um i think it's been mathematically proven that you 

223.09 229.01 A: lose like you lose that lust effect after like the pheromones 

223.10 224.32 B: live longer 

228.60 229.53 B: (( uh-huh )) 

229.09 231.96 A: that attract you to another person 

231.48 232.45 B: right 

232.06 234.96 A: lose their effect after a certain number of years 

234.51 235.66 B: really 

235.08 238.39 A: and they've actually correlated that with like the the divorce rate 

237.87 239.71 B: (( [noise] oh really that's )) 

238.81 241.01 A: [noise] yeah and i think 

240.42 241.34 B: (( interesting )) 

241.36 243.68 A: you know if you just [noise] 

244.59 252.69 A: [lipsmack] live together you know the lo- if you get in a fight or you know some type of real big disagreement 

252.09 252.93 B: uh-huh 

252.84 255.38 A: [noise] there's nothing really holding you together 

255.13 256.56 B: right right 

255.90 260.20 A: whereas a marriage like you have to get if you really want i mean you really have to [lipsmack] 

260.47 262.02 A: work through things 

262.14 263.55 B: (( sure [sigh] [sigh] )) 

262.20 270.79 A: because you know you're married and if you re- if you if you wanna end the marriage then you have to go through a process to do that so [noise] 

270.04 279.43 B: so so so which do you think is more um valuable to to you know stay with somebody even though you're having problems with them and work through it or just to you know [sigh] 

279.44 282.88 B: kinda pick up and go when the when you know 

283.66 286.62 A: i think working through it is important 

285.82 287.59 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

286.99 289.07 A: i mean i don't necessarily 

289.85 291.97 A: think that you know 

292.56 294.98 A: herc- condone the old style of 

295.95 301.47 A: there's absolutely no reason to get divorced and you just stick with it no matter what like i think 

301.49 307.56 A: there are reasons to get divorced and there are people that have worked on it and then and do in fact have 

307.24 307.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

307.83 310.33 A: [noise] ah irreconcilable differences 

309.74 323.48 B: mhm mhm yeah i i i dunno i think it's a tough um [sigh] it's a tough issue 'cause i mean on one hand i i people should just be free to do what they want if you're not happy with somebody [sigh] you know you should be able to you know 

323.65 331.25 B: not have to stay with them or n- you know it shouldn't be too difficult for you to have to leave and it's sort of like [sigh] i mean people could be a lot happier if they just 

328.47 329.11 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

331.84 337.02 B: [sigh] can have the freedom to to be to be with who they want to be with you know 

337.07 338.17 B: but um 

338.26 345.31 B: [mn] i mean [sigh] i dunno i guess it's kinda tough i guess it's it's it's it's sorta different for older generations you know marriage is a lot more of a 

345.46 348.32 B: of a you know the way things were [mn] 

348.51 357.88 B: and but now the divorce rate is so high that um i think a lot of people just don't really see the sense of getting married 'cause half the people that get married get divorced anyway you know [sigh] 

356.67 360.96 A: [noise] right i actually talked to my mother about this i said you know 

361.08 362.83 A: i think people are waiting 

363.15 365.23 A: people my age are waiting longer 

365.11 366.42 B: yeah 

365.88 367.31 A: to get married 

367.37 369.62 B: yeah ho- how old are you 

368.19 369.13 A: uh 

369.33 370.65 A: i'm twenty three 

370.41 374.83 B: oh okay yeah yeah um are your parents ah 

374.61 377.13 A: my parents are married been married like thirty years yeah 

376.99 377.55 B: (( [noise] )) 

377.76 384.65 B: oh really that's ye- my my p- see my parents got divorced when i was w- w- like [mn] almost two [sigh] 

384.50 398.06 B: so ah yeah and then my mom got remarried and now she's been married for twenty four years after that [sigh] so sh- so but see what i think is kinda strange is my parents were married for nine years before they got divorced 

384.72 386.31 A: oh wow [noise] [noise] [noise] 

397.99 401.79 B: and i would think like after being with someone for nine years married 

401.63 414.39 B: i mean you should've been more able to work out your problems yo- you know in that i i would understand like getting married and like maybe two or three years later realizing it was no good and leaving [sigh] but i'd figure if you stuck it stuck it out for nine years [sigh] 

414.23 418.11 B: i mean to me that seems like such a long time you know that why would you 

417.23 427.39 A: well i i i kinda think differently i think that if you've been together for a short amount of time you should kinda be expected to be able to work things out but if you've been together a long time it's 

427.59 432.42 A: [noise] more likely that over that period you know someone has changed [lipsmack] 

431.79 433.53 B: [noise] [noise] right right right 

433.14 441.93 A: you know these people that get divorced after twenty five years there's some people that are like wow you know twenty five years and then you got divorced like figuring you'd been through everything by then but 

440.07 443.18 B: (( yeah )) 

442.53 446.36 A: you know someone that you meet at twenty five could be very different at fifty 

446.24 449.93 B: yeah exactly exactly completely different i mean 

449.70 452.40 A: and you could have had twenty five great years together 

450.23 450.79 B: (( [mn] )) 

452.00 455.13 B: right right then you're just different people 

453.06 455.49 A: and it's just you're then you know 

455.64 460.06 A: in nineteen sixty all are doing great and in nineteen eighty five 

461.04 462.62 A: [noise] not you know 

462.12 463.51 B: yeah sure 

462.68 464.84 A: you're just have different interests 

463.49 475.77 B: times change things change yeah definitely i mean i could see that [sigh] easily i guess that's what makes marriage so tough 'cause then once you're with someone for that long it's like you kinda [sigh] feel like you've invested so much in it you don't want to get divorced or whatever or 

475.61 479.40 B: i dunno that's why the way they do it in europe is they just have mistresses you know 

479.07 480.60 A: [laughter] 

479.31 488.93 B: and it seems to work out for them i mean they they it's famous you know like the the president of france um the the last president i think i he when he when he um 

488.78 503.78 B: when he died his wife and his mistress were at his funeral standing right next to each other and it was it's just kind of accepted that that's the way it is you know [sigh] and um i dunno like kinda keeps everyone happy because then you could [sigh] have the family relationship which is sort of just the 

503.77 514.41 B: the you know um official yeah the official one and then you could have your you know whatever you have on the side to to um you know enjoy your life you know 

505.82 507.98 A: logistical yeah 

513.30 517.36 A: [noise] well the topic is family values and i i i don't 

518.56 523.24 A: [sigh] [noise] i have i've [noise] there are people that [noise] have that can work that out but 

523.74 526.68 A: i don't think you know a a trio 

526.23 527.08 B: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

527.33 529.07 A: i think there's always someone 

529.08 535.48 A: that's like has more power in the relationship and in that case it would be whoever the president was you know like 

534.25 535.22 B: right right 

535.92 537.18 B: right right [sigh] 

536.30 540.14 A: he's the middle man between everything else and i think truly 

540.17 542.68 A: successful relationships are all about 

542.83 544.15 A: you know equal 

544.69 546.06 A: equal power 

544.69 545.75 B: (( uh-huh )) 

546.12 550.01 B: do you think that that that how often do you think that happens though 

549.92 551.60 A: not as often as it should [noise] 

551.35 560.68 B: yeah i mean i think that's pretty hard to to even find that kind of a relationship [sigh] but what about polygamists i mean they have families you know and they have like [noise] 

559.56 563.16 A: yeah most of the time there's like one guy and all these women 

563.52 565.17 B: right right right [sigh] 

565.24 567.33 B: yeah that's true that's true 

568.17 571.25 B: [sigh] well it could go the other way round too i suppose 

571.31 576.06 B: if ah i i think in some si- um societies like ah 

576.08 580.49 B: didn't the amazon women used to ha- have like three or four 

579.05 581.39 A: [noise] amazon women had sex with each other 

581.24 582.46 B: what's that 

581.74 584.31 A: the a- amazon women had sex with each other and just 

583.76 584.81 B: they did 

584.46 585.46 A: yeah 

585.26 587.96 B: oh and what they do use men for slaves 

587.45 588.58 A: basically 

588.28 593.37 B: oh well you know that's that's a that's a pretty interesting 

591.92 593.60 A: and you're like that's an option 

593.47 599.95 B: that's a pretty interesting [laughter] ah way to do it i don't know i suppose that i you know i i don't 

594.19 596.11 A: [laughter]
