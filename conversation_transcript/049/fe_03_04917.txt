408.50 409.31 A: so 

409.99 414.50 B: well thank you for educating me because [laughter] i didn't know that [noise] 

410.36 411.66 A: it's based on 

412.91 413.72 A: (( based )) 

413.85 416.98 A: based on japanese ah folklore 

415.96 416.98 B: yeah 

417.39 418.36 A: stuff 

418.56 425.97 A: i remember it being [noise] yeah it's on ah the pocket monsters ah good luck charm type things which 

418.77 420.22 B: oh on folklore [noise] 

426.16 427.17 A: where 

427.55 431.26 A: they believe that like small monsters who keep away like 

431.54 433.78 A: ah bad spirits and things 

433.64 435.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] oh )) 

434.47 436.38 A: and that's what it's based upon 

436.66 442.25 A: like i mean very loosely based upon it but they that's where the idea for it came from 

441.58 443.89 B: [noise] [noise] wow i didn't know that either [noise] 

443.37 448.91 A: so yeah that was a big stink in like the christian community that pokemon was evil 

448.90 449.93 B: yeah 

448.95 452.83 A: 'cause that it's based on a ancient japanese religion 

453.06 455.73 A: very loosely just the idea of like 

455.12 459.92 B: well you're not supposed to believe in other spirits you know you're not supposed to believe in other 

456.08 457.60 A: pocket monsters 

460.23 462.25 B: spirits or gods or 

460.36 461.29 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

462.55 471.06 A: but i mean i am a christian but i don't believe that you know by playing pokemon i'm somehow selling my soul and believing 

469.90 472.95 B: [sigh] right exactly you know 

471.65 476.31 A: in false deities and i mean i don't think children think that either 

473.54 475.05 B: exactly 

476.11 478.59 B: i don't think so either and you know 

478.67 487.00 B: my six year old brings his bible to school because he [laughter] wants to teach everyone about god so [sigh] i don't think that there's any danger of him 

484.00 484.96 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

487.25 490.82 B: you know worshipping pokemon so [laughter] 

487.48 488.33 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

490.78 496.38 A: i mean i just it it was one of those extreme religious right southern baptist convention 

494.42 495.48 B: yeah 

496.41 498.20 B: i didn't hear about that 

496.44 497.53 A: actually that 

498.01 503.16 A: the s._b._c. the southern baptist convention actually wasn't the one that threw a fit over it it was ah 

504.06 505.42 A: oh 

507.79 510.42 A: ah i can't remember it was one of the ultra conservative 

510.83 513.64 A: ah lutheran sects i think 

514.29 515.28 A: (( or something )) 

515.20 515.97 B: huh 

515.90 517.93 A: that threw a fit over it 

517.97 522.21 A: i just saw it in a couple of christian magazines and thought it was quite odd 

520.62 521.74 B: yeah 

522.40 526.16 B: [sigh] well that goes back to you know [laughter] being an american 

526.20 527.08 A: yeah 

526.40 532.43 B: you know everybody has an opinion and [noise] you know we all seem to get along and you know 

532.34 536.80 A: [noise] [noise] well we at least don't kill each other very often so 

536.27 538.57 B: not very often no [laughter] 

539.52 540.28 B: so 

539.66 542.18 A: [noise] and then when we do usually the rest of the world 

542.25 546.11 A: the rest of the united states sides against the people that are doing the killing so 

546.83 548.85 A: unless it's justified 

549.83 551.49 A: like yeah 

550.19 561.47 B: so let me ask you now the the other five the when you had your other five calls or whatever is it easy to stay on the topic or do you usually find yourself [sigh] straying from the subject or 

559.54 560.35 A: well 

561.43 566.43 A: i would count the majority like the first half of this conversation as being on topic 

566.37 567.32 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

566.53 568.95 A: personally what they want they want 

569.22 571.56 A: to see like develop conversations 

571.57 582.28 A: and they're afraid i believe 'cause i didn't stay on topic on any of them i didn't know about the eight minutes thing until last night when i read it like i hadn't read the email and they called me back nine times and they s- they 

577.46 578.63 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

582.50 589.06 A: will only call you like three times unless they like the way that you speak and they think that you can hold people in the conversation 

588.49 589.92 B: yeah 

589.35 592.39 A: so i think what they're trying to do is avoid dead air time 

593.11 599.90 A: but we haven't had any dead air time ah i mean we we haven't been on topic but we've been talking and they wanna a good sample 

593.17 594.76 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

598.49 599.90 B: yeah cause that's kinda what
