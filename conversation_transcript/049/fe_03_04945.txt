7.33 8.92 A: i'm fine thank you 

8.58 9.60 B: good 

9.81 14.69 A: so topic is do you think they are required to read a book 

14.40 19.86 B: oh well do do you think the public or private schools have the right to forbid students to read certain books 

19.37 20.86 A: right 

21.40 25.03 A: um certain books yes um 

26.06 28.69 A: you know one that are um 

29.73 32.54 A: well like sexual and stuff like that 

31.92 33.10 B: mhm 

33.39 34.74 A: i think so 

34.52 36.24 B: i think so as well 

37.05 38.49 B: um [mn] 

38.52 44.78 B: you know i've had kids come up through the system and i've run across the problem myself 

44.90 53.88 B: and um the thing that always amazes me about it is when they cry when they cry censorship is that you're not saying the child can't read the book forever you're just saying 

54.13 59.13 B: that at that [mn] certain age it should be their mind should be protected 

58.30 63.06 A: [mn] right right and you know that's the same and you know 

60.10 61.14 B: so 

63.41 65.29 A: or else they could you know 

65.34 69.61 A: if it is age appropriate and it's offensive 

69.64 72.10 A: then they should you know 

72.33 75.71 A: read it at home instead of watching t._v. 

73.62 74.50 B: yes 

75.44 76.49 B: mhm 

76.31 82.01 A: you know um i think there's too much um things that children could do now 

82.03 85.67 A: in school that you know as we grew up 

85.73 87.35 A: we could not do 

87.13 88.26 B: right 

87.94 95.30 A: and um you know part of it's the teachers and everything but a lot of it is the uh school system 

95.54 100.10 A: you know they just well a lot of teachers out here 

100.25 103.57 A: are in it for the pay check and that's it 

102.75 104.09 B: where do you live 

103.70 104.81 A: colorado 

104.72 105.92 B: oh colorado 

105.76 107.12 A: yes you 

105.95 107.41 B: i'm in california 

107.16 108.06 A: are you 

107.82 109.11 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

108.62 110.66 A: (( yes so )) 

110.48 125.15 A: you know and i think there ought to be books that these children do read but they don't read 'em you know i remember growing up flower for algernon was one of them that we had to read 

125.21 136.23 A: and none of my children have ever read that you know they're reading joke books and everything else and the teacher's oh that's fine they're reading like [mn] no you know 

127.71 128.46 B: mm 

133.96 134.91 B: yes 

137.08 139.58 A: they don't learn nothing 

138.54 141.71 B: no they need to read things that have some depth to them 

142.43 146.79 B: i just think it you know it really um even a lot of the subjects 

142.65 144.15 A: right 

147.17 152.10 B: or books that i've run across in school over the school years with my kids um 

152.86 155.22 B: are either topics i don't want them to 

155.53 156.52 B: uh 

157.37 164.58 B: get into it all or they're topics that i want to deal with the [mn] the subject matter and not have as a class participation thing 

158.26 160.06 A: mhm 

164.52 166.21 A: (( right )) 

165.20 172.32 B: and uh [mn] you know basically [mn] like i said i think the whole censorship concept 

172.40 185.37 B: when it hits the news media is so distorted because you're not saying that it's forever you can't do or read a certain thing you're saying in this is in this setting it's not appropriate in at this time or whatever 

185.19 190.09 A: right and it's not you know and then there's some that's not educational 

190.03 197.58 A: you know we're sending them to school to learn an education and you know if they would read some 

197.43 209.36 A: of the more classic books or the older books that are around that make their mind think more than what they do you know with some of the newer books that are coming out and you know like you said some of the 

203.62 204.59 B: mhm 

209.52 211.48 A: age appropriate books 

211.49 212.71 B: mhm 

212.10 220.53 A: um you know you got young ones reading you know stuff that even high schools shouldn't read 

220.18 221.57 B: yeah i agree 

221.76 222.46 B: i 

223.83 225.45 B: i've uh [sigh] 

226.86 233.27 B: had to go to task [mn] several times on it and [mn] and it's always it's always been that 

233.48 243.29 B: it should they should keep it in and then if you don't want your kid to sign it they several times i've had teachers send home notices to give permission to read a certain book 

243.07 245.48 A: right 

243.70 248.71 B: um usually usually that happens after somebody a parent has voiced an objection 

248.61 250.12 A: right 

249.28 250.35 B: and um 

251.47 256.49 B: you know i'm all for i'm all for the parents being that involved [laughter] 

256.31 262.05 A: oh i am too you know i think more parents ought to be involved in what their children are reading i mean 

257.48 258.25 B: so 

261.04 262.50 B: mhm 

262.58 268.08 A: you look at it you know from colorado we had that columbine shooting and everything 

267.58 268.99 B: mhm yeah yeah 

268.29 275.29 A: and you know the child was reading books on bombs and in the on the internet you know reading 

275.57 286.94 A: um you know maybe not just [mn] the books being censored but the internet being censored more and more you know parents give their kids the full right to uh 

281.91 283.22 B: mhm 

286.88 298.82 A: the internet and to what to read up on that and you know that's a tough subject too you know because they're reading books on bombs and things like that 

291.14 292.14 B: yes 

299.17 302.50 A: and you know i feel that things ought to be censored 

303.30 309.62 A: and um [cough] excuse me that they ought to be censored 

306.99 308.07 B: mhm 

309.73 314.11 A: and that the teachers ought to be paying attention as to what these kids are reading 

314.35 315.31 B: yes 

314.77 317.65 A: you know and if it's not age appropriate or 

317.77 321.17 A: something like that then they ought to be uh 

321.67 326.31 A: you know told no you can't read this and notify the parents and let them know 

326.19 327.98 B: yes mhm 

326.46 329.41 A: you know i told your parent i told your child no 

329.88 332.57 A: they can't do that 

331.33 332.59 B: definitely 

332.67 333.68 A: so 

333.31 340.13 B: i think one uh other thing that is frequently a part of this [mn] of this particular type of issue 

340.22 342.85 B: that always has gotten me so upset is 

343.12 349.90 B: is the fact that it's a it's a double standard when when they the lib- well i shouldn't say liberal but when the 

350.08 358.65 B: the people that are pro these children m- making their own choice about subject matters and things that they still obviously need guidance for 

358.50 359.65 A: right 

358.87 361.85 B: and and [mn] and covering 

362.46 365.16 B: [mn] parental covering or authority covering 

365.07 366.34 A: right 

365.67 377.48 B: then when they want to promote it they say the child should have the right and so forth but then when when the child gets you know if they teenagers and gets into trouble then all of a sudden the child is a child 

377.47 378.57 A: right 

377.55 382.73 B: and and shouldn't be considered under adult law and shouldn't be considered 

382.74 385.12 B: uh capable of 

385.20 390.53 B: consequence for actions because they're a child so that has always really frustrated me 

387.81 388.87 A: right 

390.91 393.91 B: uh because it's such a double it's hypocrisy 

391.06 392.67 A: (( yes )) 

393.78 396.96 A: right it is double standards you know um 

397.81 402.65 A: the child doesn't need to um you know do what they 

402.94 412.70 A: want to do you know and a lot of it the parents oh well you know he's a teenager now so he can you know he understands what adults are talking about 

412.00 413.48 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

413.40 427.62 A: you know that was the biggest thing is you know when i grew up [mn] i didn't know my parents' bills situation and everything and they do it today you know oh yeah my child knows [mn] you know it's like you know let him grow up and have fun 

427.40 428.76 B: yeah 

428.46 430.36 A: you know um 

429.29 433.22 B: yeah it is definitely different considerably different you know 

432.44 435.85 A: yes yes it is and 

434.40 442.54 B: and i don't think a lot of it's in good ways some of it may be but but a lot of it is i think unhealthy for the kids 

436.99 437.89 A: no 

442.36 445.26 A: i think so and you know i don't think um 

446.21 448.96 A: it's you know i don't think the kids 

449.60 455.80 A: they see it but you know and they want to change it but they don't want to change it because nobody really cares 

455.76 457.10 B: yes that's right 

455.91 464.96 A: you know got a lot you know there used to be a term latchkey kids and you don't hear that anymore because 

460.68 461.78 B: yes 

463.44 465.12 B: no you you don't do you 

465.04 469.00 A: no ninety percent of the people are home alone 

468.65 469.70 B: uh-huh 

469.60 472.23 A: you know um i know 

472.68 479.24 A: um i [mn] work at home so our children aren't home alone but uh 

476.87 477.83 B: uh-huh 

478.21 482.05 B: and i stay home ours are not home either alone [laughter] 

481.19 483.83 A: [mn] right but you know 

483.89 493.41 A: to hear somebody say oh my mom or my dad you know's at home when i'm at home is really very uncommon 

492.78 494.53 B: yes it is anymore 

494.24 498.49 A: you know um now there's times that i'm not home you know 

498.53 501.07 A: but i'm home shortly thereafter 

500.96 501.93 B: yes 

501.67 506.35 A: you know but to have 'em stay in you know parents are working later and later 

506.40 507.66 B: mhm 

506.59 509.73 A: and with traffic and everything these kids are staying home 

509.86 511.42 A: twice as much 

511.69 514.85 A: as a latchkey kid has ever stayed home 

515.35 518.52 A: you know so it's [mn] 

515.55 516.32 B: (( yeah )) 

518.67 523.41 A: you know they ought to ban some things in school 

523.74 526.89 A: but then the parents need to say okay you know 

527.65 535.37 A: you need to do this also we have a rule they homework has to be done before anything you know and um 

532.67 533.81 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

537.32 542.50 A: we know what they're reading at home and everything else like that so 

539.17 541.10 B: yes mhm 

542.87 545.33 A: it's not a surprise to us 

545.27 546.08 B: yeah 

545.43 550.61 A: and you know like i said we have a boy that's in high uh junior high 

550.32 551.29 B: (( uh yeah )) 

550.62 555.60 A: and he brings home these joke books and i tell him no you're not reading these 

555.67 566.66 A: you can read em for fun but well we're supposed to read i said well then you get a book that you can read yeah i said you don't need to be sitting here reading joke books [mn] 

561.66 563.17 B: and read yeah 

566.59 570.43 B: yeah because there's no you know they're missing comprehension when they do that 

569.81 583.70 A: oh yeah yeah and they're missing you know [laughter] you get a book you know even like gone with the wind you have to think about and visualize it you can't just um 

571.11 572.05 B: i mean 

577.94 578.95 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

583.96 590.31 A: you know read a para- or read a sentence and for- you know not have no visualization or anything 

590.55 595.51 A: so yeah it's it's tough and i think they ought to um 

595.72 596.63 A: you know 

597.10 599.95 A: censor some of the books that are in school
