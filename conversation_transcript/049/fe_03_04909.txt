0.91 2.06 B: hello 

2.12 2.94 A: (( hello )) 

3.06 4.16 B: yes hello 

3.85 4.76 A: hi 

5.25 7.50 A: hi my name is fazon what's your name 

6.09 9.24 B: my name is roger how you 

9.11 11.43 A: hi roger um 

9.61 12.92 B: (( doing )) 

11.48 14.17 A: and uh what what part of the country you in 

14.22 16.63 B: i'm in ah san francisco 

16.39 18.43 A: oh great i'm in uh l._a. 

18.23 19.74 B: l._a. okay 

19.06 23.95 A: well great so um uh random drug testing is that the topic 

20.06 21.95 B: all right 

23.53 24.75 B: yes uh-huh 

24.41 28.10 A: okay um so i guess uh 

28.42 40.37 A: you know in general i i think it's a it i think it depends on the place or um you know uh and and especially what kind of work there certainly could be 

32.04 36.76 B: (( uh-huh )) 

40.88 45.36 A: reason i think of maybe truck drivers for example 

44.15 46.08 B: exactly yes uh-huh 

46.08 47.52 A: certainly uh 

47.75 50.84 A: commercial airline pilots i wouldn't mind [laughter] to 

49.58 50.41 B: uh-huh 

51.12 55.20 A: uh so there is so i think when there's certainly the public safety 

51.28 52.31 B: that's right 

55.00 55.96 B: uh-huh 

55.28 56.42 A: um 

56.60 60.54 A: and i think those are those are the kinds of situations where i think it certainly is 

60.40 63.19 B: yes i feel the same way especially the hospital workers yeah 

60.61 61.46 A: uh 

62.91 65.23 A: right yeah that 

63.63 66.53 B: (( you know where you got the [laughter] )) 

65.70 69.26 A: that's right pharmacists uh exactly 

67.28 68.75 B: pharmacists yes 

68.98 70.89 B: nurses and 

70.27 72.01 A: right right 

71.21 72.06 B: uh-huh 

72.08 78.82 A: um i think it's harder um in those situations like uh you know where high schools want to do that 

78.37 79.87 B: exactly yes 

79.49 80.73 A: (( um )) 

80.74 82.39 A: and uh 

82.58 92.64 A: um you know and i certainly i have i have teenagers so there certainly is sometimes i guess while you certainly trust your children there are those times when you wanna 

89.59 90.30 B: (( yes )) 

92.95 94.80 B: that's right 

93.25 102.19 A: keep them on their toes but no we've we've certainly never done that but that would be something to a lot of people have thought about that or have even done it so 

96.73 97.50 B: uh-huh 

98.00 101.01 B: yeah that's right 

101.75 102.65 B: uh-huh 

102.64 106.77 A: but uh i would- i don't i wouldn't want my school doing that yeah 

105.80 113.02 B: uh-huh that's right the only thing i ever tried was the aspirin that's it [laughter] yeah 

110.67 120.65 A: [laughter] well that's right i mean you know and again it doesn't really what one particularly does you just know that there are lots of people who don't do the same thing that you do 

113.52 117.92 B: (( yeah )) 

120.49 122.90 B: (( no that's right )) 

120.83 128.31 A: and that's uh you know we're the you know we're certainly the same way not in not involved in anything like that and even you know 

124.24 125.88 B: yep 

128.51 135.84 A: we don't uh i i'm in the same place where i don't um we don't usually take any regular medications and no 

130.11 133.49 B: (( yeah )) 

135.25 136.79 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

135.92 148.39 A: um uh no medications that would make you drowsy or anything like that but there are lots of people who um you know who who are just not using their their head 

139.51 142.04 B: exactly yeah 

148.02 149.80 B: exactly yes uh-huh 

148.98 151.74 A: i um i actually went to a um 

152.30 161.17 A: a friend of mine was a had a a driving school you know the one of those things that where if you get stuck uh sorry 

157.11 157.96 B: uh-huh 

161.47 163.45 A: convicted of d._u._i. 

163.25 164.53 B: oh d._u._i. wow 

163.62 170.57 A: uh uh he was he ran this uh school for those for d._u._i. drunk drivers 

165.92 169.22 B: (( yeah )) 

169.82 170.75 B: uh-huh 

170.56 180.81 A: and uh one of the things that we uh would talk about or at least one of the i i actually went i was gonna be a trainer with him once and so i went to this one session and 

175.17 175.83 B: (( mm )) 

178.39 179.18 B: uh-huh 

180.83 193.30 A: he uh had uh an exercise early on where he asked each of the each of the people there uh about you know ten fifteen people to go around and and reconstruct their day 

184.90 187.62 B: (( uh-huh )) 

193.09 194.23 B: uh-huh 

193.80 196.98 A: on the day that they uh got their ticket 

196.02 197.72 B: uh-huh 

197.25 206.80 A: and uh you know it was not unusual and not uncommon for people to wake up and drink and wake up and do drugs 

203.01 205.39 B: uh-huh that's true 

206.44 207.19 B: (( yes )) 

206.91 219.98 A: and they didn't get popped until maybe ten eleven at night after a full day of non stop drinking and uh so those are you know there's no doubt that uh 

209.21 210.00 B: uh-huh 

211.57 213.22 B: (( yeah )) 

213.28 214.15 B: uh-huh 

215.90 216.91 B: (( yep )) 

220.24 221.40 A: (( um )) 

221.44 228.11 A: yeah there's no safety in thinking well people have wi- will use their best judgement or or use of their brains 

227.90 228.74 B: uh-huh 

230.51 242.45 B: that's true yeah i feel the same way yeah i went to a traffic school myself before and uh you know they also talk about you know stuff like that not the drugs but you know their effect on what you did and you know 

231.36 232.21 A: yeah 

242.27 243.55 A: that's right 

243.08 246.81 B: yeah and we reflect on the like the not even the topics in a similar way too 

246.78 247.94 A: that's right 

247.64 252.15 B: (( yeah that's all the yeah yeah )) 

249.15 250.46 A: that's right 

252.46 254.32 B: (( so the )) 

254.49 261.33 B: yeah even the now even the sars the effect just driving from the drugs to cure it and they're trying to figure out what's going on too 

261.81 263.81 A: say that again i'm sorry say again 

261.91 264.74 B: (( you know the the sa- the sars )) 

264.98 272.71 B: on the yeah yeah sars yeah now they're looking for the drugs to uh you know fix the cure and hopefully they'll find good drugs to fix it you know 

265.03 266.67 A: oh the sars 

266.85 268.21 A: oh right 

272.40 286.43 A: yeah well that's interesting i haven't i actually never even think about that in terms of what kinds of inter- you know interventions they were they were using but sure um you know any of those things that would 

273.09 274.88 B: yeah 

275.90 277.77 B: yeah 

278.06 279.72 B: (( yeah )) 

281.45 282.77 B: yeah 

283.01 284.18 B: yep 

286.22 291.13 A: uh like i guess like those you know uh super powerful nyquil or something that would 

290.11 292.71 B: nyquil exactly 

290.98 298.04 A: help someone feel better um you know certainly could uh while people are trying to i mean i guess the the 

296.42 299.51 B: (( yeah )) 

297.90 310.46 A: the the connection there is that while people don't mean to cause any harm i think uh often about the fact that you know even at at my place of work 

300.05 300.97 B: uh-huh 

304.72 305.58 B: uh-huh 

310.28 323.39 A: you know like we have uh which is you know i mean it's it's it's like an educational setting but but you know people don't want to miss work they don't want to take their sick days and so they will you know uh 

310.29 311.22 B: uh-huh 

315.77 316.64 B: uh-huh 

320.46 321.63 B: exactly 

322.89 324.55 B: yeah 

323.45 335.56 A: do what they have to do take you know take a a cold medication or something like that uh just so that they can stay working or keep working and uh it's those kinds of situations where 

327.11 328.88 B: cold medic- yes uh-huh 

331.04 333.60 B: exactly yeah 

334.94 336.68 B: (( yeah )) 

335.57 336.72 A: um 

337.03 338.59 A: you know well you know 

338.04 342.30 B: (( yeah )) 

338.86 343.60 A: where you want you want that to uh you want to know about that 

342.92 344.80 B: exactly 

343.49 355.57 A: um but again i i think that in my in my workplace for example which is you know a basic office setting i don't i couldn't really see um any kind of um 

347.96 348.80 B: uh-huh 

350.82 351.71 B: uh-huh 

355.61 359.29 A: any real justification for random drug testing 

358.80 361.07 B: that's true yeah 

359.36 360.40 A: (( um )) 

360.48 364.06 A: you know uh how unless of course 

361.32 363.04 B: yeah 

364.00 365.01 B: uh-huh 

364.08 370.35 A: um we work with students and if i had if my staff were driving students then certainly it would be 

368.42 369.35 B: uh-huh 

370.42 371.60 A: (( um )) 

371.68 378.59 A: um you know it would be a kind of precaution especially in terms of our own liability 

378.26 379.15 B: uh-huh 

378.62 384.56 A: uh to want to want to protect um the company and also as well as protect the kids 

382.22 385.55 B: that's that's right yeah 

384.90 385.85 A: so 

385.64 386.20 B: (( mm )) 

385.97 393.70 B: yeah i fe- i feel the same way for just uh you know it depends on the type of uh occupation whether that we should like check for the drugs i think it's 

393.58 401.57 B: it's good to check everybody for drugs but uh depends on you know what kind of thing you gonna be if you gonna be by yourself working and not bothering anybody it's okay but uh 

401.58 411.83 B: yeah but uh it depends on if obviously gonna be work as any kind of food or even people or something something that's gonna bother everybody then you know even there's the even of strong cold medicine you should've been taking 

406.26 407.05 A: right 

411.71 412.58 A: that's right 

411.92 415.39 B: yeah i feel the same way yeah 

412.63 413.56 A: yeah 

413.77 421.20 A: that's right a real a real uh concern for the safety of others yeah you're right yeah 

418.14 424.17 B: basic yes uh-huh definitely you can get lo- lot of people in trouble not just yourself but uh 

424.25 427.62 B: yeah that's right yeah 

424.79 426.58 A: that's true that's true 

429.15 435.65 A: what and uh what kind of uh you know what kind of workplace are you in what kind of thing do you what kind of work do you do 

435.15 438.19 B: well myself right now i'm i'm a cook right now

457.89 470.39 A: well that's you but but i can see you know given what you were talking about in terms of sars and and being in a situation where in fact you could really affect a lot of people um that makes 

461.89 464.60 B: yeah exactly 

467.71 475.91 B: exactly yeah 'cause if you yeah even uh you know all the drugs really uh affect the so they cooking for customers you know

530.40 532.91 A: okay so she was at the convention center 

532.69 540.03 B: the convention center and uh my wife my wife was also saying that uh lot of uh you know stuff they use for the people's hair is a lot of chemicals 

533.70 534.54 A: right 

540.11 541.05 A: right 

540.12 544.46 B: so so she said it's not good for the you know for your hair and skin so 

543.81 550.08 A: well that's right and and i was just going to say you're right cosmetology is another area where you'd want

548.60 551.76 B: yeah they breathing a lot a yeah 

550.62 557.95 A: you'd want to be very careful especially if there was some sort of interaction between the drugs and the chemicals that you had to work with 

553.46 554.29 B: yeah 

556.19 563.32 B: yeah and she says she has to breathe in the chemicals every day so it's bad for her lungs like smoking a cigarette or something you know 

562.55 565.63 A: oh there there's no doubt about it that's right yeah 

563.56 571.92 B: yeah that's why i told her just uh you know whenever you spray the chemicals you know make sure keep your don't breathe in too hard you know 

571.81 572.87 A: [laughter] 

571.97 577.79 B: keep it away from you just to spray on person's hair but uh you know that's why they need to come out with the natural things more 

577.56 578.55 A: yeah 

577.91 580.83 B: yeah natural hair spray or something 

579.98 586.17 A: yeah well that's i mean and that's good i don't but i think those things are uh more expensive than the synthetic 

581.19 582.83 B: yeah 

585.77 587.97 B: oh yeah definitely yes 

586.64 589.32 A: you know the the natural products are 

588.80 589.79 B: uh-huh 

589.33 594.28 A: good for you but they also charge you a lot which is really hard uh 

591.55 599.89 B: exactly yeah even the natural medicine nowadays uh i mean they they work but you have to take three or four of them more than the regular 

599.29 599.89 A: right
