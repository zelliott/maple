239.67 247.78 A: live every day without water the body gets the water from the food you eat can you believe that so a lot of this stuff you hear it's 

244.30 245.87 B: (( mhm )) 

248.51 251.85 A: before you believe it [laughter] you better do the research 

252.31 265.16 A: i don't know if you have showtime and stuff but man they showed me some things over there that i was like i couldn't believe it i'll give you one short example because this is not about the subject you know you know how everybody believes that we are destroying the planet and we are destroying the forests 

260.47 262.20 B: [sigh] mhm yeah go ahead 

265.38 266.24 B: yeah 

265.66 270.83 A: well according to what it's a new show by panatela it's called uh 

271.36 278.76 A: i ain't going to say the name it's like nasty b. s. for short okay so i don't say the whole name that's what it's called 

275.65 276.78 B: mhm 

278.77 279.63 B: uh-huh 

279.29 290.44 A: and they said that uh no we're not destroying any forests and we're not killing the planet and blah blah blah and i was like wow you know everybody believes that right but it [laughter] it [laughter] 

290.48 293.68 A: before you believe any stories you gotta really do your homework you know 

293.76 296.86 B: [sigh] well yeah it's it's um 

297.39 306.61 B: the the global warming you know it seems there was quite a difference in the presidential debates on that president go- uh you know uh presidential candidate gore was thinking that uh 

306.97 317.01 B: that uh we that it the global warming was harmful and he was quite kind of a good student of of uh global warming and he'd written books on how we're harming harming the environment and trying to keep the earth 

317.00 325.02 B: the earth uh quality good and safe for future generations but there and but then bush was like you know i don't think he said much about it but he obviously doesn't care they broke the kyoto 

319.79 321.83 A: oh you know what 

324.92 336.08 B: they had that they had that international agreement with all the nations all the nations in the world sort of believed that and they signed that agreement saying that they'd you know take a lot of steps to protect the environment and we the united states 

336.35 349.61 B: things what things things what you just said and at least some people in the united states there's like a faction of people that are more concerned with getting with improving like uh you know with improving certain with continuing certain sorts of develop- development 

349.56 360.52 B: instead of switching to like some of the cleaner and cleaner fuels and that sort of thing but anyway you know i think i suppose we're supposed to be talking about exercise but yeah i i i know there's a little bit of a debate about that one but it just sort of seem mhm 

354.01 354.97 A: listen 

358.26 363.00 A: oh let me let me add one more thing about clean air uh 

363.79 375.77 A: i don't know if you ever heard about this or re- or read about it somewhere but uh they can make a car- actually they made it already it's not like they don't produce it how do you say in mass quantities yet 

367.20 368.98 B: mhm 

375.64 377.34 B: mass production yeah uh-huh 

375.86 377.24 A: but that's the future 

377.43 379.82 A: that's the future and check this out uh 

379.92 381.72 A: (( this car the )) 

383.50 385.97 A: the emission you know it emits 

386.04 391.50 A: instead of the deadly carbon monoxide you call it or something like that okay 

389.50 390.65 B: yeah uh-huh 

391.78 392.83 A: uh 

393.51 399.39 A: the only thing that comes out of the car is pure natural drinking water you ever heard that 

399.85 413.56 B: no but you could you imagine trying to kill yourself by committing suicide in the garage by turn by sitting in your car and instead of like you dying from carbon monoxide you'd drown you know how people like to turn the car on and sit in the garage to commit suicide 

412.94 418.51 A: [laughter] why do they do that [laughter] how did you come up with such an idea out of all of a sudden 

418.82 424.09 B: i don't know i don't know how it happened exactly i can't trace my neural pathways 

421.64 424.94 A: wait a minute you're you're saying that something like this happened already 

425.31 426.08 B: [sigh] 

425.96 432.87 B: no but i was thinking that if you were in the garage and you were and your goal was to commit suicide sometimes people will turn on their turn on the um 

432.76 447.14 B: you know they turn their car on and the carbon monoxide there like you it disappear the car the carbon monoxide will fill up in the garage or you can repipe it back into the car into the passenger seat and i guess car i guess death by carbon monoxide by that sort of it's called asphyxiation um it it's sort of a 

447.50 455.35 B: it tends to be less painful than like you know you don't want to stab yourself and taking pills it goes really slowly or or it'd be kinda traumatic but 

454.53 457.13 A: oh you think that's a dying you'd don't 

455.46 457.20 B: nobody wants to shoot themselves 

457.08 459.83 B: yeah but if you had one of those cars you could do it but you 

459.78 474.20 B: you'd you'd have to you'd be sitting there and you'd be watching the water you'd be watching the water level you for you know for all the good it's going to do you might as well take a you might as well take a faucet and turn it and take a faucet to the hose and pull that in the car and then let the water level rise up in the car and drown 

461.31 464.25 A: have to have a car do it [laughter] you don't have to 

473.08 476.57 A: exactly you don't need a car like that i mean the whole point 

475.11 478.52 B: [laughter] 

477.06 480.65 A: you can also drown yourself in the ocean trust me i 

479.02 484.27 B: [laughter] exactly right yeah exactly and also the car would work well enough to get you to the ocean 

484.28 492.83 A: [laughter] no no no the whole point of this car is that the air is going to be perfectly clean you know someday it's not going to be 

484.29 487.86 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

487.94 489.72 B: [laughter] 

490.86 492.05 B: yeah 

493.06 496.66 A: but uh i i don't know when they're going to like replace [mn] 

495.07 496.74 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

496.87 501.29 B: yeah so anyway we're we're talking exercise here and that kind of thing and uh 

499.98 507.95 A: oh you know what we already how do you say stopped talking about it so we might as well [laughter] i don't know if we get 

504.29 511.58 B: [laughter] yeah if the fisher study doesn't like if the fisher study doesn't like it they can call you know but you want to think that um 

511.55 518.14 B: that you know there's two different kinds of exercises aerobic and anaerobic exercise like there's the kind that's good for your heart and there's the kind that's good for your muscles 

518.02 525.09 B: and the kind of you know lifting things and moving things around more like guy kind of stuff you know that kind you know like where you where you lift weights or you or you i 

524.97 537.17 B: don't know if you have the kind of a job where if you have do kind of activities in life where where you have to like use your bo- use your muscles that kind of stuff is kinda good for you also but it isn't you know most most of the time most of the exercise apart from weightlifting 

537.04 550.50 B: that's going to go on out there tends to be good for your heart you know like walking bicycling um mo- you to some extent swimming a lot of the stuff that you know jogging a lot of stuff that you see people doing out there during you know for exercise is is one form of exercise 

550.43 555.86 B: but you know the strength exercises are good exercises too you know just to build up your strength to build up your body strength 

555.77 566.48 B: most of those things are good and it help it helps to like i think it helps sort of like in psychological ways too if you feel like your body will do whatever it is you want it to do because you've built up your body a little bit in terms of the strength you know mm 

565.37 566.34 A: you know 

566.39 577.13 A: you know i believe that uh a lot of people they over exercise like running coupla miles every day [laughter] that's over exercising no way jose or lifting weights that's forcing 

571.64 573.50 B: mhm 

575.69 582.17 B: yeah well it depends to some extent how how what uh you know your age level and that too that don't they don't like if you're like 

582.21 594.29 B: over fifty or sixty or something they they probably don't really do you know you get heart attack running that running that ha- running like that but if you're you know if you're a young if you're a young kid a mile or two's probably isn't going to hurt you very much might be good for you a bit 

593.91 595.57 A: you know that uh 

595.07 598.78 B: i'm sort of in the middle there somewhere in terms of how much i should exert myself 

598.46 599.89 A: you know that a lot of
