36.51 37.79 B: right 

37.18 38.40 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

38.77 41.77 A: i started playing racquetball coupla weeks or a coupla months ago 

41.42 42.52 B: oh that's great 

42.49 46.17 A: and uh my wife is actually an aerobics instructor 

46.45 47.36 B: okay 

46.50 47.66 A: or a a 

47.81 52.39 A: a fitness instructor i guess i shouldn't say aerobics teaches a bunch of different things lot of stuff in the pool so 

52.04 53.06 B: mhm 

52.46 58.28 A: i have access to the health club through her but i've just never been one to really enjoy going to health clubs 

58.18 61.75 B: [laughter] do you find that that she uh encourages you 

60.99 64.98 A: [laughter] why yes as a matter of fact she does 

64.52 65.72 B: yeah i bet 

65.51 66.42 A: (( uh )) 

67.01 69.98 B: i was working at a physical therapy clinic um 

69.61 70.77 A: oh yeah 

70.07 78.72 B: about a year ago and you know everybody there has got a is real regimented is in terms of fitness you know including the therapists and the technicians 

76.10 76.96 A: uh-huh 

78.88 82.98 B: but you know there's the occasional one that that you know will 

83.24 91.21 B: even working with people all day long um concerning like exercise and and and therapy they won't really have any interest themselves [lipsmack] 

86.85 87.68 A: uh-huh 

90.60 91.83 A: mhm 

91.35 92.61 B: in doing 

92.16 94.17 A: and that but that's pretty unusual 

93.90 95.59 B: it ki- kinda of yeah 

94.77 96.04 A: in that profession 

95.62 96.97 B: i think it is 

97.19 104.30 B: um everybody i've seen has has been real interested in fitness i guess just because you know they can they see [sigh] 

104.47 108.05 B: you know what age will do to you or what uh an accident will do to you 

107.70 109.17 A: right 

108.74 112.69 B: racquetball's great though i um i try and play tennis um 

113.00 122.92 B: fairly frequently um there's just an open court out here and um i i think that i think that i would really enjoy racquetball a lot more 

122.61 125.91 A: now are you you're where you can play tennis year round or 

125.99 127.01 B: yes 

127.01 132.08 A: 'cause i know i i mean i don't i assume all parts of california aren't warm all the time 

131.52 139.50 B: no you're you're totally right um the southern part down here i i [laughter] i don't even know if the uh climate really fluctuates that much 

139.56 141.61 B: down here i just moved out here actually 

141.23 142.23 A: oh yeah 

141.68 151.89 B: but my friend who's been here for three years um just every time i call them or every time i called them in the past was always talking about blue skies and no clouds no rain or anything 

151.34 153.56 A: and so that's what you're experiencing 

153.16 158.18 B: which is a pretty different um which is pretty different than i'm from virginia originally but 

157.57 158.95 A: yeah 

158.97 161.86 B: um i i tried racquetball once 

161.47 162.34 A: uh-huh 

161.90 167.02 B: when i was in college and it is so intense 

166.74 169.07 A: yeah yeah 

168.57 180.86 B: i i really i found myself you know struggling to find foot placement um unable to really reach some of these balls i mean my opponent just crushed me 

178.21 178.98 A: uh-huh 

180.39 183.27 A: yeah well like anything though the more you do it 

183.36 190.39 A: i mean the better you get they have a a they organize leagues here and uh so they try to put you with people that are kinda in your 

191.12 194.20 A: uh with your same level 

193.72 195.15 B: mhm 

194.43 199.80 A: but um i i mean that makes a big difference too 'cause you want to play someone that's not going to cream ya 

199.60 200.62 B: definitely 

200.03 205.52 A: but then on the other hand you don't want to just be walking over the other people too so it's worked out pretty good 

204.97 209.00 B: are you part of is it is it a racquetball club or is it something with the gym 

208.73 221.58 A: no it's something at the at the health club there then they've got a couple of racquetball courts so one of the one of the uh promoters or whatever they are they put together leagues that run about twelve weeks 

211.01 211.91 B: okay 

219.15 220.20 B: mhm 

221.78 226.69 A: and uh you're supposed to play every week but what i've found it's really really difficult to get 

227.26 230.61 A: um people that will play i mean uh uh 

229.51 230.55 B: (( mm definitely )) 

231.00 245.83 A: people drop out because of injury or 'cause of some other reason and then there's just you know you'd think you'd be able to make one night a week or one day during the week but it's been very very hard to get people that you know want to want to go ahead and fulfil the commitment 

239.78 240.62 B: mhm 

245.26 248.24 B: i bet is the league a all ages league 

248.41 249.37 A: oh yeah 

249.80 263.45 A: yeah i mean there's they do have a separate women's league but you don't have to be in that i mean that's just their choice otherwise it's just open to whoever wants to play whatever age i mean i've played everything from high school kid to uh 

252.30 253.50 B: mhm 

263.61 265.86 A: you know older older people too 

266.01 266.63 B: (( mm )) 

266.62 271.73 A: probably in their fifties so and that doesn't [laughter] you know i've seen some of these grey haired old men 

271.75 275.41 A: that could wipe the floor with me i mean they're just they're just incredible 

273.30 274.28 B: oh yeah 

275.98 279.48 A: i just like this work 'cause it's so um it's pretty easy 

279.08 280.46 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

279.80 282.22 A: and uh i mean even uh 

282.73 286.44 A: you know even a novice can pick it up pretty easy i mean the rules are very simple and 

285.85 287.28 B: mhm 

286.93 289.37 A: and uh it's just a lot of fun 

289.24 290.82 B: do you play tennis at all too 

290.86 294.45 A: i haven't i haven't been on a tennis court since high school i think 

293.99 294.86 B: okay 

294.61 296.26 A: [laughter] 

295.64 297.95 B: yeah i um 

298.01 300.69 B: my brother was just out here and he um 

301.13 302.80 B: he brought he bought me this 

302.86 309.20 B: really nice pair of shoes for tennis i wonder if um i wonder if the shoes are the same for those two sports 

305.02 305.89 A: uh-huh 

308.82 309.80 A: i don't know 

309.49 313.92 B: i i got some it was like just regular like k. swiss they're 

314.48 319.15 B: they're really nice do you do you just do you wear whatever to play that 

318.32 323.77 A: well i'm not as i said i'm not real competitive i mean i just wear a pair of tennis shoes that fits 

324.34 337.87 B: i guess the problem uh what i was thinking about though is 'cause um i was playing before he got me those with just some running shoes which i would think would be all right but after playing about uh three weeks they they were coming apart 

331.04 332.07 A: mhm 

337.29 338.10 A: oh 

338.00 342.06 B: the sole and even like the binding was just peeling off 

341.47 345.26 A: yeah well i would see i mean if it was strictly a running shoe 

345.27 347.93 A: they'd probably be designed differently than a court shoe 

347.61 349.41 B: mhm 

348.49 350.23 A: i mean just the way they're used 

350.37 353.42 B: do you ever try and get into the the weight room and all 

353.08 362.12 A: [lipsmack] um i did also start that um about uh eight weeks ago that really they've got free they've got uh some weight machines and so i've started to do 

362.33 363.26 A: um 

363.27 366.93 A: like three times a week doing a weight routine and then 

364.69 365.50 B: mhm 

367.90 369.43 A: either a skiing 

369.76 373.94 A: uh like an audit track swimming or a biking 

373.96 376.21 A: uh regimen three times a week 

375.00 377.41 B: boy that is excellent 

377.52 383.88 A: well like i said i'm not as [laughter] i mean i'm not [laughter] it sounds excellent but i just haven't been as consistent as i want to be 

383.35 384.73 B: mhm 

384.18 399.11 A: so uh but i've done i've certainly done i mean i if i look at my life let's say in the past year i've probably been able to be more consistent this past year than i have been in the you know fifteen years before that so i'm encouraged by that and i'm not going to beat up on myself and i'll just uh 

394.85 395.96 B: mhm 

399.01 400.33 A: keep plugging away 

400.17 405.91 B: yeah well that yeah that's probably the the best thing i i know that when you beat up on yourself and you 

405.93 406.84 B: [laughter] 

406.99 413.19 B: you you start to feel like guilty about not going it doesn't really help with anything at all 

409.54 410.39 A: mhm 

411.75 412.58 A: right 

413.43 415.15 B: uh i know i i 

415.33 423.66 B: i'm kind of in the same boat as soon as i came out here i realized that um southern california is a place where people love to stay in shape 

423.10 424.27 A: oh yeah 

423.70 432.67 B: they they love to jog um they love to go to the gym and it's also a lot more convenient to walk around the city um 

431.27 432.27 A: mhm 

433.01 442.46 B: or you know there are there are like parks and everything around so with everybody fit i think that there's also i i feel more encouraged to stay fit myself 

441.87 443.26 A: yeah 

443.04 455.84 B: um i will tell you though that the uh the cost of staying fit is is way up there you know they'll charge you a pretty penny to join a gym or to do anything like that you know it's 

451.27 452.92 A: oh yeah 

456.09 458.91 B: you know you have to you have to really 

459.40 462.48 B: i don't know you you have to sacrifice some things i guess 

462.07 463.38 A: (( mhm )) 

462.63 468.21 B: for that but i think that it's i think that it's well worth it um i know that [sigh] 

468.77 481.02 B: it's nice to finally like you were saying be more consistent than in the past it's something that's kind of always been like at at the back of my mind something that i've you know really wanted to do 

473.16 474.08 A: mhm 

479.98 484.27 A: well now when when you play tennis is that part of a club or a 

484.52 498.20 B: i would love to join i would love to join a club but um i think that they're as far as clubs you know they're they're independent um they sound really great though you know it it's just like what you said they'll sign you up with uh other people um that match 

484.54 485.74 A: or a tennis 

491.02 491.92 A: (( mhm )) 

498.24 499.75 B: your skill level 

499.77 506.84 B: um and then you know everybody has their schedule marked down so you could you can always find somebody to play 

504.43 505.36 A: mhm 

506.87 508.03 B: but it's not 

508.65 517.28 B: [mn] i'm part of a gym right now that doesn't have anything like that like in fact it doesn't even really have like a basketball court or pool or anything it's it's not the best facility 

513.55 515.95 A: (( mm [noise] uh-huh )) 

518.22 522.11 B: no i just um i play with my with my two roommates 

522.77 535.64 B: and really like what i like to do is just go out there and have them just hit balls all over the courts just so i can jog a little bit 'cause i i find it incredibly difficult to be motivated to to jog 

529.80 530.63 A: uh-huh 

535.51 537.23 A: oh yeah 

536.89 537.96 B: [laughter] 

537.34 540.14 A: yeah i [laughter] i know exactly what you're talking about 

539.67 547.39 B: and i [sigh] really just like to i don't know i i i guess i've never been a big fan of of running 

547.62 550.89 A: yeah but if you're doing something like you said playing tennis or 

550.30 551.54 B: yeah 

550.96 560.87 A: um if you're doing something playing basketball or something like that it's a to me it's always been much easier to to uh to do something rather than just going through the regimen of doing 

561.35 567.04 A: um like i said sitting on the bike or sitting on a ski machine or [laughter] it just 

561.58 562.95 B: exactly 

566.01 571.46 B: which is why i can't understand i don't know you go to these gyms you see some people spinning 

571.36 572.48 A: mhm 

571.93 575.37 B: and they will spin for a long long time 

574.78 577.29 A: now is that with a group or just on their own you mean 

576.90 578.62 B: um on their own 

578.37 579.81 A: oh well 

579.24 591.46 B: and 'cause i mean i'll sit down and you know i'll i'll be we're in a really small gym members and i'll sit down on a bike um by somebody and they'll have been there a good twenty five minutes before me 

583.62 584.45 A: uh-huh 

591.27 594.68 B: and then stay a long time after me while i'm huffing and puffing 

594.12 595.00 A: (( mhm )) 

594.88 599.89 B: unable to unable to really deal with sitting in that position 

599.38 599.95 A: yeah
