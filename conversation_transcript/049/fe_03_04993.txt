142.51 143.64 A: these phone 

147.24 157.19 A: yeah carefully 'cause like the human body wasn't really designed to do vigorous exercise it was just i don't know people back in 

157.70 168.13 A: back in the days thousands of years ago they were just fit because mostly humans just walked around ran looked for food all that 

167.38 169.53 B: just your daily activities 

168.55 173.81 A: but yeah it's just people are getting lazy sitting in front of the couch 

173.57 186.07 A: watching t._v. and eating most of the time and i don't know that's not too good of a practice and a lot of people do it there's a problem with kids not exercising 

186.05 191.78 A: and there's lots of problems with obesity in public schools and there's all that controversy 

191.80 200.20 A: over like those like waivers that teachers send home about warnings about the child getting obese i don't know 

200.26 201.61 B: yeah 

201.01 203.85 A: not a good sign for society 

204.17 205.42 A: but 

204.47 210.71 B: well the school system has let the kids down too as far as the the school education and stuff goes 

206.96 207.52 A: (( [sigh] )) 

209.55 217.73 A: yeah that's very true and not just physical education but public schools and overall yeah whereas 

213.88 225.83 B: well regular education period yeah but as far as the exercise goes i mean my my seven year old is just now learning to do jumping jacks and he's learning that in wrestling not even in school 

225.50 232.62 A: yeah and the kids shouldn't need physical exercise they're already hyper anyway they run around so much 

232.62 233.58 A: it's just 

233.58 238.55 A: forming good habits to che- teach the children like good health practices you know 

238.51 249.75 A: and teach 'em to ca- like what can happen if they do this and wouldn't do that if they don't eat healthy or what it how it can affect them and the parent should teach the children 

247.57 249.07 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

250.33 254.21 A: try to avoid fatty foods and all that 

255.24 256.92 A: (( chocolate's no good for you no )) 

257.47 259.19 A: good and [laughter] 

257.79 260.73 B: (( [noise] [noise] stay out of the strollers guys [noise] )) 

263.02 267.13 A: and you know in chocolate there's tiny tiny amounts of insects 

267.97 274.54 A: like segments feces and stuff like point zero zero three percent and it's legal too 

274.79 276.33 A: just found that out 

274.82 277.02 B: yeah there is in a lot of foods 

276.96 278.46 A: yeah 

277.87 280.27 B: a a lot of processed foods 

280.98 282.58 A: for example 

282.82 284.30 B: um your meats 

284.17 285.00 A: meats 

284.35 286.29 B: y- your processed meats 

286.45 287.41 B: um 

287.45 294.45 B: depending on where they're processed they have dirt and gravel and [laughter] all that fun stuff in 'em [laughter] 

295.37 299.82 A: yeah that doesn't sound appealing oh well 

298.37 303.11 B: and a lot of a lot of the restaurants uh 

303.32 305.44 B: mostly fast food restaurants 

306.13 315.44 B: um get their meat form overseas because it doesn't have to pass uh the u._s. u._s._d._a. standards it has to pass less l- 

315.62 317.03 B: lower standards 

316.46 318.82 A: lower s- yeah 

317.42 319.73 B: and they can get it a lot cheaper that way 

320.29 326.45 B: and you can look on line and find some of the stuff they do to that that meat and stuff that they it 

320.30 321.64 A: taco bell 

324.99 329.70 A: yeah i heard taco bell uses the cheapest possible meat they can buy i mean 

328.85 332.84 B: it's pretty nasty some of the stuff that you can get a hold of [laughter] 

332.12 334.35 A: yeah yeah i'm sure it is 

333.41 339.25 B: and then people wonder why you know i- it's so why all of a sudden it's so much 

340.06 345.93 B: the in the past five five maybe ten years um 

346.13 351.25 B: fast food has the the fatty content has become so much higher 

352.39 354.98 B: in fast food meals 

355.27 358.15 B: well it's because of the food that they serve 

358.46 359.13 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

358.90 362.61 B: you know no they haven't really changed their menus of the same food 

361.12 374.14 A: mm yeah i mostly agree and people get lazy i mean like you can pay ten bucks go buy enough stuff to make like five burgers and they'd be like exquisite like great compared to what you would pay for ten bucks at macdonalds per se 

372.97 373.70 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

374.41 380.41 A: and it's just i guess people have like it's just the economy people don't have time um 

380.49 382.94 A: 'cause peo- most people have to work 

382.98 388.20 A: nowadays to survive sort of like the recession bush brought upon us 

387.81 388.72 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

388.30 392.19 A: but it's always been like in the united states or and it's 

392.17 406.49 A: i live in l._a. so especially here like everybody has to work everybody's driving around and don't have time but i don't know i think the health issues in exercise and all that comes needs to come from the parent and needs to be taught to the children when they're young 

406.27 407.39 B: yep 

407.29 411.72 A: so times when they can absorb the stuff easily 

410.86 419.30 B: when they're young if you teach 'em good eating habits and don't let 'em sit around all day you know make 'em go outside and play 

419.32 422.07 B: don't let 'em veg out in front of the t._v. 

422.71 429.23 B: you know that's what my seven year old would much rather veg out in front of the t._v. and his game his playstation and 

429.49 431.14 B: all that but 

431.19 435.35 B: i make him stay outside for at least an hour a day unless it's raining and 

433.96 442.83 A: yeah and sometimes helps to social but like and and again there's a of being too social and people take advantage of you and you know 

442.64 444.34 B: you get hurt [laughter] 

443.16 448.45 A: if you're too nice it's weird it's like 'cause you gotta teach 'em the boundaries 

447.52 449.23 B: yep 

448.72 459.25 A: 'cause i personally make friends easily but like they they take advantage of me at times like steal things from me well of course i know who did it but i'm not gonna do 

459.15 467.44 A: hit 'em or read 'em up for it but like it's hard living you know life itself tough not easy 

467.44 468.23 B: yep 

467.58 473.81 A: there's lots of issues gotta teach children the young age gotta absorb 

472.45 480.37 B: and everything everything changes so dramatically from even from day to day and society the way people 

480.68 482.64 B: go about their business 

482.94 485.24 B: you know i had um 

485.61 488.43 B: the l- little boy that used to live down the street 

488.46 495.75 B: got mad because my son wouldn't play with him so he threw a rock at him and you know i had to go get five stitches in my son's head [mn] 

496.07 497.50 B: (( you know and )) 

497.70 503.22 B: i've been trying to teach my son 'cause i have a viol- i have a violent temper i take medication for it 

503.33 514.55 B: and i'm trying real hard to teach my kids not to resort to violence well it was really hard not to say okay now go beat the crap out of him [laughter] and 'cause that's my answer 

513.33 527.62 A: well i think i personally believe that 'cause it's been i've seen it happen to me bad things people do bad things to you you do bad things and this this issue of karma like it all comes back full circle and just like the bible says 

524.32 525.18 B: (( yeah )) 

527.14 528.92 B: the law of three 

527.45 537.08 A: you know like do unto others as you like others to do unto always comes back to them somehow you you you'll notice it if you if you don't hurt anybody and just 

536.99 549.78 A: live with your ideals don't be a hypocrite just be the righteous person you are i think everything will work out in there and that's what i've noticed for me 

549.49 553.86 B: yep the the law of three everything you send out comes back to you times three 

549.85 552.46 A: 'cause i've never tried to 

552.72 566.96 A: yeah 'cause i haven't i i i do sometimes wanna hurt somebody but i control myself because i know i don't wanna get at their level because it's gonna come back to me in the end and i don't want that and things have worked out 

565.22 566.32 B: see and that's what 

566.45 571.62 B: that's what i'm trying really hard to teach my kids but like i said i have um 

572.07 580.76 B: i have a vi- i have a violent temper i i have violent mood swings for no apparent reason i can be sitting watching t._v. and get mad and wanna break things 

580.93 584.22 B: but i take medication for it [laughter] 

583.74 586.44 A: yeah it's just chemicals 

584.52 593.65 B: um and it's really it's really hard to teach my kids not to resort to violence when my whole life that's what the answer has always been for me 

593.77 596.96 B: you know somebody made me mad i'd just go whoop their butt 

597.07 599.89 B: and if somebody did me wrong i'd just go whoop their butt
