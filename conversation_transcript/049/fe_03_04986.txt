145.48 147.89 B: yeah what area of the country are you in 

147.64 149.43 A: [noise] i'm uh in chicago 

148.83 153.54 B: yeah me too suburb's up at uh great america up that way up north 

153.29 156.15 A: oh man we're probably couple blocks away from each other

158.98 161.12 B: okay [laughter] 

161.16 168.74 B: yeah yeah but anyway i do the commute downtown and that's what makes it so hard you know i spend a couple of hours traveling each day and 

168.25 172.10 A: so do you walk from uh the train station then to uh to 

170.42 176.01 B: yeah it's only about two or three blocks you know but in the winter it seems longer but [laughter] 

172.41 173.42 A: oh okay 

175.30 179.26 A: yeah i used to uh i used to work on um michigan avenue 

178.92 179.80 B: uh-huh 

179.41 186.69 A: so that was a [noise] probably about a mile walk each way maybe mile and a half walk from uh from union station you know down madison 

183.60 184.91 B: yeah 

186.14 188.96 B: (( right every day i'm at union station [laughter] )) 

187.78 192.86 A: and back then i was in good health or good shape because uh it was a good walk 

189.90 191.03 B: (( right )) 

192.20 197.71 B: yeah that's a good walk to michigan i just have to go to like uh lasalle street so it's not it's only a few blocks 

197.69 198.61 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

198.32 199.26 B: but 

199.36 204.94 B: you know it helps that my wife is is working out with me a little bit sometimes she can you know 

204.96 209.20 B: kick me in the butt a little bit to go [laughter] when i probably wouldn't by myself 

208.77 222.13 A: [noise] [noise] yeah that's even tougher though when you have kids because one of you has to stay back and watch the kids so you're kinda i think you're kinda at an advantage there if you bo- both can workout together just kind of a way to spend some quality time together 

214.11 216.04 B: right you're they're young huh 

219.01 220.07 B: right 

221.44 227.62 B: yeah i don't know that it's that great a quality but we've we've been doin' pretty good [laughter] 

222.46 223.83 A: [noise] would you uh 

226.79 230.92 A: would you consider yourself overweight or are you average or what 

230.25 237.92 B: uh a little over i'm afraid i got i got about another twenty pounds to go twenty five pounds to go to make the doctor happy [laughter] 

237.55 240.70 A: yeah i was going to say i need to lose about twenty but you know i've been 

239.49 242.51 B: yeah i'm i'm in that range you know where 

242.17 252.79 A: well what i've been doing is um just um pulling back on my uh seconds at dinner and watching you know my portion size and i've lost about fifteen pounds already so [noise] 

246.91 247.83 B: uh-huh 

249.31 250.40 B: yeah 

251.59 260.80 B: good good you know i i do pretty good at work you know i'm not much of a snacker at work or anything but you know at home and stuff i'm slacking off um 

261.23 265.05 B: she you know she doesn't have that much good stuff in the house you know [laughter] 

265.33 266.40 B: so it's it's 

266.43 272.16 B: i don't know where i'm gaining i guess i'm eating too big a dinner you know and then not not getting enough exercise 

272.40 281.49 B: we got a couple of dogs and we walk them a little bit but i don't know if that's really helping that much you know every every little bit helps you now 

279.52 284.72 A: [noise] [noise] i think yeah any any any little any walk you can do is going to help [sigh] 

281.62 282.67 B: but 

283.49 289.83 B: right but it's you know when you get home late like you do and you eat and you don't feel like doing anything 

289.84 296.29 B: really since i'm getting up at four four thirty in the morning i'm ready to uh start falling asleep at nine nine thirty ten you know 

295.82 299.03 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well you do you uh eat a good breakfast every morning or 

298.18 302.30 B: [laughter] not really usually like a bagel and a cup of coffee [laughter] 

301.68 315.59 A: yeah i think that's probably got something to do with it but then again i'm not sure not not an expert [sigh] yeah uh uh [noise] now that the weather's starting to turn i like to get out and jog a little so i might be able to do that now in the winter it's really tough 

305.35 307.52 B: yeah yeah mm 

312.20 314.20 B: yeah yeah i'm a big 

315.03 321.34 B: yeah i'm a big car nut and i've been outside buffing all these cars up and getting them ready for the summer and stuff [laughter] so 

322.02 328.63 A: yeah well got to somehow work uh fitness into that uh into your hobby and you'd be all set 

322.16 324.59 B: that's that's kinda my hobby is

330.06 332.58 A: do you have friends that work out all the time or 

332.36 342.92 B: uh not too many really there's a couple of guys that are that like you said have uh a club at work and they're hitting it pretty hard but uh no most of my friends you know 

342.95 347.18 B: their their exercise is maybe bowling or something [laughter] 

346.25 358.11 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah yeah i got some friends that run marathons and others that don't even do any physical activity so i got a you know it's not like i'm hanging out with the wrong group because i do have some that do workout

357.50 358.47 B: uh-huh 

358.62 360.84 A: but uh you never know 

360.59 362.21 B: yeah 

361.69 363.67 A: [sigh] well 

364.33 369.53 A: [sigh] and uh you know it's one of those things i i wish i could work out more it's something that i definitely want to do 

369.12 378.84 B: mhm well the thing that's kind of bugging me is uh or that was bugging me i it's a little better now that i'm working out but the one difference i see is in my blood pressure 

369.54 370.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

378.01 379.39 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

379.34 393.82 B: i'm like forty six years old and i'm still pretty much prescription free and i was getting to the point where i think if i wasn't doing some exercising and stuff my blood pressure would have gotten high enough that i would have had to start taking medicine 

393.45 395.21 A: (( [noise] now do you um i )) 

395.32 398.35 A: was going to say do you uh go to the doctor on a regular basis

399.09 400.35 A: (( okay uh-huh )) 

405.73 410.31 B: but i think if there's one benefit you know that i'd say for me that was 

410.52 413.94 B: keeping the blood pressure a little lower than than it was 

413.96 415.44 A: yeah yeah 

415.16 418.36 B: he was warning me you know [laughter] 

417.13 424.00 A: a lot of companies are now ki- giving you like uh one free doctor's office visit a year as an annual exam 

423.64 424.58 B: uh-huh 

424.03 426.62 A: and they kinda keep check of your health [noise] 

425.97 433.25 B: yeah we uh we're we're subject to like random drug testing and you kinda get like a mini physical when you do that every year 

432.81 433.67 A: uh-huh 

433.46 436.94 B: they kinda like you say keep their eye on you [laughter] 

437.19 444.89 A: and now we got something at work now uh it's a website you can go to and you answer questions it's called health check and it kind of uh 

441.04 441.75 B: (( mm )) 

443.20 444.07 B: uh-huh 

444.89 453.46 A: just you answer questions about your diet and your lifestyle and everything and it tells you if you're at risk for certain dis- you know diseases and things like that [noise] and it

453.63 464.45 A: kinda tell sends you like informative emails over the course of the year on are you doing this you should be doing this based on how you answered your survey that kind of stuff but [noise] 

456.92 457.90 B: uh-huh 

462.60 473.68 B: right heredity too you know everybody's got something in their family that uh is sort of prevalent whether it's cancer or heart you know or whatever everybody's got something 

472.96 474.06 A: [noise] sure 

474.28 477.57 A: yeah and that that's the other side of the coin it's like 

477.63 489.65 A: you kinda want to enjoy life while you're here on earth [laughter] and you don't want to be a a slave to to you know a workout regime or not eating uh enjoying what you eat every now and then so 

480.53 481.65 B: (( so yeah )) 

488.90 489.87 B: right 

489.45 497.57 A: you gotta find that balance i mean i true i truly believe that [sigh] workouts are part of that balance but 

490.84 491.85 B: yeah
