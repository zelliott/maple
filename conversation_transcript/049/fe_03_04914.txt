125.03 128.93 B: it didn't matter i told him i like po- i like chocolate chip and poppy seed 

128.37 129.67 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

128.96 131.88 B: and ah you know i told him 

131.24 135.18 A: right [noise] yeah she had to be retested 

135.40 140.75 A: [noise] two or three days later and they didn't of course they didn't find anything so [noise] she was okay but [noise] 

140.22 146.84 B: well i think i think you can drink [noise] you know water for a week [noise] ah something like that and ah or something and 

147.37 153.47 A: oh yeah so much water is supposed to dilute it where they won't find it or whatever [noise] 

147.40 148.68 B: (( it [noise] )) 

150.80 155.76 B: yep yeah it- it'll flush it out or something like that [noise] [noise] 

155.99 157.94 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

157.88 168.05 B: well the more responsible the job and and certainly the higher the pay i i i wonder is there a a a [noise] magical ah income level where you go from marijuana to cocaine 

168.58 169.65 A: [noise] [noise] ha 

169.76 171.00 A: i don't know 

172.63 176.27 A: [noise] i imagine i mean if you can afford more and [noise] 

176.62 189.19 A: marijuana i guess after [noise] any drug after a period of time doesn't affect you the same because you built up a resistance so [noise] you're looking you're looking for something that will [noise] affect you 

184.40 185.58 B: really 

189.87 195.83 B: oh i didn't know that so after you after you smoke marijuana for five years you don't get the same buzz as you used to 

195.37 202.27 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well all i know is um [noise] people that take medications you know for say allergies 

202.11 203.79 B: (( yeah )) 

202.68 212.69 A: build up a resistance after a certain period of time like [noise] i don't know a couple of years [noise] three or four years and then they have to switch [noise] to a different allergy medication [noise] 

212.92 214.18 B: (( mm [sigh] )) 

213.04 215.55 A: because it doesn't affect them the same [noise] 

214.87 221.11 B: yeah yeah i've i've heard that but i i didn't know that um well i mean i i who who who would've thought that ah 

221.95 229.73 B: you know a regular drug well not a regular drug it's a legal drug effective so i guess it i guess a drug's a drug so they affect you all the same way 

229.07 235.28 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah 'cause i've [noise] one of my ah former fo- former ah brother in laws [noise] 

235.32 242.19 A: is an alcoholic and [noise] he built up a resistance to so much alcohol you know per day 

242.06 243.70 B: yeah 

242.33 248.41 A: so he just has to drink so much more than the average person to start feeling it [noise] 

248.32 250.20 B: wow i didn't know that 

248.54 254.64 A: so i guess that's yeah that's the same with anything i guess you eventually build up a resistance and 

255.24 265.46 B: i i i didn't know that um i i saw a guy drink s- a six pack of beer one time and it struck me that you couldn't even drink six cans of water 

261.75 263.01 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

265.90 272.93 B: you know because it's just too much liquids and and i i was i was wondering how did he did do that you know he just he just drank it 

272.57 273.65 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

272.94 285.75 B: i guess drugs you know now wh- now why do you feel about if they test you for for marijuana and and cocaine why don't they test you for alcohol addic- addiction because if you're drunk you might as well be high 

283.42 284.43 A: (( [noise] )) 

285.93 294.74 A: [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] i i think with alcohol though you can kind of tell [noise] you don't have to test any body [noise] you can just smell it you know [noise] and you can see 'em 

286.55 287.68 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

293.48 294.89 B: well that's true but 

294.90 299.17 A: and you can see a person acting [noise] differently on alcohol 

298.90 302.70 B: yeah but why not treat it the same way why is alcohol accepted if 

302.95 317.87 B: if you're if you're performing surgery or or or driving a truck or flying a plane and you're drunk i mean you know wh- what you see that would be interesting what would happen if they made they they put alcohol in the same um uh 

317.93 321.64 B: no-no as as you know marijuana 

320.71 325.98 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] oh they do when they do the drug testing [noise] if alcohol is in your system you're in trouble too 

323.27 324.99 B: yeah 

326.90 336.60 A: because [noise] uh some um pilots were fired recently because they were drunk [noise] before they got on the plane and they test them mhm [noise] [noise] 

327.12 328.56 B: yeah but 

333.93 338.61 B: [noise] yeah i saw that yeah as a matter of fact that was that was in texas 

338.31 339.93 A: (( yup [noise] )) 

339.23 350.26 B: ah yeah but ah now ah i'm wondering do drugs i'm trying to remember do drugs when when you go in for a job do they say they don't ask you do you take drugs or do they do they ask you that 

340.35 341.95 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

348.99 353.22 A: [noise] [noise] well they ask you if you have any um 

354.07 356.73 A: [noise] [noise] any reaction to being tested you know 

356.71 359.27 B: (( [noise] yeah but )) 

356.95 363.88 A: [noise] and then if you say we- well i really don't [noise] don't care to be tested [noise] that of course [noise] that gives you away 

364.15 365.55 B: (( yeah it does )) 

365.23 367.22 A: [noise] [noise] yeah because th- [noise] 

366.27 373.19 B: and you ca- you you can say i'm trying to i don't want my civil rights violated right but they- they'd probably say bull crap you- you're a druggie 

372.94 374.32 A: right 

375.17 375.93 B: mm 

376.30 385.72 B: well i i think it's an employer's right to know the the type of employee that he's getting you know race ah race sex 

382.12 383.57 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

385.75 387.54 B: race color sex 

387.71 395.98 B: um forget that i mean now you know a human's a human but when it comes to putting something in your body that's not natural 

395.94 405.77 B: and it's gonna it's gonna affect your functioning y- yeah which held holds them out for liability they need they it's their perfect right to know that 

404.48 406.54 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

406.20 407.68 B: oh you agree with that huh 

407.28 408.87 A: [noise] i think so [sigh] 

408.83 409.92 B: oh okay 

409.73 412.82 A: [noise] especially if it's ah um [sigh] 

413.83 416.88 A: [noise] a type of employment that requires 

417.06 430.64 A: [noise] security or skill or something like that you know [noise] or some type of labor where [noise] if you are [noise] not yourself [noise] if you're on drugs then you won't be able to perform or you may get hurt [noise] 

420.41 422.09 B: right 

430.77 434.10 B: well that yeah you could get hurt too as well as somebody else 

431.40 432.71 A: (( [noise] you know )) 

433.51 435.11 A: (( [noise] right )) 

434.59 439.53 B: i think that bus drivers a bus driver who was um bringing a load of kids back 

439.93 441.23 B: from um 

441.40 443.33 B: from some church function 

443.46 445.69 B: in long i think it's in longview texas 

445.97 452.42 B: and ah he hit a pillar he drifted off the road and hit a pillar he got killed and a a couple of kids got killed 

451.33 452.66 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

452.67 458.12 B: and and later on they found out that he did have drugs in his system 

456.56 461.15 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah see so that's [noise] that's uncalled for [noise] 

460.91 461.95 B: (( true it is )) 

461.73 467.45 A: i think it's important that they know before [noise] that person's hired for that type of position [noise] [noise] 

467.21 474.83 B: yeah e- even for they won't guarantee they won't well i mean what ar- so what about random drug testing are you that or against that 

473.78 484.52 A: [noise] um i'm for it [noise] because you shouldn't know when it's coming you should just be honest [noise] i mean if you do drugs then don't take a job where they're gonna test you [noise] right 

483.34 484.96 B: well that's that's true 

484.65 486.83 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

485.45 486.77 B: that's very true 

487.05 489.94 B: as well as a cleric or a football player 

487.37 488.20 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

489.63 491.21 A: right 

492.43 496.77 B: yeah it seems like more money in this country the more money you got the more ah 

497.41 498.58 B: (( ah )) 

498.78 504.29 B: the cooler it is to do drugs or or the the more you're expected to do drugs 

502.97 505.34 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

504.32 513.43 B: i m- i mean ath- athletes are you know if if an athlete says well you know i do cocaine a little coke every once in a while everybody says well okay you know 

512.74 517.98 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah yeah but um [noise] the people that can't afford [noise] drugs 

518.11 520.75 A: (( drink [noise] you know )) 

519.97 522.11 B: well that's true that's true 

520.93 524.12 A: it it's whatever you can afford it's what you're gonna do 

524.99 530.21 B: yeah well like i said i they they should do some kind of alcohol testing also 

525.73 526.52 A: [noise] 

529.94 536.85 A: so [noise] [noise] yeah i think they include that [noise] with the drug testing [noise] 'cause alcohol's a drug you know 

534.54 536.28 B: (( yeah )) 

537.10 538.83 B: (( yeah )) 

537.21 539.93 A: [noise] [noise] but the thing with alcohol is you can 

540.58 543.54 A: [noise] it'll be out of your system [noise] in 

543.39 545.03 A: several hours so 

544.94 550.86 A: [noise] you could stop drinking [noise] long enough before [noise] you go and take the test and it's out of your system 

550.82 560.33 A: but [noise] [noise] but other drugs stay in your system longer like marijuana supposedly [noise] stays in your system for [noise] what at least a week [noise] 

550.97 552.76 B: yeah 

559.47 561.81 B: ah i think a couple weeks 

561.68 565.70 A: yeah so [noise] so you're taking a bigger chance there 

565.99 567.37 B: yeah well 

567.57 568.65 B: um 

571.95 574.46 B: how how many how many uh
