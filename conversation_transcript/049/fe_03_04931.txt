22.95 25.06 A: (( i'm married )) 

23.82 25.16 B: you're married 

25.19 30.54 B: so i guess it hasn't scared you uh scared you away then the the divorce rate 

27.44 30.29 A: (( yeah )) 

30.38 38.55 A: um well this is my second marriage actually yeah and well i'm very happy right now actually 

32.69 34.01 B: oh it is 

34.53 35.74 B: so that 

37.89 45.00 B: yeah did you was your f- did you the first time you got married were you uh like too young or you rush into it do you think or 

44.41 53.28 A: i think i was uh too young and naive about uh the whole concept of what a shared life is like but uh and now 

53.09 55.36 A: i really didn't think talking through with 

55.35 69.28 A: my uh with my first wife before i married her and i guess i was just too excited and got carried away and got married and uh it didn't work out but um this time round i think it's uh really good and i'm happy 

61.88 62.88 B: right 

64.82 65.84 B: yeah 

68.22 71.67 B: yeah and how long how long have you been together this time around 

70.95 76.88 A: um we've been together about three years and been married like uh two years and a few months now 

76.49 78.07 B: oh good 

77.19 80.30 A: (( yeah and you )) 

78.30 79.72 B: so that's exciting 

80.29 92.62 B: i'm single and i'm thirty uh i'm going to be thirty seven in july and i've never been married and [mn] i know so [laughter] everybody i know people who are always like what's wrong with you you know but i 

86.54 87.85 A: okay wow 

91.53 94.23 A: oh there's nothing wrong with you i think [laughter] 

93.47 99.40 B: but i think that um like the whole question was kind of interesting to me because um 

99.34 108.85 B: i don't you know so many people i think get married just for the sake of being married or um you know they don't want to be single anymore and so they kind of marry people that they don't necessarily 

108.89 111.76 B: will stay with for the rest of their lives you know or 

110.79 113.27 A: right 

111.93 119.63 B: so i just you know i'm going to wait i just keep waiting for that that perfect person or the somebody that i want to spend the rest of my life with and i just haven't met them yet so 

119.08 122.64 A: okay so you want to ma- get married when you're like absolutely sure 

121.89 132.53 B: sure yeah there's no i have not you know i've never dated someone that i've just felt that you know i've just never been that in love that i thought that i could you know spend the rest of my life with that person 

131.79 132.82 A: okay 

132.78 138.96 B: so i you know i just keep i'd like to i'm a kin- you know i feel like i'm ready to but i just haven't met the [laughter] person yet so 

138.03 143.87 A: right and that that's the most important thing too actually to find someone that you feel that way about 

139.46 140.15 B: mm 

140.60 143.63 B: yeah but i don't think i'm not scared because 

143.94 151.16 B: i'm not scared because of the divorce you know like when they asked if you're scared because of the divorce rate that doesn't scare me but i you know i think 

149.53 158.90 A: that doesn't scare me either because um to me it's that if you know right now if it's right for you you take a jump you take the risk whatever it is 

155.83 156.95 B: right 

158.28 159.12 B: right 

158.81 171.32 A: and however it pans out you deal with it you either work it out work it through and if it doesn't work i mean it's really sad but uh i mean it's not something that you should be scared of i mean that's how i feel about marriage 

165.06 166.09 B: yeah 

168.13 182.74 B: yeah i know i'm definitely not i don't yeah i just you know i think that i was still making a lot of changes in my life right up into my thirties so i think if i probably got married in my twenties i'd probably be divorced by now 'cause i've changed so much you know that i think 

175.95 176.96 A: okay 

182.71 185.76 B: that it's kind of good that i waited until i kind of know 

185.87 194.34 B: what i want to do and who i am before i go marry somebody and then start i think a lot of people get married so young and they're you know you don't you change so much in your twenties and 

194.47 199.64 B: and you know uh sometimes people just change in different directions and [mn] you know [mn] 

199.30 200.20 A: uh-huh 

199.89 206.35 B: but i think also i think the divorce rate has gone up so much because in you know it was so frowned upon in old days 

206.28 215.11 B: you know my parents got divorced and nobody in my school's parents were divorced it was like my parents were like the only ones i remember and now everybody's parents are you know i mean like 

214.30 216.49 A: right it's so common nowadays 

215.80 225.49 B: yeah yeah and i think i think a lot of times people didn't get divorced but it didn't mean that that marriage was any any better back then they just they just stuck it out a little bit longer 

224.09 238.49 A: i think that's that is indeed the case that uh uh previously like a lot of people stuck together um i mean if if they were unhappy in the marriage after being married they just because of like uh the expectations like social expectations 

236.16 237.11 B: right 

237.34 241.73 B: and what society thinks and what people will think of you if you get divorced 

238.76 245.42 A: and and now i think the difference is that uh if people realise they are unhappy they are more willing to move on 

243.37 244.14 B: yeah 

244.82 245.85 B: right 

246.25 249.56 B: it's true very true so yeah i think people now need to 

246.44 248.53 A: (( and so )) 

248.64 253.07 A: so what kind of um family values do you prefer i think that's the topic 

252.77 254.85 B: yeah the 

253.36 254.76 A: yeah i mean 

254.92 256.51 B: well i just um 

256.74 267.20 B: you know i i just i just believe in respect i think builds a good uh family values for family relationship for everyone is you respect someone as much as you you want to be respected and you respect yourself 

267.09 276.01 B: i just think it's really important that whether it be your children or your parents or your spouse that you have to um have as much respect for them 

271.25 273.96 A: (( right )) 

276.20 279.88 B: and if you do that then i think you can have a lot of love and a lot of friendship 

279.55 280.68 A: right 

279.99 281.58 B: that would uh 

281.84 292.18 B: you know because y- you see a lot of sometimes you you know you go out with couples and you see somebody if you can see it when they respect each other and you can see it when they don't and it just [mn] it's so it's so unhealthy to me when um 

284.92 285.96 A: (( right )) 

292.58 299.59 B: you know parents are screaming at their kids and don't listen to their kids or the kids are screaming at their parents and have no respect for their parents or 

299.61 302.62 B: you know husbands and wife are bickering all the time and 

300.67 304.00 A: (( that's )) 

302.73 305.10 B: i think so much of that has to do with uh 

305.19 308.76 B: you know just uh you know respect general respecting someone 

307.81 320.52 A: yeah you should respect someone and i mean if you're with someone for a long enough time you get to an understanding where you know like uh what the other person needs and i mean you also like have to meet [mn] each other's need in a relationship you know 

320.23 321.67 B: uh you have to be what's that 

321.30 329.08 A: you have to meet each other's needs as well yeah and just make sure that one person is not being completely ignored 

322.72 324.83 B: needs right like a compromise or 

325.60 326.52 B: yeah 

328.91 330.13 B: yeah 

329.09 334.13 A: and o- one person doesn't take like overwhelming importance over the other one 

333.79 334.76 B: right 

334.91 339.45 A: that's i mean i think that just goes back to the same thing you said respect 

338.66 339.74 B: yeah 

339.85 345.21 B: well like so how do you deal with it like if you guys are having a rough time how do you do you guys uh you have a good communication 

345.07 353.80 A: um generally we do i mean i mean we work things out sometimes they get so bad that uh we annoy each a lot and 

347.76 348.62 B: mhm 

353.17 353.97 B: uh-huh 

353.71 361.52 A: uh i guess uh if it goes really bad what ends up happening is uh we start missing each other and feeling bad about like uh fighting 

360.69 361.95 B: yeah 

361.45 376.30 A: and then we just kind of make up and and during that process we address what the cause was and then we just uh talk about that and decide that okay this is what the problem was this is what the uh solution is and if there's no solution we just accept that there is no solution and we're just not going to fight about it though 

363.61 364.74 B: yeah 

375.67 378.54 B: yeah you just agree to disagree then [laughter] [mn] 

377.20 382.66 A: yeah and um that's how it works out but um we don't really fight much either 

382.18 396.29 B: yeah it just it just feels awful i'm one of those people who i just i never fought with my boyfriends i don't really fight with my friends you know i just i'm not i don't like i'm non confrontational so i don't like i hate that feeling i get a pit in my stomach when i feel like uh 

396.24 404.46 B: you know someone's mad at me or i've offended somebody so i try to avoid that you know as much as i can or um 

404.53 407.98 B: you know somebody's mad i really try and take and look and see what maybe i've done 

408.22 410.22 B: you know that upset them or 

409.68 411.46 A: (( right )) 

410.51 415.71 B: you know but it's it's hard so i'm not one of those people who like you know some people i think enjoy the bickering 

412.27 413.80 A: (( some )) 

416.01 417.23 B: you know they 

417.24 419.63 B: some people get some kind of excitement out of it 

418.43 419.29 A: (( people are )) 

419.13 419.51 A: (( [mn] )) 

419.37 430.72 A: uh uh i mean i think that's their attitude like their style like their just to like to resolve everything through a confrontation and fighting and things but no this is what i really want so for me it's just like 

426.68 427.45 B: (( [mn] )) 

428.89 429.74 B: right 

430.69 435.31 A: uh through building a consensus about something 

433.39 434.22 B: right 

435.41 441.06 B: uh no i think that i think some people think that that's that's passionate to be screaming all the [laughter] time or something but 

440.86 448.65 A: yeah that's true and not really pa- i think it's counter productive so at least it would like uh more stress and anxiety and worse 

442.85 443.55 B: yeah 

444.00 444.92 B: yeah 

447.00 449.46 B: yeah and do you have do you have any children 

449.31 451.18 A: no we don't 

450.50 451.28 B: no 

452.34 455.48 B: i was just going to ask you how they you don't have any from your first marriage either 

455.16 458.22 A: no my first marriage didn't even last long 

455.88 456.67 B: (( no )) 

458.12 458.98 B: no 

458.31 459.82 A: (( [mn] )) 

459.09 462.33 B: i know a lot of people like that got married young and it was kind of quick 

462.49 465.92 B: so what other like what other values do you look for 

465.49 466.73 A: (( do you have children )) 

466.82 468.73 B: no no no children 

468.77 470.20 A: (( though oh )) 

469.26 475.02 B: so i'm not i don't i i just i have nieces and nephews and they're kind of like my kids you know because 

474.20 475.18 A: okay 

474.82 484.58 B: uh now my biological click you know tock uh clock is ticking but i um i don't right necessarily want to have kids but i am very close to my nieces and nephews so 

484.10 485.34 A: so that's great 

485.04 491.39 B: yeah so i mean i enjoy children but i don't i'm not one of those people who has you know feels the need to rush to get married to have kids so 

490.90 503.37 A: yeah well i guess like my biggest value in life is to be happy and i just apply that to everything like to friends my family my parents my siblings uh my wife 

491.72 492.81 B: (( um you )) 

495.69 496.92 B: (( know right )) 

498.25 499.18 B: right 

503.71 512.79 A: um whoever i'm with i mean i just want everybody to be happy so i guess uh i just act in a way which doesn't cause like uh too much grief you know 

508.01 509.26 B: right 

512.80 513.99 B: (( yeah i agree )) 

512.85 520.29 A: and i think a lot of people actually do in general but sometimes you come across certain people that are just too much you know 

520.15 522.28 B: yeah yes i do know 

520.86 521.93 A: (( and uh ))
