0.64 2.00 B: hi 

1.85 3.00 A: (( hi hi )) 

2.06 3.18 B: i'm dan 

3.75 6.12 A: i'm i'm marcus how are you 

5.58 9.46 B: not too bad i'm up in canada saskatchewan wha- what about you 

9.28 11.80 A: uh i'm down in texas 

11.37 19.04 B: uh a little ways apart [laughter] a little north of you [laughter] [laughter] yeah so um 

12.75 17.16 A: yeah [laughter] yeah just a [laughter] bit 

19.75 22.53 B: what do you think of the topic what's your 

20.01 31.51 A: [laughter] um mm it was it was public um do public or private schools have the right to forbid students to read certain books did i hear that correctly is that what 

30.13 36.01 B: i think that's what they said uh whether they you could forbid them or not um 

36.12 37.43 A: um 

37.76 45.44 A: you you can you can forbid them in in schools if you want to but they'll still have the ability to read the book 

38.25 39.18 B: [noise] 

43.97 44.83 B: (( [cough] )) 

45.73 47.95 B: yeah we can't be with them 

45.92 48.31 A: you know if they want to right 

48.08 53.87 B: can't be with them twenty four hours a day [laughter] so but the uh i think the schools uh 

49.89 53.27 A: right so i i mean [laughter] 

54.49 58.09 B: definitely have some right in that regard at school 

58.24 61.76 B: and uh not allow them maybe to bring them [mn] 

61.62 63.83 A: right 

62.45 72.48 B: i guess i could think of something say in the area of a catholic school board like i don't know in the states we have catholic school boards and and public school boards here 

72.51 73.42 A: (( okay )) 

72.64 77.20 B: and uh you know sometimes the catholic school will get a book that is 

77.33 78.60 B: totally 

78.65 80.92 B: you know contrary to their religion 

81.02 82.62 A: (( mm right )) 

81.18 84.98 B: and uh ban it and i don't see a problem with that 

84.53 88.15 A: mm right i yeah i don't you know i you know i'm 

88.24 97.08 A: i'm not one for censorship i never really have had any prob- problem with private schools or you know parochial schools or you know 

93.04 94.06 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

95.98 96.75 B: yeah 

96.81 97.59 B: (( [noise] )) 

97.15 108.26 A: uh censoring books because well i mean they you know it's their school they can do what they what you know it's their education they're supposed to be teaching you certain things you know catholic schools 

105.64 106.32 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

107.83 109.04 B: mhm 

108.44 118.14 A: teach a um you know teach a you know a religious or catholic curriculum and if it the book doesn't fit within that then of course they have the right to you know 

117.92 126.38 B: right yeah they should have i mean [mn] there there perhaps uh has to be some um maybe a recourse of some kind to 

118.53 120.93 A: to right 

126.84 138.02 B: um accept or you know reject the censorship part of it because you could have somebody who like say a principal in a school who's very um 

138.55 143.32 B: anti something and he could declare we're not having this book period 

142.35 146.57 A: (( right )) 

143.39 149.50 B: uh and yet everybody else feels it's fine so i think there would have to be some kind of a um 

150.57 161.64 B: a board not a boa- not a paid [laughter] board or something not too much bureaucracy but something where a person could say you know the teacher could go back and say uh you know i think my the kids should learn this subject 

153.04 155.04 A: right [laughter] 

161.69 169.32 B: and um i think that's where it's more would be involved more than parents it would be the teachers who wanted to teach something 

167.53 168.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

170.62 173.59 B: [cough] and if they submitted it to this uh 

171.15 174.47 A: (( right )) 

174.21 183.29 B: two or three people that could say yes or no and uh it might work but to have one person be able to say no 

183.62 184.85 A: right 

183.71 186.26 B: uh [mn] i'm not sure that's right [laughter] 

185.97 193.30 A: yeah well yeah i i there's there's certainly some problems with that but of course you know the board would be 

193.32 199.30 A: well then again the board would be different and you know in different areas but then again so would the um you 

195.82 196.98 B: mhm 

199.88 204.45 A: know so would the people who put them on the board you know a book that might be 

200.92 202.02 B: mhm 

202.31 203.52 B: (( [noise] yeah i )) 

204.53 210.58 A: banned in um you know in one place you know would be perfectly you know fine in another 

210.32 211.66 B: yeah yeah 

210.73 211.85 A: (( you know )) 

211.85 218.17 B: and yeah i know we have had problems you know at at times in schools up here in canada where 

218.19 225.21 B: a principal decides you know the head- headmaster of the school says we're not having that book 

225.56 226.91 B: and uh 

227.18 233.94 B: you know it's been their declaration it isn't even a sch- a a school board wide uh decision 

234.11 238.51 B: it was a principal that made that decision and and i think that's wrong 

234.69 237.68 A: (( right )) 

238.58 241.71 A: mm yeah definitely 

239.29 239.95 B: (( you know )) 

240.38 242.34 B: when you got you know maybe 

242.48 249.93 B: fifty schools in a school board or a hundred schools in a school board and one can't read that book and the other [laughter] ninety nine are it 

249.45 251.26 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

249.95 251.62 B: that doesn't make a lot of sense 

251.60 252.90 A: no no 

251.76 254.18 B: but censorship can go too far 

253.88 256.10 A: (( that's true that's true )) 

256.84 257.93 B: (( [mn] [mn] [cough] 'scuse me )) 

257.12 269.94 A: 'cause i was i actually was at a um i went to a private school and while i was there um i don't know if you're familiar with um the book um the color purple by alice walker okay 

268.09 268.97 B: yeah 

269.54 270.64 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

270.12 273.81 A: well while i was there or at you know at least 

273.84 280.97 A: when it was you know actually i guess when i was there because it was my senior year at high school um we could read the book 

278.58 280.15 B: (( mm )) 

281.06 282.00 B: mhm 

281.45 294.08 A: no it was my junior year i'm sorry but we could read it and i believe it was the year after that um it was banned for some reason you know i guess i don't you know it was well yeah no one could read it 

293.86 294.61 B: yeah 

294.05 303.54 A: i don't know why the only thing i can think of that was really you know remotely controversial about it was you know the one you know the one character you know 

304.23 309.18 A: um in the one lesbian character now i don't you know but 

306.55 307.39 B: yeah 

308.41 316.39 B: well now when you look back now it's things that they're censoring thing or were censoring things that are almost commonplace now 

309.57 310.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

316.14 318.30 A: right 

317.12 326.05 B: [cough] like swearing um you know you go back twenty five thirty years and if a book had any cuss words in it it was censored 

319.51 320.07 A: (( [mn] )) 

326.28 327.98 B: in some school areas 

326.74 329.95 A: (( right )) 

328.03 331.37 B: um i mean a stupid one like peyton place 

331.40 337.73 B: you know at one [laughter] time was right out and i mean it really wasn't [noise] that nowadays it isn't that significant 

331.79 333.39 A: right 

337.24 338.41 A: right 

338.22 345.32 B: [cough] so we have to be the censorship has to be a little bit flexible for the for society's 

345.70 346.79 B: movements 

346.39 347.21 A: (( true )) 

347.08 350.50 B: and um if society's becoming more tolerant then 

351.25 357.18 B: you know maybe even i mean if you don't cen- if you censor it they're just going to go out and get it from the library and 

356.62 358.07 A: right 

357.20 358.60 B: read it [laughter] anyway 

358.15 368.65 A: right because mainly because it's censored like why is it censored why don't they want [mn] want me to read this [mn] you know it's like okay they don't me to read this yeah you know 

359.56 360.12 B: (( [mn] )) 

361.96 363.01 B: mhm 

364.95 365.74 B: yeah 

368.43 378.20 B: yeah there's got to be something in there i want to read [laughter] yeah yeah you're actually dr- uh a lot of times censorship uh sells more of the product 

368.97 371.85 A: yeah right exactly 

378.02 379.10 A: right 

378.69 382.97 B: you know people will run out and buy it because they want to know what's in there 

382.84 384.16 A: (( right i )) 

383.31 384.47 B: (( and uh )) 

384.60 386.02 B: [cough] you know so 

386.08 389.11 B: i i do have i have a problem with censorship but 

389.34 391.67 B: on the other hand uh 

391.73 399.84 B: you know there if if it if it is absolutely contrary to the to a group's thinking then maybe it's necessary as we said earlier 

398.27 400.78 A: (( think i [mn] i can see that yeah that's )) 

400.27 400.83 B: (( yeah )) 

400.86 402.04 B: (( and uh [mn] )) 

402.21 404.74 A: that's pretty much how i feel too [laughter] 

403.81 411.05 B: yeah so what do you do you have what public and parochial and or any other groups or just that 

409.90 411.94 A: um let's see 

411.89 416.74 A: um here in um here in texas um 

416.59 431.57 A: it's they're public they're they're private they're parochial and there are some that are sort of inbetween public and private i mean it's it's a private school that functions a lot like a public school 

431.50 437.23 A: or you you know it's i guess it's a public school owned by a private company 

436.48 438.00 B: (( [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] [cough] yeah )) 

437.70 443.97 A: so there you know there are a number of different um options for yeah for education 

440.46 441.60 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

443.35 446.88 B: yeah cause those private ones i think have a little more 

447.08 448.08 B: um 

448.28 451.07 B: control over their censorship 

451.14 465.15 B: if it's owned by so- like if you own something uh you own the [noise] school uh you would have the right to to dictate what was going to be taught and if your employees wouldn't follow that uh they could be let go 

453.53 456.75 A: (( right )) 

458.62 460.17 A: right 

465.10 466.44 A: right 

465.51 472.93 B: but the public and the parochial that are funded by the public in at large i think there's a little 

473.07 475.54 B: little different approach has to be taken for 

475.42 477.17 A: right 

475.74 476.97 B: censoring 

477.35 479.75 B: [lipsmack] but private schools i mean how can you 

480.53 484.34 B: you know if i own something how can somebody tell me what i have to [laughter] teach 

484.18 485.65 A: exactly 

484.95 485.92 B: (( [cough] you )) 

486.13 491.62 B: know uh except except at the end when you are trying to apply into university or something 

486.39 488.13 A: although although 

491.17 493.95 A: that's right right 

492.50 494.17 B: there has to be basic 

494.39 495.29 B: learning 

496.37 497.23 B: (( and uh )) 

498.07 502.09 B: so but i i don't know i don't know what other direction they can go 

502.40 504.16 A: yeah [laughter] 

503.52 509.08 B: [laughter] yeah is this an issue that's coming up a lot down there or do you know or like in the states 

507.37 514.01 A: uh um i haven't heard i mean i haven't heard a lot about it i mean 

513.02 513.91 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

514.03 518.37 A: it hasn't you know it really it really hasn't been a big news 

518.20 530.32 A: you know topic i haven't seen anything on it but it but it always seems to come up every once in a while there's always something every you know four five years or something at some you know 

520.44 521.24 B: mhm 

528.75 529.87 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

530.48 534.76 B: i just wondered why this topic happened to come up [laughter] i wondered i thought maybe it was a 

532.85 535.25 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

534.82 537.31 B: an issue right now or something [laughter] [mn] 

536.60 542.46 A: yeah yeah that's true 'cause i mean you know some of the other ones have been you know pretty pertinent and then you know 

538.12 539.03 B: (( [cough] you know )) 

541.39 542.62 B: mhm 

542.55 545.80 A: (( other you know like this one here is kind of um ))

547.92 549.04 B: yeah 

549.06 549.82 B: yeah 

550.54 551.28 B: (( [mn] )) 

551.31 556.22 B: and sometimes it's hard to talk for ten minutes [laughter] on on the subject [mn] 

553.37 555.58 A: that that yeah that's true 

555.70 562.85 A: that is true i i had one that i was i had to um determine whether or not i wanted to um 

556.62 557.78 B: (( yeah so mm [noise] )) 

563.02 570.49 A: like take a million dollars from a quote unquote benefactor that um would offer me the money if i

579.73 588.01 A: yeah yeah that was very hard to talk i i don't think even we even got to five minutes on that one but yeah 

582.65 583.58 B: mhm 

584.40 586.49 B: (( mm yeah )) 

586.64 593.31 B: what what do you think uh the other thing too is how do you think that they should control the censorship say as it pertains to 

593.33 595.44 B: the libraries in the schools 

596.12 597.33 A: um 

596.74 599.89 B: [cough] like should they have open book like have any book at all
