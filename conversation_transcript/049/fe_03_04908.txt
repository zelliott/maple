0.52 3.67 A: hi there i'm mark fletcher mark 

3.51 5.12 B: hi i'm debbie 

5.13 6.12 A: (( how's it going )) 

5.98 7.11 B: good how are you 

7.22 8.47 A: very good thank you 

8.75 11.35 A: that was quick they don't normally find somebody that quick 

11.01 12.06 B: yes 

13.08 15.25 A: okay drug testing i guess 

14.93 15.86 B: yes 

15.43 21.61 A: i guess companies drug testing i guess i'd that seems pretty nasty to me [laughter] 

20.91 22.76 B: that i'm sorry it what 

22.08 22.84 A: my 

23.15 29.25 A: it it seems it seems very invasive to me being that's my gut reaction that it's 

26.43 27.29 B: uh-huh 

29.95 34.00 A: (( it's none of their business i mean particularly for )) 

34.61 39.12 A: i guess drugs i would consider not particularly dangerous like marijuana 

40.74 42.06 B: yeah 

41.50 43.77 A: i don't know about other things i mean 

44.12 48.61 B: i guess some of them you know depends on how heavy somebody would be into them 

44.12 44.97 A: (( i don't know )) 

48.46 51.03 A: yeah that's true yeah yeah 

49.09 49.93 B: you know you 

50.42 60.53 B: so i guess it you know 'cause it's something depends on i guess if it's drugs that you know you should have for something but if you know some of the people that's really heavily into drugs it's a good idea for them 

58.73 59.89 A: yeah 

60.94 64.65 B: because you wouldn't want them in a place of work and be around them 

64.60 68.54 A: oh that's true yes yeah i mean i guess it's always difficult 

68.94 76.22 A: i guess i'm i'm imagining it's possible to safely use drugs occasionally but that's probably not not true very often 

74.76 83.00 B: you don't realize there is some people out there that how much abuse there could be and then if if they're in like factories and then they could be dangerous or 

78.28 80.30 A: (( oh no yeah that's right )) 

82.39 86.94 A: oh that's that's not good at all yeah yeah yeah 

84.16 85.24 B: yes 

85.77 93.83 B: and as a matter of fact i was just reading uh an article in a magazine about um it was like something with uh um that 

94.26 97.65 B: how you don't realize how habit forming that can be 

97.51 99.18 A: uh-huh yeah 

97.95 111.66 B: and it was actually you know it was a big thing it was talking even women was real big abusers with that that you just started off thinking it's just gonna give you a little boost of energy and you realize after a period of time you come to depend on it 

102.32 103.46 A: mhm 

104.88 105.78 A: (( oh no )) 

108.11 108.98 A: uh-huh 

111.17 112.07 A: (( oh no )) 

112.18 117.28 A: yeah yeah i think you've persuaded me maybe it's a better idea than i thought at first 

116.89 121.94 B: yeah i guess you don't stop and think how many bad ones there could be out there 

121.48 122.82 A: (( yeah i think so )) 

122.84 126.94 B: you know some people like you said you might take it and you know it could be something that 

123.24 124.41 A: yeah 

127.11 133.64 B: you need or something but there's so many out there that's bad that they kind of ruin it for the ones that 

128.92 129.79 A: yeah 

132.92 137.31 A: yeah i think that's yeah that's a good point i guess may maybe the 

137.52 140.39 A: part of the problem is for me that i i 

140.64 148.95 A: it depends what the companies do when they find out i guess i mean if if they if they just fire you straight off that seems like of unreasonable if they 

144.11 145.03 B: yeah 

148.84 156.67 A: i don't know if they try and find out how bad a problem it is for you and give you a chance to take treatment and so on that seems more reasonable 

156.29 163.14 B: uh-huh and then you even hear that if what is it i think it's something like it's the poppy seed 

163.16 164.07 A: uh-huh 

163.28 166.74 B: that sometimes if you eat like those muffins or something like that 

165.88 167.63 A: (( i know yeah yeah )) 

166.70 179.28 B: that that shows up now that yeah that's something like you wouldn't ever stop and think if you eat something like that then you have to go for a drug test you're not actually doing anything and here it could show up you're a bad person 

168.88 171.06 A: really [laughter] 

172.79 173.73 A: yeah 

174.12 175.69 A: [laughter] 

178.98 180.28 A: (( no i'm not )) 

179.66 192.23 B: yes so yeah i understand what you're saying with that if they would confront you and then you have a chance say i never done this stuff but it just happened to be something yeah something you eat yeah 'cause something like that could make you look could make anybody look like a bad person 

184.54 187.12 A: [laughter] yeah they have to be casual yeah 

188.23 189.05 A: yeah 

190.87 193.55 A: it could be terrible couldn't it yeah 

192.50 193.57 B: yes 

193.62 204.96 B: so yeah i see what you're saying it depends on how they handle it if somebody would contact you or you know if they're not even fair and just say well if you don't get it because it showed this and you didn't even have a chance to 

196.66 197.44 A: yeah 

202.21 203.30 A: yeah 

203.36 205.01 A: yeah 

205.32 209.09 B: or like something like that if you could go back and be retested later 

209.08 212.39 A: yeah yeah yeah i never 

210.95 214.13 B: because then it would you would know something like that 

213.89 220.84 A: mhm i never heard about the poppy seed thing [laughter] that's oh no that's amazing 

217.87 219.20 B: oh you haven't 

220.37 229.07 B: yeah it is i've heard that that there's something in in those seeds that will show up that it's like a drug 

222.59 223.49 A: uh-huh 

225.26 226.20 A: yeah 

227.85 228.66 A: yeah 

228.97 238.51 A: yeah i think i know poppies they used to use for what for anesthetics i think somehow it's related to heroin and those drugs i think uh-huh 

237.35 245.03 B: that i'm not sure i never heard anything i just have heard people say that if you know you ever know you're going for that don't make sure you don't eat nothing with that in it 

240.82 242.59 A: yeah 

244.80 246.31 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

245.42 246.72 B: 'cause that could 

246.62 248.51 A: (( yeah )) 

249.04 250.90 A: (( i've never had any drug test )) 

251.03 260.32 B: i have had one and it was because after i had if i'd been with the company for a long time and they didn't do them when i first started but i had gotten hurt on the job 

253.20 254.98 A: (( mhm )) 

258.29 259.26 A: (( oh i see )) 

260.42 261.25 A: (( oh no )) 

260.95 272.08 B: and i had to go for one after that because they had to prove that you wasn't on any kind of drugs and it was interesting for me because i had been hurt like a month before 

264.18 266.53 A: oh i see yeah 

267.71 269.36 A: (( right )) 

271.90 273.10 A: (( really )) 

271.98 279.49 B: and i didn't pursue it at first they didn't think anything was going to go wrong and then it's like something's wrong and i said i'll still go through it because i know i don't do nothing 

276.79 277.54 A: (( right )) 

279.36 281.13 A: yeah yeah 

280.51 283.11 B: so i said i have no problem doing it so 

282.49 283.38 A: uh-huh 

283.42 286.95 B: you know if somebody that does then they might have had more of an issue but i said 

286.36 287.46 A: yeah i see 

287.09 291.20 B: never done that so i wasn't do whatever you need to do 

288.69 289.85 A: yeah 

291.16 296.67 A: yeah yeah i guess that was all to do with insurance claims i guess that's that's 

296.11 298.65 B: yeah they have to probably be careful and 

296.85 298.18 A: (( what brought that on )) 

298.38 299.26 A: yeah 

298.67 301.80 B: they have to make sure that nothing's wrong with anything so 

301.39 303.83 A: yeah yeah 

302.01 309.01 B: they do those but yeah i think it years ago they didn't do as much with the drug testing but with so many people doing stuff nowadays i think that's 

309.34 311.33 B: more and more they do those 

311.18 312.50 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

311.47 314.34 B: and it's i'm sure it's just to protect themselves and 

313.98 315.29 A: mhm 

314.58 316.34 B: protect other employees 

316.13 325.17 A: yeah yeah that's true on on on the other hand it's probably a good opportunity for people to get help and it may be a good thing for a lot of people 

322.38 323.48 B: yes 

325.07 331.69 B: yeah because that could let somebody know hey there's a problem i need to take care of this if i want jobs because 

328.56 329.56 A: yeah 

329.88 330.63 A: (( that's )) 

331.04 332.34 A: yeah 

331.71 337.05 B: you're not gonna get a job if you come up and show for drugs a person won't get hired 

335.17 338.07 A: (( yeah that's right yeah )) 

337.23 340.44 B: so maybe for some people that would be a good thing 

338.59 341.52 A: yeah yeah maybe a good thing yeah 

340.82 341.77 B: yeah 

341.79 347.23 B: hopefully some i'm sure some it'd work some may not but if they're really into having a problem then 

344.72 345.59 A: yeah 

346.79 347.91 A: mhm 

347.28 350.54 B: they'll just go on to the next place and try again 

350.37 359.38 A: (( yeah yeah i've never worked for a company that did i mean i i work for a very small company at the moment i can't imagine they would do that kind of thing )) 

360.94 364.24 A: (( and before that i always i always worked for universities )) 

364.71 368.16 A: so that's i don't think they go into that for that kind of thing 

367.66 375.47 B: yeah they yeah i'm not sure about that like i said i've not had to deal with that i'm going to be looking for a job soon so i'm sure i'm going to be going through this drug testing so 

372.18 373.47 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

374.22 375.71 A: oh really uh-huh 

375.79 381.29 B: i'll be having to deal with that and like i said never having done nothing they can do whatever they need to do 

377.49 378.42 A: yeah 

379.42 383.92 A: mhm yeah [laughter] yeah that's good yeah 

382.58 386.60 B: yeah it's a good thing with people that don't they ones that do they're the ones 

386.14 390.72 A: that's true so you think they'll give you a drug test before they even hire you 

391.07 396.72 B: i would think places would i think they i think i'm believing that's how they do it i'm gonna be learning that 

392.94 393.79 A: uh-huh 

396.43 399.34 A: (( right uh-huh yeah i'd be interested to know that as well )) 

397.72 403.74 B: we're just starting job hunting i'm gonna be going through so i'll be having to deal with that and having that done 

399.82 400.81 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

405.14 409.11 A: (( yeah that'd be interesting to know that you know how long this )) 

409.13 414.29 A: it lasts like if you take a drug one year then it might show up several years later 

414.50 417.60 A: (( i really don't know about that how long the signs might last no )) 

417.18 425.37 B: you know what i've never even thought about anything like that yeah that if something yeah if you did something how long anything yeah i don't even know that 

420.73 421.81 A: yeah 

425.18 426.03 A: uh-huh 

425.60 427.27 B: 'cause that's something i've never 

427.60 432.38 B: had any dealing with and never had like i said this is gonna be new for drug testing 

432.14 433.69 A: (( yeah mm )) 

432.61 434.83 B: but yeah i've never heard anybody say that 

434.85 437.09 B: i'm sure some things stay a while 

435.11 436.01 A: (( i don't know )) 

436.91 443.09 A: (( yeah i bet yeah i mean that's like i said just everything they have to take into account be kind of like it's )) 

443.04 452.94 A: kinda like built in smoking marijuana when he was in college it's kind of unfair for to lose a good person from a job because of a reason like that so like from twenty years ago 

451.77 456.05 B: yeah that yeah you're right i i had never thought about anything like that 

455.63 458.24 A: (( yeah i i've no idea how long it lasts yeah )) 

457.69 462.40 B: yeah but i had never even thought about you know some people that could be 

463.17 467.44 B: that could be something like you said that could show up you know just like i said with the poppy seed thing 

467.30 468.22 A: yeah 

467.48 473.91 B: or something like that if you got something in your system and it could stay awhile i've never thought about that but that's an interesting point 

471.02 471.93 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

474.05 484.17 A: yeah i guess it it all comes back to the fact that they have to get figure out all the facts like before making a decision like find out what drugs you took and for how long and all this 

484.08 485.04 B: uh-huh 

484.33 488.86 A: and if and if it's handled properly i don't have see any problems with it 

488.29 489.33 B: yeah 

489.91 493.66 B: yeah i would hope people would do that but i don't know how 

493.01 496.04 A: who knows yeah yeah 

494.07 496.87 B: yeah who knows [laughter] how anybody does that 

496.06 506.05 A: yeah and it might be a problem with in the it's it's one of those kinds of things like if you get accused of it it's very hard for to ever get over it 

505.38 506.28 B: uh-huh 

506.24 512.54 A: right it's like if if everybody at work finds out it might kind of hang over your career even though you were cleared 

512.25 513.16 B: uh-huh 

512.87 519.98 A: i mean if you got like a false test or something from ten years ago or something it could work out to be very unfair 

519.64 521.83 B: that yes it that would be 

520.70 521.54 A: (( yeah )) 

521.68 527.65 A: (( yeah i guess if they handle it privately that would be good that would be a good thing )) 

527.05 528.89 B: yeah you would hope they do 

528.71 530.32 A: yeah yeah 

529.17 531.93 B: that that it's handled in the right way yes 

531.42 533.32 A: mhm 

532.15 534.60 B: that's it's good points to think about 

534.62 535.32 A: (( mm )) 

535.15 539.20 B: and with having to deal with going through and people with drug tests 

539.09 540.99 A: yeah 

541.37 544.68 A: i guess if they take them before they hire you that's pretty good because 

544.76 550.92 A: then if your colleagues are are likely to know about it or at least it'll be dealt with before you even started work 

547.75 548.68 B: yeah 

550.61 555.13 B: would know yeah yeah and i believe everything is done that's something they do before 

554.88 556.19 A: that's pretty good 

555.60 556.88 B: so yeah you don't 

556.29 557.50 A: (( yeah that helps )) 

557.21 568.80 B: yeah because you don't want to get started into a job and then have something happen so i think they i believe they do all that stuff before they would even think about hiring you you have to be passed the drug test have to pass it 

563.83 564.75 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

568.27 569.55 A: mhm 

568.81 574.20 B: and i think it takes a i'm not sure if it i don't think the results are right away i think it takes a little bit of time 

572.97 573.80 A: yeah 

573.90 574.84 A: yeah 

574.96 577.36 B: before they get the results and 

577.46 580.18 B: then they hire you as long as everything shows up 

579.36 581.21 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

580.58 582.35 B: good 

581.56 596.36 A: yeah oh i don't know i i never knew anybody who had to take one which is kind of interesting i just yeah my sister works for the security services like the c._i._a. in england and and i don't think she's ever had to take one even which is surprising 

586.90 588.22 B: oh really 

591.46 592.39 B: uh-huh 

595.76 599.45 B: yeah i was going to say for something like that you would think they would have had to 

598.08 599.89 A: you'd think they'd be really strict
