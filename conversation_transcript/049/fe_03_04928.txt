56.53 57.59 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

59.78 71.45 A: [noise] yeah it's probably more when you're when you're a lot younger [noise] when you're a teenager you really don't i guess i didn't wanna be around my parents a whole lot you know i wanted to go out with my friends and do things [mn] 

59.91 61.76 B: to be there for you yeah [noise] 

71.50 72.67 B: yeah 

71.56 73.99 A: so [sigh] i really ah i 

74.18 84.19 A: guess it wouldn't have bothered me as much you know if it had happened if if they had been [sigh] you know if i had been in my teens than if i had been like you know five or six or something 

83.64 84.62 B: (( yeah i )) 

84.21 88.37 A: [cough] 'cause you can't understand it as much whenever you're when y- you're younger [sigh] 

88.38 88.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

88.81 90.93 B: i i don't i don't mind it now 

91.06 95.57 B: [noise] but ah you know i when i was stuck at home or whatever waiting for my dad to come home 'cause i was 

91.10 92.34 A: (( [sigh] yeah [noise] )) 

95.62 98.15 B: [noise] i was living with my dad instead of my mom 

98.47 104.25 B: you know it it's it was it'd like kill it killed my social life for a little bit and 

103.69 106.67 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah yeah it had to be pretty hard 

104.73 105.45 B: it's 

106.29 107.80 B: (( yeah but )) 

106.93 113.72 A: it's like everybody's there you know at dinner and everything all the time and then all of a sudden you know it's just nothing 

113.43 114.48 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

114.66 116.34 A: so it had to be pretty rough 

116.72 123.44 B: yeah now why why do you why do you think people ah get divorced these days why's why's it increased so much 

122.06 128.97 A: [noise] um i'm thinking money issues you know a lot of people are probably getting married when they're younger 'cause they think they're in love 

129.34 137.60 A: and and you know you're getting married like eighteen nineteen twenty and you're really not finished you know doing what you wanna do 

137.82 144.06 A: and so you you kinda just realize that wasn't the person you wanted to be with [sigh] and so 

144.23 156.36 A: and then you're more or less just it doesn't work out so i'm sure the the rate is like in a younger crowd you know in like the twenties the divorce rate's higher than if you got married in your thirties or forties 

156.53 159.64 A: or something like that and money issues 

159.95 167.24 A: you know a lot of people they argue about money and they get into it thinking it's gonna be one thing and then it's a little harder than what they thought [noise] [noise] 

166.54 171.25 B: [noise] yeah i don't well money or just just like not thinking it out 

171.09 173.77 A: yeah probably not thinking it out [noise] 

173.14 177.90 B: i gue- you know that they're all they're just they just jump like right into it 

177.52 179.14 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

178.82 187.35 B: and i you know and then they realize you know that it was a stupid mistake pe- i dunno like people don't i don't think take it that seriously 

187.40 193.46 B: they don't think you know well i'll spend the rest of my life it's just like let's get married 'cause we we're you know we're in love with each other 

193.21 195.53 A: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah [sigh] 

193.82 195.92 B: (( so let's go rush off and do that [noise] )) 

196.30 200.12 A: so were you [sigh] you thinking about marriage any time soon 

199.80 201.14 B: (( ah i'm st- )) 

201.09 215.78 B: not not really and you know i i i fig- i figure have to [noise] get you know go to college first then get a job and y- ha- be able to support myself before i have a w- you know a wife and that's that's i guess that's that's um some of the money thing you know 

202.96 204.26 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

213.92 221.02 A: that's that's a good yeah that's a good thing to do 'cause i almost did it back i guess when i was nineteen 

221.18 231.49 A: and then ah we called it off and i went on to school [sigh] but i went to like four different schools and finally in in ninety eight i was through with school and um 

231.44 240.37 A: you know i'm not married now but i'm i'm thinking about it [sigh] maybe but you know it's someone i've been with for like six years on and you know 

240.42 247.00 A: i like went off to school and came back but i'm i'm st- still with her now and [sigh] so i'm thinking that ah 

247.62 259.24 A: that it you know if i got married it would be for for good and if i would've done it back you know whenever i was like right out of highschool or something like that i don't think it would've lasted two three years [noise] 

251.36 252.47 B: yeah 

259.52 267.86 B: yeah 'cause i too too immature back then you know you don't you don't really you're just beginning to move out on your own like nineteen and just 

267.31 279.28 A: [noise] oh man there was just so much stuff i hadn't done and and you know and then if i'd been married and trying to be and then you you know you wanna go out with your friends and it just you just really can't do that when you're married you know 

279.04 286.10 B: yeah i've ah yeah have to come home and especially if you have kids or something that'd just be crazy 

285.61 295.15 A: [noise] see that's i think that's another reason a lot of people are getting married too 'cause they get you know they're getting pregnant and then [sigh] they get married thinking that that's what they're gonna do 

289.02 290.60 B: oh yeah 

294.80 297.70 B: yeah they really think they have to get married and yeah 

295.18 296.19 A: (( [cough] )) 

296.90 300.78 A: yeah and then it doesn't work out and then it's kinda bad for the child 

300.76 302.36 B: (( i [noise] yeah )) 

305.79 306.36 A: (( [noise] )) 

306.49 310.55 A: [sigh] um but ten minutes is a while isn't it [laughter] when you think about it 

309.02 310.45 B: yeah it is 

310.68 312.85 A: yeah 

312.11 314.40 B: [noise] let's see well what else about marriage 

314.73 315.97 B: um 

315.54 316.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

317.21 319.07 B: (( let let's see well what [mn] )) 

317.90 322.46 A: so so how did you how did you deal with it when when the divorce happened 

322.16 327.11 B: oh i just [sigh] well like you know there it wasn't just 

327.17 329.90 B: you know there was always fighting and stuff 

327.45 328.26 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

328.76 331.96 A: [mn] would you say you were like twelve when it happened 

331.38 335.11 B: ye- yeah something like that ah around that age in lower school 

334.06 344.75 A: yeah that's a bad time anyway for you know your life anyway because you're coming [sigh] from being a kid to a teenager and you know you wanting to do all these things but you're really not old enough to go do all these things and 

337.52 338.28 B: ye- 

344.05 345.28 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

344.53 350.21 A: [sigh] and so to throw that into it that makes it worse you hate everybody and you know 

350.07 351.47 B: (( well i didn't like )) 

350.41 356.55 A: not that you re- not that you really do but you know it's just you're kinda confused at growing up [cough] [noise] 

355.02 368.05 B: [laughter] i sorta just like stayed home and watched t._v. you know like after school and stuff like that [sigh] but um yeah it it wasn't like it was better off like i i think of it i'm not like saying ah they should be back together again 

358.92 360.25 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

367.95 377.06 B: but you 'cause 'cause my mom was like she had problems and she wasn't happy i guess so they you know they fight and stuff and they yeah they 

368.18 369.20 A: yeah 

375.54 390.50 A: [noise] [noise] [sigh] so it kinda [mn] it kinda was a relief more or less then to you know wasn't any more fighting as much you know they probably still argued about things afterwards but it really wasn't [noise] like right there in front of you and stuff all the time 

379.05 380.26 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

389.92 390.94 B: yeah 

390.46 391.07 A: (( [sigh] )) 

391.51 405.24 B: and so you know i i i i've dealt with it now and you know i'm i'm fine with that i just i just i i see my mom like once a week she lives like forty minutes away from me she's remarried but my dad's not [laughter] 

391.85 392.73 A: so

410.23 412.71 B: well my mom 

412.99 424.29 B: she like she she was she ba- she's like the type that would've jumped into it if she could've found like a guy who was willing like sh- i she was like engaged like 

424.31 427.44 B: two two or three times afterwards 

426.71 430.06 A: [noise] yeah she just like wanting somebody there 

429.48 437.45 B: yeah like in in and th- none of these relationships would've actually worked out 'cause [mn] the guys were like total losers 

430.36 431.50 A: (( somebody in )) 

434.90 435.85 A: yeah 

437.59 442.81 B: so you know she but she but she you know she always like telling us well we're gonna get married you know 

442.89 447.37 B: i guess it was it was something that you know she needed somebody else in her life 

447.16 453.80 A: [noise] some people are like that they just have to have somebody else you know to make 'em feel like [sigh] a person i guess and and 

448.11 449.30 B: (( yeah to )) 

452.99 453.78 B: make 

454.10 455.50 B: yeah make 'em feel

458.31 462.76 B: they feel like only like a half of a person and they have to have somebody else with them 

462.20 464.03 A: [noise] so is she doing good now 

463.56 467.51 B: well yeah yeah after after that you know she she 

467.28 473.34 B: i guess she came to the lord and and she she she says you know she 

469.56 470.85 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

473.23 482.65 B: she you know she got better and then she met this guy at church and he's like an ex pastor or whatever so they're do- they're doing she's doing good and she's happy [noise] 

482.61 487.63 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] i still think a lot of people if they you know get into church and do that together and stuff then 

487.67 492.11 A: it they they have a better chance of working out and and things working out then ah 

492.35 495.71 A: you know people who are going out partying and clubbing and all that stuff 

494.22 495.30 B: yeah 

495.61 496.75 B: (( yeah )) 

495.93 500.16 A: i mean there's nothing wrong with that 'cause i did that i went out to the clubs and all that stuff 

500.18 503.69 A: [sigh] and and you know i don't see anything wrong with it 'cause [sigh] 

503.82 513.90 A: you can make your own choices but if you're gonna be married and you really wanna do something with it yeah yeah it's it's best to probably [sigh] find a church and you know 

507.30 510.38 B: yeah if you're finding somebody else you know 

513.87 520.42 A: get get some type of religion no matter what it is you know no matter what you believe in if it makes you a better person then 

520.39 530.01 A: then you know i'm all for that but i think they you know they they have a better chance if you get somebody and then you get that in common and and that's your main focus 

530.23 535.86 A: you know going to church we do this we're gonna be happy i'm gonna work i'm gonna come home stuff like that 

535.39 545.01 B: [noise] yeah yeah and now they and they and but you but the funny thing you know with with that guy like she knew him for like a month 

536.78 537.86 A: and then ah 

544.66 545.94 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

545.92 554.82 B: uh before before they were already ready to get married so i you know i it it's it's la- lasted for like over a year now

575.98 579.63 A: yeah see i think that's a big problem too people rushing into stuff 

579.45 592.18 A: 'cause you really don't know that you know you don't know the person if you've [sigh] if if you've only known 'em for like you know six months even a year it's not like someone you've known all your life you don't know how they how they were in the past you don't know anything about 'em really [sigh] 

587.73 588.90 B: yeah
