0.18 1.56 A: hi i'm glen 

3.62 4.42 A: (( hello how )) 

4.00 6.12 B: oh hello hello i'm rika 

6.22 7.21 A: you doing today 

7.01 8.75 B: i'm fine how are you [laughter] 

8.47 9.47 A: (( good )) 

9.38 10.52 B: good 

10.75 19.42 A: so the the question it it was i i didn't catch the entire question but it sounds like has the has the increase in the divorce rate changed your behaviour or changed your outlook on 

19.68 22.17 A: on marriage is that sort of the idea 

21.85 24.32 B: oh no i'm not married 

23.50 26.36 A: no no but i think that's is that the question we're supposed to be answering 

26.31 29.95 B: oh no i thought it was family values yeah something about divorce [laughter] 

30.14 35.07 A: yeah well the general topic was family values but i think they wanted us to address the divorce question well 

34.53 37.47 B: okay well that's cool do you know what the question 

36.31 39.76 A: that's the impression i have here you been have you been married 

39.12 40.14 B: no 

40.95 41.91 B: no 

41.09 44.07 A: (( are are are you intending to get married )) 

43.05 44.97 B: one day hopefully 

45.75 47.38 A: do you intend to have children 

47.02 50.01 B: [laughter] uh yeah i do have children though but i'm not married 

49.79 50.62 A: uh-huh 

50.40 53.11 B: i'm not married because of the divorce rate thing 

53.53 56.96 A: (( but you had a divorce yeah you didn't have a divorce because you were never married )) 

54.64 55.71 B: no 

56.36 63.05 B: yeah i'm not married because of that it's like people are marrying for the wrong reasons therefore everybody's getting divorced 

62.53 68.09 A: oh so were you ever you got pregnant but you [mn] you knew that you didn't want to marry so you just didn't get married 

67.59 69.52 B: yeah 

68.59 69.72 A: that makes sense 

69.68 73.07 B: yeah have you have you ever been married 

69.79 71.62 A: (( i i agree with you you know )) 

72.45 82.49 A: uh-uh i haven't no but it but it makes sense to me that that even even a circumstance like that where you have all every reason to get married you still shouldn't get married unless you want to [mn] uh 

81.40 82.73 B: exactly 

82.44 84.00 A: 'cause if you're sitting there 

83.76 92.48 A: and you're miserable with each other and yet you're in a life you didn't choose you're gonna that's gonna that's [mn] that at so- at some point the kids are gonna pick up on that they're gonna be like 

86.75 88.28 B: (( mhm )) 

92.38 98.87 A: you know and [mn] and i think uh uh i don't know about you and i'm not i haven't raised a child but my impression is from everything i've ever seen about children 

98.51 99.49 B: mhm 

99.67 112.06 A: that they um that they do kind of model after their their parents and they they pick up things emotionally and they kind of gauge what how they should feel in in life you know and and if their parents are miserable i think it's harder to be a happy child if you're parents are 

107.81 108.64 B: uh-huh 

111.94 119.06 A: or if if you get the sense that your parents are sort of stuck in an unhappy situation than if your parents are real kind of interactive and happy with you you know 

115.55 116.95 B: that's true 

118.92 126.39 B: that's the truth though children model i mean a child is not does not learn to be bad there they see it do you understand 

125.32 137.65 A: well not just their behaviour but also like their emotional you know their emo- how they actually feel about their li- how their life and the world you know i think they even model that part of it to some extent like if when i when i was around my parents and they were upset it was a little bit 

127.71 128.74 B: yeah 

137.81 146.73 A: upsetting you know so it was and they and my parents fought a fair amount so i think that i'd probably like it'd be probably like it affected my emotional life where where 

138.95 140.28 B: you could tell 

145.65 147.43 B: were your parents divorced 

147.39 161.14 A: no my parents were married and they they you know and they have a a stable marriage i think most people they they seem to be fairly happy now but they fought a lot growing up and a lot of the reason they fought was over differing philosophies about how to raise children and uh and my mom was sort of an autho- 

158.91 159.98 B: oh 

161.66 176.38 A: [mn] strict disciplinarian type and my dad was kind of like you know really easy going easy to get along with mellow liked to do his own thing just work as long as the kids don't get in trouble do what they want you know kind of a different sort of a style style to my mom wanted to teach us to to think the way she thought you know 

175.98 177.49 B: mhm 

176.86 185.60 A: and it it caused problems it caused some conflict and they and they there was it was plus there they had other things that other so those sort of things that i'm not even [mn] completely [mn] um 

185.84 192.29 A: familiar with but i know that that there was something about their interaction when i was growing up that made them um 

192.81 200.38 A: that that caused them to have some kind of a there was some kind of an emotional dynamic and i i don't know if i got if i always g- got exactly what was happening with them 

200.62 212.69 A: just normal man man woman things that you know my mom or my mom felt threatened or didn't feel like she was getting enough attention or maybe she thought he was wasn't the man she wanted you know just little things that they little stuff like that that and uh 

212.74 225.30 A: maybe she wanted more of a [mn] but if i had my dad been sort of more forceful figure they'd have fought constantly because she was pretty forceful and he was pretty easy going you know had had that had that changed man it would've been a co- it would've been like a state of war in my house so um 

220.65 221.63 B: well 

224.67 227.83 B: well compromise is a major part of marriage number one 

226.94 234.25 A: yeah i know it is but it's all that's true but it's also nice to get a good match where you don't have to make a million serious compromises you know 

233.66 234.91 B: right 

234.53 235.87 A: (( you know so )) 

235.21 238.91 B: but as we grow we learn to compromise especially in a relationship 

239.14 241.54 B: so you never actually been directly 

241.59 245.09 B: exposed to like a major divorce or anything like that 

244.60 259.56 A: no actually i haven't i i've um you know i i sort of have the sense that um children of divorced of of divorced parents are [mn] aren't as good a candidates for [mn] for a long term relationships if you know if it ha- if it happens especially if it happened like in the middle of their childhood 

259.47 265.86 A: sometimes it happens when you get to be twenty twenty well you know if the parents split at when the kids are twenty they've already sort of grown up and formed their views 

265.35 267.01 B: and they can accept it better 

266.65 279.73 A: yeah but but they tend to they have you know children of divorced parents have a higher divorce rate too so you know and i don't nec- i don't necessarily think divorce is always a bad thing i mean you know sometimes divorce is like okay these people really aren't a good match they they go find somebody [mn] you know it's like 

279.86 293.26 A: you know it's like going shopping at the store you get something that doesn't really quite work right for you well get something that is right for you and that'll be the next and be right for somebody else you date 'em you you know you're be right for somebody else and let's get it sort it out and get it get it right yeah what's that 

289.27 291.85 B: well that's why you have to do it right the first time 

292.71 296.37 B: that's why you really have to do it [laughter] right the first time so there won't be a second yeah 

296.27 307.38 A: yeah well do it right the first time but if you make a mistake [mn] you know i'm i'm in favor of acknowledging the mistake and and divorcing and getting making doing it right as opposed to like living in a state of agony you know or a state of just 

307.23 313.20 A: a you know discomfort or unhappiness or or or bad you know like bad vibe kind of a thing so 

309.08 310.59 B: yeah exactly 

312.19 318.27 B: well i think my mom when she married uh when she divorced her first husband and it was a good thing and i was young at the time 

316.98 317.68 A: mhm 

318.13 319.34 A: mhm 

318.72 324.94 B: you know but then she was [mn] you know blessed to find another man and he turned out to be a better 

323.47 329.86 A: how old how old were you when your how old were you when your parents divorced ten did that did that affect your views on marriage 

326.08 327.01 B: ten 

327.32 328.22 B: ten 

329.56 333.87 B: it didn't because my mom had found a man that 

334.48 335.99 B: was just wonderful 

335.79 336.83 A: mhm 

336.28 338.32 B: and see she's still with this man 

338.55 339.23 A: mhm 

338.61 340.96 B: and the views the things that i saw 

340.99 349.03 B: her with this new her new husband was different things that i didn't see growing up with her first husband you understand so that was a bad match 

346.64 356.36 A: yeah so you actually benefit you actually bene- you actually benefitted from the change of the change of yeah right right and see so that's i mean that's a good point 'cause i think you can benefit from the change of uh 

349.82 352.53 B: yeah yeah that was a bad match you know 

356.41 360.51 A: from the ch- you know a- and i know a lot of families don't like divorce under any circumstances but 

360.70 372.35 A: a good example is someone that benefitted from you know kind of like a a mo- like a move towards more compatibility and happiness in a in a relationship you can kind of see that you actually learned about good relationships and bad relationships growing up then you know 

363.15 364.25 B: yeah 

366.07 367.16 B: yeah 

367.53 368.64 B: definitely 

370.49 383.82 B: yeah had she never divorced this man i would probably would've never had such a powerful father figure now and that that is shaping my opinion as far as divorce i'm not going to get married until it's right because i saw what a good man and what a good woman do towards 

383.62 388.61 B: to help each other stay together i did see that and i saw a bad relationship too 

385.18 386.21 A: (( mhm )) 

388.82 395.19 A: mhm do your do your children are your children comfortable with the situation [mn] child or children however many you have is they are they happy in their 

389.00 390.01 B: (( you know )) 

393.97 396.57 B: oh yeah oh yeah my children are very happy 

396.39 397.29 A: yeah 

396.60 405.44 B: because i keep a strong sense of love in the house because they know mommy's going to married one day but it will be to the right person and they know certain things i'm looking for 

402.91 412.91 A: yeah and you know as long as they don't feel like you know i i kind of would've felt i think [mn] had when i was a child if my mother wasn't married i would've felt not so much that i wanted a father but that i wanted my mother to have someone 

412.88 413.72 B: uh-huh 

412.91 415.96 A: i don't know what children are like but that sort of seems like as long as they don't 

415.82 423.95 A: as so i you know it's sort of like being i if i were in that position i'd be like oh don't worry about me i'll do you know like [mn] you know i'm going to be ha- i'll you know you have your own obliga- 

423.73 437.85 A: obligation to make your your own lives happy and i'll do what i can with my life you know whereas opposed to having the kids kind of worry about it and i was i was kind of worried because my mom really like broke down once or twice and was like upset and thought her d- thought my dad was having an affair i was really really young i don't think he was 

427.59 428.71 B: mhm 

437.75 442.90 A: and i don't even know actually but it it it didn't ever seem to come up again but but i always kind of felt like 

443.01 449.41 A: they they needed each other at some emotional level that went beyond whether they even loved each other you know it just sort of went beyond [mn] 

449.37 461.69 A: you know they could be completely miserable but they somehow or other ha- which is almost pathological right i mean sort of like that's sick man if you're with each other even though you aren't happy but they were we we were catholic and that was the way that that they looked at it you know so 

454.57 455.55 B: mhm 

460.79 464.42 B: oh yeah most catholics don't believe in divorce anyway 

463.65 472.46 A: no they didn't and my my my my my mother changed to a different religion l- like you know like ten years ago we- well after we were gone uh you know like we were grown 

472.29 479.02 A: grown a- adults and all that but but she still doesn't believe in divorce you know um and they didn't growing up and whenever 

476.05 477.32 B: mhm 

477.35 480.45 B: well i mean i'm not catholic and i don't believe in divorce 

479.83 492.39 A: i ain't i'm not even religious and i divorce to me it's like i don't believe in it but i then on the other hand if if if i see a situation that's i mean i you know it isn't i i don't i wouldn't really want to be thinking of it as a possibility right i'd want to get married and love the person and want to say with them 

492.01 493.14 B: mhm 

492.29 497.65 A: but but on the other hand if you see a situation obviously where like for some reason i [mn] you know 

497.42 508.87 A: they just [mn] either either they didn't they didn't think very well on the first in the first place and weren't a good match or they just changed one of them one of them [mn] one of them or both of 'em just changed and they just have totally different like lives you know 

508.54 509.50 B: mhm 

508.82 514.13 A: somebody gets into something the other person doesn't get into in life and they just want to do sort like have do a totally different 

513.91 527.47 A: [mn] you know maybe one of them like likes recreation and wants to be outdoors all the time and the other one wants to stay home or go to movies and you know it's like that kind of a thing where and that's sort of typical man woman actually that where they have like such different activities sometimes you know minnesota where i'm from 

525.65 526.31 B: (( mhm )) 

527.40 529.39 A: i was remarking to my friends that um 

529.45 536.07 A: it's it's a to- it's a totally different like [mn] in in l. a. i think the p- the people they they sort of hang out more and do the same sort of things 

535.87 548.67 A: in minnesota like the men like they do their hunting fishing sports that kind of thing the women they go off together and they and they talk and they you know they talk about their children and that kind of thing it's like they ta- they don't have like the same interests like ur- urban couples do you know 

548.58 560.06 A: they [mn] they grew up with this kind of like they don't know each other in a in a certain way you know they don't really like they don't share the men and the women where i'm from their social world their social world's are a bit different than they are here 

548.80 549.44 B: (( mm )) 

553.61 555.20 B: who doesn't know each other 

556.36 557.39 B: really 

558.87 562.22 B: so they're like two separate entities just living together 

560.80 568.46 A: they are different live- well from what i see the women yeah from what i see the women bond as as friends the men bond as friends the men get together 

566.92 568.81 B: but they don't bond with each other 

568.48 579.21 A: right in a in a really in an important way you know they have their family and they're around each other and that kind of a thing but what what i see of it when they're out you know what i see what i see of them socially at least that's what i have to gauge it gauge it from 

569.14 570.68 B: that's strange 

579.84 591.43 A: uh you know the women like to get together and talk the men get together and talk and it's like and they're absolutely separated you know they're like separate groups here are the women over here talking it's like they don't even have enough in common that they can sit in the same circle and talk 

579.91 580.88 B: (( i would )) 

587.41 588.15 B: (( oh )) 

590.93 594.21 B: and that's bad i wouldn't want to live a separate life from my husband 

591.91 593.61 A: i well i think it's bad too 

593.94 599.89 A: i think it's bad too i think you know [mn] and you know [mn] it's not like i want a mirror image of myself but i want someone that has some of the same interests
