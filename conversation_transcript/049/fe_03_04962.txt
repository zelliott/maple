33.94 38.21 A: okay so the topic is censorship 

37.38 49.47 B: censorship and she had said something about ah with kids in school should they be allowed 'cause at first i was i'm thinking censorship censorship you know i'm thinking movies or what but they said something about 

42.08 43.50 A: okay 

49.46 59.38 A: yes ce- certain schools be be able to yeah should the books should the school districts be able to ban certain books 

49.53 50.43 B: kids

53.54 54.58 B: (( yeah )) 

57.40 58.54 B: to choose 

58.71 59.63 B: yes 

59.93 61.30 A: and i guess [mn] 

61.44 68.23 A: i'm not sure how i feel about that i mean i guess it depends on who's censoring the books and why 

67.87 80.57 B: yes that's what i 'cause i'm thinking okay what's what am i 'cause i ha- don't have kids but i do have two nephews so you know and that's that would be a big thing whether they're mine though or not 

74.16 75.08 A: (( okay okay )) 

81.08 83.42 B: yeah kind of how you would take that 

84.10 86.03 B: and like you said who's doing it 

85.65 88.87 A: mhm right and why why are these books being 

89.07 92.09 A: censored for for what reason 

91.86 92.97 B: yes 

93.06 96.95 A: and ah i i think books 

97.96 104.74 A: ah i i'm not really sure i mean are they talking about books in the classroom that they're gonna use in the curriculum or 

104.80 108.86 A: books that are just in the library for them to ah mm 

109.13 113.39 B: yeah that's kind of yeah i'm not sure about that one now for the library 

113.44 117.05 B: you know yeah there probably should be some censorship 

118.67 126.50 A: but who determines what kind of books should be banned and i i think that's kind of a dangerous um 

119.79 121.00 B: yes 

126.99 130.25 A: it reminds me of the mccarthy era 

129.58 130.57 B: uh-huh 

130.31 134.11 A: or you know the the red scare or something 

134.45 139.11 B: yeah that that's yeah that's kind of tough which way to take that 

140.50 146.83 A: i don't know yeah like if they had given me given us a for instance what kind of books they would ban mm mm 

146.10 149.72 B: yeah they didn't go into that 'cause i was listening real close 

150.58 156.16 B: yeah that's kind of i guess some guess just have to try to do the best you can with 

156.44 158.02 B: how it would go 

157.60 164.63 A: right i mean and is it because they're protect the children or from something or is it because you're trying to 

164.71 168.26 A: withhold information from them 

167.69 168.64 B: uh-huh 

168.71 173.46 A: because look at what they're already exposed to just on television 

173.05 176.29 B: yes yeah they're exposed to a lot already 

175.54 176.98 A: (( right so )) 

177.51 186.84 B: so to a degree you know to some extent it might be that you you do want the kids to be aware of things 

186.11 187.32 A: right 

188.08 192.10 B: so you probably would have to almost go something like that on 

192.21 196.77 B: who's doing it or what the subjects are what the books are about 

194.50 195.69 A: mhm 

197.34 198.84 B: as if they're 

198.91 202.67 B: you know things going into x. rated now that might be something different 

201.71 211.95 A: yeah i mean i don't i don't i don't really believe in banning books but then certain books are not appropriate for a school library 

211.36 214.19 B: yes or it could be the age 

214.03 215.13 A: (( right mhm )) 

214.88 218.79 B: you know you would have to be careful too a little bit with an age 

221.04 227.86 A: so i and i don't know what the rules are now i mean like can they have any book in a school library 

228.87 233.63 A: or would it just be books that are appropriate just for 

233.98 235.53 A: young people um 

234.91 239.18 B: yeah for that age or if you're like in an ele- more of an elementary type s- 

239.35 242.93 B: um school or the high schools 

243.13 245.97 B: yeah that's kind of yeah that i'm not sure 

246.36 254.02 B: that's kind of tough 'cause i'm not real familiar with school libraries and what they've got and don't and 

248.49 249.85 A: [laughter] 

254.00 255.59 A: go in the back [noise] 

256.31 259.25 A: oh go no if you have to go to the restroom go in the back 

260.29 263.77 A: [noise] yeah in the back in the kitchen there's a bathroom back there 

265.36 266.83 A: sorry my daughter's 

265.64 266.54 B: that's okay 

266.90 269.18 A: my daughter's just coming in 

268.85 269.83 B: oh 

269.93 272.52 B: yeah that that's kind of tough for that 

272.96 278.71 B: yeah 'cause i debated when i started the call i thought do i wanna do this and i thought oh i'll just go ahead and give it a try 

276.98 278.20 A: [laughter] 

278.54 280.18 A: i know um 

279.42 286.03 B: but yeah i was kind iffy 'cause like i said i was almost even thinking censorships with t._v.s or shows or 

285.66 300.25 A: mhm right and i i actually think children can learn from subjects that are controversial so i don't think those type of books should be banned and then there's already so much smut and 

295.05 295.93 B: uh-huh 

300.49 309.10 A: [mn] everything on be- between the television and the video games and that they're already exposed to you know i i 

308.59 315.77 B: yes so that they're actually seeing things and in a book they're just reading it 

311.77 312.97 A: right 

315.50 319.21 A: right so i don't see what the sense would be 

318.66 320.70 B: (( yeah )) 

319.42 320.45 A: you know 

320.72 323.72 A: and i i think it's up to the parents i don't know mhm 

324.12 332.19 B: yes hopefully the parents would be involved in it and you know they might be able to determine what they actually want their child to read 

332.66 334.18 B: themselves 

333.85 345.63 A: do you remember any instances like when you were in school of what books were banned i remember clockwork orange was banned right you remember clockwork 

343.86 345.95 B: oh that i'm not sure 

345.98 347.86 B: i i don't remember 

347.40 350.86 A: i'm trying to think of what books were banned ah 

352.85 363.27 A: [noise] i i remember ah the scarlet letter was banned at one time [noise] but now that's a you know a literary classic 

358.23 359.18 B: uh-huh 

362.77 363.80 B: yes 

363.47 368.51 A: so i think it just depends charlotte she went to the bathroom [noise] 

371.01 376.34 A: so i don't know i think it depends on the the times and 

375.52 379.20 B: the ti- yeah the time the age and 

378.58 381.25 A: and the reason the book is being banned 

380.21 383.50 B: ban- yes and who's doing it like you said 

383.25 384.67 A: right 

385.67 394.42 B: yeah that one that one's kind of tough on [laughter] 'cause there's so many things you don't yeah who and why and 

389.57 390.90 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

396.20 402.59 A: yeah i would have to know what books specifically they were considering banning and why 

402.87 403.90 B: yes 

403.78 412.01 A: that that's a big if so right off the top i would say no i don't i don't believe books should be banned 

413.49 421.09 B: yeah i mean that's a very good point 'cause like we said you know t._v.s and all the stuff out and just in everyday life 

421.04 422.07 A: (( mhm okay )) 

421.10 423.18 B: like kids actually see 

422.68 425.23 A: yeah so where are you from 

424.83 425.86 B: ohio 

425.75 427.68 A: ohio okay okay 

427.70 429.76 B: near the cleveland area 

430.72 433.36 A: so i i have three children 

433.10 434.07 B: uh-huh 

433.57 435.49 A: and i'm i'm already 

435.53 441.15 A: like i won't get cable television because of you know television is just so 

441.00 447.80 B: there is so much stuff and it used to be that some things was on later now it's not even on later 

442.37 443.79 A: right 

447.41 448.45 A: (( right i )) 

447.85 450.17 B: so they're actually seeing 

450.54 454.49 B: the stuff on you know there's so much stuff they're seeing on t._v. or hearing 

453.62 458.67 A: know i know and it's right it's now it's on regular television you don't even have to 

457.24 458.15 B: yes 

458.84 463.16 A: have cable all you have to do is turn those talk shows on 

462.57 468.99 B: yeah the talk shows or even just some of the half an hour shows some of the subjects and some of the stuff that goes on them 

467.51 468.56 A: right 

468.71 475.60 A: so i wish that they would censor some of that stuff i don't think that stuff should be on the on in the daytime 

474.94 481.09 B: yes that it always used it was or you always thought it was to be kept later at night 

475.86 477.25 A: because they're 

481.56 485.12 B: so yeah just in a book they're reading it 

483.22 484.01 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

486.89 493.35 A: now can you imagine how many small children are home during the day watching television unsupervised 

493.37 494.29 B: yes 

494.65 499.59 A: and they're they're seeing that stuff so i think by the time they get to school 

499.99 502.64 A: (( i don't what can shock them anymore )) 

501.82 512.16 B: yeah yeah there isn't much left and in libraries and yeah and that they're not they're just reading it they're not seeing pictures or hearing people 

504.10 505.32 A: [laughter] 

512.58 513.85 A: (( right right )) 

514.16 518.39 B: yeah that yeah that's a big thing to think about when you look at it 

518.56 527.65 B: different ways you know when you first started thinking about it you know before we started the subject it's like you think different ways and then after you know bringing up points with that 

527.73 530.55 B: it gives you a thing to think about it a little bit different 

531.96 536.38 B: because there's so much other stuff that kids see and hear and 

536.97 540.03 B: just in everyday life as opposed to what can 

538.25 539.09 A: yeah 

540.55 542.46 B: what can they get in a book 

542.00 544.75 A: right yeah right i i think it's a harsh 

545.11 549.59 A: reality that they that children have to deal with today 

550.04 553.00 A: and they have to be equipped i mean we 

553.27 556.22 A: ah i i don't think we should 

556.95 561.56 A: (( [sigh] ban books because they have to know what's you know what's out there right right mhm )) 

561.71 563.20 B: what's out there 

563.50 566.85 B: i mean you can protect the child so much 

567.03 567.92 B: (( but i )) 

568.27 570.43 B: mean they gotta know what's going on 

569.84 574.82 A: right and then use the book to educate them about the the subject 

574.76 575.60 B: yes 

574.88 577.62 A: use it as a point of discussion i 

577.68 582.43 A: mean you don't just let them read anything and just go for themselves but 

583.41 584.32 A: you know 

584.70 589.92 A: [mn] make the book books available and then have a discussion about it so 

589.63 590.66 B: yes 

594.22 597.17 A: that sounds reasonable to me 

596.52 598.27 B: yes i would think so 

599.31 599.89 B: yeah 

599.47 599.89 A: (( [mn] ))
