0.17 1.28 A: hello 

2.09 3.24 B: (( hello )) 

2.87 4.72 A: hello hi this is mike 

5.16 6.16 B: hi 

7.45 10.52 A: [noise] so like i guess this is ah we're talking about 

10.55 13.89 A: whether public or private schools should um 

14.05 17.58 A: [lipsmack] you know limit the books and types things could be read [noise] 

18.91 19.94 B: okay 

19.59 22.19 A: [laughter] so i guess we're supposed to discuss that 

22.26 25.63 B: okay are the public or private schools what now 

25.36 34.69 A: i i think what i heard was [cough] whether they should limit the types of books and stuff in other words censorship of the kind of books that the students are allowed to read 

34.70 36.06 B: mhm 

35.42 38.96 A: so i don't know if you have strong feelings about that or or not 

39.84 40.62 B: (( mm )) 

42.43 43.71 B: (( not really do you )) 

43.97 54.74 A: no i i guess ah i can um i think it's good for 'em to allow you know the to have a lot wide variety of books and things i could see where maybe certain types of books 

55.11 62.76 A: you know if they were pornographic or or there are certain type of things that they might not [laughter] obviously have in public schools or private schools depending on 

62.98 64.98 B: right 

63.04 74.87 A: what their their i could see that i mean but ah as far as letting them to read you know different books that would have ah a lot of degree of different ah viewpoints and ideas i think would be real good 

74.55 76.07 B: mhm 

75.54 76.58 A: (( but ah )) 

77.09 91.14 A: i guess sometimes you get into places where they don't you know want 'em to [sigh] to read certain books that would i guess that would maybe espouse a different ideals than you know i guess what you'd say mainstream but i don't see that that's necessarily good 

86.40 88.06 B: right 

91.53 103.47 A: i mean you know censorship like that 'cause i could see where if someone wanted to i guess read [sigh] i'm trying to think of of what types of books i've seen recently that there's been issues about but ah 

93.99 94.87 B: no 

103.99 112.21 A: i i you know i i would think that ah a wide degree of [sigh] of of of allowing some freedom to read would be good 

112.00 113.69 B: mhm 

113.05 115.15 A: but i guess i guess i don't feel 

115.85 123.24 A: [sigh] i guess it's it's hard to describe i guess you know [mn] i mean i know there's a ah you know different people have different views about what they might think is 

123.33 130.72 A: is not acceptable you know too sexually explicit or something like that but i you know i i guess it would depend on on the 

128.78 130.05 B: right 

130.76 139.48 A: on you know on how how explicit it was you know obviously a lot of the literature has certain things th- th- that some people could feel is objectionable but i don't 

139.64 140.65 B: mhm 

139.74 151.22 A: as a whole i don't think it'd necessarily be bad i guess it i guess you have to say when you the schools it'd depend on what age group age age level i could see where they wouldn't you know they might make some distinction between a high school 

151.34 152.63 B: right 

151.49 154.63 A: you know students than than like a a grade school or 

155.40 160.93 A: you know there might be certain books they wouldn't put into a an elementary school like library 

162.26 165.41 A: but i don't know i i guess i'm trying to think ah [laughter] you know 

165.78 166.80 B: yeah 

166.29 170.96 A: [laughter] you know exactly what to think on it because ah [mn] ah 

171.53 178.53 A: [lipsmack] i guess there there are some people don't think you should have any kind you know certain book types of books 'cause you wouldn't have any and you wouldn't have anything at all you know 

177.91 179.54 B: oh i know [laughter] 

179.58 191.69 A: and i i guess ah as as a whole there's there's some books that [sigh] i guess some groups would want to keep out that i can't say would necessarily be bad you know for for students to at least to be to have exposure to it 

193.58 200.00 A: i guess it really depends i don't know have you had any experience with with school systems having this as an issue 

193.78 196.00 B: mhm 

200.32 206.65 A: you know in your area 'cause 'cause i'm in the virginia area which is fairly [sigh] conservative probably anyway 

206.88 208.69 B: [lipsmack] yeah well i'm in illinois 

208.56 209.75 A: mhm 

209.12 210.45 B: and um 

210.93 211.54 B: (( i )) 

212.02 217.17 B: can't think of you know i don't know too many people that are in school right now 

216.93 217.89 A: mhm 

217.53 220.44 B: so and i don't know any kids that are in school so it's 

220.23 221.36 A: yeah 

220.81 222.29 B: kind of hard um 

222.41 224.97 A: it's a harder subject than i ever [laughter] 

223.36 231.41 B: yeah right this is hard topic to figure out right now but um you know from what i've heard um 

227.18 228.37 A: yeah 

232.05 233.76 B: (( you know i didn't )) 

233.80 236.44 B: i haven't heard anybody complaining about it so 

236.21 237.24 A: right 

237.46 239.17 A: i haven't seen it as a 

239.02 248.88 A: a big issue here either i mean pretty much they have a large variety of books i have a daughter that's a sophomore in high school and it it doesn't seem to be coming up as a real big 

248.70 262.60 A: issue here you know i mean not with the school system they have they [sigh] i mean i go in and check out books but from talking and stuff they you know have a wide variety of different types of stuff i i think the you know i i think they're 

262.63 269.53 A: probably most of the books here are you know are are ones that i would say you know have a lot of different types of books but they're 

269.66 276.56 A: like i say about the only thing i would think that probably is limited or not there is is something that you know like books that would be too sexually 

276.62 285.94 A: explicit or stuff like that they may not have but most other types of books there seem to be a wide variety of books that are available for 'em to read 

284.80 286.98 B: mhm 

286.35 294.77 A: and then of course some that they get just as regular part of their classroom activities for english and reading type you know and literature type courses and stuff 

294.80 300.92 A: [lipsmack] and i you know i think that they're fairly open about the di- you know variety of type of books that they allow 

301.04 312.55 A: and of course you know in the homes i think parents have you know some response they're there to decide you know the kinds of things just like music and stuff that they want children to [sigh] you know to use [laughter] i mean you know to to have 

310.86 312.17 B: mhm 

312.94 320.63 A: although that can be difficult too 'cause they pretty much go by peer pressure [laughter] yeah i mean to what they like to read and listen to 

317.24 318.69 B: yeah 

320.72 322.70 A: in fact some kids i think that might 

322.54 336.14 A: work against the school you know if if they made an issue of a book not being allowed it'd probably be the one that they'd all wanna read [laughter] i just just knowing how young people are [laughter] it seems like that's the way they go [laughter] 

329.65 331.07 B: right 

332.56 333.28 B: (( [laughter] )) 

336.35 337.41 A: (( but ah )) 

337.49 347.99 A: i don't know i i don't think we've run into a lot of problem with you know with it here that i least i'm not aware of it with our school systems and stuff it [sigh] it seems like we have a pretty much 

348.12 357.79 A: you know i mean they're probably conservative but at the same point i mean they're you know they do get you know there's a wide variety of books that they can you know can read and study and and u- you know check out 

349.43 352.20 B: (( yeah )) 

358.49 359.79 B: mhm 

359.06 369.87 A: i think it's the same way with our library systems you know there's not a lot of censorship i don't think it went on in in the sense that there's a a wide degree of of books that they can read 

371.45 377.90 A: so other- i'm trying to think of anything else to [laughter] to to talk about on the the issue 

371.80 373.88 B: (( all right )) 

374.40 375.57 B: mhm 

377.02 381.17 B: yeah well you probably would have more first hand knowledge than i would [laughter] 

380.64 392.39 A: right right right i think it's um i guess it's a general issue you know you can look at t._v. and everything else about what you know what degree of c- of censorship types things you you know you feel like the needs to 

392.69 395.35 A: does you know does the society need to do 

395.46 397.05 B: mhm 

395.98 406.69 A: and if that's a that's probably a tough one 'cause you want to have freedom of speech and ability of you know to people to communicate and learn and see new ideas and be exposed to things but i guess 

406.76 418.35 A: as a citizen and a p- person you kind of have to stand for your family you kind of just set your own you know your standards of you think you know are acceptable and the things that you don't want like with children you don't wanna expose them to 

419.00 420.82 A: [sigh] and i guess it really just ah i 

420.76 435.27 A: guess if different people have different viewpoints on that but i guess it it depends on well you know again things that you [mn] you know they're gonna be exposed to certain things anyway but i mean but if some of the standards like of what kind of music and stuff you want your children to listen to too 

424.42 430.20 B: mhm 

435.44 439.53 A: you know the kinds of artists and stuff you want 'em to be you know be exposed to 

440.16 443.89 A: and it's just i guess the same thing with ah you know censorship in the school 

445.22 450.67 A: yeah [lipsmack] i guess some parents just kind of you have to kind of set the some things about what you believe is right 

452.20 454.49 B: right 

453.25 458.95 A: i don't know that's not easy i guess if that [mn] i don't get involved with a lot either [laughter] 

459.45 463.17 A: but i guess it's just a matter of determining you you know what you think's right 

461.00 464.34 B: mhm that's true 

465.15 470.62 A: but i know um as for trying to think what else um if there's any other issues or anything 

471.30 472.56 A: (( [lipsmack] you know [mn] )) 

472.79 474.87 B: no i can't think of any you know 

475.13 475.93 A: yeah 

475.22 476.69 B: other issues 

477.31 479.95 A: yeah i guess it's really just a matter of um 

480.29 481.34 A: with ah 

481.56 489.55 A: the schools and stuff i guess that's where i guess if if if if someone felt like something was was not appropriate for a certain age group or something that's something you just 

489.61 497.09 A: i guess you you know you'd have to get involved with the school board and with different you know with the school administration you know if you really felt something was wrong it'd 

493.66 495.73 B: (( but mhm )) 

497.26 508.93 A: probably be something that i guess there's even you know a parent was gonna tell you you don't spend that much time going through and just even seeing what's in the library to be honest with you other than the you know open house and the times i know i'm a i'm a 

508.83 512.47 A: i work full time in a job so you only only so much time you have 

512.27 515.14 A: other than what you talk you know my daughter does talk about 

512.41 513.72 B: mhm 

514.96 527.96 A: to think about it i've never heard her talk of anything where she thinks there's a problem [laughter] you know with with what's available inside the the school library 'cause it seems like there are a number of different types of books and stuff that she can read and you know different 

521.00 523.00 B: yeah 

528.09 530.84 A: you know things that to to be exposed to [lipsmack] 

532.72 538.02 A: but i don't know [lipsmack] i i guess i'm trying to think if if anything else if you have any thoughts or ideals about it 

539.96 540.83 B: no 

541.01 542.58 A: no [laughter] 

541.78 544.78 B: no no [laughter] i really don't i 

547.84 549.64 A: yeah i gu- i guess it's just really ah 

550.32 555.00 A: i guess it's something i guess if you don't have a child in school it's a bit harder isn't it [laughter] 

554.35 555.48 B: (( mean um )) 

555.42 558.12 A: to know what to you know what to think on it 

558.41 568.47 A: [lipsmack] i guess it's the same thing with the with the when you think about it with with t._v. and stuff things seem to be get more explicit and more language and do you think that's a problem or 

568.60 569.57 A: you know with 

569.59 570.90 B: (( so mhm )) 

570.16 572.05 A: with the way that ah is happening 

572.21 574.15 B: yeah with the t._v. 

572.65 573.97 A: kind of in general 

574.01 579.09 A: yeah with t._v. and like programs there seems to be more you know there getting to be more language and 

579.39 587.01 A: and more things w- where you know a lot more suggestive things are on t._v. now than you know like say would've been ten fifteen twenty years ago 

586.97 589.25 B: oh yeah it's pretty bad now 

588.83 591.43 A: that's what i'm sa- i'm saying i guess it's the same 

591.56 596.46 A: wi- you know with the educational process about you know i mean what you know i mean you can 

596.51 599.89 A: as a parent you know you can control some of that but but 

599.05 599.95 B: (( [laughter] mhm ))
