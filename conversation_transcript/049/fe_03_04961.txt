24.40 26.28 B: (( school and ah )) 

27.35 33.26 B: ah censoring the the student's right to read certain books

33.42 35.06 A: mhm 

34.34 35.78 B: (( yeah ah )) 

35.49 37.36 A: so 

36.12 40.54 B: they didn't really say ah what age school children i guess ah 

41.21 45.61 B: i guess it i guess they probably were more or less ah 

46.12 47.23 B: um 

47.83 56.78 B: maybe pinpointed on elementary school kids because i mean high school and college kids pretty much gonna read what they wanna read 

52.80 53.62 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

55.56 63.14 A: mhm that's ri- i'm guessing it is elementary kids so i don't know why don't you tell me what you think about it 

58.93 59.97 B: yeah 

62.31 69.87 B: [noise] well ah man ah ah these days man there is so much different types of material out 

70.07 71.78 B: (( until ah )) 

72.19 81.43 B: ah [mn] i i know for myself i have to monitor my kids i have to monitor 'em real close to make sure of what they're watching and what they're reading 

76.90 78.84 A: mhm 

81.69 85.53 B: ah i i as a matter of fact i looked up one day man and ah 

82.24 84.71 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

85.75 89.94 B: and there was some pornographic material had came through the mail 

89.67 90.89 A: mhm 

90.23 100.21 B: and ah and i was sitting there trying to figure out you know where it came from and and how they came to send it to my address you know 

99.86 101.39 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

100.69 101.56 B: (( you know )) 

101.70 106.32 B: and sometimes if you're not really watching it close the kids can get a hold of it you know 

103.47 104.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

105.86 107.43 A: mhm 

107.41 108.31 B: so [noise] 

107.45 111.06 A: 'cause well basically i think like you know 

111.30 125.31 A: that's a good thing to do because like it takes one you know one source away but you know just taking one source away you know there's always you know like other places people can get whatever they want you know [noise] so it's like that's a good start but you know it's like they need to do more things too 

120.51 121.44 B: mhm 

125.62 126.71 B: yeah 

126.09 134.10 A: 'cause you know if they you know 'cause if people want to lea- know about something they can't learn about at school then they find some other place like the library or something you know i 

133.49 135.67 B: oh yeah yeah 

135.06 141.36 A: mean so like school yeah that's a good start you know 'cause that's where everyone is but you know they could take it further too 

141.36 146.10 B: well i tell you what it it's gotten a little ridiculous in schools they they 

146.20 152.46 B: it's even ah they're trying to cut out prayer in the schools what what do you think about that 

150.17 150.91 A: (( mm )) 

151.30 156.00 A: i well i go to a baptist church so i think it's kind of dumb 

155.97 157.30 B: mhm 

156.06 160.58 A: 'cause [mn] i think um that america was founded on biblical reasons you know 

160.40 161.51 B: mhm 

160.87 174.99 A: and the fact um they're using the constitution the way it wasn't meant to be used when they say that and you know and and if people are offended by that well that's just something you know that's a personal matter you know they shouldn't let make everyone else you know suffer for them 

166.68 168.52 B: [noise] yeah i agree 

173.70 183.78 B: yeah it it it and some and i i know in some instances i've heard and read where they didn't really want the kids ah reading religious material 

184.00 185.38 A: mhm 

184.06 191.03 B: ah because it infringed on other people's rights ah other people's beliefs you got so many religious beliefs 

190.21 203.97 A: yeah see i i think that's just ridiculous because if you know it's like people ch- you know they choose to read what they read you know so it's like if they want to read it you know just it's their choice you know wh- why take it away from 'em when it comes to like religion you know 

202.79 203.81 B: right 

203.88 205.58 B: yeah i i don't ah 

205.65 213.22 B: i don't think they really should stop anybody from reading any- anything let's say pornographic or l- let's say ah 

213.50 221.50 B: some of this material that you can [sigh] ah some of this material that you can obtain that teaches how to kill teaches how to 

220.67 225.56 A: yeah make a pipe bomb or what not yeah i can see them doing that yeah 

222.64 223.55 B: yeah 

224.24 235.83 B: yeah yeah i i can see that i think there's some things that are acceptable and then there are some things that are non not acceptable and and i really think that ah 

226.69 227.57 A: mhm 

232.94 234.25 A: mhm 

236.17 237.97 B: they should [mn] 

238.06 243.08 B: you know as far as the government is concerned they they should kind of leave it up to the parents to ah 

243.25 246.66 B: monitor their kids [noise] and um 

245.51 246.42 A: mhm 

246.97 256.05 B: and i mean i can understand them making certain laws and rules in the schools ah pertaining to you know very harmful material 

256.45 257.39 A: yeah 

256.49 257.32 B: (( you know )) 

259.42 261.54 A: do you say you mean by that like 

261.86 275.10 A: i don't know like there's like um back to religion again like there's so many religions out there that do you you know teach you know and some some don't but like some teach you know really violent stuff like i don't know like wicca 

275.48 276.74 B: mhm 

275.57 285.73 A: you know i can see them censoring some of it but it's like i mean books explaining it you know that's fine but like you know books that like you know like tell violent things and stuff like that 

285.50 286.37 B: mhm 

285.83 288.42 A: and you know i i can see them censoring that too 

288.41 294.67 B: oh yeah [noise] yeah and you you just think there are some religions that are violent [laughter] 

294.34 296.37 A: mhm yeah

316.98 325.44 B: ah you know other people's points of view you know what i mean and and trying to you you know you you just want to know what the other person is thinking sometimes you know 

319.59 321.91 A: mhm yeah 

324.59 326.84 A: without getting in a fight [laughter] 

325.86 330.51 B: yeah there you go and ah i'm gonna tell you i i listened to some of the stuff 

330.76 338.63 B: i listened to some of the stuff and and went to some of the meetings and some of the b- some of the ah they studied the thing called the the koran 

338.64 339.72 A: yeah 

339.13 344.30 B: and ah and i was very amazed i was very amazed 

344.43 351.54 B: at you know some of the violent tendencies and the some of the violent teachings that they taught 

351.35 354.68 A: yeah like removing the infidels and yo- you know 

353.39 356.07 B: yeah you know that that kind of thing ah 

355.53 356.44 A: mhm 

356.20 357.67 B: and um 

358.24 362.15 B: [noise] you know it was just like ah just like when they killed malcolm x 

362.27 366.79 B: yeah well how how do you murder someone in the name of religion man i mean 

362.32 363.62 A: yeah 

366.44 374.77 A: yeah ah that is that's like like an oxymoron right there you know it's like i believe in god i'm gonna kill for him you know it's just like that really opposite [noise] 

367.60 368.89 B: my god 

369.43 370.30 B: you know 

374.35 389.18 B: yeah that's and so i mean i can understand i can understand some censorship against reading certain materials in school but man i [mn] i was very very i mean i was shocked at some of the things that i heard and some of the things that i read you know 

376.96 377.59 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

389.37 390.51 B: um 

389.62 390.68 A: mhm 

391.32 394.06 B: i'm all for a man defending himself 

394.34 406.79 B: you know i'm you you know everyone has the right to defend themselves if they're attacked physically or they're attacked violently you know i feel like that but but but the teaching went far beyond that from 

394.76 395.97 A: mhm 

402.91 403.93 A: yeah 

406.74 409.52 B: from what i from from what i ah 

407.48 408.63 A: mhm 

409.72 413.02 B: experienced and from some of the things that i heard you know 

412.92 425.50 A: yeah books on like judo and tae kwon do i think that'd be fine but as long as they're explained like in a defensive manner you know like not like these you know if like someone stole your milk money or something you go beat 'em up but like in a defensive sort of manner 

425.68 428.90 A: 'cause like i used to take um karate for 

429.13 439.45 A: probably for only like three months but they were big on saying like how it was defensive you know and you know how you should never use it unless you're absolutely forced to and never use to like to take things from people you know 

439.34 441.14 B: (( [noise] right )) 

441.01 443.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

441.54 443.89 B: right you actually took ah karate 

443.82 448.57 A: yeah i did for like three months i got a white belt and one stripe which wasn't that good 

447.89 448.75 B: mhm 

448.67 450.45 A: (( but )) 

448.99 451.71 B: yeah well i've heard it ah that that they teach you 

451.75 455.19 B: they teach pacifism you know as far as 

455.51 458.95 B: ah as far as that's concerned you know they they teach ah 

457.37 458.63 A: mhm 

459.02 471.92 B: basically peace and tranquility and and that's basically a part of the teaching when when you go through that now i i never took karate but that's what i heard if you took it then you would know better then i would if they 

468.31 470.05 A: yeah it was very much like 

470.97 479.84 A: yeah it's very much like that and it's very much about respect too like they always tell you how to respect your leaders you know and you'd always address 'em as sir [mn] not the way i took it 

479.85 485.58 A: and it's you know it's always about letting the other guy you know you're always trying to back away from a fight you know 

485.33 486.32 B: mhm 

485.68 493.34 A: and like then they then they showed like us ways to like get away from fights and what not you know not just to you know 

490.77 491.99 B: mhm 

493.51 497.56 A: start a fight they made sure you know everyone that joined you know they 

497.58 503.18 A: made sure that you know it was for defense reasons not you know not offense like you see in the movies and what not 

502.89 505.31 B: mhm yeah 

504.62 507.77 A: so i i i think they were very good about it 

507.96 511.42 B: (( [noise] yeah yeah well i i i notice ah a )) 

511.61 513.69 B: lot of real young kids 

513.66 517.67 B: ah it's like they pass by some of these tae kwon do 

517.63 528.70 B: places where they go and train ah the karate places you see a lot of real young young children in there a lot of times dressed up in the little white the little white uniforms and what not 

519.90 521.03 A: mhm 

525.94 527.24 A: (( [laughter] )) 

527.36 530.41 A: yeah i i was only about five or six when i did it 

530.15 532.06 B: mhm 

530.54 536.35 A: and that that's probably why i stopped 'cause they thought i was i guess my parents thought i was too young i never got back into it again 

534.59 535.68 B: (( yeah )) 

536.32 542.47 B: yeah well i heard that they actually taught that you don't use it unless you absolutely have to 

542.24 545.32 A: yeah definitely i remember that a lot 

542.76 543.66 B: you know 

543.76 553.48 B: ah in defensive you know in defensive circumstances and circumstances where you're being attacked or you don't have any alternative 

553.09 554.91 A: mhm where you're cornered or something 

554.19 559.02 B: yeah but to use you know physical force to to defend yourself you know 

558.21 566.94 A: mhm yeah they they al- they always told us to use verbal you know to use verbal force before using physical force now just turning the back away and what not 

566.30 568.59 B: oh so you actually did that when you were five 

569.22 570.99 A: when i was what 

570.44 573.50 B: yeah i think you said you did it when you was like five years old 

572.87 574.28 A: yeah i did 

574.43 577.27 B: and you only did it for you only did it for a few months though 

577.04 579.10 A: yeah only a few months 

578.45 579.84 B: mhm 

579.16 583.44 A: so i don't know i still know a couple of stances but i'm not that good at it 

582.51 590.36 B: yeah did did they have did they have ah literary material that you that you read did you have literary material on that 

589.68 596.74 A: um they had a couple of pamphlets explaining about basically what it is and like what their goal was you know to improve mankind and what not but 

596.76 599.89 A: not like textbook sort of style not at least i 

598.77 599.54 B: (( mm ))
