7.94 10.05 A: oh not too bad [laughter] 

8.61 21.88 B: (( [laughter] so yeah yeah i guess the uh the topic is censorship um actually this is the first one i've done too so i i uh )) 

10.45 16.37 A: i didn't quite this is my first time doing this um i didn't quite catch the topic something about censorship 

22.20 24.41 B: (( i really don't know how to get it going uh )) 

24.68 28.19 B: i guess uh censor have you done any of this before 

27.51 28.63 A: no 

28.42 29.96 B: no this is your first one too 

29.72 30.69 A: yes 

30.64 33.04 B: huh okay well uh 

33.91 38.35 B: i don't know is is is censorship a a issue that's that's particularly hot right now or i 

38.79 39.70 A: uh 

38.91 45.83 B: haven't uh i haven't been aware of any headlines that that are directly directly about censorship 

45.27 49.40 A: um no i haven't either uh well there was a 

49.78 54.37 A: couple of years ago there was an issue at our high school that 

54.62 59.39 A: i guess you would call it censorship and uh it did cause a stink locally 

59.49 61.92 A: and that is when um 

62.60 64.39 A: when nine eleven happened 

64.30 66.62 B: (( right )) 

65.38 66.70 A: they 

66.89 68.30 A: uh at first 

68.98 72.50 A: had the some of the students turn a the t._v.s on 

72.68 73.62 B: uh-huh 

72.95 81.63 A: and as they see it un- un- unveil and seeing what was ac- you know that it was more than what they first thought they did have the schools turn it off 

81.88 85.58 A: and uh i really i i could see it for grade school 

85.66 87.74 B: right 

85.89 97.10 A: but but for high school i i disagreed with it and i think most people did even the students you know they said they they try to teach us history and here it is happening before us and you don't let us watch it 

97.67 110.13 B: right i think that's actually an interesting point the uh i did notice um for example uh as soon as um they gained the ability to start broadcast again again in iraq 

110.08 119.33 B: um it started showing all kinds of you know footage about the war that uh americans hadn't been privy to you know certainly anything that was 

119.38 126.89 B: an atrocity or something had been caused or created or or not you know stopped by the american or uh 

126.67 134.53 B: english forces um were actually you know being shown quite liberally over there and understandably not here 

134.76 135.71 A: right 

135.00 145.60 B: especially uh you know with the president being so you know the president of course is always uh [laughter] been the first person that's been aware of you know uh yeah keeping the press on his side 

145.69 155.97 B: and uh uh you know bush shouldn't be wouldn't be the first president in history who's probably uh wanted to keep unfavorable information out of the american public's 

156.19 159.63 B: view [laughter] 

156.30 157.25 A: [laughter] 

157.34 158.45 A: for sure 

158.57 159.72 A: definitely 

159.89 164.76 B: so i guess uh i guess in in that sense censorship is a pretty current issue 

165.04 172.59 B: as far as uh what do we show people and and do we just show everybody everything and let them sort it out for themselves 

168.06 168.96 A: yeah 

172.72 174.16 B: or uh 

174.94 176.15 B: (( you know )) 

176.10 181.25 A: i think the issue that they asked i think was more pertaining to schools though 

181.64 185.83 A: and when it comes to schools um 

184.58 185.27 B: (( i )) 

185.88 187.86 B: (( don't know )) 

186.50 194.09 A: i don't know i guess i have to i have to have a a for a for exist- or a for example type of thing i mean 

193.18 194.09 B: right 

194.21 195.47 A: i know 

195.79 198.41 A: they're free to teach darwinism 

198.49 199.31 B: right 

198.87 204.39 A: but but yet you try to teach uh uh christi- christianity 

204.54 206.97 A: and they're going to slap you on the wrist 

206.84 211.21 B: well i think it's it's not so much christianity it's more creationism 

211.39 213.50 A: well whatever yeah 

211.70 215.12 B: you know where where you know for example like with uh 

215.57 224.82 B: there's there's the theory of evolution and there's the fact of evolution you know they're still working on the theory of exactly how you know mankind came to be but you know [mn] 

224.62 233.48 B: as far as creationism that's that's definitely a pretty pretty you know fundamentalist and extreme viewpoint i'm not sure that uh 

232.38 234.30 A: i take it you're not a christian 

234.66 235.66 B: um 

235.80 241.29 B: i guess i was raised christian i was raised catholic um but i i do consider myself more of an atheist 

241.56 242.38 A: okay 

243.35 245.90 B: (( [noise] )) 

244.64 248.46 A: sad to say it's out there it all depends on what you uh what you believe 

248.51 255.71 B: [laughter] i guess it does yeah you see if you're not the i guess you do have to be careful what you're what you're teaching 

256.17 260.50 B: and what the what the foundation is and the basis of what you're teaching a 

260.54 272.97 B: a a belief system in faith um is important but there's so many different you know so many different versions of that you know every every every faith has their own faith 

260.69 261.73 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

273.00 276.80 A: yes exactly um 

275.39 277.73 B: are you a i i take it you're a christian 

277.73 278.61 A: yes 

279.33 280.26 A: yes 

280.73 292.76 B: so i i mean in regards to censorship say for example if censorship was in relation to say darwinism as you say um you just think it should be a two way street is that your main 

291.44 292.27 A: yeah 

292.38 295.75 A: i i say equal time that you know if they want to teach 

295.76 299.99 A: and and in some instances i don't think it's necessarily a bad thing 

300.09 301.72 A: um 

302.41 304.26 A: (( [mn] say uh [mn] )) 

304.63 309.46 A: a a very growing religion in america now is uh 

309.76 310.66 A: buddhism 

311.25 314.48 A: um i don't i don't agree with it 

311.42 313.59 B: yeah oh yeah 

314.50 317.19 A: but i i uh 

314.51 316.49 B: [laughter] 

317.22 320.31 B: (( oh )) 

317.22 322.00 A: i i feel it could be educational for those who do have faith in god 

322.14 325.70 A: to know more of what buddhism is all about 

326.02 334.77 B: sure and you know a- actually when you think about this there's far more you know i figure that you divide up the globe the actual global population there's far more buddhists 

326.88 327.97 A: (( and )) 

334.74 347.78 B: uh than there are christians if we're gonna start dividing up equal time yeah globally speaking yeah of course america is you know mostly christian but um yeah there's far more buddhists in the world than there are christians in the world 

338.01 339.89 A: globally yeah 

348.03 353.87 B: and if we're going to start devoting equal time to everybody you kind of have to give every equal time to everybody 

353.55 355.16 A: yeah and that's 

355.30 359.16 A: that's i i i i don't see a problem with that 

359.39 360.70 A: as long as it's 

361.29 363.96 A: dealt strictly on theory 

364.49 365.77 A: and not 

364.88 366.22 B: right 

365.88 367.28 A: personal beliefs 

367.58 372.78 B: right and i think uh society also has has a uh 

373.82 380.83 B: yeah has has a duty you know to raise itself in a way that's that's healthy you know so that that people aren't um 

380.95 387.75 B: you know fortified with information that they got from the schools you know turning around and uh turning into uh anarchists and uh 

387.69 400.18 B: you know causing mayhem and bombings and and that's you know part of my that's part of my concern about the slippery slope of some of the you know more extremist views from christianity there or any other religions certainly islamic has been uh 

391.07 392.16 A: mhm 

400.21 406.02 B: you know a hot topic these days is that you know ninety nine point nine percent of the islamics out there are 

406.24 420.23 B: regular people that want to raise their kids and you know have happy lives but then the other one percent that take it you know to the extreme are you know obsessive about it um become a problem to everybody else 

408.78 409.56 A: yeah 

410.23 411.04 A: right 

417.83 418.78 A: yeah 

420.05 423.74 A: and this this i say is no different than white supremacists 

423.62 424.97 B: (( [laughter] sure )) 

423.97 430.56 A: there are pe- there are a few whites that uh that you know that thinks they are they are it 

431.20 432.09 A: so 

431.90 440.77 B: i'm sorry i i had a little trouble hearing you i'm i am on a cellphone and unfortunately i'm at the beach so it's a little windy [laughter] let me see if i can turn my phone up here let me turn it up a little bit [noise]

442.22 444.64 B: there that might be better 

443.65 445.99 A: okay what beach you at 

446.37 448.36 B: i'm at uh venice beach

481.21 482.26 B: (( [laughter] a few people )) 

483.12 490.77 B: i think the temptation is to just start talking you know i the the to go off topic have we have we been on topic have we been good about being on topic 

490.45 492.88 A: we've been trying pretty well 

492.85 494.91 B: [laughter] 

494.02 498.94 A: i know my wife said she got a kind of got off a topic with her conversation at one time too 

499.24 500.97 A: um 

502.28 505.60 A: oh trying to think of anything else i was going to ask 

504.45 508.67 B: well censorship i i think is a is a tough one to really stay on topic with uh 

509.22 518.47 A: yeah i i was kind of hoping you was from pennsylvania because there is some state issues here that we could pertain to but uh i guess we won't need to worry about that 

518.89 523.80 B: oh in in regards to uh in regards to uh censorship 

519.93 520.86 A: (( well what )) 

521.58 522.73 A: well we 

523.15 531.52 A: well we have in pennsylvania it's not going through the house or anything yet but there's been talk of starting what they call a uh 

532.44 539.19 A: oh i can't remember just what they called it but basically what it was is where they give a taxpayers 

539.34 542.23 A: a uh voucher that's what they called it school voucher 

541.54 542.85 B: right uh-huh 

542.88 547.42 A: and then you take that voucher it's worth two thousand dollars 

547.46 548.27 B: uh-huh 

548.25 552.29 A: and you send it with your child to the school of your choice 

552.67 553.48 B: huh 

553.89 561.20 A: and there's been a lot of hubbub about whether it would include private schools mainly christian schools 

561.11 561.92 B: uh-huh 

561.85 566.02 A: and then if it did include that 

566.11 569.86 A: whether or not the state government could mandate 

570.17 581.46 A: what was taught in these private schools that they're using the public what they what they consider public funds which i look at it more of a private fund because i'm a taxpayer too 

574.24 576.29 B: right 

581.39 585.39 A: and if i want my kids to go to a private school i think i should have that option 

581.41 587.48 B: right sure absolutely 

586.01 589.01 A: whether it be a military or a christian regardless 

589.03 594.41 B: yeah i think yeah typ- typically you know private schools have been
