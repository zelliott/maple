18.47 19.54 B: brooklyn 

19.17 26.20 A: brooklyn okay so our topic is the right of public and private schools to limit reading is that the subject 

26.66 29.50 B: um if they have a right to 

29.65 32.88 B: take the um i mean to get the 

33.18 36.31 B: to [mn] limit reading yeah 

35.69 50.28 A: mm that's an interesting subject sounds like a little bit of censorship to me i guess it would depend on uh the content and uh the subject and the age group i think the times have to come where 

50.54 55.69 A: once children reach a certain age and grade then they could be exposed to a little bit more of the world 

55.78 63.43 A: even if they're not emotionally qualified for it because reading is what would make them emotionally qualified 

63.58 64.51 A: what do you 

65.63 67.63 B: well i think um 

68.76 70.56 B: i think that 

71.34 72.03 B: mm 

72.80 78.11 B: [lipsmack] well let's see well i'm i'm like a [mn] a s- a student um 

79.35 80.66 B: and 

80.96 82.65 B: during my years 

82.96 86.47 B: i mean during my years of school you know i guess both like 

87.26 91.48 B: books but only like during like the appropriate time 

91.95 95.89 B: there are like some things that i read ahead of time 

96.16 105.19 A: think uh-huh [noise] i i'm sorry please go on 'cause it sounds like the battery on my my hand phone was dr- was draining 

97.65 99.00 B: (( um hello )) 

99.78 101.21 B: oh yeah i heard something 

104.57 105.66 B: oh okay 

105.26 106.41 A: (( can you hear me clearly )) 

106.15 109.12 B: yeah um give me a second 

106.82 107.83 A: (( good )) 

109.90 112.04 A: and you were saying that you were 

111.35 113.25 B: yeah um 

113.85 120.43 B: yeah as to um i mean as time goes by i mean um there should be other 

120.67 129.96 B: there should be books that kids are reading but the problem i mean but maybe [mn] i mean there are some like subjects 

130.12 135.53 B: that are not th- they are not ready for certain grade levels like 

135.99 137.46 B: um 

138.23 141.87 B: i generally get any 

142.20 143.27 B: (( hm )) 

143.58 150.08 B: there's like sex education i got that when i was in sixth grade 

145.56 146.55 A: mhm 

149.54 151.49 A: right 

151.04 152.81 B: which i think was 

152.86 157.41 B: a little bit earlier than past generations 

157.44 159.62 A: okay well that's true 

160.08 166.05 A: uh my greatest concern is i'm a little bit more fearful of censors 

166.17 171.19 A: than uh having people just read what is available to them 

171.12 181.37 A: now public schools they have there own little libraries and of course uh they have the cross section of the appropriate literature and what not and there might be some topics 

174.70 175.63 B: yeah 

181.26 187.61 A: in there that might be a little bit sensitive but i would tend to trust the reader 

187.64 189.70 A: to use that information 

189.51 203.97 A: you have the librarian and you have the school teachers there plus parents who can help children assimilate what they have actually read if children read something and they have questions about things that disturb them about the material 

204.04 216.84 A: isn't that part of education and with the teachers there the librarian and of course parents who are involved in their children's education if they're there to guide them and to answer those questions 

216.62 229.23 A: i i would tend to trust that than someone in some room saying this material is acceptable this material isn't because then material will be limited to the feelings of a few 

229.26 241.08 A: instead of allowing the majority of civilization to look at something and to make a decision that seems a little bit more democratic to me and a lot safer than what censors have done in the past 

242.82 244.61 B: yeah um 

246.49 249.61 B: but also keep in mind that 

250.45 255.65 B: also keep in mind that w- w- well they're not saying what type of schools they're saying schools in general 

256.28 257.57 B: so 

258.16 259.66 B: the um 

259.97 266.95 B: [mn] there's some i mean private schools would act different from public schools and and vica versa 

267.27 269.79 B: also there's like um [mn] 

270.26 272.49 B: also it depends on 

273.06 274.46 B: where they're living 

274.69 281.32 B: i mean what state they're living in because all states are like i mean all states i'm sorry to say are all different 

274.70 277.13 A: well that's true i guess the local 

281.75 288.11 A: yeah that's true too so i would imagine the local school board or the local board of trustees 

287.94 300.97 A: of a particular private school will probably prescribe the content uh and and that would tend to be acceptable to me but to have the blanket statement that they should have the right to 

300.81 306.69 A: to limit what we read that terrifies me and immensely 

307.02 310.07 A: but that would tend to lend to excess 

310.05 323.47 A: excess in what is considered value to to civilization or not and i find that the greatest enemy to freedom than to allow individuals to make freedom of choice 

323.46 330.19 A: of what they would read or not an example if a parent really put values in their children 

330.09 338.76 A: uh they will tend to monitor themselves as to what they will feel is moral or immoral for them to read or what is considered uh 

336.01 336.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

338.61 350.98 A: really uh a hindrance or danger to society i suppose that someone on a school board based on their own experiences in life would judge that some material 

350.88 362.58 A: is acceptable or not acceptable i'm not against uh again having the right material available what i am against is a few deciding for the majority what should be available 

362.74 363.88 B: yeah 

364.38 365.82 B: um 

366.96 371.32 B: you know that don't that don't work either way from 

372.12 373.69 B: from um 

374.20 378.36 B: from schools to electoral college [laughter] 

378.41 379.64 A: and uh 

379.86 386.48 A: and that is my greatest fear i i know about the dangers of children getting a hold of material 

386.50 389.20 A: that may awaken in them certain 

389.31 399.90 A: certain behaviors or would provide them certain information that they will use incorrectly but those individuals can be helped 

390.67 391.64 B: mhm 

399.87 407.50 A: as opposed to just a few directing society in a direction that uh could be dangerous 

407.92 414.00 A: i trust humanity to do what's right i don't trust individual humans 

414.13 416.50 A: to tell us what is right 

418.89 422.79 B: hm well that's what it all comes to in the end [laughter] 

423.69 424.78 B: um 

423.73 428.19 A: and then on the flipside i i have two children myself 

427.53 428.56 B: mhm 

427.97 439.66 A: and there's some material i would prefer for them not to be aware of or view until they reach the emotional state that i think is necessary for them but then again as the parent 

439.58 446.14 A: i could guide that and if i develop enough of a relationship with my children uh 

446.30 449.27 A: i hope that they will accept my guidance 

449.96 450.97 A: but 

451.66 455.72 A: if i were to leave it to my daughter's third grade teacher 

455.52 468.59 A: and my son's fifth grade teacher to decide what they will read or not read then i sort of like feel that that position of authority's being usurped by someone else what my children may read or not read 

465.46 466.50 B: right 

469.25 473.93 A: and then plus they have to have respect for my children as individuals 

473.98 478.66 A: uh the feeling to decide for themselves what course they will take 

479.11 483.06 A: i would tend to trust that if we have a family relationship 

483.33 487.01 A: and if i help guide 'em to be responsible citizens 

487.23 492.68 A: that that would be the greatest safeguard as to how they will handle reading material 

494.86 499.73 A: but then i guess um society in general might be afraid that parents 

500.13 508.53 A: are not fulfilling their responsibility but that's the issue then that should be handled another way as opposed to censorship 

508.60 511.24 A: of school systems or 

511.26 515.67 A: [mn] private schools deciding what will be appropriate 

516.14 516.92 B: (( mm )) 

518.19 519.89 B: well it 

520.65 522.50 B: i know it takes um 

522.73 526.28 B: [cough] i know it takes a village to raise a kid 

526.43 535.11 B: um and some [cough] and in um some states and some 

535.36 538.37 B: i mean not in some states but 

538.70 540.21 B: the um 

540.82 545.22 B: it's very important for the parent to get like inv- involved with 

545.26 549.52 B: with with not only with not only the um life also 

549.55 552.11 B: (( the student's life also their )) 

552.17 556.84 B: son daughter's education as well i mean there might be 

556.88 571.12 B: i mean there might some [mn] ch- children that can grow i mean that grows up normally and and you know you can give 'em like normal stuff to read but then there's some student some some children who are like 

571.20 574.93 B: this age but they're acting like an age beyond 

575.27 580.09 B: you know they want or they are fast fast learners and they want to like 

580.27 584.25 B: ab- absorb things they want they absorb things more quickly 

584.36 585.22 A: that's true 

584.48 586.62 B: (( and )) 

586.59 593.30 A: and and there goes an acceptable role for our school administrators and educators 

592.70 594.41 B: mhm 

593.64 595.73 A: a role of mentoring 

595.84 599.89 A: a role of guiding exposing our children to uh
