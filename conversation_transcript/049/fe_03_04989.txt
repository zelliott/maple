4.29 8.76 A: hi um this is fabara hayes in um pasadena california 

8.18 9.43 B: hi how're you doing 

9.18 10.71 A: (( all right )) 

10.42 13.09 B: so uh you want to start or shall i 

12.22 13.32 A: sure 

13.27 14.47 B: okay go ahead 

14.27 21.32 A: yeah one of the things i find is that uh getting motivated to get out there and do it in in a timely fashion 

21.35 31.16 A: uh for walking and and keeping part of that uh positive mentality in regards and keeping up and all in balance it's all a balance situation 

31.12 32.25 B: mhm 

32.91 35.98 A: wouldn't you uh have that same kind of viewpoint [noise] [sigh] 

35.42 43.96 B: [lipsmack] yeah actually i just just recently in the last couple of years st- um started to get into fitness get into eating right 

43.81 54.63 B: and joined the gym and started doing yoga and really really got into it like in a way that i'd never i i'd never been in a gym really in my life you know with an exercise regimen 

54.74 67.38 B: so i got a trainer and i started working out three or four days a week and i got myself in the best shape of my life and it's you know feels great i mean it's it's like changed the way i look at everything now 

67.21 72.24 A: what you feel that you made an investment monetarily as well as emotionally and physically 

72.13 83.53 B: well i did make an investment monetarily it's funny you say that because i kept saying to everyone that i felt it was such a cheap investment to pay forty dollars a month to join a gym 

83.38 94.66 B: to prevent myself from you know weeks in the hospital or surgeries or you know any of the other complications that come from just being out of shape and unhealthy and overweight 

94.52 100.18 B: and i thought jeeze this is so cheap i i you know everybody should do this it's so affordable 

100.30 108.81 B: it seemed like uh uh the smallest price to pay for your health which when you don't have it you can't buy it regardless of how much money you have 

104.43 105.10 A: now 

108.30 117.82 A: now did you find out when you worked out did you work out at the same time every day or did you change the times depending on your schedule and did you do the same thing on the weekends 

117.10 119.87 B: i pretty much worked out the same time every day 

119.74 124.33 B: i would go uh in the evenings after work from like eight to ten in the evening 

124.18 132.28 B: sometimes in the weekend i would go in the mornings 'cause i wasn't working in the weekends but yeah i had a pretty regular routine and uh 

132.13 142.41 B: yeah i mean everyone at the gym came to know me and my husband and they would look for us so we had like a whole community around our new fit fit lives that we had never had before 

141.82 147.97 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] and did you do aerobics when you were doing that or did you just work on the machines how did you how did you go about that [noise] 

145.97 147.04 B: um 

146.99 160.58 B: i mostly did the machines and a lot of free weights uh and then as i got more and more into it i started with some classes i did step classes and my favorite was the cardio kick boxing which is a real intense workout 

158.03 159.61 A: [noise] [noise] wow 

159.96 161.34 A: yeah 

160.53 164.62 B: [laughter] and uh that that built up quite a sweat and that was pretty fun 

164.77 169.54 B: and then i got pregnant so i [laughter] so i pretty much slowed down on the exercising 

166.54 167.60 A: really 

168.54 174.37 A: so how long did you feel like it took you before you were comfortable in that environment to do that [noise] 

173.53 177.85 B: well let's see i guess in the beginning i was pretty shy 'cause i didn't 

177.70 189.89 B: compared to the big muscle guys i didn't know what i was doing i didn't know how to use the machines but my husband showed me how to use everything and it you know made me feel pr- comfortable pretty quickly i guess maybe after a month or two 

190.25 197.97 B: and you know like any other community that you become part of once you start going and you establish a presence there you feel comfortable there 

197.13 202.78 A: [noise] now did you go every day or did you go three times a week or five times a week how did you how did you schedule it 

202.32 211.29 B: like three or four times a week not every day because you can't your muscles get too fatigued and then you're not really building them up you're just breaking them down if you go every day 

207.11 208.95 A: mhm 

210.92 214.32 A: [noise] and those off days would you walk or would you just uh 

214.83 215.90 B: um 

214.88 217.97 A: just uh dull it back and not do anything 

217.25 225.74 B: what would i do no on the off days i would pretty much relax or i did take yoga at a not at the gym but at another place and i did that once a week 

223.99 224.88 A: mhm 

225.81 231.72 B: so i guess like maybe five days a week i was actually doing some serious activity 

230.26 237.71 A: yeah that's a pre- a pretty good commitment and what about from a yoga standpoint how long would that how much how long does a yoga session last 

236.96 239.10 B: the yoga class was for an hour 

239.81 251.59 B: and that was power yoga so you know there's there's all different kinds of yoga some are really relaxed you know for like older people or people who are a li- little less fit but the power yoga's pretty intense 

251.42 258.99 B: in fact one time i took a yoga class it's called bikram yoga and you do it in a room that's like a hundred and ten degrees 

259.05 265.88 B: so you're just drenched by the end of the class and it's really really intense but it feels great feels great 

264.50 271.81 A: [mn] [noise] [noise] and from a yoga standpoint had you ever taken yo- yoga had any kind of yoga before or did you just kind of just dive into it 

271.24 282.56 B: no i just dove into it and it was one of the first um steps into my new healthy regime um that i started and i loved it that's what kind of turned me on to the whole fitness thing 

282.59 292.02 B: and then i you know once i started the yoga and i saw okay i can do this then i joined the gym then i started losing weight so it kinda started the cycle in motion 

291.37 302.76 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] so do when you mentioned you started losing weight do you did you cook out i mean did you eat out a lot or were you a a person that cooked uh for yourself and your family or how did how did you do that 

302.14 316.10 B: um well yeah we used to eat out a lot uh we moved from the city to the suburbs so of course that helps you know when you're in the city there's all kind of fast food restaurants and really good ethnic food and when you move out to the suburbs there's a little less of that 

311.10 312.13 A: right 

315.81 319.31 A: what area are you are you in right now or you did you move from 

317.41 318.62 B: in new jersey 

318.86 321.31 B: we moved from new york to new jersey 

320.79 327.49 A: okay yeah i would imagine new york there's all i mean everything you could possibly want here in southern california you can get 

325.15 326.30 B: yeah there was 

327.50 330.55 A: pretty much anything you want delivered [laughter] 

329.64 334.09 B: right any time of day right up to until twelve midnight or two in the morning 

331.05 332.02 A: yes 

332.58 334.96 A: really pretty much so right 

334.18 340.01 B: yeah well that that's what new york is like so yeah the the possibilities are endless but when you're in the suburbs 

336.00 337.39 A: (( right [noise] )) 

339.90 353.33 B: you know you're more likely to go to the market and stock up your fridge with some good foods and cook and yeah i started cooking well we were grilling a lot of things out you know outside on the deck and yeah it's just a whole lifestyle change 

342.33 343.45 A: right 

348.54 349.54 A: (( [noise] right )) 

352.26 356.91 A: and did you find did you did you start drinking more water during that time 

356.26 358.83 B: oh yeah oh yeah i was drinking 

358.88 364.08 B: let's see the water bottles that were twenty four ounces i probably drank about six or eight of them a day 

363.59 366.02 A: [noise] wow that that's a lot 

365.05 372.55 B: yeah but uh you know that that's part of it all too you need to when you're sweating you're working out you have to get those fluids back in you 

369.94 371.64 A: mhm 

372.79 382.03 A: and did you find that when you did that did the people around you started changing too or did you they were more considerate of you or how did how did that that go 

381.60 388.22 B: yeah once people see that you're really serious about it then they start to kind of respect your 

388.06 398.08 B: your needs and all like i found when i was at my inlaws everybody they would kinda cater to me a little more they would put out healthier foods they would have salads they would have more fruit 

397.85 412.65 B: and then other people started eating that way and everyone started to feel a little bit better because it kind of it's contagious when you get you know when you're eating badly everyone around you kind of does it too if you want pizza and ice cream everyone's ready to eat pizza and ice cream 

410.39 413.34 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right right )) 

412.66 417.28 B: but if you want to eat healthy i think most people prefer to be healthy 

416.66 417.74 A: sure 

417.35 423.87 B: if given the choice but they don't necessarily have the right foods around or they right people around you know supporting them 

423.96 427.35 B: and once you create that environment i think it just spreads 

426.99 435.81 A: now did you find that you drank more uh diet sodas or did you drink more juices or did you you know not drink as much alcohol or wine or 

435.61 442.53 B: uh well i always drank diet soda my whole life so i continued doing that i did drink more water you know as i said before 

438.34 439.27 A: mhm 

442.32 446.86 B: and the juices i drank occasionally but they're really high in calories so 

445.73 446.71 A: (( [noise] right )) 

446.64 457.81 B: even though juice you know has is good for you it's got a lot of vitamins and all it's a calorie drain you don't get a lot of energy like you get from food but you still get those calories in you 

450.80 452.52 A: mhm 

457.66 458.83 A: (( [noise] right )) 

458.32 465.81 B: so i yeah i was you know re- kind of watched how much juice i would drink i'd have a half a glass of orange juice in the morning that was it 

465.54 471.90 A: mhm and what about from a alcohol standpoint did you continue or you're not a drinker yeah 

466.19 467.28 B: um 

468.97 477.97 B: i'm not a drinker really so yeah no i was lucky because a lot [laughter] a lot of people i know do like to drink and that is a huge calorie drain i mean that just 

472.85 474.49 A: right 

476.99 478.43 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

477.88 486.63 B: you're just drinking it and you don't get any nutrition out of it and yeah have plenty of friends who that that's a night out just drinking five beers or six beers 

486.05 487.00 A: right 

486.85 490.80 B: and uh i never had to worry about that so i guess i was lucky on that front so 

491.35 502.74 A: [mn] now did you find that uh did you eat more fresh fruit and more fresh uh vegetables is that harder did you use the the packaged um lettuce or did you uh [mn] 

502.84 510.61 A: i mean did that change did you go like for more of a health health store standpoint or did you just co- shop at your regular market [noise] [noise] [noise] 

509.97 517.58 B: yeah i i went to the regular supermarket but i would go to the fruit stands and i bought lots of fresh fruits and vegetables 

517.46 526.05 B: and like with every dinner i would have like at least two or three vegetable side dishes where before i may have had like a steak and 

525.83 533.84 B: you know a potato and then one green vegetable or something but i would try to fill up more on the vegetables than on the meat or on the pasta 

534.25 537.13 B: um yeah much healthier stuff 

537.39 540.95 B: and definitely more of the fresh than the frozen and the canned 

540.63 545.70 A: and did and did you find when you went to the grocery store if you went in the fr- uh frozen 

545.67 557.17 A: items would you buy more the healthy choice you know those kind of products did you look at that uh in case you wanted to have a a faster use use your microwave instead of cooking [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] 

556.54 561.35 B: yeah i did buy some of those healthy choice and and the weight watchers lunches 

561.23 572.27 B: um just for you know for lunchtime in the office if i didn't have time to prepare something i would have like a free at home i would have a few in the freezer so i knew i could always grab one in the morning 

572.14 582.00 B: and i would throw it in the freezer when i got to work so i didn't have to think about what i was going to eat and then you're less likely to cheat when you know you have something healthy waiting for you 

581.88 595.83 B: if there was no lunch waiting for me then i'd say oh let's go out and pick up lunch or go out to a restaurant you you know most people overeat when they go to restaurants restaurants just serve you know either two portions on a plate or a portion and a half 

595.70 599.56 B: it's not you know four ounces of meat it's eight ounces of meat
