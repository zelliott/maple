4.03 5.98 B: hi uh i'm james 

5.67 10.71 A: hi james i'm phil um i believe in the drug testing in the uh companies 

11.65 16.01 B: you you you don't think it's an like invasion of privacy 

15.75 17.08 A: no because 

17.86 19.60 A: and i get tired of dealing with 

19.67 25.55 A: you know in the hospital industry with all these ah waiters and waitresses that seem to always be on something 

26.62 40.53 B: yeah i can see that but i i don't know when i when i look at it i see it as like if if a person's not working up to par then then talk to them but i don't think that necessarily 

40.60 41.60 B: um 

41.66 42.55 A: (( all right )) 

41.68 44.34 B: drug testing is ap- appropriate 

43.74 48.23 A: well let me give you an ex- example yesterday okay i had to go to court you know for a case 

48.21 49.12 B: uh-huh 

48.38 59.65 A: and before my court case the judge uh was doing all these probation violation hearings and drug test failures and these are kids that had chances you know anywheres from 

55.57 56.47 B: uh-huh 

59.91 61.39 A: eighteen and up 

61.91 62.75 B: okay 

62.64 77.32 A: and there's supposed to be you know probation monitors and that spot checks them and they think it's a joke you know they say oh the judge is just gonna slap you know slap my wrists and send me back out on the street and sure enough they got a smart judge yesterday she uh committed a couple of them for uh 

77.52 80.96 A: you know for not doing what they were supposed to be doing 

81.02 91.73 A: you know so um yeah it it's one of those things and in in the work pale place they want the job bad enough then they'll adhere to the policies and the ones who are complaining are the ones that are doing 

91.78 93.81 B: tha- that's true that's true 

93.66 102.49 A: the ones who don't complain couldn't care less the only false readings you'll get is if you eat a poppy seed bagel because of the opium seeds you know on a poppy seed bagel 

103.32 108.53 A: or you know or a sandwich roll or anything like that so you don't eat those things that's all 

108.59 110.43 B: yeah exactly 

110.02 120.27 A: you know and you know plus there's different types of drug testing you can either do it you know through the urine or you can do it through uh you know the hair you know cutting a little bit of the hair 

120.37 124.75 B: oh yeah the hair you can detect like back a month or something right 

124.12 126.17 A: yeah exactly you know 

126.26 128.67 A: and some places require both 

129.07 131.03 A: just to double check to make sure 

131.64 135.58 A: and and uh especially in the hiring practise i think it's very important 

136.20 139.49 B: so have you had jobs that required drug testing 

139.23 140.23 A: yes 

140.49 141.31 B: wow 

142.14 143.66 B: i've never had a job 

143.81 146.10 B: that required drug testing ever 

145.14 147.74 A: well let me give you an let me give you an idea okay 

147.81 150.53 A: if you're gonna work for a company like hertz corporation 

150.54 151.89 A: or walmart 

152.52 155.24 A: you have to be drug tested that's their pol- 

154.34 155.24 B: really 

155.36 157.20 A: before you get hired 

157.01 158.34 B: funny 

159.31 164.94 B: i worked at uh at west point the military academy and we didn't even have to be drug tested there 

165.38 166.72 A: (( well )) 

167.61 176.49 B: and it's not like i'm i'm avoiding jobs that drug test i i'm not i couldn't care less but i just haven't had any jobs required it 

174.53 178.41 A: well all right what do you do what do you do for work besides work at west point 

178.34 182.54 B: well no i i used to work there i i work at harvard 

182.14 183.90 A: (( harvard university )) 

183.80 185.65 B: yeah 

184.79 192.95 A: all right well harvard university uh maybe they don't do it because they you know being a liberal school and an ivy league school and stuff like that but 

193.56 194.66 A: um 

194.85 200.35 A: like i said you work at the logan airport and those federal guys that had a you know that took over security 

200.03 202.90 B: oh shit they better not be doing drugs [laughter] 

202.15 204.21 A: they had to be drug tested 

203.65 205.67 B: oh hell yeah 

204.70 210.03 A: okay truck drivers under the d._o._t. standards every so often have to be drug tested 

211.15 213.22 B: yeah that that's appropriate too 

212.92 213.93 A: okay 

214.22 215.37 A: um 

216.36 220.81 A: some police departments require their officers to be drug tested especially if you're dealing with narcotics 

220.73 224.15 B: ah that that's like a given yeah 

223.53 225.76 A: all right so 

226.40 232.84 A: you know it it's like i said you know if you want the job bad enough then you know you'll do it and it'll keep you in check that's all 

232.76 235.37 B: yeah yeah now where where are you from 

235.31 236.61 A: massachusetts 

236.55 238.58 B: oh massachusetts also cool 

239.78 240.60 A: (( yeah )) 

240.05 242.28 B: normally end up talking to people that are 

242.71 244.52 B: from much further from here 

244.23 246.53 A: yeah do these people actually pay 

248.53 250.66 B: uh-huh oh yeah yeah they do pay 

250.54 252.89 A: okay good i wasn't sure 

251.88 253.73 B: this is your first time doing it 

253.53 254.55 A: yes 

254.37 258.88 B: okay yeah no i've done it before like it's been like a topic was like movies 

261.33 265.57 A: [noise] well that's good you know um the other thing is uh 

266.69 272.70 A: it's funny though you can't just walk in off the street and get your own drug test you you know you have to be referred by companies 

272.87 275.16 B: yeah that is weird 

276.39 281.94 A: and that's done for a reason you know something you can get your own drug test or you know like your mother can get it you know for you 

282.16 283.93 B: right 

282.98 286.26 A: but um you know but i mean 

286.28 290.03 A: you go in and say well here's my drug test results they won't accept it 

291.11 292.14 B: (( um )) 

291.20 292.04 A: because 

292.06 296.92 A: because there's temperature and chain of custody involved with it too when you do a urine test 

296.59 301.47 B: i've heard i've heard of schools having drug tests does that happen or 

300.36 302.86 A: yeah yeah it happens 

302.90 304.80 B: is it only for athletes or 

305.05 307.54 A: yeah athletes for taking the steroids 

307.59 312.95 A: uh you want to know how far it goes suffolk downs racehorses get drug tested after each race 

313.71 314.52 B: okay 

314.65 316.06 A: especially the winner 

317.00 329.24 B: no i guess i guess what what you said is exactly true i don't really give a shit because i'm not doing anything but i guess it is the people that are doing it that feel that it's a huge invasion of privacy 

328.67 330.35 A: right 

331.29 332.61 A: and um 

331.31 334.00 B: (( i find it funny that walmart though )) 

334.30 335.28 A: okay 

335.36 339.69 A: well think of it another way okay let's say they legalize pot all right 

339.05 340.08 B: right 

340.71 345.10 A: you know and you go to the local liquor store and you buy pot just like you buy beer 

344.28 345.30 B: ah [laughter] 

345.99 347.19 A: (( all right )) 

347.45 348.70 A: what's gonna happen 

350.24 354.62 A: in some cases not as many people will buy it because you know it'll come to them easy 

354.82 358.11 A: or secondly you're gonna have potaholics instead of alcoholics 

358.53 359.47 B: uh-huh 

360.98 362.23 A: you know so i mean 

362.45 364.89 A: potheads or whatever you want to call them you know 

366.15 368.88 A: but now look at tobacco okay 

369.18 375.36 A: under the tobacco laws now kids used to go in and buy you know sixteen used to buy uh cigarettes and stuff like that 

374.43 376.26 B: right 

375.43 379.32 A: okay now you you can't buy a cigarette unless you're over eighteen 

379.38 384.63 B: yeah but everyone smokes people start smoking at like fourteen years old 

384.56 388.02 A: right and what do you think why 

385.72 386.52 B: (( yeah )) 

388.11 396.30 A: uh you know like everybody's yelling in boston because they can't smoke in the buildings any more you know the restaurateurs and everything are yelling because they said they're all gonna go to cambridge you 

396.70 399.30 B: yeah it's true [laughter] 

399.55 401.38 B: everyone's going to cambridge now 

401.66 406.31 A: (( know yeah you know and harvard's a big university so if you work you know let's say in wormwood ave )) 

406.76 411.17 A: in boston and you want to go you know i mean you can go outside with a cigarette but let's say 

412.16 417.41 A: you watch how many will transfer to a place to other locations where they can smoke 

417.16 418.90 B: right 

418.64 421.90 A: you know if they if they're really a diehard smoker 

422.37 424.51 A: (( if not then you know who cares )) 

425.33 426.21 B: (( um )) 

426.26 438.20 B: uh about drug testing when they do it what what exactly is detected like i don't like there are people who are addicted to painkillers and stuff like that is that does that show up in results or not 

434.63 435.69 A: right 

437.30 441.24 A: it can so what they do is usually they ask a questionnaire what are you taking 

441.20 442.46 B: oh okay 

442.40 444.22 A: you know what is the doctor taking 

445.11 456.29 A: you know in case it in case it's questionable but it's a certain type of test that basically all it is is looking for cocaine and it's looking for you know like marijuana it's looking for a controlled substance 

445.29 446.18 B: (( okay )) 

447.52 448.43 B: right 

456.67 457.50 B: okay 

456.72 462.17 A: and they can pretty much you know and then they can tell more in a blood test than a urine test but basically you know 

462.33 470.08 A: if it comes out a po- a test positive then you got a problem and most of the controlled prescription drugs won't show up on your drug test either 

470.29 471.92 B: right 

471.20 473.87 A: so it's pretty much geared to the illegal drugs 

475.21 481.10 B: good well even though a a lot of people have problems with prescribed drugs 

475.35 476.94 A: you know as far as what 

477.12 478.67 A: chemical it's just 

480.55 481.76 A: right 

481.35 484.82 B: like vicodin and uh attarol and all that 

482.58 483.45 A: right 

483.91 494.18 A: right that's why like the companies always recommend not to tell your people that you're gonna have surprise drug testing and they always recommend don't eat anything with you know with an opium poppy seed 

484.93 486.39 B: (( oxycontin [mn] )) 

495.81 496.69 B: wow 

496.06 497.90 A: because it'll give a false reading 

497.76 501.42 B: the job you presently have has random drug tests or 

501.27 502.34 A: of course 

502.64 504.24 B: where who do you work for 

504.37 506.33 A: well i'd rather not say 'cause it's uh 

506.34 508.32 A: it's a security police agency 

508.33 509.69 B: oh okay okay 

511.55 516.92 B: okay then that makes sense that they would have random checks no i just work in an office so 

516.88 517.77 A: okay 

517.76 519.87 B: nothing like that 

520.05 521.26 A: (( all right )) 

521.30 522.17 A: so 

521.46 529.11 B: but it's funny alcohol can be as big of a problem as drugs can and that isn't measured 

527.41 528.20 A: (( right )) 

529.19 532.20 A: m._i._t. requires it in certain traumas that get hired 

532.37 533.33 B: really 

533.29 535.80 A: yeah from what i understand 

535.97 537.08 B: no shit 

538.98 541.84 B: they wha- what is the requirement 

541.43 545.02 A: well basically you know because they're dealing with government contracts and everything 

547.07 549.80 B: so they they can't drink or 

549.85 554.43 A: no it's not that they can't drink it's they can't use drugs 

554.29 560.49 B: oh okay but i'm saying alcohol can be as significant a problem as drugs can 

559.57 560.80 A: it can be 

561.85 565.24 B: and sometimes more so but we don't have any 

565.52 567.52 B: limits for that 

567.87 580.46 A: well random you see randoms the reason why they say ra- either everybody or random is that so that that's where you're really gonna target somebody but you don't want to target the person so you might have six people take a drug test all 

580.59 581.40 B: okay 

581.59 584.68 A: right and hopefully five are negative 

586.93 593.56 A: you know before you can target them but sometimes when you do random drug tests that's how you find out because people forget 

594.54 595.41 A: okay 

595.41 596.50 B: uh-huh 

596.49 599.90 A: and you know they can't flush toilets because usually the
