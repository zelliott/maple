0.00 2.48 B: hello this is joe in los angeles 

3.63 4.49 A: (( [mn] [cough] )) 

3.96 4.81 B: hello 

5.53 6.73 B: hello are you there 

7.44 8.47 A: hello 

8.05 10.34 B: hello this is joe in los angeles 

9.90 11.13 A: how do you do joe 

11.93 14.17 B: they where where you calling from 

13.52 16.69 A: [cough] uh south carolina 

16.12 29.93 B: oh okay uh i guess we're talking about censorship here uh whether or not uh they should allow in public and private schools i know where i live a lot of the private schools won't have certain books in their library because they think they're obscene 

30.39 41.54 B: um which you know i guess for maybe like uh you know younger school children i understand you really don't want some of those adult books in there you don't need to fill their mind with that kind of thing but uh 

41.81 47.07 B: you know i guess it depends on the grade level and the material i don't what what do how did how do you feel 

47.37 52.68 A: i think it should uh [cough] be restricted to some extent and it should be based on 

52.77 58.17 A: the maturity of the individuals that are expected to uh be exposed to the reading 

57.85 69.39 B: yeah yes the whole thing censorship uh you know it it's always somebody's opinion on what is correct for that age group and what is not and and everybody [laughter] has different opinions on that 

68.39 69.59 A: that's true 

69.37 74.83 B: so what is okay in one school might not you know the library at another school and at another school might 

74.75 85.40 B: feel it's inappropriate for the children there and uh you know and and it's hard to find guidelines on that i remember [mn] you know there was a big supreme court case on um what is obscene 

85.33 92.57 B: and one of the quotes from one of the supreme court judges is i can't [laughter] explain what is obscene but i know it i know obscenity when i see it 

92.62 93.70 A: (( oh yes )) 

92.75 105.99 B: [laughter] [laughter] so i you know it it's [mn] you know there there's uh it you really can't put guidelines down in writing what is appropriate i mean kids that are in fourth or fifth grade know everything about sex these days and 

105.28 106.96 A: well that's true [laughter] 

106.11 109.44 B: you know it it's all over on the internet but i mean it's still [mn] 

108.51 111.01 A: the internet and t._v. and everything else 

110.67 115.32 B: yeah but doesn't mean that their school has to put those steamy novels in their library 

113.72 114.81 A: well true 

114.88 117.51 A: no no that's absolutely correct 

117.80 122.64 A: uh they gonna have to make it more sensible than they already are [laughter] 

122.26 123.47 B: (( [laughter] yes )) 

122.99 125.90 A: i think there's enough material out there for them to 

126.34 128.23 A: well they're going to get it anyway 

128.45 131.11 A: uh unless there are some 

131.23 132.97 A: type of guidelines 

133.18 136.12 A: implemented to some extent 

135.41 142.63 B: now let me ask you this you know there's a lot of schools that like banned um like huck finn and and a few books like that because of the racial issues 

142.39 144.34 A: right 

142.93 144.83 B: how do you feel about that 

145.08 146.21 A: say it again 

145.79 148.84 B: uh the you know like uh the book huckleberry finn 

148.63 150.12 A: oh huckleberry finn 

148.88 156.57 B: and yeah and and a few other of the you know the the older books which are considered classics but there are some racial issues in there um 

155.11 156.24 A: oh yeah 

156.88 164.40 B: you know a a lot of schools have have banned that i know when i had to read those my teacher we went over the racial issues he you know and they said this is where 

164.22 178.21 B: you know there is this problem and this is how he's treating you know this person like this and and we went over that and we you know we learned from we learned from that that you know the bigotry in that book i mean we went over it and talked about it and discussed it uh i don't know what are your feelings on that 

173.69 174.60 A: right 

177.84 185.31 A: well uh i think uh bigotry and all these kinds of things that uh have been racial issues in the past 

185.41 190.56 A: have the attitudes have changed as a result of the uh way 

190.79 197.25 A: the population has gone and the way that uh [mn] well difference in population 

197.63 202.11 A: and the difference in people who are part of our even our 

202.73 208.41 A: american culture today ideas have changed a lot and of course 

208.42 210.89 A: it's just a matter of really 

211.32 219.95 A: an individual [mn] drawing conclusions about what that individual wants to believe and wants to 

220.94 222.23 A: to agree to 

222.29 225.26 B: of course and especially with kids i mean a lot of them 

224.05 231.34 A: and especially with the children that you are responsible for teaching or handling or disciplining 

231.47 236.42 B: yes and if the teacher presents the material in a way where kids can learn from it then 

236.45 241.87 B: you know especially i i don't see an issue [mn] even with you know some of the [mn] the older so called classics where 

241.21 244.73 A: well true i think classics 

241.96 248.56 B: where there are things that that today you know would be totally unacceptable back in the eighteen hundreds it was [mn] you know a normal occurrence 

248.77 251.01 A: you can learn from classics 

250.58 251.48 B: yes 

251.15 258.85 A: and the i think they need to know what was in the past i'm talking about the kids today you know 

259.25 266.07 A: and of course when you do uh expose them to that kind of information it helps them to 

266.40 269.33 A: gain a more complete knowledge of where 

269.52 272.35 A: their lives should be directed 

271.79 281.89 B: yes yeah it also helps them understand why people feel certain ways why you got the n. n. double a. c. p. and and what they're trying to strive for because they see how far they've gone you 

276.73 277.96 A: right 

284.77 294.40 B: know i i [mn] uh you know of course i i really i haven't had to deal with too many [mn] you know [laughter] racial problems against myself but uh you know i've i've 

291.64 293.62 A: mhm 

294.41 299.92 B: i'm in law enforcement i've i've worked in um areas that are predominantly in minority areas 

300.03 303.06 B: and uh you know i've i've seen how it affects people 

303.31 304.97 B: and uh you know of course 

305.00 309.97 B: it it's been a lot worse but it's still out there are many problems that still need to be overcome 

310.00 315.87 B: but i still feel that like the classics are a great way to learn how it was back in the eighteen hundreds 

316.16 321.12 B: and and some of the new stuff i'm trying to think of some of the new books that they've banned they've even banned um 

321.72 325.32 B: oh cough henry oh god 

325.87 330.90 B: oh jesus i i can't remember the name of the book but there's one book in particular 

331.00 338.24 B: um colden holden caulfield was the was the guy's name it's a very famous book uh it's the main character in the book and i 

338.27 339.72 B: catcher in the rye 

339.56 342.09 A: (( right mhm mm yeah )) 

340.16 341.84 B: do do have you read that book 

342.53 343.87 A: well you know 

344.60 350.09 A: [laughter] there are different views and of course how you read and what you read [mn] 

346.55 347.59 B: oh yes 

351.26 355.09 A: is [mn] to his own the individual interest 

355.67 365.53 A: and of course uh it has certain effects on the individuals who who do read the books that you are you know had reference too 

365.29 369.83 B: oh oh of course and if the teacher presents it in a in a fair and unambiguous way 

369.94 376.37 B: um i don't see a problem with it i i i think pub- or private schools have more leeway in in 

376.40 384.47 B: the material that they can present or that they want to present to their students especially there are a lot of schools with you know that are religious based schools 

384.14 385.29 A: (( mm mm )) 

384.52 388.29 B: and uh you know there is there's a lot of things that they really don't want to 

387.29 389.88 A: well true and of course [laughter] 

390.40 391.72 A: (( we are )) 

391.97 398.14 A: [mn] on the fence about what we actually feel like in the public school situation 

398.25 402.01 A: whether or not we should be even thinking about religion 

402.21 403.68 A: (( and what religious )) 

403.71 410.41 A: and how to present religion in schools or whether religion should be a part even of the thinking 

410.52 412.87 A: of the instructions 

412.71 419.37 B: yeah that's yeah because you know there's [laughter] so much of our country and so much of everything is based around religion it's very difficult to keep it out 

418.78 421.37 A: [laughter] i don't know how they [laughter] 

421.56 422.53 A: it's 

422.60 436.15 A: [mn] we claim that it is based on religion completely and then uh you know in certain instances we say no we don't want prayer we don't want you know this and that and the other 

437.43 438.58 A: [lipsmack] so it's 

438.89 445.00 B: [laughter] you know i [laughter] [mn] i guess if if somebody if there is a parent that feels strongly that 

444.91 454.39 B: his children shouldn't be exposed to certain books and a certain type of attitude then they if they can afford to send them to a publ- or a private school of course not everybody can afford to send their kids there 

452.06 453.85 A: yeah 

454.51 455.07 A: (( [mn] )) 

454.91 457.83 B: especially out here in los angeles it's very expensive 

457.31 460.00 A: (( yes [laughter] yeah i know )) 

458.46 461.22 B: [laughter] well it's very expensive everywhere i'm sure 

461.38 462.47 B: (( but uh )) 

462.79 464.23 B: [mn] you know i i 

462.92 467.80 A: yes education is qu- quite expensive in regardless of where you 

467.65 469.88 B: [mn] believe me i'm still paying mine off 

469.93 472.63 B: [laughter] that's why i'm making this phone call [laughter] 

471.62 473.90 A: are yeah i understand 

473.38 474.82 B: (( [laughter] )) 

474.14 475.14 A: okay 

475.07 477.53 B: but uh yeah i mean there's always a [sigh] [mn] 

477.89 485.51 B: you know if you present the if you present the material to the students especially if they're young kids with growing minds and you present it in the right way 

485.89 490.05 B: especially in a in a public school where it's taxpayer funds i i really 

490.03 490.90 B: uh 

490.88 492.76 B: [sigh] you know they [mn] 

492.55 493.88 A: mhm 

492.71 506.42 B: it's hard to say what is censorship i mean do do you want some some trashy sex novel in there for a sixth grader to read it it's yeah i don't i i think not putting them in a library i i wouldn't consider that censorship i'd just consider that commonsense 

498.54 499.94 A: [mn] 

506.47 508.60 A: i think a number of th- a number of a ins- 

508.85 517.08 A: number a number of things should be considered in even considering whether or not to censor or not to censor 

517.86 529.14 A: and that depends on a number of things in in connection with [mn] what the community what [noise] thoughts are in connection with the big place that you live in 

529.54 532.56 A: and the people and the surroundings 

532.69 534.55 A: in which you find yourself 

534.16 541.46 B: yes yeah you get to find out what the community wants community values and the community values are different they're probably a lot different where i live and when you where you live 

541.52 543.41 A: oh yeah 

542.41 549.68 B: um and and you're just thinking about it uh you know i i really enjoy history and i remember going reading a lot of the history books 

549.84 560.71 B: and there was the way they put things in the history books uh back in grade school and high school and and really reading reading uh deeper into it that's not really what happened they they 

560.09 562.06 A: mhm 

560.57 569.65 B: its almost like they censor what really happened to make it a nice glossy story to make make it like the americans are always doing the right thing and in effect we always haven't done the right thing 

569.92 570.89 A: no 

571.35 572.47 B: [laughter] 

571.39 576.04 A: [laughter] we do make mistakes and we are not perfect 

573.11 576.00 B: yes we've made more more than our share 

576.27 587.42 B: and uh you you know especially i remember reading a lot about the indian wars and and uh you know the americans we did some terrible things but uh [mn] the books that i read back in you know 

587.32 592.73 B: [mn] up through high school it didn't really say that it just s- said that they attacked our settlers and 

592.30 594.10 A: yes [laughter] 

593.08 595.89 B: and as yeah as we all know that's not what happened 

595.19 596.91 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

596.49 597.75 B: [laughter] 

597.01 599.89 A: (( we be getting to find a lot of books aren't ))
