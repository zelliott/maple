0.57 1.76 A: hello 

1.44 3.47 B: hello my name's bill daniels 

3.15 4.71 A: yeah hi i'm rick 

4.56 5.51 B: hi rick 

5.15 8.99 A: [mn] um did you hear ex- 'cause i know it was censorship in publ- [mn] 

9.02 10.52 A: did you hear the question 

10.51 18.10 B: yeah it it i think it was do you think that the public and private schools have the right to uh censor which books the students can read 

17.88 20.26 A: which kids can read 

19.64 20.54 B: yes 

20.63 21.95 A: oh okay 

21.84 25.50 B: or or or can- or cannot as the case may be i guess either way 

24.54 31.20 A: or can can or cannot read um okay uh do you want to go first 

26.75 27.48 B: (( right )) 

31.21 32.22 B: uh sure 

32.68 40.30 B: [mn] as far as uh censorship i i think that sometimes our our liberal people that are in in our school system are 

41.25 53.00 B: uh over bound to seem to to want to censor anything that's not in in agreement with their particular principles you know or their beliefs and i don't think that's necessarily right i think censorship uh is 

53.17 55.29 B: most of the time wrong uh 

55.32 59.91 B: uh depending on the age limit of course there are some things that are not appropriate but at a 

60.00 67.96 B: at a level where they uh can comprehend and understand and you know what they the book is about i think uh it has to be very little censorship 

68.45 79.82 A: right well i see i don't be- i don't believe it's the liberals that want to censor cens- [mn] are for censorship i think it's more conservatives right wing people that want censorship 

79.86 81.46 A: but um 

81.42 88.62 A: i think that in public schools i don't think there should be any kind of censorship 

88.50 96.97 A: uh 'cause um i think but then then you have the other side of the coin whether can the ku klux klan come in and bring their stuff in 

97.18 111.10 A: so and you don't want kids exposed to that you don't want so it's it's a real it's a very very touchy subject um i think that the school should uh have their curriculum 

111.18 118.09 A: [mn] depen- i mean and i'm talking about grade school now i'm not talking about college uh if curriculum um 

118.45 125.32 A: should be approved by whatever the uh the powers or be and and and uh 

125.61 127.15 A: that 

127.35 135.45 A: they should not i don't think they [mn] should censorship uh uh censor any kind of um 

135.73 145.36 A: i think i think the kids should learn [mn] everything about everything and let the censorship come from them whether they want to listen to it or they want to believe it or not 

145.26 159.36 A: um it's uh i mean it's it's such a deep subject i mean you could eith- it depends on how a s- a a subject is presented to you if it's presented with a bias towards it if it's presented without um i think that uh 

159.48 173.64 A: in this country especially with the the government that we have now we can just look forward to a lot more censorship and and what what they want [mn] us to hear because they're eroding our rights right now as we speak so um 

174.22 175.71 A: you know uh 

176.31 181.44 A: i i i don't i'm probably not for censorship if that's 

181.45 195.35 A: you know but i don't think i i think wh- when you say the li- liberals want to censor things i think you got that totally wrong i i think that [mn] the the uh word liberalism is in of itself um 

195.34 202.73 A: a freedom uh much more than what the right wing today is is moving in this country they're moving towards a very very 

202.54 210.72 A: uh one world government which is not going to be anything it wouldn't be anything but uh censorship free 

211.29 216.40 A: so um and as far as schools uh i mean i don't know where where do you live 

216.60 218.08 B: i live in south carolina 

217.83 220.49 A: oh okay well um 

220.12 222.18 B: you say oh okay what does that mean 

221.89 236.49 A: well i mean i'm just saying 'cause i i don't know what what you know your school system is like down there so i'm not quite sure what you know what what goes on down there so i can't really make any you know 

236.53 239.67 B: where you at new jersey you in new jersey somewhere in that area 

236.63 237.80 A: suggestions 

239.44 241.48 A: um i'm in new y- i'm in manhattan 

241.17 243.35 B: (( manhattan oh right downtown [mn] okay )) 

243.06 254.69 A: yeah so uh i just can speak for the school systems here um and [mn] it's always a a a fight to get something new into the schools 

243.43 245.37 B: right all right uh well [mn] 

254.77 261.20 A: uh introduced as far as books and uh you know new uh thought systems 

261.15 273.98 A: uh because there's always that core group of conservatives who are uh just want to like ban everything that doesn't agree with them and so this is i mean this is how i feel and this is what i've observed through 

273.87 276.76 A: through my own area um 

277.69 284.94 A: and um we're fortunate enough to live i'm fortunate enough anyway to live in a city that has that [mn] has made it's 

284.87 289.96 A: uh name in in expr- [mn] more or less freedom of expression so 

289.90 302.68 A: uh you know it's you know there's just a battle [mn] all the time with censorship i think that [mn] given uh the times we're moving towards i think we're going to see a lot more censorship than we are uh 

302.65 313.80 A: um freedom of expression i think what's going on now we're just [mn] you know our rights are being eroded left and right so um i would say that [mn] 

314.08 326.26 A: for me there's not that much room for censorship in schools given you're right given the age you know limit i mean you don't want five year olds learning uh certain things until they're able to uh 

326.18 330.73 A: choose for themselves that so um 

330.33 338.68 B: mhm mhm we're probably on the same track on at least some of this i don't believe that censorship is something that should be done i think it should be extremely limited if at all uh 

338.67 342.20 A: definitely but 

339.61 344.26 B: yeah it is something that you know i don't i don't think that uh one group of people should [mn] 

344.28 351.87 B: have the power to to arbitrarily pull a book out of a library for example because they don't like it you know a a school board somewhere i think that's some- something that uh 

352.32 358.98 B: and it should be if if if they want to do it they should recommend it to the parents and let the parents get together i mean that's what parent teacher associations are for right 

352.51 353.07 A: (( [mn] )) 

358.38 370.28 A: yeah well exactly i think uh what i think is censorship should belong in the home more than anywhere else uh especially in public schools because [mn] that's the whole idea of a public schools [mn] 

364.13 366.34 B: (( yeah yeah i agree with that )) 

370.12 378.71 A: you're being paid for it's being paid for by the people um i [mn] y- you know but th- then again i guess [mn] 

378.69 381.48 A: like i said if 

381.44 386.05 A: [mn] i can s- i can [mn] not that i can i agree with but i can see 

385.94 399.21 A: a s- the other side too where like like i said if you got um a ra- a very radical uh way of uh thinking uh or prejudiced way of thinking 

398.99 403.58 A: and uh you've got books in the schools or in the library say 

403.62 408.87 A: um do you want them to stay in there i think that that g- if 

408.94 410.58 A: given uh the way 

411.16 415.60 A: [mn] our constitution is they have to stay in there 

415.58 421.03 A: even though we don't like 'em or else that that in in of itself is a form of censorship 

420.87 431.66 A: i think that's what the a. c. l. u. is is does and it's not a very popular group i guess but um they're what they try to do is make sure that everything is there and available 

431.72 437.09 A: even though it's not the popular or uh you know uh mainstream view 

437.38 443.85 A: so we are agreeing that that i guess that you know it it especially in our libraries and our schools i think books 

437.50 438.14 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

443.97 449.14 A: should remain and no one should censor whatever's in there um 

449.40 459.24 B: what what would it take to have someone censor a book wh- in your eyes wh- what would it mean what kind of a what would have to be in the book or what would it have to be about for it be worth censoring 

459.40 465.52 A: [mn] what would be in a book to be censored well you mean up here or i- in general anywhere 

461.84 462.57 B: (( yeah )) 

464.58 465.85 B: any- anywhere 

465.70 467.09 A: anywhere 

465.96 468.02 B: (( [mn] yeah where in the united states )) 

467.12 471.79 A: well you know what that that's the whole thing if you got the religious right [mn] 

471.90 476.32 A: anything with sex in it is not going to be a they're going to want that out if 

475.35 484.83 B: let's talk about manhattan then what would it take in manhattan in in your your school district what would it take for you to censor something i'm not for censorship but i'm just curious what it would take for you to censor something 

484.72 487.95 A: for for [mn] well 

486.96 494.25 B: for you know if they give if they give you the book and said uh this is y- you know this is your choice if if if you say we're going to censor it we'll censor it what would it take 

494.44 495.45 B: what what 

494.56 497.33 A: you mean what kind of book would be censored here 

497.10 498.75 B: yeah what what would you censor 

498.63 510.34 A: what would i censor well i well like i just said i would hope that i wouldn't censor anything what i would like not to see in in public schools are [mn] are 

510.50 513.35 A: (( are say are [mn] )) 

513.49 519.23 A: a fundamentalist viewpoint of any kind of religion including christianity 

519.26 522.75 A: uh 'cause i don't think this country is about christianity 

522.78 529.57 A: um i would would not want anything anti black anti gay anti any kind of people 

529.60 536.25 A: that i wouldn't want to see but then again if someone's going to write a book like that 

536.14 543.34 A: [mn] you if if you're gonna have free ex- a f- a country of free expression who's to say that those things shouldn't be 

543.17 555.42 A: out in in public either so it's kind of like a double edged swo- sword but i would think that things that that make people's lives um 

555.86 557.28 A: uh uh 

557.38 571.18 A: [mn] make people live in danger or fear or any kind of thing like that would i would not want in my i wouldn't want my child to to learn about uh that i would want my child to uh [mn] 

571.29 583.52 A: to be uh a very tolerant person that that believes everyone has a right to exist uh and um that other people should not dictate other people's lifes 

583.65 597.39 A: in religion uh or sexual orientation color uh anything that's that's basically what i would anything that would hurt a person i think should be [mn] i i wouldn't like to see in schools 

597.59 598.67 A: um 

598.89 599.89 B: (( yeah [mn] well that that sounds ))
