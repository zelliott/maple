74.95 76.31 A: (( christian so i )) 

75.88 87.21 B: if there's can you hear me okay if if there's like a religion section in the library at the school and it's all you know different religions all different books there's no harm in people reading that

110.78 111.90 A: (( rye or )) 

111.22 117.35 B: oh okay yeah actually i don't even know if they were supposed okay i'm not sure if they were asking us about required reading um 

117.34 118.40 A: (( something like )) 

117.64 130.56 B: yeah i that that i can understand no- if you have a required reading list and it's and it goes against what someone else's religion is it doesn't make too much sense [mn] it actually would kind of confuse the person i think 

130.57 135.68 A: (( that have you ever heard like any any [mn] no that's um that's what i'm saying those kinds )) 

131.40 132.32 B: they sh-

138.95 140.43 A: (( i can understand it like if )) 

139.73 140.99 B: (( yeah )) 

140.72 141.61 A: (( if you're if )) 

141.55 142.58 B: (( i've )) 

143.31 144.72 B: (( yeah )) 

145.43 149.98 A: (( you're a mormon and you were told you had to read about catholics right )) 

149.74 152.85 B: (( i you )) 

156.66 157.60 A: right 

157.20 168.13 B: know but it's actually would be better was if they had you know maybe open group discussion about different religions if you're trying to teach people you know if you have a regular class 

168.10 175.16 B: everybody's learning about different religions there's nothing there's i don't think there's any harm in that there's no harm in being more knowledgeable 

175.15 176.72 A: (( right and i agree )) 

175.25 179.93 B: um but but if req- required reading um 

180.18 187.44 B: i [mn] i i couldn't even see a school making people read books like that if they had a different religion 

187.65 188.66 A: right because 

187.77 194.86 B: i would think they would wanna pick more more more novels or more type of you know like catcher in the rye or something you know with 

195.93 204.41 B: more you know more broad based but not religion books i don't think i never had to read any religion books and i was i went to a catholic high school 

204.36 205.66 A: oh really 

204.98 210.18 B: yeah the the required reading was more famous more novels 

210.08 210.96 A: uh-huh 

211.56 213.51 A: well like when did you [mn] oh well 

212.68 217.27 B: and actually they told us we could pick any five books we wanted 

217.52 220.78 A: i see i think things well when were you in high school 

217.57 219.22 B: ((  )) 

220.53 221.95 B: (( the set list wasn't there anything )) 

222.09 227.21 A: you see i [mn] i just i graduated in two thousand i'm in my senior year of college but 

226.69 227.96 B: (( else that you could have picked )) 

227.69 236.53 A: so then like i know you guys had like the choice like they had ah they have a set list for us they wanted us to read like and i i'm a hindu 

236.70 239.49 A: and so when i saw that i had to read the 

240.01 244.87 B: ((  )) 

245.40 246.41 A: (( ah the )) 

248.24 249.81 A: (( bible )) 

251.06 252.04 B: oh 

252.30 253.15 A: uh-huh 

252.99 259.55 B: yeah to me that that that see it's changed a lot to me that's too much that's going to the extreme 

259.51 260.36 A: uh-huh 

259.94 268.28 B: they ah it should be to make your reading [mn] more pleasurable and more enjoyable and then you know to get you more interested in reading 

268.32 271.85 B: i mean they should let you pick ah you know books of your own 

272.13 273.24 A: i agree 

272.56 281.64 B: you know or something like that i'm not even sure we might have had a list but i i mean we never had anything like that put on the list not back in not in my school 

279.59 280.41 A: uh-huh 

281.77 283.05 A: (( oh tell me )) 

281.78 286.74 B: that to me that's so you you had a choice and the bible was of 'em [laughter] 

286.84 293.96 A: right right right and i mean and i i read it and i mean i had no problem reading it i thought it was actually kind of interesting but it's no 

288.44 289.59 B: yeah i 

293.00 295.99 B: that's actually a very big book to read [laughter] 

295.93 300.68 A: i mean it was just like the first the genesis and exodus like the first two parts of it 

300.08 301.23 B: oh okay

309.21 310.19 A: (( so i )) 

311.75 314.85 B: i think they make things harder than what they really should be

326.79 331.53 A: (( is there ah [mn] is there a city called poughkeepsie is it around )) 

329.86 337.68 B: poughkeepsie ah i'm not sure where i've never been there yeah it's it's around here somewhere maybe it's two three hours away i'm not sure where

341.33 342.70 B: oh they have too 

342.18 344.66 A: i think [mn] they went for a wedding or something like that 

343.90 345.17 B: oh okay 

345.78 350.57 A: but um that's nice so how far away how far is rochester from new york city 

350.06 353.20 B: oh eight hours away thank goodness [laughter] 

351.89 354.64 A: oh is it it's upstate right 

353.90 362.55 B: yeah i'm up- and it's more down towards the yeah um center yeah i i'm like eight hours away i'm not that close at all 

357.97 358.83 A: (( i see )) 

362.56 365.67 A: okay so during like nine eleven you weren't affected 

365.08 368.54 B: no no not no we were way too far 

368.51 370.06 A: okay well that's good that's 

369.43 370.87 B: yeah [laughter] 

370.90 374.73 A: did you hear about they had a i think there was a body at yale 

375.90 379.55 A: is where where is yale i'm not even sure where yale's located 

378.84 382.08 B: yale it's not i'm not exactly sure either 

381.73 384.08 A: [mn] oh okay i thought maybe it might be in new york 

383.95 385.43 B: i don't think so 

385.25 386.26 A: (( okay )) 

385.60 386.32 B: (( [laughter] )) 

386.47 392.05 A: yeah the bottom line like i guess [mn] i think they should do it the way you said like they should have a maybe 

391.38 398.59 B: yeah they might've changed it seems like they might've changed things and they probably going to the extreme 

395.74 396.55 A: (( ah )) 

398.66 401.11 A: (( right [noise] )) 

400.37 409.44 B: they should have more you know more novels you know like catcher in the rye or moby dick or something you now more of the classics or 

406.02 408.08 A: yeah moby dick was another 

409.40 423.40 B: you know i i they don't need to mix a religion like that because that's you know that can be left to classroom ex- you know explanations and classroom discussion it doesn't have to be i don't think they have to put that on [mn] on a list 

414.89 415.68 A: (( one )) 

423.41 432.59 A: i think the system that you described the one that you had in your high school was probably the best one that's the pick like five books of his choice to read 

427.70 428.74 B: yeah 

431.99 443.86 B: i think that's what it was there might have been a list but it might've been a very long list but i know as far as i remember yeah there might have been a list but basically it was they were all great novels i mean it was easy to pick 

443.86 445.06 A: right right 

444.21 450.70 B: i [mn] well i never saw any religion books whatsoever and i went to a catholic school so 

451.50 460.97 B: kind of things things have changed i i don't necessarily agree with what they're doing if they're putting the bible on there i should they shouldn't have to have people reading the bible i mean if they don't 

461.51 465.78 B: if their religion is not you know not part of it there's no sense to 

466.35 474.68 A: yeah i agr- well i mean that was my freshman year so i don't know if they've changed anything but um i mean i'm sure they have i'm sure someone said something about it 

474.82 480.66 A: (( but i think the be- like what you said the best thing should be like a list of books that the kid can choose and um )) 

481.08 484.74 A: then i mean that way they get their choice they get their freedom of choice or whatever 

481.19 482.06 B: (( yeah )) 

484.42 486.32 B: that's true yeah 

486.71 487.81 B: well they 

486.97 489.69 A: (( so have you pardon go ahead )) 

488.88 494.97 B: that's all right i was gonna say they they do a lot of ah i guess i don't know i i didn't know they even did that 

495.58 499.05 B: and they and you said you had the bible as one of the choices 

498.77 500.22 A: yeah yeah i was 

499.34 502.91 B: was there any other religion books on your on the list when you saw that 

502.00 504.24 A: no no no that was that was the only one actually 

503.95 505.77 B: that's kind of strange 

506.29 507.72 A: (( yeah but it was )) 

508.14 511.61 A: um how did you hear about this ah study 

511.03 519.74 B: oh i got something on my email i was trying i'm actually trying to find more like this i think it was on my email i just kind of signed up
