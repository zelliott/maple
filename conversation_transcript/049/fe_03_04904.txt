0.40 2.87 A: hello this is joe in los angeles 

2.97 5.66 B: hi this is esther from rhode island 

4.96 6.54 A: how are you today 

6.11 7.42 B: i'm fine thank you 

7.17 13.39 A: ah i get drug tested quite a bit i work uh in law enforcement and um 

13.48 20.64 A: it they can drug test us for two reasons they can drug test us for cause but then there's also random drug tests kinda keep everybody on their toes 

20.64 25.30 A: uh in my line of work i i think it's well worth it because uh 

25.30 36.85 A: you know we are in a lot of pressure situations especially shootings and fights and and things like that and if there is somebody that is on something that's affecting them or it turns out that somebody is using drugs 

36.73 41.19 A: that opens everybody up for a law suit and also could you know mean my life 

43.77 44.66 A: (( are you there )) 

44.28 45.99 B: yes i am i'm listening to you 

45.59 56.93 A: oh okay um and you know there's also drug testing for other companies you know first you know pilots and stuff like that anybody that's involved with uh safety of other people i i think um 

56.89 70.80 A: you know mandatory drug testing uh i know flight attendants get random drug tests and there's also for cause drug testing if their their supervisor that feels like they're acting inappropriate and uh they think they might be on something they drug test a lot 

70.62 72.51 A: um companies 

72.74 78.08 A: i don't know in in a regular company that's not involved in either national security issues or firearms or 

77.97 92.93 A: or something maybe you know computer processing where there's not secrets involved you know i i random drug testing i think might be uh kind of an invasion of somebody's privacy but for cause drug testing or probable cause drug testing i don't consider it uh what's your opinion on that 

92.36 94.33 B: well i work in an office and i 

94.51 100.43 B: i don't think they should do it in an office because we don't have we don't really take care of anybody's you know lives or anything 

100.43 101.20 A: yes 

100.56 102.80 B: i work in office for purchasing and i mean 

103.00 112.32 B: if i worked at like you did i would feel like i would need it too because obviously if you're a policeman or something you don't want somebody else to be drugged up or something and being responsible for the other half of your life 

111.70 116.53 A: of course how can we arrest people for using them and selling them and we go home and do them ourselves it's terrible 

115.86 121.43 B: well i've some d._e._a. agents when i was in florida and i'll tell you half those guys are so messed up it was a shame 

121.08 122.61 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

122.01 129.07 B: and you know they were taking because i seen one of the guys and i'm like wow these guys are really messed up how can they arrest these people when they're just as nutty as them 

128.78 133.53 A: yes you know when you're involved in that lifestyle it it it affects people it really does 

132.50 133.79 B: (( yeah )) 

133.63 142.10 A: um you know with uh i've got uh a human resources degree and a lot of uh classes i mean we we always used to talk about this issue about the drug testing issue 

142.41 150.17 A: and most companies i'm out in california i would i would say probably about seventy per cent of the country drug tests preemployment drug test screening 

150.66 163.85 A: and uh and the majority of the companies that i know any company that gets some type of federal contracts or state contracts they have to do some type of drug testing usually it's a a for cause they're not gonna you know 

157.17 157.99 B: mhm 

163.95 168.75 A: haul the pull the old woman you know the sixty year old lady from behind her desk and force her to take a drug test 

167.78 172.49 B: oh yes i know they're trying to get it enforced where i am now for the truck drivers and everything 

172.44 173.25 A: yes 

172.53 177.28 B: and they they're kinda like in the middle they're back and forth they haven't passed it yet but they are trying 

177.15 188.07 A: you know in in something like that i'm sure you know insurance is a big cost for the truck drivers and and i'm sure the insurance company if if they knew that people were getting drug tested random you know 

182.96 183.86 B: mm 

187.84 198.94 A: at least random drug testing i'm sure that might lower the insurance if i was an insurance company and i knew that you know this company was testing their their truck drivers for a drug uh i'd probably give them a little break 

198.43 202.73 B: well it could help because rhode island and boston insurance is so bad it's terrible out here 

202.48 203.84 A: oh yeah 

203.30 211.08 B: i mean my sister lives out in seattle and she has less she pays less for her insurance for three vehicles and when we pay for ours for two of them 

211.10 216.82 A: god it yeah yeah it it's uh it's quite different on the coast um 

217.04 219.62 A: but you know in something like a truck driver too i mean that's 

219.82 225.94 A: a truck is a big huge thing and they could really hurt a lot of people especially if somebody's not paying full attention behind the wheel 

224.92 229.36 B: oh i agree with you yeah because we have big semis and everything and they should be i i agree 

229.14 239.55 A: yes and then uh you know in your office i mean if somebody came in and acted really weird you know staring at the lights and saying oh wow look at all the pretty colors now wouldn't you kind of 

239.86 244.23 A: want to say listen i really don't want to work with this guy there's something wrong and maybe 

244.16 256.71 A: you know if you felt that he was doing drugs or there was a serious drug problem uh i mean i mean would you want that person to be tested so they could find out if at least there was a problem maybe at least try to get him help not nec- not necessarily fire him 

255.68 260.74 B: oh yes well we had a girl in the back con- she was a controller and we also was wondering what she was doing 

260.84 263.37 B: but she was drinking and i'm like geeze 

263.61 271.96 A: that that is one problem you know they've got alcohol which stays in your system i mean i think they can test for it for about eight or nine hours 

272.02 275.74 A: um our thing is we're not allowed to drink eight hours before work 

275.51 276.63 B: oh okay 

276.39 290.09 A: and uh that's how most most they feel like uh your pilots and stuff like that they're not allowed to drink uh there's a certain time schedule you know eight hours before work they feel is enough and even then you're not supposed to be drinking heavily um most people i know 

287.95 289.06 B: mhm 

290.03 299.44 A: if if you know they're gonna be working the next day they don't drink at all nothing with alcohol even you know the the cough medications or or um or cold or flu syrups 

298.79 300.14 B: oh right 

300.46 309.59 A: uh you know with us we we have every time we are on a medication we have to call we have to get it okayed by our doc- you know by the by our agency doctor 

309.56 310.67 B: oh 

310.56 311.67 A: and uh 

312.18 321.28 A: you know i mean i i i used to do a lot of studies in drug tests and there are lots of crossover drugs like some type of you know cold and flu medicines that if you are tested it will test positive for 

320.63 322.11 B: mhm 

321.29 328.83 A: or either methamphetamines or opiates or something like that and then again there's still there's a lot of uh new drugs um 

328.87 337.59 A: you know g._h._b. which is very difficult to test for uh there's steroids which is a drug which are is a very expensive test which most agencies don't test for 

337.68 343.85 A: um there's not really clear policies laid out normally they just test for like marijuana and opiates and and amphetamines 

345.51 351.18 A: and even diet pills contain you know something and are lots of times what's considered a a crossover reaction for amphetamine 

350.25 351.80 B: mhm 

352.31 361.19 A: so it's it's it is very touchy and a lot of it depends on what type of drug testing they use if they use a cheap drug test i mean poppy seeds might show up on that 

360.63 361.22 B: (( mm )) 

361.29 362.37 A: (( so [laughter] )) 

362.14 363.10 B: yeah that's 

363.78 366.35 B: i can see a lot of people getting mad over that 

366.13 367.66 A: yeah i know um 

367.77 376.15 A: you know i i work with the federal government and a lot of times they have uh people who are on probation they have them come in and give them a uh what uh a drug test it's um 

376.13 388.86 A: something where they do it right there in the office and they put it in a little tube and shake it up and it'll change colors if the person's on drugs or if they if there is some type of drug residue in the system and then if that is positive they send the test out to uh a lab for a more 

388.71 403.14 A: specific test and and a better test um which is maybe something that they could do in the offices but then again you know it's only as good as the supervisor that's doing the test and especially if there is a supervisor i don't know if you've ever had a problem with a supervisor i'm sure almost everybody has 

403.38 410.01 A: if the supervisor doesn't like you then they they try to get you to take this test and it i don't know it just makes you look bad even if you come up negative 

409.45 410.37 B: mhm 

411.36 419.67 A: or you know a company's got to have a very specific policy and it does open a company up for law suits when they when they test somebody for you know a for cause 

420.27 425.97 A: um there was a a guy that i used to work with and there were a lot of supervisors didn't like him and they they 

426.05 430.61 A: said one supervisor said he was acting a little strange and they made him take a drug test and he came up negative 

430.77 436.97 A: but uh he actually sued and won about fifty thousand dollars it was be- harassed 

434.41 435.58 B: wow 

438.03 441.52 A: so i you know especially in a company like yours how big is your company 

440.91 442.54 B: it's only twenty people 

442.70 444.74 A: yeah ah you know if if there was 

444.78 449.71 A: a problem where where they had somebody take a drug test of course in a company that small everybody's gonna know 

449.62 452.34 B: mm oh everybody knows everybody's business where i work 

451.91 453.32 A: (( yeah you know that's )) 

452.44 455.10 B: you can't do anything without somebody knowing what you did 

454.77 465.01 A: of course and that's that's an embarrassment somebody like i mean i'm sure you take a lot of pride in your work well if if a supervisor thought or somebody thought that you were on drugs i mean wouldn't you consider that a slap in the face 

456.84 457.67 B: mm 

464.49 474.75 B: well we got a supervisor who was on drugs i mean it was even worse we really couldn't say anything 'cause they were like bombed off the wall oh it was terrible it was a controller and it was really sad 

467.57 468.44 A: yeah 

470.44 471.49 A: oh god 

473.93 475.61 A: and it it was all alcohol 

475.47 481.05 B: um we think it was a little more than that but we're not sure we saw the bottle in her pocket book one day and 

481.05 482.30 A: what happened with that 

481.10 486.30 B: she she cracked up two of the cars within two years she smacked up a beamer and then a land rover so 

485.99 488.25 A: oh and wha- and what happened with that person 

488.07 490.67 B: um at the moment they finally left 

491.41 493.18 A: they left on their own free will 

492.51 501.38 B: well it was kinda complicated they were involved with the boss and it was a big mess and you kinda find out at the end i mean they they really should have been in jail a long time ago 

496.43 497.58 A: [laughter] 

501.78 502.98 A: yeah 

502.33 504.44 B: too bad some people get away with murder 

504.06 506.60 A: do they have an alcohol policy at your work 

506.44 514.90 B: well we it's just commonsense i mean none of us drink at work we know you're not supposed to drink you have to work with customers and we're doing numbers all day and you don't want to make a fifty thousand dollar mistake 

514.49 520.09 A: but do they do they having something in writing saying you have to have like point less than point zero zero one 

518.74 525.28 B: no we have nothing it's a very small company you don't really fill anything out you just do your insurance papers and you really don't fill anything 

525.00 529.07 A: oh uh i mean do you have anybody that does like human resources pay roll or is that 

528.66 533.20 B: um well i been doing the pay roll but the other girl does human resources and we really don't have anything 

533.28 539.06 A: you know the human resource woman should get something together and maybe you start doing some research on 

538.93 550.17 A: on plans and just put in a policy especially for the truck drivers you know no alcohol drinking between you know eight hours before you have to have it less than point zero zero three or point zero zero one for an alcohol 

542.17 543.09 B: mm 

550.27 556.27 A: to to work and if you have more it's not that they're gonna fire you but they will put something in your file and you will not be able to drive 

556.25 558.08 B: yeah 

557.22 565.07 A: and uh you know it's it's and and she should look with the insurance companies usually have a lot of stuff on that and it might help lower the insurance 

564.98 570.15 B: yeah i know i'd like to lower my insurance and i've never had an accident or anything it's just so high out here 

569.79 575.97 A: [laughter] oh i i know i've just i just got another car and my insurance is pretty high too and and i'm a cop so [laughter]
