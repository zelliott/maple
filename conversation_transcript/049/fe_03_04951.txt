31.32 32.62 B: [laughter] 

34.74 37.56 B: and and it's something about the ah ah 

37.71 43.62 B: should ah public and private schools subject s- students to reading certain books is that what i heard right 

38.98 40.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

43.07 44.66 A: something to that effect 

44.05 52.86 B: yeah i mean i myself you know i wasn't a big reader and i regret that now because you know of course i do more reading than i i did when i was younger 

51.57 52.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

53.33 55.06 A: (( [noise] )) 

53.36 54.47 B: so 

54.81 59.27 B: um the little bit of reading that i did do in high school ah you know no- 

57.50 59.87 A: [noise] [noise] yeah 

59.64 64.42 B: nothing major none of the classics but i'm glad that ah the teachers were allowed to 

63.41 65.63 A: (( [noise] right )) 

65.01 73.62 B: so i'm not sure that i'm i think that ah there's any bad books out there that ah shouldn't be read by high school students or you know whatever school students 

75.23 81.35 A: okay i think i pretty much agree with you i mean ah kind of ah the opposite of you in that i 

81.35 95.76 A: read voraciously i have always read voraciously i currently own probably upwards of [noise] two [noise] hundred [noise] books that just sit on my shelves 'cause i haven't gotten to them yet even though i'm [noise] still constantly [noise] reading [noise] 

85.20 86.53 B: oh you're like my wife 

92.67 93.57 B: right 

96.12 97.92 A: so it's m- 

97.21 98.73 B: well good 

98.16 104.00 A: stay inside that's my dog i got so much going on in my house you can't even fathom it um 

100.10 101.25 B: [laughter] 

102.73 103.69 B: [laughter] 

104.64 110.89 A: but um but yeah i um i guess i believe in obviously reading [noise] without end 

111.09 118.78 A: as to whether you know a school has the right to well i mean a school has to choose what it teaches you know what i mean 

118.32 119.69 B: yeah exactly 

119.52 122.11 A: but you know [mn] 

122.74 127.01 A: i guess i guess i'm really trying to understand the topic a little bit more 

126.30 135.23 B: yeah i don't i mean they could've they could've made it a little more clear i mean [laughter] you know they've made it sound horrible does it a school have the right to make somebody read i think that's their job right [laughter] 

129.36 130.95 A: yeah 

134.48 140.23 A: [laughter] yeah but i think it was also trying to get to the idea of [noise] do they have a right to 

140.16 153.47 A: impose particular um books upon kids and i guess that you know i think the rule was where i always grew up was that one had to read what one was instructed to read 

153.35 158.21 A: and if not the parent had to provide a [noise] suitable alternative 

157.59 158.86 B: yeah there you go 

158.99 165.66 A: you know so i mean [noise] you can't cop out and [noise] just not read because [noise] you know 

165.81 173.63 A: parents decide that they don't want their kid to read a particular thing you gotta you know something in there yeah exactly gotta read something 

169.79 171.33 B: you have to read something 

171.86 182.39 B: yeah i mean you you have yeah you have to you know prove that you can you can read a text and and answer certain you know quest- questions that are applicable to that story so 

173.76 174.95 A: [noise] 

178.68 186.94 A: [noise] [noise] right right i agree hopefully my phone won't fade out here [noise] i'm actually outside my house now 

186.69 187.57 B: ah 

187.22 195.59 A: has a pretty good range but we shall see [noise] so [noise] you still there oh okay good [noise] so [noise] [noise] 

191.81 192.74 B: yes sir 

193.94 204.22 B: yeah i i myself think that ah i i don't know in in schools you know it'd be that you just like ah libraries i wouldn't want a library not to carry a book because it offended somebody else 

202.19 203.05 A: [noise] 

203.97 205.79 A: right exactly [noise] 

204.54 209.44 B: you know i mean th- all they have a choice they can not read it just like in schools you said you know okay if you 

209.49 223.37 B: absolutely can't read it which i can't understand i've read you know plenty of books in high school that i didn't like and plenty that i did like that somebody else didn't like but they read it just like i did so you just read it take the test and don't recommend it to somebody else 

211.28 212.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

215.70 217.25 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

219.65 221.43 A: right 

223.10 225.99 A: right now there's all the harry potter controversy though 

225.69 227.21 B: yeah yeah 

226.15 231.21 A: this might be speaking to some of that but i think that's all lunacy personally [laughter] 

228.44 229.45 B: (( ah what )) 

230.33 239.36 B: well yeah i mean i i myself i i don't care my wife she's not a big fan of the the harry potter stuff either but you know i mean she's not you know burning books and and ah 

238.38 240.65 A: [laughter] 

239.29 246.51 B: you know she's not trying to get rid of the local congressman or anything like that she just doesn't [noise] doesn't really care for the harry potter stuff 

243.54 245.29 A: mhm 

246.19 247.70 A: right 

247.01 250.18 B: i i i'm neither way i i could care less [laughter] 

251.57 252.58 A: so 

252.39 255.67 B: [noise] so do you have an opinion on the harry potter stuff i mean 

255.09 260.26 A: i'm actually very into that genre of reading 

259.67 260.71 B: (( oh okay )) 

260.36 265.65 A: science fiction and fantasy is almost all i read um i shouldn't say that totally though 

263.01 264.56 B: oh so okay 

265.13 266.41 B: yeah yeah 

265.78 274.08 A: that's what i mostly read but i actually read just about anything i can get my hands on that's halfway decently written and even some things that aren't decently written 

273.60 279.49 B: right well yeah i i actually just got my wife to ah finish reading ah tolkien for the first time so 

278.88 288.37 A: oh really see and my wife is in the middle of it i actually believe it or not despite my enthusiasm for the genre have not actually read the ah lord of the ring series 

279.53 280.49 B: yeah 

287.93 289.50 B: oh okay well you 

288.66 294.65 A: which is pretty pathetic but i do read and am reading robert jordan's ah wheel of time 

294.52 295.74 B: heard of it 

295.29 301.04 A: are you for you i mean if you're into fantasy you should definitely pick up the first book it's ah 

301.29 308.07 A: yeah i think i think it's just called the wheel of time no the first book is called the eye of the world and it is ah 

306.62 307.84 B: (( eye of the world )) 

307.95 317.79 A: probably the best modern fantasy series you'd ever have the opportunity to read i wholeheartedly recommend it but actually right now personally i am in the middle of um 

311.51 312.41 B: okay 

317.63 323.20 A: what's his name i forget his name but he it's the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy series 

322.77 327.37 B: oh yeah yeah yeah yeah gotcha i don't know his name either but i know exactly what you're talking about 

324.83 325.67 A: so 

327.14 332.82 A: so i just finished actually the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and now i'm reading the restaurant at the end of the universe 

332.93 336.55 A: so which is the second book in the series so 

333.07 333.96 B: (( yeah )) 

335.30 336.17 B: okay 

337.30 338.44 A: but um 

338.49 343.02 A: i don't know how much we're supposed to stay on topic i feel guilty [laughter] 

341.17 345.65 B: [laughter] yeah i'm i don't know either i'm not sure that ah 

345.47 350.96 A: especially since we have the same opinion [laughter] it's really difficult to keep coming up with things to say 

347.47 349.17 B: well yeah exa- i mean 

350.27 357.10 B: yeah okay ah i think kids should read and ah even if they don't like that book read something else okay you can only say it s- 

355.12 360.72 A: right i mean i i mean i guess the only thing ah that would really come as important to me is you know 

360.66 370.86 A: and i'm no educator but you know the age at which your children is supposed to be required to read a particular thing i mean i could see some contention there you know 

361.95 363.83 B: right well i'm trying to be 

370.48 371.44 B: yeah 

370.99 379.95 A: 'cause in my kids in my kids in my opinion kids and i think in largely in opinion you know they need in order to understand something fully they need something concrete you know 

379.77 387.38 A: so if you thrust harry potter in front of you know an eight year old that's all well and good but they still have to know that it's like fake 

386.98 388.61 B: fake yeah exactly 

387.83 392.31 A: you know so [noise] but um 

389.39 391.10 B: it's a story [laughter] 

392.60 401.91 A: you know so it's gotta be not not just read but explained you know and you're certainly not gonna give you know a young kid a book like oh gosh i [noise] don't know 

402.59 403.63 A: um 

404.02 408.35 B: well just about anything i mean you look at ah huck finn he was a little trouble maker 

408.11 410.34 A: right right 

408.42 412.12 B: you know what i mean he ah it depends on the child [laughter] 

410.83 413.63 A: right so 

412.41 413.58 B: so yeah 

413.85 426.71 B: i think that's it that it gets out of our topic and goes into something that i think is actually missing in in today's society with children is ah being involved there's no involvement with parents i mean you sound very involved just 

420.67 422.92 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

426.30 437.47 A: oh i try i'm probably not as much as i should be i'm usually out making money but my wife's a stay at home mom and to some degree she's actually a part time tupperware lady 

427.37 428.58 B: yeah so 

432.06 433.37 B: ah so's my wife 

434.34 435.28 B: right 

436.86 439.96 B: oh well that's at least it yeah it g- it [laughter] 

437.59 438.43 A: so 

438.84 442.66 A: hold on a second hey don't cross the street 

442.94 443.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

443.59 445.73 A: i think they'll love that on the recording 

445.38 448.95 B: [laughter] oh that's just all part of it i think actually 

445.97 446.83 A: so 

448.75 459.29 A: so [laughter] this him and his friend ah i'm across the street and he's over there with the kid's mom and ah they're both just walking across the street coming to me and i'm like 

457.25 457.81 B: (( [mn] )) 

457.84 460.03 B: as if nothing's a big deal [noise] 

459.34 463.06 A: yeah so i mean it really isn't there's no cars but they don't know that and 

462.41 467.91 B: well that's not the point yeah exac- [laughter] the point is no crossing the street
