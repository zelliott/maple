207.48 208.68 A: yeah 

207.99 210.65 B: 'cause then it's kind of exhausted afterwards 

209.91 211.55 A: right 

210.69 218.59 B: it's only seven days a week is like too much already it's but i try to do like one day like let's say monday wednesday fridays

218.29 219.82 A: yeah 

218.96 231.87 B: and sundays sometimes so i do one day monday and then tuesday i rest wednesday i do it so like that 'cause it's kind of if i have to wake up in the morning every day and go to sleep at around one o'clock in the morning 

220.65 221.56 A: okay 

231.71 232.92 A: right 

232.15 233.91 B: (( [sigh] mhm [noise] )) 

233.59 234.21 A: [sigh] 

234.01 239.09 A: yeah for me the the exercise itself i i tell you i'm not really a great big fan of it but i 

239.01 249.21 A: but it makes me feel good and what i what i do is i kind of i i work some other things into that like make it where the exercise isn't by itself so great 

240.25 242.11 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

249.08 254.46 A: i really like uh they have uh a steam room and a sauna and so forth you know where at the y. where i go 

250.52 251.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

254.55 255.68 A: and so 

254.96 257.10 B: (( right so you relax there )) 

256.30 262.18 A: yeah so and the so and so doing that after exercising feels you know really great 

261.79 263.47 B: mhm 

262.25 265.37 A: and it's a good relaxing time for me so uh 

266.02 274.11 A: so it helps me keep going to do it the other thing i do is when i go on the machines i often um i often listen to some music 

268.52 269.66 B: mhm 

274.84 284.16 A: and uh and that that seems to be like it's really good i notice listening to music then because it's like um it's almost like dancing although it you know you can't quite do that much 

282.28 285.94 B: [noise] [noise] just uh [laughter] 

284.59 295.44 A: and [laughter] and uh and then i just it just seems like i can kind of really get into the music more than if i'm doing like you know other stuff that occupies my brain somewhere you know 

295.42 298.65 B: yeah probably it does 

298.84 299.80 B: (( yeah that's )) 

299.33 300.75 A: (( so so )) 

301.07 307.53 A: so where where where do you live someplace where it's warm generally or or has cold winters 

306.73 309.30 B: good no i live in california 

308.73 314.08 A: oh california so you well you can like be doing stuff outside all any time all the time 

309.53 310.51 B: yeah 

312.31 316.80 B: oh yeah probably like run or jog maybe even a walk 

315.31 316.14 A: yeah 

316.28 330.31 A: well see what i i just went to the y. today as it happens and i put my membership uh on hold over the summer 'cause i thought you know i don't really want to be coming in here the weather's got so nice now i think i'm going to go do stuff outside 

327.20 330.62 B: (( mhm )) 

330.28 334.55 A: but it remains to be seen if i can actually if i'll actually do that 

334.05 335.92 B: mm yeah like walk around the beach 

335.74 345.64 A: yeah i live uh i live in seattle pretty close to to the water where there's uh it's like a waterfront uh park trail uh and uh so i can i can 

345.56 350.88 A: roller skate down there or bicycle or jog or walk or whatever 

350.81 351.68 B: (( mm )) 

351.03 357.14 A: that's that's like i think for me what's going to be my primary activity through the summer here 

357.42 359.60 B: and it actually keeps you healthy anyway 

359.36 362.98 A: i think so yeah and it sure is nice down there 

360.32 361.93 B: yeah 

362.43 364.52 B: (( yeah i mean they )) 

363.56 365.81 A: nicer than in the gym [laughter] 

365.00 373.18 B: [laughter] and it probably and the other thing about exercise it prevents from you know having a whole bunch of [noise] 

373.23 374.28 B: of um 

374.35 375.77 B: how do you say it 

375.38 376.58 A: health problems 

375.81 377.75 B: (( health problems early on )) 

377.10 379.71 A: yeah that's what i'm hoping um 

379.54 393.41 A: you know i i don't know the question is is like you know how much do you need to do they say you know well you know if you do like it it varies you know so some people say oh you really need to do some things where you work hard and then they say no no you only have to like walk 

393.43 399.00 A: no you don't even have to go for a walk as long as you're up and around doing things all day that's fine too 

399.10 402.89 B: but everybody says different things that's the problem you don't even know who to believe 

399.22 400.45 A: [sigh] so i 

400.79 401.94 A: (( yeah i know )) 

402.62 403.64 A: i know 

404.01 407.94 A: so i guess what i think is that i i don't know i 

408.29 422.77 A: guess if i i feel like it's kind of a good thing for me to do some exercise that is aerobic you know that really gets me working kinda hard but it doesn't seem like i have to do a lot of that to to sort of get a ongoing benefit 

413.76 414.62 B: [noise] 

422.24 423.17 B: (( mm )) 

422.66 427.20 A: i do that you know three four times a week maybe half an hour 

426.56 429.38 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

427.40 429.95 A: seems that that seems to do the trick for me 

430.09 431.25 B: (( oh okay )) 

431.60 436.48 B: half an hour no two for me two hours 'cause then it gets me very energetic afterwards and 

437.06 441.10 B: it gets me going through the day and doesn't get me that lazy you know 

437.09 438.18 A: (( yeah )) 

441.10 444.95 A: yeah yeah well yeah as long as it's energizing you 

444.82 446.06 B: yeah doesn't [noise] 

445.26 451.74 A: sounds great i think if i did it for two hours i think i'd just like you know go home and like lay down [laughter] 

450.81 453.55 B: [laughter] [noise] the day goes 

452.58 467.12 A: i don't know i don't know there are times there are times like you know i'll go on a big hike or something like that you know like climb all day and you know i could do it all day you know eight hours or something like that but uh you know at the end of the day i'm glad i'm not doing it tomorrow 

457.33 458.08 B: (( mm )) 

461.33 463.07 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

466.88 469.48 B: (( [laughter] )) 

467.35 473.28 A: [laughter] one one day is enough for me but [laughter] but it's worth it just to feel that 

472.70 479.85 B: it's kind it's all it's all kind keeping up a routine i mean at the beginning it is kind of you know hectic and it's tiring [noise] 

475.93 476.73 A: yeah 

479.58 480.58 A: yeah 

479.88 486.22 B: but once you get the motion and you keep on going [noise] you don't have that problem of getting tired and not being able to 

485.64 487.32 A: yeah 

486.50 488.10 B: to keep on going [noise] 

488.08 491.16 A: yeah i'm see i i've never been really good at a routine 

491.14 492.09 B: no 

491.57 497.78 A: that this that's my problem with the with the exercise so i'm kinda on again off again 

498.13 500.78 B: see that's a problem with a lot of people 

499.59 500.74 A: i know 

500.90 501.95 B: see 

500.95 504.04 A: i know well i think i think it's the biggest problem for people 

503.57 504.71 B: yeah 

504.26 511.08 A: and uh like you say if i i once it was really great i had uh on my job where i worked there was a gym 

509.81 511.62 B: (( mhm mm )) 

511.48 521.34 A: and so i would it was like it was built into my day end of the day about uh two thirty i would go to the gym for an hour and that would be the last hour of my day 

521.37 533.81 A: and then i would come out of work and instead of and my wife would come pick me up and when i started doing that she could see such a big difference 'cause i would you know usually i i did you know a lot of sit in one place brain work and i would come out at the end of the day 

533.68 544.64 A: feeling you know seeming like really tired and burned out but when i came out after i did the work my workout it was like i was like fresh and awake and alive and she thought it was great 

544.18 545.33 B: (( mm mm [noise] )) 

545.19 547.21 A: but i don't work there any more 

547.49 548.92 B: (( oh )) 

549.60 550.46 B: (( well )) 

551.09 553.71 A: can you believe this is less than ten minutes 

553.71 555.66 B: it's been less than ten minutes 

553.78 554.89 A: [laughter] 

555.31 559.02 A: well that's what they keep they say they keep us on for just ten minutes 

559.55 565.68 B: hm and how many minutes have we had already my last i 

561.71 572.82 A: i don't know well let's see well my well i guess i can tell by my my palm well yeah it should be coming right up i think they're any minute they're they're going to be telling us to say goodbye but not yet 

571.60 572.64 B: (( [laughter] )) 

573.06 575.33 B: yeah so 

574.32 578.01 A: [sigh] so so what do you think this uh this study is all about 

577.46 579.45 B: [lipsmack] i'm not sure 

578.85 586.09 A: yeah i i think it just has to do with maybe they're trying to figure out how to um 

586.19 594.98 A: how to do voice recognition or something with different kinds of of phone systems or how much fidelity there is something like that 

591.34 593.25 B: mhm 

595.10 596.29 B: (( hm )) 

595.81 597.26 A: first time i was on 

597.28 599.96 A: the subject had to do with terrorism and i thought
