119.95 121.92 A: yeah 

120.08 125.40 B: and if it's if it's worth it i'll go and see it but that's kind of because this town has like nothing else to do

424.01 425.59 B: it is a lot of times 

425.26 428.09 A: the only thing that sucks is i love movie theatre popcorn

446.15 452.15 B: it's a small town i mean people will have no problem doing that and the money all pretty much goes to the same place anyway 

452.13 453.65 A: yeah that's true [noise] 

453.11 455.81 B: whether you watch it at home or you rent it from somewhere 

455.48 457.52 A: uh-huh [noise] 

457.87 466.05 B: i don't know it's kind of nice to live in a small town on the other hand there's some inconveniences like we don't always get the movies and 

465.13 466.98 A: yeah how small is your town 

467.22 470.20 B: oh about six thousand people 

470.22 471.40 A: oh wow 

470.41 471.41 B: um 

471.87 474.45 B: right in the middle of nowhere in montana 

474.46 475.34 A: ooh 

475.38 479.75 B: which pretty much applies to every town on montana but 

475.49 476.12 A: [sigh] 

478.92 480.90 A: [noise] i bet it's pretty though 

480.98 484.28 B: it is it's it's worth it that's why i've stayed around here 

483.45 491.44 A: [noise] yeah wasn't there like is is are you around like ah a bigger town that has like movie theatres or big ones or good ones 

491.49 495.49 B: nearest town from here is twenty three miles away 

495.68 499.59 B: um and it's actually over some rather treacherous roads 

499.46 500.45 A: oh 

500.18 502.80 B: and that's that has a bunch of theatres in it but 

500.68 501.89 A: [noise] [noise] 

502.77 503.76 A: yeah 

503.13 505.69 B: getting getting there's a headache a lot of times

508.13 511.35 A: see our next town over they have two movie theatres 

512.41 515.60 A: but um that town is like really gross 

515.88 516.85 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

516.09 520.66 A: really like really it's really gross there's hippies everywhere 

520.97 526.48 A: and then um the next one over it's probably about half an hour away it has two movie theatres that are 

526.60 527.69 A: pretty good 

527.86 530.61 A: so they're just building us a theatre though 

530.73 531.94 A: in our town 

532.40 536.05 A: it's taken them like a year and they don't even have it half way done but [sigh] 

536.80 539.82 A: hopefully pretty soon we can watch movies [laughter] in a movie theatre 

536.82 538.06 B: (( yeah the )) 

540.18 543.96 B: one we have isn't spectacular but not bad 

543.95 544.88 A: yeah 

544.45 545.33 B: (( it's um ah )) 

545.55 549.87 B: it's just small two theatres both very small 

550.03 551.89 B: can hold i think ah 

552.21 555.01 B: fifty people in one and like seventy in the other 

554.94 557.93 A: [laughter] hope they don't get any popular movies 

555.82 557.15 B: wh- when movies 

557.62 562.57 B: well it's just that when movies like titanic came which stayed for like titanic was here for four months 

562.43 563.77 A: oh my goodness 

562.87 564.20 B: and it showed like 

564.51 569.19 B: more than any other movie and every night for the first two months they were 

569.39 572.71 B: filling up the seats and they had people standing in the back 

573.06 574.59 A: so how many times did 

573.19 574.80 B: and at the theatre here 

574.98 578.29 B: th- they violated all these fire codes and got in big trouble for it 

578.02 579.39 A: [laughter] 

579.36 580.16 B: so 

580.75 584.57 A: yeah that was a all right movie so what's your do you have a favorite movie 

586.06 595.47 B: favorite movie [sigh] not really i i do like a good horror or scary movie i mean something that really just gets you kind of freaked out 

594.88 595.86 A: (( [noise] [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

595.80 599.89 B: and i'd have to say house on a haunted hill is about the only movie that's ever truly done that to me
