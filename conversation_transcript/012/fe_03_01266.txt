354.70 355.74 A: uh-huh 

355.36 361.49 B: but yeah theatre would have been pretty bad i think for me yeah 

358.49 360.04 A: oh i'm sure 

360.58 373.84 A: yeah i felt like it like i remember a couple of years ago when these movies came out i watched about three movies all at the same time that were all like the same kind of movie snatch blow 

371.90 372.98 B: mhm 

373.93 375.55 A: and traffic 

375.53 378.19 B: oh that's a long time ago huh 

376.56 377.58 A: you know those 

377.78 383.60 A: yeah but all three of those movies came out around the same time and blow snatch 

382.98 385.09 B: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah )) 

383.83 392.19 A: and traffic they all seemed like the same movie over and over again lots of drugs lots of people dying or at least you know getting shot 

392.07 393.75 B: yeah yeah yeah yeah 

393.08 406.43 A: it seemed like all the same movie but i remember i saw all three of those movies in like a span of two weeks and then i could- and i couldn't remember which movie happened to w- you know what happened in which movie because they all just blended together 

398.71 402.04 B: you did huh [laughter] 

406.24 415.34 B: uh-huh you know at the theatre you can really get into the story and you know video too huh even i- it even if it's a smaller screen 

413.54 420.02 A: but sometimes with videos like you can talk and you can do other things so maybe you're not so attached to it 

417.40 418.48 B: mhm 

419.93 421.99 B: yeah yeah 

421.15 426.56 A: i think the best movie ever on big screen was ah was mi- ah 

423.91 424.81 B: uh-huh 

426.77 428.41 A: mission impossible 

428.13 429.20 B: oh

429.70 431.28 B: that was good huh 

433.89 434.81 B: yeah 

434.94 438.31 B: yeah yeah those kind of movies i think [laughter] 

437.06 440.65 A: and the music was good [laughter] 

438.75 446.42 B: yeah yeah the music you have the sound system and the theatre sound is different from home sound systems 

442.60 443.80 A: yeah 

445.45 446.91 A: oh sure 

446.53 449.70 B: i mean the impact and the loudness and all that 

448.78 450.18 A: yeah 

450.06 453.45 B: yeah those movies i think a theatre 

453.56 456.11 B: is definitely more impactful
