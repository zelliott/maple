41.84 50.38 B: well yeah pretty much watch t._v. the war thing is really tough to watch because my dad was in the the middle east when i back in j- when i was in junior high 

50.40 51.71 A: oh really 

51.23 60.31 B: yeah so i'm glad like um when i back then i'm glad they didn't have all that t._v. coverage because it would have been really hard i can't imagine what some of the families are going through 

60.19 65.06 A: right exactly yeah like i i guess i'd w- i watch t._v. too and also 

65.16 72.60 A: just as a college student a lot of kids are into the war and what's going on so like just hear from friends and you know get their opinions on things too 

72.36 73.35 B: mhm 

72.81 73.65 A: but 

73.49 74.52 B: how old are you 

74.61 76.07 A: um nineteen 

75.80 85.68 B: oh you're young i'm twenty four [laughter] just had to think about it so i'm not too that you know that much older but junior high was in the whole war thing and my dad was over there um in the gulf war and 

77.79 78.91 A: oh okay 

85.56 92.32 B: it was so tough especially at junior high and and i'm just so glad i didn't have to watch it on t._v. like families do right now 

92.20 93.29 A: right 

92.92 105.14 B: i mean i can imagine a college student and that sort of thing it'd be really interesting in that you know you can see a whole new perspective of it but i don't think they've taken into account what it's doing to some of the families that have to watch it in day in and day out 

104.71 111.22 A: yeah that's definitely true yeah do you know anyone who's right now in the in the military in the war at all 

109.11 109.74 B: (( [sigh] )) 

110.38 120.60 B: i do my friend um her husband's over there and it's been really tough for her 'cause they've been trying to get pregnant and she just had a miscarriage and then her husband got called up 

113.44 114.75 A: or oh wow 

121.38 126.15 A: gosh yeah wow yes it's a bad series of events yeah 

121.51 124.43 B: it is very very hard and 

125.40 129.06 B: and then i also have a friend who's over there he's in special ops 

129.15 130.35 A: oh wow 

130.08 140.33 B: so it's you know of course i don't know where he is or what he's doing for obvious reasons but um yeah i have a lot of good friends that are involved because i grew up in a military family 

140.31 147.77 A: right i got ya do do people in utah generally like would you say support the war or there are a lot of people who are against it or both or 

147.19 151.90 B: oh there's a lot of support it's it's almost close to eighty percent 

149.06 150.24 A: that's good 

151.97 153.22 B: for supporting 

153.26 154.25 A: right 

153.99 163.37 B: and i saw um one they did a a re- a a report on one guy who was a p._o._w. in the gulf war or no he was um 

163.56 167.21 B: uh he was older than that back i may wanna say vietnam and 

167.13 173.46 B: and uh he was saying what they do to the p._o._w.s is they try to manipulate their mind as much as they can 

173.28 185.96 B: and so they show reports of like protesters and like people who are so against the war and and just everything to to make them feel bad like 'cause they would see reports of protesters and then they're like 

173.36 174.29 A: okay 

185.78 192.71 B: we're over here we're a prisoner of war and nobody supports us you know they they do that on purpose and [sigh] um 

192.12 193.17 A: (( wow )) 

192.74 196.86 B: and so now i see these reports of the protesters and i'm like do they know that 

196.91 200.81 B: what they could be doing to people who are prisoners right now and [noise] it's really 

199.93 201.85 A: right jeeze 

201.70 203.85 B: it's really interesting to see 

204.01 205.17 A: yeah 

205.23 210.20 B: so of course we get a lot of emails too about people who are for or against are you for or against 

205.24 206.31 A: (( yeah wow uh )) 

209.98 213.58 A: i i believe i'd say i'm for because i mean 

213.70 221.18 A: you know regardless of the reasons why you just have to support the troops who are there fighting for you you know 'cause i think the worst thing is you don't want another vietnam 

219.78 220.62 B: [noise] 

221.03 223.25 B: exactly oh yeah 

221.39 222.43 A: (( you know )) 

222.67 230.53 A: i mean like if i was over there you know i'd hate to come back and you know have my whole country not appreciate what i'm doing for them you know 

230.17 239.90 B: yeah that's what the p._o._w.s were like you know they were [noise] prisoners of wars and like don't these people know what we're doing over here and you know they're not supporting me and um 

230.79 231.64 A: so 

232.39 233.37 A: right 

239.25 240.18 A: right 

240.01 248.88 B: yeah i totally agree it what you know nobody wants war but if when it happens you just have to be supportive you gotta you know you gotta know that 

249.07 255.11 B: have the troops know that you know people are behind them and that they're doing it they're there for a cause and 

254.73 255.85 A: yeah 

256.40 265.77 B: so [noise] especially when you know for me personally i know you know several people who are involved and you know growing up in a military background 

256.45 258.40 A: yeah ab- absolutely 

265.91 268.99 A: yeah this is true it's interesting 

267.91 272.06 B: so it's really hard to see like a lot of the protests sometimes though i very i 

272.60 277.18 B: totally understand and i appreciate their diligence and like what they believe 

276.93 278.15 A: right 

277.70 282.64 B: it's you know just sometimes i'm like just look at the whole big picture [laughter] 

281.90 282.97 A: yeah 

283.23 284.07 B: so 

283.31 296.56 A: yeah and and there are points like i mean if if you think about it how people are dying every day right now you know in iraq ev- and everything and without getting rid of saddam hussein you know who knows but that'll continue forever maybe now 

296.50 302.48 A: you know we sacrifice some lives [mn] it's unfortunate but maybe it's for the for the greater good you know 

302.16 308.53 B: exactly especially when you saw people so excited to see some of the troops in the towns that they're in 

307.44 314.17 A: yeah exactly exactly i mean yeah i mean we i think we do have the support of the of the iraqi public so 

314.19 324.69 B: i remember watch- well earlier today they were doing a report on um some of the iraqi television and and how they manipulate the minds of the iraqi people saying 

324.72 325.74 B: um 

325.95 328.21 B: day in and day out you know 

328.39 332.18 B: lies basically and propaganda um 

331.53 332.76 A: definitely 

332.48 339.62 B: it's just so sad that they're not free and they don't have that opportunity to see you know the actual true sides of the story 

339.40 340.92 A: that's true yeah 

340.62 343.70 B: mm so they i mean propaganda but 

343.85 357.15 B: they were just oh it was so disturbing i had to turn it they they had i guess children who were dying or like just been you know shot and in pain saying that the americans had caused this 

357.22 358.33 A: (( really )) 

357.72 362.23 B: and it was so it was just i i had to change the channel i couldn't watch it 

361.90 370.27 A: yeah yeah they definitely have a lot of like i mean the names of the streets over there there are street names like saddam is great and saddam is good it's almost silly you know 

367.95 368.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

369.99 371.01 B: (( oh )) 

370.95 372.89 A: but yeah 

371.53 379.03 B: that's ridiculous but if we can make it if if the u._s. can make it a better place that it'd be all worth it 

379.11 386.69 A: yeah i mean hopefully n- you know not at the expense of too many american lives which which already it's gonna happen i mean it's inevitable you know 

383.10 383.85 B: oh 

386.40 387.72 B: yeah 

387.09 392.49 A: but uh could you know just there's so much confusion and so much going on that some lives are gonna be lost you know 

392.23 394.11 B: [noise] exactly yeah 

393.45 394.42 A: but 

394.82 396.23 A: yeah 

394.87 398.78 B: oh it's just a really weird time right now [laughter] 

398.60 400.06 A: yeah definitely 

399.82 409.96 B: and i and i guess i'm more with 'cause i have a two year old and a eight month old and and i have to turn the channel 'cause i don't want my two year old seeing those images all day either anyways 

409.65 414.40 A: yeah that is true and it's it's tough to get away from it it's like every channel you know there's like an update 

413.22 414.08 B: (( oh )) 

414.20 421.23 B: no kidding and saturday morning cartoons are preempted by news and i was like no i like the saturday morning cartoons 

420.79 421.97 A: (( yeah )) 

421.94 434.64 B: [laughter] so [laughter] so uh i mean it i hope it all works out in the end but i at the same time you just have this weird feeling that it's not gonna last it's it's gonna last longer than than what everybody thinks 

422.44 423.83 A: yeah that's true 

434.40 442.95 A: yeah i i don't see how quick it it could be i mean everyone was saying you know be bang bang bang in and out but i i really don't know i mean 

443.96 444.53 B: (( [noise] ))
