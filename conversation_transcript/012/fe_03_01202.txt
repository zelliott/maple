7.32 14.46 B: did one of these surveys uh uh back in january uh tw- january twenty second was the last one i done 

14.69 19.50 A: i've never done if before i'm not quite sure how to carry on a conversation 

17.52 31.95 B: well what you just supposed to uh uh talk and say uh just what you think about the subject you know uh uh the last subject i had was about allergies about you know about allergies you know how how often do you get 'em and stuff 

31.95 44.98 B: and so it's just what do you think about the subject you know he asked um would if you could get a million dollars from a person a unknown source but you can never talk to your best friend ever again 

44.99 51.09 B: would you accept the million dollars so you're supposed to give your response to that uh how you feel about that subject 

50.85 63.78 A: well verna if i had to do that i'm probably very mercenary i'd think pretty hard about it um a million dollars could change your lifetime and you'd probably have a lot of new friends on the other hand i'd be uh 

61.43 62.34 B: yeah 

63.80 67.74 A: walking away from somebody i knew for over twenty five years 

69.40 73.67 A: not quite like being married to somebody but it's pretty darn close

82.24 94.41 B: i have friends but i really don't have close friends the closest friend to me is my husband and i'm married to him [laughter] and so uh myself uh i could accept the million dollars 

94.21 101.34 B: 'cause i really can't say i have a friend that is really like my favorite friend you know best friend if 

99.61 110.71 A: well now if your best if you've been married to a person who's your husband and that's like your best friend then really if the question was like that what if it was rephr- you know it meant that 

108.97 114.86 B: it was rephrased that it i'd have to give rid of my husband then no i wouldn't take it [laughter] 

114.12 118.59 A: so your husband's worth a million bucks to you you gotta let him know that 

116.31 128.94 B: yeah i've been married to him fifteen years and he's the only person that i have been with and i will accept unless i can have john travolta my favorite actor which i know i can't have [mn] uh-huh 

127.97 132.03 A: well how do you know if you had a million bucks you might be able to pal around with him 

129.41 130.58 B: [laughter] 

131.08 132.31 B: i don't know 

132.12 147.09 B: yeah probably but john travolta uh has a lot more so um so uh i could yeah i could probably then i could probably hire him and go out on a a date with him like once i told my husband uh he knows i like john travolta 

146.92 156.54 B: and he uh took me to a to see his movie on my birthday in fact it it came out on my birthday and and he said well there's john travolta

183.66 184.77 B: no uh 

184.56 198.83 B: but if it well came down if i had to get rid of my husband no i wouldn't take it but if it uh came down to anybody else uh a friend yeah i can't say i have a closest friend you know
