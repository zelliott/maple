0.06 2.06 A: hi my name is kathy 

1.82 3.66 B: hi i'm lindsey 

4.43 5.60 B: and i 

5.65 10.04 B: no i don't believe in affirmative action and hiring practices in general 

11.21 12.23 A: me too 

12.32 13.30 A: i 

14.20 15.42 A: feel 

16.97 20.16 A: this isn't really a topic that i 

20.22 21.56 A: have a lot of 

21.82 24.18 A: information on but 

24.79 25.77 A: um 

26.37 31.26 A: i'd be more than willing to learn more about the topic if somebody 

31.44 32.72 A: could ah 

32.85 36.30 A: explain more into detail what it involves 

37.11 47.21 B: yeah i i i agree with you a little ah a little bit there um about not not having information about the things that go on it's not really as much a hot topic in the news 

47.28 48.19 A: yeah 

47.40 50.92 B: as it's been you know in the past and um 

49.93 50.89 A: mhm 

51.94 60.86 B: a lot of places where i've been i've been in the minority even if i didn't believe in such things and it was mostly when i was in college that they were introducing affirmative action 

60.92 67.02 B: um within college you know within college recruiting and you know letting people in you know 

67.04 69.27 B: and things like that and it was 

70.14 82.19 B: really it it my feel- my i honestly have a hard time saying that i don't believe in it because the politically correct thing to say is that you know we owe these people something but at the same time 

82.82 87.93 B: being female i'd rather know that i got a position based on merit 

88.22 92.70 B: than based on gender or anything else and so 

88.35 89.45 A: (( oh yeah )) 

92.54 104.45 B: you know i think the problem is is that you really kind of take it too far whenever you say that you you have to hire people based on something and it really kind of reduces the level of expertise overall 

104.41 106.93 A: definitely i think that there's so much 

107.09 116.07 A: that people can get into but because certain people get hired you know for things and well like you were saying with the um 

116.37 125.28 A: ah with the colleges and their the acceptances and stuff like that i think a lot of people who deserve to get into special places um 

126.00 126.99 A: just 

127.80 132.09 A: they're not getting the opportunities because other people are getting the job and 

132.10 133.10 A: um 

133.87 143.66 A: and if it's to my understanding correctly you know it's not just you know a gender issue it's also a racial ah sometimes maybe age is 

144.03 148.72 B: yeah in fact yeah and you know that's really disturbing too i mean 

144.06 145.08 A: (( that correct mm )) 

148.88 156.88 B: if i think that if someone can do the job then they should just look at in a blind way and i'm always um partial to 

157.49 161.16 B: not revealing anything basically having 

162.26 164.95 B: [sigh] having applications that 

165.19 173.31 B: basically this is candidate a candidate b. and taking everything that's not specifically related you know 

173.76 183.67 B: basically cultural things or that you know basically i wouldn't put on my resume that i was in a sorority because that would define me as female i wouldn't put on my resume that i 

183.83 184.75 B: um 

185.02 195.81 B: you know wa- went to certain churches because it could affect religious things or i have ha- were a member of any cultural organizations um if i think maybe it would be better just to start out 

196.12 199.55 B: doing things where maybe they did blind interviews or 

199.59 207.58 B: um online interviews where you know you basically were able to show what you were and what you could do without actually 

207.59 208.63 B: letting 

208.79 210.56 B: other things get in the way 

210.70 211.55 A: yeah 

210.72 212.19 B: that make sense 

212.18 217.44 A: no that totally makes sense you know there's some places like i know home depo- well 

217.61 223.96 A: see where i work now they didn't they didn't do it this way but i'm applying at different places 

223.88 234.59 A: and home depot instead of ah doing um oh i'm sorry not home depot wallgreens instead of doing you know a person to person interview 

234.62 237.90 A: they ask you for um 

237.94 251.02 A: number one why you think that you'd be good for the job why you think you have merit and two they put you in scenarios on a computer that you would have to solve so i like wallgreens principles and the fact that you know 

251.43 252.55 A: the only 

252.86 256.78 A: contact that you have initially before you get hired 

256.67 257.63 B: mhm 

257.00 267.44 A: is ah with the person who set you up on the computer after that it's all with the computer a- and as we know computer has no preference it just knows what merit is 

265.51 266.52 B: right 

267.42 276.32 B: and actually it's kind of the same thing we do a lot of work with monster dot com which is you know the employment website and um they happen to say 

274.99 277.01 A: did you say mon- monster dot com 

276.68 278.37 B: monster dot com mhm 

277.79 278.77 A: okay 

278.51 292.61 B: and um we do like we'll have screening questions that we can fill out where you know you basically can ask ahead of time so that whenever the resumes go through it's like yes or no questions but you can kind of get a feel for 

292.77 297.94 B: you know what the person is is like and everything and so the resumes that you end up getting 

298.14 299.06 B: (( you know )) 

299.09 304.95 B: are ones that the computer has gone through and and selected that so you don't really even have a chance to 

305.00 306.00 A: oh 

305.52 307.28 B: you know pick people that 

308.03 312.77 B: i mean you well you can weed through people after that obviously but it kind of pre weeds for you 

311.09 311.97 A: (( yeah )) 

312.85 314.10 B: based on 

313.08 313.87 A: (( now )) 

314.22 315.03 B: (( yeah )) 

315.02 316.14 A: go ahead 

315.92 318.78 B: oh no so- i'm sorry i was finished [laughter] 

317.99 323.72 A: oh no oh okay um i just i just wanted to know if you knew any companies in general that 

324.33 324.98 A: (( i )) 

325.06 326.35 A: that did that 

326.61 327.95 A: like they 

328.04 329.98 A: hired based upon 

330.06 330.93 A: (( um )) 

331.65 332.57 A: (( ah )) 

333.57 336.13 A: forgotten sorry just lost my train of thought 

335.89 336.83 B: that's okay 

336.70 337.71 A: um 

340.04 341.29 A: preference 

341.44 343.60 A: wh- the what the whole purpose of this 

343.81 347.65 A: this phone survey and i just totally forgot what the name of it was 

348.31 349.37 B: um 

348.47 349.43 A: um the h- 

349.94 352.07 A: affirmative did you say affirmative 

351.27 353.54 B: yeah affirmative action i guess 

352.93 355.86 A: affirmative okay affirmative action i'm sorry 

356.88 358.03 A: (( i totally [laughter] )) 

356.98 358.96 B: that's okay [laughter] 

358.10 361.34 A: but if [laughter] you know it's one of those days 

359.61 361.73 B: (( i totally understand )) 

361.47 363.83 A: it's one of those days but um 

363.92 367.54 A: okay do you know of any companies that do that specifically 

368.22 369.19 B: um 

369.28 374.32 B: no i really the only thing i know i think a lot of companies do it um 

374.47 377.73 B: and whenever i've gone on looking at job searches and stuff 

378.22 381.45 B: they use it more like as a screening technique 

380.80 381.68 A: yeah 

381.57 393.16 B: um but i don't know that anybody that will hire totally based on a survey and i mean i'm not advocating that at all but you know i think it would be interesting i think it would be interesting to see how people 

389.32 390.22 A: oh no 

393.25 398.59 B: you know and it would depend on the job and everything because obviously you don't want to hire people without any 

398.63 405.20 B: face to face contact but if they did more screening online or you know in some facets where 

405.34 413.90 B: you didn't necessarily get to meet you know the person ahead of time because i know like speaking to people online a lot of the times i will be 

414.12 415.52 B: not nec- i mean 

415.58 420.32 B: people will present themselves in a in a different way i think in 

419.03 420.07 A: mhm 

420.36 425.97 B: you'll i mean it's just it's a much more a lot of times it can be like a more friendly atmosphere because you're not 

426.33 437.49 B: um dealing with so many prejudices and you don't really know that much about this person and then sometimes i find out peop- like some of my some of the people that i work with like i never meet in person and then whenever i 

437.54 442.12 B: you know you get this idea of what somebody looks like or sounds like and you just 

441.44 442.34 A: (( yeah )) 

442.29 449.22 B: you know and then you're kind of blown away by the difference and so it just kind of shows how you kind of um 

449.64 455.67 B: take things and assess certain traits for people based on just the kind of the things that they say or 

455.69 457.80 B: you know just whatever 

455.72 456.63 A: yes 

456.68 465.67 A: it can be go- it can be good because you know then at least when you meet somebody then you can use y- like for i should say more for employers 

465.77 469.02 A: ah when you meet somebody when you're hiring them 

469.13 479.64 A: you know you get a feeling of who these people are some people go with their gut feeling but all the time i don't know i don't think that's but i have a question real quick if i can 

479.52 480.14 B: mhm 

479.78 480.73 A: um 

480.88 483.49 A: if my phone cuts off in the middle 

483.62 486.18 A: of this ah of this call 

486.73 488.31 A: what would happen because 

488.41 489.66 B: um 

489.73 497.53 B: i don't know i know like i missed a call and they just said that i called the number back and it was the um i actually spoke to a person 

490.23 490.96 A: my 

497.57 504.75 B: and they said that the phone would just keep dialing and then like about thirty minutes later i i got this call and i was able to take it so 

504.83 510.25 B: i guess maybe the phone would call you back or i i don't know that would be something but if you'd 

510.34 512.87 B: hang if you dial back the number that 

513.17 517.27 B: um that called you you can speak to a live person and ask them 

517.35 518.52 A: oh okay 

517.58 520.17 B: [laughter] that's all i know 

519.15 522.15 A: this is my first time doing this and i didn't know
