36.02 36.41 A: so 

36.86 39.08 A: money for me is a real big thing 

39.79 40.15 A: um 

40.31 41.80 A: i don't know if i could do it though 

42.32 44.38 A: because i mean without my best friend 

42.43 42.90 B: i don't 

45.62 47.02 A: i i would be lost 

47.49 48.41 B: that is true 

48.43 50.44 A: like i mean i wouldn't know 

50.95 53.02 A: i wouldn't know what to do 

53.44 54.43 A: or you know 

55.23 56.94 A: what you know what to happen 

57.05 60.34 A: you know like i could have a situation and that there would be no one to turn to

63.97 64.56 A: how about you 

65.11 65.86 B: um no

83.81 84.99 A: so yeah i mean 

85.73 86.00 A: and 

86.17 88.13 A: i mean it it would make like 

88.27 90.39 A: if it weren't an anonymous benefactor 

90.91 92.14 A: like it might make it easier 

92.89 96.31 A: but like just because it is something totally random it is like winning the lottery you know 

96.53 99.71 B: yeah but but then if i knew who it was 

96.95 97.22 A: it just 

99.82 104.74 B: and has given me the million dollars i would be like are you trying to break sabotage me and break up my friendship 

104.43 107.39 A: right or maybe you could convince them you know 

107.69 109.32 A: to like change their mind or whatever 

109.89 110.98 B: but i couldn't do it 

111.21 111.61 A: yeah 

111.26 111.92 B: i would have to 

112.18 115.95 B: -cause i talk to my friend every day like we e. mail each other at our jobs like 

114.29 114.87 A: mhm 

116.45 116.94 A: yeah 

116.45 119.52 B: i hate her at the job and i hate so and so

134.00 134.66 A: right 

136.81 137.46 A: wow 

138.61 140.66 B: that would be so hard no talking to her anymore 

140.70 143.09 A: well it would be a hard choice either way you know 

144.73 145.94 B: it would be too hard -cause 

146.33 147.31 B: she is like my sister 

147.59 148.06 A: yeah 

149.64 152.54 B: -cause even if i like wi- without talking to her for a whole week is just like 

152.96 154.69 B: i didn't talk to you all this week what happened 

154.86 158.93 A: right like you go crazy thinking you've missed years and years and years of experience 

159.54 160.60 B: and then even if i 

160.75 163.09 B: so many things happen during a week so it is just like 

163.26 163.95 B: well what happened 

164.24 164.68 A: right

183.71 184.54 B: so it is just us 

183.73 184.18 A: okay

387.00 387.64 A: yeah 

393.71 394.98 A: oh 

395.73 396.61 B: it is a big scandal 

395.99 396.98 A: that is horrible 

397.80 400.47 B: but yeah that is like my best friend even i think that 

401.18 401.89 B: even if 

402.98 405.75 B: something happened and we just have this major falling out 

405.88 409.02 B: i couldn't i would have to forgive her -cause i couldn't go without talking to her 

408.83 409.91 A: right right 

409.75 410.98 B: i was just like okay 

412.07 412.65 B: i don't know 

412.96 413.48 A: yeah 

417.55 422.64 A: yeah but you know i mean like even for a million dollars then you would have like lots of friends but they wouldn't be real friends 

422.55 424.97 B: friends exactly because you have that million dollars 

424.93 428.36 A: yeah and they are all they are going to do is they are going to want your money 

428.35 429.64 B: and then you have to think about it 

429.81 432.32 B: a million dollars is not really a whole lot of money 

432.70 433.47 A: well yeah 

433.08 433.88 B: especially 

435.80 439.11 B: a million dollars -cause that is like half of it is going right there 

435.87 438.67 A: exactly that is the whole thing 

439.07 439.80 A: yeah 

439.28 440.93 B: and so you've got five hundred thousand 

440.99 441.56 A: yeah 

441.34 443.47 B: then of course you have to pay your bills off and 

443.58 444.21 A: right 

444.55 448.28 B: then you are going to want a new car and a new house and your money is basically gone by then 

448.53 449.08 A: yeah 

450.54 451.67 B: um make-over and 

452.26 453.94 B: where prada and gucci and 

453.97 457.72 A: (( for )) yeah and it only goes so far 

457.57 458.44 B: exactly 

459.04 461.12 B: and at least with my friend we can be poor together 

461.19 461.95 A: exactly 

462.22 464.08 A: exactly it is something you can share 

464.14 465.36 B: exactly it can be 

464.53 466.17 A: -cause when you are rich you are kind of lonely 

466.90 468.07 A: -cause you can't trust anyone 

468.77 469.76 B: then who is to say that 

470.20 473.09 B: anonymous benefactor wouldn't come back and ask for the money back or 

473.23 474.95 A: oh that is true that is really true 

474.80 477.85 B: or wants you to work it off in some way 

476.88 477.54 A: right 

480.66 481.27 A: yeah 

483.88 484.66 A: yeah mhm 

485.04 485.68 A: yeah 

486.95 488.17 A: i might like i might like 

487.09 487.62 B: who would 

488.26 495.02 A: say i wouldn't talk to my friend and then i would just like talk to her anyway or like make up code names or something like that because i would go crazy 

491.64 492.89 B: yes sneak and talk 

494.24 499.51 B: yeah who would know who would actually would he like check and tap your phones and have you followed 

495.97 496.90 A: exactly 

498.37 499.08 A: yeah 

501.03 502.74 B: who would actually know that you were talking to them 

502.91 505.79 A: well that can be actually a a little bit of a disturbing thought but 

506.75 507.37 A: you know it 

508.81 510.08 A: yeah i mean if i 

509.38 510.00 B: (( )) 

510.90 512.82 A: i would actually maybe try to do both 

513.01 513.43 A: maybe 

515.10 515.38 A: but 

515.16 517.94 B: and do both take the money and still talk to your friend 

516.29 517.26 A: yeah 

517.69 522.47 A: but yeah but i think i think my friend i i think she would she would rule out 

523.68 524.84 A: she would win over 

525.07 525.93 A: any sort of money 

528.19 528.50 A: so 

528.21 529.29 B: friends and family 

529.41 530.29 A: y- oh yeah 

530.41 530.85 A: yeah
