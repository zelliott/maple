64.30 66.25 B: wow you're a young a man huh 

66.23 67.72 A: yep i'm eighteen so 

67.96 71.19 B: oh well i'm seventy seven 

70.44 70.96 A: (( ))

80.01 82.02 B: assisted living facility 

82.38 82.81 A: mmm 

83.02 84.14 B: and it's um 

84.88 86.48 B: very expensive 

87.11 87.64 A: oh 

87.19 87.61 B: but 

87.89 90.23 B: but you know i have to have somebody help me 

90.68 93.18 B: cause the left side of my body is uh 

93.62 94.33 B: useless 

94.99 95.32 A: (( ))

120.98 122.99 A: probably have already shared a lot with them 

124.14 126.89 A: so i think kind of making it like a best friend kind a

260.46 261.32 B: mmm 

260.82 261.13 A: but 

262.17 266.18 A: i kind of think it's more important to be happy in a job than the money you're going to make in it 

266.35 267.66 B: oh i do too 

268.06 269.63 B: cause you know radio

310.43 312.12 B: it's kind of well it's 

312.33 314.41 B: kind of an oldies station 

315.07 315.48 A: (( huh )) 

315.82 316.49 B: um 

316.71 319.49 B: like music from the sixties and seventies 

319.74 320.26 A: okay 

321.56 322.74 A: yeah i like oldy 

321.94 324.49 B: and that's what i still listen to 

324.31 325.20 A: then yep 

325.01 325.61 B: mhm 

325.87 328.39 A: i listen to oldies a lot and then some country 

331.49 333.72 B: i never did care too much for the 

334.15 335.49 B: older country 

335.80 336.16 A: mmm 

336.27 337.87 A: yeah i like the new country but 

337.97 338.67 B: mhm 

338.49 339.11 A: i like like 

339.26 343.22 A: older like rock and roll music like beach boys and beatles and things like that 

343.14 344.29 B: mhm mmm 

345.42 346.63 A: lot of the music like 

346.88 350.42 A: today that people like it seems like all they have is like bad words in them and 

351.03 354.49 A: words you can't understand and it's like what's the point of listening to it then 

354.96 359.15 B: oh i can't stand the rap i i don't know what they're saying 

357.14 357.58 A: mhm 

358.96 360.20 A: yep 

360.36 361.95 A: that's why i don't like it and 

362.19 366.04 A: when you do understand what they're saying you're like oh my gosh i can't believe what i'm hearing 

373.35 375.72 B: well i keep thinking about that money 

376.25 376.77 A: yeah 

376.77 379.21 B: and not speaking to my best friend 

379.43 379.87 A: mhm 

380.93 381.60 B: well 

381.88 383.88 A: do you think you'd feel like any different if 

384.45 389.36 A: you'd offered the million dollars if you could only speak to the best friend like once a week or something 

390.80 396.32 B: well i think the way they stated it you know you'd just wouldn't never speak to your best friend again 

390.84 392.61 A: i think to me that would make all the difference 

395.84 396.99 A: yeah so it's like 

397.02 400.29 B: oh yeah if you could speak to them you know occasionally 

400.75 402.41 B: it would make a big difference 

400.85 401.89 A: then that would really help 

403.56 404.54 A: cause then you wonder if 

405.30 411.00 A: how they going to react to that if all of a sudden you never talked to them or they know the reason why and if they found out 

407.76 408.27 B: mmm 

410.13 411.06 B: oh well 

411.73 415.24 B: i would i would definitely want to be able to tell them 

415.88 417.89 B: you know why i couldn't talk with them 

417.21 417.65 A: mhm 

418.64 422.17 A: but if there's something like if they offered you that and you take the money then 

422.70 427.81 A: unless they told them you could never tell them the reason behind it so they must be worried they did something to 

428.15 428.82 B: mmm 

428.56 430.28 A: kind of disrupt the friendship or 

430.13 432.02 B: oh i don't think i could do that 

432.37 432.87 A: yeah 

433.40 434.66 A: well then you have the guilt on 

435.13 437.15 A: how you're impacting their life too 

437.06 437.83 B: mhm 

438.10 442.15 A: or you could take the million and give them half and maybe they'd understand though 

438.65 439.44 B: no i i 

442.23 445.05 B: well that's that's true but 

445.69 448.99 B: maybe you could write to them instead of talking to them 

447.80 448.26 A: mhm 

450.04 450.58 A: yeah 

451.09 452.46 B: and i had a friend 

453.03 457.63 B: we was friends for years and they moved away to be close to their son 

458.48 459.22 B: and uh 

459.88 462.27 B: we write to each other and talk 

462.51 464.76 B: well we talk on the phone but writing 

465.34 466.93 B: is pretty good too you know 

466.98 467.39 A: mhm 

468.64 470.84 A: only hard thing about writing is in like 

471.14 474.86 A: internet conversations is you really can't hear the expression in their voice 

475.81 476.52 B: yeah 

476.86 480.68 A: which i think for me like when i write letters to friends that makes it hard because 

481.63 485.20 A: once sentence depending on how you say it can have such difference meanings 

485.19 485.66 B: oh 

486.11 486.59 B: yeah 

487.16 488.04 B: that's true 

488.43 488.95 B: very true 

490.12 494.80 A: but then again just kind of knowing how that person's doing and that every thing's okay for them 

495.77 497.49 A: really helpful just to know too 

501.34 503.94 B: they have some hard questions i think 

503.83 504.37 A: yeah 

504.97 506.95 A: is this your first one that you've done or 

507.22 511.34 B: know they called me last night and the uh subject was 

511.76 512.98 B: time travel 

513.56 513.82 A: yep 

513.59 516.13 B: well i didn't know a thing about that so i just 

516.27 518.58 B: you know it's just tying up if you don't want (( that )) 

518.68 520.75 B: i hung up 

519.84 520.26 A: yeah 

521.48 522.31 B: cause i (( ))

524.74 525.14 B: (( )) 

524.79 525.13 A: just 

525.68 533.62 A: you have the thing like if you could go back and change one thing cause of time travel i was like oh my gosh i would have to think about for a long time before i gave an answer 

534.95 535.70 B: i i just 

535.89 537.62 B: i didn't know that much about it 

537.94 538.36 A: mhm 

538.63 541.43 B: i've seen (( )) on television about 

542.50 543.32 B: about it but 

543.76 545.89 B: not enough to talk about it 

545.82 546.23 A: yep 

547.69 550.32 B: wonder how many calls we get do you remember 

550.95 553.01 A: i'm pretty sure they said at least three 

553.37 554.14 B: least three 

554.73 555.11 B: well 

554.74 555.05 A: so 

555.83 556.93 B: i lost 

556.05 558.03 A: or three completed calls i think
