53.61 55.09 A: yeah yeah but 

54.35 61.40 B: and i used to work with a guy who [laughter] who he would listen to him just to d- disagree with him so it was always fun to talk with him 

61.02 63.32 A: yeah he does- doesn't hold back very much 

64.25 70.18 B: well he yeah but see he he has his i mean he's got his point of view and he's not bashful about it 

69.88 77.68 A: which is which is true yeah he's he does like i said he doesn't hold back at all if he's if he feels something about something it doesn't matter who it offends he he says it [laughter] 

78.10 81.39 B: and i don't i don't read any newspapers really to speak of 

81.49 85.60 A: um not myself either um i'm pretty much a 

85.79 91.98 A: a a t._v. news person i i find myself uh constantly flicking through the news channels and so forth 

90.97 93.99 B: so what t._v. news do you uh 

93.85 102.60 A: normally i watch the local news um but with everything going on in iraq right now i tend to watch c._n._n. because it seems to have a broader coverage 

100.25 101.28 B: c._n._n. 

102.36 103.23 B: mhm 

103.79 107.53 B: yeah i've done the same thing i've watched them and m._s._n._b._c. 

106.99 108.35 A: right right 

107.58 112.24 B: i've never really cared for local news like most of the days i mean most days 

110.86 112.15 A: oh really 

112.97 115.97 B: uh i don't know the the news stories 

116.82 119.48 B: [mn] don't [laughter] 

117.06 117.97 A: they can be 

118.00 132.24 A: [laughter] they can tend to be a little depressing sometimes and boring but uh i i just moved to the area about nine ten months ago so i uh i tend to find myself um trying to find out a little bit more about the area and things and things that go on 

121.13 122.91 B: yeah 

133.39 134.49 B: i i 

134.69 139.90 B: if i look at a newspaper the problem is i read too much of it so i'll spend like an hour hour and a half 

139.46 141.08 A: mhm 

140.16 142.73 B: and i just don't have that time usually 

142.20 144.11 A: right right 

144.83 148.74 A: but uh yeah they have the uh pentagon briefing on right now as we speak 

150.24 151.72 A: this oughta be interesting 

152.41 155.26 B: do you read like local newspapers 

154.64 165.86 A: [noise] uh y- oh yeah yeah i mean um usually in the morning sometimes for lunch or something i i'll just skim through it find articles that i'm interested in but i don't i don't go too in depth [noise] 

168.60 169.75 A: um 

171.69 172.75 A: that's that's 

172.92 180.59 A: newspaper i don't know no i'm not not not too big on it [laughter] i don't know why [laughter] but uh 

174.22 175.95 B: [laughter] 

182.84 193.40 A: local news i i like the nocal- local news on t._v. that that's a a big a big thing for me and with this whole thing and my brother's in iraq right now so that's a big interest for me yeah 

190.44 191.58 B: oh oh he is 

192.77 195.56 B: you know the other thing i've started listening to is uh 

195.93 196.78 B: uh 

197.08 198.42 B: public radio 

198.65 200.04 A: public radio 

199.51 201.43 B: have you ever listened to public radio 

200.99 209.13 A: when i'm in my car i do um i actually uh have a lo- long commute time between work so uh i tend to listen quite frequently yeah 

202.24 203.22 B: you have 

205.31 206.17 B: uh-huh 

207.52 208.65 B: oh do ya 

209.22 214.22 B: oh that's interesting yeah i like them because it it it certainly gives you a different perspective 

214.66 220.82 A: yeah yeah it does it it's it's definitely different than i'd say like watching it on t._v. to hear it 

221.60 222.92 A: but um 

225.75 233.03 A: i guess my biggest interest in the news right now is just all about this war i i've kind of lost lost track of all the other stuff in the last few weeks 

232.97 235.30 B: no that's true you said your brother 

234.71 240.32 A: yeah my brother my brother's in uh in the army and uh he's been sent over 

239.33 240.94 B: and he's over there now 

240.53 242.29 A: yes he's over there now 

241.75 243.35 B: where is he at do you know 

242.96 255.90 A: uh no they don't i was gonna say yeah when he got shipped out it was unknown destination and uh my father's gotten one phone call but uh they're very very vague about everything you're you're really left out in 

244.18 245.71 B: or they can't tell ya [noise] 

254.36 255.63 B: mhm 

256.13 258.32 A: you know they just don't give you that information 

257.87 260.09 B: so it wasn't that he didn't know 

260.43 263.57 A: uh he sounded like he didn't know too i mean 

260.83 262.22 B: it's just that he 

262.28 263.78 B: oh really 

263.66 271.25 A: yeah he's kinda like just clueless just you get a call and you go and then there's no questions asked but he's been in the military for like eleven years so 

270.88 272.19 B: oh wow 

271.70 274.76 A: mhm [sigh] so uh 

275.23 277.99 B: yeah that's gotta be pretty unnerving to have somebody over there 

277.73 285.02 A: [mn] yeah it actually is um which is probably why i've taken such a a bigger interest in in what's going on um 

285.09 290.04 A: as opposed to a couple of you know desert storm i don't think i took nearly as much interest in 

289.91 292.63 B: yeah actually that's the same with me i didn't uh 

292.71 295.04 B: i didn't follow it nearly like i am this one 

294.32 301.96 A: no it was more like any time i seen it i flicked the channel you know or or or changed the station or you know didn't really get into it too much 

301.62 305.22 B: so what do you think of all this embedded reporter stuff 

305.15 309.28 A: um as far as explain that one 

308.31 310.52 B: (( you know well it it sounds like it's a new )) 

311.31 312.57 B: idea 

314.16 316.70 A: [noise] with what's what's an em- 

315.80 319.21 B: well i don't know um did they they didn't have that kind of reporting before did they 

319.47 326.67 A: oh no no this this reporting is is really high tech with uh the cameras and and the people it seems very it's very organized 

326.31 330.04 B: i just thought it was a brilliant idea to have them in there 

330.43 331.69 A: yeah 

330.51 332.42 B: i mean because well 

332.25 346.34 A: t- t- to a certain degree one yes because you know y- you hear everything you know you don- you don't have to wonder what's going on that you're not being told about but the second part is is is i think that a lot of the information is being put on the news that doesn't need to be put on the news 

339.32 340.31 B: mhm 

346.57 352.22 B: you mean it's just you mean it doesn't need to be why 'cause it's inappropriate or because it's just not news 

351.72 361.10 A: no because um i i think that a lot of the things that are going on um as far as having the reporters right there on location and things like that that there are certain things that are discussed that 

361.26 363.98 A: to me would be a heads up to somebody else 

363.31 364.77 B: oh i see 

364.69 366.13 A: (( so um )) 

365.45 373.61 B: yeah i don't know how they control that i mean i imagine it's controlled somehow 'cause occasionally they say they're not supposed to say this or they're not supposed to divulge that so 

368.46 369.94 A: yeah i believe 

371.30 372.47 A: right 

373.97 376.46 B: somehow they're controlling it 

373.99 375.01 A: right 

376.10 380.56 A: yeah yeah that means we're obviously doing something well we don't seem to be doing too bad at this point 

380.00 385.74 B: i just thought it was smart because you know it it seems like the press is so skeptical 

385.98 388.07 B: of any reporting 

388.10 389.12 A: right 

388.25 394.24 B: and so now they can say look you know [laughter] it's your own guy giving the report so 

393.85 395.11 A: right 

394.54 408.75 B: so you know you you wanna be in fact i've heard a couple of the reporters say that very thing they said well you know we were skeptical about this but since then we've seen this that and the other thing and so i think just by nature i think reporters tend to be skeptical 

408.93 412.95 B: and then uh but to have the access that they do 

412.79 415.02 A: right to be right there yeah 

412.99 413.96 B: which 

414.24 418.07 B: yeah so now and especially with the whole world watching 

418.16 418.73 A: (( [noise] )) 

418.41 423.54 B: because um it it's gonna be really interesting i think to see in the months to come 

423.66 426.69 B: what news comes out because 

427.45 436.70 B: so much of the opposition to the war has been saying you know there's no evidence there's no um you know why are we there we don't need to be doing this 

436.78 438.48 B: and um 

439.00 442.92 B: but the administration is is adamant about 

443.05 444.05 B: um 

444.72 446.46 B: you know the reasons going in 

446.13 447.24 A: right 

446.73 447.82 B: so 

447.84 452.85 B: it it to me it's gonna be very very interesting to see in the next you know when when things start to be 

452.92 458.09 A: [mn] i'd like to see yeah i'd like to see when things settle down and and and a lot of the information like when they 

458.05 470.69 A: kinda sum things up once it's over and and take out that information that they have right now but can't release to us and put it together and like the kinda like the uh the unseen you know what what took place that couldn't be discussed at this point 

463.77 464.80 B: mhm 

470.25 471.75 B: mhm right 

470.99 475.68 A: so i think them collecting that information throughout it will kinda be like maybe historical 

477.02 483.40 A: to a certain degree you know as far as our history is concerned and the specifics [sigh] 

479.85 481.44 B: mhm 

483.48 484.78 A: but 

484.44 487.79 B: but i thought that was i don't know i just thought that was pretty 

487.95 491.25 B: a good idea pretty brilliant i thought but we'll see 

490.89 492.38 A: (( [laughter] )) 

492.44 495.62 A: yeah yeah only time will tell when it comes to that one 

495.16 496.50 B: mhm 

496.48 497.79 A: but uh 

500.16 501.16 A: (( this is )) 

501.21 508.72 A: it's just kinda strange it's just it's just weird to go through day to day life and not real- i haven't heard about anything else going on in this country [laughter] except for this war 

507.25 508.30 B: [laughter] 

510.25 511.65 A: nothing at all 

511.94 514.22 A: except for the smart case that was interesting 

515.04 516.65 A: with elizabeth smart 

516.75 521.23 B: oh yeah that was a while ago though i still haven't heard anything recently about that 

520.92 524.16 A: um i've well i've read a few different articles about it um 

524.24 527.12 A: some updates and things like that and i guess uh 

527.13 530.84 A: they've got quite a few charges on him now i guess he's starting to talk and uh 

531.30 532.34 A: they've got 

531.41 532.98 B: charges on the uh 

532.75 533.88 A: (( on the )) 

533.37 534.82 B: guys that kidnapped her 

534.33 538.19 A: yeah whatever his name was uh emmanuel 

537.89 540.10 B: so was she brainwashed oh jesus 

539.87 549.82 A: she was brainwashed she was sexually abused um it's all come out it's it's it was all yeah a little bit of everything but i guess they said that she's doing really well i mean 

549.95 555.66 A: she's hanging out with her friends and her family and playing and and kinda going back to the same ways but i guess 

555.77 561.83 A: her sheltered family life 'cause she comes from such a very sheltered family that uh 

561.92 566.96 A: yeah i it's gonna be an interesting ride for her to probably over [noise] overcome all that 

566.61 567.81 B: what do you mean 

567.79 570.44 A: well i mean i'm sure that she was 

570.54 576.06 A: probably naive about a lot of things and you know never been away from home really and um 

575.02 576.03 B: mhm 

576.04 586.16 A: you know as far as sexual encounters and things like that it's just seems like something her family's they're gonna all have a hard time dealing with as far as her innocence and her age and things like that is concerned 

582.40 584.19 B: well you know i would think 

585.58 588.14 B: well how old is she now eleven or thirteen or 

587.52 589.17 A: uh i think she's fifteen 

588.98 590.04 B: fifteen 

589.54 591.23 A: yeah i think she's fifteen 

591.37 592.83 B: yeah i don't uh 

593.04 595.98 B: i mean i wouldn't want my daughter to have that kind of 

595.73 599.89 A: no i just i can't im- just you know i really thought that she was 

596.80 598.05 B: [laughter]
