13.25 17.95 B: and i was wondering if there is something seriously wrong with the united states' 

18.20 19.30 B: school system 

20.28 20.93 A: okay 

22.75 26.27 A: are you a part of that school system at the moment 

27.53 29.24 B: no um 

29.54 30.31 B: i'm 

31.49 36.88 B: just doing a survey because um there's been so many schools uh 

36.99 38.63 B: having teachers laid off 

38.94 39.61 B: and 

41.06 45.32 B: what i'm trying to find out is what the public really thinks 

45.59 49.06 A: you know that is an interesting question is fault 

49.45 52.19 A: does the fault weigh with 

52.40 55.22 A: ach the teachers or the students 

66.48 71.57 A: and they are getting an extreme amount of work and 

71.79 73.90 A: the level of work is much more advanced 

75.86 76.34 B: uh-huh 

78.38 79.01 B: uh-huh 

80.37 83.14 A: when i was at the public level you know that's um 

83.25 85.11 A: i think they use the terms 

85.69 90.98 A: we call the public school or elementary level but we were not studying what they are studying now 

91.26 94.29 A: i i'm very impressed with what they are studying but 

94.39 98.69 A: that's because of the region or the area 

98.81 101.50 A: that they live in it is a very affluent level 

101.61 103.94 A: uh area and um 

102.06 102.50 B: uh-huh 

104.47 106.23 A: i think that really plays a great 

107.14 108.18 A: a great role 

109.26 110.29 A: what do you think 

110.91 111.37 B: well 

111.71 112.51 B: um 

112.63 115.97 B: i think that has a lot to with it uh 

116.36 118.27 B: and i'm sure that uh 

118.89 121.87 B: they need all this education because when they get out 

121.98 125.02 B: um they'll be better prepared for college 

126.03 127.48 B: um 

127.71 129.69 B: and my particular area 

129.94 131.02 B: it is more 

131.28 132.76 B: a little bit more behind 

132.79 134.03 A: what area are you 

134.21 134.73 A: in 

134.90 137.48 B: i'm in the western area 

134.93 135.22 A: (( )) 

136.84 138.59 A: um mid- the mid-west 

138.49 138.95 B: yes 

139.83 143.86 A: um (( )) as a matter of fact uh they are in the illinois area 

144.18 144.82 B: right 

145.07 145.61 A: that 

145.75 148.00 A: perhaps an area that you might be close to 

148.26 149.01 B: yes 

149.12 150.71 B: yes i'm close to the 

150.95 152.57 B: um illinois area 

152.82 153.46 B: and 

152.89 153.65 A: uh hm 

153.83 154.82 A: uh their area 

154.61 155.68 B: but um 

156.26 157.70 B: i'm more rural 

157.96 166.21 A: oh okay that does make a big difference they are in the suburbs uh and uh it's uh like i said it is very affluent 

166.41 175.57 A: um i do think that wealth plays a great influence uh in this equation i find that 

176.31 180.20 A: um many of the parents have tutors for their children 

180.48 180.99 B: mhm 

181.54 185.72 A: and uh i find that i also 

191.99 192.65 A: from the parent 

192.95 197.45 A: -s uh uh studying is very important it's uh 

197.55 198.37 A: something to take 

199.35 199.94 A: uh 

200.26 209.67 A: it's it's something that really comes first uh my niece is studying continuously to get her grades up and she does get uh a. -s both of them get a. -s 

209.66 210.95 B: oh that is wonderful 

211.07 212.62 A: um 

212.52 214.18 B: now what about um 

214.53 217.52 B: the teachers you think they are pretty well qualified 

218.65 229.03 A: you know my my pers- my point of view is very limited because i only have two nieces in this world so i can only give you my point of view 

229.19 230.94 A: from what i see 

231.19 231.73 B: mhm 

231.83 234.81 A: as far as the information that i get from them 

235.49 236.72 A: um 

248.67 249.35 A: gave you 

249.79 254.75 A: and uh build from that so it is a two way relationship from that really 

255.45 255.94 B: right 

255.90 258.43 A: teachers can't do it all themselves 

258.70 259.29 B: no 

260.60 263.17 B: do you think that uh because your 

263.55 265.32 B: uh nieces are so 

265.42 267.08 B: smart that they are getting 

266.57 269.10 A: n- i didn't say they are so smart they are not gifted 

269.46 271.88 A: but there are children that 

269.66 270.57 B: okay 

270.88 273.87 B: they have to study for everything they get right 

284.97 285.70 A: that's true 

292.65 295.93 A: at the elementary school level i didn't hear of 

296.09 304.08 A: children who were in gifted programs some thirty years ago forty years ago but not at least not in my area in toronto 

304.40 304.98 B: mhm 

304.82 311.62 A: but nowadays i'm finding and hearing so many children that are in gifted programs 

311.89 312.29 B: sure 

312.51 316.89 A: and uh they are getting a different level of work than the norm 

317.60 322.76 A: um which is a very good thing it stimulates them it keeps them at different levels 

324.00 325.03 A: ach 

324.78 327.60 B: now how many uh students are in their class 

328.13 332.67 A: um classes are small um i 

333.05 339.75 A: really don't know i can't comment on how small but i do remember my sister saying that 

340.13 347.39 A: well this is a matter of opinion of whether you think it is a small class or not but i think it is something like fifteen twenty 

347.81 349.34 A: students per class 

349.37 350.55 B: oh that is small 

351.10 357.93 B: i'm really surprised that they haven't um wanted to consolidate that's what we are running into in my area 

351.19 351.46 A: hm 

357.59 360.81 A: why how many students per class in your area 

360.53 361.42 B: um 

361.97 363.75 B: well there's probably 

364.61 366.91 B: twenty there could be twenty five 

366.78 369.03 A: that is a small difference i don't think that that 

369.34 370.66 A: i mean 

371.33 372.09 A: twenty five 

372.21 376.37 A: twenty uh if you had said forty that would really surprise me 

376.78 377.25 B: uh-huh 

377.70 382.27 B: no they are so small that um they are consolidating with uh 

382.36 383.91 B: other schools and 

385.47 388.59 B: there will probably be in the near future 

388.71 392.56 B: i would say within the next two years there will be approximately 

393.31 398.20 B: uh three school districts probably going together for one big school 

397.89 402.41 A: i i i would hate to see that happen um it it's 

402.51 405.13 A: i remember when i was um 

416.44 416.73 A: small 

422.34 424.27 A: and you go to um 

425.14 427.55 A: uh from junior high to high school 

427.87 429.48 A: or secondary school as we call it 

429.63 430.06 A: canada 

430.37 433.34 A: and it gets larger still i think we had a student body of 

434.01 435.66 A: two thousand then 

435.92 438.33 A: um and we thought that was large 

439.27 440.43 A: this was of course 

440.74 441.14 A: some 

441.31 451.39 A: thirty years ago um i'm hearing schools uh nowadays having have student bodies or student populations of five thousand and i think that is rather large 

442.64 443.13 B: uh-huh 

452.51 453.66 B: yes i do too 

454.12 455.98 B: i grew up around the small 

456.54 459.24 B: school district as a matter of fact i went to country school 

459.91 463.00 A: oh i think you would get a lot of attention in that way 

460.68 461.35 B: and 

464.83 466.20 B: yeah i 

466.35 469.43 B: i i did i got quite a bit of at- of attention 

470.99 473.65 B: but what i'm finding around here that um 

474.24 477.81 B: they are laying off a lot of the teachers now and 

478.42 480.45 B: that is what happening around you too 

481.65 485.23 A: in my area like i said i'm not a parent 

485.82 493.76 A: so i don't keep my ears tuned to that area i don't really listen and or pay attention to that um 

494.11 503.53 A: uh florida is not exactly an academically strong state so i really don't pay attention i i i um 

504.33 506.87 A: i don't really know how the system 

507.31 508.76 A: measures up in florida 

514.90 516.51 A: same as they were when i was 

517.54 520.45 A: very fortunate to have available at 

520.98 523.23 A: my ti- in my time uh
