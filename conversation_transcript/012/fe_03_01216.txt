18.32 19.55 A: yes 

19.23 22.54 B: um what are your [sigh] opinions on that 

21.87 25.47 A: i think our public school system is uh defunct 

25.16 26.27 B: mhm 

25.65 31.36 A: i think it it's a failure i think it's obsolete in dire trouble 

30.94 33.03 B: i i couldn't agree more i 

33.09 45.39 B: i think that there's too many kids that are passed along the system and they should not be passed from one grade to the next um they just you know they they don't want to hold them back so and they don't want to deal with them again so they pass them right on for one thing 

45.03 45.98 A: yes 

45.42 47.03 B: that's one major issue 

46.67 47.62 A: yes 

47.23 51.16 B: um teachers need to be held more accountable for you know 

51.23 56.40 B: the grades not being um you know changed to something they shouldn't be 

55.99 56.90 A: (( true )) 

57.11 63.58 A: yes well i have dealt with this situation uh several years ago i home school 

63.49 64.43 B: mhm 

64.08 70.04 A: and um i have i agree with you there that the public schools are are are um 

71.01 85.26 A: um in serious trouble because of what what you just said but i i uh i am a christian and and i don't really have a strong issue about prayer in school but i do i do think it's rather disingenuous to try to 

85.43 98.41 A: um promote strictly a humanistic secular view while while we are still taxpayers and supporters of the system too and we deserve at least equal opportunities to our views 

96.54 97.36 B: i 

97.84 109.37 B: i couldn't agree more i'm a christian too and i have that exact opinion on it [laughter] a- as a matter of fact it's funny this is the topic um today on a bulletin board i just posted my opinion on that exact subject how i feel like you 

101.72 102.53 A: (( yeah )) 

109.14 116.89 B: know even our country in general how they're wanting to take god out of it when we're we're founded on god you know they have to understand he he has to be part of it 

112.38 113.26 A: (( yeah )) 

114.05 115.05 A: yes 

116.48 117.77 A: yes 

116.88 129.47 B: and the more that they take him out of it in the schools and so forth and and yet yet they talk about evolution and and act like you know that's the the way it is and they don't they won't let creation be part of the teaching even 

120.42 122.13 A: the more trouble we have 

129.13 131.58 A: well they cannot prove evolution 

131.31 132.54 B: exactly 

131.60 134.64 A: and that's their same argument for creationism 

133.97 140.38 B: yes that's the thing you know it's i think the least they could do is at least involve both of them in the in the schools 

135.49 136.95 A: it's a theory 

139.30 148.81 A: well they should be genuine about their their uh open mindedness and yes and and let the kids or the people uh make their own decisions 

142.77 144.12 B: exactly 

148.73 150.26 B: exactly 

149.50 150.72 A: exactly 

150.40 153.16 B: rather than pushing their you know their views on 

152.46 158.35 A: yeah i believe the home schools uh home school is is a it's growing tremendously 

157.90 159.13 B: mhm 

158.46 159.41 A: um 

159.57 169.14 A: because of this what we're talking about and it's not just a a religious type uh s- situation any more it's becoming a very popular alternative for 

169.18 175.16 A: for um all levels of of people um the secular as well as as the religious 

171.71 172.62 B: mhm 

175.03 187.59 B: exactly i i think one [mn] one thing you know p- i'm not a parent but you know i have nieces and nephews in the sy- school systems and i can definitely relate with you know my brother and sister in law telling me what they go through within 

175.69 176.81 A: and um 

182.20 182.99 A: mhm 

187.48 200.31 B: uh just from my own experiences with it in my school years and um you know i know the violence even you know that's gotten so far out of hand now you know with children being able to get away with having guns and you know 

189.36 190.25 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

193.95 194.65 A: (( yes )) 

200.06 208.43 A: yep well the the teachers are not allowed to be teachers maybe maybe you know b- before when i i graduated in nineteen sixty eight 

200.77 202.55 B: it's it's just crazy 

208.55 214.33 A: and uh teachers were allowed to be teachers and they they didn't have to deal greatly with discipline 

214.33 219.44 A: um they were they were teachers and if they had discipline problems they they had um 

214.56 215.72 B: exactly 

219.27 230.66 A: the principals or the the uh school system itself took care of it and that has changed tremendously dramatically so now the teachers don't teach a hundred percent of the time they teach maybe if they're lucky twenty five percent of the time 

222.96 223.91 B: mhm 

230.04 231.30 B: exactly 

230.66 234.50 A: and they always seem to be teaching to the least common denominator 

233.90 234.87 B: mhm 

234.67 243.15 A: and if you look at statistics that are out there now this this bogus argument that classroom size has any bearing on educational output is ridiculous 

242.78 243.90 B: i agree 

243.70 255.69 A: i'm a strong supporter of vouchers i think vouchers would be the one way that americans could uh be free to vote to show what they really mean there would not be any more discussion because 

255.57 262.65 A: they uh parents would be able to decide and the numbers would show where they really and what they really feel about education 

262.37 265.97 B: i think that's a good idea i haven't heard much about it actually so 

265.74 269.92 A: well vouchers are where you know you take the public money that we pay in for taxes 

266.10 266.86 B: that's 

269.29 270.60 B: mhm 

269.97 282.28 A: and then instead of putting it into a public school system is you you give each parent with students so much of the money like say five thousand dollars a year and then the parents decide where the kid will go to school 

277.57 278.19 B: (( mm )) 

278.68 279.55 B: mhm 

281.82 282.74 B: oh 

282.26 292.91 A: it will be a public school if they wish it could be a private school if they wish [mn] but but you will be responsible for choosing where your child goes to get his primary education it's holding the parents responsible 

292.30 293.71 B: mhm 

293.08 297.35 A: and it's putting tremendous pressure on the public schools to perform 

296.79 300.35 B: oh wow i really love that idea i hadn't heard anything about that so 

299.45 301.13 A: well that's a pretty big issue 

300.56 303.48 B: i'll have to do some yeah i'll have to do some research on that now 

302.77 306.55 A: yes you will hear that being bantered around more and more now because that's um 

306.68 317.08 A: gonna be one of the big things that come up the public schools are bankrupt in our system here in the city of minneapolis it costs over nine thousand dollars per student per year 

317.10 328.14 A: in the public schools i paid for private school and i got three times the the education for my child for three thousand dollars a year i'd like a six thousand dollar rebate 

318.33 319.21 B: wow 

325.31 326.31 B: wow 

327.57 329.11 B: exactly 

328.42 333.02 A: well now i'm paying taxes [mn] for public school and doing double duty 'cause i do go to some 

333.04 335.86 A: private school and now i home school because 

335.97 346.36 A: my children are my children and they need an education today and in the public schools they were being held hostage and i could not in all good conscience allow that to happen 

338.44 339.89 B: exactly 

346.26 359.70 B: wow that's [laughter] that's for sure at least you know exactly what they are being taught you can control you know you have more control over you know your as far as your beliefs you know not not other beliefs being put on them and 

351.39 352.22 A: mhm 

359.97 362.97 A: well i have an opportunity to be a parent 

362.29 363.72 B: exactly 

363.16 365.93 A: and to be involved and have the input that i 

366.01 378.29 A: uh need and and i should have because now you hear them always saying that the the parent is the problem they need more parental input well i'm putting in everything i have 

367.12 368.06 B: mhm 

377.63 381.53 B: exactly i wish wish there was more people like you i [laughter] really do 

381.00 392.46 A: well [laughter] there are more people like us out there and our voices are starting to be heard because we're starting to get angrier and angrier and we're starting to get more and more political and we're starting to vote more 

383.23 384.19 B: yeah 

385.19 386.12 B: right 

390.01 391.08 B: mhm 

392.63 396.34 A: uh on on really primary issues of this nature 

395.89 402.93 B: that's terrific i know a lot of my friends home school and i think i would if i had children too you know once i do i 

401.80 404.67 A: do you know where home school is growing the fastest 

404.24 405.08 B: which 

405.01 407.21 A: it's growing fastest in japan 

406.96 408.06 B: wow 

407.80 417.38 A: and it's because it's such a wonderful alternative to um traditional education the the resources that are out there now it's incredible 

413.72 414.72 B: mhm 

416.97 417.99 B: wow 

417.86 429.43 A: when you have satellite connections you have uh videos you have c._d.s computers uh you can go on any [mn] any library in the world you can research ya de ya de ya de you can get doctor degrees i mean 

419.93 420.87 B: mhm 

429.45 434.97 A: [mn] the public schools are really obsolete and you're gonna see a huge change 

435.10 440.75 A: in the way primary education is is looked at and taught in in upcoming years 

440.16 446.22 B: yeah i can kind of feel it heading in that direction just you know i think i would know more on the issue if i did have children you know 

445.57 447.51 A: oh you would have to because 

446.67 447.95 B: exactly 

447.68 449.70 A: you would uh you would um 

450.29 452.00 A: you would have no choice 

451.45 455.60 B: exa- well i would want to you know i would want to inform myself more on it [mn] 

452.99 453.71 A: yeah 

454.88 458.11 A: exactly and you would be able to very easily because there's 

457.09 457.97 B: mhm 

458.17 460.56 A: tons and tons of information out there 

459.60 465.86 B: oh absolutely that's one thing the internet's definitely helped us with is having it at our fingertips now 

465.94 471.61 B: more readily available than it was you know prior to having computers in most homes 

468.93 469.92 A: mhm 

470.49 471.23 A: (( yep )) 

471.56 473.70 A: well this is the information age 

473.13 474.45 B: mhm 

473.74 474.55 A: (( and if a [mn] )) 

474.88 478.79 A: ignorant they really have noone but themselves to blame 

478.19 479.14 B: right 

479.38 480.53 B: i agree 

479.92 489.16 A: and i could not stay ignorant and look myself and my maker in in and say that i did the best that i did for my children if i did not do something 

488.13 489.19 B: i agree 

489.42 491.32 A: and it's been a wonderful experience 

492.07 493.53 B: i'm sure it has 

494.30 496.64 A: so i don't know how long we're supposed to talk 

497.01 499.21 B: it seems like it's probably been ten minutes but 

498.65 500.03 A: i hope i don't know 

499.39 501.92 B: i think something's supposed to come on and tell us 

501.57 502.59 A: okay 

502.39 505.59 B: i can um let me look real quick on my phone if it tells what how long it's been 

505.46 506.32 A: okay 

508.44 511.19 B: uh it's been nine and a half so any time now 

510.97 518.88 A: well [cough] i i i'm actually i'm a stay at home dad because of i um i left my job my wife now is out making the bread 

518.87 522.08 A: and i am teaching two boys 

522.00 536.64 A: and my eldest son is thirteen and he goes to a private school for three classes because there are some things i just cannot do well at home like a lab class like he's taking biology and he's gonna be taking chemistry and foreign language i am not good at foreign languages 

528.92 529.89 B: sure 

535.41 536.75 B: mhm 

536.46 542.56 A: so he has that and he and he has all the social activities and all the social 

537.81 539.63 B: right that's a good thing but 

541.95 543.49 B: mhm 

542.63 543.76 A: um 

543.84 546.32 A: input that that he needs 

546.34 552.19 A: um that's an argument that home schoolers are are um lack that's that's bogus 

549.32 551.13 B: yeah i've heard that one 

551.84 553.23 B: it sure is 

552.56 553.78 A: and um 

554.13 558.49 A: my kids are well adjusted and they're happy and i'm a blessed man i get to uh 

558.61 561.98 A: participate in their life the way most fathers never get to 

561.48 563.28 B: oh that is terrific 

562.63 568.06 A: and uh i am very passionate about the public schools uh it- it's i've been 

568.50 569.38 A: um 

569.57 573.54 A: pretty much chomping on the bit for probably seven eight years now 

573.20 574.24 B: mhm 

573.65 577.70 A: and this debate just keeps getting um more steam 

577.68 589.99 A: and uh some places have passed vouchers and there have been tests uh court cases about the validity of [mn] public funds being used for private parochial type schools and that but that that wall is coming down 

577.69 578.70 B: mhm 

587.80 588.89 B: mhm 

589.98 596.25 A: and there is gonna be i think a a national search for people parents to have vouchers 

596.39 597.53 B: great 

596.44 599.90 A: and to make these primary basic decisions about their children
