0.50 1.85 A: hello 

1.16 2.39 B: hi 

2.25 3.97 A: this is joanne 

3.49 4.97 B: this is nadia 

4.72 6.16 A: how are you 

5.68 7.15 B: oh good how are you 

6.82 8.46 A: just fine thank you 

9.06 11.79 B: oh affirmative action hm [noise] 

12.32 21.32 A: well i'm not totally a hundred percent sure i understand how affirmative action works but i do know what the concept is 

21.45 22.43 A: um 

22.95 25.08 A: do you know much about it 

24.35 27.17 B: i think i know like the concept 

26.93 28.18 A: mhm 

27.28 30.59 B: um i i think it's probably maybe two 

31.04 33.90 B: maybe two different ways to look at it perhaps 

33.63 34.83 A: perhaps 

34.25 41.80 B: i know it may be like probably the bad one i've put that quotes is like a quota kind of thing 

41.79 44.55 A: mhm quotas i think can be bad 

42.45 43.16 B: but 

44.40 49.08 B: yeah h- but i think if a if there's a programme in place maybe 

49.24 60.71 B: that just gives opportunities to you know disadvantaged groups and i guess it would just to me it would kind of depend on how the program is um 

53.02 54.54 A: mhm 

60.86 64.06 A: well i think we agree um 

64.59 70.43 A: i i have um i have seen it work quite well sometimes 

71.12 77.17 A: and i have seen ah people who felt that they were being left out unfairly 

76.56 77.53 B: yeah 

77.43 80.74 A: so it's [mn] it is it is 

81.01 84.85 A: probably a programme that needs a little more study 

84.58 86.07 B: yeah 

85.47 87.72 A: so it would work more smoothly 

88.20 93.49 B: yeah do you think that the the needs to be sort of 

94.35 96.01 B: even in a way 

96.17 97.22 B: in a sense 

97.40 100.39 A: of planned i'm sorry i didn't understand [laughter] 

99.96 103.58 B: like leveling a playing field f- for all people do 

103.75 104.66 B: you think 

105.40 108.83 A: well ah to level level the field 

108.36 111.07 B: yeah because i think that's what the the point 

111.00 112.10 A: (( uh-huh )) 

111.79 113.01 B: is 

112.49 114.24 A: that was the point 

113.67 114.97 B: yeah [laughter] 

115.05 117.13 A: yeah um 

117.73 121.51 A: it's been in in effect for quite a long time hasn't it 

120.88 122.80 B: yeah i would think so 

122.81 123.96 B: and i think 

124.50 128.38 B: i i think it's kind of hard to say like is there 

128.39 137.76 B: is like a particular um corporation necessarily have an affirmative action programme you know because i don't think they really did you know 

134.21 135.33 A: mhm 

137.43 139.13 A: some don't i think 

138.75 139.71 B: (( yeah mm )) 

140.10 143.83 A: um i guess we're supposed to decide if it would be a good thing 

144.35 145.89 A: um in 

145.98 150.20 A: in the business community and it could be it could be 

150.46 153.46 B: and how would you think a programme like that could work 

154.13 160.19 A: oh dear [laughter] i i think i would want to get some experts in 

155.02 156.26 B: (( [laughter] mhm mhm )) 

161.03 162.79 A: ah to advise 

163.40 165.02 A: and and ah 

165.43 168.98 A: show the business how it can be done fairly 

168.58 169.57 B: yeah 

169.76 174.97 A: um i'm sure there are such experts in in this world [laughter] 

174.68 175.84 B: (( [laughter] )) 

175.26 178.55 A: maybe even if the university of pennsylvania 

177.68 179.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

178.96 182.40 A: [laughter] but um um 

180.37 181.11 B: (( ah )) 

183.15 190.67 A: i my mind doesn't think along those lines i i'm in show business [laughter] yeah 

188.76 189.93 B: oh yeah 

190.09 190.96 B: uh-huh 

190.74 192.81 A: [laughter] so so um 

193.27 203.48 A: in show business they they have for years and years and years tried t- ah to have more and more and more affirmative action 

203.14 204.25 B: oh yeah 

204.27 209.09 A: and um i know when i first started many many years ago 

209.54 210.55 A: um 

210.56 212.96 A: i was at a television network 

212.56 213.99 B: mhm 

213.40 215.55 A: and the head of the network 

216.20 218.57 A: told all of the executives 

218.90 220.42 A: to start 

220.45 223.57 A: casting minority actors 

223.87 224.82 A: in 

225.29 231.75 A: rol- the roles of heros of doctors of lawyers of this and and we did try 

228.71 229.88 B: yeah 

231.89 232.81 A: um 

232.97 234.81 A: it was a long time 

235.21 239.44 A: before there were a lot of stars but there are a lot of stars now 

239.05 240.30 B: mhm 

241.46 247.10 B: well i think the i think the yeah i mean i think it's a good idea because 

247.25 249.52 B: and i guess i want to say that 

249.72 254.04 B: it's not a good idea to get somebody in there just because of 

253.99 255.00 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

254.19 255.93 B: you know their 

255.02 257.66 A: well if they can't do the job 

257.24 258.63 B: exactly 

258.28 260.55 A: i mean i think i think it's 

260.71 264.83 A: it would soon become apparent if they couldn't do the job [laughter] 

262.70 263.72 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

263.83 265.07 B: yeah yeah 

265.16 266.53 A: but um 

267.29 269.23 A: it's it's um 

269.63 272.29 A: i think it's done more good than bad 

271.71 277.62 B: yeah yeah yeah i think i guess people who you know some opportunities that they wouldn't have 

277.90 280.31 B: (( i don't know had normally mhm )) 

279.62 280.70 A: mhm 

282.25 284.27 B: (( yeah i wonder if um )) 

284.30 289.60 B: (( i don't know if like oh we're just talking about the business world trying to get off the subject )) 

289.65 291.80 B: (( but i was talking about school )) 

291.77 293.15 A: oh yeah 

292.27 297.99 B: it's not i've heard like in the news lately where they're like cutting out those programmes or something 

298.23 299.69 B: and some schools 

299.73 302.33 A: yes i think they already have in some 

303.62 305.08 A: in colleges 

304.65 306.65 B: yeah 

306.20 307.48 A: and um 

308.32 310.62 A: ah i don't think they should cut it out 

310.64 315.41 A: they should they should adapt it to work better if they have a problem 

315.74 317.18 B: yeah 

317.71 319.22 B: i think so too 

320.39 320.99 B: (( [laughter] )) 

321.07 322.00 A: (( well )) 

321.71 323.26 B: what kind of um 

324.01 327.39 B: (( what kind of entertainment are you ah work are doing now )) 

327.79 333.92 A: well well i'm semi retired but i'm teaching television production and writing 

333.73 334.57 B: (( ooh )) 

334.37 336.75 A: yeah in a college 

336.37 338.12 B: okay yeah 

338.20 346.73 A: and um it's a very interesting school it has an international mission we have teachers and students from all over the world 

347.85 349.78 B: really what school is that 

348.50 351.52 A: yeah it's in it's in missouri 

351.74 355.71 A: um you wouldn't expect to find it but it there it is 

354.23 355.37 B: (( mhm )) 

356.24 357.80 B: (( [laughter] uh-huh mhm )) 

357.98 359.87 A: anyway um 

360.96 367.28 A: i i don't know if they have affirmative action or not but i i do know they have many minority students 

368.82 374.07 A: i'll have to find out more about this now i'm getting more interested [laughter] 

373.62 378.41 B: yeah have you done um one of these talks before 

378.52 380.29 A: no this is the first one 

379.89 381.38 B: oh yeah me too 

381.16 382.31 A: oh really 

381.86 383.18 B: yeah [laughter] 

382.38 385.20 A: well i'm glad we're both newcomers [laughter] 

384.46 389.37 B: (( [laughter] because i wonder how it's going to work because we're supposed to like talk for like ten minutes or something )) 

388.87 394.34 A: yeah they'll they'll um a voice will come on and tell us okay it's time to stop 

393.87 394.99 B: oh 

394.69 397.68 A: i i that's what i understand anyway 

398.59 402.36 A: because so i mean we we're not timing it ourselves 

401.78 402.88 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

403.07 405.10 A: so ten minutes we 

405.63 407.54 A: seems quite long sometimes 

407.14 409.69 B: yeah [laughter] 

409.01 411.77 A: [laughter] but um 

412.82 413.70 A: do you 

414.39 415.90 A: what do you think 

416.40 423.73 A: how could they handle it if they had someone in the affirmative action programme who was doing bad work 

423.47 424.79 B: (( mm )) 

425.22 427.61 A: they must have the company rules 

426.94 430.44 B: yeah yeah you know i think it's just kind of 

431.68 439.21 B: why probably it's such a hot topic or sticky is because it's not it's just kind of um 

435.45 436.83 A: (( mhm )) 

439.73 443.89 B: because it it touches on larger issues of our society you know 

443.03 444.52 A: yes it does 

443.99 445.17 B: um 

445.92 447.49 B: and so i think that 

448.20 454.71 B: you know while we kind of talk about issues of race and um maybe racism and stuff 

455.81 459.03 B: you know you know in this country we don't really 

459.06 460.25 B: um 

461.25 463.42 B: talk about it maybe 

463.88 467.38 B: that it that it's real you know what i mean that 

466.01 467.04 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

468.26 471.71 A: um it used to be discussed much more openly 

468.40 469.79 B: these things still 

471.37 472.65 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

472.84 474.22 A: and um 

474.85 476.38 A: our society 

476.45 479.29 A: of course is constantly changing and 

480.06 483.04 A: and i we're far ahead of wh- of where we were 

483.18 484.15 A: um 

484.43 485.80 A: when i was born 

485.45 486.31 B: uh-huh 

487.90 490.60 A: so that that is 

491.12 492.83 A: the positive side 

494.64 495.81 B: (( yeah indeed )) 

497.01 501.00 B: yeah you know actually i think that our i have a um law degree 

500.74 501.89 A: oh you do mhm 

501.44 508.50 B: yeah and so i think i don't know if the school that i went to had a affirmative action program or not but 

508.56 509.74 B: um 

509.17 510.73 A: you didn't need one 

510.67 511.95 B: [laughter] 

512.31 513.60 B: (( ah )) 

514.42 519.09 B: (( yeah it was hard to say so i don't know if i was a product of affirmative action )) 

519.29 520.12 B: um 

520.35 522.49 B: (( personally you know [laughter] i don't )) 

521.64 525.30 A: right well if if you were i think you would know it wouldn't you 

527.73 528.62 A: i mean 

529.03 533.09 B: (( know you know actually i think that um )) 

534.54 543.44 B: [mn] you know i think that what they do maybe in schools is instead of maybe they use different factor 

543.28 544.51 A: mhm 

543.54 548.37 B: instead of perhaps just you know a grade or on a test or something 

548.08 549.14 A: (( right mhm )) 

548.42 550.88 B: so maybe they look at like um 

551.15 558.36 B: you know like different life experience or different activities maybe that you engaged in in school 

558.13 559.31 A: right 

558.71 559.72 B: (( um )) 

559.76 561.30 B: and that sort of thing 

561.88 564.60 B: so i think that um [mn] 

565.27 566.74 B: so i think that if 

566.89 575.14 B: you know because people come from different experiences um you know maybe standardized testing wouldn't um 

570.62 571.60 A: true 

576.18 577.66 B: would kind of be s- 

579.21 580.32 B: um 

581.21 587.46 B: i guess what i'm trying to say is i think they had i had read something about like a study about the s._a._t.s 

587.20 588.32 A: (( mhm )) 

587.65 597.94 B: and how like minorities maybe score lower and then they kind of listed the kind of questions that they asked as far as like you know in that part where you have to like um 

598.10 599.95 B: somethings to something and
