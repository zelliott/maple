18.49 19.04 A: (( i )) 

31.73 33.42 A: (( very rare i get the sunday paper )) 

33.14 35.44 B: through those two sources 

34.41 44.51 A: (( but i don't i don't often even have time to take a look at it when i do get it but um i found that uh a lot of times you know it seems like the internet a lot of times you get news actually faster so and it is convenient because you can just pull it up quickly and read through it as opposed to waiting one of the channels )) 

36.10 37.67 B: [laughter] 

44.82 50.64 A: (( i watch is c._n._n. and you know [noise] it repeats every thirty minutes so you do get you know the whole feel )) 

51.06 55.03 A: (( kinda in thirty minutes so that kinda makes it a little easier to get you know as much information as )) 

54.91 70.06 B: (( [noise] )) 

55.78 56.95 A: (( possible )) 

70.06 70.62 B: (( yeah )) 

72.26 73.13 B: (( there's )) 

74.01 77.45 A: yeah this is true um i watch 

77.71 82.87 A: especially as of late c._n._n. and m._s._n._b._c. and uh 

83.71 86.49 A: i don't i kinda go back and forth between 'em 

86.88 88.38 A: but uh 

88.86 90.20 B: sure a lot of stuff 

89.22 90.25 A: they never w- 

90.44 91.94 A: i'm sorry 

90.99 92.94 B: i'm sorry go ahead [laughter] 

92.11 92.68 A: (( a- )) 

93.53 99.20 A: and a lot of times e- especially as of late i it's 

99.16 113.78 A: it gets a little bit too repetitive that's the only bad thing about it so then i just i just say okay it's enough for now and we'll go turn it off [mn] and come back and you know listen to it later but 

103.49 104.81 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

112.35 118.51 B: yeah see what else is is they've updated on [noise] there is sure a lot of stuff going on right now with the war 

115.85 117.69 A: (( yeah )) 

118.93 121.64 A: that there is and [sigh] 

119.84 123.00 B: [laughter] [noise] sure a lot of information out there 

123.20 128.11 A: and it's just i don't know it there is sometimes it's almost an overload 

127.68 128.95 B: mhm 

128.61 143.47 A: and i've found that i've just you know it's like enough no more for a while just turn everything off i don't even want it on for noise i just turn it off and let it go for a while it's like i'll catch up later 

137.90 139.21 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

141.33 142.47 B: yeah 

142.88 144.83 B: [laughter] definitely 

145.06 153.03 B: yeah but um it's kinda interesting how they're doing the coverage with the war and the journalists being right in there on the front line 

145.37 146.64 A: (( but )) 

153.11 157.75 B: i think it's kinda interesting getting to see an insider view i guess 

157.80 161.05 A: yeah it that is kinda interesting it's 

161.47 166.46 A: it's not k- i i don't know if i'd wanna do it i'd if i were them or not [laughter] 

165.14 172.46 B: that'd be a little scary yeah i think and and sometimes it is a little bit too graphic [laughter] what we're getting to see 

167.17 172.42 A: be a lot scary to me um yeah 

172.68 178.99 A: yeah because they obviously they take out you know a bunch of it i'm sure 

177.64 178.80 B: uh-huh 

179.45 186.21 A: but it was it was rather interesting i didn't realize that some of the bombs that they're using 

186.37 191.89 A: can i i knew they could be precise but i didn't realize they could be that precise 

193.00 194.13 A: it was 

194.43 199.63 A: um the ones they're they use what is it la- they're using laser and um 

195.58 196.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

199.64 201.66 A: they've got it in the cars 

201.03 202.29 B: uh-huh 

201.84 203.72 A: the g._p._s. i couldn't think of it 

202.67 204.68 B: yeah the g._p._s. yeah 

204.78 207.20 B: it's amazing how accurate they can be 

208.24 209.04 B: but 

208.24 210.43 A: get within feet i guess 

209.76 224.23 B: mhm and all those [sigh] i just it amazes me that the journalists can be where they're at and just through satellite and and the technology that's out there how that's able to be broadcasted back to us 

224.33 231.56 B: it i think it's kind of amazing just the technology of the whole [sigh] news [laughter] i guess 

230.92 234.03 A: yes it is um i k- 

234.52 243.18 A: now i've gotten kinda interested it that and it also makes you realize that you know the time differences 

242.40 247.72 B: mhm yeah it is interesting that you're seeing it nighttime there and 

245.10 246.15 A: i 

247.11 255.13 A: it it's in the middle of the afternoon it's in the middle of the night there um i mean n- you know that they're different times it's just 

248.91 249.92 B: uh-huh 

250.37 251.75 B: (( yeah )) 

255.28 260.01 A: you i guess you just forget about it or don't don't pay any attention 

257.26 259.62 B: mhm yeah 

259.75 264.05 B: you do kinda i i'm actually originally from new zealand so i kinda 

263.64 265.21 A: oh really 

263.98 278.80 B: can relate a little bit to that because um when i all my relatives live back there except for my immediate family so when we you know call and stuff you've gotta really think about what time of the day it is for them [noise] so you're not waking them up in the middle of the night 

278.92 282.13 B: so you know can kind of relate to that a little bit 

279.76 281.44 A: yeah 

282.42 296.24 A: well i've got some friends i [sigh] i i play some games online every once in a while and uh they play for they can you know they're for people from all over the world and i 

296.36 302.57 A: they're going well good morning and it's like ah no ah this is kinda late at night 

299.70 300.60 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

302.61 312.53 A: and then we have you know well where are you and then we get going back and forth oh okay so you're not you're not here [laughter] 

311.39 313.21 B: mhm 

312.89 316.88 A: but it is it is kinda interesting 

313.79 315.52 B: i know it's very interesting 

316.00 326.77 B: it is it's it's neat to kinda think of what somebody else is doing at that time of the day because you know they could be sleeping or you know it's just totally different circumstance for them 

327.25 328.94 A: yeah and 

329.02 333.13 A: um one of my friends is from brazil 

332.84 334.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

334.04 338.28 A: and so not only is there the time difference isn't so much 

338.23 339.19 B: [noise] 

338.59 340.99 A: but the um 

341.15 342.46 A: the seasons 

342.29 343.75 B: mhm 

343.13 344.97 A: all of that you know and 

344.37 358.33 B: exactly for us growing up in new zealand it was summer at christmastime [noise] and uh coming here mhm uh you know it's a whole different thing to have a white christmas so that was kinda interesting it it's kinda neat [noise] 

356.90 358.33 A: boy did we 

359.81 361.77 A: (( yeah )) 

360.56 362.22 B: [laughter] 

362.16 367.74 A: i imagine it is and sounds like you've got some young ones so they got to 

365.79 366.96 B: yes 

368.15 372.05 A: they got to enjoy some some of the white christmas too i imagine 

370.00 371.02 B: [noise] 

371.49 375.41 B: yes they both have their first christmas had a white christmas 

372.73 374.67 A: [laughter] 

376.67 380.29 B: (( they're keeping me busy [laughter] press the button there you go )) 

379.30 383.84 A: [sigh] i understand that very well very well mine's 

380.35 381.64 B: [laughter] 

382.12 383.78 B: do you have children

395.97 398.38 A: yeah they at that age they 

399.29 402.60 A: they're grown up they don't wanna be bothered with us [laughter] but 

401.68 406.45 B: [laughter] starting to get pretty independent i'm sure [noise] 

406.12 408.11 A: yeah and 

408.32 412.06 A: in fact the other day he had i forgot what he was 

412.72 418.51 A: what he was he was looking up something on the compu- you know on the computer and 

418.94 423.69 A: he sent me a link to a couple of si- of websites 

423.78 425.25 A: you know that had like cu- 

425.38 435.91 A: i guess like current events something like that on 'em that i hadn't even you know i usually deal with going to you know m._s._n._b._c. or or something like that but he 

426.76 427.85 B: mhm 

435.94 436.79 A: he 

436.96 442.54 A: showed me another one which offered a totally different point of view and i thought well that's 

442.55 443.40 B: hm 

442.63 446.34 A: kind of i thought at first i thought well that's kinda weird but 

446.36 451.73 A: then i got i stopped and thought about it and then it's like wait a minute this is you know 

446.40 447.07 B: well 

452.18 454.61 A: actually it's kinda neat that 

453.56 454.83 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

454.71 455.89 A: that they're 

456.06 462.31 A: that they're doing that some p- you know [sigh] i've seen a bunch of websites though that have got cad- you know 

462.46 466.68 A: all condemning the war i'm not real impressed with it 

467.15 468.90 A: per se but 

468.10 469.68 B: mhm 

469.81 473.00 A: they i guess they need they need to stop him 

472.16 483.26 B: yeah i mean something needs to be done and [mn] well now these people protesting i it's really not helping anything you know because it's not gonna stop the war it's already 

473.20 474.55 A: (( and [sigh] )) 

480.86 481.79 A: no 

483.54 490.30 B: in place and something has to be done it's not like we can just quit you know then we there'll be a lot more terrorist stuff so 

490.42 494.76 B: they need to may- maybe just focus on the fact that our 

494.99 500.60 B: troops need support you know because it has happened and we kinda have to get behind them 

500.45 503.72 A: it's not gonna i it's not gonna go away 

503.29 504.78 B: yeah exactly 

504.90 508.09 A: i mean it's not gonna go away till he goes away 

507.49 509.01 B: mhm 

508.30 510.84 A: and unfortunately 

510.87 511.62 A: [sigh] 

512.28 513.77 A: it kinda you know 

514.61 516.57 A: he's been so un- he 

516.90 520.34 A: he's been so uncooperative and 

519.04 520.28 B: mhm 

520.47 524.14 A: deceitful or it seem like seems like it to me 

524.23 534.86 A: and [sigh] it's not gonna stop you know until they until they find him and either either they'll kill him or 

530.70 531.73 B: yeah 

532.60 533.16 B: (( [noise] )) 

535.84 537.45 A: [mn] you know they'll 

537.94 541.88 A: hope maybe they'll put him in prison not that it'll do any good 

540.98 552.53 B: [laughter] yeah d- so have they found out any more i haven't really seen anything lately on the fact of whether they kinda have any idea of his location or anything 

553.32 554.58 B: obviously did 

553.54 554.35 A: (( [noise] )) 

554.90 556.21 B: do they feel like they 

554.91 556.47 A: well i don't know 

556.46 557.25 B: no 

557.35 561.83 A: i haven't i haven't heard anything as of you know whether they found you know 

562.76 572.99 B: because originally they had thought maybe you know they did get his the target of where he was which was [noise] really unbelievable because i thought there's no way that he's gonna 

563.13 564.60 A: found him or 

573.22 577.52 B: he's gonna hide i mean he's been hiding all this time there's no way that 

577.81 587.64 B: it would just be so unbelievable that they could find him that easily and be able to take him out as quickly as you know it was originally kinda talked about uh-huh 

587.23 596.65 A: well i guess maybe they've got spies too just like us i mean we've got spies in every i mean in different places i guess they can too but 

590.82 592.08 B: [laughter] 

594.66 595.68 B: uh-huh 

596.08 597.32 B: yeah 

598.01 599.89 B: that'd be great though if they could just
