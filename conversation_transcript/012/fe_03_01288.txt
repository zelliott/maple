47.21 49.53 A: um pretty much exclusively the internet i'm 

49.94 52.15 A: very allergic to television i've never liked 

52.40 53.05 A: television 

53.58 54.18 B: oh yeah 

54.24 59.21 A: oh man i have a fairly the libraries down where i am now are not especially good so it's 

59.59 60.62 A: absolutely internet 

61.33 61.82 B: yeah 

61.35 64.39 A: i i o- oddly enough i was just thinking about this topic today 

65.01 65.55 B: oh really 

65.07 71.94 A: um i was thinking about when i do talk to people they all seem to be getting their sources just from local 

72.47 76.30 A: you know american sources and seem very ill-informed by my standard 

75.85 76.39 B: yeah 

76.97 79.23 B: yeah especially a topic with uh 

79.37 80.51 B: war and everything 

81.43 83.75 B: i think everyone is more involved with 

84.83 90.66 B: current events than they usually are you know what i mean or trying to watching news more on t._v. and 

89.80 90.46 A: yeah yeah 

90.83 91.09 A: yeah 

91.14 91.66 B: which 

92.00 94.45 B: i think then of course you're going to get the 

94.73 96.48 B: senstationalization of 

96.79 97.53 B: all the 

98.25 100.44 B: you know news networks trying to 

99.91 100.26 A: yeah 

100.55 102.24 B: get the latest information and 

102.42 105.12 A: one thing that really struck me is how before 

105.62 106.02 A: the 

106.28 109.86 A: troops were officially committed before you know it was officially a war 

110.32 112.77 A: it seemed like there was a broader range of 

113.24 113.87 A: um 

114.28 118.57 A: international views available to america through the fairly standard media 

119.19 119.89 A: and then once 

119.47 119.90 B: right 

120.07 122.14 A: once bombs started exploding it was 

122.26 123.77 A: it seemed to really narrow 

122.43 122.79 B: huh 

124.53 125.05 B: yeah 

125.52 127.81 B: that's true the only the only thing you see is 

125.53 125.92 A: um 

128.50 128.95 B: kind of 

129.31 131.66 B: our government's view on the situation 

131.89 132.81 B: more so 

134.12 134.52 A: yeah 

134.30 138.26 B: what's going on unless that's a good thing with the internet i think you can get a more 

139.00 141.41 B: broad range and maybe a little bit more factual and 

142.47 144.52 B: broad range of what's going on it think 

144.74 145.03 A: yeah 

145.14 145.57 A: for sure 

145.95 146.57 B: but 

145.97 148.07 A: are you where are you geographically 

148.95 149.92 B: um i'm in 

150.36 152.20 B: iowa i go to university of iowa 

152.10 152.81 A: uh-huh 

153.32 154.39 B: where are you at 

154.56 156.62 A: well it's sting i'm i'm down in 

157.11 158.84 A: um south louisiana 

159.48 160.11 B: okay 

159.99 162.04 A: um i grew up in the 

162.14 163.63 A: washington d._c. area 

164.46 164.95 A: so 

165.33 166.66 A: those i think the two 

166.82 167.89 A: dreams of 

168.59 171.74 A: politically aware internationally attuned america 

172.17 172.80 A: and 

173.06 176.23 A: you know with all respect kind of a more provincial 

176.67 178.18 A: um limited outlook 

178.81 179.30 B: yeah 

178.94 182.75 A: so so i'm quite aware of that distance but in the intervening 

183.33 185.96 A: quarter century or so i lived outside of the united states 

186.57 187.27 B: oh really 

186.63 188.71 A: so it's you know it's it's a somewhat 

189.21 195.17 A: uh uh my my view of everything and my exposure is very much more international because i haven't actually lived in this country for 

195.67 196.48 A: quite a long time 

196.87 197.52 B: right 

198.54 200.42 B: yeah my roommate um 

200.64 202.90 B: used to live over seas and 

203.28 203.73 B: so 

204.14 207.12 B: that's the only one i've known that hasn't grown up in 

207.26 208.22 B: the united states 

208.01 208.99 A: uh-huh yeah uh-huh 

208.40 209.02 B: so 

209.13 209.52 B: it's 

209.62 212.54 B: sting hearing different views from that you know just 

213.10 214.45 B: their perspective on it is 

214.67 217.28 B: often times things that i haven't always thought of you know 

217.41 217.71 A: yeah 

218.70 219.04 A: but 

218.77 219.28 B: (( )) 

219.40 221.52 A: internet is relatively recent 

221.81 223.02 A: i don't know how old you are 

223.32 225.75 A: but are are you did you grow up as a 

225.97 230.12 A: informed by the internet or is or were you first a print media or television person 

230.65 231.79 B: um i 

232.37 236.19 B: i'd say i started out as a television person although 

236.39 236.94 B: um 

237.22 238.22 B: i'm not real (( i'm just )) 

238.50 239.79 B: nineteen now 

239.67 240.28 A: uh-huh 

240.50 241.07 B: and 

240.53 240.84 A: huh 

241.47 242.05 B: um 

241.75 243.64 A: so internet and you grew up together 

244.12 246.60 B: yeah it pretty much exactly but um 

246.88 247.61 B: so of course 

248.18 248.77 B: um 

249.26 252.96 B: when i was younger then it was just kind of getting started up and stuff and 

253.27 256.91 B: didn't have it but on the other hand i was younger so i didn't care about 

256.53 257.25 A: right right 

257.43 260.82 B: event you know i was just caring about what was going on in my life you know 

260.12 260.50 A: uh-huh 

260.92 263.11 B: but as i became more interested i'd say 

263.51 263.90 B: it was 

264.67 268.31 B: maybe beginning internet starting to watch the news a little bit and then 

268.69 271.09 B: i'd say pretty quickly moved over to the internet and 

271.14 271.46 A: uh-huh 

272.86 276.36 B: especially now living on campus where everybody has got a 

276.65 279.27 B: you know ethernet connection to the networks 

278.20 278.45 A: sure 

279.54 280.62 B: super fast and 

281.50 283.32 A: are most of the people you know there 

283.72 284.36 A: from iowa 

285.32 285.85 B: um 

286.03 289.08 B: a lot of iowa and illinois actually because we're 

289.18 289.61 A: uh-huh 

289.78 291.82 B: on in eastern iowa so 

291.90 292.23 A: uh-huh 

293.05 293.76 B: that's there 

293.94 296.46 B: but i would say the majority of the of the campus is 

297.22 297.63 A: uh-huh 

297.91 302.60 A: uh i don't i'm not really familiar with that part of the country but is isn't there a lot of military bases and stuff 

303.10 304.52 B: um there's 

305.36 306.67 B: not not 

306.91 308.80 B: really at all from what i can tell um 

309.13 310.43 B: where i'm from which is 

310.61 311.10 B: um 

311.21 312.19 B: still in iowa (( )) 

313.24 315.88 B: right next to nebraska is where i'm from and 

315.49 315.81 A: uh-huh 

316.59 319.97 B: so i there's like a (( )) air force base and 

320.19 321.80 B: um omaha that 

322.46 325.08 B: you know i'm familiar with but outside of that 

325.47 326.60 B: right there there's 

326.80 328.95 B: really nothing that i know of so 

328.51 328.94 A: uh-huh 

330.12 331.57 A: because this area down here 

331.76 333.12 A: i think has a fairly 

334.00 335.76 A: the uh the military plays a big role 

336.19 338.01 A: uh i don't think a lot of people here 

338.33 340.24 A: get a lot of education and 

340.85 344.81 A: get into the larger world and those that do it's either through the oil industry 

345.29 346.72 A: or through the military 

345.42 345.91 B: yeah 

347.32 348.36 A: um so i think 

349.19 352.86 A: i as i say i haven't really talked to a lot of people around here but i suspect that that 

353.23 355.72 A: those two perspectives inform their view of 

355.94 356.79 A: world affairs 

357.29 358.15 A: and in this case 

358.26 359.06 A: you know that's a pretty 

359.34 360.45 A: potent combination 

361.25 361.80 B: yeah 

362.07 362.72 B: definitely 

362.74 364.63 A: now this is the big off shore you know 

365.01 367.66 A: that that's what they do down here the main things the off shore 

367.86 368.27 A: oil 

368.96 369.46 B: yeah 

370.51 370.92 B: see 

371.21 371.74 B: um 

372.25 373.96 B: on campus i have a feeling a lot of 

374.84 378.80 B: a lot of people don't really have strong opinion one way or the other you unless 

379.28 380.41 B: unless they're 

381.27 385.78 B: uh the type of person you know who was more into politics or something (( )) but 

384.84 385.39 A: uh-huh 

385.89 387.55 B: i'd say the majority of the 

388.43 390.61 B: student body is just kind of maybe 

391.11 394.65 B: they're friend thinks one way so they kind of you know are just uh 

394.80 399.06 B: it doesn't if it's not effecting their life a whole lot which they don't think it is then they're not really 

396.62 397.03 A: uh-huh 

397.33 397.67 A: uh-huh 

398.51 398.91 A: uh-huh 

399.50 400.39 B: tuned into it 

400.48 403.46 A: uh-huh there aren't any groups of kids with some kind of 

403.96 406.27 A: particular perspective or commitment about it 

406.23 407.64 B: uh there there are 

407.83 409.15 B: there are the 

409.64 412.25 B: you know the two sides we've had you know 

412.38 416.01 B: on campus there's the anti-war rallies we've had and we've had 

416.49 418.51 B: had those that supporting 

418.79 422.52 B: bush and you know his decision and everything but um 

422.68 424.03 B: i'd say those are 

424.48 427.14 B: relatively small compared to the student body 

427.18 427.55 A: uh-huh 

427.75 430.47 B: and i think that the majority of it is just kind of 

430.82 432.91 B: more in a neutral zone they might have 

433.24 437.14 B: they might lean one way or the other but not really enough to speak up about it or 

437.16 437.52 A: uh-huh 

437.74 438.32 B: you know 

438.64 439.30 A: just as of 

439.00 440.16 B: oppose someone's view 

439.55 442.78 A: as an index of my ignorance i don't know eh did iowa 

443.49 444.89 A: vote republican or democrat 

445.92 446.57 A: as a state 

446.32 446.64 B: uh 

447.85 450.12 B: they're generally democrat 

450.28 450.78 A: uh-huh 

450.90 452.52 A: uh-huh so you're senators are democrat 

452.99 453.37 B: yes 

455.86 459.11 A: this is a shameful thing for an adult american not to know (( but i don't know )) 

463.46 464.00 A: uh-huh 

464.42 466.90 A: so so it's not it's not the heartland of of 

464.75 465.10 B: (( some )) 

467.05 468.27 A: republican support 

469.33 470.20 B: no 

470.15 471.38 A: so so bush has to 

471.66 474.28 A: convince the people there they're not automatically going to say 

474.77 476.47 A: we we're we're with you we believe you 

476.66 478.60 B: right exactly i think he has more 

477.69 478.04 A: uh-huh 

480.03 483.56 A: uh-huh is is there much of a muslim population on your campus 

480.38 480.94 B: what 

484.25 484.99 B: much of the what 

485.06 486.72 A: uh are there many muslim students 

487.64 491.01 B: um no i there was actually an article in the 

491.44 491.99 B: um 

492.40 494.53 B: you know in the local newspaper about um 

494.91 496.67 B: a pair of twins but 

497.17 502.50 B: um i and i have actually seen i had both of them in one of my classes oddly enough but 

502.74 503.74 B: um outside of 

503.89 505.21 B: those twins i haven't 

505.82 508.24 B: seen really anyone outside of them so 

508.40 508.75 A: wow 

508.70 510.16 B: i have a feeling it's pretty small 

510.16 510.54 A: uh-huh 

510.82 512.28 A: how about jewish population 

512.54 516.27 B: um we we do have i'd say quite a few yeah i mean it's 

517.31 517.96 B: we have a 

518.16 520.34 B: pretty good range of 

521.19 522.64 B: i think they um 

522.76 523.28 B: (( try and )) 

523.45 525.94 B: you know they try and get people from 

526.50 529.32 B: all over you know to get a diverse student body but 

528.04 528.39 A: uh-huh 

528.67 528.96 A: uh-huh 

531.97 532.55 B: (( ))
