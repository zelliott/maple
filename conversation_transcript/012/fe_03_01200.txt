47.79 48.35 A: (( [cough] )) 

50.41 55.80 B: and wh- if you have if if you have a best friend um that'd be tough to do 

56.07 64.10 B: for a million that means you would never ever be able to share your life or what's going on in your life or you know things together again 

66.05 70.97 A: well haven't you had a lot of good friends that you have like moved away from 

71.17 72.97 A: you know that uh 

73.05 76.91 A: that uh you probably never communicated with again 

75.66 84.32 B: [noise] [mn] [noise] yeah but i can't can't uh the ones that i have i can't say that i they weren't i mean they were not what i would call a good friend 

84.04 86.56 A: uh-huh this is best 

84.56 93.34 B: you know i mean i've i've got a best friend in california but i wouldn't even consider her a best friend but we're good friends and we still communicate

93.97 95.09 A: (( oh yeah )) 

94.71 95.83 B: (( so )) 

95.84 97.47 A: but if you 

96.04 98.97 B: um yeah that'd be that's tough 

98.47 100.19 A: (( it is yeah i know )) 

99.41 103.76 B: yeah 'cause like i said i i could really use that that million dollars right now 

103.72 105.53 A: that'd go a long way wouldn't it 

104.77 109.84 B: yeah it sure would but i don't think i i don't think i could hold up my my part of the bargain 

106.50 108.29 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

111.20 112.12 B: you know 

111.36 113.60 A: uh [mn] i got my dog's

117.36 118.89 A: yeah okay 

119.17 120.65 A: (( um )) 

120.74 130.42 A: um well i read the uh the question the other day when i was looking through them and i thought uh well let's see i think i would probably accept the [laughter] million dollars 

129.98 131.60 B: yeah yeah 

131.44 132.53 A: um 

133.57 136.46 A: uh like i said before i guess uh 

136.91 142.88 A: uh well i shouldn't say money is more important than good friends 

142.44 143.78 B: right right y- 

142.93 146.47 A: you know but i think i could probably find some other 

146.72 150.82 A: good friends this said best friends i believe that was the way it was worded 

150.26 152.98 B: right it definitely said best friend 

152.33 154.15 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

153.75 154.76 B: so 

154.40 160.83 A: and may- maybe i feel that way because i don't really have any best friends you know 

160.09 163.19 B: yeah well that's yeah if i didn't have this best 

162.24 164.25 A: i have a lot of good friends you 

163.85 165.02 B: yeah 

164.28 168.84 A: know but but not a a particularly good friend a best friend 

168.51 170.03 B: best friend 

169.26 170.46 A: but um 

170.60 176.19 A: um maybe if i did have maybe i'd feel different about it i'm not sure you know 

174.09 175.31 B: right 

176.53 178.38 A: (( it's an interesting um )) 

179.06 181.00 A: interesting thought though you know 

180.31 192.29 B: yeah it is it definitely is i mean i i i could say yeah i'll take the million dollars however i doubt it i'd be able to hold up my bargain and not talk to that my best friend you know what i mean 

182.19 183.06 A: (( but if )) 

191.84 196.03 A: yeah well it it didn't say you would have to give it back or 

192.60 193.77 B: i'd i [mn] 

195.74 201.22 B: yeah it didn't want it back or something [laughter] 

196.20 198.22 A: [laughter] 

200.27 207.38 A: [laughter] there's another one another question like that if um would would you take a million dollars to leave the united states and never come back 

207.61 209.98 A: you know but that's a that's a whole other 

209.87 212.36 B: well see that'd be for me it would be easier to answer

212.95 215.34 B: that that'd be i hope i get that topic 

214.64 216.45 A: i'd go to new zealand you know 

216.07 221.41 B: well see i'm i'm not from the united states so for me it's so for me it would be e- easy to d- answer that one 

218.17 219.28 A: oh aren't you
