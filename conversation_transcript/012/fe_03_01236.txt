132.04 137.32 B: i guess we're i'm glad that we are small enough that we do not have to have a certain percentage 

137.33 140.75 B: of any particular ah group 

141.42 143.07 B: because i really 

143.59 146.18 B: feel that a person should be hired on their merit

172.75 174.07 B: how about in your 

174.08 176.12 B: um company or 

176.04 180.91 A: well in um arcnord it's sixty five percent spanish speaking people

183.56 185.10 A: northern mexico 

184.86 186.19 B: mhm 

185.37 186.87 A: and it was partly 

187.25 189.78 A: it w- was mexico at one time 

189.40 190.48 B: right 

191.02 192.11 A: and 

192.22 202.37 A: let's see where my mom is in venice there are cubans el salvadorians um guatemalans filipinos 

204.28 206.98 A: (( um people from iraq and iran )) 

207.13 208.74 A: all kinds of people 

208.54 210.57 B: (( mhm )) 

208.81 213.62 A: all kind people from the islands there's a l- big variety of people 

214.24 215.16 B: hm 

217.65 219.20 B: [noise] so how does that affect 

219.22 223.27 B: um i guess affirmative action are you required to 

223.43 228.17 B: um just have a percentage of minority groups 

228.42 232.57 A: no i just ah i like a variety of people ah 

232.72 234.79 A: i don't work have a company 

235.23 239.24 A: i don't work for i don't own a business at all and ah 

235.45 236.25 B: oh 

240.55 244.97 A: it the way i feel about it is i i'm sure that 

245.24 246.77 A: there's people 

247.12 251.86 A: in the past particularly who were hired to fill a quota 

251.49 252.46 B: mhm 

252.10 253.16 A: but 

253.44 259.70 A: and if you look at the big picture like like the big picture of the united states 

256.29 257.66 B: mhm 

259.87 265.87 A: and the people who are afro american we- were descended from slaves 

265.33 266.51 B: mhm 

266.13 267.01 A: um 

267.71 276.57 A: that unless you continually churn people and have an upwardly mobile that where it's possible to 

276.87 285.55 A: to go up economically if you don't create a way for people to rise you're going to have um 

278.11 279.11 B: mhm 

287.16 299.13 A: people with no stake in the united states at all no they'll be disenfranchised they'll be disgruntled they won't have a investment in this country and they won't be participating 

299.38 301.83 A: they'll be stuck down in the bottom 

301.98 306.26 A: and it's easy especially if you live in a big city if you get broke 

306.57 308.11 A: anybody is 

308.24 318.57 A: a lot of people down here are riding around in big cars big s._u._v.s r- wearing new clothes riding around looking like um 

319.14 323.01 A: they're doing very well and that stuff is not paid for 

320.16 322.52 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

324.95 334.44 B: so you feel so you feel that affirmative action is the means of providing opportunities for people that otherwise wouldn't have them 

324.97 326.05 A: you know 

333.98 338.96 A: y- yeah and it's artificial it was created legislatively it's 

339.35 341.47 A: yeah because um 

342.73 347.64 A: in especially in l._a. or any big city you go up you go down 

347.79 349.03 A: you can go up 

349.26 350.57 A: you can go down 

350.63 352.35 A: and you're um 

352.93 356.93 A: i work i did some volunteer work in a homeless shelter 

356.66 357.71 B: mhm 

357.04 359.51 A: salvation army with women 

359.61 368.19 A: and my deal was i was going to um school in burbank to be a make up artist and i needed to practice 

367.76 368.77 B: mhm 

368.33 372.77 A: i practiced on my own i prac- i didn't do anything but that 

373.08 378.47 A: class and i just practiced practiced practiced until it was second nature 

378.15 379.31 B: mhm 

378.49 382.19 A: i could work on anybody's face who would sit still 

381.94 383.10 B: mhm 

382.37 389.42 A: and i got these um i would call call around these different shelters for ah people don't have any housing 

389.14 390.10 B: mhm 

389.90 401.25 A: and get people to sit for me and there was no difference between those people and anybody else the difference was that they didn't have a first and last because i b- 

401.31 409.50 A: i bet houses i bet houses what are houses priced at at your where you live 

408.66 420.70 B: oh yes the housing market here um is definitely ah less i mean a house that sells here for maybe forty thousand out there is probably two hundred thousand 

419.73 421.90 A: there are no houses um 

422.12 426.15 A: in l._a. for two hundred thousand right now i looked on the internet 

425.87 427.66 B: mhm 

426.16 428.40 A: in a realtor there's nothing 

428.69 433.81 A: that's maybe some foreclosure house in a red line area 

433.18 434.07 B: (( mhm )) 

434.70 435.87 A: but 

436.77 439.90 A: but i there's houses that are 

441.93 444.38 A: there's houses that are um 

445.16 447.31 A: um maybe a million 

447.63 448.55 B: mhm 

447.94 456.52 A: there's houses in venice that are functionally obsolete out of the seventies that are nine hundred thousand dollars and it isn't there it's just a 

456.89 458.00 A: scraper 

458.18 465.65 A: so it's very easy for people to um particularly women to end up um out of a place to live 

467.00 468.31 B: so how does that 

468.43 469.47 B: um 

469.04 477.91 A: it's it's that there was no difference in people that i dealt with who were homeless than anybody else 

478.06 480.46 B: oh no there's not we're all good people 

479.36 487.18 A: they were not separate there was not some big ah issue that propelled them into the gutter i don't know about men maybe they 

487.53 489.09 A: [noise] 

489.96 491.20 A: and um 

491.74 495.37 A: but you know i think everybody deserves a chance 

495.24 496.69 B: [mn] i do too 

495.50 498.61 A: i know i've had i've had chances i've 

498.78 504.05 A: i went to texas one time i went to fort worth and 

504.08 515.45 A: in about i i toured some historic houses and did what i wanted that day and i would have probably been invited to the w- junior league 

516.18 520.08 A: and you know it was because i was white and i looked a certain way 

520.89 526.65 A: if i'd of been um a color or hispanic i would have been treated differently 

521.09 521.79 B: (( mm )) 

526.93 528.45 A: and i knew that 

529.09 532.65 B: but i don't really think that affirmative action helps that 

532.82 534.27 B: because 

534.74 535.68 B: um 

535.96 542.54 B: it's unfortunate that many times in an area of the country where there is not 

542.65 543.97 B: um 

544.10 548.85 B: a percentage of minorities or ethnic groups 

549.18 552.53 B: with qualified personnel to 

552.70 553.72 B: (( ah )) 

553.78 556.83 B: hire for specific jobs 

557.49 570.41 B: people are hired that really don't have the qualifications to fill the job they're only there because they fill the quota for that ethnic group or um for that minority 

570.86 572.66 A: yeah that's not right 

572.44 576.18 B: and i don't feel that that's right i feel that the employer ought to have 

576.62 580.24 B: the freedom to hire a person with qualifications 

581.23 587.65 B: i understand that how or why affirmative action was created and that was to 

587.94 589.07 B: um 

589.11 591.04 B: force people to 

591.36 594.16 B: look at equally qualified 

594.40 596.09 B: ah people 

596.18 599.95 B: and you know not discriminate against them because
