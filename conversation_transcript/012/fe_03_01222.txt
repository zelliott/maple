16.35 17.97 B: [laughter] okay 

16.89 20.47 A: [laughter] i assume we're just supposed to start talking right 

20.48 25.68 B: yeah i think so so i i i think we just ah we just basically talk about ah what we're 

25.36 26.37 A: okay 

26.40 29.07 B: one of the topics so uh huh go ahead 

26.53 27.40 A: well 

28.37 31.08 A: do you have children in school 

31.36 33.30 B: no no i don't have any children at all 

33.35 42.02 A: okay well then we have different perspectives on it mine are grown so they went through the public school system but they're they are out of it now 

39.49 40.38 B: (( uh huh )) 

41.90 42.81 B: (( uh huh )) 

42.80 43.92 A: what's your 

44.40 46.01 A: first initial 

46.03 47.74 A: reaction to the question 

48.15 54.28 B: um i mean basically my feeling about the u._s. public school system is there is not enough money in the school system um 

54.71 65.82 B: and i mean you kn- so i'm i'm twenty nine and i i went to school in the the mid eighties basically um in arizona 

62.80 63.63 A: where 

65.10 65.85 A: okay 

65.87 67.53 B: tucson um 

67.72 76.64 B: and i was in the public school system um and i mean i definitely saw especially i i mean i remember going from high school to university the sort of 

77.14 78.08 B: dramatic 

78.05 79.16 B: shock i mean i went to a public 

79.17 91.71 B: university as well in arizona but the shock was i mean there's a degree of difference in terms of the resources that i mean obviously a university is not going to have it's going to have a lot more resources but the degree of funding that 

91.71 98.29 B: you know there's the the the the lack of funding basically for public schools is just huge 

97.75 99.20 A: and you didn't notice 

98.26 106.77 B: a huge issue with me and i never i mean i guess i had heard about that being problem at but you know when before i had grown up it wasn't so obvious 

106.55 107.37 A: yeah 

106.79 108.67 B: the degree to which it was a problem 

108.07 110.25 A: you didn't have anything to compare it to yeah 

110.01 111.51 B: yeah exactly 

111.57 116.13 A: did you not think that the univers- did you think the universities were w- were well funded 

116.34 117.61 B: (( well they were always )) 

117.68 122.21 B: so i think in state universities there are always funding problems um 

119.72 120.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

123.07 133.38 B: i i don't know so i guess i i'm conceiving of the topic mostly as a secondary education kind of issue primary primary and secondary but um i don't know so what are what are your thoughts on the topic 

130.12 131.36 A: [noise] yeah well 

132.56 137.26 A: well i agree completely that uh there's not enough money 

137.31 140.12 A: in in the devoted to the 

140.51 154.20 A: to the education system and the reason or one of the reasons that there's not enough money is because despite all of our talking we do not really value education in this country we are much too 

154.57 155.54 A: um 

156.92 161.68 A: i guess materialistic in the sense that we're more interested in um 

162.30 167.14 A: production of things than development of minds sort of um 

167.42 168.33 B: (( mm )) 

167.77 172.47 A: and for example we don't respect our teachers 

172.68 173.64 A: enough 

172.99 175.62 B: yeah that's a huge that's a huge problem 

174.88 184.12 A: we don't we don't value them or treat them as the professionals that they they sh- as they should be treated and that you know carries over to the way we 

179.70 180.73 B: mhm 

184.44 185.65 A: we address ah 

185.76 189.67 A: the students and the facilities and everything else we just 

189.93 193.50 A: [cough] don't put our money where our mouth is and 

192.75 194.05 B: mhm 

193.78 199.09 A: so that's my first complaint but my second complaint is that 

200.00 201.04 A: we 

201.54 205.42 A: in this country the politicians have far too much influence 

205.54 215.65 A: over what goes on in the school they need to back off and let the teachers and the educators run the schools instead of trying to dictate things like standardized tests that we know don't work 

211.82 212.94 B: mhm 

215.90 217.08 A: and um 

216.56 217.88 B: yeah 

217.25 218.39 A: you know it's 

218.60 221.35 A: let the people who really do know what they're doing 

221.37 225.73 A: um again give them the respect and the authority and the funds to 

226.00 228.40 A: to do it the way they know it works 

228.56 243.09 B: so i i mean i i totally agree um although i guess what i don't agree with you so much about is that a education isn't valued in this country and i actually think that education is very highly valued um that was my take is is that and 

240.60 245.51 A: i think there's a lot a talk i don't think it translates very well into reality 

245.65 260.65 B: well i mean okay and i i don't think that there's sorry i don't think there's an inevitable conflict between um a country being materialistic as well an- and buying an education i mean no i think i think countries all around the world are materialistic and you know 

258.44 263.28 A: yeah and that's not a good that's not a good word to describe what i'm talking about 

261.18 275.77 B: ah one thing that really yeah well one thing that really strikes me is so i i've actually known school teachers in a couple of different countries ah i had a very good friend who was a a a elementary school teacher in taiwan and then another good friend who was an elementary school teacher in russia 

275.76 282.15 B: and um the the contrast is very remarkable i mean so first of all there's this really weird thing that's going on in 

282.31 294.24 B: in ah u._s. schools where um where the where the public schools are actually less prestigious and less well paid and and less well represented than the private schools and in most countries it's totally the opposite 

294.45 295.39 B: um 

294.77 295.68 A: yeah 

295.88 299.61 B: and i don't really under- i i i mean i i think that that's partly 

299.64 304.12 B: a bigger problem is that salaries for teachers aren't high enough i mean 

303.73 308.18 A: yeah that's partly goes back to my respecting issues and treating 

308.21 310.69 A: the teachers like the professionals that they are 

310.72 315.58 B: yeah i know i totally also another thing that connects with it with what y- with that is that um 

310.95 311.66 A: um 

316.14 327.27 B: is is that so i i know i know i was mentioning also my my girlfriend is actually russian and she ah she lived in russia until about five years ago 

327.37 340.47 B: and ah she when she found out that in the united states parents can complain about what the teachers do in the schools they don't like it and actually have a huge amount of leverage over the children she was outraged because 

335.68 336.63 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

340.70 343.27 B: in in russia um 

343.89 358.23 B: y- you know teachers are trained professionals and it ah they know more i mean it it's common wisdom that the teachers know more about educating children than than parents do who don't have any parents who don't have any specialization and 

354.92 356.80 A: and and again that 

357.51 361.06 A: that comes back to my basic argument that 

358.36 359.25 B: yeah 

361.25 366.98 A: th- the ah ah politicians and the parents need to 

367.32 371.17 A: not so much give the teachers a free hand necessarily but 

370.68 371.85 B: mhm 

371.18 372.80 A: stay out of the way 

373.14 375.14 A: to let them do what 

375.18 379.87 A: they've been trained to do what the research tells them is the best way to go about things 

379.21 382.07 B: yeah i totally agree also yeah 

380.27 382.75 A: and it comes back to a respect issue 

383.19 392.71 B: yeah yeah what do you think about the degree of training ah that that ah secondary and both primary and secondary level teachers get in the united states i 

391.71 393.46 A: [sigh] i think um 

394.50 395.99 A: i don't i 

394.70 403.80 B: wonder if they need more in specialized education i don't know in a lot of countries you know they have these normal you call it normal colleges that everybody everybody who wants to go and teach um 

400.23 401.12 A: yeah 

404.30 411.03 B: teach any kind of say ah primary or secondary school has to get a degree there or i mean under normal under normal circumstances that's the path 

408.90 412.17 A: well i think if you've look at the edu- the 

412.28 415.53 A: education programmes and you know for under graduates 

415.47 417.28 B: mhm 

416.42 418.90 A: um i think they're really pretty good 

418.93 420.71 A: i think um 

419.25 420.07 B: mhm 

421.17 422.14 A: that 

422.37 423.20 A: every 

424.51 427.70 A: i i i'm working on a p._h._d. at 

427.18 428.17 B: (( oh uh-huh )) 

427.86 431.58 A: university of washington and i have several friends who are 

429.48 430.58 B: mhm 

432.13 440.83 A: working on either masters or doctorates in education and or in an education related field and the the things that they study i think are are 

435.28 436.16 B: mhm 

441.69 446.54 A: are i think they're very well prepared by the time they get to the classroom um 

444.38 445.32 B: mhm 

446.88 447.51 A: (( [cough] )) 

448.20 449.46 A: they um 

450.29 452.32 A: they they've got the broad 

452.88 459.18 A: background that you know everybody is required to have the sort of basics in in um 

455.66 456.50 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

459.65 464.40 A: in education and child psychology or you know whatever is appropriate for that level 

462.46 463.30 B: mhm 

464.52 469.31 A: and then they do specialize enough that they are 

464.74 466.02 B: mhm 

469.70 472.28 A: very well qualified to teach in 

472.45 475.47 A: whatever area of course the secondary 

476.36 477.21 A: if 

477.36 488.09 A: if they're allowed to do it that way so many times again because of teacher shortages and pay and all that they don't they don't get they're required to teach things that they have not been 

482.57 484.22 B: yeah that's a big thing 

488.27 492.38 A: specifically trained for and that's a disadvantage to everybody 

489.72 491.00 B: right yeah 

492.04 494.60 B: mhm yeah yeah 

494.52 496.60 A: [cough] but no i think um 

497.03 500.85 A: it well both of my kids went through public schools and 

500.69 501.85 B: mhm 

501.23 501.99 A: (( [cough] )) 

502.09 503.15 A: excuse me 

503.58 506.00 A: um they both are 

506.68 510.68 A: gifted very very intellectual they went through special programmes 

510.77 517.15 A: and um they had tremendous teachers now we i deliberately chose 

514.56 515.44 B: mhm 

517.44 519.72 A: a school district that was not 

519.87 530.57 A: you know the big urban district it was more of a suburban school but it was still a public school the high school had two thousands students you know it was certainly not an elite um setting 

521.71 524.02 B: mm mhm right 

524.82 525.62 B: uh-huh 

530.58 531.41 B: right 

530.66 532.65 A: and yes i stayed 

532.67 539.36 A: aware and involved with what my kids were doing but i did not tell the teachers what to do or how to do it 

535.92 537.17 B: mhm 

538.76 540.08 B: mhm 

539.37 540.52 A: and um 

541.43 542.04 A: (( [cough] )) 

542.13 544.03 A: my daughter is um 

544.49 548.80 A: [noise] just started a p._h._d. this fall and my son is 

548.81 549.54 B: (( mm )) 

549.13 550.11 A: um 

550.70 561.39 A: working on he did not go straight through school he stopped and after high school and [noise] explored a little bit and is now going back to finish his degree but he is the most 

556.54 558.39 B: mhm 

560.29 562.00 B: mhm 

561.59 566.04 A: well read individual i i know including my fellow

567.77 568.86 A: (( [laughter] um )) 

569.40 570.61 A: and they 

570.74 573.15 A: between my encouraging 

573.71 574.88 A: their 

575.13 584.74 A: education and assuming that they were going to do well and it was a priority and the and the quality of the people that were actually instructing them [noise] i think they did very well 

579.02 580.33 B: (( mm mhm )) 

584.72 585.87 B: mhm 

585.22 586.19 A: now 

586.44 597.19 A: having said that and said that parents need to get out of the way and let the teachers teach that doesn't mean that parents are not involved in their children's education or supportive of the educator 

592.14 593.22 B: mhm 

595.19 598.25 B: no no no of course i i totally agree
