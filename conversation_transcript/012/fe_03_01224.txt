12.04 15.60 A: um yes i i do think there's a lot of trouble with the public school system 

15.72 17.88 B: i think so too um i 

18.57 21.94 B: (( did )) uh one year in country and um 

22.64 25.23 B: mainly i think the problem is they 

25.48 28.85 B: teach the tests instead of teaching the things that 

29.04 30.07 B: students should learn 

30.67 32.01 A: exactly the basics 

32.50 33.45 B: correct 

33.13 36.97 A: yes i agree i i as a matter of fact um 

37.16 39.62 A: don't think you get your money's worth in the public schools 

39.81 42.61 A: i think the private schools educate kids for less money 

43.23 44.33 A: per student 

44.46 47.08 A: and i think they do a better job of getting the basics down 

47.73 49.83 B: correct actually my friend uh 

50.42 52.07 B: she has a son and she just 

55.26 55.78 A: mhm 

64.51 66.31 B: tried to put him on medication but 

65.95 66.80 A: mhm 

66.58 70.77 B: this year he transferred to a private school and he is doing so much better 

70.70 73.06 A: yeah i have my children in private schools 

73.47 74.69 A: um where are you located 

75.15 76.04 B: ah in texas 

76.46 76.90 A: are you 

76.52 76.80 B: how 

77.06 77.88 B: how about you 

77.15 77.61 A: i'm in 

77.87 78.96 A: st louis missouri 

79.29 80.10 B: okay 

79.92 83.92 A: and um i'd i i pay money to put my kids in private schools because i 

84.54 89.97 A: i just think that and i think that teachers get tenure in the public schools and i think then they are 

88.19 88.69 B: uh-huh 

90.08 92.69 A: they are there forever and they can't get rid of them 

92.80 94.42 A: i think they have a lot of dead weight 

95.06 101.02 A: private schools they have to be willing to sacrifice you know they don't get as much money here anyway maybe where you are at they do 

101.93 103.84 A: but here they don't so 

104.21 104.76 A: um 

105.12 107.21 A: i just think they are a little more dedicated to 

107.49 114.17 A: usually they are affiliated with churches and things and you get people that are a little more dedicated to their pay checks you know 

114.62 116.22 A: they're there for somebody else 

116.39 119.94 B: uh-huh and another problem i see in public schools is um 

118.38 118.78 A: mhm 

120.41 121.77 B: they will pull out the 

122.03 125.82 B: uh g._t. student or they will uh pull out the special education 

125.94 127.70 B: student like in different times 

127.68 128.24 A: mhm 

127.81 128.33 B: so those 

128.63 130.27 B: students uh 

130.54 132.64 B: miss some of the regular instruction 

132.94 136.84 B: and when they got back uh we don't have time to catch them up with 

136.86 137.57 A: right 

137.35 140.01 B: materials so it was like really confusing 

137.83 138.22 A: right 

140.12 141.15 A: and you know they think 

141.34 145.87 A: that that's the right thing to do to get them the actual help but then they miss the actual teaching 

144.37 144.82 B: yeah 

146.86 147.79 A: i agree with that 

148.40 149.32 A: and now the 

149.62 153.41 A: private schools sometimes you you have to keep up with the pace you know 
153.37 153.90 B: correct 

153.72 159.13 A: there is a downside to private schools too if you can't keep up with the pace sometimes you you know 

160.44 167.27 A: you're in a little bit of trouble but in the public schools i've heard from friends of mine that had kids with problems that that wasn't a problem that they had 

168.13 170.73 A: i guess there's no perfect solution but um 

168.18 168.71 B: and 

170.28 170.81 B: i i 

171.10 171.62 B: yeah it's 

171.73 174.22 B: very difficult to find a solution uh 

172.92 173.43 A: mhm 

174.72 175.23 B: i 

174.72 178.23 A: i think they waste their money too i don't think they spend their money always in a 

178.90 180.28 A: proper ways a 

180.46 182.52 A: friend of mine's father was a um 

182.71 184.22 A: retired man and 

184.70 193.45 A: lost his insurance and lost his job one of those types of guys that got cut at fifty nine years old and worked as a maintenance man just for the insurance 

185.99 186.42 B: uh-huh 

193.59 195.81 A: he said that the waste that the public school that the 

195.96 198.14 A: things they throw away he couldn't believe it 

198.88 202.49 A: so i think that their money isn't always monitored as closely 

203.61 205.02 A: their facilities are nice 

205.69 206.01 A: but 

205.78 206.20 B: yes 

206.63 208.43 B: but if they can reduce like 

208.57 209.08 B: the 

209.35 210.40 B: class size 

212.69 213.53 A: exactly 

215.24 216.35 A: i totally agree 

218.16 221.05 A: yeah i wonder do they buzz in on the line when we've talked enough 

221.83 223.14 A: is this your first one 

223.22 223.84 B: yes 

223.83 227.46 A: me too i just signed up this week so i don't know 

224.43 225.46 B: okay 

225.92 226.82 B: oh 

226.97 229.16 B: that's interesting um but 

228.80 232.46 A: i guess we'll get to meet a lot of neat people across the united states with this 

232.28 235.76 B: yeah that will be interesting uh in texas the (( )) has 

235.94 239.29 B: tests on uh reading writing and math um 

238.33 238.80 A: uh-huh 

239.87 240.16 B: so 

240.40 247.59 B: basically the teacher just focuses on those subjects and they teach the tests and they drill the tests and they spend a lot of time like t- 

245.58 246.19 A: mhm 

247.72 251.31 B: teaching the student how to do well on the tests instead of like 

250.42 251.20 A: right 

251.67 253.53 B: really teaching them how to do math 

253.09 259.31 A: do they rate teachers um the public school system do they rate teachers i mean are their contracts based on the scores of those kids 

259.55 262.95 B: they don't but uh they will look at the whole school and 

263.19 267.67 B: see how the school how many percent of the student pass but if they don't have enough of 

265.37 265.99 A: right 

267.79 271.01 B: percent of student pass uh the school will get in to trouble 

270.40 274.80 A: right that's how it is here too but there's talk of of um 

274.92 282.39 A: making teachers holding teachers more accountable for those tests individually it's never gone through here but i know there's places they do 

282.94 283.42 B: but the h- 

283.01 284.69 A: and i wondered if they did in texas 

284.26 284.56 B: (( so the )) 

285.30 289.31 B: bad part is like uh after the (( total )) pass um the teacher doesn't 

289.48 290.32 B: teach anything 

290.18 290.72 A: mhm 

290.41 293.64 B: they just like videos and they (( don't )) they plan and 

293.67 294.24 A: right 

293.79 295.73 B: so so the whole thing is like 

295.87 303.20 B: all about the tests after the tests you don't need to learn anymore and uh the children get so frustrated they get so 

299.11 299.71 A: mhm 

303.37 306.74 B: scared doing the uh the tests they and they cry and 

306.57 306.99 A: yup 

307.03 308.27 B: yeah it was so 

308.27 310.97 A: yeah i know what that that's i know that 

311.74 313.01 A: the way it is here too 

314.33 315.28 A: and i think that 

315.72 317.94 A: i don't know i don't know what they can do to 

318.85 319.20 B: um 

318.96 324.75 A: improve things and and me not being a part of it i also went to private schools and so did my husband 

325.30 329.97 A: so i've never been a part of the system you know if you're part of it sometimes you can see what to do 

328.51 328.98 B: yes 

330.20 330.91 B: i think the main 

331.14 331.82 B: problem is 

331.97 332.56 B: is um 

333.32 336.80 B: the tests the standardized tests uh they they aiming the the 

337.05 339.15 B: the basic thing and so 

339.65 342.72 B: the students just want to have like maybe the passing 

342.87 345.47 B: seventy and they don't try to get like 

342.92 343.43 A: mhm 

345.58 348.62 B: ninety or a. or like even better than they 

346.47 347.35 A: right 

350.81 352.31 B: they just try to pass it and some 

351.97 352.45 A: right 

352.46 355.79 B: some of the g._t. students they may be able to do very very good but 

355.52 356.11 A: mhm 

355.95 359.17 B: because the seventy is passing and some of them just want to pass 

358.68 359.27 A: mhm 

360.59 360.96 B: so i 

361.06 361.80 B: think less 

361.93 363.90 B: focus on the tests would be better 

363.87 365.21 A: yeah i think there should be less 

365.37 366.51 A: less on that too 

367.41 367.92 A: um 

368.88 371.07 A: working on the classroom work would be a lot better 

371.79 373.03 A: you know i guess they they 

373.47 374.41 A: they do that because 

374.67 378.63 A: obviously they want kids to learn how to take those because look at then you get to the a._c._t. 

378.78 379.28 B: correct 

379.11 383.12 A: when you are ready for college and i know the standards on the a._c._t. has gone up 

383.36 385.04 A: significantly since i 

385.31 385.74 A: took it 

385.87 387.30 A: many moons ago 

386.99 387.51 B: uh-huh 

387.54 392.29 A: going to college um i don't know what the average score is now but i most of the state 

392.40 397.38 A: colleges in missouri i think the minimum standards are twenty two and three to get in 

398.46 403.33 A: so you know in order to get any scholarship money i believe you need at least at twenty five don't you 

401.42 401.86 B: uh-huh 

404.44 404.74 B: uh 

404.92 405.24 B: i 

405.75 410.16 B: don't know like when i'm in graduate school and i don't know if it's just for texas 

410.74 412.29 B: but uh they 

412.43 413.56 B: said that um 

413.83 415.79 B: the law said you can not 

415.96 416.35 B: uh 

417.24 418.01 B: g._r._e. 

418.14 418.50 B: uh 

418.67 420.33 B: standardized tests to hold 

420.58 422.90 B: people from getting people in a program 

423.01 423.53 A: really 

423.88 424.20 B: yes 

424.32 425.16 B: so i was 

425.68 426.59 B: i'm not sure if 

426.74 430.13 B: for undergraduate or like for the high school are they going to less 

429.23 429.78 A: mhm 

430.23 432.22 B: focus on the standardized tests or are they like 

433.38 434.97 B: according to the poli- 

435.04 435.79 B: -cy or like 

435.93 440.45 B: the thing the president talk about they they are going to focus on the standardized tests 

440.11 440.51 A: right 

440.57 441.12 B: more 

440.61 441.84 A: they are you are correct 

443.22 444.70 B: don't think it's a good idea 

444.03 445.15 A: no i don't either 

445.81 447.23 A: i don't either and i and i 

447.75 449.24 A: and i don't know much about the a. 

450.77 457.26 A: beyond the my oldest will just be in high school next year so i'm you know i'm sure i'll learn a lot more 

458.50 458.93 A: um 

459.90 460.20 A: but 

460.33 464.21 A: is the public school district where y- where you live is it a pretty good school district 

464.56 466.02 B: no it's a very small 

466.14 471.15 B: school district and i did one year internship there and it's not very good and 

471.24 472.17 B: um 

472.65 473.76 B: uh if uh my 

474.03 478.84 B: if my friend had children i would recommend them to send them to private school yeah it's like 

476.83 477.38 A: really 

480.19 480.63 B: um 

480.94 481.99 B: i don't know it 

482.20 484.57 B: they have like (( )) class and the teacher just 

485.63 486.22 A: mhm 

486.07 486.58 B: poetry 

486.73 492.73 B: uh they are supposed to be teaching p._e. classes but they they take them and they teach history 

492.16 493.05 A: hm 

492.83 495.67 B: but uh you know they don't know anything about history 

495.10 495.71 A: mhm 

497.39 504.89 A: now see my the district i live in is is a triple a. rated that's how they rate them in the state of missouri triple a. rated is is an excellent 

501.16 501.89 B: uh-huh 

505.55 506.39 A: school district 

506.73 507.01 A: but 

507.63 512.56 A: they'll have a lot of flaws which you know if they are a good district and they still have a lot of problems 

512.99 514.28 A: and i guess i hear because i have 

514.65 516.68 A: i have several friends that teach in the district 

517.13 518.63 A: you know they live near me 

519.05 523.69 A: their kids don't necessarily even go in fact several of them don't even send their kids there 

524.42 527.82 B: yeah i think the public school system would be better so
