319.41 320.03 B: well it's getting 

320.46 321.16 B: more 

321.28 324.15 B: (( )) what's going on over there anyway 

323.67 324.09 A: yeah

326.70 328.08 B: right 

331.45 332.08 B: right i don't 

331.95 333.60 A: because all this would be over with

344.51 345.00 B: right 

344.87 349.19 A: i am you know just making them think he's still alive but mostly 

348.41 349.88 B: well of course because he doesn't want 

350.55 352.50 B: his people to stop fighting got him 

352.57 352.99 A: yeah 

353.17 357.95 A: because most of most of his people some of them are scared and some of them already surrendered 

358.39 367.96 A: um because of most yeah most of them are like you know already surrendered but then you know they've already captured some of the u._s. troops and are holding them 

358.69 359.62 B: of course 

367.70 368.27 B: right 

369.50 371.81 A: oh i just i never 

371.97 374.07 A: i mean in my thirty eight years of living 

374.53 378.78 A: last time when they said they was going to go to war i was like oh they're not going to go to war 

378.56 379.63 B: yeah exactly 

379.74 383.58 A: this time i was like oh you know it's just talk it's just talk 

382.70 384.87 B: well you never know with this president 

384.20 386.82 A: yeah but they went for it this time so 

387.64 388.16 A: but 

387.88 388.57 B: surprising 

388.55 390.79 A: yeah they got enough force so with them 

390.91 393.07 B: well they're hoping it will end soon 

391.06 391.69 A: i believe 

393.36 393.80 B: so 

395.27 397.23 B: well everyone's hoping it's going to end soon but it doesn't 

396.85 398.04 A: i hope it will 

398.20 400.45 A: because a lot of innocent people are getting killed 

398.22 398.73 B: yeah 

400.48 401.57 B: well yeah not just in the 

401.71 403.34 B: definitely civilians 

408.84 417.26 A: they had got uh one of the one iraq had gotten hurt or something they was giving him the u._s. soldiers was giving him water but you know 

417.44 418.95 A: in then they had uh 

419.06 420.03 A: a long 

420.31 428.53 A: uh one of them long long semi automatic rifles but it was it was to his head though while they were giving him water but i was like now 

423.76 424.09 B: mhm 

427.45 429.15 B: they have to though yeah 

429.90 430.75 A: they you know 

430.81 431.47 B: yeah well (( )) 

431.59 433.21 B: that's the price you pay for war 

433.98 434.68 B: well because you 

434.96 436.40 B: can't trust anybody but 

436.56 437.80 A: no not over there 

437.78 438.23 B: well 

439.34 440.90 A: but i just i really wish they would 

441.06 445.83 A: get rid of that man because he's going to if they don't get rid of him he's going to continue 

446.30 452.08 A: i think but you know i think if they get rid of him his sons are just going to pick up where he left off at 

451.53 452.87 B: right exactly because 

452.65 454.89 A: and continue the uh saga of it 

455.09 455.53 B: right 

455.15 456.18 A: and when he goes 

456.57 458.55 B: well they they have a motive and on 

460.21 461.49 B: they have one motive and then 

462.41 463.72 B: to keep america out of 

463.97 464.98 B: their affairs 

465.35 466.82 A: yeah and all they had to do was 

467.38 469.33 A: you know agree with what 

469.53 472.62 A: bush and them was saying and just come to a compromise but see 

472.34 473.60 B: right well (( )) that's that's 

473.34 474.39 A: he don't want to do it 

474.50 477.05 B: well that's just compromising to much for them 

478.29 480.54 A: yes it's it's probably too much compromise 

480.22 482.84 B: yeah and they just they want to come out as the uh 

483.62 484.64 B: the super power 

494.91 495.96 B: yeah right 

495.71 496.48 A: first palace 

496.96 500.09 A: i was like yeah he's probably somewhere just watching that laughing 

499.96 501.15 B: and you know 

500.95 501.58 A: you know 

503.37 508.18 A: because (( )) well he might be wounded he might be wounded he's not you know making no 

508.95 514.79 A: um he's not you know giving his men no orders or nothing and you know something ain't right 

513.65 516.22 B: i think he was just keeping quite to um 

515.59 516.00 A: yeah
