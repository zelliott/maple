264.54 269.00 B: which i don't know why we got that but she likes it um but 

269.58 276.74 B: the c._d. rom games she has are p- much better than her playstation games they actually teach her which i like much better 

275.36 278.66 A: oh that's neat yeah so they're more educational than 

278.77 282.07 B: yeah instead of playing something that's 

282.27 285.48 B: i guess my grandmother would say warping your mind but 

285.28 286.69 A: [laughter] 

285.59 292.92 B: she doesn't play it she doesn't play it too much but i much prefer to have her playing educational games but they don't have a lot of those 

293.01 294.47 A: yeah that's how 

293.18 294.42 B: for playstation 

294.56 307.60 A: that's how no they don't that's how i was when they were younger we started out with uh [sigh] oh with the nintendo and mario brothers but then there was a game that they used to play and it was educational and and so that it was um 

307.95 310.50 A: [lipsmack] can't think of the name of it right now um 

310.86 318.82 A: it was it was a mar- [cough] it was a geography game but using mario and so it taught him you know a- about 

315.23 316.40 B: oh okay 

318.87 332.38 A: just geography in general but made it fun and so my son at the time was like four i think when i got him the the uh nintendo and he he really liked that game in fact he's seventeen now and last year he 

332.33 338.01 A: he was looking for it for the new for the newer version computer systems that we have 

337.93 347.47 A: and was able to find it so he just said that game was just so much fun so i i was like that too when they were little and the older they got the less they were interested in 

347.88 352.98 A: educational games and more about just having fun and [laughter] 

349.26 350.61 B: yeah 

353.08 366.05 A: playing with their friends and i'll never forget the first time my little one was exposed to some kind of kickboxing or kick fighting or something i mean he was only like three and he was playing with a bunch of of uh neighbors and they were 

355.22 356.92 B: [laughter] 

366.27 376.33 A: it was this game that i would never have allowed him to play okay not at that age and i walk in and he was getting into it you know i'm thinking oh my gosh what are you doing letting him play this game 

370.79 371.37 B: (( mhm )) 

376.10 390.46 A: he's too young 'cause he was really getting into it and i said you know we don't need anything to make more violence here [mn] but he thought it so but it's we've always been [mn] um more protective about what we let them play 

376.16 377.18 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

381.90 383.14 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

390.55 398.34 B: yeah i'd like to actually get one that has geography on it that'd be pretty good for them to learn if it was some sort of making it fun that's i've 

390.80 391.76 A: than 

398.17 400.42 A: oh yeah it wa- it was uh 

399.40 401.18 B: never seen anything like that 

402.06 411.09 A: [sigh] i'm trying to think i don't know how if i can ask my son real quick can't remember the name of it 'cause it i think it was definitely mario based and it was but i don't know brian
