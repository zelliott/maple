116.13 117.89 B: (( i wonder if it was really him )) 

117.98 123.41 A: they said that it was but the thing about it is is they're thinking that um it's prerecorded

125.93 128.19 A: before the bombs started yeah

129.81 144.38 A: yeah they think that they think that but they don't know at this point in time he he probably is but from what i was um i heard um another guy that used to be an adviser for him and now i guess he doesn't like him and he's here in the u._s. 

133.71 134.58 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

144.32 152.22 A: he um was the adviser for him in the last war and he said that he moves ar- what he did last time was that he moved around

179.72 183.26 B: no i don't think they think i don't think it was him no 

182.04 187.67 A: i know i don't think it was but i don't think they did a very good job of disguising it either [laughter] 

186.67 191.72 B: [laughter] well they said that also on that program they said that um 

192.23 194.34 B: [lipsmack] before he he has 

194.99 196.54 B: when he's in his palace 

196.60 199.51 B: he has people that cook for him 

199.11 200.00 A: mhm 

199.59 203.88 B: and the head son of the cook has to taste the food before he'll eat it 

203.96 206.23 B: there are so many precautions 

204.00 204.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

205.82 211.88 A: right 'cause everybody hates him i c- i couldn't imagine who wouldn't to be honest with you 

207.90 208.96 B: (( i know )) 

210.34 212.71 B: even his own people [laughter] 

212.10 214.03 A: yeah he kills them 

213.82 214.75 B: yeah 

214.14 222.08 A: uh his son uh um the uday that that's the one that they think is dead they really think that he he's dead

222.57 231.77 A: the oldest he's got two of 'em he's got yeah the he's got the um kind of um chunky looking one and a skinny one and that uday and 

224.50 225.64 B: two of 'em 

231.71 234.56 B: [noise] he's the one that always stands up behind him isn't he 

233.66 238.25 A: the uday's the yeah he's like got that shaved looking head and stuff he's 

237.52 240.04 B: yeah he looks just like his dad [laughter] 

238.76 251.10 A: he he is the worst one of all he's i mean b- all of 'em are bad i mean come on but um he was in charge of their olympic team and um their soccer team 

251.04 256.90 A: if they did not perform well once they were done they had to go he would take 'em and go beat 'em 

256.90 258.21 B: oh good grief 

257.54 262.31 A: i mean i i don't think i would even wanna sign up for soccer [laughter] 

261.76 262.97 B: i don't either 

262.85 264.76 A: i would pass on that one 

263.86 265.81 B: they probably didn't have a choice 

265.42 273.01 A: i i imagine they didn't and then they you know you can't always have a perfect game but i bet you better whenever uday's in charge [laughter] 

272.74 274.24 B: oh my goodness 

273.66 279.78 A: but yeah he's a tyrant i so you're you're for the war things going on over there 

279.67 280.53 B: the what 

280.44 283.60 A: you're basically for the war taking out saddam 

282.63 284.14 B: oh yeah are you 

283.75 288.20 A: yeah definitely i wanna get it done with i've been i've been saying for weeks 

285.95 289.08 B: yeah they they should've done it twenty years ago 

288.70 302.25 A: yeah i've been saying you know for weeks and months since they started this i wish they'd hurry up and go and do it because i think it was more stressful waiting and just waiting for saddam to come over here and and you know have somebody do something to us 

301.70 302.87 B: that's right 

302.19 305.62 A: just sitting there waiting and waiting and giving him more time 

305.85 320.26 A: but the weapons that they're using my husband was telling me that they are so old he said they were back like world war two weapons the weapons and the helicopters and all that their equipment they have is not up to date at all 

319.86 324.42 B: so have you heard any more about the prisoners of war are they torturing 'em or do they really know 

323.44 325.62 A: i so far um 

325.96 338.30 A: i don't know i can't keep count of that right now because they're saying y- you know iraqi television is hollering that they have this many and we're saying that's not true and then we y- i know that they have some of ours 

338.14 342.92 A: but um yeah they're supposedly um coming back on t- on television 

342.70 350.13 A: and saying that we are the ones that are violating the geneva convention somehow i don't know how they're getting it that we are violating it but 

349.91 357.92 A: they said that they're not that we're the ones that's violating it when we take care of their prisoners and feed 'em and everything and they kill ours 

357.34 358.38 B: yeah 

358.53 359.40 A: yeah 

358.55 365.11 B: and there's good old france they say they i think they say they supply them with about forty percent of their weapons 

364.40 369.42 A: russia right now is yeah russia's big into um 

365.22 366.17 B: and then 

369.47 380.56 A: it's gonna be in big trouble too because they are supplying a lot of communication things that are blocking like our satellite um g._p._s. signals and things like that yeah russia 

378.24 379.32 B: really 

379.36 380.69 B: russia is 

380.88 383.95 A: so russia russia france 

381.05 382.87 B: that's not good [laughter] 

384.00 386.41 A: they're all yeah they've all been selling to 

386.58 388.80 B: (( well what's the matter with them people [laughter] )) 

386.77 387.48 A: (( him )) 

387.77 401.41 A: [laughter] who knows they thought they wouldn't couldn't happen to them i guess i don't know but um i think that that's the reason that um france is blocking it so hard saying that they're gonna veto no matter what 

391.79 393.03 B: i guess so 

401.34 409.76 A: there has there has i knew i was saying then when they said that you know somebody that says no matter what the outcome we're we're gonna do this 

409.64 422.48 A: and we're vetoing and that's what they were saying before we were going that no matter what they were gonna veto the decision the vote and the only the only thing that you can come to the conclusion about is that they have something to hide 

422.17 423.96 B: that's right yeah 

422.94 426.40 A: if we go over there then we're gonna find something out about them 

426.02 426.80 B: (( yeah )) 

426.66 440.04 A: and the government supposedly said that they kinda knew what was going on um with russia for the last year and now they're coming and they've been trying to kinda talk to 'em about it but now they're coming out public and letting everybody know about it 

439.88 442.89 B: so what else do you think's going on in current events 

442.61 456.98 A: [sigh] elizabeth smart that was uh you know i don't hear anything else besides the news any more with the war so i to be honest i was trying to think while saying that topic i was like what else besides the war [laughter] 

445.61 446.82 B: oh yeah 

450.31 451.56 B: do you think she was 

455.98 458.27 B: do you think she was brainwashed 

458.87 459.82 A: uh 

460.02 468.85 A: i probably after a point after beating her i i don't know beating but there had to have been some kind of i don't think she went willingly 

468.48 470.14 B: no i don't either but 

468.82 479.25 A: in the beginning and you know i think that probably she resisted in the beginning but yeah maybe i don't know it's uh some kind of stress so much stress or something clouds her 

474.74 475.53 B: like 

477.67 481.71 B: yeah well that's kinda like the hearst woman eventually she was won over 

481.58 490.22 A: exactly yeah they kinda just i don't know get all that duress probably just puts such a strain on 'em that they maybe block out the reality 

490.68 492.86 A: and just go with whatever's there 

492.47 493.86 B: (( yeah yes )) 

493.33 501.61 A: i don't know uh you don't i haven't heard much on really what's really happened with that i imagine they're trying to protect the little girl as much as they can 

500.63 504.56 B: i imagine so i i wonder [noise] was she raped or 

503.77 511.50 A: well i think that well obviously she had to be because did you hear he was calling her saying that she was his wife 

511.24 513.76 B: oh yeah yeah i heard that 

512.05 521.26 A: yes that she was he was saying that he loves elizabeth and she's still his wife now you know if he's calling her wife then he has done something to her 

518.00 518.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

521.01 522.13 B: oh yeah 

521.49 525.92 A: but the parents are obviously wanting to keep it quiet and protect her because 

526.01 534.69 A: the last i heard they were coming out and saying that um they did not want to press charges um for sexual assault against him 

534.87 536.24 B: why not [laughter] 

535.46 542.06 A: so well probably maybe because uh the outcome of them doing that might have been harsher on her 

541.99 552.11 A: 'cause she would have had to recount the events maybe in court who knows maybe they've got so much more on him that they won't even have to press charges for that when if 

551.07 555.30 B: well kidnapping would be enough right there to put him away for life i would think 

552.97 553.72 A: (( [laughter] )) 

554.81 559.41 A: uh you would think so but i'll tell you sometimes i don't know 

559.58 561.96 A: these days um do you have children 

562.09 563.54 B: no i don't uh-uh 

562.89 563.89 A: you don't 

564.18 565.09 B: no 

564.45 566.91 A: i have a four and a five year old so 

566.14 567.50 B: oh my goodness 

566.93 570.92 A: i stay on constant alert it's it's tough 

570.04 573.15 B: are they are they aware of what's going on i mean 

572.43 586.99 A: oh yeah they are um my four year old's not she's she's kinda just blah blah blah whatever she's in her own little world as long as you give her candy and food and a place to sleep and toys [laughter] she could care less about anything else but my five year old 

584.40 585.30 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

586.76 599.11 A: he's starting to um be aware and you don't notice how much that they um see what's going on but 'cause they don't they don't s- say anything to you when they first see it but it'll be lat- 

597.36 599.95 B: you have to be careful not to let 'em worry
