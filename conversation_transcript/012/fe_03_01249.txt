21.76 24.08 B: and we're supposed to talk about affirmative action 

24.39 26.10 B: how did you first hear about this study 

27.13 27.69 A: um 

28.23 30.09 A: this study uh 

32.00 32.93 A: a while ago 

33.55 35.83 A: uh regarding in california 

37.35 37.71 B: oh 

37.83 38.48 B: okay 

38.91 39.63 B: um 

40.02 42.63 B: well do you have an opinion on affirmative action 

43.41 44.03 A: uh 

44.36 45.07 A: actually 

45.18 47.59 A: i have uh two kinds of feeling 

57.92 59.18 A: i think it is okay 

60.63 65.31 B: have you yourself been uh have you yourself profited or 

65.77 66.57 B: um 

67.10 72.16 B: been able to obtain a job or position due to affirmative action 

72.75 73.20 A: no 

73.39 74.73 A: not really because 

75.01 76.27 A: in my area 

76.55 77.85 A: they don't care about this 

77.97 78.34 A: thing 

79.00 82.44 A: the there's uh no such thing in my area 

83.28 83.67 A: (( )) 

83.31 83.58 B: (( )) 

83.77 86.66 A: my area is uh research and development 

86.23 86.58 B: oh 

86.78 87.11 B: right 

87.22 89.74 B: you're right they don't care no it it would be 

90.15 92.97 B: it would be based on your education and your experience 

93.47 95.57 A: yeah and uh basically 

96.70 98.16 A: so they don't care about 

98.27 102.45 A: that so basically i don't have very strong feeling about this 

103.31 104.09 B: either way 

105.35 106.71 B: i i'm not sure 

106.83 107.58 B: myself 

108.12 109.79 B: i don't qualify 

110.53 112.28 B: for affirmative action 

112.68 113.32 B: um 

113.87 118.90 B: i don't anybody well i'm trying to think i don't know anybody who has really 

119.45 120.80 B: benefited from it 

121.38 125.33 B: or i don't think i really know um 

125.87 127.58 B: anybody who has 

128.16 131.15 B: uh not accepted a position or not been offered something 

131.90 137.44 B: due to affirmative action i maybe my father a long time ago but i'm really not sure 

138.03 138.59 B: um 

138.79 141.34 B: so i i i don't really know i think i'd have to 

141.45 147.32 B: think about it we've been offered this topic sort of at the last minute and i really haven't had a chan- 

148.16 150.37 B: to really think about it uh 

150.58 155.89 B: before talking about it so maybe i'm more like i may not have opinions on it 

156.27 156.86 B: um 

157.01 157.88 B: either way 

158.64 160.60 A: because you you don't have chance 

160.78 161.78 A: to uh meet 

161.92 162.20 A: (( )) 

163.03 163.84 A: (( )) 

163.97 169.79 B: no i haven't had experience with it and i don't really know people who have had 

169.91 175.66 B: experience with it uh my former career was in research lab 

175.82 176.46 A: uh huh huh 

176.46 177.29 B: um 

177.85 178.56 B: so 

179.82 181.97 B: i don't like you said i don't have 

182.74 184.07 B: -perience that way 

184.40 189.06 B: because promotions and things were based on your education and experience 

189.55 194.47 B: the only thing i could possibly think of was was because i did 

195.05 195.91 B: teach 

196.06 197.59 B: some medical students 

198.08 200.31 B: was possibly some of them may 

200.55 203.14 B: have had some help getting accepted 

203.66 205.99 B: uh due to affirmative action 

206.32 207.16 B: but i 

207.43 208.68 B: cannot say for sure 

209.12 209.60 A: uh huh 

209.65 210.17 B: uh uh 

209.77 210.22 A: yeah 

210.33 212.09 B: if that was true or not 

212.40 213.34 A: yeah the 

214.14 214.66 A: (( )) 

214.79 215.98 A: experience as me 

218.88 221.65 B: i yeah i really i i cannot tell 

221.87 222.57 B: um 

222.78 225.51 B: i wish i had had that opportunity 

225.82 226.65 B: i think 

226.89 230.54 B: maybe i might have uh it might have helped me 

231.02 233.08 B: i had not applied to medical school 

233.43 235.97 B: but i wondered if it would have helped me 

236.54 237.17 B: um 

237.52 238.53 B: if i had 

239.22 243.46 B: and i also kind of wonder i hear stories about 

243.87 250.83 B: people getting into some of the ivy league schools uh with regards to medical school or business school 

251.24 256.01 B: and that affirm- or college or just a four year college and that affirmative action 

256.26 257.51 B: uh helped them 

257.86 265.96 B: but um i don't have any ex- first hand experience i have just read about this either in the newspapers or magazine 

266.81 267.38 A: mhm 

268.49 269.69 A: yeah uh 

270.43 274.08 A: me too i uh i don't have uh any experience or 

275.03 277.61 A: or know somebody has similar experience 

281.04 281.53 A: uh just 

281.64 282.16 A: uh 

282.28 287.15 A: get the message from the news or something but no personal experience 

287.80 294.12 B: do you know whether or not that affirmative action is just something that companies and universities 

294.85 300.47 B: uh use or is that something that they have to follow is it a law i'm really not sure 

301.14 301.85 A: (( )) 

302.31 304.83 A: uh do they have a formal law 

305.03 306.62 A: uh say about that 

306.83 309.53 A: look like california sometime uh 

310.59 313.47 A: they they have battle this issue 

314.39 318.29 B: i know that there are laws uh banning discrimination based 

321.28 327.58 B: but i'm not sure about laws on affirmative action i don't know if those are just policies that places adopt 

327.89 330.08 B: or if those are actual formal laws 

330.74 331.21 A: hm 

331.95 332.47 A: um 

333.35 336.80 A: no about how uh university of michigan recently 

337.69 338.27 A: the 

338.95 341.36 A: the president george w. bush uh 

342.29 342.98 A: say 

343.20 343.96 A: uh 

344.98 346.52 A: uh have you heard of that 

348.39 352.99 B: uh it sounding familiar but you will have to remind me of what was said 

353.68 354.18 A: uh 

354.82 355.48 A: actually 

356.26 359.98 A: i didn't do uh deep research of that but uh just 

360.10 360.82 A: uh 

361.45 363.36 A: look like similar topic 

364.43 365.30 A: but uh 

365.84 366.36 A: i 

366.91 371.16 A: i didn't do the deep research on on on that part 

373.08 379.58 B: was it with a college or u- was was it with um a department of the university of michigan was it 

379.92 383.16 B: uh the undergraduate or graduate or faculty 

384.00 386.32 A: uh look like 

386.66 387.91 A: is that whole school 

388.05 391.81 A: because they talk about this thing must be in the whole school right 

392.34 392.88 B: mhm 

393.08 394.81 A: um maybe the 

395.32 395.92 A: okay 

396.05 396.81 A: major 

397.62 399.86 A: majorly maybe undergraduate 

401.31 405.50 A: uh undergraduate because uh most students are undergraduate 

411.86 416.44 B: so they they maybe uh having those policies at the university of michigan then 

416.42 417.34 A: yeah ann arbor 

417.73 419.07 A: ann arbor the 

419.95 422.60 A: uh recently i saw some news but uh 

423.44 426.00 A: i uh i didn't pay much attention on that 

426.73 427.07 B: hm 

427.51 431.54 B: i probably don't pay too much attention to affirmative action because 

431.98 433.45 B: it hasn't i guess 

434.12 436.42 B: been uh available to me 

437.29 438.08 B: um 

439.28 441.44 B: and it hasn't 

441.57 441.85 B: i 

442.42 446.18 B: think it ha- i mean i don't think it has directly affected me 

446.63 448.09 B: but if it has 

448.82 450.28 B: i am not aware of it 

450.86 451.40 A: mhm 

450.92 453.76 B: i i'm not aware if it has ever affected me 

454.32 454.78 B: uh 

456.31 456.90 B: i don't know 

457.27 458.50 B: i'm i'm just 

457.35 457.86 A: mhm 

458.72 462.60 B: uh i'm not really sure about that i just 

463.02 464.73 B: i don't have much experien- 

465.24 465.68 B: um 

465.40 465.94 A: hm hm 

465.97 469.19 B: uh i could think the question that we're supposed to answer is whether or not 

469.41 472.50 B: what we think about it and whether it's a good think or a bad thing 

472.82 473.36 B: so i guess 

473.75 475.27 B: maybe neither one of us knows 

475.53 478.93 A: hm yeah i had a similar experience as as you 

479.77 480.30 A: to 

480.50 483.32 A: not because it's not happening in my area 

483.85 486.77 B: do you think th- do you have any friends or 

487.11 488.58 B: family or colleagues 

488.92 490.01 B: that may have had 

490.24 492.47 B: experience with affirmative action 

492.71 495.00 A: uh as i know look like not 

495.57 496.84 A: look like uh not 

497.52 497.83 B: hm 

499.02 500.56 A: so that's the reason 

501.19 502.45 A: why (( )) 

502.69 505.68 A: why i see the news i don't have uh much uh 

506.38 507.43 A: feeling about it 

507.97 512.33 B: or i think maybe it is possible that maybe i might know some people 

512.76 517.30 B: who have had or have b- or have benefited from affirmative action 

518.37 518.95 B: but 

519.51 521.66 B: uh maybe they just 

522.00 523.27 B: they don't talk about it 

523.40 526.97 B: because they don't want people to know maybe that they've benefited from it
