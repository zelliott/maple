39.56 40.56 A: uh-huh 

40.27 41.39 B: yeah 

40.78 45.33 A: yeah i think everybody's kinda tuned in right now but typically we would uh 

45.51 58.82 A: already be watching the news probably at least once in the evening and then we get the paper every day mostly for the comics and the sports but we do read the news sections also 

58.43 60.50 B: yeah yeah yeah 

58.99 62.27 A: yeah and then my husband reads the business section 

62.68 73.60 B: yes yes we we different parts of the family read different sections in this house too but uh but uh always all of us i think read the first section like the the news 

67.48 68.46 A: yeah 

73.18 78.27 A: and then we just have uh one paper in atlanta mainly 

78.36 83.30 A: but we also have an alternative type paper called creative loafing and 

83.31 86.14 A: their writers are not you know always 

86.75 90.37 A: slanted from the same direction as uh the big 

90.75 93.42 B: yes yes [laughter] yeah same here 

91.07 97.16 A: citywide papers so we we look at that when we can get it too it's like a weekly paper we live kinda out so 

96.92 98.05 B: yes 

97.33 99.66 A: we can get it if we go into town or something 

99.62 107.48 B: yes yeah we have uh w- the same thing it's delivered twice a week it's a just a local east ender sort of thing and and it's got your flyers in it and your 

107.32 119.86 B: local news and and uh and and biased opinions [laughter] yeah like there there's nobody not so much uh it's it's actually more interesting to read and and uh than a lot of them 

109.07 110.06 A: yeah 

111.99 114.57 A: well yeah uh the 

119.81 120.74 A: um

122.16 123.84 A: oh wow yeah 

122.99 124.68 B: (( yeah )) 

123.80 138.50 A: yeah the that creative loafing that alternative paper that's actually like a big that's better than probably uh about eighty eighty pages at least and they're kinda part of a chain of alternatives and they tend to be more liberal in their 

138.35 139.28 B: (( yes )) 

138.88 142.96 A: thinking and they appeal to alternative people 

139.76 141.05 B: [laughter] yes 

142.85 144.24 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

143.29 147.91 A: you know they they write towards artists and then they write towards 

147.81 159.38 A: different races and different sexual preferences and stuff so it sort of is it's a little more broad they don't screen for profanity from their writers for example 

151.63 152.50 B: yes 

159.21 163.43 A: and then they run kinda alternative cartoons and stuff so it's like 

162.40 163.17 B: true 

163.60 176.87 B: yeah yeah we have we have um [noise] different different uh like there's another another one called the georgia straight which comes out once a week again and it's it definitely [sigh] i mean it's it's uh interesting to read just for 

176.61 180.27 A: and then that's the one you get to find out where to go hear bands and stuff too 

176.93 177.76 B: for 

179.48 187.54 B: yeah exactly exactly yeah and who and uh who's auditioning and who's whatever but yeah it's good yeah so 

180.47 181.52 A: yeah 

184.89 186.03 A: yeah 

186.78 191.40 A: and then uh you know like you said radio and stuff if you can get n._t._r. 

192.09 196.06 A: and get some news without commercials that's always nice 

195.52 197.32 B: mhm mhm 

196.09 201.10 A: you know from just to to inform you of the facts instead of 

201.44 209.28 A: having a much of a particular slant one way or the other on it that was real apparent about their own opinion they're just presenting the facts more 

208.68 210.15 B: yeah yes 

209.32 212.81 A: and then they leave you to figure out what you think later 

212.80 214.80 B: yeah yeah that's no 

214.67 228.52 B: [noise] we have that and that's that's actually what i listen to it's just it's [noise] it's uh a news radio station that's all it is is news and and weather and traffic and and um and i mean you get [noise] you can only listen to it for about fifteen minutes and then you're 

223.47 224.39 A: yeah 

228.42 230.59 B: [noise] then you're um [noise] 

229.94 233.96 A: yeah that's about as long as we can stay tuned in on anything right now too 

233.76 239.60 B: yeah and you're you're repeating oh i just spilt my coffee here just hang on [laughter] 

240.92 243.53 B: [noise] didn't put the filter in right 

244.39 245.49 A: uh-oh 

244.49 251.34 B: so so how does this how does this [noise] this survey does it like is there somebody listening to us and recording us are you are you in

254.72 255.75 A: you know 

254.76 256.92 B: oh so you're sorta heading this up 

256.86 269.25 A: no no uh actually you know i looked into it online and i went and filled out uh their form and then they wanted your social right at the end and i didn't wanna give it so i just closed the window but then they called me anyway 

257.20 259.35 B: or or we're we're on equal 

268.61 271.34 B: yeah me too me too because it said 

269.86 272.65 A: really 'cause i didn't wanna put my social out there

273.66 274.81 A: yeah 

275.09 277.40 A: so it it must not have been required 

277.21 284.84 B: [noise] no well i stopped because it says what state were you br- raised in right well i wasn't raised in the states and there was no spot for canada so 

280.22 280.92 A: (( oh )) 

284.16 285.97 A: oh well gee 

285.42 290.27 B: so i i didn't i couldn't put anything and i just sorta closed it thought well [noise] 

290.63 302.08 B: you know like like there must be another way and i'll just just um [noise] 'cause i read in on one of these yahoo group things that um that uh a woman from quebec had got in right and [noise] [noise] 

301.42 312.22 A: yeah and then i'm i'm also uh getting some of my news and keeping up with stuff through there too uh i've got a yahoo page set up with all the like my yahoo 

312.11 313.21 B: oh yeah 

312.63 323.35 A: i've got the page set up and ticked the different a._p. and reuters and whatever else was available and the different kinds of news that i wanted to be like alerted for headlines on 

319.26 320.23 B: mhm 

323.11 324.95 B: okay yeah yeah 

323.81 328.08 A: so i've that's another source that i use to keep up with stuff is the internet 

328.05 333.41 B: yes yes me too yeah um i forgot but no i probably um 

328.98 329.83 A: (( you know )) 

333.73 341.76 B: like i'll i'll tune m._s._n. has got uh some great pictures of i shouldn't say great but they are amazing pictures of what's happening 

340.64 342.27 A: (( oh yeah )) 

342.30 349.42 A: i don't uh yeah it's kind of in a way it's sorta awful to have so much access to it it's just too much information 

342.34 343.37 B: (( but uh )) 

349.01 350.42 B: [noise] yeah yeah 

349.54 357.33 A: it really is is why i can do it like ten fifteen minutes and then when they start repeating it's gotta go anyway or i'll get sucked into it 

355.51 356.58 B: yeah 

357.37 360.39 B: yeah especially like today like maybe 

360.53 364.72 B: on friday i was bit more absorbed into it because that's when they started 

364.87 366.95 B: the heavy duty stuff right and 

366.19 367.32 A: uh yeah 

367.03 368.43 B: and i was uh [mn] 

368.64 372.68 B: like it was just sort of a you're in awe [laughter] and i think that's what they call it 

372.04 375.81 A: that's that was part of the name of their little program there 

374.12 379.99 B: i know it and yeah and that's exactly what it like it was so if you just like we'd never seen 

379.25 383.09 A: i can't my awe is i can't believe there's anything still standing 

382.90 390.36 B: i know i know i and like you're waiting this one apartment to fall there you know like all these lights are on it and stuff and when are they gonna hit it because you know but 

389.74 391.91 A: they're not supposed to be hitting it though 

390.92 398.83 B: no and that i heard that after but i i you sort of like like what are they hitting but they're doing they're supposed to be doing what the i guess [noise] 

397.83 408.59 A: they've got to pinpoint all these little they got that darned satellite stuff and they can by golly they can put it in your they could put it in your guest bathroom if they want to 

405.46 406.66 B: yeah 

408.00 409.60 B: yeah that's right 

409.06 412.17 A: you know because of all the satellites and all that magic 

411.83 414.96 B: yeah yeah it's amazing it seems kind of uh 

415.86 418.90 B: somebody's at a disadvantage [laughter] 

418.04 419.89 A: [noise] yeah it's it's 

418.95 422.02 B: but oh well that's uh that's uh that's very um 

421.18 424.56 A: it's really like i think it's so important not to get 

424.61 433.47 A: inured to what you're seeing that's part of what bothers me about it is it seems so distant and small on the screen and it's like actually 

433.84 439.68 A: vast and very loud and dangerous and everything is falling down people are dying 

436.10 436.98 B: yeah 

439.46 440.77 B: (( i know i know )) 

439.94 446.60 A: so i really don't wanna take a risk of becoming inured to any of this i mean i think it's it should hurt when you see it 

446.69 455.89 B: yes [laughter] yeah it's uh and it doesn't hurt near as much as to us as it does those poor people there but uh god anyway it's um 

446.79 447.86 A: you know 

452.23 454.24 A: no uh 

456.05 459.98 B: [lipsmack] it's happening so that's it [laughter] 

459.21 466.74 A: well at least we live in uh places where we get news from a lot of different sources though and people don't try to keep us from finding stuff out 

466.78 467.70 A: (( you know )) 

467.53 468.47 B: yes 

468.59 469.41 B: yes 

468.62 474.24 A: so that's that's awfully important that we can have access and we can say what we think too you know 

471.89 472.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

473.95 474.90 B: yep 

475.24 481.97 B: yes um and and you don't uh you don't realize how lucky you are until something like this happens um 

481.24 482.17 A: you know 

482.25 484.22 A: just to be on this side of the ocean 

482.40 483.17 B: (( yeah )) 

484.14 487.63 B: yeah like you just think that everybody can like my kids they they 

487.66 490.53 B: it's a real eye opener for them because um 

490.17 492.27 A: do they worry that it's gonna come here 

492.35 500.53 B: well i'm not sure [noise] i don't think so a- any more like i think they thought maybe something was gonna happen [noise] maybe last week 

500.78 514.03 B: like i've got my youngest is fourteen right so she's she's uh she reads the paper quite thoroughly like both my kids do and and uh and i think they've probably [sigh] settled they've settled a bit about it but they just um 

506.29 507.29 A: mhm 

514.10 515.90 B: [lipsmack] they just um 

515.91 518.04 A: but then you don't want 'em to get used to it 

517.83 531.12 B: no no but they i mean it just it they don't they don't realize how i mean i was born and raised here in canada too but [sigh] but uh you don't even think how lucky you are until something like this happens and and it's been a real eye opener for my kids 

518.34 519.32 A: you know 

530.74 531.64 A: really 

531.31 535.91 B: because we've sorta been through some of these before but [noise] a little bit like 

536.06 540.51 B: [lipsmack] little bit [laughter] yes but uh 

537.03 540.92 A: yeah just a little bit you know nothing like this 

541.06 542.56 B: no no 

541.70 544.46 A: and you know though it could get worse is all 

544.10 547.24 B: well i think it will i think it will i think it will 

545.17 548.71 A: you know and then how bad it is right now already 

549.01 553.58 B: yeah yeah they said they're having they haven't hit b- the um 

549.71 550.71 A: yeah 

553.65 554.54 B: that 

554.73 557.80 B: [lipsmack] [laughter] the big city yet um 

557.85 561.91 A: oh they're they're trying to get their ground forces to baghdad 

561.33 563.97 B: baghdad that's yeah like they're they're 

563.49 570.66 A: and i don't know if that's gonna be the end of it when they get control of that if they're gonna be able to say well okay it's over you know 

570.57 576.98 B: [noise] i don't think it's gonna be that easy to get control of it as they might think either 'cause they've they've had a few problems today 

577.49 578.76 B: already 

578.73 579.47 A: (( mm )) 

579.20 582.04 B: in another city but anyway i guess 

582.33 583.98 B: what happens happens [noise] 

584.66 588.61 A: yeah [sigh] yeah there's not a lot we can do except for worry and try to 

589.13 590.49 A: understand 

590.21 591.05 B: yes 

591.54 597.61 B: [lipsmack] is there is there other [mn] how do we get the next question or is that all we're doing is this one question 

597.24 599.89 A: um i would think that it was just
