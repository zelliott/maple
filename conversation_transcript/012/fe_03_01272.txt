110.56 111.18 A: right now 

111.41 116.65 B: i'm i'm assuming so or maybe even generally speaking i think my answer would be the same irrelevantly 

116.77 117.25 B: um 

117.59 121.49 B: primarily the t._v. the news we start off with the today show 

122.44 127.92 B: excuse me we actually start off with local news at about six o'clock in the morning and then turn on the today's show at seven 

128.13 128.61 A: uh-huh 

128.96 133.47 B: and that's about the only thing that i truly like on t._v. other than that i don't have it on 

133.70 138.12 B: and that's my pri- i would say that's my primary source of keeping up to date on current events 

133.75 134.23 A: oh okay 

138.33 139.93 B: and then occasionally the newspaper

142.01 142.83 B: current events 

142.99 145.80 B: i don't know it seems like by the time the newspaper shows up it's 

146.00 146.93 B: kind of old news 

146.76 150.80 A: old news that's how i feel especially lately i did look at 

151.32 157.45 A: today's newspaper kind of thoroughly because i had company all weekend and i didn't want to sit around and watch 

157.81 162.97 A: t._v. and all the events so um and there were um i had some unanswered questions and those were answered 

163.12 165.39 A: by the newspaper but for the most part i would say 

166.29 167.79 A: um i get my news from 

168.38 170.74 A: television especially when there's something 

171.11 172.49 A: serious going on i would

181.58 186.23 B: sniper was going to go anywhere outside of the d._c. metropolitan suburban area that's

455.44 456.28 A: so have you been there 

456.38 462.74 B: no but i k- keep hearing great things about it we um my husband's family is a big automotive family so i always 

463.09 466.14 B: hear about these great things in the greater detroit area only we just never 

466.73 470.18 A: but i have to tell you the ford museum is not 

470.72 471.28 B: oh it's not 

471.32 476.44 A: an automotive museum henry ford collected everything it's the best i've 

477.44 477.83 A: i don't 

478.61 482.20 A: want to boast or anything but i've been all over the world and i've been to 

482.87 486.02 A: all sorts of museums and i think henry ford is 

486.19 487.64 A: the best and your children would love it 

487.78 488.29 B: really 

488.41 490.68 A: so and and i probably am 

491.13 491.68 A: um 

491.89 499.33 A: biased because my mom and my brother both worked there when i was growing up and we lived there and i went there all the time but just neat collections 

500.02 501.66 A: just everything in the world you could think of 

502.05 503.01 B: and would you say 

502.11 503.01 A: is probably there 

503.21 504.22 B: would you feel like you could a- 

504.34 508.60 B: -ccomplish all of it in one day or would you go for a couple of days and break it up or 

508.68 511.32 A: well there's the henry ford museum and 

511.91 513.13 A: greenfield village 

512.98 513.36 B: okay

517.33 522.31 A: the houses like the wright brothers and gosh i haven't been there in so long but 

522.73 525.06 A: uh no so you would definitely need two days 

525.69 526.42 A: at least 

527.50 528.62 B: got a summer aside trip 

528.81 532.49 B: we're always looking for especially since i've been not working i'm always thinking of things to 

533.60 538.07 B: to very active children happy and busy and that might be a neat 

535.58 536.29 A: uh-huh so i have 

538.22 540.19 B: side trip and we have relatives that live in rochester 

540.50 540.98 A: uh-huh

543.70 546.68 A: i i think so yeah that sounds real familiar 

546.77 552.10 A: to oh rochester oh that's where i think that's really where madonna grew up somewhere out there 

550.96 551.33 B: i think

552.53 553.56 A: okay 

554.14 554.69 B: so unfair
