11.87 15.31 B: um i guess we're just supposed to talk about it what do you think 

16.19 18.46 A: uh yes i do think it's a good policy 

19.56 20.78 B: where are you calling from 

21.84 22.95 A: rex georgia 

22.96 24.48 B: oh okay we're both in georgia 

25.11 26.58 B: i work for a company uh 

26.77 28.50 B: as a matter of fact i do a lot of the hiring 

28.73 30.70 B: i work for a company with a hundred employees 

30.86 31.54 A: uh huh 

31.30 37.20 B: and uh we we actually do have an affirmative action policy we do a lot of our hiring from within and i 

35.26 36.06 A: (( )) 

37.61 40.13 B: i agree with you there i think it is a good policy 

41.09 41.83 A: hm 

42.09 53.50 A: well i think it gives um african americans women and other minorities opportunities that they wouldn't otherwise have um 

53.74 54.37 A: you know 

54.80 56.51 B: i do i agree with you on that 

55.64 56.31 A: yes 

57.02 58.42 A: you know giving them opportunities is 

58.86 67.27 A: to um be exposed to try things to be around other people and other people to be around them so 

66.49 66.93 B: mhm 

67.99 70.77 A: um it encourages diversity i think 

70.79 73.84 B: i actually when i when i first came to work there we ac- 

74.40 75.20 B: only had 

75.62 78.11 B: i was the only girl there and it was mostly men 

78.42 81.08 B: and over the years we started hiring women in 

81.43 82.19 B: and uh 

82.64 85.97 B: it actually it it it's a better workplace now i think 

86.35 86.70 B: i uh 

86.42 88.01 A: i think i think so 

88.05 90.33 B: you get a lot of different ideas you get 

89.94 90.58 A: mhm 

90.61 91.70 B: uh a lot of different 

92.34 92.82 B: um 

93.13 94.55 B: i don't know a different points of view 

94.70 95.57 B: more or less 

95.98 98.50 B: and um we're we're all like a big family now 

99.40 100.95 A: right um 

101.64 104.95 A: yeah that's true you is this good to be exposed to 

105.09 113.01 A: other people and other cultures so you won't just have one limited viewpoint you know i really enjoy um 

113.33 124.17 A: being around other people because if you just find one race then you know you don't get to learn from other people learn what their culture is you know we're a multi-cultural society we enjoy different kinds 

124.56 128.68 A: kinds of food um music and 

128.85 129.44 A: you know 

129.99 134.77 A: our society our workplace and everything college should reflect that 

135.10 137.88 B: well that's that's a i agree with that's very true 

138.28 138.85 B: i um 

139.28 140.21 B: i actually 

140.92 145.12 B: had um always worked you know in doctors offices things like that and for the most part 

145.63 147.11 B: medical was always 

147.26 147.74 B: always 

147.92 148.40 B: you know 

149.40 150.25 B: very equal 

150.68 151.10 A: mhm 

150.78 151.20 B: uh 

151.79 152.59 B: you know because 

152.99 157.62 B: sickness and and caring and all that i guess there's no race or gender or anything 

158.09 158.76 B: and uh 

159.01 160.07 B: but then when i came out 

160.18 171.47 B: uh quit doing medical and went to the private sector mostly i just worked with a bunch of women in offices and stuff and uh it so it it is it's very different and you get uh 

172.10 174.06 B: get uh a good mix of people i say i have 

173.85 174.80 A: (( )) yeah 

178.58 183.82 A: (( )) and it it's upsetting to think that um politicians are trying to um 

183.98 193.81 A: eliminate that get rid of affirmative action and we want to go back instead of forward you know before fir- affirmative action you know 

194.15 195.22 A: people did not 

195.67 199.93 A: you know minority groups women did not get the opportunity to 

199.18 200.06 B: exactly 

200.15 209.23 A: right and now they want to go back to that and thinking that maybe everything will be all right and everybody will get that opportunity i don't think so 

209.19 213.69 B: i don't either i know i know the e._o._c. and the equal opportunity 

214.08 216.14 B: um you know employment i guess 

217.74 218.18 B: does 

219.28 222.49 B: okay but they actually i think just take complaints 

222.65 224.89 B: you know when you have a complaint or when somebody steps 

225.01 225.86 B: forward and speaks 

226.41 227.92 B: and i don't i don't think that 

228.32 230.51 B: that you know without affirmative action 

230.77 232.55 B: a lot of people wouldn't step forward and 

232.69 233.52 B: (( )) or wouldn't 

233.65 235.60 B: wouldn't say anything and it would go on and 

235.92 236.56 B: i actually 

236.66 238.04 B: especially since that's probably here 

238.46 240.71 B: true here in georgia 

242.55 245.89 B: that's a horrible thing to say but uh 

245.50 246.84 A: yes 

246.48 247.13 B: but uh 

247.65 249.30 B: but i i think you know there's a lot of 

249.51 250.20 B: i don't know 

250.54 253.74 B: i don't know about where you live but where i live we've raised the governor 

253.45 254.00 A: right 

254.05 256.27 B: i'm not quite sure about him myself 

256.40 261.24 B: because i live in (( )) county and uh 

259.85 262.24 A: yeah 

261.84 262.40 B: but uh 

263.01 267.61 B: i i'm not sure you know what else we're supposed to say (( )) because we both agree and i 

267.85 268.72 A: yes 

269.17 269.59 A: yeah 

269.20 269.63 B: um 

270.40 271.40 A: we do agree 

271.11 272.07 B: have you have you been doing this 

272.26 272.55 B: um 

273.57 274.88 A: have i been doing this before 

274.88 281.10 B: uh huh have you ever done it before this is my first time too i actually i signed up through money and shopping and uh i was looking at the 

275.23 275.86 A: no 

281.52 284.13 B: a list of topics and i was curious how they were going to do it 

284.32 284.85 A: mhm 

285.65 287.68 B: but it but it is kind of interesting all of them 

287.79 290.04 B: i i have something to say now that i think 

291.80 292.33 B: uh 

292.74 293.26 B: but um 

293.54 295.75 B: i'm trying to think of something else that we could say but we 

295.88 296.30 B: (( )) 

296.47 298.39 B: both of us think that completely agree about it 

298.66 299.24 A: mhm 

299.43 301.63 B: and i do think it would be a shame if they do away with it 

301.99 304.83 B: but i i wonder how many of us actually will have a say 

305.04 307.37 B: and whether they do away with it or whether they don't 

309.04 312.03 B: i think a lot of people don't ever have a say in anything 

312.53 316.13 A: yes that's true like like the the 

313.61 314.29 B: so much 

316.40 323.96 A: the events that are happening now uh i nobody's asked me whether i support the president nobody's called me 

320.16 321.32 B: i know yeah 

323.79 325.80 B: just see if you did or not 

324.06 324.49 A: (( )) 

326.03 327.14 A: oh yeah 

326.15 326.46 B: and 

326.96 329.98 B: and even to you know contacting your congressman or whatever 

330.30 330.76 B: you know 

330.86 333.17 B: if two or three of us do it i don't know that 

333.27 334.16 B: that it actually 

334.60 335.05 B: um 

335.43 338.36 B: measures up to the big companies and all that do that 

338.98 339.57 A: mhm 

339.31 340.70 B: but i i really do think that if 

341.18 343.13 B: they did do away with affirmative action 

343.63 347.76 B: i especially when you know when you look around like enron and all the things that happen 

348.20 348.69 B: companies 

348.93 350.88 B: big corporations who have a lot of money 

351.22 354.47 B: they pretty much do their own thing anyway like their own laws and stuff 

354.80 355.30 A: uh huh 

355.70 358.44 B: and uh i i think that it would be a bad thing 

359.17 360.72 A: it would it would it just 

361.90 366.67 A: it just encourages diversity and i think diversity is good you know 

366.32 368.74 B: well (( )) that's what we're all about isn't it 

368.37 369.44 A: yeah the 

369.58 373.75 A: the world is diverse why should why shouldn't you know 

373.84 374.72 B: a few people 

374.31 376.23 A: anything else just like that you know 

375.00 375.99 B: (( )) 

376.37 380.20 B: mhm a few people speak for everybody or tell everyone what to do 

381.20 382.58 A: well 

383.29 386.53 A: you know some people don't want to let go of power so 

385.90 390.48 B: i i can imagine that and there are a bunch of them that don't want to let go of power 

387.68 394.87 A: yeah it's a man's world sometimes you know 

394.19 394.62 B: well that's 

394.73 397.76 B: that's really true i i find that a lot and i actually 

398.06 400.18 B: like i've i've been in my job for 

400.34 402.42 B: sixteen years i've been with the same company 

402.75 404.80 B: and i do i do a lot of things there and i 

405.14 407.05 B: i made a lot of good changes and stuff 

409.19 410.73 B: that if i left my company 

411.39 412.73 B: start all the way over (( )) 

412.84 413.65 B: bottom of the pay 

413.75 414.68 B: scale back at the 

415.23 416.51 B: at the you know what i mean 

416.52 417.38 A: mhm yeah 

417.02 418.21 B: it's like i'm i'm 

418.85 423.25 B: i i like what i do and i don't really want to leave but if i ever wanted to move or do something else 

423.81 425.61 B: i i know when i moved from atlanta 

426.04 427.29 B: you know i i was doing 

427.54 428.95 B: really well as far as like 

429.35 431.82 B: pay-wise and experience and things 

430.35 431.08 A: yes 

432.12 439.12 B: but when i came back down here i had to go work for four dollars and fifty cents an hour you know and i had to work my way back up from the bottom 

439.17 439.85 A: right 

440.48 444.22 A: hard difficult that's a difficult thing to do 

441.88 443.11 B: yes it really is 

444.02 445.94 B: and i think you know affirmative action at least 

446.41 447.60 B: and on that level 

448.01 448.53 A: mhm 

448.15 449.46 B: would would make a big difference 

449.76 452.39 B: you know makes a big difference for all of us because at least in 

453.04 455.93 B: corporations and things like that people do have to 

456.80 457.83 B: follow a set of rules 

458.90 460.04 A: that's true 

460.47 462.21 A: give us a say you know 

462.35 463.12 B: exactly 

463.03 465.09 A: we'll fight it we won't have any
