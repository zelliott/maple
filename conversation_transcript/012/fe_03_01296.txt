236.63 241.38 A: well i go i listen to national public radio 

241.51 242.71 B: (( right oh okay )) 

242.16 244.12 A: are you familiar with that at all 

243.84 245.68 B: i'm not actually 

245.07 245.91 A: okay 

246.03 258.02 A: um it's not a government site but it's uh a private thing but has to do with the government are are you familiar with um [laughter] can't even think of it uh public television 

258.51 261.07 A: the educational television station 

261.35 264.06 B: mm not really not very 

262.95 263.86 A: okay 

264.10 268.86 A: well we have that and national public radio is has 

268.87 271.46 A: radio stations throughout the country 

271.19 272.36 B: okay 

271.91 281.02 A: and it's news and and other things but it's all talk but it it it doesn't tend to be as crazy as some of these talk sites it it's not 

280.79 281.69 B: i see 

281.10 285.65 A: right wing or left wing or anything like that and people don't yell at each other usually 

283.39 284.34 B: okay 

284.73 287.48 B: [laughter] okay 

286.46 295.15 A: but um i like it because you can get it anywhere in the country so when we're traveling i can still listen to the same news with the same people 

292.15 293.17 B: (( yeah )) 

294.74 298.33 B: oh of cour- but may i know what what channel 

298.38 306.59 A: well it will be down at the end one end of your station on f. m. and ours here is eighty eight 

304.21 305.12 B: okay 

306.90 314.44 A: point nine or or what nearly no it's ours is ninety four point nine but there's an eighty eight point five 

306.92 308.02 B: (( oh )) 

314.24 315.24 B: okay 

314.81 320.15 A: but um it's very nice because it's it's without commercials 

319.63 321.68 B: okay yeah that's a good thing 

320.37 321.75 A: and i 

323.06 324.03 A: go ahead 

323.99 330.10 B: oh no no no i think the site without commercial is good or is or you 

328.20 339.65 A: yes it is i mean they give things they say this is sponsored by or you know they provided the funding but we don't have commercials otherwise except two times a year they ask for money 

332.82 334.25 B: oh right 

336.26 337.14 B: okay 

339.44 340.44 B: (( [laughter] oh mhm )) 

339.69 347.69 A: and they want you to s- send in money well in great britain for example if you wanna listen to the radio stations you have to pay 

348.06 351.03 A: uh a fee and they go around 

351.71 356.16 A: trying to find out who hasn't paid their fee but then they don't have advertising 

357.27 364.65 A: but this one they just want people to give money but i like it because it provides in depth coverage 

364.54 365.52 B: okay 

364.90 367.50 A: and uh it's just 

367.77 373.44 A: and it they try to make it as non biased as possible obviously you can't do that 

373.08 374.30 B: i see 

373.70 377.70 A: but uh that's how i get my most of my news 

377.44 378.82 B: (( okay i see )) 

378.19 380.76 A: and then the rest is from reading the newspaper 

380.68 381.70 B: okay 

381.36 383.91 A: and from go- oh yeah i go online too
