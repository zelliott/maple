295.94 297.16 A: oh my goodness 

296.82 303.55 B: and no one noticed so- someone noticed it but you don't notice it through just watching and not looking for it 

302.95 304.34 A: oh okay 

303.77 309.01 B: but if you're watching and looking for it you notice it it's like an s. and then a e. and then a x. [laughter] 

308.44 311.95 A: oh my gosh i'm going to have to go and watch that again now [laughter] 

310.81 317.51 B: yeah at some part in it so you know you have to go back and watch it and then you start picking up on more things you know [laughter] 

316.73 317.89 A: uh-huh 

317.81 320.16 B: but that's kind of disney's trick you know

468.98 471.20 A: [laughter] yeah

481.57 482.63 A: uh-huh 

482.29 485.12 B: i didn't see that movie until i was working in day care 

484.68 486.09 A: [laughter] 

485.32 488.38 B: and i saw part of it showing it to the kids and then i took it home 

488.11 489.66 A: [laughter] 

488.85 493.08 B: [laughter] but the movies like you know they have so much action now like um 

493.57 497.74 B: the one movie that i watched when i was a kid escape to witch mountain 

497.41 498.39 A: uh-huh 

498.00 501.91 B: that i was kind of explaining to my kids this was like my harry potter back then 

501.50 503.52 A: right yeah 

502.62 505.63 B: and so i got it for the kids and we watched it 

505.03 506.23 A: did they like it 

505.79 507.57 B: it was so boring [laughter] 

506.85 508.65 A: [laughter] 

508.58 512.07 B: i mean i kept saying oh it's going to get better it's going to get better and it's like 

511.87 513.21 A: it never did 

512.50 515.73 B: there's no action in it like what they watch now you know 

513.42 515.10 A: [laughter] 

515.29 522.24 A: yeah there's so many special effects and and different thing- film angles and all that in the movies now 

519.90 521.05 B: yeah 

522.05 527.62 B: yeah i was like oh my goodness my kids will never watch another movie i bring home like this [laughter] 

526.22 527.67 A: [laughter] 

527.75 529.14 B: you know because 

529.15 532.07 B: it was neat to me back then you know 

531.59 533.22 A: yeah 

532.46 538.38 B: but um [sigh] now it's the movies like harry potter and all its special effects 

537.77 539.04 A: mhm 

538.81 539.80 B: (( you know )) 

539.90 542.02 B: we haven't seen harry potter two 

542.24 548.00 A: i i saw it but i didn't really get to pay too much attention because my youngest one was kind of 

548.08 550.04 A: fussing around at the time so 

548.93 550.41 B: mhm 

550.59 555.76 A: but i read i read all the books i books are better than the movies in my opinion [laughter] 

555.05 556.69 B: yeah yeah 

555.93 560.04 A: if there if there's a book to a movie i mean not all of them do have books but 

557.82 558.77 B: uh-huh 

560.11 564.39 A: like ah like all the stephen king movies the books are always better 

562.27 563.53 B: mhm 

564.31 567.94 B: yeah because you can imagine like more stuff in it 

567.31 568.57 A: right 

568.07 575.12 B: like we saw we've been reading the book left behind and the that we didn't like the tape as much 

575.63 581.17 B: or the movie as much as the books because you can imagine what these people look like 

577.34 578.40 A: uh-huh 

580.60 581.97 A: right 

581.39 584.99 B: and then when you actually see the movie and they're not looking like you know 

584.49 585.52 A: yeah 

585.26 589.35 B: like what you imagine it's like oh how disappointing [laughter] 

588.81 596.52 A: yeah and i mean sometimes they'll change things too because they can't you know they're not able to be filmed that way or it would take up too much time of the movie or 

592.08 593.34 B: yeah 

596.71 599.89 A: things like that and they change it and then it makes you f- kind of feel cheated
