4.09 5.62 B: hi i'm susan 

8.39 11.06 B: [noise] yes 

9.27 10.00 A: (( susan )) 

11.11 12.79 A: hi this is gloria how are you 

12.70 19.83 B: i'm okay how are you doing this is my first time so you [laughter] so you have to excuse me i was waiting for something else to happen there 

14.75 15.72 A: good 

19.28 23.12 A: (( oh that's i was kind of like hm )) 

22.15 26.23 B: (( [laughter] yeah i i never heard a tone [laughter] )) 

25.29 29.56 A: yeah i was expecting a call on my home phone and it came on my cell phone so 

29.24 34.00 B: uh-oh okay [laughter] well what do you think about affirmative action 

34.72 41.96 A: well i don't have i'm not real opinionated on it to be quite honest with you um 

42.84 44.17 A: ah what's your opinion 

44.16 53.20 B: well i i i'm not really um opinionated on it i guess i worked for the government for eight years so i saw a lot of affirmative action 

53.40 61.48 B: in the workplace and what i did see of it in the government realm was not good um 

60.37 61.12 A: right 

61.69 63.28 B: [noise] just because 

63.44 70.02 B: there were people being promoted who did not um deserve to be but because 

68.28 70.72 A: (( technically yeah )) 

70.05 73.57 B: right but because they were in the affirmative action programme 

73.42 85.74 B: you know they were promoted i mean i i was a very low grade and i was writing the letters for a guy who was three grades above me who was my supervisor that could not spell [laughter] so 

84.46 85.81 A: oh really 

85.53 91.57 B: yeah so you know um that's i've not had a good experience with it i think in 

91.61 101.05 B: the beginning the programme was probably a good idea but i think the powers that be that got involved with it um and used it to 

95.65 96.79 A: right 

100.97 107.45 B: ah their advantage and the people they knew i think they've they've corrupted it to the point that it's no good anymore 

107.33 115.44 A: oh i'd have to agree with you on that i i don't i don't agree with the fact that um people are getting hired based on 

113.82 115.11 B: [noise] 

115.77 119.39 A: not experience or how well they can do the job 

119.17 120.16 B: right 

120.31 121.15 B: right 

120.48 129.00 A: see i i don't agree with that i can't say that i've i'm not in a work position where that's really comes in affects me directly 

128.14 129.83 B: mhm mhm 

129.09 136.92 A: but i i don't i think people should be hired based on their knowledge and how well they can do the job 

136.91 138.92 B: right i agree 

138.02 144.11 A: not not any type of what's your sex or your ethnic background is or anything like that 

144.04 157.30 B: right and it and it shouldn't you know and there again my father also worked with a brazilian um for the government and it was one of those things that ah he got passed over many times for a promotion because he was a white male 

157.23 171.91 B: and h- he was more qualified for things but they had to have a quota and so therefore i i've not seen it since i've gotten into private industry i've not seen it be as manipulated as it is in the government industry so 

157.27 158.50 A: right 

171.75 173.37 B: um i maybe 

173.62 178.98 B: maybe it's doing better um private industry wise than it is you know in the government 

179.01 180.15 A: correct 

180.40 182.01 B: so i i don't know 

180.72 186.73 A: yeah i as i say i as i say i think it's more directly effected in the government jobs or it seems to be anyway 

186.67 190.51 B: right oh well i was just thinking today where i worked um today 

190.40 205.11 B: we have fifty five people in the office that i'm in right now and of course the majority are a are women because ah of the type of positions that are available there but we have um out of those fifty five people we have one black 

205.27 206.64 A: right 

205.31 214.65 B: female and that's it as far as a minority now we did have i think some indians ah a couple of indians ah you know in ethnicity but 

214.48 225.61 B: um we probably are are very below in the ethnicity portion where we are not with the gender so you know i guess we can get by with it that way um 

221.17 222.06 A: correct 

225.71 235.40 B: although i don't think the people that are in management there are biased in any way one way or the other it's just one of those things where if you do the job good you're going to have it so um do you work 

233.07 233.99 A: right 

236.35 238.77 A: yes i do i work for a coll- 

237.49 239.45 B: uh-huh what 

239.08 243.18 A: i work basically actually um there's only other one other woman 

243.48 250.85 A: in the department that i work in so i'm primarily working with males i don't know that it's necessarily um 

243.51 244.65 B: (( oh okay )) 

245.30 246.45 B: right 

251.27 257.01 A: by choice it's just it's i work for a sales for a bunch of salesmen and of course that 

253.06 254.29 B: (( [noise] )) 

257.15 263.66 A: that um group seems to be more men are more actually wanting to take that type of job 

263.50 268.76 B: right i agree with that [laughter] had one of those don't want another one [laughter] 

267.60 278.14 A: yeah and the two women that did have the position that all the men have actually didn't work out just because it does seem more of a a male um type of job 

278.05 279.13 B: right 

278.94 289.15 B: yeah well and i you know i i would really like to see affirmative action go in a direction that it needs to go which is wh- what it was instituted to do which was to help minorities um 

279.16 280.00 A: so 

288.37 289.34 A: yeah 

288.94 301.66 B: to you know to be able to but but the one thing is they're not it's not helping minorities in the way that it was formulated to which was to be able to get them into the workplace and have them paid equally um you know we're 

300.49 301.89 A: as i say now it's 

302.11 305.24 A: yeah now it seems like that um 

305.25 314.75 A: that people are getting the opinion that sometimes minorities are getting the jobs primarily because they had to be that position had to be filled by someone 

313.61 314.80 B: that's right 

315.00 316.43 A: by a minority 

316.15 330.74 B: yeah yeah i i definitely agree with that because i've you know i've seen it happen like i said i think that's more in the government and i i don't know as far as like the military um i'm not sure about that um i've only seen it on the civilian side so i don't know 

320.55 321.38 A: right 

330.96 332.35 B: you know what the 

332.48 336.23 B: what the the military portion of that would be um 

335.47 336.46 A: right 

337.19 338.97 B: and i i 

339.33 346.77 B: i don't know i don't know a way to um correct how it is now i mean do you have any ideas on that 

346.25 348.63 A: oh gosh no because like 

347.98 349.28 B: [noise] 

348.86 360.52 A: probably started with good intentions but had there's a lot of things that sort of the good intentions and then they either back fire or back fire or they snowball into something else and 

359.79 360.82 B: right 

360.96 361.90 A: so 

361.14 363.49 B: and i i think it's going to take a um 

363.55 364.61 B: a a 

364.71 368.74 B: certain i don't know if it's going to be a generation that's going t- to 

368.68 379.69 B: be able to change it or if they're actually going to do away have to do away with it i- in order to correct it to what it needs to be um at this point i i kind of feel like it needs to be taken away 

375.95 377.16 A: right 

379.59 388.53 B: um it because of the fact that it is so misused and there's a lot of people who are um 

379.95 380.81 A: mhm 

389.07 391.46 B: you know they're penalized 

391.85 401.15 B: [noise] because of it being in place and i think it would be a lot better if they would just totally delete it from the system and 

394.51 395.71 A: right 

400.09 402.28 A: and try to rewrite something with 

402.64 404.80 A: something with a different type of guidelines 

402.86 404.21 B: (( yeah right )) 

405.10 406.16 B: right 

405.92 407.14 A: i agree 

406.37 420.60 B: right you know and and i don't i don't know if anything like that i have not read anything on it recently i guess because with everything else that's going on right now um it's kind of been in the on the back burner whereas used to it used to be a really big deal 

420.30 421.24 A: right 

421.08 428.90 B: um so i don't know if anybody really has any ideas of that you know with congress doing their new budgets and things like that um 

428.19 429.13 A: yeah 

428.90 439.12 B: i've not read anything i'm i'm not really up on that sort of stuff so i um i've not seen anything in the news or anything recently that that actually speaks to affirmative action 

439.35 446.90 A: oh yeah i was going to say there's bigger there's bigger things going on right now so i don't know if anybody's taking a proactive 

446.93 447.88 B: yeah 

447.31 450.16 A: look into doing something differently or 

450.98 456.19 A: yeah i'm not i haven't the only thing that's been on the news lately has been about the war so 

451.23 452.19 B: right 

456.43 461.12 B: yeah that's right [laughter] that's the only thing that's on there [laughter] oh 

457.66 462.09 A: [laughter] [laughter] really don't have a choice do you 

461.56 475.45 B: that's right well you know and you think about iraq and the people over there they don't have a afir- well i guess they do have affirmative action it's just the fact that their affirmative action is he's in charge and he's going to tell who who can do what [laughter] but 

474.28 475.79 A: exactly 

475.58 488.27 B: ah you know so i guess we we really can't complain too much even though ah we feel like it's a programme that has not done what it was supposed to we still have the choice of being able to go out and do other things so 

488.26 489.30 A: yeah 

488.37 491.76 B: unlike unlike you know the people there so 

491.44 499.63 A: as i say at least we have um we're lucky to ah to talk about affirmative action and the benefits and and the 

500.15 504.18 A: bad sides of it because not too many countries have a choice of 

504.45 514.49 B: right well and you know you think about it and i don't know i'm not familiar are you familiar with the fact that if it is actually in any other country besides the united states 

514.06 515.26 A: no i'm not 

515.27 516.71 B: i don't think it is 

515.42 518.84 A: but i can't imag- as i say i can't imagine that it would be 

518.75 531.17 B: right i think you know they're they pretty much have their hierarchies and it's like ah we used to be a long time ago and we are really the only ones who have actually tried to ah make a b- a better world of it so 

525.31 526.25 A: right 

530.59 532.93 A: yeah make it make a of it 

532.74 544.17 B: yeah we're definitely better off in that sense um and as women you know we i guess we should be happy that it's there because i'm sure at some point i got a job because of it [laughter] [laughter] 

540.08 541.78 A: we're getting jobs that 

541.98 546.63 A: yeah [laughter] because they're saying that women are getting jobs because of it but at the same time 

546.66 547.61 A: um 

547.93 549.76 A: i just i just feel like 

549.78 551.76 A: the person with the 

552.04 554.58 A: more experience or more knowledge or 

554.73 557.55 A: you know should get should get that position 

554.99 556.19 B: right 

557.70 562.72 B: well and i and this is just my opinion and i'm not sure if it's if it's correct or not but 

562.85 564.42 B: i think that 

565.10 569.91 B: there's more emphasis now placed on the ethnicity then there is the gender 

569.68 570.54 A: (( yes )) 

570.53 574.65 B: um you know and i think that that's where it started going wrong 

574.69 575.58 A: right 

574.78 580.42 B: um moreso the just because um we just we have people who 

580.40 590.73 B: um are in positions that when they do get in it because of affirmative action they turn around and they hire other people because they have that ability through the same programme that put them there 

590.65 591.67 A: right 

590.89 599.89 B: and um and i and i think ah you know probably every state has that problem and and even in the state government much less just 

597.52 598.57 A: right
