148.25 148.76 A: probably got 

150.36 153.58 B: yeah there there are um a wide variety of i mean some art house 

153.69 155.17 B: theaters and i'll say some 

156.14 156.90 B: uh just 

157.14 158.61 B: classic theaters that 

158.99 160.07 B: show old movies 

161.23 163.62 B: but i just moved here about a month ago so 

164.76 167.96 B: i haven't been able to get out to many movie theaters in the area 

168.65 169.07 A: ah 

169.18 170.55 B: i just see what's playing 

172.08 172.61 A: well i've been 

173.37 173.80 A: i've been 

181.43 181.98 B: oh 

188.87 189.50 B: oh yeah 

192.14 192.60 B: mhm 

193.27 195.38 B: well i think definitely for movies like um 

196.55 197.17 B: big 

197.84 200.04 B: epic movies like uh lord of the rings 

200.29 200.88 A: oh yeah 

200.82 205.97 B: it's much better to see it in a theater with surround sound and a giant screen 

206.24 206.56 A: right 

206.87 209.53 B: at least you get a lot more sucked in that way 

210.78 211.88 A: i uh 

213.73 215.01 A: watched lord of the ring- 

222.58 227.52 B: i have a pretty decent one with surround sound but i don't have a very large television 

227.79 229.88 B: but we have a d._v._d. player so 

230.34 231.40 B: that definitely um 

231.59 234.82 B: makes the picture quality a lot better but it's definitely not the same ex- 

235.02 235.82 B: -perience as 

235.92 237.07 B: seeing it in the theater 

239.21 240.12 B: i tried to go 

240.59 242.14 B: when i really like a movie like 

242.39 247.46 B: that i'll go to the theater several times to see it just because i know i'm not going to get that opportunity 

248.41 249.07 B: for awhile 

249.75 250.36 A: i've not 

250.61 251.49 A: i've never done 

258.72 260.76 B: you don't like to see movies more than once 

260.87 261.39 A: oh yeah 

262.05 262.57 A: i don't want to 

264.60 267.15 A: i like to see them more than once if they're movies that i would like 

269.38 271.44 A: but basically by the time i get around 

272.69 273.44 A: having the 

274.78 277.21 A: time and energy and wha- and what all 

279.92 280.46 A: um 

282.33 282.98 B: oh yeah 

288.69 289.17 A: first 

293.86 295.12 B: the fellowship of the ring 

295.01 296.56 A: fellowship just before the 

296.72 297.10 A: tower 

297.22 297.64 B: mhm 

298.05 298.51 A: but 

298.48 299.13 B: ah yeah 

300.31 300.75 A: wasn't 

302.85 303.31 B: mhm 

306.32 309.98 B: yeah i think that they they re-released it for a weekend or something 

311.11 311.99 A: but i get 

313.65 314.26 A: but um 

314.57 316.62 A: yeah well i'm i had read that 

325.90 329.26 B: i actually um saw the fellowship of the ring and 

329.49 331.50 B: that prompted me to read the 

332.77 333.37 B: novels 

333.74 334.23 A: uh-huh 

334.00 334.30 B: so 

335.41 335.93 B: um 

336.91 339.41 B: i almost wish i had just seen all of the films 

339.52 339.89 B: first 

341.06 343.26 B: before i read the book because that made me 

344.09 344.36 B: i 

344.64 349.25 B: didn't enjoy the second one as much as i otherwise would have if i hadn't read the book 

353.10 353.76 A: more if you 

353.92 354.19 A: had 

354.64 357.96 B: i wouldn't (( a )) i wouldn't have been comparing it and criticizing it 

357.29 357.65 A: right 

359.90 361.66 A: do you think that particular movie stood up well 

362.90 364.02 B: i think that 

365.93 367.02 B: there was just a lot of 

367.13 369.13 B: stuff that was not in the book 

369.98 370.51 B: um 

371.20 373.88 B: so they added like the stuff with the arwyn and 

374.24 374.76 B: um 

375.20 375.94 B: the whole 

376.68 379.63 B: uh the way that they changed faramir's character 

380.54 381.50 B: and 

381.63 382.52 B: having um 

383.21 383.93 B: frodo and 

385.19 388.46 B: uh sam go to gondor which never happened in the book 

389.19 390.17 B: i mean i think that 

390.45 391.03 B: it was 

391.20 393.50 B: some of the best cinematography even better than 

394.24 397.37 B: in the fellowship of the ring especially when they're 

397.56 398.79 B: they were in the bog 

399.78 400.47 B: but 

400.82 402.27 B: it wasn't as well 

403.63 405.27 B: put together it seemed 

406.61 407.32 B: more 

408.23 409.36 B: choppy than the or- 

409.48 409.98 B: the 

410.58 410.90 B: first 

411.35 411.71 B: film 

412.89 413.74 B: what did you think 

414.01 415.60 A: um i 

416.80 417.94 A: trying to keep them a separate 

418.45 419.08 A: separate thing 

419.53 419.97 A: um 

420.17 420.82 A: i don't know 

420.96 421.52 A: i really 

422.66 423.13 A: you know i miss 

424.17 424.77 A: i i 

425.85 426.19 A: you know 

426.45 427.76 A: oh they changed this 

431.63 432.01 B: mhm 

442.93 443.41 B: mhm 

447.20 448.73 B: yeah it's it's just a great 

448.89 449.90 B: story and it really 

450.37 450.96 B: with you 

451.96 454.59 B: that also i ended up reading the hobbit and 

455.23 456.74 B: that helped me understand um 

457.66 458.59 B: the ending of 

459.58 460.43 B: the lord of the rings 

460.52 460.95 B: better 

461.57 462.35 B: of the book 

462.72 463.03 A: yeah 

463.21 465.44 B: and i i'm very curious to see 

466.17 470.58 B: how they're going to fit all of the stuff that's left in to the last movie i just 

472.95 474.11 A: well it may end up with a 

473.06 473.63 B: um 

474.58 475.06 A: five other 

476.94 480.45 B: yeah i i just think that i would have rather them done that 

480.16 480.52 A: yeah 

480.66 483.93 B: stretch it out into five movies i mean they could have made more money off of it 

484.04 484.42 B: too 

484.80 487.30 B: and and kept the story straight i mean 

488.27 489.90 A: well they didn't know how it was going to be received 

491.46 492.06 B: yeah 

492.46 495.07 B: it it was a huge investment already definitely 

495.43 497.27 A: and i think it moved along pretty well 

497.52 499.80 A: uh i think they did a pretty good job of mak- 

497.68 499.88 B: it did i mean it's still really good 

502.04 502.91 B: i've seen 

503.04 503.50 B: um 

504.81 505.37 B: the 

505.74 507.12 B: twin towers in 

507.68 509.91 B: twice in english and once in french 

511.33 511.65 A: ah 

511.73 513.25 B: when i visited i visited 

513.69 514.59 B: france and 

514.84 515.91 B: some other countries 

516.81 518.31 B: at the beginning of the year and 

519.12 522.27 B: that was really interesting -cause i had already seen it twice in english so 

522.13 522.80 A: so it'd been dubbed 

523.54 524.09 A: rather than 

525.02 525.99 B: it was dubbed 

526.75 529.92 B: and they did not have the sub- and apparently that's how they do most 

530.02 531.05 B: films there because 

532.27 536.65 B: most people want to see it in french and there are some theaters where you can 

537.22 539.02 B: choose whether or not you see it 

539.20 541.84 B: dubbed or subtitled but the popular theaters 

542.68 544.36 B: generally just show them dubbed 

545.03 547.88 B: which is really strange especially watching um 

548.53 550.72 B: sitcoms like have you ever seen the nanny 

552.09 555.31 B: the it's it's a sitcom with fran drescher do you know who she is 

556.46 556.82 B: well 

557.19 558.75 B: she's an american woman and 

559.10 563.89 B: um from new york and she talks like this ah and it's 

563.39 564.30 A: oh yeah okay
