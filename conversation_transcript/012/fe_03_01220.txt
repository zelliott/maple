0.15 1.15 A: (( hello )) 

0.69 2.64 B: hello [laughter] 

1.94 3.40 A: hi i'm jessica 

3.06 4.86 B: hi i'm stacey how are you 

4.60 5.89 A: (( good how are you )) 

5.55 8.33 B: good i guess we have to talk about this topic 

7.97 13.57 A: yeah which is so weird 'cause it's like zero hour i'm like watching the countdown on t._v. 

12.30 15.97 B: i know it's freaky um well i guess um 

16.25 19.94 B: i was home schooled in high school so [laughter] um 

19.21 21.22 A: (( so you don't know [laughter] about the public schools )) 

20.60 23.85 B: well i know a lot about them and i didn't actually um 

24.03 32.06 B: go to one for um well i i went to a catholic school um but then uh i got taken out of it because i was like 

27.75 28.53 A: uh-huh 

32.17 37.36 B: picked on and stuff [laughter] for like really dumb reasons 'cause i just had an accent 

33.46 34.72 A: oh no [laughter] 

37.17 38.46 A: oh [laughter] 

37.41 42.66 B: um so my parents home schooled me um but um 

42.89 47.89 B: then my my two sisters they went to to public schools um 

46.46 47.33 A: uh-huh 

48.03 48.62 A: (( [cough] )) 

48.09 55.87 B: and i think like from what i could compare between like my home schooling experience and like the public school it was like a 

55.96 61.59 B: a weird um like they didn't focus a lot on like writing or reading or anything like that 

61.22 62.35 A: mhm 

61.71 66.09 B: just the basics and then you know what i noticed when i went to college was that 

66.11 73.58 B: a lot of the kids who had gone to the school system in my area so it's not like public schools in general but 

70.76 71.68 A: uh-huh 

73.74 77.08 B: they were like i guess overwhelmed with like the 

77.15 79.85 B: the writing and reading aspects 

79.50 80.78 A: right 

80.27 82.30 B: i don't know what do [laughter] you think 

81.87 86.85 A: i went to public school and my mum's a public school teacher yes 

83.32 84.20 B: uh-huh 

85.19 86.26 B: oh really 

86.86 91.05 A: so um like my was was pretty good with public school 

90.41 91.32 B: really 

91.06 97.49 A: but there's actually like i'm the first person to ever actually go to a well i'm like the first one to ever to go to penn from my school 

97.14 98.26 B: (( oh no kidding )) 

98.16 102.40 A: [cough] yeah and i'm the first like only like the fifth to go to an ivy league school 

102.10 103.27 B: oh wow 

103.38 113.69 A: but it's it wasn't that my school like wasn't up to snuff like it was still there but it's just they never had any recruiters like from any ivy league school come to our school so noone even 

112.29 123.31 B: right and i think that's a problem 'cause there's a lot of kids who have a lot of potential in public schools and they just don't get like yeah i went well are you familiar do you know where franklin and marshall is 

116.34 117.17 A: right 

118.99 120.56 A: exactly 'cause like 

123.85 125.59 B: um in lancaster 

124.24 126.76 A: in philly no in lancaster 

125.79 127.45 B: that's where i went to school 

126.97 127.91 A: oh okay 

127.50 138.06 B: um but i took like well i i partially took a class at ten so um [laughter] i took like one class there a bio class um 

131.61 132.50 A: uh-huh 

136.57 137.44 A: uh-huh 

137.51 142.75 A: yeah i know a couple of people that did that they would just go around ten in high school and then they took like a class 

142.38 145.12 B: yeah um i mean and i 

142.88 143.75 A: (( at ten )) 

145.38 159.07 B: i don't know i mean i guess i i really don't i mean my sisters are in public school now my one sister is in public school in maryland and she is absolutely happy with it i mean the curriculum is terrific she's getting like 

151.93 152.77 A: uh-huh 

159.07 162.94 B: a phenomenal education and she has like um 

163.55 168.18 B: a lot of uh opportunities that wouldn't be available to her at another school 

167.84 168.83 A: right 

168.51 169.46 B: you know 

169.13 174.81 A: i just feel like it it's not even the public private issue it's like completely the area issue 

174.25 175.70 B: i think so too 

175.41 182.79 A: like our area was was pretty good like it was pretty well off like not like not extremely well off but you know like upper middle class 

182.21 183.10 B: right 

182.90 194.99 A: but we just had no exposure to like ivy league at all but then where my mum teaches it's like twenty minutes away but like you cross over a certain highway and you're in like a completely different neighborhood 

191.68 192.56 B: mhm 

194.40 195.64 B: yeah 

195.03 204.40 A: and they have like she has like criminals in her classroom and they always have threats and like she teaches in like a really tough school like a really bad school 

203.96 205.55 B: that's crazy [laughter] 

205.51 219.29 B: yeah i mean i i don't i agree i don't think it's the school 'cause i know i mean i know my next door neighbor was a public school teacher and she was just as good if not better than than any of the um you know private school teachers that i also knew 

218.97 219.89 A: right 

219.30 226.07 B: um so i don't think it has to do with teachers or or anything like that i think it has a lot to do with the area and where these kids are growing up i 

226.04 226.82 A: right 

226.28 228.22 B: mean they probably don't have any like 

228.52 241.76 B: parental support back at home and i mean they're like i guess i think it's like upper marion or something like that has like a really really good school district and like their public school kids get like some of the top scores in the country i think 

241.42 242.23 A: right 

241.86 243.12 B: i'm pretty sure 

243.07 244.48 A: i feel like um 

244.90 246.33 A: it's more like 

246.75 256.45 A: i don't know for the past couple of years the public school system has like catered more to parents and catered more to children because like they're so afraid of getting sued and they're so afraid of getting lawsuits 

255.81 257.06 B: yeah 

256.47 263.48 A: like i know my mum like she had a student like cuss at her the other day and she sent him to the office like that happens it's like nothing 

260.24 261.56 B: oh my gosh 

263.27 264.41 B: yeah 

263.85 268.84 A: and she sends him to the office and nothing happened to him like they don't get detention they don't get suspended 

268.34 278.79 B: no i [mn] one of my sisters was telling me that her um her friend walked into a classroom and like used the f word at the teacher and nothing happened 

278.17 281.67 A: yeah that's a it happens to my mum like all the time and 

281.06 283.37 B: because the parents will just complain 

283.12 285.07 A: (( and the te- like the schools )) 

285.28 297.66 A: they don't back the teachers i think that's the main problem because it's like you're not being backed and you're a teacher you're not gonna have the motivation to do anything about the problem if it's only you against like this whole big world if you don't have your administration behind you 

297.33 298.34 B: right 

298.07 304.49 A: because the administration is so scared of what's gonna happen to them which is really it like shows it reflects on our society 

303.98 304.96 B: (( yes )) 

304.74 307.70 A: that's kind of ridiculous that we live in a world like that but 

307.07 309.50 B: i know [laughter] i completely agree 

309.10 312.78 A: and actually like i'm really passionate about this subject i have wanted to um 

312.79 317.47 A: go into the america america teachers the like the teach for america thing 

316.96 319.57 B: yeah like is that like americor or 

319.23 325.91 A: it's kind of like americor like you have to teach for two years and like you pick out a a sign it's like teaching instead of like working 

325.59 326.53 B: right 

326.74 330.00 A: but my mum like said [laughter] no basically [laughter] 

329.97 332.16 B: because it's dangerous 

331.48 336.38 A: because it's dangerous and 'cause she just doesn't like she's like if you want to be a teacher you could have gone anywhere like why 

335.76 336.94 B: yeah 

336.91 338.81 A: (( but i don't know i act- )) 

338.00 351.49 B: i think i mean i don't i really i mean i don't know if it's [mn] i don't think it's a problem that i mean i guess it's in the the administration stuff in the schools and i don't i'm not really familiar with what's happened lately i know that like the philadelphia schools were taken over by 

351.35 352.41 A: right 

351.76 352.88 B: something 

352.97 355.50 B: um i forget the name of it um 

354.95 357.16 A: it was like a private company i think or something 

356.47 364.60 B: right and i don't know if that has you know anything to do with anything um i mean i'm i've lived in the suburbs my entire 

364.57 372.60 B: like life here in pennsylvania um and then i mean the only personal school experiences i have were in parochial and home schooling 

366.72 367.54 A: right 

372.33 373.39 A: mhm 

372.77 377.52 B: but i mean i've seen my sisters and you know all my friends went to public school 

377.67 380.04 B: and all of them are doing very well 

379.47 380.30 A: right 

380.41 387.88 A: i completely think it's like it's the area and it's actually i think since we've been in school it's changed so much 'cause i know 

383.39 384.28 B: mhm 

388.03 395.29 A: i work on a research study and our study involves going into schools i actually i spent eight hours in a public school in philly today 

394.74 395.88 B: oh my gosh 

395.73 400.10 A: and in um it's just changed so much from like what i remember like 

399.51 400.56 B: really 

400.23 407.29 A: even like i went into one last week and i had fifth grade and i was like moved to tears like because children couldn't read at all 

406.18 407.53 B: oh my gosh 

407.49 412.26 A: like i was sitting there we uh we have like a simple survey to give them and i was reading it to them 

411.91 413.34 B: oh my gosh 

412.92 418.53 A: and it was it was just so sad and like so moving that they couldn't read it was like 

416.26 417.66 B: yeah 

418.41 424.12 B: now do you think it has to do with the actual school or do you think it has to do with their family life or 

423.47 426.42 A: i think it's i think it's a combination of both because 

426.52 427.55 A: like the 

427.73 432.72 A: i don't know the teachers are afraid of the parents because the administration doesn't do anything 

432.79 440.04 A: and so because they're afraid of them the teachers aren't pushing the parents and since because they're not pushing them the parents aren't doing anything 

436.81 437.88 B: right 

439.37 440.98 B: well yeah because i mean 

440.35 444.11 A: so it's like a vicious cycle like one's afraid of the other so they're not gonna 

443.18 450.50 B: exactly 'cause years ago i mean if you were doing badly in school the teacher would contact your parents i mean i remember when i was in 

450.41 465.06 B: parochial and catholic school um if i got a bad grade on a test that test was stapled to a folder and brought home so that my parents could see it um i mean not that i was like doing badly on tests every week but like when it did happen 

459.75 460.75 A: right 

465.15 475.25 B: it was like motivation for you not to do poorly um 'cause you didn't want your parents to be disappointed in you 'cause that meant a lot and now it's like it doesn't even matter 

468.20 469.24 A: right 

472.18 472.94 A: right 

475.20 476.41 A: yeah it doesn't 

475.51 481.75 B: 'cause the teachers are too afraid i mean it doesn't matter if a kid gets a bad grade because um they aren't allowed to flunk kids 

481.58 482.80 A: exactly 

482.83 486.41 A: yeah my mum's gotten like in trouble for failing kids before 

485.87 487.25 B: oh my gosh 

487.35 494.84 A: which is ridiculous 'cause she teaches she'll end up teaching the same kids like in [mn] english eleven twice and like she can't fail them 

493.18 493.83 B: (( oh )) 

494.83 498.90 B: that's nuts and then they go forth into the world [laughter] and they 

497.29 503.83 A: and they just go through and that's how like these kids in this elementary school just keep getting passed on even though they can't read 

503.61 516.27 B: oh my gosh i could not imagine and i mean back in the day everybody was held back you know i mean in i mean i don't agree with some of the reasons why you know i mean i had friends who were held back for really stupid reasons 

509.01 509.90 A: right 

515.53 520.71 A: yeah if you were held back for like ridiculous things like like being too short and like 

518.78 519.74 B: yeah like 

519.80 522.42 B: or if you mooched around in your seat 

522.11 523.33 A: yeah like 

522.63 526.50 B: you were held back [laughter] or something like that but um 

526.79 528.66 B: and now i mean it's just 

528.67 534.55 B: i don't think anybody is or i mean and the kids just get so frustrated and or they just drop out 

534.20 535.32 A: mhm 

534.69 541.82 B: i mean i know a lot of kids in my school district um and the mentality i think is completely different i don't think kids 

542.30 547.92 B: go to school with the intention of like getting anything out of it other than the fact that they have to be there a lot of the time 

547.45 549.95 A: yeah there's [mn] there's no motivation 

549.59 553.90 B: i know [laughter] i feel like i left school in a good time 

553.34 554.59 A: [laughter] 

554.04 566.08 B: you know but i mean my sisters have all done done really well um in school i mean my well my little sister and my other sister um we had some trouble with the public school because she was sick 

557.85 558.75 A: mhm 

565.81 566.70 A: mhm 

566.10 572.05 B: um for two years with disease and the public school was not very um 

572.41 575.75 B: good at dealing with the fact that she couldn't attend school 

575.58 576.48 A: (( oh my [mn] )) 

575.68 583.66 B: like she had to be homebound um and the school wasn't i mean they gave her a lot of hard time and then when she went back to school 

581.00 582.17 A: (( right mhm )) 

583.57 596.16 B: um they were really rough on her e- you know even though it they knew she was struggling to catch up with this material they were very very hard on her when it wasn't her fault and they would the teachers would accuse her of um 

592.46 593.45 A: (( that's really )) 

596.32 599.44 B: said it was in her head and that she wasn't actually sick 

599.51 599.90 B: (( you [mn] ))
