77.49 79.71 B: [laughter] well i 

78.94 81.02 A: (( and i think that that the same holds true for the black population )) 

80.33 94.87 B: this was um i was going to be working with pay phones and the pay phone itself is like weighed fifty pounds and it was in the washington d._c. area and a lot of them were going on to construction sites so 

84.44 85.53 A: (( you know )) 

95.57 97.93 B: yeah i mean and you're talking

106.07 107.32 B: (( you know i )) 

107.63 115.27 B: the position had to be filled by a white woman bottom line they wouldn't take anybody else they wouldn't fill it with a guy 

115.51 117.85 B: they wouldn't fill it with a black woman 

117.98 119.34 B: and um

132.12 133.54 B: (( me i )) 

133.93 139.58 B: (( really don't want to do this because i don't think you ))

160.16 161.05 B: (( yeah )) 

160.45 161.39 A: (( the same thing )) 

162.90 168.61 A: oh i think it extends definitely beyond just black people white people men and women i mean it'd 

168.73 175.79 A: it definitely has to include everybody in the broad scope of humans you know i mean even children because ah 

176.09 178.79 A: there's definitely ageism out there as well i mean 

179.11 186.91 A: elderly people sometimes have a hard time finding a job because of the fact that they're they have to switch gears in their in their ah careers 

186.51 187.75 B: right 

187.07 190.57 A: you know i mean to be a fifty seven year old man 

191.07 198.12 A: well into a an established career and then all of a sudden to have it pulled out from under him you know his odds of getting a job are just as slim as 

198.60 204.02 A: somebody who's twenty three years old and just out of college you know 

203.59 205.75 B: right no i agree 

205.01 208.79 A: except probably going to get beaten out for that job for that twenty three year old 

208.49 209.53 B: right 

210.35 217.26 B: you know there comes a point where they have to look at not just their age but what experience they bring with them 

217.49 218.53 A: yeah 

217.93 223.61 B: you know and unfortunately the older population you know they don't have 

223.75 230.01 B: or don't have the possibility of the l- the longevity on the job like a younger person would 

228.26 229.17 A: mhm 

230.11 231.34 A: exactly 

230.71 235.06 B: but um you know they bring so much more experience with them 

235.63 238.93 B: than the younger person could possibly bring that 

239.22 243.06 B: hopefully the the experience would outweigh 

243.35 249.37 B: yes you know we might only have him you know with us for five years or ten years until they retire but 

247.56 248.45 A: mhm 

251.19 251.81 B: (( so )) 

253.17 253.97 A: hello 

253.26 260.59 B: ha- have you experienced any of it yourself as far as anything that you've been after personally 

260.75 261.77 A: (( mm )) 

261.90 265.83 A: i can't really say that i could tell if i had i mean 

265.84 267.01 A: honestly 

267.34 274.45 A: i'm a young kid that ah i'm i'm twenty five and i change jobs fairly regularly ah 

274.50 276.13 A: actually this past year 

276.53 282.15 A: i ah had the same job for a full year which is probably the longest in my life so far 

282.62 284.66 A: and 

285.06 294.99 A: just shifting around and applying for different jobs i've never really had a hard time getting a job just because i i always know what i'm doing when i get inv- involved in he whole 

295.17 296.07 A: um 

296.08 303.62 A: process of getting a job i mean i've definitely put in my time into interviews and application processes and 

303.99 306.63 A: that i know how to take care of things now 

307.24 309.27 A: just ah being able to make 

310.06 314.09 A: my experiences broad enough that i can apply to a bunch of different places 

314.17 317.38 A: and not having to pigeon hole myself in any one particular area 

317.08 325.04 B: oh yeah have you have you ever thought that you didn't get a particular job because they gave it to somebody else because they felt they had to 

325.71 327.92 A: the thought never crossed my mind 

327.35 328.20 B: no 

328.20 329.98 A: nope 

330.01 332.68 A: my jobs have usually fallen into skills 

333.38 334.51 B: oh okay 

336.49 337.94 B: i've got kids 

338.30 339.89 B: as young as you are 

339.98 341.80 B: [laughter] 

342.67 344.10 B: but that's okay 

345.38 351.30 B: but i just you know i think i think affirmative action is important because 

351.88 353.60 B: it just um 

354.32 359.07 B: for so long things jobs were so stereotyped 

359.54 362.34 B: and and people that really 

362.38 363.61 A: (( yeah [laughter] [noise] )) 

362.81 368.04 B: could do a good job and and were willing to work at it weren't given the chance 

368.78 371.81 B: the you know it it had to come about 

371.55 373.28 A: mhm 

373.55 374.41 B: just 

375.99 378.87 B: to equal things out i guess [laughter] but 

378.20 379.07 A: yeah 

380.99 381.66 A: (( mm )) 

381.92 384.30 B: any other thoughts you have on it [laughter] 

383.91 385.42 A: ah 

385.12 388.19 B: i was just like i don't know about you but it's kind of hard talking 

385.46 386.52 A: honestly 

388.35 393.59 B: you know they just throw a topic at you and then expect you to talk to somebody that you don't even know but yeah 

393.93 398.75 A: yeah exactly um yeah i i'd have to say that 

399.23 402.15 A: i'm i'm disappointed that um 

402.20 405.37 A: we've come to this point in the country's 

405.58 414.45 A: history and ah evolution of culture and everything that it still requires a statute and a law to ensure that people 

415.27 424.30 A: get hired based on their skills and experience rather than whether they're male or female you know it's pretty disheartening society as a whole 

424.62 429.45 A: to know that people will still do that just because there are assholes like that [laughter] 

429.24 438.13 B: right well and and there tend- now because somebody like you had said earlier you know like a a fifty five year old man losing his job 

429.67 430.80 A: you know what i mean 

438.17 443.49 B: for whatever reason downsizing you know businesses closing or whatever 

441.38 442.44 A: yeah 

443.51 444.49 B: um 

445.05 453.07 B: you know that they have to go out there into the work force and compete against the twenty five year olds like yourself and 

453.73 462.44 B: it it just seems so unfair that when and and i'm fifty five myself you know we should be looking at 

463.32 467.25 B: okay another ten or fifteen years and and we could retire 

464.58 467.71 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

467.43 469.76 B: and you're having to start all over again 

469.93 475.15 B: and having a hard time because you have to fight the system so to speak 

476.79 478.48 B: but 

478.55 479.82 B: so does this 

480.05 484.78 B: do we automatically get cut off after ten minutes is that the way this works or do you know 

484.61 496.05 A: i have no idea how this whole study works um honestly i think we just keep talking until they tell us to stop or there's this break in the conversation i don't know the- they're recording us right now i know that 

487.16 488.16 B: (( i don't )) 

495.44 497.67 B: is this your first call 

497.63 499.22 A: yeah 

498.19 499.53 B: yeah mine too 

500.04 501.08 A: [laughter] 

500.76 508.83 B: so i don't really know i mean we've been talking for nine minutes now so i don't know what we're [laughter] sup- whatever we're supposed to do but 

508.48 510.10 A: yeah exactly [noise] 

509.40 511.52 B: i guess we'll just keep talking 

512.58 515.97 B: but ah i don't know what to talk about now i mean i i 

516.36 529.87 B: affirmative action because i like i said it greatly affected me and a result of of me going into that area with the phone company that has been where i worked my entire 

530.29 544.24 B: working life i've drifted away from it periodically but have always come back to the phone company and that's where i am now [laughter] after all these years i started out with them when i was eighteen years old and 

531.68 532.50 A: uh-huh 

536.90 537.47 A: (( mm )) 

544.29 549.31 B: like i said i left periodically had four children and went back and 

549.54 550.51 A: wow 

551.25 556.46 B: i'm still there now i can- i moved down here to florida and 

556.49 565.83 B: the affirmative action thing kind of took over for me again because i i had been away from the typical male type jobs and 

565.98 568.29 B: they offered one to me down here 

568.58 569.45 A: (( mhm )) 

568.82 573.07 B: so i went back into installation and started climbing telephone poles and 

573.45 577.39 B: digging ditches and doing the whole thing all over again [laughter] 

576.91 578.72 A: wow you climb the poles 

578.36 579.68 B: oh yeah 

580.27 581.21 A: still 

581.19 590.10 B: oh no not now no i i haven't done that in in twenty some odd years but when we first moved down here to florida i did yeah 

589.95 591.59 A: wow that's impressive 

591.90 597.25 B: so i i've done it in the washington d._c. area i've done it down here in florida 

597.33 598.91 B: you know i've done it 

597.65 598.77 A: yeah
