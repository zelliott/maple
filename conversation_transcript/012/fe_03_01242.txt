15.45 17.66 A: i live at three hundred tobin drive 

17.80 20.25 A: utah texas seven eight six ten 

22.34 23.50 B: [noise] hi 

23.13 26.41 A: hi [laughter] affirmative action 

23.60 24.32 B: [laughter] 

27.51 28.62 B: yeah 

30.15 41.24 B: oh my opinion on that is i think they sh- should go within not within the company try to promote within the company they sh- they should try if people go 

41.29 49.24 B: want to get hired they should pr- if they get hired and they come in if they're qualified for the position they should get hired for that position that's 

50.08 51.16 B: my opinion 

51.46 57.25 A: yeah yeah i think affirmative action can be a good thing because i know there are people who will 

58.47 60.31 A: still use prejudice 

60.09 61.18 B: yeah 

60.59 62.03 A: in in hiring 

61.79 63.08 B: mhm 

64.00 66.16 B: that's my opinion yeah 

64.38 65.29 A: probably 

69.73 73.54 A: [noise] and we're supposed to talk about this for ten minutes [laughter] 

72.45 75.48 B: (( [mn] [laughter] i guess so i don't know if that's [mn] )) 

74.78 76.16 A: [laughter] 

78.11 83.40 A: well i suppose affirmative action can be abused because peop- there are all kinds of lawsuits by people who 

83.52 84.40 A: (( you know )) 

84.08 87.89 B: yeah they and they sometimes discriminate against the women too 

87.99 89.90 A: this is true [noise] 

90.12 92.04 B: in the business because i 

92.54 94.62 B: because i was let go from a job 

96.37 98.27 A: and you think it was because you're a woman 

97.28 101.82 B: you know i think well it was it was two of us they had to the one girl had more 

101.83 102.84 B: um 

103.64 116.98 B: knew more about the front desk than i did and she and she was full time and i was full time and they couldn't have both of us so they let me go c- because they couldn't ah couldn't put my on part time because they already part timers for the front desk work 

117.61 121.81 B: and they -scriminate because they don't give you raises when they should give you raises 

121.53 123.44 A: yeah 

123.01 131.80 B: and they always give the guys i think they think a guy's more important when they're at the top than a woman is to get the top job they don't think women can handle those kind of positions 

133.03 138.61 A: do you think people still get discriminated against because of their color and stuff in hiring situations 

137.89 143.81 B: sometimes they do because they think some companies think they have to hire a certain of amount of color- the um minority 

143.49 144.44 A: uh-huh 

144.81 153.20 B: and they can't and if they've got a person that's handicapped in the position they can't let they and they they have to let somebody go they're better off letting the person that's 

153.06 162.20 B: can get another job real easy then to k- and keep the one that's got the handicap because otherwise that person's going to say they're discriminated against because they had a handicap 

162.62 164.29 A: yeah that's true 

165.31 169.89 A: yeah i i wonder how many people get jobs because the employers are 

170.22 175.86 A: afraid that they're going to get sued or get you know accused of discriminating if they don't hire 

175.56 176.61 B: yeah 

175.97 177.65 A: a minority 

178.03 180.36 B: yeah that's true too [noise] 

180.84 183.76 B: (( it's hard to say one way or the other [laughter] )) 

182.66 187.23 A: [noise] mhm but it's it's still probably important to to have 

187.31 189.38 A: affirmative action because 

189.46 194.55 A: i i don't know it's it's scary how many people still discriminate based on you know and 

193.91 198.21 B: yeah and the same with wage wise still giving wage earnings 

198.05 199.16 A: yeah 

199.31 203.97 B: they'll give more to one person than because they think they're better ah the guy will get more 

204.17 212.03 B: wage raise and then two people have a ch- can get it and one or the other one gets it and you don't get it it means that they think the guy's a better 

212.67 215.56 B: potential for doing the job better than you are 

216.02 218.76 B: and i think that's wrong to for it to be that way 

221.55 234.85 B: and so companies who give raises real fast and stuff and then we don't get we don't and and the company i work for they don't deserved a raise they give you a raise they didn't go like after thirty days you get a raise or after 

233.83 234.85 A: (( mm uh-huh )) 

234.98 238.44 B: ninety days probation they give you a raise if they think you're 

238.49 239.63 B: (( if they )) 

240.01 247.95 B: evaluate your job and your ability and what you've done and they think you deserve a raise they give it to you if you deserve an honorable mention they'll give it to you 

251.06 253.34 B: but other than that i couldn't say 

253.09 254.31 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

253.37 255.84 B: [laughter] i don't know much [laughter] ab- 

256.26 258.25 B: what to say on that 

258.39 260.06 B: (( affirmative action )) 

261.63 267.06 A: yeah it's sort of a hard thing to talk about for a long time i mean i think you either agree with it or you don't and that's [laughter] yeah 

266.19 267.05 B: (( [mn] )) 

267.64 273.82 B: well i think it's a good policy that they you got to have some way to protect yourself and your job safe 

272.15 273.26 A: mhm 

275.17 284.31 B: i took down on i when i went to do this thing i took down all the information off the compute- off the computer so i have all the questions that they were were going to ask 

283.98 284.93 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

286.32 288.03 B: (( [laughter] but ah )) 

288.08 293.58 B: because i don't have a job and i had to get a job and i would use this as one of my things for getting work 

295.39 296.63 B: do you work at all 

296.60 298.70 A: no i stay at home with my kids 

298.24 301.46 B: mhm and it's a good way for you to make some extra money 

301.10 302.70 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

302.40 307.54 B: that's what i thought too to get back into the working world because i couldn't nobody would hire me 

308.28 310.05 B: (( for what i was doing this )) 

310.32 313.27 B: is the first one i got a call on was this one 

313.67 315.11 A: yeah me too but i 

313.84 315.31 B: (( and i probably )) 

315.28 318.67 A: i didn't actually you know pay that much attention to the topics 

318.55 319.45 B: oh 

318.84 320.48 A: (( because i wasn't well you know )) 

320.36 331.19 B: no i just i took everything off the computer when i d- did it because i wanted to make sure that i have all the information on the stuff so that when they called me i had it right there in front of me [laughter] so i know what it's about 

320.70 322.15 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

331.52 338.08 B: so i know what i'm talking about because they sometimes they give you something and they say if you don't understand what it's about and if you don't want to accept it you don't have to accept it either 

338.14 340.93 A: well i'm just glad it wasn't sports [laughter] 

340.24 342.19 B: (( oh [laughter] god )) 

341.13 344.14 A: [laughter] that was the one i noticed but [laughter] 

346.54 354.79 B: well if they asked about any sports i can tell you about some things but not any [laughter] not a lot of things on t._v. i don't wa- watch a lot of sports 

354.46 355.34 A: (( ah no )) 

357.55 360.41 B: so other than well my daughter ice skates 

360.44 361.63 A: oh really 

361.01 361.94 B: yup 

362.42 365.09 B: but that's not one of the things we talk [laughter] about 

364.47 366.40 A: (( [laughter] well that's a sport )) 

365.17 367.55 B: i don't know how long you can talk on this subject 

367.68 370.32 A: yeah that's what i'm thinking [laughter] 

370.28 371.32 B: (( [laughter] it's )) 

371.72 373.09 B: a hard thing [mn] 

373.42 378.42 A: i'm not all that opinionated frankly [laughter] i mean there there are good things about affirmative action 

375.45 376.37 B: [laughter] 

377.48 384.25 B: do either of you think affirmative action in hiring and promotion within the business community is a good policy 

384.15 394.00 A: well you know i mean it it has its good points but i mean everything has the potential to be abused like with through all the lawsuits people have going on over you know over everything 

389.10 390.35 B: yeah i know 

393.59 394.58 B: yeah 

394.85 396.98 B: i i agree on that one 

396.65 397.61 A: so 

397.37 401.89 B: and there's a lot of companies that freak because they don't get their rates in their company 

401.62 402.97 A: yeah 

402.30 412.97 B: if there's a choice between a woman or a man usually sometimes well once in a while women will get the position but a lot of times the guy gets it because they think he's better qualified for the position than a woman is 

413.03 420.12 B: or it could be because they have to take well they have to give it to a minority because they have to have one minority up in that position 

419.74 421.74 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

420.72 425.06 B: and that's not fair to the person that had the who had the right to it in the first place 

425.15 429.48 A: yeah and i know looking for a job i'm half japanese 

429.34 430.35 B: oh you are 

429.84 433.80 A: and a woman so i always thought you know maybe that gives me a little edge but you know [laughter] 

433.31 434.69 B: [laughter] 

434.20 442.78 A: but i certainly wouldn't you know like file a lawsuit over it or something if it you know it didn't but i i just you know so i don't worry about the affirmative action thing too much i don't know 

437.73 438.98 B: mhm 

442.57 444.36 B: no i have never from 

445.83 452.28 B: when i worked there i was there and i didn't say and i told one lady one time i wouldn't say anything because i didn't want to get myself in trouble 

452.47 454.14 B: so i never said anything 

453.91 455.40 A: mhm 

454.60 459.10 B: she said if you don't speak up you don't get anywhere well i started speaking up and i got more more 

459.17 462.84 B: doings on my job but when they got new hiring in my company 

463.07 468.49 B: the company went and said they'd like to have kept us on but didn't have any positions available for us 

468.52 478.23 B: and the jobs that they were doing they were hiring f- like i was in could do day care but they wanted the day care to do half day care half front desk and i couldn't do both 

478.78 483.06 B: because i didn't know enough about the front desk when they first started out we didn't have as much in the company 

483.20 485.02 B: ah at the front desk to do 

485.26 490.08 B: now they got three times more work to do at the front desk than we used to have 

491.18 492.85 B: so it was a lot tougher 

493.34 494.91 B: (( and )) 

493.34 496.61 A: mhm i actually haven't had a you know a job in 

496.93 497.82 A: gee

501.88 502.65 B: (( mm )) 

502.64 510.19 A: so i- i've been out of the work force for awhile i haven't really had to worry about it i don't know how much difference it it makes you know the affirmative action i don't know how much 

505.86 506.85 B: uh-huh 

509.52 512.11 B: you just got the one or or have you got more than one 

512.02 513.47 A: i have three now [laughter] 

513.03 514.28 B: (( oh you got three now ))

549.30 552.66 B: well this is something you can do on the side when he's taking a nap or 

552.80 555.36 B: (( whenever you have extra time on your hands )) 

554.91 556.25 A: (( yes )) 

556.25 557.98 B: it makes a little extra money 

557.66 559.45 A: just a little [laughter] [laughter] 

558.89 560.32 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

561.28 563.37 B: depending on how often they call you [laughter]

597.59 599.89 B: i that was the easier subject but it was
