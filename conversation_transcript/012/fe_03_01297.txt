146.91 153.23 B: and then but we stayed in touch a little bit until he went overseas and then i haven't heard from him or anything like that 

153.10 154.29 A: right 

155.15 158.08 A: haven't seen him pop up on a p._o._w. list [laughter] or anything 

157.65 160.70 B: but no no he he's a um 

158.86 161.14 A: fortunately [laughter] 

161.00 162.45 B: [cough] he's a sergeant 

162.80 166.28 B: and a mechanic so i'm sure he's pretty busy over there 

162.99 164.14 A: right 

166.27 167.33 A: yeah 

168.43 172.15 A: the um yeah it's kind of it's kind of freaky all the stuff 

172.78 180.77 A: um but [laughter] i feel like i feel like we're we're probably deviating from what they wanna know um [laughter] 

177.50 182.96 B: [laughter] i know well i was like uh so what exactly do you want us to say 

181.73 185.93 A: yeah i was like yeah what do you well how long is it do you know how long this goes on for 

185.45 187.24 B: um ten minutes 

187.20 189.50 A: ten minutes okay um 

188.13 192.01 B: so i think we've got like seven more minutes to go [laughter] 

190.59 193.76 A: okay great okay fine that's good um 

192.51 194.00 B: [laughter] 

194.30 202.76 A: the uh as a matter of fact i just turned on um there's a big thing on there's i guess there's a lot of criticism [noise] so i don't know i can just flip it on now 

202.81 208.08 A: um there was a thing on our local news about a bunch of criticism against the media [noise] 

208.50 221.62 A: about uh [noise] the the things that they're showing on t._v. and it it's funny because i i was just saying that you know i feel like the the news that we get is so sanitized 

221.96 223.11 B: yeah 

222.90 224.71 A: you know it's like 

223.48 231.19 B: but then look at what the they were showing over there about our p._o._w.s and all that you know showing the 

229.14 234.15 A: right i i don't necessarily wanna see you know dead bodies or anything but 

233.41 238.90 B: yeah or the people that they're torturing or keeping prisoner or you know like 

237.33 241.29 A: yeah there's there's a point there's a point where it just becomes gratuitous 

240.90 242.20 B: yeah 

241.59 249.54 A: you know but there's also but there's also this fine line between like them not being up front with their reporting 

250.21 252.94 B: yeah like sugar coating it and everything 

250.35 251.49 A: and 

252.42 263.04 A: yeah and it's just completely like i mean like if you if you get a chance if you get cspan um they run b._b._c. news at night and it's just so much more 

263.13 265.39 A: like not a frontal 

265.42 279.94 A: but honest it's really just more i mean they when they come out and they say like you know we kinda get this big kinda general you know well there's been some people killed you know like this and they're like thirty seven people were killed today 

267.87 268.78 B: yeah 

280.73 284.54 A: you know wh- like flat out they're not showing images 

280.88 282.04 B: oh really 

284.69 288.17 A: you know but they're reporting it as a factual information 

288.01 289.26 B: yeah 

288.65 289.69 A: you know 

289.87 290.94 A: um 

291.00 293.54 A: so so those kind of things um 

293.99 298.99 A: so it's it's a little more yeah like you said it's like sugar coated for us 

298.69 302.71 B: yeah it's like come on just tell us for real what's going on i mean you know 

299.34 300.36 A: you know 

302.35 305.27 A: yeah i yeah i just you know i don't need to see the 

303.69 308.43 B: i mean we know it's a war we can we can take it [laughter] 

306.55 310.85 A: right [laughter] that's and that's that whole thing about how it's just you know 

311.01 316.38 A: i think they they do that too because you know oh they're afraid that the public opinion's gonna swing the other way 

317.75 324.04 A: and uh you know they're they're gonna be up against an even you know bigger you know media crisis 

323.90 325.11 B: yeah 

324.52 326.57 A: um so 

327.40 328.51 A: um 

328.88 336.09 A: but it's interesting i just i guess i should i should be getting into more into the newspaper and seeing what they have 

335.87 346.24 B: yeah i haven't been reading the newspaper at all my dad has he's been he's been saving 'em all the headlines and you know all the front pages from all the newspapers 

338.98 340.17 A: yeah 

346.30 350.67 A: right 'cause it does they do get more in depth 

351.39 355.25 A: they uh you know and in more um 

355.62 360.42 A: it's hard to say objective 'cause everything's owned by all the same media complex it seems 

360.14 361.22 B: yeah 

360.76 371.77 A: um especially for us i don't know about you guys down there but it's like all of our like all of there's only four there's four major radio things here 

372.39 373.56 A: um 

374.52 382.08 A: so all four all four media outlets or all of our media outlets are only owned by four different corporations 

382.41 385.72 A: the newspapers the radio and the t._v. stations 

385.60 386.63 B: oh really 

386.35 400.30 A: and in addition to that they also own like all like the concert venues [laughter] and uh the ticketing agencies and the you know all that stuff so it's like whatever you listen to on the radio those are the artists that are gonna be in town 

400.51 405.07 A: you know and you have to buy through their agencies and those kind of things so 

403.77 404.95 B: [laughter] 

405.21 407.60 A: it's kinda like this big monopoly so 

407.00 409.73 B: yeah i was just gonna say that [laughter] 

409.60 414.34 A: yeah so i think yeah i need to start reading the newspaper more and figuring out more about 

414.69 418.14 A: the radio i'm just i'm totally fed up with [laughter] 

417.41 420.84 B: yeah i don't listen to the radio any more so 

420.30 428.87 A: yeah you know i they're like even my music stuff i get everything off the net yeah so 

429.07 431.29 B: yeah i get everything off our dish 

429.26 430.41 A: but uh 

431.49 433.12 A: right 

432.63 437.14 B: they got these great channels that have whatever genre of music you want 

437.17 438.04 B: and they'll 

437.22 440.66 A: right like d. m. x. satellite satellite radio 

440.09 448.77 B: yeah so you get no commercials they tell you who's playing and so it's pretty cool so it's like i just that's how 

441.12 442.17 A: yeah 

445.50 446.53 A: right 

447.66 449.37 A: (( i have satellite radio for )) 

449.51 450.32 B: huh 

449.57 451.65 A: sorry go ahead 

450.51 451.40 B: (( i'm sorry )) 

451.39 465.67 B: oh well so that's how i get you know like my new music instead of you know usually you listen to the radio and you hear the new stuff that's out but it's like i don't know what's coming out 'cause i don't listen to the radio and so that's how i have to get new music is through that way 

462.89 463.86 A: right 

465.94 467.47 A: right 

466.14 468.61 B: and the internet too i kinda like you know 

468.94 472.59 B: check out like c._d. now and amazon and stuff and 

473.45 476.03 B: that you can listen to stuff on there so 

475.99 478.38 A: right exactly 

478.75 483.85 A: you um have you tried uh internet or a uh satellite radio for your car stuff 

483.83 485.35 B: no i haven't 

485.06 487.05 A: that's pretty cool 

486.44 487.55 B: what is that 

487.71 495.03 A: um it's just a it's just a little unit that you stick in your car you take it with actually with you everywhere um and it's like ten dollars a month 

494.88 495.71 B: huh 

495.18 499.14 A: and it just beams satellite radio into the little unit 

499.03 500.02 B: (( oh wow )) 

499.30 506.59 A: puts it directly into your car and it does all those same things where it brings up the you know the titles and tells you what the artists are and all that stuff 

506.55 507.76 B: oh that's neat 

507.63 512.02 A: so it's like that thing for your for your satellite dish but like in a little compact unit for your car 

511.97 513.06 B: oh wow 

513.97 515.22 A: (( you know so )) 

514.39 516.24 B: oh i'll have to look into 

516.01 518.90 A: (( [laughter] )) 

516.90 519.59 B: that learn something new here 

519.40 524.66 A: [laughter] so the um 

524.81 528.14 A: what uh so what what news station are you watching the most of 

528.35 529.54 B: (( um )) 

530.16 537.54 B: well aside from just like our local channels you know of course like at five and eleven and stuff we'd be watching our local station 

537.70 538.96 B: but uh 

539.64 543.66 B: i think mostly we've been watching like cspan c._n._n. 

545.16 548.24 B: for the most part but maybe m._s._n._b._c. you 

548.34 559.41 A: right it's kinda funny like you know it's like to hear 'cause i've been i flip you know and get that button going pretty fast [laughter] you know 

550.47 551.33 B: (( know you )) 

557.28 562.21 B: yeah well i do too we just took all the news stations and put 'em on a favorites list 

562.15 563.41 A: right 

562.22 567.04 B: so we can just go to that list and then you just sit there and just surf through all the news 

565.58 568.05 A: hit that same favorites right 

567.18 578.79 B: you know and and since most of 'em will sit there for like you know three hours and just loop everything and you hear the same thing over and over and over so it's like oh well you can just surf to the next station and see if anyone's got anything new 

576.59 577.77 A: right 

578.82 590.37 A: start getting the talking head and you know switch over to something else that's what i've been doing but it's interesting to hear like the different perspectives between you know the different organizations 

580.78 581.81 B: [laughter] 

588.67 594.42 B: yeah 'cause each each station will sometimes give you a little different variation on a story or something 

594.15 597.96 A: right or just even just the slant you know 

597.26 599.78 B: yeah or different footage and
