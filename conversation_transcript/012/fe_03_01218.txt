0.20 2.09 A: hi my name's aaron 

1.60 3.84 B: hi aaron i'm michelle 

3.53 5.05 A: hi michelle how're ya doing 

4.60 6.75 B: just fine you wanna go first [laughter] 

6.25 8.09 A: [cough] uh sure um 

8.28 18.80 A: i guess uh wow i just went to a talk on this uh but that was for um for coll- at the college level but i guess if we're talking about k. twelve the biggest problem for me is the uh 

18.82 28.55 A: discrepancy in funding between suburban schools and city schools and that's probably because it's based on property tax and you know there's just not enough funding um [cough] 

22.30 23.47 B: mhm 

28.80 32.01 A: for proper resources in in city schools 

31.71 32.76 B: yeah 

32.13 34.28 A: so to me that's the biggest issue 

34.08 39.30 B: yeah well basically i um wo- worked in the school system for ten years 

38.86 39.76 A: okay 

39.41 44.93 B: so um basically i feel that the problem with um public schools is that 

44.70 56.64 B: the administration they set our children up for failure they set the students up for failure especially with the s._o._l.s because you know they want to start 'em off at a higher level you know with math and 

56.50 63.34 B: um especially with math concentration on math because basically you know we don't teach um 

63.53 69.96 B: the higher level math courses until you get like in middle school well basically in high school or whatever 

69.62 70.54 A: right 

69.96 79.65 B: and it's like you know they want our students by the time they get to college their first year in college to know you know like trig and everything like that and it's like 

79.51 86.45 B: we don't because our kids don't get the concept they don't allow the teachers you know to basically teach the concept 

86.38 101.10 B: of the beginning basics of higher level math dealing with algebra where we can teach it in kindergarten but they don't allow us to do it they just you know allow us to teach basic math you know like addition subtraction multiplication and fractions 

100.68 101.52 A: mhm 

101.06 112.01 B: which is the basics for higher level math but however our kids are losing that concept once they get in middle and high school because it's not replicated any more 

103.85 104.69 A: mhm 

111.70 112.58 A: right 

111.99 125.98 B: so that's why i just feel that our failure as teachers and as administrators are is that we basically don't teach our kids the concepts especially dealing with math that's just you know the biggest failure math and reading basically 

125.52 126.50 A: right 

125.85 128.17 B: in the school system so 

128.94 131.32 B: and ba- you know uh-huh 

128.95 138.64 A: um yeah well well what about the uh [cough] like the standardization of testing especially that's going on more and more in in uh public schools 

137.59 148.95 B: oh yeah because um basically it's like you know before when we were in school you know school went a little bit smoother because our teachers you know we were allowed to stay to the basics 

148.73 151.87 B: now it's like we're teaching to the test 

151.43 152.33 A: mhm 

151.64 166.29 B: you know especially dealing with the s._o._l.s we're teaching to the test of you know how students are supposed to learn history and how they're supposed to you know [laughter] learn math and science and social studies and it's like 

166.15 175.13 B: you know we're not able to be creative you know what i'm saying because you know they sit up there and they tell us they train teachers and say oh you know well you know 

168.63 169.97 A: right right 

174.94 186.46 B: every student learns differently well we already know that in order for us to teach that way where you might be a auditory learner and the other student you know might be a visual learner 

178.18 179.11 A: right 

186.44 196.50 B: where they're not allowing us the s._o._l.s aren't not allowing us to teach it to them that way they just it's on paper this is what's on the test this is what you need to learn 

196.34 206.41 B: by the time you train them to take the test they may pass and they may not and then when they go to the next grade guess what they've forgotten everything 

206.25 219.53 B: you know that that test material was on the year before and then that means the following year you gotta pick up the last year's part and then you gotta tackle the new year's part so [laughter] 

213.67 214.54 A: right 

219.04 220.09 A: yeah 

219.50 225.88 B: it's like make you know it's a backward thing that you know the administration is putting on the teachers and everything 

225.57 230.57 A: yeah now instead of trying to reduce class size and having more individual tests 

229.82 241.30 B: exactly exactly they're pushing more students into the class sizes they're enhancing them and then you have one teacher that has like thirty five to forty students in the class 

241.11 251.18 B: you know and you know you try you like you know you pass by the ones that are you know getting it you know that are being able to you know work with one another 

250.86 251.74 A: right 

251.02 256.86 B: but the lower level you know especially my um my students that are like well are called the 

256.84 271.32 B: mid level to lower level learning is a more challenge because it's like when they go home you know whatever i've taught in school if they didn't get it that day and they go home to do homework guess what mum and dad doesn't know how to do it either 

270.89 271.97 A: right 

271.34 275.71 B: you know and then they comes to us the teachers and like hey you know 

275.92 280.64 B: why isn't my child learning this and it's like there is not enough time in a day 

280.26 281.48 A: yeah 

280.79 285.60 B: you know so it's becoming very difficult [laughter] 

284.66 296.18 A: i know and i actually i was i was always good at standardized testing but i actually think it's you know it hurt my learning because i would just you know do well on technical tests and memorize things real well but like 

295.95 309.22 A: i didn't necessarily learn it and it didn't really you know enable like the type of i was i would i would always i would always do well like math and science based tests and like language like technical stuff but you know now that i'm in college i finally get the chance to 

303.34 304.53 B: mhm 

309.09 323.32 A: like study some other things you know i [mn] basically to stay whatever i was good in i mean that [laughter] that's kinda you know but but then i realised that the you know there's a lot more out there and i think it kind of closes off it stunts people's like you know opportunity to really find what they're good at but 

310.91 311.86 B: right 

313.54 314.47 B: (( [laughter] )) 

322.07 323.37 B: right 

323.77 327.97 B: and i think it turned like i was turned off by math because 

324.03 324.83 A: so 

327.92 340.60 B: throughout my whole i had i've never realised until i got in college that i had a anx- anxiety toward math and that's because when i got to third grade and [laughter] i was supposed to learn fractions 

334.45 335.36 A: right 

340.59 351.89 B: i didn't learn it 'cause i di- i just couldn't comprehend it i i didn't get the concept of it so i went through i actually skated by through math all you know i made cs and ds 

351.54 352.52 A: mhm 

351.74 357.10 B: and then when i got to college guess what they made us take an e- a entrance exam 

357.20 367.53 B: and [laughter] i flunked it you know on that part i passed the language and the reading part but on the math they were like guess what you gotta go to remedial [laughter] 

359.44 360.40 A: yeah 

366.95 368.33 A: right right 

367.46 374.73 B: so it took me longer you know to get outta college you know where it should have been four years i actually didn't graduate 'til five 

374.54 387.19 B: because i had to start in a lower level you know math then when i got to the higher level math i still had to get you know a tutor you know to help me through the geometry or the trig part or whatever because 

377.88 378.78 A: mhm 

387.10 391.74 B: it's just that difficult to me and i think you know um 

392.11 404.64 B: when you know you know teachers or administration they don't look at you know the difficulty that students have in school you know especially where their abilities are you know where 

404.72 405.69 B: hello oh 

405.52 407.35 A: yeah i'm listening [laughter] 

406.04 409.48 B: okay i don't know if it clicked out or not [laughter] 

408.68 410.05 A: no i'm listening 

409.63 410.83 B: oh okay 

410.74 416.72 B: but um you know basically it's like you know you have to start with those children you know where they get 

416.50 427.50 B: you know where your ability or strong point could have been you know like reading or math or whatever somebody else's you know their downfall could be in a totally different subject 

419.43 420.36 A: right 

427.24 428.13 A: right 

427.54 438.13 B: and if you don't you know give that child the opportunity you know to um you know enhance their abilities where they're lacking it you know it's gonna they're gonna fall short 

437.86 438.75 A: right 

438.11 452.21 B: and like i said in the beginning you're setting them up for failure because like in the statistics um it says like ninety five percent of college freshmen end up flunking out of school or going on academic probation 

452.26 453.23 A: mhm 

452.26 455.01 B: you know their first semester of college 

454.80 456.23 A: mhm 

455.92 457.21 B: so 

456.58 463.66 A: yeah it it also results in the cutting of funding for you know other things like music and art and stuff like that 

462.25 473.99 B: oh yes yes because it you don't enhance those skills you know like those artistic abilities you know for drawing or dance or music when you cut those out like you know 

468.85 469.76 A: right 

473.93 481.50 B: you're not giving that child you know all you're doing is giving them academic academics you're forcing academics on 'em they're not allowed to 

481.28 489.07 B: express their creativity where people aren't realising your creativity flows over into the academic world too 

488.76 489.79 A: right 

489.19 503.33 B: you know that helps you music helps you with math because of the scales and things and then dance you know that helps you with other you know reading or other abilities that you know you could produce through that so 

502.68 504.67 A: yeah and then 

503.78 505.96 B: yeah that's true [laughter] 

504.90 517.02 A: [mn] i know and then i just think like in general it's you know it's if even if you do well it just it just makes people not not as thoughtful and that i don't think it really works for democracy you know to let everyone just sort of like 

515.19 515.96 B: mhm 

517.04 519.00 A: you know sort of like be like 

519.31 523.76 A: just learn to the test and not and not really you know think for yourself and all that stuff 

522.54 524.42 B: right exactly 

523.66 534.49 A: and uh and not many people even if you're good at it like i was it doesn't really create an interest in in school and learning you know i mean i you know i still like to learn on my own and stuff but it you know it's like 

529.59 530.52 B: right 

534.69 538.94 A: you the the point of going to school is not to just pass a test 

538.32 540.16 B: right exactly 

539.21 539.93 A: so 

540.13 551.68 B: and now they're realising you know with technology the kids that grew up between the eighties you know and then well actually the nineties really you know they're like into computers and 

551.48 562.94 B: software i mean look at all these different companies and stuff coming up that's being run by younger you know um students or younger people because they're so interested in technology 

562.60 563.51 A: right 

562.90 576.72 B: and now they're saying oh well we need to incorporate technology through business and through school you know because it works hand and hand and so it's like and then the other thing too that i look at because i work for the military 

571.31 572.36 A: mhm 

576.74 586.35 B: you know when you go overseas and you look at the scores for the students in japan or germany or different things like that you know america's always looking at oh well 

586.35 599.89 B: germany and uh you know japan is doing this well we gotta get on board and do this well guess what they started their kids when they were like two and three years old teaching the math skills and the reading skills and the lang- 

596.25 597.44 A: right
