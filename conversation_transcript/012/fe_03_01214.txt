0.23 1.96 B: hi i'm rhonda 

1.58 3.05 A: i'm julie 

3.22 7.62 B: uh uh what is wrong with the school system um 

8.01 21.51 B: i'm not a parent but i feel that as as someone who has been in the school system i i think that there needs to be more uh parental involvement in the school systems 

22.06 30.18 A: uh i am a parent and i have three teenagers and um i'm not very involved in the school system insofar as i don't go to 

30.16 41.09 A: uh parent teacher meetings um i do check regularly that my kids have done their homework but i- in general [mn] and this is um something i've thought a lot about lately i feel like um 

41.25 56.23 A: americans don't understand what a bargain they're getting in [mn] in public education that it's you know basically funded by property taxes we we pay a very small percentage of our income uh towards our children's education whereas in other countries they are paying a much much higher 

56.13 65.49 A: percentage of their income either directly by paying fees or um through taxes as well and i think that the quality of our education really suffers because we're just not 

65.51 78.12 A: uh we're not paying our teachers enough we're not um kids aren't in school enough days during the year and uh supplies and resources are severely lacking in a lot of schools so that's 

77.09 78.05 B: (( mhm )) 

78.54 89.56 B: oh i agree and uh you know when i was uh growing up um within it seemed like every two or three weeks we had half a day off because 

89.46 94.09 B: you know the teachers were having some type of instructional 

93.53 94.65 A: mhm 

94.02 106.18 B: uh thing and that that really uh bothers me because i'm wondering okay where is my you know where are children's educations going to um 

104.70 106.47 A: yeah oh i agree 

106.43 107.33 B: (( uh-huh )) 

107.28 118.55 B: uh now i personally don't think uh schools should start until after labor day but here they have 'em starting before labor day and then you automatically 

118.38 128.55 B: uh get the you know whole weekend off you get a long weekend um and like you said every it seems like every two or three weeks at least here in um 

122.31 123.44 A: mhm 

128.45 133.78 B: the uh metro detroit school system uh i'm in the music system 

133.22 134.15 A: mhm 

134.19 138.19 B: uh we're you know they're they're having a day off um 

138.07 151.64 B: not for parent teacher conferences uh but this is you know for you know enrichment uh of for the teachers now i don't know exactly what is being taught 

140.86 142.04 A: right 

147.22 148.30 A: mhm 

151.41 159.78 B: uh or if it's you know something you know well yeah if it interests me i would would attend but you know 

159.82 167.49 B: i i don't know what work is really being done uh in these uh in service training and uh 

165.92 167.11 A: right 

167.96 174.93 B: and so like [sigh] you know are they goofing off or whatever and at what expense to our children [noise] 

174.53 180.96 A: yeah now i i used to be on the other side of it and i was teaching in the public schools and i remember those in service meetings and 

180.95 186.18 A: um for the most part they were a waste of time although i- if you have the right kind of um 

186.15 188.22 A: supervisor who 

188.08 195.18 A: carefully plans these kinds of um depa- departmental meetings um so that you're with your your colleagues in your field it can be kind of 

194.96 208.29 A: refreshing and rejuvenating to be together to kind of bounce new ideas off and you can kind of go back into your classroom with a few more tricks up your sleeve that was that was useful when we were made to sit in front of speeches by 

201.87 202.82 B: mhm 

208.07 213.92 A: uh school administrators or videos about the latest technique in you know 

213.85 224.15 A: teaching learning disabled kids it wasn't always uh geared directly towards what we needed so it was hard to feel an- like you were getting any benefit from it so 

223.57 224.29 B: oh 

224.45 225.31 A: i think 

224.57 225.42 B: (( as a )) 

225.41 226.23 A: go ahead 

225.61 235.16 B: as a as a teacher do you feel that maybe more hands on training would have been better than to sit and listen to someone 

234.91 241.27 A: oh definitely one one thing that we've done in our department recently for example is we've um had 

241.34 251.29 A: teachers um actually go and visit the classrooms of other teachers who are in the same level i teach english as a second language teaching at the same level um 

251.21 263.45 A: even maybe co teaching for a little while uh and and it was made possible by the two salaried people who are on staff going and and subbing in in the classes of those teachers so that they were free to then go on 

263.34 272.58 A: our teachers found that much more helpful than going to a staff meeting it just it was very hands on it was right in the classroom and it really made a difference in um in the 

266.66 267.48 B: (( mhm )) 

272.97 275.74 A: in the use of time for that particular teacher 

275.62 276.59 B: yeah 

276.07 290.23 A: in in terms of the public schools i don't know whether um most teachers find those in service meetings useful at all in fact when i was there it didn't seem like it at all and the and meanwhile the kids are home they're chatting on the internet they're not doing their research projects they're not 

290.14 302.23 A: you know really engaged um academically at all and they lose a lot of time i feel like my kids learn in one year what other kids in other countries learn in half a year it just we waste so much time 

297.70 298.29 B: (( [cough] )) 

300.17 301.01 B: (( oh yeah )) 

302.30 309.79 A: and uh and i really really am sort of discouraged with my own kids' lack of what i consider an adequate education 

309.63 321.35 B: oh well i i can understand uh your your point of view um because you know like you said you know the kids don't spend enough time uh 

321.54 334.29 B: granted i don't like to see kids you know bogged down with so much homework and stuff um or have to constantly depend upon the parents but um 

326.43 327.61 A: mhm 

332.62 333.59 A: mhm 

334.45 344.72 B: yeah yes they they should be uh learning uh more uh i i think some of this stuff should be more optional than 

344.65 359.08 B: uh uh required um although i think there should be more emphasis in in certain subjects [mn] for all children not just [mn] gender you know related um 

344.71 345.62 A: mhm 

354.28 356.13 A: (( mhm mhm mhm mhm )) 

359.38 366.63 B: i personally do not believe that um spanish needs to be taught in elementary school 

364.61 365.77 A: (( i i feel that )) 

366.18 367.35 A: (( there is something more and more )) 

366.73 375.02 B: uh i think uh you know if you come to america and you live here you need to learn the language and why should we 

374.94 381.80 B: uh cater to you other countries don't cater to us if we're there for any length of time 

381.23 383.80 A: (( people are becoming um hearing disabled )) 

382.95 391.24 B: if anything if any language m- my i would want my child or any child to learn would be american sign language 

390.76 392.00 A: mhm 

392.04 393.05 B: (( if )) 

397.66 404.29 B: not completely losing their hearing and i think that is something i'd rather see my children doing 

399.97 400.90 A: mhm 

403.72 405.63 A: yeah yeah 

404.37 410.52 B: or or my niece and nephew uh [laughter] yes i'm very american [laughter] 

406.12 407.14 A: mhm 

407.30 408.32 A: well 

409.56 411.11 A: mhm [mn] 

411.23 417.97 A: yeah and i just noticed that in in my travels that in in countries where teachers are well paid 

417.81 421.62 A: there is just a higher standard that they hold themselves to 

421.45 435.80 A: the teachers a- are generally brighter and more well educated in a in a sort of roundabout sense as well as in their specific field you attract a higher caliber higher caliber of person to the teaching field if you can offer um some kind of competitive pay 

435.74 438.39 A: we are often in our schools we are getting 

438.25 446.20 A: people who just barely got out of college uh and just barely squeaked into a teaching um program 

446.06 456.05 A: and some of them are practically right out of high i mean they're twenty two years old and they're already being thrown in the classrooms where they've got a hundred and fifty kids to deal with a day i think it's ridiculous i think we should be 

455.95 470.64 A: um training teachers t- to get their masters degrees getting recruiting people who are truly interested in their fields and and t- and teaching as well i think that that the biggest um influence that teachers had on my life were those from 

470.54 481.33 A: um t- teachers who were really excited about what they were doing and who weren't burnt out weren't feeling put upon weren't feeling really taken advantage of and being paid under 

481.29 486.39 A: severely underpaid when you log in all the hours they spend at home correcting papers et cetera et cetera 

486.39 500.59 A: um it's really kind of a shame it's it's an embarrassment to to our country that weren't not um rewarding our educators um i- in in a way that really reflects their ability and and the the work that they're doing 

500.68 515.25 B: oh yeah definitely it is you know and why should teachers have to pay out their own money to purchase supplies and other items [mn] that are really needed in the classroom uh 

509.19 510.62 A: mhm 

511.01 512.25 A: mhm 

513.87 515.25 A: mhm 

515.23 524.50 B: a- and the- they waste so much i mean we're we're in the middle it seems of of a big scandal uh in the detroit public schools uh 

523.21 524.24 A: mhm 

524.47 527.20 B: in regards to those things um 

527.06 533.41 B: uh the uh administrators i'm not talking about the teachers but the administrators who um 

533.25 546.80 B: abuse the you know uh travel allowance and stuff like that you know or or use a um uh uh school owned charge card to to make purchases that aren't even related 

537.54 538.64 A: mhm 

543.76 544.79 A: right 

545.67 553.85 A: right no there is that there is accountability with the administrators yeah we have way overpaid administrators in our district too and and teachers are 

554.14 563.02 A: are underpaid it's really um i think contributing to the general d- decline of you know equality of the education that kids are getting 

559.46 560.36 B: mhm 

560.84 561.69 B: uh-huh 

562.84 577.05 B: well yeah yeah and that and that's another thing you know i i feel that teachers should be rewarded uh when they when they do uh well i believe they do need to be reprimanded uh 

569.38 570.33 A: mhm 

577.20 587.97 B: you know and not you know like okay you're you're a you would have to really do something real serious to me to be fired immediately um 

586.54 587.63 A: mhm 

588.41 599.89 B: but uh i i feel that if if parents were more involved and i'm not talking at the elementary school level i'm talking junior high senior high school uh i don't think 

594.97 596.12 A: mhm 

598.11 599.19 A: mhm
