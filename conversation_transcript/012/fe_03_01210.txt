4.19 5.20 B: hi i'm 

5.39 6.40 B: (( how are you )) 

6.31 7.20 A: good 

7.91 10.23 B: oh so did you get the topic for today 

10.05 11.06 A: yes 

11.21 14.07 B: so what do you got to say about it 

13.74 14.69 A: well 

15.09 17.22 A: i really don't have a best friend [laughter] so 

17.29 24.40 A: you know i have a a a several friends but not anyone who i would say was necessarily my best friend so 

24.56 31.56 A: i would say that i would um agree to it because i wouldn't really have a person that i would not be speaking to [laughter] 

32.00 37.29 B: [mn] even though you are offered a million dollars you would like to keep your friend rather than taking it 

37.07 38.37 A: right 

38.93 47.88 B: i mean what makes i mean w- what makes you say so like i mean it should be something more than that i mean a million dollars is not uh such a small amount right 

47.28 48.38 A: right 

48.27 51.68 B: yeah you can make your own business and then like you know 

51.59 52.63 A: mhm 

51.71 54.49 B: you'll live the live the way you want to 

54.35 56.02 A: mhm that's true 

56.08 60.89 B: so but still you want to go for uh just a friend like you know just one friend 

60.31 61.48 A: mhm 

62.72 74.02 B: well even when it comes to me when i would say the same like you know today there might be a million dollar today but like you know after some days it might go but you know a friend is for- always forever 

66.38 67.29 A: mhm 

73.80 74.90 A: that's true 

74.65 76.49 B: (( right i mean you )) 

75.33 76.38 A: that's true 

76.53 86.48 B: know whenever you ask someone like a friend like you know it can even be or what do you say you can make ten more million dollars if it's like close to you and you have the all the self control 

86.62 87.60 A: yes 

87.70 88.74 A: that's true 

89.47 100.18 B: so but still if you are offered a million dollar like you know do you do you still gonna think for a moment like whether you're gonna take it or like still gonna go for a friend 

99.58 102.38 A: yeah i think i'll think about it for a minute [laughter] 

102.41 103.21 B: [laughter] 

102.45 105.30 A: it'd be hard not to uh har- be had not to yeah 

105.36 107.76 B: [mn] you- you're gonna take a million dollars 

109.97 111.05 A: no 

112.17 113.46 B: (( no are are you gonna )) 

113.49 122.81 B: (( like uh take your friend or like you know are you gonna think for some time whether you know a million dollars is very large or that you can spend and then going for it )) 

120.18 121.52 A: (( oh yeah )) 

122.24 125.75 A: yeah that's true but it'd be something to think about because 

125.94 131.85 A: you know but uh uh but a friend is worth more than than money you know 

132.01 134.28 B: but do you have a family of yours 

134.30 135.32 A: mhm 

135.42 142.27 B: uh what if you can't helping them whether like to go for a million dollars or like to keep your one friend 

141.25 145.29 A: well yeah that's true yeah i probably would discuss it with them yes 

145.62 152.46 B: (( yeah what in case like if they're gonna force you like you know a million dollars is really worth it like you know you can always go for it )) 

152.25 162.61 B: make your own business or like you know there's the rest of your life without worrying for anything what are you gonna thing about then i mean if your family puts down some kind of pressure on you 

162.94 164.63 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

163.04 166.45 B: so [mn] take the million dollars what are you gonna do 

166.36 171.69 A: yeah that's true i i don't know that would be kind of a hard situation to be in too 

171.80 184.93 B: yeah i mean you you not worry about anything or about your kids like you know even their life is all set you'll see you got a million dollars you can like you know put them wherever they want to wal- what kind of whatever kind of education they want to 

177.08 178.09 A: mhm 

180.21 181.35 A: mhm 

184.77 186.08 A: well that's true 

185.02 187.60 B: and all those things yeah so 

187.45 190.51 A: yeah there's a lot to think about isn't there a lot of different uh 

190.75 192.30 A: different things that 

192.87 194.40 A: uh you would uh 

194.43 198.14 A: you would need to think about before you answered too quickly on that 

198.39 201.04 B: yeah so you won't be directly like 

201.13 206.51 B: uh going to pick the friend and then like you know dropping this million dollar offer right 

206.08 207.21 A: mhm 

206.83 215.33 B: (( yeah but there's so many things like you know you can think about whether if you have a million dollars or whatever what are the options that you have to like mm so uh )) 

215.64 217.17 A: yeah that's true 

219.29 222.12 B: (( do you work somewhere or like )) 

221.90 222.99 A: mhm 

223.61 224.48 B: okay 

225.23 237.35 B: so but still like uh probably you won't be having any kind of debts or like you know you don't really need the money i guess so by the way the decision you are making that you know you would go for the friend rather than a million dollars 

234.19 235.05 A: yeah 

237.07 241.31 A: mhm that's true yeah that could that could change your lifestyle a little bit there 

242.07 242.94 B: pardon 

242.69 247.20 A: that you could you could uh have a having a million dollars could change your 

247.21 251.30 A: your uh you know like maybe you wouldn't want to work any more you know 

251.54 254.67 B: (( yeah that- that's one thing like you know you can always like )) 

254.61 266.92 B: it and like you know probably either like or just live the way you want i mean like you know go on for vacation you need not worry about your like uh monthly pay checks and like you know 

261.19 262.15 A: mhm 

266.78 268.43 A: mhm that's true 

267.38 269.19 B: and those things so 

268.79 269.67 A: mhm 

269.95 280.11 B: and even when it comes to your family they need not worry about anything like for in fact they can invest in something in [mn] or probably if you are planning to come up with your own business 

280.08 281.19 A: mhm 

281.00 285.37 B: this can like be a very good investment whatever the amount you give 

285.62 289.22 B: so just dropping your friend should be working right i mean 

289.76 290.50 A: (( mm )) 

290.11 300.33 B: you you can always get a friend i mean if you are a very good person even if you drop one fr- uh person like you know [mn] was it that was really a very close to 

297.21 298.43 A: yeah that's true 

298.46 299.28 A: (( you could )) 

300.00 300.99 A: mhm 

301.41 302.40 A: that's true 

301.58 303.65 B: and then like yeah it's 

302.42 303.89 A: you could make new friends 

304.12 309.32 B: yeah if you are a very good person it shouldn't be a tough thing to for you to get a friend one more new friend 

308.71 310.40 A: mhm that's true 

310.54 311.57 B: yeah 

312.05 317.97 B: so you never thought about this so you just went for the friend and then like dropped the whole of the million dollars 

318.32 319.22 A: (( mm )) 

320.24 325.44 A: uh-huh i hadn't i hadn't really given it a lot of thought until this you know topic came up so [laughter] i 

325.59 326.57 A: (( don't know )) 

325.78 326.64 B: (( okay )) 

326.86 329.35 A: it's hard to decide what you would do on that 

329.74 331.56 B: yeah that's right i mean 

331.88 336.96 B: [mn] for a moment like when when directly a question uh like this is put across across like 

336.79 350.20 B: a- anyone would say they want to go for a friend but later on if you think about the pros and cons of like [mn] having a million dollars or having your friend like you know probably i would say a million dollars is a better option 

349.97 350.97 A: mhm 

351.24 358.55 B: (( i mean thinking about uh you know how you can live the rest of the life i mean how old are you how old are you now )) 

356.17 357.26 A: that's true 

359.35 362.62 A: that's true to have that financial security 

362.84 365.28 B: (( yeah financial security )) 

363.21 364.53 A: and it could mean 

364.72 368.59 A: yeah it could mean more than just uh one friend would to you you know 

368.69 369.98 B: mhm 

369.33 372.42 A: that's true you know you can have other friends 

372.23 374.01 B: yeah 

372.61 373.68 A: that's true 

374.57 387.32 B: and of course like when you automatically get the money people au- automatically come to you i mean th- that's the kind of background which i've come from like you know whenever you have the money you always get people around you and they can always 

383.24 384.19 A: mhm 

386.48 387.52 A: that's true 

388.50 398.57 B: i mean you you just call a person for a vacation and you know you both can get closer and then like you know become very good friends even if you lose one friend like you know you can always go for one more [mn] 

388.51 389.47 A: mhm 

397.83 398.87 A: that's true 

399.21 400.20 A: that's true 

399.66 401.49 B: (( how old are you now )) 

401.72 403.17 A: uh forty four 

403.55 404.64 B: forty four 

404.33 405.26 A: mhm 

405.25 413.49 B: yeah see if you get a million dollars you not think about working any more you can retire probably take a voluntary retirement from your job like you know 

409.85 410.67 A: (( oh )) 

412.66 416.69 A: yeah that sounds good i'd like that [laughter] [laughter] 

414.99 415.99 B: (( [laughter] )) 

416.21 421.67 B: (( yeah and especially when you have kids like you know you need not worry about anything anything about them )) 

421.38 425.89 A: mhm yeah that that would be a a big uh relief yeah 

424.67 434.30 B: yeah you you can send them to the ve- i mean the [mn] whichever school they want to even though accept you for for a very expensive school or very expensive college 

429.58 430.64 A: mhm 

434.04 435.88 A: (( mhm that's true )) 

434.88 436.68 B: (( can always send them to )) 

437.56 441.97 A: that's true that would you know that would be something you know your family is uh 

441.82 442.98 B: mhm 

442.38 446.30 A: is very important to you you know maybe more important than a friend would be 

446.42 450.16 B: (( yeah and financial security that that's the keyhole there i mean you )) 

449.20 450.23 A: mhm 

450.33 451.94 A: mhm yes 

450.36 451.19 B: (( know [mn] )) 

451.43 461.45 B: pro- probably if you are given a chance for that you want to have a million dollars or do you want to leave your family then probably taking the family would be better than taking the million dollars 

461.24 462.82 A: mhm yeah 

461.79 465.38 B: but probably a friend won't be that important i believe 

464.73 470.87 A: yeah that's true yeah i uh your family would be a little different situation there you would definitely 

470.90 471.87 B: yeah 

470.96 474.18 A: want to choose your family but a friend you know 

474.18 475.96 B: yeah that's right 

475.34 476.45 A: that's true 

476.58 477.90 A: i think so too 

478.35 486.76 B: i mean at least from my point of view i'm i'm just like twenty five i mean i'm [mn] just like i'm still a student i've been working somewhere part time and all 

486.49 487.41 A: mhm 

487.20 490.41 B: probably i would give importance to the money especially 

490.35 500.63 A: yeah yeah well yeah you've got a lot of things uh ahead there that that would really help you uh to get you know going in with your career and things 

491.87 492.98 B: (( but i mean )) 

494.82 496.09 B: (( yeah )) 

500.66 510.38 B: mhm [mn] uh yeah i go to a university you know i pay so much of fees and like you know i try to all get them back from my assistant from my part time job 

501.32 502.37 A: you know mhm 

510.16 511.07 A: yeah 

510.80 516.44 B: so probably [mn] money would be the more important factor for me than a friend 

515.86 517.45 A: yeah that's true 

517.35 522.32 B: yeah i don't need to slog down all the time like you know study and wor- work at the same time 

521.87 522.88 A: mhm 

522.52 531.27 B: if i had money i i can like you know totally put all my uh i mean i can be dedicated to my studies and like you know put all my efforts just for the study 

528.80 529.77 A: right 

531.15 540.47 A: yeah that's true that that can make a big difference you know in how you're doing and things yeah you ha- you don't have the financial worrying and things 

534.51 535.42 B: yeah 

539.88 541.73 B: (( mhm )) 

540.62 542.53 A: and the time and everything 

543.10 546.14 A: to be you don't have to work part time or whatever 

546.45 547.61 B: mhm 

546.53 548.85 A: yeah that can make a big difference 

549.56 559.83 B: yeah so i mean at least like you can you can like you know i mean take off or leave from the office like you know go wherever you want to 

559.58 560.42 A: mhm 

560.10 567.11 B: need not work all the all the day or whatever slog like anything in fact you can spend more time with the family 

564.24 565.42 A: right 

566.85 572.18 A: that's true that's true and that you know that is uh very important because 

572.32 574.47 A: you know you don't want to spend all your time working 

574.77 576.88 B: mhm yeah 

575.54 577.47 A: you know that you know that 

578.05 584.44 A: and and sometimes uh for financial reasons you need to you know you you have to work more than you really want to 

584.48 585.63 B: mhm 

585.01 588.16 A: and so you know if you had a million dollars you wouldn't have to [laughter] 

588.01 589.28 B: [laughter] 

588.68 590.53 A: that can make a big difference 

590.35 591.44 B: yeah 

590.66 591.52 A: mhm 

591.77 599.89 B: yeah [mn] if it if it was a small amount like uh it it was a small amount offered and then like if you are given a choice between a friend and then the money
