361.86 373.24 A: yeah i can't remember what it was and this is a small county and i usually know a lot of people around here like i said it's farming area but i don't i can't remember his name now it was just in the paper a few days ago 

366.38 367.65 B: [laughter] 

368.33 369.51 B: yeah 

373.10 374.30 B: oh really 

373.71 377.63 A: yeah well if you hear of anybody that's from sydney ohio it would have to be him 

376.50 378.79 B: yeah there's probably not too many so 

377.99 379.83 A: because this is well 

378.82 381.08 B: i'll keep my eyes out [laughter] 

380.17 392.55 A: there's not a lot of ah of um ah church latter day saint church members around here um this is um it's a it's there's a lot of ah protes- a lot of catholic churches um 

385.83 386.77 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

390.78 392.25 B: catholics yeah 

392.58 396.12 A: luther and methodist ah kind of gospel you know that 

396.23 399.46 A: so there is not very many people that belong to that church 

399.53 400.62 B: yeah 

399.93 407.03 A: so if you know one from sydney it's got to be that one [laughter] but it but the the townspeople are helping him earn money 

401.78 405.39 B: (( [laughter] )) 

407.01 408.85 B: oh gosh that's neat 

407.49 410.87 A: yeah yeah other churches and stuff are helping him 

410.83 412.00 B: that's neat 

410.91 416.94 A: helping him so yeah it is it's really cool so i guess we better start talking about affirmative action um 

416.79 418.64 B: (( oh yeah affirmative action )) 

417.21 420.43 A: i know absolutely nothing about affirmative action 

419.66 422.24 B: yeah i'm not into that whole 

422.58 429.40 B: affirmative action thing so yeah [laughter] they they said that i'm like oh shoot 

425.47 427.06 A: (( [laughter] oh well i )) 

428.88 438.94 A: yeah i had to stop and think about what it was for sure isn't it when you um you have to pick and select as far as across racial barriers for your 

432.89 435.65 B: (( what am )) 

435.93 437.35 B: (( yeah )) 

439.85 442.20 A: for your company isn't that what it is 

440.17 442.13 B: i i i 

442.21 447.77 B: i honestly do not even know like i i thought it had something to do with um 

444.16 445.27 A: i think that's 

448.22 453.86 B: like um war and stuff but then didn't they say something about 

452.35 453.12 A: (( it )) 

453.97 456.93 B: groceries or something i don't know 

455.38 456.38 A: (( no i )) 

456.94 461.15 A: think i i think affirmative action is like if you have a a place of business 

461.11 462.00 B: uh-huh 

461.18 464.96 A: that you need to hire um a certain amount of um 

465.03 465.94 A: um 

466.00 470.71 A: blacks ah you know a urb- or whites you know it depends on on 

468.35 471.61 B: oh certain races and and stuff 

471.25 475.86 A: yeah it all depends on how predominantly what your area is whether you know racially 

476.69 490.09 B: well like like in utah like there's not it's not a very it's mostly the um caucasians so like i mean hispanics all like can get jobs here and stuff i don't think it's a huge problem in utah 

483.05 484.20 A: right 

489.63 491.42 A: yeah it's not here either 

490.18 491.02 B: but 

491.14 496.85 B: yeah like but i i bet when it gets more southern and the southern states it's probably a bigger problem 

496.23 501.74 A: well i think in the larger cit- cities is that's why i said that at the beginning i think in the larger cities 

501.70 503.67 B: that's where they need to worry about it 

501.86 502.74 A: there 

502.94 505.65 A: is where it's very important um 

505.87 515.48 A: to even out the job situations you know ah that that that was just my my really first impression of of when he said that's what it was about 

508.83 509.92 B: yeah 

513.04 514.01 B: yeah 

514.39 524.36 B: well it if it is over that i mean i know a lot of high school kids who can't get jobs because um older hispan- older hispanics have the jobs which high school kids would receive 

524.12 525.10 A: yeah 

524.39 529.14 B: and so like i mean in that way it could be bad for a city big cities as well though 

528.76 529.80 A: yeah 

529.18 535.54 B: but like i mean i don't think every sh- every it should go the job should go to the person who's better qualified 

534.52 538.07 A: qualified exactly i agree with you i agree with you 

535.89 536.75 B: yeah 

537.37 548.01 B: it it i don't think race should really race or sex should even come into play but whoever's best qualified but with employers nowadays that's like the other thing they really look at is 

539.72 540.67 A: yeah 

542.45 543.36 A: yeah 

546.91 547.75 A: yeah 

548.27 551.06 B: like what they look like and what not but 

550.55 551.89 A: yeah 

551.28 561.81 B: if they're a good employer they'll hire who's best and i mean i don't think it should be that they're a woman or a race it should just whoever's best qualified 

561.12 574.60 A: yeah i think and that would be best interests to the person that's doing the hiring too i would think [laughter] and and like you said about high school kids not being able to get jobs and you know because the older older hispanics have those jobs 

565.52 567.22 B: yeah definitely 

574.64 580.38 A: um though don't you think maybe the older hispanics have more experience than high school 

580.46 581.42 B: yeah 

580.81 585.26 A: yeah i mean that's prob- you know that and so that is kind of a a good thing in a way 

585.09 587.36 B: yeah definitely 

585.82 590.11 A: you know i sup- if you're at it from a the business end [laughter] 

589.17 596.55 B: yeah yeah it's true and like and they think they can pay the hispanics cheaper which the hispanics usually do take for cheaper 

596.01 597.16 A: yeah 

596.57 599.95 B: but like that's the attitude but i i don't know the equal 

597.36 598.15 A: (( it's ))
