0.91 2.03 A: hi 

2.17 3.48 A: i'm kimberley 

3.61 5.18 B: hi i'm nancy 

5.05 7.38 A: oh good at least i got a female [laughter] 

7.27 8.43 B: [laughter] 

7.77 11.53 A: [laughter] i'm not sure that really matters but anyway [laughter] 

10.91 11.85 B: [laughter] 

11.30 22.94 A: [laughter] but females sometimes have a little bit more understanding ah and as far as the answer to their question i don't think it's a good idea at all actually because it gives a false sense of security to people 

23.20 29.58 A: but ah anyhow that's my perspective on it and what's your perspective my dear [laughter] 

29.80 30.88 B: um 

32.22 34.93 A: [noise] you understand what affirmative action is and everything 

32.55 33.40 B: well 

34.21 35.56 B: yeah 

35.17 39.46 A: okay well i just didn't know i don't know how old you are so i it's hard to know that [laughter] 

40.31 41.46 B: um 

43.84 47.80 B: i think it can be a good thing but not if it's 

48.33 49.36 B: um 

49.41 55.95 A: well the i think the idea that they started out with what they were trying to do was probably a good thing but the problem is is that 

56.14 61.57 A: like most things it usually gets taken way out of context of what it was initially supposed to be 

61.49 62.94 B: right 

61.72 64.71 A: and now it's basically 

64.83 68.57 A: not ah helpful to anybody all it is is a 

69.17 71.84 A: creates a problem and ah 

72.46 76.46 A: (( sorry i was looking for something while i was talking ah but ah )) 

76.97 79.06 A: i don't know i don't i just don't think that 

79.17 88.40 A: it gives people a false sense of security of who they are and it gets them hired for their color of their skin or whatever but then when it comes down to doing the work 

88.52 95.48 A: businesses suffer and so do a lot of other people because they've got somebody in there who's not qualified to do the job 

95.53 97.14 A: and that's not a good thing 

97.22 98.39 A: (( so i don't )) 

97.24 99.78 B: [noise] right i agree with that 

99.39 112.05 A: yeah as someone who is a business owner i just don't agree with hiring someone [noise] just because they have a certain color of skin i don't agree with not hiring somebody because of the color of their skin either but at the same time 

112.06 113.21 B: yeah 

112.30 122.56 A: if they're not qua- if somebody who's white is more qualified at the job than someone who's black then i want the person who's more qualified for the job regardless of the color of their skin 

122.79 129.23 A: if they're black or they're asian or whatever i don't care you know [laughter] but ah anyhow um 

126.73 127.84 B: yeah 

129.50 131.93 A: um but that's basically 

131.99 134.29 A: my perspective on it i think that they can 

134.44 136.31 A: (( very easily ah get )) 

136.44 137.64 A: (( caught in the cycle to where they )) 

138.17 150.81 A: just get caught in the cycle where they just get a job it's kind of like our government jobs these days which is a really bad situation because they've got people in there who know they can't get fired and so they just 

151.08 153.00 A: don't really work [laughter] 

153.43 156.56 B: right i think it's kind of outlived its purpose you 

156.87 158.09 A: yeah well 

157.35 158.28 B: (( know )) 

158.15 169.63 A: it's and it's causing lots of problems these days because as a business owner y- you get people in here ah well even not as actually as a business owner as much as a ah 

169.65 176.81 A: the county jobs and stuff it's like the social services is really a lousy job o- o- o- lousy 

177.75 187.82 A: community these days i don't know what you do or whatever and i'm certainly i'm not trying to throw any cold water i don't know what you do so i guess i better hold on and ask that question 

188.50 190.89 B: oh no i'm a student 

190.07 193.86 A: [laughter] oh okay well you sounded young but i didn't know 

194.10 196.53 A: exactly how young what are you studying 

196.75 197.93 B: geography 

197.58 203.88 A: oh well now that's an interesting ch- ah thing but ah um 

199.74 200.77 B: yeah 

204.17 207.46 A: and what are you planning to do with geography 

207.60 209.87 B: ah hopefully something in meteorology 

209.82 220.58 A: oh okay well that's all good that's good that's a and we can always use people who are who pay attention to the the weather formations and everything out there so 

220.92 234.44 A: and who know what they're doing [laughter] because there are enough of them out there who don't know what they're doing but [laughter] [laughter] since i call the weather bureau almost every day to find out what to expect that day it's kind of nice when they actually get it right [laughter] 

222.70 223.89 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

224.06 225.71 B: [laughter] 

225.73 227.10 B: yeah [laughter] 

233.67 235.41 B: right 

234.26 238.20 A: but ah unfortunately you also can't control what 

238.87 243.46 A: that things happen and stuff that changes overnight sometimes and 

243.69 250.07 A: but anyhow ah now the going back to the the topic at hand or whatever ah 

250.27 262.10 A: it's like right now the social services department um i i had been on welfare several years ago when i lost another business and ah basically got treated like i was a criminal or something 

262.11 263.49 A: and 

263.25 264.11 B: hm 

263.63 268.01 A: and there were a lot of people in that s- structure who 

268.87 281.10 A: they weren't as interested in trying to help you get out of welfare as they were interested in having you follow their rules which makes no sense whatsoever [laughter] to me 

280.51 282.60 B: yeah 

281.23 294.52 A: [laughter] because you know they'd have it set up to where you virtually you're stuck being on welfare because there's no way to get out unless you really are willing to take some chances and ah 

294.71 298.00 A: and and that's why i say that the ah 

298.51 299.29 A: (( you know )) 

299.39 300.42 A: having 

301.79 307.09 A: i can't think of the name of it now the well the topic of conversation i can't think of the name of it um 

306.48 307.20 B: um 

307.95 310.19 A: it's like it just slipped my mind um 

309.47 310.95 B: [laughter] 

310.29 311.66 A: (( but ah )) 

311.75 320.45 A: basically having it so that they if someone can get hired for the color of their skin its' really scary because you get people into an office especially in 

320.58 324.86 A: ah where social services and other things like that and it so that they 

324.81 335.66 A: they they're basically guaranteed affirmative action that was the name of it but ah that they're guaranteed their job just because they have a certain color of skin the problem with that is that 

335.63 341.97 A: they can get in there and then they then nobody can get rid of them and get somebody who can actually do the job properly and 

342.53 352.45 A: ah especially in governmental positions and stuff like that but it's a really scary place to be because they have people's lives in their hands and 

352.60 356.05 A: if they don't know what they're doing then we're in real trouble [laughter] 

355.75 359.39 B: right it's really really bad when you're turned away 

356.51 357.77 A: but ah 

359.62 362.63 B: from something that you know so much about just because 

359.77 360.96 A: yeah 

362.69 364.75 B: you just happen to not fit the quota 

364.43 379.12 A: exactly and ah i kn- i mean fortunately i've never personally been in that situation just simply because i've generally gone out and gone into my own business because that's what i like to do but ah i think that a lot of people 

379.63 383.86 A: are more willing to just get a job that will 

383.95 396.36 A: be there and they just want something that's safe and dependable that they don't have to deal with any risk and ah unfortunately a lot of them aren't willing to actually do their job they just want a job 

396.20 403.27 A: that pays them and they want to do what they want to do in the process and that's one of the reasons this country has 

403.13 411.21 A: got a lot of the problems it does is because people who've gotten where they wanted depend on the government to take care of them instead of them taking care of the government 

410.94 412.64 B: yeah 

411.92 423.95 A: [laughter] [laughter] which is a little scary but ah anyhow a and and i i don't mean to i i'm forty four i'm just curious as to how old a student you are are you in your tw- 

414.49 415.77 B: yeah it is 

423.18 424.78 B: i'm twenty three 

424.39 429.74 A: oh okay so you're in your early twenties so you're are you a senior at this point then 

429.63 430.80 B: yeah 

430.21 432.74 A: okay so you're you're getting close to 

432.83 437.78 A: to getting out and getting into the to the real world [laughter] 

437.01 439.87 B: yeah yeah hopefully just one more semester 

438.37 439.72 A: so to speak 

440.14 444.14 A: and a- are you in school ah what area of the country do you go to school in 

444.28 445.24 B: illinois 

445.08 453.16 A: oh okay well now that's interesting are you planning to stay in illinois or are you going to move out to another area of the country 

453.42 456.45 B: well my husband and i would like to go to texas 

456.51 457.92 B: just because we 

456.86 459.41 A: (( oh well that's where i'm from [laughter] )) 

458.53 460.04 B: oh really 

459.42 465.74 A: yeah i'm from dallas originally so ah and lived down south of austin for a long time 

460.33 461.87 B: (( oh wow )) 

465.80 466.65 A: (( ah )) 

466.87 476.03 A: you'll find some interesting weather there [laughter] in all different sections of the c- of the state because they have various different weather patterns in 

469.97 471.12 B: yeah that's 

475.96 482.22 A: the different areas ah my family lives or my parents live in dallas and i have sister who lives in amarillo 

482.23 493.88 A: and ah i've lived down close to the austin area and in in curville and several other areas and i lived in lubbock for three months which was as far as i was concerned a 

493.79 500.11 A: a a the pit of hell [laughter] [laughter] because it's all desert and there is nothing there to do 

495.60 497.31 B: [laughter] 

499.96 501.83 B: (( oh really )) 

500.50 506.26 A: but uh i was also eighteen years old and had no car that summer so it was really bad 

504.91 506.96 B: oh yeah 

506.26 516.47 A: really bad place to be but ah you know i i they're evidently i mean my sister and her husband are out there in amarillo which is pretty much just the same thing but 

516.74 521.21 A: i wouldn't want to live down there ah what area of texas would you ah thinking of going to 

521.27 523.58 B: um dallas actually 

522.66 528.20 A: oh okay well then you'll be okay because it that has seasons and it still has ah 

528.30 529.94 A: a lot of ah ah 

530.84 532.81 A: um what am i trying to say um 

533.29 535.06 A: [sigh] ah 

536.15 537.37 A: they have 

537.46 546.99 A: the warm and stuff now be prepared for the humidity i don't know how how humid it is in illinois but ah you're going to have a lot of humidity in dallas [laughter] 

546.63 550.31 B: oh yeah i'm from southern illinois and it gets really humid here 

549.86 557.14 A: okay well and it because one of the reasons i'm glad i moved from te- i'm i live in california now and ah 

550.88 551.58 B: (( so )) 

557.35 567.61 A: would never in a million years go back [laughter] to texas [laughter] i don't want to go back and be and my mother in fact my mom and i had a conversation a couple of days ago and she says 

559.90 561.99 B: [laughter] 

567.39 571.97 A: well are you sure you don't move back to texas and i said not in a million years thank you [laughter] 

571.30 572.24 B: [laughter] 

571.95 585.99 A: i said the only way i'm moving back there is if god tells me i have to [laughter] [laughter] no way but ah [laughter] because i don't like the humidity and i mean it's humid year round so there's no y- you don't get away from it it's like 

575.52 576.65 B: [laughter] 

585.92 599.15 A: ah you get off the airplane in the in the airport and it's an indoor i mean i'm sure you've been to d._f._w. or maybe haven't been to d._f._w. it's an indoor airport so you get off the plane into the indoors and you can still feel the humidity the moment you step off the plane
