0.61 2.39 A: michelle jordan 

2.21 4.58 B: hi my name's lucia shima 

5.62 9.82 B: and i guess we're supposed to talk about if affirmative action's a good idea or not 

9.23 10.65 A: i guess so [laughter] 

10.32 11.29 B: okay 

11.51 14.61 B: um well i don't think it's a good idea 

14.91 21.71 B: i think people should get in on the um merits of of what how good a job they do 

21.94 25.41 B: ah especially if it's something that's real technical that would involve 

25.71 30.49 B: um safety and stuff like that if somebody's not paying attention or not doing a good job 

30.85 36.06 B: and they just got the job because they were you know female or whatever that's not fair 

36.14 37.38 A: that's true 

37.04 38.04 B: (( [mn] )) 

38.41 41.26 B: and i think it probably was useful a 

41.35 51.40 B: long time ago when people couldn't think of certain groups as having certain kinds of jobs but i think now if you can prove that you can do it you should be able to have a shot at it 

50.67 51.59 A: mhm 

52.45 55.15 A: i think it's a little different if it's in a college 

52.47 53.42 B: and 

55.84 56.99 B: say that again 

56.65 59.97 A: i think it's a little different if it's admissions to a college 

59.66 63.63 B: oh you think that that ah minorities i mean that there should be ah 

63.55 67.55 A: affirmative action when it comes to admissions to a college 

67.61 68.88 A: because 

68.89 70.71 A: ah minority groups 

71.26 77.85 A: in general are um lower income and go to a poorer quality school 

78.84 83.40 A: and i'm not saying the m- you know the majority of like you know 

83.84 88.17 A: so they would need that little foot up to get into a better college 

88.36 98.59 B: i think well i think if they have if they have ah good grades that they should have more help with getting in for financial and stuff you know yeah but i don't think 

88.40 89.13 A: (( or )) 

96.40 97.32 A: right 

98.60 103.16 B: that they should have you know for every ten um 

103.20 108.42 B: i don't know for every ten of one kind of group there they have to admit three of the other kind of group 

108.53 112.93 B: and the three could just be anybody but i do think that guys from lower income 

113.16 114.08 B: um 

114.87 120.10 B: situations should have more help getting into college to pay for it 

119.89 120.81 A: true 

120.49 125.59 B: yeah and and have more work study or whatever but i worked my way through college myself so [laughter] 

125.77 128.00 B: you know i can i know it can be done [laughter] 

127.55 129.75 A: right and no it definitely can be done 

128.66 129.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

130.05 137.27 A: and i would agree with that just not necessarily the minority but the lower income i i guess is what i would mean 

135.68 136.60 B: yeah 

137.01 150.36 B: yeah because you're you're right minorities do tend to fall into the lower income areas but if you made it more help for people that have a low income but have really good grades they should have a leg up i don't care if they're purple green or 

146.48 147.31 A: right 

150.16 151.53 A: absolutely 

150.91 152.27 B: hermaphrodite 

151.94 154.35 A: [laughter] that's right 

152.38 153.44 B: [laughter] 

154.94 159.17 B: [sigh] ah [laughter] do we have to talk about this the entire ten minutes 

158.57 162.63 A: i'm not sure ah this is the first call i've i've done 

162.36 163.51 B: me too 

163.13 165.32 A: [laughter] this is interesting 

163.93 164.60 B: (( di- )) 

165.01 168.66 B: did you hear about it on or how did you hear about this 

168.24 175.42 A: um i believe that i was on volition it it's um a mystery shopping website 

172.42 173.60 B: mhm 

173.95 179.60 B: i i know what it is yeah because i i got it from lyla's ah what is 

175.77 176.61 A: okay 

180.72 181.65 B: (( it )) 

181.75 184.14 B: there's a yahoo group it's lyla's 

183.76 185.01 A: lyla frances 

185.04 186.26 B: yeah 

185.65 186.39 A: yeah 

186.31 191.88 B: and so they were all the people were meeting each other you know like oh i i've seen you on the website 

192.71 193.54 B: (( [mn] )) 

193.24 195.40 A: well interesting tell me your name again 

195.20 196.88 B: lucia shima 

196.79 198.87 A: okay mine's michelle 

198.61 199.66 B: mhm 

199.02 200.94 A: do you do mystery shopping also 

200.77 201.64 B: yeah 

201.41 202.29 A: okay 

202.46 203.64 A: [laughter] 

203.04 208.69 B: so i guess everybody's doing that and ah lending their voice and their accents to this survey 

208.53 211.41 A: it's neat i've never done anything like that before 

211.18 212.67 B: me neither [laughter] 

212.06 218.63 A: and interestingly enough i'm a i'm a college student now and this topic of affirmative action came up in class 

218.68 219.77 B: oh cool 

219.27 231.15 A: and um ah one of the girls that sat beside me who is just i mean there was like five of who were one hundreds we made one hundreds in the class and and the girl that happened to sit beside me was also a minority 

231.18 235.60 A: and she was totally against affirmative action which surprised me 

235.67 246.46 A: and she said basically what you said that um you should be hired based on your qualities and that affirmative action can keep a minority population down in a sense 

246.24 255.28 B: well it's sort of an insult too it's like you only got in because you're hispanic or something like that and not because you're the best person and people want to feel like 

249.73 252.03 A: right absolutely 

255.34 269.12 B: they're good and they're valued and um they're being recognized for being a cut above the other people and so i really believe in people earning their way through things by by their qua- qualities and and their 

269.11 273.48 B: gifts and not just because of what they look like or you know where they got born 

273.09 274.06 A: right 

274.23 286.71 B: so yeah she's right um i i've heard that um some black people feel like that's a put down too that somehow it just keeps them down like oh you poor black man we have to even help you in college because you're so you know 

285.90 287.94 A: [laughter] 

287.30 296.32 B: yeah but i you can turn it on its head and make it you know we have to do all these things for you and aren't we nice and it makes us feel good because we're the big white man or you know 

295.67 296.82 A: yeah 

296.43 298.80 B: i'm not a big white man but you know what i 

298.14 299.20 A: yeah 

299.39 300.41 B: (( mean [laughter] [mn] )) 

300.46 302.34 A: no and i think that's true 

303.07 309.68 B: and i think being in c- college this mystery shopping would probably be an excellent way to make some extra bucks here and there 

309.48 310.43 A: it is 

309.99 312.97 B: i did all kinds of stuff when i was in college too 

313.70 325.05 B: and in fact i did ah surveys and stuff i'd follow up for health people who fill out filled out a health questionnaire and i went door to door and stuff it was it was sort of like this i guess [mn] 

322.12 323.23 A: oh really 

326.20 334.84 B: and ah it was all the people that hadn't answered the questionnaire and so and i had go to some pretty rough neighborhoods it's kind of like being a census taker 

334.50 335.49 A: really 

336.46 346.06 B: and then yeah i did the census too ah last year since last yeah i do all kinds of stuff just because it's neat and interesting and fun and 

338.92 340.99 A: oh really [laughter] 

345.41 354.61 A: oh i love it i like to do different things to get stuck in the same old thing that's the only bad thing about graduating is that i'll actually have to get a nine to five job [laughter] 

354.18 355.77 B: (( mm yeah )) 

355.18 357.31 A: [laughter] that'll be the worst thing 

357.56 360.83 B: if if you really care about what you're doing it's really cool 

360.51 367.29 A: it will be yeah i hopefully hopefully i'll i'll yeah i'll work my way up to doing what i want to be able to do you know 

366.31 376.34 B: yeah you always start on the bottom i went i went to college twice because the first time i graduated was something that didn't really turn out to be a good useful thing to learn ah to 

375.52 376.22 A: what 

376.46 378.51 B: social welfare [laughter] 

378.05 381.79 A: that is what i'm sitting now in sociology [laughter] 

379.29 380.48 B: oh [laughter] 

380.50 391.76 B: well well my minor was in sociology and my major was in social welfare and um ron- i was in california and ronald regan was governor then so he was cutting back all the programmes and 

391.28 392.57 A: (( oh )) 

391.84 395.68 B: if you only have a bachelors you pretty much were just pushing paper 

395.38 396.37 A: right 

395.75 400.88 B: and and i had this fantasy i'm going to go out and help poor underprivileged people and i'm you know 

400.96 402.91 B: like joan of ark or something 

402.32 404.66 A: yeah [laughter] 

402.95 407.68 B: yeah then i had to do i had to do case work and stuff you know as a 

407.94 410.28 B: work work study hours i think 

409.72 410.52 A: (( mhm mm )) 

410.37 416.11 B: and most of the people were trying to play the system and get free money and not do anything 

415.77 416.76 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

416.15 428.80 B: and i i started really i thought i don't want to help these people i don't like them which was and i thought i don't like the way my a- my attitude about these people how can i help somebody you know i'm being superior to them that's not nice it's not right 

429.43 432.11 B: [mn] and so i worked for 

432.81 435.08 B: about four years and then i went 

435.30 441.13 B: back to college and um got a bachelor of fine arts and interior architectural design 

441.01 442.17 A: really 

442.39 445.21 B: and it's what i should have done all along because i 

445.24 449.09 B: even when i was a kid i was always drawing floor plans for houses and 

449.33 457.07 B: and making furniture and stuff for dolls i never played with the dolls i made up furniture for the dolls and their little clothes and stuff and curtains 

454.11 455.46 A: oh my goodness 

457.75 459.56 A: so do you do that still now 

457.87 458.89 B: (( and )) 

459.73 463.72 B: yeah i've been doing it for like twenty two years 

463.28 464.51 A: wow 

464.23 471.89 B: and um i've got i've i've always worked on the side out of my house on top of having a regular job 

472.31 482.98 B: so when i got remarried and i moved out to iowa um nobody around here really hires designers you know they're they're more down home people than they don't have a lot of big airs 

482.62 483.60 A: right 

483.33 490.25 B: and they like to be very thrifty on their money so i don't have a lot of work on that so i do a lot of other stuff including mystery shopping 

489.98 491.67 A: right yeah 

490.65 493.90 B: and i had a i had a baby at the age of forty seven so 

493.60 494.79 A: really 

494.71 498.06 B: yeah so i wanted to stay home with him and um 

498.34 500.15 B: anyway it worked out real well 

500.57 503.17 A: well we have quite a bit in common then don't we 

502.62 505.86 B: [laughter] yeah well i don't know where you are but

507.52 508.55 B: mhm 

508.60 509.66 B: mhm 

513.90 518.15 B: oh just just don't get personally involved i think that's probably what i did 

517.97 525.42 A: well that's going to be i think that'll be the hardest thing for me because um i wear my heart on my sleeve and so 

525.68 528.65 A: th- woes of the every day world really get to me 

528.36 530.31 B: oh are you a pisces 

529.91 533.35 A: um no i was born in november so i'm 

530.93 531.67 B: [laughter] 

533.11 534.20 B: scorpio 

533.62 535.19 A: yeah yeah 

534.90 536.66 B: well that's yeah that's similar 

537.53 548.32 A: so i know that you know seeing seeing people hurting always hurts me so that's going to be the hardest thing i i actually want to go into social work and children yeah 

538.06 538.91 B: (( [mn] )) 

545.98 547.75 B: i i would work with kids 

547.99 559.11 B: but then um in fact w- well my we're involved with social workers now on the other end of it because my son has had some behaviour problems so we have family therapy at the house and stuff 

559.32 569.35 B: and they're supposed to do i i'm guessing like thirty cases they're supposed to do that many cases and they're doing sixty and seventy cases and they're really really burned out 

568.73 570.48 A: there is no way 

570.12 573.49 B: and i've got we've got some good people working for us that i 

573.63 576.05 B: i've met all kinds of people
