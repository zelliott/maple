53.06 56.00 B: well i would say here in the u._s. 

56.65 65.10 B: probably the the biggest problem that we have is that the teachers no longer have control over the classrooms 

65.01 66.35 A: oh they don't 

65.74 69.45 B: no because they um they you know they it's 

69.57 74.60 B: you're not allowed to punish the kids and um

104.20 110.66 A: well i think the i think generally they do um but i think that's probably because um 

110.69 119.67 A: i don't know things don't seem to be as violent i think the kids up here feel more pressure to get into um a really good university 

119.74 123.04 A: and i think that might have make them [laughter] 

123.32 124.85 B: make a difference yeah

145.34 149.64 B: [noise] now that well the federal government has cut funding to that states 

149.46 150.71 A: mhm 

149.98 150.84 B: um

233.00 236.15 B: and um i think that has a lot problems 

236.44 243.70 A: ah well i i i think up here one of the problems that might also just be because um do you know there's so much um 

237.07 238.10 B: (( where )) 

243.63 257.18 A: i mean i don't know how it was when you were going to school but when i seem to when i was young last century [sigh] a long time ago but um oh from high school um

264.22 268.10 A: oh b- i mean when you went to high school did didn- 

268.19 273.92 A: high school for you start at like i don't know eight thirty or nine in the morning and it end at three 

272.40 274.71 B: (( yeah yes )) 

274.05 282.49 A: and you went between you know you you usually went i think nine months or whatever but now all my teachers all my friends who are teachers 

278.80 279.77 B: exac- [noise] 

282.39 283.52 A: also 

283.38 285.21 A: are complaining because 

285.00 299.36 A: some of the schools now start at eight and they go until two and some of them schools start at you know nine and go until four and some of them are on these wacky systems where there's seventeen weeks on and three weeks off and 

299.51 300.52 A: they just 

300.03 304.98 B: oh where they go they go to work all or they have to work all year the teachers 

303.88 312.68 A: oh and yeah and there's some of them yeah some of the teachers some of the school boards have gone to all year school boards now i don't know if you're a student and you're moving from one 

312.73 323.73 A: school board to another school board that can't be [laughter] very easy i can't figure out how all these kids are learning the same amount of stuff in the same amount of time if they've got all these different school schedules 

323.15 332.22 B: they yeah you're right they i don't think they could you're right and then like if they start at eight and don't um and finish at the same time 

325.35 326.35 A: no 

332.05 339.25 B: as the one that starts seven or seven thirty they're getting less edu- they have to be getting less education any way you look at it [sigh] 

332.10 333.08 A: right 

338.89 350.71 A: yeah i and i think actually one of my one my ah teacher friends was telling me that the actual problem is not so much with the school boards it's with the bus companies the bus scheduling companies because of the busses 

348.92 352.38 B: oh okay yeah we're having bus problems too 

352.14 360.15 A: yeah so i think um i think that might have something about it oh and also i i just think a lot of kids you know they just they're 

360.37 364.06 A: you know they're either they're more concerned with other things like i don't know 

363.98 375.67 A: being slim and shopping or they've got a lot of the kids in her class have second jobs or or first jobs and they're working more than fifteen hours a week which means they come 

374.36 375.72 B: in high school 

375.50 383.88 A: in high school which means they're coming to class and they're tired or they come in the class and they haven't been able to do their homework because they've got these other jobs 

384.36 387.46 A: but i don't know it it's very interesting 

386.04 386.96 B: hm 

387.69 391.59 B: well they ah the other part of this question is 

391.62 394.49 B: what you can do to 

394.57 396.14 B: solve our problem 

396.19 398.34 B: now here in the u._s. you know 

396.30 397.20 A: yeah 

398.52 402.32 B: the only thing i can say is is to give 

403.08 404.84 B: give the teachers 

405.24 406.64 B: the um 

407.82 409.10 B: give 'em back 

409.14 410.57 B: [sigh] the power 

410.72 411.79 A: mhm 

410.89 416.23 B: because you know i don't see them having power you know give the school back the power 

413.98 414.87 A: (( no )) 

416.22 421.77 B: um you know and let adult and the parents back to back the teachers you know 

416.48 417.37 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

421.76 431.37 B: because i think there's more teacher versus parent than there is you know if you could get the parent and teacher and parent school to unite 

431.29 433.13 A: yeah yeah 

432.30 433.16 B: [sigh] 

433.36 441.08 A: well i wish up i think up here i wish my my teach- my friends were saying that she wishes that there were more options because now 

433.40 434.02 B: (( [mn] )) 

441.26 450.12 A: every every parent in every school is telling the kids you have to go to university you have to go to university you have to get really good marks because you have to go to university 

450.07 462.60 A: and what we're having now is the problem where the universities th- there just aren't a enough places at university so i know when i went to university i got in with some pretty ach marks but um 

456.83 457.97 B: oh really 

462.85 470.90 A: now to get into a university i mean you have to get at least at least eighty five percent as a high school which you know is not 

471.14 472.19 A: too 

472.41 486.65 A: ha- you know it it's not too hard but at the same time i mean like every single person coming into university has to have at least an eighty five that is a little bit f- yeah yeah so i feel sorry for these kids they're under such pressure 

481.40 482.42 B: wow 

483.16 484.80 B: wow um 

484.85 490.18 B: and how much is a univer- how much does it cost for a four year education in canada
