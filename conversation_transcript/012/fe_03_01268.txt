369.54 370.68 A: that could be part of it 

371.33 372.31 B: it probably is 

372.45 373.14 A: yeah 

373.01 375.39 B: in the big in the big firms there's i think three 

375.62 377.40 B: four big firms 

377.60 378.18 B: uh and 

378.30 381.05 B: no i wanted something i could do for a long time so 

381.32 381.65 A: well that 

381.72 383.21 B: you know and there's a good market 

381.77 383.07 A: good it's a a good field 

384.14 386.13 A: a very good field especially around tax 

386.92 387.66 B: yeah 

387.76 389.86 B: yeah well i never got into tax too much but 

390.15 391.57 B: mostly just financial 

392.09 392.53 B: analyst 

393.01 393.62 B: kind of thing 

393.31 393.76 A: mhm 

393.93 394.35 A: mhm 

394.68 395.52 B: that was interesting 

395.66 396.73 A: oh okay 

396.21 399.23 B: so no computer games huh other than solitaire 

399.05 399.51 A: i played 

399.62 404.10 A: spider solitaire and i haven't tackled it yet it's on windows two thousand 

404.53 405.22 B: oh 

405.47 405.81 A: and it 

405.59 406.77 B: i wonder i have to look for 

406.14 407.16 A: spider sol- it it's 

407.28 411.73 A: spider solitaire and it's and the most difficult one you use four decks and i haven't won yet 

411.86 412.53 B: oh okay 

412.59 414.90 A: so once in a while just want to see if i can win and i'll just 

414.74 418.05 B: well maybe i'll look for that it's just under programs accessories or 

415.03 415.42 A: play one 

417.52 419.36 A: yeah programs accessories 

419.79 420.37 A: and it's 

420.61 420.89 A: called 

420.99 422.64 A: spider there's regular solitaire and s- 

422.74 423.84 A: spider solitaire 

424.01 424.85 B: i'll try it 

424.81 429.61 A: and spider solitaire is a little different because you have to match the easiest one i think you match is 

429.84 430.59 A: decks you have one or 

431.63 432.54 A: and you just match the 

432.67 432.99 A: three 

433.45 434.01 A: and then it 

434.29 436.06 A: the the medium version i think is 

436.19 436.69 A: two decks 

437.02 438.02 A: so i guess the basic 

437.08 437.57 B: mhm 

438.16 439.04 A: version is one deck 

439.75 442.18 A: medium version is two decks and then the most difficult is 

441.99 442.82 B: is the four 

442.28 442.73 A: four deck 

443.33 445.36 A: and i have not been able to tackle the four 

445.54 446.61 B: well i might try that 

446.79 448.41 B: since i can't get on the internet anymore 

449.04 456.86 B: i don't know the road runner people came and they gave me a new modem and a new cable and then the dell people we called them and they said no it's the road runner people 

449.22 449.66 A: (( )) 

457.38 460.05 A: i there are a lot of people here who've had trouble with road runner too 

459.93 462.41 B: hm we've had it for six months but it just 

462.70 464.85 B: that storm yesterday it blew it out 

465.04 465.96 A: oh okay 

466.11 470.05 B: so i can't even get my email out i can go to u._s._f. and get it though from their computers 

469.20 469.78 A: okay that's 

469.89 470.16 A: good 

470.23 471.09 B: i guess 

471.09 471.59 A: it's a 

471.21 472.37 B: i hope so 

471.84 472.97 A: i'm still in the primitive 

473.08 474.46 A: stage i still have dial up 

474.64 475.89 B: oh no 

475.72 476.35 A: i know 

476.76 480.45 B: we switched over when i joined the program in the fall because i needed something faster 

480.74 481.20 A: uh-huh 

481.79 483.31 B: so you should go to road runner 

483.81 489.33 A: one of these days it's just i'm not on that much and when i'm on i mostly check email which goes fast enough 

489.47 491.34 B: and you could check it at work too probably 

490.80 492.80 A: yeah i don't do that much wor- ah i 

493.00 494.11 A: i don't do that much web 

494.24 497.14 A: surfing really once in a while if i'm doing something 

495.45 496.01 B: yeah 

496.12 498.52 B: god i do a lot of shopping on the internet 

498.67 499.32 A: do you really 

499.34 500.86 B: yeah it's easier uh 

501.04 501.84 B: faster 

501.04 501.93 A: oh what kind of things 

502.09 502.59 A: do you shop 

502.55 505.13 B: well all the kids the hockey gear 

504.87 508.87 A: oh okay that'll that'll be good that's easier than running around to a million stores 

506.82 507.11 B: okay 

508.25 511.69 B: yeah and gifts and things that i want to send to relatives 

512.13 513.60 B: that live out of the state 

513.97 514.46 A: mhm 

514.51 517.19 B: so you can just put their address on it and it goes there 

517.67 518.66 A: that's much easier 

518.41 520.82 B: and then you can just pay for it right on the on line and it's 

520.79 522.91 A: so you're not from florida either where are you from 

521.06 522.12 B: (( )) 

522.88 523.61 B: um
