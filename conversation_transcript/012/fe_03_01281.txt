17.34 19.39 A: so what are they doing they're just asking us where we get our news from 

19.67 20.56 B: i guess so 

21.06 25.99 A: i get most of mine from the newspaper and then i follow up through the day on the internet i manage a golf course 

26.55 27.42 A: so i have uh 

27.79 29.30 A: quite a bit of time to check on it 

29.65 30.16 B: okay 

30.71 31.83 B: um i just watch 

31.96 33.25 B: television and 

33.79 38.17 B: um we don't get the daily newspaper so i don't i don't do it through then there 

39.05 39.46 B: just 

39.70 41.05 B: t._v. keeps me up to date 

42.07 44.09 A: that's kind of a 

44.24 47.80 A: eh i i quit watching t._v. news about ten years ago 

47.52 48.19 B: did you 

48.32 50.90 A: yeah i'm a veteran of the first war so 

50.78 51.32 B: okay 

51.56 53.42 A: i know how skewered they can be 

53.49 53.95 B: right 

54.76 58.53 A: i tend to what i what i do is uh there's uh a website called google dot com 

58.54 58.94 B: uh huh 

59.17 61.79 A: they have a beta site on it google news 

61.61 61.98 B: mhm 

62.04 64.68 A: and what it does is collect newspapers from around the world 

65.36 66.03 B: oh cool 

65.61 66.26 A: and uh 

66.40 71.53 A: it it gives you a pretty unbiased opinion about what's going on and you get a lot of news that they won't show in the u._s. 

71.84 72.49 B: oh neat 

73.42 74.22 A: so uh 

74.46 79.22 A: you wind up reading you know the french daily news then pravda and then u._s._a. today 

79.44 81.22 A: and uh the washington post 

81.33 84.41 A: they collect all the stories from all those and put it into one little newspaper 

84.91 85.60 B: oh that's cool 

87.17 87.72 B: well my 

87.28 88.15 A: but uh 

89.47 90.33 A: i'm sorry go ahead 

90.09 96.18 B: no i was just going i my husband actually he keeps me up to date a lot on most stuff i'm not i'm just not very good at 

96.44 100.33 B: i we just have the t._v. on and so if i hear anything it's just through the t._v. so i'm just 

100.93 103.84 B: i'm not very good at keeping up on current events myself 

104.15 108.14 A: i do the same with my wife she never has time to do anything so 

105.72 106.38 B: uh huh 

108.82 111.10 A: i tend to let her know what's going on 

111.17 113.63 B: yeah my husband's good at doing that because he 

115.00 116.70 B: is good at figuring out what's 

117.44 118.21 B: going on and 

119.17 120.34 B: keep me up to date but 

120.78 122.79 B: we use the internet so that that way that you just 

123.77 124.84 B: (( )) seems cool 

124.95 126.00 B: that would be a neat idea 

134.50 135.74 A: it's pretty middle of the road 

137.96 143.19 A: i can't understand how they expect us to to talk for ten minutes about where we get our news 

141.21 142.48 B: yeah i know 

142.84 146.35 B: i don't know what's going to happen when it's over because like i said i've never done one of these before 

146.65 152.59 A: my wife signed me up i was on my way home i i have a commute so i'm either listening to the radio or 

152.76 153.56 B: well that's good 

153.69 154.69 A: (( )) 

154.07 154.54 B: well what

178.99 181.63 B: they've called right up the nose at five every night 

182.68 185.13 A: you know what i suspect they're doing is they just kind of create a 

185.24 187.40 A: a topic and they're trying to see how we interact 

187.54 187.93 B: yeah 

188.26 191.48 A: it's (( play )) a psych stu- not a civic study

342.89 344.81 B: no we're we're south

347.90 348.35 B: so 

348.00 348.51 A: okay 

348.89 350.92 A: the bulk of our weather is affected by the gulf 

351.18 351.65 B: okay 

353.59 354.13 A: but uh 

355.94 357.16 A: is your phone cutting out too

361.21 361.95 A: oh okay 

361.22 363.70 B: i'm just ignoring that i don't hear it cutting out 

365.18 365.64 A: right 

365.83 369.21 A: i'm trying to think of where else i get my news from i listen to a lot of talk radio 

369.43 369.92 B: mhm 

369.68 379.19 A: you know i i haven't bought a c._d. since ninety four i haven't liked any music since then so i don't even listen to the radio except for the a._m. stations 

379.26 379.60 B: right 

380.49 380.95 A: um 

382.39 384.75 A: i watch t._v. occasionally 

385.52 386.42 A: but uh uh 

387.29 393.68 A: it it's so funny i i spent almost a decade in the marine corps and and watching what's going on right now and watching the reporters 

394.08 394.99 A: you you just 

395.17 398.26 A: can't help but laugh because they're so biased 

398.27 398.57 B: hm 

398.53 399.01 A: and 

399.72 400.33 A: they're they're not 

401.10 404.30 A: doing objective reporting even when they're out in the field with the troops 

404.54 404.93 B: wow 

404.68 406.79 A: they tend to focus more on the negative 

407.25 413.14 A: and there's so much they could focus on like the camaraderie of the guys out there and how everybody's counting on each other and 

413.31 414.02 A: how um 

421.65 427.72 A: and it really becomes a family but they they tend not to focus on that right now it seems that the media is so concerned that 

428.07 433.06 A: they they've set goals for president bush and if he doesn't even make one of those goals the war is a failure 

439.84 446.07 A: they expect us to find all the biological and chemical weapons he has they expect us to to capture or kill saddam 

446.53 449.77 A: they expect us to to do all this without any casualties and 

450.40 450.99 A: i just 

451.47 457.17 A: it it just sickens me that they've already decided how they're going to report this before they've even reported it 

457.43 457.80 B: right 

459.51 459.83 B: hm 

459.51 461.64 A: and uh and no offense but uh 

461.89 462.58 A: three 

463.51 464.95 A: of the top news anchors 

465.35 466.50 A: are all from canada 

468.41 469.86 B: well i never thought of that 

470.08 474.05 A: it it's kind of funny that most of them most of the united states get their news 

474.24 475.06 A: from three canadians 

478.14 478.77 A: and uh 

479.67 488.09 A: yeah i mean no offense to your homeland i can't understand how after two centuries of perfect cooperation your your country decided not to back ours on this 

488.21 489.57 B: yeah i don't know my i was talking with 

489.88 495.81 B: again i don't hear any canadian news here because in the united states you hear nothing about canada there's a huge country up there 

495.98 497.04 A: well isn't quebec 

496.07 498.65 B: but nobody knows anything about canada 

498.47 500.84 A: isn't quebec up for another vote 

498.85 499.32 B: so 

501.36 502.68 A: for separation 

502.52 507.28 B: oh could be see again i don't even know unless my parents keep me up and i again because i do not 

507.46 508.49 B: i do not watch 

508.88 510.61 A: i think there's a referendum for quebec 

508.89 509.51 B: i do not 

513.39 513.78 A: you know 

514.16 519.13 A: voice their siding with the united states they'd uh probably anger a lot of their own french canadian citizens 

519.33 520.00 B: oh yeah
