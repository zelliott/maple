262.92 263.88 A: yeah 

266.50 273.87 B: and use 'em to do something with that i know so the i guess that's why they want people from all over the country so that 

268.72 269.76 A: oh oh gosh 

272.88 274.46 A: right i suppose 

273.96 277.27 B: you know they can kinda get all accents and everything 

277.20 278.07 A: huh 

277.98 280.92 B: 'cause i know we have two very different accents so

282.04 282.96 A: yeah 

283.24 284.92 A: yeah [laughter] 

284.01 287.14 B: maybe that's why you didn't get anybody uh before

523.87 526.38 B: (( yeah i [laughter] i don't know i mean )) 

524.86 530.12 A: subject instead of talking about our personal lives i suppose they're not going to probably call us back [laughter] 

528.05 538.37 B: i'd say i'd well i'd say a lot of 'em get like that 'cause i read on that that uh that they didn't really know what to talk about on the subject i mean they said to talk about how you get your information 

535.27 536.17 A: (( well )) 

538.05 539.44 A: well yeah 

538.60 542.44 B: (( i get it off a t._v. you know [laughter] sometimes the computer )) 

540.74 544.01 A: well they should have it more multiple choice stuff like okay do 

542.94 543.91 B: yeah 

544.33 548.54 B: and so you know talk about this for two minutes talk about that for two minutes something like

561.02 562.52 A: (( [noise] oh yeah [noise] )) 

561.79 569.57 B: they did it on um i think they've done the current events one several times because i heard a couple of people talk about that that they didn't know what to talk about so 

568.62 569.69 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

570.52 577.57 B: i mean they could start arguments like that too [laughter] you might get somebody that has really strong feelings one way or the other 

572.79 575.14 A: [laughter] 

577.12 578.20 A: yeah 

578.76 581.06 B: so they might wanna rethink that one [laughter] [sigh] [noise]

581.70 583.09 A: (( [noise] no kidding )) 

585.68 586.41 A: huh
