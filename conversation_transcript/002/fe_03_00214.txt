103.92 105.14 A: (( yup yup )) 

104.74 111.72 B: well to be a lifetime partner do you have to take a vow the vow of marriage and declare 

111.60 112.69 A: (( no )) 

112.70 113.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

112.76 114.94 B: i am your partner for life 

114.60 116.04 A: (( no [noise] )) 

115.70 118.01 B: you don't think so that 

116.73 120.38 A: no i think i think it's just a matter of um 

120.59 125.63 A: i don't even think the commitment has to be spoken i think two people can tell if that commitment's there 

125.93 134.65 B: [mn] well yeah i i would say you have to in order to say you're a lifetime partner you have to actually declare it 

134.23 135.87 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

135.86 141.63 B: that's why i say i've had two of course i have children also they're lifetime partners aren't they 

142.35 148.81 A: i never consider children to be a lifetime partner in fact i consider children more like um 

149.64 154.10 A: something on loan to us until we y- you know give them the 

154.47 158.08 A: um essentials they need to be off on their own 

158.10 160.22 A: and then they're off on their own 

159.68 163.09 B: yes well that's that's true isn't it yeah 

163.32 166.22 B: so what about um if you say 

166.23 170.89 B: that um that people could be gay and married 

171.38 177.28 B: then how open could it be to be if you were gonna say you had to be official 

177.16 179.21 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] 

177.98 180.24 B: what do you think about gay marriage 

180.60 184.73 A: i think that that's the same thing as a lifetime commitment a lifetime partner 

184.70 186.52 B: yeah i think so too 

186.28 190.95 A: and i don't understand why so many people are so threatened by it other than 

191.22 194.02 A: that usually gets into a religious arena 

193.93 195.30 B: right right 

194.92 199.84 A: and even and even then it's like if one proclaims to be a christian 

200.21 204.44 A: you know jesus never married and jesus went around with a bunch of guys 

202.49 203.24 B: right 

204.22 206.99 B: [laughter] 

205.84 207.82 A: [laughter] 

207.00 212.11 B: god knows what happened in that olive grove [laughter] 

209.41 210.80 A: (( that's right )) 

211.21 217.56 A: [laughter] well and we all you know we know just from history that um 

217.58 224.24 A: bisexuality was much more accepted like in the times of the greeks you know so 

222.41 223.35 B: right 

224.61 231.60 A: well yeah i i you know i think a lot i think gay couples can have lifelong commitments also i i don't think there's any reason not to 

231.11 234.29 B: i think it's kind of a privacy issue do what you wanna do 

234.73 238.24 B: but what about then polygamy or um 

239.24 240.64 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

241.05 244.95 B: like jerry lee lewis married somebody who was thirteen years old is 

245.28 246.72 A: who was married what 

245.87 248.31 B: that okay jerry lee lewis 

249.30 250.66 B: the rock music 

250.00 253.40 A: oh yeah married his uh thirteen year old cousin 

251.93 255.84 B: married his cousin who was like thirteen years old is that okay 

255.86 270.65 A: well you know again it's just a societ- soc- societal norms change there was a time when it it was not considered ou- out of the ordinary to be married at that age and i think it was you know probably during the growth of our country when people were moving westward 

264.57 265.44 B: right 

271.08 273.05 A: i don't think they waited till they were you know 

273.31 280.48 A: definitely didn't wait till they were like twenty five they're getting married they weren't even finishing high school and they were getting married most people only had an eighth grade education if that 

280.40 282.09 B: (( yeah and women )) 

280.92 294.65 A: so i again i think it's kind of a societal thing and the and the times and you know who knows biblically speaking when they say certain people lived to be hundreds of years old you know we don't we aren't sure if they're talking about the same kind of year as we're talking about and 

294.92 300.57 A: you know because we aren't living that long so how could these people have lived that long so maybe the whole concept of time was different 

300.84 305.01 A: and and you know and maturation [noise] this is um 

300.98 301.79 B: um 

305.16 310.03 A: i'm i only have two sons and they're both grown and on their own 

310.07 317.05 A: but my friends have told me that their daughters started menstruating like in fourth grade 

317.00 317.95 B: wow 

317.71 328.01 A: and you know they're only like eleven years old at that point so biologically or physically one is ready to be married at that age you know 

327.53 328.68 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

328.10 332.33 A: e- especially for those people who contend that the point of marriage is procreation 

332.32 333.55 B: yeah right 

333.23 336.10 A: yeah but what what makes it what 

335.32 337.02 B: like that though [laughter] 

336.35 340.47 A: what are the qualities for a lifelong commitment or a lifelong partner 

340.61 346.39 A: how does how you know now you said you've had two and were were they ended um 

346.80 351.64 B: they were both well to make a long story short they were both mentally ill 

351.31 352.29 A: uh-huh 

352.28 353.78 B: (( unable to function )) 

352.36 354.14 A: i had one that was mentally ill 

354.38 355.22 B: yeah 

355.18 361.90 A: so so you kinda had to end it rather than letting nature end it right right 

355.47 356.46 B: (( what kind of )) 

359.41 361.55 B: uh yes absolutely 

361.76 365.00 B: because they were a danger to me and the children 

363.69 366.00 A: uh-huh uh-huh right 

366.21 371.72 A: and so when you obviously when we go into these relationships we think they're gonna be lifelong 

366.26 367.10 B: uh 

371.92 378.53 B: you know i was talking with a guy the other day who said a scary thing to me he said you know men get their meaning 

378.57 380.84 B: through their relationships with women 

381.48 385.72 B: and i thought oh my god what a tremendous burden to put on a woman 

385.63 387.59 A: men get their meaning 

387.43 389.67 B: that's right so 

388.99 392.13 A: see i would think most men get their meaning from their jobs 

391.97 393.36 B: yeah well 

393.63 401.83 B: this is what this is what he said 'cause he has a good job but he's feeling very sad 'cause he broke up with somebody feeling like he has no no meaning in his life 

401.20 402.51 A: right right 

402.70 403.87 A: well 

404.55 411.50 B: uh well what and so what you were asking what is the what are the qualities in a lifelong partner well [mn] 

408.94 410.27 A: right 

411.69 417.36 B: when i heard that i thought well that's certainly not a quality a person has to find their meaning within their own self 

416.69 425.29 A: exactly exactly and that was one of the problems with the uh relationship i had where the person was a little mentally out of it because 

418.85 419.87 B: (( that's so )) 

425.16 433.71 A: i mean he literally told me i was his life and that at the beginning it was like oh isn't this flattering until i realized he really meant it a hundred percent [laughter] 

433.04 435.35 B: how can i uh get away from him um 

435.42 445.31 B: but so if you if you take away that uh meaning then you get to having somebody and right now i think i would just like somebody to kind of be there 

445.00 446.24 A: mhm 

446.37 455.91 A: i think that's what it usually does boil down to that you want somebody who you who you know you can count on through thick and thin you know you want somebody who can be there for the ordinary times 

451.98 453.18 B: that's right 

455.85 457.65 B: who you can have fun with too 

457.06 458.61 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

458.35 463.83 B: where when he's there he's at least interesting [laughter] 

462.43 465.64 A: yeah yeah that's right that's awfully right 

465.94 467.23 A: and um 

467.56 479.40 A: and that you know then it becomes difficult because you know that sounds like the definition or the description of a friend and yet most of us want more than just a friend in our lifelong commitment we want someone you know who where there's some kind of 

476.69 477.54 B: (( right )) 

479.31 482.81 A: you know we want some kind of physical sexual at- attraction also 

482.78 486.95 B: but that kinda takes care of itself if you get along really well 

486.52 487.51 A: you think so 

487.94 490.38 B: yeah i think i think um 

490.39 494.80 B: i think uh seduction beg- is is like a twenty four hour thing 

494.34 495.63 A: exactly 

495.44 498.57 B: uh i mean guys sometimes they'll call you up in the morning 

499.83 506.93 B: then when you see them in the evening and you're all okay yeah i'll look forward to seeing you tonight and then you see them tonight 

506.92 516.22 B: and they're in a bad mood or they wanna watch football or something like that then the next time they call you at ten o'clock in the morning and say gee i'd love to see you you go oh screw that [laughter] 

515.49 526.37 A: [laughter] yeah well well that you're right because then if you're if you're already with someone you're with them all day or a good portion of the day so it's not just that um 

524.03 525.20 B: yeah right 

526.43 530.82 A: calling up and thinking they wanna be with you and then when they see you yeah it could be a different story right 

530.47 538.61 B: well you you were talking about dependability perseverance being there st- you know not changing all the time 

537.94 539.59 A: right 

538.96 540.50 B: making a real 

540.56 542.02 B: commitment to it 

541.47 545.33 A: right and and and and just enjoying each other's company 

545.11 546.07 B: right 

545.81 553.31 A: you know and it doesn't have to be anything extravagant that's why i said the ordinary times are also you know just really important 

552.84 553.77 B: yeah 

553.62 554.80 A: and uh 

555.45 558.94 A: and i and i guess there must be people out there who are like that 

559.60 561.42 B: i i hear 

560.89 562.86 A: [noise] right and um 

562.51 571.76 B: then you meet some of these people who supposedly have these fabulous relationships and you get to know them a little better and yeah it's not really all it was cracked up to be [laughter] 

570.07 579.96 A: right but then i look at i look at older generation often and i think you know i think a lot of those people like let's take my grandparents' generation skip a generation you know 

579.93 580.70 B: (( mhm yes )) 

580.04 584.40 A: and they seem to i know my grandparents married rel- relatively young 

584.74 593.10 A: [lipsmack] and they stayed together you know like fifty years and i'm thinking to myself did they love each other or again was it almost like 

593.23 600.31 A: um you just stick together because that's expected of you at the time that's again your societal norm in which you're living 

599.95 607.20 B: i don't i think they just didn't ever it just didn't ever occur to them to do anything else i they wouldn't have dreamt of getting divorced 

606.59 611.71 A: right and even if they weren't happy or fulfilled or satisfied they just stayed together 

611.62 612.72 B: yeah 

611.76 614.63 A: is that a lifelong commitment is that a lifelong partner 

614.45 622.80 B: well i admire long term marriages that have somehow managed to stick together i i really they give me satisfaction just seeing them 

622.33 624.16 A: mhm mhm i agree 

624.22 630.51 B: [laughter] my brother my brother and his wife have been married almost well like for forty thirty five years something like 

629.84 630.84 A: wow 

630.97 633.89 B: and i know what they've been through to get there you know 

633.26 636.24 A: exactly in other words you know it wasn't all smooth sailing 

635.86 639.01 B: that's right i i really admire that 

636.58 638.06 A: right right 

638.48 640.32 A: exactly i do too 

639.38 642.50 B: they both can be a real pain in the ass 

642.25 643.28 A: what can 

643.41 644.66 B: they both 

644.10 647.62 A: (( yeah yeah yeah [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

647.91 650.97 B: yeah well we solved this problem didn't we 

650.48 659.41 A: [laughter] well we know what it we know what it takes we just have to find the person you know [laughter] who has actually i think i have found that person again so i'm very fortunate 

659.58 661.55 B: i have a candidate 

661.15 662.35 A: oh good 

661.99 670.59 B: but a- actually i've been completely on my own for ten years 'cause this was just too much trouble i felt like too much it was too expensive to me 

670.41 671.39 A: (( ah )) 

670.76 683.48 B: trying to find a life part- uh expensive emotionally mentally time wise energy wise i would just rather be on my own eat what i want nobody's saying what you're having oatmeal for dinner 

673.40 674.32 A: uh-huh 

682.87 684.40 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

683.84 689.99 B: or anything like i just couldn't have stood it i would've just screamed and thrown the damn bowl of oatmeal at him 

687.29 688.34 A: yeah 

689.50 691.70 A: [laughter] 

690.84 694.62 B: but now now i'm thinking well you know maybe it'd be nice 

694.50 703.41 A: well that's the whole thing we all have to be ready and and then you have to you know run into the right person at the right time i have a friend who's been on her own for over ten years 

700.71 703.58 B: don't you don't you think no matter how old 

703.78 709.25 B: don't you think no matter how old you are you repeat the same patterns [laughter] you repeated when you were a teenager 

708.24 712.17 A: you know that's interesting because when i was in a in a rather 

712.36 719.95 A: down feeling period between relationships i thought to myself now why can't i just go out there and make a relationship hap-
