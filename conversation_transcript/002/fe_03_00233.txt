125.16 126.06 B: anything like that 

127.57 130.14 A: so you kind of it's a mutual agreement between the both of you 

130.16 131.26 B: yeah it it has to be 

131.77 132.09 A: yeah 

133.69 134.04 B: broke 

134.53 134.95 A: yeah 

135.62 136.05 B: um 

136.37 139.06 A: it is is there any particular reason oh well 

139.62 140.46 A: why you might just 

141.94 142.70 A: since you want to 

143.14 144.38 A: date other people and 

144.72 145.98 A: you both agree on that 

146.43 146.85 A: is it 

146.94 149.77 A: just certain convenient things that keep you together 

150.37 154.00 B: um well you know actually we like each other we've been together for six years 

152.81 153.17 A: yeah 

154.38 155.47 A: yeah that's a long time 

155.49 155.80 B: mhm 

156.58 157.04 B: um 

158.62 161.26 B: there are aspects of one another's lives that we don't do 

162.44 162.84 A: mhm 

166.57 167.52 B: term that we both are 

167.99 169.72 B: pretty certain neither of us can be 

170.24 171.39 B: all things to everyone 

172.25 174.52 B: and i don't know if anybody can be everything 

177.15 177.56 A: yeah 

177.58 178.19 B: you know every 

178.62 179.76 B: every tease of your life 

180.58 183.50 B: and so it's useful to have people who you're close to 

185.78 186.09 B: yo- 

186.24 186.67 B: friends 

187.18 187.53 A: right 

188.34 189.15 B: and plus we both 

190.25 190.70 B: crushes on 

192.30 192.92 A: oh really 

193.13 193.85 B: yeah oh yeah 

194.91 195.41 A: wow 

195.59 198.28 B: and so it seems easier to not have to feel 

198.73 199.60 B: guilty about it 

199.59 199.94 A: yeah 

201.58 202.95 A: so you're very open about it 

203.39 203.69 B: yeah 

204.45 207.00 A: so you can actually say like okay tonight i'm going out 

207.26 207.76 A: with someone else 

208.19 208.56 B: yeah 

208.20 208.89 A: and that's okay 

209.37 211.26 B: yeah but we also have the ability to 

211.68 213.05 B: date them i think that person 

214.02 215.71 B: not somebody who i want in my life 

216.22 216.67 A: mhm 

217.48 217.90 B: about 

217.99 218.41 B: somebody 

218.71 219.46 B: that somebody else 

220.62 221.71 B: my wife for example is 

222.64 225.54 B: attempting to date and it's not like you know random sleeping around 

225.69 225.99 A: yeah 

227.15 227.82 B: more uh 

229.08 229.81 A: more of a relationsh- 

230.27 230.66 B: yeah 

230.76 231.04 A: yeah 

232.99 234.01 B: i think that this person 

234.89 236.61 B: worthy of pursuing a relationship with 

238.76 240.07 B: well i'd like to meet them then 

242.56 243.39 B: and then we meet them 

243.58 244.76 B: and we talk and determine 

245.11 245.87 B: you know if they're 

247.01 247.82 B: broken or 

249.56 251.33 A: wow this is really interesting 

251.95 254.39 A: so how does the other party feel about that 

255.09 255.59 B: um 

255.45 257.55 A: do they feel like they're being tested you think 

257.86 258.29 B: um 

258.63 261.33 B: well personally i feel like i'm being tested right now 

261.10 261.84 A: oh really 

261.42 263.02 B: um because 

265.21 266.96 B: talking to a friend of mine well 

267.12 268.47 B: somebody who became a friend of mine 

271.47 272.50 B: relationship and i think 

277.96 278.73 B: i'm somebody 

279.83 280.21 B: he wants 

280.53 280.97 B: my life 

281.27 282.38 A: oh 

286.32 287.62 A: this is really interesting 

289.00 290.89 B: yeah it's not for everyone and it's not 

292.50 293.29 B: jealousy 

294.88 295.63 B: jealousy is 

296.04 296.59 B: (( )) 

296.70 296.98 B: fact 

301.78 302.58 B: it requires a lot of 

311.49 316.58 B: this other this thing that person did made me jealous and then figure out what it was and fix it 

318.14 318.76 A: wow 

318.94 321.10 A: well it is very communicative in that sense 

321.42 324.42 B: yeah and i don't think there are many people i would do this 

324.98 325.35 A: yeah 

331.67 332.93 A: do you feel that maybe 

333.39 338.99 A: i'm sorry i'm asking you all the question but i (( )) i'm really interested by this do you feel that 

339.57 342.40 A: do you feel maybe scared even in a sense that she 

342.58 345.20 A: may find someone okay obviously you 

345.32 351.52 A: both are together and you have a relationship you have certain und- un- understandings and i'm sure you have communication and all that 

351.73 353.08 A: and whatever 

353.32 354.47 A: aspect of 

354.95 356.14 A: of you that 

356.86 359.81 A: fulfilling to her or um 

361.69 364.85 A: how do i i don't know how to explain it whatever 

365.34 367.80 A: character or personality whatever it is that you have 

368.17 368.53 A: that 

369.70 371.49 A: you know en- enamored by and 

372.35 381.18 A: has chosen you to be in her life from the beginning and all that do you ever feel that someone else may come into her life and may fulfill that very part and suddenly you may not be 

381.82 385.80 A: useful anymore i know that sounds bad useful but you know what i mean that was a bad choice of words 

384.90 386.08 B: no i know what you mean though yeah 

386.54 387.16 B: um 

386.92 388.98 A: is that a do you ever feel like that's a risk or 

390.21 390.63 B: i don't know 

390.84 392.34 B: i think that would be a risk anyway 

392.54 392.86 A: yeah 

396.57 398.05 B: and you know i guess we'll 

398.68 399.87 B: deal with that when it happens 

400.10 400.45 A: right 

400.48 400.94 B: however 

401.13 402.90 B: if that were going to happen it would happen anyway 

405.14 405.83 A: that's true 

410.62 412.89 B: at the very least at this point she can say look i'm going to go 

413.00 414.28 B: spend the weekend with this guy 

416.86 418.02 B: i don't know at that point 

425.25 426.20 A: it do you feel 

426.34 431.18 A: comforta- like if she says okay i'm going to go away for the weekend with a friend maybe you've already met this person and 

431.56 432.34 A: you think yeah 

432.51 433.44 A: he's a cool guy and 

434.08 434.75 A: you approve 

435.43 435.98 A: um 

436.62 439.19 A: what if you're not doing anything particular that weekend 

439.41 441.49 A: do you kind of feel like you sit around and dwell 

442.42 442.89 B: um 

444.15 446.11 B: usually i try to do things um 

446.90 448.49 B: well the one or two times that's happened 

449.13 450.24 B: i've tried to do stuff 

451.33 453.62 B: you know make sure that i have something to do so i don't sit around 

454.95 456.66 B: so i don't sit around and dwell and brood 

457.52 458.04 B: um 

461.55 463.85 B: boyfriend invited her up to a wedding 

464.64 465.33 B: friends in maine 

466.49 469.52 B: and she said look i'd like to go away this weekend so i went and i visited 

470.58 471.38 B: you know not a 

471.79 473.79 B: girlfriend but just a friend in uh 

479.11 481.99 B: and then she came back with stories and i came back with stories and we said oh 

482.33 483.09 B: had a great old time 

488.13 489.27 B: you know i'm not going to leave her 

470.58 471.38 B: you know not a 

471.79 473.79 B: girlfriend but just a friend in uh 

479.11 481.99 B: and then she came back with stories and i came back with stories and we said oh 

482.33 483.09 B: had a great old time 

488.13 489.27 B: you know i'm not going to leave her 

489.82 490.13 A: right 

496.23 496.57 A: yeah 

498.22 503.75 A: (( )) you're leaving that possibility open in the event that someone did come along and you may feel 

504.62 506.56 A: it'd be worth your while whatever to leave her 

507.43 507.79 B: no 

508.30 508.75 A: oh you're not 

508.79 509.12 B: well 

512.23 514.87 B: i don't know see that's the weird thing i think the idea is that 

527.71 528.09 B: both 

531.04 532.50 B: this is the lifetime thing 

536.12 536.53 A: right 

536.67 538.20 A: and like you said at the beginning 

538.44 541.50 A: um you can't find everything that you want in one person 

541.52 541.80 B: yeah 

542.13 547.77 A: and that's very difficult to find and maybe the other people that are coming into your lives are fulfilling certain 

548.61 549.34 A: areas that 

550.04 551.90 A: you're interested in having fulfilled 

552.00 552.32 B: yeah 

552.59 553.02 A: yeah 

553.56 556.38 A: it's funny i don't know if you ever watch this show sex in the city 

556.55 557.28 A: did you ever see that 

558.13 559.03 B: don't have t._v.
