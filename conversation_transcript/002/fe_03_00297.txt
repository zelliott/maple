58.20 58.74 B: it's more like 

59.55 63.39 B: you know if they did you know had people that were a little more capable of it maybe it 

63.78 64.86 B: would make a difference right 

66.25 66.95 B: i think 

67.04 69.37 A: uh-huh so you think it's it's not um 

67.19 67.49 B: oh 

69.33 71.54 B: i mean right now clearly you know they they have 

71.86 72.73 B: you know these 

73.15 77.99 B: people without high school education still in high school you know this security obviously is not going to help them but like 

77.67 78.19 A: mhm 

78.50 79.50 B: you know maybe it's like 

79.77 84.33 A: well you know i heard something in the news i thought they were going to actually change that 

80.49 81.34 B: a kind of (( )) 

84.60 85.92 A: that they were going to have more 

85.97 86.71 B: yeah but 

86.08 88.12 A: i don't know educated (( )) people 

88.79 89.08 A: it 

88.79 90.90 B: i don't know i'm sceptical about that but 

90.73 91.68 A: you haven't heard about that 

91.91 98.62 B: alright now here's here's a good question i don't know this is straying off topic but what do you think about like racial profiling in regards to ah 

93.70 94.12 A: uh-huh 

99.45 100.16 B: but you know it 

100.29 100.54 B: but 

100.66 101.11 B: it 

101.25 102.51 B: um airport security 

102.95 103.51 B: support it 

104.10 105.16 B: not support it or what 

105.37 108.35 A: well you know i was thinking about that just the other day 

108.59 109.07 A: um 

109.55 111.89 A: hm i mean on the one hand i think it's awful 

112.44 114.17 A: because you know if i looked at like 

113.39 114.09 B: yeah 

114.33 114.90 A: uh 

115.16 116.92 A: muslim or arab or something 

117.06 118.74 A: no he didn't just stop me every time 

119.49 124.6 A: because this how i look and in fact you know i'm from russia and in russia 

124.75 125.80 A: ah in big cities 

126.05 127.82 A: they stop people certain people 

126.19 126.46 B: huh 

128.57 129.89 A: also kind of racial 

130.19 135.26 A: profile thing they stop them on the street and ask for their documents to make sure they have legal documents to be in the country 

135.63 135.96 B: mhm 

136.03 142.59 A: so this is kind of similar to that so i think on the one hand it's awful but on the other hand it is true that um most terrorists do come from 

143.87 144.33 B: right 

144.14 145.25 A: (( )) so 

144.96 146.86 B: i heard some statistics like ah 

147.64 156.80 B: i don't know nine out of ten terrorists are named mohammed or something i think i think that it's i mean my personal opinion is that it's substantiated enough to 

150.77 151.28 A: uh-huh 

157.31 162.14 B: could be okay i mean yeah it is pos- it's it is terrible but like 

162.26 164.18 B: the same time if it's going to prevent you know 

164.55 165.04 A: mhm 

165.11 165.46 B: such 

165.67 168.50 B: awful tragedies and a little injustice eh i don't know 

167.93 172.95 A: yeah and i think so true and i think even if some of those muslims especially if they are americans 

169.03 169.93 B: let's deal with it 

173.29 173.62 B: mhm 

173.73 174.17 A: i mean 

174.43 177.72 A: i don't know i can see if if they would be upset 

178.15 182.96 A: say (( )) why are they picking on me but on the other hand if they are americans maybe they would understand 

178.44 178.77 B: (( )) 

180.97 181.39 B: right 

181.55 182.33 B: you know maybe it's 

183.09 187.30 A: you know why and ah not get all upset about it i would hope so i don't know 

183.22 183.73 B: right 

187.36 188.29 B: i ah 

188.64 190.12 B: i i saw something on um 

190.57 193.04 B: you know that show ah hardball with chris matthews 

193.63 197.82 B: i don't know it's it's a (( )) show on n._b._c. and he's like a pretty funny guy and he said ah 

198.40 199.16 B: one of his like 

199.44 206.87 B: he got in a lot of trouble for this that he said he's look i'm not saying that ah all muslims are terrorists but i am saying that all terrorists are muslims 

206.76 213.40 A: i wouldn't say all terrorists but statistically a lot yeah 

209.29 210.35 B: so i don't know 

210.89 211.27 B: i 

211.79 216.83 B: well i mean well i mean yeah it's true like ninety five percent really are muslims so 

216.70 217.29 A: mhm 

217.68 219.44 B: or arabs or whatever you want to call 

220.06 220.63 A: yeah 

220.14 221.97 B: but ah it'd be funny if i like 

222.09 225.64 B: got connected with someone who was like an arab that would be an interesting conversation 

225.80 226.35 B: don't you think 

227.28 233.14 A: yeah i think so yeah i wonder if they have a way of controlling this not to have someone like that 

231.36 231.67 B: yeah 

233.13 237.38 B: i can't believe see i thought that i would never get called cause i you know don't really i thought they were 

233.53 234.30 A: (( )) 

237.51 242.76 B: looking for people who have more of like an accent but i suppose you know people think i have an accent too so 

243.27 254.58 A: well no i don't that looking for that they're going to laugh when they hear our conversation but they're going to laugh when they hear us talking about them but yeah i just got the idea they want ah anybody 

247.71 248.02 B: what 

248.78 249.45 B: oh 

250.37 250.80 B: yeah 

254.76 255.13 A: yeah 

255.33 255.70 B: huh 

255.54 256.96 A: english speakers and non 

255.93 256.45 B: interesting 

257.55 260.76 A: not you know native english speakers and not i don't know what their point is 

261.69 266.16 B: alright so what they'll be pissed if we don't stay on topic what else can we talk about here 

266.52 268.08 A: well let's see what one 

268.23 270.03 A: well what do you think about those random 

268.37 269.57 B: whether (( )) 

270.19 270.70 A: uh 

271.04 271.99 A: (( )) you know when (( )) 

272.10 273.29 A: dial people randomly 

273.63 275.31 A: what you know i heard something and (( )) 

274.38 275.53 B: oh i'm all for it 

275.67 278.57 A: you're for for it yeah you know it was it was ah um 

278.74 284.09 A: the practice or something that brought this ah up saying that people are willing to give up some of their rights 

284.25 286.08 A: such as you know being searched 

284.50 284.93 B: yes 

285.21 285.61 B: yeah 

286.47 286.87 B: mhm 

286.90 288.03 A: so what do you think about that 

289.16 292.00 B: (( )) see i don't know it's easy for me to say that 

292.28 296.47 B: i'm in support of it because you know i'm just like ah you know white looking guy and 

296.90 298.93 B: i wouldn't be really subject to any like 

299.35 307.41 B: you know i mean granted if it were truly is random then i'd be stopped just as much as other people but i don't it doesn't bother me at all i mean you know i've 

307.97 312.64 B: flown to israel a few times and they they will look through your bags for forty five minutes 

312.39 312.96 A: mhm 

313.09 316.64 B: and you have to be there and they'll ask you about everything and but you know 

316.83 319.26 B: i it's easy for me to say it doesn't bother me because i don't 

319.66 320.22 B: um 

321.09 323.29 B: i don't know i don't have anything suspicious in there or 

323.90 327.60 B: (( )) to let you know whatever i feel like it's for our own best good 

327.37 327.80 A: yeah 

328.08 328.83 B: but 

329.35 333.67 B: i mean did you ever hear that funny story about like the woman who had ah 

333.93 339.18 B: you know the the sex toy or whatever and she got stopped and she was very mortified and all that 

338.38 341.65 A: oh no i didn't know (( )) mhm 

340.49 340.87 B: uh-oh 

341.11 344.49 B: who you know i don't know for me personally it doesn't bother me at all 

345.16 345.87 B: what about you 

346.35 350.62 A: yeah i feel the same way it doesn't bother me at all i mean if if they come to my house unannounced 

350.77 354.78 A: then of course i would be worried but you know we all getting on the plane we all want to be safe 

353.40 353.73 B: yeah 

355.10 360.49 A: so i'm all for it i mean i want them to search everybody if you ask me you know 

355.30 355.85 B: right really 

358.78 362.17 B: see i think i think the ideal solution even though probably it's not 

362.47 363.79 B: financially ah 

364.78 366.52 B: you know possible is to 

365.96 366.37 A: mhm 

366.76 369.35 B: like like i know like it'll all have like thr- 

369.53 370.08 B: you know 

370.19 371.99 B: like five undercover armed 

372.20 376.91 B: people on all the flights and that would be and that's why they have such a great 

372.31 372.71 A: mhm 

377.11 379.12 B: um security record 

379.12 380.12 A: wh- who does 

379.27 379.90 B: but ah 

380.53 382.89 B: (( )) it's like the israeli national airline 

382.35 382.83 A: uh-huh 

382.95 383.77 A: uh-huh 

383.45 386.59 B: like there there hasn't been a successful hijacking of their planes in like 

386.59 387.24 A: uh-huh 

387.03 389.18 B: i don't think ever i don't know but ah 

388.35 390.36 A: so they dress as civilians i'm sorry to interrupt 

390.34 391.71 B: yeah yeah it's just um 

391.17 391.56 A: mhm 

391.74 392.12 A: mhm 

392.14 394.18 B: it's just like yeah undercover people and like 

393.81 394.64 A: yeah yeah mhm 

394.77 396.02 B: i mean just last week they had 

396.23 399.31 B: some guys stand up and was about to h- hijack the plane and i'm like 

399.65 402.66 B: five undercover security guards jumped him and that was the end of it 

402.88 403.47 A: mhm 

403.12 404.30 B: they landed the plane and 

404.40 405.57 B: i think see 

405.83 407.71 B: if the u._s. airlines could afford that 

407.90 408.43 A: mhm 

407.94 409.86 B: that would be something -cause that's really the 

410.50 412.97 B: the true way i mean you'd you'd need like 

413.28 414.85 B: you know these are highly trained people that 

415.18 418.33 B: for a successful hijacking you need like twenty people which really isn't 

417.90 418.40 A: mhm 

418.46 419.87 B: feasible to have on a plane you know 

420.33 424.04 A: well they did talk about that like a year ago saying that they would have some u._s. 

424.14 424.66 A: marshals 

424.96 427.62 A: but i guess not on every plane and not not five 

425.73 426.28 B: yeah 

426.50 430.16 B: right yeah it's like it's like on one out of every twenty planes so 

430.30 434.86 A: well i guess that that you know could be helpful but you can't predict which plane 

433.79 434.27 B: right 

435.40 436.97 A: don't or it might have terrorists on 

436.00 438.73 B: yeah that's why they they really need to do it on all of them but 

438.92 439.54 B: i mean 

439.65 442.10 B: i guess it's just not feasible financially but 

443.11 444.12 B: you know what can you do 

445.80 446.46 B: so 

445.94 446.26 A: so 

446.58 448.19 A: are you flying less now or 

448.57 450.47 A: did it effect you your travel 

449.12 450.55 B: um not really 

450.87 452.63 B: no actually i'm flying ah 

453.26 454.53 B: in a week 

454.73 455.94 B: so 

456.04 456.74 B: but um 

457.28 460.93 B: well i don't know i i feel like if you get scared by these things then they've won and 

461.03 464.81 B: you know so decrease your flying or don't go to places that you normally go 

465.49 467.45 B: that's what they're trying to do incite fear 

467.79 469.34 A: mhm well 

469.55 470.12 A: um 

470.93 473.42 A: i've been flying about the same except 

473.52 473.80 A: i 

474.00 480.77 A: have a baby so i can't fly as much as i used to so if i'm now i'm flying less because of the baby not because i'm afraid 

480.89 486.57 A: but we did go to russia last summer and i could not sleep the whole night the night before i was so worried 

486.91 488.93 A: and i even called my husband yeah 

487.52 487.88 B: really 

489.14 494.49 A: um because i had to meet him in new york he anyways it's a long story so he wasn't at home that night 

494.60 500.28 A: uh tori maybe we should just cancel our trip so i was really worried like the night before 

500.76 501.40 B: huh 

500.82 501.07 A: but 

501.24 502.95 A: but then i was okay yeah 

502.33 504.84 B: wait just random random question but what do you teach here 

505.05 505.87 A: i teach ah

524.99 525.93 A: yeah 

526.29 532.00 B: i don't know it's a tough topic to talk about for so long any topic i suppose with complete strangers is not 

528.11 528.80 A: it is 

532.26 536.20 B: too easy to talk for to you know about for ten minutes 

533.54 533.95 A: right 

535.75 541.27 A: i was hoping to get the topic about plants or something they had one there did you see the topics
