58.34 60.44 A: a hard question for me to answer 

60.99 62.71 A: i guess that uh 

65.31 65.75 B: mhm 

65.94 66.83 A: um 

67.73 68.61 A: i'm rea- i'd need 

68.81 71.30 A: just to have somebody who would be um 

73.75 75.06 A: honest and 

75.71 76.82 A: trustworthy 

77.62 79.65 A: um those are probably two big 

79.81 80.97 A: issues for me 

82.98 84.10 A: um how about yourself 

83.29 83.86 B: that's my 

84.97 90.22 B: um i probably would also be looking for the same issues you talked about honesty and faithfulness 

90.84 98.20 B: there should i mean there shouldn't be uh we should be able to agree on some decisions and also be able to disagree on some decisions 

98.75 101.12 B: i wouldn't want someone who was exactly like me 

103.18 104.04 A: no uh that 

103.55 104.40 B: what about you 

104.86 108.01 A: i couldn't i can totally relate to that i think that 

108.11 111.66 A: being so with somebody who's exactly like yourself would be boring 

112.18 116.68 B: that would be absolutely boring that would be like looking at yourself all the time and 

117.57 118.88 B: that wouldn't be (( )) 

117.93 120.21 A: and you'd never grow you'd never learn anything and 

121.75 122.20 A: um 

122.82 124.05 A: so yeah be ha- ha- 

123.15 123.61 B: yeah that 

124.61 125.12 A: i'm sorry 

125.67 126.90 B: yeah that's that's very true 

128.06 128.74 A: um 

130.72 134.32 B: (( have you reached )) have you reached a stage in your life where you're looking 

130.80 131.39 A: but 

134.46 136.24 B: where you would be looking for a life partner 

137.94 139.20 A: i suppose i mean 

140.61 143.34 A: you never know when a life partner is going to come along i guess 

143.59 144.11 A: um 

145.55 147.77 A: and i'm not at the point 

148.11 149.41 A: where i think it 

149.99 150.88 A: that would be 

151.62 153.18 A: something unacceptable to me 

154.01 156.54 A: um on the other hand i'm not really looking for anybody 

156.98 157.89 A: in particular 

158.46 159.14 B: mhm mhm 

159.04 159.75 A: do you know what i mean 

160.30 160.99 B: yeah i have 

162.66 163.55 A: how about yourself 

164.13 166.04 B: uh no i have 

166.19 170.02 B: probably some more years of uh work to do and 

170.29 175.13 B: right now want i would just be looking for some friends and if this relationship develops into a 

175.27 178.04 B: us being a life partner that would be a great but 

179.26 182.84 B: right now i i'm i wouldn't say that i'm looking for a life partner right now 

183.81 184.48 A: okay 

185.61 186.10 A: um 

186.66 187.70 A: and so 

187.84 190.03 A: when do you feel it's appropriate to 

191.21 192.43 A: find a life partner 

192.87 200.56 B: i i i i don't think there is a such a thing as a proper time for you to find a lif- life partner when someone just walks in you just know that 

201.04 203.42 B: he or she is a person you are supposed to be with 

204.09 205.44 B: what do you think on this issue 

207.19 207.75 A: um 

210.06 212.35 A: yeah i don't think that there's necessarily 

212.63 213.68 A: a set time 

214.07 214.59 A: um 

215.52 216.41 A: for when you should 

217.23 219.27 A: be looking or find your 

220.38 220.86 A: um 

221.09 222.10 A: mate 

222.71 223.23 A: you know 

223.40 223.90 A: um 

224.88 225.57 A: i think it would 

225.99 227.53 A: happen when it's meant to happen 

228.22 230.54 B: yeah that that's that's very true that's very true 

231.90 232.44 A: um 

233.55 235.83 B: have you met someone who you feel 

236.82 239.39 B: could have been your life partner or could be your life partner 

242.56 243.29 A: um 

246.83 248.21 A: yes 

248.66 250.37 B: wow that's good news man 

250.38 252.80 A: um i think so but it's not 

252.91 253.93 A: the case that 

256.45 261.62 A: well at at the time i thought that they could have been my life partner but things didn't work out that way 

262.86 264.07 B: oh i see then 

264.37 269.27 B: (( one of the things )) i mean the way you wanted them or did you agree or disagree on something 

270.49 271.16 A: um 

273.13 274.37 A: it was more like 

274.90 276.56 A: the circumstances 

277.19 278.03 A: weren't right 

278.48 279.04 A: um 

281.70 282.62 A: so 

283.13 284.30 A: i was 

285.83 286.78 A: a 

286.89 289.68 A: to get personal i guess i was about to start um 

290.01 297.73 A: my graduate career and i needed to move across the country and he wasn't willing to do that 

295.27 295.72 B: mhm 

298.00 299.94 A: and so we went our separate ways 

301.40 303.77 B: oh that that's that's really sad 

305.36 308.33 B: but i think yeah the (( )) plays a very important role 

308.74 309.95 B: uh in relationship 

311.78 313.53 B: i mean (( )) 

312.85 313.45 A: how so 

315.95 316.49 B: pardon me 

316.81 317.86 A: how does how do you 

318.03 318.50 A: um 

319.10 323.60 B: i mean yeah i mean if som- i mean if you really don't trust or have 

319.19 319.64 A: figure 

324.89 327.30 B: complete faith in other person you tend to get 

327.51 332.86 B: uh sudden real ideas when (( )) person out for some time 

333.27 335.69 B: i guess that happens but then you have to take it 

335.88 338.57 B: in the right way and just continue on with the relationship 

341.34 343.82 A: so you would be willing to um 

344.47 347.54 A: be involved with somebody who you didn't live close to 

349.32 351.19 B: uh i wouldn't mind actually 

351.94 352.49 A: you wouldn't 

352.15 352.86 B: as long as 

352.96 355.26 B: i (( )) as long as the things worked out 

355.38 360.98 B: the way we wanted them to as long as we think in the same way and as long as we share the same views about 

361.37 362.55 B: the things we care about 

365.55 365.94 A: hmm 

366.48 368.49 A: i i would find that very difficult 

368.81 369.43 A: i think 

371.06 371.64 A: to be 

371.10 371.75 B: yeah 

372.34 378.52 A: involved with somebody who i couldn't see on at least a regular basis if not you know every day 

379.70 386.03 B: yeah but today the technology has improved so much that probably you can uh chat with each other (( )) -cam and talk with each other 

386.47 393.26 B: i mean share your thoughts and how your day was and things like that it would be a lot easier i guess right now 

394.87 398.14 A: yeah i suppose it's easier now than it has been in the past 

398.61 400.48 A: but still it's such a big stress on 

401.37 402.33 A: on the relationship 

401.61 402.36 B: yeah that's true 

402.74 404.76 B: that that's very true i i i 

404.86 407.45 B: i agree with you on that issue i really agree with you on that issue 

409.29 411.02 A: have you been involved in a long 

411.20 412.65 A: distance relationship before 

418.09 422.01 B: for my graduate studies out here she moved to a different state i moved to a different state 

422.57 429.46 B: and she always wanted to be she always wanted me to be there for her which is not very possible when you are doing your graduate career 

430.29 436.64 A: right it's hard to be there for anybody even if you're in the same location once you're doing graduate school 

435.12 435.92 B: exactly 

436.07 436.48 B: exactly 

436.57 440.86 B: ye- yeah so we just decided to go our separate ways 

442.11 442.77 A: right 

444.14 445.15 A: well um 

446.05 447.56 A: did you have any regrets about that 

448.31 448.91 B: pardon 

449.20 451.01 A: did you have any regrets about that 

451.48 452.84 B: uh not anymore 

452.97 456.46 B: not anymore it's it's better to be this way uh than being 

456.55 464.72 B: rude with each other and being unfriendly and having a bad (( )) relationship i think this is uh a much much (( )) approaching the (( )) 

465.05 465.53 B: so 

466.37 467.54 B: her decision 

467.41 468.05 A: mhm 

468.19 469.00 A: i think you're right 

469.61 475.26 B: i think it also depends upon what kind of a graduate career you are in what kind of graduate career are you in 

476.28 478.09 A: um i was studying psychology 

478.97 481.32 B: psychology oh my god that's really nice 

482.37 483.69 A: uh-huh how about you 

484.12 485.80 B: uh i'm doing electrical engineering 

485.93 486.78 B: but um 

486.12 486.56 A: ok- 

486.98 493.82 B: much of my results will be (( )) uh be in psychology in understanding how people think and 

494.47 495.06 B: stuff like that 

496.20 496.63 A: huh 

496.92 497.98 A: oh that's interesting 

498.54 499.41 B: yeah 

500.62 501.21 A: um 

502.50 505.67 A: but i suppose we should stay on the topic i'm not sure why they do these 

505.81 507.43 A: things this way but uh 

507.75 511.23 A: for some reason the want us to talk on the topic of 

511.56 512.33 A: whatever it is 

511.62 515.84 B: (( )) i i i guess (( )) in some way i don't know 

515.96 524.37 B: i i i i think they just want us to keep on talking (( )) keep the topic so that we can talk about something i guess 

524.70 525.89 A: oh okay 

527.25 528.05 B: (( )) 

527.29 530.16 A: i don't know i haven't i've only done it once before 

530.86 531.80 B: oh really 

531.76 532.29 A: uh-huh 

533.27 537.35 B: yeah even me kind of get involved in these things l._d._c. (( )) 

537.46 538.58 B: is one of our 

539.30 543.23 B: uh very favorite place where you can get some data from 

543.91 544.54 A: i'm sorry 

545.30 553.14 B: l._d._c. is a place where we get most some of our data from we also have our data available at l._d._c. we used to have some data from l._d._c. 

555.33 555.86 A: oh 

556.31 556.86 B: yeah
