0.18 1.44 B: hello 

0.86 2.16 A: hello 

2.02 3.50 B: hi how are you 

3.02 4.94 A: okay this is alice 

4.64 6.31 B: i'm raquel how 

5.83 7.03 A: hi raquel 

6.94 8.27 B: are you today 

7.86 9.95 A: i'm just wonderful thank you 

9.93 16.59 B: good good good so do you really want to talk about this airport security topic or do you want to talk about something else 

16.37 18.23 A: ah it doesn't matter to me 

18.69 22.20 A: [laughter] so we could talk airport security 

19.70 20.37 B: (( [laughter] )) 

22.32 24.33 B: (( sure )) 

25.01 31.55 B: i think what the question was do you feel make does it make travel any safer or something like that with the heightened security what do you think you 

31.13 32.46 A: yes i do 

32.67 33.43 B: do 

33.27 34.23 A: yeah 

34.52 36.47 B: (( i don't know i don't )) 

36.61 37.76 A: why's that 

36.77 47.20 B: think it does all those recent little incidents that keep popping up like those people who were getting gotten busted taking coi- ah knives on to the planes and how 

47.49 51.59 B: you know people are just able to get around from plane to plane without identification 

51.77 55.55 B: how about one guy i think it was like he didn't have the to scare his wife 

55.56 62.25 B: he like snuck some box cutters onto a plane not too long ago and that stuff is still happening i don't know 

57.77 59.10 A: mhm 

62.61 73.01 A: well i i have heard of isolated cases where people have taken things onto a plane inadvertently uh nothing that was you know meant to 

73.06 78.36 A: i mean just innocent people who realised afterward they had certain things on their possession 

78.27 79.40 B: mhm 

78.73 81.21 A: but i still think overall that 

81.24 90.86 A: it's much safer flying now than it was a year and a half ago because i mean it's been my experience in my travel over the last couple of months that 

91.02 92.05 A: um 

92.42 97.88 A: it everyone is scrutinized much more severely than they've ever been in the u._s. 

98.28 101.60 A: and um i mean 

98.46 100.18 B: [noise] yeah 

101.84 111.85 A: i just think everyone's more alert and everybody's paying attention and the people they have in place now at least in the airports that i've flown in or out of 

111.32 113.00 B: [noise] 

112.06 116.31 A: um are much more professional and are much more on their toes than 

116.45 118.13 B: (( [noise] )) 

116.58 119.58 A: the folks that were in place a year ago 

119.58 126.64 B: [noise] yeah i do notice that because i i've been traveling too and i have noticed that they do seem i i don't know maybe but they seem to concerned 

126.92 130.00 B: but they are paying a little bit more attention to the detailed stuff 

130.23 132.24 B: so i have noticed that as well 

132.06 136.57 A: i mean my bags have been torn apart every time i travel 

136.34 137.55 B: really 

137.10 141.35 A: yeah i must i must have that look or something i don't know 

137.91 139.06 B: i have not 

141.70 147.56 B: oh no i it's weird because that hasn't happened to me i've been i've flown maybe about four times since then 

147.67 153.62 B: and that hasn't happened to me yet i'm and it's funny because i do run into people who tell me that every time they get stopped 

148.99 149.72 A: yes 

152.86 157.90 A: yeah i i traveled from the u._s. to europe and um 

158.51 166.92 A: all the airports in europe tore my bags apart and in the u._s. they tore them apart and i flew one one ah 

163.41 164.63 B: wow 

166.91 173.66 A: on the way back from one trip a couple of weeks ago they did not check my bags but that 

173.57 174.27 B: (( mm )) 

173.92 176.94 A: you know the other times that i flew they did so i 

177.03 183.38 B: yeah i i've run into people who fly certain parts of the country for instance like texas or florida 

182.91 184.18 A: mhm 

183.57 194.01 B: it they get their bags checked a lot well coming back from texas or florida or california like l._a. or san antonio or miami because they're all like you know near coasts like near the border 

187.72 188.91 A: mhm 

192.47 193.33 A: right 

193.66 194.63 A: right 

194.09 202.57 B: they get all the time all the time but like i don't know because i like the last two times i've been flying i've flown to chicago and ah 

202.90 204.67 B: can't remember where else i went 

204.81 210.50 B: but i i was like flying inland and not near any major borders so i guess maybe that's why i'm not sure 

210.14 213.05 A: how about philadelphia did you fly in or out of philly 

212.84 214.52 B: i was flying out of philly 

214.06 218.00 A: yeah because i mean a- they ripped everything apart in philly 

218.03 219.14 B: wow 

218.39 219.96 A: yeah i mean 

221.06 223.77 A: i don't know [laughter] i mean i had to take my sh- 

222.38 229.08 B: that's weird they must they must be targeting certain are- you know certain i guess popular areas too i guess for smugglers or whatever 

228.27 234.96 A: yeah well i think you know a lot of it is just random checking but my husband set off um 

235.00 240.16 A: the alarm the last time we traveled and so i don't know whether they 

240.18 243.53 A: pulled me aside too just because they pulled him aside 

243.85 246.95 B: actually i did get pulled aside once but not my bags 

246.60 247.62 A: mhm 

247.01 252.37 B: when i walked the metal detector and it was because some metal in my bra set off the alarm 

251.99 253.77 A: right right 

253.20 260.31 B: and i was like oh my god i was so embarrassed and the lady like waved the wand near my chest she was like oh miss it's your bra i'm sorry 

260.20 262.91 A: hey did you hear about that lad- that french lady 

263.64 266.47 A: she she was getting totally pissed off because 

263.69 264.41 B: wh- 

266.55 267.50 A: um 

267.58 272.29 A: it was her bra that was setting off the um the security um 

272.31 285.01 A: you know the wand and everything she did it set off the alarm and it was her bra and she finally got really pissed off and took her blouse and her bra off and said okay now try it 

274.17 275.17 B: (( uh huh )) 

284.80 286.96 B: oh my god

291.73 295.49 B: (( that is funny that is funny i i hadn't heard that )) 

293.93 301.07 A: called the height of the height of frustration [laughter] you know those french they don't care anyway that's no big deal 

296.45 297.92 B: [laughter] 

300.48 305.31 B: that's true they love showing of the body they're very comfortable with it they don't care 

301.08 302.21 A: [laughter] 

302.71 304.10 A: [laughter]

311.38 314.44 B: (( [laughter] funny and that was in u._s. airport )) 

314.85 320.89 A: ah you know i don't really remember this was about probably about six weeks ago or maybe even two months ago 

321.12 326.77 A: and i don't remember if it was in the u._s. she was from france i know that but i don't remember if it was a french 

326.68 327.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

326.99 329.67 A: i don't remember if it was in europe or if it was in the u._s. 

330.54 332.32 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

331.77 336.71 A: it probably wasn't in france though because they i don't think they'd arrest her for indecent exposure 

335.87 337.74 B: nah probably not 

337.09 338.43 A: yeah 

340.04 342.60 B: (( [mn] amazing amazing )) 

341.77 343.45 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] ))

344.79 346.19 A: got to love it [sigh] 

346.67 351.06 B: [mn] well i just hope it gets better because i do plan on traveling again soon

360.66 363.12 A: well a- i think that 

361.74 362.45 B: (( you know )) 

364.29 378.18 A: it's a concern but like everything else in life i mean you never know what's going to happen and you can't live your life around you know worrying about those sort of things you use your best judgment and you 

372.14 373.44 B: [noise] yeah [noise] 

378.41 384.17 A: you you're aware and and think about what you're doing but i mean 

384.65 390.46 A: there's not a whole lot you can do if if ah you're careful and you do everything right and something happens 

390.69 393.78 A: i mean i'm not going to stop flying because of these idiots 

393.25 399.82 B: oh yeah that's r- that's true i mean look the like two weeks after that happened i was in a wedding in houston

399.95 412.94 B: [laughter] and you know the rest of the part- wedding party and myself including the the ma- you know the groom and the bride lived here in philadelphia and we we had no we had i mean we had no choice at that point because we'd already paid for our tickets [noise] 

401.46 402.61 A: oh 

407.87 408.92 A: (( wow )) 

414.76 418.76 A: yeah that i mean i think right after nine eleven 

418.85 427.28 A: flying was very difficult and i mean the airports in the u._s. were always lax i mean really we we've never done a good job 

427.39 428.89 A: of um 

429.40 440.72 A: of you know security in the airports i mean ah i can't think of one u._s. airport that i've ever flown through that i felt was really miami probably more so than 

440.82 443.10 A: any of the other ones but 

443.38 453.03 A: we've never done a good job i mean it's totally different in other parts of the world they have security much more um together than we we have had in the past 

453.06 455.19 A: but i do think we're getting there 

455.61 460.59 A: i mean i see a huge improvement over a year ago [noise]
