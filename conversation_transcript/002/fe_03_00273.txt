45.37 46.81 A: yes 

46.26 49.01 B: so yeah so why is that 

48.85 55.18 A: um because i had i had a business and 

53.65 54.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

55.19 62.78 A: and since nine eleven i have lost many customers because they were out of new york city 

62.95 71.62 B: oh oh because they just they because of the event they they changed their address or they just they just gone away 

71.15 79.67 A: they they reduced their business and there was a a period that it was difficult to to communicate with them 

74.16 75.03 B: oh 

79.85 89.83 B: oh yeah right right so do oh so th- th- that's why your life has been you know specifically you know influenced by by nine one one 

89.27 95.18 A: it definitely because i i was a graphic designer and 

94.33 95.90 B: really wow 

95.22 99.50 A: they it's really reduced my business to the point that i decided to go back to school 

99.73 101.73 B: oh really [laughter] 

100.59 102.48 A: so i changed careers 

102.40 106.57 B: oh that's so dramatic change because of nine one one 

106.07 107.53 A: definitely 

107.27 108.32 B: oh 

108.17 122.61 B: do you think that if you haven't you hadn't uh been having a business or you were a student in time of nine one one event do you think that your life is still going to be changed a lot because of event 

122.03 133.31 A: i don't know if it would be that dramatic of a change but i'm sure in some way it would be affected only because i lived in new york 

133.07 134.16 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

133.12 143.39 A: i was very familiar with the surroundings when i went to visit it was very sad and that's that really triggers memories 

136.91 137.74 B: oh 

143.28 144.07 B: mm 

144.17 148.56 B: do you think that this kind of effect will have a long lasting you know 

149.04 161.72 B: where you know this event you know obviously it has already influenced your life your career but do you think this effect is going to last you know for the coming many years or it's just a temporary effect 

161.54 166.66 A: (( i think i think over time it'll be reduced )) 

166.63 168.12 B: right right 

167.21 172.09 A: 'cause i think that's how memory works you kinda forget the bad stuff 

171.66 180.83 B: right so may- maybe i think those people who like new york maybe most of them or at least some of them has have already you know 

180.73 187.46 B: gone back to new york city so [laughter] you can pick up your own own business [laughter] 

186.69 190.74 A: [laughter] thanks [laughter] 

189.46 193.92 B: (( sometime you just do about your business when you are a student right ))

195.16 196.71 B: [laughter] 

195.75 203.28 A: i do fortunately because i don't have a whole lot of time to work and it's really great to be able to work out of my own house 

202.78 211.79 B: so who uh basically who are your customers are they uh companies or groups or organizations or just individuals or 

210.86 215.71 A: i i i have found that oddly enough most of my clients' 

215.83 219.27 A: a- a- are non profit organizations 

218.18 221.08 B: oh wow that's great 

220.58 222.26 A: yeah 

221.64 227.33 B: [laughter] but are you still stud- studying mm graphic design right now

237.07 237.95 A: [laughter]

242.51 244.38 A: the other side of the brain 

244.38 245.92 B: (( yeah )) 

245.12 246.51 A: [laughter] 

246.21 252.86 B: so do you think it's there actually actually i'm an international student so for me 

253.16 260.22 B: obviously when when nine one one happened it does have it did have a big influence of of 

260.21 268.08 B: you know on me and also of my fellow students here because i i still remember very clearly that 

268.01 280.60 B: on that specific morning one of my classmates she was late for class we had a very early class at nine o'clock and then she came pretty late and the first sentence she said is 

280.63 290.74 B: oh my god do you already know what happened [laughter] and uh everyone including the professor we did know about the event yet so [laughter] 

290.18 293.04 A: yeah yeah it was really interesting i 

291.51 292.99 B: (( such a big shock )) 

293.17 307.48 A: was i was working at this one job and i was listening to the radio on the way in and i think i pretty much just parked in the parking lot when they announced that there something happened and 

302.84 304.02 B: (( oh really )) 

306.68 309.52 B: (( yeah were you in the city oh )) 

308.89 323.84 A: i was um no i was in the suburbs i was in philadelphia but in the suburbs and then um strangely enough the boss that i was working for just remained oblivious to the whole fact and we're listening to the radio 

312.28 313.20 B: oh 

323.69 330.35 A: in horror and he ig- he ignored the entire situation and made us work all day 

323.78 324.54 B: (( right )) 

330.35 331.52 B: yeah 

331.23 333.20 A: it was very bizarre 

332.99 339.16 B: right and uh i remember that school had had been cancelled for two days in our 

338.42 340.55 A: really 

339.94 347.33 B: yeah and uh there are many students there were many students who went for for some some walk out 

347.50 353.81 B: you know and we had we did have a sleepless night [laughter] 

348.39 350.16 A: oh i'm sure 

353.06 360.43 A: yeah and a lot of i had a lot of my friends live up in new york so for days afterwards i heard all sorts of horror stories 

354.83 355.88 B: yeah 

360.26 368.32 A: a friend of mine lived in new jersey and he ran down to the river and basically watched the towers collapsed 

367.50 370.75 B: yeah even yeah right 

368.46 369.93 A: yeah 

371.18 384.72 B: even though many students they do not have any relatives or family members who it's likely you know they influenced the event but i can see that every everyone is very sad particularly during those days 

382.90 383.99 A: yes 

384.53 385.83 A: yes 

385.77 400.13 A: yeah and then when i went to visit um i think it was about two months after it happened it was very somber in the area i- it was just very heavy energy and everyone was really quiet and standing around but you could just 

398.06 400.33 B: yeah right 

400.07 403.94 A: feel the thickness in the air it was unbelievable 

402.62 403.41 B: right 

403.71 407.89 B: right is any of your friends or relatives you 

407.95 411.32 B: know who was in- injured by the 

411.53 412.46 B: by the 

411.57 426.36 A: no fortunately not i actually heard of one person that i sort of knew an acquaintant who had died but i it wasn't confirmed and um mostly otherwise it was just second hand stories 

412.78 413.93 B: (( oh okay )) 

426.08 427.89 B: okay okay [laughter] 

427.05 430.83 A: yeah so fortunately i didn't lose anyone personally 

430.40 437.06 B: yeah but your career has been directly you know changed or influenced by this event 

436.37 438.74 A: definitely definitely 

439.11 441.94 B: so do you think that your how 

442.69 447.80 B: but [laughter] it's you actually you made a very quick decision right so 

446.73 448.01 A: i did 

448.00 452.62 B: i i you had a a company of your own right so you 

451.72 453.10 A: i did 

452.74 457.00 B: you was not you were not working for some other people so that's why you 

455.94 457.15 A: no 

457.14 458.42 B: you have a 

457.29 458.34 A: right 

458.79 462.08 B: you made a very quick response [laughter] 

461.23 468.69 A: exactly 'cause i didn't i just didn't want to be struggling moving forward and so i figured 

468.74 475.87 A: that i needed to make a change that was very balanced and steady and something that i've always been interested in 

475.73 482.31 B: yeah but actually i'm kinda wondering that why do a considerable number of people 

482.38 487.36 B: who moved out of new york city just because of the event because i think they they can 

487.58 493.05 B: they are you know maybe they are worr- worrying about it there's going to be another bombing or 

493.48 499.74 B: because i just cannot see the reason why they should move away immediately after the event 

499.22 500.57 A: (( it the event may )) 

500.48 502.17 A: have just acted as a 

502.00 503.57 A: (( catalyst )) 

503.41 506.86 A: to pr- you know to promote people to start thinking 

503.68 504.79 B: yeah 

506.64 519.03 A: it's i just know from my own personal experience i'm from philadelphia and i moved to new york after i graduated i had a career there and a lot of my it seems like the population in new york goes through cycles 

512.95 513.72 B: (( uh-huh )) 

518.86 528.27 A: so a lot of my friends actually had moved away from the city and i had been there for a long period of time that you just basically get your fill and then you leave 

519.31 520.17 B: yeah 

525.25 526.37 B: yeah 

528.06 534.03 A: so it's not necessarily that they the the event may have promoted the decision 

528.32 529.63 B: mhm 

533.85 535.36 B: okay okay 

534.50 537.26 A: or or or sped it up 

537.37 538.29 B: okay 

537.75 539.52 A: that would be my opinion 

539.56 541.78 B: okay okay [laughter] 

540.95 541.93 A: [laughter] 

542.72 548.33 B: so and um actually because uh i i think 

548.61 552.79 B: i see that my fellow students my fellow american 

552.73 562.26 B: fe- fellow students they uh they were very united during those days i think this is a critical time where something happened where some tragedy happened that 

562.07 575.09 B: they knew have a you know have a strong very strong feeling that it it kind of make make you fear that you are american at this time right [laughter] yeah 

573.00 585.03 A: oh yeah definitely it was like everybody on my block all went out and bought flags and you couldn't even buy them because they were all sold out in the stores it really promoted a patriotic feeling 

582.38 583.32 B: right 

584.70 585.82 B: yeah 

586.02 595.62 B: i'm an international student but i still feel very sad at that time because i because i can see that i i'm living on campus so i see that most of 

595.66 610.08 B: the local people are very friendly and nice and most of my all of my you know fellow students they are so so lovely people so i don't really want to see their lives or or their relatives their friends lives 

610.19 616.56 B: be influenced by such a tragedy so i also feel very sad about this event so 

615.79 627.08 A: yeah you bring up a good point it's like as much as i'm affected in a negative way i'm also affected in a positive way because it does force you to open up to people 

621.68 622.56 B: (( yeah )) 

622.92 624.17 B: right 

626.81 628.06 B: right 

626.91 633.18 A: to be kinder to realize the person next to you is just a person and 

632.47 642.16 B: right yes exactly you know pers- a person is just a person they are human beings so they have their you know love and sadness and everything you know 

641.40 643.18 A: exactly 

643.18 644.35 B: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

644.32 658.82 B: like [laughter] i think because i saw some reports um in newspapers in china i think actually i called my friend in china because they were very concerned about how i feel at that time and i told them 

657.33 658.71 A: oh i'm sure 

658.93 671.97 B: i i told them that actually i feel very sad uh because if i if i was there you know in china then i may be out of play because i really do not have the you know personal feeling i do not con- 

671.82 677.19 B: have a interaction with local people with american with american friend or 

677.08 687.81 B: so maybe i will feel kind of you know you know indifferent because i do not have the personal contact with with american friends so but since 

686.42 687.94 A: right 

687.74 693.73 B: i'm here i do have lots of american friends so i feel very sad about this 

694.02 697.33 B: so that's really different i think [laughter] 

696.31 700.98 A: oh yes yeah it's interesting to see your perspective yeah 

700.35 708.11 B: [laughter] so um actually are you are you which university are you in right now [laughter] 

707.64 709.58 A: university of pennsylvania 

709.50 713.27 B: oh wow that's a great university [laughter] 

712.48 714.26 A: [laughter] 

714.05 719.76 B: you're not living in new york city any more i just are you thinking of moving back 

716.58 717.95 A: no
