0.41 1.67 B: (( hi )) 

1.25 2.77 A: (( hi )) 

2.45 4.54 B: hi uh i'm aida 

4.27 5.26 A: i'm mike 

5.51 7.87 B: hi um where're you calling from 

8.05 9.50 A: i'm in boston 

9.16 12.87 B: okay i'm uh in washington d. c. actually in vienna virginia 

13.08 13.93 A: okay 

13.50 17.74 B: um okay so um who's gonna start [laughter] mhm 

16.97 18.56 A: either way uh 

18.76 25.26 A: i i guess i actually don't feel that my life has changed that much specifically 

25.75 29.32 A: um like i'm a student and uh 

30.03 35.79 A: i've been in boston for the past several years um i'm getting a masters right now 

36.21 46.69 A: and um since i mean obviously right around the time you know a year ago or a year and a couple a months back the attacks occurred um you know things sort of you know everybody 

47.15 55.83 A: changed then and sort of you know was a little on guard and there were all that but i wasn't i'm not a really big traveler i guess and uh 

51.21 52.01 B: (( mhm right )) 

54.79 55.50 B: (( mhm )) 

56.43 65.43 A: so i didn't have to make any adjustment sort of in that respect i remember there was one time there was a scare about you know maybe potential terrorism in boston 

65.58 79.89 A: uh you know some people said don't go downtown on this day because there might be an attack of some kind um so but other than that like major changes [sigh] made like i i don't feel that i actually have 

70.65 71.80 B: mhm 

79.67 80.85 A: so much 

82.00 82.99 B: mhm 

83.17 84.82 A: how 'bout for you 

84.35 85.55 B: um 

85.73 87.73 B: i feel like um 

88.19 98.77 B: i'm i've probably made more changes than i think i'm aware of of couple uh for sure uh i actually um [lipsmack] was living 

98.81 105.79 B: right next to the pentagon complex uh on september eleventh and so i was able to 

103.35 104.16 A: wow 

105.84 116.78 B: to see uh the attack and the explosion and hear the plane fly over my building so um [lipsmack] i was pretty um traumatized i should say um 

117.01 119.58 B: [lipsmack] from the whole experience and for me 

119.59 122.07 B: uh this was um 

122.16 129.99 B: this felt like a cont- continuation of stuff that i experienced in my home- home country i'm um [lipsmack] originally from bosnia 

130.11 130.97 A: okay 

130.19 134.68 B: and so i basically came over to the united states 

134.65 144.14 B: um fleeing the war that was going on in in my country [lipsmack] and that was affecting me and my family to a large extend 

144.05 154.18 B: um so to me i guess coming to the united states i felt like i was um [lipsmack] you know away from a lot of the trauma that i was experiencing at at home 

154.30 168.36 B: and so uh to be uh a witness to um you know to this attack was really you know to me felt like a continuation of of a lot of things that i already experienced and so um [lipsmack] 

168.48 174.63 B: i couldn't really you know ignore the fact [laughter] that it happened i mean even if i hadn't had this 

174.71 183.96 B: you know this experience at home i'm sure that i would have had a pretty strong reaction and traumatic reaction to what i'd seen happening here 

184.01 190.76 B: just you know you know from you know how you know how many people's lives were lost and what kinds of destruction i was able to 

190.67 195.34 B: to see right outside of my well my home in the un- in the united states 

195.26 205.81 B: so um i made uh a couple of adjustments right away which was basically i couldn't concentrate i'm also in school i'm a graduate student 

205.94 215.87 B: and um and i found that i couldn't concentrate on any of my work right after the attack and so i moved out of the 

216.08 225.87 B: old apartment where i was living [lipsmack] and moved to the suburbs um of washington d. c. [lipsmack] where i felt that um you know i wasn't 

225.85 233.46 B: you know near the airport that's much i didn't hear the planes my biggest issue then was that i was always hearing the planes 

233.52 241.05 B: for even the military planes or any other kinds of plane flying you know above my head and that just was really not helping me 

240.93 253.46 B: [lipsmack] you know deal with what i you know what i've experienced so i think that was the major change that i consciously made uh you know in order to be able to continue with my own work um 

244.05 244.93 A: right 

253.69 258.32 B: [lipsmack] in terms of my behavior um i might say that um 

258.53 262.83 B: in in those first months i was probably more vigilant than now 

262.98 265.88 B: uh probably um 

266.14 272.25 B: [lipsmack] you know again it's hard for me to separate you know my experience at home and what happened here 

272.08 284.02 B: like how much of my behavior was basically just [sigh] you know implants by this earlier experience and whether i was just do you see what i mean like i cannot tell that i was responding just to september eleventh 

278.48 279.24 A: right 

280.81 281.84 A: yeah 

283.78 284.84 A: right 

284.71 292.27 B: and um and also um lot's see but in terms of like flying and so forth i definitely flew from then 

292.35 297.88 B: on and um and i wasn't i mean i i might have thoughts 

297.87 312.14 B: you know about you know possible accidents or you know hijacking or some something but you know i always was secure enough when i entered a plane that it doesn't even cross my mind that something like this could you know happen 

312.27 313.30 B: (( [lipsmack] again )) 

312.42 327.41 A: yeah i guess uh i actually i flew for the first time since uh a couple of months ago i i took a trip a road trip to california with a friend of mine and i knew i got i only had a short amount of time to go so we drove out there and then i flew back a couple of days later 

317.50 318.52 B: uh-huh 

321.07 322.10 B: uh-huh 

327.09 328.19 B: mhm 

327.45 335.47 A: and i didn't uh actually i mean i think that it seems that you know with all the precautions that have been taken it seems like it's probably safer now to fly 

335.38 339.56 A: than it was before i mean if not only because people are being 

339.36 353.80 A: much more watchful and much more strict about you know checking people and letting people on planes with you know certain amounts of things and um so i guess that wasn't a big change but one other thing that i remembered is i guess uh 

343.05 344.06 B: yeah 

353.58 364.90 A: this isn't necessarily something that [mn] i actively felt like a change of what i've done but i think in my attitude i guess i just i never i've never been one to 

364.88 374.29 A: really closely follow like news and world events and political appearances um but this was definitely made it difficult to avoid doing that and uh 

367.23 369.05 B: mhm mhm 

374.70 380.11 A: i feel that since [sigh] that time uh i at least uh 

380.12 385.66 A: i more keep up with uh with what is going on at least in that situation 

383.25 384.35 B: mhm 

385.67 389.02 A: or in like you know the war on terrorism that we have now or 

388.11 389.31 B: right right 

389.32 400.56 A: um so it's just that it's sort of altered you know my mindset um basically like i actually got a job um an internship after 

399.28 400.35 B: mhm 

401.10 404.35 A: um which happened to be like in november last year 

403.88 405.02 B: mhm 

404.43 414.50 A: um where some of the things that we were doing um involved reading uh news articles so that helped me keep up as well until i got much more involved just with what uh with 

414.66 422.20 A: what was going on and so again it's not necessarily a direct result of of the attacks but uh 

420.98 422.02 B: sure 

422.35 432.61 A: but indirectly um obviously every like [sigh] anyone who found out anybody who is you know anywhere near [mn] or knew anybody like i have a lot of friends uh 

433.07 436.53 A: who i'm originally from new jersey so i have a lot of friends in that area 

434.97 436.96 B: mhm mhm 

436.62 440.96 A: um and i have like you know relatives and friends in new york city 

441.07 442.22 A: um 

442.21 454.32 A: [lipsmack] and i guess i mean obviously i'm not there now so they would probably be more affected than me but even i guess the people that i know there um like my mother and my grandmother 

449.31 450.13 B: right 

454.28 458.75 A: they uh you know nobody i know um was 

458.85 461.90 A: you know was hurt or worse 

460.34 462.04 B: mhm mhm 

461.91 468.36 A: um but and i i don't think anyone [sigh] anyone that i know has really taken any 

468.61 474.09 A: extreme action you know to alter their lives i think everyone that i know is pretty much 

470.71 472.56 B: right right 

474.12 478.43 A: just going you know going about their business like because on the level that we 

478.57 486.37 A: can do anything you know all we can do is you know i guess you know move to a safer place or you know somewhere that we think is more out of harm's way 

483.13 484.16 B: (( yes )) 

485.16 486.62 B: mhm mhm 

486.60 488.86 A: but other than that we're not uh 

489.55 496.01 A: or you know flying less or doing you know doing go going places that we don't think paris i'm not gonna go or or 

492.03 492.96 B: yeah 

495.35 496.43 B: yeah 

496.32 506.41 A: or target but other than that there's not a whole lot that we as you know common people i think but can ultimately do other than you know be aware and alert and these are 

506.44 515.23 B: yeah i i totally agree with it i think when you mentioned the point about like whether you watch the news more or less as opposed to before i think that 

507.18 508.46 A: and pay attention 

515.40 525.87 B: you know i've had like two phases like right after the attacks i was constantly listening to the news and watching and you know you know trying to hear new information 

525.80 540.46 B: but at this point i'm actually the opposite like i tried to read as little as possible um i mean i read for example the local you know washington post and and whatnot and read the major news but um 

540.66 545.68 B: once you know i realized that all these t. v. houses are make you know 

545.53 557.27 B: basically [sigh] all they're doing in many ways you know in their reports and in what kinds of um how should i say fears they try to instigate in in you know people 

557.77 561.32 B: and considering that i you know might be somebody who 

561.26 573.48 B: who can be affected by you know that pretty easily you know then i decided that i'm not gonna [laughter] i'm not gonna listen to everything and i'm not gonna read anything [laughter] like i used to do before 

573.72 586.46 B: um and reading the post i feel that okay if there is something important that i need to find out you know i will i will read it and i [laughter] even from the post [laughter] 

574.55 575.63 A: (( yeah makes sense )) 

585.47 590.12 A: yeah that that makes a lot of sense you don't need to know everything just the major points 

586.80 587.78 B: yeah 

590.56 595.86 B: yeah i it all depends on like what kind of reader you are and so forth and i find that um 

595.88 610.23 B: sometimes i guess because i wasn't even um brought up in this culture and so forth like you know i tend to trust you know the news and you know i just take it as a fast safe way that you know people will be 

610.25 618.27 B: you know writing to the advantage of the readership but they usually don't [laughter] 

615.55 616.34 A: right 

617.62 618.57 A: so 

618.81 620.18 A: do you know uh 

620.54 629.83 A: do they uh this is my first one of these that i've that i've gotten to the i feel like we've been talking i've timed it for ten minutes um if it comes on and tells you to stop or 

626.43 627.55 B: yeah 

629.55 633.68 B: yes um i i did it yesterday and um 

633.75 646.28 B: the the program yeah the the robot says you have like thirty seconds and you should greet each other i mean say goodbye to each other and um and then i guess um 

642.87 643.74 A: okay 

646.37 653.11 B: they ask you to give feedback but yesterday didn't work in my case i was on the line but it just got got disconnected 

650.12 650.89 A: okay 

653.72 663.28 B: so hopefully the robot knows [laughter] will come up soon because i also don't know what else to say about september eleventh [laughter] 

653.85 654.76 A: i see 

663.33 667.40 A: yeah um i guess we've just uh 

668.46 669.84 A: pretty much 

669.85 676.60 A: said most of like you know keeping more like at least i'm more aware of you know the major players in the 

676.44 690.28 A: you know in this ongoing in the political system like sort of like i guess i'd never really you know knew who osama bin laden was or i didn't know much about the taliban and what was going on in afghanistan and everything like 

690.24 695.49 A: maybe you had more of a more insight because you when did you when did you come from there i 

695.25 697.34 B: i came in ninety four 

697.71 698.99 B: um 

699.06 707.05 B: and so i've been i've been back to the region a couple of times um but i've been here all these years 

709.02 710.23 A: see 

711.31 712.44 A: so 

712.61 713.36 A: (( mm )) 

715.37 717.41 A: what are you studying in school 

716.96 719.90 B: um i study uh linguistics and my area
