0.13 1.74 B: heather holmes 

0.52 1.58 A: hi 

1.78 2.56 B: hi 

1.83 3.98 A: hi i'm i'm corrine 

3.62 5.64 B: hi corrine this is heather holmes 

5.50 6.60 A: hi heather 

6.11 7.50 B: nice to meet you 

7.28 8.61 A: good to meet you 

8.18 9.39 B: [laughter] 

8.95 11.41 A: so we're going to talk about um 

11.55 16.30 A: the security and the effect on what do we think that there's a 

16.43 24.85 A: um that we're safer because of the security if there's a a decreased chance of attacks yeah 

19.25 20.52 B: right 

22.05 23.51 B: terrorist attacks 

24.12 25.45 B: (( what do you think )) 

25.23 35.59 A: well i'm not too impressed with the security folks that i've seen so ah the way it's currently implemented i don't i would say no i don't think that there i don't feel any safer 

28.48 29.51 B: okay 

35.63 41.60 A: um it seems that people don't really care much when they're checking i don't know if you've flown a lot since 

40.84 41.91 B: yeah 

41.63 45.02 A: in the last year but um i don't know what do you think 

43.57 49.99 B: i actually yeah i have flown a lot and i'm it's very inconsistent um 

50.01 51.73 B: i'll get stopped 

52.04 63.20 B: for even my jewelry on in one direction and when i'm coming back the other way i won't get stopped for things in my bag you know what i mean and it just it doesn't i i'm not sure how effective 

58.93 61.15 A: mhm [noise] 

63.21 65.73 B: it actually is i think that 

65.81 68.79 B: (( um it may be a )) 

69.02 70.62 B: somewhat symbolic 

70.78 80.52 B: you know if if people are feeling safer you know that may be part of the point like what they sobriety checkpoints you know talking about yeah like that sort of thing 

71.30 73.30 A: i think so too right 

76.28 79.11 A: yeah like we're doing something yeah 

80.26 81.79 A: just doing something 

81.42 82.65 B: right 

81.86 90.40 A: yeah no i i think so too but i don't think it really makes any difference maybe it makes us feel better but i don't really think that it makes us any safer but 

89.64 90.86 B: right 

90.79 99.18 A: but i guess it is good to feel like something is being done instead of nothing because one of the most frustrating feelings is that if you think just nothing is being done 

99.41 102.17 B: right but i guess i would 

102.21 103.64 B: ask them 

103.94 109.70 B: what is the role of law enforcement then you know what i mean like a- are they supposed to 

110.48 115.69 B: be there symbolically are they supposed to be spending their time actually doing something that's going to 

115.28 121.42 A: you mean all the the airport um security officers that we see standing around a lot of the time 

117.87 119.22 B: right right 

120.19 124.67 B: right right right i mean could those resources be better used elsewhere 

123.72 125.68 A: for something else yeah 

125.08 126.67 B: or is that 

125.69 126.83 A: i think so 

127.03 133.85 A: i think for instance one of the things that bothers me is when you when you're sitting on the plane and you see these um 

133.89 140.92 A: um yeah trucks coming and going putting the food on and everything i wonder if those are well checked or not because 

140.17 142.37 B: which which i'm sorry which bags 

141.88 148.66 A: the people um carrying the baggage around um and bringing food and different things to service the aircraft 

147.92 150.34 B: oh oh you mean employees of the airline 

150.65 155.80 A: well or employees of the airport or employees of the gas companies 

155.85 164.29 A: you know i wonder if anything is done to check them maybe it is but it doesn't uh seem so obvious to me when i'm sitting there on the plane 

156.54 157.79 B: right 

164.19 165.36 B: that's true 

165.53 166.56 B: although 

165.73 171.72 A: you know it seems like a lot of airports you could easily get on to the the runways and the um 

172.25 184.51 A: um the gate areas on the ground from outside there not secure at least where i've been you could easily get onto any of the runways just put on some clothes that make you look like you're working for the airlines 

174.59 175.52 B: (( uh-uh )) 

180.81 182.07 B: right 

184.52 189.74 A: and you could come across with anything in your bag and stick anything with the luggage 

189.40 194.93 B: mm i never thought about that i don't [laughter] it never occurred to me um 

195.30 202.40 B: i i was thinking about actually the fact that i i am glad that they do have security checks i don't know that they 

202.55 209.84 B: do anything for terrorism or not but i'm glad that people can't get on planes with guns you know i think that they would notice something like that 

210.41 218.07 A: i would hope so i still think that it's very like that they could get on with things and cause as much trouble as the people did on september eleventh because they didn't 

211.41 212.30 B: [laughter] 

218.08 221.30 A: have any guns from what i understand they just had knives 

219.74 222.89 B: right oh absolutely absolutely but 

221.98 227.68 A: but i i i think people can still get on with things like that so that worries me no doubt 

227.34 229.62 B: well it's a deterrent though 

230.05 231.46 A: yeah i hope so [noise] 

230.86 241.07 B: at least i don't know i mean i would be more hesitant knowing that there's a possibility that they might find it to try to go through security with something that i'm not supposed to have 

238.14 238.99 A: yeah 

240.07 250.08 A: yeah i mean i don't know what else to do but a- and still make it possible for people to fly and it seems like it is important for people to fly or 

250.10 253.27 A: the economy's going to be even worse affected so 

252.47 253.58 B: yeah 

253.87 263.35 A: and i fly i mean i think it we're not too secure but i think that um there are a lot of ways that people can cause trouble in this country 

263.34 273.99 A: without um just something about the airlines and i would be shocked if they whoever is trying to cause trouble tries to do the same thing twice so i don't think that 

266.82 267.85 B: right 

274.58 281.29 A: i don't think it makes that much difference with the checking of the airlines now because i don't think that's what's go- what's going to be the um 

280.67 281.98 B: right 

281.72 284.98 A: the sensitive point next time [laughter] 

283.30 284.40 B: yeah 

285.22 288.32 A: do you continue to fly and do you worry about 

287.72 291.39 B: do i actually fly more than i did before 

291.77 292.80 B: um 

292.26 294.13 A: it on purpose or 

293.54 302.73 B: oh well not for that reason but but just because like the situations in my life have made it so that i actually fly more than before i guess i've probably flown about 

298.73 299.64 A: uh-huh 

302.72 309.20 B: six or seven times in the last year i guess that's probably about right and it usually 

304.63 305.66 A: mhm 

305.71 306.72 A: yeah 

308.29 310.23 A: i think i have too yeah 

309.35 310.09 B: yeah 

310.13 312.33 B: i'm usually i go back and forth 

312.51 316.39 B: um between two cities i'm not really flying anywhere far 

314.86 315.81 A: uh-huh 

316.58 318.14 B: but um 

318.39 323.83 B: i do notice the inconsistencies of security checks it's just i've 

322.24 323.17 A: uh-huh 

323.69 330.25 A: it's just you personally or to the other people around you to do you does that or can you tell if 

329.51 331.71 B: well i'm always flying alone 

330.41 332.00 A: (( it's inconsistent )) 

332.10 335.42 B: so i'm not sure what you mean by consistency with what 

332.18 333.05 A: yeah 

335.68 349.81 A: well i mean are there some airports that you fly through or do you only through two it may be hard to tell well you feel that people um that there's very little done to check flyers in other airports where you feel like uh there are a lot of um 

340.74 341.93 B: right 

349.90 357.34 A: security staff around and um a very what appears to be they're all sort of checking the people getting on the planes 

356.79 362.47 B: right well i think actually what's i've noticed is that it varies by time of day 

362.64 369.28 A: oh interesting i haven't noticed that i think my part it definitely varies because i fly into several different airports but 

363.72 364.57 B: (( it would )) 

365.03 365.97 B: um 

369.76 370.85 B: yeah 

369.94 370.95 A: um 

370.86 371.91 B: that 

371.28 373.77 A: but at what time of day difference do you notice 

373.13 386.23 B: well i usually fly either on thursday friday and then come back on monday and tuesday or i'm sorry sunday and monday and early early in the morning like six thirty the the 

382.16 383.05 A: uh-huh 

385.19 386.33 A: mhm 

386.21 391.64 B: days are some heavy checks you know what i mean like they're going through they're scanning everybody you know what i mean 

388.89 389.82 A: uh-huh 

391.71 400.67 B: just it's the lines are a little bit slower at that time um about sunday night it goes a little quicker [laughter] you know 

399.92 402.97 A: interesting yeah well in 

401.61 408.25 B: yeah i mean it's just from my experience you know but i don't you know it just occurred to me but 

407.62 411.09 A: do you feel less safe then sunday night or 

411.13 413.12 A: do you think it's all about the same anyway 

412.63 422.59 B: no but it's funny when i'm taking a re- weekend trip and i get stopped on the way there and they check through my bags and everything because something went off but then on the way back it doesn't even beep 

417.70 418.62 A: uh-huh 

422.54 424.22 A: and it's exactly the same 

423.34 426.83 B: and it's all the same stuff that i took with me and brought back 

426.17 427.63 A: [laughter] 

426.96 429.37 B: and [laughter] you know it happens 

428.37 430.03 A: well that's a little strange 

429.52 432.88 B: right it happens a lot actually 

432.09 433.40 A: interesting 

432.69 444.82 B: i would say that i'm used to that you know happening and usually i'll i just expect it to go off when i walk through because of my earrings and sometimes it won't it just doesn't but it goes it goes off in one direction and doesn't in the other 

442.41 443.25 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

444.46 447.72 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

445.71 447.15 B: (( so that )) 

447.64 449.24 B: is my faith in the 

448.01 451.98 A: you must have quite some some earrings some heavy metal earrings [laughter] 

450.89 457.56 B: oh no not at all not at all [laughter] not at all small silver hoops my you know they'll go off where 

452.76 454.48 A: [laughter] 

457.68 462.11 B: you know but only in one direction or my hairclips i guess 

457.73 458.92 A: wow 

459.18 460.15 A: (( [noise] )) 

462.21 463.79 B: that's probably it 

462.77 463.55 A: (( oh )) 

463.58 474.05 A: yeah um my husband um when when we're flying together i notice that the buckle on his belt often sets things he almost always just has to take it off and hand it to people 

473.19 474.78 B: right right 

474.48 476.74 A: it so often sets things off 

476.39 479.61 B: yeah in all directions or just sometimes 

478.99 486.54 A: yeah [laughter] but i had maybe we always fly at the same time i hadn't noticed this difference about the time 

479.89 481.40 B: [laughter] 

486.54 496.25 B: yeah i mean you'll you'll see you know how when you get on at the beginning of your shift you're very energetic about what you're doing and then you know by the end you're just not so much 

493.94 495.41 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

496.14 497.45 A: yeah 

496.83 498.72 B: yeah but 

498.06 504.18 A: does it bother you if i mean either way does it make you irritated because you're in a hurry or does it bother you 

504.44 507.04 A: if they're if you think they're not doing a good job 

506.77 508.97 B: um what was the first part of that i'm sorry 

508.58 518.31 A: does it bother you if you think that they're being very very careful and you're in a hurry or does it i mean does the security issue bother you a lot compared to what it used to 

518.16 519.17 B: um 

518.43 519.83 A: in either direction 

519.41 521.67 B: i actually didn't fly 

521.75 523.45 B: often at all 

523.73 525.40 B: over a year and a half ag 

525.61 534.08 B: i almost never so this has actually been mostly in the last year so i don't notice a difference only 'cause i don't really have much to compare it to 

525.67 526.64 A: uh-huh 

531.59 532.50 A: yeah 

534.26 540.81 B: um but i usually i'll get there probably between and hour and an hour and a half before my flight and have no problem 

540.89 548.33 B: getting in no matter what time of day it is and i just i haven't noticed a difference i mean it's major city airports too so 

541.08 542.02 A: uh-huh 

543.13 544.34 A: yeah 

547.73 562.20 A: the only time i notice a really really slow process was th- the first month or so after september eleventh last year and it was it was quite noticeable i thought how long it took and i felt well you know of course they have to do this but 

554.91 555.96 B: okay 

561.95 562.95 B: yeah 

562.36 569.87 A: um it was um difficult because you had to get to the airport so long in advance and i noticed what was inconsistent to me was at one time 

570.08 571.00 A: um 

571.02 574.15 A: it took about two hours to get through one airport 

573.70 574.74 B: mhm 

574.52 579.81 A: so that i felt am i ever going to make it or not and there was this long long long long lines 

579.76 584.86 A: and then the um the next airport that i was flying through was on that same trip 

584.76 595.87 A: again they were still saying that you had to be there three hours in advance even for a domestic flight and there was almost nothing and we just zipped right through and so we ended up sitting there for two hours yeah [laughter] [noise] 

587.63 588.29 B: (( mm )) 

591.94 594.05 B: sat at the airport for two hours 

594.27 603.76 B: [laughter] i know it's hard to tell i'm actually i err on the side of caution and i show up earlier just in case because you know with all the 

604.16 612.53 B: changes and the flights and what's going on with a lot of the airlines you know you can't miss your flight or there's nothing you can do about it you know 

606.94 607.89 A: sure 

612.17 616.52 A: right right because it is your fault if you're not there at the right amount of time before 

612.67 613.70 B: so 

615.93 630.46 B: right right so i have a i think it's it's actually a pretty inconsistent i think the security lines some weekends it'll be busier than others so i haven't figured out exactly what that perfect amount of time is to get there 

617.11 618.27 A: right 

630.23 635.43 A: yeah i guess what they say now in some airports an hour and a half and some airports an hour 

635.72 636.64 B: yeah 

636.02 636.91 A: so 

636.93 637.92 A: um 

637.62 640.72 B: i don't know i usually i try to about that 

640.91 644.24 B: amount of time is what i usually leave myself 

642.59 647.93 A: have you have you had any problem ah making a flight ever or are you always there in plenty of time 

647.59 658.23 B: only when it snows but no [laughter] not really that doesn't count that doesn't count [laughter] but no i haven't i haven't had any problems making flights 

649.64 653.76 A: yeah but that's not really the security's fault yeah right 

653.80 654.94 A: yeah 

656.99 668.62 A: yeah i haven't had any problems since that very first month um we flew somewhere i think it was even in october like just about a month after and that was tough but then after that it really hasn't been a problem yeah 

665.61 666.51 B: mhm 

667.86 671.63 B: were you there two hours early or less than that or 

670.65 674.91 A: yeah like three hours early and still we ended up fifth in line 

672.57 673.71 B: wow 

674.91 687.12 A: um we were just moved back and forth and back and forth and there were just um they were just uh being very caref- being very thorough so understandably and it just took a very long time to get through 

683.33 684.15 B: uh-huh 

686.98 691.40 B: how different is it now than it was a year and a half ago 

691.60 696.24 A: def- i think it's a lot faster now they're saying at some airports it's just an hour 

694.36 698.54 B: well i mean like over the summer a year ago not 

698.58 700.14 A: (( um )) 

698.88 701.93 B: not since september eleventh but beforehand 

701.71 703.54 A: oh before september eleventh 

702.39 705.48 B: yeah how was it compared to how it is right now 

703.99 704.76 A: oh 

705.49 713.10 A: oh you could show up you know almost within ten minutes before the absolute deadline when the airline has the right to cancel your ticket and you could still walk on 

713.12 714.40 B: (( oh okay )) 

713.13 716.20 A: and and you could just dash right through security and 

716.26 719.89 A: you know just say i'm late i have a flight to catch and they would really
