120.26 121.53 A: yeah that's great 

122.71 124.51 B: so i guess we're supposed to be talking about 

125.49 126.35 B: life partners 

126.33 126.94 A: right 

127.71 128.34 B: and uh 

128.55 131.79 B: the most important thing to look for or something like that 

131.73 132.57 A: right 

133.29 134.57 A: do you want to start or do you want me to start 

134.58 135.47 B: um 

135.97 136.77 B: why don't you start 

136.86 137.42 A: okay 

138.10 141.32 A: well i i think one the most important things to look for 

141.82 142.54 A: is 

142.76 146.71 A: some one who is willing to except you as you are 

146.85 147.44 A: and not 

147.85 150.55 A: someone who is looking to change you 

151.23 151.96 A: um 

152.18 153.13 A: i think i see 

153.61 157.94 A: people who i know who have gotten in trouble who marriages have gotten in trouble 

158.08 160.80 A: because they married some one and with the 

160.93 162.82 A: expectation that they can change them 

163.77 165.77 A: and my experience is that 

166.02 172.18 A: you know people like the way they are there's not a lot you can do to change them unless they decide top change themselves 

172.02 173.86 B: yeah that's defiantly true 

172.77 173.21 A: so 

173.73 176.01 A: so when looking for someone who 

176.98 179.68 A: a i don't feel i'm going to have to change 

180.37 181.42 A: and b doesn't 

181.76 183.24 A: feel they don't have to change me 

183.42 183.76 B: yeah 

183.51 185.80 A: is prob- is a very important thing in 

185.93 187.16 A: in looking for a life partner 

187.63 188.53 B: i'd agree with that 

189.44 190.66 B: um i think 

192.55 193.36 B: uh 

193.64 194.26 B: well one of the 

195.07 197.49 B: important things for me was finding someone that 

199.03 201.49 B: wanted the same kinds of things out of life 

201.65 202.62 A: mhm 

201.81 202.19 B: um 

203.50 204.68 B: like with similar 

204.77 205.70 B: goals and i- 

205.88 206.60 B: goals 

208.37 210.70 B: like how we wanted to live 

211.67 212.19 B: (( our )) 

213.60 215.53 B: we wanted to spend money 

215.83 217.26 B: and of course you never find someone who 

217.92 220.37 B: exactly like you and that would be boring if you did 

220.48 220.81 B: but 

220.48 220.92 A: right 

221.98 223.21 B: but it's nice to 

224.11 226.39 B: it's nice to have goals in common because that way 

227.81 228.31 B: uh 

228.74 229.40 B: you know when 

229.62 231.46 B: problems come up and there's always problems 

231.69 233.21 B: the you then you can say well 

233.99 238.22 B: uh this is still what we're trying to get the place we're trying to get to or what we're working for and 

239.26 240.93 B: and uh let's look at the 

241.23 243.59 B: possible solutions that may help us get there 

243.62 244.11 A: mhm 

245.70 247.29 B: i think it's also really important to marry 

247.45 249.77 B: who well not i guess life partner doesn't nes- 

249.88 251.22 B: necessarily imply marriage but 

251.00 251.58 A: right 

251.55 253.19 B: you um find some one that 

255.05 256.29 B: uh that you can be 

256.99 259.63 B: and this is like what you said but you can be totally yourself with 

259.76 260.32 A: right 

260.31 264.43 B: so you can be you funny self or your mad self or your serious self 

263.77 264.12 A: mhm 

265.70 267.84 B: or your creative or crazy or 

269.14 270.32 B: grouchy 

271.49 272.09 B: that will 

272.25 273.98 B: that like you said will 

274.45 275.96 B: love you as you are and uh 

278.45 281.72 A: right you know it worked for us but we had 

282.17 283.32 A: a lot of 

283.71 284.31 A: um 

284.97 286.03 A: things in common 

286.55 288.73 A: that we found as we got to know each other 

288.86 289.23 B: mhm 

289.11 290.21 A: like we had watched 

290.50 292.17 A: this same t._v. shows growing up 

292.13 293.24 B: uh-huh 

292.58 294.78 A: and we had listen to the same music 

295.09 298.60 A: and we had other things in common uh 

299.09 300.37 A: it's interesting because 

300.63 303.14 A: you know i've never really necessary thought that was 

303.35 309.46 A: something that was necessary because you see plenty of successful couples who are opposites 

309.55 310.14 B: that's true 

310.23 310.80 A: you know 

311.05 313.22 A: but but we we were very much 

313.59 314.28 A: the same 

314.88 317.87 A: we we had a lot a lot of interest in common 

318.30 322.33 A: and i i think that was nice to be able to you know 

322.50 331.51 A: basically make a reference to something and your partner gets it immediately with out having to explain it 

327.40 328.08 B: right 

328.65 329.19 B: yeah 

330.18 330.88 B: yeah 

332.00 333.71 B: yeah that's one of the nice things about 

334.49 336.38 B: well for us too cause we're both 

336.78 337.83 B: children of the eighties 

338.04 338.55 A: mhm 

338.37 339.35 B: you know so 

340.32 341.18 B: we have all that 

343.49 345.81 A: wow children of the eighties that's funny 

346.05 348.67 A: because no i i just thinking because 

346.23 347.34 B: well i mean we were 

348.77 354.21 A: you know because i was an adult of the eighties 

351.07 351.69 B: okay 

352.33 353.34 B: yeah well we're 

354.50 355.70 B: we're not we're just 

356.01 356.75 B: we're almost thirty 

357.15 357.67 A: mhm 

359.56 360.12 A: uh 

360.58 362.79 A: so anything else that strikes you 

364.70 365.80 B: i think 

367.05 369.60 B: well something that was important to us was that we wanted 

371.00 372.09 B: well i wanted and 

372.21 373.50 B: then he also wanted 

373.92 375.40 B: to find someone who was 

376.28 376.76 B: um 

377.12 378.94 B: willing to make a commitment is say 

379.74 380.40 B: um 

383.93 386.08 B: i will be totally faithful to you and 

386.68 388.83 B: not only will i be totally faithful to you 

389.32 390.00 B: while 

390.95 392.19 B: while we're married 

392.28 392.65 A: mhm 

392.37 393.53 B: but i will 

395.00 395.55 B: um 

396.52 399.94 B: rather than consider divorces and option or breaking up and option 

400.48 401.72 B: we once your married 

401.90 402.26 A: right 

402.46 402.93 B: then 

403.81 406.17 B: i want to work thought the problems rather than say 

407.74 409.15 B: you know this just isn't working 

409.28 410.28 B: have a nice life 

410.17 410.65 A: mhm 

411.19 413.65 B: and that that was important to me i don't know that 

415.05 416.48 B: that's important to everyone 

417.04 420.83 A: yeah you know that's it's it's something where i look at it as 

421.27 422.31 A: that's almost a given 

422.51 423.66 A: or it should be a given 

424.40 424.74 B: yeah 

424.87 428.71 A: that that you you go you know you go into a life relationship 

428.91 430.40 A: um you want to call it marriage or not 

431.04 431.42 A: but 

431.54 433.85 A: you should go in committed 

434.21 434.96 A: for life 

435.09 435.56 B: right 

435.68 436.39 A: and that's it 

436.52 436.97 B: right 

437.05 438.79 A: you know um 

439.15 439.83 A: that 

441.69 442.37 A: make 

442.48 449.97 A: find that's right again i come back to you know this is a person who you can live with 

450.27 451.26 A: with out changing them 

450.37 450.70 B: yeah 

451.43 451.69 B: right 

452.13 455.52 A: and i don't think enough people ask that question before hand 

456.17 456.82 B: yeah 

456.39 460.51 A: something they like about the person something that attracts them to the person 

461.30 461.97 A: and 

462.14 462.82 A: they 

462.94 463.31 A: they 

463.41 467.27 A: don't look beyond that they think well this annoys me but you know 

464.72 465.22 B: yeah 

467.42 470.26 A: once we're married he'll change or she'll change 

468.95 469.77 B: it'll be different 

470.04 470.43 B: yeah 

471.38 471.74 B: yeah 

472.35 476.69 A: so that that's where i think you know i i i agree with your statements 

477.16 480.00 A: but i also think something like that should be a given 

480.50 480.86 B: yea 

480.96 482.47 A: that you know you your 

482.67 484.88 A: you you go into this with the 

485.26 487.43 A: idea that your going into this for life 

488.21 488.93 A: and that 

489.05 493.58 A: problems you goin- you may have problems your probably going to have problems but 

493.77 495.41 A: there's things that should be worked out 

495.54 495.96 B: right 

496.28 497.46 A: right not just given up on 

496.82 497.23 B: yeah 

497.83 499.17 B: i think um 

500.35 501.91 B: you know if you take the time 

502.94 504.04 B: if you take time as 

504.47 508.54 B: the relationship if your getting to know each other to really get to know each other then you can 

509.46 510.36 B: make that kind of 

511.49 512.28 B: assessment 

513.83 514.25 B: uh 

514.68 516.00 B: fairly accurately because 

516.04 516.43 A: mhm 

516.92 517.47 B: you know if you 

517.57 518.74 B: spent time together and 

519.88 522.33 B: oh something else i think is really important is um 

524.91 527.15 B: like when you choose a life partner your (( )) 

527.34 529.13 B: well most of the time your also choosing 

530.22 531.61 B: um to become part of that person 

531.78 534.10 B: family and have that person become part of you own family 

534.17 534.66 A: mhm 

535.11 536.61 B: and so it's nice if you can 

538.23 539.55 B: um get to know 

540.71 541.67 B: family a little and 

541.83 543.19 B: i i think a lot of times it puts 

543.87 547.66 B: puts people in context to see them integrating with their parents or their siblings 

547.70 548.25 A: mhm 

548.71 549.21 B: their pet 

549.32 550.03 B: their 

550.21 552.32 B: what ever their family consists 

552.44 552.77 B: of 

553.00 555.29 A: uh did you get a chance to do that before you got married 

555.46 555.94 B: yeah 

556.50 556.90 B: yeah 

557.98 558.45 B: i did 

559.37 559.87 B: um 

561.40 562.84 B: my husbands 

564.73 565.26 B: i mean not 

565.44 566.68 B: tons and tones of times 

567.08 568.07 B: um i did get some 

568.79 569.61 B: uh visits 

570.44 572.60 B: and about week with his family and then 

574.04 576.33 B: he actually new my brothers very well 

576.52 576.91 A: mhm 

576.83 577.63 B: well fairly well 

583.11 590.16 A: yea we we neither of us we all we all always within you know a couple of hours of either of them 

590.79 592.65 A: so it was so easy to get to know 

592.86 593.88 A: each others families 

594.10 594.93 B: that's really good 

595.00 595.36 A: yeah 

598.79 599.86 A: well i think that's bout it 

601.50 604.29 A: i guess you don't have to stay on the phone the full ten minutes 

604.90 605.38 B: um 

605.51 606.23 B: i don't know 

607.07 607.78 B: the 

608.53 609.88 B: yesterday we 

610.08 611.90 B: actually talked until there was a little 

612.35 615.19 B: beep that came in and said okay now if you want to give feed back 

615.30 616.05 B: give us feed back 

616.15 616.63 A: uh-huh 

617.28 618.45 B: but i don't know how it works 

620.29 620.88 A: oh 

621.22 622.53 B: how did you get um 

623.28 626.01 B: do you know someone at u. penn who's involved in the study or 

626.04 629.30 A: you penn i guess sent an email to one of the professors 

629.88 632.57 A: and that professor sent it out to the laboratory and that professor sent it out to the laboratory 

633.48 635.04 A: so um i thought oh 

635.17 637.56 A: this this is it sounds a little cool 

637.43 637.75 B: yeah 

637.79 638.39 A: so uh 

638.56 639.71 A: i'm give it a try 

640.13 644.36 B: yeah that's how we found my husbands doing a p._h._d. in linguistics at u._s._c. 

644.70 645.15 A: um hum 

644.98 645.33 B: and 

645.88 646.50 B: he also 

648.59 650.20 B: we're familiar with upenn's uh 

651.08 651.45 A: mhm 

653.05 655.15 A: yeah we do information retrieval 

655.62 656.19 B: oh do you 

655.74 657.31 A: um in our lab yes 

657.72 662.73 A: um and i we've done some work in the past in speech recognition and so forth 

663.15 667.48 B: oh i should put you on the line with him cause he'd probably ask you all kinds of questions 

663.43 664.08 A: so 

668.42 669.77 B: you know what he's a researcher at
