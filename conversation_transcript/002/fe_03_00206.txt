322.24 323.20 A: amount of snow 

324.46 325.57 A: probably like twice 

327.38 328.07 B: yeah 

329.00 333.54 B: uh it's nicer like when you hear about other places having lots of snow 

334.23 335.71 B: and you're not there 

338.74 341.97 B: yeah i am lucky i guess now because i am a grad student so i don't have to 

342.85 345.04 B: be anyplace necessarily so 

344.95 345.82 A: oh okay 

346.04 346.48 A: well that's 

346.07 347.89 B: otherwise i would have to uh 

348.43 350.43 B: work in it which wouldn't be fun 

353.83 354.73 B: but it's all okay 

357.11 359.66 A: i know when i was little i used to want to like live 

359.86 361.26 A: in a place with a lot of snow 

361.65 362.30 B: yeah 

362.68 365.15 B: yeah when i was yeah i have um 

365.27 367.21 B: family in pennsylvania so we used to 

367.43 369.10 B: fly out to visit them and 

369.88 372.65 B: like when i was a little kid i really liked the snow but 

373.50 375.15 A: snow fights and snowmen 

374.75 381.89 B: yeah yeah my birthday is in february so like i used to always like hope it would snow because i lived in pennsylvania for a while then too and 

382.56 383.03 B: but then 

383.16 386.61 B: like it would snow on my birthday and no one could come to my birthday party 

387.08 391.26 B: so i think after about three years of this like i stopped wishing for snow

399.44 403.29 B: once i'm done school here i am going to move somewhere more temperate 

403.90 406.71 A: so it's like that bad people like hibernate when it snows 

407.23 408.63 A: and try not to move 

407.27 407.77 B: i don't 

409.05 411.41 B: i don't know like i guess around here 

412.45 413.35 B: yeah i mean 

414.69 416.69 B: i think around here people are a little more 

417.60 420.77 B: careful than like farther north because farther north people aren't 

421.32 423.30 B: much of a wimp but down here i guess i 

423.43 424.33 B: really icy 

424.77 426.56 B: so people try not to go out 

427.01 427.50 A: yeah 

427.17 427.47 B: but 

427.90 430.52 B: (( )) most people have to go to work so there is always people out
