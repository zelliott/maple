143.58 144.68 A: (( i know )) 

145.18 151.79 B: i didn't really even hear about it until after the second plane had uh had hit and i was like 

151.85 160.25 B: [noise] i was in my office and um i got some i got some email from one of my friends it was like the world trade center's on fire and so 

160.59 162.76 B: [lipsmack] i went and uh 

163.02 168.31 B: i tried to like look online like at c. n. n. or something about the the news was 

168.43 179.98 B: and um and i think i think i managed to get the story up it took forever to connect because everybody must have been connecting like trying to read the news or something and um [lipsmack] 

175.67 176.89 A: [noise] 

180.32 190.03 B: and then i i think i just read that there were two planes crashed and that and that the president thought that it was terrorist attack and i was like this can't be i mean this can't be right it must just be an accident or something like that 

189.76 191.26 A: right 

190.13 191.56 B: and then uh 

191.50 201.82 B: and then i went over into the next office and the people there had heard more about it and they had told me about how the um something had crashed into the pentagon 

201.70 215.60 B: and how like the result is panic everywhere and then i was starting to get a little bit [laughter] freaked out and then one of the people that i shared an office with was on the phone with his wife and she was watching the t. v. and she told us when the um 

202.31 203.95 A: yeah 

216.04 226.74 B: [lipsmack] when the towers started to collapse and it was like when i heard that they collapsed that was like sort of when i i don't know it sort of hit me because i had been in new york like 

220.22 221.32 A: (( oh my god )) 

226.78 240.43 B: just a like six months before that at the world trade like i was at a a i was at a conference and it was being held in that marriott hotel that was right there at the world trade center so i was hanging out there for like several days 

233.56 234.65 A: mhm 

237.62 238.64 A: right 

240.33 244.76 B: just a few months before that and i i remember like there was one this one day when we were 

245.11 254.43 B: like right after we got there we went outside and we were right next to the towers you know and we stood you could stand like right next to the base of the tower and look all the way up to the top and i just remember thinking how huge it was you know and everything 

254.37 265.71 B: and then when i heard that they had collapsed you know and that it was like irreversible 'cause i when i when i knew they were on fire and the planes crashed i thought well you know they'll put the fires out and it'll be okay 

265.51 277.40 B: but then when the buildings fell down i was like i don't know it just kinda hit me and then then i was kinda scared 'cause it i live in pittsburgh and they talk about how there was a plane near pittsburgh you know and everything so 

275.08 276.07 A: oh 

278.29 279.15 A: (( yeah )) 

278.31 280.87 B: so yeah it was kinda frightening but 

280.20 287.11 A: yeah i remem- i remember trying to call because i have lots of friends who live in the city and i have a cousin who works like uh 

287.37 290.45 A: i forget who he works for but it was in the world trade center 

290.53 291.94 B: oh really 

290.60 302.05 A: and he he did not go to work because he wasn't feeling well and also had an aunt who worked in the world trade center and she was going late she had taken a half day and was gonna go in late 

299.61 300.60 B: oh 

302.05 302.97 B: wow 

302.30 309.91 A: but you know i didn't know that so i did a first i got on my phone because i i was at my client's office so i always used their phone first so i quickly dialed the phone 

310.16 313.71 A: and i kept getting the all circuits are busy message 

313.96 320.28 A: so i was like you know what i'm gonna try my cell phone so i then get on the cell phone and try and i kept getting the same thing i was like oh 

314.03 314.92 B: uh-huh 

320.24 326.01 A: my god what if my family's there you know i have friends who live like in different parts of the city like they live in the bronx 

325.84 337.50 A: and in queens and in brooklyn and in staten island and stuff but they're in the city all the time so i was like oh my god did they maybe go downtown today who knows like one of my girlfriends is an attorney so she's always downtown for whatever reason 

326.01 326.88 B: yeah 

334.10 334.93 B: yeah 

337.37 338.65 B: right 

338.12 343.28 A: so i was just like oh my god and it just took forever to even get through

349.84 351.35 B: [noise] i actually 

350.02 352.82 A: and like everything closed it was just a pain 

353.09 357.82 B: yeah yeah yeah another thing that kinda freaked me out was that um 

358.21 359.77 B: my sister 

359.92 361.38 B: like um 

361.97 375.35 B: her boyfriend's step-dad was actually on the plane that crashed into the pentagon and so like just having sort of like even though i never met the guy you know i i know my sister's boyfriend but i never met his step-dad or anything like that 

367.44 368.20 A: (( wow )) 

375.06 375.95 A: right 

375.29 379.56 B: but still like having that personal connection to somebody who was like you know

381.79 382.84 A: (( that sucks )) 

382.65 386.19 B: who it who it happened to was kinda it it was pretty scary 

385.11 395.82 A: [noise] you know what the really sucky thing not just the crash themselves but then like every day afterwards where they were just giving all these stories about the various people that were on the planes 

395.76 396.98 B: oh yeah 

396.25 408.75 A: and that just fuck because every channel you turned to was you had another family talking about you know about somebody else that died and they had this one particular story was so horrible it was like these two best friends 

401.90 402.87 B: yeah 

408.96 414.23 A: that had both gotten on each of the one of the planes that were that had crashed into the world trade center 

414.38 415.47 B: (( uh-huh wow )) 

414.44 418.59 A: they were going on vacation separately and they had taken their children with them 

418.83 424.38 A: so they were both headed to california on two different planes and so it so happened that each one of them was on one of those planes 

424.22 425.71 B: oh my gosh 

425.16 437.44 A: and they were each on their well like their first born daughter and they were like you know trying to take trying to go on vacation together with their daughters so their daughters could grow up to be best friends together like they were they were like on their way somewhere to california whatever 

437.53 438.88 B: that's so crazy 

437.66 440.43 A: i was like that sucks [laughter] 

439.97 442.12 B: yeah oh man 

440.60 441.69 A: that just 

441.73 451.78 A: then there was like you know there was a kid like from a bronx public school or something that um like this was his first plane ride ever and he had won some kind of award or something

464.49 465.82 B: (( oh man )) 

465.05 478.50 A: i was like that is so fucked up [laughter] like so bad like i hate saying it like that but it really is like god this really really sucks and it was like you just kept seeing it every single minute of the day 

468.31 470.53 B: (( [laughter] yeah ))

478.62 481.14 A: it's like i'm depressed i can't watch this [laughter] 

482.15 486.49 B: so do you think i thought of one thing like about something to change 

487.53 491.63 B: do you think that you became more patriotic or anything after that happened 

491.32 495.45 A: i definitely did i actually got to a point where i thought about joining the military 

495.39 496.71 B: oh really wow 

496.02 504.06 A: yes i did i as much as i hate the idea of what the military involves but i thought about joining the military but 

503.42 504.27 B: yeah 

503.96 512.51 A: then i decided against it because i i really don't want to dedicate my life like that for this country but i did decide that i am gonna apply to the f. b. i. um 

507.28 508.27 B: yeah 

508.72 509.54 B: yeah 

511.88 513.57 B: oh really oh that's cool 

512.59 516.75 A: yeah i'm graduating from school this year i'm a senior at draxwell university 

516.43 517.33 B: oh 

517.58 526.90 A: i major in computer science and and i'm bilingual so i'm hoping i have a pretty good chance of getting in but yeah i i figure i'd do them when they're like go against terrorism in some kind of way 

526.85 527.97 B: right 

527.37 534.04 A: so uh yeah i did decide i am gonna apply to the f. b. i. or get into kin- some kind of computer security field 

533.62 534.51 B: uh-huh 

534.83 537.72 A: especially the computer forensics that's what i'm really interested in 

538.18 539.30 B: well that's cool 

538.89 539.61 A: (( but )) 

539.39 552.58 A: 'cause i i just feel like that's like a calling like i already i already been interested in law enforcement but once this happened you know and then other things keep happening you know like how they keep finding out how people are laundering money through this country 

545.87 546.68 B: (( mm )) 

548.63 549.48 B: yeah 

552.34 553.20 B: yeah 

552.36 560.19 A: how people are you know getting fake i._d.s and passports and you know they're creating whole fake lives just 'cause they can get in and cause havoc in here 

560.02 561.32 B: right 

560.34 566.81 A: but you know what this is craziness you know people need to step up and do something about this i mean we can only do so much as citizens 

566.97 568.15 B: right 

567.66 577.03 A: so i was like i definitely became more you know patriotic ambassador so that i wanted to help you know protect the country against future attacks and invasions and stuff like that 

574.60 575.53 B: yeah 

577.12 578.14 B: yeah 

577.16 581.72 A: but yeah i got to the point where i was ready to sign up like to go to the navy or something 

581.81 582.61 B: uh-huh 

582.44 586.27 A: i really do and i had a lot of friends that were like that too like friends with families 

586.70 587.61 B: wow 

587.01 597.10 A: they were like yeah you know 'cause i was talking about what a friend i hadn't seen in a few years this past weekend and he was like he has a wife and three kids and he was like you know what i really was about to join the military 

597.05 598.09 B: wow 

597.91 602.78 A: he was like you have no idea he was like 'cause all i kept thinking about was what if they come attack my town 

603.10 604.42 B: yeah 

603.56 611.83 A: or what if they blow up my kids' school or you know a bridge that my wife is riding on or something he was like i'd go crazy i was like man i understand 

610.57 611.38 B: (( yeah it )) 

612.76 613.54 A: but 

612.76 619.45 B: would be a big yeah that'd be like a pretty big sacrifice so if you have a family and like have to go away 

617.56 619.32 A: yeah yeah 

620.29 629.45 A: but i think that's just you know like that's how strongly some people felt about it because this was like as whatever problems you may have with the way this country is run 

629.43 630.37 B: uh-huh 

629.52 636.39 A: because you know a lot of people do you know people don't like the politics they don't like the law they don't like the people making the laws 

633.08 633.98 B: yeah 

636.42 648.66 A: but it's still a great country it has it has a nasty history it has a you know some good parts of its history it has good and nasty people but oh no it's a great it's the best it's the greatest country the world's ever seen 

638.24 639.03 B: yeah 

649.12 656.17 A: i mean at least this world's ever seen so it's like i want us to stay this way as long as possible or at least for my lifetime 

649.18 649.95 B: yeah 

652.12 653.00 B: yeah 

654.85 655.66 B: yeah 

656.58 659.62 B: [laughter] yeah i mean yeah 

657.48 658.97 A: you know like 

658.99 667.04 A: [laughter] basically every great you know empire does meet its end you know but the united states has been going what about four or five hundred years now or whatever 

666.99 674.04 A: and they're still going pretty strong so i mean i i think it will eventually have a downfall like every other great empire but 

667.03 667.79 B: yeah 

674.17 675.70 A: not in our lifetime 

675.60 676.96 B: [laughter] 

676.32 678.38 A: i i would hope not and i you know 

679.28 687.28 A: and when all that stuff happens and then you see like the other news reports about how like you know how bin laden keeps sending these stupid video tapes everywhere 

679.29 680.16 B: yeah 

687.69 688.59 B: right 

687.98 690.03 A: (( i'm like why don't you capture that )) 

690.43 691.47 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

690.84 697.61 A: you know find the guy who's handing over these video tapes and make him tell you i'm sure the u. s. has a way to make people tell them 

697.72 699.13 A: you know [laughter] 

698.01 706.36 B: yeah i don't know where they get those videotapes i mean how do they do they just arrive in the mail or what you know [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

702.69 707.58 A: (( yeah that's what i wanna know i'm just like what the hell's going on [laughter] )) 

707.98 712.05 A: i'm like somebody has to know you know somebody has to know what the common link is 

712.05 719.89 B: yeah yeah so maybe it's like if they got spies or something you know they can't i don't know i don't know 

714.11 714.69 A: (( so ))
