40.81 42.14 A: um 

42.66 45.40 A: but i guess yeah it's a nice time of the year 

46.77 50.34 A: i like how everything lights up it's always nice 

50.57 51.26 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

52.42 56.70 A: see i really like um passover actually 

57.45 60.38 A: do you know anything do you know anything about that 

59.79 62.05 B: (( yes well that's really you know i l- )) 

62.31 65.19 B: i love christmas more so for the meaning of christmas too 

65.07 66.58 A: right 

65.98 69.25 B: so i think we could identify on that level [laughter] 

68.84 73.49 A: yeah i definitely think so but what i really like about passover is um th- 

74.50 79.99 A: there's a lot of tradition surrounding it and then there's a lot of tradition um family tradition 

80.48 81.56 A: (( and )) 

83.27 87.12 A: all of that's really important to me i like the idea of 

86.42 87.02 B: (( mhm )) 

87.18 87.75 B: (( [noise] )) 

87.33 91.83 A: do- doing the same thing every year with my family and having us all gathered together 

91.41 91.99 B: (( [noise] )) 

92.16 92.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

92.39 94.62 A: in one place for something 

94.18 95.53 B: (( mhm )) 

95.43 97.40 A: (( i j- yeah [noise] )) 

97.69 99.49 A: that um 

100.69 103.04 A: that's really nice for me personally 

102.92 103.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

104.32 106.75 A: to be able to do that 

108.79 109.74 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

110.08 112.80 A: did he say something about creating a holiday 

112.71 114.11 B: yeah [laughter] 

113.87 114.77 A: oy 

115.46 116.33 B: [laughter] 

115.82 117.45 A: okay 

118.92 122.58 A: um i'm not so much into that [laughter] 

122.74 131.42 B: i like the idea but i think [laughter] i think the holiday should be like thanksgiving a sort of thanksgiving every day so people are like aware of 

131.61 135.05 B: of others rather than just aware of themselves [laughter] 

134.14 140.09 A: [noise] yeah but at the same time if you extend something to have it every day 

140.30 142.98 A: then it sort of loses its meaning 

143.60 154.43 B: no but that's exactly why it would be terrific because then people wouldn't think it has to be like that there has to be a certain set of behaviors on one given day 

153.87 155.38 A: every day is earth day 

155.43 158.47 B: that every day is is a day to give thanks 

158.49 159.71 A: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

159.08 160.69 B: to appreciate what you have 

163.25 164.56 B: (( and what you get )) 

163.33 164.36 A: yeah 

167.88 170.36 A: that's true that would be nice [noise] but 

173.37 175.66 A: i'm not sure if we could 

176.51 182.91 A: [noise] i don't know if people would then just sort of forget all about it because they wouldn't 

187.24 199.32 A: [lipsmack] i don't know i think that holidays aren't limited to only the holiday because there's always time beforehand and time afterward when it's on everyone's mind 

199.05 211.84 B: oh i think everyone should have to be like working in a soup kitchen or like freezing outside for [laughter] like a day or a night and to understand like be like some people might need more severe examples of 

211.79 214.25 A: yeah that's true i mean 

213.63 215.58 B: there's it's actually the 

215.61 216.71 A: i really 

215.79 218.78 B: i'm getting i'm getting another call from the same 

219.03 220.63 A: how bizarre 

220.03 221.73 B: thing yeah it's been calling me 

222.16 225.77 B: a million times every night it's driving me absolutely nuts [laughter] yeah [laughter] mm 

224.91 229.10 A: yeah it's b- it's just been once a night for me every weeknight 

228.92 229.91 B: (( mhm right mhm right )) 

229.29 230.40 A: but um 

230.52 231.55 A: yeah that's 

232.14 237.47 A: um yom kippur is actually the holiest day on the on the calendar 

237.71 238.30 B: (( mhm )) 

238.18 245.60 A: [mn] and it's sort of a day to to think about how you're gonna change the way you live 

245.79 249.34 A: for the next year it comes a week after the jewish new year 

249.59 250.72 A: um 

250.86 258.00 A: and but one of the things that you do is that you don't eat or drink from sundown to sundown 

259.11 260.33 A: so 

261.10 265.04 A: it's all about remembering what it's like to be really hungry 

267.11 271.74 B: well i mean so you were saying that right you were saying you may not feel that identifies 

267.48 269.37 A: which i guess is the same thing 

269.42 272.42 A: although it doesn't it doesn't help other people 

271.79 286.20 B: that's the same but i think you were thinking that maybe jewish traditions really start from christian tradition even though like the first christians were jewish and the whole idea of lent is the same thing when people do stuff like that or or holy days 

283.60 285.61 A: oh right well no i'm i'm not 

285.78 291.18 A: i'm not i'm not saying that they're different i was just saying that i think there are some holidays 

291.13 301.89 A: it's not quite like making people work in a soup kitchen but it is making people think about what it would be like to be live to be someone who had to go to soup kitchens 

295.35 296.35 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

298.36 299.06 B: (( sure [noise] )) 

302.90 303.99 A: (( [noise] um )) 

304.35 311.02 A: no yeah and i know that that you know you don't eat meat for lent and all sorts of other things 

308.21 309.19 B: [laughter] 

311.17 313.91 A: for a much longer period um yeah 

316.08 318.62 B: [noise] [noise] 

318.39 322.12 A: so you like holidays where the idea is 

322.47 323.65 A: to 

324.07 328.11 A: get people thinking about a larger world mhm 

327.55 329.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

330.51 336.64 A: um do you think there are any holidays that can be for personal introspection 

337.14 339.29 B: (( i think every day i think )) 

339.51 342.77 B: but i think i've come to realize that that's also 

342.91 348.37 B: i guess not everybody has that inner awareness so we can't necessarily expect 

348.89 350.53 B: everybody to really 

350.78 353.74 B: be the people who have the inner awareness [laughter] 

353.07 363.78 A: mhm right but [cough] but i mean there are days when you say okay everybody you know take a day and really think about where you fit into the world 

364.31 372.91 A: but then i think that there are other types of holidays that say take a d- um take a day or a week or whatever and really think about 

372.86 373.55 B: (( so )) 

375.77 379.00 A: [noise] what you're like as a person right now 

377.85 378.56 B: [noise] 

378.89 379.49 B: [noise] 

380.24 383.51 A: because i think that that's something that people don't do all too often 

383.25 390.02 B: [noise] [noise] yeah but i think the way holidays are at least in the u. s. like they're not so extended that people have like 

390.85 395.86 B: i don't know i mean i don't even know if americans were given a long period of time whether they would 

396.03 397.42 B: delve deep enough 

397.46 404.43 B: like into that kind of stuff like i think [mn] i think sometimes you need a lot of time and you need to get away from whatever you're doing 

404.82 407.75 B: and the routine like the european idea of holidays 

408.11 409.62 A: right 

408.29 413.95 B: (( much much more like that where you like have six weeks to like vanish and do something totally different )) 

413.96 419.41 A: yeah i'm not so fond of the going and lying on a beach 

419.32 420.63 B: (( no me neither [laughter] )) 

419.87 421.45 A: type of vacation 

422.36 425.64 A: you know [noise] it's just sort of changing gears 

425.95 432.89 A: um you don't stop working you just work at something different and give whatever part of your mind you've been 

429.82 430.93 B: yeah 

433.77 436.00 A: using too much a break 

437.68 438.82 B: (( mhm )) 

438.87 441.97 B: [noise] so are you working for this study at penn mhm 

442.03 445.55 A: um yeah oh uh working for them 

444.97 446.82 B: uh are you on some 

447.35 450.07 B: [noise] are you part of the study at university of pennsylvania [noise] 

449.63 452.23 A: yeah yeah i'm just another subject 

451.68 453.42 B: [noise] 

452.81 454.57 A: (( um [cough] )) 

455.75 457.89 A: yeah 

457.51 458.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

458.75 461.15 A: [cough] sorry i have something caught in my throat [sigh]

471.48 474.27 B: no that's what i was wondering okay [laughter] [noise] 

472.58 473.49 A: yeah 

473.57 474.49 A: no 

474.62 478.37 B: oh i'm getting another call from this line it's crazy they're 

477.54 478.25 A: that 

478.77 482.06 B: it's just really neurotic i don't think they realize it's 

479.41 481.08 A: (( well that's )) 

481.76 484.52 A: bizarre no i haven't had that happen to me yet 

484.49 485.64 B: [laughter] 

485.19 488.53 A: but so do you think holidays are different elsewhere 

489.74 496.75 B: well i i mean i work with a lot of europeans and i tend to think that europeans actually take more time to really think about 

497.05 498.99 B: their place in the world and like 

499.49 502.22 B: 'cause there's always that inner awareness and 

502.72 503.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

503.56 504.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

503.93 508.66 B: (( i don't know if it has something to do with how society is structured outside of the u. s. )) 

507.36 508.94 A: (( mhm )) 

511.18 513.26 A: have you spent time living overseas 

514.02 517.42 B: (( no i've traveled a lot but i haven't really lived overseas hm )) 

517.29 518.25 A: uh-huh 

519.50 521.97 A: so what do you think about stuff like halloween 

522.59 528.81 B: [noise] i don't like halloween [laughter] to me it's evil you know the whole premise behind halloween [laughter] 

524.56 525.41 A: no 

528.88 532.07 A: uh i've heard lots of different stories what's yours 

532.64 534.71 B: well there are actually like still like 

534.86 536.56 B: well first of all it's like 

536.58 541.45 B: it follows all saints day which is like one of the holiest days [laughter] 

538.74 539.65 A: right 

541.29 543.06 A: right 

542.19 544.74 B: in christian life and uh 

545.24 557.12 B: like people so there's still cults that like sacrifice it's actually still the day with the most sacrifices of babies and like of human beings like all year round and i think it's totally disgusting [laughter] 

557.00 559.15 A: yeah 

557.18 557.88 B: (( [mn] )) 

559.45 562.38 A: but as okay as an american phenomenon 

564.87 565.72 B: well 

565.77 568.09 B: sad to say but you know 

568.39 570.56 B: the whole world is sorta structured 

570.98 583.92 B: on like premises of fear because of all the people who do odd things and because there are people like out there who actually might like hurt children or like put things in their candy or whatnot like i think i mean all that stuff just 

583.94 586.12 B: places a lot of fear in people's 

586.50 587.08 A: (( mhm )) 

586.85 588.06 B: (( hearts and minds )) 

589.12 591.58 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

591.62 593.30 A: i've also 

593.61 598.37 A: a- another origin story and i'm not sure how credible this is 

598.46 608.40 A: um as i recall it was from a pretty credible source was that um the tradition of trick or treating particularly was um 

608.79 611.91 A: [mn] that the day after all saints day 

612.00 614.51 A: uh the lords would go out 

614.56 615.86 A: and 

616.47 618.29 A: um give 

618.93 620.14 A: gifts 

620.36 621.44 A: to 

621.69 626.23 A: their um serfs to help them get through the winter 

626.14 626.77 B: (( uh-huh )) 

626.98 628.39 A: that was approaching 

629.30 630.26 B: (( interesting )) 

630.13 633.96 A: yeah uh i'm just trying to think 

635.40 647.92 A: and i think that that that's part of maybe the idea that you know holidays are given a specific day but the spirit of whatever particular holiday sort of pervades the weeks 

638.83 639.65 B: [noise] 

639.79 640.66 B: [noise] 

646.58 650.63 B: yeah well that's what bugs me about halloween though is that like there actually are like 

648.54 649.83 A: the weeks become 

651.02 663.13 B: [noise] a lot of devil worshippers out there like that still exist like i have a friend who teaches at a junior high school where i live and his students like in junior high school whose parents are training them to worship the devil i mean this doesn't sit well with me [laughter] 

660.59 661.61 A: (( [laughter] )) 

663.75 665.75 A: well do they do anything wrong mhm 

665.63 673.15 B: yeah well they like bury things like in the school yard because i don't know they think they hold like all these weird superstitions about like 

673.64 676.54 B: (( i don't know things that are good versus evil and )) 

676.63 680.95 B: that aren't based on any sound [laughter] sense [laughter] 

681.98 682.80 B: so 

685.48 686.68 B: (( [noise] so )) 

687.96 689.23 A: (( [noise] hm that's right )) 

688.63 691.61 B: what are we supposed to be doing on these phone calls i have no idea 

690.87 693.13 A: we just talk about holidays 

692.94 694.51 B: and people are recording us 

694.33 695.31 A: yes 

695.10 696.58 B: [laughter] 

695.96 698.03 A: i uh the last one i 

698.16 706.29 A: did was arms inspections in iraq and it was considerably more heated this is this is sort of more laid back i think 

701.39 702.08 B: huh 

703.06 704.39 B: uh-huh well 

705.95 706.85 B: (( yeah ))
