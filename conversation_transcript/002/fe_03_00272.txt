128.21 129.44 A: oh okay 

129.11 134.51 B: yeah i was really interesting went to see how it happened and what happened to it [noise] 

131.46 132.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

134.06 137.96 A: yeah oh okay and when did you first hear about it 

137.85 143.17 B: um i was at school and and we our class just got cancelled 

143.26 147.59 B: [mn] and home and so because they were um closed all of 

148.21 152.73 B: air force base and so they sent everyone home in case something happened 

152.62 153.94 A: yeah 

153.69 159.71 B: and so um yeah and i went home and my roommate and i watched it but after the bay on t._v. 

159.32 160.31 A: (( yeah yes )) 

160.61 164.67 B: and so were you at work or at school or 

161.27 162.44 A: this is uh 

164.19 171.31 A: yeah yeah uh we work we were actually on the street and uh when we heard about it 

171.62 179.13 A: um we just rushed to home and uh we were actually exactly in the street going to a doctor for a doctor visit 

179.48 189.71 A: and in the doctor it was very crowded and very there because they uh they want to finish everybody and send everybody home so 

179.61 180.68 B: oh 

189.81 198.47 A: uh it was really a very terrible and everybody was scared and nobody is uh can figure out what's happening yeah 

197.87 198.75 B: right 

199.68 200.97 B: (( i'm sorry )) 

200.40 204.34 A: so do you consider it ah ah like tourism 

204.36 207.95 B: oh yes definitely what about you [noise] 

207.27 211.16 A: yeah yeah yeah definitely and it's 

211.24 211.80 A: (( [cough] )) 

212.09 223.29 A: i didn't know though what the meaning of terrorism until this moment you know until the september eleventh so uh it's it's uh it's 

223.58 230.65 A: i've i think many people after september eleven uh know and figure out what the meaning of terrorism 

230.40 231.74 B: mhm 

231.07 239.41 A: yeah exactly before september eleventh there was lots of confusion about uh the meaning and the definition of terrorism 

233.12 233.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

240.37 242.87 B: yes and so what's your definition 

242.73 243.98 A: yeah 

244.13 245.33 B: what is it 

245.04 254.48 A: uh uh i mean uh in general before september eleven many people had uh problems with the definition of september eleven 

251.62 254.04 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

254.59 262.43 A: or what exactly september eleven but after after september eleven many people uh learn 

262.45 264.84 A: (( what is uh terrorism )) 

265.19 266.38 B: yes 

265.94 268.43 A: yeah this is the the point 

268.05 279.01 B: yeah it is and i don't really what it is 'cause i never really experienced it or feel it and well actually i take that back i live in oklahoma so um we had a bombing here 

278.81 282.04 A: oh oh okay in oklahoma city mhm 

281.24 287.73 B: yes yes and so i was like by there and so i was like how did it affect me but y- it was a 

288.23 300.01 B: you know it was within the nation and i it wasn't as scary just thinking of it one one little group of people had something out against us that's not too scary but when a whole country you know 

291.01 292.27 A: yeah 

293.55 295.30 A: yeah that's back in 

299.69 301.93 A: yeah yeah yeah 

300.45 308.20 B: has something against you it's kinda frightening and so it hit me really big there was a really big difference between what happened in oklahoma and in new york city 

308.37 309.33 A: yeah 

308.47 315.69 B: and so like new york i mean i knew people in the oklahoma city bombing but it was not as big 

315.80 317.08 A: yeah yeah 

316.13 317.80 B: as in new york city 

317.59 320.52 A: yeah even though it's very big in new york city 

320.73 324.25 A: uh the bombing in new york city was really very big one 

324.32 325.58 B: yes 

325.19 335.69 A: yeah but uh it it didn't take you know that uh much uh attention from the people and that much attention from the media like as comparison 

335.32 336.40 B: yeah 

336.43 339.14 B: yeah and i don't know like i think that 

339.13 351.76 B: people learned more from the september eleventh you know like they became more aware of terrorism and they became more cautious and security got tighter and i think it was a good lesson you know on terrorism 

350.20 351.01 A: yeah 

351.36 352.70 A: exactly 

352.76 367.10 A: uh yes exactly uh maybe uh people and or people of oklahoma city is more trained on terrorism than yeah and now i think people of new york city as much more trained on terrorism 

360.48 361.55 B: mhm 

366.96 368.10 B: yes 

367.43 380.46 A: so this is one of the advantages or one of the good features of terrorism is it makes the people more prepared and more trained on how to handle the terrorism and how to prevent it before it occurs 

380.11 381.52 B: right 

381.69 384.74 B: and so i agree with that totally 

384.17 385.03 A: (( yes )) 

385.72 388.26 B: so as scary as it was we were 

386.59 387.41 A: and 

388.57 402.63 A: yeah and i think now our country is much more prepared and much more um uh trained on this and people are more prepared and more aware of terrorism so now i think there's uh 

403.24 406.90 A: less likely that another terrorism act will occur 

406.94 408.43 B: do you think so 

408.38 415.37 A: yes because now they are much more standard and major stake and to prevent and 

413.73 414.81 B: mhm 

415.38 417.74 A: to avoid uh terrorism 

417.63 429.02 B: [mn] right and so yes i think we'll be much better prepared for it next time around and that um not that that's a good thing necessarily but we have to learn the hard way but 

428.99 429.83 A: yeah 

429.39 431.98 B: at least we'll be prepared [laughter] if it happens again 

433.98 436.22 B: and so [laughter] 

434.80 436.16 A: (( yeah yeah okay )) 

437.97 442.20 B: do you have any other questions i can't really think of anything else 

441.60 442.91 A: (( ah no )) 

443.06 444.27 A: how 'bout you 

444.38 447.54 B: um no not really 

446.97 448.41 A: oh okay 

448.43 449.52 A: all right 

449.85 453.30 B: it's uh well don't we have to wait 'til it tells us to 

453.60 456.43 B: you know our time is up the recording has stopped 

456.86 458.95 A: oh so we have to wait until 

458.76 463.00 B: yeah it tells you it's like [sigh] ten minutes or something do you know how long we've been talking 

463.56 467.06 A: uh actually i think it's less than ten minutes 

466.92 468.18 B: oh really 

467.83 469.86 A: so yeah yeah 

469.02 473.15 B: okay i i get nervous so yesterday but 

472.22 472.98 A: (( yeah )) 

473.03 485.60 A: so i think another point here is that um the september eleven what makes it uh so big is that uh there are actually four accidents at the same time it's not just one 

485.37 487.08 B: right 

487.35 491.71 A: it's uh world trade center and you know the pentagon 

491.94 493.68 A: yeah and uh 

493.79 500.86 A: ah the other two uh places so uh [cough] so that's why it and they all at the same time 

500.67 502.52 B: yeah [noise] 

501.48 509.87 A: and uh they all all of a sudden so nobody have sort of a i mean for a long time you know since oklahoma city there was 

509.33 512.28 B: [noise] 

513.15 513.99 A: hello 

513.95 515.69 B: are you there 

515.08 516.12 A: yes 

515.98 522.16 B: oh i'm sorry my phone cut out [cough] and so i couldn't hear you for a second 

521.56 530.81 A: yes um i think the reas- the main reason i either mentioned or one of the reasons why september eleven is so big because um 

530.76 537.84 A: there are four uh accidents or four incidents at the same time this is one thing the other thing is that 

537.92 543.19 A: uh we didn't have that big terrorism for a long time you know since uh 

542.46 544.08 B: mhm 

543.29 555.31 A: yeah since oklahoma city uh we didn't have that much terrorism or that much accident ex- except some ah school shooting here and there only very small 

555.10 565.19 A: but uh like all of a sudden we have this big accident in four places that's was a shock for everyone 

558.97 559.57 B: (( [cough] )) 

560.52 562.57 B: mhm 

565.46 566.41 B: yes 

567.02 569.53 B: and so it got this trail 

569.83 571.45 A: yeah 

573.00 575.92 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

575.20 584.73 A: so uh why do you think that do you think that september eleven has uh uh taken a much more attention than it deserve or 

585.41 589.21 B: oh definitely yeah and so do you 

589.21 590.76 A: (( yes yes )) 

590.69 592.52 B: why do you think that 

592.30 606.06 A: uh because actually um it seems that it's ah it's like a world war you know like world war i._i. or world war war so all that attention is uh it's a big event it's 

602.40 603.43 B: mhm 

605.29 610.07 B: yeah that's true 

606.65 607.68 A: very big 

610.28 612.71 B: (( and it shouldn't have been that big )) 

612.35 613.44 A: yeah 

613.93 617.50 B: mhm they got too much attention from it 

616.49 623.99 A: yeah yeah uh let me ask you are you sure that we have to wait until uh the robot prompts us to 

623.97 628.50 B: yeah yeah and so it'll say 

624.42 625.35 A: hang up 

629.35 633.47 B: and so i don't know when maybe not it sounds like it's been longer 

633.67 638.40 A: yeah so it this your first time doing this uh study 

637.80 640.98 B: no it's my second 

640.20 641.92 A: oh oh so you uh 

642.56 643.98 A: (( okay yeah )) 

644.83 648.90 B: and so i don't i don't know where it should have said that already 

649.22 653.49 A: yeah i think now we are uh over ten minutes 

653.20 654.54 B: oh okay 

654.87 659.04 B: and so about time so uh it this was interesting 

658.80 660.04 A: yeah 

661.06 661.70 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

662.46 663.06 B: (( mm )) 

662.72 665.70 A: so uh we have to wait until uh 

666.50 669.91 A: we get the uh signal from 

670.13 672.27 B: um i guess not 

672.90 675.91 B: and so i thought so but it's been a long time 

675.83 677.99 A: uh oh okay a long time 

678.13 682.49 B: i don't know and so we don't have to and so we can end it 

683.42 688.98 A: eh but uh you haven't participated in this uh particular study in this fisher study 

688.86 689.97 B: no 

689.72 691.64 A: it's first time 

691.05 692.30 B: yes 

691.71 697.19 A: okay because i didn't read anywhere that we have to 

697.16 698.42 B: oh okay 

697.59 701.36 A: continue so i can maybe we have we can hang up 

700.98 702.34 B: okay that's fine 

702.27 703.22 A: okay
