40.70 41.43 A: um 

41.86 43.15 A: but that i don't think that will 

43.82 48.59 A: change my mind i mean i really want to fly but so so that hasn't 

48.78 50.57 A: effected anything and 

50.67 52.99 A: but it's just that i have become more aware i guess 

53.91 54.90 B: aware of what 

55.22 56.13 A: aware of 

56.42 57.09 A: um 

58.76 60.93 A: like the news and um 

62.23 65.15 A: what could go on i guess uh that's all

77.59 78.96 B: nowhere chile 

79.11 79.84 A: oh 

79.89 82.06 B: so it was like you totally

86.55 87.06 A: mhm 

87.11 88.79 B: but i remember at the time i was like 

89.52 93.67 B: you know close to i hadn't decided i was going to move back to the states and um 

95.25 101.03 B: and then everyone was like oh my god you can't move back to the united states now because your country is in chaos and 

101.15 105.79 B: and then i was like well this really does kind of suck actually it is kind of really bad timing 

105.31 106.51 A: yeah yeah 

106.88 107.75 B: but um 

106.90 107.41 A: um

130.09 130.96 B: it was 

132.54 135.54 B: it was kind of 

135.75 147.58 B: cold actually it was too cold where i was living and i was just like uh ah you know i'm not making like that great of a salary and there is no chance of like advanced 

137.86 138.29 A: yeah

173.30 173.76 A: yeah

177.71 179.33 B: i don't know engineering majors 

179.81 180.65 B: which was cool 

181.01 181.46 A: mhm 

181.45 182.17 B: but um 

183.67 186.12 B: but yeah i just sort of decided that it was time to sort of 

188.80 192.71 B: advance which i didn't see any chance for where i was living at the time so 

193.35 193.82 A: mhm 

193.37 195.76 B: so i decided to move back to the united states and 

196.47 198.62 B: and then september eleventh happened and 

200.29 201.79 B: and that was a very 

203.20 204.31 B: that certainly 

204.41 206.97 B: made my decision to go back to the states less 

207.58 208.25 B: logical 

209.09 210.18 A: yeah yeah 

210.42 216.16 B: everyone was like are you absolutely out of your mind in chile we have no problem no one will ever bomb us 

213.50 214.09 A: mhm 

216.49 217.01 A: mhm 

217.16 218.49 B: just true uh because they won't 

220.27 220.77 B: but 

220.89 221.96 A: yeah yeah 

222.10 223.29 B: well what were you doing that 

223.71 229.08 B: i mean like like what was the day like i mean how did you uh first see the news for example 

229.99 231.24 A: um i was 

232.03 232.42 A: um 

232.83 235.91 A: actually i decided to come back to school and it was like 

237.11 238.81 A: a couple of weeks before um 

239.26 239.79 A: and 

240.26 240.66 A: i was 

241.52 243.24 A: um going to a job interview 

243.62 244.56 A: i really didn't 

244.95 248.18 A: know what was happening i mean i just heard it on m._p._r. 

248.64 249.14 B: mhm 

248.83 249.94 A: and um 

251.28 254.66 A: i guess and then on every other radio news channel in my car and 

255.38 257.69 A: i guess it was a big deal and so it was just 

258.80 259.25 A: um 

259.37 261.18 A: i guess that whole day was kind of 

261.31 262.44 A: put on pa- like 

263.09 263.62 A: i don't know 

263.12 263.61 B: yeah 

264.08 266.54 A: everybody was just kind of glued to the news 

266.93 267.28 A: so 

267.86 268.98 A: it was really weird 

269.70 270.79 A: at first i thought it was 

272.15 272.77 A: you know 

272.97 275.05 A: not really happening or i don't know 

274.69 275.56 B: yeah 

275.65 277.84 A: it was just huh i don't know 

278.29 279.12 A: but it did 

280.26 283.20 B: were you living in a big city or a small town or 

282.92 285.10 A: yes i uh i live in columbus 

286.30 287.18 B: columbus ohio 

286.33 286.68 A: so 

287.27 287.73 A: mhm 

288.51 290.24 A: um it's not that big but you know 

288.70 289.57 B: mhm 

291.47 291.99 B: right 

292.15 293.20 B: not that small either 

292.35 292.79 A: (( )) 

293.55 293.95 A: yeah 

294.11 299.71 B: yeah we were thinking about my where i was working was like we were in the write english building 

299.97 305.63 B: and they had decided that they were going to create this english atmosphere by always playing c._n._n. in the hallways 

306.56 308.53 B: and so the day that 

308.68 310.73 B: the september eleventh thing happened 

311.29 312.94 B: everybody on campus 

313.05 314.09 B: sat in our 

313.07 313.49 A: mhm 

314.35 315.07 B: hallway 

315.64 320.04 B: to watch c._n._n. and to watch like the towers exploding and stuff 

320.23 321.44 B: and it was this sort of 

321.71 322.78 B: bizarre 

321.73 322.55 A: in chile 

323.18 323.79 B: yeah 

324.17 325.00 A: wow 

324.65 325.21 B: yeah 

325.32 329.56 B: -cause like i mean people were on campus and like the campus i was working at too was kind of like 

330.23 334.89 B: outside of town so it wasn't like people could easily hop home or anything like that 

335.28 335.81 A: mhm 

335.51 337.34 B: so they were all sitting in our hallway 

337.60 339.56 B: but listening to the c._n._n. 

340.20 343.63 B: in english that was kind of like the deal they had to listen to it in english 

343.94 344.39 A: mhm 

344.28 346.91 B: and so they were blasting english you know it's 

347.46 354.88 B: but you know like i don't know when you don't understand a language very well you sort of like turn up the volume you know plus there were more people and everything so 

354.36 354.79 A: yeah 

355.01 357.48 B: blasting in the hallway and i was just like 

358.51 364.98 B: i don't know it was one of these things where like i just wanted sit and do the job that i had to teach them classes that day and i like 

365.73 370.27 B: they weren't going to call those off in chile you know and so i had to like go and do them anyway 

368.59 369.05 A: mhm 

370.51 372.27 B: so what i really wanted to do was like 

372.68 377.37 B: just prepare for them and not listen to every single detail about the tragedy because like 

378.71 380.38 B: i wasn't really sure that i could deal with it 

380.61 382.09 B: and um i thought well 

380.75 381.39 A: yeah 

382.35 383.15 B: just tell me what 

383.45 387.18 B: the sort of sum of the thing is at the end of the day you know 

387.46 388.89 B: and don't tell me every 

389.62 397.99 B: every like i'm in shock and this person is in shock and we are all in shock and you know like i was just like ah turn down the volume but 

394.20 395.26 A: yeah yeah 

398.10 403.06 B: like in my office we couldn't close the door either so there was no way to sort of 

403.24 405.55 B: drown it out it was just this blasting 

406.43 407.22 B: c._n._n. 

407.38 408.00 A: mhm 

408.92 409.69 A: wow 

409.72 412.93 B: so and then to add on it okay 

413.25 417.57 B: september eleventh in chile also happens to be the day that pinochet's 

417.80 419.81 B: group or the c._i._a. or whatever 

419.89 420.20 A: who 

420.40 422.31 B: um raided the 

422.57 430.09 B: essentially white house of chile and uh killed a (( )) back in nineteen seventy three so it is this day of protest 

430.27 432.47 B: and everything and remembering the coup 

433.38 434.90 B: in that country so it's just this 

435.13 437.51 B: dark day you know 

436.93 437.93 A: yeah 

437.73 439.94 B: so it was just like oh god 

440.16 441.24 A: oh my gosh 

441.10 445.22 B: that seems like a bad day you know a bad day 

445.80 448.62 A: yeah nine eleven nine one one 

448.36 449.34 B: yeah true 

449.48 450.16 B: very weird 

449.53 449.97 A: so 

450.67 451.15 A: uh 

452.11 452.84 A: man 

454.23 454.81 B: yeah 

455.86 456.99 A: but um 

457.29 460.58 A: has it changed you like habit or i mean 

461.56 464.50 A: flying or i mean like how has it changed 

466.20 468.83 B: god what has it changed i know that like 

469.92 471.88 B: i've taken many planes actually since then 

472.10 472.54 A: mhm 

472.14 473.99 B: many more than normal actually 

474.18 474.57 A: mhm 

474.36 480.02 B: and uh i mean it's always this big old hassle and then the weird thing is that um 

482.19 486.52 B: it's never been too big of a hassle for me sometimes a little bit of one but whatever 

487.40 488.38 B: but um 

488.76 491.19 B: it seems to be a bigger hassle for 

491.78 492.67 B: for example 

492.99 494.43 B: me i look kind of like 

495.03 498.22 B: absolutely neutral i guess my sister for example looks 

498.77 503.63 B: more wholesome and more blonde and more white than i do and she has had more problems 

504.14 505.94 B: in terms of security than i have 

506.73 512.55 B: and like my boyfriend looks very chilean and sort of dark skinned and you know not american 

512.64 513.03 A: yes 

513.15 516.40 B: and i was traveling with him and he had way more problems but 

516.81 523.38 B: me i'm kind of like riding in the middle line and no one really suspects me of anything until 

516.94 517.38 A: uh-huh 

523.99 525.07 B: in traveling it
