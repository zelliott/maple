29.53 30.71 B: (( yeah )) 

31.77 33.02 B: uh-huh 

32.77 38.26 A: yeah so what's the topic for today it's like life partner 

37.05 38.02 B: (( life )) 

38.17 44.49 B: partners so so it's how we feel or what's the most important thing 

39.06 40.34 A: right 

44.26 45.31 A: mhm 

44.60 46.93 B: in a life partner i guess 

46.43 48.99 A: yeah well 

49.27 55.72 A: mm if i have to pick a quality i guess i would say um he must be caring 

55.97 57.04 B: mhm 

56.93 58.10 A: (( uh )) 

58.48 66.50 A: since like it's a life partner i guess that caring is pretty important at least to me uh what about you 

67.06 70.51 B: oh um well i think that um 

71.09 72.76 B: i think the most 

72.93 78.89 B: that would be really hard to say the most important but one of the most important things would be um 

79.38 81.99 B: for someone to be very understanding 

81.57 82.87 A: (( yes )) 

82.51 86.84 B: and um just to have really great communication 

86.69 87.83 A: mhm 

87.19 92.19 B: between the two of you know i mean that's kind of like something that 

92.29 100.53 B: each partner means but you know someone who is understanding knows that patience is really important 

96.45 97.46 A: (( mhm )) 

98.42 99.74 A: yeah 

101.05 102.05 B: so 

102.06 103.95 A: yeah 

102.15 102.98 B: (( i think )) 

103.54 105.13 B: think that 

104.87 105.71 A: yeah 

106.03 119.44 A: this mor- i mean like when i think about it sometimes i must think if my partner has the same interests with me would be good since we can do things together i mean the things we still interested together 

119.27 120.22 B: right 

119.49 130.36 A: and but then like it seems like if he he has like that that person has some some other interests it would be also fun that i could try new things so 

129.58 131.00 B: (( right mhm )) 

130.36 139.07 A: so that that makes me feel like that's not going to be the most important so yeah mm 

139.53 143.18 B: and so you said the most important thing would be if they're 

143.25 148.20 A: caring just kinda like understanding caring that kinda thing 

148.33 149.59 B: mhm 

149.62 151.59 B: (( yeah that's very important )) 

151.88 154.72 B: care for you when you need it 

155.07 166.52 A: [laughter] yeah i think because of the phase of question like life partner i don't think anyone will ever really pick like appearances do you think so [laughter] 

155.16 156.18 B: (( i know )) 

166.53 168.43 B: oh i would hope not 

167.75 169.50 A: (( [laughter] yeah i mean )) 

168.71 174.84 B: i mean that that's a pretty big plus but it's not the most important 

171.22 173.06 A: i know [laughter] 

174.97 177.45 A: well true yeah 

175.48 176.16 B: (( really )) 

177.40 185.20 B: i wouldn't imagine a life partner would last for a lifetime if it was based on just looks you know [laughter] 

183.85 187.38 A: i know [laughter] true 

187.59 188.67 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

188.13 188.98 A: [sigh] 

190.08 191.14 A: (( well )) 

191.50 197.36 A: what else i mean do you think we can pick another one or just one thing one most important thing 

196.84 201.69 B: i don't know this is the first one that i have actually gotten to do have 

201.02 202.78 A: oh yeah 

201.99 203.22 B: you done more 

203.05 217.06 A: no i just try one i think yesterday or the day before i'm not su- i don't remember because like the oth- the other day like they asked me like a very weird question i don't even know what to say so i didn't do it [laughter] basically i think they mentioned something like 

213.26 214.93 B: [laughter] 

217.04 224.12 A: you rock or something so i was like no i don't know that topic so i don't want to do it [laughter] [laughter] yeah

224.21 226.56 A: it was stressful [laughter] 

226.13 228.01 B: [laughter] 

227.16 228.70 A: [sigh] uh 

229.67 240.22 B: yeah i think like marriages in general nowadays are just like people give up too easy because it's it is really easy to say it's not working let's just 

240.04 241.48 A: (( i know )) 

240.85 241.92 B: (( stop )) 

242.30 246.17 B: you know but i mean like my parents are divorced but

248.81 251.24 B: (( for myself obviously )) 

248.82 249.81 A: (( uh-huh )) 

250.41 255.89 A: yeah of course i mean true well i guess like finding a really like 

256.11 264.39 A: like a partner that you would like to spend your whole life with with him it's tough [laughter] it's no easy task 

265.13 270.29 B: yes i know like i have i'm actually engaged right now but i 

269.32 271.76 A: (( oh nice )) 

271.16 281.71 B: have like a lot of friends who who are still you know they're my age and they're dating and um i never really got to do the whole dating thing you 

276.72 277.71 A: uh-huh 

281.09 282.35 A: (( mhm )) 

281.75 290.88 B: know uh just because of the schools i went to and stuff it was just kind of it wasn't like officially going out and going and like finding me a guy or not but um 

288.62 289.68 A: uh-huh 

290.63 291.59 A: uh-huh 

290.95 296.97 B: they're just really sick of it you know they're like i just want to find the one but i was saying like 

295.12 296.14 A: [laughter] 

297.04 309.74 B: you know i found my fiance with when i stopped looking i was like okay i don't want a boyfriend in my life i don't want anyone and then there he was and it i guess it's always 

299.27 300.39 A: mhm 

304.34 305.36 A: (( right )) 

307.01 308.38 A: (( oh )) 

309.92 319.18 B: you know when you you hear about stories like this they always you know you always hear that it's when they stop looking that i found the person 

318.85 333.30 A: [laughter] yeah i don't know i guess like when you've really feel like you you have to come with yourself to your partner to so it's like sometimes like things i don't 

319.36 320.68 B: (( so [laughter] )) 

320.73 321.80 B: so 

333.53 337.34 A: both partners have to compromise for each other somehow 

337.01 338.00 B: right 

337.45 338.91 A: you know to keep a 

339.11 341.75 A: smooth and good relationship

342.09 343.38 A: yeah 

343.61 345.14 A: (( yeah )) 

344.42 350.02 B: and i've yeah and i've learnt so much from my fiance you know he's taught 

349.16 350.25 A: mhm 

350.14 355.22 B: he's in the mental health field so he is really good at communicating 

351.82 352.76 A: (( mhm )) 

354.76 355.99 A: (( oh )) 

355.31 358.20 B: and i and i wasn't at first i was like

358.98 360.50 A: [laughter] 

361.77 376.63 B: but now you know it's like you know if i feel bad or you know i feel like i'm taking what he's saying in the wrong way and he just wants to have a good day you know all all we have to do is you know he'll ask 

369.88 370.91 A: mhm 

372.81 373.85 A: [laughter] 

376.92 381.30 B: i don't even know he'll ask like a question and i'll just like tell him how i feel 

381.21 382.30 A: mhm 

381.43 385.25 B: and then you know i'll like apologize if i did something wrong or 

385.31 392.45 B: you know like 'cause like it's so easy to just be a really selfish and just like not even consider their feelings 

389.51 390.97 A: yeah true 

392.36 393.45 A: mhm 

392.53 406.29 B: like it's so easy but then i it is real- just almost well it depends on the person but i to me it's pretty easy to apologize for for doing that and then you know it's just so much better 

401.02 402.27 A: mhm 

406.37 416.01 B: once you do that you know and you you say oh i'm sorry you know i'll try and consider your feelings more today or whatnot and then it's just like all good again [laughter] 

412.36 413.46 A: yeah 

415.81 424.50 A: [laughter] are you like nice thing i'd be like people sometimes will say like oh they don't wanna apologize or something and they just screw things up even more 

416.13 417.14 B: (( so )) 

424.53 426.21 A: things just get worse 

426.25 427.25 B: mhm 

426.95 432.90 A: sometimes it's like feels like a simple thing i'm sorry just makes the other feel better 

432.79 434.34 B: yeah yeah 

434.00 436.28 A: yeah true 

435.00 436.23 B: i think so 

436.38 446.75 A: well then i feel kinda bad i always like shout at my boyfriend somehow i was like oh come on ove- i don't know i oh i don't think i do apologize 

446.87 461.45 A: often sometimes i like i made the mistake i don't wanna admit it [laughter] rub it in and you feel kinda like pants between us and then after a while and i was like all right i'm sorry then we just start like chatting again so 

447.36 448.16 B: yeah 

451.37 452.82 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

461.57 462.57 B: right 

461.64 464.23 A: (( oh yes [laughter] )) 

463.25 472.60 B: i was i remember it was hard you know because it's like you're giving up control another skill that you need to have 

468.95 470.64 A: (( yeah )) 

472.26 473.36 A: mhm 

473.06 479.46 B: you know but it it it's just the long run it's just so much better this would be like 

479.36 480.30 A: yeah 

479.67 482.97 B: you know just to apologize right then and there 'cause that's 

482.19 483.63 A: mhm 

482.99 488.50 B: you know after that the making up and you know being good again that's what's really important 

488.30 495.51 A: yeah true i guess like in the long run it would be a good thing to be considered i mean yeah considerate 

495.61 496.36 A: true 

495.86 496.83 B: yeah 

496.76 498.59 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

497.69 505.24 B: yeah and to have the same pretty much the same like goals as you do in life you know 

504.47 506.03 A: yeah 

505.27 512.73 B: and as well like have similar interests i mean you're not gonna have like exactly the same interests which makes it interesting 

512.35 514.12 A: mhm 

513.43 519.39 B: you know like my partner he uh he never skied and i i've skied all my life
