351.13 358.00 A: i don't know i- oh one thing that i got really upset about and that you know everyone knows is is the the whole american flag 

358.12 362.45 A: thing like the whole commercial- commercialization of of patriotism (( )) whatever 

361.10 361.37 B: yeah 

362.84 363.51 B: yeah 

362.97 365.15 A: i don't know

367.91 369.81 B: yeah (( )) well i think you're (( )) 

369.97 372.08 B: absolutely right it is a little commercial isn't it 

372.21 373.45 A: yeah it got like 

381.00 381.45 B: yeah 

381.14 385.34 A: you know it's like they just saw it as an opportunity to make money and that's like not 

384.24 387.79 B: well there's a lot of truth in that but i think that follows in anything back in 

388.01 393.41 B: every war and everything where the american flag comes in they sell all kinds of pat- patriotic things (( )) 

393.89 394.90 B: baseball cap with 

395.36 395.81 B: down with 

396.12 397.07 B: qaeda pretty soon 

397.61 401.59 A: but like i like it you know when i see american flags all over s._u._v._s. i think that's just 

401.72 402.12 A: like 

402.42 404.18 A: quite an oxymoron 

403.67 405.26 B: you know i it's true 

405.80 409.39 B: it's true th- where i am you know everybody's got an american flag out you know 

409.46 409.95 A: uh-huh 

409.79 410.66 B: just about 

410.82 413.65 B: and even i have one hanging out in front otherwise i think they'll hang me 

414.51 417.62 B: but uh i don't have to worry too much i put my time in 

418.68 419.94 B: a long time ago 

420.77 424.47 B: but i don't think they'll bother me very much but i think you're right that th- 

424.71 427.00 B: awful lot of commercialism about this thing 

425.94 429.27 A: mhm and i definitely think that bush is um 

430.06 432.47 A: using it as a cover almost to like 

432.98 434.79 A: i don't know it it's um 

435.32 436.47 A: if you're interested in like

556.13 559.93 B: angry i can understand it a little bit these muslims you know they have their 

560.09 564.27 B: they are also a little bit half-cocked anything over religious seems to bother me
