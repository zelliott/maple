17.86 19.28 A: well incre- increased 

19.39 20.36 A: precautions 

20.69 22.80 A: should obviously lead to some 

23.19 24.08 A: some degree of 

24.21 25.70 A: of great safety um 

26.36 27.43 A: in air travel 

27.61 28.07 B: uh-huh 

27.96 30.28 A: if if it's at the airport that seems 

30.98 32.24 A: straight forward 

33.17 33.98 B: i guess it 

33.43 35.65 A: obviously they they're a real pain 

34.17 35.45 B: it it i guess it 

36.27 37.69 B: i guess it would eh 

38.43 41.19 B: it may be what i think of is whether 

41.33 42.85 B: the way air secu- court 

43.29 45.75 B: the way airport security is being heightened 

45.98 46.49 A: mhm 

46.24 47.80 B: does that lead to 

48.35 51.03 B: reduced risk and i think it leads to a little bit 

51.41 53.61 B: but not in proportion to the 

54.19 55.04 A: inconvenience 

55.10 58.71 B: not the inconvenience i've been i i haven't traveled lately but 

60.69 64.03 B: last year i traveled a lot and it was never 

62.35 63.33 A: mhm 

64.31 65.44 B: terribly inconvenient 

66.06 66.56 B: um 

66.90 70.34 B: it was a bit of a pain not to be able to carry my pen knife with me and 

70.86 73.02 B: not because i never checked luggage i always brought 

71.16 71.81 A: right 

73.38 74.41 B: it was always carry on 

75.28 78.39 B: it was a pain in the neck not to be able to carry my pen knife and my 

78.92 80.41 B: um 

81.24 82.08 B: nail file 

81.92 84.89 A: nail file and scissors or anything like that 

84.53 86.19 B: yeah but but other than that 

86.71 88.79 B: um usually i went through the check out 

88.92 89.19 B: check 

89.59 90.29 B: pretty quickly 

90.76 91.47 B: i never got 

90.89 91.45 A: mhm 

91.67 92.07 B: did i get 

92.21 93.67 B: stopped i think i got stopped 

94.73 98.12 B: signaled once for a more extensive search but that was quick 

98.90 101.95 A: yes i think i did too and they made me take off my shoes 

102.19 102.65 B: yeah 

103.36 104.67 A: (( )) but uh yeah 

105.82 106.14 A: so 

106.57 107.92 B: it's kind of the reports of 

108.61 111.90 B: of people al gore being stopped and kids and 

112.32 114.21 B: children being stopped and 

112.38 112.89 A: mhm 

114.32 115.39 B: gone over carefully that 

116.40 117.63 B: seems to be a little silly 

118.68 121.19 B: and i don't think the airports are that much more secure 

122.47 123.71 A: no it's it's 

122.52 122.81 B: i think 

124.66 125.01 A: (( )) 

125.29 125.54 A: (( )) 

125.68 128.10 A: the same actually with same uh 

128.74 131.02 A: not so hard for someone to smuggle some 

131.18 132.23 A: say bacteria 

132.56 134.13 A: on board and release it 

134.45 135.51 B: yeah that would be easy 

135.09 136.20 A: like small pox 

136.89 141.43 B: it uh yeah you know what i'm surprised that hasn't happened i i'm glad it hasn't but 

141.48 142.72 A: yeah (( )) 

143.33 144.10 B: um 

143.72 144.89 A: that's a little frightening 

145.22 146.76 B: yeah i mean the other thing is 

148.91 153.76 B: you know if someone w- if if a terrorist really wanted to get on a plane and cause a problem it would be really easy 

154.29 155.56 B: you know you could have uh 

155.76 156.63 A: mhm 

156.50 158.51 B: you know plastic nylon 

158.77 160.74 B: knifes i have a letter opener 

161.45 161.77 B: that 

162.09 164.81 B: i got from i don't know it was in my grandfather's stuff 

165.44 165.77 B: and it's 

166.02 166.84 B: it's nylon 

167.47 170.24 B: and it's a very hard plastic it's very strong 

170.58 171.42 A: and they wouldn't (( )) 

170.62 171.78 B: and it's about 

171.55 173.78 A: wouldn't show up on the scanner 

172.82 175.11 B: wouldn't show up on anything it's about four inches long 

175.94 177.54 B: and could do a lot of damage to someone 

178.86 179.80 A: right yeah 

179.91 180.53 B: um 

181.24 181.93 B: you know it 

182.81 185.02 A: well there are plastic guns too aren't there 

185.26 187.12 B: i don't know i think only in the movies 

187.47 187.74 B: but 

187.61 188.47 A: oh okay 

187.98 188.94 B: i'm sure someone 

189.42 190.12 B: could make one 

192.55 194.16 B: yeah you have plastics guns and 

194.85 195.81 B: and you know but they're like 

196.02 196.68 A: (( )) 

196.11 198.26 B: no knives and forks on the plane 

197.62 199.86 A: you'd plastic f- plastic bullets 

199.98 201.04 A: but i don't know if they have 

201.48 202.57 A: i suppose they do have plastic 

202.01 203.42 B: i think they do at we- rubber bullets 

203.92 204.80 A: right so those 

205.46 206.60 A: those wouldn't show 

206.50 207.88 B: i don't know but i you know 

208.02 209.48 B: a knife is probably fine or 

211.11 212.57 B: i don't know what else you could bring 

213.34 213.83 B: um 

214.71 215.33 B: but i think 

215.52 217.52 B: um reinforcing the cabin doors 

217.87 218.37 B: good idea 

218.61 218.93 B: (( )) 

219.05 219.65 A: right that's 

219.16 220.52 B: the cock pit doors 

221.95 223.33 A: how about arming the pilot 

223.81 225.20 B: i think that's a bad idea 

225.54 226.56 A: yeah i do too 

226.80 227.43 B: i mean 

227.67 231.31 B: you've seen what a cockpit looks like right can you imagine a pilot sitting there and 

229.87 230.50 A: mhm 

232.24 233.23 A: it's sort of cramped 

232.57 236.77 B: what you know someone comes in the pilot's going to find his gun and turn around it 

237.52 240.44 B: and blow a whole in the in the windshield of the plane 

241.55 244.00 B: or you know put a bullet through the the 

242.29 242.87 A: or just 

243.75 244.04 A: (( )) 

244.13 244.94 B: automatic 

245.38 246.36 B: pilot or something 

247.29 251.57 A: right or through a pass- some passengers sitting further back 

250.69 252.07 B: or through a passenger yeah 

251.95 252.85 A: in the plane 

254.19 255.96 A: (( )) right when you're a little panicked 

256.08 257.46 A: when something is happening your 

257.91 259.93 A: your aim may not so that good 

259.89 260.33 B: yeah 

261.40 265.03 A: yeah that's a little frightening and the bush administration did uh 

261.49 262.01 B: so 

265.83 268.45 A: oppose it initially but then finally the 

268.95 270.48 A: n._r._a. and the other group 

270.59 272.91 A: were successful in pushing it through 

273.04 275.70 B: now i i forgot it went through pilots can 

276.11 277.34 A: i think it's g- it's 

276.43 276.68 B: guns 

277.97 282.07 A: i think it's uh gone through i don't know if it's been implemented 

281.62 282.05 B: uh-huh 

282.80 287.71 A: but uh the bush administration finally uh turned turned around and changed it 

288.28 290.07 B: and do they have to take training for it or 

288.48 289.38 A: it's attitude 

290.87 292.70 A: yeah they it's got to require 

292.99 294.80 A: rigorous training they say 

294.27 294.65 B: mhm 

294.93 295.23 A: so 

296.15 296.83 A: we'll see 

296.98 297.96 A: see what happens 

297.95 300.29 B: i just can't imagine that they'd be any use to 

301.41 302.80 A: no (( )) 

303.36 303.95 B: you know 

303.50 309.21 A: they're saying the pilots we've been reading about lately who have been prevented from boarding because they are drunk 

309.27 310.84 B: well that's good 

310.42 311.64 A: and so forth 

311.76 315.24 A: you know i'm thinking of someone who did make it on board with their 

315.65 316.11 A: and 

316.41 317.54 A: has a gun with 

317.76 319.53 A: bullets that's a really 

319.66 320.99 A: frightening prospect 

320.78 322.66 B: and the guy with the bomb in his shoe 

323.22 323.85 A: mhm 

323.74 326.01 B: i thought i mean it's yeah they've been catching 

326.46 329.23 B: i don't know if they've been catching more people but they've publis- 

329.54 330.22 B: publicized 

331.23 331.75 B: um 

332.01 332.56 B: having 

332.71 333.94 B: caught more people but 

334.72 335.85 B: you know the the 

336.86 339.29 B: the statistics of dying in a terrorist attack 

339.75 340.22 B: are 

341.22 345.04 B: you have much less of a chance of dying in terrorist attack than you do in getting hit by a car 

345.39 346.71 B: or being in an auto accident 

346.56 348.37 A: right well they've always said 

348.73 354.52 A: your chances of being in a in a in a crash are far greater on the way to the airport than on the plane 

354.27 354.64 B: yeah 

354.89 355.29 B: so 

356.05 357.87 B: i mean but that's not to say that 

358.45 359.74 B: a terrorist attack is 

360.32 362.64 B: you know you should ignore all that it's just 

363.58 369.09 B: it it isn't that dangerous to travel anyway and we do want to avoid 

367.27 367.75 A: right 

369.84 376.18 A: i think they're worried about things like the twin towers you know where the the whole plane is used as a weapon 

370.68 371.34 B: wherever you want 

375.86 376.28 B: yeah 

376.94 378.21 A: where you can kill (( )) 

379.29 380.90 A: two thousand people or more 

381.24 383.21 B: and i'd be you know it would be interesting to know 

383.57 387.56 B: you know we don't know what went on in those planes maybe they killed everyone in the 

388.40 389.87 B: you know maybe they they just killed 

390.35 392.24 B: you know if you were going to commandeer a plane 

392.61 393.33 B: you'd go in 

393.92 396.49 B: (( thinking )) the plane kill as many people as you can 

396.30 399.05 A: i don't think they were out to kill those people i fe- i 

399.25 400.12 B: yeah but but it 

399.34 400.14 A: think they're they're 

400.36 400.79 B: the 

400.38 402.40 A: they were out to hit the buildings 

402.61 403.84 B: right but you want to get 

404.20 405.08 B: but but 

404.28 408.46 A: so you you get the people automatically that's a bonus that just comes 

407.47 411.52 B: right but there's but there's nothing to lose by creating as much mayhem 

412.05 413.31 B: to to get in 

412.18 414.59 A: but why kill them ahead of time instead of 

413.97 414.63 B: oh because they 

414.74 415.74 B: we- it 

414.81 418.17 A: instead of waiting for the crash into the building to kill them 

418.91 419.57 B: because 

420.34 420.61 B: it 

420.73 422.51 B: it makes everyone really terrified 

423.15 426.54 B: no one knows you're going to bring it you're going to put a buil- uh the plane into the building 

427.05 429.38 B: the people on the on the pennsylvania f- 

429.80 432.53 A: that's true they heard by cell phones 

430.19 430.86 B: crash flight 

432.04 435.34 B: they heard but the other people they had no idea and if you have no idea 

435.99 436.48 B: um 

437.08 438.11 B: you know what's going to do you 

438.20 440.24 B: i guess you you wouldn't resist i i 

439.87 443.95 A: you wouldn't resist you don't e- you'd resist if you knew what was going to happen 

441.00 441.80 B: yeah 

443.35 443.87 B: right 

444.57 449.20 A: and uh that would be the occasion when where they'd try to kill the passengers but 

448.54 451.61 B: right but they may have gone in and killed the crew right away we don't know 

452.99 453.47 B: um 

453.01 455.12 A: they might have done that with a pilot 

454.99 455.62 B: yeah 

456.08 456.52 B: so 

457.17 459.66 A: there's no way no way to check that but 

459.39 462.88 B: yeah and we don't know so you know what happens on a plane we just 

463.86 464.51 B: i don't i guess 

464.65 465.92 B: there have been times (( )) 

466.88 467.14 B: that 

467.25 468.04 B: they've known what 

468.39 469.66 B: what hijackers had done 

470.89 474.82 A: right well the usual hijackers you know you just stay in your seat and uh 

475.11 479.45 A: then cause trouble and hopefully you'll land in cuba or somewhere and uh 

478.83 480.53 B: right 

480.30 482.78 A: get uh sent back eventually 

482.92 483.31 B: yeah 

484.12 485.15 B: but i don't know that 

485.42 485.79 B: (( )) 

486.86 488.73 B: the amount of money we're spending on 

488.97 492.56 B: securing our airports i don't think it's going to actually make any airports more secure 

491.45 494.41 A: well think of the further difficul- further uh 

494.54 496.03 A: complications where they 

496.35 497.88 A: decide to build up a (( )) 

498.02 500.84 A: everyone's resume is on the computer and 

501.64 502.40 B: yeah that's 

502.15 505.24 A: and your likelihood of uh developing 

505.50 506.96 A: too radical ideas 

507.75 509.58 B: i know that's the the restriction of 

509.77 510.14 B: of 

510.32 511.50 B: liberties is really what 

511.92 512.76 B: bothers me a lot 

513.34 516.99 A: (( )) that would be scary if they know where you go who you're going 

517.53 518.86 A: to and so forth 

517.57 521.25 B: yeah well they know i think they know a lot of that already it's all in the
