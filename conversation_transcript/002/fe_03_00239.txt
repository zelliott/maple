24.26 24.97 A: oh yeah 

26.94 29.45 A: yeah that's that's important if that's what you're 

30.26 32.63 A: if that's have you feel too you've got to have a 

34.95 36.17 A: you know similar 

37.03 38.08 A: similar beliefs syst- 

39.04 39.64 A: like that 

40.82 43.73 B: well i have to know that someone actually has like 

43.91 46.62 B: meaning attached to marriage like i need to know that 

47.05 49.93 B: someone isn't just going through the motions or something (( )) 

49.52 50.08 A: yeah 

50.31 52.03 B: in order to be practical like that 

52.00 52.59 A: right 

52.90 55.07 B: that it's actually like a promise and a vow and 

55.21 56.03 B: not something like 

56.14 59.53 B: to be taken light it's something to be worked at and really you know 

60.10 60.85 B: loving 

61.40 62.69 B: all that good stuff 

62.29 62.90 A: yeah 

63.65 64.44 A: i agree 

65.38 66.13 A: are you married 

66.64 66.91 B: nope 

67.53 67.91 A: no 

68.35 69.07 B: are you 

69.10 70.48 A: no i'm not actually 

70.68 70.97 A: i'm 

71.20 72.50 A: i'm engaged though 

72.72 74.36 B: oh that's awesome 

74.17 74.65 A: yeah 

75.69 78.16 A: so i've been thinking about that kind of stuff a lot lately 

78.42 81.02 B: it was the perfect question for you 

79.58 80.78 A: mhm i know 

81.48 85.93 B: i've been thinking about it too and that's why i'm not married 

84.60 86.75 A: thinking about it too much 

86.32 89.40 B: no not really it's just that i i know i haven't meet 

89.46 89.97 A: yeah 

90.23 90.79 B: just one 

90.88 91.16 B: (( two )) 

92.22 94.00 B: to fulfill the criteria 

94.16 94.58 A: yeah 

94.90 96.56 B: yet 

96.97 97.26 B: so 

97.45 97.87 A: yeah 

97.71 98.08 B: but in 

99.16 102.88 B: i'm working on knowing that i'm still happy anyway i don't need to be married i 

103.12 103.85 B: for me like 

104.52 105.97 B: relationship end um 

106.73 115.28 B: marriage pretty heavy topic in my family because my family is pretty old world and tradition and they don't think a women is like a real person unless she's married and i don't agree with that 

114.90 117.92 A: right that's good i'm glad you don't 

115.39 115.77 B: (( )) 

115.90 116.63 B: (( )) 

116.96 117.25 B: (( )) 

117.34 117.65 B: (( )) 

119.36 120.12 B: yeah 

120.13 120.72 A: yeah that's 

120.40 120.85 B: yeah 

121.42 127.21 B: so that's the other thing i guess i would say with like whole life partner stuff like to know that the other person feels that they're a whole person 

127.22 127.83 A: mhm 

128.66 131.07 B: you know prior prior to getting married rather than 

128.72 129.87 A: yeah absolutely 

131.19 133.15 B: you know expecting the other person to make them 

133.39 134.20 B: a whole person 

134.29 134.81 A: right 

135.45 138.12 B: i think that's why a lot of young marriages fail because 

135.58 136.02 A: right 

138.71 139.49 B: people just sort of 

139.64 140.21 B: bond and 

140.62 148.30 B: through hardship and then when things get better and like one person is a little more vigorous and like you know and maybe more alive and coming out of their 

149.10 152.26 B: sort of hard phase of life and the other person may still be left there that 

152.10 152.79 A: mhm 

154.52 155.26 A: that's true 

156.12 157.55 B: can be trouble 

157.16 160.48 A: sounds like you've seen that happen to some of your friends or something 

159.35 163.82 B: oh yeah yeah i can see it now like i know when i got to a wedding like whether the 

164.17 164.46 B: like 

164.66 166.52 B: couple will work out of not 

165.96 166.62 A: mhm 

167.58 169.31 A: yeah i've yeah i've had i have a 

169.77 173.07 A: real close friend who had a really bad experience with a near marriage and 

173.80 174.31 A: um 

174.41 175.19 A: you know but it 

174.88 177.76 B: hard to watch because you want to take care of your friends and so 

177.03 177.92 A: yeah 

178.51 180.70 B: yeah but yet you don't want to offend them like if you 

178.70 179.32 A: yeah 

180.81 181.65 B: you see like 

183.30 184.04 B: something's not nec- 

184.19 185.35 B: necessarily right 

184.97 185.87 A: right well 

191.31 192.06 B: yeah 

193.90 204.91 A: they always know that's what you thought or something but then afterwards when the marriage or you know when the engagement was called off everyone everyone was like oh it wasn't right you know but 

205.09 205.79 A: i don't know 

206.15 208.31 A: i'm glad actually i'm glad it didn't happen 

211.71 212.30 A: yeah 

215.51 217.43 A: so have you done one of these calls before 

217.74 221.70 B: yeah i did one last night for the first time the other thing i guess would say is um 

222.67 223.45 B: yeah i i 

224.12 225.36 B: in terms of like 

226.62 228.55 B: in my opinion i think like 

228.88 234.32 B: you of course have to evaluate whether the person in your life is whole and like mature enough and whether you are but i think 

234.74 241.59 B: like the true tests is also whether your friends like can honestly like stick the two of you together and can honestly like 

241.69 242.21 B: see that 

242.92 251.62 B: you know that it's a comfortable fit like i know when i've been in a relationship where i'm trying to make something work sort make try to make a couple pieces fit like that don't fit like 

244.65 245.32 A: that's true 

251.83 252.72 B: that my my 

252.96 258.36 B: like my parents or friends are able see things that i may not necessarily be able to like admit at the time 

258.03 258.84 A: that's true 

259.28 259.76 B: yeah 

259.28 262.38 A: that's true it is good to be to be open and honest 

262.94 263.81 A: about that 

264.94 266.71 A: that's true 

267.90 270.11 A: it's good that your friends or your family can 

270.20 271.84 A: can sort of clue you in because 

271.96 275.49 A: it's hard to see it on the outside i know that's you know something i feel 

274.67 277.04 B: sometimes you don't ask for it 

276.55 278.07 A: yeah right exactly 

278.10 281.28 B: you got to appreciate that they give that to you so 

280.11 281.06 A: exactly 

282.06 282.74 A: yeah eh 

283.01 283.94 A: that's one that i 

284.30 285.21 A: ah i'm really 

285.42 287.11 A: really ah happy about is i 

288.06 288.67 A: i know once 

288.83 291.30 A: me and my fiance announced our engagement i felt like 

291.83 295.13 A: i got a lot you know affirmation from everybody 

295.44 298.52 A: around us and it's a really good you know a really good feeling 

299.06 299.93 A: because ah 

300.66 301.51 A: i'd say that 

301.67 302.39 A: you know my 

303.16 304.09 A: my group of friends 

304.71 306.38 A: are you know not really 

306.62 308.61 A: mostly anti marriage in a way 

309.20 311.11 A: you know not not necessarily anti marriage but 

311.40 313.18 A: sort of disillusioned 

313.45 314.47 A: about it so 

314.62 317.20 A: so for them to sort of think that was it's was a good idea was ah 

318.44 320.79 A: was a good feeling but 

323.00 323.43 A: you know 

323.82 325.07 A: it's interesting to have

432.96 433.60 A: oh really

436.09 437.45 B: is this is your first call or 

437.04 440.51 A: yeah this is the first one they called me a couple times last night but

443.77 444.49 B: oh okay 

444.20 445.68 A: and it took too long i was 

445.79 447.78 A: i just wasn't in the mood for being on hold so 

449.14 449.74 A: but um 

449.92 451.98 A: but this time it was like right when they rang i guess 

453.00 454.91 A: they already had you lined up or whatever 

459.60 464.56 B: yeah they actually called me for several nights in a row before they had mailed me my pin and so 

464.92 465.81 A: oh really 

465.39 466.29 B: like i couldn't 

466.49 470.05 B: i couldn't respond or do anything and i it just kept (( )) ringing 

469.64 471.78 A: so it was sort of like a crank call 

471.60 472.69 B: yeah 

472.84 474.21 B: driving me crazy 

474.81 475.87 B: nuts

481.61 482.21 A: really 

482.65 483.02 B: yeah 

483.84 484.46 B: i basically 

483.87 485.40 A: oh i didn't know they would leave a message 

485.53 488.66 B: well they just leave the message of the computer recording on your phone 

488.58 489.46 A: oh okay 

490.19 490.86 A: that makes sense 

491.15 491.75 B: sort of useless 

492.04 497.80 B: okay so let's get back on the topic we talked a lot about the topic let's see what else 

494.37 495.03 A: okay 

498.12 504.38 B: um yeah this (( )) so is there anything you're thinking about in your relationship you need to still sort out 

505.96 506.57 A: um 

506.13 506.42 B: like 

506.64 509.66 B: does religion factor in your role and you know your 

510.51 511.74 B: do you want to have kids like 

511.86 515.52 B: do you like feel like you have to work that stuff out before marriage or 

515.25 516.80 A: yeah a little bit i 

517.00 518.70 A: i think kids is a big thing 

518.81 521.12 A: um that we talk about a lot and um
