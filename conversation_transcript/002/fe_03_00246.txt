117.11 117.56 A: but 

117.93 119.37 A: um 

120.66 123.88 A: but every time someone talks about it he diverts it to terrorism 

124.36 124.73 B: right 

124.96 129.51 A: and he hasn't put any money into terrorism he's done a lot but he- they put no money into it

144.13 144.71 A: um 

144.90 147.02 A: only in in purchasing things for 

149.40 149.88 B: mhm 

150.18 150.56 A: but 

150.57 151.05 B: right 

151.29 152.41 A: the homeland defense 

152.07 154.27 B: not towards addressing it in other ways 

154.10 158.90 A: yeah and there no wo- there's no money in the homeland defense the whole organization is being done without 

154.83 155.17 B: right 

159.61 160.79 A: providing funding 

159.92 160.40 B: funding 

161.12 161.75 B: mhm 

163.57 167.57 B: oh yeah i see what you're saying i didn't even think about that 

167.88 169.98 B: so much lately about the 

170.99 175.20 B: distraction from environmental issues and things like that but now that you mention it 

174.11 174.56 A: uh uh 

175.99 176.24 B: it's 

176.50 177.30 B: it's really 

177.84 179.14 B: blatant actually 

179.39 184.61 B: not only bush but maybe in part because of bush but also just the media in general 

185.53 185.93 A: yeah 

186.17 187.77 B: i mean mainstream media 

187.93 188.31 A: yeah 

188.81 191.06 B: are just obsessed with this stuff 

188.94 193.51 A: well i- i- it's convenient you can grab on to it you can report on it 

192.62 193.27 B: right 

195.05 197.58 A: terrorizing and exiting and 

196.89 197.32 B: mhm 

197.93 198.51 B: mhm 

198.29 198.71 A: but it 

199.75 207.27 B: it has the salaciousness appeal or something like that and people keep turning it on and t- turning in to this 

199.78 200.62 A: you know 

202.73 204.17 A: exactly yeah 

207.40 210.47 B: issue i mean i i'm really guilty of it thats one way 

207.60 208.07 A: yeah 

210.02 210.67 A: uh-huh 

210.99 211.87 B: that i think i've 

212.09 213.58 B: been affected for the worst 

214.65 216.31 B: is i've become obsessed with 

216.93 217.40 B: watching 

218.64 219.27 B: and i think 

219.86 221.86 B: you know and the only news i can get 

222.31 223.05 B: are the big 

223.18 223.61 B: you know 

225.28 230.28 B: big mainstream channels and and i but i keep it on i think because of 

230.73 232.17 B: because i was so shocked 

232.56 233.55 B: on nine-eleven 

233.83 236.79 B: and so unprepared and so know i fell like i 

236.95 238.32 B: maybe i'm trying to 

239.33 241.85 B: be ready for it you know or like to be 

240.56 241.10 A: uh-huh 

241.99 244.39 B: to know as soon as anything happens instead of 

244.76 245.92 B: feeling that mm 

246.42 248.74 B: you know getting that kind of phone call again 

249.70 251.04 A: wh- which kind of phone call 

249.73 250.76 B: (( )) 

251.16 251.64 B: well 

251.75 254.14 B: i mean i was doing my work that day 

254.31 254.83 B: and then 

254.96 256.28 B: got a phone call 

255.10 255.51 A: where 

255.93 256.59 A: where was it 

256.97 258.27 B: i'm in pennsylvania 

258.21 258.70 A: uh-huh 

258.92 260.15 A: and you got a phone call from 

259.32 259.68 B: and 

260.08 262.01 B: you know from my boyfriend 

262.12 265.48 B: actually and he said you know are watching the news did you hear what happened

262.23 262.57 A: oh 

262.75 263.16 A: uh-huh 

264.96 265.32 A: right 

265.67 266.83 B: and that you know 

267.01 268.61 B: that that initial 

268.79 269.50 B: fear 

269.97 275.54 B: like not knowing what he was talking about feeling like i didn't know what was going on that there was some disaster 

276.14 276.95 B: you know that was 

277.26 280.02 B: just a unique experience in my life and i think 

279.34 280.42 A: that's interesting yeah 

281.03 284.97 B: i've never i haven't gotten over it yet i'm still kind of waiting for the next 

283.32 283.79 A: really 

285.24 286.36 B: next thing 

286.99 290.39 A: are you waiting for the next thing to happen for the next attack or the next 

287.20 287.59 B: mhm 

288.96 289.35 B: yeah 

290.27 292.14 B: next disaster mhm 

291.70 295.78 A: but um why how does a disaster 

297.32 300.81 A: mhm how is that disaster different from 

302.20 305.21 A: a plane crash or earthquake 

305.33 305.82 A: or a 

305.61 306.77 B: mhm mhm 

305.94 311.21 A: tornado that takes that many planer crashes don't take that many lives but earthquakes do 

311.49 315.08 B: yeah well the the big difference there was the intent 

315.20 317.24 B: behind it you know that i mean 

317.42 318.32 B: struggling with 

318.82 320.45 B: the realization that 

320.69 324.79 B: a few people were willing to you know kill themselves and 

325.13 326.61 B: thought that killing all these 

326.89 327.54 B: people 

328.21 329.23 B: was a good idea 

329.60 330.48 A: mhm yeah 

330.82 331.34 A: and is that 

331.52 332.67 A: different than 

333.07 334.56 A: the thousands of people that have 

334.78 337.83 A: died in in israel from 

338.21 343.93 A: terrorist attacks or the hundreds of thousands of serbs or the millions of 

344.40 346.16 A: um rwandans 

346.60 346.92 B: n- 

347.24 351.73 B: well the thing is for me it personally affected me more because 

347.71 348.77 A: how is that different 

351.37 351.88 A: okay 

352.47 354.02 B: it was mhm 

354.97 356.29 B: the first time i could 

356.52 358.12 B: relate to that kind of thing 

359.37 362.85 B: a in a deeper level but since then i've become 

363.02 364.82 B: know much more concerned about 

365.92 367.18 B: this kind of you know 

367.35 370.01 B: conflict human against human conflict 

370.14 375.68 B: in general in the world war and all these things i'm really struggling with the you know what 

371.15 371.60 A: mhm 

375.98 380.08 B: motivates people to think that killing other people is the solution 

379.76 380.57 A: mhm yeah 

380.40 380.81 B: and i 

381.12 381.86 B: and i don't 

382.48 386.63 B: i mean i'm not ready to say that i'm a complete pacifist and i think that 

387.06 387.84 B: its never 

388.51 389.23 B: it's never 

389.39 390.13 B: appropriate 

391.10 391.48 B: but 

392.41 396.07 B: i don't know but i'm i'm i- really struggling with finding 

396.48 398.79 B: some principals on which i think it is 

399.29 402.46 B: it is the best way is t- is to murder people 

402.92 403.68 A: yeah yeah 

403.19 403.46 B: so 

404.84 405.66 B: see what i'm saying 

405.95 409.40 A: yeah i i i i know exactly what you are saying 

411.54 413.58 A: if if you were 

415.83 416.53 A: um 

416.82 419.14 A: you know i'm wondering imagine if 

419.99 421.83 A: you know get into their heads i know its 

422.09 425.15 A: i not justifying what they've done 

426.12 426.94 A: um and i think 

427.74 428.49 A: (( )) 

428.73 430.08 A: the whole 

430.90 431.48 A: terrorist 

432.54 433.51 A: motivation is 

434.68 436.04 A: is really skewed and not 

436.30 437.91 A: not at all in reaction to 

438.04 438.68 A: real events 

439.43 439.79 A: it 

439.46 439.90 B: mhm 

440.35 442.49 A: you know it's totally brainwashing 

443.01 443.58 B: mhm 

443.48 444.06 A: um 

445.02 450.24 A: (( )) i think the arabian states are really guilty of fomenting 

450.69 451.24 B: mhm 

450.73 451.31 A: hatred 

451.70 452.18 B: mhm 

452.41 453.03 A: um 

453.50 455.95 A: through lies and half truths 

457.70 458.67 A: but um 

459.72 461.23 A: you know im- imagine of you thought 

462.46 463.08 A: someone had 

464.13 467.11 A: marched in a destroyed your home-town and killed all your family 

466.83 470.36 B: mhm i know that's what i'm saying i am saying i am imagining those things 

468.83 469.40 A: you know 

469.64 471.34 A: would you would you 

472.05 473.41 A: given an opportunity 

473.90 475.75 A: kill those responsible or 

475.85 477.13 A: or seek retribution 

478.67 479.85 B: yeah i can't say 

480.54 481.73 B: for sure that i wouldn't 

481.77 483.55 A: yeah i i don't i'm not sure either 

484.74 485.21 B: and 

484.84 485.40 A: um 

487.05 487.98 A: and and 

489.71 491.90 A: yeah i i think that the situation is just 

492.01 493.20 A: really difficult and 

494.92 496.70 A: and and the one thing that nine-eleven 

497.26 497.59 A: did 

498.77 501.75 A: i i don't know if it you know for me i don't know if it changed 

502.48 506.11 A: my feeling about terrorism or my feeling about any of that it 

504.60 505.05 B: mhm 

506.69 508.17 A: it's frustrating for me that 

508.60 510.35 A: nine-eleven did change anything 

511.49 512.98 B: it's frustrating that it did 

511.52 512.67 A: cause i 

512.93 517.01 A: yeah because i i think it changed a lot of things that i think have nothing to do with terrorism 

517.26 517.67 A: and have 

517.37 517.67 B: right 

518.49 523.40 A: and in fact the the terrorist ha- our reaction indicates that the terrorist have won 

524.19 525.38 B: mhm 

524.55 525.53 A: that they accomplished 

525.75 527.28 A: the goals they accomplished by 

527.39 528.51 A: hitting those towers 

528.70 529.69 B: yeah its true 

529.21 533.79 A: um completely cratered the economy and the economy cratered not because the towers were hit 

532.00 532.87 B: uh 

534.58 537.72 A: it it they cratered because our reaction was so 

537.10 537.74 B: fear 

538.31 541.81 A: yeah it was fear and clamping down on civil rights 

542.01 542.77 B: mhm 

542.26 543.55 A: and justifying 

542.87 543.55 B: mhm 

544.34 545.77 A: i mean there's a whole debate about 

546.70 547.70 A: you know how 

548.00 549.63 A: much civil rights we lose 

550.25 551.98 A: for our quote and quote security 

552.27 554.85 A: and we're losing civil rights but not gaining security 

555.34 557.26 B: mhm mhm mhm 

555.72 557.45 A: i don't think we're any more secure 

557.82 558.49 A: then we were 

557.90 558.43 B: mhm 

558.85 559.43 A: i've been 

558.91 561.83 B: mhm no i think we're worst off in fact 

559.75 560.08 A: i 

561.98 562.91 B: especially with all this 

562.02 562.41 A: yeah 

564.20 568.77 B: this threatening talk towards other countries i think that's just going to make things a lot worse 

566.76 567.19 A: yeah 

569.03 569.49 A: yeah 

570.49 571.11 A: um 

572.90 574.13 A: so i it's it's that's 

574.52 577.41 A: that's the change for me has been um um 

577.71 580.08 A: more afraid then i have been before 

580.38 580.92 A: of 

581.22 582.22 A: the future of 

582.44 585.04 A: the united states of open-minded 

583.46 584.04 B: mhm 

584.40 584.96 B: mm 

585.55 586.32 B: mm 

585.79 587.16 A: um leader in the world 

587.29 587.76 A: i it 

587.89 588.43 A: i think it 

589.01 590.06 A: we're becoming 

590.96 591.75 A: um 

592.42 593.64 A: as myopic 

594.35 594.64 A: as 

594.76 596.44 A: the um islamic 

597.99 599.12 A: th- the islamic terrorist 

599.51 600.76 B: isn't that ironic 

601.22 601.64 A: yeah 

601.33 601.68 B: but 

601.81 602.12 B: i 

602.36 603.24 B: i would say 

604.38 605.34 B: that i think 

605.88 608.60 B: i mean this could be seen as a a victory for the 

608.77 610.37 B: the terrorist but maybe one that is 

611.01 612.21 B: i good overall 

612.76 613.64 B: as well as that 

614.16 616.57 B: it has really increased awareness of 

616.84 617.31 B: um 

618.50 623.86 B: our interdependence in the world and and of all the conflicts and of all the hate 

624.33 626.20 B: some people were always following this 

626.39 626.83 A: mhm 

631.35 631.69 A: right 

634.79 639.17 B: now there are a lot of people talking about things that they weren't talking about before 

638.94 639.53 A: that's true 

639.97 642.22 A: but is it in the news are they being exposed 

640.09 640.60 B: and that's 

642.45 643.46 A: to more then 

643.74 645.49 A: then sort of right wing 

645.83 647.34 A: rhetoric is it a balanced 

646.62 647.13 B: well 

647.80 648.47 A: discussion 

648.89 650.75 B: i don't know if it's balanced in fact 

651.07 653.68 B: i think it's not balanced but i think at least 

654.14 661.04 B: the the topics are out there more people know what al qaeda is people know about what's happening in israel 

656.92 658.48 A: yeah i i would agr- 

658.65 659.09 A: yeah 

661.26 661.66 A: yeah
