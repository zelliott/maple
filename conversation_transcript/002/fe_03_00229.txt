2.65 3.75 A: hello um 

3.85 5.00 A: my name is leo 

5.96 6.97 B: my name is lisa 

8.09 9.68 A: and how are you today 

9.95 10.90 B: good thank you 

12.25 15.52 A: so the topic is life partners, do you have anything to say about it? 

14.06 14.50 B: yeah 

16.15 17.33 B: um 

17.65 19.59 B: well uh pretty much just 

20.28 23.58 B: if you're compatible, if you have like the same goals, 

23.94 27.95 B: or you know looking for the same things at that moment in your life, then 

28.25 29.98 B: that's the most important thing 

32.30 33.59 A: well uh 

34.28 38.26 A: that's true, interesting is though that you said if you're looking for the same goals 

38.36 41.81 A: at that time in the life, however it's lifetime partners 

43.14 44.60 A: so i am wondering 

45.20 45.90 A: can we 

46.13 49.46 A: actually guess what our goal is going to be for the whole life? 

51.02 54.36 B: well i guess uh once you get together with someone 

56.05 57.25 B: um 

57.66 59.70 B: you know you change together 

60.58 62.23 B: so those goals 

63.48 66.45 B: you know you're going to influence the other person no matter 

66.79 67.63 B: what you do 

67.90 69.56 B: you know just by being there so 

70.03 72.00 B: those goals might change and they might 

72.26 76.02 B: get more become more or less the same or mirror each other 

76.35 79.53 B: or at least uh not compete with each other so 

79.65 80.44 B: that's important 

81.98 85.41 A: so basically i think what you are saying is that 

85.51 86.86 A: sometimes we need to go 

87.16 90.01 A: for compromises if we want to go be 

90.51 93.70 A: good life partners for the other side as well 

93.89 94.28 B: yeah 

96.40 101.96 A: well um what i think about life partners uh i guess mostly similar 

102.37 104.46 A: things what you just said 

104.93 107.47 A: um i think that 

108.27 114.87 A: two people should not be exactly the same because otherwise 

115.45 116.81 A: people might get bored 

117.47 118.47 A: of 

119.58 126.89 A: just not having anything to talk about because you always know you have the same opinion in every case what do you think about that 

127.56 131.33 B: well that's very true, you always have to keep a conversation going 

132.62 135.53 A: and how about the expression the opposites attract? 

136.94 137.84 B: well 

137.63 140.63 A: do you think it's valid in this context or 

140.80 141.54 A: not really 

142.47 143.78 A: do you believe in that 

144.39 145.11 B: i guess 

146.52 147.16 B: i guess 

147.73 150.03 B: i could maybe find somebody who's 

150.17 151.82 B: very different from me attractive 

152.11 152.74 B: uh 

153.61 156.50 B: but in the end you do have to have like 

156.66 158.36 B: major things in common 

159.88 161.07 B: because otherwise 

162.07 162.56 B: like 

163.43 167.84 B: i don't know you'll just like be arguing all the time where you'll be competing against each other for different things 

168.96 169.80 B: so i guess 

170.27 172.02 B: for the sake of novelty 

172.51 175.31 B: opposites do attract but in the long run it's 

175.40 176.72 B: just not something that works out 

179.14 181.65 A: well i guess i have to agree with you 

182.31 184.07 A: on this particular one because 

184.47 188.18 A: just like you said, if you have to argue about 

188.57 190.86 A: big things or small things all the time 

191.53 193.39 A: it's just not 

193.51 197.81 A: worth it it's not going to be i guess the main goal for 

198.04 199.15 A: you to have a 

199.49 201.52 A: life partner not goal but 

201.88 212.86 A: to see that somebody is your the right life partner for you eh that you are happy with being with that person that that person is happy being with you 

213.04 213.51 B: mhm 

213.66 216.64 A: and that that is not going to change in the fu- 

216.86 217.48 A: future 

218.02 220.67 A: i guess that's how i would see the ideal case 

220.76 224.18 B: well you don't really know if that person is going to change in the future 

224.90 229.99 B: because while you are like living together and you know experiencing new things together 

230.89 231.41 B: uh 

233.14 233.61 B: it is 

234.02 237.20 B: fully possible for you to experience something on your own and 

237.61 239.15 B: change because of it and 

240.58 244.15 B: this you know your life partner doesn't maybe understand it 

245.23 247.01 B: or doesn't agree with it and then 

248.14 252.92 A: so what do you what do you think of the following 

248.50 248.89 B: (( )) 

253.15 255.13 A: uh for instance 

256.00 257.93 A: two people meet and then they 

258.95 265.41 A: talk and som- and person a. says one thing but person b. understands it differently 

266.35 268.85 A: does that mean they will never be life partners 

268.96 269.70 A: or 

269.93 271.97 A: they could learn each other's 

272.91 273.48 A: um 

273.46 276.76 B: well you can always learn somebody else's like way of thinking 

278.90 284.07 B: whether they can become life partners yeah i mean people have disagreements all the time 

286.63 290.60 A: right but i guess we are talking here about ideal life partners 

292.10 292.70 A: or uh 

293.20 294.03 A: are we not 

295.11 296.56 B: yeah i don't see why not 

297.64 298.36 B: i mean it's just 

299.23 299.75 B: uh 

299.91 301.23 A: i gue- i guess 

300.81 303.52 B: it's just a manner just a matter of 

302.15 302.52 A: mhm 

304.63 307.99 B: seeing things from a different perspective which we can all learn how to do 

309.14 312.76 A: i think there are so many different people and there are so many different 

313.20 314.73 A: ways of thinking that it's 

314.84 316.32 A: just inevitable for 

317.02 317.72 A: uh 

318.12 320.29 A: two people to be misunderstood 

320.56 322.61 A: o- once in a while and 

322.75 323.74 A: you just have to 

324.60 327.87 A: uh accept that and learn 

328.76 330.30 A: maybe and that's 

330.91 331.61 A: part of 

332.07 338.47 A: experience of being life partners. i also think that one nice thing about life partners would be that 

339.57 342.30 A: you can always learn the other person 

342.48 343.82 A: about the other person 

344.52 345.28 A: and 

345.56 349.36 A: so to say never be satisfied always find new things 

349.60 352.20 A: and always find new things that you like about that person 

353.72 356.69 A: but the problem is to guess who's going to be that way 

357.01 357.62 B: mhm 

358.28 359.06 B: very true 

360.53 361.12 A: uh 

360.56 363.46 B: but you don't really know i guess it's somebody that like gets you (( )) 

365.31 366.06 A: uh right 

367.69 372.59 A: uh may i ask uh do you think you have found a life partner 

373.34 375.35 A: or is this too personal of a question 

375.48 376.09 B: uh 

376.49 378.29 A: i have no way of tracking you 

378.87 379.40 A: by the way 

380.92 381.69 B: no i guess 

381.87 385.89 B: no i'm much too young to have found anybody that i want to spend the rest of my life with 

387.57 388.19 A: i see 

389.81 391.82 A: well i guess i have uh 

392.63 394.70 A: found somebody 

394.85 396.36 A: my experience is that 

397.09 401.58 A: i thought somebody was my life partner but then it turned out that 

401.71 403.31 A: i was wrong about this 

403.63 405.49 A: or we were wrong about this 

405.83 408.17 A: however there was no uh 

409.74 413.40 A: hard feelings involved in the end and now i am with somebody else 

415.01 418.69 A: so i would like very much to believe that this is my life partner 

415.08 415.36 B: hm 

420.81 427.52 A: uh what have i learned from this that sometimes we do make mistakes and sometimes we see that 

428.55 429.21 A: uh 

429.30 432.59 A: what we think is a life partner is is really not a life 

432.70 433.12 A: partner 

436.59 441.60 A: and uh i wonder if it is always because of 

442.24 445.82 A: we are not just compatible or because 

446.17 449.04 A: we just don't give each other enough 

449.62 452.49 A: slack so to say or or enough 

452.93 453.88 A: understanding 

455.49 456.53 A: what do you think about that 

458.90 459.34 B: i guess 

460.12 463.97 B: i kind of like to believe that sometimes it's just not meant to be 

465.25 466.31 B: you know some people just 

466.78 468.72 B: match better with others and 

469.81 472.10 B: there's no really there's not really any 

472.44 474.46 B: uh concrete reason it's just 

475.72 477.33 B: yeah different intangibles 

477.78 487.63 A: uh l- let's talk about slightly different aspect what do you think about education and life partners should they both be on the same level or 

487.95 494.96 A: does it not matter should both of them have college degrees or should both of them should be uh eh down 

495.23 496.12 A: to earth 

496.68 499.06 A: just high school education or or 

500.16 502.10 A: or can we mix and match 

502.56 503.52 B: well it depends 

502.61 503.74 A: professors 

503.74 506.76 B: it depends what you feel challenges you 

507.79 510.64 B: if you are a nobel laureate 

510.96 511.56 B: and 

512.18 516.21 B: you feel challenged by a quote unquote free spirit 

517.35 518.11 B: well then 

518.37 518.74 B: you know 

518.84 520.23 B: power to you but if 

521.00 522.21 B: you feel that the only 

522.39 526.32 B: type of person that challenges you is another nobel laureate 

527.29 527.87 B: or 

528.49 528.82 B: you know 

528.98 532.42 B: a person who has achieved the maximum degree in his or her field 

533.97 534.56 B: then 

535.10 535.51 B: you know 

536.06 538.04 B: then you go for whatever challenges you 

539.54 540.18 A: eh but 

540.75 545.77 A: so that sounds like you think uh that life partners is about challenging each other 

546.31 548.30 B: i do think it should be like that 

549.43 551.97 B: you don't want to be with somebody who's passive all the time 

553.67 554.90 A: right and 

554.18 556.88 B: and who doesn't you know like test you or 

557.95 558.74 A: okay 

558.00 561.31 B: or who doesn't you know make you see things in a different way 

561.57 563.08 B: because that would be just boring 

563.84 568.49 A: so huh can you explain what you mean a little more in detail what you mean by challenging each other 

569.31 570.96 B: well basically just like 

573.07 573.67 B: uh 

574.14 577.75 B: making them see things in a different way exposing them to a 

578.30 581.29 B: different way of thought a different way of doing things 

582.17 582.77 B: uh 

583.51 584.71 B: making you think 

585.96 588.00 B: about different ways of doing things 

588.19 589.05 B: that sort of thing 

591.61 592.29 A: (( well )) 

593.39 594.75 A: i think it's a good thought 

595.25 598.69 A: it's it's sort of that way we can enrich 

598.85 600.07 A: each other's life 

600.48 601.60 A: with our life partner 

602.71 606.25 A: by by opening the other possibilities 

606.76 608.54 A: or other visions of the world 

609.85 610.80 A: that maybe 

611.63 613.89 A: the other person would not see and vice versa 

614.59 616.64 A: seeing world with the other person's 

617.03 617.50 A: eyes 

618.02 619.13 A: is that what you meant 

619.16 619.51 B: yeah 

620.44 621.98 A: do you think there are 

622.88 627.54 A: uh any other qualities that life partners should have in common or 

628.25 629.55 A: or that are important 

629.75 632.65 A: for us to consider when we choose a life partner 

633.61 634.34 B: well 

635.15 637.19 B: there's definitely the uh 

638.43 639.30 B: the element of 

639.96 641.02 B: how strong 

641.23 642.04 B: the person is 

643.33 645.10 B: how strong like spiritually 

646.22 649.09 A: uh what do you mean by that do you mean uh 

649.52 651.00 B: like that they're stable 

650.08 652.10 A: religiously as well or 

651.31 653.07 B: no no i mean like 

652.51 653.04 A: okay 

654.16 654.80 B: that uh 

655.07 657.62 B: that you know they're able to withstand any 

658.28 661.08 B: any bad thing that could happen to the relationship or 

661.16 662.29 A: any hardships 

662.20 662.55 B: yes 

664.27 665.97 A: yes i i agree with that 

668.62 672.33 A: we we never touched the subject the subject of intimacy 

673.30 678.07 A: and life partners do you think uh it matters or not really 

678.65 680.82 A: how how well adjusted 

680.96 682.06 A: life partners are 

682.30 683.04 A: intimately 

684.51 686.99 B: i guess it does i mean they have to find each other attractive 

687.15 687.86 B: as well so 

691.59 693.43 B: i guess it's a very important element 

697.06 697.74 A: okay 

699.09 702.23 A: uh anything else that we should talk about 

703.38 704.02 B: i don't know 

706.76 707.62 A: so uh 

708.66 709.42 A: let's see 

711.58 716.21 A: how ho- ow- at what age people should decide 

716.73 719.27 A: who's going to be their la- uh life partner
