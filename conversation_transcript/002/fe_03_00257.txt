50.48 50.97 A: really 

51.02 52.86 B: now than i have before yeah 

52.93 53.36 A: uh-huh 

53.45 54.18 B: how about you 

54.65 56.22 A: i don't think that um 

57.08 59.85 A: i think right after it happened i actually became more cynical 

72.72 81.00 A: we're going to come together and bond and everything and nobody treated me any differently everybody still continued to treat me like crap at my job like i mean like customers and 

81.30 85.62 A: people who worked there and everything it just didn't seem like everything that they were talking about 

85.78 87.92 A: was going to happen was actually happening 

87.53 91.80 B: yeah it seemed like anything that you saw like that was like on t._v. 

91.72 92.35 A: yeah 

92.69 93.32 A: so i just 

93.43 95.66 A: i actually became more cynical then 

95.79 96.73 A: and um 

97.26 102.54 A: i almost got punched in the face a few times for (( saying )) a few things like you know saying 

103.42 107.57 A: saying these cynical things that people um didn't think were very nice 

108.31 111.24 A: so i think people have calmed down about it a lot more now 

111.41 114.19 A: although it's still really a sensitive topic i think 

114.21 116.55 B: yeah w- i think like in the beginning 

116.72 117.29 B: um 

118.04 118.90 B: i think like 

119.08 130.48 B: the first couple of months after it happened i would say up until maybe like march everybody was like all about the american flag and all that stuff but it just died out and people just got back to normal really 

122.87 123.31 A: uh-huh 

126.33 127.00 A: yeah 

130.25 132.87 A: yeah and that's another thing and that's what people didn't like 

133.03 140.74 A: that i was saying at the very beginning i kept saying things like i give this six months i give this a year and after that 

138.46 141.24 B: but that's only realistic really 

140.95 142.99 A: it's it's just going to be another 

143.17 144.63 A: part of our history 

144.88 148.63 A: so maybe that's a little too cynical but i think it did affect me in that 

149.10 149.65 A: um 

150.58 151.42 A: i'm more 

152.61 154.06 A: i don't know what the word is like 

154.52 156.02 A: trying to think of what is going on 

156.21 158.28 A: what america is doing in the rest of the world 

158.30 162.25 B: yeah all that uh foreign policies i'm so 

162.47 170.13 B: concerned about current events lately i read the paper like everyday and watch the news everyday just to see what's going on i watch c._n._n. everyday 

164.55 165.10 A: mhm 

167.13 167.72 A: yeah 

170.03 170.56 A: really 

170.36 171.67 B: yeah 

177.99 183.94 A: so i'm really concerned about social services and domestic things and ever since then i've been a little bit more concerned with 

184.43 186.82 A: global things and how we can 

186.94 190.64 A: you know help out globally instead of just focusing on inside the country 

190.79 193.79 B: yeah i definitely noticed i form my own opinion 

193.92 194.57 A: mhm 

193.97 196.72 B: con- like concerning foreign policies too 

196.71 197.13 A: mhm 

197.48 198.42 B: like i uh 

198.74 200.89 B: i disagree with a lot but um 

201.80 204.30 B: i don't know some of it i think could be good 

204.41 204.91 A: yeah 

204.91 205.72 B: for us 

205.95 206.39 A: yeah 

207.18 208.13 B: but 

209.32 210.36 A: well i think um 

211.34 214.82 A: i was actually i was visiting europe in this summer 

214.94 218.68 A: and uh we were i was learning the czech language we were um 

218.88 221.97 A: just asking each other questions we were trying to think of good questions to ask 

222.42 225.18 A: and one of the questions that we picked out of like this little hat 

225.56 227.83 A: well in czech of course because we were practicing a language 

228.12 231.69 A: was you know where were you on september eleventh how did you feel 

238.79 240.18 A: it surprised me that it was 

240.27 243.97 A: so it had almost been an entire year and i still felt really upset 

244.76 247.14 A: this summer when i w- actually started talking about it 

247.39 247.92 A: again 

249.32 252.42 A: i think the cynicism had like died away more and i was just a little bit more 

253.34 253.92 A: um 

255.21 256.18 A: concerned i guess 

257.27 258.49 A: i don't know 

258.49 263.55 B: well i'm only um i'm nineteen i was eighteen when it happened 

263.33 263.82 A: uh-huh 

263.89 267.50 B: and it was my first year in school like school had just started 

266.73 267.97 A: oh yeah uh-huh 

267.71 268.56 B: and uh 

275.27 275.71 A: mhm 

276.20 276.55 B: all this 

282.27 283.40 A: oh really uh-huh 

283.61 284.02 A: yeah 

288.59 289.40 A: right mhm 

289.93 292.64 B: all that stuff and just (( )) i think 

292.90 301.68 B: at the like at my age even now just like realizing like what the real world is actually about i'm not sheltered in high school anymore like i'm out in the city 

300.02 300.68 A: mhm 

301.87 303.75 B: and i still like see stuff all the time 

304.17 307.50 A: i think uh a lot of people especially on college campuses 

307.93 311.33 A: want to show you that if you are american then you are sheltered 

311.79 314.29 A: um basically i mean there is people who are living 

314.65 318.57 A: other ways in other countries that's completely different than anything that we can comprehend 

318.59 319.19 B: right 

318.95 320.13 A: our poverty is 

320.23 321.21 A: so much different 

321.69 327.20 A: from the poverty that they feel in africa and the poverty that they have in asia and even (( )) those you know 

327.38 329.24 A: like europe and the middle east and everything 

329.61 332.59 A: um i actually went to africa a few years ago 

332.88 334.83 A: and what i saw there is just 

335.24 336.31 A: it completely changed 

336.42 336.92 A: my 

337.36 338.42 A: my view you know 

338.92 344.89 A: so that was another thing that made me sort of think about what's happening internationally instead of just what's happening here 

345.42 346.36 B: yeah 

346.66 349.15 A: i think that's the big thing with september eleventh like you just 

349.72 351.02 A: i mean americans 

350.39 357.85 B: you got to realize yeah that other stuff is going on in the other parts of the world it's not just what's going on in in america and what's going on in your neighborhood and city 

352.96 353.72 A: yeah 

353.91 355.02 A: no idea 

357.99 358.41 A: right 

358.72 359.20 B: (( think there's )) 

359.31 362.61 B: there's a lot more problems out there than we actually have personally 

363.56 364.30 B: i would say 

364.21 368.90 A: and i think uh a lot of the people who were passing out stuff about bush and about foreign policy and everything 

369.30 370.47 A: um i think what they want 

370.75 372.05 A: people to see is that 

372.45 377.75 A: a lot of these things (( that )) are going on actually you know america is supporting them 

378.11 381.05 A: not maybe not directly but america is doing something 

381.40 382.76 A: that supports these 

383.76 386.59 A: um policies or the world bank or 

386.81 387.60 A: you know th- 

387.80 391.07 A: international monetary fund or whatever and they're 

391.51 393.43 A: sort of helping create these problems 

393.24 398.90 B: yeah i'm sure these people have good intentions i was just saying personally i don't i don't like that at all 

396.26 396.95 A: mhm yeah 

398.77 402.13 A: yeah usually i try to run away from people who are 

400.46 403.11 B: yeah or you know no thanks 

402.72 408.56 A: at my school thought it w- it's not usually people who are passing out things about bush it's usually people who are um 

408.90 413.39 A: prophesying on the on the streets and everything 

413.48 416.93 A: like please leave me alone i don't want to join your cult 

416.66 418.69 B: yeah we got a couple of them too 

419.61 420.09 A: so 

421.17 424.46 B: oh what else where were you when it happened 

424.50 426.19 A: i was actually sleeping 

426.34 427.07 B: were you 

427.06 430.19 A: i li- everybody else in the entire world was up and uh 

430.51 433.43 A: awake and watching the news and i was sleeping 

433.82 438.35 A: and i woke up really late because i had been up so late the last night and i had to go to work 

438.45 442.68 A: so i go i don't even turn on the t._v. i just go and i start waiting for the bus 

450.61 453.46 A: what the hell is wrong with the busses i need to go to work (( )) 

453.79 455.29 A: and so i march back to my house 

455.87 465.60 A: and i get on the phone to call um the bus line to complain about no busses and here there is a message from my dad and he is asking me if i'm okay and all this stuff and i still don't know what's going on

468.25 470.08 A: well i don't know what state your in but i'm in ohio 

470.55 477.18 A: so i turned on ohio news network thinking that it was something specifically in my city and not nationwide

482.38 484.70 A: like there was like a bomb threat or something
