2.72 5.98 B: hi kevin my name is cindy i'm arizona where are you 

8.33 11.80 B: oh okay and i'm on my cell phone so i hope that's not a problem 

11.81 20.86 A: well i am also so that makes two of us all right so where supposed to talk about airport security 

13.43 14.69 B: okay cool 

15.27 16.73 B: cool cool okay 

20.38 23.30 B: and weather or not it reduces the potential of terrorism 

23.51 26.64 A: i think so i think that's the topic yeah 

25.18 25.73 B: yeah 

26.74 28.16 A: um 

29.16 31.55 A: truthfully i don't know 

31.14 33.52 B: yeah i don't either i hope 

41.44 44.16 A: well at least in the airports i've been in i've seen 

44.25 47.68 A: more guards and i've seen people being searched more 

47.80 58.35 A: but at the same time it doesn't seem to be slowing down anything to me i mean any travel or anything like that i hope they catch anything 

58.68 66.80 A: someone might be trying to get through the airports but if they don't search everyone then there's always that possibility that things can get through so 

67.28 68.45 B: yeah given 

67.49 69.15 A: who knows 

68.82 71.96 B: yeah who knows given how much 

73.73 78.10 B: what we know now is that people have qualms about blowing themselves up 

78.55 79.91 A: right 

79.58 87.70 B: so so the fact that we're searching people and their person and what they have on their person or what they may have in their carry on luggage 

87.86 88.34 A: mm 

88.05 88.50 B: i don't 

88.66 92.14 B: i don't know how much weight that carries if people are 

92.41 93.77 B: also willing to put 

94.11 95.61 B: anything in their 

95.81 97.93 B: luggage i mean i know that they've increased 

98.38 100.01 B: security for that but 

100.58 101.83 B: if some one 

102.23 109.71 B: it use to be that use to be a parameter don't put a bag on the plane if there's not a person to go with it because theoretically someone won't 

109.88 112.58 B: blow themselves up but that doesn't hold true anymore 

112.70 114.58 A: right 

114.63 115.29 B: so 

115.41 116.55 B: i don't know if makes 

116.97 119.67 B: if it's making that much of a difference that they've got people 

119.82 122.26 B: inside the airport checking people and 

122.64 123.67 B: carry-on luggage 

139.99 145.69 A: i don't know i can't really think of any specific cases right now but it seems to me i've heard several times in the news even lately 

146.22 147.07 A: of people 

162.49 163.32 A: um 

164.22 169.72 A: i don't it seems like people still are able to get through and so um 

170.32 173.32 A: i don't know i have really mixed opinions on 

173.45 175.95 A: this sort of thing so 

176.81 184.14 B: i do too and i don't have a huge knowledge base on it i have not i'm not in a position right now where i'm traveling a lot 

184.42 184.90 A: mm 

185.13 190.55 B: oh i'm not out there experiencing this on a regular basis like i would have been had it happened 

190.91 192.87 B: three years ago or three or four years ago 

192.10 192.59 A: right 

194.65 201.96 A: so yeah i don't know sort of bad topic to have chosen for us i guess 

195.93 196.64 B: i don't know 

202.52 206.27 B: we can we can talk about it we just don't know we don't have any definitive 

204.94 205.68 A: yeah 

206.66 207.45 B: thoughts on it 

208.24 208.74 B: uh 

217.45 219.93 A: truthful solve the problem it it 

220.46 228.98 A: not only the united states but other countries have to implement some sort of security plans also i know in europe they do 

229.09 230.42 A: and 

229.49 233.30 B: they do i was in lyndon and spain this summer and they 

232.78 233.23 A: mm 

234.01 239.80 B: london things we're rather strict going from london to spain 

237.09 237.46 A: right 

240.13 242.04 B: i um i encountered 

242.45 244.80 B: an equivalent amount of security that i would have faced 

244.92 246.78 B: that i did face here in the u._s. 

247.11 247.59 A: uh-huh 

247.26 247.64 B: but 

247.81 251.13 B: in spain leaving spain like nothing 

251.67 252.22 A: right 

252.08 253.56 B: nothing yeah it was it was 

252.90 257.42 A: yeah it was i use i use to live in spain myself 

253.74 254.28 B: minimal 

256.50 256.98 B: (( oh )) 

258.06 261.55 A: every time that i've been in (( barahas )) airport in madrid 

261.82 262.40 A: there's 

262.02 262.49 B: mm 

262.64 267.49 A: as far as i can remember there's been really no sort of of 

268.15 272.86 A: real security at all we'd walk through the whole check points and that would be it and 

272.39 273.00 B: oh yeah 

294.22 295.56 A: to join in 

295.80 301.84 A: for the whole security thing to work as it should 

302.23 307.29 A: but how other countries are doing it besides spain and france (( which of them )) 

307.40 313.20 A: two countries i've flown back and forth too i don't really know how much it's working 

313.32 313.90 A: so 

315.56 316.28 B: i don't either 

338.99 340.27 B: i tried to talk my shoes off 

340.75 341.21 A: really 

341.49 345.63 B: yeah the airport here in phoenix there there regularly making us take our shoes off 

345.87 346.57 A: okay 

346.24 346.66 B: so 

346.81 349.31 B: but two or three time since september eleventh 

350.25 350.71 B: yeah 

358.65 361.14 A: but they do it here so 

361.56 364.49 A: i don't know 

363.12 363.65 B: yeah 

365.57 370.82 B: what about in talking with other people have any of your friends commented people who do fly a lot 

371.18 372.90 A: um 

373.54 375.34 A: truthfully other than that 

384.53 394.99 A: from latin america and and they never really seem to comment very much on on any security measures that have been changed 

395.43 396.84 A: and so 

405.41 407.93 A: searched when she she 

408.06 416.24 A: arrived to philadelphia from madrid other than that i've not really heard many comments at all 

416.30 416.81 B: mm 

422.49 432.49 A: what they're suppose to be or if it's a random thing and all of my friend have happened to go through when it wasn't time for it to happen i don't know actually 

432.75 433.47 A: but 

434.13 437.85 B: i don't either you want to believe like i said theoretically 

438.39 445.02 B: if they are heightening security that they are going to be catching more people but the facts don't seem to be proving that 

445.04 447.93 A: right and 

448.09 449.86 A: and i don't know i just 

450.00 450.96 A: i just 

451.61 453.94 A: i don't know i just have a very 

467.22 469.49 A: see what's going on the airports and 

470.11 476.74 A: and so forth so maybe if i had more information then maybe i could make a better judgment but 

476.86 477.75 A: but 

477.95 479.56 A: i honestly don't know 

480.05 482.15 B: yeah i don't either i don't know how to 

483.59 484.03 B: how to 

486.19 490.70 B: how to really react to that um what about things like um 

488.23 488.93 A: right 

490.85 494.22 B: more security guards in the airport then martials 

494.45 495.65 B: who are in the airport 

496.12 497.00 B: between fights 

497.79 498.86 B: what do you think about that 

499.00 499.72 A: um 

500.33 510.24 A: from what i've seen at least here in columbus there seem to be more guard especially standing around the the 

517.35 522.81 A: about um and the fact that not everyone can go through to the the um 

523.40 524.17 A: um 

525.24 535.03 A: where you have to board the plane to my family's not able to go back with me to board the plane if they're not flying with me i think that's a good thing um 

532.86 533.50 B: yeah 

534.95 535.72 B: oh you do 

549.76 553.19 A: people are not aloud beyond that point them 

553.30 555.80 A: possible i don't know if this is true but maybe 

555.91 565.96 A: possibly um that would cut down so risk of some sort of terrorist attach or some sort of wrong doing 

564.67 567.65 B: people passing yeah passing items or 

566.16 566.91 A: (( with them that )) 

567.40 574.29 A: right within the airport terminal so i think that probably does have a positive point so 

575.86 576.80 A: but 

577.36 583.63 A: i don't know other than that i really don't see many changes at all i really don't see many changes at all and at least in the airport here 

577.63 577.98 B: uh 

583.90 585.12 A: um 

585.91 590.47 B: uh yeah the the shoe thing is the big deal here in arizona in phoenix at least 

586.47 586.89 A: but 

590.60 591.15 B: um 

590.93 591.37 A: mm 

591.79 594.93 B: and making people take there shoes off all the time and it's i'll 

595.35 600.12 B: checking people carry-on luggage seems to be as random as it ever was 

600.42 600.95 A: right 

600.44 603.06 B: there not there not doing it with any greater frequency 

610.55 615.12 A: at all either before the september eleventh or after and and 

615.25 618.60 A: i've only seen a few people and only one of my friends said that 

619.23 622.96 A: that it happened to her so it seems to me that a very 

623.31 625.42 A: random happening 

625.86 630.39 A: right um maybe it's the go head 

628.66 629.12 B: what 

630.57 636.94 B: what has happened when you came back into the country when i came back in from spain the really 

637.70 645.27 B: they two of my bags they tagged and they wanted to look through them a little bit but it was more for like customs it wasn't 

645.55 647.75 B: security stuff at least that's what they said 

647.98 652.31 A: right so things you had had planned on your customs documentation 

652.12 654.23 B: no just like i had um 

654.64 662.41 B: oh i had a bottle of something that was in like a metal tube and they couldn't really see i guess maybe that is security they couldn't really see what it was it was a bottle of 

659.30 660.04 A: okay 

661.78 662.47 A: okay 

663.39 663.81 B: so 

663.44 665.27 A: right um 

671.05 671.65 B: yeah 

675.83 676.39 B: yeah 

676.40 678.21 A: i've never been checked for that at all 

678.78 679.28 A: um 

679.71 688.65 A: the times that i've come back from europe i 've flown into new york new ark and into atlanta 

700.08 701.61 A: anything of the sort so 

702.56 704.24 A: so i don't know 

702.89 706.23 B: i hadn't either until this time it was interesting 

705.70 711.44 A: maybe maybe the next time i go it will happen to me who knows but
