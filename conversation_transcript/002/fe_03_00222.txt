13.45 14.54 B: this is the first one i've done 

14.73 20.59 A: o._k. it's sort of hard to like just think on the spot about answers to these things i'm like oh man i should have been studying on the 

20.84 21.73 B: right 

21.21 22.26 A: like little web page 

22.41 22.72 A: but 

23.54 24.18 A: um 

24.82 28.57 A: i guess it's sort of a relevant topic for me because i'm getting married next fall so 

28.13 29.26 B: oh uh huh 

29.59 30.27 A: um 

30.73 31.84 A: i don't know i guess like 

32.50 36.20 A: general compatibility is something to look for in a life partner 

35.41 37.42 B: sure 

37.58 38.35 A: um 

39.36 40.31 A: i don't know i guess 

43.04 43.53 B: uh huh 

44.81 45.48 A: goals 

50.15 50.57 B: right 

52.94 57.30 B: i'm actually recently married within um 

58.25 59.80 B: uh just over a year now 

60.33 63.99 B: so this is kind of relevant to me too um 

64.81 69.49 B: let's see things you should look for in a life partner life partner um 

70.96 73.25 B: i think most of what you said probably makes sense 

80.39 83.75 B: that someone treat you the way that you'd like to be treated 

88.62 89.07 A: yeah 

90.37 91.74 B: so you know that helps 

94.64 95.63 B: avoid a conflict if 

102.76 104.01 B: (( )) 

107.31 108.07 A: oh my 

110.42 110.84 B: because 

111.75 112.15 A: i guess 

112.70 114.23 A: (( those are yeah )) the important things 

117.75 118.13 A: yeah 

120.79 121.87 A: yeah i guess it's like 

122.76 123.28 A: sort of a 

124.50 126.44 A: lucky thing too i mean like 

127.10 129.35 A: you've kind of like managed to meet the right person 

129.22 129.82 B: right 

131.40 132.39 A: makes a difference 

132.80 135.40 B: luck is a factor in there um 

135.97 138.18 B: that's true another thing i was thinking uh 

138.35 144.40 B: when i got married one thing the minister said which i think is true for a lot of people is uh 

144.70 149.52 B: you might not be the right person at the moment and uh 

150.29 151.75 B: it's kind of like what you said about 

152.84 153.56 B: meeting the right person 

157.38 158.34 A: yeah definitely 

158.21 159.16 B: for both people 

163.13 164.08 A: yeah i mean i guess there's like 

164.65 166.45 A: flexibility too i mean so you can 

166.82 168.41 A: adapt and change and 

169.13 169.51 B: right 

169.25 171.44 A: grow and those are the things that will make you 

171.81 172.73 A: compatible in the long run 

173.04 173.42 B: right 

176.53 179.17 A: yeah willingness to make changes and that sort of thing 

179.81 180.86 A: a nice quality for 

181.31 182.14 A: both people to have 

182.62 183.38 B: i'm sorry what was that 

183.48 184.19 A: like a nice 

184.49 185.72 A: quality to have is 

185.57 186.06 B: oh 

186.02 186.27 A: like 

187.12 188.57 A: be willing to make changes and 

188.75 189.35 B: compromise 

188.95 190.67 A: adapt as yeah time goes on 

191.49 192.03 B: sure 

195.61 196.73 B: um 

202.59 208.25 B: i think that's about it also oh it seem so simple 

204.37 205.19 A: i know 

205.34 211.14 A: i (( )) i'd rather have topics like you know explain blah to the other person 

211.54 213.51 A: these are the things that are like hm 

214.30 215.08 A: yeah there's not like 

215.23 216.88 A: tons to disagree on 

218.75 221.61 B: uh eventually i guess um 

223.94 229.01 B: yeah i don't know i don't know what else to say which seems weird because this usually seems like a 

229.15 232.21 B: very complicated issue for a lot of people 

231.25 232.54 A: yeah i guess so 

233.25 234.94 A: yeah i guess all this is sort of like 

236.92 238.10 A: personal so 

238.60 239.04 B: mhm 

239.20 239.83 B: that's true 

239.34 241.10 A: every all kinds of little things are just 

241.50 243.59 A: relative to you in particular so 

244.88 247.89 A: it's not like the best small talk topic 

245.83 247.28 B: oh for each individual 

248.39 253.95 B: oh i see what you're saying 

254.92 255.80 B: um 

263.30 266.11 B: now what do we do 

266.09 267.21 A: i don't know i guess 

266.56 268.06 B: does it normally end at a certain time 

268.60 272.25 A: um i don't know i think they want you to try talk for like ten minutes but 

272.15 272.72 B: holy cow 

272.81 273.48 A: i think if it 

273.91 274.17 A: just 

274.40 277.29 A: isn't possible you can kind of give up 

277.76 279.36 B: has any of the conversations you've had 

280.82 281.52 A: um 

281.77 283.75 A: no yesterday i was talking about 

284.55 285.70 A: holidays and like 

285.84 287.42 A: that was sort of a stretch too it was like 

288.09 290.59 A: if you had to make up a holiday what would you make up 

291.18 291.65 A: it was like 

292.83 293.27 B: oh 

293.25 295.09 A: great ideas on the spot so 

293.42 293.95 B: i see 

294.68 298.94 B: you got to be creative see i thought you'd more like this would be more like uh 

300.00 300.86 B: (( )) type thing 

301.36 301.94 A: yeah 

304.11 305.71 B: use your imagination 

306.32 312.56 A: this is (( where they try to )) like judge how argumentative you are when you fill out that little online form 

315.41 316.31 B: um 

319.52 321.88 A: so you've been happy with your life partner choice so far 

321.10 324.46 B: yeah i think it's been great i actually saw 

325.07 327.79 B: um i th- i knew it would work out but um 

328.70 336.06 B: we both agree that we both thought even about circumstances it would be harder than it's been we thought 

335.02 335.45 A: uh huh 

336.27 337.84 B: that it's been pretty much a blast 

338.21 339.43 B: um 

340.02 343.66 B: we were saying everyone should do it everyone should get married um 

344.29 344.99 B: but um 

347.38 356.29 B: yeah so i guess maybe that's part of my difficulty is i'm pretty happy so like i haven't thought about um 

356.57 360.52 B: what i look for in someone i guess i've found it 

360.32 361.31 A: yeah exactly 

365.72 370.67 B: exactly maybe some uh horror stories 

366.56 368.23 A: little laundry list of 

369.59 370.60 A: exactly 

376.71 383.43 B: (( do i have other wisdom )) that could be part of it too 

392.40 394.27 A: sort of exhausting it 

403.88 409.91 B: yes that's pretty much it i don't really have anything else to say are you all set 

407.97 408.93 A: i know 

411.38 411.78 A: well 

411.98 412.59 A: i guess 

412.86 413.85 A: that's all for now 

413.41 415.16 B: are we supposed to just hang up now 

414.69 417.82 A: yeah i think we just hang up that's what i did yesterday and i think it's fine so

419.28 419.72 A: that's my 

419.98 422.74 A: guess yeah they don't really come on the line and tell you anything so
