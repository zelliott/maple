50.48 55.08 A: so have you actually changed anything in particular have you made any changes because of 

55.49 56.41 A: september eleventh 

56.71 57.25 B: um 

59.50 59.80 B: (( )) 

60.22 63.51 B: well the one thing that changed with me is uh i was a senior in college when it happened 

63.54 63.94 A: uh-huh 

64.18 64.92 B: and um 

65.74 69.05 B: it was had had i been a freshman i would have enlisted in to the army 

69.33 69.83 A: really 

69.85 72.21 B: yeah there was no doubt about it but you know i mean 

72.31 72.68 B: i had 

73.00 77.11 B: was just about to you know probably end up getting engaged and had already kind of 

77.69 81.67 B: set forth on another path but had it been a couple of years earlier i would have enlisted 

81.75 82.21 A: mhm 

82.44 82.88 B: um 

83.72 85.33 B: but the real changes didn't 

85.74 86.86 B: i don't think i changed 

87.18 88.50 B: too much until 

88.87 91.08 B: this this year is when it affected me more 

92.91 94.86 B: a composition class at a university 

95.55 95.91 B: and 

95.56 97.50 A: and has the subject come up a lot 

97.51 100.66 B: uh um it did well i actually taught on september eleventh 

98.42 99.85 A: you know as a writing topic 

101.02 101.58 A: wow 

101.82 102.38 B: um 

102.51 104.11 B: this year so it was really 

104.18 106.05 A: what age students it was at college level 

106.10 106.47 B: yes 

106.58 107.03 A: okay 

107.16 108.06 B: yeah there were 

109.15 110.96 B: almost everyone is eighteen so they 

111.34 114.39 B: were in high school at the time so that that was when it affected me the most 

114.64 115.10 A: mhm 

115.14 116.35 B: and that i kind of 

116.57 117.21 B: looked at 

117.41 119.01 B: life's a little bit more differently 

119.15 119.65 A: mhm 

119.65 120.55 B: seeing that 

121.48 125.13 B: the fear that some of my students had that i didn't have quite that much fear 

126.02 126.66 B: but um 

127.79 133.92 B: it really made me think about other people and how other people deal with situations verses how just how i personally look at situations 

134.23 134.75 A: yeah 

136.63 140.17 A: yeah i i mean it hasn't changed anything for me in terms of 

140.29 142.50 A: you know where i travel or what i do 

142.56 142.98 B: mhm 

143.32 147.71 A: now my feeling is that that is exactly that that is the intention of that type of act 

147.97 148.36 B: right 

148.58 150.82 A: and and you know i don't want them to succeed 

151.71 152.63 A: and um 

154.24 155.58 A: i i think yeah i 

155.90 158.79 A: i guess the other thing is i i definitely watch people 

159.61 161.46 A: more you know there is a certain 

161.43 161.93 B: right 

161.58 165.64 A: i wouldn't call it paranoia but i think everybody has an awareness 

165.93 168.60 B: right you kind of realize that people out there 

168.66 169.17 A: yeah 

169.08 173.36 B: my mind would never work that way to ever do something like that so it wasn't a possibility 

171.83 172.28 A: yeah 

173.66 177.13 A: and now i i think it makes people think a lot more about their mortality 

177.33 177.84 B: oh yeah 

177.93 180.90 A: you know a lot of people have changed their lives um 

181.70 185.51 A: again i i don't really think much has changed i haven't changed much but 

186.18 186.72 A: um 

187.83 191.00 A: i've seen a lot of people for example moved out of new york 

191.86 195.06 A: um actually my sister in law worked down there 

195.16 199.76 A: um not in the trade center not in the towers she worked at seven world trade center 

199.98 200.38 B: okay 

200.39 201.98 A: and she actually um 

202.47 203.35 A: they were they were 

203.54 205.22 A: displaced so to speak but 

205.77 208.56 A: she immediately looked for other work and 

208.94 210.86 A: and now she works in connecticut 

211.58 214.02 A: -cause she didn't want to come anymore that freaked her out 

215.22 215.68 A: you know 

215.81 218.81 A: just seeing everything there you know in person 

219.45 220.70 B: yeah well when i went 

220.94 225.97 B: i went to new york city last march um my family is from long island and 

223.48 223.93 A: mhm 

226.31 226.77 B: um 

226.87 228.10 B: my aunts live in the city 

228.37 230.12 A: oh so it definitely hit home for you 

230.04 233.89 B: yeah i mean i knew a couple of people that were um paramedics that were 

234.50 236.54 B: in the (( )) you know trying to save people 

236.91 237.84 A: did they escape 

237.03 237.36 B: and 

238.22 239.69 B: eh yeah everyone that i know 

239.93 240.59 B: survived 

241.19 241.61 B: um 

242.53 244.93 B: so it didn't affect me in that manner but that 

245.68 248.33 B: the fear of it that day of not knowing where 

248.43 250.12 B: you know people that you care about are 

250.10 250.53 A: mhm 

250.78 251.40 B: that was what was 

251.62 253.14 B: you know the most difficult that day 

254.67 256.03 B: but when i went out there 

256.43 257.73 B: back in march it was very 

260.22 261.74 B: it it that is when it hit home to me 

262.17 264.66 B: because it when you saw it on t._v. i didn't you know it 

265.22 266.76 B: i couldn't get the real effect of it 

267.07 267.48 A: yeah 

267.29 268.17 B: and i mean the 

268.49 271.29 B: the towers were one of my favorite things since i was a little kid 

271.43 271.86 A: yeah 

271.61 274.74 B: about new york city i had i'd always every time i went to see my aunt you know we went 

274.87 275.50 B: past the towers 

276.29 278.75 A: oh and i mean how many movies opened with that 

278.92 279.53 B: oh yeah 

279.33 281.03 A: being you know flying in to lower 

281.48 283.58 A: the southern tip of manhattan you know 

285.06 287.71 A: it is it is unbelievable i mean just the size 

287.83 290.81 A: you know people a lot of people don't realize how huge 

291.44 293.84 A: you know in terms of ground coverage 

294.06 296.15 A: not just how tall but the ground coverage 

294.08 294.43 B: right 

301.04 302.28 B: even you know i never went 

302.51 304.47 B: to ground zero when i was there but 

305.25 307.91 B: i don't think i that is i think i could never have handled 

307.91 308.79 A: (( a touchy sub- )) 

309.44 310.30 B: mhm 

310.07 315.61 A: some people are dying to go down the tourists it is a huge tourist attraction which to me is kind of odd 

315.79 316.79 B: yeah agree i just 

316.33 320.43 A: it is like it is like staring a car accident with a dead body or something 

320.58 321.88 B: right right you are 

323.27 326.46 B: spending your money to go see something which so many people have lost their lives 

326.53 327.28 A: sort of 

327.64 332.91 A: i don't know uh but at but at the same token you know they need the tourism here to keep the city alive 

332.89 333.32 B: true 

334.14 336.28 A: they are they are having i i don't know if you are aware of it but they 

336.45 339.77 A: they are having a horrible financial situation here 

339.53 340.70 B: yeah my aunt was telling me 

340.52 345.10 A: yeah they went from this tremendous surplus and now they are just at an incredible deficit 

345.78 348.86 A: so you know they are really going to need to rely on that tourism 

349.85 352.15 A: so how about the patriotic element 

352.81 353.87 A: afterwards 

354.44 357.19 A: you know do you have american flags on your car or 

357.03 359.48 B: um i don't have -em on my car but 

357.30 358.42 A: anything like that 

360.26 362.46 B: i grew my dad um 

363.28 368.79 B: just missed going to vietnam both of my one of my grandfather's was in world war two the other one was in world war one 

369.17 369.79 A: wow 

369.33 370.06 B: and so 

370.23 374.31 B: growing up i was always taught to be patriotic but i never really was 

372.50 372.89 A: right 

374.42 377.06 B: unfortunately um but i- that is 

377.35 378.67 B: that is you know the fact that 

379.02 380.42 B: me of all people and 

380.87 383.48 B: i'm not an overly athletic you know 

384.19 386.09 B: type of person but that i would've 

386.61 388.22 B: been willing to have to 

388.66 390.70 B: go through all of the training to be in the army 

390.69 391.10 A: mhm 

392.61 394.17 A: you felt that passionate about it 

394.23 394.85 B: oh yeah 

395.78 396.35 B: yeah that is 

397.48 405.38 B: you know i just i wanted to to make a change i wanted to prevent it from happening again and if it meant that i had to go in to the army or in to the air force that is what i was going to do 

404.96 405.40 A: mhm 

405.56 408.11 B: yes it had been uh you know a different time 

408.06 408.56 A: mhm 

410.54 415.03 A: i noticed there is so so many people with flags all over their cars and things 

415.78 416.57 A: and um 

418.88 420.48 A: you know at first thought it was i- it 

420.65 430.14 A: nice i mean i do think it is nice patriotism anywhere i mean you know nationalism is a nice thing people believe in you know their community that's essentially what that is 

422.37 422.81 B: mhm 

424.27 424.81 B: oh yeah 

429.96 430.48 B: right 

430.52 431.38 A: but um 

433.15 435.65 A: i felt like it's gone so far overboard 

435.86 442.84 A: and that um every clothing line you know ralph lauren everybody has red white and blue 

438.84 439.62 B: yeah 

442.94 443.75 B: mhm 

443.75 444.50 A: um 

444.91 448.45 A: jewelry stores have red white and blue you know real tacky stuff you know 

448.11 448.92 B: uh yeah 

448.97 456.80 A: um y- for your cell phone you can get you know stars and stripes covers i just got something in the mail saying um 

457.76 460.90 A: you can have your discover card in in red white and blue 

460.00 462.00 B: i got that one too 

462.03 464.90 A: you know you got that too and um 

463.20 463.87 B: yeah 

465.14 467.19 A: i guess my feeling about it is that 

468.03 473.86 A: it's it's already become um i don't know if i would say a cliche i i don't mean to sound bitter about it or like 

474.19 477.18 A: against it -cause i i love patriotism i think it is exciting 

477.28 477.85 B: mhm 

477.74 479.49 A: but i i feel like it is um 

482.29 490.17 A: you know how the christmas thing is commercialized so heavily i i feel like the patriotism has been pushed to that level too 

485.29 486.60 B: uh right 

490.30 494.19 B: right yeah i would agree i mean i don't know i'm assuming that it was an issue 

494.62 500.11 B: um out there the people that just would go and buy flags and they didn't know how to hang them and they were hanging them on the you know 

500.41 501.69 B: as stress signals 

501.80 502.91 A: oh yeah yeah yeah 

502.99 503.65 B: and 

503.82 504.74 B: you know that is i think 

505.32 506.06 B: where 

507.15 508.05 B: it truly you know it 

508.32 509.50 B: hit me that these people 

509.99 514.32 B: suddenly decide they want to have patriotism but they know nothing about our country or anything about our symbols 

513.15 513.59 A: yeah 

514.45 515.69 A: interesting point yeah 

516.98 519.96 B: -cause i actually uh had uh i live in an apartment i had a neighbor that did that 

521.00 523.62 B: got a bunch of people quite upset 

523.10 525.84 A: yeah my brother had one my brother is in the navy 

525.67 526.07 B: mhm 

525.93 529.09 A: um he is actually i think in clearview illinois which is kind of near 

529.37 530.63 B: oh yeah it is not that far 

529.70 530.49 A: near chicago 

531.07 531.87 A: and um 

532.08 534.82 A: his neighbor on the military base 

535.17 537.72 A: across the street had it hung upside down 

538.40 541.01 A: but again i i think um 

542.22 552.13 A: you know their interpretation was a sign of distress i think they were doing it as a sign of emotional distress you know that that we are at war this is an emergency 

548.33 549.01 B: mhm 

552.12 552.76 B: right 

552.75 555.87 A: when in fact it is supposed to mean like you know our ship is sinking 

556.11 557.05 B: right 

556.37 559.17 A: you know come help us before we drown 

558.98 561.75 B: right yeah there was actually an article in um 

562.19 564.37 B: the paper from the town i'm from that 

565.02 569.59 B: they had you know pictures of all these different people that had hung their flags incorrectly and 

569.26 573.15 A: kind of this way is right that way is wrong 

570.52 573.07 B: i mean that was like a big headline for us 

573.29 573.85 B: mhm
