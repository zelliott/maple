102.13 103.62 B: [laughter] 

103.11 110.41 A: but i realized too not only the importance of the flag but after that um 

110.45 114.28 A: a big article in the paper came out saying you know there are veterans 

114.35 123.17 A: all the time that have these flags from like a zillion years ago and that's awesome but you also have to make sure that you're respecting the flag in a way that

122.03 122.91 B: oh 

123.23 127.58 A: that you're not flying a a tattered flag you know that kind of thing so

134.51 135.56 B: um 

136.42 141.77 B: [lipsmack] i wouldn't say i really made any changes to my life um 

142.18 145.92 B: i think i was conscious about the mail for a while i thought that was 

145.75 146.82 A: you what 

145.93 151.54 B: [laughter] i was conscious about the mail because of that the anthrax um 

148.51 150.26 A: oh yeah yeah 

150.63 152.23 A: (( i kinda was too )) 

152.08 157.84 B: yeah but i didn't really do anything different with it i just was kinda [laughter] 

157.54 160.21 A: kinda looked at it a little longer before you opened it up 

159.59 167.03 B: yeah yeah i did and i i wondered if i i should be doing something but that kinda uh 

166.48 168.64 A: yeah i don't know um 

167.17 168.30 B: faded away 

168.93 171.13 A: i'm a college student so i 

171.36 173.56 A: i was real cautious about my email 

173.27 174.25 B: uh-huh 

173.94 175.29 A: i uh 

175.54 183.51 A: switched email accounts and things like that because there were a lot of viruses and things going along with all of that so i switched my email accounts 

179.54 180.61 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

183.64 189.12 A: and i was really careful who i gave my phone number and things out to like i used to have it posted up 

189.27 196.22 A: as like the signature on my emails so everybody who got an email from me would have my phone number and i was like oh maybe that's not such a good idea anymore 

191.02 191.97 B: right 

195.84 197.11 B: oh that's interesting 

196.49 199.53 A: that kinda thing you know and uh 

200.12 208.36 A: i i kinda feel like you do i don't know if i've made any drastically significant changes but i think i'm able to appreciate things a little more 

208.11 211.02 B: yeah yeah yeah i can i uh 

208.72 209.59 A: (( you know )) 

211.05 221.54 B: definitely i i'm sure as everyone did i did a lot of thinking about a lot of different things um i'm in new york state but i'm like three hours away so 

213.97 214.96 A: yeah 

216.44 217.35 A: yeah 

221.20 222.06 A: yeah 

221.49 234.70 B: [sigh] and i'm in a pretty small town really a small city so i think i still even though [laughter] i was- i'm not that far away i've felt far away from the real 

234.62 237.07 B: the real incident i didn't really feel like 

234.93 239.60 A: yeah have you been in to see the memorial or anything of that 

239.41 253.11 B: um not really um i've been there my brother lives in brooklyn and i went to visit him but um i didn't wanna ask him to like go there 'cause i didn't know how he felt about it [laughter] yeah so 

250.10 252.17 A: part uh-huh yeah 

252.59 255.11 A: yeah i feel like sometimes 

255.28 263.38 A: kind of like when you talk to people of older generation about the world war you know i feel like that's kinda one of these topics now or 

259.75 260.75 B: yeah 

263.43 264.93 A: where people either 

264.18 265.86 B: (( yeah )) 

265.06 267.98 A: want you to know about it or they don't wanna talk about it at all 

268.00 269.51 B: yeah [laughter] 

268.17 269.10 A: um 

269.50 275.25 A: [lipsmack] but i have to tell you i have heard this really strange thing on the radio the other day um 

273.96 274.85 B: uh-huh 

275.93 278.23 A: [lipsmack] you know it was just one of those kind of 

278.69 286.16 A: listen to this article this is weird they had run it in the newspaper that day where some lady um in new york who was a landlord 

285.90 286.77 B: uh-huh 

286.19 288.29 A: and she 

288.42 294.90 A: um there was a lady who had rented out an apartment from her who died like on september eleventh 

294.57 295.50 B: (( oh )) 

294.94 300.47 A: so they'll the tenant's family wanted to go back and claim some of her belongings out of her 

299.46 300.34 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

300.61 306.44 A: apartment well the landlord wouldn't let them in because supposedly the tenant didn't sign 

306.37 307.55 B: oh 

306.54 312.97 A: a permission form to say that they could come in before she like died i mean is that the stupidest thing or what 

309.60 310.47 B: yeah 

312.34 314.60 B: (( yeah she prob- )) 

313.47 314.36 A: so 

314.90 317.32 B: she probably had to worry about uh 

318.51 321.90 B: [noise] um the legal issues involved you know because 

321.31 324.77 A: oh yeah but still can you imagine being 

322.04 323.90 B: you know she lets them in 

326.10 329.33 A: being that family and not being able to go in 

327.37 329.21 B: yeah [laughter] 

329.23 331.06 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

330.43 332.80 A: i don't know that would've really upset me 

332.47 333.71 B: sure 

333.82 338.04 B: but she probably was worried about being sued or taken to court over it 

337.74 339.43 A: yeah that's true 

339.14 340.11 B: [laughter] 

340.04 343.65 A: um i also [sigh] have to say that 

343.76 344.72 A: um 

345.78 350.07 A: [lipsmack] oh i was gonna tell you something and i forgot [laughter] um 

349.09 349.78 B: [laughter] 

350.57 354.65 A: [lipsmack] oh i used to travel a lot and i don't travel 

355.21 362.14 A: as much anymore just because i don't have to but i do like to travel i definitely find myself being a lot more patient 

358.03 359.33 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

362.05 363.01 B: yeah 

362.31 364.95 A: you know going through and um 

364.23 366.27 B: oh yeah uh-huh 

365.56 366.75 A: i went 

367.53 379.30 A: out of town on chr- about christmas after september eleventh you know the security at the airports were just it was just tremendous but i have to tell you i flew [lipsmack] from chicago to atlanta to florida 

379.81 381.17 A: (( back to atlanta )) 

381.21 382.89 A: and back to chicago 

382.70 383.61 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

383.00 386.91 A: and not once did i get searched and i was like okay 

384.99 386.38 B: right 

386.95 392.58 A: (( [laughter] you know little old me but still i could have done who knows what you know )) 

392.18 393.62 B: yeah i 

392.99 399.51 A: but then my dad traveled the day after i did and he got searched every single place he went 

398.23 400.72 B: (( [laughter] )) 

399.65 403.67 A: and i was like huh they should like tag you once they've searched you that you're fine 

403.48 404.63 B: [laughter] 

403.95 404.87 A: you know 

404.98 410.06 B: i yeah i was curious about that myself like how they select the people because 

405.02 405.73 A: so 

410.30 420.26 B: um i haven't flown in a while now but um i did fly this past summer i think and i wa- i didn't think it was weird that it seemed like 

420.28 427.99 B: yeah they were searching some people and maybe more than in the past but really not a whole lot [laughter] and 

426.36 431.84 A: yeah and they were it was mostly they would kinda like oh all right you're fine you know i'm like 

430.51 432.47 B: [laughter] 

431.88 436.36 A: all right so i've got you know a nail file in my pocket you i don't know 

435.95 437.40 B: yeah you never know 

436.78 442.22 A: and i that same trip it was kind of odd i was flying with a bunch of guys from the naval academy 

441.82 443.31 B: mhm 

442.69 448.21 A: who were friends of mine and they're all you know in their naval dress 

448.09 449.05 B: (( oh )) 

448.22 451.19 A: i mean look oh there go all the navy boys you know 

450.87 451.91 B: right 

451.34 465.98 A: and of course out of all the people to search they search [laughter] maybe the like top ranking people that were there and he's like what the heck you know [laughter] i'm in the navy i work for you people why are you searching me [laughter] but it 

459.54 461.35 B: yeah [laughter] 

464.09 472.82 B: [laughter] yeah i don't know how they determine it if like the computer randomly picks and says search this person because um 

467.67 468.70 A: yeah 

470.24 471.18 A: uh-huh 

473.32 481.54 B: uh when i flew it's funny uh i saw a priest get searched on the way out and one got searched on the way back which 

478.98 479.80 A: yeah 

481.32 482.04 A: (( oh )) 

481.56 489.88 B: yeah anyone could disguise themself as a priest but [laughter] still i thought it was funny that out of all the people [laughter] 

485.28 486.14 A: yeah 

487.86 490.40 A: yeah it was very very ironic 

489.98 494.57 B: yeah i have a [laughter] funny dentist story about a 

494.72 496.61 B: (( [lipsmack] plane them searching )) 

496.62 500.30 B: um baggage and stuff is that before september eleventh 

500.24 501.12 A: uh-huh 

500.67 508.20 B: i had went to jamaica and on my way back i had [laughter] um an empty beer bottle in a 

508.05 519.99 B: luggage 'cause i was i just wanted to bring it back as a souvenir and they found it and they told me i couldn't take it on the plane that you can't take an empty beer bottle on the plane only a full one which [laughter] i don't know what the reasoning is 

509.15 509.90 A: (( yeah )) 

510.27 510.91 A: (( [cough] )) 

511.50 512.35 A: (( yeah i )) 

519.47 521.30 A: tell you what's the difference 

520.76 522.80 B: (( right [laughter] but um )) 

522.85 530.46 B: but i still am kinda amazed because i'm like how come the jamaican security could find an empty beer bottle in my luggage 

530.34 544.15 B: and like they couldn't find like the weapons these guys had and still people like are bringing [laughter] guns and stuff [laughter] it's kind of uh weird to me i don't i don't get that exactly 

537.42 538.81 A: yeah no kidding 

539.13 540.18 A: (( no kidding )) 

541.71 542.68 A: yeah 

543.58 550.74 A: and you always hear too i think this is so funny i'm sure there's like millions of reasons why they can't do it but the little black box in the airplanes you 

550.24 551.58 B: mhm 

550.98 558.69 A: know like why don't they make the whole airplane out of the black box stuff [laughter] you know people always say that and i mean i'm sure there's billions of reasons why you can't but well 

552.95 554.86 B: [laughter] 

556.91 561.69 B: (( [laughter] well it wouldn't fly [laughter] [laughter] um )) 

558.80 561.70 A: you think about it i mean come on [laughter] 

562.34 563.14 A: so 

563.61 564.60 A: i don't know 

564.43 569.10 B: from what i understand that black box always doesn't doesn't always make it either 

564.92 565.78 A: but uh 

568.49 570.62 A: yeah yeah that's true 

569.12 577.46 B: [laughter] but uh i always [laughter] i always used to have this idea of why don't they make 'em out of like uh inflatable 

570.88 571.53 A: (( that's )) 

571.86 572.54 A: true 

577.42 578.53 A: [laughter] 

577.52 581.95 B: [laughter] you know [laughter] 'cause i um 

581.84 592.89 B: i don't know if you've ever seen 'em but they usually fill like inflatable airplanes like at a fair or a carnival or something [laughter] and i always used to think oh why don't they make real planes out of this [laughter] 

588.04 588.93 A: yeah 

591.02 592.30 A: [laughter] 

592.41 593.70 A: (( ah that would be funny )) 

594.05 598.69 A: uh i do have to say though that that time during christmas and i was telling you i flew 

598.73 599.40 B: mhm 

598.79 605.49 A: um i consider myself to be a pretty open minded person and you know i'm friends with all kinds of different people 

605.54 612.11 A: but uh when the one guy on the whole airplane came on in a turban and robes 

611.89 612.82 B: (( you it )) 

612.13 615.85 A: and he didn't speak english i was like okay 

614.53 616.76 B: didn't make you nervous yeah 

615.88 620.45 A: but of course he he sat right down beside me and i was like hi 

620.50 631.33 A: if at all i was gonna be nice to this guy [laughter] so you know if anything happened he'd be nice to me [laughter] [noise] so but then he pulled out these books in a completely different language and i was kinda like 

631.50 638.25 A: okay luckily that was the flight that wasn't so full so i went to the bathroom and kinda sat down in a in a different part of the plane 

636.93 639.09 B: [laughter] yeah i 

638.25 647.06 A: i mean it really it really changed my perspective on things and i hated that because i hate to be that kind of person but i felt uncomfortable you know i really did 

641.11 642.22 B: right 

646.24 654.80 B: definitely i had the same experience and it that's pretty awful because it's basically like racial profiling [laughter] but you're like 

653.26 656.24 A: i see but how can you help yourself you know 

655.32 666.37 B: you can't 'cause you're the person on the plane and you're like well you know it's not like you say anything or do anything but you're kinda just more aware of what that person's doing because you're just 

664.79 678.55 A: yeah yeah but i did feel better though because he was the very last person on the plane which i knew it was a holdup because he had gotten searched so that made me feel a little bit better [laughter] so and i got home safe i [laughter] mean it was late 

668.40 669.74 B: [laughter] 

672.65 673.67 B: (( oh )) 

674.47 675.91 B: [laughter] 

678.99 680.75 A: so i don't know 

679.59 688.72 B: yeah that would be one thing i'd say has changed is when i flew like i was just more suspicious of everyone in general and just uh 

681.51 682.07 A: (( [cough] )) 

684.14 684.99 A: yeah 

686.95 688.03 A: mhm 

688.72 702.23 B: more observant but in my day to day life um obviously because i don't live in a area that is really a possible threat for terrorism well not likely so i just tough but mm 

696.26 697.18 A: mhm 

701.03 703.92 A: yeah well i have to say though even those people 

704.30 710.76 A: you know even the people that were there sure they think about it every day but it's not gonna be on their mind twenty four hours a day either 

710.63 711.52 B: (( yeah )) 

710.88 714.75 A: you know like even when something bad happens to me in my life 

715.21 717.85 A: i kinda get past it you know 

716.96 718.71 B: mhm 

718.09 719.89 A: and i'm sure you know
