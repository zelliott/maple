59.55 61.46 B: major values you can 

62.29 64.02 B: talk though anything 

64.75 65.80 B: um 

67.07 70.66 B: you know and you're both be looking at it from the same perspective most likely 

70.57 70.98 A: mhm 

71.47 71.98 B: um 

72.15 77.54 B: oh even if you don't look at it from the same way if you have similar views about openness and you know differences and all that 

77.93 78.34 B: things 

78.47 79.20 B: it's still 

80.21 81.66 B: still shouldn't be a problem 

82.05 84.30 B: if you have different opinions about things 

84.40 84.83 A: mhm 

85.43 88.72 A: no i i actually i think i totally agree with you on that 

88.96 89.40 B: yeah 

89.31 90.28 A: and i'm not sure 

90.41 95.38 A: i couldn probably find something better or larger or more ubiquitous 

95.51 96.74 A: that would sort of 

95.59 96.04 B: aha 

97.39 98.84 A: encompass like all the things 

98.98 108.49 A: that you would have to deal with with another like a life partner in the course of your life and yeah i would say if you do both have the same approach to life sort of in general 

108.64 109.18 B: right 

109.29 110.72 A: and those sorts of ah 

111.85 113.93 A: same sorts of things are important to both of you 

114.39 117.01 B: because a lot of people tend to say oh communication 

117.38 117.83 A: right 

117.55 120.10 B: it's most important and it is important but 

120.96 126.59 B: if you are c- looking at the world in two totally different ways you can c- [laugh] communicate about it all you want 

126.66 127.11 A: right 

126.74 129.62 B: but it's it's gonna be too big an issue i think 

129.32 132.87 A: yeah you'll just be able to better communicate your differences [laugh] 

132.56 134.90 B: or exactly [laugh] 

132.96 136.20 A: [laugh] no it's true it's true 

136.53 137.01 B: um 

136.60 142.89 A: yeah and i n- know i mean i think that yeah sort of big picture stuff ends up being more important than like 

138.72 139.17 B: [breath] 

143.04 145.12 A: even politics like you can be 

145.82 155.01 A: you know independent and democrat or republican and democrat and still have a lot of the same ideas about things just different ways of going about them and 

148.59 149.07 B: right 

150.47 151.59 B: [breath] 

153.08 153.81 B: right that 

155.65 157.60 A: you know that's i think where people 

157.79 160.09 A: get into big arguments it's where they are just 

160.99 162.44 A: fundamentally different 

163.08 165.13 A: places [laugh] coming from 

164.76 165.41 B: yeah 

165.43 166.00 A: yeah 

166.10 169.85 B: yeah the politics thing that's funny that's like my parents they've been ah 

170.08 171.55 B: cancelling each other out 

171.83 176.48 B: for years in voting because they have totally different views on that 

174.00 174.81 A: yeah 

175.20 175.87 A: [laugh] 

176.83 180.71 B: but you know they are still together after forty something years so 

176.86 177.45 A: yeah 

180.04 180.56 A: mhm 

181.06 183.08 B: are you married or in a relationship 

181.18 181.70 A: yeah 

183.13 185.91 A: yeah i have a a long time 

186.31 187.18 A: partner i guess 

187.18 187.70 B: aha 

188.21 188.99 A: yeah and i 

189.08 189.52 A: yeah 

189.80 190.20 A: maybe 

190.33 191.85 A: six or seven years long 

191.77 193.11 B: oh see so 

192.00 192.26 A: so 

192.88 193.38 A: yeah 

193.32 196.61 B: i assume you have the same views [laugh] life views 

195.39 196.32 A: yeah 

196.73 201.38 A: yeah i think that's a lot of it i think that's a lot of it and i mean 

196.91 197.86 B: [laugh] 

199.55 200.26 B: mhm 

201.69 204.19 A: i think probably secondary to that is 

204.78 205.10 A: to 

205.21 206.50 A: sort of be willing to 

206.60 207.47 A: compromise 

208.26 209.35 A: in certain things 

209.71 210.49 A: not you know 

210.59 213.00 A: your morals say but you know 

211.60 212.45 B: right 

213.56 219.66 A: sort of switching of and it i don't think works if it's just one person doing that it d- does have to be both which 

219.87 221.30 A: goes back to the initial thing 

221.36 222.18 B: exactly 

222.09 222.47 A: yeah 

222.94 223.45 B: um 

223.83 230.07 B: i was gonna something else haven't i oh another big thing although i guess if you have the same views it's 

230.26 231.10 B: isn't it

231.47 237.53 B: part of that is just having respect for the other person for who they are as an individual 

237.76 238.89 A: yeah absolutely 

239.74 240.81 A: sort of a general 

241.00 241.50 A: human 

241.73 243.26 A: person respect 

241.82 242.36 B: yeah 

243.31 243.74 B: right 

244.20 246.73 A: absolutely yeah i mean i don't know not to i don't 

244.76 245.04 B: i 

247.21 248.86 A: i try not to judge other 

249.45 256.34 A: couples or compare you know if you're you try not to do that compare your own relationships with people but 

256.49 257.83 B: it's hard not to though 

257.13 261.73 A: so it's what's other people have yeah it is hard not to though and a lot of times you see like 

257.98 258.86 B: [laugh] 

270.53 271.30 B: true 

271.15 279.08 A: a lot of times you notice like well off course there are problems there you know they bicker about everything because they just like to or 

275.75 276.34 B: mhm 

278.91 279.57 B: right 

279.19 282.81 A: you know they have a totally inegalitarian 

279.79 280.20 B: right 

282.92 287.33 A: relationship with one another and you know things like that yeah 

286.74 287.28 B: yeah 

287.79 288.85 B: well have you ever had 

289.01 290.81 B: fri- a friend she's ah 

291.09 295.95 B: gotten married and you just don't think that they don't belong with the other person they've chosen 

295.98 297.68 A: yeah absolutely 

296.67 297.00 B: and 

297.66 300.19 B: did you say anything or would you not 

300.70 303.33 A: yeah that's a really hard i mean i've had 

303.62 305.34 A: friends and relatives and 

305.92 307.57 A: geese all kinds of people i know 

309.01 313.73 A: but yeah it's been really hard to say anything ever and i've mostly never 

314.01 314.99 A: would have um 

315.22 318.61 A: mostly because my other friends beat me it and i saw 

318.44 318.95 B: oh 

319.38 321.41 B: well that's good [laugh] 

327.91 329.21 A: because all wrong and 

329.43 330.07 B: yeah 

329.67 341.00 A: you know we never though that you should even date him let alone now here you are now marrying him we don't want to come to the wedding because you know all this other business and she was just so hurt and crushed and i mean i 

336.13 336.61 B: ah 

341.56 343.88 A: she was like you know who cares if 

344.21 353.27 A: and you know at this point i was really glad i haven't said anything to her but you know she was just like who cares if i'm making a mistake you know i'm very happy and 

347.26 348.61 B: yeah 

353.51 355.95 A: i i really do think this is the right thing and 

356.18 359.84 A: if it's not well then you know i'm going to have to deal with it they're not so 

360.01 362.19 B: yeah that's a good point i feel like if you d- 

362.43 368.07 B: i don't know if you chose to say something you have to be very tactical about it [laugh] and um 

366.47 367.00 A: mhm 

368.80 369.70 B: also 

370.10 373.15 B: i wouldn't i would think not going to the wedding isn't like 

373.98 381.58 B: really su- i mean you should be supportive i think even if you don't disagree with the choice you should still be there to support your friends 

380.79 383.32 A: sure no absolutely i agree 

383.98 391.20 A: yeah i mean i i've never not gone to a wedding because [laugh] of that but yeah i mean it's a really tricky situation 

386.48 387.04 B: yeah 

392.33 394.60 A: it could be meddling and it could be helping 

394.74 395.56 A: you know ah 

394.92 395.62 B: exactly 

396.10 397.85 A: depending on the situation 

398.63 399.16 A: yeah 

403.93 406.23 B: have you done many of these calls so far 

406.13 409.56 A: no this is the first time i've ever done this actually 

408.41 411.07 B: oh it is this is my second [laugh] 

411.25 413.37 A: yeah i i wasn't really sure what to 

413.52 413.98 A: but 

414.21 414.73 B: yeah 

414.52 423.25 A: or like maybe the maybe the other person isn't really participating maybe she's playing linguistic games or something or no i don't know i don't know 

420.00 421.52 B: [laugh] 

422.41 425.79 B: oh oh now you got me thinking 

423.47 424.22 A: oh oh 

424.79 431.70 A: no no no no but i mean i know at u._p._e._n._n. they do a lot of they do a lot of sociolinguistics and stuff and 

430.64 431.14 B: mhm 

431.81 436.47 A: maybe you know i can't even figure out what it is they are studying exactly i'm i'm not sure but 

434.48 435.16 B: yeah 

436.56 437.81 B: try not to think about it 

437.64 443.19 A: yeah just have conversations with random people on topics that could be touchy or not 

438.06 438.89 B: [laugh] 

442.86 443.54 B: yeah 

443.53 443.96 A: you know

455.11 456.02 A: um 

455.48 456.36 B: definitely

462.41 462.95 B: mhm 

463.14 463.61 B: mhm 

464.10 467.34 A: it sounds so juvenile to say boyfriend

482.83 483.62 B: right 

488.28 488.89 B: right 

488.49 492.96 A: but we need to come up with a better word that boyfriend or girlfriend

495.91 496.42 A: you know 

496.59 497.05 A: i don't know
