18.32 19.27 B: correct i 

18.98 20.12 A: (( um )) 

20.54 25.15 A: like what do we desire in our life partner 

25.81 26.81 B: think so 

26.58 27.68 A: (( um )) 

27.70 29.40 A: well i for one 

29.63 33.45 A: think honesty is one of the most important things 

32.56 35.34 B: i was gonna say the same thing [laughter] 

33.91 38.68 A: [laughter] and definitely a sense of humor 

40.27 45.39 B: oh i haven't given much thought honesty and um commitment 

45.23 47.46 A: yeah that's very good too 

47.70 48.75 A: uh 

49.24 52.23 A: and of course it always helps if the person 

52.25 54.17 A: has a good faith 

54.49 57.66 A: it doesn't necessarily have to be the same faith 

57.73 62.10 A: as mine but he has to have some type of belief in god 

63.36 64.32 B: okay 

64.76 68.46 A: so i mean that's just my thoughts [laughter] what are your thoughts 

68.29 70.39 B: okay [sigh] a life partner 

71.89 72.88 B: (( [sigh] )) 

74.98 79.86 B: um well gosh commitment really is covers the whole thing 

79.22 81.29 A: mhm 

80.49 82.56 B: you know if he says something 

82.39 83.84 A: mhm 

83.13 85.25 B: he has to stick to it 

85.45 86.72 B: and um 

86.91 88.82 B: uh doing things together 

89.32 92.56 B: as well as allowing one to do things apart 

92.38 93.47 A: correct 

92.78 94.31 B: trusting each other 

94.20 95.37 A: correct 

95.05 95.92 B: that's it [laughter] 

95.98 101.05 A: well that's that says a lot [laughter] it um 

101.97 105.47 A: [lipsmack] there are so many different kinds of people out there that 

106.08 112.86 A: in order to find that one person that has all of these qualities [lipsmack] it's kinda hard to do 

113.67 114.74 A: (( um )) 

113.80 115.78 B: well if you're lucky 

116.03 117.53 B: it happens [laughter] 

116.96 125.86 A: right right luck plays a lot into it but then also i think sometimes when you have the same general 

125.96 128.74 A: oh what do i say um 

129.17 131.25 A: [lipsmack] type of things to do 

130.99 132.21 B: things in common 

131.79 133.09 A: yeah right 

133.55 136.18 A: that that always helps i think 

136.42 137.92 B: that's where it all starts 

137.66 139.09 A: mhm 

139.50 140.50 A: (( [mn] so )) 

141.19 145.11 A: oh let's see what else do we like in our men [laughter] 

143.87 146.89 B: well i think you just ah 

146.97 151.57 B: well you just grow together and the longer you stay together 

151.97 153.52 B: the easier it is 

153.40 155.16 A: mhm 

153.75 160.30 B: and um the more attached you become the longer you stay together if it's a life partner 

160.18 161.53 A: that's correct 

162.69 164.02 A: well it uh 

164.71 169.64 A: uh in this day and age there is so much oh how do i say it 

170.44 172.88 A: fastness about things 

172.93 175.07 A: yet some people don't 

175.47 176.92 A: put their 

177.76 187.25 A: [sigh] whole commitment in working things out and um toughing it out if if you go through a bad time 

187.25 188.32 B: that's right 

188.17 189.20 A: (( um )) 

188.52 190.88 B: so like they say it takes two to tango 

190.37 193.22 A: that's right that's right 

193.49 194.47 A: so 

195.58 196.87 A: um 

197.48 201.50 A: other than that i'm trying to think what else [laughter] 

201.41 204.15 B: what was the question again [laughter] 

202.68 209.56 A: [laughter] just life partners [laughter] but i'm sure we can talk about something else if we want too 

209.57 212.18 A: because we have given our general idea 

211.72 214.35 B: okay how how long are we supposed to do this 

214.24 221.07 A: uh they will they will let us know about a minute before the time is up it's usually about ten minutes 

220.72 223.00 B: okay how long have you been with your life partner 

223.12 226.59 A: uh actually we were married thirty eight years 

226.12 227.78 B: we've been thirty three 

227.49 228.85 A: oh right 

228.55 230.50 B: got a good match here [laughter] oh 

229.76 232.79 A: well good well mine passed away so 

231.98 233.40 B: i'm sorry 

232.93 236.88 A: that's all right it um i've got wonderful memories 

237.01 241.27 A: and that means a lot so um 

239.26 240.62 B: mhm 

242.38 243.97 A: and 

242.55 243.36 B: wow 

243.85 247.64 B: and my mother was married thirty eight years when my dad died 

247.17 248.32 A: uh-huh 

247.85 252.34 B: and then she remarried for twelve years 

251.65 253.73 A: oh okay 

254.12 255.13 A: (( yeah )) 

255.27 258.74 B: her her uh my dad's brother [laughter] 

258.19 259.95 A: oh how interesting 

259.41 260.22 B: yes 

260.10 261.23 A: (( well )) 

261.42 264.07 A: you know sometimes it is the closeness among 

264.46 267.25 A: you see these people you know 

267.43 269.58 A: more often than um 

269.97 272.46 A: and you get comfortable with them and whatever 

272.62 273.89 B: that's right 

273.36 276.31 A: i think that's one of the hardest things 

276.71 280.90 A: i'm finding out is to be comfortable with another 

281.78 285.48 A: person other than my husband you know 

285.68 289.33 A: because it's like you say you've gotten used to each other's ways 

289.05 290.06 B: mhm 

289.44 292.87 A: uh you can almost finish their sentences 

293.05 294.17 B: that's right 

293.71 294.92 A: (( um )) 

296.16 306.54 A: it's just a whole different ballgame yeah that's the way i feel now too uh he passed away two years ago 

298.03 301.05 B: i could not imagine finding another life partner 

306.83 309.99 A: and um i know some people that 

310.22 311.75 A: have remarried 

311.83 315.06 A: sooner than this but right now it just does not 

315.11 318.23 A: appeal at all you know what i'm saying 

317.85 318.96 B: mhm 

319.28 320.96 B: (( yeah mhm right )) 

319.48 320.52 A: (( you need a )) 

321.08 322.21 A: (( life partner )) 

322.40 326.69 A: you don't need someone just [sigh] to say you're married 

326.66 327.56 B: no 

327.26 328.27 A: (( you know )) 

327.94 329.05 B: mhm 

329.13 330.46 A: so uh 

331.03 333.51 A: well i think we did pretty good if we 

333.57 337.14 A: both got one for thirty years that's wonderful 

335.90 338.83 B: that's right that's right and it keeps getting better 

338.64 340.30 A: well wonderful 

341.12 342.34 A: yeah 

341.41 347.18 B: we're both retired and we just enjoy even more time together and we enjoy a lot of time apart 

346.94 348.71 A: oh wow 

349.07 352.68 A: so do you do some traveling then too or yeah 

350.70 355.23 B: oh yes yes we travel in a motor home and we've both 

355.67 357.54 B: like golf and 

357.62 363.18 B: i go and play volleyball and he goes and plays poker and [laughter] you know 

361.44 363.17 A: uh-huh yeah 

363.54 368.39 B: we just go our own way and we and we've and we're together a lot 

367.85 374.97 A: right yeah i see i know what you're saying you can be together but you have to each have your own little separate things too 

374.55 375.71 B: you have to 

375.42 377.76 A: yeah right it um 

377.83 380.10 A: especially if you're both retired 

379.92 381.24 B: right [laughter] 

380.59 388.13 A: you can't both be together the whole time it would just gnaw on each other you know and it would drive a wedge between you 

388.08 389.48 B: mhm 

388.57 389.97 A: so um 

391.08 395.84 B: i mean there's a lot of things that are so different we don't like the same television shows 

391.15 391.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

395.29 396.86 A: mhm 

395.88 397.85 B: we don't like the same food 

397.42 398.68 A: right 

398.03 399.92 B: but we compromise a lot 

399.55 403.73 A: why sure that that's part of it yeah that's uh 

402.85 406.94 B: and that's the trouble with a lot of kids today is uh the compromising 

406.74 408.62 A: mhm i agree with you 

408.10 409.47 B: they're selfish 

409.26 410.30 A: yeah 

409.61 411.27 B: as the generation 

410.90 411.94 A: mhm 

412.39 415.39 B: i think we brought them up that way [laughter] maybe perhaps 

414.05 415.06 A: well 

415.42 421.69 A: i tell you to be truthful about it i really worry about the future for the children and grandchildren 

421.21 422.34 B: mhm 

422.07 426.81 A: um i'm sure our parents did the same thing when we were growing up 

426.61 434.15 B: yeah but i'm like my kids you know i think they're they're more taken the more they mature they're more you know like like us 

433.78 434.92 A: (( mhm )) 

434.97 439.50 B: and um you know they're treating their children i think like we treated ours 

439.00 440.12 A: (( mhm )) 

440.18 441.30 B: and um 

442.31 443.88 B: that's not bad 

443.48 447.95 A: but there's always the scary thing that they could get into the wrong crowd 

448.25 453.63 B: they've done that been there done that and and passed it and then came out ahead 

450.08 453.12 A: yeah yeah that's hard 

453.33 455.55 A: yeah that's hard 

454.22 456.06 B: and was thankful for it 

455.78 456.88 A: right 

457.79 459.12 A: but uh 

459.32 460.70 A: there again 

461.16 464.27 A: having the right partner i think helps 

464.42 465.47 B: right 

465.55 467.36 A: you've got that base 

467.09 468.76 B: and you've got backup
