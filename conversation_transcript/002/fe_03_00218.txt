127.65 134.19 A: you know what did i like and why did this not work and that's what i don't want you know what i mean those things that did not work 

133.33 134.32 B: kind of analyze it

135.18 137.50 A: tend to analyze everything actually 

136.21 136.65 B: uh huh 

137.69 139.97 A: but i think that um 

140.95 143.73 A: for me actually my current boyfriend he 

143.85 144.57 A: and i have 

145.32 156.54 A: not much in common except the fact that we really like each other you know it's and it's it's actually very interesting that it works and sometimes i sit back and i go how did this end up happening 

148.44 148.85 B: yeah 

148.98 149.37 B: yeah 

155.91 159.24 B: well what happens when you're sitting in a restaurant the two of you 

159.82 160.86 A: what do you mean what happens 

159.85 160.23 B: well 

160.50 161.64 B: well what do you talk about 

161.95 162.79 A: what do we talk about 

162.78 163.21 B: i mean 

163.54 164.74 B: imagine 

164.90 165.99 B: doing that for 

166.39 167.70 B: for forty year thirty years 

167.80 169.29 A: yeah well i'm 

169.85 173.78 A: interested in things because he's interested in them and i like the fact 

172.51 172.95 B: mhm 

174.01 177.21 A: that he has different interests because it expands my horizons and it 

177.02 177.40 B: yeah 

177.37 178.93 A: expands the things that 

179.07 179.59 A: you know that 

179.77 181.34 A: i am interested in and i can 

180.94 181.34 B: mhm 

181.98 182.83 A: and also 

182.91 185.82 A: sometimes we think differently about things while 

186.27 197.12 A: somewhat on the same wavelength you know we'll differ just a little bit so he can give me some insight you know into what i'm saying and a new perspective and i think that's very important for me 

197.24 197.61 A: is 

198.10 198.63 A: to 

198.78 200.30 A: i need someone who challenges me 

200.24 200.90 B: yeah okay 

200.66 201.78 A: you know i i can't 

202.29 205.52 A: have constant reinforcement you know what i i mean like 

205.79 206.61 A: constantly 

206.85 209.90 A: telling oh yeah you're right you're right you know it's just that would 

207.92 209.97 B: right right yeah 

210.20 211.43 A: that would make me crazy 

210.71 211.85 B: have to disagree with you 

211.97 214.12 A: right absolutely he needs to disagree with me 

213.45 214.78 B: do you get into big arguments 

215.11 219.03 A: um actually not too often not not too often 

217.76 218.13 B: mhm 

219.76 221.16 A: only because 

221.32 223.52 A: i think that we can talk through those 

224.16 231.00 A: those things although maybe since i i'm a very assertive person and he's not so much and so maybe the fact that 

227.36 227.75 B: mhm 

228.32 228.70 B: mhm 

231.44 238.52 A: maybe it's not a big argument to me but maybe it is to him i hope not that that wouldn't be too exciting 

234.23 235.41 B: uh huh yeah 

237.80 240.42 B: a find it's it's really important to um 

242.05 244.11 B: be able to argue and to be 

244.21 246.74 B: able to stay with it and not 

247.60 250.14 B: have the person end communication 

250.40 250.84 A: right 

251.69 254.70 B: it's really important if you're going to be together for a long time 

255.60 257.44 B: to be able to 

258.05 259.27 B: always communicate 

260.16 261.04 B: and always 

261.43 262.49 B: have the other person 

263.33 267.49 B: willing to listen and willing to work through even though it may take a long time 

268.33 270.59 B: to work through something through something to just 

271.18 271.43 B: do it 

271.83 272.67 B: stick to it and that's 

273.40 274.89 B: really made a big difference in 

278.16 279.12 A: i think we're past 

279.64 279.89 A: that 

280.06 281.83 A: point where we think we are 

281.15 281.92 B: you're never past 

282.25 285.02 A: no well oh not that point not that point 

285.21 286.56 A: the point where 

286.68 287.67 A: when we fight 

288.68 292.69 A: you know i'm still a college student you know but we're past that point where 

290.29 290.63 B: mhm 

293.04 293.79 A: every fight 

294.26 304.58 A: you worry oh my god he's going to be break up with me you know it's not it's not like that you know so we're learning a little bit but you know i don't know i actually i also think that 

296.52 296.96 B: uh huh 

298.09 299.00 B: right right 

300.95 301.38 B: uh huh 

304.73 310.74 A: our differences get in the way as much as i appreciate the perspective and the differences and you know what 

311.15 311.44 A: that 

311.57 312.82 A: adds to me 

312.89 313.33 B: mhm 

313.06 320.49 A: myself it it's so frustrating (( )) sometimes he just doesn't understand you know but 

319.22 319.68 B: uh huh 

320.46 321.14 B: and never will 

321.19 321.66 A: yeah 

321.77 323.42 B: i there are lots of things i don't understand 

321.86 322.45 A: never will 

323.67 324.07 A: yeah 

324.33 324.71 B: i just 

324.96 327.07 B: i just don't understand and and 

327.74 332.18 B: i don't know that i ever will and my wife gets very frustrated with me that i don't understand it 

332.67 334.03 B: and i don't know these things 

334.16 334.85 A: yeah 

334.74 336.39 B: um and that i don't change 

336.65 339.37 A: yeah it's funny because i'm actually i'm 

339.49 341.25 A: one of those workaholic type people 

341.36 341.77 B: uh huh 

341.69 344.29 A: and he's very much a laid back person 

344.05 344.84 B: uh huh 

344.70 347.19 A: so i don't understand how he can be content 

349.54 350.33 B: mhm 

354.10 357.19 A: he doesn't understand how i can fill every moment of my day with 

357.30 364.56 A: lots and lots of things and it makes me happy he's like i don't understand you know and it's just we're 

362.92 363.58 B: yeah 

364.77 366.68 A: completely different 

365.16 365.58 B: funny 

366.43 370.27 B: i have the same thing i'm very i can it's not watching television but i can 

370.80 374.10 B: spend hours doing a very little thing just because i'm enjoying it and 

374.31 374.81 A: yeah 

375.13 378.78 B: or or not doing anything i can literally not do anything and be fine 

379.30 382.47 B: and she has to have something to do 

383.25 383.68 B: um 

383.97 384.84 B: and is always 

385.57 387.66 B: always doing something until she doesn't want to and then 

388.37 389.82 B: all of the sudden she doesn't want to do it 

390.19 391.77 B: and i'm stuck with wait wait a minute 

392.17 397.71 B: why are of the sudden are you relaxing and now i'm working you said we had to work and now we're all working and yet 

397.88 399.89 B: now you're done but i'm not 

399.44 400.29 A: yeah 

400.67 401.12 A: funny 

401.14 403.10 B: but it has to you have to get used 

403.20 404.48 B: to those 

404.67 405.63 B: patterns and 

406.25 407.51 B: those behaviors and 

409.73 412.18 B: it's interesting so do you think this life part- this 

412.34 414.91 B: this guy you're going out with will turn into a life partner 

413.55 413.88 A: mhm 

415.18 416.81 A: i'm not sure yet 

417.09 428.32 A: you know it's he's it's actually a long distance relationship and so it's it's one of those things where the time that we spend together is very condensed and so our relationship that's been going on for a long while 

420.64 421.24 B: uh huh 

428.21 429.15 B: how long has it been going on 

429.27 430.93 A: only about a year or so 

430.48 431.47 B: about a year okay 

431.04 434.06 A: a little bit longer than a year not too long and 

432.26 432.72 B: okay 

434.52 435.21 A: it's just it's 

435.30 435.64 A: it's 

435.98 440.30 A: it's has a weird dynamic to it because it's been long distance since the beginning 

437.73 438.16 B: mhm 

440.48 440.95 B: yeah 

441.04 449.97 A: so it's it's actually it's a really funny story but he actually lives and goes to school in a different part of the country then i live and go to school you know so 

443.80 444.21 B: uh huh 

447.92 448.37 B: yeah 

448.60 449.17 B: oh boy 

450.20 450.82 A: um 

450.72 451.51 B: well i've done that 

451.58 454.87 A: it's an obstacle it's it's it's a very big 

452.66 453.12 B: yeah 

454.70 456.78 B: i've had long distance relationships but they were more like 

457.33 459.00 B: two hundred and fifty mile relationship 

460.09 461.04 A: right well 

461.22 462.80 A: yeah i mean i 

462.91 470.47 A: get to see him probably about once a month so you know you you spend a month of your relationship in three days and it doesn't but at the same time 

468.24 468.60 B: mhm 

468.78 469.20 B: yeah 

469.47 471.64 B: and then on the phone and instant messaging and 

471.23 473.49 A: right right and so you know it's 

474.07 474.97 B: that's hard yeah 

475.29 475.65 A: yeah 

475.33 476.50 B: well at some point 

476.90 477.27 B: you'll 

477.83 478.37 B: either 

478.76 480.28 B: continue the relationship and 

480.43 480.88 A: right 

480.96 482.15 B: get together or 

482.72 483.82 B: or end the relationship 

483.73 484.19 A: right 

484.32 485.28 A: right you know 

486.20 486.93 B: how's 

487.16 488.97 B: one thing about long term relationships is 

489.49 490.73 A: long term or long distance 

490.62 491.50 B: long term 

491.40 491.84 A: okay 

492.39 493.79 B: or i guess life partners 

493.78 494.24 A: mhm 

494.38 495.77 B: is the idea of 

496.08 499.08 B: how many relationships have you gone through before you get there 

499.96 502.03 B: and some people get there right away some people 

502.54 503.77 B: never get there i know uh 

504.37 505.10 B: a guy whose 

505.60 506.80 B: constant- he's in 

507.09 508.97 B: he's very attractive too but he's never 

509.43 510.93 B: had a lasting relationship 

511.60 512.13 A: really 

512.20 514.18 B: i'm not sure why that is he's 

516.54 517.38 B: he's he's sort of 

517.50 518.64 B: independent and flighty 

519.28 519.92 A: okay
