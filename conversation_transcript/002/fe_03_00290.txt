0.16 1.46 A: hello 

1.03 2.85 B: hello this is doug 

2.58 3.93 A: hi this is linda 

4.71 5.72 A: um 

5.85 8.49 A: boy that's a hard question for me because um 

8.75 11.55 A: i actually have no clue whether it does or doesn't 

11.40 15.14 B: well i've done a lot of flying since since september eleven 

14.82 15.95 A: you have 

15.67 17.76 B: and i've seen 

18.01 21.80 B: an awful lot of people's toenail clippers confiscated 

21.14 22.58 A: mhm 

22.20 23.14 B: (( ah )) 

24.37 26.22 B: but 

26.32 31.00 B: i also suspect that the biggest change 

31.35 39.07 B: isn't a result of heightened security the biggest change is a result of a change in passenger expectations 

38.42 39.64 A: mhm 

40.06 42.78 B: ah in the old days 

42.98 43.87 B: (( ah )) 

44.87 53.45 B: after the rash of hijackings in the nineteen seventies the expectation was that if there w- if someone hijacked your airplane 

54.44 65.22 B: you were a hostage and they were going to take you to some airport other than your destination and then there would be some negotiations that might take a while but if everyone behaved nicely they'd all be released 

64.58 69.08 A: yes exactly and now that's totally the opposite yeah 

67.28 71.95 B: and now if someone were to start acting like a hijacker 

72.01 83.05 B: ah people would fear for their lives and do desperate things and ah i think it's that doing desperate things on the part of essentially all of the passengers that would 

75.70 76.77 A: yeah 

83.44 88.38 B: make that approach to terrorism pretty much a failure 

87.82 88.86 A: mhm 

88.67 89.65 B: (( ah )) 

90.71 94.85 A: i think that one one thing that i think is strange is that um 

95.17 98.32 A: only now and maybe not even on every airplane 

98.37 103.19 A: um that the cockpit and the past the cockpit has never been locked 

103.21 105.94 A: and sometimes the doors weren't even closed 

105.63 117.85 B: well i [mn] since september eleven i think more and more everything has been properly locked up up front during the flight once they land they open the cockpit door and the pilot smiles at everybody 

110.92 112.32 A: yeah 

112.45 113.74 A: yeah probably 

117.36 118.63 A: yeah 

118.12 124.00 B: but ah but during the flight things have been pretty locked up and i i one time that i 

121.76 122.95 A: mhm 

124.36 131.48 B: that i flew i'm pretty sure my seat mate was a federal air marshall ah he didn't say so but 

128.51 129.19 A: (( mm )) 

130.90 135.95 A: yeah but you if you could tell that's interesting probably a lot of other people could tell as well 

135.90 147.33 B: oh we'd fall into conversation and he'd been flying a lot and i'd been flying a lot and all it was only later that i realised that his pattern of flying a lot 

147.47 151.67 B: going out and back in one day from from from o'hare 

151.34 152.88 A: oh yeah 

151.87 154.30 B: didn't really match 

153.55 154.46 A: [laughter] 

154.50 157.18 A: the typical business customer 

155.92 163.27 B: well i mean there is a one can imagine certain government people doing that to for a brief meeting say at the pentagon or something 

162.68 164.01 A: mhm 

163.38 174.98 B: but in most cases people get overnights ah and and the idea that that he was spending essentially all day on the airplane it just struck me that the he was probably an air marshall 

173.02 175.59 A: yeah yeah 

175.01 179.29 B: and w- we were in the front seat i've frequently been assigned to front seats 

178.76 179.49 A: (( hmm )) 

179.47 180.42 B: (( ah )) 

179.79 181.70 A: do you fly a lot for your work 

181.57 185.70 B: ah not normally but the last two years i have 

185.01 190.32 A: yeah i have flown i haven't flown at all since september eleventh and as a matter of fact 

190.40 195.41 A: over my lifetime i haven't flown probably nearly as much as most people um 

194.31 195.09 B: (( mm )) 

195.90 204.72 A: and of course before september eleven a lot of this airline security was just kind of you know the the routine stuff that in fact i 

205.09 217.42 A: used to really wonder about it because you know you would go to the ticket counter and they would say are you carrying any guns are you carrying any explosives you know you'd say no and they'd say okay and it's like well why even ask that question it's absurd 

208.60 209.52 B: yeah 

211.46 212.40 B: right 

216.03 225.56 B: ah i know why they ask that question and the answer is that if you say no and then they catch you with a gun they've got you for perjury as well as a weapons charge 

223.68 228.52 A: [laughter] you really think that they'd need perjury if they catch you with a gun on an airplane 

227.34 232.09 B: i think it it's really helpful to have additional things to charge someone with 

231.06 237.49 A: oh because other than that there is no reason because obviously someone who is carrying a gun won't say so 

236.14 236.98 B: yeah 

237.12 251.63 B: it's also to remind people i mean if you the it's amazing the things people carry with them carelessly there's this guy who very shortly after september eleven was f- he was a chef and he was flying with all of his chef's knives 

239.12 240.24 A: yeah 

243.54 244.49 A: right 

251.71 256.51 B: and he thought they weren't weapons well to him they were the tools of his trade but but 

253.39 254.48 A: oh 

256.42 257.74 A: yeah 

256.79 258.06 B: this is a whole 

258.20 263.04 B: a whole carry on bag full of of of cutlery they 

260.71 269.02 A: right well then the question arises you know how do people like that get their things where they need them to go they have to ship them separately 

267.99 269.40 B: have to check them 

269.48 272.21 A: yeah okay yeah 

271.94 281.54 B: but the the just like firearms all you have to do if you're taking a rifle with you is check it and there's a lot of tourist trade with hunters 

277.25 277.97 A: (( mm )) 

281.65 282.84 B: where 

282.99 286.70 B: in fact i remember in the in the late sixties flying 

287.01 291.34 B: flying home for thanksgiving break flying to michigan from pittsburgh 

289.99 291.27 A: mhm 

291.45 294.74 B: and i was a student 

294.79 300.32 B: and i would frequently find myself sitting in front of or behind a pair of hunters who ah 

300.35 303.86 B: who'd been deer who were going to michigan for for hunting season 

303.02 304.30 A: oh really 

303.94 312.82 B: and back then this is before the fire before the hijacking issue it was perfectly reasonable for them to take their guns as carry on baggage 

312.86 313.68 A: huh 

313.84 315.01 A: yeah 

314.23 315.85 B: put it in the overhead bin 

315.20 318.27 A: and now that would probably be considered very odd 

316.23 317.54 B: [laughter] 

318.33 323.31 A: very odd if you even thought of taking it on a plane at all much less on a carry you know 

320.87 330.02 B: yeah deer rifles yes well no actually i ah people still check that kind of thing although they can't take ammunition 

328.06 328.76 A: (( mm )) 

329.74 331.42 A: right okay yeah 

330.45 341.74 B: but they can check firearms and and and considering the trade in hunters ah as a major part of the income during deer season for example for a number of states 

341.80 343.81 B: michigan and minnesota 

343.99 348.81 B: and and ah you know they'd love to attract deer hunters form ah 

348.82 354.08 B: from states that don't have deer ah they see it as a major source of tourist income so 

350.81 351.72 A: yeah 

353.49 354.57 A: yeah 

354.20 357.23 B: so there are a lot of hunters who who take weapons 

356.56 357.55 A: mhm 

358.16 363.41 A: well you know getting back to the original question i think that i think that i would probably feel 

364.62 367.70 A: that the heightened security given all 

367.67 371.35 A: given all the things that have gone on in this country and and all the 

369.75 370.62 B: yeah 

371.33 384.09 A: mistakes that the f._b._i. and c._i._a. have been mading making and everything i i don't feel especially convinced that what they're doing is really going to make a lot of difference i i sort of feel more like if someone wants to hijack a plane 

384.41 387.08 A: they're going to get it they're going to find a way to do it you know 

386.17 392.27 B: yeah but and also if someone wants to be a terrorist there are other ways to terrorize 

391.06 393.97 A: yeah well as you know they used you know 

393.99 395.75 A: box cutters for 

395.50 396.47 B: yeah 

395.80 399.42 A: weapons on that other plane which didn't get detected so um 

398.75 403.14 B: right and and if i wanted to ah if i wanted 

403.66 408.66 B: to ah to to commit some new act of terrorism i mean ah 

408.95 413.29 B: ah small bombs in crowded places 

412.68 413.78 A: mhm 

413.73 416.92 B: would be just as effective as sources of terror 

416.18 422.24 A: yeah and you also may be able to somehow either yourself or get someone else to have access to the 

417.02 417.91 B: (( ah )) 

422.26 424.25 A: airplane and and you know 

424.31 429.04 A: do something to it so that when it was in flight it was going to crash or something like that 

428.23 436.41 B: well but but those are those are secure now those are secure targets and there are so many other things where if i wanted to terrorize a society i'd simply 

435.18 436.21 A: yeah 

436.49 439.17 B: i'd simply pick some different thing 

438.71 440.26 A: exactly and 

439.24 444.65 B: shopping mall or a or a or a football stadium with a hundred thousand people in it ah 

442.71 453.12 A: with lots of people especially since now they've sort of got all the focus on airlines and and things and so they're going to go okay well while they're busy with that we're going to be quietly developing a new 

447.98 448.95 B: yeah 

452.98 453.91 B: a new 

453.19 454.62 A: method you know 

453.93 463.58 B: right and it it doesn't take much intelligence to pick new methods there's so many i mean any any complex advanced civilization has 

457.14 458.12 A: no 

458.70 460.43 A: there's so many options 

463.59 468.33 B: tremendous points of vulnerability and we we what is it we rely on ah 

469.60 481.99 B: we rely on on on the fact that the vast majority of people play by the rules that's what makes our society work and and when someone decides to go bizarrely against the rules things break 

476.59 477.92 A: mhm 

481.63 493.80 A: yeah yeah and there and therein lies that's the crux of the matter is that there is absolutely no way that you can protect yourself from any eventuality in the world you know there's just no way it's like someone 

491.29 493.07 B: right right 

494.00 494.89 A: um 

495.05 498.81 A: i was i was talking to a friend once who said that someone had sued 

498.84 502.52 A: a car company because their seatbelt had broken or something and um 

502.74 504.79 A: and he said you know 

505.01 511.84 A: you just can't you can't protect yourself from everything you know the world is fraught with danger i mean [laughter] that's the way it is you know 

511.30 512.75 B: right 

512.06 515.47 A: and unfortunately it's getting more and more that way it seems 

515.60 523.64 A: so that when you know raising children is you can no longer feel safe in telling them yeah you're safe i'll take care of you nothing bad will ever happen 

522.07 526.98 B: that's is is that just exaggerated sense of risk i mean there was a 

526.98 540.69 B: there was a piece of ah of email i saw recently from someone in israel responding to people from from outside of israel and he said how can you stand to live in a country where things are just so violent and so awful 

540.31 541.42 A: mhm 

540.75 549.87 B: and they pointed out that the ah the the death rate from traffic fatalities in israel is twice the death rate from ah from violence 

549.16 550.28 A: really 

549.85 556.78 B: yeah and so and the death rate of traffic fatalities you know people don't stop driving because of that 

556.18 557.99 A: yeah yeah 

556.74 566.72 B: and it's a question of putting risks in perspective that that we frequently because some risk gets a lot of publicity we exaggerate it all out of proportion 

566.10 568.58 A: yes that's very true yeah 

567.65 573.96 B: and if you put the risks in perspective you discover that a lot of common everyday things are are more dangerous 

573.43 577.11 A: yeah like smoking cigarettes or [laughter] 

575.44 580.33 B: if you if you're worried about explosion risks that you are likely to be faced with 

580.35 589.68 B: the ah gasoline tank trucks in the highway are the single greatest source of of of massive catastrophic fires in the country right now 

583.41 584.14 A: mm 

587.99 588.92 A: really 

589.00 592.07 A: well does that actually happen i've never heard about that happening 

590.90 594.03 B: oh there was a case that i remember in the 

594.19 605.69 B: in the seventies i was in colorado at the time a tanker truck ha- was involved in a traffic accident and caught fire in the middle of a freeway interchange in denver 

605.23 606.16 A: whoa 

606.12 613.95 B: and it was just an incredible mess those gasoline tanker trucks are really hazardous 

609.08 609.89 A: (( mm )) 

613.69 614.78 A: yeah 

614.21 621.31 B: and fortunately the accident rate is low but it's not zero and when they do have accidents it's not too hard to ignite the fuel 

617.52 618.17 A: (( mm )) 

620.96 622.52 A: yes exactly 

621.81 632.99 B: and it's be- but because it's a common thing we know those tanker trucks are everywhere we know traffic accidents are everywhere sure once in a while one of them will blow up it's not exciting news except locally 

632.26 633.66 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

633.26 634.18 B: um 

634.58 647.13 B: and it's quickly forgotten because it's a familiar risk not because it's not dangerous just because it's familiar whereas the same amount of chaos caused by by a a a 

637.61 638.60 A: yeah 

640.83 641.69 A: mhm 

648.45 652.50 B: some other less common thing ah that that the 

652.53 658.90 B: the truckload of of of spent nuclear fuel that has a traffic accident and no one gets injured 

659.13 663.73 B: and the fuel containers don't leak that'll be a front page news story 

663.15 664.20 A: mhm 

663.84 666.75 B: because it involves an unfamiliar risk 

666.56 673.26 A: yeah yeah and while the with an airplane also maybe you don't feel this way because you fly frequently but 

673.44 675.01 A: i i think that people 

675.43 679.52 A: tend to i tend to think of it as okay you're up there you're you know 

679.84 686.27 A: you're mi- you're a mile above the earth trapped in this airplane and if something happens you're you're a gonner you know 

683.08 683.97 B: yeah 

685.57 692.18 B: now that's that's the big difference between airplanes and driving and driving most accidents are survivable 

691.36 693.16 A: exactly 

692.12 706.23 B: and airplanes most accidents are not survivable on the other hand driving accidents are so common that it's an awfully good thing most of them are survivable because overall the death rate on the on in cars is higher 

694.84 696.00 A: (( yeah )) 

701.76 703.13 A: yeah 

705.77 712.73 A: right i think you also if if you're like me you feel like you have more control if you're the one driving the car than a 

706.39 707.36 B: ah 

711.68 713.57 B: yeah it's your fault 

712.79 715.59 A: you you have your own self to blame or something but 

714.57 719.90 B: yeah whereas with with an airplane accident you're you're you're an innoc- you're an innocent victim of airplane 

719.46 719.90 A: yeah
