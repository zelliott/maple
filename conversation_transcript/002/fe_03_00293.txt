58.08 62.14 A: um further what um uh do do you do you think that 

62.35 64.45 A: it makes us feel safer though 

64.58 65.19 A: do you think 

65.40 67.49 B: i think i think it does um 

68.04 68.79 B: i think 

69.12 70.34 B: i haven't traveled a lot 

70.65 72.90 B: um in the last year but i think for the most part 

73.46 74.43 B: people sort of 

75.05 75.46 B: are 

76.72 78.67 B: are more comfortable having 

78.78 79.89 B: some of the inconvenience 

80.52 81.16 B: knowing that 

81.39 84.35 B: at least on a surface level it makes things appear safer and 

84.78 85.67 B: and more comfortable 

86.06 87.29 B: but i'm not 

88.01 92.78 B: given that we don't live in a society like israel for example where it is the norm to do this all the time 

93.39 97.30 B: and that we're such a sort of fast paced technologically driven society um 

97.48 104.82 B: not convinced that we can maintain the level of security that we've got without either driving people crazy or just sort of get 

104.98 105.48 B: letting 

105.76 109.03 B: letting more laxness slip into it and and letting things slip up 

109.74 113.96 B: and then sort of having a repeat of the whole problem which is realizing things we should have been doing all along 

114.14 115.34 B: we we let slide 

115.95 117.61 A: i i yeah i think apathy serves 

117.90 120.72 A: seeps in to to what we do i mean at at 

121.23 121.60 A: (( )) 

121.84 124.73 A: i flew thanksgiving after september eleventh and 

125.10 128.81 A: you know everybody was on age and everybody was kind of like looking around at there 

129.18 131.71 A: there fellow passengers and then you know you've already seen 

132.25 132.73 A: um 

132.91 137.69 A: uh an awareness slip away from from the flying public and 

138.07 140.56 A: although we've seen security you know kind of 

141.30 142.91 A: uh stay the same 

143.09 145.04 A: it's obviously not the same because 

145.80 146.14 A: you know 

146.42 149.72 A: i don't get my bags used to be searched every time i went through 

149.16 149.47 B: right 

149.82 151.19 A: with the carry-on and now 

151.43 152.06 A: you know i 

152.76 155.03 A: i get searched maybe you know once every five 

155.45 156.95 A: what or so times i fly 

157.22 159.00 B: right exactly i mean i think i've been 

159.30 160.40 B: randomly searched once 

160.54 160.83 B: but 

161.54 163.21 B: you know it's not 

163.41 168.61 B: the logic behind it isn't entirely clear and sort of picking every fifth person i don't think is any more effective than 

169.05 170.63 B: you know picking every tenth person or 

171.00 174.92 B: just not randomly searching you know sort of the whole notion of randomness is that 

174.96 175.91 A: yeah 

175.57 177.77 B: not so likely to hit what you're going for 

178.78 179.66 A: (( )) 

179.78 180.36 A: but i think 

180.65 181.29 A: i think that 

183.57 185.82 A: i i i kind of agreed with with the the 

186.12 187.83 A: so- some of the airlines when they said that 

188.28 188.57 A: that 

188.67 189.17 A: (( )) 

189.38 192.19 A: well and i think i've seen on the news recently that 

192.72 193.65 A: they're bringing in 

193.75 194.76 A: like air marshals 

194.90 195.33 A: to 

195.77 196.55 A: random flight 

196.82 197.22 B: right 

197.53 199.84 A: that would be armed and and be able to take 

200.05 201.88 A: uh a terrorist threat or whatever (( )) 

209.80 215.93 B: made it through security at the philadelphia airport with a bag full of box cutters just to prove that he could and that security hadn't been 

216.12 217.07 B: stringently tightened 

217.84 218.67 A: i hadn't heard of that 

218.84 223.94 B: yeah so i mean which is a ridiculous sort of way to prove a point and of course he got in lots of trouble for it 

223.82 224.43 A: right 

224.09 226.82 B: but the fact of the matter is (( )) at that point where 

227.20 232.37 B: everyone was at their most frenzied and you'd think that everything would be truly clamped down you know it's sort of you know 

232.82 235.71 B: po- post-terrorist day you know fifteen or sixteen 

236.30 245.31 B: and he just walked right in she was like hi and he he announced himself you know he didn't he never got caught he made it all the way to the gate and then was like look what i was able to do 

245.90 246.19 A: yeah 

246.64 248.93 B: at which point they promptly arrested him 

247.15 247.89 A: yeah uh 

249.57 252.57 A: i kind of think that it's if we really want to go 

253.39 255.35 A: as far as we need to go we might need to 

255.46 257.54 A: i i i think that there are probably ways 

257.69 258.19 A: to in- 

259.95 264.19 A: insure that uh an airplane cannot be taken by terrorist force um 

264.38 265.12 A: uh i don't know if 

265.56 268.15 A: you know peo- people say that it's a safety hazard to have 

268.34 268.68 A: um 

269.24 271.31 A: like fully lockable and 

271.96 272.43 A: you know 

273.08 273.91 A: strong 

274.80 276.02 A: doors to the cockpit 

276.11 277.00 A: you know so that 

277.27 277.76 A: terrorists are 

278.05 279.07 A: cannot possibly 

278.46 279.54 B: can't get in no matter what 

279.88 283.43 A: uh i i think that would probably be a good think to do eh i 

283.89 284.34 A: um 

284.62 286.40 A: i think i had this this discussion 

286.54 287.83 A: right after september eleventh 

288.56 288.94 A: people 

289.45 292.98 A: said oh that's a safety hazard and the pilots couldn't get out but i'm sure 

293.43 294.49 A: that there could be a 

295.36 302.39 B: yeah there must be a way around that if we can build an airplane that can fly on autopilot across the country i'm sure we can build a door that has a fail safe 

297.52 298.08 A: i mean 

302.73 307.68 A: yeah or or just make an airplane that finds autopilot around the country you know 

306.63 308.49 B: oh yeah right exactly 

308.32 310.87 A: if it can't if it doesn't have pilots you know it's not going to have 

310.98 312.02 A: a chance to get hijacked 

311.96 313.50 B: yeah there's that 

313.23 316.07 A: there's obviously ways to go i just think that people uh 

316.70 321.42 A: people are willing to be searched a little more as long as it's random and doesn't always happen to them 

321.77 322.10 B: right 

321.82 324.33 A: but i don't think they can accept change as far as 

324.50 324.88 A: you know 

325.37 325.73 A: uh 

326.15 327.73 A: going (( )) 

327.86 329.10 A: technologically different 

329.20 330.31 A: (( )) you know something that 

330.69 334.15 A: not familiar and not comfortable to them i think that scares them more than 

334.76 337.01 A: a terrorist taking over there plane 

337.75 338.42 A: i think 

338.45 339.45 B: that's yeah 

339.06 339.75 A: most people 

339.75 340.41 B: pretty prescient 

340.32 340.61 A: still 

341.61 342.13 A: i think 

342.25 346.86 A: i that that that was sort of what i assumed would happen after after september eleventh i think 

347.33 347.95 A: people went 

348.07 348.46 A: to 

349.19 350.36 A: um sort of a heightened 

350.61 351.20 A: sense of 

351.86 352.23 A: you know 

352.42 352.90 A: fear 

353.02 355.99 A: (( )) a heightened sense of danger um after 

356.33 357.71 A: aft- after september eleventh but 

358.03 360.35 A: after a couple of months of not seeing much 

360.84 361.29 A: um 

361.50 362.72 A: people once again have 

362.82 365.02 A: the idea that it's never going to happen to them 

364.98 365.96 B: right exactly 

366.64 367.10 A: (( )) this 

366.92 369.04 B: become desensitized to it so quickly 

369.32 369.70 A: yeah 

369.74 371.35 B: but you know no matter how many time 

371.97 372.96 B: ashcroft or 

373.15 378.38 B: rumsfeld gets on the t._v. and says this is going to happen again it's just a question of when nobody really buy- you know it's it's hard to 

378.27 378.56 A: (( )) 

378.55 379.52 B: buy into that 

378.89 383.33 A: no nobody listens to them an- and i mean to a certain extent that's not that bad 

383.48 384.79 A: that's not a bad idea but 

385.20 386.73 A: uh nobody has 

386.82 387.54 A: um 

387.69 388.89 A: a sense of 

389.52 390.00 A: sense of 

392.82 393.63 A: of of 

394.28 395.25 A: of worry at least 

395.33 398.36 B: right no i think the sort of gloom and doom and the the sort of 

395.36 396.76 A: the concern i guess 

399.94 400.80 B: broad wide- 

400.91 401.74 B: spread um 

401.97 403.25 B: cultural tension 

402.37 402.87 A: yeah 

403.60 405.77 B: has definitely sort of just fallen by the wayside 

406.31 407.13 A: yeah like you said 

406.35 406.72 B: people have 

407.51 408.00 A: they (( )) 

408.59 409.61 A: american culture is 

409.73 411.64 A: it's full of people being desensitized 

411.74 412.35 A: to 

412.46 413.55 A: lots of things i mean 

413.56 414.25 B: exactly 

414.73 415.45 A: as soon as some- 

414.83 418.37 B: well and the fact that like we were instructed to go shopping as the healing process 

418.82 420.89 B: you know thi- i think things like that ju- 

420.99 428.74 B: ma- i mean not to say that that makes healing quicker for people who are immediately effected but for those of us who were lucky enough to to sort of be indirectly effected 

429.37 429.82 B: you know that's 

429.94 430.78 B: that's a pretty 

431.47 433.14 B: soothing type of bomb to 

433.89 435.83 B: to to put on a wound it's not 

436.25 441.67 B: it's perhaps not the best approach in the world i'm not arguing in favor of it but i do think that it 

441.89 442.23 B: you know 

442.59 443.13 B: because of 

443.83 446.25 B: because of the culture that we live in we're susceptible to 

446.84 447.13 B: sort of 

448.19 451.82 B: quick and comfortable and very self-centered fixes 

452.32 454.21 B: and that you know that's one of them 

454.39 466.11 B: so you know the fact that our leadership was saying this is the way that we need to sort of feel ourselves as a nation and as individuals was an easy mandate to pick up and it made it a lot easier to sort of forget the emotional loading of it pretty quickly 

466.50 466.79 A: yeah 

468.69 469.79 A: okay 

469.14 470.30 B: okay 

470.97 471.50 B: now what 

472.08 475.23 A: what what do we talk for another like five minutes (( )) 

474.54 477.91 B: i have no idea the do they cut us off at a certain point in time 

478.30 478.74 A: i don't know 

479.00 479.45 B: all right 

479.26 479.68 A: um 

481.53 483.15 B: if you're there recording our confusion 

481.99 482.31 A: any 

483.43 484.56 A: any other 

484.98 487.30 A: hey it's probably (( )) thing (( )) recording 

487.14 488.53 B: yeah i'm sure some poor grad student 

489.13 489.55 B: going to be 

489.72 493.77 B: during a content analysis on this or whatever hi grad student um 

494.10 496.18 A: sorry for this guy 

496.83 498.74 B: look that's what you get when you're a linguistic student 

497.06 497.94 A: um is there 

498.13 498.77 A: any other 

499.00 502.33 A: form of security that we could talk about as far as 

503.07 506.54 B: i don't know i know that amtrak's were requiring photo i._d. to get on the trains now 

507.48 508.10 A: (( )) 

508.62 510.91 A: i i don't think that well i don't know 

511.18 512.99 A: i i just never expected 

513.37 515.83 A: a a terrorist to take control of a train 

516.35 517.46 A: because i don't think 

518.99 522.51 A: i mean i i in in my personal opinion i think that terrorist- 

523.20 526.24 A: are intelligent about the way americans view 

526.23 526.50 B: that 

526.34 527.46 A: like their lifestyle 

527.34 531.70 B: exactly and trains are we are so not a public transportation focused society 

531.98 532.31 A: right 

532.44 533.14 A: uh i mean 

533.42 533.92 A: uh it's 

541.73 543.38 A: well duh of course i was (( )) 

541.86 542.31 B: (( )) 

542.41 545.34 B: right of course it was going to happen it's amtrak 

544.97 545.29 A: um 

545.90 546.89 A: eh you know i got 

547.06 548.78 A: (( )) if they could if they could you know 

549.05 552.57 A: blow up a a highway or something and we'd be more effected you know 

552.10 553.95 B: well that's you know it's interesting cause i 

554.25 559.53 B: drive back and forth sort of up and down the east coast a lot just betwee- like school and home and family and 

559.64 564.74 B: so i'm constantly on sort of heightened alert about bridges i think they could take out the new york city bridges 

565.07 573.86 B: and that would cause a bigger problem than taking out an amtrak train but every time you go over the g._w. you think you know they were they had checkpoints set up for a good long time but
