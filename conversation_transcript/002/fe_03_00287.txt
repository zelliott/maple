8.65 9.43 B: good

16.47 18.74 A: no new person yeah 

18.44 19.58 B: well that's good 

19.82 20.26 A: great 

19.92 20.35 B: um 

20.43 20.84 A: [breath] 

21.33 22.79 B: so do you fly much 

22.96 27.70 A: yeah fair amount actually yeah um 

25.81 26.38 B: mhm 

27.13 29.85 B: and do you think the um heightened security helps 

27.99 28.66 A: [laugh] 

29.87 30.85 A: [breath] 

31.48 35.47 A: i i suppose that i hope it does i ah i i don't know if 

35.93 37.11 A: sure it does but 

38.33 40.42 A: i 

40.76 42.21 A: people who manage to 

42.69 50.68 A: like they were tired of having their clippers taken away and they managed to find places to hide them and then if ordinary people can find places to hide things 

51.46 52.18 A: heaven knows what 

53.72 55.25 A: terrorists could do but ah 

54.65 55.43 B: oh yeah 

55.61 56.02 A: [breath] 

57.30 57.98 A: i don't know 

57.49 59.70 B: but i do i do think it discourages 

60.07 60.87 B: them i don't 

61.29 61.95 A: hopefully 

61.34 64.36 B: it may not stop anybody in progress 

64.47 64.77 B: but 

64.51 64.95 A: yeah 

65.48 66.94 B: i think that they um 

68.43 68.97 B: that they 

70.34 72.74 B: might have to find other ways to do what they 

73.77 74.29 A: yeah 

74.11 76.54 B: were thinking that they would be able to do and 

76.47 77.17 A: that could be 

77.72 79.42 B: i don't know i just know that 

80.34 81.33 B: after the first 

80.61 80.92 A: [noise] 

81.58 83.47 B: airport securities that were put in 

83.61 84.06 A: mm 

84.01 84.67 B: into place 

85.51 86.90 B: you know years and years ago at 

87.03 87.80 B: it seemed to 

88.49 90.46 B: make a difference hijackings were getting 

89.89 90.27 A: hm 

91.04 92.44 B: very commonplace 

91.88 93.33 A: oh no really 

93.11 94.21 B: oh yeah and then 

93.57 94.70 A: yikes 

94.42 94.83 B: so 

95.58 96.18 B: then they 

96.76 97.58 B: started um 

98.45 100.73 B: the widespread airport security and 

100.11 100.56 A: mm 

102.00 102.74 B: and it just 

102.98 104.59 B: it slowed down you know people 

104.14 104.81 A: oh okay 

104.87 105.77 B: found out it wasn't 

106.29 108.49 B: you know it wasn't going to be that easy so they 

106.30 106.71 A: [breath] 

107.82 108.44 A: right 

109.34 109.68 B: didn't 

109.82 112.18 B: it's just like you know not that many people have to get 

113.28 114.80 B: fined for running a red light 

115.35 116.65 B: for the red light 

115.40 115.87 A: sure 

116.82 117.37 B: to become 

117.84 120.90 B: effective when people know that they are going to be effective they 

120.97 121.55 A: sure 

122.08 123.19 B: they stop running them 

123.75 124.88 A: yeah (( )) 

124.67 124.98 B: so 

125.20 125.93 A: [breath] 

126.24 127.46 A: good angle on it yeah 

129.12 129.64 B: i think it 

129.74 130.58 B: discourages 

131.51 134.42 B: you know the terrorists are going to look for another way but ah 

134.52 135.31 A: sure 

135.21 136.48 B: maybe maybe the others 

136.65 138.01 B: other ways will be harder 

138.29 140.66 A: yeah that would be good yeah hopefully 

142.92 144.24 A: do you fly much 

144.89 146.23 B: ah well you know it's imp- 

146.34 148.45 B: two or three times a year probably not ah

160.90 161.62 B: i find he 

161.12 162.14 A: yeah 

161.75 162.15 B: some 

163.33 164.93 B: current event topics very 

165.36 166.13 B: difficult 

165.95 168.18 A: [breath] yeah they 

167.01 169.45 B: to to talk about they're not ah 

168.57 169.91 A: they are yeah

171.51 172.01 B: you know 

171.57 171.92 A: [breath] 

172.45 173.63 B: all consuming 

174.39 174.97 A: right

178.41 180.99 B: said my opinion on them i don't know what else to say 

180.86 186.43 A: right exactly say it again yeah just talking at random 

183.05 185.19 B: yeah i know i know because 

186.10 188.24 B: right right because we're supposed to talk for 

188.71 189.69 B: for ten minutes 

189.69 190.80 A: oh goodness yeah 

190.49 193.63 B: and it's really hard to talk for ten minutes (( after you feel like you said )) 

192.29 193.42 A: [breath] certainly 

194.49 196.02 B: everything you want to say 

196.02 197.43 A: right
