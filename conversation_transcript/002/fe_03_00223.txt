0.38 1.84 B: hello 

1.15 2.28 A: hi 

2.00 4.02 B: hi my name's brent 

3.42 5.25 A: oh hi my name's martin 

5.06 6.75 B: hi okay 

7.23 8.46 B: so 

7.40 10.38 A: so you start [laughter] 

9.47 10.93 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

10.97 15.46 B: uh what do i look for in a life partner huh 

15.61 19.38 B: well i think one important thing is probably a sense of humor 

19.10 20.35 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

19.67 22.21 B: that's important to me um 

22.38 25.48 B: because life has a way of um 

26.31 33.68 B: dealing its i mean you have your ups and downs but there are a lot of downs sometimes and i think you need a sen- sense of humor to 

33.81 36.14 B: get through some of those challenges 

36.15 42.27 A: well that's true i i think though that one of the most important things would be that you agree on 

42.39 51.77 A: fundamental basics i don't know if i can put the finger like that on on one thing but just saying that i don't know something sort of really important to you that 

51.08 55.58 B: kinda like world value maybe or something like that or views 

53.72 55.37 A: probably something like 

55.68 68.02 A: right i- in some things that definitely i mean of course anything can be argued but some things that you to have some common ground and i think the major rights and wrongs of things that you know allow you to 

67.96 74.15 A: uh build from there i think that it would be really difficult for me to be with someone that is completely the opposite from me 

73.98 80.80 B: right right right so you don't believe in uh in uh um the maxim that opposites attract and uh 

80.85 83.42 B: (( [laughter] )) 

80.97 93.49 A: i don't think so i think that applies to some degree but i don't know if there's something if there's some things that i hold really dearly and you're exactly against all that i think a har- pretty hard time 

93.51 98.55 A: um building from that especially if that's essential for me does that make any sense 

97.92 100.63 B: yeah uh-huh i think i understand what you're saying 

100.04 112.75 A: so i don't know i think it would be a little bit more difficult if you're so so different but i mean who knows different people value different things and some people appreciate some things more than others so you know i think it depends 

112.42 117.59 B: that's true um i think one one thing that's important too is the um 

118.10 124.38 B: how to say this in ab- ability to compromise perhaps is um a way of saying that um 

124.05 129.72 A: yeah i yeah i think that's [laughter] actually a really important [laughter] 

124.60 125.34 B: 'cause 

127.07 135.93 B: if [laughter] yeah 'cause you know we're you're never going to agree a hundred percent i know on everything and 

135.41 136.89 A: that's true 

136.39 140.08 B: yeah in fact i knew i had i i had a friend once who um 

140.63 155.48 B: he's it's funny i i- it seemed unnatural to me but he often with his spouse they would they would make decisions and he would say well you know my feeling on a scale from one to ten is seven 

155.29 156.26 A: uh-huh 

155.51 167.86 B: and she'd say well i feel like it's you know it's a four and then [laughter] and then they'd make a decision on whether or not to to proceed with that and to me it was really strange but it seemed to work with them 

162.71 163.79 A: [laughter] 

167.41 181.39 A: i don't know it's kinda cool though because you've got an empirical value there you know so you can like say well others if it's more than five we'll go for it [laughter] that's actually that's really interesting i never thought about it in those terms [laughter] 

170.66 172.92 B: [laughter] 

176.23 179.42 B: right exactly [laughter] 

180.54 192.21 B: yeah it just sounded it just when they went through it it just was so strange to me but but yeah i think i agree with you that i mean it worked but it just to me it just sounded unnatural to do that [laughter] 

190.97 194.54 A: [laughter] well you know but i think that's the key you know 

195.05 199.82 A: it could as long as it works for you you know who knows that's all i can say 

197.36 198.35 B: mhm 

199.51 200.56 B: right 

199.93 206.50 A: and so i don't know some people get some strange things going but if you're happy i mean hell you know who are we to say 

206.13 209.33 B: right exactly i know i know what you mean 

209.52 212.59 B: it's hard for us to be the judges isn't it [laughter] 

212.23 216.51 A: yeah it is although it's kind of easy sometimes to get into that mode but 

215.55 217.68 B: exactly [laughter] 

216.62 221.15 A: but i think we all have lots of opinion [cough] opinions when it comes to 

221.05 223.72 A: many things you know but i don't know it's 

223.26 224.21 B: right 

223.57 236.51 A: kind of wise to um put those on hold sometimes and and see and hear what other people think where they're coming from and sometimes you learn a lot more than you thought you would you know it's just you can contemplate things in a completely different way 

236.30 237.25 B: mhm 

236.54 242.08 A: and you know you entertain different possibilities i think that's that's actually really important 

241.47 245.89 B: yes i agree i i was thinking of another example um 

245.98 250.40 B: i had this question asked of me once and in a group and someone said 

250.48 256.63 B: that they thought that the most important quality from a life partner would be that he or she 

257.00 257.99 B: um 

258.14 263.01 B: squeezes the toothpaste tube from the from the end instead of the middle 

262.88 271.19 B: [laughter] and uh the funny thing was was that uh i had another friend who 

263.23 265.26 A: [laughter] 

271.04 282.29 B: who was trying to get out of a of a serious relationship and and he used that excuse he said well i you know i'm i'm not organized and i squeeze the tube in the middle 

275.42 276.46 A: uh-huh 

282.04 283.01 A: mhm 

282.39 287.87 B: and um the the his significant other said well 

288.49 297.75 B: that's okay you know we can we can still live together we can just buy the pump the pump [laughter] 

294.11 305.00 A: [laughter] well you see i don't know that's a great example of how you can work around a a difficult problem of just squeezing the toothpaste from the wrong 

304.88 311.10 A: from the wrong end i don't know that can be pretty significant for some people i guess [laughter] 

305.82 307.15 B: (( ri- right )) 

310.16 314.17 B: yeah i mean these two got married so [laughter] 

313.19 321.49 A: we- if they got married then the topped work i mean yeah there we go again who are we to say you know but i have a friend actually that she is 

316.17 317.38 B: [laughter] 

317.88 319.30 B: exactly 

321.68 322.73 A: um 

322.66 336.71 A: she talks a lot about like lit- for me are little things like that that are really important for her how organized people are but when it comes to um amalgamation poetry that's why i thought of it it's like they racing for the race in the bathroom she is really anal about that 

333.02 333.82 B: yeah 

335.33 337.46 B: uh-huh oh right right 

336.84 349.13 A: she is like i couldn't live with someone that comes and puts like this little bowl thing here when it was there that's why she says she's never gonna get married i mean she wants to have i guess a lover or something but she could never share 

347.22 348.54 B: [laughter] 

348.92 363.66 A: because her space has to be orated in such a way and i don't know i see i find that really odd but she's serious about it though she is like i can't do it you know if you come and move my things around i just i'm not happy any more so well okay [laughter] 

354.28 355.65 B: (( that yeah definitely )) 

362.86 370.82 B: she needs to meet some- maybe meet someone who is rich and can have they could have two bathrooms you know so they wouldn't have to [laughter] 

369.79 379.16 A: but act- actually you know i like that that that's a good way to put it it's like you can have your own bathroom and they can have their own bathroom so you don't have to worry about toiletries being misplaced 

374.60 375.85 B: [laughter] 

378.73 379.97 B: [laughter] 

379.25 386.26 A: you see there's always a solution that's the bottom line there's always a solution somewhere [laughter] the key is to find it 

381.05 383.18 B: su- sure 

384.06 385.35 B: i agree 

385.51 390.08 B: right i agree i agree someone once said that um 

390.16 396.93 B: the source of all um problems with with life partners is the um 

397.09 399.29 B: is selfishness and you know 

399.55 411.78 B: i i tend to agree that this was this was told to me by a therapist who had spent years working with with partners and and helping them work through problems and he said when he first hard that he thought 

403.73 404.62 A: mhm 

408.44 409.46 A: mhm 

412.04 424.22 B: no he thought that's not it there's you know there's more to it than all of that but but then after all that those years of experience he pretty much could reduce it to to to simply that that it was selfishness and i 

416.49 417.63 A: mhm 

424.16 429.08 B: i've always thought about that and wondered um if that if that is really 

429.22 430.62 B: what it is 

429.96 432.47 A: do you think that's that's what it is 

432.23 437.22 B: uh you know from my exp- it just seems that yeah it seems like people 

437.32 448.62 B: well i don't know think of the example of your of your friend with the toiletries you know is that is she being selfish i don't know i don't know if that if we would if you could say that i don't know 

446.89 458.80 A: you know i think so i think so i think that we're all selfish to some degree i think it's where you know where you draw the line and how far you can go but i think you're right i mean i suppose you could umbrella terms to say 

451.21 451.98 B: [laughter] 

458.57 459.68 B: yeah 

458.80 464.08 A: it's totally selfishness in the end because i think we are pretty particular right and 

462.90 464.64 B: yeah i think so 

464.06 472.68 A: you don't want some boundary stepped upon and i think that's when you have like the whole selfish come into play and say you know this is my limit from here on 

471.74 472.71 B: right 

472.56 479.20 A: this just can't happen and yeah i never thought of it in those terms though but i think that's that's very true 

476.94 477.96 B: yeah 

479.01 480.21 B: mhm 

479.53 482.63 A: it's kinda scary though at the same time to think that selfishness 

482.70 484.70 A: is the cause of that right 

483.88 488.55 B: is it the cause of all but yeah yeah [laughter] that may be true 

485.19 487.96 A: [laughter] it's the cause of all evil to 

488.34 496.10 A: some degree but i think it's right i think you're probably right i mean well your friend has a pretty interesting theory of what's going on there 

494.69 501.19 B: [laughter] yeah well i know well i'm i'm married actually and and um 

499.29 500.20 A: uh-huh 

501.40 503.75 B: i know that when i was 

503.77 516.54 B: single and i was old- i was older i was real- really old but um i felt like i was getting old and i was concerned that i wasn't going to find my life partner and and um 

504.66 505.53 A: uh-huh 

514.73 515.70 A: uh-huh 

516.82 524.96 B: what kinda scared me was is that that i could go i could do things it got to be that i could do things by myself 

524.50 525.88 A: mhm 

525.81 537.99 B: and be comfortable with it you know i could go to a movie 'cause when i was growing up i couldn't do that when i was in my younger ages i couldn't go to a movie by myself i had to go with my friends you know i felt uncomfortable being alone 

536.64 537.70 A: right 

537.85 541.21 B: but as i was going along i became more and more comfortable 

541.78 544.64 B: an- and kind of um 

544.72 548.47 B: how would i say um well comfortable doing 

548.72 554.35 B: doing things by myself a- and and it used to worry me because i thought wow if i 

549.90 550.62 A: (( mhm )) 

554.47 565.09 B: you know if i really begin to feel this way all the time then maybe i won't have a desire to to find yeah life partner so [laughter] 

561.85 563.38 A: to have a life partner 

563.77 567.93 A: [laughter] but what about now do you do things on your own or 

567.26 569.79 B: yeah no now well now 

569.82 580.69 B: yeah i do i do so much but you know my life is is i can i i feel like my life is so much fuller now that that i have a partner and i have some i have a few children 

576.71 577.76 A: right 

578.62 579.63 A: mhm 

580.70 589.37 B: and there are things that i could never experience have experienced or felt you know emotions and other things that never could come if i were to 

586.78 587.77 A: mhm 

589.43 592.17 B: not have um a life partner so 

591.63 606.39 A: but i see what you're describing though i think it's a pretty common feeling uh it's something that most of us don't talk about but i think that that's pretty common and i think i felt exactly the same way and now i'm not married but i'm in a long term relationship and i live with 

597.87 598.92 B: mhm 

606.22 619.65 A: this person and i think of it and now doing things on my own it just seemed a strange feeling you know my i became a we and we do things and we do that and we do like you know like this and we don't like that 

606.98 608.30 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

614.98 616.18 B: yeah right 

619.43 620.49 B: right 

619.57 623.44 A: and i just can't think of going back to that point where 

623.31 629.31 A: i just didn't have to share those things so everything was just my decision it just seems so odd 

629.19 635.40 A: but i think it's an asset like you were saying that you can do things on your own and and be independent to some degree 

629.28 630.26 B: right 

633.05 634.20 B: mhm 

635.23 636.47 A: because that 

636.37 641.27 A: i think that's always really important but for me i think it went the other way you know as time went by 

641.27 653.90 A: i think i became more and more dependent and now i think so wow what would my life be like if i were alone [laughter] it's so odd because i don't know what it would be like to be so different that i don't even really want to think about it [laughter] 

645.14 647.73 B: [laughter] yeah 

649.15 650.31 B: right 

652.42 655.66 B: right right i'm the same way yeah it 

654.62 656.49 A: it's just scary 

655.96 661.14 B: is scary to think you know and life is is quite fragile you know i mean we 

661.43 669.83 B: we like to think that we are uh invincible and you know that act- things aren't going to happen to us but 

665.21 666.31 A: mhm 

669.33 675.13 A: right those things happen always to other people but it's so true you know you never know what what's in store for you 

671.49 673.30 B: yeah yeah 

674.66 676.01 B: exactly 

675.41 684.93 A: the more ready you are to deal with those things is like like i say you know we all have a bag of tricks and the more tricks you have in that bag the better prepared you are to deal with life 

680.49 681.43 B: right 

684.19 685.34 B: mhm 

684.80 694.73 A: and sometimes it can be rather challenging you know one day you're living one way and the following morning life change completely and it just slapped you in the face and it's up to you now 

687.42 688.68 B: yeah right 

692.27 693.23 B: right 

694.49 695.47 B: yeah 

694.81 696.06 A: what are you gonna do 

695.83 700.67 B: yeah and i think at those points those kind of important junctures in your life you've you often 

700.97 710.26 B: reevaluate kind of what your priorities are as i mean what you think wow wow you know what what have i been spending my time doing 

704.64 705.24 A: (( mm )) 

709.96 711.14 A: mhm 

710.39 712.18 B: you know and 

712.63 719.90 B: you kinda think wow maybe i shouldn't have been doing that i should have been focusing on things that were more important but so unfortunately it takes those
