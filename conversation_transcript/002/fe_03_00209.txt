10.55 11.41 B: that's a funny question 

13.07 15.85 A: in a life partner 

14.19 15.10 B: that's right 

16.52 17.60 B: i'm not sure where to start 

20.67 21.11 B: um 

22.54 25.91 B: so i uh i actually asked this question of a teacher of mine in high school 

26.11 26.49 A: uh huh 

26.34 28.79 B: i guess the question was formulated a little differently 

29.42 29.81 B: um 

29.95 30.85 B: it was um 

31.23 32.98 B: what makes for a successful relationship 

33.73 34.13 A: uh huh 

34.66 35.55 B: and uh 

35.97 38.62 B: and he said that you need to have two out of three things in common 

39.70 40.62 B: determine what they are 

40.93 42.59 B: what the three things were 

42.93 44.49 B: so one of them was um 

46.84 47.90 B: uh goals 

48.14 49.27 B: one of them was 

49.93 52.70 B: uh values or morals or something like that 

53.65 54.22 B: and 

54.44 55.43 B: one was style 

56.44 57.71 B: so his idea was that 

58.17 59.78 B: if you've got two out of three then 

60.08 60.70 B: you're good enough 

61.34 63.33 A: that's interesting style 

63.04 63.68 B: yeah 

64.14 65.08 A: (( )) for that 

65.89 66.64 A: well are you married 

67.66 69.56 B: no not yet 

69.48 70.50 A: not yet 

70.67 71.99 A: no me either 

70.79 71.20 B: um 

72.60 73.98 B: i i live with my girlfriend 

74.22 75.01 A: oh o._k. 

75.67 79.84 A: i pretty much live with my boyfriend but not technically 

79.37 80.20 B: actually yeah 

80.00 83.29 A: but um are what you year are you at school 

83.54 84.07 B: um 

85.06 86.29 B: how'd you know i was in school 

86.60 89.59 A: oh i don't know i figured because it's a penn study 

89.85 90.66 B: oh 

89.94 93.06 A: sorry i didn't mean to press i was just 

91.36 91.87 B: oh 

93.33 94.77 B: oh i'm actually not a penn student 

94.64 95.11 A: oh o._k. 

95.51 95.98 B: um 

96.44 97.44 B: yeah i g- i'm 

97.78 99.74 B: in eighteenth grade nineteenth 

99.86 100.89 B: i'm a graduate student 

100.84 102.02 A: oh o._k. o._k. i see 

102.46 102.85 B: yeah 

102.67 104.88 A: y- anyway so what do you look for in a life partner 

105.74 106.20 B: um 

107.53 108.29 B: i guess i'll have to go back 

109.61 110.34 B: (( )) 

110.82 111.28 B: um 

115.02 116.82 B: i i actually think that style and 

116.95 118.13 B: and interests are a big 

118.62 119.89 B: uh component for me 

120.04 120.37 A: yeah 

121.99 123.13 A: thinking about it a lot lately 

123.38 124.05 A: but i think 

124.55 127.50 A: values is a big thing too i actually agree with your professor a lot 

128.79 129.13 B: yeah 

140.52 140.84 B: yeah 

141.87 142.55 B: yeah it's true 

143.42 144.19 B: although you know 

144.36 147.31 B: there's a weird thing about that because values kind of change over time 

147.44 147.89 B: i think 

147.65 147.96 A: uh huh 

148.61 149.16 B: so 

150.09 150.59 B: um 

151.72 152.21 B: there's this 

152.38 153.31 B: there's the sense in which 

153.76 155.25 B: even if your values are the sense 

155.41 156.25 B: when you start out 

156.40 156.74 A: uh huh 

156.94 160.45 B: they might not be y- um you know few years down the line 

160.74 161.10 A: right 

162.09 162.73 A: that's true 

162.20 162.47 B: just 

163.11 167.77 A: that's true i don't know i guess you actually have to be mature enough when you actually make the decision to get married 

168.15 168.57 B: yeah 

168.43 171.91 A: or to have a life partner i guess that uh you know 

172.05 174.13 A: that you know both of you are going to have pretty much 

174.32 176.04 A: be constant in what you want or i guess 

176.86 177.48 B: yeah it's true 

177.91 179.64 B: (( )) a friend of mine is getting married soon 

178.05 178.41 A: but 

180.22 181.14 A: oh yeah 

181.73 182.92 B: this is a really old friend 

183.47 184.86 B: and i i was talking to him about it 

185.15 185.69 B: a while ago 

186.31 187.03 B: and uh 

188.36 189.87 B: this is before he got engaged 

190.06 190.60 A: oh o._k. 

190.49 191.15 B: and he was 

191.26 191.72 B: sort of 

192.21 193.79 B: not ready to get engaged and i asked him 

194.63 195.19 B: why not 

195.44 197.42 B: and he said that it was because um 

198.25 199.33 B: he wasn't 

200.24 201.41 B: he wasn't sure that 

201.55 203.05 B: he and his girlfriend were 

203.49 206.19 B: um at sort of a stable point he felt like they were still 

206.61 208.75 B: you know growing and undergoing a lot of change 

208.75 209.52 A: right 

209.32 210.36 B: and he didn't want to make 

210.54 211.95 B: the sort of long term commitment 

212.41 213.42 B: when he thought that 

214.03 215.23 B: there was a potential that 

215.58 216.36 B: they could still 

216.58 218.79 B: change a lot and then not really be compatible 

218.90 219.76 A: yeah that makes sense 

222.06 225.94 A: i don't know i have a friend who's nineteen and she just got engaged 

225.77 226.26 B: oh really 

226.31 229.79 A: yeah i thought that was a little young but you know 

231.73 234.34 A: i don't know this is sort of weird topic i guess 

232.84 233.15 B: uh huh 

234.58 235.14 B: yeah 

234.77 237.91 A: especially if we're not at that stage in our life yet 

237.89 238.26 B: yeah 

239.73 240.03 A: yeah 

240.18 242.65 A: i know this is actually the first call i've done for the survey 

242.77 243.18 B: yeah 

243.47 244.99 A: my friend told me about it 

245.15 246.47 B: yeah i d- did one yesterday 

247.94 249.15 A: wh- what was the topic then 

249.69 250.22 B: um 

250.98 252.09 B: it was holidays 

252.19 255.19 A: oh oh o._k. i i think i would like that better but you know 

256.14 256.88 B: i think it just 

257.36 258.80 B: i don't know it makes just people 

259.01 260.06 B: just makes people nervous 

260.41 260.72 B: topic 

261.04 261.67 A: life partners 

262.17 262.63 B: yeah 

262.74 263.16 B: i think 

263.49 266.45 B: you know you're talking to someone you don't know about something sort of 

267.60 267.99 A: yeah 

269.03 269.36 B: i don't know 

269.15 272.35 A: i don't know i really don't know what to say because i'm definitely not at that point yet 

272.53 272.98 B: yeah 

273.57 275.74 B: well so do you distinguish between um 

276.38 279.26 B: boyfriends you might have for a brief period of time versus 

279.45 281.00 B: ones that would be more long term 

281.50 282.38 A: well 

282.01 282.79 B: because i suppose that 

283.02 283.95 B: these things would be similar 

284.18 287.40 A: i i g- i don't know the guy i'm with now i'm for a while so i guess 

288.60 293.80 A: i don't know i guess it's just if it sort of ends up working out it works out i don't think you can plan those things you know 

293.61 294.02 B: yeah 

295.23 297.08 B: yeah some people have this kind of 

297.42 301.10 B: oh he's the kind of guy i'd want to date but i wouldn't want to marry him 

301.38 301.75 A: uh huh 

301.96 302.35 B: (( )) 

302.60 304.20 B: and then for some people it's like 

304.98 306.88 B: you just sort of date and if it works out it works out 

307.19 308.91 B: yeah i'm i'm more like that like every 

309.21 310.55 B: every person i've dated was 

310.72 311.60 B: sort of a potential 

311.82 312.17 A: yeah 

315.26 316.43 A: isn't there right 

316.78 321.58 A: well my friend actually she was with her boyfriend for a while and he broke up with her but 

329.16 334.14 A: three years and so she refused to believe that they could possibly grow apart in that time 

333.68 334.12 B: hehe 

334.78 335.45 A: pretty funny 

335.56 335.97 A: but 

336.25 338.15 A: i mean not funny it was sad for her but anyway 

338.93 344.11 A: i thought that was kind of interesting because i don't know i don't know how you can have that sort of i mean not attachment but just 

344.94 346.52 A: the idea that you're going to marry someone 

346.67 348.00 A: so much so that 

348.75 350.41 A: even when something like that happens you know 

350.78 351.22 B: yeah 

352.78 353.95 A: d- do you believe in soul mates 

354.86 355.30 B: um 

355.56 356.32 B: i guess so 

356.96 358.73 B: i think the the plural is important there 

358.83 359.71 B: i mean i think that 

361.45 363.82 B: i don't think it it's sort of like there's one person 

363.91 368.59 A: oh o._k. good i definitely don't believe that 

364.62 364.98 B: um 

368.22 370.71 B: but i think you but at the same time i do think you can 

370.90 371.96 B: sort of have that kind of 

372.59 373.65 B: connection with somebody that 

374.73 376.17 B: they're sort of the right person for you 

376.29 376.66 A: yeah 

376.87 379.06 A: they may think that you make the choice 

379.36 384.65 A: i don't know i i do think it's you know you make the choice to be with somebody and obviously you may walk out or you may not 

386.61 390.00 A: compromising and work it out and then you can otherwise you don't you know 

390.34 391.00 B: yeah yeah 

391.51 393.90 A: you know maybe i'm pessimistic 

394.81 398.25 B: i i i don't know i'm not sure that i think o- i think of it as an optimistic 

398.32 398.95 A: oh o._k. 

398.54 398.99 B: view 

399.24 400.27 B: th- sort of 

400.42 404.81 A: yeah i'm d- definitely not a determinist because i don't know 

405.54 407.51 B: yeah i mean it's not like uh 

408.28 411.06 B: i guess the pessimistic view would like there's just that one person 

411.84 412.57 B: and uh 

412.74 414.41 B: you know if you screw it up that's it 

414.42 415.72 A: that's true i guess 

415.36 417.27 B: that w- there goes your one person 

417.92 419.23 A: i don't know 

419.79 427.54 A: i i still have friends who are you know from watching disney when they were little still thing think there's prince charming out there or whatever which i think is funny 

427.84 428.21 B: yeah 

428.90 429.99 A: but 

431.10 432.93 A: you're like well that's me 

433.74 434.12 B: that's right 

434.21 435.56 A: i'm sure your girlfriend thinks that 

435.81 437.48 B: yeah 

438.37 439.44 B: it's possible 

439.81 442.37 A: so do they cut us off after a certain amount of time or do we have 

442.15 443.13 B: yeah they do 

442.50 446.21 A: o._k. i was going to say do we have figure out when it's been ten minutes 

443.25 444.08 B: it says that 

446.05 446.57 B: yeah 

446.70 447.12 B: i'm not 

447.80 450.54 B: they just sort of comes on and says o._k. now it's time to say goodbye 

451.12 451.64 A: oh o._k. 

452.45 455.13 B: i wonder they're u- i'm not sure not even sure what it's being used for 

455.29 461.84 A: well i i mean hopefully it's really being used for the linguistics things they say it is because i don't know if it is 

461.51 464.24 B: so i actually use the linguistic data base 

464.55 464.84 B: um 

465.36 467.31 B: that's that's how they got my email address 

466.93 471.35 A: oh you do o._k. so it (( is being used )) for linguistics good because i was little bit worried but i figured it was 

469.48 469.77 B: uh 

471.03 472.53 B: well but i use it for something different 

472.64 473.53 B: something that 

473.90 474.95 B: not sure why they would 

475.12 475.63 B: need to read 

476.03 476.49 B: uh 

477.17 477.54 B: so 

478.05 478.76 B: i d- i 

479.35 479.79 B: some of the 

480.04 481.21 B: kind of research that i do 

481.48 482.80 B: involves needing to know 

483.23 483.67 B: um 

483.90 486.12 B: what words are more frequent and less frequent 

486.38 487.68 A: oh 

486.56 487.41 B: language research 

488.02 488.59 B: and 

489.00 489.91 B: they used to have 

490.11 492.13 B: um this really nice online 

492.83 496.42 B: database where you could find that out you know you just type in the words you want to know and it tells you 

496.99 497.55 B: you know 

498.08 499.56 B: how often that word occurs 

499.70 501.39 B: in the wall street journal or something 

501.43 502.48 A: oh that's cool 

502.28 502.73 B: am 

502.85 504.06 B: relative to other words 

504.16 504.50 B: or something 

504.60 505.04 B: so 

505.40 507.27 B: so if you want to do an experiment you can 

507.57 507.98 B: present 

508.46 511.34 B: high frequency words and low frequency words and see what the differences are 

512.35 513.33 B: blah blah that kind of stuff 

513.44 514.28 A: that's interesting 

514.29 514.63 B: um 

514.88 518.18 A: yeah i don't it was interesting that they asked about regional stuff because 

518.85 519.14 B: yeah 

519.21 523.43 A: i assumed that was it has something i'm from california so it's really different than here 

523.54 524.27 B: yeah 

524.47 524.84 A: so 

525.16 527.10 B: maybe it has to do with uh your speech patterns
