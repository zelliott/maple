13.46 14.38 A: nope 

13.96 14.91 B: no me either okay 

15.87 18.19 B: uh what has changed for you since september eleventh 

19.23 25.03 A: um unfortunately probably not a whole lot since i'm a graduate student so i just keep going back and forth to school 

25.19 25.61 B: yeah 

25.66 29.73 A: um i know there was a big thing in our community because just a couple doors down there's a 

30.79 33.00 A: there's a mosque and so there were some 

33.18 38.06 A: positive demonstrations of people that were very concerned about the arab people in our community 

38.25 39.29 B: well that that's good 

39.27 40.77 A: yeah 

51.08 51.62 B: someone i know was 

51.77 53.03 B: was traveling that day 

53.22 54.03 B: like in the air 

54.10 54.52 A: mhm 

54.33 56.06 B: so that was that was a big fiasco 

56.17 57.57 A: oh well that's scary 

57.38 62.37 B: yeah it was a little scary uh they were coming back from singapore though so they weren't really anywhere 

63.34 64.67 B: luckily anywhere near 

65.03 66.04 B: the united states yet 

66.17 66.80 A: right 

66.18 68.35 B: um and they were coming in on the other side of the country 

69.64 70.17 B: um 

70.45 71.51 B: but it was just eh 

71.84 73.76 B: you know drama basically 

73.39 74.40 A: right right 

74.08 76.54 B: i think it took them three extra days to get home 

76.91 82.80 A: i know it's changed for my husband because he does travel a lot so he's had to do things you know like take off his shoes or 

79.35 79.79 B: yeah 

82.54 83.01 B: right 

83.75 84.49 A: um 

83.77 87.34 B: i think that's the only thing that will really because i like to travel and once i start 

87.70 88.25 B: um 

88.45 91.32 B: traveling again i'm sure it'll i'll i'll notice the impact 

91.76 92.23 A: right 

92.36 94.01 B: um on that industry a- at least 

94.10 94.51 A: right 

94.75 98.14 A: he's really kind of um intrigued though because it seems that 

98.37 100.94 A: you know there's a profile that they stop people to look 

101.95 103.85 A: uh to kind of do the extra search 

103.90 104.41 B: really 

104.28 108.56 A: and once he's stopped one day if he has two flights that day he'll be stopped again 

108.85 111.64 A: so it's like a he wondered if there's like a daily profile 

111.43 112.01 B: wow 

112.24 113.12 A: yeah 

112.51 113.61 B: maybe yeah 

113.72 115.11 B: well that would make sense though 

115.33 117.19 A: yeah i guess uh 

116.12 119.73 B: i mean i would i would hope that they would even it out a little bit you know 

119.41 121.24 A: well i guess he's kind of concerned because 

121.63 122.81 A: if he 

122.90 125.38 A: were did have a mal intent 

125.86 132.16 A: um would he then you know if you're not picked the first flight does that mean they're not going to pick you the second flight so you can you know do whatever you want 

132.36 133.11 B: that's true 

133.19 135.87 A: so he's a little concerned about that but 

136.19 138.12 B: yeah i'm very curious to uh 

138.54 140.06 B: to see how traveling is now 

140.85 141.94 B: um as far as 

142.07 145.52 B: i know a lot of people think i'm crazy because i still want to fly but 

146.29 148.52 B: i don't really think it's much different as far 

148.04 153.14 A: well you know if if you stop everything then the terrorists have won on many many fronts 

152.75 153.74 B: right they've they've 

153.91 155.61 B: they've hit you on more levels than 

156.61 158.04 B: than just the physical level 

158.74 159.32 B: um 

159.46 160.72 B: which obviously they have 

160.88 162.09 B: but i mean i'm sure 

162.21 163.86 B: deep down we're all impacted 

164.04 164.64 A: oh we are 

164.21 165.75 B: in ways that we're not noticing yet 

164.79 165.23 A: we are 

165.91 166.21 B: but 

165.95 166.35 A: right 

166.50 166.77 A: but 

167.13 169.04 A: well it really brings out a lot about 

169.31 171.28 A: how our political system thinks that we should 

171.96 172.58 A: fight back 

172.85 173.39 B: yeah 

173.48 173.90 B: and that 

174.12 177.59 B: there's a whole i don't know if we're supposed to go into that but 

178.66 183.37 A: well it r- i think it makes me the whole incident has made me more aware of 

183.49 184.03 A: um 

184.51 186.75 A: how our politicians work and how 

187.78 195.98 A: i might want to be a little more active and make my view known because i don't think we should be out there you know beating everybody up just because we're the most powerful coun- 

191.26 191.74 B: yeah 

196.18 196.74 B: right 

197.31 197.75 B: oh 

198.43 200.69 B: and we've we've kind of had that um 

200.84 202.67 B: that attitude for a long time and i think it 

204.12 209.46 B: uh one good thing that came from this is that a lot more americans are aware of what it is that we do 

209.56 210.72 B: to other countries now 

210.13 211.83 A: right right 

211.56 214.75 B: um c- because people were blind to it and they didn't understand 

215.00 219.37 B: i mean up until the fa- uh i i mean a year later there are still people that don't understand that 

219.64 221.74 B: these attacks weren't completely unprovoked 

221.99 222.56 A: right 

222.54 226.26 B: i mean there there's a lot of hatred towards our country and 

226.38 229.63 B: not all for bad reasons and not all for nothing you know 

229.79 232.80 A: i know but a lot of people would not agree with you 

232.30 233.62 B: well no i know 

233.27 238.13 A: you know but i th- that that's very true you know and if you just keep marginalizing people they're just going to keep 

238.68 241.82 A: trying to figure out how to get back at you in a big since 

240.83 243.19 B: exactly and it's just you know 

242.57 244.94 A: you're not letting them be like normal 

244.36 247.72 B: unfortunately right unfortunately they the the country that we 

248.44 252.41 B: we peed off had had one psycho running around i don't know 

252.37 253.29 A: right 

252.95 253.34 B: uh 

253.76 255.58 A: well yeah that's 

254.72 256.35 B: or many psychos 

256.19 258.47 A: well you know it only take o- takes one 

258.14 259.03 B: it really does 

258.57 259.06 A: um 

259.74 264.85 A: so if we keep marginalizing people then the the psycho people within their contingents you know 

265.31 265.74 B: well 

265.52 269.33 A: can develop and get a lot of following because there are people that are marginalized 

267.37 270.25 B: and they'll exactly and they'll start to sound like they're making sense 

271.06 272.00 A: right right 

272.15 273.22 A: um 

272.15 273.89 B: and it goes back to you know 

274.01 276.30 B: the holocaust i mean it's the same kind of thing 

275.03 277.31 A: right i was just going to say 

277.02 277.52 B: you know it 

277.42 280.14 A: you look at hitler people didn't agree with him either but 

279.52 280.12 B: right 

280.23 282.47 B: but look at all the followers he had and that's 

282.59 284.43 B: that's how bin laden gets it you know 

284.47 286.03 A: right 

284.98 285.35 B: he's 

285.80 287.18 B: crazy but he's brilliant 

287.41 288.22 B: and uh 

288.80 290.85 B: otherwise he still wouldn't be alive 

290.72 293.19 A: right which we're never quite sure but 

292.77 294.27 B: i know i know 

294.48 297.08 A: that that's its own little thing 

296.12 297.76 B: uh and they just had those i was 

298.05 299.69 B: uh on the internet and they 

302.70 304.90 B: the tapes that proved that he was still alive 

305.93 307.57 B: but it's so hard to even 

307.76 309.56 B: know what to believe in the media 

309.42 315.17 A: well right i mean now it's like we're all searching for him as though he's the only one who's going to mastermind a vicious plot 

312.40 312.77 B: as 

314.73 316.22 B: exactly exactly 

315.47 319.20 A: there are probably other people you know let's let's look at our 

319.33 320.47 A: whole policy 

320.56 321.06 B: right 

321.17 322.16 B: and let's look at uh 

322.32 324.65 B: the people on our end and wh- you know 

325.49 326.34 B: who uh 

328.96 329.61 A: who do 

329.11 331.87 B: who are supposed to be counteracting this this type of uh 

331.17 331.49 A: right 

332.24 332.81 B: this type of 

333.15 333.69 B: act 

334.04 335.13 A: right 

335.03 335.37 B: but 

336.04 340.01 B: as far as changes i i think that's the most thing i see is uh 

341.23 342.49 B: i think it brought out a lot of 

342.62 342.98 B: people's 

349.73 351.12 B: how open minded they really are 

352.52 355.03 B: um actually at university of penn 

355.70 357.78 B: there are a lot of arab um 

359.93 360.79 B: arab descended 

361.30 363.66 B: workers and a a few of uh 

362.11 362.50 A: mhm 

363.76 365.19 B: i i'm in that area 

365.95 366.72 B: and uh 

367.09 367.93 B: just some of the 

369.47 370.68 B: the attitude that they get 

371.19 375.54 B: even now i mean i'm obviously it's it's a deep seated thing and people are still going to 

375.78 376.27 B: feel 

375.91 376.78 A: right 

376.90 381.52 A: well up here i'm in upstate new york and there's a sikh temple further up north 

378.55 379.10 B: are you 

382.07 383.81 A: whose name was 

384.22 385.42 A: gobind 

386.01 386.93 A: sadan 

387.86 389.94 A: and there were three teenagers who 

390.05 390.71 A: thought 

391.15 391.84 A: the name 

392.13 394.62 A: of the temple was go bin laden 

394.85 395.33 B: oh 

395.46 396.55 A: and so they torched it 

396.62 397.31 B: ah 

396.70 398.29 A: one day after drinking 

398.38 399.76 B: oh my gosh 

413.89 414.42 B: yeah 

415.74 417.68 B: and what does that reflect i mean 

418.17 422.82 A: it reflects oh well let's jump to a conclus- uh an assumption you know 

422.11 423.48 B: and let's just attack it 

422.99 423.30 A: and 

423.45 425.85 A: and act on it right right rather than 

423.59 423.96 B: and 

425.05 427.18 B: wh- what are we trying to you know 

426.95 431.08 A: yeah let's go ask somebody else is this really what these people are for sh- 

428.49 429.04 B: yeah 

431.03 431.53 B: right 

431.26 435.08 A: somebody should know not like we'll be the vigilantes and go take care of it 

434.56 434.95 B: right 

435.10 439.94 B: but it's the same kind of act that we're angry about i mean on a smaller scale obviously but 

439.25 442.81 A: right 

440.11 441.74 B: it's just that well obviously 

442.27 444.75 B: nine eleven took a lot more planning than than burning 

444.85 446.32 B: down a building but 

446.14 447.39 A: right right 

446.94 450.29 B: but on a bigger scale honestly it's three teenage boys but 

447.62 448.30 A: but you're right 

448.50 449.38 A: you're right we're going to 

450.67 454.69 B: imagine if those three teenage boys got one wrong idea and ended up 

455.27 457.18 B: with a huge following you know 

457.38 457.72 B: it's 

457.42 458.91 A: right yeah ye- 

458.44 460.64 B: that was just like fighting fire with fire well 

460.11 462.11 A: that's right i was just going to say that 

461.38 461.69 B: yeah 

462.49 463.75 B: no pun intended 

463.49 464.95 A: right oh yeah really wow 

465.40 465.74 B: but 

466.11 468.16 B: that's the other thing i think has changed people like 

468.37 469.63 B: really watch their 

470.05 471.11 B: their humor now 

471.72 472.14 A: mhm 

471.98 474.36 B: uh i think it's changed a little bit i know 

475.37 477.37 B: my friends and i are all very 

477.51 480.45 B: jokey about everything there's nothing is sacred with us you know 

480.89 481.69 B: but even 

482.37 482.96 B: with us 

483.35 485.97 B: we were we were a little tight lipped about things at first 

486.19 486.83 A: mhm 

486.80 487.40 B: um 

488.33 488.89 B: and 

489.29 494.89 B: and i i mean i see even in in on television and in movies people are starting to li- lighten up about it but 

495.66 497.81 B: for a long time it was kind of like that was th- 

498.03 499.55 B: the taboo subject you can't 

500.13 500.51 B: can't 

500.64 502.04 B: possibly make a joke you know 

502.92 505.68 B: um which is understandable out of respect for the people 

506.53 507.04 B: who were 

507.59 508.94 B: personally impacted 

509.89 511.72 B: um which i can't even imagine 

512.14 513.75 A: oh i know no 

512.25 513.10 B: luckily i 

513.52 515.42 B: anyone i knew who was in the area 

515.65 516.10 B: um 

516.55 517.67 B: my one friend who worked 

517.92 518.98 B: in the world trade center 

520.21 523.36 B: called out wor- called out that day because he was lazy 

524.83 525.97 B: see laziness pays 

528.66 530.04 A: yep 

530.16 531.24 A: so well but that that's 

531.42 534.61 A: kind of scary all the people that kind of were running it late for whatever reason 

534.59 535.09 B: yeah 

536.49 539.00 B: it's amazing how many little things can change 

548.91 549.34 B: yeah 

551.07 552.24 B: i think all over though that's 

552.36 554.62 B: that's the most noticeable thing is that people 

555.19 556.20 B: people are more aware 

558.18 560.42 B: going on around the world as opposed to just around 

560.67 561.36 B: their own 

562.27 562.59 B: house 

562.75 564.57 B: you know or their own area
