57.07 60.15 B: and eh i've been married for twelve years 

60.46 61.04 B: um 

62.40 63.10 B: i know what 

63.84 64.61 B: basically 

65.46 67.00 B: uh i think would be 

67.47 69.33 B: good qualities for a life partner 

71.12 72.29 B: but in a 

72.64 74.64 B: but of course i'm just speaking for a male 

74.82 75.42 B: do they want 

76.94 78.51 A: oh i i i don't know (( )) 

78.03 79.19 B: for male and female 

79.29 82.67 A: i think they want us to talk mostly um 

84.03 86.68 A: well that's a very interesting question though is it is it 

87.01 88.53 A: is it really different from 

89.93 90.77 A: that is to say 

92.07 93.35 A: you know man looking for 

94.78 99.61 A: certain qualities of a woman and a woman looking for certain qualities in a man are the the same 

100.15 101.60 A: qualities going to be the ones that 

101.72 103.82 A: that end up make making for 

104.24 105.77 A: successful partnership 

106.97 109.70 B: well i guess it's traditional qualities versus 

111.21 113.44 B: uh what people may look for now 

114.29 115.44 A: oh well that's a that 

115.60 119.92 A: that's an interesting can of worms what do you see as being the traditional qualities 

120.57 124.29 B: well traditional for a male might be ability to earn money 

124.89 126.39 B: or strength 

126.60 127.39 B: or 

128.04 128.76 B: um 

132.36 133.25 A: all those sort of 

133.47 134.22 B: yeah the 

133.93 136.96 A: socially and biologically conditioned things 

136.73 137.39 B: yeah 

137.78 138.48 B: uh 

139.84 142.97 B: whereas now women tend to look for men who 

143.14 144.48 B: may be more caring 

145.24 149.84 B: uh not so much financial because they're able to earn money themselves 

148.84 149.62 A: i see 

150.69 151.26 A: yeah 

151.64 152.04 A: yeah 

152.19 153.01 B: where there have been 

152.89 154.03 A: that's an interesting 

154.12 155.61 B: well there's been changes in that 

154.58 154.86 A: sure 

155.71 156.54 A: there certainly have 

158.11 159.04 A: um 

160.17 165.21 A: that's intere- cause i i mean i was going to the the first thing that came came into into my head 

165.76 166.86 A: uh 

167.57 167.83 A: was 

167.95 168.25 A: that 

168.40 168.69 A: what 

168.95 169.25 A: what 

169.38 170.36 A: ultimately 

171.20 172.90 A: seems to matter is 

174.56 176.54 A: some sort of shared values 

177.49 179.48 A: you know that you that you're not looking past 

180.55 182.43 A: past one another for uh 

182.74 183.95 B: yeah similarities 

184.08 185.06 A: yeah 

184.80 186.76 B: similarity in background maybe 

187.54 189.88 B: to make it a little bit easier to understand 

191.05 194.32 A: yeah i suppose so uh 

194.40 194.76 B: excuse me 

195.39 201.11 A: i mean i wou- wouldn't wouldn't want to rule out the possibility of of getting along well with someone from 

201.78 203.36 A: from a different background but 

204.64 205.17 B: well 

204.98 205.34 A: some 

205.72 207.34 A: some sort of commonality 

208.48 208.92 A: i mean 

211.54 214.70 A: you know some sort of commonality along with the differences you know 

214.95 215.43 B: yes 

216.45 218.12 B: well that makes perfect sense 

218.74 220.26 B: and in fact that's 

220.86 223.21 B: i think why traditionally 

224.14 225.95 B: people always married within their 

226.29 229.46 B: neighborhood or social group or whatever 

229.14 229.75 A: mmm 

229.81 231.63 B: and they don't do that so much anymore now 

231.85 233.34 A: well yeah i mean 

233.45 234.01 A: lots of 

234.14 237.07 A: lots of things enter into that i guess more mobility 

238.08 239.01 A: just physical 

240.43 242.91 A: mobility right i mean people don't 

241.32 241.90 B: oh sure 

243.56 249.52 A: people used to (( )) go go back far enough and you don't have to go back very far people used to sort of 

250.26 253.16 A: generally speaking be born and and died within 

253.61 254.91 A: thirty miles of the same 

255.06 255.40 A: spot 

255.53 256.49 A: (( )) 

255.69 256.16 B: sure 

256.60 259.96 A: kind of thing that doesn't happen (( )) i know i've 

260.12 261.02 A: i would never have 

261.20 261.47 A: met 

261.63 266.38 A: my wife if i hadn't been transported across the continent from where i was born and and 

267.12 268.10 A: and that sort of thing 

268.90 271.05 B: were you in college together 

271.53 271.91 B: or 

274.52 275.22 B: oh okay 

278.01 281.25 A: i mean i was still living in the town where i had gone to school so 

282.67 284.78 A: so that was a fact- that was certainly a factor in 

284.90 286.81 B: what qualities did you admire in her 

287.02 290.12 A: oh the sixty four dollar question 

294.20 296.04 A: i don't know i mean 

300.73 304.09 A: partly it was the we we we had com- common common interests 

304.85 305.94 A: we're both musicians 

306.27 306.81 B: mhm 

306.79 308.14 A: um 

308.69 311.34 A: uh partly it was the i mean she seems a very 

311.48 313.54 A: very very decent sort of type 

326.50 331.24 B: yeah i kind of know all about that too i have one of those myself 

327.53 328.20 A: (( )) 

329.77 331.57 A: yeah yeah 

331.93 332.78 A: (( )) 

334.24 335.08 A: so uh 

335.27 336.01 A: yeah that 

335.75 338.39 B: and it's funny the things also that you look for in 

338.50 340.27 B: the beginning of a relationship 

341.09 344.49 B: sometimes you almost uh realize by accident 

345.06 346.64 B: the longer you're in a relationship 

347.45 349.82 B: those qualities that you may have overlooked 

350.10 351.34 A: yeah 

355.68 357.22 A: i think we may have had some of these (( )) 

357.51 360.39 A: same experiences you know as as you as you go down the road you 

361.38 361.92 A: you uh 

362.08 364.67 A: you realize what is the road that your you've been going down 

364.80 365.40 A: sort of thing 

365.63 366.07 B: mhm 

377.73 380.68 B: you didn't tell me any qualities besides those two 

380.78 382.96 A: oh let's see which which ones were those 

383.75 385.28 B: how about traditional qualities 

385.36 387.75 A: traditional qualities uh 

388.39 396.50 A: you mean the things that sort of appeals to the the hunter gatherer gatherers slash uh corpora- uh uh gray flannel suit uh type uh 

397.06 398.02 A: type guy 

399.25 401.94 A: well let's see um 

403.50 413.89 A: oh gosh but i'm not that kind of guy you know but but no she was not not bad looking i mean as far as that goes there was a physical attraction 

406.06 407.07 B: but you know i 

410.92 415.08 B: i would bet that somewhere in those recesses are those 

414.74 418.48 A: oh yeah i mean my reptile my reptilian brain is still in good 

418.70 420.68 A: good shape you know 

418.77 421.10 B: yeah 

420.96 424.34 A: (( )) the early primate is is in their working too 

426.89 427.25 A: but 

427.64 434.65 A: i don't know as i as as i see think about it i i i'm i'm thinking about this question shared values shared backgrounds differen- 

434.75 435.18 A: different 

435.37 438.39 A: background and i i i think eh i think maybe part of 

439.11 440.90 A: part of it was was that 

441.40 444.89 A: her background was just enough different from mine that it it sort of 

445.04 446.05 A: filled in 

446.46 454.19 A: things that i i missed out on in in in my life i mean she came from a very large family i came from a very small family 

454.33 454.80 B: mhm 

455.25 456.16 A: for example 

462.30 463.56 B: well i had looked for a 

463.09 464.46 A: what yeah you was going to say what 

464.62 465.71 A: what what qualities 

466.82 468.87 A: what qualities gr- grabbed you 

468.71 469.60 B: well 

469.77 474.37 B: to be very honest well of course my husband is is i i always thought he was very good looking 

474.91 475.55 B: um 

475.95 478.41 B: he'd been married before and had a child so 

479.00 481.70 B: i knew what his parenting abilities were 

482.13 483.28 B: appreciated that 

482.22 482.75 A: oh 

483.99 484.84 B: and uh 

484.98 490.57 B: believe it or not the thing that i liked most about him was that he could fix things around the house 

490.67 491.55 A: oh 

492.66 494.59 A: that's a very attractive quality 

494.03 496.31 B: very attractive 

495.83 500.05 A: i have to confess my spouse possesses it in in abundance whereas i'm not 
500.29 501.96 A: permitted to play with sharp objects 

505.36 509.30 A: because basically anything that doesn't have an undo key 

509.59 510.87 A: i'm hopeless at 

510.67 513.52 B: then your wife has that 

513.97 521.66 B: ability to control a situation and and that's a very good quality 

518.85 521.91 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

521.81 525.10 B: she knows when to say no 

526.80 533.37 A: no she's very good at that sort of thing actually very very very level headed i i think i think that that was the quality that 

533.50 537.69 A: (( )) i somehow consciously or otherwise knew i needed 

538.01 539.00 A: um (( )) 

538.51 540.12 B: yeah you look for something that 

539.17 539.57 A: yes 

540.43 541.97 B: may be a piece that you're missing 

543.30 545.24 A: compli- complimentary qualities that 

545.48 545.82 B: yeah 

546.05 546.80 A: that sort of thing 

548.73 551.47 B: i wasn't sure how long we're supposed to talk 

551.37 556.97 A: i'm shuffling through the document here trying to trying to look but but i think they will beep us when when (( )) 

556.29 557.02 B: oh okay 

557.50 558.75 A: when the time comes 

558.32 559.65 B: i didn't read my papers 

560.07 561.10 B: that's one thing i 

560.79 563.24 A: i haven't read them for a while
