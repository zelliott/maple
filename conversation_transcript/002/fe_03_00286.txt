1.49 2.83 B: hi this 

1.73 2.68 A: (( hi )) 

3.05 3.95 A: hello 

3.57 4.51 B: (( hello )) 

4.53 5.38 A: hello 

5.36 7.21 B: uh this is denise best 

7.23 8.06 A: hello 

7.81 8.78 B: hi 

9.22 10.87 A: i'm kristen asplin 

13.08 16.80 B: so what do you think about the security of uh 

13.77 15.37 A: to talk about 

18.10 19.22 A: um 

19.85 26.25 A: i think that probably it will only help um with 

26.75 29.91 A: the less intelligent people like the shoe bomber guy 

29.60 30.48 B: right 

30.07 30.62 A: (( i )) 

30.92 34.80 A: don't really think it will do much for other things 

35.77 42.22 B: well i think it's almost like a security blanket you know it doesn't really accomplish 

39.94 41.85 A: yeah 

42.68 46.84 B: i think it's creating more problems really to tell you the truth though the 

47.06 50.32 B: sense of a false sense of security 

50.50 51.46 B: because it 

50.57 52.03 A: very visible 

51.71 53.51 B: right it's visible 

53.57 55.75 B: um it's expensive 

55.73 57.29 A: mhm 

56.08 60.71 B: and it's time not only financially expensive but time consuming 

60.76 64.56 B: personally i have not been to an airport since nine eleven 

64.75 65.64 A: (( oh )) 

65.00 71.20 B: i haven't been on an airplane but i work with professors that are i do the travel for them 

71.00 72.44 A: mhm 

71.22 79.47 B: and they are constantly flying international domestic flights and there's a a marketable difference 

76.55 77.66 A: yeah 

79.48 81.74 B: (( in just the the )) 

81.90 84.02 B: time frame that they to the 

84.17 87.27 B: amount of time that they have to devote to traveling 

87.12 88.74 A: mhm 

87.83 90.91 B: and the amount of 

92.04 98.86 B: like i said the false securities of i've had several professors that were evacuated off planes 

96.45 97.41 A: (( [noise] )) 

98.62 100.94 A: mhm 

99.98 102.13 B: because of the security not 

102.20 103.93 B: not being up to par 

103.91 104.68 A: (( oh )) 

104.83 105.81 B: (( so wow )) 

105.39 106.46 A: i've had 

106.58 113.93 A: i've actually flown a lot myself i flew on the twenty ninth of september um to a wedding 

114.12 116.42 B: (( brave you [laughter] )) 

115.03 117.83 A: [laughter] and uh 

119.08 120.11 A: i think 

120.26 123.82 A: the amount of extra time it's taking has gone down considerably 

124.87 126.47 A: the only time 

127.27 129.59 A: it was a real inconvenience 

129.88 131.54 A: was one time 

131.70 141.57 A: the plane had a maintenance and i had to switch plane carriers but with the bag matching system that means i had to go and pick up my bag and go back to the ticket counter 

133.24 134.19 B: mhm 

142.01 144.65 A: to go and re check in my bag 

145.19 147.93 A: so i went through the whole airport thing twice 

147.82 151.26 B: wow mm that really is disappointing 

151.18 152.22 A: mhm 

151.88 156.64 B: but i mean what is the alternative i mean they have to there has to be a solution 

156.82 159.58 B: you know it's not a matter that you can 

159.73 164.40 B: you know ignore the problem there's definitely a problem it's a high risk area 

162.86 165.07 A: yeah high risk yeah 

165.15 173.78 A: i i think that what they're doing is fine i don't i don't see anything wrong with that i'm you know i think a lot of the country was surprised that they weren't screening everybody 

174.09 175.44 B: (( exactly )) 

174.69 176.13 A: like that 

175.45 176.87 B: you know we were um 

176.97 185.99 B: we were lucky that it hasn't happened before and that's where i mean they were looking the terrorists were looking for areas that were 

179.32 180.41 A: mhm 

186.03 187.77 B: easy attack areas 

186.26 187.54 A: mhm 

188.28 196.81 B: you know personally i think it they're going to you know you see in the back of your mind what's going to happen you know hindsight is everything right 

195.98 197.56 A: right right 

197.15 197.98 B: but 

198.05 200.92 B: i think well the problem is 

200.99 202.07 B: um 

202.62 205.36 B: the terrorists they're bent on 

205.37 211.63 B: on if they're if they're crazy enough to kill themselves then they'll do anything you know so it really 

209.40 211.33 A: right 

212.18 215.23 B: i don't know how you're going to prevent such a a uh huh it's 

214.30 219.26 A: israel has had tons of security measures put in for everything 

219.29 222.21 A: and they can't prevent suicide bombers so 

223.16 224.76 A: it doesn't seem to be 

223.66 225.21 B: a scary 

225.48 229.94 B: thought that we that there's another there are human beings on this earth that act this way 

229.79 231.43 A: mhm 

231.18 232.03 B: but 

231.85 234.14 A: but most criminals 

235.08 236.19 A: are dumb 

237.31 238.60 B: well that's true 

238.45 240.23 A: and unorganized 

240.47 241.91 A: working by themselves 

243.00 244.02 A: and 

244.25 245.56 A: if we let 

246.71 251.59 A: what hap- i mean admittedly three thousand people dying is not a small thing 

251.37 252.09 B: (( no )) 

252.16 255.77 A: there are two hundred and fifty million people in this country however 

256.20 268.61 A: and i i talk to people who say that oh my god i can't fly and i say there were four thousand airplanes in the air while nine eleven was happening so even if you happen to be flying at the exact same time 

268.88 271.54 A: you had a one in one thousand chance 

271.57 273.79 A: of being on one of the four airplanes 

274.52 275.53 B: that's true 

275.52 280.36 A: mm and you know i knew a lot of people who were actually flying that day 

280.98 288.03 A: one person was going to japan overseas a couple of people were going to canada and they never even got on a plane because it happened so early in the day and 

287.79 288.54 B: (( the )) 

288.05 288.61 A: (( [cough] )) 

288.77 297.37 B: the thing that was really scary for us is we actually had people from our lab traveling from dallas and d._w._i. going to california 

288.88 290.00 A: whatever 

293.25 294.53 A: mhm 

297.12 298.15 A: wow 

297.93 299.15 B: so it was 

300.15 303.33 B: breathtaking during that day we couldn't you know i mean 

301.61 312.68 A: yeah [laughter] there was somebody from i was at the university of massachusetts at the time and there was somebody from the university of massachusetts who was on the the flight from boston that ended up in new york 

303.52 305.18 B: we were holding our 

312.84 313.85 A: um 

314.07 316.03 A: but i didn't know them 

315.03 327.60 B: that's unfortunate for us too we had an alumnus that lost not only his life but his whole family's lives on the plane that hit the pentagon so there a couple and it's hard you know so i think most people will say 

320.63 321.71 A: oh wow 

323.01 323.74 A: mm 

325.06 326.27 A: oh yeah 

327.72 335.66 B: let's do what it takes to make us safe but are we using our resources in the best possible way 

335.00 337.19 A: right yeah i'm not sure that 

335.73 337.03 B: that's the thing 

337.57 339.75 A: that there's a whole lot i mean i think 

340.11 343.78 A: making sure that people with guns and knives don't get on airplanes is good 

343.82 345.77 B: oh well that's a definite 

345.06 346.54 A: that's important 

346.62 349.53 A: but um i don't think we need to go 

349.56 352.76 A: too much further than we already have considering that 

353.35 355.92 A: you know there's a lot of other ways that you can die 

356.35 357.33 B: that's true 

357.34 370.04 B: that's true i think i i'm i'm [laughter] more worried about you know the maintenance man that puts scotch tape on a wing [laughter] than i am someone with a bomb in their shoe 

357.35 358.01 A: so 

365.98 367.41 A: (( uh huh )) 

369.69 377.73 A: i had a friend who was on an airplane and she was looking out the window and she watched the baggage cart drive into the bottom of the airplane and put a hole in it [laughter] 

376.45 377.47 B: (( oh my god )) 

377.77 380.76 A: and so they had to get everybody out the airplane and get a new airplane 

380.59 390.57 B: that's that's i think is the critical part that they forget uh you know who are the maintenance crew that are working on this airplane how many how many um 

383.56 385.48 A: yeah [laughter] 

386.87 387.85 A: right 

390.62 393.39 B: how many drinks has the pilot had 

393.03 397.23 A: right [laughter] 

393.65 398.86 B: you know [laughter] these are really simple clues that you know maybe i shouldn't fly today 

398.62 399.64 A: yeah 

398.98 400.63 B: (( you know i think )) 

400.81 406.70 B: i think we need to go back to basics and use some commonsense you know use the technology that we can 

403.65 404.55 A: yeah 

406.91 408.72 B: without breaking the bank you 

408.59 409.70 A: right 

409.09 410.68 B: (( know and i i think )) 

409.90 416.98 A: yeah and and people are like i said people are freaking out about flying on airlines but you know you're much more likely to get hit by a drunk driver 

416.77 417.61 B: right 

417.27 421.90 A: there's way many more people who are drinking in cars than there are drinking pilots 

421.95 424.19 A: you know stuff like that [cough] 

424.11 427.36 B: well i mean i think the media has a lot to play on that too 

426.86 428.54 A: oh yeah 

429.12 430.21 A: yeah 

430.50 433.00 B: so i'm not sure if the i heard a 

433.09 436.72 B: a robot come in or not because i heard a couple like a echo 

437.43 438.29 B: the 

438.47 439.70 A: i don't think so 

440.25 442.36 A: oh yeah there is something coming in there but 

442.43 446.67 A: i don't think that's our official time yet no 

444.37 445.68 B: [mn] yeah 

445.83 457.24 B: so have you have you actually gone through any of the new mechanisms that are due i know i think there's an airport in florida that already has the new baggage um x ray machine 

456.96 463.63 A: i haven't done the new baggage x rays i have i mean i've gone through airports since they switched over to federal 

463.77 464.95 B: mhm 

464.58 466.25 A: um employees 

464.96 468.39 B: do you see a um a marketable difference between 

468.21 469.91 A: there's a lot more of them 

471.26 477.20 A: there's just a lot more of them and and it was very efficient and quick i had no problems at all 

476.82 479.78 B: oh wow not even for international flights 

477.56 478.27 A: (( the )) 

480.09 483.09 A: only i haven't been international in a 

483.32 486.01 A: couple of years so i don't know 

486.05 488.28 A: but [cough] um 

486.06 486.67 B: (( mm )) 

489.49 498.25 A: the only i mean i think it was actually worse when they were doing so much more screening with the same old people who hadn't been trained on anything you know what i mean 

496.71 498.80 B: (( oh i mean it would help )) 

498.76 504.47 A: you know everything got bogged down because they didn't know what they're doing and then they hadn't hired any more staff and 

504.86 506.24 A: all that kind of stuff 

504.86 508.89 B: oh and let's how many were not even supposed to be in this country 

508.80 510.06 A: (( right )) 

509.40 515.41 B: they were you know illegal aliens doing our security checks which is 

511.83 514.00 A: mhm yeah 

515.51 516.57 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

515.53 517.87 B: uh what's wrong with this picture you know 

517.10 520.82 A: yeah their friends could be the ones who ah yeah 

520.20 525.50 B: exactly well i i i think that part of it really 

524.62 525.41 A: yeah 

525.86 526.93 B: (( um )) 

528.72 533.73 B: eases my mind that they actually have accountability about who is working there 

533.46 536.97 A: right right definitely 

535.23 536.10 B: (( so )) 

536.17 539.41 B: i- it's i would imagine very important to m- 

539.46 541.05 B: to that the person 

539.75 551.71 A: yeah it it it always amazes because nobody wants to do these security jobs nobody wants to be the night watchman you know all that kind of stuff and w- and so people are always shocked when they find out who is the night watchman because 

546.08 546.84 B: right 

551.94 554.86 A: nobody wanted that job so they had to find somebody 

555.63 559.34 B: because they they really didn't make a big deal about um 

555.96 556.72 A: so 

559.65 569.17 B: you know other than that it was um part of the homeland security that it was federal these workers were federal workers now they didn't make a big deal about how they 

563.26 564.35 A: mhm 

566.66 568.01 A: mhm 

569.36 572.53 B: how did they entice people to do such a job 

572.39 573.37 A: right 

573.22 578.08 B: you know did they automatically you didn't have a choice if you were a federal worker in the justice department 

576.02 580.77 A: well my guess is the economy was going down so it probably wasn't too difficult for it 

579.78 581.28 B: oh that's true [laughter] 

581.30 582.94 A: [laughter] 

581.74 585.50 B: all all the dotcomers are now [laughter] 

583.76 589.70 A: right yeah [laughter] screening bags for their um the friends who did whose dotcoms didn't fail 

586.24 587.58 B: [laughter] 

589.98 590.87 B: (( wow )) 

590.15 591.86 A: and are going off to other 

591.88 595.50 A: to california for some reason that's a funny thought i like that one 

594.86 600.01 B: uh it's i think it was what um what is the new a._o._l. [laughter] 

599.34 601.62 A: yeah the time warner thing 

601.11 604.93 B: yeah right [laughter] welcome to our x ray machine 

604.83 608.54 A: (( there you go [laughter] oh no )) 

605.49 607.20 B: [laughter] 

608.73 609.70 B: yeah 

609.60 611.32 A: oh my goodness 

611.14 617.30 B: i think we've done more than ten minutes but i don't think the robot is getting through correctly because 

616.52 618.76 A: well i don't think we've been ten minutes 

618.22 619.13 B: no 

618.82 620.19 A: i can't remember 

620.17 623.19 B: i thought we did i thought we started at three 

621.39 622.86 A: i know the first time i 

622.94 626.06 A: the first time i've only done three of these calls the first time 

626.19 635.59 A: we both thought that it had been ten minutes and so we hung and then the next time the second time the robot came in and i'm like oh there's a robot that's telling me what time it's done oops 

635.85 640.43 B: the first one we never heard the second one i heard and now this one 

640.65 642.35 B: i ca- i don't know 

641.27 644.52 A: it could just be interference on the line though that it could not have any 

643.85 646.99 B: yeah we have bad weather in washington d._c. right now 

646.54 651.75 A: yeah we have really drippy rainy stuff here too we're in um i'm in ah near pittsburgh so 

651.34 655.04 B: oh you're right around the corner i'm in maryland actually 

653.01 653.94 A: (( yeah )) 

655.78 660.03 B: so yes it so do you fly out of what airport 

659.77 665.59 A: um now i fly out of pittsburgh i just moved from massachusetts so i was flying out of hartford 

665.18 666.17 B: hartford 

666.02 667.61 A: i don't fly out of logan 

667.54 670.14 B: uh huh nobody wants that's like going jf- 

667.81 669.03 A: in boston 

670.30 671.45 B: j._f._k. 

670.44 675.57 A: although i did just fly to logan in um this fall in october 

675.31 676.15 B: (( uh huh )) 

676.08 682.58 A: because um i had a conference in boston but if you're just going to the airport and taking a taxi to the conference then it's not the same 

683.32 685.75 A: because getting to logan logan is 

686.38 688.89 A: in the middle of the city on the water 

688.68 689.54 B: (( oh )) 

689.67 690.95 B: you don't have a choice 

690.68 695.91 A: yeah so you have to go through all the downtown traffic and everything horrible to get out 

696.83 697.90 A: which is 

697.29 702.59 B: that's almost like um what's called reagan national now used to be the washington international airport 

700.24 701.30 A: (( yes )) 

701.36 702.36 A: yeah 

702.61 711.74 B: that's impossible to get out of that's why most people i'm surprised it's still open it's open because of the senators and congressmen that's the only reason really to tell you the truth 

704.94 706.31 A: right 

708.61 710.04 A: yeah yes 

710.37 714.38 A: they've talked about closing it a bunch of times especially after that guy drove into the white house with the 

713.66 714.91 B: oh yeah 

714.56 715.48 A: airplane 

715.13 715.82 B: so 

715.98 717.07 B: (( so um )) 

717.92 719.89 B: most of the people well
