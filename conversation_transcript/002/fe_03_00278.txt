34.90 39.32 B: yeah it's being used to develop models for conversational speech recognition 

39.18 50.57 A: that's what i thought and so you know they they're wanting samples where for example we talk over each other correct i mean and and and no but i mean uh to see if like a conversational sort of 

45.13 47.00 B: well not necessarily 

50.55 55.31 A: speech recognition software would be able to handle those sort of real life events correct 

54.23 62.59 B: well i think one of the other things that's interesting is uh the the study of disfluencies you notice i stuttered a little bit there an- and that will be

145.35 146.29 A: mhm 

146.83 148.17 B: and i said no 

148.30 155.97 B: and they said well it's happened you know and described it briefly and i said oh i really miss not being able to see c._n._n. 

156.09 158.92 B: because my hosts didn't have c._n._n. 

159.14 163.37 B: and he said well we have it [laughter] he was in an adjoining farm 

163.63 169.64 B: and so i spent about two days maybe three days watching c._n._n. and just 

168.94 169.66 A: (( oh )) 

169.78 173.43 B: being uh appalled and astonished 

172.45 174.17 A: right right 

173.73 176.22 B: and then i tried to get back to the states 

176.07 176.80 A: oh 

177.24 178.76 B: it was um 

180.16 185.26 B: it was uh an adventure i went from oslo to to uh 

185.41 186.52 B: copenhagen 

186.33 187.33 A: mhm 

187.16 189.59 B: uh which i'd been scheduled to do 

189.88 194.02 B: uh i did it a couple of days later than had been scheduled 

194.25 202.02 B: and then when i got to copenhagen they said well we n- we're not sure we can get you back to the united states but we can probably get you as far as london 

202.53 203.51 A: mhm 

203.01 205.97 B: [laughter] so i went to london and uh 

206.31 213.71 B: uh i missed my connection i i was told uh that was at heathrow 

209.14 210.12 A: aye 

214.16 218.78 B: i was told that they could uh get me on a flight back to the states in a week 

219.92 221.44 B: no sooner than a week 

221.31 224.11 A: wow and so you were stuck in london for a week 

224.04 225.77 B: yes what a hardship 

225.52 227.94 A: [laughter] 

227.27 236.88 B: [laughter] actually i called my office and explained the circumstance and they said well uh don't worry about the expense or anything uh just get back safely 

236.77 237.70 A: wow 

237.40 241.31 B: and uh so ah the i went to a hotel that the 

241.71 243.96 B: uh airline had sent me to 

244.03 247.12 B: and as it turns out i got the airline's rate 

244.12 245.00 A: mhm 

247.14 249.76 B: which was i think forty nine pounds 

247.44 248.31 A: mhm 

249.97 253.62 B: uh which is less than a hundred dollars a night 

250.78 251.67 A: wow 

252.63 253.60 A: right 

253.74 256.57 A: that's very cheap for london i was just there this summer 

255.91 259.18 B: yeah so i had a nice a nice visit in london 

259.78 263.08 A: no and uh yeah all things considered right yeah 

262.14 268.00 B: yeah i think the the thinking about the issues though i think the probability of 

268.09 269.17 B: um 

270.16 272.70 B: there being uh an air 

273.30 281.61 B: problem that any one is personally involved with is is not much greater than it was before maybe a little less 

277.09 277.95 A: mhm 

280.20 280.97 A: sure 

281.75 284.76 B: because of all the heightened security 

284.17 294.51 A: yeah i think the heightened security a lot of it is you know show and no go i mean it's really they still haven't started xraying all luggage for example i mean 

294.63 302.04 A: um yeah they they they they don't xray all checked luggage yet they still don't 

301.33 304.49 B: oh well i tell you they did when i came back from london 

303.64 309.96 A: so yeah um but you know they i mean a sort of domestic air flights now just they don't 

304.94 305.93 B: uh 

309.58 310.30 B: oh 

310.19 313.80 A: they don't they they're they're they're not equipped to do this and um 

313.85 315.42 A: (( [sigh] and it's )) 

315.67 326.77 A: it's not i i read a great quote in the new york times yesterday morning because apparently someone in [lipsmack] uh had placed little boxes throughout the union square 

326.94 332.84 A: station um they were tiny black boxes with the words beer inscribed on them 

332.85 340.04 A: and they were there were there were several of them there were probably about a dozen of them and they were just placed in locations throughout the union square subway station 

340.08 344.94 A: and they were affixed on walls and kind of up in corners and stuff like that 

344.91 359.09 A: and so finally someone pointed out to the transit authorities these were there and and to the police and then they went in and they evacuated the station and everything and there was a comment from someone who was a graduate student in new york who was from israel and he 

359.12 362.01 A: basically said something to the effect of you know 

362.85 375.98 A: you people have an awful lot to learn like if this had happened in tel aviv ah we would have had a robot go in there and take care of it in five minutes either it would have detonated it or you know found out it was nothing and gotten it outta there the robot would have done it you know [laughter] 

373.42 374.26 B: yeah 

375.88 381.08 B: i don't know if they would have done it in five minutes though the the problem is uh one of scale 

381.16 384.24 B: um if if you attack many 

384.33 387.20 B: you know places at once ah 

387.72 390.56 B: gee whiz uh one of them might go off 

389.09 389.86 A: (( yeah )) 

390.38 392.43 A: well you know when i was in london 

392.53 393.30 A: um 

394.05 398.06 A: i remember actually going to westminster abbey and uh 

398.26 404.08 A: having uh had a sandwich i was trying to look for some place to dispose of a sandwich wrapper 

403.61 404.82 B: (( mhm )) 

404.20 409.92 A: um and i couldn't find any there was none in westminster station i looked around and then i looked around in the 

410.01 417.39 A: all the street corners surrounding the station and when i got up above ground there were none and i walked over past the houses of parliament and there were no 

414.07 415.29 B: oh that's right [laughter] 

417.27 425.13 A: [laughter] and then i finally walked into westminster abbey and i walked to the information desk and i said i'm really sorry but uh is there some place i could find a trash can 

425.14 437.30 A: and they promptly informed me that uh there was one rubbish rubbish bin outside the door but um if but that if but that 'cause i said honestly i really have been trying uh to 

437.36 445.07 A: (( look for about twenty minutes for some place to uh discard this and i haven't been able to find any oh no there are no rubbish bins in the station )) 

445.12 448.87 A: (( and then they said it's a perfect place to place an i._r._a. bomb )) 

445.48 447.17 B: well i had that in london 

448.66 452.32 B: yeah it's an i._r._a. thing their their 

450.55 451.80 A: oh totally 

452.62 456.74 B: their security is heightened by the irish terrorism 

456.41 463.22 A: right oh well their se- you know our security just is laughable compared to theirs you know and they still have bombs going off so 

463.27 467.42 A: um i mean if somebody really wanted to do it and what american's don't understand 

467.87 470.90 A: [laughter] i think is that uh 

471.90 474.87 A: okay you make it more difficult but 

475.15 477.08 A: it's sort of like these sorts of 

477.53 478.38 A: uh 

478.62 480.86 A: plans take a lot of patience 

481.18 485.40 A: and also a lot of persistence and sort of like okay well now 

485.51 499.25 A: you know you're just gonna have to be more careful to do something like this but if if if we're not actually screening all the luggage okay as you say just send in you know eighteen in- incendiary devices in the luggage and if oh 

499.28 501.58 A: five of them happened to be caught by random 

502.00 503.84 A: thirteen of 'em still go off 

503.48 505.08 B: yeah 

505.22 514.19 A: it's just yeah no i don't particularly think of airport security as all that great you know on the other hand it's sort of like what really are the odds 

514.51 523.08 A: of uh you know you're buying it and you get in a vehicle off the lot it's a lot greater if you get into a car than if you get in a plane that's still statistically true 

523.49 528.00 A: so i mean i- it remains you know quite statistically true so 

527.16 529.13 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

528.79 529.66 A: um 

529.91 533.56 A: [mn] no but i don't think airport security's really terribly good 

533.88 537.89 A: (( um still and uh i think that um )) 

538.38 542.08 A: think it's just people being inconvenienced now but uh 

542.48 545.06 A: (( i i'm not really sure )) 

545.95 547.01 B: well i think 

546.19 548.07 A: how much better security is 

546.90 557.34 B: what's desirable is to have some security measures that do provide some deterrent and and yet that people will accept 

553.88 554.79 A: right 

557.17 558.20 A: right but 

557.21 565.89 B: and we're just ridiculously uh free and open about travel and you know i was at um 

562.28 563.07 A: right 

563.09 564.26 A: right 

566.51 569.13 B: mcdonald's yesterday morning f- 

569.25 576.37 B: to get some breakfast stuff i don't normally do that but we didn't have electric power in our house so 

570.94 571.76 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

572.58 573.67 A: mhm 

577.16 587.98 B: so uh there's a woman ahead of me in line with two children uh that was ordering her breakfast and it came to ten dollars and fifty six cents if i remember 

588.13 594.09 B: and uh she looked at the money she had and she had said i only have nine dollars 

588.31 589.12 A: mhm 

594.37 595.25 A: mhm 

594.72 601.52 B: a- and uh the man uh ahead of me just reached in his wallet and han- handed her two dollars 

601.97 606.25 B: we're just i mean a generous society 

601.99 602.84 A: mhm 

605.57 608.22 A: mhm yeah we're an open society basically 

606.91 607.68 B: yeah 

608.55 610.31 A: so um 

610.40 622.41 A: and the paradox that people don't understand is that we're an open society within our with our within our own borders but that part of the reason i think why this has been happening is because 

622.43 624.97 A: um the way that things happen here 

625.16 629.95 A: is not the way that america handles our affairs in 

630.23 635.11 A: on the world stage i mean america is known in many corners of the world as being incredibly 

635.15 635.79 A: (( uh )) 

636.58 639.52 A: repressive and and incredibly brutal 

639.62 644.30 A: um and we do that in the name of preserving that kind of openness 

643.96 644.86 B: yeah 

644.20 654.71 A: within our own shores but we don't know what it looks like to other people we we we don't see that um and and it's when you start to live and travel abroad uh 

654.99 662.44 A: i think you get a much better sense of that and that's the only america that a lot of that the that most people in the world know most people who are not us 

662.15 663.42 B: mhm 

662.83 663.44 A: (( um )) 

663.65 665.09 A: and uh 

665.14 670.42 A: it's it's this enormous paradox that we're willing to go to very extreme lengths of of 

670.85 671.52 A: (( um )) 

671.72 674.14 A: our our government certainly 

673.05 674.89 B: you were born in the united states 

674.59 676.26 A: (( i was i was )) 

676.02 678.19 B: uh-huh and you've traveled abroad though 

676.46 677.45 A: (( but ah )) 

678.40 683.82 A: yeah and i've lived abroad as well but our government is is willing to go to um enormous 

684.21 687.67 A: uh lengths in defensive um 

687.86 690.51 A: [lipsmack] what we decide are american interests 

690.23 694.73 B: how would you feel about going to a third world country like 

690.86 692.22 A: (( um abroad )) 

694.17 695.88 A: i did live in a third world country 

695.44 697.75 B: uh one of the african states 

697.54 700.34 A: (( no not one of the african states in asia yeah but uh )) 

698.40 699.30 B: asian 

699.73 700.59 B: uh-huh 

701.85 706.34 A: you know and and so it's it's very hard for us to understand i think 

706.42 719.90 A: a lot how what this what this looks like to other people you know [lipsmack] when you explain to american's like remember the popular kid in high school you know [laughter] remember the popular kids who seemed to have it all going on and you know seemed to always get what they wanted and
