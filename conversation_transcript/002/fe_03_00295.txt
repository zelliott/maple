0.25 1.40 A: (( hello )) 

0.93 3.17 B: hello hi my name's sven 

2.83 4.95 A: (( hi my name is danya how are you )) 

4.27 6.14 B: hi i'm good 

5.88 11.37 A: all right so we're supposed to talk about um if we think that airport security is pu- um 

11.38 14.56 A: what does it what is it what was it 

13.38 18.79 B: um just like ah whether improvements like terrorism i guess is that the idea 

18.29 20.29 A: yeah um 

18.81 19.71 B: okay 

20.55 23.00 A: (( do you want to go first mhm )) 

21.28 22.86 B: yeah sure um 

22.74 37.64 B: i think like just based on all those studies right after nine eleven um about like how much stuff you could get past security and i mean this is like this was when it was like security was at it's most like way highest you know like a lot of stuff has like become a lot more lax since then 

37.50 50.75 B: like i think just based on those studies i don't think they're really effective because people got like you know knives and like explosives and all kinds of shit across like that wasn't like supposed to so just basically 

49.79 57.17 A: i don't know if they um i felt like maybe like from when i hear- i heard about the studies and i heard that they came through with like um 

57.30 60.34 A: maybe like knives and stuff like that i didn't know about explosives [laughter] 

60.13 66.37 B: oh it's ah i'm pretty sure like i heard about ah you know what it that's kind of like i guess the sort of thing that might have 

66.15 75.19 B: gotten like exaggerated as time went on um maybe it wasn't exactly explosives yeah but there were certainly like definitely weapons that got past and i'm almost 

68.44 69.55 A: (( oh mhm )) 

75.22 79.78 B: certain that i heard about guns or you know that kind of thing getting past so 

79.53 94.12 A: well you know like i don't understand like i thought like they take so much precaution into like protecting people's safety and doing so many like charts and going through the the detectors and all that i don't understand how people can still 

94.15 101.90 A: go inside go inside a airplane with ah harmful object i don't i don't i still don't understand that like mm mm 

100.98 106.67 B: um yeah that's true like just from your own personal experience right like going to the airport and going through all those checks and stuff 

106.69 107.81 B: um 

107.75 119.68 B: i'm not really sure like you wonder if they somehow bypass the security through like some kind of like you know they somehow get past the guard without having to go through metal detectors or they actually get through the metal detectors without 

119.49 125.13 B: i mean i guess there there will be like ways that you could just conceal it so they couldn't see it in an the x rays somehow 

125.23 127.78 B: if they like camouflage or something i don't know 

128.04 129.87 B: i'm not really sure but 

128.95 134.89 A: yeah i don't know i think like well you know it makes people i guess it makes people feel a lot safer 

134.51 135.77 B: mhm 

135.07 139.46 A: still like doing the checks you know i think me- i don't i don't think everyone d- 

139.48 146.46 A: wants to get through with um you know with a harmful object will be able to because i know like 

146.49 158.96 A: um they when they were doing the studies they um they didn't get through with it all of the time just some of the time so i guess like turn out like some people who care who um you know turn out 

151.52 152.44 B: mhm 

159.05 164.43 A: people who do have um guns and stuff with um like people 

162.39 163.30 B: (( mhm uh huh )) 

164.68 167.23 A: i mean like i'm trying to say like o'hare 

168.11 174.46 A: people um i guess like not everyone can get you can't luckily you can't fool them all the time but like 

174.69 177.62 A: some of the time they can you know be caught 

176.23 180.17 B: mm right like the shoe bomber for example yeah 

178.71 182.66 A: yeah basically um i don't know i think like 

183.20 187.84 A: i think it's i i don't know i i feel very safer i'd feel safer if um 

188.22 197.53 A: you know we do do people complain a lot how the air- the lines are so long and all these um like precautions like i just feel like a lot safer you know 

193.05 193.81 B: (( yeah uh )) 

197.14 197.95 B: huh 

197.89 209.92 A: and um you just i i just i just feel i just feel better about it and people were complaining like the lady couldn't even take a comb like cause it was awfully sharp i thought that was funny she was complaining about that 

207.57 208.97 B: oh yeah [laughter] yeah yeah 

209.92 219.16 A: so i i'm sure they go they like when the first the first september eleven first happened i'm sure like they were really like really really harsher than like nothing 

219.27 221.26 A: (( like you're not even allowed a sharp pen )) 

222.08 227.54 A: but i'm sure like maybe and i don't know i haven't traveled lately i'm sure now they're a little bit more lax or something 

227.09 240.22 B: mhm yeah like they um i was just at the airport a few days ago they um they brought like you know the curb check in and stuff and that's supposed to be one of like the first things that really should have gone because like it's a lot less safe to do that instead of 

233.13 234.17 A: mhm 

239.55 240.54 A: the what 

240.28 241.92 B: ah the curb check ins 

242.10 243.23 A: curb check ins 

242.53 251.49 B: where ah like ah i it's for like sidewalk check in or whatever as soon as you got there they take your luggage and apparently they don't 

246.47 247.95 A: oh okay okay 

249.42 250.37 A: mhm 

251.62 259.01 B: check those as well as ah if you actually bring it up to the counter so and that's supposed to be pretty unsafe but 

255.90 256.72 A: (( mm )) 

259.41 261.69 A: they've got to actually go through your bags right 

262.00 265.07 B: do they go through your ba- do do they go through all the bags 

264.46 268.04 A: no i mean they have random checks of the ba- bags right 

267.72 271.24 B: yeah yeah yeah i think so i guess 

271.38 272.09 B: (( so )) 

272.49 274.19 B: um 

272.51 275.30 A: i think i thought i heard that they did because um 

275.62 281.70 A: i don't know i just thought like randomly they would just you know check people's bags and mhm 

281.21 287.85 B: uh huh yeah that wouldn't surprise me but um i i guess like to really answer the question like 

287.80 297.49 B: i know this sounds kind of vague but it almost seems like if someone wanted to really do it if someone got around to organize such a thing for years like they could get past security 

296.91 298.31 A: oh definitely 

297.57 304.87 B: yeah so that's like that's kind of like i i mean if someone who is kind of an amateur maybe like a shoe bomber for example you know 

304.74 316.98 B: could get caught easily but i mean if you have like twelve people supported by like a massive terrorist organisation it seems almost unstoppable like mere airport security it's like that's the kind of thing that troubles me 

316.94 320.66 A: yeah ah yeah it's true like people will um 

320.89 322.98 A: if they want to really want to do it like 

323.42 328.69 A: they could i mean like they did have airport security before sep- september eleven and look what happened you know 

328.29 329.55 B: (( yeah yeah uh )) 

329.16 331.54 A: but i guess like they just heightened it up 

331.95 334.22 A: you know a little bit or 

333.22 333.96 B: huh 

334.45 335.83 A: whatever to 

335.90 341.08 A: just have a little people pe- put people's minds at ease or something 

340.05 341.27 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

341.40 342.59 A: and i think 

343.64 347.52 A: um i just fr- for me i just feel i feel safer just like 

348.36 351.69 A: the um airport security is even though it's a pain [laughter] 

351.24 352.19 B: (( uh huh )) 

351.76 353.81 A: waiting in line all that time 

353.18 354.77 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

354.45 355.85 A: i just feel better 

355.41 363.67 B: yeah it's okay like i usually get there like two hours early anyway regardless so i mean if i have to wait a little more for security it's not such a big deal i guess 

363.86 365.82 A: do you travel a lot 

365.26 368.99 B: um i travel ah well i'm in college right now 

369.01 369.98 A: me too 

370.23 373.86 B: oh okay okay are we all college students i'm not sure in this

470.22 471.28 A: yeah 

477.28 478.72 A: i have no clue

493.35 494.42 A: yeah 

493.82 498.56 B: yeah okay well i guess we can talk more about airport security um 

498.78 501.70 B: do do you think ah another attack will come soon 

501.85 503.08 A: um 

503.29 506.20 A: i don't think so i don't know i don't know why it feels 

506.23 510.70 A: like that you can't be too over confident it's not that i'm over confident i just feel like 

511.38 517.71 A: even i- i don't i don't i don't know i just don't feel like it's going if it's going to come i don't think it's going to come any time soon 

517.69 518.61 B: okay 

518.00 520.42 A: i really don't and um 

521.15 526.48 A: i was thinking about bin laden and um what's his what's his name hussein 

526.37 527.20 B: yeah 

526.57 527.80 A: getting together 

527.75 529.10 B: [laughter] 

528.46 536.17 A: [laughter] and i was thinking well then like they'll be like that'll be pretty weird that'll be pretty weird but it's like maybe they're friends 

529.32 529.94 B: (( uh huh )) 

536.52 538.47 A: maybe they have coffee together or something 

538.12 539.43 B: (( [laughter] coffee )) 

538.49 541.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

540.55 542.45 B: american buy coffee 

542.65 543.54 B: (( right )) 

542.93 545.44 A: do do you think another attack is going to come soon 

545.22 558.35 B: oh gosh come i don't like okay i just read like i don't know there's all these like whatever studies to predict they'll come like the next month or something um i don't i don't think it will be at least for another year or so 

558.50 561.15 B: but i mean it just seems like 

561.10 575.78 B: they want to they they're very eager to do something again and now like the pressure's kind off el qaida because i mean i don't really know how true that is in terms of like actual government work um but like it seems like the focus is so much iraq now that like 

575.74 580.23 B: ah bin laden might seize this as an opportunity to you know like try to get our attention again 

579.64 581.50 A: mhm 

580.59 582.64 B: so like i don't 

581.53 583.59 A: yeah that's true that's very true 

583.25 590.41 B: like he tried something in singapore that kind of didn't work so i mean i don't know what he was doing there but like i think he 

590.93 598.34 B: he likes being in the spotlight and he hasn't really said anything lately probably because he wants to make us think that he's dead or something 

598.11 601.22 A: i don't think he's dead for real i really don't think he's dead 

599.42 603.83 B: oh no he's yeah he's definite because um yeah they just released some evidence that he's alive 

603.46 604.58 A: oh really 

603.99 606.49 B: yeah like some tapes um 

606.86 607.75 B: (( yeah uh )) 

607.34 611.10 A: i think i heard of them but i wasn't sure if it was really valid or not 

610.80 618.36 B: huh um i think yeah i read like a times article it seemed pretty valid um and that sort of stuff so 

618.62 619.61 A: (( mm )) 

619.19 620.72 B: um 

620.62 624.25 A: yeah i i really didn't like as much as i would like i mean i mean 

624.20 636.33 A: i'm not a cruel person but i feel as though that he shouldn't die so easily [laughter] i mean i think it i believe in cruel and unusual punishment for him [laughter] you know i'm 

625.73 626.64 B: (( uh huh )) 

628.71 629.57 B: oh 

629.80 631.43 B: [laughter] you should like 

635.33 637.16 B: (( [laughter] oh man oh )) 

636.35 640.34 A: i'm really serious like he's should like be burnt alive or something 

640.00 641.68 B: [laughter] 

641.35 644.67 A: (( i know that's kind of that's kind of heinous but like )) 

644.81 649.07 A: he did like terrible things so i'm just i'm not amused by him 

647.22 648.32 B: (( uh huh oh )) 

648.67 656.15 B: okay well i'm n- i'm not really a proponent for the death penalty so if we just like left him in a jail for a while or forever 

652.10 653.09 A: [laughter] 

655.07 656.90 A: you want you want to leave him in a jail 

656.52 660.31 B: yeah sure i mean i'm sure the guards will torture him a little bit 

660.10 663.51 A: they should i mean like even if he doesn't die i think he should be tortured 

663.35 664.89 B: [laughter] 

663.84 666.60 A: oh definitely he really should be tortured 

666.23 667.24 B: (( oh )) 

667.45 673.12 B: um yeah so i don't know what do you think the chances are that saddam will do something like that i think it 

674.02 675.67 B: right 

675.02 676.41 A: um 

676.49 682.27 B: i mean that's just like way beyond anything that like any civility that's i mean that would just be asking for all out war so 

682.56 687.41 A: yeah i i don't know i don't i think saddam i feel like he has a lot of like 

687.79 694.96 A: he has a lot of like a lot of i don't think he's a man of like action like that i mean he is but i don't feel like he'll 

695.63 702.23 A: i don't think he'll risk it um with the get in war with us i don't i really don't think he'll like 

696.93 697.78 B: (( uh huh )) 

702.29 706.59 A: he'll risk it because he has you know he has a lot to lose everything 

705.41 709.22 B: oh yeah definitely yeah um 

707.50 710.97 A: so i really like he just should give us his um 

711.52 716.36 A: what is it his ah nuclear weapons i guess they are like he is allowing 

716.57 719.89 A: the um with allowing u._n. to go in and 

719.43 719.95 B: (( oh yeah ))
