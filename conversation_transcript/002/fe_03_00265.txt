73.54 78.83 A: and my mother really doesn't want me to go outside and plan on living outside the country 

78.96 79.32 A: so 

80.44 82.16 A: that is kind of like a big 

82.27 82.93 A: main 

83.06 85.27 A: shift focus of how i'm going to 

86.02 86.39 A: um 

86.75 87.62 A: and where i'm going to live 

87.72 88.89 A: out my life doing 

89.11 89.63 A: different work

97.63 98.00 B: oh 

99.22 99.66 A: so 

99.79 104.23 A: i i still probably will go live in brazil but i was thinking about going to live in africa 

104.74 105.74 A: my mom's not really 

105.21 107.24 B: where where where about in africa 

107.81 110.74 A: well um i work with a group of women here 

110.88 112.78 A: in portland and um 

113.56 114.80 A: we built a clinic 

115.03 116.37 A: in uh 

116.86 119.63 A: it's called (( shwela )) it's outside of nairobi in kenya 

120.10 120.43 B: oh 

120.28 122.31 A: and it serves over ten thousand families 

122.67 127.86 A: so i wanted to go and visit the clinic and maybe stay there and work at the clinic and then get to know some of the people there 

128.47 128.90 A: and then 

129.01 130.84 A: come back and do some more fund raising 

131.48 132.66 A: and uh 

133.68 136.94 A: i still may do it i mean it has been like over a year 

137.82 138.35 A: so 

139.02 140.31 A: that's something that i 

140.49 143.04 A: don't have on my list of things to do but 

144.25 144.98 A: it's not as 

145.96 147.57 A: big of a push as it was before 

147.76 148.91 A: nine one one i think 

149.70 150.31 A: how about you 

151.44 153.79 B: well i definitely 

155.41 157.18 B: slightly more apprehensive 

158.15 160.12 B: yeah i mean i've i've flown about 

161.75 162.58 B: twice 

162.85 166.71 B: actually i just went to arizona for thanksgiving with my sister 

167.33 168.17 B: her family 

168.96 170.53 B: and i mean i don't 

170.98 175.20 B: freak out or anything but um definitely you think about it a lot more 

175.63 177.17 B: and actually i was um 

177.92 179.09 B: i work with uh 

180.01 181.36 B: a gentleman that uh 

182.51 185.13 B: whose daughter was a stewardess on uh 

185.58 186.39 B: the american flight 

187.06 187.64 B: eleven 

188.10 189.09 A: oh gosh 

188.71 191.26 B: so that that was you know a little tough and 

191.41 191.76 B: you know 

192.46 196.77 B: living on this on the east coast and having tons of friends in new york and 

197.72 198.52 B: that was uh 

199.06 201.00 B: you know a little bit much 

201.09 201.59 A: right 

201.87 204.58 B: you know and definitely trying to spend more time with family 

208.08 213.93 A: i don't really think i changed emotionally after that except for the fact that i feel like i'm just constantly living 

214.11 215.77 A: fear but that's of course what they want 

215.86 216.15 A: so 

216.61 217.87 A: can't really give in to that 

219.09 220.94 A: but uh it is really j- 

221.13 222.55 A: scary i mean and then 

222.82 224.43 A: of course now they're checking all sorts of 

224.54 229.57 A: stupid things like in movie theaters here in portland like for your bags like to see if you have guns and 

230.28 233.70 A: you know bombs and stuff which i think is really kind of over kill but 

230.52 230.92 B: mhm 

234.49 235.48 A: i suppose it's better just 

234.90 235.28 B: um 

235.72 236.97 A: check for weapons anyway 

238.19 238.56 B: yeah 

238.99 240.77 B: definitely things have changed 

242.38 243.19 B: and you know 

243.41 244.27 B: hopefully 

245.37 245.75 B: you know 

247.19 248.79 B: we we all can get through it 

249.03 249.80 B: and uh 

250.80 251.19 B: not 

251.66 256.68 B: lost our lifestyle because that's my greatest fear is that what has made this country 

257.28 259.19 B: what it is is because of 

257.51 257.90 A: right 

259.46 259.85 B: you know 

260.83 261.25 B: freedom 

264.42 267.93 A: right that's true but see the scary thing is i think it's almost like 

268.47 271.91 A: when you think about losing civil liberties and things you also have to think about 

272.06 274.79 A: what kind of people we're dealing with i mean they could care less 

274.30 274.78 B: true 

274.88 275.15 B: true 

275.43 277.41 A: whether you know we think that 

275.48 275.74 B: yeah 

277.53 278.00 A: they should 

278.51 285.48 A: even have a trial i mean because like in iran and iraq and other places as far as i know and of course i haven't personally experienced 

285.98 287.14 A: uh anything 

287.67 293.57 A: over there but i mean from what i gather in the media i mean they don't have a free press and they don't have free trials and 

294.20 294.87 A: they don't have 

295.12 296.05 A: things that are 

296.69 300.56 A: that are at all like so just the whole system is so completely different 

301.71 302.27 A: stifling 

303.01 303.87 B: true true 

304.62 306.06 B: (( )) 

306.29 312.25 B: right now with kenya in the news and i can understand why your mom would be a little bit apprehensive 

308.96 309.53 A: yeah 

311.70 312.61 A: yeah 

313.43 315.23 B: given what happened uh 

316.39 317.37 A: at that hotel 

316.60 320.75 B: with embassy bombing and then with this new attack on the israeli 

320.94 322.13 B: uh hotel

369.54 371.92 A: yeah actually wallaf that's my next language 

372.31 375.72 B: oh really well if you go to kenya you got to speak swahili 

376.43 377.69 A: right exactly 

377.96 379.33 A: yeah the east african countries 

377.99 378.29 B: yeah 

380.97 381.54 B: that's right 

381.19 381.48 A: (( )) 

382.28 384.95 A: but wallaf isn't that like a mix of different 

385.30 386.39 A: actual travel 

386.72 388.28 A: travel languages that's what afric- 

388.40 389.35 A: people were telling me 

390.05 390.93 A: like it's a whole 

390.56 391.14 B: well it's it's 

391.46 392.37 B: well it's it's it's 

392.68 394.72 B: pretty much unique to senegal 

395.48 399.20 B: but um i parts of the gambia also speak 

399.75 400.28 B: speak that 

402.24 407.78 A: but i really like being able to at least speak french and stuff i mean i speak portuguese and spanish and italian too so 

408.32 409.28 B: wow excellent 

408.67 408.97 A: (( )) 

409.57 410.85 A: yeah like over there 

411.03 411.69 A: with all the 

412.13 413.72 A: colonial people being 

415.58 418.99 A: the ones that left some languages besides the african languages it just made 

419.20 422.58 A: things so much easier when i could speak french so and ask them all about the 

423.41 427.62 A: different things that happened in their country because they give the tourists a different version too for one thing 

427.75 428.19 B: true 

428.31 428.73 B: true 

429.64 435.20 A: well that's the kind of stuff i think about with nine one one i just hope that people will not become suddenly all cut off and 

435.59 438.71 A: um but the thing is though i can tell you that really bothers me 

439.07 441.16 A: when you're kind of like overly p._c. 

441.80 442.21 B: mhm 

442.46 443.13 A: i think that 

443.24 444.36 A: a lot of those things 

445.05 445.89 A: like um 

446.46 447.62 A: if the terrorists had had 

448.17 448.81 A: the 

448.96 450.19 A: the same civil liberties 

451.12 457.30 A: like they do like we do over here that's the reason why they were protected why their computers didn't even get raided 

457.53 460.33 A: although people in the c._i._a. or f._b._i. had 

460.91 461.88 A: like uh 

462.56 463.11 A: already 

463.47 466.51 A: mounting evidence against moussawi for example and 

466.74 469.40 A: other people um that were on that flight 

469.68 470.05 A: so 

470.92 471.25 B: yeah 

471.73 474.68 B: it it it's um and i agree uh it 

474.80 475.32 B: but it's just 

475.85 476.78 B: (( )) 

477.16 477.53 B: uh 

478.35 480.66 B: of what we have to track because uh 

480.92 481.43 A: yeah 

481.00 483.22 B: it could very well be a very slippery slope 

484.05 484.47 B: that 

484.75 485.30 B: (( you know )) 

485.80 486.67 A: do you still support 

485.95 489.71 B: you have a choice oh well could i deal with big brother and 

489.83 491.55 A: right right oh no i totally agree 

489.85 490.12 B: you know 

491.94 494.13 A: yeah the big brother factor is very scary 

494.86 496.22 A: but what about um 

496.49 498.46 A: supporting the a._c._l._u. do you still 

498.58 499.72 A: support the a._c._l._u. 

500.81 502.40 B: do i support oh yeah i do 

503.08 503.74 A: yeah i do too 

503.36 503.96 B: i mean i 

504.68 507.06 B: i i do i i think the 

507.21 511.31 B: you always have to have the appropriate checks and balances 

512.06 512.50 A: right 

512.07 514.03 B: because if if you don't 

514.17 520.04 B: sometimes things might run am- amok you know you hear stories about activists being arrested in 

520.26 520.85 B: egypt 

521.35 526.44 B: in um china and and in those places they'll have checks and balances 

526.71 527.15 A: right 

528.15 529.15 A: they just have torture 

529.65 530.22 B: that's right 

530.45 531.01 B: that's right
