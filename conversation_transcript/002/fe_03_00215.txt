89.69 102.97 A: all right well that's good that's good so w- what again this i'm trying to stick to stick to the subject what um what did you look for be- what did you uh look for um in a wife so to speak and what did you see in her 

94.87 95.71 B: yeah 

100.63 101.58 B: well 

102.63 110.74 B: sure um well uh let's see so i so i'm i'm p. c. student right so i'm hav- gonna be eventually 

110.39 112.11 A: mhm 

110.77 125.66 B: um so i'm in school so i i was looking for some- somebody you know for somebody in the same kind of social station also like a student or going into school or something so that you know we could kind of be in the same stage in life you know 

121.10 122.84 A: mhm 

124.84 126.41 A: okay okay 

125.71 132.98 B: and um you know do like kind of share my um like religious beliefs and you know my 

132.94 145.40 B: kind of you know probably like m- more like you know like interests like sports and and um you know movies and books and stuff so um but that was kind of less important than 

141.76 143.59 A: mhm 

145.30 152.74 B: you know looks looks made a difference [laughter] i mean if you can't be attracted to someone then it's kind of kinda you know there's no point in in 

149.46 151.46 A: mhm yeah 

152.98 159.96 A: mhm so one thing that that was a an important factor was that you pretty much had to 

153.18 154.27 B: in pursuing 

158.37 167.82 B: it was- it wasn't necessarily a precondition right so like if if i didn't see myself being you know interested in a person 

167.89 174.10 B: i mean there's there's two things right interested in a person as as a person you know to talk to and also as a person to 

174.12 179.86 B: you know to be my future wife and i just didn't wanna you know there was no point in 

176.89 178.62 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

179.92 182.92 B: in in pursuing the relationship 

182.39 183.71 A: and so um 

182.96 185.19 B: beyond like you know just getting together 

184.98 186.19 A: (( hm )) 

186.33 193.70 A: so if you met if i understand you correctly um it was important that you both be in the same um 

193.88 197.24 A: going through the same thing so to speak than have 

195.67 198.30 B: yeah more or less right right i- 

197.46 199.20 A: yeah 

198.20 209.19 B: i- it's funny actually 'cause she she's a little older than me a couple of years older so i i didn't know that you know i didn't realize it when i when i when i we just first met i mean it came out a few a few a 

202.23 203.07 A: uh-huh 

204.69 206.02 A: [laughter] okay 

208.60 209.50 A: uh-huh 

208.98 216.04 B: few days later but you know it was actually kind of funny like um how things worked out but yeah i was it it it's like um 

213.41 215.24 A: (( hm )) 

216.38 224.20 B: so i like i've i've dated women that they were like you know in the professional world you know like doing you know working for a few years and stuff 

221.20 223.21 A: mhm mhm 

224.05 234.90 B: and that just you know it just had different kind of schedules priorities exactly yeah how 'bout yourself are you like are you in- involved in like a long term thing or 

227.04 230.35 A: priorities so to speak yeah mhm 

234.60 242.49 A: [sigh] ah yeah um it's actually um one of my good friends um we've been friends for about two years now 

242.05 243.28 B: mhm 

242.96 245.83 A: and so uh i think we're beginning to 

245.87 247.85 A: beginning to really click and stuff 

247.41 248.36 B: cool 

248.02 257.99 A: and so um [mn] let's see i don't s- still haven't reached the stage where we're gonna explore anything or at least not yet but uh 

254.77 255.58 B: i see 

258.16 266.91 A: we're mak- maybe my guess that i'm taking my time we're taking our time because we don't wanna mess it up if you will at the m- bef- 

264.91 268.90 B: (( sure h- h- how how old are you how old are you if uh you don't mind )) 

268.26 269.47 A: i'm thirty two 

269.28 273.91 B: cool okay s- so w- w- what are you looking for or were you looking for 

269.94 271.44 A: yeah 

273.92 276.06 A: well um [sigh] 

276.33 280.36 A: uh it's really difficult to say but i do look look for um 

280.38 289.52 A: uh certain things and one one thing that you you uh um i'm looking for someone that's pretty much in the living the same type of lifestyle 

289.06 290.22 B: mhm 

289.56 293.09 A: uh and going through pretty much the same l- 

292.98 297.72 A: we can say going through same difficulties or or enjoying the same same things 

297.52 298.34 B: sure 

297.60 311.20 A: that way it's easier um like you said um if you have a regular job and uh your your your wife is is student or a a a medical 

310.93 311.84 B: mhm 

311.26 312.22 A: (( student )) 

312.24 315.89 A: or a doctor otherwise it's it's too different 

316.00 324.72 A: and um the lifestyle is obviously very different i can always uh try and work things out but it's going to be um extremely hard and it's not going to be an easy thing 

324.35 325.48 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

324.88 328.14 A: um i also try and uh 

328.50 330.26 A: and find someone 

330.28 338.67 A: um let's put it not exactly um same religion as i am but something something that somewhere place where we're not going to clash 

338.44 339.55 B: i see 

338.92 347.09 A: uh yeah or be if not if exactly if not if not us per se but maybe our families our friends and this and this and that 

340.23 341.76 B: (( sort of like backgrounds )) 

347.28 358.24 A: some relig- um religions obviously don't get along for whatever reason but we you know i i would rather just avoid this this uh this kind of situation because no one wins that way [sigh] um 

351.03 351.95 B: sure 

358.75 359.45 B: (( mhm )) 

358.98 362.68 A: uh i obviously look for someone definitely um 

362.82 376.49 A: educated and someone someone that's kind of mellow that can work things out things are not going to be always uh great and nice and what have you but someone who's gonna who understands that and will be willing to uh 

369.65 370.43 B: uh-huh 

376.46 378.37 A: you know to uh 

378.38 379.36 A: um 

380.07 383.49 A: (( uh try and work out th- through the rough times you know )) 

381.86 382.69 B: i see 

383.26 386.59 B: yeah you sound like a wise man [laughter] it uh it's like 

384.72 390.00 A: as as [laughter] as opposed to when things are rough you know it's you know 

388.12 389.61 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

389.81 400.89 A: have to go separate ways i mean if if it comes down to it fine but i want i need someone that's gonna that i'm gonna make sure that we have exhausted every every possibility before we could [noise] 

400.28 401.67 B: i understand 

401.08 402.78 A: we could we could do that 

402.49 414.70 B: that sounds that sounds 'cause uh like i can remember when it planning the wedding that's like really stressful so that that that really was like a big test like it's one over you know it was a test of of you know 

414.73 415.46 A: [sigh] 

414.84 420.52 B: 'cause uh things just because the families you know clashing and everything and it's just 

419.04 419.88 A: (( but )) 

420.01 427.34 A: one thing i i will do you date and i think this is a matter of you know style or or maybe a matter of conviction 

424.22 425.04 B: (( mhm )) 

427.29 438.63 A: uh six months wouldn't be enough time for me but i'm not saying that you know it may be enough time for for uh uh um [mn] i think just like you said it's just how you feel about the person 

429.94 430.76 B: i see 

438.51 444.95 B: actually i think it was more like nine months but uh now that i think about it we we met in january we got married in september so 

440.90 441.99 A: okay 

444.22 446.43 A: okay well nine months yeah okay okay 

445.04 448.18 B: so it's still it's still not that long and 

447.09 459.47 A: right but i think it but i think it i don't think it's so much the time that that that that's the deciding factor but rather the experiences you know if you've known someone for two years you haven't done much together you know 

450.22 451.11 B: mhm 

455.49 456.35 B: sure 

458.61 459.97 B: mhm 

459.74 465.57 A: i you could of known someone for only six months and you've gone through quite a bit and that's that's that's usually 

465.80 467.88 A: er by then you've had enough 

468.00 469.03 A: to go with 

468.87 469.90 B: mhm 

469.30 477.12 A: um in in terms of uh marriage and things like that so um so once again the whole uh 

477.00 485.24 A: um time thing is really subject to what you have done together during that time 

483.11 483.88 B: (( sure )) 

484.31 496.71 B: yeah it's funny how they do those you know those like shows like blind date and like who wants to marry like a millionaire like a bachelor or something it's it's kinda funny to watch right i mean like this and and like what do you think those people are looking for 

491.49 492.36 A: uh-huh 

497.19 500.13 B: you know on those on those like blind date shows and stuff 

497.30 498.41 A: what 

500.73 502.39 A: oh blind i'm sorry 

500.75 503.46 B: i mean have you ever seen any any of them 

502.81 504.56 A: ah every now and then 

504.45 505.27 B: yeah 

505.24 506.74 A: and what was the question again 

506.43 511.23 B: uh i don't the question my my question was that it uh just it was more of a comment that it's like 

511.27 516.43 B: um it's really funny to see people on t._v. t- trying to 

514.52 521.36 A: oh oh well i think most of th- most of those people are just there for fun they don't care they're i highly doubt any of them wants to 

518.30 519.13 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

521.54 528.62 A: uh pursue anything seriously from going there just wanna go have fun chill and then i think that's that's exactly what happens usually 

523.99 524.97 B: sure 

528.83 538.07 A: so you rarely see anything materialize out of that out of these kinda shows and so uh but hey as long as they're having fun you know let them you know let them be 

538.26 546.93 A: and um so have you have you talked how important is it um when it comes to kids how important is it to talk about that before marriage 

540.31 541.01 B: (( sure )) 

546.54 559.33 B: um i think it's very important and we did discuss it um at some when we started getting serious and um you know we both kinda had a similar idea wanted you know two or three kids at some point and uh 

550.51 552.26 A: mhm 

559.45 564.57 B: um and yeah we definitely wanted kids like relatively soon and 

563.78 577.63 A: mhm yeah my father teasing me uh like uh five no five's too many [laughter] like i so i just celebrated my birthday and so one of the wishes a few wishes were you know getting married so especially at thirty two everybody's on my back now 

568.37 570.30 B: [laughter] 

577.59 579.31 A: i wish you were uh 

579.41 586.32 A: this and that and five kids and hey hey i ain't training coaching no basketball team right now so [laughter] 

581.87 582.50 B: (( uh-huh )) 

584.48 587.91 B: (( oh really which um like high school or )) 

587.46 588.47 A: pardon 

588.34 589.73 B: high school or 

589.41 590.65 A: what high school 

590.01 592.73 B: i mean one that you're coaching your basketball team

594.90 596.40 A: have five kids 

596.09 598.81 B: i see oh so you could coach i see 

596.84 601.80 A: when i get married i said look i'm not trying to coach basketball team here so 

599.73 601.26 B: oh i see that's funny 

601.31 602.14 B: okay 

601.95 606.69 A: so it's okay uh two maybe three let's see we'll see but uh in due time though 

605.08 605.92 B: (( uh-huh )) 

606.64 611.85 B: yeah this is this is something that like i i mean it's definitely important but um 

611.89 619.43 B: you know and once th- this is something that i think comes after you know i mean in my opinion um 

619.46 627.69 B: we're we're planning to wait you know maybe a year or two more like we'll you know we work out all our differences first before we get kids involved 

624.17 625.38 A: yes yes 

626.66 629.41 A: not only that plus you get a rhythm so to speak 

628.78 629.69 B: (( i'm sorry )) 

629.51 632.79 A: also get a rhythm for marriage so to speak and 

631.25 634.13 B: right right it's it's very different you know when we were d- 

632.98 638.09 A: get used to each other and you know come to terms with the fact that you will be together you know 

634.28 635.17 B: yeah 

635.21 636.18 B: because 

637.97 647.34 B: right see because i mean things are some you know were kind of a little stressful with the first few months as it was right you know what i mean like when so it's it we just you know 

638.27 639.73 A: (( for )) 

642.47 645.40 A: (( oh absolutely absolutely )) 

647.60 651.17 B: [mn] it it's like and and also you don't wanna like 

651.23 652.03 B: put 

652.09 655.65 B: potentially you know children in a situation of where you know 

655.69 663.15 B: you know if things go terribly wrong and we end up you know splitting up you know you don't wanna get the kids in the picture so 

660.71 662.47 A: mhm
