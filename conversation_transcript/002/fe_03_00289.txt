1.24 1.81 A: hello 

1.47 2.21 B: i'm okay 

2.94 4.21 A: hi this is jennifer 

5.86 6.88 A: hi beau how are you 

6.04 8.53 B: yeah i guess so ah so 

7.87 11.44 A: ah so i suppose we're supposed to talk about airport security 

8.95 12.81 B: i don't know do you feel like the increased airport security is 

12.95 14.52 B: made it safer to 

14.64 15.21 B: fly 

21.91 22.74 A: um 

23.90 26.95 A: i don't know the few times in the last year that i've been to the airport 

28.37 29.80 A: they 

29.92 30.68 A: sometimes pick 

30.89 31.53 A: people that 

32.47 33.12 A: i don't know 

33.29 33.71 A: it do- 

34.05 35.47 A: it it's hard to say 

35.59 37.81 A: e- i think that if someone (( determined )) enough they'll 

36.72 37.43 B: yeah 

38.08 40.74 A: and they want to get something on the plane they'll get it on the plane 

42.10 42.90 A: e- but 

43.09 44.16 A: and even with that 

44.41 45.33 A: you know um 

45.01 46.24 B: yeah yeah that's true 

46.46 47.75 B: yeah i mean 

46.49 48.68 A: feel safer in an plane than in a car so 

48.10 48.91 B: i think like 

49.15 50.93 B: (( you )) i sort of feel like um 

52.38 53.15 B: they 

53.25 54.36 B: is probably 

54.82 56.86 B: i mean they probably have made it safer 

57.20 61.21 B: to some extent but i doubt if they'll ever be able to make it a hundred percent 

61.89 64.04 B: or to ensure that people will never be able to 

64.76 65.24 B: um 

66.45 68.28 B: you know sneak something on because 

68.97 69.52 B: it's just 

69.86 70.29 B: [breath] 

70.52 71.42 B: like it seems like 

71.65 72.47 B: whole um 

73.77 81.79 B: terrorism with airplanes you know they they increase security every time something happens like they increase security but then you know 

82.26 89.20 B: there's always some like yeah there's always some or there you know they find some ingenious way to get around the new security 

85.47 85.95 A: mhm 

88.14 89.36 A: they get lax again 

90.08 91.18 B: you know so 

92.19 94.47 B: i mean it seems like there's probably 

94.86 95.52 B: ways that 

95.22 95.62 A: mhm 

95.82 97.32 B: people if they were you know 

97.45 101.59 B: ingenious enough or had resources that they could get around even the 

101.95 104.18 B: more tightened security that we had now so i guess 

104.48 107.53 B: i just sort of feel like you have to accept that sort of risk if you're going to fly that 

107.65 108.88 B: there might you know that its 

109.16 110.91 B: possible it's not very likely but 

114.27 114.71 B: so 

117.78 118.75 B: do you fly very often 

118.00 118.76 A: it's true 

119.86 120.41 A: um 

120.91 122.53 A: [breath] i don't know i mean 

123.28 123.58 B: yeah 

124.78 129.30 A: not e- too often maybe a couple of times a year tops 

129.47 130.12 A: um 

131.69 132.50 A: but ah 

134.52 141.78 A: it's ha- i don't know it's ju- i feel like they're giving us topics that there's just sometimes not a lot to say on 

134.65 135.74 B: [laugh] 

135.87 136.30 B: yeah 

142.23 145.25 A: [breath] but ah i don't know it's just 

145.49 148.11 A: eh only time will tell you know they 

146.07 146.50 B: yeah 

148.55 149.06 A: paid 

149.21 151.51 A: airport workers so little for so long 

149.38 149.83 B: yeah 

151.75 153.20 A: [breath] and expected 

153.31 154.51 A: you know quality 

161.21 161.59 B: yeah 

161.41 167.25 A: expect them to you know be will to give up their life or pay too much attention or whatever 

167.36 169.28 A: ah if you want something done in (( )) 

169.49 170.19 A: sort of 

170.71 173.13 A: professional law enforcement way you've got to 

171.71 172.06 B: yeah 

172.89 173.35 B: [breath] 

173.66 175.58 A: pay for the training and you know 

173.90 177.57 B: ah i wonder if the new transportation and security administration is going to 

176.02 176.93 A: pay the wages 

177.05 179.15 A: to to do it so 

177.98 178.49 B: like 

179.00 182.07 B: help with that you know like having everyone be a federal employee 

184.37 185.19 B: [laugh] 

186.33 187.15 B: (( cold feet )) 

188.62 191.20 A: oh probably not 

189.34 190.06 B: yeah 

190.26 190.61 B: yeah 

190.75 191.94 B: [breath] 

191.50 196.34 A: [breath] just just my little feeling about that 

196.76 199.65 A: um it it just doesn't seem to 

198.14 198.45 B: yeah 

201.51 203.44 A: i don't know i don't think it will do anything 

204.69 205.90 A: that's just me 

206.00 208.82 A: it's i find it ironic that we have it 

207.98 208.68 B: [laugh] 

209.18 216.49 A: since the republicans talk about you know smaller government all the time and they've created this monstrous agency 

210.37 211.49 B: yeah that is kind of funny 

212.28 212.91 B: [laugh] 

216.82 217.15 B: yeah 

217.89 220.83 A: and still haven't addressed the problems that existed 

218.44 218.96 B: yeah 

221.10 221.82 A: prior 

222.23 225.95 A: to nine eleven so like the lack of technology 

226.20 227.76 A: in the f._b._i. or 

227.26 227.59 B: yeah 

228.46 228.90 A: you know the 

229.10 234.58 A: petty politicalness within the c._i._a. of the employees and the fact that 

232.33 232.61 B: right 

233.30 233.94 B: yeah 

234.73 238.32 A: we don't have people to translate documents and 

235.53 235.91 B: yeah 

238.65 239.25 B: wonder 

238.90 241.48 A: all these things you know small things like that 

240.56 242.06 B: yeah i wonder how that the 

241.59 243.59 A: um (( you were )) more concerned about 

242.46 245.17 B: the that whole new homeland security department 

243.96 246.65 A: creating a whole new agency 

245.59 248.04 B: sounds like pretty big ah undertaking 

248.89 249.91 B: i don't know whether 

250.64 254.41 B: it's going to be i wonder how long it's going to take for them to get all of that stuff integrated like they want to 

254.92 255.18 A: well 

255.84 256.33 B: yeah 

260.29 261.42 A: (( probably )) a long time 

261.39 261.71 B: yup 

262.48 266.92 A: doesn't you know they don't have the staff now for inter-agency collaboration 

267.14 267.59 B: yeah 

267.67 270.81 A: this i don't see how it's going to happen for ah 

270.81 271.16 B: yeah 

271.25 272.59 A: the whole new department 

272.40 273.37 B: do you have any ah 

273.64 274.19 B: i was going to 

273.78 274.44 A: so 

274.37 275.61 B: no go ahead 

275.30 276.23 A: who knows 

276.00 281.03 B: i w- i was going to ask um just on the topic of airport security if you had any like ah 

278.11 278.61 A: ah w- 

280.82 281.55 A: no go ahead 

281.82 282.64 B: funny 

283.34 288.34 B: zany experiences or something since you know since with the security since it's been tightened 

288.59 289.16 B: [breath] 

292.73 293.51 B: [laugh] 

293.71 297.18 B: well i don't know because like for example i um 

297.17 298.48 A: i have no idea 

299.29 299.86 B: well 

300.61 304.31 B: i don't know it's not really zany or anything like that it's just um 

300.76 301.22 A: [laugh] 

305.34 306.13 B: i kind of like 

306.87 309.57 B: personally been more 

310.16 314.08 B: uh subjected to like a little bit more stringent 

314.35 314.73 B: [breath] 

314.89 316.78 B: security measures 

317.35 324.22 B: september eleventh yeah i've been searched a couple of times and ah one time i actually was at the san francisco airport and 

322.51 323.74 A: y- you've been searched 

324.35 324.90 B: um 

325.57 326.15 B: i got 

326.69 334.99 B: somehow i got selected for like extra an extra luggage search so i had to take my bag to like an extra x-ray before it went 

335.42 336.32 B: before it got checked 

336.45 336.80 B: [breath] 

337.11 338.71 B: and then when i went through the um 

337.51 337.88 A: uh-huh 

339.75 340.22 B: [lipsmack] 

340.48 342.35 B: the metal detector 

342.22 342.60 A: uh-huh 

342.64 343.93 B: they pulled me aside 

344.07 344.68 B: and i 

345.02 347.38 B: they looked through my bag and um 

347.83 350.88 B: and i had to take off my shoes and this is pretty wild 

351.25 354.35 B: it kind of i mean i guess it's happened to other people but at the time it was kind of 

354.70 355.77 B: seemed kind of crazy to me but 

355.94 357.15 B: i had to take off my shoes 

358.04 359.89 B: and they rubbed like a little 

360.74 361.39 B: kind of a 

362.08 363.64 B: swab of paper 

363.97 364.28 B: [breath] 

364.41 366.09 B: um over my shoes 

366.23 366.79 B: and 

366.93 367.77 B: ah put a 

367.91 372.01 B: like little machine or some kind of spectrometer or something 

372.24 375.22 B: um tried to detect like explosives on my shoes 

375.87 376.14 B: [breath] 

376.27 378.89 B: and ah it was really funny because um 

380.35 380.87 B: they 

380.89 381.44 A: mhm 

381.12 385.70 B: there must have been something wrong with the machine or something when i went through because it kept on 

385.94 388.18 B: it would make like a being sound or something 

388.34 389.81 B: and the person who was doing it like 

389.92 401.19 B: kept on um getting new pieces of paper and rubbing my shoes and apparently she was getting like these false positives or for like explosives or something and 

393.52 393.94 A: mhm 

400.14 400.53 A: [laugh] 

401.50 405.58 B: gosh she like called over her supervisor and he was looking at it and 

405.82 416.78 B: and he's like so do you take any heart medication like if i like so of hard nitroglycerine for my heart or sort of like that and i was like no no i don't take any heart medication 

415.58 416.16 A: [laugh] 

416.99 417.76 B: and ah 

418.71 426.15 B: (( )) they had to like wipe down my whole bag and stuff well i guess eventually they were like satisfied that the machine was just malfunctioning and that i didn't actually 

426.56 428.80 B: had you know nitro on my 

429.11 429.52 B: you know 

430.07 430.83 B: on my stuff 

431.37 431.93 B: but ah 

432.53 434.47 B: it kind of freaked me out a little bit 

439.85 441.98 A: [breath] well tha- that 

442.51 443.08 A: that's 

442.58 443.04 B: yeah 

443.53 445.30 A: i feel better that they do 

445.88 448.45 A: take the time with it instead of rush 

446.27 446.65 B: yeah 

448.54 451.58 A: to try an accommodate people to get them on the plane 

452.27 453.10 A: um 

453.92 456.05 A: i think sometimes they pull (( see )) people as 

456.65 464.82 A: e- it's hard to tell like sometimes i've seen them pull people who i wouldn't think they would ever pull aside, and then other times they've pulled aside a sheik 

459.60 460.25 B: uh-huh 

464.92 465.54 A: on 

468.33 468.97 B: [laugh] 

470.64 471.09 B: uh-huh 

476.87 477.47 B: yeah 

476.96 477.61 A: um 

477.74 479.04 A: then just sort of 

479.60 484.15 A: ah some ignorance in their training on their part the only thing that 

484.36 488.30 A: has ever happened that's made me nervous is um 

488.91 492.96 A: then you're talking of 

490.13 490.50 B: (( )) 

493.31 495.34 A: my husband and i take students abroad on trips 

495.50 496.20 A: every summer 

496.04 496.67 B: oh wow 

496.96 497.76 A: and 

498.03 501.52 A: last summer they removed two people from the plane 

499.08 499.56 B: huh 

500.25 500.76 B: oh man 

507.92 509.02 B: oh yeah 

508.66 513.74 A: it wasn't even getting them off the plane it was finding their luggage below and removing their luggage as well 

510.31 510.79 B: boy 

515.02 515.64 A: so 

515.38 517.02 B: yeah (( )) 

515.86 516.44 A: that was 

516.73 517.62 A: that was like the 

517.72 521.33 A: l- little n- i was waiting for some of the kids to start freaking out 

517.89 522.50 B: did like agents come on the plane and and like the people away with them or something like 

522.10 524.45 A: but they held it together 

528.27 530.04 A: um no they just 

530.65 534.81 A: they- ah like a steward or a captain comes up and says you know 

534.46 535.32 B: oh i see 

535.05 539.71 A: you need to step off the plane we're going to re-route you we can't verify your documentation 

540.71 544.07 A: they were having apparently a problem with their um 

542.37 543.39 B: oh 

545.76 549.32 A: i guess passport screening service or whatever and couldn't 

548.93 549.31 B: huh 

549.53 551.56 A: um verify the the person 

549.85 550.36 B: [breath] 

551.71 552.72 A: says he was (( said )) 

551.76 552.14 B: huh 

552.34 552.92 B: crazy 

553.01 554.61 A: saying he was so 

553.61 554.14 B: yeah 

554.47 558.50 B: was the was the i'm sorry i missed it was the flight returning to the united states or leaving from 

556.51 559.30 A: so that was a little interesting 

559.15 559.47 B: oh 

563.41 564.28 B: oh yeah 

563.44 564.68 A: (( )) departing 

566.03 566.47 B: wild 

566.33 568.91 A: um so it happened at kennedy airport 

567.00 567.38 B: yeah 

568.97 569.33 B: yeah 

571.57 572.12 A: so 

572.80 574.22 A: that was kind of entertaining 

574.59 575.28 A: and that was un- 

575.58 578.90 A: i think we were on american airlines which would make it more nerve-racking 

578.22 578.62 B: uh-huh 

580.16 580.53 B: yeah 

580.26 584.13 A: since there was their planes were primarily targeted 

584.58 585.60 A: at nine eleven 

586.23 586.56 B: yeah 

587.15 589.68 A: but ah no i don't know it's hard to 

589.82 591.50 A: and overall it's hard to say 

592.57 593.10 A: um 

593.49 596.38 A: wh- what will make a difference i mean i think unless we 

596.93 599.26 A: do what el al airlines does 

599.60 600.55 B: uh-huh 

599.82 600.24 A: which 

600.54 601.61 A: by having you know 

601.81 602.27 B: yeah 

602.08 605.13 A: guys with machine guns at the counters and all the way through 

603.71 604.14 B: yeah 

605.98 606.86 A: their area 

607.06 609.11 A: you know that's the only thing that's going to do it 

610.53 612.99 B: they there was a shooting at the el al counter right 

610.55 611.19 A: um 

612.10 615.66 A: and that's how they i think did you hear about what happened down in l._a. 

613.13 613.92 B: yeah right 

616.48 617.71 A: ah this summer 

618.20 618.68 A: yeah 

619.08 621.47 A: right and you know the guy shot 

621.79 625.57 A: or tried to shoot the shooter and because they had their 

623.86 624.23 B: right 

625.91 627.25 A: armed guards there 

626.20 626.47 B: yeah 

627.62 629.31 A: the guy was taken out immediately 

628.19 628.54 B: yeah 

630.07 635.69 A: there was no waiting ar- you know around for some security person to come i i think they just need to 

633.95 634.24 B: yeah 

635.99 636.66 A: to do what 

637.01 639.27 A: a lot of the european airports have been doing and 

638.71 641.88 B: yeah yeah it was kind of freaky when you go there 

639.66 641.93 A: have a military police force for the the 

642.01 644.32 B: and i remember when like when i 

642.74 644.07 A: the transportation system 

644.62 647.32 B: was probably the first time you know that i flew 

647.44 647.88 B: um 

648.24 650.51 B: after september eleventh and and you know it's 

650.72 651.42 B: it is kind of like 

652.93 658.28 B: i don't know it's really intimidating to see someone standing there with like a machine gun you know but ah 

658.39 660.74 B: but i guess you get used to it now like um 

661.35 663.19 B: you know i mean i notice it but it's like 

662.56 663.00 A: mhm 

663.75 664.20 B: i don't know 

665.04 665.79 B: just sort of i guess people 

666.15 666.74 B: you know kind of 

667.31 668.36 B: grow accustomed to 

668.63 670.33 B: ah seeing that kind of thing 

670.43 671.92 B: seems really threatening at first but
