60.59 61.95 B: i am still with my 

62.07 64.31 B: boyfriend but um we're doing the long distance 

64.84 65.21 B: and 

64.86 65.27 A: mhm 

65.61 66.74 B: it's kind of um 

67.64 70.49 B: i guess we've been together for about four and a half years and 

70.71 71.08 B: um 

71.58 73.92 B: we're sort of reaching a point where it's kind of like you know 

74.51 76.30 B: what do we want to do now you know do we want to 

76.88 79.67 B: (( )) going for a long distance thing or 

80.40 80.92 A: yeah 

80.72 81.24 B: (( )) 

83.17 85.31 A: and also 

86.11 91.43 A: uh three of my coworkers marriages are breaking up 

89.32 89.78 B: uh-huh 

91.55 92.15 B: yeah 

92.41 92.70 A: (( )) 

92.80 99.51 A: mainly because of the children issue i think there are there are other issues but um 

99.84 107.63 A: one partner wanting or not wanting children is a huge factor in all three of them so 

106.53 107.42 B: yeah 

107.60 109.70 B: yeah that's an important thing to talk about i 

110.51 111.31 B: before you get 

111.49 114.00 B: married you know but i guess people change their minds sometime- 

114.21 114.51 B: too 

114.63 116.80 A: yeah 

117.42 126.86 A: yeah when i was still dating alexi um i began to suspect during my senior year of college that we might not 

120.83 121.34 B: mhm 

127.00 129.42 A: be meant to li- to spend 

129.57 133.58 A: the rest of our lives with each other because i 

131.51 132.07 B: mhm 

133.84 145.39 A: uh i thought that he wanted a family i mean i thought that for a while although i didn't confirm that until a couple of months ago uh that he wanted children 

142.50 143.02 B: mhm 

144.95 145.42 B: mhm 

145.51 149.79 A: and i don't want children so um i 

147.97 148.48 B: mhm 

149.90 153.57 A: didn't i didn't feel like it would be right 

153.69 155.53 A: for 

155.73 161.77 A: him to marry me un- unless he really decided that he could live without children 

157.54 158.16 B: right 

161.87 162.59 B: right 

163.15 166.30 B: and that's one of those things that i mean even if you did decide that you 

166.72 170.25 B: (( )) to say you know and (( )) place (( )) can't live without children i mean that's something that 

170.82 172.57 B: you know he might change his mind and then 

172.82 174.48 B: you know and then (( )) it's it's just 

172.88 173.44 A: yeah 

174.71 175.63 B: but something like that is 

176.76 177.37 B: p._o._r._t._a._n._t. that 

178.79 182.41 A: yeah one of my coworkers 

182.26 182.78 B: uh-huh 

182.52 191.42 A: told me that um her husband well she's separating from him now but um she 

191.53 202.24 A: kept asking her husband jeff are you ready to have a child now are you ready and he said that he was ready but really he wasn't ready and they have 

196.03 196.88 B: uh-huh 

200.04 200.59 B: uh-huh 

204.62 205.31 B: uh-huh 

215.83 218.13 A: to sow his wild oats 

218.29 218.91 B: mhm 

218.67 220.44 A: like that so 

220.25 220.79 B: hm 

220.53 220.99 A: oh 

221.23 223.00 A: it's kind of sad 

223.27 224.82 B: that is just very sad 

225.12 225.72 A: yeah 

226.79 227.30 B: yeah 

228.72 230.22 B: with with my boyfriend it's 

230.32 230.75 B: (( )) 

231.05 232.09 B: the main issue is 

232.29 232.73 B: um 

233.46 234.79 B: sort of religion as 

234.61 234.96 A: mhm 

235.00 236.66 B: in a way because we um 

236.79 239.73 B: it's actually just very silly because we actually have very similar faith 

240.56 241.00 B: very 

241.16 242.45 B: two different denominations 

242.60 243.12 A: mhm 

242.64 243.08 B: and 

244.36 247.24 B: i mean in general it seems like that wouldn't be a problem but 

247.61 248.01 B: um 

248.14 251.63 B: it comes down to the fact of what would we actually do um 

252.15 253.21 B: like because we 

252.18 253.55 A: are you both christian 

254.00 256.40 B: yes we are both christian i'm catholic 

256.77 257.79 B: and he's methodist 

257.97 258.41 A: ah 

258.78 259.34 B: and 

259.72 260.03 B: it's 

260.32 263.28 B: you know there the differences are very minor but 

263.45 263.86 B: um 

264.00 268.43 B: it gets to a point where it's like what would we do would one of us convert or 

268.78 269.55 B: would we both 

269.72 270.32 B: just be our 

270.56 275.10 B: like our separate like go to church separately and that doesn't seem like what we would want either 

275.73 276.18 B: and 

276.41 278.88 B: so it just seems like that where it's kind of like you know 

279.44 280.23 B: it seems like it would 

280.36 280.83 B: be 

281.44 282.82 B: better to be with someone who is 

283.83 285.67 B: more compatible in that way 

286.12 287.54 A: well it certainly easier 

287.75 288.51 B: yeah 

288.62 289.02 B: yeah 

289.49 291.64 B: especially because you hear so many stories of 

291.74 292.50 B: marriages breaking up 

293.81 295.54 B: you know you al- it's alm- it's almost like you want to re- 

296.05 296.76 B: absolutely 

297.09 298.80 B: (( )) absolutely perfect 

299.21 299.69 A: yeah 

300.21 302.26 B: which of course won't happen but 

304.58 305.32 A: eh 

312.76 313.65 B: uh-huh 

319.63 320.05 B: uh-huh 

323.36 324.11 A: catholics 

324.96 326.61 A: couple centuries ago but 

330.68 331.33 A: methodist 

332.38 333.10 B: yeah 

333.31 334.51 B: there are that's true 

336.35 340.06 B: they have there's just a lot of things that we just you really don't know what's going to happen in the future 

340.86 341.39 A: yeah 

341.03 341.67 B: it's hard to 

343.94 346.85 A: or you don't know what you want to raise your 

347.04 349.11 A: um children as if you had any or 

349.13 358.39 B: well i i would like if i were picking i would want to raise my children as catholic and if he were picking he would want to raise his children as methodist so that is actually that 

358.49 359.67 B: the new issue is the 

360.03 360.79 B: the children 

361.09 361.51 A: hm 

361.56 364.05 B: i i think that there would be some benefit to uh 

365.10 366.25 B: raising them in both 

366.61 367.56 B: really because 

368.18 369.20 B: they are so similar 

369.41 369.81 B: and 

369.52 370.02 A: yeah 

370.10 372.33 B: you know they could get the strength of each one 

372.73 375.83 B: but then you know you run the risk of confusing the child (( )) 

377.06 379.02 B: but that sort of (( )) and then if um 

379.31 379.75 B: you know they 

380.01 381.17 B: if they wonder 

381.76 382.36 B: why 

382.58 382.97 B: they 

383.99 389.49 B: their parents are two different rel- religions they might think well which one is the right one and you know you don't want them to think that and 

390.23 393.74 A: well there's always the possibility that a children 

390.44 390.76 B: so 

393.84 401.69 A: might have whi- just decide as adults that they don't want have want to have anything to do with christianity anyway so 

401.39 402.21 B: exactly 

403.71 405.06 B: and that would be something that we 

403.75 404.24 A: right 

405.47 407.26 B: would not want to have happen if 

407.39 408.73 B: you (( )) i mean (( )) 

408.84 411.28 B: adults and obviously that would be fine and we would accept that but 

411.25 411.69 A: yeah 

412.34 414.65 B: you know we both are very strong christians so i think that (( )) 

416.01 418.72 B: we would not want something like that to happen and feel like we 

421.39 422.08 A: yeah 

423.40 425.15 A: yeah it's 

425.29 426.93 A: yeah this 

427.32 428.53 A: lot uh (( )) 

428.70 432.37 A: going on like that with um 

432.49 436.26 A: (( )) jewish christian meth- marriages too 

436.44 437.15 B: yeah 

438.40 439.33 A: yeah 

438.72 439.35 B: that's uh m- 

440.07 441.36 A: uh wha- were you going to say something 

440.32 440.86 B: that's something 

441.62 444.43 B: oh i was going to say that's something that i think is very interesting because 

444.76 446.02 B: i'm very interested in 

446.18 446.98 B: jewish culture 

447.06 447.44 A: uh-huh 

447.79 450.55 B: and i mean i can't even imagine like i'm catholic and 

450.92 455.85 B: they're a lot of catholics and also we're not very different from other christians and so it's not really that huge of a deal but 

455.78 456.12 A: mhm 

456.35 457.89 B: i mean to be jewish and 

458.71 463.18 B: like if you fell in love with some- someone wasn't jewish i just think that would be such a hard choice to make 

463.29 463.72 B: because 

464.34 465.92 B: there are so many jewish people who 

466.11 467.62 B: you know are not raising their kids 

468.45 468.86 B: as je- 

469.01 470.14 B: you know to be jewish 

470.27 470.80 B: because of 

470.50 471.45 A: yeah 

471.31 475.68 B: you know interfaith marriages but i mean in some ways it's sad because you know the culture is 

476.39 479.54 B: hard to maintain but at the same time obviously we don't want to 

479.97 482.78 B: tell a jewish person that they have to marry another jewish person you know that 

483.02 484.10 B: silly too so 

484.55 487.72 A: yeah a lot of jews are concerned about that 

485.03 486.31 B: it's hard hard issue 

487.63 488.46 B: yeah 

489.53 493.68 A: yeah i dated someone in high school who was jewish um 

494.00 504.70 A: yeah matt um was a well matt had orthodox parents although when he was in high school he um 

504.80 505.31 A: felt 

506.01 509.57 A: constrained by orthodox judaism 

508.79 509.33 B: mhm 

509.68 518.94 A: but when he went to college he embraced it so he's um so he's a practicing orthodox jew now 

513.59 514.15 B: mhm 

518.96 519.68 B: yeah 

519.05 519.76 A: but um 

525.87 532.32 A: although they thought well it's just a high school romance he'll marry someone jewish when 

529.60 530.46 B: right 

535.17 535.88 B: yeah 

535.59 536.08 A: and 

537.72 541.27 A: marry someone jewish and i mean like i understand 

542.98 550.18 A: (( it was )) just a high school relationship i wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life with him but we're still friends and um 

550.44 552.66 A: still we're still fond of each other 

555.01 556.59 B: that's something that i think um 

556.91 557.77 B: is is really 

557.97 563.60 B: it's really good that you guys are are able to still be friends but it works out and everything i've never actually um
