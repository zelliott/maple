15.15 16.18 A: oh yeah 

16.33 18.58 A: no this is the first one [laughter] 

17.89 28.22 B: okay [laughter] it's it was a little befuddling but um it was hard keeping to the to the given topic last time but this should be easier the topic's more interesting 

28.75 34.50 A: it sounds sounds fairly simple life partner that's that's pretty uh pretty straightforward there 

30.76 31.84 B: yeah 

34.70 35.92 B: cut and dried 

35.09 35.99 A: (( oh )) 

36.38 36.99 A: (( hm )) 

37.14 40.91 B: yeah so what do you think is the most important thing 

42.24 43.26 A: (( um )) 

43.31 45.68 A: i think being able to talk to them 

45.66 46.69 B: mhm 

46.47 48.44 A: you know being able to 

48.69 52.94 A: to feel comfortable talking to them about anything and be able to just 

53.48 56.18 A: uh talk about anything and nothing and just 

56.29 59.56 A: be comfortable with them and enjoy talking with them 

59.33 60.91 B: yeah i agree 

59.67 61.60 A: and spending time with them you know 

61.48 62.54 B: yeah 

62.84 66.18 B: so have you have you had that or have do you have it [laughter] 

67.20 70.78 A: ye- ye- not well sort of 

70.65 71.80 B: [laughter] 

70.92 72.07 A: uh 

72.74 77.35 A: i had in high school i had a relationship like that and it was actually three and a half years long 

77.29 78.42 B: wow 

78.30 83.36 A: yeah and the two of us got along great he was my best friend before we started dating 

83.29 84.18 B: uh-huh 

83.64 97.97 A: but so it was like we we got along great we could talk about anything and nothing we'd talk almost every night and saw each other all the time and it was great until we went away to college and we ended up going to different colleges 

89.76 90.78 B: mhm 

93.08 94.33 B: mhm 

97.63 98.68 B: mhm 

98.05 101.03 A: and we just grew apart because 

100.36 101.40 B: (( oh )) 

101.57 105.72 A: it was a it was a distance relationship and in college you go through changes and 

105.36 106.50 B: yeah 

106.25 109.15 A: new friends and different fields and just 

109.27 110.40 B: right 

109.60 113.18 A: grew apart and we're not the same people we were in high school so 

113.02 120.41 B: right i think that's also very important too is to find someone that you can like grow together with you know because i think a lot of 

120.11 121.28 A: mhm 

120.76 126.17 B: relationships or marriages and like you know like the years down the road they could say they've evolved 

126.21 128.35 B: on different paths yeah 

128.37 131.75 A: yeah end up going in different ways what 

130.64 131.80 B: yeah 

131.80 133.79 A: what about you have you had anything like that 

134.08 135.22 B: (( um )) 

135.59 136.30 B: (( uh )) 

137.05 142.98 B: i guess i guess not completely like i don't think i've ever had a relationship where i've been like 

143.38 145.90 B: i've been totally honest with that person 

146.04 147.09 A: mhm 

146.98 149.71 B: and actually i don't know if that's 

150.13 158.60 B: that's if that's actually good if you're like totally honest because a lot of times you feel things um that are sort of 

158.79 164.24 B: transient and if you express them at the moment you're feeling them then it might do more harm than good 

164.43 165.42 A: mhm 

165.61 167.05 B: what do you think [laughter] 

166.34 177.26 A: i could see that i yeah especially like really intense emotions like if you're really angry about something and then you know the next day you sit back and you go oh that wasn't that big a deal i was just in a bad mood 

175.78 178.38 B: yeah right 

177.44 179.68 A: i think i could see that i 

179.50 180.71 B: yeah 

181.02 183.66 B: so i don't know [laughter] 

181.33 182.15 A: (( think it )) 

182.86 187.80 A: would be really hard to always be honest and tell everything 

184.87 186.00 B: what would 

188.11 191.89 A: it's not so much that you're deceptive it's you just don't always 

188.15 189.16 B: yeah 

192.75 194.47 A: say what's on your mind you 

194.59 206.56 B: and plus for me a lot of times i have trouble figuring out what i'm feeling [laughter] for myself so expressing that is like another step behind beyond beyond that so yeah 

194.81 195.60 A: know 

201.07 202.10 A: mhm 

206.71 207.70 A: mhm 

208.34 210.72 A: i think it i think it's hard sometimes i mean 

210.96 214.56 A: it's easy to sit back and think about other people's problems 'cause it's 

214.58 216.74 A: you've gone at a distance from it 

216.44 217.79 B: right yeah mhm 

216.83 221.17 A: when you have to sit and figure out how you feel about something and like 

221.46 223.57 A: it's more complex [laughter] there're 

222.71 225.19 B: (( [laughter] )) 

224.39 229.91 A: lots of feelings and you could go all this this side of it and there's that side and i don't know 

225.63 227.38 B: (( yeah it is )) 

229.63 232.12 B: it's very murky [laughter] 

231.84 232.90 A: mhm 

232.76 233.79 B: yeah 

234.31 234.88 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

235.06 236.88 B: (( so )) 

237.11 241.32 B: i don't know so do you think those two things are enough maybe 

241.44 244.30 B: like being able to talk you know really freely 

244.59 249.03 B: and sort of having the similar goals i guess mm 

249.27 249.81 A: (( i )) 

249.82 252.62 A: don't think that's enough i think that's the most important 

253.16 260.39 A: i think trust is definitely important if you don't trust 'em then it makes it a lot harder to talk to 'em and to feel comfortable around 'em 

255.52 256.54 B: yeah 

259.29 261.47 B: oh yeah definitely 

261.99 265.71 B: how about if you have all that but you're not like physically attracted 

267.68 269.27 A: i think that that can grow 

269.44 270.50 B: you think 

270.90 273.86 A: i think it's to a point i think that 

274.12 276.37 A: if you really care about someone 

276.17 277.33 B: mhm 

276.61 282.88 A: you begin to see the attractive points of them like oh they have beautiful eyes or i love their smile 

282.75 283.85 B: yeah 

283.00 283.90 A: (( or uh )) 

284.67 287.33 A: or you know they have a great voice and it's like 

287.77 290.61 A: even if you're not immediately attracted to them 

290.34 291.37 B: mhm 

290.76 292.78 A: i do know people where it's like 

293.10 294.62 A: a person grows on them 

294.63 297.63 B: [laughter] i guess so i guess if you really 

295.86 298.33 A: you know like mould no [laughter] 

297.66 305.50 B: [laughter] i guess if you if you start to like the person as for their personality more then they become more attractive 

305.54 306.42 B: because 

305.68 306.48 A: yeah 

306.55 317.43 B: i was in this relationship for like i don't know like two and a half years and i wasn't all that i mean he was attractively you know pretty attractive physically but i wasn't personally attracted to him 

317.33 318.21 A: mhm 

317.59 322.95 B: so it was like oh you know it'll just come you know but then it just never did [laughter] and like 

322.42 323.44 A: (( oh really )) 

323.13 330.18 B: and i don't know if that was because i had issues with him as a person or what but yeah 

331.30 333.68 B: (( that was kinda disappointing [laughter] )) 

331.66 333.55 A: (( yeah i )) 

334.18 342.68 A: don't know 'cause i dated a guy for a while that i didn't think was attractive at first but then i started to really think really find him attractive after a while 

342.45 343.41 B: yeah 

343.32 350.16 A: and i've known other people that are like that too like [mn] my best friend is engaged to a guy who when she first saw him she compared him to an ogre 

350.05 353.69 B: (( [laughter] )) 

350.22 355.61 A: and now she thinks [laughter] yeah now she thinks he's just gorgeous you know it's like it's 

354.39 357.62 B: oh that's great [laughter] 

356.81 364.68 A: just one of those things where it's like and and she won't admit so i'd act- she's like i know he he may not be the most attractive peop- guy to some people but 

364.02 364.96 B: uh-huh 

365.17 370.35 A: but she's really attrac- but she personally is really attracted to him now she's he's just grown on her 

368.64 369.45 B: yeah 

370.16 371.82 B: that's great yeah 

371.89 374.51 A: he kind of cleaned himself up a bit too [laughter] 

373.68 375.46 B: oh did he [laughter] that helps 

375.42 378.96 A: yeah always helps [laughter] when they're willing to clean up a bit 

378.85 382.75 B: did you did she tell him what she thought of him initially 

383.58 385.08 A: (( you know i don't know )) 

384.94 386.43 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

386.41 388.50 A: i'm not sure [laughter] 

387.35 390.55 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

389.55 391.76 A: i i think he knows she didn't 

392.45 393.38 B: uh-huh 

392.47 399.77 A: find him all that physically attractive at first i think he does know that i don't know that she's ever told him you know i thought you were an ogre but [laughter] 

396.01 396.95 B: yeah 

398.85 403.43 B: yeah [laughter] that would be one of those things that you keep to yourself [laughter] 

402.48 405.98 A: yeah i don't think that quite came up no [laughter] 

404.93 408.05 B: yeah [laughter] oh 

409.16 417.01 B: so how about the other way around like have you have you known people or have you dated someone that you initially thought was just really attractive and then 

417.23 420.45 B: you know as you got to know them they became not so [laughter] 

421.50 422.64 A: well 

422.69 427.73 A: i i've found a lot of sense that someone that is really attractive tends to know it 

426.15 428.37 B: mhm yeah 

428.27 435.39 A: so right away people that are really attractive often have personalities i'm not particularly interested in 

435.27 435.98 B: (( mm )) 

436.35 437.37 A: uh 

438.02 445.41 A: but the- there have been some guys that i've thought were really attractive and turned out to have nice personalities but usually those are taken [laughter] 

444.59 449.12 B: yeah [laughter] yeah that's tough [laughter] 

445.48 447.37 A: (( like [laughter] )) 

448.26 452.95 A: if they're attractive either they're taken or have really bad personalities or they're gay 

451.34 452.86 B: yeah [laughter] 

453.26 456.34 A: one of them was gay [laughter] 

453.27 459.48 B: or they're gay [laughter] yeah [laughter] [laughter] you didn't know initially [laughter] 

456.66 457.38 A: (( whoops )) 

459.47 460.35 A: (( [laughter] mm-mm )) 

460.23 461.93 B: really did he know 

461.07 463.66 A: well i didn't date him i didn't date him he just 

462.91 464.12 B: oh okay 

463.97 467.98 A: that was just somebody that i knew that was attractive and had a good personality and was like 

467.53 468.48 B: (( oh )) 

468.24 473.25 A: oh i'm gay oh oh okay i i see that that's fine that's cool 

469.88 471.82 B: oh [laughter] 

473.08 474.86 B: (( yeah i've got nice friends [laughter] )) 

473.44 474.34 A: (( [laughter] )) 

474.61 475.33 A: (( [laughter] )) 

477.70 479.11 B: oh [sigh] 

479.56 481.84 B: what else [laughter] 

481.51 482.36 A: (( [laughter] how )) 

483.24 484.55 A: about funny 

484.63 486.28 A: being funny's a big one 

485.76 489.03 B: yeah a similar sense of humor definitely 

488.33 490.94 A: yeah some- somebody who can make you laugh 

490.95 491.93 B: yeah 

492.40 494.63 B: how 'bout similar tastes 

495.05 499.04 B: like aesthetic value [laughter] i think it's really important too 

499.18 502.67 B: [laughter] well maybe not it's not one of the most important things but it helps 

503.49 505.58 A: i don't know well 

504.63 505.45 B: really 

505.61 508.45 A: okay i'm i'm gonna put a a 

508.69 509.70 A: (( what's the word )) 

510.91 512.63 A: a something on that 

512.71 516.81 A: similar taste is good but not necessarily similar opinion 

514.31 515.20 B: uh-huh 

517.12 519.56 B: yeah that's boring [laughter] 

517.23 518.01 A: like 

519.15 525.83 A: yeah see if you're with somebody who likes everything you do and is the same as you that's just dull because you sit there going yeah i i agree i agree 

524.97 531.13 B: yeah [laughter] unless you have a really inflated sense of ego then you're like yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

529.47 530.72 A: [laughter] 

531.31 536.59 A: but if you can get somebody who has a similar taste but a different perspective 

534.42 535.34 B: uh-huh 

536.60 537.74 B: yeah 

537.00 546.24 A: that's great like you see a movie and you watch it and you're like oh my god i love that for this this and that and they're like well i liked it but you know and they turn tell you a completely different side of things 

546.49 551.95 A: you know or you have similar religious views but for completely different reasons you know [laughter] it's just 

546.50 547.42 B: yeah 

550.65 554.22 B: [laughter] yeah that's true 

553.15 555.85 A: that kinda thing i find really interesting 

555.80 557.54 B: i agree yeah 

558.07 560.35 B: that's another thing how 'bout religion 

560.37 561.98 B: do you think that's important i 

562.42 563.65 A: (( um )) 

563.71 566.14 A: yeah i think it depends 

564.97 567.71 B: think if you're religious yeah [laughter] 

567.05 573.55 A: yeah i think in terms of how religious you are because i mean it's one of those with like i'm not overly religious because my parents were 

569.21 570.22 B: yeah 

573.85 576.25 B: oh really okay [laughter] 

574.50 578.66 A: [laughter] it really really turned me off [laughter] on religion 

577.43 578.48 B: oh 

578.51 579.42 B: uh-huh 

579.07 587.19 A: so so at this point i'm sort of like well i prefer a christian because that's how i was raised but i'm not 

585.80 586.82 B: mhm 

587.32 589.90 A: dead set on that and [laughter] 

589.27 594.38 B: how 'bout would you date someone who's really really you know christian really religiously 

594.95 597.43 A: don't think i could i have 

596.02 597.42 B: no okay [laughter] 

597.50 599.83 A: i have a few friends who are that way 

599.91 609.32 A: and they're uh like i have a friend he's attractive he's sweet he's wonderful but he is god boring in nutshell 

606.77 607.72 B: mhm 

608.68 611.25 B: [laughter] 

610.11 612.33 A: would never date him never it 

611.26 612.20 B: really 

612.40 617.17 A: would drive me nuts too much like my father no [laughter] that happened [laughter] 

614.44 616.74 B: oh [laughter] you know 

617.02 621.08 B: [laughter] you end up with people like your mom and your dad [laughter] 

620.33 623.44 A: exactly it's one of those sorts like eh no [laughter] 

622.86 626.37 B: yeah oh well you might change so that'd be nice 

626.49 628.26 A: ah it could be what about you 

628.85 636.70 B: um yeah i'm sort of similar well my parents weren't religious but um like in college i was with a group that were 

636.76 640.80 B: and they just totally turned me off towards people like them so 

636.81 638.08 A: mhm 

641.20 642.57 A: what kinda group 

642.74 646.15 B: um it was it was a whatever christian 

646.52 652.66 B: sort of evangelical they were very into dogma [laughter] yeah 

650.62 651.81 A: (( oh okay i )) 

652.60 658.39 A: was just wondering because i know that a friend of mine tried to get me into um i. v. c. f. 

658.32 661.24 B: oh yeah that was yeah some people were in that too 

661.44 667.79 A: yeah which is a christian fellowship which i tried for about a year and it just nah no [laughter] 

663.38 664.36 B: right 

667.42 669.77 B: (( yeah it was just too i don't know it )) 

670.17 672.35 B: (( wasn't my cuppa tea [laughter] )) 

672.37 674.01 A: yeah not really 

674.25 680.19 B: yeah but one of my um actually closest friends from college she was sort of in that group and then um 

674.67 675.24 A: (( [laughter] )) 

680.15 693.71 B: she started dating this guy who who wasn't christian at all and so that was like a big issue for her but i guess she's not actually th- that religious after all because you know she's still with him after like a year [laughter] yeah 

685.51 686.40 A: mhm 

691.94 692.96 A: (( oh wow )) 

693.55 695.17 A: (( well i think that )) 

695.49 697.30 A: i think sometimes people don't 

697.81 703.90 A: don't realize you know what's going to be important or not they could be because other things more overshadow it 

701.30 702.30 B: yeah 

703.70 704.70 B: right 

703.99 704.74 A: like 

704.79 708.67 A: like one of my friends that got me involved in this in this i. v. group 

708.44 709.23 B: uh-huh 

708.87 716.75 A: extremely religious she was raised in a religious family and the and she was a small group leader for i. v. 

716.51 717.54 B: mhm 

717.31 719.90 A: and she always said one of the most
