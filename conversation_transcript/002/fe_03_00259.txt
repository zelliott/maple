1.06 2.22 A: hello 

2.02 3.28 B: hey who's this 

2.67 4.01 A: uh i'm ben 

3.94 5.35 B: (( hey i'm matt )) 

5.03 6.43 A: mm good to meet you 

6.19 7.34 B: yeah you too 

7.90 11.58 B: so how how did your life change since september eleventh 

11.13 13.86 A: how has it changed um [lipsmack] 

14.01 17.87 A: i don't know uh not in very significant ways 

17.51 20.93 B: yeah what what's your profession anyway 

20.71 22.49 A: i'm a graduate student 

22.47 23.59 B: oh okay 

23.60 24.49 A: you 

23.95 27.27 B: oh i'm an undergrad student actually [noise] 

26.43 28.83 A: oh yeah um 

27.80 31.70 B: yeah i'm down down in california yeah 

30.60 36.89 A: yeah i'm from california that's where i was when uh when it happened but i've moved to the east coast since 

34.72 35.70 B: oh okay 

36.42 37.44 B: oh okay 

37.41 47.65 A: so uh yeah i don't know it's not uh in california it seems i think like significantly less of a threat you know than it uh does on the east coast 

44.00 46.30 B: yeah [laughter] 

47.62 52.21 B: yeah here's it's uh yeah i i'm not too worried about it the the only 

52.38 55.02 B: [mn] reason i worry at all about it is 

55.18 64.05 B: or even think about it was when i fly but my dad's a pilot and so i grew up flying my whole life so flying just seems so normal that you know it doesn't really [laughter] 

63.61 64.78 A: yeah 

64.20 66.42 B: it seemed that big of a deal when [laughter] 

66.36 67.43 A: right 

66.86 67.82 B: even 

68.35 70.45 A: so but now you find it scarier 

70.23 77.68 B: oh no no i i i'm saying that i'm saying that i'll think about it but flying seems normal anyway so i i could see for someone who feels 

77.68 85.89 B: uncomfortable flying anyway that they might see that as something something else added to it but yeah i i don't really think about it much 

80.28 81.67 A: yeah 

86.49 88.04 A: yeah 

86.67 87.58 B: um 

87.78 89.24 B: i i guess only 

90.38 95.08 B: i guess only thing where it's intensified in my life is 

95.28 97.04 B: um it's 

97.42 103.63 B: just got me thinking a little more politically which i think [sigh] i think pretty politically anyway so [laughter] 

103.41 104.35 A: yeah 

104.48 108.66 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

104.74 109.17 A: so what has it made you think politically 

109.17 111.26 B: oh probably 

111.54 112.78 B: um 

114.46 117.24 A: like how has it changed your political views 

116.96 123.31 B: yeah uh it's just it's actually presented more of a dialectic than anything you know bef- um 

123.86 125.23 B: before uh 

128.28 134.40 B: yeah i guess kinda before september eleventh there was just kinda it was just kinda it was it was just kinda 

135.51 137.62 B: um you know the the 

137.70 140.07 B: (( these countries hate america [laughter] you know what i mean )) 

139.88 140.89 A: right 

140.27 141.56 B: and uh 

141.96 152.46 B: and uh these countries hate america and uh you know we fight against 'em things like that and then but it's it's caused me to look into things like you know the the way we 

153.02 163.65 B: support israel and [laughter] and all the implications it has on them you know israel's sitting there with you know a whole lot of military technology and they're they're 

155.38 156.31 A: right 

164.09 168.03 B: and pushing around the palestinians too you know and [laughter] 

167.62 168.96 A: right 

168.34 178.07 B: so it it's caused me i guess to sympathize a little more b- but you know not not agree with the methods [laughter] 

176.95 184.66 A: yeah yeah yeah but maybe to look at sort of some of the root causes of what happened yeah 

181.83 183.67 B: yeah 

183.71 185.21 B: yeah what about you 

185.36 186.44 A: um 

186.76 188.80 A: yeah i don't know it um 

189.41 193.81 A: i guess it hasn't gotten me like involved politically or anything like that um 

193.93 196.42 B: (( yeah )) 

194.58 196.67 A: [mn] but uh yeah it's 

197.50 204.22 A: you know something something that yeah seems like it probably it should have been expected [sigh] you know given uh 

205.16 206.65 A: given the 

206.77 211.50 A: you know way the sentiment about the united states in the arab world you know 

210.97 213.25 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

212.51 213.48 A: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

213.80 215.60 B: yeah 

213.97 217.51 A: yeah terrible trag- tragedy though 

217.86 219.10 A: for sure 

219.23 220.19 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

219.54 227.58 B: [noise] yeah [laughter] the arab the arab world's definitely blackballed in international negotiations and all that too so [laughter] i mean [noise] 

225.98 227.09 A: yeah 

227.72 235.65 A: yeah no it's not uh not a good situation i mean i remember there were there was more discussion i think right after it happened about you know 

236.57 245.42 A: you know why why did this happen um than there is now i think all that sort of discussion went away pretty fast you know but right away there were you know people 

239.33 240.14 B: (( mm )) 

245.58 251.62 A: saying that we really need to look into the united states' uh arab policy 

246.32 250.67 B: (( yeah )) 

251.67 252.96 A: and uh 

254.46 257.63 A: that's not so much on the t._v. anymore [sigh] 

257.12 259.88 B: (( yeah )) 

257.84 265.65 A: but uh so but what you're saying is that you weren't weren't really quite so aware of um what was going on politically 

264.05 268.91 B: [sigh] well i i think i was i think i was aware of it but i i 

269.12 276.43 B: kinda chose to remain a little bit ignorant you know [laughter] not not really look into it it's like oh that's a huge mess you know [laughter] but 

271.92 272.95 A: yeah yeah 

275.72 276.81 A: right 

276.50 277.66 B: but no 

277.70 281.72 A: have you gotten like more politically active 

281.85 283.34 B: (( oh )) 

281.86 283.51 A: since since then or 

284.55 289.79 B: more more in terms of keeping myself informed um i'm i'm 

289.96 291.98 B: actually 

292.80 296.20 B: let's say politically active um 

296.73 303.51 B: i'm a student and i work right now [laughter] so it's kinda hard to get active or not in a lot of areas but um 

298.90 300.10 A: yeah 

303.02 305.27 A: how do you keep yourself informed 

304.97 308.40 B: oh usual usually newspapers uh

482.66 484.15 A: oh well that's great 

486.51 490.41 A: yeah [lipsmack] yeah it's a cool a cool field 

490.28 496.50 B: yeah we had to do a language study this semester for a project and i did ar- armenian uh 

495.79 496.87 A: (( oh wow )) 

496.72 506.73 B: so it wasn't anything h- it wasn't a huge project but it was just you know going through the basic steps of mor- morphology phonology you know minimal pairs and all that [laughter] 

506.53 510.56 A: right yeah yeah that's uh interesting stuff 

507.07 508.42 B: (( hm )) 

510.46 513.88 B: [noise] that's cool yeah so what what 

514.29 516.88 B: what do you wanna do when you get into linguistics 

516.71 519.58 A: well i don't know research i guess i mean 

518.84 520.40 B: (( yeah )) 

520.50 522.70 A: (( [sigh] yes there aren't uh )) 

523.27 527.73 A: there aren't a ton a jobs outside of academia in linguistics you know 

527.85 532.64 B: yeah i i well i probably governmental jobs but 

532.02 533.76 A: yeah 

533.36 534.39 B: um 

534.41 537.01 A: yeah that's true that's a possibility [sigh] 

537.20 539.19 B: yeah actually uh [laughter] 

539.81 550.29 B: yeah but by uh actually i'm a christian and so there's also bible translation for that that's a huge field for linguistics right now so yeah 

547.92 548.92 A: right 

550.05 551.39 A: yeah 

550.31 551.10 B: (( so )) 

551.25 552.83 B: yeah the 

553.95 568.69 B: but how 'bout the other since september eleventh i guess going back to the topic but [laughter] yeah i don't know it's uh no- nothing has see- changed too much i mean you heard all this stuff about how nothing'll ever be the same again [laughter] but 

558.94 559.98 A: yeah 

567.55 568.94 A: (( mhm )) 

569.39 571.60 A: yeah no i think it'll um [sigh] 

572.66 578.74 A: people in some ways made too big a deal about it and and others made a too too small of a deal 

578.43 580.16 B: yeah 

579.91 583.36 A: um [sigh] yeah i dunno i uh 

584.94 591.32 A: [lipsmack] i uh i think it's you know it's it's weird because there are there are posters all over the place that say 

591.49 601.40 A: um you know we will never forget and stuff like that you know which is obvious you know of course [laughter] i'll of course nobody's gonna forget you know one of those major historical events in 

594.77 596.41 B: yeah 

597.68 599.46 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

601.46 604.28 A: you know in america ever um 

603.48 605.12 B: yeah 

604.57 606.03 A: but uh 

606.64 608.45 A: yeah it's uh 

608.88 615.99 A: it it doesn't seem to have changed many people's day to day lives very much which is i don't know i don't know if that's good or bad 

616.30 625.80 B: it's fu- it's funny when you go to the airport because you know the the lines are like twenty are twenty times longer but it doesn't seem like they're doing too much extra [laughter] 

624.90 633.76 A: yeah yeah i actually haven't been slowed down very much at the airports like i'm always a little surprised by how um how lax the security is 

633.89 638.34 A: so i mean i i've only flown three or four times since 

638.62 648.58 A: it happened but uh yeah i don't know i've and i've been a little a little uh anxious you know when like when waiting for the plane to take off and stuff like that you know 

648.50 650.15 B: yeah 

649.14 655.49 A: i don't know i mean [sigh] i know it's probably silly you know because there is such extensive security but uh yeah 

655.96 670.15 B: yeah well and plus all the passenger- i mean no one no one's ever going to be able to take over a plane with a box knife again i mean [laughter] no one will ever be able to take over a plane with a box knife again [laughter] passengers won't take it you know [laughter] 

656.81 658.23 A: (( i'm a little anxious )) 

664.11 665.49 A: what's that 

667.89 669.05 A: yeah 

669.27 671.19 A: yeah yeah 

670.33 670.99 B: (( so )) 

671.91 675.62 A: that only i guess it only probably happened in the first place because uh 

676.33 688.33 A: because people only well just sort of wanted to uh you know try to try to make it through it they didn't realize that you know what was what you know what that it was possible that the plane could be you know used as a weapon or whatever 

686.36 688.23 B: yeah 

688.07 690.50 B: yeah it's true it's never been do- 

690.34 704.38 B: never been done before but one thing i have been noticing is you know it seemed like every week we hear something like oh al al al qaeda's threatening to uh you know saying ka- more attacks are coming and then nothing's happened [laughter] 

691.92 693.42 A: yeah 

704.03 705.38 A: yeah 

704.66 711.31 B: [laughter] i mean i don't know how much of that is due to good c._i._a. investigation and all that but [laughter] 

711.33 715.95 A: yeah no it seems like the public's sort of in the dark about a lot of stuff i mean 

716.70 718.88 A: you know on on uh
