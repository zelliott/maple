15.37 20.05 A: so yeah so what do you think about marriage [sigh] 

19.36 21.32 B: well i 

21.23 25.50 B: i think that their using the term life partner 

25.16 27.25 A: mhm 

25.39 34.92 B: um is really kinda neat because um as you know gays aren't allowed to get married in the united states and and um i think that 

34.76 41.66 B: that um to encourage monogamy and encourage you know stable relationships then 

40.79 41.63 A: (( uh huh )) 

41.69 50.13 B: uh [lipsmack] it would be nice to have more you know civil unions or life partnerships or something like that to 

49.46 54.37 A: uh uh-huh so it's allowed here in united states right 

50.40 51.95 B: (( to to have )) 

54.35 62.67 B: no um between gays and lesbians no only vermont actually has a civil union ceremony 

54.94 55.72 A: no 

56.69 58.30 A: yeah 

62.33 63.38 A: (( oh uh-huh )) 

62.80 66.98 B: um but there um it's not legally recognized in any other state 

66.56 70.09 A: oh i didn't know that actually we are from india 

69.53 70.39 B: uh-huh 

70.16 73.21 A: so yeah in our country it's not [mn] 

73.26 79.08 A: considered to be a good thing but i was thinking like if you're [sigh] legal and 

74.82 76.08 B: right 

78.84 79.97 B: mhm 

79.93 85.92 A: [mn] so what do you feel like is it important to have a opposite sex 

85.99 89.03 A: life partner or just depends like 

89.22 92.31 A: it shou- the partner should be understanding and 

91.58 98.58 B: well i think like the most probably i was trying to think while you know he was he was on there um 

98.78 99.89 B: i think 

99.90 101.88 B: compatibility 

101.56 102.28 A: (( hm )) 

102.92 104.39 B: and 

104.42 108.79 B: and understanding you know allowing for 

106.66 107.75 A: mhm 

108.87 117.97 B: you know not not sweating the small stuff not um getting upset over little things and keeping the bigger picture in mind 

117.24 118.58 A: yeah right 

118.79 125.51 A: so you mainly believe that it doesn't matter whether it's a male or a female like 

124.85 127.25 B: right no not at all 

126.45 131.48 A: (( the facts the sex doesn't count in that )) 

129.53 137.70 B: no right not at all and i know that um [lipsmack] in america it it used to be more common 

135.47 136.32 A: uh-huh 

138.04 139.54 B: (( but my )) 

139.55 144.10 B: one of my aunts and uncles um who are brother and sister 

141.35 142.68 A: (( mhm )) 

143.82 144.83 A: oh 

144.34 154.70 B: still live together and have never married and um and then somebody actually who's my age who's about thirty five um 

153.06 154.02 A: (( mhm )) 

154.77 165.48 B: [lipsmack] lives with her brother and neither one of them are married and you know i don't think that that's really what they mean by life partner but obviously that's something that works for them 

165.08 168.39 A: yeah right so they get along well and 

165.83 167.26 B: and 

167.53 170.23 B: right right and i'm sure they 

168.64 171.36 A: they haven't found each other yeah 

170.63 172.93 B: when they do find somebody i'm sure they'll 

172.88 173.99 A: (( yeah they'll )) 

174.16 176.34 B: (( get married and move out or whatever )) 

174.96 179.78 A: but uh being in a blood relation doesn't come in between like 

180.98 183.26 A: [sigh] i don't know like 

183.83 186.93 A: being a brother or a sister and 

186.11 187.19 B: mhm 

186.99 190.78 A: so don't you don't think it it matters like 

190.87 192.50 A: if you are related 

192.41 202.17 B: well i think that the the concept that you know keeps them together or that makes it work is that they're both that they're compatible with each other 

201.76 202.70 A: uh-huh 

202.29 203.33 B: um 

203.82 205.37 B: (( [lipsmack] that )) 

205.33 210.34 A: so isn't it like more challenging if you have somebody 

210.52 213.55 A: you haven't known since your childhood and 

213.36 218.21 B: right oh definitely definitely now are you married 

214.12 215.13 A: [laughter] 

217.63 220.62 A: yeah i'm married i have two kids 

218.63 219.58 B: uh-huh 

219.98 223.65 B: uh-huh and do you think like what what 

220.65 221.74 A: (( so )) 

223.85 226.00 B: keeps you and your husband together 

226.23 236.17 A: um [sigh] like free uh in india we generally don't have love marriages and it's all arranged by our families and 

231.80 232.68 B: uh-huh 

235.51 236.56 B: right 

236.34 240.83 A: so um [sigh] actually when we get married 

240.58 241.63 B: mhm 

241.57 247.68 A: so that's where the love starts and [sigh] i don't know it's kind of 

247.74 254.04 A: which gets us together and because we don't know each other before marriage 

253.66 254.81 B: mhm 

254.46 258.81 A: so we try to understand each other after marriage and we try to 

257.33 258.70 B: right 

259.15 261.00 A: change accordingly 

260.54 261.88 B: mhm 

261.21 263.75 A: our partners and try to 

264.24 268.42 A: [laughter] adjust and in like our culture it's not just uh 

268.76 273.05 A: two people marrying each other it's the families are also involved 

272.80 275.20 B: mhm mhm so 

273.73 276.29 A: so any decisions like our 

276.63 283.51 A: family believes then everything is so basically it's [sigh] from every side 

278.52 279.82 B: mhm 

283.74 287.56 A: and once you have kids you are bound and more 

287.21 288.41 B: right 

287.89 297.55 A: and divorce and getting separate it's it's not much in our culture so we try to if it's not working out very well 

293.78 294.84 B: mhm 

297.44 298.52 B: mhm 

297.68 298.78 A: we try to 

299.28 301.78 A: try to get it [mn] like 

303.35 304.22 A: [laughter] 

304.29 305.30 A: try to 

305.50 307.53 A: adjust mainly 

307.95 312.29 A: um i should say it's not good it's not fair but 

312.31 318.84 A: i- in our culture mainly ladies have to adjust a little more 

318.24 319.25 B: right 

319.05 322.16 A: and but if she gets 

322.25 323.82 A: (( faithfully hurt like )) 

324.19 325.84 A: honestly she gets her 

326.77 327.69 A: whatever 

328.14 329.23 A: (( doesn't )) 

328.94 330.24 B: mhm 

329.29 335.92 A: share from her husband she is satisfied and she'll give everything what they like and 

330.64 331.89 B: mhm 

335.23 336.23 B: right 

335.95 338.96 A: it's just a little bit of caring 

338.41 339.87 B: mhm 

339.15 340.61 A: and understanding 

340.29 341.39 B: mhm 

340.71 341.62 A: so 

341.83 342.56 A: (( uh )) 

341.89 349.92 B: and it sounds like there's a commitment by the families and by you in in in just entering into 

346.14 347.03 A: yeah 

349.70 350.73 A: yeah that's 

350.08 353.82 B: the arranged marriage that you know that you have to make it work 

353.43 362.97 A: that's true that's true that's also one point to like [sigh] um because we don't have divorces and separations so much because 

362.32 363.40 B: mhm 

363.10 365.47 A: um the families always try to 

365.66 369.43 A: bring us back if we have are having some problems 

366.81 367.91 B: right 

368.76 370.42 B: yeah and i 

369.45 372.66 A: (( so there's a force from our family also )) 

372.20 373.60 B: mhm 

372.89 376.77 A: and because it's a big pain regretting from each other 

374.36 375.36 B: mhm 

376.47 383.10 B: mhm and that that's something that probably isn't as strong in america i don't think we 

376.96 377.87 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

382.06 391.19 A: yeah here i think it's more of goes and like partners uh decision what you are you want to marry or you 

390.63 391.93 B: mhm 

391.28 405.44 A: want to get separated what i have come to know like i have been here for two years now and what i have seen i guess think if the families are not all that involved and uh i think 

396.02 397.20 B: mhm 

403.10 404.27 B: right 

405.66 406.82 A: maybe 

407.29 408.11 A: (( um )) 

408.32 413.36 A: people don't care about that much of their family or i don't know like 

410.38 411.60 B: mhm 

413.58 418.42 A: if if they just think after they are ideal person then they 

418.43 420.57 A: have the full right of their own 

421.17 422.11 B: mhm 

421.63 424.00 A: life [laughter] i don't know it's 

423.01 424.32 B: mhm 

424.10 427.40 A: so may be i have a wrong opinion but 

427.23 440.19 B: no i i agree that i think people when they get married they they're not looking at the long term and they they're not necessarily getting the support from their parents that that you might get in your culture 

439.97 442.41 A: (( mhm so um like um )) 

442.97 450.65 A: [mn] some couples they go on for their whole a whole of their life with one partner so what do you think like works in that 

446.39 447.39 B: mhm 

447.53 448.37 B: mhm 

450.96 457.73 A: relationship than like people get divorced and get married two or three times and 

456.78 458.91 B: (( [sigh] well )) 

458.08 463.10 A: what is the difference well what does that making them stay together for 

462.17 463.73 B: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

463.21 465.20 A: what do you think is there like 

465.28 466.58 A: (( in your culture )) 

466.22 469.25 B: i you know i [lipsmack] 

469.68 475.32 B: can't really go by any of my um relatives because my 

475.36 483.42 B: my grandparents are dead and my mom and dad are together they've been together for forty years 

477.56 478.44 A: uh-huh 

482.89 483.91 A: wow 

483.53 489.30 B: but i wouldn't say that they have a great relationship um 

487.72 488.69 A: no 

489.20 503.62 B: they you know they still are married and they live in the same house and they have dinner together and but they're not i i think as close as as people that you know some couples that you see on t. v. or 

503.29 504.27 A: (( mhm )) 

503.64 504.71 B: um 

504.59 507.90 A: but still they are together for forty years now 

506.37 513.13 B: yeah they're still together and um and maybe for them it's just you know what else is there you know 

513.30 517.64 B: it's too late for us to get divorced it's not worth it to get divorced 

515.52 516.48 A: (( oh )) 

516.98 518.02 A: (( mhm )) 

517.78 518.93 B: um 

519.01 529.69 B: [lipsmack] the people that that i see who are older who enjoy each other have the same interests and have have more in common 

524.51 525.44 A: mhm 

529.62 530.45 A: (( uh-huh )) 

530.04 531.30 B: i think 

530.94 532.79 A: so um what do 

531.82 534.92 B: share the same hobbies or something like that 

534.34 542.69 A: oh i'm sorry i just dropped you [laughter] but like what do you think the separation reasons are here like they don't get along 

536.03 537.10 B: (( no it's okay )) 

543.26 546.40 A: (( because first they are in love with each other l )) 

546.00 547.36 B: mhm 

546.64 557.12 A: they have a good relation and they'll continue for four years five years and as soon as they get married what is like [laughter] why do you think it's just 

550.83 552.00 B: right 

552.95 554.10 B: mhm 

554.97 556.61 B: [laughter] 

558.46 560.12 B: mm i think 

559.72 560.96 A: (( all over )) 

560.47 568.45 B: yeah it's i think again it goes back to that commitment that they that they're not necessarily seeing 

568.54 574.15 B: in the long run what they have to do to make it work they just they look at the immediate 

573.89 574.98 A: (( mhm )) 

574.38 580.28 B: you know they say oh let's get married but they forget that after the weeding then there's the rest of their lives 

579.79 583.26 A: yeah right but like i have seen some lesbian 

583.48 595.01 A: partners are not married but still like they're having a good time and and um having kids together and they're running a family very nicely and as soon as they get married 

584.87 585.92 B: uh-huh 

587.60 588.83 B: (( mhm )) 

589.85 591.39 B: mhm true 

594.42 595.74 B: mhm 

595.05 596.60 A: bang it's gone 

596.05 597.33 B: yeah 

596.71 601.16 A: (( like what just a marriage thing makes it worse or )) 

601.22 606.27 A: i don't [laughter] i don't understand because if you can stay with that person for 

606.32 612.54 A: five six years without getting married and live happily and have kids and everything 

607.74 608.85 B: right 

609.17 610.24 B: right 

611.10 621.82 B: yeah it might be money in that case because i know that that i think money problems and fights o- about money seem to be 

620.62 621.72 A: oh 

621.89 627.01 B: at the root of a lot of um [sigh] you know unhappy people 

626.76 628.02 A: mhm 

627.31 628.87 B: and maybe because 

629.44 630.53 B: the 

630.80 635.23 B: the families that we come from are so small now 

634.87 635.82 A: (( mhm )) 

635.58 647.35 B: you know there's only one or two kids in a family maybe three and they're not used to sharing they're not used to you know giving up things that they want in order to make other people happy 

639.14 640.03 A: mhm 

640.07 641.06 A: mhm 

645.21 646.24 A: (( mhm )) 

646.76 649.79 A: happy yeah right that makes sense 

649.43 650.31 B: so 

649.92 660.40 A: [laughter] because yeah mainly in our culture the girls are being brought up in a way where they are being taught that they have to give 

660.06 661.29 B: right 

660.49 670.34 A: because while they're married they are connected to the boy's family and they have to the th- that is the main family she is bel- she belongs to now 

663.42 665.27 B: mhm mhm 

669.92 670.86 B: right 

670.57 679.25 A: so her parents are like just she can go and visit them and stay there with them for a few days or 

678.55 679.96 B: mhm 

679.30 690.76 A: but mainly it's her husband's family so she is being brought up in way where she is being taught how to adjust and how to take care of the family and 

690.03 691.20 B: mhm 

690.99 693.62 A: so i think that also makes [mn] 

693.69 702.42 A: though it's i won't say that we don't have problems in our family we do have lots of problems in mainly like f- if uh 

695.69 696.51 B: (( [cough] )) 

697.53 698.48 B: (( mhm )) 

699.51 700.55 B: right 

702.38 711.59 A: mother in law and [laughter] daughter in law just staying together they have clashes and they'll just disagree to each other on each and every point and 

704.85 706.03 B: yeah 

706.86 708.09 B: sure 

711.35 712.36 B: (( mhm )) 

711.70 719.95 A: so it does make a difference but there's a commitment as you said that we have to stay together whether they are fighting whether they 

719.07 719.89 B: mhm
