18.63 19.70 A: okay 

20.13 23.84 A: um have you traveled since september eleventh 

23.60 30.27 B: i travel a lot i'm a college student here in in boston ah so i travel back and forth from texas 

27.22 28.33 A: okay 

30.58 32.18 B: quite a bit [sigh] 

31.45 37.79 A: okay um i actually haven't traveled um since september eleventh 

37.48 38.39 B: really 

37.86 43.11 A: but prior to that i traveled a lot and a lot internationally 

43.11 54.02 A: so i'm familiar with how other countries um dealt with security issues and what it was like before september eleventh and the comparison so 

48.22 49.21 B: mhm 

52.11 53.00 B: right 

54.27 60.26 B: um d- have you d- are you not traveling anymore because of september eleventh or that is that just 

58.68 71.55 A: mm no it's just um i've got married got a purp- full time job [laughter] my life has just changed so i'm not yeah when i was in college i traveled a lot more and now 

65.39 66.46 B: i see 

67.51 68.71 B: i understand 

71.43 73.76 A: i've settled down a bit so 

73.15 74.31 B: yeah 

73.94 74.97 A: um 

75.54 79.90 A: let's see do you think it helps since you've traveled since 

80.89 91.09 B: yeah i i think i think it helps quite a bit um it's a bit more intimidating to go through security and i i i bet that's some sort of a deterrent but ah 

91.91 99.12 B: i i don't know i just recently flew home for thanksgiving and um i got to the airport 

99.19 104.05 B: two or three hours early and i got through security just fine in probably less than five minutes 

104.37 106.36 A: do you do do you think 

104.44 107.73 B: so i think it really depends it varies 

107.56 114.04 A: do you think that you could have hidden anything and maybe it wouldn't have been found 

113.75 122.36 B: well u- um actually to tell you the truth i was carrying my backpack and i had a pair of fingernail clippers in my backpack and they didn't find them 

121.91 122.95 A: (( they didn't )) 

122.26 126.06 B: i didn't realise that until it wasn't like i was trying to sneak it on but 

125.93 140.87 B: i didn't realise i had those until i got on the plane and it w- they wouldn't have been difficult to find they're in a little small pocket all by themselves but um yeah i i i- that sort of makes me uncomfortable since they're looking for that kind of thing and they didn't find it 

133.34 134.35 A: yeah 

140.11 144.01 A: and i would think that the metal detector would have set that off that 

143.38 151.32 B: right right i put it through the scanner and everything and they didn't find it so or they didn't decide to take it i don't know 

150.77 157.04 A: it would have [noise] do they give like lists of things that you're not allowed to bring with you in that okay 

156.08 167.47 B: you can find lists some places more like around the check in area when you go to check in your bags and stuff they'll have a list or they used to anyway ah have a list of things that you can bring on the plane 

167.09 168.00 A: and and 

167.29 175.32 B: and ah they they used to ask they haven't they haven't asked me recently ah but they used to ask if you had any of those things to put them in your checked luggage 

175.00 177.81 A: and fingernail clippers were one of those 

177.13 180.91 B: fingernail clippers fingernail files um 

179.72 180.46 A: oh 

181.14 188.20 B: any sort of aerosol can i found ah mostly when i when i traveled to mexico last year um 

188.15 197.37 B: they wouldn't let me bring my hairspray because it's in an aerosol can even if i put in my checked luggage so i don't know it it it tends to vary from airport to airport i think 

190.39 191.17 A: oh 

196.99 202.32 A: yeah well now that you've said mexico how silly of me i forgot i went to mexico in march 

202.15 203.26 B: oh yeah 

202.38 207.45 A: so so i have traveled since september eleventh i forgot about the trip to mexico 

207.30 208.67 B: where did you go 

208.30 215.12 A: um i flew into mexico city so we we flew from o'hare from chicago 

211.52 212.53 B: okay 

215.17 216.32 A: to 

216.58 217.80 A: (( atlanta )) 

218.28 221.36 A: and then from atlanta to mexico city 

218.43 219.40 B: (( uh huh )) 

221.34 226.12 B: yeah i was actually in mexico in march too so that's interesting [laughter] 

223.85 224.75 A: oh 

224.82 227.29 A: yeah and then we went to um 

228.15 240.11 B: okay i was in porto viata pretty much the whole time so that's pretty cool um but yeah coming back it was pretty it was easy getting there but coming back they went through everything 

230.01 231.05 A: okay 

232.54 233.64 A: yeah 

237.78 238.66 A: coming 

239.22 240.01 A: (( yeah )) 

240.02 246.23 A: i um i have a friend who was six months pregnant at the time 

246.02 247.16 B: oh wow 

246.25 253.46 A: and they were doing routine checks and she just happened to be one of the people who she who got checked 

249.48 250.24 B: (( mm )) 

253.17 254.57 B: right 

253.63 256.48 A: and they made me take off my shoes 

256.35 257.40 B: yeah 

256.77 261.40 A: and um i- they had a female security person pad me down 

261.18 262.17 B: mhm 

261.88 273.24 A: and opened all my bags so now that i think about it now that you reminded me of mexico it it was although from like to chi- from chicago to atlanta 

267.11 268.08 B: yeah 

273.43 274.55 B: mhm 

273.58 278.80 A: i i didn't feel that that was any big deal really 

277.76 278.74 B: right 

279.24 294.17 B: a- actually um i'm not sure if if you know this but or if they had it where you were they ah they've set up a security check right before you get on the airplane so even once you get through the original security check gates you could be randomly selected you know 

290.52 291.36 A: yeah 

293.81 294.81 A: yeah 

294.09 297.69 B: and um i got i i got randomly selected um 

297.87 303.49 B: going coming back up here to boston for the rest of the school semester um 

303.32 316.25 B: i got selected in dallas i guess it was and they pulled me aside and they went through all my backpack and they made me take off my shoes and they did the little pat me down thing with the metal detector thing 

315.97 317.56 A: [noise] oh yeah 

316.71 317.97 B: and um 

318.06 329.23 B: it's it it was really interesting and i don't know i'd never been picked to do that before that was the first time i'd ever been pulled aside for that i i've traveled quite a bit i've seen a lot of other people get pulled aside 

326.85 327.76 A: yeah 

329.00 333.28 B: but it's also sort of predictable who they're going to pull out of the line 

333.30 341.25 A: see i wasn't able to predict it i'd i kind of thought that they were doing like every fifth person or 

341.27 343.40 A: a numerical order 

342.99 354.75 B: right well i i'm not saying like they would select certain types of people really but it w- it was more like if they were finishing up with somebody at the table then they were going to pick somebody pretty soon 

346.89 348.13 A: yeah oh 

353.02 353.69 A: (( i mean )) 

354.70 356.43 A: yeah so 

354.92 359.20 B: you know whenever whenever the table was empty the next person had to go 

359.29 360.19 A: yeah 

359.45 363.36 B: so i don't but that's the method i've seen i don't know 

362.96 364.19 A: yeah 

364.85 370.67 B: but i felt i feel pretty comfortable i mean i've always felt pretty comfortable on the planes before um 

369.89 381.53 A: yeah i had never been nervous even going to mexico i really wasn't um the heightened security makes me feel safer and i think what you said about 

374.21 375.20 B: right 

381.49 385.49 A: people just you know maybe not trying something 

385.35 386.59 B: right 

385.78 387.15 A: because it's 

387.59 389.28 A: more difficult now 

389.48 391.10 A: than it was before 

389.62 390.72 B: right 

391.68 392.59 A: um 

392.81 397.43 A: but i don't know i still there's a part of me that thinks if someone 

397.59 401.32 A: wants to do something they'll find a way 

401.17 408.34 B: exactly i i really think that's true and i've i've seen you know how the people get their shoes scanned 

408.29 409.53 A: yeah 

408.94 415.37 B: and they'll scan it and it'll beep and stuff but they'll just assume that the shoe has a metal toe or something 

414.95 416.23 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

416.01 427.75 B: and i i don't know after that shoe bombing thing that doesn't make me too i mean they're scanning the shoe fine but i mean it doesn't make me feel comfortable as to think that they're really finding anything you know 

426.99 428.51 A: yeah 

428.37 433.59 B: but i a- i agree with you i think if somebody really wanted to get something on the plane they probably could 

433.02 437.04 A: yeah and at this point i would think that i- 

437.69 442.88 A: it's if they're going to do something it's not going to do as be as predictable 

442.78 444.12 B: right 

443.10 448.20 A: they're not going to do something similar to what happened on september eleventh 

445.75 446.81 B: mhm 

447.60 448.88 B: i agree 

448.49 453.39 A: and so they're looking for something that people know they're looking for 

453.18 454.36 B: right 

453.85 454.99 A: so 

455.61 456.84 A: i'm i'm 

457.79 466.48 A: i'm not completely uncomfortable because i i just don't feel that the majority of people are going to 

466.68 470.05 A: try to do something and and yet 

468.31 469.38 B: right 

470.78 473.08 A: in the same token i think that 

473.61 477.49 A: yeah if someone wants to get away with something they'll find a way 

477.23 478.59 B: exactly 

478.73 480.01 B: exactly 

480.18 481.16 B: so 

481.51 488.96 B: i don't know i i still fly quite a bit actually probably more just out of circumstance ah since september eleventh 

486.78 488.30 A: yeah 

488.97 492.14 B: flying back and forth to home and what not um 

492.56 507.49 B: and i actually fly out of logan which is you know where it all started but um they've they've been really intense with airport security up here i think it's probably one of the most security intense airports i've been to since september eleventh 

495.25 496.12 A: yeah 

504.46 505.62 A: yeah 

505.65 507.17 A: i'm sure it is 

507.58 517.40 A: well i was in um i was in london back in nineteen i think it was eighty nine after the lockerbee plane 

515.20 516.08 B: mhm 

517.33 518.45 B: oh right 

517.83 520.48 A: after that situation and 

520.54 532.04 A: london the airport was just so secure it was it was scary to me because i was eighteen and they were so intense 

529.46 530.39 B: wow 

532.03 533.09 B: mhm 

532.05 536.58 A: and being cautious and here i am this young american eighteen year old and 

536.56 548.03 A: they were tearing apart my bags and they were taking lenses off my camera and yeah they were being just very um watchful 

542.08 543.54 B: oh my gosh 

548.02 558.90 A: but i i guess that same situation the airport where it originated from that's going to be the place that needs to be the most cautious 

553.34 554.25 B: right 

558.24 564.59 B: yeah exactly i flew to italy this summer and spent some time there and i didn't find any trouble 

564.47 573.37 B: going getting in and out of that airport i think that prob- the rome airport would probably be i'd say it's probably one of the easiest ways to get get away with 

573.04 574.31 A: oh really 

574.50 585.23 B: um sneaking stuff on but um i don't know maybe they had people watching and what not but i- it was probably one of the the easiest ways to get through security i've seen 

585.10 586.11 A: yeah 

585.50 587.90 B: and customs and what not so 

587.54 588.31 A: hm 

588.36 590.57 A: interesting the differences 

589.49 590.40 B: yeah 

590.70 592.15 B: yeah definitely 

592.08 595.27 A: [sigh] well i don't know how long 

595.35 596.60 B: [laughter] 

595.39 597.75 A: did they give a time limit for this 

597.48 599.87 B: well how how's the weather in wisconsin 

599.70 602.76 A: um actually it was forty five degrees today 

602.67 604.76 B: oh really that's really nice 

604.06 618.53 A: it has been almost too nice because christmas is so close and i'm used to snow on christmas time at christmas time so i'm getting a little bit worried that we're not going to have any for christmas how's the weather in boston 

610.27 611.77 B: right definitely 

615.71 617.03 B: yeah 

618.22 626.39 B: we've had quite a bit of snow and rain and sleet and what not today was really nice um actually it got up to about forty eight 

626.09 627.68 A: (( oh yeah )) 

626.41 635.63 B: um but tomorrow it we kind of have a breather as today and tomorrow it's going to get sleety and snowy and rainy and what not so 

635.29 638.01 A: is this is this your first year there 

637.82 642.02 B: actually it's my second so ah but this is really the first 

638.78 639.91 A: your second yeah 

642.22 645.77 B: cold winter we've had i mean last winter was really really mild 

647.27 649.98 A: yeah that's a difference going from texas 

651.64 654.18 B: it's it's been really interesting i really like it 

656.76 658.00 A: (( are you still there )) 

660.37 662.21 A: i think we're getting cut off [noise] 

673.13 681.30 B: (( [noise] )) 

688.52 706.24 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

706.24 706.92 B: (( hello hello ))
