59.64 60.54 B: i don't like that 

61.32 62.07 B: because uh 

62.40 62.95 B: mo- 

62.59 63.86 A: i totally agree mhm 

63.71 65.06 B: yeah because like 

66.63 71.01 B: anyone could be a terrorist no matter what they're religion or ethnic background 

72.06 72.44 B: and it 

72.61 73.28 B: just kind of 

75.07 75.47 B: kind of like 

76.77 78.02 B: racist i think to just 

78.24 79.80 B: and discriminatory to like 

80.36 80.85 B: weed out 

82.68 83.01 B: like 

83.32 84.24 B: arabs and stuff 

86.48 89.43 A: yes yeah i i that is one of my main 

90.20 91.07 A: concerns 

91.35 93.91 A: also and i think that um 

91.57 91.93 B: yeah 

95.12 98.88 A: it also creates an enormous blind spot 

99.65 100.12 A: um 

100.27 103.76 A: if we're really talking about security which i have 

104.12 105.38 A: my doubts about 

105.51 106.27 A: anyway 

106.55 106.88 B: yeah 

107.87 108.39 A: um 

114.53 114.95 B: yeah 

114.82 116.66 A: um probably 

116.92 121.17 A: ya- you know leaves the door open for lots of different people to do lots of 

121.42 123.60 A: weird things if they were so inclined 

124.14 124.62 B: yeah 

126.12 128.82 B: and you know what i i heard somewhere that uh 

129.88 130.90 B: have you ever uh 

131.32 131.66 B: flied 

131.92 132.99 B: flown first class 

134.66 135.74 A: rarely but yes 

135.86 136.33 B: okay 

136.58 137.79 B: do they give you steak knives 

138.54 139.29 B: for your meals 

140.16 141.64 B: cause i heard that they do so 

142.07 142.46 A: hmm 

143.27 143.62 B: so 

144.29 144.74 B: so like 

145.13 145.65 A: mhm 

145.30 145.72 B: that was 

146.11 146.66 B: you wouldn't 

147.17 147.45 B: take 

147.82 150.86 B: (( )) don't even take box cutters or anything on the plane 

151.56 153.69 B: if you if they just give you steak knives 

155.15 156.15 B: so i think that 

156.46 157.10 B: that's kind of 

158.09 158.93 A: strange 

158.85 161.05 B: yeah strange that there there doing all this 

161.34 161.76 B: all this 

162.68 164.97 B: extra checking and stuff for the 

166.73 170.59 B: for airport heightened airport security and they they should be be like 

171.32 172.61 B: using like sorry to 

173.44 176.03 B: plastic knives for the meals or something 

176.54 181.80 A: i guess the wisdom would be that people who fly first class aren't terrorists or something like that 

181.76 182.33 B: yeah 

182.69 183.56 A: which seems blunt 

182.73 183.66 B: even though like 

184.83 186.88 B: you think if you're a terrorist then you'd want to 

187.27 191.26 B: you'd want to fly first class so you could be closer to the cockpit or something 

192.34 194.93 A: good point good point 

193.58 194.20 B: so 

195.29 198.58 B: yeah tha- that i uh i ride greyhound and uh 

199.22 200.42 B: sometimes and uh 

200.77 201.25 B: the first 

201.57 201.98 B: uh 

202.40 203.58 B: row of seats is all 

203.94 204.88 B: now they like 

205.69 207.24 B: it's a law to like leave it 

207.42 208.35 B: the first row of seats 

208.46 210.30 B: to have no passengers in there 

210.65 211.11 A: mhm 

211.21 213.83 B: because of like people who have hijacked the 

214.22 214.85 B: the busses 

215.62 216.85 B: and they've taken the first seat 

216.96 217.22 B: so 

218.04 219.03 B: for that very reason 

220.67 221.07 B: so 

221.66 223.99 A: yeah i um 

224.38 228.37 A: i don't know ya- ya- you know it does seem that if um 

230.51 234.49 A: airports are going to be secure that they need to um 

234.60 239.12 A: they do need to hire people at much higher levels of salary and have much higher levels of 

239.98 240.67 A: training 

240.99 241.31 B: huh 

253.66 254.47 A: you know kind of 

254.58 255.31 A: make 

255.74 256.16 A: sense 

256.28 257.06 A: but um 

257.78 260.09 A: it just seems like uh 

261.23 262.12 A: somebody could 

262.26 266.98 A: um i i heard a report the other day about the the next big terrorism 

267.53 269.28 A: thing is supposed to be 

268.16 268.59 B: funny huh 

269.49 270.53 A: oil tankers 

271.02 271.63 B: oh 

272.18 272.47 B: like 

272.19 273.72 A: and um the way that 

273.85 277.79 A: that people who are supposedly terrorists get hol- get 

277.94 278.66 A: pirate 

278.94 281.95 A: oil tankers is they become a member of the crew 

282.51 283.30 B: oh 

282.92 286.78 A: so that the oil tanker goes out and and um has 

287.54 290.68 A: one or more people on board who are 

291.02 293.46 A: official members of the crew who 

293.91 296.78 A: actually plan to um sabotage 

297.16 297.51 B: oh 

298.09 305.78 A: the tanker so you know it seems like they're so many things that could be done like that that would just tot- totally be missed by security 

299.22 300.20 B: what would be the point of that 

302.71 303.13 B: yeah 

305.98 306.41 B: yeah 

306.92 307.26 B: plane 

307.57 309.28 B: poisoning the water or 

310.17 310.56 B: or 

310.85 311.62 B: i don't know just 

312.32 314.38 A: effecting the food i i mean yeah 

313.63 314.00 B: effec- 

314.34 315.04 B: food yeah 

315.22 315.68 B: or like 

316.62 318.36 B: doing things like anthrax which is 

318.93 319.31 B: yeah 

321.05 321.48 B: i mean 

322.05 322.99 B: airports 

323.09 326.02 B: and and airplanes is only one small way 

327.21 328.30 B: that people could 

328.91 329.54 B: could do 

329.96 330.79 B: and a terrorist 

331.23 332.09 B: uh act 

332.22 332.52 B: so 

334.02 334.66 B: yeah 

334.10 338.11 A: right and now that it's been done it seems like all this security is 

338.47 338.92 B: yeah 

339.22 339.80 A: um 

342.18 350.61 A: i don't know meaningless and we the way that we've been forced to go through airport security for years it was totally meaningless really when it came down to it 

350.99 352.37 A: i don't know it all seems 

352.48 352.94 A: um 

354.77 358.96 A: it all seems real superficial it almost seems to me li- more like a publicity 

357.25 357.68 B: yeah 

359.40 360.94 B: yeah yeah i agree totally 

359.91 360.78 A: the p._r. 

361.91 364.77 A: for people to feel more comfortable but not 

364.26 364.65 B: yeah 

365.41 365.99 B: definitely 

366.23 376.33 A: not that it actually and i i totally agree with you i the incredible racism that has come out of all this national security stuff is just 

377.10 378.15 A: mind boggling 

378.40 379.53 B: yeah yeah 

380.18 381.56 A: really mind boggling 

381.15 383.47 B: i think it's starting to die down though i mean 

384.44 385.90 B: i think people are trying to get like 

386.30 386.92 B: get over 

387.09 387.56 B: the 

387.80 388.11 B: the 

389.30 392.32 B: the the september eleventh stuff and i think that 

394.56 397.40 B: that people are starting to like realize that they're being racist 

398.38 399.10 B: when they're like 

400.12 401.68 B: being suspicious of of 

402.24 404.14 B: arabs and islamic people 

405.10 405.59 A: but there's 

405.70 409.14 A: yeah i just read the other day there's thousands of people in custody 

409.44 409.92 B: oh really 

409.55 415.63 A: we have no way of knowing how many because they're being held completely incommunicado without 

415.25 415.71 B: oh 

416.28 418.72 A: you know i mean i was reading this story of this guy 

419.61 424.11 A: the other day who who's a canadian citizen who happens to be born in pakistan 

424.81 426.10 A: and he made the mistake of 

427.08 427.57 A: flying 

427.68 428.50 A: through the united 

428.60 430.88 A: states on his way home to canada you know he had a 

431.21 431.68 B: oh 

431.34 436.52 A: to change planes or something he's now being held in a saudi arabian jail 

436.98 438.48 B: a saudi arabian jail 

438.85 449.08 A: yes they they deported him to saudi arabia his wife has no idea what the charges against him are you know it the story was so absurd and so horrible 

448.40 448.73 B: wow 

450.75 453.43 A: you know this is something that's happened in the past month or so 

457.42 458.83 A: just seems ridiculous 

459.18 460.45 B: yeah that is ridiculous 

462.28 468.62 A: so it feels like it's insecure i mean at any uh um you know at any time they could like turn around and target 

468.79 469.29 A: me 

469.99 470.39 B: yeah 

470.12 474.61 A: i mean how do we know you know with whatever criteria there using you know i with my uh 

475.32 480.68 A: anti- war button or something maybe i'll be on my way to somewhere and uh they will 

481.32 482.82 A: decide that i'm suspicious 

483.00 484.51 B: yeah yeah definitely 

485.30 487.05 A: somewhere someti- so that i don't know 

487.20 488.03 A: the whole secure 

487.30 488.57 B: i think that a lot of the 

488.73 489.53 B: the stuff that 

490.54 491.78 B: president bush is doing is 

491.95 493.03 B: just superficial 

493.76 494.71 B: i think he's really 

495.56 495.98 B: i mean 

496.38 496.98 B: i think 

498.72 500.14 B: this may sound kind of crazy but 

500.26 500.91 B: i think that 

501.62 503.38 B: that this whole war on terrorism 

504.26 504.67 B: well i 

504.79 505.85 B: i i know that 

506.47 507.87 B: it's not but i mean like 

509.11 510.15 B: it's sort of like 

510.33 512.20 B: he's using it as an excuse to like 

513.07 515.19 B: trade instability in the in the middle east 

516.61 517.41 B: that's what it seems like 

518.48 523.70 A: completely i completely agree and the the gre- the oil greed uh it just 

520.93 521.44 B: oh really 

523.21 524.11 B: yeah 

523.92 524.89 A: is my thought going 

525.51 525.99 B: i mean 

526.39 527.34 B: i think bush 

527.51 528.03 B: feels like 

528.16 528.80 B: since he was 

528.96 529.51 B: he's the 

529.75 530.47 B: the head of a 

530.84 531.84 B: oil company at 

532.12 533.10 B: or something right 

534.46 541.28 A: right uh coincid- you know just uh a brief aside that he has (( )) in oil interest mhm 

535.36 535.69 B: yeah 

536.88 537.27 B: yeah 

537.53 537.89 B: so like 

541.44 541.87 A: mhm 

541.45 542.00 B: yeah 

542.16 542.64 B: and like 

542.92 544.56 B: he feels responsibility to 

545.10 546.85 B: oil prices low or something 

547.13 548.52 B: at any cost or something 

549.52 551.29 B: that's what it seems like to me and 

552.81 553.66 A: ye- yeah uh uh 

552.85 553.41 B: yeah 

554.07 559.67 A: the control um i you know i mean i guess if we're supposed to be talking about airport security 

558.84 559.71 B: oh yeah 

559.77 564.23 A: that's just like a small part of this whole thing which seems to be 

562.95 563.35 B: yeah 

564.49 565.43 A: control 

565.86 566.58 A: um the 

566.81 567.76 A: control 

568.40 573.27 A: you know at the international level to control the sources of oil um 

574.02 579.17 A: i mean you know it's almost uh uh airport security almost seems like a a microcosm of that 

579.36 579.88 A: to me 

580.03 580.35 B: oh 

580.41 580.98 A: um
