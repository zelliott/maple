0.57 3.02 B: hi how are you [laughter] 

2.05 3.52 A: hi 

3.29 4.88 B: [laughter] 

4.39 6.00 A: [laughter] my name's amy 

5.92 7.51 B: my name's kristin 

7.82 9.21 A: hi kristin [laughter] 

8.32 10.57 B: [laughter] nice to meet you 

11.03 21.70 B: so we're gonna talk about holidays [laughter] i was just thinking about holidays because um i heard that that was the topic and 

13.51 15.25 A: yeah [laughter] 

21.72 29.26 B: it's uh i was thinking about how much i always love christmas even though the [laughter] the hype surrounding it 

29.28 39.03 B: in just in terms of shopping is so ridiculous but then as i was waiting this really cheesy holiday music came on and kept repeating [laughter] 

37.19 39.67 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

39.04 44.57 B: so i was just thinking well it's not exactly perfect but [sigh] 

44.50 51.95 A: well i have to say i i've i'm coming to the conclusion i think there should actually be a a law that you can't start celebrating christmas before thanksgiving 

52.11 53.83 B: yeah [laughter] 

52.78 57.43 A: you know because the the cheesy holiday music in the hall in the malls and such 

57.70 63.11 A: wears on you after a while and then when christmas actually runs arou- rolls around you're sick of it 

62.65 64.03 B: that's true 

63.51 64.68 A: [laughter] 

64.04 74.60 B: yeah i've been in school for a couple of years now and um that's actually a really good way to go because you end up being so busy that you don't have time to shop until the last week anyway 

74.34 75.36 A: [laughter] 

74.66 82.19 B: and so i get really sick of the christmas music for like one day and then it's already christmas [laughter] 

79.97 80.88 A: [laughter] 

82.44 87.50 B: so you ha- did you think of any holiday that you would wanna create 

88.67 94.40 A: no like well it's like when they said that i started thinking i'm like jeeze i don't know i kind of i mean i 

89.32 90.50 B: [laughter] 

93.59 96.47 B: (( can yeah that's that's )) 

96.93 100.49 A: i mean and what what we haven't created through our 

100.71 105.62 A: culture hallmark has managed to create for us through uh their greeting card industry so 

105.88 110.68 A: [laughter] yeah we now have grandparents' day and and um 

107.04 108.16 B: true 

110.68 125.03 A: 'cause what is it we did um [lipsmack] i had a friend who did some research around mother's day and discovered that it really was started by the greeting card industry 'cause they wanted they needed they needed a reason to for people to send cards 

120.90 122.75 B: oh i heard that yeah 

125.11 126.16 B: yeah 

125.71 127.24 A: [laughter] 

126.56 133.82 B: well yeah actually in i don't know i actually i i probably have one idea of a holiday to create 

133.65 146.57 B: just to i w- i just had to g- the assignment for school to go to this jewish service just to be a witness basically and um everybody i i had no idea that basically everyone would everyone prays 

140.08 141.01 A: mhm 

146.41 151.64 B: in hebrew together and some of the time everyone was just whispering together 

151.67 165.82 B: and in hebrew and so of course i i couldn't understand anything but it was really powerful just to have a group of people in a room um and and not to have ssilence as well in 

165.80 175.43 B: a- actually if i could create any holiday i would probably create a like a communal like ssilence day of ssilence [laughter] where people would come together and sit 

175.44 179.50 B: and uh not be allowed to say anything [laughter] 

180.34 181.95 A: well that's interesting 

181.52 183.28 B: [laughter] 

183.41 184.38 A: um 

184.14 185.23 B: (( 'cause )) 

185.47 192.09 B: it it might be a really beautiful thing there's not really there aren't really many spaces where people can 

192.64 193.86 B: can just 

193.91 197.52 B: kind of be together without a whole lot of noise and distraction 

197.88 202.22 B: or the need to really say a whole lot [sigh] 

202.93 204.53 A: true and we 

205.18 208.64 A: frequently are uncomfortable with ssilence 

208.79 209.85 B: yeah 

209.87 219.10 B: particularly on the phone 'cause that's like the one medium [laughter] that you have of communicating so it's hard to interpret ssilence i guess 

209.94 210.74 A: that 

213.32 214.55 A: [laughter] 

219.58 230.18 A: true espec- and actually probably it's harder on the phone because you can't see the person to read body language whereas if you're face to face with a person and they're silent you can still get some indication from them 

224.50 225.58 B: uh-huh 

230.57 234.29 A: through body language as to whether they're happy or sad or 

234.36 236.04 A: you know what they're feeling 

234.40 235.74 B: that's true 

236.18 247.30 B: yeah and it's funny to see that people on the phone usually actually do have a lot of body language that's even more pronounced like they're trying to convey something [laughter] 

247.12 250.21 A: [laughter] yes i remember um when my 

251.18 254.44 A: well especially my daughter was younger and you know we put her on the phone 

254.46 264.38 A: she'd go to to talk a- and somebody you know grandma would say oh yeah you know do we did you like school today or whatever and she'd nod her head it's like you have to talk you you they can't see you doing that 

260.32 261.41 B: mhm 

262.24 263.47 B: yeah 

263.55 276.71 B: [laughter] yeah i can remember a time when i was little and my my dad did the same thing i was i was nodding and nodding [laughter] and he was like i don't think you realize that your niece is like [laughter] answering you really [laughter] 

273.62 275.14 A: [laughter] 

277.46 279.02 A: but yeah that's 

279.75 283.32 A: i don't know maybe maybe videophones will take care of that who knows 

280.57 281.33 B: so 

283.26 287.57 B: [laughter] well then what is uh what's your favorite holiday 

283.99 284.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

288.93 290.40 A: probably christmas 

290.71 291.75 B: yeah 

291.31 298.37 A: yeah i guess it is christmas um i just like all the i like decorating and we have lots of family traditions that we 

298.93 302.89 A: you know we do lots of family stuff together and that's i like that so 

303.49 304.41 A: um 

304.09 305.55 B: yeah 

305.40 307.57 A: with it's neat to er 

307.72 310.76 A: growing up you know past traditions from 

310.86 314.72 A: my husband's family and my family we've blended into our family 

315.00 318.64 A: so you know we'll keep passing those on to our kids and that's 

318.76 319.70 A: kind of neat 

319.90 322.30 A: and i love christmas music so 

321.99 323.34 B: yeah 

323.34 332.02 A: though though there's a rule in my house that you can't play it till december first [laughter] [laughter] so 'cause my son would play it all year round if we let him 

326.25 330.15 B: [laughter] that's good [laughter] but 

332.15 334.48 B: [laughter] 

332.71 333.64 A: [laughter] 

335.08 345.91 B: yeah there's a whole industry now of like different kinds of christmas carols and having you know having them played in different ways and different instrumental backgrounds 

346.11 351.42 B: and i actually really love that it it feels it always feels to me that there's 

351.42 365.16 B: th- only the only culture we have is you know comes across [laughter] through christmas music because everybody knows it and and can build upon it and add these creative improvisations or interpretations 

357.36 358.31 A: true 

358.85 359.64 A: yeah 

366.05 379.46 B: and yeah i find it really beautiful and it's it's funny that it that that's the one one medium [laughter] where it's really clear there's some kind of culture that's developed like even in the united states 

379.02 382.17 A: right and it's true it's it's we are i mean as as 

382.19 387.79 A: it's a melting pot country that's another pl- it's it's one place where everything could melt together because 

388.57 390.83 A: everyone can share their christmas carols 

390.55 391.70 B: mhm 

391.14 392.19 A: and it was 

393.25 398.84 A: everyone has the different flavor and it just yeah it blended and then so we sing 

398.96 403.15 A: oh tanenbaum and silent night from you know that are german and 

401.72 402.56 B: [laughter] 

402.88 409.46 B: yeah except [laughter] i heard once on public radio that they were saying that 

409.54 414.49 B: the united states is actually more like a tossed salad [laughter] than a melting pot 

413.09 415.65 A: [laughter] than a melting yeah that's probably true 

415.22 422.84 B: [laughter] because i think it was pretty much tossed together but there isn't a lot of immigration or assimilation not that there should be 

422.80 426.80 A: right you can still take out each individual thing [laughter] 

422.85 424.15 B: but still 

425.30 427.06 B: uh-huh yeah 

427.31 441.03 B: and i i'm singing in this choir this weekend we had a performance and it i mean it was just so obvious that we had one token jewish song and and uh 

441.52 448.72 B: it just it's it's almost like [laughter] just embarrassing that [laughter] 

448.52 452.56 A: well yeah actually my my daughter's christmas concert was tonight and they 

452.61 456.80 A: did a a little program was called december nights december lights 

456.84 457.76 A: where they 

458.82 466.89 A: they had like a theme song of december lights and lights in december and you know aren't they pretty and all that stuff um but that they also that the lights bring us together as 

467.03 470.18 A: friends and family and community 

470.29 471.81 A: and then they what they 

471.97 480.13 A: the program discussed was um hanukkah and um a spanish tradition of the the luminaries and how mary and joseph 

480.46 482.18 A: go you know go from 

482.43 487.49 A: house to i can't remember the name of the feast they go from house to house and they're they're turned away at every door 

487.07 488.26 B: mhm 

487.64 490.94 A: until they get to the house with the luminaries in it and then they're invited in 

490.85 492.39 B: yeah 

491.90 495.41 A: um i think it's los posados that might be it 

496.02 497.80 A: but it was so they had 

498.82 499.97 A: you know two 

500.02 505.73 A: you know jewish and spanish cultures represented but we didn't talk about anything else 

505.77 506.83 B: (( sure )) 

505.93 507.78 A: (( [laughter] it was )) 

506.89 508.79 B: [laughter] yeah 

507.99 512.34 A: like i mean it's it's good but they were precious 

510.71 512.85 B: yeah it's true 

512.99 520.67 B: it's funny to hear different people's reactions to that kind of thing though because i i'm in this class about judaism right now and the teacher 

521.30 531.46 B: just gets really irate about the whole the whole preach preachy universalism like we we all can go together and we all can kind of 

531.71 537.75 B: fit together when and and on the one hand it's really good but i guess she just feels 

537.90 548.47 B: she's only a voice to stand up against just ironing out all the differences that that do actually exist and and that are hard to reconcile 

550.06 550.87 A: hm 

550.56 554.39 B: [lipsmack] mhm like yeah she just sees 

554.52 555.47 B: (( these )) 

555.52 565.52 B: these morals of um like rationalism and equality and and she sees them as as coming from the the protestant religion 

565.50 577.07 B: um which kind of caused a a lot of a lot of people in judaism to get rid of a lot of the traditional practices and rituals 

576.33 577.35 A: mhm 

576.98 587.94 B: just in favor of fitting in with the new with the new ideas and the new the new view view that everybody's equal and and reason can figure out solutions to everything 

588.33 595.17 B: which it's not as though it's not as though that's bad [laughter] to ha- to have those views but 

592.27 593.39 A: right 

595.88 597.96 B: yeah 

597.49 598.25 A: hm 

598.29 599.30 B: [laughter] 

599.82 600.80 B: so 

600.72 603.20 A: that's funny 'cause it actually i find some of the 

603.58 607.82 A: jewish traditions to be the most beautiful 

608.18 610.26 A: um like i mean where i was 

610.36 614.26 A: um someplace and they were we celebrated a seder supper and that's just 

614.16 615.13 B: uh-huh 

614.79 621.84 A: you know it's neat the the prayers they say and the and the you know the ritual lighting of the candle and the they explain 

622.56 626.07 A: the symbolism of of everything that's you know so that just a 

626.31 639.47 A: passing on that things have meaning as opposed to they're just there you know it's not material it's not they're not only material they have a deeper meaning 'cause they you know they symbolize something else that we remember and we value 

629.01 630.12 B: yeah 

639.51 640.38 A: um 

640.64 641.60 A: (( in a )) 

641.82 643.29 A: as a um 

646.32 649.20 A: you know as a as a catholic we don't have 

649.30 655.18 A: we don't have a whole lot of things like that i know there's a crucifix or whatever but it's not the the ritual 

655.38 656.85 A: that goes with it 

656.44 657.79 B: oh that's 

656.95 661.78 A: (( you know c- catholics just go to we only go to church on sunday and that's it [laughter] [mn] )) 

658.04 658.74 B: (( a )) 

660.11 673.55 B: yeah that's [laughter] that's interesting 'cause i had a teacher who i guess he grew up catholic and he had decided not to stick with the with the church but he was always really adamant about the fact that 

673.56 681.01 B: they the church should never have gotten rid of the latin mass because i guess it used to be a really central focus to 

677.51 678.50 A: (( ah )) 

681.14 684.48 B: catholicism where where yeah 

682.87 689.00 A: right where you had to you had to learn you had to learn the responses in latin otherwise you couldn't participate 

688.52 696.87 B: yeah and at the same time i wonder how much of that was really understood as far as the meaning of the words [sigh] um 

695.86 702.01 A: right right well actually i mean the it wasn't because that's why they ultimately changed it [laughter] 

700.39 702.37 B: (( oh right yeah and )) 

702.49 712.06 B: like on the other hand it makes it it seems as though maybe just not understanding was really powerful or could be very powerful 

711.61 716.86 A: because it it's the yeah it's more the it's the ritual of the the ch- you know it's more chanting 

716.84 718.24 B: mhm 

717.39 719.89 A: because you know they were shorter things to m-
