118.25 119.00 B: yeah 

119.24 120.53 B: i'm a grad student 

120.23 125.49 A: oh see i'm going back to grad school and i'm hoping that the dating pool is hum 

123.38 124.44 B: oh you are 

125.58 128.78 A: better in grad school than it is in the working world but 

128.41 130.18 B: it depends what for 

130.04 131.36 A: yeah that's true 

131.02 132.25 B: what are you going to study 

132.20 133.45 A: hum city planning 

133.83 135.85 B: okay possibilities 

135.25 138.33 A: do you think 

135.95 143.01 B: sure that sounds a lot more promising than i'm in psychology so yeah mm 

140.89 141.85 A: oh okay 

142.66 146.37 A: and hum my sister's actually in a psychology 

143.69 144.65 B: hum 

146.55 147.67 A: grad program 

147.51 148.08 B: oh yeah 

147.89 151.36 A: hum but she met her partner in college so 

151.95 155.00 B: see that's something i kind of regret cause like in college there were just 

155.21 156.28 B: you know so like 

156.83 163.61 B: the possibilities are so much more likely for me because of just the selection bias of people who would be doing the same thing 

163.50 164.29 A: right 

164.52 165.60 B: but hum none of those 

165.90 169.85 B: ex-boyfriends panned out obviously 

170.38 171.07 A: hum 

171.88 172.48 A: yeah (( i know that )) 

171.89 172.54 B: yeah 

172.75 175.07 A: the same i had one boyfriend in college and 

176.41 179.55 A: it didn't work and then i dated around and now i'm like sort of in the 

180.53 184.37 A: real world and dating is like a whole different game in the real world 

181.62 182.42 B: yeah 

183.55 186.33 B: it is and it's actually become like 

186.56 190.65 B: it's funny because part of me wants to just resist the whole like you know 

192.02 198.69 B: methods i would not otherwise choose whatever but then it's like becoming common place to do like these services and this and that 

198.66 199.09 A: right 

199.25 201.29 A: yeah i know i've definitely 

201.98 207.14 A: hit the online dating scene which huh and i actually have a friend of mine in new york who met 

203.74 204.43 B: yeah 

204.71 205.38 B: me too 

207.35 211.46 A: is dating someone really seriously like a really great guy who she met online 

211.66 212.38 A: hum 

213.00 220.58 A: through like one of the services and i'm like you know she sort of gives us all hope that it can be done but i think a lot of it has to do with 

221.33 221.97 A: like 

222.25 227.04 A: you're dating pool in whatever city you're in and so in philadelphia i think like 

224.99 226.19 B: yeah 

228.24 229.32 A: i got some slim pickings 

229.79 236.50 B: oh but philly philly's actually i mean love philly and i always feel like it's one of these places where there's a lot of 

229.96 231.26 A: so 

237.07 240.22 B: young people there's good energy there hum i mean i've lived in a 

240.34 243.84 B: number of cities and i wouldn't put philly in one of those sort of 

244.01 245.76 B: really slow like 

245.90 248.72 B: hum i feel too old for everybody i don't know 

248.75 253.63 A: right no i mean i really like philly and i've met like really amazing people they're just all 

254.26 260.39 A: connected or i think the thing is is that philly seems to be like a thirty something town 

255.54 257.88 B: yeah i could see that 

260.06 260.80 B: okay 

260.48 265.88 A: so i'm i'm in my twenties and i have a lot of friends that are in their thirties that are like amazing people but 

266.00 267.14 A: people that are already sort of 

267.25 267.82 A: settled 

267.95 268.70 B: sure 

268.23 269.21 A: on the relationship 

269.33 269.65 A: front 

269.67 271.21 B: sure that makes sense 

269.86 270.29 A: (( so )) 

271.32 271.76 A: hum 

271.86 273.10 A: not necessarily 

273.62 274.28 A: looking 

275.35 275.75 A: date 

275.89 278.97 B: see i guess i'm in my thirties so it feels like 

279.25 283.27 B: i can see like i'm not interested in dating people in their twenties cause it there is really a difference 

284.07 284.56 A: hum 

291.96 299.61 B: like less willing to compromise 

294.30 294.83 A: right 

299.38 301.11 A: yeah i know that's definitely hum 

301.99 302.71 A: (( )) 

304.36 305.10 B: yeah 

305.19 305.79 A: but hum 

306.39 308.25 A: you know grad school gives me hope 

308.56 313.03 A: there huh a there's a high male female ratio in planning so 

308.63 309.53 B: it should 

311.76 314.88 B: there certainly is i have a friend who did it at temple 

314.53 315.05 A: oh yeah 

315.06 317.68 B: and she was telling me i mean she was married but 

317.82 320.97 B: she definitely was i know from her study groups and stuff she was not 

321.54 326.23 B: it wasn't like in psychology where it's like are you kidding everybody's a woman 

327.38 333.07 A: hum it's yeah i i don't know i'm i'm hopeful i guess 

333.60 337.19 A: you know i just am chugging along doing my thing trying not to let it 

338.28 339.02 A: run my life 

339.57 347.62 B: right exactly that's the whole thing i'm not going to put things on hold keep the doors open i hope the robot is taking notes here 

348.42 350.75 A: (( kind of )) hold us accountable for these things 

350.63 354.24 B: i thought i was going to talk to a robot that was my understand- i just 

353.68 356.12 A: that's what i thought too actually i don't 

355.01 357.50 B: it's sort of strange the way they yeah 

357.64 358.29 A: hum 

359.87 363.47 A: yeah i'm not sure and then does the robot come back on or do we just hang up

365.75 370.97 B: officemate was doing it and she i think the robot came on and just like cut off 

368.63 369.21 A: oh okay 

370.74 373.24 A: okay so we just kind of 

371.47 372.11 B: hum

407.90 409.18 A: willfully unemployed 

409.57 411.49 B: oh cause you're focused 

409.66 412.94 A: huh and i'm doing applications and i'm going to travel a bit

456.68 467.05 A: the robot because i'm not working i put down that i was available like any time during the day cause it really depends day to day when i'm available so i was like oh i'll just put them all if i'm home it'll be good 

461.64 465.84 B: oh oh right 

467.17 467.61 A: so 

468.10 472.37 A: hum so yeah they just called like so many times and it seems i actually 

472.65 473.08 A: hum 

473.26 479.53 A: picked up the phone earlier this afternoon and the robot put me on hold and couldn't find someone i guess 

478.11 480.99 B: me too and i thou- me too exactly 

480.46 483.81 A: and i was like well i can't sit on hold cause i had to like make phone calls and stuff

484.12 487.55 A: yeah i was like robot not okay 

485.46 488.42 B: exactly i was like you know 

488.20 489.61 A: (( )) 

488.56 492.66 B: and then i started to be like am i the only person in this study 

491.68 494.25 A: well right and huh my friend forwarded it to me and i 

494.37 494.97 A: (( you know and )) 

495.44 495.76 A: sort of 

496.17 497.51 A: know people at 

497.67 508.04 A: penn or whatever from being in philly and i was like well i know other people are doing this for a fact cause a friend of mine who did it forwarded it to me and she said she's done it twice so i know it has to be working 

505.97 507.34 B: has she gotten her ch- 

507.62 509.32 B: and has she gotten her check and everything 

509.55 511.99 A: hum i don't know if she's gotten her check oh 

511.54 512.16 B: yeah 

512.23 512.90 A: but hum 

513.16 514.82 B: it seems i know people in a 

514.91 521.70 B: like my sister does r- related research and that's why she forwarded it to me and i was like okay i'll support the cause you know i huh 

521.19 525.56 A: yeah no i think it's great and my my sister in the in her psych program is always like 

526.50 530.88 A: talking about all these studies that she's doing you know for all her friends who are doing like more 

531.01 531.70 A: like she's had like 

531.89 535.46 A: forty seven thousand m._r._i.'s because she has a lot of studies that are doing like 

535.05 535.92 B: (( )) 

537.84 539.69 B: well then you make the big bucks 

546.14 548.53 B: you know the robot will give you a buzz 

547.73 548.54 A: hum 

549.19 549.77 A: so 

550.20 551.01 A: yeah you know 

551.33 551.98 A: (( )) 

552.08 553.28 A: the robot and 

553.41 558.62 B: yeah i had a nice little you know i was on hold as well and then i started being like okay robot i have to go 

553.89 554.76 A: (( can't be that bad )) 

559.37 560.20 B: but hum 

560.20 561.92 A: what hum 

562.61 564.17 A: what i don't even know what the study 

564.63 565.14 A: is 

565.05 568.25 B: i think it's just learning how people talk on the phone 

568.50 574.58 B: basically learning voices that's all i understand hum and i'm not sure why these topics are chosen 

575.35 576.62 B: i guess they're just wide enough that 

577.26 579.85 B: potentially we could have something to say about it 

577.64 581.42 A: anyone can talk about hopefully we can talk about it 

581.87 582.50 A: hum 

583.46 585.67 B: so where are you did you grow up 

585.98 588.44 A: i grew up in northern new jersey 

588.39 589.25 B: oh okay 

588.82 591.32 A: and i went to penn undergrad and then stayed in philly 

591.45 594.73 B: oh so this is like supporting your school 

591.78 592.25 A: hum 

594.17 596.32 A: t- uh yeah exactly i'm like oh penn 

596.86 597.41 A: hum 

597.88 598.53 A: so 

598.96 600.79 A: yeah so i didn't go too far 

601.47 605.05 A: from home really hum and what about yourself are you from the new york area 

602.11 602.71 B: mm 

604.65 606.88 B: the midwest actually near chicago 

605.60 606.17 A: oh okay 

606.98 609.83 B: yeah i've just been out here for school and 

609.93 612.53 B: other things and hum 

612.73 614.95 B: and then a lot of my family's moved out west 

615.28 615.81 A: oh okay 

615.83 622.41 B: yeah which is i mean that's huh the other relationship thing too it's like we've i've moved around so much that it's kind of hard to 

623.62 624.20 B: tackle 

624.75 625.98 A: (( rah- right )) 

626.14 626.74 B: yeah 

626.74 638.60 A: well and that's sort of how i feel now i'm sort of like oh it would be nice to meet someone but then it's sort of like no it wouldn't because huh i'm you know leaving philadelphia in the next three months and then i don't know where i'm going to you know then i'm traveling hopefully for a couple months 

639.88 643.43 B: where you might be are you applying for a master's or a doctoral 

643.18 645.24 A: hum i have to apply for a master's first 

645.39 645.90 B: okay 

645.75 647.16 A: because of the way the programs work 

647.26 647.57 A: so 

647.94 648.44 B: right 

648.19 651.30 A: which is good because i actually wasn't sure what i wanted to do 

651.13 651.61 B: u-huh 

651.55 652.75 A: so it was kind of convenient that 

653.20 662.24 A: i decided that i wanted to do city planning not knowing if i you know want to be in academia or do whatever so hum the decision was sort of taken out of my hands because 

662.91 664.86 A: i have to apply for the master's first 

664.97 665.29 A: so 

665.41 666.44 A: that was like one less 

667.04 669.83 A: tortured decision that i had to make 

668.01 671.06 B: yeah yeah exactly 

670.03 672.00 A: hum you're in a p._h._d. program 

671.70 676.65 B: yes yeah i'm in ah doctoral and i did a master's so 

677.32 680.86 B: and eh actually i'm really glad that i went to a master's program first because 

681.01 684.15 B: it really reshaped what i wanted to do 

684.28 685.99 B: could have made the big decision then 

686.03 686.55 A: mm 

686.77 687.31 B: hum 

687.52 690.59 B: it's just our doctoral programs are just so long it's 

689.77 694.94 A: yeah well my sister like some people were asking me when's she slated to graduate and like i think she's on the books 

695.66 698.56 A: for like two thousand five or something but she's been 

698.86 699.74 A: in the program for 

699.88 701.43 A: three years now i mean it's like 

701.66 702.72 B: is she clinical psych 

702.91 709.40 A: she's developmental and then she tacked on american studies so she's actually doing like two master's tracks and then a joint 

704.40 705.37 B: oh 

709.71 710.38 A: (( )) 

709.75 712.34 B: oh interesting american studies and psych 

712.36 716.37 A: yeah she says that she got tired of controlling out for race and class 

717.72 719.94 B: mm right
