15.74 17.81 A: live in new york city 

17.34 20.18 B: [laughter] oh yeah that's pretty far away from here 

19.82 22.75 A: [laughter] 

20.36 27.09 B: [laughter] which means you're probably a lot closer to the uh to the september eleventh that they're talking about than i was 

27.14 35.64 A: uh but i left new york city for washington d._c. in nineteen ninety nine so was um [lipsmack] before the september eleventh 

35.85 39.43 A: but um [mn] you wanted to begin first 

39.07 40.00 B: excuse me 

39.90 42.03 A: i mean do you want to um 

42.41 50.18 A: [lipsmack] talk about the uh the changes that september eleventh has made to your life or do you want to start first or 

49.93 54.95 B: yeah um sure i i i honestly don't know that it's made any 

54.99 61.13 B: changes to my life in terms of you know routine in terms of like what i do 

61.24 62.58 B: uh well 

63.02 64.59 B: okay actually 

64.11 65.25 A: [laughter] 

64.63 70.92 B: i have to step back i have to step back from it for a minute [mn] for me as an individual 

71.12 80.28 B: um separate from society um it hasn't i don't think it's really made that many changes although i must admit i'm probably a little 

80.29 87.46 B: a little more hesitant about plane travel than i used to be um but it has made a bit difference in my work 

87.57 90.80 A: oh how like what do you do 

88.70 90.15 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] uh )) 

90.91 94.12 B: i'm a graduate student um 

94.39 103.40 B: yeah working with natural language processing um and some of the clients that we sup- support are the intelligence agencies 

102.98 106.31 A: right oh so i can imagine arabic 

104.04 105.14 B: [laughter] 

105.49 106.61 B: ye- ye- 

106.56 120.50 B: well actually tha- tha- that topic has come up but but more than anything else wha- what we were being asked to do right now is look at data and process data and come up with things like names of terrorists and stuff like that 

119.33 122.02 A: oh wow wow 

120.88 133.56 B: and try to find connections between you know different different people um and [lipsmack] different gr- you know like terrorist groups and and members of terrorist groups and i mean 

133.48 146.32 B: i i'm i'm not actually you know working on that directly myself but the people around me you know some of them have been involved in in processing documents for that very purpose 

145.98 146.92 A: hm 

146.42 149.34 B: so it it has affected me in that way [laughter] 

149.18 153.25 A: right um i guess i i uh i 

153.38 156.31 A: kind of i agree uh with you 

156.41 162.41 A: that um [lipsmack] uh individually speaking i other than traveling 

162.47 163.56 A: um 

163.67 168.41 A: i there isn't really much change since september eleventh 

168.91 171.12 A: of course um 

171.64 175.44 A: [lipsmack] it has some i mean i guess uh 

175.64 183.20 A: made some changes to my work i'm working for the uh [sigh] uh a government broadcasting agency 

183.10 184.02 B: (( uh-huh yeah mm )) 

183.34 191.31 A: uh so i mean it's i mean it's not really directly change to my work i still pretty much do the same thing because um 

191.51 206.07 A: [lipsmack] yeah it's just i have to still broadcast and write stories about what is going on it's always so assume i originally you might not know i originally came from china so a lot of uh my reports are related with china but um 

206.07 213.21 A: to the agency that i'm working with um has changed a lot like we have established new 

213.32 219.67 A: uh uh like middle eastern radio network which is total new um 

217.92 218.84 B: uh-huh 

219.74 223.96 B: yeah so so you get you get like different sources of news now than you used to 

222.36 232.38 A: exactly so the resources and uh botches kind of you know go to different places now so so in that sense it's different 

227.70 228.51 B: uh-huh 

232.32 233.17 B: uh-huh 

232.49 238.02 A: yeah so kind of similar to your situation i guess [laughter] 

236.07 242.98 B: yeah yeah so sorry it's it's had a more or less direct impact on my work and certainly the amount of work 

242.99 248.55 B: or certainly the amount of government funding available for the kind of work that i do um 

248.81 252.78 B: [lipsmack] but all you know for me as an individual as a person 

252.96 260.87 B: [sigh] uh i think it i think it's had less of an impact however um [laughter] i do have a fifteen year old son 

260.94 274.81 B: uh and i recently heard that they um that the military no let let me back up that high schools have started supplying military with names addresses and like phone numbers of high school students 

275.00 284.60 B: to remind them to like sign up for selective service and you know i hope it doesn't come down to you know service isn't selective any more [laughter] 

284.26 287.30 A: [laughter] wow hm 

288.09 290.94 B: [laughter] i certainly wouldn't wouldn't wanna have to deal with that 

290.59 293.62 A: [laughter] right um [lipsmack] 

293.85 296.16 A: [sigh] most of thinking 

296.17 305.26 A: [sigh] personally um [lipsmack] or it might have changed well recently there have been like lately uh the bush uh 

305.66 309.44 A: administration is talking about um [lipsmack] uh 

310.26 319.75 A: um giving the uh smallpox vaccinations to to the people on to the military to the you know to those selective uh 

314.05 316.61 B: oh right to the the military 

318.18 322.28 B: yeah yeah my husband thinks that's an absolutely ludicrous idea 

322.15 324.22 A: you think um 

323.74 333.62 B: yeah yeah my husband um uh has training as a microbiologist and an immunologist and he says that um 

333.95 338.78 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] i guess the smallpox vaccine has a certain failure rate 

338.34 340.11 A: mhm yeah 

339.56 347.86 B: so [laughter] and it's like you know why would you want to purposefully you know uh weaken your forces now [laughter] 

347.68 354.06 A: [laughter] it's um yesterday i think um the sixty minutes 

354.27 361.83 A: they did a rather long story on this uh about the dangers of having this vaccination 

361.85 370.77 A: versus the the benefits of having it so i i its personal concern for me is that um you know i have a 

365.18 366.06 B: uh-huh 

370.93 374.95 A: almost two year old son he's living now in china 

372.95 373.85 B: (( uh-huh )) 

374.91 375.86 B: ah 

375.04 384.01 A: um but he has eczema an- and the story from sixty minutes says that um for people who with 

384.16 395.13 A: skin conditions is like eczema and there was approximate women shouldn't um get the vaccination at all and i was thinking you know it's kind of i mean kind of uh complicated i mean i 

394.90 404.46 A: was thinking about a post september eleventh environment uh do you have you know do you have more worries and concerns about what might happen 

399.52 400.37 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

404.55 410.35 A: uh you know uh to me to the people and to my family members 

411.46 413.93 B: uh now um were you 

414.23 421.29 B: now living living in d._c. you you obviously must be you know in the environment of like the pentagon or uh-huh 

420.85 432.86 A: exactly you know uh absolutely we the place i live in is pretty close to both the pentagon and to capitol hill it's like kind of in between uh 

432.94 438.48 A: you know so my husband who who commutes like every week 

438.94 448.94 A: he's uh working at uh university of pennsylvania in philadelphia so he comes here to d._c. to visit me every weekend and 

449.40 461.36 A: immediately after sept- september eleventh he always had this [lipsmack] you know fear i i wouldn't say probably it's not even a fear it's like um [lipsmack] um 

461.53 466.13 A: kind of it's not a sen- i don't know how you would call it it's like he 

464.41 468.49 B: yeah yeah it's it's it's it's something something something 

467.10 469.53 A: what kind of outlook imagination 

468.68 476.08 B: something important and worrisome but maybe slightly less bothersome than what you would really call a fear 

476.20 486.91 A: um he like he would- he like in his mind there would you know there would appear inside a kind of scenario that uh the washington d._c. area has been 

476.46 477.39 B: just some 

486.84 494.35 A: uh attacked either by nuclear weapons or by biological or chemical weapons so he kind you know he 

494.53 502.91 A: had that kind of um real kind of uh imaginative picture you know it's like 

500.55 502.14 B: uh-huh yeah 

502.97 512.83 A: uh for a moment we were talking about oh maybe i really shouldn't work in the washington d._c. area lived here you know it's just too close and you never know um 

512.61 521.26 B: mhm now do um did the closing of the washington airport did that make it hard for you to to travel i mean 

521.10 522.15 A: uh 

521.40 525.98 B: i don't i don't know if a broadcast journalist travels in the work that they do [laughter] 

525.47 535.09 A: we we do travel um but last time i had to travel to new york city to cover something and i chose um 

535.21 537.84 A: amtrak i i even though 

537.90 542.92 A: amtrak is much more expensive than you know going by plane 

540.00 540.95 B: uh-huh 

541.56 543.28 B: and it takes a lot longer [laughter] yeah 

543.38 553.98 A: yeah but yeah a lot longer but but i just feel more comfortable um with the uh but you know then the area regan national airport 

553.86 558.78 A: was closed for a while but then reopened uh 

558.20 559.07 B: uh-huh 

558.79 570.23 A: yeah so i guess i mean at that time i'm sure it has affected a lot of people with with regard to the schedules and their you know but but um i think now it's not a problem 

570.54 577.51 B: have they have they changed any of the like entrance procedures of the building you work in yeah 

577.17 581.02 A: oh sure yeah now we have um 

581.14 585.73 A: i guess all the government agencies have uh this kind of um 

586.16 587.99 A: [lipsmack] screening xray 

588.11 597.47 A: the metal detectors you know that we're definitely definitely seeing more um security people in in and around the building 

597.51 606.56 A: and and since our office building is just like one block away from the capitol hill and uh we can see from those 

607.22 619.29 A: the crossroads near the congressional buildings there i think it's permanent but that you have a police car and some policemen stationed there like all day long 

615.40 616.35 B: mhm 

617.67 618.79 B: yeah 

619.18 625.89 A: i don't know about night but uh so the security has definitely uh heightened 

622.31 623.14 B: yeah 

624.29 631.43 B: well that's that's definitely an effect on your daily life even though you may not [laughter] may not think of it in that light [laughter] 

628.57 629.69 A: um 

630.04 640.18 A: right wow exactly and yeah you can say that maybe it's it's a change um but uh on the other side on the other hand uh doesn't really um 

640.50 648.95 A: affect my routine because i still like i i would still go to the places and uh i could see those people there 

646.98 648.88 B: yeah just might take a little longer 

649.00 651.92 A: uh no it doesn't uh really 

651.00 652.72 B: (( it doesn't take longer mhm mm mhm mhm )) 

652.07 663.34 A: no they just they're just stationed there like ah stay at a corner uh i guess some roads are are closed because of that but it doesn't affect directly affect me 

663.66 666.18 A: like it's not um you know um 

666.80 668.79 A: [lipsmack] um on my way of 

668.95 670.85 A: to to somewhere i guess 

671.19 679.51 A: it's not like the uh thoroughfare like the really uh heavily tra- traveled uh roads but some 

679.79 683.29 A: you know back roads or you know places like that so 

683.48 686.54 A: yeah i mean it it is a change uh 

687.02 690.13 A: uh but not much of a of you know 

691.48 692.81 A: (( um effect )) 

692.99 694.46 A: (( on my daily life )) 

694.39 695.45 B: yeah 

695.00 695.68 A: (( so ))

699.44 701.56 B: [laughter] um 

700.14 700.93 A: [laughter] 

701.69 708.33 B: new york city is not typically a place that i would travel to [laughter] um uh well it it's funny 'cause i 

705.13 706.45 A: why not 

708.18 717.41 B: uh the the very or not not the first time but one of the few times that i've ever been to new new york city was in two thousand one in 

717.55 719.90 B: like april something like that right around passover
