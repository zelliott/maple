24.88 26.17 A: (( [laughter] )) 

26.43 27.72 A: [laughter] 

28.32 33.23 B: but all right so what do you think is the most important thing to look for

72.71 74.31 A: yeah right 

74.45 77.53 A: that's that's the key 'cause if you'd al- care 

77.66 81.17 A: tell them when you're angry or sad or scared 

81.19 86.57 A: um then all of those feelings stay bottled up inside and that's when

112.24 114.74 A: [lipsmack] and i have to say i thought that too 

115.10 116.34 B: mhm 

115.36 120.24 A: at when i was your age exactly i had decided that pretty much i 

120.50 122.90 A: certainly didn't um 

123.44 131.60 A: 'cause lots of prob- friends which i don't know if you if the two of you know that it's like you get in your upper years of college and you're supposed to have have found you know the man of dreams 

131.41 132.84 B: (( i know )) 

131.65 135.50 A: um [laughter] and i hadn't at that point and um 

135.73 144.56 A: so if you don't i don't need to i need to just be me and find out what i want and where i'm going and um and then about six months later i met my future husband so uh 

139.80 141.17 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

144.86 146.92 A: you know you never know what life throws you 

145.50 149.77 B: this how long how long were you together before you decided to get married 

149.39 152.67 A: um actually about eight months 

152.11 153.51 B: wow 

153.37 159.93 A: yeah and it was just and we were both young but we it was it was right and it has been right for fifteen years now 

159.63 161.19 B: wow 

161.41 162.35 A: so 

161.82 163.41 B: that's nice 

162.62 163.92 A: [laughter] 

163.96 165.26 B: [laughter] 

164.28 167.30 A: (( it worked [laughter] )) 

165.34 167.35 B: yeah apparently 

167.86 169.62 B: apparently i just 

168.37 171.97 A: but it wasn't i wasn't lookin' and maybe that's why 

170.69 171.73 B: mhm 

172.16 175.46 A: we found each other 'cause neither one of us was 

175.21 179.39 B: i don't think you ca- it's not like something you're gonna go out shopping for you know 

178.70 180.41 A: yeah 

179.86 180.89 B: (( like )) 

181.34 182.73 B: you just kinda 

182.16 186.40 A: but i think that's how some people approach it you know [laughter] 

184.41 185.36 B: (( yeah )) 

185.66 190.91 B: well like i said i mean i know my cousin just got married and they they're very very religious 

191.17 192.69 B: [lipsmack] so um 

193.73 197.14 B: he any every but my mother because he's 

197.38 207.44 B: on my mother's side of the family he's the oldest grandchild and i'm second so everyone was asking my mother oh so you're daughter's next when's she getting married when's she getting married 

204.41 206.50 A: (( so you're next [laughter] )) 

207.36 208.18 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

207.96 209.23 B: (( and um )) 

210.01 213.23 B: god forbid they found out my boyfriend was only half jewish 

212.57 214.30 A: [laughter] 

215.77 222.08 B: [sigh] um and you know i guess that'd be important too um if i get married any time soon he'd have to be jewish 

223.67 226.29 A: in well and that's something that you have to know 

226.31 227.54 B: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

226.97 227.90 A: um 

229.34 235.34 B: yeah if i were to marry a non jew i wouldn't be able to do it while my grandparents were alive 

236.91 241.11 A: what if what if they were willing to to still follow your religion 

241.91 244.62 B: if he converted for me 

245.44 252.45 B: it might be okay my parents would be okay with it as long as their grandchildren were raised jewish exclusively like they couldn't 

249.89 250.97 A: mhm 

252.98 259.72 B: i know i know a lot of people who were brought up in mixed marriages who you know they celebrate both and that would not be okay 

260.81 261.74 B: um 

262.56 264.77 A: because i i have a girlfriend who's 

265.23 269.06 A: her husband is jewish and she was catholic 

266.69 267.63 B: mhm 

269.23 270.13 A: um 

270.45 271.48 A: but they 

271.78 273.87 A: and they kinda they kinda do the both thing 

273.84 275.10 B: yeah 

274.22 276.46 A: and um but my cousin 

276.82 279.49 A: married a jewish girl and converted 

279.74 280.81 B: really 

280.57 281.52 A: um 

282.20 290.26 A: that you know 'cause that's what and that's actually what it wasn't it wasn't because she asked him to or she wanted him to but it was some- you know he 

290.54 296.05 A: in going to church with her and he decided that he preferred that 

295.15 296.26 B: really 

296.42 304.20 B: i actually i mean that's how my boyfriend's family is his mother isn't jewish so technically like judaism is half found through the mother 

303.52 304.95 A: mhm right 

304.67 312.64 B: but um i mean he was raised going to synagogue he had a bar mitzvah they celebrate christmas too but i mean he considers himself 

312.83 314.43 B: to be a jew 

315.35 316.61 B: but um 

316.63 322.24 B: [lipsmack] i we have a one of my mother's closest friends who actually had a barmitzva with her 

321.88 322.73 A: mhm 

322.41 328.95 B: because my mother like i said our families are religious they don't believe in that um like having a bar mitzvah for a girl 

328.88 329.59 A: (( oh )) 

329.75 333.36 B: so um [lipsmack] she had her bar mitzvah when i was like 

333.64 335.47 B: twelve years old 

335.92 344.01 B: and one of the women she had her bar mitzvah with there was like a group of older women at the shoal not older but like you know grown women at the shoal who did it together 

341.25 342.65 A: mhm 

343.98 352.69 B: and one of them was a woman who had converted when she got married and they had three daughters and she's divorced now 

352.99 358.69 B: and she still i mean is very active in the synagogue she you know had her bar mitzvah 

359.91 365.44 B: so i i mean she i guess converted because she really believed not like just 

363.51 364.50 A: mhm 

365.43 369.60 A: be- because it was the i don't know nice thing to do [laughter] [laughter] 

367.02 368.01 B: right 

368.96 370.18 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

370.27 371.98 B: (( but um )) 

373.09 375.22 B: i mean normally my parents 

376.12 379.20 B: want their grandchildren to be jewish and 

380.03 381.29 B: i would want 

382.28 383.31 B: i mean 

384.65 389.96 B: i i've grown up always celebrating the holidays it's important to me i'd want my husband to 

389.80 391.10 A: mhm 

390.59 392.12 B: (( be part of that [lipsmack] )) 

394.28 395.13 B: (( so )) 

394.94 400.87 A: and well i think and that's when you're finding a partner that's what you have to be willing to do is to keep 

400.89 401.91 B: i know 

401.86 409.13 A: you know do things that make the other one happy and not just because you're making them happy because by making them happy you're happy too 

409.33 410.36 B: mhm 

409.77 411.19 A: [laughter] 

411.13 412.70 B: yeah 

411.21 412.99 A: you know we have 

413.45 415.08 A: in our you know 

415.90 417.67 A: you have you know what 

417.70 428.66 A: my family did for christmas and the holidays and whatever and what his family did for christmas and the holidays and all that stuff and now what we do with our our own family is a mix of the two and some of our own stuff 

428.80 430.49 B: [mn] that's nice 

429.45 432.58 A: you know that that we found a blend because we're not 

431.52 432.78 B: mhm 

432.61 434.27 A: either one of our parents 

434.09 435.32 B: right
