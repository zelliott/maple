56.10 60.69 B: am much more relaxed about uh catching airplanes uh because 

61.89 67.51 B: uh in order to avoid missing them you have to get to the airport very early because you never know exactly what's going on

96.05 97.38 A: (( )) in my life 

98.11 103.25 B: i guess i've also become a lot uh a lot more militant myself in terms of um 

100.79 101.29 A: (( )) 

102.76 103.11 A: work 

104.54 105.00 B: in terms

128.75 129.34 B: um 

130.33 131.00 B: about 

131.17 135.70 B: you know i i guess i've become less tolerant in my mind uh of

137.89 138.30 A: mhm 

140.67 147.12 B: although it seems pretty extreme what we've seen in the papers lately about the uh 

147.83 148.09 B: threat 

148.19 149.11 B: of uh 

149.33 154.07 B: preemptive strikes and uh n- nuclear retaliation my my thought is 

154.20 154.52 B: hey 

155.32 156.18 B: uh 

156.58 161.70 B: it's a jungle out there and whoever survives wins and so you know i'm all into survival 

162.53 163.07 A: so am i 

164.38 168.19 A: yeah i remember the day it happened i was actually at the college and uh 

168.55 168.87 A: they 

168.97 171.75 A: they as soon as it happened they cancelled all classes because 

171.97 179.30 A: being in philadelphia they were afraid that okay they hit the pentagon they had hit the tra- worl- uh twin towers they thought okay the might hit philadelphia so 

179.58 180.01 B: yup 

179.70 181.11 A: everything closed down in the city 

181.84 182.19 B: yeah 

181.90 184.63 A: and uh it was like that for i guess the next day 

185.21 186.97 A: and it was probably 

187.16 189.47 A: friday or following monday before everything kind of 

190.50 192.35 A: tentatively came went back to normal 

192.81 193.47 A: um 

194.40 197.28 A: i haven't really i mean i don't travel much so like airlines i mean

202.18 202.53 A: um 

202.63 204.09 B: well you know i was in 

203.17 203.85 A: since uh 

204.24 206.94 B: i was in washington d._c. on the day it happened 

207.47 208.03 A: really 

208.40 212.64 B: in fact i was in fact i was in europe for the previous 

213.28 216.72 B: week i had been away from home for a couple of weeks and i just flew back 

216.87 220.71 B: to uh washington on sunday september 

221.47 222.01 B: ninth 

223.01 223.48 A: mhm 

223.25 226.25 B: because i had a i had a meeting on uh september tenth 

226.46 228.07 B: and on the tenth 

228.42 230.09 B: which is monday i remember that 

230.28 230.70 B: uh 

230.70 231.13 A: mhm 

231.52 236.09 B: my uh boss said to me in washington he said uh 

237.18 237.99 B: could you um 

239.09 244.50 B: could you stay uh for a meeting tomorrow and i said oh no i've been away from home for two weeks i just been i'm just 

244.60 247.61 B: crawling to get i i i can't stay he said well 

247.79 249.06 B: just stay for the morning

254.64 257.81 B: for the morning of september eleventh but i'm leaving at noon for sure 

258.80 259.14 B: well 

260.99 265.15 B: obviously i did not leave at noon in fact i didn't leave for quite a while 

265.57 266.21 B: um 

266.75 267.60 B: so that was 

268.86 270.41 B: uh very painful actually 

270.25 272.62 A: how many extra days did you have to stay in washington 

273.71 276.92 B: actually i finally got out on uh 

277.06 278.03 B: friday 

279.53 280.39 B: uh but 

280.96 283.00 B: things were so chaotic that you know i couldn't 

283.17 283.50 B: i 

283.64 285.22 B: couldn't have a non stop flight 

285.38 287.02 B: to san francisco so they 

287.60 290.85 B: routed me through portland but one thing and another um 

291.76 294.87 B: and they actually i actually missed my flight so i 

294.99 297.38 B: stayed over night in portland and finally got home on saturday 

299.20 299.87 A: wow 

299.24 300.05 B: one of the interesting 

300.34 306.85 B: things uh uh when we were sitting there um waiting to depart on friday afternoon from 

307.70 310.95 B: washington dulles on united airlines 

311.05 314.92 B: the pilot actually c- came back and walked down the aisle 

315.82 320.18 B: uh singled out a middle eastern looking guy and kicked him off the airplane 

321.49 321.93 A: oh 

323.15 324.54 A: bet he wasn't too happy 

326.10 331.14 B: well i su- well he actually he didn't say much you know there were actually a number of a number there were 

331.28 333.54 B: more than one middle eastern looking guys on there but 

333.68 336.86 B: i i think there must have been some irregularity with this one guy 

337.83 338.25 A: mhm 

337.93 338.89 B: and um 

339.59 340.44 B: and they basically 

341.36 342.29 B: gave him the boot 

343.71 344.27 A: yeah 

344.40 347.65 A: i well (( )) everyone felt safe real safe after that 

349.60 351.17 B: so 

349.91 350.36 A: yeah 

351.30 352.08 B: um 

354.37 355.42 B: you know we 

354.72 355.07 A: i 

355.63 358.10 B: we don't like profiling um 

358.84 361.13 B: but it is actually a fairly effective 

361.23 361.73 B: technique 

361.88 362.49 B: for 

363.11 367.55 B: uh making efficient use of our investigative power 

368.26 374.78 B: because if you don't profile i mean profiling you can sort of winnow the population down to the most 

368.35 368.77 A: mhm 

375.47 376.31 B: likely 

376.49 377.22 B: uh 

378.17 379.86 B: uh folks to um 

380.88 381.95 B: to detain 

382.33 383.67 B: uh without that 

384.60 385.79 B: um you really 

385.01 385.33 A: mhm 

387.19 388.89 B: wasting and awful lot of time 

389.98 395.01 A: it it cuts down your uh search possibilities a great deal i um 

395.17 396.96 A: my brother when we we're getting on our airplane 

397.12 397.89 A: they actually he 

398.13 401.74 A: we brought a laptop with us so we could watch movies actually 

401.98 411.40 A: and they he had to stop and take it all apart and pull everything out like take the battery off and they checked every compartment of the bag where his computer was to make sure there's no um 

411.53 412.81 A: contraband 

413.50 415.43 A: which was interesting because my brother is um 

416.37 421.76 A: he's in college which is he just looks very innocent and is very like passive he wouldn't 

422.49 425.90 A: you'd have to really provoke to have him to do any sort of (( violence )) to you 

426.77 427.25 A: but 

428.65 430.03 A: i mean everyone was getting checked 

430.37 430.70 A: and 

430.97 432.61 A: i i mean i work with a lot of 

432.86 433.85 A: middle eastern people 

434.61 436.04 A: um i actually work for 

436.67 439.06 A: the l._d._c. we're the company that's doing this 

439.26 440.20 A: that's (( )) 

442.18 442.76 A: but um 

443.35 444.23 A: this project 

445.06 448.64 A: and the number of what we we do a lot translations and we have a couple arabic 

449.02 451.42 A: programs going on so 

450.61 450.92 B: right 

452.00 455.86 A: it's interesting because i mean i get to see their perspective on it too 

456.56 459.27 B: i imagine the government is very interested in arabic right now 

460.05 461.06 A: oh yes 

461.68 464.19 A: i i know a number of people are 

464.58 466.29 A: talked to a number of them and 

466.50 468.33 A: and people i work with and 

468.96 474.45 A: they've noticed they are actually looking right now for a couple of my friends are graduating college 

474.65 478.16 A: and they're thinking of g- they're criminal justice majors they're thinking of going into um 

478.40 482.33 A: like (( )) f._b._i. and stuff and uh 

482.07 482.43 B: mhm 

482.60 489.55 A: one or two of them speak arabic and i'm like hey you've got a good you got a better chance of getting in there than anybody else right now 

489.76 490.56 B: uh right 

491.33 492.81 B: well it's an interesting language 

493.79 494.24 A: yeah 

494.42 495.32 A: it is it's 

496.31 499.49 A: it's looking (( out )) it's one of the harder ones to learn 

500.04 500.36 A: but 

500.15 501.08 B: oh really why is that 

502.42 504.70 A: uh just their structure is a lot different 

505.21 509.25 A: like i mean i w- what we do mostly is we work with languages and 

509.63 510.99 A: the english language but 

511.35 512.40 A: we deal with um 

513.71 517.25 A: talking to (( )) like the three hardest languages to learn are russian 

517.37 517.84 A: um 

518.23 520.95 A: like chinese and arabic 

521.35 522.44 B: really now why is that 

522.97 525.29 A: it's because there's not it's not 

525.58 528.49 A: with like um say french or spanish 

528.75 529.81 A: there's um 

532.01 533.62 A: there alphabets are similar to ours 

534.61 535.62 A: where as in 

535.72 538.83 A: russian and chinese and it's not 

539.62 541.38 A: the language is completely di- like the 

541.94 544.93 A: alphabet is very different and it's not so much 

545.06 547.02 A: this one is this this one is this 

547.80 548.21 A: um
