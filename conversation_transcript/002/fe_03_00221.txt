42.54 56.64 A: simple things like you know if you're lo- in love and you're meant for each other and honesty and all that good stuff but i think the older i get the more you just want people that are independent and not crazy [laughter]

56.63 60.38 A: (( mhm and it's )) 

60.68 64.97 A: oh i get like minded isn't very very very important 

65.03 69.03 A: because i think at some point a lot of um 

69.98 81.76 A: well you know just a lot of the things that drive you at first to get together attraction and things like that wear off and if your politics and other things aren't in some way compatible then you've got nothing to talk about and a lot of arguments ahead of you 

77.29 78.30 B: yeah 

81.66 83.30 B: (( yeah i hear you on that one ))

108.36 109.25 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

111.91 113.28 A: that sort of thing 

112.88 116.10 B: no but it's a good sign of um responsibility 

115.52 119.06 A: yes you know that you don't live with your mother anymore that kind of thing 

117.99 119.63 B: exactly yeah 

119.49 128.59 A: it's disturbing when you get older and you find out that that's not just a joke on the t._v. that you will encounter a lot of people that yes [laughter] so 

124.53 127.01 B: that people do do that yes 

128.34 135.10 B: i know um yeah uh well i i don't know if you mentioned religion or not but yeah that is kind of 

135.88 138.89 A: oh yeah well spirituality is important [laughter] 

137.76 142.90 B: i dated somebody for two years i'm a catholic she was agnostic and then she turned uh 

143.68 146.64 B: she turned pagan and dumped me for a wiccan 

146.59 147.51 A: oh 

147.43 148.21 B: (( so )) 

148.25 149.94 B: yeah that's important 

149.92 153.04 A: my father broke up with a woman because she became pagan 

153.07 156.19 A: because she insisted he insisted she was a witch it was hysterical 

155.94 156.95 B: (( [laughter] )) 

156.29 163.95 A: i was like no well you know [laughter] i don't think that that's what was going on she might be putting spells on you now but [laughter] 

159.06 159.85 B: so 

163.47 164.93 B: [laughter] 

164.34 166.32 A: (( i don't think so um )) 

166.38 168.10 A: see i wasn't raised um 

168.70 178.25 A: any particular religion so i've never encountered problems with that but um i think that a lot of i'm only twenty three a lot of people aren't particularly 

178.26 180.63 A: excited in their faith um 

180.60 182.17 B: (( yeah that's true mm )) 

181.57 186.26 A: so it's never been a conflict for me but i could imagine that being one 

186.71 188.82 A: (( i just it seems like um )) 

189.50 195.02 A: i've only ever i've dated people that were doubtful christians [laughter] in a way 

195.20 196.12 A: um 

196.92 207.20 A: yeah i can i i i work a many many diverse cultures and i hear a lot of that um sort of thing where you never date someone outside of a particular religion or culture or 

207.34 209.32 A: things like that but i've just never been 

209.40 212.66 A: i i never want to close it off like that 

212.31 215.71 B: yeah i hate being that way myself but there you know 

215.76 217.48 B: after after my one 

217.73 221.91 B: after that one experience um you know it's hard to deny 

223.28 225.25 A: yeah i couldn't just 

223.54 229.28 B: well and it depends on the person of course how important it is for him or her but um 

225.79 227.34 A: well yeah 

228.34 238.49 A: and who you're dating with and and who you're raising children with are very very different it's like i see religion being very difficult to maneuver if you're very different with children 

237.59 241.66 B: yeah it yeah it can be i guess some people can 

242.74 248.22 B: but um and i and i and i yeah and idealistically [cough] 

248.41 249.15 B: try- 

249.33 255.02 B: excuse me try to believe uh it wouldn't be that big of a problem but evidently it did so 

254.93 256.97 A: oh that's unfortunate 

257.76 259.88 B: uh i mean for her i you know 

259.85 260.94 A: [laughter] 

260.53 268.63 B: actually no yeah and eventually it was like i i should have listened to my gut instinct and said nah this is [laughter] 

268.96 271.04 A: [laughter] i understand that 

271.46 273.38 B: uh anyway 

274.60 281.17 A: [laughter] i it's strange i go i didn't to think about it in that sense because i guess i don't really think about it that much 

281.18 286.55 A: like thinking where where where am i going to be when i settle down and decide to have a family i was more raised to 

286.57 287.81 A: not um 

287.97 295.39 A: put that in any of your planning like don't bank on anyone and you know child of multiple divorces like 

295.29 296.33 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

295.71 307.47 A: parents that divorced and remarried and divorced and remarried [laughter] because you will you get to to learn especially as a woman that that's not the way i was supposed to raise myself so it was more get your career 

307.44 313.72 A: get settled and then if you want to some day have children and you know adopt or [laughter] or do it on your on so 

311.71 312.64 B: [laughter] 

313.64 327.49 A: it was i was never thinking that way i've been in a relationship for four years on and off now and that issue keeps kind of coming up here and there not as something directly just as like well we've been together this long and been through this much 

318.88 319.62 B: (( mm )) 

327.63 332.65 A: um it just seems like we might as well get married but it just seems like the wrong reason to 

333.01 336.21 A: [laughter] to do that just like well might as well 

334.40 335.41 B: yeah 

336.45 337.79 A: so [laughter] 

337.11 341.79 B: yeah that does seem bad a bit um i won't say cheesy no 

341.79 343.42 A: it's just it's 

342.58 344.14 B: it's just not a good reason 

343.84 350.87 A: yeah and i'm just 'cause you see a lot of these commercials are at christmas are getting like the sales catalogue and things like that doesn't it's not my idea 

349.26 351.33 B: oh yeah the diamond ones 

350.88 359.25 A: yeah not my idea of i hate those so much 'cause it seems to push this this old ideal on people that just isn't around any more 

358.21 360.48 B: well that they can be bribed you know what i mean 

359.61 362.12 A: well yeah and [laughter] 

361.30 363.26 B: well it's like bribery anyway [laughter] 

363.15 366.62 A: yeah i just uh had a bizarre experience with that um 

366.70 375.42 A: i have a class where the teacher used the amortization of a loan on the diamond ring he bought for his wife 

375.69 376.91 B: right 

376.31 380.05 A: as the like this great example he was it was 

380.06 390.62 A: weird 'cause he was kinda bragging about the size of the diamond and the the amount that he was in debt for and like well if i drive a lexus i have to buy her this kind of ring you know from tiffany's 

390.57 403.87 A: and he's going off for an hour and you know it was applicable in that we did learned we'd learned the formulas to you know multiply out your loan and things like that then at the end of the class i go outside and i'm i'm you know waiting for my boyfriend to pick me up and we're talking 

397.99 399.07 B: right 

403.91 407.76 A: like we always do but he wasn't out front at the time 'cause and he's my teacher 

407.83 411.19 A: and he starts to to to uh try to get me to go to dinner with him 

411.27 412.23 B: [laughter] 

411.78 422.21 A: after he just spend you know this hour talking about his wife and the ring and the getting engaged and being married and how great he was and [laughter] all this stuff it was it was awful [laughter] 

421.59 424.65 B: sounds more like a lecture just about having stopped 

424.13 437.84 A: yeah and i was like you know but you have to wait to axe like a big jerk like this until after you put my grade in you know you can't like this kind of you know exited as quickly as i could without um answering him like oh i don't know i'm not really hungry i gotta go i gotta go [laughter] 

433.95 434.96 B: right 

438.33 443.80 A: but it's not so my idea of partnering for life is just it's like it's something that aliens do 

438.99 439.98 B: (( [laughter] )) 

444.52 446.25 A: or people on the television 

446.74 447.51 B: (( oh )) 

448.03 449.74 A: (( but i don't know i did it )) 

449.92 452.18 A: seems like for some people it works though 

452.22 465.80 A: like i have my grandparents were a wonderful example of when you when you meet the right person and you see them through thick and thin and all that stuff but they also came out of it a different set where that was what you did and that was standard you know 

458.20 459.20 B: right 

466.57 467.74 A: so i don't know 

466.65 467.74 B: no i hear you 

468.37 472.07 A: anything other than i don't want to be with anyone that i argue with [laughter] 

471.69 472.66 B: [laughter] 

476.07 478.45 A: and sounds like a worn out pot think i don't know 

478.72 480.21 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

479.95 481.49 A: are you from the area 

481.80 482.93 A: (( yeah )) 

482.26 485.05 B: which area no actually i'm in portland oregon 

485.42 490.66 A: wow that's awesome i've been talking to people in the university of pennsylvania area 

489.88 498.32 B: yeah i ran across um it was a funny situation uh from hav- i had to take a an internal linguistics class

498.35 500.44 B: at portland state university 

499.95 500.82 A: mhm

503.76 504.52 A: uh-huh 

504.89 506.09 B: and uh 

506.55 510.03 B: during that class i wound up on the on the um 

510.75 521.18 B: e- on the mailing list uh for the for the department of linguistics and i never bothered to get off of it 'til i find this email about this whole thing 

514.66 517.63 A: oh and yeah 

520.80 524.65 A: mhm i actually work for for the linguistics group that is 

524.71 525.94 A: running this study 

526.33 531.27 A: so um i guess i'm probably one of the ones that uh you know about this 

532.35 533.28 B: could be 

533.35 534.59 A: probably 

533.56 534.69 B: um 

534.95 538.85 B: yeah until i found out about the porn service exam and stuff like that 

538.19 541.99 A: (( oh yeah are you um are you looking to go into linguistics or )) 

541.89 543.61 B: i have no idea um 

542.75 543.52 A: no 

544.63 549.67 B: i have no idea i it's the um it's one of those degrees i almost wish i hadn't gotten 

549.41 550.41 A: oh 

550.17 552.97 B: um well there's uh 

553.01 553.95 B: what is it 

554.38 557.63 B: you take econ or some- i don't know the 

559.50 566.41 B: [sigh] there could have been a lot uh more practical things i took it because i knew i i just wanted to get a degree finally 

566.06 567.05 A: yeah 

566.66 574.14 B: um i'm bit of a label owner and i just wanted to have a bachelors to my name and then at that time it didn't matter what 

568.92 569.94 A: [laughter] me too 

571.39 572.51 A: mhm 

573.93 574.90 A: right 

575.25 578.34 B: um but i knew this was gonna happen so 

578.20 579.08 A: (( [laughter] )) 

579.18 583.82 A: well it's all right you can get you get to take classes after you're finished and add onto your degree 

584.12 591.64 B: yeah post back stuff work towards a masters or yeah that's what i'm fearing um but i'd like to earn some money now [laughter] 

584.93 586.42 A: that's what i'm trying too 

591.09 591.87 A: (( [laughter] )) 

592.33 601.86 A: i would like to also i'm working a on women's studies and sociology degree for mastery and theology neither of them seem to have too many prospects as far as a career 

601.62 602.51 B: right 

601.83 604.37 A: and i'm only half way through going part time 

604.34 618.30 A: [cough] and sort of my like seventh year or something like that so you know if i work if i take like six more classes through the fall and summer while i work full time i have um more than one job so this this would be a part time 

618.27 619.26 B: (( oh well [laughter] )) 

618.50 626.55 A: thing then i might be a junior [laughter] by the end of the year so i'm thinking that i'll be in my thirties before i get anywhere and it was always um 

626.80 633.54 A: fun to talk about being a student long term forever but now it's just getting ridiculous and i just have no idea what i want to do 

631.60 632.67 B: yeah it does 

633.87 634.71 A: um 

635.16 646.00 A: other than i would want i wanted to to go into something political or or in education but just not i don't want to be a politician and i don't want a desk job so i don't know i 

646.11 649.48 A: don't know if that's ever going to come true [laughter] so 

649.50 654.01 B: i'm not i'm not the kind that gets interested in you know a career i just want to make the money 

653.68 654.44 A: (( mm )) 

654.33 656.86 B: and then enjoy my own free time 

657.14 658.49 A: (( yeah well you can go into )) 

657.73 661.17 B: it's entirely idealistic i realize but 

660.86 671.26 A: well there there's things you can do i don't know seems like from what i know a lot of people get all kinds of crazy degrees and when they end up in business they make lots of money with humanities degrees buying them that's what you do 

663.06 664.07 B: yeah 

671.20 679.22 A: who you know and how what where you get into and the kinds of certification that you get while you're there rather than what you did for your undergraduate work hm 

672.90 673.79 B: yeah 

679.27 682.28 B: yeah that- that's true i hear that a lot 

682.38 685.93 B: and some i you know i keep an eye out for that but 

686.00 695.05 A: 'cause i don't know anybody that um is working in what they got a degree in now which is disturbing um like twenty people that have finished 

695.17 696.78 A: (( or from from )) 

696.91 704.37 A: i went to st joseph's university for my first two years and then i switched to temple [mn] because i had to leave to work for a while and then 

698.78 699.72 B: (( oh okay )) 

704.39 705.21 A: um 

705.93 713.46 A: you know the people that i know all oh were like well i was a philosophy major i was an english major i was a psychology major and they're all doing 

713.63 718.06 A: generic desk work at places that are totally unrelated to their fields 

717.75 718.91 B: right 

718.21 719.89 A: and they're so unhappy and it just
