17.73 22.38 B: so i guess our topic is um i couldn't quite understand what the recording said 

22.03 23.27 A: the 

22.70 26.70 B: the strike was that it by the professional athl- athletes 

23.66 24.75 A: yes 

26.22 31.67 A: yes and if we think that they uh deserve the salaries that they already get 

32.85 38.51 B: well [cough] you tell me what you think excuse me [laughter] i think they um 

34.16 36.02 A: heavens no [laughter] 

38.89 42.01 B: really really make out well [laughter] 

41.41 48.71 A: i think that yeah they do make out way too well and they need to stop being babies and just do their 

48.81 51.09 A: entertainment [laughter] 

50.93 54.48 B: yeah and you know if they if they use their money well you know 

54.68 55.67 B: then 

55.72 62.81 B: well you know that's that's what ya you know i mean there are some jobs that pay pretty well and i think that they do get too much money but 

56.49 57.67 A: well yes 

62.82 73.80 B: uh you know if they're if they're using it well but of- often i hear stories about athletes that just gamble away their money and just they don't they don't r- they don't respect their money 

73.38 74.36 A: right 

74.14 75.06 B: you know 

75.55 82.71 A: see though i haven't heard about the gambling and stuff but [sigh] i do just think that you know what uh it's human um 

83.37 90.49 A: [lipsmack] oh what's the word i'm looking for we just tend to live with whatever money we're making 

90.18 91.09 B: yes 

90.80 94.49 A: and uh and we always just want more 

94.37 96.04 B: yeah that's really true 

95.90 99.49 A: and i think a lot of the time with the athletes that 

99.77 104.22 A: they do it i mean they just they make way too much money [laughter] 

103.50 110.54 B: they sure make a lot i'm sure they probably have a lot of insurance and you know travel costs and who knows what all but still 

104.70 105.58 A: yeah 

108.46 109.45 A: right 

111.02 113.25 B: they they really really make out 

113.26 115.34 A: yeah they definitely do that 

114.76 116.26 B: yeah 

115.60 122.28 A: and uh i i don't i don't know do you watch basketball and and baseball and all that 

121.63 131.97 B: [lipsmack] not really i i m- i i see it once and while you know when i go by a t._v. or something like that but we're not i've got six boys and one girls and you know it's funny but we none of us are real big sports fans 

131.80 132.54 A: (( [mn] )) 

131.90 139.34 B: uh i mean my boys are athletic you know and they they do a lot of stuff but they're not you know we haven't just spent 

140.49 145.56 B: bulk of time uh sitting in front of the the tube watching sports 

145.33 146.34 A: yeah 

145.69 152.49 B: and but then when michael jordan was [lipsmack] was doing his three p. thing you know in chicago 

152.58 153.53 B: um 

154.08 159.43 B: you know my i paid a little more attention but not really all that much [laughter] but 

156.78 157.74 A: right 

158.22 162.99 A: yeah see i don't watch any of those we- we're hockey people at our house 

160.42 161.90 B: that was a long time ago 

162.30 164.25 B: oh i see okay 

163.24 164.47 A: [laughter] 

164.42 170.34 B: well i guess ea- to each his own i like i say i i don't but what i do enjoy watching is figure skating 

170.39 172.00 A: yes i like that too 

170.46 171.29 B: that's 

171.48 173.93 B: that's that's very uh 

174.36 176.86 B: i think the rhythm is uh 

175.80 176.76 A: yes 

177.08 179.08 B: it's such a beaut- beautiful sport 

177.12 183.43 A: yeah i don't believe that they make the kinda money as the um like the n._b._a. and 

182.70 184.38 B: no i don't think so 

184.14 185.47 A: yeah 

184.77 199.24 B: no no the others are just it's that's ridiculous but [sigh] don't you think a lot of the reason there's money there is j- because they huh there is a lot of gambling going on about foot- you know because of the sports i think gamble- the sports the games are being gambled on and 

195.64 196.88 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

199.89 201.05 B: you know they 

201.62 204.47 A: yes see i didn't even think about that 

201.70 202.80 B: they uh 

204.24 205.19 B: yeah 

205.43 207.58 B: i think well i happen to have a friend who 

208.32 211.65 B: who has a a boyfriend who who um 

211.84 214.12 B: is just very addicted to sports gambling 

214.08 215.00 A: oh 

214.55 218.04 B: and i didn't really think about it much before that either but 

218.15 221.02 B: [lipsmack] i guess it's done you know quite a bit 

219.62 224.05 A: yeah it actually i i hear that it gets to be really addicting 

224.36 225.18 B: yeah 

225.39 228.00 B: yeah anything like that would be though 

227.17 230.96 A: well 'cause you keep thinking oh i could just make a little bit more money [laughter] 

230.11 233.37 B: yes i know and sometimes it's a lot more but 

233.58 234.73 A: yeah 

234.04 237.18 B: you know and then then you're gonna get into all kinds of graft with 

237.28 240.39 B: setting up their games and stuff like that so 

238.91 239.96 A: (( right )) 

240.17 243.18 A: though about like car racing and stuff 

243.30 246.06 A: see i don't what their salaries are but 

245.62 248.30 B: i have no clue i i 

248.40 252.37 B: [lipsmack] i can't see that you know i mean to me it's just like [lipsmack] 

250.30 253.81 A: yeah i was gonna say i don't they like ever go out on strike or anything do they 

255.18 260.49 B: well are th- are there the big um you know associations like there are with uh 

261.17 265.01 B: baseball and stuff somehow or other i i had the idea that car racing was 

265.02 266.88 B: a little bit more individual 

267.24 269.76 B: but maybe i'm wrong about that i just don't know 

269.57 272.62 A: [lipsmack] um you know what i'm not sure 

272.75 276.18 A: that would be one of those things that well you know what i 

276.39 282.86 A: you know i watch hockey [laughter] i i don't really pay attention to everything else i 

279.11 281.35 B: yeah right so you just don't know 

282.20 283.43 B: yeah 

282.84 293.03 A: i do listen you know to the radio and the and the news and stuff and when they start talking about [sigh] oh baseball's thinking about going on strike and i'm thinking oh people grow up 

292.86 295.16 B: yeah i know that's true 

293.38 294.39 A: you know 

295.45 300.10 A: like everything that's going on in the world you know what live with what you're making if 

295.45 297.09 B: i i completely agree 

299.99 301.64 B: yeah right 

300.25 303.15 A: you're not making it sell something [cough] 

302.26 305.90 B: yeah [laughter] right or just drink water or something 

305.51 310.04 A: yeah exactly cut a few things out beer would be better 

306.75 307.78 B: yeah 

309.43 311.98 B: yeah i agree i agree 

311.91 312.91 A: (( [sigh] )) 

312.02 315.18 B: and there's plenty of people out there that [sigh] 

316.62 322.46 B: oh it's catching um [laughter] no that's okay um there's plenty of people out there that are just 

317.82 319.70 A: so sorry [sigh] 

322.60 327.46 B: you know they they live practically a whole year on what some people spend in a day 

327.16 329.40 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

327.94 330.13 B: you know so it's just 

330.38 335.51 A: it's just it is it it is crazy and it's like the more money you make the more you spend and 

331.14 332.30 B: crazy 

335.05 337.13 B: mhm mhm 

335.64 343.85 A: it's just i don't know i i think a lot of the time i don't know if they come up from homes where they really didn't have much and 

343.58 345.13 B: they're kind of over-reacting 

344.84 346.23 A: yeah 

345.62 346.75 B: that could be 

347.49 349.52 B: and also they don't know how to use it 

349.31 358.57 A: that's true they don't do the investing and stuff 'cause i think okay this is mean of me but i think with like the n._b._a. the basketball guys and stuff 

350.01 352.32 B: and how to handle it because they didn't have it 

352.62 353.58 B: right 

358.18 359.08 B: mhm 

358.76 363.20 A: a lot of them i don't think do the hi- you know they don't get their degrees and stuff 

363.27 364.23 B: mhm 

363.29 366.45 A: they go straight in you know to basketball 

366.62 370.79 A: uh professionally so they they have no other education 

368.14 369.39 B: really 

370.84 372.33 B: oh that's too bad 

371.93 378.44 A: yeah i mean i heard you know i'm sure you've heard it too that they just kinda get pushed through school 

378.57 379.48 B: uh-huh 

379.08 382.34 A: and uh they end up graduating when really they 

382.47 383.69 A: (( s- shouldn't )) 

382.56 384.41 B: they didn't work it yeah 

384.22 385.21 A: you know 

384.70 385.98 B: they didn't learn it 

385.43 389.27 A: [sigh] right so you know i just [sigh] i 

389.52 395.41 A: (( think the n._b._a. is n._b._a. and the baseball are like [laughter] the worst as far as i'm concerned )) 

393.55 397.64 B: yeah yeah well it's it's just a big game like you know a big 

398.02 401.49 B: fraud i mean just a scam [laughter] sort of really 

400.25 401.07 A: yeah 

402.24 403.15 B: but 

402.26 406.61 A: very much so and they just you know they end up making it so that 

406.95 407.90 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

407.92 412.70 A: real people just can't make it to the the uh games and stuff because 

413.13 419.28 A: with their salaries and stuff i think they just are increasing everything so much 'cause they have to make up for it somewhere 

418.97 419.98 B: right 

419.42 421.75 A: [sigh] and we end up paying for it 

421.52 427.80 B: oh yeah right if if we decide to go and watch the game [laughter] we pay for it yeah so 

424.35 425.34 A: right 

427.00 430.64 A: well even [laughter] as my husband said uh 

430.75 438.15 A: if you buy anything that's um being advertised in between on commercials [laughter] you're also supporting them too 

435.12 436.93 B: oh yes right 

437.48 439.42 B: yeah that's true you are 

439.69 443.50 B: yeah but we don't do that much t._v. buying so 

440.56 441.83 A: (( [sigh] ah )) 

443.82 445.43 A: yeah i don't either 

444.43 447.41 B: so that's a good thing yeah yeah 

448.25 450.55 B: so do you have kids that do sports 

450.49 453.16 A: um actually mine are very little they are 

452.53 453.42 B: (( are they )) 

453.49 457.50 A: yeah i've got one that's almost eight and a five and a two year old 

457.24 458.91 B: oh my just got a 

457.90 463.00 A: and the two older ones actually played soccer last year for the first time so 

463.05 465.57 B: oh okay the five and the eight year old 

463.68 465.02 A: (( yeah and ev- )) 

465.89 474.19 A: yeah yeah [sigh] and they actually [laughter] they like to watch the hockey with their dad they're starting to get into that but 

466.44 468.32 B: mhm yeah 

471.71 472.87 B: yeah 

474.11 475.17 B: yeah 

474.58 479.24 A: we don't watch any of the other stuff so they you know they're oblivious to it 

478.94 480.93 B: yeah right 

479.99 482.36 A: which i think is probably better anyway 

482.06 485.39 B: yeah i think so too i think the priorities get it's 

485.60 490.18 B: so easy for to get priorities off center in this s- c- culture 

489.91 491.12 A: oh yes 

490.39 493.99 B: that yeah if if you just focused all the time on you know 

494.25 496.75 B: t._v. sports it would 

497.07 507.45 B: i think you know it really does off off balance the kids 'cause they don't get the priorities they see their parents giving all this priority time wise and and attention and so on on these sports and 

507.01 508.01 A: right 

507.56 510.98 B: they don't they just get a really skewed idea of what 

511.33 513.49 B: priorities are you know 

512.65 516.07 A: yeah and especially the ones that um [lipsmack] 

516.23 518.89 A: their moms are single moms 

519.12 526.23 A: and their dads aren't in the picture you know 'cause they're looking at they're looking at these guys and thinking oh you know 

520.12 522.66 B: right oh yeah that's right 

526.31 528.21 B: well they're kinda like heroes to 'em 

527.96 530.55 A: yeah which is really sad because [mn] 

528.72 530.02 B: i suppose 

530.12 531.68 B: yeah it is sad 

532.14 538.25 A: and they don't care and they just do their own thing but you know what that's their their rights 

532.29 533.18 B: but 

537.86 538.68 B: right 

538.48 539.68 A: but uh 

539.98 542.84 B: (( no you don't have to give them respect yeah )) 

540.02 541.73 A: i don't know i think when 

542.48 543.53 A: (( yeah )) 

543.96 548.22 A: [laughter] [sigh] i'm sorry i have a cold [laughter]
