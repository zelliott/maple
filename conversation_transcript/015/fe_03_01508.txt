29.86 30.99 A: (( oh okay )) 

30.81 36.10 B: all right so um i'm sorry my roommate was talking and the topic was what was it the 

35.31 37.14 A: um september eleventh 

36.61 37.65 B: okay 

37.37 42.94 A: and they wanted to know what if any changes we had made um i guess in our lifestyles since then 

40.30 41.39 B: (( [noise] [mn] ah )) 

42.74 44.58 B: okay um 

44.69 50.53 B: well jeeze i haven't even really even thought about something like that but uh how about you like what about you 

50.10 56.56 A: um i don't know if i've made any changes i know one of the things that maybe i've done a little differently is um 

56.98 60.21 A: um my son i have a son and his mother lives in new york 

59.63 60.57 B: mhm 

60.18 66.86 A: um he lives with and i know i guess the only thing we have done differently is um right when it happened of course he uh 

66.82 78.89 A: and i guess it kinda changed the frequency that i took him up there to visit um like right after it happened of course like the city was almost like cordoned off so it was just kinda hard to get up there so we didn't uh 

71.60 72.54 B: yeah 

76.50 77.37 B: right 

79.09 82.31 A: make any trips there for probably two or three months afterwards 

81.75 83.64 B: oh yeah how old is your son 

83.27 84.68 A: um he's eight 

84.41 85.48 B: okay 

85.26 89.31 A: so he um he has been living with me since he was born and uh 

89.33 99.22 A: even now it's st- like while the war was going on i know i was a little leery about taking him up there when the war first started you know you know i didn't know what to expect if there was going to be any terrorist attacks or 

95.20 96.22 B: mhm 

98.92 100.04 B: right 

99.42 107.68 A: um even the demonstrations i guess uh kind of kept me from going up there so i i was kinda like waiting to see what would happen before i took him to new york 

105.91 106.90 B: (( [noise] )) 

107.47 113.08 B: rea- oh wow well i guess that is kind of a difficult choice make especially um 

110.71 112.10 A: right right 

113.07 123.48 B: well i don't really have anything that particular i don't have any family that lives up there so um really what it was for me is i didn't know what happened until halfway through the day 'cause i was at classes 

120.76 122.07 A: right 

122.97 124.04 A: (( oh okay )) 

123.35 128.51 B: and so after it happened my roommate at the time told me about it and she 

128.55 130.27 B: um nobody really was 

130.18 144.96 B: relating to what actually happened we were all just kinda like okay you know maybe like when that bomb went off like back in the early nineties we all kinda thought it was something like that and she eventually was like no it's not there any more you know it's gone and it pretty much hit me in the sense though 

136.39 137.52 A: right 

138.25 139.12 A: right 

144.81 154.07 B: it was really it was just kinda like something that was surreal and you really had to think closely of who was the most important people in your life because you don't know when they're gone just as you know 

152.08 152.94 A: right 

154.19 162.02 B: you would have that decision to have to make about your son and and it is like decisions where you had to put more thought into things so that's kinda how it was for me 

159.89 161.05 A: (( right right )) 

161.57 162.55 A: okay 

162.22 163.17 B: so 

163.29 170.84 B: and i haven't i've been up there i just was up there a few weeks ago so it was the first time i'd been there since since it happened but uh 

167.68 168.65 A: okay 

169.40 170.55 A: right 

171.14 172.37 B: so um 

172.50 186.29 B: you know i really can't say that there's much of a change i would have particularly made but just the fact that it was something that ever since then you know you hear nine eleven or something like that and you know exactly what it is and and it's a thing that everybody can relate to now so 

174.31 175.39 A: right 

182.57 183.67 A: right 

185.00 187.62 A: yeah and i i think it something that um 

187.82 198.77 A: it's funny like almost everyone you know in some way either knew someone or like they can tell you a story um i know for me personally i had a friend i went to school with he went to temple also and uh 

193.73 194.73 B: (( yeah )) 

199.26 206.63 A: he had um developed kidney failure maybe four or five years back so he had to wait for transplant for years 

201.89 202.54 B: (( mm )) 

203.21 204.04 B: mhm 

206.48 216.50 A: and uh i remember his mom called me the september twelfth early in the morning and she said that uh lonnie's in the hospital and they she said that they think they found a kidney for him 

210.99 211.83 B: yeah 

215.89 216.96 B: oh wow 

216.33 226.43 A: and right away the first thing came to my mind i thought uh-oh i bet it was someone who who died in nine eleven and sure enough it was it was a a guy his age a young guy who had worked in the world trade center 

220.56 221.58 B: right 

225.96 228.29 B: wow that's really touching yeah 

227.21 239.41 A: and yeah so i guess that i guess always is on my mind like i can't help but when i see him sometimes i just think about that and wow he's you know some- someone he's directly affected by what happened you know on september eleventh 

236.88 237.82 B: yeah 

238.88 242.05 B: like in so many bad things there was somebody's angel 

241.47 243.40 A: right right exactly 

242.15 246.79 B: like they didn't know it was gonna happen and somebody was there to [mn] [noise] 

245.00 253.65 A: yeah yeah so in that kind of way i kinda you know when i look at him i think wow you know your life changed or was extended because of someone else's you know ended that day 

250.87 252.16 B: mhm 

253.15 264.70 B: exactly wow i never even thought of it as something like that 'cause you know right after it happened everyone was giving blood and stuff and like it just kinda passed over my head that like i gave my blood and i just kinda felt it was something that people did you know 

258.14 259.74 A: right right 

263.92 264.69 A: right 

264.59 275.90 B: just bec- out of the pure benefit and like the fact that it was so touching right away and wow you see i never actually have heard a story like that you know that it was it was actually something as sad as it was something good came through 

275.09 277.05 A: right right 

276.44 278.89 B: so is your friend okay now is he doing better 

277.74 288.76 A: yeah he's he's almost i mean it was ironic because the kidney he got was almost like a perfect match for him like a lot of times you know they you your body can reject th- you know somebody else's organ but 

288.54 296.53 A: in his case they were amazed they just thought that um the person may have been related to him it was so close i mean they couldn't tell him who it came from but uh 

295.77 296.85 B: really 

296.71 303.83 A: they were able to let him like write a letter to the family just thank 'em and stuff like that and they just uh gave to 'em like anonymous- anonymously but uh 

298.78 300.54 B: oh good i was gonna ask that 

303.07 304.08 B: oh good 

304.06 308.16 A: yeah so that's something that i i always think about every time i i see him 

307.59 308.57 B: yeah 

308.45 316.64 B: that is something it's something i think a lot of people think about and even today like with the fact that there's a war and you know the terrorist in itself that people just continuously 

313.21 314.11 A: right 

316.47 319.45 B: like can relate to what actually happened to us 'cause 

319.25 333.42 B: i think uh americans themselves underestimate what what we how powerful we really are and how a simple like blink can take away so so much and that we're not as powerful because you know we're we're weaker than we probably think we are 

322.20 323.21 A: right 

324.37 325.39 A: right 

327.63 328.53 A: yeah 

333.06 334.20 A: right 

333.59 337.10 B: so do you have any friends over across seas or anything or 

336.90 344.45 A: no uh-uh i had only had one friend who was in the military but he's he's back he was in japan for a little while but now he's back here 

342.97 343.95 B: (( oh okay )) 

344.13 345.09 B: oh good 

344.68 351.75 A: you know one thing i did uh think of too uh just uh on another topic which is i think the one thing that has happened is um 

346.53 347.59 B: mhm 

351.82 353.51 A: flying habits 

352.92 354.00 B: yes 

353.62 360.55 A: you know like right afterwards you know i didn't fly for a while um i've i've gotten back to flying regularly now but i know that i'm just 

356.12 357.02 B: mhm 

360.84 367.21 A: i guess how earl- how often or ho- how early i get to the airport stuff like that that has changed 

365.07 365.91 B: mhm 

366.61 367.76 B: right 

367.15 378.93 A: um and also um i guess being a little bit more like alert or you know it's funny 'cause the first time flew after that like i could just feel that everybody's on the plane like looking at everybody else like mm you know what i mean like 

376.91 383.58 B: yeah i had the exact same problem actually where do you do you fly a lot like around okay 

379.23 380.92 A: right uh 

382.07 390.79 A: pretty much like back and forth to miami um california places like that i i had the job i have now like will send me to different places so 

390.13 391.01 B: okay 

390.71 399.73 A: yeah i mean i'm comfortable about it it never really bothered me that w- but i know that you know right away if i just had uh always looking at people a little differently or 

398.93 400.84 B: right right 

399.77 410.55 A: or wondering like you know okay we'll what are even it it crosses your mind like even on a plan- okay well if someone were to try do something what would i do would i would i try yeah would i try to react or help out or 

406.43 408.78 B: exactly like how would you get out of it 

410.22 414.37 B: i was the same way actually i didn't even think about that but that's like a perfect thing i had 

412.57 413.48 A: (( yeah )) 

413.87 415.00 A: right 

414.44 416.74 B: i went to um last year 

416.64 426.14 B: two thousand two i went to rome for spring break and when i was coming back uh i was on the plane and they had an hour delay because one of the bags wasn't checked like it went through 

424.93 426.56 A: okay right 

425.95 439.99 B: and immediately i just i when i was waiting to get on the plane they had to stop a man 'cause he was trying to get on and immediately it was like ran through my head like where is this guy is on our plane you know and that is something that it's just something that you think about in the back of your head but 

431.42 432.31 A: okay 

434.75 436.76 A: right right 

439.89 447.51 B: i didn- it didn't even occur to me until you just said something now that there really is like we're more cautious of how things go 

445.90 446.89 A: right 

447.09 458.15 A: yeah that's something i i can- like even now i i just can't help but think about it you know just the way they it's not as bad as when it first was but it's just the way that you have to go through these checks now and 

447.79 448.67 B: huh 

457.54 458.86 B: mhm 

458.23 470.72 A: um even when i when um i fly with my son a lot too and even one time i was flying with him and the- and just the scrutiny that they went over him and you know that had never happened before like they were like asking to take his shoes off because what they do is it seems like i guess um 

460.70 461.46 B: [noise] 

466.61 467.56 B: right 

470.61 475.19 A: every so many people they randomly have to just stop whoever the person is 

474.59 475.63 B: right 

475.21 483.47 A: and um they give you old person young person in his case and i was you know annoyed because they were like putting him through all this and i guess i was trying to understand and be understanding but i just thought they were 

482.09 483.01 B: right 

483.48 486.63 B: at the same time it's like an eight year old kid [laughter] 

483.57 484.65 A: just uh 

484.75 495.70 A: yeah exactly and they were like being insensitive 'cause he was like you know dad you know and they were like kinda keeping me away from him so i'm like okay well i don't you doing it but let me stay near so he knows 'cause he doesn't know you know exactly what's going on so 

489.92 490.88 B: mhm 

493.77 495.09 B: exactly 

495.11 496.80 B: like he's not used to that 

496.10 501.91 A: right right so he was kinda like you know he wasn't crying but he was looking like okay well why ar- what are they doing to me 

501.16 502.17 B: right 

501.92 516.16 A: so uh that part is a lot different so i know that even now i'm always kinda like oh well i hope i don't have to i hope he's not the person that gets picked or either one of us because i don't even like him to have to stand and watch them you know like make me go through that while he's like away from me for a little bit 

513.34 514.28 B: right 

515.48 518.63 B: has he um changed in any way like now that you have 

518.66 524.08 B: you're more cautious about traveling him and bring him up to new york stuff do you feel like he's changed at all 

522.19 533.95 A: um a little bit i i know that when it happened for him he was old enough to know i guess he was six then and he knew uh the first thing he came home from school they sent the kids home early from school that day even here in philadelphia 

533.42 534.36 B: yes 

534.12 538.85 A: and he came home and he the first thing he told me was that he had cried he said uh they said that um 

539.24 547.21 A: um something in new york had blown up and you know they not realizing how big new york is the first thing he thought was oh i hope my mom- my mommy wasn't hurt so 

546.33 547.41 B: right 

547.21 560.57 A: you know i assured him that she wasn't she worked nearby but not you know close enough to be to be directly affected by it but uh i was explaining to him that she was fine and of course we can't talk to her that day 'cause the phone lines i mean you couldn't even call in new york it was bad for a while 

551.33 552.50 B: oh good 

552.88 553.89 B: good 

557.91 559.15 B: oh i know 

560.57 573.36 A: but i noticed that uh he was aware of that and i know even now he whenever the mention anything about terrorists or anything that's the first thing he thinks of or he'll mention uh is my mom okay or you know it it did you talk to her or you know did she call 

567.50 568.43 B: mhm 

572.75 574.11 B: yeah 

573.56 576.76 A: so i guess he he does think about it a long those lines but uh 

576.90 582.71 A: i gu- he understands like i always try to point out to him like we're gonna you know be more careful about when we travel and 

582.16 583.38 B: (( right [noise] )) 

582.66 592.53 A: just to maybe the way we travel like before a lot of times i would go up on the train and things like that and sometimes now i'll drive just to be a little bit in control of like mov- moving around 

591.93 593.18 B: (( yeah )) 

592.62 595.69 A: you know i guess that that has affected me a little bit too 

595.94 598.77 A: so um and i think he was fine as a matter of fact 

598.78 599.89 A: like i said other
