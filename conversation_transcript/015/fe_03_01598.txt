1.45 2.76 A: hello 

2.83 4.18 A: i'm sherry 

3.03 3.94 B: hi 

4.35 6.42 B: i'm john how do you do 

5.33 6.48 A: hi john 

7.32 10.06 B: okay topic of conversation 

10.18 20.36 B: is uh airport security uh what making us any safer [laughter] i think to an extent i don't think it's um 

14.67 15.65 A: yeah 

20.81 26.60 B: doing a whole lot i it's as far as i'm concerned it's one of those things where uh 

27.54 32.84 B: i don't think they're they're anybody's looking to repeat what happened on nine eleven 

33.24 43.77 A: [mn] oh no i don't think that either but i think also um even the guy that got caught not too long ago i think he had like scissors or a or a knife or something 

44.12 45.73 A: and um 

46.53 50.24 A: it was like a big thing like how did he get past security with that 

50.50 59.94 A: i don't think everybody's doing their job i think some people taking it serious and i think some of 'em are just it's not gonna happen again kinda you know attitude 

60.35 63.15 A: like they they don't really expect that a 

60.48 61.58 B: well 

63.19 70.40 A: there's there's so much um concern more so like keeping their job more than they are about really checking anybody 

70.54 74.80 A: i think you get checked more for if you have germs or something like that 

74.86 76.32 A: 'cause that um 

76.62 85.72 A: last time i went to the airport and all i was doing was um picking up my daughter they asked me to take my shoes off they examined my shoes and they wanted to wipe my feet and you know 

86.06 88.25 B: [laughter] 

87.39 90.23 A: so i thought that was a little crazy but 

90.71 91.82 A: i don't know 

91.81 99.34 B: well i don't know i think i think if somebody is that determined and isn't afraid to die i don't think eventually you're gonna be able to stop 'em we- 

99.07 100.18 A: right 

100.30 101.36 A: right 

102.02 104.89 A: and i the other thing is um 

105.43 108.01 A: now they got the um captains 

108.06 110.44 A: um i mean the um pilots 

110.50 113.25 A: um training to carry guns 

113.91 114.99 A: so 

115.34 119.04 A: i'm thinking like how you gonna be able to fly that plane and shoot 

119.88 122.65 A: and and and also make sure that um 

123.44 127.71 A: that you're not aiming at the wrong thing that'll actually put the plane in danger 

128.79 131.43 B: well ho- honestly i mean 

131.36 133.09 B: the pilots carrying guns 

132.94 143.78 B: they can be trained and they can be armed with the proper weaponry that's not gonna cause you know that's not gonna cause more harm than good but where they had to start with 

141.46 142.47 A: mhm 

143.64 148.20 B: security on the airplane is actually the barrier between the pilots and the cabin 

145.33 146.10 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

148.90 154.33 B: i mean if if the pilots have time to you know unsheathe a weapon that's fine 

154.29 164.42 B: but they have to make sure that that door in between the uh cabin and the where the pilots sit is you know strong enough to keep people from being able to you know break it down with relative ease 

163.96 165.85 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

166.74 168.24 A: yeah um 

168.81 175.04 A: i kn- i was watching someone in training that they was showing on um i think it was good morning america 

175.18 178.35 A: and it was really strange because um 

179.11 180.25 A: [noise] the guy 

180.28 184.31 A: look- didn't look like they was in the best of health theirselves you know 

184.33 186.17 B: what the pilot 

185.78 193.03 A: yeah they were like like really like overweight and um like they was really struggling with the whole thing 

193.33 195.84 A: [noise] with the whole training session and everything 

196.86 199.59 B: well i can i mean i didn't see it i 

199.87 205.98 B: i i'm really wary of anything i see on you know on pretty much anything on t._v. 

205.73 206.62 A: mhm 

206.47 208.24 B: i i mean they're what 

208.46 218.39 B: you have to understand in that situation is they're trying to make a story whether there's a story there or not so i kinda take it with a grain of salt i think it's just a 

218.64 231.23 B: kinda one link in the chain as far as training the uh pilots and they're and you know it's like heck how many cops do you see that are you know overweight and out of shape you know [laughter] come on i mean 

222.33 224.17 A: mhm 

228.71 232.37 A: [laughter] yeah you're right you're right 

232.40 235.62 B: yeah they if if they've pretty much 

235.66 246.10 B: um you know lowered the standards for so many different uh occupations you know in the name of you know equality or whatever 

246.03 256.57 B: you know instead of just you know i don't care you know what gender you are what uh you know what race what anything but you know just have a set standard whoever makes it makes it you know i mean 

255.54 257.98 A: mhm 

256.47 265.58 B: they could do the same thing for pilots i i think pilots should have a certain standard of health for crying out loud you know the last thing you need is a guy having a heart attack up in the air 

265.02 266.46 A: right right mhm 

265.61 266.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

267.16 268.58 B: but um 

268.52 282.20 B: as far as uh you know airport security especially what they do at the airport some of it is so ridiculous that you know i mean any time that they set a certain standard and it's all black and white and there's no you know um 

282.38 284.23 B: common sense involved 

284.40 292.17 B: you know it's i don't know i just have a problem with that i think overall the way they've done you know and the thing is 

292.24 303.71 B: i'm i tend to be pretty conservative you know i wouldn't want to call myself a republican but i am pretty conservative and i think the normal what you consider conservatives are republicans with their 

303.68 309.41 B: um homeland security are just going crazy as far as you know trying to 

309.58 322.33 B: you know take away so many of our what we would normally consider our rights in the name of keeping us secure i'm sorry but i guess i'd rather risk a little bit more security and not uh have people snooping around so much 

321.78 328.36 A: [noise] yeah yeah because i notice um the other policy that came here in phili was that um 

329.12 334.90 A: when they check your luggage and everything they want everything like in a clear bag it's like a random check that they do 

335.04 336.92 A: and they want everything like 

337.38 338.83 A: where they can see it 

338.87 344.93 A: so then so they had like all these stipulations you had to do was as far as how you baggage up your luggage and everything 

345.54 348.21 A: which was a little bit more complicated 

348.24 354.98 A: because now you you're having to put everything like in individual bags 'cause you don't want anybody just touching your personal items you know 

354.50 355.81 B: right 

355.51 356.85 A: and um 

357.15 358.38 A: it just seemed like 

358.80 367.78 A: you had to get to the airport early anyway but now it was like you had to get there extra early just in order to um go through the whole checking process 

367.89 369.59 A: just to board the plane 

370.98 372.24 A: (( so it was like )) 

372.65 376.26 A: after everything that happened nine eleven it seems like we're all 

376.84 381.12 A: being held responsible for what happened then because 

381.22 384.23 A: i guess security wasn't tight enough or whatever 

385.74 388.86 B: (( yeah i you know i don't know as as far as )) 

388.71 403.59 B: you know and and y- no you tell me how you know you're being in phili i'm in i'm like forty miles east of milwaukee in the middle of wisconsin i don't feel i don't feel very threatened by anything i'm not really in a very large important metropolitan area 

396.72 397.63 A: okay 

403.00 404.02 A: (( oh okay )) 

403.43 407.98 B: but i i probably have a much different way of looking at it i mean i'm not uh 

407.81 418.93 B: i'm not worried [laughter] you know there are a lot bet- better targets than you know we are around here so i have i guess i have a little bit different way of looking at it plus um i 

419.07 421.17 B: don't tend to uh 

421.48 424.63 B: i don't watch the network news for one thing 

423.90 425.60 A: okay [laughter] 

424.55 438.92 B: i try and get my news from a lot of different sources whether it be cable news or you know on one hand i'll watch fox news which is really right wing and then i'll listen to a public radio which is really on the left i think i get kind of my own balance that way [laughter] 

438.46 439.79 A: mhm 

439.20 443.05 B: um and um y- i think 

442.49 451.84 A: i try to watch a little bit of everything but it's like like if you watch c._n._n. and c._n._n. and oh goodness then it's like 

452.15 459.06 A: the stories that they come up with you know and you're like gosh you know and it's almost if you really 

459.03 473.09 A: listen to it it'll shake you you know like if you go for just that and then you hear somebody else opinion on the radio about some of the things that's going on as far as the terroristic you know threats and everything you know and then you have people that are not so 

473.62 475.55 A: scared but they're just like 

475.60 484.23 A: if it's meant to be it'll happen you know just like everybody was buying gas masks and everything 'cause they just knew that that there was gonna be like this big um 

480.45 481.47 B: right 

484.67 487.27 A: uh germ warfare thing going on 

487.41 493.34 B: well the biggest joke in the world is when they were telling everybody to buy duck tape and disprin you know i mean [laughter] 

487.42 488.38 A: and then 

491.22 498.14 A: right yeah and a and a and a home depot around here ran out of duck tape and the plastic to cover your window 

497.47 498.58 B: [laughter] 

498.26 503.59 A: and it was so crazy 'cause i was sitting here saying to myself but if it's meant for you to go you're gonna go 

504.15 510.25 A: but um i'm not really worried so much about the terroristic threat as 

510.35 513.33 A: i'm worried about the people in my own neighborhood 

513.99 520.42 B: yeah i mean that's true too and you know and that i if you know you're worried like you said you're worried about your 

515.03 517.09 A: [laughter] 

520.23 532.68 B: safety in your own neighborhood and you know i do i work in downtown milwaukee a lot and i work actually i'm an electrical contractor and i get into the public schools a lot and the conditions there can be just terrible 

525.21 526.40 A: mhm 

532.01 533.31 A: mhm 

532.65 547.48 B: you know and it's like to me that's a much larger threat to you know everything to everybody you know from on a day to day basis than some you know unseen terrorist maybe you know doing something 

545.85 547.16 A: [laughter] 

547.28 554.55 A: right and i work for um the state and i'm a clerk and when they had the anthrax thing that was going on 

555.04 560.50 A: um they made us all put on clerk i mean put on all the clerks put on gloves if they was gonna open up mail 

560.95 571.21 A: and just like about a month ago somebody found some white powder and which was uh we all believe was just an accident like some senior citizen trying to fill out an application might've dropped their medicine in it 

571.03 581.36 A: and through the mail process it got crushed and everybody was like it was anthrax it was anthrax you know and everybody's all scared and nervous and like i wanna go home i wanna go to the hospital i wanna get checked you know 

581.62 590.52 A: and then the management was like it's nothing to worry about we'll just go get it tested and if anything comes back then we'll deal with it from there 

590.96 599.62 A: [laughter] which i thought was a little crazy but i was saying to myself well all the things that people are so concerned about how do you just take such a mediocre 

592.13 593.23 B: yeah
