0.35 1.52 B: hello 

0.92 3.37 A: hi this is diana 

3.07 4.67 B: and this is jamilla 

5.58 11.77 B: um airport security i don't know have you have you um visited the airport since nine eleven 

7.13 8.08 A: yeah 

11.70 14.43 A: yes i just went yesterday [laughter] 

13.79 15.32 B: [laughter] how was it 

15.19 16.96 A: well um 

17.33 24.72 A: i had gone to meet my niece and because of nine eleven i couldn't get up to where she was at 

25.34 30.26 A: so we didn't get to meet until um and she was leaving for um 

30.11 41.95 A: madrid [laughter] and she was young so i i didn't like that they need t- i like the security i understand it but they need to have some sort of an alternative 

31.31 32.59 B: (( oh okay [lipsmack] )) 

41.96 46.46 A: for people you know to be able to get in touch with people who are just on layovers 

46.44 53.01 B: right okay so she was on a layover i have um i have not um i don't really fly too much 

52.95 63.78 B: but i do have um a couple of friends and coworkers that had have to had to travel since nine eleven one coworker for example they checked her shoes um 

63.73 70.86 B: they these were supposed to be random checks but she just happened to be checked for everything this particular flight they checked her shoes they checked her body 

70.97 74.80 B: they check- they checked her luggage um she almost missed her flight 

74.44 75.32 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

74.86 84.31 B: so just certain things like that um i do appreciate the fact that they do these random checks but you just may not check the right person 

84.48 85.55 A: mhm 

84.84 90.06 B: [laughter] so for her that was i think that was an experience for her 

89.98 92.17 A: yeah i mean if they're going to 

92.32 101.12 A: if it's you know 'cause she almost missed her flight then they need to make the public aware that you know you really need to come an hour or two hours just in case 

94.57 95.30 B: yeah [noise] 

100.83 102.03 B: (( right [noise] )) 

102.00 109.52 A: because otherwise you know if she had of missed her flight i'm pretty sure they wouldn't have paid for that or given her [laughter] another flight for free 

109.27 110.67 B: exactly 

110.95 116.39 B: so and as far as the like the shoe bombers i don't know i don't think that 

111.14 111.98 A: so 

116.95 117.91 B: um 

117.98 125.52 B: they should i [mn] i i would think that they would have some kind some kind of equipment that once you walk through it they would be able to check your shoes that way 

125.21 126.20 A: mhm 

125.94 130.78 B: instead of you having to take off your shoes that could take up a lot of time 

131.52 140.43 A: yeah i'm also wondering bec- well see the thing of it is is if it's not um a metal then they won't be able to pick it up with a metal detector 

140.35 141.49 B: right 

140.96 155.52 A: and i i believe that the guy who had the shoes didn't have metal in it it was plastic explosives and things like that so it may have not been able to be picked up even if they would've you know ran it through an x-ray or something because it's not metal 

146.92 147.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

147.91 149.14 B: right 

156.16 161.32 A: so i i just think it's really tough for them to [laughter] keep it safe 

162.14 172.00 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] i'm not sure what they could do to to improve airport security um i'm not really sure like i said i don't fly a whole lot i just hear other people's experiences 

172.06 174.37 B: so i'm not really sure what could be done 

175.17 180.16 B: to increase that yeah you tell people to come two two and a half hours you know before their flight 

180.50 183.78 B: but sometimes it takes a little bit longer than that 

183.70 187.06 A: mhm well i've never flown so 

186.48 187.91 B: (( oh okay [sigh] )) 

187.58 191.54 A: the first time that i was really in a major airport was yesterday 

192.24 193.63 A: and um 

193.74 204.79 A: just the enormity of the people i have no idea how they are keeping it safe [laughter] because any- everybody running every which way and [sigh] all these different people going everywhere and 

204.90 208.62 A: it just seems that it would be impossible to do 

206.17 207.14 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

208.57 209.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

209.59 213.99 B: yeah and they're also they're also having um 

213.37 214.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

214.41 222.62 B: t- it's to the point where you cannot like you said you couldn't see her for her layover even if you drop someone off at the airport you have to drop them off at the front door 

222.20 223.52 A: (( mhm )) 

223.18 230.32 B: so it's i don't know how they're doing it with um i had a friend that took her daughter her daughter i think was twelve [lipsmack] 

230.82 235.99 B: to the airport and she couldn't go too far with her and i don't think that that's right you know that's a child 

237.07 237.96 A: yeah 

237.13 238.86 B: that that needs that 

239.84 243.59 B: that parent there with them up until the flight 

243.17 244.38 A: (( mhm )) 

244.43 259.08 A: or they need to have some sort of a place that the parent and the child can wait far enough away for for everybody to feel safe until and then get somebody to come and you know take the child directly to her airline [laughter] to the gate and everything 

249.65 250.56 B: right 

257.39 258.55 B: exactly 

259.13 267.69 A: because that's what i was worried about because my niece had never flown before and she had flown down from pittsburgh and then she was going to go on to madrid 

267.70 275.00 A: and she you wanted her aunt there [laughter] to you know talk to and for the four hours that she was gonna be there 

274.44 276.57 B: oh wow four hours how old is she 

276.18 277.78 A: she's uh fifteen 

277.62 278.73 B: okay 

278.57 280.46 A: but still you know 'cause she 

279.30 281.00 B: yeah that's a long time 

280.81 282.82 A: and she'd never flown and 

283.03 292.66 A: so i mean they had where you could page people but she you know she's not going to know to listen and it's so busy and so we never did hook up [laughter] 

293.17 298.49 A: so it just it it was just very it wasn't just as inconvenient it was just 

298.89 311.48 A: there should've been something that they could've set in place like somebody to go and physically get her to bring her to me or to physically go and to get her a message or you know something like that 

302.70 303.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

304.50 305.79 B: (( [noise] right )) 

306.04 307.21 B: exactly 

311.86 325.30 A: 'cause if i would've known i didn't even know that you couldn't get up to where i knew you couldn't get you know on the airline obviously but i thought well people will come off and then you know you know how you saw it on t._v. where they hug and all that stuff and i thought well you know 

324.22 327.30 B: [lipsmack] right yeah they cut all of that out 

325.36 326.27 A: then 

326.93 334.38 A: yeah i didn't know that until yesterday [laughter] so then it was we couldn't even get past the atrium 

334.57 336.75 A: so but i mean 

335.15 336.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

337.64 339.31 A: i understand it 

339.52 343.40 A: i just think that they need to have it better organized 

343.64 357.68 B: [noise] right uh-hum [lipsmack] yeah i haven't flown since i'd say i haven't flown for maybe about five or six years [noise] i just don't really like flying on airplanes [laughter] so i try to stay away from it as much as i can 

353.31 354.40 A: uh-huh 

358.12 363.77 B: as much as i can i try to stay away from the airports and i think since nine eleven it's gotten a whole lot worse 

364.00 371.63 B: just my whole security my feeling of of security just is not there regarding the airports i do not like i said [noise] i don't know what they could do 

371.77 375.53 B: that would make me feel more secure in the airports 

376.38 380.92 A: [mn] i can't think so either because i was worrying anyway about the airplane crashing 

380.81 381.72 B: (( right )) 

380.96 384.42 A: now i have to worry about it either being blown in you know up or 

384.26 397.08 A: driven into something and that's just too i'll just drive [laughter] you know even if it's long distance i would rather drive because then i'm in control of my vehicle and i can you know keep secure because it's my vehicle 

385.83 387.00 B: mhm 

388.71 389.62 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

396.89 398.00 B: right 

397.92 403.51 A: so i don't know either i think that that's probably why a lot of people aren't flying 

403.65 407.08 B: [noise] mhm except for like business [noise] [noise] 

404.62 405.83 A: and that 

406.46 415.72 A: yeah and even then i think that 'cause i just knew somebody who drove from um philadelphia down to atlanta instead of flying 

415.84 416.86 B: right 

416.69 418.08 A: so i mean 

418.48 428.93 A: they would have to make it so that there weren't any incidents and but there's you know incidents where people get guns on you know just to test the system or knives or i mean 

425.52 426.25 B: (( [mn] )) 

429.23 434.00 A: that's more important than you know somebody having nail clippers [laughter] 

433.38 436.03 B: [noise] right exactly exactly the 

435.64 441.30 A: and if they can if they can catch the nail clippers why can't [laughter] they catch the guns or the knives 

440.71 443.19 B: guns and the knives right 

442.09 444.33 A: that's what i worry about 

444.56 452.23 B: yeah and then with the war going on i would say that i would my my security level would probably more heightened now 

452.26 454.86 B: because they're gonna retaliate i'm sure 

454.40 455.44 A: uh-huh 

455.44 457.60 B: we don't know when we don't know where 

457.97 462.99 B: but [sigh] i don't know maybe they're focusing on the airports and that's not where they're gonna go 

463.54 470.80 B: maybe they're you know they'll do something different but it it still it still remains clear that they did it once and they can do it again 

470.51 471.68 A: mhm 

472.06 478.01 A: that's what i'm worried about [mn] 'cause they'll go to the one place that we aren't covering [laughter] 

477.23 478.58 B: exactly 

478.25 484.06 A: and so we need to either cover everything or there's no way we can protect ourselves 

487.75 488.77 B: okay 

488.96 494.72 B: um yeah i guess we really don't have a whole lot to say about it because [laughter] neither one of us fly too much 

494.29 496.20 A: mm no but i mean 

496.69 500.89 A: we most you know we both agree that we're not gonna fly [laughter] 

500.29 501.55 B: exactly 

500.93 503.22 A: because of you know it makes it 

503.25 512.43 A: more likely we're not going to fly because of the security risks and the [sigh] what they you know put into place we don't really feel that 

512.72 522.00 A: is you know catching everything and so it's just an inconvenience for the ones who don't need to be inconvenienced and the ones who are dangerous get through [laughter] 

521.74 524.37 B: mm exactly [noise] 

523.57 525.58 A: so i mean 

525.79 529.91 A: that's certain things that they would need to think about [laughter] 

531.00 536.65 B: yeah and like you said those checkpoints they should have checkpoints where you could meet in the middle somewhere [sigh] 

536.83 539.61 B: [lipsmack] and then you'd have to go back through 

540.24 552.71 B: you know the people that are going back into the airport or or so the the parts of the airport that are going back on to the plane would have to be checked again but i think that they should have a middle point where you can come out 

552.53 561.74 B: not so much out of the airport but out of the terminal just so that you can see someone that you may be looking for or for layovers they should have a a medium point for layovers 

561.78 575.16 A: yeah i mean they could do something as simple as um 'cause i knew my niece's name i knew the flight number i knew the gate she was supposed to be at so if i had all that information then go ahead and search me 

575.03 582.11 A: make sure i don't have anything i was fine with that i thought for sure they'd do that and then let me go back 

575.29 576.27 B: right 

577.03 578.17 B: exactly 

581.86 583.20 B: mhm 

582.52 589.38 A: because they- they've already searched me and i knew who i was gonna meet so it's not like a random person just wanting to go through 

589.50 595.41 A: and even you know if you have to leave your driver's license or if you have to leave some sort of um 

595.26 596.45 B: i._d. 

595.57 599.90 A: collateral yeah with them then you know whenever i get through seeing her then 

596.56 597.94 B: (( right [noise] ))
