402.48 413.68 B: and it's like it's affected so many people but if you don't know a person there then i don't know if it actually can affect you in any way you know 

402.65 403.38 A: (( oh )) 

409.15 410.08 A: mhm 

413.36 427.51 A: well it's affected i- it affects us in like small little ways uh like you know we don't think about it but it actually does like what with the um you know with the job situation and um and more people are going to school or going back to school now because it's hard that um 

422.31 423.61 B: yeah 

426.23 428.09 B: oh yeah 

427.35 440.86 A: because uh because no one can find a job so they're like well i might as well just go back to school and so a lot of people are going back to school i have a lot of friends that that are graduating but are just going to go to graduate school and it's just like 'cause you can't find a job out there so you're like i'll just go back so 

440.43 448.51 B: exactly yeah like um i actually take uh night classes at community college and there's been so many more like 

442.31 443.06 A: (( huh )) 

448.50 456.42 B: older and older you know percentage of people that their response was like at the beginning of the year why did you come back to school everyone like 

456.43 467.69 B: oh because i'm not finding like any job in my field or i got laid off or something happened you know and it's just man this just sucks it sucks ass [laughter] 

461.66 462.68 A: mhm 

466.47 475.60 A: yeah you'll find like i mean even in community but in community college you'll find older people in there anywhere and after work or but yeah i i'm doing the same thing i just i just have this crappy 

475.60 489.32 A: administrative secretary job that i have a degree but it's hard to do anything 'cause especially what i'm doing 'cause i i wanna be in the entertainment industry and and um the music industry and and the and like writing and stuff like that and it's really difficult because 

481.00 482.53 B: yeah 

489.08 496.14 A: um people are getting laid off in the in the next l- like western ride because people don't wanna go out and be entertained anymore 'cause they don't have enough money to do that 

496.10 509.25 A: and so i that's that's a loss for me so that's you know that's just and i wanna move to new york and everyone's like oh new york's n- dangerous now whatever but i wanna move to move to new york because that's that's where all the um media is and that's what i wanna do so

504.67 506.25 B: well [laughter] 

508.46 509.23 B: so 

509.27 511.70 B: so do you think we should actually just 

511.74 515.91 B: because there's two types of people now there's like those who 

516.01 527.63 B: give everything into it like give all their interest into the whole topic and the subject and there's others that live subconsciously and don't even care about the whole situation i mean i don't know which [noise] 

527.91 539.48 B: way to go towards like 'cause at times i'm like man look at all this that's affecting us and on the other hand it's like shouldn't we just live our lives the way that we lived 'em before 

539.56 540.96 B: (( you know it's it's )) 

539.62 549.83 A: yeah we should but we c- we we can but at the same time it's like uh like some some things that we just can't do any more or like it's hard to do i remember when i was sitting i was sitting waiting for the um 

549.60 562.42 A: one of the the buses to go around campus and this dumb sorority girl was like um i don't understand what went on with this i mean it's not like its affecting me any so i don't care about it and it's like well girl it affects all of us as americans 

560.53 574.15 B: that's exactly exactly what i was like because i went to the salon the other day and there's this uh woman talking about um the whole situation about iraq which is somewhat related to you know nine eleven terrorists 

573.30 574.14 A: uh-huh 

574.08 586.03 B: t- you know terrorism and and the whole link into iraq i don't even know how it's linked together i mean i don't even believe bush whenever he says it's linked together but it's anyways [laughter] but um 

583.19 584.27 A: uh-huh 

585.87 596.62 B: uh yeah she just goes yeah i don't care i i may as well if i'm gonna die i'm gonna die those soldiers aren't helping me so i don't really care and duh duh duh duh you know it's just
