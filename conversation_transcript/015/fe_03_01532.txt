95.19 99.92 B: is the baseball [noise] that seems to strike man almost 

99.53 105.02 A: i really don't actually i think i think um i think there are various ones that do 

100.78 102.61 B: every year i guess [laughter] 

105.30 108.64 A: i just don't know how i wonder how they get 

108.94 115.65 A: you know they choose to do it i mean is it does it have to be by group or by team or just by the association 

111.50 113.44 B: (( [noise] that's right )) 

115.72 116.76 B: oh 

116.88 119.57 B: see i i don't know enough about the top- 

119.81 121.69 B: you know sports to even 

122.66 124.04 A: [laughter] 

125.06 130.82 A: i hope they don't mind if we don't know anything about it [laughter] [laughter] well we're trying 

125.30 126.57 B: talk about it 

128.58 135.01 B: [laughter] i know they make a lot of money [laughter] 

131.25 136.29 A: (( but i know they make so darn much money no kidding [laughter] )) 

136.35 139.77 A: my vote is we need they need to share that with the rest of us 

138.96 145.37 B: that's right that's right that's right yeah [laughter] 

139.87 141.99 A: [laughter] 

142.42 146.39 A: that would be great [laughter] i could use a couple of bucks 

146.22 149.36 B: yeah well i you know and they 

150.35 154.34 B: i i just and they don't play all that much to really get paid 

154.78 160.53 B: a lot of money i mean the i mean the football and basketball players 

155.99 157.20 A: i know 

160.30 165.27 A: and then they pull these silly stunts that get in the news you know 

162.96 166.36 B: [noise] yeah yeah 

165.94 168.45 A: spend all their money on nice cars and nice houses 

168.17 169.49 B: yeah i it's 

168.71 169.28 A: (( i )) 

170.28 174.50 B: a lot of money mm [noise] yeah and 

174.92 181.07 B: well you know i guess i don't know if i was in the same position i don't mm 

183.23 186.21 A: mean they have to have some sort of reasoning behind it 

184.02 188.32 B: they must feel yeah the players must feel that 

189.03 194.37 B: you know they play well enough to deserve more money than what they're already getting 

194.60 195.77 B: but 

195.74 198.22 A: and they probably compare themselves to the others 

198.33 201.10 A: and what they make because it's always 

199.18 200.91 B: mhm sure 

201.25 204.67 A: it's always so out there in the public and the news what they make 

204.04 206.01 B: right right 

206.02 209.02 A: and then everyone wants more and they get kinda greedy about it 

209.24 210.27 A: [laughter] 

209.40 210.96 B: yeah 

211.00 212.07 B: well i guess 

212.42 218.21 B: [noise] the more money you make probably the more debt you go in so the more money you need [laughter] 

217.85 224.00 A: (( yeah that's true that's very true [laughter] it doesn't matter if it's a couple of hundred or a couple of million )) 

218.50 229.15 B: [laughter] [laughter] maybe that's what's going on with it you know all those players are just so far in debt they need more money i don't know [laughter] 

228.30 229.73 A: [laughter] 

230.01 234.00 B: [noise] i should let my husband talk on this spor- on this topic
