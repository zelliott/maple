0.00 1.94 B: hi my name's lisa 

1.35 3.12 A: hi my name is bea 

3.38 4.53 A: [laughter] how are you 

4.38 6.47 B: pretty good how are you today 

5.00 6.92 A: that's good fine 

7.17 9.37 B: so we're to discuss 

9.69 13.03 B: (( baseball salaries and strikes )) 

12.78 15.00 A: (( um baseball uh professional athletes )) 

15.59 17.40 A: should they strike 

17.07 25.28 B: yeah um i don't i don't know it seems to hurt in the long run the whole you know 

25.90 30.93 B: major league baseball and then they just charge more for tickets afterwards 

30.24 41.34 A: [laughter] well that's that's true i but the only reason i think they might just strike if they don't get paid enough because i figure like twenty years of work time for the average 

41.95 53.46 A: person wouldn't affect their body like it would an athlete that's the only reason i think they might need a little bit more money just because te- ten years out of their life is like [laughter] a lot of years 

48.79 50.50 B: yeah more money but 

53.69 55.95 A: (( even though they do get paid big bucks though )) 

53.76 54.52 B: but 

55.27 61.39 B: yeah some of 'em get paid a huge amount i would never earn in my lifetime what they made in like two or three years 

56.43 57.98 A: (( mhm goodness )) 

59.46 60.60 A: no 

60.91 63.83 A: and that is a lot of money but there is some of them are greedy 

63.95 65.98 A: they are very greedy 

65.04 72.06 B: and it i don't think the strikes are really helping like the little guys unless they could like have the minor leagues you know 

71.08 73.54 A: well it's not because you know 

72.58 75.09 B: benefit from some of it 

75.60 76.84 A: [noise] 

75.90 84.84 B: and it i think that a lot of the trickle down effect like all the little you know coffee shops and restaurants around the stadium they really suffer during a 

77.60 78.31 A: (( so )) 

84.18 87.29 A: that's true they suffer because they don't get no business 

86.65 87.80 B: (( yep )) 

87.48 91.83 A: and that's a family that's not making probably making their mortgage 

91.71 94.23 B: yeah [laughter] 

92.36 96.43 A: (( [laughter] you know but in two or three or four weeks however long they're on strike )) 

95.82 99.02 B: yeah it's the daily grind for them you know 

98.86 104.04 A: yeah it'll be trickled down to everybody if you go to the game you know [noise] 

103.81 107.92 B: yep everything costs more the prices are just getting outrageous 

108.60 113.27 A: that's true well i don't in a way i don't think they should strike 

113.21 119.20 B: yeah that's a i think more of that you know just one on one negotiation with each 

118.88 120.22 A: that's true but then 

119.36 126.59 B: member would you know be better for the i think the overall good of baseball 

126.06 130.78 A: yeah that's yeah and then you'll find it's the ones that's paid a lot of money that wanna 

131.01 132.73 A: that'll be hollering the most 

132.26 135.38 B: yeah yeah that's true 

134.96 141.35 A: yes you'll never find the little man who are hollering 'cause there's some underpaid players but they just happy to be playing 

141.07 149.27 B: yep but yeah so i i just really don't agree you know and i think it's especially noticeable with baseball because i 

150.32 162.11 B: you know there's no such thing as the minor league football that i know of and so i you know everybody that i know has turned from the major baseball games and they just got to the minor games now 

154.47 155.47 A: yeah 

159.49 160.40 A: (( yeah )) 

161.14 163.10 A: arena football that's 

163.17 168.44 A: the only kind of second football they have they play it in an arena they don't play outside at all 

168.24 169.41 B: (( ah )) 

169.31 175.68 A: they should be hollering about raises because they don't get they don't get paid nothing hardly nothing at all they 

171.32 174.46 B: yeah [laughter] 

175.51 176.71 B: (( yeah )) 

176.01 177.24 A: (( play a._a._a. )) 

177.35 178.88 A: the baseball team 

178.98 192.14 B: yeah that's 'cause and those people really suffer you know just their hopes and dreams of wanting to play in the major leagues and they really put up with you know living on a bus for six to eight months a year 

189.27 190.71 A: oh yes 

191.52 195.25 A: (( they they need it they the ones that need a pay raise )) 

192.87 193.89 B: and 

194.63 200.19 B: yeah they need the money but they don't go strike because they don't wanna dash their hopes of 

199.07 201.87 A: [laughter] that's true 

201.58 203.19 B: playing in the big 

203.59 205.85 B: big leagues 

205.41 206.50 A: (( [noise] that's true )) 

206.67 209.87 B: yeah and i i think that most people that i know 

210.36 211.67 B: with um 

211.22 211.82 A: (( [noise] )) 

212.05 217.34 B: the last strike are just like totally turned off baseball nobody's really interested and then they also 

216.08 222.25 A: no because i know our stadium was empty and usually is well it used to be kinda kinda full gundarena 

222.17 223.32 B: (( ah )) 

223.53 227.65 A: or should i say no jacob's field that's what it is i don't go 

225.71 227.05 B: yeah 

227.65 231.06 B: yeah it's in cleveland it's the jacob field new 

230.09 230.96 A: yes 

231.12 236.64 A: and it used to be full but this past since they've been playing no one gonna probably show up 

236.40 246.61 B: yeah i think the statistics for cleveland when it was first opened everybody wanted to go just to try out the stadium but it wasn't to see the ball game it was more to see the stadium itself 

241.69 243.02 A: mhm 

245.88 252.62 A: and they hadn't really played a good game in a long time not since mark mike hargrove was the uh 

253.13 254.82 A: coach of the team uh 

255.07 260.51 A: you know the manager of the team now don't nobody don't hardly know none of the players 'cause all of them have gone 

260.04 262.06 B: oh yeah that's true 

262.56 266.76 A: well nobody hardly know the players if they lose my gonna go to the 

267.19 268.55 A: to the little person 

268.28 279.78 B: and also then with the stadium building is all you know did the taxes go up in your area i know in the pittsburgh that allegany county has a higher sales tax in order to help 

279.86 285.89 A: oh yes they talked about raising our taxes but uh [noise] we'll vote for 'em on the fifteenth the fifteenth of of may 

286.05 288.57 A: um we have a vote but i don't think they wanna 

288.78 291.00 A: (( i don't think the people gonna pass this tax )) 

290.74 293.26 B: yeah they did it in pittsburgh and 

293.42 297.13 A: because they wanna raise your house tax and 

296.93 298.18 B: oh my 

297.50 299.54 A: taxes on your house and new [noise] 

299.31 308.02 B: yeah they just did the sales tax in pittsburgh so you know like if you go into buy a t._v. the tax is seven percent whereas the rest of 

308.07 312.74 B: you know outside that county it's six percent state sales tax 

312.00 313.87 A: i think they need to tax the 

313.91 318.62 A: the major league [laughter] the games will be more money 

315.15 317.10 B: yeah [laughter] 

317.99 325.20 B: and then and now even there's less games on t._v. because they're selling 'em to the you know the cable channels 

322.92 328.13 A: cable channels yes and not everybody subscribe to the cable and that's bad 

327.52 328.91 B: (( yep )) 

328.23 333.21 A: but my tax dollars go to help pay for the stadium but i can't watch it on television 

333.03 337.46 B: yep and and they had to do it because financially they needed the 

337.66 338.79 A: the money 

337.69 341.05 B: the the money to pay those salaries 

338.92 339.92 A: yeah 

340.64 344.01 A: they get they get greedier greedier and greedier and 

343.48 344.49 B: yep 

344.03 346.02 A: you wonder where it's gonna stop 

345.04 351.41 B: yeah [laughter] so that's yeah so that's why i think the you know the strikes are really hurting 

346.54 347.42 A: (( you know )) 

347.58 348.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

351.55 354.99 A: it is it do hurt hurt a lot of people when they do that 

353.76 363.26 B: and it it really brings to the attention of people just how much some of those guys are getting paid and yeah you can see that they should maybe you know earn 

363.14 371.06 B: two or three times the amount of the average person because their careers are only you know a third or half as long but 

367.59 368.73 A: right 

370.01 372.78 A: but not in no millions and millions of dollars that's what 

371.95 374.77 B: yeah millions of dollars of year 

372.89 374.19 A: (( that's ridiculous )) 

374.46 384.48 A: that's ridiculous i can understand endorsements yeah but not just from playing the sport alone they shouldn't earn no millions of dollars they should there should be a cap on on that it really should 

383.23 396.31 B: yeah yeah that would be good a cap on salaries and try you know then they could have some leverage to keep the strikes from happening and saying hey look yeah well you know here's the lower paid guys we'll up there but 

390.11 391.50 A: mhm 

396.03 397.51 A: [laughter] 

396.64 400.69 B: you top guys will just have to suffer with your millions 

398.47 399.70 A: (( suffer right )) 

399.80 403.25 A: because this ridiculous two million dollars for a season or 

403.35 404.93 A: six years or 

404.72 406.07 B: yeah 

405.13 409.00 A: (( three years and i don't know that's that's too much money )) 

409.10 417.54 B: yep and then they just think of a reason a couple of years later to they want more than you know what they got out of the last strike 

418.00 421.94 A: i don't know it seems like the more they get the more they want exactly 

421.09 429.42 B: yep 'cause it works you know for them they go on strike they get their like little crying babies having a temper fit 

428.68 429.42 A: (( mhm )) 

429.46 431.71 A: i wish i could could uh 

431.92 433.47 A: make what they make 

432.84 434.40 B: (( yeah )) 

433.63 436.49 A: i wouldn't want never wanna go on no strike and probably 

436.68 443.71 A: cuss out somebody that's talking about going on strike you know we're going on strike we've got enough money to survive in this world 

440.03 442.84 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

443.12 449.14 B: [laughter] that's right no no don't tell anybody what we've got they'll want some of it [laughter] 

443.72 444.71 A: no 

447.77 457.24 A: yes we make enough they make enough money to survive in this world and then some to support families the money these uh baseball and basketball players make 

457.22 458.25 B: yep 

457.95 461.19 A: but no they get it as tax write off though 

461.90 464.70 A: uh-huh and they give a lot of it to charities that they know 

465.14 467.35 B: oh yeah it makes them you know just 

465.17 465.98 A: (( have )) 

467.04 468.95 A: to pay less in taxes 

468.34 469.44 B: yep 

469.50 473.26 B: they get a tax break on it it makes them look good and 

471.18 472.85 A: (( mhm )) 

473.46 474.75 A: yeah 

475.05 477.65 A: they're still doing better than not- nobody else 

477.36 486.11 B: yeah so i really think that the strikes are you know just bad for baseball in particular and bad for most of the other sport 

484.53 489.33 A: it is and the small people that's working the stadiums they is because they got a job 

489.44 496.58 A: the hotdog vendors and the cap sellers tee shirts and they make a living some of 'em make a living off off that um 

496.29 497.60 B: yep 

496.63 499.07 A: (( off selling selling what they sell )) 

498.89 500.09 B: uh-huh 

500.11 502.10 A: doing this doing that season [noise] 

502.77 514.45 B: yep and i know a lot of you know like in pittsburgh the college kids they get a job for the summer you know being one of the hotdog vendors in the stadium itself that's how they're supporting themselves to go through college 

514.02 516.66 A: mm yes this it's seasonal uh 

516.18 517.16 B: yep 

517.06 518.05 A: work 

517.76 522.75 B: and seasonal jobs are getting you know harder to find so that's just another 

522.51 524.20 A: (( well yes there's lots of )) 

523.62 526.52 B: bad point of that 

525.70 532.02 A: i think they they're going to be crying in a minute because there's no one going to be going to hardly no games in a while they're really gonna be crying 

529.66 531.67 B: yeah [laughter] 

532.54 533.70 B: yep 

533.83 536.03 A: things are about to get very bad 

535.82 543.13 B: but then there's you know some corporations buy those season tickets and you know i'm sure that'll keep up that 

542.52 545.33 A: (( oh yeah and they bought up loads of boxes )) 

544.71 546.17 B: yeah 

545.44 548.39 A: that's over a hundred thousand dollars for that little bitty 

548.34 549.42 B: yeah 

548.66 556.22 A: box the only thing they get in those boxes is uh what like waitressing they get somebody to come up there to serve them 

555.94 557.07 B: yep 

557.56 563.60 B: yeah it's like you know uh having a dining room in a hotel you know up in your room 

560.92 562.61 A: mhm 

563.93 565.44 A: (( that's so true )) 

564.01 568.31 B: and you know you hav- there's a waitress assigned to it or waiter and 

568.90 575.99 A: i used to go see the games but i stopped going to them 'cause tickets cost too much when they went up i mean to go to jacobs field uh-uh 

572.38 574.13 B: yeah that's 

577.23 582.65 B: we we just go to the college ball games now [laughter] 

579.92 585.87 A: [laughter] well yeah that'd be better 'cause their tickets are just ridiculous tickets ridiculous 

585.27 589.63 B: yep i i'd much rather pay two bucks [laughter] 

588.31 592.28 A: (( yeah [laughter] me too [noise] if )) 

592.47 595.17 B: yeah and be able to see the whole and i 

593.99 594.79 A: i 

595.97 599.00 A: (( could just pay uh-uh that's too much money )) 

598.82 599.95 B: (( think ))
