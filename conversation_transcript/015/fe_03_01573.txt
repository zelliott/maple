31.42 33.94 A: the money that they do yeah 

33.19 36.48 B: and i don't because i think they're glorifying 'em but 

36.39 48.53 B: you know i guess that they take a ch- when they take a chance that they only play for like four or five years a lotta time so they have to make their fortune in that four or five year time so it's kind of a mixed mixed gender of 

48.37 57.21 B: of decision whether it's [laughter] whether it's right or wrong you know they it's something the public will pay for so as long as the public will pay for it well they're gonna be able to get it

84.12 85.86 A: you know i mean look at what 

88.54 102.94 A: well and that's yeah exactly right i mean some of those people uh do pretty tacky things and to think that that is supposed to be somebody that the kids look up to to me is i think that they oughta have stricter laws on that you know

116.38 118.09 A: how 'bout that 

117.28 126.29 B: a mixed of mixed opinions here anyway i'm watching the district and it's uh it's a story about a a hot shot fighter that comes into washington d._c. and all the havoc that they 

119.28 120.23 A: [laughter] 

126.11 138.29 B: he's causing and bringing in all the mobsters for the big fight and you know all this and it's the ever typical yeah it's a very typical thing you know i mean these fighters a lot of this i think the fighting industry 

129.42 132.98 A: oh well there you go see that's part of what we're supposed to be talking about 

134.13 135.10 A: yep 

138.06 144.62 B: is probably the one you hear the most about being crooked you know i'm sure the other ones have things happen that we don't ever hear about 

142.97 147.08 A: oh yeah i'm sure they all do all today there's just so many things that are crooked 

145.05 146.46 B: but you know 

146.66 154.48 B: yeah but the fighting industry you always hear about one of the fighters getting into some kinda trouble or getting killed because somebody's doing something or 

152.44 153.65 A: right 

154.25 162.46 B: you know and y- i really i strongly believe that about three or four of the fights that they do are thrown or set up anyway so but they still make 

160.24 164.17 A: exactly and i always figured they were connected to the mob or something you know 

163.22 167.12 B: (( yeah right right and they still make a small fortune )) 

164.60 166.39 A: (( it's their way to launder money )) 

166.77 167.85 A: yeah 

167.25 173.09 B: i mean they make a lot of money you know hundreds of do- i mean millions of dollars sometimes 

168.91 169.86 A: yep 

172.39 181.17 A: well i mean you know like when they've had the baseball strikes and whatever you know i mean people really look forward to that stuff not tha- that it should be 

175.65 177.22 B: (( [cough] right )) 

180.91 181.84 B: yeah 

181.20 186.76 A: your life but unfortunately for some people it is and i can't judge everybody else but 

182.11 183.05 B: yep 

183.78 185.35 B: it is right 

185.44 190.83 B: well and people that are in isolated you know they're the older people that can't get out and do things you know 

188.90 194.76 A: right and enjoy it yeah and you know and then they make the tick- tickets so expensive and 

191.18 192.04 B: (( yeah )) 

194.00 194.85 B: (( right )) 

195.33 200.61 A: you know and then they ahead and decide well they didn't give me enough money so let's strike you know 

195.91 196.50 B: (( mm )) 

199.58 201.84 B: yeah let's strike you know it's just 

200.85 203.04 A: and it's like okay 

202.29 214.28 B: yeah yeah [laughter] well it's kinda like you know the military isn't allowed to strike and sometimes i think that the sporting industry should be that way too that they shouldn't be allowed to strike 'cause it's the public that's supporting 'em you know and so 

213.17 219.69 A: well yeah 'cause it's nothing but entertainment i mean it really is it's entertainment just a different kind of entertainment 

215.19 216.89 B: right right 

217.06 217.96 B: right 

218.87 220.66 B: right yeah well it 

220.97 225.08 A: i don't know i just i just think that they get paid too much for what they are 

221.89 222.89 B: (( [cough] )) 

224.65 227.89 B: yep i think so too 'cause like you say they're just humans 

225.19 227.29 A: and and 

227.48 231.80 A: right and exac- the they want that one guy that was the bulls 

232.16 235.44 A: oh i can't even remember what his name is he was so disgusting 

235.53 238.61 A: the one with the blonde hair that black guy with the blonde hair 

238.04 242.99 B: oh i kn- yeah oh what is his name i can't think of his name either 

238.73 241.33 A: that always got dressed up so weird 

241.86 244.48 A: i don't know but i mean i'm thinking 

243.23 248.42 B: well you never knew whether he was gonna have blonde hair or black hair or red hair or orange hair or 

246.46 257.52 A: [laughter] exactly or pink [laughter] and i'm thinking okay and then there's kids that have got t. shirts on they're looking up this guy i mean that's one thing i will have to say for michael jordan 

249.00 251.35 B: yeah whatever whatever he was 

254.66 255.62 B: right 

257.63 263.31 A: yes he's made millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars but at least the man 

258.04 258.84 B: right 

261.28 262.24 B: uh-huh 

263.40 265.43 A: unless we don't know about it 

265.05 267.05 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

266.08 271.33 A: on the surface you know he appears to be a good role model at least for the kids 

269.93 272.16 B: right yeah right 

271.40 272.36 A: you know 

272.32 284.01 B: that's true very true but yeah i i it it is sad it's a sad situation because the kids so many of the kids don't have parents that are really active in discussing whether it's a good or a bad role model and they just kinda 

282.78 286.95 A: oh tell me i [mn] was in the school system for twenty three years 

284.25 285.64 B: kinda just 

286.39 294.15 B: oh god they just kinda take you know take what they have on the surface and go with it and that's not always the best thing to do so 

287.11 288.16 A: [laughter] 

293.32 308.03 A: that's right well and i think those people just like that one guy whatever his name is you know they tend to have fads that kinda after the way they do things you know so then people start dressing in those baggy pants and 

294.63 295.55 B: (( there you go )) 

298.83 300.52 B: (( i can't understand )) 

303.73 304.80 B: right 

307.46 309.09 B: oh and i hate 'em 

308.66 311.56 A: oh there we go [laughter] i know 

309.51 321.77 B: just hate 'em i have a sixteen year old grandson well he's almost sixteen todd and he sometimes i'd like to just take him and strip him down bare just to get on clothes that are decent child 

317.73 319.03 A: (( i know )) 

319.58 321.02 A: [laughter] 

321.18 327.99 A: yeah my son's twenty three but he was doing that too he wasn't quite as bad as some of 'em because he got in in the front part of it 

321.98 322.96 B: (( [cough] )) 

327.79 328.80 B: yeah 

328.36 337.31 A: but um it w- no i just i d- you know i [laughter] i wanted him to dress like i did when i was at school you know [laughter] 

329.22 330.18 B: (( yeah )) 

335.58 341.04 B: right right and they don't do that they just don't do that unfortunately yeah 

337.42 338.88 A: no 

339.21 343.59 A: no i don't think that's probably gonna ever get that you know that way ever again 

341.61 342.56 B: no 

342.70 349.62 B: no no we were it's just one of them things that we are everybody has their own their own style i think 

345.71 347.02 A: well i think 

349.05 354.98 A: exactly well i guess we just need to find out who we need to get a hold of these you know since we got all the answers for this 

350.30 351.05 B: (( mhm )) 

354.72 357.42 B: right right we should just call the 

355.81 358.67 A: and have 'em just change that because 

357.83 362.55 B: right and just tell 'em that you think that [laughter] they need to change their rules 

358.88 360.03 A: it's wrong 

361.19 365.14 A: because if women were running everything things [laughter] would run a lot better 

363.79 370.30 B: god wouldn't it be though but i don't think they've really had too many strikes where they've struck you know struck the 

370.31 372.68 B: athletes have s- gone on struck but 

371.90 373.72 A: no just baseball i think 

373.00 374.75 B: every n- yeah every 

373.78 376.97 A: i don't remember anything other than baseball do you know 

375.45 378.07 B: yeah the baseball and and uh 

378.17 380.11 B: you know i know that like the 

380.12 381.94 B: act- the actors 

381.35 384.67 A: right the actors have done it the actors have done it before 

381.84 389.16 B: you know they've gone on strike and and you know they do that kind of on a regular basis but then they usually don't last too long but 

388.94 397.41 B: i guess like you say i think the the baseball is the only one that's really actually gone on strike and of course they went on strike if i remember rightly right at the 

397.45 399.10 A: right at the beginning of the season 

397.82 401.21 B: at the yeah right [sigh] right when they were 

400.09 404.89 A: and so all the men were really crabby [laughter] 

401.94 405.95 B: right right right when everybody was really unhappy so 

405.02 406.82 A: oh definitely 

405.97 411.88 B: it makes it you know they they got definitely got you over a barrel without any doubt they definitely 

409.03 410.46 A: that's for sure 

410.88 412.78 A: that's for sure so i 

411.95 413.10 B: yep 

412.80 417.02 A: i i don't know what else to say about it other than that i think its wrong you know
