1.66 3.49 B: hello hi i 

3.01 10.72 A: [sigh] well this is kind of a weird con- uh discussion how do we feel about professional athletes striking 

11.22 13.27 B: know [sigh] well i'm sorry what's your name 

13.15 14.37 A: [cough] i'm linda 

14.06 17.42 B: hi linda i'm michele and where are you calling from or getting a call from

19.66 26.10 B: oh well i'm the opposite end of this border or this side of the you know united states i'm in san diego 

26.07 30.30 A: oh really [laughter] we have some good friends that down there in la melinda 

26.72 28.35 B: yeah so 

30.18 33.11 B: ah yeah i'm almost to the border i could you know 

31.17 31.81 A: (( so )) 

32.76 38.55 A: oh wow [laughter] well that's funny that's funny [sigh] was it nice there today 

33.25 35.68 B: almost run to the border well not quite that 

39.01 41.39 B: um it was fairly nice um 

41.67 46.14 B: it was a little too hot for me but that's you know because i'm originally from denver 

43.80 46.33 A: uh it was sunny and gorgeous here 

46.29 48.76 B: but that's 'cause i'm originally from denver so 

48.19 52.55 A: oh yeah my uh oldest son lives in denver right now in uh 

51.32 52.60 B: oh what part 

52.64 55.18 A: uh longmont just north of town 

54.96 57.38 B: yep um i'm from broomfield [lipsmack] 

57.58 59.77 B: so that's about forty five minutes from me 

57.62 58.39 A: oh 

59.96 61.64 A: yeah not bad 

60.38 62.27 B: [lipsmack] yeah near boulder yeah [sigh] 

62.42 66.94 A: [lipsmack] well tell me what do you think about strikes for professional athletes 

66.65 70.81 B: i didn't personally know there was one [laughter] 

68.96 70.62 A: [laughter] 

70.76 77.04 A: well i think like two years ago the baseball players had that huge strike 

70.92 73.47 B: but i i certainly don't think they des- 

74.88 75.85 B: yeah 

76.57 83.59 B: i well i'm i remember that but i did- i thought they were and like i didn't know there was any currently going on or potential ones 

82.08 85.72 A: yeah i'm not aware of any currently going on but 

84.84 89.42 B: i know i know they don't deserve um the money that they make [laughter] [mn] 

88.72 91.06 A: i don't think anybody should make 

91.30 96.27 A: fourteen million dollars in a year or whatever because there's only about [lipsmack] 

96.44 109.29 A: i don't know two three dozen of them that make these outrageous amounts and then half the other people on the team make you know semi reasonable like i don't know three hundred thousand dollars whatever which is already outrageous but 

109.22 111.81 A: at least it's a little more reasonable [laughter] 

111.52 116.08 B: [mn] well i know i mean and and then they complain well i only made fourteen million dollars last year 

115.90 118.65 A: i know and i need to go on strike 

116.39 125.24 B: [laughter] and i think that is s- okay i made about you know a hundredth of that or someth- i mean i don't know [laughter] i'm just guessing but you know 

122.19 123.73 A: yeah no kidding 

125.39 127.89 B: it's like and i live just fine [laughter] 

127.48 134.61 A: yeah i i think it's ludicrous how much um they have paid the professional 

134.89 142.12 A: uh sports people across the board even the best paid ones i don't believe should be paid any more than 

142.16 145.59 A: i don't know three hundred four hundred thousand at the tops 

145.61 148.31 B: well i mean yeah they have a uh 

146.00 146.69 A: i 

148.56 151.73 B: special talent but you know i don't think it's any m- 

150.77 162.57 A: yeah they do and it is a limited talent and they can only do it for so many years but frankly there's a lot of professions like that where you can only do it for a you know a set number of years 

155.25 157.69 B: yeah so i mean they should be able to make yeah 

162.50 172.80 B: oh yeah no doubt well it it's like the military i mean they don't make fourteen million dollars a year and they you know can't do it till they're sixty five or most people can't do it till they're sixty five i mean [mn] 

169.60 171.40 A: oh i know [laughter] 

172.89 176.84 A: well and i think if they didn't make as much money um 

176.83 181.07 A: the cost of the tickets and whatever would be a whole lot more reasonable 

180.98 193.45 A: and in theory i i don't know we aren't into professional sports my husband isn't either much so i don't have a clue how much it really costs to go to games anymore but i know whenever we've thought about going 

186.28 187.54 B: yeah oh neither are [noise] 

193.39 202.21 A: we've always looked at the prices like uh portland trailblazers here and said [mn] i'm not gonna pay forty dollars for a seat you know 

201.18 205.91 B: yeah i don't i don't know either i'm i'm in the same boat we're not into sports and don't really go 

205.99 210.35 B: but i know oh shoot um ten ten years ago or more 

210.45 211.46 B: um 

211.72 214.79 B: when the colorado rockies were coming in they were building a new 

214.95 224.53 B: stadium 'cause they were playing they used to play at mile high and then they were building 'em a sports field and we went to uh mile high and sat in what they call like the rock pile or something because my 

217.74 219.64 A: mhm mhm 

224.54 232.41 B: biological father had come to visit so he wanted to go see a game 'cause he's into sports and it was you know a couple of dollars a seat or something it was really inexpensive but 

225.09 226.71 A: yes yes 

232.43 236.54 B: you know they were really cruddy seats and that was the only way i would've gone you know 

236.00 244.66 A: [mn] we've been to downtown portland they have a i don't know a triple a. a quadruple a. whatever that it is for baseball uh 

244.73 257.13 A: top end farm team and the same thing they have a a fairly decent stadium it's just in town it's nothing huge but um one side of it has more like bleacher seats that 

257.16 259.73 A: uh largely face the west and so 

259.89 263.35 A: the games are in the evening and the sun is in your eyes but it's 

263.67 274.88 A: five dollars or less to go [laughter] and so we've gone down there a couple of times because we have five kids and and you know we've going to pay a whole lot to do something like that so 

270.09 271.86 B: (( [mn] yeah mhm )) 

274.76 278.82 B: well no doubt i mean i i i can't see you know 

279.17 289.98 B: i i can understand them wanting to you know provide for their family but i mean provide for their family on less than a hundred thousand dollars a year i mean depending on w- where you live i mean 

287.32 289.02 A: no kidding 

289.15 302.00 A: yeah well and c._e._o.s i mean there's a lot of c._e._o.s who are you know head of major corporations that are making in the three four i guess some of them may even be making five hundred thousand a year 

303.20 314.67 A: a- it seems like anybody making half a million or thereabouts is more than well endowed for whatever they need and if they need more than that then you're spending it on [laughter] the wrong things 

314.65 321.14 B: yeah well if they're gonna make fourteen million dollars they can only play for one year [laughter] 

315.22 316.05 A: so 

318.94 321.56 A: (( yeah there you go [laughter] i like that idea )) 

321.29 326.54 B: you're only allowed to play for one year if your uh your salary is over a million dollars you can play for one year 

326.26 330.03 A: yeah but where would michael jordan be [laughter] 

329.06 331.99 B: yeah no one would want to play sports then though [laughter] yeah 

331.39 333.74 A: yeah yeah that that would be true 

333.84 336.33 A: it seems like most of them play 

336.67 339.60 A: i'm thinking maybe ten fifteen years wouldn't you say 

340.52 341.98 A: i don't remember 

341.11 352.82 B: um [sigh] if we're just talking professionally if they go right out of college probably yeah because they're getting out of college you know at like twenty two if they go for four years and you know they're playing for like 

344.54 345.92 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

349.70 350.58 A: mhm 

351.28 354.88 A: it seems most of 'em by the time they're thirty five are 

355.32 364.58 A: kinda done and rarely do you find a professional athlete in their forties although they did a little cameo on one the other day on i 

364.69 367.01 A: think it was t._v. someplace about uh 

367.81 375.37 A: um some baseball player that was forty two and he was still doing really well and i was like oh okay huh 

376.22 381.33 B: yeah [sigh] i don't know i'm i don't really i hear a sports guy and i just change the channel 

381.88 382.82 A: [laughter] 

382.01 386.97 B: you know [laughter] i i don't not into sports at all i mean 

383.76 384.69 A: yeah 

387.65 392.37 A: we aren't either i was very fortunate and married a a nice man who's not either 

389.56 390.90 B: it it 

391.63 399.46 B: yeah we i think we all we watch is the superbowl every year my it's it's funny 'cause my sister she's um almost seventeen and um 

393.08 393.77 A: so 

398.09 398.73 A: (( mhm )) 

399.85 412.56 B: recently and i don't really know why but um she got had the opportunity to do a fashion show where the colorado avalanche the hockey team you know they escorted the ladies down the you know stand um 

410.37 411.96 A: [mn] oh uh-huh 

412.80 424.40 B: and she lives in colorado so i didn't get a chance to go see this but um it's just weird because she had like the newest and i wish i could remember the name of the the player but she had the newest avalanche walk her down the the aisle so i mean 

424.04 425.08 A: (( cool )) 

424.75 439.66 B: i thought that was kind of interesting but you know at least they're out there i think it was something put on by the wives that the wives arranged it you know or something something to do with the wives of the avalanche players and the children's hospital 'cause my sister has a lotta medical issues that she deals with i think 

426.47 427.49 A: yeah 

431.72 432.50 A: mhm 

439.73 442.21 B: you know that they're at least out there putting those 

439.78 440.63 A: uh-huh 

442.28 449.72 B: i was about to say those athletic people who are out there putting back into the community maybe they deserve to work you know for 

447.27 459.14 A: several of our uh trailblazers are but i think they're actually repenting for their uh drug convictions recently they've all been pulled over for marijuana bust this and uh 

459.22 466.97 A: marijuana bust that and drive your hummer into a ditch and uh several other things and so several of them have given 

467.28 472.33 A: chunks of money like two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the portland public schools because 

472.59 479.67 A: uh oregon is in such a horrible shape for schools we actually live in um vancouver washington 

480.02 484.36 A: so we don't have to deal with it but a number of our um 

485.01 493.10 A: trailblazers have set up community foundations or do boys club or you know something like that where they hold clinics and do 

493.50 500.54 A: a fair amount of goodwill stuff but even so i i don't think that buys fourteen million dollars [laughter] worth of whatever 

500.34 504.89 B: yeah i know i i think it's good obviously to put it all back into the community thought i mean 

504.53 506.82 A: yeah oh absolutely yes 

506.73 508.21 B: yeah but uh 

507.85 515.95 A: because i mean i know they have to stay in shape somewhat but they've got a half a year where technically they're not really working 

516.76 517.70 A: um 

516.92 520.08 B: yeah yeah at least three to six months they're not really working 

518.89 520.68 A: yeah 

520.70 525.99 A: so there's really no reason why they can't do something [sigh] like that 

524.99 525.77 B: (( well it's )) 

525.86 528.35 B: you know i mean they make enough money 

527.00 531.33 A: well i wonder how much more time we have to exhaust [laughter] 

529.69 530.66 B: i know 

530.81 535.83 B: i've done this is my third call now and i just you never know what to talk about [laughter] 

535.59 540.61 A: and by the time i'm about seven minutes or so into it um 

536.09 536.70 B: (( yeah )) 

540.69 548.68 A: it's like okay well we about exhausted that subject [laughter] this is the second or third one no this is the third one too that i've done i think 

544.49 545.59 B: (( but )) 

547.40 550.55 B: yeah my my first call was about a month ago 

550.59 560.90 B: and the topic was what we would change in our life or something you know very similar to that and so we were done in like two minutes 'cause neither one of us really wanted to change anything so we were like just talking about ourselves i mean 

555.36 556.07 A: oh 

557.03 558.21 A: [laughter] 

560.73 561.66 A: yeah 

560.86 569.03 B: then then my second call was like a couple of nights ago and it was about nine eleven so we had a lot to talk about i mean you know 

568.23 569.11 A: (( mm )) 

569.16 571.84 B: so it was just kinda you know now it's 

572.38 580.41 B: um you know with this call i mean [noise] i don't anything about sports so we're just kinda going around and around in circle [laughter] 

575.17 579.70 A: yeah i'm i'm about done with the sports thing here [laughter] 

579.71 587.72 A: i suppose well i don't know if they give you uh the topic just to keep you talking for ten minutes or if they wanna hear 

585.25 586.69 B: well i did ask but 

587.77 588.94 A: certain 

588.94 590.44 B: no i think they're just [mn] [noise] 

588.96 590.86 A: sound blends 

590.69 597.82 B: i think they're giving us a topic so we just don't sit there and you know not talk about thing or even if we don't have to talk about personal stuff too 

594.66 596.41 A: yeah maybe so 

597.73 598.79 A: right 

597.96 599.89 B: or only talk about personal stuff
