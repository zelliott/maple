202.43 208.26 B: take the cushion out and all this kind of stuff and and it's a hassle but you know 

209.16 212.28 B: you you could let something slip through that way

212.55 215.08 A: well i agree with you that uh 

215.27 220.36 A: we should have good security although it makes me dang mad that these 

217.41 218.09 B: yeah 

220.60 222.69 A: characters over there 

223.43 225.25 A: are causing this

227.78 229.38 A: yes they are 

228.92 229.79 B: (( yeah )) 

230.22 233.30 A: but i'll tell ya our press 

233.87 238.76 A: they sure give you a distorted idea of 

239.81 241.00 A: uh 

241.24 248.91 A: well of everything but particularly the airport security and the situation in iraq 

248.43 249.35 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

250.33 256.31 A: i am very much anti-media in that they seem to 

256.85 260.89 A: well [cough] if you'll pardon my french screw things up 

260.29 261.20 B: right 

261.88 265.66 B: ambulance chaser type things and uh 

263.97 264.96 A: yes 

266.41 271.42 B: i've i have been listening a lot to of to fox 

271.52 273.40 B: and uh they seem 

274.79 278.34 B: i guess they are pro-bush maybe that's 

278.45 288.30 B: i'm not sure that's what it is but they're trying to tell both sides of the issue they don't just do like so many of the others just 

288.73 295.07 B: you know it's we're just wasting our time we didn't have any business over there and all of that kind of stuff 

295.11 297.39 B: and anybody that 

297.45 306.98 B: thinks it's okay for somebody to send in a hu- human being through a shredder they need their head examined you know i think we need to go over there and get rid of him 

307.21 310.36 B: and everybody else that thinks like that 

311.74 313.99 A: well i have to agree with you 

314.12 316.86 A: i spent twenty years in the navy 

317.46 318.52 A: so 

318.65 320.60 A: [cough] i'm somewhat 

320.94 324.44 A: uh oriented toward our armed forces 

323.90 324.90 B: right 

325.10 327.21 A: and 

327.39 330.64 A: i can't understand why 

330.75 332.11 A: france 

332.16 335.23 A: and germany and russia 

335.38 340.08 A: were objecting to us going in there and getting rid of that character 

339.78 344.08 B: well i don't know either well yes i do they were making money 

344.41 345.77 A: there you go 

344.45 359.21 B: and you bet if they make money then they don't want to bother it but we've been having problems with france sin- at least since world war two because my dad fought in world war two and boy he didn't have anything good to say about the french 

359.26 370.74 A: well i did too i'm eighty two so [cough] you can probably see i was of the right age for that and the french have been 

366.19 368.13 B: right mhm 

371.59 374.19 A: oh kind of 

374.28 376.79 A: like a spoilt child 

376.29 377.13 B: (( yes )) 

377.90 383.01 A: although i have several good uh friends in france 

382.51 385.84 B: yeah my husband has some good friends over there 

385.88 393.86 B: and i heard this one guy saying that the problem with france is it's becoming a mu- another muslim nation 

394.16 397.34 B: and so you know they don't like americans 

397.63 399.91 B: they i don't know if a lot of 

400.35 412.46 B: uh muslims are moving in or if a lot of the population is turning to muslim the muslim religion or what's going on but he was saying it's gonna be another muslim nation in you know in a few years 

413.20 421.53 A: well i don't think that that's going to be france is pretty much a 

421.61 424.67 A: a roman catholic country 

423.88 425.02 B: mhm 

424.96 426.77 A: and 

427.54 434.60 A: at least of the native frenchmen i don't think you're gonna get too many muslims 

431.84 432.80 B: right 

434.12 440.16 B: well that's what i was saying they may be moving in and over running the place 

440.07 441.36 A: well 

441.62 443.78 A: speaking of moving in 

443.97 451.14 A: i saw figures the other day that there's about seven million muslims in this country 

451.03 452.08 B: yeah 

452.41 458.10 B: but then a lot of the nati- you know a lot of our people turned to that 

458.26 467.48 B: religion i mean some have come in but then we've got you know people that are just changing religion and go- and going to the muslim religion they see 

468.37 469.19 B: they 

468.68 471.09 A: well i don't know too many 

471.13 479.73 B: well the most famous one i know is moham- mohammed ali he's and then i've heard other people 

471.37 472.40 A: um 

479.72 486.65 B: just in conversation why it's a peace-loving religion so they they go to that 

486.90 491.00 B: and it may be a peace-loving religion but the people 

491.12 492.31 B: that are 

494.36 495.46 B: um 

497.01 498.47 B: well they don't 

498.48 500.94 B: stand behind it you know like 

500.95 505.88 B: they're over there fighting us right now and they inst- well they came over here and 

506.48 509.25 B: blew up two buildings and killed so many people 

509.67 514.28 B: well those guys were muslims and they're not practicing what they preach yeah 

513.98 521.06 A: well although you know we're christians or most of us are and uh 

521.30 529.15 A: uh we do the same things but i think that um the point is well taken 

529.16 532.77 A: that these people are not practicing their religion 

532.07 533.01 B: right 

533.85 534.78 B: and 

534.18 537.03 A: but i'm not worried about the 

538.04 540.60 A: uh my personal safety 

541.13 542.37 B: i'm not either 

542.47 549.63 A: i tell you i've lived long enough that if i go tomorrow i figure i've had a good run and that's it 

542.57 543.49 B: they could 

549.13 550.51 B: (( and yeah and you'd )) 

550.52 553.38 B: probably and be better off in the in the 

553.54 555.81 B: interim you know you'd just be better off if 

556.09 557.47 A: (( right )) 

556.88 561.15 B: in the end than you are gonna than you are on earth putting up with those guys 

561.47 564.66 B: i don't believe you're gonna have to deal with them if you go to heaven 

565.80 570.92 A: well since i don't believe in either heaven or hell 

570.32 572.93 B: [laughter] well 

572.23 573.74 A: i guess i 

573.84 576.01 A: i'm worried about now 

575.77 576.64 B: yeah 

578.34 579.35 A: (( but uh )) 

578.37 579.37 B: well 

580.13 580.97 B: you're 

581.44 583.36 B: getting close to the end you might 

583.37 585.37 B: really think about that 

585.58 586.90 B: heaven and hell 

587.23 588.49 A: well 

587.80 592.60 B: i guess you've been doing that for years but you know the closer you get to the e- 

592.79 596.38 B: to you know being at one place the other you might uh 

596.43 599.89 B: start looking at it bit m- more and trying to figure it
