0.35 2.39 A: hi my name is michelle 

2.23 4.18 B: hi this is lynn 

4.20 5.37 A: hi lynn 

5.63 6.58 A: um 

6.62 11.89 A: topic is airport security do we think it lessens the chance of terrorism 

12.01 13.45 A: um well 

12.70 18.59 B: yeah and and just recently in the last few days i've learned that um 

18.85 23.50 B: pilots have now been trained and might be carrying firearms themselves 

23.13 26.26 A: yes that is actually o- officially the case 

26.53 37.66 A: um i have to say personally i feel very happy about that it makes me feel a lot safer i happen to have actually recently traveled and 

37.98 45.79 A: a- yes i do definitely agree that it does lessen the chances of a terror- any sort of terrorism act 

45.80 46.98 A: um 

47.07 53.51 B: i i think so too i think they've put into effect a lot of new measures the air marshals 

53.22 54.50 A: mhm 

53.88 54.97 B: for one 

54.87 55.99 A: mhm 

56.38 57.26 A: yes 

57.62 58.71 A: um 

58.42 61.60 B: that's kind of given me a sense of security 

61.77 71.64 A: right it it does give you a se- give me a sense of security also um but also to a certain extent it does make me a little bit leery just to know that 

71.67 81.75 A: you know the extent that we now have to go to because of what has happened um it sort of puts things in perspective for you 

77.47 78.56 B: right 

81.57 83.64 B: well it's sad i mean it's 

84.60 90.99 A: yes yes um i agree it is sad um but it is obviously measures that need to be taken 

91.24 93.71 A: and you know 

93.86 103.75 A: again it's i definitely feel a lot safer when i went through the um the airport you know they did everything from checking that the buckles of my shoes 

103.47 104.51 B: wow 

103.96 112.64 A: to um like checking the interior of my luggage to detect any sort of um like bomb residual 

112.91 116.01 B: but you know in my experience it's 

116.40 119.12 B: not added a tremendous amount 

119.75 121.18 B: to departure 

121.94 124.12 B: i've always gotten through 

124.48 127.84 B: the atlanta airport even fairly quickly 

128.08 129.42 A: really 

128.91 130.10 B: yeah 

130.21 131.93 B: and i thought gee 

132.13 136.42 B: you know they're doing all this extra stuff but apparently someone's 

137.13 142.55 B: trained them correctly or they're they're doing it right or allowing a little extra time 

142.75 143.69 B: um 

143.86 147.65 B: i haven't experienced any significant slow down 

147.59 148.64 A: mhm 

148.25 149.59 B: and 

149.69 152.26 B: i do feel much much more secure 

152.55 153.52 A: well 

153.49 156.37 A: as far as like the the delays 

156.30 169.35 A: it has gotten better um i remember one time where i was waiting in line for about forty five minutes close to an hour just waiting to get me um um through the security terminal thing 

169.36 176.50 A: and i mean last time i flew it was the pro- the whole process took like anywhere from fifteen to twenty minutes 

176.08 177.46 B: right 

176.80 186.48 A: very quick and so i'm sure you know at the beginning it's always that way where they first have to um address all the um the bottle neck issues and then 

186.21 190.10 B: in training and getting everybody accustomed to the new processing 

190.10 204.87 A: mhm right right and and again it's it's a sad state of affairs that we find ourselves in right now but it's measures need to be taken i feel definitely a lot safer flying 

190.58 192.05 B: things like that 

205.02 208.33 A: um although some of the things i just don't 

208.97 215.13 A: don't agree with like stuff that they do because it it just doesn't make any sense to me but 

216.12 219.22 A: things to need to be taken you know um 

219.07 222.01 B: well i i think at some level we have to 

223.52 230.97 B: believe that they know what they're doing and that this situation has been studied and studied and researched and 

231.06 234.11 B: that the measures that are in effect are 

234.40 236.27 B: are what need to be there 

236.49 239.60 B: even if we don't understand every single thing they do 

239.63 240.76 A: mhm 

240.96 241.88 A: that's 

242.40 245.30 A: yeah i i see what you're saying there um 

246.63 247.78 A: um 

249.39 253.35 A: this is a bit hard only because we both agree so [laughter] 

252.37 254.19 B: that's true [laughter] 

253.77 260.11 A: um when there's a disagreement at least you can sort of you know go back and forth right 

257.67 260.01 B: debate back and forth a little bit 

260.21 261.40 A: um 

261.55 263.04 A: but yeah i 

262.39 267.46 B: yeah well the obvious things are what make me feel more secure 

267.48 272.20 B: and the firearms and and training and things like that 

272.59 276.03 B: i'm glad it's not just some sort of willy nilly thing 

276.15 279.30 A: mhm mhm um 

279.94 287.51 A: what is what is your um sort of like i guess perspective on like um have you ever encountered any sort of like profiling 

287.46 301.10 A: not you personally but perhaps somebody that you know or something like that like those are some things that i know friends of mine have encountered um you know if they're of a certain ethnic background they tend to be a little bit more 

301.26 302.14 A: (( i )) 

302.46 304.24 A: guess [noise] what what's the word 

305.37 310.25 A: scrutinous of that individual you know when they go through that whole security process 

310.43 316.80 A: um and that sort of bothers me a little bit but i understand it but it still bothers me 

310.87 311.57 B: i 

314.30 315.64 B: i do too 

316.67 320.08 B: and and it is th- sort of this mixed emotion 

319.49 320.67 A: mhm 

321.48 323.30 A: yes um and 

322.53 326.10 B: in uh [laughter] it it that's a tough one 

326.26 328.94 B: that's a real tough one because 

329.90 331.56 B: there is 

333.31 343.02 B: you know clear evidence of of a particular age group um sex and ethnic background 

343.04 346.33 B: that has committed a lot of terrorist acts 

345.72 346.92 A: mhm 

347.92 352.15 B: yet anyone [laughter] that's in that same ethnic 

347.99 349.04 A: yes 

352.26 356.65 B: uh age group uh you know male sex 

358.17 363.53 B: could be condemned and could be abused and be totally innocent 

363.16 364.36 A: mhm 

364.64 369.89 A: and that's what scares me a little bit because you know in in their in the process of 

370.11 375.39 A: them of security doing their job sometimes it can be taken to the extreme 

375.54 382.78 A: and that scares me a little bit to know that that could possibly happen to someone that i know or that i care about 

382.32 383.50 B: right 

382.98 388.18 A: um but again i i understand it but it's just it is uh mixed emotions because 

388.35 397.95 A: it bothers me but i understand it and 'cause really you can't argue with someone that says well you know things like that are gonna happen and because 

397.82 404.10 A: of what has happened in the past blah blah blah blah but it just doesn't make it right in my view 

404.16 405.11 A: (( you know )) 

404.27 405.25 B: i know 

405.43 410.17 B: well what's scary is that type of of um 

410.87 415.36 B: thing goes on outside of any kind of security situation 

415.51 417.79 B: you know children have been targeted 

417.80 427.77 B: um people from india and greece and other places have been targeted just because they have a a a dark complexion and dark hair 

427.37 428.58 A: mhm 

428.19 430.73 B: and maybe a little accent or something 

430.49 431.50 A: mhm 

431.09 432.30 B: and 

433.19 437.47 A: right right i mean and just things like that you know 

435.54 440.37 B: and it it it does bother me too but it doesn't change the fact that 

440.47 441.35 B: that 

442.13 445.54 B: you know of who committed the crimes that are the 

445.66 448.26 B: top suspects uh 

450.03 452.18 B: of future crimes and 

451.55 453.17 A: mhm 

453.60 454.85 A: (( yeah )) 

454.32 456.56 B: you and you just hate to think that 

454.90 457.20 A: again i understand it 

457.23 459.52 A: i i definitely do but 

460.21 469.10 A: it just bothers me that we have to go through that or the people have to go through that anybody that is certifiably innocent 

466.23 468.03 B: well i mean it smacks of 

468.78 472.74 B: yeah i well and and it smacks of all the discrimination and 

469.14 471.68 A: you know and be put in that position 

473.58 476.94 B: you know targeting african americans and 

477.07 480.66 B: a- that have has gone on through the ages 

481.12 485.32 B: you know targeting certain groups of people because of the way they look 

485.01 486.23 A: mhm 

485.57 489.09 B: it's like the one bad apple spoils the whole bunch 

488.69 490.09 A: exactly 

489.30 490.80 B: everyone gets 

491.26 496.45 B: everyone of that type gets uh poor treatment because of a few 

496.60 498.11 A: exactly 

498.04 500.77 B: and i have not seen that myself 

501.15 502.09 B: um 

502.21 504.29 B: i know it has to happen 

504.12 505.27 A: mhm 

505.51 515.19 A: yeah e- exactly like last time um again 'cause i i just recently traveled there was one particular individual individual happened to be on line with us 

515.41 521.27 A: and um i i could tell that people were a little bit leery about you know 

521.44 524.36 A: having this person get on the same plane 

523.95 525.19 B: mhm 

524.57 530.87 A: um because of the way he looked and so forth and so on um you know he was of a certain ethnicity and 

531.01 533.23 A: people were just a little bit 

533.46 534.65 A: hesitant 

534.95 543.87 A: uncomfortable and you could feel it and that sort of bothered me a little i mean i i can't say that i wasn't i i was a little bit 

540.06 541.55 B: i wonder how 

543.95 558.95 A: um but it just bothered me that i myself was feeling this way when i really shouldn't you know i mean if this person's gotten to the point where he's about to board the plane then he should have passed through all the security process that everybody else goes through so 

558.57 561.56 B: and he and the others like him 

561.83 563.65 B: would have to know 

564.84 569.28 B: that they stand out in a crowd at this point especially at an airport 

567.56 568.56 A: mhm 

569.25 570.21 A: mhm 

570.66 573.77 B: and i just wonder how they feel about that i 

575.01 578.84 B: i wonder if they try to avoid airport airline travel 

577.59 578.41 A: [laughter] 

579.41 581.61 A: yeah um 

581.69 582.90 B: just because 

583.28 597.05 A: yeah i i mean i'm sure it's not a very overall well good situation for them to you know be the um target of of these types of of acts um 

584.35 587.11 B: even and even if they go through all the right steps 

596.73 599.50 B: or just walking around feeling like a suspect 

599.30 599.89 A: right
