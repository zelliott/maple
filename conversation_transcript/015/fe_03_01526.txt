112.66 113.61 A: [noise] 

113.79 124.52 B: when you're got that kind of money you've got easy access to that kind of thing it's just it's just ridiculous [mn] the whole thing you're right it's greed it's selfishness it's 

116.98 118.50 A: [noise] sure 

124.45 131.41 B: just i'd like to know what would happen if everybody said well oh you're on strike too bad now you don't have a job anymore

137.55 145.30 A: it's the way our society works and i understand that but it it just it really makes me sick that so many people 

145.63 148.18 A: do that you know i mean 

149.05 157.30 A: how much is enough when when is it enough and to go on strike you're earning millions of dollars some people can't even make house payments some people are homeless 

156.69 163.19 B: some people have no food [laughter] i know it just really upsets me that they have the nerve to act like that 

158.52 159.39 A: (( yes )) 

162.85 164.19 A: yes yes 

163.42 169.15 B: they're making more money than probably fifty people i know put together and they're acting like you know

179.03 180.07 A: [noise] 

181.84 182.95 A: [noise] 

184.20 187.38 B: [laughter] you got a little one 

185.02 192.68 A: i'm sorry about my kids in the background by the way [noise] i'm sorry about that [laughter] 

188.44 190.16 B: (( it's all right )) 

190.59 196.31 B: believe me i'm used to it my daughter's grown up but i have nieces and nephews and believe me i'm used to it 

193.80 203.54 A: okay [noise] right [laughter] so you understand okay as long as you understand but they uh no i just don't think i mean 

198.81 200.74 B: oh yeah i do 

203.51 218.26 A: it it just seems like [noise] it's more about the money now than the game and it used to be even especially with baseball baseball was always you know an american dream an american pastime and and people would go ahead and do it for the love of the game 

213.31 214.77 B: right 

217.60 223.01 B: but now it's for the money and if there's no money you know if it's not good enough money then 

222.66 234.64 A: well it's even to a point where i've seen like stories about like athletes will go ahead and they won't sign autographs and stuff because people are putting it on ebay and and 

234.55 240.39 A: making money off of it and it it's just become even on the fans with kids and stuff 

238.82 239.76 B: yeah 

240.46 246.72 A: it's just become to a point where you know the athletes athletes don't even trust 

246.84 250.61 A: you know the kids not to go ahead 

249.74 252.07 B: and go sell something and 

250.74 255.41 A: yeah and that's that's really that that's just so sad you know 

254.38 260.39 B: well if uh if the fans didn't support them with their ridiculous salaries 

260.27 269.85 B: they wouldn't be able to go on strike and then they wouldn't have to worry about anybody selling their stuff and you know i mean it all just goes back to greed you're right 

269.14 270.36 A: it's cyclical 

270.15 283.79 B: yeah it's just it just gets to be one big mess and i mean i personally you know i mean i've been to professional [noise] games i have no real interest in them they're getting paid to play how you know what a rough life 

270.59 271.53 A: yeah 

279.65 280.67 A: right 

283.32 285.59 A: [noise] oh i know i know

289.08 293.00 A: it's it's just it's amazing i just i just uh 

293.13 299.21 A: i don't think there's any debate i think that by [noise] michael jordan might've might have deserved 

299.42 301.07 A: how much he 

301.38 308.15 A: had [noise] spent uh was paid because he drew in the crowds and he made [noise] so much money for the bowl 

307.91 318.67 B: right and he basically was the whole basketball team i mean yeah i mean but when you're playing football or baseball there isn't one person that's doing it all 

311.68 313.37 A: [noise] yes [noise] yes 

315.13 316.70 A: [noise] 

318.71 331.56 A: right right oh oh excuse me one second hey hey we do not hit each other we do not hit each other [noise] i think they're in training to be mike tyson when they grow up or something i don't know [noise] uh [laughter] 

328.81 333.93 B: [laughter] the- from the sound of their voices i'd say they're about three or four 

332.30 339.33 A: [noise] um ah ye- one's almost three the other is four yes yeah [laughter] 

337.78 343.00 B: yeah it's about the same age as my niece and nephew and they will not leave each other alone 

342.53 357.50 A: we were hoping to have 'em that close together so they'd be uh friends anyway i guess i don't know that they really want us discussing all this stuff i suppose we're supposed to stick to athlete's being on strike but i just don't see that there's a debate there with the amount of homelessness and with the amount of people 

345.76 346.66 B: [laughter] 

350.35 351.39 B: i know 

357.74 367.95 A: and just the fine they have talent they bring in people but the salary caps keep getting higher and higher and they get keeping paid more and more and how much is enough when 

363.07 365.20 B: yeah it it's enough 

367.09 372.70 B: right and not there should be feeling there where they can't abuse their uh 

372.93 376.11 B: uh ability to draw on any money thing 

375.86 390.10 A: yeah [noise] i mean they're so full full of themselves thinking that they're worth all this money and oh we'll go on strike 'cause you're not paying us this much money and they live in their big mansions and they have the parties and they have all these 

376.24 378.04 B: i'm sure there's someone 

379.84 381.11 B: right 

390.24 396.79 A: groupies hanging around just wanting to be with a sports star and i mean look at magic johnson

440.46 442.34 A: i totally agree with you 

442.18 451.43 B: i'd really like to see them like you said before either tell 'em oh you don't wanna play too bad then we'll replace you 'cause i'm sure there's a million people who would love to take their place 

448.26 449.04 A: yeah 

450.98 452.07 A: exactly 

451.33 460.00 B: or i'd like to say to to have them say this is how much you make for the position you play and no one's ever getting any more money than this you know and
