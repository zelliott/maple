106.97 107.98 B: uh-huh 

109.12 110.80 B: yeah right 

110.18 115.70 A: ah prominent but i originally i was um more afraid to fly 

115.46 116.41 B: uh-huh 

116.28 125.05 A: um but i'm not so much af- i i i don't like flying anyway so i can't really distinguish any more if it's because of that or 

124.54 127.63 B: well yeah that's what i mean too because i didn't 

128.04 132.77 B: anyway so but then kind of was put a little bit more you know 

133.44 134.59 B: but ah 

134.46 136.19 A: yeah 

136.21 138.26 B: where i mean now 

138.49 151.22 B: like i say the different i don't know what proximity in the united states you are but we're in an area that i would say it's a little closer to where things happened in pennsylvania and so it made a lot of things more 

152.16 161.46 B: oh a little closer you know to home some of the things that were happening the anthrax a few things and you know even at a college near us were 

158.65 160.12 A: yeah 

161.65 167.31 B: left and right there for a while that was really you know keeping everybody on their toes and 

167.34 173.38 B: wasn't that far from where the one plane went down like maybe about ninety miles 

173.38 174.73 A: yeah 

175.63 178.04 A: yeah my um my mom 

178.08 184.31 A: is really concerned especially when they had the um [lipsmack] the orange warning 

184.33 188.38 A: for the first time and we're having news broadcasts about 

184.81 185.50 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

188.57 192.68 A: ah 'cause they live in the d._c. area so she was worried 

191.12 192.22 B: yeah 

192.78 193.81 A: um 

193.96 198.68 A: she's worried that they're the one of the main targets so she went out and bought all 

198.94 205.86 A: the plastic sheeting and duct tape and the you know emergency food supplies and 

203.25 205.34 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

205.55 212.59 B: well yeah we got close to you know thinking i mean we have stuff on hand that's similar to that but ah 

212.75 213.49 B: we 

213.67 215.28 B: you know i can 

216.33 224.31 B: like i say that crossed our minds ah you know getting those things on hand even you know for this last 

224.38 230.81 B: time you know that's when it went on to right before the war when it went on to orange yeah 

229.58 230.87 A: (( yeah )) 

231.43 239.40 B: uh-huh but ah like i said it'd just even though you think well this is just another there's still just that little inkling there maybe [laughter] 

239.71 242.82 B: because actually right after it happened we had a 

239.95 240.77 A: yeah 

242.93 248.24 B: trip planned it happened let's say on september eleventh and we ah 

248.33 258.12 B: were set up to go to myrtle beach which would have been the twenty fourth and we you know of course it was going to be a driving trip with another couple and 

258.23 259.33 A: yeah 

258.77 265.06 B: and and we we we were there and it was funny we we were near an army surplus store and we 

265.39 279.14 B: conned a the other the other couple the girl to go in and just ask [laughter] about gas masks i mean you know where normally you would have thought oh my word what a silly thing to do you know what i mean but it was right within like i say about 

276.50 277.45 A: yeah 

280.00 283.23 B: ten days or so from happening and 

283.76 284.90 B: you know and 

284.84 297.27 B: course they says well it just it wouldn't much help you anyways unless you had it right with you all the time because sometimes you only get seconds and since most a lot of the ones they sell anyways don't have all the right maybe the 

297.11 302.42 B: filters or this or that so unless you have a new state of the art like the army [laughter] 

302.26 303.13 A: (( uh-huh )) 

302.51 308.23 B: now i look back at it i think oh dear you know but at that time right after that yeah 

308.37 309.16 B: we 

309.80 320.14 B: but it it does give everybody a little different food thinking and you did before like you say you get lax and nothing happens and you get less cautious but 

318.79 319.72 A: yeah 

320.64 323.47 A: yeah you do and and um 

323.52 333.82 A: i was actually living in africa when it happened so it was strange because the impact was a little less for it was still a big impact but it was all um 

327.15 328.09 B: oh 

330.04 331.37 B: yeah 

333.83 345.47 A: i didn't have very much access to t._v. so i couldn't see what was happening it was more ah b._b._c. news coverage but then i came home about ah 

336.55 338.28 B: right uh-huh 

339.97 341.50 B: yeah 

345.73 347.40 A: two months after 

347.80 353.32 A: after it happened and every everywhere i went there were flags 

353.55 354.88 B: oh yeah 

353.69 356.29 A: american flags on cars 

355.51 357.71 B: probably looked different yeah [laughter] 

357.10 366.14 A: yeah and that that that made i saw the started seeing the flags in a different way and when i saw that it it it 

365.64 366.22 B: (( mhm )) 

366.24 367.84 A: was very moving 

367.41 377.48 B: well it brought people all kind of together here in a different sense maybe where people were more oh you know wouldn't look at you twice normally or more 

377.52 386.47 B: everybody to themselves and i'm going about my business and made people you know camaraderie there where everybody was a little more you know 

386.34 387.35 A: yeah 

386.98 388.70 B: friendlier like ah 

393.00 399.48 B: but you know like if you had to fly home then a couple of months after that that was kind of scary for the first time or 

400.71 402.03 A: yeah it was 

402.17 404.10 A: yeah that was definitely 

404.13 407.42 A: a little more scary than usual 

407.13 408.30 B: mhm 

407.73 412.74 A: for me um but but now with 

412.92 418.47 A: now as the way i see all those flags around 

417.62 418.64 B: mhm 

418.70 423.72 A: has changed since then um because they they've been 

424.48 425.62 A: um 

426.38 429.05 A: like my bank um had 

430.20 432.34 A: the ah bank card that i 

432.68 438.04 A: that i got when i moved um to philadelphia had um 

438.86 450.36 A: has a american flag on it and that makes me doesn't give me [laughter] give me the same feeling as it did when i saw all the flags when i came home because it's 

450.51 455.41 A: clear a american flag on a visa card is a much different 

455.85 457.68 A: message and 

457.76 458.88 A: that i don't 

459.95 460.93 A: um 

461.67 465.73 A: so some- sometimes i feel like that it has been used too much 

465.27 478.39 B: well i know what you mean there are some of the ones you mean like businesses are taking advantage of throwing um how would you say it what's happened or an emblem of it into their buy buy 

479.09 480.94 B: making it their slogan 

481.02 482.01 A: yeah 

481.43 486.70 B: rather than the genuine- genuineness of what it was yeah 

486.39 487.46 A: yeah 

486.86 488.56 B: yeah 

488.32 491.32 A: it's a misuse of the flag 

490.70 502.02 B: yeah that's kind of yeah like i say it's just like they say even i don't know i don't know how true it is but pepsi had a somebody had passed on the internet there that oh they're coming out with a 

502.19 510.08 B: kind of an american type pepsi can and they're going to have the pledge of allegiance on it but not to um 

511.14 516.75 B: to offend their employees they were going to have the pledge of allegiance on it but take out the words under god 

516.44 517.64 A: mhm 

517.06 519.32 B: and ah so 

519.70 524.00 B: they're even kind of using the situation to advertise their 

524.04 525.37 B: product 

526.22 527.22 A: yeah 

526.62 529.95 B: but i mean you know there's like i say there's 

530.07 532.26 B: after it's happened there's 

532.55 536.82 B: there's as many people as it brought together there's probably a lot that 

536.94 544.42 B: how would you say it took advantage of the situation that happened too you know maybe in getting ah people more 

541.46 542.38 A: yeah 

544.64 548.20 B: scared like well you know you buy like you 

548.67 553.74 B: buy this and that to protect yourself and you don't know you know 

554.52 555.54 B: they're 

555.83 558.97 B: really making money off of it more than helping you 

559.04 560.01 A: yeah 

559.44 560.78 B: now i didn't 

561.89 568.18 B: well maybe you travel and you would have had different shots and that like a smallpox shot wouldn't you being in africa or not 

568.33 571.48 A: they no they didn't give us smallpox shots 

570.81 571.66 B: (( didn't you )) 

571.57 572.57 A: no 

572.25 574.15 B: but i know now they're becoming 

574.77 578.02 B: available of course i guess they're just to the health 

578.22 579.73 B: workers now 

579.69 583.66 A: would you get would you consider getting one or 

580.66 581.67 B: (( i )) 

581.73 590.60 B: i i don't i don't know see i'm at an age where i believe when i was in school i think i had one but i don't think 

591.24 594.96 B: i don't think really it's something that lasts that long you know as we're 

596.17 597.14 A: yeah 

597.21 599.95 B: before they stopped giving them you know
