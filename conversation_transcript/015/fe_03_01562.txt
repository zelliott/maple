5.02 6.79 B: mhm 

9.14 17.78 B: ah you know for some reason the line is sounding a little faint to me so i feel it would help you to it would help me a lot if you'd speak up because i can barely even hear what the lady was saying 

15.46 16.86 A: (( so yes )) 

17.56 20.63 A: yeah it was sounding a little faint to me too yes 

20.72 22.32 A: can you hear any better 

22.30 24.08 B: yeah i hear a lot better thank you 

23.65 24.75 A: okay 

25.37 27.42 B: is everything okay on your side 

26.79 29.20 A: yes uh-huh yeah i can hear you now 

28.96 35.34 B: all right well ah to reiterate the topic they were she was asking what our opinions were about ah 

35.39 37.98 B: ath- athletes going on strike 

37.36 41.70 A: yes i didn't know if they were talking about something current that was at hand or 

41.77 45.81 A: an athlete per se or like a whole like when baseball 

46.02 47.60 A: you know had a 

47.80 52.30 A: was out there some years back and they almost cancelled 

49.95 52.13 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

52.42 54.15 A: the world series 

54.91 61.34 B: yeah i remember that ah i think it was a strike about wages right 

56.48 57.44 A: uh-huh 

60.31 62.31 A: um yeah 

62.34 67.94 A: that's nine times out of ten that's mostly you know what it is i mean [laughter] 

62.46 63.52 B: yeah 

68.46 69.91 B: for any kind of strike 

69.68 70.68 A: yeah 

71.00 72.17 A: the only 

71.47 72.87 B: (( well mm )) 

72.75 76.11 A: any particular ones stand out that you can think of 

76.12 83.56 B: i don't remember very many strikes you know i don't i don't really look at you know major league baseball strikes as much as some of the others 

83.64 84.97 B: (( but ah )) 

85.70 91.48 B: in my opinion those baseball players get paid a whole lot more than you'd think for what they do 

92.81 95.54 B: if you were put in the in a holistic sense 

94.85 95.92 A: mhm 

96.46 99.61 B: baseball players don't actually produce anything 

99.74 105.75 B: you know they don't make computers or design or make or or create cures or 

105.88 107.72 B: anything like that they entertain 

107.79 112.42 A: yeah unfortunately though it's sometimes it's like 

112.60 125.45 A: how would you say it though some of them they're just the big mo- mo- money contracts are dangled in front of some of them though it's like [laughter] you know young ones coming out scouting you'll see like even basketballers some of them though 

125.25 137.77 A: something ridiculous for somebody that's just a rookie though they won't even ask for it and they'll dangle to them oh we'll give you you know sixty million or eighty million so in my mind a lot of it is on ah 

138.37 143.48 A: the organizations themselves [laughter] they're almost asking for it 

141.20 142.19 B: mhm 

143.88 145.23 B: yeah 

144.38 147.82 A: because they want somebody so bad so they'll just come up with some 

148.13 152.81 A: thing real high you know that maybe the person didn't even expect but yeah 

152.88 156.23 A: i know what you mean in the sense of it's not somebody like 

156.65 160.31 A: you know like you say somebody that's invented some cure or 

161.09 162.94 A: something like that but ah 

163.09 169.22 A: it's like i say it's kinda i guess fifty fifty though because like i say i've kind of 

170.08 184.14 A: follow um football quite a bit and i know ones where they'll just like i say they'll give them something ridiculous they'll just you know offer and then probably somebody else sees that down the road and [laughter] 

184.35 186.65 A: well we're going to go on strike ah 

187.68 189.15 B: (( yes )) 

190.19 192.25 B: also my opinion ah 

192.73 195.96 B: although you know holistically they don't make anything 

196.38 198.87 B: (( economically ah )) 

199.06 202.03 B: you know wages are kind of set by 

202.35 208.48 B: a deb- demand and supply and demand like you know the average revenue comes in through that kind of thing 

208.60 211.39 B: but ah it also reflects on the wages 

211.59 218.34 B: and you know professional sports like your baseball and football and 

216.78 220.54 A: but ah well even nascar yes nascar mhm 

218.74 219.49 B: (( huh )) 

219.87 221.51 B: yeah even that one too 

221.80 223.98 B: that's one of the most expensive sport 

223.92 228.05 A: oh that's that's up there i mean surprisingly i 

228.22 229.63 A: just listening 

229.60 242.82 A: i never realized basketball was so up there i mean football some of them really there they're really putting their body on the line more than some of them in a sense of where their how do you say it their longevity as it too you know 

241.90 243.71 B: yeah 

242.69 249.22 A: like some some race up into the fifties i mean you see 'em and even baseball they can go under the 

249.34 250.30 A: but ah 

250.93 256.91 A: i don't quite begrudge it as much on maybe somebody that has quite a you know 

257.54 264.91 A: body grinding thing because you look at somebody that makes a movie and what what ridiculous price do they get [laughter] 

264.97 267.91 A: they're not putting their body on the line at all so 

267.56 269.33 B: yeah 

268.50 269.55 A: but ah 

269.90 275.15 B: really those industries that do not produce anything i think they're basically run on demand like people 

276.49 279.21 B: like people that really are into the sports 

278.99 280.10 A: (( mhm )) 

279.35 283.09 B: they would almost demand it it's considered part of the demand i suppose 

283.29 284.58 B: so there is a high 

284.82 286.05 B: want 

286.23 292.03 B: to put in different words a high want for these sports to see these professional leagues go at it 

290.87 291.94 A: mhm 

292.02 296.15 B: so it controls these wages they like all the people who go to the games 

296.10 307.40 B: put in a a pretty good chunk of money and it gets pooled and distributed so there's a lot of revenue in there and as far as those baseball contracts are concerned ah 

308.19 313.81 B: well a contract's a contract if they signed on it if those players signed on it then 

313.89 315.60 B: they agreed to it 

315.70 317.03 A: right mhm of 

317.28 331.77 A: course a lot of those things don't mean much because i know ones that have signed contracts for blank blank for six years and if they decide to cut 'em the next year that that contract almost it's not like a true contract like 

331.65 336.80 A: a wage earner would have that's set and you know because they're they're not held 

336.51 338.80 B: mhm 

336.85 340.53 A: held to it like like in a true other true thing 

340.45 342.25 B: yeah 

341.16 342.01 A: (( but )) 

342.85 345.96 A: like i say i'm i just was trying to think of any other 

346.15 359.12 A: ones that they meant but all like i say the only ones i can ever remember i mean football i can't remember a strike i mean back i just heard about ones that happened before i ever even knew about it you know i mean like there was the old 

357.16 358.97 B: mhm mhm 

358.99 361.44 A: one where some of them come in and 

362.17 374.80 A: ah what do they call them like well just like a worker they call them scabs they came in and they had a few teams playing but this is something i've just read about back in the i don't know if it was in the eighties or this or they had one 

374.50 375.51 B: wow 

375.18 376.18 A: but ah 

376.27 383.97 A: baseball like i said i do remember that year just but other than that i'm just i don't know like if nascar or 

384.04 385.56 A: basketball 

384.58 386.66 B: mhm 

386.17 387.15 A: [laughter] 

386.77 389.80 B: i don't know if i've ever heard of any nascar strikes 

389.62 391.68 A: yeah but ah 

392.49 394.35 A: like i say i guess 

394.38 397.36 A: i suppose how would you say it if 

398.38 400.62 A: there's there's like a 

400.75 405.33 A: i don't know what type of union you know there is involved but i suppose if people 

405.98 411.19 A: that work at ah any other type of industry from teachers on down i guess 

411.66 415.31 A: you could say that's their right i suppose to 

415.33 418.85 A: sometimes they're not always for wages sometimes they're for 

418.80 431.01 A: maybe a condition you know certain safety conditions like if it would be in you know nascar or different things so i could see if it's in some line like that 

425.02 427.01 B: mhm 

431.05 434.93 B: mhm but not so much on wages but maybe the conditions 

433.46 435.25 A: right mhm mm 

435.74 439.06 B: yeah that's the only way i can imagine it either i mean 

439.76 446.67 B: if somebody comes up to you and offers you five million dollars over six years to work hard 

446.83 453.32 B: if you think about it they play for maybe six hours practice for maybe twenty thirty forty a week 

453.49 458.75 B: that's that's still a lot of money that's maybe like hundreds of dollars an hour they're being paid 

458.88 463.31 B: so i'm sure nobody complains so badly about that but maybe you know 

464.23 473.60 B: but maybe let's say one year into the contract you're cut and you don't get like you don't get pro rated for you know how much you've worked for for that amount of the year 

474.50 476.87 B: that would be pretty disappointing and ah 

477.27 479.84 B: angry especially if you've had a injury 

479.96 481.35 A: right yes 

480.78 489.94 B: so basically you work for these people you don't get the money and then you're left crippled well maybe not crippled but left in a way that you can't work for another baseball team 

489.84 490.81 A: right 

490.86 493.83 B: (( so that that would that would be kind of lousy )) 

494.51 496.46 A: (( yes like i say i ah )) 

497.51 501.00 A: you know knew of situations like that like they were 

502.57 508.54 A: so i i guess if you know a strike depending there there could be 

509.10 517.86 A: certain circumstances where i'd say no it's bad for the but then usually it's funny the the fans they are mad at first but then 

518.17 524.28 A: they [laughter] they'll say we ain't ever going to like after the baseball one you know it kind of 

524.82 529.65 A: people go and went down a little bit then it didn't it didn't last very long it's like 

529.68 533.66 A: people will say if they have something they like they're quick to forgive i guess 

532.22 535.33 B: mhm 

534.41 535.36 A: (( but )) 

537.62 539.76 B: yeah ah 

539.92 542.94 B: so i guess do you think we could both agree that ah 

543.02 549.50 B: it will be right for them to strike if they had if there was something unfair about the conditions of the contract 

549.52 551.02 A: yes right 

551.19 555.59 B: yeah that would happen with just about anything 

554.81 558.60 A: but usually it can't be because an in general thing 

558.62 560.68 A: would be because everybody is 

560.70 569.72 A: being offered a separate amount so i don't think i've ever heard of just oh i've heard one person they used the word hold out like one particular person you know what i mean 

568.81 570.55 B: (( mhm )) 

569.52 579.20 A: but it ain't a strike because nobody's getting the same amount so usually like i say when they do go on strike i am not sure like i say with the baseball one 

579.02 587.68 A: if you know what i mean everybody was getting a separate amount some could have been very happy with their wage and so and it ha- had to be something else you know what i mean 

587.58 588.73 B: (( yes )) 

587.68 599.89 A: because it's not like an industry where we will say everybody's making blank an hour and we're you know we all want a blank an hour raise it it had to be a little more to
