21.96 27.84 B: yeah yeah um actually it's kinda funny i was just talking to someone earlier about the same topic but uh 

27.86 31.49 B: yeah as far as uh affecting my life goes um 

31.64 43.42 B: it really hasn't changed it that much uh i'd say the biggest thing would be it's made me maybe be more aware of the events that are going aro- going on around the entire world um 

42.42 44.10 A: very definitely definitely 

43.90 54.03 B: uh as far as flying goes um i'm really not that you know scared you could say or i you know i'm not afraid of flying really from it um 

54.05 59.43 B: i mean the way i look at flying is i i still look at it as the safest way to travel and uh 

59.41 69.16 B: i'm also a devout christian so uh the way the way i look at it too is you know if the good lord wants to take my life well then he must have a good reason for it and i'm not going to argue with him so 

69.26 70.90 B: so be it but uh 

71.25 76.69 B: i mean i'll still get on a plane and if i have to and uh well i mean i'll have maybe a 

76.83 88.09 B: slig- just bit of you know extra fear in the back of my mind but uh overall it you know i really haven't i haven't my life has not been changed that much from the events 

79.44 80.28 A: (( yes )) 

88.53 90.23 A: definitely i mean 

91.23 98.79 A: um [mn] i'm actually an indian uh like from indi- my parents are from india and that i was born here in a american in dallas but uh 

95.67 96.89 B: oh yeah 

99.73 106.48 A: i mean other than getting some you know a little bit more hassle at the at the airports you know 

106.61 112.45 A: those they're pick on they're pick on anybody that looks you know pakistani or persian 

111.00 114.68 B: right so that must be that might be you know tough for your parents or 

114.56 120.33 A: that might be a little tough but like really i mean i've that's happened to me a couple of times i've been searched a little extra but like 

118.98 119.94 B: oh yeah 

120.12 123.52 A: i mean other than that like outside the airport i mean 

123.31 129.11 A: honestly you're you're you hit it right on the head that you you're more aware of the events going on in the world you know what i mean there's 

128.00 129.36 B: mhm 

128.91 139.11 A: before before uh nine eleven i didn't know where kabul was you know i didn't if somebody asked me what kabul was i would be i thought it would be a dish or something you know but [laughter] 

133.00 134.27 B: exactly 

137.44 139.42 B: mhm yep 

139.15 151.03 A: but uh yeah it's made me more aware of the of the international issues i think it's like more important than some- sometimes you know like some you know it just it just makes you more educated i think and uh 

147.42 148.60 B: mhm 

149.31 150.72 B: mhm 

151.58 158.72 A: yeah i mean it it's had its negative effects but i think it's made us more aware about the issues going on the world i guess 

157.21 158.45 B: right 

158.70 169.63 B: yeah and and i well i'm also happy to see i mean i i think overall security measures have they've they've really they've done a pretty good job with beefing up the security i mean you know it might be 

166.46 167.78 A: oh yeah 

169.58 178.03 B: i mean you see you to an airport now and it takes hours you know obvious to to search people i mean sometimes they say you have to take out all your belongings from your 

177.90 178.98 A: mhm 

177.96 184.62 B: your um suitcase and whatnot but you know the thing is i mean that's gonna make it more safe to fly so 

179.12 180.15 A: yeah 

184.67 196.10 B: you know i i i wouldn't have a problem with that if it was gonna take me an extra two hours um at least i know that uh they're gonna i mean if somebody's gonna try and do something they're gonna catch 'em 

195.48 199.24 A: yeah exactly it makes just it's just more safe you know i i mean 

198.06 201.04 B: yep yeah 

200.67 203.23 A: it's just some security that you have i mean 

203.74 213.45 A: really i am i am a little bit more wary of of of terrorist attacks i mean not not not airplanes running into buildings really but more sort of you know like 

209.85 210.92 B: mhm 

214.17 216.64 A: going on all these suicide bombs that 

215.98 219.51 B: right yeah exactly yeah they're gonna try and find other ways yeah 

216.79 218.65 A: that could happen at any time 

219.09 226.09 A: that could happen at any time and nobody would ever know about it it doesn't take much planning it just takes some crazy guy you know to pull the strings [laughter] 

224.14 226.92 B: mhm yeah yep 

226.35 233.78 A: and we're dead so that's what i'm really just i fear but hopefully that won't happen 'cause the people are 

227.20 228.60 B: mhm 

233.80 238.31 A: i guess like the terrorist organizations know where we'll find 'em so [laughter] [mn] 

237.70 248.79 B: mhm yeah exactly i yeah i think overall too with the the the organizations um within the government that they're crea- obviously the homeland security thing was developed after uh 

248.69 262.68 B: you know the september eleventh issue and i i think they've been doing a good job with you know trying to find every terrorist group out there or any possible connections with terrorist group and and taking care of them you know dealing with them 

261.70 262.72 A: mhm 

262.76 269.41 B: and um that that makes you know that makes me more feel more safe as well um but that i mean 

269.58 282.38 B: i if anything i i feel more securer more safe now as opposed to more being more scared or you know after that event occurred just because it's it's made you know so many 

277.27 278.40 A: yeah yeah 

282.75 288.44 B: so many of these people who deal with this stuff you know beef up their their their measures of controlling it 

287.24 296.88 A: yeah that sounds like i mean what what do you feel about what do you feel how much are you willing to give up to to have just a little bit more security 

297.12 298.25 B: um 

298.54 301.62 B: i'd be willing to give up a lot i'd say um 

302.28 303.77 B: you know it's uh 

303.95 305.43 B: if it means 

305.82 307.09 B: let me think 

308.38 309.40 B: well 

308.80 313.66 A: i mean i ask because 'cause i mean as a as a minority here in america 

313.77 317.72 A: i mean i'm just i'm thinking i'm just more susceptible to 

317.94 323.46 A: people will find out i mean i guess if if if the f._b._i. want to find out who i really am they're know that 

322.86 324.00 B: mhm 

323.38 336.33 A: i'm i'm a i'm a hindu american and i'm not a i'm not a muslim or anything but i mean i don't think that should be a way to profile people but i think that's i mean it's the truth is it's it's it's 

326.13 327.38 B: right 

328.98 329.80 B: mhm 

336.32 346.20 A: it's islamic fundamentalist you know and and terrorism extreme etcetera are the ones that are blowing up the cities and and you know crashes planes into buildings so 

344.18 345.58 B: mhm 

346.18 357.74 A: i mean the- they might be on the right side but i don't i don't think it's it's really right to say that they're the only ones that are capable of committing a terrorist attack i mean timothy mcveagh [laughter] 

351.42 352.45 B: right 

354.14 356.87 B: oh exactly i mean 

356.86 369.20 B: somebody that's uh a regular american i mean can d- can do what uh you know those are the people overseas the the um for instance osama bin laden and his group you know he can somebo- somebody that's an american can do that exact same thing 

369.43 370.38 B: um 

369.67 373.91 A: exactly somebody that can for somebody that believes in osama bin laden ties i mean 

373.30 375.30 B: (( exact- mhm yeah )) 

373.96 376.53 A: i i think there's plenty of people here that are 

376.11 377.76 B: oh yeah definitely 

376.81 383.30 A: more pro palestinian than [laughter] and uh especially at u._t. austin is a really liberal campus and 

382.68 386.56 B: yeah well that's the same here at pen state i mean it's a big school there's a 

384.47 385.79 A: yeah exactly 

386.77 389.02 B: big diversity on the campus 

386.85 387.88 A: [laughter] 

388.93 399.39 A: exactly so i mean there's just plenty of people that are that are just fanatic about [laughter] free palestine i mean that's that's what i think a really big thing coming 

394.77 396.60 B: mhm 

399.09 400.01 B: yep 

399.42 403.17 A: and i think i think i thin it is right to give i mean like 

403.26 412.45 A: a little bit of uh more attention to palestine i mean but but i think that shouldn't be a cas- that shouldn't be a cause for you know causing a lot trouble mischief in the world but 

411.90 413.10 B: right 

412.55 413.44 A: i mean 

413.59 418.97 B: well yes and now with the whol- the whole war thing that just occurred and with iraqi and then you have 

418.92 429.91 B: those countries being thrown in to the whole gist of things now too and investigating them more and obvious there was always the possible linkage between osama bin laden and saddam hussein as well 

423.66 425.09 A: yeah 

429.99 430.90 B: so 

430.11 441.40 A: oh yeah [laughter] it's scary huh it's scary what these people can do but [laughter] hopefully uh hopefully george bush knows what he's doing i think i think i'm pretty confident in what he's doing 

431.29 432.51 B: (( yeah i mean )) 

432.94 433.82 B: yep 

435.07 436.39 B: mhm 

440.97 450.49 B: yeah i am too i i i think he's doing overall a good job i mean obviously every i think every leader has their strengths and their weaknesses you know you're going to have that with anybody 

450.20 451.34 A: (( yeah )) 

450.67 462.14 B: and their downsides but you you just hope that i mean they certainly i trust that the person that got that position you know they it's not like they're a slacker or anything like that um 

461.48 462.81 A: yeah definitely 

462.60 463.79 B: you know they 

462.97 466.45 A: george bush seems like he cares [laughter] it does seem like it 

464.47 474.36 B: exactly yeah mhm and something like this something that's gonna affect you know every individual person in not just america but the entire world you know they 

466.80 468.16 A: i'd like to pass that 

474.59 480.53 B: that means them as well and so they're gonna do whatever they can to uh to uh control it 

480.13 481.19 A: mhm 

480.62 482.12 B: and make things better 

482.14 490.11 A: let me ask you i was i was uh watching the today show a couple of months ago actually and uh they had uh kitty craig was interviewing bill clinton and uh 

490.20 495.26 A: she asked him what his biggest regret was when he was in term when he was in when he was president 

494.66 495.97 B: mhm 

495.42 502.00 A: and he said and he said not catching osama bin laden i mean does that make you cringe or what i mean 'cause 

502.13 505.79 B: i i'm sorry what did you say he what he wasn't doing i'm sorr- 

505.24 510.75 A: no no he he had a bill clinton i mean he admitted that he had osama bin laden 

510.46 511.74 B: oh oh okay 

511.11 515.66 A: but uh i don't know some some something i don't know he couldn't get him so 

515.70 516.43 B: (( mm )) 

516.30 522.20 A: so i don't know that just that just makes me you know that just makes me kinda cringe there you know i mean like 

521.34 522.98 B: mhm 

522.32 526.02 A: we didn't do enough in the past to to prevent these kind of 

526.03 532.75 A: these kind of attacks though [laughter] may be there might may be we might be you know like in twenty years maybe not now but in twenty years 

527.62 528.94 B: right 

531.48 532.44 B: (( yeah )) 

533.13 539.30 A: and the president at that time will will also like maybe start slacking maybe maybe take things for granted and 

533.17 534.27 B: and it's 

538.94 547.15 B: yep yeah and it's it's unfortunate that it took you know the september eleventh attack to make things you know 

539.43 540.89 A: and it'll happen again 

547.18 555.24 B: our our security measures and whatnot and dealing with terrorists is it's unfortunate that it made that you know get better 

556.18 563.11 B: you know so i mean it's that that's the case in a lot of stuff you know unfortunately you have to pay the price in order to to um 

563.68 565.21 B: make things better 

565.46 566.54 B: but uh 

567.33 578.75 B: let's just hope that we we keep improving those those measures and they just they keep on getting better and better as each day goes by so we don't have to deal with anything like this again 

578.65 582.33 A: mhm yeah well let's just hope [laughter] 

581.67 595.37 B: yep i feel pretty confident that it that it will i guess that i mean it overall i don't i mean maybe that's the first couple of days after the the whole attacks especially because the one plane crash was uh 

582.66 583.65 A: 'cause uh 

595.41 599.89 B: was very near here it was you know maybe about an hour or so away from here 

599.02 599.89 A: oh really yeah
