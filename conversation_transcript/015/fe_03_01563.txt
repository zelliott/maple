14.76 17.54 B: oh okay i'm in columbia south carolina 

16.89 20.82 A: oh wow okay so i didn't know they did it all over the place i i'm in the 

19.66 24.14 B: yeah i i talked to a lady from uh denver the other day 

23.60 27.06 A: oh okay i'm in philadelphia yeah i thought everybody was in philadelphia this 

26.96 28.87 B: no you might in fact you 

29.03 33.73 B: you know she was in denver um i but this is the second call how many calls have you done 

33.20 35.07 A: is only my second also 

35.31 43.22 B: oh okay well anyway uh what do you think about athletes and their and their strikes and and demanding more wages 

42.83 50.39 A: well um i guess i i've felt that uh when you're making that type of money i guess i'm i'm always gonna feel like um 

50.62 54.47 A: you know just shut up and and play i guess i don't i don't know uh 

55.06 63.62 A: [sigh] i guess they look at it differently but i guess from my point of view i've always looked at it as you know when when you're making millions of dollars i don't understand wh- what really beef you you really can have 

63.41 70.92 A: you know what i mean like you're being mistreated so i guess the recent strikes have kinda turned me off sometimes to to some of the athletes and some of the sports 

71.38 75.64 B: yeah me too because i feel like that they're not representing 

75.67 81.82 B: uh you know their they're not representing the the main th- because amer- 

81.85 87.01 B: uh baseball and all that is a- all american you know what i mean they're supposed to be representing 

84.84 86.12 A: right right 

87.20 93.34 B: the sport and they're supposed to be playing it for the love of the game i mean that's the way i always was uh told that 

93.47 97.79 B: you know even if they didn't get paid uh you know that much 

97.96 103.79 B: but man they get millions and millions of dollars i agree with you you you put it really well 

101.57 102.53 A: right 

103.42 112.73 A: so i think that um [lipsmack] and she said also the recording said do you think that they deserve it i guess i i don't know if anyone deserves that amount of money but because 

112.76 121.77 A: [mn] the market kinda demands it i guess they're entitled to it because their owners i mean they're making so much more than the athletes are are making if they're paying that type of salary 

121.61 123.47 B: right well i 

122.07 123.40 A: so i guess if you 

123.61 128.28 B: (( yeah and i i i agree with you but i you know it would be nice though if if they )) 

128.22 134.62 B: would roll the prices back i mean i've i've heard i mean i haven't went to a game in a long time but my son 

134.53 145.53 B: he bought some tickets and and and he told me to get the seats he wanted um you know i don't know if he was you know bought 'em um i- b- but he told me he had to pay a couple of hundred dollars for 'em 

144.95 154.26 A: yeah i bet yeah it's ridiculous you said you were in south carolina oh okay so do you you guess you know what's the closest like professional teams near you 

146.63 147.86 B: (( yeah )) 

149.11 150.13 B: yeah 

154.86 160.72 B: well i'm not really uh into sports that much but you know i like my son is so he would 

159.49 160.62 A: oh okay 

160.88 164.55 B: yeah but you you know um a lot of times uh 

164.71 172.98 B: you know i- i'll listen to and read um articles about you know different peop- um different you know people and their salary demands and stuff 

172.34 173.66 A: right right 

173.02 173.88 B: and um 

173.84 184.29 B: just not only of sports but just like uh people that are in corporations and stuff and and they got people working on them making like you know maybe twenty thousand a year and yet they 

184.28 193.06 B: they the executives make four or five million dollars you know i i just think there should be some kinda way to weigh things to where 

187.70 188.54 A: right 

192.91 203.58 B: no one ha- because there's overkill i mean once you've got fifty or sixty million dollars i mean you know that's it just i don't know there's there's got to be a line somewhere 

202.75 216.84 A: right right 'cause i i still don't really understand like uh [sigh] i guess there's a demand for st- sports and everybody you know a lot of people do like sports and wanna follow them [sigh] but there's a lot of people who don't go to games you know who just sit home and watch it on t._v. 

216.91 218.71 B: right that's true 

217.31 221.58 A: so i guess a lot of the money is generated from the t._v. stations you know 

220.57 222.99 B: yeah selling the ads and stuff 

221.71 228.33 A: right selling ad time which i always you know it's like you're selling the ad time but no one's actually buying a product like they're 

228.39 240.75 A: you know if i love sports and i only i never go to games and i just sit home and watch it on t._v. i guess they're thinking that they're they're going to advertise to me and i'm going to spend my money that way that the advertisers feel like they're gonna get me to buy something but uh 

240.99 247.63 A: i don't even know how effective that is i know that i watch the games but when the commercials are on i leave and go do other things so 

246.90 257.73 B: [laughter] yeah i do too try to time it but only um or even if you're recording a lot of times you try to pau- pause it when the commercials so you don't have to replace your tape 

247.73 248.82 A: [laughter] 

254.52 255.65 A: right 

255.71 256.91 A: right 

257.26 272.09 A: and and fast forward it and everything right because i- i- it only seems like a handful of uh sports where the peop- the athletes actually strike often which is always you know i guess puzzling to me like uh [sigh] your professional teams will strike 

259.18 261.48 B: yeah that's right 

272.18 274.08 A: but then i guess the individuals 

274.65 280.67 A: i guess they don't i i don't know what the difference is why they don't have a reason to strike like your tennis players or golfers or 

280.87 284.19 A: you know people in sports like that they uh they just keep playing 

284.26 285.36 B: yeah i know 

285.13 298.40 B: and you know what else too when they when um baseball goes on strike a lot of people just swear that they're they're just gonna quit going i mean they're really in the long run they're gonna hurt themself because in the long run people like the uh 

291.99 292.93 A: right 

298.18 305.98 B: [cough] audience is gonna decline to such a point that they won't even be able to ask for no salary increases they they need to be 

306.00 309.80 B: they might have to be asked to give a salary cut because uh 

309.82 315.24 B: you know they don't have the fans there no more because people don't wanna think it's just about a dollar 

314.57 315.79 A: right 

315.36 327.97 B: you know i mean i they don't want to think that that you're just going there for a money grubbing people that watch them play because you got troubles in your own life and you go there for uh uh you know like and then plus 

328.04 329.87 B: charging like uh 

330.02 335.96 B: the m- for the food and stuff when you go there you're gonna pay for a high price ticket and then you've got to pay outrageous 

336.41 338.41 B: money for the food and everything 

337.35 341.21 A: [noise] right yeah exactly which is out of overpriced also 

341.23 345.85 A: um you know i saw something about [sigh] i think i was reading in the paper the other day 

345.87 359.15 A: something about the w._m._b._a. um their players union having talks whether or not they were gonna continue playing and i thought to myself wow they they seem to be struggling the women's basketball is struggling to even draw fans and just 

359.42 373.60 A: being introduced and already talking about [sigh] um what they would need to extend their contract so they wouldn't have a work stoppage and i thought they had to be kidding me i was like i know that a sport like a sport like that would never survive if they went [laughter] on strike 

373.53 377.59 B: yeah i know i- if if i guess its just human nature to 

376.95 378.25 A: right 

377.66 384.81 B: always want more 'cause i i remember one time and this is i thought this was shocking there was a a show on millionaires 

384.30 385.21 A: uh-huh 

384.74 393.45 B: and this guy was talking about when he he said all he wanted to do was earn that first million and he was gonna be satisfied but he said once he got the first million 

392.94 394.04 A: right 

393.43 400.30 B: then he had to have the second and then when he got the second he wanted the third he said you don't never stop wanting more money he 

400.01 401.24 A: right 

400.61 403.11 B: said it just becomes an obsession 

402.78 408.74 A: right yeah i see i see how they are and uh i guess they once the athletes get [sigh] 

404.24 405.19 B: (( you know )) 

408.60 410.29 A: to a certain um 

410.27 423.83 A: level or get accustomed to certain things and then they they feel like they always have to have that or sometimes their argument would be that uh well we deserve this money because um we only can do this for a certain amount of time so this money has to last us a lifetime 

423.12 427.75 B: (( yeah well if they only got two hundred million they should be able to [laughter] make that last )) 

425.59 429.20 A: [laughter] right yeah that's what i thought too you know 

428.47 434.93 B: and then another thing too they probably look at the pie 'cause you were talking about how the uh owners get so much more 

434.25 435.56 A: right right 

434.84 449.00 B: they probably look over at the pie and they say well even though we're getting you know fifty million dollars a game or something like that or or two million a game or whatever they're saying well but you know they're looking that that's only a little small portion of the pie 

449.08 451.15 B: you know that's probably that they're thinking 

450.91 452.24 A: (( [noise] right )) 

451.53 460.60 B: it's not fair but what they should do if the pie is that big they should just give the customer some relief as far as the ticket prices and stuff 

460.05 467.03 A: right yeah 'cause owners created this this monster with the athletes i mean you know and they continue just to pay more and more 

461.19 462.20 B: (( that's the )) 

467.16 475.32 A: just to compete for for these players you know if someone could have any- you know at some point put their foot down and said look [mn] i'm not paying you know more than this 

475.66 479.20 A: you know for a certain player i mean it happens in regular um 

479.24 482.49 A: work industries where you know they won't pay more than a certain 

482.89 490.42 A: you know a top dollar for a certain person like you know everyday work person you'll go to a job and they'll say well look this is what we pay you know either take it or leave it [sigh] 

490.22 499.94 A: but uh i guess in for sports that the owners feel like oh well if i don't get this particular person i won't and people aren't going to follow me or follow my team the way uh 

500.10 501.65 A: they would with other teams 

501.64 514.74 B: right and probably another thing too is that other players you know that you know they see another player getting so much and they think that they're hey i'm just as good as him how come he gets you know two hundred thousand more than me 

511.68 512.85 A: right 

514.19 515.66 A: right 

515.12 516.58 B: (( there's probably a lot of a )) 

516.59 520.11 B: lot of human nature in there in in that 

518.45 532.52 A: right yeah like you said earlier though you'd think that after a certain point you could just play because you love it i mean i know michael jordan for years played well below market value because he felt like well millions of dollars is enough and then i can just play 'cause i love the sport 

532.41 536.04 B: yeah i heard something about him in the news the other day it 

536.61 541.38 B: it said something about he w- he thought he he uh he got back into basketball right 

540.77 544.26 A: yeah he just playing again the last couple of years and now he 

543.52 546.69 B: yeah they said he's retiring [laughter] again but 

544.89 547.26 A: yeah he's gonna stop again yeah 

546.76 548.91 B: yeah but this time it's gonna be for good yeah 

548.22 555.73 A: right yeah you would think so but yeah 'cause even this second either the first or second he donated his whole salary his whole year's salary to charity 

554.97 559.24 B: yeah i think he's a good guy i really i admire him i mean that's one 

558.16 559.00 A: right 

559.50 561.50 B: you know he's always uh 

561.52 564.41 B: seemed like a good natured person you never 

564.74 568.68 B: you know never hear nothing um i know he had a gambling problem 

567.90 569.86 A: right right right 

569.29 572.09 B: you know that he had a problem with that but you know 

572.37 573.62 B: i guess that happen- 

573.65 579.18 B: um happens to everybody i mean if i had a lot of money i [laughter] i probably would be a gambler i'd be down a lot 

577.87 580.02 A: yeah or something yeah [laughter] 

579.60 584.32 B: yeah i guess you know you wanna yeah i don't know use when you've got all that free time you 

584.41 587.06 B: you try to get excitement any way you can 

586.34 595.19 A: right right yeah i guess he was compete- competed uh a lot and then needed something else to fill that void when he wasn't playing 

594.17 598.38 B: yeah yeah you do you remember will smith i think uh that played on 

597.27 598.27 A: yeah 

598.60 599.89 B: i i i heard
