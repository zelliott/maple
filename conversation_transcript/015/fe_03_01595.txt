0.06 2.17 B: would you hold on one second please 

1.99 3.00 A: sure 

2.40 3.86 B: i got a call 

13.32 14.08 B: hello 

14.27 15.93 A: yeah 

14.84 16.20 B: yeah mario 

16.23 18.10 A: hey i'm john how are you doing 

17.53 20.84 B: i'm doing all right so do you feel um 

20.90 25.43 B: airport security lessens the chance of terrorism 

25.55 27.32 A: absolutely not 

27.45 28.72 A: how about yourself 

28.88 38.96 B: ah it's hard to say i mean i think it's a deterrent i mean i think if a person's determined to do something they're going to do it no matter what or find a way to 

39.19 48.06 B: but it is a deterrent for a copycat per se or suicide person that just wants to make a name for himself 

48.39 50.79 B: you know because it's harder to get through 

50.86 55.44 B: i mean i went to the airport the other day it was like good lord 

55.54 59.17 B: i mean it took us almost three hours just in a line 

59.70 62.43 B: (( and then they want to check everything )) 

62.32 64.05 A: [laughter] what airport was that 

63.45 66.48 B: um hartsfield right here in atlanta 

66.07 67.88 A: oh yeah i know it well 

67.86 70.24 B: yeah 

69.10 74.95 A: yeah well i i see i have a different perspective i'm an airline pilot so 

73.96 75.10 B: okay 

75.34 84.99 A: um i personally feel if anybody's going to go through security they can easily get through with no with no hassles at all it's it's more for um 

85.38 93.43 A: ah public's eye i mean i know so many different holes it's frigging ridiculous the rampers don't go through security the 

93.55 108.46 A: catering don't go through security gate agents don't go through security and m- many of those are first you know entry level jobs they they ah start out at minimum wage so if somebody wanted to do a terrorist attack all they got to do is buy 'em off 

108.53 110.43 B: okay that's true 

110.63 123.73 A: so i mean ah it it might be good to have security going through a point you know obviously going through the screen process but so many people don't go through that process it's it's worthless 

123.86 127.69 B: okay how about with the marshals they got on the plane 

127.96 137.61 A: oh well th- i i think that's pretty good i mean obviously somebody with a loaded gun is going to be pretty much stopped anything don't you think but that's only a percentage of the flights remember 

134.06 135.61 B: yeah 

137.33 138.48 B: okay 

138.37 139.86 A: it's hit and miss 

139.48 141.24 B: yeah it's random 

142.57 145.70 B: yeah you're right about that never looked at it that way 

145.68 147.07 A: yeah i 

146.01 152.77 B: i thought everybody was checked i i i didn't assume i assumed that they did background checks for everybody 

152.88 164.07 A: well they do background checks i mean that's the thing but you know background checks are just background checks you can't tell what's what's going through somebody's mind you know and the and the funny thing is about the 

164.08 166.49 A: hijacking that happened on nine eleven 

166.41 167.28 B: okay 

166.60 171.90 A: as the as the people who went through um ah portland airport 

172.30 175.74 A: they they brought through box cutters which were perfectly legal 

175.53 183.74 B: right right i mean yeah i mean there's always ways to get weapons on even with what they got because they make non metallic weapons 

183.43 184.70 A: oh of course 

183.80 186.22 B: you know resin type weapons 

186.28 199.45 B: matter of fact i sell security equipment i sell stun guns and i sell resin ah knives and stuff like that i even se- i used to sell plastic guns that actually take 

199.46 207.70 B: they take a plastic bullet which is fired with um air cylinder but the bullet itself is lethal you 

207.71 209.35 A: right 

208.47 211.12 B: know so yeah 

209.48 214.02 A: sort of like sort of like a ah c._o. two ah cartridge right 

213.11 214.23 B: (( uh-huh )) 

214.86 217.14 A: yeah so 

216.15 217.07 B: (( you know )) 

218.18 229.91 B: [mn] and that's the only thing that is is detectable and those once you separate 'em from the actual thing you know t- well what do you use this for you can come up with nine thousand reasons why you use them 

229.54 231.45 A: oh yeah 

230.31 236.40 B: you know you can buy ah they have survival equipment that takes those 

236.46 242.30 B: in replace of electrical stuff and everything else so that yeah you're right there's always a way to get 

242.49 244.43 B: something through somewhere 

244.41 247.41 A: yeah i mean if there's a will there's a way you know and 

247.62 248.34 A: ah 

248.99 253.51 A: by all means it probably keep the majority of the people who 

253.57 256.26 A: you know are just plain idiots 

256.14 263.85 B: so basically all it's doing all terrorism is doing and all this security is keeping people from going to the airport all together 

264.36 268.76 A: well you know ah i wouldn't really say that 

267.75 273.32 B: because see out out of ten people i know most of 'em will not fly since nine eleven 

274.04 276.62 A: strictly because of ah the terrorism 

275.33 290.12 B: simply because of yeah because of that and the fact that all the hassles you got to go through just to go to the airport and everything but like i tell people you got to go through the same hassles at amtrak and at the greyhound station 

290.43 293.15 A: oh yeah i mean it it's 

293.32 300.35 A: pretty much ridiculous i mean the majority of the people that that ah that need to fly will fly you know 

300.35 307.01 A: tickets are getting cheaper i think more and more people are coming back but i think right now the biggest deterrent is probably the sars 

307.01 316.10 A: i know a lot of people are staying away from airports just because you get you can get people coming in from hong kong and on beijing and all that they're afraid to catch a you know lethal disease [noise] 

313.30 314.78 B: (( mhm )) 

318.25 319.81 B: (( what are you looking for )) 

321.67 326.29 B: (( [noise] could you hold on just a second how did you get in the back )) 

323.88 325.15 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

326.83 328.22 B: (( door )) 

329.20 331.37 B: okay go ahead sorry about that 

330.79 335.60 A: oh yeah no problem i mean i i just have a different take on it i mean 

334.89 336.38 B: let me hear your take 

337.14 342.06 A: on ah security in in deterring um 

342.38 350.07 A: terrorism i just think that a lot of it's show and i mean there there's really nothing anybody can do 

350.11 351.18 A: i mean 

351.97 357.54 A: it pr- it probably makes it more difficult it keeps the low level um 

357.79 368.90 A: ah terrorist or the basically the idiots from doing something bringing something on the airplane but you know if somebody is determined to do it you know like like you're saying somebody can make resin gun you know 

368.80 375.55 A: take an epoxy mixture make a gun out of it you know ah and then they can get it on so 

372.36 373.61 B: uh-huh 

375.70 376.85 A: i don't know 

377.98 379.04 A: that's 

379.20 383.83 A: you know it's just interesting to see what other people think about it 

383.80 386.80 B: (( yeah i have to agree )) 

385.40 388.85 A: i mean do you honestly feel safe safer going to the airport 

388.31 402.31 B: well it doesn't bother me i mean my my my my thing is if you're going to go you're going to go i mean you know if it's your time it's your time no matter where you're at so i'm not going to let something like that you know the fact that somebody might blow up the plane or 

397.12 398.43 A: exactly 

402.13 415.26 B: have ah or crash into a building with the plane or whatever if if i'm on a plane and that happens you know and i can't do nothing to stop it then it's my time it's my time you know i just hope i have everything in order when i go 

415.55 419.75 A: [laughter] yeah yeah that's pretty much it you know you get 

417.82 432.81 B: you know i don't i don't worry about things like that you know to me there's just as much terrorism here in america in itself without me having to worry about those on the outside of the country coming in 

433.05 434.08 B: (( you know )) 

434.71 440.96 B: because if you look at the timothy mcveigh thing i mean as he was put to death for it but 

441.02 444.22 B: i mean i personally don't believe he did it alone 

444.81 448.30 B: [lipsmack] and what about those that they they didn't catch 

448.54 450.07 A: oh right yeah 

449.49 456.03 B: you know who's to say that they're not just like the people with the [lipsmack] um what is that the anthrax 

456.13 458.34 B: i'm sure they might have caught one or two 

458.46 460.72 B: but what about the ring leaders you 

461.16 462.05 B: know 

462.51 465.02 B: i think they should concentrate more on 

465.27 469.11 B: terrorism within the united states from 

469.27 470.81 B: people that are born here 

471.01 472.02 A: right 

471.47 477.71 B: that have gripes with the government before they start going around looking for all these terrorists in the world because [lipsmack] 

477.72 482.77 B: you're looking in your neighbourhood and everybody el- you know you've got terrorists in your own backyard 

483.28 487.91 B: [lipsmack] you know [mn] there's an old saying you've got to clean up your house before you tell somebody else how to clean up theirs 

488.46 492.79 A: yeah do you do you think there's more terrorists in the united states than there are ah 

492.90 494.42 A: outside 

493.82 494.96 B: sure i do 

495.80 496.44 A: (( oh )) 

495.93 501.13 B: i deal with them every day when i deal with these gang members around here to me that's a form of terrorists 

501.05 503.26 A: right yeah that's a good point 

502.70 507.77 B: you know that's they're a threat to my existence to my family's existence 

507.80 509.66 A: mhm 

508.69 512.93 B: you know racism that's a that's a terroristic act 

513.33 514.33 A: (( yeah i know )) 

514.38 515.09 B: (( you know )) 

515.32 516.17 B: (( [mn] )) 

517.41 519.20 B: i mean you can't go freely 

519.24 529.74 B: and be who you are or what you're into because somebody has got a problem with it that's a terroristic act you know a person gets assaulted in the street [mn] 

530.09 532.88 B: because he's white or because he's black [lipsmack] 

533.00 539.87 B: or because he's straight or because he's gay or whatever that's a terroristic act it depends on how you look at it you 

537.60 538.51 A: mhm 

539.71 543.62 A: (( oh yeah oh yeah i can definitely see that )) 

540.96 541.95 B: (( know [mn] )) 

543.86 552.80 B: and whether it's done by an average citizen or the police police can be terrorists at times [mn] you know not all of 'em but some of 'em 

552.37 554.73 A: oh yeah there's bad apples in every group 

553.57 555.81 B: you know sure there is 

556.00 563.69 B: so i think that they're doing the best they can with the actual airport security i think they go a little overboard sometimes individually 

564.24 565.40 B: (( [lipsmack] you know )) 

565.92 571.77 B: like that guy they arrested because he made somebody heard him make a statement to his wife or whatever 

572.08 577.01 B: i think some people go a little bit overboard with how they perceive terrorism 

577.13 578.98 A: mhm 

578.42 580.55 B: you know but 

580.85 581.41 B: (( [mn] )) 

582.52 585.13 B: i think it's as good as they can get it 

585.36 594.84 A: yeah i mean it's it's a knee jerk and all a bit of a band aid for the situation but i mean like you said it's it's the best they can probably do at this point 

594.97 599.89 A: and does it really solve the problem probably not i think the majority of the people understand that too
