1.10 3.14 A: hello this is tina 

3.17 5.08 B: hi tina this is rahod 

5.44 6.49 A: okay 

7.59 10.28 A: did you um get the topic 

9.97 15.29 B: uh yeah i think it was about uh recent strike by professional athletes 

15.51 17.98 A: strikes by professional actors 

17.59 21.64 B: athletes i think that was it did did you hear something else 

21.43 24.86 A: no that's what i thought i heard [laughter] 

24.53 29.08 B: recent strike by professional athletes that's what i think i heard 

28.92 29.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

29.57 31.12 B: is that what you heard 

30.90 32.25 A: yes 

33.00 34.01 B: so 

34.40 36.54 B: what's your opinion on that 

36.63 38.62 B: i i'm by the way 

38.95 40.85 B: live in atlanta how about you 

40.94 43.13 A: um i live in atlanta 

43.15 44.14 B: uh-huh 

43.55 49.13 A: well i live outside of atlanta in the suburbs but basically yes i live in the atlanta area 

49.89 51.03 A: um 

51.33 52.97 A: how long have you lived here 

52.69 55.00 B: actually i've just moved from boston 

54.63 57.36 A: oh okay i i've been here about two years 

57.20 58.52 B: (( i live in the )) 

57.70 59.47 A: well um 

59.61 64.11 A: strikes by professional actors is that what it is 

64.31 65.86 B: (( athletes [laughter] )) 

65.52 68.70 A: athletes oh i think it's stupid 

69.29 82.40 A: [laughter] because they already get paid a lot of money they get paid more than most people do in a year and they should accept what they get now and i don't think it really is necessary for them 

82.54 86.11 A: to complain about not getting enough money 

86.68 88.12 A: (( 'cause )) 

86.72 88.75 B: my my opinion is 

89.06 94.74 B: same but slightly different like i think we shouldn't generalize this just because they're paid highly 

92.57 93.46 A: uh-huh 

94.88 95.84 A: mhm 

95.09 99.80 B: i think like every other profession like even if somebody gets paid less or more 

99.22 100.41 A: like teaching 

100.42 101.53 B: yeah that's 

101.70 103.97 B: hey you must be a teacher [laughter] are you 

103.00 105.89 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

104.55 110.39 B: okay what i mean to say is that regardless of the profession and regardless of how much you get paid 

110.08 111.11 A: (( yes )) 

110.50 113.67 B: if there is something unfair you should be allowed to 

113.88 119.34 B: strike just because you are paid highly you can take the example of some let's say scientist who is 

119.49 127.05 B: working his like whole life to do something very noble and something and he gets paid very highly for his efforts 

126.59 127.76 A: mhm 

127.14 129.39 B: and he gets some unfair treatment 

129.44 132.07 B: and the union of scientists decides to 

132.43 143.94 B: make strike that they shouldn't like for example it shouldn't interfere with their work so much and things like that so according to this logic you will say that because they are paid highly they shouldn't strike 

137.00 137.93 A: mhm 

145.01 145.88 B: so 

146.19 148.16 B: so that's where i differ i think 

149.12 150.00 A: well 

149.21 155.81 B: whether whether they should be allowed to strike or not or whether it is right or wrong should really depend on the causes of the strike 

150.09 150.80 A: (( [mn] )) 

152.86 153.96 A: (( mhm )) 

156.44 166.77 A: well they should be allowed to strike if their working conditions are poor and for other conditions but i really do feel that professional athletes 

167.26 168.57 A: um 

168.68 175.11 A: already get a sufficient amount of money when you compare the salaries of an average citizen 

175.21 183.54 A: um they get more just to entertain us and they really don't need i feel they really don't need no more i mean 

183.47 187.36 B: yeah that that's if they are striking because of working conditions 

187.09 192.82 A: if they're striking because of working conditions that's great that that's fine 

193.40 197.43 A: everybody can use some improvement in their working conditions 

197.85 199.30 B: yeah and secondly 

198.33 199.94 A: well however 

200.50 202.86 A: however it you don't like your profession 

202.89 209.01 A: get out let somebody else have an opportunity 'cause there's always somebody waiting to do what they're doing 

208.65 215.03 B: what if somebody applies this logic to a teacher's union striking on something that hey if you don't like just get out mhm 

214.28 222.87 A: get out i app- i believe the same thing if you don't like what you're doing you don't like the working conditions then maybe you should choose a different 

220.38 225.94 B: so so in that case basically your reasoning has nothing to do with professional athletes 

226.20 229.68 B: you are simply saying if somebody is not happy just leave it 

229.15 232.97 A: mm yeah leave i mean life about choices 

230.35 234.23 B: so that is a applicable to teachers everywhere 

233.95 239.89 A: yeah it it it applies to everyone if you don't like what you're doing then you need to 

239.94 241.71 A: get out and try some dif- 

240.16 249.76 B: that's a that's a very simplified approach i would say i mean you may like a profession you may want to be successful in that and you have real qualifications for that 

249.47 250.67 A: mhm 

250.02 254.18 B: but but it may be that some things are wrong in that profession 

254.16 255.26 A: yes 

254.19 255.85 B: and to protest that 

256.06 259.41 B: strike is uh is like a peaceful way in a democracy 

260.06 261.07 B: so 

261.64 266.87 B: not taking that right away from you and telling you that hey if you don't like get out i think 

267.16 270.13 B: i think that that's the most simplified approach [laughter] 

267.26 273.28 A: yeah i think so [laughter] [laughter] i think so i mean you know 

272.23 277.66 B: let me give you an example of nurses you are a teacher so maybe you will relate because my wife is a nurse 

277.63 281.15 A: uh-huh oh yeah [laughter] another profession 

278.20 279.03 B: (( so )) 

279.55 281.35 B: (( because they're also )) 

281.70 285.74 B: like a profession where it's mostly dominated by women and 

284.82 286.43 A: mhm 

285.99 288.72 B: so there are some conditions which are bad and all 

288.11 296.77 A: yes and in in that in that situation where we need nurses and teachers i think people do need to come together and try to change 

297.29 301.97 A: if it do strike if strikes help change the profession then 

297.47 298.59 B: so why not 

302.41 304.35 A: you know i'm all for that 

302.58 307.57 B: so but you're logic will say that hey don't like it leave it and go do something else 

307.38 313.50 A: [laughter] yeah it is but we but for for a critical profession like teaching and nursing 

308.06 309.48 B: but i would say no 

313.52 318.09 A: um you know we want people to go in those professions so 

318.19 320.38 B: i would i would like to change 

318.61 322.32 A: they need to get together and try to change that situation 

322.03 324.56 B: i would like to change little bit 

324.93 328.37 B: how you think about athletes or any celebrities 

328.43 342.96 B: and that that is that don't just think that they're earning millions of dollars like first of all i'm nowhere near that profession so i have not personal interest there but they generate that it is basically an income generating profession 

342.97 345.89 A: yes but i think for professional athletes 

346.35 350.40 B: they've got a lot of money but because of that a lot of jobs are created 

346.58 349.17 A: they have no right to complain [laughter] 

350.33 351.11 A: [mn] 

350.56 353.02 B: millions of people working in that industry 

351.92 361.21 A: i don't have any sympathy for them [laughter] they get so many privileges you know their profession cannot be as bad as nursing or teaching 

360.66 366.74 B: no that that's true but that's that's not a yardstick i'd like like that you can say about nursing also that 

361.35 362.85 A: [laughter] 

366.97 372.30 B: don't strike there are professions which are even worse look at construction workers or look at mining workers 

371.37 372.85 A: yes 

372.66 376.36 B: no so that's where only the lowest common denominator can strike [laughter] 

372.87 374.48 A: please yes 

375.45 378.39 A: yeah look at the police [laughter] 

378.89 389.15 A: you can say that that's why i'm saying you know uh professional athletes they they're a privileged group 'cause very few people get to become professional athletes 

388.59 391.27 B: and do you think they just become like that i think 

390.55 397.60 A: no there's you you know very few make it to the top i don't know what's the percentage one percent two percent 

391.32 392.81 B: they have they 

397.43 400.01 B: not even that just one person pitch 

397.74 399.52 A: of all athletes 

401.06 403.11 A: so you know 

402.28 405.81 B: so they have worked hard for it and sure 

406.27 409.88 B: now now they're in that position so they're reaping the returns like 

410.12 412.48 B: if there is some unfair treatment 

412.88 415.01 B: i think they should be allowed to protest it 

414.55 420.37 A: they're entertainers get over it [laughter] no they shouldn't strike [laughter] 

418.56 419.29 B: (( well )) 

419.61 422.69 B: i guess that's why this discussion that everyone can have their opinions 

422.04 428.71 A: [laughter] i mean they're they're just given too much as it is i feel you know [laughter] 

427.82 436.20 B: well you know uh what tina uh i mean i have migrated to america so i've learned the thinking here 

434.35 435.34 A: uh-huh 

436.27 440.64 B: but this kind of uh thinking is more in socialist countries and all 

440.81 442.60 B: and because of that thinking 

442.66 443.65 B: they don't 

443.66 447.60 B: they don't rise i mean here it's like competition be the best you can 

447.65 448.93 A: yes 

447.69 448.56 B: and 

448.72 456.26 B: and you will the best rewards you don't have to be somebody rich or something you're a teacher so you will understand this concept anybody can be anything 

450.30 451.09 A: (( yes )) 

452.82 453.66 A: right 

456.17 458.06 A: yeah anybody can do anything 

457.31 458.87 B: in many countries 

458.94 464.94 B: the leader of the count- if you have to become the leader of that country you have to be born in some of those family or something like that 

464.75 467.04 A: oh yes that's true 

465.61 469.57 B: but but here you can be a farmer's son and you can become the president 

467.37 471.70 A: but here mhm anybody can be anything [laughter] 

470.05 470.77 B: (( yeah )) 

471.08 473.96 B: so so sure if you have this talent 

474.06 478.08 B: and you are reaping the rewards that's great i mean sure we can be 

477.37 479.11 A: yes mhm 

478.29 486.60 B: sure we can be also that hey that guy's making millions and millions but ultimately that person somehow deserved it 

486.71 490.23 B: and regardless of the fact how much that person is making 

488.95 491.01 A: yes you're you're right 

490.57 493.07 B: i think if that person is treated unfairly 

493.14 495.49 B: he has the same rights as a poor person 

495.73 496.98 B: because you cannot mhm 

495.99 510.17 A: but a lot of times when they're when professional athletes strike they're not striking because they're being treated unfairly they're they're striking because they want a free agent uh or they want more pay 

502.44 504.94 B: exactly that's why i say that reason 

510.45 516.02 B: well if they are striking unfairly then i'm sure like somebody can say hey get out 

516.56 521.99 B: so again it's the reasons of the strike that are more important than who is striking 

522.67 525.19 B: so otherwise it would be a reverse discrimination 

525.31 530.41 B: when we talk about nurses and teachers we are sympathetic but when we talk about celebrities 

527.31 528.36 A: mhm 

530.96 533.27 B: we say hey they make a lot of money let's 

533.48 535.15 B: not give them any more [laughter] 

534.74 539.36 A: [laughter] but they do [laughter] 

535.27 536.23 B: well 

536.28 540.97 B: i can understand that i can understand that but that would be a reverse discrimination 

540.24 546.92 A: this is it's terrible how this society uh values certain professions more than others you know 

548.47 549.59 B: (( but )) 

549.86 550.98 A: [mn] 

550.45 554.50 B: everyone strives to be in their shoes so if you make that 

554.75 559.04 B: profession ugly if you take all the privileges away from that profession then nobody will 

559.40 566.67 B: try to reach those heights so again my opinion is it depends because i am not i guess the topic was the recent strike 

566.18 567.17 A: mhm 

566.85 568.21 B: so i think 

568.34 576.01 B: i'm not exactly familiar with what was the reasons probably something like as you are saying they wanted a free agent or whatever [laughter] so again 

570.85 571.84 A: (( [laughter] )) 

574.39 583.94 A: yeah well i'm i'm thinking about the baseball strike that they had i don't know a year two years ago three years ago and they didn't play [laughter] baseball 

582.81 585.70 B: mhm you know it's not only the players who are making money 

585.34 586.44 A: mhm 

585.81 591.78 B: players are working for a club the club is owned by somebody who is making perhaps like uh millions and billions 

590.60 591.39 A: (( mm )) 

591.87 592.84 B: so 

592.13 594.28 A: who's making money off of them yes 

593.25 597.56 B: yeah so players are technically employees of that club they work for a boss 

597.78 599.01 B: so
