5.51 7.01 A: i'm good how are you 

6.97 13.66 B: good i had a little trouble understanding are we discussing the pay of athletes 

13.41 18.91 A: yeah i believe that's what it is if we think that they [sigh] um [lipsmack] deserve the salaries that they receive [noise] 

19.57 21.65 A: i believe is what it was [sigh] 

21.32 24.72 B: oh okay well i don't think they do do you 

22.62 23.65 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

23.86 26.68 A: i don't either no [laughter] 

24.99 31.11 B: [laughter] i think it's glorified and way too much 

29.65 30.25 A: (( [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

30.55 37.63 A: yes if i was an athlete i might feel a little differently um but as a solely as a source of entertainment i would say that that's a little steep 

38.31 40.20 A: [sigh] considering there's 

40.31 41.97 A: you know starving kids 

43.11 48.42 A: that can't eat and we're all spending ninety a hundred dollars on a ticket to go to a baseball game 

48.69 50.14 B: right right 

50.55 59.53 B: well it started out it's supposed to be a fun sport you know for people to go watch and it's crazy what it costs to go watch now and stuff 

58.56 60.46 A: right right 

59.59 61.93 B: (( just the um the average )) 

63.04 69.41 B: single mom that's got several kids can't allow herself and the kids to go 'cause she can't afford it 

69.24 70.11 A: right 

69.55 70.38 B: (( you know )) 

70.44 75.43 B: and that's not fair i don't think and then the athletes um 

71.52 72.88 A: (( no it's not )) 

77.26 82.61 B: [sigh] i don't know their wild hair do's and their tattoos and and 

80.50 81.33 A: (( [sigh] )) 

81.43 85.25 A: and they're on the travel channel as going to vegas all the time [laughter] 

84.02 88.33 B: th- yeah you know and and i don't know um 

88.62 91.37 B: [lipsmack] these are the idols our kids look up to 

91.47 92.96 A: right well [noise] 

91.59 93.17 B: when they're young [noise] 

93.45 95.17 A: (( yeah it would )) 

95.83 100.13 A: i guess it's not bad to idolize w- wanting to make that much money one day but 

102.00 106.69 A: but to maybe idolize the way that the money is used [sigh] that's just like 

105.38 106.80 B: right right 

107.10 110.27 B: exactly you sound out of breath 

107.68 108.92 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

109.93 114.75 A: that's 'cause i'm running [laughter] i was i was just i was just up and down like two flights of stairs while i was on the phone 

114.58 116.96 B: oh okay 

114.93 116.28 A: [laughter] 

116.52 117.95 A: (( i was doing laundry )) 

118.46 119.75 B: i see 

119.27 121.39 A: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

121.83 123.78 A: so yes i was out of breath but now i'm sitting 

121.92 122.83 B: (( [noise] so )) 

125.57 126.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

126.00 128.25 B: (( well i don't know i i feel )) 

128.34 129.35 B: um 

130.69 137.10 B: some of the sports are dangerous but that's what they chose to get into and evidently they got into it 'cause they liked it 

137.43 140.04 A: right right like like uh boxing 

137.50 138.46 B: (( you know )) 

140.32 141.28 B: uh-huh 

141.51 142.34 A: um 

141.56 143.33 B: (( exactly [noise] )) 

142.63 148.45 A: oh that and that was actually one of the things that i would say like with um [lipsmack] you know they they they bid 

148.50 153.55 A: to [noise] to draft certain athletes but boxing is one of the sports where um 

153.65 156.38 A: they actually are paid to lose [sigh] [mn] 

156.07 157.50 B: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

157.46 158.32 A: so 

158.69 168.47 A: you could actually spend the money to go to a fight and irregardless of you know depending on what round they [mn] go down in d- determines the amount of money they make and [lipsmack] 

168.28 175.49 A: you know what i mean you could go and spend x. amount of dollars for tickets and then the [noise] you're you're you 

175.60 178.09 A: you've spent the money irregardless of how long you're 

178.20 180.34 A: how long the fight lasts or 

181.20 183.81 A: and then to do the pay review and [sigh] 

183.99 184.55 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

184.71 186.85 B: and wrestling that's a joke 

186.33 190.79 A: yeah that's well that's t- that is solely entertainment i would 

190.50 191.81 B: [laughter] 

190.81 192.76 A: (( i would assume [laughter] )) 

192.03 192.90 B: (( yes )) 

193.30 195.73 A: (( i don't think that they're truly wrestling )) 

193.40 194.27 B: yeah 

196.99 203.28 A: [lipsmack] uh yes i think it's it's ridiculous there's a lot of other places [lipsmack] where that money could go 

203.48 205.33 B: well my oldest son 

205.14 206.59 A: mhm 

205.96 212.79 B: he was very very talented and he was like top in basketball and top in baseball 

207.55 208.51 A: mhm 

212.44 213.73 A: mhm 

213.12 217.50 B: and it went to his head i mean he was always first picked every season and everything 

217.30 218.45 A: right 

217.83 220.94 B: and so he was going 

221.25 222.88 B: to be an athlete 

222.72 223.70 A: uh-huh 

223.89 228.20 B: and as long as you're an athlete you don't have to learn 

228.33 230.35 A: right right [laughter] 

230.07 234.40 B: they let you slide he is one of the dumbest kids i've ever seen

234.87 237.18 B: (( yeah you know and [cough] )) 

237.35 242.72 B: he didn't become an athlete because he he wouldn't have cut it in college you know 

242.29 243.18 A: right 

243.01 244.04 B: um 

244.15 246.49 B: and i it's just so sad 

246.37 247.62 A: that is sad 

246.77 253.74 B: [cough] how many of these athletes really are not very intelligent some of 'em couldn't even read and write 

253.30 254.64 A: right 

253.80 256.29 B: at through the school on their talents 

256.08 257.02 A: yeah 

256.48 258.65 B: and other people doing their schoolwork [lipsmack] 

259.53 260.83 B: and uh 

261.60 263.55 B: you know and i don't know 

263.98 272.85 A: that that is very very common i i come from a school where um sports is really really dominant and the football team [mn] that's exactly the way it was 

263.98 264.81 B: i 

273.11 279.62 A: um like drug abuse and alcohol violations and stuff like that in addition to schoolwork were overlooked 

279.76 280.76 B: mhm 

279.88 281.63 A: for for players 

281.46 282.91 B: oh yeah

305.26 306.26 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

308.37 317.40 B: talented kids but they don't realize once they get senior year in high school there's talented kids in thousands of schools cross the country 

316.98 319.86 A: right and such a small percentage actually make it 

319.88 322.06 B: [lipsmack] right exactly 

320.31 325.00 A: to to making any kind of life sustaining around money [laughter] 

325.20 331.09 B: and i just think it should've just stayed the clean old sport the way it used to be you know

337.66 339.87 B: mhm right i 

338.67 342.03 A: instead of it costing five hundred dollars for an afternoon at the ball park 

341.93 343.71 B: right exactly
