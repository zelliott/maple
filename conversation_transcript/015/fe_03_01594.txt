73.68 84.61 A: went through the check out and all of a sudden the beeper went off and they took me over to the side because they had thought they had seen something in the plastic bag that i'd been carrying and was 

85.04 87.68 A: they they're you know the guy was sitting there with the 

87.92 92.42 A: like a computer station where they could see everything that was in your bag as such 

91.44 92.38 B: uh-huh 

92.87 97.46 A: and ah i had gotten a little i don't know whether you're familiar with the ty

107.60 111.79 A: and ah i had them you know stuck down in the bottom of my bag 

112.04 120.69 A: and i didn't think anything about it well they went through the bag they took everything out of the bag didn't find anything they put it back in the bag and it went off again 

121.39 131.05 A: and the guy on the computer was looking at it and it the way that the wire you know that went through the body of the little doll and down through the legs and such so that they bent 

131.32 139.17 A: the way that it showed up on the computer it looked like a razor blade or some sort of a little scalpel like thing that was what they were looking for 

139.00 140.73 B: (( hmm oh )) 

140.10 145.54 A: but they did they pulled me over and they searched all through that bag took everything apart 

145.49 146.99 B: wow 

146.90 150.75 A: yeah it was i mean it was kind of scary really because you didn't know what 

150.66 151.75 B: [laughter] 

150.84 154.31 A: if somebody had actually dropped something in your bag as such but i 

154.58 156.58 A: i think i feel a little bit safer 

156.69 159.11 A: and i'm i'm hoping for sure that it 

159.28 160.25 A: deters 

160.31 160.89 A: (( 'em )) 

160.76 164.27 B: yeah so is actually the wire in the beanie baby 

163.56 169.34 A: yeah it was actually the little wiring you know they had a little wire down through the body of it and into the legs 

169.32 170.66 B: oh wow 

169.45 175.44 A: and into the arms and that was what they were looking at on the screen it showed up any type of metal or any 

175.60 178.53 A: i don't know what you know what all that goes through but it 

178.63 180.64 A: it shows up any type of metal 

180.71 182.36 A: and i guess some other 

182.74 188.90 A: stuff too because i know that there were there were some other things that they were looking at besides the doll i don't 

188.22 189.63 B: mhm 

189.01 192.19 A: i didn't know exactly why but he showed me the 

192.24 195.17 A: you know the screen on the doll and showed me what it looked like 

195.86 196.95 B: (( oh wow )) 

196.14 199.25 A: it was it was kind of weird [laughter] 

198.42 200.21 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

200.41 207.01 A: and i know when we came back ah we got off at that stop and had to lay over at another city and came back through 

207.04 208.13 A: and ah 

208.47 209.86 A: my grandson 

210.00 218.34 A: he was seventeen he was with me and it i guess they just pick a random number of people and they pull you out of the line to be searched 

217.92 219.09 B: mhm 

218.75 221.76 A: and that was what they did with him it scared him to death 

221.53 222.63 B: (( oh )) 

222.25 230.36 A: but yeah he had to take everything out of his pockets he had to take off his belt and he had to take off his shoes so they searched through his shoes and everything 

227.44 228.54 B: right 

229.93 231.16 B: mhm 

231.98 233.12 A: but i'm i'm 

233.34 237.20 A: i feel a little bit bitter about it i'm not too keen on flying anyway though really 

237.40 238.48 B: (( oh )) 

238.21 239.57 A: mhm 

240.02 241.18 A: and you 

240.16 240.79 B: (( i'm )) 

241.06 243.43 B: i'm not sure i mean 

244.02 253.15 B: i just think that unfortunately even with higher security measures i think the people who are trying to do harm are going to find a way 

247.91 248.95 A: yeah 

253.14 254.19 A: (( really mm )) 

253.86 267.43 B: yeah and with the news pretty much that they're going to find a way to get around it and and um you know it's sars that probably deters them a little bit more that makes them have to think a little more but 

266.79 267.56 A: yeah 

267.59 269.95 B: i think ultimately you know 

270.82 273.18 B: they're going to they're going to find a way 

273.01 273.84 A: (( right )) 

274.64 278.41 A: i hope not [laughter] i really do 

274.67 275.71 B: and 

275.73 279.08 B: i i know but [laughter] yeah yeah 

278.42 285.14 A: i hope they come up with something that's it's foolproof on any other but you know i don't know whether they ever will or not but 

285.98 287.98 A: i hope this helps anyway 

288.32 289.54 A: and it stops 

290.04 292.26 A: i imagine for a while it'll it'll 

292.60 294.81 A: stop almost any of 'em until they 

294.97 297.62 A: kind of feel secure in it again 

299.81 303.38 A: but i i just hope it they do something they come up with something 

304.12 306.14 A: they know before they had ah 

306.29 309.94 A: the way that they are taught they you know anybody could be 

310.31 312.13 A: one of the checkers there 

312.06 313.49 B: uh-huh right 

313.33 318.33 A: and now i think that that ah like federal and police are doing it so i feel better about that too 

318.32 324.28 B: well not only that but all those um reports on the shows that show how people can get to 

324.10 325.17 A: yeah 

324.44 327.65 B: you know get on the airplane without being detected you know 

328.27 332.14 B: with fake i._d.s and badges and you know 

329.96 334.36 A: (( ah yeah that shows that that can be done right there )) 

333.93 338.29 B: yeah so i think even more needs to be done and i don't know 

339.27 347.91 A: i think i feel more secure with the people like that that what what worries me more i think than someone getting through like that like the individual person is someone 

348.17 350.77 A: putting something in a bag and getting it through 

350.89 351.75 A: (( you know )) 

353.74 354.81 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

354.92 356.19 A: because 

356.38 361.51 A: you know who's to say that they could put something in there and somehow or other it didn't get scanned or do do 

361.65 363.03 A: do all 

363.28 366.92 A: pieces of luggage get scanned through or do they just do 

367.08 369.11 A: random checks on luggage too right 

369.87 372.80 B: i don't know but i remember when i was flying at 

372.86 381.44 B: um you know they had set up all these tables for pe- for them to go through everyone's luggage you know like ran- like random checks through luggage and everything 

378.61 379.60 A: right 

380.59 381.65 A: (( no i don't )) 

382.45 387.43 B: but i don't know like behind you know do they scan them 'em also i don't know 

386.51 387.39 A: (( know )) 

390.61 392.38 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

392.79 396.95 A: if we'll ever really feel as safe as we ever did i don't know whether we ever will 

397.33 398.23 A: (( you know )) 

399.26 401.52 A: (( it's like so many things can happen )) 

402.31 405.11 A: i really don't care to fly any more i don't believe 

404.95 406.25 B: [laughter] 

405.64 410.54 A: i did go there went to with with i travelled with my daughter but 

412.42 417.00 A: (( of course [mn] i guess if anything's going to happen it can happen on a plane or anywhere else either )) 

416.94 418.34 B: mhm 

418.65 421.65 B: yeah i think i've flown flew twice 

421.75 424.77 A: really since then or just 

422.29 423.59 B: yeah 

424.60 426.81 B: i actually flew in october 

426.66 428.77 A: (( oh did you really oh god )) 

427.27 429.31 B: yeah right afterwards 

430.34 431.95 A: that would have scared me 

432.80 443.00 A: that really would have scared me i know i think shortly after that happened i believe my daughter did fly somewhere and it it it seemed like that's all you're thinking about you know 

441.81 450.47 B: mhm i think what scared me more i don't mind all the additional searches and everything but what scared me was just seeing all the 

447.06 447.85 A: uh-huh 

451.39 453.01 B: (( um is that there ah g- )) 

453.54 457.99 B: the guards with their you know guns and everything walking around 

457.54 460.42 A: yeah that would be that would be scary 

459.96 461.94 B: that was what scared me 

464.14 466.84 B: i'm just not a big fan of guns so 

466.55 467.65 A: (( yeah no )) 

466.98 469.67 B: [laughter] being that close [laughter] 

468.33 470.21 A: i know it i know 

470.29 471.12 A: (( it i know )) 

471.75 475.66 A: i hope they i do hope they come up with something that's foolproof 

476.17 478.51 A: so that people will feel comfortable again 

478.22 479.36 B: mhm 

480.31 481.02 A: but 

481.69 487.16 A: until then i guess the majority of us will still be taking our chances every time we go up in the air 

487.87 495.41 A: but i think every time you go up in the air you're taking your chances anyway it's just like getting in a car though you're taking a chance when you go off in a car for that matter 

490.58 492.28 B: (( yeah [laughter] yeah )) 

495.37 500.38 B: yeah i mean it's more a likelihood right i think air travel's the safest 

497.78 498.95 A: mhm 

499.88 503.38 A: right that's what they say it's more safe than a car 

501.18 502.30 B: yeah 

502.93 503.89 B: (( [laughter] )) 

503.87 506.26 A: (( but if your )) 

506.98 516.05 A: i always said i wanted to be close to the ground [laughter] i don't have any chance of being flatter something else happens but oh i don't know 

509.19 510.69 B: [laughter] 

513.37 514.44 B: (( [laughter] )) 

515.92 521.00 B: i think it's just you feel like you have more control in a car than you do in the air 

519.37 524.67 A: yeah you get control of your own destiny not not someone else handling that's 

521.82 523.15 B: right 

524.72 525.84 B: right 

525.39 526.51 A: i don't know 

527.82 529.69 A: oh i don't know i don't know 

529.40 530.61 B: (( [laughter] hm yeah )) 

530.89 534.77 A: i'm i'm kinda glad i don't live in a large city 

536.40 539.26 A: where i don't have to do a lot of that kind of travelling 

542.59 546.90 A: but we have our everywhere i guess is the same though every place has their own 

547.49 548.67 A: problems 

548.43 549.64 B: mhm 

551.68 553.62 B: so have you done many of these talks 

553.72 555.83 A: (( i've only done i think well this is this )) 

556.11 558.06 A: is actually my third one 

557.68 559.01 B: oh it is your third 

558.37 561.58 A: (( yeah yeah this is my third one i believe )) 

561.72 568.56 A: it was surprising because the first time the day that i signed up for 'em i think i got two calls that same night 

568.47 569.39 B: (( okay oh )) 

569.73 574.38 A: (( so 'cause this must be my fourth 'cause i know i've had one before after that )) 

575.04 577.68 A: so it's really strange are you have you been doing it long 

577.67 579.55 B: well this is my second 

579.26 580.52 A: oh is it 

579.91 582.64 B: but i signed up a while ago 

582.38 583.24 A: uh-huh 

582.76 587.25 B: and right after i signed up i got my first call and then didn't get another call 

588.03 591.06 B: until maybe a couple of days ago 

590.91 592.00 A: yeah 

591.35 594.47 B: but for somebody i just it hung up on me 

594.72 595.98 A: oh really 

595.27 596.59 B: yeah 

596.49 597.81 A: (( oh goodness )) 

597.48 599.90 B: so i was kind of surprise
