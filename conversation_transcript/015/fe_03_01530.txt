12.94 14.03 A: [laughter] 

15.04 19.00 B: they said recently and i'm thinking well i don't know [laughter] 

20.87 22.31 B: you're not sure either 

22.90 36.93 A: i know that there's been pending strikes i don't know if they have actually gone on strike the last that i'm aware of is pending strikes that they're still in the talks um i'm kind of lost to the world right now in ah 

29.28 30.16 B: oh 

30.60 31.45 B: (( ahah )) 

37.11 43.06 A: t._v. is on limited and ah we try not to listen to the news for everything else that's going on right now 

42.89 44.17 B: oh okay okay 

43.62 46.02 A: so yeah exactly 

47.15 47.93 B: well 

48.27 50.16 B: do you think they are over paid 

51.44 56.48 A: no i think they should get about ten times the amount of money how's that for being facetious on a saturday [laughter] 

54.00 55.48 B: (( right [laughter] [laughter] )) 

57.04 60.31 A: yeah i mean they are definitely over paid there's no question about that 

59.86 60.80 B: right 

61.08 62.19 A: but 

62.78 63.85 A: for 

63.90 67.62 A: today's world it's what's expected um 

66.27 67.28 B: mhm 

68.34 78.94 A: the strike i can i i would not understand it if they were asking for more money and that's what the bottom line is to it if they have do with contract negotiations um 

79.45 90.21 A: about how long they are able to work when they are able to work what kind of benefits families is included things to that nature i can understand the strike [noise] in regards to any type of union job 

89.93 90.85 B: mhm 

90.43 93.99 A: (( but for wages i don't really think they have a right to )) 

93.84 95.32 B: yeah i agree 

96.12 98.04 B: and i think that um 

98.84 110.28 B: well i know as a fact baseball has suffered in the last five years um they haven't had the attendance and they haven't had the ratings on t._v. and that kind of stuff so um 

110.60 112.99 B: [mn] i think that ah 

113.84 118.55 B: they definitely need to just get a reality check [laughter] 

119.14 120.96 B: um i don't know 

120.15 122.69 A: [laughter] i like the way that you put that 

122.14 128.09 B: yeah [laughter] i was actually sleeping my husband just woke me up and gave me the phone [laughter] 

128.76 130.78 B: when i put my daughter down for a nap 

129.08 135.51 A: [laughter] you're you're about to about ready to say honey you are not gonna believe what i had a talk about 

134.93 139.76 B: oh it's no this one is easier than the last two i had so anyway 

138.93 144.58 A: but is is your husband more into sports that he'd be surprised by you just speaking on this topic 

144.07 149.37 B: um he's into football i don't think any of us are into baseball though 

149.11 154.73 A: you know the general topic that we are given is in regards to professional athletes 

154.14 155.11 B: mhm 

155.26 156.84 A: um striking 

156.94 160.85 A: and the first thing that comes to your mind and the first thing that comes to my mind is baseball 

157.45 158.26 B: okay 

160.45 161.35 B: right 

161.34 168.45 A: so i guess that's that is what what the news is in regards to baseball players and i read you know in history 

164.49 165.50 B: mhm 

168.82 176.75 A: that i am aware of i cannot recall anything um to my knowledge of hearing about any other players besides baseball players striking 

176.52 177.48 B: mhm 

176.95 184.36 A: and i don't know where that comes from any different in regards to basketball or football hockey or any of the other sports 

182.54 183.50 B: yeah 

184.17 189.67 B: yeah i don't i think you're right i mean i i certainly don't hear about professional ice skaters striking 

189.53 191.13 A: [laughter] 

189.91 192.57 B: (( [laughter] )) 

193.47 198.99 B: ah um i don't know i mean unless it's like an injury thing if they want to get paid out if 

199.00 202.09 B: you know they get injured while playing baseball but 

202.12 204.11 B: i don't know it doesn't seem like um 

205.49 212.33 B: that's as rough of a sport as some of the other ones you just mentioned especially hockey or football so [laughter] 

211.77 218.62 A: yet you would think in regards to ah people getting this type of pay and wanting to strike for it 

218.80 221.27 A: you would think something you know using ah 

222.05 224.80 A: [mn] an example of a of an ice skater you know 

223.92 224.77 B: mhm 

224.64 238.47 A: they would probably say the same thing you know why can't why are we not getting paid as much as somebody else is getting paid you know we're doing as much as what they are we are competing against other people we are on national television we bring you know audiences you know live to our events 

229.48 230.41 B: mhm 

238.14 238.90 B: right 

239.22 240.12 A: um 

240.26 251.40 B: and in terms of if you wanted to i mean i i follow ice skating quite extensively and i know that they are usually in the top three of viewership you know when they do have the televised t._v. events 

251.20 259.73 B: and ice skaters aren't getting near the money that some of these basket- or baseball players are getting you know and it's there is no union there is no 

259.88 264.02 B: um you know it's not a team per se it's all individual 

264.06 265.64 B: athletes but 

265.97 271.26 B: yeah if you want to talk about how much revenue they bring to the sponsors and things like that 

271.30 275.22 B: especially you know the ice skaters there's no comparison but 

275.39 282.51 B: i mean they are still paid well for what they do [laughter] i don't think any ice skaters are starving [laughter] but um 

282.68 284.35 A: some of them look like it though 

284.26 287.75 B: that's true [laughter] that's true 

289.07 293.32 B: but i [laughter] you know i'm big you know i 

293.76 295.84 B: i'm trying to think of the author but 

295.91 298.62 B: oh christine brennan writes ah books about 

298.98 307.27 B: you know how um viewership and um how left people are reading newspapers and she thinks that ah 

307.51 308.95 B: that um 

309.26 310.07 B: that 

310.40 312.62 B: newspapers should go after women 

312.59 327.16 B: and and report on women's sports and you know try to get that to increase newspaper readership and because that's one of the things that women typically like to watch [laughter] i don't know but you know at least in denver here 

327.20 331.99 B: ice skating is usually covered on page sixty eight you know [laughter] it's not a headliner 

332.27 334.12 B: so i don't know but 

334.99 338.12 B: yeah i haven't heard of any other strikes um 

338.71 344.98 B: i like watching baseball but i i guess i just tend to not think about how much money they are paid but 

345.08 348.62 B: i have two young children so we don't really get to the ball park 

348.78 350.53 B: too frequently [laughter] 

349.81 357.66 A: i don't i don't think for fans i don't think it's their main concern they are aware of it there's nothing they can change whether they want to or whether 

354.29 355.19 B: mhm 

355.22 356.44 B: right 

357.73 359.31 A: (( they can it's the same thing )) 

359.59 360.71 A: (( with um )) 

361.57 363.54 A: with professional um 

363.65 374.67 A: athletes of what they get paid compared to what people get paid in the entertainment industry and the bulk of it is is just unbelievable amounts of money in comparison to what they expect people to live in you know on a minimum wage 

365.41 366.46 B: (( right mhm )) 

367.64 368.55 B: mhm 

374.39 375.23 B: right 

374.81 382.72 A: you know which is you know not nearly possible on today's salaries that aren't minimum wage aren't any different to what think were ten fifteen years ago 

379.48 380.47 B: mhm 

382.78 389.30 A: and i think it's the same thing when somebody gets in front of a t._v. or ah goes to a movie theatre and sits there and they don't look at the 

389.60 393.79 A: [lipsmack] the movie of a television show and say hey look at that actor 

393.55 394.64 B: mhm 

393.85 401.38 A: you know they are getting paid x. amount of millions of dollars for doing this i don't even think the thought goes through their minds they're aware of it 

399.74 403.95 B: that's that's that's a valid point i never thought of it li- you know 

404.88 409.00 B: because you want to go see julia roberts maybe even though she is getting twenty million per movie 

409.03 415.49 B: [laughter] they are probably you know making more than than some of the athletes that is a good point 

415.38 416.24 A: but 

415.52 428.03 B: what what burdens me is when they build a new stadium and then they like in denver they built a new stadium and then they tax people i don't even live in the denver county and we have to pay taxes on the stupid new stadium 

427.90 437.67 B: that you know i'm from california i don't even care about these denver teams you know [laughter] so that's how that you know that kind of thing drives me crazy when you don't even think you'll 

438.11 440.61 B: you know be participating and 

440.64 451.39 B: what is going to go on in that stadium and you are getting taxed for it i don't agree with that because these are definitely private teams it's not a public olympic type thing or you know 

451.69 452.42 B: (( i don't )) 

452.61 454.53 A: and then whose name is on it 

454.89 455.74 B: know 

455.42 458.20 A: you know it's not you know it's not denver stadium 

456.03 457.13 B: right 

458.10 459.61 B: right exactly 

458.34 468.14 A: you know if it was you know city county some type of government you would you would think otherwise so you know who is paying for the stadium and the salaries they are getting paid to play in there 

461.55 462.64 B: mhm 

467.89 468.91 B: mhm 

468.23 475.98 A: and then they want the people to pay for where they are playing at inclusive with the salaries that they are receiving and the salary that you are receiving isn't even close to it 

472.87 473.77 B: yes 

475.62 481.24 B: and its poors field yes exactly [laughter] what area of the country are you in 

478.90 479.79 A: i think 

481.08 483.46 A: i am from where you were from [laughter] 

482.73 485.44 B: oh you are from california okay northern or southern 

483.65 484.99 A: yeah 

485.39 486.18 A: southern 

486.01 486.98 B: okay 

487.01 491.19 B: 'cause i know that packbell stadium in california 

491.41 493.60 B: i don't know if they were taxed for that but 

493.14 495.77 A: (( but is it still packbell because packbell is now sbc )) 

496.18 499.26 B: oh okay yeah i i know that's a 

496.89 498.19 A: [laughter] 

499.18 502.72 A: i just got my first phone bill with the new s._b._c. name on it 

502.33 503.65 B: s._b._c. 

503.19 504.55 A: s._b._c. yeah 

504.15 505.22 B: oh okay 

504.61 505.32 A: (( yeah )) 

505.37 506.45 A: yeah 

506.66 507.43 A: (( yeah )) 

506.67 508.49 B: (( are you near near santa barbara )) 

508.68 511.64 A: no no no no packbell officially changed their name 

511.44 513.72 B: oh i know but where in southern california are you 

513.14 514.19 A: oh l._a. 

513.97 515.24 B: (( oh l._a. okay i )) 

514.60 515.44 A: yeah 

515.55 517.25 B: (( went to college in santa barbara so [mn] )) 

518.06 519.52 A: but um 

518.74 520.82 B: well um 

520.31 529.00 A: i think back on the subject with the strikes in itself i think bottom line to it is what are they striking for then i think that's where 

526.22 527.30 B: mhm 

529.34 533.79 A: myself personally where my feelings come whether i agree with what they are doing or i don't 

533.22 536.13 B: yeah and the economy is so poor that 

536.09 548.63 B: i think that you just have to say [laughter] come on you know you should be very happy that you even have a job [laughter] you know all the engineers that are out of work and you know for certainly 

548.61 551.55 B: less money than these players i don't know 

553.17 554.37 B: it's terrible 

554.47 555.01 B: (( i )) 

555.15 562.42 A: but is the bottom line to the strike are they striking for money or are they striking for benefits i mean i don't even know if it's if it's union or not 

562.28 571.46 A: anybody who if it is union they held the right for their contract negotiations and if they don't agree it's part of being in a union no matter what type of profession to be able to strike 

570.57 571.98 B: (( don't know mhm )) 

571.53 576.19 A: but if the bottom line for professional athletes for a strike is more money 

575.90 576.84 B: mhm 

576.81 577.66 A: sorry 

578.78 580.64 A: you don't have me agree with them 

580.96 584.02 B: yeah no i agree my husband's in a union um 

584.68 590.08 B: but at the same time they get to vote and [laughter] they should be able to if it is you know 

590.27 597.14 B: if they are in a union and they can vote you know some of them can just sit there and try to convince the other people 

597.53 599.95 B: come on just vote you know to get the pla-
