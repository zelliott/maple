12.39 13.73 A: oh all right 

13.85 18.98 A: so uh what's your feeling on airport security i think i've already talked about this with someone before but [laughter] [mn] 

19.40 34.31 B: [laughter] uh well yes i do think that the um things they have in place now it's going to reduce the risk but i do believe that there's still the chance that things could happen that they don't foresee 

34.37 48.01 B: uh i know a couple of years ago my son took an airplane trip and i know airport security was very lax then i know we were in and out of the airport with no security hardly at all i mean they didn't even hardly check you 

45.76 47.08 A: (( mm )) 

47.89 50.12 B: and i know it's a lot different now 

50.62 54.41 A: [lipsmack] huh um hey where ya from sherry 

54.07 55.47 B: mississippi 

55.37 57.03 A: oh wow so how 

57.05 57.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

57.92 61.60 A: how do you know of like i mean are you do you live in philadelphia though or 

62.05 64.25 B: uh no i'm in mississippi still 

64.01 67.98 A: oh wow so how do you know about the study 'cause the study's out of philadelphia right 

67.43 70.31 B: [mn] uh [sigh] it was it was through the internet 

70.36 71.96 A: oh that's cool 

71.38 73.19 B: [laughter] 

72.14 73.88 A: (( oh okay um )) 

73.22 75.49 B: and so you live in pennsylvania then 

75.03 76.49 A: yeah yeah 

76.30 88.22 B: th- a matter of fact that's where my son took the trip to [laughter] it was um a little place near um [lipsmack] near harrisburg i think i can't remember the name of the town but uh he took a trip there 

81.30 82.31 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

84.27 85.19 A: okay 

88.55 90.37 B: do you fly much 

90.46 92.48 A: (( [mn] i uh do )) 

92.54 97.59 A: i fly i i mean yeah i guess i guess i do a a pretty good amount 

97.64 99.48 A: um but uh 

99.88 109.37 A: i don't know how do ya what's your i think the real issue is uh is is racial profiling and how do you feel about that considering that you know statistically 

106.96 108.25 B: [noise] 

109.39 113.20 A: uh so many of the terrorists are 

113.24 114.58 A: arabic 

114.70 116.78 A: you know how do you how do you feel about 

116.67 124.78 B: [noise] um i i believe that it should be racially profiled because um most of the terrorist attacks are 

116.80 117.75 A: you know 

124.66 132.16 B: uh perpetrated by middle easterners so i think you do have to concentrate on them uh even though i realize someone else could do it 

131.99 140.49 B: they seem to be the ones that are targeting us and so i feel like it's okay to do that and i think they should if they have nothing to hide they should understand [noise] [noise] [sigh] 

140.30 145.07 A: right i actually agree with you on that one [lipsmack] i do uh 

145.90 148.23 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

148.34 149.93 A: you ever watch um 

150.14 158.16 A: there's a show hard ball with chris matthews on m._s._n._b._c. and uh one of one of my favorite quotes from that show is he says uh 

158.20 164.47 A: he said i'm not saying that all terror- uh all arabs are terrorists but i am saying that all terrorists are 

164.19 167.32 B: (( [laughter] they guess )) 

165.58 167.20 A: (( arab you know what i'm saying )) 

167.22 168.44 B: (( that's true )) 

167.25 168.19 A: [laughter] 

168.33 169.62 A: (( yeah exact- )) 

168.34 183.26 B: uh i mean you know you look at the world trade center and and using the airplanes in the way that they did uh you've you've got to turn around and you've gotta look at that and and see what's been h- what's happened in the past and you know you've got to go from there 

174.74 175.50 A: (( right )) 

183.33 184.96 B: and um [sigh] 

183.55 184.33 A: yeah 

184.78 186.57 A: yeah and uh i totally 

185.11 187.59 B: and check them a little more securely 

187.17 192.80 A: there's this crazy fact that something like uh something like ninety percent of all terrorists 

193.05 199.11 A: are named mohammed or of all perpetrators of terrorism have mohammed somewhere in their names that's pretty weird huh 

198.14 199.37 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

199.16 200.13 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

199.38 201.05 B: [lipsmack] that's true 

201.07 203.69 A: (( yeah um [lipsmack] )) 

204.62 207.77 A: but anyway so what else [mn] oh 

207.48 219.03 B: [laughter] well tell me now like what kind of things are in place like since you travel a lot we we don't travel by plane uh the only experience i have is with my son you know traveling 

218.94 226.75 B: and i don't even travel on an airplane myself but uh what kind of security is in place for like when you go to the airport 

222.32 223.20 A: okay 

226.43 228.49 A: well i mean 

229.20 235.14 A: nowadays it's like uh you know i j- i just flew a few weeks ago and it's more [mn] you know 

235.25 245.27 A: uh it's it's stuff that you don't see really like appar- supposedly they they s- do search more people although i haven't been searched i've flown you know maybe four or five times since september eleventh 

245.06 246.55 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

245.47 247.06 A: and uh 

247.54 253.78 A: you s- there's more of a presence like you you do see more security but th- most of the time they're standing around kind of [sigh] 

253.40 257.99 B: oh so really this might not be working [laughter] do you think 

254.43 255.52 A: and 

256.88 258.87 A: i don't know it's it's 

258.92 261.63 A: s- s- i don't know it's it's hard to say like 

261.41 275.01 A: some people [mn] i mean th- they say that a lotta a lot of the new increased security is is stuff that you won't notice anyway like stuff that goes on behin- behind the scenes like you know plainclothes people stuff like stuff like that but 

272.07 273.55 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

275.11 279.11 A: um i don't know it's just really hard to say i'm not like 

278.26 286.54 B: [noise] so they're not like individual individually like um checking your suitcase like opening it and that type thing 

286.36 289.88 A: i mean s- i- it depends like some airlines like uh 

287.30 287.90 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

290.27 298.41 A: you know i know like el al which is israel's um airline which i've flown on a couple of times uh is very they i mean they almost check every bag 

298.61 310.01 A: almost every bag but then i mean i've never had my bags searched although i've seen people have their bags searched like i- it's pretty much i think they just do it on like a you know every tenth person they'll check or something like that 

309.17 314.69 B: oh okay and anyway you probably don't fit the profile right of what they're looking for 

312.67 314.43 A: (( right you got that you got it )) 

314.53 317.69 A: exactly i'm not i'm not a very suspicious looking person but 

316.87 320.60 B: [laughter] 

317.81 318.59 A: i 

318.72 323.58 A: i suppo- but i mean then again who knows 'cause theoretically they're not profiling anyone right so 

323.10 324.68 B: yeah [laughter] [noise] 

323.98 331.43 A: but i mean i'm i'm sure that that does it's it's a things whether people admit it or not but [sigh] um 

327.06 328.14 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

332.19 333.08 A: (( i don't know )) 

332.27 341.54 B: i'm sure that uh israel has a lot um more precautions in place anyway because of all the terrorist attacks they have anyway 

339.20 340.28 A: right 

340.81 342.40 A: yeah exactly [mn] 

342.51 343.61 B: uh 

342.53 343.29 A: (( i )) 

343.69 347.13 B: they've probably got a better system than we do [laughter] 

345.34 348.13 A: mean they've they've always they've always had uh 

348.15 362.05 A: v- v- very tight security i mean i have flown i've flown to israel um before september eleventh and i i got checked but they checked everyone you know they're they're not going to take any they don't take any chances with that type of thing 

350.59 351.98 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

358.21 359.76 B: yeah 

362.01 363.69 A: and that's really i mean 

363.77 372.26 A: the reason not to sound like an advertisement for el al but they [noise] they are by far have the best security record of any airline around so i 

371.68 373.59 B: yeah 

372.44 385.30 A: mean just because they they have to take that precaution so they do and it's pretty it's pretty impressive and they have armed marshals on every flight it's pretty [sigh] i mean once you get on that flight the you have to feel pretty secure 'cause 

385.66 387.50 A: they are intense 

387.19 391.78 B: [noise] [laughter] so they don't trust anybody everybody's a suspect 

387.90 389.17 A: (( about safety on )) 

389.85 390.76 A: no 

391.41 395.41 A: exactly but you know what maybe it's uh maybe that's the way it has to be you know 

394.77 399.70 B: yeah that might be better here if that's the way it was we might be m- safer 

397.39 398.28 A: right 

399.12 402.73 A: yeah i mean y- yeah it's tough to say like it's still 

402.83 414.81 A: i still don't get all that concerned about airport security i mean it sounds just like a stupid thing to say but but like when you when you look at it from a broader scope it's uh it's still the safest m- you know mode of travel 

414.55 415.77 B: yeah 

414.64 421.22 A: the truth is that you have much more of a chance of dying just by getting in your car if you get into an accident than you do by getting on a plane 

421.21 422.58 B: that's true [noise] 

421.50 426.71 A: you know statistically like you know so i i just feel like if you if you worry about 

426.72 432.61 A: you know these these isolated incidents that really aren't significant statistically then like 

433.13 439.95 A: you know you might as well just not drive anywhere it's i don't know you can't really worry about everything that's the way i feel at least 

435.75 436.40 B: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

438.41 439.68 B: yeah 

440.42 447.26 B: that's probably true it's just that i've never really but any time we go anywhere it's within driving distance so 

446.45 447.15 A: uh-huh 

447.32 451.36 B: i guess it's just easier for us to drive uh well i 

449.56 453.68 A: right no i'm not i'm not saying you shouldn't drive anywhere but you know what i'm saying 

452.87 455.38 B: yeah oh yeah i i realize that 

454.15 461.12 A: yeah right i mean you know i've gotten i've gotten into an accident driving and that was 

461.13 464.00 A: by far one of the scariest things in my life so 

463.58 465.89 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

464.03 467.37 A: who knows you know can't can't avoid every mode of transportations 

466.65 476.43 B: [laughter] but you know i guess it's the way people think about it if you're up in the air in an airplane and something goes wrong your chances are probably very slim [mn] 

473.01 474.96 A: exactly exactly it's just 

475.03 476.02 A: or just 

476.20 481.01 A: it's just so much more publicized when like 'cause you know when people do die it's by the hundreds as 

481.00 482.33 B: that's right [lipsmack] 

481.30 488.33 A: opposed to like as opposed to a hundred different crashes involving one person so it's just you know it's just like the 

485.94 487.89 B: (( yeah )) 

488.23 488.82 B: (( [cough] )) 

488.51 492.69 A: you're bound to hear you know you're bound to just be more concerned with it 

492.81 494.98 A: which seemed to be like the case 

492.84 494.60 B: (( yeah )) 

496.63 497.75 A: so 

498.68 502.57 B: [noise] so you say you had already talked about airplane security before 

498.91 499.93 A: (( but i don't know )) 

501.94 506.51 A: yeah i feel i could give you the tape i've only done one one of these before have i yeah 

502.83 503.69 B: [laughter] 

505.99 511.81 B: [sigh] i have done one and it was on time travel [laughter] uh-huh [mn] 

509.61 511.06 A: time travel 

511.21 515.04 A: (( wow how the hell do you talk about trime ta- time travel for ten minutes )) 

513.32 521.65 B: [laughter] it was uh theoretical you know what would you do if you could go back in time what kinda things would you change 

521.34 522.28 A: huh 

522.87 524.54 A: that's uh 

524.74 533.37 A: wow that's somewhat of an interesting one i don't know i have to say i'm s- i'm still skeptical about this i haven't been paid for my first call which was like two months ago 

525.51 527.16 B: [laughter] 

531.47 543.13 B: but uh [lipsmack] [sigh] [mn] well now [mn] my husband he did one [noise] uh on health care and he just got paid uh like like in the last few days yeah 

534.09 535.21 A: (( we'll see )) 

536.17 536.79 A: (( mhm )) 

538.89 541.11 A: oh well oh so they are paying 

542.23 543.82 A: that's good that they're at least 

543.14 543.90 B: (( [cough] )) 

544.04 550.40 A: making an effort to us i'm pretty skeptical about this but you know you figure whatever it's ten minutes of your life 

544.69 545.32 B: (( [mn] )) 

549.75 553.64 B: yeah that's right and then an extra ten bucks for something eh 

553.60 555.02 A: yeah exactly 

555.30 556.94 A: no harm in that 

556.37 571.21 B: [laughter] well like i said i haven't gotten paid for mine but he got paid for his i got an email a couple of days ago saying we were getting paid uh it was supposed to be by the end of this past week wasn't it but i haven't seen my check either so [laughter] [noise] 

561.78 564.49 A: yeah i know right i got that email too 

564.89 565.85 A: right 

570.96 576.23 A: yeah right all right let's hope this works out eh 

574.59 583.61 B: yeah i'd like to have me a bunch of calls make uh ten dollars every day and maybe a couple of times a day [laughter] 

577.32 577.89 A: (( [cough] )) 

581.40 590.81 A: exactly exactly i mean if you think about it like there's so much potential in this and but i don't feel like uh let's see i got some mail i hope one of these is a check yeah 

590.86 593.27 A: (( [laughter] i know )) 

591.62 594.47 B: [laughter] [noise] [laughter] 

593.50 595.87 A: nope no check damn oh 

595.00 599.95 B: i just wonder of what they're doing with the information exactly what are they uh 

598.72 599.89 A: (( well well ))
