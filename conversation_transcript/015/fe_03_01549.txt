0.63 2.70 A: hi i'm michelle 

3.26 11.61 B: hi i'm alta and i could not understand what she's saying about the subject was is it something to do with athletes 

11.04 17.68 A: yeah she wants to know if you think that they deserve the high paying um salaries that they receive 

18.24 19.85 B: oh i see 

19.54 22.46 A: [noise] i don't i i think that uh 

20.05 20.84 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

22.48 29.38 A: firemen and policemen and um teachers should get paid big money i don't think athletes should 

29.99 37.97 A: personally they put their life on the line everyday for people and um athletes they don't do anything but entertain 

38.03 40.52 A: and i think they're overly paid 

41.02 44.08 B: well you have a lot uh 

44.90 48.17 B: make a lot of common sense as far as i'm concerned 

50.43 56.39 B: i don't whether you could come with a valid argument for making 

56.59 57.69 B: um 

59.40 64.02 B: teachers and policemen and firemen which fully deserve 

63.86 64.82 A: yeah 

64.19 66.07 B: much more than they get 

66.09 68.54 B: (( uh equivalent )) 

69.41 70.68 B: (( um )) 

71.15 77.42 B: what athletes get or what someone else gets mainly because 

78.25 80.79 B: athletes train 

81.78 82.45 B: (( uh )) 

82.52 90.74 B: i'm just i'm trying to figure out there's just no way it it could come out that way even though maybe we think they deserve 

91.16 92.18 A: yeah 

91.56 95.09 B: you know what i'm saying i'm trying to say i guess 

92.78 93.70 A: yeah 

94.68 95.96 A: right 

95.37 96.45 B: (( um )) 

96.59 100.36 B: no i don't think they deserve as much as they get 

100.81 105.75 B: um any more than i believe uh c._e._o.s of 

105.38 107.21 A: corporations get it 

106.19 108.73 B: corporations deserve what they get 

108.43 116.28 A: i agree too i think that it should be evenly i don't know just when i hear that they make billions of dollars for hitting a ball 

114.68 115.77 B: mhm 

116.08 117.05 B: yeah 

116.43 128.20 A: that to me it it it's so ridiculous that i can't even believe that it's actually it's it's you know that it's really reality and yet i i think that there's so many other deserving 

127.97 129.25 B: oh right 

128.40 142.98 A: you know of that that i just i don't know to me it it's ridiculous i don't even like baseball or football or any those type of sports so i don't entertain myself in 'em and so i don't think the cost of what they make is 

138.37 140.02 B: mhm 

143.09 150.72 A: uh it's just bizarre i mean come on get real i mean all it is is entertainment and they get paid for much for entertaining you know 

149.86 152.72 B: well so do entertainers that's another thing 

152.17 155.44 A: yeah [laughter] yeah and i like i said 

153.05 156.97 B: you know it really is kind of unfair 

157.02 158.12 B: um 

158.71 172.94 B: and yet of course there are people who will argue that uh the more education you have the more training the more rigorous training you have um and that sort of thing the more you're in the public's eye you deserve more 

172.80 174.78 A: yeah but what kind of training 

173.36 176.71 B: we don't really agree with that 

175.96 181.44 A: no i i would agree if i would say that an actress or an actor goes through 

181.23 182.19 A: uh 

181.96 184.37 A: many years of college like a doctor 

184.17 198.36 A: i think a doctor is well paid i think they should be they go through eight years of college i mean it's not like they sit back and say hey you owe me you know what i mean i mean they really do they go through a lot of training and uh athletes i'm sorry they don't 

188.34 189.49 B: mhm 

192.52 193.53 B: right 

195.24 196.53 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

198.26 207.68 A: they're not as committed they're they're not long term they seasonal so they're not even doing it year round wh- where you've got a doctor that does it twenty four seven you know what i mean 

206.97 208.08 B: mhm 

207.83 213.13 A: and and that's why i think it's unfair in that respect as well i don't think that 

212.64 215.88 B: well there's another aspect to their high salaries 

216.07 221.20 B: it makes the sports too expensive for the average person 

220.88 222.03 A: to even go 

221.72 230.00 B: to go to now i'm past the stage where i'm interested in going to sports per se but or maybe i never was 

228.13 229.05 A: (( [noise] )) 

229.71 230.59 A: uh-huh 

230.13 244.32 B: but a lot of families cannot afford to take their children to ball games a lot of middle class or lower class who would like to find that way to entertain themselves can't afford it 

235.22 236.16 A: right 

236.28 237.24 A: right 

242.39 243.47 A: right 

243.88 245.10 A: that's true 

244.47 251.56 B: they absolutely cannot afford it so in that respect they're very overpaid also because it costs 

246.30 247.84 A: because the tickets run 

250.12 250.93 A: yeah 

251.95 256.28 B: uh everybody too much to give them that kind of money 

255.86 269.36 A: not to mention the items when you there [noise] like a regular hot dog's gonna cost you five dollars you know what i mean i mean who could afford to eat there [laughter] and i think that's a bit too much if you ask me you know 

260.28 261.45 B: [laughter] 

262.03 265.45 B: yeah right right [laughter] 

267.25 269.43 B: oh yeah the whole thing 

269.71 277.61 B: the whole thing is much too much i agree in fact i think that was one of the reasons that a lot of people 

272.16 273.10 A: (( yeah )) 

277.74 281.76 B: said that the baseball teams would end 

282.05 286.28 B: alienating themselves so much when they went on strike 

286.01 287.27 A: yeah 

286.63 291.74 B: that in the end they would they would destroy themselves because 

292.14 298.31 B: they already were out pricing you know pricing themselves out of the market and then 

298.34 305.75 B: when they went on strike for more money or more ability to get more money uh 

303.15 305.20 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

305.87 307.92 B: then that only made it harder 

308.20 309.59 B: on the 

310.56 315.03 B: uh people who would who who really pay their salaries 

314.71 323.23 A: exactly that you're exactly right because that is we are the ones that pay their salaries if if we go um we're paying it in our ticket price 

318.99 320.11 B: that's right 

323.05 324.50 B: mhm 

323.84 334.31 A: and um again like i said i won't even unless the tickets are given i don't go we don't go we don't even like uh the atlanta braves here in georgia they're um 

328.14 328.90 B: uh-huh 

334.30 336.39 A: they're still highly paid 

336.12 337.02 B: mhm 

336.27 343.01 A: and i can remember when we first uh moved to georgia they did not the games were so cheap 

342.82 353.54 A: that people gave away the tickets they didn't even i mean atlanta brave weren't even a game that hardly the stadiums were even uh maybe four hundred people at the most it was it was a big joke 

351.42 352.39 B: mhm 

353.41 361.36 A: and now because they got famous you know uh baseball players in there now you can't even get a seat and nobody's gonna give you a ticket 

361.04 362.28 B: mhm 

361.67 364.28 A: you know what i mean and it's just how it turned 

364.25 374.93 A: so drastically and then these guys are making two point three million dollars a year [laughter] to hit a baseball i just uh i just think it's ridiculous i i think that the money should 

373.16 374.57 B: mhm 

374.76 379.99 A: it's in the wrong direction you know it's more to the wrong people you know as far as i'm concerned 

378.49 379.48 B: yeah 

380.03 383.84 B: it seems to be that in the case of a lot of different 

383.58 384.91 A: aspects 

384.91 391.05 B: yeah uh teachers are definitely underpaid nurses are not only underpaid but under appreciated 

390.44 392.21 A: yes absolutely 

391.17 394.05 B: uh firemen and policemen uh 

394.07 398.18 B: they're lives are on the line um or the military 

396.04 397.06 A: daily 

397.97 399.82 A: oh absolutely 

398.75 402.39 B: they're taking away everything from the military 

402.23 403.29 A: yeah 

402.68 406.72 B: over the years uh my husband's a retired military man 

406.75 411.91 B: okay they've taken away things they promised them years ago 

411.51 412.55 A: (( mhm mm )) 

411.96 415.99 B: and um and and the new guys coming in 

416.20 417.25 B: um 

417.29 426.85 B: they can't live the enlisted men can't live on the salaries a lot of them are on food stamps to boot because they move you around so much 

423.81 425.18 A: oh gee 

426.50 427.78 A: (( mhm )) 

427.97 431.41 B: so there's a lot of inequity 

431.19 432.15 A: yeah 

431.53 435.67 B: in the whole [laughter] in our whole system of course 

434.74 435.48 A: yeah 

435.85 443.48 B: when you stop to think about it it's that way all over the world there's no there's no place [laughter] that's equitable no matter where you go 

439.33 440.19 A: yeah 

442.98 445.11 A: that's true that is true 

444.69 448.20 B: and apparently we have it better than anybody else 

447.59 456.35 A: and that's true and no complaints as far as i'm concerned on that part i mean i enjoy my freedom and and i wouldn't i don't take that for granted but uh 

450.71 451.98 B: [laughter] 

455.30 456.53 B: no 

456.23 470.68 A: i do you know i do appreciate the military and i appreciate the men actually um me and my husband were talking the other day about i thought a military man was in the restaurant and i was going to get up and shake his hand 'cause to me you know a lot of people 

470.71 480.92 A: maybe they don't see that person but i don't have to have someone in my family to appreciate what they do because you know they're fighting for our rights and our freedom and other countries don't have it 

474.82 476.01 B: mhm 

479.18 483.17 B: i'm the same way with policemen and firemen and 

481.61 486.28 A: yeah yeah and all of them i mean when you think about it 

483.39 484.47 B: yeah 

485.21 492.39 B: well nurses and teachers look at what teachers put up with look what nurses put up with from the doctors themselves 

488.23 490.56 A: yeah and they they're with our children 

491.77 498.49 A: yeah and look at they put up with our children i mean they take our children and have you know our children for eight hours a day [laughter] you know 

495.22 496.15 B: yeah 

498.06 503.19 B: [laughter] yeah there doesn't seem to be any fair way 

498.52 499.49 A: so 

503.65 505.00 B: to 

505.50 506.52 B: uh 

506.13 508.99 A: well maybe if people stopped paying for the tickets 

506.57 511.41 B: pay the ones who really deserve it more than the others [laughter] 

510.68 518.75 A: well maybe if people would stop pay- paying for the tickets and saying you know what i think that's an outrageous amount and maybe if they just started saying you know 

518.67 527.71 A: we don't need to pay these people that we need you know ticket towards who really needs to pay you know be paid for that because we're really paying into it 

523.81 524.98 B: yeah 

524.99 529.14 B: you know and they won't do it they won't do it because 

529.29 532.20 B: we live in florida we're retired 

530.58 531.40 A: uh-huh 

531.80 532.62 A: uh-huh 

532.38 535.68 B: and uh the teams come down here

549.92 550.85 A: mhm 

551.82 553.68 B: when they're down here 

554.15 557.77 B: those seats are all completely filled 

557.33 559.41 A: can you believe that mm 

559.01 566.19 B: and and you know it is expensive and as you say you can't even afford well you know a drink 

562.01 563.02 A: mhm 

565.85 567.38 A: yeah [laughter] 

566.41 571.68 B: blazing hot and the drinks and the and and any food and that sort of thing 

572.59 577.73 B: and they they still come they still fill the seats so as long as they're gonna do it

589.67 590.92 B: (( about it )) 

592.73 599.89 B: yeah and that's exactly actually what they're doing is giving a subject matter uh from what i understand
