0.00 2.01 A: hi my name is julie 

2.10 4.28 B: hi julie my name's pam 

6.10 7.09 A: um 

7.16 13.22 A: no i really don't think that um airport security lessens the threat of terrorism 

13.75 14.71 A: do you 

15.53 21.60 B: um i think it lessens the chance that anybody's gonna get on with nail clippers but 

20.86 23.26 A: [laughter] 

22.20 24.22 B: i don't really think 

24.98 30.99 B: that it lessens the overall i mean uh the ones that did it the way they did it got lucky 

30.96 32.00 A: (( uh-huh )) 

32.32 33.82 B: i don't think 

33.96 36.53 B: anything like that would happen again 

36.33 39.62 A: right hold on just one second 

37.89 38.86 B: and i 

39.12 40.06 B: okay 

41.44 43.40 A: all right you were saying what 

43.26 50.21 B: um and i don't think they have to hit us that way again because we're too busy running around the airport you know 

50.40 51.97 A: (( right )) 

50.74 51.72 B: (( checking people )) 

52.08 55.73 B: you know they're gonna be going some other way [noise] the next time 

55.59 59.19 A: i know i know actually i was in the airport a few weeks ago 

59.15 74.13 A: and it was like it was the orlando airport and some there was like a security alert and the flights were backed up for hours it was apparently a kid's science project that had set off the whole security alert i just think that's ridiculous 

72.53 73.52 B: really 

74.21 78.48 A: yes i think things like that are just too much too much i mean 

78.51 85.35 A: i'm not quite sure if you can prevent somebody who's going to do something from doing anything at all you know what i'm saying 

83.94 84.98 B: right 

85.63 98.74 B: right well i know i haven't flown since but not because of it i just haven't had to have happened to have flown anywhere um but but my sister travels quite a lot and some of the things they've told me 

85.96 86.84 A: i just 

90.56 91.72 A: mhm 

92.99 94.00 A: right 

96.28 97.16 A: mhm 

98.98 100.93 B: that they've taken from her 

100.92 101.92 A: right 

101.63 109.32 B: are like so foolish you know i mean she's a fifty year old woman who doesn't look like she's about to be terrorizing anybody 

109.16 112.31 A: right [laughter] i mean that's ridiculous 

110.11 111.81 B: you know and they're taking 

112.29 117.99 B: right they're taking her nail clippers and tweezers and you know razor 

117.03 121.23 A: right things that just are not going to do anything to anyone 

118.25 119.09 B: you know 

121.18 122.15 B: right 

121.30 124.41 A: i mean i just i don't know how 

124.74 136.64 A: it just makes me think that i mean at least it makes me think that the whole sense of this heightened airport security is more or less to scare people who don't really need to be scared 

136.02 137.45 B: right 

136.79 141.86 A: i think it's really sad but i mean i guess it's working because well 

141.24 143.48 B: well they haven't done it again but 

143.01 153.16 A: right but i mean i guess that just means that people are waiting until until a few years from now when people are like oh it's okay now to bring [laughter] nail clippers and such 

152.93 160.37 B: right or that you know everybody's so busy watching the airports we'll go hit the water supply or you know 

154.00 154.94 A: mhm 

157.22 158.25 A: right 

159.38 162.41 A: something else right right 

160.70 164.41 B: something else because they all think we're headed over there now 

164.25 171.19 A: mhm mhm like it just doesn't make sense it doesn't make any sense at all it's sort of upsetting 

169.50 170.53 B: right 

171.50 172.82 A: (( [lipsmack] but um )) 

171.83 176.59 B: well i know i live in um metropolitan chicago and at least 

175.58 176.80 A: oh okay 

176.65 190.81 B: and at least once a week we have something on the news about something at o'hare you know and it's usually you know somebody tried to get you know back through security or something 'cause they forgot something in the car or 

182.14 182.79 A: (( [sigh] )) 

190.64 192.62 A: right right 

191.48 193.60 B: you know foolish things 

193.62 199.08 A: see like i live in the d._c. area so i live around b._w._i. the national airport 

196.14 196.99 B: uh-huh 

198.95 199.81 B: uh-huh 

199.10 206.61 A: and so you know it's really crazy around here and not only with just airport security but with all sorts of security you know 

204.95 205.82 B: right 

206.23 207.26 B: right 

206.60 219.59 A: and it's a little excessive it makes you sort of like upset to go really anywhere well b._w._i. has improved i like i've flown quite a few times in between um september eleventh 

212.28 213.46 B: mhm 

219.64 229.73 A: and then now but b._w._i. has improved greatly but still yeah like but for a long time i used to be scared to go there because they had 

223.67 224.59 B: really 

229.62 238.78 A: people who were armed like the military standing in the airport and i used to be like oh my goodness this is not quite what i expected you know what i'm saying 

238.45 239.52 B: right 

238.70 244.75 A: like i was like oh goodness what happens if they just accidentally do something i just thought it was a little too much 

244.48 254.47 B: right but they were still busy putting all their emphasis on the passengers because my my husband's a truck driver and at the time he drove airfreight 

244.87 245.94 A: too much 

249.30 250.42 A: (( mhm )) 

254.35 255.40 A: okay 

255.39 266.72 B: so you know he'd pull up in his semi you know to united or or lufthansa whoever and just because he was driving a truck their security didn't change at all 

259.80 260.98 A: (( mhm )) 

266.76 270.35 A: yep and that's what you i mean seriously i guess like 

270.32 283.75 A: you have to think or i would hope that the government or whoever would think about that like the people who did the ok- oklahoma city thing were in a truck you know like that has nothing to do with a plane i mean i 

280.09 281.10 B: right 

282.60 283.62 B: right 

284.04 285.90 A: i just happen to think that 

284.42 290.69 B: you know here he is backing up you know a fifty three foot trailer with god knows what in it and 

289.68 291.48 A: right right 

290.64 301.79 B: you know and they're accepting his freight and they don't know what it is and so he scribbles something on a piece of paper that they assume is his name but they don't always ask for an i._d. 

301.65 303.67 A: mhm mhm 

302.56 310.93 B: or even if they say you know they tell him all the time write your driver's license number on there well he doesn't give out that kind of personal information so he makes up a number 

309.64 310.62 A: right 

310.92 312.01 A: (( uh-huh )) 

312.00 312.95 B: you know 

312.23 315.06 A: has your sister had to take off her shoes yet 

315.09 316.62 B: [lipsmack] my niece has 

315.43 329.86 A: has she told you about yes oh my goodness [laughter] oh i was so upset about that the first time it happened to me i was like oh my goodness do i even have on decent socks i just thought that was so crazy i was beyond upset 

317.03 317.76 B: yes 

321.31 322.24 B: right 

327.73 331.55 B: right like are my toes gonna be sticking out now or you know 

330.81 337.45 A: right you know and they tell you that all the time if you have on anything other than tennis shoes take your shoes off 

337.38 338.49 B: right 

337.57 338.87 A: what 

339.12 342.42 A: i mean i just think that is so crazy that is just 

341.74 342.68 B: right 

342.78 352.14 A: ridiculous i don't understand these people i really don't like it makes me want to write to law makers and just ask you know do you have anything else to be concerned about 

350.03 352.20 B: what were you people thinking 

352.38 358.45 A: yes i know just [mn] is there something else for you to be concerned about rather than 

357.51 358.51 B: right 

358.61 369.33 B: right it makes me wonder are you really doing because you're so stupid or is there something i'm missing why you're doing this that i just don't understand these absurd things you're looking for 

358.64 360.30 A: [laughter] 

369.40 379.13 A: right right like what is this that you know maybe with the whole little color coding thing had more to do with it hold on a sec you've got to wait a second hello 

378.89 379.84 B: uh-huh 

379.18 386.06 A: okay [laughter] maybe the whole color coding thing has more to do with airport security that we don't know about or something 

385.86 386.82 B: right 

386.11 387.64 A: i don't know 

387.84 400.02 A: i'm just like oh my gosh i think and like i i'm a teacher and a lot of my kids don't wanna fly like i teach se- like seniors in high school it's nearly about the time for them to be thinking about their 

389.89 391.11 B: mhm 

397.10 398.04 B: uh-huh 

399.89 410.56 A: their school their senior class trip and they normally go to the bahamas or something nice like that and now they have to go to new york for an afternoon of shopping 

402.51 403.49 B: right 

410.43 420.27 A: which i think is really s- yes i think that's so sad because they lived all 'cause it's three four hours from new york but to new york but 

410.60 411.76 B: really 

419.24 420.38 B: right 

421.10 430.13 A: right they go to new york all the time they go for shopping and they can't go to the bahamas because it'd be too much hassle for them to get through the airport 

430.23 434.14 A: like i just think that's crazy that is so crazy 

430.75 431.53 B: right 

432.57 433.94 B: mhm 

434.47 435.93 A: [lipsmack] i think that like 

435.95 441.40 A: i think a lot of the times well and especially for my children they seem to understand 

441.40 453.81 A: that like they're gr- well not they're they're almost grown but they seem to think that you know the united states is becoming some place where they can't move as freely as they once thought they could 

445.23 446.55 B: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

453.60 455.56 B: right well they can't 

453.88 455.01 A: you know 

455.77 460.58 B: w- when they when they're not just in their own vehicles 

456.54 457.53 A: right 

460.50 462.56 A: yeah yeah [noise] 

461.66 463.42 B: you know and it's 

463.53 467.82 B: part of its you know that we have been too 

468.23 471.25 B: i don't know innocent or whatever that all that oh that could n [noise] 

472.23 473.16 A: hello 

474.15 475.03 A: hello 

475.43 481.85 B: don't worry about it because we're not like israel or anything that would never happen over here 

478.63 479.65 A: (( uh-huh )) 

481.71 482.69 A: right 

482.85 486.76 A: mhm i mean and it just makes you think i think that 

487.24 488.85 A: like in a way 

489.09 496.95 A: i don't know i think that that's part of i think the whole idea that we are somewhat free to do whatever we want is like part of like 

497.16 508.26 A: the whole point of the country or like what the country is based on you know and now that that's not necessarily true it's a little scary for everybody 

501.84 502.76 B: right 

508.12 509.41 B: right 

508.82 514.17 A: you know except for law makers i guess because they get to capitalize on people's fears but 

513.64 514.70 B: right 

515.03 516.88 A: i just don't know like [mn] 

517.07 523.20 A: li- things like that i don't know the what the do they make a big deal out of the color coding where you are 

523.35 525.19 B: no not at all 

524.47 525.14 A: oh
