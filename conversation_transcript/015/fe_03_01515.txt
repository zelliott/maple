400.15 403.55 B: but that that is it's a scary thing it's a scary thought 

403.36 408.81 A: and the government certainly doesn't do things the way you know we would like for them to do 

409.69 412.18 B: of course i'm sure we don't know the whole story either

459.50 460.67 A: mhm 

460.50 462.23 B: and i just think that's amazing 

462.68 469.63 B: that they could i mean if he was such a big threat why don't they send a sniper in there and just kill him and then deny it 

471.24 473.44 B: i just i just think we don't have the whole story 

474.36 475.99 B: he can't be that good 

477.49 478.52 B: nobody can 

478.22 479.02 A: (( [mn] ))
