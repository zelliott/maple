151.44 160.78 B: certainly uh you know y- y- there were i mean you just as soon as as soon as you saw that you just you know you started fearing for the lives of all the other people that you knew were in the building 

155.11 155.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

158.96 160.33 A: exactly 

161.01 167.93 A: exactly i all i did was cry i think i just cried that whole day for all these people and just for [mn] 

161.61 162.36 B: (( yeah )) 

168.44 171.90 A: seeing it seeing the plane go 

172.18 174.64 A: and hit those buildings it was just 

175.37 176.49 B: mhm 

175.87 179.32 A: (( i don't think i ever i i i will never forget that as )) 

178.72 186.96 B: oh yeah definitely i mean i have yeah i i well i remember seeing the uh second plane you know because that happened live while they were covering it when the second plane 

179.35 180.66 A: long as i live 

186.02 187.63 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

187.06 193.23 B: and i you know i was watching when that happened and that was that just added to the whole uh ho- horror of the whole thing 

192.63 194.45 A: mhm 

194.13 195.38 B: (( and um )) 

195.84 202.85 B: but yeah i have i i collect i kept newspapers from that day and everything and i still have those stored away here somewhere but uh 

202.70 206.02 A: yeah i did the same thing i bought like um 

206.25 210.24 A: three days the day it happened and you know the two days following 

210.04 211.13 B: mhm 

210.51 215.58 A: i bought those and then i bought some other kind of special issue book 

215.30 216.74 B: mhm 

216.15 218.71 A: and you know 'cause my son he 

219.01 225.37 A: he's eleven but you know still to try and explain to a child you know why 

222.82 226.37 B: right mhm it can be tough yeah 

225.79 230.83 A: so i figured you know i'd just hang on to all of that when he's older he can look through 'em 

230.50 231.66 B: right 

231.07 234.34 A: and and see it but he didn't need to see it now 

233.97 235.49 B: that's good 

234.95 237.38 A: just like the war m- you know [mn] 

236.65 237.90 B: mhm 

237.59 240.02 A: just he don't need to know none of that 

239.25 241.33 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

240.67 247.05 A: [mn] yeah it was just it was just a terrible thing i know it affected me in the simple fact i don't fly any more 

246.68 248.23 B: oh yeah 

247.65 250.28 A: yeah i i quit flying 

250.33 264.14 B: i i i would say i mean i've always had the i i as far as affecting my life changing it in any way i don't know if i could really say i mean i maybe it made me more a little more aware and and to be aware of what's going on out there in the world 

264.08 277.16 B: every day but um as far as flying um i mean i've always i don't really think that's changed my my outlook on flying as much i mean i always whenever i i've done a you know quite a bit of flying in my life i'd say 

277.08 285.52 B: and every time i would get on a plane i always had that fear that you know in the back of my mind that th- there's a slight chance that something could happen but you know 

285.66 294.15 B: i'm a a devoted christian and the way i look at it is if if god wants to take take my life then well i guess he you know he has a good reason for it and uh 

294.37 296.67 B: i don't argue with the good lord so 

296.62 297.93 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

296.83 299.23 B: that's his choice and 

298.63 302.62 A: yeah it just [sigh] i've always kind of been aware 

302.70 304.05 A: you know of 

304.55 308.04 A: you know the surroundings and what could happen 

308.10 309.17 A: you know 

308.64 310.38 B: mhm 

309.74 310.72 A: but 

311.23 318.63 A: it never really dawned on me about flying that things like that could happen 'cause it's like that's just t._v. [laughter] you know 

315.56 316.39 B: right 

318.31 330.19 B: yeah i would say it probably i mean i you know i don't think we ever saw anything that big obviously before as far as a you know a terrorist attack on a plane or what whatnot but uh so i'd say maybe it has me a little more 

318.74 319.80 A: (( and )) 

325.68 326.84 A: yeah 

330.14 333.67 B: w- uh slightly more worried about that but as you know as 

333.81 337.46 B: [mn] if i ever have to fly again i'll definitely do it um 

337.63 344.03 B: it really hasn't backed me off from you know from doing that to get to a- a- another location 

341.68 347.13 A: yeah well that's good that's good no me it just petrified [laughter] me 

346.71 348.00 B: oh yeah and that 

347.16 355.50 A: i won't i won't do it i you know i just can't do it uh i tried it and i i couldn't get on the plane 

355.34 356.45 B: oh wow 

356.20 365.72 A: i just could not do it and i think it just it hit me even harder that you know what planes do get hijacked and things do happen but 

358.26 359.05 B: wow 

363.57 364.54 B: mhm 

365.86 368.42 A: we had what three planes that day 

368.19 369.83 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

369.00 371.94 A: so you know it was just like [laughter] 

371.38 372.62 B: mhm 

371.95 374.54 A: it it just really got to me 

374.22 375.43 B: yeah and well 

374.80 376.79 A: actually there was four planes 

377.09 382.50 A: so you know i- it just got me yeah pentagon and then the one that went in the field 

378.13 380.39 B: yeah that's right there were four right mhm 

382.28 390.46 B: mhm yeah that that's actually the w- the one that went in the uh field out here in western p._a. that was i s- i actually saw probably 

383.26 384.51 A: and then the two 

390.63 404.77 B: fifty percent of the coverage i watched that day was actually on that because you know that was so close to where i am here at school here at school i mean all the local news stations here also cover that area so they were you know obviously they were doing a lotta broadcasting from there as well 

396.15 396.96 A: yeah 

404.72 406.00 A: yeah 

406.11 410.27 A: that was just it was just a horrifying scene and i i 

410.91 414.17 A: i'll never forget it but i never want to see it again 

413.39 415.84 B: oh yeah yeah i don't think any of us do 

415.71 423.48 A: i pray for the people that that lost their lives and that and the brave people that tried to save 

420.10 421.07 B: mhm 

424.35 426.29 B: yes same with me yeah 

424.37 426.46 A: you know that last plane 

427.04 428.34 A: and um 

428.74 433.34 A: that's about all all you can do is just pray for everybody who's lost some- 

433.16 434.17 B: mhm 

433.55 436.57 A: their loved ones in all that garbage 

436.01 438.12 B: (( yeah )) 

437.60 438.96 A: just terrible 

438.87 439.77 B: (( yes )) 

440.90 442.29 A: but i don't know 

442.48 443.70 A: [noise] but 

443.08 447.07 B: yeah i- i- it it what i what i'm really glad to see is how 

447.08 452.15 B: they've really i mean i i think overall they've done a good job as far as you know 

452.37 460.85 B: beefing up uh the security measures and whatnot in the airport i mean it it it you know obviously there's some of that stuff is still gonna you're gonna get people that'll come in with 

460.99 470.37 B: maybe knives or whatnot in their in their bags and so forth i mean there's i mean you can only do so much but i think overall they're they're cracking down on that stuff more 

466.43 467.60 A: oh yeah 

470.54 480.12 B: um and and in you know in all in the ultimate the long run obviously it's not getting onto the planes anymore which is you know that's that's the best thing 

480.06 481.14 A: yeah 

480.11 490.24 B: and uh i you know th- that makes me happy to see that and i i just for it like i said i'm i really don't have as much of a a fear as far as 

490.32 499.72 B: you know flying you know even after what happened but uh it it it makes me i mean it still makes me a little feel a little better when i go and g- we get on a plane or whatever 

499.49 500.86 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

499.90 503.28 B: i i've flown twice you know since that happened and uh 

503.48 512.49 B: it made me feel i mean i actually well the two flights that i did really it security measures weren't that big a deal because i was on a private private flight but 

511.89 512.88 A: uh-huh 

513.11 519.99 B: yeah i mean it i still i i thought about it and everything and that i i definitely felt a lot better with with security measures 

520.48 526.99 A: that's good i'm glad you know that you you didn't let it you know get you well like me [sigh] 

526.54 527.72 B: mhm

559.57 572.28 B: a group trip i always like to be the one to drive just because i i love the scenery and everything and and and and you know the changes in the the locations or whatnot the kinds of landmarks you have and so forth [noise]
