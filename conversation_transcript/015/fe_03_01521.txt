0.00 1.01 A: hello 

0.65 1.76 B: hello 

1.87 5.61 A: hi i'm michael rosenfeld i go to university of texas 

5.60 9.85 B: hi i'm uh this is aton hollywood i go to university of maryland actually 

9.70 12.04 A: neato so we're both sports fans 

11.95 14.85 B: yeah i guess so [laughter] 

13.97 16.62 A: so what's your opinion on sport strikes 

16.75 29.59 B: well i mean i yeah i'm a big sports fan and but i guess sometimes it's hard to sort of take the strikes seriously you know when they're complaining about you know they only get six million but they really need seven million 

29.57 36.72 B: i mean it's hard to feel sorry for them you know given that most people don't make anywhere near as much as they do 

36.65 51.06 B: um i think what they i generally think what they make is deserved just because of the the revenue they bring in you know if they didn't bring in so much in ticket sales and t._v. and all that then they probably wouldn't be getting paid what they do so what'd you think 

49.02 50.09 A: that's true 

51.39 65.00 A: honestly like for some sports i can see it but i'm very much against baseball for the amount of strikes they've had first in the last like ten years and they always complain and they don't really have such a hard [noise] they don't really exercise all that much 

59.63 61.47 B: yeah 

65.39 66.21 A: i don't 

65.59 67.70 B: base- baseball players you say 

66.97 80.18 A: baseball players as compared to like every other sport like for example hockey players they play more games they're actually act like they're physically active and are in danger of injury like a baseball player the worst thing that can happen to you is you get nailed by a ball 

80.13 82.06 B: mhm 

81.47 85.88 A: and like they sit around you know you hit a ball fine you run a base you run a base you've done for the day 

86.44 98.49 B: do you think that when they strike they they really care about the affect that it might have on like fans you know um not wanting to follow the sport anymore or they don't really take that [laughter] into consideration 

98.29 111.92 A: well considering how many times they've striked in the last ten years haven't you noticed that like it used america's like baseball used to be america's pastime now no one cares anymore that's what i've noticed seeing the number of times they've striked i think it's been four or is it five i've lost count 

107.62 109.34 B: yeah 

111.09 114.10 B: i don't know i mean they almost had one last year i know 

114.08 116.76 B: um i mean it seems like they're they're 

116.59 121.33 B: there is certain fans that if they strike you know they really upset and say you know 

121.25 131.39 B: well i'm never going to watch baseball again and then there are other fans that you know will watch baseball regardless if they go on a strike or not and i think the athletes know that that you know they're not going to be 

131.38 146.17 B: i mean if they strike they may lose some fans but there's still going to be fans that will come and they pay the tickets prices so i think that probably goes into it but they know they can strike and like not lose all their fan base even though they probably don't wanna do it as much 

146.09 149.39 B: as um as they might i don't know 

148.32 149.17 A: yeah 

149.42 157.02 A: oh no what what other sports have striked i haven't really kept track i thought that was only wh- there was a basketball strike that how many years like 

155.75 168.82 B: yeah it was the bask- the basketball like i think i think it was different because there was like a lock out like an owner's lockout um it wasn't like i don't think it was the players that were striking but the owners 

168.59 170.87 B: i forget i forget why they 

171.27 179.62 B: maybe maybe it was the players like i just i just know that yeah you're right baseball has h a lot has had a lot more strikes um 

180.07 184.28 B: but i know i know basketball has had something hockey might have 

184.40 188.06 B: um i'm not you know too sure about uh 

188.30 190.54 B: about all of it but 

191.32 192.47 B: (( i don't know )) 

192.30 193.23 A: and uh 

193.40 197.46 A: oh well i guess that pretty much kills the topic do you watch the final four 

196.41 200.26 B: did i watch the final four yeah i i did uh 

200.22 212.86 B: this was actually the first year that i uh i wasn't at the final four i went down the last two years because maryland was in it the last two years so i went to watch it it's pretty good uh had a good time 

211.41 212.15 A: i 

212.16 217.61 A: i was pretty embarrassed by um university of texas we we had a pretty bad game 

217.44 218.36 B: yeah 

217.79 221.60 A: if if you actually watched that game it was it was pretty bad we just got 

221.09 222.22 B: blown out 

221.83 227.25 A: blown out by a bunch of highlight reels it was basically 

224.37 232.10 B: yeah you you don't by any chance um you're not by any chance a journalism major are you 

232.21 241.43 A: uh no it's like i would have gone to the game but i didn't have any cash at the moment the tickets prices weren't actually that bad they were about a hundred thirty dollars 

232.98 233.83 B: (( oh )) 

240.65 250.86 B: yeah when when i went it wasn't bad and we had like the best seats because they have students like for last year when we won the national championship we were like behind the basket you know and uh 

248.91 250.31 A: that's pretty good [noise] 

251.16 262.01 B: but i ask 'cause i'm i'm working um i'm a journalism major but i'm working with a guy from the university of texas he's a journalism guy this summer so i wondered if you knew him but um 

261.76 265.51 A: no so you get uh perks i guess if your journalism get to be 

264.91 272.33 B: well i i actually went on my own with my own money but i ended up like writing an article um just like about the fans and stuff 

272.12 283.95 B: like we like we sent our sports writers like they get all expenses paid and press passes and everything but i just went on my own and like ended up just writing an article just about like the fans and stuff like that um 

284.20 287.72 B: but you know i don't know are your from texas originally or 

287.50 291.74 A: oh no but i just lived here a long time but it 

290.85 292.52 B: where you from originally 

292.14 294.33 A: (( where am i from originally california )) 

294.12 294.97 B: oh okay 

295.31 296.73 A: yeah so 

296.98 299.84 A: i don't know i was kinda upset with the play 

299.93 306.31 A: especially especially like with our women's team also is kind of funny if you watch the women's basketball which people rarely do 

300.21 301.04 B: well 

307.37 309.02 B: how far did they get this year 

308.72 315.82 A: they also go to the final four if anyone cares yeah i i was the game and i was laughing 'cause we were leading the whole game and then like the last 

310.15 311.20 B: oh really 

315.74 324.06 A: minute or so uh what happens was well like they give up first of all they give 'em three for no reason and then they let them convert four points off a free throw 

324.26 331.65 A: and then like they missed their own free throws so it was just like ridiculous they lost like ten points in two minutes off some stupid players 

332.70 333.73 B: [laughter] 

332.94 338.45 A: i was it was just like what the hell you don't let four points off a free throw and like twice 

338.96 342.52 A: you know on the second bask- three row basket they got 

340.83 345.60 B: but i guess are you more are you guys more of a football school generally or 

344.83 349.47 A: yeah we're a big football school football tickets cost a ridiculously large amount 

349.58 352.62 A: like you pay like forty or fifty dollars a football ticket 

351.93 358.50 B: well is there still like as much enthusiasm over basketball like with the final four even though you're generally like a football school 

358.34 368.79 A: well yeah for like since this is the first time we went to final four for like fifty something years everyone was really excited about it you know it kinda picked up at the beginning year no one really cared about basketball 

368.70 374.01 A: i didn't attend any of the games i was like oh who cares and then like we started winning and we got 

374.18 380.45 A: excited and in to it then there was a big fury over it after we lost our final four you know we were 

379.60 380.39 B: uh-huh 

380.63 382.33 A: we'll see what happens next year 

382.07 384.24 B: did you guys have any riots or no 

382.38 383.33 A: (( hangs around )) 

383.93 387.28 A: no we don't riot we're too lazy to riot prop- [laughter] 

386.34 388.37 B: we we did we riot like 

388.24 402.13 B: the first year we were in the final four we lost in the semi final and then we rioted and this and then last year we won the whole thing and like we rioted even worse than like when we had when we lost so our school's a little ridiculous like that [mn] 

402.31 409.09 A: yeah i think we're too drunk to riot by the time you're ready like done with the game you just don't wanna walk anywhere it's like no yeah 

408.22 410.87 B: yeah well i don't know but 

410.76 420.54 A: we're not a big riot school for foo- i don't know about football what would happen if we actually ever won anything 'cause we never win any big games even though like we were ranked number one or so number two 

420.48 430.15 A: in the country at one point and we won like all our home games but then when we were gonna go to the final i forget what the final game is called like which 

429.81 431.81 B: oh like the whatever bowl 

431.22 434.49 A: whatever bowl like we went to the con bowl this year 

434.73 438.15 A: yeah we go screwed by texas tech if you watch football 

437.99 441.67 B: yeah so your school is at austin is that where it is 

441.06 443.16 A: yeah i'm at the austin branch 

442.95 444.16 B: it's pretty big 

444.01 447.98 A: yeah it's we're the biggest university it's like fifty something thousand people 

447.38 448.33 B: really 

448.17 458.64 A: it's uh it's not that bad you like you'd think that's bad but most of the people don't actually live near the university so during the day you know it's crowded around five or six o'clock you know you don't hard- you hardly see anybody 

458.80 470.80 B: yeah i mean we're thirty thousand so it's pretty big not as big but we've a lot of commuters like people in state so it takes away some of it you know as far as like living on campus and that kind of thing 

470.57 475.21 A: so what are your on campus housing prices ridiculously expensive like ours 

474.93 483.95 B: yeah well i mean i guess you're at state university as well so we've had a lot of like budget cuts you know and like tuition increases and all that 

483.35 491.14 A: yeah we've had the tuition deregulation what about you guys so so they're starting to think about tuition deregulation plus they just jumped the prices on us 

490.81 493.70 B: (( what do you mean like by deregulation like )) 

493.09 497.16 A: like uh our our tuition is set by the government like tuit- 

496.40 498.95 B: by the by the state government right 

497.40 510.03 A: by the state government and now the thing about deregulating that like there's a bigger debate on that we're trying to prevent that because first of all like if they do that we don't know what the prices will be like it'll be like kinda like supply and demand type system 

509.39 512.16 B: will can they can they raise it whenever they want 

511.56 517.06 A: yeah they raised it but they can't like raise it th- the raises are mandated by like certain laws 

516.66 522.20 B: yeah see like that's like we had that and they just like i don't know if was law but they said you know 

522.00 532.85 B: we won't pass a tuition increase any higher than like whatever percent and then they were just like well you know the state budget is so bad that we have to they did more than we thought they were going to so 

532.73 538.05 B: so screw all you like there's really no protection like they say they don't want to but they do it anyway 

537.67 541.22 A: that's what's been happening to us and we're like oh bullshit 

540.92 553.82 B: like we actually had this year like they've in the past they've raised tuition from like year to year but this time they actually raised it like mid mid year like we for the spring semester like we paid our tuition 

553.72 556.76 B: and then we came back and they sent us a bill that was like well 

556.56 570.64 B: you actually owe us like another three hundred dollars 'cause like they'd never ever done it like between semesters before but it was so bad that like they had to do that and like people 'cause you paid your bill but then they sent you another bill like well we really need another like three hundred dollars 

558.72 559.94 A: [laughter] 

570.55 573.12 A: did you actually actually pay it because i would've 

571.03 571.81 B: (( although )) 

572.35 575.06 B: you have to i mean like you have 

573.98 579.87 A: i would've i would've like jammed that thing down my legislature's throat i had like in march 

576.56 577.28 B: they 

578.40 587.96 B: they actually they actually had um a few students that filed a lawsuit against it saying that it like it violated some law like contract between 

588.11 594.08 B: students and um and the university but the lawsuit got they didn't they didn't win it 

593.65 595.55 A: they didn't win the lawsuit 

595.33 596.51 B: (( [noise] no )) 

595.71 599.96 A: under what jurisdiction like i would have the same i would have tried and done something the same way
