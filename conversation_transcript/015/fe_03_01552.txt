119.85 123.32 B: yeah i remember the um 

124.11 127.42 B: the baseball strike a few years ago

133.32 134.61 B: terms 

134.62 139.42 B: of the strike but i know that um i read somewhere that their 

139.74 141.24 B: um fan 

141.34 145.33 B: like their fan base has really gone down since then 

145.45 146.85 A: right 

146.86 148.59 A: do you watch baseball 

148.56 151.23 B: um i used to when i was 

151.42 152.73 B: very young 

153.42 157.47 B: but um because the cleveland indians would um 

158.35 161.20 B: practice near my hometown 

161.07 161.94 A: right 

161.63 162.75 B: so um 

163.67 166.17 B: they used to people used to go watch 'em 

166.21 168.40 B: we'd watch the games and stuff 

168.53 172.58 A: i remember last time they were um going to go on strike that um 

172.68 175.42 A: a bunch of people they were going to lose their um 

175.55 179.42 A: their fans so um i think they settled 

179.90 182.44 B: right and when was this 

182.66 184.82 A: uh i think last year 

184.55 185.90 B: oh last year 

185.65 186.93 A: i think so 

186.94 188.18 B: yeah 

189.43 190.64 B: i don't know 

190.83 193.80 B: i don't know anything about last year um let 

196.32 199.23 A: i think the yankees make the most money 

199.05 201.58 B: me see probably but um 

203.36 204.50 B: didn't they 

204.71 206.86 B: i don't know didn't they just win something 

207.39 209.45 A: (( i don't know i'm not sure )) 

209.28 210.58 B: fairly recently 

209.46 214.80 A: but um they should uh donate some of their money to um other people 

215.11 219.64 A: that um i think um a million dollars is enough for one person 

215.18 216.24 B: yeah 

219.69 220.76 A: to live on 

221.19 224.37 B: yeah definitely um 

225.08 227.92 B: yeah but they make so much more than that 

227.61 232.56 A: oh i think they make millions like seventeen twenty thirty million 

232.88 234.15 B: yeah 

235.29 237.52 B: and i mean they can't really be 

237.70 240.75 B: being mistreated you know 

240.92 242.16 A: right 

242.16 245.07 B: so those are usually the terms of the strikes 

245.40 250.54 B: like just with people either being treated unfairly or it's money 

250.62 254.37 A: yeah i think it's more money than being unfairly treated 

254.17 255.71 B: yeah 

257.02 259.94 A: but they always want more money more money more money 

260.91 263.68 B: yeah that's horrible [laughter] 

264.62 266.75 A: [laughter] 

266.85 268.96 A: i could use some of that money 

269.28 272.01 B: yeah i think everybody could 

272.86 273.89 B: (( but um )) 

273.96 275.36 B: (( i don't know i think )) 

275.37 277.48 B: a lot of athletes do 

277.93 282.41 B: charity stuff i don't know much if they actually give money 

283.26 293.19 B: but i think they make appearances so that people can donate money to the um to the charity like other people you know and not them i don't think 

290.48 291.38 A: right 

293.40 297.08 A: i remember that one uh baseball player he's really snotty 

297.09 298.13 A: um 

298.68 300.43 A: to people when they meet him 

300.87 304.84 A: so i don't know how he would be uh involved in charities 

304.92 308.18 B: is he that one from um from atlanta 

308.09 309.57 A: (( yeah i think so )) 

308.55 310.01 B: a few years ago 

309.88 311.51 A: yeah i think so 

310.88 314.21 B: yeah i was living in atlanta when that whole thing was going on 

314.53 315.95 B: and it would be um 

316.20 319.62 B: on the local news like what everybody should do with him 

319.74 329.39 B: and they had people um calling in you know at the end of the newscast and voting whether we think that they should like kick him off the braves 

329.63 334.32 A: yeah you know sammy sosa and uh i don't know the other guy's name 

329.71 330.91 B: or not 

336.02 337.62 B: oh um 

341.11 343.52 B: are you talking about the guys that um 

344.23 346.78 B: hit all those baseballs in a row 

346.65 348.60 A: yeah yeah 

347.57 349.19 B: oh that was um 

349.39 351.92 B: [lipsmack] sammy sosa and mark maguire 

351.87 353.14 A: yeah 

352.39 353.85 B: i think yeah 

354.08 356.70 A: i think they said that maguire is snotty 

357.19 359.68 A: and sammy sosa was real nice 

359.58 362.73 B: oh maguire is real snotty i don't know 

362.98 364.35 B: i only um 

364.71 366.70 B: heard about it through like 

365.12 368.05 A: (( [noise] )) 

367.03 370.54 B: pop media you know that he was doing all that 

369.84 371.42 A: [noise] uh-huh 

372.98 375.73 B: i don't know i watched that episode of the simpsons 

374.88 375.77 A: [noise] 

375.83 380.16 B: [laughter] he appeared on [laughter] [laughter] 

376.27 377.91 A: [laughter] 

378.36 379.63 A: [laughter] 

380.86 381.98 B: um 

382.83 384.45 A: maybe they should um 

384.78 387.96 A: j- uh travel around and um give some of their money away 

389.15 392.04 B: yeah i don't know 

392.55 395.47 B: i think you have to be a certain kind of personality 

395.56 399.40 B: to be um an athlete and maybe 

400.03 405.53 B: a downfall of that personality is like you're so self absorbed you know 

405.26 409.84 A: yeah i mean it's got to be hard living that lifestyle i mean with 

409.88 417.80 A: people um swamping you all the time coming up to you for autographs and but that's what they chose so 

415.09 416.43 B: yeah 

417.51 420.98 B: well yeah it also seems like they don't really do anything 

421.02 426.42 B: um for like charities unless something specific has happened to them 

426.99 428.16 B: you know 

427.02 431.85 A: right yeah like if um they get cancer or something like that then 

431.16 432.76 B: right then 

431.89 434.93 A: all of a sudden they're donating millions of dollars 

434.43 437.06 B: yeah exactly 

438.37 444.82 B: which i mean i guess if you have the money then that's the thing to do but it just seems that also seems kinda 

446.27 447.92 B: like a fake reason 

448.26 449.49 A: yeah i mean 

448.54 452.16 B: you know just to to look like you're donating 

451.99 453.26 A: right 

452.69 453.78 B: (( for something )) 

453.57 461.15 A: a normal uh human being could live on like two million dollars and um they're walking around seventy five eighty million 

461.99 468.66 A: or i mean th- that um a person can live on two million for the rest of their life and they're walking around with 

466.28 467.52 B: yeah 

468.74 471.83 A: eighty million a hundred million in one year 

471.63 473.08 B: yeah 

473.13 475.12 A: so i think that's ridiculous 

474.55 477.64 B: oh no i would definitely not strike a job 

477.99 479.23 A: [laughter] no 

478.15 481.88 B: that was paying that kind of money i don't care [laughter] 

481.62 484.26 A: i think that's why they striked they wanted more money
