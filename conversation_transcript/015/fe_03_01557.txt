0.59 3.40 A: yeah hi my name is melissa 

3.21 5.19 B: and and mine is nadine 

5.56 6.53 A: hello 

6.22 10.09 B: hi and this is my first call so i'm a novice at this [laughter] 

10.16 12.59 A: oh well same here [laughter] 

11.50 19.23 B: oh good okay uh now they're talking about professional a- athletes and we're supposed to give our opinion is that correct 

18.73 19.99 A: yes 

19.28 21.15 B: striking i should say 

21.14 24.55 A: yeah well i think that um 

24.63 26.41 A: they make enough money 

26.70 27.99 A: as it is 

28.03 30.70 A: and them striking for more money 

28.13 28.75 B: (( [mn] )) 

31.19 36.40 A: is gonna make people not want to go to the games and it's not 'cause they're being selfish 

36.59 41.83 A: you know it's all it's supposed to be a sport entertainment for us you know for the people 

41.97 47.88 A: and i feel that they get paid i know they get paid contract you know money they get costs 

46.79 49.39 B: but they make a lot of money out of those contracts 

48.97 51.71 A: yes i think so ye- 

50.00 51.03 B: they do 

51.35 63.68 B: and i remember when they had the big strike oh i don't remember how long ago maybe seven ten years ago we had season tickets for the game and a lot of people did not pick up their season tickets after that 

63.58 70.55 B: because i really think as you said they make a lot of money and i realise they have a short career 

70.54 78.89 B: but i don't th- and the prices of everything goes up at the games it's very expensive to take a family to a game now to even go by yourself 

78.79 80.75 A: yes that's true 

80.86 92.76 A: so this whole strike it seems like um [lipsmack] when their contract is up or when a lot of 'em their contracts are up it seems like they go on strike 'cause they want more but they're not putting enough play into it 

92.77 98.76 A: you know like they're how you say they're losing their touch but they still want the same 

99.14 100.08 A: (( you know )) 

99.35 101.77 B: what do you mean you mean they don't play as well 

101.47 112.46 A: yeah like a lot of 'em okay they'll one year they get m._b._p. or something like that so yeah you expect them to get a lot but then they expect more and more and more you know 

102.84 103.59 B: ok- 

112.23 124.84 B: i think it's totally their salaries are out of control i really do all all sports are out of control maybe fights not [laughter] have their lights on if you consider boxing a a you know a sport 

115.56 116.54 A: [laughter] 

124.70 131.73 B: but i've never heard of boxers going out on strike and i really think it's i think it's really bad i think it's bad for the sport 

131.87 146.53 B: uh it's it's becam- it's become big business big business by the owners big business by the players big business by the people who sell uh [lipsmack] products from it i think the fact they in fact they charge for 

146.98 151.39 B: autographs is terrible i mean what happened to 

151.51 154.00 A: [sigh] all the support yes 

152.04 166.56 B: a tradition and and all the fun right i mean it- it's hard for me it's hard to understand how people could sit there and get excited over somebody that's making a million dollars for doing it i mean i realise it's a sh- as i said a short career 

154.25 155.36 A: yep 

166.49 169.68 B: but i think it's ridiculous i think that teachers 

169.70 174.10 B: could should strike and i don't think they should but they have more right to strike 

173.07 181.92 A: exactly exactly 'cause they're doing something for the community more or less if you don't want to watch sports you don't have to but you have to go to school 

174.21 175.38 B: than than 

176.82 178.15 B: that's right 

181.93 186.64 A: you you know you need your education so like that i understand too you 

183.52 185.09 B: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

185.97 198.66 B: and you need a good education i mean the so i i totally disagree with it and i don't know if there's anything that can be done about it now just this like the angels were just sold are you familiar with that story 

187.11 188.21 A: (( know yes )) 

193.39 194.39 A: yeah 

197.78 199.32 A: y- yes 

198.64 208.21 B: to a man i don't know how many millions he paid for the team well obviously he's gonna want his money back so he's not gonna be real anxious to pay the players 

208.26 213.69 B: more and yet they're gonna want it and it's the same old theme the more you have the more you want 

208.50 209.25 A: (( yeah )) 

214.05 215.43 A: exactly 

216.00 216.81 A: so 

217.33 218.72 A: um [sigh] 

219.16 220.92 A: so what else do we have to 

220.82 234.24 B: uh d- well i don't know discuss that but it's kinda we both agreed unfor- unfortunately [laughter] but maybe if one of us you know had a different point of view it'd be the end of it we did- we didn't we did agree 

226.73 227.84 A: yeah 

233.51 234.68 A: yep 

234.14 243.96 B: so there really isn't much more to say except what teams are going on strike now i i haven't been i've been watching the war too much to pay attention to sports so 

241.68 246.50 A: exact- ex- i see the other topic i could go into [laughter] 

245.77 258.17 B: but oh well yeah they they didn't they didn't ask us on that one unfortunately i could we could go round and round on that one probably but i mean w- do you know what sport's about supposed to be going on strike now or they just generally speaking 

248.23 249.91 A: i know [laughter] 

251.54 252.77 A: yeah 

258.66 262.45 A: i guess just a [sigh] a couple of people not like 

263.06 267.06 A: a not a lot of the players not a lot of the teams either 

264.72 265.74 B: mhm 

266.39 270.95 B: but one particular sport i've like i said i haven't been keeping up with sport 

269.62 273.07 A: oh n- uh i know i've been into the into the war also 

271.78 274.27 B: yeah right like everybody else 

274.47 275.29 A: (( yep )) 

274.87 281.80 B: sports kinda takes the back seat i hope they realize sports should take a back seat now there's too much else going on [lipsmack] 

281.33 286.21 A: yeah 'cause a lot of people are not interested in going to see sports right now you know 

285.40 287.30 B: that's right 

286.48 287.25 A: so 

287.61 293.92 B: and they get temperamental or they want more money but like i don't know what else we can say it's kind of s- sad 

293.74 296.33 A: yep straight to the point [laughter] 

294.56 295.63 B: for this one 

295.82 302.77 B: we made our point if we had unfortunately or fortunately we agreed i don't think we have much we can do about it 

302.62 304.01 A: yep 

304.56 305.70 A: (( so um d- )) 

306.76 312.54 A: [sigh] this is my yes this is my first call this is my first time doing [noise] this so

316.17 319.04 A: [laughter] and then after this what do we 

319.25 324.67 B: they've said they'd tell us when the ten minutes was up and we could make comments i hope they will contact us 

324.49 325.53 A: yeah 

324.68 326.36 B: probably on the internet

451.00 457.79 B: and i watched them win and it kinda got me back into it we used to do lakers a lot too i don't think they've ever struck 

457.54 458.48 A: (( [mn] )) 

458.12 462.95 B: i remember mostly the dodgers you know the baseball different baseball teams striking 

462.69 466.25 A: yeah but i don't i don't i don't i'm not into baseball

475.04 476.00 B: (( i don't i- )) 

475.13 483.14 A: no actually just like the drafts 'cause they're not making enough so they see who wants to offer more that's what a lot of 'em is there 

477.83 478.66 B: yeah they're 

480.58 481.47 B: right 

482.41 492.95 B: yeah but that that's legitimate i mean if they can get more someplace else or they can get dra- the that's set up pre-set up that's not quite the same as striking although i know they've 

492.88 498.37 B: i think they can refuse to be train- tr- uh transferred to another team 

496.82 497.70 A: yeah 

498.69 502.45 B: or traded is the word i was looking for i think they can be traded 

502.44 503.55 A: yeah 

502.80 512.54 B: to another team but i don't think i i don't remember them striking i like i as i said i was more into baseball so i would i'm very aware of the baseball strikes 

512.56 513.78 A: oh okay 

513.08 520.51 B: more so than anything else and i think they've striked more and i think they make too much money and we're back to square one on this 

520.30 521.38 A: (( yep )) 

522.19 524.41 A: has it been ten minutes huh

552.55 553.58 A: (( yep )) 

552.74 553.98 B: how to do it 

554.93 557.03 A: so all we do is get calls

562.41 565.74 B: and they said you can initiate a call by calling in 

566.20 567.60 A: oh you could 

566.96 571.63 B: yeah that the well they left a number i guess if they call you and you don't 

571.99 579.11 B: you know you're not home they left a message on the answer- answering machine that you could that you could call in but that's about i don't know how they do that either
