33.45 35.70 A: my opinion either way it i mean 

35.80 38.83 A: i guess they should get high

48.85 50.10 A: uh 

50.25 55.06 A: they are you know in publicity a lot so i guess they should get 

55.44 56.56 A: high pay 

57.27 60.50 B: [noise] i agree [noise] i agree i mean 

60.78 62.37 B: you should get it how you 

62.55 67.32 B: however you can get it you know it's not like somebody should be mad at them for making money 

67.33 69.25 A: i know like 

69.78 72.75 A: it's not like you're not working for the money it's like 

73.00 87.82 A: some people that just you know sit and it they get money for themselves or whatever you know they don't deserve it but sports people i i i know because like my sons play sports i personally don't play sports 

87.66 95.59 A: i watch football all the time but um i don't play but i know that they work their ass off you know 

95.64 96.81 A: just 

98.28 103.66 A: exercising and training and stuff like that and why shouldn't they get so much money 

103.81 107.52 A: and that's the lifestyle that that's 

107.81 110.44 A: you know the lifestyle that they're you know 

110.65 113.65 A: used to then they should get the money 

113.76 116.77 B: i agree with that like um 

117.32 129.42 B: they've they've sacrificed their bodies physically for it you know they forgo um a lot of times going to school or whatever they just do that sport and 

128.28 129.76 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

129.58 132.16 B: if they get picked up by a team and they make 

132.66 134.35 B: uh cash doing it 

134.37 136.13 B: more power to 'em 

136.23 141.09 B: i mean i don't think i don't think nobody should take it away from them or try to cap it off 

136.68 137.42 A: (( [noise] na- )) 

141.76 144.63 B: i wouldn't want nobody capping off my money if i was playing 

142.20 142.91 A: yeah 

144.58 145.99 A: [laughter] i know 

146.16 150.16 A: and is there like something going on about it is there like a 

150.33 155.68 A: like a dispute or whatever going on about it is that like why there's a survey or whatever 

155.67 159.96 B: i don't know i i don't personally even watch sport 

155.91 156.79 A: (( 'cause they )) 

159.84 161.40 A: oh you don't 

161.05 162.12 B: uh-uh 

162.36 163.21 A: (( mm )) 

163.42 164.16 A: 'cause 

164.62 167.25 A: i i haven't heard anything about 

167.42 174.58 A: there being like i don't know if like the media is criticizing or whatever and that's why they're having a survey 

174.66 178.80 A: on it now or whatever but it's it's kind of an unusual 

178.91 189.21 A: like topic to talk about 'cause yesterday i did a survey and it was about nine eleven and stuff like that and i can understand that but i don't know like 

186.39 187.26 B: (( uh-huh )) 

189.58 193.15 A: whether you know sports and you know 

194.72 195.99 A: (( i don't know i don't know )) 

194.75 202.31 B: yeah it must be it must be a strike of something going on where some it must some type of players that are striking for some more money or something 

202.90 207.14 A: which from there's players there are players striking for more money 

207.33 213.16 B: um i don't know that's usually what it when they go on strike they refuse to play because of something 

213.98 215.00 A: well 

216.02 217.53 A: okay i 

218.00 224.11 A: okay if that's the case then to a certain extent i can see them wanting to make 

224.19 232.37 A: money okay but when it's to the point where you're getting like two three million a year const- you know 

225.75 227.63 B: mhm 

232.72 246.54 A: guaranteed and you're going on strike because you want more i think that's getting a little bit greedy because there's people like me i put- i don't know your background but so i'm only going to speak for myself there's people like me who you know 

246.65 248.95 A: struggle you know with 

249.08 251.08 A: what we make a year 

251.10 259.92 A: and uh you know we live comfortably and if a player yeah they're sacrificing their body and stuff like 

259.99 274.16 A: but they should and they should get you know a high salary but you know if they're making like two som- two or more million dollars a year or whatever and they're not happy with that there's something 

274.16 278.23 A: there's something wrong 'cause that's getting a little bit greedy i think 

278.29 280.72 A: not even the president makes that much 

278.59 279.60 B: yeah 

280.96 290.77 B: yeah a lot of times when um when when sports people get that that big salary and they hold out for that it's because they it's not only them they're running a whole 

290.70 301.84 B: a whole like like som- like just let's say michael jordan for example he's probably got he's probably got a thousand people on payroll they get paid off of what he does 

295.54 296.95 A: mhm 

301.89 303.29 A: yeah 

303.07 316.62 B: so it's like when when you get into that limelight not only are you supporting your your family your extended family you have people who work for you who you support their families and a lot of times i mean 

315.38 316.08 A: true 

317.34 318.84 B: (( those dudes )) 

319.34 323.00 B: they they they they get the big money because they have big bills 

323.05 324.12 A: yeah 

323.17 331.10 B: they've gotta sup- support a lot a lot a a lot of mouths to feed when you when you get to doing that lawyers come into play there's 

331.37 340.35 B: people trying to sue you and and things like that when you i mean more money more problem 

334.66 335.77 A: yeah 

339.76 343.89 A: i no i totally agree but i think that 

345.07 359.03 A: you know i think like the okay the minimum amount that a newbie on a n._f._l. uh that a n._f._l. player makes you know fresh out of college right right on you know you know 

359.36 364.59 A: uh i i don't know what you call it i just call them new- you know new person 

364.75 369.78 A: is two million dollars a year okay and guaranteed 

364.79 366.50 B: (( right )) 

370.03 371.30 A: i mean 

371.55 377.87 A: come on ther- i i know there's you know a lot of people that they've gotta take of but for two million dollars 

378.15 384.37 A: you you gotta be happy with that and then there's other people that have been on the roster for like 

384.99 397.90 A: [sigh] over like five ten years that are making like thirty five forty million dollars a year and they're striking 'cause they're unhappy with that i don't i think that's 

398.00 399.32 A: like i can 

399.36 402.80 A: agree to a certain extent that they need money but uh 

403.11 404.60 A: (( i don't know i think )) 

404.96 406.08 A: that 

406.29 407.69 A: [noise] they're 

409.23 412.61 A: becoming greedy when they start asking for more 

413.19 414.35 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

413.28 417.75 B: who who are they asking for it i mean who'd they they asking for it 

418.42 419.63 A: what did you say 

418.66 431.92 B: to get more who are they asking to get more money from it's not like they're they're asking uh the community in general to pay their money it's like [mn] it's like these uh whoever owns the the the team 

432.45 433.69 A: yeah 

433.95 437.33 A: and see that's taking also that's also taking away from 

437.51 449.45 A: the manager and the owner [noise] and stuff like that because if they stri- i know the manager and the owner really all they do is you know manage and own it and the players are the same but 

449.77 458.36 A: you know it takes a lot to be a manager of especially of sports and stuff like that it takes a lot to do that and 

458.45 466.25 A: it takes when they go on strike and [noise] they want more money it takes a lot out of them i think a lot a lot more money from the 

463.82 465.14 B: (( [noise] oh definitely )) 

467.14 468.58 B: (( definitely so )) 

469.31 470.19 A: pardon 

470.29 472.14 B: i said definitely so 

472.59 473.50 A: and then 

472.79 475.32 B: i think i think there should be uh 

475.53 480.49 B: a reasonable amount of money spread the wealth should be spread amongst the people 

480.46 491.75 B: there's a lot of people that are very super rich that can never their families will never their lineage will never run out of money and here's people who are very poor and there's not 

480.62 481.47 A: yeah 

488.23 489.01 A: mhm 

491.18 492.34 A: yeah 

491.89 493.79 B: much middle ground in between 

494.71 503.77 A: i think that they should be required to give so- uh well maybe not required but i think that on a moral note they should give 

504.40 511.61 A: their they should give money to charity and stuff like that too because they are making so much money a year 

512.34 513.33 A: you know 

512.69 513.55 B: if you 

513.51 515.30 A: why not just help out 

513.58 514.67 B: if you make 

515.80 518.30 B: if you make a million dollars in a year 

518.44 523.73 B: you're you're gonna pay at least half a million in taxes so you're starting out with half a million 

524.74 525.62 A: true 

526.20 537.63 B: there's uh there's there's no way ifs ands and buts about it that you're going to gonna get at least forty perce- at the least forty percent taken out [noise] of your if you make the money [noise] legally 

537.65 540.07 B: you're gonna get forty percent taken so you're 

540.04 545.98 B: so say you start off with a million i personally myself i've seen a million dollars come and go 

545.85 556.71 B: i've seen it in the tour budget and uh a million dollars is is a million dollars is a piddle a million dollars is uh a brand new band somebody in investments 

548.73 549.63 A: (( well )) 

556.74 559.84 B: you can you can piddle out a million dollars in a three months tour 

562.41 569.54 B: if you've got five people in a band and it's its a million dollars isn't it's not really a lot 

562.72 563.57 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

565.23 566.23 A: yeah 

569.91 575.42 B: it's a lot to me if i had it a million in my pocket but there's a lot of 

574.53 581.40 A: i guess after taxes and stuff like that and expenses but it's for personal use though isn't it 

582.00 587.01 A: i mean are we talking a million after taxes or are we talking a million pre tax 

587.15 595.39 B: if you were to get a million dollars you would start off with a half a million because half of it would get taxed before you even got a chance to do anything with it 

596.04 599.89 A: isn't the maximum that they can tax you like thirty two percent
