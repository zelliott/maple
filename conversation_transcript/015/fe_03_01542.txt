15.53 19.47 B: [laughter] [laughter] how did you know you are very good 

18.79 31.92 A: well we have a lot of um service people in the area and and i've travelled quite extensively so some of the accents you pick up pretty quick you know yeah yeah some are more pronounced than others of course you know 

22.22 23.19 B: uh-huh 

26.87 28.88 B: oh really okay 

31.24 35.31 B: okay well i guess you can tell from my accent 

34.77 37.65 A: yeah yeah well somewhat somewhat you know 

35.84 36.78 B: [laughter] 

36.81 43.59 B: yeah hi um i think our today's topic is the strike on athletes 

43.20 44.33 A: yes 

44.39 47.06 A: yes i think they get paid way too much 

44.40 45.65 B: (( what do you )) 

46.71 48.76 B: [laughter] that's what i think too [mn] 

47.51 54.49 A: i real- i do they get paid way too much and um they actually perform a service to this country 

54.51 56.63 A: as far as uh 

57.36 62.13 A: what they do because too many other people depend on them performing 

62.49 66.44 A: and i don't think they should strike i really don't 

65.60 70.38 B: they shouldn't i oh well what i thinking is that 

70.75 75.30 B: once you get paid so much you feel you have the privilege 

75.28 80.35 B: you have the right to get all you want but it's not true a lot of people 

80.33 91.59 B: the people who paid them to watch them perf- you know like um the w- to watch all those athletes are the person who are supporting their salary 

87.52 88.42 A: right 

91.22 103.60 A: oh the- definitely in fact they've priced themselves some of the fans that used to take their kids and stuff that i know personally they can't afford to go to a ball game 'cause to take themselves and child is the best part of two hundred dollars 

103.40 112.01 B: yeah i unders- i know that and then they are striking that means they are kind of biting the hand that feed them [laughter] 

111.12 124.31 A: right and they're putting all these other people out of work and inconveniencing them and everything else i i really don't believe that they should strike they have no reason to strike to begin with they've got they've bargained they've made their contracts 

124.34 130.16 A: and if they're not happy that's too bad next time you know don't sign your contract if you don't like it 

130.11 133.15 B: yeah they they they are not like uh they uh 

130.66 132.10 A: you know i mean 

132.93 146.81 B: got forced into this job they don't have any choices that that or the company is going bankrupted you now that's no- nothing of pride to them it's like [laughter] it's like they're abusing a privi- privilege too much 

139.27 140.26 A: right 

146.17 151.12 A: they are they are they just think that they're above everything and anybody um 

151.19 159.76 A: and i think we have placed way too much emphasis on sports in this country to the point where even in school 

159.89 163.44 A: sports take uh precedence over 

163.45 168.90 B: the the curriculum yeah yeah that's what i feel too 

163.51 167.83 A: uh the the educational part yes and 

168.26 172.81 A: yeah and they're not role models anymore for the most part the and 

172.40 176.71 B: who who say they are role model i heard so many sports persons 

175.80 178.27 A: all the bad stuff that and 

176.92 179.44 B: yeah they they have you know like 

178.39 181.66 A: i mean they're human so you can expect that 

181.46 187.60 B: they i i always feel they once they get into the spotlight then i feel they are god 

187.50 191.08 A: well they they're not god because first of all they're men 

188.22 189.28 B: [laughter] 

190.91 191.95 B: yeah 

191.71 204.86 A: okay so i mean men [mn] i mean you don't hear the stuff about women going on women are al- or if if it is going on they're a little more discreet you know they're not flaunting it um 

197.83 199.79 B: [laughter] 

201.81 203.34 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

204.64 212.85 B: do do you remember once um they have one thing that if the history was controlled by women they don't have that much war 

212.58 222.21 A: well that's true that's true i mean [sigh] it's it's crazy but i i think like you that the striking bit has gotten out of hand i mean 

222.13 228.63 A: they have managers and they have business managers that sit down and go over these contracts line by line 

228.65 231.80 A: uh to the point where it's nauseam 

231.82 232.91 A: uh 

233.12 234.55 A: to hear them 

233.17 236.75 B: they probably have lawyers who go through them too 

235.05 242.00 A: oh they they do they have lawyers and business managers and unless unless the owners 

239.07 240.70 B: accountants 

242.22 244.11 A: uh actually 

244.24 255.46 A: violate that contract that they don't live up to the contract i mean if they say that they're going to put them in a four star hotel and they put them in some motel six in the back woods 

255.83 260.63 A: yeah they can get upset but to me that's not a reason to strike 

259.56 261.87 B: (( you you know you know you get )) 

260.83 265.18 A: i mean that's just a disagreement that's something that can be ironed out between two 

265.08 265.98 B: yeah 

265.24 267.33 A: average brained adults 

266.95 275.71 B: ye- ye- let's do it this way if you right now the economy is really going down you know it's in in a pretty bad situation 

275.33 276.37 A: oh yeah 

275.52 286.66 B: and you if a company that is in business they have employee in their business and they say okay the company is not making money well today when you go out we are not going to 

286.47 290.78 B: put you in a four star hotel we are going to put you in a motel six 

290.33 291.34 A: right 

290.85 296.36 B: that's no the employees say go on strike say no no no we have to get 

295.26 296.55 A: i mean i 

296.60 301.76 A: they would be glad that they're that the company is even picking up the tab for that 

300.79 303.44 B: yeah yeah that's true 

301.73 314.98 A: you know yeah i just think that they have gotten to the point where they just they demand the the baseball players are just demanding and they expect everything to be handed to them and i don't think that's right i mean 

314.94 316.72 B: (( they gonna spoil it )) 

315.02 326.07 A: there's too many people in there's too many people in this country that are going without and here they are flaunting the millions and millions they get guaranteed they have a talent yes 

322.69 324.20 B: [laughter] 

326.28 334.74 A: and guaranteed they have to practise and everything else but there are other people that have just as much talent in different fields uh but 

334.88 338.78 B: they don't get paid so much and they don't go into strike too 

336.38 337.33 A: right 

338.51 344.91 A: right right they're just allowed to be able to have they they should just be glad that they have a job that pays that kind of money you know 

344.69 355.44 B: i think the whole thing is they really to spoil it like like the sports complex we have to build for those athletes and then they have the taxpayer to pick up the tab 

350.89 351.74 A: oh 

351.89 352.95 A: oh i know 

355.50 365.90 B: because they have to have this they have to have that in order to perform good well it's not that i disagree with them it's that everything has a limit 

365.34 367.05 A: oh yeah definitely 

365.71 377.76 B: if you keep on going the sky is the limit so then when are you going to stop you always can find things fault in the whole situation you can find this fault find that fault okay fine 

376.88 380.27 A: oh yes everything has has it's has it's drawbacks 

378.54 381.25 B: life is not perfect [laughter] 

380.37 386.11 A: n- no if it was perfect uh nothing would it would be boring actually if anything was perfect 

384.62 385.49 B: yeah 

385.85 386.91 B: yeah 

386.28 392.91 A: but i mean they keep asking for more and more so the ticket prices have to go up so the attendance goes down 

391.10 392.24 B: yeah 

392.80 406.50 A: i mean at some point in time there's not going to be any need for these massive stadiums because only the super rich or the companies can afford to have boxes and even the companies i don't believe are buying as many uh seasonal boxes 

406.06 407.59 B: [noise] well even 

407.79 419.54 B: uh last time i went to see a football or some uh uh a basketball or something well i got somebody give me the tickets and one day i have to pay fifteen dollars for the parking 

412.47 413.57 A: mhm 

415.55 416.42 A: yeah 

419.37 420.33 A: yeah 

419.74 421.19 B: (( and i was [laughter] )) 

420.55 428.57 A: yeah so now if the if the if the fans aren't going then the parking attendants aren't making money the the concession people aren't make money 

425.47 426.39 B: yeah 

426.93 437.58 B: yeah 'cause that if you spend so much money you go in there you are thinking oh what am i going to buy maybe i should buy less in the confection stand then my kids starve a little bit 

437.23 451.11 A: yeah yeah and then everybody starts bringing in their own candy in their pockets and stuff like that you know i mean i know they frown on that they do in the movie theatres too but i mean it gets to be a little bit ridiculous when the popcorn costs more than the movie ticket 

437.88 438.77 B: you know 

442.97 443.92 B: yeah 

450.55 453.80 B: (( [laughter] yeah that's that's what exactly )) 

451.18 455.99 A: you know i mean and that's basically that's basically what's starting to happen 

456.05 464.36 B: then you you start to not everybody has one a family have to share one bag instead of everybody have a little bag you know 

463.49 465.04 A: yeah you know 

464.39 468.24 B: well this thing gets more and more mhm 

467.25 472.86 A: yeah i i just don't feel that they're in a position to be striking no more than 

472.99 474.01 A: uh 

474.34 477.41 A: health care workers should strike and i 

478.04 483.04 A: i i really incensed when i see some of that because when you're doing a service job 

483.39 492.18 A: you just you know unless conditions are so bad that you can't work and then that becomes a governmental issue or a governing 

492.43 505.70 A: agency issue that doesn't become uh taking the right to walk out i i don't know i just think that strikes sometimes don't do what they are intended to do and nobody wins with a strike especially 

503.86 512.75 B: yeah it's a lot of people lose and economic lose too you know the government is losing tax money by all those strikes 

508.38 509.68 A: of course 

512.67 520.10 A: oh yes definitely definitely because all that admission money isn't getting spent and being taxed [sigh] oh yeah 

517.34 518.26 B: yeah 

519.06 526.19 B: and then if if the people is coming from you know other towns to go to this town to watch the sports and that's 

525.08 526.31 A: right i mean 

526.27 531.41 B: (( what are they going to do they spend all this money beforehand and got here and then it gone )) 

530.62 541.21 A: right especially if they have to make arrangements and reservations at hotels and stuff like that uh you know for some of these big events and a lot of times that money is not refundable 

533.57 534.58 B: yeah 

538.06 539.00 B: yeah 

540.55 542.03 B: they will 

541.21 548.55 A: you know i mean and it's really a shame because everybody like you say everybody loses so no i don't think they have the right to strike 

542.47 543.58 B: and then there's 

547.30 555.59 B: i i you you speaking of strike i remember um about ten or ten or twelve years they have a company in san francisco 

555.52 569.96 B: and uh they have unions in their corporation in the manufacturing facility and the uni- union kept on demanding more and more and more and to a degree that they demand that uh the the people who clean the bathroom 

558.79 559.86 A: mhm 

569.72 570.64 A: mhm 

569.98 579.49 B: you know those c- custodians they have to have a minimum pay of twenty twenty dollars i was talking about ten ten years ago 

572.67 573.57 A: yeah 

579.20 580.16 A: yeah 

579.55 591.06 B: ten twelve years ago so twenty dollars is quite a bit for custodian they if you can hire people minimum wage to do those things but because of the union they do that and after 

591.51 594.78 B: a while company feel like they got fed up 

594.58 595.55 A: mhm 

594.83 598.00 B: so they shut the whole things down and moved colorado 

597.74 599.25 A: yeah yeah 

598.42 599.89 B: [laughter] that's what
