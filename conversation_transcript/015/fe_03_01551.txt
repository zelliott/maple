188.72 189.79 A: mhm 

190.93 196.34 A: yeah i think but i i used to always think that that was because they was doing that like as a tax write off

531.92 532.90 B: yes 

536.57 541.80 B: well i really think they participate in more things that we never hear about

542.09 543.98 B: i do yes 

543.36 544.34 A: uh-huh

564.05 566.23 B: yes they do yes they do 

565.74 576.99 A: people but i was just saying that i was i thought maybe like they should spend more of their money you know towards that they do a lot for the children but you i you don't hear them saying a lot about the elderly 

566.35 567.40 B: because you- 

576.41 578.02 B: that's what i'm looking 

577.20 582.63 A: and i was and i was concerned about that just because of what we went through l- recently 

579.84 580.40 B: (( [cough] )) 

582.39 593.76 B: oh really yeah but me i'm i i could use a little help too but i mean i think they should because you know the elderly after all everybody's gonna get old 

582.73 583.58 A: so 

587.20 588.42 A: mhm 

593.64 594.68 A: right 

594.12 597.71 B: and they have to realize that and uh
