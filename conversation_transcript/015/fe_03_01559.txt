37.42 38.26 B: yeah 

38.37 49.30 B: multiple millions over like two years i've forgot some of the contacts that wasn't on my mind right now but it's so high i mean just for two years you know somebody can make

63.97 66.58 A: okay i'm in um washington state 

66.43 75.29 B: okay we have turner field and the braves and all those people come and th- the salaries are so high like a hotdog you know 

75.68 86.32 A: yeah i mean to go to to go to the game it's like forty bucks for a ticket and you know five bucks for a hotdog and it's outrageous all because these guys are getting way too much money 

79.72 81.06 B: yeah 

86.07 88.54 B: yeah i think that um [mn] 

89.52 102.03 B: i [sigh] i don't know it's just too high and then they you know when they get to talking about that stuff they actually go by the whole uh roster of of how much the roster call to run costs to run the team 

102.26 109.20 B: and when you look at some of the guys just playing like i guess triple a. or double a. or however they got to divide it 

109.49 117.78 B: those guys they their um [lipsmack] annual payroll or whatever however they do they the roster right is like a fraction 

118.33 119.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

118.34 126.58 B: of whatever these super guys get see what i'm saying so one of those guy's salary almost will cover maybe a half

134.83 136.48 B: (( so i don't know )) 

135.62 142.84 A: you know what really makes me angry is the ones that are getting the big bucks and so they're role models for the kids they're out you know 

142.86 151.06 A: doing drugs and getting in bar fights and instead of like you know being role models like the portland trailblazers

375.34 376.45 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

376.15 388.99 B: duh but i mean those things are okay but it's just the idea the prices are so high and it it it cuts out a certain segment of the population you either you just won't be able to go it's just that simple 

388.23 389.71 A: yeah 

389.26 392.19 B: or you go once in twenty years 

393.45 401.57 B: [lipsmack] personally i don't follow the stuff that close to even go i might watch golf boxing and stuff like that on t._v. but as far as 

394.19 395.03 A: (( absolutely )) 

401.74 402.74 B: you know 

402.32 406.81 A: yeah but you could've even af- afford to go to a boxing or a golf game any more 

406.28 419.90 B: uh-huh no and most of the golf games that you want to see are already like [laughter] like a masters ticket you need one of those thirty years before the damn game you don't know whose playing in it when you buy the ticket actually 

413.80 414.59 A: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

419.40 420.62 A: [noise] 

419.98 426.30 B: you know the passes i used to live in augusta and there was like frenzies over that stuff 

426.06 427.74 A: [noise] wow 

426.55 440.86 B: but that's too high too because they well that's not as high as baseball and basketball and football and football's not high as basketball and baseball but baseball is the highest 

431.98 432.69 A: (( [noise] )) 

432.99 434.05 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

436.51 438.97 A: oh yeah oh 

440.49 445.05 A: yeah it's to go to go to a um mariner's game up here it's like 

445.63 447.95 A: thirty five bucks for a ticket 

447.85 449.12 B: wow 

449.03 450.19 A: yeah 

450.43 459.16 A: and you know basketball i mean you can get some blazer tickets now for like ten bucks but that's that's 'cause y- i mean they're bad season nobody's going to games 

458.93 460.31 B: oh okay 

459.71 461.80 A: i mean i mean they're they're 

461.99 469.27 A: um people going to games up here just aren't happening anymore personally because the blazers keep getting into so much trouble 

468.84 469.91 B: uh-huh 

470.08 471.17 A: that's really 

470.16 473.77 B: that's the trailblazers right the portland trailblazers 

471.82 472.67 A: (( yeah )) 

473.33 474.24 A: (( yeah )) 

474.39 479.55 A: actually i refer to 'em as the portland jail blazers because they keep going to jail 

477.51 484.63 B: (( [laughter] [mn] oh my goodness )) 

484.65 490.40 B: so they i haven't been following it to be honest so they're what way down the thing now 

486.27 486.83 A: (( [noise] )) 

490.27 500.15 A: oh yeah they're uh i mean there's some good players on for the blazers but i mean they've got a bunch of a bunch of losers right now that just can't get it together 

493.94 495.37 B: (( yeah i know )) 

500.82 508.40 B: i think them things go around in circles 'cause one time it's the sixers and the next time it's the lakers and they all 

508.04 509.20 A: oh yeah 

509.04 517.90 B: and then the you know we they all seem like dished up in the spotlight for a second and then it's like d- downhill from there and then it's uphill then it's downhill 

515.73 516.59 A: yeah 

517.59 520.93 A: and then they use all their millions to buy themselves out of trouble 

521.36 522.88 B: well that's true 

522.55 523.72 A: (( yep )) 

523.14 532.88 B: some of the stuff i mean one guy got caught a couple of years ago he was down here in atlanta and they all come to atlanta to show their behinds for some reason 

531.99 534.28 A: [laughter] 

533.56 545.02 B: you know when the golf club thing was going on and all this they all were stuck down here and they all do what they do but one guy claimed he got lost in a uh uh um 

534.93 536.04 A: (( [lipsmack] [laughter] )) 

545.03 545.59 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

546.11 556.28 B: well this area known for drugs and prostitute he claims his lights went out and he didn't know where he was at his lights went out on his car now you know the car was like big and 

555.32 558.21 A: yeah yeah a fifty thousand dollar car 

557.31 564.86 B: yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean my lights on my bicycle would go out quicker than his lights on his car 

565.64 567.04 B: [cough] but anyway 

567.26 568.72 B: [lipsmack] that's um 

569.84 580.26 B: i think it is should be representative of of how the guy is for real you know but i guess it it takes money to make money though [noise] 

580.42 587.15 A: [noise] well you know they can make a lot more money if they quit giving one guy ten million dollars for a year of playing basketball 

586.97 589.07 B: yeah we won't see it though 

588.90 592.51 A: probably not [lipsmack] but i think they should do some reforms 

590.28 591.22 B: (( sure )) 

592.96 595.02 A: definitely need some reforms 

594.02 599.95 B: maybe they should though i mean they having caps and stuff for shit
