187.21 188.79 B: mhm 

187.49 199.47 A: but for god's sake you know we voted for the teachers to get the money to you know it passed but the teachers they took some other stuff out so actually they ended up with less money than they should be getting

201.33 202.55 B: yeah 

201.92 211.73 A: you know that that we put athletes on top of teachers which you know if it wasn't for teachers some of these kids would not be where they're at right now
