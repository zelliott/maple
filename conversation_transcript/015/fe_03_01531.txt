11.86 13.38 B: go ahead 

12.78 18.50 A: okay is that um how do you feel about strikes or about how much they make if it's fair right 

18.31 19.24 B: uh-huh 

19.14 23.52 A: okay well i think athletes are definitely overpaid 

23.61 25.40 B: yes they are [laughter] 

24.77 34.88 A: [laughter] i think [laughter] that they're paid way too much and any money that they like who who i think instead should be making so much money is like 

25.70 26.94 B: definitely 

34.88 40.14 A: more nurses and peop- yes teachers definitely too 

36.80 37.92 B: teachers 

40.12 50.52 A: i think nurses and teachers are pretty much the main people that should be over should be paid much more than they are right now i think our athletes are definitely overpaid um they you 

40.23 41.92 B: right 

50.48 57.14 A: know like i understand that you know that they probably don't see their families very often because they are travelling or whatever but i still don't think they deserve all 

55.81 57.60 B: that comes with the job though 

57.32 61.03 A: yeah and i don't think they deserve the millions of dollars that they make [laughter] 

60.28 61.37 B: i don't either 

61.17 64.83 A: [laughter] so i guess we're in agreement there [laughter] 

64.12 71.36 B: yeah i can't see that playing baseball or football or basketball or whatever 

71.98 74.08 B: can pay so much i mean 

74.23 77.76 B: in most states education 

77.89 81.59 B: is way underrated way underpaid 

80.54 83.12 A: right yep i agree 

82.73 88.87 B: we've shut down in the past two years we've shut down and three or four schools in our school system 

88.74 89.79 A: wow 

89.16 90.92 B: and we're having to merge 

91.29 94.72 B: like one elementary school with another you know so 

93.70 95.52 A: just because of teachers 

95.24 96.21 B: right 

95.64 98.08 A: not enough teachers yeah that's awful 

97.52 103.07 B: well there's not so much that there's not enough teachers there's just not enough money to keep these schools open 

102.80 104.78 A: yeah i see what you're saying 

104.76 105.80 B: so 

105.82 107.09 A: where are you from 

106.84 108.05 B: oklahoma 

107.86 110.19 A: oklahoma i'm from dallas texas 

110.30 111.28 B: wow 

111.17 112.70 A: [laughter] 

111.85 115.52 B: that's the first time i've got anybody on these calls that's even near me 

115.26 119.13 A: oh really yeah last time i had someone from detroit i think 

116.04 117.60 B: yeah most people are 

119.08 122.88 B: right um i had someone yesterday from pennsylvania 

122.67 123.86 A: oh wow 

123.57 128.85 B: and they were like are you from west virginia um no [laughter] i'm from oklahoma 

125.72 128.33 A: (( [laughter] )) 

128.99 130.27 A: yeah 

129.02 129.84 B: and 

130.19 134.21 B: you know we've had several athletes come from oklahoma 

134.04 135.28 A: yeah 

134.68 138.99 B: and go on to dallas i mean dallas is my favorite football team 

138.57 140.87 A: [laughter] the cowboys 

140.39 141.42 B: yes 

141.19 142.25 A: yes 

141.87 144.50 B: and when they got rid emmett smith i was so happy 

144.40 145.81 A: [laughter] 

145.09 154.13 B: i just you know i felt he was dragging 'em down but i thought okay he's gonna go to this other team and they're gonna double the salary he was making with dallas 

147.76 148.67 A: uh-huh 

153.79 154.84 A: yeah 

154.20 157.72 B: and he was already one of the highest paid football players 

157.34 158.30 A: right 

158.20 159.76 B: in the whole n._f._l. 

160.18 162.57 B: you know i i don't understand that 

162.00 163.48 A: yeah i don't either 

163.39 164.43 B: and 

163.60 171.44 A: because because you know i mean i understand like you know the ones bringing in sales or whatever people coming to watch these great players or whatever but 

171.22 181.47 A: i still don't think that the should be paid all that money or if they are i think like i know a lot of athletes do like donate money to charity but not nearly as much as they probably should you know 

181.11 184.68 B: i think they donate enough to charity to get a tax break 

184.32 189.25 A: right and then that's for people to say hey we do give some of our money to charity but 

188.92 189.79 B: right 

189.50 196.33 A: i don't think it's nearly as much as people should i mean i can't pinpoint and say it's this athlete or that athlete because i really don't know 

196.16 204.94 A: my statistics to say oh he gives this much but i know the majority of players are not giving enough money to people that deserve the money you know 

203.99 206.46 B: right and and it's funny that 

206.34 220.49 B: you can't hardly pinpoint someone 'cause i i agree with you on that you can't hardly pinpoint someone as to who's giving to charity and who isn't but it's easy to pinpoint those who are leading the strike for more pay 

210.98 211.84 A: (( yeah )) 

215.77 216.75 A: right 

220.35 221.38 A: right 

220.92 231.68 B: those who are out there in media saying look you know i get out of here and throw a ball round so that makes me a multi millionaire and i'm not making enough money so give me some more 

228.13 229.18 A: right 

231.58 232.53 A: right 

232.00 233.76 B: and i think that's ridiculous 

233.62 235.61 A: i do too [laughter] 

234.43 247.71 B: and i think that they could get out there and play the same type of football or the same type of basketball or whatever sport on the same income that a teacher or a nurse makes 

246.38 247.14 A: yep 

247.60 248.91 A: i agree too 

248.62 251.65 B: they make more than the president of the united states 

251.34 253.87 A: (( do they [laughter] insane )) 

253.63 256.54 B: yeah he makes an average i wanna say 

257.69 259.88 B: of a hundred thousand dollars a year 

259.67 260.56 A: wow 

260.74 261.81 B: where 

261.05 264.00 A: that's not the while they make millions and billions 

263.62 265.02 B: exactly 

264.86 267.69 A: that's crazy yes i don't agree 

265.98 267.16 B: and 

268.06 269.81 B: there's never 

269.97 270.95 B: food 

271.06 272.19 A: right 

271.60 275.86 B: in a lot of cities the homeless shelters are overrun 

273.17 274.05 A: right 

275.79 276.78 A: right 

276.54 280.13 B: and these guys are running around and the women too 

280.12 281.11 A: right 

280.14 289.60 B: the women too and they're running around screaming i don't make enough money so i'm not gonna play until you give me more and they'll always get more money 'cause 

286.56 287.55 A: yeah 

288.90 289.96 A: right 

289.88 290.87 B: it's it's 

290.24 292.64 A: 'cause they can't afford to not have them play 

292.32 294.80 B: right it's a multi million dollar industry 

292.98 293.97 A: but 

294.91 295.90 A: right 

295.96 298.79 B: and i think education should be 

298.82 299.96 A: number one 

299.55 300.48 B: right 

300.44 301.62 A: i agree 

300.52 312.48 B: the- they're trying to pass a lottery here in oklahoma so that more money can go towards funding education and there are a lot people opposing it and you know i'm one of those that will say well 

312.41 316.05 B: our taxpayers will just keep going to texas or kansas or 

316.56 320.86 B: louisiana or whatever to spend their money instead of putting it back into the state 

316.73 317.59 A: mhm 

320.99 322.36 A: mhm 

321.73 323.85 B: so they're trying to make it to where 

325.24 329.19 B: anything generated by the lottery will go directly to education 

329.17 330.31 A: yeah 

329.71 332.11 B: i think that'll help to a point 

333.07 348.05 A: yeah and i remember when lottery started that's what it was meant for like the percentage of it was supposed to go towards education but i remember seeing i don't know if it's still like that but i know a lot people weren't a lot of people in the education field weren't even seeing that money even though it was supposedly made for that purpose 

347.68 348.54 B: right 

349.10 353.27 B: see that's the one and only purpose they're wanting it here and 

349.10 349.94 A: but 

352.19 353.24 A: yeah 

353.62 367.63 B: you figure you know the athletes they've got a better shot at hitting the millions by joining up [mn] in college or high school or whatever hoping to get a pro career than any one person does hitting it in the lottery 

360.61 361.48 A: yeah 

364.24 365.20 A: right 

367.59 368.71 A: i agree 

369.27 370.95 A: i agree with you totally 

371.77 379.12 B: and unfortunately the united states don't have a whole lot doing the soccer and that's the biggest sport we have in this area of oklahoma 

378.37 380.43 A: yeah soccer 

379.13 381.19 B: that's soccer mhm 

380.93 392.23 A: well we've got the mavericks we've got the cowboys we've got the stars we've got like you know a good amount of people but you know still i don't hear anything extraordinary about these people that 

392.22 398.19 A: you know about the amounts of money they're giving to charity or the amounts of money they're giving towards education or anything 

396.10 396.84 B: (( mhm )) 

398.46 400.34 B: nope not at all 

400.41 401.70 A: yeah 

401.64 404.13 B: and i think it's absolutely ridiculous 

404.03 405.14 A: i agree 

405.96 408.63 B: i think too it's going to be real controversial 

408.84 409.99 A: yeah 

409.41 412.86 B: the subject they're putting out because they're gonna find some 

413.67 418.27 B: big football players somewhere that's just gonna go nuts and 

417.46 424.79 A: yeah and really sports is not a necessary you know the sports industry is not really a necessary industry you know like 

424.27 424.92 B: (( uh-uh )) 

424.82 437.21 A: these kids you know where did they get their education from school they have something to fall back on what happens when these athletes get hurt they pretty much have to reply on whatever education they've had already because you know they're not going to go too far 

434.89 436.07 B: and 

436.17 436.83 B: right 

437.23 441.87 B: well like with michael irving with the dallas cowboys he had 

437.39 438.43 A: and 

439.91 440.73 A: uh-huh 

441.94 444.81 B: this serious [mn] neck injury 

445.22 448.13 B: and they said that one more hit could kill him 

448.11 449.05 A: right 

448.89 450.29 B: or tory aitman 

450.47 452.04 B: he had to get out 

450.62 451.36 A: (( yeah )) 

452.11 454.42 B: because he had so many concussions 

454.16 455.10 A: right 

454.92 457.65 B: and he was complaining you know well 

457.99 464.89 B: i don't have enough money to retire right now though [laughter] you make millions of dollars a year if you don't have enough that's your fault 

464.12 467.19 A: i know just sell one of your houses you have plenty [laughter] 

466.91 467.92 B: right 

467.89 468.69 A: but 

469.12 470.09 B: (( i mean we )) 

469.22 474.50 A: yeah it is ridiculous um i don't understand how they don't see it's ridiculous amounts of money 

474.35 487.84 A: um i don't see how they can't give you know like yeah i'm sure they're giving like hundreds or thousands of dollars but what about like the millions that you get you know think about how much good it could do in education system or how much it could do in the health care system you know 

487.66 488.68 B: right 

487.99 491.34 A: for people that can't afford health care and you know really need it 

491.05 491.95 B: right 

491.91 492.70 A: but 

492.16 497.09 B: well they have a football player with the kansas city chiefs uh derek comet 

497.13 497.98 A: uh-huh 

497.94 500.06 B: bought a real fancy 

500.10 501.51 B: fast car 

501.55 502.31 A: uh-huh 

501.60 503.67 B: with all the money that he had 

503.98 506.42 B: wreck it killed himself 

506.47 507.31 A: wow 

507.23 509.54 B: and all the money that he had 

509.87 515.86 B: didn't go you know he didn't have it marked to be donated like to a school or 

513.33 514.09 A: uh-huh 

515.95 518.14 B: an organization or whatever 

518.28 523.75 B: and it's all he's been dead for almost ten years and it's all still tied up in probate 

523.04 523.90 A: yeah 

523.92 524.92 B: so 

525.66 531.75 B: i i think something needs to be done with it i think they need to quit caving in all these strikes these people are 

528.23 529.34 A: yeah i do too 

530.95 531.89 A: yeah 

531.97 533.41 B: putting on and 

532.26 532.94 A: (( i )) 

534.04 540.04 A: think maybe if people took a strike on going to the uh games and you know like 

540.10 543.46 A: going to see these sports players who make all the money and there's 

543.34 557.86 A: which are the reason why i think we could prevent a lot of the money that they're getting to not you know not in such large quantities if we were to strike somehow but that's that's not ever gonna happen because there are too many sports fans including myself you know i'm a sport's fan too 

553.69 554.57 B: no 

557.84 566.40 A: and you know but it's not it's not realistic it's not a realistic idea even though that might help help with the money issues uh-huh 

566.50 570.72 B: we had tickets to see the dallas cowboys play a few years ago 

571.19 577.16 B: and they were talking about going on strike because they didn't make enough money this is back when dion sanders played for 'em 

576.86 578.60 A: yeah i remember that 

577.47 579.86 B: we sold our tickets we didn't even go 

579.89 581.05 A: yeah 

581.10 582.08 B: so 

582.15 585.80 B: you know i told my husband i said i'm not going to be a part of this i'm not gonna 

585.88 590.84 B: spend my money and go watch these idiots play 

590.86 593.71 A: yeah when they don't deserve making money 

593.27 596.46 B: right you know and my son 

597.05 599.89 B: almost his entire wardrobe is dal-
