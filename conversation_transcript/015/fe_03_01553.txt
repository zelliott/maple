0.60 1.93 B: hello 

1.66 2.81 A: hello 

2.96 7.53 B: (( hi ah my name is john what's yours )) 

6.70 7.97 A: (( ah gail )) 

8.06 15.45 B: oh hi okay topic of conversation ah did you catch that about the professional athletes striking 

15.54 17.27 A: yeah i heard about that 

17.95 23.15 B: i mean i didn't i didn't exactly catch exactly what the topic was as far as 

22.02 24.84 A: yes about them um striking 

26.14 27.42 A: they want to know what 

27.59 30.86 A: what our opinion is about them striking 

30.01 30.81 B: (( [cough] )) 

31.60 32.87 A: (( how people can )) 

31.70 34.53 B: my opi- my opinion on the the whole 

34.57 41.57 B: striking thing is i think they happen you know they're pretty pretty much overpaid but i do understand some of the reasons that they do it 

41.64 51.62 B: it's you know whether you would think that ah they could find another way you know to ah you know come to some sort of a compromise rather than striking 

50.50 51.79 A: yeah 

52.53 55.03 A: what is the reasons that they're striking though 

55.14 57.68 A: they want to get paid more or [laughter] 

57.53 70.77 B: i don't think it has as much to do with more money as ooh you know it's the power i think the you know there's always been a power struggle between the owners and the ah especially the unions 

70.16 71.24 A: team 

71.37 74.75 B: yeah the players unions depending on the sport 

74.81 83.96 B: um you know different sports i believe you know that they have different reasons behind you know what they're doing and i guess i have more um 

84.28 94.33 B: sympathy for some sports versus others baseball players i don't have a whole lot of sympathy for whatsoever because they don't there's 

88.40 89.35 A: right 

94.46 101.85 B: there's too much um inequities in the way the baseball players are are being paid as far as ah 

102.16 114.38 B: they don't have um what am i trying revenue sharing amongst the teams to even things out so that makes it pretty uncompetitive between the teams so you know that's one of the reasons i think baseball is dying 

114.58 115.67 A: (( all right )) 

116.79 121.21 A: well what about foot- is it football too is it mostly all the athletes 

121.33 130.71 B: well football they haven't had a strike in a while i don't think they are going to have a problem with it because football number one does have revenue sharing i think that's why you see parity in the league 

130.87 133.05 A: oh all right 

133.74 137.15 A: ah i say i was just looking it up on the web 

137.39 147.01 A: seeing what it says about them [laughter] but i guess i mean whenever there's a union you're going to i mean if you have a union and you have 

147.05 152.36 A: you know the heads and you have the union close to the unions there to back you up basically 

153.63 154.55 A: (( you know )) 

155.32 156.85 B: yeah well i mean that's 

156.86 158.54 B: that's the reason behind it but 

158.55 172.24 B: i mean before they had the baseball union per se the owners did have way too much power they did you know abuse the players back in the you know earlier part of the century up right through 

172.11 174.59 B: into the sixties when they had the first strike 

174.72 176.21 A: (( oh all right )) 

174.96 181.81 B: so i mean at that point i i wouldn't ah you know i didn't have a problem with them striking only in that ah 

181.95 189.81 B: you know i think they kind of needed to but that was also the point at which ah player salaries started to inflate tremendously 

184.04 185.05 A: yeah 

189.32 191.32 A: (( oh i see oh all right )) 

191.77 195.43 A: so basically it is the baseball players that are striking or 

195.90 197.38 B: well nobody is 

197.51 207.52 B: striking that i know of right now and honestly with the player strikes and everything i don't pay much attention to professional sports any more other than football 

207.54 212.42 B: i haven't been a basketball fan for eons 

212.44 221.81 B: ever since i was a youngster and baseball too although i still you know like the game like to play it it's kind of a boring game [laughter] 

212.92 213.81 A: uh-huh 

220.89 223.75 A: yeah yeah it is i know it 

224.10 225.48 A: yeah i know 

224.27 225.09 B: i mean 

225.86 238.28 B: i've i've become more of a soccer fan believe it or not for somebody i mean i'm like forty years old for somebody to pick up on soccer you know at an older age you know you'd expect somebody like me to be a baseball fan but 

229.46 230.75 A: (( all right )) 

238.10 243.13 B: the fact the players at this point they are not the big stars yet and i think they they work harder 

243.16 247.65 A: yeah all right i'm not too much into sports [noise] 

247.90 257.72 B: yeah i i was kind of getting the um the impression that this might not have been a real comfortable topic for you [laughter] 

254.83 264.14 A: yeah really i don't really know much about sports i mean i know like nascar and stuff like that [laughter] 

262.99 267.05 B: oh yeah where where are you from 

266.09 267.71 A: rhode island 

267.65 268.62 B: oh 

269.46 274.02 B: i wouldn't have i would not have picked that out i mean um 

274.44 278.51 B: especially nascar tends to be a southern type of thing too 

278.75 280.95 A: all right yeah i know it but 

281.10 284.24 A: i guess our family has always been into like nascar 

285.42 290.54 A: and my brother's like a big big fan and he collects cars and stuff for them 

291.60 294.86 A: you know dayline huh he just you know 

296.03 302.44 A: so i know more about that pretty much like the strike i don't really follow it 'cause i'm really not into sports 

302.75 311.94 B: no well i honestly i don't follow them either if they if they're on strike i'm not paying much attention i'm still at the point where i participate in a lot of sports so i don't really 

311.87 316.66 B: pay attention and watch what's on t._v. like i said football i'm a football fan i'm 

316.56 318.42 B: i'm in wisconsin here 

318.20 332.02 B: so if you live here you know you bleed green and gold everybody's a packer fan you don't have a chance [laughter] but other than that i'm just outside of milwaukee but as far as baseball goes i could care less if the brewers stay or go 

324.50 326.24 A: [laughter] right [mn] 

331.92 336.10 A: yeah exactly i know [laughter] all right 

334.78 335.77 B: (( you know and )) 

335.80 340.87 B: rhode island what kind of you know who what who do you follow in rhode island the new york teams 

340.33 341.99 A: oh no the patriots 

342.33 343.71 A: (( in football )) 

342.40 343.40 B: okay 

344.07 347.15 A: football yeah the patriots 

345.31 350.85 B: and then which is like for baseball would you be more following like boston or 

350.91 352.89 A: um honestly 

352.99 354.57 A: basically ah 

354.70 356.93 A: like yeah the boston um 

357.07 358.27 B: red sox 

357.79 361.33 A: yeah yeah that's who basically it would be 

362.01 364.54 A: yeah but 

363.45 364.58 B: okay 

364.80 367.25 A: i really don't follow it at all [laughter] 

366.88 370.72 B: no you've got to go by what you know the people you know follow 

370.91 373.18 A: yeah exactly i know it 

373.34 384.63 B: i mean in some areas especially on the east coast where a lot of the larger metropolitan areas are closer together you can have people in the same area following different teams and it's a big fight whereas here 

383.80 386.29 A: oh yeah it is yeah 

385.52 394.29 B: you know in wisconsin it's like you've got one team for every sport you know and that's it there's not really much to ah argue about 

394.08 403.55 B: you go down like my wife is actually from illinois so and baseball that's a big fight between the sox fans and the ah cubs fans 

403.56 406.53 B: so you know but up here there's not a whole lot 

404.41 405.68 A: (( mhm )) 

406.67 417.14 B: you know that's more or less you listen to a sports talk show and all year round it's football you know they do talk about how bad the brewers are or how good the bucks aren't but 

417.00 424.53 B: you know everything you know lives and dies by the packers around here although college sports yeah college sports are pretty good around here too 

420.61 421.87 A: all right 

424.83 435.22 B: um they do have a certain amount of following for ah college basketball with marquette and college hockey in wisconsin but and football of course again 

435.54 443.81 B: but now we are getting off topic but how long can you really talk about you know player strikes [laughter] 

435.65 436.69 A: (( uh-huh )) 

442.01 446.03 A: yeah i know it really i know really especially if you don't [laughter] 

444.35 449.83 B: i mean i can't even i'm a i'm fairly up on sports but i can't even remember the last time 

449.98 455.71 B: it was like two or three years ago that they talked about a possible lock out in ah 

455.75 458.85 B: baseball and in in my opinion 

458.87 469.79 B: baseball does need revenue sharing because that's the only way you're going to get a team like milwaukee or cincinnati or pittsburgh to be able to compete with a new york team that has all the money 

469.64 472.84 A: right yeah exactly definitely i hear you there 

473.18 476.31 A: that have a good cash flow [laughter] 

477.43 483.79 B: but as far as i'm concerned i mean baseball is just not it's not that exciting a sport you know they just built 

483.67 497.31 B: two years ago a brand new stadium here in milwaukee and it's as far as i'm concerned i'm a traditionalist and it's got that the the dome that opens and closes and that's been a that's been a fiasco here the thing all last year it leaked 

492.40 493.47 A: oh yeah 

497.75 499.22 A: oh my god 

499.05 501.78 B: yeah i mean so and they had 

501.79 508.91 B: ah really big you know big attendance last year because of the first year that they had you know miller park open so it was 

508.23 509.23 A: yeah 

509.03 517.19 B: but i went to one game and it just happened it was a cubs game because my wife wanted to go see the cubs i couldn't careless about it actually seeing the brewers and i didn't like 

517.16 525.76 B: and i used to go to a couple of games every year and i didn't even like going there because it seemed like you were in a big garage it's just not baseball 

525.61 528.92 A: (( all right [noise] it's commercialized )) 

528.95 539.73 B: yeah well i mean i grew up going my dad played baseball we had a lot of baseball leagues in the area in the summer time my dad was a big baseball player i played baseball and i grew up with it out and it was 

539.63 550.07 B: you know kind of a community thing everybody went out to the ball game on sundays and you know there wasn't as much other things to do and that was that was really neat but now 

549.83 563.15 B: you know there's so many other sports and i guess it's soccer has taken off here i don't know if soccer's big on the east coast i know ah um new england has a big ah m._l._s. team 

561.94 564.11 A: mhm well 

565.36 568.05 B: you're probably not real familiar with them either huh 

567.99 569.74 A: (( no no )) 

568.99 574.06 B: [laughter] 

570.01 572.50 A: [laughter] could you [laughter] 

573.40 578.76 A: yeah i don't like i said i don't follow sports like pretty much 

579.86 580.68 A: (( mm )) 

581.65 584.58 B: well what but you do follow nascar huh 

584.54 591.76 A: mhm yeah we follow that like dayline hot junior and his father just passed like two years ago 

595.60 596.69 A: and um you
