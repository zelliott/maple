0.50 1.59 B: hello 

1.11 3.52 A: hello this is trish in boston 

3.21 5.39 B: hi this is jacqui from virginia 

5.03 6.64 A: hi jacqui how are you 

6.29 7.60 B: fine how you doing 

7.03 8.33 A: good thank you 

7.95 14.35 B: good um what do you think about you know tightened security preventing terrorists 

14.54 23.27 A: well i think they've definitely um stepped it up a bit but i still think that there's room for improvement at the airports especially um 

20.26 21.23 B: right 

23.35 27.55 A: i've been there sometimes when they don't really seem to be paying attention 

27.62 28.75 A: um 

29.50 33.90 A: and i still think that there are ways that people can get things on board 

33.71 45.57 B: right yeah i i i would have to agree with you i haven't been i haven't traveled since wait a minute let me see have i yeah i've been to been on a plane since all this stuff [noise] happened last i mean uh 

44.98 46.39 A: since september eleven 

45.67 47.29 B: yeah [noise] september eleven 

47.37 48.55 B: but um 

49.47 51.97 B: i don't know i still think that you know if 

52.99 57.92 B: there are ways that some- someone could get like a a weapon or something 

58.04 61.37 B: on a plane without them really knowing about it 

61.01 69.54 A: yes and it's and it's since and it has happened since but i mean definitely is um i think more secure than it was in the past 

63.33 64.65 B: yeah 

68.92 71.02 B: yeah i'd i would have to agree 

70.26 73.70 A: but if you travel now you need to uh not wear boots 

74.02 76.41 A: because if you wear boots you have to take them off 

76.03 77.56 B: oh okay 

77.21 82.75 A: can't wear a coat i mean you have to take off your coat it's a little bit of an inconvenience 

82.18 83.61 B: mhm 

82.86 86.83 A: um which i guess they're working on making it simpler but 

85.98 92.76 B: yeah i'm not sure i haven't been through a lot of different airports just um 

92.08 93.62 A: you live in virginia 

93.33 94.22 B: uh-huh 

93.81 95.62 A: (( so d- where do you travel from )) 

95.69 96.91 B: um 

97.27 99.38 B: well i've been to dallas 

98.94 100.02 A: mhm 

99.47 103.03 B: um since all this happened and where else have i been 

103.25 106.11 B: to uh i haven't been out of the country or anything 

106.13 107.43 A: no me either 

107.32 108.70 B: so um 

109.56 113.50 B: that's about it i i believe i think it's it's pretty 

113.79 114.72 B: i mean 

115.50 119.14 B: i think it's it's great that they won't let you go 

119.18 127.29 B: um past the the gate you know if someone's getting off the plane that you know you can't you know really get back to um 

123.90 125.00 A: right 

127.58 129.45 B: where they're boarding and everything 

129.55 131.83 B: i think that's pretty good but um 

131.12 139.55 A: that you can only get um to the gate if you're a ticketed passenger and there's not as many people around which is good and stuff but for some of the 

134.80 135.97 B: right 

137.66 138.70 B: yeah 

140.21 141.22 A: um 

142.07 143.18 A: the uh 

143.99 152.66 A: equipment that they need to be able to scan luggage and stuff that it hasn't happened in all the airports yet and that's gonna take a long time and cost a lot of money but i 

149.58 150.52 B: right 

151.97 153.77 B: mhm i think so too 

153.46 161.64 A: but i think for people getting through you know they definitely have beefed up security and there's a lot more people there and in new york they still have um 

161.85 163.44 A: the national guard 

163.58 164.63 B: oh they do 

164.12 175.55 A: mhm when you fly into um la guardia they do they don't have it in i fly in and out of boston and they don't have it here now do you fly out of um washington airports or do you go to virginia 

164.70 165.78 B: (( oh okay )) 

170.29 171.24 B: okay 

174.88 178.15 B: no i go to virginia either um let me see 

178.69 182.16 B: either richmond sometimes i fly out of um 

182.26 183.49 B: (( norfolk you )) 

183.08 184.24 A: mhm 

183.70 185.59 B: know it just all depends 

185.23 186.91 A: is that a smaller airport 

186.62 190.44 B: norfolk is larger actually mhm richmond is is 

187.76 188.88 A: is it large 

190.71 192.13 B: pretty small 

192.44 196.04 B: um compared to the other airports i've been to 

195.54 196.50 A: mhm 

196.23 197.02 B: so 

197.18 202.01 B: i mean it it's not bad at all but i just think that sometimes um 

202.18 205.85 B: the employees aren't really paying as much attention 

205.46 206.52 A: correct 

205.97 209.70 B: to [laughter] to detail as as they should be 

207.02 208.05 A: [laughter] 

209.61 217.60 A: i know i recently went to um check in at delta and they didn't even ask me for my identity 

217.58 219.01 B: but you're kidding 

218.26 221.44 A: but that was at the ticket counter but of course 

220.49 222.51 B: but still yeah i mean 

221.71 223.84 A: they do and they um 

224.20 229.37 A: and then you have to use it of course to get through the uh gate i mean through the 

230.74 237.46 A: where they x-ray your bags and and stuff you have to have your boarding pass and your um license 

232.51 233.45 B: right 

237.12 239.40 B: mm i heard on the um 

239.57 244.71 B: television tonight that uh pilots are gonna be um 

245.03 246.62 A: carrying guns 

245.13 247.60 B: are gon- carrying guns yeah 

246.70 250.80 A: but you won't know which they they're not going to announce 

250.24 252.06 B: right [laughter] 

250.81 258.43 A: [laughter] this pilot this flight the pilot has a gun yeah i kn- just the other day i saw on the on the news that um 

252.59 254.31 B: [laughter] 

259.14 268.56 A: there was an american airlines flight from long beach california which is where i used to live on its way to new york that had to be diverted in phoenix because two people on um 

263.43 264.22 B: (( mm )) 

269.03 272.02 A: the plane thought that another passenger had a knife 

272.07 274.67 B: oh really oh gosh 

272.95 274.04 A: mhm 

274.99 281.57 A: but they didn't so once they'd determined that they didn't them were able to uh get back in the air and stuff so 

281.16 282.10 B: okay 

282.45 283.18 B: (( mm )) 

282.65 287.89 A: so that's still ha- i mean people are still cautious and looking at um 

285.64 286.61 B: right 

287.98 290.07 A: their fellow passengers 

289.44 290.39 B: right 

290.21 291.60 A: i haven't flown 

291.73 294.03 A: extensively since nine eleven 

293.72 298.98 B: yeah i haven't either but i'm not afraid though you know no not either 

296.70 301.99 A: no i'm not either i'm just afraid of in a flight you know just the general things that can go wrong when you fly 

301.68 303.45 B: yeah i just hope that 

303.49 307.95 B: you know they look at everybody across the board you know and not just 

308.37 309.71 B: you know um 

309.84 311.16 B: target 

311.38 314.65 B: certain people that they think are just you know 

312.21 313.31 A: correct 

314.88 315.81 B: um 

316.61 320.05 B: suspicious you know just because of the way you look or something 

317.34 318.53 A: mhm 

319.65 322.93 A: right well for a while when i was flying i um 

320.06 321.10 B: (( but it's just )) 

323.07 326.54 A: w- would get targeted because i um 

327.11 328.74 A: bought a one-way ticket 

328.43 329.46 B: mhm 

328.89 339.38 A: at the last minute and i think that's that's something that they look out for and what else did i do there was one other thing that i did and someone said oh that's probably why 

330.09 331.01 B: okay 

339.63 340.69 B: oh 

339.82 341.35 A: they called you out 

341.28 343.36 B: yeah 

342.34 347.50 A: and i've seen them call out all different types of people here on the east coast 

347.12 348.16 B: okay 

347.73 352.33 A: older people much older people um pregnant women 

352.31 353.46 B: really 

352.73 354.21 A: yep [laughter] 

354.06 355.54 B: oh my goodness 

355.50 362.22 A: so well that's a part of it is because a lot of the people flying back and forth on the shuttle are all the same it's pretty much upper 

362.41 363.90 A: you know its middle class 

363.60 364.52 B: okay 

364.05 365.23 A: white people 

365.26 366.12 B: okay 

365.45 367.44 A: [laughter] 

367.08 370.18 B: [laughter] yeah 

368.33 369.25 A: so 

369.57 372.09 A: they have to figure you know pick somebody 

371.78 372.92 B: right [laughter] 

372.76 373.64 A: [laughter] 

373.88 377.68 B: oh man but um o- overall i think you know 

378.17 380.76 B: i think they've they've improved but 

381.76 383.36 B: i don't i don't know i think 

382.40 384.08 A: well they don't let you park 

384.33 388.64 A: you know there's more security around the airport you can't leave your car 

388.48 393.95 B: oh right yeah i mean that's why i mean like my husband travels a little bit more than i do 

393.63 394.77 A: mhm 

394.20 400.96 B: and i always tell him to you know let me know exactly when his plane is gonna arrive 

401.04 411.00 B: and um you know if there's any change to call me and let me know because it's like a forty it's about a half an hour drive from my home to the airport 

410.68 412.33 A: oh do you go and pick him up 

411.78 413.85 B: yeah and i go pick him up sometimes 

413.95 420.15 B: and if i do i have to like you know just circle the block you know because i can't park you know 

417.65 419.04 A: mhm 

420.17 422.48 B: just to pick him up you know so 

422.53 427.70 B: i mean that's just a hassle but i mean it's you know it's it's needed but 

427.15 428.42 A: it is needed 

427.73 428.97 B: (( it's just uh oh )) 

428.71 431.40 A: but it is it is it is very difficult 

428.99 430.39 B: (( my god )) 

430.98 432.44 B: yeah 

432.28 436.24 A: we usually um here in boston we have the subway the t. 

436.05 436.98 B: okay 

436.49 438.91 A: so that's how i usually get home 

438.68 439.70 B: yeah 

439.07 440.24 A: jump on the 

440.51 444.64 A: shuttle and just on the shuttle bus and then get on the t 

444.42 448.52 B: okay yeah i i like boston i haven't been there in a long time 

447.46 449.01 A: tomorrow's the marathon 

449.44 450.25 B: (( hm )) 

449.96 451.89 A: tomorrow's the boston marathon 

451.58 452.50 B: (( it is )) 

452.01 453.23 A: mhm 

452.61 453.79 B: (( oh okay )) 

453.37 455.21 A: so the city's very crowded 

455.15 456.47 B: wow 

455.84 457.32 A: but it is nice 

457.29 460.53 B: yeah i haven't been to boston in years 

459.75 461.82 A: oh okay um 

462.66 463.84 B: but um 

463.46 467.54 A: so i i think they're definitely it's definitely been an improvement i think there is 

467.99 469.50 A: there is more to do 

469.79 472.47 B: right i think so as well 

472.29 474.44 A: i think the people um 

475.01 477.07 A: the cost 

477.77 482.30 A: uh it's expensive but it's necessary to spend the money 

481.99 486.03 B: yeah i think so too i just hope that um 

486.21 494.83 B: with all of the you know if they improve the technology to you know to scan i guess um baggage and everything 

494.86 500.17 B: that they just stay on top of you know training the employees you know because 

499.89 502.31 A: right and being able to do it um 

501.55 503.88 B: right if they've got to spend all the money 

504.06 509.13 A: ex- yeah being able to do that and also to be able to do it in in as quick a way as possible 

504.55 505.45 B: (( you know )) 

508.70 509.66 B: right 

509.51 522.43 A: because i think that um you know it's hard enough with different things that can go wrong and weather and planes being late and the airport's getting very crowded and so if it takes a long time to screen all the bags 

518.95 520.01 B: right 

522.77 525.18 A: then that will lead to more frustration 

524.99 530.96 B: it sh- yeah i agr- i agree definitely but there's one where was there was one airline i wa- 

531.05 534.48 B: gonna say i was watching television i don't whether it was it wasn't 

534.70 535.63 B: (( mm )) 

536.67 541.78 B: uh i thought they were they weren't on strike but something that happened 

541.83 543.42 A: um recently 

542.89 544.51 B: yeah um 

543.88 546.88 A: american airlines um 

547.59 550.33 A: was having some financial trouble and so was 

550.41 551.32 B: okay 

550.96 552.14 A: united 

552.10 554.97 B: okay maybe it was it may have been united 

554.00 556.30 A: i don't think anybody's been on strike 

555.68 557.62 B: no i think they were um 

557.86 559.97 A: they were threatening to go on strike 

559.39 560.36 B: okay 

560.66 563.87 B: 'cause i i heard a spokesperson come on for um 

563.97 568.44 B: one of the one of the airlines but i think they're doing a lot better 

568.47 569.55 B: hopefully 

570.09 571.20 B: (( but um )) 

572.36 574.95 B: (( uh i don't know i think um )) 

576.06 578.58 B: you know i definitely think it's gonna get a lot better 

578.79 579.93 B: as time 

580.29 581.63 B: you know moves on 

581.21 583.17 A: mhm i think so too 

583.54 584.59 B: (( so yeah )) 

583.97 586.58 A: we'll hope we'll keep our fingers crossed 

585.98 588.66 B: yeah i know um i hope they uh 

588.74 593.73 B: you know with the pilots you know being armed and all hopefully that won't pre- 

593.87 598.39 B: present any challenges i'm pretty sure like you said they won't announce it or anything 

597.75 599.89 A: no and it won't be um
