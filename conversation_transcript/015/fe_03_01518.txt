18.91 19.88 A: hi 

20.94 21.99 B: (( i'm )) 

22.20 24.56 B: angela and what's your name again 

24.33 25.28 A: joan 

25.48 26.52 B: (( joel )) 

25.64 27.09 A: j. o. a. n. 

27.60 29.50 B: j. o. a. n. okay 

28.95 30.01 A: mhm 

29.67 31.15 B: hi how you doing 

30.97 32.33 A: good how about you 

31.78 34.35 B: [sigh] just fine um 

35.04 38.23 B: di- so we're supposed to discuss the topic of um 

38.85 40.56 A: recent actors 

39.12 40.22 B: athletes 

40.78 42.75 B: athlete's salaries 

43.78 44.65 A: yes 

44.66 49.99 A: well the strikes and if we think they deserve the s- the high salaries they make 

44.81 45.71 B: okay 

50.69 53.94 B: okay okay would you like to go first or 

53.95 54.87 A: sure 

54.96 56.09 B: okay 

55.83 66.22 A: [laughter] i think they do deserve it because obviously people are willing to pay the price for the tickets to get in there so why shouldn't they make that kind of money 

67.11 69.37 B: that's right i agree with you on that 

69.53 73.28 B: yes i um i totally i agree i agree 

72.81 73.61 A: [noise] 

73.75 76.61 B: because um i think they should make it also 

77.08 84.01 B: i think they work hard you know they work hard for what um they work hard to be where they are 

77.36 78.09 A: oh 

78.87 80.37 A: (( yes [noise] [noise] )) 

84.20 94.96 B: and that that goes for anything that you work hard at and you make it to that point you deserve what you strive for and that's what they strive for 

95.02 98.68 B: and i feel that they should um make what they um 

98.52 112.27 A: well the training is very uh extensive and i think tough training and plus i mean one injury [noise] can total ruin their career so then they're done and and you know that that's that 

98.93 100.03 B: what they give 

113.17 114.62 B: (( right )) 

115.15 126.22 A: i mean if they're a football player and something major goes wrong with a hip or a leg or whatever they're just done with their career and have to move on so these careers can be fairly short lived [noise] 

115.39 116.34 B: yes 

126.68 128.72 B: that's true yes 

129.74 133.91 B: yes i feel that um that that i strongly agree with that yes 'cause 

133.97 141.01 B: once they're um they they do make those um the salaries that they do make you know if they were to be injured 

141.87 153.87 B: their career would be gone but then they would have something to fall back on in order to get up and start over they would have uh an opportunity to start over and not just to be um 

154.72 155.93 B: a failure 

156.10 165.01 B: you know failed at that industry the sports industry they would have opportunity to do other things in the sports industry other than just play a sport 

164.48 165.53 A: right 

165.26 166.91 B: and and to be 

167.12 170.29 B: financially you know well off or 

170.37 181.86 B: in the same position that they were in once before they wouldn't have to change their lifestyle you know their lifestyle will continue to um to be the same or continue to grow however they you know they would like for it to be 

173.66 174.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

182.02 183.65 B: they will still be comfortable 

182.48 187.83 A: i would also guess that many of 'em haven't really uh forward in their 

188.13 194.66 A: their uh education because a lot of 'em leave college or whatever if they're good enough to play 

194.67 209.65 A: whatever sport it is they don't finish college or whatever so a lot of 'em are really left high and dry should their career end you know they're gonna have to start from scratch again if they wanna do anything other than a sports 

210.71 211.73 B: right 

211.49 213.27 A: job um 

213.26 221.32 B: yeah or or else they could just um go back go back and pick up from where they left off as far as educational wise 

219.20 220.31 A: right 

221.38 224.19 B: yeah they will have opportunity to do that 

224.43 227.84 B: and uh and to move forward from that you know 

228.13 236.24 A: i think it's also a lot of the the especially the hard sports like football i think that their health is [noise] 

236.12 244.13 A: deteriorates faster than an average person who works in an office too i think that their aging process is a little speedier 

244.24 246.08 A: because the you know the 

246.45 249.03 A: force and whatever that they're using 

249.23 250.37 B: right 

250.73 254.51 B: yeah because yeah 'cause they're taking so many heavy blows in foot- uh 

254.59 265.56 B: in football the same as they uh normally take in you know any other sports too like boxing and baseball you know well baseball's really not a 

265.85 271.31 B: uh a strenuous sport or a heavy sport because you know they're not getting hit 

271.89 283.95 B: but i know that sometimes swinging that bat you know it can hurt you if you don't you know if you don't stay up to standards sort of staying in shape [laughter] you know yeah but um 

280.71 282.24 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

283.98 287.82 B: yes sports they do take they will take heavier blows in 

288.15 292.37 B: in football and in boxing and um 

292.90 295.26 B: wrestling you know karate 

295.27 297.84 B: karate sports and all that also [noise] 

298.00 309.66 A: and another thing a lot of the um professional sports i think that it's uh um hard family life too you almost need like two homes because like baseball 

309.80 319.36 A: they come to florida for spring training and you know they're wherever their actual home is and then they're also all over the country playing these games and [noise] it's like that's 

319.40 321.59 A: a pretty tough family life 

322.00 323.64 B: mhm yes yes 

323.00 330.10 A: so you know something needs to compensate for that so i guess the pay is about the only [laughter] thing that can 

330.26 335.36 B: right right and yeah that's that's a good that's a good way to yes 

335.80 340.40 B: that's a good statement because um yeah they would have to you know 

340.62 342.30 B: two different homes 

342.59 348.08 B: you know 'cause 'cause if they have children and they have families they can't just pick up and keep moving 

348.07 351.56 A: well i saw one of those um those uh 

348.21 349.68 B: every time you know 

352.00 358.49 A: race car drivers they have like a mobile home on wheels that they take from track to track with them 

357.82 362.15 B: (( [noise] yes they do don't they yeah they usually have winnebago )) 

360.95 361.81 A: you know 

362.23 372.54 A: yeah that's so that's the only way they can really maintain a real family life is to take their family on the road with them and that's quite the expense there too 

373.06 377.19 B: right that's true yes and then having to hire um 

377.22 381.12 B: to hire people to be with their family you know such as um 

379.41 380.55 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

381.30 385.70 B: instructors home schooling you know they have to um 

385.91 391.75 B: they have to be compensated for all of that because they have they seem to have more expenses than a normal um 

391.78 399.09 B: blue collar worker [laughter] they would have they would have more expenses than they would so yes i agree with you on that you know 

393.74 394.90 A: yes [laughter] 

399.21 412.77 A: the other thing it really all boils down to the sports fans are willing to pay the price [noise] you know no matter how much the tickets go to the the stadiums are full so obviously the public accepts it 

399.61 400.56 B: (( on that )) 

409.73 410.77 B: uh-huh 

412.99 414.22 B: yes 

417.21 421.91 A: now i'm running out of things to think about [laughter] 

417.54 418.35 B: 'cause 

419.64 420.59 B: mhm 

421.10 423.94 B: (( well i can think of something okay )) 

423.96 425.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

424.57 426.68 B: yes i think you know 

427.02 430.12 B: if the sports fans you know do 

432.99 433.80 B: (( like )) 

435.47 436.07 B: (( um )) 

439.03 440.53 B: and and any 

439.22 440.83 A: i'm just not 

440.68 454.41 A: i'm just not a big sports fan and so it's hard for me to like when i think about eighty dollars or three hundred dollars for a ticket it seems outrageous to me but on the other hand if it was something i liked it probably wouldn't 

441.02 442.29 B: price 

455.82 457.25 B: (( well no i love )) 

458.22 466.86 B: if i had to pay a three hundred dollar ticket just to sit at the front or sit close or whatever to see all the action i would lov- i would i would 

467.97 468.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

476.09 484.84 A: both my daughters are sports fans so i that's why i say i can understand it you know that they would pay it and if they would pay it why shouldn't they get it 

476.80 477.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

486.79 490.79 B: 'cause i you know i love it you know i love i support all 

494.22 498.72 A: and maybe one day if we have a football playing grandson 

498.87 499.63 A: so 

499.98 503.60 A: maybe i'll really support [laughter] them making big money 

503.78 505.61 B: yes yes 

508.57 510.24 B: uh the sports industry 

510.48 511.75 B: (( and um )) 

512.64 516.64 B: i um i hope you know even if they do strike 

516.78 521.89 B: with you know they continue to um make their salaries their salary don't be cut 

524.12 526.41 B: still being televised over um 

526.67 527.81 B: satellite 

527.74 528.80 A: right 

527.83 536.38 B: and and even you know a lot of times even if you can't go out to the stadium you gonna tune into it you know by television 

536.45 544.66 B: so there's not it's or by radio when you're driving 'cause i listen to it everywhere i go if there's an team playing and you know like 

545.30 548.90 B: the and they're broadcasting it wherever i am i'm gonna turn in to it 

549.04 553.90 B: so um i you know i applaud them you know and whatever they do 

552.94 558.28 A: well all those people when you say that all those people make money off this too 

558.22 565.97 B: exactly everyone makes money off of it and a portion goes back to the the athlete themselves you know and that's how they're getting paid 

566.46 573.34 A: because the t._v. stations make money the radio stations make money all the vendors you know that sell the 

569.81 571.01 B: (( precisely )) 

571.92 575.26 B: right they get it they get it through advertising right 

575.44 584.60 A: so it's more than them that gets hurt by the strike though that that's the sad part you know when they go on strike it hurts everybody around them but 

584.89 586.48 B: right yeah 

585.08 585.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

586.53 594.65 B: well i feel if they do go on strike they still should um continue to be compensated for what they they have been doing 

594.80 598.89 B: the same as if we were to get laid off from our job 

598.54 599.85 A: right 

599.38 599.89 B: is
