0.46 1.76 B: hello 

0.60 1.65 A: hello 

1.80 4.71 B: my name is dee i'm from atlanta 

5.19 8.04 A: my name's anne i'm from michigan 

8.04 9.05 B: okay 

9.25 13.93 B: um what are your thoughts anne on the airport security these days 

14.50 21.87 A: ah i haven't really flown since the september thing but i don't i don't know i think it's good to 

20.26 21.76 B: why is that 

21.77 24.31 B: have you purposely been avoiding flying 

24.02 27.00 A: oh no i just haven't needed to fly 

26.77 27.92 B: mhm 

27.58 29.48 A: i don't travel that much 

29.23 30.22 B: yeah 

29.92 30.94 A: but 

30.95 39.41 A: i don't i think it's good to raise security i don't know how intense it's been though so i'm not sure if they're overdoing it or not 

39.92 41.03 B: yeah 

41.07 45.99 B: i think that um it was long overdue that we should have done it long time ago 

46.55 58.05 B: you know um most other countries even third world [laughter] you know have been putting forth some type of effort to deter terrorism and we didn't 

48.54 49.10 A: (( [cough] )) 

57.91 66.96 B: you know it wasn't a part of our vocabulary at the time well it was but we just didn't recognize it we didn't do anything and i think it's very much needed 

63.42 64.31 A: mhm 

67.63 76.14 A: yeah i think ah i think that we really do need to raise security for a lot of things including airports in particular because that's a big 

75.03 76.12 B: exactly 

76.19 78.02 A: area where they could get through 

78.82 84.89 A: i don't know how how real intense is the security now is it enough do you think 

85.59 91.94 B: um you know to me that's a real thin line because you know who is to say what's enough 

91.77 92.68 A: mhm 

91.98 101.58 B: as it stand now you have to be there you know a couple of hours ahead of time 'cause you don't know how long the line is going to be you know what i'm saying 

101.10 102.08 A: yeah 

101.65 108.03 B: but the thing is um to me that's a real fine line there who knows how far to go 

108.46 120.05 B: you know to me it's better than it was because we didn't have anything before we was just sitting out there and anybody who even thought they wanted to do anything they had no problem succeeding at it 

119.96 121.24 A: yeah 

120.60 130.84 B: so you know now we are putting forth some effort and um to me we should always continue that i mean to me this is the new way you fly now 

130.87 131.78 A: mhm 

131.15 137.45 B: and i think that is the way it's going be too because you know they changed the doors on the cockpit 

137.11 137.96 A: (( yes )) 

137.28 151.21 B: to um make 'em reinforced and i saw on the news the other day that today would be the first day that they graduated a class of pilots that have permission and have been given lessons on how to use a gun 

151.20 152.46 A: that's good mm 

152.08 153.04 B: yeah 

153.21 159.56 B: they are not making the pilots take the class but um you know it's a voluntary thing 

159.60 164.40 B: the class was full and they're going to start another one at the end at the beginning of the summer i think 

164.65 170.83 B: so yeah i think they need some type of protection for themselves because who knows there are so many crazies running around 

170.91 173.22 A: have you flown since then 

171.15 172.03 B: [laughter] 

172.97 175.13 B: yeah several times 

174.93 176.13 A: so is it 

176.29 182.01 A: is it like more of a hassle than it used to be or it's clearly more of 

180.93 194.33 B: well to me it depends on the way you look at it and the way i look at it if i see people more people around um i see you being really cautious about what's in my bags to me that makes me feel safe 

182.04 182.83 A: (( a )) 

194.17 195.04 A: mhm 

194.44 196.08 B: it is a pain 

196.09 197.96 B: 'cause it's time consuming 

197.78 198.66 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

198.24 210.08 B: but instead of standing there you know with your mouth stuck out about it and you know mumbling in in a bad mood you know just adjust to it this is the way of life 

210.56 216.31 B: at this point to me this is the way of life um it's not ever going to go back to being the same 

216.91 221.31 B: i hope not [laughter] look what happened when we were so lax 

221.45 233.26 B: but you know they um they're not dummies they saw us sitting out in the opening with no protection plan or whatever for terrorism go because they i guess we thought we were too big for it 

233.41 238.88 B: so someone else will try again they'll just find a way to go around all the loopholes [laughter] 

238.99 242.44 A: yeah there's plenty of ways they could get at us 

239.61 240.65 B: you know 

241.85 243.18 B: oh yeah 

242.97 246.14 A: and i i understand why they wanted to i mean well 

243.20 244.26 B: for sure 

246.76 251.85 A: we're just they don't have what we have and we pretty much aren't giving it to them 

252.07 253.09 B: true 

252.28 258.14 A: we're not offering like we have enough food to feed the world and yet there's people starving all over the place 

258.02 259.06 B: yeah 

258.56 266.31 A: because we're just so focussed on money and possessions that we're not really doing anything to try to 

267.10 270.79 A: give it to go to them too so that they're not suffering 

269.11 270.12 B: yeah 

271.05 272.11 B: yeah 

272.43 282.20 B: um and people have different reasons for wanting to hurt you know the states you know some of it runs deep and some of it is just their way of thinking 

277.40 278.13 A: (( mm )) 

282.19 292.84 B: but in my opinion our government should have long time ago had the foresight to see that and protected us and maybe would not have 

292.98 298.34 B: caused i mean maybe unfair is the wrong way maybe it would not have 

298.23 306.65 B: made the accident you know nine eleven happen but the thing is it wasn't an accident it was intention but [laughter] the thing is 

306.49 315.80 B: it wouldn't have been so easily done maybe wouldn't have been so well organized you understand what i'm saying if they had been been met with more opposition 

315.57 316.46 A: (( yeah )) 

316.27 320.31 B: because it was just a coup for them in my opinion [laughter] 

319.27 321.92 A: it was yeah it was real easy for them 

321.58 323.95 B: yeah i think so 

323.52 327.27 A: they could have pulled that type of stuff all the time and we wouldn't have 

327.07 328.75 B: (( mhm )) 

327.87 329.49 A: have anything to stop 'em 

329.31 332.09 B: exactly exactly 

330.04 330.91 A: (( [cough] mhm [laughter] )) 

332.35 340.64 B: so um i think that they will try again i'm glad that they did the reinforced door and the guns on the pilots 

340.92 348.07 B: you know i think that's good and um you know all the people around checking everything it's wonderful 

348.11 360.62 B: but you know you tend to forget [laughter] you tend to forget i went to detroit um a few weeks ago and i had i i was bringing home a bottle of liquor 

360.59 370.56 B: for a friend but then some friends came over and we ended up opening it you know i'm doing it for somebody else but you used to do that because it's cheaper up there 

370.44 376.87 B: so i buy this uh fifth of remy martin and then friends came over and we drink they drink out of it i don't drink that 

376.76 381.21 B: and um i put the rest of it in my bag to bring home to my girlfriend 

381.01 393.77 B: and um they take it at the airport [laughter] i thought that was so funny in i don't ah i don't know how come detroit didn't catch it but they caught it here 

394.13 404.11 B: and they took it out and they had a note in my bag telling me that it was against you know their policy for me to bring in unopened alcoholic beverages 

404.98 414.10 B: so and i've done that a thousand times [laughter] so yeah they're on their job atlanta hartsfield caught it so 

408.74 409.57 A: so 

413.85 414.69 A: that's 

415.09 418.28 A: yeah i think they really do need to be a lot more aware 

418.38 420.16 B: yeah i do too 

420.45 426.21 B: and it will make you feel safer even if it's a [laughter] not a really true 

426.56 432.26 B: security thing you know they're never going to be able to prevent someone from doing anything that they really want to do 

432.18 433.18 A: mhm 

432.54 441.88 B: but to me they have put forth an effort and um i think it's good enough but you know in all honesty i believe they're going to take it as far as they can 

441.65 442.58 A: mhm 

441.91 446.99 B: i can see us waiting three hours four hours for a flight 

448.06 449.54 B: i can see that 

449.41 450.32 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

450.46 462.20 B: i can what i wish they would do though is um and it wouldn't it wouldn't be very much use in doing it if you don't fly that often but if you fly often if they have like um 

462.24 473.53 B: frequent fliers something that preregister you you know what i'm saying that can be the background check and everything and then we need a h._o._v. lane at the airport is [laughter] what i'm saying 

467.10 467.81 A: (( yes mm )) 

474.03 480.23 B: you know we need a fast lane that you can go in and everything has been done by computer or whatever and you just 

480.08 493.74 B: not have to wait as long you still have to be checked out your suitcases have to be xrayed and everything but i'm saying you won't have to wait for the initial counter you know to purchase your ticket because you'll have it in hand already 

494.18 507.91 B: so hopefully they'll be able to do something like that to minimize the wait time because the mood in the line [laughter] is ugly people are pissed about having to wait you know they're just huffing and 

507.03 509.96 A: yeah they're all everybody's in a hurry nowadays 

509.83 518.71 B: i i know but i mean to me just blow it off don't let it ruin your trip and you know just go with it you don't have a choice 

515.58 516.48 A: mhm 

518.06 520.84 A: it's better to be safe than blown up [laughter] 

520.36 534.12 B: i totally [laughter] i totally agree but you know what i don't understand is why would you stand there and complain you saw what happened you know what i'm saying when there was no concern 

531.01 531.94 A: yeah 

534.12 540.73 B: so why would you stand there complain when they are taking concern at this point what do you want them to do 

541.06 552.80 B: you know what i'm saying to me they should have had foresight to see this beforehand but they didn't so once something happened they took precautions and you want to stand there and huff your nose at them come on 

542.14 542.80 A: (( yes )) 

552.45 567.24 A: some people just think they're untouchable like oh it wouldn't happen to me and they get irritated when their lives are messed up because of it they just can't accept that you know this is what life is coming to we need to be cautious or else we could get blown up 

559.28 560.36 B: true 

567.05 575.36 B: exactly and how short or half minded do you have to be to know that they're doing it for your protection 

576.12 587.78 B: and it didn't come cheap [laughter] you know they are still training people and they have to change their protocol and you know their hierarchy system the way it was set up and everything 

578.39 579.11 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

587.73 592.14 B: so it didn't come cheap but it was something that had to be accomplished 

592.57 594.46 B: (( so you know )) 

595.70 599.89 B: i don't have a problem with it um to me if it gets real r-
