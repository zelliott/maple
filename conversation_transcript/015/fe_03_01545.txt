13.71 17.44 A: yeah i know i have a brother in law in in uh reilly 

15.60 22.06 B: oh well what our topic is the salaries that sports figures makes 

20.98 26.64 A: yeah the strikes well how do you feel about the strikes and i think they already make too much money 

26.25 33.19 B: oh definitely oh the strikes like when the baseball players went on strike for more money 

27.58 28.43 A: [laughter] 

30.55 31.75 A: (( yep )) 

32.47 35.90 A: yeah i think they make way too much money 

35.56 44.36 B: well and i don't even know that all started how every many years ago whoever started making 'cause they didn't use to make that much money years ago 

43.28 44.53 A: i know 

44.38 47.76 B: and i i think they had strikes back then too but 

47.30 52.34 A: yeah 'cause plus what they make and then plus all those endorsements and stuff they get 

47.78 48.44 B: i 

51.74 55.10 B: well see that's just it it doesn't stop with the salary 

54.41 57.41 A: yeah they get they like yeah 

55.23 56.35 B: i mean 

56.52 61.66 B: i think my husband told me that michael jordan made more money through nike 

61.62 74.62 B: and um the hot dog company [laughter] the arcromyer and uh underwear company hanes and uh but you know who makes more than he does even with endorsements is tiger woods 

64.33 65.43 A: yeah 

68.18 70.06 A: yeah [laughter] 

74.44 76.26 A: oh yes that's true 

75.14 79.21 B: he makes more in endorsements than michael jordan did 

78.41 84.84 A: that's true and i you know and i'm thinking about the you know i'm always thinking about all the people that are homeless and 

84.33 85.56 B: i know 

84.96 86.68 A: stuff like that you know 

86.26 96.34 B: the only comfort i get is that i really like to think that these guys that make these millions of dollars do give a lot of it away to charity 

96.40 101.48 B: i don't think we hear about all the charities they give too but i've in my mind 

100.21 106.46 A: yeah some of 'em some of 'em are real nice and do you know and they do do that but i don't know 

103.41 104.56 B: yeah 

105.21 113.90 B: and we hear about it but i'm hoping that a lot of 'em do anyway and we just don't know about it 'cause otherwise it makes no sense 

113.85 116.67 A: well i don't know because i have just like uh 

117.06 121.14 A: you know being a minority and all that and michael michael jordan and 

121.20 125.43 A: he with having those shoes for two hundreds at one time [laughter] 

125.26 126.49 B: oh yeah 

125.60 130.98 A: and all the little peop- you know all the little kids wanted these michael jordan tennis shoes 

130.38 131.57 B: i know 

131.07 132.89 A: and they were you know 

132.74 135.70 B: i know i bought 'em myself for my boy 

135.06 142.48 A: yeah and you know they were living have a fit and you knows you know all those little kids are getting out of you know they can't afford 

136.22 138.29 B: a hundred and some dollars 

141.13 146.49 B: but i don't really think that's really michael jordan's fault i think that's nike's fault they're the ones that probably 

145.20 157.39 A: yeah but can they have a can he have a say so like i'm not 'cause like shaquille o'neil he remember do you remember shaquille o'neil he would not endorse the shoes they were gonna cost so you know 

148.42 150.13 B: you would you would 

150.36 151.63 B: yeah 

151.83 152.72 B: yeah 

153.15 154.18 B: mhm 

157.24 163.43 B: that's right that's right i think he went with i'm not sure but maybe adidas and they are less expensive 

157.41 158.78 A: so much money 

162.65 165.41 A: yes he would not do he wouldn't do it 

165.14 166.38 B: you're right 

166.06 172.72 A: so you know he could've i mean he could've did something like that and to have his name i think that they would they would have did it 

172.24 178.61 B: but i'm i'm just wondering if like if the basketball peop- you know guys went on strike [sigh] 

178.70 187.26 B: do you think that when they did come back and they got more money that everybody would still be [sigh] you know buying the high price tickets and going to the games 

186.80 189.51 A: (( i don't know i think everybody would be a little upset )) 

189.28 193.33 B: uh well because they were after that one baseball strike years ago 

192.01 193.80 A: yeah i remember 

193.48 197.43 B: i mean people were not going to the game i was so thrilled that they weren't 

197.29 198.46 A: yeah 

197.70 210.48 B: because we don't have a baseball team here but i know i wouldn't have gone and i gotta tell ya of course we lost our basketball team too they're in [laughter] new orleans but um i don't think that if they went on strike for more money that i would be 

200.58 201.56 A: yeah 

210.78 215.30 B: i i don't think i could buy a ticket and support them for a long long time 

214.76 216.01 A: i know 

215.96 221.37 B: ye uh uh now if they go on strike for other reasons other than more money 

221.22 221.99 A: (( huh )) 

221.40 225.66 B: like let's say the last time they were thinking about going on strike 

225.20 226.02 A: (( huh )) 

225.53 237.15 B: was because of their benefits and they were gonna take away the retirement [sigh] well even then you know they make so much money now they don't even need retirement as far as i'm concerned 

234.68 236.19 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

236.50 247.00 A: yeah 'cause you can put away that much money that's like some that's like a rich person you know paying poor you know a ten thousand dollar interest policy or something you know 

242.12 243.25 B: [laughter] 

246.59 247.62 B: i know 

247.48 252.96 A: you know you have the money yeah and you could pay for your you know funeral and all that that's i don't know 

247.74 249.32 B: and they could take that 

252.66 260.50 B: they could take you're right they could take that salary and save it for their retirement they don't need that extra for retir- and they make good retirements too 

256.35 257.97 A: yeah some of it 

260.15 261.77 A: yeah 

261.17 273.85 B: which i don't think they deserve [laughter] at all but here's the other side of the coin just like this young kid from akron ohio lebron james and we went to see him playing in greenville not long ago 

263.38 265.33 A: [laughter] i don't either 

269.26 270.09 A: mhm 

270.26 271.14 A: mhm 

273.38 274.26 A: uh-huh 

274.09 282.98 B: now he is going to make probably five or six million just as a sign on bonus when 'cause you know they're gonna draft him into the n._b._a. 

282.43 283.76 A: right 

282.98 295.50 B: and he's right out of high school and he's very good but let's say the first year when he gets his five or six million and then let's say he gets hurt and let's say it's something really drastic like he breaks a leg 

286.04 286.77 A: mm 

295.09 295.96 A: uh-huh 

295.56 300.80 B: or something that he cannot come back and play basketball 

300.19 301.79 A: (( yeah )) 

301.47 308.47 B: then you know it's like okay he's got plenty of money [laughter] he do- 

306.37 307.46 A: (( mm )) 

307.60 314.09 A: but that's like tina turner you know her legs is insured for you know a whole [laughter] bunch of money 

313.62 314.77 B: that's true 

314.33 320.61 A: i've seen her on oprah and i guess the those players have to ensure their bodies you know like that too 

319.73 321.10 B: yes they do 

321.11 329.10 B: they do that's right the minute the sign um i forget the name of the company that um yep they're insured in case they can't play 

321.34 322.10 A: yeah 

322.54 323.46 A: yeah 

323.81 324.93 A: yeah 

328.79 330.63 A: (( yeah 'cause it [mn] )) 

330.56 334.44 B: it's gotten way out of hand you know and i don't know what we can do about it 

334.30 340.08 A: yeah it is way out of hand but that that's why i don't think that they should be giving into the strikes 

339.74 340.63 B: uh-uh 

340.94 341.81 B: uh-uh 

341.40 345.73 A: i don't think they should give into the strikes 'cause they're just making too too much money 

344.45 348.96 B: and if they're gonna do that then guess what i think everybody should stop buying tickets and going 

348.50 353.32 A: yeah because my and my thing too is look at the teachers 

353.66 355.06 B: look at the what 

353.83 362.80 A: teachers the teachers the teachers don't make enough money [laughter] and the teachers are in charge of your children it you know the most important thing to you 

355.67 356.47 B: yes 

356.99 358.85 B: i know it well 

360.71 361.82 B: amen 

362.24 363.44 B: mhm 

363.04 366.08 A: they need to give the teachers mon- more money 

365.59 373.75 B: amen i have said for years and they make less here in uh the carolinas than up north we're from ohio and they make a lot more up there 

370.13 371.10 A: oh yeah 

373.27 374.28 A: (( oh )) 

373.78 375.44 B: but i say those 

375.78 380.27 B: those and the policemen are the most underpaid people 

379.55 382.21 A: yeah for the jobs that they do 

380.32 382.84 B: in the world and that that's right 

382.25 393.34 A: and my daughter she well i have a daughter just graduated and i wanted her to teach but she said no way she said mom the teach- all the teachers are saying that after we graduate this is going to be their last year 

392.83 393.98 B: mhm 

393.52 395.20 A: you know they can't afford to 

394.36 404.91 B: well that's why we're we're in such a shortage here because you know first up we don't 'em second off the kids are getting away with murder in this schools and in the junior high and high schools they're scared to death 

399.19 400.20 A: mhm 

402.31 403.33 A: yes 

404.44 409.24 A: yeah and this it it's the same that the the teachers are scared to go to work 

405.30 406.25 B: you know 

408.81 411.28 B: uh why can't the teachers go on strike 

411.15 419.22 A: yeah they need to strike and i i bet they've more back uh people backing them in the [laughter] bask- basketball players 

415.02 417.91 B: i'm serious if these multi million 

418.73 427.12 B: yeah i'm serious i i don't know if they're in a union or not but you would think that they'd be able to go on strike to get more money 

420.80 422.02 A: mhm 

426.48 429.16 A: yeah 'cause [mn] it is ridiculous 

429.09 433.01 B: uh it is but i tell you what some of the sports 

433.04 436.93 B: like even well nascar even they're making good money too 

436.10 437.17 A: yeah 

436.81 448.69 B: but i think basketball baseball and football are the three top ones where it's just gotten so far out of hand that you know [sigh] that i don't know if there's anything i 

441.04 441.98 A: yeah 

444.16 445.68 A: (( oh yeah )) 

448.63 452.07 B: i mean they put a salary cap on the teams for football 

452.15 454.63 B: but it's not low enough [laughter] 

453.90 455.57 A: yeah [laughter] 

454.93 456.71 B: it's not i 

456.81 457.70 A: yeah 

456.87 459.59 B: don't think basketball even has a salary cap 

459.28 462.60 A: i don't think they do either i'm doing a survey 

460.91 462.30 B: and i don't know 

462.42 467.53 B: i don't know about baseball i don't know if they do or they don't but it's um 

467.92 469.26 B: it's not fair 

469.69 474.88 A: how many oh get my purse how how many um surveys have you done 

475.04 476.35 B: um just two 

476.27 477.27 A: just two 

476.93 478.17 B: mhm 

477.52 479.54 A: this is like my fourth one 

479.23 480.63 B: oh is it really 

480.00 482.45 A: mhm uh well how did you hear about it 

482.36 485.37 B: [sigh] i don't even remember isn't that uh

514.73 516.22 B: oh my goodness 

515.25 525.98 A: and and they called her on her cellphone to do the survey and she yeah and she's like i'm you know running around doing this or but anyway what is [laughter] 

518.23 520.17 B: oh for goodness sake 

524.66 536.02 B: i don't even i mean i you know i've about said all i can think to say about these uh professional athletes 'cause it just disgusts me the money they make and then they wanna go on strike and 

536.10 546.38 B: you know i don't know what else they hope to get out of us through this ten minute conversation but i don't think there's probably too many people that are for them going on strike you know 

540.17 541.20 A: (( yeah )) 

545.86 548.21 A: no nobody they're no 

548.02 549.88 B: and and like i said i i

551.11 560.75 A: you know just struggling to pay our bills and and everything and you thinking about they're complaining 'cause they make so many millions of dollars a year when you know 

553.41 554.54 B: no kidding 

559.82 560.51 B: i 

560.56 563.22 B: i almost wish i didn't know how much they made 

562.91 564.38 A: yeah that's what i 

563.42 575.74 B: i really do because it's just it puts a sour taste in my mouth about when i find out how well paid they are and you know i almost wish i really didn't know it's almost like just keep it a secret and don't tell me 

569.66 571.10 A: (( yeah as in )) 

575.60 581.16 A: yeah and all the you know all the younger kids they wanna go straight out of
