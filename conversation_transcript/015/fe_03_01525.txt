21.35 27.12 B: me either um actually i didn't think anybody was i knew the women m._b._a. players were talking about going on strike 

22.14 22.91 A: y- 

26.71 29.75 A: oh for for higher salaries 

29.51 30.99 B: i believe so 

30.46 32.13 A: okay 

32.42 34.36 B: and i think they're overpaid as it is 

34.05 42.65 A: yeah athletes yeah no definitely i agree um do you know what their like their claims are like why 

43.07 47.11 A: they would be going on a strike like just for more money or for 

47.03 51.04 B: well from what i understand it was strictly for more more money but 

50.42 51.71 A: wow 

51.88 52.94 A: (( yeah )) 

52.03 53.73 B: i don't have any idea 

53.37 59.98 A: mhm [laughter] yeah me neither um i remember the baseball strike earlier and i 

59.32 61.83 B: yeah a couple of years ago that was that was ridiculous 

61.18 63.83 A: that was ridiculous yeah 

63.91 66.64 A: yeah they get paid way too much 

66.47 68.50 B: yeah i would like their salary 

66.85 67.84 A: [laughter] 

68.36 71.39 A: (( [laughter] exactly if )) 

71.42 73.61 A: (( i could [cough] the only thing is that they're )) 

73.78 84.47 A: gonna raise prices for basketball games or baseball games or to you know for us to go to and i'm like they're already expensive as it is just to get a ticket to watch their games 

84.35 86.54 B: right to watch 'em run up and down the court 

84.69 85.82 A: (( you know )) 

86.33 93.04 A: yeah exactly exactly which is yeah which is a shame 'cause if it was more um 

93.23 99.68 A: it was more if it was less expensive i would go to more games and stuff i don't go to professional games very much because of that 

99.49 102.01 B: i don't either strictly because i refuse to pay the price 

101.56 104.01 A: yes exactly 

104.07 105.83 A: (( exactly that's right )) 

105.90 106.85 A: um 

106.07 108.32 B: but strikes i think are a bit ridiculous 

108.46 111.14 A: strikes in general or just in professional 

110.65 112.43 B: n- well in professional 

112.11 113.29 A: yes 

112.59 116.73 B: sports not in general because a lot of people that go on strike have very valid reasons 

116.09 119.18 A: exactly yeah yeah you know because 

119.46 133.14 A: you know these these overpaid athletes are you know griping over things that like other workers that do go on strike you know they can't even they're not even try- yeah exactly for like real things you know like paying bills and stuff 

128.02 129.58 B: they can't pay their bills 

133.81 135.83 A: so yeah 

135.33 139.49 B: i totally agree you make a million dollars and wanna go on strike so you can make two million 

138.49 140.86 A: [laughter] i know 

140.05 145.23 B: and joe blow that's on strike is lucky if they bring home fifteen thousand dollars a year 

144.71 149.98 A: exactly yeah yeah so i get really annoyed when i hear about stuff like that 

150.07 151.12 B: me too 

151.19 156.71 B: very very annoyed at you know most people in the u._s. live below the poverty line 

156.34 159.06 A: mhm yeah 

157.44 160.23 B: and you just you just raise the bar 

159.75 160.92 A: mhm 

160.29 161.79 B: and now you want more 

161.48 162.98 A: exactly 

162.34 167.48 B: not only do you get salary for being an athlete but you also get a salary for endorsements 

167.66 169.06 A: mhm 

167.79 175.73 B: public speaking engagements and you know you might have a contract for three and a half million but you make five million a year because you're in a nike commercial 

170.39 171.55 A: true 

175.52 179.72 A: true yeah i didn't even think about that that's very true 

179.72 180.41 B: so 

179.83 181.12 A: yeah 

180.48 186.94 B: you make eight and a half million you you pay in more in taxes than ten people together make in a year's time 

181.69 182.30 A: (( [mn] )) 

186.50 187.67 A: mhm 

187.94 190.71 B: and you don't have a valid reason you certainly want more money 

190.44 196.68 A: yeah that's so true and a lot of people bring up like how like you know back in the day 

196.68 206.96 A: uh people you know athlete's pay- you know just didn't get paid anything were hardly even making enough money to support their families but they just did it for the love of the game you know it was 

205.92 207.51 B: and that to me makes sense 

207.08 210.74 A: yeah yeah i just wish athletes today 

210.79 212.22 A: you know had that 

212.09 213.50 B: well it's it's such a 

213.75 224.88 B: they they set such a really sad bad example for like [noise] high school kids you know they're like oh i wanna play football or basketball so that i can be the next jordan or 

219.58 220.56 A: mhm 

224.51 225.56 A: (( yes )) 

225.07 228.97 B: you know whoever else so that i can make that eight and a half million dollars a year 

228.55 232.88 A: yes no and that's a problem too because then a lot of them don't 

232.66 244.56 A: uh focus on like their studies or whatnot and so they you know shoot to go to the m._b._a. or to the m._f._l. or whatever and you know only like one half of one percent of people who try out actually would make it 

244.40 250.11 A: so you know and then they neglect like they don't have like a back up you know because they spend so much time on sport 

250.25 253.75 A: and stuff which i think i think is a problem sometimes you know 

253.12 257.05 B: it's it's a very big problem they forget the whole purpose of going to school 

256.58 259.28 A: mhm yeah exactly 

258.50 263.04 B: and i mean if you live for money you're going to be really really sad one day [noise] 

262.82 264.24 A: mhm 

263.62 265.17 B: money doesn't buy happiness 

265.23 266.37 A: (( yes )) 

266.25 269.05 B: no matter how much you have obviously you still want more 

268.69 270.16 A: [laughter] 

270.41 272.39 A: (( yeah definitely )) 

272.27 275.57 B: but the strikes i don't understand if they had valid reasons like 

275.66 284.64 B: you know a lot of people strike because they just don't make any money or because they're benefits got cut or because there's you know prejudices and segregations and 

283.91 285.21 A: mhm 

284.97 286.63 B: those are valid reasons 

287.51 288.50 B: athletes 

287.75 289.16 A: i agree 

288.52 293.72 B: i don't remember an athlete's strike yet that wasn't for contract disputes and money 

294.68 296.17 A: exactly 

295.59 298.47 B: i remember an umpire's strike and i guess that affected 'em 

298.50 299.78 B: but i figure that um- 

298.66 304.29 A: oh the umpires i didn't know they striked before okay [mn] 

301.98 302.89 B: mhm 

304.58 307.62 B: went on strike once once that i can remember 

308.09 310.59 B: and and i'm sure you know that affected the game but 

310.50 311.52 A: mhm 

311.23 315.80 B: they were easily replaced by someone who would cross the picket line and 

315.63 316.98 A: mhm 

315.88 320.37 B: you know when the athlete's go on strike it's done and over there's no one that can replace them 

319.92 321.71 A: that's true 

321.83 325.13 B: and it's strictly for entertainment purposes so i i don't 

325.79 328.39 B: i i guess i just don't get it [laughter] 

327.04 330.05 A: (( yeah i don't get it [laughter] yeah at all )) 

330.25 331.76 A: (( uh )) 

333.30 335.94 B: there's no way i could i could see myself 

336.24 338.26 B: raising that kind of a stink 

338.97 351.16 A: exactly yeah and i don't kn- 'cause i'm sure a lot of these people come from a humble humble beginnings already so they should know like they don't need all that money i don- i don't know you know 

349.92 352.98 B: well money doesn't let you forget your struggles 

352.53 354.42 A: yeah 

354.24 361.88 B: and and i'm sure we're all happy when we progress to the next level but but there's gotta be there's gotta be an end to the madness at some point 

361.31 363.65 A: (( [laughter] yeah i agree )) 

364.39 366.88 B: it reinforces the greed in our society 

366.59 367.69 A: (( yes )) 

368.06 369.21 A: (( oh )) 

369.73 372.65 A: (( totally yeah it just makes no sense like i mean )) 

371.68 372.91 B: exorbitant 

372.81 373.93 A: (( oh go ahead )) 

373.16 373.89 B: pardon 

373.91 381.85 B: i said exorbitant salaries and ridiculous strikes and we pay how much is a how much is a ticket to a professional game like seventy five dollars maybe 

381.01 383.15 A: exactly yeah 

383.41 384.75 A: (( something like hat )) 

383.51 384.50 B: you know we 

384.62 389.01 B: we work really hard to make seventy five dollars to be able to to afford to watch you 

388.85 389.84 A: mhm 

389.56 392.23 B: and then you wanna take that bit of entertainment from us 

391.87 393.17 A: mhm 

393.53 398.82 B: for well i'm in memphis tennessee and we just got our our first professional team 

398.57 400.84 A: oh okay what what's that 

399.87 400.57 B: the 

400.61 402.62 B: the grizzlies yeah but 

401.55 403.09 A: oh okay okay 

402.96 404.59 B: they're not very good 

404.28 406.19 A: [laughter] 

405.48 415.85 B: they're really not but you gonna have a lot of support here and it's like you know in that respect yeah we're here to support you but at the same time you guys need to give something back to the community and stop so much worrying about yourself 

415.42 420.52 A: (( yeah that's what i think is a big problem like yeah a lot of these athletes i mean )) 

420.64 432.62 A: yeah they i think there should be an important part maybe like in their contract or something that they should give back to the community so it's all like so but they can understand our money is a like and you shouldn't try to get like 

432.56 446.65 A: all that money you know for yourself like you should like if they have more a connection with society i think that they they wouldn't be so you know greedy and money grabbing like you know so that they can like know it's important to give back 

446.67 454.18 A: and uh know that everyone like some people are struggling for a dollar and you're asking for another million dollars you know so 

453.64 455.63 B: it yeah exactly 

455.04 457.55 A: yeah i think that's important 

457.88 460.54 B: and you know you don't have to give your money back give your time 

460.57 463.33 A: (( yeah exactly yeah give ya time )) 

461.95 466.00 B: your time matters a lot more to people who don't have money than your money does 

464.45 465.45 A: mhm 

465.55 471.27 A: mhm yeah especially 'cause if your money doesn't go to do anything then yeah it's not 

471.40 472.73 A: not useful 

473.13 480.50 B: uh-uh i think definitely that that should be written into the contract and you know then they can strike because maybe they don't want to do it [laughter] 'cause 

480.28 481.38 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

480.62 482.63 B: they have to give up their time but 

483.05 484.21 A: (( yeah yes )) 

483.22 484.94 B: not for more money 

487.33 488.44 B: i don't get it 

488.04 490.36 A: (( mm yeah me neither )) 

492.13 494.05 B: who'd have thought running up and down 

494.13 496.35 B: sweating huffing and puffing 

496.45 501.83 B: could make that kind of money and the people who actually are the backbone of american society 

502.16 514.84 A: yeah [laughter] yeah it doesn't yeah it doesn't make it doesn't make any sense no i know like 'cause i think of whe- when i think of um you know people who are like unpaid and like underprivileged i figure like teachers and stuff who 

502.21 503.92 B: often get overlooked 

514.68 519.55 A: are probably like the most is ap- like probably one of the most important professions 

519.64 521.40 A: you know today 

520.60 522.46 B: as they're shaping our future 

522.02 526.58 A: yeah exactly exactly but you know they are so underpaid and 

526.74 533.55 A: and you know the professional athletes get all this mon- [mn] i don't yeah i don't get it it's just so unequal and it doesn't make any 

534.18 537.09 B: no it's it's there's not there's not any kind of 

534.45 535.28 A: (( sense )) 

537.13 545.77 B: of equation that i can think of that that equals out what they get what they demand and how little they have to get 

539.21 540.07 A: [laughter] 

545.46 546.69 A: yeah 

546.87 547.93 B: (( i i just )) 

547.82 550.41 A: (( exactly i don't i don't know )) 

549.05 550.12 B: don't understand 

550.46 552.90 A: (( yeah i don't know how it ended up like that )) 

553.83 555.35 B: obviously we let it 

555.74 557.07 A: (( mhm )) 

558.24 562.31 B: the multi million- i guess billion dollar industry and and 

562.05 563.04 A: mhm 

564.39 565.38 A: yeah 

564.73 573.03 B: our money our money our money tax money whatever supports it and we build you these fine multi million dollar facilities to play in 

573.15 575.56 B: and they jack up our city taxes and 

576.05 578.97 B: yeah we can't afford to pay it anyway and 

578.78 580.01 A: (( yeah )) 

579.08 581.01 B: and you get more money [laughter] 

580.32 581.84 A: [laughter] 

581.03 582.23 B: and pay less 

582.84 585.51 B: because you know most of them don't even live in the city that their 

585.67 586.93 B: their team is 

586.51 590.89 A: yeah no i know it yeah that's true mhm 

590.50 593.34 B: so we're getting nothing from it you're here a couple of months of the year 

593.39 594.59 A: mm 

594.46 595.45 B: you sweat 

595.70 598.49 B: you laugh you play hard and then you go home 

599.07 599.89 A: (( exactly ))
