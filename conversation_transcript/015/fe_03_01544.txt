455.51 457.04 A: yeah 

460.67 462.64 A: yeah we'll we have a 

461.36 462.43 B: but they gonna

467.80 468.64 B: (( mm )) 

471.08 472.16 B: that's it 

472.39 474.19 B: that is it 

473.27 475.94 A: keep them on the straight narrow you know 

475.48 480.77 B: mhm mhm because if they can't turn to nobody at least you know if they don't 

476.24 477.79 A: yeah

480.73 487.29 B: wanna talk to you they can talk to the somebody in the church and they'll give 'em good advice instead of turn them out to the streets 

483.56 484.49 A: yeah 

486.67 487.92 A: mhm 

487.23 499.24 B: and that's the worsest thing in the world that and that's what i tried to oh yes and i tried every- i mean i i tried to protect mine from the street which i did you know they tried to go out 

489.53 493.00 A: oh and that's what's scary right yeah 

497.60 499.34 A: (( good for you [mn] )) 

499.17 504.31 B: they tried to go out there but i was always there going to get 'em [laughter] 

502.78 516.44 A: i i think they always do you know i you know you like to think that they're aren't even gonna look or aren't even gonna try but i think that it's just too much of a temptation you know when they get to those teen years there's too much going on out there to 

509.75 510.77 B: (( mhm )) 

512.40 513.52 B: (( mhm )) 

516.21 518.08 A: for them to ignore it you know 

517.72 527.59 B: ab- absolutely uh-huh they wanna try things but they'll come back and they'll be your best friend 'cause right now my my two we have a wonderful relationship now 

519.64 520.51 A: (( yeah )) 

527.25 529.21 A: do you have sons or daughters 

529.10 533.19 B: uh my son is the twenty one year old and my daughter was twenty four year old 

532.51 536.06 A: oh so you had one of each that's kinda nice yeah 

533.90 541.60 B: one of each uh-huh that's how i got a chance to experience both side of the of raising boys and gir- a boy and a girl 

540.96 542.69 A: yeah that's nice 

542.40 545.85 B: uh-huh but i think my boy were easier than my girl 

545.23 546.29 A: (( is that right )) 

546.62 553.45 B: oh i guess because mothers are so fearful with their daughter i think if i had of been more relaxed i would have been okay [laughter] 

550.19 551.12 A: [laughter] 

553.68 554.80 A: oh well that's 

553.93 555.09 B: (( but i was )) 

555.35 561.94 A: i was gonna say that's probably true because having two girls i am certainly fearful you know yeah 

559.66 560.60 B: (( uh-huh )) 

560.86 573.74 B: because she's the one that little in school you know your girl she holler you like what's wrong you know you you react more but with a boy you don't too much react to much but you got to stay in touch with 'em 

566.41 568.45 A: [laughter] right 

573.33 574.68 A: yeah 

574.07 588.16 B: but yeah ove- i kinda overreacted with my daughter i i think some of the things i i overreacted on what wasn't very important and some that i didn't too much on it was more important but she turned out to be pretty good she's a nurse now 

576.99 577.95 A: [laughter] 

584.24 585.56 A: yeah 

587.97 590.86 A: oh she is that's great that's great 

589.10 598.24 B: uh-huh she went on she came on out of a school and became nurse she said she wanted to do what her mom does but there for a minute i thought she wasn't gonna do anything [laughter] 

594.65 595.56 A: uh-huh 

597.92 599.89 A: [laughter] well i think
