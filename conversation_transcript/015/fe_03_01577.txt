305.65 308.61 B: mhm right right but she said 

309.96 324.28 B: right but she said nothing no incidents and the security was fine and you know going through security no delays they were able to make the flight nothing no no nothing at all very uneventful going and coming 

319.66 320.58 A: mhm 

324.49 325.55 A: wow 

325.00 327.27 B: i know i know so 

327.42 337.83 B: you know i i i guess i have not heard any other than that one woman who missed her flight and i can understand the inconvenience um no problems with the security measures

338.00 339.08 A: wow 

338.57 340.64 B: mhm mhm 

340.05 340.89 A: (( hm ))

343.13 346.86 A: (( oh how long have we been talking for [laughter] )) 

346.01 348.21 B: i don't know but i know it was 

348.48 351.51 B: [laughter] it was more than what what did they say 

351.52 353.52 A: i think they said ten minutes 

352.93 354.09 B: oh okay 

353.65 354.60 A: so 

354.75 358.45 A: uh airport security um [laughter] 

357.40 362.15 B: [laughter] um where would you normally fly out of 

362.42 367.18 A: um well i used to live in new jersey so i usually flew out of new york 

366.52 367.76 B: (( oh okay )) 

367.71 369.12 A: (( and you're um )) 

367.91 368.88 B: okay 

369.35 375.25 A: but i've also flown out of uh j._k._f. new york and la guardia 

369.44 370.09 B: (( um )) 

372.79 373.83 B: mhm 

374.94 376.01 B: mhm 

375.88 376.78 A: um 

377.68 386.96 A: [sigh] the one time i went to europe [laughter] i flew out of la guardia 'cause it was just a lot cheaper you know using i used one of those like online things and you know 

380.31 381.32 B: mhm 

382.93 383.94 B: right 

386.63 389.40 B: right right mhm 

387.35 388.46 A: i find 

389.18 401.05 A: so la guardia was a lot cheaper but it was pretty far away so my brother drove me there in the middle of the night and left me there [laughter] for like four hours until my plane took off [laughter] 

393.70 394.66 B: yeah 

398.77 399.63 B: oh 

399.93 402.04 B: (( wow wow )) 

401.71 403.17 A: [laughter] 

402.15 410.81 B: goodness well middle of the night at least you could sleep but i think that's the best time to fly to europe is at night you get on the plane and you can go to sleep 

407.12 407.97 A: yeah 

408.70 409.58 A: yeah 

410.75 411.68 A: yeah 

411.07 414.27 B: [laughter] wake up with the sun in your eyes the next morning 

414.30 416.05 A: yeah [laughter] 

414.79 421.63 B: mhm [laughter] i normally well i i used to fly out of um the west chester airport 

421.64 424.76 B: uh it was closer because i live in connecticut 

424.80 425.72 A: mhm 

424.97 432.73 B: but then i found that it was just as close to go to bradley international in hartford and and um 

433.13 441.44 B: uh no problem i mean i was able to get in and out it was just my first time ever flying and fortunately it was um 

438.77 439.61 A: wow 

441.57 449.23 B: [mn] right after nine eleven so what could be more safer than to fly right after the incident [laughter] so uh 

445.33 446.21 A: right 

446.39 447.75 A: [laughter] 

448.52 450.63 A: i guess that's one way of thinking of it 

450.12 457.83 B: yeah it was it was it weren't no problem i'm saying it was i couldn't believe it it was just great everyone talked about the high security and i thought 

457.85 463.05 B: well i know i'm gonna be delayed but i was in and out in and out it was perfect [lipsmack] 

463.28 467.12 B: it was great mhm and i chucked my luggage so 

463.30 464.23 A: wow 

467.16 474.72 B: you know i didn't want to carry the bulky carry on uh because they did have they went through everything and they had restrictions on the size 

467.75 468.31 A: (( [mn] )) 

474.64 475.69 A: right 

475.04 479.40 B: so um i chucked it so it was fine it was fine 

479.55 486.45 B: but i think on this next trip that we take we're gonna fly out of um new york only like you it's cheaper 

486.46 487.42 A: mhm 

486.64 493.01 B: you know because they have more more flights going out of new york [mn] the larger airport 

489.62 490.55 A: yeah 

493.06 494.35 A: mhm 

493.57 495.41 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

495.64 498.18 A: yeah uh i wonder if um 

495.64 496.37 B: (( yep )) 

498.47 508.57 A: do you know anyone's whose taken a a train like amtrack or anything recently i wonder if th- they they do the same things or anything with security now because i have a friend who just took 

508.66 512.61 A: an amtrack all the way from philadelphia to portland and um 

511.64 512.50 B: mhm

528.84 530.14 A: (( for terrorism )) 

529.82 534.64 B: no no but i mean i guess they would still have to be on some type of alert 

534.49 535.54 A: yeah 

535.35 538.29 B: uh i um no i hadn't heard anything 

538.35 540.25 B: about that that's interesting
