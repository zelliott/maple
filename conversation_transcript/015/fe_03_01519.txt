3.19 5.73 A: hello my name is colleen 

6.49 9.36 A: what do you think about the strike situation 

9.96 11.64 B: i think it's kinda 

11.74 13.45 B: (( ah overrated to me )) 

14.23 15.67 B: 'cause it's like 

15.92 19.67 B: they think they need more money than what everyone else has 

19.25 24.08 A: i know i know i have a problem with that also um 

24.61 26.92 A: i mean sometimes i think 

27.48 29.83 A: how much money do you need 

29.79 31.16 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

32.52 35.07 A: the rest of us are just 

35.41 41.47 A: everyday people and i guess can't imagine that the salaries that they want is 

42.25 45.05 A: is just overblown i think 

44.96 53.73 B: yeah i think it's up to a point to where ah they're just trying to get publicity out of it trying to get more money coming into the teams 

53.78 55.99 A: that could very well be 

57.11 65.74 A: do you have a problem with it because it gets difficult for you to go to some of the games and afford the prices [mn] 

65.72 72.82 B: yeah the prices are out of range like to sit on the floor at a basketball game is like two hundred and fifty dollars 

67.75 69.03 A: right 

73.01 74.86 B: it's like so overrated 

74.59 83.00 A: that's awful and then if you take a family it's really impossible to do that i think 

82.29 83.04 B: (( well yes )) 

85.09 89.19 B: and they and they're trying to strike on getting more money out of this 

89.11 91.65 A: right right right 

92.23 101.79 A: so do you um are you able to go to many games or does this um leave a bad feeling so that you don't even do that

106.46 110.46 A: okay okay but you do enjoy enjoy them

116.55 117.52 A: true 

117.77 126.86 A: well and it always seems that once they have a strike it takes a while for people to forget that and to come back again 

126.87 128.58 B: right yeah 

128.07 131.11 A: yeah i think so too i know we were

146.35 147.63 B: right

292.45 294.66 A: comes the end of that so 

294.17 295.21 B: right 

295.07 297.47 A: i hope that doesn't happen here

345.08 347.18 A: but and now 

347.68 352.92 A: you know with the war and the economy we don't hear so much about it anymore so 

352.45 354.03 B: (( right yeah )) 

353.49 356.43 A: maybe they're gonna put it on the back burner but 

356.81 363.72 A: people just can't seem to afford that either we're paying the players so much money and 

362.70 364.06 B: right 

364.51 367.42 A: nobody wants their taxes to go up 

367.36 368.44 B: right

380.36 381.68 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

384.52 385.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

387.75 389.68 B: [noise] i mean i don't know what the other 

389.78 393.07 B: side of the topic could be because you know yeah 

392.81 397.25 A: well i don't i don't either i mean if you know unless you're one of the 

397.37 400.47 A: one of the players [laughter] 

399.01 399.98 B: [laughter] 

400.69 406.42 A: 'cause i i would imagine the owners aren't very happy when they go on strike either to you know 

406.36 407.31 B: right 

406.71 409.85 A: to talk about it or threaten it it's 

410.56 414.74 A: it doesn't do them any good either they're trying to make money i'm sure 

414.46 415.83 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

416.43 420.21 A: we have a texan that owns our vikings here 

420.24 421.48 A: (( mccombs )) 

421.59 422.85 B: yeah 

422.64 426.74 A: so i don't know if he's gonna keep them here or not but 

427.17 434.87 A: when they argue about they pay sometimes i think people just say well go some place else and [laughter] you know if 

433.99 435.55 B: (( [laughter] yeah it just )) 

435.19 436.91 A: that's the way you feel 

438.03 438.79 A: (( but )) 

438.93 442.98 A: they just can't seem to be satisfied for some reason or other 

444.81 446.62 B: comes down to greed 

446.07 449.28 A: yeah i think you're right i think that's true 

450.26 458.37 A: although some of them i guess i i i guess some do a lot for different charities and so forth but 

458.66 459.33 B: (( right )) 

459.01 467.87 A: maybe we don't always hear about that and i'm sure when there's a strike there's some of them that don't don't want to strike 

461.55 462.48 B: yeah 

467.37 469.48 B: (( yeah they just wanna play )) 

469.27 471.90 A: yep so 

472.73 475.61 A: those are the ones i feel bad for 

479.97 484.93 A: look we watch we watch a lot of sports so we feel bad when they aren't on 

485.18 486.27 B: yeah 

485.67 493.98 A: it's good entertainment for us [mn] we don't go to a lot of games but we do watch them on television so 

494.04 500.48 B: yeah i think it's a lot more interesting watching it on t._v. than actually going to the game 

499.65 514.61 A: well it's well for sometimes i think too i get distracted at the games i get too busy watching people [laughter] and i don't always catch the plays and you know this way they'll have you know 

507.39 508.40 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

514.52 515.44 B: yeah

521.91 536.05 A: keeping tr- yeah keeping track of the puck [laughter] but football i understand i love basketball and i enjoy baseball although i think it's the game has gotten pretty slow 

536.21 537.99 B: yeah 

539.54 540.57 A: (( [mn] but )) 

542.61 546.72 A: so we hope that all the teams will just keep playing 

547.26 548.46 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

549.86 552.20 B: it's an american passtime
