13.36 18.78 A: okay um this is about my fifth call with this company and i find this just fascinating um 

18.85 23.44 A: today's topic is strikes by professional sports um 

23.46 38.32 A: i'm definitely against them i think they are making so much money now as it is i just think that it's gotten to the point where the average family cannot even afford to go to these venues to to watch baseball or football 

38.28 41.35 A: and it's it's just gotten out of hand 

40.74 44.06 B: i think all athletes get paid too much money nowadays 

43.69 51.46 A: oh absolutely and the strikes themselves i i i personally the only time i was ever involved in a strike was i had 

51.48 59.81 A: won a contest from a local newspaper here in minneapolis where my family and i actually won a trip to boston for four 

59.85 70.61 A: to yeah to watch the twins play and we were going to be their professional guests of honor they were gonna fly us out there put us up in the hotel at the twin inn we were gonna go to a banquet

70.48 77.96 A: and get spending money and the whole bit now this was back in i think it was ninety nineteen ninety ninety one i can't remember it's been a while 

77.85 82.71 A: but it was a four thousand dollar trip you know it was the first time i've ever won anything like that 

79.65 80.70 B: wow 

82.28 83.22 B: mhm 

82.59 94.82 A: i was just absolutely thrilled and then the strike happened and [laughter] and it dragged on and on and on and we never got to go no but what 

89.35 92.11 B: oh so you missed the whole thing 

94.20 95.04 B: well 

94.76 100.36 A: what finally happened was um there was um an earthquake in kobe japan 

99.94 102.16 B: [laughter] yeah 

100.37 101.33 A: (( in )) 

101.24 106.85 A: february and i told ya i told my family i said you know i don't think we're ever going to go on this trip 

106.12 107.06 B: [laughter] 

106.74 121.26 A: i said how do how do you feel about us donating that money to help those poor people in japan because it was in the winter time and i was thinking gosh they're suffering in the same kind of weather we are here in minnesota so that's what we did we just donated the we contacted the uh 

121.23 124.66 A: the star tribune and the twins and they thought that was just great so 

124.33 126.91 B: (( well that's a wonderful thing for you to have done )) 

125.73 134.51 A: yeah but it really kind of screwed it for us [laughter] so we i still haven't been to boston because of that strike [laughter] i'll get there some day 

128.08 129.76 B: yes well 

131.54 133.23 B: oh well 

133.47 147.67 B: boston'll be there [laughter] [laughter] yeah well i just i think with the the strikes and things like that i i don't think that that's correct and in the way that these people act nowadays it 

134.99 137.77 A: yeah [laughter] it's not going anywhere 

137.82 139.37 A: (( oh it's terrible )) 

147.07 148.36 A: oh i know 

147.65 151.88 B: the the real i would say i 

151.90 155.81 B: (( was not going to say joy but you know the idealism )) 

156.00 161.27 B: for children and sports events and people have gone out the window 

160.84 164.15 A: oh i know they're they're role models for youngsters 

162.81 165.80 B: yes they were supposed to be but not anymore 

165.11 169.56 A: no and it's a shame and and they're using their their money and their fame 

169.46 181.55 A: for just you know selfish um means and they not promoting their sports and maybe maybe there's just a couple of bad that are doing it and all the rest of 'em are doing the job like they're supposed to but 

172.69 173.94 B: right 

181.56 183.92 A: it it's just such a shame that 

181.57 182.36 B: it 

183.00 196.07 B: it's i think when when people strike well i don't like striking anyhow but sometimes it's a necessity but i think when people strike especially those people that make that much money and they strike because they want more 

196.20 206.49 B: that and they're and if they're bad role models i think they should get rid of them i mean they get rid of employees that are bad why can't they get rid of them [laughter] 

200.62 201.48 A: yeah 

204.41 215.82 A: absolutely not only that but i think the strikes are the ones that it hurts the little the little guy i mean it puts everybody out of business the people who are selling the hot dogs and the tee shirts and the ticker takers 

209.39 210.24 B: right 

213.31 214.41 B: mhm 

215.73 230.64 A: and all the people who clean up the restrooms after the games and all those people what do they do you know they're out of a job and when they do go back to work yeah and and when they get back to work where where does their money come from they're not going to get an increase in their salary 

219.08 220.13 B: right 

221.23 222.09 B: right 

222.93 225.25 B: and and what do they care 

228.06 229.29 B: that's right 

230.80 232.10 A: (( it's it's the )) 

230.84 232.42 B: i agree with that 

232.35 242.61 A: yeah i i think strikes uh served the purpose in this country when we had the sweatshops and um you know child labor laws that were necessary but in so many instances 

240.93 246.47 B: you know even that is you know that's so many years past now they're they're just not there any more 

244.32 245.62 A: exactly 

245.80 256.90 A: yeah but now the unions are just for always squeezing you know every last drop out of [laughter] out of management and you know i mean it's just and somebody's got to pay for it 

252.49 255.44 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

255.64 265.30 B: i know and i said the other day we were just talking about that the other day i says remember when you go to the movies i said the tickets would cost ya a quarter a dollar 

264.82 266.06 A: mhm 

265.28 275.03 B: i said now it costs you ten dollars to get one ticket to a movie and twenty five or thirty dollars to go see a baseball game [laughter] 

271.88 279.90 A: i know i know and we haven't been to a game now it's been about two years and and one of the main reasons we went was we got free ticket 

279.85 289.47 A: so we took um my my husband myself and my daughter and she took a friend and i was just saying i don't know how people can afford to do this you know when they go out and buy the tickets 

288.60 290.24 B: (( no not any more )) 

289.83 291.16 A: yeah and then you know 

290.53 294.37 B: and then what happens to those people that have paid for their season tickets 

293.87 300.80 A: oh i know who can afford season tickets any more [laughter] oh my gosh it it is it's just unfortunate 

295.74 298.57 B: well you know [laughter] really i 

300.49 301.49 B: know 

301.19 310.92 A: i i just wish that uh the people who really counted like the teachers you know at at our schools in america could get salaries like that you know the people 

309.76 315.33 B: i know the people that who really do the work are are the ones that really deserve it 

312.43 313.65 A: exactly 

314.76 320.63 A: yeah you think athletes are bad how about the movie stars [laughter] i mean they're even worse 

315.72 316.94 B: and 

318.39 321.53 B: [laughter] yes yeah i know those two 

321.10 325.96 A: getting twenty two million dollars to make one film i mean really 

325.03 336.10 B: i know [laughter] something i it's just i don't like it now that i can that i have to pay for a car the same that i used to pay for house 

326.30 328.77 A: what is wrong with this country [laughter] 

335.63 339.13 A: (( oh i know isn't that just unreal i just )) 

335.94 345.00 B: [laughter] i and it's because it i really feel it's because people like the people that are in sports 

345.01 349.93 B: that have gotten higher and higher wages and it's everything is 

349.97 352.65 B: goes in accordance with everything else 

351.04 351.96 A: yeah 

352.04 355.59 A: everything does because that money's got to come from somewhere 

355.13 356.03 B: right 

355.65 359.63 A: you know every time those salaries go up then the tickets go up you bet 

358.64 365.62 B: and or and and they have to have a new stadium every other year [laughter] [mn] [laughter] 

361.96 372.51 A: oh we've been dealing with that [laughter] i feel bad about it because my husband works for a company that is an architectural firm and they wanted to design the new twins stadium 

372.28 378.11 A: but uh the uh climate in minnesota was they didn't not want any taxpayer dollars to go for it 

378.13 391.95 A: so they've they've shot down every single proposal for a stadium and part of me is going yay no more taxes and the other part of me is going oh boo that's a job my husband could be working on [laughter] so we're kinda caught between a rock and a hard place so 

387.59 389.72 B: [laughter] 

390.76 392.51 B: [laughter] right 

392.16 403.84 A: i think i i have to go with the taxpayers side because we've got multi million dollar business owners who don't want to chip in any money but they want a brand new stadium 

403.52 408.95 B: right and we've got a they just did a uh thing down here uh 

404.19 406.02 A: uh and the stadium 

409.15 412.79 B: our baseball our basketball team left from charlotte 

412.42 413.56 A: oh 

413.32 418.29 B: and they went down to florida so they brought in tried to bring in a new one 

418.55 427.72 B: so they're trying to decide who has the most money to come in [laughter] and the persons coming in want another new stadium [laughter] 

421.43 423.06 A: yeah absolutely 

426.14 427.00 A: yeah 

427.21 435.38 A: it's and it's just like that all over it's it's and that kind of mentality's spread because it's like uh we've local fire departments here 

435.28 443.00 A: one fire department gets a new fire station and everybody else wants a new one too and someone gets a new fire truck you know 

440.40 445.78 B: oh wow i know it it it goes it goes from person to person it really does 

444.74 456.83 A: exactly it's like these boys want their toys and they wanna show 'em off to their other boys you know and [laughter] that's about what it is only now you're talking multi million dollars you know but 

447.72 448.62 B: yeah 

450.04 454.05 B: (( [laughter] )) 

455.60 457.57 B: right right 

456.98 461.65 A: oh they must have some big old club somewhere that these owners get together 

460.45 468.70 B: [laughter] i think you're right about that [laughter] 

461.66 465.63 A: [laughter] chew on their cigars and talk about 

465.66 467.84 A: [laughter] it's just nuts

517.36 518.33 A: yeah 

525.68 531.27 B: getting so much more money and it's got so commercial for me i really didn't even like it anymore
