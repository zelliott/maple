0.40 1.61 A: hello 

1.99 3.28 B: hello 

2.87 6.84 A: hi my name is kelly and i'm from pennsylvania how are you 

7.05 11.00 B: hi i'm rajan uh uh i'm from texas how are you 

10.71 16.83 A: good good how are your feelings on this with the the salaries of the players 

17.41 30.05 B: uh well actually being from at university i do feel like not to be fair with them uh sometimes it's better to pay them like you know based on the contract basis or something 

29.69 31.35 A: correct i 

30.69 36.14 B: yeah i mean like you know based on the seniority of the players [noise] so 

36.16 41.59 B: oh regarding that as considering that into the picture they should start paying them 

42.28 48.36 B: oh what do you i mean what do you have to say like about the players like you know the payment exactly 

47.64 60.17 A: well i'm kinda like you know the issue with the striking is kind of a little odd to me because they do make such incredible amounts of money and undoubtedly they have a talent and god bless them for the money they can make and what they've been blessed with 

59.96 74.58 A: however i'm not so sure that um you know they should be com- compensated in the way they are i mean there's so many people in the world that are jobless and you know i know they do bring a lot of revenue into the country with what they do and so on but um 

74.76 88.39 A: [lipsmack] you know as far as their their salaries and their ability to strike i guess it's kind of uh something i can't really comprehend or understand you know i come from a middle class family and you know we work hard and 

88.25 96.71 A: you know i feel like well they just work a couple you know they work the s- work through the season and they're making money that i may never make in my lifetime you know 

91.42 92.39 B: mhm 

96.59 97.70 B: yeah 

97.15 110.37 A: so and uh however on the other hand you know i do understand that they have a talent and that you know they bring a lot of money in um into the country from what they do and that they generate a lot of money during their seasons and so on um 

110.34 113.36 A: but i guess for me it's just a little hard to comprehend 

113.62 116.21 A: um do you have any other feelings on the topic 

115.90 126.90 B: mhm yeah actually being from a university i'm in no i'm i'm studying my masters and like in the university i've been seeing so many athletics or or athletes who keep practising so much like you know 

126.77 136.28 B: or they they start working right from the beginning of the day and then like you know ev- every every other place where they go they'll have competitions too you know 

131.28 132.24 A: right 

135.98 137.46 A: (( right [mn] )) 

136.18 150.20 B: or there'll be a lot of competition for them and they need to keep up with that and that this athletics it's uh such a kind of thing that you know it won't uh continue for the lifelong like you know they might be able to win like 

149.99 153.42 B: (( up to thirty years or thirty five years you know )) 

152.43 153.59 A: right 

153.49 160.90 B: they'll have to get retired from that and they'll have to find a job for themselves it's a different kind of thing yeah 

157.47 159.64 A: right so i guess if they're making that kind of 

160.29 166.52 A: right if they make that kinda money then they won't have to worry about it after they retire if they uh invest it correctly i guess [laughter] 

166.15 180.23 B: yeah at least they'll have some kind of security and you know that will be oh oh like a fair amount of thing for whatever work they did in the first few years of their uh field or field actually and i 

175.82 176.89 A: right 

179.13 181.90 A: i guess for oh i'm sorry go ahead 

180.13 181.24 B: yeah 

181.78 183.51 B: (( you go ahead go ahead i'm sorry )) 

183.06 197.21 A: i guess i was saying like you know i mean they do get all kinds of endorsements the the big players anyway i mean i don't know much about these players that sit the bench and what their salaries are com- in comparison but you know the really high paying players after they retire when they're all done 

197.00 206.55 A: they go on to do so much more where i'm sure they're still being paid close to you know millions of dollars to endorse products and continue to 

206.32 215.29 A: just kinda you know put themselves out there in the media and so on you know for other i guess they encourage other players and just 'cause they're always a part of history 

215.11 226.32 A: you know they they go around for a good part of the rest of their life making just as much money um as far as the striking i guess i mean i'm not someone i i like to watch sports but i'm i'm not an avid 

226.15 233.87 A: follower of everything that they do in sports so i don't know much about exactly the reasons for wanting to strike when they do and so on 

233.89 234.85 A: (( so )) 

234.60 241.69 B: mhm mhm mhm mhm yeah that's one thing maybe like you know rather than going for the strike they can uh come up with a reasonable deal with the 

241.50 253.77 B: (( uh all the managers or whoever sponsors for them but one thing it's not everyone like you know uh climb up all the way up to the higher level and make all the money like you know )) 

245.16 246.34 A: right 

253.42 254.73 A: exactly 

253.68 267.18 B: they can make it they can uh not everyone can go out and uh represent their country and get a name and then get a sponsorship and all those things but if you consider some of the athletes like you know who just represent a state and all 

262.17 263.14 A: right 

267.11 271.16 B: uh they might not get the endorsement from the sponsors you know 

270.84 272.15 A: exactly a 

271.06 282.58 B: so that they uh not everyone can be a a super athlete like you know yeah so that they like uh uh or probably they should you know uh divide the athletes according to the 

274.60 275.69 A: (( super star )) 

276.19 277.16 A: right 

282.49 288.22 B: (( uh level of the commitment or like how much uh time they can dedicate towards this one )) 

287.93 288.96 A: right 

288.40 294.28 B: and how how much they are coping out with uh uh uh present day competition 

294.32 304.14 B: and then they can they should fix their contract or something and oh probably the contract should be given something like a a per year basis and then keep on extending it later on 

303.86 305.32 A: yeah that sounds like 

304.57 306.40 B: based on their performance 

306.15 307.27 A: right 

306.69 311.55 B: probably that way it it'll be kind of fair among both the sides you know 

311.20 313.23 A: exactly i agree 

313.36 315.36 A: i i definitely agree 

315.53 316.54 A: um 

315.94 326.36 B: yeah but yeah but see like seeing the way they they bring up their country and aware of what they represent uh in what was this process 

326.06 327.15 A: right 

326.58 340.24 B: not oh i- i- it's kind of fair to like you know oh provide some kind of uh other facilities to them also like probably giving some for their education and also other kind of uh things 

339.98 341.03 A: right 

343.87 344.82 A: um 

345.33 349.93 A: [lipsmack] are are you a follower of sports do you follow much uh sports now 

349.63 361.45 B: yeah i do even uh i do play quite a few games but uh yeah well uh usually i don't get much time but whenever i do get time i do uh keep follow the uh sports and all 

361.35 375.49 B: uh that's one reason like you know what makes me uh feel that you know uh justice to be done to whatever the amount of effort and the work they do put in like you know they're allowed to get up or they can't miss the practices every now and then 

375.10 377.29 A: right it's dedication 

375.61 376.56 B: lots of 

376.87 390.61 B: and their diet and then the body work everything uh they should be like you know if if they if they come out of it for a few days take a break from it for a few days they won't be uh really able to get back into it actually 

380.13 381.15 A: right 

389.93 391.33 A: exactly 

390.49 400.90 B: uh and throughout the year they need to keep working on un- or i would say like probably thirty five years is the last after that they won't be able to really work on it but uh 

399.52 400.51 A: right 

400.84 409.35 B: (( uh after that uh at least if they can have some amount of money as a security for them for their uh l- la- later part of life )) 

408.96 410.16 A: right 

409.57 418.05 B: (( uh that should probably like you know uh motivate uh them in a better way to go out and like you know get those more than )) 

416.19 425.33 A: right i guess i can kinda see from your perspective you've helped me to to understand a little bit better you know why people would agree with them and you are right i mean they do it's a lifelong com- 

425.21 433.27 A: commitment when they are involved and every morning getting up and it takes a lot of dedication it's not something like they can just call out of work or something 

433.29 434.21 B: mhm 

433.37 444.50 A: i i see where you're coming from and it's more it mental physical you know i i can see all that and surely i you know it helps me to understand a little bit more while they get why they get compensated the way they do 

444.55 454.47 A: um but i don't know i guess it just th- the whole strike thing like i said it's it's not something that i follow closely when it if and when it it does happen so 

444.79 446.62 B: mhm 

454.95 465.16 A: it's one of them things i guess i don't understand it as fully as i could but um you know what you're saying to me definitely helps to clarify on my part you know where they're coming from 

463.10 472.98 B: yeah but they're probably yeah actually for a person who was really experienced what exactly a sport is or for a person uh uh 

472.94 482.94 B: uh like you know what do you say uh was totally involved in the sports or they are uh a a person who who always follows the sports probably they should be able to you know 

482.73 483.69 A: right 

483.01 487.69 B: oh uh uh get the right kind of thing about these things 

487.44 488.57 A: right 

487.77 492.91 B: but i i understand like you know probably you don't follow the sports much and all this things 

492.59 506.61 A: right i was always one who you know i watch i watch occasional sports and i've i've played occasional sports but it's not something that i'm following all the little details every day i don't you know pick up the sports section and read it religiously every day so 

506.39 518.17 A: like i said some of the stuff's a little bit harder for me to comprehend but you know i i certainly can see where your your point is you know it's with seeing the the men dedicating themselves to their work and so on 

518.84 522.42 B: (( mhm yeah that's right i totally understand that )) 

524.68 526.73 B: so well what else uh 

526.93 528.79 B: (( how are things otherwise )) 

529.08 540.82 A: good very good just this whole you know it's a little bit awkward i guess when you get a topic that that makes it a little uh harder to [laughter] to to say a whole lot on you know um 

540.83 548.16 B: yeah but for me i guess it's uh kind of like fine because uh i'm kind of like involved in all the sports and i keep following all this things 

547.77 556.69 A: right and it helps that helps a lot you know i know that's where my my husband's always trying to keep me updated 'cause i just like to know about everything that's going on but um 

548.38 549.31 B: (( so mhm )) 

556.70 564.79 A: you know as far as like striking and stuff it's not something i've seen a lot of so so it's not something i've had a lot of experience in feeling towards 

564.79 574.78 A: um i guess the fans i don't know i guess the fans must react uh the people that have season ticket and stuff like that mustn't be too excited when these guys do strike 

574.94 577.73 A: i'm sure that that kinda ruffles their feathers a little 

576.14 581.55 B: yeah that's right there's there's so many people who go to every game and watch it like you know there's 

581.48 595.84 B: such a lot of ardent fans like who keep going from one match to the other probably they should be a lot worried about the strike whatever is going on between the athletes and the uh this things like you know this entertainment on all this stuff 

585.86 586.83 A: right 

595.59 599.89 A: right i wonder if they're supportive of the players all around as far as
