0.00 2.18 B: hi my name is samantha [noise] 

2.38 4.12 A: hi my name is marilyn writh 

4.18 5.28 B: hi 

5.94 7.48 B: how are you this evening 

7.11 8.81 A: good 

7.78 8.89 B: good 

9.02 14.13 B: um we're supposed to be speaking about the strikes of professional athletes 

14.33 20.99 B: which i believe is just a cry for attention to get more pub- publicity and get their names out 

21.84 24.64 B: and to make people end up 

24.75 28.69 B: paying them more attention so that they make more money 

29.23 31.14 B: and just media time 

32.21 38.54 A: um i tend i tend to think it's probably the same thing ah i think they're completely overpaid but at the same time 

39.81 40.73 A: um 

40.87 43.51 A: what they do their talent i guess ah 

43.98 45.22 A: is hard to 

45.87 47.05 B: right 

45.89 51.21 A: hard to duplicate so um is it worth is that type of 

52.09 58.26 A: uniqueness actually worth as much i don't think so i think there's not yeah 

55.38 62.46 B: i don't either and the fact that they were to strike over something as petty as most of them do 

63.29 66.38 B: just doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever 

67.06 73.06 A: i agree i mean if if we didn't have the type of i guess entertainment it's not going to affect 

73.60 78.10 A: world peace it's not going to affect any type of economic situation um 

77.80 80.39 B: exactly it's purely entertainment 

80.09 84.62 A: yeah ah so i agree i don't think it's actually something that's necessary 

84.79 85.78 A: um 

87.44 91.94 A: i mean yes they'd have to support families and such like that but we are also supporting them with 

92.51 96.89 A: not worth two million three million four million contracts per year so 

96.43 97.61 B: right 

97.43 98.44 A: um 

98.58 111.46 B: i mean i find myself [noise] watching many sports but it's not for purpose of to see who strike that day or who did whatever it's purely an entertainment 

99.86 100.78 A: [noise] 

111.34 122.30 A: yeah it is um i mean th- th- there's some of course people that they employ in terms of the um stadiums and such and they do have um 

122.72 124.56 A: their job depends upon 

124.97 128.77 A: the performance the actually events happening 

128.84 132.42 A: um but it is most of them are 

132.69 137.72 A: i think the type of labor where it can be [mn] found anywhere else 

137.15 138.30 B: right 

137.75 139.24 A: so um 

139.42 143.88 A: we can't be found as maybe a manager of a team and such but again 

144.39 147.41 A: how hard is that i don't know and 

147.36 154.87 B: and i see other people losing out because when one person strikes that's another that doesn't make their money for the day 

154.76 156.04 A: oh absolutely 

156.17 159.49 B: so it's not fair to them in that respect 

159.80 166.77 B: just because somebody is whining about something they didn't get or something that they want that's really just 

167.38 169.45 B: not even within reason 

169.71 173.65 A: yeah and and it's it's also very irresponsible the fact that they don't 

173.87 179.84 A: they didn't take that in consideration it's it's more what i'm not getting as opposed to well what can i be giving 

179.79 180.78 B: right 

180.04 184.98 A: if i just take two million a year as a salary as opposed to 

184.78 186.61 B: (( because there are )) 

185.35 186.19 A: three 

186.63 192.71 B: athletes that contribute so much to different charities or 

192.90 201.85 B: events but then there's the ones that complain constantly because they're not getting but they're not giving anything to get anything back 

202.47 205.16 A: [mn] yes i agree um i 

205.36 209.02 A: agree and it's it's i know it's just [sigh] 

210.70 216.67 A: the most of the ah who i find or what i understand from the professional athletes is 

216.79 219.36 A: you know their goals were mostly to 

219.67 227.58 A: play the sport and not obtain so- any kind of education as well so um if their livelihood is dependent upon 

227.79 235.25 A: them actually performing then i don't think they should bite the hand that feeds them also and it tends to actually al- also 

229.87 230.89 B: right 

235.35 236.82 A: upset the 

237.47 238.75 A: (( the [mn] fans )) 

238.76 241.59 A: ah and i think in the way that we're upset at them 

241.68 246.86 B: right and there are die hard fans that are determined 

247.02 253.45 B: to go to this game or that game because it's important to them they lose 

253.70 255.83 B: among many other people 

256.88 263.92 A: yeah but i think also with that type of situation though if um you know i think it's something that they're upset about at first 

264.27 265.91 B: right 

265.05 272.61 A: but i unlike other sorts of events um they'll get over it and it will 

271.15 273.05 B: yeah [laughter] 

272.64 282.65 A: it will just okay well it's just the way it is now and go on with life and we'll bowl as opposed to go to a game um or do something else so 

282.85 287.25 A: what i think sometimes the athletes don't realize is that [noise] you have some die hard fans but 

288.42 295.98 A: you're not a cult it's not a a following to the point where they're going to these people are just going to lay their lives out for you 

295.62 299.54 B: yes it's not a necessity by any means 

297.74 298.50 A: no 

298.89 300.16 A: no not at all 

300.19 301.17 A: (( not at all )) 

301.18 307.81 A: so with them striking and you know you'd think some of the families would get involved their families and tell them how ridiculous they're being 

308.07 310.41 A: but maybe their families are actually pushing them 

310.70 311.99 A: to make more money 

310.81 314.29 B: and are just as money hungry as they are 

313.61 314.75 A: right 

315.17 324.05 B: because they get tied into these big homes and expensive cars and jewellery and whatever else it's hard to let go 

321.72 323.00 A: exactly 

325.22 331.64 A: and you know with that i find interesting also the ones that you know there's very few athletes that are just really exceptional 

331.69 334.15 A: like the michael jordans or the um 

331.77 332.78 B: right 

334.72 337.83 A: or the whatever in baseball but 

337.86 348.87 A: you know i i think maybe a- as the pay scale i guess they do get paid more than the average but the average who might not hit a ball all season 

349.43 350.77 A: will make a million 

350.60 351.59 B: right 

350.96 353.70 A: and exactly what did you do besides nothing 

353.77 356.18 B: they are the first ones to complain 

355.93 358.12 A: exactly [noise] 

357.04 364.77 B: because you don't hear of any michael jordans or tiger woods or anybody like that complaining 

364.48 366.55 A: no they don't because they're good 

365.34 367.54 B: and they're the true stars 

367.36 369.32 A: right right 

368.57 375.05 B: you see them the newspapers have them it's all over the internet 

375.62 382.36 B: but some no name new guy will be the first one to stand up and say well this isn't fair 

383.02 384.92 B: i need more 

383.67 384.58 A: right 

385.01 386.73 B: i want more 

386.83 387.95 A: for doing 

388.28 389.08 A: nothing 

388.97 389.87 B: right 

389.38 394.00 A: hasn't hit a ball all season hasn't caught anything all season has not made a play all season 

394.32 397.49 A: and also though something else it is a season 

397.55 400.54 A: it's not a year time a a full-time job 

397.80 398.70 B: right 

401.11 406.20 A: they perform during [noise] i think two months out of the year the rest are in some kind of training camp 

406.47 408.04 B: or doing nothing 

407.69 410.86 A: or doing nothing and 

411.72 421.00 A: ah teachers who only have three months off do not get get get paid for those three months then they are the essence of our of our society so 

417.65 419.93 B: right they're left to fend 

421.81 424.87 A: i it's just i think it's very 

426.73 432.53 A: ah it just makes them look like very poor they have poor character they have poor um judgement 

432.16 433.46 B: exactly 

432.90 434.36 A: and it's just greed 

433.86 435.48 B: it is 

435.66 438.67 B: i agree one hundred per cent because 

438.72 441.14 B: i could see teachers complaining 

442.14 443.34 B: or 

443.42 449.44 B: anybody else that has to fend for themselves for this many months out of the year 

449.68 456.22 B: to make money to feed their families these other people have money handed to them and they still complain 

456.04 457.11 A: exactly 

457.31 467.39 A: i mean look at even the airline industry where the pilots mechanics and stewardess who are professionals at at and actually have a very um 

467.86 477.62 A: um specific trade that they do they took a cut in order to keep their their industry moving and keep their jobs and these 

473.93 474.96 B: right 

477.75 483.86 B: but i see that as being a devotion where a lot of these sports players fall into something 

477.90 478.88 A: people 

483.87 489.39 B: they became a high school star which moved them to being a college star 

489.06 490.06 A: mhm 

489.67 491.79 B: and all this ego 

492.55 501.17 B: it's a complete ego trip they are told you're the best in high school and may have been mediocre in college 

501.22 503.55 B: and then end up getting a pro 

504.68 507.85 B: job and then that's it 

507.55 509.65 A: and then there's nothing else for them to do 

509.49 513.95 B: right because they haven't gone to college or anything 

510.11 512.15 A: yeah or to become sports announcers 

514.55 517.10 B: they skid through college 

517.39 519.93 B: just to be able to play these sports 

519.87 526.75 A: that's right that's right and their and their skills as in writing reading mathm- mathematics is just poor 

526.88 528.72 B: oh yeah 

527.12 532.28 A: and and they have no where else to go at that point if something happens and then they have the gall 

532.30 542.13 A: to strike and ask for money when they have no other skills unlike these other professionals who have very specific skills very needed skills 

542.22 544.51 A: um are taking pay cuts 

544.33 545.35 B: right 

544.69 546.21 A: to keep their industry moving 

546.70 551.78 B: and to keep themselves going because you have to look at it from an inside 

548.49 549.40 A: yeah 

551.86 556.70 B: kind of place where you could see well if they don't have a job their families stave to death 

556.50 558.09 A: (( right and )) 

557.67 560.90 B: they lose their homes they have nothing 

561.11 564.92 B: so you take the pay cut to feed the mouths in your house 

565.82 568.35 A: i think also a lot of it has to do with the fact that 

568.40 574.42 A: ah unlike baseball if the airline industry fails business starts to fail 

574.22 575.29 B: right 

574.61 578.21 A: where you need to go to seminars and meet have meetings and such 

578.40 580.14 B: then everybody 

580.21 585.47 A: suffers for that it trickles down where if there's not a baseball game oh well 

581.36 582.33 B: right 

585.35 586.36 B: yeah 

585.75 587.85 A: yeah that's the end of that 

586.90 588.38 B: too bad 

588.15 595.58 A: yeah and all right well we'll watch seinfeld today you know it's it's it's not significant [noise] what else i 

598.06 599.90 A: had another point and i forgot about it
