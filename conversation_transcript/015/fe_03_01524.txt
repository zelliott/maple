48.84 49.70 A: yep 

49.62 56.80 B: you know that that's just crazy and there's so many other things that that money could you know do 

57.67 61.11 B: that would provide much more benefit to the rest of the world 

59.72 66.08 A: oh yeah there's there's millions and you know there's we have problems with homeless and 

65.36 66.28 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

66.27 74.93 A: people out of jobs and especially since the war time you know even though we are a war time economy it's it's you know a lot of people are struggling now 

75.16 84.59 A: and these people are making all this money they need to give back they need to stop complaining that they're not making enough and give back to to their communities 

78.32 79.36 B: mhm

89.58 90.65 B: yeah 

90.72 96.46 B: that's i mean the horrible thing is that so many of them especially it seems like in football and are 

96.61 101.53 B: doing these horrible horrible things being arrested and just being sent to jail you know 

101.64 102.57 A: yeah 

104.13 107.10 A: yeah i mean it's terrible they just 

107.19 113.84 A: you know oh well i'm i'm making ah five five million i mean there should be a cap 

113.95 117.03 A: on what professional athletes make 

116.42 117.30 B: mhm 

117.28 126.25 A: you know i'm making five million and that's not enough because i feel i'm i'm just i'm better than that let's go on strike that's just not right 

126.25 130.16 B: mhm yeah i know and for these guys to be 

130.21 141.97 B: complaining and striking when there are there are also a lot of really low paid you know relatively low paid people in the leagues as well who really suffer when these strikes go on 

142.03 143.06 A: right 

142.70 150.03 B: and it's because these high paid people don't want caps you know and it's like well you know the caps are just 

150.93 156.45 B: to keep everything in control so that there aren't people that are paid a hundred and sixty million dollars 

156.40 166.39 B: when there are people that are still in the league that are getting paid like thirty or forty thousand and they still have to when the season is over they still have to go and find something else to do 

166.37 167.41 A: right 

167.07 175.12 B: and these guys are just like whining about how or why should i put a limit on on how much i get just because 

175.36 179.29 B: other people feel its disproportionate you know it's a free market economy 

180.79 182.48 B: (( yeah [laughter] mhm mhm )) 

181.87 192.06 A: definitely definitely or you know if they decide to go on strike the professionals you know like the major leagues decide to go on strike 

192.16 194.26 A: i think they should you know 

194.80 202.98 A: have a clause on their contracts that they can't strike or if they do go on strike then they can that's cause to fire them 

203.35 210.44 A: and then they just pull up some deserving people from from the minors 

210.36 222.07 A: you know i mean there's there's guys in the minors that really have have just as good a talent if not better ha- you know most of the time who would be willing to work for chump change 

222.34 224.68 A: just because they love the game 

224.79 232.46 A: it it used to be that it was for the love of the game not for the money and now it's for the money not the love of the game 

231.93 233.29 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

232.77 235.56 A: and they need to go back to the love of the game 

235.11 236.44 B: (( yeah mhm yeah 'cause )) 

236.82 242.80 B: in essence what this is is you're getting paid huge sums of money to play a game 

242.87 244.74 A: yeah to entertain 

244.36 246.90 B: you know to play i mean ah 

247.04 249.62 B: it's it's insane 

250.10 256.84 B: and so many of these guys it seems like they don't really take it all that seriously unless you unless you pay them 

256.91 257.83 A: yeah 

257.91 266.08 B: and there's so many other people who would be like to play it just for the heck of it you know i mean look at all the little sports leagues and ah 

266.57 278.50 B: tournaments and things that happen all over the all over the country you know where people actually pay money to play in them and these guys are whining because they can't get five million more out of their deal 

278.68 280.81 A: yeah look at golf okay 

281.05 284.71 A: any time that you have to play in any golf tournament 

284.79 288.78 A: or anything you have to pay a lot of money it's expensive 

289.51 290.52 A: um 

290.72 296.85 A: even like the open they have to pay like an entry fee for this it's not free for them 

296.40 297.29 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

296.98 306.10 A: you know and and there's like you know tiger woods there's some really good golf the golf athletes they don't you don't see them going on strike 

305.79 306.75 B: (( mhm mhm mhm mhm )) 

306.54 311.88 A: i mean they 'cause they win cups and and and prize money and stuff like that 

312.03 321.15 A: that's their job that you know they're having fun but they're actually having to work for it and they have to pay an entry fee it's like 

322.10 330.23 A: i think if they had to if if a professional athlete basketball baseball football hockey if they had to actually pay 

330.26 333.84 A: a fee to be eligible for the year beside their 

334.12 336.26 A: penalties and fines for 

336.31 338.46 A: um bad behaviour 

338.90 341.60 A: then maybe things would change a little bit 

343.13 346.20 A: you know or or the fans go on strike 

345.99 358.31 B: i'm always surprised when the fans come back i mean when baseball went on strike for that long time i thought you know people would be really upset and that that baseball would suffer for a lot longer than it did 

358.61 363.94 B: especially since you i mean all the people that go and watch the games 

364.32 377.09 B: they are like your average working class blue collar people and they're the ones that really love and support these leagues and i yeah i was shocked that they would come back so soon since 

367.26 368.35 A: mhm 

377.15 378.99 B: (( you know i i would feel )) 

378.93 385.65 B: if i were going to all these games and i was a big fan of these sports you know like how was that that i'm making 

385.59 396.78 B: forty forty five thousand dollars a year and i am spending i don't know how much on season tickets and these guys were making at least you know five million a million thirty million 

396.72 408.08 B: whatever are are still whining about how they don't make enough to live because they only have one house whereas the n._b._a. have you know they're making this much and they can have three houses and 

408.74 418.63 A: yeah or i have to pay child support for my ten kids and alimony to my five wives [laughter] six wives i mean it's just ridiculous 

412.24 413.15 B: mhm 

418.76 427.52 A: like it it costs for what it costs to go to a professional game for just me and my husband 

424.45 425.25 B: (( mhm )) 

426.56 427.38 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

427.82 432.72 A: it would be the same amount if i take my whole fa- a family of four 

432.77 438.03 A: to go to disneyworld disneyland wherever and stay the night out there 

435.91 436.77 B: mhm 

437.69 438.95 B: mhm 

438.46 441.74 A: in a hotel room i mean that's that's just absurd 

441.38 442.52 B: mhm 

443.12 450.01 A: i mean that's the the ticket prices are getting high because they go on strike because they have to pay 'em more which 

450.06 453.11 A: we we get the shaft end of it [noise] 

452.27 456.86 B: yeah yeah i think the the ones to really blame 

456.93 461.98 B: are the owners who are just like hiking everything up and just charging 

462.12 468.19 B: charging an unbelievable amount for all of this you know people it's surprising how 

464.85 466.30 A: yeah 

468.45 476.58 B: how much business leaders and today's times are just like to trying to squeeze every last penny they can 

476.91 491.17 B: out of everything virtually you know like just five ten or not ten years ago because that was like but like twenty thirty years ago where it was more about business and keeping the business going and providing a service to the public 

491.24 497.29 B: and now it's just you know how can i evade taxes how can i squeeze the most out of these things 

497.35 498.47 A: (( yep )) 

498.55 509.77 B: and whenever these strikes happen the players always blame the owners and the owners always blame the players it's just stop your whining get on with what your supposed to be doing 

510.01 511.69 A: right i mean you're 

511.81 515.19 A: in a sense i mean that's you are getting paid to have fun 

514.84 516.32 B: mhm 

515.69 520.52 A: and if you don't have the heart for it and if you don't want to be there to entertain people 

521.10 522.09 A: (( ah )) 

521.75 523.01 B: there's a line 

522.14 527.50 A: if you are just there for the money you know to make massive amounts of money then 

524.17 525.07 B: mhm 

527.56 529.94 A: you you shouldn't be doing it 

529.92 533.10 B: yeah there's a line three hundred deep to get your job 

533.31 534.23 A: yep 

534.06 537.74 B: yeah if you don't want to do it for what they really want to pay you go 

538.37 541.09 B: the sad thing is the owners will pay it 

541.32 546.94 A: yeah they pay for the talent or the so called talent because there's i mean truthfully there is 

542.94 544.10 B: yeah the 

547.10 548.85 A: average joe 

548.87 550.83 A: people like you and me 

550.84 551.87 A: that 

551.98 560.80 A: most of the time are you know as talented if not better it's just they didn't go to you know college they didn't play football in college 

560.17 561.22 B: mhm 

561.11 568.91 A: or you know they tried to walk on but because somebody has had the hype and and all the prom- publicity 

569.06 572.49 A: that's why they go for 'em and that's why they pay all that money 

571.85 573.95 B: yeah i i mean what 

574.32 577.52 B: what baseball is trying to do is a little while ago 

577.50 589.84 B: was pretty admirable they were trying to cap it and distribute the money so that the teams would be more evenly spaced 'cause really at this point there are only like what four five teams that really have any chance of winning the world series 

589.81 599.89 B: because they're the teams that have the money to pay these exorbitant salaries so that the players always go to these teams and it's like why even bother with the league you
