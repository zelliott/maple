21.98 25.00 A: time i can still see all the images 

24.83 26.12 B: yeah 

25.50 27.83 A: uh in my mind and 

28.08 30.80 A: [lipsmack] i think [sigh] the m- the main thing 

31.71 34.00 A: that's changed in my life is 

32.69 33.26 B: (( [cough] )) 

35.17 36.60 A: i don't feel 

36.95 42.22 A: as safe as i did before then i never really thought that much about 

42.93 45.40 A: someone from outside our country 

46.04 47.29 A: hurting us 

47.26 48.36 B: yeah 

47.44 49.90 A: 'cause we're such a powerful nation i 

50.00 51.11 B: yeah 

50.42 60.05 A: just can't believe that that happened even to this day i mean i know it did but i just can't imagine that that was able to happen in our country 

60.10 61.56 B: yeah 

61.52 63.80 A: and [sigh] i don't really know 

64.08 67.94 A: if i fully rely on the uh security 

68.22 71.42 A: new pr- uh administrative program 

71.73 72.87 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

71.80 77.12 A: that gives us more s- [laughter] i i have my doubts about that 

77.64 79.49 A: so i guess you know 

79.94 83.30 A: it's the first time i've thought of our country being vulnerable 

83.68 84.90 B: (( [cough] yeah )) 

85.78 92.09 B: um [sigh] i kinda feel the same way um i know that i don't take for granted that there really um 

95.30 100.67 B: [lipsmack] [mn] i don't take for granted any more that that the government quite has it under control [laughter] 

100.48 101.67 A: i know 

101.27 103.43 B: um you know i kinda have to 

103.48 105.67 B: i feel like i have to watch my own back 

106.31 110.16 B: you know take care of what we need to take care of and 

110.30 111.39 B: and keep 

111.51 113.29 B: [mn] we're much more diligent 

113.93 114.89 B: at at 

114.04 117.13 A: that's what i was thinking being very observant 

116.59 118.17 B: yeah 

117.64 122.55 A: of people around us it seems like and um 

123.52 132.06 A: i i i don't tr- fly i haven't been in an airplane since this happened and um 

132.82 134.14 A: (( now e- )) 

134.15 136.50 A: now that i i'm getting so 

140.43 140.99 B: (( [cough] )) 

140.61 141.49 A: (( so )) 

141.91 145.19 A: (( i don't remember why now or not )) 

145.48 149.03 A: so my parents b- uh flew from 

149.06 155.80 A: maine down here to south carolina where i live and uh i w- at christmas and i was extremely 

151.95 152.93 B: uh-huh 

153.79 154.79 B: (( [cough] )) 

155.88 159.00 A: worried about them and coming and going 

159.12 160.09 B: yeah 

159.25 168.88 A: [lipsmack] uh you know uh i know they are taking a lot more precautions but then tonight on the news i saw where they're giving forty six pilots 

169.17 172.57 A: a gun to have in the cockpit 

172.05 174.06 B: yeah 

173.44 175.84 A: now that really scares me 

175.72 177.31 B: yeah 

176.94 184.77 A: so uh which is a whole other issue but as far as what's really changed my life more than anything 

182.42 183.54 B: (( [cough] )) 

185.27 193.07 A: after september eleventh i've really got to say that it's just i don't feel the safeness 

193.99 196.81 A: for me and my family that i once did 

196.71 197.91 B: yeah 

197.31 203.62 A: yeah i mean it's bad enough and you have to worry about people either killing you or mugging you or 

203.50 213.71 A: or trying to steal your kids or you know all that and we all everybody in the world has to worry about but uh invasion in our country that [lipsmack] 

210.16 211.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

214.18 218.61 A: it still blows my mind that that happened and all those people were lost 

218.41 226.61 B: yeah yeah it's shocking and and we are more diligent but at the same time we're still kinda the same 'cause i mean 

226.98 233.10 B: even though i don't [noise] don't think that the the you know they have as much under control as they say they do 

233.27 236.75 B: i i still feel like you know whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen 

237.48 239.86 B: you know and and 

239.10 240.48 A: well it's 

239.90 242.22 B: that's where faith takes over you know 

241.14 255.93 A: [mn] exactly i was gonna say that's the only thing that i i mean uh i'm glad we have a president that believes in god and talks about god almost every time you hear him give a speech and and i think that's so important for 

242.55 243.77 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

252.34 253.37 B: yeah 

254.53 255.31 B: (( [cough] )) 

255.89 257.42 A: uh the way 

257.61 262.17 A: people want to keep god out of everything you know certain groups 

262.50 269.97 A: um outta the school uh they want it for money and and i really feel like if we take god outta the country then 

270.59 272.84 A: we're subject to most anything 

272.47 277.27 B: yeah exactly and i feel the same way it kinda [mn] now 

278.03 290.99 B: that kinda bothers me 'cause they have all this stu- this whole thing with the under god coming out of the pledge of allegiance now is not the time you know after such a tragedy i really think that was a bad time to even consider that 

291.19 297.02 A: um i didn't see anything wrong with it being in there and if you don't believe in god then just say 

291.21 292.21 B: um 

297.35 302.29 A: what you believe in i mean it's it's america we have freedom of speech 

301.95 303.01 B: oh yeah 

302.33 310.37 A: and and so if we wanna say under god or we wanna say the ten commandments trouble is most of us who 

307.98 309.01 B: (( [cough] )) 

310.37 317.48 A: who feel strongly about this issue we're not the ones out there protesting so so many people think well 

317.83 320.99 A: you know nobody's saying don't do it let's do it 

320.92 321.97 B: yeah 

321.14 329.26 A: but it's because those of us who believe in god and and all these different things we're we're not the ones that are out there 

329.54 330.98 A: in the news 

330.63 335.70 B: yeah exactly [noise] and and it does kinda bother me especially the timing [noise] 

331.11 331.99 A: (( you know )) 

335.98 339.52 B: you know i was like now is when we need god the most 

339.61 347.78 B: you know after all these terrible things have happened that's when when we should be turning to our faith not not shying away from it 

339.69 341.33 A: exactly 

347.36 350.27 A: exactly and i was uh 

351.01 352.11 A: i was 

352.63 358.75 A: actually warmed by how much everybody helped everybody in new york 

358.48 359.65 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

359.04 368.63 A: when this thing was happening and so many heroes and and i i think about the firemen and the policemen and all the people who were 

367.25 368.27 B: (( [cough] )) 

368.57 382.65 A: there at ground zero day after day sifting through that for bones and people and uh and the toll that it's just taken on on all those people in that city um 

375.31 376.46 B: yeah 

381.98 383.54 B: yeah 

383.09 387.50 A: um my heart just goes still out to all of them and 

386.54 387.64 B: yeah 

388.37 394.21 A: [sigh] but i [mn] now on the positive side of what nine eleven has done 

394.76 398.24 A: i think it's made us appreciate 

399.84 404.76 A: the good things that we do have and that when we're put under the thumb 

404.93 407.89 A: we will band together and 

406.88 408.16 B: yeah 

408.19 411.21 A: become quite quite uh fierce 

411.59 413.66 A: (( you know um i i )) 

413.81 419.95 A: i hope they can eventually work out some system i mean there's no way to protect us a hundred percent 

419.60 421.73 B: oh no definitely not 

420.62 422.36 A: that's not gonna happen 

422.64 427.93 A: and but i think they're i think they're trying to do all that they can think of doing 

427.62 428.98 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

428.30 431.40 A: to protect us i don't know how successful they're being 

431.36 432.22 B: yeah 

431.48 432.34 A: um 

432.37 440.29 B: i'm not so sure about the guns in the cockpit thing because i mean these are these are trained trained killers [noise] that's what they do 

435.10 436.32 A: oh that 

439.30 440.14 A: they're 

440.03 443.33 A: what they're doing is train- giving these guys 

443.21 456.13 A: these courses that train them of how to fight off an attack from someone that's trying to hijack the plane or to blow the plane up and showing 'em kung fu moves and all that stuff 

455.06 455.79 B: (( [cough] )) 

456.04 467.69 A: and and my thought is well what if the gun goes off and it depressurizes the plane and i don't know i just i can't imagine all of our well all of my life i've always heard 

467.83 470.95 A: no you don't have a gun in a plane 

470.74 472.16 B: yeah 

471.54 485.81 A: because that is so dangerous so it really goes against everything that i've ever heard but now they're gonna have guns and they said the thing is it's only gonna be forty six guys right now or women there was a woman on there too 

485.55 486.70 B: mhm 

486.09 488.17 A: so you're not gonna know 

488.19 492.58 A: what plane you're flying if that pilot has the gun 

492.45 493.78 B: yeah well 

492.69 496.57 A: 'cause there's only gonna be forty six in the whole thing for right now 

496.26 510.08 B: yeah the only thing is they're coming up against terrorists you know and these terrorists they're tr- [mn] a pilot who is not used to to killing people is much more likely to hesitate 

497.06 497.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

507.40 508.51 A: mhm 

510.41 514.58 B: and they're much more likely to have [noise] be overtaken 

515.03 518.12 B: and then the gun just ends up in the terrorist's hands anyway 

518.22 521.51 B: i mean that's my fear because i mean these are people 

521.57 524.89 B: you're talking about airline pilots they don't kill people for a living 

524.98 526.34 A: that's right 

525.55 528.42 B: going up against terrorists who do [laughter] you know 

527.69 535.61 A: that's right and then with the latest thing about well i hope they screen this guy these guys as far as drinking 

528.68 529.50 B: they 

532.10 533.08 B: (( [cough] )) 

535.50 536.56 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

535.73 546.38 A: because so many pilots being found actually almost drunk and stuff i'm like oh lord now they're giving 'em guns too and so that 

542.12 543.32 B: [laughter] 

544.98 546.64 B: oh that's nice isn't it 

546.39 552.98 A: that in itself is another thing i mean it's just one more thing that makes me fearful of flying 

552.83 553.92 B: (( [cough] yeah )) 

553.50 557.82 A: uh because i'm like i don't wanna be on the plane that's got a guy with a gun 

557.95 560.36 A: um you know uh 

561.35 565.89 A: i mean i think the passengers pretty much now they'd just go ahead and jump the guy 

565.52 567.60 B: yeah no kidding 

566.11 573.18 A: [laughter] it seems to be what what the passengers are the ones that's become you know the anti terrorist movement 

572.64 573.99 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

573.39 576.53 A: and uh we just want the pilot to fly the plane 

576.18 577.73 B: yeah 

577.29 579.37 A: get us down safe 

578.92 581.48 B: yeah concentrate on your job 

579.40 580.47 A: but uh 

581.10 582.63 A: exactly 

582.74 586.06 A: but uh i i i think 

582.96 583.82 B: (( but )) 

586.30 587.82 A: that people 

588.15 590.05 A: after nine eleven 

590.58 598.64 A: everybody i have talked to and i mean every single person that i have talked with over the last year and a half two years 

593.86 594.77 B: mhm 

598.92 599.89 A: uh
