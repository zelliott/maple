120.74 121.54 A: they 

122.56 123.34 A: (( have )) 

133.85 146.90 B: is um aren't thinking about education so much they're they're looking at it as a and although ther- it is a lot of kids that are that are poor that are coming up in sports and that's that's their meal ticket i just think it's in the long run it just affects the game very badly

173.15 187.30 B: i think it should be a clause like in a contract that if you make just like you have the capped clause i think there should be a clause if you make over a certain amount of money and make it lower enough where it can represent most of the players you can't strike [laughter] 

187.19 189.73 A: (( oh they make very little money they get you know ))

227.59 230.59 A: (( working year round like other players )) 

230.13 242.20 B: but you know you know who else it hurts though for instance um like for instance the average i i had found out a few years ago and maybe it's a little higher now but i found out that the average m._b._a. like m._b._a. 

242.08 247.33 B: doesn't make millions the average m._b._a. player between like ninety and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars

259.24 259.95 A: not 

263.53 269.06 B: without money he he's hurting he's on the same team with you but but he's hurting and you're fine

316.11 317.52 B: really 

317.54 324.06 B: so so so when so when there's when there's uh a strike in the major league that means the minor leagues has to strike too

354.30 355.34 B: (( and )) 

355.65 361.15 A: yeah i know we were just up in uh buffalo new york and went to the minor league team 

356.01 356.87 B: (( then )) 

361.24 368.86 A: uh place there and they had a beautiful stadium [laughter] oh it was gorgeous we have one for the twins right here in fort wayne 

368.93 375.16 A: but it you know thank god they didn't go out on strike but it's you know that the- 

375.29 378.91 A: [mn] it's just it affects just some it affects advertising 

378.67 380.29 B: mhm oh yeah definitely 

379.18 381.80 A: it affects the people that work that in the stadium 

381.46 383.09 B: mhm oh yes 

381.84 392.83 A: it affects the community because people come from out of town to see their favorite teams and they have to stay in motels they have to eat in restaurants they shop in malls 

387.66 389.01 B: mhm 

392.91 394.27 A: the the 

394.44 398.68 A: the total span of who it affects is unreal 

398.21 399.63 B: mhm 

399.03 408.91 A: and it affects the families of these people because hey the people aren't coming in so they get laid off of work it's you know it's just like any other business except it's 

409.38 413.77 A: really on a on a much bigger scale 'cause it's nationwide 

412.71 418.72 B: yeah i guess i never thought about it that way you know i'm thinking of just the players but yeah you're right it does affect the businesses as well 

418.42 420.13 A: it affects a lot of people 

419.81 431.15 B: yeah you you it might be like a guy that that depends on a particular season because he's open for that particular season for that particular reason now there's a strike and he can't make yeah that's right 

430.60 431.70 A: yep 

431.11 435.55 B: that is right [mn] and then i guess it causes ticket prices to go up too 

435.47 443.16 A: well ticket prices as far as i'm concerned are ridiculous anyway but you know we don't have to pay we're lucky we don't have to pay for 'em but [laughter] um 

435.57 437.06 B: when when the strike 

438.42 439.55 B: oh yes 

441.98 442.84 B: yeah 

443.25 447.55 A: [mn] uh it's it's uh an average family 

448.01 449.30 A: can't afford 

449.78 451.18 A: (( to go to a game )) 

450.72 453.21 B: tell me about it tell me about 

452.13 458.71 A: you take four people to a game and you know forty or fifty dollars a ticket it depends upon who 

457.65 463.55 B: you really think they really need that that money or do you think they they they raised the prices just for profit 

461.10 471.72 A: i think some of the stadiums do some of the stadiums do some of the stadiums uh you're talking like the new york yankees can you imagine the upkeep the security 

469.30 470.44 B: mhm 

471.78 472.77 A: uh 

472.96 476.08 A: what it costs to keep that stadium up and running uh uh 

477.11 484.14 A: it you know it's just people don't think about you know the grass you know there's a lot of upkeep 

481.44 482.48 B: yeah 

484.17 488.10 B: well you're very knowledgeable wow [laughter] you could be in that business 

487.72 491.96 A: but well like i said we've got a family member that is in the business 

491.28 494.30 B: so so so you get the the inside scoop into 

492.47 497.33 A: [laughter] i mean both phone calls i this is my this is just this is my second phone call 

497.07 498.07 B: okay 

497.68 500.07 A: so i've have you had any before yet 

499.48 503.42 B: oh yeah this is i think this is my i think third phone call 

502.84 511.84 A: okay they're pretty cool i did- i didn't know how i'd like it or not but boy and everyone of 'em so far both of them kind of like around sports so 

511.25 524.59 B: well you know you get to you get to talk to some very nice people and and in my my case in this in this case uh you get an education you know you you caused me to think about some things uh concerning the strike that i'd never thought about it i always thought about the players but never 

524.38 531.05 B: i never really thought about uh the businesses that it affects and how it affects people and how it affects people on the on the personal levels 

529.83 543.29 A: well and do you ever stop to think that this could be uh the end of a player's career this could've been his very hottest year and because of something that occurred and they had no pre- no choice but to strike or whatever 

534.89 535.87 B: yeah 

542.84 544.09 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

543.54 544.52 A: uh 

544.81 552.45 A: he may he might have been another babe ruth he might've been you know we don't know or he might have been nothing he might have busted out 

547.28 548.08 B: (( yes )) 

549.21 550.20 B: that's right 

551.96 553.18 B: yeah 

552.54 557.26 A: but there's there's a whole year out of these guys careers and their careers are not that long 

557.12 558.49 B: yeah that's true 

558.04 564.73 A: you know somebody says oh well they made a million and a half year well if they have a total debilitating injury 

564.26 565.70 B: mhm 

565.22 569.25 A: a million and a half for one year of play which this happens 

569.07 570.22 B: mhm 

570.71 571.51 B: yeah 

570.89 573.14 A: for an injury and be gone 

573.22 574.71 A: that's not a lot of money 

574.41 576.61 B: mhm i know 

575.70 581.19 A: if that's all they play and all they make they can't live on that for the rest of their lives 

580.56 585.46 B: then they've got mortgages and children to take [laughter] care of yeah 

581.96 583.36 A: that's right 

584.56 587.61 A: and it's a career that they've worked years to get to 

587.11 588.89 B: mhm 

588.35 592.84 A: so and some of them weren't smart enough to go ahead and finish their college education 

592.70 593.93 B: yeah right 

594.22 599.56 A: so here they are they don't have a college degree to fall back on and things like that 

597.78 598.68 B: mhm 

599.06 599.95 B: yeah
