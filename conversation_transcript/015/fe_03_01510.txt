219.50 220.12 B: (( no )) 

221.82 227.40 A: there are people still today that actually think the way we have in the past it's like 

227.88 241.59 A: like and during the holocaust or whatever people you know it was because the jews were da da de dah you know everyone dislike the jews because they jewish i mean i'm glad that u._s. hasn't been thinking that because

242.79 244.87 A: [laughter] 

244.05 247.34 B: (( well i don't i'd say i don't think )) 

247.35 256.99 B: uh i'm not talking about the young generatio- i mean i'm just saying that i'm just more aware of just certain 

257.87 262.74 B: i'm just well i'll just say this i'm aware of certain people that i 

262.85 266.26 B: see in particular settings that i have not seen 

266.38 269.74 B: in a certain setting before and 

270.79 279.86 B: um see i'm not i'm not in college and it's different because it's it's it's it's a race bound you know you see every culture 

270.88 272.04 A: wow 

279.81 290.34 B: but if you go in a different setting and you see a certain class of people you are gonna tend to look around you know you are gonna tend to say 

280.12 281.35 A: (( yeah i speak )) 

287.90 288.81 A: uh-huh 

290.52 298.61 B: why are these people here in a group or something you know what i mean i mean i'm not saying that it it's not bad 

295.17 296.11 A: (( mhm )) 

298.63 303.57 B: or anything but you're more just aware of things as happening now you have to be 

299.18 300.62 A: (( mhm )) 

303.60 309.66 A: so basically what you're saying is the changes that you've made is being more aware of security 

308.89 311.90 B: yeah more awareness of my surroundings 

312.29 313.01 A: okay 

312.40 313.77 B: it just 

314.30 315.59 B: (( and like )) 

315.81 316.85 A: well like 

315.98 317.35 B: i well i 

317.48 318.45 B: (( go ahead it )) 

317.78 318.70 A: okay 

318.84 321.46 A: oh okay [laughter] well me like 

321.49 323.25 A: i personally 

324.47 332.38 A: rather than being more aware of what my surroundings yeah i am but i tend to focus more on after nine eleven i tend to focus more on 

333.14 338.97 A: how much i spend my spending my expenditure and everything like that how much i spend day in and day out 

338.90 348.71 A: that's what i'm more worried about because my biggest concern is our money at right now and it it's so hard to get a job it's so hard 

348.00 349.28 B: is 

348.91 352.10 A: yeah yeah exactly and so 

351.20 353.40 B: (( it really is yeah )) 

352.71 354.69 A: but that's why that's 

354.77 360.09 A: my only concern i mean being aware there's gonna be things that will go on 

360.57 363.37 A: every day and we can't stop it you know 

363.53 365.02 A: but um 

365.20 366.55 A: i mean yeah 

365.31 376.94 B: okay but just think about this you can be working right now and it could be a terrorist attack that goes on you right now because it's just more rampantly now you could go the greyhound 

377.41 390.35 B: on the greyhound bus and somebody can just attack you i mean these things can happen but it's just more rampantly now than ever before because this is how they attack they attack through the postal office 

390.51 397.47 B: they just attack certain places where you would you wouldn't expect they would before but now they do 

391.16 391.92 A: (( [mn] )) 

397.87 402.17 B: and it's gonna get to the point where it's probably gonna be home invasion 

398.09 399.10 A: right 

403.36 405.15 A: oh really that'd be 

404.66 410.37 B: um that's my biggest fear i hope it doesn't get to that point where it be home invasions that they do 

411.52 412.26 A: (( wow )) 

412.42 415.47 A: man i wasn't even there is no way 

414.37 426.66 B: you know you gotta think you see the way they think is the way people don't think so you gotta think like how they think what think very small minded you know they don't think real big minded they 

427.04 429.60 B: think real small you know 

429.87 432.22 A: well i honestly think that um 

432.98 437.54 A: they get more like a mass amount of people 

438.01 439.11 A: other than 

439.28 445.20 A: like ruining single family homes you know do you get what i'm saying like as a whole 

443.56 453.61 B: right and i don't mean with i mean i don't mean like home in- i mean like where they will attack a community not just single out a home and just run up in it 

450.60 451.56 A: okay 

453.41 459.45 B: but they will just invade a uh like a community setting do you understand what i mean 

453.79 454.92 A: (( right )) 

459.37 462.66 A: yes like those whole rumors on um 

459.63 460.66 B: (( just )) 

462.78 471.67 A: being attacked at the mall and etcetera yeah i i didn't really buy into that at all did you 

465.75 468.14 B: right yeah 

471.39 473.21 B: (( no i didn't )) 

472.64 476.72 A: yeah so it was like i don't know it's just 

477.39 479.83 A: it's difficult to say 'cause i don't 

479.97 483.96 A: yeah i'd i'd rather be aware but not live in fear 

483.72 486.64 B: right you can't ever live in fear 'cause you can't live 

486.03 486.59 A: (( yeah )) 

487.25 492.68 B: but you just gotta be aware always be aware of your surroundings and plus 

492.82 503.10 B: the biggest fear too is economy and it's just everything and you don't want it to get to where you're being educated you're scared to be around certain races it's just not fair to them 

503.50 504.48 B: you know 

504.94 505.97 A: did you like 

505.00 509.60 B: (( but on the other hand we're happy with the um )) 

509.79 515.15 B: nasa when the aircraft went dow- i mean that's an aircraft 

515.84 519.78 B: um you never talk about the thing that exploded in texas 

519.42 522.50 A: yeah yeah right right and uh in fort worth 

520.78 523.34 B: okay and there was one 

524.88 527.91 B: i think he was a israelite israel 

527.94 535.18 B: man and i mean you've got to question these kind of things because they do die for their cause you know they really do 

535.33 538.67 B: and they now get more educated than ever to 

539.93 543.80 B: befriend americans and to do these kind of things 

543.93 545.00 A: mhm 

544.89 551.28 B: so these things you gotta be more aware of not everybody of course of this race is doing anything but 

551.92 553.79 B: some are and some aren't 

554.26 562.00 A: so like did you did you make any changes in like benevolence like did you go out into the community and help people out after nine eleven 

554.40 555.37 B: (( you know )) 

562.13 563.49 B: (( um )) 

564.07 565.18 A: 'cause um 

564.19 566.84 B: i i just became more 

568.17 570.22 B: it's like if somebody 

569.34 570.21 A: cautious 

570.82 584.55 B: it's like if somebody you know their past that somebody was your loved one you just become more caring more sensitive and more loving towards everybody 'cause you've become you're just know 

581.66 582.79 A: oh 

585.23 593.41 B: you're taking it personal now because you know it just could happen to you now it could have been your family you know it just could have been anybody
