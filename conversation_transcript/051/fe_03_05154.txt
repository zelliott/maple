151.27 152.19 A: yeah 

152.05 157.65 B: you know i get along with my family really well i mean i've never really had any major problems with them um 

157.92 163.60 B: you know i'm sure i did some things as a kid that probably drove my parents crazy and as i grew up ah 

163.65 169.22 B: was in high school and borrowed the car probably ah you know had my parents worried a couple of times but 

168.43 170.47 A: curfews and all that stuff 

169.84 174.87 B: yeah exactly i mean it's not like i was looking to be a delinquent it's just you know like in part of growing up 

174.51 176.13 A: mhm if 

175.28 181.60 B: part of growing up um you know one day i hope to have a family of my own you know get married and have kids and 

181.57 184.48 A: you want to instill family type of values 

181.71 182.71 B: you know if i 

184.39 186.95 B: i- i- if i could be anything 

187.41 194.40 B: like the way my dad is and how he's raised me and my brother and my sister and been great to my mom you know 

194.43 197.75 B: you know i'll be very satisfied and happy with that 

196.79 200.00 A: just try and em- kind of emulate what they did 

199.43 203.12 B: y- yeah i mean 'cause they've just been great you know i mean 

204.00 208.51 B: i i i mean they they just have great values you know they 

208.61 214.03 B: they accept everybody they're friendly um not smokers not drinkers 

214.09 218.94 A: yeah that's good they've always been open with like friends and girlfriends and all that 

214.15 215.63 B: you know i mean 

217.69 221.53 B: yeah oh y- well i unfortunately i really haven't had 

221.62 225.77 B: you know a whole lot of relationships with women but you know my friends you know 

226.37 229.42 B: yeah they've never had any problems with that 

228.85 238.49 A: yeah yeah that's good well you sound like you have a good family 'cause with me my my ah gra- my grandparents were were most of the time there for me more than my parents 

231.55 232.58 B: yeah i 

238.31 239.25 B: okay 

238.77 251.59 A: so that's like a a great example of how like it's hard to define like family you know because a lot of people would ah assume that that's just mother and father but sometimes like especially in today's day and age 

251.42 259.53 A: if sometimes parents have too many problems ah and ah other family members or friends take over the normal responsibilities you know 

259.39 262.37 B: you know i was a teacher in a school district in philadelphia 

262.63 268.10 B: for a while and one of the things that i found very interesting is that a lot of these kids 

268.42 272.16 B: in the um inner city schools they have to work 

272.55 278.44 B: until like twelve one o'clock in the morning just to put food on the table maybe for their little brother or sister or 

278.60 288.00 B: food on the table for themselves and you know yeah in high school and you know even you look at like a lot of families you know 

280.39 281.35 A: mhm 

281.41 283.13 A: in high school right 

287.97 300.90 B: both parents work nowadays and you know it really leads you to the situation of you know you're seven years old and coming home from school and you know mum or dad are not home to like go over homework with you or discipline you or just make you a sandwich you know 

300.82 303.40 B: how's your day and read to you you know 

303.54 308.80 A: yeah that that sounds like yeah i mean th- that sounds like kind of like i didn't really have that too much 

303.76 304.54 B: you 

308.83 310.74 B: yeah i okay i 

309.45 319.83 A: 'cause i i i was raised by my mother but she was like one of these single mothers you know had exactly so so i was like a latch key kid you know what that you've heard of that right 

313.99 315.40 B: who had to work 

317.84 318.72 B: okay 

319.26 321.41 B: um 

320.13 323.75 A: it's just like you go home and you basically take care of yourself 'til they you know 

323.93 326.71 A: 'til your mother gets home late at night things like that 

326.13 328.20 B: yeah and and you know i mean 

328.74 335.51 B: you know it's a very unfortunate situation you know i mean i mean that isn't family i mean it's kind of you know survival of the fittest 

335.15 336.94 A: yeah yeah exactly 

335.52 338.29 B: and it would be nice if you know 

338.61 353.57 B: kids get home come home from school if they need help with home work the parents could be there and help them with it but you know unfortunately you know parents have to work you know one two jobs three jobs sometimes just to put food on the plate college costs are tremendously exorbitant 

352.92 354.55 A: yeah this is true 

353.59 360.20 B: it's ridiculous i mean you know clothing is pricey c- cars are pricey 

357.31 369.13 A: [mn] yeah exactly i don't know how some people do it especially like the county w- i live in westchester county you know there's there's poverty too but it's it's one of the wealthiest counties in the country and ah 

368.37 369.44 B: oh sure 

369.36 382.52 A: and and i don't know how some people do it i mean i'm just a single guy um generally i've like a small studio but just when i observe and see people like five six cars and just you know just clothes and everything i i i 

382.33 392.20 A: literally don't know what jobs they have that they can actually y- you know what i mean like i don't i don't i just don't know like the mathematically how they can do it 

391.81 395.75 B: [laughter] yeah i mean i'm sure they're not making ah all that money off these phone surveys 

395.54 397.93 A: [laughter] exactly 

395.82 396.91 B: that's for sure 

397.34 399.92 B: um do you live anywhere near duchess county

445.22 447.79 A: oh you why you've done it right 

447.10 452.88 B: well i was a math teacher in the school district of philadelphia and i was a substitute teacher and it was just brutal 

452.30 454.63 A: well w- what like high school 

454.17 455.36 B: high school yes 

454.73 461.31 A: oh yeah i could see that being brutal so i i kind of started with the younger kids so i'm k. right now i'm k. two five 

458.92 459.75 B: okay 

461.01 463.68 B: oh cool i i- i- it's night and day 

461.56 462.47 A: yeah 

463.46 468.03 A: oh okay yeah i could tell that yeah i i didn't want to jump right in to that 

463.69 464.89 B: night and day 

467.41 479.39 B: well all it's going to take is one day when you're sick and these k. two five kids want everything from you and you'll know why it's better to do high school the reason i oh yeah at least in a high school you can turn around and you're like look 

475.41 476.35 A: yeah 

479.41 485.94 B: you know i'm not feeling well you know we're kind of a family here you know give me a break today and high school kids 

483.28 491.73 A: yeah yeah well we the kids the kids expect you to kind of you know to be an adult and yeah i know what you mean it's different 

490.50 496.97 B: yeah i mean at least you can reason with a high school student kids seven years old you can't reason with them 'cause you don't expect them to reason 

495.24 498.04 A: yeah exactly exactly 

497.28 500.92 B: you know um but getting back to the whole family thing um 

501.55 507.64 B: you know i think it's important to have good relationships with ah as many people as you can in your immediate family 

507.22 508.34 A: mhm 

507.71 512.61 B: and you know to try to make as many friendships as you can without spreading yourself too thin 

512.33 513.60 A: yeah 

512.97 516.51 B: you know ah honesty's important you know 

515.47 527.94 A: i'm around your age a- and ah i'm trying to kind of figure out where i'm going to be at you know if if and when i get married and have kids it's kind of hard 'cause i don't have that that that kind of pattern to emulate 

528.11 529.70 A: really that much 

529.53 543.55 A: so besides basic values and and things like that it's going to be a little bit harder for me and i think to just i mean i don't know i guess common sense comes into it but but just just the kind of routine and things like that i'm not i'm not really used to you know 

529.80 531.55 B: um 

542.97 549.26 B: i i think being yourself will probably be the first thing be true to yourself you know don't try to be somebody 

549.12 559.96 B: that you see on t. v. or out of a magazine you know you know you yourself the best sounds to me like if you can emulate your grandparents because from what you said they were the ones who pretty much raised you 

551.25 552.92 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

559.50 560.80 A: that's true yeah 

560.18 568.52 B: you know that'd probably be a step in the right w- direction as well and i'm sure that you know if and when you get married you know your wife will have 

568.63 578.75 B: you know some values as well and i'm sure that she'll be able you know hopefully the person you marry you know have parents who were you know pretty good to her and you know 

570.00 572.46 A: yeah that's true that's true yeah [noise] 

577.32 579.99 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

579.40 581.48 B: you know use that combination 

581.18 583.66 A: yeah there's no there's no handbook you know 

581.53 582.59 B: you know ah 

583.80 594.61 B: no there really isn't there really isn't um you know i don't have any kids so i can't really talk about you know what stages these kids go through but as a high school teacher you know i kind of know 

584.90 586.25 A: yeah 

594.92 599.89 B: you know they do go different phases one day they'll love you next day they want to kill you and then 

599.39 599.89 A: (( [laughter] ))
