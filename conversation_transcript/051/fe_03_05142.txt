8.11 10.20 B: what's the topic education 

10.88 15.94 A: yeah it's education and how computers affect it or 

14.99 18.15 B: okay um i think computers are good for it 

19.61 21.93 A: yeah well i agree um 

22.40 28.49 A: that in some ways they're they're good for it yes ah but there may be some drawbacks so 

28.97 30.23 B: [mn] like what 

29.30 33.14 A: when when ah and overuse like um 

33.91 37.94 A: [lipsmack] socialization skills may not be developed if ah 

38.24 43.09 A: too much dependence is put on computers for the learning 

43.19 44.07 A: for per- 

43.20 44.92 B: i agree with that 

44.25 47.54 A: a young person's learning at least especially 

47.00 48.87 B: i agree with that ah 

49.14 51.08 B: i also think that ah 

51.94 54.45 B: [lipsmack] you know computers there's a lot of things you know 

54.75 57.25 B: you can do to cheat on computers you know 

57.56 64.79 B: like ah like punctuation and stuff a lot of computers will put that in for you i i think that kind of you know hurts kids who learn 

65.13 66.88 B: you know trying to teach them you know 

66.45 68.59 A: yeah yeah that's a g- 

68.61 71.95 A: that's a point there although um [lipsmack] 

73.52 77.81 A: with the [mn] if you program the lessons so that ah 

77.90 80.93 A: to test for the use of such things that could 

80.92 82.47 B: well that's true 

81.53 84.88 A: that's a way to ah fix that problem 

84.42 85.51 B: that's true 

86.36 88.27 B: [lipsmack] well um 

89.28 89.99 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

90.27 93.12 B: [sigh] this is not my strong topic [laughter] 

91.35 93.28 A: and of course you know ah 

93.61 97.22 A: w- ways that it's good i suppose are that ah 

98.17 102.02 A: it it provides more ways ah 

102.40 105.55 A: to administer to different people's ah 

106.41 107.44 A: um 

108.48 109.12 A: w- 

109.46 111.65 A: ah different people's learning 

111.73 112.53 B: (( [noise] uh )) 

112.02 114.66 A: i mean you know different people learn by 

115.03 118.98 A: ah different parameters and so there's more options available by 

119.15 121.35 A: adding that element 

122.13 128.07 B: that's a good point that's that's a good point um i can't really disagree with that um 

122.35 123.47 A: (( so mhm )) 

128.46 134.43 B: [lipsmack] i think they're good but like like you said there's a lot of drawbacks um besides that um 

134.87 136.71 B: [lipsmack] perso- um 

137.18 139.74 B: i can't think of the word i'm trying to think of here 

141.13 142.56 B: (( ah [lipsmack] )) 

142.85 146.17 B: [sigh] ah i i think it takes away from one on one learning 

146.45 147.58 B: you know what i mean 

147.71 148.52 A: uh-huh 

149.03 149.66 B: (( ah )) 

150.53 156.49 B: i think that can hurt a kid in the future but i think they're good because you know more and more things are getting ah 

156.81 161.03 B: you know computers are being used i mean you need a computer to do anything you know 

161.03 161.83 A: uh-huh 

161.14 162.69 B: it's good that ah 

163.95 166.49 B: [noise] ah it's a good thing you know to be familiar with them 

166.84 171.64 A: yeah yeah so like like a lot of things ah 

171.88 174.33 A: if it's used in proper measure then 

174.67 176.00 A: it can ah 

176.65 179.13 A: then it's an asset to a person's ah 

179.27 180.64 B: mm i agree 

179.71 182.50 A: well in in this case to education 

183.01 190.34 A: so it should be used wisely and administered wisely and so um 

190.72 194.02 A: [lipsmack] if it's an added feature in a person's education 

194.91 196.98 A: then it can help but ah 

197.01 198.36 A: it shouldn't ah 

199.39 203.66 A: just it has to be used and to the proper extent 

203.76 205.53 A: (( well like ah yeah )) 

206.81 207.80 B: i agree 

208.10 209.90 B: i i think you're right 

211.17 212.32 B: (( [noise] ah [noise] [noise] )) 

211.27 212.77 A: and actually ah 

212.78 213.73 A: even though 

214.08 219.52 A: overuse might hinder socialization skills on the other hand there are 

219.56 230.14 A: socialization skills involved in some commun- computer communications so it can actually enhance it when it's used in to the right extent 

229.38 233.26 B: really i never ah i sell computers personally 

232.93 233.75 A: do you 

233.33 235.73 B: um and i never ah 

236.10 241.58 B: i really don't understand how using a computer can help ah can help a kid you know socialize 

242.23 244.37 A: well because d- um 

245.02 249.32 A: a- an in a literary manner like 

249.38 256.00 A: by emailing and chatting you know they're communica- there's that's another avenue of 

256.12 258.10 A: communication that they can 

258.70 261.50 A: that might ah stimulate their learning 

260.55 261.25 B: (( all )) 

262.10 262.97 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

262.22 263.93 A: and 

264.20 265.19 A: (( ah )) 

265.68 267.93 A: just like writing letters although 

268.36 270.38 A: emailing and and ah 

270.82 274.00 A: chatting is is quicker than writing letters so it's 

274.75 277.53 A: it might be even more stimulating than 

278.24 280.60 A: than correspondence through letter writing 

281.40 285.05 B: well that that's that's all true but ah 

285.44 298.72 B: like as far as chatting and stuff like that ah on computers um as far as that goes with education i mean i don't know if too many ah teachers that let kids go into chat rooms and stuff like that 

288.06 288.89 A: yeah 

298.80 299.91 B: you know what i mean 

300.87 302.88 A: well maybe not ah 

303.71 309.67 A: an in the classroom as a formal means of education but ah i mean informally 

309.85 311.25 A: it may ah 

311.57 314.22 A: increase some communication skills 

314.55 315.77 B: hm 

315.49 316.85 A: just like ah 

319.34 320.91 A: (( informally ah )) 

322.53 331.98 A: communication skills may be and in one respect are enhanced by letter writing and like i was saying email and chatting 

331.15 333.23 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

333.19 334.12 A: um 

334.49 339.16 A: also i think and like i say you know it has to be done 

339.77 341.87 A: to the right amount of um 

340.82 342.08 B: properly 

341.92 344.25 A: (( yeah a- )) 

344.85 348.87 A: and like with many things ah as far as education goes ah 

349.62 353.17 A: for you need ah an adult supervision 

354.33 357.12 A: at least or at least monitoring to ah 

359.06 361.56 A: to see that things are do- you know um 

362.70 365.00 A: are going to the benefit of the child 

364.75 366.05 B: (( [noise] hm )) 

366.45 371.13 B: [noise] [lipsmack] that's true ah i'm kind of like in the middle in between this ah 

369.72 370.70 A: yeah 

371.66 378.77 B: i personally i think that ah computers as far as education typing typing a paper 

378.82 389.46 B: some things are i think that's useful but as far as anything else i i don't know you know i really don't think it's that useful see i'm kind of in the middle here 

378.93 379.69 A: uh-huh 

381.12 381.95 A: yeah 

390.11 391.96 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

391.35 392.54 B: (( [noise] ah )) 

392.24 395.49 A: of course i'm i'm speculating myself but ah 

396.95 399.24 A: (( you know i'm just suspecting that ah )) 

401.00 402.33 A: if you can 

402.93 405.11 A: if you can encourage ah 

405.18 406.94 A: a child to communicate 

407.43 410.62 A: then the more avenues he for communication 

410.93 412.25 A: then the more 

412.27 413.75 A: chance there is 

414.37 415.99 A: for them to develop 

415.89 417.37 B: (( [noise] hm )) 

416.28 419.41 A: and that may be true for adults as well as children 

419.38 421.20 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] that's true )) 

422.15 423.19 B: (( [noise] ah )) 

424.44 428.27 B: computers and education i'm running out of things to say about this um 

430.53 433.40 A: and um as far as though 

435.51 437.80 A: when you consider adults you know 

438.80 442.91 A: ah there's many ah ways you can learn from computers that ah 

444.00 445.71 A: may make it ah 

447.00 450.38 A: ca- can help you fit into a a busy schedule 

450.31 452.01 B: right right um 

452.22 455.38 B: one thing one thing i like about computers is ah 

455.56 459.27 B: nowadays they have those online classes get your degree on line 

459.31 460.24 A: yeah 

459.48 468.43 B: you know that helps a lot of ah that helps a lot of mothers you know at home taking care of their kids and trying to further their education that that i think that's a wonderful thing 

465.09 466.20 A: yeah 

468.13 473.86 A: uh-huh plus you have ah c. b. t. computer based training on c._d.s or 

468.57 469.68 B: (( but ah )) 

473.96 475.29 A: or d._v._d. 

474.71 478.95 B: right you can you can learn foreign languages right [laughter] right on your computer 

475.67 476.23 A: (( [mn] )) 

477.73 478.62 A: yeah 

479.45 483.82 A: yeah plus there's interactive ah programs for things like that 

482.81 484.53 B: yeah 

484.62 490.39 B: that's true i mean i i th- i think it's i think i think the computer and education is great in that way 

490.50 496.24 B: i just but at a high school level i i don't know i'm a little bit sceptical about it 

490.54 491.32 A: uh-huh 

498.12 500.90 A: yeah well i you know 

501.76 504.97 A: i think the concern is that they're going to become 

505.73 507.60 A: lazy about ah 

508.12 519.88 A: human or interaction that's the danger but i think ah to give them the proper dose of it at different st- you know ah different stages of their development ah 

510.08 511.62 B: [sigh] mm that's 

520.33 523.76 A: helps them prepare for fully utilizing 

523.89 526.82 A: the tool that a computer is when they're adults 

527.10 528.75 B: (( [noise] hm )) 

529.67 533.01 B: (( [lipsmack] well um [sigh] )) 

534.25 537.37 A: and of course in order to make sure they're getting 

537.96 541.80 A: the right amount not overuse ah that requires ah 

542.74 549.42 A: interaction with adult educators to mix a- and adu- and parents yeah 

545.33 546.85 B: mm teachers 

548.38 548.98 B: (( yeah )) 

549.03 551.80 B: well see see i don't know because 

552.40 558.02 B: [noise] see ano- another point i could bring up is you know i mean kids nowadays especially at the high school level 

557.86 570.99 B: you know a lot of 'em ah at least wh- in the area i'm in you know a lot of 'em aren't outside playing i mean they all have all that computer stuff in the house they have the computers or the c- game systems that are pretty much computer 

557.98 558.73 A: yeah 

566.40 567.29 A: yeah 

571.04 579.13 B: computer generated stuff you know that makes them kind of lazy and we got a bunch of lazy little fat kids you know nobody's going out and doing anything anymore 

573.11 573.97 A: uh-huh 

579.03 586.08 B: and i th- i think if you bring that into a school as well and make it a a big part of ah 

586.71 596.31 B: their education i think you're definitely going to have a bunch a bunch a lazy lazy kids [noise] who can't interact with one another [noise] [noise] 

592.18 594.29 A: yeah well that's definitely 

594.96 598.57 A: that's definitely ah a danger and maybe a 

598.99 599.89 A: (( maybe is a pr- ))
