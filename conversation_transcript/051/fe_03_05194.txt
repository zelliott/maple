102.92 109.70 B: [laughter] [laughter] i i see your point that's a that's a good w- way of looking at it too but ah 

109.94 112.93 B: the particular places i go to [lipsmack] 

113.25 124.37 B: they're pretty reputable and i know the parties that prepare the food and i've been going there for a while so i i somewhat trust them 

123.78 127.90 A: well then y- you got a good good rap- rapport with them 

128.23 131.59 A: ah you go into some of these restaurants and all you know is ah 

132.45 138.23 A: they go behind the doors and say that here's your order and next you know your food's popping up behind the door

171.16 172.38 B: and ah 

173.00 178.04 B: some of 'em they try to say it's barbecue but it's more like grilled 

178.29 187.50 B: food 'cause you don't get that smoked flavor at all in it and a lot of times they bring it to you and it's it's all that fat on there 

179.19 180.47 A: oh yes 

187.17 188.66 A: mhm 

188.11 199.96 B: and ah half cooked that's to give it the reddish color which they say is from smoking and we- i really don't care to eat pork if it's not made 

200.76 206.03 B: just right and ah because they say it's safe now 

206.43 216.11 B: but years ago there used to be some kind of small worm or something that you were able to get if you ate pork raw or undercooked i don't remember what it was called 

216.11 224.08 A: [noise] ah [mn] i'm not really sure what it's called now either was well [mn] like a salmonella or something like that

230.43 230.99 A: (( [mn] ))

240.22 248.47 B: ah were on a farm and they slaughtered their own food and they didn't follow ah the instructions 

244.66 246.07 A: (( mhm [noise] ))

257.26 258.94 B: (( [mn] and ah ))

303.32 305.14 B: (( [noise] do )) 

305.22 310.43 B: you give it a rub or anything before that do you make you rub it give it a rub 

307.46 308.37 A: a what 

310.98 319.71 B: you know do you put anything out a powder on it prior to ah preparing it do you put on something like a little bit of chili powder on it and ah 

320.01 324.00 B: [lipsmack] mix a little flour with it and then throw it up on the 

320.05 321.00 A: i 

324.57 327.41 A: no not always ah 

327.05 331.86 B: for marination purposes you know [mn] [noise] 

328.97 330.55 A: (( right ah )) 

331.01 334.60 A: well my wife does the marinating a lot of the times but ah 

334.98 339.88 A: and then o- of course it's my job to cook 'em on the grill but you know how that goes 

339.43 341.14 B: yeah i know how that goes 

340.35 342.22 A: [laughter] 

342.02 344.15 B: (( [mn] ah sometimes ah )) 

345.14 350.04 B: it just doesn't go exactly the way you want either 'cause [laughter] 

347.74 350.43 A: oh i agree i agree 

350.34 353.80 B: ah 'cause my wife usually has me doing two things at once 

353.78 354.77 A: oh yes 

355.64 358.41 A: (( and ah you're )) 

357.60 359.44 B: that's another reason why ah 

359.49 361.06 A: you'd prefer to eat [laughter] 

359.92 374.45 B: i prefer going [laughter] to the restaurant compared to [laughter] eating at home because at the restaurant they don't ask me to cut their grass while [laughter] while i'm prepari- while the food's being prepared or pick up ah ah some of the weeds or things in the yard or 

374.25 377.64 B: do some other particular chore that might be in the yard [mn] 

377.51 379.83 A: oh i agree 

381.35 383.36 A: but i i love the 

384.08 392.15 A: i don't know i like you know the grill's on the back porch sit out there in the back porch and grill away and 

392.32 395.04 A: drink a nice cold one while you're at it 

392.76 394.87 B: (( [noise] )) 

395.59 405.64 B: well ah i would say in comparison between going out and staying at home i would say about twenty percent to thirty percent of the time i stay home and i barbecue 

405.68 410.18 B: the other percentage of barbecue which would be about another forty percent 

410.06 423.06 B: that would be the time i would go out and eat that's because mostly because [laughter] i like the sloppy ribs you know [laughter] with all the sauce on it and stuff and [mn] and usually my wife and i usually make a 

416.92 417.98 A: (( oh yeah )) 

423.48 433.83 B: a day of it when we go out we let's say we might go to a movie or we might go see friends then go see then have dinner or something or we might go in a particular group of people 

434.55 435.52 A: right 

434.56 445.20 B: and it's a lot of fun because you go see the other people with all their [laughter] they look like little kids when they're finished eating because you know how that rib sauce gets on your face there and it stains you 

439.84 440.87 A: [laughter] 

445.36 450.23 B: and with vinegar in there and it turns it red and some people they really get into it 

450.38 455.64 B: and the bo- when they get down to the bone [laughter] there's nothing there even left for a dog [laughter] [mn] 

455.48 456.87 A: oh i agree 

456.93 459.51 A: i agree a hundred percent on that 

462.06 464.57 B: my wife usually does the chicken and ah 

464.67 476.06 B: when she does chickens at home she usually makes 'em on a rotisserie on the chicken on the grill on the back and she likes to roast it 

472.47 473.49 A: mhm 

476.81 479.64 B: i got a couple of neighbors ah they um 

479.69 490.81 B: they try to f- i don't know if you've ever done it but [lipsmack] did you ever take a turkey and stick it in the fryer these big fryers that's all full of peanut oil and they do it outside 

488.21 489.23 A: oh yes 

489.79 490.96 A: oh yes 

491.33 494.50 B: i i've never done that i always thought that ah 

494.51 498.07 B: that would be like it's really like it it seemed like a waste you know 

498.16 507.09 B: unless you're constantly making turkeys or something because you would you you put the oil in there you make the one turkey and if thanksgiving's over or whatever 

507.10 515.79 B: or christmas is over depending on the holiday your celebrating and then what do you have left you got all that extra grease and you can't really keep it 

510.86 511.69 A: right 

515.27 516.53 A: well you can 

517.38 522.57 B: even though you used it for ah putting in ah a meat c- 

521.10 523.95 A: right you you can reuse it 

522.98 530.11 B: you can still use it 'cause i figure it might get it would get rancid you know 'cause of the animal ah fats in it 

529.60 536.02 A: no you you can still still reuse it i mean after a one time shot you can reuse it you know after 

536.08 539.45 A: three or four times it's time to get it rid of it and get some new 

540.18 542.76 A: but you can reuse it ah 

543.65 546.58 A: it's it- it's good ah [laughter] 

546.90 549.52 A: you got to filter it pretty good though 

550.92 553.99 B: do you ever ah go to a restaurant and ah 

554.25 555.94 B: eat the barbecued chicken 

556.63 557.64 A: oh yes 

557.89 559.10 B: (( and ah )) 

559.34 569.33 B: what do you find the difference between barbecued chicken at home and the barbecue chicken in the restaurant ah you know wha- what i- wha- what is the 

569.49 575.84 B: the least favorite thing that you like about other [laughter] one other than that possibility they might have dropped it 

576.64 582.40 A: ah i have had times where y- you cut into the chicken and it's not completely done 

582.81 585.23 B: yeah tha- that spoils the whole meal 

584.61 586.07 A: (( and ah )) 

586.36 590.94 A: you know i- i'm the type of person especially with chicken or pork you got to have it done
