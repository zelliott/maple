0.19 1.54 A: chris 

1.16 3.20 B: hi i'm benji 

3.14 4.32 A: what's going on 

4.39 11.03 B: uh [laughter] i've never done one of these before and of course it's nothing um bland it's the middle east [laughter] 

6.21 6.98 A: [laughter] 

10.64 16.71 A: yeah no i've actually done two of them now [mn] i get a phone call and i'm like all right i'll do another where are you from 

16.53 18.26 B: pittsburgh pennsylvania 

17.86 22.37 A: all right i'm actually from boston but i'm in philadelphia going to school 

22.10 25.68 B: oh really yeah 'cause you don't sound like you have a boston accent though 

22.72 24.64 A: yeah 

25.04 28.97 A: no um like i went to private school and um 

29.13 35.53 A: [lipsmack] kinda a lot like for high school so i kinda lost my accent whenever i go back home it comes right back and then when i come back to philadelphia like 

33.75 34.72 B: (( [noise] )) 

35.41 44.58 A: i learn how to speak all properly again 'cause nobody here like everybody pronounces their rs and nobody says wicked and stuff like that so [laughter] i don't really say it but um 

41.89 43.93 B: [laughter] 

45.53 49.07 A: i guess we should talk about the middle east is that is that what the topic is 

48.19 51.84 B: i i believe so [laughter] 

49.19 51.27 A: [laughter] 

51.80 55.01 A: um what do you feel about that whole situation 

54.79 57.61 B: oh it's a mess [laughter] 

57.79 64.65 B: a horrible horrible mess but one of the questions was should we be involved and i think we should be more involved than we are now 

59.25 61.95 A: yeah 

64.35 66.46 A: you think more so yeah i mean 

66.45 80.98 A: i definitely think i don't know there's definitely a lot of anti war sentiment like around the country before um obviously before we went to war but like the thing that a lot of people seem to miss is that like nothing would have changed if we didn't intervene you know [lipsmack] 

81.29 87.22 A: and i definitely think that like there needs to be a change i don't know if like we're the ones that needed to do it because 

87.12 92.14 A: i it it's definitely like a tough subject you know because it's like there needed to be a change 

92.11 105.22 A: of course it wouldn't have happened if we didn't intervene but then at the same time like i don't know we went against like what the u._n. decided and stuff like that and now like more and more people around the around the world are just like ant- they're anti america you know 

105.24 117.16 B: mhm well yeah i mean i i agree [laughter] with you entirely i mean i i also think that something should be should have been done but i i i don't think that uh that was the wa- right way to go about it [laughter] personally 

105.51 106.21 A: (( and )) 

115.80 118.54 A: you dis- you dis- disagreed with the war 

118.85 121.61 B: with the way it was um 

121.71 123.24 B: initiated yeah 

123.92 127.83 B: i i don't really know that the u._n. would have ever done anything though so 

127.57 140.74 A: [noise] yeah no i know i mean it's an- and also there's like also the issue of why we actually went over there was it to to stop like you know saddam hussein and his like and his reign or was it just actually for oil it's 

128.29 129.47 B: [laughter] 

140.91 147.70 A: i think it was probably a a good amount of the reason why we went over was just for oil and like you know economic reasons and stuff and now like 

147.62 161.98 A: [mn] after we after we won i mean not we won but after like whatever i guess we successfully i mean no [laughter] we we won but like what did what did we actually win you know like after i guess we successfully um 

153.56 155.20 B: we won [laughter] 

162.24 173.71 A: ousted like the the the i don't know after we ended the rule of saddam hussein i guess you could say like how much time are we actually gonna put into establishing like a new like 

173.74 174.88 A: um 

175.65 183.67 A: i guess democratic or not yeah democratic government or like is that what i think that's what we're trying to establish over there right like in a 

182.29 193.88 B: yeah but the the problem is i mean even with a democratic government it really is very much a [noise] the u._s. has to pick and choose i mean there's that real sense that [noise] yeah you can vote 

191.40 194.45 A: (( yeah )) 

194.03 197.05 B: but it has to be somebody we like you know [laughter] mhm 

196.15 205.15 A: yeah exactly i mean it's it's like yeah exactly it's it's like a two two sided two sided double edged sword you know it's like 

205.12 218.49 A: we they we call it a democracy but at the same time it's like we're basically telling them who's gonna be in power and then it's like they're not really gonna be allowed to run their own country for a while i mean they definitely i don't think they're capable of running their own country especially right now 

218.41 219.30 B: mhm 

218.58 223.72 A: and i think uh i forget i was watching t._v. like a week ago and i think someone said 

223.77 233.32 A: the only if we really do put in like the amount of effort needed to successfully establish a government over there like if it it actually works like 'cause 

233.36 236.61 A: then it would be like a huge victory because 

236.44 250.34 A: then that that would that would just like provide a sense of like um not victory but like i don't know a sense of hope in that whole area you know like if we could establish one and one government and just establish order and stuff like that then 

250.53 253.19 A: there'd be like the possibility of you know 

253.25 257.13 A: maybe we could spread that around to the surrounding countries and sorta 

257.47 263.10 A: maybe take like you know there might be some more peace over there 

266.90 267.81 A: (( [noise] hello )) 

267.65 276.18 B: hi [laughter] no i mean that makes perfect sense so i've got nothing [laughter] to add to that 

268.05 269.22 A: oh sorry 

277.15 278.16 A: um 

277.39 281.30 B: uh what about the the roadmap that we've we've given to 

281.40 282.17 A: (( uh )) 

281.50 282.66 B: (( israel )) 

282.78 291.25 A: oh i actually uh i don't know i have a i'm not like that that up to date on the politic what's the what is the new roadmap 

282.96 283.68 B: what 

290.46 301.53 B: [mn] i'm really i don't think anybody knows what it is 'cause i mean i listening to n._p._r. and one reporter was like yeah well to tell you the truth i don't know what's on the roadmap and this was the guy who was covering it [laughter] 

300.86 302.79 A: yeah 

301.96 303.52 B: so um 

304.22 308.90 B: but i know that israel is supposed to stop making new um 

304.66 305.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

309.08 312.06 B: um not encampments but whatever they're called 

312.77 315.76 A: oh are we going after israel right now or something like 

315.13 324.25 B: well no trying to trying to create some type of balance um in power between israel and palestine and and trying to 

315.84 318.23 A: (( that )) 

322.92 323.85 A: uh-huh 

324.88 327.26 B: really work for some peace but 

327.27 332.41 B: i'm really kinda that's what i'm really scared of tension in the middle east because that 

332.75 335.53 B: combined with iraq seems to really have 

334.72 337.66 A: oh yeah no i definitely think that um 

336.16 337.37 B: (( p- potential [noise] )) 

337.92 343.19 A: that definitely is [laughter] a potentially explosive situation over there i don't even know 

343.26 354.10 A: the like all the details of uh the whole like pales- you know israeli palestinian situation i know that that's probably more of an issue than uh iraq was you know 

354.03 368.83 A: just because i mean the war in iraqi was like what a month and like when you look at it it it really is like a pretty easy victory i don't know i just think that i shouldn't even say that i don't even really have enough background to speak like on the whole 

368.85 376.94 A: israeli situation but just know that that trying to solve that that whole problem would definitely be um 

377.32 379.45 A: a challenge and like 

379.75 387.04 A: i don't know you know like i'm not even like at the same time it's not even really like our place to be there and to be 

387.34 397.26 A: like like we're trying to we're trying to dispel the image of a like th- the world's policemen you know but then at the same time we just go around everywhere and uh [noise] 

397.39 401.53 A: and like do whatever we want anyway i think someone was saying uh 

401.58 414.94 A: on t._v. they were like oh well this the reason why we went to iraq is solely oil they were like it's really not even a question to me you know [mn] and they were like um i think if uh like iraq was located at the southern tip of uh 

409.13 409.97 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

414.83 416.95 A: like south america i don't think 

416.47 418.15 B: [laughter] 

417.00 423.39 A: the united states would have really put in any time or effort to have like put to end to like th- the 

423.59 434.57 A: you know political unrest down there so that actually was like a- an interesting way of looking at it 'cause if iraq was actually at the southern tip uh south america then they're probably right you know 

425.58 426.49 B: mhm 

434.68 441.74 B: yeah we're we're w- what was the you say you know we don't wanna be the police of the world and and i know that for his um 

436.25 445.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

441.75 442.65 B: um 

442.96 447.94 B: campaign that that was one of the things that bush was saying but now it really does seem to be the opposite 

446.80 452.49 A: [noise] we're not we're not going to be [noise] yeah 

448.82 452.35 B: that we weren't gonna be that he didn't think that was our role but 

452.54 458.06 A: (( [laughter] )) 

452.82 457.60 B: but then of course well we're gonna pick places where we are [laughter] 

457.73 466.09 B: i don't think you can have it both ways i think you've got an obligation if you're gonna mix things up [laughter] or try and solve them mhm 

459.10 461.22 A: [mn] oh no you definitely can't 

465.46 467.62 A: no you definitely can't but i mean 

467.72 470.75 A: obviously that's the one thing that i mean 

470.99 485.34 A: when in a political campaign like the presidency like there's always [noise] bunches of lies you know lies upon lies upon lies like you ca- i don't think you can ever really believe what a president says in their campaign it's just 

485.43 487.34 A: i mean it's just like the way that they 

488.28 499.00 A: come across 'cause [mn] every president promises this and that and like they either it never happens or they either end up going like doing the exact opposite of what they say so 

499.20 504.38 A: like it's nice to hear that you know it's probably why a lot of people voted for him but 

504.77 505.90 A: what i don't know 

505.90 508.51 A: like we're definitely i think we're definitely we're obviously the most powerful 

508.52 521.17 A: country in like the world and i think we're always gonna be the the world's police and stuff like that it's just you know like we defied like the u._n. we go we basically do what we want [noise] and we're only getting stronger these days you know 

521.03 524.90 A: like more victories more more like 

525.00 538.69 A: more i guess more military power whatever it is and just i don't really see any other country i mean i guess other countries are probably getting stronger now with the evolution of technology and the passing of time and stuff like that but [noise] 

538.71 540.93 A: (( it's just i don't know )) 

544.22 546.55 B: it's sounds like video game in the background 

546.20 549.00 A: [noise] oh for real no i have uh 

547.95 549.31 B: do you hear that 

549.08 551.57 A: in mine uh i 

550.03 551.96 B: yeah well just just in the 

551.84 556.08 A: i have a a t._v. on right now like um 

555.05 556.01 B: (( oh it sounds like )) 

556.39 560.31 A: no i have an air conditioner a t._v. going in the background so 

560.45 561.39 A: (( um )) 

561.65 575.71 A: it actually [mn] i live in a i live in a frat house and like um i'm actually doing summer session one here for school and uh we're just we're trying to sublet out some rooms and stuff like that i'm like the house manager so 

575.44 576.96 B: [noise] oh [laughter] [noise] 

575.77 583.85 A: whatever it's been like it's been like hectic for the last like couple of weeks like we've had some like subletters coming in and then like at the first and stuff and like 

583.79 587.55 A: i'm trying to get people to like more out of their room by the first but like 

587.33 599.96 A: usually like the good thing about being the frat house like you don't have to like technically move out right on the first and stuff like that so i actually have a couple of um a couple of my friends in my room 'cause like i had to sublet out their
