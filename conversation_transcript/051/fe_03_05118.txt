0.69 2.16 B: (( hello this is john )) 

1.64 3.40 A: hi my name is aaron 

4.11 4.93 A: um 

5.47 14.31 A: so the topic was uh they said specifically that do we do we feel any other countries are threats to the united states is that what they said 

14.11 15.08 B: yes 

15.36 16.29 A: so 

16.65 23.76 A: what do they mean by [mn] i don't know just to clarify what do they mean by other countries they just mean just in general any country right do you think 

22.99 25.41 B: i would i would assume so yes 

25.09 25.92 A: um 

27.99 41.00 A: yeah well i mean this is an interesting topic i think i mean it's certainly a possibility that any one given person i talk to about this could be totally in the opposite spectrum of belief [laughter] to myself um 

41.89 43.25 A: i mean i don't know 

43.28 51.22 A: [mn] um [laughter] i mean my first thought is that when i think of who's a threat to us i don't think of countries 

51.32 54.98 A: i think of organizations 

54.67 57.69 B: yeah yeah i'll give you that you're right 

57.90 59.11 B: however 

59.75 60.77 B: um 

61.17 62.21 B: well 

63.06 66.21 B: i was gonna say certain countries seem to 

66.51 69.41 B: uh allow it 

69.92 74.63 B: but yet at the same time we can never forget what ha- what happened in oklahoma city 

74.70 81.41 A: right right that's the yeah that was something within our country entirely yeah um 

79.58 80.49 B: yeah 

81.70 83.07 A: i mean i guess there's 

84.08 97.94 A: um if you want to go a little deeper into the way that it defines something like that i could say that there are definitely countries that while not necessarily a threat in themselves are not helping any [laughter] uh 

97.11 101.14 B: yeah they they they tend to uh uh breed the mentality 

101.27 102.21 A: um 

102.48 114.91 A: i mean i if there's any one country that's a threat in any way right now it's probably north korea i suppose although i just think they're distant enough from us and also um small enough and 

115.63 118.25 A: and i guess not willing enough to 

119.11 125.49 A: to destroy themselves that i don't think i mean i think they could be a threat but i don't think that they would be 

125.94 129.69 B: mhm i unfortunately haven't really kept up with what's 

126.49 127.45 A: i guess 

129.84 136.69 B: the whole issue over there at north korea i know uh i guess i kinda got burned out on the uh 

137.11 140.83 B: news after watching the first two of the uh 

140.88 142.87 B: uh iraqi war 

142.38 143.02 A: (( uh )) 

142.93 146.69 A: well i don't blame ya you know [laughter] um [laughter] i mean i guess 

146.60 160.06 A: basically i mean what what's going on is it's just been a series of the same thing over and over again with them saying well we've get these weapons and and the united states saying you're not supposed to have them i mean nobody's made any threats or anything other than that they have said 

160.06 162.19 A: that they were doing something that they 

162.41 171.12 A: for whatever reason i mean i don't even entirely understand all the politics of why certain countries are allowed to have 'em and certain others are not um [laughter] 

171.05 174.03 B: i'll i'll give you that i mean i just feel the same 

172.34 177.19 A: i mean i just don't understand that not even a judgment there you know what i mean [laughter] [noise] 

176.29 178.17 B: right i mean um 

178.72 181.28 B: that was a big argument i had and i mean 

181.35 186.79 B: i really don't like what was going on over in iraq but to say that they had the 

187.61 196.95 B: they had the makings of of mass destruction well any farmer in america has those ingredients if you have 

197.00 200.52 B: uh uh you know a wagon load of urea 

200.60 204.26 B: and and a three hundred gallon diesel fuel tank 

202.52 205.58 A: (( right right )) 

204.57 210.86 B: you can do the same thing that happened in oklahoma city but does that make our our american farmers terrorists no 

209.88 210.93 A: right 

211.16 220.41 A: yeah and i mean the they've this has been said a lot of times about all this that anybody can look up on the internet how to build a bomb [laughter] if you want to um 

218.44 219.41 B: oh yeah 

220.95 226.93 A: they don't need the support of any country or any group to do so all they need is to be able to get their hands on the material 

227.22 236.49 A: um and like you say yeah farmers probably have the material and i'm sure a lot of other people who don't intend to anything of the sort um i 

235.61 236.48 B: yeah 

236.90 237.77 B: it's 

236.91 250.82 A: i i think that we certainly have bred a country of fear right now i mean i think that's the main reason that that the um there is i mean there was certainly protests against the iraq war but i i don't think there was as much as there might have been 

250.97 254.84 A: um if there hadn't been so much post nine one one fear 

255.14 256.25 A: i'm guessing 

256.47 257.23 A: (( um )) 

256.59 258.97 B: i would say you're probably right 

258.27 262.66 A: i mean i'm not old enough to remember vietnam so i don't know 

262.39 263.51 B: nor am i 

263.15 277.74 A: um you know i don't really know what the whole i mean i can read about it i can talk to people about it but i can't sense what it felt like to be going through it something at that time but it just strikes me that even so it certainly feels like 

277.92 283.79 A: i mean this is actually even different from the the first time we went to war against iraq at um 

283.86 290.74 A: i mean i think there are probably as many people who supported that one as there were this one but i think that the overall tone 

290.63 300.04 A: of the support was different this time and and i'm thinking that it's th- that fear that whole sort of fear factor that causes that uh 

299.33 300.41 B: yeah 

301.16 309.54 B: i know my father fought in the korean war but he will he will not to this day and to the day he dies he will not talk about 

304.07 304.97 A: uh-huh 

309.86 311.36 A: oh that's interesting 

311.81 316.96 A: he won't talk about what he did or he won't talk about the overall yeah yeah right uh-huh oh 

311.83 312.70 B: (( it )) 

315.08 316.64 B: um he won't 

316.86 318.30 B: period nothing 

318.33 321.33 B: he won't talk about it at all um 

318.60 321.26 A: yeah 

322.47 328.11 B: you know because basically the korean war was a police effort supposedly no different than 

328.34 333.45 B: than 'nam and uh and uh and you know what when we were going in to liberate 

333.60 347.10 B: kuwait and it's a little bit different to when we had to take the existing leadership but yet to at the point where they're at now it'd supposedly just being a policing effort to get democracy going in that country 

338.76 339.89 A: right 

347.94 356.74 B: and yet i know i i've kinda backed my father in a corner at one point and turned and asked him why he was so close mouthed about it 

356.88 359.96 B: and all he had to say was um s- 

360.81 365.88 B: something to the effect that the decision you have to make when a when a thirteen year old sticks a 

366.18 368.12 B: sticks a rifle in your face 

369.42 370.99 B: and 

371.21 377.63 B: this is no different in some ways than what saddam was doing he was using women and children as 

377.72 381.18 B: uh in a blockade human human barricade 

382.80 384.67 A: yeah i mean that's [laughter] 

384.65 398.62 A: i certainly wouldn't want i mean put in that [laughter] kind of position to have to i mean what are you gonna do you're gonna give up your own life for you know i mean i can understand how somebody who was a father or something regardless of 

393.76 394.61 B: yeah 

398.96 400.26 A: would resolve 

400.25 412.37 A: um that there are just things that they for whatever reason don't want to talk about and don't wanna bring back and and uh one of the things that i've always felt um about the whole 

412.37 419.18 A: concept of well do you support your troops or don't you i i think that's not really the question i think that's just sort of a uh 

419.33 420.23 A: um 

421.51 436.21 A: like a smoke screen for the real issue and and i think when people are in the military they made a decision that they're going to follow orders or else they wouldn't there that if somebody's gonna tell them they're going to war they have to do it so how can they go without 

434.50 435.24 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

436.37 446.69 A: without somehow being able to mentally convince them it's the right thing to do because if you have to do it anyway you have to at least be in the mindset that you're doing something that you believe in 

446.71 460.92 A: so i can't blame anybody for for who is who is there [laughter] for supporting what they're doing because how can they possibly protect their own lives and do what they need to do if they don't somehow convince themselves of 

452.04 452.97 B: yeah 

461.02 463.76 A: (( that )) 

461.30 465.89 B: and that was a i think a problem i had with some a lot of these uh 

466.31 479.44 B: um protests that were going on here in the states where the people would say they would say how'd they say they wasn't protesting the war they were supporting the people's right to stay home with their families well 

479.42 484.10 B: and i don't mean to sound cold but these people gave up those rights when they signed on 

484.09 496.31 B: with the military and they knew that it was a chance that they knew was there and was willing to take apparently and for someone else to stand up and say well we're fighting for your rights i'm sorry it doesn't cut it with me 

485.98 487.05 A: right 

490.47 492.31 A: right 

496.00 497.36 A: yeah that's 

496.56 499.13 B: well i guess we're kinda getting off the subject here anyway 

498.48 507.92 A: yeah oh yeah i guess maybe that's part of the point [laughter] is that that these topics sort of send you off to another top- subject and to be honest the topic itself i think is 

499.61 500.54 B: [laughter] 

507.79 522.24 A: it's it's um there's not a whole lot to say about it because i really don't feel like we're in danger from other countries i guess i think we're certainly in danger from terrorists who those people are where they come from could be a million different things um 

521.33 523.80 B: and here's another here's another outlook 

523.60 525.46 A: yeah 

524.27 525.36 B: um 

525.40 536.52 B: uh countries that how they say it are a threat to america i'll tell you a country i feel is a threat to america and that's mexico but not in a military cap 

535.75 537.87 A: right but in an economic way 

537.60 544.33 B: exactly they're causing us and them and china right now are causing us more damage than this war i feel 

538.26 540.43 A: yeah yeah 

544.28 549.72 A: well that's a really good point yeah if you want to define it that way then um 

550.28 563.92 A: anything that [noise] yeah that's that's true i mean you're probably right that if we're talking legitimate what's an actual threat to our way of life and to the wellness of [noise] people in our country i think that that's probably 

564.00 565.68 A: the best answer [laughter] 

566.04 566.89 A: (( um )) 

568.11 575.05 A: i mean it's a little it's a little complicated because a lot of that is the doing of our businessmen i guess 

575.00 576.23 B: oh yeah 

575.74 577.80 A: um so [laughter] uh-huh 

576.98 581.74 B: yeah i found it amazing when nafta went through that there was so many people 

582.11 590.59 B: that felt the way i did that it was not a good thing and i don't consider myself a highly educated person but 

590.82 595.34 B: yet if the common person like me can see a problem with a 

595.66 599.89 B: uh agreement with other countries why can't the leaders see it
