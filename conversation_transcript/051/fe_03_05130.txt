45.52 48.68 B: well yeah the ones that are running loose i mean 

49.15 52.59 A: a- as far as their attitude towards us now you know 

49.42 50.54 B: that 

52.70 57.20 A: um i don't think we solved the whole lot there over there 

57.23 59.71 B: um why i mean we've kinda got 

57.28 58.25 A: (( mm )) 

59.97 66.48 B: them calmed down i don't even know if saddam hussein is he could be in women's clothing for all we know hiding somewhere 

65.89 73.33 A: yeah exactly same with o- osama and you know well well my question is y- y- you know there they don't know for sure 

73.37 78.86 A: about a country that has no air force and um no navy 

78.96 86.65 A: you know so we can go over there pretty easily but we know north korea's been waving it in our faces for the last year year and a half you know 

86.94 93.45 A: and we know they have 'em and why aren't we there if if if we're really if that's what we're looking for 

93.28 95.48 B: yeah they can actually 

95.53 97.15 B: surprise us huh 

97.32 99.49 B: when we're not expecting it 

99.62 102.01 A: yeah they're a lot closer to us huh 

101.76 103.35 B: (( [sigh] yes )) 

103.28 108.31 A: and um and their attitude you know they're just blatantly have 

103.43 105.15 B: (( i know that )) 

108.45 116.26 A: um flaunted that they have it and they're not going to comply with the u._n. rules they're going to just pretty much do their own thing and um 

117.02 131.93 A: you know my question is what more do you do you really need if that's um what you're trying to eliminate is countries with weapons of of mass destruction and what gives us the right to say who can have them and who can't we have them 

130.54 131.61 B: (( oh that's )) 

131.67 134.10 B: we're not the world police so 

135.11 142.02 B: but ah yeah you're right about iraq i mean it was you know i mean we've gotta 

142.38 145.21 B: little bit of hand on it now but like i said 

145.49 150.14 B: um saddam hussein could be off running loose somewhere like some other 

149.04 162.05 A: there's actually more people dying there a day now than there was before the war started just it's happening in different ways now but um there's it you know it's pretty much like the wild west and um 

162.45 167.60 A: you know i don't know if you knew that half of the people in iraq are under the age of fifteen 

167.48 169.34 B: no i didn't know that 

169.34 174.26 A: and we've already killed they say it could be up to ten thousand civilians 

175.13 179.25 A: um yeah we're making the muslim world very angry at us huh 

179.59 184.05 A: and for us to and for us to not learn a lesson from um 

179.75 180.62 B: (( yes )) 

184.20 198.97 A: um israel and palestine you know they've been going at it for years back and forth back and forth and for you know people to think that that can't happen now with us what's you know all the ah muslim countries 

199.20 205.50 A: you know we're not making them happy by going over there and you know trying to say you know how things should be 

206.33 209.18 B: i know and i think we have to you 

209.49 219.65 B: know be on alert all the time look what happened with nine eleven they they'll probably if they're going to attack they're going to do it one probably not a holiday it's when we'll least expect it 

219.04 224.16 A: oh it's yeah and it's gonna be exactly and that's exactly and so you know 

224.50 232.71 A: all we d- all we have done you know pardon the expression is piss a bunch of them off that are already over here and um 

234.15 242.14 A: you you know every time we we invade a country like that they're gonna that's their way of getting back at us and you know we're gonna say 

242.24 246.81 A: boy i never thought that they could have come up with something more deadlier than the trade centre 

247.19 252.98 A: you know and all of a sudden they're going to show us that you know another thing we weren't thinking about 

252.48 253.56 B: (( i know )) 

253.83 257.43 B: and i'm sure there are plenty around 

257.07 262.89 A: well and that's their way of of of of um basically getting even you know um 

263.19 266.56 A: that's they feel they're in the right you know when we 

266.62 267.65 A: um 

268.37 275.51 A: you know what i mean as i say we've killed ten thousand over there already and those are civilians so they're the people under fift- the age of fifteen 

276.54 277.25 B: (( wow )) 

278.00 281.40 B: and i know and plus our boys have been killed 

281.98 286.26 A: yeah and it it's just it's just useless i mean 

286.40 287.33 A: um 

287.54 301.82 A: where it's really going to be funny is well it's not going to be funny i shouldn't say that but what wouldn't surprise me is you know they're talk- planning on getting a like up to a hundred thousand troops over there in iraq of our our guys 

302.09 306.30 A: you know plus the u._n.'s help whatever they give but um 

307.10 310.03 A: you know you get a hundred thousand americans over there 

310.09 314.93 A: or half of that that's when you set off a bomb of mass destruction 

315.57 316.71 B: yeah 

315.91 317.60 A: right there 

316.97 320.36 B: see that's dangerous very dangerous 

319.99 329.05 A: you know we're going over there and and and and you're better hope they don't have some because you know they could definitely destroy a lot of us now if o- 

329.11 333.00 A: over there if they do have those kinda of weapons over there 

332.98 334.55 B: yeah you wonder what they

364.01 366.67 A: well you know i mean if 

367.07 371.34 A: they went ahead with this war because the you know public approved of it 

371.76 372.79 A: and 

373.21 378.95 A: you know that's usually the only time they go er go ahead with a war is when the public approves of it you know 

378.77 381.15 B: yeah see my husband was in vietnam 

381.52 382.46 A: (( ah ))
