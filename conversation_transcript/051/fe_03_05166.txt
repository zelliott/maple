0.00 5.67 A: [noise] i think i messed up i think i messed up [noise] i think i m- yes 

3.48 4.74 B: [noise] hello 

5.42 14.45 B: hi ah my name is jack [sigh] and um i ah didn't quite get the topic for tonight it sounded like it was what can the government do about illegal drugs 

14.28 16.32 A: uh-huh that's the topic [noise] [noise] 

15.14 17.41 B: [sigh] [noise] oh okay [sigh] 

17.64 19.71 B: well let's see ah [mn] 

20.09 34.09 B: [noise] of course there's already been the war on drugs where we put a lot of people in jail and [sigh] [noise] ah tried to ah do inspections at the borders but [sigh] there's so much coming in at the borders that that's not been so successful so [sigh] [noise] hard to know from there and i 

34.04 40.83 B: [sigh] [noise] sometimes think that ah it would be wise to legalize marijuana because [sigh] ah it's just so widespread [sigh] [noise] 

41.31 44.95 A: yeah but if you legalize it then it would be more widespread [noise] 

44.33 46.11 B: [mn] yes it would [mn] 

46.37 53.01 B: [noise] just like ah alcohol is which is [sigh] responsible for a lot of p- problems too [sigh] [noise] 

46.59 47.73 A: (( and it it no )) 

49.55 50.43 A: (( you )) 

51.80 53.55 A: yes alcohol a- 

53.62 57.33 A: ah contributes to more deaths than all other drugs put together 

57.41 59.92 A: (( ah besides cigarettes [noise] )) 

60.18 62.02 A: cigarettes is the biggest one 

62.60 66.16 B: [noise] yeah [sigh] well a lot of problems [sigh] yes [noise] 

63.48 64.91 A: [noise] and it's legal 

65.40 69.17 A: so legal legalization wouldn't be the answer i don't think 

68.95 83.79 B: [sigh] well it would ah at least take a lot of [sigh] ah would the police wouldn't have to tie wouldn't have to spend time on it and there wouldn't be as many people in jail and that would be a [sigh] benefit on both of those sides and then the health [sigh] public health problems and social problems ah [sigh] [noise] 

69.49 70.81 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

83.95 86.58 B: well hard to know ah but ah it 

85.71 91.00 A: [noise] right right it wouldn't it wouldn't help the well that's the main problem the health problem really 

86.59 87.84 B: would be higher 

90.75 92.53 B: (( uh-hum )) 

91.11 92.57 A: (( ah i i would think [noise] [noise] )) 

93.00 95.59 B: [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] well what other things do you think might be done 

95.29 98.65 A: [noise] as far as ah the war on drugs [noise] 

98.07 99.95 B: (( [sigh] [noise] uh-hum )) 

100.10 112.94 A: well [sigh] [mn] i think it needed to come from the top see what they're doing now is they're they're they're they're arresting the guy the low level drug dealers right and they arrest one and soon as they arrest one 

108.85 109.94 B: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] uh-huh )) 

112.99 114.78 A: two more come on the street 

114.12 115.38 B: (( [noise] uh-hum [noise] )) 

115.42 119.68 A: so so that's not dealing with the problem [noise] [noise] 

119.31 122.78 B: [mn] y- yeah [sigh] well of course a lot of kids [noise] 

119.85 121.03 A: (( you you know )) 

121.08 124.88 A: [noise] well one thing you said if you made it legal right then th- 

125.32 126.64 B: (( uh-hum )) 

125.37 128.53 A: the money factor wouldn't be there any more 

127.52 130.26 B: (( [noise] that's right that would [sigh] [noise] ah )) 

129.39 132.05 A: that's one thing t- that's right that's true 

130.57 132.29 B: be a big change 

132.35 133.86 A: yeah the money [noise] 

132.39 133.50 B: (( [mn] and it's a p- )) 

133.51 145.50 B: problem because so many young kids see this as a quick way to [sigh] [noise] way to make thousands which they sometimes do and [noise] [sigh] at least until they get caught then that works out pretty well [noise] [sigh] for 'em [noise] [sigh] but so [noise] 

140.60 141.74 A: (( [noise] [sigh] [noise] )) 

143.07 146.68 A: [cough] right [noise] right that would that would ah 

147.30 152.28 A: that would um it would take the money incentive out of it so that's something to think about 

150.02 153.03 B: yeah yes it is 

152.40 156.20 A: you know legalization [sigh] but why just marijuana 

155.74 157.76 B: [noise] the other other [noise] 

156.33 160.84 A: what about what about narcotics ah substance controlled substance 

159.06 172.27 B: [sigh] well [noise] ah ah we're certainly t- tried to control narcotics [noise] yeah [sigh] i i would be reluctant to go along with that because i think the health problems would be much worse than marijuana [sigh] [noise] ah [noise] [mn] 

161.52 164.40 A: like ah [sigh] cocaine and heroine [noise] 

172.41 176.80 B: we don't ah have any really good way to know just what the outcomes would be [noise] 

176.91 178.56 B: (( [sigh] but )) 

176.96 179.47 A: (( [cough] [noise] yeah i'm smoking a cigarette mrs kenwyn [noise] )) 

179.50 180.93 A: i'm smoking a cigarette 

181.02 182.80 B: (( uh-hum )) 

182.13 183.73 A: (( [noise] huh [noise] )) 

184.86 186.54 B: (( [noise] [noise] well ah of )) 

185.61 187.12 A: (( oh okay [noise] [noise] )) 

186.81 191.00 B: course c- cigarette smoking has been so widespread for a long time that [noise] 

190.25 193.18 A: [noise] i know my landlord getting on me for smoking now [sigh] 

192.78 194.47 B: uh-hum 

193.49 194.70 A: 'cause i smoke 

194.54 195.50 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

195.48 196.46 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

196.74 200.43 B: [lipsmack] and so you'd be real unhappy if the government made that illegal [sigh] 

200.05 202.20 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] you know what )) 

200.48 203.35 B: and and wouldn't necessarily make you stop [sigh] 

203.44 205.29 A: right i have seen a 

205.96 209.90 A: [noise] situation where [noise] [noise] cigarettes 

207.20 209.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-hum )) 

210.09 212.72 A: [noise] were more expensive than marijuana 

212.43 214.22 B: (( uh-hum )) 

214.20 222.64 A: it was ah i- it was in a a prison right and they stopped smoking right they didn't allow they didn't allow cigarettes right 

217.52 218.56 B: (( [noise] uh-hum [noise] )) 

219.09 220.00 B: uh-huh 

222.00 222.89 B: uh-huh 

222.83 225.07 A: [noise] so cigarettes became illegal 

224.56 226.00 B: [noise] i see 

226.00 229.71 A: and cigarettes one cigarette was selling for five dollars 

230.70 233.12 A: and people were buying them 

232.75 240.93 B: [sigh] [noise] [noise] uh-hum [noise] [lipsmack] well i [sigh] of course there isn't ah at least as far as i know any attempt to make [sigh] [noise] ah tobacco illegal [sigh] [noise] and ah 

233.97 235.04 A: (( uh-hum [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

240.77 249.05 B: partly because of the the understanding that a prohibition like that would just [sigh] cause a lot of problems and probably not be successful anyway and [sigh] [mn] 

248.19 254.38 A: r- right because it would it would it would make cigarettes just like marijuana it would it would raise the price of 'em 

252.81 253.73 B: (( yes [noise] )) 

253.76 254.79 B: yes [noise] 

254.58 258.78 A: even higher because c- cigarettes are more addictive than marijuana 

258.44 266.97 B: that's true yeah [noise] [lipsmack] the other thing though of course we have now people who legally grow [sigh] [noise] tobacco and that would make a dent in their [sigh] 

259.93 261.34 A: yeah so [noise] 

266.91 274.80 B: [noise] ah profits or livelihood and ah they're already unhappy enough about those things so [sigh] [noise] that would be an additional complication there 

274.60 277.52 A: (( [noise] yeah yeah yeah i agree with you [noise] )) 

275.07 275.63 B: (( [sigh] )) 

275.69 278.72 B: [lipsmack] and some some studies indicate that the [sigh] 

278.48 286.47 B: various ah things that one inhales with the marijuana like carbon monoxide carbon dioxide might [sigh] [noise] cause as much harm to the lungs as 

286.32 295.32 B: [sigh] [noise] as ah cigarettes do and [mn] [noise] ah [mn] of course we that's not the kind of thing we can study well right now 'cause [sigh] [noise] that but on the other 

289.26 290.30 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

294.27 295.63 A: well what [noise] [noise] 

295.26 305.46 B: side i would certainly go along with [sigh] [noise] medical mari- uses of marijuana some people think that [sigh] [noise] it helps with ah nausea in chemotherapy treatments and something and something like that so 

304.16 307.64 A: [cough] [noise] [noise] yeah they say glaucoma too to a degree 

306.62 307.54 B: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

307.68 310.49 A: i heard they use it for glaucoma i'm not 

309.85 311.39 B: (( [mn] yeah [mn] [noise] )) 

310.69 312.24 A: totally sure 

312.24 314.94 B: so ah but ah but there's 

313.26 318.62 A: [sigh] no well has any studies been on the damage that [mn] marijuana smoke causes 

319.15 321.53 A: you know as opposed to cigarette smoke 

321.27 322.71 B: (( uh-hum )) 

322.58 323.99 A: is it worse or 

325.50 326.95 A: (( the same or what [noise] [noise] )) 

326.28 331.36 B: [noise] [mn] [noise] [noise] ah well ah i i i just t- that there have been [sigh] [noise] ah 

331.61 338.70 B: people saying that there's there's various things like the carbon monoxide and [sigh] carbon dioxide so that's a problem but [sigh] 

335.08 336.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yes ma'am )) 

338.06 339.96 A: (( [noise] [noise] i'm on the phone mrs kenwyn )) 

340.06 341.38 B: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

340.71 341.95 A: (( i'm on the phone )) 

342.59 343.95 A: i'll be with you in a minute 

345.07 353.09 B: [noise] [lipsmack] [noise] oh okay [sigh] [noise] and and of course the other thing is that marijuana b- by n- nature of it being illegal or [sigh] [noise] various 

345.23 346.40 A: okay i'm here 

353.17 355.56 B: might be o- other things in it 

355.45 370.16 B: [sigh] whether somebody's u- used to cut it to ah [sigh] [noise] ah just to increase their profit or because o- of other things then any way you you don't really know what's in it [sigh] [noise] ah and of course that somewhat true of tobacco since it's not really regulated by fda [sigh] 

355.56 356.32 A: (( [noise] )) 

369.98 374.48 A: [sigh] [noise] uh-hum oh it's not tobacco's not regulated [sigh] 

370.06 371.26 B: (( um [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

374.34 388.59 B: [noise] and ah of course one of the things the [sigh] [noise] the government has done some of already and could do more is just various education programs to help [sigh] [noise] a- ah young people understand t- to s- stay away from these things 'cause some kids do anyway [noise] 

385.79 390.46 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well that is that i believe that is the biggest 

390.86 392.58 B: uh-hum 

391.34 395.48 A: ah deterrent against drugs is education 

393.97 395.19 B: (( [noise] uh-hum [noise] )) 

395.34 396.40 B: [lipsmack] i have 

395.63 404.54 A: because i i i have noticed through the years right [sigh] like in the sixties right heroine was a real big thing 

396.57 398.09 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

403.93 405.58 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

405.22 408.20 A: and then it went down right because 

408.28 410.67 A: of the education that the kids 

409.86 411.61 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-hum )) 

410.95 412.53 A: got from seeing 

412.84 414.26 A: adults 

414.28 420.06 A: [sigh] being harmed by using heroine right and that generation stayed away from heroine 

416.49 417.87 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-hum )) 

419.65 421.21 B: [noise] yes [noise] 

420.66 423.40 A: right [noise] and ah they went to cocaine 

423.20 424.95 B: (( uh-hum )) 

424.38 425.95 A: [noise] right and now 

426.33 433.99 A: these kids didn't know that the ah e- effects of heroine so now heroine is big [sigh] and cocaine is going down 

432.02 432.85 B: [noise] oh 

433.83 435.10 B: (( oh okay [noise] )) 

434.17 438.00 A: very few [noise] you know younger kids use cocaine now 

437.74 439.32 B: [noise] i i see that's [noise] 

438.20 439.81 A: but they're on heroine 

439.90 443.41 B: uh-hum mm sounds pretty dangerous anyway [sigh] 

441.17 442.54 A: so ah [noise] 

442.77 447.57 A: i [noise] yeah well both both both drugs are highly addictive and ah 

443.66 444.79 B: (( and ah )) 

446.94 448.44 B: (( uh-hum [noise] yes )) 

447.58 450.60 A: [noise] you know schedule one narcotic but 

450.25 451.46 B: yeah 

451.29 451.99 A: (( [noise] hey )) 

452.33 454.28 A: i think that's that's 

454.33 459.08 A: the biggest deterrent is seeing [noise] [mn] the effects of it 

458.06 460.25 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-hum )) 

459.14 466.58 A: now i'm talking about like inner city kids who have seen like [sigh] their parents right on crack [sigh] [noise] 

464.62 474.52 B: [noise] [noise] right [sigh] some of 'em have and of course [noise] a lot of 'em [sigh] have seen their parents go to jail for it and then they're living with an aunt or an uncle or grandparents or something and [noise] [sigh] ah [noise] 

467.52 468.30 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

473.19 477.50 A: right so these kids right stay away from crack 

476.97 478.45 B: uh-hum 

477.76 479.13 A: they won't touch it 

478.69 480.69 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] yeah )) 

479.84 484.84 A: but unfortunately a lot of 'em have v- ventured out into heroine but they won't touch crack 

484.47 486.41 B: [noise] [lipsmack] oh i see well [noise] 

485.43 488.58 A: [noise] b- b- because of of what they seen it done to their parents 

488.19 489.61 B: (( [sigh] [noise] uh-hum )) 

489.04 490.62 A: you know so ah 

491.05 495.24 A: education is good but actually seeing the effects of it 

495.69 498.03 A: seems to be more of a deterrent [noise] [noise] 

496.10 496.71 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

496.52 507.05 B: oh i'm sure yes yes of course that sort of thing really can't [sigh] [noise] can ah be [noise] powerful on people [sigh] and i've had a chance lately to talk with some [sigh] ten year olds and they they speak 

500.15 501.07 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

506.84 521.20 B: ah favorably about t- their education programs in their schools [sigh] which isn't to say it's necessarily effective long term but at least they seem to [sigh] [noise] ah speak positively of it at this age so [sigh] [noise] maybe it's having a positive effect [sigh] [noise] 

511.50 512.68 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum [noise] )) 

519.23 519.85 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

520.70 525.87 A: [sigh] [noise] oh [mn] yeah yeah yeah i think that's the biggest biggest ah 

526.06 528.10 A: (( deterrent is ah w- )) 

528.20 542.71 A: watch seeing people whose lives have been destroyed by these drugs now you can tell you can tell somebody something right [sigh] but when they actually experience it and see it you know it h- has more of an effect 

531.39 532.56 B: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] yeah )) 

533.24 534.26 B: (( well [noise] )) 

536.25 537.58 B: (( uh-hum [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

542.13 544.37 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-hum )) 

543.38 544.44 A: (( [noise] i believe [noise] )) 

544.25 548.37 B: [noise] yes i'm sure [sigh] now one of the other things that i i thought because i i've 

548.30 548.51 B: (( [sigh] )) 

548.51 553.54 B: worked with some other kids and even and v- visited homes and i see a lot of homes where [noise] [sigh] ah the 

553.55 561.87 B: kids clearly don't read much and then so that's gonna [sigh] be a problem for their education and their parents don't read and so they don't have many lamps or they don't have anything 

561.88 569.32 B: [sigh] in the home to read and and [sigh] that of course slows them down in school whereas if we could somehow help them do better in school and they had 

568.70 569.50 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

569.10 578.59 B: you know better hope to graduate or a- and or get a job or going to college [sigh] you know if they had m- more of a future to look forward to then they'd be less likely to use drugs anyway [sigh] [lipsmack] 

578.27 581.43 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-hum [sigh] yeah i agree with you on that [noise] [noise] )) 

579.58 580.85 B: but that's [lipsmack] 

581.20 583.49 B: that's a [sigh] a multi a- 

583.57 591.77 B: a- ah system problem to deal with it's just to [sigh] get people ah starting to read at all levels and so forth 

590.00 596.23 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-hum [mn] well how about how about cutting these d- drugs off at the source [noise] like a 

594.92 597.24 B: [noise] i'm sorry [mn] how about cutting what [noise] 

596.25 599.95 A: [noise] cutting drugs off at the source like okay heroine
