144.17 149.44 B: not really too hard for me to strike up a conversation with someone um 

150.39 158.01 B: so that's it basically that's that's it for me um and i guess just through the years i've just ah accumulated you know a 

158.04 160.95 B: a a a big group of friends um 

161.08 166.15 B: which unfortunately this year a lot of them are getting married so i'm getting creamed with a

196.39 202.66 A: that's what i was going to say it sounds like your friends are not ah all a lot of them are not local so ah 

202.72 207.89 A: you pro- you might i assume you keep in touch with them by phone and then ah go to 

206.82 208.62 B: mostly by email

209.38 212.31 B: yeah most- mostly by email um

216.67 217.59 B: um 

217.45 219.05 A: (( yeah )) 

218.19 223.70 B: so i figure email is probably my main mode of communicating with most of my 

223.72 226.53 B: friends and family but then on those that i 

227.02 234.81 B: i guess carry about with on a regular basis would be more of the ones that are that are local and that i talk to on the phone more 

234.75 235.83 A: (( i yeah )) 

235.86 240.06 A: okay well ah let me tell you a little bit about my friends 

240.04 241.15 B: how old are you

242.52 243.64 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

243.12 245.43 A: and um you know i have 

245.55 255.09 A: you know ah ah again also family that that i would consider friends um not a large family but ah some that i'm very close with 

255.16 264.20 A: ah that i would consider friends i have friends you know what i have very few friends that i kept from 

264.22 274.81 A: school ah i didn't go to college and um i kind of changed schools when i was in high school 

274.69 281.15 A: i went to a i went to a highs- i went to a catholic school ah first ah gra- uh elementary school 

274.95 275.87 B: okay 

280.92 295.89 A: and then i i i started with a catholic high school and what happened was a- at the end of eighth grade the the kids didn't go to the same school i went to so it was like starting off ninth grade with a new group of making new friends 

291.73 292.58 B: right 

295.79 305.09 A: then it was would have been ah by eleventh grade i changed from i was ti- got tired of catholic school and i changed to the public school in fairlawn 

305.04 318.69 A: but a- again i left the friends behind that i had in the in catholic school and i and i tended not to keep in touch with them to y- so so i i had friends in when i went to fairlawn high people i knew from town 

318.57 319.48 B: right 

318.88 326.99 A: so tho- so some of those people i would still be in touch with today but ah it seems like from childhood i have very few friends 

326.95 331.17 A: but m- my main problem with friends is number one 

331.04 345.44 A: ah finding time for friends [laughter] and and number two um having patience to have friends [laughter] i find it i find it you know i m- maybe maybe it's me but i i tend to find people 

338.88 340.02 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

345.21 355.07 A: i i get annoyed at some point in my life most of the friends i've had at one point or another i've gotten annoyed with them [laughter] and didn't necessarily keep them as friends 

351.68 353.06 B: yeah e- 

354.77 355.73 B: right 

355.23 369.68 A: but ah that that seems to be i seem to have selected through the course of my life those people that i can tolerate and they stuck stuck as my friends and it's kind of not been a lot a large group 

369.51 370.86 B: i see 

370.08 372.73 A: so that's kinda how my life has gone 

372.55 381.42 B: oh yeah i guess over the years people change and ah yeah that's kind of some some of my friends who i grew up with now like i was 

381.48 386.83 B: um just this past weekend i ah the wedding i was at in dallas was 

387.18 392.61 B: ah first first kid i ah became friends with in kindergarten 

392.00 392.88 A: wow 

392.68 399.85 B: and ah we're s- we're still we still keep in touch to this day but you can see over the years how we've kind of ah 

399.87 408.92 B: we went to ah catholic school up until eighth grade and um most of my friends from the catholic school then went to the public high school 

408.69 409.66 A: ah 

409.12 416.57 B: um and we're still very tight with with all of 'em um through high school but i think like after 

413.03 414.07 A: yeah 

416.60 421.12 B: we all left for college none of us really went to the same schools and we all kind of 

421.17 424.99 B: went our own ways and did our own things um 

424.83 425.98 A: yeah 

425.35 438.62 B: i mean i guess which was good and bad now you know we're all all of kinda in kind of in different career path- paths which makes it a little bit interesting you know to learn about what other what other people do you know 

435.52 436.47 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

438.98 442.49 B: you know day to day you know to earn a living 

440.66 441.65 A: yeah 

442.26 448.65 A: yeah yeah i i'd like to go to a reunion certainly like to see people that i knew 

448.77 457.27 A: from long ago but again i just didn't have the um you know the time or the ah 

457.30 461.21 A: ah ambition to keep in touch with them on a regular basis 

460.98 461.92 B: yeah 

461.52 474.69 A: certainly like to bump into somebody from the old neighborhood and sit down and have and talk about old times i love doing that but you know a- apparently not enough to ah have kept in touch with them over all the years 

465.02 465.98 B: uh-huh 

469.38 470.28 B: right 

474.53 476.98 B: right right i'm i i'm 

477.02 481.61 B: some somewhat i just i had a reunion for grade school and i got 

481.81 486.54 B: um my ten year reunion for high school which is kinda awkward um 

486.31 499.77 B: 'cause from time to time from visiting my parents i do run in to people that i went to high school with and wasn't necessarily friends and [noise] it's you know like all of a sudden you're expected to be their friend and i almost feel like saying you know 

500.12 513.38 B: i wasn't friends with you in high school i don't know why you know you'd think things would be different now and i'd really you know wanna not to be rude but you know to you know there's probably a reason why i wasn't friends with you in high school or whatever so 

504.79 507.14 A: (( yeah [laughter] yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

512.54 516.13 A: just just 'cause just 'cause we know each other doesn't doesn't make us friends 

514.65 517.96 B: yeah doesn't yeah doesn't mean we have to you know feel like 

516.80 517.67 A: we're 

517.70 520.81 A: m- merely acquaintances [laughter] [laughter] 

519.36 525.78 B: right exactly i'm kind of more like you know hey how's it going you know good to see you let me get on my way 

525.42 538.40 A: yeah yeah yeah that's what seems to happen over life you know y- y- you you you an- an- and you know what probably looking back at it i mean i i kinda now kinda wish i had kept more friends along the way 

529.54 530.43 B: yeah 

538.65 546.29 A: you know y- y- y- it's it's too y- y- as you get older you realise you know the the job is 

546.66 551.50 A: less important and friends are more important really i mean 

551.85 563.45 A: when you're when i was young and ambitious you know the job was like the most important thing making money was the most important thing but as i've aged now it's like ah you know money's okay you
