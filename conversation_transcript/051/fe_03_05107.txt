0.20 1.31 B: hello 

0.27 1.43 A: (( hello )) 

1.80 2.66 B: hello 

2.31 4.10 A: hi my name is david 

3.85 5.64 B: hi david i'm susan 

5.33 6.66 A: hi susan 

6.96 10.22 B: um i guess we're supposed to give our opinions about the middle east 

9.85 10.77 A: now this 

10.60 11.78 B: [laughter] 

11.07 13.62 A: that's an easy topic for me [laughter] 

13.37 15.22 B: oh and why's that 

14.86 20.41 A: well partly because there's so much it's such a broad subject 

20.42 21.38 B: uh-huh 

20.94 24.64 A: ah some of these topics i've had are not nearly um 

24.69 26.25 A: as broad 

25.76 26.72 B: uh-huh 

26.62 33.70 A: i mean from the isra- israelis and palestinians the arabs and iraq and iran and 

33.95 38.47 A: [cough] i mean just on and on there are just ah 

38.52 42.24 A: huge numbers of topics [laughter] you know sub topics 

40.66 43.44 B: well well i'll give you my opinion [laughter] 

42.65 43.71 A: okay 

43.75 48.18 B: um i'll start with with ah the isr- with the um ah 

48.05 61.25 B: the effort to bring peace to that that whole area um i think that our president's doing a a fairly good job of trying to get in there and help them create some sort of of ah ah 

61.42 66.94 B: something to make peace there and allow people to live peacefully instead of killing each other 

66.84 74.33 B: but i am dismayed by that area because the whole it doesn't it appeared that those people because of their religious beliefs and i 

74.18 84.06 B: and i'm definitely not ah any kind of expert on it but they are very unpredictable because ah they don't seem to value human life as highly as americans do 

85.38 97.76 B: and that um that in itself [laughter] it makes it very difficult for me to understand um the whole um why people are blowing themselves up and killing others with them 

97.85 107.86 B: you know that th- i mean i could i could understand that people are gonna go in and blow up other people but to blow up themselves with it that you know for the um the glory of the jihad or whatever 

104.88 106.22 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

108.00 110.76 B: that just [mn] it blows my mind [laughter] 

110.48 114.83 A: yeah i i can't ah imagine being fanatical 

114.99 119.41 A: in in that in that regard of course we um 

120.03 124.98 A: you know i think in our culture generally just look at suicide in a negative way 

125.55 126.55 B: that's true 

126.17 138.23 A: and and i don't know about their culture but [cough] at least it sometimes i guess it's okay um i know the japanese you know had something somewhat similar anyway as far as 

138.43 141.52 A: you know suicide for the good of the country and the 

141.28 145.88 B: um mhm with the bombers the kamikazes mhm 

142.36 143.16 A: good of the 

144.14 145.43 A: right 

145.79 150.66 A: but i ah i think it's ah it's just 

150.71 155.06 A: so complicated um almost you know beyond 

155.54 162.16 A: [noise] beyond ah comprehension with all the different sub um conflicts 

162.18 172.67 A: um and and you know the biggest one of course is is israel and and the palestinians or israel and the arabs in general and um 

172.50 175.57 A: i think most of the israelis 

175.37 184.80 A: not certainly not all of them but most of them would like to have peace at some point um but many of them 

184.59 191.89 A: will not want peace at any cost so it depends on what you know what they're having to give up and 

191.72 201.44 A: and i um am am highly doubtful that that the palestinian organizations and the leaders and any military can be trusted 

201.74 202.81 A: um 

203.36 207.19 A: and so you know israel's such a tiny country 

207.28 209.11 A: ah geographically 

209.30 211.60 A: and there's not a lot of ah 

211.89 218.28 A: of room physically for um [noise] for palestinians um [noise] 

218.47 225.26 A: but you know one example i don't know how familiar you are with that history in that part of the world but until i 

225.21 227.85 A: think it was the war in nineteen sixty seven 

227.79 241.09 A: um jerusalem was a closed city and divided and you know not only and and the arabs restricted who could visit the various holy sites and since israel has has um 

241.26 243.21 A: taken over i guess you could say 

243.40 246.75 A: [noise] they allow much more freedom um 

247.33 258.62 A: in in for arabs as well to to visit the arab holy sites as well as christians and and jews um access and it is just so um 

259.00 261.58 A: so different from the way that the 

262.08 263.00 A: um 

263.42 265.36 A: (( i i think the mindset )) 

265.40 272.02 A: um of what [noise] the the arabs and palestinians seem to have um 

273.29 279.05 B: well you know i think it's gonna be difficult for them because each seems to feel they have a divine right 

278.97 280.24 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

279.61 281.21 B: um to jerusalem 

281.33 282.48 A: right 

281.85 287.88 B: you know and ah with both of them feeling like that and as strongly as they hold their religious beliefs 

288.28 300.67 B: um i think it's going to be very difficult to convince them that they can somehow work together and you know and you know it's almost like they cherish this um 

300.77 306.66 B: you know they have this high religious belief above the ah the what's better for the people 

306.49 308.80 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well i know that )) 

307.18 310.13 B: like the people aren't that important i guess 

309.85 311.81 A: i know that the ah 

311.96 317.42 A: you know the israelis are willing to share ah to to some degree um 

317.52 325.26 A: but the but the arabs [mn] you know at times have said they were especially in recent years 

325.28 326.37 A: um 

326.60 327.95 A: but 

327.97 331.12 A: there's just um so many 

331.92 338.06 A: [sigh] well as they said they do have their own you know their own interests and there and there are so many of them um 

338.61 341.45 A: you know at at times they've ah 

341.52 350.76 A: vowed to you know to kill all the jews and you know push 'em into the ocean is what they were planning on doing when when israel was first declared a country in 

351.25 364.38 A: forty eight i think it was forty seven um and of course that didn't work out the way they expected as far as the the arabs and and palestinians and and since then they've just you know been 

357.35 358.40 B: [laughter] 

364.73 367.03 A: more or less ah 

367.07 371.95 A: you know in a constant conflict or war and 

371.87 386.72 A: you know jordanians have lots of land but you know they're not particularly willing to create a a homeland for the palestinians and and there's certainly you know plenty of other countries but you know with huge oil revenues but none of them are stepping up to you know 

387.56 390.21 A: to talk about um 

390.46 395.73 A: resettling and and some of them don't even want to the palestinians don't want to [noise] because 

396.42 403.26 A: you know it depends on where you know what what land as you said they both have feel that they have a right to ah 

403.59 412.89 A: to live in a particular area but but i do think that if the israelis weren't being bombed and shot at then they would not um 

413.90 417.50 A: [lipsmack] be creating going out of their way to create a conflict ah 

418.05 427.74 A: but you know i look at comparing it to um [noise] um northern ireland you know with the protestants and the catholics you know they're both christians 

427.98 432.89 A: and they've been fighting for i don't know how many hundreds of years and ah 

433.09 438.71 A: you know i don't wanna be like the british you know that are caught in the middle and end up fighting both of 'em 

438.25 447.16 B: well that's true and i think we've done a good job in iraq as far as ousting the leadership and hoping to get in a better leadership 

439.10 440.17 A: and 

441.61 442.58 A: mhm 

446.57 447.91 A: mhm 

447.27 450.54 B: and i think part of the reason is is the leadership 

450.56 463.45 B: in those countries have been unwilling to step up and take responsibility um to condemn the war to condemn these people who are being um you know who are doing suicide attacks who 

463.53 466.60 B: [mn] it takes a strong leader 

466.81 470.73 B: ah to lead his his or her people um ah 

470.77 473.00 B: down a path of peace 

472.70 473.62 A: mhm 

473.31 480.35 B: because you're going in some cases against the will of the people you know or at least the people who are extremely vocal 

476.47 477.64 A: right 

480.59 494.17 B: um and so the we're in there in lies a problem where you may be cut off from ah from you r people because they decide [mn] well he's not the one and we're gonna come and oust him and get somebody who thinks like we do [laughter] 

493.44 494.91 A: right 

494.38 499.30 B: so it's it's it's so unstable um it it it seems like 

499.36 502.70 B: ah it it will be very difficult to attain that peace 

503.31 507.84 A: [noise] [lipsmack] yeah i i um i agree it's it's going to be um 

508.67 511.25 A: um you know interesting um 

512.18 513.15 A: ah 

513.39 526.56 A: just seeing how all the different um things play out all the different factions and and you know it's certainly things going on right now and talks going on and least we're talking about starting 

526.84 530.64 B: well that that's more than they've done you know within the last how many years 

528.70 529.48 A: (( in )) 

530.23 543.07 A: yeah and i and i think that's you know certainly helpful it's better to be talking i i still have a hard time somewhat understanding why that you know they sit in a room and they just can't 

543.26 544.23 A: (( you know )) 

544.26 554.81 A: [mn] why there's so much trouble just getting along i mean i know why it is but you know but when w- we all come down to it we're all people and 

556.18 558.54 A: [noise] it shouldn't be that hard to just you 

556.46 557.78 B: (( well [mn] )) 

558.02 563.41 B: again i think unless unless the leaders are willing to be strongly for that peace 

563.57 571.90 B: you know and strong enough to um to come to the table and be willing to you know give and take a little bit 

564.19 565.21 A: (( know mhm )) 

571.28 572.52 A: right 

572.14 580.12 B: i don't think it's go- you know it's not really gonna happen and with the united states can bring pressure as you know in certain political ways 

580.06 594.12 B: you know um to say if you want us for you know to give you money for help or um as far as more trade or something like that you know they can say you know this would be advantageous because we'd look upon you more favorably if you did this 

594.02 595.12 A: mhm 

594.36 599.89 B: um i think we can do that to a certain extent but again i still think we're dealing
