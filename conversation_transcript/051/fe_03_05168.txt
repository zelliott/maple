74.60 82.82 A: al- although you know if you if you draw that line at the bottom of canada straight across i mean [sigh] places like toronto or further south of boston [sigh] 

82.01 84.15 B: well that's yeah that's very true 

82.99 87.77 A: yeah and and you guys are probably further north than some of ontario too i mean 

87.02 92.35 B: i wouldn't yeah i that's probably t- true if you think about that that's very true [sigh] 

90.46 94.17 A: [sigh] 'cause this kind of little hooky thing hangs down there and [sigh] 

93.34 104.22 B: w- well now you gi- give me your perspective here now um we've had a lot of corporate scandals in the united states now i'm not t- too familiar with a lot of 'em up in ah canada or ontario [sigh] now 

98.46 99.48 A: (( [noise] y- yeah )) 

101.23 102.46 A: [sigh] 

103.22 103.98 A: it 

104.13 105.34 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

104.76 107.90 B: i i think um [lipsmack] well you know [sigh] [mn] 

107.89 120.23 B: i look at it [sigh] one of the things i was looking at is like ah martha stewart you know she in the ne- she's in the news and you know what [sigh] i i think i think s- she kind of got a- ah she's kind of getting the screws put to her [sigh] 

111.74 112.70 A: uh-hum 

116.42 116.98 A: (( [sigh] )) 

120.30 127.51 B: even though she knew this person [mn] and the guy gave her the information [lipsmack] she sold it off at a at what nineteen 

127.50 128.55 A: (( [sigh] [mn] right )) 

127.61 135.07 B: [sigh] it went all the way down to five [sigh] and now it went it's today it closed at like thirty five and cl- closed at like thirty five [mn] 

134.78 135.91 A: (( hm )) 

135.35 137.42 B: she actually l- [laughter] lost money [sigh] 

136.81 138.44 A: [laughter] yes [sigh] 

137.19 147.76 B: in the whole in the whole s- scheme of things [sigh] but i mean you know what [sigh] insider trading and th- there you know i i g- grant you there is there is corruption at the top i think in in a lot in a lot of different businesses 

147.54 159.60 B: [sigh] but um i r- really think in the united states [sigh] a- and in canada as well probably [sigh] um i think what r- really makes the e- engine turn are the medium t- to small size businesses 

147.64 148.71 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

159.03 159.97 A: (( uh-hum )) 

159.45 168.12 B: that's what makes i think that's what really makes that engine run because there's a lot of ingenuity and there's a lot of [sigh] a lot of drive i i mean [sigh] i know in in my business in what i do 

168.24 169.52 B: [lipsmack] i sell wine 

169.37 175.34 B: [sigh] and and ah in in our business [noise] i tell you it's you know you have to be [sigh] 

169.42 170.13 A: mm 

175.11 187.13 B: you have to be competitive [sigh] you have to be on the top of your game [sigh] and there's not a lot of room for for error [sigh] and i think when you you know you look at a lot of these corporate scandals and you look at a lot of the ah 

187.23 194.30 B: ah [lipsmack] people on top who are maybe ah you know taking advantage of t- their employees like enron and and things of that sort [sigh] ah 

192.36 194.07 A: (( [sigh] sure yeah )) 

194.12 204.05 B: [sigh] you know those people i f- feel they are getting the th- they did get the shaft [sigh] um but i think a lot of the majority of people who work for for small to medium sized companies 

203.87 216.63 B: [sigh] ah i think there's more of a handle on their corporate accounting than there is in these large companies [sigh] ah in in large companies there's a lot of ah there's a lot of graft and i think that happens a a lot in the federal government as well 

208.80 209.88 A: (( [sigh] [cough] [sigh] [sigh] i )) 

215.89 228.83 A: [mn] [sigh] yeah i wonder if it's a whole matter of of s- scale the accountability [sigh] like if you go into any store now i mean i i'm a f- freelance journalist so [sigh] i researched a whole bunch of different things and one of them is that [sigh] 

224.67 225.44 B: okay 

228.66 236.93 A: the the general consensus is that the larger the ticket on the item the more you should be able to negotiate the price [sigh] for basically haggling 

236.57 237.80 B: yeah sure yeah 

237.03 243.40 A: but i don't know what it's l- like ah where you are but you go into a store here and you're probably talking to some clerk who's making 

243.16 254.45 A: [sigh] minimum wage and has no more say in the price of the object than i do [sigh] and you can't get to [sigh] the people who are making the decisions now they're either physically remote or they're 

247.02 247.92 B: sure 

254.40 260.12 A: it's an american corporation or a multi national corporation and and you just cannot get to the people [sigh] 

260.03 269.84 A: we had an example here i live in a very rural part of tow- um ontario we've got a town of two hundred and [sigh] it's cottage country and i- influx of people in the summer but [sigh] 

265.61 266.39 B: okay 

269.66 280.65 A: there was a a local b- branch of a bank it was open two days a week [sigh] the municipalities did all their banking there rather than toting in all their tax money into their main bank [sigh] and this bank um 

277.33 278.14 B: (( [noise] uh-hum [mn] )) 

278.37 279.10 B: (( okay )) 

280.48 292.31 A: they were going to close the branch and they called up t- the fellow in huntsville which is half an hour away next biggest town and t- the manager and said [sigh] you know please don't close it we need it and he says it wasn't my decision it came from headquarters downtown 

285.44 286.23 B: okay 

291.46 292.62 B: (( oh yeah [sigh] yeah [noise] [sigh] )) 

292.21 298.26 A: [sigh] and there's there's just nothing you can do so [sigh] they do whatever they want and i think in 

298.31 308.32 A: times it's like if you can get away with a little bit you try and get away with a little bit more you think you can get a little bit more [sigh] and yeah as you said the the common people the the average working people um [sigh] 

308.28 317.45 A: they end up losing all their money and the ah executives all go away with multi million dollar s- severance packages [sigh] and get a slap on the wrist if they're caught 

314.92 315.79 B: well 

316.81 327.79 B: [mn] well i think [sigh] ah in in some regards [sigh] ah that that you know that that's true [sigh] and i think y- you know um it comes down to economies of scale [sigh] 

327.37 328.40 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum )) 

327.79 332.22 B: ah economies of scale in the united states are um 

332.40 343.68 B: if you look at the companies and you look at the corporations that i deal with [sigh] ah i deal with southcorp i deal with a lot of different southcorp is an australian company and they own [sigh] um 

343.55 354.97 B: well they've been buying up a lot of different properties but they their their major corporation their major assets are [sigh] and [mn] i don't know if you drink much wine but ah [sigh] um liedemans rosemont penfolds 

355.01 360.99 B: ah the three ah they make up probably s- seventy five percent of the market [sigh] well it used to be 

356.63 357.34 A: mm 

359.14 360.00 A: wow 

361.15 369.89 B: [lipsmack] it used to be just ah liedemans and pinfolds and then l- liedeman and penfolds bought rosemont which was number two now they all have number one two and three [sigh] 

365.27 365.83 A: (( [cough] )) 

367.17 367.73 A: (( [cough] )) 

369.68 370.57 A: jeeze 

369.77 382.86 B: and and [sigh] ah their economies of scale have gotten small have gotten larger but they're they're ah corporate offices have gotten smaller [sigh] so there's more work to do for people who [sigh] 

379.48 380.39 A: (( uh-hum )) 

382.67 395.96 B: ah already are pretty much taxed to the limit [sigh] and and ah all these people you know everybody looks for short cut after short cut to try to you know ah make their balance sheets work out [sigh] and ah 

386.26 387.54 A: (( uh-hum )) 

392.57 393.57 A: yes 

395.80 398.55 B: [sigh] and you know [mn] i don't know like [sigh] 

398.36 412.70 B: wh- where you are i mean it we- you know it it's nothing for me to work a sixty hour week is it you know and and [sigh] and i i would love to have the aspect of being able to not [sigh] work that and s- spend more time with my family 

403.04 404.22 A: (( uh-hum )) 

412.27 413.49 A: [sigh] yeah 

412.66 417.02 B: [sigh] but i think we're you know i i mean where you are sounds paradise to me 

416.25 418.69 A: [laughter] well yeah 

417.30 422.00 B: you know because i love to hunt and fish so ah [laughter] 

419.22 421.76 A: oh well yeah you're in the right place for that [sigh] 

421.55 435.88 A: but you see t- the again you but the flip side is that there isn't the industry there isn't the income like you either come up here with an income [sigh] or for me actually it's not bad because any place that has a phone i can write an article for and send it over the internet [sigh] 

427.69 428.54 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

429.02 430.09 B: yes 

433.92 435.09 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

435.24 436.67 B: oh yeah yeah yeah 

436.04 438.31 A: but um it's 

437.15 438.69 B: that's a saving grace 

438.49 449.41 A: [sigh] well [sigh] y- yeah if if if you don't want you know some of the [laughter] things that are going on i know [sigh] i went t- to school in the states and a friend of mine who'd gone off to join the peace corp came back very disillusioned and he said 

445.32 446.06 B: okay 

449.25 462.85 A: [sigh] these people were perfectly happy until we went in there with our boom boxes and our sweat shirts and they wanted them and the only way they could get them was to destroy their country because [sigh] they needed american dollars to buy 'em and they other but before that they were perfectly content [sigh] 

452.88 454.16 B: (( [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

456.48 457.66 B: yeah 

459.01 460.50 B: yeah yeah 

462.82 466.19 A: until we taught them how little they h- [laughter] had you know [lipsmack] 

464.69 467.66 B: right right yeah yeah they ah they knew no better 

467.54 469.07 A: yeah but that [sigh] 

467.70 469.59 B: yeah yeah they knew no better 

469.35 480.13 A: i i i i don't know and and you know you talk about the the companies buying up other companies and ah [sigh] we we run into that up here to a degree but um [sigh] 

481.04 485.46 A: i don't know there was something i was going to say and i've lost the thread and that bugs me [laughter] 

484.09 489.74 B: [sigh] well but that's okay i i you know to to pick up i think where you left off you know i mean ah [sigh] um 

487.79 488.50 A: (( [sigh] mm )) 

489.75 492.90 B: [mn] i i i do believe that y- ah 

493.01 498.59 B: what drives what drives o- our economy especially in the states you know what [sigh] you know people look at us 

498.46 508.39 B: in the united states as you know this a eight hundred pound gorilla on the backs of everybody but i i really feel that [sigh] [mn] you know um [mn] if it weren't for a lot of the things that [sigh] 

502.71 503.88 A: (( [sigh] [laughter] )) 

508.21 515.36 B: that this that the whole e- economy of the united states and [sigh] in the world g- generates 

515.18 516.07 B: um 

515.87 529.73 B: y- [sigh] i don't think everybody would be a- as well off as they are today i mean our our standards of living have have risen pretty dramatically [sigh] and and and i think ah you know it all goes back to the to the ingenuity of of small pe- you know of small businesses but i 

516.34 517.07 A: (( uh-hum )) 

522.75 523.81 A: (( [sigh] oh yeah )) 

529.05 530.75 A: (( uh-hum )) 

529.70 540.70 B: [sigh] i do believe though that ah [sigh] you know there is going to come a time when when a- a- ah you know larger corporations a- are going to have to pay the piper [sigh] and if they don't get these accounting a- 

540.75 544.22 B: a- ah if they don't get these accounting strategies straightened out [sigh] 

540.81 541.96 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

544.06 551.02 B: um you know we- we're going to end up ah you know taking a di- you know taking taking a hit again [sigh] and now the stock market has been up the last few months 

550.77 551.65 A: (( uh-hum )) 

550.88 565.01 B: and everybody's you know starting to get back on the bandwagon well you know [sigh] all it's going to take is one ah [mn] you know one wrong accounting f- firm or one wrong ah cor- l- large corporation to have an accounting scandal [sigh] and you can see this thing go right down the tube again you know [sigh] okay 

561.71 562.49 A: yeah 

563.88 564.45 A: [sigh] 

564.32 576.30 A: yeah well i i wonder you know some of the the cultural differences like i ah was out in the philippines went to university out there for a year and [sigh] and and the differences in culture like i i was thinking of of banking up here 

576.09 582.33 A: we've got um banks will not give loans to small businesses so friends of mine [sigh] 

576.79 577.48 B: (( [cough] mm )) 

582.24 590.65 A: owned a a computer store he he had been in computers forever fixed them serviced them sold new ones and da da da it was him and his wife basically maybe a couple of clerks [sigh] 

587.76 588.48 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

590.49 597.97 A: they couldn't go to the bank and get a business loan or even a loan based on the business [sigh] because um they owned it themselves 

597.82 599.30 B: oh okay 

598.18 599.89 A: so there was not it was almost con-
