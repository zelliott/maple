63.59 64.88 B: [laughter] 

63.73 66.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

66.19 67.74 B: (( [noise] )) 

67.33 70.27 A: (( [sigh] well from ah anyway from um )) 

71.25 74.52 A: [lipsmack] from the high finance point of view how how do you 

74.64 85.18 A: [sigh] how do how do you control that um [lipsmack] i i my my own [noise] my perception of of why it happens is because 

77.63 78.99 B: (( [mn] [mn] y- yeah [noise] )) 

85.26 86.50 A: (( [sigh] ah )) 

87.37 92.23 A: [sigh] ah pe- people don't want to le- you know record the appropriate business 

92.29 96.91 A: accounting numbers properly and they you know are able to 

97.29 101.90 A: (( [lipsmack] they are able to get ah um [sigh] the accounting firms )) 

102.16 103.61 A: to um 

104.38 110.11 A: [lipsmack] to participate in their [sigh] illegal perceptions of their of their profits [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [noise] 

110.45 112.42 B: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] well i i think it's )) 

112.76 121.52 B: based on that and i'm sure that there is you know a profit motive um you know why not do something you know i know it's c- cynical but [sigh] 

121.71 133.81 B: if you're gonna do that for [sigh] you know p- personal gain [sigh] you know what better avenue to do it from than a business [sigh] where people might not expect that where [sigh] you know they expect 

133.65 147.22 B: you to deliver a product and sure you're in it for profit but they don't expect you to [sigh] take anything more out of that so that they i would think that [sigh] people are kind of blind [sigh] maybe to that sort of thing [sigh] maybe not so much any more 

147.68 161.34 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] well the suggestion that we hear on on television is is to make the the accounting firms as as independent as possible [sigh] from from the from the business firms in other words [sigh] the people who do the [sigh] 

155.20 156.07 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] uh-hum [noise] [noise] )) 

161.52 170.84 A: who do the auditing should have no other [sigh] business relationship with a business that they're doing business with [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

167.19 168.81 B: (( true that's true [noise] )) 

170.66 175.05 B: yes that's that is one of the big ways i think that you can [sigh] 

175.16 177.13 B: that you can curb it um 

178.24 181.64 B: [mn] and um i think that's 

181.65 193.70 B: p- probably the main drive of it um [sigh] i'm not saying it's all the fault of the accounting companies [sigh] but if they're the ones that sign off on things like that [sigh] then it is and they do 

193.95 197.29 B: [mn] share some of the blame of course [sigh] for that 

196.63 202.70 A: [sigh] well they they share some of the blame if if they're trying to generate additional business 

202.12 203.69 B: (( [noise] [noise] yes [sigh] )) 

202.48 215.39 A: [sigh] from from additional [sigh] services that they want to provide to their [sigh] to the companies that they're auditing [sigh] now if they're not permitted to provide those types of services from the from the get go [sigh] 

209.50 211.07 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right [sigh] [noise] )) 

212.47 213.75 B: (( mm [sigh] )) 

215.12 216.42 B: [noise] 

215.76 221.64 A: then [noise] then hopefully then a a measure of independence can be maintained 

221.45 234.06 B: [sigh] so you're saying um [sigh] that the government should [sigh] create tougher rules for interaction between the auditors and the business in terms of [sigh] extra auditing practices [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] 

233.38 237.59 A: [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] [lipsmack] well i i i don't i i'm not about to 

235.30 236.44 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

237.59 238.55 B: [laughter] 

237.91 240.52 A: rely on the accounting firms 

240.66 250.91 A: [sigh] to police themselves [sigh] i don't think they are capable [sigh] in a in a in a capitalistic system of policing themselves [sigh] they're there to make a profit [sigh] 

245.75 246.32 B: (( [sigh] )) 

250.96 260.52 A: they're there to pay to pay their salaries [laughter] as i always say they they're there to pay their boat payments [laughter] so somebody else has to step in 

253.61 254.17 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

260.85 263.04 A: [sigh] and and do 

262.28 262.99 B: (( sure )) 

263.14 264.88 B: can we trust the government

266.54 268.58 A: [sigh] to to to 

268.97 271.17 A: guarantee the independence 

271.34 273.23 A: of the auditing firms 

272.88 276.89 B: right um but can we trust the government to do that when the government has 

276.90 282.79 B: you know collusion with some of these companies when they work very closely with some of these groups 

279.26 280.81 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

282.05 287.39 A: [laughter] [laughter] that's a that is such a good point oh what a what a [sigh]

297.41 299.76 B: that the vice president did um 

299.89 304.60 B: and i suppose that we have to trust that the government will do things 

304.61 305.78 B: [sigh] you know 

305.91 312.65 B: to our our advantage and will step up these practices um or against these practices

334.13 338.93 B: m- i think it'll be a [sigh] a long process but i would hope that 

338.98 348.10 B: the government would create a body and then just say okay it's our hands off now we [sigh] really can't be involved in this aspect any more 

347.76 354.75 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] i i i agree with it i agree with the need for an independent regulatory body um 

349.26 350.06 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

355.54 360.14 A: [lipsmack] ah it it it has to be something [sigh] some some type of governmental

360.48 368.69 A: ah agency that that's [sigh] that doesn't currently exist and isn't c- currently attached to some other organization somehow [sigh]

424.20 425.42 B: (( right right [sigh] [noise] )) 

432.47 437.58 A: [noise] and they should understand the appropriate governmental regulations

515.83 528.31 A: [sigh] ah it's just gonna to take a while for this cycle to work its way out [sigh] this is ah just like it took a good number of years for the nineteen twenty nine bubble to work its way out 

522.83 524.79 B: (( [sigh] uh-hum [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

527.47 532.46 B: ah [sigh] it took what eleven or twelve [sigh] ah if you want to say it
