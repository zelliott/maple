52.80 57.87 A: ((  )) 

59.99 66.32 B: [sigh] [noise] uh-hum [noise] [noise] mm but do you think they could have done anything to prevent that like like [noise] you know 

64.28 65.27 A: [sigh] 

66.09 80.40 B: not to [noise] like like before a- anything ever ever happened [noise] to enron itself [noise] like actually to monitor everything and [noise] that and that wouldn't [noise] that the whole thing wouldn't have wouldn't have happened 

72.04 72.95 A: uh-huh 

79.17 83.66 A: [sigh] [mn] yeah i think they probably need to have a standards of accounting practice 

83.10 84.96 B: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] yeah that's what i was thinking [noise] )) 

87.53 98.08 B: 'cause if they're if they actually account for more of the things [noise] that e- everybody every like everything that g- goes on throughout the whole business or whatever [noise] it wouldn't happen as often 

95.09 96.17 A: (( uh-hum )) 

97.73 106.37 A: yep i agree [sigh] i think that you should have a [sigh] a general standard of book keeping that all the major corporations have to abide by 

99.27 101.19 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

106.03 107.63 B: [noise] yeah yeah 

107.80 113.88 A: and then they have to [sigh] i think they have to report probably to somebody in the government [sigh] 

114.51 116.08 A: annually 

117.23 118.10 A: (( ah )) 

118.71 121.40 A: to see that they're keeping up with those practices 

120.70 126.99 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-hum [noise] [noise] yeah but [sigh] w- what kind w- who would they account to govern government wise [noise] like 

127.00 134.46 B: w- is there is there right now is there a p- position or anything that a person who could ac- who could who could actually take charge of 

134.00 136.43 A: [lipsmack] they'd probably have to create one i guess 

136.12 137.85 B: (( that yeah )) 

137.29 138.97 A: [sigh] i know with ah 

139.11 143.36 A: [sigh] the stock market they have this sec- securities and exchange commission 

143.03 144.10 B: [noise] yeah [noise] 

143.64 145.82 A: [sigh] and they they're really tough 

146.32 148.22 A: [noise] you know about ah 

148.58 150.35 A: [sigh] their regulations 

150.33 152.06 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

151.56 157.36 A: [sigh] and i was reading in the paper yesterday that martha stewart [sigh] has been indicted by the federal government 

154.84 155.70 B: (( [noise] what )) 

156.87 158.90 B: oh yeah 

157.55 159.11 A: for securities fraud [sigh] 

159.73 162.28 A: (( well yeah but for )) 

159.88 161.44 B: (( they need to have something special set )) 

162.83 165.55 A: [sigh] i guess corporations' ah bookkeeping too 

162.94 164.64 B: yeah but actually [noise] 

166.85 173.32 B: yeah but to actually create that for actual position thing that would take a long time [noise] right and 

173.15 183.94 B: you know what i mean like to actually create like a government person that actually is in charge of everything that'll to actually put somebody in like that in place or whatever that'll take ah that'll take forever 

176.62 177.48 A: (( mm uh-hum )) 

177.88 179.08 A: yep 

183.91 187.20 A: [sigh] yeah they need to have it done fast that's for sure 

184.68 185.90 B: (( like they )) 

186.41 187.22 B: huh 

187.81 191.29 A: [sigh] they need to if they were to do it they need to have it done pretty quick 

190.56 202.86 B: [sigh] yeah exactly [noise] 'cause that would that would be a good long term [noise] ah solution or whatever but i i can't ah i don't know about in the short term thing you know like w- within a year or something 

203.30 206.60 B: [mn] something and they could actually pass it and ah 

206.77 216.98 B: i guess each business could do that [noise] but like then that would that would mean like the actual business people would have to decide that they want their businesses to do to actually w- do that you know 

216.70 218.35 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum [noise] uh-hum )) 

218.04 223.04 B: ah t- the government would have no say in what goes on [sigh] 

221.16 222.95 A: (( [lipsmack] yep )) 

223.12 227.62 B: so that would all depend on just the c._e._o.s i guess 

230.42 232.33 A: [noise] and there was another corporation 

233.75 238.89 A: [sigh] i'm thinking a major corporation that said that [noise] 

238.39 240.15 B: (( [noise] um [noise] [noise] they had accounting discrepancies )) 

239.49 242.97 A: i think it was a big utility company in louisiana 

242.08 244.26 B: (( they did [noise] oh really )) 

243.35 244.95 A: you know because we 

245.07 246.81 A: we hear um 

247.86 251.72 A: about texas and louisiana news where i'm from i mean that's 

252.66 259.88 A: [sigh] it was a big utility company i can't remember what the name of it was but they said that they found that they had fraudulent ah [sigh] statements 

260.31 261.55 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh [noise] [noise] oh okay )) 

260.61 262.73 A: (( and i think they could get in big trouble )) 

264.31 265.39 B: (( oh i )) 

267.75 269.81 A: [noise] so it's an interesting question 

268.89 271.19 B: see yeah i know but 

271.47 278.04 B: ah that that means like [noise] ah there's no actual thing that they could do for like r- right now you know 

277.72 278.75 A: (( uh-hum )) 

278.19 284.26 B: like i said it would it would all have to depend on the actual businesses government can't control that 

283.21 284.67 A: (( [mn] right )) 

287.13 290.26 A: [noise] [sigh] so do you think that martha stewart ah 

290.54 291.38 B: huh 

291.03 293.50 A: but do you think that martha stewart ah 

293.95 295.60 A: [sigh] ah should be indicted 

294.67 298.91 B: [noise] i i i didn't keep up with all that wh- what was that all all about 

298.48 299.55 A: (( [sigh] ah )) 

300.31 303.76 A: [mn] she bought stock in a in a um 

304.53 308.48 A: a biotech company [mn] and ah 

309.79 310.77 A: (( ah )) 

311.96 319.63 A: somehow encouraged the price of the stock to to be inflated [sigh] and then [sigh] she sold the stock 

316.38 318.16 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

319.15 320.88 B: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] uh-hum )) 

319.73 322.98 A: [sigh] ah like before they found out that ah 

323.08 328.49 A: [sigh] ah the company ah was a fraud [sigh] so the stock on it was high 

329.10 330.27 A: (( and ah [sigh] )) 

331.56 333.58 A: ah so um 

333.73 339.65 A: the the federal government it's the government that ah indicted her yesterday on securities fraud 

339.24 341.89 B: (( [mn] [noise] yeah [noise] oh she was already indicted and everything )) 

341.51 348.53 A: uh- uh she wasn't indicted yet [sigh] she was being investigated [sigh] and they indicted her yesterday and ah today 

343.41 344.40 B: oh 

348.69 351.38 A: ah she resigned as 

351.98 352.92 A: (( ah )) 

353.31 356.45 A: chief executive officer of her company 

355.57 356.52 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

357.26 359.86 B: and she she already resigned 

358.79 360.38 A: [lipsmack] she resigned today 

360.37 365.59 B: wow that m- means she probably does is involved in all the thing 

364.26 367.25 A: [noise] [lipsmack] yeah it doesn't look good 

366.93 368.75 B: yeah 

369.52 376.21 A: and that's basically [sigh] the same scenario happened with enron in in ah houston [sigh] is ah [sigh] 

374.79 376.23 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] oh )) 

376.50 377.61 A: (( they ah )) 

378.44 388.83 A: ah gave ah bad ah [sigh] accounting statements and pushed the price of the stock up and then the corporate executives s- sold their stock while it was high 

389.63 390.91 A: (( [sigh] and ah )) 

391.25 392.33 B: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

392.08 399.64 A: then ah when they found out that ah [sigh] they didn't have m- money then the then the stock dropped [sigh] and ah 

400.61 406.00 A: the ah employees lost all their retirement money and their retirement plans and 

405.08 408.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] everything wow )) 

406.35 407.83 A: (( [sigh] they lost everything )) 

409.05 417.84 B: [noise] that means damn that would that would mean like [sigh] all their all their future funds and everything would just be told they're lost right 

416.58 418.37 A: (( [mn] yep )) 

418.68 419.61 B: oh 

419.33 421.98 A: yeah but it it affected thousands of people 

422.52 429.24 B: yes that that's another reason why t- the government should actually take control of everything instead of these actual businesses [sigh] [noise] 

429.54 438.82 B: actual businesses just like having their own thing like i i mean not not government take control of everything [noise] [sigh] but government actually having a part in it you know like having the say [noise] 

439.35 440.69 A: (( uh-hum )) 

440.63 454.05 B: like [noise] say l- like a government who have like a like each business would have like ah advisory committee and [sigh] like ah like government people are ah are in appointed in the advisory committee 

453.11 454.61 A: (( uh-hum )) 

454.18 455.88 B: (( huh yeah )) 

455.23 459.71 A: [lipsmack] yeah well [mn] that would be one to to do it 

459.02 465.58 B: yeah it it's kind of like t- the three branches of government right now you know they e- each have their checks and balances 

464.71 465.96 A: (( uh-hum )) 

465.34 477.14 B: like if if a if each business would if each business w- would be able to do that too then e- everything would be set you know 'cause n- not one part of the business [noise] or not one business would do w- do whatever 

477.02 482.98 B: they whatever happens to it destroy the whole thing [noise] everybody would be able to watch over each other [mn] 

480.01 481.31 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

483.04 491.13 B: that ah that's the only way like our gov- like our government has survived this long so it would probably work for businesses too [sigh] 

488.76 489.69 A: yeah 

492.00 495.27 A: [sigh] yeah but how would how the companies that ah 

495.49 500.08 A: [sigh] that ah say they want free enterprise how would they feel about the government 

499.77 502.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah sure [mn] )) 

500.42 501.80 A: putting the ah 

502.42 504.26 A: restrictions on 'em 

504.53 505.96 B: yeah free enterprise 

506.34 510.38 B: that would be i don't know how that would work with businesses 

514.05 515.29 B: [noise] and 

518.49 527.12 B: hm [noise] well w- wouldn't it still be a free enterprise even if even or it was like say the government doesn't actually have l- like government isn't actually involved in it you know 

526.93 527.91 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

527.15 534.35 B: but they're just they're having a say in it they're just like just giving advice to what the business should do or what the shouldn't do 

529.48 531.10 A: right 

536.14 538.59 A: [sigh] [noise] [lipsmack] yeah i guess they could be advisers 

538.63 551.59 B: yeah like t- they're they're just monitor monitoring monitoring the whole b- business there so that so that they're just monitoring so so as like [sigh] they're not like actually taking control of the company but they're just like 

551.42 559.21 B: [sigh] l- l- looking if they're doing everything within bounds and everything like so that they don't pass their boundaries a- and you know [mn] 

554.99 556.65 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

565.42 570.25 B: [noise] [noise] huh [sigh] what do you think like what do you think ah what kind of action should be taken [noise] [noise] 

570.82 573.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] [sigh] well )) 

576.55 579.31 A: [sigh] [sigh] you know i don't think that it should be 

579.76 582.78 A: legal [sigh] for a company to say 

583.50 584.57 A: (( ah )) 

585.28 588.51 A: that they've made x. amount of dollars for the year 

587.93 590.10 B: (( hm [noise] uh-hum )) 

589.09 591.96 A: to push their stock price up 

590.97 592.05 B: (( [noise] uh-hum [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

592.13 595.43 A: [sigh] and then have their executives buy the stocks
