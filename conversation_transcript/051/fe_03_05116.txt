28.91 34.24 A: ((  )) 

34.49 39.62 A: (( what do you think [noise] yeah [noise] yeah definitely yeah it's uh )) 

39.19 41.10 B: that's for sure that's true 

40.88 50.30 A: ((  )) 

50.53 56.04 A: (( the other any other things we were supposed to uh talk about or [laughter] oh i think maybe it was also uh )) 

56.40 57.66 A: do you think 

57.19 65.94 B: well i think we should remain involved in the middle east because i don't think uh anything good will happen if we don't stay involved there the only thing i'm against is all the money 

65.71 77.09 B: we keep pouring into that area i mean uh every year we give uh millions upon millions of of dollars to uh countries like israel and countries like uh 

77.01 85.98 B: uh egypt and uh you name it just about all the countries over there that we want to have uh to be at peace we almost like we bribed them to do that 

85.14 86.46 A: (( like peace is )) 

86.57 89.64 B: and then uh what we get for just aggravation 

89.45 91.49 A: (( possible in the middle east or )) 

89.94 96.30 B: on the other hand they uh it probably could be a disaster if we weren't involved over there 

96.29 101.64 A: (( whatever and [laughter] they've been at at at odds for what is it thousands of years or )) 

102.10 103.10 A: (( something like )) 

103.39 110.58 A: (( that and uh you can't get you can't even get the arab countries to agree amongst themselves nevertheless agree with )) 

110.23 121.47 B: no uh actually uh i couldn't i y- you were lucky you got this one i could make any of it out the recording or whoever it is that places the calls doesn't come across too clear 

111.02 112.33 A: (( some kind )) 

121.18 126.89 A: (( of peace deal with israel uh nobody agrees with anybody over there )) 

126.30 130.74 B: oh okay that's an easy one i don't think there'll ever be peace in the middle east 

130.29 131.94 A: (( well i'm glad we went )) 

131.46 145.27 B: (( [laughter] yeah i don't know i mean yeah and i )) 

145.37 148.08 B: (( i don't know i feel )) 

148.40 155.51 A: (( in i'm glad we went into iraq because we got rid of a monster another hitler uh by getting rid rid of saddam hussein and those people the )) 

156.35 171.20 A: ((  )) 

169.57 175.18 B: (( like everyone sort of yeah no definitely like )) 

175.20 182.10 B: (( all the governments are totally at at odds with each other and there's no real no one's willing to compromise on anything pretty much )) 

182.41 183.60 B: (( so it's )) 

183.66 188.94 B: (( kind of hopeless but if i don't know i'm kinda i'd like to think that there's )) 

189.02 190.27 B: (( some some hope )) 

190.57 194.55 B: (( so i do [laughter] the only )) 

195.86 206.33 B: trouble is is that the snipers that are there every day we're losing more more guys since the peace process uh uh started over there than we had in the war over there 

206.19 208.16 A: yeah that's that's true 

207.93 214.96 B: and plus the other country i think is uh our worst enemy is a country we consider an ally and a friend that's saudi arabia 

214.64 218.01 A: yeah saudi arabia is as bad as iraq definitely 

217.35 227.26 B: i think they're probably worse than everybody else because almost fifteen i think out the nineteen uh people that participated in nine eleven thing was saudi arabians 

226.97 229.22 A: and uh that's true yeah 

229.19 235.48 B: and they bribe our congressman and everything else that's the only reason that we consider them an ally is they bribe everybody 

235.35 236.69 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

235.59 247.10 B: it isn't even a political party thing they do it on both sides they they just try to bribe everybody and even if they don't succeed in that the propaganda that they're able to spread is enough 

246.67 250.77 A: yeah it's a it's a big mess i don't know like how 

250.53 257.82 B: [noise] and then you've got suicide bombers over that area there's just too many things happening there i think uh 

251.83 253.83 A: [laughter] 

257.89 264.99 B: uh it's disturbing because they uh another world war could break out because of what's going on in that area 

264.02 276.58 A: yeah it's just it's just [noise] a horrible cycle of violence i mean if people could just all stop at once like maybe there would be some hope but everyone you know it's all revenge and revenge and back and forth and just i 

277.14 277.88 B: it's 

277.16 278.14 A: (( don't know )) 

278.05 287.78 B: amazing that uh people won't live in peace uh together i mean without but i i don't see why people don't realise that they lose more by being at war with 

287.88 290.67 B: with other people i guess it's a power thing too 

290.80 299.99 A: yeah it's just yeah i think people when they they i don't know like when they maybe it's like an economic thing when they're really poor you know they just 

299.93 307.46 A: need to find some kind of identity and meaning so then they latch onto these things and just become fanatics you know and that's all 

307.56 311.67 A: (( after that it's like you can't really talk to them you know it's like what are you going do [laughter] )) 

311.16 316.92 B: well you got all the palestinians living in those whatever they call those camps that they're living in 

316.02 317.90 A: refugee camps yeah 

317.00 323.81 B: and as you said poverty is a big thing they have nothing so what what do they lose they figure if they um kill themselves 

324.63 328.05 B: uh they figure they're not gonna get a better life anyway 

327.76 334.33 A: yeah exactly i feel like maybe if people there have like and also like you know if their governments were more 

335.45 348.58 B: yeah well that's who's holding them down is their governments is because all the money that we pour into that area i think most of it goes to the rulers and some of these dictatorships and nothing filters down to the uh to the ordinary person 

348.40 354.17 A: sure sure yeah and it's uh it's just a big cycle of 

354.30 357.20 A: terrible terribleness uh-huh [laughter] 

356.95 364.03 B: it is it's terrible because the the there doesn't seem to be any uh any way out of that turmoil 

364.09 366.35 A: yeah um 

366.64 374.68 A: oh if i knew you know [laughter] i would be out there like uh going around and telling people but [mn] i don't really know [laughter] 

374.19 382.30 B: i'm glad of one thing i'm glad i'm not in iraq when i hear what the temperature is up up there and uh that's just one miserable place to be 

382.18 391.59 A: oh sure yeah definitely [laughter] uh it could be the weather is a big factor in why everyone's so crazy over there i mean it's just hot and dry and like 

390.67 395.94 B: i don't know how people even move around in that they said it reached one hundred and forty degrees one day 

395.09 397.57 A: (( [mn] oh my god really )) 

397.43 400.01 B: air conditioning wouldn't even help at that temperature 

397.61 398.69 A: wow 

400.13 411.05 A: no man yeah that's no wonder jesus christ yeah a hundred and forty degrees [laughter] yeah i mean i think it's just like very inhospitable part of the world like i don't 

411.11 414.92 A: feel like people are meant to live in temperatures like that you know 

413.67 422.62 B: and look what look at what our soldiers they're not only in a hundred and forty degree temperatures they're wearing backpacks and all that heavy equipment 

414.98 415.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

420.66 423.77 A: oh yeah lugging all their stuff definitely 

425.10 434.07 B: and then you've got the reporters who voluntarily uh went over there to embed themselves with these that's the first time i've heard of that word it's silly 

425.17 426.11 A: yeah 

433.57 440.43 A: yeah i think it was [laughter] created possibly for that [laughter] i don't know i never heard it either so 

441.10 455.70 B: well i i i don't see any ending to that situation and it it's just gonna i i can't see uh because uh j- just when you have peace with one f- there's too many factions i mean even if you figure groups like hamas let's say they decided to uh 

455.59 469.21 B: uh join into the peace process then you've got about five other terrorists groups that don't want to do it so there's no way you can get a a hundred percent or fifty percent even of the terrorists because they have too much to gain by not having being at peace 

469.11 483.45 A: that's true yeah i mean yeah that's that's also the problem is like the the on both sides like they actually need each other to like keep themselves going you know like the right wing israel and then the you've got the terrorists in palestinian territories or whatever like 

483.31 488.66 A: they both rely on the others to like get support from their own people you know what i'm saying like 

488.70 503.65 A: you know like sharon and it was like get gets elected pretty much on being like you know these guys don't want to talk to us so we have to like you know crack down on them and then on the other side it's like you know sharon's not going to talk to us so we have to like keep having terrorism or our associate [noise] 

502.54 512.73 B: no the one is as bad as the other they're all bad news i mean uh i don't think they'll they ever have it that that's what i say i don't think there's ever gonna be a way for them to have peace over there because 

512.71 521.58 B: uh no matter who you get as a a ruler whether sharon or you or you have arafat or you have any of these other guys uh there's just too many factions 

519.67 520.62 A: yeah 

521.82 523.11 A: (( wait hold on a second )) 

523.13 526.07 A: yeah i'm on the phone i'll be off in a minute
