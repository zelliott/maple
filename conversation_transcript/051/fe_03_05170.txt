2.17 4.42 A: hi derek i'm daniel 

4.05 5.08 B: hi there 

5.25 7.77 A: how you doing where are you from where you calling from 

6.56 9.16 B: i'm in seat- i'm in seattle [sigh] 

8.56 11.46 A: oh i used to live up there i'm down in los angeles now 

12.02 13.97 B: down where you can actually get a job 

13.95 22.12 A: [laughter] that's one of the reasons i left uh so okay uh outdoor indoor activities is that the topic here 

16.24 17.64 B: [laughter] 

21.81 23.34 B: i think that's what it said 

23.35 26.69 A: right and uh what are what are your preferences there 

26.78 34.21 B: uh i don't i don't know i uh i just uh have been working so much recently that it's kind of a an aside but [sigh] 

34.96 38.71 B: and the living up here things have changed quite a bit as well with uh 

39.23 46.27 B: the vagaries of the weather and different climate you know being wet and gray most of the time it's kind of uh difficult to do things 

46.33 49.08 B: outside as like far as i'm concerned [sigh] 

46.43 47.66 A: outside 

49.33 60.24 B: but uh now that the uh weather has cleared up and it's uh sunny and bright and uh almost phoenix like it's uh it's a lot more [sigh] lot easier to get outside and do some things 

60.36 68.72 A: and and what are you like uh you're a golfer or a tennis fan are you more of like a i don't know uh bowling or 

68.19 69.60 B: [laughter] 

69.70 77.92 B: i'm probably more the bowling type but you know when it's nice out i just go for walks and uh ride my bike that kind of thing nothing really exciting or organized or 

77.08 78.55 A: (( yeah )) 

78.23 79.35 B: just uh 

79.65 87.75 B: you know there are lots of trails and things to go on and uh before they closed all the state parks and all that kind of stuff you know you'd go for walks in there 

82.03 83.24 A: yeah 

89.02 97.85 A: i've uh i used to do a lot of hiking up there and uh i'd go up to whistler and do uh a little snowboarding that was always great um 

98.52 99.56 A: uh 

99.48 104.88 A: i generally like prefer doing stuff outside when i'm inside it ends up being uh you know 

104.82 117.49 A: sitting around and watching sports on t._v. and drinking beer so [laughter] i always feel i do myself more of a favor if i can [sigh] get on outside and and eliminate that part of it but uh 

106.83 109.45 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

116.10 118.68 B: wouldn't be so bad if you didn't drink the beer i guess 

118.58 129.40 A: no but you know how it is you know sometimes they they say why are are sports televised for sports are for drinking you know and so you know [laughter] it's just you know it's impossible 

124.34 126.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

129.39 134.78 A: when i was there we used to go to the ram a lot which is like a big sports bar out by uh udub 

134.65 135.42 B: mm 

135.39 140.98 A: and uh it just you know you can waste like you know especially like uh you know on sundays 

140.75 143.80 A: it- it's football or during like a tournament you can just 

143.81 158.15 A: easily eat up a whole twelve thirteen fourteen hour day in there and and not even realize you know it's raining outside and that's like a great excuse and then you're just in there and you know it's pretty enjoyable too but i don't know now that i'm uh down here in in 

147.45 148.97 B: [laughter] 

158.07 171.88 A: southern california it's uh the weather's a lot nicer and it's sort of more motivating to like go and do stuff and hit the beach and and go surfing and crap like that so i think i'm definitely a little bit healthier but i don't know which one's more fun really 

170.91 172.73 B: [laughter] 

172.36 174.11 A: (( you know what i'm talking about )) 

173.39 186.98 B: right yeah i was always troubled more in the times i've been in l._a. just that the air has been so bad i haven't really been able to do much outside just because of the i i guess i've been places where the air isn't so bad and just being in l._a. when the air is bad it it just really really affects me 

186.78 188.83 A: yeah you can tell the difference 

188.07 197.65 B: oh yeah there's a there's a there's a tremendous difference there there was a time when i was driving i was on my way somewhere else and i was going just along two ten i didn't even actually go right through the city but just along two ten and uh 

197.56 211.34 B: [sigh] the air was so bad i couldn't i couldn't even see i had to pull over and and use a wet wipe on my eyes just 'cause the the air was so bad 'cause my my eyes were watering so much and so that makes me think you know that even if i were to live there i wouldn't wanna spend a lot of time outside 

210.75 218.16 A: [sigh] no you know when you when you're flying over or when you're sort of like looking at a distance you really can see this brown layer 

217.75 218.69 B: yes 

217.98 226.96 A: and you and you think like oh those poor guys over there and you're right you know that's what it looks like you know around you you just can't really tell as much as when you're looking in the distance 

226.65 227.53 B: (( yeah )) 

227.28 237.06 A: so i mean it i guess it does affect you you just get used to it i guess it's it's terrible to think about that you're just getting used to like living and breathing in this like totally dirty environment but you do 

235.92 238.14 B: yeah [laughter] 

237.39 247.08 A: you do i'm i'm sure it you know it's worse you know coming into it you know being from somewhere else you don't you really notice it but when you're here you know you get used to it just like everything else i 

240.59 241.57 B: right 

246.70 248.11 B: [sigh] yeah well 

247.17 253.92 A: think i'm lucky i'm lucky 'cause i live out by close to the beach so it's a little bit weather the weather is a little bit better 

253.50 257.91 B: right right you get the uh the breeze off the ocean that comes in and blows it away 

256.30 257.36 A: yeah 

257.38 263.95 A: yeah yeah i don't know are are you doing anything are you doing a outdoor indoor activity today 

264.31 265.99 B: uh i'm just kinda 

264.70 266.49 A: (( on this fine sunday )) 

266.13 281.10 B: i'm just uh kinda hanging really right now yesterday we uh we have motorcycles and we went and rode yesterday i had to go and get a new tire uh i got a slow leak in my tire so and it's been bothering my wife that i just pump up the tire every week and just ride around on it on it that is disturbing her so i actually went and 

280.46 282.18 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

281.83 290.44 B: [sigh] sprung for a new tire and uh then i found out that i can't put it on myself so i have this tire i have to find someplace that will put the tire on for me but um 

290.67 299.75 B: you know it's uh it's really nice biking weather right now actually it's a little too warm 'cause when you put the jacket on and the helmet and everything like you're supposed to wear i get it gets pretty toasty if you're actually in the sun and not moving 

299.36 301.61 A: (( right right what do you ride )) 

301.22 306.73 B: uh i've got an eighty two yamaha vision i bought from a lutheran pastor of all things 

306.76 311.44 A: is that [laughter] is that like a a cross rocket or 

310.88 319.35 B: no it's well i guess it's it's kind of like before the concept of the cross rocket really took hold it's kind- you can you can kind of see it looks like a knight rider bike 

316.16 317.09 A: uh-huh 

319.37 322.16 B: you could imagine david hasselhoff riding it 

319.78 320.43 A: (( huh )) 

321.51 324.49 A: [laughter] 

323.70 328.82 B: it's got the you know it's got that kind of uh that it's got a cowling over the light and um you know 

328.66 340.32 B: it just has that kind of shape and it's got those you know early eighties looking kind of aluminium mag wheels on it and you know it's it's a little big for me i probably would have done better to have a smaller bike but the price was right and you know [sigh] 

340.39 346.46 B: i didn't [mn] it had been ran well and it's in good shape so i just went ahead and sprung for it 

346.27 351.78 A: right and how come the pastor was getting rid of it was it not meeting approval with the flock or 

350.77 364.47 B: [sigh] uh uh no it just sat in his garage for years and he never rode it and then he didn't want it around once he had a kid that was that was uh going to be approaching driving age and he didn't want his you know adolescent son to get the idea in his head that hey i can just ride this little bike of dad's 

363.36 366.30 A: [laughter] 

365.00 366.22 B: so 

366.31 374.51 B: that seemed like a perfectly rational kinda decision on his part to to part with it so i went and and just paid him for that and 

373.89 375.23 A: right 

374.67 388.15 B: it seems to have done pretty well i just think it's a little big for me i mean my feet you know touch the ground when i straddle it when i stand on it but they're like it's like they just touch the ground you know if i weren't wearing the boots i wouldn't i wouldn't be able to touch the ground so it's probably a little big for me it's a little it's a little heavy 

385.61 386.86 A: (( got it )) 

387.97 393.20 B: my wife has a newer bike she has the two thousand and one uh suzuki savage 

393.30 404.84 B: it's actually a bigger bike it's a six fifty and the one i've got is a five fifty so hers is actually a hundred cc's larger but it's a mu- it's much lower to the ground it's one it's like a a cruiser you actually sit in it instead of on it like my bike 

405.38 410.16 B: and you're much lower to the ground and it's just a lot lighter bike it's a lot easier to maneuver 

410.48 415.81 A: and did you get her into it or did you sort of meet and you were both already riding or 

415.31 422.42 B: no we've been married for seven years and she just got it into her mind uh pretty much last year that this was something that we should do 

422.23 427.03 B: which really kind of bothered me because i used to work at i used to work at m._s._n._b._c. and microsoft 

426.75 427.73 A: uh-huh 

426.85 437.49 B: um and that's that's the other end of town for me and i and and i wanted this was two or three years ago and i wanted a bike you know to avoid that horrible traffic and be able to get there in a decent amount of 

436.35 439.28 A: right yeah yeah it's awful over that bridge 

438.69 448.14 B: and she uh and she thought that that was just a horrible idea and it just wasn't going to work at all and now you know two or three years later oh we should get motorcycles and ride them around 

448.04 454.10 B: so it was kind of a little late for me to take advantage of the carpool lane to to use the bike to get to work but 

452.26 453.53 A: right 

454.26 455.21 B: you know it 

454.46 458.78 A: (( there are a lot of people in seattle who ride bikes i i thought when i was up there )) 

458.44 465.84 B: yeah i i'm been really kinda surpris- i [mn] i don't know what it is i think it might be just uh some kind of 

466.01 476.38 B: cultural shift that they are seen as more legitimate or people have more money to play with or something like that but i just see a whole lot more bikes than i ever remember even even five years ago there are just a lot of bikes 

476.74 488.13 B: mostly they're people you know riding harleys who think that they're gonna be cool on a harley and then they ride it for a while and they realise they don't really like it that much and so you see 'em you know if you look in the want ads there are just zillions of harleys for sale 

488.55 489.87 B: [sigh] but uh 

490.08 495.23 B: you know i do- i don't really know what it is but it's certainly you certainly see a lot more of 'em 

494.89 502.74 A: [sigh] [sigh] it's probably a little bit of everything a little more disposal income and you know i don't know there's a lot of young guys up there you know wanting to have a motorcycle 

502.15 505.54 B: yeah those are the cross rocket guys i see those guys 

503.83 513.47 A: yeah yeah i mean always yeah around like greenleaf a- around the lake and on the east side and stuff you always see a lot of guys riding busting around on their like you know bright yellow 

513.02 513.94 B: yes 

513.62 516.45 A: little suzuki guys or whatever they are 

515.87 525.50 B: right bent bent all the way over and on those you know just sprawled over the fuel tank and just kind of you know weaving in and out of traffic dangerously that kind of thing 

525.04 525.67 A: [sigh] 

525.78 537.83 A: i i tell you that you know like sometimes i get stuck in traffic here and then i just see the guy you know zoom right past down the middle and then you know [laughter] makes it a very very tempting sort of idea [sigh] to have one 

531.51 532.54 B: yeah 

536.35 540.79 B: yeah that's right that's legal to that's legal down there for them to do that if i remember 

540.51 549.75 A: yeah it's something because the the air it's air cooling or whatever they work on air cooling so they have to sorta keep moving or whatever but i mean whatever reason that's perfect 

546.92 548.54 B: yeah that's not 

549.34 561.26 B: yeah that's not really true any more most bikes are motor cooled now but yeah for some i guess for just traffic reasons you're just allowed to ride down i don't remember what that's called lane sharing or something but they're allowed to ride down the median between the cars 

561.23 566.72 A: [sigh] oh so that's not even true it's not even they they don't even work on air cooling any more 'cause 

561.32 562.96 B: i don't think that's legal up here 

565.73 575.69 B: no my my bike's water cooled my wife's bike is air cooled but my bike is water cooled and most bikes you know most bikes nowadays are water cooled that's except for like dirt bikes and really small bikes 

576.63 582.27 B: like my wife's bike is kind of unusual in that it's so large and it's actually air cooled so she actually has to keep moving 

582.81 584.83 A: is it is it because it's 

583.05 583.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

585.20 588.60 A: it's not you said it was a new bike though so it's not because it's old 

587.97 598.99 B: yeah it's a i i don't know i guess they just wanted uh that's just you know a design decision that they made you know for that price point or the bike so they made it it's a it's what they call a thumper it's a single cylinder bike
