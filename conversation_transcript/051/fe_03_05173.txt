169.48 171.40 A: oh yeah definitely 

170.81 175.04 B: you know if if the if there was more daylight i think 

174.40 175.59 A: yeah 

174.99 189.99 B: you'd you even if you came home at six o'clock and the sun was still up you might have a little more ambition to go you know maybe go for a walk or maybe go over you know g- uh go do something i know you know in the summertime when you know it's light out you know 

183.44 184.41 A: yeah 

189.90 198.65 B: and you get home from work at seven eight o'clock and you'll run up to the store you'll do that but if if it's wintertime and it's cold and it's dark you stay home 

197.05 200.49 A: that's right yeah that's that's absolutely 

199.86 202.92 B: yeah i mean it's it i i think

225.90 226.92 A: right 

226.31 233.40 B: you know uh [mn] nothing to you know be a pain in the butt or anything but you know but i thought 

227.00 227.89 A: right 

233.46 240.49 B: this winter and everybody said no the sun came out every day for maybe about an hour 

240.46 249.92 B: even when it was ten or twenty degrees and i tell ya when that sun came out it was just like you know it doesn't even feel that cold when the sun's out 

247.39 250.83 A: (( hm right right yeah ))

269.39 270.44 B: mhm
