76.67 77.78 B: yeah 

80.82 81.61 B: (( um )) 

81.63 87.37 B: so probably it's like the leaders are playing games all around 

86.92 89.62 A: [noise] ye- uh playing games you say 

89.47 90.81 B: yeah 

90.32 91.41 A: in what way 

91.44 99.85 B: i mean they let us know what they're doing so it's just the it's just the citizens who are suffering at the leaders i just think i think so 

100.38 102.59 A: mhm what 

102.80 116.32 B: i'm not really thinking of the big issue i'm just thinking of the little the little games they're playing or how to have control of the oil or the families in possession of the oil so there's gonna be a big fight with another country you know 

116.34 123.82 B: if the leaders could just if if the leaders could just resolve that and we don't have to have no crisis in the middle east though 

124.03 130.21 A: well are you referring to uh iraq specifically or egypt or the israelis or [noise] 

128.40 131.58 B: ye- yeah iraq specifically 

130.61 140.82 A: iraq specifically that is that is a tough area and a tough call i think [noise] uh do you think the the move by the united states recently was 

140.76 147.49 A: warranted if it's authorized do you think it did any good [noise] do you think it did any good 

143.90 144.90 B: pardon 

146.71 147.65 B: (( the war )) 

147.78 154.20 A: [noise] uh yes the recent war that was conducted there do you think that was worthwhile or do you think it served its purpose 

154.31 164.04 B: i think practically it helped the citizens of the country but i don't think it's of any benefit to the united states but it did practically help the citizens of iraq 

164.02 165.12 A: [noise] i would agree 

165.40 170.22 B: so th- i'm saying that if it's just to benefit 

170.83 179.96 B: well i'm saying practically they're making us they're making say it only benefited the citizens of iraqis but definitely you gonna see that the top 

176.56 177.39 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

180.09 182.69 B: the top people in power by new year 

184.08 185.63 B: (( you understand what i'm saying )) 

185.37 192.67 A: [noise] i think so uh the top people in power do you mean uh the u._s. government 

193.52 197.87 B: [noise] yeah the u._s. government ex- exactly that's what i mean by the people in power 

197.26 199.26 A: mhm 

198.85 206.04 B: i mean it it's meant to be a war then it's meant to benefit the citizens of the country that's fighting the war 

206.23 216.27 B: not the other party or not the party well right now apparently i think the war benefit is basically what the war was meant to do was to benefit the 

216.26 225.92 B: the government of the united states of america but indirectly it's benefited the iraqis because yeah they're losing they're losing the terror in the country 

225.95 227.54 B: ah big deal 

227.77 228.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

228.21 242.98 A: well i i would i don't know for sure but i think to them uh at least the majority of the reports that i've seen on television that it is kind of a big deal to them at least there aren't any more concentration camps as far the torture chambers and that sort of thing that that's stopped now 

243.29 244.67 B: yeah that's [noise] 

243.35 248.58 A: [noise] uh i don't i don't believe everything [noise] that i see on television regarding the middle east [noise] but i think 

248.87 254.68 A: if you get the same reports from various channels [noise] then there's probably some truth there 

254.78 256.27 A: uh out- [noise] 

255.14 260.73 B: yeah well you know the media is only gonna give out what they ask them to give out do 

261.41 262.92 B: (( you understand what i'm saying )) 

261.56 262.66 A: [noise] do you think 

262.69 266.17 A: do you think it's deliberate uh mis- misleading then 

265.76 269.45 B: [noise] it could be it could be 

270.33 272.15 B: (( you understand what i'm saying )) 

272.31 279.29 A: [noise] [noise] yeah uh i don't know that i would agree necessarily [noise] that uh all the media outlets would be [noise] um 

279.37 283.08 A: lying necessarily i have seen some middle east reports though 

279.66 280.29 B: (( mm )) 

283.52 284.68 B: (( you have )) 

284.34 291.98 A: yeah i've seen some middle east reports that pretty much indicate the same thing that i would see on [noise] say c._n._n. or fox television 

292.50 293.54 A: uh 

292.55 299.53 B: i mean it's like until years after when people when the people get this envision of what happened during the war 

297.89 299.09 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

299.54 302.57 B: that's when it could really come true about war you 

302.53 305.45 A: [noise] yeah [noise] sure [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

302.97 304.46 B: (( understand what i'm saying )) 

304.82 311.23 B: but for now it's just what we see 'cause it's just a short period it's it was like 

311.37 315.05 B: okay i'm gonna look at it like saddam hussein's been the 

315.54 321.78 B: head of state what- whatever he is he he knows u- united states is coming to battle him right 

322.18 323.24 A: okay 

322.18 327.70 B: and he's just gonna stay down there without reinforcing themselves don't you believe it's uh magic 

328.42 332.45 A: [noise] uh it seems to me like he abandoned his country 

331.55 336.63 B: to me no i don't think he aband- because he needed the oil he needed the power 

336.72 346.11 B: i'm not saying if he if he just waited like that or if he abandoned the country i think he's up to something which we not knowing 

346.26 348.16 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well i would agree to that 

346.51 347.56 B: i think we 

347.77 350.78 B: i think we only hear like half of the story 

350.34 352.63 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

351.45 360.21 B: we need we need the full story we need to know why he abandoned the country or we need to know the main reason why u._s. is trying to get in the country 

360.73 362.24 A: [noise] [noise] do you think you'll ever know 

362.36 363.32 B: pardon 

363.08 367.01 A: [noise] do you think you will ever know or find out that information [noise] 

366.49 367.72 B: no 

367.67 369.03 A: no [noise] 

368.39 374.14 B: no but the the stories will come out [noise] okay i will say something about um the 

374.27 376.40 B: the nine eleven attack 

377.34 379.67 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

377.67 390.04 B: okay yeah they they say it's something about the f._b._i. knowing about it trying to resolve all the issues before the before before the main incident but did we know about that no we only got to know that a terrorist attacked the country now 

389.95 400.62 B: later on we started hearing the news about the f._b._i. knowing not taking immediate actions knowing that the were in some country renting a motel were living in luxury of 

400.72 404.29 B: they opened up a bank account you heard all that story 

405.46 408.40 A: [noise] mm some [noise] not all 

408.42 413.78 B: i'm saying if you if they knew about this before and they didn't take immediate action 

410.29 411.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

414.06 421.42 B: and it's until after the nine eleven [mn] the terrorists themselves [noise] the hijackers were under surveillance right 

414.41 416.09 A: yeah 

417.77 419.15 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

420.80 425.13 A: (( [noise] uh partly yeah i i heard that [noise] [noise] )) 

423.24 426.09 B: (( yeah the hijackers were under surveillance and i'm like )) 

426.12 432.23 B: if they were under surveillance why did you have to wait to the last minute so it's i'm i'm gonna relate that to 

432.81 436.77 B: the middle east right now they know this is on they know that it's going on 

436.97 444.58 B: oh we need we need to also i'm not going to believe what i see on t._v. because the media is only gonna show what the leaders ask them to show 

445.03 446.62 B: do you agree with that 

446.16 458.20 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] uh only partly i i do believe that there is some truth in the media although it needs to be looked at carefully [noise] i don't think they always lie but at the same time there there there is some truth there 

457.96 466.29 A: [noise] uh at least in this part of the country where i am uh media outlets are generally more trusted i think than abroad 

462.92 465.34 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

468.49 482.77 A: [noise] i don't know as far as the rest of the middle east for example israel and palestine and whether or not there'll be a palestinian state i believe that that's probably probably gonna happen in the long run but i don't believe that there will be peace 

482.90 486.60 A: at least uh not in our time anyway 

486.05 488.17 B: (( mhm mm you think saddam is dead )) 

488.55 490.33 A: [noise] i'm sorry 

489.45 491.64 B: do you think saddam hussein is dead 

492.10 493.28 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

494.24 496.62 A: i'm not sure um 

497.63 507.37 A: i think he probably is [noise] he seemed to me to be the type of man that uh like being in the [noise] spotlight and he's not in the spotlight right now 

507.89 518.33 A: [noise] so i if if he can get back into the the spotlight he will and if he was alive i believe that he would try be trying to do that [noise] so i think he's probably dead 

515.63 517.03 B: (( [noise] well he he )) 

517.31 519.73 B: maybe he's just trying to reinforce himself [noise] 

519.63 521.09 A: [noise] you think so 

520.86 526.35 B: because even after the war i had the u- united states soldiers are still being killed right 

525.59 527.27 A: [noise] right 

527.14 531.76 B: so if the if he was really dead then nobody else 

531.93 538.80 B: you know or the leader is dead why am i still why am i still [noise] why am i still bothering myself you get it 

538.88 541.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah i think so um i believe [noise] )) 

540.50 541.26 B: (( good )) 

542.39 549.94 B: you know which which which makes me think that i don't think he's really dead i think he's just somewhere reinforcing himself 

542.45 544.25 A: i think [noise] 

545.85 547.30 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

551.27 555.72 A: what do you think do you think he's um [noise] gonna make a comeback so to speak [noise] 

555.86 562.87 B: i don't think i don't think he has enough forces to make a comeback but i'm just thinking he might come back to the spotlight 

563.21 566.95 A: [noise] in that case he's nothing more than [noise] say osama bin laden 

566.32 569.15 B: [noise] uh i 

567.96 571.38 A: i mean he's on the run too 

570.22 570.78 B: (( [cough] )) 

571.23 573.46 B: they they are like they 

573.88 584.41 B: oh i don't know it's which brings us back to the crisis in the middle east right really brings us back to the crisis in the midd- i mean i think those people are 

578.58 579.67 A: (( true )) 

584.92 586.19 B: they 

586.53 592.56 B: they terrorists that's what i'm gonna put them as at [sigh] they are out there to terrorize us much as they could 

592.86 593.89 A: mhm 

593.54 599.89 B: the only thing we could try to do is try to bring them down but indirectly they're affecting other citizens okay
