52.38 61.95 A: because it's really hard um it's when it when it comes to friends it's um you know it's it's kinda it's it's it's a it's a hard meaning to define at times because 

61.77 72.12 A: there are true friends and there are so called friends true friends are ones are people that accept you for who you are they accept me for who i am what i do 

71.97 74.91 A: and they respect me in every single way you know 

74.74 88.98 A: and they're true and honest with you you know the- they're not misleading so called friends are people just i've had plenty of those pretending to be my friends and they're not they stab you right on the back they lie and um you know it's like um you know it's 

88.91 91.79 A: it's actions speak louder than words you know 

92.03 101.90 A: and i've lots of acquaintances you know um for the most part in my life you know i prefer i i i make all people that have in contact with me acquaintances at first 

101.93 112.71 A: and then um and then right after i get to know 'em for a while and i determine what type of people they are then i i make my determination as to whether i want them to be my friends or not you know what i'm saying 

113.08 114.06 B: yes 

113.67 120.08 A: yeah now what's um how what's your experience with friendship can you tell me a little bit about it and acquaintances 

120.90 129.41 B: [mn] yeah primarily i had some of the same instances that you have um [mn] well i have a couple of 

129.62 134.12 B: friends i talk to regularly and and then there's 

134.17 140.77 B: ah so called friends as you'd say and and they are they don't ah [laughter] 

136.74 137.84 A: right 

141.08 145.67 B: i'd just sooner not be with 'em they're 'cause they act like they're two faced 

145.76 150.25 B: say one thing to you one way and then do other stuff behind your back 

145.76 146.94 A: right 

151.30 152.77 B: if you know what i mean 

152.52 158.23 A: i i i know exactly what you mean i i experienced this on my job i have two coworkers of mine 

158.09 169.64 A: who i thought were um were friends to me i was a little leery of them at first but then i said you know i give everybody a second chance a chance in life and see what happens you know learn through through experience 

169.77 178.25 A: it turned out that these people were like betraying me you know trying to you know um set me up into something which almost got me into trouble on my job 

178.18 188.62 A: and my god it was a dramatic experience and then i said to myself well i'm not going to bother with these two any more i'm just going to pray for them and keep 'em out of my way and that's it 

188.43 200.17 A: and just talk to my friends friends that are my true friends that really care about me accept me for who i am don't give me a hard time and don't mislead me in any way you know what i'm saying 

199.98 201.72 B: yeah 

200.49 204.44 A: and um i i learnt for myself that as far as friends 

204.45 209.96 A: you know even if you have two or three friends or even one close friend in your life 

210.24 224.49 A: along with the people that that like you you know acquaintances families family members you know um that that's all you really need you know what i'm saying it's best to have one or two great friends in your life that you feel comfortable and happy with 

224.58 234.13 A: instead of having a whole bunch that are that are ro- that are rotten apples you know what i'm saying in that case it's better not to have any friends because that way you don't get misled or anything you know 

234.18 235.79 B: [sigh] yeah that's for sure 

235.89 239.95 B: sometimes it's better to be around your enemies than your so called friends [sigh] mm 

239.07 243.85 A: right it's like they say misery loves company you know so a lot of these so called friends 

243.63 258.49 A: pretend to be your friends and they just use you for whatever you have like money or you know your personality m- a way of um using you as a target to make fun of you and the way you speak the way you do things you know what i'm saying or if a person's a little over weight 

258.48 264.95 A: and i i learnt that throughout all throughout all um i i learnt that throughout my entire life you know what i'm saying 

264.71 273.84 A: and then i said you know whenever it comes to meeting new people as far as determining if i want them to be my friends or not i gotta use you gotta use discretion you know 

273.95 284.98 A: you gotta interview them they interview you and you just gotta it's it's it's from a kinda point of perception you know what i'm saying where you gotta be very very cautious nowadays you know 

281.41 282.39 B: yes 

284.83 294.72 A: because the best [mn] the best friends are the hard are are the hardest to find you know what i'm saying go- it's harder to it's harder to find good than it is bad in this world 

294.84 298.90 B: yeah i know my so called friends got me fired from a job one time [laughter] 

298.85 301.38 A: you you got fired because of them 

300.71 307.87 B: yeah i got fired from a job because of my so called friends helping me out [laughter] if you know what i mean 

306.00 312.82 A: [sigh] oh yes i i i i believe that absolutely i believe that and i know i i know how to these so 

312.79 323.70 A: called friends they try to make up things and then they try to gather a whole bunch of their other real friends that are manipulators together in order to make you look bad you know what i'm saying 

323.15 324.16 B: yes 

323.67 327.83 A: and it's a shame to have people like that in this world you know and um 

327.72 337.01 A: you know it's like you know i i i try to stay out of their ways you know i don't wish any death on them or hatred because of that's not good you know but i say kill 'em with kindness 

336.81 347.43 A: and just bring me the right people and at times i i spent a lot of times alone at times because my my true friends aren't available to be with me at certain times 

347.32 354.60 A: so i you know at that at the moment when that happens i'm my own best friend you know what i'm saying i'm my own best company 

354.56 365.28 A: and then you know um then i i come to visit you know i come to visit people that i know acquaintances or people that are my second best friends and take it from there you know what i'm saying 

364.66 365.64 B: (( [sigh] yes )) 

365.28 378.54 A: and you know i have a dear friend from college you know who i went to college with majoring in accounting and this is a true friend that i call she speaks with me on the phone if i ever need so- somebody to speak with if i'm depressed or anxious 

378.42 387.00 A: she listens to me gives me feedback we see each other on occasions and you know that's that's what you call a true friend you know what i'm saying 

386.62 387.61 B: mhm 

387.08 395.02 A: somebody that's serious somebody that cares about you somebody that will accept you the way you are and will not make judgements on you you know 

395.33 397.25 B: yeah i agree with that 

396.46 404.60 A: you know i mean it's good to have friends it's very its it's very healthful but on the other hand like um let's say when it comes to 

404.39 405.28 A: to your 

405.09 412.28 A: to um to work in the workplace friendship is not an option your performance at the job is number one priority 

412.10 420.25 A: because that's what you're going to be judged by you're not there to make friends you're not there for a social life you're there to provide your employer with a day's work 

420.78 435.58 A: and of course if you make go- if you make friends on the job that's good too you know because that's how a lot of people learn but if you don't it's just important just to do your work like i mostly do just do my work wait till my shift is up and go home and that's it i mostly 

420.86 421.62 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

435.47 442.98 A: try to stay to myself at work as much as possible especially work when you work in an office because you know how office politics go you know 

443.26 450.95 A: and a lot of the gossip creates animosity towards friends there already and you know and you know that's um you know 

450.96 459.99 A: you know really i just prefer to make friends outside of the work place in my social life not not in my work not not in my business type life you know 

459.50 460.71 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

460.19 462.16 A: they're two separate things you know 

462.14 463.63 B: right 

463.33 466.09 A: mm how do you feel about that 

465.17 468.26 B: yeah i i agree with you a hundred percent on that that's seems like a 

468.47 474.91 B: good way to do things there on that because not only your workplace there are a lot of times ah 

474.96 479.33 B: they just ah try to use you to get what they can out of you and then they 

479.66 481.98 B: ditch you when they get all they can out of you 

482.10 493.38 A: exactly sure exactly and then and also notice that they don't take no for an answer if you don't agree with them in any way then they start um to pulling tricks on you and all that you know 

493.01 494.20 B: yeah 

493.64 494.86 A: yeah 

495.32 497.20 B: yeah that's for sure yeah 

496.65 501.58 A: yeah and what tom like when when it comes to ah approaching friends like um 

501.49 513.82 A: like um are are you are you selective in the friends that you choose or do you like somebody some group of people around your age or does it matter or how um you know how do um you know what is your preference 

514.09 515.29 B: (( well i )) 

515.41 517.39 A: and among acquaintances 

517.11 521.35 B: pretty much round my age group seems like to work best for me anyway 

521.35 529.40 A: right you wouldn't have things that you have in com- wh- things that um that they're mo- that they most likely have in common or like to talk about right 

528.80 529.91 B: right 

529.30 537.28 A: rather than right you don't wanna be like around a bunch of ki- like me too you know i don't wanna be around a bunch of kids or teenagers as friends because 

537.07 544.18 A: i'm much older than that and you know um we may have some things in common but it's it's not the same you know i wanna feel peo- 

544.03 554.04 A: i want people to be at my level at my maturity level and things that i like to talk about you know and that have similar thinking to what that i that i do you know what i'm saying 

553.70 554.67 B: yes 

554.42 569.17 A: you know and um because it's um you know everybody's it's good to be in an age group where you feel comfortable at like most people do other people it doesn't matter they have no problems a friend is a friend age is just a number you know what i'm saying which it is you know 

568.41 569.79 B: mhm 

568.94 575.04 A: it's it's pra- it's basically how um how you perceive things in life your level of maturity you know 

574.95 576.72 B: yeah that's for sure yeah 

575.89 582.79 A: you know i mean you could be i mean i i've had frien- i i've i've no i i've had friends and so called friends that are like um 

582.60 594.92 A: are like um t- you know are li- are like in their thirties or forties but on the other hand their mental age is like in their twenties or fif- or or or teens you know what i'm saying it's it's all according to your approach you know 

595.89 597.94 B: yes that's for sure there 

597.22 599.89 A: right and um you know it's it's um you know
