36.33 37.63 A: oh cool 

41.36 47.71 A: not really well my family lives in d._c. but i haven't been like much to the to the virginia coast line 

47.58 49.41 B: (( okay yeah um )) 

49.53 51.68 A: so we're supposed to talk about like something 

51.30 64.09 B: yeah uh the issues in the middle east and uh the unrest that exists there now whether or not we we expect there will ever be peace there and whether or not we should be part of the peace process 

53.66 54.62 A: okay 

60.45 61.75 A: (( mhm )) 

63.50 64.37 A: uh-huh 

65.01 66.20 B: um 

65.61 68.01 A: (( would you like to start do you want to start )) 

67.39 71.94 B: well to tell you the truth i i'm very bigoted on this issue 

72.02 72.99 A: oh really 

72.07 80.68 B: i don't think we have any business being there at all i think the whole thing is about oil i think our involvement is motivated by the oil companies 

80.63 87.93 B: and our refusal to take on environmentally friendly technologies for energy supplies 

87.97 88.83 A: uh-huh 

88.10 100.44 B: um and i think we're indulging the oil companies with our with the blood of our children i think the whole thing is totally wrong i think we need to get out i don't think there will be peace until we do get out and uh 

100.52 101.90 B: (( [mn] frankly )) 

102.08 109.61 B: e- even then there will probably not be eas- uh peace because of the israeli situation but frankly that's not our problem 

110.01 121.01 A: ah well i was gonna ask you know it's it's a good thing i was gonna ask you if you were gonna separate the israeli problem and the and the middle east it's like 

110.64 112.51 B: [laughter] 

113.98 115.10 B: [laughter] 

120.49 122.75 B: actually actually i i 

122.83 125.47 B: i don't think it can be separated 

125.00 132.81 A: no no no i mean i was more going into the oil parts because i mean there is you you got a point there's like a 

132.86 142.59 A: you you have to concede the- the oil situation that for the rest not for like israel and the palestinians that's like holy shit and it's like it's a mess 

142.15 143.36 B: yeah 

142.78 151.34 A: it is a mess and like as for the rest of the region like the oil it's it's very big it's a very big part of of the problem 

151.37 153.92 A: uh i think the main 

154.48 159.11 A: like problem though like related to violence is like the israeli problem 

158.50 159.79 B: mhm 

159.19 160.61 A: and that's 

160.71 165.83 A: i mean i think the u._s. should be like at least entitled to be involved but it's 

166.08 172.88 B: but to be quite honest now if you want to talk about the the unrest and the terrorism towards the israeli state then 

171.76 172.74 A: mhm 

172.95 186.37 B: i mean the israelis are the ones who taught those people that they taught england how to get what they wanted through terrorism um they established or motivated england uh to establish the israeli nation 

185.76 186.98 A: yeah 

186.34 195.87 B: by terrorism to begin with so how you know [laughter] so how in the hell can they turn around and condemn those people for using the same tactics for wanting their own 

187.92 190.41 A: yeah you're you're right about that 

196.12 197.19 B: um 

197.34 198.23 B: (( you know )) 

198.04 199.32 A: their own like 

198.26 198.91 B: (( uh )) 

199.22 201.87 B: yeah country exactly 

199.45 200.64 A: country 

201.32 208.63 A: yeah yeah you're right about that i agree with that they they use terrorism when when it used to be uh what is it a british uh 

208.60 218.34 B: yeah the british right dominion or whatever yeah right under a british protectorate although uh [laughter] it probably was the brits that needed the protection [laughter] 

209.09 211.27 A: british under british rule 

213.39 214.24 A: (( mm )) 

216.44 221.25 A: [laughter] yeah yeah yeah i agree with that they should not uh 

221.55 228.35 A: they should not be so quick to condemn it and when they use the same thin- the same the same tactics 

227.81 229.12 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

228.56 234.90 A: as as as the palestinians are using now that's why i think that's the only reason i think that you should be like 

235.00 236.26 A: more 

236.36 243.53 A: into pressing the israelis seem to into keeping the palestinians state 

243.46 244.46 B: mhm 

243.85 258.28 A: that's the only part i i mostly think the u._s. the the only role i think the u._s. has to do with there like with the israelis seem to agreeing that um and the creation of some palestinian state that's about it because the rest is 

259.28 263.12 A: there is no need to go there and like make enemies it's hard as it is 

262.84 263.76 B: really 

263.77 265.27 A: yeah it's hard as it is 

264.50 269.16 B: and [mn] and this is to a great extent a religious war 

269.35 270.57 A: yeah 

269.55 273.72 B: uh it maybe it's maybe religion is only the pawn 

273.79 281.73 B: of economics i'm not sure but for a lot of people i'm sure that the religion is a big part of of the cause and a purpose for the war 

281.65 283.20 A: it is becoming 

281.93 282.70 B: and 

282.95 283.91 B: yeah 

283.33 285.53 A: it is becoming especially like 

285.82 291.37 A: things for a large group of israelis it's it's written in their 

292.37 298.39 A: in their scriptures that it's their land and it's given by god they're not gonna there's just they're not going to go and they 

298.55 302.35 A: and it's becoming much more of an issue with uh 

302.61 304.76 A: the way the muslims have been 

304.85 309.43 A: have been responding to that in i don't know the last twenty years i guess 

308.84 310.63 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

310.15 313.37 A: like that also i at least like my 

313.71 316.78 A: like my view is that it's been getting a lot more 

317.44 330.15 A: more at least on the muslim side more radical i think this is our land and they they are jews and they should they should die because they are not they are not muslims and it's it's has been turning that way 

326.10 327.02 B: yeah 

330.05 332.75 A: and since the u._s. is supporting israel 

332.91 334.18 A: (( it's uh )) 

334.08 338.82 B: it's becoming more hardline on the part of the muslims what and 

335.92 336.88 A: mhm 

337.41 342.05 A: mhm and it's becoming the anger is also coming into into us into the u._s. 

341.45 344.14 B: right and i and i think for that reason 

344.16 355.08 B: uh alone we we need to back off and serve m- mainly only as a mediary but not as a participant in in this struggle 

350.00 351.79 A: mhm 

353.04 357.21 A: yeah yeah the so i i think and it's pretty hard you know because they're 

357.25 363.13 A: i mean i don't have anything about any particular group i think they're like killing each other but like 

360.54 361.57 B: mhm 

363.26 366.51 A: politics are like very 

366.53 367.94 A: (( national )) 

368.01 370.17 A: national interests here 

369.24 370.97 B: right right mhm 

370.36 379.12 A: there is like very powerful groups like lobbying for for israel in particular like palest- the the muslim or palestine groups have no 

379.42 381.46 A: not a big local 

381.49 388.27 A: network of support as the palestinians so it so it's i think the u._s. it's going to have a pretty 

388.47 393.96 A: very difficult and like trying to solve that uh as long as there is no 

394.61 399.93 A: no balance here or no strong will and to get them to 

400.10 404.10 A: the israelis and the palestinians to have sort of like balance over there 

404.30 408.63 A: i don't think there's gonna be much much progress in that in that area 

407.52 415.50 B: well you know it wasn't it you know was there was a time in history when the muslims and moors ruled a great deal 

415.75 417.18 A: i know yeah 

417.00 423.41 B: ruled all of that area and even ruled a lot of spain and it allowed the christians to have their relig- their religion 

423.33 427.18 A: yeah yeah actually wow that's that's very 

425.68 427.28 B: so i don't think 

427.38 432.99 B: this is a fundamental religious issue i think the re- the issue has become 

433.08 442.13 B: uh fundamentalist and extremist only because of intolerance on mostly on the part of the christian the judeo christian community 

435.65 436.58 A: mhm 

441.79 443.79 A: community oh that's 

444.01 445.09 A: that's pretty 

445.23 445.95 B: it's 

445.48 451.91 A: that's the first time i heard that comment because yes it's right the muslims mores went all the way up to 

451.95 453.16 B: yeah 

452.32 455.45 A: to spain like my family's originally from spain 

455.64 461.97 A: so i know a lot about that part and they did and it's like it's a big part of at least of spanish culture there 

461.38 462.94 B: (( sure yeah )) 

462.05 465.27 A: and mores is like the mosques and 

464.90 473.87 B: and and the jews were even allowed to practice their own religion and to have their own banking system under the more under the mores rulers 

473.54 478.59 A: mhm and actually they were the they were the 

478.77 488.15 A: they mean ways of spreading knowledge of their era at there that time of dominance a lot of like math and science was right 

483.22 485.57 B: mhm right right 

486.67 492.62 B: sure public public education and all the rest of that they were a very benevolent ru- uh 

488.78 490.27 A: (( to break through that )) 

492.74 495.25 B: ruler if you want to call them that you know 

495.13 496.73 A: yeah well it's 

495.73 496.29 B: (( [mn] )) 

497.16 501.06 A: it's hard [sigh] it was a long time ago it was a long time ago 

499.42 505.05 B: sure and it and it certainly doesn't equate to today but it does equate to ideologies of religion 

504.67 509.20 A: yeah yeah i can see it should it should we should like to try to 

509.98 511.34 B: be tolerant at least 

510.69 513.18 A: yeah be tolerant and uh 

513.39 516.38 A: and especially try to be the deviate this 

516.60 518.59 A: from base like religious 

518.87 529.97 A: of terrorists it's faking i mean that's the reason the like why nine eleven and all those terrorist things are happening they they they aren't i mean it's not the main reason but they think 

529.98 535.71 A: we are just out to destroy the muslim the muslim community of the world 

534.45 535.31 B: mhm 

535.38 536.59 B: mhm 

535.97 538.67 A: which i don't think it's like really there 

538.83 544.96 A: the the the goal of of at least of the u._s. government or like the 

543.73 550.10 B: i don't believe it's the it's certainly not the goal of the people and it's not i don't th- think it's the goal of the u._s. government 

549.76 550.55 A: no 

550.17 558.74 B: if if but if it weren't for the israeli nation and if it weren't for the oil the oil first in the israels the israeli nation if you want to call it that 

558.54 559.44 A: (( mhm )) 

559.25 562.19 B: second i don't think we would give a damn 

562.45 563.71 B: to be quite frank 

563.89 571.24 A: yeah yeah yeah it's the only situation the oil it's uh that's another issue it's so difficult uh 

565.88 566.44 B: (( [mn] )) 

571.47 575.77 A: there is so many people and economies depending on it 

576.75 587.47 A: i mean i'm not saying it's good or anything but you need to to make sort of a smooth transition from oil to to to a different energy source 

587.01 596.76 B: yeah to alternate energy sources however th- that's not going to happen because you can make a lot of profit from oil you can't make a lot of profit from wind or solar 

588.56 589.62 A: (( yeah [mn] [noise] )) 

595.60 599.95 A: no you cannot or from uh hydrogen or or or solar power you can't 

598.25 599.22 B: right
