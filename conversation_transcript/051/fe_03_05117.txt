215.23 223.00 A: you know with israel and palestine i mean they've gotta figure out to do something there but uh 

217.97 218.55 B: (( mhm )) 

224.53 226.53 A: i'm really [mn] 

226.78 228.95 A: not sure uh

259.19 260.27 B: mhm 

261.92 264.51 A: (( you know i oh )) 

265.39 268.45 A: i would say that oh 

270.02 274.50 A: and yassar arafat i mean you know he's 

275.84 279.79 A: sort of a terrorist i mean we've got to 

279.91 282.91 A: figure out what to do about him 

282.66 284.31 B: mhm 

284.83 288.02 B: but he's uh do you really think that he's a threat 

289.53 291.65 A: i a 

292.32 295.54 A: threat to us or a threat to israel 

293.82 294.72 B: (( yeah to )) 

295.06 297.00 B: the united states 

297.94 302.56 A: i don't think he's a threat to the u._s. but oh 

303.30 307.06 A: i think that oh he 

308.69 316.42 A: definitely was involved in terroristic activity and he's an old guy and he probably 

316.61 319.65 A: isn't the right person to lead palestine 

319.35 321.37 B: mhm 

321.53 323.44 B: yeah i agree 

322.82 327.39 A: but i think there are a lot of groups that oh 

328.76 336.87 A: you know that are attacking israel that would like to attack us if they could oh 

335.53 336.96 B: mhm 

338.23 339.41 A: (( you know )) 

340.93 343.85 A: i mean those are my opinions for 

344.67 349.45 A: for uh what they're worth i mean you know they're a oh 

350.46 354.65 A: you know it's an important region in the world and oh 

355.82 359.79 A: we ought to do something but i think 

360.28 365.65 A: um the problem with this topic is there really aren't any easy answers 

364.30 365.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

366.29 376.99 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

367.50 368.76 A: so 

369.60 370.68 A: um 

372.31 377.61 A: you know i mean israel has a right to exist doesn't it 

377.08 379.83 B: (( yes it does mhm i agree [noise] )) 

379.18 381.43 A: but uh 

381.48 384.24 B: [noise] 

382.05 384.63 A: the palestinians 

385.50 389.41 A: should have a right to some sort of state too 

389.21 391.32 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

391.01 395.45 A: but you know the question is uh 

395.74 405.51 A: how are they going to divide the territory i mean that's uh that's the big issue i mean i read that israel's putting up this huge fence 

400.79 402.17 B: yeah 

406.63 415.17 A: you know some of which is in the palestinian part and you know if they put up this huge fence it's gonna be rather hard to move 

414.83 417.15 B: (( it is mhm )) 

418.12 420.24 A: so oh 

422.20 428.31 A: you know are you how interested are you in the middle east 

427.85 431.35 B: i'm not really much that interested in it 

431.79 434.59 B: (( i'm more focused on the uh )) 

434.62 443.07 B: terror alerts why does it keep going up and down they ain't no idea whether that saddam alive or dead that's my thing 

444.64 446.81 A: well um 

448.30 450.52 A: yeah i 

451.42 456.84 A: think that's uh those are good questions i mean um

461.39 464.13 A: i don't either it uh 

466.75 468.53 A: sorry i'm just um 

469.06 471.59 A: just sipping some tea here um 

472.12 477.96 A: yeah i mean the terror alert went back down which i guess is a good thing 

476.83 478.47 B: mhm 

478.74 489.94 A: and the terrorists don't seem to have attacked us i think that's a that's a good thing 

489.48 491.14 B: yes it is 

490.43 493.31 A: (( but oh )) 

494.59 500.56 A: you know i just wonder why the military has a hard time finding saddam i mean 

501.79 505.29 A: you know there are lots of people who want to find him 

504.41 506.58 B: mhm 

506.02 508.18 A: maybe he went to disney world
