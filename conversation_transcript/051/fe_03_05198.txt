183.88 190.50 A: yeah yeah it's either the west coast or the east coast i think that's where the uh the best food is 

190.07 195.10 B: yeah but you know what ch- chicago's got some really good restaurants right in the middle [mn] yeah 

193.98 203.82 A: that's true that's true that's true i think it's as long as it's kind a culturally mixed you get different types of food and makes it that little bit more interesting 

201.14 202.23 B: mhm 

204.04 212.30 B: yeah i i mean you know it all de- it all depends on um you know where what you're gonna fi- you know where you gonna find the 

212.10 224.59 B: [mn] like you said we it really has a lot to do with uh culturally uh you know there's all there's all big a lot of [mn] ethnics ethnic here uh then there then uh you get uh you know there's more variety more 

218.65 220.11 A: mhm 

224.78 229.10 A: yeah seafood is pretty good in new york as i recall it too 

225.96 226.82 B: (( uh )) 

229.02 243.75 B: yeah seafood seafood yeah you can get some good seafood here because i mean we're you know not that [mn] not that far we got the port you know you got a port right there i mean there's a big seafood market uh down at the uh south street seaport um so that you know it's it's relatively fresh 

235.72 237.56 A: yeah

240.15 242.17 A: (( yeah ))

245.86 249.35 B: and what what do you usually uh go out for out in texas [mn] 

248.49 260.46 A: well [laughter] in texas there's really not much choice it's either a tex mex or uh or a steak inn [mn] it it's never really a salad meal you know it's it's always meat and potatoes 

257.24 258.18 B: yeah 

260.16 261.29 B: (( mhm )) 

260.82 266.48 A: and uh now now i'm in the east coast and everything's a little bit more balanced you know people'll tend to have 

266.71 268.99 A: to watch their weight you know they 

269.31 277.67 A: [mn] food is pretty important [mn] to watch your calories all that good stuff so you know got a break in the salad and the fruits every now and then

277.70 278.96 B: mhm 

278.52 280.76 A: yeah um 

280.72 294.57 A: the um seafood here is definitely exceptional i think that's part of uh why i have to say that that was part of my equation of moving to the east coast yeah

291.90 293.09 B: (( mm yeah )) 

293.74 296.57 B: oh yeah you get you get some really good s- i mean
